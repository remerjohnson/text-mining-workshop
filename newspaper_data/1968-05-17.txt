Prophet Company 
Replacement Named By 
Food Services Comm. 

This week the student Food 
Services Committee nominated 
and the Business Office accepted 
the High Continental Food Com-
pany as a replacement for Pro-
phet, the present concessioner. 

Working under the Schultz Plan, 
Continental will offer such things 
as five entrees for dinner, self-
service sandwich bars, restaur-
ant catering with lobster and 
New York cut on the menus, and 
the University 'wage to student 
employees. 

According to Jon Collins, a 
Muir Senator and member of the 
Food Services Committee, Con-
tinental is "very excited" about 
serving UCSD. "The small com-
pany has only 22 clients, in-
cluding the University of San 
Diego Women's College, and will 
be much more important to them 
to treat us well." 

fice Box number. If tickets are 
used without the purchaser's per-
mission, the offender may be 
suspended from the University. 

Among the outstanding features 
of Continental's plan described by 
Collins is an "instant-restaur-
ant," 

"Working with the AS," he 
explained, •• or any student group, 
Continental will be able to set 
up tables with ~ble-cloths and 
serve students, who are dressed 
up for some special occasion.

students can use their meal tick-
ets." 

Throughout the year the 12 
students on the Food Services 
Committee will review Conti-
nental's operations. Collins said 
that perhaps students will be 
asked to evaluate service and 
menu while eating in order to 
get valid feed-back from the 
residents.

Today has been designated by 
the 1\.S Senate as appropriate for 
discussion of white racism, be-
cause of Malcolm X's birthday 
on Sunday, 19 May. 

In a resolution passed at its 
emergency meeting last Monday, 
called by Revelle Senator Bill 
Eastman, the Senate urged "pro-
fessors and teaching assistants 
to devote their lecture and dis-
cussion hours to the topiC of 
white racism in America." 

Should the professors or TA's 
not comply with the suggestion, 
the resolution said, students 
should "remind that professor or 
teaching assistant of his respon-
sibility. " 

Provost Salt man commented 
that he could not tell professors 
how to run their classes. 

"It is in the perview of the 
professors as to what tMy should 
or should not do in their classes," 
he said. 

Saltman declined to attach his 
signature to the letter which was 
sent to the "University Com-
munity," or release any state-
ment in connection with the Sen-
ate's action. 

Provost Stewart also refused 
to direct professors at Muir Col-
lege to follow tbe resolution. 

"In my literature course," he 
said, "it happens that the mater-
ial is suited to Malcolm X's 
career. If the material in a 
course is related to lessons that 
might be learned from Malcolm's 
life, and there is time to dis-
cuss it, it is line." 

Dr. Robert Tschirgi, Vice-
Chancellor of Academic Affairs, 
remarked that Chancellor Gal-
braith had seen nothing wrong 
in tbe AS Senate's suggestion. 

"The University, of course, 
cannot declare a holiday by it-
self," he said. "Nor can the 
administration dictate to the fa-

Revelle 
On Dorm 

Today Votes 
Changes 

(BULLETIN: A referendum will 
be held for Revelle College resi-
dents today in connection with 
tbe policy change in the make-up 
of dorm suites. See the continua-
tion of this article on page 6 for 
details.) 

The Residence Hall Planning 
Committee has come up with sev-
eral new lnnovations that will 
change the structure of tbe Re-
velle College Residence Halls 
from the present social struc-
ture, based on suite unity, to a 
system based on dorm unity. Cal-
culated to make the dorms "more 
enjoyable and intellectually in-
teresting," the new system will 
make possible actions, social 

and athletic, on the dorm level. 
A memorandum to the students 

living on campus was posted late 
last week, and students were ask-
ed to vote on such items as co-
educational dorms. This plan 
would increase the communica-
tion and jOint activities between 
the male residents and the fe male 
residents. 

"The Committee felt that any 
company working under the 
Schultz Plan would be remarkably 
better than Prophet," Collins 
said. "They are willing to meet 
our demands and will encourage 
students to advise them on bet-
tering their operations." 

According to the Committee, 
which is chaired by Revelle Sena-
tor Paul Ricks, the Continental 
food next year will feature items 
that appeal to students. Popular 
items, like prime rib, will be 
offered three or four times a 
week. When students desire a 
certain item, and it is within 
the company's means, it will be 
served. 

Fall Quarter Registra 
To Begin May 27 

. Ion 

Among the other new ideas that 
the Com mittee agreed on was the 
plan for the formation of suites. 
Chief among their criticisms of 
the present system is that there 
is not enough contact between 
individual suites 10 the dormi-
tories. Therefore, in the fall, 
only six returning students in 
anyone particular suite will be 
able to return to the same suite 
in a group. Four new students, 
in all probability freshmen, will 
be placed in the suites. This 
will eliminate the great amount 
of freshman alienation from the 
rest of the school and promote 
the mingling of the upper and 
lower divisions. 

Under the Schultz Plan, which 
Prof. Sheldon Schultz of Physics 
Department put forth in the Win-
ter Quarter, students will buy 
coupon booklets or weekly meal 
cards, which are negotiable for 7 
days. They are transferable to 
any student, since Continental 
will be operating on the assump-
tion that all tickets will be ex-
hausted at the end of the week. 

If students lose their tickets, 
however, they may obtain re-
placements simply by showing 
cause and stating their Post 01-

Registration for the Fall Quar-
ter of 1968 will begin on Monday, 
May 27 and will continue through 
Tuesday, June 4, according to 
Dudley Wray, Acting Registrar. 

Also nest week (Thursday and 
Friday), the Registration and Ad-
mission Office will be moving 
to Matthews Campus, Building 
102. The new orfice is located 
in the recently completed buil-
ding behind the Matthews Cam-
pus Fire Station. 

This pre-registration proced-
ure will be similar to that of 
the last two quarters, namely, 
registration by mail. students 
will be able to pre-enroll by 
using "Preferred Program" 
cards and will be notified by 
mall wh ther their preferences 
for nect year's courses have 

been accepted. Notification of 
apP,l'oval will again follow the 
payment of Incidental Fees. 

The fir st opportunity for stu-
dents to see the new class sche-
dule will be Tuesday, May 21. 
Schedules w1ll be available in 
the Bookstore and the Sundry 
store (Revelle Commons) at 10 
am on that day. 

For the Fall, '68 Juniors and 
Seniors of Revelle College mu st 
have their Preferred Program

visors.

Temporary dorm governments, 
elected for the summ r nct early 
fall out of the students who will 
return to UCSD's residence halls 
in the fall, will function until 
regular elections are held when 
the entire dorm population is 
back to the dorm. These elections 
will give th dorms an active 
means of planning ctiviUes in 
the fall. Commuter students, who 
pay a $3.00 fee will be allowed 
to affiliate themselves with a 
particular dorm and partiCipate 
in all the activities of that dorm.

According to reliable sources, 
a film about Malcolm X will be 
presented in USB 2622 today at 
11 a.m. and seminars will be con-
ducted in the Revelle Plaza. 

In a message tothe University, 
the Black Students Union em-
phasized that the occasion "be a 
central intellectual concern in a 
University, not just a sentiment-
al extra-curricular matter and 
not just for a day." 

Salt man also questioned tbe 
purpose of devoting one day to a 
discussion of racism. .. This is 
tokenism, he said, "if a student 
feels that by spending a day on 
racism he will relieve his bur-
den. It is also bumper- sticker 
sloganism. I would bope that it is 
of daily concern to stUdents.' 

Salt man also wished the AS 
Senate had consulted with the 
faculty before making the uni-
lateral decision, "although they 
have the perogative to do so, if 
they fee 1 they ought to." 

Tom Shepard and Jon Collins 
had had reservations about the 
resolution because it demon-
strated the impotence of the A ~ 
by itself to affect the University. 
"It is a typical example of sand 
box government," Shepard said. 
"Just by passing a resolution 
the Senate cannot make the facul-
ty act." 

Collins abstained from voting 
for tbe motion because he felt 
the faculty should have been con-
sulted earlier. Steve Greenberg 
and Steve lshmae 1 were the only 
Senators who were not present to 
vote. 

New Gym

Due to a delay in finishing the 
floor of the new gymnasium, the 
special events planned this week-
end for opening the new facility 
have been relocated. 

Billed as the "last major event 
in the cafeteria," the Cal Tjader 
concert tonight will be held in 
Revelle Cafeteria and ticket sales 
will be limited to only 1000. The 

udent Activities Office warns 
that it will be difficult to buy

PRO: College Gov't Is 
Key To Efficiency 

For four years UCSD has been talking about the advantages of 
college government. The AS Constitution anticipates representation 
by the colleges, but it remains silent on each unit's actual set-up. 
Some of the student body are opposed to the system because they 
fear it would "subvert" student power, a hypothetical description 
of college government's advantages for the students ,ight altay their 
pessimism. 

Once a college gover 'lm,mt is in full operation, whether it follows 
the Revelle COSA plan or not, students will find their complaints 
about specific acadp.mic curro ~llia can be air1d. The college faculty 
will be abl~ to deal with student protests much mor~ seri.),!'5!; 11

campus-wide AS. In cons,!l~tions wit" intere'5ted students, professor"

In general, powerful college governments will be able to work 
together In shaping campus-wide policy by Influencing AS Senate 
actions. The colleges will lobby for their interests and the AS will . 
be more representative, in the end, because of their greater aware- ' 
ness of the student problems. Soon, the colleges will be most impor-
tant to the AS when matters of policy are presented, and consequently 
campus-wide activities will mean more to students at the colleges. 

Finally, once college governments are installed, the faculty and 
administration will have to follow their recommendations and since 
they will be involved in formulating them. In an atmosphere of co-
operation all three elements of the University community will be-
come integrated as they shape their future course. The naysayers 
are displaying a striking conservative image by fearing the con-
sequences of a new approach. The fact of the whole matter Is that 
college government can be the solution to student frustration if it 
is only given a try. 

CON: Don't Be Fooled 
Provost Paul Saltman appears beaming, paper in hand, HAPPILY 

announcing the wonderful, stimulating, FUN Revelle College student 
Government wich COSA (the Committee on Student AUairs) has 
supposedly proposed to him. Of course, he announces this over 
closed-circuit TV, one of the most deceptively trance-provoking 

, wonders of the modern media, and cancels class so EVERYONE 
(ho, ho, ho) can go WATCH! But when TV-TIME is over and bro-
ther Paul 's plan goes into effect, it's time for EVERYONE to watch 
OUT. 

The Provost Is a brilliant strategist, and any student Interested 
In campus life cannot afford to forget it. Saitman can make manure 
look like beefsteak, with just the wink of an eye and a turn of the 
head. And that's what he has done this time. COSA, In Spanish, means 
THINGS;i.nd that's just what students are in good old Paul's eyes: 
THINGS that he can manipulate so they never get out of hand (troub-
lesome little things they are), so they never have ANY power, never 
ANY say in decisions that deeply affect them. He has manipulated 
COSA into supporting a plan which translates best, "DIVIDE AND 
RULE." Next he will maniplllate YOU, and you won't even know 
it. He will turn YOU, collectively or individually, into THINGS, 
ciphers in the GREAT LB.M. CARD of the Yon-See-Ess-Dee Cam-
pus. 

Computers can be PROGRAMMEO to accept and feed back just 
what their controller FEEDS JNTO lhem. DON'T let SALTMAN 
(.:led YOU something that LOOKS like beefsteak, no matter HOW 
it' s seasoned. Don't let the Adminic;f r-lfin'l PRJGHAM YO)U OUT 
OF EXISn:~O:.

McCarthy Leads Choice 68 
Senator Eugene McCarthy, who 

achieved sizeable victory nation-
ally in the recent Choice 68 elec-
tion, fared even better at UCSD, 
receiving more than fifty percent 
of the vote_ Of an estimated 2248 
Tritons eligible, 1156 (51.4%) 
voted. The breakdown in the vo-
ting for presidental candidates 
was as follows: 

Eugene McCarthy 562 50.8% 

Robert Kennedy 134 12.1% 
Richard Nixon 113 10.2% 
Nelson Rockefeller 79 7.2% 
John Lindsay 31 2.8% 
Lyndon Johnson 31 2.8% 
Fred Halstead 28 2.5% 

The rest of the twelve candi-
dates received less than 2%each. 

Nationally, Mccarthy received 
28.1%, Kennedy 21.0%, Nixon 19. 
4%, Rockefeller 11.4%, and Pres-
ident Johnson 5.6%. 

L'etters ·to the Editor 
Editor, the Triton Times, 

The Interhall Councll has pro-
posed a "self-sustaining" plan 
for the regulation of student hous-
ing which they "predict" will 
improve living conditions "in 
five or six years." Assuming 
that living conditions need to be 
improved, must we then accept 
the totally in1lexible system 
which Interhall Council would 
impose? Must we sacrifice our 
freedom to choose our suite-
mates, the advantages of living 
with our friends, and even the 
quite successful upper division 
dorms because some group has 
presumed to know what is better 
for us? Certainly not, especially 
s ince the "integration of class-
es" that Interhal! Council teels 
is so important could be insti-
gated on the dorm level rather 
than on the suite level without 
the aforementioned sacrifices. I 
strongly urge Interhall Council to 

Editor, the Triton Times, 
Last week I had the unfortu-

nate experience of finding a 
green, live worm in my Prophet 
Company salad. Naturally worms 
are nice little creatures who don't 
bite and they do belong among 
the lush leaves of lettuce flower s. 
But I do think that their place in 
a dinner salad is hardly war-
ranted. 

1 can be thankful, of course, 
for finding a whole worm instead 
of just half a worm. After all I 
was able to avoid him and eat 
around his little body. The ques-
tion I have is whether other 
students have had similar ex-
periences at dinner time. What 
do you suppose lurks ins ide the 
multi-colored jelloes we eat? 

In the future I look forward to 
a wormless diet. Let this be a 
warning to Rosie in the cafeteria: 
Please clean off the leaves be-
fore tossing th lettuce! 

Sincerely, 
Holly Harrison 

reconsider its present position 
and support a dorm plan rather 
than the potentially destructive 
suite plan. 

Sincerely, a concerned 
student, 
Glenn Hakanson 

Editor, the Triton Times 
I am writing to you in the hope 

that you wUl communicate my 
appreciation to the students on 
your campus tor their CHOICE 
68 votes. 

Not only because my candidacy 
was favored in the balloting am I 
grateful. More significant than 
the success or the losses of indi-
vidual candidates in CHOICE 68 
is the partiCipation by one mil-
lion students on some 1200 cam-
puses in the political process. 
Student opinions, debated and ex-
presses democratically, will in-
fluence elections throughout our 
nation. 

CHOICE 68 opinions on mili-
tary action, bombing and the ur-
ban situation have been forwarded 
to me. I note that 55.4 percent 
of my student supporters favor a 
reduction of military action in 
Vietnam and 29.1 percent arefor 
withdrawal. Among students for 
me, 51.2 percent would stop the 
bombing and 28.4 percent prefer 
temporary suspension. 1 can as-
sure you I shall keep these views 
in mind as I try to develop in-
telligent responses to changing 
International relations. 

The emphasis ot students for 
McCarthy on education and job 
training in our urban reconcilia-
tion efforts is reassuring to me 
in a very personal way. Let us 
remain together, and I am confi-
dent that our common cause can 
change the direction of our coun-
try. 

With best wishes. 
Sincerely yours, 
Eugene J. McCarthy 

When It cam to the vote on 
military action and bombing in 
Vietnam, UCSD students proved 
to be even more "dovish" than 
the national average. Nationally 
the vote was 17.6% for imme-
diate withdrawl and 50% for 
phased reduction in mllitary ac-
tivity. The vote on bombing was 
more divided with 29% voting 
for cessation, 29% for suspen-
sion, 12% for mainting current 
levels, and 25.8% for intensi-
fying. The vote on campus went 
as tollows: 

Military Action: 
Withdrawal 
Reduction 
Maintain 
Increase 
All Out 
Bombing: 

381 
561 
48 
41 
94 

33.9% 
49.9% 
4.3% 
3.6% 
8.4% 

Cessation 612 54.8% 
Suspension 291 26.1 % 
Maintain 77 6.9% 
Intensify III 10.0% 
Nuclear 25 2.2% 
Whereas nationally 67.6% voted 
tor de-escalation (withdrawal or 
reduction) 83.8% voted for it at 
UCSD. 

Some interesting statistics 
were compiled from the national 
results. Among those who chose 
McCarthy, second and third place 
votes went to Kennedy and Rocke-
fe lIer, respectively. Kennedy 
voters chose McCarthy and Roc-
kefeller. Rockefeller and Reagan 
were runners-up among Nixon 
voters, with Nixon the over-
whelming second choice among 
Reagan voters. Suprisingly 
enough, Democrat Eugene Mc-
Carthy was the second choice 
of supporters of Republican Nel-
son Rocke fe ller. 

Another interesting study ana-
lyzed the stand s on the issues 
among the supporters of one 
presidential candidate. As was to 
be expected, 85% ofthe McCarthy 
supporters favored military 
withdrawal or reduction. How-
ever, the biggest vote for with-
drawal came from supporters of 
Martin Luther King (51.16%) and 
Fred Halstead (85.4%). 

56.1% of the Wallace voters 
urged an all-out effort as did 
50.1% of the Reagan voters, 35% 
of the Nixon voter s and 27.8% 
of the LBJ voters. Similar pat-
terns in th percentages were 
seen in the vote concerning bomb-
ing. 

An Interesting sidelight was the 
vote among foreign students 
(10,935 or 1 % of the total votes). 
Here RFK led with 36.4%. Mc-
Carthy was second with 27.9% 
and Nixon third with 11.0%.

Socialist, Capitalist Debate 
The topic for the dialogue 

scheduled for Wednesday night 
at the Lutheran Church was billed 
as "Capitalistic Free Enterprise 
and Marxism." However, the dis-
cussion that took place turned out 
to be more of a defense of a mild 
type of socialism on the part of 
Dr. Stanley Moore of Philosophy, 
and a fiexible-type of capitalism 
by Dr. Daniel Orr of Economics. 

Orr basically took the position 
that the capitaIlsltc society is 
functioning well, and does provide 
the most efrieient methOO for 
allocating resources. He warned 
that anyl'l'le who t'acommelld~ 
.lrastic overhaul of society runs 
the danger or doing more harm 
than good. 

Orr stated that the often stated 
maxim that In a capitalistic soci-
ety the rich grow richer and the 
poor poorer is a fallacy. He al~o 
claimed that suchasystem offers 
the greatest social mobility ot 
any, In which a low Income ~r­
son has considerable freedom 
to advance. 

Orr closed his opening re-
marks by stating that there are 
numerous other theoretical rea-
sons for favoring capltalls m as >l 
mode of organization. He quali-
fied this, however, by making It 
clear that the US today is not a 
completely tree ente rprise econ-
omy. 

Moore began by clarifying the 
meanings of capitalism ano soc-
ialism. He said that capitalism 
is a system In which the means 
of production are privately owned 
and inheritable. Some Uve solely 
off profit, rent, and interest, 
while others gain thetr income by 
working. 

In Soclallsm the means of pro-
duction are publicly owned and 
everyone who gains an income 
does so by working. Moore claim-
ed tbat Marxism is only one 
variety of socialism, just as 
Free Enterprise Is but one type 
at capitalism. 

Moore then presented Social-
ism as a more equitable means 

Students And 
Faculty Clash 

Saturday, 18 May, faculty and 
students will mount their donkeys 
and square off in what should 
prove to be an annual animal 
event. Sponsored by Alpha Phi 
Omega, the Donkey Basketball 
Game will raise funds for beaut-
ification and landscaping around 
the Coffee Hut. 

To help celebrate the Grand 
Opening of the Cluster I Gym-
nasium, the game has been sched-
uled to be held at the La Jolla 
Country Day School. There will 
be a bus leaving from in front 
of Urey Hall at 7:30 p.m. and 
from the student parking lot at 
Matthews at 7:40 p.m. with a 
return to UCSD immediately fol-
lowing the game. 

The faculty team features the 
following: 

Rod Burton (AMES), Siavouche 
Nemat-Nasser (AMES), Sheldon 
Schultz (Physics), George Masek 
(Physics), Frank Halpern (Phys-
ics), David Crowne (Literature), 
Piero Ariotti (Philosophy), Ed 
Peters (History), Bob Topolovac 
(Student Activities), Lynn Naibert 
(Financial Aids), and Ted Forbes 
(P.E.). 

The student team's winning 
formula depends on the following: 

Tom Shepard (AS), Renney Senn 
(Triton Times), Bob Conrad 
(KSDT), Jim Chapman (Muir 
R.A.), 8111 Reiner (Revelle R.A.), 
Gary Drean (Kappa Sigma Delta), 
Pat Hayes (Sigma Tau Epsilon), 
Guy Jenkins (Alpha Pb1 Omega), 
and Ray Tlee (Alpha Phi Omega). 

of satisfying the desires of the 
majority, but stated that social-
istic overhaul is not necessary. 
He advocated major economic re-
forms that will enable a democ-
racy to actually function in the 
Interests of the majority. 

In response to Orr's question 
of what such an economic over-
haul would consist of, Moore cited 
primarily the institution of a 
"tax system that isn't a fraud." 
Orr agreed that the present tax 
system is "mildly" inequitable, 
but disagreed strongly with 
Moore's attack on Inheritance or 
wealth. He said, "Suppose the 
thing I cherish most is my off-
spring. It is a direct abrogation 
of my rights to deny me giving

Kaprow Fence - In 
Creates New Tradition 

Alan Kaprow's ~tence-in" Hap-
pening at La Jo\1a Shores last 
Tuesday night has createdanoth-
er instant tradition at UCSD. 

Sponsored by the Visual Arts 
Department, the unusual event 
depended on typical UCSD initia-
tive and enthusiasm and a bit 
of egging on by the originator 
of the Happening. 

The idea of the Happening, 
according to Provost John stew-
art, who joined in thp. fun. is 
"doing som'lthing completely 
senseless and yet enjoyable We 
needed something like this to get 
us out of the 'uptight' feeling 
that's around the campus at this 
point in the quarter." 

"Something llke this" turned 
out to be four sets of 50-foot 
long wooden fence abOut 4 feet 
high. The object was to stretch 
the sections along the beach, 
starting at the south end of La 
Jolla Shores, and draw a chalk 
line in the sand along the fence. 
Every 200 feet, a flare and num-
ber card were set in the sand, 
while the students and partici-
pants carried their sections to 
the front of the line. 

woods of New England, but we 
had to cancel the event. It was 
natural to lay a fence in the sand 
here in La Jolla.-

The fence-in began at 8 p.m., 
when students and surious La 
Jollans began laying the fence on 
the beach. Tbere were partici-
pants from 4 years old up to 
grandmother stage. Among not-
able Happeners were the Muir 
Provost Stewart, Dean Allan Bat-
chelder, and AS President, Tom 
Shepard. 

Team member Bill Richkus couldn't win even with this whopper. 

At first observers were reiuc-
tant to join in the Happening, 
but once they picked up the fence, 
pounded in the stakes,pulled the 
Chalk line marker, and lit the 
flares, nothing stopped the ex-
citement. 

Kaprow, a bearded New Yorker 
in charge of the affair, said 
that he had never seen such en-
thusiasm as UCSD was showing. 

By midnight the group of be-
tween 200 and 300 had reached 
the cliff atthe north end of Scripps 
Beach. The fence-makers had 
splashed through the breaking 
waves since the tide had'almost 
reached the embankment. 

Fishing Tournament Won By

~If I had known that it would 
have been this successful, he 
said, "I would have tried some-
thing more challenging. Origin-
ally I wanted to do this in the 

Led by self-appointed leaders, 
up the cliff went a score of 
students, who handed hand tofoot 
the 4 sections of fence. At the 
top parking lot I Scripps, they 
marked number 26 flare and load-
ed the supplies back into the 
vans for the next Happe_ning.

3 and 4 as 15 anglers vied for 
honors in the surface fishlngpor-

of the Fourth Annual Inter-
collegiate PaCific Coast Deep Sea 
Fishing Tournament. UC LA 
UCSD, USC, UCSB, and the UC 
MedJcal School were the schools 
entered in the only intercollegi-
ate fishing tournament on the 
pacific coast which was he ld on 
the Coronado Islands. Teams 
consisted of three anglers and a 
coach. One point was awarded for 
each pound of fish with a 25% 
bonus for each yellowtail landed. 

It was a closely fought tourna-

ment with first, second and third 
positions changing by the hour. 
At the end of the first day USC 
was in first place with 60 points. 
UCSD narrowly held second with 
45 against UCSB with 38. On the 
second day fishing was dismal 
with the morning catch consist-
ing of only a few stray Bonita. 
Then it happened. At 11:30 Bill 
Richkus of UCSD hooked up with 
a Yellow and after a 20-minute 
battle landed the Yellow and put 
UCSD into first place. Unfortu-
nately for UCSD and Bill it was 
only the first of 13 Yellows to be 
landed in the next hour. After the 
sounds of screaming reels and 
the clunking of Yellows hitting 
the deck, the shouts of exhilera-
tion subsided and the final scores 

tallied UCLA had won the tourna-
ment with 148 points, squeezing 
out USC by a mere 12 poInts. A 
distant third was UCSD with 95. 
UCSB managed fourih with 88 and 
the Med School at the bottom of 
the sack with 45. The individual 
honors went to Tom Lund of USC 
who captured the Individual Tour-
nament Championship with 80 
points. Milt Love of Santa Bar-
bara and Russ Youngberg of UC 
Medical School shared the honors 
for the heaviest fish with a 
20 and 1/2 pound Yellowtail(bOth 
caught on 12 pound test lines).

UCLA Research Shows 
Lasting Effects Of LSD . 

Dr. William H. McGlothin, cur-
rently involved in research at 
UCLA dealing with long-term 
psychological effects of LSD 
spoke to UCSD students last week 
about LSD, Marijuana, and pres-
ent drug control pOlicies. Spon-
sored by the Guest-in-Residence 
Committee, Dr. McGlothin pre-
sented current research data on 
the effects of psychede lics and 
speculated as to future drug use 
in our society. 

Listing the effects of LSD, he 
reported that there is an immedi-
ate, .temporary suspension of the 
modes of perception without the 
clouding of one's consciousness. 
Also, there is frequently a tem-
porary psychosis, a depression, 
and existential despair which set 
in after drug use. There is oc-
casionally a failure to return to 
reality and a permanent psychot-
ic condition results. 

He then stated that the results 
of studies showing an increase in 
the number of chromosomal link-
age breaks of LSD users had not 
been repeated in subsequent stUd-
ies, More data is required for 
any conclusion to be made one 
way or the othe r. The only effect 
that has been established is a 
permanent alteration of the brain 
confirmed by comparative stud-' 
ies of people before and after 
they use LSD. 

Psychological changes were 
more apparent in subjects ' re-
ports than on psychology per-
sonality tes ts. As a result of 
taking LSD, individuals said they 
were less materialistic , less 
competitive, more selt-under-
standing, and more tolerant. 
Well-established was the fact 

that people who prefer organized 
and systematic lives s how less 
interest in using LSD, have less 
reaction to the drug, and have a 
s horter after-effect after their 
experience. Lik wise, peoplE1 who 
show greater interest in taking 
LSD, and who have more reaction 
and a longer after-effect, pre-

ferred a spontaneous, unsyste-
matic, and unstructured life. 

to heroine usage, as shown by the 
constancy of heroine arrests dur-
ing the increase in Marijuana 
arrests: 

Dr. Mc Glothin then attacked the 
inconSistency and the incongruIty 
of present drug laws. He cited 
the misdemeanor penalty for in-
cidents involving LSD as com-
pared to the felony charge ac-
companying marijuana arrests. 
He speculated that social changes 
might come when marijuana will 
be on the open market with a 
restriction on potency, age of 
purchase, and a taxation require-
ment. He concluded by noting 
that the Protestant ethic and the 
competitiveness of soc iey are 
changing. Pleasure is being ac-
cepted as pleasure, and more 
people have more leisure time. 
He said that it is time to update 
our social attitudes not only with 
regard to drugs but in all other 
aspects of society as weI!. 

Panel Questions Authenticity 
Of "The Passover Plot" 

A panel of three concluded 
Friday night that the arguments 
used by Dr. Schonfield in his 

bOok "The Passover Plot" did 
not present sufficient proof to 
declare t hat Jesus Christ was 
simply an ordinary man. The 
panel consisted of Dr. Jim Ken-
nedy of Salk Institute, Dr. Frank 
Young ot Scripps Clinic, and Dr. 
George Ladd of Fuller Theologi-
cal Seminary. The program was 
sponsored by the Triton Christian 
Fellowship. 

In "The Passover Plot", Dr. 
Schonlield presents Jesus as a 
very devoted young man who 
seriously studied the Old Testa-
ment. Jesus especially studied 
those sect ions of the Bible which 
dealt with the prophecy of a 
MeSSiah, and, eventually, he 
pieced together all the informa-
tion about the Messiah into a 
chronological chart. In his earn-
estness , Jesus came to believe 
that he was the true Messiah and 
plotted to have happen to 'him 
what was prophecied in the Old 
Testament. 

Hence, Schonfield claims that 
Jesus arranged to be crucified 
during the Passover, and had 
planned for someone to give him 
a drug just before he mounted 
the cross, to make him appear 
dead. However, the plan went 
awry when the Roman soldier 
thrust a sword into Christ'sbody 
to make certain he was dead. 
According to Schonfield Jesus 
died soon after he was t~ken off 
the cross; Jesus did not die on 
the cross. 

Schonfield's methodology inat-
tacking the divinity of Christ was 
to look at the evidence for the 
death and resurrection of Christ 
presented by the Christians and 

" If we had 
a Security Bank 

savings account, we 
could buy you 

some decent glasses." 

to explain this evidence in ration-
al terms. In this manner, the 
proposition of Christ being an 
ordinary man Is not proven but 
doubt is shown and the burd~n of 
proof is put upon the Christians. 

Dr. Kennedy was the first to 
speak, and was the one who 
dealt the severest blows to Dr. 
Schonlield 's arguments . The 
main area of criticism was 
Schonfield's presupposition that 
there is no supernatural; any 
evidence in the New Testament 
for the supernatural was com-
pletely disregarded. Kennedyas-
se rted that this assumption left 
no way to prove if there was 
something s upernatural or not. 
Also, Kennedy criticized Schon-
field's method of accepting evi-
dence from the Bible if it agreed 
with his thesis, but if it disputed 
his theSiS, he would either claim 
it was an error in the text, or 
he would completely ignore it, 
as he pointed out in several in-
stances . Dr. Kennedy concluded 
that Dr. Schonlield's method of 
argumentation was totally unac-
ceptable . 

Next, Dr. Young debated the 
medical question, did Christ die 
on the cross? First, Dr. Young 
explained the abus ive ways Christ 
was treated during the period be-
fore he was put on the cross. It 
is mentioned in Luke that Christ 
perspired blood; this is medi-
cally pOSSible, and is an indica-
tion of great mental s tress. Also, 
Christ s uffered great physical 
beatings just preceeding the car-
rying of the cross which lett his 
back a bloody pulp. This tremen-
dous loss of blood, along with the 
dis location of joints that occurs 
when someone is brutally mount-
ed on the cross, lead Dr. Young 

10 the conclusion that Christ must 
have died well before he was re-
moved [rom the cross. 

The historical aspect of 
Christ's death was discussed by 
Dr. Ladd. He asserted that God 
transcends history, and there-
fore is not recorded by man. 
Since God's will is not seen in 
history, it is impossible [or man 
to interpret it from a secular 
viewpoint. Therefore, Dr. Ladd 
charged that "The Passover 
Plot" was just "bad fiction.' 

As can be presumed from the 
organization that sponsored this 
program, the pane I cons isted en-
tirely of Christ ians and, conse-
quently, the criticism of Dr. 
Schonfield's book was ve ry one-
s ided. No one was present on 
the panel to defend Schonlield's 
agruments. Thus, the decision of 
the panel rendered a unani mous 
denunciation of his thesis.

Turning to Marijuana, McGlo-
thin cited the rapid increase in 
usage by middle-class youth. Ar-
rests involving pot numbered 
7000 in 1964 and 37,5000 in 1967 
(about 17% of all felony com-
plaints in California). If this 
rate continues, by 1969, over 
fifty per cent or the felony com-
plaints in Calilornla will involve 
Marijuana. He said that in s mall 
amounts, pot has the same ef-
fect as alcohol, while in larger 
quantities, its effects resemble 
LSD. There is no data suggesting 
physiological addiction to Mari-
juana, but psychological addiction 
is entirely possible. McGlothin 
hastened to add that some people 
are psychologically addicted to 
television. He also reported thaI

A.S. 'Senate Notes 
b, Roger Showle, 

McCarthy Sees 
As Challenge 

68 Campaign 
To America 

AS Senate action this week suggests problems for President Tom 
Shepard in the future. For the first time, he had to break a tie between 
the developing factions in Ute Senate on a minor amendment to a motion 
by Tom Baer. On one side, the three Muir Senators, Jon Collins, 
steve Greenberg and steve Ishmael, and Revelle Senator Paul Ricks 
were opposed by Tom Baer, Tom Peifer, JeU Benjamin, and Bill 
Eastman. As if to emphasize the widening rift, each faction sat op-
posite each other with Shepard at one end of the table and Deans Mur-
phy and Topolovac at the other. 

Besides the letter to the University community which Is covered 
on page 1 of teday's issue, other Issues brought up at the Wednesday 
meeting included the following: 

1. Off Campus Advertising: Bill Eastman reported that no specific 
rules exist to limit advertising in the community aud as long as con-
flicts do not develop, such advertising can continue. 

2. Curriculum review: Dr. Goodklnd, faculty representative to the 
Senate, asked the Senate to send representatives to a discussion on the 
Natural Science Sequence at Revelle College in order to obtain opinions 
from students. Jon Collins was appointed to head a committee from the 
Senate. 

3. Judicial Board: Next week Tom Shepard will begin Interviewing 
the nominations to the Board which Senate members recommended. 
other students Interested in serving on the Board a.re asked to call 
Shepard at ext. 1917 be'tween 9 and 12 o'clock any day or his home 
(755-4205) to make an appointment. The Senate must confirm his 
nominations before the J-Board can begin functioning. 

4. Symposium on the Draft: Dean Murphy described a 10-day 
series of special lectures and discussions which will be held on the 
draft within two weeks. The Triton Times will give further detailE 
next week when the schedule for the symposium has been finalized. 

5. Senior Class Gift: The Senate was asked, through Dean Murphy, 
to contribute $150 to the 150 seniors for their gift to the University. 
After much discussion about alternate sources of revenue, the AS 
decided to ask the seniors to approach the Revelle Vending Machine 
committee (which now operates through COS A) before the AS would 
consider aiding th.e original class of UCSD. 

6. Town Hall meeting: Bill Eastman suggested that a meeting of the 
entire student body be called to establish a special seat on the Senate 
for minorities. When objections were made concerning the nature of a 
.. minority", Eastman specl1ied the Black students on campus. Paul Ricks 
held that such a meetinl!: was out of the Question until proper rules of 
conduct could be formulated. Steve Greenberg asked how such a change 
in the constitution could be made since "aU groups could not be re-
garded as different from the AS." The motion was tabled until Ricks 
could come up with some operating rules. 

7. College Government: Again Muir College approached the Senate 
for funds, since it already owes more than $200 to the Provost's 
Office. Ken Pat ric , chairman of the Muir Provisional Government, 
reminded the Senate that it had $1500 earmarked for college government 
and that it should be appropriated before the end of the quarter. Jon 
Collins told the Senate that as soon as he could ascertain the exact 
amount of money that Muir s tudents now owe, he would report back 
to the Senate. Action was thus suspended until next week. 

Unfortunately, Tom Peifer refused to contribute an article to the 
Triton Times concerning his future plans as Senator. This newspaper 
will continue to urge the senators to be responsive to student interest, 

. but it can re~y on.ly the cooperation of the Senate. Perhaps some 
other senator will be willing to inform the student body of his plans 
for ne xt year. 

Residents 
On Suite 

Vote Today 
Membership 

The Interhall Council's pro-
posal for re-organizing the dorm 
structure met with some opposi-
tion from res ident students . At 
the Council's last meeting a group 
of students protested several 
parts of the proposal, with the re-
sult that a referendum was fin-
ally called for; voting will take 
place today among resident stu-
dents. 

According to the plan, no more 
than 6 returning students would 
be allowed )Elr suite. The dis-
senting studr nts claimoo that this 
would do aWf y with upper division 
halls, and .vould prevent 7-10 
students wt 0 wished to live in 

one suite from doing so. 

In order for ameasure to come 
to a vote, 10% of the resident 
students are required to sign a 
petition. With around 136 signa-
tures , more than enough were 
obtained. 

Several amendments to the 
original proposal were intro-
duced which would lessen the re-
quirements for next year, but they 
we re rejected by the council. 
It was decided that the plan wou ld 
be submitted to the students for 
their approval in its original 
form, rather than a watered-
down amended form.

Sellll.tor Eugene McCarthy, 
speaklng to several thousand of 
his supporters in BalbOa Park 
last Saturday, observed the 
"midpoint" in his campaign by 
reflecting upon what he has ac-
complished thus far. The signifi-
cance of his campaign, and oUbe 
68 election in general, be felt, 
Is that it represents a test of 
democracy and the political pro-
cess. 

"At the heart of what we were 
doing (when we started) was a 
genuine belief that there were 
certain issues which had to be 
taken to the people of this coun-
try for their consideration and 
judgment." 

McCarthy looked back upon the 
initial adverse reaction he had 
received. His effort was deemed 
desperate, futile, almost irres-
ponsible. It was said that to chal-
lenge government policy in a time 
of war is to move close to treason 
itself. 

However, McCarthy said that 
he has found the people ready and 
willing to seiZe the opportunity 
to be tested. He cited three 
changes that have been a result, 
directly or indirectly, of his 
candicacy. First of all LBJ is not 
a candidate for re-election -this 
announcement was met with con-
siderable applause from the audi-
ence. Secondly. the majority of 
Americans now favor an end to the 
Vietnam war. Finally, the nation 
has made a judgment of priori-
ties. 

In regard to the last point -
priority - McCarthy remarked 
"we have 15-20 million Negroes 
living under conditions of a kind 
of colonial domination or subjec-
tion." He stated that the only way 
this domillll.tion diUers from that 
of European countries in the past 
is that whereas they were ableto 
say, as in the case of Great 
Britain and India, "you are free ," 
we find that the subject people are 
living within us and it is not so 
easy to do so. 

This problem he termed the 
greatest challenge any nation has 
ever faced. However, McCarthy 
claimed that the US has the 
greatest potential to solve it 
than any other nation has ever 
had. "We will fail only by 
lack of will, by the lack of a 
moral committment." 

McCarthy, in an exclusive in-
terview with the TRITON TIMES, 
answered several questions con-
cerning foreign policy. He said 
that the basic way to avoid getting 
involved in the affiars of other 

No matter 

nations. such as those 01 LaUJI 
America, is to avoid giving mili-
tary aid of any kind. When asked 
specifically about his China pol-
icy, the senator replied that he 
favored recognition, but that the 
question of admittance to the UN 
was more involved, since two 
Clinas were invowved. 

McCarthy ended his speech 
with several comments on the 
office of the presidency itself. 
"This office , more than any oth-
er, belongs to the entire coun-
try." It warrants a man, he said, 
who is sensitive to the needs of 
the entire country. Referring 
presumably to RFK, his chief 
opponent in California, he said 
that money can advance the 
cause." He added, however that 
his campaign will be adequately 
financed in California. 

"There will be no alte mpt to 
package me or sell an image. A 
candidate must have as much 
respect for the process by which 
he is elected as he has for the 
office Itse If.'' 

McCarthy summed up the is-
sues of the 68 campaign, by 
stating that the referendum is 
not just one limited to the Viet-
nam War . "I am calling upon 
you to pass judgment on a kindo! 
militarization of American for-
eign policy, if not American life 
itselt." 

"1968 is an important year 
for participation in politics. lf 
we do our part now the world of 
1984 will be Quite different from 
what some people said it will be 
like."

Aid Refused To 
Demonstrators 

WASHINGTON - The House 
voted to refuse federal financial 
support to any student who takes 
part in a campus uprising that 
disrupts a college's operations. 

It included the ban in a bill 
that would extend for two more 
years a $1 billion package of 
student aid programs that now 
reach about 1.5 million students, 
about 25 per cent of the total 
college enrollment. 

The House also adopted amend-
ments that would deny any of the 
funds to students convicted of 
crimes arising out of college de-
monstrations or of inciting or 
tak ing part in a riot. 

The decision as to whether a 
student has been involved in a 
campus demonstration would be 
left to the college authorities un-
der the provision. 

With frequent references to the 
uprisings that shut down Colum-
bia University and have swept 
campuses across the nation, the 
House members overwhelmingly 
approved the privision by a 306-
54 roll call vote. Final passage 
then came on a 348 to 5 vote.

Guess what? The gym still 
ain't ready, so the planned events 
for this weekend have to seek 
other, less extravagant quarters. 
Cal Tjader and his crew w111 use 
the cafeteria for their concert 
this evening, and the Donkey Bas-
ketball game between the faculty 
and students is scheduled for the 
La Jolla Country Day Gym. Ah 
well, the best laid plans, etc. etc. 

The year is rapidly drawing to 
a close, and most of the inter-
collegiate teams have called it 
quits . Track is the lone sport 
in competition, but there are a 
few teams preparing for next 
fall. Most prominent is football 
and Coach Hackett's crowd ha~ 
been working outlor three weeks. 
This reporter can speak with 
knowledge when he says that 
footbal1 practice is no easy deal. 
1'm gamely fighting away on the 
gridiron; God knows when I break 
a leg. 

Intercollegiate soccer shares 
the practice field with the football 
squad as they prepare for their 
initial venture into regular com-
petition. Fred Grunewald has the 
feature on that.

The UCSD Golf team easily 
defeated the University of San 
Diego 38-16 on the Lomas Santa 
Fe Golf course last Friday. Me-

dalist honors went to Darrel 
Cohen who scored a sizzling 75 
on the 6,000 yard championship 
COurse. This final mat.ch of the 
season gave UCSD eight victor-
ies and se ven defeats for the 
year . . 

Gymnastics has begun opera-
tions, or at least an introduction 
into the various facets of the 
sport. Much more can be ac-
complished once the gym is fin-
ished, and equipment moved in. 

And speaking of the gym again, 
it was wonderful planning on the 
part of the University regarding 
the finish on the playing floor. 
It seems that a varnish was chos-
en that takes up to 3 week s to 
dry; starting on the floor this 
week just doesn't appear to leave 
much time for it to dry by to-
nig~t . Sorry, guys, you blew it 
agalll!

Best of luck to UCSD's con-
tingent to the UC Intramural Day 
this weekend. 40 people from 
campus will accompany Coach 
Gary Schiller to vie with teams

will be attempted next week, but 
don't hold me to it!

'fritons Excell In Riverside 
Track Meet Invitational 

"We came; we rani we won!" 
That was the saying at Riverside 
last Saturday as the Triton thin-
clads again showed I.heir suueri-
orlty in the Annnal UC RIver-
side Invttational Track Meet. 
Atter a magnificent performance 
last year which brought the Tri-
tons a total of 28 trophys, the 
team's showing was just as good 
even though the amount was only 
20 this time. 

This was due to 
the elimination of two relays 
which were run last year. 

Upon arriving at Riverside for 
the meet it was a pleasure to 
find that the hundred mBe an 
hour bree~e that pla~led last 
yqar's races was ot present, 
Yf!t ! Also the temperature was 
in the mild 70' s instead of the 
not so mild 95 from las t year. 
This wa3 just perfect for a team 
that was rt!ady to rip. 

Since the meet was run on 
the same schedule as a normal 
dual contest, the first event was 
the 440 relay. With normal con-
fusion due to entries not re-
ceived or lost, the original race 
of three teams was extended to 
two races of seven teams. in the 
second race UCSD entered two 
teams, the first composed of 
steve Garfolo, Joe McCarthy, 
Tom Wolfe, and Dav9 Kubn who 
placed second in the blistering 
time of 43.7 seconds tor a new 
school record. The other team 
had a little (?) bad luck as the 
hand off between the 3rd and 
4th men resulted ina near co-

llision. Biola College, it seems 
has not taught their runners to 
count too good, as their anchor 
man was supposed to be in lane 
6 with UCSD team 2 in lane 7. 
To make a long story short, when 
Marc Rothman came around the 
curve to hand off to Jerry Nier-
engarten, there was no Nieren-
garten in lane 7, but instead a 
red jersied Biola runner who 
paniced at the sight of a stranger 
charging at him at full steam. 
In the process of handing off the 
baton to Jerry, Marc tound him-
self rolling down the track pass-
ing up many of the opposing run-
ners. He was slightly stiff to say 
the least, which showed up later 
when he ran the quarter mile and 
crossed the finish line in knots. 

In the century (LOO ydddsh) the 
trio of WOlfe, Kuhn, and McCarthy 
somehow managed to wind- up in 
the same heat. When the race was 
over and examined on the video-
tape, places were awarded to 
Wolle and McCarthy. To many on 
the track and elsewhere it looked 
like Kuhn had been right up in 
the thick of it, but the consensus 
was that he was just too small 
to be seen on the screen of the 
video-playback device. The story 
changed later in the 220 yd dash 
when Kuhn burst away from tbp. 
pack in a blinding flash of speed 
to win his heat of the day. in 
second place was good old Wolfe. 

Jerry Nierengarten came hack 
in the 120 high hurdles to grab 
a place, in a race that amazed 
everyone. Jerry who ~ normally

a slow s tarter, got an ama:t.1l15 
start as lead the pack over the 
barriers untU halfway down the 
track. By the way, the hurdles 
are almost as big as Jerry 
Nie rengarten also placed in the 
long jump. 

The distance crew of Kumley, 
Nash, Naumann, and Segal did 
a great job Saturday even though 
only two ofthem received awards. 
Warren Kumley ran a magnifi-
cent 3000 meter steeplechase 
eclipSing the old school record 
set by him last year. The time 
of 10:03 was four seconds faster. 
Warr en seemed to live up to 
his nick name though, as Kum -
lately missed third by less than 
an inch. Pete Naumann showed 
his form in the 880, along with 
mate Nash, and managed to coas t 
his way into a third place trophy. 
Kumley came back to run the 
880 and again missed that elu-
sive third place by just inches' 
he was just too tired after hi~ 
othe r race, as he missed this 
school record by a few tenths 
of a second. Jay Segal, running 
with an injured heel still managed 
to break ten minutes in the 2 
mile run for a third place. Jay 
was wearing his little brother's 
track s hoes. 

The field events added their 
share of the trophys to the count 
as Knowles placed in both h~ 
high jump and long jump classes. 
Roy Dimon (listed as Simon in 
the meet program --- half of the 
discus duet of Simon and Garrolo) 
placed in the discus with his 
mil!;hty effort of the day (123'). 
Pole vaulter, Don Br ight de-

fending his win from last y~ar's 
meet, again placed high as he 
cleared 12'6". In another divi-
sion vaulters Jim Dent and Bruce 
Burdick again vaulted 13 feet 
and tied tor third.
