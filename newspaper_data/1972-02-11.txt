Marijuana referendum urged 

Efforts have heen announced to place an initiative on the 
June 6 Calif ofilia ballot to legalize the personal use of 
marijuana . The California Marijuana Initiative would remove 
all criminal penalties for the use and possession of marijuana 
by persons over the age of 18. 

The initiative's sponsors need to obtain the signatures of 
330,000 California voters during the next 90 days in order to 
qualify for a ballot spot. The proposed law reads : 

•• 0 person in the State of California . 18 years of age or 
ol~e~. shall be punished criminally, or be denied any right or 
prlVllege, by reason of such person's planting. cultivating. 
harvesting. drying, processing. otherwise preparing, 
transporting. or possessing marijuana for personal use. or by 
reason of that use. " 

In urging the legalization of marijuana the initiative 
sponsors contend that there is no proof that the drug is any 
more harmful than alcohol. One of the principal effects of the 
criminal sanctions on marijuana is the criminalization of a 
large proportion of the population, according to the the reform 
backers. 

Proponents of the measure contend that the millions of 
dollars, and manpower, used to prosecute marijuana offenders 
could be used to fight crimes of violence. 

The Initiative would not affect laws agaInst the sale of the 
drug . The arne criminal sanctions applted to dnving under the 
Influence of alcohol would apply to marijuana usage The 
petition backers have opened an office in San Diego at 721 
Devon Ct and may be contacted by calling 488·8014 or 488·7877.

The Scything of Kevin Olson 
By David Kri toffer on 

There exists an interesting quotation in a book 
that is rarely read today, However since Kevin 
Olson is an intellectual by his own admission it 
surprises me that he wasn 't aware ot it when 'he 
composed his invective against Women 's 
Liberation, The quotation is the following : 
"Whatsoever a maD soweth, that shall he also 
reap ," Although February Isn't normally 
considered harvest time. Olson seems to be 
prematurely ripe, 

Our dear friend must be a very unhappy 
person since he seems to have an obseSSIOn for 
slandering others, Witness the follOWing 
excerpts from his article on Women 's 
Liberation : "What looks like a cross between a 
faggot and a lesbian gets up on the stage ,., "; 
and then a description of "a distinguished. 
looking lady whose major Intellectual 
revelatIOn to us is 'Oh, wow! ' " What's the 
maller Kevin? Did your mamma beat you when 
you were htUe? 

Kevin then proceeds to confess his other 
obsession, sex. There 's little wonder that he 
distorts the issue at hand . He was too busy 
eyeballing Gloria's bod to listen to what she had 
to say , Instead of wfl tmg articles to mislead 
people, he should h(' writing porno books, 

'ThiS is not to say that I personally agreed with 
Glofla on every pomt she made. However , 
Olson takes a distorted selection of facts and 
then proceeds to brush off all of Women 's Lib as 
an illegitimate movement. 

Victorian Women Were Subjugated 
He contends that women in Victorian England 

were "exalted to the highest ideal of romantic 
love." which supposedly shows that they were 
free after haVing been "marketable sla~es" in 
primitive society He conveni ently forgets that 
this exalted status stili subjugated women to an 
idle sub·huma n life of va nity and empty. 
headed ness . Women in Victorian England never 
had a chance to develop as complete human 
beings, They were trained from childhood to act 
out their pflm and proper roles, 

After some remarks on racism I his quota lion 
of Bobby Seale was about the only valid point in 
his entire article) and more slanderous 
remarks about the audience (of which he was 
part) , he summarizes Gloria as saying that it 
logically follows from past hi story that the next 
five thousa nd vears Will cons ist of " total 
humanism " I believe that Glofla was onlv 
stating her hopes and goals. i.e , since woman 
was exalted for the first five thousand vears . 
and subjected for the second fi ve thousand 
vears, It would round out the picture If the next 
five thousand years consisted of humanislic or 

equal relations between the sexes, I don 't think 
she was saying that there is any logical 
necessi ty in history whatsoever, If she did 
believe that this was the case, as Olson 
contends, then why should she be fighting for 
Women's Lib? If Olson 's lack of reasoning is 
correct . she could just sit back and let the 
inevitable happen. 

Olson never once came to grips in hi s article 
with the problem of sex discrimination, He 
undoubtedly attended the meeting with the 
premeditated idea of destroying Women 's Lib 
because it attempts to take woman out of her 
" traditional" role and therefore runs counter to 
his stagnated gestalt. 

Extremes Injurious 10 Progress 
Conservatives in general are afraid to admit 

that progress means a break with the 
" traditional, " sometimes, Progress is an action 
that causes mental anguish to many people who 
aren 't up to living on the brink of change. They 
protect themselves by becoming conservatives. 

The other extreme, which IS just as injunous 
to progress as conservatism. is radicalism . 
These people. In their distaste for the past and 
fanatic eagerness for change. tend to destroy 
the societal heritage completely . They do root 
out social injustices sometimes. but In the 
process they destroy the good that society has 
accompli shed, and only end up by establishing a 
set of new injustices 

Aflstotle 's concept of the golden mean can be 
frui tfully applied to this social si tuation, First it 

In~o!ves understanding society by studying its 
ongms and development. When understanding 
is achieved, then we can look at the past, 
present and future of society as an orga nic 
whole, We rationally build in the present, on the 
good of the past. while looking forward to our 
future goals. At the same time, we rationally 
attempt to root out the Injustices of the pa t. it 
requires a level head and a lot of uncommon 
common sense to mainta in this rationalistic 
liberalism and to prevent ourselves from falling 
off into the abysses of the extremes. But. never 
fear , such a ph ilosophy of life should be the end 
product of the liberal education which I hope we 
are all receiving at UCSD , 

Upon wnting this I conclude that. (I) Kevin 
Olson " is hopeless, and of no intellectual 
consequence, " Ito use hiS own words) ; (2) If he 
is a pnme example of cons rvallsm. then that 
movement can damage our socletv because 131 
it produces people who, In their attempts to 
refute Ideas that are opposed to theirs, mislead 
others, pr ad alarm and distort th truth ,

"natural " lead in the quotation the reporter used to end his 
first paragraph (" Women 's Liberation is not reform, but 
revolution. and nothing can stop it"). and it would have been 
more consistent and true to the meaning of Steinem's 
appearance. 

Attempt at Objectivity? 
Another example of the reporter's failure to hide his 

personal views was the lead sentence of his second paragraph, 
Here Olson subordinates Steinem's political entity ( .... ,a 
leading political fort:e in the femini st movemenL") to her 
physical appearance, which as he stated in hi s opinion article is 
all he is willing to give her credit for , Olson is entitled to his 
opinions, but any attempt at objectivity would have expressed 
the fact that in the context of her appearance at UCSD Gloria 
Steinem is first of all "a leading political force ," 

However. the most blatant manner in which Olson cheated 
the TT reading public with his inability to disregard his 
political bias is brought out in the last paragraph of his 
admittedly opinion article . He there confesses that he did not 
bother to remain for Gloria Steinem's post-speech meetmgs 
with UCSD chicanas and black women. As the reporter 
ostensibly covering the event. he had a responsibility to do so 
despite what he felt. If he had , his news article could have 
commented on a discrepancey between a major point of 
Steinem's speech and reality, And his opinion article might 
have taken the form of a real criticism of Women's Liberation 
instead of the feeble effort to disguise hiS politics and 
chauvinism behind what he obviously thought were 
intellectually sounding six·bit words and phrases 

Anotber Deficiency 
In her speech Steinem declared that they had it over the 

male-dominated groups within the Movement because women 
were "all together ," If Olson had attended the meetings, 
especia lly those With individual black women, he would have 
observed that thi s i a myth , The number one task of the 
Movement has been and still is " gettmg it together," Many 
blacks and chicanos, both men and women. are unable to dispel 
their suspicions about the depth and extent of the white 
commitment. chicanos and chicanas are wary of going into 
joint meetings with blacks, and vice-versa (a wariness induced 
by many years of struggle among themselves over the crumbs 
thrown by the dominant white society ). No sweeping statement 
by Gloria Steinem IS going to dispel this reality, 

It may be that the Movement ca n get together only If it 
accepts the fact there may be irreconciliable differences 
among the varied groups. Having done so. it will be necessary 
to si ngle them out. identify them as such, and declare a 
temporary status quo with respect to them , Only then can the 
Movement move forward on its many common fronts agamst 
the oppressive forces in ou r society, without the catalyst of a 
Jackson Stale or Angela Davi.l; trial 

In conclusion, part of thi article may have appeared to be a 
personal attack on Kevin 01 on, It was not meant to be such 
He has simply expressed his reactionary politica l views - the 
fault lies with a news department which fail s to weed them out 
and sends him to cover this type of story in the first place 

two reactions becau e I see the 
two responses not merely as 
contrasting responses of two 
indiViduals, but ' as 
exemplifications of the two 
basic responses of men In 
general to the issue raised by 
the women 's liberati on 
movement. David takes this 
issue seriously; Kevin does not. 
If anything. the " equal time" 
juxtaposition offered by the TT 
probably gives a greater 
empha sis to a se ri ous 
consideration of the goals of 
the movement th an is 
paralleled by the attitudes of 
men in society at large. I 
regretfully admit that to 
believe that approximately half 
of the men in this society 
respond seriously to the 
women 's liberation movement 
woul.d be to be extremely 
optimistic 

Kevin summarizes Gloria 's 
presentation With the ,word 
" For about a half·hour she 
rambles on, from sexism to 

racism, back to sexism, over to 
humanism - all the necessary 
leftist cliches" Perhaps, 
Kevin , hl/lllanism (or lack of 
it ) does have relationship to the 
problems of sexism and 
racism , Perhaps, for some of 
us . "humanism" IS more than a 
cliche. Sincerely. 

Alice Little 
Ignorance 

Editor : 
I am convinced that Kevi n 

Olson knows much less of the 
women 's or Black liberation 
movements than he claims , It 
was not Bobby Seale but 
Stokely Carmichael, now more 
or less an inactive force of the 
Black movement, who said way 
back in 1966: "The only 
position for women in SNCC is 
prone ,' ( as quoted in 
Sisterhood is Powerful, edited 
by Robin Morgan which I 
recommend to Mr. Olson to 
read),

Last weekend the UCSD tennis learn journeyed to their first 
meets of the season. and a truly rigorous test was chosen. This 
was the event known as the AIl·Cal tennis match held at 
Riverside. UCSD showed significant improvement over last 
year. finishing fifth {Instead of laslI.behind IrvlOe. Berkeley . 
Davis. and Santa Barbara . and gettlOg 13 match POints (versus 
only two last year I in defeating Riverside and Santa Cruz. 

Ah ~ improvement. That will be the byword of the team this 
vear The theory IS that no matter how bad a year the team has 
thiS year. It has to be better than last year, w'hen the team won 
only two matches. ThiS year coach Tad Yamaguchi expects his 
netmen to finish with at least a .500 record if not better. 

The team consists of a conglomeration of returmng 
lettermen. older players and a relatively vast amount of 
freshmen The lettermen includes such stellar performers as 
Ted Teacher. Dick Davis and Bruce Baxley. However. it 
appears that the team has suffered Its first major misfortune 
of the season . Ted Teacher . along with potential young star 
Skip Schlnk. are both going to be gone for a long period of time 
due to that dreaded di ea e. mononucleosis. 

The old men Include. among others. a transfer from USC. 
Rudy Perkins. He will become eligible next quarter and is 
expected to become number·one man. Rounding out the old 
men of the varsity are Charles Buman. a popular senior. Rick 
Doroskl and Tim Luey. both sophomores. 

The bright spot of the team. however. rests with the 
freshmen tenms bums such as Scott Rath . Bruce Wakefield. 
Bruce Burnett. Bill Duke and Richard Freer. These players 
are expected to gain valuable plaYing experience this year and 
With this large a crop of good players there Will be no problem 
concerning injuries. 

Thus. thiS year Will be a year of bUilding and improvement.

Teams scramble for playoffs 
Pat Stacy 

There 's been plenty written abou t the battle for first place in 
the Cursed League twixt EBONY. the SQUAWS and the 
STREET GANG . One might tend to think the action in the 
other nine men·s. coed. and pee-wee leagues was j ust after·the-
fact. This is far from reality . however . as many teams are still 
scrambling for their league's lead and /or a spot in the playoffs. 

5'10" and under action (which seems to be more like 5'11 " or 
6' and under) is split into two leagues. imaginatively named 
Pee Wee I and I I. Riding tall in short league I action is 
undefeated LESSER OME TUM at 4·0 who have the league's 
top scorer in Boyer. averaging 17.5 points per game. Still with 
a good shot at the lead are Carlos Robles and CHAPARRO and 
the disorderlY ORDER ON THE COURT. 

The tough 'Pee Wee II finds no one able to knock off OFF 
often ( In fact. not at all . so far I Youngblood !the Red Streak I 
combines With long bomber Tom Wright and others to form a 
well ·balanced . well·playing ball club. QUINTO BOTO and the 
big men of ARGO V are still in the race for the lead . a lead that 
OFF seems reluctant to relinquish . 

Sitting atop the Bonk League is CARNAL IGNORA CE and 
wonder woman Elaine Simay. who scored 31 points in leading 
her team to a come·from·behind 50·49 thriller over 
PSYCHOLOG Y The PSYCHES. who got fine games from long 
Linda La Bounty 119 1 and speedy Kris Hooper 118 1. had 
preVIOusly clipped the wings of the YUBA CITY GOOSERS by 
a core of 38·34. as the GEESE seemed unable to fire up until it 
was too late. The GOOSERS and the CARNAL DUM·DUMs 
mixed it up last RIght in a game too late for this edition. 

Tuff Dart cum petition is being dominated by the HOT LIPS . 
who look to be unstoppable (at least in their league ). 
Meanwhile. in Kroogel play. the VEE 8's got another fine 
performance from Helen Petrovich. who has seemingly come 
from nowhere to become a star of coed basketball. as they 
propelled themselves into a first place tie with the MOVERS 
by knocking off the MUONS. 45·32. The MUONS. obviously 
miSSing their supershooter Cheryl Elliot (rumored to be 
discussing contract terms in L .A. with the Lakers ) must 
overcome big Terry Rippier and the MOVERS in order to have 
any hope of reaching the playoffs .

Rugby team drop kicks 
their way past Cal Tech 

Again last weekend the 
UCSD rugby team added 
another Win to Its r ecord . in a 
gam of many surprises. as 
they butted their way past Cal 
Tech 12 to 8. It wa s a good day 
for rugby - the weather was 
cool. and everyone was still 
hungover from Mlc 's party . 

The game started rather 
slowely when Peter Dragustm 
Sertic van Jezerane 
encountered a wall of Ca l Tech 
ruggers . Just when it looked 
like curtains for our hero from 
the old country {or the old hero 
from our country I. he drop· 
kicked the ball through the 
upflghts while on the run to 
give us an earl.v 3·0 lead. Soon 
after thiS we were awarded a 
seri es of penalty kicks . and 
Scott Young boomed a low 
dflving kick 40 yards to make 
the score 6·0 Before halftime 
could give us a needed 
breather . a

runner broke through for a try. 
as four UCSD ruggers got their 

~Ignal s mixed up (they couldn 't 
decide who should have the 
privilege of tackling him I. 

With a slim lead. 6·4 . UCSD 
pressed hard for a score ea rly 
in the second half. The score 
came again from von J€Zerane 
on an easy penalty kick . With 
the score now 9·4 and only 30 
minutes left. ou r ruggers were 
getting a bit disgusted with the 
officiating . After a somewhat 
questionable ca ll by the 
officials the core stood at 9·8. 

The game was far from over 
as the versatile Dickie Duncan 
received a pass from Peter 
Sertlc at midfield Duncan took 
two steps and boomed a 45·yard 
drop kick . It looked more like a 
punt and as it eaSily cleared the 
uprights, the UCSD team stood 
dumbfounded . This only proves 
that Dickie Duncan is a bi 

threat than anyone imagined. 
With the score now 12·8, UCSD 
lasted out the clock despite 
more bad calls and attempts by 
Cal Tec h to score. 

Then the UCSD second team. 
inspired bV this win and with a 
new ref. came on the field and 
downed Indian RC 18·10. This 
game proved as exciting and 
surprising as the first. as 
James " Sally " Salery returned 
to the Ime·up after being 
sidelmed ea rly in the season 
with a knee injury. The star of 
the game had to be little Dick 
Ostrup. as he proved that he is 
worthy of a fir t team position 
by stopping almost every drive 
indian RC could muster. 
Through the entire game 
Ostrup was seen kicking heads 
and even rugby balls. Another 
rugger . " Sloe·gin " Jerry. had 
himself a similar terrifIc 
game. Cont . on Pg. 7

from

you 've got now is falling 

gOlOg to fInd out what an apartment shou ld 
really be like .. like fu lly built-In kitchens. 
terri fic bedrooms. carpeting . drapes. and a 
private patio outside your door. And, perhaps 
best of all . all of this is less than five minutes 
from campus 

I@ 

apart at the beams If you have to listen to 
that tap dancing clown upstairs for one more 
night, you 're gOing 10 knock him for a coup le 

of fruit loops. Is that what's troubllOg you. Bunky? 
WELL, STEP RIGHT UP SON, GET YOURSELF 

A ROOMMATE AND RENT YOURSELF A LITTLE 
PEACE OF MIND AT LA JOLLA VILLAGE. 

Look at it this way: If you and a fr iend go in on a 
place. it'll cost you as httle as $ 7250 a month. 
The money you 're paying for the dive you 're 

liVing in now can buy you a little more 
happiness and a whole lot more 

comfort and convenience. 
It's the htlle th ings. Like two huge swimming poo ls. 

Or. maybe you 'd like to lie around In the JacuZZI 
until you r body turns to Jelly It might even be a fnendly 

game of pool In the bilhard s room ... for pink sl ips. 
And when you hnd your way to your apartment 

after an evenIng In the fireS ide lounge. you 're 

'_can 
liVe 
as Cheaply 
as 
one. 

So you see, two real ly can live as cheaply 
and as extravagantly as one . and after all . 
aren 't two heads better than one?
