The Spirit of 
Christtnas Past 

Once again, it is time to complain. It is time to 
gape in astonished disgust, hit our foreheads 
and say, "I swear by everything sacred that it 
gets earlier every year." And, indeed, it does. 
The Christmas holidays have now been moved 
up, by our earliest reckoning, to ept. 30. 

Last year, we noticed Christmas holiday 
decoration beginning to supercede Halloween 
by about four days. This was cause for sighs of 
regret and recollection of year past 
"Remember when Thanksgiving preceded 
Christmas, and the stores decently waited 
until the Friday after Turkey Day to throw up 
(should I say vomit) the red, white and green 
decorations ?" 

The progression in the past has always been 
s low, or rather, slower. A day or two 
advancement each year, at the most. Just 
enough to cause a mild stir, a mere whisper of 
discontent among the consumers. The whisper 
was always buried as the holiday image-
mortars screamed overhead, bursting in red, 
white and green fury. 'Well,' we all said, 'with a 
couple of extra days, maybe we can beat the 
season rush, right?' 

This year, though, the opening day ha taken 
a quantum leap forward. The advertis ing and 
retail combine has aimed a double barreled 
shotgun at Thanksgiving and Halloween, 
winging them and leaving them to float on the 
murky waters of semi-marketability. Cool 
calculation has been demonstrated in this bold, 
risky move. 

Then again, what do they (should it be They?) 
stand to lose? By giving up a bit of floor space to 
a wonderful assortment of shining vinyl 
"trees," rimmed with electronic golden tin el 
and deflatable round, red ornaments, or 
hanging a few posters of Santa Claus on the 
wall, the stores at worst will sell nothing. They 
can't lose. 

Of course, we know that selling nothing is a 
dream. These products will sell. They are 
selling already. Those retailers with some 
honor, piously holding out until Halloween, are 
probably losing money at this very instant. 
Christmas is big business, and, as the No-on-
Prop.-ll crowd likes to say, "it just doe n't 
make sense" to re trict Christmas sales to only 
a week or a month. 

What? Excuse me? There is a voice in the 
wilderness yelling something about ... what is 
it? ... ah, yes, peace on Earth. But let's not be 
ridiculous here. This editorial is dealing with 
reality. Editorials about the "true meaning" of 
Christmas went out of fashion with s hort hair 
and pink alligator s hirts years ago. 

Face it. In the wealth of prizes, pre~ents and 
purchasing, in the sparkling jangle of 
marketable delights, who in the world is going 
to want to think about peace, love and honor? 

anta Claus doesn't s tand for goodwill and 
understanding anymore. He s tands for good 
and bad kids, free candy canes, a gift lis t and a 
photo for which Mommy makes us comb our 
hair. 

Sure, we regret the passing of profound 
meanin~. It 's a damned shame.

No student representation 
on UC Board of Regents? 
By PETER MORTEN EN 
When Glenn Campbell. 

chairman of the LIC Hoard of 
Regents . announced tl\O 
weeks ago that the committee 
to select a replact'ment for 
retiring lIC President Dalid 
,axon would consIst of onl} 
regen t s. mort' than (1 fell 
e~' ebro\\'s "ere raised tn anger 
and disappotnt ment. 

Leonard "Chip" S( hmidl. 
president o( t he PC St udent 
Bo(h President-. COUIlCti. was 
~aid' 10 hal'e been UP"l't 
hccausl' the "tradition" o(

ago) had been \ tOlaled. 
Represenl at II es (or I he I 'C 
Student Lobb\ tn Sacramento 
\01crd opp<)sil'ion (or much the 
same reason. And St udent 
Regent Ltnda abo reportedly 
Iv as none too pleased hen,el f. 
having been passed over 
hersel( (or membership on the 
committee. 

Their disappointment is 
understandable and shou ld be 
shared by all ~ludents. 

The issue IS a complex and 
sensitIve one. Traditionally, 
the l'C systemwide admini, 
st rat Ion and t he regents have 
been cool to student input on 
matters t hat directly relate to 
students; they are downright 
cold to student suggestions on 
matters that have only a 
marginal effect on them. 

But even in thi s less-than-
fri endly at mosphere, there do 
exist several avenues (or 
student input in the UC 
deClsion·making process . 
Campbell's choice not to 
include any students on the 
committee (or faculty or staff, 
(or t hat matter) was balanced 
by his promise that these 
a\enue~ wou ld be tapped for 
comment and review at the 
appropriate time during the 
search process.

as well as many ot hers - IS

feeling isolated and left out.

Pa t Burke. one of I he 

interns. sees UCSD a~ moreof 
a "commumty, as opposed to a 
learning In~ttluti on." He 
wants the center 10 serve as a 
base for commulers to gel 
involved with Ihe UCSD 
communil Y. "A commuler 
advisory board brainstorms 
ideas , but commu ter input is 
always welcome." 

Third College operates a 

lou nge "1m liar to Revelle's, 
from 8 a.m. to II p.m., located 
under the cafeteria. 

Third\ lounge is smaller 
and is nOI s t affed with interns,

Life in the slow lane at the UCSD bookstore 
By JOHN ROSEN 

A number uf days ago. \\ hile 
I held posi t ion 6~ in line at the 
Central Cashier, pat Iently 
awaitmg any sign of forward 
progression. I gre\\ annoyed at 
t he hairy s tranger m front of 
me holding POS It ion 61. He 
\"'ore a rather large knapsack 
crammed full of God knn\,,'s 
what, although I do recall 
catching a glimpse of a 
medium-sized lunar globe. and 
a dist inctly fi shy odor. I 
confirmed the odor as "old" 
and fi hy when he took a few 
teps back, knocking me into 

po ition number 63. 
"Uh. excu e me," r managed 

to mumble through the flap of 
hi s pack. 

He turned. a bit confused as 
to the disturbance. and finall y 
fo und me. 

"Yeah?" he acknowledged . 
" I thought . perchance. you 

might remove your backpack. 
as it seems to be interfering 
wit h my respiratory func· 
tion..,. " 

At this he curled his brow. 
scratched his beard. and 
engaged in deep. meaningful 
thought. 

"Let me get this straIght," 
he said after a long moment 
"Is my pack stickin' m you 
face. is that \\ hat thIS is all 
about'" 

I e\posed my broade~t smile 
to mn firm t hat he had a 

hea It hy grasp of t he SIt uat Ion. 
" ) wonder. wou ld it be too 

much effon (or you 10 place 
your knapsack elsewehere? 
Every new breat h I take kills 
t en brain cells." 

"Brain cells. hu h?" he as ked 
skept ica ll y. " Wh al , you a 
student or something?" 

"A student . yes, very good. " 
" Hey. that's gr at! " He took 

off his pack and placed it on the 
ground next to us. ' 'I'm 
pretending to be a student 
myself while I'm here on 

• ... She wore leopard 
skins. We don'l have 
leopards ill Oregon ... ' 

campus, 
" Pr e t en d in g to be a 

s lUdent ?" I asked him. " I don't 
qu ite follow." 

"Well , take. for instance. 
yesterday," he began. " I-Ia\ tng 
just hitched in from my 
commune in Oregon. 1 took a 
hike back and forth across 
campus four or fi\ e tImes and 
got about as much an'om· 
plished as e\ ery ot her new 
st uden t did." 

"Yeah," I agreed. "I only 
managed to get in around two 
tnps befon' calltng it qUlls." 

"Then al nIght I \\ent to ont' 

01 the cafeterias lor (li nner," 
he gnm'lCl'd. "but I cou ldn't 
set' m~'se l f eat mg I hat st u fl'. '-;0 
r ended lip cookin' my 0 \\ n on 
my hut plat e." 

"You cooked \ ou 0\\ n meal 
Inside a un in'r,,'ltv cafeten a?" 

"Well. not for too long." Ill' 
looked pen u rbed. " Th ey 
kicked me out n ght quick." 

" I s up pose th e fire 
d e part m e nt ha s s ome 
regulations or something 
restricitng that sort of thing, 
right ?" 

"Maybe." he conceded, "but 
they said I was iphoning off 
too much bu ine s." 

"Life's hard ," r said , hoping 
more than ever that the line 
would show some signs of life: 
co nt in e ntal drift would 
probably get me there quicker. 

"Th en. lat er on, at night," 
he continued , and I caught a 
ne\\ vari ation on the fis h smell 
from his breath . " Iwent to this 
\\ ild pa rt y at a fraterni ty 
hou-.e. great tIme." 

"~I eet lots of broads. huh?" 1 
elbo",ed his ribs. 

"I was t he on hone there." 
"~o gIrls?!!" ) admIt It. I \\ as 

shocked. 
"Well."he l<Xlkeci sad. "there

"So how dId 1\ go \\ It h her?" 
"Not too good. She wore 

leopard skins. We don't ha\'e

Libertarian Dan Douherty sums it up 
continued from page 7 
will happen. I don't care. 
want to live in a free ocietv, I 
don't care who encacts i he 
freedom legislation, 

What aboul till mbers? Holl' 
widespread ill Ihe Liberlarian 
party? 

We have got mayors. and 
people in city hall and in 
school boards acros the 
country. We have 1.000 
candidates thi year running 
for offices acro ss t he country, 
We have candidates in all 50 
states, Four years ago Ed 
Clark \\'as the candidate for 

governor here. He was t he only 
acttve LI bertarian candidate, 
There are 60 active Libertar-
ian candidates in Californ ia 
this year. FOllr years ago,there 
were 7.500 registered 
Libertarian voters. Now we 
have 70.000 regi tered, Four 
years ago Clark got 377,()()() 
vote, I don't know what we're 
going to get thi - year, but it 
will be in the hu ndreds of 
thousand . We are building 
the Libertarian party. Two 
years ago, our president ial 
candidate. Clark. was on the 
ballot in all 50 states. District 

Hurry up and wait

company, thIs guy had a sharp 
mind. 

Just then, the guy in back of 
us, who had been listenmg all 
along, decided to contribute 

~me food for t houghl. 

of Columbia, and Puerto Rico . 
No third party has done that 
since earlv in the centurv. 

HOll ' 111(111), people I'Otl'd /or 
him? 

He gal I 'V". He gOI 900,000 
votes. And thaI was up from 
300,000 votes I hat he got four 
years before when we were on 
t he ballot in just 32 sta tes, The 
party wa ' only founded in 
1971. 

Call you c/wraclerize yo/(r 
cOJlstiluency? Whal Iype 0/ 
groups do you depelld UPOII in 
the eleel iOlls? 

Anybody who has a trong 
emphaSIS on individual rights, 
So those people who are self· 
employed, civIl libertarIans 
who want to get government 
oul of t he business of busting 
people for marijuana and ot her 
victim less crimes, and then 
t here are a lot of very. very 
itbertarIan economists. You 
ha\'e them on campus today . 
They have become very free 
market oriented: the Millon 
FrIedmans: t he Thomas Sols. 
Across a broad spect ru m the 
common theme is indi\' ldual 

rIghI" property righl s, 
voluntary relationships 
bet ween people. and as long as 
you and I aren't violat ing each 
other's rights Ihen there is no 
room for government. 

Is it lrue Ihat yo/( all read Ayn 
Ralld? 

No, it is not ) rue. he was 
never a member of the 
Libertarian party. She wasn't 
even in favor of us being 
formed . Her writings, of, 
course, pUI a tremendous 
emphasis on individual rights. 
The result is that a lot of 
people who have read Ayn 
Rand have ended up in the 
Libertarian party. I think she, 
herself. supported Nixon for 
presidenl in 1972.aithough \\e 
had a Libertarian candidate 
going, She never belonged to 
the party, but. of course, 
e\'crybody recognizes her 
great contribution to the cause 
of Ihe individual.

Poitce, courts, penal system, 
And eyen therc, the goal IS to 

c\'cntually get rid 01 taxes. 
They are theft as far as we'rr 
concerned, Most of the 
securilY fore s today are nOI 
paid for by taxes; they are 
private security forc s-. We 
have all kind<; of privale 
ar bitration services t hat are 
not paid for by taxes. There is 
long precedent for paying for 
s curity forces outside of 
taxes, . and we want to 
encourage that.

we must undcr..,tand realit v. \Ve mll'-o. deal

sticky and ominou!-'· black, slo\\ s eat'h '-otep of 
civilization. There are problem!-' to be worked 
out, such as who is at fault when an illegal 
Unitcd States cluf>.ter bomb kills a quasi.legal 
United tates militar} human being, ] 2.000 
miles away from the only home he has ever 
had. Negotiations, diplomacy, tact, technologv 
and statistics face our modern world's 
troubles. There is no room for sentimental tosh 
about peace and brother I sisterhood in the real 
world. 

Besides, the holiday image maker" still 
support peace. Read any Christmas card (after 
paying your buck and a quarter) or watch the 
TV commercials. They covcr that ..,tuff about 
love and all. It's mighty refreshing. it is. 

However, the rcally important is~uc l1<.'re is 
the relcntlessly ad\ancing opening da\' of the
