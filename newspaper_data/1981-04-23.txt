Bill to litnit student access 
to unentploytnent insurance 

By Rick Dower 
acramento Correspondent 

Legi lators appear poised to begin a 
renewed battle in the tate Assembly over the 
thorny issue of whether or not coIJege 
student should be allowed to coHect 
unemployment benefits. 

Last month Assemblyman Richard 
Robin on re urrected legislation that would 
throw out a recent state Supreme Court 
decision and again make college students 
ineligible to receive unemployment 
compensation if they can't take a full-time job 
becau e of school. 

At present a student can collect payments 
while looking only for part-time work. 

It is the second attempt by Robinson, a 
Democrat from Garden Grove, to have such a 
measure enacted. Last year a similar bill of 

his, after a tortuous trip through both hou es 
where it was amended and re-amended, wa 
approved by the Assembly but died when the 
Senate didn't complete action on it. 

Robinson's proposed legislation could affect 
thousand of college students statewide who 
have been able to collect unemployment 
benefits since 1976, when a series of court 
decisions began upholding a UCLA student's 
right to turn down employment that would 
interfere with her studies but to still collect. 

In 1979, the state Supreme Court ruled that 
Enid Ballantyne, then a UCLA law student, 
had legitimate excuse for not being available 
for full-time work because it would conflict 
with her classes and study.

Speeches dull 
for AS election 

BY PAUL FARWELL 
Staff Writer 

"Thank you . We all 
appreciated that bit of 
campaign rhetoric." 

Judging by the small 
turnout at Monday's 
pre idential forum, only 
David Bockman, who 
introduced the six presiden-
tial candidates and who MC'd 
the event, was enthusiastic 
- albeit sarca tic - about 
the candidates' rhetoric_ 

"All of you students who 
are in cla s right now, please 
don't take that apathetic 
remark too eriously," 
Bockman added, refering to 
the low student turnout at 
the forum, which took place 
at noon on Monday on the 
steps outside the main gym. 

For the six AS pre idential 
hopefuls, the forum was a 
chance to make some last 
minute campaign promises.

ChanceHor Atkinson, a 

supporter of additional 
recreational facilities here, 
has intervened in the AS 
elections to ease electoral 
requirements for the Rec 
Center proposal and other fee 
referendums. 

He has also promised to 
donate $10,000 toward 
construction of the center if 
two-thirds of those voting in 
this election support the 
proposal. 

Atkinson relaxed the 
campus guidelines for fee 
referendums last week after 
meeting with student 
officials and administrators 
who felt the existing 
requirements were "unrea-
listic" and "acted as a 
deterrent to student 
involvement in working for 
change." 

The old guidelines, 
established by former 
Chancellor William McElroy, 
required a 25 percent voter 
turnout and a two-thirds 
favorable vote for passage of 
a new fee or an increa e. 

Traditionally low voter 
turnout here in the past made 
in titution of fees such as the 
recreation center fee and 
increases in fees like the 
activity fee difficult under 
these restrictions.

by AS officials as "very 
positive," are: .

Solidarity's plan for Poland 
Polish sociologIst and union 
member talks here of struggle 

BY JEFF 
BERESFORD-HOWE 

News Editor 

Anna Wyka is defiant, 
proud and sick to death of a 
government that has 
participated in the destruc-
tion of her country's 
economy. 

But she doesn't havea rich, 
bourgeois university to 
which she can retreat, or a 
law school education so she 
can get rich and "work 
within the system for 
change." 

The system where she 
lives - in Warsaw, Poland-
is violently opposed to 
change. So she joined 
Solidarity, as one of its first 
mem bers, and is now 
participating in the stru~le 
to free her country from Its 
"immense crisis - you have 
no idea how immense_" 

Wyka is in the United 
States for six week ,visiting 
universities in Cal ifornia and 
on the East Coast a a 

professional sociologist 
studying the counter-culture. 
But her entireone-and-a-half-
hour visit here Tuesday for a 
socio logy department 
seminar was consumed by 
curiosity over her role in the 
Lech Waelesa -led labor 
movement that has turned 
Poland upside down. 

"Waelesa cannot fail," she 
started off. 

"He feel so responsible for 
the unsuccessful strike of 
1970 ... he feels he has the 
blood on his hands." 

"The 1970 strike" wa an 
un uccessful shipyard strike 
that led to the murder of 
Polish strikers by Polish 
troops. 

Since then, Wyka said, the 
anniversary of the attack 
(Dec. 16) has been celebrated 
every year, and labor leader 
have met and discu ed way 
to improve their movement. 

The result: "Every totalita-
rian society works on 
dividing people. When you do 
that, it is easy to confuse 
them. That is why Solidarity 
is so successful. It cuts across 
aII classes and strata." 

Wyka say Solidarity has 
evolved into a philo ophy 
("not a political party" that 
could break for the first time 
in Soviet Europe, the party 's 
hold on government. 

While -she say it has no 
claims to formal leader hipof 
Poland, "we have a sort of 
shadow cabinet supported by 
a terribly huge movement.. .. 
If you want to improve the 
state, you must work 
through expert bodier " that 
can efficiently handle 
problems the government 
ha shown incapable of 
dealing with, he argue. 

"Only Solidarity would 
organize the e bodie on a 
regional or community ba i 
rather than a trade ba i ,so 
they know th need of 
communitie ," he aid. 

"There would be pecial

~H.B---------------------------------------------------------
Klein's latest charges just a repeat 

Editor: 
Spencer Klein' latest 

letter has been exten ively 
reviewed by the Organization 
of Arab Students, and we are 
amazed that it was even 
printed. The second letter is 
neither more or Jess than a 
reiteration of the first. 
Nothing new was added, 
nothing old was left out. Is 
any zealot who comes along 
entitled to re~t himself 
endlessly in the Guardian 
letters section? We feel 
obligated to answer the 
charges Klein has so 
irresponsibly made but we 
resent the necessity to do so 
twice. We will be as brief as 
we can be. We've confronted 
all of this before. Anyone who 
is interested is welcome to 
look for the first letter in the 
GN07'dwn. 

First, Klein insists that 
anti-Zionist is equivalent to 
anti-Jew. We have already 
stated that this is not how we 
use the word. If anyone else 
wants to engage in a battle of 
semantics that is his 
business; We make a 
distinction between1ews and 
Zionists_ 

Second, we made no 
attempt to redefine Judaism. 
1ewish philosophy may speak 
of the need to dwell in "Eretz 
Yisroel," but that is a very 
different thing from 
conquering it and excluding 
others. We know of no 
biblical passage requiring 
than an exclusively Jewish 
state be established for Jews 
to live in. If there is such a 
passage, however, it only 
demonstrates that religion is 
no basis for land law or any 
law. If some religion requires 
eating female babies for 
breakfast, are we obliged to 
accept this practice because 
someone's ~ demands it? 

Third, fhe notion that 
Israel must exist to provide a 
haven and refuge for Jew is 
entirely debatable. What 
protection can it offer to the 
millions of Jew in the US, 
the USSR and elsewhere? So 
far as we can tell, virtually 
none. And what right have 
Zionist to make the urvival 
of Jews contingent upon the 
exploitation of Pale tin ian ? 
If Klein maintain that the 
Jews in Israel have nowhere 
el e to go, we an wer that 
this is not the fault of 
Palestinians. Not only that, it 
may not be necessary that 
they leave; only that they 
make room for the return of 
the people they displaced. 

Fourth, if you do not 
believe that any jews left 
North Africa as a result of 
Zionist terrrorism, take that 
argument up with Ben 
Gurion. He admits it. 

As for the Koran, well it is 
an interesting religious 
document. But the Palestin-
ians do not define this as a 
Moslem vs. Jew conflict. 
Many of them are Christians. 
This is a land conflict not 
based on religion. 

The letter maintains that 
to a large extent Arabs left 
Palestine for fear of invading 
Jordanian and Syrian and 
Egyptian armies. It goes on to 
quote a London newspaper to 
that effect_ It cannot go 
without notice that British ' 
report was hardly unbiased. 
If you want accurate 
information about the 
outlook of slaves in the 
prewar south, would you a k 
a slave owner? Certainly not. 
Why then should we trust a 
Briti h report about a land 
the British had imperiaiized? 
A French observer had a very 
different impression. This is 
what JacQues de Raynier, 

CARP is dangerous, 
doesn't belong here 
Editor: 

I want to protest the visit of 
the CARP people to our 
campus last week. I didn't see 
any UCSD students among 
them. Most of them were 
older people or young 
Moonies. Who invited these 
people? Were there an y 
UCSD students involved in 
their visit? 

Of course, there are other 
things besides their origin 
which irked me. Their 
speeches were nothing more 
than reactionary -rightist 
rhetoric. Sometimes their 
statements were outright 
lies. How could Marxists 
have killed "miIlions of 
people throughout the 
centuries" when Marx 
himself was born only in the 
la t century? How can they 
say that President Duarte 
was freely elected when he is 
a mere puppet of the 
generals? How can they say 

'communists' are the only 
ones opposing the govern-
ment when in reality 
everybody but the ruling 
elites is against the 
oppres ing regim~? 

It is not true that land is 
being di tributed. Human 
right are not respected. And 
there is no such thing as "free 
elections" in EI Salvador. 

Finally, if these people 
think that the present 
government of EI Salvador i 
so just, I have a suggestion. 
Why don 't they go to an EI 
Salvadorean village in the 
path of the EI Salvadorean 
army? We'll see how many of 
them will come back and 
preach US intervention after 
they are tortured and 
murdered by the military 
whom the US government is 
so generously providing with 
arms and adviee!

chief delegate to the 
International Red Cro shad 
to say about the Deir Yassin 
village. 

"There had been 400 
people in thi village; about 
fifty of them had escaped, and 
were still alive. All the re t 
had been deliberatel y 
massacred in cold blood for, 
a I observed for myself, thi 
gan~ (t he Irgun) wa 
admirably di ciplined and 
only acted under orders .... 
Driven by fear, the Arab left 
their homes to find shelter 
among their kindred .... Final-
Iy , about 700,000 Arab 
became refugee, leaving 
everything behind in their 
haste, their one hope being to 
avoid the fate of the people of 
Deir Yassin .. . " 

Mr. Klein quotes a British 
police report to the effect that 
everY effort wa made to 

retaIn the Arab population. 
Again , the ource of thi 
report is obviou Iyu u peet 
and in thelightofDeirYa sin 
the report is imply not 
credible at all. Moreover, 
there is not the lighte t 
chance thilt Deir Ya sin was 
some kind of bizarre accident. 
Here is the testimony of the 
I raeli League for Human and 
Civil Rights,Jerusalem,1975. 

"The plan to make Arab 
Palestine into a jewish state 
ha in volved the total 
de trucl ion of 385 Arab 
vilage leaving only 90 of the 
original 475 village . In the 
district of Bethlehem, for 
example, all 23 Arab vi llages 
were de troyed, leaving only 
Jaffa city. All 31 vilages in 
Ramleh di triet have been 
de troyed since 1948. Former 
Defense Minister Mo he 
Davan ha acknowledged 

tha-t 'There i not a sin-gle 
Jewish illage in thi country 
that ha not been built on the 
site of an Arab illage' ." 

Kl ein que tion my 
stat istics as to the num ber of 
Palestinian refugees and says 
I contradicted myself. I did 
not. The population stati tics 
I quoted were for 1922, not 
1948. Refugee statistics, 
however, come from 1948. As 
you will note in April 1948, 
Ragnier cited about 700,000 
refugee . By May 1948 thi 
number had swelled to 
960,000. At the pre ent time, 
the refugee who left in 1967 
well that numbertooverone 

million, even if we neglect the 
fact that "a few" children 
have been born since 1948.

Despite faults, Bekken's best 
Editor: 

I usually don't talk about 
AS elections because they are 
so phenomenally insignifi-
cant. In my coUegiate career 
the only activity that I found 
more boring than going to 
calculus lectures was 
attending AS meeting . 
Dante, in Inferno , de cribed 
no worse a torture than 
sitting through an entire 
session. Be that as it may, I 
ne ertheless feel compelled 
to endor e Jon Bekken and 
the Immoral Minority for 
office. "Bekken is a dogmatic 
Communist, a pedantic a s 
and a longwinded boor," you 
s ay . Indeed . Bekken is 
verbose enough to compete 
with Castro in a speech 
length contest . And the 
quality of the tone of his voice 
and his manner of speech are 
enough to give a speech 
pathologi t DTs. I know 
because I was forced to sit 
through his lengthy diatribe 
at AS meeting _ 

But all these sins are 
forgivable. Certainly the way 
a man talks doesn't affect his 

character. Aithough one can 
attack Bekken's party line 
Communism as unrealistic in 
a post industrial America, in 
the final analysis, his 
Communism is an act of 
faith_ Everyone believes in 
something, thus it is overly 
har h to attack a person for 
hi faith. (This statement is 
of dubious value to 
Con ervative , but even they 
can vote for Bekken because 
the office of AS President is 
essentially powerless.) 

What I find exceptional 
about Bekken is his bravery. 
Although Intellectuals have 
proclaimed the dimunition of 
spirit, the lack of heroism, 
and the end of mystery in our 
age, there is a hero amongus : 
his name is jon Bekken. He 
has been arrested for 
protesting again t draft 
registration, and is facing 
charges for his assault on 
Corporate America in the 
pages of the new indicator. 
Those of you who are not well 
versed in the concept of civil 
disobedience may well ask 
what is heroic about breaking 

Plant a peace garden 
Editor: 

I recently witnessed the 
opposing factions regarding 
EI Salvador. These events 
reminded me of Berkeley in 
the late 60s - sad and 
disappointing and frustra-
ting. 

Let me offer a suggestion to 
those students who feel a call 

to demonstrate. Why not 
start a UCSD garden, such as 
I saw at UC Riverside and 
Santa Cruz years ago. All you 
need is land, interested 
students and gardeners, and 
permission to plant. 

That is produdion with 
meaning. 

Brian Thompson 

the law. The answer is, of 
course, that civil disobedi-
ence is the supreme act of 
courage. To oppose that state 
because it is acting 
immorally and to be arrested 
for that opposition is one of 
the grandest actions a man 
can take. 

Hasjosh (TGIF) Harris had 
the moral courage to perform 
an act of civil disobedience? 
- I think not. In general all of 
these candidates have one 
reason for running for office: 
to pad their transcripts for 
grad school and business. I 
know, I did the same thing. 
aut Bekken doesn 't give a 
shit about what the grad 
schools think of him, (the fact 
that he was arrested proves 
that) and that 's what is great 
about him. He has put his 
moral beliefs above the 
expediency of going to grad 
chool and getting a job. He 

ha refused to be beaten into 
the mold of the organiza-
tional man by corporate 
America. He doesn't just 
complain about corporations 
dominating our lives, he goes 
out and fights them. He 
doesn't worry about El 
Salvador, and US militarism; 
he protests against the 
government to the point of 
being arrested. None of the 
other candidates have the 
guts to do this. Bekken's 
candidacy shines like a 
burning light through the 
bullshit and phoney ness of 
the AS elections. There is 
still time, go out and vote for 
Bekken and the Immoral 
Minority.

'Bel Ami, , audience, not really 
as bad as group perceived it 
Editor: 

Congratulation , you 
innocent five, who, out of 
utterly innocent curiosity 
and wholly a exual intere t 
innocently attended the 
showing of Bil Ami la t 
Tuesday night. Certainly 
anyone with any degree of 
contact with modern 
society knows what to 
expect of X-rated films uch 
as Bel A mi, even if the 
content of this film hadn 't 
been part of its posted 
advertisements. 

I did not see this film, nor 
did I pay great attention to 
the advertisements for it, 
but I till know that the film 
wa put on by the "Martial 
Art Club" or some such -
how could you five be 
collectively ignorant of this? 
Perhaps it was convenient 
to hirk what you eem to 
feel i your "mi ion from 
God" - to chastize the 
perpetrator - by feigning 
ignorance (or inability to 
di cover) the identity of 
sponsors of the film? 
Instead of spewing it out 
through the Guardian, 
conveniently avoiding 
direct confrontation with 
those you feel are respon-
sible, why not go directly to 
the sponsors and complain, 
and maybe then write about 
it? 

As for rour "shocked and 
appalled' descriptions of 
pape - ad fights , the ,.. . 

re idue of which wa 
horribly " ... Ieft for other " 
to clean up, I can think of 
many more shocking acts of 
vandali m around campus. 
Further, you need not be so 
horrified at audience 
participation in and 
reaction to the action and 
bodies on the screen; the 
di ssemination of such 
media has long been a hotly 
debated issue among all 
factions, and ultimately it is 
a caveat emptor situation: 
you are 'buying' the right to 
see such a film, and if you 
are concerned about the 
content of a film you are 
going to ee, then 'beware!' 
(f people like yourselves are 
"curiou "enough to pay to 
see such afilm, is it thefault 
of tho e who pay to eesuch 
a film, i it the fault of tho e 
who offer it that it i 
profitable. Re t assured, the 
X-rated film industry does 
not survive on one-time 
viewers who walk away 
disgusted; and if you think 
that the industry's films 
degrade women, take it up 
with the millions of viewers 
who are "curious" enough 
to see one or more. 

Question: Is what you 
saw on screen any worse 
than whatallofyour mind's 
eyes conjure tip so many 
times in a day? No, don 't 
give me that puritanical 
crap about your inviolable 
chastity. be it mental or 

physic'al ; the steamie t 
bedrooms exist not on 
screen, but in our minds. 
You are probably ripe for a 
reevaluation of how all this 
lust really relates to love -
which is alive and well; I 
feel that your concern over 
the audiences' sexist 
catcalls is entirely 
unfounded: lust is only 
rarely associated with love, 
you r fear that this "99 
percent young male 
audience" i a veritable 
army of physicalist with 
no concept of love show 
lack of under tanding of 
human nature and biologi-
cal needs on a macroscopic 
scale and e peeially at an 
in titution of adolescent . 

Love i simply not 
something t hat the vast 
majority of moviegoers 
expect to ee portrayed in a 
film such as Bel A mi; indeed 
love and sex are rarely if 
ever uccessfully blended in 
the world of cinemato-
graphy. 

And if a porn film - an 
inherently sexist medium 
- comes across as exist, 
what is the significance of 
figuratively telling u "who 
is buried in Grant's tomb" 
by calling it sexist? The film 
is not 'propagation' of 
sexism - the disease you 
are speaking out against -
rather it is a symptom.

Was 'trial' justified 
Editor: 

In a recent let ter,Josephine 
Rambo ets herself up a the 
'defense' in a would·be 'trial' 
of Dr. Tolbert. I would like to 
add res three points she 
make. 

1 - Rambo ays "let me 
state that this professor has a 
more than adequate amount 
of pu bl ications ... " Quest ion: 
What are Rambo's qualifica-
tions for making this 
judgment? 

2 - Rambo say "the 
steady disappearance of 
Black profe sor ... is evidence 
of a y tematic effort.. .to bar 
the eprofessor .... " joe Blow, 
on the other hand, concluded 
to me recently that this 
'disappearacne' is evidenceof 
a migration of Black 
professors to Australia. I 
conclude that both state-
ments carry about the same 
weight (read 'none' here). 

3 - Finally, and most 
absurdly, Rambo says "the 
guilt or innocence of the 
UCSD administration in 
keeping professors of color 
barred ... will be determined in 

their decision to rule in favor 
or not in favor of tenure for 
this profe or." I presume 
she means 'they' wilI be 
guilty if t hey do not grant 
tenure to Dr. Tolbert. Thu 
the situation is, because 
Rambo has decided that Dr. 
Tolbert is indeed qualified, a 
refusal to grant tenure will be 
proof that there is a 
conspiracy. This claim is 
entirely based on the 
assumption that Rambo is 
Qualified to make this 
decision. Is she? 

Even if she is, if the people 
tasked with making this 
decision disagree with her, 
then she concludes this will 
be proof of a conspiracy_ The 
argumentation here is scary. 

The issue here is not 
whet he! Dr. Tolbert is 
qualified or not, that is to be 
determined. The issue is the 
line of reasoning in Rambo's 
arguments . It is so ludicrous 
that is does a disservice to the 
cause it i intended to 
support.

Atkinson sets 
rules for turnout 
Demands 20% to legitimize 
Recreation Center vote 
continued from page 1 
voting on an issue will ensure 
that the proposition will be 
submitted to the President 
and the Board of Regents 
(who have the final say on fee 
referendums). 

2) An affirmative vote of a 
simple majority but less than 
two-thirds of those voting on 
an issue will ensure that the 
proposition be considered by 
the Chancellor for submis-
sion to the President and the 
Board of Regents. The 
Chancellor will take other 
relevant matters into 
account in deciding whether 
to submit the item to the 
Regents. 

3) Fir referendums voted 
during the annual general 
elections. there shall be no 
minimum requirement of 
votes case. Special referen-
dums. however. will not be 
considered valid unless one-
fifth or more of eligible voters 
cast ballots. 

"Given voter apathy. it 
was often self-defeating for a 
student to push a referendum 
question knowing he needed 
a 25 percent turnout and then 
two-thirds in favor for it to 
pass." said AS Advisor 
Randy Woodard. 

"These new guidelines are 
very open . They allow 
someone who really cares 
about an issue to launch an 
all-()ut campai~ and have a 
chance." he saId. 

Woodard cited the 
Recreation Center referen-
dum in 1979 as an example of 
the restrictiveness of the 
former guidelines. 

"That year . 80 percent of . 
the students voted for it." he 
said. "But the voter turnout 
was below 25 percent." 

Students finally voted 
overwhelmingly to assess 
themselves a $6.50 Rec 
Center fee last year. by a 1195 
vote margin. 

But campus planners now 
say the $6.50 fee will not 
cover maintenance costs and 
inflationary utility costs at 
the center after six or seven 

quently. students are being 
asked this r.ear to assess 
themselves 'a fee not to 
exceed $12 per quarter" to 
pay for the facility. 

The center. which would 
be located near the Warren 
campus. would consist of 
racquetball courts. a 25· 
meter pool with jacuzzi. 
locker rooms with showers 
and space for additional 
courts and a gymnasium. 

The center's charter 
stipulates that student fees 
would not be raised until 
construction of the facility is 
completed. 

The new guidelines may do 
more than support recreation 
here. however. as they may 
help the AS win the 
desperately needed activity 
fee increase it has sought for 
years. 

Should a majority of 
students vote in favor of an 
increase of the $6 fee. which 
has not changed ince 1968. 
Atkinson ma y consider 
"other relevant matters." 
and could submit the item to 
the Regents despite its failure 
to get two-thirds of the 
student vote. 

"I think the Chancellor 
would consider things like. 
'Will the AS be more effective 
with the increase? Who will 
benefit from the increa e? 
How many students voted? 
What do the AS and the 
college councils think about 
the increase?'" said AS 
President Bill Topkis. 

Should the Chancellor not 
view student support of a 
measure adequate to merit its 
submission to the Regents. 
Topkis noted. students could 
themselves submit a proposal 
to the Board through current 
student regent Leslie Lurie. 

Both Topkis and Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Richard Armitage believe the 
one-fifth voter turnout 
requirement for special 
referendums (those not held 
during the general April 
elections) is wise.

Proxy candidates 
have ho-hum debate 

continued from page 1 
was the last chance to assess 
candidates before the voting 
yesterday and today. 

Un fort unately for the 
candidate • though. very few 
students showed up to listen. 

"Students just don't care 
about elections." complained 
Melissa Ligman. Commis-
sioner of Elect ions and 
coordi nator of the forum. 

Student apathy. neverthe-
less. didn' t keep the AS 
politicians from speaking. In 
fact. candidate prudently 
u ed every minute of time 
allotted them for the 
purposes of political rhetoric . 

"You have to have a 
vision." stated candidate 
Jules Bagneris (Respect with 
Perspective). 

"Students have to unite!" 
cou ntered candidate Mitch 
Sosna (Action : not Reaction). 

"As undergraduates. we 
are the power in the 
university.' said indepen-
dent Mark Massara. 

The plan of the forum was 
to have each candidate speak 
for five minutes. and after the 
30 minutes of speeches were 
over. to have the floor open 
for questions. Three 
questions were asked by the 
audience: "How do you feel 
about Nuclear research by 
UCSD in t he Los Alamos and 
Livermore labs?" 

"Do you support funding 
Joe' Escort Service?" 

And "Do you support 
funding KSDT radio?" 

All candidates opposed 
n uc\ear research but 
advocated more AS pending 
on Joe's Escort Service and 
KSDT. 

Candidates were also 
allowed a one·minute closing 
comment. 

Five of the six candidates 
were present themelves. with 
only Todd Thompson, vice-
presidential candidate. filling 
In for Jmmoral Minority 
leader Jon Bekken . who was 
said to be stricken with a 
throat ailment. 

When asked about the 
forum. Bekken commented. 
" J would have done a more 
abiding job than Todd. but he 
did pretty welI for a last-
minute stab." 

There was considerable 
speculation that Bekken 
avoided speaking at the 
forum for fear that a member 
of the audience would ask 
about his current legal 
hassles with Pacific 
Telephone. 

Bekken, who denied the 
rumor. has been charged 
with violating state law by 
illegally printing telephone 
codes in the new indicator. of 
which he is a collective 
member.

One AS 
election 
complaint 
Are slates too 
close together? 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
Staff Writer 

There was little mudsling· 
ing. few threats and just not 
much for the AS Elections 
Commission to do during this 
year's campaign. 

In fact. if two slates hadn't 
been accused of a significant 
election code violation last 
week. only minor posting and 
budget infractions would 
have been remembered as 
marring an otherwise perfect 
record for the 1981-82 AS 
candidates. 

But presidential contender 
Jon Bekken. on the Immoral 
Minority slate. charged The 
Student Slate and Students 
For Change of coordinating 
their campaigns to become 
one slate. as per the AS 
Election Code's definition of a 
slate. 

"It is clear that The 
Student Slate and Students 
For Change are ... one slate-
not only do they endorse each 
other in their campaign 
publicity. buttheir names are 
placed on campaign material 
in a coordinated way." said 
Bekken in a letter to the 
Elections Commission. 

Bekken requested that the 
Elections Commission 
acknowledge that the slates 
are in fact one slate. and 
adjust the spending limit of 
their candidates accordingly. 

Slates with two or more 
members may spend $50 for 
the first candidate and $25 
for each additional candidate. 

The Elections Commission 
rejected Bekken's request.

Regents percolating 
through legislature 

LIBRARY SALE 
A good bargain is hard to find these days, but book lovers will 

find thousands of bargains at the ninth annual Friends of the 
UCSD Library Book Sale, from 10 am to 5 pm Saturday, May 9 . 

Lawmakers on . sprIng recess The sale will be conducted in front of the Central Library. About 10,000 books will be available, with a majority of them 
priced at less than one dollar. 

BY RICK DOWER 
Sacramento Correspondent 

While lawmakers have 
temporarily deserted the 
<;8pital on their annual spring 
fece.ss, a handful of major 
bills challenging the UC 
Board of Regents are 
percolating slowly through 
the State Legislature. 

University and legislative 
sources agree there appears 

. to be an unusually intense 
amount of activity in 
Sacramento directed at the 
way the Regents and UC do 
business. 

"It sure seems that way," 
said Regent Yori Wada. 

The bills, which all touch 
on issues of the Regents' 
constitutional autonomy in 
governing the university, 
will begin their round of 
hearings over the next few 
weeks. 

All the measures are 
certain to create a great stir 
!han they already have and 
will probably be hotly 
ilebated. 

he Regent s right to 
determine tuition, meet in 
the executive sessions and 
personally invest in 
companies the University 
also invests in are at stake in 
the three Assem bly measures 
and two Senate proposals. 

The slew of legislation, 
with the controversial 

of Assembly 
Willie Brown as a 

regent, promise to make this 
season even more of a 
legislative headache than 
usual for the University. 

Brown has apparently run 
into unexpected trouble with 
his confirmation by the 
Senate Rules Committee, 
once assured to be smooth 
sailing for him, and has 
successfully stalled the 
hearing indefinitely until he 
can muster support. 

A 11 of the proposed 
legislation and Brown 's 
appointment to a 12-year 
term are opposed by the 
Unviersity, primarily on 
constitutional grounds. 

The UC Student Lobby, on 
the other hand, supports the 
bills affecting the University 
and Brown's confirmation. 

Student Lobby co-director-
Paul Rogers said he isn't sure 
why there is so much 
legislative action involving 
the University and Regents 
this year. 

"A lot of it may arise out of 
frustration people have been 
feeling year after year trying 
to convince the Regents to 
voluntarily be more open 
about how they go about their 
bu iness," said Rogers, who 
six-person staff closely 
monitors and advocates for 
legislation. 

"After awhile when they 
realize there isn't going to be 
any internal solution, ther. 
~~~.~ to legislative solutions, ' 

he said. 
The Student Lobby has 

sponsored legislation in both 
the SeDate and A embly 
that would require the 
Regents to return to the state 
any revenue UC collected if 
they decided to charge tuition 
to resident students. 

The lobby intent in the 
carefully-worded bills is to 
remove the financial 
incentive for the Regents to 
charge tuition while not 
express Iy violating their 
constitutional mandate to be 
the sole body to set student 
fees at UC. 

UC General Counsel 
Donald Reidhaar agreed that 
while UC is always a target 
for legislators, there seems to 
be increasing legislative 
challenges to the University. 
He said all of the current . 
pending legislation poses 
serious constitutional 
question . 

Reidhaar said any stepped· 
up activity by lawmakers 
toward the Unviersity this 
year may be "because at 
times legislators believe they 
possess greater individual ' 
wisdom than do the Regents 
collect ively. 

"Or, there may be the 
occasion when a legislator 
thinks it would be politically 
beneficial to propose a certain 
measure without really, 
caring about the outcome, ' 
he continued. 

Most of the books are clothbound and include a wide variety 
of general and scholarly works on subjects ranging from 
history and literature to the social and physical sciences. 

All books will be put out for selection during the first three 
hours of the sale. 

"In my mind it is always a 
serious matter when the 
Legislature tries to under· 
mine the University's 
authority." 

The flurry of legislative 
interest is keeping the 
Unviersity's three·person 
Sacramento staff busy. 

Lowell Paige, UC President 
David Saxon's special 
assistant for governmental 
affairs, said the primary 
interest of his office is 
monitoring legislation that 
could adversely threaten the 
University's autonomy. 

Paige said legi lators often 
propose bills affecting the 
Umversity of California 
without fully understanding 
the constitutional guaran· 
tees under which the 
University operates. 

Repeatedly raising the 
issue of constitutional 

infrin~ement, UC has 
maintamed a fairly good 
record in fending off 
challenges from the Legisla· 
ture. 

Sen. Barry Keene's bill, SB 
252, requires the Regents to 
adhere to the State Agency 
Open Meeting Act. 

The bill as originally 

written would substantially 
narrow t he reason for which 
the Regents could meet in 
closed session and would 
relax certain procedures 
govemin~ public asccess to 
the meettn~s. 

An identical bill is waiting 
in the wings in the Assembly, 
authored independently by 
Los Angeles Democrat Gwen 
Moore. 

The twin tuition bills, 
being carried by Senator Jim 
Nielsen, R·Wodland and 
Assemblyman Charles 
Imbrecht, R-Venture, may be 
heard as early as by the end of 
the month. 

Imbrecht earlier said he 
submitted his measure, after 
it was drafted and suggested 
by the Student Lobby, to gain 
tighter fiscal control over the 
state's revenue. 

Finally, two weeks ago, 
Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown dropped a major bomb 
on the Board of Regents with 
his conflict of interest bill to 
prohi bi t a regen t from 
holding stock in any company 

~r corporation UC also

Bill to limit student access 
to unentployment insurance 

continued from page 1 
The high court said 

Ballantyne should not have 
to choose between her 
education and her benefits. 

State policy until the 
Ballantyne decIsion had been 
that in order to collect 
unemployment payments, an 
individual had to be availa ble 
to look for and accept a fu ll-
time job. 

Robin son's current 
measure, AB 1760, is backed 
mainly by the influential 
California Taxpayer 's 
Association and the state 
Chamber of Commerce_ 

His earlier bill was 
requested by the state 
Employment Development 
Department (EDD), but this 
time the state did not propose 
AB 1760 and has not yet 
taken a stand on it, accordmg 
to department spokesman 
Allen Davenport. 

The EDD is the state 
agency that determines a 
claimant's eligibility and 
disburses the payments , 
which amount to more than a 
billion dollars annually in 
unemployment benefits. 

Larry McCarthy, a lobbyist 
with the California Tax-
payers Association, argues 

that allowing students to 
seek only part-time jobs or 
otherwise treating them 
differentially from other 
claimant s sets up a 
"preferential category" just 
for college students. 

"It's been a major loophole 
in the system, and t he 
employer community is 
strongly opposed to it, " 
McCarthy said, adding that a 
sizable number of the 
assocation's members are 
businessmen who pay into 
the unemployment insurance 
pool. 

But student groups, led by 
the UC Student Lobby and 
the California State Student 
Assocation, c harge t hat 
Robin son's bill would 
unfairly discriminate against 
students because it would 
single them out in sp'ite of a 
sate code prohlbiti ng 
discri m in ati on again st 
claimants solely because 
they're students. 

"We're concerned with 
those students who were 
working part-time to put

'Without the benefits to 
tide them over until they find 
another job, some may be 
forced to drop out of school." 

In 1979, the student lobby 
was successful in having 
Robinson 's bill amended to 
permit students to continue 
to be available just for part-
time work while attending 
school. The part-time issue 
has become the major point of 
contention between the two 
sides_ 

The EDD estimates the 
state could save at least $2.5 
million by cutting off the 
claims of 2,500 students who 
currently receive benefits 
without seeking full -time 
work. 

However, some estimates 
range to several times that 
number because the depart-
ment does not keep statistics 
on categories of claimants. 

" We're not picking on 
students as a group," said the 
EDD's Davenport. "The' 
issue is over whether you're 
available for full -time work. 
It doesn 't matter whether 
you're a student or not ; we'd 
like to see the law applied 
acros the board."

High school students 
must work harder 

BERKELEY - Contrary 
to popular belief, students 
need to do more than meet 
the minimum entrance 
requirements to do well at 
the University of California. 

That is the message to 
high school studen ts and 
counselors in a newsletter 
UC sent this month to all 
California high schools. 

"A student who is well-
prepared for University 
work will have taken four 
years of English in high 
school, three to four years of 
mathematics, two to three 
years of foreign language, 
two to three years of 
laboratory science, one year 
of history, and one or more 
years of art or humanities," 
the message states. 

UC admission require-
ments call for the suggested 
four years of English, but 
for only two years of 
mathematics, two years of a 
foreign language, one year 
of laboratory science, one 
year of history, and one or 
two years of advanced work 
in mathematics, foreign 
language or science_ 

The message stresses 
that UC acmission require-
ments are " mi"imum 
entrance requirements," 

and fall short of what UC 
recommends high school 
students take in order to be 
preparecl for university-
level work. 

Alice C. Cox, assistant 
vice president for student 
ac d mic servic s at UC, 
has included the message 
about prepari ng for 
universi ty-level work in the 
newsletter that is regularly 
sent to high schools in the 
hope that the statement will 
"shift the focus of college 
preparatory program from 
lists of required courses and 
qualifying test scores to the 
more improtant emphasis of 
how well a student is able to 
think and what basic 
knowledge and skills he or 
s he must acquire to succed 
at the University." 

The statement, prepared 
by Cox in consultation with 
UC faculty, academic 
administrators and the 
Academic Senate Board on 
Admissions and Relations 
with Schools, suggests that 
students "should learn to 
read analytically and 
critically, actively question-
ing themselves about the 
author's intentions, 
viewpoint, arguments, and 
conclusions. "

Solidarity 
has plans 
for Poland 
Union member 
lectures here 
continued from page 1 
educational experts, health 
experts, etc., and they would 
know their own area, and get 
good information. Credible 
information is necessary, and 
you can't get it from the 
government. 

"You then give your report 
to the government or party or 
parliament body that is 
working on it, such as in 
mental health, which I am 
interested in. 

"Sometimes it works and 
sometimes it doesn't ." 

These Solidarity units 
formed "in a rash" last 
summer, she said, transform-
ing the way people looked for 
help. 

" In the Solidarity bureau 
in Warsaw, one women who 
felt she was about to give 
birth went Quickly to 
Solidarity, because maybe 
she could be helped there. 
And it was just the case. 

"I worked on Solidarity 
mental health committee and 
so-called unofficial culture 
committee; we worked on 
grass roots theater groups, 
therapy and art work with 
ex-drug addicts. 

"If they wear very, very 
strange clothes or have 
strange behavior, different 
from the dominant behavior, 
then they need some space. 
We need a center, and the 
church was very helpful. " 

She also credits the church 
for helping Solidarity in two 
other ways: first, the visit of 
Pope John Paul II, a Pole, 
brought Poles of all kinds 
together; seco nd , the 
Catholic Intelle~en tia Club, 
(CIC ), a "Chnstian more 
than Catholic" group, has 
provided material advice to 
Solidarity units on how to 
organize. 

They have done so, she 
says, because the CIC is a 
place where " we can debate 
free from censorship." 

Will Solidarity be crushed 
under the iron heel of Soviet 
jackboots? Wyka thinks 
emphatically not. 

"It will not happe n. First , 
there is the economic state of 
the whole Soviet bloc. All the 
countries have terrible debts, 
including the USSR , to 
Western countries." 

(Western Europe and the 
US have both threatened to 
cut off all economic aid to the 
USSR in the event of an 
invasion). 

"And second, it would be 
disastrous to our economy if 
the Soviets intervened. Who 
would work? People would 
stop work. It would be the 
end of the economy, theend of 
our land. 

'There · is only one time 
when I was a bit scared of a 
Soviet threat, and that was 
just before I left for the 
United States (two weeks 
ago). There were manoeuvers 
in Poland by the Soviets 
shown on TV every day a a 
psychological threat, but 
they go on all the time. I was a 
little scared, thou~h, when 
our troops were WIthdrawn 
from t he manoeuver for the 
first time." ,

Teu, Nastassia Kinski, as Tess of the

decent man would give his soul for. 
With dark, expressIVe eyes and full

course, Roman Polanski - in a radICal 
departure from his usual type of mcwie 
- does a fine Job in bringing thv 
Thomas HcYdy flCM!1 of lo.oe and 
hypocrosy to the screen. The ra" 
injustices of late 19th century England 
blend well with the beautiful, enduring 
countryside. But if Kinski didn't exist 
Polanski would rave had to irTYenther.1f 
the actress playing Tess isn't someone 
the audience can care for, no one 
lMJuld sit through this three-hour

Futnbling with Deadly Digits 
Feeling a sudden need to 

investigate possible escape 
routes. she gave the door of 
her hotel room a hard look 
while trying to swallow a 
lump in her throat Seeing 
that the door was unlocked, 
open by the s lightest crack 
for anyone passing in the hall 
could see what was going on 
if they were the nosy sort , she 
t urned toward him again. 
thinking "Oh shit" 

"What?" she asked. as 
though she'd only half-heard 
what he'd said. He was 
s itting in a chair by the 
writing table with his legs 
crossed, crushing a cigarette 
in the ashtray. 

"Oh, sorry ," he offered, 
uncrossi ng h is legs and 
s itting upright , "Guess that 
does sound a little off the 

. wall." He gave a slight smile. 
"You said something about 

your hands." she said. almost 
stammering_ 

"Yeah. What I meant by 
having 'registered hands' is 
that the cop consider my 
hands to be like lethal 
weapons, You know, since I 
have a black belt and 
everything," While talking 
he held his hands out and 
opened them, looking as 
though he were trying to 
open a window that wouldn't 
slide. rubbed them in a 
manner that suggested 
someone washing for dinner, 
and then folded them, 
allowing them to rest in the 
lap of his re-crossed legs, He 
gave her another smile, 
broader this time, allowing 
the full gleam of his green 
eyes to flash like lights at a 
train crossing, Confused , she 
returned the smile, her lips 

rigid, 
"You mean the cops think 

of you the same way they 
would a boxer? I think I read 
that somewhere?" Her tight 
smile was beginning to make 
her face muscles ache. 

He nodded. hi s head 
moving back and forth three 
times slowly, 

"Exactly, " he said, 
pointing a finger at her, then 
unfolding his fingers and 
raising his hands again. 
"these hands, so t rained, can 
easily kill or maim someone," 

She thought he looked 

Bare Wires 

rather absurd, sitting there 
with his hands raised , his 
voice assuming a lower tone 
as though he were a high-
priced lawyer finishing his 
summation with a theatrical 
flourish that smacked of 
amateur theatre Shakes-
peare, talkin~ about how his 
hands can 'maim or kilL" 
She was going to laugh then , 
bu t he nodded again at her 
and gave her his broadest 
smile yet, bearing all his 
milk-white teeth as his eyes 
narrowed and slanted to one 
side, pointing toward her, 
seeming to indicate that both 
of them shared something 
that hadn 't been spoken, 

What gives? she thought. 
Does this guy have hands 
that can "maim or kill" or 
not? Something didn't ring 
right here, 

"A bit stuffy in here." he 
said, tugging at his collar, 

"Mind if I undo mr tie?" 
"Oh, not at all: she said , 

"Go right ahead ." As he 
straigh tened himself and 
began to undo his tie, his 
fingers fastidious ly undoing 
the knot like someone not 
wanting to wrinkle hi s 
clothes, she stared at the 
hands, His fi ngers were long 
and thin. almost delicate in 
their shape, fingers resem-
bling those of the roving 
guitarist in the restaurant 
downstairs where she'd met 
him three hours earlier. 
Likewise, the palms seemed 
soft and fleshy. free of 
callouses, hands not used to 
hard labor. She blinked, 
tusged at the hem of her 
skIrt , and brushed a s trand of 
hair from her eyes. The room 
filled with an awkward 
quiet.. 

"So," she began, more 
nervous with the si lence than 
its lack, "does this help you 
with your job? You said you 
were in sales and you said 
you amId usually get your 
way by mentioning your 
hands.' 

He gave a st iff laugh, like a 
cough or a bark. 

"Ahhhh no." he said, 
waVing a palm. "( don 't even 
know why I brou~ht up the 
'registered hands thing, I 
just meant that I've always 
been so mething of a 
persuasive talker, something 
that's needed if you're gonna 
be in sales, and that's a skill 
that's helped me make a lot of 
sales from customers who'd 
otherwise be reluctant to 
buy,· Also. I've been able to 
talk my way out of fights by 
making whatever asshole I'm

Now s he nodded. "Okay, I

"I mean y.0u don't get jobs

an art. Y'know, gain a guys' 
trust, persuade them that our 
company has the best stuff 
for the money, and so on ... " 

She nodded through this, 
rapidly at first, but slowing 
to the rhythm of an absently 
pushed rocking chair as his 
spiel continued to unwind. 

"What I'd really want to 
do," he went on, clenching a

fist momentarily, "what I'd 
really want to do is get into

late-night phone in shows. I'd 
rather talk about what 's 
happening in the world with 
other people, like about 
Poland or gun control , 
instead of how my company 
is the best in the market. " 

He paused as though to let 
her add something to what 
there was of the conversa· 
tion, but she didn't know 
what to say to someone she 
barely knew talking about 
something she had little 
interest in. Why did she 
invite him to her room? She 
blanked out for a second to 
think about this and came on 

the answer at once: he !Scute, 
in a long lean way, with 
pleasant green eyes and a 
store of punchlines that could 
charm a snake out of its skin . 
Unfortunatel y he now 
seemed to have exhausted his 
supply of jokes, and was 
nothing but an empty bore in 
a pretty wrapping. 

"What do you think," he 
asked . She'd been staring, 
unconsciously, at the ashtray 
he was dumping hi ashes 
into when he s poke . 
Desperate to say anything, 
she picked up the gauntlet. 

"Oh sure," she said , " I 
think that you 'd do real well 
with a show like that. You are 
a good talker and have plenty 

of good lines that you can use. 
1 mean, [ can tell jus t by how

"No, no really. You have a

modulated, and you can keep

keep it interesting. I mean the 
way you explained the thing 
about 'registered hands' was 
interesting, Y'know ?" 

He yawned and ran a hand 
through his short , wire-curl 
hair. 

"Well maybe," he spoke 
through the yawn. ' 'I'll at

Make some audition tapes 
and give 'em to some guy I 
know in LA." 

"Yes , you should ," she 
said, stifling a yawn her elf . 

At that moment the 
conversation dropped off and 
another awkward quiet filled 
the room, broken only by the 
casual stirrings of palm 
leaves swaying in the wind . 
They sat there for a moment 
or two, and in that time their 
eyes drifted from each other 
and roamed disinterestedl y 
over the wall hangings" the 
furniture, doorkno~, and 
then met again (ull , ~irc1e . 
The gazes were nervous and 
uncertain , wide for ,want of 
anything to say . Th ey 
exchanged grins that Dnly 
enhanced the awkwardne s 
and turned it into embarrass-
ment. 

He pushed up thecutf pf his 
shirt sleeve and look,ed at his 
watch and managed a look of 
mock astonishment. 

"Later than I thoughtl" he 
said , "Better hit tbe road. 
Early meeting with clients." 

She rose from ~er ,sejlt as 
he got off his chair and met 
him at the door. He stopped 
when the door w as half 
opened and gave a long look, 
as though to say something, 

"Had a nice time tonight," 
he said ins tead. 

"So did 1. Thanks for 
dinner." 

"No sweat," he aid. !Ie put 
his arms around her waist, 
drew her close, and ga ve her a 
light kiss. He ran a fingertip 
across her cheek. His touch 
was gentle, she thought , like 
silk. His finger was softer 
than it looked . 

She pulled herself away. 
"Tell me. Are your hand 

really registered? Can you

was barely a foot from him 
and her stral hE on gaze 
caused him to a eyes

answer. Then he giggled.

"You run?" 
"Of course. I wasn 't on my

Both of them could feel the 
tension that'd been mounting 
between them a s t hey 
exchanged hit and miss 
banter suddenly relent, like a 
weight taken off both their 
shou lders. They broke into a 
bevy of giggles like little kids 
and his arm wrapped around 
her waist again , drawing her 
close for another kiss. They 
lingered lip to lip for a 
minute, suddenly aware of 
the softness of each other's 
mout hs. She put a hand 
against his chest and pushed 
away to talk. 

"So now tell me this ," she 
said, her voice like a w hisper, 
"why did you tell me that 
your hands could kill?" 

"Really don ' t know," he 
said, bringing his head back 
so the light would catch his

"maybe just because ] 
thought I would have nothing 
to say and I thought that

myself more interesting to

She smiled, every muscle 
in her face relaxed, thinking 
that he was cute again. And 
somthi ng else besides.

He began to blush and 
lowered hi eyes to his chest . 
She ran a finger over his 
cheek. 

"You seem very sensitive, 
and you seem vulnerable. 
Attractive qualities in a 
man." 

His head still lowered, he 
took his arms from around 
her waist and shoved them 
half-heartedly into his pant 
pockets. He shrugged . 

"I dunno, " he offered, "I 
think I just talk too much and 
I don't fool anyone ..... 

She put a hand on his 
shoulder. 

"Don't be that way," she 
said, "you're attractive and 
you're witty and a charmer. 
You just got nervous." 

"Well, I guess," he offered, 
looking at his watch again, 
"Well, Mary, listen , 1 think I 
better let you get some shut 
eye." When he said this Mary 
noticed how tired she was 
and then nodded sleepily, a 
friendly grin on her face 
spreading as her eyes grew 
heavy. She leaned over and 
kissed him. 

"Doing anything tomor-
row?" he asked. 

"I'm booked up until 9 pm, 
but after that I'm free ." 

"How about dinner at lO?" 
"Alright , lohn," she said , 

"like to meet at the bar?" 
lohn gave her hand a 

squeeze. 

"Great. Same time, same 
station." 

"At ten then." 
"With bells on." They 

embraced once more, kissed 
for a moment, and gave their 
goodbyes, their faces 
following each others' path 
on either side of the door until 
the door was completely shut 
and the latch had clicked. 

Mary leaned against the

sleepiness advancing 
through her body . An

admit when he's gone wrong_ 
Thinking of the files of

through in the morning so 
she'd be fully prepared for the 
afternoon presentation she

"obvious ly a subject for

bothering to complete the 
thought. It'd be interesting to 
see what develops. Yawning 
again, she walked toward the 
bathroom.

Film/Mike Thomas 

Boorman a bore with 'Excaliber' 
reservations about the 
awfulness of the basic 
enterpri e. 

performance creates a wierd 
distance from the film almost 
immediately. 

But at least he has some 
vitality, the actors at the core 
of the film playing Arthur, 
Guinevere and Lancelot are 
like black holes at the center 
of the screen sucking the 

A round Town 

movie into some void. 
Guinevere is dolled up like a 
Penthouse pet , Lancelot 
seems like he was wishing he 
was in California surfing and 
the guy playing King Arthur 
a ts like he was wishing he 
was in another movie, 

There is absolutely no 

engagement in this film, you 
don't care for the characters 
and so spend the near three 
hours walching the pretty 
camera shots and making 
your laundry list . 

Excalibur is showing at the 
Cinerama Theater. 

Director John Boorman is a 
master of mis -en-scene, 
which means for t hose of you 
lucky enough to have escaped 
film classes that he is a visual 
stylist of the highest order. It 
also means the guy couldn't 
tell a story if his life depended 
on it. I have no objections to a 
visually stunning movie as 
long as ' the images on the 
screen are there for some 
other reaSon than to mask 
the fact that the movie is a 
waste of celluloid. 

A movie such as Days of 
Heavm was such a marriage 
of form and content; the 
images were among the most 
breathtakingly beautiful ever 
recorded on film but they 
were also inexorably linked 
to the nostalgic innocnce of 
the pre-World War I period 
that director Terence 
Malick's poetic vision 
demanded. Boorman, in his 
latest offering, Excalibur, 
proves the old adage I learned 
as a mere stripling in film 
school that when a director 
dies he becomes a photo-
grapher. 

When Boorman announced 
plans to film an adaptation of 
Malory's "Le Mort d'Arthur" 
I was somewhat interested 
because at least this time he 
would have total control over 
the project. True [ loathed his 
Zardoz but admired his 
Deliverance and Point Blank 
and , always being the 
charitable chap I am, wished 
his new venture luck. Well, 
sad to say Boorman lives up 
to his name. Excalibur is one 
of the most muddled, tedious 
and confused films to emerge 
in memory. 

'Atnerican Buffalo' here 

[ sort of liked Boorman's 
Tiu Heretic because of his 
total disregard for the turkey 
script he was handed by 
Warners - Richard Burton 
muttering somethin~ about 
getting rid of be ju ju 10 Linda 
Blair - and his decision to 
turn it into a feast for the eyes 
with swarms of locusts and 
dazzling photography 
seducing the eye and 
numbing the critical 

Visually, as I said, the film 
is stunning. Smoky images of 
sixth century England that 
could have emerged from the 
etchings of Gustave Dore 
coupled with a fascination 
with Jungian archetypes 
makes for an intriguing blend 
for the first 20 minutes or so. 
But since the movie is based 
upon myth and legend the 
narrative is crucial and that 
is precisely w here Boorman 
falls apart. His direction of 
the actors is terrible, his 
handling of the story is a 
mess and finally, the visual 
grandeur of the movie works 
against itself by pointing out 
the total inanity of the rest of 
the film . 

Nicol Williamson (one of 
my favorite actors) is 
encouraged to play Merlin as 
an exaggeration and the 
buffoonish nature of the

TlAA gains support frolU athletes 
Attendance doubles at second meeting Monday night 

BY SCOTT ALLISON 
Staff Wriler 

The Triton Intercollegiate 
Athletic Associalion, only 
two weeks old and just 
beginning to take form, met 
for the second time in its 
young history last Monday 
night in order to begin 
accomplishing its goal of 
solidifying the intercollegiate 
sports program at UCSD. 

Approximately sixty 
athletes representing a dozen 
teams attended the meeting, 
a two·fold increase in the 
numbers that attended the 
first TIAA meeting on April 
6. 

Showing support for the 
TIAA and its proposed goal to 
unify UCSD's intercollegiate 

athletics were members of 
teams ranging from sai ling to 
women's softball. Members 
of the UCSD swim team 
outnumbered by far memo 
bers from any other team. 

Specifically, the TIAA 
hopes to olidify alhletics at 
UCSD by : 1) regularly 
bringing together athletes 
from different sports who 
normally would never meet ; 
2) organizing social event 
specifically for intercolle· 
giate ath letes; 3) organizing a 
formal a wards banq uet at the 
end of each year in order to 
acknowledge outstanding 
achievements by individual 
athletes and teams and 4) 
eSlablishing a tradition of 
quality, Division III , non· 

scholar hip school on 
campus and in the communi· 
ty. 

lndt:t:d, in only its lhird 
week of existence, the TIAA 
has some rather lofty goals. 
But most TIAA officials 
agree that the time is ripe on 

thi campu for an organiza-
tion to form with the ole 
intent to instill pride in 
UCSD athletics. 

Volleyball coach Doug 
Dann evi k, one of the 

N etters surprise USIU 
BY BOB McSPADDEN 

Sports Edilor 
The UCSD men's tennis 

team continued its surge 
towards the NCAA Nationals 
on Monday with a urprising 
up et over USIU, 5·4. 

Playing without the power 
of first seed singles player 
John Rosenburg, the Triton 
fell behind usru early in the 
match. Only Peter Wood (7-6, 
1-6, forfeit) and Dave Taber 
(7-5, 3-6, 7-6) managed 
victories for UCSD in the 
singles bracket , Taber 
defeating his opponent 5·4 in 
the tiebreaker of the third et. 

Rosenburg, who missed 
the singles play due to an 
eraRl, was able tg jm.n 

teammate Wood in time for 
their doubles match which 
they won 6·3, 6·2. AI 0 
outstanding in double play 
were the combination of 
Everett Gee and Eugene 
Jones, (6·3, 6·2) while Brad 
Driver and Taber took their 
match, (7-6,6-1). 

USIU had oundly beaten 
the Triton earlier in the 
season, 7-2, and was clearly 
surprised by the upset. As an 
NCAA Division II team USIU 
holds an overall record of 17·5 
against the Tritons Division 
m 15-8 mark. 

Triton Coach Peter Davis 
praised his team for playinl{ 
"outstanding tennis,' 
ighting Taber's tiebreaking 

point a the turning point in 
the match. 

With this victory UCSD i 
assured of a spot in the NCAA 
Nationals over May 12lh to be 
held in Sal bury, Maryland. 
With continued trong play 
the NAlA final will also offer 
the Tritons an invitation to 
Kansas City later next 
month. Davis i optimi tic 
about his squad's chance. 
"The important thing i to 
have a good overall record 
and a good showing in the 
NAIA tournament, " he says. 

UCSD is seeded second 
behind the University of 
Redlands for the NATA 
tourney, which is slated for 
May 7th. 

founding fathers of the TIAA 
along with swim coach Bill 
Morgan and basketball coach 
John Block, believes that 
while the TIAA may have 
gotten off on the right foot , 
the process of attaining the 
goals of the organization may 
take some time. 

"It's not going to be an 
overnight process," Danne· 
vik addressed to the TIAA 
Monday night, "and it's not 
going to be something we 
accomplish by next Quarter 
or by next]anuary. Our goals 
may take a few year to 
develop . It 's just very 
important that we tart 
now." 

Monday night's meeting 
al 0 saw the TIAA move a 

step closer to becoming an 
official student organization, 
as nominations for President, 
Vice-President, Secretary 
and Trea urer were made. 
Swimmers Bob Conlin and 
Tracy Strahl were the only 
two nominated for the office 
of President, a testimony to 
the strong support the swim 
team in particular is giving 
the TIAA. 

Two important items are 
on the TIAA' agenda for this 

pring. One is to set up the 
first annual UCSD Award 
Banquet to take place in late 
Mayor early June. Another 
important item, perhaps even 
more im portant than 
anything the TIAA has done

NOTES FROM 
THE BUDMAN 

It's that time of year again. 
Springtime i upon us and that means 
softball season. Yep folk, another 
overflow of team this pring. We're at 
262 team and counting. Rumor had it 
the Bud man took off for the Virgin 
Islands for a relief from theon laughtof 
teams so he could let the foam settle in 
his mug, so to speak. But not so, the Bud 
man ha been in town disguised as a 
beat reporter covering sports for the 
Guardian. He spent the time at the 
winter trading meetings that meet 
annually in the Pub. YOlt think there 
was wheeling and dealing going on at 
the major league baseball meetings. 
Well...Tom Barman of Men's AAA 
softball's Little Rasca ls, (what 
happened to the Fat Ladys) made Jack 
McKeon look like Charley Finley in his 
stinger days. Tom's team last year 
finished second in AA. Now that is a 
good team, isn't it? At last count the 
Little Rascals had just two bodies off of 
last year's squad. Guess only Avis is 
satisfied with number two. The 
proiOlthJetics last year's defending 
AM Champions did a little trading to 
shore up the loss of half their team. 
They figures they needed some 
infielders with good hands. Well what 
better place to look than University 
Hospital. They signed two future 
surgeons Jerry Waters and Dave 'Gun' 
Laub. If this squad gets many more 
M.D.'s on the team they'll have to 
change the name to the Profomedics. 
The Biohazards of Men's AM lost only 
one ballplayer from last year. But he 
was the only one who knew Fobo. This 
is going to be a tough man to replace. 
Mike Cleary is the new replacement. He 
has spent considerable time in the 
minors before Enos Steinbrenner signed 
him. We hear his hands are so sweet he 
doesn't even have to wear a LaCrosse 
helmet. Dan Montiverde the Women's 
Softball Coach went to Urey Hall home 
of the UCSD Softball Hall of Fame to 
recruit his squad, the Sahara Blues, 
(Sahara Blues?). Scott Harkness, Brad 
Tebo, Dan Montiverde. Fred Galloway 
all made the Hall of Fame on their first 
vote. This is a good squad. One of the 
bigger trades ~as that of the No Nukes. 
They traded their name in and changed 
it to Megatonagg. ) guess they need a 
heftier attack. 

In Coed AA it is like Goliath and 
David. Fobo, last years runaway 
champs went out and picked up a few 
players. To s how the strength o( their 
trades one of their players , Janice Yip. 
had to decide between pro ball, she was 
drafted by the L.A. Dodgers, and 
finishing her education. Well , she 
decided her education come first and 
told Tommy to hold the hugs till later. 
Linda Fogerty is another blue chipper. 
David got a chance but he may have to 
use a tank in lead of a slingshot. 

In Men' AA it should be pretty wide 
open this year with the migration of the 
top AA t am to AAA. Too Cool is back 
from last year' collapse in the playoffs. 
But they 10 t some key players. Their 
draft will have to be watched. 86ed from 
the Pub looks like it had a productive 
winter. Th y did have the advantage of 
using their name literally if their draft 
choices didn 't sign on the dotted line. 
They igned three top draft choices in 
Jim Agronick, Andy OeMayer and Steve 
Balaz. Irving is another Med School 
team. They dropped down from AAA. 
Gee that might not be a bad idea for the 
San Diego Padres. Well anyway Irving 
could be a real sleeper if time hasn't 
worn away their talents and their minds 
don't wander off to the jackpot at the 
end of their schooling. LilliesoftheField 
picked up some solid ballplayers inJeff 
Marks and Keith G,uinn although I hear 
they might be better with a tenni 
racket. 

In Women 's Softball the team Bush 
League eems to have done a super job of 
acquiring talent. They are a new 
expan ion team. But they must have 
fooled the Czars draft disper al system 
when they stole a number of gems from 
the draft. Arlene Koachman is an 
excellent econd baseman. Kathy 
Kozmary can hit the ball a far as 
anyone. 

I'm sure you're wondering what the 
mystique Bud Man's picks will be for 
the year. Well, with all the knowledge he 
acquired at the winter meetings at the 
Pub and brewing over his favorite 
beverage, Budweiser of cour e Larry, 
here are my picks: Men's AAA -Banana 
Slugs. Men's AA · Cum When You Can. 
Men's A - Dic Dic Dic. Coed AA - Fobo. 
Coed A . Hugh Organ and A Couple of 
Nuts. Women's AAA - Brown Sugar. 
Women's AA . The Peppers. 

MIXED TENNIS TOURNAMENT 

The intramural department will be 
offering a Mixed Doubles Tennis 
Tournament for the third time this 
quarter. Actual number of tournaments 
completed is zero. The first was' 
cancelled due to an intercollegiate 
tennis match, the second cancellation 
wa due to our Easter rain shower. So, 
we will try it one more time May 2 & 3, 
and hope that the third time is a charm. 
Sign·ups will be taken anytime up until 
Friday May 1 at noon time in the Rec 
Gym Office. 

OVER·THE·UNE TOURNAMENT 

The Sixth Annual Collegiate Classic 
is this weekend at Fiesta Island. This is 
a great tourney for beginners as well as 
advanced players. Visors will be 
distributed to all participants. There

and Coed play. There is still plenty of 
room, so if you're interested, come sign 
up in the Rec Gym Office.

Water polo \Vins 
First year successful 

BY JIM AGRONICK 
Senior Staff Writer 

In their first season as an 
official intercollegiate sport, 
the women's waterpolo team 
is already following in the 
successful footsteps of the 
other aquatic teams, po ting 
an 8·4 record thus far . 

Competing in the recent 
Anaheim Tournament, the 
Tritons captured first place 
beating both the Stanford 
and UCSB " A" teams. One 
highlight of this tournament 
wa the extremely cIosegame 
with cross-town rival San 
Diego State. The final score 
was 8-7 in favor of SDSU, but 
the UCSD players had to be 
proud of their performance 
against the well established 
State program. 

Two weeks ago , the 
Tritons took third place at 
the Santa Barbara Tourna· 
ment los ing only to SDSU 

and UCSB "A" team. Leading 
scorer for the Triton were 
Vicky Barker and Claudia 
O'Brien, both of whom have 
played in the AAU Women's 
Waterpolo Nationals. Dede 
Steinhoff was also credited 
with a strong performance in 
the goal. 

In their most recent 
matches, the Tritons beat UC 
Riverside 12-1 and Pomona 
15-8. 

Playing time has been a 
problem since the team has 
grown so large but according 
to coaches Dan Crane and 
Dan Eby, there has been 
sufficient interest in the 
program that they are now 
forming two teams - the 
UCSD "A" and "B" teams. 

A UCSD hosted tourna-
ment thi weekend will get 
both teams into action .

Legislature has 
bills on Regents 

continued from page 7 
consists of a single 
paragraph, does not specify a 
minimum limit of stock a 
regent could own before he or 
she would be outlawed from 
serving on the board. 
Theoretically, holding a 
single share of the same stock 
in UC's billion -dollar 
retirement and endowment 
portfolio would disqualify a 
regent under the measure as 
now written. 

Reidhaar raised the 
question of what would 
happen under Brown's bill if 
a governor was disqualified 
from becoming a regent 
because he held the same 
.investments as the Univer· 
sity, even though the 
constitution states the 
governor must receive an ex-
officio seat. 

The bill provides for no 
special provisions for ex-

officio r~ents, those who 
attain their position with UC 
by virtue of their elected 
office and who generally 
serve much shorter terms 
than regular regents. 

Willie Brown himself 
engaged in a spirited fight to 
become an appointed member 
of the Board of Regents, and 
now technically holds two 
seats on the board, He had 
been scheduled for a 
confirmation hearing by a 
Senate panel in March and 
again this month but the 

hearin~ was postponed at 
Brown s request. 

Apparently , some mem-
bers of the powerful Rules 
Committees are balking at 
Brown's appointment, which 
has stirred a controversy 
because the constitution 
prohibits a legislator from 
being named to the board_

nights ago, would be off work 
now and should be waiting at 
the bar for the drink he 
promi ed her last night. 
When the elevator came. he 
walked in and noticed Phil , a 
friend from work whom he'd 
come to the convention with. 
They shook hands, full 
bodied pump -

"How's It going Phil?" 
asked John_ 

Phil looked a little glum. 
"Okay ] guess, but you 

know_ Been here three days 
and I've only gotten a stroke 
or two. and I gotta go home 
day after tomorrow. But you 
know, fuck it. How's this 
place treating you?" 

"Decently, " said John , 
giving Phil an okay sign, 
"G lad] bought that goddamn 
book. That chapter on the 
'new male' and how to use it 
to your advantage seems like 
a good gimmick. At any rate, 
I'll give 'ou full review in a 
couple 0 days." 

"I can hardly wait," said 
Phil, staring at the elevator 
doors, his eyes sad and 
sagging like a beagle's. The 
elevator door opened as John 
gave Phil a nudge in the ribs_ 

"Don't be that way," he 
said, as they walked into the 
Lobby, "you and I come from 
different times and, truth be 
told, the age of the liberated 
male is here and that's what 
women are attracted to now. 
But you'll learn, Phil. you can 
still grow and get in touch 
with your feelings." 

"Maybe I should read that 
book," said Phil , "what's it 
called?" 

"How To Make Love to 
Beautiful Women," he said, 
"I'll drop it by your room 
tomorrow. Anr,way. gotta 
cut. Night Phil. ' 

"Night John," said Phil, 
watching his friend cross the 
Lvoby in wide strides to the 
bar.

Klein's view 
of problem 
a 'repeat' 
continued from page 2 
Palestinian, I am concerned 
with the land of Mandated 

. Palestine, from which my 
family and fri ends wer 
expelled. This ha nothing to 
do with biblical Pale tine and 
to bring up King Solomaon is 
entirely irrevelant. To point 
out that Arab fr om 
Damascu are no different 
than Arabs from afad i al 0 
irrevelant. Arab from 

yrian were not di placed. 
Californian are not 0 very 
different from New Yorker . 
If we kicked all of the 
Californians out of the tate, 
would that mean that they 
had no grievance because, 
what the hell , they could all 
go to New York? 

The letter a erts that 
peace i the only way. It' 
ea y to say thi and ound 
like a wonderful guy. But 
what kind of peace are you 
proposing Spencer Klein? Are 
you suggesting that I accept a 
peace that denies me the 
right to return to my home? 
Are you suggesting a peace 
that allows me to return 
home but require that, 
although I am not Jewi h , J 
live in aJewish state? If so, all 
you are saying i that the 
only way is for Palestinian 
to peacefully accept being 
opre sed. This is no peace at 
all. If on the other hand , you 
are suggesting that all 
Zionists want is to live in 
Palest ine, well, that's fine. 
We never said we were 
unwilling to live «tIHl )e<*s: 
We just have no desire tb Ii e 
in a Jewish state. We're not 
Jewish. We have no desire to 
be di placed from the land 
where we have lived for 
generations. This is theft. 

The worst charge in the 
letter I have saved for la t. I 
cannot believe that anyone 
would seriously print that 
the Arabs cooperated with 
the Nazis. The history books 
imply do not bear this out. 

Arabs from Palestine and all 
over the Middle East fought 
on th .side of the Allied 
Powers against the Axis. 
That there were some 
collaborators is well known. 
But no one accu es the 
French people as a whole of 
being collaborators. Yet there 
were collaborator among 
them. There were collabora-
tor all over Europe. So there 
were a few collaborators in 
the Middle East, too. This is 
hardly the same thing a 
ma s collaboration of the 
Arab people. There is no need 
to print this kind of lander. I 
hope t hat I never have to see 
such slander in print again.
