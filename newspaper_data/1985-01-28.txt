UC involvement in South Africa questioned 
By JANE ROSENBERG, Sacramento Correspondent 

A SERIES OF BILLS aimed at severing California'S ties to the Republic of South Africa is 
expected to include some legislation 
calling on the University of California to 
cut any contacts it may have with the 
South African academic world . 

recent protests against South African 
policies in Washington , DC. in which 
several members of Congress were 
arrested , inspired the current state 
effort. 

economic and academic world is not 
really known. UC Spokeswo~an Valerie 
Sulli van said the UniverSity has no 
student or professor exchange programs, 
no special scholarships and no on-gOing 
research projects concernlllg South 
Africa. 

She added, however, that academic 
departrnents at ind ividual campuses 
aren't prevented from Inviting South 
Africans to teach or study at their 
schools. 

"That's something we have to 
> CONTINUED ON PAGE 9 > A spokesman for Assemblyman Elihu 

Harris CD-Oakland) said the legislator's 
office is preparing a bill to curtail 
research projects. student or professor 
exchanges or fellowship programs uc 
may have in conjunction with the South 
African government. 

"With the binh of the Free South 
Africa Movement around ThanksgiVing, 
we began to see a need to coordinate a 
legislalive approach: said Vincent 
Harris , a lobbyist for the Black 
Advocates in State Service and a 
member of BAPACs international affairs 
committee . 

Bertram to chair MRR 
Mark Harris said the Northern 

California assemblymember is hoping to 
write binding legIslation mandating the 
Regents to stOP all such activity, but 
added he would settle for a non-binding 
resolution. 

The Regents' autonomous status under 
the State Constitutlon normally 
precludes the State Legislature from 
demanding such action. 

"First we have to find out if we can 
have a binding bill," said Harris, the 
assemblyman's chief of staff. "If not, we 
can get this into a resolution bill. 
Resolution bills still have a pretty 
persuasive effect" 

The proposed Harris bill is one of six 
bills and resolutions which either have 
been introduced or are now being 
written in a legislative protest against 
the institutionalized racism known as 
apartheid in South Africa. 

The package is a result of meetings 
between leaders of the Black legislative 
Caucus and -the Black American Political 
Affairs Committee in California. The 

Legislalive aides to the 
assemblymembers introdUcing the bills 
dealing with political prisoners, state 
retirement funds and utility company 
investments view the newfound national 
attention on South Africa as central to 
the package's success, 

"The time is now," said Tyrone 
Netters, a legislative assistant to 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore CD- Los 
Angeles). "The fact of the matter is that 
there's always been a need for 
divestment and anti-apartheid bills in 
the Legislature. BiDs seem to move 
according to the cycle of time, and this 
is such a time." 

The proposed Harris bill, now being 
studied by the Legislative Counsel, is 
representative of the approach anti-
apartheid leaders hope to take-chip 
away at California's State in the current 
South African regime. "This is being 
done on a continuum," Mark Harris 
said. "There are a number of 
approaches, and this is one approach." 

But how deeply involved California 
and UC might be in the South African

The illusion of Christianity 
If you think back to your early youth and consider how many times 

you confronted the idea of whether or not a supreme metaphysical 
being exists, you may discover that your memory has obscured the 
number of different types of conceptions, Pure reason is insufficient to 
describe this phenomenon, which the prophets would define as 
dominance of true faith and which the social scientists would tenn as 
environmental conditioning. The answer most probably lies in that 
shaded gray area called the middle. Though we may hope to self-
rationalize that there is a real conclusion one can come to while mulling 
over the God idea, isn't it a bit foolhardy for an Earth-bound creature to 
be forever debating an infinite existence with a finite mind? Or are 
existential problems a necessity in order to find the good life, and not 
merely a career option for philosophers and monks? 

Everything can arpear profound or be made into some silly 
intellectual jargon i you like, but the fact is that every person is 
religiously defined, whether it be by Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, 
Catholicism, Protestantism, Agnosticism, Atheism, or another religion; 
society gives us no choice. Since we are defined in such a manner, 
shouldn't we be left alone to make our own value judgments and not be 
solicited by groups proclaiming to know the truth? Isn't it enough that 
both religious and non-religious beliefs are mocked every hour as a part 
of social intercourse? Solicitation stifles freedom, erodes culture and 
promotes the very same human insecurities that both religiOUS 
institution and finite philosophers claim they are fighting against. 

We are now brought to the raging debate over the place of organized 
religiOUS solicitation on school grounds. This question should not be 
limited to primary schools, but rather should extend its significance to 
the university. Ironically, our current crop of evangelists have yet to 
attempt to institute a law requiring a prayer period in public 
universities; their thesis rests on the belief that we should be worshiping 
their God because it is by His design that we were chosen to be 
lectured at in the classroom. 

Since we have spared this exercise , our primary focus should then be 
the banning of the despotism that exists in great force on our own 
campus. For there is a specific religiOUS majority at UCSD that emulates 
the mood of the nation , that which practices the cloak and dagger 
approach: the peachy, preachy illusionists. 

When the road to "heaven" is paved by deceptive gestures, one 
begins to doubt the sincerity of the constructing crew. Andre Kole, 
showman, magician and evangelist of national repute, will bring his 
"world of illusion" to UCSD February 2 courtesy of the Campus Crusade 
for Christ' (Ccq. As reponed by this news-magazine in "Cross Section" 
on January 24, the CCC requested funding for this debacle from the AS 
Council without clearly explaining that the astounding feats that Mr. 
Kole will perform will be tainted with highly religiOUS ovenones. As it 
turned out, the CCC's request for funding was rebuffed by the AS upon 
notification of Mr. Kole's true identity by a student observer. Cloak your 
dagger with blinding lights and smiling assistants (read: CCC), and then 
thrust your double-edged point home. 

Obviously, the CCC is not satisfied with lying to the AS Council and 
thereby disgracing themselves in front of the rest of the student body. 
No one is surprised, though, for recruitment technicians have never 
been known to be highly principled. So off they scoot to Revelle Plaza to 
sell tickets for this modem-day Merlin at $4 and $5 dollars per prey. 
They sit paiiendy on their little pulpits showing videos of Kole, a self-
proclaimed man of God doing his fantastical illusions. On video. A 
demagogue on a mesmerizing screen. 

This morbid satire of supposedly graced children soliciting students 
to fund a type of evangelism born of deception must end. Tell us, who 
is playing the pan of the Devil in this case? Has the Campu~ Crusade 
for Christ forgotten that integrity is a state of being that cannot be 
turned on and off whenever it is convenient? 

The AS Council is considering cutting all funding to religious 
organizations on campus. An act of this magnitude would completely 
sever the existing relationship between church and state here in La Jolla 
on the hill. Maybe it's for the better. Maybe it will be an instructive 
lesson for those Crusaders who should practice what they preach, Not 
that the First Amendment shouldn't be upheld at an times, for it should, 
and freedom of worship is an intrinsic part of it 

But let's put freedom back where it belongs. Back to its most wonhy 
fonn: the realm 01 individual choice where a person decides for herself 
the validity of religiOUS faith , institutions, and self, without at the same 
time having to fend off manipulative angels.

toward "Alcoholism IS wrong, but that's 
okay. It's allowed to be wrong," I would 
like to Ulke this opportunity [0 elaborate, 
for the record . and for the benefit of 
any confused freshmen resulting from 

your article. 
The students of UCSD in general 

have a much more extensive knowledge 
of the ab& of alcohol and other drugs 
than is aprarent in your article. Being a 
member 0 said group (UCSD students), 
I should know, and therefore I must be 
right. You see, we , as students, have no 
qualms about abusing such substances. 
In fact, we put it very high on our 
prionty list of things to do. What ould 
be better on a Friday mght than an 
evening of mindless partying? (If you 
said think or learn , Ulke two steps 
backward, emon, it 's bad enough you 
ask us to think during classes, Now you 

want us to use our mind during our olf-
time, too!) 

To address some of your points in 
order: 

1) You are right, we do often hear the 
statement "Escaping your problems 
through a bmtie is no cure." But is that 
really true? If problems disappear while 
you are senselessly drunk, but come 
back as mean and nasty as ever when 
you sober up, does that reany suggest 
avoiding sobriety? Hmm. 

2) You suggest that the presence of 
alcohol in the system may alter a 
person's perceptions and change the 
context of his actions. Then you ask, 

"Can we possibly accuse someone of 
committing a foolish act as a direct 
result of having an excess amount of, or 
lack of, alcohol in their bodies?" 
Absolutely! And a wonderful point it is, 
too_ In (act, if we were aU drunk, aU the 
time, no one would ever commit a 
foolish act , or even be responsible for 
any o( their actions. Think of an the 
anxieties that would eliminate! 

3 ) You affinn thaI lhe reason for 
drinking is that somewhere in the 
person's psyche , they are miserable. 
What a rude thing to say. No, actually I

Dh you Grim, GRIM Reaper!! 
By SEAN WAGSTAFF , 

Up until Friday, I thought I had a pretty good sense 
o( humor. That is, until death knocked on my door for 
the sixth time in less than that many months. 

move, which all seemed like reasonable advice to me, 
so I have always followed it. 

again will I plug quaners in a meter, buy a pennit or 
put money in a heinous, bloody envelope from Hades. 
The UCSD police have seen the laSt of my pitiful, 
desperate pleas for forgiveness and sucked the last of 
my already-thin blood. 

The Grim Reaper is a horrible spectre. But it is not 
the look of death that has forever altered my view of 
life. It is the utter helplessness, the frustration, the 
incredible sense o( loss that can be understood only by 
those whose lives have been touched by this merciless 
visitor. 

Many people I know have gone through life 
indifferent to death. But there are those, like me, who 
walk in constant fear and loathing of Him. My waking 
houB are haunted by the chance of His appearance. 
My work is hindered by Him. I cannoc cross the 
campus for an interview without expecting Him to 
descend upon me at any instant. No longer wiD I walk 
my girlfriend to the door, from fear that He is hiding 
just around the comer. I had even gone so far as to 
SlOp driving to school, knowing, fearing, aD-too 'oven, 
that my compact car would make the perfect death 
trap. Up until Friday, that is, 

It was 11:30 on a Thursday night when Grim Reaper 
-5 came to visit me, I was parked in (ront of the 
Warren Apartments against an unmarked curb 
alongside a strip of pavement roughly the width of 
Interstate 5. My date and I were out of my car for at 
least ten minutes before I returned and turned on the 
windshield wipers to remove the condensation from 
the glass. There it was, waving its ugly white rectangle 
in my face, mocking me. Laughing at me for thinking I 
was safe at such an ungodly hour. Even my romantic 
life must live in the shadow of death . 

And to those "parking control officers" who 
complain that they are verbally abused on a daily basis. 
that they are harrassed and threatened , I suggest they 
find another job. Death will always illicit (ear and 
hatred. But to those who plan to continue stalking the 
woods of UCSD in their black cloaks and blue shins,J 
offer this plea on behalf of the innocent at heart: If you 
must write the ticket, please make it a $10 and not a 
$16 one. So I have reached the ultimate conclusion, Never 

Doonesbury 

Friday would have been a day much like any ocher, 
I suppose. I had not slept in close to 48 hoUB. A 
paper was due. Twenty minutes before the deadline, I 
pulled the last sheet (rom the Royal. I was simply too 
tired to be afraid that morning. I drove to school and 
dropped off my paper. Then I went to the Guardian 
office. My head was swimming (rom need of sleep. I 
made a phone caD, I checked my mail. Nothing. Then 
a horrible feeling of dread fl:.JShed the skin of my face. 
That noise, that noise! I'd heard it only a few times 
before. Usually He worked so silently. I ran to my desk 
and picked up a small pink card without stopping. I 
threw open the door .. , there He was, not the same as 
I remembered Him. This time His skin was blacker, 
But oh, it was Him alright. This time it wasn't my 
friends He had come (or, it was 1M. 

I ran, screaming, to my car, But it was too late. I 
looked at Him, pleading, teaB streaming down my 
face . But His mouth, His eyes, His long sinewy fingers 
and His shirt, that horrible blue shirt that He always 
wore, were covered, dripping with blood, my blood! 
And I looked down at my chest and saw only a gaping, 
tattered, lifeless hole where once my hean and lungs 
had been. I (ell to my knees, clutching the only 
posession I had left in the world, and died. 

I am still holding Parking Citation #0309132, and I 
am not laughing. I laughed off the first four. I told 
myself that they would be the last and I paid them. 

But then came -5. It has been trampled on the floor 
of my car so many times that I'm afraid to pick it up, 
for (ear that it may have gained a Ii(e of its own. An 
ironic possibility for the thing that ,Pve me my first 
real taste o( death. Number five really hun the most, I 
think. It's just that -6 was so close on its heels that my 
mind simply snapped from disbelief. 

When I was young, my father told me it was proper 
to walk a girl 10 her door after a date, and my friends 
all convinced me that it was the best time to make my

Cover story 

AS casts religion into a world of illusion 
By CHRISTOPHER CANOLE 
"W HATEVER YOUR feelings 

are individually or as a 
group, we are taking a 

stand on funding religious organizations 
on campus," said Student Activities Fee 
Commisioner Jill Lifschiz . 

Lifschiz's comment opened the AS 
Council's debate on both funding CCC 
$2,290 to bring the iUusionist/ evangelist 
Andre Kole to UCSD and as to whether 
such action would constitute an 
infraction of the UCSD by-laws 
regarding religious activities on campus. 
"This is a grey area, a personal and 
touchy area. Whatever we do tonight , 
we do across the board and we have to 
be consistent in our definition of where 
we draw the line as to funds to allocate 
or underwrite . If we don't underwrite 
the Andre Kole program, we don't 
underwrite anybody," Lifschiz said. 

AS President Marc Boroditsky said, 
"We know this organization will have 
no problem paying back this underwrite . 
But we are not looking at the financial 
situation here. We're looking at the 
program itself. We should not look at 
whether the organization (CCC),should 
receive operational funds ; that is. 
another controversial subject that has 
arisen. We should consider the program 
in light of the existing regulations for 
UCSD ." 

Boroditsky read into the record the 
University of California Policies and 
UCSD Campus Regulations applying to 
Campus activities, organizations and 
students: 

"As a State instrumentality, the 
University must remain neutral on 
religious and political matters. The 
University cannot sponsor or fund 
religiOUS activities, or sponsor or fund 
political activities, except when 
authorized by the Regents or the 
President or their designees. Religious 
and political campus organizations shall 
have access to University propenies on 
the same basis as all other campus 
organizations, according to guidelines 
set fonh in campus regulations." 

"A student organization'S activity will 
be defined as "religious' if: The activity 
is viewed by the organization as 
"religious;" if the purpose of the activity 
is worship, devotion , prayer or study of 
religious literature (e.g., Bible/ Koran); if 
membership m, or affiliation with, a 
group gener.dly recognized as a religious 
sect is criterion for panicipation; or if 
the purpose of the activity is to bring 
together persons professing-their belief 
in God or other belief encompassing 
theories of man's nature or place in the 

universe and occupying a place in 
members lives comparable to recognized 
religion ." 

Campus Crusade for Christ's Randy 
jones presented an Andre Kole 
videotape to the council, which is also 
being used daily in the Revelle Plaza to 

,promote the Feb. 2 perfonnance. In the 
tape the narrator states, "Using his 
techniques of illusion, Andre Kole will 
show how he realized his relationship 
with God." 

After playing the tape, Jones defended 
so me accusations 
made in the previous 
AS Council meeting. 
"You guys don't want 
it to be a religiOUS 
circus, neither do we. 
This man is not 
brother Jed I famous

who addressed the issue with a written 
statement to the AS Council. 

"The Union of Jewish Students ana 
the L'Chayim quanerly are opposed to 

. the funding of Andre Kole as requested 
by the Campus Crusade for Christ. 

"The ethnic and cultural aspect of the 
UJS has always been respected by the 
AS. UJS is an organization which brings 
together Jewish students here at UCSD. 
It does not attempt to preach religious 
views, and it is opposed to the practice 
of proselytization. Similarly, L'Chayim is 

not a religious or 
proselytizing maga-
zine . It IS an 
education newspa-
per available to the 

Jewish community at 
UCSD and to the 
student body as a 
whole . Therefore, we

citizens in the world 
he thinks are

much animosity, we 
don't see how you 

. can tum this down 
and not tum down 
the funding or 
underwriting of 
aClivities by any 
other religious 
organization." 

The council 's 
discussion of fund-
ing the perfonnance 
also came to the 
attention of the 
Union of Jewish 
Students and the 
L'Chayim quanerly 
campus newspaper, 

- AS President Marc Boroditsky 

"Hardly a year goes 
by that we don't 
receive a protest in 
response to the show. 
This is a cyclic thing_ " 
-a representative of 

Andre Kofe 
Productions 

also feel that a 
distinction must be 
made between the 
funding of an 
organization which 
tries to proselytize 
religious doctrine on 
o thers, a nd the 
funding of our 
organ izations which 
serve as a cultural 
focal point for the 
Jewish students at 
UCSD." 

Commissioner Lif-
schiz commented on 
the letter, "The major 
concern of mine , 
unlike my fellow Jews 
on the letter we just 
received, is that I 
have carefully consi-
dered this as a 
member of AS 
council, as student

and as a jew. I see this as suppon of a 
student organization that is bringing 
somebody on campus. That suppon 
being that we are enhancing the right of 
the student organization to exist and 
flourish on campus." 

Many council members expressed 
concern as to how much of the 
illusionist progra m would be dedicated 
to evangelism. Jones produced a chan 
explaini ng the "Magic and Reality" 
performance. The first 45 minutes will 
be purely an illusionist show. Kole will 
then give a five-minute warning that 
later in the program there will be an 
evangelistic segment. After a ten-minute 
intermission, the show would continue 
with 20 more minutes of magic, 
followed by another "varning. Then 
during a five-minute intermission, those 
not waming to panicipate in the 
evangelistic segment would have the 
opportunity to leave. 

In this week's Reader, a discrepancy 
in jones chart came up. "When pressed 
for details, Tony Hoang (CCC) admitted 
that while the bulk of Kole's show 
consisted of legerdemain, Kole would 
also speak to the audience about 'his 
personal relationship with Jesus Christ.' 
This, Hoang said, would be done five 
minutes before intermission and at the 
end of the show." Jones had not 
informed the council of any evangelistic 
statements during the warnings. 

Bob Dorsch. of Andre Kole 
Productions, clarified the format of the 
program. "The five-minute warning 
period includes a two- to three- minute 
talk about an experience that changed 
the course of his life ." 

Dorsch said. "At the end of the tWO 
magic show parts, anybody in the 
audience who is not interested in Andre 
Kole's testimonial to God. or feels they 
would be offended , will have one 
minute, not five mmutes to leave." 

The CCC expects the performance to 
sell out the 800 seating capaci ty of 
Mandeville Auditorium. The CCC would 
not estimate what portion of that 800 
would want, or be able , to leave in that 
one minute . 

As to the council's action on the 
funding , Dorsch said, "Hardly a year 
goes by that we don't receive a protest 
in response to the show. This is a cyclic 
thing. I n the '60s, rrotests over the 
evangelistic pan 0 the program were a 
major problem." 

Those sixties attitudes may have 
accounh:d for UC Berkeley banning all 
funding (e ither allocations or

Battle brews over faculty salary hikes 

SBPC discusses questionable salaries 
By JANE ROSENBERG. Sacramento Correspondent 

U NIVERSITY OF CALIFORNlA's senior vice resident for academic aNairs has warned the 
Student Body Presidents' Council (SBPC) 
against using a recent University study 
to lobby against a proposed faculty 
salary hike. 

William Frazer asked the 16 members 
of the council, which sets policy for the 
UC Student Lobby. to postpone any 
action until the University can confirm 
or deny the results of the survey. The 
study. conducted by the Oakland-based 
Institute for Research in Social Behavior, 
showed faculty hours devoted to 
instructional activities dropped from 
27.5 per week in 1982-83 to 26 in 
1983-84. 

"I hope you will regard this in the 
same way we do, that this has to be 
investigated , before you do anything." 
Frazer said. "If you take this up, you are 
dealing with some of the most vicious 
people around , o ur faculty members." 

UC STUdent Lobby Director Ron 
Balestrieri pointed to the survey, which 
the University has been conducting 
since 1977, as evidence of a possible 
decline in the buying power of student 
education dollars, and suggested that 

STUdents only support a portion of a 
proposed salary hike. 

Both Gov. George Deukmejian, in his 
Sta te of the State Address and in his 
budget released laSl week, and the 
University are calling for an 8 .8% hike 
for professors-an increase which 
would keep their salaries slightly above 
the average salary at eight comparable 
institutions. 

Frazer said UC President David 
Gardner has asked individual 
chancellors to confirm the results of the 
study, which also showed that hours 
devoted to scheduled course Instruction 
have declined from 5.7 per week in 
1981-82 to 5.5 in 1982-83 and 5.l in 
1983-84. 

Frazer said he could offer no real 
rationale for the decline, but speculated 
that an increase in enrollment is forcing 
faculty members to teach larger lower-
division courses while giving up 
seminars and upper-division courses. 
He also suggested that professors 
reported working fewer hours in the 
classroom at the beginning of laSt 
academiC year, when morale was low 
due to budget cuts . 

Frazer told SBPC that if the UC

THE FUTURECOPV PLACE 

Student Lobby used the repon to work 
against the salary increase , "it would be 
the most difficult thing you would take 
on this year." He added that such action 
would be "incredibly counterproductive" 
and promised that UC administrators 
would investigate the decline. 

During an informal discussion before 
Frazer's presentation , student leaders 
suggested using the results of the study 
in negotiations which could lead to the 
re-establishment of a systemwide 
minimum SlUdent wage. 

The minimum student wage was 
eliminated in 1981-82, and students at 
several campuses, such as Santa Barbara 
and Davis. have had to take pay cuts 
since then. SBPC members lean toward 
re-establishing the minimum wage but 
with some fleXibility so students at the 
more expensive campuses, such as Los 
Angeles where the cost of living is 
higher, might earn more money. 

With an 8 .8% increase this year, UC 
faculty salaries will "far surpass [he 
salaries of any workers in this state ," 
Balestrieri said when arguing that 
students use the report as a bargaining 
chip with administrators. 

The effect the report would have in 

the State Legislature, which will consider 
the salary increase as pan of a proposed 
S1.6 billion allocation to UC this year, 
would be minimal, Frazer said . 

"I'm not particularly worried the 
Legislature will independently pick up 
on it:' he said after meeting with 
students. 

But Frazer said he would "hate to see 
us gel into a confrontational posture 
with the Legislature" over the report, 
which costs UC approximately S200,000 
each year. 

Frazer said the University expects to 
collect all data concerning the decline 
by March, but was uncenain whether 
UC will present another report-or just 
add to the old survey. 

He added that Gardner's office would 
have inveSligated survey results if they 
showed another "statistically Significant" 
increase in instructional hours . "If there 
was a sudden change of any sort, we 
would investigate it," he said. 

SBPC Chairwoman Kayleen Kott said 
the council will take up the issue at its 
FebruaJY meeting, after an SBPC 
committee reviews the information. "1 
think we'll support the salary increase," 
she said. ~

investigate," Mark Harris said, admitting 
that the assemblyman's office is also 
uncenain what academic ties exist. if 
any. The lack of information 
surrounding the issues extends to other 
matters on the anti-apartheid agenda . 

"The information isn 't secret, but we 
juSl don't have it." Vincent Harris said. 
"Most of this will come OUI at committee 
hearings. We'll be providing a forum for 
the information to be disclosed ... to the 
public." 

Harris' bill will probably be 
introduced in the next three weeks. Two 
bills and one resolution in the package 
have already been formally introduced. 
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los 
Angeles) has written Assembly Bill 134, 
which would prevent new state funds 
from being invested in any bank with 
loans to the South African government, 
or in any company doing business in 
South Africa 

Waters proposed the same measure 
laSl year, when the bill failed to win the 
approval of the Assembly Finance. 
Insurance and Commerce Committee by 
one VOle . 

Waters has also written Assembly 
Joint Resolution 5, which cans on South 
Africa to free all political prisoners. The 
only other bill yet to be introduced is 
Senate Bill 9, authored by State Sen. Bill 
Greene (D-Los Angeles), which would 
prohibit inveSling public employee 
retirement funds in banks with business 
in South Africa and establish a five-year 
period for divesting funds from so-
called "dirty" banks. 

Greene originally proposed diveSling 
retirement monies laSljanuary. but 
failed to bring the bill up for ·a 

committee hearing. An aide to Greene 
said the senator's decision to re-
introduce the bill indicates he will bring 
it up for a he<!ring this session . 

Bills yet tp be introduced include: 
• A resolution asking Californians to 
stop purchasing Krugerands, gold coins 
produced in South Africa. 
Assemblywoman Theresa Hughes (D-Los 
Angeles) is consideri ng this bill as well 
as a measure asking the California State 
University system to divest. 
• A bill asking aU California utility 
companies to divest from banks and 
businesses with investments in South 
Africa. Netters said he is uncenain how 
many utility companies would be 
affected by Assemblywoman Moore 's 
proposal. "That's pan of the dilemma," 
he said. 

Vincent Harris, a former Black 
Students Alliance president at UClA 
and campu~ coord inator for the UC 
Student LoIiby, admitted securing 
passage for the divestment bills is 
difficult, bur is made easier when 
accompanied by non·binding 
resolutions. which may generate enough 
heat to win over legislators wooed by 
bankers' lobbies. 

The Student Body Presidents' Council 
has already endorsed AB124 and SB9, 
and will probably consider Harris' bill 
when it is completed , UC Student Lobby 
Director Ron Balestrieri said. 

Balestrieri added he doesn't foresee 
the Harris bill impinging on academic 
freedom , saying. "I don 't think there 's an 
academic freedom issue involved with a 
country that is so blatantly racist: ~

religIOUS organization on campus. 

"The Associated Students recognize 
and sponsor six religiOUS organizations 
on campus. Regardless of the program, 
we sponsor them and give them money. 
Since we s ponsor their [CCC's J existence, 
we are sponsoring the event," said 
Lifschiz on UCSD's present situation. 

After Boroditsky asked the council 
how they should interpret the UC 
regulations' definition of a religiOUS 
activity, Lifschlz continued , "As Marc 
has said, we have opened the can of 
worms on the funding of religious 
organizations on campus. We opened it 
because we have been doing it in the 
past. We are not really start ing anything 
new; the question is, are we gOing to 
cont inue funding or do we end what we 
already do?" 

The council voted seven in favor and 
nine in opposition to fundi ng the 
Campus Crusade for Chnst program. 
Several council members comme nted 
afterwards they expect the AS Council 
will begin looking further into the 
funding and activities of religious 
organizations on ampus. 

"I think the religiOUS issue has been 
brewing for quite a time," said 
Boroditsky. ''Twice last year funds were 
dbused by these organizations. The first 
step we are planning is J more exa tlng 
gu ideline defini tion of religious and 
non-religiOUS activities In the by-laws of 
the new AS Constitution. Since Berkeley 
has had much more experience in 
facing the Issue, we may use their 
example as a gUideline." ~

Rubbing off the rough edges 
By INGRID GREENBERG 

I KNOCK AND WAIT I will soon be t.lkmg my lothes on in this unfamiliar apat1ment The door 
opens Dorns, a freckle-faced UniversllY 
student, mtrodu es herself and tells me 
Kim IS dOing her laundry. uddenly, 
without warning, a grey cat pounces on 
m)' leg, takes a bIte into my jeans and 
bolts away. tanding in her jogging SUit, 
Dorris shakes with laughter, happy for 
the relief from stud)~ng Fren h. Kim, 
the masseuse, says hello, how ale you, 
and says she has to run downstairs to 
put 50C in the washing machine . Since 
the lIght bulbs have burned out In the 
hvmg room , I am invited to waI[ In 
Kim's bedroom. 

Books. newspapers, poster, pens and 
pencils clutter her room. A close 
eXJlmnation reveals her interests In 
vegetananIsm, massage and general 
health. Signs on her wall read , "Live and 
Let live" and "Vegetarianism IS Good 
for Life ." And, much like do ·tors who 
display diplomas In their waItIng rooms, 
a "Touch for Health" cenificate hangs a 
Imle askew In a simple black frame 
above her bookshelf. Two large posters 
chaning the muscular and bone 
structure of the human body lean 
against the wall . 

The cat stalks Into the room. He 
Jumps intO a pile of clot hes and 
crouches low. Just as his squinting eyes 
m.lrk a bulls-eye on me, Kim walks In to 
save me from another surpnse attack. 
Wearing well-worn blue Jeans and a t-
shm dlsfla~ng a faded Silk-screen 
photO 0 a cat, Kim piCks up Rox)', the 
ambusher. Kim , who Isn 't wearing any 
cosmetics, exudes a natural and pretty 
appearan e. Her clean, smooth skin 
shines under a head of feathered hair. 

Who is this woman who sets up shop 
In a mess)' bedroom between laundry 
loads? 

A year after graduatIon from 
Pennsylvania State With a Bachelor of 
Ans degree in mUSIC, Kim moved to 
California because she heard that 
people who h\'e here are sensitive to 
holIstIC mediCine, vegetananism and 
animal nghts 

Iler deCision to learn massage has 
forced her IntO a dilemma She attends 
massage courses, but they cost her more 
money than her personal funds can 
sU ppOrt. So, she works Illegally for a 
massage parlor-she still doesn 't have a 
license to work in San Diego COUnty. 
Once she commits herself to the parlor, 
she finds middle-age male custOmers 
asking her for sexual fdvors as if she 
were a pros(I[ute. These are "respectable 
bUSInessmen" who entenain the Idea 01 
prostitutIon during their lunch hour. 

. Kim has learned qUickly that her 
Idealized verstOn of progressive attitudes 
In California are only panly true . As .01 
fema le , she must cope With 3exual 
hJr.olssment that threatens to end her 
career a~ a prore~slUnal masseu e. Back 
In her own apanment, Kim only invites 
(lients she can trust not to heg for an 
erotIc massage 

Kim shoos Roxy OUt of the small 
bedroom and unfolds her portable table , 
then pulls twO white sheets out of the 
pile In the laundry basket. One heet is 
still damp-she decides that If I lie on 
tt, my body warmth WIll dry It. As she 
evens-out the edges, she asks If I have 
any physical handicaps thilt might 
prevent her from giving me a full -body 
massage. Then she discusses with me 
which massage I would prefer. She 
explains both Swedish and Esalen 
massages will leave me refreshed and 
energetiC although , the Esalen ma sage 

requIres slower hand movements. I 
choose a full-bod), SwedIsh massage . 

Let the soothing expenen c negin . To 
gain m)' confiden e, her hands lift my 
neck and head ofT the table. As Kim 
turns m)' head ever 0 gemly, I tense a 
moment and strain my neck muscles. 
then I succumb and let my head fall 
into her strong hands. This is my hour. 
I sleep, I talk, I daydream. I laugh or I 
lie quietly. She rubs oil. pushes, pulls 
and rubs over nearly every inch of my 
melting body. 

Kim has strong and confident hands 
and a natural talent for therapeutiC 
massage. Why, then, does she work 
three days a week at a massage parlor 
notorious for 5<ltisfying sexual requests? 

Kim arrived In San Diego In her 
Honda during the muggy month of 
August. She found a vegetarian 
roommate and mOl'ed into her modest 
apanment In PaCific Beach. Nearly 
broke, Kiln scanned the classified ads of 
The Reader Someth ing caught her eye. 
"Masseuse wanted, no experience 
neceS5al)', will train. Call Gibson." 
Gibson taught her a few strokes the 
same day she called him, but he held 
off on hiring Kim immediately. 

Meanwhile, Kim pursued a more 

conventIonal type of massage tmmmg. 
he attended courses at the Institute of 

Psychology and Structufdl BalanCing, 
IPSB. There Kim found a group that 
shared her holistic approa h to health 
care . Occupying the second noor ahove 
a Rexall drugstore In PaCific Beach, IPSB 
trainS people for aU levels of massage. 
IPSB's warm and Inviting ambience 
appealed to Kim's perception of an ideal 
learning center. 

Most students take only one trlme~ter 
of course~; JUSt enough to prepare for 
the massage technician exam given at 
the County Health Administration 
BUilding. Kim says her previous training 
III he,llth C.olf(' allowed her to pass this 
exam With e.lse , even though she has 
yet to IInlsh her nasic courses at IPSB. 
Now she awaits the arrival of the 
lIcense while the Department of Jus[Ice 
does d rout me check to sce If she hJS J 
Criminal bdCkground. Kim ~ceks the 
more advanced mle "massage themplst," 
an .lccredltatIOn accepted in any area In 
the United tates. After nine to 12 
months, $3,595 and 1000 hours of 
rubbing, pulllllg, puShlIlg, dancing, 
studying and meditating, KIm WIll wke a 
more rigorous eX<.lm . With J m<.l sS.olge 
therapIst accreditation, she may find a 
job With a hiropractor, on a "love boat," 
or at a gym. ow she IS leamIng T'al 
Chi , psychological caliS thenics, Swedish 
and Esalen massage and body 
psychology 

After tWO weeks of the IPSB CQu r!>C , 

Kim received .01 phone call from Glb on . 
Kim took the job even though her 
massage technician license had nO! yet 
come in the mail. Without rhe license, 
she knows she is working illegally for 
Gibson, but she says it is wonh the risk 
because she needs to make money to 
pay the rent. 

By law, a masseuse can't work out of 
her house, even if she has a license . But 
Kim makes an exception to massage 
preferred clients in her home until she 
receives her lice nse and enough 
clientele to support the rem of a private 
mom in a massage parlor. 

The first time I met Kim she asked 
me not to use her real name for fear the 
vice squad might locate her at the salon. 
She would not tell me where she worked 
,IS a masseuse, si nce she said a police 
raid would Jeopardize her career as a 
professional masse usc. During a second 
interview, nO! only did she prOVide 
revealing details, but she said she would 
'"love to close 'em down," 

Why th is sudden shift in attitude 
toward Gibson's salon? 

"I almost feel like a prostitute. If you 
saw where I work. I work on mostly 
older men . They have expectations that 
I won'r fulfill . Sometimes I do soft touch 

massage and that rums them on . Isn't 
that what prostitutes do? We have good 
hands at Gibson's, so men return to us. 
Other places have good sex, but no 
hands. I tell them to marl)' a masseuse 
if they want both." 

They usually ask at the end of the 
seSSion , 'Hey, do you do ... ?' and 
Instead of finishing they look at you 
and expect more . Some say, 'Come here. 
I'U tell you a secrer.' A secret ... but 
there 's only twO people in the room. I'm 
sure. If you go dose enough they will 
kiss you. But I never fall for that one. 
Usually they look at you a~ if you forgot 
something. It 's all very subtle 

"Some men are willing to give me 
5 I 00 for sexual favors ... they wallt me to 
play wi th their bodies .. it 's 
frust!'"..ltIng ... 1 only want to give them a 
massage and talk to them. I don't have a 
penIS :.0 I don 't understand their 
deSire. 

When compared to progressive 
thinkers In the holistic medicine 
movement, these men are certai nly not 
01 our tImes. RJther than respect the 
masseuse's sk ill and talent , these men 
treat women as sexual objects, mere 
receptacles of corporeal indulgences. 

She explains men have many 
difTerenr stt'Jtegles for tl)'ing to convi n e 
her that the inner thighs and buttocks 
need more massage than usual. Some 
men complain about prostate problem . 
Others say the penis is lIke any other 
p,1t1 of rhe body and It deserves 

attentton too. They try a little 
psychology by blaming her "impersonal 
treatment" for their depression . Kim 
usually fights ofT their persistant 
requests. However, on occasion, she'll 
agree to rub the guy's inner thigh for 
'JUSt one more minute." Under the 
constant financial and emotional 
pressures , Kim finds it difficult to say 
no all the time. 

The slow rhythmiC hand movements 
on my back come to a slow stop. To 
invigorate my muscles, she gently slaps 
the backs of m)' legs and arms. I shake 
my head and take a deep breath . Scents 
of amber fill my nostrils. Kim leaves the 
room while I get dressed and prepare 
my rested body to stand up. 

When she comes back in the room , 
Kim asks how I feel and says she feels 
good too. She says she foltnd that 
knotted muscle in my back and gave It 
extra attention. "I go by feelings usually 
when I work on somebody. I work better 
if I don'r think abum It." 

Money does not preoccupy Kim's 
mind tonight. It is understood that as a 
student I pay only $25 instead of the 
regular $30 fee. When I'm $2 shon, she 
asks if I would write comments in her 
log in lieu of paying the difference . She 
says the feedback and critIcism help her 
refine the techniques she learns at IPSB. 

'" I want to know many techniques. I 
only know Swedish massage now. Some 
people only take one quaner of 
instruction and go make money. I still 
want to take more T'ai Chi and other 
classes. 

"I wam to be able to look at 
somebody and say, This is what's wrong 
with you. You'll need ten sessions, so 
sign up.''' 

How does Kim cope with the ethical 
and legal colltrddictions posed by her 
work at Gibson's salon? Kim says she 
justifies illegal massaging because she 
needs to earn the money and "it's great 
work experience." At Gibson's salon, 
Kim 's clie nts usually ca re more about 
sex than their health though . Kim says 
Gibson implicitl), encourages hi s 
masseuses to perform sexual favors. He 
instructs masseuses not to give extras, 
but baSI-ally he Just looks the other wa y. 

KIm has her own theories about these 
male customers. She explains, "They 
think the same way that that sayi ng 
goes. You know, you've heard of the 
good worrran , the bad woman and the 
dumb woman saying. The good woman 
is the wife who stays home , the bad 
woman is the prostitute who does it for 
money and, the dumb woman is the 
one who does it for free. That's their 
whole attitude. 

"Last week Gibson fired a girl who 
W<lS giving extras. Deep down inside he 
could care less. But the cops could close 
him down If word got out abour the 
extras. He's already illegal since he hires 
people like me who don't have a 
license. 

ow he 's saylllg he'll let people go if 
they have a low return rJtc. One girl 
only has an 8% re turn mte . Then there 's 
this other girl who's pretty sman. She 
takes names from the frollt of the log 
book and writes theIr names down for 
the new clients and it looks like she has 
a hl,lth return rate ." 

The pres ures of ,I high return rate 
have consequently forced Kim and 
another frustrated co-worker to speed 
up plans to open a business 
llldependent of Gibson . They are 
investigating the pos ibllity of opening ,I

Dropping back to punt 
By PHIL lAUDER 

Dropping. 
It's an ugly word . 
Probably the worst thing about 

dropping classes is that the option to 
do so exists. Life would be much 
simpler and less stressful if we didn't 
have the choice. Think about it: If once 
you signed up for a class you knew it 
was yours until death did you pan, 
maybe-just maybe-you'd take the 
damn thing seriously from the outset. 
Maybe you'd do the readings on time-
maybe you'd do the readings period-
maybe you'd even tum in assignments 
and go to lectures and participate in 
discussions and do all the things a 
srudent is supposed to do. 

Maybe, 
This is the founh week of the quarter, 

which means that you aD have until 
Friday to decide whether you're going to 
drop back in punt formation and bail 
out of a class now or roll the dice and 
hope it doesn'r come up "W." Or worse. 

Somewhere in the middle of those 
twO extremes lie the majoriry of us-the 
people who are taking between 12 and 
18 units this quarter and are just hating 
life in that one class. 

Decision '85. 
1 dropped my first class ever one year 

ago this quaner. It hurt. It hun a lot. I'd 
made it all through high school and half 
way through college without even 
considering to drop a class, but it was 
just a matter of postponing the 
inevitable. Your first drop is like your 
first love-you never forget it. Mostly 

when you're not uSed to the ferociry 
with which his epithets are hurled . 
"What the heD is your problem, 
anyway?" he screams. "Can't hack it? 
Whar are you doing at the university 
level, you hack? Can you say lame?" 

Enter Thing Two, "Look, bud-to 
blow it in a class is one thing. To blow 
it and sit there and watch while it 
happens is another entirely. This is the 
founh week, The extent of the work 
you've done in the class involved going 
down to the Bookstore to price the 
books. You're dusr-face it. Face it now 
and get out. Or face it later and either 
fail or get the Big W on your 
transcripts." 

Retort time. "You ignorant slut! Yes 
you're behind, but you're willing to give 
up, just like that!? Oy vay! Besides, what 
are your parents going to think? They 
send you to school and you're willing to 
make them proud by dropping a class? 
That's pretty noble of you. Hey, wake 
up-they're going to kick your butt! And 
if you don't really care what they think, 

~ 

For most of you the decision is a 
tough one. Very tough. Some of you are 
taking only 24 or 26 units this quarter, 
yet in one of your two-unit labs there's a 
chance that you'D get a "B," so you're 
nying to decide whether you should 
plummer ro 22 units or hang on . 

~=~ __ ~~~ ________________ ~~~~~~~1 
You people should be shot. No 

offense, of course. 
On the opposite end of the spectrum 

are those of us with eight units-those 
of us who have reserved season tickets 
to UCSD through 1996. These people 
just aren't sure if comparative 
archaeology is the class for them, so 
maybe they should drop it JUSt to be 
sure. Surely there are more imponant 
things to do than study old ant hills . Or 
even new ones. 

because it's painful as hell. There's an 
little nuclear world war going on within 
your cerebrum, acted our by powers and 
characters beyond your control. Thing 
One is the little green man inside your 
head who wants you to drop the damn 
class, and Thing Two is the little yeDow 
man inside your head who insists you 
Stay in. Thing One stans the ball ·rolling 
by teDing you that you're a rotal blow-it 
for needing to drop a course in the first 
place, His argument is especiaDy 
effective if this is your first time out, 

think of what you'll think-you'll have 
to live with you, you know-you can't 
escape you, no matter what you do. And 
if you drop, what does that leave you 
with? Twelve units? Wow, busy 
schedule. Let's shoot for eight next 
quaner. Yeah, you're on a roll now." 

Hey, Thing Two, where are you? 
"Look, 12 units is not the end of the 
world . Lots of people go to school and 
don 't work or anything and are quite 
content to cruise with 12 units per 
quaner. One class is no big loss.

Monday, Jan. 28, 1985 11 , 

Certainly it's not going to throw you off 
that much-if you're that concerned, 
take a course over the summer. You'D be 
fine. But don't blow it here, Drop, guy, 
drop. Think how mce it will be to 
concentrate on just three classes and 
reaDy do well. Think how nice you and 
your GPA will feel. Think how happy 
you'll be not to have to get up for thar 
stupid 8 am class four times a week. 
Think, think, think. And drop." 

These twO battle it OUt for days, 
maybe weeks. And it all comes to a 
head JUSt before (or perhaps on) Friday ~ 
of the founh week, the final day to drop 
without the fact being recorded, If Thing 
Two's arguments didn't win the case just 
yet, he'll be back for an appeal during 
the ninth week (the last week to drop a 
class-with a "W '). 

The fact is, Thing Two usuaDy wins-
but Thing One doesn't lose graciously. 
He'll let you know about what a stupid 
flake you've been for the next several 
weeks, through finals and perhaps 
beyond, determined to make you feel so 
guiJry about this one innocent and 
relatively innocuous mistake that there's 
no way you would acrually repeat the 
atrocity next quaner. 

But what Thing One doesn't seem to 
realize is that his incessant nagging has 
a numbing effect, so that the first time 
you drop a class only serves to make the 
second time that much easier. Hell , 
you've already dropped once before, and 
it was probably a good decision-didn't 
fail the class, did you? You were a little 
embarrassed, your friends razzed you 
and your parents gave you a hard time 
for a while , but all in all, it was worth it, 
right? Right. 

And before you know it, it's that time 
of the quaner again. The founh week. 

It's third down and 37. The defense 
has seven defensive backs in the game. 
You can go for a long one and risk an 
interception, you can go for a screen 
pass that might postpone the inevitable, 
or you can punt now. You can punt on 
third down . 

That's the situation. It's a tough game, 
but someone's gOt to play it. 

When the going gets tough , the tou~ 
punt. ~

Baseball home opener Feb. 5 VS. Pt. Lorna 

Boys of summer, spring and fall 
By JOHN SCHACHT 

T HE PROBLEM WITH spring training at UCSD is that it begins in the fall. Unfonunately for the 
1985 UCSD Tritons, it doesn't count , 
either. It may not be in the record 
books, but for Coach Lyle Yates and his 
team, this year's fall-l mean spring-
training may be remembered as merely 
the intro to the team's most successful 
year ever. 

The boys of summer have been 
rehearsing for the opening of the '85 
season through the winter, actually 
beginning on October I . Winding down 
their most successful spring traming 
ever (15-8-1 as of jan. 24), Yates' 
Tritons enter the new season riding a 
crest of success unparalleled in Yates' 
preVIous three years as head coach. 

The Tritons are banking on the 
success of last year's playoff appearance 
as well. The staning cast will include 
from five to seven sophomores, who, as 
mere babes in the woods, formed the 
nucleus of last year's team. That team 
advanced further than any other UCSD 
team (of Yates') ever did, finally losing 
10 the final round to Azusa-PacIfic. Yates 
has re ruited pitching help where the 
staff needed it , and . coupled with the 
fact that 1985 offers the T rirons a 
revamped schedule, the ~ason beginS 
on a promising note . 

Perhaps Yates' greatest task in 1985 IS 
to channel the success of 1984 into a 
positive dlrectlon. If spnng training is 
any indication , the job is well on ItS 
way. "We had never advanced that far 
before in the playoffs ," Yates said. "I 
think the pressure definitely played a 
pan, especially with such a young team. 
But any championshIp team needs ro go 
through that playoff drive , ro know what 
the pressure involved is like. It's an 
excellent learning experience." 

Experience here is the key. Besides 
being able to keep a starting squad of 
young and improving players together 
over the year. Yates has 15 players out 
of 26 rerurning. 'These guys have had a 
year to play together, ro know one 
another better on the field . They learned 
a lot last year and , If we stay healthy, 
that will help us this year." 

Rather than sit back on the laurels of 
their post-season play, however, Yates 
went out and conti nued a recruitlng 
program that in three years has made a 
contender out of a pretender. -PItching 
has been the weak link In our program, 
and our recruiting this year really 
shored up some problem areas. It went 
very. very well . We went out the year 
before and recruited some excellent 
position ballplayers that formed the 
hean of our team last year. I think we've 
addressed our pitching problem this 
year," Yates deCIded . 

Like any winning franchise in any 
spon. a mixture of young talent is 
blCtllded with seasoned veterans, and 
the Tritons seem to possess thIS rare 
mix. The squad IS almost evenly diVIded 
between first and second year players, 
and juniors and seniors. A tribute to the 
recruiting program, the homegrown 
talent is matched by a handful of 
transfers who bring with them 
welcomed experience. Armed with no 
bundles of cash, slick automobiles or 
four-year scholarships, Yates has still 
managed to lure quality players to 
UCSD. 

"Our main attribut IS that we offer 

the players a growing baseball program 
and a better opponunity to play. [f they 
were to play Division [ or n, they might 
spend a lot more time on the bench 
behind the staners," the coach said . Of 
course UCSD has a 101 of other 
attributes, and coach Yates is no 
dummy. "Academically, UCSD already 
has a fine reputation and we emphasize 
that. Besides, you can't beat the 
location:' 

Another important prospect for the 
upc0ming year is a reSlructunng of the 
Triton's schedule. Dropping their dual 
membership in both the NAlA and the 
NCAA, UCSD is going to stick solely to 
the NCAA's Division Ill. "We went with 
the NAlA because it offered us a league 
structure, but we feel our pursposes will 
be served better as an independent in 
Division ll1," the coach said. The 
Triton's post-season play will now be 
determined on a selection process based 
on their play against other Division III 
schools, mstead of their league ranking 
in the AlA. According to Yates, "the 

AlA \vas baSically a Division n 
league-schools like Azusa Pacific and 
Westmont College-where the baseball 
programs can offer players athletic-
based financial aid . We don't do that, 
so [ fe lt better going against schools in 
our own calibre." 

This is nOt ro say that coach Yates 
has scheduled a series of games against 
qUiche-eating Tech or Scri pps 
Institution of Oceanography in order to 
run up an tmpresslve, but meaningless, 
record . The Tritons will sull be playing 
ten Division [ schools. including 

powerhouses SDSU and Irvine. 
Riverside-four times national champs 
in Division [[-arc one of the seven 
Division [[ teams on the UCSD 
schedule. And just for old times sake, 
the Tritons will be playing eighteen 
games against NAJA teams, the toughest 
competition expected to come from 
Westmon! and Southern California 
College. 

The big difference in this year's 
schedule is 20 games versus Division 1II 
schools-in the prevIOus three years the 
Tritons played a total of thiny. Recent 
regional Division UI champs La Verne , 
Cal State Stanislaus and Whittier College 
will oppose the Tritons. 

The coach explains the schedule shift 
in this way: "The Division 1 and [[ 
games we play this year will really help 
us in our division . We're not real 
worried about our overall record-we 're 
thinking Ohio." Ohio is the site of this 
}'ear's Oivision [[[ world series. Yates 
isn't making any predictions, but there's 
a look in his eye that tells you his 
expectations are as great as that wall in 
China he's visited once or twice. "[ 
expect: he said calmly, "to be very 
competitive within our division." 

Although his roster is set, Yates' 
staning lineup has yet to be determined 
but most of the positions have been 
filled; sort of. It's not a question of 
insufficient talent but, rather, an 
overabundance of it, if anything. 

CATCHING 
According to Yates, this is where it all 

begins. Witl10ut a good backstOp, you 

Mark Sloan. who has emerged as ace oj the pitching staff. Will share lhe rotation wilh 
Frank Califano. David Dt:Co,dova and Dan Healy. 

Coach Lyle Yales is looning at a group oj 
athletes who "believe tht) can win." 

might as well hang up your spikes and 
go home. And Yates has a big problem 
at this position. Actually, three big 
problems, to be exact. But these are the 
kind of problems a coach welcomes 
with open arms. Last year, Yates 
platooned Bob Natal (.329, 11 HR, 43 
RB[) and Derek Alkonis (.324, 5 HR, t3 
RBI) . Both made all league first team. 'To 
this dynamiC duo of sophmores, Yates 
adds a third-Dan DiMascio (.233, IHR, 
17 RBO. Because of an injury to Don 
Petersen, Natal and DiMascio will share 
most of the catching chores, with 
A1konis subbing at third . Between the 
three, Yates may have the ultimate 
catching machine. "All three are superb 
atheletes," Yates said, "and each one 
seems to do one thing better than the 
others-one calls a better game, one has 
a better arm, and one is better 
defenSively-it's a healthy problem to 
have." It certainly beats the heck out of 
the alternative. 

INFIELD 
There's good news and bad news 

here. The good news is on the right 
side of the diamond, wbere senior john 
Roseness (.292, 1 HR, 35 RBI) is likely 
to return at first and diminutive 
sophmore David Stanovic h (.309, 22 SB) 
will anchor second. Both are steady 
infielders. The bad news is on the left 
side of the diamond, where starting 
Third baseman Don Petersen (All League 
first team, .299, 2 HR, 32 RB[) is OUt for 
the season, having separated a shoulder 
playing football. Shortstop is up for 
grabs between Klaudio Biazevich (.357, 
2 HR, 26 RB[), sophmore Chris laRosa 
or possibly one of the new recruits. 
Yates remains undecided on the 
shortstop, defense being his primary 
concern. He feels Alkonis will have not 
trouble in the transition to third . 
OUTFIELD 

As I remember it , Abbott and 
Costello's famous skit waS about the 
infield. Then again, maybe they did a 
version for the triton outfield, too. 
Who's in left? [ don't know; Rosencss 
played out there at times last year, but 
his sub at first , Joe Wolf, has graduated. 
Who's in center? Possibly last year's 
ope ning-day starter Chris Stavros, or 
maybe one of the new recruits. Look for 
Natal to be in right when DiMascio is 
catching. Or maybe A1konis , with Natal 
at third. Outfielder Dennis COSta (.271 , 
2 HR, 21 RBI) will be missed 
(graduated), but look for Junior utility

No longer an intercollegiate team, ... 

Rugby clubs it 
By AlICIA AGOS, Sports Editor 

U PSET-MINDED would be a good way to describe the 1985 rugby team. Upset-minded, yes, but 
also determined-determined to 
continue as a rugby club spon despite 
getting axed last August from the 
intercollegiate program. 

Functioning as a club isn't as easy as 
it may sound. Functioning as a club 
spon on an intercollegiate level means 
you dish out money, lots of money. In 
1984. the rugby team received upwards 
of $6,000 in intercollegiate funds. In 
1985. the rugby club will get $500 from 
the school, in addition to the use of 
training and field facilities . Actually, 
things aren't looking so bad for the club. 
The players who compete are OUt there 
because they want to be, even though 
they know that by the end of the season 

-

each of them will be $300 and a few 
pints of blood poorer. 

Todd Clyde, who along with Mjlrk 
Rousseau is co-president of the club, 
remarked during Saturday'S round-robin 
play with the University of San Diego 
and San Diego State, "When we found 
out last summer that we were cut, we 
couldn't believe it. We tried to stay on 
as an intercollegiate team, but they 
wouldn't let us. The Intercollegiate 
Department drew up a bunch of 
violations on us . [f you get somewhere 
around five violations, they can cut you 
from the intercollegiate program. 1 think 
we had 20 violations. But some of them 
were like non-compatibility with high 
school programs, tOO many injuries, and 
not enough chance for female 
participation. Come on, how much

chancels there for female participation 
on the men's basketball team?" 

However, as Clyde and many others 
pointed out, "We weren't left stranded. 
13urel Dean from the Rec Department 
helps us a lot. She gives us advice on 
what to do for fundraiser5 and stuff like 
that." 

Fund ra isers and the success thereof 
are going to be crucial to a team which 
just recently pledged $1,000 to its 
coach, Tom Butler. A 20-year rugby 
veteran, Butler is , according to player 
Gary Schneir, coaching the team 
"because he wants to be out there. You 
could say he's upset that we got cut 
from the program. He's basically 
donating his time right now. We told 
him he'll eventually get money, but [ 
don't think he expects it." 

From its recent outing with USD and 
SDSU, the Triton team appears to be 
confident. easy-going, ready to play and 
ready to pany. Despite some 
inexperience, there is more team talent 
this year due in pan to the sheer 
numbers of people who have come out 
for the team. Steven Moore. himself a 
rerumee, said, "We do have more talent 
this year, but we also have a lot of 
people who haven't played rugby before. 
This year we have somewhere between 
35-40 players OUt regularly, compared to 

at: 

around 25 last year." 
The main forwards involved in a 

sport that has been described as 
"organized smear-the-queer" are Schneir, 
Jim Rego, Rod Murray, Alden Howe, 
Brad Shupe and Greg Baker, who, in an 
modesty, describes himself as "the best 
player on the team, no doubt about it." 

"The best drinker, maybe," said john 
Komar, who, along with Stu Matz, 
Rousseau and Clyde, are the backs to be 
watched this season. 

At the recent All-Cal Tournament held 
at UC Santa Barbara, UCSD went 1-2 
and, with some impressive play, beat 
Cal Berkeley's #2 team. Berkeley'S # 1 
squad is the top-ranked team in the 
nation, and the way the Tritons played 
built some confidence. Clyde feels that 
"if we play like we did against Berkeley, 
we'll be OK. This season we went 
scoreless against USD and San Diego

room in a massage parlor where they 
say they'll be able to cater to preferred 
clients. Kim realizes though that in 
order to afford the rental she has to 
build a chemele and she's only been In 
San Diego seveml months. They profi ted 
from the holiday season by organizing 
massage panies where guesrs could get a 
trial sample of massage. Kim also gives 
her phone number to a selected few 
regula rs who come for a massage and 
not an erotic experience. 

Without the guarantee of a license In 
her hand, Kim petS in her two-week 
notice. She can harldy tolerate Gibson 
and his operation, especiaUy when she 

gers assigned to do the nerve-
wracking outcalls. As she drives OUt to 
the clients house she asks herself many 
questions. Will the guy attack me? Is it a 
safe neighborhood? She says, "I don't 
want to ever do outcalls again. I was so 
scared the first time." Only one out of 
three outcaU clients asked for a sexual 
favor. She quickly left the premise 
WIthout a mishap. 

Money prepossesses Kim when she 
evaluates her position as a 23 year-old 
masseuse fres h from Pennsylvania. "I 
want to quit working for Gibson, but I 
need money. Sometimes it's tempting to 
take the money for the 'extras.' I think 
of aU the things I could buy with $100. I 
could live with it. 1 wouldn't be bothered 
too much. I've done some crazy things 
in my life."

capaC ity to go independent. Gibson 
provokes Kim's stubbomess and she's 
more determined than ever (0 stan her 
own business. She says she wanrs to go 
off on her own just to prove Gibson 
wrong when he says, · You don't know 
what you want out of the business." 

Ki m responds, "But 1 do know what I 
don't want." 

As she contemplates the risks of 
quilting a paying job in order to work 
independently, Kim has doubrs as much

quickly reassures her purpose and goal. 
She says, "I want to help people help

UCSD drops to CBC 
By MATI l.AIT 

LAST FRIDAY NIGHT the UCSD Tritons lost a close, 74-71 battle against the Cal Baptist Llncers. 
The Tritons showed remarkable intensity 
at the beginning of the game, but ~re 
unable to sustain that level of play. 

UCSD exploded to an 8~ lead. 
Brandon Nixon, who hit six of the 
Tritons' first eight poinrs (15 total for 
the night), helped spark the team to an 
early 14-point advantage with only eight 
minutes expired in the first half. Howe~r, 
from there on it was mostly downhil) . 

At the II -minute mark, UCSD's big 
man, Mike "Dabo" Dabasinskas, who is 
currently being scouted by the San 
Diego Chargers and the Seattle 
Seahawks for football , picked up his 
third personal foul , forcing coach Tom 
Marshall to sit him on the bench for the 
remainder of the half. Up until then, 
Dabasinskas had done a good job 
containing Llncers star Anthony Davis, 
but with Dabo on the bench, Cal Baptist 
was able to work the baU into Davis for 
key baskets and rebounds. 

The Llncers staned their comeback 
with the help of the Tritons' sloppy play 
and turnovers. In only four minutes Cal 
Baptist convened a 14-point deficit into 
a one-point lead, 26-25. For the test of 
the half the two teams exchanged 
baskets. UCSD was able to regain the 
lead at halft~, 38-37. 

In the second half the Tritons lacked 
the intensity and the aggressive play 
they had shown in the opening minutes 
of the game. Their defense was slow to 
react and their offense was getting only 
one shot off per posseSsion, with just 

five offensive rebounds for the game. 
Because of aggressive second-half play 
by forward BiU Reese , who led all 
scorers with 18 poinrs (16 in the 
second half), the Tritons were able to 
trade baskets with the Llncers. 

With e ight minutes left in the game 
and the score tied at 62, Dabasinskas 
was blamed for a questionable charging 
foul. He was upsct by the caU and had a 
few choice words with the referee, 
resulting in a technical foul. The 
charging call was one of several that 
hun the Tritons, although it was the 
calls the referees did not make that hun 
them more. 

Even with the Tritons' lackadaisical 
play, they stiD had an excellent chancr 
to win the game. With 5:34 left to play, 
UCSD led by five , 70-65. The lead soon 
slipped to one, and the club went to a 
slow-down offense. Triton guard Greg 
I<amansky then missed the front end of 
a one-and-one with 51 seconds to play, 
leaving the score at 71 -70 UCSD. The 
Lancers gained possession and were 
fouled with 19 seconds showing. Cal 
Baptist guard Craig Richards sank both 
of his free throws to gain his team the 
lead at 72-71. The Tritons took the ball 
downcoun and worked it around to 
Nixon, who missed a 15-foot jumpshot. 
Cal Baptist's Mike VanBerem s~ 
the rebound and was fouled with fIVe 
seconds left. He made both of the foul 
shors and iced a Lancer victory at 704-
71. 

When asked about his team's 
performance, coach Marshall said, "We 
played terrible. We ~re unable to keep

UCSD has a home game Tuesday 
night aginst Cal Lutheran. Despite the 
disappointing loss to Cal Baptist, the 
Tritons still have a good chance to make 
the playoffs. UCSD is an exciting team 
to wach, with remarkable ourside 
shooting strength in Brandon Nixon , 
Greg Kamansky and Bill Reese, and 
tOUlh inside players in Marie Barreca

STARTING PITCHING 

Gone are senior Eric Reynolds and 
sophmore Steve Saggiani. Mark Sloan 
(7W-6L, 5.00 ERA), who pitc hed big 
playoff games fo r Yates last year, has 
emerged as the ace of the staff. He is 
joined by se nior Frank·Califano (1-3, 
4.58), and newcomers David d e -
Cordova and Dan Healy, both of whom 
are southpaws. 
BULLPEN 

Yates feels that if this staff can remain 
healthy and eligible , it could be the 
strongest he's had . The bullpen has the 
same balance the staning staff does with 
three righthanders and th ree 
lefthanders. Senior Kevin lUingwonh (4-
0 , 4.30) is going to be Yates' stopper, 
especially based on his playoff 
perforrrrance last year. The middle and 
long re lievers are David Adomson (Fr.) , 
Oon Carruthu rs (Fr.) and Russ Strange 
(Jr.). Returning from last year are Rick 
Davis (Sr. 2-4,7.15) and Mike Petersen 
(Jr. 0-5, 7.L7). 
COACHING 

Yates and assistanrs Charlie Cox and 
Tom Can ier are a year older and, 
presumably, aJear wiser, too. This year 
they are joine by J im Toscano , whom 
Yates met on a baseball tour of the 
Orient this summer. From Colorado, 
Toscano will serve as infield coach and 
hining instructor. Although Yates prefers 
to credit his players with [he Triton's 
rise, it is the coaching staff who has 
helped shape this team. "They believe 
they can win," said Yates. ~
