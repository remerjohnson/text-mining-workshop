not keep non-students out. IDs were 
passed around." 

Dyer al 0 mentioned that there were 
everal instances of minors dri nki ng

He said the Price Center needs t be 

more ecure, though "a lot of attempts

II White Americans have 
created a mythology that 
overstates their importance 
By James Collier 
Semor Staff Wnler 

On my first day of 4th grade, m lassmates and 
r were given a :WO-page American hi tory book. 
Being black., and interested ill my 
past. I quickly looked up any 

in~ rmalton on ramou~ black 
Americans. 

Ali i could find IVa one 
paragraph 011 slavery. and one 
paragmph on the civil rights 
mo cmen\. Later that year. a ' our 
in ' tructor di used Ihe cau es of 
the Civil War, ~he spoke n the 
treatment of ~Iave,. 

"Owners Irealcd Iheir lavc~ a 
if they were their own children," 
my teOlcher remarked. "The slave ' 
were rclatively happy ." 

"Gee."] thoughl, '" gues, 
being a slave W~Il't that bad .... .. 

1 rt!mclI1iJer tJ..>illg teased by the 
other children about the fa~1 thai 
m anee,1 r~ I ere sla ve~, and that 
"they didn't do much for America."

My fir,t year in c liege I took an Afri an-
merican history c!a,s, and I listened 10 my 

mstructor give infom1ation Ihatlnever had acces' 
to before. To ay Ihe lea t. I was angry . 

And I wa~n'l alone. 
There was a time when it was a ommon bel it I 

that whites were the supreme beings on the plane . 
And they created a mYlhology to gowilh this beltcf

tol)' through a political lens, and 
because they approach Ihelr revi-
sion with a polillcal agenda- wilh 
omelhing to prove - Ihey suffer 

the ~ame sins as th tradilionaJi ts: 
revisioniSI hl ~tory i often Ii lied with 
asmuch mylhand melodrama, wilh 
as much fabrication. as tradilional 
hi (01) . [(' ju!>t tilted loward the 
opposite end of the ::ope trum_ 

Accordingtothe revisionists, for 
in!>IOlnce, Ihe fact thut Jeffer on 
owned "lave casts everedoublson 
what he wrote in Ih Declaration of 
Independence. 

Becau!>e hl:did not live inaccor-
danee wim it, hi philosophy is s us-
pect and hi sincerity is questioned. 
Jefferson is nOI een by revisionists 
as a hero of the American Revolu-
lion, but as an oppre:, 'or - he was 
not the author of the Declaration, 
bUI only the masler of laves. 

But this is illy . Revisionists of-
tcn claim to be telling Ihe "real" 
hi tory of the country when they 
spin these tales, but their version of 
the past is easily as skewed as that 
which they eek to oppo c. 

Ju tasthe"deadwhitemale "in 
American hislory were not saints, 
neither were Ihey demons: Jefferson 
was both the aUlhor of the Declara-
tion of Independence and a man 
who owned slaves. If only one of 
these facts i pre ented , it only tells 
half the tory. 

Last year, 1 took a Chicano his-
tol)' cIa s as part of the general 
education requirement for Third 
College. Tile profe~ or, Ramon 
Gutierrez, let his political opinions 
badly tarnish hi hi toricaJ teach-
ings. 

Throughout the quaner, I was 
exposed to a politically correct ver-
sion of his tol)'- one largely differ-

ent from th..: ne 1 gr~11 up with,and 
one thai is equully biused. 

Instead of a hbtory tilled With 
cOI\boys waging righteou,> viclory 
over the avage rcd ,kins, , wa!> 
pre ented lVilh greed-dri en Euro-
peans laughtering inn ent mive 
Americans. 

ccording to GUlierrez, the his-
tory of the American !>outhwesl is 
simply one long 5t I)'ofwhite blood-
lust, male domination, and Chris-
tian oppre' sion - a white, male 
con ' piracy de igned 10 ~ubjugate 
women and minorities, 

Becau e of his polilical agenda, 
Guiteniez"revi~ed"hislory to some-
thing more to his liking. But his 
vcr ion contains as lill ie objective 
Iruth as "The Ballad of Davey 
Crackett." 

Admilledly, as long as people, 
the ubjecti ve animals Ihal they ar.:, 
are involved in recording and int~r­
preting hislorical f aCIS, bias is inevi-
table. 

However,politically olTe tbias 
- where white male are viewed as 
Ihe major propagators of e il - is 
a intelieclllally bankrupi as politi-
cally incorrect bias. 

[n a colorful turn of phra~e, 
Gutierrez described the ludents in 
his class as tree:, that have been 
pulled to one side alilheir live . lie 
aid that his job - as a leacher - i~ 

to pull them just a far 10 the oppo-
sile side. so thut they can s tand up 
slraight when released. 

But lhal 'S ridiculou . One doe~ 
not counterpropaganda wilh propa-
ganda, lie with lie, exaggeration wilh 
exaggenltion. 

A teacher's job is to teach lhe 
lruth, or as clo e to il as he can 
reali. ticallycome, Thatinvolvesthe 
good and the bad, ofbolh the "dead 
while males" and everybody else. 
Thomas Jefrer on wasn't perfecl, 
but he certainly wasn'l scum.

Continued from page Hl 

Tom Stoppard uses a simple but very lelling 
a umplion: namely that to Hamlet and the audiance 
of Shakesphere's play, Hamlet ' 'friend' are lillie 
bUI functionarie . 

By ombining 250 lines of the hakespeare tex t 
\ ith hi, own \ ork .. Sloppard ha blown up a ingle 
detail and wrenched enough material to create a 
drama. It would be comparable to refilmi ng "Dances

by other film adaplation of play - Ihe abililY to treat

debt to Samuel Be kell and " \ aiting for Godot" is 
enormous. Fortunately, IOppa rd make~ his endings 
lightly les ambiguou . 

For the cinema, even the focus of the whole piece 
has been al tered. On tage , " Rosencrantz and

bouts of verbal games while hake pearc's " ll amlet"

Theduo in the tilm are played 
to rare perfecti on by Oldman 
and Roth . Oldman's perfor-
mance IS a panicular revelation 
even in light of the impre sive 
s reen c redits he has racked up, 
in luding "Sid and ancy" and 
"Prick Up Your Ears." He dem-
onstrates a superb comedic tal -

speare's "Hamlet" goes by

speeche ' he wrote in 1966 that 
interrupted the cine matic flow. 
Also. new scenes have been

lions heighlen the piece' com-
edy. Ro encrantz, for example, 
continuall y makes 'cientificdis-

the distance between the audi-
ence and actors prevent such

formance is perfect ly complimented by a wonder-
fully dour Tim Roth. Together Ihey become a medi -
eval equivalent of "Bill and Ted," only their "Ad-
ventu re" end with their deaths . 

Richa rd Dreyfu i obviously intended to be the 
commercial draw of the film. A late replacement for 
an aili ng ean Connery, Dreyfu ' give an admi -
rable performance that is probably more primal than 
the 'Sean-as-Sean' perfomlace Connery normally 
offers. He de, however. lack the menace Ihe role 
really demand . As the hief Player, the leader of 
the travelling a tor that come to Elsinore, Dreyfus 
is the third center of attention. Unfortunately, he 
remains only lightly more interesting that the lack-
luster performance from the film's Hamlet, 
Claudiu ,and Gertrude. The role are reversed here. 
In the theaterall you wish for i that R. and G. would 
exit as oon a~ possible. In the ci nema, all you want 
is for Oldman and Roth to come back ' into shot." 

The performam' ;:!. extracted in the movie are all 
the more of a revelation considering "Rosencrantz 
and Guilden tern" marks Tom Stoppard 's directo-
rial debut. Hi only dalliance with cinema up to thi 
point ha been as the author of the creenplays for 
''The Ru s ia House:' "Brazi l," and "Empire of the 
Sun." 

fully well in the movie theater. 
Admittedly, the movieocca-

ionall y drags a the audience 
becomes confused or Stoppard exhausts a Iheme he 
has developed. Such in tances occur infrequently, 
however, and it actually makes the accelaration of 
dialogue all the more thrilling . 

The commercia l hope for this masterly film are not 
great. Mel Gibson and Glenn Close failed to make 
Zeffere li's umptuou " Hamlet" anything approach-
ing a commercial hit. Consequently. what hope does a 
film wi th a ge nera lly little-known cast, a fir t-time 
direclor and a title nOI ea ' ily fitted onto a cinema 
billboard stand? 

On the week of " Rosencrantz and Guildenstem's 
release. American audiences are flocking to ee Steven 
Seagal and the all-conquering turtle in anything but 
in tellectual entertainment. 

Tom Stoppard's film encourages the audience to 
tandout ide the action and let suspicions, revel ation, 

and in ights engage the imagination for some wel-
come cerebral acrobatics. At first, a reaction to the film 
is hard tQ express. bUI admiralion and apprecia tion for 
the work replaces any initial confusion.

Fighting Tradition 
• "Ju Oou" a tale of lust and murder in rural China 

By Leng Loh 
Semor Staff Wrtter 

Power Icuggle ? ew idea ' v . 
Iradition? Censorship? They' re not 
purely American phenomena. 

Shonly before Chine e director 
Zhang Yimou 's film" Ju Dou"was 
nominated for the 1991 Be t For-
eign Language Film Academy 

ward, the government of the 
People' Republic requested that 
the film be withdrawn from con-
·ideration. 

Officials claimed that the rea-
ons fort he request were relaled to 

the film's "immoral" exual con-
tent, but some muse that image-
consc ious politicians did not like 
its bleak depiction of rural Chine e 
life -or, worse yet, that they saw 
Ihe film as an allegorical cri ticism 
of the lifling tradilional power 
structures in China. 

And. like most call s forcen or-
ship. the request has fueled the 
publicity fire for the pa ionate 
"Ju Dou." Not that that is bad. Far 
from it. "Ju Do u" deserve ' atten-
tion . 

But hopefully the political con-
troversy won't overwhelm the vi-
sion of this beautifully -filmed 
story. 

" Ju Dou" is a foreign film that 
doesn 'trcquire reading every single 
subtitle-a definite bonus if you're 
new to foreign language films.h's 
not an obscure imelleclUal art film 

u 

that require, deep thought 10 un-
derstand. 

The imple dialogue merel y 
helps to pad out the intense emo-
tions expre ;,ed in the characters' 
faces. The story is one of intent 
and a tion, not idle meditation. 

Set in rural prewar hina. the 
film is the stor) of Ju Dou (played 
by Gong Li). th e young bride 
bought by the adisticYangJin han 
(played b Li Wei) . 

The old man owns a dye fa tory 
\ hich he runs with his adopted 
nephew Tianqing (played by Li 
Baotian. who was also featured in 
" Woman , Demon, Human" which 
was a film that played on campus 
in the International Style film fe~­
tival). 

Jin han . who had tortured his 
previous two wives to death for 
failing 10 bear him an heir, contin-
ue his pattern of violence with Ju 
Dou - but doesn't count on hi s 
nephew falling in love with hi s 
viclim. 

Even though he ' s 40 year old, 
Tianquing peeps through a knot-
hole like a teenager at the beautiful 
Ju Dou as she bathes. 

Both a helpl ess, de perate, gi rl 
and a mercilessly vengeful bitch, 
Ju Dou is the picture of the bat-
lered wife who fights back.

It· s somewhat moralistic in a

it is handled wi th a ensitive touch
