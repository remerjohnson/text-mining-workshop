Medical Waste Continues to Appear 
On Beaches; Naval Link Denied 
By MARY BETTY HEARD 
Staff Writer 

Despite the U.S. Navy's pas-
sage of more stringent regulations 
forthedumpingofmedical mater-
ials on Oct. 31, medical waste 
continues to find its way to San 
Diego shores. 

The last discovery of beached 
waste, according to the Los An-
geles Times, occurred on Nov. 19 
and included such items as a pres-
cription bottle, a bottle of oxalic 
acid, an<~ bandages. 

Although recent allegations 
have placed blame for medical 
wa te wash-ups on the Defense 
Department, the Navy denies 
responsibility. 

"None of the medical waste has 
been linked to the United States 
Navy," said Navy Chief Journal-
ist Craig Huebler. 

One item that some believe 
washed ashore after Navy dump-
ing is a bottle of oxalic acid , often 
used to clean brass and teak wood. 

Huebler, however, believes the 
bottle came from another source 
since the sh'ip allegedly carrying 
the acid, he said, can account for 
every bottle used in the last three 
months. 

After a local pilot reported see-
ing "a gray ship" dumping bags 
into the ocean several weeks ago, 
the Navy requested information 
from all commands regarding 
Naval dumpings at sea. 

The Navy has also begun inves-

changes made by the 1986 Tax 
Reform Act that requires em-
ployees who work over 17.5 
hours per week (averaged over 
a six-month period) to receive 
health insurance. 

According to an October 
tatement by A.S. Vice-

President Mordecai Potash, 
the University may find it eco-
nomically ad vantageous to 
reduce student work hours 
below the 17.5 hour mark. 

UC Undergrad Education 
T~ Be Subject of Meetings 

According to Phyllis Walker, 
associate director for part-time 
employment at the Career 
Services Center, tudent 
employees will be excluded from 
the University's employee bene-
fit program, CORE, because 
they receive better benefits as 
students. 

Students who are currently 
covered by CORE will be 
dropped and will have the 
option of signing up for the 
Con olidated Omnibus Bene-
fits Reconciliation Act 
(COBRA) program.

istrators from all University of 
California campuses meet three 
time within the next ix months. 

Joseph Watson, UCSD Vice 
Chancellor and chairper on of

PA UE, an outgrowth of UC' 
Task Force on Lower-Division 
Education , will concentrate on 
the tructure, balan e, and diver-

UCSD Development Plan Approved 
By JILL COLLEY

The Academic Senate unanimou Iy approved a 
"Master Plan" calling for the development of over 
five million square feet of the UCSD campus. 

According to Frieder eible, chairper on of the 
ommittee on ampu and Community En i-

22 by the plannmg con ultant of kidmore. OWing,

Currently, U D has an enrollment of 14,600. 
However, according to the consultant, the enroll-

Additionally, there are now 6,000 on-campus

"There i probably no more enormou problem

Pre entty, there are approximately 11,000 cars on 
campus daily, but the Master Plan assume that 
within II year there will be 26,000 car here 
everyday. 

To deal with this problem, parking tructures 
were included in the plan which. according to the

tigating which ships were in the 
area at the time of the sighting. 

The exact ship, Huebler aid , 
may be difficult to find since there 
are often 20-30 Naval ships out of 
port at a time. 

According to public health 
expert, the ambiguities ur-
rounding the medical waste prob-
lem make it difficult to identify 
the origins of the waste. 

According to Charles Pryatel, 
the program coordinator for the 
Hazardous Materials Division of 
the San Diego County Health 
Department, suppJie sold to the 
Navy by the Defense Department 
could be resold . Huebler con-
firmed this possibility. 

The Navy's theory is that most , 
if not all, of the beached waste 
found on San Diego and Orange 
County shores in recent weeks 
came from one ship which 
dumped materials in a single large 
quantity. 

While Pryatel declined to spec-
ulate on the Navy's theory, he did 
suggest an alternative scenario to 
Naval dumping. 

Conjecturing on the presence 
of hypodermic needles found on 
beaches, Pryatel said that needle 
have been found many time on 
beaches in areas where drug abuse 
is common. The needles, he said , 
could have been left near the 
water after drug partie .

UCSB Grad Student Accused 
of Stealing Research Cocaine 

SA TA BARBARA - A UCSB employee 
accused of stealing nine grams of pharmaceutical 
research cocaine and falsifying an official Drug 
Enforcement Agency report pled not guilty to the 
charges Monday during a municipal court arraign-
ment in Santa Barbara. 

Michael Dickman, a 29-year-old graduate student 
employed by the psychology department's ani~al 
research facilities, was arrested Oct. 26 followmg a 
two-week criminal investigation which revealed the 
cocaine was tolen from a secured storage safe and 
replaced with a mixture of amphetamines and 
procaine. 

Investigator narrowed their search to Dickman 
because he was one of four people with legal access to 
the drug safe and he has a past criminal history which 
includes several misdemeanor narcotic offenses. As a 
histimologist , or tissue specialist , in the lab, Dickman 
was responsible fo r maintaining and dispersing drugs 
to researchers and students. 

Embossing Device Stolen from 
UCLA Registrar's Office 

LOS A ' GELES - A device used to authenticate 
university documents was tolen from the UCLA 
Registrar's office during working hours Nov. 2. 

A suspect - possibly a student - was the last 
perso n seen near the office in Murphy Hall shortly 
after an employee discovered the device missing 
from an unattended ervice counter. 

The device is a heavy handstamp used to 
emboss documents such as diplomas and loan 
verifications with the official university seal. 

Many documents bearing the seal require a 
seconci stamp with an official's signature, Accord-
ing to police, no other stamps were missing. 

When property is stolen from UCLA, officials often 
agree to take it back with no questions asked . 

ot this time, 
The problem, said William Locklear, director of 

the Registrar's office, is not that the device was 
stolen, but that it was stolen apparently for per-
sonal gain. 

First Woman to Head UC Hospital 
Mary Piccione, special assistant to the chancellor of 

the State University of ew York, has been named to 
direct the UC Irvine Medical Center. She is the fir t 
woman to hold the top administrative position at a 
University of California teaching hospital. She also is 
the highest paid woman administrator in the UC 
system, 

"We're delighted that Ms. Piccione is joining us , 
Her record demonstrates that she can make difficult 
decisions that work," said Edward Quilligan, vice 
chancellor of health sciences and dean of the the UCI 
College of Medicine, 

Piccione has spent more than 20 years in the health 
care indu try, including 10 year with University Hos-
pital at SU ' Y Health Science Center in Brooklyn. 
During her six years as executive director for the hos-
pital , she was responsible for development of its $95 
million budget, day-to-day operations. finances, pro-
gram development and planning. 

She reorganized the finances and operations of the 
medical center resulting in a major revenue increase,_ 
co-chaired the Health Systems Agency Perinatal Task 
Force, reorganized ambulatory care and developed 
and implemented the University Hospital Regional 
Cardiac Surgical program with affiliated hospitals. 

UC's May Increase Requirements 
for Entrance to Solve Overcrowding 
An annual report published by the Board of Admis-
sions and Relations with chool Boards has revealed 
some major issues facing the UC system in the next 
few years. 

First, the size of the "eligible pool" (the proportion 
of the high school graduating class eligible for admi -
sion to UC) increased . Recent studie show that 
14 percent of all high chool seniors are eligible for 
the UCs, while the system only allows for the top 
one-eighth of the graduates. 

Secondly, the courses required for entrance (the -a-
f" requirements) may not be as broad as needed to 
prepare high school seniors for college. Since the 
basic "a-P' subjects were instituted more than 50 
years ago, some changes have been proposed. 
Examples of these are a fourth year of mathematics, 
a second year of laboratory science, and new 
requirements in world history, fine and performing 
arts as well as geography. 

Redefining the "a-P' scale may hay.: a limiting fac-
tor on the number of high school seniors eligible. In 
effect this could solve the predicted overcrowding 
problem the UC Regents foresee . 

I UCSDINFO 
UCSD Adds Russian Literature Major 
and Japanese Studies Minor 

UCSD has added two new areas of study this year. 
The new Rus ian Literature major has a dual pur-

pose - to make students proficient in reading, writ-
ing, and speaking Russian language, and to teach 
them about Russian and Soviet literature. The B.A. 
program requires thorough preparation in Russian 
language, extensive study of Russian literature in the 
original language, and a year-long survey course on 
Russia n literature (in translation). The new major fea-
tures a specialist in the teaching of Russian, native 
speakers to assist in language courses, and two profes-
sors of Russian literature. 

Also added to UCSO's curriculum is a minor that 
studies the history, culture, society and language of 
Japan. The Japanese Studies minor is an interdisci-
plinary program which uses the resources of humani-
ties and social sciences departments and the Graduate 
Schools of International Relations and Pacific Rim 
Studies. Study of the Japanese language is strongly 
encouraged, but not required.

The Master Plan calls for a 
system linking together the separ-
ate neighborhoods as well as a 
link connecting the neighbor-
hoods with the central administra-
tive area. 

It also includes the development 
of "academic corridors, "buildings

pus, consisting of canyons and 
chapparel, will be preserved as a

Alteration of the current road-
way sytem is also called for by the 
plan under which Gilman Drive 
and Villa La Jolla Drive will be 
combined to form a single loop. 
Campus Point Drive and Eastgate 
Mall would also be combined, 
forming a loop road at the east 
end of campus. 

The plan also proposes a new 
entrance at the southeast corner 
of the campus which would con-
tinue through the campus and 
function as a public roadway to 
Scripps aquarium. 

Many of those who attended 
the presentation expressed con-
cern over various aspects of the 
proposed plan. 

Concern over the "architectural 
statement" of the plan was voiced 
at the meeting and the opinion 
that "too much concrete" already 
exists on campus was expressed. 

The planning consultants, how-
ever, said that the Master Plan 

. includes ways of "softening" pre-
existing concrete buildings by 
incorporating them with other 
types of buildings and landscapes: 

Preservation of open space was 
also di cussed. The planning con-

sultants suggested that, as develop-
ment continues, a committee 
should be formed to lobby against 
attempts to invade the proposed 
park space of the Master Plan. 

The now approved Master Plan 
will undergo one more period of 
revision before a final document, 
expected at the beginning of next 
year, is produced . 

"Our next layer of planning 
should be cautious, lucid and 
carefully chosen," said Newton 
Harrison, a UCSD professor of 
art and member of the Committee 
on Campus and Community 
Environment. 

" In some ways the plan is in 
operation already," commented 
one planning consultant. "We 
came [to UCSD] in the midst of 
what seemed like a building boom 
.. . It seems like every project we 
talked about was on the front 
burner ... This campus seemed to 
be an oven without any back 
burners." 

Director of Campus Planning, 
Jeff Steindorf, stated that the last 
complete plan for the physical 
development of the UCSD cam-

pus was compiled in 1980. 
He explained that in 1980, the 

prevailing demographic and eco-
nomic trends were indicating that 
enrollment and state funding levels 
were likely to hold at steady levels 
or, perhaps, even decline. 

"Such conservative and some-
times dire forecasts," Steindorf 
said, subsequently led not only to 
expectations of slow growth, but 
also to the preparation of con-
tingency plans. 

"Contrary to those predictions, 

Monday, November 28, J988 3 

in the 1980s the matriculation 
rate of eligible UC students 
unexpectedly increased by 50 
percent and enrollment swelled," 
Steindorf said . 

Consequently, UCSD's build-
ing program accelerated and, by 
January 1987, when the Master 
Plan was first discussed by the 
Academic Senate, new enrollment 
projections were adopted. There 
was strong support for the idea of 
such an expansion plan at thaI 
time.

T-Reg Problems 
Now that most everyone has had the opportunity 

to use T-Reg, an evaluation of the system seems in 
order. As is to be expected with any new system, 
T-Reg alleviated some old problems, and it created 
some new ones. 

It used to be that students had to make the trek 
down to the Registrar in order to get classes. If you 
were off campus or out of town, you were pretty 
much out of luck. And when you finally did get to 
campu and turned in your course request card, you 
had to wait weeks to find out what classes you 
actually received . These inconviences have been 
eliminated , but some new ones have taken their place. 

The biggest complaint students seem to have with 
T-Reg is that they can't get through. The line are 
always busy. Assistant Regi trar Bill Brown says that 
this is due to the physical limitations of the system. 
Currently, T-Reg has only 16 telephone lines available. 
UCLA, the only other UC campus that uses a 
telephone registration system, has 40 lines available. 

(UCLA's system differs from UCSD's in another 
respect : The enrollment process is divided into two 
stages. In the first stage students are allowed to 
register for 10 units. Once everyone has done this , 
students call back and register for the rest of their 
units. Although this system seems more fair, it al 0 
eems more inconvenient). 

Brown said that UCSD plans to install 16 additional 
lines some time next year. This will coincide with the 
implementation of a more sophisticated telephone 
enrollment computer program called the Integrated 
Student Information System (IS IS). UCS D and four 
other colleges have worked for three or four years on 
its design, Brown said. UCSD will be the first college 
to implement the program. 

Some students report that the recorded computer 
prompts are garbled or inaudible. In addition, some 
double-majors have difficulty enrolling in restricted 
courses. Brown said that both problems are being 
corrected. 

Given that the system received roughly 33,000 calls 
this quarter, it's surprising that things went as well as 
they did. According to Brown, the system received 
only 10,000 calls last spring, yet more students 
reported problems during that enrollment period. 

We applaud the Regist rar's office on its attempt to 
m,,:':e enrollment more convenient for students and 
we urge them to rectify the system's current short-
comings as soon as possible. 

The Grateful Dead 
Do you remember the second presidential debate, 

when Michael Dukakis and George Bush were 
a sked about their modern-day heroes? Bush bla-
thered some pseudo-patriotic garbage about astro-
nauts, and Dukakis stumbled through a non-answer. 

We were thinking about that thl: other day when 
we read about efforts by the Grateful Dead to organ-
ize and coordinate world-wide opposition to defor-
estation of the Amazon rain forest basin , the 
world's "lungs." 

Besides being unique and interesting musicians 
who have made a living playing what they want and 
not pandering to the music business, the Dead have 
rarely lost sight of their primary goal : education 
and good times for themselves and their friends. In 
this case, they're defining their friends as all of u 
who have to breathe. 

Friend and promoter Bill Graham like to say 
that it's great that people like U2 and Bruce S pring-
steen do benefits, but notes that the Dead are special 
partly because they did gigs for others when they 
didn 't have rent for themselves. 

Sad to say, people who have heroes like the Grate-
ful Dead (warts and all) can't get elected president.

'The University of California Pres-
ident's Office published an employ-
ment analysis of University personnel 
this year. I have examined these data 
and made ome quick calculations; 
the results are suggestive, especially 
in light of the continuing budget 
crunch. 

UC employs 113,227 people of 
whom 36,233 are students. Thus, the 
number of non-student employees is 
76,994. 

Eliminat ing Researchers, Librari-
ans and Cooperative Extension Per-
sonnel left me with three categories: 
Administrative, Staff and Teaching. 
The total personnel in these three 
categories is 70,420. 

Staff account for 62 percent of all 
these people. 

There are 15,436 administrators, 
or 22 percent of the 70,240 total non-
student personnel. 

Combming the staff and adminis-
trative categories, nearly 85 percerit 
of all University employees have jobs 
in which they do not teach. 

Thus, teachers comprise only 15 
percent of total University employees.

At the Polls 
Editor: 

The Registrar of Voters infringed 
upon hundreds of people's voting 
rights at UCSD on election day. They 
prohibited people from voting 
through the use of time. 

Many of us are saying that if you 
do not have a few minutes to spare for 
your country, it is your fault if you do 
not vote. I agree. However, what if it 
took an hour-and-a-half to vote? 

An hour-and-a-half is a long time. 
Why did it take so long? Could it be 
that there was only one place to vote 
on campus at UCSD? Could it be 
that there were not enough workers 
to move people through the confirma-
tion to vote process? Or, could it be 
that the college students of UCSD 
were unprepared to vote and did not 
bring their sample ballots? 

First, I will comment on the last 
question. Most of the students and I, 
myself, prepared and tudied the 
issues, candidates, and propositions. 
We were ready to vote. All of us had 
our sample ballots filled out and with 
us. Logically, it only took each student 
about a minute to vote once he/ she 
had the opportunity. In other words, 
the voters were not at fault . 

The problem, as I saw it, was that 
everybody on campus was assigned 
to one place to vote, the Revelle 
Formal Lounge. I arrived there about 
3 p.m. The line looked like it con-
tained no more than fifty people. 
Finally, after standing an hour-and-
a-half in line, I made it near the 
voting area. 

I saw the next major problem 
causing this long delay. There were 
only three people working at the 
voting booths, one checking off 
names, the other signing people in 
and a third preparing bllllots for the 
punch. Not enough people were 
staffed to meet the flow of voters. 
Also, the people confirming the eligi-
bility of voters were extremely slow. 

Upon leaving after voting, I was 
startled by the length of the line. It 
was twice as long as when I waited . I 
easily realized it could take a person 
close to three hours to vote. I talked 
with many people after the election 
and they said they did not have time 
to vote on campus. An hour of their

Comm Profs, Students Isolated from Reality 
By JOHN SHAW 
EdilOr in Chief 

"The press are biased. The Union is too conservative 
and its articles are poorly written. The LA 7imes'San 
Diego coverage is more of an afterthought than any-
thing else. San Diego Magazine caters to the rich. The 
Reader is obscure and pretentious." 

Is the University more concerned with 
mental masturbation than with affect-
ing change in a less-than-perfect world? 

All these are common criticisms of San Diego print 
journalism. 

A week-and-a-half ago students, faculty, and staff 
had an opportunity to put their money where their 
mouths were. They didn't. 

The Guardian organized a forum on the naive 
assumption that people gave a damn about improving 
San Diego journalism. We were wrong. 

We thought if we got a group of respected and 
influential writers and editors together to take ques-
tions from the general public, we might bridge the gap 
between media producers and media consumers. The 
bridge didn't get built and the gap widened some more. 

In the process of organizing the event, I spoke to 
quite a few people. Everyone said it was a great idea -
what potential - they wouldn't miss it for the world. 
They did. 

I understand that people get busy this time of the 
quarter. I understand that its easier to stay in than to 
go out. I also understand that talk is no longer cheap 
- they're Jiving it away. 

I am disappointed with the average person who 
knew about the forum and didn't show. I'm disap-
pointed, but I can live with it. I find it more difficult, 
however, to dismiss the absence of two groups of 
people who really .hould have been there - commun-
ication professor. and communication students (of 
which I am one). 

I specifically made a point of puttina a flyer advertis-
ing the event in every communication professor's and 
graduate student's on-campus mailbox. For good 
measure I did tbe same at the political science depart-
ment.I, and several otherediton, handed out flyers at 
our communication, political science, and other classes. 

How many people showed up? Certainly less than 
20. How many communication students? Maybe one 
or two outside of the Guardian editors. How many 
communication professors? None. 

I find this disturbing. Not because the small attend-
ance made me feel embarrassed for myself and for my 
school. And not because I had hoped for a more lively

Q and A: Do you think that using paper cups instead of styrofoam (to preserve the 
environment) is worth the inconvenience? 

J don '[ see any inconvenience 
by using paper cups. J would 
rather have styrofoam, but to 
save the environment, it's 
worth the sacrifice.

time was too valuable to be spent 
dawdling in a line. Most of them 
had to go to work, class or be 
somewhere. 

I propose that the Registrar of 
Voters provide more places to 
vote on campus. They could have 
one at each of the colleges. Also, 
they should have more staff to 
meet the supply of voters. What 
would have happened if more 
people had planned to vote? It 
could ha,ve taken very determined 
voters an extremely long time to 
vote, and the less determined 
voters would not have voted 
because of the time commitment. 

Steve Schwartz 

(Editor's note: There were 
actually two voting places on 
campus. Of course, students could 
only VOle al their precinct, and 
lhat didn't make the lines any 
shorter at Schwartz's precinct.)

J definitely think that it is 
worth whatever inconvenience 
it may cause, because if we 
continue to ignore the damage 
we are doing to our environ-
ment it may become too late 
for us to reverse that damage 
and our planet may simply get 
rid of us if we don 't start to 
clean it up!

Los Alamos Lab Project To Allow 
Supercomputer Communication 
By LOREN CHEN 
Cunlributing Writer 

The planned development of a 
supercomputer switch was an-
nounced ov. 15 by the Univer-
sity of California's Los Alamos 
laboratories. The switch will allow 
computers to "talk" to each other 
at a speed 20 times that which is 
presently possible. 

The proposed crossbar switch, 
to be built in conjunction with 
Digital Equipment Corporation 

ing Group at Los Alamos, com-
mented on the joint project at the 
Supercomputing '88 Conference 
in Orlando, Florida. 

Morrison said that "the switch 
will mean an enormous increase 
in performance for users of su-
percomputers. We'll be doing 
things we couldn't do before ." 

The project , Morrison said , is 
"a matter of combining various 
technologies that have never been 
combined before. We're eager to 
get started on testing this hard-
ware and [are] confident of suc-
ceeding." 

The crossbar switch will be a 
composite of two main compo-
nents . ~os . Alamos is to develop 
the sWllchmg core, while DEC 
designs the crossbar interface 
which will communicate with 
computers using a high-speed 
channel. 

UCSD Supercomputer's Man-
a.ger of Engineering and Opera-
tions, Dan Drobnis views the 
project as a learning ~xperience . 

"What [the project's re-
~archersJ learn will have implica-

tions III the future of the field" 
Drobis said . '

"The switch will mean 
an enormous increase 
in performance for 
users of supercom-
puters." 

- John Morrison 

(DEC), will allow up to 32 super-
computers to communicate 800 
million bits of electronic informa-
tion per second ·simultaneously. 

Don Tolmie, who works with 
the Los Alamos team, likened the 
present single-path computer 
communications system to a tele-
phone party line. Such a system 
allows only one line of communi-
cation which all computer users 
access . 

The new multi-path network, 
Tolmie explained , will be like a 
regular telephone system in which 
users can speak to each other 
independently and simultane-
ously.

Forum 
Continued from page 4 
di cussion. I find it disturbing 
because the arne individuals that 
have stood before me and critic-
ized the media in the classroom 
didn't find the time to actually 
attempt to improve the institu-
tions they so often find fault with. 

Maribeth Mellin , an editor at 
San Diego Magazine, rai ed an 
interesting point during the forum. 
She said that one of her intern , a 
UCSD student, said she had ana-
lyzed in cla one of Mellin's 
award-winning articles on the 
Sagon Penn trial. The course 
examined how various publica-
tions treated certain topics. 

Mellin was dumbfounded to 
learn that (I) students were actu-
ally analyzing her work in class 
and (2) that no one bothered to 
ask her, or any other journalist, to 
come to class to explain why she 

wrote her article the way she did . 
In my own classes, I have been 

asked to analyze quite a number 
of media products. ever once 
did it occur to me, or was I 
encouraged , to try to talk to the 
producer of the article or televi-
sio n program in que tion. It ' an 
obviou thing to do isn't it? 

o why didn't it occur to me? 
Because I , probably like m o:;t 
other students, allowed myself to 
focus so much on theory that I 
forgot about reality. I have to a k 
myself what I have been doing 
here for the past four years. 

Is the University more con-
cerned with mental masturbation 
than with affecting change in a 
less-than-perfect-world? Does 
anyone really care? It's hard to 
tell . 

I'd organize a forum 10 discuss 
it, but I don't think anyone would 
come.

lead that had been brought to my 
attention bya friend . But the need 
for that call vani hed one day 
when I wa walking back from a 
class and noticed a gray-haired 
gentleman sitting alone at a table 
beneath a tree in front of the Muir 
cafeteria . Wrapped in the protec-
tive veil of purpose, I approached 
him. 

He was wearing his trademark 
dark blue windbreaker and was 
writing some notes on a small pad 
next to an open book. On the 
table, to his right, lay a pocket 
watch divorced of its chain and a 
drained styrofoam cup of what I 
supposed had been coffee.

with experience, react to my 
intrusion upon his academic con-
templations? 

"Excuse me, doctor," I aid 
addre ing him by name and 
introducing myself as a former 
student and now Guardian editor. 

The re ult wa exhilerating: we 
spoke to each other! In fact , we 
had an actual conversation last-
ing about 10 minutes! 

• I suppose it was a fairly ordi-
nary conversation. The story I 
was checking up on was untrue, 
but we talked about personal 
interests and about campus life 
and classroom life and a few 
minor nothings-in-particular and 
then we went our separate ways. 

And I walked around for a 
good part of the rest of tha t day 
with a big grin on my face because 
I had been able to experience 
both the charismatic allure a nd 
the unaffected ope nness of a local 
mild-mannered hero.

San Diego Editors and Journalists Critique Local Media 

"Ho\'. Can San Diego Pre~5 Be Improved?" was the subject of a 
forum held at Peter on Hall on Nov. 15. Que tion were fietded 
by the editors of the UCSD Guardian and discussed by the pane\. 
which included the following journalists and editors. ' 
Richard Kipling ha been the City Editor for the San Diego 
County edition of the Los A ngeles Times for four years. 
Robert Dorn instructs journalism and reportage workshops at 
UCS D . He was a reporter for the San Diego Tribune and then 
left to freelance for tlte Reader and other publications. He has 
recently returned to the San Diego Tribune. 
Maribeth Mellin has been a senior editor at Sail Diego 
Magazine. 
Peter Kaye is the A sociate Edito r of the San Diego Union. 
Richard Louv writes a weekly column for the San Diego Union. 

Kipling: I've been City Editor for 
the San Diego Edition of the 
Times for about four years. Prior 
to that. I was an editor at the San 
Diego Union. So I've been in San 
Diego for a total of eight years. 
I've see n a lot of changes in the 
town. seen a lot of cha nges of the 
newspaper coverage in the town. 
And I hope we'll be able to eluci-
date some of those change and 
change in the community 
Dorn: Yeah. It's Bob. E ru',nr'u 

wanls 10 call me Robert . But . .. I 
spent nine year and nine months 
at the Tribune before I ca me here 
10 teach a couple of writing work-
shops. And I freelance. I sell what 
I can . 
Mellin: I 'm a senior editor at San 
Diego Magazine, been on staff 
for three years. 
Kay : I'm As ociate Editor at the 

an Diego Union. I've also spent 
some time in tele, isionjournalism 

When I first 

AU Sacllplan/ Guardia" 
Maribeth Mellin is a senior editor at San Diego Magazine. 

came to San Diego, about thirty 
years ago I was a reporter for the 
Unioll. My bigge t claim is hiring 
both Richard Louv and Richard 
Kipling. I also spent some time 

.\\orl..ing with Barr~ Goldwater. 
o a pologies, no regrets . 

Louv: I'm responsible for roping 
Peter into coming. I'm a colum-
nist fOT the Union. I've written a 
book; I'm writing another one. 
I've led a checkered career before 
coming to the Union, freelancing 
in the late evenhes for the Reader 
and San Diego MaGazine. 
Guardian: What is wrong with 
the press in San Diego in general? 
What difficulties do you have try-
ing to get across points oJinJor-
mation to the public? 
Kipling: One of the things that's 
wro ng with the pre s in San Diego 
is something that's endemic to 
press and media all over and that 
i we pay attention to just the 
"what" of stories and maybe not 
the "how" and "why." 

Frankly, I don't th ink the press 
in San Diego is all that bad . I 
think there's a lot of competition . 
Incredibly much more competi-
tioo,. than there was eight years 
ago when I arrived. Reponers 
seem to be hungrier, stories are 
jumped on faster. They're not 
forgotten . People try to take a 
story and try to take it funher 
than it seems they used to. But I 
think there are still a lot of "how" 
and "why" questions that are not 
asked. 

The media across the country 
- San Diego is no exception -
tends to gravitate toward meet-
ings , toward government and 
courts. They don't spend as much 
time in the community as they 
might. A lot of that is because we 
feel it incumbent to tell about 
decisions that are taking place 
that are obviously going to' affect 
you. But it's in the communities 

Fifth College Curriculum Has 
An International Orientation 

By ERIC SPRINGER 
Contributing Writer 

Fifth College, UCSD's new-
est college, has collected both 
praise and interest for its unique 
program of undergraduate edu-
cation. Oriented on an interna-
tional perspective, Fifth has 
created a new course and ex-
panded the programs for living 
abroad, in an effort to institute 
its concept of well rounded 
cholastics. 

The official pamphlet on Fifth 
describes the unique educational 
philosophy of the college. "Our 
faculty believes that to be edu-
cated in the world today, stu-
dents must understand their own 
history a nd cultural heritage and 
the history and thought of major 
non-western cultures as well ," 
the pamphlet reads. 

The Fifth College Provost, 
Dr. James Lyon ,commented on 
the curriculum. " We're not in 
thl:! business of training people 
to be engineers, doctors, attor-
ney , biologists, or physicists. 
Our task is to ed ucate people 
who will become those engineers, 
doctors, attorneys, biologi t ,or 
physici ts. 

"The kind of education we 

want to give them is a cross cul-
tural, internationally oriented 
education. Ithink this is vi tal for 
our world today. If we are going 
to survive. we need to know 
about the rest of the world ," 
Lyon said. 

Lyon ack.nowledged that Fifth 
College is different than other col-
leges at UCSD, and the nation 
in general. "We are different for 
two reasons," he said . "First, no 
university that I know of has [a 
course like] Making of the Mod-
ern World [M M W]. Secondly, 
we expect that every undergrad 
will live abroad , either for work 
or tudy. as a part of t he under-
graduate ex perience." 

M M W is an interdisciplinary 
course that combines western 
and no n-western ideas in the 
areas of the humanities and the 
social sciences. It is a six-Quarter 
seq uence that admini trators call 
"comprehensive. " 

Students have different views 
on the subject and a large per-
centage dislike the complexi ty 
and magnitude of the course. 

"It kind of makes you want to 
transfer to any place else, n Fifth 
student Steve Allison said . 

To its credit , the course re-
ceived a grant from the Ford 
Foundation for its excellence. 

Erika Ostrander, another Fifth 
student, commented, "It's tough, 
there is a lot of reading and I get 
bogged down in the coursework, 
but this is worth it because you 
get to study something truly 
in-depth." 

Much more popular among 
the st udent body is the expecta-
tion that all students will live 
a broad . While it is not a require-
ment for graduation, it is "strong-
ly encouraged " by the college. 

To cope with the task of send-
ing the student body en masse to 
foreign countries, Fifth has be-
gun to involve itself in all forms 
of foreign education programs 
that relate to study or work 
abroad . Both university and 
non-university orga nizations are 
involved , and new programs are 
being developed to a llow the 
widest range of possibilities in 
student travel. 

The students of Fifth recog-
nize that theirs is a different 
environment. The dorms are 
often filled with talk of politics 
and c ultures from around the 
world . Lending validity to argu -
ments about the inte rnal politics 
of other countries, students often 
say, ''I've been there , I know 
what it's like." 

where a lot of the c ideas perco-
late up and all too often, we'rcjust 
not there. 

In term of how do we com-
municate better with the com-
munity we're serving ... hey, if 
they'd buy our paper, we'd com-
municate better. If people could 
afford that quarter a day or wha-

. tever it is a week , we would get 
'our message across and there 

would be more feedback from the 
communities . 
Dorn: While I was working at the 
Tribune I still think I can ee it 
- we spent too much time trying 
to package news and from day to 
day had a crisis reaction when-
ever anything breaks. The press 
here could spend more time concen-
trating on preparation and man-
agement. Instead of running 
around putting out fires , they 
should be building some. 

I' would like to see them take a 
more aggre sive view of their role. 
The papers here have an enor-
mous amount of power that 
they're not cxerci ing. 

How to do thi ? In Europe, the 
paper take a different kind of 
approach toward information pol-
icy. They say, "This is a social-
democratic paper," "T\;lis is a 
communist paper," "This is a 
Christian-democratic paper. hAnd 
with that pronouncement, what 
they do with the news is under-
tandable. I'd like to see the papers 

here come out a little more cleanly 
and say, "We believe this and this 
is what we're going to do." Then 
we could make criticism of the 
coverage. Now, we have a kind of 
cloudy problem in identifying how 
the news is being treated , whether 
it's being treated fairl y, because 
we all retreat behind subjectivity. 
Mellin: I would like to see more 
coverage of Mexico. I would like 
to see more treatment of our 
situation as a border town and 

what's going on between Mexico 
and San Diego . I find San Diego to 
be a bit xenophobic. San Diego's 
really closed in upon itself and it 
ca n't be . It's a center in terms of 
growth and border interaction . That's 
an-area I feel is really lacking in local 
news coverage and local feature 
coverage. 

At the magazine, I'm known as 
the gloom-and-doom editor. I'm into 
the gloom and doom stuff. There 's a 
real lack of attention paid to human 
problems, ocial services. We have a 
real bad mental health sys tem in San 
Diego . That's the area where I think 
the press does have some power a nd 
I would like to see it u ed more. 

Guardian: The power to change? 
Mellin: The power to inform. And 
keep informing. I know at least a few 
publications I've worked on, if you 
covered AIDS once every two or 
three years, you've covered AIDS. If 
you've covered child abuse every 
decade, you've covered child abuse. 
I'd like to see it hit a little harder. 
Kaye: I'd like to put this into pers-
pective. When I came to San Diego 
in 1953, the city was barely a city 
then. The Tribune was the dominant 
paper. It had a circulation slightly 
larger than it does now. Aerospace 
was the main industry. The navy was 
very important as it still is. There was 
no UCSD. There was no develop-

"If we are gOing to survive, we need to know about the rest of the 
world," Fifth College Provost Dr. James Lyon said. 

" It's different because most of 
the students here have lived in 
another country. so they are all 
intere ted in more than the Uni-
ted States; they talk about their 
own country too, ~ Ostrander aid . 

"You can learn so much about 
the world just by talking to the 
students . .. 

Fellow student Tali Bar-Sha-
lom agreed . "It's a unique expe-

rience here because you can learn 
so much about so many cultures 
without ever going anywhere." 

Fifth student Paul Wilcox aid 
of the residence halls: "This is so 
personal. It's a community feel-
ing. Here you live in buildings 
instead of just your room." 

Dave Zingarelli, WiJcox'sroom-
mate, summed it up as "the 
ultimate university experience." 

ment in Mi s ion Valley. North 
Cou nt y wa s where we grew. We were 
practica lly pioneers in Del Mar No 
freeway. No 1-5. In other words, it 
was a pretty nice place. 

It was sti ll a pretty small town. It 
was also a very racist city. It was an 
old copperhead town, a civil war 
term, kind of like a Southern city 
itting in the North. The conserva-

tive in the classic sense of not want-
ing to cha nge. They weren't trying to 
go back to an imagined era of some-
thi ng before. The President was 
Eisenhower. The mayor was a young 
Democrat named John Butler. 

Since then there's been tremen-
dous changes. The population then 

was almost completely white. 
And now you look what's hap-

pened . Education, believe it or not, is 
the largest e mployer in the county. 
You're all familiar with the high-tech 
developments with medical and bio-
logical research. I certainly agree 
about Mexico, not only about the 
Hispanics who've immigrated to this 
side of the border but we 're sitting 
next to a city that may be for all we 

• know as big as San Diego but is 
almost invisible as far as people here 
are concerned, and yet we breathe 
the same air, we pollute that same 
air. We share the same problems but 
we don't look at it as our problems. 
We look at it as our problems and 
their problems. That's not the way it 
is . 

The first impression I feel as an 
editor is just to keep up with this. 
Richard Kipling speaks of the diffi-
culty getting out in the communities. 
Dead right. But it's just covering the 
ci ty. What we work for one year isn't 
going to work the next. That's why 
we're fortunate to have somebody 
like Rich Louv who is usually out 
ahead of developments as they 
happen. If we can clone him and 
people like him , I think we'l keep 
ahead. 
Louv: I agree with everything Peter 
just said. I'd like to turn this around 
a little bit. When you have a city in 
which the alternative paper, alle-
gedly, is the Reader, you have to 
wonder about the larger community 
that the bigger papers exist in. I used 
to write for the Reader. I found that 
when I quit writing for the Reader, 
a ngry because they weren 't interested 
in Hispanic issues in the late '7Os, 
tha t the Union, strangely enough, 
the paper that had this right-wing 
reputation, some of it deserved, was 
much more willing to have me do 
that. I found much more intellectual 
freedom on the Union than I've ever 
had at the Reader. 

A bigger problem that is often not 
addre sed is that papers don't exist 
in vacuums. Newspapers exist in a 
wider community and in many ways 
reflect that community. This com-
munity, a Peter said, has grown 
very rapidly, it's very transient. Peo-
ple come here and have to be talked 
into getting a newspaper and feeling 
any kind of co mmitment to the 
wider community. 

The Union now ha orne ads that 
play on tha\. T~j:Y \l.i&Cs th t, a 

home isn't a home without a 
newspaper on the front steps. It's 
kind of like buying a couch. 

Ali Sadiahla,, / Guardian;-;:=~~=~~~~~~~~~ 

It's not just the transiency 
though . You talk to reporter on 
the Union who, some of them, are 
extemely passionate and commit-
ted to what they do. Unlike some 
others, they're not CPAs in dis-
guise. They 'll finish a huge series 
on the homeless or some other 
social issue in which "they some-
times do risky things personally 
to·themselves. And then they pub-
lish this thing and they get all 
these st ra nge letters , and I get 
some of shem, that might as we ll 
be cut out of magazines and pasted 
on the paper. You get letters from 
real crazy people . Every now and 
then you get a really percept ive, 
good letter but the response is 
much less than any of you might 
think it would be. 

P.R. people are winning over journalists , Bob Dorn said. 

I don't think that's true just at 
the Union. T hat 's probably true 
at the L.A. Times, San Diego 
Magazine. 

There's a community surround-
ing these newspapers which do 
not feed the newspapers . It's not a 
one-way deal. 

I went to school at University 
of Kansas and I grew up in Kansas 
City and I worked with some 
small town papers in western 
Kansas before I came here. There 
"ias a real tradition there of small 
town papers that fed reporters to 
the bigger papers. 

In Kansas City, something like 
80 percent of the people take both 
papers morning and evening. 
Penetration is very high there. 
People actually read. 

Here, you don't have ,hat sense 
of commitment. Secondly, you 
don't have this tradition of small 
town papers feeding the larger 
press. Thirdly, you don't have the 

journalism schools feeding and 
critiquing and challe nging and 
pushing the newspapers. 

1 don't know about UCS D and 
the quality of teaching here - I 
know Bob Dorn is a very good 
teacher. I've heard a lot of good 
things from the interns . The 
interns that I've had from UCSD 
have been ve ry good for the most 
part . They haven't necessarily 
known a lot about journalism, 
but there's no journalism school 
here. There should be. 

When I taught magazine writing 
at San Diego, I used to beg 

' Maribeth - I met here there ... 
she came and audited my class -
I used to beg her to keep coming 
to the class. I didn't know she had 
to take a bus from O .B. to San 
Diego State. She was one of the 
few who had anything intelligent 

. or challenging to say. The rest of 
them were j ust trying to get a 
grade and get out and they didn't 
give a damn. 

The thing that discouraged me 
the most was the fact that they 
literally had seniors in journalism 
school who did not know the 
difference between public relations 
and journalism. They didn't know 
the difference. There is not a 
journalism community surround-
ing these newspapers feeding and 

Peter Kaye said San Diego was conservative and racist in 1953.

ever, a very strong public relations 
community in San Diego, and 
they do feed . 
Guardian: What s the difJerence 
between journalism and public 
relations? 
Dorn: One of the reasons people 
out at tate are confused is that 
public relations is taught by the 
journalism department. That's like 
putting foxes and chickens toge-
ther. And I know who the fox is in

Forum 
Continued from pale 11 

A lot of people are leaving 
newsrooms to go into P .R . work. 
It's sort of like training for a 
number of years to mess up the 
waters which you once depended 
upon for your nourishment. 

from public relations people. 
Louv: When I wa in school, we 
literally would not cross the hall 
to talk to the P. R. or advertising 
major , those of u in news/ editor-
ial. There was a literal social 
dividing line. Now maybe that's 
bad but I think in terms of pro-
fe sionalism later, it's probably 
good. 
Kaye: P.R. people obviously are 
advocates of the people who are 
paying them - the construction 
company, the bank, the political 
candidate or whatever. News peo-
ple are supposed to be ... I won't 
use the word "objective. n There's 
no such thing as objectivity. We 
try to be fair, we try to be 
balanced. 

That 's the difference. We're sup-
posed to sort out what the P .R . 
people give us, what we see, what 
we hear and present a balanced, 
factual report. If we do our job 
well, that's what the readers get. 

FEATURES 
yearof my life as P.R. director for 
a chain of banks, what is now 
California First Bank. I hired a 
youngladywhowa the first P .R . 
major at San Diego State. When 
she ca me in there and told me she 
was a P. R. major, I practically fell 
out of the chair laughing. I 
couldn 't realize they would teach 
such a thing. 

She turned out to be very good , 
P.R. people ca n be very useful. 
They don't have horns, they're 
not devils . They're just people out 
there hustling a buck like most 
everybody else in the world . In 
the long run, they serve their 
clients a lot better than the con-
artists and the hustlers. But it's up 
to us in the final a nalysis to sift 
through a ll of that, to sort out 
often opposing P.R. views on an 
issue, plus our own reporting 
which I hope we do. 

Bob, J don't doubt that's what 
happened to you on the Tribune. 

The UCSD Guardian 

One ofthe things that disturbed 
me a great deal when] left the 
Tribune was that shortly after I 
left the premises, a directive went 
out to editors that reporters were 
not to initiate stories, that they 
were to wait for assignments to go 
out on stories. What that does is it 
empowers the public relations peo-
ple. Where does the story come 
from if the reporter doesn't kave 
the building? The paper is largely 
dependent on tips and they come I was working one misspent See FORUM, page 13 Richard Louv found more freedom at the Union than at the Reader.

Forum 
Continued from pale 12 
That's outrageous, obviously. Let 
me assure everybody that we 
welcome our repotters showing 
initiative, coming up with ideas. 
Kipling: Reporters are trying 
to gain access to institutions and 
to information in order to inform 
people and hopefully not just 
with a specific corner of that 
information in mind. P.R. people 
seem to be doing at least two 
things. One is they're trying to 
gain access to us however they 

. can to impart selective informa-
tion. I won't say "disinformation" 
although sometimes it's that too. 
But selective information - in-
formation that is in their favor, 
that protects their institution or 
furthers their institution. 

They are also, and this is what 
Peter was alluding to, in the busi-
ness of defending their institu-
tions, and this is where oftentimes 
we get into some real troubles, 
where we are trying to get at some 
informat ion, gain access to it in 
order to inform, and the P .R. 
person for that information is 
trying to give us only selective 
information that puts that institu-
tion in a good light or in some 
other way defends that institution. 

That's where there's a lot of 
cla~ hing between newspapers and 
other institutions, be they govern-
mental institutions, or private insti-
tutions, non-profit or profit . 
Whether it's a bank or a zoo. 

"I have found often 
with students who intern 
. .. if you give them a 
press release .. . they 're 
real gullible." 

- Maribeth Mellin 

Mellin : P . R. writing is meant 
to convince you of something. It's 
meant to sell you an idea. Journal-
ism should be educating people, 
hopefully. I have found often 
with students who intern at San 
Diego Magazine, if you give them 
a press release as a base of informa-
tion, have them write a piece on 
tbs topic, whatever it may be, 
they're real gullible. They'l just 
read this thing and say, "Oh, this 
thing sounds great! This is wonder-
ful! Just write a clever lead, write 
a nice little piece." 111 ask them, 
"Did you ask whose money is 
paying for this thing?" Or if it's a 
charity thing, where the money is 
going? Where are the percentages 
of the money going? If they're 
going to have a wonderful fund-
raiser, how much money is going 
to people?" 

Those questions just don't 
occur. To me, there's a gullibility 
on the part of the people who are 
receiving the press releases to want 
to believe that. It makes the job 
easier because someone's done all 
the research for you. 

That's much more of a question 
of the journalist. The P. R. person's 
doing their job. It's the journalist's 
job to sort· through it. 
Guardian: Is it the role of the 
colleges to teach that? Or is it the 
role of the publication to teach 
the journalist to ask, " Why?" 
Mellin: It's natural to the person 
to ask "why?" who wants to go 
into journalism in the first place. 
KlpUnl: That's right. Ab olutely. 
That's what you look for. 
Mellin: You have that inbred 
curiosity and ability to look 
around the corner, look around 
the fence and say, "Where's the 
button? Where' the second half 
of the sentence?"

TenUre Denial i 
at VCL 
By HA1\ A CHA DLER 
Slaj! Wnter. DO/II' I:irLIm 

LOS ANGELES - UC LA 
Assi tant profe sor Don Nakani-
shi was denied tenure by the Grad uate 
School of Education (GSE) . As 
of Nov. II he still awa ited a rul ing 
on his appeal of the decision, al-
though UC LA 's C hancellor had 
expected to have one by that date. 

The Asian-American Studies 
instructo r was refused tenure in 
fall 1987. I n Octobe r of that year, 
he filed a grievance against the 
Uni ve rs it y with th e Fa c ulty 
Committee on P riv ilege a nd 
Tenure. T he com pla int clai med 
he was a victi m of racia l bias a nd 
proced ural irregula rities. In J a n-
uary, the committee declared that 
t he origi nal case had bee n 
mishand led. 

Nakanishi filed a second grie-
va nce in April, claiming that Lewis 

olmon, dean of the School of 
Educatiofl, ·'engaged in a deliber-
a te attempt to deny [him] tenure." 

Nakanishi's case has attracted 
t he attention of several campu 
group , a.nd has bee n brought up 
at several discussions on diversity 
at UCLA. 

At an undergraduate govern-
ment meeting last October, Chan-
cellor Charles Young said a deci-
sion on the case would be released 
soon. As of ov. 10 however , no 
official staterr,ent had been made 
about the ca e and no information. 
could be gleaned about its tat us . 

~Personnel processes take a long 
time ," said Stuart Wolpert of 
UCLA's Public Information 
Office. "There's very little anyone 
can say about the casejust DOW." 

Harold Horowitz, Vice Chancel-
lor for Faculty Relations , argued 
that , "personnel action is a delib-
erate process, H and promised that 
Nakanishi's appeal is under re-
view. 

It's very difficult to put a time-
table on these sorts of matters," 
Horowitz said, " 0 there's no way 
to know when the decision [by t he 
Chancellor] will be made." 

If granted tenure, Nakan ishi 
would become the first Asian-
American faculty member of the 
UCLA Graduate School of 
Education. Currently, about 94 
percent of the GSE permanent 
faculty is white. 

Earlier this school year, Na ka-
n ishi cited a letter from UC 
President David Gardner which 
as ked for invigorated efforts to 
improve minority faculty hiring 
as a favorable omen for the ra pid 
resolution of his case . 

Nakanishi could not be reached 
fo r comment after repeated at-
tempts to contact him . 

MEETINGS 
Continued from pale 1 
si nce this report was issued, some 
important changes have been 
implemented by various ca m-
puses. 

"PACUE was impressed with 
the ra nge of campus actions and 
how campuses had matched t he 
[report] findings and recommen-
dations to their particularcampus 
co ntexts," Watson commented . 

He cited such examples as 
UC B, which has developed a 
new interdisciplinary co ur e deal-
ing with social a nd human diver-
sity, as well as the opening of 
UC D' Fifth College and its focus 
on international education.

Tip-Off 
Continued from page 20 
Mudd managed to cut the margin 
to three mainly because of the 
play of All-Tournament team 
member Mike Dawe. However, 
Tim Ra pp iced the game by con-
vert ing two key fo ul shots wit h 32 
seco nds remaining to make the 
core 78-73. 

"We needed to beat a good 
team like Claremont, who has 
been to the Na tiona ls the las t two 
years," Marshall sa id. "Our out-
look looks better as the sea on 
progresses and as we mature." 

The T ritons reached the finals 
by defeating San Jose Bible Col-
lege on Friday, 96-76. Cal Luthe-
ran University won the consola-
tion champion hip. 

The Tritons are currently 2-2 
and will travel to play Whittie r on 
Tuesday. Then, on Dec. 2, the 
Tritons return home to take on 
Point Loma, a game that will be 
free of charge to all students.

p'!rienced players who would no 
doubt ha ve helped the team . 
Marshall said that their loss " has 
to hurt us," but also feels that 
"with the loads of talent we have, 
we're looking to win 18 to 20 
games this year." 

UCSD's season certainly did 
not begin auspiciously, as the 
Tritons lost both games at the 
Claremont-Mudd Tournament. 
Against Claremont-Mudd , the 
Tritons led throughout the game, 
only to lose by four points because 
of several costly mistakes. "They 
(Claremont-Mudd) are a tough 
team but we made too many 
mistakes that cost us a game we 
should have won," Marshall said . 

In the consolation round of the 
tournament, the Tritons led by as 
many as nine points in the second 
half. Then, as Marshall put it, 
"the ball just bounced." Even 
when UCSD blocked out the en-
tire Pacific-Christian team (30-6 
last year), it seemed as though the 
ball somehow "went through our 
legs." 

Still , Marshall , who is in his 
eighth year, is confident about the 
team's future. "We have to get rid 
of the j itters. Once we do, I think 
the team will really sta rt to gel. " 

Most ' recently, the Tri tons de-
feated Sa n Jose Bible and got 
revenge against Claremont-Mudd 
in the Triton Tipoff Tourna ment 
this weekend . (See related story,

Carlos in relentless pl}l'SUit 
of killer Ie. 

At Carlos Murphy's, we consider 
the quest for quality ingredients 
just a part of serving the finest 
fajitas, chimichangas and tacos we 
possibly can. New recipes and 
new ideas in cooking techniques 
have made our salsa spicier, our 

guacamole chwlkier, our tortillas 
tastier, 'and our sauces even richer.

Going into this weekend's 
Triton Tip-Off Tournament, the 
men's ba ketball team needed to 
prove to itself that it could win 
and overcome it inexperience. 
With only three senior and one 
junior on the team, a lack of con-
fidence was beginning to develop 
after two tough los e a week ago. 

According to Head Coach Tom 
Marshall , the Tritons had "played 
scared" in the two defeats, being 
unsure of their winning capabili-
tie . "The team had played with a 
'keep close' attitude instead of 
taking control of the game," he 
said. 

However, UCSD wa able to 
mature in one week and play 
aggressively by capturing fir t 
place in the tournament with a 
82-73 victory over Claremont-
Mudd College. It was the Clare-
mont-Mudd Stags who had beat-
en the Triton by four points la t 
week, but UCSD was able to turn 
things around on aturday night.

Tritons Hope to Gain Experience, 
Continue Success This Season . 

By CHRIS ZAHARIAS

Having recorded 35 win and 
the two best back-to-back years 
in its histor , the UCSD men' 
ba ketball team, under the direc-
tion of Head Coach John Marsh-
all, has all the tool it need to 
build upon that record . 

Foremost among these tools 
are the even returning players 
from last year' quad , Jed by 
senior guard and team captain 
Dan Troy. In his pre eason out-

Head Coach Tom Marshall 

look, Marshall 'aid that Troy will 
be the catalyst for the Tritons'full 
court game. "Dan ha the ability 
to ... raise the overallll<vel of our 
play with his desire," Marshall 
aid. 

Other returnees include enior 
guard Bill Gerlach, who was out 
la t year with an injury, and 
forward Kirk Kramer. Gerlach, 
the team's de ignated defensive 
specialist, has also found hi place 
at the offensive end, averaging 
eight point a game in eason 
opening 10 es to tough Claremont-
Mudd and Pacific Christian 
squads a week ago. 

Probably the Tritons' most 
potent forces are their four re-
turning "supersophs," a Marshall 
refers to them. The result of la t 
year's succe sful recruiting, Tim 
Rapp, Eric Quigley, Gordon 
Mc eill, and Greg Paskewitz all 
hope to make their mark thi 
year. 

Rapp and Quigley, both ca-
pa ble of playing any position, are 
currently starting and averaging 
around 10 point a game. Mc-
Neill, a player who awa total of 
145 minutes all of last year, ha 
played almo (that much already 
this year, underscoring the team's 

youth. Paskewitz, the team's best 
three-point shooter, will probably 
resume playing after an academic 
"shape-up" period. 

Three redshirt will also make 
an impact this year. 5'10" guard 
Darvin Jack on and junior shoot-
ing guard Greg Kund bring much 
needed experience to Marshall's 
program. 6'7" power forward 
Rick Batt, who ' redshirted two 
year ago, and 6'1" guard Peter 
Selleck, who has been backing up 
Troy at the point guard pot, will 
also contribute. 

With the abundance of youth 
on this year's squad, the coaching 
starr biggest problem will be 
getting the players to perform as a 
cohesive unit. "We're a very young 
team, and we just need to get rid 
of the jitters that come from 
having people who didn't play 
much last year," Marshall said . 

Part of the rea onfortheteam's 
lack of experience wa the loss of 
two veteran pl2yer : Andy Wag-
taff and ick apuano. Wag-
taff, who left to put more effort 

into his academics, and Capuano, 
who took up a job offer at a 
commoditie brokerage exchange. 
Both represented talented , ex-
