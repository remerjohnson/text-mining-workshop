Referendum Draws 35%; Results in Doubt

of the 6400 el igible voters . 

Voting Close 
Although the necessary 50% voter turn-out was not 

reached, final tallies for the campus referendum show 
that a majority of voti ng students elected in favor of 
maintaining the Student Activity Fee and of having the 
Student Cooperative recognized as the official student 
body government. 

Voting on whether the Coop should be recognized as 
the representative student body government was close: 
1327 (59%) voted that it should, and 921 (41%) voted no. 

said, Murphy had told him no vote would carry with less 
than 25% of the eligible voters. "inc the Coop had 
received only 21%, Tanana said it had lost. 

Murphy, reached at his home by the Triton Times last 
night, said he had told Tanana nothing of the kind . 

Experiment 

Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Student Affairs George 
Murphy met with members of the Election Board this 
morning to decide how the vote should be interpreted 
since the 50% level wasn't reached. After Murphy and 
the Election Board decide what to do they will send their 
recommenda tions to the Chancellor. 

The 1327 votes to name the Coop UCSD's official 
student government represented 21 % of the eligible 
voters . 

Marco LiMandri, local external affairs coordinator for 
the Coop, commented after the referendum, "I think the 
Coop was an experiment -- 1300 people stated they liked 
it and 900 said they didn't." 

The referendum had to receive a vote of 50% of the 
Student body to assure validity as established by the 
University of California Regents . 

Tom Tanana, leader of the Students for Voluntary 
Action (SV A), primary opponents of the mandatory fee 
and Coop, said after the ballots had been tallied, " I'm 
sorry the mandatory fee went through -..any way you slice 
it, they (the Coop) won. That still doesn't make the 
mandatory fee moral. It's like saying, 'Do nine cannibals 
have the right to eat one cannibal?'" 

Regarding the Coop vote, Tanana said, "It was a close 
race with the Coop and since they didn't muster up 
enough support, they didn't have a large enough margin 
towin." 

LiMandri said he wasn't pleased with the way the 
administration conducted the referendum, because of 
the structure of the student affairs office. LiMandri 
claimed dissatisfaction with the wording of the 
referendum, but added that the Election Board "did a 
great job." 

A total of 2268 of 6400 students voted. 
The mandatory fee question received 1735 votes 

(76V,%) in favor of maintaining the fee, and 533 votes 
(23 V, %) to eliminate it. The 1735 votes represented 27% Tanana last night said the Coop had lost because, he 

LiMandri further stated he thought a better way should 
have been devised to run a referendum . Claiming it didn't 
work, LiMandri said the referendum form of voting on the 
Coop "was an outdated form of legitamization."

Admission to UC medical 
schools in th next two years will 
be more difficult and competitive 
than previously-projected 
enrollment figures hav in-
dicated, th Tnton Times has 
lE'arned 

In what PreSident Hitch termed 
a "di fficuit and compl x task," 
the UniverSity this week sharply 
pared its r quests to the state for 
health ci nce facilities and 
reduced the previously-scheduled 
number of students to be ad-
mitted for m dical training. 

I n a letter sent to Governor 
Brown, Hitch said, "This belt-
tightening is made nece sary 
given existing fiscal constraints 
and priority onsiderations; in the 
long run we- would expect to 
correct the e deficiencies in the 
accommodation of our 
programs." 

48 Fewer Students 

Under the University's revised 
requests for funding' health 
cience programs, 48 fewer 
tudents than the Regents 

previously projected will be 
admitted to UC medical schools . 

This number would be in-
creased dramatically if the 
University clo es its m di al 
chool at Oavi - "a very real 

possibility, " according to Clinton 
Powell , Hitch 's special assistant 
on health affairs . 

The tea hing hospit~1 for the

CALPIRG, RPB Conflict Averted 
, 

A major ontroversy con-
cerning sc heduling of peakers 
between the Revelle Program-
ming Board (RPB) and CALPIRG 
was averted last week behind 
clos d doors. 

The scheduling of Dr. Michael 
D an and Ralph Nader on the 
same night created minor tremors 
between the two groups that were 
quickly quelled by the 
acquiesc nce of the Revelle 
Board . 

According to Helen · Cook, 
member of the RPB, Dean had 
been ~cheduled for the night of 
April 0 for OVE'r two months . A 

rigorOll~ publiCity (ampalgn had 

b n initiated through the u e ot 
posters, pre 5 releases, and word-
of-mouth . 

Only Two Dates 

CALPIRG, The alifornia Public 
I ntere t Research Group, learned 
about three w eks ago that Ralph 
Nader wa available on either 
April 29 or 30. April 30 became 
the definite date two w k ago. 
According to George Murphy, 
Vice Chancellor and Dean of 
Student Affair, it was impo sible 
to Ie chedule Nad r bE'cau e of 
the nature of NadE'r's Itinerary 

The initial rE'action to the 

Nader ch duling was one of 
hock and upset by the RPB. 

B cause of the earlier heduling 
by the RPB, it was felt by its 
memb rs that Michael Dean had 
pr cedence . 

(It is generally Unlver ity 
policy not to chedule two top-
name peakers or performer on

that thi would only be fair to the 
individuals.)

Whe'n the Univer ity con-

tracted last year with the county 
to take over the hospital, it was 
apparently unaware the ho pital 
would impo e such a heavy 
financial burden . 

The University is currently 
negotiating with the county for a 
n w contract that would require 
Sacramento to share more of the 
operating costs. 

Equitable Contracts 

Hitch wrote in the letter that 
unl Sacram nto agrees to an 
" qUitable" contract with the 
Un iv rsity, th medical center 
will be returned to the county. 

"Becau e community re ources

Letters t the Editor 
Spe ial Creation Not Fantastic Myth 

Many pec,p e who have gone through the 
educational pr9cess have been indoctrinated into 
thinking that the Judeo-Christian belief in special 
creation is IlCI more than a fantastic myth. In fact, 
some go so fnr as to say the entire Bible,is a fable 
without regard to the historical and scientific facts. 
This type of person refuses to believe anything that 
does not fit his/her own "personal philosophy." But 
because of scholars from the Jewish historian 
Josephus in the first century AD to archeologist 
W .F. Albright in modern times the Bible is 
becoming more and more credible instead of being 
discarded as a fantasy. 

True science (knowledge gained through 
systemized study and observation) probably will 
never solve the mystery of the origin of the universe 
for the simple reason that it has took place so long 
ago. Dogmatic science claims that it is not 
necessary to prove IF evolution occurred but only 
ttOW it occurred. IF the dogmatic evolutionists 
have so much overwhelming evidence then why is 
it still a theory ~nd not the law of evolution? 

I regret that more people did not attend the 
Creation/Evolution lectures on April 10. The three 
men who spoke were professors of genetics, 
geophysics, and biochemistry and were educated at 
institutions such as Purdue, U of Oklahoma and UC 
Berkeley. They ' presented coherent, scientific 
lectures in their fields of study. The topics were

radiometric dating, creation vs. evolution in 
biology and fossil record. There was NO mention of 
"religious dogma" of any kind. The theory of 
special creation is based in science. 

Just a few of the problems of evolution which 
were brought up in the lectures were : 

How can natural selection be used to support 
evolution when Mendel and others proved that 
even though breeding can cause a limited amount 
of variation within the gene structure, the species 
always remains the same species. ("Once a pea 
plant ... ") 

Out of the thousands upon thousands of fossils 
science has obtained (not All of the fossil record 
by any means) not one has been shown to be of an 
intermediate or transitional form . If every life form 
has been in a constant state of evolution since the 
beginning of time at least one or two of the found 
fossils should show it. 

If evolution were true and it takes, say, a million 
years for reptile's fore legs to evolve into wings, 
what would happen to the animal when the 
transition was midway and it could not use it limbs 
for either walking or flying? He would be extremely 
vulnerable-a prime candidate for extinction. 

Accordi ng to evolution is ts, man evolved from 
the lower primates about 100,000 years ago. They 
set up a chronology using fragments of the remains 
of sub-human species. (everyone has seen the 
"Time-Life" chart with the Home erectus etc.) But 
there was a recent (not so publicized) discovery of a 
complete skull virtually identical to modern man 
that was dated to be about 3 million years old. 
According to RiLhard Leakey, the discoverer, "The 
entire theory of evolution must be re-evaluated." 

I cannot speak for everyone but I would rather 
rely on the "whim" of an all-knowing, all-powerful 
creator than on the "throw of the dice" for a logical 
explanation . 

BRENT WARREN 

University Under Brown and Saxon 
by Karen M. Steentofte 
Ext.rnel Aff.i re, Stet_ide 
UCSD Student Coop.retl". 

Anticipating the effect of the 
new governor and the new 
president on the University of 
California is rapidly becoming a 
number one pastime. 

Four months of Edmund G. 
Brown Jr., as a Regent and eight 
months of David Saxon as a part-
time University Provost in 
University Hall has not made the 
speculation any more conclusive. 

David Saxon is a quiet man 
whose most publicized 
achievement to date is his refusal 
to sign the UC loyalty oath in 
1950. He does appear to love Uc. 
In this presentation before the 
Board of Rt:·gents in September he 
depicted the fine heritage of this 
institution so well , that if you 
were listening, you got a lump in 
your throat as if you were at 
graduation. Whether this love will 
benefit the University or simply 
help Saxon rationalize the in-
stitutions' shortcomings remains 
to be seen . 

Brown, who quipped severa l 
times during his campaign for 
governor that he was at UC 
Berkeley in the sixties professes a 

similar love for the University of 
California and its high quality, 
but he does not appear to hold 
the same feeling for its ad-
ministration . Brown has badgered 
the Board at Regent meetings 
with what are often trite but 
useful questions. He asks why 
things can't be simplified, why 
adm i n istrators' salaries are so 
high, and why the University uses 
so much paper. On the Board his 
tone vacillates between that of a 
naive boy who can't understand 
the complexity of the Board of 
Regents and that of a strong 
decision-maker who explains, 
with regard to the budget, that 
the University will be stronger if it 
doesn't always get what it wants. 

Besides the questions and the 
vacillating posture, the effect of 
Jerry Brown on UC is the budget. 
Pleading economic hard times, 
the Governor cut the Extended 
University and the Riverside 
biomedical programs and refused 
to use State funds for some 
previously Registration Fee-
funded programs and Affirmative 
Action . He appeared to be fairly 
kind to the University until he 
accepted all cuts proposed by the 
Legislative Analyst's office and

none of the additions . All in all 
Brown appears neither out to get 
the University with an overly tight 
budget, nor willing to let the 
University live high on the hog. 

The disquieting aspect of the 
Brown administration is that even 
though Brown appears personally 
interested in higher education, he 
has no post-secondary education 
advisor, and as of the middle of 
March the new director of Post-
Secondary Education Com-
mission had been unable to get 
an appointment with Brown. 
When members of the Student 
Body Presidents' Council asked to 
speak with him about Affirmative 
Action (which he stated was a 
"people" not a "monetary" 
problem when he refused to fund 
it) he agreed, but the meeting 
ended ten minutes after it began 
with some very frustrated student 
body presidents who had shared 
the meeting with two TV cameras 
and approximately 15 reporters . 
Brown does not appear to be a 
very good listener. 

President-designate Saxon 
expects to gain the Governor's 
ear. In the new organizational 
chart, Saxon has eliminated the 
Vice President of Governmental 
Relations, the administrations' 
lobbyist in Sacramento, and 
replaced it with a coordinator. It 
is presumed that Saxon expects to 
fill this gap himself, a new role for 
the President. Brown has stated 
that he does respect Saxon, 
though they do not always agree . 
Perhaps relations between the UC 
President and the Governor will 
improve from past years, but it is 
hard to envision Saxon making 
the day to day contacts 'in the 
legislature that the Vice President 
had done. 

As a candidate for the pOSition 
of PreSident, Saxon was viewed as 
a continuer of the status quo. 
Being a member of Hitch's ad-
ministration, he was expected to 
continue in the manner of 
President Hitch. His r cently 
released organizational hart of 
the UC administration and the 
Office of the President indicate 
that he might have more changes

Murphy Replies to Hall ' 
~etter Against Creation 

I would like to thank Norman 
Hall for his reply to my challenge 
of the theory of evolution. I 
would like to defend my stance 
on ~his issue. First of all, creation 
predicts an absence of tran-
sitional forms in contrast to 
evolution, which maintains that 
transitional forms existed in the 
past. It is logical to assume that 
evidence of their existence 
should be found in the fossil 
record. At least Charles Darwin 
seemed to think so, " But, as by 
this theory innumerable tran-
sitional forms must have existed, 
why dq we not find them em-
bedded in countless numbers in 
the crust of the earth /" 

I he paleontologist George 
Gaylord Simpson comments 
about this matter, "This is true of 
all thirty-two orders of mam-
mals ... the earliest and most 
primi tive known members of 
every order already have the 
basic ordinal characters, and in 
no case is an approximately 
continuous sequence from one 
order to the other known . In most 
cases the break is so sharp and 
the gap so large that the origin of 
the order is speculative and much 
disputed." Again he states, "This 
regular absence of transitional 
forms is not confined to mam-
mals, but is an almost universal 
phenomenon, as has long been 
noted by • paleontologists." 
Mr. Hall quotes Dodshansky as 
saying, ':the chief interest of 

paleontological data .. .lies not in 
their demonstration that 
evolution did occur, but in their 
showing of just how it occurred ." 

This is totally and completely 
erroneous! The exact opposite is 
true and paleontological data 
shows that evolution did not 
occur in the extreme case as 
supposed by modern biology ! 
After supposed billions of years of 
evolution, the fossil record 
should at least contain a few 
examples of transitional forms . 

Dr. Duane Gish, wh'O lectured 
here on creation, says in his book 
Evolution, The Fossils Say 

No:~. every one of the major 
invertebrate forms of life have 
been found in Cambrian rocks. 
These animals are so highly 
complex it is conservatively 
estimated that they would have 
required 1.5 billion years to 
evolve ... However, when we turn 
to examine the Pre-Cambrian 
rocks for the forerunner of these 
Early Cambrian Fossils, they are 
nowhere to be found ... At their 
earliest appearance, these major 
invertebrate types were just as 
clearly and distinctly set apart as 
they are today ... " 

I would like to close with an 
open question, if creation is a 
myth, why then is it so well 
supported by the fossi I record? 

DAVE MURPHY 

TT Misses With Heimler 
Via its columniSts, a newspaper has a chance to rise above the 

embarassingly plain, dull, and unimaginative journalism which per-
vades most of its pages . The Triton Times has chosen to spotlight 
Charles Heimler in Monday's column . I can only assume that the 
management felt Mr. Heimler's article had the qualities of wit, in-
telligence, and purposefulness to make it more profitable to the 
readership (and the paper) than some sort of paid advertisement. 

I am deeply disappOinted and quite convinced that the Triton Times 
has no desire of becoming a legitimate, readable newspaper.

COMBO Supports San Diego Arts; 
Students Have Mandeville Priority 

I n a Letter to the Editor 
published in the Triton Times for 
April 18, reference was made to 
the use of space in the Man-
deville Center by COMBO. The 
following information might be of 
interest to your readers : 

1. COMBO is a San Diego 
organization that raises money to 
support the arts . Without the 
funds obtained by COMBO, the 
San Diego Symphony, the Old 
Globe, the San Diego Opera, The 
San Diego Fine Arts Gallery, and a 
n umber of other enterprises 
would either go under or be 
forced severely to restrict their 
offerings 

2. The COMBO fund-raising 
event in the Center was open to 
those who bought tickets . The 

funds, of course, were for the arts. 
3. No campus organization 

applied to use the space occupied 
by COMBO on that particular 
evening. For a while during the 
winter quarter it was being held 
for a music event which was 
cancelled . 

4. Student groups have already 
made e~tensive use of Center 
space. Just the night before the 
COMBO event a student 
organization presented a large 
program in the auditorium to 
elebrate Israeli Independence 

Day. Off-campus groups enjoy 
the last priorty when it comes to 
det rmining how use of the 

ent r is scheduled.

Muir Provost 

Wednesday, April30,l975 Triton Times 
By Patti Wolf 

CoPY Edhor 

The Muir College Council (MCC), acting on 
recommendations by the Muir Curriculum Review 
and Development Board (MCRDB). has reached a 

stressing oral presentation skills, a writing sequence 
going beyond Subject A level competency, and a 
course similar to Revelle 's Frontiers of Sr,ience, 
presenting a broad knowledge of the sciences, were 
thought to be worthy of general education in-
clusion . 

MCRDB recommendations additionally approved 

The Muir Reporter 
con~nsus on five points that may be incorporated 
in the Muir general education requirements 
beginning next year . 

If implemented, the decisio(ls will create a survey 
course oriented, more unified CE program. 

The points specifically endorsed by the Council 
include a mandatory requirement that each general 
education sequence include either a writing project 
or an oral presentation at some point in the 
sequence. Sequences must present- a segment or 
process involving the student in the professional 
practice of the field , such as stage work in drama, 
or laboratory work in physical science. An un-
derstanding of the historical development of the 
field is to be included in the instruction, and 
students must be shown how a sequence relates to 
the rest of the field , with specific indications of 
what course work could be appropriately pursued if 
the student desires. 

by theMCC included the mandatory requirement of 
a course syllabus, a final examination or approved 
alternative (both to be sent to the MCRDB), a 
student course evaluation and the use of reading 
material or approved alternative, for all Muir 
general education classes . 

Need For Smaller Classes 
MCC attention also focused on general education 

c lass size, evaluation of TAs and the development 
of additional interdisciplinary courses . The need for 
smaller classes, at least one reduced general 
education class size per quarter, was emphasized . 

New Areas 
Included in the MCC report was the recom-

mendation that new areas be developed into 
genera l education sequences. A speech program. 

Earlier T A evaluation, around the second week of 
the quarter, was proposed . And an increased 
number of interdisciplinary courses, to be sub-
stituted for one of the GEs was suggested . However, 
a lack of money for smaller classes and a lack of 
professor interest for development of in-
terdisciplinary sequences were cited as road blocks 
to the new requests . 

The responses must now be acted upon by the 
MCRDB, which sent the proposals to the MCC at 
the beginning of winter quarter.

Poli Sci Union 

Political science majors have banded together Into a new student

together by the faculty members and students in order to serve as an 
educatIOnal tool and a communication forum . 

There are now 60 declared Political Science majors, but only two full 
professors . The department is planning to add two full time professors 

ne~t year and the union is hopeful that its voice will influence the 
selection of the new professors . The questions asked by the union at 
this pOI nt concern the criteria for the hiring of professors . 

UsuallY, the union meets on Wednesday. However tomorrow at 3 pm 
the chairman of the department, Sanford Lakeoff, will address the 
union in the Revelle formal lounge. 

In the future , the PSSU hopes to spons'or lecutures, speakers, and 
various campus wide services. The union is open not only to political 
science majors all interested students are welcome.

" I 'm Against It" 

Coblentz, when told of Hitch's 
intention to build the on-campus 
hospital, said, " I'm against it. I 
don't think a 200-bed hospital is 
economically viab le ." 

He liaid the University should

will encounter problems at 
Orange County similar to those 
experienced at Sacramento ,

the Irvine medical school and 
transfer Irvine students to other

I Theatre: Larry Deckel ~ 
She Stoops to Mandeville 

It's baffling. San Diego IS the second largest city 
in California, and yet, it has yet to find its way to 
t!~labllshing a solid source of professional theatre . 
One is about as likely to encounter excellence in 
theatre here as find a gourmet meal in the Revelle 
cafeteria . 

Wh ich brings us round to the appearance of the 
City Center Acting Company (CCAC) in the 
Mandevi lle center - like the cropping up of a well-
executed steak night in the cafeteria. The food is so 
much better than what you are accustom d to 
eating here that it's a pleasure, a surprise, and a 
delight. 

Fresh Air 

Culi nary metaphors aside, the CCAe's per-
formance of Goldsmith's "She Stoops to Conquer" 
last weekend was a breath of fresh air in the San 
Diego thea tre experience. San Diego theatre (The 
Old Globe, the Cassi us Carter, the now defunct Off-
Broadway, and the miscellaneous community-
theatres) lacks strong acting and directing. City 
Center brought these qualities with them in spades. 

That's certain ly what made the evening the 
pleasure it was. Restoration comedy generally 
suffers on the stage from an inability to come to 
life. Either lack of ability makes it flabby , historical 
comedy, or the incorporati~n of extreme stylization 
makes it a study in choreography and avoids 
meeting head-on with the problems of character in 
text. 

City Center, on the other hand, took the play by 
the horns and hurled it out into the audience. 
Excellent diction and vocal work brought the 
comp lex text into easy accessibi lity, making the 
complicated plot seem easy and graceful. A 
consistently strong sense of character development 
graced the company with the rare compliment of 
no weak performances (avoiding the usual pitfall of 
th'e "Oh, I wish this scene was over so that the 
funny guy would come on again" syndrome .) The 
use of stylization in movement and expression was 
tasteful and not in excess, and the general energy 

and activity level of the company on stage was 
invigorating to watch. 

Too Safe 

All thi s is not to say, however, that a steak night 
in the Revelle Cafeteria is a gourmet meal. While 
the entire evening was solid and dependable, I 
couldn't help but feel it was just a little too safe. 
The marks of excellence in theatre extend beyond 
dependability. Rather, what is needed is a se n~e of 
s tretc h, risk, and creativity beyond the ca ll of 
expectation. And here, CCAC fell a bit short. As 
good as it was, I fe lt a cer tain smugness of control 
in safe work . 

Furthermore, while the evening was perhaps the 
fi nest performance work we've seen here in some 
time, the same cou ld not be said for the evening's 
technical aspects. Backs tage noises, awkward set 
changes, a very artificial quality to the music, and 
occasional insecurity of lighting marred things a 
bit. 

One could attribute a lot of this to the problem of 
adapting to the Mandeville stage . The massive 
stage sort of swallowed the travelling set which 
fou nd itself uncomfortably wedged between 
Mandeville cur tains . While strong voices countered 
any acoustic difficulties the buildi ng might possess, 
nothing much could help those sight lines, and 
intermission saw the now famous Mandeville 
musica l-chair sea t shuffle In effect, with everyone 
vyi ng for a chance to find a place where they could 
ee . Why the seats in the orchestra, unfortunatel y 

placed at the same level, aren't staggered to 
enhance seei ng around heads is beyond me A 
future investment in a more complexly raked or-
chestra seating secti on couldn 't do that building a 
bit of harm. 

But why do I even begin to complain? Despite 
possible petty grievances one cou ld pick with the 
evening, it was sti ll the nicest theatre work I've seen 
in a long time, and assured acting is a pleasure to 
see any time. Competence is competence and I' ll 
take steak night in the cafeteria as often as they' ll 
offer it.

than previously 

. The effect of his reorganization 
of University Hall is hard to 
predict because one key position, 
that of Vice-president of 
Academic Affairs , is not yet filled . 
Saxon has made this a 
superhuman position by placing 
everyt hing from Academic 
Planning, Programs and Policies 
to the University Press under the 
new VP purview. 

Another change in University 
Hall is the title of VP Bob 
Johnson. Previously the Vice-
president of University and 
Student Relations . As to what 
kind of change that is suppose to 
produce, your guess is as good as 
mine. Where Saxon will placE' the 

Office of the President in the 
deciSion-making line is probably 
his most concrete hange. Saxon

has moved the Office of the 
President from equal footing with 
the Chancellors to one of a more 
taft position . This move gives the 

Chancellors more say in 
University Hall and thereby 
increases campus autonomy. 

Saxon is predicted to be a 
President . who knows how to 
judiciously tighten his belt . He is 
rt'ported to admire UC Los 
Angeles and Berkeley as great 
institutions and to be committed 
to their continued excellence 
ven at the expense of the smaller 

campuses. He views redundancy 
as wasteful and therefore will 
probably allow more and more 
decisions to be made solely on 
the campus level. Saxon ap-
parently sees a great deal of his 
time spent in Sacramento im-
proving relations with the State 
government. 

How will the State government, 
specifically Jerry Brown, react to 

this? With more questions that he 
will not walt to hear answered? Or 
will Brown become tired of the 
University and let a man he 
respects do his job as President? 

Although no one can ac-
curately predict if Brown and 
Saxon themselves even know the 
direction they are taking the 
University, one thing is apparent . 
Regent meetings are much more 
interesting than they used to be.

-----Women's Tennis-----
r Winning Isn't All 1 

by Jim Nuckols 
S,-ffWrlter 

Lisa Seegmiller would be the 
first to admit that out of 22 girls 
on this year's UC San Diego 
Women's Tennis team she doesn't 
rank much higher than twentieth . 

But there she was Monday, in a 
match against USIU, playing on 
the No. 1 doubles pairing. Sur-
prising? To the Vince ("Winning is 
everything") Lombardi diSCiples it 
might be, but to Coach Chris 
Mattson and her team it's far from 
it. Seegmiller's case just serves to 
illustrate the attitude and spirit 
that Coach Mattson has 
established; winning may be 
important, but it is not what is 
most important. 

UCSD Winning 

This idea may appear to be a 
misguided one in an athletic 
world that sees Jimmy Connors 
and John Newcombe play for 
millions and football coaches 
preaching " Win at all costs." 

Not that they aren't winning 
too. UCSD stomped USIU in the 
match to notch their third win 
against four narrow defeats, and 
gives them a chance to even their 
season record against USD, May 
6. 

There is a problem, though . 
According to the San Diego 
Women 's Intercollegiate Athletic 
Association (SDWIAA), the team 
is 0-7, because one of the players 
was declared tneligible. The 
player in question, Ann Coishi, is 
now In her fourth and final year 
of intercollegiate competition . 
However, according to a disputed 

SDWIAA rule, a woman can play 
no more than three years. At the 
beginning of the year, the team 
voted to retain Ann on the squad, 
even though it would make them 
ineligible and force them to 
officially forfeit all their games. 
The team deserves com-
mendation for holding an in-
dividual's right to play over 
winning. 

The recent match with USIU 
was typical. In order to let others 
compete, the top two singles 
players, Meg Siegler and Ellen 
Cates, didn't play. Ann Coishi 
went on to win the No. 1 singles 
duel 6-0, 6-2; Marian Stephenson 
took the No. 2 singles 6-4, 6-2; the 
No. 3 singles victory went to 
Marian Hsu 6-3, 6-2; and the 
doubles title went to Laurel Hyde, 
and yes, 20th ranked Lisa 
Seegmiller. 

Hats off to Chris Mattson and 
her team. If you want to see the 
biggest winners on campus in 
action, come watch the AII-
Conference tournament May 9 
and 10 at the Muir Courts.

During any sun lit hour of the day, chances are 

that there is a softball game in progress on campus. 
Next to the activity during the fall flag football 
season, spring quarter is perhaps the busiest time of 
the : year for the Muir field . 

No small wonder . 
This year there are over 130 teams participating 

in the most popular intramural sport offered at UC 
San Diego. Of those teams, 70 are coed and 63 are 
men's teams . 

The teams are divided into 19 leagues of seven' 
teams per league. Figuring an average of at least 11 
persons per team, there are roughly 1500 persons 
involved' with softball , or almost 25 percent of the 
student population . 

With such a large involvement, not only are the 
two fields at Muir used, but two additional fields on 
Matthews campus see play . Cames are held 
throughout each afternoon seven days a week . 

Axe and Boatfolk 
Leading the way in the men's league are two 

undefeated teams in the A league. Axe and 
Boatfolk, two perenial teams have had little 
trouble in dispersing their opponents . 

The coed league has seen the arrival of a new 
team that has entered competition in hopes of 
displacing some of the older and well established 
teams . The Viki ngs will be attempting to upset 
teams like Old Bats, Batters Box, Frogs and Passion 
Flower. The Flower has been around for a few 
seasons, led by six year veterans Nancy Acton and 
Linda Maczko. 

After all the softball games have been concluded, 

the action shifts indoors for coed innertube 
water polo. For many of the teams involved, the AII-
Cal tournament at Riverside is the primary pre-
occupying thought. The list of teams that will vie to 
represent UCSD has been narrowed to two. Un-
derwater Cheapshots and Wet N' Slippery will face 
each other Friday at 4 p.m. to decide on who will 
make the trip . 

As always, the top league presents the toughest 
competition, with people like Corky Hull of the All 
Stars and Ann Searcy of Surface Tension leading 
thei r teams . 

Floor Hockey 
Equally as 'competitive is floor hockey. In the 

coed league, preseason favorite EI Chunko has been 
performing as expected . EC boasts perhaps the best 
contingent of women, as exemplified by leading 
female scorer Kerry Dunne who has scored f ive 
goals in two outings . Her total would put her in 
third place in scoring overall in the league. Leading 
the league in scoring is Dan Crane of Lex and Keith 
Kranz of the Untitled XII , with seven goals apiece. 

The men's league has proved to be tougher in its 
second quarter of action . Orgy is leading the league 
with team defense and EI Chunko in team offense. 
Coaltending has proved to be tougher as teams 
improve. Other Sports 

The 1M department hasn't stopped with il,lst three 
spring sports. There is also indoor soccer, three man 
basketball and coed volleyball . Because of the wide 
variety of offerings there is a chance that there is 
something for anybody with any athietic in-
clinations.

Noted M exican archaeologist, Professor Jose' 
Carcia Canasta, while digging at the ancient Aztec 
ruins of Pe40ta -I tza high in the Yucatan. unearthed 
an ornate ceremonial urn bearing the image of 
Chime-U'- Stash, primitivt::: god of card pla\.fing- The 

Professo r surmised that a generous portion of 
ever\.f game's winnings were sacrificed irretrievabl\.f 
into this vessel to temper Chime-U'-Stash's insati-
able appetite_ The winning i seems (upon investi -
gati ng the urn 's contents) were various, 
highl\.f-prized. mind -altering substances which were 
extremel\.f well-preserved and sampled. for science's 
sake, b\.f the Professor_ 

Soon afterwards. in an amazing displa\.f of m\.fstical 
guidance, Professor Canasta deciphered the urn' s 
unintelligible hierogl\.fphicS and recorded this phen -
omenal stor4_ 

On a mugg\.f Saturda4 night (approx. 225 A_ D.' three Aztec warriors were pla\.f-
ing an apparentl4 serious card game called Mo' -Mo-Ma\.fa_ The stakes were high. 
Not onl4 the best pe\.f0te. weed. mushrooms. and poppi. but also an everpresent 
though extremel4 remote possibilit\.f of being dealt the ~ R04al Flash." a dreaded 
hand of cards which. according to Aztec m4tholog4. meant the immediate bodil\.f 
sacrifice of its holder to Chime- U -Stash. This quick-tempered deit4. eliminating 
t he middleman. performed the sacrifice himself presumabl4 via lightning bolt or 
similar cosm ic apparatus. Well. to make a long legend short. it happened. On a 
one card pick-up. the unfortunate warrior completed the unprecedented ~Flash"-
