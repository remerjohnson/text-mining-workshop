BY KATHY HUFFER 
Vice Chancellor of Student 

Affairs Richard Armitage has 
announced that he will leave 
his post, adding to t.he flurry 
of resignations that have 
taken place since summer. 

Armitage cited "personal 
family matters" as reasons 
for his resignation, which 
will take effect next August. 

His announcement came 
the same day that Jeremy 
Charlton Quit his post as 
Associated .students presi· 
dent, and follows the 
resignations of several other 
AS officers and biologist Ian 
Kennedy. 

And while all the 
resignations have occured 
ince the July arrival of 

Chancellor Richard Atkin· 
son, Armitage said yesterday 
that the incidents do not 
reflect any conflict with the 
new UCSD head. 

Armitage's 65·mile daily 
commute to and from campus 
is his primary reason for 
resigning, he aid. His wife 
commutes from Los Angeles 
to their home in Mission 
Viejo each day, "and we're 
spending too much -time on 
the freeways," he said. 

Armitage said he first 
decided to leave his post last 
spring, soon after he and his 
wife moved to their present 
home. After notifying then· 
chancellor·elect Atkinson of 
his intensions, Armitage 
withheld announcement of 
his resignation until the new 

According to Barbera, the 
group plans to disrupt the 
registration process by 
blockading post offices and 
submitting unnecessary and 
false registrations in hopes of 
"totally screwing up the ' 
system." 

Topkis takes reins 
as Charlton leaves 

Also present at the meeting 
were attorneys Kathy 
Gilberd and Ted Bumer of the 
National Lawyers' Guil~, 

Gill gave 
fair shake 

Gordon Gill repeated 
yesterday his belief that 
the Institutional Biosafety 
Committee gave Dr. S. Ian 
Kennedy a fair shake in 
their investigation into 
charges that Kennedy 
cloned a virus pro cribed 
by the National Institutes 
of Health. 

Gill, chairman of the 
IBC, defended hi commit·

Just 48 hours ago, Bill 
Topkis was a happy man as 
AS vice president. Then, at 
11:30 am on Wednesday, the 
word came. 

That evening, Topkis 
assumed the AS presidencr, 
in the wake of "silly student' 
Jeremy Charlton's resigna· 
tion. 

And it is ironic that last 
April, Topkis had considered 
running for AS president, but 
quickly decided that he 
would better compliment 
Linda Sabo as a vice 
presidential candidate on her 
"Srudent Interest Not 
Special Interests" slate. 

Sabo lost her bid again t 
Charlton, but Topki handily 
defeated his opponent, Jan 
Bre lauer. 

All thi weigh heavily on 
Topkis' mind a he eek to 
put back together an AS 
Council that ha een five 
resignations ince its 
inauguration last June. 

"I was hocked when 
Jeremy resigned. I aw him 
talking to Randy (Woodard) 
and then I found out," Topkis 
says. 

But he doesn't dwell upon 
the past as the tasks that 

await him "are going to be 
difficult" to handle. 

"There are going to be 
problems," he says, "but I 
think we can work as a 
cohesive team." 

Topkis' first undertaking 
is the appointment of five 
new council members - vice 
president, commis!)ioner of 
elections, director of public 
relations , SCURI director 
and commissioner of 
communications - all 
within the next two weeks. 

For commissionerships 
and directors hip , Topkis 
ays he is looking for orne 

fresh faces, perhaps someone 
not previously associated 
with the AS. "We need 
omeone with enthu iasm 

and or~anizational back· 
ground,' he ays, noting that 
"my roots come from tudent 
or~anizations . and rm not 
gomg to forget that." 

The ituation is different 
with the appointment of a 
new vice president, however. 
"I have four individuals in 
mind at this time, but the list 
is by no means closed." 

Topkis is considering 
Warren Wheeler, Ernie 

p1eue tum to pale 4 

chancellor had assumed 
office, he said. 

A former Latin American 
literature professor and a 
student affairs administrator 
for 10 years, Armitage said he 
also wanted to resume part· 
time teaching and research. 

Mixed surprise 
Armitage's announcement 

met with mixed surprise 
from students, administra· 
tors and staff. Although he 
has publicly stated since he 
became vice chancellor three 
years ago that he would 
retain the position for only a 
few years, some members of 
the university were sur· 
prised. 

Student Center Director 
Roland Buck aid he "was 
very surprised, shocked in 
fact" when Armitage told his 
staff of his plans. "It took 
almost everyone by sur· 
prise," Buck said. 

And Bill Topkis, new AS 
president, said the combina· 
tion of Armitage's and 
Charlton's resignations were 
"a double smack." 

However, many students 
said they had expected 
Armitage's decision to leave. 
Some, in fact, said his 
retirement has already 
begun. "He's been retired for 
a long time," commented 
Progressive Coalition 
member Jon Bekken. 

Bekken explained that the 
63·year·old vice chancellor 
has "avoided decisions ... and 
delegated responsibilities to 
avoid making decisions" 
since his arrival here from 
Ohio State Universitv 
three years ago. . 

"Nearly every decision he's 
made has in fact been made 
by an underling," Bekken 
charged.

Muir Council meets with

BY JEFFREY S. LEE

In an air of frustration , the 
first Muir College Council 
meeting of the quarter got 
under way last night to 
di scu ss posting · policy 
cha nges, Muir campus 
conduct boards and other 
college related items. 

But mo t importantly, Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affair 
Richard Armitage wa 
pre ent to defend the draft of 
a new Regi tration Fee 
Advi ory Committee propo· 
al to the member of the 

council. 
Armitage was quick to say 

that he "introduced the 
proposal," but "it is not my 
proposal. " 

"Many years ago when I 
first came here there were 
problems (with the Reg Fee 

Committee) and man 
tudents came to me ... with 

gripes and comp,laints about 
the procedures, ' he said. 

He went on to say that 
under the "old plan" he 
wanted to work with the 
student on what to do with 
the Reg Fee money, but that 
many faculty members 
thought that tudents "had 
too much power." Under the 
old sy tern, the administra· 
tion ended up "hiding the 
facts, playing games .and 
holding back opinion on 
what to do with the money. 
"They were not giving the 
tudents the full story," he 

said.

r thebottom11De I They have told me that I do not belong 
BY JEFFREY S. LEE 

I feel like I am ~ught in a 
web of confusion and 
frustration . I do not 
understand. I try to see what 
is happening to me but it still 
does not make sense. My 
name has been read off a list 
in the hands of the TA. 

"I am to go where?" To 
some room across the way. 
Away. I ·do not listen to the 
name of the room, or what 
time it meets. I have been told 
by ,a list in the TA's hands 
that I do not belong. 

I rise from my seat, not 
knowing quite what has 
happened, and leave the 
room. I am to go to that other 
room, full of people. Away. 

I walk down the hall and 
down the stairs and out into 
the hazy sunshine from 
above. I do not belong. I walk 
very slowly, and 1 do not 
know where I am going. [am 
just ~ing. 

I SIt on a bench somewhere 
in the hazy sunshine to think. 

Questions rise from the 
'bottom of my mind. "Why?" 
And, "Who did thi to me?" 
The list in the hands of the 
Let is associate tditor for the 
Daily Guardian. 

TA has done this to me. It 
said that I did not belong. 

More questions float into 
view, and a conversation 
starts up in my head. "I 
should be in that class. I got 
an 'A' in Lit 25 last quarter." 

"You haven't done well 
enough on the test that was 

given to you t he firs t day of 
c1asse to tay in that c1as ." 

"But that test was all 
~ammar. How can they 
JU tify their actions of 
moving people around on 

'lists' for literature classes on 
that basis?" It's like giving 
students a short English 
Grammar test to see if they 
can take Modem Fict ion I, 
and if they fail then putting 
them in the History of 
Science Fiction." 

The feelings of confusion 

and fru tration give way to 
anger. Anger. They have 
taken the score from the 
grammar test and made a 
judgement about me. They 
have told me that 1 do not 

belong. They have made t~e There was no explanation as

class. 
The test itself was a real 

gem. Fill in the blank with 
only one word. Write another 
entence with the words 

given. and follow the model. 

Fine. That's just fine. 
There has always been 

problems with the Lit 
department here, but now 
they are saying that if you 
don't remember every little 
bit of grammar after a three· 
month summer break, you 
get put back down the ladder. 

The person responsible for 
much of this is a new 
professor, and I guess she 
wants to do everything she 
can for the students. She was 
charged with supervising the 
French Lit department here, 
and ~an making things 
"better. 

She is the one who made 
the lists. She is the one who 
made the decision to move 
people around. She is the one 
who did not talk to the 
students , or tell the TAs to 
explain everything. 

Perhaps she was afraid

Tenative agreement 
made in'actors' strike 

HOLLYWOOD - A 66-
day strike by actors which 
delayed the start of the] 980 
fall televi s ion season 
appeared near an end 
yesterday when negotiators 
for two unions and the 
producer reached a tentative 
agreement on a three-year 
contract. 

But some rank·and·file 
actor said they weren't 
happy with t he pact, and still· 
st riking member of the 
American Federation of 
Musicians said they would 
step up picketing at major 
tudio. 
At best , the major 

networks aid it would be six 
to eigh t weeks before 
unfinished television 
programs could be com pleted 
after the actors return to 
work. 

If the 67,000 combined 
members of the Screen 
Actors Guild and American 
Federation of Television and 
Radio Artists approve t he 
new contract, they will end 
the longest strike in t he 
history of their unions. The 
actors walked off thejobJuly 

21. The settlement was 
reached at 5 a.m. PDT after 
an 18 Ih- hour negotiating 
es ion . 

"/ have mixed feeling 
a bout t he tentative settle· 
ment. " said actor Ed A ner, 
the no-nonsen e city editor 
on the "Lou Grant" TV 
series. " I felt that was not a 
victory in any ense at all." 

But A ner aid the actors 
probably would ratify the 
agreement. "People are tired 
of being out of work, and 
being blamed for so much 
suffering - and it's all laid at 
our doorstep," he said. 

Actor wi ll vote by mail on 
whet her to end the strike 
which some observers said 
has cost the TV and film 
industry $40 million a week. 

SAG spokeswoman Kim 
Feller said union leaders 
meeting this weekend could 
authorize their members to 
return to work before the 
ballots are counted. 

The latest round in the on· 
again, off-again talks settled

"But I like the way it

either. 'Tomorrow' was the 
only song that made it big

Shelton leaning back in a

Shelton has been playing 
the role of Daddy Warbucks, 
the billionaire industrialist 
who adopts Little Orphan 
Annie, for four years. He will 

rea~h the I,SOOth perfor-

when the show leaves San 
Diego's Fox Theater in 
October for Minneapolis. He 
originated the role at the 
Goodspeed Opera Company 
in Connecticut and left 
Broadway a year ago to head 
the West Coast Company of 
the show, one of the few hit 
musicials of the last decade. 

Shelton will not continue 
the role in the movie - Albert 
Finney, Shelton says, is the 
frontrunner now - but he 
cou ld continue in the show

Sculpture

by Fontana 

A "sound sculpture" by 
Bill Fontana opens in the 
Mandeville Art Gallery Sept. 
26. 

Carny-love 
sex is just 
'not enough 

Carnivals fascinate us because they 
trade openly in the vicious side of life 
- the gamble, the con, human freaks 
and perverse sex. Moviemakers from 
Fellini to Hollywood hacks have 
sought to capitalize on that fact _ Carny 
is part of that tradition. 

Set amid the sleazy allure of the 
midway with its strip shows, 
exhibitionist freaks and jeering 
barkers, Carny deals with the tensions 
of a shaky love triangle. Robbie 
Robertson plays Patch, a midway 
manager for a carnival whose job 
involves paying off local officials to 
keep the carnival open. Though his 
business is bribery, his concerns are 
those of any smalltime businessman -
to keep out of trou ble and to make a 

Patch also spends his time looking 
out for his friend Frankie (Gary 
Busey), an amiable, not-too-bright 
jester who sits in a cage and taunts 
passersby into throwing halls at a 
target WIth the object of dunking him 
in the water. Frankie is in the carnival 
for the people, not the money_ 

The two men's friendship is 
jeopardized when Frankie takes ~p 
with a just-this-side-of jail bait 
waitress named Donna Godie Foster), 
who decides to travel with the 
carnival. 

Fontana set up micro-
phones at La Jolla Shores and 
plans to broadcast the sounds 
into the gallery 24 hours a 
day.

show, which runs from today 
until Oct. 17, call 452-2864.

LJ jazz festival 
has \VeIl kno\Vns 

New jazz stars are the best 
BY TED BURKE 

Special to the Daily Guardian 

It's sad to say, but even the 
most chauvinistic among us 
have to admit that San 
Diego's reputation as a 
cultural wasteland is in large 
part deserved. Now and then, 
however, glimmers of what 
this town could grow into do 
appear, as evinced by The La 
Jolla Jazz Festival. 

When it debuted last year 
in Sherwood Hall of La Jolla 's 
Museum of Contemoorarv · 
Art, the fete was somethingof 
which local jazz fans could 
boast. Rather than bringing 
in 'name' musicians who 
could sell tickets, producer 
Rob Hagey opted instead for a 
number oft he best 'new' jazz 
musicians in the country, 
including such respected 
avant·garde grouJ>!i as Air, 
Old and New Dreams, Art 
Lande and Rubisa, Anthony 
Davis and others. 

The second annual La Jolla 
Jazz Festival, scheduled for 
Oct. 3·5 on the Old Globe 
Festival Stage in Balboa 
Park, will be markedly 
different. Where the first 
festival took place over a 
period of three successive 
weekends and featured 
challenging music, the 
second will occur over a 
single three-day stretch and 
wil have a more varied 
schedule. 

'It occurred to me that 

listening to three avant·garde 
jazz performances in a row is 
something like sitting 
through three Shake· 
spearean tragedies, " says 
Hagey. 'It can really wear you 
down . At any given 
Shakespeare fe tival, they'll 
mix up the programming 
with, say, a tragedy like 
Othello, a comooy as in Asyou 
Like It, and a history play 
like Julius Caesar. 

They maintain a high 
aesthetic level while varying 
the program. The same thing 
with last year's festival . As 

, far as I'm concerned, the . 
musicians like Don Cherry, 
Lande or Henry Threadgill 
played brilliant , 'outside: 
challenging music, but their 
kind of music requires a lot of 
attention, and three bands 
like that in a row can be too 
much, a little too demanding 
for a listener. So this year we 
decided to mix it up a bit, to 
present a wider variety of 
music," 

This year, the music will 
range through Dixieland, 
hard bop, blues, big· band and 
avant·gardisms. The Friday 
show, at 7:30 pm, will feature 
some of the best San Diego 
jazz men with both the San 
Diego All·Star Jazz Band 
(highlighting Joe Marillo, 
Holl is Gentry, Gary Pack and 
UCSD music faculty 

members Jimmy Cheatham 
and Bert Turetsky), and the 
Benny La Gasse Dixieland 
Sextet. 

The Saturday concerts will 
take on an international air, 
with the 1 pm concert 
featurinl! the hard·boo 
stylings of the Woody Shaw 
Quintet, the African·laced 
improvisations of the Randy 
Weston Trio, and the South· 
Island rhythms of the 
Trinidad Calypso Steel Band.

To Hagey, moving this 
year's concert series to the 
Old Globe Festival Stage was 
the right thing to do in order 
to en hance t he festival 
atmosphere he wanted. 

"It's outside and it's inti· 
mate, and to me it's just fine, 
a beautiful place to have a 
concert," he says. "I wantthe 
festival to be an event that 
expresses joy and beauty." 

With the expected growth 
of the La Jolla Jazz Festival in 
coming years, Hagey hopes 
that the event will become a 
firm part of the community,

"The support we'regettinll

idea. But Carny ~ wrong 
because the men s rei at ion-
hip and the source of Patch's 

jealousy are so hazily defined. 
If themen are just buddies, as 
seems to be the ca e, why 
does Patch treat Donna 0 
cruelly? Clearly, he sees her 
as more a threat than a 
nuisance. But Patch doe n't 
articulate his feelings , so it is 
not clear whether he knows 
just what the problem is or 
whether even the film's 
writers knew what it was. 

We receive only obscure 
hints; one of the carnies tell 
Donna, "Ain't nobody gets in 
the middle of those two." 
Whether it's latent homosex· 
uality or the jealousy of an 
alienated friend, by failing to 
account for this tension, the 
film diffuses most of its 
dramatic potential. Even the 
director (Robert Kaylor) 
seems to lose interest in the 
relationship of Frankie and 
Patch in the second half of 
the film and turns to several 
action subplots to liven 
things up. These subplots, 
including a scene in which 
local red necks trash the 
carnival and another in 
which Patch and Frankie 
sting two extortionists, seem 
jarringly out·of·place with 
the film's beginning. 

What's remarkable about 
Corny is that for all its poor 
characterizations and lack of 
focus, the acting is uniformly 
excellent and reason enough 
to see the film. Robertson, 
with his canny, rorrupt boy's 
face, is convincing as , the 
edgy, cynical Patch. Corny is 
not only Robertson's acting 
debut, but he produced the 
film and contributed to the 
script ~ well. Robertson's 
only . previous experience 
with film w~ as the producer 
of The Last Waltz. In that 
film, he demonstrated good 
instincts for playing to the 
camera and a studious 
concern for his ima&.e, with 
the effect of making The Last 
Waltz a film more about 
Robbie Robertson than The 
Band. Robertson's instiricts 
serve him as weU in Corny. 
He does not so much act ~ 
display a set of attitudes or 
poses, yet he is an alluring 
performer. 

Carny is currently playing 
at the Flower Hill Cinema in 
Del Mar.

Armitage and Topkis speak with 
the new Muir College Council 
:ontinued from page 1 
Jeremy Charlton, last year's 
Reg Fee Chair Liz Riley and 
this year's Reg Fee Chair 
Cathy Valerio, and asked 
them "to express their minds 
and be frank about" their 
gripes against the "old plan." 
He said he would "see what 
could be done about it." 

"You just have to believe 
me," he said, and added that 
"I didn't do anything without 
letting them (C harlton, Riley 
and Valerio) see it and put in 

, what they had to say." 
Armitage went on to explain 
the summer retreat that he 
called for three days with the 

< faculty and staff of the Reg 
Fee Committee to draft the 
new proposal. "I couldn't get 
all of the (faculty) unit heads 
together for three consecu· 
tive days until the end of 
spring quarter." 

The question was then 
asked if Armitage planned to 
hold a retreat with the 
studen t representatives from 
the four coUeges to discuss 
the new draft proposal. "It 
was never suggested," 
Armitage answered. 

He said that although he 
didn't think his move was 
" unjust," he agreed that 
there should have been 
"better com m u n i cat ion" 
between the unit heads and 
the students.

night's meeting was acting

for the spot, but made it clear 
that the position will be open 
to all students. "anybody can 
apply for the position, but I 
don't really think they'll get 
serious consideration for 
VP." 

"They have to be close to 
me. and work with me," he 
said . "The president and vice 
president have to be a team." 

Topkis also pointed out 
that he needed people to fill in 
spots as commissioner , 
"I'm looking for fresh people 
who want to get involved." A 
new set of posting rules for 
Muir were al 0 adopted at 

last night's discussion with 
the highlights being: 

- All posters must be 
stamped by MOM or the 
Resident Dean's Office. 

- Only one poster will be 
allowed on each lamp post, 
wall and pillar. 

- AU posters must be 
removed within 3 days after 
the advertised event. 

- Posting is prohibited on 
trees, door ,windows and the 
outside of the Muir Five and 
Dime. 

Failure to comply with 
these and other rules could 
cause po ting right s to be 
banned for the offending 
group. 

Gill says IBG fair 
continued from palle 1 
all of its considerations of 
the matter, the (mC) has 
been meticu·lously proper, 
extremely thorough, and 
completely unbiased in 
any judge· ments," Gill 
wrote. 

Gill also defended the 
accuracy of the mc report , 
saying, "Information 
contained in (Kennedy's 
letter) is in all respects 
identical to that presented 
to the investigating 
committee of the IBC and 
in all regards agrees 
completely with the 
chronology of events as 
described by Dr. Kennedy 
which is included in the 

IBC report to the NIH. 
"No new information is 

contained in Dr. Ken· 
nedy 's letter to Dr. Talbot 
which would alter the 
committ~'s chronology." 

The IDC w~ asked by 
the NIH to detail a 
chronology of events 
involved in the ill~al 
cloning of the semhki 
virus by Kennedy. They 
concluded t hat Kennedy 
either intentionally 
violated the law or violated 
it through carelessness_ 

Kennedy then resigned 
his Associate Professor· 
ship before responding l> 
the mc charges in his own 
Sept. 18 letter to the NIH.

In the September 23 
art. icle on UCSD's 
Counseling and Psycho-
logical Services, it was 
erroneous ly reported that 
spouses or living partners 
of enrolled students may 
receive free counseling. 
Only if they are involved in 
relationship or other 
difficulties with a 
registered student may 
non ·enrolled students 
receive counseling at no 
cost.

Topkis has 
good ideas 
continued from page 4 
a dmini tration po t , 

rmltage ' succe or will be 
cho en after a everal-month-
long nat ional earch. 

I\nd according to th 
Topki and Bekken, tudent 
Wi ll playa more active role in 
the election proce than 
they did in choo ing of a 
uccessor to Ja t year's 

chancellor, William McElroy. 
"The students - meaning 

the AS - are going to insist 
that they have a voice in the 
selection of the vice 
chancellor of student 
affairs," Topkis said. "We 
want at least 50 percent 
students on the (search) 
committee." 

The Daily Guardian 

No winner in de bate 
NEW YORK - Ameri -

can aytheycouldn 'tpi ka 
clear winner in he fi r t 
pre idential debate between 
John Ander on and Ronald 
Reagan, aying both m n 
cored poi n t in t he 

nationally televi ed confron-
tat ion , an A ociated Pre -
NBC poll say . 

President Carter' refusal 
to take part in that first 
debate ponsored by the 
League of Women Voters on 
Sunday drew strong 
disapproval from many likely 
voters. 

But Carter's refusal, the 
debate and the other events of 
the past month left the 
presidential candidates not 
much different from where 

they . tood in mid-Augu t. 
Reagan i up ju t a bit, wh ile 
Carter and Anderson are 
e entially unchanged. 

ApproXimately 1,500 likely 
vot r acro th nation were 
interviewed by telephone 
Monday through W dnesday 
for the late tAP-NBC New 
poll. 

Each was asked whom 
they would vote for if the 
presidential election were 
held today. 

Reagan was the choice of 
42 percent and Carter of 33 
percent. Anderson was 
named by 13 percent. One 
percent mentioned others 
and 11 percent said they were 
undecided. 

Armitage is 
to resign 

continued from page 4 
mu t not be like Atkin on'~ 
- we've ~ot to know what ' 
going on. he ay . 

Other long-range goal 
Topki Ii ts include the 
incorporation of the A and 
dealing with an Activity Fee 
increase. 

Though Topkis and the AS 
have set these and some 24 
other goals, he believes he 
can be effective and pick up 
the seriou aspect of the AS 
succe sfully where Jeremy 
left off. 

"It (the AS) is serious 
business, but some people 
take it beyond that," Topkis 
says. 

Friday, eptember 26, 1980 

SDSP has 
more info 
continued from page 1 
draft, hinderen e of draft 
regi [ration or coun eling 
agamst regi tration are all 
ill gal and are punishable by 
a maximum penalty of five 
years in prison and/or a 
$10,000 fine. Nobody knows, 
however, to what extent this 
law will be enforced . 

Burner point out that if 
arre ts are made for these 
violations, the pro ecution 
will have to not only prove' 
that the accused was 
supposed to register and did 
not, but also that they 
intentionally violated the 
law. "The government has a 
duty to inform you," said 
Burner. 

Much of the information 
released regarding draft 
registration was contradic-
tory or incorrect, Burner said. 
This may be used in courts if 
nece sary. 

It is difficult to say just 
how easy it will be for the 
government to locate 
offenders or how much effort 
will be put into locating 
them, he aid. 

Burner feels that registra· 
tion will lead to the 
rein tatement of the draft. 
Kathy Gilberd agree with 
this. "I think it is likely that 
they will give it a try early 
next year," he said. She 
admits thi is only specula-
tion. 

According to Gilberd, the 
draft could be rein tated as 
written in a memorandum 
from Pre ident Carter to 
Congress last winter. First , a 
state of emergency would be 
declared by Carter, then he 
would request the permission 
of Congress to start the draft. 
This permission could be 
given to Carter in as little as 
24 hours. The next day, draft 
boards would be set up in 
recruiting offices and 
induction notices would 
begin to be mailed to eligible 
young men. 

For those requesting a 
deferment , it cannot be 
applied for until the 
induction notice has been 
sent. At that time there will 
probably be 15 days to file for 
a deferment. For this reason, 
Gil berd advises anyone 
planning to seek a deferment 
to get counseling now. 

Even those resisting 
registration should look into 
this, she says, since resistors 
will probably be given a 
second chance to register. 

Many of the draft laws 
have changed drastically 
since the Vietnam war, and 
he ur~es people to beware of 

"street' advice. 
Since the student defer-

ment no longer exi tS I 
tu"dents wi hing to avoid the 

draft will need to seek other 
type of deferment. The most 
common type of deferment 
are Family Hard hip 
Deferment, Con cientiou 
Objector , and 4Fs (Medical, 
Psychological or Morally 
unfit for Service). 

More information on 
deferments can be received 
by contacting the San Diego 
Student for Peace at 452-
4450, or t he Selective ervice 
Law Panel at 233-1701. 

"It' not imply a matter of 
involuntary servitude, " 
in ists Gilberd, "It' a matter 
of being made part of the 
Carter doctrine in a very real 
and possibly deadly way."
