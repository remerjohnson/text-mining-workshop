Letter to the Editor 

Losing weight along 
wi th self-assurance 
Editor: 

I have finally become 
angered enough to write a 
let ter in response to "Let • face 
it: fat people have no reason to 
live." La t year [ lost a very 
clo e friend who succumbed to 
that same attitude that many 
people in our society forced 
upon her, and today I wonder if 
] am heading in that same 
direction. La t year "Joyce" 
worried about how people 
would accept her, but today 
she does not have to worry ' 
because she is dead. 

The title of the article alone 
bring tears to my eyes; 
intolerance to fat people is not 
the answer. Obviously the 
author of the article has never 
had to battle with obesilY If 
helshe did have a weight 
problem and was capable 
through heer determination 
of shedding off those 
"unsightly" pound~ then I feel 
they are a rare individiual. 

After "Joyce' .. death r was 
determined to achieve the goal 
that haunted her for years. In 
two months I lost 48 pounds. 
altogether I have lost 70 
pounds in six and a half 
months. Hooray for me some 
think. Well. in the process I 
have become bulimarexic . The 
author say that helshe is 
there to help me. Where are 
you when I am ret ch ing my 
guts up 50 as not to be that fat 
person socIety can do WIt hout? 

I applaud an} bUSiness that 
prod uces cloth ing for t hr 
"portly man" or the 'full 
figured woman." The farther 
one is outcast by our sOClet}, 
the harder it becomes to 
resoci al17e one back into it, and 
clothing is an important 
feature in our society. 

ArtIcles like "Fat people 
ha ve no reason" a re not 

The Bottom Line 

helpfu l to a fat person. itonly 
cau e further psychological 
trauma, If the per.on Writing 
in want to help me or others 
like me. hel he could keep 
the e "intolerant" notions to 
themself and practice more 
compassion and understan· 
ding. It is true, we do not 
always eat because we are 
hungry , so suggesting 
something as SImple a 
discipline when ingesting food 
just wi ll not apply. 

Although some people wi ll 
not believe this, I was a much 
happier person when [ was 
obe e. [ wa secure. self· 
assured and I knew who my 
friends were. Today I am 
neurotic and obsessed with my 
weight. even more than when] 
was heavy, I cannot enjoy a 
meal because I am too busy 
worrying about getting to a 
bathroom in time to throw·up 
before r am "affect~" by any 
of the calorie. ometlmes I 
wonder if "Joyce" had the 
right idea. 

As long as t here are 
attitudes like "no reason " I'll 
never be sure I'll make it. I am 
glad that t he person who wrote 
the article did not sign their 
name, beacause I am not quit~ 
sure how I would re<lc1. I hold 
attitude~ like their's 
responsible for the deat h of one 
of the sweetest. most beautiful 
people I ever kne\\ 

Before saying something to 
someone overweIght, think if

Lou Grant: from ratings wars 
to calling Moses a 'scumbag' 

Washington - In the long 
run the demise of CBS·TV's 
Lou Grant may prove good 
news for actor Ed A nero Bu t 
it's bad news for Hollywood's 
activi t community an d 
television viewer at large, 

When CBS announced last 
week that Lou Grallt, starring 
A ner in the tit le role, and the 
rest of the prime·time 
newshounds had been spiked 
from the network's fall 
schedule, we weren't all that 
surprised. For . ome time now, 
it's seemed that GrOll I 's 
extraordinarily topical L.A. 
Tribune might be headed the 
way of The Washington Star. 

Pleading an ab ence of 
malice, CBS said the 
cancellatIOn was a matter of 
numbers. Over the last three 
years it se m that increa " 
ingly fewer TV junkies have 
been tuning in the Monday 
night program. The program's 
NieL en share has declined 
from 32 percent of the 
audience to 17 percent. In the 
ratlOgs \\'ar. such precipitous 
slides generall) mean it's time 
for "the hook" 

Yet, In response the ira<;clbl 
Asner downplayed the 
popularlt y of Monday Night 
Footba II and blamed CBS for 
succumbing to conservative 
disapproval of the star's 
liberal polit ical actIvities. 
Earlier dUring the week , in 
fact. Kimberly-Clark Corp. 
(t he maker of Kleenex) had 

withdrawn its "minor" 
sponsorship of the program, 
ci t i ng A nero notorious 
support for a relief program 
whIch involves Salvadonan 
guerrillas. As Asner postured. 
CBS feared a widening boycott 
~)' right-~ying "schnooks" and 

yahoos. 
. Perhaps It was Grant's 

roving editorial eye that led 
A~ner to carry the banner of 
thc Equal Rights Amendment. 
striking PATCO members, the 
Freedom of Information Act 
and. more recently, opposition 
to US involvement in EI 
Salvador . Indeed, had 
television executive Grant 
Tinker (now with BC) and 
star Mary Tyler Moore not 
succe sfully reincarnated 
Asner, the actor' opinion 
might still be fighting 
ob<.;curity. 

• ow. even one of Asner's 
crit ics. the Re\·. Jerry Falwell . 
says his famil y "watches ... and 
appreciates" the LOll (;Yf/llt 

~rics. 
I lespttc ~uch hIghly-placed 

tan, . it did the lovable eduor 
lit tie good to call Charlton 
Ilesion. who once played 
~1(llo,es. a '\cumbag." 

;\1 0 reo \ er, as late as last 
week Asner was taking full 
ad\ antage of the fuzzy 
di<.;tlnction between himself 
and hIS favorite charracter. A 
recent fundr;wiing let ter on 
Ix'half of Medical Aid to EI 
Salvador. for example, opened 

with: "My name I Ed Asner. I 
play 'Lou Grant' on tele· 
vision," uch , elf·indu Igence 
ha<; led evcn t he usually trendy 
Nell' York magazine to ask 
f1atlv , "What does Lou Grant 
knmv about El Salvador?" 
A·mer, it seem , has 10 t the 
credibi lity that such lower-key 
televi ion activi ts as Alan 
AIda and Carol Burnett cling 
to. 

Unfortunately , whether real 
or not. the mere appearance of 
net work jitters over spon or 
blacklist ing may encourage 
up·and-coming actors and 
act res . e to limit their 
involvement in the public 
arena. 

"Ed't; partIcularly afraId 
that the next time a network 
gets a proposal for a topical 
show, it will look at Lou Grant 
and say 'no,' " said Bill 
Zimmerman, the Los Angele . 
based media consultant who 
had engineered Asner 's 
involvement WIth Medical Aid 
to El Salvador. "It hurh us all 
pol! t icall y,' 

Indeed . no one benefits 
whrn a pt'rson is penalin'(l for 
his or her pohtical VIt:WS. Such 
Institutions as KImberly· 
Clark. whose politICal action 
commIttee primarily suppor-
ted the conservat ive likes of 
Sens. Jeremiah Denton Jr. (R-
Ala. ) and Barry M, Goldwater 
(R-Ariz. ), successfully promote 
controversial posit ions with 
impunity.

Letter to the Editor 

Conveying a message of taste to the Revelle caf 
Editor: 

I am rather impres ed wi th 
the new appearance of t he 
Revelle Cafeteria. It seems as 
though the cafeteria admin is· 
t rat ion is t rying extra hard to 
d iscou r age s tud en ts from 
enjoying the time they spend 
in that place of alimentary 
intrigue. 

First. It was the new 
conveyor belt for the dish 
room. T he old conveyor belt, 

Eye to eye 
continued from page 2 

Without a doubt the hardest 
people for me to glance at are 
beautiful women, Whatever 
games I was playi ng before 
with glances and nods doesn't 
even figure in now, becau e 
beautiful women can put a 
look on me that can make me 
shri\'el up like t he wicked 
witch of the ort h. LIke 110 
contest. not a glare they gi\'e 
but an ICY st are. and my. how 
Iho"e eves burn. Smiles are 
much -too rare and far 
between, but certainly well 
worth weathering the Ice.

little game, but it tells a lot 
about people wit h a lot more to 
hldr. 

with its seldom-u ed south 
fee de r , was torn out 
completely. leaving a hole in 
the wall and an empty place, 
somew hat disorienting when 
fi rst seen . Then a new and 
complex conveyor belt was 
insta lled, with a new hole 
knocked in the wall to 
accomodate it. Thi new belt 
fed (rom the north side only, 
dest roying the architectural 
symmetry of the cafeteria, To 
cap these accomplishments, 
the old belt 's hole in the wall 
was covered with a random 
checker-patter n ed ti l e, 
pecifically chosen to clash 

with t he solid grey tile 
covering the rest of the wall. 

When questioned, one of the 
supervisory cafeteria employ· 
ees told me that the reason for 
the new conveyer belt was that 
the dishroom system needed 
modernizing. I ha\C not 
learned exactly how much the 
new belt cost, but it is eert ain 
that the Caf AdmlOlst rat ion 
spent thousands of dollars on 
It. I am abo Ignorant of 
whether the new helt and all 
was r (Illy needed I am 
worried, though. that 
conSIderably ch aper repairs 
to t he old belt might ha\'edone. 

After the new belt was in 
and workmg. I had occa"lon to 
remark to mv dInner 
companions ahout the tnlh of 
putting checkered tde In with 
the solid·color. We agreed that 
it seemed to be an example of 
either the profound lack of 

taste, or the simple incom· 
petence of whoever wa. in 
charge. 

Perhaps someone else 
" oticed the incongruity . At 
any rate, the next thing they 
did was tart paillli~lg the tile 
walls! Though this did cover 
up tlie checkers, I think it was 
a monumentally stupid move. 
It was entIrely unnecessary . 
as t he tile walls (except for 
that new patch) were perfectly 
attractive and well·main · 
tained, and prettier than the 
streaki ly applied paint 
anyway. And when the paint 
had dried, the patch appeared 
in a different color, 

The paint is bad from both a 
practical and an aesthetic 
point of view. The tile was 
nonporous and washable , thus 
easy to clean. The paint will 
collect dirt and keep it. As the 
pamt ages and begms to flake 
and ChIP, It will be nece 'sary to 
scrape the walls and repaint. 
The paint \\JlI never be as 

attractive as th tile, because 
It will get dirty and its surface 
will lose its gloss as it ages. If 
this weren't enough, It is 
costing us hundreds of dollars 
to complete this Idiotic and 
unnecessary paint job, and 
will cost us more in the future 
as this layer of patnt expIres, 

With hou~lng cosh 
sche duled for anot her

IS both nasty and callou of the 
Housing and Food Service

whether religion forms a separate conceptual

standing -- and in particular whether efforts to 
understand or interpret religion by any form of

6 The UCSD GUilrdian T hursday, May 20, 1982 

Students gather to protest aid cuts, etc. 
By HANK SCHULMAN 

Sat'ramento Correspondent 
Nearly 300 California 

co llege and university 
tudent cut class one day la t 

week to travel to Sacramento, 
where they rallied against 
propo 'ed educational budget 
cuts, reduction in financial 
aid and fee hikes. 

The placard -ca.r rying 
demon st rators , mo st l y 
minority students from the 
Bay Area. marched along 
Capitol Mall toward the State 
Capitol, where their boister· 
ous rall~' began 45 minute. 
later. About 30 University of 

California students from 
north state campu es also 
attended, doing some personal 
lobbying before the rally . 

Although the rally wa 
billed to highlight the proposed 
cuts all around, most of the 

peakers called for greater 
educational and societal right 
for Third World tudents. 
much to the plea ure of the 
attentive crowd. 

"There was a time when we 
thought it wa cool to reject 
the educat ional system," aid 
Jo e Montoya of the Royal 
Chicano Air Force. "But we 
found being cool got us on 

dope, into welfare or in the 
army." 

San Franci sco tate 
University (SFSu) activist 
Derek William , who contin-
ually decried the "rich , white" 
system, told ralliers "We are 
not the abnormal ones for 
being politically inclined. 
Those who are not polit ically 
inclined are abnormal. Don' t 
let anyone tell you you are too 
political. That 's bullshit. " 

Some attention wa paid to 
issues pre ently before the 
State Legislature . FSU 
student Karen Umemot, the 
rally's master of ceremonies, 

related five demands from 
tudents: 1) no fee increases; 2) 

no tui tion; 3) no cuts in faculty 
and taff; 4) an enrollment 
increase and program 
development for Third World 
students; 5) no cuts in state 
financial aid. 

Demonstrators cheered 
wildly at each speaker, 
turning the normally-placed 
west s teps of the Capitol into a 
]960s rally arena. 

(to pay for school)," the ultra-
conservative lawmaker told a 
reporter. "In my day there 
were no government programs 
in high school except for 
ROTC . The rest of us worked . 
I was a parking attendant. 

"Any government big 
enough to give you everything 
you want is big enough to take 
away everything you've got ," 
he concluded. A crowd formed 
to debate Schmitz, but state 
police broke it up. 

Before the rally , which 
la ted well over two hours. 
about 30 UC students broke 
into groups to lobby with 
individual lawmakers against 
the education cuts. The 

Students will starve for one 
night to benefit the hungry 

Perhaps the most emotional 
moment came when American 
Indian leader Denni Banks 
denou need plans by t he federal 
government to close American 
Indian chools around the 
country, including DQ 
University near Davi, the 
school he head s. 

Assemblymember Tom 
Bate; (D-Oakland) was the 
only legis lator scheduled to 
appear at the demonstration . 

Although the busloads of 
ralliers loudly applauded the 
speakers, one passerby. Sen. 
John Schmitz (R-Corona Del 
Mar) reacted against the 
students. 

tudents. however. encoun-
tered mostly admini trative 
assistants Instead of busy 
lawmakers. 

"I thought J'dget achanceto 
get the proverbial runaround, 
and I'm getting it," UC 
Berkeley student Kri sti n 
Pr 'entice laughed while 
waiting for Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown , who never 
materialized.

A 'freeze' in works 
for state budget DOOIISBUBI 
continued from page 5 
dollar amount it allocated la t 
year, the inflationary effect 
would be a $47 million loss of 
'pending power. 

While UC officials admit 
thi ' reduction would be 
undesirable, it i far better 
than the $100 million or more 
which legislators had asked 
their staff members to review. 

University officials say they 
also may be able to convince 
lawmaker: that last October's 
mid-year budget cuts unfairly 
burdened the UC 5y tern , 
which took 28 percent of the 
reduction while compri ' ing 
only four percent of the 
budget. If legi lators agree, 
t hey might be more generous 
with the system this year. 

While t he budget subcom-
mittees were hesi tant to 
require any fee increases of UC 
tudent, orne may still be 

incl uded in the final budget 
proposal which the mall 
leadership group will iron ou t, 
presumably before the June 15 
approval deadline, which the 
Legislature has met only once 
in the pas t 10 years. 

Unti l then, students and 

univer it y offi ia ls wi ll have 
to wait to discover what price 
the UC system will have to pay 
for the stat e's eco nomi c 
difficulties.

" How can one pe rso n

minutes with Brown's deputy

Red\Vood cloning tnay change titnber industry 
Sixty million years ago, 

coastal redwoods were 
common throughout the 
Northern Hemi phere. Today, 
they are confined to a 500·mile 
stretch along the Pacific coast, 
from Monterey, California to 
the southwestern tip of 
Oregon. 

Although changes in climate 
are largely responsitle for the 
redwood' diminL hed range, 
inten ive logging for the past 
century ha contributed to its 
steady di appearance. Of the 
remaining two million acres, 
only 60,000 are virgin timber. 
And consen'ationist , say 
nearlv half·a ·million acre~ 
co uld su tain new or 
additional redwood growth . 

grew to be extremely 
interesl ing, and being an eager 
young grad student. like 
everyone el e, I was always 
looking for something 
interest ing." 

But the ti sue culture 
technique that Ball and his 
associate, Patricia Ponzini , 
use today are more than just 
academically intere ting; they 
offer many advantages for 
propagating redwoods . For 
example, the two -cientists 
can select and reproduce what 
they think are genetically 
s uperior trees , thereby 
eliminating the chance of a 
cross with inferior ~tock. 

a bad genetic makeup rendered 
them sterile. 

The latter is more probable, 
Ball says, becau e of the 
redwood s' great genet ic 
variability. They have 66 
chromosome, almost three 
time as many a mo. t other 
conifers. This means that 
redwoods can possibly have 
nine·billion variations. 

Ball' ti ss ue culture 
technique has three main 
sleps: maintaining a piece of 
ti sue in culture; including the 
cells to dedifferentiate; and 
then Inducing them to 
res peciali7e. 

One batch of cloned 
plantlets has been ,>ucccssful · 
ly cultivated in a test plot for 

the las t five years by the 
impson Timber company, a 

supporter of Ball' s research . 
So far, the tis ue culture 
plantlets arc growing twice as 
fast a s conventionally 
produced seedlings, 

But only time will tell the 
value of tis s ue culture 
techniques. If all goes well, the 
redwoods from Ball' s 
laboratory, if they are to be 
logged , will be ready for 
harvesti ng in another hundred 
year . Or, if preserved, they 
will have just begu n their 800· 
or even 2000'year existence. 

The coastal redwood, or 
eQuoia sell/peY/'ir/' lIs, is prized 

for its beauty and its lumber . 
Unlike its lar'ger relatlvr111 the 

high Sierras, the equ()/{/ 
{(iglm/eas, the coastal redwood 
resists insects, decay and fire, 
and its wood product s are 
straight·grained, shrinkproof 
and durable. 

A great testimony to its fire 
resistance came in 1906 after 
the San Francisco earthquake 
and fire left man y redwood 
str uctures vi rtually un · 
touched . 

Because the redwood' s 
I runk lapers only slightly as it 
reaches its full height of 350 
feet, its lumber is gigantic. 
One acre of average redwood .. 
Yields about 70,000 board feet 
of lumber , enough to build fi ve 
small house. 

For the pas t 30 years, 
Professor of Biology Ernest 
Ball of UC anta Cru:t ha;; 
been working on ways that 
may well revolutionize both 
reforestation and the timber 
Indu try . Ball is cloning 
redwood s, or producing 
genetically identical "plant· 
let " from a mgle piece of 
redwood ti ue. 

They have discovered that 
tIssue fromled\\oods growing 
at hIgher alt itudes ll1 drier soil 
produces healthier plantlets 
than I issue from redwood:, 
growing al lower alti tudes. 
Ball SUSIX!cts that Ihe high· 
alllt ude trres represent 
supenor stocks that never get 
'h e c h a n ce to assert 
themselve" because of poor 
envi ronmental conditions. 

The eruption of Mount St. Helens 

"Cloning is not as startltng a 
concept in the plant world as it 
is in the animal world," ~avs 
Ball. PropagatIng African 
violets or geraniums bv 
root l'lg their leave tn pottmg 
sotl is one type of dOl11ng. 
Cloning tree" IS more difficult. 
but not all that uncommon. 

Ball was more interested m 
the redwood's academic value 
than tts commercial value 
when he began workll1g to 
clone redwood tl:,sue Il1 the 
1950s. While at the Unl\,ersit\, 
of North Carolina, the plan'l 
"Clenti·t \,\ as the first to 
culture a gymnosperm, the 
cla. s of tree" to whIch the 
redwood belongs.

urvey , were in charge of 
"hazard assessment" for the 
governor. Stnce April, 1980, 
they had monitored the 
growing bulge on the 
mountain's north s ide . 
InterVIewed for t he program, 
the scientists ~ay they were 
unaware the area near the 
bulge remained op n to the 
public. Both say that zone· 
making is a public Jloliq area 
which nghlfully belongslOthe 
state. 

On la~ IR, 1980 tht bu lge 
blew away. It appear" that the 
'iclentlsts' noninvol\'ement 
coupled with the governor's 
zoning plan may have had 
fatal consequences for 57 
people. Had the volcano blown 
the next day (Monda y), 
however, over 1,000 loggers 
would have dled . 

Experts pomt out that the 
Mt. St. Helens experience is 

t~ pica I and that changes must 

be made in attit ude ana 
communica t ion in planning 
for future dlsa~ters. As Olto 

ieber puts it : "If wedan'l look 
at how t his one was handled or 
mishandled, and we just sit 
back and say we did a hell of a 
good job when 57 people died 
needlessly, then next time, 
mavbe, we will not be so 
lucky."

Concert 
opens La 
Casa Cafe 

By LEIGH GILKEY 
Last week's opening of the 

La Casa Cafe, previously 
known as the Third College 
Snackbar , waf; highlighted by 
the appearance of Seriou 
Consequences , a trio of 
st udent mu sicians from 
UCSD. The show consisted of 
70 minutes of polished vocals, 
deft musicianship and playful 
tage banter all combined into 

a harmonious and entertain· 
ing blend. 

The en emble's wide range 
of selections and t he fact that 
the instrumental backing 
consists olev of two acou tic 
guitar combine to produce 
one of the most unique student 
bands on campus. Although 
the instrumentation seemed 
bare at times, the strength of 
the three part harmonies 
worked well to overcome this , 
filling even the most remote 
corners of the room with 
sound . 

From their opening number, 
an energetic version of the 
Beatie ' "Please Please Me," 

erious Con equence 
established a rapport with 
their audience that would hold 
for the remainder of the 
evening. John Macintryre 's 
feats of vocal dexterity on "39" 
brought ohhs and ahhs from 
the crowd while Mike Lock' s 
and Dave Burn's rendition of 
"Dueling Banjos" elicited a 
response more along the lines 
of foot·stomp1l1g and knee· 
. lapping. 

Later , a hush fell over the 
room as the three performed 
an a capella ver ion of Stephen 
Fo ter's "Hard Times." The 
ent ire show was punct urated 
by little bits of whimsical 
exchange amongst the 
performers, and between them

'An American Werewolf in London ' scrcen. here aturday. 

'Werewolf'will be 
shown here Sat. 

The latest cult classic on 
college campuses across the 
country is the new 10hn Landis 
film All A meriCOII Werewolf in 
London . He is bet ter known for 
his work on Animal Holtsea nd 
Blues Brothers. It is a zany 
spoof of the old werewolf films 
with a mixtureof rock and roll, 
co medy, a nd s urrea li stic 
horror. 

Da\'id aughton, known for 
his dancing and singing in the 
Dr. Pepper commercials, and 
Griffin Dunne portray two 
yo ung American studen ts 
travling around Europe who 
are attacked by a werewolf 
while t hey are touring the 
moors of Northern England. 
This begins the nightmare for 
David. who becomes a 
werewolf, and Griffin becomes 
one of the "undead" trying to 
convince David to take his life 

in order to free the Victims 
from t he werewolf curse. 

Underscoring the entire film 
IS ome good old fashioned 
rock and roll, most of which 
has the word "moon" in the 
title or the lyrics The most 
memorable is "Bad Moon 
Rising." by Creedence 
Clearwater Re\'ival. The 
IntroductIOn of certam songs 
III some scenes 111 t he mont.' 
lend a comic quality to the 
film, for whIch LandiS ha" 
become famous. 

Add mg to all t hiS are the 
sjX'Ctacular special effects and 
the make·up by RIck Baker et 
al. The make·up effects done m 
the tran ·formation of Da\ld 

aughton into a werewolf are 
truly amazi ng, enough <;0 that 
he won an Academy Award 
th is year for it.

Softball game offers few thrills Tennis places third 
By ElAINE WALlACE 

You might wonder how we 
choose which intramu ra l 
teams to cover. 

Randomly. 
Being pressed for time, 

however. I chose the easiest 
possible method. I decided to 
cover the game I was playing 
in last Tuesday. 

But since objectivity i one 
of the key virtues of a reporter 
(you can include sportswriters 
too), j won't identify myself 
with either team. It's another 
virtue of a reporter to appear 
omniscient. Ju t forget I was 
there at aiL 

Butts to You versus Black 
Head Minus Four. An 
Immortal match-up in the 
women's softball league. 

How they got their names is 
a story in itself. The Black 
Heads Mi nus Four, of course, 
have four players without 
black hair. Of cour e. But how 
do you explain Butts to You? 

1M names 
continued from page 15 
and change hobbies respective-
ly . Soaring Cocks (2·2) and By 
By Birdie (3· L) have been out· 
smarted by Birdie Brains (4·0). 

What do these names tell u ? 
For one, if you are in a major 
sport your team will probably 
do better if it doesn't have a 
name with a exual connota· 
tion. Second. intramu ra l 
teams names show t he artistic 
ab ility of their inventor. 

"Bobby 
Bradford 
Quartet" 
featuring: 

"She's just hung up on 
butts." explained Pau li ne 
Albee of her team captain 
Tracy Dressner. Apparent ly 
he played on a couple of 

"butt " hockey teams in the 
past. May be, as Al bee 
uggested. it's jus t a fettish . 
T he tea ms were we ll · 

ma tched - neit her had 
auspicious records. 

Butts to You pulled out to an 
early lead and strengthened 
their pO ' ition by adding 
another run almost each 
inning. Key hits combined 
V.'lth a few Black Heads errors 
produced the runs. 

Defense was fine too. Debbie 
Prescott, the Butts' shortstop, 
made several fi ne plays. Her 
coun terpar t on the Black 
Head , Kyoko Sakamura. was 
just as tough . She was pretty 
tough wit h the umpire too. 
Out of play boundaries wi ll 
never be the same. 

Unfor tunately. the Black 
Heads could neither capitalize 
on hits or the opposition's 
errors . Their scoring threat in 
the ixth produced three runs 
but couldn't make a difference 
In the game. 

Final- 8·5 for Butts to You 
The end of the game and of the 
season. 

By MARK BRUESEHOFF 
Despite the tough group of 

competitors and a poor early 
performance, the UCSD men's 
tennis team finished third in 
the national competition held 
In Ka lamazoo. Michigan . 
Coach Peter Davis calls the 
finish "very extraordinary, 
considering the circum· 
stance ." 

The UCSD entry consisted 
of Eugene Jones. Dave Snider, 
Everett Gee and Pete Wood. 
Jone and Gee paired up to 
represent the number one 
seeded doubles team. 

All four competed in smgle" 
pla\, but only Sider advanced 
beyond the second round. I 
\\ asn't until round 16 that 
'Ider lost In a t ie·breaker, 6·1. 

Gee pro\ed to be a disapPOint· 
ment. They fell In the second 
round to Kalamazoo. by a score 
of 5-7, 7·5. 6-3. 

It was the effort of Ider and 
Wood which salvaged a third 
place shOWing. Davis feels that 
they "played as well ac; the 
number one team." By plaYing 
solid doubles, they advanced 
through four matches 10 reach 
the finals. It was In the finals 
I hat they finall y succum bed to 
the power of Miller and Shanse 
of Gustavus·Adoit hus. 6·2. 6-4 

At the conclUSIOn of the 
tournament, \\Tood and Ider 
were named "Doubles All · 
Americans ." 

Women's Softball Final Batting Sta tistics 3·6.6-7.5·7. Davis was pleased 
With Sider and called hl'- tie 
breaker match "one of the be~t 
in smgles competition." 

The fmai standmg had 
Gusta\'u~·Adolthus in first 
place. followed by Kalamazoo 
and ('CSD.
