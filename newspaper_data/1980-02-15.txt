Guest Lecturers to Focus 
On Themes of Marcuse 

Series Accessible to General Public 
By Katherine Hafner 

Staff Writer 
A symposium on the thought of Herbert 

Marcuse, hosted by the philosophy 
department, wiU be held here March 14 and 15. 

Planned as a series of guest lectures, 
commentary and discussion, the symposium 
will focus on major emphases in the late 
philosopher's work. 

Jurgen Habermas from the Max Planck 
Institute in Starnberg, West Germany, Martin 
Jay, a professor of history a t UC Berkeley, and 
Richard Bern tein, a philosophy professor at 
Haverford College in Pennsylvania, have 
accept~d invitations to speak at the 
symposIUm. 

Both Jay's talk on " Anamnestic 
Totalization: The Function of Memory in 
Herbert Marc'use's Thought," and Bernstein's 
"Negativity: Theme and Variation" discuss 
Marcuse's concerns in nearl}'.a11 of his writing, 
said Assistant Professor of Philosophy Robert 
Pippin, one of the principal organizers of the 
s)'1!lposium. 

Particularly in Eroa and Civilization (1955), considered by many to be his most 
important work, Marcuse stressed the concept 

that one should remember the past and use it to 
develop philosophy. 

Marcuse, who was at UCSD for nearly 15 
years, died last July in Starnberg while on a 
European lecture tour. During the late 60s, 
Marcuse became· internationally known as 
"The Father of the New Left," to which he often 
responded that he could hardly "have birthed 
so many children." 

Marcuse's last UCSD lecture on "Negative 
Dialectics" was a tribute to the late critical 
theorist Theodor Adorno. 

Unlike the Adorno lecture, Pippin pointed 
out, which was addressed to a small 
philosophical community, the symposium 
should be accessible to the general public. 

" It is meant particularly for those who have 
studied Marcuse's work, but also anyone who 
would like to learn more," Pippin said. 

Funding for the symposium is coming from 
the university . through the philosophy 
department. Posters are being sent this week to 

v~ious universities throughout the country. 
"The philosophy department is very pleased 

that we're able to do it and we hope everyone 
interested wiD attend," Pippin said.

Muir Considers Rewarding Top 
GE Teachers With Qtr Leave. 

By Toby Raymond 
Staff Writer 

A proposal formulated by the Muir 
Curriculum Review and Development Board 
to give a paid one-quarter leave to 
outstanding teachers of general education 
classes is being studied by both the AS and 
the Third College Council. 

According to MCRDB member Jim Lin, 
the purpose of the proposed reward is to 
improve the quality of the general education 
courses in hopes of boosting the traditionally 
low retention rate. 

In addition, the leave allows junior 
professors, who must concentrate on general 
~ucation clas es, the chance to research 
pr~cts in hopes of gaining tenure, said Lin. 

The cost of the project could be as high as 
one Full-Time Equivalency (FTE), 

according to Muir Asst. Dean Judith Green. 
An FTE is the average salary for one 
professor for one academic year, 
approximately $20,000. 

The actual cost could be lower if the 
interim replacement is a community college 
teacher. 

Green hopes funding for the project will 
come from the Chancellor's Advisory 
Committee on Instructional Improvement 
Programs, alumni and community donors. 

The c~rrent proposal call for the 
"outstanding" faculty to be chosen by a 
committee composed of one-half 
undergraduates, one-fourth graduate 
students and one-fourth faculty. 

The committee, approximately 30 
members, will review CAPE evaluations and

Intercollegiate Sports 
Travel Funds Capped 

By Tim Liotta 
Sports Editor 

The Registration Fee 
Committee voted earlier this 
week to tighten the belt of the 
1980 intercollegiate budget, 
recommending less than half 
of the travel expense increases 
that department was seeking. 

The committee is currently 
reviewing the budgets of 
campus student affairs 

. organizations, and will make 
its final recommendation for 
the 1980-8 1 budget to 
Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Richard Armitage this 
spring. 

Representatives from the 
intercollegiate sports program 
claimed that the proposed 
increases denied by the 
committee were necessary for 
the department to maintain a 
steady state. 

UCSD Athletic Director 
Judy Sweet said of the cut 
yesterday, "It could mean 
cutting out teams or cutting 
down teams' activities." 

Though these are possibili-
tiel, Sweet went on to say the 
department "hasn't decided' 

what it will do yet." 
The UCSD intercoUegiate 

athletics department, which 
boasts the highest fraction of 
student participation (12.5 
percent) in the UC system, 
hasn't fared well in the past in 
students' Priorities. 

The intercollegiate 
department proposed two 
increases necessary to 
maintain the program at its 
present operating level. The 
first called for an additional 
$4,100 fot salaries of part· 
time coaches. 

Also proposed was an 
increase from $3,100 to 
$5,000 to recover inflated 
travel expenses for UCSD 
teams competing in All-Cal 
tourneys. The Reg Fee 
committee voted to limit the 
allocation to $1,500, despite 
the Diad report, which 
recommended granting the 
entire $8,100. 

"The cut will severely 
restrict our ability to 
participate in the All-Cal

Dear G.R.F.: Your wife's problem is one which many of us, 
indudng lJlysdf, have faced with no small degree of concern 
and trepidation. When it was diadosed that I was .suffering from 
a serious malignancy, I received several gracIous offers of 
liemporary political asylum from foreign nations. each boasting 
of dinica offering different methods of treatment. Although I 
myself opted for chemot~r~p~ and radiation trea~e,:,~ in the

would saturate me with about 6,000 roentgens of lethal

Iodine isotopes. I also considered an offer from a clinic in Tehran 
which uses surgical excision of tumors by numerous and 
repeated firings of large·caliber firearms into the malig!,ant

dispatched to investigate the validity of this assertion has not 

, returned for over a year now, so I cannot personally vouch for 
this. And at an expense of $250K per treatment, you can

ijostage Negotiations 
Far F rom Finished 

WASHINGTON - The Carter administration on Thursday 
dismissed reports that American hostages in Iran could be 
released by the weekend and called on Iranian authorities to 
clarify their demands. 

"We are going tp have to see some more definition" of what 
the Iranians want in exchange for freeing the hostages, said 
Hodding Carter, the State Department spokesman. 

Reports circulated Wednesday in Washington that US and 
Iranian negotiators had reached a tentative agreement that 
could lead to freedom for the approximately 50 Americans who 
have been held hostage since the US Embassy in Tehran was 
seized Nov. 4. 

But a senior State Department official told reporters Thursday 
that "your would die several times over if you held your breath" 
for the hostages' imminent release. 

These remarks were not meant to reverse President Carter's 
announcement Wednesday night of "positive signs" in the 
negotiations to end the crisis. 

But they suggested the bargaining between the United States 
and Iran is still intensive. 

"Everybody is considerably ahead of the process," said Jody 
Powdl, the White House press secretary, after a meeting with 
President Carter. 

He said the news media "are running a little rapidly" in their 
optimistic forecasts of a breakthrough in the 1 03·day stalemate. 

The reports were based on an interview Iranian President 
Abolhassan Bani·Sadr had with Iralian RAI television in 
Tehran. 

In the interview. Bani·Sadr indicated that Iranian 
revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had 
accepted a plan thai could lead to freeing of the hostages. Part of 
the plan includes establishment of an international commission, 
under U N auspices, to investigate Iranian complaints against 
the United States. 

At his new~ conference Wednesday, President Carter 
indicated wiUingness for the first time to accept such a 
commillion. 

Bani-Sadr also repeale(l his demand that the United States 
acknowledge/ast "crimes" in Iran during the reign of the shah. 
"Whether an when the American hostages would be released 
depends on the US attitude," Bani·Sadr said. . 

But President Carter ruled out acceptin" blame for the U S 
role in restoring the s~ to the throne in Iran in 1953.

Calif. Prisons 
Seen Vulnerable 

SACRAMENTO - A 
California task force that 
investigated the New Mexico 
prison riot says there are 
" disturbing parallels" in 
California's prisons. 

The task force, which made 
its preliminary report 
Wednesday, was sponsored 
by the California State 
Employees' Association, the 
largest organization of state 
employees. It consisted of two 
guard$ on leave and three 
CSEA members. 

It recommended that plastic 
handcuffs no longer be used in 
California because 20 to 30 
New Mexico prisoners who 
had been taken into custody 
simply burned them wilh . 
cigarettes or musded them 
apart. 

The task force said future 
California prisons should be of 
single·cell design, not 
dormitory construction 
because prisoners are harder 
to control in the latter, and are 
more open to assault, 
intimidation and harrassment 
by other prisoners . 

Future prison design should 
also keep hospital and 
pharmacy buildin"s .eparate 
from housing and 'in range of 
gun towers to keep inmates 
from getting weapons and 
drugs, such as those used in 

New Mexico," it said. 
The mixing of minimum 

security offenders with 
hardened criminals was a 
major cause of the New 
Mexico riot, it said, and must 
not be allowed in California .

Napalm Use Alleged in Afghanistan 
KABUL, Af.haniltan (AP)-Soviet tanks and at 
leut one MiG·23 fighter bomber battled what was 
believed to be a rebellious Afghan army unit thil 
week near Kabul, witnesses reported. They said they 
believed the MiG dropped napalm bombs and that an 
undetermined number of personl were injured. 

In the northeast, a Soviet armored column suffered 
severe caaualtiel when it came under heavy attack 
this week by anti·communist Afghan rebell, reliable 
diplomatic reports laid. The Soviets, who have been 
in Afghaniltan since late December and presently 
have an estimated 90,000 troops there, were trying 
torelieve a rebel·surrounded Afghan army garilOn, 
the}'. laid. 

11Iere wu no official comment on either report. 
Meanwhile, the ltatus of Soviet·backed President 

Babralc Karmal, who has not been seen in public for 
more than a week, remained obscure. 

Witneues in Afghanistan said the Sovietl fought a 

sharp hourlong battle Monday in the village of 
Cargha, 12 miles north of Kabul. 

Western diplomats in the vicinity saw Soviet 
infantry and tanks going into action against an army 
barrack in the village of the Soviet-trained Afghan 
army. 

The MiG was seen dropping a cluster of small 
bombs, followed by a cloud of black smoke rising 
from the ground . The witnesses said they believed the 
bombs were incendiary devices made of napalm, 
chemicals added to gasoline or oil to form a jellytike 
substance used in bombs. 

Ambulances were seen removing an unknown 
number of casualities, some to the military hospital in 
Kabul. Afghan police prevented the diplomats 
approaching close enough to the barracks to get a 
clear view. All resistance apparently was crushed 
within an hour. There have been widespread reports 
of Red Army troops going into action against Afghan 

mutineers. 
The diplomatic reports said the Soviet armored 

column came under heavy rebel attack early this 
week in the northeastern province of Badakshan 
while approaching the rebel-surrounded Afghan 
army garrison in the provincial capital, Fayzabad. 

The reports said the Soviets suffered severe 
casualities when they were attacked after crossing 
the Pamir River marking the border near the town of 
Harog in Soviet Turkmenistan. 

Sporadic operations by anti·Communist rebels in 
the mountainous countryside are believed to have 
cost the Red Army several hundred dead thus far . 

But the Soviets, with some 90,000 men in the 
country supported by a huge array of tanks, artillery, 
fighter planes and helicopter gunships, appeared 
firmly in control of the largest cities and ' main 
communications routes.

workout for his starters, went 
to the bench early in the first

Four players were in double

When you think of the 
breeding grounds for quality 
volleyball players, you 
probably think of the beaches 
of Malibu or Santa Barbara. 
But Alaska? How is it that the 
UCSD's men's volleyball team 
landed a player born and 
raised on the icy beaches of 
Anchorage? 

small number of intercollegiate 
teams and low caliber of 
competition was ample reason 
for him to head south to sunny 
California. 

Last year Jim played briefly 
for Santa Barbara City 
College, but because he was 
unhappy with the coaching, he 
continued south to La Jolla. 

In his first year here, the 24-
year·old Dooley has not only 
earned his way onto the 
starting team, but he has also 
become a fixture along with 
Bob Rhodes in the Triton's 
strong middle· blocker 
position. 

When that player is Jim 
Dooley, a :;ix.foot, four-inch 
senior who hils hard, blocks 
well and adds much needed 
muscle to the Triton line-up the 
answer is easy.

WOOlen .Hope to Buil~ Win 
Into MOOlentunt · in Tennis 

By Tim LioUa _ 
Sports Editor 

The women's tennis team will seek a second 
consecutive victory at home when they host 
Westmont College on the Muir Tennis Courts 
at 2 pm. The Tritons record stands at ] .2. 

The Tritons, who opened their season with a 
pair of tough 4·5 losses, at the hands of 
Occidental College and the University of 
Redlands, bounced back last Saturday to 
trounce Whittier, capturing eight of the nine 
matches, and not losing a single sel. 

This is the Tritons' first year in a league. 
They are looking toward competing in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Conference 
Division III , which, would pit them aginst other 
non·scholarship schools. 

"We're much stronger than last year," said 
coach Liz Dudash. " We've been working on 
condition and we're much more organized than 
last year." 

Cecilia Kavanaugh, the squad's number one 
player, will be looking for her fourth 
consecutive success. She has won 36 games 

, while o® losing seven in her three previous 
outing. The only time she's suffered a defeat 
was in the doubles match against Occidental 
College, when she and her partner Genny 
Manset lost a 0 .6, 6·3, 3·6 decision. 

Robin Davis has been moved into the team' 
number two spot and has yet to lose while 
playing there. She came out on top of a tough 6· 
4, 7.5, match against Cindy Pearce of Whittier. 

Genny Manset, who started the season in the 
second spot, has been competing in the number 
three slot in hopes of bring her singles game 
around. She has yet to win on the singles court 
as she was the lone loser against Whittier 
dropping a 6-4, 6·3. Manset makes up half of 
the Tritons' number one doubles team. 

The rest of the Triton squad, Coline Shugart , 
Laura Smilh and Elizabeth Saar, all won 
convincingly last Saturday agai,nst Whittier. 

The Tritons were 6· 7 lasl season but with 
performances like the one against Whittier, the 
Tritons should improve on that record . The 
Tritons will also host -Pomona College this 
Saturday at lOam, 

1M Referee Has Unenviable 
Job of Supervising a War 

By Tim Liotta 
and 

Scott Allison 
There must be a better job. 
There has to be. 
Despite the wide variety of 

campus jobs at UCSD there is 
one employment line which 
attracts martyrs, masochists 
and those who just don't know 
any better. The line never 
comes up short. 

The job? Intramural 
Referee. 

Although that is his oHiciai 
title, students have labeled this 
poor soul. with a series of less 
fashionable names, mostly 
unprintable. 

The j{>b itself sounds 
innocent enough. But beneath 
this description lies a student 
body waiting for the first 
inadvertent whistle. They wait 
patiently, like a lion waiting to 
pounce on its unsuspecting 
prey. Intramurals is their only 
recreational outlet. Each 
contest is a war, with most of 
the heavy artillery aimed at the 
poor man in the zebra shirt. 

The actual working 
conditions of the 1M referee 

I 

turns out to be the best part of 
the job. UnFortunately he is 
unable to leave his job at the 
1M department. He is forced to 

it with him wherever he

goes. Students have branded 
him "Referee." 

He is forced to live a lonely 
life, out of a suitcase. He once 
lived on campus but was 
booted out of his room after 
calling a walking violation on 
his roommate. 

Forced to live life out of a 
suitcase, the referee is forever 
checking over his shoulder 
while on a constant run. He's 
unable to get a parking permit 
here because his car was 
blown up last year in the Urey 
Hall parking lot after he 
disallowed the tying basket in 
a playoff game. Three other 
cars were damaged by the 
explosion, so he is labeled too 
great a risk by those in charge 
of parking. 

Once he does manage to 
make his way onto campus, 
the referee ' s existence 
resembles something out of a 
James Bond movie. He is a 
man of a thousand faces - a 
beard one day, maybe a 
mustache the next. His 
sunglasses hide any 
identifiable feature. and

crowd unnoticed. The losing 
team from last Wednesday's 
game vowed to "get" him. 

The referee rarely travels 
this campus on the usual 
paths. He can occasionally be 
found lurking in the shadows 
behind Bonner Hall or darting 
through the woods oFf of 
Gilman Drive. No path is sale 
enough for his travel . 

His meal card has long 
since been revoked. It is 
rumored that last Halloween's 
Revelle Cafeteria food fight 
was the result of four referees 
being pelted with salads. After 
the plates had settled, five 
students were taken into 
custody .. 

The referee's academic life 
suffers the most. He will sit 
alone in class if he can get in at 
all. Sometimes he is forced to 
arrive early and leave a tape 
recorder, only to return for it 
after the rest of the class has 
left. There are a few 
sympathetic professors on 
campus who will allow referees 
to take exams in separate 
rooms to alleviate some of the 
pressures that the ref i, under. 

The lifestyle inevitably 
takes ils toll . One Former 
referee reported in at the 
beginning of a season at six 
feet tall and 180 pounds. 
When the season ended, he 
was five foot-three and a mere 
125 pounds. Though this is a 
severe case, the physica" 
beating a referee must endure 
takes a backseat to the 
psychological traumas 
suffered. 

A recent study of 25 former 
, referees at UCSD speaks for 

itself. All but four wenl on to 
develop severe neurotic 
conditions of one form or 
another . OF the 25, ] 9 were 
Forced to undergo intensive 
psychotherapy. Six went to 
prison for violent crimes, three 
joined the Foreign legion, two 
became monks and three 
became members of Richard 
Nixon's White House staff. 
Four former referees have 
disappeared from society 
altogether.

traumas and the various types 
of stress would make the

'Being' There' Works Where Book Fails 
By Ted lUke

Wdh a Awry of hype preceding ill 
debut in San Diego, it • understandable 
why someone might see director Hal 
Ashby'. new film, Beinl There wilh a 
"Ihow me" altitude usually, limited to 
citizenI of Miaouri. 

The film, baaed on the aame-named 
~ Jerzy KOIiNIci (who wrote the 

y a. well), had opened up a 
good months earlier in New York 
auld Loe Angeles, and the advance 
reports from laate-making critic.

a good lim that gives the audience the 
usUally doubtful dose of "something to

more IUl'priaing for me, though, was 
Jerzy KOlinski'. la'eenplay, with 
which he, to use an acrane adjective,

to fit the film medium like a nut and 
bolt. 

KOIirwki'l noveJ concerned the 
doing. of a retarded ,ardner named 
Chance. Chance, who. world view is 
limited tt' tending a garden and 

wa1chin, . unwholesome amount. of 
lV, is forced to leave the house he'. 
known all his known life when the old 
man who'd been taking care of him 
m.uy kick. oft. Nattily dreaaed in a 
auit from the old man'l wardrobe, 
Chance meets up with Eve Rand, the 
wife of Benjamin Rand, a dying multi-
millionaire indultrialist king-maker 
who'. con.tantly courted by 
pre.ident., .enatorl, and foreign 
dignatariei. Chance. who's name i, 
mangled by thi. time to Chauncy 

Chance understands Rus.ian when 
Chance ju.t rioda, smiling dwnbly, 
when the ambassador rattles off verses 
by hi. favorite Russian poet. Through 
out all of thi', Chance's replies to 
questions are vague, uncertain, and 
limited to his coamology of TV and 
gardens, but the charActers around 
him, desperate for a hero with a note of 
optimism in their world of money, 
power politic" and dead-pan cynicism, 
continue to take his half-wit utterances 
as the musingl of a poet, a vi,ionary, 

writers have floundered in their own 
cheap·shot philolophical pre.ump-
tiona In Being There, though, the 
author retained his distanced tone, and 
being unable to explore his premise any 
deeper, produced a cut-am1-dry book 
where the jokes, or more exactly, joke, 
died page after page. 

Director Ashby, though, must have had 
a long talk with osinski and gave him 
some needed pointers. 

Director Ashby, though, must have 
had a long talk with Kosinski (who, 
acting a8 an artist "protecting the 
integrity of his work, wrote the film 's 
screenplay), and gave him some 
needed pointers· on how to make the 
comic elements come alive on the 
screen. The dialogue is bone-bare and 
unadorned, as in the novel, but 
Ko.inski's lines carry more weight on 
the screen . Ashby hat dragged some 
first rate performances from his actors , 
with the results being that they're able 
to by-pa,s the intended sublties of the 
author and translate them into general 
purpote humor. 

Gardener, is taken to be a man of 
supreme taste, intelligence and 
intensity. and impreaaes Benjamin 
enough to be introduced to the 
President. 

After being introduced, the 
President querie. Chance about what 
the country lhould do to stimulate the 

"g~" of the economy. Hearing the 
werd "growth", Chance draws on the 
only thing he really know. about and 
deliver. a trite homily to the effect that 
if the rools are .trong, one can .urvive 
the barren winter and look forward to 
growth in the spring. From ther~, 
Chance i. catapulted into national 
celebrity. The P . t i. thoroughly

courted by the editor of a major 
buaineaa magazine, appears. on a talk-
.how, and i. iovellifUlled by both the 
CIA and the FBI, makes a favorable 
imprellion on a blustery Soviet 
ambassador who mi.takenly think. 

and a supreme intellect. 
As one could easily infer, Kosinki 's 

nova operates on a level no more 
complex than a shaggy dog story, and 
the reader, once getting what there is of 
the punchline, has to wade through too 
many pages to witness the idea to take 
on it', absurd permutation.. The 
problem with the book was with 
Kosinaki, who at the time was dealing 
with a genre - the comic novel - he 
had no bu.iness dealing with. 

Kosin.ki's Itrengths as a novelist are 
best witnessed when he', grim and 
relentle .. ly fatalistic . Hi. principal 
characters, cast-iron post exi.tential

hard knock. that their proge .. through 
variagated sexual and violent 
encounters is taken in an eerie .late of 
grace thatsugge.lI a psychic no·man's 
land, are .killfully handled by Kosinski. 
His terse, di.tanced, and nearly poetic 
pro.e style has enabled him to write a 
aerie. of novels (Stetn. The Painted 
Bird, The Devil Tree, Blind Date) that 
succeed ae.thetically where other 

Peter Sellers, as Chance, is 
especially magical. Where the 
character in the book seemed flat and 
abstract, Seller's protrayal of him as a 
wide.eyed , well-meaning , idiot savant 
adds a morehuman element, the 
element of an uncomprehending riding 
the crest of events that've elevated him 
to loftier and higher stations. Shirley 
McLaine as Eve, Melvyn Douglas all 
Benjamin, and Jack Warden as The 
President all flesh out their characters 
with an unerring tense of closed· 
system gullibility. 

Alhby wisely never lets the 
characterizations fall into buffoonery. 
Instead, his insistence that his players 
deal with their character's quirks as 
something given in the flow of 
everyday give and take - there's a 
certain matter-of·factness about the 
film that I admire - Being There 
manages to be funny without being 
slap.tick or a comedy of manners.

'Being There' Works Where Book Fails 
By Ted Burb

Wlih a ftwry of h~ preceding its

why someone might lee director Hal

"Ihow ~ .. attitude usually. limited to

limited to his cosmology of TV and 
gardena, but the characters around

optimi.m in their world of money, 
power poIitiCll, and dead-pan cynicism, 
continue to take his half-wit utterances 
as the musing. of a poet, a vilionary, 

writers have floundered in their own

Director Ashby, though, mu.t have 
had a long talk with Ko.inski (who, 
acting as an arti.t "protecting the 
integrity of his work. wrote the film's 
screenplay), and gave him some 
needed pointers on how to make the 
comic elements come alive on the 
screen. The dialogue is bone-bare and 
U1adorned, as in the novel, but 
Kosinski's line. carry more weight on 
the .creen. Ashby has dragged some 
first rate performances from his actors, 

~th the results being that they're able 
to by·pass the intended sublties of the 
author and translate them into general 
purpo.e humor.

which he, to use an acrane adjective.

to fit the film medium like a nut and 
bolt. 

KOlinski's novel concerned the 
doings of a retarded ,ardner named 
Chance. Chance, who s world view is 
limited to tending a garden and 

Gardener, is taken to be a man of 
.upreme lalte, intelligence and 
intensity, and impre.... Benjamin

President. 

After being introduced, the 
President queries Chance about what 
the country .houId do to .timulate the 

"g~" of the economy. Hearing the 
werd "JPOwth", Chance draws on the 
only thing he really know. about and 
deliver. a trite homily to the effect that 
if the roots are strong, one can survive 
the barren winter and look forward to 
I':owth in the spring. From ther~, 
Chance is catapulted into national 
celebrity, The Pl'elident i. thoroughly 
taken with what he perceive. al 
"Chauncy Gardener's" unique 
philosophical optimism, quotes him, 
with due aedit. during a televiaied 
State of the Union speech_ Chance il 
courted by the editor of a major 
buainell magazine. appears on a talk-
show, and i. inv~ted by both the 
CIA and the FBI, make. a favorable 
impreuion on a blustery Soviet 
"",bauador who mistakenly thinks 

and a supreme intellect. 
A. one could ea.ily infer. Kosinki 's 

novel operates on a level no more 
complex than a shaggy dog story, and 
the reader, once getting what there i. of 
the punchline. has to wade through too 
many pages to witness the idea 10 take 
on it'l absurd permutations. 1he 
P!"Obiern with the book was with 
Kosinski, who at the time was dealing 
with a genre - the comic novel - he 
had no bu.inell dealing with. 

Kosinski's strengths as a novelist are 
be.t witnelled when he's grim and 
relentleuly fatali.tic, His principal 
characters, ca.t·iron po.t exiltential 
types who've been so brutalized by 
bfe's endJeli series of bad breakl and 
hard knock. that their progeu through 
variagated .exual and violent 
encounters is taken in an eerie state of 
grace that sugge ... a psychic no-man's 
land, are skillfully handled by Ko.in.ki. 
Hia terse, distanced, and nearly poetic 
prose .tyle has enabled him to write a 
aerie. of novels (Steps, The Painted 
Bird, The Devil Tree. Blind Dote) that 
succeed aesthetically where other 

Peter Sellers, as Chance, is 
especially magical. Where the 
character in the book seemed flat and 
abstract, Seller's protrayal of him as a 
wide-eyed, well-meaning, idiot savant 
adds a morehuman element, the 
element of an uncomprehending riding 
the crest of events that've elevated him 
to loftier and higher .tations. Shirley 
McLaine as Eve. Melvyn Douglas as 
Benjamin, and Jack Warden as The 
President all flesh out their characters 
with an unerring .ense of closed-
system guUibility. 

Ashby wisely never lets the 
characterizations fall into buffoonery. 
Instead. hi. insistence that his players 
deal with their character'. quirks as 
something given in the flow of 
everyday give and take - there's a 
certain matter-of-factness about the 
film that I admire - Being There 
manage. to be funny without being 
slapstick or a comedy of manner •.

Movie 'Cruising' Spurs Gay Protests 
SAN FRANCISCO. "Cruising," a brutally frank film 
about a kiDer preying on New York homosexuals, 
opens Friday u gays, fearin, copycat violence, plan 
demonatrationa at theaten showing the film. 

In San Francisco, where homosexuals account for 
about 15 percent of the 665,000 population, a group 
called "Stop the Movie Cruising Coalition" plana to 
protest at the St. Francis, one of the two theaten let

audience included Dick Cavett, Norman Mailer and 
cartoonist Gary Trudeau, was picketed by about 30 
gay men and lesbians, resuming protests that beta 
last summer when Friedkin filmed in the city'. 
Greenwich ViUage section. The issue of censonhip has been raised as 

hornoIexuai grouP' angrily debate whether the film 
poea a menace to them or a chance to publicize their 
little-undentood lifestyle. 

United Artists, the movie's distributor, said theat. 
owners can deduct costs of extra security from the 
receipts, before the profits are sent on to UA. 

"It's a very obviously anti·gay movie," said 
Michael Dawson, head of the coalition. "It presents 
gay men as willing victims of violent crime. We're 
victims, all right, but we're not willing." 

Afterwards, Friedkin was criticized by Arthur Bell, 
a gay activist and film critic for the Village Voice 
newspaper. Bell called F riedkin "the worm of worms" 
and said the film could do "nothing but harm a lot of 
people." 

The fihn, which initially wiD be shown at abqut 600 
theater. in the United States and Canada, is directed 
by William Friedkin, who directed "The Exorciat" 
and won a 1972 Academr Award for "The French 
Connection." It stars AI Pacino as an undercover 
police officer investigating a series of murders in 
which the victims are all homosexual. 

Dawson said the movie has "no redeeming social 
or intellectual value."

"It can cause psychological and possibly physicJ 
violence, and I condemn you for making it," Bell told 
Friedkin. 

"The film never intends to show what gay life is 
about," Friedkin said at a news conference.

Arranging interviews with 
these outcasts was incredibly 
difficult. Most ignored our 
phone calls, and one didn't 
understand English. Finally 
one did come forward, 
anonymously. 

Beneath the dark glasses, 
there were .beads of sweat 
pouring down his trembling 
face while he sat with us. He 
felt uncomfortable being seen 
by 10 many people at once 
(there were 0'!!Y three of us in 
the room). The student, a 
pitiful shell of his former self, 
was unable to describe the 
torrents of abuse he had been 
through. When the interview 
was over, he rose, shakily at 
first, and began to head for the 
door. All that could be heard 

In addition to the high 
percentage of student

the cost per student athlete is

school.
