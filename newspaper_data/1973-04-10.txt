Triton Wargaming: The Games People Play 
Rick Drom 

Last Thursday Mark Horton, a student 
at UCSD, destroyed three tanks before 
his fighte r was shot down. Horton wasn't 
hurt though because the action all took 
place in 'room 506, on Matthews Cam-
pus. 

Horton is the current president of the 
Triton Wargaming Society, a club at 
UCSD devoted to the simulation of 
battle. Each Thursday the club, which 
has over 50 members, meets to battle 
once again. 

Some of the games are re-creations 
of famous battles, like the Battle of the 
Bulge or Waterloo . Others involve 
miniature scale models of men and 
equipment from a historical period. 
These are very exact, down to the color 
of a grenadier's insignia . 

But other games which the Socie ty 
plays are not bellicose at all. In order to 
win those games a participant has to 
accomplish a set objective; such as 
keeping the peace or surviving in the 
wilderness. 

To liven up the games th members 
will invent new rules or complications 
for themselves; they might pit an army 
against another army which had fought 
in a diff r nt ce ntury. In addition they 
will oft n invent new games. 

One past president, Conn LaMotte , 
said that h spends about 10 hours a 
week on th se games. He said that he 
creates almost one new gam each 
week . 

These new games are more than just 
re-hashes of old battles. Th members 
attempt to develop whole new ap-
proaches to combat through unique 
handicap systems . 

Besides enjoyment, these new games 
can become profitable items. " ew, 
good games can be sold," Horton said, 
"fo r anywhere between 3 and 15 
dollars ." Many new games are adver-
tized and sold in special war-gaming 
magazines. 

Horton also pointed out that these 
games are far from childish and wasteful. 
"Many large think-tanks, like the Rand 
Corporation, rely heavily on games to 
simulat pos ibl future d elopments," 
he said . 

The club was organized at UCSD two 
years ago. The members enjoy playing 
these games for a variety of reasons. 

" I enjoy the conflict involved," said 
Horton. " Also it takes out aggression, 
gives me a feel for the historical situation 
and allows me to figure out what could 
have happened." 

Members of the Triton Wargaming Society meet every Thursday evening 
in Matthews 506 to recreate famous battles. 

In addition there are man 
sociological games which have been 
designed to tea h their participants 
through role playing. Games like these 
show a player what it would b like to b 
a corporate giant or to b a member of a 
minorit that is discriminated again t. The members research each battle 

very carefully, often spending hours 
pouring over history texts, before begin-
ning to play. They are concerned about 
all details which lead to the victory or 
defeat of a force; including the size of 
each army, th strength of the weapons 
it possessed, its condition, its training, 
etc. Through this knowledge they can 
confidently predict the odds of a par-
ticular maneuver succeeeding. 

The games are played with a die and 
elaborat e table of odds. The roll of the 
die tell s what happe ns at each turn and 
how the other sid reacted. 

In a way these games are much like 
the Sporls J/Ju Iral d football gam s 
which compare ' rival football teams on 
the basis of last year's statistics. In fact 
the society sometimes even plays these 
games. 

The participants often become really 
involved in the outcome of a match . As 

Med School Building Cutbacks 
Laura Scudder 

The UCSD Medical School has had to reorganize and reduce the costs of expansion 
plans because of the lack of federal funding to cover construction of medical facilities . 

Dr. Clifford Grobstein, Dean of the Medical School , and Vice-Chancellor for Health 
Sciences, cites as effects the abandonment of plans to build clinical teaching fa cilities at 
Universi ty Hospital and a clinical science building on campus. 

Plans Redesigned 
Plans have been redesigned to give the Medical School faculty the same amount of 

space as originally planned, but in "low rise, cheaper construction of wood and plaster 
mod ular buildings." The plans had called for structures of reinforced concrete. David 
Ryer, assistant to the Chancellor, estimates that the newly planned buildings will be 
" less costly for the first twenty years, but in the long run , will be more expensive" than 
the original buildings would have been to maintain . 

One part of the original plans which will be retain d is the construction of an 
outpatient clinic wing at the hospital. 

Federal Funding Cut 
The federal funds which the Medical School officials had hoped for were to have 

come from Propo ition 2, passed last November. With its passage, California became 
e ligible to ask for about $100 million in federal funds, and for up to $156 million in 
bonds to be bought by the state. According to Ryer, "UCSD now is authorized to ask 
permiss ion to bui ld medical facilities," but "the fed ral budget in recent years has 
included no money for construction for the medical sciences." 

Building With State Dollars 
Dr. Grobstein also said that th UCSD Medical School "ca n' t count on f d ral 

funding" and " will have to build just with state dollars." 
Ry r tr ssed that" v n though federal money is not forth coming, consid rabl 

bui lding can be done in the hospital and the Medical hool through Proposition 2 
fun ds." Dr. Grob t in estimates that money inv sted in new building over th n xt two 
y ar will b "consid rabl ", perhaps $10 million, to b finan c d by Proposition 2 
bonds. 

Admi Ion Decelleratlon 
A~o~h r ff ct discussed by Dr. Grob tein is th de erlation the numb r of 
adm~ slon to th Medi al School. Th origina lly planned admission of nin ty six n w 
m dl al stud nts this year will not b rea liz d , according to Dr. Grab t in, for anoth r 
two or th ree y ars.

Horton said, " When a plan gets shot 
down you care wheth r the pilot had 
tim to eject; b caus you are th 
pilo!." 

Beca use of this enthusiasm player~ 
e nd up shouting and cursing at each 
other after particularly effective 
maneuvers . 

The games can last fro"m five minutes 
to five days. Often the members will 
begin fig ht ing at 6 in the evening and 
continue straight until 2 in the morning. 

News Analysis 

Horton beli ves that games ar not 
only entertaining but ducational as 
well . "Isn't it much better to playa game 
and learn the lesson that way, whether it 
be in terms of war or politics, than to 
have to play the games in real life?" he 
asked . 

The So iety invites all who are in-
terested to come to their meeting each 
Thursday at 7 p.m . in room 506 MC

Professor at UCSD for one month as of 
April 8. 

His visit to UCSD is sponsored by the 
Department of literature. During his 
stay he will give three Monday after-
noon lectures (April 16, 23 and 30) and 
one evening public lecture on 
Wednesday, April 18. 

The Monday series, to be held at 3

vatives that he could make "a responsi-
ble presentation of a radical point of 
view." The paper ceased publication in 
December 1971 and Stone became a 
contributing ed itor to the "New York 
Review of Book'. "

Cal-PIRG 
Elections 

Cal - PIRG, the California Publ ic 
Interest Resea rch Group, will hold elec-
tions next week for the UCSD Board of 
Directors. 

All students at UCSD are eligible to 
vote and all will receive election ballots 
in the mail. The packet will contain a 
description of Cal-PIRG, a list of the 
candidates running and a postage-paid 
postcard . 

Each student can mark five of the 
boxes on the post-card corresponding 
to the candidates listed on the sheet. 
After the postcards are mailed back to 
Cal-PIRG the votes will be counted. The 
five candid<ltes who receive the most 
votes will be elected to the UCSD Cal-
PIRG Board. 

Anyone interested in helping to mail 
these ballots should stop by the 
Fishbowl or call X1030. 

. Since all 6,000 ballots must be stapled, 
labeled and sorted, there is much work 
to be done. Cal-PIRG would appreciate 
any time that students cou ld spare to 
help out. 

Any questions about the election ca n 
be answered by Dan Franklin, the Cal-
PIRG director, at 236-1509.

This Week in Sacramento 
SACRAMENTO - The passage and 
signing of Assembly Bill 387 has assured 
the continued operation until June 30 of 
child care centers affected by proposed 
federal cutbacks. The cutbacks would 
eliminate 30,000 of the 45,000 eligible 
chi ldren , including 90 percent of 
chi ldren of migrant laborers and all 
children l!ttending campus children 
centers. 

The bill , authored by Assembly 
Speaker Bob Moretti, provides sa.8 
million for the centers until June 30. 
Further legislation for full time funding 
is now being drafted. 

SACRAMENTO - The State Assembly 
voted 65 to 7 to abolish a law which 
resulted in large increases in the 
amounts of money adult children were 
required to pay toward the Old Age 
Security aid their elderly parents 
received. 

Assemblyman Joe Gonsalves of los 
Angeles, author of the Assembly bill , 
said the 1971 law has been a total failure. 
He said that the Administration had 
estimated benefits of $20 million would 
be received by the State, but projections 
by the Auditor General show the total 
will be about $7.7 million. Half of that 
will go to the federal government for its 
participation in the assistance program. 

The law has also proven deficient in 
regard to families by causing dissension , 
feelings of guilt and economic hardship. 
The bill will eliminate the entire system 
of relative responsibility payments. 

SANGER - loretta de la Toree, student 
body president of Sanger High School, 
has filed as a candidate for the Sanger 
Unified School District board of trustees: 

. M s. Toree is one of the youngest citizens 
ever to file for elective office. 

SACRAMENTO - For the third year in a 
row a' No-Fault Insurance Bill has been 
introduced by Assemblyman Jack Fen-
ton. The bill passed the Assembly for the 
second year and is now waiting for a 
hearing in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. 

The odds are considered better than 
ever for No-Fault this session if it is 
approved by the Judiciary Committee. 
The bill is expected to pass on the Senate 
floor and be signed by the Governor, 
who has endorsed the idea. 

SACRAMENTO - A report recommen-
ding a collective bargaining system 
covering most of the public employees 
in California and stressing the resolution 
of deadlocks through coluntary 
procedures rather than biding com-
pulsory . arbitration was made public 
here by the Advisory Council on Public 
Employee Relations. 

The statute recommended by the Ad-
visory Council would cover all publiC 
workers except management, confiden-
tia l and supervisory employees. Also 
exempt would be elected public officials 
and workers covered by tran si t district 
acts. It would guarantee workers the 
right to organize and negotiate with the 
public employer over wages, hours, and 
other terms and condi tion s. 

Where Does It Hurt. .. 
continued from page 1 

as everyone else while their wages remain the same, or even go down to make the 
products they create more competitive with foreign goods made with cheaper labor. 

The unemployed will be among the most sharply affected. As prices go up the 
unemployment payments or food stamps or welfare they now receive will not go up 

propor~ionately, and may even drop. Nixon continues to cut back on federal spending 
on SOCIal welfare programs enough to offset his increases in defense spending and 
other non-social welfare spending. 

For students, devaluation means higher prices for all their necessities along with 
cutbacks in federal government funds for scholarships, student loans, research projects, 
and equal opportunity programs. 

Just as .hig~er food. prices ~ean greater profits for agribusiness conglomerates, so the 
devaluation IS a healrng shot In the corporate arm for the nation's largest multinational 
corporations and financial institlItions. Although in long range terms, even the largest 
American corporations will be battered by Japanese and Western European com-
petitors, the immediate effect of the devaluation has been higher profits. 
. Because th~ multinationals have branches everywhere, they deal in several curren-

Cies, and can Juggle them to take advantage of small changes in currency values. These 
multinationals, along with Middle Eastern oil sheiks and rich speculators, unloaded 
hundreds of millions of dollars just before the devaluation so they would not be 
caught with the devalued dollars. And now the lower priced dollar makes their 
American-made products more competitive on the world market. 

Theoretically, if you believe that greater profits 'trickle down' to workers, then all will 
benefit from these increased sales. But if, as has been the case of late, these extra profits 
are invested in factories abroad where labor is cheaper and taxes are lower, then the 
greater profits will not be passed on to American workers and consumers at all. 

Amer~ca'~ largest banks, like Chas~ Manhattan and Bank of America, are not being 
left behind In the rush to greater profits. They, too, speculated to great advantage in the 
devaluation . And they often loan funds to the great multinationals to make investment 
abroad possible. 

Under present conditions, banks and multinationals will continue to see that their 
intrests are served. Organized labor may offset some of business's gains by 'quid pro 
quo' deals like those Meany and Nixon just made.

Response to 
Vietnam: 
IWhat Kind 
of Peace?' 

I am su re you have 
already got questions in 
your mind about this title, 
and you think you saw it 
before: you did! This is a 
reply to the San Diego In-
dochina Peace Campaign's 
article. They made several 
controversia l statements 
that I wish to set straight. 
For example, they wrote 
"Nguyen Van Thieu heads 
a popular, democrati c 
government" is a myth, 
and stated that "the Viet 
Cong takeover Nixon fears 
would come through the 
free election rpomised in 
the Peace Agreement." 
This is grossly wrong ; 
although admittedly Thieu 
may not be very 
democratiC, he is popular. 
In an interview for US 
NEWS AND WORLD RE-
PORT (Feb . 19, 1973), Sir 
Robert Thomp on, British 
autho rity on southeast 
Asia, states, "I do not see 
any coalition co ming 
about. The Communists 
were not strong enough to 
fo rce one during the 

ceasefire negotiations . 
They cannot win it in the 
elections. From the 
Government point of view, 
the sooner any elections 
involving the National 
liberation Front are held 
the better. The Govern~ 
ment would win an enor-
mous majority - 85 per 
cent or more - in ' elec-
tions under international 
supervision."

THE LIFE AND DEATH OF 

ADOLF 
HITLER 

by Robert Payne 
. More than twenty-five years after his death, Adolf 

Hitler still throws a shadow over the twentielh century. 
Even those spared the horrors of Hitler's wars and 
atrocities must wonder how this man cast a spell over 
Germany, conquered most of Europe, and was 
prevented from his dream of world conquest only by 
history's bloodiest war. 

In The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, Robert Payne 
rec~nstructed Hi.tler's growth Into a man who gradually 
realized that hiS ability to mesmerize audiences 
assured him success as a politician after he had failed 
at everything else. Payne, who once met Hitler and was 
brrefly Involved in a plot to assasinate him. points out 
that Hitler was a man of Intense personal charm, highly 
attractive to both men and women. 

Payne's book IS likely to become the standard 
biography of Hitler for ItS vast amount of Information 
and its highty readable style. The fifty Illustrations 
Include revealing Informal snapshots from Eva Braun's 
personal photo album.

defeated it. He gained 
even more support for the 
way he stood up - to the 

Ameri~ans and everybody 
- durrng the negotiations 
and got South Vietnam the 
best terms." 

Isn ' t it funny how 
quoting new spa per 
editorials, instead of ex-
perts and authorities in the 
field can mislead the publ ic 
in believing what simply 
Isn't true!

My Education 
Hank Steiman 

As my second year here at the Magic Kingdom comes to an end, I realize that I 
have actually learned a thing or two that have somehow added importance to my 
life . These important observations are listed as follows: 

AT UCSD I HAVE LEARNED THAT: 
1) I must remember to exchange my bed sheets every Tuesday. 
2) Guys wearing dark sunglasses write for the "North Star." 
3) A change of underwear must be made every few days, so as to avoid 

embarrassment. 
4) Sexy-looking Revelle girls usually have boyfriends going to U.c. Irvine (why 

Irvine?). 
S) Eating frequently in the cafeteria can cause terminal diarrhea (I should know). 
6) Shopping at Safeway is a no-no. 
7) People who like my articles are crazy and should be put away. 
Anyway, it seems that contrary to popular opinion, there are actually a few courses 

that I have found here at the "House of Wax" that are actually quite in,eresting and 
are guaranteed to "whet your intellectual appetite", or your money back. I have 
conveniently jotted down some of the courses offered here at UCSD which I think 
you'll enjoy; I hope you will take time to explore them. 

COURSES 
A.P.I.S. 10 - INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE : THE DIGITAL COMPU-

TER (Fall) 
Course lectures will be on computer organization and operation, algorithms, 

flow charts, and Algol programming of TIC-TAC-TOE games. By mid-course, 
students will become increasingly frustrated with the computer, and by the 
course's end, the class will proceed to beat the machine to death with 
sledgehammers. The professor will also discuss why obtaining a degree in 
computer science "would be a rather foolish thing to do." 

Biology 6 -INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGY (Fall) 
The essentials of cell biology, elementary cell chemistry, genetics, and the 

biological basis of certain disease states will be emphasized the first half of the 
course. The second portion of the course will focus on : ribosomes and 
chromosomes, why they never date; ten warning signals to know whether or not 
you've passed away; and the liver : where it's located, and why it's always good 
with bacon. 

Economics 1A - BEGINNING ECONOMICS (Fall) 
This introductory course in economics will familiarize the student with 

"supply and demand", average and marginal cost curves, and the "Law of 
Diminishing Returns." Other topics in economics that will be discussed will be : 
how to borrow money from a friend; getting shortchanged, and how to 
rE:taliate; and why it's good to have money. 

History 100 - HISTORY OF BOLIVIA 
Course will focus on the study of Modern Bolivian society in a series of weekly 

lectures. Lecture topics will include: how to spend Friday nights in Bolivia; 
Bolivian women : " where to find them"; and" what to do if a Bolivian man tries 
to sel l you a watch." 

History 150- HOMOSEXUALITY AND THE AMERICAN PRESIDENCY 
The topic of homosexuality in the American Presidency has been suppressed 

for a long time by the government because of its obvious implications affecting 
the security of our country. However, with the recent release of the "Harding 
Papers", historians have now discovered that the pol it ical acts and affairs of state 
of the Warren G. Harding Administration were quite notably influenced by 
President Harding's latent homosexual tendencies: "Teapot Dome" thus being 
"a sort of phallic symbol", and the entire Oil Scandals being nothing more than 
the manifestations of President Harding's being a fag. Students will also discover 
from their readings that Harding's Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, 
remarked in his own personal diary that "at Cabinet meetings, Harding was 
constantly touching my kneel" Hoover also stated that he frequently had to 
change his seat, so as not to publicly embarrass the President. (No prerequisites 
required .) 

InterdiSCiplinary 10 - INTERPERSONAL BEHAVIOR, GROUP DEVELOPMENT, and 
LEADERSHIP STYLES (Winter) 

As a means of exploring the dynamics of human interaction, each student will 
b om a member of a small unstructured group. Students will also b required 
to record their nightly dreams. The dreams will then be analyzed by the entire 
class 50 as to determine exactly what is wrong with you, and why you don' t have 
any friends . 

Language 20 - PROFANITY AS A SECOND LANGUAGE 
Students at UCSD are encouraged (and in many cases coerced) into taking 

another language so as to become bilingual. In this course, students (with the 
help of native speakers acting as tutors) will first be taught how to rudely insult 
th ir close friends. From there, students will then begin talking dirty to their 
parents, and, ultimat Iy, profici ncy will be reached with each individual 
student shouting out obscenities in a public r staurant. 

Philosophy 100 - PHiLOSOPHERS AND THEIR PHILOSOPHIES 
This course will attempt to introduce the student to some of the more well -

known philosophers in history, as well as being an in-d pth study of their 
philosophies. The particular philosophers cover d will range from Friedrich 
NietlSche ("God is dead") to Mickey Mantle ("H thr w me a fast ball around 
the letters")' As a sp ial treat, th final half of the course will be a s minar 
entitled, "Kierkegaard and Sartre: Why they couldn't score with girls." 

Visual Arts 15B - THE RENAl SAN E ART COURSE (Winter) 
A cours aim d at exposing th student to R nai san Art . Stud nts will 

quickly learn how to t II the difference between a fresco-painting and a piece of 
I mon m ringue pie. Th class will then be taught how to paint a three bedroom 
hous using just on oat. Finally th students will examine the life and works of 
th gr at Lonardo da Vin i, including hi p uliar obs sinn for larg snak s.

through a poor use of cliches, no

On the other hand, Arthur Indians, depicts his Red Men

but also because of the Indian 's to understa nd the ways of 
the white men. Sitting Bull, the maior li:hilrac:ter, is equally defeated 
by his stubborness as well as the "Great White Father."

Playwright 
Speaks 

The Drama Department 
and the Campus Program-
ming Board are co-
sponsoring a lecture by the 
di st inguished Bla ck 
playwright, Mr. Ed Bullins, 
in the UCSD Theatre on 
Thursday, April 12 at 8:00 
p.m. At only 35 years of 
age, h has 34 plays, short 
sto ries and poems to his 
cr dit. He has won the 
Obie Award, the Vernon 
Rice Award and received 
gra nts from the Rockefeller 
and Guggenheim foun -
dations. 

Mr. Bullins is Playwright 
in Residence at the NeW 
Lafayette Theatre, an ex-
perimental profeSSional

Harlem and the American 
Place Theatre, a foremost

on -act play by Mr. Bullins,

Invit('d . 

Asaad Kelada, director of Indians, seems to realize 
t~e flaws of the script, and similar to the actors, directrs 
himself out of humiliation. For instance, in the scene in 
which Buffalo Bill shoots 100 Buffalo with 100 bullets 
four " buffalo" die on the stage. These "buffalo" ar~ 
"Indians" wearing buffalo heads . The analogy and 
metaphor seem quite obvious; through the extermina-
tion of the buffalo, the white man exterminated the 
!ndian. !hat. is, Kelada succeeds, through his direction, 
tr. making Interesting metaphoric statements, while 
Kopit fails to do so in his script. 

Indians failes to condemn the white men as criminals 
who committed genocide upon the original inhabitants 
of North America . Arthur Kopit's portrayal of the white 
men as victims of their foolishness seems to dismiss the 
criminal nature that their actions took. The audience is 
allowed to say, "It's too bad that the Indians were 
slaughtered," but is not given the opportunity to 
invoke any analogy or response to the actions of the 
white American Government in 1973. 

Indians will be playing at the Old Globe until April 
29. 

Cody in Concert 
Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen 

started out as a rock band playing at fraternity beer 
busts. later, they went through some minor changes 
(one of them being a 38-piece ensemble including the 
"Galactic Twist Queens") . They have si nce whittled 
their entourage down to eight hard-core musicians and 
are now one of the most popular groups in the Bay 
Area . Their two lP's on Paramount records : "Ozone" 
and "Hot Licks, Cold Steel, and Truckers Favorites" 
have done very well. And they had a hit Single you may 
recall , "Hot Rod Lincoln." 

Their music can be considered a combination of 
Rock & Roll and Country & Western - aside from this, 
it defies further classification. For a better idea, you've 
really got to see them. 

Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen will 
perform in concert at the UCSD gym on Friday the 13th 
of April at 9 :00 p.m. Tickets are $2.00 for UCSD students 
with ID and $3.00 general admission. Tickets are 
'available in advance at the Urey Hall Box Office (Tues .-

USIU Badly Mauled 
In Women's Bask.etball 

The women's basketball team con-
tinued their winning ways last Friday by 
topping cross-town rival USIU, 50-26. 
Actually the game wasn't as close as the 
score indicates. The score at halftime 
was 34-5 and at the end of the third 
quarter, UCSD was up by 37 points, 45-8. 

The players and Coach Ron Carter all 
agreed it was possibly the team's finest 
effort to date. Speedy Sharon Wood 
started the scoring spree with a number 
of fine steals, after which she would 
dribble down court for ·an uncontested 
lay up. As it turned out she led all scores 
with 17 points. The Tower of Power, 
otherwise known as Judy Lower, 
chipped in 15 points and pulled down 
any rebound coming her way. Another 
impressive performance was turned in 
by Hillary Chittick whose long outside 
shots aided considerably in loosening up 
the Westerner's zone defense. 

Anyone who has followed the 
women's basketball team or perhaps 
occasionally glanced at the Sports Page 

undoubtedly has noticed the lop-
sidedness of the scores. As the Tritons 
have been running allover their op-
ponents with an average winning margin 
of at least 20 points, it's not surprising 
that the rest of the league hoped to eject 
UCSD on the basis of petty 
technicalities. The solution lies in fin-
ding tougher competition. It is a fact that 
after the All-Cal tourney, UCLA, the best 
women's team on the coast, offered to 
put UCSD in their league. The girls have 
proven their ability to play with top 
flight teams, but are held back by that all 
too limiting factor of any UC San Diego 
sport: money (or more accurately, lack 
of money) . Perhaps nexl year the girls 
will have a budget large enough to 
enable them to play in Los Angeles 
against the type of compeition they 
deserve . 

This afternoon the team faces 
Southwestern, whom they wreaked 
havoc upon the last time the.y met by a 
score of 64-27. 

Sharon Wood (5) heads up court after putting in another lilY u p. Teilmmates Allenil

Spring Superstars 
U nload th~ Big One 

Did you happen to 
wander out on the field last 
Sunday afternoon? If you 
did, then you probably 
have some idea why of all 
the intramural sports, soft-
ball is undoubtedly the 
finest. A prejudiced view-
point , you say? Well, 
maybe partially, but try to 
convince the 66 coed and 
48 men's teams that there is 
a better way to spend a 
sunny afternoon than with 
a bat, ball, glove, and a 
more-than-occasional can 
of beer and you'll be in for 
an incredible hassle. In 
fact, Jim Morrison and his 
cronies were so concerned 
about being able to play 
thai they signed up not 
one, but two men's teams 
with identical rosters . 
C'mon Jim, I've heard of 
trying to double your 
pleasure, but that's going 
too far . 

With such an abundance 
of teams, and with the 
coed tournament being 
played to see who goes to 
All-Cal at Santa Barbara, 
playing field space 

Pat Stacy 
becomes a precious com-
modity. Thus, things are 
going to have to run on a 
little better schedule or 
there will be some disap-
pointed ballplayers. Every 
effort will be made to start 
the games on time. This is 
particufarly important for 
the early morning games (9 
& 10 a.m.) since their being 
late fouls up everybody for 
the entire day. This means 
little Of no infield practice 
(let's face it, if you're ready, 
you're ready; if you're not, 
don't sweat it - just enjoy 
yourselves). If a team 
forfeits twice during the 
season, they will be out 
automatically since the 
times are needed by teams 
that really want to play. 
Another rule change that 
has been made is the 
elimination of the batter's 
box, although a player is 
allowed only one normal 
stride in trying to hit the 
ball. 

If, for some un-
reasonable reason, the sun 
just ain't your bag and soft-
ball and you just don't get 

along, perhaps a change of 
scene and sport would be 
just what you need . 
Gideon's blowing his tubes 
back up and getting ready 
for coed inner-tube water 
polo. Fanatics of this sl!b -
merged sport might di s-
pute my calling softball 
tops, but I think they're just 
all wet. One way or the 
other, this tube-type 
perversion of Wonder 
Boy's wonder game will 
have its captain's meeting 
this Thursday, April 12. 

Speaking of captain 's 
meetings, if you missed the 
one for volleyball last 
Friday, you can still sign up 
until this Thursday. There 
will be two leagues of open 
sixes, a men's doubles and 
a mixed doubles leagu e. 
Volleyball is on Monday 
and Thursday nights this 

. quarter and badminton is 
on Tuesdays. Both of these 
sports, as well as inner-
tube water polo, will be 
represented at All-Cal. 

Philp, Thinclads INC;;ANs 
by Arthur Kopit 

Thump 
La Verne 

The UCSD track team steam rolled to victory last 
Saturday over LaVerne College in front of the home 
town crowd. The UCSD team was once again led by the 
outstanding performance of Mr. Philp. 

Tom ran in five events, his usual task, and was the 
winner in each. He Si ngle-handed ly took first place in 
the 100-yd. dash , the 220-yd . dash and the 120 high 
hurdles. As if this wasn't enough fun and games for an 
afternoon, he also anchored the 440-yd . relay and the 
mile relay . Needless to say, UCSD won both of these 
events. 

There are others on the ' team besides Tom Philp, 
however, and they come in all sizes and events. For 
instance, hat about Bob Sturgeon who finished first il'1 
the high jump? He too deserves a little credit. There 
were also a horde of athletes who finished second , 
featuring such stars as AI Shamble, taking second in the 
long jump, Ed Avol taking second in the 2-mile, and 
Dave Robinson taking second in the javelin. 

These stars will try to continue their winning ways 
Saturday once again in front of the home town crowd. 
The meet will start at 1:00 and feature Pasadena as the 
competition for the afternoon.

H YOU think Kodak is just 
pretty pictures,you ought to have. 

your chest examined. 
When a chest x-ray shows that you have a potential 

killer like TB or cancer, it's not a pretty picture. But it's an 
important picture because it can help the doctor detect and 
catch the killer in time. 

When doctors are out to catch these potential killers, 
they want the sharpest, clearest x-ray films they can get. And 
that's why people at Kodak spend so many hours creating 
new and better x-ray film equipment. Already, the results in-

elude convenience for the patient, economy for the hospital, 
an even more useful tool for the radiologist- and, most impor-
tant, reduced radiation exposure. 

Researching and creating better x-ray films is good 
for our business, which is why we went into them in the first 
place. But it does our society good, too - which isn't a bad 
feeling. After all, our business depends on our society- so we 
care what happens to it.
