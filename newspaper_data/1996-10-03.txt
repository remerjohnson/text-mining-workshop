Low-Cost Housing 
IRVINE, Calif. - Rats, mice 
and tennite are just some of the 
pests sharing UC Irvine's 
Verano Place apartments with 
the legal residents. Besides 
small furry animals, Verano 
resident have complained of 
faulty plumbing and an overall 
·ub. tandard quality of life in the 
low-cost apartments. The UC 
regents gave Verano officials an 
8.3 million grant in June to 

renovate the complex, and the 
Verano Residents Council has 
requested that work begin in 
June 1997 to minimize 
disruptions to residents.

Students Protest 
Lack of Input 
LOS ANGELES - UC 
President Richard Atkinson met 
Tuesday with UCLA Under-
graduate President John Du and 
Graduate President Chris 
Tymchuk to discuss the 
selection of UCLA Chancellor 
Charles Young 's successor. 
Young is retiring at the end of 
this academic year. Du and 
Tymchuk, the two students on 
the 17-member search commit-
tee, were concerned about 
possible "politicization" and the 
level of student input. However, 
Atkinson said the committee is 
"strictly advisory" - the 
committee can choose whom-
ever it like • but the president 
ultimately recommends a single 
name to the regents.

A ROOM WIrfH A VIEW Regents May 
Impose New 
Technology 
Student Fee 
INITIATIVE: Admin trators 
hope to raise $40 million from 
tudents and state sources 

By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

Students at all nine UC campuses will find 
their fall tuition bills between '40 and 60 
larger if an initiative proposed by the C nice 
of the President (UCOP) is incorporated into the 
university ' s 1997-98 budget. 

The "Instructional Technology Fcc," fir ·t 
discussed early this year by the univer!oity 's 
e ecutive budget committee, would il1l:rease 
student fees over a four-to-five Yl'ar period to a 
"speCIfied maximum" of 200. 

The fce is part 01 a three-part " In~lrucllonal 
Technology Initiative" that A~~oclate VIce han-
ce llor for Academic Information Technology 
Gerald Lowell said IS "an attempt to produce a 
much-needed new revenue stream to support a 
vanet of instructional technology aCll v llle~ ." 

Any funds raised arc to be carnldrkeu for 
"improved teaching and learnmg, student sup-
pOri, hbrary access and networks." UC Budget 
Director Larry Hershman stated in a letter to the 
chancellors in early August. 

''I'm ex tremely concerned that thi s new ini-
tiative is a wolf in sheep's clothing," Graduate 
Student Association President Vicki Mayersaid. 
"One problem with the fcc is that it' . unspeci -
fied - wedon ' t know how much we' re goi ng to 
pay, and what for." 

Mayer is one of two student n:presentatives 
10 the comm ittee that IS draftIng SD' s re-
sponse to Hershman's letter. 

According to Hershman. the spendmgguldc-
lines arc written vaguely because "cvery cam-
pus IS an a httle different position," and U OP 
wanted to "gl ve campuses as much flexibility as 
we could." 

ASUCSD President olcen SabatinI , who 
abo serves on the commIttee. said she was also 
worried about the speed at which the initiative 
seemed to be moving. 

Ali i M Isaac/Guardian 
Nestlne: Midterms won't hit UCSD for several weeks yet, but students are already 
flocking to the Geisel Library to take advantage of the air conditioning and clean 
bathrooms - not to mention the score of books - within its steel and glass walls . 

" It seemed to me that is wasn ' t a matter of if 
we were going to have the fee, but 'Since we're 
going to have the fee. what do we want it to go 
for'!' '' Sabatini said. 

Hershman asked each campus to retum a list of 
technological "needs and priorities" by tomorrow,

ERRATA: 
In the September 30 issue of the Guardian, "New UCSD Chancellor 

Starts Off Un-Olympics," it was inaccurately reported that Muir College 
had an Irish theme. Muir actually had a Scottish theme, to honor John 
Muir's birthplace. The Guardian regrets the error. Chips: now what were 
you saying about something "of Scottish origin, in a boltle, unblended 
and aged at least a dozen years"'! 

Do you dream of being a famous cyclist? The UCSD

Administrators Should 
Address Campus Security 

While not quite as serious as it is at other campuses, 
crime is a problem at UCSD any way you slice it. 

The seriousness of our si tuation was made abundantly 
clear at the end of July when a woman attending Camp La 
Jolla, a program designed to encourage weight loss, was 
raped in the Marshall College area. The police have few 
leads in the case as yet. . 

Aside from thi s despicable act, UCSD is plagued by a 
rash of car thefts. Automobiles parked in outlying lots such 
as North and East Parking are particulary vulnerable to 
roaming car thieves. Moreover, it is not uncommon during 
the course of a year to see reports of $30,000 automobile 
stolen from lots closer to the central campus area. 

Clearly the present level of security on campu ' i inad-
equate. UCSD police offi cers simply do not have the 
manpower to patrol either parking lots or residential com-
plexes effectively. If we are to make a dent in the present 
crime wave, something must be done. 

A feasible alternative to hiring more police officers 
would be to drastically expand the Community Service 
Officer program. Instead of just providing "safe walks" to 
students late at night, roving patrols of two or more students 
could keep an eye on vulnerable parking lots, check for 
trouble in buildings late at night and watch for suspicious 
characters hanging around campus. 

An expanded CSO program would mean more jobs for 
students trying to make ends meet, as well as greater 
security for the UCSD community. If the administration is 
really serious about security on campus, they would do well 
to enlist students in the fight against crime. 

Hurray for StudentUnk 
Cooperation. Collaboration. They're dirty words to more 

than a few UCSD departments, but this summer two of them 
managed to set aside their difference and work together 
long Cflough to come up with something that not only 
benefits students, but doesn't even cost us a dime. 

Unlike the proposed Instructional Technology Initiative 
that may eventually zing us for another S200 per year, 
UCSO's new StudentLink system is free . Not only can we 
check our grades on the World Wide Web and see how full 
our fa'vorite classes are, but some time in the next year or so 
we may even be able to register for classes online and check 
our latest bills from the bursar's office. 

Some people are concerned about students' privacy, 
considering the sensitive nature of some of the infonnati~n 
stored online. Fortunately, StudentLink programmers butlt 
in several security measures - and sessions are encrypted 
to prevent electronic eavesdropping. 

Sure, someone with the right tools and plenty of time could 
at least theoretically decrypt your sessiorl and see your grades 
- but realistically, that's not going to happen. As long as you 
make sure to clear the screen before you step away from the 
computer, you don't have anything to worry about. 

Like the university itself, the system is still a work in 
progress - it will grow and change over the next few • 
months, and it will be interesting to see what happens. We II 
be watching. 

Thumbs Up to Voter 
Registration Efforts ...

DECI SIONS '96 

WHY My OPINION Is 
WORTHY AND YOURS ISN'T 
COMMENTARY: Most of us don't bother to question the beliefs 

that we hold, but only those who do are qualified to be published 
By 11_ Joba .... 
Senior Staff Writer 

Having lillic interest in commenting on anything -
the school year, after all, has just started, and little con-
troverSy has been stirred - I thought I would introduce 
myself a bit and present the reason 
why I'm qualified to express my 
opinions and why you probably are 
not. 

After serving as this paper's 
opinion editor last year, and ran-
domly passing that hellish chore on 
to some sick masochist who is this 
year's opinion editor, I have 
returned to writing that which I 
abandoned - my column. 

Two kinds of opinion exist - informed and unin-
formed. However. English doesn't draw a distinction 
between these two concepts. The majority of opinions 
out there are ignorant - that is, most people pass judg-
ment without ever knowing anything about that which 

they are judging. This type of opin-
ion falls under the first entry of 
"opinion" in the American Heritage 
Dictionary - "A belief or conclu-
sion held with confidence but not 
substantiated by positive knowl-
edge or proof." 

Instances of this definition 
include: 

"Smells like sh_t," a handful of 
intellectually handicapped pundits 
will say. But many of these pundits 
share some common characteris-
tics. Besides being intellectually

As you may have gathered, I do

had knowledge and possession of

of occasions, and will probably do so until presented 
with compelling evidence to the contrary. 

However, many students have opinions, whether 
informed or not, on these topics and many more. (~ 
scary thing is that many stude~ts ~ not hav~ an opm-

Sega - but that's another story.) So, wha! m~es ~y

Having broadcast my arrogance high and wide, lei 
me backpedal a bit. 

For starters, my opinion per se is no~ any more qu~l­

If upon fi rst hearing these stories you shook your 

head at the injustice of reverse discrimination and the 
villainy of the president, then you are uninformed. If 
you reacted with horror at the thought that f~tball 
could be considered anything bu~ culture, you are tgno-
rant. 

Rumors and hypothetical situtations do not consti-
tute proof. Lack of evidence does not establish guilt. 
And football is not culture - and even if it is, which it 
is not, I will still hold it i n't. 

So, if you have built your entire opinion around .a 
rumor or a single, isolated event without further inves-
tigalion, then you are not qualified to present your opin-

President Clinton is guilty as hell because ... " and "I like

circus seems to be increasingly 
enamored with the sure thing. From 
bad movies to sleeper Olympic bas-
ketball games, the lesson is Ihe 
same: With millions of dollars 
worth of chips riding on cross-
licensing and marketing fees, the 
only thing that can satisfy the anx-
ious investors in the entertainment 
industries is a solid media 
blitzkrieg. Unless you were living 
in a log cabin in rural Montana 
mailing bombs to your old enemies, 
advertisements for this summer's 
main events were as inescapable as 
America On-Line disks. 

And we, the sucker public, lined 
up at the movie theater and once 
again got fleeced. Come on, admit 
it. You saw "Independence Day," 
didn ' t you? It was Hollywood

"Mission: Imposs ible" was that it 
made reruns of t he TV series more

monolithic black slab in "200 I: A

irresistibly huge it has the power to 
draw nearby objects like hapless 
astronauts (i n thi s case audiences) 
into its inky depths. 

I don't begrudge Hollywood for 
high attendance for good films. I 
can remember plenty of great films

so excited about military service

"Scarface"? And who could forget 
"Dead Poets Society" and that 
crazy teacher, played by Robin 
Williams, who actually gave a rip 
about education? 

Blockbusting sales at the box 
office no longer go to the smartest,

Rather, attendance is scripted by the

The dictionary defines the sec-

public that books like The Wit and 
Wisdom of Forrest Gump managed 
to amble to the top of the New York 

.Times bestseller list. 
As Forrest Gump might say, 

"Mama always told me: Life is like 
a box of choc-Iates. Spread enough 
advertising money around and you 
know what summer blockbuster 
you're gonna get next." 

Jim Carrey proved beyond a 
shadow of a doubt that the $20 mil-

need not be a social scientist or an

It is a tragedy that maverick pro-
ducers who dare defy the lemmings 
in Hollywood find themselves out-
gunned and outmaneuvered by slick 
marketing tricks and promotional 
stunts. Intelligent movies are high 
on the entertainment industry 'S hit 
list. "The Usual Suspects" was the 
last shrewdly produced, brilliant 
movie r saw at the theater. But with-
out the obligatory ad blitz, it lasted 
about as long as a Pat Buchannan

that your opinion hould be broad-

then determine whether or not you

expectations from Hollywood. 
"Indepen&nce Day" was not all 
that bad. While most films were 
two-hour jumbles filled with mind-
numbing drivel. "104" actually had 
moments that made me want to 
stand up and cheer - particularly 
during the aliens' spectacular 
destruction of the White House. 
Clearly the "1D4" aliens had the 
right idea of what sort of garbage 
cleanup was required before they 
could settle on this planet. The only 
tragedy was that it was done at 
night when the weasels were at 
home in their dens, whooping it up 
with nubile congress.ional interns 
and big-pocketed PAC contributors.

manner. The result is always a

to "work under a deadline as well.

as well as a preliminary response by 
September 3 - but Lowell said he 
doesn' t think UCSD will complete its 
response by the deadline. 

"Our local task force has just 
begun to identify potential needs 
that could be met with money from 
the initiative," Lowell said. "We 
have not yet identified funding lev-
els that would be needed for these 
various identified needs, nor have 
we decided how we would deter-
mine which of the needs would re-
ceive funding if there weren' t 
enough money for everything -
which is going to be the case." 

Neither Lowell - who is spear-
heading UCSD's response - or 
Academi c Computing Services 
(ACS) Director Tony Wood could 
provide specific examples of how 
the J:11oney would be used. How-

ever, Wood said ACS plans to in -
crease the number of computer lab 
seat , improve network infrastruc-
ture, increa e the number of hours 
support is available and reduce the 
modem-access fee . 

"This request for information 
from UCOPcame aboutquicklyand 
was a surprise to most of us," Wood 
said. "There has not been time to 
seek more input, although most of 
us have extensive wish li sts from 
our normal planning processes." 

According to Hershman's letter, 
monies raised at the campus level 
would stay at that campus - but 
some of the money could be di-
verted for system-wide projects. 

"The bulk of the instructional 
technology program wi II be planned 
and implemented at the campus 
level ," the letter stated. "However. 
in certain areas ... it may be con-
cluded that substantially increased 
efficiency andlor effectiveness can 
be achieved through overall coordi-
nation andlor by carrying out a 
project at the system level."

money would be siphoned away for 
them. 

The initiative seeks to raise at 
least $40 million through student 
fees, slate funds and donations, with 
an additional amount from do.na-
tions and in-kind gifts from private 
industry . Campuses are also 'ex-
pected to maintain or increase the 
amount of internal funds allocated 
to instructional technology. 

However. Lowell said he was 
unsure UCSD would be able to con-
vince local companies to donate ei-
ther funds or equipment. 

"In-kind contributions are much 
more difficult to procure than they 
were several years ago," he said. 
"Many of the technology finns that 
supported us in the past with in-kind 
contributions have changed their 
internal philanthropy programs and 
are less likely to give in-kind contri-
butions." 

Because the initiative involves 
the state matching the student con-
tribution, it must be incorporated 
into the governor' s 1997-98 state 
budget. 

Hershman said he plans to present 

" Thursday, October 3, 1996 

the initiative to the regents at their 
October meeting, and hopefully to 
receive a decision in November. If 
approved by the regents, the initia-
tive would go before the governor in 
January, and before the state legis-
lature in March. The initiative would 
take effect in the fiscal year that 
begins July I, 1997 . 

Although UC Student Regent 
Jess Bravin said he supported the 
initiative in principle, he voiced his 
concern over the "avalanche of fee 
increases." 

"I think President Atkinson 
should be applauded for his interest 
in keeping UC ahead of the curve 
when it comes to information tech-
nology," he said. "[However), we're 
in a situation where the administra-
tion has for all intents and purposes 
abandoned its 125-yearcommitment 
to providing for the cost of instruc-
tion for higher education." 

According to Hershman, a th ird 
of the fees collected from students 
would be funneled into financial 
aid.

ANGELA JONES STARS AS MURDER-OBSESSED MAID 
IN REB BRADDOCK'S HiLARIOUS BLACK COMEDY 

~ocled: Angela Jones (left) and William Baldwin co-star in ·Curdled.· 

In one memorable scene from 
"Pulp Fiction ," Angela Jones' char-
acter, Esmeralda Villalobos - the 
taxi driver - asks Butch (Bruce 
Willi s) what it was like to kill anoth-
er man in a fight. 

"Are you some kind of weirdo?" 
he asks. 

"No. It's a subject that I have 
much interest in . You are the first 
person I ever met who has killed 
somebody. So what was illike to kill 
a man?" she responds. 

Reb Braddock's new film "Cur-
dled" - also produced by Quentin 
Tarantino - fo l-
lows up on Jones' 
intrepid character, 
now namcd 
Gabricla . In thi s 
black comedy, co-
written and co-pro-
duced by John 
Maass , Gabriela 
works at a post-forensic cleaning 
service in Miami , where she inde-
pendently investigates the murder 
that took place at one cleaning job 
and becomes entangled in Ihe mur-
der itself. 

In an interview with the 
Guardian, Braddock and Jones di s-
cussed the inspiration for Gabriela's 
character and "Curdled" - which 
was actually released four years ago 
as a short film (also starri ng Jones) 
and later picked up by Miramax. 
Guardian: Where did you 
come up for the story idea 
for "Curdled"? 

Braddock: When we were in film 
sc hool , [co-producer and co-author] 
John Maass was my partner and co-
writer, we were going to schoo l in Sara-
sota, Florida, and there were a lot of 
retiree and retired people there who 
lived alone. And what happens quite 
often is that some of these elderly peo-
ple pass away in their trailer by them-
selves and nobody knows about it for 
three week or so. So, there 's a compa-
ny in Sarasota that speciali zes in going 
in and taking out the ir bodies and

Life support: Dr. Guy L than (Hugh Grant) helps a gunshot victim in Michael Apted's "Extreme Measures.· 

Extreme Measures 
Grant and Hackman debate ethics in thriller 

Iy CtvI. Schreiber 
Senior Staff Writer 

If you suddenly became a quad-
riplegic , what would you be willing 
to do to be able to run ag lin? That 
is the question posed to 
Dr. Guy Luthan, played 
by Hugh Grant, in the 
movie "Extreme Mea-
sures," as he lies immo-
bile in a hospital bed. 

Asking Dr. Luthan the 
question is one of the 
America's most honored 
and respected medical 
figures, Dr. Lawrence 
Myric, played by Gene Hackman, 
who presents the ethical query in 
an effort to justify his highly con-
troversial medical research project. 

Luthan is puzzled by the bizarre 
physiological condition of a name-
less patient who he treats in the 
emergency ward at Grammercy 
Hospital in New York. He tries to 

figure out what could" 
have caused the man's 
startling condition. The 
closer Luthan gets to 
finding the truth, the 
more unseen and unex-
plained opposition he 
encounters. His profes-
sional credibility and life 
are endangered as he pur-
sues the answer behind 

his medical mystery man. 
"Extreme Measures," a medical 

thriller based on the novel by 
Michael Palmer, keeps a good level 

of tension fro'm the opening scene 
right up to the closing credits, and 
al 0 gives the audience some trou-
bling ethical dilemmas to confront. 
Balancing the rights of individuals 
against the good of society is the 
underlying conflict of the film . To 
paraphrase Myric , if one could find 
a cure for cancer by killing a single 
person, wouldn' t there be a moral 
obligation to ociety to do so? 

The ending becomes cheesy, 
when Luthan gives Myric a pre-
dictable speech about playing God . 
Nevertheless, the film entertains 
with some plot twists and suspense. 
If you're looking for a movie that 
incites a good hypothetical conver-
sation after its conclusion, this is 
definitely a show to see.

Unnatural 
Incommunicado compiles 

Southern California authors 
By Anlela Boyce 
Guardian Reporter 

From prayers to mid-life cri-

Unnatural Disasters take 
"everyday" life as found in Cali-
fornia and display il as world-
class chefs would - as appetiz-
ing as il may look, it 
may not be good fo r 
you. 

In the compilation. 
edi ted by Nicole Panter, 
each writer employs his 
own unique style in con-
vey ing the message that 
what you see is often 
far from what you get. 

Included in the collection are 
veteran fiction authors, as well as 
some rookies, such as Dave 
Alvin, Diane Sherry Case, Jill SI. 
Jaques. Quincy Pearson, Nicole 
Panter, Pam Kipp, Vaginal Davis, 
Ron Athey, Carol Treadwell and 
Daniel Can. 

Also included in the compila-
lion are authors Benjamin Weiss-

• man, Sandra Zane, Jerry Stahl, 
Bob Flanagan, Bernard Cooper, 
Allison Anders, Jim Kalin, Phong 
Nguyen, Jon Longhi , Nancy Kru-
soc, Bruce Wagner, Peter Plate 
and Dick Hebdige. 

Many of these writers come 
from a background of punk-era 
influence, and all display an abil-

Most noticeably, the writers of

Within the structure of mono-

rub things raw, as

- has once again offered a space 
for a no-holds-barred exhibilion

Much like Califomia's popula-

Descendenls 
Everything Sucks 

epitaph "" ...... 

-**** 

With vocalist Milo Aukerman 
"back from college," Southern Cali-
fornia's legendary '80s pop-punk 
band the Descendents reunited to 
record Everything Sucks on Epitaph 
Records. 

On its latest release, the four-
some continues to produce hard-hit-
ting songs about menial subjects 
like coffee, toilet humor and girls. 

The initial rumor about the pio-
neer punk band reuniting seemed 
farfetched enough to have been 
made up by a hardcore Descendents , 
fan , irritated with the recent 
onslaught of teenagers picking up 
on the band's early material. 

Some fans went so far as to 
worry that even if the Descendents 
had reunited, they would probably 
sound exactly like ALL, the disap-
pointing band that continued from 
the De cendents after vocalist Milo 
left to pursue his Ph.D. 

Thankfu ll y, Everthing Slicks 
picks up from exaclly where Ihe 
Descendents left oil in 1987. The 
album's fifleen tracks adhere to the 
band 's previous recipe for success. 
Each song is driven by the band's 
explosive guitar, fast drummi ng and 
melodic singing, with the occasion-
al primal scream where nccessary. 

The only clement of Everything 
SLIcks that departs from the Descen-
dents of the '80s is Ihe loss of the 
band's'commonality. On the 

Descendents' earlier albums, the 
Iyries catered to the lifestyles of its 
fans. Everything Sucks fails to speak 
to the fan or rouse emotions. 

Ahhough the album fai ls to 
match the standards of earlier mate-
rial, it exceeds any releases from the 
current pop-punk genre. 

Kala 
Kaia 

-**** 

~erry Key 

Some define Kaia as a folk 
singer, while others categori~ her 
music as pop. 

However. twenty-two-year-old 
Kaia Wilson and her melodies delve 
beyond such labels to bring us sin-
cere songs of strength and heart-
break - backed only by her eamest 
voice and strumming gui tar. 

Previously the singer and gui-
tarisl of the girl-powered Portland 
band Team Dresch, Kaia rocked her 
electric gui tar ferociously -
denouncing Christianity, rape, anti -
gay violence and television, while 
praising teen crushes and girl love. 

On her first se lf-titled so lo 
album, Kaia has toned her style 
down, and made the personal politi -
cal. ln the majority of her tunes, 
Kaia asserts her independence and 
self-respect found th rough soul -

1lIe cardigans 
First Band on the Moon 

...... " Rtc0r4. 

-
*** 

The Cardigans' third full -length 
album, First Balld all the Moon, 
experiments with various '60s and 
'70 musical movements while et 
against a backdrop of ki tsch-pop. 

In its latest release, the Swedish 
band departs from its beatnik jazz-
inlluenced style fo r a quirkier, more 
experimental pop sound. 

Le.1d singer ina Persson carries 
over the album wi th her ethcreal 
voice. However. the addil ion of 
such musical movements as psyche-
delic and disco mar the childl ike 
quality of her vocals. 

While the Cardigans remain con-
sistent in their bold and styli tic 
experi mentation, the band fails to 
retain the polished. upli ft ing tone of 
their last alhum.

On their third release, The Cur-
tain Hits the Cast, Low places the 
sorrows of life in a wistful light of 
hope and possibility, evoking vol-
umes of feeling from a minimal col-
lection of notes and words. 

Beyond sparsely arranged 
melodies, Zak Sally's dwindling 
bass guides Alan Sparhawk's guitar 
in its wanderings through the kele-
tal framework of Mimi Parker's 
snare/cymbal drum combination. 

The scaled-down instrumentation 
creates a desolate, beautiful sort of 
music that - when coupled with the 
woefuily poignant lyrics - evoke 
simultaneous feelings of desperation 
and hope. 

Vocalists Sparhawk and Parker 
bare {heir emotions in a similarly 
simplistic and beautiful tyle. The 
lyrics construct images of desire - a 
desire for change, escape and to 
regain what is both lost and unattain-
able. 

One of the album's best tracks, 
"00 You Know How to Waltz?," is a 
fourteen-minute ethereal drone rem-
iniscent of Labradford or one of Fly-
ing Saucer Allack's quieter 
moments. 

While the song is almost devoid 
of any real melody and only a spat-
tering of lyrics, it manages to convey 
its message. 

The Curtai/l Hitl' the Cast marks 
Low's finest release yet, and a per-
fect starting polOl for those who 

have not been turned on to the one 
band that makes melancholy an 
attractive stale of mind. 

Low will pcrfonn at the Casbah 
on Friday at 9 p.m.

What Would 1M ...

On Catpower's second full-
length release, What Would the 
Community Think, a glorious inti-
macy permeates as lead singer 
Chan Marshall draws the audience 
into her world of distorted thought. 

Marshall's disarming vocals 
guide the listener through simple 
musical accompaniment. Tim Foli-
jahn is as consistent on guitar as 
Steve Shelley (of Sonic Youth) is 
subdued on drums. 

. The album's folk quality -
which can be allributed to Mar-
shall's southern roots is reflected in 
the song "They Tell' Me." The 
track 's guitar riff maintains a blues 
influence, which accentuates Mar-
shall 's woeful lyrics. 

While Marshall is comparable 
to raucous female singers from 
bands such as Concrete Blonde and 
Sonic Youth, her approach is more 
soulful, as she retains complete 
control over the music. 

Cat power will continue to pro-
duce a murky, sultry sound. so long 
as Marshall lead the band's disillu-
sioned soul. Catpower will perform 
attlTe Che Cafe Saturday at 9 p.m.

The Jabbe~aw coffeehouse and 
an gallery, located in L.A.'s seedy 
Crenshaw District, is renowned for 
booking only the hippest and ultra-
a1temati ve sounds of the under-
ground. These acts are showcased 
on Jabberjaw 's second compi lation 
albuOl entitled Pure, Sweet Hell. 

The album features tracks from 
bands who have performed at the 
club. Jawbreaker's contribution, 
"Sister," may be the last song 
recorded by the now-defunct band. 
The album also features experimen-
tal surf-rock bands, including the 
Bomboras, the Hi.Fives. and Man 
or Astro-man? Other tracks include 
punk anthems from Fill of Depres-
sion and Clikatat IkalOwi. 

Some of the album's most inter-
esting tnlcks include Everclear's 
cover of the Smiths' "How Soon IS 
Now?" and Low's cover of the Bee 
Gees' "I Started a Joke." 

Profits from the album go direct-
ly to assisting Jabberjaw's long-
awaited relocation.

BIG NIGHT: 
Shalhoub heads for 
the kitchen 
c.tt .... from .... 1.0 
on "Life Less Ordinary," a film 
directed by Daniel Boyle, the 
director of ''Trainspolting.'' The 
movie also stars Ewin McGregor, 
of ''Trainspolling,'' Tucci and 
Cameron Diaz. 
a ...... : DId you ..... to 
cook for the movie? 

Shalhoub: We had to cook the 
dishes for the movie, while we 
were actually on the screen using 
the stoves. 

Stanley and I actually trained 
at the Culinary Institute in Los 
Angeles, and I cook much better 
now. 

How was this work differ-
ant from your other pr0-
jects? 

. This is the largest part I've 
done in a film before, and it was 
great because I knew the direc-
tors, so there was a very tight-knit 
feeling to it. 

It didn ' t feel too strange work-
ing with such high-profile lars 
because I've worked with many 
before. I've worked with John 
TurturrQ and Joe Mantegna and 
many Olhers. 

I'm not star-struck so easily, 
although this time around it was 
amazing working with a woman 
like Isabella Rossellini , just 
because she is so beautiful and 
amazi ng. 
Do you .eeI like you're 
typeca5ted as an immi-
p'ant?

ly typecasted as an Italian immi-

Thursday, OcIOber 3, 1996 

........ it just 10 happenI that the 
more hilh-ProfiJe work I've done 
are as Antonio, in "Wings" and in 
this film. 
Could you ....... to any of 
Prtmo'. experiences? 

Yes. I have three brothers, so 
that helpe4 me relate to this role. 
I'm Lebanese-American. My 
father was born in Lebanon and 
my mother was born here, so I 
guess I'm first-generation . 

The experience growing up in 
my household was simi lar to 
Stanley 'S childhood growing up 
in an Italian household, where 
food played a very important role. 
How wu it .. fIminc the 
actual party scene? 

The party scene took over 
three weeks to .film. We didn' t 
cook all the food, fortunately -
there was a food stylist on the set 
cooking the food that was eaten 
- but again , we cooked the food 
on the stove. 
What was the message 
being delivered in the last 
scene of the film, when 
the brothers reach a mutu-
al undentandina of their 
differences? 

The last scene of the film was 
meant to be ambiguous. J think 
that the movie audience is trying 
to see what it's about. 

T really think that the point of 
the last scene was not so much 
about the survival of the restau-
rant as it was about the survival of 
the brothers ' relationship, that 
their love for each other and rela-
tionship remains intact. It 's not an 
important issue, whether they are 
separated or not, but that their 
mutual respect and identities 
remain intact.

CURDLED: 
Actress describes 
role in new 'film 
Continued from .... e 10 
Miami. 
What wa. QIaItIn Taranti-
no'. role in the project? 

Braddock: He was ' executive 
producer, which basically means 
he's sort of our godfather. He looks 
out for us, and he arranged for 
Miramu to finance Ihe film . He 
has a "first-look" kind of deal with 
Miramax. 

He helped us with the casting, 
because he knows of an incredible 
amount of actors that you forget 
about, but who are really great - a 
lot of B-movie actors that are real-
ly cool. He also helped with the 
script a bit, more conceptually than 
anything else. He thought that we 
should keep the script very simple, 
like an expanded version of the 
short film, and not complicate it up 
with a lot of extra characters and 
plot developments . 

During the editing process, he 
screened the film and would come 
in with his notes and talk to us and 
pend some lime with it, working 

on the final cut. 
Was your role in "Pulp Fic-
tion" <Esmeralda, the taxi 
driver) the same character 
as Gabriela? 

Jones: Yes. Tarantino based it 
on Gabriela, after seeing the short 
version of "Curdled ." He was 
writing "Pulp Fiction" at the same 
time and wrote me into the film 
after seeing "Curdled." I was 
incredibly lucky. And when I first 
went to L.A. , he told me about it 
and it was a big secret because he 
wasn't sure if it would go through. 
Basically, it was the same charac-
ter as Gabriela from the short that 
Bruce Willis ' character is stuck in 
the taxi with. But I think 
Gabriela's character changed a 101 
since then . 
How has Gabriela's charac· 
ter changed since the short· 
er version? 

Jo~: She comes from a dif-
ferent place in the short. In the 
short, she 's been working in the 
post-forensic service for a while, 
and in the feature she comes from 
a more innocent place. It was 
Reb 's idea, to brin~ in the whole 
fairy tale element and the curious, 
wide-eyed IiUle girl. element (0 
this Gabriela. 
What drives Gabriela's 
curiosity about death and 
serial killen? 

Jones: ] think it's a subject that 
nobody talks about, and so she 
wants to find out, and because 
nobody can really tell her all the 
information she wants to find out, 
and books don't tell you enough. 
The only way for her to find out is 
to ask the ki lIer orthe victi m them-
selves. 

Braddock: For e1tample, with 
Gabriela, the fairy tale about heads 
continuing to talk after being cut 
off is the ultimate e1tpression of 
what she' curious about - if you 
could talk to the killer, or if you 
could talk to the victim and they 
could talk back to you after the 
crime and tell you how they feel. [f 
the head could still talk, it has to be 
aware of its own demise and the 
ultimate fear, so its kind of like the 
curiosity she has. She's just kind of 
e1tploring this thing. The old fairy 
tales were written to explore the 
unknown and deaIh and the mon-
sters in the woods and all of that 
sort of thing, and 10 it's kind of the 
same idea.

" I love playing on this team," 
Nunez said. "It's a real team and we 
all play well with each other. We 
know that we can win all the rest of 
our games, and we are going to win 
nationals this year - I know it." 

As the second half began, UCSO 
looked to put the Regals away, and 
did not waste any time, scoring once 
agai n al the 50:54 mark when Lauren 
assisted on another Nunezgoal- this 
time her first shot was rejecled by the 
cross bar, but Nunez stayed with the 
play and buried her own rebound for 
a comfortable 2-0 lead. 

Wemmer. who had been beating 
her defender all night long. did not 
waste any lime scoring the Tritons' 
next goal. Only 57 seconds after 
Nunez's goal, the neet-footed for· 
ward scored her fir t of two goals on 
the night following her own shot off 
the cross bar, upping the score to 3-0. 

"If you beallthe defender) once, they 
get down," Wemmer said. "But in the 
first half they got me pretty good too. It 
look me a while to get going again." 

UCSO's domination was evident 
on the stat sheet, as Cal Lutheran was 
outshot 13-2. The Tritons also used 
eight comer kicks 10 generate scoring 
opportunities, while the Regals hit 
from the comer nags only once. 

At 64:49 and 65:59 Nunez and 
Wemmer scored again, respectively, 
notching UCSO lourthand fifth goals.

Appealing to a 
Lower Power 

Flash hack to the beginning 
of April, 1996: Bruce Boehy, 
trusted overseer of the San 
Diego Padres, had but one 

, dream, one thought - his heart 
was set not just on winning the 
National League West, mind you 
- nay, he wanted all the 
marble . A World Series 
Championship. 

Perhaps he wanted it too 
badly. He was afraid that hi s 
t~ - chock-full of cast-off -
would need divine intervention 
to achieve the goal. 

There was only one 'ure way 
of making his dream a reality , 
but it made him hudder just to 
think about it : He would have to 
make a pact with the devil. 

So Boehy summoned the 
arch-fiend up from the 
netherworld so they could 
negotiate. Bruce was convinced 
thi was the thmg to do. Alter 
all, what good was a soul 
without a World Series nng? 

"Tell you what I'll do, 
Bruce," the devil told him. 
"Normally I don ' t make pacts 
like this, but lor you. I'll make 
an exception. Your soul..Jor the 
championship. Just follow these 
instructions ... II 

The devil proceeded to 
carefully instruct Boeh on what 
he had to do to ensure a title.

Nunez Plays 
Regal Trick 
Toni, Tony, Tonie: Transfer from Loyola (Ill.) 
scored a hat trick in a 5-0 whipping of Cal Lu. 
By Sean Rahlml 
Sports Editor 

When it rains, it pours. At least 
when the subject at hand is scoring 
goals. And the UCSD women 's soc-
cer team has a habit of pUlling the 
round sphere into the back of the net at 
a prodigious rate. 

Take Monday night's con-
test against Cal Lutheran. The 
Tritons scored four goal~ in the 
second half en route to a 5-0 
demolishing of the Regals, im-
proving their record to 7-1. 

CSD was still smarting 
from its first defeat of the sea-
on after dropping a contest, 2-
I, to Division II Cal State Dominguez 
Hills last Wednesday night, and tbe 

al Lutheran game could not have 
been a better opportunity to get back 
on the winning column for Triton 

game," McManus said. "We needed 
to get back to our winning ways." 

On this cool night, the Triton of-
fensive machine kicked it into over-
drive, hounding the Regal defensive 
from the get-go. Controlling the ball 
for most of the first half. the midfield 

line of Toni Nunez, Brandie 
Hayungs. Kelly Kramer and 
Shelbi Thiele kept the ball on 
the Regal side of the field . 
Nunez and company felt 
obliged to share the ball, end-
ing their fellow teammates on 
runs down the sidelines. 

Chri ta Wemmer and Ele 
Johnson were the recipients of 

these passes, taking the ball into the 
heart of the Regal defense and setting 
up scoring opportunities. 

Aftertoo many scoring chances to 
recount, UCSD finally lit up the 

scoreboard with

Per Satan's advice, Bochy 
meticulously studied old tapes of 
the great managers in action: 
Marlin, Weaver, McGraw, 
Durocher. He desperately 
wanted to unearth some edge, 
some minute advantage that he 
could gain over his fellow field 
generals. He emulated them as 
best he could.

keeper Amy Walz 

Heads Up: Christa Wemmer (4) notched two goals in the 5-0 win. 

Ea¢h evenmg before retiring 
for the' night, he burned a 
magical incense Satan had given 
him. Bochy believed that the 
incense possessed medicinal 
properties that inexplicably 
enhancred intUition and karma. It 
made him feel kind of queasy -
he felt lighter than air - but he 
didn't care. Anything to put the 
Padre on top. 

He made his pitching staff 
visit an elderly soothsayer each 
week to have their palms read. 
He relied on an astrologer's sage 
advice when it came to selecting 
his pitching rotation. 

And whenever the Padres 
needed extra help, it came from 
below, as Satan would enable 
that occasional ninth-inning fly 
ball to sail over the wall for a 
game-winning horne run. 

After clinching the N.L. 
West title, Boehy called Satan 
once more to make sure the deal

TURNER POWER: With an overtime goal, Brian Turner extended UCSD's 
winning streak to eight, defeating Cal Lutheran, 2-1 , in the process. 

By Nicole V ...... 
Co-Assoclate Sports Editor 

History almost repeated itself la~t 
Monday when the Tritons snapped a 

I-I Lie to defeat Cal 
Lutheran 2-1. leav-
ing players recalling 
last year's 2-2 Lie with 
the Kingsmen. 

"We were expect-
ing(CaI Lutheran) to 
be tough because we 
knew this game 
meant a lotto them," 

sweeper Joel Kosakoff said. 'They 
played really, really well." 

However, leave it to UCSD to pull 
off its eighth consecutive win, beating 
Cal's Kingsmen, 2-1, in overtime and 

improving their record to 8-2. 
At the start of the game, both the 

Tritons and the Kingsmen ran onto 
the field with fire in their eyes and an 
incredible determination to win. No 

mat~er how many shots each learn 
took toward the goal, neither squad 
was coring anything but a yellow 
cant. 

That is until a purple-clad Cal Lu 
player put a comer kick past UCSD 
goalkeeper Jason Reynoso. giving the 
Kingsmen the early lead, 1-0. 

"We had a lot of chances," 
Kosakoff said, "and we could have 
scored like three or four goals in the 
first half. That was like an adrenaline 
rush for (Cal Lutheran)." 

In spite of the Kingsmen' s adrena-

line and a number of unlucky shots for 
UCSD. the Tritons weren't finished 
yet. 

As the first half neared a close, 
midfielder Brian Turner made a long 
throw in from the sideline to Chris 
Fong, who "headed" theassislloJose 
Ocampo. tying the game at I-I . 

Both UCSD and Cal Lutheran re-
sumed their tie-breaking attempts in 
the second half, but to no avail. The 
score remained I- I, and overtime be-
gan. 

The competition remained close 
until Brian Turner shot the ball off 
one unhappy Kingsrnen for the game-
winning goal, sealing the victory and 
keeping the eight-game streak alive
