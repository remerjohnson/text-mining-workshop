Julta had been a partiCipant In

study the way in which people 
react to the death of a spou e. "We 
were looking at their experience 
along a number of different 

ldimensions , from the inillal emotional and mental expenences 
to the ways that people cope with 
their losses," said Shuchter.

The project followed tw(nty-five

Ten juveniles have died in its care. 
It has caused a public furor in the 

West. Controversy and investigations 
have followed it nearly everywhere . 

If VislOnQuest IS such a good 
program, the critiCS ask , then: 

Why have 10 youngsters died in the 
last SIX years under VlslonQuest's care, 
seven of those m one boating aCCident? 

Why have there been complaints that 
Juveniles in the highly confrontational 
program have been physi ally abused? 

Why have outSide studies failed 10 
confirm VlslOnQuest's assertion that II 
turns well over half of the youngster m 
ItS care away from cnme? In fact. some 
studies mdlCate that a majority of 
VislonQuest' youngsters - who are 
treated m the program at a cost of . 97 a 
day, or about ~35 ,OOO a year - arc 
rearrested after their release.

in his belief that the underlying 
prob lem is "there's Just not enough 
factflues on campus." Fortunately, 
Ihe UCSD admlllistmtiun has been 
s(udYlIlg this problem and is

However, .IS ChJlrman of the

When this project was presented 
to the faculty , it felt that give n the 
great demands on our spaces, the 
depal1ment could allow students 
access only when they received 
fac ulty sponsorship , in other 
words when th ey demonstra ted 
the a ademic need for the space . I

Public speeches and mUSical

Shuchter. Also. there IS .l

But while Widows and Widower, 

then try to StdY dW.l}· lrom

different thll1gs they'd have to

huchter said .

unwlllingness to dccept the death . 
'We found that people go through 
an early phasc of shock and 
d Isbeltef. .. thal might la t mmutes 
to hours or days and even weeks," 
said huchter. 

After thiS early response to the 
trauma, any number of things may 
occur. Shuchter was unable to find 
any definite pattem to des nbc a 
person's response [0 thc situation. 
There are, however, several aspects 
to the gnevmg process that are 
common. Often the reality of the

Dr. Shuc hter has nncluded that 

an Important way people cope 
with thc 10 s of a loved one IS to 
dctually continue the relationship. 
"One of the realities is that people 
who had been together for twenty 
years, stay together in J way," he 
said "To a degree tha t relations hip 
continues In J modifIed form ." 

There Jre several wa),s In whIch 
thiS I .lccompli heel. "In thc ca rl}' 
phases, there IS a very common 
expenence of the survivor to feel 
the I eT"l)n who ha died as being 
stili alive. It could be through an}' of 
the senses. Most commonly, 
people feel the presence of their

But \\'ouldn t h.1I1glng on to the 
mcmoTle-; 01 .I de,ld person CJuse 
problems when returntng to a 
normal lifd "The common notion 
that people have whlle wlJrklng

rel,1[l0nshlp uoes not necessarily 
mean non-Involvement With other 
people . Somewhat surpn~lngly, 25 
percent of the people studied were 
dating within three months of the 
death . huchterexplained that this 
"Just ,lttestS to the fact that we , as 
human beings, have the capacity to

InteraCllons with others Although 
the spouse remained Impon,mt to 
them, eventually the relationship 
with the deceased tumed into

occurs the husb,md or Wife has 
more trouble adJustlllg to cvelyday

Golf team ranked second 

Grudges abound 
at Nationals 
By GUSTAVO SANTOYO 

When C.1I-~tJ[e ' tamslJus and UCSD hit rhe golf courses of 
Mansfield , OhiO for the DIVISion III Nationals, don 't expect the 
teams ro exchange plea'"mtrles 

As .1 m.lUer of fJct , don 't be surpnsed If the twO teams e,'(change 
punche, 

Cal State Stanislaus and UCSD finished one-two In last year's 
,Itlonal , and they C,lrry the same position gOing mto thiS year's 

Natlonals UCSD coach MIke Wydra, acknowledges that the 
Tmons rivalry IS JUSt a shade short 01 blttcr 

"I won 't say we holte them ," said Wydra , "Ie t '~ JUSt say we have a 
healthy dl Ilke or them .. 

The distaste between the twO teams developed rrom allegations 
that Stalllsiaus was paymg recruits [0 attend the school. 

"Stantslaus gives mOlley [0 its players," said Wydra . "It's aU unda 
the table , but they do It." 

A cordtng to Wydra, the golfers he was trytng [0 recruit [0 UCSD 
seemed to want more than a chance to attend the ulllversity. "They 
would ask me, 'How much money will you give?' I would tell them 
we do nOt give out scholarships, and then they would say, 
Stantslaus is offering them so much mone}' to attend n 

Wydra went on to explatn thatall the money given to the golferts 
hidden und er the mle of "rtna nclal ard ." 

AU this has tntensifled what IS alreadya heated nvalry which has 
sc:n the Tnrons come up short of winn ing the atlonal title . 

We are playmg reaUy well nght now goi ng into Nationals. Pat 
Welshan and Joost Steenkamer are on top of their game nght now, 
and I feel confident we 'll be there tn the end," 

The volatile Wetshan will be tnvolved in a grudge match with 
Enc Meerbeck,last year's Division III National champIOn who won 
the utiI.' after controversial dlVIStOn on the 17th hole of the final 
round 

Meerbeck ground hiS pUller behInd the baU and the ball moved 
Without being touched. Rules state that It should have counted as a 
stroke , but Meerbeck denied aU accusations. 

"He wtll be ~ound~y despised J[ the atlOn"ls,' aid Wydra. "Golf 
IS a gentlemen 5 game and there are no referees like In Other SpOrt . 
You rely on the honesty 01 people to poltce It. He was less than 
truthful " 

The Tnrons .Ire 10-2-2 overall Jnd of-I-2 agatnst DI\'1510n III

~gardless of whether they make it to the pl~rI's 01' not. DAMM demonsuates

sorely lacking. These guys are sudl a furl-loving, Bud Ugtlt drinking bunch that 
even your g:>od 01' bu~ Spuds used to pl~ Ibr them when he was in his primel 

Do you enjoy b ig, greasy 
East Coast guinea-r ck fro m 
hell! Do you enjoy UWF 
Wresting, Genesee Cream 
Ale , Mike Tyson , Living Dead 
movies, and members of the 
opposite sex? Stay tuned cause 
I have something to make you 
feel right at home. The Jacks. 
They're not for wimps, 
conservatives, or other easily 
offended crybabies; if you're 
one o f those types you can go 
do something else. Only the 
truly adventurous need 
continue. 

If you take Dion, The Four 
easons, The Young Rascals, 

and a heavy dose of M oto wn , 
filter it all down through 15 
years of advancemt:nt, you 
might begin to get an idea of 
what I'm talking about. The 
Jacks have a ra re talent which 
enables them to blend their 
influences into a fresh, 
cohesive sound while still 
retaining that wild, reckless 
nature that used to make 
" Rock 'n Ro ll " so special. 
They're a unique, spirited lot 
of boys that despite their years 
seem to have never really 
calmed down. 

The leader of the group is 
Buddy Blue . If you recognize 
the name, it may be from his 
previous association with The 
Beat Farmers. The bassist, 
Chris Sullivan was with The 
Penetrat ors until th e ir 
mys te rious demise . Jac k 
DiMattia, by fa r the o ldest 
member of the group and 
drummer, has been into far 
mo re than he could ever 
remember. no~ the least of 
which was playing in the 
o riginal Iron Buw .. ·rfly. Mighty 
JOt' Longa, organist and cook 

ts a much disputed history . me say he was a "Rock 'n 011" prostltU'f. SOme say 

Jacks in tne music trade 
he's a world famo us boxing 
champio n ' gone undercover. 
Some people suspect he might 
even be alien . No one knows 
for sure, but women still 
continue to send him photos 
of themselves naked . 

The Jacks have a raw, animal

Are)Ou nor proud of what you

We should be proud because

-Limbo Slam 

"What we are is a cross-
cultural band that is easily 
accessible to a majority of 
audiences," expressed 
Mark Dycai co . lead 
vocalist / bassist for the San 
Diego-based Limbo Slam. 
"Calypso, J'eggae, bosano-
va, and recently jazz - all of 
our music has a hint of 
those styles," Dycaico 
explained. " We 're trying to

ideas." Limbo Slam presents 
original "Latin-influenced 
dance rock" at the Spirit 
Club tomorrow night, May 
8. 

The band also consists of 
guitarist Bernard Yin, 
drummer Bob Taylor , 
Tony Sarain on saxophone, 
flute and percussion, and 
Bob Conrad on trumpet 
and percussion. Previously 
members of a former local 
group called the Flaming 
Hibachis, Dyca ico and Yin 
resurrected a band during 
the summer Qf 1984 with a 
drummer and saxophonist. 
The band set out to play 
dance music that they used 
to term "tropical punk ." 
When asked what kind of 
dl&'n l'ng ' aC(;'O'l'np'llni d ~ 

"tropical punk," Yin came 
up with the name Limbo 
Slam. 

When Limbo Slam began 
three years ago, Dycaico 
had just graduated from 
UCSD. flI was really 
confused," he recalled . " I 
knew I wanted to start the 
band and I knew I wanted 
to get a job." But, like most 
local musicians, he faced 
the situation of needing to 
" pay bills and buy 
equipment" while pursuing 
the interests of a band . He 
is c urrently following 
through on his degree in 
animal physiology, work-
ing as a resea rch technician 
at Scripps Clinic.

and grab o ne o f the neareSl

like a wild excess. it sho uld . 
Thejacks ' fans are n:kno wned 
throughout the outhwest for 
their casual attitudes and 
hefty bar tabs. Being o ne of 
the few original bands in San 
Diego that can consis tently 
pack local clubs to the gills, 
Thdl.4:ks take particular p ride 
10 their fan club, " The Jacks 
are my Pals." for no a nnual 
fee, the members receive an 
assortment of bumper 
stickers, calendars, newslet-
ters and chances to enter cool 
contests. This is one band that 
definitely gives its fans their 
money's worth . 

In a town full of Gumbys , 
The Jacks are Popeye. They're 
Michael Tyson, Bruce Willis, 
and W ebster all rolled up into 
o ne. They're a fast ride early 
in the morning in the bad part 
of town with your eyes closed. 
Does this sound li ke your type

Restaurant Review 
Surf's up! 

"Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world," 
sang the Beach Boys, Or, you might be sitting down to 
dlOner at the Kona Grill and Bar in Solana Beach. 

Owner Rick Melvin, dressed in a Hawaiian shi rt and 
jeans, greets people himself at the entrance to his 
restaurant ~.i th the c<:,~stal ambience. Sur fboards hang 
from the cetllOg. Hawallan music p lays in the background. 
An electric blue neon wave lights up over the ba r. 

After being in the restaurant business in other places for 
15 years, native San Diegan Melvin decided "it was time 
to come home." So he set up the Kona in March 1985 as 
"an idea for a small restaurant that would cater to the local 
people in a real beach atmosphere." 

The Kona serves distinctly-flavored seafood and steaks 
grilled over oakwo d. pecialties here include the Kana 
Luau - a seven-ounce portion of fresh fish cooked in 
onion dnd butter, served with salad and rice - and 
Alaskan halibut - top-broiled in butter and vermouth 
larger than local halibut. The Kona Mai Tais are als~ 
noteworthy. 

Melvin wants people who come to the restaurant for the 
first ~ime to feel "that they had a good meal at a fair price, 
that It was comfortable, [and] that the service was friendly 
and efficient." This is definitely accomplished, noting the 
many people who return to the Kona - from families to 
collegiates, fro m rowdy tables of eight to intimate tables 
of two. The Kona "i just trying to fit into the community 
and make people feel at home." 

Open daily, the Kana Grill a nd Bar is located at 731 
outh Highway 101, right pa t the intersecti n of Via de 

la Valle. CalJ 481-1860 for reservations.

A 
com.edic 

• evenIng 
. by david forman 
Tuesday night at the Pub, 

UEO presented a night of 
comedy, with two comedians 
Marc Gardner and Bruce 
" Babyman" Baum. To a 
omewhat small, but 

responsive c r wd, the two 
displayed their unique styles 
of comedy, and the result was 
generally successful and 
occassionally hilarious . 

Ga rdner opened the show 
with a omewhat standard 
routine, which was high-
lighted by an inspired set of 
jokes surrounding his wife's 
pregnancy, and the birth of 
their child . Joking about his 
large nose, he said that the 

doctor told him when his wife 
was giving birth that it was a 
boy, only to take hI intitial 
observation back . Other than 
a few rude job,s, Gardner's 
act was entL'rtaining. Another 
highlight of hi act was when 
he brought a computer 
Liencc major on stage (who 

shall remain nameless, but 
you know who you are), to 
add some background vOLals 
to a rap ong. 

Saum took the stage, and 
displayed a more outlandish 
sense of humor than Gardner. 
His act, complete with props 
and other visual gags, at times 
seemed like a take off of 
anolher comedian, Gallagher, 
but o ther times hi act was 
decisively Bruce Baum. Early 
in his act hc expressed his love 
for animal s. "I've been 
arre ted for it twice," he 
began "but never convicted." 

Hi act ranged from sixties 
drug humor to a hilarious 

Imitation of an introduction 
to a Brucc Spring teen s ng . 
Saum wa even prL'pared for a 
Joke failing, by reciting bad 
poetry if the audience didn't 
laugh. He conCe ed after the 
show, laughing "I don 't like 
doing that much poetry 
bpcau e it means that my act 
was had ." The device made 
even his weakest jokes funny. 
Saum 's encore wa a rendition 
of "Marty Feldman Eye ," a 
song from his album "Born to 
be Raised ." 

Baum's career tarted at 
UCLA, where he attended 
graduate school, and received 
a degree in film . He began 
working full time as a 
comedian after graduating 
from UCLA. 

H is ni ckname "Babyman" 
came from a charactcr that he 
invented for his stand up 
routmes. He IS now shooting a 
film which also stars George

fa r a what I want d to do 

career~wis ," Dycai added. 
"Now I've got my ense of 
direction. That i, I reall 
want to be a pr fe ional 
musician. " 

Dy aico noted how Limbo 
lam had progre sed over the 

years. " We've gone in the 
directi n of more original 
rather than covers. My 

songwnttng i a little m re 
omplex, and hopefully a little 

m re ophi ticated. There' a 
lot more per nality on 
stage." He enjoy seeing a 
steady f llowing of "dance~ 
oriented people" at their 
how . 

Recently, Limbo lam ha 
been "moving in the direction 
of Lo Angeles," playing at 

lub like Madame Wong ' 
We t and the FM tati n. 
Like ther local mu i ian, 
Dy ai 0 finds L Angele 

audien e "more re eptive to 
original mu i ." 

He ontinued, "There' a 
difference in attitude from 
ci ty to city towa rd the type of 
mu i people want to hear 
from live bands. an Diego i a 
tough audien e. Pe pie want 
to hear omething they've 
heard before, 0 it's very 
difficult for an original band 
to d anything significant." 

ycaico believe that San 
Diego will have a m re 
re pon ive I -al nw ic ene 

"when the quality of original 
musi - improve ," whi h he 
trives for with hi own 
ongwriting and performan~ 

ce as Limho Slam' lead

pushing it," Dy ca i co 
projected for the band, whi h 
is presently recordi ng an EP in 
Los Angele due for release 
this summer.

that. Without a doubt, it was 
well worth the price of
