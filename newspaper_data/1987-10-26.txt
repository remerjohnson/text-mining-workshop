UCSD ranks high in 
med school admissions 
By CHRIS HAMSON 

A larger percentage of UCSD graduates 
attend medical school than graduates of 
any other public school, a study recently 
documented. 

According to a study published by the 
National Association of Advisors for the 
Health Professions, 8.1 percent of UCSD 
graduates go to U.S. medical schools. The 
University of Virginia follows with 5.8 per· 
cent of its graduates going on to medical 
school. 

Although UCSD was first among public 
universities, some private coUeges had 
higher percentages. Johns Hopkins, with 
23.9 percent of graduates attending medi· 
cal school, topped the list. Stanford with 
15.1 percent, Harvard with 13.6 percent, 

Brown with 13.3 percent and Yale with 
12.7 percent followed. 

Besides UCSD, other schools in the UC 
system stood out with high percentages . 
UC Davis had 5.6 percent of graduates 
attending medical school while UCLA had 
3.7 percent and Berkeley had 3.2 percent. 

The figures represent the undergraduate 
educations of first year medical students 
for the years 1982-84 and were obtained 
from the Association of American Medical 
Colleges. 

According to chief pre·med advisor 
Nicole Moran, one reason why so many 
UCSD graduates go on to medical school 
is that many are interested in medicine and 
they are successful in pursuing that interest. 

Pre·med advising at UCSD is, accord-

UCSD fund raising brings in $32.6 million 
Officials at the University of 

California, San Diego yesterday 
announced that they have exceeded 
their goal in the largest fund-raisiing 
drive ever attempted at the cam· 
pus, rai.in. $32.6 miUion for new 
buildings and endowments. 

The drive, launched in September 
1985, wasdeaigned to raise $30.4 
million, most of which was ear· 
marked for new campus facilities 
that are not eligible for state money. 

Such projects include a univer· 
sity center and bookstore, a build· 
ing for the Institute for Research on 
Aging, a cancer facility, a faculty 
club and an aquarium museum, all 

of which will cost $20 million. 
The remaining $10.4 , million 

raised by the campign was for 
endowments so the univerity can 
recruit faculty members and grad-
uate students, build special library 
collection. needed for research, and 
establi.h a major campus and com· 
munity lecture program as well as 
enhance visiting scholar and artist· 
programs. 

"Weare deeply gratified at the 
community's response to our 
appeal," said UCSD Chancellor 
Richard C. Atkinson. "The. tar· 
geted projects were critically needed 
but could not be financed with state 

funding. 
"With such generous support 

from the community, UCSD will be 
in a much better position to sustain 
the excellence of our programs and 
facilities and to accommodate the 
rapid growth we're experiencing." 

The exact amount raised -
$32.588,628 - was celebrated at 
a banquet for major donors yes· 
terday. 

Major contributors included: Sol 
Price and his family, who donated 
$2 million for a new University 
Center, Florence Riford, who gave 
$1.6 million for endowed chairs in 

Alzheimer's disease and AIDS re-
search and a library collection on 
the Pacific Rim, Helen Hillyer, a 
$1.1 million bequest for medical 
school scholarships, Ida and Cecil 
Green, $1 million for a facuhy club. 

The Stephen and Mary Birch 
Foundation, headed Ly San Die· 
gans Patrick and Rose Patek, con· 
tributed $6 million for a new aqua· 
rium and ocean science center at 
Scripps Institution of Oceanog· 

raphy. Other foundations contrib· 
uted another $3 million. 

Local corporations gave $1.5 
million: UCSD faculty and staff 

members contributed $2.6 million; 
alumni, students and parents gave 
$2.3 million, and a variety of pri. 
vated resources accounted for $4 
million. 

The university said that even 
though it has reached its goal, it will 
continue to seek funds for special 
projects. 

"Such endowments are essential 
to the very mission of the univer· 
sity," Atkinson said. "They directly 
support our teaching, research and 
clinical programs and enable us to 

provi~e for the community the 
resources of a leading research 
university." (g

Pound seizure: an unreliable 
and unnecessary source 
for aniDlal research 
By CHRIS WALLER 

The passengers in the yellow 
truck that pulls up to the UCSD 
research facilities several times a 
week know nothing of the contro· 
versy surrounding them, or that they 
will never leave the facility alive. 

These passengers are former 
pets, bought from county animal 
shelters by UCSD for research. 
The contract authorizing this prac· 
tice - often called "pound seizure" 
- was approved by the County 
Board of Supervisors in 1967, and 
is currently the subject of much 
contro ersy. 

Animal.protection groups say 
that former pets should not be used 
for research, and that pound seiz· 
ure undermines an effective shelter 
system. UCSD spokespeople, of 
course, disagree. They repeatedly 
use the same mix of tired phrases in 
an attempt to justify the practice. 
But animal rights advocates have 
ready answers for their [justifi. 
cations] . 

"These aren' t pet s," the reo 
searchers say. 

Of course they're pets. Wild 
packs of feral dogs are not roaming 
the streets of San Diego, and reo 
searchers wouldn't want them if 
they were. They want healthy, 
calm, tractable animals - in other 
words, pets. Does an animal de· 
serve humane treatment only if it is 
a pet? 

Researchers also claim that "with 

the abolition of pound l>eizure, reo 
search will come to a screeching 
halt. " 

99.5 percent of UCSD research 
projects do not use pound animals 
and would not be affected in the 
slightest. Much of the research 
done at UCSO on pound animals is 
trivial, painful, and a waste of tax 
dollars . The experiences of the four 
foreign countries, 11 states and 52 
of 58 California counties that do 
not practice pound seizure show 
that vital research will continue and 
will not be affected. "But without a 
cheap source of research animals, 
our research will go bankrupt!" is 
another popular argument for con· 
tinuation of pound seizure. 

Less than one· tenth of one per· 
cent of UCSD's annual research 
budget goes to purchase pound 
animals. Seventy percent of tax 
money used for research at UCSO 
goes into the researchers' pockets 
as salary, and at least four times 
[the amount] spent on pound ani · 
mals is spent on trip ' by the reo 
searchers - paid for by tax dol· 
lars . Surely UCSD, one of the rich· 
est universities in the nation, can 
afford the small cost increase the 
abolition of pound seizure might 
entail. In fact, several research stu· 
dies have shown that pound animo 
als are actually the most expensive 
possible research model , due to 
their high mortality rates. 

"But they're going to die any· 

way!" This is the most common of 
arguments in our throw·away so· 
ciety - and the most callous. 
Terminally ill patients are also 
"going to die anyway" - does this 
justify using them for research? It is 
the quality of death that is impor. 
tant - a quick painless death in the 
pound versus the lingering suffer· 
ing of the research lab. Which 
would we choose for our pet, if he 
were lost and we could not find 
him? 

This also obscures a basic fact 
-pound animals are inappropriate 
for quality research . The National 
Institutes of Health, funder of most 
biomedical research in the U.S ., 
has not been able to produce even 
one example of a research project 
requiring pound animals as the 
only possible research model. 

Pound animals are used for reo 
search mainly due to tradition, 
cheapness, and convenience -
hardly good scientific reasons. Their 
medical and genetic backgrounds 
are totally unknown. This adds 
unknown variables to already·com. 
plex research problems and can 
make research results uninterpret. 
able . Researchers would not think 
of using rats or mice randomly 
taken from the city dump - why, 
then, is it appropriate to use dogs or 
cats randomly procured from the 
city streets? 

It has also been documented that 
pound animals taken to the lab 
experience an inordinate amount of

Some UCSO spokespeople have

Editor: 

Last Thursday a group of about 
90 people met with Gunnar Bir· 
kerts & Associates - the a rchitec. 
tural firm contracted to renovate 
Central Library to provide addi . 
tional reference , collections and 
staff work space . Noticeably under. 
represented at this open presenta· 
tion and discussion were students. I 
saw only one other. 

At issue are proposed modifica· 
tions to the building that has become 
the sole architectural masterpiece 
of our campus. Its having assumed 
the role of a striking and well rec · 
ognized icon of UCSD can hardly 
be disputed , and alterations to it 
deserve attention from all , includ· 
ing students. 

The committee charged with offi· 
cially electing a plan (choosing no 
plan is an option) will continue to 
meet for two weeks before making 
Its decision. During this period sen· 
timents must be expressed to the 
committee by students if they wish 
to influence UCSO's architectural 
and iconographic future. 

Models and schematic drawings 
will be on display at Central Library 
beginning Oct. 23. Letters should 
be addressed to the Chancellor,

UCSD men's soccer 
team chastised 
Editor: 

I noticed in Monday '~ a rticle 
about the Men 's soccer ga me 
again"t UC Sa nta Cruz last Satur· 

day that one minor incident was 
quietly omitted. That incident occur· 
red five minutes into the game 
when one of UCSD's playeu, com 
letely unprovok~ , ~mashed his 
elbow into the face of UC Santa 
Cruz's center halfback who was 
going up to head the ball. The half· 
bac k staggered for a moment and 
then collapsed onto the field . He 
was unconscious for almost five 
min tes. The paramedics were called 
and he was taken to Sharp Hospital 
where he underwent x·rays and a 
CAT scan. He suffered partial 
amnesia. 

Injuries happen in athletics but 
this kind of outright violence is 
deplorable. The player made no 
attempt to make amends or to call 
the hospital after the game to see if 
the player was all right. The coach 
was equally indifferent. He did not 
punish his player or check up on the 
injured player. The referee did not 
even call a foul. In my opinion a red 
card was in order. 

A player who feeb it necessary 
to take out the opposing team's 
best man obviously doesn't have 
the skill or mental toughness to win 
by the rules; and a coach who tol· 
erates this type of behavior doesn't 
belong in a position of authority . 
UCSD's team definitely doesn't 
belong in the playoffs.

Although UCSD has branded 
oppon nts of pound seizure as 
" liars" and some organizations 
against pound seizure as "fronts for 
lerronsts. " they themselves have 
repeatedly lied - perhaps most 
importantly by stating that all 
UCSD research is "open for inspec· 
tion at any time." This is farcical. 
Only one law - the federa l Animal 
Welfare Act (A W A) - covers 
animals in labs [but] it covers only 
animal quarters - Inspectors are 
forbidden to inspect actual research. 

There is no agency that inspects 
research facilities for humane treat· 
ment of the animals. Researchers 
may legally do anything they wish 
to any animal in their lab without 
fear of prosecution - they are 
exempt from all state and local 
anti-c ruelty laws . Incidentally , 
UCSD ha~ been fou nd to have 
severe deficiencies under the A W A.

For example. in 1985 UCSD was 
cited for operating on dogs in un· 
sterile conditions - conditions that 
could lead to infection, and in 
1986. for keeping dogs in kennels 
covered with their own feces. 

Another tacti c used by UCSD is 
to purposely cloud the issue by 
a ppealing to our fears of dea th and 
disease. They clai m that a ll those 
against pound seizure are" emotion· 
al anti-vivisectionalists who would 
end all animal research." This is, of 
course, not a rational argument for 
pound seizure, but an attempt to 
"smear" animal [rights) advocates. 
In reality , many researchers, doc· 
tors and vets oppose pound seiz· 
ure, and over 70 scientific articles 
have pointed out the shortcomings 
of the practice. 

Lastly , they point to medical 
advances supposedly made through 
the use of pound animals. As re-
searcher Van Critters Dean of Uni-
versity of Washington Medical 
School pointed out, these advances 

were made in spite of, not becau se 
of the use of pound animals in 
research. In a ll likelihood. we could 
have had Ihese result~ much fasler 
if quality research, instead of cheap 
research had been done. That thiS 
research wa s accomplished on 
pound animals, thus making them 
good research models, is no more 

. true than the facl that I can pound 
nails with a rock makes it the best 
tool for pounding nail s. 

UCSD's arguments are hollow 
rationalizations of an unnecessary 
a nd inhumane practice. Pound 
seizure undermines confidence in 
Ihe ~helter system - [a system 
meant to be] a last haven for lost 
pels, not a warehouse for cheap 
disposable research lools. The 
board of supervisors should vote 
for quality research and a quality 
shelter system. We can have both 
by ending Ihe pound seizure con-
tract. 

Chris Waller is from Ihe S.D. Co-
alilion to End Pound Seizure.

Farmers get by in Brazil 
LOS ANGELES - Researchers 

on a project in the University Re-
sea rc h Expeditions Program 
(UREO) are studying how share· 
croppers in impoverished north. 
eastern Brazil cope with the con-
stant threat of famine. 

The semi·arid sertoes (back-
lands) of the Northeast have been 
called the "drought polygon" be-
cause of Ihe unprediclable devas-
tating droughts that strike the area • 
wiping out crops and driving people 
from their home communities i~ 
search of food. 

Even when there is no act ual · 

illness or some other catastrophe 
prevents them from working Iheir 
parcels. 

But, as his neighbors are gener· 
ally as poor as he is, a sharecropper 
also expends considerable ingenuity 
in establishing friendly ties with his 
wealthier neighbors, such as local 
shopkeepers, small fa rmers and 
elite landlords who own the gianl 
fazenda s on which sha recroppers 
live and work. 

These ties have a feudalisti c 
aspect to them, for the share-
croppers promise loyalty and ser-
vice to their patrons, who in turn 

promise to take care of them in 
extreme need, when they have 
neither food nor money with which 
to care for their families. 
Although the sharecroppers feel 

some resentment about their pov· 
erty and dependence on elite, their 
more frequently expressed feeling 
conce rns how much they need the 
protection of the wealthy . For them , 
economic dependence is a source 
of security , and, since other sour-
ces are rare or a ltogelher lacking, it 
is one of the things in life most to be 
desired , Johnson said.

weather make food production in· 
herently insecure. 

How do tenant sharecroppers , 
who even in the best of times live 
near the margin of subsistance, 
adapt to such insecure circum· 
stances? 

Accroding to Allen Johnson, pro· 
fessor of anthropology at UCLA, 
and Carloll Soares, profelSor of 
anthroplogy at the U niversidade de 
Bahia in northeastern Brazil, the 
greater part of the sharecropper's 
economic life is devoted to finding 
sources of security in this threaten· 
ing en~·ironment. 

Their research, which spans 20 
years in the northeastern state of 
Ceara, focuses on the skills and 
knowledge used by the share-
croppers to "hedge their bets" in 
the fa ce of perennial risk. 

In the course of their research, 
they have developed a great respect 
for the thoughlfulness in planninig 
their households ' economic strat-
egies. 

They distinguished areas in the 
same field where soils, drainage, or 
other characteristics favor one crop 
over another, and plan their annual 
planting accordingly. 

Owing to the inherent risk of bad 
weather, they plant many different 
kinds of crops in different kinds of 
soil, to help insure that at least 
some crops will survive no matter 
what the weather. 

In this respect they behave very 
much like nervous investors who 
"diversify their portfolios" rather 
than putting aU their eggs in one 
basket. 

This i. no way to get rich quick, 
but it is a strategy geared to avoid 
being wiped out by some sudden 
llhilt in conditions. 

Sharecroppers work very hard 
at establi.hing and maintaining 
"good neighbor" (vizinho) relations 
with other sharecroppers. These 
ties of friendship may someday 
become necel&ary if their house· 
hold food supplies dwindle, or if

Fifth College administrators move in 
Lyon sets sail with Fifth 

ByGAYATRIGUNASEKARAN 

For most students currently en. 
rolled at UCSD, the decision to 
a ltend here was probably motivated 
by the noteworthy reputa tion of the 
school, a nd the nearby waves. 

T his year. however, some stu· 
dents, musing over their collegiate 
destinations, will consider the waves 
not only as a surfmg implement , 
but also as a passport to foreign 
cultures. Long established in the 
ports of San Diego, next year 
UCSD sets sail for the world via its 
newest addition - Fifth College. 

The focus of the college is an 
interna tional one, and its provost , 
Dr. James K. Lyon , is a man who 
strongly believes in the value of 
exposure to other cultures. 

Born in Holland , he learned 
Dutch before knowing English, and 
was in contact with people of many 
na tionalities . Lyon "assumed that 
everyone grew up meeting foreign 

visitors, and hearing different Ian· 
guages," and was surprised to learn 
that such was rarely the case. 

Lyon feels that his travels have 
served to give him a better under· 
standing of th is country, and a deep 
sense of a ppreciation for "the free· 
dom of opportunity a nd fertile soil 
that ex ist here for the promulgation 
of creative, imagina tive ideas." 

From his sojourn in Holland, and 
excursions to Germany, he con· 
cluded that people there were fa r 
more sensitive to the needs of their 
environment because there is grea· 
ter consciousness about such mat· 
ters. 

Lyon observed that the myriad 
of opportun ities whi ch provide 
Americans with such latitude also 
cause them to take education too 
lightly. 

In sculpting Fifth College , Dr. 
Lyon seeks to give the students the 
opportunities for growth and chal . 
lenge that come with the terrain of 

world studies. 
The goals of Fifth College are 

manifest in its curriculum, which 
consists of a world civilization 
course, a language requirement, 
and an area studies requirement, to 
name just a few. 

When discussing Fifth College, 
Dr. Lyon stressed that "people 
coming into Fifth College are going 
to be abl e to major in any subject , 
just like any UCSD student. We 
hope to a ttract more students in the 
social sciences and humanities than 
the other colleges , but we are not 
going to be a school for people 
majoring in international relations; 
our primary concern is to give stu · 
dents an international focus. We 
expect to have quite a large number 
of people with engineering science, 
natural science, and math majors. 
What we hope to create is an engi· 
neer , for example, with an interna. 
tional background.

Cultural life begins 
with Marsh 
By KAREN KUMM 
Senior Stall Writer 

Most of us have heard about Fifth College, perhaps even about the 
original plan fo~ 12 college.s at UCSD. Most people don't really realize, 
however, that Fifth College IS already open and getting ready for business. 

There are no students yet, but the administration moved into their office 
Sept. 1 and is hard at work planning for the new college. Dean Harriet 
Marsh, former dean of Warren College, has been so busy that her office is 
barelyunp~cked and s.he is still awaiting office furniture . The Fifth College 
administrative office IS located (perhaps only temporarily) across the 
street from Canyonview. 

Next fall marks the entrance of the first freshman class at Fifth College, 
the class of 1992. Approximately 400 students will be admitted . Their 

reside~ce halls wiU be the present Third College dorms, but will have been 
extenSIVely refurbished. Eventually, Fifth College will also acquire the new 
apartments tha t are being built adjacent to the Revelle apartments. There 
Will be no transfers admitted to the college until its second year. 

"We want the first class in to be the first class out ," Marsh said . "We 
want a really cohesive first year group." 

Marsh, a member 01 the UCSD administration since she became dean 
of Warren College in May of 1984 , joined a national pool of applicants lor 
the poslhon of Fifth College dean. She wa replaced at Warren by Denise 
CampbeU, former assistant dean. 

Prior to her arrival at UCSD, she was vice· president of student affairs at 
Adrian College in Michigan. She has held other positions as dean at other 
colleges in Missouri , Washington, and New York City. Marsh has also

Dower reaches history through art 
By WENDY FRANKISS 

Many of UCSD'. profellors seem to have been cUltom 
made to lit in with the philo.ophies and goals manifest in the 
upcoming illternationally·minded Filth College. No profes· 
lor, however, can fit in better than UCSD'I Dr. John Dower, 
who occupiel the Joaeph Nairnen endowed chair of history. 

Dower, with his diverse and eclectic sehola.tic back· 
ground, approaches his lubject matter Irom a number 01 
directions. Ahhough working on the luture structure 01 Filth 
College, Dower is concerned with conveying a broad under· 
standing 01 international relations in the present. 

Dower hal been teaching here since 1986. Having spent 
10 years in the department 01 history at the Univeflity 01 
Wisconsin, Madison, Dower decided that it was "time for a 
change and a challenge." Impressed by the growth of 
UCSD, along with a per5OlUl1 interett in Asia and the Pacific 
region, thi. univeraity with itt new Pacific Rim graduate 
.chool was an appealing place lor Dower to live and work. 
Perceiving a "sense 01 creative chaos here," Dower predicts 
that UCSD is not ali slrong at it will be in the non· western

international perspective. He sees opportunity as well as a 
need for growth in this area. 

Helping to make UCSD reach its potential as an 
internationally. aware university, Dower is currently work· 
ing on plans for Fifth College that involve emphasizing 
international.tudies. Working c10aely with Provost James 
K. Lyon, and jointly with Dr. Masao Myo&hi, a professor of 
comparative literature and Japaneae &tudies, he aims to 
produce a quality program. Dower sees this project, how· 
ever, as taking a "number of years" before it fully takes 
shape. 

Dower is preaently teaching History 180D - Pearl Har· 
bor and Hirolhima, subtitled World War II in Asia: Film, 
F antalY, and Fact. This courae reflects Dower's personal 
concern for the furthering of an academic emphasis on 
international relationl al well as his interest in the utilization 
of visual art. to explore history. 

This interest began for Dower through an attraction to the 
aesthetic and visual alpeeta 01 Japanese culture. Two 01 his 
books, "The Elements 01 Japanese Design: A Handbook of 

Family Crests, Heraldry, and Symbolism" and "A Century 
of Japanese Photography" are representative of this attrac-
tion. 

Dower's original attraction to Japan carne about when he 
was still an undergraduate in large part becauae Japan "was 
far away." In fael, he interrupted hi. education to live in 
Japan. (MOlt students can empathize with hil reason for this 
change: "I wal tired of school.") 

Interested in a career in joumaliwn, Dower began wor-
king al an aasistant editor in Tokyo, alter teaching En,Iiah 
for a year in the city of Kanazawa. On his return to the U.S., 
Dower completed his Ph.D at Harvard University. 

Dower'. interest in literature was instrumental in chang. 
ing the locus of his studies Irom Japaneae visual arts to a 
more generalized study of Japaneae culture. With the 
advent of the Vietnam War, this general interest became 
locused once again al Dower looked toward the subject of 
history as a way to understand the cauaes 01 culture 
clashes.

The Vietnam War stimulated 
Dower's concern for Asia and Ihe 
West. thereby raising difficult prob. 
lems as to U.S .·Asian relations in 
the context of war. "I've wrestled 
with the question of war and peace," 
Dower said. Such questioning has 
resulted in his desire to pass on his 
knowledge in this area to others. 

Dower's scholastic concerns are 
not purely with Japan: he feels it is 
necessary to place Japan in an 
international context since it 's 
impossible to understand a country 
without understanding how it inte· 
racts with the rest of the world. 

"J apan is not an island unto 
itself," he said. Hence the dynamo 
ics of understanding the modern 
world demand a larger perspective. 
Dr. Dower's own studies of Japan 
have lead to a broader context for 

history in a global and comparative 
sense. He offers constructive criti· 
cism lor America's ethno·centric 
Western attilude and its position in 
the world . He said this way of think· 
ing will cause Americans to "lose 
sight of ourselves." He added, "We 
don't understand ourselves; we 
don't have a comparative view." 

Dr. Dower has already discussed 
these sensitive issues in his most 
recent book, "War Without 
Mercy ," published in the spring of 
1986, in which he evaluates the 
presenl U.S.·Japanese relationship. 
This book looks at both sides of the 
respective cultures and is indicative 
of Dower's comparative approach 
to understanding international 
relations. 

"War Without Mercy" has reo 
ceived over 100 reviews and Dower 
is pleased by its fantastic response 
in the U.S . Indeed , in the U.S. edi· 
tion "War Without Mercy" has 
won the National Book Critic's Cir·

for the 1986 American Book 
Award . There is also a British edi· 
tion, and a Japanese translation is

Dr. Dower admits to having a 
fascination for memory , and since 
history is "in the memory business" 
he aims to recreate a memory of 
the past. Dower's dynamic sense of 
the past has utilized popular cui· 
ture, "not just formal documents ." 
Since people quickly forget the 
past , he has sought to reach a 
larger audience by way of graphic 
images, which are more likely to 
stick in peoples' minds than written 
work. 

The result of Dower's labor in 
this regard is his film " Hellfire." 
which has won a total of seven 
awards, including the Montreal 
Festival Award for Film on Art. 
The film depicts two Japanese

There is a sliU center of Eternity. A place where aU pasts, presents and futures meet. This intersecting point of knowledge and experience, pleasure and pain, mortality and immortality has been described and referred to in a variety of different ways by 
mystics, prophets and teachers who have experienced It. 

Some have described it as God or Heaven. Others have referred to it as ~iMna or Tao. 
In Zen it js caJJed Zen mind or EnJightenment. 

WhHe names, descriptions and methods for reaching the stiU center of being vary 
greatly, the uJtimate worth of this awareness is agreed upon by aU who have shared it. The 
experience of the sliU cenler of being brings freedom, self-control, balance and power to 
those who have attuned their Uves to it. 

Zen is tbe study of the Ten Thousand States of Mind and of Enlightenment, the still center 
which lies beyond the Ten Thousand States of Mind. II is a highJy personal study which brings 
clarity and purpose into the lives of those who practice it. 

Zen Buddhist thought has had a profound influence upon Chinese and Japanese history 
and culture. A great deaJ of the current success of the Japanese corporate mind stems from 
the effect of centuries of Zen practice in Japan. MartiaJ arts, dance, poetry, the tea ceremony 
and many other forms of personal, athletic and artistic expression have been gMD birth to by 
Zen mind. 

Zen is a highly refined and artistic approach to the meaning of Ufe. It isO't necessary to 
learn OrientaJ customs or to speak the Japanese language to successfully practice it. AU dw i& 
required is an open mind, patience, a good sense of humor and an intense desire for self-
improvement. 

I have written a free booklet about Zen for the "computer age" called "The 
Zen Experience.""" tn it I discuss Zen in more depth, and describe both contemporary and 
traditional methods I employ in teaching Zen at seminars and in private practice. 

If you would like to learn more about Zen and the wonders of your own mind, call 
or write for this free booklet today.

Marsh 
Continued from PAle 8 
been foreIgn stUdent advisor and 
director of student affairs of an 
International House. She received 
her bachelor's degree at the Uni· 
versity of Wisconsin, her malter'. 
degree at the New York Theologi· 
cal Seminary, and her doctorate in 
higher education at Columbia Uni· 
versity. 

"I would like to spend Ihe relit of 
my life in California," she lIBid. 
"I've saved the beat for last." 

With her background in interna-
tional relations, and extensive 
experience as dean, Marsh is very 
pleased with her new position. "This 
is the most exciting opportunity 
I've ever had," she said. "The 
[international] concept is most 
exciting, and the newness of the 
college is a challenge." 

The emphasis of Filth college 
will be internatio:lal studies, com· 
parative culture and foreign lan-
guage. The general education 
requirements will be focused .on 
comparative study of Western and 
non· Western cultures. Specific 
course requirements in Fifth Col· 
lege are still tentative, pending final 
Academic Senate approval. 

"What we're trying to do is to get 
people to think beyond the borders 
of this country," said Marsh. "I 
think students of filth College will 
have a genuinely global perspec-
tive." 

The planning committee for Fifth 
College, a group of UCSD academ· 
ics, met for several months to 
establi,h the initial plans for the col-
lege , Marsh said. The second 
planning committee is working on 
the actual curricular details of the 
college, ~hich will reflect the inter-
national emphasis in residential life 
and student activities. 

Specifically, Fifth will offer an 
Int ernational House, affi liated with 
the I nternational Center. Residents 
of the international apartment 
building will not only be Fifth Col· 
lege students, but also graduate 
students and students from other 
colleges. It is hoped that about half 
of the residents of the International 
House will be from forei gn coun-
tries or have studied abroad . 

Manh is unsure of when the new

Continued from page 8 

Fifth College encourages its stu· 
dents to spend some part of their 
lives abroad, in a non· tourist fashion 
because it aims to have its members 
experience another culture first· 
hand . Dr. Lyon and Ms. Barbara 
Blomgren, who is a management 
fellow at Fifth College, both agreed 
that the proceu of experiencing 
something different as opposed to 
something familiar creales the ne· 
cessary impact for widening .ome· 
one's perspective. Blomgren added, 
"The foreign language component 
that re.ult. from visiting a non· 
English speaking country enhances 
the culture shock just enough to be 
instructive. " 

Dr. Lyon hope. to expand the 
horizons of enthusiastic travelers 
and sheltered Californians alike, 
and to break away from Euro· 
centric thought. By bringing non· 
Western culture. into the range of 
students, he wanllatudents to rela· 
ize that "there are civilizations, cui· i 
tures, and modes of thinking that 
are ju.t as valid and meaninllful al 
our own." I n the world civilization ,

Although welt within the scope 
of most students' potential, Dr. 
Lyon i. the first to admit, "This 
program is definitely not for every· 
one. " 

"There are civilizations, 
cultures, and modes of 
thinking that are just as 
valid and meaningful 
as our own." 

-Provost Lyon 

For thoae who are having trouble 
distinguishing between Third Col· 
lege, and Fifth CoDege, Dr. Lyon 
offered some allistance. "In tenns 
of couraes we have as our center· 
piece something quite different than 
anything they have in their curricu-
lum. Our curricula wi! be disparate. 

"The focus [of Third College] 
seems to be on relatively recent, 
contemporary Third World occu· 
rences, whereas our focus hal a far 
more historical orientation. Third 
[CoOege] studies the intercultural 
components within this country: we 
won't be doing that. With our Ian· 
guage and area studies require· 
menu, and our emphasis on spend-
ing time abroad, we are trying to 
inslill a focus that is inlernational in 
its range and experience. Third 
seeks 10 have studenls appreciale 
the diversity and intercultural com-
ponenu that exist within the United 
States. 

"However, Third, Fifth, and all 
the colleges are similar in their 
equal commitment to undergradu-
ate education," Lyon said. 

"Fifth should inculcale a acmae of 
perspective and relativism in its 
students, which can be applied to 
life at UCSD in general. Great 
opportunities exist here for students 
to learn. Sure, UCSD has its faults, 
but it alllO has numerous advan· 
tages, and I happen to feel very 
poaitive about the advantages," he 
added. 

Soon, many wiD be reaping the 
benefiu of UCSD's latest advan· 
tage - Fifth College. It is, of 
course, the newest of UCSD's col· 
leges, but, in time, the students will 
consider il as integral a part of the 
university as any other college. 

For now, Dr. Lyon, and the I 
future students of Fifth College I 
prepare for voyage. to distantlandli. I

Men's soccer 
one step closer 
to playoffs 
3-0 victory keeps Tritons in the race 
By KURT BELL 
Stall Writer 

The thrill of .... 
On the ride to Claremont one 

thing was certain; a loss and the 
season would soon be over, a vic· 
tory welcomed post·season play. 

The topic was not an easy one 
for players to discuss; a season 
result was hours away. 

The result was, however, a pop. 
ular one - UCSD 3, ClaremontO. 
The fourth UCSD victory over 
arch· rival Claremont in a row and a 
tremendous leap toward UCSD's 
fifth playoff opportunity in as many 
years. 

UCSD, (though they had not yet 
known it) appeared to have the vic· 
tory .rom the moment they stepped 
out of the locker room. They met 
the field with fire in their eye, a task 
to be performed and one they 
executed. 

Fourteen minutes into the game 
the Tritons took some of the ten· 
sion away by taking the lead 1·0. 
Scott Goodman crossed a corner to 
Mike Bradley who chested the ball' 
to Carrick Brewster. Brewster 
touched it back to Craig Gross who 
rocketed a shot into the net's upper 
right corner. 

Twelve minutes later Bradley 
beat his man down the right field 
line and crossed the ball to Good· [~~:::::~~lJ~~~tJ".~l:}J! 
man's diving head for the second -.;;;-..;.; 
spectacular goal of the game. 

One minute after halftime, Dain 
DeForest put the game away with a 
header on another Goodman 

Coach Derek Armstrong : "We never let Claremont in the game. We psyched them out from the start. " 

corner. 
UCSD breezed the remainder of 

the game to a 3·0 win. 
From the kick·off the Tritons 

commanded the Stags. They won 
the fifty·fifty balls, controlled the 
midfield, and pressured the Clare· 
mont defense until they were out of 

the game. 
Claremont Coach Steve Davis 

admitted, "It should put UCSD in 
the playoffs . I think it is the best I've 
ever seen UCSD play . It means 
you (UCSD) have beaten us four 
times in a row, that's a statement." 

The performance was definitely 
one of UCSD' s best of the year, if 

not the best. There were contribu· 
tions from every part 0.- the team. 
Scott Rommel and Erik Dingwall 
pressured the wing" Brewster won 
headers at center forward, and 
Goodman, Bradley and Mike 
Kappes controlled the midfield. In· 
spired play by Gross, DeForest, 
Rod Cramblit, and Scott Hyver on 

defense, as well 81 outstanding 
playoff the bench helped the Trit· 
ona to victory. 

Why? "We had our backs a· 
gainst the wall," said Rommel, "we 
had to win."

Women's 
soccer 
wins2-1 
By MIKE FOLEY 
Stall Writer 

La~t Friday the UCSD women's 
soccer team did something it had 
never done before. Friday marked 
the lirst time the women's team ha~ 
ever beaten Division II Cal Poly 
Pomona. What makes the 2-1 Win 
even more impressive IS the fact 
that It was played on Pomona's 
home turf. 

The lirst half of Friday's game 
was fairly evenly played and ended 
in a 0-0 tie. 

Ten minutes into the ~eond half. 
UCSD was linally able to break the 
scoreless tie as Stephanie Savoy 
scored on a header off a corner 
kick. That goal only held up lor 
eight minutes when Pomona scored 
what coach Brian McManu; called 
a " highly disputable" goal to even 
the score }-1_ 

The Tritons did not leI the refe-
ree's call upset their concentration , 
and they continued to put pressure 
on Pomona's defense. Their con-
sistent efforts finally paid off a~ 
UCSD scored the winning goal 
with only 10 minutes left in the 
game. 

The Tritons did not let 
the referee's call upset 
their concentration, 
and they cont inued to 
put pressure on Pom-
ona 's defense. 

Felicia Faro took a free kick 
in~ide Pomona's half that bounced 
around in the box until Susan Kra-
m er was able to bring the ball down 
and put it in the back of the net for a

X-country 
takes 5th 
in invite 
By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Sport. Editor 

The 1987 season is quickly 
coming to a close for the UCSD 
cross country team. But that isn't 
slowing the runners down as the 
men's and women's teams placed 
fifth and fourth respectively thili 
past weekend at the Cal-Poly 
Pomona Bronco Invitational. 

The men's race consisted of a 
mixture of all three divisions. But 
that did not make much of a differ-
ence to Triton Coach Mark Stan-
forth . "I was not imprellled with the 
men's race at all," said Stanforth. 
"We would have placed much 
higher if our team was al full 
strength. The Division I and II 
teams were running their B-teams, 
so we really could have done mud! 
better." 

The men's team faced some dif-
ficulties before the race even began. 
Two of the top seven runners did 
not compete due to iUness and 
Chris McNatt , usually UCSD's top 
finisher, had to drop from competi-
tion with a strained Achille's ten-
don almost a mile and jl half into 
the race . Despite these problems, 
Tim Vallez managed to fini sh 16th, 
with a time of 25:20. Menel Hora 
and Roger Webb finished 25th and 
33rd, with respective times of 25:32 
and 25:47 . The men finished with 
154 points , behind UC Irvine(86), 
CSU Pomona (1 02) , CSU Bakers-
field (127) and Point Loma Uni -
versity (136). 

"[The men 's team] 
would have placed 
much higher if our team 
was at full strength." 

-Mark Stanforth 
cross country coach 

Other teams that attended were 
US1U , (sixth place with a score of 
162), and CSU Los Angeles (sev-
enth with 307 points). Since the 
race was an open invitational, a 
number of unattached colleges ran 
in the men's division as well. 

The women's team had a little 
more luck than the men . All of their 
top runners competed and, for the 
first time all year, finished close 
together. 

Denise McFayden, the women's 
top runner , had been running with 
the top five lor a good part of the 
5,OOO-meler course. But a specta-
tor misdirected her and she lost 
ground, eventually finishing 14th 
in 18:08. "Someone mUlt have 
thought that the women run the 
same courae aa the men and told 
her to 10 the wrong way. She ,til 
finislwd with a lP'eal time," ex-
pIaiae4 Stanforth. 

Sabriaa JeMen tw.hed in 18: 15 
lei ta" I 8th. Giaele E..,.... cOt'· 
tinued to improve to Ja.t year', 
caliber, fini.hing 34th in 19: 11, 
still 48 aeconds . &Ower than her fin-
ish in la. t year', invitational. "The 
women ran the best they have all 
year as a team," boasted Slan-
forlh. "They finished as a group, 
ralher than a~ individuals."

her time last year ," said Stanforth. 
"She has had an excellent year." 

Cal Poly Pomona's B-team took 
the women's division without a 
problem, scoring 61 points. They 
were followed by UCLA (96) and 
CSU Los Angeles (14 7). USIU fin-
ished sixth with 191 points but 
were eighth in the Aztec Invita-
tional, 110 placing above them was a 
big accomplishment for the 
women's team. "A lot of the race 
was run on asphalt which made the 
times much faster than usual," said 
Stanforth. "That might have helped 
our team considerably." 

The teams do not race again 
until the UCSD-hosted Cro .. Coun-
try Championship on Nov. 2. De-
pending on the construction sche-
dule, the race should begin alII :00 
on John Hopkins road, just north of 
the Supercomputer. rei

Continued from PIlle 20 
2-1 Iead_ A lead that UCSD made 
stand up for the rest of the game. 

Coach Brian McManus said it 
was a very physical game and was 
happy with the way the team played 
against the tough Division II team. 

The win give. the women'. learn 
a 11 -1-1 record (they are ranked 
sixth nationally), which should vir-
tually assure them a spot in next 
month'. NCAA playoffs. I say vir-
tually because in the paat, the 
NCAA playoff committee has been 
known to play favorites to east 
coast teams. If UCSD does well in 
its remaining games, though, their 
impressive record should be enough 
to overcome any Eastern bias of 
the playoff committee members. 

Next week UCSD has three home 
games starting on Tuesday at 1 :00 
pm against Chapman. On Friday 
they have a rematch aainst Cal-
Poly Pomona at 3 :00 pm, and a 
big game against Division I 51. 
Mary's Sunday at 12:00 noon. All 
three games will be at Warren field .
