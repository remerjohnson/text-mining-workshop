Clinton Proposes Increasing Education Spending 
BUDGET: Plan 
includes tax credits and 
more, larger PeB Grants 
By Naomi Falk 
Staff Writer 

Pre ident Clinton outlined last 
Tuesday hi s plans for a balanced 
budget, plans that include a large 
increa e in federal support for higher 
education. 

$34 billion from when he first took 
office . The plans include tax crcdits 
for individuals enrolled in commu-
nity college and tuition tax credits 
for families. 

Clinton al 0 promi sed to in rease 
funds forthe Pell Grant, Work-Study 
and loan program . 

"These proposals will move us 
much closer to our clear national 
goal... where every 18-year-old can 
go to co llege," Clinton said at 
Tuesday's pre s conference - the 
first since his second inauguration. 

would be abl e to deduct up to 
$10.000 a year forthe cost of attcnd-

without paying taxes on the money 
they a\le. omJllunity-co liege stu-
dents would he able to deduct $1 ,500 
from their taxes for the co t of at-
tending school. 

The maximum Pell Grant award 
would increase to 3.000, the larg-
est increase in the last 20 years. Thi s 
increase would be in aduition to the 
$300 increase late las t year.

California Legislators Warn of Potential 
Federal Funding Loss in SP-l Complaint 
CHARGE: Groups allege July 
1995 action violates federal 
equal-opportunity regulations 
By Naomi Falk 
Staff Writer 

.. California A~semb l y SpeakerCruL BUMamante 
and 56 memhers of the Assembly and Senate sent 
a leller to UC President Richard Atkinson on Jan. 
28, addres 'ing a complai nt against P- I fi led last 
month wi th the Office of Federal Contract Com-
pliance Programs. 

SP- I, approved by the UC Board of Regents in 
July 1995, eliminates all affirmative-ac ti on poli -
cies used in uni ver ity admissions - including 
graduate and profes ional schools. 

The complaint was fil ed on Jan. 10 by the 
Mexican American Legal Defen e and Educa-
tional Fund (MALDEF) and the ational A~soc i a­
tion for the Ad va ncement of Colored People 
(NAACP). 

The groups claim that SP- I violates the Uni -
versi ty of California' obl igation as a federal eon-

tractor to obey equal-opportunity hiring rcgula-
tions. 

UC Deputy Genera l ounsel Gary Morrison 
sa id he was unconcerned about the complaint. 
Morri son said clai ming that SP- I docs not compl y 
would be a "fa r ~ t re tch ," because SP-2, which was 
passed at the same time and eliminates af'lirllla -
tive-action cri teria in facult y and ~ t aff hiring, was 
found 10 be with in federal law. 

Morrison sa id the regents inserted language 
into SP- I and SP-2 that would automaticall y 
nullify the measures if any federal agency found 
them unlawful. Should the OFCCP fi nd SP- I 
illegal, federal funds would not be jeopardi zed. 

As many graduate and profe~s iona l students 
go on to become teaching and research assistants, 
MALDEF and the AACP ' ay that such admis-
sions are functionall y equi va lent to hiring and 
training. 

If the OFCCP finds the complaint valid, the 
regents' elimination of affirmative-action criteria 
in the selection of graduate and professional stu-
dents is in violation of federal law.

Espresso 
Roma to Stay 
Open Longer 
JAVA: Official ' will decide 
in spring whether to make 
I a.m. clo ing permanent 
By Beatrice Ammann 
Guardian Reporter 

When midnight ro ll s around one ciln usu-
ally sec students begin to squirm in their 
scats as they anti ci pate Espres~o .Roma' s 
closing down for the night. 

However, for students' studying conve-
nience, the popular campus coffee shop wi ll 
remai n open unt il I a.m. th is quarter. 

Erin Holve, UCS D Associated Studcnts 
o lll l11i s ~ i o ne r or ervices & Enterprises, 

said ~ he k it students wan teu more late-ni ght 
studying opti ons and raised the.issue hcl'ore 
the University cnters AdVisory Board 
(U AB). 

"I did not ha\le students comc up to me 
and :~ pcc ili ca ll y complain-about Espresso 
Roma 's hours, but I got a general -sense 
feedback that people are not happy," Holve 
said. 

UCAB oversees all aspects of the Stu-
dent Center and the Price Center - includ-
ing the food vendor!>, like Espre!>so Roma. 

Acco rd ing to University enter ' Direc-
tor James arruthers, Espresso Roma wi II 
be open Sunday th rough Thursday unt il I 
a.m. throughout winter quarter as a trial 
period. 

"If there is an impetus from students to 
have longer hours then we can provide an 
ex tension of our ~erv i ce!> ," Carruthers said. 

Warren junior Chris Gee, interim CA B 
chair, said the board wi II review the effects 
of keeping Es presso Roma open unt i I I a.m. 
at the end of the quarter. 

At that time, the board will evaluate the 
eafc's traffic and dec ide whether to keep it 
open late permanently. 

Both UCAB and Espresso Roma's man-
agement have ex pressed concern that there 
will not be enough paying customers late at 
night to pay the shop's expenses. 

Carruther ,Gee and Holve all sa id even-
tually subsidi zi ng Espresso Roma with 
UCAB or A.S. funds may be po sible, but 
the cafe so far has enough customer to 
break even.

H ospital Problems are 
Rooted in Poor Decisions 
Made by the DC Regents 
By Naomi Falk 
Staff Wnter 

A, a result of the hi gh costs of 
malntaJIllng a teaching hospital 
and providing medical ca re for 
Indlgen". the UCSD Medi cal 
Cl.: nle r ha~ found itself In a grave 
fi nanCial ' Ituation . This c risi s. 
however, ha~ onl y been COIl1 -
pounded hy neg li gent funding on 
the part of the state and poor deci -
lon, hy hoth the UC Regents and 
Icsn. 

Among all of the hea lth-care 
pfl)vlder~ In tlfe area, UeS D treat> 
the grea test numher of an 

Dl q!\l'~ poor. La,t year, the 
Medl l:JI Ccnter ex peril.:nced a 
deficit ul 20 milllun, caused in 
part hy prov ldll1g medica l ca re for 
those who cou ld not afford it. 

In the past. 'an Diego County 
has a,sls ted the hospital In cover-

as being a first -rate hospital. there 
arc more than enough hospitals 111 
the San Diego area without it. 
Even at the time of .Thornton 's 
constructi on three years ago, San 
Diego WU\ one of the mos t ho~pl ­
tal -saturated areas in the ~ t atc . At 
that lIIlle, the bed~ in existing ho,-
pitals were not lilled to capacity. 
As a result of the managed-care 
revoluti on. there is now even less 
demand for hospital s la) ~. 

Seeing how Thornton Hospital 
will he unahle t(\ operate at half III 
its capaut) lorever. one can enn -
dude th at the lInlver~lty would 
have been hetter oil not huddlllg 
the hosp ital III the 1'1 rst plac;c. and 
instead IIlvestlng those resource, 
in alre<tdy eX isting medica l la~ilt ­

The opera tIOn 01 a teadll llg 
hospital also costs more than the 

In g these expenses. 
However. the coun-
t) no longer 
believes th at It IS lis 
responsibilit y to 
proVide these funds. 
but rather the 
state·s. As a result , 
the $10 million that 
the county used to 
provide annually 
has dwind led to 
about $2 mi ll ion. 

Simi larly, Gov. 
Pele Wilson 

Selling 
hospitals that 
are part of a 
public trust is 
not the right 
of the 
university or 
of the state, 
and In fact 
violates that 

operati on of a nor-
Illal hospital. 
Though the tcadllng 
hospital was created 
by the state as part 
of the public uni ver-
si ty system, state 
leg islalOrs of late 
have not felt the 

believes that ti nanc- public trust. 
ing eare for indi -

need 10 continue to 
support it. The state 
once provided 100 
percent of the funds 
for instruction. That 
amount has dwin -
dled to a mere 15 

gents, many of whom are illega l 
immigrants, is the responsibility 
of the federal govern ment. 
Consequently, the UCSD medical 
center is bei ng held hostage fi nan-
cially by county, state and fede ral 
governments, as they do batt le 
over the responsibi lity of fi nanc-
ing indigent care . Tragically 
caught in the middle, UeSD is left 
to 3hsmb the resulting financial 
loss. 

To all eviate the hudget crisis, 
UeSD adlllini~tra ti o n took some 
imlllediate step ' to cut costs, such 
as laying orr around 500 workers. 
While this m;IY ha ve heen a good 
mo ve for everyone concerned 
(with the excep ti on of the 
workers and their families), 
this proh1cm could have been 
avoided . 

The higger problem is 
Thornton Hospi tal. The 

eonstruction of 
Thornton Hospital was 

a costly blunder on the 
part of the university. 

While the facility is lauded 

percent, leavi ng the 
un i versily desperate to find Ihe 
resources needed to keep the hos-
pitals open. 

However. faul t does not lie 
onl y wi th county, state and feder-
al legis lators. The manner in 
which the UC has attempted to 
solve its fi nancia l woes has been 
both short-sighted and haphazard. 
The problem of maintaining high-
cost teaching hospitals in the face 
of declin ing funds has been a 
problem for all fi ve UC medical 
schoo ls. 

The ue Board of Regents has 
utterly failed to address the prob-
lem in any ~ystemwide fashion, 
mere ly granting permissi on to 
individual campuses to pursue 
mergers with other health-care 
providl!r, . 

Allowi ng a non-academic. for-
profit organi zation to take control 
of a ue teaching ho pital is a 
ri ky move. A private orgafli za-
tion will lind itself in a contli ct of 
inlcrest as it struggles to maintain 
profit margi ns for tock holders

money. eo nver~atl ()n - anythi ng. 
He once drove an hour and a half 
fro m school to downtow n San 
Diego and then over to Poway in 
traflie and rain to run an important 

errand for a friend' s roommate -
someone he had never c ven met. 

We often went to McDona ld 's 
at night , and Scth always gave 
money to the same homeless man 
who stond outside and asked us I'll[ 
spare change. I never. aw the man 
thank Seth or show him anv grati -
tude. hut Seth ne ve r failed to give 
to him. 

There were many pcople In 
Scth 's life that ca me to him asking 
things of him , and he always 
responded grac iously. I I' I nceded 
to talk ahout anything important -
or tri Vial - I could count on Selh 
to li sten and give good advJt:c. 
which he gave WJlh a great ense 
of humor. He alway~ had .In 
answer for my wornes. prohlems 
which now seem tin y In compari -
son to his . 

Seth was an incrcdihle con ver-
salionalist. He could talk ahout 
scemingly anything with anyhody. 
He would spend hours late at night 
speaking wit h friends. nelghhors 
and often strangers. 

Seth had an amazing memory 

• • 

I will cherish the 
time I spent with 
Seth, and I only 
wish ou~ friendship 
could have lasted a 
lifetime rather than 
j ust five short 
months. We didn't 
plan on being 
apartment mates 
last September ..• 
however, I couldn't 
have chosen a 
better living mate 
or a better friend 
than Seth. 

and an amazing Intelligence. Hi s 
knowledge and interests werc deep 
and broad, and undoubtcd ly played 
a gre:1t part 111 his ability to engage 
the people around him in conver. a-

tion. My w nversallons with Seth 
rangcd fro m movies 10 sport s to 
II lliSIC to politics to thcology 10 
what w~ were 1!oi ng to cook for 
dinncr that ni ght. 

Seth had rcad almost l!very 
hook that I had read . He could talk 
about them In great det~lil. making 
thoughtful comments ahoutthcm. I 
lis tcned oncc a~ he e:lrrled on a 
complex COll\ ersall on with a 
s<.: nior phi losuphy major ahout 
philosophers I'd newr heard of. 
He was neith..:r a phi losophy major 
nor a literature major. hilt hc edu-

of what he had learned that he 
could ~peak \Y Jlh mahout our 

respe~1I ve stull ie, a~ I I' he had heen 
through all the ,;II11e dasses that 
we had taken. 

Seth could repeat Ilearly verba-
tlill Iyncs to songs that he had 
he:lrd nn Iy twu or three times. I 
learned j ust by heing around Seth . 
He laught me l1Ior ' than he could 
have ev~ r known. 

. cth had a way wi th people. He 
had the ahilJly to understand. to 

listen, to hring happiness to them. 
He was compassionate. I remem-
ber in trodm:ing friends to Set h. 
Initially there would be the tension 
and awkwardness that e:X I ~ts 
hctween people wh~n they liN 
Ill..:et. whcn they have to ,earch for 
things to ,ay to eac h other. 
However, hy the end of the night. 
everyone would h~ co mpletely 
relaxed. and everyone ... face would 
be content , laughing and glowi ng. 

Seth had that effect on people . 
In hiS own slow and unique man-
lier of speaking, hi s words were 
sooth i ng and made cveryo n<.: 
around him feel at l'a~e . 

Despite all the palll that Seth

the lasl three years, the regents 
have ra ised fees for incoming

The UC is an inv aluable

California'S poorer communities. 
Many UC graduates hecome doc-

rockeling fees, the UCSD admin-
istral ion has been guilty of mis-
managi ng the hos pital. While 
studenls have more th an bo rne 
their share of the pain, hosp ital 
adminis tralors sure haven ' t fell 
it. The regents have w nt inucd to 
increase the salaries of admi nis -
tralOrs, raising them by as much 
as 21 percent inane year. 

Foremusl among the adm i n i~­
tration 's blunders is the hiring of 
high-priced consult anls in a lime 
of fin ancia l cri sis . In the last 
year, the administration retai ned 
the services of fi ve indiv iduals 
who were paid monthl y sa lari es 
ra ngi ng fro m $45.000 10 
$63,000. Two consultants are 
still on the uni ve rsity'S payroll . 

Poor decisions aside, a solu -
tion must be fo und to keep hospi -
tal doors open and maintai n the 
quality of teaching programs. To 
fulfill the mission of providing 
quality education to UC medi cal 
student s, the state must provide 
full fundin g. To ma inlain Ihe 
financial sol vency of the hospi -
lal , the county, stale and federal 
go vernments must resol ve their 
differences and provide fund s for

UCSD Medical Center: Despite losing $20.3 million last year, UCSD administrators say the un iverslty 's troubled medical center 
is back on track and may avoid a lease altogether through increased strategic partners hips and expanded affil iations . 

As UCSD considers leasing its flagship medical

potential suitors, some wonder if the beleaguered

SHOULD UCSD HAVE DIVISION I SPORTS? 
Interviews by Dan Sweeney • Photography by Zakl Rubenstein 

From what I've seen at 
other schools, sports 
involvement has a unify-
ing effect on the school 
just like anything else 
that 's domi nant in the 
community. I'm personal-
ly not that into watching 
sports. But would I watch 
if we had big games broad-
cast on television? Sure I 
would .

. . I ' 

UCSD college is di vid-
ed enough as it is, what 
with the five colleges and 
all. And therefore, if we 
tried to pull a Division-I 
team and all the money 
and all the things, we just 
don 't have the necessary 
ambience to get the envi -
ronment we need for 
Division-I support . We 
can't start from scratch on 
that. Maybe when I'm 40 
and an alumn[us) ... 

Christian Wood 
Marshall Junior 

" , 
I. r I ., 

I'd go for Division I 
only if people that we took 
met the [academic] cri teri a 
that everyone else doe~ . 
You don ' t come here just 
because you're good at 
athletics. To me, UCSD is 
more of an institution than 
a coll ege, because we 
don 'L have the football 
team and what not. I came 
here because of science, 
not for [the sports]. 

Andre. Sharp 
Revelle Senior 

I think for a player to 
play at the college level, 
th ey should receive a 
scholarship. If they don't,

"My goal - my responsibility

Vi l.:e Chancellor of Health Sciences 
John Alksne said. HI can'l do thaI 
without a leaching hospital." 

Although uni versity officials 
are quick to say Dynes hasn ' t ruled 
oul any options, Alksne indicated 
at la ·t month 's regents' meeti ng 
thaI he and the chancellor are 
exploring more targeted 
relationships and may have moved 
away from stri ct ly hospita l-based 
partnerships.

a lease for both the UCSD Medical

"We have to ha ve a certain 
segment of paying patients coming

I'm taning to believe thai. In the 
third grade, it was easier to run with 
tre popular crowd and make fun of 
all the "geeks and losers." Everything 
was fun and games until the mob 
turned the tables, (like a pack of 
hyenas), and atlacked one of its own. 

In between classes, my Job. 
and my SOCia l life, I' ve somehow 
f(l und the ti me to become cold and 
heartl ess. one of the hyenas. 

Lately I feci like I' ve ix:cn fai ling

I'm a.~hamcd of it , but I don't 
think i t '~ tOO late. I think there slIlI 
mighl be a ~hred of compassion and 
an Iota of intelligence left in me. 
There's still a part of me lhat feels 
Sick every time someone makes a 
nasty remark aboul homosexuals, 
wi mps or "tree-huggers." I can't 
ever be the same nai ve, optimistic

Safe: UCSO's Ryan Hill was safe on this play, but Concordia was a step ahead - sweeping both games. 

Opening Day is a Double Whammy 
By Travis Hili

day wa~ spoilcd when the vi~i ting 
Coyote, took hoth end, oflhedoublc· 
dip. 14-6 and 9-6. 

Triton Head Coach Roben Fletcher 

lost I I seniors from the squad last 
ycar, including sluggers Craig Burke 
and Carl Abramson, who last year 
combined for over 30 homers. Al-
though Fletcher lost these players, he 
does have a wealth of young talenlto 
work with. 

Early on this year, expect Flelcher 
to experiment with his lineup. search-
ing for the right ways 10 use his play-
ers. The pitching sLaff will pose a 
problcm because of Ihe lack of expe-
rience on the mound. But once again. 
Flelcher has quite a few live amlS to 
tinker with .

Tritons Salt Santa Cruz 
and Chop Down Oaks 
SWEEP: Extending its winning streak to fi ve, the UCSD men's basketball 
squad defeated both UC Santa Cruz and Menlo College last weekend 
By Kevin McLaughlin 
Senior Staff Writer 

With a big road trip approach-
ing, the men 's baskethall team has 
already kicked into crui e con-
trol. Playing back-to-hack 
horne games this weekend, 
the men easi Iy raced past an 
un de rpowered pair of 
team s, defeating Menlo 
College and UC Santa Crul 
handily . 

ow the m..:n must stay 
focu)'ed on the lour-game 
road trip that loom~ ahead, 
as they travel to The Master'), 
Co llege for one of their toughest 
battles to date 

In Friday nigh t's aCll on, the Illen 
squared of I' agai nst the Oaks of 
Menlo ollege, tWice the Triton~ ' 
victims last ~eas()n. A new coach 
made lillie difference for the Oaks, 
who lost to the Trit(Jn~, 87-65. 

The Tritons had a rough ni ght 
shoollng the hall, finishing the game 
at 43 percent from the field . How-
ever, the Oaks matched that per-
centage and made only four shots 
from behind the arc. As generous 
visitors, Menlo committed 22 turn-
overs in the contest and gave up 15 
offensive rebounds to a noti ce;)b ly 
more physica l Triton te;)m. 

Ea rly in the second half, Menlo 
closed to within two points of the 

Tritons with some heightened de-
fensive pressure . omething that ha 
nustered the men ' squad from time 
to time. Swingman Nick Maroutsos 
answered the call off the bench, how-

ever, showcasing his deadly 
three-poi nt shooting. 

A couple of quick shots 
and a few minutes later, the 
men were ;)head 60-46. ;) le;)d 
they would onl y build on un-
til the fi nal buzzer. 

aturday night saw the 
underwed Banana Sl ugs of 
UC Santa rU/. try thei r luck 

agai nst the Tritons. Our UC breth-
ren to the north came in hoping to 
Improve on their 1- 17 all -lIIne record 
agalilst CSD. Giving no chari ty. 
the Tritons looked to cen ter Matt 
Aun..: early and often as he pi led up 
33 pOints, including hi s firs t three-
poin ter of the season. 

Aune added 15 rebounds and 
guard Mark Sebek dished out nine 
assists In limited play. Every Triton 
hut onl: scored as the m!:n improved 
on their dismal hooting orthe ni ght 
before to hit on 62 percell! of their 
field -goal allempts . 

Looking ~ Iuggi s h and a lillie 
trave l-weary, the UCSC team hit 
only 32 percent of its shots in a 101 -
61 U SD trounci ng. 

"When you have more talent than 
the opponent , it tends to make you 

look good," Tri ton Head Coach Greg 
Lanthier said of the latest blowouts. 

Having played 10 of their last 
II games at home, the Tritons will 
put what has become a fine-tuned 
race car of a tea m on the road . A 
hi stori cal nemes is, known as The 
Master's College, will provide a 
big test for thi s smoothly running 
squad . 

The men will fo llow that match 
by grinding gears at Chapman, 
Menlo and CSC - all teams 
they have beaten at RIMAe. But 
playing on th l.: road is another 
maller, and the Tri ton ' expect a 
hall ie at every turn . 

" It ' ll be kind of tough up north , 
hut so far we 've played really well 
on the road ," said freshman Mi chael 
McMillan. "Hopefu ll y we can fin -
ish strong." 

Playing with excellent chemis-
try, the men still hope to reach the 
postseason tournament. If they can 
sweep this road trip - a very rea li s-
ti c goa l - then all that rcmai ns is a 
Feb. 25 home match-up against 

hri~tia n Heritage, a team that beat 
the Tritons earli erthi s season. How-
ever, this is a much-i mproved bunch 
ofTrilOns, and a team that i enjoy-
ing it current winning streak. 

"These guys are gelli ng along 
well and that always helps," Lanthier 
said . 

Road Warriors Demolisb No-Cal Competition 
DOMINANCE: Winni ng by an average margin of 39 point , the UCS D women crushed UC Santa Cruz and Holy Names 
By Travis Hill 
Staff Writer 

One word : wow. 
Two games,two wins, total mar-

gi n of victory: 79 points. 
The UCSD women's basketball

The Triton ~ were ex pccting a 
'erious challenge from the women 
of Holy Names, a team loaded with 
talent. Holy Na mes had already 
defe;)ted oncordia ollege this 
season, an imp ressive victory 
agai nst one of the best teams in 

Di vision III. The Tritons assumed 
that they would have another war 
on their hands, but they wanted 
thi s win and were fired up 
for the tip-o ff. 

[t turned out that tip-off 
time would be the clo est 
Holy Names would get to 
the Tritons. UCSDcameout 
red hot, beginning the game 
with a 17-3 run , and never 
looked bac k. 

From there, Head oach Judy 
Malone lIsed everyone of her play-
ers, and everyone of them was ef-
fec tive. The stifling Triton defense 
welcomed th e return of Karl i 
Jungwi rth and created 27 turnovers, 
six blocked shols and 16 steals. . 

Al the half the score was 6-13, 
and from there the Tri tons cruised to

a 41 -point victory, 71-32. 
"Holy ames had great talent ," 

Malone said . "They had lost their 
head coach recently, but even 
with him I don ' t think they 
could ha ve beaten us. We 
played ex tremel y welL" 

The Tritons then trav-
eled to Santa Cru/. for a 
bailie wi t h the 7 -12 Banana 
Slugs. 

The Triton didn ' t ex pect 
the same challenge that the prcviou. 
night had offered, hut they didn ' t 
look past thl.:ir opponents ei ther -
although the Banana Slugs wished 
they had, after they rece ived an 8 1-
44 thrashing at the hands of the 
Tritons. 

Like the Holy ames ga me, thi 
one was never close. U SO led at 

the half, 37-23, and continued the off run . 
ons l;)ught in the econd peri od. [n 
the second half, the Tritons domi-
nated the offensive glass with their 
aggress l ve frOlllcourt play of Anne 
Westmoreland, Sarah Schneider and 
Youngworth . 

Once again , defense was the 
name of the game, as the Tritons 
created turnover and made the 
Banana Slugs pay on the other end 
by converting them into bucket . 
Malone al so got 

Anne Westmoreland had a great 
trip, leading the squad with 32 total 
point s and three blocked shots. 
Ci ndy Yamasak i went a combined 
5- 10 from beyond the three-poi nt 
line and had eight stea ls. 

But thi s road trip was not about 
individual stati stics, it was about 
team - every player on the Triton 
roster contributed poi nts to the win-
ning effort.
