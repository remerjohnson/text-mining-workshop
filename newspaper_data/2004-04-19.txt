Rainy weather dampens 
Admit Day events 

Organizers resort to emergency 
rain plan at Price Center 

By CHRlmNE KWON 
Staff Writer 

Hundreds of prospective stu-
dents and their parents crowded 
the UCSD campus on the morning 
of Admit Day, dampened by the 
rainy weather that came hours 
after its start. Admit Day organiz-
ers reverted to an emergency rain 
plan, but the concurrently sched-
uled cultural celebration, 
Crossroads '04, which takes place 
annually alongside Admit Day, was 
forced to cancel most of its 
planned events. 

During heavy showers in the 

afternoon, parents and students 
crowded under the enclaves of 
Center Hall, Price Center and 
UCSD Bookstore. 

Student organizations left 
their tables on Library Walk and 
opted to take shelter in the Price 
Center ballrooms and the Sun 
God Lounge, while visitors gath-
ered in the bookstore, sifting 
through various UCSD parapher-
nalia. 

"It's been pretty crazy.. . We 
were well-staffed, though," UCSD 
Bookstore Director John Turk

to consider. 
One in five women report 

that they have been raped or sex-
ually assaulted in their lifetime, 
and every 21 hours, there is a 
rape on a college campus, Pae 
said. 

"Reading it and Ii tening to it, 
it doesn't really hit," Pae said. "A 
lot of the time, people don't talk 
about it and it's something quiet, 
hidden away and blamed on one 
person. In actuality, it's not just 
one person's issue, but affects the 
entire community." 

Pae expre ed her aggravation 
over the statistics, but also had a 
hopeful mes age about recovery 
and the future. 

"It's really frustrating knowing 
that I'm only one per on and I can 
only do so much, but it's really 
comforting to know that there are 
so many people out there that can 
help, there for support and 
encouragement," she said. "It's 
also nice to be part of this UCSD 
community knowing that we are 
all here in that fight to imagine a 
world without violence."

an anonymous poetry reading 
took plllce, followed by a speech

San Diego Lifeguard services 
said on April 18 that Sixth College 
freshman Daniel Lee Cho, who has 
been missing since his disappear-
ance from La Jolla Shores State 
Beach on April 14, has not yet been 
located. The search for Cho will be 
evaluated on a daily basis, 
Lifeguard services said. 

The church that Cho attended 
opened its doors to the UCSD 
community on April 18. TheJe us 
Community Church hoped to 
bring the UCSD community closer 
together through the event. 

"On behalf of the Jesus 
Communjty Church, we would like 
to offer up our condolences, 
prayers and support to Daniel 
Cho's family and friends," pastor 
Walter Ko aid. "We are all in 
mourning and Daniel will be 
missed by many. This has been a 
tragic experience for all of us." 

Sixth College Provost Gabriele 
Wienhausen said she appreciated 
the gesture made by Ko and by 
Cho's family. 

"It helps us that they allow us to 
be part of this," Wienhausen said. 
"It's an opportunity for us as a com-
munity to learn who we are and to

Students rally ~gainst cuts as part 
of statewide week of adion 

By SOFIA MARIN 
Staff Writer 

In the second campus protest 
against fee hikes this year, UCSD 
students, faculty and community 
members rallied in opposition to 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
proposed cuts to higher education 
on April 15. The rally, organized 
by the UCSD Coalition to Stop 
the Cuts, began at noon on 
Library Walk, followed by a 
march to the Office of the 
Registrar. 

According to Jessica Lopez, 
organizer with the statewide Stop 
the Cuts network, approximately 
100 people attended the hour-
long rally. 

The protest was part of a 
statewide week of action at the 
UC, CSU and community col-
lege systems, highlighting the 
consequences of the proposed 
cuts. 

Student speakers from different 
levels of education and student gov-
ernment organizations addressed 
issues surrounding the budget pro-
posals. 

"Concerned students from 
across the state are staging a unit-
ed front to voice their concern and 
write out their frustrations with 
what has been determined in 
Sacramento," graduate student

cuts to higher education, making fIVe demands for changes to the state's budget 
speaker Lorena Marquez said. 
"The voice of students has not 
been taken into account." 

The rally was held on National 
Tax Day to symbolize the tax that 
will be imposed on students, orga-
nizers and attendees said. 

"This is just going to make 
people not be able to pursue an 

education," lecturer Beatrice Pita 
said. "[The budget proposal) is 
like putting a tax on education." 

Speakers emphasized that one 
of the main objectives of the rally 
was to promote a statewide initi -

Bush proposes changes to 
Pell Grant programs 

By I.CHARD CLOUGH 
Daily Bruin (U. Califomia-Los 

Angeles) 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES-

President George W. Bush pro-
posed comprehensive refonns in 
the Pell Grant program on April 6 
to finance a new grant program for 
college students studying math and 
science, causing some higher edu-
cation organizations to be con-
cerned about the initiative's scope 
and cost. 

If approved, the plan will create 
a 5100 million annual program to 
distribute 20,000 grants to low-
income college students with an 
emphasis on math and science_ 

In an April 6 speech at South 
Arkansas Community College, 
Bush said the program, called the 
Presidential Math and Science 
Scholars Fund, is vital to providing 
students with the necessary skills to 
fill the jobs in a changing work-
force. 

"See, a new skill set is necessary 
to fill the new jobs," Bush said_ 

The program requires congres-
sional approval before it can be 
implemented. 

Some higher education organi-
zations are worried the program 
will prioritize worker training over 
students' financial needs. 

"It's not clear if that is going to 
be a slippery slope for taking away 
all need-based aid," said Daniel 
Kaufman, a spokesman for the 
N ational Education Association. 
"It raises some concern on our 
part." , 

Rich Harpel, director of federal 
relations for the National 
Association of State Universities 
and Land-Grant Colleges, said he 
was uneasy over the program's 
potential beneficiaries, but said the 

program has not been flushed out 
enough to really determine its 
value. 

The program would not require 
any increase in government spend-
ing because it would be jointly 
financed through private sources 
and by revising the distribution 
procedure for Pell Grants, accord-
ing to a White House statement. 

"Currently, there is no limit on 
the number of years an individual 
can receive a Pell Grant to help pay 
for an undergraduate degree," the 
sutement said_ 

The bill proposes an eight-year 
limit for students pursuing a four-
year degree and a four-year limit 
for students pursuing a two-year 
degree. 

Pell Grants are the main source 
of federal grant money for college 
students. 

"Wben it was first created, [the 
Pelt Grant) covered almost all the 
cost of education: Kaufman said. 

But he said that as tuition has 
risen at schools around the country, 
"the Pelt Grant program has not 
kept pace with that." 

The average grant is about 
52,400 a year. The proposal would 
give an additional $5,000 per year. 

The $l00-miUion price tag of 
the Presidential Math and Science 
Scholars Fund would be evenly 
spli.t between public and private 
sectors, Bush said. 

"Fifty million 'dollars of federal 
money matched by $50 million in 
the private sector_- we·lI be able to 
raise that," Bush said. 

KaufTnan said the plan to pay 
through private sources is "good in 
theory," but such sources may be 
difficult to find in the current, 
uncertain economy.

Night: Students give personal testimonies 
continued /rom page I 

by Myclie Chavez of the Rape 
Crisis Center_ 

Chavez opened her remark.s 
by aclrnowledging and speaking 
directly to the men in atten-
dance. 

"You have the power in your 
hands to impact other men," 
Chavez said. "I challenge you all 
to really change, when men are 
objectifying women, when men 
are saying comments about her 
ass, or her tits, challenge them and 
stop - make it stop because every 
comment that is made not only 
perpetuates violence against 
women, but it makes it OK." 

According to Chavez, one in 
four women are sexually assaulted, 
while one in eight men are sexual-
ly assaulted. 

"We have the power in our 
hands to affect change. That's 
why we are here tonight," 
Chavel. said. "Rape does not dis-
criminate .. _ What is rape? It 's 
the dehumanization of a human 
being." 

After Chavez's remarks, musi-
cal guest Saba gave a vocal perfor-
mance of various songs related to 
the night'S topics. 

American Civil Liberties 
Union board member and UCSD 
political science lecturer M.E. 
Stephens subsequently spoke 
about gender equality and the 
elimination of sexual assault from 
society_ 

According to Stephens, the 
United States has the highest sex 
assault rate of all developed coun-
tries, outpacing Japan by 20 per-
cent. 

"Given all of the privilege in 
this country, that disrespect for 
humankind is unacceptable," 
Stephens said. "Don't any of you 
accept that for yourselves. You 
are here tonight because you

a._III topther: Sorority members prepare to march as part of "Take Back 
the Night" on April 15_ Speakers read statistics on violence against women and 
anonymous poems as part of the event 
reject that notion, because you 
respect yourselves and each 
other. " 

Stephens also stressed the 
necessity of gender equality_ 

"What I care about is the idea 
that tonight forward you will live 
with the notion that it is never 
without your consent," Stephens 
said. "And here's what we don't 
consent to; We don't consent to 
the fact that we have never had a 
woman president." 

According to Stephens, 25 per-
cent of California legislators are 
women and a woman earns only 
75 cents on every dollar a man 
makes. 

"I do not consent to that quar-
ter that somebody fuclcing stole 
from me," Stephens said. "It's not 
acceptable to me that there has 
never been a woman governor in 
the state of California. I do not 
consent to having my money 

taken or having my children beat-
en or sexually assaulted. So 
tonight, each and every one of you 
have to withdraw your consent to 
inferiority. " 

Stephens closed her speech by 
emphasil.ing the need for every-
one to actively participate in 
changing society. 

"Don't walk away tonight with 
a big warm fuzzy and do nothing. 
Don't listen to some cool music, 
link arms and sing 'Kwnbaya,' 
because that's not going to make 
you the governor of California," 
she said_ 

Following Stephens were 
open-mic testimonials in which 
srudents shared thei r personal 
experiences wi th audience mem-
bers. The night'S event closed wi th 
a campuswide candlelight march.

By RYAN DARBY 
Senior Staff Writer 

You really don't have to be especially 
perceptive to notice that despite its fine 
academic programs, UCSD can sometimes 
be a pretty boring school. 

The segregation of colleges has acted as 
an impediment to social interactions, and 
the universiry's fascist regulations and rub-
ber-billy-club securiry patrol have made it 
difficult to throw anything more than a 
high school -like "mocktail" party in the 
dorms. Freshman parking will be eliminat-
ed any year now, effectively trapping peo-
ple on campus, and there's no worthwhile 
reason for others to visit the campus. 

That's why UCSD needs the Greeks. 
It's imperative that the school playa more 
active role in supporting them . Aside from 
maybe the Board Club and ultimate frisbee 
team, the Greeks are pretty much the only 
campuswide organizations 

asking for advice, a service or a favor -
because they'll also ask you for help every 
now and then. 

This isn't just mindless philosophy; the 
evidence shows that Greek involvement is 
an outstanding springboard for success. 
The system has produced 76 percent of the 
member:s of Congress, 85 percent of 
Supreme Court justices since 1910, and all 
but two American presidents since 1825. 

The business world has also been 
friendly to the Greeks . They make up 85 
percent of Fortune 500 executives, and 
Greeks are the chief executive officers of 
43 of the 50 largest American corpora-
tions. Clearly, they are doing something 
right. 

Others argue that paying for member-
ship in such an organization is tantamount 
to buyin,g friends. If anyone willing to pay 
the money were accepted, that might be a 

more valid argument, but there's 
a rush process where the fraterni-

that throw good enough par-
ties for the average UCSD 
student to put down that 
physics book or stop playing 
Counter-Strike for a few 
hours. It's a pretry simple 
formula: find a house, attract 

PRO 
ty or sorority interacts with 
recrui ts to decide whether or not 
to accept them. This process 
implies that there is a real, non-
monetary connection . Besides, 
these are large, national non-

a bunch of guys and girls, 
toss in some cheep beer and 
everyone's happy. Sigma Chi, for example, 
used to have some of the best parties ever 
at its ranch house; it was literally a few 
acres of UCSD students acting like USC 
kids. Unfortunately, subsequent parties at 
that house have been broken up by police 
helicopters . 

While this is a sad reflection of the 
community'S hostility toward student life, 
there is definitely a positive impact the 
Greeks can have on UCSD's social atmos-
phere. Even if most fraternity parties are 
in relatively small houses far from campus 
and are broken up relatively early, it's a lot 
better than nothing. 

Moreover, look at the substantial bene-
fits enjoyed by members of the Greek sys-
tem, especially in terms of networking. 
One of the most valuable assets any college 
graduate can have is a broad network of 
friends in various professions who can help , 
you out in the future . When you're 
involved in a close-knit organization like a 
fraternity or sorority, you get to know a lot 
of people very well. You get a sense of how 
ambitious people are, what they want ro do 
aml how you might be able to help one 
another in the furure. 

Say you're interested in a career in pol-
iti cs . If you don't know a lot of people in a 
lot of different places, it's difficult to go 
very far. BlIt if you have fri ends who are 
involved in law, busi ness and government, 
your odds of success improve substantially. 
Fofttlnately, if you've developed a wide 
range of friends in different professions, 
you're able to work with them - whether 

profit organizations that require 
money to pay the bills. 

Obviously, people can simply be !Tiends 
without paying dues, but not while estab-
lishing a stable infrastrucrure that offers 
the networking opportunities that many 
students find so valuable. 

Because the Greek system offers so 
much for its members and the UCSD 
communiry as a whole, the school must do 
whatever it can to support it. The La Jolla 
community effectively prevents Greek 
housing from becoming a reality off-cam-
pus - first, with a housing ordinance 
(recently repealed) that made it difficult 
for more than five roommates to live 
together, and now. a de facto "ban" in the 
form of exorbitant housing prices - so the 
school must figure out a way to build it on 
campus. 

Construction would obviously cost a 
fortune, but it is something that must be 
advocated and prioritized by the A.S. 
Council, while working in tandem with the 
Greeks and (hopefully) the administration. 
For the past 15 years, dozens of A.S. pres-
idential candidates have pledged to work 
for on-campus Greek housing. In 1997, an 
entire Greek slate - "Revolution " -
emerged victorious in UCSD's A.S. elec-
tions. Although Greek issues are always 
discussed during election season, very little 
is done about them during the rest of the 
academic year. 

It's unclear where the funding would 
come from, but it 's obvious that student 
life would drastically improve if the 
Greeks were given a permanent location 
on campus.

APRIL 19, 1004 

By CHRIS TAYLOR 
Senior Staff Writer 

It is probably apparent to most involved 
with the Greek system that there is a great 
deal of resentment toward their system by 
non-Greeks. Even at Greek-deficient 
UCSD, the 18 Interfraternity Council and 
Panhellenic Association chapters (nine of 
each) have such a bad reputation among 
non-Greek srudents that it would be use-

. less to reiterate every factor that cements 
this reputation. 

Before any specific complaint can be 
made, it is important to understand that 
elements of this reputation stem from a 
lack of knowledge on behalf of the non-
Greek students. Admittedly, the Greek sys-
tem has been overly mistreated year after 
year. However, the students who harbor 
resentment of the Greeks aren't complete-
ly misguided . The system is far ftom per-
fect, and there are a number 

page 6 

members routinely avoid members of all 
ethnic and cultural groups that don't fit 
their established profile. While this pre-
serves some semblance of culture, it is 
detrimental to true diversity, which is the 
established goal of all undergraduate activ-
ities. Joining a fraternity or sorority actual-
ly hinders cross-cultural knowledge. 

Mostly unspoken, but often very effec-
tive, are the fees that keep the system 
exclusive. The steep dues can range from 
$100 to $500 per quarter, depending on 
the individual fraternity or sorority. But 
those who believe that the fees end there 
are sorely mistaken. Students are also 
encouraged to buy letters for everything 
from their pledge class to their little sis' 
and bm's. In that regard, even the famed 
Greek party atmosphere comes at a steep 
price. 

To their credit, the Greek system sup-
ports charities and community services. 

The methods used, however, are 
sometimes questionable. of reasons why it is intellecru-

ally beneficial to avoid rush-
ing during one's undergradu-
ate years. 

The most realistic problem 
is the reputation of exclusion. 
This is most likely the main 

(ON Recently, the Gamma Phi Beta chapter at the University of Missouri recently made. national news by sending out an e-mail 
requiring all of their members 

reason why so many non-
Greeks resent the 
system. While most Greek srudents don't 
actively avoid non-members, it is true that 
the vast majority of their time is spent 
away from the rest of the student 
body. This in itself is not wrong. In fact, 
nearly every srudent segregates himself to 
some degree. However, joining a political, 
religious or activity-based student organi-
zation is by and large less time consuming 
than rushing, not to mention the subse-
quent commitment to Greek brothers and 
sisters. 

As ~any commentators and professors 
have pointed out, the aspect of college that 
inspires true intellectual growth is not so 
much the book-learning and letter grades, 
but rather the wisdom gained through 
experience and interaction. This idea nul-
lifies the Greek critics' classic complaint 
that sorority girls have sub-par IQ's -
even if that were true, it doesn't really mat-
ter in the overall college education. 

However, it also implies that the 
amount of time Greek students spend 
exclusively with their group is detrimental 
to their wisdom. In this case, those who 
wish to pursue wisdom through experience 
and interaction would probably do well to 
avoid the homogenous lifestyle of the fra-
ternities and sororities. 

Try as they might to deny this, the 
Greek system is homogenous. It is true 
that there are organizations for most pan-
ethnic groups; however, instead of embrac-
ing their differences while living side by 
side, they segregate into different groups. 
Strolling down Library Walk, active Greek 

to give to a blood drive, despite 
any possible health conditions. 
During the campuswide blood 

drive competition, the chapter's blood 
donation coordinator told members, 
"We're not messing around. Punishment 
for not giving blood is going to be quite 
severe." The letter demanded that mem-
bers should, if necessary, lie to be allowed 
to give blood, no matter the conse-
quences. As Gamma Phi Beta illustrated, 
many fraternities and sororities go to 
unduly extreme lengths to support philan-
thropic causes. 

Then, of course, there is the well-worn 
complaint of hazing. Intense hazing, as 
portrayed in graphic detail by most major 
newspapers when it occurs, is rare among 
fraternities. Hazing, on occasion, can even 
be beneficial to discipline and bonding. 
However, as long as there are fraternities 
that base hazing on excess drinking and 
even more colorful forms of hedonism, it 
can be dangerous to pledges. 

Many pledges believe that these disad-
vantages are well worth the end result. The 
most convincing proof, though, that it is 
perfectly acceptable to avoid ·the Greek 
system, is that often, srudents can find the 
same benefits in other srudent organiza-
tions . Generally, these groups are less cost-
ly and with less drawbacks, and often found 
in surprising places. 

As one unseemly example, the UCSD 
fencing team in recent years has been a fra-
ternity in everything but name. Their 
social life is consistently active, often

Evelyn Hsieh 

Travis Layfield jumped at the chance to be a Marine. When recruiters came to his 
high school in Fremont, Calif., in 
2002, Travis was practically the 
first in line to enlist. Travis proud-
ly sported a tattoo of a feather, a 
reminder of his Native American 
heritage. His friends and family 
described him as deeply interested 
in the military even when he was 
young. He would watch military 
programs on the History Channel, 
and seemed destined for a career in 
the Marines. He arrived at Camp 
Pendleton, less than 40 miles away 
from San Diego, and was subse-
quently shipped to Germany, 
Kuwait, and finally, Iraq. Travis was 
fighting back insurgents in the 
Anbar province on April 6 when he 
was killed by enemy fire. He was 
19. 

Marcus Cherry, of Imperial 
Valley, was a football player who 
liked to sing. He even sang a pro-
posal of marriage to his girlfriend 
of more than two years. As a 
teenager, Marcus would write and 
perform Christian rap songs with 
his buddies. Marcus planned on 
enrolling in a performing arts 
school after he rerurned from Iraq, 
and was to wed on Nov. 20. A lance 
corporal, Marcus was promoted to 
team leader just before the vicious 
battle in the Anbar province 
claimed the lives of more than 20 
Camp Pendleton Marines. Marcus 
was among them. He was 18. 

Brad Shuder, of EI Dorado, 

Calif., was adopted from Korea 
when he was two years old. His 
friends affectionately called him a 
"crazy Asian" who played rugby 
and counseled troubled kids in 
high school. He was a passionate 
gourmet cook who wanted to 
attend culinary school and open a 
bakery after military service. He 
felt an inherent duty to serve in the 
Marines, and was even more 
adamant about it post-Sept. II . His 
parents tried to hold him back 
!Tom enlisting, but Brad was unde-
terred. He arrived at Camp 
Pendleton a month after the World 
Trade Center attacks. In Iraq, Brad 
was involved in the operations that

Catholic high school. Her father 
called her "baby girl" and her

Southern Connecticut State 
University before she left for the 
army. She was supposed to come 
back to the States to visit family 
and friends, but never got the

death is the same. The greatest

~ I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
UCSD feminist grou~ 

promote harmful myths 
Editor: 

It has come to my attention that 
several groups on campus, such as 
the Feminist Majority Leadership 
Alliance, are promoting the danger-
ous myth that the vast majority of 
domestic violence victims are 
women. 

If you loolc at the Web site of just 
about any feminist organization, 
you 'U find the following statistic: 95 
percent of domestic violence victims 
are women. Battered women's shel-
ters report this figure (which makes 
sense, considering that battered 
women's shelters don't accept men). 
This is clearly a biased number. 

So what's the real number? 
Several studies, such as one by 
Strauss and Gelles, have been done, 
using a better approach: anonymous 
surveys. In survey after survey, it has 
been shown that women attack their 
partners at roughly the same rate as 
men. Yet, feminist organizations 
seek to cover up the . truth and per-
petuate myths. 

Events lilce April IS's "Tala: Back 
the Night" work toward this goal. 
Such events don't create awareness 
for violence against women - a ter-
rible crime that people are already 
aware of. Instead, they hide 50% of 
the domestic violence problem by 

rnalring it appear as if only women 
are victims. 

So why is this important' 
Feminist groups are seeking to 

create a society in which only men 
are arrested for domestic violence, 
even when they can also be the vic-
tims - a society in which violent 
women are viewed as victims regard-
less of the circumstances. For 
decades, these groups have tried to 
obtain this goal by "educating" 
police forces, judges and other pe0-
ple in power. And they've had suc-
cess in the past: just a decade ago, 
male victims who sought help from 
the police were routinely arrested 
and accused of beihg the abuser. 
Female abusers were rarely put in 
jail. 

But recent events are encouralt-
ing: Menls rights groups have fought 
the feminists and are making 
progress - the situation for abused 
men is not as dire as it was a decade 
ago. There is still, however, wor" to 
be done. Only by refuting feminist 
myths can we gain equality for all.

The current state of the textbook

industry is atrocious. Textbook com-
panies are driving up the prices for 
students and taking advantage of 
their position in the market to gouge 
students. I un appalled at the under-
handed methods that the textbook 
industry is using to keep their prices 
high. While it is true that t~ 
need to be updated periodically, 
many textbook updates are simply 
unnecessary and serve only to sup-
press the used book market for stu-
dents and to inconvenience faculty. 

Thomsoo Learning lilces to claim 
that their products are driven by fac-
ulty demand. Hopefully, the fact that 
over 500 math professors from over 
100 colleges and universities across 
the country are coming together to 
call for action will prompt Thomson 
Learning and other publishers to 
rethinlc their practices. Thomson 
also claims they are simply pricing to 
the market. 1bis means they will 
simply lceep ripping students off 
until someone stops them. I am an 
engineering student here and I can 
attest to high prices. A new copy of 
my Computer Architecture book 
cost SI20 this quarter. I found the 
paperback international edition new 
on eBay for SH, including shipping. 
Fewer bells and whistles (i.e., CD-
ROMs we never use, black and white 
printing, paperback covers) would 
cost publishers less money and result 
in fairer prices for students, as in the 
international market. It is perfectly 
reasonable to expect textbook pub-
lishers to produce useful books at 
fair prices. 

"This is an issue affecting every 
student on this campus. I urge every-
one to go to bttp:/Iunuw.Cllipirgml-

On April 26, students across the

Students held a statewide meet-

demands on April 3, Lopez said. 
The five demands established were: 
no cuts to outreach and retention 
programs, no cuts to financial aid, 
no fee increases, no enrollment

Participating San Diego cam-

A Sixth College community 
meeting was also held on April 16 
at Camp Snoopy Dogg House for 
everyone at the college to get 
more information and talk about 
Cho's disappearance. 

According to San Diego 
Lifeguard services, lifeguards 
patrolling the shoreline have been 
instructed to scan the shore for 
Cho, while local helicopter agen-
cies have been asked to fly over the 
shoreline whenever possible. In 
addition, scuba searches for Cho 
took place on April 16, before 
unfavorable weather conditions 
forced scuba searches to be called 

off. According to lifeguard Lt. 
Nick Lerma, it is impossible to 
predict whether or not Cho will be 
found. 

"We've been continuing 
because we generally don't like to 
stop," Lerma said. "Our best hope 
is that he comes up on the shore-
line ... however, there's no guaran-
tee of that." . 

Wienhausen said that the loss 
was especially difficult for Sixth 
College because of its smaU size. 
Sixth College currently enrolls less 
than 700 students in its two classes. 

"We know that many students 
in the community are concerned 
and that many students knew about 

him and how caring and smart he 
was," Wienhausen said. "He was 
one of those people who was so 
incredibly bright that he could help 
other students srudy and learn." 

Cho, who was undeclared, was 
a member of the Asian American 
Christian Fellowship on campus. 
The MCF will hold a prayer ses-
sion for Cho at 7:30 p.m. on April 
19 in Humanities and Social 
Sciences room 1330. 

Psychological counselors are 
available to speak to srudents

for high school students in an 
effort to create more well-prepared

8 NEWS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, APRIL 19, ZOO4 

Admit: Most Crossroads events cancelled Women: More than 300 
participated in ' events continued from page I 

said. "The rain was unexpected, 
so we sold out of umbrellas - we 
sold more umbrellas today than 
we have in six months [just by 
noon)." 

The rain plan for Admit Day 
allowed for most of the activities 
to proceed as scheduled, with var-
ious location changes, and only 
one event was cancelled. 

"Before the rain it was pretty 
awesome - we got to take some 
people to the cliffs," said John 
Muir College Committee member 
Meg Gullo. "After the rain, it was 
interesting." 

Admit Day, which is held every 
April to welcome prospective stu-
dents and their parents to the 
campus, showcases each of 
UCSD's six colleges, the campus' 
student organizations and presen-
tations by different academic 
departments. 

In spit~ of the rainy weather, 
UCSD college ambassadors con-
ti nued to give college-speci fie and 
general campus tours to families 
and visitors. 

"Definitely good, friendly peo-
ple - they seem pretty coopera-
tive," said University High School 
senior Alex Early. Early said his 
interest in UCSD's engineering 
program drew him to the universi-
ty. 

"£ think it's a beautiful cam-
pus," said Early'S mother, Marina 
Early. 

Each college held separate 
receptions for Admit Day visi-
tors. 

"It went pretty well - we had 
free coffee for people and th.at 
kind of livened up people a little 
bit," said Revelle College assistant 
resident dean Pedro A. Scono. 

Los Angeles Baptist senior 
icole Mattison said she enjoyed 

Jennifer Downs!Guardian 
bin CO IW-r- Most events for Admit Day continued despite a rainy day on 
April 17. UCSD Bookstore sold out of umbrellas. 
the UCSD campus. 

"Everyone seems really nice 
and friendly," she said. "I think it's 
a really pretty campus." 

Some parents of prospective 
students said they were equally 
impressed. 

"It seems to be a good institu-
tion ... It looks like the teaching 
ratio is better than compared to 
other institutes," said Devender 
Reddy, father of prospective Stu-
dent Ashwan Reddy. 

Berkeley High School senior 
Toby Hargreves, who was accept-
ed to Muir coll.ege, was also 
enthusiastic about the university, 
saying "I was impressed with the 
dorms, the suite-style .. . lust 
coming from UCLA, the infor-
mal, casual attitude is really 
attractive, as well as the nice 
weather." 

Not all planned events sched-
uled for the day proceeded as 
expected. Because many of the 
events for the Cultural 
Crossroads celebration were 

planned to talee place outdoors, 
most of the international perfor-
mances, games and exhibitions 
were cancelled. 

The cultural celebration, 
which is organized every year on 
the same day as Admit Day, is 
sponsored by Thurgood Marshall 
College, the Leadership 
Committee for Cultural 
Connection and more than 20 
other organizations. 

Paul Srravinsley, program assis-
tant for Thurgood Marshall 
College, said the celebration 
would not be rescheduled. 

"They start planning this in 
November," said Stravinsky, who 
pointed passersby to the few 
indoor events that were not can-
celled. 

With rain pouring down only 
minutes after the scheduled II 
a.m. start of the cultural celebra-
tion, only a few food booths fea-
turing Indian and African cuisine 
remained after the others had 
packed up.

LGBT and sorority turnouts were 
fantastic. " 

" Given aU the

Monies collect-

Beeley's House, a 
set of townhouses

YWCA of San

offered include 

in which sexual 
violence penneates 
the lives of women 
around the world. 
The first "Take 
Back the Night" in 
the United States 
was held in San 
Francisco in 1978. 
This is the third 
time the A.S. 
Women's 
Commission has 
hosted the event at 
UCSD.

house's goal is to

Women's 
Commission mem-
ber Meredith 
Knell, the event went well, and she 
estimated that it attracted over 300 
attendees. 

"We are amazingly satisfied with 

Due to a high 
demand for the service, YWCA is 
raising funds to build Beeley's 
House 2, which will be constructed 
this fall. 

Cuts: About 100 UCSD 
students participate in rally 

coruinued from page 7 
cuts have affected his students. 

"I'm watching my students who 
cannot do their homeworlc or finish 
assignments because they have to 
worlc full-time to support them-
selves," Balthaser said. 

Several high school students 
discussed how they would be nega-
tively affeeted by the elimination of 
all K-12 outreach programs. 

Bonita Vista High School stu-
dent spealcer Leezel Ramos, a 

daughter of immigrant parents new 
to the California education syst~m, 
expressed that without outreach 
programs, she would know very lit-
tle about the higher education sys-
tem or financial aid options. 

"The budget cuts are really 
going to affect my family," Ramos 
said. "It's going to be hard for me to 
go to college."

Reefer Madness revisited on DVD 
Film's 'demon weed' elevated to new camp classic 

By IRIAN UICiA 
Staff Writer 

An anemic lcid fulls backward 
into a fountain, yelling, "I'm sorry" 
in a distinctive nasal twang, even 
though his lips aren't moving. 

The bastard child of Kramer 
and Shemp gets seriously wigged 
out playing ragtime, then walks 
into a closet and shows offhis abil-
ity to roll his eyes. 

A grandmother one-ups 
"American Idol" cast-off William 
Hung by 65 years, presenting the 
coveted "She Bangs" dance in the 
middle of a malee-out party. 

These images, and many others, 
have been enjoyed by countless 
audiences since the film "Reefer 
Madness" was released in 1938 as a 
propaganda film warning children 
and their parents of the multirude 
of dangers possible under the influ-
ence of the "demon weed" marijua-
na. The film was financed by a 
church group to help the Drug 
Enforcement Agency skewer the 
public image of marijuana. In these 
enlightened times, however, it has 
become tradition to enjoy the film 
as the height of camp entertain-
ment while completely wnked out 
of your head. 

In an effon to combat any 
residual seriousness left from 
"Reefer Madness," the folks at Off 
Color Films have colorized it in a 
nightmarish pastel scheme, com-
plete with orange suits and neon 
green puffs of smolee. (Apparently 
their target audience enjoys bright 
colors.) At any rate, with this new 
presentation, "Reefer Madness" 
has established itself as the ulti-
illite' ~OIft mockery movie. Who 
better to sit back and rip apart the 
film with you and your friends but 
"Mystery Science Theater 3000" 

alumnus Mike J. Nelson? 
Nelson has his own commen-

tary track on the DVD, which 
abandons all attempts at providing 
insightful commentary within the 
first minute, and instead devotes 
itself to tearing apan the film to 
hilarious effect. Everything from 
the terrible acting and the cine-
matography to the food obsessions 
of the characters are skewered 
without abandon. The jokes are 
not a~ regular or consistent as an 
episode of "Mystery Science 
Theater" since Nelson left his 
puppet companions at home, but 
over the course of the film, there 
are more than enough belly laughs 
to warrant several listenings. 
Another less interesting track 
chronicles the restoration and col-
orizing process, but any typical 
DVD commentary pales in com-
parison to Nelson's comedic opus. 

In keeping with the campy 
theme (and padding out the D VD, 
since the film is only one hour 
long), a shon comic documentary, 
"Grandpa'S Marijuana Handbook" 
by Evan "GI" . .mdpa Ganja" Keliher 
is included. In "Grandpa'S 
Marijuana Handbook," a 72 -year-
old pot smoker (Keliher) imparts 
nuggets of wisdom about how to 
grow marijuana (put it in a closet), 
how to buy marijuana (flag down a 
Hell's Angel or senior citizen), and 
what cats think about marijuana 
(they love to eat it). A fur cry from 
the Puritan camp of the feature, 
this documentary has a lot of lov-
able kitsch, and would make an 
excellent instruction video for any 
upcoming Sun God plans. 

The DVD will soon be in stores, 
anthmkes the perfect'~ft ~ 2f1 
your pothead friends. If you can't 
wait to experience the madness, 
however, you can view the film on 

April 20 (surprise!) at 7 p.m. at the 
San Diego Museum of 
Photographic Arts in Balboa Park. 
"Grandpa Ganja" will appear at the 
event, and audiences will be able to 
vote on whether or not they would 
like to see the film with Nelson's 
hilarious commentary track. 

This is an excellent idea, but 
why should "Reefer Madness" 
selfishly reap aU of the benefits? 
With the season of summer block-
busters soon upon us, Nelson's 
commentary tracks should be an 
option for audiences of all upcom-
ing films. After all, what other rea-
son could you possibly have to 
attend a film like "Scooby-Doo 2" 
or "The Passion of the Christ," if 
not to hear the savage yet sage 
commentary of a certain Michael 
J. Nelson? Come on, nobody is 
paying attention to Jesus' dialogue 
anyway ...

Weed' like to know about grass 
The effects of marijuana vary for each person 

By HANS FELLMANN 
Contributing Writer 

Whether you're a habitual pot 
smoker, a once-a-month user or 
just a curious student, having clear 
infonnation about the drug you're 
putting in your body is always 
important. Marijuana, although 
less potent than some of the more 
serious drugs, can still have con-
siderable effects on both mind and 
body. Many uninformed students 
who are curious about smoking 
pot never really talee the time to 
research its effects. More often 
than not, the outcome isn't drastic, 
but the resulting experiences can 
leave students wondering, "What 
the hell just happened to me?" 

According to Debbie Pino-
Saba lett, director of health educa-
tion at Student Health Services, 
marijuana's active ingredient 
THC (tetrahydracannabinol) 
could cause those who smoke it to 
experience some of the following 
common side effects: slowed 
reflexes, mild elation, paranoia or 
anxiety, reduced shon-term mem-
ory, laziness, poor depth percep-
tion, enhanced senses, faster 
pulse, dry mouth, redness of eyes, 
heightened humor or talkativeness 
and increased appetite. 

The mc in marijuana has 
these effects on people because, 
after two to three uses, it starts to 
bind with natural cannabinoid 
receptors in certain areas of the 
brain. These include areas involved 
in pleasure, thought, concentra-
tion, coordination, sensory percep-
tion and short-term memory. 

Many students who have used 
marijuana have similar stories that 

corresponded more or less with 
what the medical experts had to 
say. For most srudents, it took two 
to three times for pot to give them 
any sort of high. Once they 
achieved that high, the general 
feeling was euphoric at first, com-
bined with tendencies to either 
socialize with others, laugh, think 
deeply, or simply "veg out" in 
front of the television while eating 
chocolate ice cream. 

Some students claim to have 
experienced the proverbial "bad 
trip," which, according to medical 
experts, is a long bout of paranoia 
coupled with anxiety and obses-
sive thoughts, usually related to 
the fear of getting caught while 
being high. 

Peter, a Revelle College junior, 
had his own explanation of a "bad' 
trip. " 

"If you have a bad trip because 
of paranoia while being high, it's 
because of your own insecurities, 
not the pot," he said. "The pot 
simply lifts your mental blocks 
and makes you aware of your inse-
curities and you get paranoid that 
people will see you for who you 
really are. So fix your issues before 
you smoke it." 

There were a few others who 
also disagreed with what doctors 
have to say about pot. Tim, an 
Earl Warren College senior, 
claimed to have smoked pot 10 to 
15 times before he ever felt the 
effects of it. 

Danny, also a Warren senior, 
claimed that he developed a 
reverse tolerance to pot and was 
able to get high quicker by smok-
ing less because he learned "just 
how to smoke it." In addition, he 

felt he had the opposite of the typ-
ical reaction. 

"1 felt pot increased my atten-
tion span, as opposed to making me 
lazy, by allowing me to focus on just 
my homework. 1 was able to finish 
it more quickly that way," he said. 

On rare occasions, people have 
had extreme responses to the sub-
stance, including entirely impaired 
judgment, temporary loss of reali-
ty and severe panic attacks. 

Paul, a Sixth College freshman, 
said he got so high that he lost all 
his judgment and his friends were 
able to convince him of almost 
anything. They told him he was a 
bird and coaxed him into jumping 
into the icy waters of a bay. He 
said he climbed out, soaked to the 
bone, muttering profunities. 

Jenna, a Sixth College fres~­
man, said she smoked pot with her 
friends, and in their heightened 
state, they decided to play "Mario 
Brothers." Not the video game, but 
actually play "Mario Brothers." 
She was Princess Toadstool, and 
her other friends were Mario, 
Luigi and Toad. After establishing 
who was who, they spent their 
entire evening jumping from rock 
to rock at the local creek, slaying 
tree monsters so they could make it 
to different levels. 

Jason, an Eleanor Roosevelt 
College senior, said he was unaware 
of how powerful marijuana was, 
and decided to consume a lot of pot 
brownies with a friend one night. 
The student was fine for a while, 
but suddenly his hean started rac-
ing beyond control and he was sent 
into a horrible panic attack. He

Michael J. Nelson's 
thoughts o~ pot 

Writer gives commentary 
track on 'Reefer Madness' 

By IRIAN UIGA 
Staff Writer 

Mike Nelson was the host and 
head writer of "Mystery Science 
Theater 3000" during most of the 
show's 10-year run. Since then, he 
has kept himself busy penning 
three books, contributing his com-
ments to cinematic gems such as 
"Reefer Madness," and generally 
establishing himself as King of the 
Bad Movies. 

GrumIiII,,: How did you land the 
assignment with Legend Films to 
do the commentary track for 
"Reefer Madness"? 

Mike Nelson: It's my first opportu-
nity taking advantage of nepotism. 
David Martin of Legend Films is a 
friend of a friend who thought of me 
when he took on "Reefer." Why? I 
should probably ponder that. 

G: I've heard rumors about you 
providing some similar commen-
tary with Bill Corbett and Kevin 
Murphy for some upcoming 
"Three Stooges" DVDs, as well as 
flying solo for some wmbie films . 

Nelson: It's true. Kevin, Bill and I 
did some goofy sruff for their 

upcoming "Stooges" release. I have 
also contributed commentary for 
"Carnival of Souls" and" ight of 
the Living Dead." Bill, Kevin and I 
are also working on a book togeth-
er. No release date yet, but it's the 
heartbreaking tale of a young boy 
coming of age in a sma ll ebraska 
town. Wait, no - it's a wacky 
instructional book on how to enjoy 
really bad DVDs and the really bad 
extras that often accompany them. 

G: You've been quite the author 
lately. Your latest, "Death Rat," has 
been likened to Douglas Adams' 
"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" 
with a few less space stations. If 
"Death Rat" is successful enough, 
can we look forward to some more 
fiction from you? 

Nelson: I'm sure I will revisit fic-
tion, as there are so many more 
rodents out there around which to 
base a book.. I'd also like to try my 
hand at a pulp thriller. Seriously. 
Having read my first one on a 
recent vacation, and realizing that 
one needn't necessarily write good 
prose, [ think I could pull it off. 

G: In your commentary you men-

Mary Jane: Films are no 
longer just saying no to drugs 

co~rinued from page 10 
during this period that marijuana 
was portrayed opcnly in films as a 
peaceful and even enlightening nat-
ural substance. 

"I Love You, Alice B. Toklas" is 
a charming comedy focusing on the 
mid-life crisis of the main charac-
ter, played by Peter SeUers. He 
meets a sweet flower child and is 
introduced to the hippie world. 
Marijuana is an entirely positive 
force in this film; everyone who 
uses it (even unwittingly, like 
Sellers' aging parents) emerges 
more thoughtful, aware, sponta-
neous and free. One is hard-pressed 
to find films in any of the other his-
torical periods that portray pot in 
such a benevolent light. Even 
Cheech and Chong are shown to 
be, at best, dull-witted and slow. 

Interestingly, certain stereotyp-
ical companions of marijuana, 
such as sexuality, continued 
through this period. The correla-
tion of marijuana to sexual promis-
cuity is best demonstrated in Russ 
Meyer's now infamous, "Beyond 
the Valley of the Dolls" (1970). In 
the opening scene, we see the main 
characters smoke a joint and 
immediately begin having sex. 
Throughout the film, getting 
stoned is the excuse behind 
"deviant" sexual behavior. 

Looking at films in the 1980s, 
it is apparent that Nancy Reagan 's 
"Just Say No" campaign seems to 
have been successful. Films during 
this period show that drug use of 
any kind leads to the inevitable 
decline of the character's moral 
stature. In fitms such as "Clean 
and Sober" (1988), the main char-
acter is given a choice, drugs or 
death. Hollywood returned to its 
pre-'60s artitude of showing drugs 
only in a negative light. The usual 
mainstay of marijuana representa-
tion, the teen flick, also seemed to 
be in a curious state of absti nence. 
Compare the heroes of 1982's 
"Fast Times at Ridgemont High" 
to 1989's "Bill and Ted's Excellent 

Adventure." In "Fast Times," 
Spicolli, played by a young Sean 
Penn, is the lovable if irresponsi-
ble surfer hero. Even in the epi-
logue, he is given the honor of 
saving Brooke Shields from 
drowning. Spicolli and his friends 
happily toke their way through 
high school with no ill effects. 
"Bill and Ted," on the other hand, 
shows two portrayals of the "ston-
er" personality, but there is a con-
spicuous absence of any drug, 
alcohol or even cigarette use. 
Marijuana, having been an icon of 
youth rebellion for decades, was 
quickly snuffed out with a simple 
"no, thank you." 

It was in the 1990s that pot real-
ly started being portrayed as a 
social drug in films. Gone were the 
days of "you're going to hell" if 
you smoked. Films stopped com-
menting on the ethks of marijuana 
use. They started showing it for 
what most of society really uses it 
for - a social drug. "Dazed and 
Confused" (1993), "True 
Romance" (1993) and "Rea li ty 
Bites" (1994) are ' interesting 
because they all involve pot smok-
ing, but did not simply focus on the 
morality of the drug. It was per-
haps the first time since the 1960s 
that marijuana was portrayed so 
casually. None of the characters 
were addkted, harmed or led to 
harder drugs on account of their 
marijuana use. Instead, the smok-
ing was portrayed in the same off-
hand manner as cigarerte and alco-
hol consumption had been during 
the 1950s. 

These days, marijuana is every-
where in films. From Diego Luna 
and Gael Garcia Bernal puffing it 
continually in "Y Tu Mama 
Tambien" (2001), to suggestions of 
it in "The Eternal Sunshine of the 
Spotless Mind" (2004), it is hard to 
watch a movie that docs not make 
some sort of reference to marijua-
na. The film industry realized tl1at 
marijuana use can be like the new 
cocktail hour.

Nelson: King of mockery 
lends voice to 'Reefer' DVD

Billy Gil 
If you looked at my record col-

lection, you'd probably think I do 
some son of drug. I don't. But in 
the spirit of 4120, I have decided 
to dispense of my musical knowl-
edge in the debatable topic of 
"drug music." 

First of all , what constirutes 
drug music? I don't do any heavy 
drugs or smoke (well, often), but 
I'll keep weed in mind. This 
means that pulsating beats, repeti-
tive musical themes, exotic instru-
mentation and absurdist lyrics 
constitute classifying factors, 
regardless of genre. It should also 
be notcd that, by and large, the 
music is enjoyable even when 
you're nor high, though it doesn't 
hurt to be. 

Starting way back with 
dinosaur rock, there's some neces-
sary obvious choices: the sludgy 
proto-metal of Black Sabbath, 
especially P,mmoidj any Led 
Zeppelin, but especially the Frodo 
Baggins-rock 'n roll of Ltd 
Ztpptlin IVj Love's psychedelic-
folk masterpiece Forrotr Changes; 
the Nuggets garage-rock box set; 
and, of course, every album by me 
Velvet Underground and Pink 
Floyd. 

The 1970s produced many a 
drug-influenced artist. In terms of 
me loopy, trance-inducing music 
we want to discuss here, German 
artists like Can and Kraftwerk 
were massively influential to elec-
tronica and art-rock alike, and 
their music is great to get high to. 

There are plenty of lesser-
known choices from the '80s and 
'90s mat can also do the trick. The 
"Big Sonic Chill" variety can work 
navel-gazing wonders, particularly 
anything by mystical dream-pop-
pers Cocteau Twins and My 
Bloody Valentine's ever-acclaimed 

touchstone, "Loveless." 
The '80s "Madchester" scene 

in the United Kingdom produced 
the excellently trippy self-titled 
Stone Roses album, and drone-
rockers Spacemen 3 made an 
album called Taltmg Dn4gs to Maltt 
Music to Taitt Dn4gs To. 

In the '90s, the atmospheric 
joys of indie-rockers like Yo La 
Tengo, Spritualized, Stereolab 
and Tortoise should keep things 
nice and smooth. 

" Yau might say to your ~ 
self, where's Sublime?

Stoner music doesn't 

have to suck; in fact, the 
qualities that 

render much of this 
. , . , 

musIC stoner musIC are 
what make it com~ 

pelling." 
Some genres have inherent 

drugginess. Most electronica 
music fits the bill. There's the jun-
gle madness of Roni Size & 
Reprazent's Nw Forms, the novel 
ambient breakbeat'of DJ Shadows 
Endtrodudng, the "intelligent 
dance music" (either IDM or 
"stoner music" for short) of Aphex 
Twin and Boards of Canada, and 
the moody trip-hop of Massive 
Attack and Portishead are all rec-
ommenda tions. 

When you think of stonery 
hip-hop, the bud-referencing Dr. 
Dre, Snoop and Cypress Hill of 
course come to mind. Much of 
their work, however, is too pop-
oriented - it'll grab your atten-
tion (which is the problem with

including most pop music on this 
list, while we're at it). Better is the 
early '90s psychedelic hip-hop of 
the Pharcyde, De La Soul and vet-
eran collective the Wu Tang Clan. 
I've also been informed by a reli-
able source that I am not "in the 
Icnow" if! don't mention "I Got 5 
on It" by Luniz. 

How about reggae? One rec-
ommendation: Dub Side of the 
Moon, a compilation of various 
dub reggae artists covering Pink 
Floyd's Dllrlt Side of the Moon, 
obviously one of the all-time great 
albums to get stoned to, 

There's plenty of new music 
Out there that should tickle the 
post-millennial stoner in you, 
Anything by Sigur Ros, 
Radiohead's Kid A, The Flaming 
Lips' Yoshimi Batt/u the Pinlt 
Robots and Queens of the Stone 
Ages Songs for tht Deaf are mod-
ern stoner masterpieces. Four 
Tet keeps the brainy IDM flag 
flying, and ·Air and Zero 7 con-
tinue to make sexy ambient pop 
that you can do more than JUSt 
smoke to. Black Rebel 
Motorcycle Club cough up the 
dirty noise-rock of the Jesus and 
Mary Chain, and the Wallcmen 
sound like a languid Strokes after 
many, many hits. Blackalicious, 
Cee-Lo and certain OutKast 
songs fit the bill for experimen-
ully-damaged art-rap. In addi-
tion, "Almost the Same" by Brit-
poppers Clearlalce, with its heav-
ing guitars and unwavering beat, 
is the best stoner pop song in 
recent memory. . 

You might say to yourself, 
when:'s Sublime? Phish? 
Afroman? Piss off, that shit sucks. 
Stoner music doesn't have to suckj 
in fact, the qualities that render 
much of this music "stoner music" 
are what make it compelling. Even 
if you don't subscribe to this 4120 
nonsense, I promise that any of 
these suggestions would make a 
fine addition to your stonerless 
catalogue. So whip up some 
brownies (check out the recipe on 
page 14) and get ready to mellow 
out to some great music.

tion that you didn't have an "exten-
sive Icnowledge of reefer," but have 
you had any personal experiences 
with the "demon weed"? 

Nelson: Last summer, I amused a 
studio audience for the now-failed 
Jesse Ventura talk show by admit-
ting, under questioning from the 
former feather-baa-wearing gover-
nor, that I had neither smoked 
marijuana nor had I ever gone skin-
ny dipping. My life is a catalog of 
ordinariness. 

G: So what do you think of mari-
juana then? 

Nelson: 1 tried to argue with the 
pro-drug Ventura. I'm against mar-
ijuana use largely because of the 
quality of people I see it producing. 
Tommy Chong - this is someone 
to look up to? That guy married to 
Goldie Hawn's daughter? As a 
spokesman for weed, he leaves 
something to be desired. Woody 
Harrelson? If marijuana users had a 
person of say, Winston Churchill's 
caliber on their side, I might be 
more inclined to listen. Truth be 
told, it's an extremely complex 
issue and I have to admit that I 
don't have a fully coherent argu-
ment concerning U.S. policy. I just 
Icnow that my own view is that 
marijuana use is just, well, cheesy. 
G: Why do you think that a 1938 
propaganda 61m about the evils of 

marijuana has survived for 65 years? 
Nelson: I know it makes pot 
smokers laugh a lot. But then, 
what doesn't? But really, it's sur-
vived mostly because it's a really, 
really goofy movie - weed or no 
weed. The reason it's laughed at 
today is, in my opinion, different 
from the reason it was originally 
laughed at. Back in the 1960s, 
every opinion of anyone in 
"authority," essentially "adults," 
was considered suspect. The film's 
obvious untruths about marijuana 
- I wouldn't say they were lies, 
because it's tough to know if they 
acrually believed what they were 
saying - only confirmed this 
point of view. But now, after hav-
ing seen the wreckage that whole-
sale drug use wrought upon the 
1960s generation, I believe viewers 
aren't snickering so much at the 
central message, but rather the 
bizarre nature of the film itself. 

G: If the "Reefer Madness" DVD 
is successful enough, you may sun 
a trend of Mike Nelson commen-
tary tracks included on DVDs. 
What recent DVD releases do you 
think are worrhy of the full treat-
ment? 

Nelson: I want to do the re-release 
of "CocIctaiI." It~ such a beautiful 
'80s time capsule, in much me same 
way that "Reefer" is of its time. Also, 
"Coyote Ugly." Just don't make me 
sit through "Battlefield Earth."

called the ambulance. After putting 
him through a series of medical 
examinations, he said, the medics 
determined he was OK and left 
shortly thereafter. The student was 
able to relax after the whole episode 
and, luckily for him, his parents 
never woke up. 

These extreme cases (if they're 

true) shouldn't be feared if you're 
considering smoking pot for the 
first time, but they should prove a 
point: Everybody reacts differently 
to the drug. Chances are you won't 
even get high the first time you try 
it. Nevertheless, if you're going to 
experiment with marijuana, it's 
always helpful to know it before 
you toke it.

Does smoking marijuana really 
affect your sexual performance? 

~ I COOKING CORNER 
Raise the temperature with pot 

brownies to celebrate 4/20 this year to your 
health 

Neha Singh 
Wall pot affect my sexual 

performance? 
- C.J.. ReveUe CoUege 

Mter taking a few hits. people 
might nO! have any qualms about 
having sex. Since smoking POt 
makes many people very happy 
and relaxed. some people believe 
that using it will enable them to 
have better sex with fewer inhibi-
tions ... or will it? 

"When you think about what 
pot does. you can classify it as a 
type of central nervous system 
depressant," Dr. Brad Buchman, 
director of clinical services at 
Student Health Services, said. 
"Since its initial effects for most 
people are feelings of calmness, 
sedation and euphoria, you might 
feel that a small amount of mari-
juana might be good for sex, or 
getting in the mood for sex, but 
you should realize that it's effect 
on sex will be pretty serious - it 
will actually start to dampen sexu-
al response and function ." 

If you're trying to have sex 
while stoned, you might be in for 
some surprises (some of which 
are pretty embarrassing). Since 

pot is a depressant, it can drasti-
cally diminish your ability to per-
form in bed. 
. "It is harder for both men and 

women to get excited physically 
while under the influence of pot, " 
Buchman said. "If a guy gets 
stoned enough, he might not even 
be able to get an erection. Or, he 
might be able to get an erection, 
have intercourse, but not have an 
orgasm. The parallel has to be true 

" It is a real. possibility that you might just pass out 
during intercourse. " 

- Dr. BrIel BuchmIn, 
Student Health Services 

for females. If you really crank up 
the dose of POt, you might not 
even have any sex 'at all. It is a real 
possibility that you might just pass 
out during intercourse. It is hard 
for you to even feel what is hap-
pening to your body. In many 
cases, you probably won't even 
clearly remember what happened 
the next day." 

So much for "doing it" while 
high. The upside is that if one 
partner is stoned enough, hope-
fully they won't remember that 
the other fell asleep midway 

through intercourse last night 
anyway. And a guy can only pray 
that the girl is too stoned to _ 
remember the next morning that 
he couldn't "get it up." 

Maybe we should learn some-
thing from our South American 
neighbors. 

"When I was in college, I 
went to Brazil with a friend of 
mine," Buchman said. "People 
there rarely smoke pot or drink 
alcohol. That culture really push-
es drug use down; they are really 
into sex, and they don't want any 
suppression of their libido, per-
formance or orgasms. Of course, 
many people here in the [United) 
States use Pot to relax them and 
not make them so nervous. It is a 
cultural part of dating since it 
does drop people's inhibitions to 
a cenain extent. True, th.ey might 
not be as tense, but they should 
realize that it will have a very 
negative effect on their sexual 
performance. " 

In a nutshell, that is the reali-
ty. All the other added frills like 
feeling loose are a part of one's 
perception, which is also altered 
by marijuana. Clearly, it is going 
to impair one's physiological 
response to sex at even low doses . 
It might be wiser to not light up 
before sex.

No. 29 baseball up 2-1 in crucial CCAA series 
Tritons split against PLNU then win doubleheader 

Tennis: 
Chopra 

returns to the 
starting lineup 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

A 7 -4 victory over crosstown 
rival Point Lorna azarene at 
Triton Baseball Stadium on April 
7 restored the No. 29 Tritons' 
place in the national Division II 
rankings. However, the victory 
was short-lived as the Sea Lions 
retaliated on April 14 and defeat-
ed UCSD at Carroll B. Land 
Stadium in Point Lorna, Calif., in 
a 4-6 contest. 

The Tritons then left for San 
Francisco on April 16, where 
they dropped the opener of a 
four-game series against San 
Francisco State, 3-1, before com-
ing back to win both ends of a 
doubleheader against the Gators, 
13-2 and 1-0. Game four had not 
been completed at press time. 

Now, with only nine games 
remaining in regular-season play, 
victories are more crucial than 
ever. Before the series, UCSD 
and San Franciso State had iden-
tical 15-3 records in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association conference and were 
tied for fifth place in the stand-
ings. Only the top-four teams in 
the conference advance to the 
playoffs. Though UC Davis leads 
the CCM, its ineligibility for 
postseason play due to its uansi-
tion to Division ( allows UCSD 
and San Franciso State to fight 
for sole possession of the final 
playoff spot. The next two weeks 
of games will decide the Tritons' 
fate . 

In the series opener, UCSD 
held tightly to a one-run lead 
through eight and a half innings, 
but the Gators tied the game in 
the bottom half of the eighth with 
a home run from SFSU shortstop 
A.j. Biama. Thc G alors closed the 

game with two more runs in the 
bottom of the ninth off of it two-
run home run from rightfielder 
Shane Stover. 

Triton sophomore pitcher Jose 
avarro went eight innings, giv-

ing up just one run on five hits and 
striking out six. UCSD sopho-
more reliever Ryan Leake took the 
loss for the Tritons, and his record 
fell to 5-2 on the year. 

The outcome was a bit differ-
ent in the doubleheader on April 
17 against the Gators, as the 
Tritons won both decisions, 13-2 
and 1-0. 

UCSD junior hurler Logan 
Boutilier started on the mound in 
game one, going seven innings and 
allowing seven hits, one earned 
run and one walk, while striking 
out three. He improved to S-2 
with the win. Senior pitcher 
Nolan Dunlcly and junior pitcher 
Tyler Smith each threw one clean 
inning with one strikeout apiece to 
close the Gators out. 

Offensively, the Tritons broke 
open a 1- 1 game with two runs in 
the third inning, a pair in the fifth 
and another run in the sixth. 
UCSD broke the game wide open 
with a five-run seventh inning and 
twO more runs in the eighth 
frame. 

Junior second , baseman Ricky 
Pinocchio, the leadoff batter for 
UCSD, went 3-for-4 with four 
runs scored. He also was hit by a 
pitch twice and stole a base. 
Pinocchio reached base to begin 
the first, third and fifth innings, 
and successfully scored each time. 
He safely reached base all seven 
times he went to the plate, capital-
izing on a fielding error in the sev-
enth inning. 

Triton junior shortstop Keith 
Hernandez added three hits on 
five at-bats, to go with two RBI

and a run scored. Senior center-
fielder Brett Burton was 2-for-3 
with a double, two RBI and two 
runs scored. Junior third baseman 
Alex Gascon, senior first baseman 
Keith Albrecht and junior R)'2n 
Langone drove in two runs 
apiece. 

Langone and senior catcher 
Jeff Riddle each scored two runs. 
Langone had a two-run triple in 
the five-run seventh inning while 
Albrecht provided a two-run dou-
ble in the eighth. 

UCSD sophomore starter 
Byron Grubman tossed his first 
collegiate shutout in the nightcap, 
de.live.ring all seven innings plus 
the extra inning of the abbreviated 
game. Grubman, now 4-3, has 
earned all of his wins in complete 
games. He has eight complete 
games over his two seasons at 
UCSD. San Franciso State man-
aged just four singles and a walk 
off of Grubman, and 'was retired 
on strilees six times. 

All five of the Tritons' hits 

were singles. In the eighth 
inning, Hernandez singled with 
one out after Albrecht, who 
earned the win April 16, came 
into the game on the mound to 
start the frame. Hernandez 
advanced to second when Riddle 
drew a walk, and moved to third 
on a wild pitch. Albrecht's single 
to right-center brought 
Hernandez home, and Grubman 
retired the side in order in the 
bottom half of the inning. 

The Gators fell to 2S-21 over-
all and 16-15 in league play. 
UCSD improves to 28-18 overall 
and 17- 14intheCCAA. 

With two more weeks left in 
the regular season, the Tritons will 
have to keep playing solid baseball 
to guarantee a playoff spot. 
UCSD's penultimate matchup will 
be against the always sttong Chico 
State on April 23 through April 
2S. The series will be played at 
Triton Baseball Stadium in what 
will be the 2004 UCSD baseball 
team's final home stand.

our strengths." 

On April 16, UCSD maintained 
their competitive play by blanking 
Sonoma State, 9-0, in a California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
matchup in Rohnert Parle, Calif. 

In doubles, Chopra and 
Wilson defeated Patrick Nagle 
and Thomas Morten, 8-5, at No. 
1 doubles. At No.2, Nejad and 
Swatt defeated Matt Parker and 
Phil Taylor, 8-4. Rounding out 
the doubles sweep were Morton 
and Molden with their 8-S win 
over Andrew Laing and Ronnie 
Tuttle. 

In singles, the Tritons contin-
ued their solid play, winning all six 
matches in straight sets. Chopra, 
Swart, Wilson, Novak, Molden and 
Nejad each recorded a singles vic-
tory for the day. 

On April 17, UCSD finished 
off their road trip with a 5-0 vic-
tory against UC Davis. Due to 
rain, the match against UC Davis 
was shortened after the Tritons 
clinched the fifth point of the dual 
match. 

The Tritons easily took doubles 
to put the Aggies at an early 3-0 
deficit. At No. 1 singles, Swatt beat 
Jayce Fitch in straight sets, 6-1, 6-
3, and Molden cruised past Ross 
Barasch, 6-0, 6-4, before the rain 
suspended the other matches. With 
UCSD already securing the victoty 
at 5-0, Wilson, Novak, Nejad and 
Spector did not finish their singles 
matches. 

The Tritons play their final 
match of the season on the road 
against UC Riverside on April 19 
in Riverside, Calif., at 2 p.m. 

Women's water polo drops Harper Cup to San Diego State 
Tritons prepare to enter WWPA tournament seeded at No.2 

By DANIEL DiAl 
Senior Staff Writer 

The seniors of UCSD women 's 
water polo team gave their farewell 
performance lO fans at Canyon view 
Pool in the third annual Harper 
Cup on April 16. UCSD managed a 
couple of inspired charges but were 
unable to bring home the bacon in 
a 9-4 10 s to crosstown foe San 
Diego State. 

Emotions ran high among the 
four seniors who were acknowledged 
with pre-game flowers and hugs, 
while the rest of the Tritons faced an 
Aztec squad that was low on senti-
ment and high on swift attacking. 
Within two minutes of the opening 
whistle, Holly Hartzell struck from 
the hole in successive possessions to 
give San Diego State an advantage 
that would grow as high as 9-2 by 
the end of the third period. 

The loss was the third consecu-
tive Harper Cup disappointment for 
the Tritons, who remain in second 
place in the Western Water Polo 
Association with a 12-17 record. 
The Aztecs now hold a 27-6 head-
to-head margin against the Tritons. 

"We were not ready to go," said 
UCSD senior goalie Stephanie 
Lombardo, who picked up three 
saves. "We didn't warm up, and 
maybe the first 30 seconds it was 
very emotional, then I got scored on 
and then ( realized 'Whoa, its still 
polo' ... it had a sobering effect." 

Hartzell had another goal 
before the end of the half on her 
way lO earning the Harper Cup 
MVP award. Dominique Delgado 
and Sandy Onweller were potent as 
Hartzell's drivers, each hitting a 
pair. 

The Aztecs had plenty of success 
firing from two-meters in the first 
half, with Delgado hitting her shots 
from a sharp angle just beyond the 
right post. San Diego State's goals in 
the second half didn't come without 
a little good fortune. UCSD junior 
driver Courtney Clevenger was aU 
over Savannah Kelly, but the shot 
squeezed through her outstretched 
arms. Onweller fired a shot that was 
blocked by Lombardo, but eventual-
ly crawled its way-into the goal.

sputtering attack that drew nine 
ejections, including two, rare six-on-
four man-ups, yet only converted 
one of those advantages. The 
Tritons also had 11 turnovers in the 
contest, putting the pressure solely 
on the shoulders of their defense. 

The crowd got to its feet when 
Clevenger drew a four-meter 
penalty shot with only 0.9 seconds 
left in the third period; however, all 
that amounted was a bounce off the 
crossbar and another rebound for 
the Aztecs. 

"(San Diego] State just brought 
the intensity. We backed off and 
weren't on our legs or executing," 
Bantilan-Smith said. 

UCSD still managed to find 
some spark in the midst of the frus-
uating effort. Early in the second 
quarter after Delgado's second goal 
of the match, Clevenger took a pass 
at mid-pool from Stephanie 
Lombardo and swam at a cautious 
pace toward her defender. 

As her defender backed off, 
Clevenger calmly tossed a lob from 
eight meters out past beaten Aztec 
goaltender Ashley Zabel to cut San 
Diego State's lead in half, 4-2. 

Later, Bantilan-Smith redeemed 
the penalty shot mishap by bounc-
ing a shot in the lower left corner of 
the cage after drawing a four-meter 
shot of her own. 

Sophomore driver Flynn 
LaRochelle took a quick pass with 
less than 40 seconds left and put 
one past Zabel to give the game its 
final scoreline and send the crowd 
to its feet. 

The intensity displayed in the 
final goal was the spark of energy 
that the Tritons had been looking

for in the game and throughout the 
season. The brief flashes left many 
wanting more. 

Amid the frustration, however, 
the Tritons found a little time to 
brighten their spirits. As the shot 
clock ran down late in the game, 
junior two-meter defender 
Lindsay Grossman, trapped in the 
near corner by her defender, 
pumped inside as if she was going 
to pass, then tossed the ball out-
side, forcing her defender to chase 
after the ball, drawing laughter 
from the bench. 

Despite failing to earn the 
Harper Cup for the third consecu-
tive year, the women didn't seem 
too disappointed. 

Mens water polo coach Denny 
Harper, for whom the tournament is 

dedicated, coached both UCSD 
head coach Larry Sanders and San 
Diego State head coach Carin 
Crawford at UCSD and captured 
five women's national titles from 
1985 through 1999. 

"We do have a rivalry with [San 
Diego] State because they're the 
crosstown school, but they're not in 
our conference, they're not Loyola 
Marymount or UC Davis; we'd 
rather beat them than State," 
Lombardo said. 

1be Tritons round out their reg-
ular season at the Long Beach 
Invitational on April 17 and April 18

Mettee, who had walked. The 
Tritons struck once more for 
another run in the sixth, when 
senior second baseman Kim 
Aggabao singled to bring in 
Mettee, who had doubled. 

Freshman starter Tina Rowe 
went the distance, getting her 

. ninth win of the season and her 
second shutout, bringing her 
record up to 9-S. In addition, 
Rowe only allowed four hits and 
one walk in seven innings with 
two strikeouts. 

In the second game on April 16, 
UCSD started it off much the same 
as the opening game, utilizing mul-
tiple homers to sink the Coyotes. 
This time, they were fired back to 
back, with the first coming off the 
bat of Franciscus, her fourth of the 
season and second of the day, and 
the following blast coming from 
the next batter, Agpbao, her sec-
ond of the year. 

In the third inning, Franciscus 

gOt a double, and after being 
advanced to third on a sacrifice, 
scored on a single by Hurst. In the 
fourth inning, sophomore right 
fielder Niki Anderson got things 
staned with a walk, and then stole 
second. Menee then knocked a sin-
gle, bringing in Anderson and 
putting the score at 4-0. 

The Coyotes managed to get on 
the board in the fifth inning, scor-
ing once, but that was the sum of 
the Cal State San Bernardino 
offense. In the sixth, Menee once 
again scored Andenon, this time 
on a sacrifice By. 

Senior starter Jo!lie Bland threw 
a complete game, only giving up 
one earned run. She brought her 
record up to 12-10 for the year. 

UCSD has 29 home runs this 
season, surpassing the school 
record of 14. 

UCSD was scheduled to play a 
doubleheader against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on April 17, but 
the game was postponed due to rain.

Classic, our stroke rating was 
around 33 to 34 [strokes per

Championships, we were up to 35 
or 36. 

The men's junior varsity eight 
outstrolced two San Diego State 
boats by several lengths, taking 
only 6:31 .65 to complete the 2,000-
meter course and leaving the first 
Aztec eight almost a full 10 seconds 
in the wake at 6:41.27. The second 
SDSU boat crossed the finish line 
more than half • minute later at 
7:07.11. 

Even the Triton men's novice 
eight boat handled the rinl compe-
tition completely, dismissing the 
Aztec novice boat by more than 10 
seconds in a 6:49.29-to-7 :00.36 
race. 

The varsity four race was the 
second challenge of the day for 
many UCSD rowers, who were 
also entered in the earlier, varsity 
eight competition. 

"We were happy, especially in 
the fours, where people were dou-

bling up and winning some close 
races," Davis said. 

UCSD edged out San Diego 
State by barely two seconds in the 
smaller boat, finishing in 7:01.1,

In the final mens race of the 
morning, the UCSD novice four 
boat beat San Diego State by less 
than one second in 7:28.35 to the 
Aztec 7:29.01. 

The City · Championships 
marked the second of three crucial 

events in the Tritons' 2004 season, 
the fint being the April 4 San 
Diego Crew Classic, where the 
Tritons finished third in the Grand 
Finals. The final test of the Tritons' 
abilities under Davis will take place 
May 1 and May 2 at the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Association 
Championships on Lake Natoma. 
UCSD will vie for a medal against 
the nation's best rowing schools. 

"We are a potential top-three 
team in WIRA, but where - 1

can race with anybody." 

Prior to' the WIRA 
Championship, UCSD win travel 
to the Newport Invitational on 
April 2 S to round out the regular 
season in Newpon Harbor, Calif. 

"We are right where we need to 
be," Hardeman said. "The team is 
going after Orange Coast College, 
because the Crew Classic wasn't 
our best race of the season, and 
they beat us there. We are working 
hard to beat them." 

Orange Coast beat the Tritons 
by nine seconds at the San Diego 
Crew Classic.

came out victorious both times 
with 6-3 and 9-0 wins, respectively. 

On April 18, the Tritons came 
out ready and fighting. At No. 2 
doubles, Tara Siddiqui and Kristin 
Brooowicki defeated their oppo-
nents with a quick and easy 8-2 
win. At No. 3 doubles, UCSD's sis-
ters Allison and Jenna Ishii battled 
hard against Silvana Stans and 
Phoebe Bachofer to pull away and 
win, 8-4. 

The Tritons' No. 1 doubles had 
a much harder time against their 
opponents, Charise Godoy and 
Ronalyn Miller. The match began 
with a series of unforced errors on 
UCSD's part, but relying on Julie 
Westerman's hard-hitting serves 
and Jasmin Dao's wide range of 
shots, the duo was able to come 
back from being down 4-5 to come 
out victorious. Dao ended the 
match with a hard hit overhead to 
make the final score 8-6. 

"We came out a bit nervous," 
Dao said. "But Julie and I have 
been playing together all year so we 
feed off each other's energy. We've 
played against these opponents 
before and they are a good team." 

The victorious doubles lineup 
made the match even easier going 
into singles with a 3-0 lead. 

The Tritons' doubles lineup has 
definitely come a long way since 
the beginning of the season. 

"I would like to give TImmer 
WiDi"" our assistant coach, a lot 
of credit, " head coach Liz LaPlante 
said. -It's only his second year 

coaching and he's been working 
with our girls on doubles. He's def-
initely improved our doubles 
lineup and made it stronger than 
ever before." 

With a 3-0 lead, the Tritons 
only needed two more wins to seal 
a conference championship. No. 5 
singles MariS$a Hilker and No. 6 
Jansen each came out with quick 6-
0, 6-0 victories to give UCSD the 
win. Once the Tritons bagged the 
win, the rest of the matches were 
called off. I 

AL No.1, Westerman was los-
ing to her opponent 0-6, 1-2 and at 
No.2, Dao had just finished off'her 
first set, 6-1, and was tied, I-I, in 
the second. Siddiqui, who played 
No.3, was losing, 3-S, and Leigh 
Roberts was ahead, 6-1, 4-0, at ljIo. 
4 singles. 

"We had come out expectini a 
win because we've played [<1:al 
State) LA before, but they're a 
great team and have come a long 
way this year," Jansen said. 

On April 16, the Thtons faced 
Sonoma State in the semifinals and 
came out victorious, 5-1. 

"Everyone played well; we came 
out a bit nervous ·at first," LaPlante 
said. "But after a while, we just Set-
ded in and played like we could." 

Weltennan and Dao had no 
trouble defeating their opponents, 
8-3, at No. 1 doubles, and the Ishii 
sisters defeated Katie Murphy and 
Kim CouIIOIl in a quick 8-1 match. 
But No. 2 doubles Siddiqui and 
Bronowicki had a much harder 
time with their opponents and lost 

a close 6-8 match against Kelly 
Murphy and Gina Dunch. 

Going into the singles lineup, 
UCSD was leading, 2-1, but three 
quick matches from No.3 Siddiqui, 
No. 4 Roberts and No.6 freshman 
Katie McKee brought home the 
semifinal win. Siddiqui defeated 
her opponent, 6-1, 6-1, and 
Roberts double goose-egged her 
opponent, 6-0, 6-0. McKee played 
the great tennis she's been playing 
all season and defeated her oppo-
nent, 6-1, 6-3. 

Westerman had just finished off 
her first set, 7-5, and both Dao and 
Hilker were on the verge of win-
ning their matches, 6-3, 5-0 and 6-
4, 5-4, respectively, when the game 
was called. 

"It was [UC] Davis two years 
ago and Cal Poly Pomona last year 
who defeated us in the champi-
onships, so it was nice to finally 
win," LaPlante said. "This has been 
our goal all season, and it feels 
great to finally get it. 

In two weeks, the girls will 
either head to Hawaii or host a 
match at UCSD for regionals. The 
seeding for regionals has not been 
set, but the Tritons are expecting to 
be seeded third. 

"In these next two weeks, we're 
just going to be working on fine-
tuning everyone's game." LaPlante 
said. "It all just comes down to con-
fidence. We need to make sure 
everyone is playing at their peak. 
The pressure was on us this week-
end, and it'll be there again later 
on."

Women's tennis takes conference crown 
5 -0 CSULA shutout opens doors to NCAA Regionals 

Men's crew 
sweeps San 
Diego city 
regatta 

By ANGELA UN 
Staff \\\iter 

On the bright, swmy afternoon 
of April 18, the Tritons women's 
tennis team crowned themselves 
with their first ever California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
championship title with a 5-0 win 
over Cal State Los Angeles at 
UCSD's Northview Tennis 
Courts. 

The championship match, 
which was postponed due to rain, 
will give the women a chance to 
compete in the NCAA regional 
qualifier tournament in two weeks. 
Matchups and dates are yet to be 
determined. 

The tournament victory was 
the first for UCSD, which lost in 
the championships in the past two 
years. But as the old saying goes, 
the third time's the charm, and the 
Tritons achieved their season goal 
of winning the conference crown. 
En route to the championships, 
the women defeated Sonoma 
State, 5-1 , on April 16 in the semi-
finals . The two wins put the 
Tritons' overall season record at 
16-8. 

"We came out fighting today 
because we really wanted it this 
year," Senior Kristina Jansen said. 
"For the past two years, we've lost 
in the championships, so this year 
we were determined not to let it 
happen again."

Associate Sports Editor 

The Tritons men's crew team 
assaulted crosstown rivals San 
Diego State and University of San 
Diego on April 17 at the San Diego 
City Championships in Mission 
Bay. UCSD swept all five of the 
events in which its boats raced. 

"One of our goals on the coach-
ing staff this season was to win 
every race at the City 
Championships," first-year head 
coach Mark Davis said. 

The men's varsity eight opened 
the contest by tearing away from 
San Diego State with a time of six 
minutes, 29 seconds flat versus the 
Aztecs second-place fini sh at 
6:36.43 . 

"I thought we had a pretty good 
race," senior co-captain Eric 
Hardeman said. "We were close for 
the first 1,000 [meters1, but we 
pulled away." 

Due to constantly changing 
tidal conditions, crew racing times 
are difficult to compare, so 
although the April 17 spli ts for the 
Tritons were not the faste t of the 
season, the performance was still 
considered tellar.

T he UCSD softball team swept 
a pair of games against California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
rival Cal State San Bernardino on 
April 16 at Triton Softball Field. 

The Tritons charged out of the 
gate in the first game, scoring four 
runs in the first inning and never 
looking back. Senior third baseman 
Amy Mettee started the game off 
with a single, and was followed by 
sophomore shortstop Desiree 

Franciscus, who also singled. 
Junior catcher Jamie Hurst came 
up a few batters later and belted a 
double, scoring Mettee and 
Franciscus. Senior first baseman 
Jodie Bland came to the plate next, 
and blasted her fourth home run of 
the season, scoring Hurst, and 
making it 4-0 at the end of the first. 

UCSD once again made use of 
the long ball in the second inning, 
when Franciscus went yard for her 
third time this year, scoring

The 11 th-ranked UCSD men's 

tennis team traveled north and 
pocketed a pair of victories over 
UC Davis and Sonoma State on 
April 16 and April 17. The 
Division n Tritons extended their 
winning streak to four consecutive 
matches and improved their 
record to 16-9 overall. 

Before heading north, UCSD 
played a nonconference match 
across town against Point Loma 
Nazarene on April 14. The 
Tritons cruised past the Sea Lions 
with a 7-2 victory. 

"We are beginning to under-
stand that mentally, we have to be 
there every time," Tritons head 
coach Eric Steidlmayer said. "I was 
happy with the level of play we 
brought against Point Loma and 
think that we will improve it. We 
will continue to practice serve and 
return as the season winds down." 

The Tritons took two of three 
doubles matches to gain an early 
2 -1 edge over Point Lorna 
N azarene. Senior Amir Nejad and 
junior Bryan Swatt paired up to 
defeat Johanees Vance and Sean 
Sand, 8-4, while sophomore Brent 
Molden and senior Nick Morton 
won against Matt Copland and 
Josh Cowan, 8-3. Seniors Sameer 
Chopra and Jeff Wilson were 
defeated, 8-4, by Zack Markham 
and Christan Gerloff. Chopra 
returned to action in this match 
after being sidelined from an 
injury. 

"Sameer [Chopra] is an inte-
gral part of the squad,"

-Hey, Mr. Wilson-: Jeff Wilson (above) and the men's tennis team are on a 
four-match winning streak with one match remaining before playoffs begin. 
Steidl mayer said. "He brings a lot 
from a talent perspective, the 
guys have confidence in his abili-
ty, and it also allows each player 
to play down a spot in the lineup, 
which provides confidence in our 
squad." 

UCSD continued its solid 
play in singles by taking five of 
six matches. Wilson, Swatt, 
sophomore Emil Novalc, Molden 
and freshman Seth Spector 
defeated their Point Loma oppo-
nents to secure the dual match 
victory for the Tritons. After 

their win, UCSD had a few days 
off to prepare for their road trip 
up north . 

"It is really important for us 
to go north and compete really 
well," Steidlmayer said. "We 
need to have a great mental per-
formance in every match we play 
from here on out. Nothing else 
will be tolerated for this squad. 
The key to victory is staying 
aggressive with our play and 
always looking for the opportu-
