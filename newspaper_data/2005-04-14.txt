Newsom defends licenses 
Mayor explains support for gay marriage 

By SHANNON EUOT 
Senior Staff Writer 

A little more than a year after 
he ca me into the national spot-
light by granting more than 4,000 
marriage licenses to same-sex cou-
pie, San Francisco Mayor Gavin 

eW50m told UCSD students and 
staff in a campus address on April 
11 that he had no regrets about 
his actions. The talk, sponsored 
by the DeWitt Higgs Memorial 
Lecture series, was part of a larger 
panel discussion on the topic. 

Though the state 's Supreme 
Court later struck down the licens-
es, Newsom said the California 
constitution justified his actions 
by proclaiming all state citizens to 
be equal under law. 

Since then, the political battles 
at both the state and federal levels 
over gay marriage have rapidly 
intensified. Several states across 
the country amended their consti-
tutions last year to include prohi -
bitions aga inst gay marriage, and 
Pre ident George W . Bush has 
backed a similar amendment to 
the federal Consti tution. 

"Throughout American his-
tory, discrimination has been 
enforced by law and upheld by 
the courts," ewsom said. "Th.is

UCSD hit with 25 
file .. sharing suits 
By VLADIMIR KOGAN 

News Editor 

The Recordi ng Industry 
As ociation of America has sued 
25 unidentified U SO students, 
who are now among 405 students 
at 18 different university campuses 
charged \vith u ing an extremely 
fast academic network to illegally 
share music. 

Filed on April 13 , the legal com-
plaints target users of the "i2hub" 
application, which relies on the 
advanced Internet2 technology 
used by approximately 200 uni-
versities. The network was origi-
nally designed for use in academic 
research and substantially acceler-
ates file-transfer speeds. Many stu-
dents believed that illegal file shar-
ing was protected on the i2hub net-
work because of the do ed nature 
of the Internet2 environment. 

"What we wanted to do is punc-
ture that misconception and let 
people know that when they are 
on the Internet, there is no pl ace 
for lawlessness," R1AA President 
Cary Sherman said in an April 
12 press conference. "With th.is 
action, we are putting students and 
users everywhere on notice that 
there are consequences to uses of 
this special network." 

Sherman said his colleagues at 
the Motion Picture Association 

of America wou ld al 0 pursue 
an unknown number of law uits 
against users f the network. 

The so-call ed "John Doe" uits 
- which list only IP addresses of 
defendants - say that the tlldcms 
charged in the newest round of 
cases have shared an average of 
2,300 music files each. The law lIits 
target 18 schools across the coun-
try, including U Berkeley, though 
Sherman said the industry asso-
ciation had evidence of i2hub use 
for copyright infringement at 450 
campuses in 4 1 states. 0 more 
than 25 students have been charged 
at anyone campus. 

Use of hub technology has 
become popular on the next-gener-
ation network because it all ows for 
downloads that are eXIJonenti ally 
faster than peer-to-peer software 
designed for the regular Internet. 
For example, a ong download 
through fnternet2 takes fewer than 
20 seconds, and a movie can be 
shared in less than five minute~ . 

AJohn Muir College freshman, 
who asked that his name not be 
used for fear of legal retaliation by

Professors protest new 
textbook additions 

UCAB to ~xtend Wendy's lease 
By PATRICK ALLEN 

Senior Staff Writer 
Seven hundred math and phys-

ics professors from 150 universi -
ties nationwide have called on 
Thompson Learning to take steps 
to reduce the costs of textbooks 
for college students, the Cali fornia 
Public Interest Research Group 
has announced. 

As a result of the Affordable 
Textbook Campaign launched last 
year by the Public Interest Research 
Groups including CALPIRG, 180 
physics professors and more than 
500 mathematics professors signed 
two letters to the CEO of the text-
book publisher, Rona ld Schlosser, 

stating that many of the compa-
ny's policies unfairly increase the 
price of textbooks for American 
students. 

Among the signatories to the 
letters were 15 UCSD profes-
sors and lecturers, including visit-
ing mathematics professor Kathy 
Kailikole, who felt that the rising 
cost of education should not be 
exacerbated by the price of text-
books . 

Specifically, the professors called 
on Thompson Learning to decrease 
the frequency of its updates for 
two books, Serway's "Physics for 
Scientists and Engineers" (Sixth

Expansion will cause eatery to relocate 
By CHRlsnNE CLARK 

Staff Writer 

Plans to expand Price Center 
will force Wendy's to relocate, 
despite the fact that the compa-
ny's current leasing contract with 
UCSD does not end until 2008. In 
order to compensate the franch.ise, 
the University Center Advisory 
Board will approve a lease exten-
sion for Wendy'S and pay for a 
new, upgraded restaurant space. 

The proposed relocation will 
not occur until 2007, and it is 
estimated that it will cost the uni-
versity $100,000, according to 
University Centers Director Gary 
R. Ratcliff. 

In 2003, snldents approved the 
Price Center expansion referen-
dum, which included self-assessed 
fees to pay for the growth of 
Price Center and the ' expansion 
of Student Center. The project's 
Building Advisory Committee, 
wh.ich oversees the design of the 
project, recommended building a 
new food court and an atrium 
where students can dine. 

"The Building Advisory 
Committee wanted them con-
nected," Advisory Committee Co-
chair and UCAB Chair Jessica 

Billy WonpJ Guordian 

McMnr out Due to Price Center expansion plans, Wenc}(s will be forced to relocate 
in 2007, even though its current leasing contrad will not expire until 2008. 
Kort said. "We want to have one 
dining facility and for it to look 
like the same building." 

Ratcliff said UCAB will have 
to relocate Wendy'S to maxe space 
for the connection between the 
new extension and the current 
food court. 

"We are going to build a COf-

ridor where the Wendy's is and 
move it to the new food court," 
Ratcliff said. 

The move will force Wendy's 
to close down for up to one 
month, despite the campus' con-
tractual obligation to provide a

space for the restaurant under its 
lease agreement. 

Ratcliff said that due to the 
inconvenience, a lease extension 
will be granted to Wendy's, but that 
the two parties have not yet agreed 
on the final details of the deal. 

"That is part of our strategy, 
so they will absorb some of the 
COSt of the move," Ratcliff said. 

However, UCAB has not offi-
ciany approved a new lease agree-
ment with Wendy's. 

"I didn't sign tht: lease agree-
ment. but I think this is a special 
case because we are stuck. due to 
the timing." Kort said. "But we 
haven't been having any issues 
with [Wendy's], so we have no 
reason not to renew their lease." 

In addition. UCSD has 
agreed to p:fy for a new upgraded 
yVendy's restaurant space. 

"What we are going to do is 
provide them a semi-improved 
shell space." Ratcliff said . 
"Typically we provide diem with 
a [basic] shell. but this space is 
special because they are moving 
at our request. ... They are still 
going to have to move their res-
taurant equipment." 

RatcliffsaidrelocatingWendy's 
was the most cost-effective option 
for building a corridor that would 
seamJessly connect both the old 

and new dining facilities . 
"We were going to expand the 

existing corridor behind Panda 
Express. but there is a [media cen-
ter] closet. and the cost of moving 
that would have been up to $1 
million. so moving the Wendy's is 
cheaper." Ratcliff said. 

UCAB is trying to coordi-
nate the transition with Wendy'S 
by building the walkway last. so 
the restaurant wi ll be closed for 
the shortest time period possible. 
The rest of the food court will 
remain operational throughout 
the construction. according to 
Ratcliff. 

" [We] hope they will leave 
[building the corridor] for the last 
minute. so we can remain open." 
Wendy's manager David Toocker 
said. 

The cost of plans to expand 
Price Center is estimated to be 
$56 million. 

Construction is expected to 
begin during the 2006-07 school 
year. but the Wendy's relocation 
is not expected to take place until 
2007. 

"Wendy's lovers will not have 
to fret - the goal is to have it 
closed for as little time as pos-
sible." Ratcliff said.

tion in support of the service 
workers and their strike on April 
14 by a vote of 12-2-0. With 
the passage of the resolution. the 
council said it reaffirmed its sup-
port for the fight of the workers 
for a pay raise and career advance-
ment opportunities. 

Reports 
Vice P resident of Acad emic 
Affairs Caroline Song 

Song reported tha t the 
Committee on Education Policy 
is considering eliminating stu-
dents' ability to retake classes in 
which they receive a grade of D 
or F. 

According to Song. the com-
mittee believes that the policy 
contributes to grade inflation. 
which it sees as a large problem 
at UCSD. 

CORRECTIONS

Item D 

The council changed its elec-
tion bylaws governing the candi-

ment. word limits were placed on 
candidate statements . 

In the 2005 election. however. 
several statements remained with-

Universi~ calls service 

stril(e illegal 
In an e-mail message sent to 

campus personnel, ASSistant Vice 
Chancellor of Human Resources 
Rogers Davis said the university 
considers the one-day service strike 
scheduled for April 14 to be "illegal.' 

'The university Office of the 
President has stated that the strike 
will be illegal, because the university 
and [the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees] 
have notJet completed the statutorily 
mandate impasse process," he stated 
in the e-mail. 'The university also 
believes that AFSCME has failed to 
participate in the impasse process in 
good faith and has advised the various 
unions of its position on this matter." 

Rogers said that all picket lines are 
"expected to be peaceful demonstra-
tions,' asking employees to call ahead 
of time to alert their supervisor of a 
planned absence. Employees claim-
ing an absence due to illness will be 
required to provide medical docu-
mentation upon their return or risk 
not getting paid. the e-mail stated. 

In a response sent out bye-mail to 
fellow union members and forwarded 
to the press. UCSD library employee 
Glen Motil said the letter was filled 
with "disrespect, disdain and disre-
gard" and that the new sick-leave 
policy constituted "petty distrust' and 
"overreaching of authority." 

'Picket lines and demonstrations are 
not 'peaceful,'" Motil stated in an e-mail. 
'They are meant to disrupt the com-
mon flow of everyday acbvity and call 
attention to human rights violations: 

Software to improve 
Wi-Fi network handoH 

New software, developed by 
two UCSD computer scientists. may 
one day allow for seamless roam-
ing between different Wi-Fi wireless 
Intemet networks. The technology 
may make it possible for users of 
various wireless devices to remain 
connected to high-speed networks as 
they travel from one access point to 
another - say from an airport lounge 
to a nearby Starbucks. 

The software dramatically reduces 
the amount of time needed to hand 
off from one Wi-Fi network to another. 
one of the major current barriers to 
roaming. At the present time, weaken-
ing signals far from access points cause 
Wi-Fi-€nabled laptops to lose packets 
of data. The program, which is pat-
ent-pending. would continuously scan 
surrounding access-points to ensure 
the fastest possible hand off. Current 
technology begins scan.ning only when 
the present signal is running low.

Study shows drug may 
delay Alzheimer's 

Researchers. including the chair of 
UCSD's department of neuroscienc-
es Leon Thai, believe that taking the 
drug donepezil may delay the onset of 
Alzheimer's disease in patients suffering 
from mild cognitive impairrnen~ but 
provides no long-term benefits, they 
reported in a new national study. 

First published in the New England 
Journal of Medicine, the study com-
pared the effects of donepezil, Vitamin 
E and a placebo. It was the first of its 
kind to suggest that any agent can 
delay the diagnosis of the disease. 
However, the researchers wamed that 
the study "did not provide support for 
a clear recommendation for the use 
of donepezil."

Eight University of California 

researchers have been named among 
the 30 Pacific Coast recipients of the 
prestigious Guggenheim fellowships 
for 2005. 

In total, the New York-based

Foundation granted more than 
$7,112,000 in its annual awards to 186 
artists. scholars and scientists from the 
United States and Canada. More than 
3,000 researchers vied for the money.

Sixty-two percent of hiring managers 
inc! uded in the most recent Job outlook 
survey by CareerBuilder.com said they 
were planning to hire recent college 
graduates and a quarter also said they 
planned on raising their starting salaries 
over last year',. Only 6 percent said 
they planned to cut salaries. 

The survey, conducted over the 
previous two months, included more 
than 600 hiring managers across the 
nation. 

(Nerall, 59 percent of hiring man-
agers said they expect to offer less 
than $30,000, while 26 percent said 
they plan to pay between ~30,OOO 
and $39,000. An additional 10 per-
cent said they expect salaries to range 
between $40,000 and $49,000, 
while 6 percent said they would offer 
$50,000 or more. 

The hiring managers ranked "rel-

Mayor: Professor calls marriages a mistake 
continued from page I 

people who want to express their 
devoted love to each other. I have 
more resolve than ever that what 
we did was right. I took an oath 
to bear true faith and allegiance 
to the constitutions of California 
and the United States ... and 
the Constitution was created to 
protect the minority against thc 
whims of the majority." 

Newsom sought to inform 
audience members of the current 
split of public opinion, as well as 
inspire them to take action. 

"This issue should not be iso-
lated to 47 square miles in the 
city by the bay," Newsom said in 
an interview. "We need to dis-
cuss fundamental principles that 
transcend issues of gender. As a 
Democrat and human being. I 
believe people deserve equal pro-
tection under law." . 

University of San Diego School 
of Law Professor Steven D . Smith, 
a member of the panel, was critical 
ofNewsom's actions. 

"It's a threat to peace and con-
tinuity," Smith said. "I think it is 
clear the mayor did act outside 
of his authority and contrary to 
the law." 

Smith said that while he 
admired the mayor's initiative to 
raise awareness about the issue. 
he found trouble with the "sus-
tained portrayal of a public given 
to demagoguery and justice." 

Whi le liberals have tradition-
ally been associated with support-
ing gay-rights issues, Newsom was 
quick to denounce the actions of 
his own Democratic Party. 

"I've traditionally been proud 
of our party because we have 
always stood on principle .. . but 
now we are abandoning principle 
for political expedience," Newsom 
said . 

The mayor compared the 

issue to other examples of legal-
ized segregation and inequality 
in American history. He empha-
sized various cases in which 
women were not allowed to 
vote and interracial marriages 
were prohibited, as well as the 
famous 1857 Dred Scott case. At 
the time, Supreme Court Chief 
Justice Roger B. Taney declared 
that all blacks were not and could 
never become citizens. 

Newsom also referred to let-
ters written by Marrin Luther 
King, Jr. whi le imprisoned in a 
Birmingham, Ala., jail, which 
debunked critics who said that 

" 1 think it is clear the 
mayor did act outside of 

his authority and 
contrary tD the law," 

- Steven D. Smith. ~r, 
University of San Diego School 

of Law 

King was pursuing changes too 
quickly. 

"Some say I've gone too fast, 
but 'wait' almost always means 
never," Newsom said. "I think 
this is the last great civil rights 
struggle in our lifetime. Civil 
unions are separate and unequal 
... please do not be fooIe-d by 
those who talk about the tradi-
tion of marriage." 

Newsom acknowledged that 
his viewpoint was not the majority 
one in America. saying he hopes 
that those who are passionate 
about the cause wi ll continue to 
support the struggle. 

"This is just the beginning of a 

Real Life 

long process," he said. "We have 
faced and will continue to face 
tremendous setbacks ... . I know 
I'm a minority in California. 
but we all need to think more 
broadly of consequences of the 
status quo." 

Following Newsom's speech, 
a panel of local legal scholars dis-
cussed the mayor's actions. 

"The importance of what 
Newsom did cannot be mini-
mized," California Western 
School of Law Professor Barbara 
J. Cox said. "He put the money 
and resources of San Francisco 
behi nd a battle of equality. We 
need the members of the [lesbi-
an, gay, bisexual and transgender 
community) as well as non-gay 
all ies to take on positions similar 
to Newsom's." 

UCSD Professor of Sociology 
John Evans said that while 
Newsom and others are active 
in pursuing change, they must 
remember not to alienate poten-
tial all ies to see resul ts. 

"I must make the argument 
that what the public thinks cannot 
be ignored." Evans said. "Keep 
in mind you have to bring along 
people who don't agree with you 
in some way or another. The pub-
lic is increasingly consensual and 
becoming more liberal at the same 
time. This is not a culture war for 
the average person, but for party 
eli tes who are elected." 

Smith said all sides needed to 
moderate their rhetoric in the 
deb~te. 

"We must try and understand 
the different views in play without 
accusing those differing with us of 
hatred," Smith said. "For all its 
flaws, this is supposed to be govern-
ment by the people for the people."

Books: Publisher's study 
says faculty support updates 

continued from page I 
Edition) and Stewart's "Calculus: 
Early Transcendentals" (Fifth 
Edition). According to the study 
conducted by CALPIRG. the pre-
vious editions of these two books 
were only available for four years 
before they were updated. 

"While textbook editions 
must be updated periodically to 
reflect new teaching methods and 
so forth, we do not believe that 
the content of [these] particular 
update [s] justified an entirely new 
edition," both letters stated . "This 
is especially the case when one 
takes into account the additional 
expense new editions create for 
many students and the additional 
time faculty members must take 
to revise syllabi and other instruc-
tional materials to accommodate 
the changes to the text." 

Speaking on behalf of 
Thompson Learning and the text-
book industry, the Association of 
American Publishers dismissed the 
letters, calling the CALPIRG data 
flawed. 

"My members and I have met 
with pmG representatives for more 
than 18 months to create an open 
discussion and share data." AAP 
President Pamcia Schroeder stated 
in a press release. "Unfortunately, 
PIRG continues to attempt to 
influence the media and public by 
ignoring valid research and informa-
tion from independent, third-party 
sources, returning again and again to 
figures assembled by biased student 
volunteers. pmG just doesn't let the 
facts get in their way." 

According to a study trumpeted 
by the AAP, 80 percent of the 1.029 
faculty members surveyed said that 
it was important for textbooks to be 
as current as possible. Additionally, 

62 percent said that they ordered 
textbooks with the most rece nt 
copyright date and 38 percent said 
that they were satisfied with the 
frequency of the updates. 

The letters to Thompson 
Learning also asked the te,xtbook 
giant to decrease the price dispar-
ity between the price of textbooks 
in the United States and abroad . 
According to the letter. a used cal-
culus book published by Thompson 
Learning costs an American student 
more than $120, while it sells for 
the equivalent of $100 in Canada 
and $60 in England. 

According to the AAP. however, 
the price of textbooks overseas is 
based on the individual markets, 
and helps publishers recoup some 
of the costs of production which 
would otherwise be passed on to 
American students. 

The two sides have been dead-
locked in recent discussions with-
out any budging, according to cor-
respondences posted on the "Vec 
site of the state PIRGs. IIowever. 
according to the CALP1RG afford-
able textbook campaign Campus 
Coordinator for UCSD Derlin 
Hsu, processes are under way in 
hopes of breaking the deadlock. 

"Congress is doing an inves-
tigation right now, which should 
come out in July," Hsu stated 
in an e-mail. "We are doing our 
own research that will come out 
next September. In the meantime. 
we are still discussing this issue 
on the administrative level with 
academic senates across the UC 
system and trying to convince 
them to adopt our resolutions on 
this issue."

The UCSD Guardian is published MIce a week at the University 01 California at San Diego,

New A.S. Council 
must implement IRV 

Chances are, you didn't vote in this election. In fact, four out of the 
five people sitting in front 
of you didn't vote either. 
And for most A.S. executive 
offices, official election data 
show that approximately 12 
of the 13 people on your 
right didn't vote for the per-
son that will occupy each 
respective office. 

Several y,ears ago, the 
AS. Council approved rec-
ommendations to adopt 
changes to its voting system, 
instituting a method called 
instant runoff voting. Under 
IRV, no candidate can win 
without a majority of sup-
port from the voters. Instead, 
voters rate their preferences 
among candidates and, in 
cases where no candidate 
achieves a majority on the 
first ballot, the votes from 
the lowest scoring candi-
dates roll over to die voters' 
next preferences. 

In effect, IRVencoura&es 

more candidates to run for 
each office and also assures 
that each winner is actually 
among the tor choices of 
the majority of voters, not 
simply the plurality. Last 
year, the council appropriat-
ed the money to implement 
the system, but the money 
was never spent and was 
instead used by this year's 
senators on other projects. 

If A.S. President-elect 
Christopher Sweeten is truly 
interested in increasing the 
responsiveness and repre-
sentative nature of the coun-
cil, the answer is the institu-
tion of IRV, not complicated 
consrirurional referenda like 
the one on last week's ballot. 
And with an expected 2.5-
percent student population 
growth, the system could be 
paid for without sacrificing 
current programs. 

Like its predecessors 
promised to do in the pre-
vious three years, the new 
council must utilize IRV. 

Music industry must 
adapt to filesharing 

UCSD, meet the Recordin~ Industry Association of 
America. The trade behe-
moth is suing 25 students 
this week as part of a national 
effort to discourage what it 
calls a "new piracy epidem-
ic" fostered by hign-speed 
acaderruc networks. The 
lawsuits may only be shots 
across the bow - grant-
ed, the first such targeting 
UCSD students - but they 
represen t an unfortunate 
and quite frightening read-
ing of intellectual property 
prevailing within the enter-
tainment industry. ' 

What the RIAA doesn't 
know is that no number of 
lawsuits will deter the peer-
to-peer file sharing made so 
wonderfully viable by tech-
nology such as Internet2, 
the culprit in this week's 
cases. Worse though, the 
industry has chosen to 
avenge the major-label 
profit gaps this technology 
has spurred at the expense 
of customers, technological 
progress and the naoon's 
longstanding academic tra-

dition of creative sharing 
and borrowing. 

UCSD was righ t to reject 
the RIAA's request that uni-
versities filter access to the 
technology in question, not 
simply because the "i2hub" 
application used in these 
cases has many "legiti-
mate" functions, but also 
because the industry has no 
right to regulate the non-
profit traffic of materials 
that hold the same intel-
lectual potential as course 
reading. 

That said, if the RIAA 
really wanted to convince 
University of California and 
California State University 
students of the depravity of 
illegal file sharing, it would 
throw its weight behind 
the two universities' cur-
rent efforts to provide stu-
dents with affordable online 
music services. Welcoming 
such innovation and treating 
patrons as fans, critics and 
scholars - not simply con-
sumers - would do much 
for the tarnished image and 
prosperity of this truggling 
group.

The cell phone always rings twice 
Great 
Expectations 

Carol Freire 

Everyone has been that guy. You know, the jerk who got a call - gasp - in the 
middle of lecture. It's OK; we're 
only human, it happens. As a 
response, everyone present has 
the same thought, quasi-simul-
taneously: "That 's annoying." 
But as that guy hurriedly tries to 
si lence the offending cell phone, 
why doesn't everyone have the 
subsequent thought, "I should 
turn mine o ff, too"? Is it really 
so unreasonable to expect those 
present to have such a thought? 

Apparently so, as evidenced 
by a lecture 1 attended , which 
was interrupted by four different 
cell phones. Four! C'mon people, 
that's ridiculous. I 'm no expert in 
etiquette, and T do make mistakes 
- but that's too much. 

U nfortunately, such socia l 
neg ligence is rather common. I 
have a class in York 2722 where, 
routinely, eve ry seat but seven or 
o are taken. Well , they're not 

taken by people, but they are 
often ta ken up by backpacks . And 
the backpacks are so intensely 
concentrated on learnin g chem-
istry that when poor, breathless 
students rush in a few minutes 
late from their previous class in 
Warren Lecture Hall , the back-
packs refuse to give up their 

seats. 
Interestingly enough, these 

backpacks are not paying $19,623 
yearly to attend school like the 
slightly tardy students, so you 
would think they would feel 
embarrassed and readily give up 
their seats . Not so. Sometimes, 
they won't even leave when gen-

" A common 
misconception about 

manners is that 
people who have 

them are doormats, 
quietly acquiescing 
and silently fuming 

while the 
streeHavvy trounce 

all over them. 
Rubbish. We need 

only w look w Miss 
M " anners ... 

tly asked . To add insult to injury, 
on the way home a few of them 
even find their way onto shuttle 
seats. 

Perhaps this is too abstract 
for the offending, so read care-
fully: Despite what [he shame-

ful parts of our history seem to 
say, it is generally accepted that 
people are more important than , 
and not the sa me as, property. 
And while di srupting class by 
coming in late is rude, so is 
exacerbating the matter by not 
letting a person sit down quickly 
and silently wi thout having to 
beg for a seat. Given, those pres-
ent get priority over those not 
present, even if the not-present 
intend to come to lecture in 20 
minutes. Especially after lecture 
has already started . 

Some people are aware that 
they are rude and think things 
are best left that way because 
manners are for sheep. A com-
mon misconception about man-
ners is that people who have them 
are doormats, quietly acquiesc-
ing and silently fuming while 
the street-savvy trounce allover 
them . Rubbish. We need only to 
look to Miss Manners, etiquette 
columnist for the Wa.rhingtan 
Post . She is pithily caustic, having 
no patience for the greedy and 
self-absorbed, but delivers her 
lessons with wit, humor and, of 
course, perfect politesse. 

Another equally egregious 
misconception is that the goal 
of etiquette is to amass as much 
arcane knowledge about whether 
the finger bowl goes to the right 
or left of the water glass so that 
one may embarrass and correct 
others, thereby appearing supe-
rior. In reality, directly correct-

THURSDAY. APRIL 14, 2005 

Every year, the A.S. elections are fraught with unreason-able proposals, but apart 
from the obvious "take away A.S. 
Council stipends to fund another 
concert" one, most of the propos-
als this year have been entirely 
reasonable and admirable. Many 
ideas brought forth in the election, 
including some strong proposals 
for greater online A.S. represen-
tation, are entirely doable if A.S . 
council members drop their "saving 
the world" crises for an afternoon 
or two and put in the work to get 
the job done. There is no accept-
able reason for the absence of an 
online survey to aid with c,oncen 
act selection, or for not posting 
agendas online before every A.S . 
Council meeting. T he students 
of UCSD understand the incom-
ing council's passion for national 
issues, and share its enthusiasm 
for those issues, but students will 
not share in the council's trust 
of state and national representa-
tives unless their own government 
shows it can work toward tangible 
improvements to current condi-
tions. Consider the addition of 
more online services to the A.S. 
Web site a freebie: It's a cheap and 
effortless way to prove you actually 
care about UCSD students. 

- Brian Uip 
Senior Staff Writer 

T he incoming A.S. Council would do well to connect better with the student body. 
Most of us don't have the slightest 
clue what the council does. Some 
of us don't even know that we pay 
a fee that Associated Students allo-
cates to various organizations and 
events. The new cabinet should 
reach out to the campus and help 
more people understand what it 
does. This could entail more pub-
licity in the form of flyers and 
placards; maybe the council could 
issue a parking manifesto or some-
thing to catch the eye of the typical 
UCSD student. 

Gr:mted, it's the responsibility of 
the individual student to care about 
student government. But maybe it 
would be worthwhile for the council 
to sit down and assess how to really 
reach out to the campus. They could 
try asking random people in Price 
Center what Associated Students 
means to them, And the responses 
could be a starting point in diminish-
ing the disconnect between student 
government and the constituents it's 
supposedly serving. One hopes that 
the "in the dark and that's OK with 
me" attitude of most students does 
not reflect future attitudes toward 
participation in the political process 
on the national front.

Saving the world, saving outreach or 
saving its image: What is the proper 
diredion for the new A.S. Council? 
Maurice Junious, incom-ing commissioner of stu-dent services, and Soap 
Chum, incoming commissioner 
of communications, must both 
learn how to deal with media 
attention and controversy. As evi-
denced by his pathetic display 
under the public eye at the infa-
mous AS Council meeting on 
March 2, outgoing Commissioner 
of Student Services Kian Maleki 
was completely incompetent in 
his duties as representative of 
Student-Run Television to the 
A.S. Council. 

Learn from Maleki's fail-
ures: Take the time to learn 
all about the rules and charters 
of your organizations, as well 
as UC Office of the President 
policy, before hasti ly declaring 
any legal interpretation "incor-
rect." Answer the siren call of the 
national media with a firm hand 
and a strong voice ; do not allow 
yourself to be made a fool on 
national televisi on. 

Realize that even though you 
personally may not agree with the 
actions of your constituents, you 
are obligated to act in their best 
interests. Above all, consider this 
year 's events lessons to be learned 
from. 

- Brian Uip 
Senior Staff Writer 

so, barely 20 percent of the student body voted in this year's elections - 19.86 per-
cent, to be exact. Should we laugh, 
should we cry, should we just give 
up caring at all? Let's just laugh 
- for while such a turnout is piti-
ful , the causes of such pathetic 
political participation could be 
much worse than they are. At least 
we are apathetic in lieu of having 
something to get seriously upset 
about; we could roil up campus pol-
itics all we want, but hey, Library 
Walk is nice as it is: calm, peaceful 
and sunny. People go about their 
duties in ways that don't make any 
demands on anyone else; the atmo-
sphere seems to say "mind your 
own business," and consequently 
students go unmolested and are 
free to worry about whatever they 
choose - like student porn, of 
course, which a pparently repre-
sents the height of our ability to 
give a damn. Yet, students are sup-
posed to get upset about the little, 
administrative things; they are sup-
posed to care, right? Well, perhaps 
social entanglements are overrated. 
None of that for UCSD - the 
A.S. Council should recognize that 
we reserve the right, as the future 
educated sector of the country, to 
glory in our apathetic content. 

- Robin Averbeck 
Staff Writer 

T he new A. . Council has a tall order to fil l. It faces a bevy of problems - well, 
perhaps to be more positive, we 
should term them opportunities 
- mostly related to how the Stu -
dent body views it and its mostly 
behind-the-scenes toil. It must 
ei ther defend or trim its travel 
budget, do the same for stipends 
and other perks, save outreach 
in the midst of state budget cuts 
compounded by the failure of the 
referendum to fund student-initi -
ated outreach, and cut bureau-
cracy for student organizatior,s 
seeking funding. Picking and 
choosing from these tasks is not 
an option; the new council , load -
ed with raw talent, must attack 
all these problems at once, while 
neglecting none. 

Most importantly, it must not 
only work on behalf of students 
but make it abunda ntl y clear to 
a skeptica l stud ent bod y what 
excellent work it's doing. The 
student electorate did well this 
year, in choosi ng representatives 
who have proven their compe-
tence and passion or, at the very 
least, shown great potential. If 
these representatives ignore the 
PR aspect of their jobs, it will be 
at their own peril.

Column: 
Students 

often lack 
decorum 
continued from page 4 

the presence of others, is boorish 
and mi sses the entire point of 
etiquette. Acrually. it does worse. 
It counters the point of etiquette . 
The point of e tiquette is to show 
respect for others and make them 
feel comfortable around you, as 
well as to diffuse conflicr. 

Rudeness ca n also have conse-
que n ces in the workplace . Surveys 
being flouted among student gov-
ernme nt commi ttees show that 
employers of recent UCSD grad-
uates think we need more people 
ski lls. 

We're not people persons. 
Riding the shuttl e or looking 
around York 2722, [ can't say 
['m surprised. ~at is bother-
som e about rudeness, besides the 
fact that no one wants to be on 
the receiving end, is that it shows 
an entrenched selfishness and dis-
regard for others. The uninten-
tionally rude especially are so self-
centered that they do not even 
think to consider others. It's not 
just that they are lazy and think 
their backpack des erves a seat 
more than you do - th ey never 
bother at all to consider that the 
place is full and that other people 
need seating. 

If employers want someone 
who can communicate and work 
well on a team, perhaps a good lit-
mus test is to consider how politely 
that person behaves around his or 
her peers. People who are polite 
freque ntly assess how their actiolls 
are impacting others ; people who 
are rude rarely do. Polite people 
often wonder what others are 
thinki ng. where others are com-
ing from or what others' needs 
are. These kinds of assessment 
are needed to work well with oth-
ers. Interperso nal ski lls are based 
on the ability to understand and 
empath ize with others' concerns. 
To sell a product. give good cus-
tomer service or calm a patient at 
the bedside, you need this ski ll. 
You need theory of mind, which 
some o f us, apparently, lack. 

Perhaps then we. as UCSD 
students. need practice in con· 
sidering others' needs. If your 
si lver-threaded si lk backpack has 
accidentally found its way onto a 
seat, and the place is more than 
half full , you should set it bade 
down on the floor . If it can't 
learn to stay there or on your lap, 
perhaps it should be left at h o me 
unti l it learns to behave. If your 
foot is really tired, you may take 
it for a walk. 

Under no ci rcumstance, how-
ever, are you to let it rest on the 
shoulders or chair of the person 
in the row in front of you. Doing 
so will reveal you as socially 
impaired. If the shuttle is getting 
full and you refuse to move from 
your aisle seat to the empty win-
dow seat , you are letting everyone 
on the shuttle know that you are 
still stuck in the "me, me, me" 
stage most of us left behind on our 
third birthdays. 

This is exceedingly unattract-
ive because it implies you're the 
sort of person who hogs all the 
covers at night, talks on and on 
about yourself or gets stuck with 
the nickname "minuteman. " No 
one wants to date that. Except 
perhaps other people in such stag-
es of arrested development . 

Next time the infamous cell 
phone rings in class, expect that 
a good number of people will be 
having, and acti ng on, the thoug ht 
to turn theirs off. When it rings 
again, you can be sure th e same 
number of people will have fl agged 
whom not to date or hire.

RIAA officials - could nor access 
it. The student, who shares more 
than 1),000 songs and was rated 
among the rop· \O file sharers from 
UC campuses by the network, said 
he stopped using the application 
when its manufacturer moved to 
expand access to off-campus users 
who were wi lling ro pay a fee. 

;'That completely opened the 
door for people to come in and see 
what's going on," he said. 

Unlike other peer-to-peer 
software. students also use i2hub 
to share lecnlre notes and other 
school-rtlated materials . 

In a statement issued in response 
to a GllflrdlOlI inquiry, the maker of 
the application denied that the soft-
ware promoted illegal copyright 
violations. 

"The i2hub organization doe 
notcondoneacti~tiesandacrions 
that brcach the rights of copyright 
owners," the organization stated 
in an e- mail. "Our companies are 
focused on bringing together stu-
dents and connecting them in 
ways never before achieved. ... 
Studenrs across rhe globe utilize 
i2hub for many reasons: help on 
homework. exam reviews. sharing 
ideas and some have even fo und 
their s ignificant other through 
the network ." 

Sherman said that the RLi\A 
had not sued the organization 
itself, though it was possible that 
its creators were among the 25 
students sued at the University 
of Massachusetts, Amherst, where 
the network began. However. 
i2hub did not respond to ques-
tions about its role and coopera-
tion in the suits. 

Academic Computing Services 
Director Tony Wood said that 
information maintained by Res et 
can link individual IP addresses 
to pecific on-campus computers 
and their owners. Wood has said 
the university wou ld be obligated 
to turn over that information to 
the recording industry if presented 
with formal subpoenas. 

However, Wood said the uni-
versity would not filter access to 
peer-to-peer services, as Sherma n 
has urged campuses to do. 

"While we don 't condone viola-
tion of copyright hold crs' rights, 
we also don't want to interfere 
with a technology that has many 
legitimate uses." Wood stated in 
an e-ma il. "Considering the short 
history of P2P, it is painfully obvi-
ous that any fi ltering wi ll lead to 
additional evasive measures by the 
producers of P2P software. This is 
akin to the 'war' we arc having with 
virus writers - new viruses evolve 
to bypass virus detection software. 
... Filtering will simply drive P2P 
'underground. '" 

Student Legal Services 
Di rector C. Anthony Vallodolid 
sa id his staff has seen many wor-
ried students in recent days, some 
concerned over future suits and 
o thers who are already faci ng legal 
actio n. At this time, Vallodolid is 
planning to schedule a talk with 
a nation al intellectual property 
expert. who ca n provide advice 
for students. 

"The logistics are suc h that it

for students to launch any sort of 
defense," he said. 

The Muir file sharer sa id he 
fears that he may be one of the 
students in the mo t recent wave

Cu~ting-edge UCSD Baldwin New Play 
Festival explodes with fresh talent 

Graduate UCSD M FA theater students write, direct, 
act and design in the nationally acclaimed event 
By OAKLEY ANDERSON-MOORE 

Staff Writer 

YOU are in a mansion. Someone hands you a manini . All an director from Philadelphia Theatre Co. talks about the 
characters in Ruth McKee 's "SOD Words" 
whil e an agent from Helen Merrill eye the 
lead from Josh Tobiessen's " Burnt Out." 
There might be a literary manager talking 
with Tim Lord about his play " II Hills of 
San Francisco" or a rep from \;Villiam town 
talking with Ken Weitzman about his com-
missison for the Washington, D .C. Arena 
Stage. " Is this ew York' Hollywood ' A 
dream?" you ask. Actually, if you are a 
theater student whose talent and persever-
ance got you into the UCSD graduate 
program, then this is the closing reception 
at the Baldwin Mansion for none other than 
UCSD's Baldwin New Play Festival. That's 
how good UCSD graduate theater is. 

Though this writer has never actuallv 
scored an invitation, one can imagine the 
goings-on at the celebra tion for the festival 
that attracts big names in theater from across 
the nation to see the full-length and one-act 
pla)'s written , directed, acted and designed 
by the Master of Fine Arts theater tudents . 
From plays about interns writing essa)'s 
about "What it Means to Be American" to 
a hallucinatory Cripple Children Dream 
Ballet, the festival is chock-full of theater 
that will split your sides with laughter at 
one moment and rip out your heart the 
next at the various performances happening 
between April II and April 23 . 

If you're wary of old dusty plays that 
have to transcend modern times, don 't be! 
Therein lies one of the man)' appeals of this 
festival : All the plays are new. The play-
wrights - all young, promising, talented 
and probably tormented artists - offer 
you plays that are fresh and sa lient, about 
issues you think about, but "News at 5" 
ignores . About jokes itching to be made, 
but "Friends" skips for its affiliates. About 
people who are like you, but Hollywood 
steamrolls with lip-gloss and three-point 
lighting. You will not see the WB's version 
of life, but a sweating, breathing, beautiful 
existence interpolated through the poetics 
of the MFA playwrights. 

For example, third-year MFA Barry 
Levey'S play, "Citizens of Rome," directed 
by Gerardo Jose Rui z, functi on on one 
level as a play about a family - a fucked-
up but eerily familiar one - with fWO 
Jewish-American parents who scream at the 
sight of a Palestinian (Mother: " ... it's nice 
you don't wear one of those .. . burkas." 
Father: "Miriam' he means ... you have 
a pretty face.") and two sons just aching 
to impress/shock their parents with their 
more cultured lifestyles. (One continuously 
adopts crippled children from impoverished 
third-wodd countries, rhe other convinces a 
gay tribal Papua New Guinean, who recites 
"Sex and the City" epicodes he' seen on 
satellite, to invent a traditional Rain Dance 
for the 'rents.) As .the two set out to esca pe 
their parents and Enron-esque financial 
collapse to save Iraq , the play becomes 
about anything from sibling rivalry to ccret 
lesbian adoration to America's role in glo-
balization. 

Levey, who said he starred the pl ay 
as a personal story about fa mily and an 
experiment in structure, inevitably found it 
included themes of a po litical nature. 

"On the first day, [the director] said, 
'everyone in this play has a crusade.' The 
character Najuah articulates a lot of this, 
about how much we screw up trying to fix 
things .. . how always doing that is looking 
down on people and not really relating to 
them as equals," Levey said. 

While normally new plays are normally 
shown in intimate settings like the smaller 

tudio Forum - making it important to 
get your tickets in advance - "Citizens of 
Rome" has the rare privilege of playing in 
the large Weiss Forum, something Levey 
said is both "exciting and terrifying." 

Levey'S play is only one example of the 
complexity, humor, poetics and entertain-
ment that BNPF plays have to offer; space 
forbids discussion of any more examples. 
Here is the bottom line: the Baldwin New 
Play Festival is the most cutting-edge event 
to happen at UCSD, period. The choice 
between seeing another billion-dollar comic 
book movie, playing Halo or fronting 10 
bucks to see a play at the Festival is clear.

Iron and Wine 
Woman King EP 

Sub Pop 

**** YOU wOl~dn 't know it from the mainstream music press, but the 01' U.S . 
of A is. going through some-
thing of a folk revival these 
day. Not the Kumbaya-
around -the-campfire kind 
of fo lk you learned in Girl 
Scouts, but a more mysteri-
ou , sophisticated sound that 
traces as much of its geneal-
ogy to the hill counny of 
Mississippi as to any coffee 
shop in Greenwich Vi llage. 

As the acclaimed Iron 
and Wine, Floridian Samuel 
Beam is on the forefront 

- quality-wise, anyway 
- of the new folk revival. 
W'ith Wuman King, Beam 
rakes a decisive step from 
the moody sparsity of his last 
twO albums, finally accoll1-
panyi ng his ruminations 
with music that matc hes 
thei r emotional intensity. 
Multilayered arrangements 
with exotic percussion, 
slide and electric guirars, 
warm bass and even piano 
make sure his songs groove 
as they muse, developing 
the nuanced rhythms that 
made !lis earlier work so 
rich. Beam's sister, Sarah, 
again supplies gorgeous 
background vocals, aiding 
what seems like a mission to 
soothe us postmodern casu-
alties with the grainy truths 
of domestic life. That this 
EP is such a step for Beam is 
especially evident in "G ray 
Stables," where, for the first 
ti me, Beam steps out of Ius 
reclusive whisper to actu-
ally sing. 

Woman King is full of such 
subtle revelations, which begs 
an imporrant question:, Why 
aren't more ears listening'

Hot Hot Heat 
Elevator 

Sire 

**~ 
Good or not, bands like Green Day and Blink-182 have paved the way 
for other punk groups to go 
pop. The la test entry into 
the punk/pop genre is Hot 
Hot Heat, whose last album, 
Make Up the BreakMwn, was 
acclaimed by fans and critics 
alike - but (not surpris-
ingly) the British Col umbian 
boys' latest release, Eievator, 
is more mainstream-friendly 
and less iIll1ovative. 

Loaded with juvenil e 
energy, Elevator is made up 
of irreverent, happy-go-

lucky songs like its single, 
"Goodnight Goodnight." 
Though their past work was 
heavi ly influenced by '80s 
new-wave, here Hot Hot 
Heat sound more like Smash 
Mouth than the C ure. 

EleV'Jcor does have some 
notewonhy tracks, namely 
"Island of an Honest Man" 
and "Dirty Mouth," but it 
lacks the overall consistency 
of Milke Up the BrtakdinJm. 
T heir previous work was 
punk music that you could 
dance to, but it was also 
intense - who could for-
get the haunting keyboard 
intro to the self-mutilation 
opus "Bandages"? But on 
their new album, H ot Hot 
Heat scrap the keys, and 
replace them with upbeat 
guitar rhythms. The result 
is a mo ntage of skip-worthy 
tracks with trite titles like 
"You Owe Me an IOU" and 
"Rwming Out of Time." 

Al though Elevator is a 
not a huge departure fo r 
Hot Hot Heat , the fol -
low-up to Make Up tbe 
Breakduum fai ls to live up 
to its predecessor.

Tomlab 

**** 

All their efforts failed. Regardless of what idol 
- be it Michael Jordan 

or Stephen Hawking - our 
teachers sta pled to the walls 
of our classrooms, the aver-
age Joe and Jane sti ll hate 
books. Except for a brief 
moment in time - 2003 to 
be exact - passing through 
hip college corners would 
give a hint of hope: "Books 
kick ass man!" "Yeah man! 
Books take YOll places man ! 
Its such a trip!" 

Sorry, Ms. G reenwood, 
the future has fa iled you 

again . 
ill 2003, 17u Lelllon of 

Pink was a manifes to for 
the indie music fan and the' 
music critic alike. T he Books 
perfected the art of splici ng 
their own original instru-
mental recordings with 
nonoriginal sowld sources 
into one coherent voice. On 
paper, this sounds sophisti -
cated and pretentious, but 
the Books transformed the 
experimental avant-garde 
technique of tape splicing 
intO something surprisingly 
accessi ble. T his tradition 
continues with Lost and Safe; 
as a matter of fact, here they 
do it even better. 

T he experimentation 
is still here, but the music 
is even more accessi ble. 
Moments of the record 
even recall indie-pop songs 
in the style of T hingy or 
Pinback. While Lost verges 
on random poetic ram-
blings, the song structures 
are intact and coherent. Ms. 
Greenwood might not get 
the li terary value of Books, 
but she will be del ighted at 
the crea tivity of her pupils.

Third time's a charm for Muir Movie 
IFive the Hard Way' a student affair from start to finish 

By CHRlmNE CLARK 
Staff Writer 

Who said UCSD was a sci-ence school? Various arts and humanities programs on cam-
pus are thriving - including the 
Mujr Movie orgaruzation, which 
will premiere its third annual film 
on April 20 at Price Center. Muir 
Movie was started by a group of 
visual arts students who wanted to 
have the opportunity to make larg-
er-scale (45-minute) productions 
than film classes allow. Although 
John Muir College finances the 
majori ty of the $5,000 project, stu-
dents from all colleges and majors 
are welcome in the organiz.ation. 

This year 's film, "Five the 
Hard Way," was written by visual 
arts. major and John Ml'ir College 
semor Matt Mercer. Mercer also 
co-directed the film with John 
Muir College junior and litera-
ture/writing major Janice Lee. 
"Five the Hard Way" is a drama 
that te lls the story of an insecure 
college stud ent named D avid, 
who uses film as an escape from 
reality. 

"It is basically about a co ll ege-
age guy who is a virgin, and he 
is dealing with the press ure from 
his fri ends to have sex," M ercer 
said . "I wouldn't say it is a moral 
movie. It is just about a guy try-
ing to figure out who he is ... and 
there are a lot of refere nces to 
movies." 

Al though "Five the Hard 
Way" takes pl ace in a college set-
ting, Mercer said that he and the 
other filmmakers made an effort 
to avoid th e cliches associated 
with university life. One way in 
which the filmm akers tried to 
make the film more original was 
by adding a surrealist twist. 

the film." 
Lee descri bed how she and 

the other filmmakers were able to 
use various visual techniques to 
depict the integration of the real 
world and the movie world. 

"There is a sequence where 
[David] is watching a film noir 
and then suddenly [the screen] 
turns black and white and charac-
ters from tIle film come into !lis 
living room and have a conversa-
tion with him," Lee said. 

Although "Five the Hard'Way" 
has avant-garde components, it is 
also a personal film to Merce r. 

"There are elements of the 
story that are based on the expe-
riences I had in college, but the 
plot and the characters are fic -
tional ," Mercer said. 

Lee said shooting the film 
within the college setting had its 
advantages: It gave student actors 

at UCSD the opportunity to par-
ticipate in the film. 

Last year 's Muir Movie dealt 
with adult characters, so the film 
organizers decided to cast profes-
sional actors in the San Diego 
area. However, the 25-member 
cast and crew of "Five the Hard 
Way" consists entirely of UCSD 
students. 

Pre-producti on on t!lis years' 
Muir Movie began in fall 2004, 
with principal photography fin-
ished by the end of winter quar-
ter. Although Mercer and Lee 
- who are still in the process of 
editing the picture - said work-
ing on the film was a lot of hard 
work, they bo th sa id they found 
the experience rewarding. 

"The cast and crew deserve 
the credit. For people who didn 't 
have any prior experience, they 
did a great job," Mercer said. 

"[David] is in an awkward 
stage in his life , so he kind of ge ts 
sucked into the movie world ," 
Lee said. "There are a lot of 
examples where he is watching a 
film and then becomes a part of

Pop art: 
Not just for 

the usual 
suspects 
continued from page 8 

works portray the u e of acrylic on 
circular mediums of paper, canv,ls 
and wood, following the traclition 
of the iconographic silkscreens of 
Andy Warhol. With an understand-
ing that reminds one of pop, the 
artwork and the common images of 
graphic design are integrated to a 
point where the repetition becomes 
a motif and the judgment of value 
becomes impossible. Single images 
that may be familiar are juxtaposed 
in a manner that is far from orclinary, 
and the simplicity of the images is 
broken with the layers of images 
that precede each other, queuing 
toward a Baroque style. From afar, 
McGinness' works fulfill all tastes 
with immediate aesthetic satisfaction 
- bright colors, elegant figures and 
abstract images. A closer approach 
reveals detailed thought prevailing 
in every image placement; simple 
actions, images of flowers, cupids, 
castles and others combine to create 
a narrative commentary. 

The exhibition attracts a diverse 
crowd, portrayed by the dynamism 
of the opening, where skateboarders 
and surfers mingled with th.e high-
art audience. It mimicked the diver-
sity of the works themselves, where 
Rothko and Jeff Koons reproduc-
tions are juxtaposed with popular 
culture representations. McGinness' 
hip audience is not without relief 
in his game; with a following that 
recalls Keith Haring's Pop Shop in 
New York, the artist designs his own 
skateboards, T-shirts, mugs, soccer 
balls and books for purchase and 
has worked on corporate logos for 
MTY, IBM and Sony. 

Another work by McGinness 
- who was described by the New 
Yorker as "one of New York's most 
promising bright young artists" 
- entitled "Beautiful Losers," is 
also in a group show a t the Orange 
County Museum of Art that prom-
ises to satisfy the younger audience 
with its collection; he is also at the 
"Greater New York Z005" exhibi t 
at Public School No. I in New 
York City, jointly organized with 
the Museum Of Modern An. 

McGinness ' work will appeal 
to a much more diverse crowd 
than just the usual art students 
and museum-goers . The exhibit 
runs until May 14. Directions 
and visiting hours of the gallery 
can be obtained at their website :

own. 

UCSD finally gO[ one hit during 
the fourth inning when Maze sent 
a two-run shot over the center-
field fence, scoring fellow fresh-
man infielder Danielle Lukic, who 
reached first base earlier on an 
error by the second baseman. 

"Dunior] Jenny Spencer and 
Lukic. had a huge game." Hurst 
said. 

The Tritons scrambled to get 
two additional hits in the fifth, but 
could not get any closer when the 
UCSD rally finally fizzled out. 

Sophomore Tina Rowe allowed 
six runs on 10 hi ts in over three 
innings of work . 

Rowe took the loss for the 
Tritons and her record fell to 7-8 
on the year. 

Freshman pitcher Nicole 
Fullerton threw brilliantly in her 
three and one-third innings of 
relief, allowing no runs on only 
two hits. 

Game two saw the Tritons 
refreshed and ready to avenge the 
Roadrunners' game-one vi<:tory. 

"The second game was how we 
should've been playing all season," 
Jamie Hurst said. 

Maze gave a masterful perfor-
mance with a pair of singles and 
a wallc. that set the stage for her 
second home run of the day. 

Maze's grand slam over the 
right-field fence gave the Tritons 
an early 4-0 lead. 

"She had a great weekend and 
started the rally - she played 
beyond her gauge," Hurst said. 

Maze walked with one out in 
the third inning and would later 
come around to score the Tritons' 
fifth run on an infield single. 

In order to clinch the game-
twO victory, UCSD then added six 
more runs in the bottom half of

Triton track solid at invitational 
Stalker, Holiday, Lostrom set school records 

By JESSICA NAGER 
Staff Writer 

At the prestigious Rafer Johnson! 
Jackie Joyner-Ker ee Invitational, 
hosted by UCLA pril 9 and Apri l 
10, the Tritons smashed three 
school record while competing 
against Division I schools. Senior 
Lindsay Stalker, sophomore Elisa 
Holiday and junior Carl Lostrom 
ended the competition as school 
record holders. 

\ViIh their success, both of 
the Triton track and field teams 
contin ue to have perfect seasons 
through eight invitationals for the 
women and seven for the men . 

For the Triton women, talker 
et the new school record in the 
I SOD-meter race with a time of 4 
rninutes, 32.35 seconds, ecliRsi ng 
Denis Mcr-ayden's previous record 
of4:32.72,setin 19S . Stalker beat 
her own personal record by nearly 
five seconds and dropped nearly 
eight seconds from her best time 
duri ng the 2004 season. T he race 
also placed her comfortably within 
the N M provisional mark. 

Throughout her race, Stalker 
knew that she was on track for a 
fast time. 

"When I heard the SOO-meter 
time, I made the decision in my 
mind to just push hard and do 
this," she said. "I just decided , 
why not'" 

Stalker is delighted \vith her 
achievement, but is quick to point 
out the entire team's success 
throughollt this eason. 

AndrM Mo/Guardian 
Smashing: Senior Kendra Canape and the Tritons held their own against Division 
I schools at the Johnson/Kersee Invitational on April 9 and April 10 at UCLA 

"I don 't feel like I should 
stand out among this group," she 
said . "Everyone's doing so well. 
Breaking the record is just icing 
on the cake." 

Holiday also set a new record 
in the long jump event with a 
mark of IS fee t, 9.25 inches, a 
full 2.25 inches longer than the 
second-place finisher. Holiday, 
whose mark was worthy of an 

CAA provisional cut, was one of 
only two competitors from outside 
Division 1 that competed in the 
event. 

"My jumping has been get-
ting better and better each meet," 
Holiday said. 

Freshman Emi ly McGregor's 
3000-meter race earned her a 

NCAA provisional mark, as she 
crossed the finish line at \0:06.03 . 
The time is the fourth fastest in 
school history. 

"I didn't go into the race expect-
ing to do anything," McGregor 
said. "Thcre was a lot of com-
petition with a lot of Division I 
schools. I didn't want to get my 
hopes up about making the cut, 
but 1 knew I had to run certain ' 
times, so my coach was yelling out 
times for each lap. I knew I was 
running weIl." . 

For the Triton men, Lostrom 
broke the old school record in the 
3000-meter steeplechase. His time 
of 9 :09.45 crushed the previous

By MICHAEL NEUmDTER 

Staff Writer 

There was no doubt following 
the San Diego City Championships 
at Mission Bay that the UCSD 
men's crew team was more domi-
nant than its hometown neighbors. 
The Tritons swept all four races 
again t University of San Diego 
and San Diego State o n April II . 

The race was originally sched-
uled for April 9, but heavy winds 
forced the coaches to reschedule the 
contest. However, the alteration to 
the schedule wa more than a change 
of days. To avoid problems with any 
of the players' personal obligation 
on April 10, the coaches of each of 
the three schools agreed to hold the 
race on April II at 6 3.m. 

"There was a much different 
atmosphere at the beginning of the 
race than usual," junior and varsity 
oarsman Michael Bravo said. "The 
adrenaline just was not there." 

The teams had to race earlier 
than the originally scheduled S a.m. 
starting time in order to finish before 
classes began later that morning. 

"The race seemed a little like a 
practice," Andres Onetto, senior var-
sity captain said. "The race was lack-
ing the hype of a weekend race." 

The long break between prac-
tice and the race did not deter the 
Tritons. 

"We knew it would be difficult, 

but we knew what we had to do our 
there, " Bravo said. 

T he varsity eight-boat, which 
placed first and clocked in at a 
personal record time of 6 minutes, 
3 seconds, did not let rescheduling 
affect its outcome. 

"We kept a solid mental focus," 
Bravo said. "And the outcome wa 
good." 

The Aztecs tinished in second 
at 6:14, while the Toreros came in 
shortly after at 6: 16. 

"SDSU and USD are both very 
competitive team, but they eemcd 
to have trouble getting things 
together," O netto said. 

T he T ritons also swept all four 
races against both teams in 2004. 

"The main difference between 
our team and their squad is the 
number of quality guys that we 
have," Onetto said . "Al l of our guys 
have the heart ,and spirit to go a 
fast as they can possibly go." 

The varsity fo ur-boat also 
n lrned in si milar results in the 
City C hampionships. T he TritOns 
clocked in at 6:39. U D fini shed 
slightly behind at 6:45 and SD U 
completed the ra e:lt 7 :2 1. 

"The good thing about our races 
is that we knew it was not our best," 
Onetto said. "We left a lot of room 
for improvement."

Tritons split agai'nst No. 5 Chico

Coming out with swinging bats, 
the UCSD softball team split its 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association doublcheader with Cal 

ta te Bakersfield April 9 a t the 
Triton Softball Stadium but were 
swept by Ca l State Dominguez 
Hill s on Apri l 10. 

T he Tritons (15-2 1 overall, 9-
14 CCM) faced tough competi-
tion against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills (33-7 overall , IS-4 CCM), 
who defeated visiting UCSD with 
scores of 11 -3 and 9-3. 

"Cal State Dominguez Hills 
was one of the best teams I've 
cver een, with extremely powerful 
hits," senior team captain and first 
baseman Jamie Hurst said. 

Though UCSD had a 1-0 lead 
in the first inni ng of game one, Ca l 
State Dominguez Hills stepped up 
to the plate with a series of hits that 
culmi nated with a home run . 

The Tritons attempted to rally 
in the top of the fourth, with a 
single run scored, but it proved to 
be short-lived. Game one was cur-
tai led by the run rule after several 
more powerful hits tallied up the 
Cal State Dominguez Hills score. 

Junior right fielder Niki 
Anderson led the TritOns with two 
hits and two RBIs scored. 

"Anderson was very consistent 
- she drove the hits when we 
needed them," Hurst said. 

Freshman starter Melissa Ward 
lasted only 2. 1 innings in thf! game-
one loss. 

Game two closely mirrored the 
proceedings of the opener. 

The Tritons took an early 3-0 
lead in the second inning, cour-
tesy of a leadoff home run by Hurst, 
along with a two-RBI single up the 
middle by senior outfielder Breanne 
Cope. 

Cal State Dominguez Hills 
responded aggressively, sending 10 
batters to the plate and bringing 
home five runs in their half of the 
inning. 

UCSD sophomore starter 
Tina Rowe experienced control 
problems in the frame, and Cal 
State Dominguez Hills capitalized 
on them by walking four times, 
including twice with the bases full , 
and benefited from a costly UCSD 
error to keep tlle inning alive. 

Though Rowe was temporar-
ily reinvigorated after the second 
inning, the fifth and sixth innings 
were again marked by losses with 
four Cal State Dominguez Hills 
runs scored during that stretch. 

Sti ll , freshman third baseman 
J enny Maze managed to pace the 
Tritons with two hits, while start-
er Rowc threw six innings in the 
loss. 

After dropping game one 6-
4, the Tritons made up for lost 
ground in game two and eventually 
defeated Cal State Bakersfield (25-
17 overall , 13 -S CCM) by an 11 -0 
margin in five innings. 

Although Cal State Bakersfield 
managed to get several runs in 
game one, the Tritons managed to

Fierce opponents in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
A~sociation, No. 10 UCSD and 
No.5 Chico State battled for vic-
tory in their four-game serics on 
April 9 and April 10. On Apri l 9, 
the Tritons took the opener 5-3 
while the Wildcats stole the sec-
ond game, 12-3 . 

On April 10, for the second 
consecutive afternoon, the Tritons 
and Wildcats split their double-
header. The T ritons inched out 
game-one over the Wildcats 5-4, 
but dropped the nightcap 7- \. 

In the first game, UCSD soph-
omore catcher David Morehead 
continued to swing the hot bat 
with a two-run home run, his sixth 
of the yea r, to left field to give 
the Tritons (22- 12 overall, 17- 10 
CCM) a quick 2-0 lead in the 
first inning. 

The Wildcats (25 -8-1 overall, 
IS-7 CCAA) did not trail for long, 
however , as they posted three runs 
on four h~ts in the bottom of the 
second inning to take a 3-2 lead. 
Chico State added another run to 
its lead in the bottom of the fifth 
when Wildcat shortstop Jorge 
Araiza singled home first baseman 
Jesus Bravo. 

With two outs in the UCSD 
sixth, senior shortstop Keith 
Hernandez walked and junior 
outfielder Matt Lawson singled to 
center field, advancing Hernandez 
to third. Senior first baseman 
Brian Robinson then delivered a 
double to left-center field, allow-
ing Hernandez and Lawson to 
score and knot the game at 4-4. 

Triton junior pitcher Ryan 

Leake (4-2) came on to pitch the 
sixth inning and shut down the 
Wildcats in the frame . 

UCSD senior third baseman 
Alex Gascon delivered the go-
ahead single in the seventh inning. 
After senior second baseman Ricky 
Pinocchio led off the UCSD sev-
enth with a single and advanced to 
second on senior outfielder Craig 
King's sacrifice bunt, Gascon sin-
gled through the left side, plating 
Pinocchio and in turn putting the 
Tritons back on top 5-4. 

T riton senior closer Shlomo 
Lipetz pitched UCSD out of a jam 
in the final frame to earn his sixth 
save of the season. 

In the second game, Chico 
State used a five-run fifth to earn a 
commanding lead in what was pre-
viouslya tight game.The Wildcats 
won the game 7- 1 and earned the 
four-game series split. 

With Chico State leading 1-0 
in the fifth, UCSD junior hurler 
Jose Navarro (2-3) recorded two 
outs before allowing fWO morc 
Wildcats to reach base. Lipetz 
came in for the Tritons, but this 
time Chico State posted the big 
hits. Wildcat pinch hitter Jay 
Hyland smacked a three-run 
home run off of Lipetz and put 
the Wildcats up 4-0. Just two 
batters later, Chico State's Jorge 
Araiza homered down the left-
field line, putting two more runs 
on the board . 

T he T ritons were held score-
less through six and narrowly 
missed being shut out as they 
recorded a si ngle run in their half 
of the seventh .

season baseball poll , the Tritons
