Che Cafe supporters marched across campus during the annual Founders’ Day celebration, 
chanting against the organization’s eviction from its historic location and protesting tuition hikes.

A vigil was held on Nov. 13 in the 
Revelle Plaza to mourn the disappear-
ance of 43 students from Ayotzinapa 
Teacher Training College. 

Approximately 200 people attended 
the event in hopes that the 43 students 
are still alive, since sufficient evidence 
proving otherwise has not yet surfaced. 
The students were abducted on Sept. 
26 because of their participation in the 
march to honor the 1968 Tlatelolco 
student massacre.

Mariko Kuga, Student Initiated 
Access Programs and Services co-
coordinator for UCSD’s Student 
Promoted Access Center for Education 
and Service, and other organizers dis-
tributed flowers and candles to the 
individuals who attended the vigil. The 
flowers and candles were placed by 
the photos of the 43 students. Once 
the candles were distributed, the ros-
ter which contained the names of all 
43 students was read and the crowd 
responded with ‘presente’ after each 
name was said. 

Public commentary was then 
offered, and a variety of individuals 
from different ethnic, educational and 
social backgrounds spoke of their feel-
ings and the unity which the vigil 
brought. An emphasis was placed on 
the idea that the disappearance of these 
students affects all people, regardless 
of who they are and where they come 
from, and, because these 43 individu-
als were students, that this affects the 
UCSD student body in a more per-
sonal manner. 

When asked what the main goal 
of the vigil was, Kuga explained that 
it was necessary to provide solidarity 
and to represent all groups on campus. 

“There wasn’t really a goal other 
than to bring students together that 
feel like-minded,” Kuga said. “[The 
vigil] is hitting a lot of members of our 
community very personally, obviously, 
[and the goal] was to offer people 
space to grieve, to reflect, [and] to 
process.” 

Individuals from the community 
who spoke at the event discussed sev-
eral issues, including the similarity in 
the progressive elimination of pub-
lic education by state and university 
authorities, along with their personal 
experiences with oppressive govern-
ment institutions. 

The vigil concluded with a perfor-
mance by UCSD sophomores Sinnai 
Avila and Francisco Javier Garcia, who 
sang a song which illustrated the politi-
cal struggles and oppression which 
the disappearance of the 43 students 
represents. 

When asked how she felt about the 
turnout of the event, Avila explained 
that although it was in response to a

Annual Hullabaloo Festival Draws Over 5,000
Performances by Logic and Erik Hassle mark the largest Hullabaloo celebration to date.

BY   Bryn na  Bolt
staff writer

The fourth annual Hullabaloo fes-
tival took place on Friday, Nov. 14 in 
Town Square and Matthews Quad. 
The event, put on by Associated 
Students Concerts and Events, was 
geared toward undergraduate UCSD 
students and followed the Founders 
Day Celebration that had taken place 
in Price Center and Town Square ear-
lier that day. 

ASCE Festivals Director Sean 
Kennedy estimated that the turnout 
for the event was the largest in its 
history, with over 5,300 students who 
collected wristbands for the attractions 
and over 7,000 who attended. 

“This was our biggest Hullabaloo 
yet,” Kennedy said. “It was really great 
seeing so many UCSD students come 

together and have such a great time. I 
also really want to thank all the volun-
teers and staff members who gave up 
so much of their time and put a lot of 
effort into this event.”

Hullabaloo festivities began at 8 
p.m. and transformed the well-known 
space into a carnival-themed extrava-
ganza complete with rides, food and 
concerts. 

The concert component of the 
event was highlighted with perfor-
mances by Logic, Erik Hassle, Conway 
and UCSD student disc jockey Avery. 
All of the artists appeared on a stage 
stationed in Town Center, across from 
the Student Services Center.

Headliner Logic, who appeared at 
UCSD only two days after performing 
on The Tonight Night Show Starring 
Jimmy Fallon, drew the largest crowd 
out of all the Hullabaloo artists. This 
was Logic’s first time performing songs 

mainly from his new album, “Under 
Pressure.”

Furthermore, the night featured 
all four rides previously advertised by 
ASCE, and the lines for a zip line, the 
Kamikaze, the Zipper and the Round 
Up stretched throughout Matthews 
Quad. 

A variety of foods from vendors 
such as King Kream, California Kettle 
Korn, Cheesy Amigos and Famoso 
Tacos, winner of Triton Fest’s Taco 
Throwdown 2014, were available for 
purchase by Hullabaloo guests.

Student organization booths also 
accompanied the other festivities, and 
ASCE will be giving out cash prizes 
for the most creative booth design, 
best booth activity and a raffle that 
the booths could enter.

Hullabaloo is one of the many

Members of the Che Cafe organized a march throughout campus on Friday, Nov. 14 to protest university plans to close the coop-
erative’s facility. The protest began at 11 a.m. with 
approximately 50 people in attendance and continued 
for approximately three hours.

The protesters met at the Che Cafe and proceeded 
through Library Walk, past the Hullabaloo stage in 
front of the Student Services Center, Price Center, the 
UCSD Bookstore and by PC Ballroom East. Outside 
of the event, members and supporters of the Che Cafe 
chanted phrases including, “Long live the Che!”, “Let 
us in!”, “Chancellor Khosla needs to go!”, “Tuition 
hikes have to go!” and “The Che united will never be 
divided!”

In addition, members of the collective stopped at 
each location and held speeches telling students that 
the eviction of the Che Cafe affects all of them. They 
discussed how the eviction reflects the gentrification 
of the UC system, which they believe is also illustrated 

in the UC Regents’ proposal to raise tuition by 5 per-
cent each year for the next five years.

Che Cafe core member and UCSD alumni Rene 
Vera stated that he believes the protest will bring 
awareness to the campus about the collective.

“I definitely think [the protest] will make a dif-
ference,” Vera told the UCSD Guardian. “I mean, 
we definitely saw an upsurge in participation during 
our last rally in terms of students just paying atten-
tion, in general, to what’s going on, and we’re hoping 
that by getting people to just notice us to then begin 
participating in what’s going on and realizing that this 
affects them.”

In their last meeting, A.S. Council voted to amend 
the Che Cafe resolution it passed on Oct. 29. The ini-
tial resolution created a committee to investigate the 
Che Cafe collective and  facilities and calling upon the 
University to refrain from issuing an eviction notice 
until the committee completed its investigation. 

A.S. President Robby Boparai proposed amend-

A group of UCSD students hoping 
to become the first such organization 
of any university to launch a rocket 
into space has set a launch date for 
late March.

The Triton Rocket Club made 
headlines around San Diego last week 
as word spread that the group is aim-
ing to launch a 20-foot rocket 62 miles 
into the air next year. A successful 
launch of this caliber would be the 
first for any exclusively student orga-
nization.

TRC President Nico Montoya says 
that, while this specific rocket project 
has only been in the works for a year 
and a half, the club has moved toward 
this goal by building progressively big-
ger rockets since 2011.

Montoya, a mechanical engineer-
ing major, told the UCSD Guardian 
that he marvels at how far the group 
has come after working “literally from 
the ground up.”

“Just two years ago, the club 
was operating out of my Keeling 
Apartment in Revelle, and I was pay-
ing for rocket parts out of my own 
bank account,” he said. “This is defi-
nitely possible for anyone to do — not 
just launch a rocket into space but to 
do any cool project.”

TRC has secured funding for its 
upcoming project through NASA, 
Northrop Grumman, Lockheed 
Martin and the Jacobs School of 
Engineering, among others.

TRC’s two-motor rocket will 
employ an initial and delayed propul-
sion technique that group organizers 
hope will be enough to bring the rock-
et into the goal range of 328,000 feet. 
Upon descent, the rocket will deploy 
two parachutes to slow it down before 
hitting the ground. TRC’s rocket will 
also employ GPS technology and a 
GoPro camera to give a live visual and 
data feed for the rocket’s position.

“We’re doing research into live data 
acquisition so we can see where the 
rocket is after the launch,” TRC Vice 
President and Chief Engineer Danny 

Shin said.
GPS data for the rocket will be 

critical for official determination that 
TRC is the first group to send a rocket 
to space.

“The GPS is our meal ticket,” 
Montoya explained, adding that it will 
be impossible to see the rocket’s actual 
location from the ground after it rises 
only a few thousand feet. Club mem-
bers will need to stand at least a mile 
away from the actual launch site.

The group most recently placed 
second in a University Student Rocket 
Competition after working on a proj-
ect that took seven months. NASA 
also helped fund TRC’s project for that 
competition through the California 
Space Grant Consortium.

Since that competition, Montoya 
said, the group has run several stat-
ic, ground-based launches and has 
worked to develop its own motors, 
rather than purchasing commercial 
motors.

“That’s a big step that we take: to 
actually mix the chemicals for a motor 
ourselves,” Montoya said.

Project Manager of TRC’s 
Propulsion Team Jared Shapiro said 
that the group hopes this project will 
help boost the prestige of both the 
membership of TRC as well as the 
university.

“For the Jacobs’ School and UCSD 
as a whole, this will be huge,” Shapiro 
said. “We’re hoping this will get com-
panies like Boeing to see us up there 
with MIT and Stanford and put UCSD 
on their top feeder schools.”

For the March launch project, TRC 
will travel to an open desert in north-
ern Nevada, near where the annual 
Burning Man festival is held. Nevada 
is the only state where all such launch-
es take place, according to TRC.

The actual launch date is yet to be 
determined, though TRC is planning 
to take its membership to the site dur-
ing the weekend of March 27.  The 
group will run its next static launch 
early next year.

ments to the resolution, calling upon 
the Che Cafe to refrain from meet-
ing at the facility until the ASUCSD 
committee reached a conclusion, 
which passed by a vote of 17–11–3. 
During the meeting, Boparai said 
the reason he issued the amend-
ments was to maintain A.S. neutral-
ity on the issue.

In regards to the committee 
formed by A.S. Council, Student 
Sustainability Collective representa-
tive and Che Cafe ally Eden Berdugo 
told the Guardian that the Che Cafe 
does not have the time needed for 
the committee to reach a decision.

“I think the committee that was 
formed is really great. I hope some-
thing will come out of it. The down-
side is that it takes time. One hour 
a week, it’s going to take a couple of 

weeks to figure all this out,” Berdugo 
said. “They’re saying that the resolu-
tion is just in time for the commit-
tee to figure it out, but, you know, 
it might take weeks, it might take 
months and the Che doesn’t have that 
kind of time to wait for this commit-
tee of people who don’t even repre-
sent the Che to decide their fate.”

That same evening, Vice 
Chancellor - Student Affairs Juan 
Gonzalez issued a statement con-
cerning the Che Cafe and the coop-
eratives. In the statement, Gonzalez 
said the University supports student 
organizations such as the Che Cafe.

“The university strongly sup-
ports the campus co-ops and the 
important experience they provide 
to our students,” Gonzalez said. 
“We are committed to ensuring the 
continuation of the student coop-

eratives, including the Che Cafe 
Collective. We want the co-ops to 
thrive and be successful.”

Gonzalez also stated that the Che 
Cafe space must be vacated, but the 
University has no plans to demolish 
the facility.

Furthermore, the statement said 
students may have to cover the 
repair costs of the Che Cafe.

“The student governments and 
the student body will play a criti-
cal role in determining the future 
of the Che facility,” Gonzalez said. 
“A student fee referendum may be 
required to fund the renovation 
should the student governments 
decide to support the building.”

that although it was in response 
to a terrible action, it elicited passion 
from the student body.

“The students that were taken 
in Ayotzinapa and the five percent 
tuition increase in the UC system, in 
the end it’s all correlated; it’s all sys-
temic oppression toward students,” 
Avila said. “I really like how a lot of 

students are here gathering because 
they recognize the oppression and 
like, in the end, we’re all connected 
— this is something that is affecting 
all students.” 

Garcia commented that regardless 
of whether one is a student of Mexico 
or California, this event is directly 
affecting everyone.

“I’ve been noticing a very big trend 
of the century, this time, this gen-
eration, where everything is coming 

to an extreme climax where they’re 
either going to turn for the worst or 
the best,” Garcia said. “The turnout 
here is beautiful because with death is 
life, and this brings a lot of life about 
what’s going on within society. Too 
many things are coming together that 
are affecting us directly [and] we can’t 
stand on the sidelines anymore [and] 
just ignore those things.”

Hullabaloo ended around 11 p.m., 
just after the completion of Logic’s 
performance.

This Wednesday, Nov. 19, the University of California Board of Regents will be 
voting on the “five-year tuition 
and fee stability plan” that has been 
proposed by UC President Janet 
Napolitano. This plan would 
establish fee increases up to 
5 percent for the next five 
years, amounting to about 
27 percent in total, con-
tingent on the expected 
4 percent UC alloca-
tion received from 
the state. It would 
be implemented 
the next academic 
school year, mean-
ing our annual 
tuition would rise 
up to $16,000 by 
the 2019-20 school 
year. Financial aid 
officers and the 
UC Office of the 
President continue 
to reassure students 
that receive financial 
aid that they will not 
be impacted. However, 
it seems like the word 
“impact” has a different 
meaning to students than to 
the UCOP.

UCOP describes this plan 
as something that all students 
and families from all levels of study 

could budget for. It’s impor-
tant to remember that financial 

aid in the UC system involves 
loans and work-study — a few 

things that aren’t feasible to all 
UC students. In the UC system, 

tuition only makes up about half 
of the cost. The reality is that 

aside from tuition, the cost 
of living in California and 

room and board are just 
a few other things that 

students worry about. 
For some time now, 
UCOP has lacked the 
understanding of the 
true impact of its fis-
cal decisions on the 
student body. 

For many years, 
the University of 
California Student 
Association has 
worked on many 
campaigns and 
supported legisla-

tion that lobbies for 
funding from the 

state. Campaigns like

Associated Students VP External Allyson Osorio calls students to action to 

protest the proposed 5 percent tuition hikes on Tuesday, Nov. 18. 

Depriving an individual with terminal illness of 
the right to die in the way they choose is a violation 
of their human rights. The issue of assisted suicide 
is first and foremost one of autonomy. That is, we 
ought to respect the capacity of rational individuals 
to make informed, uncoerced decisions concerning 
their own life and well-being. The most recent 
National Public Radio-Truven Health Analytics 
Health Poll shows that 55 percent of responding 
Americans favor physician-assisted suicide for 
people with less than six months to live. Measures 
should be taken to ensure that public policy 
reflects this opinion. “Death with Dignity” allows 
terminally ill individuals to choose to end their lives 
using lethal medications rather than experiencing 
unnecessary and often enduring amounts of pain 
due to disease.

Twenty-nine-year-old Brittany Maynard, whose 
story was recently featured by CNN, elected to 
utilize Death with Dignity in light of her diagnosis 
of brain cancer. She made an informed decision on 
the matter, accounting for various grim details of her 
future with the disease, including the fact that she 
“could develop potentially morphine-resistant pain 
and suffer personality changes and verbal, cognitive 
and motor loss of virtually any kind.” 

As others in her position would likely conclude, 
Maynard preferred to face death on her own 
terms — peacefully, painlessly, in her right mind, 
in her own time and surrounded by loved ones; 
rather than despondent suffering, pumped full of 
drugs and surrounded by medical professionals. 
When faced with a terminal illness and insufficient 
palliative care, Death with Dignity is a reasonable 
and, for a good number of patients, a preferred 
method of treatment. It is not a treatment that 
should be denied to anyone who chooses it as their 
best option.

‘Death with Dignity’ Are Grave

Regulating Assisted Suicide Becomes Dif-
ficult, With Too Many Possible Motives

‘Death With Dignity’ Is a Protection 
of  Individual Rights and Autonomy 

After a recently married, 29-year-old woman 
facing terminal brain cancer ended her life on 
Nov. 1, new debates have been sparked about 
legalizing assisted suicide. Brittany Maynard 
relocated from California to Oregon, one of five 
states where the act is legal. Death with Dignity, 
an organization advocating for dying individu-
als’ right to choose death, is pushing Maynard 
as the poster example of why assisted suicide 
should be an option. Regulating assisted suicide 
throughout medical institutions is problematic. 
There is too much room for corruption within 
its institutionalization for this to be a widely 
accessible option.

People with debilitating illnesses fear a loss 
of autonomy more than pain and suffering. The 
annual 2013 report from the Oregon Public 
Health Division reported that 93 percent of 
people seeking assisted suicide were troubled by 
a loss of autonomy. The inabilities to function 
independently and feel productive and valuable 
are huge concerns. As sick patients rely on rela-
tives for simple tasks, they fear being financial 
and emotional burdens.

When regulating assisted suicide, it is dif-
ficult to tell whether people are fighting for 
the right to die or the duty to die. On CNN 
Maynard said, “I probably would have suffered 
in hospice care for weeks or even months ... I 
did not want this nightmare scenario for my 
family.” The fact that she considers her contin-
ued existence to be a nightmare for her family is 
significant. Many disabled and elderly folk expe-
rience a loss of autonomy and still enjoy life.  
The legalization of assisted suicide pressures ter-
minally ill people to die painlessly and cheaply, 
without burdening society.

For a country such as the United States to 
provide  its citizens the right to die would be a 
betrayal of two of the nation›s most prized values 
established upon independence. Life and liberty, as 
endowed by a Creator, would surely be infringed 
upon through the federal legalization of assisted 
suicide.

It should be self-explanatory that suicide in 
any form is an affront to the sanctity of life, but 
right-to-die activists will argue about one›s ability 
to avoid the deterioration of life. But really, what 
quality is there to find in a state of nothingness and 
existential decay?

Furthermore, while the choice to die may seem 
appealing to those concerned with human liberty, 
what additional freedom is truly gained when 
human life ends? In death, one no longer has the 
choice to see their family anymore. They›ll never 
experience emotions of nostalgia and love ever 
again. About 200,000 years of human existence 
has given no clue as to what happens in death, but 
what is definitive is that the freedom associated 
with one›s right to life will come to naught.

And beware the slippery slope. In 2013, 
around 40 people in the Netherlands were allowed 
euthanasia for mental illness. The year before, two 
conjoined twins from Belgium chose euthanasia 
over loss of sight. As for the United States, the 
death rate from assisted suicide in Oregon has 
increased by four to five times since the state law 
passed. 

Don’t be fooled by right-to-die activists and 
their Orwellian attempts to convince the American 
people that death is life. Their exploitation of 
Brittany Maynard›s assisted suicide — a hardship 
best left to friends and family, not political activists 
and the news cycle — is yet another product of 
America›s culture wars.

A.S. Council 
Needs to 
Take Lead 
on Che Cafe

soren  nelson 
senelson@ucsd.edu

point of order

Here’s the thing about the Che Cafe closing: Most people don’t really care. 
Now, before you start writing me 
an angry email, let me clarify what 
I mean. Students don’t understand 
why they should care. They don’t 
know what the organization does, 
why its history is significant or 
why, as the cooperative’s leaders 
have so passionately argued, we 
should fight to keep the building 
operational — and that leaves A.S. 
Council in a difficult position. Let’s 
talk about why that is.

A.S. Council is ostensibly the 
student body’s voice. Ideally, we 
serve as a voice for groups who 
wouldn’t normally be heard and 
work to protect students’ rights and 
experiences on this campus. With 
the variety of groups and interests 
present on this campus, agreeing 
on the best way to do that isn’t 
always easy. Supporting the Che 
Cooperative outright is difficult 
for a variety of reasons, a fact that’s 
frustrating to both members of 
Council and the Cooperative. 

The first and perhaps most 
obvious reason is that, following 
the court’s ruling in favor of UCSD, 
neither A.S. Council nor the Che 
Cafe were in a strong position to 
argue that UCSD doesn’t have the 
right to evict. Secondly, there’s a 
lack of political will on Council 
to stick out our proverbial neck in 
defense of the Che. Irrespective of 
the Che’s history and value as an 
institution, it isn’t one that reaches 
many students. In fact, as a fourth 
year in the very same college that 
houses the Cafe, I didn’t even know 
it was an operational building 
until the Cooperative and UCSD’s 
administration started butting heads 
last spring. Ultimately, this comes 
down to political capital. With the 
future of Sun God Festival in the 
balance and A.S. Council once again 
strapped for cash, A.S. Council has 
to use discretion in which issues 
they choose to champion. Frankly, a 
UCSD without Sun God is a lot more 
painful to imagine than a UCSD 
without a functioning Che Cafe. 

So what comes next? The 
administration has offered the 
Che alternative venues — none of 
which appear to be satisfactory. 
A.S. has hesitated to fully back the 
Cooperative and likely will not end 
up doing so. Everyone is frustrated. 
But as with all difficult situations, 
strong leadership and cooperation 
can turn this into an opportunity 
for growth. 

At its best, A.S. Council is an 
intermediary between students and 
UCSD’s administrators. We’re a 
group of students who understand 
not only what students want and 
need but what motivates UCSD 
administration to do what it does. 
A unified council has the power 
to bring people together to find 
solutions. If you were waiting for 
a time to show us what you’re 
capable of, Council, now is the 
time. Whether or not we want 
to put our support behind the 
Che, we have a responsibility 
to facilitate a conversation that 
protects the cooperative’s right to 
operate on campus while meeting 
the university’s mandate to keep 
students safe.

ucsdguardiancontinuously disinvested in higher education. We’ve seen rapid growth in prisons yet not nearly enough 

growth in the future of California. 
This disinvestment in higher edu-
cation does not mean current and 
future students should be paying the 
price, but it does mean something 
is not working in California. Where 
are our priorities and how can we 
bring balance into the arenas that 
need help? 

The UCOP should not be using 
students for the $98 million budget 
gap. Instead of just being political 
pawns, students should have a seat 
at the table with UCOP and the 
UC Regents on a plan that could 

bring growth into the availability, 
accessibility and quality of the UC 
system. Closing the budget shortfall 
should fall on the responsibility of 
the UCOP, the UC Regents and the 
California Legislature — not on the 
backs of students. The Master Plan 
is failing all Californians and it’s 
time everyone works on this issue 
as a collective unit.

Just because we are the best 
public education institution does 
not mean we can’t be better. We 
should not be comparing our-
selves to other institutions if we 
really want to bring innovation and 
growth to the state of California. 
At UCSD, we learn to work hard, 
produce research and indulge in 
our networks. If students can do it, 

UCOP and California can do the 
same to figure out this gap without 
students’ money. Does it really cost 
more than $12,000 for us to attend 
a UC school? 

The students of California in all 
three tiers of higher education have 
brought a lot to the state. It is time 
the state and the UC system work 
together to bring something back 
to the future of California.

Please join us on Tuesday, Nov. 
18, at 11:30am on Library Walk 
for our “sit-in” to show everyone 
in California that all students will 
indeed be impacted. It’s not on us 
to fund the UC system.

Burden of  Funding the UC System Does Not Lie with Students

Best of San Diego

Best Fancy Date Restaurant:

One of the first stops for any informed traveler who is 
just arriving from a long flight to America’s Finest City 
is Little Italy, the perfect locale for date night (or day). A 
quaint neighborhood just east of the airport, Little Italy 
boasts some of San Diego’s tastiest spots for cultural cui-
sine, perhaps the most prominent of which is Mona Lisa, a 
small deli with an adjoining Italian market that makes for 
the perfect place to take someone special. Whether you’re 
looking for some authentic Italian pasta or a traditional 
sandwich filled with top quality ingredients, this restaurant 
is a pristine example of San Diego at its best.

— Sam Shapiro

Mona Lisa
Best Place to Go for Tacos:
Oscars Mexican Seafood

Hole in the wall eateries never let me down when it comes to 
quality food, and Oscar’s Mexican Seafood doesn’t disappoint. Just 
a quick to drive to Pacific Beach or Hillcrest, Oscar’s and its casual, 
beachy vibe will compel you to order one of their fish tacos. While 
their menu is a bit limited, they master everything they sell. The 
spicy shrimp tacos and especial tacos — fish, shrimp and scal-
lops — will have your mouth watering for more. Beware, though: 
at rush hours, they take a while to serve your food. However, that 
means your tacos will be fresh and even more satisfying — that is, 
if you don’t forget to pile on their special sauce. I can guarantee 
Oscar’s will be a staple for you and your friends. 

   — Rosina Garcia

Best Place for Family Brunch:
The Cottage

What better way to welcome your family than to show them 
the creme de la creme of La Jolla? The smell of fresh, deli-
cious entrees wafting throughout the street will lead you and 
your family to The Cottage, where brunch aficionados will find 
fluffy stuffed French toast topped with strawberries and bananas 
as well as drool-worthy eggs Benedicts. Surrounded by white 
picket fences and colorful flowers, its cottage-like ambiance is 
truly one of a kind. Seating is limited, so come early on week-
day mornings as the wait can get quite lengthy. The Cottage is 
sure to have your family coming back for its quaint ambiance 
and delectable items.

Best Place to Go For Nightlife:
The Tipsy Crow

Whether it’s dancing, drinking, playing board games or a little 
bit of it all, The Tipsy Crow is the ideal spot for an exciting night 
downtown with the crew. Located on the corner of Fifth Avenue 
and F Street (the very heart of Gaslamp), the Tipsy Crow boasts 
three floors for entertainment, each with its own distinct vibe. 
Five dollars gets you into the main floor where bartenders can 
pour draft beers or fix you a cocktail, and those looking for the 
bass can drop it low in the basement. Music features a healthy mix 
of fresh EDM and select ‘90s throwbacks that get everyone sing-
ing along together. When the night is winding down, you can chill 
upstairs while waiting for your ride to come or head out across the 
street for your next adventure!

Best Place to Go Sightseeing:
La Jolla Cove

La Jolla Cove, a picturesque cove with scenic vista points and 
shops, is the perfect place to take your family while visiting San 
Diego because it has something for everyone in the family. For 
the adventurous, there’s scuba diving and snorkeling, and for the 
shopaholics, the nearby boutiques are a pleasant diversion. There 
is also a variety of multicultural sit-down restaurants that have 
something to offer for anyone’s craving, be it Indian food, tacos 
or sushi. The Cove also offers breathtaking views of the ocean, 
especially during sunset, which are an Instagrammer’s paradise. 
And let’s not forget that no trip to the Cove is complete without 
visiting The Chocolate Factory and Haagen Daz for dessert!

Best Family Attraction:
The San Diego Zoo

Home to over 4,000 rare and exotic animals from an 
impressive variety of species, it’s no surprise that the San 
Diego Zoo is considered one of the city’s best attractions 
for families. Open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day of the 
year, this zoo is unlike any other your family will ever 
experience. Start off your visit with a Skyfari and soar 
above 100 acres of lush wildlife that the zoo boasts. If 
you are traveling with younger guests, take advantage 
of the uniquely interactive Animal Encounters scattered 
around the park. These range from designated petting 
paddocks to scheduled appearances made by endearing 
“animal ambassadors.” With so much to offer, a visit to 
the San Diego Zoo should definitely be on every family’s 
checklist of sights to see at Balboa Park.

INDULGE Best Place to Go for Dessert:Extraordinary Desserts
After your romantic candlelit dinner, close out the 

night with a romantic candlelit dessert extravaganza at 
Extraordinary Desserts. Extraordinary Desserts offers a 
broad and intimidating array of scrumptious confections, 
from fruity cakes and fudge bars dripping with chocolate 
to minty creme brulees and bread pudding accented 
with gold-tinted petals and fruit sauce. Both locations 
offer a cozy, intimate setting for the dual task of soulful 
gazing and cake-gorging. Mind the portions, however; 
Extraordinary Desserts is notorious for its challenging 
serving sizes. Though it’s perfect for paired binging Lady 
and the Tramp-style, be careful not to spill raspberry 
sauce on your date’s clothes in your enthusiasm.

Best Place to Go for Boba:
Tea Station

If you look for that quality tea taste in your boba fix, drop 
everything and head to Tea Station right now. A great option for 
all San Diegans, Tea Station’s a local joint in Mira Mesa, Kearny 
Mesa and El Cajon. Though pricier than your average Tapioca 
Express, you’ll find that each delicious drink at Tea Station is 
individually crafted and made to order with your choices in levels 
of sweetness and ice. The menu offers a variety of Chinese dishes 
and you can enjoy your drink in a tall glass mug if you opt to eat 
in with friends. Granted, the service can be slow and may not 
always be top notch — which tends to lower their Yelp ratings — 
but their tea (and their perfectly cooked boba) never disappoints.

— Lauren Koa

Best Place to Go for Coffee:
Bird Rock Coffee Roasters

If you’re looking to impress a coffee snob with your in-depth 
knowledge of gourmet coffee and brewing techniques, this might be 
the place to do it. This famed coffee joint houses Direct Trade coffee 
from all over the world that is micro roasted (roasted in small, exact 
batches, then water-cooled) to perfection, producing coffee so flavor-
ful, it’s more than worth its Starbucks-level prices. The Pacific Beach 
location enjoys a comfortably large space, replete with enormous win-
dows that open into the street and it welcomes performers to its open 
mic sessions throughout the day. It’s the perfect atmosphere for a nice, 
casual afternoon date.

came up just short of a double-
double with eight points and nine 
rebounds. Redshirt freshman guard 
Taylor Tanita came off the bench to 
put up an impressive 16 points, five 
assists and three steals. 

“Taylor is an excellent point 
guard with tremendous instincts,” 
VanDerveer said. “She is so poised 
while being aggressive and she’s only 
going to get better and better. I am 
very excited about Taylor.”

It was a tight game all along, with 
the biggest lead coming in the first 
half when the Tritons led 36–23 with 
six minutes left in the period. How-
ever, University of Mary quickly ral-
lied back to take a 45–44 halftime 
lead. The rest of the game remained 
close, with 18 total lead changes and 
14 ties recorded throughout regula-

tion play. 
Playing through a tightly contest-

ed, back-and-forth second half, the 
Tritons found themselves down 75–73 
with half a minute left in play. On the 
Tritons’ final possession, sophomore 
guard Beth Mounier pulled up from 
beyond the arc for a game-winning 
shot but fell short. However, Shokoor 
came up with the clutch offensive 
board and dished it out to Bertsch 
who tied things up with 21 seconds 
left in regulation to ultimately send 
the game into extra play. 

In overtime, it was guards Seto 
and Tanita whose clutch play made 
the difference, as the duo combined 
for 10 of the Tritons’ 14 points. The 
14–9 advantage in overtime scor-
ing was enough to hold off Univer-
sity of Mary. Forward Brittney Dietz 
scored a whopping 35 points for the 
Marauders and fellow forward Sloan 

Turner added a double-double with 
11 points and 12 rebounds.

UCSD, now with a fresh 1–0 re-
cord to start its campaign, will travel 
next weekend to the West Region 
Crossover Classic hosted by West-
ern Washington University. The first 
game is scheduled for Friday, Nov. 
21 against Seattle Pacific University 
at 5 p.m., before the Tritons move on 
to play Western Washington the fol-
lowing day at 7:30 p.m.

“We have to really grow from the 
[next] couple of weeks,” Vanderveer 
said. “We are going up to play against 
an excellent Western Washington 
team. For a young team, [we have] to 
have people play together and trust 
each other so we can get in a rhythm 
both offensively and defensively.” 

Tritons Will Now Travel to Play in West Region Crossover Classic

in play, the Tritons managed to 
level the score thanks to Bauman’s 
coolly converted penalty kick after 
CSULA committed a handball pen-
alty inside their penalty area.

Overtime could not produce 
a winner, forcing the Tritons to 
again decide the fate of their season 
through penalties. Seniors Jacob 
Valedez, Bauman and Palano all 

converted their kicks in the shoot-
out. With the season on the line, 
McElresh, who made a career-high 
six saves all game, did manage to 
rescue UCSD’s chances with a div-
ing save when the Tritons were 
down 4–3. 

“He was great all night made a 
couple of big saves and two penalties 
I believe,” Pascale told the UCSD 
Guardian. “He did everything you 
could ask for with a keeper.” 

Ultimately, however, it was 
CSULA’s Beigarten who stole the 
win for the Golden Eagles as he 
made the winning save from sopho-
more midfielder Riley Harbor’s pen-
alty shot to officially send UCSD 
home. 

“I couldn’t be more proud to 
be part of this team to be honest,” 
Bauman said. “Overall, we played 
with a lot of heart; everyone worked 
their butt off. It was a team effort 
and a great last game.”

UCSD finishes the season with 
a 10–4–6 record and impressively 
progressed to yet another NCAA 
championship despite losing 10 
senior players to graduation a year 
ago and five players to season-end-
ing injuries.

“It doesn’t surprise me that it 
ended in a tie and went to a shoot-
out,” Pascale said. “Credit to Cal 
State L.A. You never want to end 
a season, but we can walk off the 
field knowing we gave everything 
we had.”

being aggressive and getting into the 
paint to make the right play is the 
positive stuff we can build on.” 

UCSD had an uncharacteristic 
night from beyond the arc, going 25 
percent on only 12 attempted three-

pointers, in contrast to the 32 three-
point attempts they had against 
Loyola Marymount last week. UCSD 
averaged almost 25 three-point at-
tempts per game last year, making 
this the first time the team has shot 
12 or less from downtown since the 
2011–12 season.

“We shoot the ball well, but we 
also want to take what is given to 
us,” Olen said. “They kind of got into 
and pressured us in their defense.”

Freshman guard George Buaku 
got the nod to start the game at the 
point over fellow freshman forward 
Jordan Flannery, who started the 
game at Loyola Marymount. Buaku 
finished with four points and three 
of the team’s five assists.

“Similar to the whole group, [the 
freshmen] had their good moments 
and moments where they struggled,” 
Olen said. “We want to use it as a 
tool to grow and learn as a team and 
individually in particular so when 
they are in similar situations, they 
can try and build on those moments 
when they had success and learn 
from the mistakes to move forward.”

Junior forward Treavon Fran-
cis was the only Triton to finish in 
double digits, scoring 10 points in 
15 minutes. Junior forward Drew 
Dyer added seven points and two 
rebounds in 19 minutes.

With the preseason behind them, 
the Tritons will officially tip off their 
season on Wednesday, Nov. 19 when 
they travel to San Francisco to take 
on Academy of the Art University.

ful and disguised Prince Albrecht. When

of heartbreak. Albrecht must then face 
the consequences of his careless seduction 
when confronted by the Wilis: vengeful 

spirits of spurned lovers who roam the 
forests for unsuspecting men to slaugh-
ter. Giselle’s misguided love for Albrecht 
is the nobleman’s only hope for salvation.

Despite finding new life after earning an unexpected bid for nationals, the UCSD’s men’s soccer team was eliminated in the first round of the NCAA Division-II Championships on 
Thursday evening after being defeated by Cal State Los Angeles at the 
Cougar Soccer Complex. For the second straight match, the Tritons 
fell to opposition in a penalty shootout, as the final score was 1–1, 
before the Golden Eagles won 5–4 on penalty kicks. 

UCSD nevertheless put up a valiant effort in the disappointing loss, 
forcing the match to go into extra play on a clutch-tying goal with only 
minutes left in play. 

“This was a hard-fought game where both teams played really hard,” 
UCSD head coach Jon Pascale told the UCSD Athletics Department. 
“The game had its ebbs and flows.”

The Tritons made their second consecutive NCAA appearance as 
the sixth seed, while CSULA qualified as third seed. The difference in 
ranking failed to show on the field, as both teams created chances early 
in what would be an even tilt throughout. 

Three minutes in, senior Golden Eagle midfielder Abel Teferi 
forced a diving save from UCSD’s junior keeper Cameron McElfresh 
with a long distance curling shot. Sophomore striker Sam Palano came 
closest for the Tritons in the first half, as he had two scoring opportu-
nities. In the ninth minute, Palano picked up a loose ball just outside of 
the box, his right-footed shot was saved by CSULA senior keeper Mike 
Beigarten. With ten minutes left in the half, Palano was once again 
denied when he broke free on the right hand side but failed to finish.

In the 43rd minute, the Golden Eagles came closest when junior 
forward Andre Bissmark’s low, right-footed shot was tipped on to the 
post by McElfresh to keep the half-time score level.

Both sides continued to see chances in the second period, but it was 
not until the 75th minute that either team found the net. Senior mid-
fielder Shane Panther tucked away a smart finish from inside the pen-
alty box to put CSULA ahead 1–0 and claim his second goal of 2014.

Despite the late deficit, UCSD’s captain, senior midfielder Brandon 
Bauman, capitalized in the clutch. With less than four minutes left 

After falling to Loyola Mary-
mount University by one point last 
week, the UCSD men’s basketball 
team was thwarted again in exhibi-
tion, as Division-I opponent UC 
Riverside defeated the blue and gold 
by a score of 75–52 this past Satur-
day at SRC Arena. The loss served as 
the final preseason game for the Tri-
tons, who will open up their regular 
season this week. 

The Riverside Highlanders came 
out strong, taking an early nine-

point lead in the first half. The Tri-
tons, however, would regroup and 
answer back with six of their own 
points to keep the game within 
reach. 

Despite some point-blank misses 
around the rim, UCSD was able to 
hang around in the game with the 
help of sophomore guard Adam 
Klie, who scored seven of his total 
nine points in the first half. He also 
grabbed a team-high five rebounds 
on the night. Both teams used their 
strong defensive performances to 
keep the score low and close going 
into intermission, with UC River-

side holding a slight 29–24 edge. 
“We did a good job attacking the 

basket,” UCSD head coach Eric Olen 
told the UCSD Guardian. “We had 
some opportunities, and we made 
some good decisions with the ball 
when we got it in the paint, whether 
that was to kick it out for a jump 
shot or trying to finish it at the rim.”

UC Riverside would run away 
with it in the second half however, 
going on a 21–0 scoring run to blow 
out the Tritons. A huge alley-oop 
dunk got the crowd into the game 
and swung the momentum in favor 
of the Highlanders. In the seven-
minute stretch, UCSD committed 
four turnovers and missed all eight 
of their shots.

UC Riverside’s pressure defense 
took away the three-point shot and 
forced the Tritons to drive the ball 
to the lane. UCSD had trouble fin-
ishing in the paint due to strong rim 
protection by UC Riverside’s junior 
forward Taylor Johns, who recorded 
five blocks in the game. 

“Not all of our good decisions 
resulted in points,” Olen said. 
“Whether somebody didn’t finish, 
or their big man blocked a shot. But

WOMEN'S  BASKETBALL

Tritons Win in Overtime
Basketball opens regular season with 89–84 victory. 

The UCSD women’s basketball 
team officially opened up its 2014–
15 season with a thrilling victory 
on Saturday afternoon. The Tritons 
traveled to the 2014 Tip-Off Classic 
hosted by Cal State San Bernardino 
and defeated University of Mary 89–
84 in overtime.

“It was a very good opportu-
nity for us to play lots of different 
combinations,” head coach Heidi 
VanDerveer told the UCSD Guard-

ian. “We are playing a lot of young 
kids since we have six seniors but 
also six newcomers. It was kind of 
like a reality check, and we passed it 
and can learn a lot from this experi-
ence.”

UCSD pulled through with well-
rounded performances across the 
board. Senior guard Miranda Seto 
(20 points, six rebounds and four 
assists) and senior forward McKen-
nan Bertsch (17 points, six rebounds 
and three steals) led the way, while 
junior forward Farrah Shokoor
