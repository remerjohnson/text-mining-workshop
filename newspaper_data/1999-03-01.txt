Thief Apprehended at RIMAe 
CRIME: Police arrested a man who 
allegedly stole wallets and personal 
items from the men's locker room 
By Nliou Mostoll 
Senior Staff ~ter 

Since the beginning of the 1998 fall quarter, 
15 wallets have been reported stolen from the 
men's locker room at RIMAC, according to the 
Feb. 23 UCSD Community Alert Bulletin dis-
tributed by the UCSD Police Department. 

The alleged thief, a 42-year-old man who is 
not a UCSD affiliate, was arrested at RIMAC on 
Monday for the recent burglary of wallets, 

watches, J.D. cards and other personal items 
from locker rooms. 

This suspect was arrested last year at San 
Diego City College for committing similar 
crimes at City College and UCSD; once he was 
in jail, the thefts ceased at both schools. 

UCSD Crime Prevention Officer AI Jenkins 
said that when the crimes started again this year, 
the UCSD Police felt that this suspect may once 
again be responsible 

"[We) thought maybe it was this individual 
and distributed his photo to the RIMAC staff," 
Jenkins said. 

On Monday, the police found a person match-

C. R.E.A.T.E. was initiated a, a r.::,ult of 
a 1997 report by the UCSD Task force on K-
12 Outreach. One of the goals of 
C.R.E.A.T.E. is to estahlish partncrships 
with local schools. 

Leventhal said he created ASOP to work 
wi th C.R.E.A.T.E. to increase student-inill -
ated outreach. especially outreach done by 
separate student organilat ions rather than by 
the university itself. 

ASOP consists of three parts: an outreach 
database, outreach projects and outreach 
scholarships. 

The outreach database wi ll organi lc and 
coordinate all student-initiated outreach pro-
grams currentl y run by student organi7.a-
tions. The database will be housed in the 
A.S. Volunteer Connection office on the sec-
ond floor of the Pri ce Center. 

The econd part of ASOP consists of OUt -
reach projects. Leventhal said that outreach 
projects wi II be organi led each quarter by the 
A.S. Council members and participation will 
be encouraged among all UCSD students. 

During fall quarter, the A.S . Counci l will 
sponsor a College Application Assistance 
Program at Sweetwater High School and 
Crawford High Schools to help students 
complete their UC applications. 

During winter quarter, UCSD students 
will visit all nine schools in the current K-12 
partnership to help maintain and improve 
the physical appearance of the schools. 

During spring quarter, the A.S. will host 
a Future Leaders Program that will target 
students taking leadership classes at Horace 
Mann and National City Middle Schools. 

The Future Leaders Program, scheduled 
to take place during the third week of spring 
quarter this year, will provide students with 
a tour of the campus, lunch and time to 
break into groups to work on various prob-
lem solving projects.

CalPIRG Releases Report 
ENVIRONMENT: VCSD and VCI students protested 
in front of the Arco Gas Station on Miramar Road 
By Abby Holcomb 
Guardian Reporter 

Eight California Public Interest 
Research Group (CALPIRG) mem-
bers from UCSD and UCI gathered 
on Wednesday morning at the Arco 
Gas Station on Miramar Road to 
release their new environmental 
report , "No Refuge: The Oil 
Industry's Million Dollar 
Campaign to Open Up the Arctic," 
detailing the involvement of oil 
companies in the Arctic region and 
their dealings with Congress in an 
attempt to legally open the region 
for drilling. 

Speaker Simrun Kalra, UCI 
CalPIRG member, said they hoped 
that the press conference would 
increase awareness. 

"We hope to create more aware-
ness of the politics of what's going 
on in the Arctic and what people 
are trying to do to prevent it." Kalra 
said. 

The repon names oil companies 
ARCa, Exxon. Chevron and BP-
Amoco as the "Dirty Four" due to 
their record of pollution' and envi-
ronmental destruction. The report 
states that these companies have 
contributed a total of $11.7 million 
to candidates for Congress and to 
Republican and Democratic cam-
paign funds since 1993. in order to 
sway votes to open the coastal 
plain of the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge. 

The Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge consists of a total of 1.5 
million acres of wilderness located 
on Alaska"s northern slope. 
Currently. the region remains 
untouched and is home to a variety 
of animals. 

The report states that Exxon, the 
largest oil-company in the world, 
has donated almost $2.5 million to 
congressional candidates . since 
1993. The report also states that 
Chevron and ARCO have donated 
$2.6 million and $3 million, 
respectively. 

The report states that groups 
other than CalPIRG have also 
opposed these four oil companies. 
The CalPIRG's report states that 
polls from around the country indi-
cate that the majority of the 
American public opposes drilling 
in the Refuge. 

Some members of Congress 
have also responded to the report 
by proposing and sponsoring a bill 
that would forever ban drilling in 
the Arctic region. the Mo Udall 
Arctic Wilderness Act. The two 
major supporters of this bill are 
Rep. Bruce Vento (D-MN) and 
Sen. William Roth (R-D). 

To support the claim that oil 
companies "are engaged in a 
multi-million-dollar effort to cor-
rupt our democracy and destroy an 
American treasure." the CalPIRG 
report not only gives the figures of 
how much money each oil compa-
ny has given to the government. 
but also gives the names of repre-
sentatives that are taking the 
money. 

The report states, "members of 
Congress who did not co-sponsor 
the Udall Wilderness Act received 
almost 15 times as much money as 
their colleagues who did." 

The report states that all that is 
needed for large oil companies 
such as ARCO to begin drilling in

ay ..... 1Um 
Staff Writer 

Last Wednesday. A.S. President 
Joe Leventhal delivered a State of 
the Campus Address to a large 
crowd at the Price Center. This is 
the lirst time that an A.S. president 
has given a State of the Campus 
Address. 

As the A.S. president. Leventhal 
said he feels that communicating 
with the students of UCSD is 
imponant. 

"I felt that a forum where stu-
dents are updated on the work of 
the council was needed, and I also 
wanted to provide students with 
feedback," Levenftlal said. 

In his speech, Leventhal spoke 
about some key issues concerning 
the student body such as 
Affirmative Action. 

He said that even though 32,000 
students applied to UCSD last year, 
there were only a small number

involved in outreach. Two $500 
scholarships will be awarded each

Leventhal said that Vice 
Chancellor of Development James 
Langley has agreed to fund the 
scholarships for the lirst year and 
possibty set .p a funding structure 
for fUlilre scholarships. 

Le~enthal said that he designed 
ASOP panly because outreach was 
currently in effect but not ' recog-
nized or coordinated. 

"It basically stemmed from rec-
ognizing the need," Leventhal said. 
"People on campus and people in 
C.R.E.A.T.E: understand that out-
reach is being done but not being 
coordinated." 

Leventhal said that ASOP is get-
ting a positive response from others 
on campus. 

"I think it's being very well 
received as a whole," Leventhal

applicants from undenepnIIented 
groups. 

In an attempt to deal with this 
problem, Leventhal said the A.S. 
Council has created the Associated 
Student Outreach Project (ASOP). 
Under the new proje,,'l. the A.S. 
Council coordinates outreach 
effons to high school students in 
underserved areas. 

Through the program, the coun-
cil will also offer scholarships to 
undergraduates involved in public 
service activities aild 'organize a 
special day called "Future Leaders 
Program:' during which high 
school students can visit UCSD 
and attend classes. 

Leventhal also addressed the 
lack of parking for students on 
campus. He said the council is cur-
rently surveying students to evalu-
ate their reactions to the parking 
situation and to effectively respond 
to their concerns. 

Leventhal also spoke about 
Triton Tide. a new student organi-
zation. He said that the A.S. coun-
cil created Triton Tide to boost 
school spirit by encouraging alten-

said. "I am excited about the pro-
ject and the enthusiasm council 
members have expressed." 

Espinoza visited three schools 
that UCSD has partnerships with, 
Otis Elementary School. National 
City Middle School and 
Swectwater High School. Espinoza 
said that as a regent. it was impor-
tant for him to see first-hand what 
outreach was being done by the 
University of California. 

"( felt it was important for me as 
a regent to reilly heal from parents, 
students, teachers and administra-
tors in the schools we are working 
with to see whether or not we are 
meeting the community's needs," 
Espinoza said. ''The visit to the 
partnership puts a real faith in the 
regents' outreach discussion." 

Espinoza said that after visiting 
the pannership sChools. he realized 
the significance of UCSD's out-
reach to those schools. 

"We are making a signiticant 
impact in terms of providing assis-
tance to these schools." Espinoza 
said. "I asked one of the adminis-
trators at one of the schools how 

dance II .ahletic events and giving 
out free T-shirts. 

"As president, I placed high pri-
ority on making the A.S. visible 
and providing feedback," he said. 

Leventhal said his final goal as 
A.S. president is to get the pro-
posed A.S. constitution passed. He 
said the new constitution changes 
the structure of the senate, and 
makes it more powerful . . 

Leventhal said that when he is 
faced with many decisions, he 
always tries to follow his personal 
morals. 

"I want to always stand behind 
my values and beliefs, politics can 
be a jeopardizing career, but noth-
ing is worth jeopardizing my 
morals and beliefs," he said. 

Leventhal's term ends the fifth 
week in spring quarter, but he said 
the lessons he has learned as A.S. 
president will always remain with 
him. 

"While being president, I 
learned to always do what's right, 
and in the long run, that's where the 
rewards will come," Leventhal 
said. 

they would be impacted if UCSD 
was not involved in the school. The 
administrator respond¢ that it 
would be a drastic loss to the-
school if UCSD was not involved." 

Espinoza said that while he was 
not familiar with the specifics of 
ASOP, it seemed that it would be a 
successful program. 

"From what I know of the pro-
posa~ it seems like a step in the 
right direction in terms of coordi-
nating existing student-run effons 
IIId expaadinR student-run activi-
ties and involvement in outreach," 
Espinoza said. 

Muir Junior Senator Jennifer 
Lee, who visited the schools with 
Espinoza, said that visiting the 
schools was important to her. 

"If you really go out into the 
community, you realize that there 
are so many aspects to outreach." 
Lee said. "It's totally different 
going out there and seeing the 
schools. You see what exactly is 
going on there."

meeting, after Leventhal presented

PINION 

ouded Rainbow of 

America must address and confront the 
subject of homosexuality by fighting 

• society's homophobia and ignorance 
through television and tolerance 

• 

By Robert O'Lury 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

On Feb. 10, 1999, Jack McPhee, a Capeside. 
High School student, was forced to read his 
poem out loud in English class. His poem con-
tained the words "shackles of guilt" in reference 
to amorous feelings about a sexualized mascu-
line image. 

The reading of this poem lead to rumors 
throughout Capes ide that both changed the town 
from picturesque to scary, as homophobic acts of 
harassment disrupted the usual peaceful flow of 
life, and made television history. 

This scenario occurred on "Dawson's Creek," 
the television show that defines the genre of teen 
soaps after "My So Called Life." Shown by 
Warner Brothers, "Dawson's Creek" caters 
directly to a teen audience. The Feb. 10 episode 
could be the first time in television history that a 
major network addressed teens in such a direct 
manner on the subject of homosexuality and dif-
ficulties involved in the coming-out process of 
gay youth. 

The character Jack McPhee (Kerr Smith) was 
created this season and quickly developed into a 
major pan of the show's world. Over the course of 
two episodes, audiences watched Jack and his 
counterpal1S exploring the standard discourses in 
pop-culture surrounding homosexuality. 

,.{Iong with the pop-discourse, an intriguing 
theme and several fresh perspectives were 
explored - the inculcation of gender roles, an 
anti-stereotypical and very supponive reaction of a 
straight male to his friend's possible gayness, the 
girlfriend's reaction to her partner's coming ou! 
and a religious figure 's belief in tolerance and love 
when addressing diversity. 

A disturbing trend of hatred disguised as con-
cern is both illustrated and opposed through I;XBm-
ining the way in which "Dawson's Creek" 
explores issues surrounding homosexuality in pop-
culture and juxtaposing it to an episode of 
"Talkback," a live debate forum on CNN in which 
a proposal for warning labels on shows with 
homosexual content is discussed. 

Format changes in "Dawson's Creek" exem-
plify the show's discussion of homosexuality as 
it affects teen life through societally established 
gender roles. Dawson (James Van Der Beek), the 
character through whom the audience usually 
views events, faded into the background. Pacey 
(Joshua Jackson), Dawson's best friend, took a 
stance against the English teacher's cruelty, 

. which was perfectly characteristic of the 
"earnest juvenile" character. Joey (Katie 
Holmes) and Andie (Meredith Monroe), Jack's 
girlfriend and sister respectively, were the girls 
whose thoughts were explored - both had 
mixed feelings. While they were kind and want-
ed to help and provide love, neither -had a reac-
tion as specifically defined as the boys, who 
seemed to hive a premedita~ed, programmed 
response.

IDI'I'OIIIAL: 
Advertising insert 
sparks Guardian. debate 

As the mainstreall' student 
newspaper at UCSD, the Guardian 
is contacted daily by people who 
want to advertise their products, 
servil.'CS and ideas to the student 
body. As a newspaper funded 
solely by advertising, the 
GuordiDn recognizes the impor-
tant role advertisers play in cre-
ating our product: Without 
advertisements there would be no 

. Guordian. 
However, Guardian editors also 

recognize the responsibility we 
have toward the newspaper's read-
ers, contributors and advertisers 
not to publish any fonn of infonna-
tion that is blatantly false or offen-
sive. Therefore, when the business 
office receives requests to run con-
troversial advertising of an ovenly 
political or moral slant, the 
Guardian's executive board, which 
is comprised of all of the newspa-
per 's editors andthe business man-
ager, carefully considers whether 
or not to run ads on a case-by-case 
basis. 

Enclosed in this issue of the 
newspaper readers will find an 
advenising insert titled She '.f a 
Child. Not a "Choice . .. It contains: 
a series of photogrdphs; descrip-
tions of a child's developmental 
cycle in the womb; a legal history 
of abortion; details about abortion 
procedures and testimonials by 
both women who chose adoption 

and women who chose abortion 
and laler regretted their decisions. 
Not surprisingly, this information 
is not conveyed in an objective 
manner. The insert clearly falls 
into the "pro-life" area of the polit-
ical spectrum and renects the 
ideals of the group that paid for its 
publication. 

-GUARDIAN-
EDITORIAL 

Publishing this advertisement 
was not a decision that the 
Guomian staff took lightly. We 
chose to accept the insert at a staff 
meeting. Only after much debate 
and a majority vote by the execu-
tive board did the advertisement 
run. The board strives to exclude 
tinancial considerations and per-
sonal political bias when making 
its decisions about advertising, and 
focuses instead on the nature of the 
advertisement. We ask ourselves 
one basic question: Is this some-
thing we want to print in our news-
paper'! 

Though many editors had reser-
vations about the advertisement, 
especially its photographs, we 
chose to accept the insen because 
it contributes one voice to an 
important debate. As is the case 
with all advertisement and opinion 
articles, She 's a Child, Not a 
.. Choice" does not necessari Iy 
reflect the opinIon of the 
Guardian, its editors or other 
advertisers. However, to refuse all

controversial advertising that some 
or all members of the board might 
not support politically would be 
doing a disservice to Guomian 
readers. 

As UCSO's main newspaper, 
the Guomion has a responsibility to 
confront the issues and engage in 
controversy. We strive to provide a 

forum for the circulation of a 
wide range of ideas. While we 
don't accept all advertisement 
- such as one ad by a group 
claiming that the Holocaust 
never happened the 

Guamian executive board chose to 
print She '.r a Child, Not a "Choice" 
because it contributes infonnation 
and a perspective (though in an 
admittedly biased manner) to a 
legitimate debate. Whereas most 
people would disagree with anyone 
saying that the Holocaust never 
occurred, this insert reflects the 
views of a large percentage of our 
population. 

Furthermore, although we at the 
Guardian recognize our responsi-
bility toward our readers and con-
tributors, we do not feel the need to 
protect them from controversy. 
The UCSD community is com-
prised of intelligent adults, who

issue can one make a fully

possibility of gayness has already 
been considered by the boys, 
whi Ie the girls are confronting it 
for the first time. 

A possible answer lies in a 
quintessential social gathering 
of young people, commonly 
known as "recess." While not 
belittling the cruelly that exists 
in the semi~gender-segregated 
world of "the playground" 
among young girls, the deroga-
tory epithet "faggot," which in 
junior high seems to evolve into 
the more specific term "cock 
sucker," flies from mouth to 
mouth almost exclusively 
among boys. Homophobia 
infects the relationships of 
young men at an early age, while 
leaving young girls virtually 
untouched. The different reac-
tions to Jack's possible homo-
sexuality are gender based. 

After establishing this theme, 
the writers use the character of 
Pacey to refute it as they explore 
the perspective of a valiant 
straight male's reactions to a 
friend's possible gayness. This 
perspective is shown to be one of 
kindness, forthrightness and 
gumption. Rather than chastise or 
harass Jack, Pacey responds 
directly to what should be a more 
important issue, the cruelty of an 
adult placed in a position of 
power over young people. In 
standing up for Jack, Pacey faced 
serious jeopardy, including 
course failure and social 

In the following week's 
episode, Jack came out to his 
girlfriend, Joey. This encounter 
allowed the writers to explore 
the girlfriend's reaction. Joey is 
scared and confused, though 
loving and gentle. She both 
makes light of her boyfriend's 
possible gayness and addresses 
him seriously and lovingly on 
the subject. Joey is Jack's most 
intimate companion and inter-
acts with him kindly. She exem-
plifies a new and loving per-
spective in the coming-out 
process. 

By far the most engaging per-
spective explored is one of which 
the audience is only shown a 
glimpse. As juxtaposed in previ-
ous episodes to her liberal grand-
daughter, Grams (Mary Beth Peil) 
attends church regularly, quotes 
scripture and disapproves of her 
granddaughter's more liberal 
leisure-time activities. She's an 
unlikely advocate for tolerance 
and love of diversity. 

Though Christianity has been 
known to be used as a justifica-
tion for homophobia before, 
Grams recognizes the message 
of universal love that her reli-
gion preaches as being of the 
utmost importance. As the only

KEEP THE HOLY WATER. COMING RAINBOW: 'Dawson's Creek' 
writers test genre 

Living off campus has both its 
advantages and disadvantages . 
You get more space. but you have 
to drive to school every day. You 
get more privacy. but you have to 
maintain and fix everything your-
self. You get your mail right at the 
door. but you also get electricity 
and water bills. Well. most people 
get water bills. The City of San 
Diego. in its inlinite wisdom. has 
decided not to mail water bills to 
our home. but instead. to send us 
"Shut-Off Notices." 

My first experience with this 
phenomenon happened last year. 
two month ~ or so <lfter my room-
mates <lnd I first moved in. An 
offi cial-looking piece of mail 
arri ved from the city, with the 
ominow, words "Final Notice" 
printed on the envelope. 

Upon opening the leller. we 
were Informed that our payment 
was past due. <lnd our water wou Id

hypothetical "First." "Second" or 
"Penultimate Notices" implied by 

t h l ~ pll!l:C 01 writ. and wc had. in 
lact, never even. received anything 
of the kind. This reve lation failed 
to get rid of the "Final Noticc" cur-
rently in our po~ses~ ion . however. 

Since our p<lyment was pa~t due. 

it was too late to mail our check. 
The only way to keep our faucets a-
flowing was to make payment at 
one of the city's automated kiosks 
called the Water Department. 

This minor calamity happened 
to occur coincidentally with lhe 
World Series. and the only operat-

it had suspended the formality of

picking and tax-payer frustration to 
be included here.

thousands of crazed baseball fans-
turned motorists as his car crawled 
past 'the stadium to the kiosk, then 
back home to repon success. 

We then called the almighty 
Water Depanment and informed it 
that we had placed a meager ofler-
ing at one of its electronic altars, 
and asked lor mercy and a contin-
ued supply of life-giving water. The 
depanment sternly informed us that 
we were bad citizens and a burden 
to society: we agreed heanily and 
swore that we had seen the error in 
our ways (even though as far as we 
could tell we hadn 't done anything 
wrong). and it grudgingly decided 
to spare us an excruciating death by 
dehydration. 

We breathed a collective sigh 
of relief and considered the mailer 
dosed. A lillie more than a 
month 's time passed before anoth-
er "Final Notice" arrived. 

This one conveniently occurred 
during Christmas break. when we 
were all gelling ready to leave. This 
time we called the Water 

bill to the 
last resident 's new address," the 
Water Department concluded at last. 

"WhatT we asked in conster-
nation. "That 's the stupidest thing 
we've ever heard! Why the hell 
would you forward a utility bill ..... 
We paused a moment as a thought 
occurred to us. "Have they been 
paying the bills?" 

So much for that idea. 
This second crisis was resolved 

by performing a ritual similar to 
the first , although by this time it 
had lost its novelty. Again the 
Water Department deigned to leave 
our water. on and assured us that it 
would change the name on the 
account and prevent any further 
forwarding sHenanigans. Two 
months of uneasy calm passed 
without any word from our friends 
at the city. We were all plagued by 
that unnerving trepidation you feel 
when you know that there's a tiger 
nearby that should be making all 
kinds of purring tiger-noises, but is 
instead being conspicuously silent.

About a week ago, we received 
yet another shut-off notice from 
the city. I reacted to this news by 
loudly' invoking the name of a pop-
ular western deity and beseeching 
Him to condemn' the minions of 
the Water Department to that 
unwholesome part of the scorch-
ing-hot afterlife (this may suggest 
a rather lengthy speech, but I great-
ly simplified it by using some 
choice four-letter words.) This 
time the shut-off date is set for my 
21st birthday. I guess I will have to 
seek some alternative to water for 
liquid refreshment that evening. 

We have done everything in 
our power to stop this madness, 
but the city has maliciously foiled 
us at every' tum. We have tried to 
find a mutually benelicial way to 
remedy this situation, but to no 
avail. We are left with no choice 
but to take the following action:

This is your "Final Notice." 

Our records show that you have 
failed to mail us a water bill. It is 
now too late to expect payment by 
post. In order to avoid payment 
shut-off and a $5 service charge, 
you must collect payment in per-

receipt of this notice. Payment col-
lection services arc between 2 
p.m. and 3 p.m. on weekdays only. 
We recommend calling to make a

ing in line.

After hearing her granddaugh-

Christianity as a justification for 
his dislike of homosexuals, and 
Jack specifically, she says, "If 
Jack is gay he does not need your

needs from you, from me, from 
everyone else in this world is love 
and tolerance .... Save judgment

to show Christianity as a motiva-
tor for "tolerance and love" rather 
than "judgment," the writers 
refute the claim that Christianity 
can be used to justify homopho-
bia. 

Addressing the issues sur-
rounding homosexuality in stan-
dard pop-culture rhetoric and the 
possible implication of homopho-
bia infecting males at an early age 
is not at all revolutionary or the 
least bit original. The show's 
exploration of ridicule in the lives 
of gay teens or God's word heing 
used as justification for prejudice 
and hatred is not new either. 
However, addressing these issues 
on "Dawson's Creek," a show 
catered to teens on a major net-
work, is a noteworthy event in 
television history. The writers 
seemingly stepped outside of their 
own, not-yet-solidified genre.

RAINBOW: 
Dangers need labels 
not differences 
c." •• "- ...... 

Through examination of the 
influence homosexuality . plays on 
teen relations. it can be seen that 
such material in this contexl both 
transcends and redetines the genre 
of teen soaps to include the issues 
surrounding homosexuality. 

Youth are constantly facing 
new obstacles and, in doing so. 
learning more about thelllliClves. 
Strangely enough. by the time they 
reach adulthood they appear to be 
even more confused. Less than a 
week afler the airing of Jack's 
coming-out episode, on a live 
CNN broadcast Feb. 22. 1999, a 
debate was waged on the appropri-
ateness of a "Homosexual 
Content" warning label for televi-
sion programs. 

Here. the effects of gender 
roles in a heteronormative society 
were not nearly as important. It 
was interesting, however. that the 
main advocate for the content 
label was a male, and the main 
speaker against it a female. 
Instead, religiou5 beliefs and the 
environment in which one is 
raised became strong themes in 
the afluments for and against this 
proposal. 

A representati ve from a 
Christian activist group attached 
his plea for the warning label to 
good child rearing_ He said that 
whether or not people like it. some 
parents don't want their children 
watching programs with homosex-
ual content. and that a warning 
label would better facilitate their 

parenting. 
Joan M. Garry, executive 

director of the Gay Ii Lesbian 
Alliance Against Defamation 
(GLAAD), said that she wants her 
three children to learn to celebrate 
divenily, not just tolerate it. She 
went on to say that it's important 
for children to grow up with 
respect for the people around 
them. She also said that she would 
agree to a "Sexually Explicit 
Content" label, but not to one 
directly targetinl homosexual 
content. Garry said that some reli-
gious-rite believen use their voic-
es to create and re;nforce preju-
dice in this country. 

John Valenti, a representative of 
the Motion Picture Association, 
said in reference to the proposed 
"Homosexual Content" warning 
label: "It's a proposal that ought to 
be ignored. I don't think there's any 
chance of it becoming reality -
Zero." 

This proposal, however, should 
not be ignored. It should be taken 
seriously, as it illustrates a danger-
ous trend in our culture. that 
"hate." when hapilazardly wrapped 
in a guise like the concern and love 
for chiklRn. is perfectly accept-
able. The haphazard quality of this 
guise is clearly visible in the tenn 
"waminl label" used by all in this 
debate, though S:lJ'IIIgely addressed 
by none. 

There is no need for a warning 
label on something that is differ- ' 
ent, just something that is danger-
ous. 

This is a world where words 
are used to categorize people by 
race, ethnicity, gender, class. 
political affiliation and sexual ori-
entation. along with many other

labels. 
The term "homosexual" exists 

to categorize people into yet 
another socially constructed eth-
nicity. The existence of the word 
itself attests to the seemingly 
innate human need to separate the 
world into categories. This need 
to categorize appears to be some-
how linked to the fears that we, as 
humans, have about anything or 
anyone perceived as different 
from ourselves. This fear. when 

left unchecked, can tum to hatred . 
In such a world it is good to see a 
show such as "Dawson's Creek" 
sinking its teeth into a social cat-
egorization like homosexuality 
and spitting out, piece by piece, 
the possible impetus for the igno-
rance and banality of a prejudice 
known as homophobia for the 
younger generation to see and be 
appalled. 

As demonstrated throughout 
history, prejudice doesn' t just stop. 
h has to be addressed and confront-
ed again and again to halt its 
spread. A responSe to this contin-
ued exercise in hate and bigotry 
must be made to say that such an 
evil will not be tolerated by the 
people of this world. 

Frighteninlly enough, some of 
the people in the audience for the 
CNN debate, who were not making 
or endoning the proposal for a 
"Homosexual Content" television 
rating and considered themselves 
neutral on this issue, failed to see 
the Underlying hatred such a pr0-
posal illustrates. We all must raise 
ourselves into a state of awareness 
about what goes on around us, 
about what our friends and 
acquaintances say and do and about 
what our leaders are deciding. 

"Dawson's Creek" serves as a 
touchstone for both teen-specific 
issues and those of society at large 
in the United States_ As such, it 
both retlects and comments on our 
culture. 

In its representation of a queer 
youth's coming out, "Dawson's 
Creek" shows a kindness and sen-
sitivity, the importance of which 
may be difficult to see outside of 
this process. But by televising the 
coming-out process of a thought-

ful, intelligent teenager, America 
can see what gay teens every-
where go through and how kind-
ness and sensitivity can make this 
difficult and taxingjoumey a lillie 
easier. 

By identifying itself with 
Hamlet and his epic journey in its 
title phrases. "To be or not to be: 
that is the question," "Dawson's 
Creek," and Jack himself, is iden-
titied with the thoughtful, intelli-
gent young prince adrift in a 
usurped, now poisoned world, 
that he was destined to lead. In 
quoting the speech's fint line, the 
rest of that thought is implied, 
being: 

'1'0 be, or not to be: that is the 
question: 

Whether ' nobler in the mind to 
suffer 

The slings and arrows of outra-
geous fortune, 

Or to take arms against a sea of 
troubles, 

And by opposing end them'!" 
The show answers this question 

with a definite "yes." 
It is necessary to suffer ridicule 

and to oppose a series of obstacles 
seemingly endless in number when 
the battle is for something as 
important as personal freedom and 
the inalienable rights of every indi-
vidual. 

Everyone has things they need 
to deal with. and all youths must 
make the journey into adulthood. 
But during the joys and trials in our 
own lives we mustn't forget the 
importance of tolerance. We must-

. n't forget to take the time to cele-
brate the diversity that surrounds 
us.

Floyd said he encounaes stu-

the Police Department in finding

Jenkins also gave some tips on

of Education 
The Teacher Education Program offers UCSD 

students a chance to reach out to the next 
generation of university scholars and gUide 

them toward higher education 

• 

Since 1991, UCSD sludenls have IUlored low income, under-served children around the cily as part of lhe Partners al Learning program (P.A.L.), encouraging kids who mighl nol nonnally go 10 college 10 work loward one day allending UCSD. 
Sludenis laking Teacher Educalion Program (TEP) 130, "Public Ser-

vice: Practicum in Learning," are assigned one or Iwo elementary school 
sludcnls to menlor, serving as a role model and friend 10 Ihem for alleasl 
40 hours throughoul the quarter. Menlors also allend a weekly leclltrc 
focusing on leaching melhods, lhe public school syslem and Ihe hislory 
of public service on America. TEP 130, a six-unil course, counts as a non-
conliguous, upper-division class for all five colleges. In addilion, il meels 

Ihe significant wriling, disciplinary 

Studenth erlences breadlh and public service requirements for Marshall college and may be taken as part of a TEP minor.

80th UCSD sludenls and elemenlary 
school sludenls wilh menlors report Ihatlbe P.A.L. program has enriched 
lheir lives. OUI of Ihe 214 sludenls surveyed by Ihe Course and Professor 
Evalualion (CAPE) service during Ihe 1996-97 and 1991-98 academic 
years, 99 percenl said they recommended TEP 130 and 98 percenl rec-
ommended lhe course inslruclor. In a recenl P.A.L. program evaluation, 
99 percenl of lhe elemenlary SludenlS wilh menlors Slaled Ihal Ihey 
enjoyed lhe experience, and 95 percenl of lhe elemenlary schoolsludenls 
slaled thaI lheir menlors had helped Ihem academically. 

The P.A.L. program is not only limiled 10 menloring elemenlary 
school stuclenls. As pan of lhe nalionwide America Reads Inilialive, slu-
denls enrolled in lhe two-unil TEP 132, "America Reads," help children 
in primary grades improve their reading and writing skills, America 
Reads tutors work with three 10 four primary-grade sludenls idenlified by 
their leacher as reading slighlly below grade level. 

During TEP 132 lectures, UCSD sludents learn aboul children's liler-
ature, child development and leaching. In addilion, work-study sludenls 
who tutor more than the required 40 hours can earn wages. According 10 
the PAL program evaluation, many of the children in lhe America Reads 
program move up to grade-level reading before the end of lhe school 
year. 

Due 10 the success of the other P.A.L. programs, TEP 136, "High 
School Tutoring," will be offered for the firSltime spring quarter. UCSD 
sludcnts will tulor high school sludents in English, Malh, Science and 
Hislory oneoOn-one and in small groups, while serving as a college role 
model for Ihem. Like TEP 130,lhe course is six units and fulfills Ihe non-
conliguous requirements for all colleges. II also meels Ihe significanl 
wriling, disciplinary breadth and public service requiremenls for Mar-
shall college and can be used loward a TEP minor. 

Sludenls inleresled in enrolling in TEP 
130, TEP 132 or TEP 136 should go 10 Ihe

Monday. March I. 1999 

WALT DICKINSON 
Editor in Chief 

A short while back. I wrote a 
story on the potential effects of the 
year 2000 rollover. II was intended 
to be a humorous appraisal of the 
extremely over-hyped Y2K com-
puter glitch. I wrote it thinking thai 
people couldn ' t possibly be so 
dependent on computers that a sim-
ple miscalculation could snowball 
into a serious catastrophe. I felt that 
humanity's ability for rational 
thinking and problem solving 
would make it possible for us to 
come to grips with such a kink and 
solve it before it got out of hand. 

II turns out I was wrong. 
II started last Monday, at 11 :06 

p.m. First let me say thatI'm a big 
e-mail junkie. Want to let me know 
something'! E-mail it. Someone 
call and leave a message'! E-mail 
me the message. Do lowe you 
money from the last time we ate 
out'! Don't tell me, I'll probably 
forget. E·mail me the bill. 

So I check my e-mail a lot. 
especially while I'm :u home,

The UCSD Guardian FEATURES II 

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 
Computer illiteracy continues to plague Revelle students 
account every few minutes and 
stans flashing icons in my menu 
bar whenever it finds anything . 
And I've never had any trouble 
with my mailbox being flooded 
with pointless messages. 

Well, that's not exactly true, 
Right after I arrived at UCSD, all of 
the people I had known in high 
school realized that they could keep 
in touch with everyone by sending 
these big. batch e-mails to us. Pret-
ty soon, the messages had dissolved 
into pointless observations about 
Ihe difference In the weather· 
between Davis and Dartmouth. 

I tinally had to beg them to stop 
writing - if I'd cared about the 
weather in Davis or Dartmouth (or 
keeping in such close contact with 
them) I wouldn't have moved to 
San Diego. Where, as we all know, 
the weather is lovely every day of 
the year even when it's raining like 
a tropical monsoon. 

But I digress. The issue at hand 
is my loss of respect for the aver-
age students' abilily 10 function 
logically when their computer sys-
tems are apparently malfunction-
ing. On the Monday in question, 
someone (it really doesn't mailer 
who or why) subscribed the rev-
elle-commuters@ucsd.edu e-mail 
address to a Yahoo account. 

I got this e-mail shortly afier it 
was distributed to everyone, read it, 
and threw it away. (That's an 
important point we just brushed

over, so we'll come back to it.) 
About an hour later, another stu-
dent got it, rcad it, and e·mailed 
revelle-commuters@ucsd.edu with 
a subject line which read: 

REMOVE. (This, I cannot stress 
any more emphatically, is very 
wrong.) 

Undoubtedly, most Revelle stu-
dents did what I did and threw the 
message away. However, in this 
case, the intelligence of the majori-
ty did nothing to lessen the outright 
stupidity of the minority. People 
continued to e-mail revelle-com-
mUlers@ucsd.edu with requests to 
be removed from Ihe mailing list 
unti I Friday. 

Some of Ihe people on the list 
lried 10 explain thai responding to 
the mass-mailing account didn't 
remove someone from the list but 
rather senl a copy of Ihe request to 
everyone else. Most of these mes-
sages must have been ignored as 
more junk mail by the fools who 
went right ahead and did it any-
way. 

I considered removing myself 
from the list the correct way, but it 
was too much fun to watch the peo-
ple who couldn't understand why 
they were being inundated with 
junk mail squinn. If you think thai 
makes me an e-mail sadist you may 
be right - but they had their 
chance to get out. Besides, if these 
Revelle students can't figure out 
how to remove themselves from a 
mailing list, maybe they don't 
deserve to have e-mail. 

As the week progressed, the 
messages became increasingly 
annoying and bitter. Those who 

couldn't understand why the mes-
sages weren't stopping became 
more frustrated, while those who 
understood that the system had bro-
ken down and that they could take 
advantage of it were having a field 
day. 

Ideas for parties were suggest-
ed, some people made insuhing 
remarks at other students for not 
realizing Ihat their removal mes-
sages were going to everyone, 
others criticized the people who 
were making the insults. I felt like 
I was witnessing a digital "Lord 
of the Flies" with a bunch of chil-
dren who couldn't agree on the 
rules. 

At last, there came a message 
that the accounl would shortly be 
moderated and the junk mail would 
stop. I breathed a sigh of relief. 

Finally, four days after one 
meaningless e-mail message was 
mass-mailed to the Revelle Com-
muters, the number of worthless, 
bullshit reply e-mails reached its 
peak at 168 total messages. It now 
seems as though the moderation of 
the account has been implement-
ed. 

I saved all 168 for the purposes 
of sharing with the teaming masses 
of Guaniian-reading students from 
every college on this campus that 
the danger isn't in the Y2K bug or 
any computer virus. Humanity is 
(and always has been) the ultimate 
danger to itself. 

Student&perience, 
Public service through the Teacher Education Program enriches the lives of students and teachers 
By JuIII u.. .... 
Senior St.ff Writer 

I think I have typed the phrtISC 
"under-represented racial minority 
group" at least 500 times sinl."C I 
staned working for the Guaniian 
two-and-a-half years ago. Until 
recently. however. I had no idea 
what it meant. 

To me, it was just a set of polit-
ically charged words. 

.But. my mentees - Gina and 
Shaniqua - have shown me that 
no simple phrase can ever fully 
describe what it's like to be full of 
potential but not expected to suc-
ceed academically. 

No phrase can ever show how 
unfair it is that these bright girls 
must use an encyclopedia from 

The Jake '5 On Yau 

1973 for their research projects, or 
that they must spend PE running on 
a din track covered with snails: 

And tinally, no phrase can ever 
clearly convey how much my 
mentees' classmates need their own 
mentors to sit at their desks and tell 
them that they belong at UCSD. 

Every time I am at Carver Ele-
mentary School, a child tells me 
about something that one of the 
other mentors has done recently. 
Whether it's by editing an essay or 
by beating the class athlete at telh-
email, the UCSD mentors are defi-
nitely making an impression on the 
kids at Carver. 

I remember sitting at a UC 
Regents meeting a long time ago, 
listening to a description of a new

outreach initiative. During the dis-
cussion, one of the regents men-
tioned that the goal of the Universi-
ty of California is threefold - to 
achieve excellence in teaching, 
research and public service. "Pub-
lic service?" I thoughl. "What does

that have to do with building a 
great university'! How does that 
affect me'!" 

Looking back, I realize how 
foolish I was. 

That the university aims to 
excel in public service indicates 
that it is committed to making Cal-
ifornia a better place to live, there-
by improving the quality of the 
University of California, as well. 
By promoting public service, the 
university is recognizing that every 
California taxpayer deserves to get 
something back for his or her con-
tribution. The university is also 
acknowledging the fact that a pub-
lic university should enrich the 
lives of everyone in the state, not 
just those who are lucky enough to 

attend its plush campuses. 
Public service has affected me 

in that it means I will graduate 
from UCSD as a more thoughtful, 
knowledgeable and well-rounded 
person. By mentoring, I have 
gained a much greater understand-
ing of both my potential and the 
potential of kids in general. 

Most importantly, I have 
learned to look beyond phrases like 
"under-represented racial minority 
group." Now, when I hear about 
outreach programs, my first reac-
tion is no longer 10 spit out a four-
word phrase, but to think of the 
benefits these programs will bring 
to my favorite Carver Elementary 
School students - Gina and Shani-
qua.

Student Involvement: Lovelace in the TEP 132 "America 
Reads " program at Laurel Elementary in Oceanside, CA. 

Student 
Experience 
Teacher Education Program draws out 
students and increases involvement 
By Lyndsey Lovelace 
Special to the Guardian 

The PAL program has been 
one of the best experiences I've 
had since coming to UCSD. My 
first experience with the program 
was as a mentor to two sisters -
a fifth and tirst grader through 
TEP 130. "My girls '," as I like to 
I:all them, went to Valencia Park 
Elementary. I used to visit them a 
couple times a week at school, 
then take them out on the week-
ends. It was great for me because 
I had a very difficult time when I 
first got here. The move to San 
Diego was difficult for me. and 
looking back, those girls really 
helped me to adjust to life here. 
They made me feel connected to 
the community in <J very unique 
way, and through their family, I 
made some great friends. 

After my great experience in 
TEP 130, I decided to try TEP 
132- the America Reads Chal-
lenge. I've loved TEP 132 so 
much, that I've taken the c1~s a 
total of 5 quarters!! Helping the 
kids learn how to read has been an 
amazing experience. I have learned 
so many things from the kids I've 
had the opportunity to work with 

- they have really taught me a lot 
about myself. I think by working 
with them, I've really become a 
better person - a lot more patient, 
thoughtful, loving, and silly ... 
detinitely a lot more silly! And 
with all the practice I've had, I'd 
like to think I'm becoming a better ' 
teacher and role model as well. 

During the summer of 1998, I 
wor~ed as a teacher at Summer-
bridge. I taught sixth-grade math 
and leader~hip. It was an amazing 
experience actually having my 
own classroom. Decorating the 
classroom, grading papers, teach-
ing classes, and coming up with 
lessons plans kept us insanely 
busy, but 1 don't think I've ever . 
had a summer tilled with more fun 
in my entire life! It was great. The 
fieldtrips we took 10 SDSU, 
UCSD, and the Wild Animal Park 
were a blast. Who never knew 
UCSD could be such a cool place! 

The most important thing the 
PAL program has done for me is 
made me feel as if I have a home 
here on campus and out in the 
community. I actually found a 
place I belong and people I enjoy 
being with constantly - even if 
they all are under the age of 12!

LINDA C. BLACK ' 
Tribune Media Seroices 

1be sun is in Pisces all week at 
a favorable aspect to Mars in Scor-
pio. Not only does this help our 
intuition come in loud and clear. 
but it also gives us the confidence 
to follow our hunches. Mercury's 
trusit into Aries on Tuesday sharp-
ens our wits and is another spur 
encouraging action. Planning is 
required or confusion will result on 
Monday and Tuesday, when the 
moon is in Virgo. Cooler head~ 
should prevail from Tuesday 
through Friday, while the moon is 
in Libra. They should. but they 
might not, unless they work togeth-
er. Emotions triumph over reason 
this weekend. with the moon in 
passionate Scorpio. 

AlliES 
March 21 - April 19 

You're forced to be perfect on 
Monday and Tuesday. Just do it, 
don't argue. By Wednesday, your 
mind will be sharper, but don't hun 
anyone with it. An argument on 
Tuesday can lead to a new way by 
Wednesday. Ask a friend to pitch in 
on Thursday. The competition 
keeps you inspired on Friday. 

The UCSD Guardian 

HOROSCOPES 
Invest in love over the weekend, 
with a commitment. 

TAURUS 
April 20 - May 20 

Build a SUlK:ture to prota:t some-
one or something you love during 
the first pm of this week. It'll be 
easier then. Around Wednesday, 
other people's demands start domi-
nating your day. You won't have 
much time off until Friday. A meet-
ing that night ends in separation, but 
the bond you've been wanting 
should develop over the weekend. 

GEMINI 
May 21 -./une 21 

There's a tug-of-war going on 
Monday and Tuesday. Stay on the 
sidelines. Don't get in the middle. 
Your team or committee should 
start communicating more after 
Tuesday, but watch out. They may 
launch with their pet peeves about 
each other. Controversy rages 
through Friday, but don't speak too 
freely. A thoughtless remark coUld 
cause jealousy or hun feelings, 
especially over the weekend. 

CANCER 
June 22 -Ju~v 22 

Study what you need to know 
on Monday and Tuesday, It'll be 
easier to remember then. On 
Wednesday, you'll start running 
into delays and difficulties, even if 
you're watching where you're 
going. Other people keep changing 
their minds, that's Why. Friday 
starts with promise and ends with a 
tough choice. Go toward love and 
your weekend should be mar-

velous. 

LEO 
./u~l' 23 - AUg. 22 

You could lose a windfall just as 
quickly as you gained it if you're 
not careful on Monday. YOU'll be 
luckier at keeping your resources 
Tuesday, but Wednesday is tricky 
again. Learn as fast as you can on 
Thursday and Friday, so when con-
ditions stabilize over the weekend 
you'll be where you want to stay. 

VIRGO 
Aug. 23 - Sept. 22 

You're forceful and dynamic on 
Monday and Tuesday. Check to 
make sure you're right, too, by lis-
tening carefully to your competi-
tion. Wednesday, count your 
money carefully before you divvy 
it up. Watch for the chance to make 
more on Thursday. Your best buy is 
travel-related on Friday. Don't 
bother to take work horne this 
weekend. A neighbor is most likely 
to talk you out of doing it anyway. 

LIBRA 
Sept. 23 - Oct. 22 

Keep the secrets that you hear 
on Monday and Tuesday. Add new 
developments that come to light 
Wednesday, and you'll know which 
way to go Thursday, It's good to be 
generous, but don't give the store 
away on Friday. An extra job could 
bring appreciated income over the 
weekend. 

SCORPIO 
Oct. 23 - Nov. 21 

Your crew should go along with 

narldl!, MlroL 4tL 8pIII

(B~.tl~9~f M9t. t9 
d. Itok 91 t~. III) 

whatever you suggest on Monday 
and Tuesday. You'll stm getting 
resistance on Wednesday from a 
person who deals with paperwork. 
Don't try to push that one around. 
YOU'll get nowhere. Same holds 
true Thursday 'and Friday. By Sat-
urday, you should be back in con-
trol and ready to go. With a few 
minor snags, you'll power through 
to victory. 

SAGITTARIUS 
Nov. 22 - Dec. 21 

Confusion reigns on Monday 
and Tuesday. Those are your best 
days to propose a new idea. Your 
friends are on your side, especially 
Wednesday through Friday, so rely 
on their suppon. Get rid of old stuff 
over the weekend. You'll be in the 
mood to toss things out. 

CAPRICORN 
Dec. 22 -./an. 19 

Your practical common sense 
saves the day on Monday. Lead 
others through tbe confusion Tues-
day by keeping the goal in mind, 
The action is even more intense 
from Wednesday through Friday. A 
cautious friend helps you make 
good choices. Relax with friends 
over the weekend. Let somebody 
else set the agenda. 

AQUARIUS 
Jan. 20 - Feb. 18 

Don't gamble on Monday or 
Tuesday, not even with other peo-
ple's money. On Wednesday, 
you're a little luckier, but it's with 
relationships. Even then, you might 
learn by almost losing something. 

FEATIJRES 13 

Listen and learn on Thursday and 
Friday, even if you think you 
already know it all, and you'll do 
much better on the pop quiz that 
will happen on the weekend. Just 
answer the tough question honestly 
and you should do fine. 

PISCES 
Feb. 19 - March 20 

An adversarial relationship 
could develop between you and a 
neat freak the first pm of this 
week. Don't try to argue with one 
who's always right. Just accept the 
coaching. It's cheaper. Speaking of 
money, stash away as much as pos-
sible Thursday and Friday, so 
you'll have enough for a jaunt over 
the weekend. The opponunity will 
show up, so if you've got the cash, 
you're all set. 

BIRTHDAYS 
March 1 - March 7 

If you're having a birthday this 
week ... Born March I: Focus on 
keeping your partner happy this 
year, and your whole life will work. 
March 2: Another can provide just 
what you need this year, and it 
might be supponive coaching. 
March 3: Pooling resources with a 
partner brings security this year. 
March 4: Learn to budget this year 
and grow rich! March 5: You can 
make your future secure this year 
by devising a financial plan and 
sticking to it. March 6: You've 
been cooped up long enough! 
Make your break for distant shores 
this year. March 7: Expand your 
horizons this year by heeding the 
call ofthe wild.

PSYCHO THERAPY 
"Most Eligible Bachelor/Bachelorette" entry deadline extended 

MARY HIGGINS 
Senior Staff Writer 

Let me tell you, the men are run-
ning a tight race, but so far no 
women have been nominated at all 
- the field is wide open in the 
"Bachelorette" category! For this 
reason. I've extended the deadline 
to noon on Tuesday, March 2. 

Ladies. stop being so modest 
and take the initiative to nominate 
yourself! If you enter today, it's 
practically a sure thing! Just hustle 
on over to the nearest computer and 
type me up a few paragraphs about 
why you think you deserve to be 

No, the other panelists and I are 
merely looking for some OUlStand-
ing qualities thai make an individ-
ual really wor1hy of winning this 
esteemed award. Do you think 
you've got what it lakes to be the 
most famous bachelor or bache-
lorette at UCSO" Just follow this 
easy-to-use checklist and add up 
your "Desirability Points." 

Have you ever rescued small 
children from a burning building? 

Have you ever thrown yourself 
in front of a moving vehicle to save 

have a major social disorder? 
Would you sit Ihrough both 

reels of'7he Sound of Music" if il 
was your friend's favorite movie? 

Are you ready to catapult your-
self from sin,lehood and anonymi-
ty to a life of fame and fortune? 

If you've answered "yes" to one 
or more of these queslions, nomi-
nate yourself immediately for 
"Most Eli,ible BachelorlBache-
lorette." (However, if you 
answered "no" 10 the personal 
hygiene question, I'm sorry, that's 

Wow, did you guys catch that 
full-page spread for "Psycho Thera-
py" last week'! In Guardian tenns. 
that's the.equivalent of being a Play-
hoy centerfold! I think this is a per-
fect opportunity for me to thank my 
editor Jessica Scheppmann and 
GUlJrdian designer Nick Runco for 
working so hard to make me look 
good. I also want to thank that crclZY 
computer graphics guy John Barber 
for drawing an icon that looks like 
me. but is way more allractive. 

Do you respect the Basic Laws of Personal Hygiene 
(i.e. bathing regularly, wearing clean socks, not 

picking your nose during lecture)? 

OK. this isn't the Oscars. where 
people thank everything under the 
stars lor their immense success -
"And I'd like to thank the air that I 
breathe lor keeping me alive ... "-
so I'll just cut to the chase. The rea-
son I brought this up is because I 
believe that last week's hot layout 
had something to do with the land-
slide of nominations I have 
received for the "Most Eligible 
BachelorlBachelorelle" contest. 

By the way, there is still time to 
enter the race for a chance to win a 
free lunch at the Pub lor yourself or 
a friend (estimated value. $3 .25).

sparked a luming point for me. Not

UCSD Brings in 3 Wins 
SWEEP: O'Brien's squad won all three of its Cal State HaY'\:ard games

Real men know how to win big 
and slug it out with their oPPO-
n.:nls. 

R.:al men have the fundameO'-
lals of the game down solidly. 

Real men wear Triton blue and 
yellow. 

No. we ' re not talking about a 
football team here, but rather the 
UCSO baseball team and their 
victorious weekend against the 
Ca l State Hayward Pioneers. The 
Tritons swept CSU-Hayward in a 
three game series over the week-
end by decisive scores of 12-7 on 
Sunday, 13-4 on Saturday. and 5-1 
on Friday, improving to 9-5 on the 

~eason. UCSD innicted serious 
damage hy scoring 25 runs 

Jilt DonoIrio/GuatlIIan 
~ MIl: The Tritons shell-shocked the ailing Cal 5tae Hayward 
Pioneers all weekend long, taking them for three wins. 

on almost exactly as many 
hits - 26 in two 

Sanders entered the game for 
some relief work and got Zack 

Brown to ground into an 
inning-ending double-
play. The freshman . 

reliever faced 10 
I bailers through 3 and 

two thirds of an 
inning of c;onsistent 

gamo:s. Besides the 
Tritons offensive .... ALL 
prowess. UCSO's 
relief pitching and hus-
tle were key to the week-
end's win~ . 

The Tritons got oIl' the right foot 
on Saturday beginning in the bot-
tom of the 3rd when Steve Pelletier 
doubled to right center scoring Eric 
Thorpe. the fourth Triton score of 
the inning. Eddie Ishak. who started 
on the mound for the Tritons. was 
hving dangerously by hanging 
some slower pitches over the plale. 
but the Pioneers failed to swing 
aggressively. 

In the top of the 4th however. 
Hayward bats healed up wilh Ihree 
runs off four hits. The fourth hit 
was the last the Pioneers saw in 
the way of scoring after James

really made a big difference was

meet. We JII took it upon our-

pitching in which 
Hayward never made much 

solid contact at the plate. 
In the bOllom of the sixth 

inning. with the Tritons ahead 6-
4, Brian Terrell came up after 
Pelletier and Hill had reached base 
and smashed a 3-run homer to 
right. his third of the season. 

After that, it was all over, but 
UCSD kept pounding away with 
three in the bollom of the eighth. 
Terrell came in again in the top of 
the 91h 10 relieve and concluded 
Ihe walloping festival of 
Hayward, 13-4. Kenny Fluharty 
went 3 for, S with two RBI's and 
two runs, and Terrell with a 3 for 

selves to cncourage each other 
along the way." 

Another great performance on 
the day was that of freshman Phong 
Long. Long earned his team a vic-
tory in the long jump with a 
impressive jump or 2I',S". Long 
then went on to place second in the 
triple jump with a jump of 41'

"Everyone did really well out

said. "What really helped the team

Sunday's game was not any eas-

two runs in the bottom of the 1st, 
bul the big inning came in the Sth

for us with a really strong show-

The throwing team was led by 
the performance of senior co-cap-
tain Mall Seefeld. Seefeld eamed 
his team a victory in the hammer 
throw with a mark of SO.24 meters. 
He also earned points for his 42.8 
meter throw in the discus, good 
enough for second. and his 13.91

placed him third.

UCSD ··Falls to 'CMC 
HEARTBREAK: Steidlmayer's squad loses 3-4 
By •• ....., 
Senior Staff Motiter 

The world of sports is often 
described as an emotional roller 
coaster with many ups and downs. 
The Triton men's tennis team 
experienced one of the 
downs on Saturday 
when it lost to 
Claremont College 
by a heartbreaking 
score of 3-4. 

In singles, UCSD al)d 
Claremont split the six matches. At 
number one, All-American Steve 
Shabel dominated his opponent on 
route to a straight set win, 6-0, 6- I. 

At No. 2 singles, Joe Zerboni 
had a tough match as he got down 
early in the first set and lost that set 
1-6. The second set was much 
closer, but again Zerboni was 
unable to pull. it out and eventually 
lost 4-6. 

At No. 3 singles, Ping Yeh 
played Kim Sparrow, who is wide-
ly considered to be Claremont's 
best player. Like urboni, Yeh was 
blown out in the first set, 1-6, and 
then played tougher in the second 
set before falling 4-6 to lose the 
match. 

Mike Rosell was the Tritons' 
other bright spot as he won easily 
at No.4 singles, 6-1, 6-3. Rosett 
has been impressive all year and 
continues to improve both his sin-
gles and doubles play. 

"Mike RoSCII played some great 
doubles and some really solid sin-
gles," Head Coach Eric 
Steidlmayer said. "He definitely 
had the best performance on 
Saturday." 

At No. S singles Jason Hipp 

javelin. Dan Paredes came in first 
with a throw of 50.24 meters. with 
teammates Freeman and Malt 
Meskimen coming in second and 
third with a throw of 47.51 and 
46.72. respectively. 

Not to be outdone. the women's 
throwers were led by senior Christi 
Nonon, Who. won in both the ham-
mer throw, with a throw of 43.50 
meters. and the discus, with a mark 
of 40.96 meters. 

Also having a big day was 
freshman Lynne Brinkman, who 
placed second in the javelin with a 

dominated his opponent from 
beginning to end a.~ he cruised to a 
6-2,6-0 victory. 

No. 6 singles match between 
UCSO's Graeme Boushey and 

Claremont's Garett Lee was 
the closest singles 

matchup of the after-
noon. Boushey lost 
badly in the first set 
1-6, but fought back 

and won the second set, 
6·3. Unfonunately for the 

Tritons, the deciding third set 
went to Claremont, 2-6. 

All three doubles matches are 
only wonh one point combined, 
and on Saturday that doubles point 
became the deciding factor of the 
match. The Tritons could only 
manage to win one of the three 
doubles prosets, and therefore lost 
the doubles point and their founh 
match of the season. 

Zerboni and Shabel were locked 
in a close ballie at No. I doubles. 
The proset was locked at seven but 
Zerboni and Shabel then lost the 
next two games to lose 9-7. 

At No. 2 doubles, Brian Crain 
and Boushey lost a close one to 
Mall Sizemore and Jason Yardi 
from Claremont by the score of 8-4. 

No. 3 doubles featured Kai 
Miller and Mike Rosell for the 
Tritons against Kris Burrell and 
Brell Sheperdson from Claremont. 
Miller and Rosell were impressive 
and never in danger of losing the 
match as they cruised to an 8-3 vic· 
tory. 

"We played very spolly." 
Steidlmayer said. "This team is 
well within our reach but they were 
just beller than us." 

throw of 34.38 meters. 
The throwing team's successful 

day was rounded out with the per-
formance of freshman Megan 
Steel, who placed second in the 
shot put with a throw of 38'1.5". 

The Tritons will next travel to 
Irvine to participate in the UC 
Championships this weekend. 

"It should an interesting meet 
[next weekend]," Rodriguez said. 
'There should be a lot of Division 
I and II schools to compete 
against. It should be a good com-
petition."

Anteaters Are No Problem Furious Fencing 
DOIIINAIION: UCSD crew motors by UC Irvine in five of six races TOUCHES: Lee's squad takes care of Cal Tech 
ByJolln...,... 
Sports Editor 

The armed forces claim they do 
more before sunrise than most pe0-
ple do in a single day. When mak· 
ing this claim, they seemed to over-
look UCSO's crew team. 

Six days a week, every week of 
the school year, the Tritons are out . 
of bed before 4 a.m. and in Mission 
Bay before 5 a.m. for a couple 
hours of grueling work. Then they 
have class, then an afternoon work-
out, then they study, then they 
sleep. And then they wake up and 
do it all over again. 

This hard work is beginning to 
payoff for UCSD crew. On 
Saturday, the Tritons went head-to-
head with the UC Irvine Anteaters 
in the Newpon Harbor and came 

. home with few, if any, disappoint-
ments. UCSO was victorious in 4 
of its 6 races, as it beat Irvine hand-
ily. 

The men won all three of their 
races, while the women won two of 
their three races. 

Junior Paul Dodge, a member of 
the men's varsity eight, said that 
the team was pleased with its per-
fonnance overall. 

"We expected to do well and we 
prepared very hard for it," Dodge 
said. ''The race was closer than we 
expected it to be." 

The closest of the men's three 
races was the varsity eight race. 
The Tritons held only a boat-length 
lead over the Anteaters for the 
majority of the 2.000-meter race. 
But toward the end of the race.

But when the day is done, 
before going on for the post-round 
interview, you need to collect your-
self. Above all, don't say during an 
interview on national television 
that you were "pissed off" with 

Irvine began to close in on the 
small lead. giving the Tritons a 
scare. The varsity eight was 
undaunc.cd. however, and came in 
with a winning time of 6: 11 .7. 

The men's novice squad posted 
results as solid as its varsity coun-
terparts against the Anteaters. The 
novice boats won each of their two 
races convincingly. 

In the men's novice eight. the 
earlier of their two races, the rook-
ies breezed by Irvine with a win-
ning time of 6:35. Irvine came in 
with a slumbering time of 7:06.3. 

Dodge said that he was blown 
away with the novice eight's race. 

''The novice eight, my god. they 
just smashed Irvine," he said. 
''They beaI them by a good eight 
boat lengths. That's really good." 

Rookie rower Steve CambaJik 
was also pleased with his team's 
race. 

"For our first race it was 
intense," Cambalik said. "I was 
nervous, but all of those four-in-
the-mornings paid off." 

If the Tritons were nervous for 
their first races, those jitters surely 
wore off by their second race. In 
the novice four, the men destroyed 
both Irvine boats by 26 and 54 sec-
onds, respectively. The Tritons' 
winning time was 7:37. 

The women's team put in a solid 
day as well. Both the novice four 
and the novice eight came "'rough 
with wins, while the varsity eight 
finished a mere 12 seconds off the 
pace. 

The novice eight won its 2000-

your score. The reponer was kind 
enough to suggest saying "upset." 
but you embarrassed yourself and 
the tour with your comments. 

Tiger has become so popular 
that he's in the headlines no mailer 
what he shoots. When he wins, it's 
Tiger on the front page; when he 
finishes in 15th place his name is in 
the headline; even when he fails to 
make the cut his name in the head-
line.

meter race by over 16 seconds, as it 
carne in with a winning time of 
7:40.3. 

Later on. the varsity four took 
care of Irvine with a winning time 
of 8:39.3 in its race. 

Though the Tritons left Newport 
with some convincing wins, Dodge 
said that they still have some work 
to do. 

"We want to get 20 seconds 
faster," Dodge said. "Last year we 
won the Pacific Coast Rowing 
Championships and barely lost the 
Crew Classic by one· tenth of a sec-
ond." 

But before the Tritons go for 
gold in the Crew Classic and in the 
Pacific Coast Rowing 
Championships, they will focus on 
this weekend's dual competition 
with Long Beach State, which, 
according to Dodge, promises to be 
a much tougher battle. 

"Long Beach will definitely be 
more of a challenge," Dodge said. 
"We took them by surprise and beat 
them handily last year, but they're 
ready this year, so we've got to 
work even harder." 

The Long Beach row will signi-
fy the end of winter quaner for the 
Tritons, but not the end of their 
workouts. They have "Spring 
Row" to look forward to over 
Spring Break, where they will have 
workouts three times a day. These 
workouts serve as the training for 
the Tritons first big event of the 
season - the San Oiego Crew 
Classic held March 27 and March 
28. 

Fans come with this kind of 
notoriety, and Tiger's are rowdy. 
After every shot, I hear "YOU DA 
MAN, TIGER!" no matter what he 
does. Tiger makes a putt, "YOU 
OA MAN, TIGER!" Tiger hits a 
sand trap, "YOU DA MAN, 
TIGER!" These distractions can be 
heard all over the course, and it 
gives an unfair disadvantage when 
the OIher players, who may be in 
the middle of their backswing, hear

The UCSD fencing team sur-
passed Lee's expectations on Feb. 
20, when it traveled to Pasadena 
for a tri·meet against Cal 
State Fullerton and Cal 
Tech. Though the 
Tritons fell to 
Fullerton, 
they came 
through 
against Cal Tech, 
winning every division except for 
men's saber. 

"Overall we performed the 
way we wanted to, if not beller," 
Women's Foil Captain Amy 
Weinstein said. "We were pretty 
enthused after the Santa Barbara 
competition [Feb. 6], and were 
ready for Cal Tech." 

The Cal Tech meet marked the 
Tritons' final competition before 
the West Regional 
Championships, and they seem to 
be in good standing. 

Overall, the women's epee 
team went undefeated on the sea-
son, sweeping the conference. 
Three of the four varsity starters 
finished in the top five of the con-
ference. 

Junior Julia Kulla-Mader is 
one of these starters. Kulla-Mader 
put together another outstanding 
season this year. She finished sec-
ond in conference overall. The 
title slipped out of her hands this 
weekend as she lost her match to 
Cal Tech, 4-5 and missed out on 
placing 1st in the conference for 

screams and whoopings. 
These fans may have good 

intentions, but they are promoting a 
"Happy Gilmore" atmosphere that 
is undesirable in golf. 

I do not blame Tiger for anything 
but his own immaturity. And in his 
defense, he is improving his course 
etiquette. He is simply a young 
golfer trying to make a living doing 
what he does best. I blame the 
media. Nike and the fans that cannot 

the year by I point. Nonetheless, 
Kulla-Mader will be a contender 
for the NCAA Nationals. 

Junior Tedd Padgill will be 
another contender for UCSO in the 

NCAA Nationals. 
Padgitt went undefeated 

in saber 
competi-
tion for the 

season, but did 
not compete in every 

event. The junior missed 
one event. This lack of 

attendance, however, cost Padgitt a 
conference title. But his consisten-
cy in the competitions he entered 
enabled him to finish 6th in the 
conference and it also earned him a 
bid into the postseason. 

Padgill's saber teammate, 
Peter Graham, capped off his 
final year of eligibility finishing 
2nd in conference 

Besides the likes of Padgill • 
Graham and Kulla-Mader, UCSO 
boasted some other stellar fencers 
as well. Freshman Laura Muir 
placed founh in the conference in 
women's epee - only 4 touches 
shy of third place. Freshman 
Steve Silva was also outstanding. 
Silva finished second overall in 
men's epee with a 26-4 record on 
the season. 

First-year foilist Justin Hunt, 
who performed as the rookie of 
the year according to Lee, capped 
off his inaugural season with a 
most impressive win. Hunt beat 
Ariel Reyes, the conference's best 
foilist, 5-3 in the Pasadena meet. 

behave in a respectful manner when 
watching a game that requires 
absolute concentration and skill. 

These people all need to settle 
down and let Tiger Woods play the 
game. After all, I am not Tiger 
Woods and you are not Tiger 
Woods. Let Tiger Woods be Tiger 
Woods and leave him alone. 

And Tiger Woods, for not yet 
taking a 3-wood to the windshield 
of a reporter's car, I salute you .

Track Wins Yet Another One 
GOOD TIMES: UCSD track and field kept the groove going this weekend 
By Saul SherIdan 
Senior Staff Writer 

The pieces are coming logether. 
The talent is cenainly there, the 
dedication is there and, most 
imponantly, Ihe team unity is 
really showing. The UCSD 
track and field team has
