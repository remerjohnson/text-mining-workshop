Family and friends of UCSD 
L i n g u i s t i c s 
lecturer Henry 
Acejo � who 
was killed in 
Tijuana on 
Dec. 18, are 
d isappointed 
from the lack 
of response 
from the UCSD 
community.

Acejo passed 
away in his 

Tijuana home, where he was found 

with multiple stab wounds. Mexican 
authorities said he died shortly after 
11 p.m. 

The tragic death of former UCSD 
Filipino Heritage Language instructor 
Henry Acejo has received numerous 
national and international news 
coverage, alumnus and friend Ernald 
Macaraeg wrote in an e-mail. Yet, the 
UCSD administration and linguistics 
department has not issued any form of 
official statement, mass student body 
e-mail or sent a message of condolence 
to the Acejo family and friends.

According to UCSD spokesperson 
Christine Clark, it is not university 
protocol to release a public statement 
regarding faculty deaths. Statements 

regarding loss of members of the UCSD 
community are normally reserved for 
chancellors or other administrative 
faculty who have passed.

Although few details have been 
released regarding possible suspects in 
the case, investigators suspect that two 
men seen with Acejo hours before his 
body was discovered  could have a 
connection to his murder. �

The investigators also said Acejos 
sister had sent him $1,500 to come 
to the Philippines for Christmas. 
Speculation has been raised about 
whether this money could have been 
the reason for his murder. His autopsy

At a time when the UC system is in the red, the 13-percent growth in the number of UCSDs Fall 2011 applicants rep-resents both aid and a headache. Though tuition for both in- and out-of-state students has increased, it is only a drop 
in the bucket in the face of the $500-million budget cut. 

Throughout the entire UC system, 142,235 prospective students 
applied to at least one of the 10 UC campuses. This is a 6.2 percent 
increase from last years record-breaking 134,029 applicants. 

According to data released on Jan. 14, undergraduate applications for 
Fall 2011 increased for the seventh straight year. All campuses had record 
numbers in applications, with UCSD having the highest increase at 11.2 
percent. UC Merced and Riverside followed with 8.9 and 8.5 percent, 
respectively.

There were 106,070 freshmen applicants  an increase of 5.7 percent 
from 100,320  while transfer students made up the other 36,165, or 7.3 
percent more than last years 33,709. 

All UC campuses saw growth in transfer applications, according to 
a UC statement, which have increased system-wide by 26 percent since 
2009.

Southern California applicants make up 28 percent, while 25 percent 
are from the San Francisco Bay Area. Thirty percent of freshman 
applicants call Los Angeles their home. 

Among nonresident students, there were increases of 10.7 percent from 
out-of-state and 22.5 percent from international freshman applicants. 

The number of freshman applications from California residents 
increased by 3.6 percent, UC Admissions Director Susan Wilbur said in

New Solar Panel Technology May Boost Efficiency
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Jonathan Kaslow
Contributing Writer

Renewable energy sources 
— specifically solar panels — have 
become increasingly popular in the 
United States. And now, in light of their 
popularity, researchers’ new methods 
and data can predict how to generate 
the most power from sun energy.

Using solar panels (known as solar 
photovoltaic, or PV, systems), sunlight 
can be used to create energy. Placement 
of the panels greatly determines how 
much of this energy can be obtained.

Environmental engineering 
professor Jan Kleissl and a team of 
graduate students are working to 
increase the efficiency of solar panels. 
To do this, they are using public 
satellite data to determine at which 
orientation solar panels can operate 
at maximum efficiency. This can be 
found by tracking the data of angles, 
positioning and the solar panel’s level of 
rotation for a year. Kleissl and his team 
also monitor how much extra energy a 
tracking solar panel can receive versus 

a fixed panel.
“We take publicly available satellite 

data of sunshine (solar irradiance) 
and simulate how much solar energy 
systems at different orientations would 
be able to produce over the year,” 
Kleissl said. “The optimum orientation 
consisting of an azimuth and a tilt angle 
is found and displayed on a map.”

The map, which is publicly available 
on Google Earth, predicts the energy 
output of the solar panels. The goal is to 
make solar panels “see” the sun as long 
as possible, maximizing energy output. 
As efficiency and output increases, the 
price of solar power decreases, making it 
a better alternative to fossil fuels.

Kleissl published a paper in 
Renewable Energy that summarized 
his research on ray-tracking 
technologies, using data gathered 
from May to October 2010. The paper 
said solar panels must be installed at 
optimal angles toward the sun to obtain 
maximum energy.

The research team are working with 
the California Energy Commission, 
the Department of Energy and the 

California Public Utility Commission.
“[The purpose is to] lower costs, 

provide expertise and facilitate grid-
integration of solar power in California 
and the nation,” Kleissl said.

Kleissl hopes that in providing 
this information, solar panels will 
be installed where they will be most 
effective.

The methods for optimizing solar 
panels are not new, but Kleissl’s work 
is the first to apply it to the entire 
country, not just a single site.   Using 
this research, firms can  increase the 
amount of energy they receive from 
panels, which may be very valuable in 
coastal areas such as San Diego and 
Los Angeles.   The result would lessen 
reliance on other forms of energy, 
especially during peak hours of energy 
consumption.

Moving forward, Kleissl will start 
looking more into the economic side 
of the issue.

“We will refine results 
geographically by examining shading,” 
Kleissl said. “We will take into account 
electricity tariffs to optimize economics 

of solar power.” 
Until now, one of the complaints 

about solar energy is its high cost. 
Kleissl hopes to make solar panels a 
more attractive alternative as the 
country continue to shift their sources 
of energy production.

Kleissl realizes that the solar power 
technology is far from saturated, and he 
is eager to begin more projects. 

“There are many challenges and fun 
projects in solar power,” Kleissl said.

LIGHTS AND SIRENS

results have not been released.
One of 12 children, Acejo lived in 

Zona del Rio, Tijuana, and sent more 
than $1,000 a month to his family in 
the Philippines.

The educator taught at three San 
Diego area colleges. He was a Filipino 
Heritage Program lecturer at UCSD 
from 2006 to 2008, teaching Filipino 
Communication and Culture for 
beginners and advanced learners.

Acejo was a linguistics professor 
at SDSU, where he founded the first 
Filipino Program in 2004. He also 
taught ESL classes at Southwestern and 
Mid-City College.

Atilio V. Alicio — a fellow UCSD 
Heritage Program instructor who 
worked closely with Acejo —  has been 
in contact with Acejo’s family in the 
Philippines and Hong Kong, and has 
expressed frustration with the lack of 
response from the UCSD community. 

All the universities Acejo taught at 
— except UCSD — have held memorial 

services in response to his death. 
Twelve days after his death, SDSU’s 

Department of Linguistics and Asian/ 
Middle Eastern Languages released a 
statement mourning Acejo’s passing.

“Acejo’s death is an immense loss to 
the department ... and to the university,” 
Arabic Professor Ghada Osman said 
in the statement. “He was a very 
popular instructor whose creativity, 
knowledge, hard work and dedication 
to his students as a professional were 
deeply striking. His upbeat personality, 
ubiquitous smile, sense of humor 
and care for others as a person were 
extraordinary.”

Southwestern students also set up 
a Facebook page called “Celebrating 
the Life of Professor Henry Acejo.” 
Students also set up a fund to aid in 
funeral expenses for the family. Mid-
City College is thinking about starting 
a scholarship under his name.

According to Alicio, the family is 
still awaiting a personal response from 
UCSD to express condolences. 

“[He was a] kid brother, colleague 
and a friend,” Alicio, who spoke at his 
memorial service on Dec. 28 at Mid-
City College, said. “Just having Henry 
around made you feel better, whatever 
the challenge, and we all got to know 
his positive disposition and ever-ready 
words of encouragement. The UCSD 
community lost a great educator.”

Acejo fought to keep the Heritage 
Program alive at UCSD, encouraging 
students to join and play an active role 
in the community. He believed in the 
importance of the Filipino legacy and 
inspired his students to feel the same.

“Henry was approachable and 
personal, often taking students out 
to participate in his favorite pastime, 
karaoke,” Macaraeg said. 

A viewing was held for family 
and friends on Dec. 28. Acejo was 
laid to rest in San Mateo, Rizal in the 
Philippines on Jan. 16.

a statement. “Since we are in a period 
where the number of projected high 
school graduates is flat, this increase 
suggests more students are meeting the 
university’s admissions requirements.”

This is the last year that the current 
UC admissions guidelines will be used. 
Effective 2012, minimum requirements 
no longer include two SAT-II subject 
tests. The new guidelines broaden the 
guaranteed admissions based on high 
school rank. Applicants must now be 
within the top 9 percent rather than the 
top 4 percent. However, fewer students 
— 10 percent compared to 12 percent 
— will be guaranteed admission. 

UCSD received 70,474 applicants 
this year, up from last year’s 62,376, 
making it the UC campus with the 
second-highest number of applications. 

UCLA took the top spot with 81,235 
applicants, a 6.4-percent increase from 
last year’s 76,313.

“We are pleased to receive a record 
number of applications from impressive 
students with outstanding academic 
qualities,” Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Admissions Mae Brown said. “Our 
outreach efforts have continued to 
attract more talented first-generation 
and underrepresented students.”

UCSD’s freshman applicants 
increase from 48,069 to 53,455 — 
an 11.2-percent increase. Transfer 
applicants rose by 19 percent to 14,307.

The ethnic make-up of UCSD 
applicants changed as well. The biggest 
growth occurred in the Chicano/
Latino pool, which increased by 34.4 
percent from 9,655 to 12,978. African 
American applicants rose 11.8 percent 

from 2,210 to 2,471. American Indian 
applicants fell 1.2 percent, from 397 
to 392.

Despite continued growth in 
applicant numbers, Brown said 
campuses may experience a reduction 
in enrollment.

“The state is currently not providing 
funding for approximately 11,000 of 
our University of California students,” 
Brown said. “This situation cannot be 
sustained without seriously damaging 
the quality of education our students 
expect and deserve. Therefore, all of 
our campuses have no choice but to 
reduce the enrollment of California 
residents, in order to bring enrollment 
closer into line with funding.”

SHOULD UCSD RELEASE A 
STATEMENT ON HENRY ACEJO?

VOTE ONLINE.

√  Yes
√  No
√  I don’t know

Despite the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act’s goal to halt meth production, six years later, the bill has spurred an underground black mar-
ket for cough syrup. 

Now that the law prohibits those with a record from buying cough syrup, 
many methamphetamine producers have called upon others with clean records 

to buy it for them. 
According to Associated Press reporter Jim Salter, the 

electronic tracking system has not halted the drug market, 
but instead has opened a dangerous door for individuals 
with seemingly clean records to profit from the sale of 
cough medicine to those working in meth labs. 

The electronic systems mandated by the law are used 
to track the sales of cold medicine and allow pharma-
cies to instantly check whether the customer has already 
purchased the legal limit of pseudoephedrine (3.6 grams 
daily). But the illegal market for the product has expanded 
to the point that those cleared to purchase cough syrup are 
able to re-sell it at up to five times the price, with a very 
low risk for being discovered and arrested. 

According to Gary Boggs, an agent at the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, this law has created a “sub-

criminal culture” that allows those with a clean record to weekly pharmacy 
rotations buying cough medicine until they have reached the legal limit. 

Although lawmakers had good intentions in trying to deter the drug fiends, 
the bill has actually increased illegal activity. If that’s not evidence of the mea-
sure’s failure, we don’t know what is.

QUICKTAKES  Failed Cough Syrup Legislation 

A new black market has emerged for cold medicines containing pseudoephed-rine, which, in addition to soothing your throat, is used to make meth. 
The five-year-old phenomenon reveals that current state laws mandating 

electronic monitoring systems to track purchases of over-the-counter cold pills 
have failed to curb the drug trade — but in the absence of funding to develop 
more sophisticated monitoring technology, the legislature’s 
2005 ban was the best solution in the war on methamphet-
amine. 

The 2005 Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act 
mandates that cold pills be placed behind the counter, that 
purchasers show ID and that pharmacies log each sale. 
With electronic tracking, buyers’ names are entered into 
statewide databases, and customers are forbidden from 
purchasing more than their monthly limit of cold medi-
cines containing the substance.

The law hasn’t put a huge dent in illegal meth usage 
— there were approximately 12 million users in 2005 and 
13 million in 2007 — though methamphetamine-related 
arrests and drug seizures did rise by 34 percent.

According to Missouri Pharmacy Association CEO 
Ron Fitzwater, without electronic tracking, law enforcers 
would have less help tracking down dealers. Methamphetamine production 
would remain unchanged and producers wouldn’t have to resort to under-the-
table deals to acquire pseudoephedrine.

As long as the enormous profitability of the drug trade is around to seduce 
narcotics producers, all that can be done is to hinder the process by limiting 
where producers can get their product and plug away with new technology.

Law Opens Door to Illegal Black Market

In a futile effort at turning back the clock, the new Republican majority in the House of 
Representatives will attempt to repeal 
health care reform (aka Obamacare) 
on Jan. 12, challenging the forces of 
other Democrats in Washington and 
potentially leaving its own party on 
the rocks. 

Although the average American 
will hardly feel the benefits from this 
health care reform bill, President 
Obama will undoubtedly veto any-
thing that resembles a repeal. And the 
Senate is still under the reins of the 
Democrats — the ones who passed 
the legislation in the first place. Unless 
an enormous number of Democrats 
cross the aisle to undo the reform they 
voted for, there’s little chance of the 
Republicans getting the two-thirds 
needed to override a presidential veto. 

Politically, though, this vote will 
help filter out Democrats standing 
against Obama, and their districts will 
be ripe for Republican taking. And 
if Obama continues to lose good will 
among Democrats, that will bode well 
for Palin — I mean, whoever appears 
on the GOP ticket — next year. 

On the other hand, the repeal 
bill isn’t even paired with Republican 
reform. Repealing the bill only further 
stigmatizes Republicans as the “Party 
of No.” Trying to pass a bill that satis-
fies die-hard Tea Partiers, who will 
stop at nothing until Obama is impris-
oned (preferably in Guantanamo 
Bay), is a poor move to reach out to 
moderates in the upcoming election. 
To increase its electability for 2012, 
the GOP needs to move forward and 
— dare I say it — progress. 

Interestingly enough, the 
Congressional Budget Office recently 
released a report indicating that a 
repeal would actually increase the 
deficit by about another $230 billion, 
as the bill cuts Medicare and raises 
some payroll taxes. This puts the GOP 
at odds with its promises of reducing 
the burgeoning deficit, yet it intends 
to continue pressing on, ignoring the 
CBO analysis. 

Republicans can still defund 
certain parts of the bill, like further 
Medicaid expansion, without wholly 
repealing legislation. There’s plenty 
to dislike about a bill that makes the 
bank bailout bill look like a Christmas 
present (Yeah, I said ‘Christmas,’ not 
‘the holidays,’ get over it).

Twenty-four physician-owned 
hospitals halted construction because 
the bill favored community hospi-
tals, which the American Hospital 
Association successfully lobbied for. 
Reform should start with telling lob-
byists to take a hike, and then work 
toward a solution favorable to all — 
not just certain industries. 

Medical costs are one of the driving 
factors of the deficit, and Republicans 
should make sure our health care sys-
tem remains competitive, but still pro-
tects the poorest members of society. 
So, the budget shouldn’t be balanced 
by cutting Medicaid. 

Last year’s health care reform was 
only a small step toward fixing our 
medical woes. Republicans now have 
a responsibility to refine Obamacare 
so a fair and lasting solution can 
emerge.

In two weeks, you will be crowding at the on-campus box office to buy tickets to A.S. Council’s Winter Triton Festival, then 
eagerly cramming yourself into Price Center West 
Ballroom to watch headlining comedians Donald 
Glover and Kat Phan. 

Or so A.S. Council hopes. And if the Concerts 
and Events office manages to promote the event 
and coordinate all its moving parts, this might 
just be what happens.

 On Feb. 5, the council will be hosting the 
first annual Winter Triton Festival. This will be 
the first full-scale Winter Quarter event since 
WinterFest, which was cancelled three years ago 
after repeatedly abysmal attendance. 

On the surface, WTF seems to be the key to a 
lot of council’s event-planning problems.

Concerts are great and all, but the atmosphere 
can get too hectic at times, thanks to the impossi-
bility of finding friends in the crowd, the mass of 
sweaty bodies and the bass-consumed music, so 
the comedy event is a good compromise between 
entertainment and feasibility. 

This event will cost less than any other major 
event A.S. Council puts on. The total cost — 
including security, the venue, labor and talent — 

is estimated at $31,980. That’s a pretty diminutive 
sum compared to the $153,000 in student fees we 
shelled out for FallFest, or Sun God, at $530,000. 

Of course, it could be that WTF is the least 
expensive quarterly council event because there is 
no sustainable funding for it. But because of this, 
there is no permanent fund in the A.S. budget to 
pay for WTF in the future, so if council wants to 
make the festival a yearly tradition without taking 
from its own reserves, it’ll need to find a long-term 
method of funding, which could mean student 
fees.

The event is funded entirely by the council’s 
mandate reserves (meaning it takes from the coun-
cil’s backup money and not student fees).

The reduced cost of having comedians instead 
of musical acts may be a great way to get quality 
entertainment for less. Standup comedy shows 
have been wildly successful at other campuses, 
like UCLA’s sold-out comedy Campus Events 
Commission speakers series featuring Aziz Ansari 
this past May. 

The idea of bringing a comedy event to UCSD 
was introduced after the popularity of comic acts 
featured at last year’s Sun God Festival, accord-
ing to event organizers Brian Wong and Kristina 

Pham.
One of the comedians who performed at 

Sun God, Donald Glover, is returning to do 
a set at WTF. His claim to fame is his role on 
NBC’s “Community,” and as a writer for “30 Rock” 
and has had his own stand-up special on Comedy 
Central. Dat Phan, the original winner of NBC’s 
“Last Comic Standing,” will also be performing.

The talent, for one, should be spectacu-
lar. Wong’s office should push the brand names 
that come with the talent, such as “Community” 
and “Last Comic Standing,” because while students 
may not know the comedians by name, the shows 
they appear on are certainly worth a double take.

But the fact that the only thing that’s con-
firmed is the talent and the location is alarm-
ing — especially given that the event is in only 
two weeks. 

According to Oliver Zhang, Media Assistant 
of the A.S. Concerts and Events office, no further 
details will be released until everything is con-
firmed. This means less information for every-
one, and less information means less buzz and 
less success.

While event organizers claim WTF has been 
promoted by teaser posters — and although there 

Far from being the event of  the quarter, the Winter Triton Festival will be the disaster of  the quarter if  A.S. Council can’t 
get its act together.

OPINIONÊ TUESDAY, JANUARY 18, 2011Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

DRAWING FIRE By Johan DeLaTorre

With Little Advertising and No Room, Event Looks Bleak

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Last year I studied and interned 

abroad at the American University 
in Cairo, Egypt to study Middle 
Eastern politics and to work as a 
Media Intern for the Cairo Institute 
for Human Rights Studies. I was 
privileged to have the chance to 
explore and better appreciate my 
Egyptian heritage as well as increase 
my understanding of the Arabic lan-
guage and culture.

 Even over there, news of the 
noose at Geisel and a string of igno-
rant incidents at UCSD last year 
wafted over seas — the stench of 
misunderstanding and utter col-
legiate stupidity spreading halfway 
around the world.

Upon return, I have been disap-
pointed and dismayed at the contin-
ued ignorance and prejudice I have 
encountered around campus, specifi-
cally regarding the Arab and Muslim 
community and the Middle East. 
When I am in company with friends 
whom are students studying abroad 
here from Egypt, I have repeatedly 
heard remarks of a derogatory nature 
directed toward them, such as the 
words “terrorist” and “jihad”. 

This is no way to treat our guests, 
and certainly not a way to work 
towards peaceful relations between 
Muslims, Arabs and “the West”.

I pray that as students we can fol-
low President Barack Obama’s call 

to “expand our moral imaginations” 
that he made in his recent speech in 
Tucson, Ariz., and to follow UCSD’s 
Principles of Community concerning 
diversity and equity.

I pray that the administration 
will work to encourage a respect-
ful dialogue around difficult issues 
such as the Palestinian and Israeli 
situation, and engender respect 
and understanding of the Arab and 
Muslim communities on campus and 
in America. 

Steps to such cross-cultural cul-
tivation must include expanding our 
Middle East Studies program and 
providing spaces for interfaith dia-
logue at the university.

If we are truly to be known as 
making a positive impact upon 
our community and nation, then 
we must work harder to educate 
students and community members 
to treat our guests and neighbors 
with the respect and dignity that all 
human beings deserve.

Thank you.

 — Chris “Kareem” McCoy
Senior, Eleanor Roosevelt College

will be future advertising now that 
the event’s talent has been revealed 
—  the fact that nobody on campus 
has seen these advertisements is not 
comforting. Most of the students 
have no idea what the Winter Triton 
Festival is, which means that the AVP 
of Concerts and Events, Brian Wong, 
only has two weeks to get the entire 
school excited for the event, lest it fol-
low WinterFest’s dismal legacy. 

One can only hope that it won’t 
be as bad as last spring’s Sun God 
advertising campaign that involved 
distributing bookmarks with images 
of the artists on Library Walk. Stand-

up comedy is an interactive and 
intimate art, with an active audience 
essential to the performance’s feel and 
direction. 

The biggest mistake Wong could 
have made, and has made, was to 
schedule the performances in the 
Price Center West Ballroom, with the 
option of viewing a live feed of the 
show at The Loft for overflow. 

WTF is supposed to be an event 
for the entire school, yet this venue 
has a capacity of just over 850. For a 
‘big’ winter event, that figure is pretty 
exclusive. While watching the show 
squished in the 200-person Loft on a 
wide screen doesn’t seem like much 

of a consolation prize, assuming high 
attendance, those students will be 
lucky to see the show at all. 

Free for students and funded by 
previous classes, this event might 
have otherwise been worthy of total 
praise. The performers are sure to be 
great, and WTF will offer students 
entertainment they normally wouldn’t 
be exposed to otherwise. 

But the Concerts and Events office 
needs to get it together immediately 
to build the kind of hype that will 
bring students to PC West in droves 
come Feb. 5. No one wants to attend 
an event without knowing what there 
is to look forward to.

Despite the lack of magic — and the very real presence of gravity — 
UCSD now has its very own Quidditch Club. The club is comprised of 
eight teams that meet twice a week on Muir Field to reenact the popular 
Harry Potter sport. 

“It combines the nerviness of UCSD students with competitive sports 
and brings all [the] Harry Potter fans together for a chance to live out our 
magical fantasies,” Eleanor Roosevelt College sophomore Nick Johnsen 
said. Johnsen is and team captain of the Hurdling Hufflepuffs.

The club was started recently by four friends, attracting over 100 
regular members who held their first game on Jan. 10. Every Monday 
and Thursday between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m., two teams of roughly 20 people 
each play two games, with 14 people on the field at any given time, not 
including the referee. Team names are a mix of wizard-world jargon and 
clever tongue-in-cheek: Badassilisks, Rumbleroar’s Army, and BAMF 
(Bad Ass Muggle Fliers) are among the most memorable.

The founders include Muir College sophomores Hannah Green 
and Matt Levin, 
Muir College 
junior Joanne 
Ho and Eleanor 
R o o s e v e l t 
College sopho-
more Megan 
Alcalay. They 
describe the 
sport as a cross 
between soc-
cer and water 
polo, in which 
players move 
around the field and try to score goals (as in soccer) using one hand like 
a water polo player, while the other hand holds a broom between the 
player’s legs. 

 “It’s basically exactly like it is in the books and movies,” Ho said. “Just 
instead of flying, you’re riding on a broom.”

The official rules of Quidditch are outlined in the handbook of the 
International Quidditch Association, of which the club is a registered 
chapter. Players score points by throwing quaffles through the goal 
post past a keeper (or goalie), while opponents try to knock them off 
their brooms using bludgers. The game ends only when the snitch has 
been caught, meaning that the Seeker has grabbed the snitch from the 
snitch-runner, who can run anywhere in Muir College, including trees 
and rooftops. 

The club makes creative use of everyday objects for lack of enchanted 
equipment: red soccer balls take the place of quaffles, dodge balls are 
used for bludgers and a tennis ball in a sock hanging from the back of 
the snitch-runner’s shorts replaces the snitch. For goal posts, Levin and 
teammate David Renteria, another Muir College sophomore, warped 
PVC pipes and hula hoops, sticking them together with duct tape. 

Finding good brooms has proven difficult. Since the group has no 
other source of funding, they were forced to buy brooms at the dol-
lar store. Johnsen said his favorite moment on the pitch was when he 
received a gash in his arm from a broomstick while playing keeper.

“It’s exciting because it was our first game and everyone was having 
so much fun and getting so aggressive [that] we got lost in the excite-
ment,” he said. 

The club hopes to receive funding from A.S. Council soon to put

Few start their life’s work at the age of four. But for  associ-ate professor of music and classical composer Lei Liang — whose parents were both music historians — it only 
made sense to follow their lead. 

Not that he always enjoyed it.
“I was bored to death when I was practicing,” Liang said. 

“So I just started making up my own music on the piano. I 
started to compose my own pieces. But my parents were pretty 
lenient — they let me just make some sound on the piano for 
30 minutes every day and that counted as practice.”

Liang has graduated from plunking around aimlessly to 
composing his own pieces, to wide acclaim.  In 2009, the pro-
fessor was awarded the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship for 
the duration of 2009 and 2010 for his accomplishments in the 
music industry  — which include composing countless pieces 
over a lifetime and winning Harvard’s George Arthur Knight 
prize in 2006.  

In addition to teaching that year, Liang composed numer-
ous concert pieces. His favorite, titled “Verge,” was written for 
the string section of the New York Philharmonic — the oldest 
orchestra in America. Liang worked with 18 musicians and the 
final piece was roughly 12 minutes long.

“It was based on the birth of my son, who had just been 
born as I was writing the piece,” Liang said of his firstborn, 
Albert, who is now 17 months old and who enjoys listening to 
“Verge” when he’s upset. “I transformed his name into many 
possible musical expressions. It’s called ‘Verge’ because it was 
composed on the verge of his birth.”

In the time between his first tinkling melodies and achiev-
ing professional success, Liang was border-hopping. The 
Chinese-born composer lived in Beijing, China, learning 
conservatory-style music until he was 17 years old, then trav-
eled to Texas to further his musical education. Liang left for

Boston in 1992 to pursue undergraduate and graduate 
degrees in music, from the New England Conservatory 
of Music and Harvard University, respectively.

“I was not taught about Chinese music when I was 
growing up,” Liang said. “After I came to America, I 
became very interested in Chinese music because I 
suddenly realized how little I knew about where I came 
from.”

Though Liang mostly works with classical music, 
he is very interested in Chinese history and culture, 
and makes a point of expressing his 
opinions on the ever-changing Chinese 
society in his pieces. Liang frequently 
uses Chinese instruments when com-
posing  new works. 

“When you’re composing a piano 
piece, you think about what has been 
done already,” Liang said. “But there 
are also things that have not been done 
yet. That’s one approach, and the other 
is, ‘What do you want to say with this 
piece?’”

Though Liang has been composing 
for years, the creative process can still 
prove difficult, especially when faced 
with the task of composing pieces for 
instruments he does not play (Liang 
plays the piano and the guqin, an ancient 
seven-string Chinese instrument).

“Your hands can be conditioned by the instruments 
you know,” Liang said. “I know the piano very well and 
when I write for other instruments, like for strings, my 
mind is conditioned to how my fingers move on the 
keyboard.”

Still, Liang doesn’t compose using a piano reduction 
(which involves writing the piano part and then build-
ing the rest of the orchestra’s sound from there). Instead, 
Liang writes pieces for the entire orchestra, reversing the 
old method of composing from a reduction. 

As a result, sometimes it would take Liang a year to 
write a 10-minute piece. Other times, it took only an 
afternoon. The longest piece Liang has composed thus 
far is 20 minutes — a record he’s about to break.

“I am writing a very long piece for our percussion 
faculty here,” Liang said.“That’s going to be 70 minutes 
long. I started working on it last year.”

Throughout his career, Liang’s greatest musical influ-
ences have been familiar names — Claudio Monteverdi, 
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and György Kurtág. Of 
his teachers, Liang’s biggest inspirations were Robert 
Cogan, Sir Harrison Birtwistle and a Mongolian musi-

cian, Serashi.
“When I listen to [Serashi’s] music, I just [feel] that 

the music projects such a sense of vastness of space and 
solitude,” Liang said. “It’s not only the Western compos-
ers who are my models. I look at him as the person I 
want to communicate to when I write music.”

With so many positive role models, the switch 
from composer to teacher was a natural one for Liang, 
who joined UCSD’s faculty in 2007 and teaches four to 
five courses a year. Additionally, Liang has lectured at 
Harvard, Stanford, Northwestern and numerous other 

universities, including some overseas.
“When you’re a student, you’re discov-

ering a lot of things by being exposed to 
different resources,” Liang said. “When you 
become a teacher, there is an enlarged inner 
space in your imagination already, and it’s a 
matter of deepening that search. I have felt 
they have a lot to offer.”

His students seem to feel the same about 
the youthful professor.

“Instead of imposing restrictions on 
his students, he encourages us to explore 
knowledge and expertise in the music areas 
that we are interested in, but with imagina-
tion and a critical point of view,” Yeung-
ping Chen, a Ph.D. student in composition,  
said.

Owen Ferro, a Muir College graduate, 
expanded on Chen’s thoughts.

“[Liang] has a sincerity for creating music that is 
a constant source of inspiration for those fortunate 
enough to know him,” Ferro said. “As a scholar, com-
poser and a musician, he is a master craftsman and an 
artist who is not afraid to create something beautiful.”

UCSD’s New Quidditch Team Gets 100 
Members in the First Few Months, Sans Magic

toward purchasing new brooms, 
though they’re precariously  duct 
taping the ends of the old brooms in 
the meantime. The group currently 
requests a one-time $10 fee from 
each new member, which funds the 
purchase of Quidditch team shirts.

Although whimsical by defini-
tion, Quidditch is not without a 
rough side, and the IQA recom-
mends that all players wear shin 
guards, mouth guards and cleats 
while playing. But Ho insists that it 

is a sport for everyone.
“If you love tackling peo-

ple, you should be a chas-
er,” Ho said. “I love dodge-
ball so I’m a beater for sure. 

Some people love being a keeper, like 
a goalie and if you just love having 
people chase after you and wrestling 
them, you should be a snitch.”

Alcalay added that they try to 
keep the games as friendly as pos-
sible.

“Luckily, the people who have 

been coming out are friendly, good 
people. You’d have to be if you’re 
coming to run around with a broom-
stick between your legs.”

The club plans on holding fund-
raisers in the near future to raise 
funds for Book Aid International, 
an organization that gives books to 
needy children. 

“We’re trying to spread the joy of 
Harry Potter, the joy of books and 
reading in general,” Ho said. 

Students looking to join the club 
should search the UCSD Quidditch 
Facebook group for updates, and can 
visit their website  at http://www.ucs-
dquidditch.com when it launches in a 
few weeks. Showing up at Muir Field 
during game time is also encouraged.

“We don’t turn anyone away,” 
Alcalay said. “We know it’s kind of 
like a magical fantasy sport, but it’s all 
about having fun and taking a break 
from school.”

INFOCUS A CONTROVERSIAL HISTORY: MOUNT SOLEDAD CROSS

As you drive down the I-5 near Soledad South, 
it’s hard not to notice the 
43-foot cross jutting out 
from the peak of Mount 
Soledad. Located 10 min-
utes from campus on public 

property, the cross has been the 
centerpiece of a Korean War memo-
rial for over 50 years. 

Due to its location, the cross 
started a war of constitutionality and 
litigation that started in 1989 and 
has snowballed since. 

Because the memorial is on pub-
lic land, veteran Philip Paulson filed 

suit, claiming it displayed religious prefer-
ence (Paulson is an atheist). 

The plaintiffs in the case — the American 
Civil Liberties Union and Jewish War 
Veterans — contend that the “Easter” cross 
represents only Christian men and women 
who died in the war. The defendants, veterans 
from the Mt. Soledad Memorial Association, 
insist that the cross represents the sacrifice of 
all who gave their lives in service  — not just 
the Christians. 

While both sides want to honor fallen 
soldiers, neither can agree on how to do so.  
On Jan. 4, a decision from the Ninth Circuit 
Court of Appeals ruled the cross unconstitu-
tional. Judge Margaret McKeown stated that 

“the Memorial could [definitely] be modified 
to pass constitutional muster.”  

But just a few days after the ruling, three 
Republican Congressmen introduced a bill 
to block the memorial’s removal — and this 
past Saturday, hundreds gathered on the 
mountaintop to protest the same. According 
to KGTV San Diego, because of the per-
sistent nature of the debate, many believe 
the matter will be ultimately settled in the 
Supreme Court.

The Memorial is open to the public from 
7 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day.

respect.

haps the biggest of the night for the 
Tritons.

“I was due, I was overdue,” 
McGrath said. “I had a rough shoot-
ing night. The balls just wouldn’t 
fall, which happens. But my coaches 
kept telling me to keep shooting, 
and Casey [Ryan] trusted me at the 
end, and it was a big shot for us.”

The Tritons clamped down 
defensively in the second overtime 
and allowed the Golden Eagles only 
two field goals. With the Tritons up 
75-73 with 12 seconds remaining, 
Ryan missed a pair of free throws to 
give Cal State L.A. one last chance. 
Norris took the rebound and 
attempted to go coast-to-coast to 
tie the game, but the Tritons forced 
him into another tough shot on the 
baseline and UCSD held on for the 
victory.

“I thought it showed tremendous 
growth on the part of our team to 
stay mentally tough throughout,” 
Carlson said. “We’ve been through 
these kinds of games on the road, 
and just weren’t able to pull it out.”

Carlson said a loud UCSD crowd 

helped the team in a close game.
“It’s so important to have that 

support,” Carlson said. “It really 
gives you that little burst of energy. 
I don’t think we necessarily have to 
have that all the time, but it’s such a 
great thing to have a crowd.” 

The Tritons out-rebounded the 
Golden Eagles 56-38 that night.

“First off, Cal State L.A. is a 
very, very good rebounding team,” 
Carlson said. “We know that’s some-
thing we have to hang our hat on, 
and it has to be there for us. So for 
us to be plus-18 on the rebound 
count against this team is a consid-
erable thing.”

Against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills on Saturday night, the Tritons 
made it tough for the nation’s 
seventh-ranked team, but ultimately 
fell as the Toros pulled away in the 
final minutes. 

CSUDH’s Cal State Dominguez 
Hill’s Zareh Zargaryan had a game-
high 14 points in a game that was 
marked by outstanding defenses on 
both sides. Brue and McGrath had 
11 points apiece to lead the Tritons.  

The game’s tempo was slow 

throughout, especially in the first 
half. The teams went into the break 
with the score 23-19, as neither side 
could find any rhythm on the offen-
sive end.

The Toros got things going 
offensively in the second half, and 
led by nine points with 8:32 to play. 
But the Tritons came roaring back 
thanks to some clutch shooting by 
Brue and Hatch, who scored 10 
points for the Tritons over a four-
minute stretch to bring the score to 
49-48. 

The Toros responded with a 
quick 5-0 run, and hit their free 
throws in the final minute to seal 
the win.

“They were taking a lot of the 
shots we wanted them to take, and 
they just made them,” Carlson said. 
“You’ve got to hand it to them for 
doing that.”

The Tritons will stay at home 
this week, with games on Thursday 
and Saturday against Cal State San 
Bernardino and Cal Poly Pomona.

UCSD 20-12 down low. 
“Credit Cal State L.A. tonight, 

they just played their guts out,” head 
coach Charity Elliott said. “They 
played extremely hard, they hit a 
ton of shots and we got back on our 
heels a little bit when they made their 
run. I felt like that was the biggest 
issue. We got a little timid, and I told 
the team after the game [that] two 
months ago we would have lost that 
game.” 

The Tritons missed 15 out of their 
first 17 shots, while Cal State L.A. 
guard Gretchen Tiernan scored 11 
out of her 17 points in the second 
period to cut the Triton lead down 
to three points with eight minutes 
remaining. Alisha Belt also came up 
big for the Golden Eagles, posting 17 
points and 11 boards.

UCSD was able to hold on to the 
win with major contributions from 
sophomore forward Erin Grady, 
whose last-minute layup extended 
the Triton lead to five points with 50 
seconds left. Grady ended the night 
with 12 points and six rebounds.

“Tonight, we managed to hang on 
and get the win, and I’d rather win 
ugly than lose pretty any day of the 
week,” Elliott said.

On Saturday, Osga led the Tritons 
in scoring again, putting away 22 
points in 25 minutes to lead UCSD to 
their sixth consecutive victory with 
a comfortable 74-45 win against Cal 
State Dominguez Hills.

The only player in the game to 
collect double-digit points, Osga was 
stellar from the perimeter, finishing 
8-11 from the field and 6-7 on three-
point attempts.  

Grady, freshman forward Erin 
Dautremont and Carlisle — recently 

named CCAA player of the week — 
all contributed eight points apiece 
with limited playing time.

The Toros opened up the scor-
ing with a three-pointer from guard 
Hillarie Grant, but the Tritons 
responded, going on a 10-0 run to go 
up 13-3. 

With a bout of good shooting, 
Cal State Dominguez Hills snuck 
back into the game to cut the lead 
down to one with 13 minutes left 
in the first half, but that was the 
closest the Toros would come. A 
three-pointer from Carlisle fol-
lowed by a layup from Dautremont 
extended the lead to six points, and 
from there excellent shooting from 
the Tritons — who were 54 percent 
from the field in the first half — 
kept the game out of reach for the 
Toros.

“We always talk about getting 
good passes for a good shot,” Elliott 
said. “Tonight we had a lot of nice 
passes that led to great shots for our 
shooters. And we have some good 
ones.” 

With the pair of wins, the 
Tritons improve to 8-2 in confer-
ence and 10-7 overall.  

“We’re on a roll right now, and 
we’re going to keep it going,” said 
Osga. “This weekend is going to be 
big, so we have to have good prac-
tice and get after it again.”

UCSD has two more games at 
home this week. The Tritons will 
face Cal State San Bernardino — 
who currently sits in second in the 
conference — on Thursday, Jan. 20 
and third-place Cal Poly Pomona 
on Saturday, Jan. 22.

The UCSD men’s basketball team split its weekend games against two of the conference’s top teams, 
beating Cal State L.A. 76-73 in a back-and-
forth double overtime game before losing 
a tight 57-49 affair with No. 7 Cal State 
Dominguez Hills.

On Thursday night against Cal State 
Los Angeles, junior center Christian 
Hatch led the way with 26 points and 13 
rebounds, while senior guard Casey Ryan 
added 12 points and a career-high 20 
boards. Sophomore forward Justin Brue 
had 17 points, five rebounds and four 
assists for the Tritons.

The Tritons came out hot, shooting 43 
percent in the first half. UCSD effectively 
broke the Golden Eagles’ press and played 
well defensively, going into the half with a 
35-27 lead. 

But the Golden Eagles clamped down 
in the second half, and limited the Tritons 
to 33 percent shooting while shooting 54 
percent themselves. CSULA’s 6’6” forward 
David Norris came alive as well, scoring 16 
of his 24 points in the half. Norris’s three-
pointer with 8:24 remaining tied the score 
at 48.

A Christian Hatch bucket tied the score 
59-59 with 1:01 left on the clock. The 
Tritons forced Norris into a tough shot 
and got the defensive stop, and held for 
the final shot without calling a timeout. 

Hatch’s jumper missed, and the Tritons 
were unable to get another shot off before 
the buzzer sounded, despite an offensive 
rebound.

Neither team played well in the first 
overtime, but the Golden Eagles hit their 
free throws to take a five-point lead with 
1:18 left. Brue hit a jumper for the Tritons 
to bring the score to 66-63, and Norris 
missed a three to give the Tritons a chance 
with 17 seconds remaining. Ryan drove 
in the middle and kicked to sophomore 
guard Tyler McGrath, who nailed a three-
pointer to tie the score at 66 and send the 
game into a second overtime. 

“The shot was great,” head coach Chris 
Carlson said. “That was great execution. 
Those two guys, having played together 
for a bit, know how to work off each other. 
And Tyler [McGrath] made a great adjust-
ment and made the shot.”

McGrath had only six points on the 
night off the bench, but his shot was per-

Tritons Suffer Letdown After UCI Upset

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The UCSD men’s vol-
leyball team came off its 3-1 upset win against UC 
Irvine this Wednesday only to be taken in three 
against No. 5 UC Santa Barbara on Friday. The 
games brought the team to 1-1 in the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation and 2-3 overall.

“The things that we did well Wednesday night 
against Irvine, we talked about that and those are 
the things that we’re going to need to do well to win 
nationals and be really competitive in the MPSF,” 
head coach Kevin Ring said. “I don’t think there’s a 
hang over from that. I felt like we had an extremely 
good practice [Thursday] and we were extremely 
confident coming in.”

The set scores went 25-22, 25-18 and 25-21. 
The Tritons came out strong and had the lead 5-4 
in the first set.  The teams traded scores, but UCSD 
brought it up to 8-5 with kills by junior opposite 
hitter Shane Veiga and senior setter Phil Bannan. 
UCSD kept the lead but was left in the dust after a 
six-point run from the Gauchos.

“We’ve got an inexperienced team, a young team, 
out on court and playing in those moments we had 
in game one,” Ring said. 

“We were playing better through the first half of 
that game, had a two- or three-point lead and then 
they scored a few, and that’s going to happen. An 
experienced team is going to recover from that, side 
out, be able to go back and score a few points. We 
just let them back in it and let them slip away at that 
point.”

UCSB took the second set by force and, despite 
tying four times, the Tritons never led in the set.

The third set was closer as the Tritons showed 
some signs of life, but a four-point run by the 
Gauchos would put the match out of reach. 

Bannan came up with 30 assists, three service 
aces, four digs and a solo block. Veiga showed 
a match-high of 12 kills and added seven digs. 
Freshman middle blocker Sebastian Brady led 
Triton offense, flooring seven kills with no errors in 
nine swings for a .778 attack percentage. 

But the Tritons hit just .194 (36-18-93) on the 
night, while UCSB left them stumbling with a .407 
(41-8-81) clip. 

The Tritons will take on top-ranked University 
of Southern California at RIMAC Arena for a 7 p.m. 
match on Friday, Jan. 21.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The UCSD 
women’s basketball team strung together 
two more wins this week at home, with a 
close 69-65 finish against Cal State L.A. on 
Thursday and a 74-45 win against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on Saturday.

The Tritons went into their game 
against Cal State L.A. having won their 
last four conference games, and their nine 
match-ups against the Golden Eagles. The 
Tritons took that momentum into the first 
half, outplaying and outscoring a more 
physical CSULA squad 40-28. 

Junior guard Chelsea Carlisle — the 
Tritons’ top scorer and main offensive 
threat in their previous six games — 

caught fire early on, scoring seven points 
in the first seven minutes. The Golden 
Eagles defense soon collapsed on the All-
American, allowing Carlisle only two more 
points for the rest of the half.  

Increased defensive cover on Carlisle 
opened up opportunities for Triton sopho-
more shooting guard Emily Osga, who 
scored 12 out of her 17 points in the first 
half. The junior guard went three for four 
from behind the arc while also tallying 13 
rebounds to record her first career double-
double. 

Cal State L.A. pushed back in the sec-
ond half, going 50 percent from the field 
and dominating the Tritons in the paint, 
amassing seven blocks and outscoring

“We performed at an even level 
with the No. 7 team in the country 
for quite a bit of that game.”
