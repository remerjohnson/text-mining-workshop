HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -
Engineers slowly shrank a 
potentially explosive gas 
bubble in the reactor of the 
Three Mile Island nuclear plant 
yesterday, as President Carter 
visited the plant and suggested 
a precautionary evacuation 
may be necessary within a few 
days. 

A spokesman for the utility 
that runs the crippled 
powerhouse said last night that 
the bubble, which has 
measured as high as 1,800 cubic 
feet at times, was gauged as 
low as 222 cubic feet yesterday. 

"It's now back over 400 cubic 
feet , but that just means we 've

Three Now Left 
in Provost Search 
Saltman Will Name Choice for 
Revelle Position This Week 

By John Hondros 
Associate News Editor 

The search for a Revelle 
College Provost has narrowed 
to three candidates, and Vice 
Chancellor of Academic Affairs 
-Paul Saltman said yesterday he 
will decide on one of the three 
for the position early this week. 

The post was l~ft vacant by 
June Tapp at the end of the last 
school year, and has been 
temporarily filled by Ralph 
Lovberg. 

The three finalists recom-
mended ' by the Search 
Committee for Revelle Provost 
are: Chia-Wei Woo, chairper-
son of Physics at N orth-
western; Karl Lamb, acting 
provost at Cowell College, UC 
Santa Cruz; and Stanley 
Chodorow, professor of bistory 
at UCSD. These candidates 
were selected unanimously by 
the Committee, according to 
Third Colleee Provost Joseph 
Wataon who is a member of the 
Search Committee. 

The select committee formed 
in Nov. as an advisory eroup to 
Saltman. Committee members 
are: J~an Mandler (chair), 
Alfred Manaster, Harry Subl, 
Stanley Schatt, Watson, Rou 
Beveridge and Mary Anne 
Rodgers. 

The Search Committee bas 
reviewed about 300 applicants 
for the nationally advertised 
position, accordiOl to WalBon. 

"After extensive reviewin;, 
(the Committee) narrowed it 
down to 30 candidates ... we then 
consulted with thedepartmenu 
at UCSD, and that brouaht (the 
number of candidates) down to 
seven," explained W allon. Of 
the seven, four candidate. were 
interviewed and the Committee 
recommended three, he said. 

" (The Committee) bas met a 
ereat deal...and we feel very 
comfortable with the candi-
dates," remarked Watson. 

While reviewiq the ap-
plicants, the Committee looked 
for persoDS with "extensive 
involvement at the under-
graduate level," said Watson.

Troffer, manager of generation 
quality for Metropolitan 
Edison. "It slo~ up and down, 
but the ' trend "is definitely 
downward," he said. , Route 21 Will Return The Search Committee took three factors into consideration when judging the applicants: 1) 

The candidate must have 
credentials in a department 
that is offered at UCSD, and 
must have a strong record of 
scholarship in that area; 2) 
applicants who have extensive 
academic experience, rather 
than a career primarily in 
business, industry, the military 
or the government were . 
preferred; and 3) applicants 
who have come from a major 
research university were 
preferred. 

Joe Fouchard, spokesman 
for the U.S. Nuclear Regu-
latory Commission, confirmed 
the report, but remained 
cautious. There were "some 
encouraging signs on bubble 
size," he said. But he noted that 
engineers were recomputing 
the size estimates to make sure.

On~ Released 
-Two Charged With 
Making Quaaludes 

Three UCSD students were arrested by County Narcotics Task 
Force officers March 27 on drug conspiracy charges. 

John Bell and Jeffrey Erlich were arrested in their Pacific 
Beach apartment, and Richard Lapping was arrested in his home 
in Del Mar. 

~1I and Erlich were indicted Friday by a federal grand jury, 
wbl.te the charges against Lapping were dropped. The case was 
aSSigned to US District Judge Howard Turrentine for trial. 

Bell and Erlich are charged with conspiracy to manufacture 
methaqualone and possession of the drug with intent to distribute 
it, according to the Los Angeles Times . 

The students were arrested following a three-month 
inve~tigution by the tusk force. At the time of the arrest, agents 
confl~cuted four kilograms (approximately nine pounds) of 
chemicals used to manufacture the methaqualone sedative the 
Times reported . The substances obtamed have an estimated 
street value of $80,000. 

Methaqualone is commonly known as quaalude - a powerful 
recreational barbituate. 

less heavily used than other 
routes which were cut, he 
explained. 

According to Sandstrom, 
route 21 is a "middle route" 
which requires six to eight 
drivers. With the restoration of 
service to the seven routes in 
May, " we used up all the 
drivers," he remarked. 

Last week the Board adopted 
a five-year plan which calls for 
"a five cent (fare) increase 
each year. " according to 
Sandstrom. Although " we may 
be able to skip a year," he 
commented, a fare increase is 
inevitable. 

The first proposed increase 
will accompany the targeted 
date for service restoration to 
route 21 on July 1, when the 
company's new budget begins. 
According to Sandstrom, "all 
the money will go to more 
services. " 
. While Sandstrom spoke of a 
five-cent fare increase, he did 
not rule out the possibility of a 
dime increase during the year. 

The decision on such an 
increase will be made within 
the next 60 days , said 
Sandstrom. 

The transit company's top 
priority is to return cut routes 
to .. their former service level, " 
remarked Sandstrom. Night 
service, which was ' sharply 
curtailed during the Jan . 
cutbacks, will slowly be 
reinstated with an increased 
availability of drivers, he said.

Housing Bill Passes, 
More Tests Ahead 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Associate Manalin, Editor 

Assembly Bill 224, which would prohibit discrimination against 
students In housing, passed the Assembly March 19, and will run 
'nto tough sledding in the Senate, UC Student Lobby Co-Director 
Bret Hewitt said yesterday. 

"It's not the legislature it wa last year, and not the best 
legls~ature to try and get (the housing bill) through," Hewitt said, 
predicting a "difficult" time for the bill in the Senate. 

It will now go to the Senate Committee on Local Governments, a 
change from the more conservative committees the bill was 
assigned to in previous ~'ears. 

If it should pass the Senate, it will then go to Governor Brown's 
desk for approval or veto. Hewitt says Brown " hasn't made a 
stand, but his administration supports it." By that, Hewitt meant 
that the part of the bureaucracy concerned with the bill the 
Housing and Redevelopment Department, had announced its 
support for the bill . 

The bill passed the Assembly 41·37, with no votes to spare. A 
number of leei.lators switched their votes on the bill, which had 
lost 37-38 earlier in March before the lame body. One of those who 
didn't change their vote was Republican Assemblyman Bob

Apartheid Mines US For Sales 
By Earl Ofarl 

Padfte Newt Service 
"There was never a time 

wben gold wasn't valuable,," 
say the ads from the Gold 
Information Center. "Turn 
some of your labor into gold." 

SoUDd interesting? More and 
more Americans think so, as 
inClation and 'the declining 
value of the dollar push gold 
prices through the roof. Just 
don't call the Gold Information 
Center if you're interested in 
buying. 

"We don't have a product to 
sell, " says manager Leslie 
Mirrin, "so we don't want the 
public contacting us." 
E.. Ofarl is .,.blle-affain 
... .,. for KPFK radio, Los 
Altl"', and the author of ''The 
MydI of Black CapUallun." 

But the center's parent 
ol'laniJation, the Internationai 
Gold Company or Intergold, 
... bave a product to sell -
the Krugerrand, South Africa's 
one troy ounce gold coin. 
later,old Is aNew York 
corporation owned by the South 
African Chamber of Mines, a 
quasi·governmental trade 
auociation representing 115 
corporations and mining 
compa_ in South Africa. 

later,old and the Gold 
Information Center are part of 
an International campaign to 
leU the Krugerrand, Involving 
banks, trust companies, 
depoaitories, coin wholesalers, 
lov.rnment agencies, and 
finally, thousands of mlddle-
Income investors who see gold 
coin. as a hedge against 
Inflation. 

Because the sale of 
Krugerrands currently 
amounts to nearly 20 percent of 
South Africa's total foreign 
exhange earnings, the coins 
have been the focus of protest 
campaigns opposing the South 
African apartheid system. But 
protests or DOt, sales of the 
Krugerrand since 1970 have 
approached 20 million coins, 
each currently valued at $220, 
the market price of an ounce of 
gold. 

The United States has now 
been targeted by Intergold and 
the South African gold 
producers as the major market 

area for the coin. Rather than 
showing signs of diminishing, 
the public campaign to sell the 
Krugerrand is moving ahead 
full throttle. 

"Gold is gold is gold," says a 
coin broker for a major West 
Coast coin agency. "There are 
no politics involved in our 

. / 

sales, " he says , "only 
business." 

But groups such as the New 
York-based Committee on 
Africa see things differently . 
"There is no more direct way to 
invest in the oppression of 
apartheid than to invest in the 
Krugerrand," says Paul Irish, 

aSSOCiate director of the 
Committee. "The profits go 
directly to the South African 
government for the purchase of 
arms, oil and other equipment 
that maintains the apartheid 
system. " 

The Committee has won 
some notable victories in its 

campaign against the Kruger-
rand , following negotiations 
with the Committee, the 
National Council of Churches 
and the National Conference of 
Black Lawyers. 

And in January 1978, Merrill 
Lynch, the big brokerage firm . 
announced that it would stop all 
sales of the coin through its 
branch offices. 

However, says Irish, " Small 
investors a re now getting into 
the market who have little 
concern for the issues involved, 
or are ignorant of them. 

" We've achieved victories 
and 'created a national 
awareness of what the 
Krugerrand represents, " he 
says. " But in a sense we've 
been winning a battle and 
losing the war , as long as the 
present economic conditions 
prevail. .. 

The power behind the sales 
campaign is the Johannesburg-
based South African Chamber 
of Mines . The Chamber 
rna rkets the coins in te r-
nationally through Intergold, 
and also administers the mines 
which control nearly all of 
South Africa's gold production. 

As part of its mine 
administration, the Chamber 
also recruits workers , 90 
percent of whom are black, 
Their monthly wage of $115 is 
about one-fourth that of white 
workers ($563) . This gives the 
mining industry the dubious 
distinction of having the largest 
income gap between the two 
races of any industry in South 
Africa . 

With so much success with 
the Krugerrand and gold sales, 
what is the next step for 
Intergold? An executive with 
the corporation says that more 
of its marketing and ad-
vertising dollars will go toward 
the promotion of gold jewelry. 
Television ads are already 
appearing in some parts of the 
country. 

The best bet is that those 
sparkl1ng 14K bracelets and 
chains will contain South 
African gold. " You have to 
figure, " says Leslie Mirrin of 
the Gold Information Center, 
"that the percentage of gold in 
the jewelry is about the same 
(90 percent) that South Africa 
produces for --the free wornt 

, market." 

UC Image Investigation Looks Bad 
/ 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
A.sociale Manalio, Editor 

The lexicon of politics has 
produced all kinds of phrases 
new to the American public. It 
is no longer possible to take a 
picture of President Carter, for ' 
example. What that man with a 
camera is actually doing is 
"exerCising a photo oppor-
tunity. " 

Similarly, when the media 
talks to itself in front of the 
public, it Is engaging in a 
"media event," something 
which originally appeared in 
politics as a candidate's way of 
• etting as much publicity for 
them_lves as possible. 

There was a media event In 
the Bay Area last week that 
ceDtered on the University of 
Callfomia, but in this case, the 
umyersity's Ima.e il a little

fanfare, decided to hire Murry 
Fromson, late of CBS News and 
the Brown gubernatorial 
campaign, to look into why, 
Fromson says, "for reasons 
that are not clear, the 
University 'does nQt have the 
public support that an 
institution of this type should 
have." Fromson also cites a 
Mervin Field poll, which he 
says indicates a poor university 
public imale, as justification 
for his study. 

Fromson was hired for six 
months, If days a month, to 
examine the public information 
offices In the system and find 
out why tbe univer8ity'81malt' 
i8 alit II. 

For hi. work, Fromson 

receives $214 a day for his 
services . Multiplied by the 
number of days he'll be in UC 
employ, that is a salary of over 
$17,000. He has also been 
provided with an office and a 
secretary. 

No one really noticed that 
Fromson had t>een hired until 
last week, when the Associated 
Press picked up the slory. 
"With the University of 
California complaining about a 
shortage of funds," the story 
began, "a consultant has been 
hired to determine wily the 
university's public image is so 
low." 

KGO-TV, which has the 
di8tinction of beiq the first 
television station in tbe nation 

to use the "happy talk" news 
format, picked up the story, 
and said there was an "uproar" 
over Fromson's hiring. KPIX-
TV, the San Francisco CBS 
affiliate, recapitulated the AP' 
story for its viewer!!. 

The San Francisco Chronicle 
ran a few paragraphs of their 
own story about Fromson, 
implying that he had been hired 
to boost the image of President 
Saxon. . 

All this media attention has 
upset Fromson, thou,h he says 
he isn't surprised by it. He 
defends his job - "every large 
in.titution hires consultants'· 
- and he get. angry when he 
talk. about the kind of 
reportl", that went into the 

Associated Press and television 
stories. 

"I didn't even get a call from 
the Associated Press reporter 
who wrote that story , " 
Fromson says, "and that is 
shoddy journalism ... and there 
is no damn uproar about my 
hiring . ., 

A check of the Daily 
Californian, the Berkeley 
student newspaper, as well as 
put)lic information and student 
offices In Berkeley, seems to 
confirm Fromson's assertion 
that there has been no public 
complaint about his hiriD,.

concerned about the upcoming 
community elections, and

Editor: 
I am writing in response to 

the open letter from Jon 
Bekken to the staff of KSDT, 
which was published in The 
Guardian (Fri., March 16) . 
Without making reference (0

_States. What might ha,,-e been 
the denouement of tbe Cuban 
missile crisis if President 
Kennedy had not been able to 
order the Navy to blockade 
Cuba's seaports? Most 
probably, Russian missiles 
would now be on Cuban 
launching pads, only a few 
seconds away from New York 
City. . 

It is the high command of the 
Navy, and ultimately the 
president, tl'lat bear the 
responsibility for its actions. To 
attack the Navy's existence on 
the grounds that its power may 
have been misused during the, 
Vietnam conflict shows 
pathetic shortsightedness. 

,Sabotaging the Nav,Y's 
recruitment efforts in the 
student media benefits no one, 
and cannot but help the current 
movement to reinstitute the 
draft. KSDT's acceptance of 
the Navy ads should never have

INTERNATIONAL 
Arab Diplomats Leave Cairo in Protest 

CAIRO, ElYpt (AP) - Arab amabssadors 
began an exodus from Cairo yesterday in 
protest of Egypt's treaty with Israel, but the 
government of President Anwar Sadat said it 
would not be deterred from peace by the Arab 
uproar. 

An Arab summit conference in Baghdad, 
Iraq, ended Saturday with the announcement 

that 18 nations would punish Sadat by cutting all 
diplomatic and economic ties with Egypt. By 
last night, the amba'isadors of Saudi Aradia, 
Tunisia, Kuwait, Jordan and Bahrain had left 
Cairo, leaving their embassy staffs behind. 

Egyptian officials said they would wait to see 
to what extent the sanctions are carried out 
before deciding how to react.

Brown Asks for" Closure 
Of Rancho Seeo Plant 

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Saying "it is appropriate to err on the 
side of caution," Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. yesterday asked the 

!deral Nuclear Regulatory Commission ~o order a 
' recautionary and temporary" shutdown of a nuclear power 

,Jlant near Sacramento that is a virtual duplicate of the stricken 
reactor in Pennsylvania. 

At a hastily called news conference, Brown sidestepped 
questions about whether he would use his emergency powers to 
close the Rancho Seeo facility near Sacramento, indicating he 
wanted to leave that up to the NRC . 

"There is significant uncertainty about just what happened in 
Pennsylvania - how much of it was human error and how much 
was mechanical ," Brown said at the conference. But he added. "I 
get the impression that it 's lucky the impact wasn't worse than it 
was." 

Evacuation Possible 
(Continued [rom page I) 
relocating the elderly, invalids 
and persons in institutions such 
as hospitals and jails. 

"We'd like to have things in 
shape," commented Francis 
Hess, commissioner of Carroll 
Township, east of the plant. He 
said 1,000 copies of a public 
notice advising people what to 
do is an evacuation is ordered 
were distributed yesterday. 

Gov. Dick Thornburgh said in 
a statement Sunday night that 
schools within five miles of the 
plant should remain closed 

Monday. He said state 
government offices will be open 
as usual, but with generous 
leaves granted for "ab-
sentees." 

Although an estimated SO,OOO 
persons have fled the 
Harrisburg area since 
Wednesday's accident touched 
off the first of a continuing 
series of low-level radiation 
leaks, President Carter said 
that even if an evacuation is 
ordered, "this will not indicate 
the danger is high .. .It is purely 
a precautionary measure."

tenance crew shovelled 
charred rubble - all that was 
left of the laboratory where the 
'fire started - and carted it 
away. Laboratory technicians 
were trying to salvage books 
and equipment from adjacent 
rooms . 

In a small office across the, 
corridor, Paul Dayton, 
Associate Professor of Marine 
Ecology, was looking at a black 
mass of molten metal, from 
which protruded the scale pan 
of a laboratory balance. 

"The official report is that 
the fire was started by an 
electrical short in this scale, " 
said Dayton. "But I don't know. 
The light is smaller than a 
flashlight bUlb. And there were 
no flammable liquids in that 
laboratory. " 

Another charred relic in the 
room represented irre -
placeable loss to Dayton. It was 
the remains of a specimen 
collection from Antarctica. A 
few small glass vials were still 
identifiable in a large lump of 
cinder. "They are priceless," 
he said, "in the sense that I'll 
never go back to replace 
them." 

Dayton explained that the 
specimens of microscopic 
marine life were collected by 
diving under the ice in the 
Antarctica. He said that they 
were material he was using in 
"four to ten-year experiments" 
and estimated that "30 percent 
of the program was destroyed" 
by the fire. 

However. Dayton seemed to 
think that one of his graduate 
students was harder hit than 
he, because "her PhD thesis 
bumed up and her sponge 
collection is lone. " He said that 

although her sponges were 
mostly "local area speci-
mens," they were "time 
consuming to collect. " 

According to Dayton, he had 
a "fairly good inventory" of 
what the laboratory contained, 
and thought there would be 

' ''contingency funds" available 
from the university to replace 
the loss. 

In the meantime, "We will do 
what we can with what we 
have," he said, and added, "I 
think we can work around that 
space." 

Groundworks 
Books 
Vandalized 

Four rocks , four broken 
windows and a graffitied door 
were found the night of March 
17 at Groundworks Bookstore in 
the Student Center. The 
vandalism is estimated to have 
occured between 9pm and 11: 45 
pm. No other building reported 
damages. 

According to Sergeant Clark 
Martin. the campus police have 
no leads and "have exhausted 
whatever means we have of 
following up on it." 

Joe Cooper, a member of 
Groundworks' core collective, 
maintains that there must have 
been witnesses and asks that 
they contact the people at 
Groundworks. 

Groundworks has never had 
problems with vandalism in the 
past, although the Print Coop 
did suffer a broken window last 

- year.

Cust;odial Night Shifts Eliminated 
By John Hondros 

Assocla&e News Edl&or 
The night shift in Custodial 

Services will be eliminated in 
order to "avoid layoffs ," 
effective in June, according to 
John Stevenson, UCSD 
Custodial Services super-
intendent. Current night 
workers will be placed in either 
the 5·1 : 30 or 7-3: 30 day shifts, 
Stevenson said, 

AFSCME Representative Stronski Says Could 
Lead to Further Layoffs in Maintenance 

to the campus. "Sure, the 
change will result in a loss of 
pocket money for the night 
workers," remarked Steven-
son, " but a lot of them have said 
their wives will be happier 
because they can spend more 
time with their families." 

The switch , which was 
proposed as a budget-saving 
measure recently from the 
office of Custodial Grounds and 
Transportation Services, will 
" improve the level of cleaning 
servjces while using less 
resources," remarked 
Stevenson. 

According to Jim Stronski, 
president of th~ American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees (Local 
2(68), the night workers in the 
custodial department receive 
$26 more a month than the day 
workers. Eighty-eight cus-
todians will be affected by this 
switch, he said. Stronski 
estimates that $30,000 in night

shift differential will be saved 
by the University, 

Stronski believes this 
maneuver will lead to future 
layoffs in Custodial Services . 
As a result of the switch, the 
custodial sta ff "will be reduced 
by four to five people," he said. 
Stronski explained that this 
reduction in staff will save the 
University $180,000. 

At present . the campus 
buildings are cleaned during 
the night shift. Said Stevenson , 
"When (the custodians) come 
in the morning , the place is 
discombobulated ." He believes 
this change in scheduling will 
allow UCSD to "start the 
morning off clean." 

According to Steven on, with 
the new custodial schedule, the 
classrooms, the libraries and 
the gy'm will be cleaned during 
the early morning shift. After 8 
am, "(the custodians) go to the

offices, the corridors and the 
la bs," he said. 

Stronski ar;;ued that the day 
cleaning will interfere with hall 
traffic; " Also, bathrooms will 
be closed (during the day) 
while being cleaned." 

Stevenson believes that the 
change will cause only "small 
problems" on campus. " This 
place is a beehive at night when 
we clean it ," Stevenson 
remarked. He said that 
Custodial Services will sponsor 
a pilot program (or its workers 
beginning April 9 at University 
Hospital in order to see if there 
are problems with " cleaning 
labs when someone is there." 

According to ' Academic 
Advisor Paul Croft, several 
people from the department of 
Chemistry have written to the 
office of Custodial Grounds and 
Transportation Services , 
expressing concern over the

" The female grad students like 
to have a custodian around at 
night when working in the 
labs , " said Croft. " The 
custodians are a security force 
for them." 

The elimination of the 
custodial night shift may bring 
about an increase in " lab rip-
offs," said Croft. " The switch 
will resultin a loss of security at 
night ," commented Stronski, 
adding that " the janitors keep' 
an eye on things." 

Stronski said the shift change 
will create a "big problems" 
for the night workers because 
"they have built family 
arrangements and other job 
arrangements around that 
shift. .. 

Stevenson expressed that the 
switch will benefit the night 
workers in that it will give them 
" more of a sense of belonging"

Brig ht 
For 
Swi m mers 

By Jon Goetz 
Senior Staff Writer 

After earning a spot in the 
NAJA 's top ten swim teams in 
the nation, there seems to be no 
limit to what the UCSD 
swimmers can accomplish . 

This season they outgrew the 
Southern California smair 
college level, blowing away 
schools like Pomona-Pitzer, 
Whittier, and Cal Poly Pomona. 
Only NCAA Division I schools 
San Diego State and University 
of Nevada at Las Vegas beat 
the Tritons in dual or tri meets 
this year. Yet the UCSD times 
would have handily beaten the 
Aztecs at their end ofthe season 
Western Athletic Conference 
meet. 

What's more, all the school 
record holders who swam 
UCSD to Nationals will be 
competing again next winter. 
Only divers Brad OIwin and 
Ken Flagg will graduate this 
year. 

Joe Hernandez , Lance 
Halsted, Mark Allen, Jim 
Agronick, Nelson Howard and 
Greg McGary, who will all have 
their names hanging on the 
school record board this year, 
will be trying for the 1980 
Nationals after a rest. 

In addition to his veterans, 
Bill Morgan has been 
recruiting 12-14 hours a week to 
build the team. "I've got three 
or four guys who assured me 
they were coming here," said 
the second year coach. "But 
who knows if they'll actually 
'show up." Quite a few other 
prospects may be here next 
season also. 

That next season may have 
some treats in store for the 
athletes. if a proposed booster 
club can raise some cash. A 
parent atreed to take on fund-
raising duties. and there a're 
thoughts of sending the entire 
team to Hawaii or the Rockies.

Moyies/Ted BUrke 

'Hardcore': No Redeeming Social Importance 
T he premise for Hard-core is provocative enough: A teenage 

girl from Grand 
Rapids, Michigan vanishes in 
the course of a Calvinist youth 
retreat in Southern California, 
and the father, after seeing her 
featured in a quick buck porno 
film, goes to the West Coast to 
save her from the unclean 
grasp of the heathen flesh 
merchants . Writer-director 
Paul Schrader, who in past 
efforts (writer of Taxi Driver 
and Rolling Thunder, author 
and director of Blue Collar 
demonstrated a wild but 
usually dead-on instinct for 
dealing with desp.erate 
characters, by all rights should 
have been the man to · make 
Hardcore 'one of the more 
recent cogent social examina-
tions. in the film. 

Unfortunately, the subject 
seems too close to Schrader's 
own life for him to detach 
himself from it enough to carry 
it to the extent where the film 
would have been plausible. As a 
CalviniSt himself, Schrader 
appears ori ' the surface to ~e 
trying to reconcile his strict 
church-going background with 
his status as a Hollywood film 
maker. But each time he seems 
on the verge of coming to a 
graphic study in cultural 
contrasts, he backs off, as 
though scared. Theend result is 
that Hardcore is reduced to 
cheap melodrama and, in 
parts, an exotic travelosue 
through the porn belts of Los 
Angeles, San Diego and San 
Francisco. 

Cast Adds to 
Persuasion 
"I ntense" and "emo-

tional" are words 
wbich do little justice 

in describing Columbia's TIle 
CbJDa Syadrome. However, the 
same cannot be said lor its 
hanclIing of the controversey 
surrounding the issue of 
nuclear enerey. The motion 
picture jumps right into the 
midst of its subject content 
without hesitation or warning, 
and continUes at sucb a pace 
until the end. 

A sprinkling of newspaper 
accounts, television coverage, 
even science fiction stories are 
per!laps the extent of the 
average individual's experi-
ence with nuclear energy . 
Screenwriters Mike Gray, T.S. 
Cook and James Bridges take 
advantage oJ the viewer's 
naivete. Their story of a nearly 
fatal" accident" at a prominent 
nuclear power plant located in 
Southern California has a 
realistic ring and immediate 
identity with the audience. As a 
result , the movie has a 
tendency Lo inject a slight 
feeling of paranoia , especially 
towards the conclusion, which 
is reminiscent of the 1930's 
d iffhangt!rs and almost ruined 
by a touch of the 1970's disaster 
spectacles. 

A par-excellence cast fu rther 

The problems with lIardcore 
go further than Schrader's lack 
of guts. Except for a splendidly-
handled sequence . where he 
uses hand-held camera shots to 
roam through the Calvinist 
household as the family 
prepares for a Christmas 
di{mer with the immediate clan 
- a theological debate among 
the men in one. room, kids in the 
den watching a chorus of 
dancing Santa Clauses in the 
next, the wives preparing tt)e 
garnishes in the kitcllen - the 
entire film has a clumsy 
structure on all levels, from the 
writing to the direction. 

The basic mistake is having 
most of the film's momentum 
pivot on the action$ of the 
distl'aught father (George C. 
Scott, who's very good with 
what he has to work With. 
evoking a sort of Midwest 
graininess) . The film follows 
him, and him alone. through the 
entire length, as he first walks 
the streets of the LA porn belt in 
bug-eyed horror, to his 
eventual adopting of a 
Machiavellian attitude as he 
pretends to be a mm~producer 
casting a fake production ' in 
order to get some leads in his 
search. Other cliaracters, 
including sleazy private 
detective of indeterminate 
morals (Peter Boyle), a teen 
prostitute who aids Scott 
(Season Hubley) and a gallery 
of marginal low-lifes are flat, 
one dimensional and have no 
life or mouvaLion beyond their 
lines , spinning around 
the omniscient ' Scott in 

(Please turn 1O page 18) 

strengthens the film's 
persuasive qualities. It is 
surprising, but pleasantly so, to 
see Jane Fonda in such 
celluloid dominance these 
days. Her previously limited 
list of militant , anti-
Establishment stereotypes has 
given way to her current and 
widening range of softened, yet 
strong feminine chaFacters, of 
which newswoman Kimberly ' 
Wells is the newest addition. 

While Fonda has been 
appearing considerably on the 
screen, Michael Douglas has 
been working with equal fervor 
behind it. In The China 
Syndrome, 'his dual roles as its 
real-life producer and its 
fictional -cllmeraman Richard 
Adams demonstrate his 
expertise in both realms of film 
production . 

Another actor se ldomly seen 
is Jack Lemmon. Primarily 
known for his comedic work, he 
turned audiences around with . 
his performances in Days Of 
Wine And Roses and Save The 
Tiger. Lemmon delves into the 
dramatic once again with his 
portrayal of supervising 
engineer Jack Godell, a part 
that assures another double-
take from the viewers. 

Columbia'S The China 
Syndrome adds a new term to 
the viewer's vocabulary, as 
well .IS sheds a somewhat 
ominous light upon the 
prospeCts of nuclear energy.

The Joy of Flying - Tony 
Williams (Columbia) 

Drummer Williams has 
assembled an odd assortment 
o( talent for this album, 
including George Benson, Jan 
Hammer, Stanley Clarke, 
Brian Auger, Ronnie Montrose, 
Michael Brecker, and Cecil 
Taylor, and the predictable 
results are an unfocused mixed 
bag of pyrotechnical instru-
mental talent that rarely 
catches fire. The composing in 
general . runs the gamut of 
typical jazz/fusion cliches -
rapid unison riers, angular 
chord progressions, tediously 
quick solos - and the 
communication between 
whatever assemblage of 
musicians on any particular cut 
never clicks. They sound as 
though they were randomly 
bunched together, given the 
sheet music, and made to play 
it cold. Only the drum-piano 
interplay on Cecil Taylor's 
' ·Morgan's Way" holds the 
promise of a new direction. 
Here Williams shucks his 
arthritic rock stylings and 
supplies subtle polyrhythmic 
counterpoints to Taylor's 
structuralist conceptuali-
zations, which have a myriad of 
tonal shadings, moods, and 
senses of space that allows 
Williams to open up his 
technique, freeing it from the 
jazz rock gruel he's been sadly 

saddled with. An entire album 
of these two playing together 
would have certainly been 
more interesting than the 
meandering temperament of 
Joy of Flying. In any case, 
Williams deserves a chance to 
show what he can do. C minus.

Carlos Santana (Columbia) 

Five years ago, guitarist 
Santana recorded an album 
with the then Mahavishnu John 
MacLaughlin. The result,Love, 
Devotion, Surrender, intended 
as a high-energy tribute to 
Eastern guru Sri Chimnoy, was 
pathetic, with the rock-oriented 
Santana being hopelessly out-
classed and out-gunned by 
MacLaughlin who, to use an old 
line, plays guitar as though he 
were being paid a dollar note. 
One would have thought the 
experience would have warned 
the stylistically beautiful but 
technically limited Santana 
against flirting with jazz 
trappings , but as Oneness 
indicates, he seems more than 
willing to give it apother go. 
Like the MacLaughlin colla-
boration, Oneness is yet more 
propaganda espousing the 
wisdom of Chimnoy, but unlike 
the former record, Santana 
doesn't sink nearly as deep as 
he did before, thanks, more 
than likely, to the absence of 
the technically over-powering

For his fictional excursions

roughs frequently uses 
variations on this technique on 
his own manuscripts to create a 
fragmented, jump-cut effect. 
The Third Mind contains 
several of his short narratives 
created in this way. The tense,

Burroughs ' work are 
heightened through _ 8 brupt

Burroughs can unleash a quick 
succession of images , refer~ 
ences, vague memories that the 
reader must fill in the gaps 
between. Traditional notions of 
plot development are dispensed 
with as obsolete. Burroughs 
offers not merely bizarre 
vignettes, but a startlingly new 
way to perceive life itself. 

The Third Mind is sometimes 
very entertaining (Burroughs' 
yarns are darkly amusing as 
usual), sometimes slow and 
technical reading. But it 
consistenly has a serious point 
to make about reshaping 
language and asks probing

Teaching Should Begin With Concrete 
By Allan Mann 

RI VERSIDE - [t isn ' t 
necessary to go to the lengths 
one geology professor did when 
he took his class to Hawaii to 
show th~m how a volcano 
worked. But direct experiences 
of that sort are essential to good 
college teaching, says a 
researcher a the University of 
California, Riverside. 

Carol Tomlinson-Keasey , 
chair of UCR ' s human 
development program, says 
that although it has generally 
been believed that intellectual 
development ends at age 18, as 
many as half of college 
freshmen have not yet 
develQped the ability to deal 
exclusively in abstract theory. 

usually consider the develop-
mental level of students." 

Tomlinson-Keasey thinks 
that the demand for " rele-
vance" in course material 
during the 1960s might have 
been. an unheeded cry for 
material more in keeping with 
what students were capable of 
understanding and able to 
relate to their own experiences. 

She also suspects that much 
of the personal cflaos that 
college students experience 
may be tied to uncompleted 
development. Their tolerance 
for many ideas and values that 
are tossed at them may be 
hampered by their inex-
perience in ' sorting out many 
conflicting ideas and reaching 
conclusions. 

" People have always thought 
that college does strange things 
to students - without really 
knowing why." 

She says her own field of 
developmental psychology 
" has contributed to the notion 
that development ends at age 18 
by dealing only with the time 
between birth and ado-
lescence." She has made an 
attempt to counter that in 
VCR's human development 
major by covering the entire 
lifespan in the coursework. 

In her own teach i ng , 
Tomlinson-Keasey tries to 
encourage development of 
skills by letting her studens 
discover basic principles 
through their own experiences. 
Before dealing with theories of 

children's language develop-
ment, for example, she lets the 
students hear a toddler's early 
attempts at talking, and then 
has the students try to 
determine how the child learns. 
Only then are the theories 
discussed. 

She cites the type of program 
she helped evaluate at the 
University of Nebraska as a 
model of how to design courses 
that tak~ the students' 
developmental level into 
account, as well as help them 
develop further . That program, 
called ADAPT (Accent on 
Developing Abstract Processes 
of Thought) , stresses concrete 
., hands -on" experience , 
followed by gradual movement 
to more abstract principles. 

An economics professor in 
the ADAPT program, faced 
with the task of explaining to 
his students the principle of 
consumer price indexes, first 
sent them to various stores 
near the college to develop a 
student price index. Once they 
had experienced the process, 
they were better able to 
unders.tand the underlying 
principles. 

Tomlinson-Keasey says the 
experiment bore out her 
observations even further than 
anticipated. The first time 
around, students did not get 
brand names or sizes of 
products and were unable to 

.. make comparisons the next 
time they went out. Tomlinson-Keasey bases her 

view on evaluations of 
experimental programs in 
three midwestern univerSities, 
one of which she conducted at 
the University of Nebraska. 
Her research showed that 
courses that began with 
concrete experiences and then 
moved gradually to abstract 
theory were the most effective. 

High School Grades Devalued 
Survey of Freshmen Reveals Trends in Academics 

" If you give students just 
abstract information, " she 
says, " they really don ' t 
understand .. . and they fall on 
their faces . 00 

The issue is not one of 
intelligence, she stresses, but 
one of development. Citing the 
work of psychologist Jean 
Piaget, she says refinements in 
the thinking process are being 
made continually from birth. 
Often , for a variety of reasons, 
these refinements take longer 
in some students than in others. 

Even high school grades good 
enough to qualify for university 
admission are no guarantee a 
student has developed 
analytical thinking skills, sbe 
says, because those skills are 
not pften put to the test in high 
schOol. 

The frequent result in college 
is that ': a professor gives what 
he thinks is a marvelous 
analysis of an issue and gets 
bac~ very simplistic responses. 
This is a sure sign that the 
students were not prepared to 
be analytical." she says. 

"College teachers have never 
worried so much about how 
you teach as what you teach," 
she says. " Faculty do not 
disregard the students ' 
problems; they just do- not 

MOVIE: 

LOS ANGELES - Grade inflation in u.s. high schools continues to 
increase, and secondary school grades of this year's college 
freshmen a(e higher than those of any previous entering class, 
according to the thirteenth annual survey of entering freshmen 
conducted by the University of California at Los Angeles and the 
American Council on Education. 

Among the 1978 college freshmen , nearly one in four (23.3%) 
earned an A average in high school, compared with 19.7 percent of 
last year's freshmen and only 12.5 percent of the class entering in 
1969. Students with C averages in high school account for only 17.6 
percent of today's freshmen, compared with 32 .5 percent in 1969. 

" When these grade increases are considered in light of declining 
scores on college admissions tests , it seems clear that the 
'secondary schools' grading standards have been steadily 
declining since the late 1960s," says UCLA Professor Alexander 
W. Astin, director of the survey. Dr. Astin's conclusion Is 
supported by the majority of freshmen themselves: 63.7 percent 

. (compared with 61.0 last year and 57.7 the year before) agree with 
the statement that "grading In the high schools has become too 
easy." 

"Grade innation,in the high schools also seems to have affected 
the students' academic expectations in college, " says-Astin. When 
asked about their chances of getting at least a B average In 
college, 41.4 percent (compared with only 23.6% in 1971) said their 
chances are "very good." Fully 11.4 percent of the 1978 freshmen 
(compared with only 3.7 % in 1968) expect to graduate with honors. 

The 1971lUrvey is based on questionnaires completed by 219,641 
new freshmen in a national sample of 566 entering two- and four-
year colleges and universities. Of these, 187,603 questionnaires 
from 383 institutions were used to compute national norms, which 
were statistically administered to represent the nation's total of 
approximately 1.68 million full-time freshmen. In the 13 years 
since the survey began, more than 4 million students and 1,000 
institutions have participated. 

The annual survey is part of the Cooperative Institutional 
Reaearch Program, a large-scale study of how students are 
affected by the college experience. Each class of entering 
freshmen Is tracked through the college years and beyond with 
periodic follow-up surveys. 

The attitudes of the new freshmen on controversial social issues 

THE LOST YEARS OF JESUS 
sponsored bV AlPHA OMEGA AlLIANCE 

show a mixture of liberal and conservative trends. Despite the 
current public clamor about reducing the size of government, 
slightly higher percentages of this year's freshmen qree that the 
federal government should be doi.,. more to discourage eneJ'l)' 
consumption (81.90/0 versus 81."0 for last year's freshmen), to 
control environmental pollution (8l.S% vel'SU8 81.20/0) and to 
protect consumers (73.1"0 versus 71.2%) . 

Su))port for busing as a means to achieve racial balance 
increased slightly between 1m and 1978 (from •. K &041.",) ,a. 
did support for legalizing abortions (from 55.7% to 5I.~) .

long distance. Only when 
Santana tackles Chico 
Hamilton's "Jim Jeanie" do 
things fall together. A neo-bop 
number in the tradition of 
Coltrante, the guitarist acquits 
hi mself nicely, substituting 
long sustained notes in places 
where any bop guitarist would 
have played qui c ksilver 
cascades, and rapid fire note 

. clumps. Though lacking the 
melodic demands for this type 
of number, the performance Is 
exciting and uncommonly 
successful for a rock musician 
trying to play jazz on it's own 
terms. Unfortunately , the 
excitement is short lived. For 
his own good, I thing Santana 
should 'stick with his 00 hit" 
group and ignore future urges 
to go solo. By himself, he hasn't 
the skill, personality , or 
charisma to buy himself a cup 
of coffee. C.

after this I ml,ht not have tried 
as hard." 

The viclory for Evert 
avenged an earHer loss to 
Fromholtz in New York and two 
others in the pa.t five months. 
On Saturday, Chris repayed 
another defeat , again two 
weeks ago in New York, by 
beating Tracy AustJn 6-1, 7-5. In 
tile other semi-final, Frornholtz 
upset Martina Navratilova 7-5, 
6-1. 

The crowd of 410t was clearly 
behind the 16-year-old Austin 

. when she took on Evert. Though 
the first set appears lopsided, 
many points were not decided 
until after 40 to 50 returns. 
Austin was able to hold her own 
in the second set, but began to 
tire and fell to Everts ' 
experience.

(C.~,....,...l) 
Frazee, who represents La JoUa, UCSD and Del Mar. He continues 
to oppoae the proposal, authored by Howard Behrman (D-Los 
Anle1ea) , the A.sembly Majority Leader. 

The bill approved by the A.aembly was different from the bill as 
orilinally submitted by Behrman in two major respects: it was 
amended to allow single families renting rooms in their home to 
continue to discriminate against students, and prohibits, as it is 
DOW written, lawyers fees from being awarded in any court cases 
the bill migbl cau •. 

AB 224 bad cleared the Assembly with no difficulty in previous 
,earl, then ran into trouble on the Senate floor. The Senate is 
regarded as the more conaervative of the two state legislative 
bocUes. 

Hewitt saYI that the Lobby did not put much local pressure on 
felillators in the Allembly before their votes, assuming that the 
bill would pall without much difficulty. 

Transit Settle ment 
(Ce~.""'''''l) 

The recent three-year 
contract agreement was made 
between union drivers and 
company officiall two weeks 
qo in wbat both lidea termed a 
"compromiae ... 

Instead of fulfilling a court: 
ordered ali»itration between 
the union and tbe transit 
company, union members met 
with company officials and 
"narrowed the iuuel down 80 
clue" that they decided to 
make a contract aettlement, 
accordina to bul un'ion Vice 
PrelideDt Gordon.Hali. 

Tile contract calla for a freeze 
of drive,.' wages for the next 
elgbteen monthl with the 
poulbllity of a maximum 
incre .. of 2." percent during 
the contriIct'. term. Hall called 
the freeze a "major con-
ceuion" by the union, wbich 
had orilinally demanded an 

immediate wage hike. 
Another concession made by 

tbe union, Hall said, was an 
agreement in the c:ontract to 
hire part-time drivers up to ten 
percent of the total full-time 
work force. Although the union 
"was against it from the 
beginning," Hall remarked, 
safeguards were made in the 
contract to prevent an excess of 
part-time drivers. 

Company officials supported 
the hiring of part-time drivers 
because it "minimizes the 
amount of overtime" and could 
save the company up to $8 
million, according tb Roger 
Snoble, general manager of the 
company. 

Snoble said he was " very

Hartwell Ch·osen for Post 
Jenkel Asks to Take Over AS Communications 
David Hartwell is AS President John Jenkel's 

choice to replace the graduating Bill Friedman 
as AS Commissioner of Communications. 

Hartwell, a senior Communications major, 
was picked by Jenkel with several factors in 
mind - not getting someone who would be 
running in the upcoming AS elections (Hartwell 
is graduating) , finding someone with 
experience in Communications (besides his 
major, Hartwell has been a member of 
Friedman's Media Board) and someone who is 
able to handle the job (Jenkel describes 
Hartwell as "intelligent and knowledgeable") . 

While most of the work of this year's Media 
Board has been completed, including almost all 
of the funding for campus media, a 

controversial matter all year, Jenkel says the 
Media Board will still have to deal with some 
important issues. 

Included in those issues are subsidiary 
journal involv.ement in the election process and 
the state of KSDT finances. 

There are no clear standards now established 
as to how subsidiary journals may involve 
themselves in the campaign. AS officials are 
chiefly concerned with the new indicator, which 
has and is planning to run articles critical of 
several AS members who have decided to run 
for election. Jenkel says the paper has gotten " a 
little out of hand" in its pre-election stories. 

Also, the AS has loans to KSDT still 
outstanding.
