I UCS~ Catering 
Services Severs 
Ties With 
Charity Group 
CHARGE: Food For Thought' 
founder claims Guardian 
article sullied group's reputation 
By tvan Detventhat 
News Editor 

Jim Stephens, the founder of the UC D tu-
dent charity group Food For Thought , alleged 
Thursday that a recent news article in the Guard-
iall has so damaged the reputation of the organi-
zation that UC D Catering Services, a substan-
tial food donor in the past, is now refusing to 
give the group any more leftover food . 

tephcns' claim stems from a March 4 ar-
ticle, "Illegal Student Group Feeds Homeless," 
which incorrectly stated that Food For Thought 
was an "i llicit" student organiLation. However, 
Food For Thought IS actually a registered and 
legal UCSD student organiLallon. 

Stephens, a former ew York allorney who 
has been homeless himself, said the Guardiall 
article was very "damaging" to hi group. 

" CS D atering called and said they were 
not going to give us food any more," Stephens 
said. "The [March 41 article has directly im-
pacted our charity .... We have been substan-
tially affected." 

Stephens said he receive between $5,000 
and $10,000 in leftover food from UCSD Cater-
ing Services each year. 

While UCSDCatering Servicesofliclal said 
they will stop giving food to Stephens' charity, 
they would neither confirm nor deny that their 
decision came as a result of th Guardian ar-
ticle. 

''I'm getting more information about the 
food groups [to whom we donate1 , anti until then 
I won't be giving [Food For Thought] food for 
awhile," UCSD Catering Manager Juli a 
Engstrom said. Engstrom added that an investi-
gation into the groups that receive food from 
UCSD, as well as liability issues surrounding 
food donation itself began several weeks prior 
to the publishing of the Guardian article. 

Engstrom could not verify the value ofUCSD 
Catering Services' annual food donations to 
Food For Though\. 

Every Thursday afternoon, Food ForThought 
sets upa feeding line in Balboa Park todi tribute 
food to San Diego's homeless. While the orga-
nization is a registered student group at UCSD,

Surfer Injured in Weekend .Contest 
SEIZURE: William 
Nestingen remains in 
critical condition 
By Teny Lew 
Associate News Editor 

Disaster struck at Black 's 
Beach on Saturday when a surfer 
lost consciousness after appear-
ing to suffer a seizure. The surfer 
was pulled from the water and 
transported to Scripps Memorial 
Hospital in La Jolla. where he 
remained as of Sunday evening. 

William Nestingen, a local 
lawyer, was participating in the 
senior division of the Sundt Me-
morial Open, a charity surf com-
petition co-sponsored by the 
UCSD recreation department. 

Nestingen was apparently on 
his way into the water for his 
event at approximately II a.m., 
when he suffered the seizure. 
Witnesses said he wa 20 to 30 
feet away from the shore in ap-
proximately five-foot-deep wa-
ter. 

''The person in the contest that 
was surfing right next to him had 
just introduced himself. .. he 
turned around, looked back and 
[Nestingen] was headfirst, uncon-
scious in the water," said UCSD 
Club Sports Director Scott 
Berndes, one of the co-directors 
of the event. 

Lieutenant Brant Bass of the 
San Diego City Lifeguard Ser-
vice said that Nestingen was un-
derwater for "a minute or so." 

"He was doing just fine, but 

the next thing I know is that some-
one saw him face down in the 
water," Bass said. 

Nestingen ' s fellow surfers im-
mediately went to help him. 

"I heard another guy scream," 
surfer Chad Hodgson said. "We 
pulled him up and his face was 
completely blue . We had him up 
on the [surf] board and we were 
doing mouth-to-mouth, and he 
started breath-

"They were able to stabilize 

him until emergency vehicles 
could tak.e him to the hospital," 
Bechtol said. 

Although Scripps officials 
would not release any informa-
tion, a nursing supervisor who 
wished to remain anonymous said 
that Nestingen was in "critical, 
but stable condition."·

Hodgson 
said Nestingen 
had a weak 
pulse when his 
rescuers got him

which point 
Nestingen

others per -

took the lifeguards 10 minutes to 
get here, and in the meantime we 
got him up on the beach , got him 
out of the water, put him on one 
of these tables and started pound -

Berndes said 216 people par-
ti cipated in the competition this 
year, compared to 120 last year, 
and an unknown number of spec-
tators also made the trek to the 
beach . 

" B lack's is usually pretty mel -

Jews. Protestants, atheists. 
Republicans and Demo-
crats are all represented 
in the Greek system. 

Many may wonder why 
such a diverse array of 

people would belong to Greek organi -
zat ions, but the fundamental reason for 
joining a fraternity or sorority is the 
same as the fundamental reason for 
attending UCSD - opportunity. 

Just as the university provides 
students with a means to enrich 
their academic·lives. the Greek sys-
tem allows students to improve their 
social lives through organized events. 
One ~~ed not join the Greek system 
to lind social interaction, and it is not 
necessary to attend an institution of 
higher learning to master academic 
concepts. However, few would dis-
pute Ike ract that universities pro-
vide students with beller opportu-
nities than are provided through in-
dividual study. Similarly, Greek or-
ganizations make it easier for stu -
dents to participate in all aspects 
of college Ii fe. 

Each chapter provides stu-
dents with opportunities in 
leadership, sports, community 
service. social activities, academ-
ics and networking, with each house 
focusing on a specific area. Of course, 
a person can achieve all of these things 
on his or her own. However. by joining a 
fraternity or sorority, an individual has much 
greater access to organized activities. 

Though the motives behind enrolling in a uni -
versity and rushing a fraternity are quite similar, 
those who join fraternilies and sororities tend to be 
criticized far more often for their opportunism. 
Critic. of the Greek system often cite it as exclu-
sive because each fraternity and sorority chapter 
maintains a set of standards which determine 
whether a given person can be initiated into the 
chapter. Considering that many of these critics at-
tend UCSD - an institution which mainlains aid 
of standards which determines wtlether someone 
is admitted into the universtity - they practice the 
very "elitism" they preach against.

Mindless 
Sycophants In a 

Valueless System 
he e)(istence of the Greek system 
as a social resource testifies to the 
social ineptitude of its ranks . Its 
philanthropic dimension - de-
signed to put a friendly face on so-

rorities and fraternities - means little 
to most individuals who join. The de-
luded people who enter the Greek sys-
tem often sign their precious college 
years away in order to indulge their 

whimsies within the nonjudgmental company of the 
similarly depraved. 

This is especially true at UCSD, where the un-
corked fun of the college experience is - to the 
dismay of most - absolutely none)(istent. Many 
freshmen spend their first few days here milling 
around these lackluster environs until sheer bore-
dom drives them to the desperate act of going 
Greek. 

Fraternities act as an escort service for the ar-
chetypal,lewd college guy - the type who is sadly 
indifferent to people worthy of his company, but 
who only deigns to acquire camaraderie through 
the Greek circuit. Similarly, we have the co-depen-
dent bonding found in high concentrations among 
those celebrated sisters-i n-waiting. the sorority 
women. The naIve psychology of romance which 
they take with them into their post-college friend-
ships and marriages is its own recipe for disaster. 
There must be some statistic correlating Greek ac-
tivity with the divorce rate. 

What could cause so many university students 
in this world to be in such a state of arrested social 
development? To them, the idea of not having 
friends-on-tap is so frightening they are willing to 
do whatever it takes to get them - even if it means 
publicly decrying their dependency on the group 
by festooning themselves in Greek paraphernalia . . 

On the other hand, from a sympathetic point 
of view. it may seem a bit unnecessary to attack 
such well-intentioned institutions. After all, they 

keep t6themselves for the most part and man-
age to provide a number of social and phil-

anthropic services to many within the 
university community. 

Never mind the proudly demean-
ing nature of their initiation prac-
tices. Never mind the oppressive at-
mosphere of sycophancy that they 

embrace and encourage. And 
just ignore the way they act 

like cattle which herd them-
selves into the self-effacing 
scenes favoring image, 
reputation, randomly con-

trived notions of brotherhood 
and sisterhood and arbitrary se-

lection standards - all this over 
the sublime ideal of real friend-

ships. 
A dissection of the whole organ-

ism reveals its essential flaw : the 
practice of creating social situations 

for the e)(press purpose of providing 
social interaction. The Greeks' flawed ap-

proach to social interaction inverts the process 
by which somebody forms a relationship. A healthy 
process of bridge-building entails meeting people 
on a need-only basis - the opposite of the Greek 
approach. 

An organization should form under a common 
value system, with individuals congregating under 
a particular organization depending on the values 
they hold fast. The typical byproduct of interac-
tion within the organization is a sort of social bo-
nus; each memher is working with peopk who

COMMENTARY: The administration operates within compliance of the ADA on paper, but when it cut funding to 
the Office for Students with Disabilities, it basically withdrew support from those who need it the most 

UCSD HAS ABANDONED THE DISABLED" 
By Anna AItIaen 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

"The University of California, in 
co mpliance with the Americans 
with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 
1990, does not discrimmate on the 
basis of disability in any of its poli-
cies. procedures or practices. This 
nondiscrimination policy covers 
admission, access and treatment in 
University programs and activities. 
and application for or treatment in 
University employment." 

Although the ADA is still printed 
in all UCSD applications and cata-
logs, prospective disabled students 
should seriously reconsider apply-
ing to this university in the future. I 
say this even though the UCSD 
nondiscrimination policy certainly 
sums to cover admission. and the 
Office for Students with Disabilities 
(OSD) es tabli shed on cam pu s 
serves more than 500 students. 

Yel when it comes to treatment 
in and access to UC D's programs 
and activities. the administration 
has forgotten about disabled stu-
dents. deciding in stead to cut back 
OSD's personnel and services. A 
clear examp le of this IS the recent 
10-percent pay-c ut for all OSD 
staff members. The cut ha forced 
the office to eliminate all non-
mandatory support services of-
fered in the past. such as transpor-
tation options or e)(am accommo-
dation, and also to rely on volun-
teers to cover all the mandatory 
core services. namely readers. typ-
ists, lab and library assistant and 
note-takers. The interpreter for the 
deaf is about the only paid service 
which is not performed by a vol-
unteer. 

One might think that the quality 
of those working in a community-
service capacity. such as helping 

disabled students on campus, would 
not suffer because the workers are 
unpaid volunteers, an employment 
status which implies that the work-
ers posses motivation as well as 
commitment. However. in a com-
petitive institution like UCSD. dis-
abled students cannot rely on stu-
dent volunteers on a regular basis 
- especially during midterms and 
finals when assistance is needed 
most. The OSD's dependency on 
volunteer students has forced it to 
cut down on services, as well as to 
lose quality and efficiency in the 
few services remaining. 

Furthermore, we all know that 
UCSD has the money to turn the 
volunteer jobs into stable. paid p0-
sitions and thus guarantee the dis-
abled community reliable services. 
The problem is not financial ; it has 
to do with changing the university 'S 
criteria and redistributing fund s 
based on actual emergency needs. 

The amount of energy and 
money the administration puts into 
construction, for example, is some-
thing even the less-alert student can 
notice. From the magnificent Li-
brary Walk to the neverending re-
shaping of parking lots and grass 
lawns, the impression students and 
visitors get is that UCSD is pouring 
money into construction projects 
everyday. For disabled students , 
however. it is a totally different 
story. The emphasis placed on the 
appearance and utility of campus 
buildings has lead to a si phoning of 
money away from "non-important 
side services"like those for disabled 
students. 

One could point out the 
administration's ethical shortcom-
ings when it constructs ugly build-
ings rather than assists human be-
ings. Nevertheless, the question 

We all know that 
UCSD has the 
money to tum the 
Yolunteer Jobs Into 
stable, paid 
positions and thus 
guarant .. the 
disabled 
community reliable 
services. The 
problem Is not 
financial; It has to 
do with changing 
the university's 
criteria and 
redistributing 
funds based on 
actual emergency 
needs. 
here has nothing to do with how 
much one agrees or disagrees with 
the university's morality. Accord-
ing to the ADA, UCSD has a legal 

. obligation to fully serve and treat 
its disabled students without ex-
ception. 

While, on paper, this university 

recognizes its duty to provide sup-
port for persons with disabilities, no 
real help has been given to those 
working on behalf of the disabled 
at the OSD. The sole exception be-
ing two temporary allocations of 
S I 00,000 and $50,000 gi ven by UC 
President Richard Atkinson to cover 
the deficit in the last two years . 

On one hand. the state allocation. 
which has not changed since 1970, 
is fixed and insufficient; on the other 
hand. the OSD serves more disabled 
students than the state or the uni-
versity realizes. Every year. more 
tudents with nonapparent disabili-

ties. such as neurological, emotional 
and learning disabilities. are ac-
cepted; but many of them choose 
not to disclo e their disabi lity fear-
ing that they will be denied accep-
tance. 

As a result, the OSD finds it very 
difficult to estimate how many stu-
dents will need help, and it has been 
forced to send students with learn-
ing disabilities to OASIS. Needless 
to say, these students are being sent 
back because OASIS has suffered 
similar cuts and cannot even ad-
equately serve the students on cam-
pus without disabilities. 

Sadly. UCSD seem to be behind 
ot her UC ca mpuses both in the 
quantity and quality qf services pro-
vided to its disabled community. For 
example, while all the other UC in-
stitutions have a Learning Disabil-
ity Specialist available full time, 
UCSD's can only be utilized for a 
mere four hours a week. At UC 
Davis. book enlargements for the 
visually impaired are free, while al-
ternative inner-campus transporta-
tion is being implemented at UC 
Irvine and Davis. Even schools like 
San Diego State and Southwestern 
College, which receive less money 

per disabled student from the state 
than UCSD, actually serve their stu-
dents better. 

Disabled students do cost money. 
but lhey have the right to be fully 
and satisfactorily treated by the uni-
versilY which accepted them, with 
or without knowledge of their dis-
abilities. If UCSD is not willing 10 
fulfill the ADA properly. the univer-
si ty should warn prospective dis-
abled students by printing on the ap-
plication form that disclosing one's 
disabi Iity is mandatory because 
non-disclosed disabilities will not 
be taken into consideration if the 
student is finally accepted. 

In the meantime. the universi ty 
has bOlh the moral and legal obli -
gation to find a solution to beller 
serve its disabled community. The 
ad mini stration, unfortunately, is 
playing deaf and leaving all respon-
sibi lities to the two remaining full -
time employees and the few volun-
teers which sti ll work for the OSD. 
It seems the administration is rely-
ing on the fact that these dedicated 
individuals, because of the critical 
nature of their servil.:c. , wi" never 
say "no" to a student who need 
help, cven if that mcans that the 
same person will have to take four 
jobs. 

Because it is unknown how long 
it might take the administrallon to 
olve the problem, students un-

happy with the situation should con-
sider Slopping by OSD to learn 
about its volunteer opportunities. If 
worse comes to worst. according to 
the nondiscrimination policy this 
university apparently supports. 
"persons who believe Ihey have 
been subjected to discrimination 
have a right to file a grievance un-
der applicable UCSD Policies and 
Regulations ...

. 6 OPINION 

GREEKS: 
Continued from pc. 4 

IndiViduals are not helpless vic-
tims of the "rush ." In fact, just as 
slUdents are selective about which 
university to auend, so are they to-
ward determining which Greek or-
ganization they should "rush". It is, 
therefore, appropriate 10 say that the 
process is mutually selective. 

The Greek system is also criticized 
for charging membership dues. But 
any institution which offers a wide 
range of services, such as those found 
at UCSD, is bound to cost money. 
Insurance, operating expenses. par-
ties, dances, road trips, leadership 
conferences and sports fees are some 
of the many activities and events 
funded by fraternity and sorority 
chapter dues. While dues vary from 
chapter 10 chapter, they never amount 
to more than a few hundred dollars a 
year. Believe it or not, most UCSD 
Greeks spend more money on text-
books than on chapter dues. 

For those who cannot afford to

Continued from pc. 4 
share common tasks or goals. 

But the Greek process is a total 
subversion of building friendships . 
It effectively works to bring people 
together. not because they have any-
thing in common, but because they 
simply wish to meet one another. 
This process is equivalent to the 
common singles bar, full of people 
who just want to find anyone to es-
cape loneliness. 

So the contemporary Greek or-
ganization leaves out the most im-
portant part of socialization - the

pay the membership fees, thc chap-
ters, national organizations and 
alumni offer many different schol-
arships. These scholarships are of-
ten based upon leadership, academ-
ics. citizenship or financial need and 
can cover the cost of chapter mem-
bership. Money is available if a 
qualified applicant makes the nec-
essary effort, just as it is for the 
UCSD students who receives schol-
arships or financial aid. 

The notion that paying dues re-
sembles ''buying your friends" is as 
inaccurate as the notion that paying 
the UC regents is buying knowledge. 
The money spent on chapter dues 
helps to cover the cost of events. 
which are opportunities to meet 
people and make friends. An oppor-
tunity can become a reality only if an 
effort is made. If a Greek does not 
socialize with others, his dues will not 
magically win him friends. 

Social dynamics within the 
Greek system simply depends upon 
human nature. No rational person 
would suggest that initiation into a 

values. By socializing just for the 
sake of socializing. you basically 
reduce yourself to a degenerate per-
son, forfeiting any claim to personal 
integrity. You have basically said to 
yourself that you are not worth seek-
ing out compatriots 01 equal or 
greater value to share life with as 
friends. You've decided that it is 
easier for you to purchase social fe-
licity and bypass the necessary wort. 
required to discover people worthy 
of your friendship. 

It is a totally forced process to 
arbitrarily assign people together to 
become "brothers" or "sisters," even 
if becoming a member requires go-

The UCSD Guardian 

fraternity or sorority results in an 
instantaneous group of lifelong 
friends, brothers or sisters - there 
are no guarantees. Assuming that 
everyone within a chapter of 50 in-
dividuals will remain the best of 
friends is simply na'lve. 

However, people who share 
common interests are more likely to 
strive toward common goals. The 
types of activities and events within 
the Greek system are often socially 
oriented, providing beller opportu-
nities for making friends than sim-
ply auending classes. 

Though the Greek system is of-
ten criticized as an organization 
whose only code of ethics consists 
of instructions for beer-drinking 
games, a brief overview of what 
alumni have accomplished dis-
proves this notion. During this cen-
tury, the lIasl mlJjority of presidents, 
senators, representatives, Supreme 
Court justices and CEOs of Fortune 
500 companies have been members 
of fraternities and sororities. This 
fact is impressive. especially when 

ing through some screening process. 
What a sham the selection process 
must be. Does it select for common-
alty of values? Or does it leave to 
probabi Iity the personality makeup 
of the group? 

The Greek system stand up for 
one ideal - socialiZing - which 
is not a value in itself, but a means 
of attaining the value of companion-
ship. They have taken the value out 
of soci~lizing and gone straight for 
the act of socializing itself. 

Skeptical? Just go to any Greek-
sponsored parly and take in the shal-
low atmosphere for one evening. It 
will make a believer out of anyone. 

one considers that less than two per-
cent of the U.S. population is in-
volved in the Greek system. 

While universities specialize in 
academic education, Greek systems 
specialize in social events and lead-
ership education. A person who takes 
full advllUge of academic, social and 
leadership oppoItUnities in college is 
an attractive candidate for employ-
ment or graduate school. Being able 
to plan an event, chair a meeting, re-
cruit accomplished individuals and 
motivate a group are some of the 
many skills that an academic educa-
tion cannot alone provide. 

Furthermore, contacts made 
within the Greek system and with 
alumni can help secure job place-
ment after college and improve 
chances of gaining promotions. 
Combining all of these opportuni-
ties is difficult to accomplish out-
side of the Greek system. 

UCSD is a relatively new univer-
sity, and our Greek system is less 
than 20 years old. California has 
always been a relatively progressive 

The system is based on the notion 
that in one part of life, anything goes 
- where one doesn't need to think, 
where fun is an end in itself, where 
no one will be watching over you 
and where you have license to coast 
through the social moments of life. 
h is no surprise that such fraterni-
ties presently flourish in a culture 
which has divorced mind- from 
body-based relationships, where 
pure social fun does not have to in-
clude meaning. 

Today's Greek reputation is 
mired in negative generalizations. If 
those who determine the nature of 
fraternities and sororities feel such

state, and the Greek systems at 
UCSD al!d other California univer-
sities have followed that lead. Many 
national and historical stereotypes 
of Greeks - such as racism, brutal 
hazing and anti-semitism - have 
neller occurred at this university. 
Personal merit is the only criterion 
upon which prospective members 
are evaluated. Fraternities and so-
rorities on this campus are already 
diverse in their membership, so dis-
crimination has not and will not be 
a factor in recruitment. 

Sororities and fraternities can cre-
ate wonderful opportunities for their 
members. 11 is unfortunate that more 
people do not get involved. Almost 
all of the outspoken critics of frater-
nities and sororities are not and have 
not been Greek. Their flawed criti-
cisms are usually based upon stereo-
types, conjecture and prejudice. The 
only way for anyone to find out if the 
Greek system is worthwhile is to 
check it out, instead of buying into 
the prejudiced propaganda of the 
Greek system's critics. 

notions are unfounded and wish an 
end to their infamy. much needs to 
be changed to make their organiza-
tion more value-oriented. Until 
then, my advice to those already 
inside is: Get out while you can! 

The university years are a time 
to nurture your social self, not 
smother it. Let it be understood that 
everything the contemporary Greek 
system offers comes through self-
degradation, subverting oneself to 
the group and committing oneself 
to a nameless and faceless entity 
referred to as "the frat" - which is 
really no more than the sum of its 
empty members.

COMME.NTARY: "Making of the Modern World" increases awareness of cultures and religions 

AN MMW EDUCATION DESTROYS INTOLERANCE 
By Kavlta Sadana 
Staff Writer 

This is the 1 9~Os, pu~portedly a 
del.:ade in Ameril.:a when people can 
pride themselves on acceptance and 
underslanding - a tlille of environ-
mentalists saving the earth, comput-
ers saving us effort and politica l cor-
rectness saving people fro m a cer-
tain amount of humiliat ion. Yet, as 
ou r society has hecome more ra-
cia ll y integrated, intolerance has 
resurfaced and intensified . This in-
tolerance is a disease which can only 
be cured by extensive education. 

Because one goes 10 college to 
obtain an education, the college has 
the responsibility to fulfill that pur-
pose. However. if a student studies 
only one subject and forsakes the 
broader study of humanities. he is 
not learning about one of the most 
important aspects of life - human 
relations. Simply coexisting with 
other cultures does not give us in-
sight into them. Rather. students 
must make an effort to comprehend 
that which they do not presently un-
derstand about other racial groups. 

This is not to suggest that we 
should study all aspects of every 
ethnicity. But it is necessary to under-
stand the core of a culture, which, in 
some cases, is religion. In this day and 

age, with religious wars raging around 
lhe world and individuals persecutmg 
others for their beliefs, intolerance has 
reached an all-time high. 

The root of many conflicls lies 
in mi sconceptions about ce rtain 
creeds or e thnl cities. How many 
times have we made an unwarranted 
judgment about someone based on 
his appearance or manner of SOCial 
interaction '? What one person may 
consider strange or unacceptable 
behavior, may simply be a result of 
another person 's cultural upbring-
ing. Before we pass judgement on a 
person, we must understand the 
motives behind his behavior. 

Strangely, I found the cure to the 
problem of religious intolerance in one 
of my classes. The Making of the 
Modem World (MMW) - a General 
Education requirement at Eleanor 
Roosevelt College - makes an effort 
to educate Roosevelt students about 
hannan culture by requiring them to 
read various religious texts, including 
the Bhagavad Gita of Hinduism. the 
Wisdom of Buddha, the Bible, the 
Tanakh of Judaism and the Koran of 
Islam. While these are certainly not 
all the religions in the world, the 
course at least attempts to walk its stu-
dents down the path to some sort of 
awareness.

Although the MMW sequence 
educates roughly 500 students per 
quarter, it is hardly enough to stop 
the prejudice currently e"isting on 
campus and in society. To help the 
problem at UCSD, each college 
should put forth the same effort as 
ERe. A GE which requires students 
to grasp the key religious concepts 
of several diverse cultures is far 
more instructive than one which 
forces them to master the abstract 
concepts of calculus or to learn how 

to write a research paper.

what many Jews lind important in 
life? How many Hindus have read the 
Koran and how many Muslims have 
read the Mahabarath? If more had 
read these works, they would realize 
that much of their fighting is based 
on sheer ignorance. 

Still , there arc many students 
who claim this idea is tOlally use-
less. To those who remain close-
minded, I would like to pose two 
questions: First, is it useless to be 
more tolerant? Second, is it useful 
to make misguided judgments? 

At the very least, everyone 
should make an allemptto educate 
themselves on the basics of other re-
ligions. Granted, not everyone may 
be inspired by this subject, but it 
completely encompasses our lives 
and is 100 important to ignore. 

I have dealt with many subjects I 
didn't enjoy. I found math uninspiring 
and useless. However, for 12 years I 
had to take math courses. I am not ig-
norant on the subject because I 
learned the basics. Even though not 

everyone may find learning about 
other cultures interesting, it is as nec-
essary as to our education as math and 
science. Each student should have a 
grasp on concepts which drastically 
alTect humanity. 

The most i mponunt aspect of 
MMW is that it is taught by people 
who take objecti ve viewpoints. The 
reason for teaching a class like MMW 
is not to preach the the gospel accord-
ing to Chri st. The professors obJec-
tively guide students through male-
rial which often which helps students 
comprehend other (;ultures. 

Student should not have · to be 
pan ofERC 10 have an opportunity 
to learn about such pertinent issues. 
Yet most students won ' t take the 
option unless it is required. 

The topic of religion is so sensi-
tive that people claim it would be of-
fensive if it were incorporated into a 
mandatory course. But this assump-
tion is misleading jJecause students 
have nothing to lose. The professors 
don't conspire to break one's faith -
the approach is simply a way to make 
one compassionate and open-minded. 
As Kahlil Gibran said in The Prophel, 
"If he is indeed wise, he does not bid 
you enter the house of his wisdom, 
but rather leads you to the threshold 
of your mind."

UC Regent Changes Stance on 
Financial Aid, Outreach Programs 
SWITCH: Connerly's 
office denies change in 
regent 's beliefs 
By Suketu Valahnav 
Staff Wfller 

In a recentleller to UniverSity of 
Ca lifornia President Richard 
Alklnson , UC Rege nl Ward 
Connerly revealed he IS no longer 
seeking to abolish racc-allenlivc UC 
recruitment and financial-aid pro-
gram~ 

"I have decided not 10 place on 
the ~genda of the March regents' 
meeting - or any other- the issue 
of e~panding SP-I to include out-
reach and financial assistance." 
Connerly said. 

Last month. Connerly sa id he 
might ask his fell ow regents to 
e liminate outreach programs 
which target school on the basis 
of their racia l or ethnic composi-
tions. 

On March I. he announced that 
he had withdrawn his pledge to raise 
$50,000 dollars for such programs. 
after concluding that they were based 

MR"ent Connerly, at 
this mo.ent In tillie, 
Is not r..,to 
propose a 
counterargument In 
re..,ds to rae. and 
gender-based 
outreach programs." 

- Ignatius Anyanwu 
Special Assistant to 

UC Regent Ward Connerly 
so lely on race. 

Connerl y told the Associated 
Press then that, "It may be noble. but 
it is also a violation of sense of what 
the regents want." 

Although Connerly was unavai 1-
able for comment, hi s Special As-
sistant Ignatius Anyanwu said that 
Connerly did nOl change hi s posi-
tion favoring SP-I and SP-2. 

Connerly large ly pearheaded 
last year's SP- I andSP-2 proposals, 
passed by the UC Board of Regents 
atitsJuly I 995 meeting. which ended 
affirmative-action programs in uni -

versity admissions, hiring and con-
tracting. 

"Regent COllnerly. at this mo-
ment in time, is not ready to propose 
a counterargument in regards to race-
and gender-based outreach pro-
grams." Anyanwu added. 

However, Connerly has repeat-
edly called for a shift from racial to 
socioeconomic cri teria for UC out-
reach and financia l-aid efforts. 

Anyanwu was Insistent that 
Connerly " is not wavering" and 
will maintain his stance against 
existing outreach programs which 
use race and gender as prerequi -
si tes . 

In a March 5 press release, 
Connerly attributed the sudden 
change in his perspective on such 
issues as affirmative action to hi s 
belief that the University of Cal if or-
nia is "undergoing a profou.nd cul-
tural change." 

Connerly also credits Califomia 
State Senator Hilda Solis (D-Los 
Angeles) for his newfound enthusi-
asm for outreach efforts. 

"I share her fervent support for 
oulreach." he said .

CASINO: 
Longtime UCSD 
tradition may end 
Continued from paae 1 

Dreilinger and other administra-
tors said that, following publication 
of the Feb. 8 Guardian article about 
Muir College's casino night, Cam-
pus Recreation Director Chuck 
Gormley asked Vice Chancellor of 
Srudent Affairs Joe Watson why 
individual colleges were allowed to 
hold casino nights, while the recre-
ation depanment was not. 

According to Russ, the Student 
Affairs office was nOl aware UCSD 
colleges were stili sponsoring ca-
si no nights until Gormley alleg-
edly co mplai ned. promptin g 
Watson to look into the matter. 

Gormley denied that he sparked 
the investigation, claiming that he 
was not even aware of the recent 
debate over casino nights. However, 
Gormley confirmed that his depart-
ment sponsored a campuswide ca-
sino night for over a decade, but he 
"was advised" 10 put an end to it 
about five years ago. 

The future of UCSD casino 
nights remains unclear. California 
Penal Code 319 prohibits gam-
bling. which is defined as any game 
of chance which has a reward with 
monetary value. The law applies 
even to events such as "Under the 
Big Top," which do not charge 
participants, offer donated prizes 
and give any proceeds to charity. 

The Warren casino night's raffle 
featured a vacation to Hawaii as the 
grand prize. Agui 1M said that if raffle 
tickets were given out based on at-
tendance alone, and that everyone 

.. Monday, March II, 1996 

received only one ticitct regardless 
of whedler they gambled, the event . 
would have been legal. 

However. at "Under the Big 
Top," even though everyone was 
given the same numberoffree"gam-
bling" chips. the chips were later 
exchanged for raffle tickets - giv-
ing successful gamblers a better· 
chance in the mfOe. ln addition. both 
exira chips and the raffle tickets 
could be purchased at the front door. 

Many ofUCSD'scolieges have 
been holding their own casino 
nights for quite some time. How-
ever. their legality has not been 
called 1010 questIOn unti I recently 

Russ said that although the 
law is almost never enforced. if 
just one tudent were to charge 
that a casi no night was rigged. 
the event's organize rs would be 
held legall y responsible. 

"I think it 's a good thing for the 
students, but all you need is one 
complaint-then you open up the 
whole barrel." Russ said. 

Meanwhile, Warren College 
administrators are frustrated that 
one of their most popular social 
events of the year is under fire. 

''I've been here almost four 
years, and it 's been going on since 
then," Warren Assistant Resident 
Dean Eric Rollerson said. 

Rollerson added that he knew 
of no incidents in the past in which 
the legality of casino nights had 
been called into question. 

Despite the controversy sur-
rounding casi no nights. Dreilinger 
said that Muir planned to go ahead 
and hold its "Bingo Night" be-
cause, accordi ng to Aguilar. bingo 
games may be exempt from state 
gambling laws.

FOOD: Group 
lack~ necessary city 
permits 
Continued from pace 1 
its activities are technically illegal. 

According to San Diego city or· 
dinances, individuals plan.ning pub-
lic gatherings in excess of75 people 
must first obtain a public-assembly 
permil.ln addition, state heahh-and-
safety codes mandate that any orga-
nization serving prepared food must 
adhere to the same regulations and 
licensing processes as would a res-
taurant. 

Food ForThought has never been 
able to secure a public-assembly 
permit, nor is it licensed by the state 
to se rve prepared food . 

"The provision of food to the 

hungry is important. but the manner 
in which it is being done right now 
[by Food For Thought] borders on 
enabling." City Homeless Coordi-
nator Tom Leslie said. Leslie is re-
sponsible for setting policy and seek.-
ing compliance with laws affecting 
the homeless. 

Leslie said he would not approve a 
permit for Food For Thought because 
the city has other charity groups which 
provide services legally. 

"[Stephensl knows damn well 
what he 's doing is illegal," Leslie 
said. "He is an in-your-face, 60s 
acti v ist. con f rontationaltype. That 's 
why I question what hi s motives 
are." 

"If [Stephens) kept a low profile 
and didn't keep flaunting it \0 get 
publicity, then it probably wouldn't 
be suoh a big issue." Leslie added. 

The UCSD Guardian

-AzlzAlma, 
Food For Thought President 

''There are plenty of other groups 
which feed the homeless [illegally] 
without raising a furor." 

However. members of Food For 
Thought contend that they play a 
vital role in homeless people 's lives.

''The act may be illegal. but stu-
dents have never had a problem." 
Food For Thought President and 
UCSD student Aziz Asmar said. "I 
go out there with the attitude that 
people are hungry and need food ; 
and whether ii is their rtsponsibility 
or the government's. it b a part of 
society that I need to help OUI." 

Rather than considering what his . 
group does illegally, Asmarcalled it 
"nonviolent civil disobedience." 

While Stephens admilled that "on 
its face, I'm breaking the law," he 
stressed that laws in this domain are 
"unenforceable ... 

"On the .occasions that the police 
co me out . they never arrest ." 
Stephens said. "[But] if the volume 
were turned up and it looked like 
students were jeopardizi ng their 
education or their fu ture, I would 

NEWS 9 

not have them do il." 
Leslie said that"clamping down 

on Stephens' group and others like 
it would be a "[public-relations) 
nightmare," but nonetheless. he dis-
couraged students from panicipat-
ing in Food For Thought. 

"At some point, the politics will 
become such that the police depart-
ment will be ask.ed to start vigor-
ously enforcing," Leslie said. "Right 
now. it is not politically advanta-
geous to do that." 

However, Hank Hinkley, a di -
rector of Love ' s Gi ft Hunger Relief 
Program, another charity which re-
ceives leftover food from UCSD, 
praised Stephens ' efforts. 

"Anybody would look highly on 
any organization that tries to help 
the homeless in any way ," Hinkley 
said. 



Paid Advet1leement 

Adopt-A-School: Making the Grade 
Two and a half years ago 

the National Inter fraternity 
Conference responded to 
individuals expressing these needs 
and Adopt-A-School was born. 
Three campuses in opposite parts 
of the country, Auburn University 
(Alabama), Miami University 
(Ohio), and San Diego State 
University, provided the funding 
to launch the initiative nationwide. 

The Adopt-A-School mission is 
to provide for the formation of one-
on-one relationships between 
college students and elementary 
school children. These 
relationships are intended to 
increase children's academic 
performance, attendance and self 
esteem. Volunteers also receive 
numerous benefits from their 
involvement in the local 
community. 

Initial success stories came from 
many differen't communities . Santa . 
Clara University adopted Haman 
Elementary School and in addition 
to one-on-one relationships, 
fraternity and sorority members 
met children and parents' needs by 
sponsoring a day camp during 
Haman's spring break. Miami 
University's volunteers played an 
integral role in raising proficiency 
test scores of children by more than 
100% at one of their partner 
schools. 

With stories like these, it is no 
surprise Kellogg funded Adopt-A-
School for another two years . 
Currently, as year three beginS, 
more than 180 campuses are 
,.,...~=~t:::=~_participating in the program and 

, /.""- new ideas for prOViding 
technical assistance are 
underway. 

Fourteen Adopt-A-School 
state or regional confer:ences 
were held in the '94-'95 school 
year to provide an 
opportunity for student 
coordinators from different 
campuses to share ideas and 

learn more about how to start or 
enhance their program. Campuses 
participating in Adopt-A-School 
hosted the one-day, drive-in event 
and an Adopt-A-School staff member 
was on site to facilitate discussion 
and provide further technical 
assistance. Due to the positive 
feedback from the 200 attendees, 
approximately 20 conferences will 
be offered in '9S:Q6.

The high point of the year was 
the Adopt-A-School Alternative 
Break. Twenty students from 
colleges and universities 
throughout the country came to 
Indianapolis to devote their spring 
break to children in Indianapolis 
Public School "-4. The participants 
agreed that the 40 hours they spent 
during the week forming 
relationships with teachers and 
children was definitely worth 
leaving the "fun in the sun" behind. 

"At times we felt like superstars 
walking down the hallway because 
all the kids called our names and 
wanted high fives from us! It was 
clear that our presence at the school 
made a big difference," said a 
student from Virginia 
Commonwealth University. Four 
alternative breaks will be held in 
1996, three in Indianapolis and one 
in Virginia. 

The NICs Member Services 
Consultants will playa key role 
with Adopt-A-School in the 
upcoming year by being available 
to meet with student coordinators 
during their visits. Campuses can 
also pay for a consultant to spend 
an entire day working with 
students and elementary school 
officials on Adopt-A-School. The 
consultants will be fully aware of 
the status of each program to 
effectively meet a variety of needs. 

Twenty on campuses received a 
National Adopt-A-School 
Achievement Award in the spring 
which recognized excellence in 
developing and maintaining their 
program. Each recipient received a

Starting to make a charge for 

first place, the Pi Kapa team made 
child's play of the IFC Soccer 
tournament two weeks ago to pick 
up their first victory of the year. 
After a qutck first round loss last 
year the PI Kappa did not let any of 
the teams get In there _y this year. 
The PI Kappa controlled the tone In 
an of their game. and at no time 
really being contested. In the f1nats 
they defeated a strong Sigma Nu 
team with fll'8l ha" goals off the feet 
of Joe Ly and CM. FujH; both of 
whom kicked In craning shots that 
just got by the Sigma Nu 
goalkeeper. The second ha" was 
more of a defensive stand with few 
scoring attempts for either side. 
For the PI Kapps, the play of Andy 
Ewald kept the Sigma Nu pillyers 
from getting any good shots at the 
goal. 

In hoops action , a drastically 
Improved Sigma Chi team ended 
captured the chapter's flTst victory of 
the year. The Win , 48-43 over 
Sigma Alpha EpSilon, ended their 
dynasty at four years dating back to 
'92. Leading the team in scoring 
and keeping everyone together was 
junior Chad Reese who also was 
the leading scorer for the team. 
Backing up Reese was another 

$200 scholarship to send an Adopt-
A-School coordinator to the 
Undergraduate Inter fraternity 
Institute. Coordinators also spend 
time with an Adopt-A-School staff 
member through a specially 
designed pre-conference to receive 
additional technical assistance. 

The positive feedback 
continues. An engineering major at 
Lehigh University in Pennsylvania 
decided to pursue a Master's 
Degree of Education to become an 
elementary schoOl teacher as a 
result of his volunteer experience. 
Newspapers in at least a dozen 
communities have recognized the 
fraternities and sororities for their 
contributions to the local school. It 
is now fune to document these 
successes. 

As the NIC enters its final year 
of W.K. Kellogg Fou;\dation 
funding for Adopt-A-School, it is 
time to look at where Adopt-A-
School is going and where it has 
been. Approximately 10 campuses 
will be selected to participate in 
complete evaluation with their 
partner elementary school. 

Internal reporting fronn 
campuses has identified that more 
than 10,000 school children are 
involved with Adopt-A-School. 

Adopt-A-School has grown to 
become a quality, hands-on service 
program that fraternity and 
sorority members have 
spearheaded nationwide. They are 
serving as role models to young 
children and becoming more 
connected to the local community.

Junior, Craig Sindlct. who played 
tough defense the entire game 
against the SAE center. It was 
SlndlcI'. big frea throws down the 
stretch that the put the game out of 
reach for SAE. The game was 
close the entire way as neither 
team had more than a six point 
lead. SAE started the second half 
leading by five, an advantage that 
was quickly erased by Sigma Chi. 
With ten minutes to go in the game, 
SAE had rebuilt their lead, but then 
.tarted to go cold from the free 
throw Hne, which ultimately led to 
their demise . 

With the win, Sigma Chi moves 
back into first place for the Sports 
Banner race after dropping to third 
following the Soccer tournament. 
They hold a 22 point lead over the 
Pi Kapps who moved up the 
ran kings with their soccer win and a 
semifinal finish In Basketball. 
Rounding out the top five are Beta

NetDay, "I jumped on Ihe band-
wagon." 

However, both Naughton and 
UES Principal Pal Dibos had some 
criticism for NetDay organizers re-
garding what they perceived as a 
lack of adequate notification. 

"Feb. 14 was the first time that we 
got any nOli fication of [NetDay J, and 
unfortunately, that's a very shon turn-

ticipants gave 
many different 
reasons for vol-
unteering, but 
most cited a de-
si re to get as 
many kids as 
possible on the 
Internet.

Thursday," Naughton said. 

However, hort notice did not 
top denti st Ron Selis from helping 

wire UES . Seli s, a family friend of 
Naughton 's on vacation from Or-
egon, offered to help after hearing 
Naughton "on the phone to a talk 
show, pleading for more help on 

this project." 
"I know nothing 

about computers," 
Selis said. "But I like 
the fact that an effon

UES has a three-

The Stuart 
Collection lends a 
touch of whimsy to 
to UCSO's stodgy 

atmosphere 

t is early in the morning - earlier thlin you should 
have to be awake, let alone out in the cold walking 
to class. The path leads you from the Price Center 
into a thick grove of eucalyptus trees which lie 
behind Student Health Services and up the hill 

toward the Facul.y Club. Your goal is AP&M and your 8 
a.m. math class. You are alone, because you are late -

again. Suddenly, from somewhere in the grove, not too far 
away, strange music floats through the early morning mi st. 

You look around. There is nothing to speak of, asidc from th .! 
eucalyptus trees which make up the "Enchanted Grove_" 

Upon closer Inspection, however, the source of these strange 
emanations appl:ars to come from two, lead-plated trees . One is 

si nging, while another is reciling poetry. 
This is stranger than deri vati ves. This is,,, art. 
Chances are, you ' ve seen strange sights similar to Terry Allen 's 

Trees around campus; you've marveled at their appearance, and you ' ve 
wondered about their purpose. Trees are only two of the many pieces 
which comprise the Stuart Collection - a group of unique, site·specif-
ic works sprinkled throughout. campus. Created by some of the most 
recognized artists of the present day , this ongoing exhibit attempts to 
enrich the cultural and intellec.ual atmosphere of UCSD. 

Often, the works are not even noticed. Several of the pieces are so 
well-integrated into the surroundings that people don't recognize them 

as art. 
Trees is one of the more curious installments of the 
collection. Constructed in 1986, the work uses 

real trees removed from other areas on campus 
which were chemically preserved and then 

covered with lead plating. 
Allen has also created a tree which 

doesn'ttalk or sing. Aside from the the 
Trees in the grove, there is also the 
enigmatic Silent Tree, which resides in 
front of the Geisel Library . 

See STUART, Page 14 

The "Red Shoe," 
created b~ Elizabeth 
Murray, Is the newest 

addition to the Stuart 
Collection, which 

consists of 13 site-
specific works found all 

over campus. Created by 
Intematlonally recognlzeCI 
artists, the collection seeks 
to enrich the UCSD campus.

STUART: An 
eclectic assortment 
Continued from pac. 13 

Rumors abound that this 
exhibit is a protest on behalf of 
the hundreds of trees which were 
cut down to make way for new 
university buildings, as well as 
the lumber used to make paper for 
books. The anist did not mention 
either as a motivating force , how-
ever. In a taped interview Allen 
gave shortly after the project was 
completed. he says that the uni -
versity - any university - is not 
his favorite env ~ronme nt . and he 
wanted to create a piece which 
help viewers forget manmade 

In~titutions . 
Adjace nt to the aluminum 

trees, you see what appears to be 
an enormous blue fen ce set on 
aluminum poles looming 25 feet 
above the grou nd. Not a fence 10 
keep anything in , or 10 keep any-
one out - jus!... a fence. 

It crosses above the path , 
marches through the trees. turns a 
tight angle and then soldiers off 
into various direction s. Another 
just like it resides on the other 
side of the path . The piece by 
Robert Irwin is creatively titled. 
Two Running Vio/el V Forms. and 
It was one of the Inaugural addi -
tion to the collection. 

"What I [tried) to do [wasJ 
come in tHere and do something 
thai would maybe make it a lillie 
more Interesting - a little bit 
richer - without in any way hav-
ing the object define itself," Irwin 
said. "[ ItJ si mply [becamel a part

of the forest, as if you had a good

At the lOp of the hi II, just when 
you think y() u ' re out of the 
woods , yo u run into another 
uncommon sight - namely . a 
ga ri sh, yellow . red and green 
structure which resembles an 
exotic 30-foot chicken. This piece 
is actually the infamous Sun God, 
patron aint o f the Sun God

Jenny Holzer 's Green Table, a

ment. Gems of wisdom are inter-
spersed with quips, laments, rages 
and contradictions. 

"Money creates taste," you 
read, and "Government is a bur-
den on the people." Some com-
ments evoke poetic images: "All 
things are delicately interconnect-
ed." While others are plain and 
simple: "You don't know what's 
what until you support yourself." 

Some are hopefully symbolic, 
suc\as a long exhortation about 
how to act while you are being 
tortured: ..... scream as loudly and 
with as much anguish as you can 
muster, to reconnect your torturer 
to his own humanity." Others are 
nonsensical : "The champion gig-
gles through every possibility and 
evolves singing." 

"I wanted this to be like a tat-
tooed woman, from head, to toe, 
with everything JXJssible said and 
written ," Holzer said. "I went 
through my [written] work and 
tried to do s'lmething that could 
live together , even if fighting 
from time to time." 

Marshall College is home to 
Hamilton Finlay's UNDA sculp-
ture, which sits beside the playing 
field bordering the upper apart-
ments . Consisting of a series of 
blocks made of English sand-
stone, chosen because of their 
similarity to the reddish rock for-
mations in this area, each block is 
carved with the four letters U, N, 
0 , A, and an S-like mark which 
means "transpose these letters ." 
When you do so, the blocks spell 
out UNDA, which is latin for 
u wave."

Largely consisting of rusted-out

Paik said he wanted to show how

The interactive television mon-
itors inside the building are also a 
pirt of the installation, contrasting 
the video graveyard which lies 

~cattered outside. 
Heading eaSl, Alexis Smith's 

56O-foot-long, 10-foot-wide Snake 
Path wraps its tail around a con-
crete sidewalk at the base of the 
hill leading up to Geisel Library, 
like a snake wrapped around a tree 
limb. The serpent's body passes a 
monumental granite book , on 
which is inscribed a quote from 
Mihon 's Paradil'e Lost. It then cir-
cles around a ~mall garden, which 
represents Eden . A message is 
carved on a bench at the garden: 
.. ... If Ignorance IS blisq , 'tis folly to 
be wi se." 

The Snake ' s head provides a 
good vantage point from which to 
view Vices and Virtues, a pi ece

the water fountain sitting on the 
grassy island by the campus 
administration buildings, adjacent 
to the Price Center. Made out of 
polished stone, the fountain is set 
up on a base as if it were a monu-
ment: 

"The design comes out of the 
50s - sort of an institutional 
water fountain design," Asher 
said. "The one that I chose comes 
from numerous water fountains 1 
saw up at UCLA." 

With this work , Asher makes a 
political statement of som ; set in 
the middle of the administration 
offices, and balanced by a mili-
tary monument at the other end of 
the island, the piece suggests the 
continuity between institutions of 
defense and tho ~e of learning .

finished stone which was set up in 
various configurations. However, 
anist Richard Fleischner says that 
the work consists of the the green 
lawns surrounding it as well. 

"I spent a lot of time before I 
knew what I was going to make 
on the site," Fleischner said . 
"What (the project does] is no 
more than punctuate or articulate 
things that I think are going on at 
the site." 

The final piece composing the 
Stuart Collection is one which not 
many people know about. Across 
the street from Stonehenge, La 
lolla Vista View looks out over 
what might have. been a beautiful 
natural selling, were it not for 
numerous commercia l develop-
ments . 

The installation is set up as a 
typical roadside scenic view : 
there is a map - in the form 01 a 
panorama in bronze - a renec-
tion of what you see when you 
look out at the view. The installa-
tion al 0 includes a telescope for 
closer examination and a picniC 
table beneath a nearby palm tree. 

The piece was origina ll y 
intended to be atop the Mandell 
Wei ss Theatre. but lhe work was 
resisted when a neighbori ng resI-
dent objected to the prospect of 
see ing "LUST" up In li ght s out -
side his window. 

''The whole concept of Terrace 
was th at it would mirror the 
building ," Ferrara sa id . "The 
shape of it would be the footprint 
or the building, with grand steps 
leading up to the center."

"He did push himself tonighl." 

The upstart Riley finished with

game three.

pol. 

However. the pressure was on the 
Tritons when number-three Mihct and 
Shabel fell to the Stags, 8-5, spliuing 
the race for the doubles point, I-I. 

It all came down to Brounstein and 
Becker, who, after a challenging 
match, pulled off the win againsl 
Claremont's KaiwanChang and Darin 
Shageta, 8-6. 

"II felt good to be in a tight situa-
tion and pull through with a win," 
Becker said. 

Consequently, UCSD gained the 
doubles point and the momen[Um it 
needed to take the Stags in the second 
through fifth singles matchups. 

Despite the downfall of number-
one seed Brounstein and number-six 
Batra, Wilson, Steidlmayer, Shabel 
and Mihet all sucessfully slaughtered 
their Claremont opponents. 

Winning came easily for Wilson, 
as he defeated Kim Sparrow. 7-6, 6-3 . 
Steidl mayer followed in his footsteps, 
sending Brian Hallisey home with a 
6-0, 6-1 loss . 

Shabel dropped his opponent. 6-2 
and 6-1, and Mihet rounded out the 
victory with a 6-7, 6-3, 6-2 victory. 

'This was importanttous,"Tumer 
said. "We have won all our matches in 
the Westem division, and we jusl 
played beuerthan the day before." 

After this criLical bailie, UCSD 
headed nonh to Banana Slug country 
to take on UC Santa Cruz. ranked 
number-one in the nation. 

Proving why they are ranked at the 
top, the Banana Slugs squashed the 
Tritons, 7-0, winning all nine matches. 

"II was a good weekend,", Tumer 
said. "We started out with a bad match 
and bounced back and won the match 
we had to win, and (then we] played 
well against the top team in the nail on. 
It was a great learning experience and 
preparation for thi s week." 

This preparation will be put to 
the test today at 2p.m. when the 
Tritons take on Rochester at the 
North Courts.

The TrilOns did just that, as

"We didn ' t feel like we played

said. "We weren't up to our very 
best, but we' ll take the win in the 
college division ." 

"This will give us something to 
work on for the rest of the season," 
he added. 

The Tritons were led by Arnie 
Campbell, whose two-day total of 
153 placed him in second by a 
mere stroke to Whittier's Mitch 
Carty in the college division's in-
dividual standings. 

"Campbell played unbelievably 
well," Wydra said. "Coming down 
the stretch, he birdied [holes) 16

If it were not for a mi ssed fi ve-

have placed first; but. as Wydra 
noted, "second is [Campbell's) 
highest finish as a collegiate golfer. 
and it shows how far he's come." 

"If there's such a thing as a good 
9-0 loss, it was a good match," Head 
Coach Liz LaPlante said. "Every·

Softball Travels a Rocky Road, Losing Four TRACK: 
UCSD's women win 

By Mike Stene_ 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's softball team 
has been having trouble puuing away 
close games of late. The Tritons lost 

all four games last 
weekend ill a grueling 
road swing which 
dropped the team's 
record to 3-11 . 

Although three of 
the four contests came 

'down to the wire, lhe 
...... w.a. opener at Redlands was 
over by the third inning. 

"We go through our times where 
we have one bad inning,"Triton Head 
Coach Patricia Gerckens said . 'The 
third inning was our bad inning." 

UCSD gave up five runs in the 
bollom of the third, effectively taking 
the wind out of its sails. Redlands 
I:ruised from then on, winning, 8-1. 

UCSD then fell to the Bulldogs, 
4-3, in the nightcap, when Redlands 
scored a run in their half of lhe 
international tiebreaker. NCAA Di-
vision III softball uses the tiebreaker 
instead of the traditional ex tra in-
nings of play to conclude contests

deadlocked after seven comple(e 
innings. The rules state that each 
team starts one extra frame with the 
last bailer from the previous inning 
on second base, with no outs, to 
supposedly ensure scoring. 

Sophomore outfielder Jessica 
Plancich staned the UCSD tiebreaker 
at second base, but the Tritons missed 
the opportunity to bring her home. 

"We just couldn't execute to move 
her over," Gerckens said. 

The Tritons had been up, 2-0, until 
the sixth inning, when the Tigers tal-
lied three late runs to go ahead of 
UCSD. 

Freshman catcher Sara Snyder 
came up big with a double lo slart a 
Triton rally which was later capped 
by freshman pitcher Mary Jane 
Otto's pinch-hit RBI double. UCSD 
held the Tigers scoreless in the last 
half of the seventh inning to force 
lhe tiebreaker. 

AFterthe loss, the Tritons stayed in 
San Bernadino overnight to batlle the 
Roadrunners of Cal State San 
Bernadino (CSUSB), a Division II 
school, on Saturday. 

In the first game, the Tritons traded 

blows with the Roadrunners during 
lhe third and fifth innings. CSUSB 
came out ahead, however, as it tallied 
two runs in the fifth to the Tritons' 
one.1be score remained locked at 3-
2 for the remai nder of the contcst. 

UCSD 1ostthesecond game against 
the Roadrunners, 3-1, as it couldn't 
come up with the big hits to take 
advantage of two scoring opportuni· 
ties. The Tritons left the bases loaded 
in the fifth and seventh, but were 
unable to score either time. 

"We had our chances," Gerckens 
said. "We just left about eight runners 
on in the lasl game." 

The experience factor seems to be 
catching up with the young Tritons, 
but Coach Gerckens is not concerned 
with the results on paper as much as 
she is with the steady improvement 
and experience her team is showing. 

"After our first game against 
Redlands, we played great games," 
Gerckens said. "When the games corne 
down to one or two runs, that's what 
softball is all about." 

"I knew that we would go through 
(some tough times) lhis year," 
Gerckens said. "These kids ha ve never

played with one another. Some of 
them are getting used to a new system 
and playing out of position." 

Sophomore left-fielder Heather 
Menz.el, who Gerckens said "had not 
played in the outfield since she was a 
little girl," showed flashes of bril-
liance during the road trip. 

"(Menzel] made a diving catch in 
the Redlands game lhat was unbeliev-
able," Gerckens said. "It was picture 
perfect." 

Menzel also showed continued 
improvement at the plate, torching the 
San Bernadino pitching staff WIth two 
deep shots that almost cleared the 
fences. Menzel had to settle for two 
ground· rule doubles but shOuld be 
encm::-::ged by the solid contact she 
made over the weekend. 

"I really believe that we are on the 
verge of a breakthrough," Gerckens 
said. "They are playing beller and 
playing with more heart. We' re ju t 
not getting the key hits when we need 
them." 

The Tritons hope to end their cur-
rent six-game skid on Wednesday 
night, when they hOSl Whittier Col-
lege at the Triton Softball Field. 

Continued from pele 22 
of 15'10", Spector nOlched a 
provisional qua I i fication , clear· 
ing 15'3". 

The hammer throw was also a 
strong suit for the men, with 
Randy Buehler(l6T I 1.25") and 
GeoffLambert (l66'S") finish· 
ing 1-2. 

A 1-2 finish was also in the 
cards for UCSD's 400-meter-
hurdles tandem of Kirlc Miller 
(first, 56.8S) and Tim Prudence 

~ (second,57.96). 
The final Tritons to top the 

field in their events were shot· 
putter Mall Seefeld (43 'I. 75") 
and miler Goss Undsey 
(4:23.45). 

Lindsey made a second strong 
showing in the 800, finishing 
second, with Rhodes Wahon 
coming in third, just over a sec· 
ond behind. 

Walton 's performance 
bodes well for UCSD, as he 
hopes to recover from recent 
health problems and qualify for 
nationals.

On a day mired in smog, the 
Triton tracuters shone at a dual 
meet withClaremont-Mudd-S<:ripps 

and Westmont on 
Saturday. The 
women,led by a solid 
group of field ath-
letes, topped their 
competition with a 
meet total of 69 
points, beating 
Westmont's 57 and 

Claremont's 55. The UCSD men 
took second place with 73 points, 13 
behind meet-winner Claremont. 

The women's day was high-
lighted by lhe action which took 
place inside the oval, rather than on 
it. HammerthrowerTara Monaghan 
was one of an impressive . array of 
field performers. Her first-place 
throw of 160' 10" was not only a 
personal record, but it secured her a 
place at the NCAA Division III 
Championships as well. 

Lisa Shepard also had a tremen-
dous day. Shepard leapt to first-
place finishes in the long jump 
( 17'6") and the triple jump 
(37'2.25"). Teammate Terri 
Paulauskas grabbed second in the 
long jump with a personal-record 
hop of 16'5". 

High jumpers Heather Winberry 
and Linda Barte.:: got into the win-
ning spirit, once again placing 1-2, 
with Winberry grabbing the top spot 
by clearing 5' 4.5" followed by 
Banee with a 5'0.5" marking. 

On the track. Kathy Li held the 
Triton banner, blazing to a first -
place finish in the 1000meler sprint 
with a time of 12.89. 

Even with these wins, UCSD 
trailed going into the final three 
events. The Tritons, however, started 
their run at victory by capturing first 
place in the 4)( 400 meter relay by a 
comfortable five seconds over

YWG-IN·A·ROW: The Tritons notched their fIrst road game at Point Lorna, 3-0, on Thursday and blew out SCC, 13-5, on Friday 
By leM Rahlml

The UCSD baseball team took 
two strides forward last week, win-
ning back-to-back games forthe first 

time this season. The 
Tritons wrapped up 
thei r first road vic-
tory on Thursday, 
!> hutling oul POint 
Lorna, 3-0. They then 
returned home on 
Friday and blew out 
Southern California 

College, 13-5 for their first home 
victory of the season. 

Senior left-hander Mike Bryant 
o.===-_ =---= __ --

stole the show against Point Lorna, 
raising his record to 2-1 for the year. 
The Triton southpaw looked to be in 
trouble early , giving up five hits in 
the first three innings and allowing 
two runners to reach third base, but 
worked out of both jams. 

Aftcrgivmg up one more hit in the 
fifth inning, he elllcd down to retire 
10 of the next II batters he faced. 
Andy DeGrasse came on in the ninth 
inning to preserve the victory and 
record his first save of the season, 
fanning the last two Crusaders. 

Bryant pitched eight and two-
thirds innings, giving up no runs, 
eight hits, one walk, while striking 

out four. 
"We didn 't have a big lead, so he 

knew that he needed to keep push-
ing hard, and he battled for us," Birk 
said. "It was a tremendous effort." 

The Tritons countered their close 
win on Thursday by blowing out the 
visiting Vanguards, 13-5, collect-
ing IS hilS along the way. Senior 
first-baseman CraigBirk led the re-
surgent offense, going 3-4 on the 
day with three RBI including two 
home-runs. 

Senior third-baseman Carl 
Abramson didn ' t do too bad either, 
racking up three hits and two 
RBI.Birk homered in the fifth with 

no one on, and blasted a curveball 
over the right-field wall in the sev-
enth with one man on. 

only went three innings, his pres-
ence on the mound gave confidence 
to his teammates. Ward, who iscom-
ing off an injury, did not pick up the 
decision, pitching under the mini-
mum five innings rule for starters. 

"It was a game that we really 
needed to play well in order to turn 
things around," Birk said. "To come 
home and beat up on a 
team like that was a 
step in the right direc-
tion. We proved that 
we co u Id actually 
dominate in a game."

After splitting a pair of hard-
fought home matches against two 
Division I opponents this week-

end - Loyola Uni-
versity of Chicago 
and Pepperdine Uni -
versity - the UCSD 
men's volleyball 
team has sent a mes-
sage to all future op-
ponents: We're 
ready to play. 

The Tritons hope to continue 
their momentum, as they head into 
the toughest part of their schedule. 

Friday night saw the Tritons 
take their first match of the year 
from a Division I rival by beating 
Loyola in four games. UCSD

showcased lis true potential by re-
spondi ng from a clo e first game 
to crush the Ramblers. With strong 
blocking and a hustling defense, 
the Tritons were able to exploit 
the inexperience of the Loyol~ 
squad and open up their own op-
tions on offense. 

With the team playing well all 
around, Head Coac h Doug 
Dannevik was able to spread out 
the hitting to keep the Ramblers 
on their heels . In the process, 
Dannevik may have found himself 
another hilling ace in the form of 
sophomore Mall Riley . 

"I think that it is easy to see 
what can happen and how good 
Matt can be when he pushes him-
self to the limit," Dannevik said, 

See WAVES, Page 17 

With just the sweep of a pen 
over his second-round scorecard, 
UCSD freshman Greg Barkdull 
could have granted the Tri- _11111!~ 

That error caused Barkdull's 
score to be raised from a 79 to an 
88 and, as it turned out, left UCSD's 

B team that very same nine 
strokes out of second place, r~:99~1 thus missing the goal that tons a 1-2 finish in the col-lege division of the 46th-

annual Southern California 
Intercollegiate Gol f Cham-
pionship last weekend. 

However, Barkdull 
made what UCSD Head 
Coach Mike Wydra tenned 
an "incredible faux pas" when he 
failed to sign his scorecard before 
dropping it into the black box 
which makes the tally official. 

"It ' s such an outrageous thing 
to have happen; it should never 
happen," Wydra explained. "But 
the way 1 look at it is, it's the kind 

the team set for itself by 
falling to fourth.
