2003 Califomia Recall Eledion

About 800 

flock to 
Muir polling 

By NIIL SPUIIS 
Senior Staff Miter 

Hundreds of voters over-
whelmed on-campus poDs on Oct. 
7 as students flocked to cast their 
baUots in California's special recall 
election. 

At times throughout the day, 
the line outside John Muir 
College'S Half Dome Lounge 
snaked out of the door and down 
the sidewalk, causing students to 
wait over an hour to vote. 

As the poUs closed at 8 p.m., 
more than 100 people were still in 
line to vote. 

Precinct Inspector Craig 
Orange announced to the crowd 
that the polling place would 
remain open for an additional 
hour to aUow those already in line 
to cast baUots. Orange pulled • 
yellow sign from the ground and 
handed it to the person at the end

3,692,786 votes with 100 percent precincts

Reactions to the dection results varied among 
students. 

"We're disappointed this attempt to bij2a the 
government succeeded," said Kate Maull, presi-
dent of the CoUege Democrats. "We're worried, 
and we have no idea what lSchwan.enegerl is 
saml to do. It's not what we need in this time of 
deficit, but we're going to stay optimistic because 
he doesn't have a full term." 

Some students who commented on the election 
were surprised by the voter turnout on campus. 

"C\earlywe're aU happy," said John Lobato, vice 
chair extemaI of the College Republicans. "It's just 
pleasant to see that so many people were ~zed. 
Ever since Arnold announced his candidacy, theres 
been such polarized reactiON, but the reality is that 
it got so many people involved, acited. ..

Two UCSD professors were 
awarded obel Prizes for their 
substantial contribution to the field 
of economic data on OCt. 8. 
Professors Emeriti Clive Granger 
and Robert Engle, long-time col-
leagues, boosted the UCSD's 
Nobel laureate coum to 15. 

13ecause of the twO professors' 
discoveries in the last twO decades, 
UCSD became an internationally-
recognized center for time-series 
econometrics, the study of data 
over a period of time. The Royal 
Swedish Academy of Sciences, who 
picks obel laureates, called their 
research "i ndispensable." 

"Their research clearly has had 
real-world applications and again 
illu trates how the University of 
California's discoveries and inno-
vations help us better understand 
our world," UC President and for-
mer UCSD Chancellor Robert C.

by Nicholas S. Aguilar, director of student 
policies and judicial affairs, prohibiting Stu-
dents from having an advocate appe2r at dis-
ciplinary hearings. 

The resolution implores the vice chan-
cellor of student affairs to indefinitely post-
pone implementation of the proposed 
changes and to involve the Student 
Regulations Revisions Committee in the 
discussion of future changes. The changes 
are currently slated to talee effect on Oct. 
14.

more concrete decisions are made by the UC 
administration to Thurgood Marshall 
College Chair Travis Silva's suggestion of 

~uing the California Legislature in order to 
assure full funding for UC growth. 

Currently, administrators and students are 
discussing the possibility of increasing stu-

adding a lottery system to the admissions 
process, among other solutions.

6(ienius' award given 
to anthro professor 

By BRYAN TSAO 
Contributing Writer 

Professor Guillermo Algal.e, 
chair of the UCSD anthropology 
department, was awarded the pres-
tigious MacArthur Fellowship on 
Oct. 5 for his groundbrealcing 
research on the development of 
early cities. The fellowship comes 
with a S500,OOO grant over the next 
five years. 

"My first reaction was that this 
is a bloody joke and this is nor a 
nice joke to do, thank you very 
much," Algaze said. "My second 
reaction was that I was expecting 
the bald guy from Candid Camera 
to walk in. 1 
mean , the guy 
[from the foun-
dation] called, 
and I said 'I'm 
busy now' [and 
hung up the 
phone] because 
[ was in the 
middle of a 
meeting. J had 
no idea this was 
happening." 

MacArthur 
Fellowships, 
also known as 

Cour1esy of ucso 
Guillermo 

A1,ue 
MacArthur 
Fellowship 

recipient 
"Genius Fellowships," are given by 
the MacArthur Foundation to 
between 20 and 25 recipients who, 
in the words of the foundation, 
"show exceptional merit and 
promise of continued creative 
work." 

Tradilionally, the award has 
gone to a wide variety of pursuits, 
with this year's recipients ranging 
From blacksmi ths to biophysicists. 

"The 24 new fellows for 2003 
are men and women between the 
ages of 22 and 63 engaged in va tly 
different areas of work." said 
Danic! J. Socolow, director of the 

MacArthur Fellows Program. 
What they share in common, 

however, is that each is highly 
focused, tenacious and creative. As 
in past years, these fellows arc not 
only very good at what they do, 
their work is distinctively bold and 
original." 

Algaze is the 13th scholar con-
nected to UCSD and the seventh 
current faculty member to win the 
award si nce 1983 . 

"The money is nice. but even 
more importantly, it was a really 
strong vote of confidence in the 
stuffl was doing," said former award 
winner Edwin Hutchins, a cognitive 
science professor. "At the time, I was 
doing stuff that wasn't in the main-
stream of my field and it was really 
important to me for the MacArthur 
Foundation to recognize what I was 
doing. It really gave me the courage 
to go forward ." 

Music professor and 2002 award 
recipient George Lewis concurred. 

"1 think that the last year has 
given me increased clarity and self-
assurance about new possibilities," 
Lewis said. "[As a result of the 
award], I find myself trying out 
more unusual ideas and moving into 
new areas." 

In recent years, A1gaze has made 
leey insights into the development 
of the world 's earliest cities in 
Mesopotamia , located where 
southern Iraq and southeastern 
Turkey are today. Through archeo-
logical work in Turleey and Iraq, he 
discovered that different cities 
influenced each other to a much 
greater degree than previously 
believed and that ancient cities bore 
many similarities to modern cities. 

"Guillermo took one of the 
first global perspectives by look-
ing at how colonialization and the

cominued from page I 

fail by such a large amount," 
Nandagopal said. 

Some, although not surprised 
with the outcome, had originally 
predicted that the margin between 
the top two candidates, 
Schwarzenegger and Bustamante, 
would be extremely close, especially 
when sexual har:a.ssment allegations 
against Schwartenegger surfaced last 
week. 

"The outcomes weren't sur-
prisi ng," history professor 
Michael Bernstein said. "Polls 
indicated that Davis would be 
recalled. The margins between 
Schwarzenegger and Bustamante 
were surprising. but generally 
spealcing, we've been anticipating 
this for a couple of weeks." 

With a campaign lasting only 
weelcs, Schwanenegger now must 
begin to work on issues ranging 

from dealing with economic prob-
lems to keeping his campaign 
promises, including repealing the 
vehicle licenSing tax. 

"He's going to inherit tough 
conditions," said Thad Kousser, 
an assistant professor of govern-
ment. "They're predicting an S8 
billion dollar shortfall and he will 
have to decide on cutting spend-
ing or raising taxes." 

Others are doubtful that the 
new governor will be able to take 
on the current problems in the 
state. Throughout his campaign, 
Schwarzenegger faced accusations 
of not having any solid plans to 
solve the budget crisis 

"His promises are so vague," 
said political science professor Gary 
Jacobson. "He says that he supports 
education, but what does that 
mean? Where is he going to get the 
money if he repeals the car tax? 

Which things will be slashed and by 
how much were issues that were 
not addressed in his campaign." 

Some are also anticipating how 
the new governor will get along 
with a sta te legislature controlled 
by Democrats. Due to high support 
for the new governor, some are 
expecting Democrats to worle with 
Schwarzenegger in finding ways to 
deal with the budget deficit. 

"The size of his victory will 
give him an initial honeymoon 
and cooperation," Kousser said. 
"It's going to be tough for him to 
ask the Republicans to raise taxes 
and for him to ask Democrats to 
slash health care." 

Bernstein agrees that the new 
governor's greatest challenge is 
dealing with the state's financial 
difficulties and finding ways to

Energy: Crisis, prices contribute to deficit

provides between 90 percent and 
95 percent of the campus' electri -
cal needs, electricity must still be 
imported during peale hours of 
consumption, and that's when 
power becomes more expensive. 

"Our deficit would have been 
about $12 million last year with-
out the co-generation plant," 
Campus Energy Manager John 
Dilliot said. 

The funds to fill the deficit were 
taken from pools of money allocat-
ed to the campus' vice chancellors. 

"The deficit, percentage-wise. 
has been shared across the cam-
pus, by each vice chancellor, and 
that has an impact to their bottom 
line and their ability to do some of 
the value-added programing or 
activities or services they would 
normally do," Matthews said. 

The budget for last year's ener-
gy tot2led S24 million. Many con-
servation strategies are being 
implemented behind the scenes in 
an effort to reduce energy cOSts. 

The campus has installed an 
automated computer sys tem 
which regulates heating, cooling 
and ventilation of buildings 
depending on the time of day 
and day of the week. 
Temperature ranges have been 
widened to use less power for 
heating and cooling. Sensors that 
automatically turn off lights have 
been installed in many buildings 
across campus. 

Conservation efforts also 
include an information campaign 
aimed at students, st2ff and faculty. 
As a part of the attempt to educate 
users, a brochure titled "Conserve 
101" was placed in many residence 

halls at the beginning of the year. 
Campus consumers are encour-
aged to unplug cell phone chargers 
when they are not in use, to turn 
off computers at night and use 
inkjet rather than laser printers. 

Turning off unnecessary light-
ing, opening refrigerators as little 
as possible and turning off appli-
ances when they are not needed top 
the list of conservation strategies. 

The campus currently pro-
duces enough electricity at the co-
generation plant to power over 
30,000 homes. It is looking to 
expand its capacity by another 3 
megawatts, or about 1,000 homes. 

With the increased demand of 
new buildings such as the Eleanor 
Roosevelt College facili ty, energy 
consumption must be kept low to 
avoid another deficit. 

"We need everybody's help."

Triton taxi provides 
valuable border serivce 
C loud 9 Shuttle, the business used for the Trit n Taxi program, 
recently decided In a new 
COntract to top making 
trip to Tijuana, Mexico, 
which could potentially 
leave many CSD tudents 
tranded 'on the Mexican 

border without a ride 
home. Triton Taxi' border 
routes have been a central 
component of the program. 
The program has been 
adverosed to new students 
and their parents during 
freshman orientation as a 
great feature offered at 
UC D. 

vVithout this feature in 
p\ace, student safety is in 
Jeopardy - many students 
who go to Tijuana are 
under 21, live on campus 
and don't have their own 
car. This leads to difficul-
ties in getting back to 
UCSD safely after an 
evening experiencing the 
TJ nightlife. 

VVhile Triton Taxi will 
continue to provide u eful 
free rides from downtown 
San Diego, Pacific Beach 
and the SDSU area to 
UC D , Tijuana remains 
the hardest destination to 
find reliable transportation. 
It is unfortunate that the 
A.S. Office of Student 

ervices signed the Cloud 9 
contract knowing it would 
mean an end to this feature 
of the program. 

If Cloud 9 will not be 
swayed and a different taxi 
com pany is needed to 
ensure the border ride, 
Commissioner of tudent 

ervices Kelly asant 
should work to switch t a 
new company as soon as 
possible. It is necessary to 
provide students with the 
assu rance of a safe ride 
home that previous classes 
have had . Paying a little 
more for a taxi service to 
cover the border is worth 
that peace of mind . 

High student voter 
turnout a good sign 

T he high voter turnout on campus may have been a 
cha nge of pace from the 
usual apathetic showings, 
but it's not entirely unex-
pected. If there were ever 
an election that de erved 
to see a lot of vote rs, the 
Oct. 7 recall was most cer-
tainly it. 

Precinct inspector Craig 
Orange estimated that 750 
ballots were cast on cam-
pus, in addition to approx-
Imately 100 absentee bal-
lots. The numbers were 
much higher than the), 
have been in the past and 
it's not hard to understand 
why. 

Media coverage was 
most likely a key factor in 
the high turnout. The recall 
was olared on late night 
Tv, constantly featured on 
the front page of newspa-
pers and in the jokes of 
every politica l pundit. This 
is in addition to the u ual 
lew of election ads, debates 

and promotions. 

The multitude of candi-
dates eager for the gover-
nor 's Job has been 
ridiculed, mocked and 
marveled over, but the oft-
ignored benefit of the 
masses of applicants i that 
for once, there really is a 
candidate for everyone. 

Just about every inch of 
the political spectrum has 
a vOice - and even though 
that made for something 
of a circus, at least it gave 
students the opportunity 
to find a candidate with 
whom they could identify. 
HOl?efully, it won't take a 
similarly bizarre election 
in 2006 to repeat the high 
turnout. 

Regardless of whom 
received student suppOrt, 
voters should be praised 
for taking part In the 
democratic process by fill -
ing out a ballot. The Oct. 7 
election was an important 
one and it's admirable to 
see tha t tuden ts recog-
nized that.

~ I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Editorial needs 

clarification 
Edicor: 

I'm writing in respol15c ro your 
Oct. 2 editorial titled 'AS. must 
exercise caution in lobbying." In 
that edi torial you state , "student 
governments must be allowed to 
spend their money on lobbying 
issues pertaining ro education a 
they see fit." But UC administra-
[Drs have sti ll nm clarified UC 
policy. 

The fact is that VC policy and 
VCSD implementing campus 
regulations as clarified by 
"University of California 

uidclines for Funding 
Registered Campus 
Organizations and Related 
Programming Activities by 
Compulsory Student Fees," 
revised and published October 26, 
1999, Section I.e. explicitly per-
mits student governments to fund 
lobbying activities on student-
related matters with compulsory 
student fees so long as students 
who object to the use of the lob-
bying activity are provided a pro 
rata refund of their fees as out-
lined in those policies and guide-
lines. 

However, the policies and the 
guidelines also make it clear that 
allocation of mandatory student 
fees ~ r direct financial support of 
a particular political party, candi -
date or election cam paign is 
Im permissible (section II.C.I.).

student governments an: official 
units of the university and as such, 
they are required to comply with 
the UC policy on neutrality in 
political matters which prohibits 
the . usc of university funds and 
other resources to support or 
oppose candidates or ballot mea-
sures such as Proposition 54. 
Thus, like the university, student 
governments may taxe positions 
on particular ballot measures, but 
may not expend student govern-
ment funds to advocate their posi-
tions. 

Clearly, the current misunder-
tandings could have been avoid-

ed by timely reference to UC 
policies and campus regulations 
and consultation with the srudent 
government advi or.

Proposition 54 
campaign misleading 

Editor: 
I 3m writing in regard to your 

article about the walkout agai n t 
Proposition S4 and the rhetoric 
of the "No on 54" campaIgn in 
general. Listening to the speech-
es at the rally and reading the lit-
erature handed Out on Library 
Walk, it has become clear that 
opponents of this propo ition 
are avoiding the real issues and 
instead, are lying directly to the 
students and citizens of 
California . They offer up the 
political red herring that 
Proposition 54 will omehow 
stop the collection of data crucial 
for the tracking of health and 
racism among the population . 
Anyone who has read this short 
piece of legislation can immedi-
ately spot the "No on 54" cam-
paign's utter disregard for the 
truth. The document stares that, 
"The Department of Fair 
Employment and Housing 
(DFEH) shall be exempt. .. law-
ful classification of medical 
research subjects and patients 
shall be exempt" from the ban on 
collecting race dna. The med-
ical exemption is quite general

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 9. 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

ERe finally receives recognition it deserves 
Post,construction campus makes for added prestige 

Evelyn Hsieh 

I t was as if I had just told her the professor had caught me cheat-ing. A look of sympathy, tinged 
with a relieved "Phew, at least it 
wasn't me" expression and an air of 
superiority and smugness that my 
fell ow freshman couldn't disguise. I 
didn 't cheat on any exam; I didn't 
get myself into any sticky situation; 
I didn't do anything. What, then, 
warranted this strange reaction? Oh 
yeah, I just told her that I was in 
Eleanor Roosevelt College. 

That was in 2001 , when ERC 
was still stigmatized and ridiculed . 
Of course, being a small frosh 
Nemo amidst a huge Adamic 
Ocean of a universi ty, how was I to 
know that ERC would elicit such 
reactions' When the UC applica-
tion was sent my way senior year 
of high school, I wanted to choose 
John Muir College, then Earl 
Warren College, then Thurgood 
Marshall College, then Roosevelt, 
and lasdy, Revelle College. 

But my advanced placement 
Biology teacher, a Revelle gradu-
ate, indoctrinated us with horror 
stories about Muir (Gasp! They are 
all druggies and drunkards! They 
don't shave! They are slackers!), 
which succeeded in turning me 
away from what is actually a very 
nice college. My fellow high school 
friends believed her and chose 
Revelle. Then there's the Revelle-
Muir rivalry - what can you do? 

As a result, I ended up choosing 
Warren first, followed by 
Roosevelt. 

Being a social science major, I 
didn't mind the prospect of 
required fine arts, foreign lan-
guage or intense writing courses. I 
suppose next to nobody chose 
Roosevelt as their first choice, so 
people that second-choiced it, like 
me, ended up with ERC as our 
college for the next four years. 

Admit Day 2001 arrived, and of 

" 

six-quarter Making of the Modern 
World sequence, contributed to a 
less-than-robust number of Stu-
dents in the college, which in filrn 
contributed to unfavorable word of 
mouth. It was a vicious cycle, and I 
didn't blame my new friend for 
looking down on me when I told 
her I was an ERC student. 

My, my, my - how the tables 
have rurned. Fast forward to fall 
2003. Now suddenly everybody 
wants to be a Roosevelt student's 

friend. Those long-
delayed, spanking-
new dorms are 
doing for ERC what 

all 365 days in 
suruny San Diego, 
it was that day 
that the sky 
decided to cry a 
river. Let me tell 
you, Camp 
Snoopy (as 
UCSDers not-so-
affectionately call 
the old ERC 
campus) does not 
look too welcom-

Now suddenly 
everybody wants to 

be a Roosevelt 
student's friend," 

blockbusters usually 
do for so-yesterday 
B-List actors' 
careers. Venture 
past the edges of 
Marshall and you 
shall stumble upon 
an Emerald City of 
sparkling dorms and 

ing when it's pouring. I was quite 
upset th.at ] had chosen this college 
and wanted to switch out immedi-
ately. My dad, tactful as he is, raised 
his hand during a presentation by 
the pruvort of all people, and asked 
how to switch Out of ERe. After I 
had crawled out from under my 
metaphoric rock, we asked some-
one with a lower profile how to 
transfer to Warren. She told us it 
would take a year to transfer out. 

Faced with no other options, I 
decided to live in the ERC-desig-
nated dorms in Revelle instead of 
the campgrounds of Eleanor 
Roosevelt. In the old days, anyone 
who was not in ERC would hardly 
even visir this campus. The rickety 
buildings, status as a relatively new 
college, along with the infamous 

all-single aparonent buildings with 
exotic new names like Kathmandu 
and Mesa Verde. High, windowed 
walkways. Abundant amenities. A 
new International House. The 
soon-to-be-opened Cafe Ventanas, 
the magnificent new dining hall 
complete with a sushi chef. 

It's enough to make a freshman 
forget any traces of homesickness 
or bitterness at being rejected 
from Berkeley, where triples are 
commonplace and the food is sup-
posedly only slightly above palat-
able. Read the ERC Web site and 
the description of the new campus 
rivals that of any posh resort. 

My fellowship and I were doing 
freshman visitations during 
Welcome Week. Amazing how 
fast people flocked to the ERC 

group, when just a year ago, hard-
ly anybody would volunteer at all. 
As a Roosevelt student that has 
never lived in Roosevelt (I lived in 
Warren Apartments my second 
year), I am nonetheless glad for 
my oft-neglected and knocked col· 
lege. It's about time ERC status 
has become less of a stigma and 
more of a source of envy. 

Add to that the recent triumph 
of winning the Golden Shoe in the 
Un-Olympics, and ERC pride has 
hit an all-time high. No longer 
will I glumly respond to "Whar 
college are you in'" or quickly use 
ERC as an excuse to complain. I, 
like many other ERC students I'm 
sure, will come out of the college 
closet and finally get to mention 
our Roosevelt status with pride. 

Roosevelt is finally getting the 
recognition it deserves. With a 
beautiful new campus comes a 
wave of refreshing college and 
school spirit that can do nothing 
but good. ERC has always been 
underestimated and underappreci-
ated. The scope of the college, 
international education and uni-
versal human rights hasn 't had as 
much attention as its run-down 
surroundings (which have been 
refurbished for the Sixth College 
kids) and enormous load of gener-
al education courses. It's likely that 
prospective freshmen will start 
choosing ERC more ofren, if JUSt 
for the dorms. That's okay, as long 
as ERC gets its spotlight. From 
Camp Snoopy to campus darling 
- smile with pride, fellow 
Roosevelt-ians. It's about time.

OPINION 5 

Letters: 
Legislature 

could fix Prop. 
54's flaws 

continued from page 4 
and in case it truly needs any fur-
ther tweaking or some vita l pro-
gram was overlooked , the propo-
sition allows the state legislature 
to vote on and extend any exemp-
tions. If there are any such techni-
cal legal problems regarding 
health services collecting racial 
data, as the anti-54 forces claim, 
then the legislature can surely 
iron them out before the law 
would even go into effect in 2005' 

T he real issue behi nd 
Proposition 54 is the ease with 
whIch the state government can 
initia te programs such as affirma-
tive action in school admissions 
and the awarding of government 
concracts. If legal and technical 
reasons do not persuade you, then 
perhaps pure logic will. T his ini-
tia ti ve has been sponsored by UC 
Regent Ward ConnerlY' who has 
spent the last 10 years fighting 
agai nst racial preferences in school 
admissions, notably chairing the 
Proposition 209 campaign eight 
years ago. What motivation would 
he, or any accomplished civic 
leader, have in preventi ng health 
institutions from collecting vital 
data that could stem the spread of 
disease? How could any politician 
think that a bill specifically aimed 
at blinding health officials would 
pass? 

Whether one supports or 
opposes this initiative, it is impera-
tive that the people of Caljfornia 
have a chance to discuss the vital

Prop. 54:

issues that this proposition brings 
to the forefront. It is my opinion 
that the "Stop 54" campaign and its 
political allies have robbed us of the 
chance to keep this important con-
versation in focus and on topic, dis-
tracting and blinding people with 
irrational worst-case health scenar-
ios and wild accusations of an 
"information ban." This legislation 
is essentia lly a referendum on racial 
preferences and it should live or die 
based on that issue alone, for if 
Propo irion 54 fails at the voting 
booth in this climate, it will not be 
a vindication of affirmative action 
or any policy of diversity, bur rather 
a modern testament to v.I. Lenin 
who observed that "a lie told often 
enough becomes the truth."

Revelle College senior 

A.S. not out of line in 
fund allocation 

Editor: 
The Guordia1l editorial [in the 

Ocr. 2 issue] encourages student 
governments to "exercise caution 
in lobbying." We fully suppOrt the 
editoria l board's assertion that "stu-
dent governments must be allowed 
to spend their money on lobbying 
issues pertaining to education as 
they see fit." 

However, we disagree with your 
conclusion that student government 
acted inappropriately when decid -
ing to allocate funds to protest 
Proposition 54, an attempt to ban 
the collection of racial data crucial 
to a myriad of health and economic 
issues in Camoruia. Further review 
of university policies would not 
have lead Associated Students to 
take a different course of action in 
protesting Proposition 54. 

The University of California's 
Office of the President's Web site 
pecifically states, "official student 

government lobbying activities on 
student·related matter may be 
funded by compulsory student fees 
available to student governments 
provided that nay student is enti -
tled to a pro rata refund." I t further 
explains that students are entitled 
to a refund if the funded activity is 
predominantly political, religious 
or ideological in nature, or if it 
supports or sponsors ballot initia-
tives. 

The Guardia1l states that 
"although it's quite neglectful of 
UC policymakers to drag their feet 
when updating policy, the blame 
docsn't re t entirely on UC author-
ities." These policies were written 
almo t four years ago, before most 
of us even entered the UC system. 
Enough rime to earn a college edu-
cation seems like ample time to 
update a Web site. 

Furthermore, the Guardian is 
incorrect in its claim that the Web 
si te has not been updated ancl we 
encourage them and the adminis-
tration of all the UC schools to 
visit www.ucop.tdu to read more 
regarding the policy we quoted 
above. 

A .. Counci l is fully within its 
rights to spend cotnpuls ry student 
fees on ballot initiatives related to 
student issues. Proposition 54 has 
numerous negative impli adons for 
students and we arc pleased rhat 
our A.S. CounCil I taking teps lO 
pro tect its on!>titllcnts.

T he last recipient of the Nobel 
Prize at UCSD was Paul Crutzen, 
who was rewarded for his work in 
chemistry in 
1995. This is 
the first time 
the university 
had two 
Nobel recipi-

the honor and am very pleased to 
share it with professor Clive 
Granger, my long-time UCSD col-
league," Engle said in an Oct. 8 
statement. "There are many stu-

dents over the years who have con-
tributed to this research." 

Granger hopes his contr ibu-
tions to economics will be applied 
practically. 

"I have developed techniques 
that can be used by central banks 
and federal reserves for forecasting 
and policy development," Granger 
stated. "I'm always hoping to make 
my research practical and useful ." 

Engle's and Granger's reception 
of the awards came as no shock to 
economics professor Valerie Ramey. 

"Many people thought they 
were high on the list of Nobel lau-
reates," Ramey said. 

Second-year economics graduate 
student Lone Christiansen echoes 
Chandlers belief that the economics 
department will be more visible. 

"[Engle and Granger) have had 
an effect on the economics depart-
ment for a long time," she said.

ture change," Tom Levy, a pro-
fessor of anthropology and juda-
ic studies, said. "In many 
respects, over the past decade, 
Guillermo's work has helped to 
set a major part of the agenda for 
exploring the rise of the earliest 
civilizations. " 

Despite winning the award, 
Algaze insists that others deserved 
the award more. 

"Deep down, I really think 
there are some people more capa-
ble - at least in my field I know a 
few more capable people - that 
should have gotten it instead of 

me," he said. 
In addition to doing research, 

Algaze's enthusiasm for his work 
has also infected many UCS D 
students over the decade he has 
taught here. 

Sixth College freshman 
Geoffrey Gregory, a member of 
Al gaze 's Culture, Art and 
Technology class, described 
Algaze's teaching style as enthusi-
astic. 

"He's one of those professors 
who knows so much about the 
material that he just can't wait to 
get it out to his students," 
Gregory said . "He's also a really 
nice guy and practically begs stu-
dents to make use of office 
hours."

An earlier proposal lowe.red the 
cap for wages of new hires, a move 
that unions fear will create a salary 
gap between new and existing 
employees. Currendy, a store clerk 
may earn up to $17.90 an hour. 

The plan also set restrictions on 
company contributions to workers' 
pensions and asked employees to 
pay a portion of health insurance 
premiums for the first time. 

Companies argue that lower 
costs will help them compete with 
discount nonunion retailers like 
Wal-Man, which plans to bring its 

n~w "supercenters" to Southern 
California. 

"We are seeing a significant 
inflwt of nonunion, discount stores 

and unionized independent opera-
tors with union contract agree-
ments that provide lower wages and 
significantly fewer benefits than we 
provide," said Vons President Tom 
Keller in the Oct. 6 press release. 
"These formats pay much lower 
labor expenses than we do. This 
gives them an unfair advantage over 
other union operators." 

Sugar disagreed with the com-
panies' solution to this sirnation. 

"They paint Wal-Mart and 
Target as these horrible entities and 
say that a strike would help them, 
but 1 think they're just using that as 
a scapegoat technique," Sugar said. 

Should a strile occur, the compa-
nies say that they will continue with 
business as usual.

"It's going to be a challenge," 
Bernstein said. "He knows that he 
has to go into the legislature with a 
vision and also an olive branch. 
That's going to be tricky business." 

For some who have been fol -
lowing the day-to-day events of 
the recall, the most important 
issue that has surfaced from the 
election is its weakening effects 
on the office of the governor. 

"Anytime that you have a gov-
ernor dealing with a difficult sirna-
tion, such as fiscal problems, they 
could be subject to recall ," 
Bernstein said. "This is Pandora 's 
box. 1 would think that this would 
seriously weaken the office or chase 

away a lot of potential candidates." 
Kousser agrees that the recall 

could potentially change the way 
state politics are played out in the 
future. For now, it is uncertain 
whether the recall process will 
remain the way it is. 

"It is a weapon now that has 
been taken out of the arsenal and 
can't be put back," Kousser said. 
"I think that the election had 
everything - a Hollywood super-
star, national media attention, and 
I think the interest, dissatisfaction 
and the stake :nade it the only 
game in town."

Turnout: Muir poll extends hours 
continued from page I 

of the line, marking the last person to arrive 
before the official end of voting. 

. Earl W~rren College freslunan Jessica 
Pierson arnved too late to join the long line 
of voters. 

"I'm very disappointed," Pierson said. "I 
really wanted to vote ." 

The speed of voting was hindered by the 
fact that only two election officials were 
running the polling place in addition to the 
inspector. According to Orange, polling 
places usually employ three or four workers. 

!he ne~s of Arnold Schwarz.enegger's 
projected VIctOry over Gov. Gray Davis was 
announced to those waiting to vote by Stu-

" 

"We'll just have to be ready and hope that 
we can go on the offense in the future than 
just trying to keep things in the status quo . 
But we'll be ready for it," Nandagopal said. 

Bob Pennisi, division chief of voter ser-
vi~es at the San Diego Registrar of Voters, 
said that the countywide turnout of 64.5 per-
cent of registered voters was not a record, 
but certainly reached presidential election 
levels. 

"The interest that started from day one 
5eem~~ t? lead toward a big turnout,' 
Penrusl Said on Oct. 8. "The counting went 
well last night. No glitches. And from what 
I'm seeing statewide, it was pretty smooth." 

Orange estimated that over 750 ballots 
were cast at UCSD's only 
polling place. Another 100 or 
50 absentee ballots were 

dents shouting "Arnold the 
governator" and a trumpeter 
playing "The Star Spangled 
Banner" from Tenaya Hall. 

. "I'm feeling really patri-
OtiC because the governator 
was victorious," said Muir 
freshman Joe Shah, who 
played the national anthem 
from his fifth-floor bed-
room. "It's a great day for 
California."

"The voters or myself 
look at every ballot that is 
cast, and if there's any chad, 
we ask the voter to remove 
it,"Orange said. 

- Joe Shah, John Muir 
CoIJep freshman As the last voter left the 

polls at 9 p.m., Orange let 

date Gary Coleman to "mock the recall." 
Muir sophomore Jordan Ong felt it was 

unfair that people were turned away. 
~It's like ... taking away their constitution-

al rights," he said. "I think they should (move 
back the deadline] until midnight." 

Student interest also extended to the ini-
tiatives .. on the ballot, particularly to 
ProJl?S.lOon 54, the Classification by Race, 
Ethniclty, Color, or National Origin initia-
tlVe. The measure failed by a margin of 
almost 2-to-1.

my li~e," poll worker Kathy Orange said as 
she dls~ssembled the portable voting booths.

Promising pop-punkers spout off about drugs, hookers and gay bars

Fun pop-punk band Midtown took the 
stage at Fall Fest 00 Oct. 3 to show off its 
tunes and grooves to the UCSD crowd. But 
there were still a few pressing issues. Like, 

~ho rt611J. sang that "Real WorldIRoad

and found out what reiilly goes on io new 
up-tnd-coming bands. 

G.. ... : People haft compared you to 
bands like Jimmy Eat World and Blink 182 
and that whole genre. How do you guys feel 
about that? 

GaM: I think just that comparison in 
itself is • problem. because I don't think 
Jimmy Eat World and Blink 182 are in the 
same genre at all. But. you lenow, I think its 
cool. 

between a band like Blink and Jimmy Eat 
World and that's definitely true of our earlier 
sruft'. 

G: What arc your biggest influences for 
your music? 

Gabe: Oh, [ don't even know who our 
influences are at the moment. 

Tyler: I think our influences now are 
drugs. Drugs and hookers. Male hookers. 
Gigolos! I mean for me, I saw this musiaaJ, 
and it took place in a gay Spanish bar and it 
was a love story. But the persons in the bar, 
they were amputated, right above the lmee. 
And they were wheeling around in these 
cartS, and they would try and get in fistfights 
with each other beaausc they were all in love 
with the same central character. But the carts 
were too largl: and they couldn't physically 
reach each other. So they would just kind of 
bump with their hands and they couldn't 
reach to fight. I think that that whole turmoil 
and inner angst works their way in people's 
minds

Underground film fest unearths banned films 
Three days of hard-hitting films aim to break Chinese stereotypes 

Iy ANNA OYUWSKA 
Staff Writer 

If "Better Luck Tomorrow" sums up your exposure to the Chinese culture, consid-er expanding your horizons and anend 
the Chinese Underground Film Festival, 
which is currently playing at Price Center. 
T he festival kicked off Oct. 8 with a recep-
tion, the first edition of films and lecture . 
But do not fret , for there arc still many del-
icacie left to experience during the twO 
remaining days of the festival. 

According to the festival's coordinator 
J irn Cheng, the event is a great way to gain 
knowledge about contemporary C hina. He 
claims that UCSD is one of the best loca-
tions for this festival because of tile strong 
cluster of tenured facul ty who have tudied 
films for a long time and the strOng acade-
mic program for students interested in con-
temporary hina. He says that this particu-
lar election of films comm nt on sensitive 
area in daily life and are nOt political, 
whi h is why the hinese government let 
them exist. Cheng feels that students will 
be "shocked" at the e lectic collectioll of 
real depictions of life in China for they are 
very different from the media ' often dis-

torted portrayal of a communist, tyrannical 
regime. 

The event is unique because it is the 
world's first festival that features a collection 
of Chinese underground films. There are 
essentially three types of movies that are 
made in China: mainstream, independent 
and underground. Mainstream films are 
made by one of China's three major film stu-
dios and are supported and funded by the 
government. Independent films are made by 
independent firms outside of the studio sys-
tem but sti ll have restrictions and time delays 
placed on them. Underground films are 
made privately without an official shooting 
permit or censorship board uppon. They 
are automatically banned in China and can 
be confiscated at any moment, which is why 
they are immediately cree ned abroad, usual-
ly at festivals. 

This particular fe rival consists entirely 
of an assortment of independent films, 
which means that the e releases have never 
been expurgated; they have never had a 
debut in hina; and they are not distrib-
uted publ i Iy. In fact, the e creening will 
most likely be your only chance to ee the e 
features. 

The ct. 9 films include: M ld 

Testament," "Box," "Fish and Elephant" 
and "Snake Boy," all of which are about 
some aspect of the daily life of homosexu-
als. On ct. 10, there will be a showing of 
"Between City and Countryside," about 
poor peasants who have to leave the coun-
trySide for the city in order to try to sup-
port their families; "Leave Me t\lone," 
about three girls who go to the city in 
search of job; "Bumming in Beijing: The 
Last Dreamers,' a documentary about five 
young artists who struggle to attain their 
dreams during the 1980s; "A Horne in the 
World" featuring the same five artists from 
"Bumming in Beijing" who, after five year , 
are now living in China, France, Italy, the 
United States and Australia ; ·Crying 
Woman," about the tragic life of a woman 
who worles as a mourner at funerals; and 
fi nally · Celenial Burial," a documentary 
that covers a Tibetan celestial burial. Panel 
discu ions and lectures are interwoven 
between the films . 

On ct. 9, the program begins at 9:30 
a.m. and run until 9 p.m. n Oct . 10, the 
program begins at the ame time, but end 
at 10:30 p.m. For a complete chedulc: and

From Avril's kid 
sisters to Jewel's ex, 
the awards have it 

covered 
By NEHA SINGH 

Staff Writer 

A great escape from monotonous campus life lies in the 13th annual San Diego Music Awards Week, 
which ends with an awards show on Oct. 
14 at Humphrie's Concens by the Bay. 

A week of music was locked off on 
Oct. 2 with various venues showcasrng 
local talent. The awards show will honor 
bands based in San Diego and boasts a 
variety of performers including: 

The Accidental Experiment, a hirly 
unknown but promising band formed by 
the unlikely alliance of ex-P.O.D. gui-
tarist Marcos Curiel, twO ex-Sprung 
Monkeys (bassist Tony Delocht and 

. drummer Ernie Longoria) and vocalist 
Pete Stewart. According to 
http://unvw.mw.com, they are "a mUSically 
adventurous group that sounds like an 
unlikely hybrid of Tool, Rush, Pink 
Floyd, Disturbed and Queensryche." 

Steve Poltz is an artist who inspIred 
a cult following from performances in 
local pubs to beer JOints and coffeehous-
es around the country. His constant and 
prohfic so ngwrrtrng, penchant for 
wacky antic, crowd-fed improvlsaoons, 
weird covers and prom-dress costumes 
makes Poltz seem a perfect candidate 
for the SDMA. Plus, he used to date 
Jewel. 

Mojo Nixon, an Diego's ano-hero, 
who once wrote a ong called "Don 
Henley 1\-1ust Die," and is now a succe -
ful, drive-tlme radJO diSC Jockey at local 
cia ic rock ' tarron KGB. HIS talent has 
been described as arguably the first post-
modern, posh\1TV-pop raconteur, and 
hIS peculrar career output ha inspIred 
anti-hipster crmc , political outsIders and 
peers to sing hl~ pral es in ways as twIst-
ed and unique as his songs. He IS bound 
to make an Impression at the awards 
show. 

The Troys is a fresh -faced sis ter act 
that Tiger Beat, Teen ogue, 

eventeen, Teen People and mtv.com 
have been raving about. Anna and 
Lind ey Troy have already been signed 
to Elektra Records and have recorded 
songs with Avril Lavigne's producers 
The Matrix. The debut album is et for 
release in October 2003 . They've got 
catchy pop songs and down-to-earth 
per onalities to go with their edgy, 
spunky image, so the odds are 31re dy 
stacked in their favor that they will 
achieve celebrity statuS oon. 

Eul Thomas is a man with inti-
mate, spirit-clearing cathar is in his 
gospel -tinged soulful ongs and find 
ways to update and personalize the 
blues tradition . This year, the local 
bluesman from teensy Pikeville, Tenn., 
is bringing a group of gospel-belting 
ladies named the Jezebel . T hey're sure 
to give the SDMA audience more [han 
they bargained for, perhaps making 
their performance the mo t memorabl e 
of the night.

Classic fairy tale is retold 
in a unique fashion 

Sleeping 'Beauty' gets a makeover 
8y JONATHAN JOSEPHSON 

Staff writer 

The Story of "Sleeping Beauty" has many incarnations. From the classic Grinun bedtime story to Disney's full-length ani-
mated feature, the story of the cursed princess 
pricked by a spinning wheel has touched chil-
dren allover the world for generations. The La 
Jolla Playhouse, in a -Iina Landau production, 
brings more "grown-up" and contemporary 
elements to this classic tale. The princess has 
identity issues, the prince is a histrionic philos-
ophy major, and the evil fairy, Constance, is 
really JUSt misunderstood. Love, loss, fuith and 
compassion tied with music and choreo-
graphed ensemble numbers combine to retell 
the story we thought we knew so well . 

Constance (Lisa Harrow), the fairy that 
cursed the princess Rose, serves as our narrator 
and guide. She quicldy meets James Oason 
Dannely), who despite an awkward appearance 
and wishy-washy personality, establishes him-
self as a princely candidate. Throughout the 
play is a common theme of fairy tales - things 
are not always what they seem. Constance has 
a story worth retelling (brilliantly played by 
Harrow) and rides the full circle of love and 
hate. James, Likewise, is put to tasks he never 
would have seen himself capable of achieving 
- being forced to fuce all odds - and is able 
to meet challenges and win what is duly his. 
Though much of this story crosses into blatant 
sentimentality, there are also several moments 
of expressed genuineness. 

As the play progresses, the third of the 
three potential protagonists are introduced: 
Rose (Kelli O'Hara), the sleeping beauty. 
Clad in angelic white, the 16-year-old 
princess immediately shows her age. Dammit, 
she wants to know what's going on! Through 
viewing her subconscious, the audjence 
watches the young woman establish her elfby 
asserting her rights not as a lady of the court, 
but as a daughter and fellow citizen. It is

REVIEW 

interesting to see this side of a fairy princess 
- a young lady who wants answers and not to 
be swept off her feet. O'Hara does a magnifi -
cent job of capturing the youthful e sence of 
the character without sacrificing her integrity 
as a justified human being. 

There is a frankness to "Beauty," a "you all 
know what this is, so JUSt hold on to your seats 
and hope for the best," feeling. Writer/director 
Tina Landau does wonders with this produc-
tion, taking an idea that had been milling about

REVIEW 

B, JESSICA LONG 
Senior Staff Writer 

San Diego Repertory Theatre is presenting the longest running play on Broadway in the last 20 years, "Proof." Thi running 
production received the Pulitzer Priu: for 
Drama in 2001 and won three Tony Award 
that sam year, including Best Play. This par-
ocular production is powerful and soulful , 
while infusing enough humor to keep it from 
becorrung overwhelming. 

"Proof" tells the story of Catherine, who 
has to deal with the death of her father, a 
fumous mathematician, for whom she cares 
for as he becomes increasingly mentally 
unstable. Following their father's death, 
Catherine's sister, Claire, wants Catherine (0 
move from Chicago to New York, fearing 
that Catherine inherited their father's insta-
bility. Meanwhile, Hal, a geeky yet lovable 
young mathematician, me to work out his 
relationship with Catherine while trying to 
determine if the mathematical proof he' 
found is the final great work of Catherine's 
father, or the first great work of Catherine's. 

The performances in this production are 
stellar and appropriate to the tone of the story. 
Danica McKellar, a graduate ofUCLAS math-
ematics program, does a wonderful job playing 
Catherine. Perhaps best mown as Winnie 
from "The Wonder Years," McKellar hines 
on stage, doing a superb job playing Catherine 
as a girl with remarkable intelligence, yet fuJi 
of doubts. Cheryl Kenan Fording gives a 
strong perfonnance as laire. atherine' is -
ter, who tries with mixed results to understand 
Catherine and deal with her own deci ion to 
remove herself from the day-to-day lives of her 
si tet and father. Fordingd a fascinating job 
of blending the uncertainry of lairc's choices 
with her overwhelming desire to help her fam-
ily. 

Francis Gerclte plays perhaps the m t 
endearing ch:lracter, making I lal seem open 
and caring while till sh wing hi intelligence 
and chann. I Ie d a mar.oelo us j b carrying

Belle and Sebastian is 
nothing if not endearing, 
and remains so with this 
album. Fans expecting the 
more skeletal arrangements 
of previous records will be 
disappointed by the exten-

which this fullness of sound 
is used adds a great new spin 
on the same melodic talent 
we've come to expect from 
this band. 

With Belle and 
Sebastian's latest, Dtar

Scottish group reestablishes 
itself as lyrically original, 
rhythmically and melodically 
catchy, and as always, 
exceedingly likable. 

The album throws off

Last week, my pregnant friend was laid off 

h-om the Sam Goody store he w rked at for 
10 year . Music stores are cI ing down left 
and right because no one buys music anymore, 
they just steal/share it from the Internet. You 
might ask, why is this happening? 

You might ask this if you worle for one of 
the major label record companies, Clear 

hannel or the Recording Industry 
iation of America, the latter currently 

responsible for filing ov r 200 lawsuits against 
illegal file harer . Surely with all the excellent 
music on mainstream radio and MTY, people 
hould be clam ring to buy new music. 

The fucr i ,even if yOll lower the new Limp

I had found, some of which) could never find 
online and didn't want to, not if 1 could own 
the record myself for a reasonable price.

loaded at any given time and I could theoreti-
cally be sued at any moment. For instlUlce, take 
the 12-year-old girl who got sued for down-

I haven't said anything that hasn't been said

'Intolerable Cruelty' 
oozes smarts and charm 

A conniving Zeta-Jones fa lls flat 
while Clooney steals the show 

Tarantino slays audiences with 'Kill Bill' 
Feisty females duke it out in first volume of B-movie epic 

Courtesy 

By EVAN McLAUGHUN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Six years have passed since Oscar-winner Quentin Tarantino last turned out a film 
and, frankly, Hollywood has never 
been as dull as it is now. Our re-
introduction to the long-jawed 
filmmaker with a penchant for vio-
lence can be best summed up in the 
first 30 seconds of his new movie, 
"Kill Bill : Volume \." 

Gaze at Clooney: George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones play adversaries 
In the game for money and love In the latest Coen Brothers produalon. 

Our story begins with lead 
actres VOla Thurman's face. 
However, the piercing blue of her 
gorgeous eyes are just another 
shade of grayscale in this black-
and-white shot that has the bomb-
shell's countenance slashed and 
bloodied as she quivers uncontrol-
lably while clinging to valuable 
breaths . Her struggling condition 
is awkwardly painful for the audi-
ence - like some UNlCEF com-
mercial gone horribly wrong. She's 
gasping and crying and waiting ro 
be put out of her misery when a 
deep male voice enters: "Do you 
find me sadistic?" By DEENA AL SHATTI 

Associate Hiatus Editor 

'I ntolerable Cruelc( began ~e 
way many romanoc comedies 
do: With an unfaithful spouse, 
a broken hean and an oppor-

tunity for new love. Many twists 
and rums later, Catherine Zeta-
Jones and George Clooney are 
engaged in a who-can-outwit-the-
other-to-achieve-the-most-money 
battle. It's a playas dream. 

Zeta-Jones plays Marilyn 
Rexroth, a conniving gold-digger 
who divorces her millionaire hus-
band. After taking him to court, 
Marilyn loses any and all clajrns she 
had, thanks to the legal brilliance 
of Miles Massey (Dooney), her ex-
husband 's lawyer. She quicldy 
recovers and soon latches her claws 
onto an oil tycoon. Suffice it to say, 
the mamage isn't what you would 
expect and the Coen brothers keep 
the audience on their toes. 11us 
certainly is nor a typical romantic 
comedy. 

""rule all the malO actors are 
talented, not all 0 them lived up to 
expectaoons. Zeta-Jones, m partic-
ular, seemed to phone-m all her 
scenes. The character of Marilyn 
didn't seem to be tOO big of a 
stretch for the actress, who natural-
ly possesses the necessary charm 
and chamma. Billy Bob Thorton 
gave an ImpressIve performance as

from Texas - a role that is hardly 
a stretch for the Arkansas actor. 
However, Clooney completely Ut 
up the screen in all of his scenes, 
being so utterly charming that 
even the popcorn swooned. 

But it was really the smaller 
performances that made the film . 
The beSt character is Wrige\y, 
Massey's co-counsel played by Paul 
Adelstein. His scenes were definite 
highlights of the film. Without 
him, the film would nor have been 
as charming as it was. 

As a whole, however, the movie 
was tOO choppy and rushed. The 
script has a few good one-liners 
and comic scenes, but didn't flow 
well. Check it ou! for the few hilar-
ious gags and obVIously, to see 
Dooney. ··Intolerable Cruelty" IS 
great to see as a matinee, but is def-
ini tely nor wonh a nme-buck 
evening show.

Rated Pe-13 

If that was you asking the ques-
tion, Mr. Tarantino, then our 
answer is a resounding "yes." And 
that's why you and your sadistic 
movies are more than welcome 
back to a Hollywood where horri-
ble plotlines are playing second fid -
dle only to seque ls with horrible 
plorlines. And while many may go 
into "Kill Bill" expecting its almost 
exclusively female cast of asskicker 
to resemble another worthless 
installment of "Charlie's Angel," 
those naysayers need to get with 
the program and remember who 
we're dealing with here. "Charlie's 
Angels" is the theatrical version of 
Maxim magazme; "Kill Bill" is a 
kung fu movie directed by a man 
whose only goal in life is to desen-
sitize his audience within minutes 
of his film, while dropping in as 
much pop culrure knowledge a 
possible. 

Taranono led the way for guys-
with-guns flICks when "Pulp 
Ficnon" achieved mainstream suc-
cess in 1995. While he created and 
saw to fruioon cult favorites "True 
Romance" and "Reservoir Dogs" 
beforehand, it was "Pulp Fiction" 
where Tarantino, with his unique 
storyboards, interesting characters 
and over-the-top violence, gained 
widespread fame. 

However, "Kill Bill" is a depar-
rure from these rypes of movies in 
ome respects. Tarantino ditche

Film 
REVIEW 

his much-mimicked guys-with-
guns subgenre and borrows a page 
from contemporary times, embrac-
ing martial arts to drive the action 
in the vein of popular films like 
"The Matrix," "X-Men" and any-
thing with Jackie Chan in it. T he 
"creative dialogue" he uses in his 
earlier movies, where ordinary pop 
culture like Big Macs, Pam Greer 
and Madonna 's "Like a Virgin" are 
thrown in on a whim, is axed. Don't 
be fooled - this is classic 
Tarantino in some respects , but it's 
primarily a kung fu movie. 

The plot takes us on the odyssey 
of The Bride, played by Thunnan, 
who was once known to her cronies 
in the Deadly Viper Assassination 
Death quad as "Black Mamba." 
After becoming pregnant and 
falling in love, The Bride skips out 
on her loyalties to her band of dead-
ly operatives run by Bill, and choos-
es the domestic life of marriage and 
motherhood. On her wedding day, 
her fo rmer brethren take the Texas 
wedding chapel hostage and kill 
everyone present. They leave The 
Bride for dead, shooting her in the 
head. 

Lo and behold, she only wmds 
up comatose and awakens four 
years later. After breaking out of 
the hospital and regrouping, she 
makes a list of the five people in the 
Deadly Viper As a sination Death 
Squad and vows revenge on every 
one. This film is essentially a story 
of The Bride crossing off name 

after name on the list. 
'''Kill Bill" is over four hours 

long uncut, so the Miramax snl-
dio allowed Tarantino to keep as 
much footage as he wanted on the 
conditi on that it was relea ed in 
two eparate volumes. This first 
volume fearures The Bride's bat-
tles with characters pla yed by 
Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu. The 
other three characters The Bride 
must pay retribution to, assuming 
she makes it through the list alive, 
will be part of the second volume, 
slated for release in February 
2004. 

But while the storyline seems a 
linear as the The Bride's list, fear 
not. Tarantino plays with the 
chronology, as is his specia lry, to 
keep it interesting and even throws 
in a 20-minute anime scene 
describing the Liu character's rise 
to power. Of cour e, it wouldn't be 
a Tarantino film without the cheesy 
ways in which he makes the charac-
ters' blood spill out during fight 
scenes, sticking to the classics (the 
fire hydraht and garden sprinkler) 
while adding a few new serrings 
(the slot machine payout, tropical 
storm and hamu splash zone). 

For the easily queased, don't 
enter tlus film and expect to keep 
your lunch down. For the desensi-
tized, don't forget the popcorn -
this movie rocks!

I _ 14 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, OCTOBER 9,2003 

Midtown: Vegetarian rockers can still party Awards: The Trays, Steve 
Poltz, and Ilya perform conrinued /rom page 9 Rob: I think it serves as a 

metaphor for the trials and tribu-
lation of lots of groups. 

Tyler: Like you 're always kind 
of butting heads but you're not ... 
you can't reach. 

Rob: For other bands in this 
genre, I think we've definitely got 
more of an East Coast fl avor, 
because we've been influenced by 
bands from there. 

Tyler: We have the fever for the 
flavor. We go into disco freakout 
on sClge. It has to do with my shirt. 

G: "The Next Jobn TrllVolta?" 
[points to the shirt) - as in 
"Grease?" 

Tyler: You know, it says a lot 
about a person with a shirt like 
this, and which movie do they 
think I'm referring to. Somebody 
in the other place said, "Does that 
mean one day you 're goi ng to get 
bloated and out of work?" And 
I'm li lt.e, "Possibly." 

G: H ow did your parents feel 
about you dropping out of 
Rutgers [University)? 

G2be: T hey weren 't cool 
about it at first, especial ly my par-
ents who were like ... "We've 
worked real hard for you to get an 
education, and now you're throw-
ing it all away." But I think once 
they realized we were serious 
about this and we weren't just 
doing this half-used . .. 

Tyler: We used the fuji ass. 
G2bc: They were more sup-

portive, especially after they see 
what we've accomplished . 

G: How did you feel about 
dropping out? Were you thrilled? 

Gabe: College wasn 't neces-
sarily '" right for everyone .. . I 
wasn 't particularly thrilled with 
college; I think we 've learned so 
much more through this. 

Rob: I mean, we've had times, 

especially when we go home and 
visit and see our friends go to col-
lege parties ... and we're like 
"Fuck! We never really had a 
chance to do any of this." 

Tyler: And then we realize 
how much better our life isl Like, 
wow, it's really cool hanging out at 
someone's house drinking from a 
keg of beer. N o, but it 's weird, 
because you grow up in a much 
different way. Even now, our 
fri ends and peers have graduated 
and have jobs, and you know, it's 
different . 

" Wow, it's really cool 
hanging out at someone's 
house drinking a keg of 

be " f?r. 
- Tyler Rann of Midtown 

G: D o you plan on going back 
at all? 

Tyler: I'm going to donate a 
library at some point, and get an 
honorary degree. 

G: So you did the "Real 
WoridlRoad Rules C hallenge" 
theme song? 

All: I don't know what you're 
talking about. 

Tyler: What happened is, 
theres this other band of guys 
who are really good-looking. I 
mean, I was surprised at how 
good-looking they are. They pull 
it off pretty well . 

Gabc: When that was happen-
ing, we were all sunbathing on the 
coast of Ibiza with spider-mon-
keys, and tripping on acid . 

G: So, what sparked your 

interest in vegetarianism and ani-
mal rights? 

Tyler: I think I can sum it aU 
up in the words of a really wise 
prophet .. , a man named Elvis 
P resley. H e said "Don't be cruel." 
And that's what we do - we avoid 
cruelty. 

G2bc: That is not true, because 
I fucking hate people. 

Tyler: Well, not the animals! 
That's the thing - it~ unneces-
sary to eat animals for survival. 

G: Who is the best band you 
have played with? 

All: J immy Eat World. 
Rob: They're so huge, and on 

top of all of it, they're really down-
to-earth guys. And on top of that, 
live - they're flawless. They're 
aggressive and chaotic, and at the 
same time just have great structure. 

Tyler: They change. They 
grow musically and at the same 
time make their audience grow 
with them , so they' ll always 
remain r elevant. That's really 
important, you know, because you 
have to change yourself to make 
music; you have to keep challeng-
ing people. Very few bands do 
that, a lot of bands just go "Oh, we 
found these hit songs, and now 
we're just going to remake it for 
the next thirty years or some-
thing." Like, look at Radiohead. 
They make an Il.lbum, and its 
called the greatest album of the 
20th century, and they go and .. . 
well, the hell with it. We're going 
to do something completely dif-
ferent. That takes balls. And I 
appreciate that as a listener 
because I want to know what 
they're up to next; I want them to 
take me to the next place. 

G: Where'd you get your name 
from? 

Tyler: My parents gave me 
mine. 

continued from page 9 
named Blanca Rojas. They sound 
similar to the Black Heart 
Procession, only with a female 
instead of a male singing lullabies 
instead of funeral dirges. They are 
relatively new to San Diego, but 
not unnoticed - their appearance 
at this year's awards ceremony 
comes a year after their nomina-
tion for Best New Artist at the 
2002 SOMA. 

SOMA proceeds have always 
gone towards purchasing instru-
ments for elementary schools in 
San Diego. Over the years , this 
has allowed school districts to buy 
the less expensive instruments 
like flutes , clarinets and violins. 
Recently, though, the focus has 
changed: The SOMA Foundation 
has teamed with San Diego 

CityBEAT and EI Cajon's Taylor 
Guitars to create a unique, new 
fundraising program simply 
called "Taylor Guitars fo r 
Schools. " To date, there are five 
active schools in the guitar pro-
gram, and a financial commit-
ment to add programs at TWO 
additional schools during the fall . 
In spring 2004, funding becomes 
avai lable to add five new schools. 
The SOMA will give schools thar 
enter the program "Baby" Taylor 
guitars and provide guitar 
instruction. Fundraising for this 
program is essential , so buy 
SOMA tickets soon and be pre-
pared for an entertaining and 
diverse show with unique San 
Diego performers. 

The show starts at 7 p.m. and 
tickets are $15 to $20. 

Beauty: Characters are 
revamped in fun new telling 

conrin~d /rom page 10 
for years and transfonning it into a 
beautiful , haunting and touching 
piece of theater. What makes the 
work truly Oy is the ensemble. Made 
up of UCSD Masters of Fine Arts 
candidates David Ari, Corey Brill, 
Simone Vicari Moore, Adam Smith 
and Amy Stewart, the mutli-roled 
players created the somber, bitter-
sweet and then uplifting atmosphere 
that made the play work. Most 
notable are Brill, whose regal 
moments as the self-afflicted King 
Bertrand were topped only by his 
mean Oashlight work, and Ari , who 
was hysterical in his bit part as a 
1970s hipster, yet failed prince. 

Also worth mentioning is the 

scenic (Riccardo Hernandez) and 
light (Scott Zielinski) design. The 
simple tools of shadow, cunains 
and a museum of metal and other-
wise bared pieces that should be 
known as "variations on a spinning 
wheel ," provide a perfect, funky 
and storybook background 

The tight playing of the ensem-
ble, set neatly upon the shoulders 
of the leads and placed squarely in 
the foreground of some of the most 
effective "simple" sets, made for a 
lovely and powerful show. 

"Beauty" runs Tuesday through 
Sunday until Oct. 19. Call (858) 
550- 1010 for more info. Rush and 
under-30 tickets are $15, regularly 
priced tickets run 534 to $49.

Steal: Condescending writer 
tells you to keep downloading 

continued /rom page I I 
Don't look at albums you bought 
five years ago and say, "Gosh , I sure 
wish they made 'em like they used 
to." They make records just as good, 
if not better. 

I'll risk sounding righteous or 
condescending because 1 want 
everyone to hear artists like Cat 
Power and Wileo. They've released 
TWO of the best records in recent 
memory, the kind that almost any-
one can enjoy because they're not 
offensively loud o r strange bu t sti ll 

po~sess the kind of engaging individ-
uality that makes them great artists. 

But no one who went out of their 
way to find out what all dle fuss was 
about heard the music. Radio 
wouldn 't touch them, thats for sure. 
Why is a Wilcos rop-20, critically 
acclaimed album that has a major 

motion pictu re made about its 
incredible story ignored by so many 
people? 

P eople have to start li stening to 
music differently. Some already do, 
but no one has come up with a 
good way to incorporate it into the 
cur rent market. Sure, 99 cents a 
song ... how about free? Suing peo-
ple into not downloading music is 
like Prohibition; it's not going to 
stop now tha t it has started. 

Everyone is responsible. T he 
m usic is there. People have to want 
to listen, and those in charge need 
to make people want to listen 
instead of run away and shut out 
music forever. 

O ne clarification: not all main-
stream music is bad. You have no 
excuse to hate on the Strokes, hip-
sters . Their new record is dope. 

Proof: Mathematical gen ius 
is the center of this dramedy 

continued /rom page 10 
Woodhouse, who is also the di rector, 
give a strong performance as 
Robert, the fa ther. H e does an amaz-
ing job of showing the love he has 
for Catherine despite increasingly 
overwhelming mental problems. 

While well done and srupendous-
Iy performed, this production plays 
on several stereotypes and popular 
themes. One of the first things that 
comes to mind while watching this 
production is the movie "A Beautiful 
Mind," which also plays on the idea 
of math ematical genius and mental 
illness. Some of the characters also 
seem to be fa lni liar fi gures. Claire i 
the typical New Yorker in the begi n-

ning of the play, overly concerned 
with appearance and friends even in 
the face of her father~ death. The 
character of Hal is also portrayed as 
academics are often depicted, some-
what socially awkward and limited to 
university life. 

Covering such subjects as acade-
mia, mental illness and family 
dynamics, this first-rate production 
plays to audiences of all kinds, espe-
cially here at a university. The strong 
story and dynamic character interac-
tion are a must see . 

"Proor' is now playing through 
Oct. 26 at the Lyceum in Horton 
Pla7.3 . For tickets, call the box office

Tritons place in top three 
Cross country teams take second, third 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Staff Writer 

The men 's and women's 
U CSD cross country teams 
churned out impressive perfor-
mances at the Willamette Cross-
Country Invitational in Salem, 
Ore., on OCt. 4. The women fin-
ished second among 27 teams 
while the No. 19 Triton men cap-
tured a solid third-place finish out 
of 26 teams. 

"Both teams performed very 
well ," said head coach Ted Van 
Arsdale. "We were above several 
nationally-ranked teams and con-
ference favori tes .• 

Competing in the College 
D ivision, comprised of NCAA 
D ivision II, Division III and 
NAIA programs, UCSD's day was 
underscored by top-10 finishes in 
the women's race for junior 
Lindsay Stalker and freshman sen-
sation Ti na Firouz, while a 
notable four runners placed in the 
top 21 in the men's competition. 

Cal ifornia Collegiate Athletic 
Association rival Chico State pre-
vailed, winning the team titles in 
both events, with Wildcat runners 
Tyler Graff (24: 15 .97), a senior, 
and Katie Lee (17:48.29), a junior, 
winning the S,OOO-meter men's 
and 5,OOO-meter women's races, 
respectively. 

Stalker grabbed seventh place 
for the T riton women in 
18:00.95, with Firouz following 
in 10th, cru isi ng the difficult 
course in 18:06.27 . Sophomore 
Michell e DiMeo (16th , 

18:20.33), senior Kathy Read 
(18th, 18:22 .75) and sophomore 
Bailey Kennedy (25th, 18:32.33) 
were the remaining point scorers 
for UCSD, as the Tritons were 
only outdistanced by Chico State, 
42 -75 . 

Sophomores Nina Miller 
(47th, 18:47 .96), Erin O'Donnell 
(50th, ) 8:54.42), Mimi Hodgins 
(57th, )9:02 .45) and Lindsey 
Young (80th, 19:23 .99), along 
with freshman Brenda Stevens 
(83rd, 19:25.55), rounded out the 
UCSD field. 

A toral of 189 runners took 
part, with all of the 10 total 
UCSD women entered into the 
meet coming well within the top 
half of the runners. 

Senior Neil Kalra came in II th 
out of 250 competitors on the 
men's side in 24:39.39. Senior 
John Morrison (15th, 24:55 .82), 
junior Robert Eap (17th, 
24:59.97) and sophomore Carl 
Lostrom (21st, 25 :06.63) all ran 
close to him to score important 
points for UCSD. 

According to Van Arsdale, 
Kalra made the top-25 all -time 
performance list, raking the sec-
ond-best position in the record 
books with his Willamette 
Invitational performance. 

Freshman Steve Vargas was the 
other point scorer with a time of 
25:34:78, good enough for 41st 
place. 

"Vargas had an incredible time 
for a freshman,' Van Andale said. 

The ten UCSD men entered 
all came within the top quarter of 

all the total runners entered. 
The Triton men totaled 99 

points, falling behind Chico State 
with 45 and Eastern Oregon with 
58. Other UCSD athletes in the 
field included senior Julian 
Nahan (48th, 25 :45.41), sopho-
mores Chris Beetley-Hagler 
(50th , 25:48.16) and Kevin Ray 
(65th, 26:09.55), senior Richey 
Hansen (83rd, 26:24.28) and 
freshman Daniel Holligan (84th, 
26:24.56). 

"Nahan had some little strug-
gles at one point, but really 
stepped it up," Van Arsdale said. 

All races were noticeably close, 
with Chico State women's cham-
pion Lee finishing only slighdy 
more than five seconds ahead of 
the pack at 17 :48 on the five kilo-
meter course. 

The great achievement of 
UCSD at this meet was particu-
larly striking due to the fact tha t 
both Chico State squads were 
ranked No. 4 in the nation and 
No. 1 in the West Region, respec-
tively. 

"Chico State is a conference 
favorite," Van Arsdale said. 

The Tri ton cross coun try 
teams will next host the UC San 
Diego Triton Classic on Oct. II at 
the North Campus Course. The 
6,OOO-meter women's race will 
begin at 8:30 a.m., followed by the 
8,OOO-meter men's race at 9:30 
a.m. 

"Our team success is based on 
the tight team commitment, and 
we are running at championship-
quality pace." Van Arsdale said.

Men's soccer: Tritons can't 
hold onto 1 .. 0 lead at home 

continued /rom page 20 
near the left corner of the penalty 
box. From there, Shaw beat 
Coolcson with a low shot in the left 
side of the net, and the goal would 
turn out to be the last one scored in 
the 1-1 tie. 

In the two IO-minute periods of 
extra play, Davey had the best oppor-
tunity to get the Vme-winning goal 
in the first overtime for the Tritons. 
Davey took a long pass from team-
mate Luke Russell, but his shot from 
the top of the box toward the far post 
was just wide to the left 

"We did get our confidence 
knocked in the previous game," 
Armstrong said. "We started to get 
it back a little bit avinst Davis, and 
perhaps we need to get something 
good out of (the tie] . I guess we're 
halfway back." 

In the 1-1 game, UCSD took 
nine shots, while the Aggies had 15. 
Nine of UC Davis' anempts came 
in the second half. Despite a fair 
number of shots in the glIme, nei-
ther Cookson nor Aggie goallceep-
er Nic Platter had to make a save 
afrer the first half. Both goalies 
made twO saves in the first. 

W ith the tie, the Tritons' 
record moved to 5-3-1 in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 

Association and 6 - 3 - I overall . 
UCSD, which had been sitting in 
first place all alone for over a 
week, is now tied with Cal Poly 
Pomona for the top spot in the 
CCAA South at 16 points apiece. 
CSU San Bernardino sits three 
points behind in third. 

The Aggies are now 4-1-2 in the 
CCAA and 5- 1-4 overall, and they 
are currently in the second position 
in the CCAA North behind Chico 
State. Davis is ineligible for the 
CCAA Championship because this 
is its final year as a member of 
Division II before a moving up to 
Division I. 

UCSD will now hit the road to 
take on CSU Stanislaus on Oct. 
10 and CSU Bakersfield on Oct. 
12, while the Tritons' CCAA 
South division rivals Pomona and 
San Bernardino will each play a 
game against UC Davis and Chjco 
State. Armstrong noted the 
importance of this weekend road 
trip. 

"This will be a big weekend 
beea use if we don't take care of 
business at Stanislaus and 
Balcersfield, and Pomona and San 
Bernardino each win their two 
games, we'll be down in the gutter," 
he said.

Tritons sweep regionals 
Men's tennis wins singles and doubles 

By CYNTHIA CHAVEZ 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's tennis team 
kicked off its preseason by com-
peting in the Intercollegiate 
Tennis Association West 
Regional Tournament in 
Pomona, Calif. from Oct. 2 to 
Oct. 4. This annual tournament 
is different from the regular sea-
son tournaments because players 
competed individually rather 
than as a whole team in order to 
determine player rankings for the 
upcoming season. 

The missing presence of the 
highly competitive schools from 
Hawaii coupled with UCSD hit-
ting all its strides allowed the 
Tritons to control play through-
out the weekend. 

"Since the Hawaiian schools 
weren't (at the tournament], we 
all felt like we had a good shot at 
doing well," junior Bryan Swatt 
said. "Our goal was to have as 
many (UCSD players] in the 
quarterfinals and semifinals as 
possible." 

Three out of the top four seeds 
in singles were Tritons with 
senior Sameer Chopra seeded 
No. I, Swatt seeded No. 2 and 
junior Emil Novak seeded No.4. 

Chopra, Swatt, Emil Novak, 
Tomas Novak, Brent 
Molden, Amir Nejad , Jeff 
Wilson, Nick Morton and Sean 

Higginbotham all played in the 
singles bracket. In addition, 
Swatt and Nejad, Morton and 
Molden , Wilson and Chopra, 
and the Novak brothers teamed 
up to play doubles in the tourna-
ment. 

Out of the six colleges com-
peting, UCSD players dominated 
from the beginning, losing only 
two of 18 singles matches in the 
first through third rounds. In 
addition, UCSD dropped only 
one match out of eight in doubles 
through the second and quarter-
final rounds. Six of the eight 
players in the singles quarterfi-
nals and semifinals were Tritons. 
Three of the four doubles pairs in 
the semifinals were composed of 
UCSD players. 

The Tritons continued their 
domination late in the tourna-
ment, sending all their players to 
the finals for singles and doubles. 
Swan captured the title in the 
men's singles portion, defeating 
Emil Novak 6-3, 6-3. Winning 
doubles was the senior pairing of 
Wilson and Chopra, getting past 
Swatt and senior Nejad with a 
score of 8-3 . 

This strong showing was a 
pleasant surprise to UCSD men's 
tennis head coach Eric 
Steidlmayer. 

"OUT team performed a bit 
better than I thought that they 
could. I was pleased al1 the way 

through the lineup with the way 
we competed. Obviously, a guy 
lite Bryan (Swatt) really showed 
he has improved from last season, 
but I think there are several play-
ers who also have made 
progress," Steidlmayer said. "As 
for the upcoming season in 
spring, it is much too early to tell 
what one good result will show 
for us, but certainly it is a 
positive ... 

The West Regionals finals vic-
rary for Swatt, Wilson and 
Chopra earns them a trip to 
Corpus Christi, Texas, on Oct. 15 
to play in the Division II National 
Championships. Swatt will play 
singles, while Wilson and Chopra 
team up for doubles. 

"1 am hopeful that they will go 
to win, gain some experience and 
have fun," Steidlrnayer said. "This 
is the only national champi-
onships for Division n, so 1 am 
very pleased that our players will 
be able to participate." 

In addition, Swatt and his 
teammates hope that the success 
of this tournament will put 
UCSD on the map and help out 
with recruitment in the future. 
He is also looking forward to 
playing in Corpus Christi. 

"I'm really looking forward to 
competing against the best in the 
country," Swart said. "It will be 
tough, but I am hoping to play 
well and represent UCSD." 

Soccer: UCSD comes from behind again 
continued from page 20 

deflect Treankler's effort. 
Less than a minute later, 

Cochran again stole the ball after 
a UC Davis misplay and drove 
down the right flank.. She cen-
tered the ball to none other than 
TreankJer, who was victimized by 
Lizak for the second time in 40 
seconds at point-blank range. 

The Aggies game plan was 
obvious early on. They played the 
Tritons physically, evidenced by a 
lopsided count of 19 fouls to 

UCSD's eight. Yet UCSD was 
unable to capitalize on the numer-
ous free kicks, including two that 
were virtual shon-corners. 

UCSD seemed to have trouble 
early on beating the UC Davis 
offside trap. The Aggies pushed 
up hard after every clearance and 
frequently caught UCSD for-
wards slow to get bade. The trap, 
mixed with the Aggies physical 
play, made the first half slow 
going for the home: team's 
offense. But the UCSD defense 

played very well, led by senior 
centerback Sarah Schopbach. 
Senior mid fielder Kristen 
Conahan frequently dropped back 
in coverage to mark open Aggies. 

The win brought UCSD's 
record to 8- 1 in league play and 
10-1 overall . Their next game is 
OCt. 10 at Cal State Stanislaus. 
Their next league home game 
will be Oct. 29 against California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
South division rival Cal Poly 
Pomona. 

Water polo: Tritons fall to Cal and UCLA 
continued /rom page 20 

only 2:50 remaining on the game 
clock, driver Chris Eichoh. 
scored to give the Tri tons their 
only lead of the game, but it was 
enough for the win . 

The victory over UCI pitted 
the Tritons against UCLA for 
the fifth -place game at the tour-
nament. This was the second 
time in less than two weeks that 
the teams played each other, 
after the Triton were defeated 
5-3 at the UCSD Canyonview 
Pool on Sept. 26. 

The Bruins jumped out to an 
early 2-0 first -quarter lead and 
were able to maintain it as the 
Tritons' offen e trailed for all 
four quarter, not allowing 
UCLA to let up until the final 
bUl.zer. Fundamental mi takes 
were to blame in the goal differ-
entia l. 

" We had a few glaring mis-
takes," USTa zcwski said. "There 
were three or four key turnovers 
and key ituation that they cap-
italized on. We had a trong sec-
ond-half ounterattack and start-
ed to pick it uJ1, but we ju t ran 
out of lime." 

'oach Denny Harper 
a e cd the 10 s differently, 
poi nting oul that U LA go lie 
J eph Axelrad had an astound-
ing ga me against the Trit ns, 
blocking 10 shots incl uding a 
fou r-meter pe n Ity ho t by 

Hopkins, in addition to specific 
UCSD flaws . 

"It was good not having to 
deal with the psychological 
buildup of last week's home 
crowd. I think we played better 
the second time. We had more 
offense even though the scoring 
line was eerily similar," Harper 
said . "We went one for eight on 
man-up scoring opportunities in 
the second game, when we were 
two for 12 last week." 

The 6-4 10 s to UCLA left 
the Tritons in ixth place at the 
NorCal Tournament, but over-
all, the team is optimistic. After 
all, this year's Triton quad is 
ranted higher after this tourna-
ment than any UCSD team 
before it. 

"We talked to Denny after 
the (UCLA] game, and he 
helped us ee that we are a legit, 
top -level team," Usta zewslci 

said. "We can play with any team 
in the country." 

A recurring problem for the 
Tritons this weekend was an 
inabil ity to start the game 
aggressively enough. Opponents 
won the first quarter of each of 
the four games, outscoring the 
Tritons, 6 - 12 . This deficit came 
back to haunt the team against 
UCLA, when a two-goal, first -
quarter pread turned out to be 
game-deciding goals. 

"The issue has been 
addressed wi th the team. I have 
talked to the captains about the 
team warm-ups and we have a 
plan to improve them," Harper 
said. "Some teams start fast and 
other ju t tart slow. We had a 
lot of first-period blown oppor-
tuni ties and we were not con-
verting great opportunities that

Tritons take sixth at NorCaI 
Men's water polo goes 2-2 in tourney 

By MATT GRANT 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD men's water polo 
team went 2-2 at the orCa I 
Tournament on Oct. 4 and 5, 
with wms over rivals • o. 9 UC 
Irvine and o. 13 Universiry of 
Pa III ,while uffering losses to 
• o. 4 UC Berkeley and o. 7 
UCLA at Stanford's Aver 
Aquatic enter. 

The Tritons' defensive play 
was slow in the first quarter 
again t Pacific on Oct. 4, as 
UC D was outscored 4-3 in the 
openi ng quarter. But thanks to 
five first-half goals by junior 
Jonathan Hopkins, UCSD cap-
tured a 7 - 5 halftime lead and 
never looked back . J unior 
Brandon Borso add ed three more 
goals, while seni ors Matthew 
Ustaszewski and Matt EIlts, 
along with jun ior Clark 
Peterson, each contributed one 
to the 11 -8 Triton victOry. 

Saturday's second game was of 
significantly greater importance 
to the TritOns, as they went 
agai nst eventual tournament 
champions Cal. 

"Cal was a pretty big game 
because a win would have put us 
into top four in the rankings," 
Ustaszewski said.

defense waned in the first hal f,

"It was a pretry phy ical 
game," Ustaszewski said. "They

UCSD head coach Denny

Men's soccer earns first tie of year 
Tritons fall, share first place in CCAA 

By ANUKUMAR 
Associate Sports Editor 

T he UCS D men 's soccer 
team had a chance to knock off 
Its second top-II opponent in 
one week when It fa ced o. II 
UC DaVIS at Triton Soccer 
Stadium on O ct. 5. 

However, that would be a 
tough task for the Triton, who 
had on Sept. 28 beaten CSU 
Dominguez Hills, ranked o. 2 in 
the nation at the time. The Aggies 
came to San Diego with a school -
record- ettlng streak of SIX 
straight shutouts; the UC DaVl 
defense hadn't allowed a goal In 
477 con ecutlve mmutes. The 
Tntons ended the Aggie scoreless 
)treak and recorded a I-I tie. 

UC DaVIS gave up its first goal 
111 seven games when UCSD 
earned a 1-0 edge on a c mer kick 
at the 28:49 mark of the game. 
Sophomore defender Robert 
S teti na took the free kick and got 
the assist when sophomore mid-
fielder Matthew Davey, who was 
standing near the front goal POSt, 
headed the ball back over his head 
and JUSt underneath the crossbar. 
The score marked Davey's fourth 
goal of the cason. 

"We got our goal , and we got 
the lead," UCSD head coach 
Derek Armstrong said. "We ba i-
caJly spent the r t of the game 
tryll1g to keep it." 

UCSD tried to mainta in its 
lead by taking care o f the ball 
and keeping it on the Aggie Side 
of the field . In a disappointing 3-
I loss to Chico Sute JUSt two 
days prior to the U Davis 
match, the Tritons didn 't take 
care of the ball and often gave it 
away. However, in the first half 
and throughout the majority of 
the second, U SD managed the

The momentum of the game

UCSD gets second 
comeback win in a row 
Women's soccer rallies 
back against UC Davis 

Holy cow: UCSD'Mlmen's soccer team scored two goals in the second half to 
defeat UC Davis. The Aggies knocked the Tritons out of the playoffs in 2002. 

By ALAN McBROOM 
Contributing Writer 

After the UCSD women's soc-
cer team reversed a 2- 1 halftime 
deficit to beat Chico State on Oct. 
3, head coach Brian McManus said 
the Tritons usually play their best 
soccer in the second half. His state-
ment held true on Oct. 5 as his 
team came from behind to defeat 
UC Davis, 2- 1. 

Faced with a one-goal deficit at 
the half for the second straight 
game, UCSD came out and netted 
two goals in the closing frame to 
defeat the visiting Aggies. The 
Aggies bounced the Tritons out of 
the NCAA Division II playoffs last 
year in a penalty kick shootout 
thriller. The Tritons played like 
they had something to prove, or 
more appropriately, a wrong to set 
right. 

"We have lots of rivals, but this 
game was a grudge match," senior 
defender Molly Carl on said. "We 
wanted to prove that the playoff 
game was a fluke. And it was a 
fluke ." 

UC Davis jumped out to an 
early lead at the 12-minute mark. 
Forward Leifa Mayers was on the 
glory end of a beautiful cross, and 
she headed the ball past UCSD 
goalkeeper Jarrue Lautenschleger. 
Besid that, the juruor goalie had a 
quiet afternoon, with UC Davis 
never really making any other 
threats . Lautenschlager gave way at 
halftime to sophomore keeper 
Alyson Berger. 

Carlson prevented the Tritons 
from going into halftime with an 
even larger deficit. After a U 
Davis corner, she headed away a 

shot from the top of the box that 
was destined for the back of the 
net. 

"r was just trying to head it any-
where but the back of my own 
goal," she said. 

Appropriately enough, UCSD 
scored its first tally on a UC Davis 
deflection. Senior Kristin Jones 
directed a shot past the UC Davis 
keeper that appeared to be headed 
over the end line for a goal kick. 
But Davis defender Katie 
Shesgreen slid into the ball and 
redirected it straight into her own 
net. 

T he game remained tied until 
the 67th minute, when freshman 
striker Kelly Cochran was 
dragged down in the box after 
beating her defender. Cochran 
was rewarded with a penalty kick, 
much to the delight of th e 340 
fans in attendance . The goalie 
leaned lightly toward her right, 
and that proved fatal. Cochran 
slotted a low line drive into the 
left corner for her fifth goal of the 
eason. She has scored goals in the 

each of the Tritons' past three 
games. 

Cochran showed that she could 
do more than JUSt core . Before 
her penalty ki Ie, with the match 
till tied, she tole the ball from a 

UC Davis player and drove down 
the left side of the field unop-
po ed. When she drew the last 
defender to her, he laid it off for 
sophomore Lindsey Treankler, 
who found hersel f one -on -one 
with U Davis goalie Kry tyn 
Lizak. Lizak cut the angle down 
well , however, and managed to
