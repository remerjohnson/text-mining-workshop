Campus Life 
Bill Proposes 
Triton 
Football Team 
REFERENDUM: Student-
sponsored bill would increase 
activity fee by $29.50 
By Karen Cheng 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD may have its own football team if a 
new Associated Student bill gathers enough 
student support to be put it on the Spring elec-
tions ballot. 

The "Campus Life Bill,"which is intended to 
improve the quality of non-academic life on 
campus, would increase the $13.50 Student 
Activity Fee by $29.50, of which $15 would go 
toward financing a National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Division III football team, $10 to 
finance other intramural athletics and $4.50 for 
A.S. Programming event. 

Proposed by Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Greg Hearn, Roosevelt College junior Jeff 
Woods; and A.S. Vice President External 
Damien Wilpitz, the Campus Life referendum 
is currently being circulated for student signa-
tures. Fifteen hundred students have already 
signed the petition, which needs 3,500 student 
votes to get on the ballot for the Spring Quarter. 

"I'm strong y in support of this bill, because 
it doesn't just support a football team, but other 
intramural and club sports, which es entially 
have always been self-funded," said A.S. Presi-
dent Carla Tesak. She added the increa e in 
funding would al 0 help A.S.-funded groups 
and allow for more university-spon ored events. 

However, UCSD's representative to the UC 
Students Association Naomi Falk said the fee 
increa e would not be enough to support a 
football team. "I'm against this bill, mostly 
because I think it will take a lot more than 
$29.50 to su!>tain [non-academic] programming 
on this campus," she said. 

According to Hearn, having a football team 
is an essential part of the American university 
and American culture. He added that it would 
increa e alumni support. 

"There is no allegiance to this univer ity 
because basically, mo t alumni didn 't enjoy 
coming here. This school needs ome kind of 
unity - whether through athletic programs or 
other program ," Hearn said. 

Falk said he is skeptical about the benefit 
of a football team. "It's true that there might be

Library Walk Plan Draws Fire from Faculty and Students 
CONSTRUCTION: 
Pathway to stretch

By Francisco DeVries 
Senior Staff Writer 

A $2.5 mill ion campus walkway, lated 
for construction later this month, has drawn 
heavy criticism from several facu lty mem-
bers and tudent groups angry over perceived 
admini trat io n misinformation about the 
project. 

When completed, the quarter-mile long, 

30-foot-wide walkway, called Library Walk, 
will run from University Library to the new 
Cellular and Molecular Medicine Building. 

The construction project will completely 
replace Hutchinson Way and require the re-
moval of230 eucalyptus trees from the grove 
above the Price Center. Nearly 700 eucalyp-
tus trees will be planted in the grove and along 
the walk when the project is completed. 

According to Assi tant Vice Chancellor

Working on the cutting edge of 
AIDS research, UCSDscientistsare 

to attack the HIV, infants usually 
develop fUll-blown AIDS by age 
two and die within a few years. 

While this may help to prevent 
babies infected with HIV from de-
veloping AIDS, researchers are hesi-
tant to hail it as a cure. 

. exploring two unique gene-therapy 
treatments thought to potentially 
slow, and in some cases prevent, the 
development of the AIDS virus. "I don't want to overstate it," 

Each technique 
involves the extrac-
tion of a patient's 
healthy cells, which 
are then genetically 
altered to include an 
AIDS-fighting 
ribosyme before be-
ing transfused back 
into the patient. 

Babies may be 
the first beneficia-
ries, as one tech-
nique attaches an 
AIDS-resistant 
ribozyme to the 
patient's immature 
stem cells, which are 
abundant in new-
borns. 

"[Babies] have a 
ready source of core 
blood with a high 
number of stem 
cells," said UCSD 
researcher and 
School of Medicine 

said Wong-Staal. 
"It 's always a pos-
sibility ... but I don't 
want to raise false 
hopes." 

Looney agreed 
there are many un-

in the process .

Assistant Professor David Looney. 
Flossie Wong-Staal, a UCSD 

researcher spearheading the stem· 
cell project, said she is excited about 
its possibilities, because of the stem 
cells' capabilities of proliferating 
into numerous AIDS-resistant cells. 

"Its been shown 
in experiments .. . that its capable of 
cleaving HIV RNA," said Looney. 

Looney said the idea is still in a 
"test concept" mode, because of the 
amount of lymphocytes that would 
need to be transfused. "For a typical 
case, its seven billion lymphocytes 
we're putting back in the patient," 
said Looney, 

Groups Rally for Affirmative Action 

"T-cells eventually die, but stem-
cells give rise to mature T-cells," 
said Wong-Staal. "Stem-cells re-
populate themselves." 

Giving infants stem-cell transfu-
sions may theoretically prevent 
AIDS from developing in newborns. 
The stem-cell process involves ex-
tracting blood from the umbilical 
cord, where a high concentration of 
stem cells exist. The cells are then 
armed with an AIDS-fighting ribo-
some before being injected back into 
the patient. 

Wong-Staal said the stem cells 
would mature inlo a variety of 
healthy, AIDS-resistant cells, in-
cluding T-cells, which acts as the 
backbone of Ihe immune system. 

"The opportunity is there to sig-
nificantly impact [the virus] or to 
even eliminate it if the infant was 
treated early," said Stephen Spector, 
head of the pediatric AIDS program 
at UCSD. 

Seven billion, however, is just a 
small fraction of the total T-cell 
count in the human body. With the 
majority of the body's lymphocytes 
remaining vulnerable to the AIDS 
virus, researchers hope the treated 
T-cell minority can at least slow any 
progress made by the AIDS virus. 

Another disadvantage of the lym-
phocyte treatment is the inability of 
T-cells to proliferate into a large 
number of AIDS-resistant cells. Ef-
fective treatment would require 
multiple lymphocyte transfusions to 
slow the progress of AIDS. 

"Ideally we would like some-
thing where we could just give ... a 
shot to someone," said Looney. 
"This is probably not the most ef-
fective long-term solution." 

Both gene therapy treatments 
remain in research phases while the 
safety of each technique is being 
determined. According to Spector, approxi-

mately 25 percent of babies born to 
mothers infected with the AIDS vi-

An organization called the "No Going Back" Com-
mittee will hold a rally today during the national 
convention of Associated General Contractors (AGC) 
to protest what the committee says is the AGC's 
"systematic efforts" to dismantle affirmative-action 
programs. The rally will take place at noon at the San 
Diego Convention Center. 

The "No Going Back" Committee, a coalition which 
includes the San Diego Urban League and the San 
Diego chapter of the National Organization for Women 
(NOW), was formed to support affirmative action In the 
face of recent attempts to eliminate the program. 

Members of the committee say that the construc, 
tion industry has a long history of discrimination. 
According to San Diego Urban League President John 
Johnson, the AGC is "motivated by greed which has at 
its core the same racist and sexist beliefs which 
institutionalized the horrors of slavery and the eco-
nomic oppression of women. "

RESOWTION: UCSD 
Senate opposes cuts to 
cultural endowments 
By Tom Barkley 
Associate News Editor 

As the U.S. Congress readied the 
budget lIX"to hack off federal fund-
ing for the government's two major 
cultural institutions, the UCSDAca-
demic Senate declared its "strong 
opposition" to the proposal in a reso-
lution published last Tuesday. 

"The cuts would affect individual 
scholars and research possibilities 
in the humanities and the arts," 
Marino said. " It would also have an 
effect on the transmission of ideas 
in society." 

On Feb. 22, the two agencies 
were given'a glimpse offuture fiscal 
tightening when a House subcom-
mittee voted to cut $5 million from 
each of their budgets for this year, 

the endowments in its resolution, 
stating that "the charges of alleged 
politicization of funded projects 
misconstrue the fundamental prin-
ciple of objectivity insured by peer 
review."

authorization in Congress this year. 
Hearings to decide the fate of the 
organizations will coincide with the 
planning of next year's budget.

more alumni support and more 
financial benefits with a football 
team, but UCSD is not in Division 
I," she said. " It 's only the Division 
I teams that will reap benefits." 
She added that a move to Division 
I would require a football stadium, 
athletic scholarshi ps and the pos-
sible lowering of academic stan-
dards. 

Hearn, however, said that if the 
Campus Life Bill passes, it would 
not affect UCSD's division stand-
ing, and athletic scholarships 
would not be available. 

"Weshould focus moreon what 
we can do for students now," Falk 
said, adding that the money could 
be used in more productive ways, 
such as supporting the existing 
sports and reinstating the Physical 
Education Department. 

"It doesn't make sense if we 
have a Division III football team 
but no P.E. department," Falk said. 

According to UCSD Intercol-
legiate Athletics Director Judith 
Sweet, the administration has al-
ready reviewed the bill and is in 
support of it. 

In the resolution, the Senate states 
its support for the National Endow-
ment for the Arts (NEA) and the 
National Endowment for the Hu-
manities (NEH), which " have revo-
I utionized the way research is being 
done in the arts and the humanities 
worldwide and ... have partly shaped 
human civilization as well as our 
own American cultural and artistic 
heritage." 

Alexander and 
NEH Chairman 

Academic Senate member chairsthecommit- "The athletic department wants 
a solid Division III football team 
and program. Division moving 
would require more consultation," 
he added. 

"I've tried to help the students 
understand the costs and what ex-
actly is necessary to finance a foot-
ball team," Sweet said. "However, 
we are not just talking about a 
football team - this brings up a 
lot of other issues such as facility 
costs, staffing concerns and gen-
der equity concerns, which would 
be resolved through the financial 
allocation. But if it passed, we 
would definitely do our best to 
make it work." 

The endowments, which each 
receive less annual federal funding 
th~n do military bands - $167 mil-
lion for the NEA and $177 for the 
NEH - have been targeted along 
with other agencies by the 
RepublicanCongress for budget cuts 
and eventual termination. 

UCSD Biology Professor and 
Academic Senate member John 
Marino said the cuts could have , 
major consequences for the endow-
ments, which were founded in 1965 
to promote the humanities and the 
fine and performing arts.

after two days, the mutilated body of the child, dis-

carded in the tall grass. 
She had been strangled, 
and bore the brunt of re-
peated rapes. Shortly 
thereafter, a 33-year-old 
man named Jesse 
Timmendequas was ar-
rested and charged with 
the crime. 
Timmendequas, with two 
prior convictions of sexu-
ally assaulting you ng 
girls, confessed to the 
rape and murder of little 
Megan. 

Timmendequas had 
spent six years in what the 
press referred to as a 
"treatment facility" and 
was only recently re-
turned to the community. 
Along with two other 
convicted-rapist 
"rehabilitees," he lived 
across the street from the 
Kankas. After he was ap-
prehended, his neighbors 
told reporters, as neigh-
bors so often do in these 
circumstances, that he 
had been a quiet man.

Twenty years 
of liberal 
coddling of

their toll on 
public 
sympathy, 
and citizens 
around the 
nation are 
reacting with 
a vengeance. Hamilton Township were 
rightly outraged that a twice-convicted pedophile 
could roam amongst them in anonymity. They or-
foa nized a petition which gathered 200,000 signa-
tures to demand the passage of a state law requir-
ing corrections officials to notify people when a 
sex offender moves into their neighborhood. This 
crusade soon spread from New Jersey to New York, 
where similar legislation will soon be proposed in 
the State Assembly. 

Twenty years of liberal coddling of criminals 
have taken their toll on public sympathy, and citi-
zens around the nation are reacting with a ven-
geance. From coast to coast, citizens circulate pe-
titions and initiatives to publicly protest the regnant 
liberal preoccupation with the privacy rights of 
criminals. 

Nowhere is this obsession more clearly stated 
than in a New York Times editorial entitled, "Deal-
ing With Sex Offenders." Typical of liberal publi-
cations, it decries the petition drive by concerned 
parents as "hysteria" and "legislative lynching."

Ignoring the 
rights of sex 
offenders 
alienates them 
from society 

Shame has long been associated with sex. The boundaries confining sex, still existent in this era of open-mindedness and tolerance, are rigid and stifling. How, where and with 
whom one does it can determine its acceptance or 
even its legality in society. 

However, some of these limitations are not cre-
ated simply to suppress an individual 's sexual cre-
ativ ity. Rape, prostitution and sexual activity with 
minors transgress the bounds of sexual freedom in 
the eyes of the public. These crimes are punish-
able by a combination of jail time, heavy fines and 
community service. But some of the more conser-
vative members of government want to use shame 
as part of the punishment. 

Megan 's Law, which requires the police to no-
tify a community when a sex offender moves into 
the area, took effect last January in New Jersey, 
and has already claimed its first victims. These sex 
offenders have already 
served their time and ex-
piated their crimes. Their 
right 10 privacy was de-
nied while they were in 
jail, so why does society 
need to deprive them of 
it once they re-enter the 
community? Disregard-
ing the fact that it is un-
constitutional to deny a 
citizen his right to pri -
vacy, it is dangerous to 
advertise a person's 
criminal history to a com-
mun ity whose fi rst 
thought is to protect it-
self. The sex offender 
may receive threatening 
phone calls, endure de-
struction of his property 
and suffer phys ical vio-
lence. • 

Richard Marter, a con-
victed sex offender who 
served 16 years in prison 
after fond li ng a seven-
year-old boy in hi s car, 
can attest to this fact. 
When Marter attempted 
to move into the area of 
Riverside, NJ, he was met 
with vigilantism. The fol-
lowing weekend after his 
arrival, he was run out of 
town. He moved to 
Beverly, NJ, but was sub-
sequently chased out of

SALINAS NEWS ARTICLE MAKEs FALSE ACCUSATIONS 
Editor: . 

Tom 8arkely's article ("UCSD 
Scholar Suspect in Assassination," 
March 2, 1995) seriously misrepre-
sents the presence of Raul Salinas 
de Gortari at UCSD, specifically at 
the Center-for U.S.-Mexican Stud-
ies. To set the record straight: 

academic professional researcher, 
and if he or she presents a proposal 
to engage in serious research which 
is relevant to one of the Center's 
major areas of substantive interests 
during his or her stay. 

UCSD during the period of his as-
sociation with the Center, often ab-
sent for weeks or months at a time. 
Guest researcher appointments at 
the Center have no obligation to be 
present for any particular amount of 
time. 

Mr. Salinas was one of nine 
guest researcher who were affili-
ated with the Center fo r a part of 
the 1992-93 academic year. Like 
all other guest researchers at the 
Center - unlike the Center's Vis-
iting Research Fellows - Mr. Sali-
nas never received a penny of com-
pensation. Nor did he ever hold a 
UCSD academic appointment as a 
"visiting lecturer." 

Mr. Salinas met all of these cri-
teria. He holds two Master degrees 
from French universi ties and has 
published several books and articles 
on agrarian problems in Mexico. 
His proposed research for 1992-93 
related directly to one of the 
Center 's own principal research 
projects, dealing with the with the 
reform of the ejido sector of Mexi-
can agriculture. There was no ob-
jective basis for denying his request 
to be a guest researcher. 

Readers'Forum 
Your article clearly implies that 

Mr. Salinas was engaged in crimi-
nal activities while he was in resi-
dence at UCSD ("Plans for crime 
made at UCSD"). This is a most 
serious accusation, bearing directly 
upon the reputation and academic 
integrity of the Center for U.S.-
Mexican Studies. In fact, the Cen-
ter has no records indicating tha t 
Mr. Salinas was even in San Di-
ego at the time when he is alleged 
to have taken steps to initiate the 
plotting of a political homicide 
(March 1993). Can the Guardian 
document his presence at UCSD 
during this time? 

Guardiall possesses evidence to 
support this assertion, it should pub-
lish it immediately and, indeed, 
make it available to Mexico's spe-
cial prosecutor for the case. If the 
Guardian lacks such evidence, and 
the story is based on pure conjec-
ture for the case, a retraction is 
clearly in order. Even student jour-
nalism must meet minimum 
evidentiary standards when it ven-
tures into such territory. The Guardian welcomes lerrers and commen-

CRIMINALS: 
Communities have 
the right to know

Continued from pace 4 
istered with local authorities was 
thought to do more harm than good. 
Demanding that these pedophiles 
notify the police every 30 days of 
their whereabouts "destroys the ef-
fort of thousands of law-abiding 
former sex offenders from rebuild-
ing their lives" - to which one is 
tempted to respond, in the manner 
of David Spade's character as the 
annoying receptionist on Saturday 
Night Live: "And we should care 
because ... ?" 

The most problematic aspect of 
Megan's Law, according to the 
limes, is its demand for community 
notification: "Why, for instance, 
should a sex offender be branded 
when an armed robber, a drug dealer 
or a murderer is not?" 

SHAME: 
Using unjustified 
and humiliating 
tactics

the Martercase, and the community 
is realizing humiliation has no place 
in public policy. Shame may even 
be more detrimental than effective, 
according to former Wisconsin 
Commissioner of Corrections 
Walter Dickey, who says public hu-
miliation "tends to harden people." 
Exacting more punishment upon an 
individual who has already done 

As anyone who has not had his 
head muddled by blame-evading, 
quasi-academic studies like sociol-
ogy and psychology can tell you, a 
man capable of acting upon sexual 
intent when he sees a seven-year-
old girl occupies a special strata of 
evil far beyond that of drug pushers 
or bank robbers. 

Yet, this logic is lost in the con-
ventional wisdom of pedophile de-
fenders, who insist that what these 
animals need is more "therapy." Of 
course, this therapy never includes 
really useful things like forcing the 
rapist to spend a night with Lorena 
Bobbitt or suffer a Singapore-style 
public caning (with the rapist turned 
around) . In the lexicon of 
rehabilitationists, "therapy" usually 
means encounter groups in which 
the criminal "confronts his emo-
tions" and "deals with his upbring-
ing" or some such nonsense. When 
the rapist can offer a convincing act 
of penitence, these "therapists" 
write the criminal a clean bill of 

time does not serve justice. Using 
shame as the final punishment sim-
ply continues the alienation of the 
offender. 

The ideology grounding Megan's 
Law may seem foreign to Califor-
nians. However, it is closer to home 
than one might think. In San Diego 
County's own city of La Mesa, such 
a shame tactic is currently being 
used against prostitutes and their 
solicitors. 

The city of La Mesa buys space 
in the newspaper to publish the 
names and photographs of con-
victed prostitutes and/or their 
"johns," slang for anyone who hires

health and offer him a ticket to

Is it any wonder that the recidi-
vism rate among sex offenders is so 
high? According the Journal of 
Counseling and Clinical Psychol. 
ogy, recidivism of 136 child molest-
ers (who had been assessed in a 
maximum-security psychiatric insti· 
tution from 1972 to 1983) was de· 
termined over an average 6.3 year 
span. Thirty-one percent were con· 
victed for a new sex offense, and 43 
percent committed a violent sex

a prostitute. The first three instant 
celebrities of this plan had their 
names, ages and photos printed right 
next to the Winning California State 
Lottery number. Again, this public 
humiliation tactic is incurred on top 
of the usual punishment. 

This route of "justice" will not 

crime. The journal concluded that 
behavioral treatment did not reduce 
the recidivism rate. 

In another study published in the 
Journal of Consulting and Clinical 
Psychology, of the 197 child molest-
ers who were released from prison 
between 1958 and 1974, 42 percent 
were convicted for new sexual and 
violent crimes. Ten percent of these 
were convicted 10-30 years after 
their release - walking time bombs 
waiting for the right child to come 
into their lives. 

Such statistics speak volumes on 
legislative impotence; 197 released 
child molesters should send chills down 
the spine of any parent with even a shred 
of concern over his children. If our jus-
Iia: syslCm doesn't have the balls to 
lock up, castrate or execute these preda. 
tors, the least we deserve is the chance 
to know when one moves into town. 

Opponents of Megan's Law reo 
serve their strongest criticism of 
public information for the threat of 
vigilantism. They argue that such 

reform the world's oldest profes-
sion. Its only purpose is to degrade 
the criminal. A woman who decides 
to prostitute herself usually does so 
out of economic need. After she 
serves her time, she is likely to go 
back to prostitution to support her-
self. This need is not going to dis-. 
appear the moment her picture ap-
pears in the paper. If middle-class 
conservatives wish to solve the 
problem of prostitution, they need 
to create opportunities which can 
economically support unskilled 
members of society. 

Shame does not appear to be ef-
fective in controlling the other half

laws would make it too easy for pri. 
vate citizens to take the law into 
their own hands - to harass and 
hound the pedophile, driving him 
from town to town, away from fam-
ily and friends and possibly even 
murdering him. Opponents· of 
Megan'S Law want convicted child 
molesters to circulate amongst their 
prey under the cloak of "privacy," 
convinced that these predators can 
function normally in our society. 
Evidence already suggests that the 
"cured molester" is largely a fan-
tasy, a conglomeration of wishful 
thinking and quack psycho-babble. 
Our children must not be the casu-
alties of the failings of our justice 
system. 

Perhaps vigilantism is the best 
thing that can happen with the en-
actment of Megan's Law. Private 
citizens can pick up the slack of our 
broken justice system. After all, 
there is nothing wrong with a 
pedophile which 180 grains of hol-
low.point soft lead can't cure. 

of the prostitution equation either. 
Men will continue to solicit prosti-
tutes as long as prostitutes are 
around to be solicited. No amount 
of shame showered upon a few con-
victed "johns" is going to greatly de-
ter other men from seeking prosti-
tutes. Rather than using shame taco 
tics, the government should concen-
trate on better enforcement of pros-
titution laws. 

Legal prosecution of sexual of-
fenders is necessary and justified. 
However, public humiliation and 
unjustified invasion of privacy only 
alienates former criminals who try 
to rejoin society.

WALK: 
Continued from page 1 
but became a necessity because of 
the large number of students who 
will use Classroom Building One 
when it opens in September. 

"To have ... the conflict between 
pedestrians and automobile traffic, 
I think would just be tantamount to 
asking fo~ an accident to happen," 
Hellmann said. 

Hellmann also cited the need to 
improve the drainage system in the 
area, make Classroom Bui Iding One 
accessible to the handicapped and 
repair the poor health of the euca-
lyptus grove above the Price Cen· 
ter. 

However, at last Tuesday's Aca-
demic Senate meeting Physics Pro· 
fessor Jorge Hirsch challenged 
Hellmann's information. 

Questioning the need to spend 
over $2 million on the project, Hirsch 
said that simply closing Hutchinson 
Way to vehicle traffic would be suf· 
ficient to allow safe use of Class-
room Building One. 

Hirsch countered the 
administration's assertion, in a Li-
brary Walk background informa-
tion sheet distributed to campus 
groups by University Communica-
tions, that 50 percent of the eucalyp-
tus trees in the grove above the Price 
Center were infected with eucalyp· 
tus beetles. 

The tree assessment completed 
for the uni versity in August of last 
year found only two trees in the 
grove had bectle infestation. In ad-
dition, the study found that over 85 
percent of the trees were in fair or 
good health. 

"The campus told us [the trees] 

are sick .. .. The campus is lying to 
us," Hirsch said during the meeting. 

Hellmann admitted the Univer-
sity Communications information 
was incorrect, saying it had been 
compiled using old data. 

The 50 percent figure, he added, 
was never formally put forward dur-
ing the campus' design.review pro-
cess. Campus committees such as 
Campus Community Planning Com· 
mittee and the Design Review Board 
must approve all construction 
projects. 

"The 50 percent numberwasnever 
discussed in any of the committees 
that discussed Library Walk," 
Hellmann said. 

The information, however, was 
used extensively during presentations 
to campus organizations regarding 
the project. 

"It seems like the administration 
has lied to a lot of groups on campus 
and my group is one of them," said 
CALPIRG's Endangered Species 
Campaign Coordinator Nelson Sun 
on Thursday. 

While skeptical, Sun sa id 
CALPIRG supported Library Walk 
when it was first presented to the 
group in early February. 

Now, Sun said, he wants to meet 
with Chancellor Richard Atkinson to 
discuss the project. 

Hirsch also challenged the ad-
ministration's assertion that drain-
age problems, which resulted in se-
vere flooding of the Price Center 
Theatre and the University Library 
in 1992, have already been repaired . 

However, Hellmann said repairs 
to the drainage system after the 1992 
floods were temporary measures and 
smaller scale problems are still oc-
curring in many buildings near the 

The UCSD Guardian 

Chancellor'S Complex. 
According to Hirsch, the real 

motivation behind Library Walk is 
the creation of a "view corridor" as 
outlined in the UCSD Master Plan, 
which was created to guide all fu· 
ture construction on campus. 

The Plan marks a line from 
Gilman Drive to the University Li· 
brary as a corridor where the view 
should be unobstructed. 

This corridor will be created by 
the removal of the eucalyptus trees, 
Hirsch said. 

Hellmann, however, said on 
Thursday that the view corridor 
never figured into the design plan. 
"We aren't removing trees so we 
can have a better view of the li-
brary," he said. 

According to Hellman, the li-
brary Walk is part of implementing 
the Master Plan's call for "grand 
academic promenades" and the 
separation of pedestrian and ve-
hicle traffic. 

The Academic Senate soundly 
defeated Hirsch's motion to post-
pone construction pending further 
review by the body at last Tuesday 's 
meeting. 

Prior to Hirsch's presentation, 
Committee on Campus and Com-
munity Environment Chair 
Georgios Anagnostopoulos said 
that Library Walk has already had 
"one of the most extensive reviews 
that I know of." 

He added that the project has 
come before review committees 15 
times since its inception.

The Happiest Place on Earth Inaugurates 
'The Most Exciting Ride at Disneyland' 

Stories by Francisco DeVries, Features Editor 

With fanfare reminiscent of the OJ. Simpson trial, Disney-land inaugurated its new In-diana Jones Adventure to a 
horde of reporters from all over the globe 
last Monday. 

Introducing it as "the most exciting at-
traction we've done in our 40 years," 
Disney 's Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer Michael Eisner opened the new 
ride, which is based on the popular Indiana 
Jones movie trilogy, to over 500 reporters 
gathered for the dedication. 

"This is by far the most exciting ride at 
Disneyland," agreed Indiana lones creator 
George Lucas, who was also on hand. 

But it just wouldn ', have been Disney if 
the presentation was simply a few words 
from a couple dignitaries. 

As ""J!~s and Eisner completed their 
dedication of the new state-of-the-art at-
traction, Indiana Jones swung in on a rope 
and dramatically battled off attacking ninjas 
before mounting the podium. 

"A subtle opening . .. ," Eisner said as a 
eathless Indiana-look-alike joined them 

on the rostrum, "Thank you, Dr. Jones." 
Indy then pulled a brain-sized jewel 

from his bag and, with Lucas and Eisner, 
placed the glowing stone on a conveniently 
located serpent's head. Explosions and In-
diana Jones theme music blared as the 
doors to the Indianalones Adventure swung 
open. 

The throng of reporters and photogra-

phers, never ones to tritle with nbrmal civil-
ity ~hen free stuff is available, quickly 
abatdoned professional courtesy and 
plunged pell-mell down the walkway to the 
ride.

with 11 other people, visitors spend three 
mi nutes and 20 seconds wandering through

While Eisner decl ined to 
release the final cost of the 
attraction, it is clear by the 
incredible attention to detail 
and the impr~ssive array of 
special effects and technologi-
cal gizmos that Disney spared 
little expense. 

"We like to say that 
we had to wait for tech-
nology to catch up to our 
imagination to bu ild this 
attraction, " said Walt 
Disney Imagineering 
(WDI) Art Director Skip 
Lange. "Thisadventureis

aspects of the ride use tech-

Walt Disney Company a post-dedication news con-

the queue winds through an indoor laby-
rinth designed to look like the cavernous 
remains of a lost temple. Menacing music 
and distant rumbling set the stage for the 
ride, as does an old newsreel-style film that 
introduces visitors to Indiana's friend Sallah 
and the secrets of the "Temple of the For-
bidden Eye." 

The ride itself is something of a high-

ference. "Just as in the film 
business, the advancing digital technology 
has really altered the way we think about 
what we do .... You just have a lot more 
freedom and a lot more room to make 
creative decisions." 

The troop transports all contain their 
own on-board systems for controlling the

A Review of the Adventure 

Watch 
Your Head 

Expedition Leader Jacquelyn Faga 
stopped me as I entered into one of the 
many chambers that winds through the 
temple leading to the ride. 

"If you step on the diamonds," she said 
while pointing towards a series of jewel-
shaped carvings on the stone floor, "this 
block will fall on your head." 

Above each diamond was an enormous 
chunk of square rock precariously wedged 
in the ceiling. I laughed, feeling fairly con-
fident that Disney wouldn't actually kill off 
its guests with fall ing boulders. But I avoided 
the diamonds anyway - just to be sure. 

Such an experience is part and parcel of 
Disney's Indiana Jones Adventure. And 
considering Disneyland was bracing for 
three-hour-Iong lines when the ride opened 
for the public last weekend, this is prob-
ably a good thing. 

The line is as much a part of the expe-
rience as the three-and-a-half minutes spent 
zooming through the actual "ride" portion 
of the Indiana Jones Adventure. 

By the ti me Jacquelyn warned me about 
the diamonds, we had already passed 
through Dr. Jones' jungle base camp, the 
foreboding tower entrance to the temple, 
and a long, narrow corridor with a very 
unstable spiked ceiling that crashed down 
toward us, only to be stopped by an alarm-
ingly skinny bamboo pole. 

Human skulls, the remnants of unlucky 
temple plunderers, Jacquelyn informed us, 
were littered all along our path 

In one large chamber, authentic-look-
ing 1930s-vintage newsreel footage, fea-
turing Indy's friend Sallah, explained the 
secrets of the temple and sternly warned 
visitors not to look into the eyes of the 
angry deity, Mara. 

The line, no matter how menacing or 
exciting, however, is only a warm-up for 
the actual ride. "This is the most exciting 
ride I have been on," Jacquelyn promised 
as we neared the front. 

Once strapped into a troop transport, 
the voice of Sallah boomed out to the 12 of us

"rrhe Indiana Jones Adven-
ture] is not going to change the 
world," Eisner said at a press con-
ference after the dedication. "But 
what Disney does, and what Lucas 
Films does, is try and entertain 
people in a complicated world. 
Disneyland is the tentpole of our 
culture. We experiment here. We 
create places for people to come 
and leave behind their cares for a 
while." 

And by Disney's estimates, a 
great many people will turn out to 
the Temple of the Forbidden Eye 
to forget about theirworries. Eisner 
said that he expects two- to three-
hour lines for the ride. 

"I am pretty confident that this 
attraction is going to be a mon-
strously successful attraction," he 
said. 

With a little promotion help 
from the hundreds of reporters 
rushing back to their respective 
homes to write about Indy 's latest 
adventures, Eisner is probably 
right.

in the vehicle. 

"Hello, hello. Oh, my friends, 
the brakes may be needing a little 
adjustment. Easy on the curves," he 
said a lillIe nervously as the trans-
port pulled out of the station. 

The jeep moved quickly through 
different chambers and halls, each 
with its own near-death experience. 
We faced everything from enormous 
bugs, to darts flying just over our 
heads, to rickety wooden bridges 
that threatened to send the jeep 
plunging into a pool of lava. 

Periodically, Indy swung in on a 
rope to give us advice or warn us of 
impending danger. 

Much of the ride is designed to 
give the feeling of having stumbled 
right into an Indiana Jones movie, 
complete with a carefully choreo-
graphed musical soundtrack. 

Just as the ride smoothed out, and 
the worst appeared to be over, the 
grand finale came rolling at us. To 
give it away would be akin to read-
ing the last page of a murder mystery 
before the rest of the book, so let it

Over 2,100 representations of snakes reside In the Temple. 
suffice that nearly everyone screamed. 

Molly Lindsay, a reporter from 
the UC Irvine newspaper who sat 
next to me on the ride, summed it up 
well. "Oh my God, that was so rad," 
she said. 

Luckily for us media-types, how-
ever, Disneyland bussed in a few 
dozen high school students to ride 
along with the press so we weren't 
stuck interviewing one another. 

"Beller than a roller coaster. Defi-
nitely, definitely better than a roller 
coaster," said a still-breathless Phil 
Eurs from Cypress High School. 

"With a roller coaster everything's 
the same. With this one you don't 
know what to expect next." 

"It was really fun," added Amara 
Mcleod of Western High School in 
Anaheim. " It was, oh my God, it 
was pretty cool." 

Without much doubt the Indiana 
Jones Adventure is the next step in 
amusement-park technology. But 
despite all the hype by Disney pub-
licists, the ride seems more like a 
Pirates of the Caribbean redone for 
the 19905 than a true revolution in 
technology.

V-BALL: The 
Tritons fell in 
straight sets to BYU 

Domico Dismantles Field at Invite 
Continued from page 20 
BYU stayed focused for the en-
tire match, making quick work 
of an unenthusiastic Triton squad 
in three sets, 15-2, 15-4, 15-4. 

The Cougars were led by set-
ter Jesse Gant, who had a game-
high four service aces to go along 
with three blocks. BYU also 
capitalized on sloppy play by 
UCSD, which tallied a -.066 at-
tack percentage-against a .630 
mark posted by the visiting Cou-
gars. 

By Tedd Ladd 
Associate Sports Editor 

With jumpers who can hammer 
throw and runners who can pole 
vault, the UCSD track and field 
team has a well-rounded squad. 

But at the SDSU Aztec Classic 
and Pomona Invite last weekend, 
that philosophy got the boot as the 
Triton tracksters got a chance to 
show off their elite in two meets. 

At Pomona, both Triton 
standouts were on the men's side. 
J.J . Castner qualified for Nationals 
in the 5,000 meters with a stunning 
14:44 time, and Robert Ho won the 
steeplechase outright in only 9:43. 

The definitive UCSD highlight 
of the Aztec Classic was the effort 
of Michele Domico in the long 

jump. Flying to 17' 6.5", she nosed 
out a scholarship athlete from SDSU 
by a mere fourth of an inch. 

Teammate Tara Monaghan quali-
fied for Nationals in the hammer 
throw with a 146' 6" mark. She not 
only set a new school record, but 
also grabbed the bronze medal. 

In the 400-meter hurdles , 
UCSD's Michaela Monahan cap-
tured second place (I :05.50) - only 
a 10th of a second off SDSU's first-
place winner. 

Lisa Shepard again chalked up a 
solid day, earning sixth in the 100-
meter hurdles (15.33) and fifth in 
the triple jump (34' 11.75"), while 
Andee Rademacher snaggged fifth 
place in the javelin (100' 9"). 

The 800-meter open race was a 

true measure of greatness, as 
UCSD's Beth Porto (2:24.42) and 
Erica Nehrer (2:27.14) dashed into 
second and fourth place. Jennifer 
Wilson split the difference, conquer-
ing third in the high jump (5 '0"). 

Tritons Joyce Lee(13.13), Kathy 
Li (13 .33) and Terri Paulauskas 
(13.43) owned the 100-meter race, 
sprinting to second, third and fourth 
respectively. 

While the women were crunch-
ing Division I athletes, the UCSD 
men also did some damage. Ernest 
Clark garnered the 4OO-meter gold 
medal (49.18) in a race that Salerno 
described as "tremendous." 

Randy Buehler snatched up 
fourth in the hammer (158'), while 
Steve Sargeant (6'2") and Greg 

Stachnick {I 8'8.5") earned fifth and 
eventh in the high and long jump. 

respectively. 
Doug Olander (44'1 ") and Mike 

Wygant (43' 4.5") snagged third-
and fourth-place honors in the triple 
jump. Teammates Tom Doerr and 
Kirk Miller also finished in succes-
sion, taking fourth and fifth in the 
11 O-meter hu rdles. 

Other Triton highlights included 
Alan Grant (second in the 800 
meters), Mike Wallaee (first in 
1,500-meter heat) and James Wiley 
(second in l00-meter heat). 

"It's hard to sum up a track meet, 
but this one was thumbs up all the 
way," UCSD Head Coach Tony 
Salerno said. " I keep getting more 
excited as the season continues." 

The Tritons ' abundance of 
errors kept them out of the con-
test. Any moment UCSD gained 
momentum, it was unable to 
Jluild upon it. BYU's consistently 
strong, fundamental play buried 
the Tritons. 

"We just need to put this game 
behind us and move on. We need 
to break out of this rut and win a 
league game," UCSD's Tom 
Black said. Black and teammate 
Tyson Kerr led the Triton offen-
sive attack with seve n kill s 
apiece. 

Tritons Slip By Pomona Before Rains 

UCSD must now forget about 
BYU and instead look forward 
to the week ahead, which pre-
sents one of Ihe Tritons' best op-
portunities for a league victory. 

UCSD will take on Lewis 
University in a non-league match 
on Tuesday. Then it will lock up 
with Pepperdine - a team that 
has not been playing well oflate 
-on Friday. 

By Dan Sweeney 
Staff Writer 

All season long, the UCSD 
women's tennis team has been mak-
ing quick work out of its adversar-
ies, often requiring only Ihe mini-
mum number of sets to dispatch its 
opponents. 

Yesterday, this efficient style of 
play paid off, as the Tritons were 
able to win the required five 
matches from host Pomona-Pitzer 
just before the rain came in and can-
celed the rest of the afternoon. 

The new doubles format helped, 
too. The NCAA has adopted pro 
sets, as opposed to the previous 

best-of-three sets resulting in briefer 
matches. 

UCSD's second-seeded duo, 
Michelle Malephansakul and Yumi 
Takemoto, used Ihe new system to 
briskly dispose of Lisa Anderson 
and Trina Smith 8-3, while the num-
ber-three combination of Hilary 
Somers and Morgan Gessford pum-
meled its counterparts 8-2. 

The Tritons' only doubles loss 
came at the number-one spot, where 
Miki Kurokawa and Suzi Drage en-
dured a tough loss to Claire Churchi 
and Kristina Loll, 8-6. The twosome 
had been up 4-3, then lost a crucial 
game thaI knolled the contest at 4-

4, rather than a 5-3 advantage. The 
Pomona-Pitzer team then rode the 
momentum to win the match, leav-
ing Kurokawa-Dlage feeling as if 
they were robbed of the victory. 

"It's tough in the shorter format 
because you can ' t make any mis-
takes," laPlante said. "If you win 
them it's great, but if you lose them 
you always feel you could have had 
a second chance if you had played 
longer." 

laPlante's crew clinched il in 
singles with quick conquests. 

Somers continued her dominant 
play, keying the victory with a 
clutch, 6-1, 6-0 decimation of Lott 

at the number-two slot. 
Meanwhile, the fifth seed, 

Gessford, came through with a 6-3, 
6-3 win over Jessica Lincoln, and

Bulldogs' Bite is Vicious 
BAD BARK: UCSD lost both games of 
a doubleheader to Redlands on Friday 
By Sean Rahlml 
Staff Writer 

Can Ute- UCSD softball team 
come out of its hitting slump? The 
answer is yes, but it took two more 

with a sweep. 

losses at the 
hands of the 
Redlands' Bull-
dogs (4-7) on Fri-
day afternoon to 
do the trick. The 
Tritons (2-8) 10$t 
both games in 
close fashion as 
the Bulldogs 
scored in the late 
innings to escape 

In the opener, Lisa Gil was typi-
cally solid, facing 17 batters and 
giving up only one run on four hits 
while striking out two in five in-
nings of work. A triple by the Bull-
dogs' Jennifer Martin and two un-
earned runs charged to Shannon 
Mounger's relief statistics broke a 
one-all tie in the sixth inning. The 
Tritons' offense was not able 10 
mount a comeback, as it went down 
in defeat by a 3- I tally. 

"We were definitely up for the 
games," Head Coach Patricia 
Gerckens said. "But we made a lot 
of errors in both games - dropped 
some easy flyballs." 

The Triton offensive machine fi-
nally came out of its funk in the 
nightcap, scoring five runs in the 
second game, but Redlands 

WAR: What is it 
good for? 
Continued from page 20 

Open your eyes! Just do it. It's 
all about running and gunning. And 
is there anything prettier than an 
Alley-Oop? No way, baby! Get 
outta my kitchen! I just schooled 
you . Dunk-a-roo, dip-see-doo, 
baby i I mean, you could build a 
house with all those bricks. 

Then, you've got March Mad-
ness. Remember: the road to the 
Final Four is a rocky one. And the 
road to Hell is paved with good in· 

outscored it by one 
run, taking the victory, 
6-5. The Tritons had 
taken their first lead of 
the day in the fifth in-
ning. UCSD scored 
three runs in the in-
ning to earn a 5·3 ad-
vantage. 

The struggling Tri-
ton offense racked up 
nine hits, officially 
ending its slump. 
Contributors to the 
awakening included 
Kristen Schueler (2-4, 
2 doubles, RBI, 2 
runs), Katie Galvin 
(2-4, run scored). 
Kristen Schueler and 
Gil added two RBIs to 
the UCSD total. 

"In the second 
game we started hit-
ting," Gerckens said. 
"We have to carry the 
confidence we now 
have to our next 
game." 

The Bulldogs ral-
lied in the late innings 
to take the game as 
they scored two runs 
in the sixth and one 
run in the seventh to 
finish off the Tritons. 

Chuck NIIlrverl/G:ullf;dian 
Shannon Mouncer had her eyes on a win, 
but couldn't reel It In versus Redlands. 

"There were some crucial calls, 
but the umpire should not be the 
reason for a team's loss," Gerckens 

tentions. It's hard to beat the press, 
but try a pick-and-roll and always 
yell for the rock. Those Cinderella 
teams make their own bed, and then 
they have to lie in it. In the end, 
though, it's all about teamwork. 

But I'm forgetting about tossing 
around the old pigskin. The No Fun 
League. Who can recall the Steel 
Curtain and the first Hail Mary? Or 
when the Q rolls out on a bootleg 
and checks off his receivers before 
throwing a bomb? But you can't put 
all your eggs in one basket. You 
need to stick with your game plan, 
and play within yourself - as well 
as pick up some key turnovers, 

said. "We need to come out [Mon· 
day] and carry our momentum to a 
win." 

Those warriors of the gridiron 
sure give ittheir all. It's tough play-
ing with the big boys. Might makes 
right. And two wrongs don ' t make 
a right. It's a battle in the trenches 
every Sunday. It's Madden -
BOOM! - and AI, Frank and Dan. 
It just proves that opposites attract. 
All my rowdy friends are here on 
Monday night. Gosh, cliches are 
swell! 

I hope I didn 't leave anyone out. 
Start up the bus, baby. This game is 
over. But it ain't over 'til it 's over. 
And it ain't over 't il the fat lady 
sings. I can't take it anymore. I'm 
oulla here! C-ya!

Big St.· Benedict 
NCAA: UCSD falls, 69-57, in first round 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

" was a year that all in-
volved will not soon forget. The 
UCSD women 's basketball 
team earned its first ever trip to 
the " big dance," going 18-6 in 
. the regular season and entering 
NCAAs as the eighth seeds in 
the West Region. That seeding 
forced the Tritons to tackle the 
number-one seed in the region, 
St. Benedict (MN), on Wednes-
day, and although UCSD was 
unable to pull out the w in, the 
experience it gained will be in-
va luable in the years to come. 

Upon arriving in M innesota, 
the Tritons discovered sub-zero 
weather and, unfortunately, the 
increased comfort of the gym 
was not enough to ca lm 
UCSD 's j ittery nerves. The 
Tritons fell behind 22-8 before 
regaining its composure. 

" We played a good game 
after the initia l nervousness," 
UCSD Head Coach Judy 
Malone said . " From then on, 
we climbed back into it." 

The Tritons still trailed by 
13 at the hal f, 33-20, but their 
-play was swiftl y improving and 
St. Benedict was feeling the 
heat as the second half began. 

" In the second half, we had 
our full- and half-court presses 
on," Malone said. " We caused 
20 turnovers, and they nor-
mally don't make mistakes." 

Paced by the terrific shoot-
ing of Jenessa Bayda (6-7 three-
pointers, 24 points) UCSD 
pulled within four points late. 
The Tritons' defense stopped 
the Blazers on three consecu-
tive trips down the floor but was 
unable to convert on its end to 
close the gap. Finally, SI. 
Benedict ended the drought and 
rolled to a 10 point lead before 
UCSD clamped down. 

With one minute to play, the 
Tritons pulled within eight, but 
were unable to get closer as the 
Blazers knocked down their 
f ree- thro w. oppo rtunit ies. 
UCSD was in the penalty as the 
result of a lopsided 28-12 foul 
tally in f avor of the home town 
Blazers. 

" If we could 've come out 
better and gOllen a few calls, 
th is game could've gone either 
way," M alone said. 

Other l eaders for the Tritons 
i ncluded frehsman Karli 
Jungwirth (10 points, five re-
bounds) and senio r Stacey 
Patsko, who played sol id de-
f ense aga inst A ll -Amer ican 
Tina Kampa on the inside and 
pulled down six boards. 

"The kids didn' t think they 
w ere a national caliber team, 
but the coaching staff knew it 
all along, and now they know," 
Malone said. "They ' re eager to 
get back [to NCAAs] now that 
they ' ve tasted it."

You just gotta love cliches.

The ucSD baseball team was 
coming off a heartbreaking loss to 
La Verne at home, so the Tritons 

packed their bags 
and took their 
show to Los Ange-
les on Saturday for 
a double dip with 
CSULA. UCSD 
earned a split with 
its Division II foes 
4-5,5-2. 

The Tritons (7-
4) jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead in 

game one on Chris Miyaki's first 
home-run of the season. Starter 
Ryan Ward (3-2) kept the Golden 
Eagles quiet through the first seven 
innings, allowing only two runs. 
However, LA (7-11) used a three-
run eighth inning to overcome the 
4-2 deficit and steal the victory. 

"It was a tough loss for us, " 
Miyake said. "I felt we gave the 
game away." 

UCSD grabbed an early lead in 
game two as well on AI DelFavero 's 
RBI double in the first inning. Mark 
Hartmann made a successful debut 
on the mound, as he gunned down 

the Golden Eagles, allowing only 
two runs on two hits. 

"[Hartmann] really stepped up 
for us," Miyaki said. "Even the runs 
that he did give up were fluke ones." 

"We needed someone to estab-
lish themselves as our third starter," 
Head Coach Robert Fletcher added. 

The Triton offense exploded in 
the sixth inning with four runs to 
take a commanding 5-2 lead. Jason 
Aguilar opened the rally with a 
single. Miyaki kept it going with a 
deep double off the left-field wall 
and DelFavero walked to load the 
bases. Craig Burke then put the 

Cougars Tear Up llitons 
RIPPED: UCSD fell to BYU in straight sets on Saturday 
By Jeremy Malamed 
Staff Writer 

Only a few days after recording its first 
victory of the season with a win over the 
lowly La Verne Leopards, the UCSD vol-

leyball team was back in 
action - on the prowl for 
a second-consecutive vic-
tory in a league match 
against the BYU Cougars. 

Sports Federation play on Saturday night. 
It was a return trip to the main gym, and 

despite having that first victory safely un-
der their belts, UCSD was still out to prove 
something to their conference foes - op-
ponents who have witnessed only one vic-
tory in league play from the Tritons in three 
complete seasons. 

game away with a three-run triple 
over the centerfielder 's head. Andy 
DeGrasse came on in relief to pick 
up his first save of the season. 

"After Burke's triple we took 
control of the game," Miyaki said. 
"DeGras e was also big for the 
team. Tho e two guys really stepped 
up to h,elp us win." 

The Tritons continue their road 
swing on Tueday versus Redlands. 

"I think all the games are impor-
tant. Our overall record is crucial," 
Coach Fletcher said. This upcom-
ing game i just like any other; we 
need to play hard and aggressive." 

And what about shooting 
hoops? The NBA: It's fantas-
tic. Magic and Dr. J and The 
Glide driving the lane with a 
finger roll into the paint-
there 's nothing better. Espe-
cially when the game is a nail-
biter or goes down to the wire. 
Jordan jacks it up from 
downtown (or three-point 
land) to send the game into 
O.T. Did you see that? 

See WAR, Page 15 

With the pressures of a 
winless season behind 
them, the Tritons sought to 
snap their ten-game losing 
streak in Mountain Pacific 

Brigham Young (7-6; 6-6) came into the 
match ranked seventh in the nation, hop-
ing to avoid a let-down against the cellar-
dwelling Tritons (1-12; 0-11). The highly 
ranked Cougars did not fall into that trap, 
however, beating UCSD convincin&ly.
