COUNCIL: Protestors said RCC does not address constituents' needs 
By SCOTT DOBROSKI 
Staff Writer 

The Revelle College Council 
had an unusual influx of visi-
tors at its weekly Tuesday 
mecting when dozens of stu-
dents participated in a sit-in -
organized and led by Kris 
Erickson, RCC publicity, media 
and campus relations director 
- in protest of the way the 
RCC is run. 

The RCC is the governing 
body of Revelle College and all 
of Revelle's standing commit-
tees. 

Due to the large amount of 
people in attendance, the meet-
ing was moved from the 
ReveUe provosts office to Why 
Not Here? 

Erickson said his goal in 

organizing the peaceful demon-
stration was to show the RCC 
that institutional changes in the 
framework of the council are 
both desired and needed. 

Erickson said that one of the 
majn problems with RCC is 
that it merely gives out money 
to various committees instead 
of taking a more active role in 
programming and planning 
Revelle college events. 

NThe RCC has become a 
bank," Erickson said, "and we 
should be doing a lot more than 
iust funding and watching." 

Erickson wrote a list of six 
resolutions that he wanted the 
council to address. 

One of Erickson's resolu-
tions caUed for the council to do 
more than fund events. 

"The RCC does actively 

fund organiza tions. However, 
RCC does not put on events," 
the resolution s tates. "RCC is a 
governing body and should 
cater to, and actively find out 
the needs of its constituents. 
RCC does not effectively carry 
out resolutions or proposals to 
the greater UCSD governments 
expressing the concerns of its 
constituents. RCC should 
accomplish more than financial 
business." 

In addition to improving 
support for Revelle standing 
committees, Erickson suggest-
ed that the location of the week-
ly RCC meeting be changed 
from the condensed conference 
room in the Revelle Dean's 
office to a larger and more

SEARCH: Intern hip 
office celebrate week-
long grand re-opening 
By JANE KIM 
Staff Writer 

The Academic Internship 
Program's grand re-opening, 
which began on Monday, cele-
brates a new computerized datil-
base and the addition of four new 
computer terminals for student 
use in the new ly remodeled 
office. 

Linda Feldman, director of the 
Academic Internship Program, 
said that the application p rocess 
and the individual attention stu-
dents receive will remain the 
same. The only difference will be 
the way students obtain intern- . 
ship information. 

"We probably have about 2000 
internship opportuni ties listed in 
ou r bi nders in our fron t office," 
Feldma n said. "We've been work-
ing very hard over the last two 
years to get everything computer-
ized so that students can do their 
search on computers." 

Students who have noticed the 
change preferred using the com-
puter rather than the binders. 

" It was . harder with the 
binders because people wanted to 
use the same binder and there 
would only be one binder for 
each category," Marshall senior 
Jennifer Shaw said. "I think it's 
easier to work · on a computer 
because you don' t have to flip 
through the pilges. You can just 
point lind click." 

Shaw said she found using the 
computer to be more time effi-

DISAPPEARANCE: Benefit concert will be held for Negrete at The Belly Up Tavern Jan. 30 
• By scon DOBROSIU 

Staff Writer 

. Michael Negrete, a first-year 
UCLA student from San Diego, 
is still missing after disap£faring 
from his residence at uykstra 
Hall on the UCLA campus over a 
month ago. 

Negrete vanished ~rly in the 
morning of Dec. 10, 1999 at 
approximately 4 a.m. after log-
ging off from a computer game 
that he was playing with a fiiend 
across the hall. 

The UCLA police department 
is currently investigating every 
lead it acqUires pertaining to 
Negrete's whereabouts. StiU, no 
definite conclusion has been 
reached as to why the 18-year-
old Bruin may have left the sixth 

floor of Dykstra Hall the week 
before finals. 

"People call in, and we are 
follOWing up on every I~ad," 
said Nancy Greenstein, director 
of community services for uni-
versity police. "Buras time pass-
es, we are receiving fewer leads." 

Search dogs have determined 
that Negrete took an abnormally 
roundabout path to a bus stop 
across campus. His footsteps end 
there. PoUce are also extensively 
searching Negrete's computer 
for any information that may 
explain why he left Dykstra Hall 
early in the morning while wear-
ing only a blue plaid shirt, khaki 
shorts and no shoes or jacket. 

Some speculate that Negrete 
may have suffered a stroke or 
some other event that caused 

him to behave abnormally for 
the teenager, who is described on 
his by friends and family as "the 
bright, easy-gOing type who just 
wouldn't run off on his own." 

Bill $line, Negrete's uncle 
and un<uficial spokesperson for 
the Negrete family, stated on the 
family's Web site that Michael 
was a well-liked individual who 
was highly intelligent and would 
not just disappear if he were in 
his right mind. 

"Michael is a very mature per-
son," Kline stated. "He's had a lot 
of experience performing and he 
would not react that way [natu-
rally.] He knows how much his 
family loves him. He would not 
do anything to cause them pain." 

Negrete's parents recently 
canceled his housing contract at 

UCLA and h~ room is yet to be 
filled . Message!> and ribbons 
from friends and f100rmates cur-
rently hang on his door. 

Laura Riley, the residential 
director of Dykstra Hall, stated 
that the hardest part of the ordeal 
is that there seerns to be no expla-
nation for his disappearance. 
Riley also said that while a coun-
se[or from UCLA Student 

PSYChOlo~'cal Ser.vices has been 
hell ing kstra Hall students 
dea) with e situation, there are 
still many student concerns and 
questions that she can not answer 
due to unattainable information. 

"His disappearance has had 
an impact on many people, 
whether they knew him or not,"

This week's grand re-opening 
also included an Open House on 
Wednesday, geared toward fresh-
men and sophomores who do not 
yet qualify for the program, since 
students must have 90 units in 
order to apply. However, sopho-
more Chad Valenzuela felt that 
the Open House was helpful to 
students concerned with plan-
ning for their futures. 

"The more internships you 
have, the more you get to dabble 
in the real world and find out 
what you like," Valenzuela said. 
"It's good to know about [AlP]

MP3.com Service Innovative 
But Legally Questionable 

On Jan. 12, San Diego-based Internet music 
provider MP3.com, UCSD's neighbor in Eastgate 
Mall , launched its My.MP3.com service. The system 
allows users to register albums they have purchased 
with the service and then to access any of the songs 
on these albums at any time .from MP3.com's 
servers. On Jan. 21 , the Record Industry Association 
of America filed suit against MP3.com in the New 
York Federal District Court for copyright infringe-
ment for failing to obtain permission from the own-
ers of the songs MP3 .com made available. 

While the Guardian feels that MP3 technology is an 
exciting innovation that ultimately bodes well for con-
sumers and the industry, we also feel that MP3.com's 
failure to secure permission from the copyright owner 
is a clear violation of intellectual property law. The 
company should have waited until it had secured this 
permission from the respective artists and record labels 
before launching its service. Expecting its action to 
land up in a court is foolhardy. 

The Guardian hopes that MP3.com and the RIAA 
will be ab le to resolve this disagreement quickly and 
find a way to implement this service to both partie ' 
atisfaction, but also recognizes that right now 

MP3 .com i at faull. Internet companies seem 
increasingly unable or unwilling to consider the ram-
ifications of their action before actually carrying 
them out. The Guardian hope that this trend of -
thoughtless action in such an exciting media 'frontier 
will reverse itself without the need for similar legal 
battles. 

Candidate Views Are More 
Important Than their Foibles 

It 's remarkable that even after the Iowa caucus, 
after the search for the nation's next president has 
formally begun, many Americans still only know 
small tidbits of information about the prospective 
candidates. 

While apathy is somewhat to blame, the bulk of 
our ignorance comes from the media's focus on 
unimportant information. 

It is the duty of the media, as the Fourth Estate of 
government, to seek out and present useful knowl-
edge. However, instead of nailing down what the 
candidates think about foreign policies, the defense 
budget, the environment and many other relevant 
issues, the media have overemphasized issues such

Knowing sensationalistic news is far less telling 
than whether a candidate believes in the separation of 
church and state. 

The Guardian believes that media, especially dur-
ing an election year, have an obligation to provide 
citizens with valuable knowledge, and concentrating 
on lurid information only furthers the ignorance of 
voters.

New Open Primary System, 
Won't Change A Thing 

COMMENTARY: The national political parties' rules override California initiative 
By KEVIN SEID 
Staff Writer 

The season of preSidential pri-
maries and caucuses has started 
again. The Iowa Caucus is just the 
first step in the long road to the 
White House. The New Hampshire 
primary is only a week away, and the 
other state primaries and caucuses 
are to foUow. Of course, everyone 
will have an eye on California's pri-
mary due to the enormous amount of 
electoral votes our state commands. 

The March 7 election in California 
will be the first presidential primary 
under Proposition 198, the Open 
Primary Act, which was passed in 
November 1996. Regardless of their 
political party, voters will be allowed 
to vote for any presidential candi-
date. A person registered as a 
Democrat can cross party lines and 
vote for George W. Bush or John 
McCain. A GOP voter may cast a 
vote for Bill Bradley or Al Gore. 

You may be wondering whether 
California's open primary system 
will have an effect on the presiden-
tial races. Could registered 
Republic<!1lS who favor Bradley help 
him win in California? Could inde-
pendent voters make a significant 
impact on either the Democratic or 
Republican primaries? 

No. Because the Constitution pro-
vides no guidelines on how presi-
dential candidates are nominated, 
the political parties have almost 
complete control of its regulation, 
With the help of state officials and 
the Supreme Court, the parties have 
ensured that crossover votes cast by 
Californians will not affect the presi-
dential races. Crossover votes will 
merely be acts of free speech. 

The U.S. presidency is perhaps 
the only government office in which 
voters elect the candidates indirectly. 
In primary elections, voters actually 
elect delegates who are pledged to 
support a specific candidate to party 
presidential nominating conven-
tions. The delegates from alJ the 
states then select their party's presi-
dential nominee. 

The problem is that California's 
open primary system comes into 
conflict with the rules of the national 
political parties. Under Proposition 
198, a Democrat is allowed to vote 
for a Republican delegate, and vice 
versa. But both the Democratic and 
Republican National Party 
Committees each have regulations 
requiring that only party members 
may vote for delegates to their 
respective conventions. Other politi-
cal parties have similar rules. Their 
reason is that delegates have other 
duties in addition to nominating 
candidates, such as writing the 
national party rules and platform 
and electing the national party chair-
men. The parties obviously do not 
want non party members participat-
ing in these duties. 

Delegates elected under 
California's open primary system 
can be banned from participating in 
their respective party conventions. 
The high court decided in 
Democratic Party of U.S. v. 
Wisconsin (1981) that a state cannot 
force the national political parties to 
seat delegates chosen in a way that 
violates their rules. This would vio-
late the parties' right of free associa-
tion under the First Amendment. • 

To solve the conflict between 
California's open primary system 
and the party rules, our state legisla-
ture first placed Proposition 3 on the 
November 1998 ballot. It would have 
amended our open primary system 
by permitting a dosed primary only 

for selecting party delegates, but the 
initiative was defeated. Many 
Californians still wanted the oppor-
tunity to cast crossover votes during 
presidential primaries .. 

After PropoSition 3's defeat, the 
legislature then went with plan B. It 
passed a new law changing the pro-
cedures for counting ballots. The offi-
cial results of presidential primaries 
must now also list the number of 
votes cast by voters of each party. 
Election officials would have to 
determine how Democratic voters 
voted for the presidential candidates, 
how Republic~ voted, and so forth. 

This legislation was fast-tracked 
and eventually signed by Gov. Gray 
Davis in May of 1999. 

The new law provides a circum-
vented way to make Proposition 198 
comply with the nationaf party rules. 
Ouring the primary election in 
March, Californians wiD Mill be able 
to choose any presidential candidate 
they want regardless of their politi-
cal party. 

The new vote-counting procedures 
will truly make the presidential pri-
mary closed. The results will clearly 
show the number of votes each presi-
dential candidate received from mem-
bers of their own party. Party officials 
will ~ the number of votes cast by 
party members to determine which 
delegates are chosen. Thus, del~tes 

. wiD still essentially be selected by 
members of their own party. 

Crossover votes wiD be ignored in 
deciding party delegates. ff a voter 

c~ party lines and votes for a 
presidential candidate from another 
party, it will be an act of free speech 
and nothing more. Your vote will not 
directly affect the outcome of the pri-
mary races. 

Californians .are stuck between a 
rock and a hard place. On the one 
hand, they have expressed the desire 
choose any candidate they want 
under Proposition 198. On the other 
hand, the Supreme Court has also 
ruled that our state election laws 
cannot dicta.te how the political par-

Iowa Caucuses Start Campaign 2000 
COMMENTARY: The votes are in and the smoke-filled rooms have spoken 
By THEODORE DOKKO 
Contributing Writer 

Jan. 24, 2000 marked the offi-
cial start of 'campaign 2000. 
Iowans attended the first of the 
nation's non-binding caucuses 
for both the Democratic and 
Republican parties. In the end, 
front runners Gov. George W. 
Bush and Vice-President AI Gore 
finished at the top of their packs, 
just as the pre-caucus polls indi-
cated they would. 

On the Republican side, mil-
lionaire publisher Steve Forbes 
came in a strong second with 30 
percent of the vote and former 
Ambassador Alan Keyes placed 
a respectable third place, coming 
in at 14 percent. None of the 
remaining three Republicans 
was able to receive greater than 
10 percent of the vote. The news 
for Democratic challenger Bill 
Bradley was even more bleak, 
losing to the vice president by a 
two-to-one margin. 

The campaign next heads to 
the Granite State, New 
Hampshire, which is known for 
being in4ependent-minded. 
Polls indicate that the two races 
in the nation's first primary are 
much closer than the results in 
Iowa. New Hampshire's citi-
zens, whatever their political 
affiliation, are allowed 10 vote in 
any party's primary. This allows 
for a three-man race between 
Forbes, Bush and McCain, while 
the Democratic party's primary 
is considered a statistical dead 
heat. 

In all the analysis and spin of 
late, one thing that everyone 
agrees upon is that the Iowa cau-
cus and New Hampshire pri-
maries are not as much about 

Many times the winners 
of the early states have 
been able to cash in on 
the networks and 
grassroots efforts but 
were unable to 
transform early victories 
into victories in the rest 
of the nation)s 
primaries. 
actual results as they are about 
public perception and momen-
tum. To begin with, both states 
are statistically insignificant in the 
electoral college. In addition, only 
about 10 percent of aU registered 
voters in Iowa brave the cold 
weather to indicate their prefer-
ences for the office of president. 

If the results of these two 
races truly mattered or guaran-
teed a nomination or a victory in 
the general election, historians 
would write about the presiden-
cies of Paul Tsongas, Pat 
Buchanan and Pat Robertson. 
Instead, they talk about 
Presidents Ronald Reagan, 

George Bush and Bill Clinton. 
Many times the winners of 

the early states have been able to 
cash in on the networks and 
grassroots efforts but were 
unable to transform early victo-
ries into victories in the rest of 
the nation's primaries. One can 
already discount the results of 
this year's Iowa caucus by the 
fact that the rest of the states -
including large stat~ that con-
tribute heavily to the number of 
delegates in the nominating con-
vention such as California and 
New York - have moved their 
primaries up to earlier dates. 

The front-loading of pri-
maries by these larger states 
makes it necessary for the candi-
dates to campaign across larger 
sections of the country and rely 
more upon campaign surrogates 
and television and radio com-
mercials to get their message 
out. No longer can they focus all 
of their attention on one or two 
small states. In order to accom-
plish this, the candidates need 
good campaign organizations 
and lots of money. In the game of 
politics, only the strong and 
well-financed survive. 

So what is next for the remain-
ing six major, credible candidates: 
Gore, Bradley, Bush, McCain, 
Forbes and Keyes? The name of 
the game for the GOP challengers 
is the race to be the sole alterna-
tive to the son of former 
President Bush. Political history 
shows that multi-candidate races 
in either party do not last long 
and in the end there can only be 
one front-runner and one alterna-
live. As the campaign goes forth,

OPINION 5 

Watch Out for AOL 
COMMENTARY: Customers resent Microsoft 
for being a monopoly but ignore other suspects 
By BERTRAND FAN 
Columnist 

I really do believe that, given 
enough time, the average con-
sumer will justify stealing candy 
from small children. 

I was reading a news article 
about Microsoft's Best Buy blun-
der (whereby consumers would 
get a $400 "loan" from MicrosOft 
for signing up for the company's ' 
Internet service and could then 
cancel their contract without 
returning the money) and noticed 
a quote from one shopper. The 
consumer said something about 
how he normally wouldn't try to 
cheat a company out of their 
money, but Bill Gates deserved it 
for (1 paraphrase) being the 
monopolistic bastard that he is. 

Microsoft spokesperson Tom 
Pilla replied, "This is just a shame, 
because this simply offered con-
sumers an inexpensive way to get 
wired to the Internet." 

I felt a little sick to my stomach 
at this point, probably due to the 
large amounts of crap flying 
around. 

To address the shopper 's com-
ment, this wasn't really a mistake 
or a typo on Microsoft's part. I've 
read the contract, and the only 
thing Microsoft did wrong was 
invest a Significant amount of trust 
in people that live in California 
and Oregon. Personally, I wouldn't 
place any amount of trust in any 
American, much less Americans 
that live in California. Just because 
Microsoft made the mistake of giv-
ing us the benefit of the doubt 
doesn't mean we can automatical-
ly justify bending the company 

over a chair. 
What about the "but it's 

Microsoft" argument? I haven' t 
heard very many people supply a 
legitimate reason for disliking 
Microsoft and I can guarantee 
that the grounded arguments 
didn' t come from the crowds that 
shop at Best Buy. Anybody can 
read a newspaper and whine 
about Microsoft having monopo-
listic business practices, but not 
everyone goes home and turns on 
a Linux machine, either. The same 
people that complain about 
Microsoft integrating its browser 
into its operafing system sit idly 
by and watch America Online 
and Time Warner Cable merge 
into a company worth as much as 
the GOP of India. Hypocrisy has 
now entered the building. 

Whenever you hear people 
complain about America Online, 
their comments are usuall~ in ref-
erence to the company s slow 
Internet access, sporadic 
modems, disk distribution and 
the general amount of crap that 
comes out of its user base, but 
you rarely hear someone speak 
about its monopolistic business 
practices. It's not like this is the 
first time. 

Before I even came to UCSO, 
America Online boughl out 
Mirabilis, creators of the Internet 
chat program ICQ. This purchase, 
combined with its popular AOL 
Instant Messenger program, 
marked a complete monopoly of 
all Internet messaging services 
that existed at the time. Next, it 
bought Netscape. The public,

Calling the Police Disturbs the Peace 
COMMENTARY: Noise complaints should be dealt with in person rather than involving the authorities 
By BRENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

I play the drums. I guess that 
makes me a bad person. Some of 
my neighbors seem to think so, 
anyway. 

Drums are loud . Believe me, I 
know this - there's this constant 
ringing in my head that reminds 
me of this fact. But there's not a 
whole lot to be done for it. 
Drums don't come with a vol-
ume switch; you can't plug in a 
set of headrhones and tum the 
speakers of . The fact of the mat-
ter is, YOll play the drums by 
banging on them with a wooden 
stick or a metal pedal, hence the 
ensuing loud noise. 

A few weeks after we moved 
into our house my housemate 
(who also plays the drums) was 
told by the police that they had 
received a noise complaint, and 
that if they received another 
complaint within 24 hours they 
would confiscate "any equip-
ment responsible for the distur-
bance." We're still unclear as to 
whether or not they would con-
fiscate both our drumsets, since 
they' re both in the garage, but 
we didn't think it would have 
been prudent to bring it up. 

This was at three in the after-
noon. On a weekend. No one had 
called us to ask if we could possi-
bly keep it down. 0 one stopped 
by to request that we not play 
during a certain time. No one 
even threw a brick through OUt 
window with a threatening note 
tied around it. 

Then, for a long time, nothing 
happened. Well, I mean, things 
happened - we continued to play 
the drums, occasionally guitar 

players would come over and Then I taped the notice to my

business.) opposed to the one minute it

my housemates came in the 
garage and informed me that 
there was a nice lady from the 
San Diego Police Department at 
the door who wanted to speak 
with me. 

It was the same spiel as before: 
"Noise complaint from the neigh-
bors ... you're not in trouble now 
... if we get another call within 24 
hours we may confiscate the 
equipment or fine you." 

I nodded in time with the 
words and then politely asked if I 
could possibly have a first 
response notice. She looked a little 
surprised, then said she'd be glad 
to if I could just wait while she got 
it from her squad car. She filled 
out the fonn, took down my dri-
ver's license number and had me 
ign it. I thanked her with 'a smile 

and wished her a good day. 

anything short of a nuclear attack 
or are college students; and the 
thought of college students call-
ing the police to complain about 
noise is so contrary to everything 
we hold dear that it is a simply 
ludicrous proposition. 

It's not like we don't know any 
of our neighbors. Every now and 
then they'T1 pay us a visit, includ-
ing a nice gentleman who lives 
down the street and stopped by 
one morning to say hello and ask 
if we knew who owned the car 

. with the UCSD bumper sticker 
that had been abandoned in the 
middle of the street in front of his 
house ... but that's another story. 
We don't scare the neighborhood 
children or offer them tobacco or 
alcohol or try to run over people's 
cats. We've even fish-sitted for 
our neighbors while they were 

out of town. I don't know who 
called to complain about the 
noise, but I had boped that if any 
of our neighbors wanted to talk to 
us they would be neighborly 
enough to stop by and talk to us 
in person rather than calling the 
police. I just can't bring myself to 
believe that we're that intimidat-
ing or unapproachable. 

I made a point to be nice to the 
police officer, because I'm sure she 
didn't want to be there any more 
than I wanted her to be. I imagine 
the police have better things to do 
than to convey messages between 
neighbors. Quite frankly, they 
shouldn' t have to - it's infantile 
and a waste of resources. 

There are no laws about how 
loud you can play the drums, 
how loud you can blast your 
stereo or what decibel level 
shrieking children are allowed to 
reach. It's all arbitrary. If no one 
complains, there's no problem. If 
someone does have a complaint, 
it becomes alrivate matter, and 
they shoul be responsible 
enough to treat it as such. That 
means having the courtesy to 
broach their grievances with the 
offending party without involv-
ing public authorities. 

There has been a lot said 
recently about how anti-social our 
culture is becoming; that neigh-
bors don't respect one another or 
get to know each other anymore. 
Well, that street runs two ways. 
Calling the police on your neigh-
bors and infringing on their right 
to pursue artistic expression isn't 
helping the situation. 

So if anybody wants to talk to 
me, I'll be in the garage. Just make 
sure you knock really loud.

PRIMARY: 
Party manipulation 
circumvents voters 
Cue, .. , .... frOM .... 4 
ties conduct their national busi-
ness. If the political parties dis-
agree with the way party dele-
gates are chosen in our state, they 
can change it to suit their own 

int~rests. They have been doing 
this throughout American politi-
ca l history. The parties can com-
pletely eliminate the use of presi-
dential primaries in California. 
They can institute another proce-
dure to select delegates according 
to their own rules. . 

Unfortunately, other delegate 
selection procedures would be 
worse because they are less 
democratic than California's pri-
mary. The amount of input from 
every single voter would 
decrease. Delegates could be arbi-
trarily selected by party bosses 
and back room pofiticians. The 
parties can institute a caucus sys-
tem like Iowa where voters must 
attend party regional meetings to 
select delegates. A state party 
convention could be held to pick 
the delegation. 

If California wants to have 
any voice in the presidential 
nomination process using our 
open primary system, the new 
counting procedure will have to 
do. Until the laws are successful-
ly challenged and overturned, 
crossover votes cast in presiden-
tial primaries under Proposition 
198 will be made into mere rec-
ommendations. Unfortunately, 
like any other form of speech, 
these votes can be easily ignored 
by those in power. Credit (or 
blame) must be given to the polit-
ical parties for their totar control 
over how presidential candidates 
are nominated.

AOL: 
AOL also poses 
monopolistic threat 
ContIIbued frons .... I 
being the great sponge of the' 
media, welcomed the merger 
wi th open arms, hoping that 
AOL and Netscape together 
could combat the great ogre we 
ca ll Microsoft. And now the 
Time Warner deal. I say that 
we're not combating an ogre by 
supporting AOL, we're creating 
another one. 

This being said, let me now 
explain why I think we've actu-
ally helped extend a monopoly 
by extracting $200 million from 
Microsoft. Do you really think 
that $200 million puts a dent in 
Bill Gates' pocket? Take a look at 
the planned sales of Microsoft 
stock that he makes several times 
a year. $400 million here, $200 

million there - it doesn' t really 
make a hell of a lot of difference. 

I' ll tell you where it does 
place a dent, though. The 
Microsoft Network. MSN is a 
direct competitor to America 
Online, and it's been losing 
money since its inception. 
Losses like this really make me 
wonder how long the execu tives 
will want to hang on to it, espe-
cia lly with the Justice 
Department breathing down 
their necks about the conflict of 
interest between creating 
Internet Explorer and owning an 
Internet provider that defaults to 
Internet Explorer. 

I'm not a Microsoft sympa-
thizer. I'm not even sure such a 
thing exists. I just want to make 
it clear that charging TVs and 
DVD players to Bill Gates' credit 
card isn't the noblest act in the 
world. But on the flip side, 
Microsoft isn't a charity case like 
its. spokesperson would have

you believe. The company's lofty 
goal of offering consumers "an 
inexpensive way to get wired to 
the Internet" is quite amusing 
and entirely a result of some real~ 
ly good public relations writers. 
$21.95 per month for 36 months 
equals $790. Subtract the amount 
they have to payoff in reba tes 
and Microsoft is still netting a 
pretty hig,h profit margin for a 
company concerned with inex-
pensive Internet access for the

good reasons for his candidacy 
and that he has a viable chance of 
becoming Bill Clinton's successor. 
He cannot continue to be beaten 
by such large margins as in Iowa 
in the upcoming primaries and it 
is necessary for him to secure del-
egates for the Democratic nomi-
nating convention to be held in 
Los J\ngeles. 

With the Iowa caucuses over, 
George W. Bush and AI Go:-'! can 
both notch a win. As Campaign

Kohl Admits Accepting Free Flights CHINA: 
Russia, France and 
China <;>bjected . 

The new regulations directlX 
apply for the first time China s 
state secrets law to the web, 
including chat rooms and per-
sonal e-mails. For example, the 
use of e-mail to transmit what 
might be regarded as secret infor-
mation is expressly forbidden. 
Chat rooms must screen their 
content. And Internet sites are 
reqUired to submit to "examina-
tion and approval by the appro-
priate secrecy work offices," 
although the rules do not specify 
what tnat procedure involves. 

BERLIN Former 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said 
Wednesday that after he left 
oifice in 1998, he accepted six free 
flights provided by the owner of 
one of Germany's largest media 
groups. 

Leo Kirch, who heads the 
Bavaria-based Kirch Group and 
is a close friend of Kohl, paid for 
flights from Germany to Italy 
and Austria, among other desti-
nations. 

In a signed statement Kohl, 
who is still a Christian 
Democratic member of the lower 
house of parliament, said, "These 
flights had nothing to do with 
my work as chancellor." He 
declined to comment further. 

While in office, Kohl was 
known to be broadly supportive 
of Kirch's businesses and helped 
win European Union approval 
for a pay television alliance that 
\lrought together the Kirch 
Group, Bertelsmann and 

utsche Telekom. 
In accepting the flights, first 

eported in Stem magaZine, Kohl 
did nothing illegal. A member of 

arliament accepting several free 
ights from the owner of a major 
erman media group clearly 

lays himself open to the charge 

that he is being bought. 
Kohl has said he accepted 

more than $1 million in secret 

In all, the Christian 
Democratic Union has 
now conceded the exis-
tence of more than $13 
million in illicit fund-
ing during the 16 years 
of Kohi)s government, 
The uncovering of this 
system, and KohFs seem-
ing contempt for a law 
that sq,ys the source of 
imy donation over 
$1 0,500 must be 
reTJealed, have generat-
ed a political crisis. 

payments while chancellor, but 
has refused to identify the 
donors and insisted that, "I am 
not, and have never been, for 
sale." 

In all, the Christian 
Democratic Union has now con-
ceded the existence of more than 
$13 million in illicit funding dur-
ing the 16 years of Kohl's gov-
ernment. 

The uncovering of this sys-
tem, and Kohl's seeming con-
tempt for a law that says the 
source of any donation over 
$10,500 must be revealed, have 
generated a political crisis . . 

Within the Christian 
Democratic party, Kirch's name 
has circulated as one possible 
provider of the secret payments 
to Kohl. 

This speculation has been 
based on the Bavarian business-
man's closeness to the former 
chancellor. Kirch has declined to 
comment, and no evidence of 
any payment from him has been 
found. 

Rumor is rampant in 
Germany precisely because Kohl 
has proved so obstinate in 
guarding what now amounts to 
an affair of state as a personal 
secret and saying his "honor" 
justifies this stance.

The New York Times 

been applied by Beijing to cover 
any information whose release it 
has not sanctioned. 

The new pronouncement 
may have little practical impact, 
because much of what is formal-
ly forbidden under the new 
rules was already illegal. 
Enforcement will be difficult in a . 
country now brimming with 
Internet cafes and free e-mail 
services. And government offi-
cials will be cautious about 
dampening an industry whose 
exuberant growth has been a 
magnet for foreign investment. 

For the moment, people here 
say the ~tions serve mostly 
as a very loud warning that could 
have some inhibiting effect on the 
lively discussions that now criss-
cross China via e-mail and 
through postings in chat rooms. 

The regulations illustrate 
Beijing's resolve to tame if not 
totally control the unwieldy 
beast that is the Internet, which 

- has rapidly become a means for 
Chinese to bypass the state-con-
trolled media to obtain and 
transmit information. 

A basic principal of the new 
"Computer Information Systems 
Internet Secrecy Administrative 
Regulations" is that "Whoever 
puts it on the Internet assumes 
responsibility. Any information 
provided to or issued on Internet 
web sites must obtain the inspec-
tion and approval of secrecy cen-
sorship," the regulations state. 

In the past few years, the 
Internet has emerged as an effec-
tive propaganda tool of the 
Chinese government, but also as 
a potent method for organizing 
and publicizing popular discon-
tent. It has been used by overseas 
dissidents t~ communicate with 
kindred spirits in China and by 
the banned Falun Gong spiritual 
movement to organize protests.

Gore Winning Big Benefits 
from Clinton's Backing 

WASHI GTO - AI Gore 
has not invited hi boss, Bill 
Clinton, to come out and tump 
with him, but back at the White 
House, Clinton is taking every 
chance he can to plug the candi-
dacy of his vice president. 

To the delight of Gore's s taff 
and the irritation of both Bill 
Bradley and the Republicans, 
Clinton has, day after day, 
announced policies that dovetail 
with Gore's campaign effort -
and Clinton usually says Gore is 
the brains behind them, maybe 
even the brains behind the White 
Hou generally. 

"When we took office together, 
Ihe faci that I was challenged sci-
entifically and technologically 
was a standing joke," Clinton said 
at Caltech last week as he 
announced more financing for sci-
entific research, an area Gore has 
scoped out as his own. " And he 

~ants all of you to know that he's 
campaigning all over the country 
with a Palm VII on his hip." 

The presidential announce-
ments, politically helpful to Gore, 

McCAIN: 
Keyes criticizes the 
Arizona senator 
ContInued from .,... 1 
to you and said she contemplated 
killing her grandmother for her 
inheritance," Ke~es said, "you 
wouldn't say ' let s have a family 
conference.' You 'd just say no 
because that is morally wrong." 

McCain shot back that he had 
a long anti-abortion record "and I 
will continue to mainta in it. I will 
not draw my children into this 
discussion." 

McCain was confronted with 
the polarizing social issue first 
thing Wednesday morning when 
it arose for the second day tIl a 
row on his "Straight Talk Express" 
campaign bus, which is drawing 
ever more reporters as the New 
Hampshire primary nears. 

The Arizona senator appeared 
caughl off guard when a reporter 
asked whether, if his IS-year-old 
daughter, Meghan, became preg-
nant, he would tell her that he 

range from the prosaic to the 
sweeping. 

Less than a week before the 
ew Hampshire primary, Clinton 

announced emergency subsidies 
for low-income familieS t6 pay 
heating bills in about a d~n states 
- including $5.4 million for ew 
Hampshire. The release of , uch 
financing is a presidential ritual but 
the liming was opportune for Gore. 

Days before the Iowa caucuses, 
Clinton proposed a plan to enable 
parents to enroll in the same health 
plans as their children. He said he 
had borrowed the idea from Gore, 
who had proposed it as part of his 
counter to Bradley'S more sweep-
ing health care proposal. 

Clinton will give Gore another 
big push Thursday when, White 
House aides say, the president 
will single out Gore in his State of 
the Union address and, with the 
vice president a few feet behind 
him, layout an agenda that will 
coincide markedly with that of 
the Gore campaign.

The New York TImes 

could not have an abortion. 
"No,"McCain said. "I would 

discuss this issue with Cindy and 
Meghan, and this would be a pri-
vate decision that we would 
share within our family. 
Obviously I would encourage her 
to know that that baby would be 
brought up in a warm loving 
family. The final decision would 
be made by Meghan with our 
advice and co.unsel, and I think 
that's such a private matter." 

Cindy, McCain's wife, has 
been campaigning at his side. 
McCain, who has said repeatedly 
that he is morally opposed to 
abortion, was then asked whether 
he had just articulated the posi-
tion of the abortion rights move-
ment, which argues that the pro-
cedure should not be outlawed 
but left up to individual women. 
McCain became visibly irritated. 

A short time later, -McCain 
telephoned reporters and said: "I 
misspoke. Wlial 1 believed 1 was 
saying and intended to say is that 
this is a family deci ion. '

Grandmothers Visit Eliin 
MIAMI- Two Cuban grand-

mothers and their 6-year-old 
grandson met privately 
Wednesday for the first time in 
!he two months since he was res-
cued from the sea off Ft. 
Lauderdale, where his mother 
drowned. The grandmothers 
seek custody of the boy, Elian 
Gonzalez, for his fa ther in Cuba, 
while Cuban-American rela-
tives want him to stay here. 

After the meeting, the grand-
mothers departed by helicopter 
without commenting. The rela-
tives, however, were elated by 
the diSCUSSions, although they. 
were not a party to them. 

"I feel great," said 
Marisleysis Gonzalez, 21-year-
old daughter of Lazaro and 
Angela Gonzalez, with whom 
Elian has been living. "I feel he's 
more to this side than to that 
side," she said referring to the 
grandmothers. 

After the meeting, Jorge Mas 
Santos, a leader of the Cuban 
exiles who was in the car leaving 

the meeting with EMn, spoke to a 
reporter for WSCY-TV, a Spanish 
station in Miami. Mas handed the 
phone to the boy. "I will get my 
U.S. citizenship tomorrow," a lit-
tle voice said in Spanish. 

In a news conference 
aftenvard, Sister 
Jeanne indicated that 
the principal break-
through may have been 
a softening of hostility) 
nothing more. 

But none of the family was in 
the meeting with Elian, the 
grandmothers, Sister Jeanne 
O'Laughlin, president of Barry 
University here who opened her 
home for it, and two other nuns 
who participated. 'In a news con-
ference afterward, Sister Jeanne 
indicated that the principal 

breakthrough may have been a 
softening of hostility, nothing 
more. 

"It was very touch and go for 
a long time," she said. "It was 
very definitely a family affair 
that has somehow turned into 
political agendas." Both sides 
arnved frightened and wary of 
trapdoors, she said. But, " there 
were no accusations or promises 
or trying to define the future." 

Since Friday, Mariela 
Quintana, mother of Elian's 
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, 
and Raquel Rodriguez, mother 
of Elian's mother, have bounded 
from New York to Washington 
to New York to Miami to 
Washington and now back to 
Miami to plea for something that 
would be simple enough almost 
anywhere else: the custody of a 
motherless child for his only 
other parent and for themselves, 
grandmothers who had helped 
care for him from infancy.

Coca-Cola Company to Cut 
a Fifth of its Work Force 

Humbled by a year of prob-
lems at home and abroad, Coca-
Cola Company said Wednesday 
that it would cut 6,000 jobs, or :t 
fifth of its work force, in the 
biggest reductions ever by the 
company. 

Word of the job losses rever-
berated around the company's 
headquarters in Atlanta, where 
Coke images dot the skyline, 
and where the company. has 
long been identified with suc-
cess both personal and collec-
tive. About 2,500 people, or 
nearly half the employees, at 
Coke's gleaming downtown 
complex will be let go. 

"There was a lot of crying 
today," one employee said as 
she exited the iron gates of the 
company's compound. "A lot of 
people are packing up." 

The company, which has been 
known for generous benefits, job 

ieCurity and unflagging opti-
mism about its future, said some 
employees were notified 
Wednesday, and others would be 
informed by the end of February. 

The impact on Atlanta' s 
economy is not expected to be 
severe. "It's more the psycholog-
ical rather than the economic 
impact, which shouldn't be that 
large," said Donald Ratajczak, 
director of the Georgia 
Economic Forecasting Center at 
Georgia State University. 

To cover severance packages-
and other costs related to the staff 
cuts, the company will take an 
$800 million charge against its • 
eamings this year. In addition, 
Coke announced an $813 million 
charge for the fourth quarter of 
last yea r to cover costs of its 
poorly performing plants in 
Russia and Ea!ilem Europe. 
Indicating altits problems are not 

past, the company said bottlers in 
several key markets would buy 
less concentrate this year to 
reduce bloated inventories. 

"The world in which we oper-
ate has changed dramatically, and 
we must change to succeed," 
Douglas N. Daft, Coke's newly 
designated chairman and chief 
executive, said in a statement. 
Since being named to the top job 
in' December, he has moved 
quickly to decentralize opera-
tions and make Coke more 
responsive to its various markets 
around the world. He is repladng 
M. Douglas Ivester, who lasted 
less than two years in the top job 
and was criticized for responding 
slowly to contamination scares in 
Europe and to government con-
cerns about the company's pro-
posed acquisitions abroad.

Jesse Gelsinger, who died last· 
September, was enrolled. The . 
agency also wrote that similar 
deficienCies in other studies 
could expose patients to a " ig-

Among the most serious of the 
allegations are that researchers-
led by IHGT Director James M. 
Wilson - lied to patients about 
the risks involved, changed 
research protocols without noti-
fying the FDA, mishandled 
important documentation and 
included in the study patients 
like Gelsinger who should not 
have been eligible to participate. 

The moratorium affects only 
the IHGT. All other univerSity

PRINCETON, N.J. - In the 
first test of last year's Nude 
Olympics ban, the Princeton 
University campus was conspic-
uously silent at midnight Friday 
moming, with no indication of 
any large-scale attempt to resur-
rect the now-defunct event. 

Equipped with cameras and 
blankets, Public Safety fanned 
out across campu Thursday 
night and prepared to apprehend 
and identify nude runners. 

Wally Knox, who are in the state 
assembly and have reached their 
term limits, and Libertarian 
Charles Black. 

Rego's supporters said a victo-
ry is unlikely. 

Since Rego is the only 
Republican in the race, he will 
run unopposed in the March pri-
mary elections, which will elimi-
nate one of the Democratic candi-
dates from the race. 

The 23rd di trict include 
Agoura Hills, Beverly Hills, 
Hidden Hills, anta Monica, West 
Hollywood, Westlake Village and 
a portion of the city of Los 
Angeles. Tom Hayden has been 
the state senator for the district 
since 1992. 

Rego said he hopes to attract 
votes from non-Republicans as 
well as those registered in his 
party. 

He said that he disagrees with 
Knox and Kuehl on a number of 
issues. He 0:rposes gun control, 
abortion an what he calls an 
overly centralized and wasteful 
state educational system. Rego 
also said he also opposes the fact 
that California taxpayer money 
may be used to pay for abortions 

'for women who cannot afford 
them. 

Rego plans to emphasize his 
opposition to all forms of gun 
control in Califomia, especially to 
the requirement that gun owners 
register with the government. 

Rego has no plans for formal 
fund raising or advertising, but 
the Bruin Republicans organiza-
tion plans to raise money for his 
campaign. 

Members of Bruin Democrats 
plan to work for the Kuehl and 
Knox campaigns as part of their 
"200 in 2000~' project, which aims 
to get 200 I:JCLA students to vol-
unteer a total of 2,000 hours for 
Democratic camraigns at local, 
state and nationa levels this year.

"Robotech" really was a little 
more than a "nose bleed." Add in 
those multi-mech battles and the 
producers had a good chunk of 
Americans hooked on the coun-
try's first animated soap opera. 

The most misunderstood 
aspect of animation is that it was 
created (or suitable) for children 
only. In reality, American anima-
tion was meant to be entertain-
ment for all ages. Full-length pic-
tures such as Walt Disney's 
"Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs" and "Fantasia" con-
tained satirical wit and humor 
that overstepped children and 
entered an adult domain. 

I.. Max Fleischer's "Popeye" and 
"J)etty Boop" were viewed by 
more adults than children in their 
1930s releases. And there was Jay 
Ward's "Rocky and His Friends" 
in the late '50s and Hanna Bar-
bara's "The Flintstones" in the 
'60s that pmmoted family view-

Aside from "The Simpsons,"

eyed characters. 
The end of the war and the 

start of American occupation 
brought about a cultural 
crossover that swept Japan with 
U.S. comic books and animated 
theatrical shorts from the '405 . 
These imports became so popular 
that Western-style animation 
overturned all other forms of ani· 
mation in Japan and was adopted 
into the nation's still-forming 
anime community. 

But with aU these similarities 
and connections to Western-style 
animation, it is interesting how 
these two countries still have 
such divergent subjects. Why did-
n't Japanese artists create their 
own yersion of Superman since 

the superhero theme was so pop-
ular in America? In fact, the asso-
ciation between the human 
superhero and Japanese anime 
just isn't there. But the rejection of 
this concept has direct roots to 
their embrace of anime's most 
identifiable icon - robots. 

Robots are all over Japan. The 
link between the Japanese and 
robots is not an American mis-
conception. The Japanese like 
robots the way Americans dig Big 
Macs, or at least how I dig Big 
Macs. But their affinity isn't 
based on their technological 
prowess or Confucian culture. 

The idea of robots was first 
introduced to Japan by Czech 
playwright, Karel Capek. This is 
the guy who coined the term 
"robot," which gets its origin 
from the Czech term for labor, 
"robota." His 1920 play, 
"Rossum's Universal Robots," 
offered a diabolical tale of men 
who create "artificial" life forms 
to do their bidding. The play ends 
with a revolution from the robots 
overthrowing their human mas-
ters. The play's first Japanese per-
formance at Ginza Square started 
a wave of popularity for Capek's 
work. But, more importantly, the 
notion of "artificial humans" 
remained a constant theme in 
Japanese fantasy. However, this 
wasn't enough to launch robots 
into Japanese pop culture.

The end of WWIl, rather the 
aftermath of the atomic bomb-
ings, brought a different perspec-
tive of the world to the Japanese. 
A nuclear holocaust can do that 
for some people. 

"There was this emptiness that 
couldn't be filled by any human 
means after the war. Many Japan-
ese not only lost hope in their 
country, but in humanity as 
well," said Osamu Tezuka, cre-
ator of "Tetsuwan Atomu" 
(Mighty Atom), Japan's first ani-
mated series. "[Atom) is sort of a 
21st century reverse-Pinocchio, a 
little boy robot who has trouble 
adjusting to an illogical human 
world." 

And that was the 'main prob-
lem after having a bomb dropped 
on you - adjusting. "Many 
Japanese couldn't accept the idea 
of a 'super' human after experi-
encing the other side of humani-
ty's pendulum," said acclaimed 
Japanese animator Masaki 
Sakamoto. "But robots offered an 
opportunity for humanity to 
improve upon, a sense of 
redemption. It gave hope to pe0-
ple who had lost hope in them-
selves." 

Although the Japanese didn't 
originate the idea of robots, they 
were the first to give them human 
qualities, whereas before, as Isaac

Guster Performs with Gusto ANIME: Melodramatic endings criticized 
ContInued from ...,. 12 
Asimov noted, "robots were 
considered to have a 'Franken-
stein complex' wherein man 
makes robot. Robot kills man." 

Mission Beaclis Canes Bar and Grill hosted an excellent show on jan. 18 
By AUSON NORRIS 
Senior Staff Writer 

My reaction to three-man band 
Guster's Tuesday-night perfor-
mance at Canes, on the one hand, 
might be due to the fact that I'm 
rather new to the San Diego con-
cert scene. 

On the other hand, it just 
might be! due to the fact that 
Guster really is the crowd pleaser 
they seem to be. Either way, it's 
undeniable that the trio took its 
audience by storm in a two-hour 
show that managed to be energiz-
ing, relaxing and intimate all at 
the same time. 

With the doors scheduled to 
open at 8 p.m., the ticket line -
consisting of an eclectic mix of the 
college crowd, the Iate-2Os-early-
30s couples and a few scattered 
groups of high-schoolers -
already stretched from the box 
office to the parking lot when I 
arrived at 7:30 p.m. For as little as 
$8 and without requiring its 
guests to be 21. (or even 18), the 
beachside club hosted an event 
that put it onto my "hot spot" list, 
as it should be for all other UCSD 
students stuck in that loathsome 
over-18-but-not-yet-21 age brack-
et. 

While credit is due to the club 
itself, the contributions from 
Guster themselves are of course 
in need of recognition, as well 

As the threesome took the 
stage, the band members' indi-
vidual appearances made it diffi-
cult to unagine that they could 
mesh together as a whole in the 
fluid, harmonious way they did; 

Guster consisted of a crewcut, 
khakis and loafers on guitar play-
er Adam Gardner, a hippy-
haired, hemp jewelry·~ring 
guitar player Ryan Miller and 
congero Brian Rosenworcel, 
whose red '70s-style "South of the 
Border" tank top was backed by 
his time spent in Buenos Aires. 

sounds of the guitars. 
Meanwhile, those songs that 

didn't showcase the talented con-
gero were consistently catchy 
anyway, as Gardner and Miller 
used those opportunities to 
exhibit an ability to harmonize 
their guitars as well as their voic-
es. Most often, Miller sang the 

While the musiC/d aspect of the nening was 
entertaining, Guster dtstrPe as much praise for their 
comedic yet apparently-unrehearsed stage presence as 
weu' Millers aMiability with the crowd - rnealed 
through stories, jokes and the unabashed 
acltnowledgment of mUtues - was refreshingly real. 
(yes, no "true" drum set and no 
bassist.) The more songs they 
played, however, the more musi-
cal solidity they conveyed. • 

Playing selections mostly 
from 1996's Goldfly and 1999's 
Lost lind Gone FomJeT (although 
1994's Parachute wasn't com-
pletely neglected), the band 
revealed its secrets of musical 
coordination: Rosenwoncel's 
bongo-playing abilities carried 
almost every song, giving the 
concert a Bob Marley/Dave 
Matthews-esque feel that eerily 
surpassed the quality of the Dave 
Matthews Band concert I attend-
ed in-July. 

I realize now that the Dave 
Matthews' concert stage was 
crowded with so many different 
sounds that many were often lost 
in each other, while Guster's 
smaller makeup let the bongo 
rhythms stand out among the 

lead while Gardner acted as back-
up. 

A surprisingly accurate rendi-
tion of the " Airport Song" single 
from the Goldfly record, fiowever, 
showed the pair's versatility as 
Miller took back-up and Gardner 
stepped up for the lead, proving 
that they definitely haven't 
bought into the traditional, set-in-
stone lead singer/back-up singer 
relationship most bands conform 
to. . 

Hailed as one of those rare 
groups that needs to be seen live 
in order to be appreciated, Guster 
lived up to this self-established 
label. 

Not yet so arrogantly famous 
that they convey bitterness, the 
band played all their "hit" tracks, 
opening with "What You Wish 
For" (Lost and Gone Forever) and 
completing" Almost Kind," (Lost 
and Gone Forever) "Demons" 

(Goldfly) and "Either Way" (Lost 
and Cone Fortvtr) before retiring. 

While the musical aspect of 
the evening was entertaining, 
Guster deserve as much praise for 
their comedic yet apparently 
unrehearsed stage presence as 
well. Miller's amiability with the 
crowd - revealed through sto-
ries, jokes and the unabashed 
acknowledgment of mistakes -
was refreshingly real. 

Admittedly, it could be 
argued that the band's comfort 
level was due to the size of the 
venue, as Canes is definitely not 
of the same magnitude as L.A.'s 
Staples Center or the Bay area's 
Shoreline Amphitheater, both of 
which are so large that audi-
ence-performer interactions are 
rare. 

Considering the crowd-pleas-
ing abilities (or lack thereof, 
rather) of opener Abbey Normal, 
however, I'm willing to attribute 
the show's success to the band's 
inherent ability to level with its 
audiences rather than to the size 
of the venue. 

Tuesday night's show was the 
first of Guster's nationwide tour 
to promote their latest album 
"Lost and Gone Forever." If you 
missed out but are still curious as 
to what the Canes venue has to 
offer UCSD students, NOFX will 
be performing an all·ages show 
on Tuesday, Feb. 15 at 7:30 p.m. 
for $12.

Following the map of 
anime's history, most of its 
nebulous characterizations 
come to light. The intense link 
between Japanese animation 
and its atomic roots answer a 
lot of diegetic questions about 
its structure. For instance, 
many Americans criticize 
anime for holding melodra-
matic endin~s about morality 
or humanity s responsibility to 
the world. 

But after viewing anime's 
past, it would seem almost 
heretical if it lacked tha t 
strong moral message since 
the medium, the craft was cre-
ated and molded out of 
nuclear ashes. 

One of the best animated 
films to understand this senti-
mentality, however, is su:r,ris-
ingly an American one, ' Iron 
Giant," a remake of the Japan-
ese series "Iron Man No. 28." 
The story deals with a boy 
and his giant robot. Together, 
they deal with a small town 
mired in Cold War . paranoia 
and politics. We get to see the 
human condition not only 
through the boy's eyes, but 
more importantly, the robot's 
own curiosity and innocence. 
It has great dialogue with 
more stunning graphics and 
ariimation. Grab it. Grab an 
anime video. Watch an anime 
film. Watch Toonami. Watch 
"Robotech." Because now you 
know ... and knowing is half 
the battle.

Bette Midler Returns to Classic Comedy 
Isn t She Great' delivers a quirky and smart screenplay supported bya hilarious all-star cast 
By MARC COMER ... JOE LEE 
Senior Staff Writer / Staff Writer 

Unlike many recent comedies 
that rely on Jim Carrey antics and 
unnecessary vulgarity, "Isn't She 
Great" is a return to classic come-
dy. While it doesn't hurt to have a 
stellar cast of seasoned comedians, 
the success of "Isn' t She Great" is 
largely due to the ingenious dia-
logue and witty one liners of 
screenwriter Paul Rudnick. 

Based loosely on the life of 
Jacqueline Susann, played by 
Bette Midler, "Isn't She Great" was 
taken from a 1995 New Yorker arti· 
cle by Michael Korda titled "Was-
n' t She Great." 

Susann is a flamboyant, talent-
les , show business has been until 
she meets manager and publicist 
Irving Mansfield ( athan Lane), 
who believes he is the one who 
can make Susann's dreams of 
world fame come true. 

With Susann's acting career 
shot, Mansfield gets the wild 
notion that his new wife should 
write a book. Despite never hav-
ing written a book before, Susann 
knew one thing that no one in the 
Golden Era ever wrote about 
"aging stars, hopeful hookers and 
people popping pills and wind~ng 
up in the gutter" - somethmg 
that sells most books today. 

Susann begins writing, her best 
friend Florence Maybelle 
(Stockard Channing) and her hus-
band at her side for inspiration 
and advice. Finishing the sordid 
book, titled Valley of tile Dol/s, 
Susann begins her search for a 
publisher. Rejections from .several 
publishing giants such as Simon & 
Schuster, who trunk the book is 
risque, send Susann's book to 
publisher Henry Marcus Gohn 
Cleese) who assigns "tight-ass, 
smart cookie" editor Michael 
Hastings to clean up the book 

(David Hyde Pierce). 
Susann's journey from starry-

eyed to stardom is both fantastic 
and funny. Midler, for whom the 
script was tailored, plays Susann 
like no one else. Both Mike Lobell, 
the movie's producer, and director 
Andrew Bergman refer to Midler 
as "bigger than life" and "outra-
geous," a perfect combin~tion for 
Susann, who shows everyone that 
attitude is more important than 
talent. 

Lane, as the supportive hus-
band and successful schmoozer, 
creates a seemingly perfect bal-
ance of logic and business sense 
with Midler's eccentric and ambi-
tious character. 

John Cleese and David Hyde 
Pierce, as the publisher and editor, 
respectively, are polar oppo ites. 
Cleese becomes excited about the 
smut in Valley of thr Dol/s while 
Pierce's sheltered upper-class 
character cringes at the notion that 
such a book that was obviously 
trash to him was about to be pub-
lished and touted a the next best 
seller. Cleese's character is memo-
rable, but unfortunately his 
appearances on screen were limit-
ed. Pierce's innocent looks and 
shocked expressions spawned 
from the blatant actions of Midler, 
more than made up for his limited 
dialogue in the movie. Fortunate-
ly, Pierce begins to let go and starts 
to act more relaxed as he gets used 
to Midler's loud and confident 
personality. . 

Midler 's character, Jackie 
Susann, also inspired those watch-
ing the movie that anyone can 
have the drive and ambition to 
make their .mark on society before 
they leave the world. idler says 
that she understands the "drive 
and the ambition and the idea that 
you don't want to have lived with-
out leaving a mark, no matter how 
small." The movie offers reassur-

ance to anyone in the audience 
who is aspiring to become famous 
and leave their own mark in the 
world. 

The story line itself wasn't very 
complex but the clever dialogue 
and the fabulous interaction in the 

screenplay between the charac-
ters, was brought to life by every-
one in the movie and made "Isn't 
She Great" a refreshing respite 
from the usual, dull movies that 
are billed as comedies. 

The movie could have used 

more of John Cleese but neverthe-
less it's a wonderful comedy 
where love plays second fiddle to 
the goal of becoming famou~. 
And with the cozy lounge-musIC 
style of Burt Bacharach, the ~ovie 
is well worth the price of a ticket.

18 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian Thursday, January 27, 2000 

UCSD has one of the most fanIoua 
histories in the nation when it comes to 
the college surfing !ICene. With thn!e 
national championships WIder its belt, 
UCSD is a feared competitor in the 
sport and is always a threat to its com-
petitors. 

UCSD lived up to its famed ~ 
lion with an overall second place finish 
at the Cardiff Seaside Reef Competition. 
After a few dry years for UCSD, tile 
event jump-started the season, showing 
that the team is a force to be rec:JconeCI 
with this year. 

The waves certain1v weren't ideal for 
competition, but uest> adapted its style 
to make them rideable. 

Danny O'ConneJ was the top finfsl\er 
for the UCSD men, finishing in second 
place overall. Team Captain Garth 
Engelhom came in at fifth place. 

The women were led Oy defending 
national champion Holly Beck, who 
came in at second place. Beck suzely 
would have claimed first place but a 
controversial call by the judges disqual-
ified one of her waves. 

With the momentum of this finish, 
UCSD will hit the waves next on Feb. 6 
at Ventura Surfers Point. This will be 
UCSD's third competition of the year 

Lut weekend tile UCSD women's 
uUimate di8c team traveled north to

Men Lose Three On the Road HOOPS: Tritons will be red 
hot for Spirit Night TURMOIL: Tritons blow a halftime lead versus Monterey Bay as their record falls to 4-17 

By ROBERT RJLTON 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team's recent took a road trip 
that is best described as a magi-
cal misery tour. 

The Tritons took a three-day 
trip to the north and lost three 
games in as many days. 

Despite the poor results, 
UCSD had two decent games 
during the stretch. 

The Tritons fell to UC Santa 
Cruz 72-68 on Sunday and nar-
rowly lost to Cal State Monterey 
Bay 74-72 on Monday. 

Struggling through its final 
game of the trip, a tired and 
weary Triton team was blown 
out by Holy Names 89-67 on 
Tuesday. 

The Tritons had a fine team 
effort on Sunday in their close 
loss to the Banana Slugs. 

UCSD was down 39-33 at the 
half, but scrapped back to lose by 
only four. 

The team could not overcome 
UC Santa Cruz's 49 percent field 
goal shooting and its own mea-
ger 21 percent shooting effort 
from three-point land.

UCSD's Clark Goolsby - the 
starting forward - led all scor-
ers with 22 points and six 
rebounds. Starting guard Sam 
Higgins chipped in with 
17 points and starting 
center Nick 
Chris t ensen 
added 10 points. 

The Banana 
Slugs had four players in 
the double-digits en-route 
to their victory. 

Chad Wells scored 21 to go 
with his eight rebounds and 
teammate Jason Semanisin 
added 19. Fellow Banana Slugs 
Matt Brody and Michael 
Halligan scored 11 and 10, 
respectively. 

Next the Tritons suffered a 
heartbreaker on Monday as they 
lost to Cal State Monterey Bay. 

UCSD was down at halftime 
44-35 but wasn't ready to bE! 
counted out. 

UCSD outscored the home 
team 37-30 in the second half of 
play, but it was too little too late 
as the team eventually came up 
two pOints short. 

Monterey Bay had a stupen-
dous shooting percentage, mak-

ing 54 percent of its shots while 
connecting on half of its 14 
three-pointer at~empts as well 
as making five out of six foul 

shots. 
UCSD shot 42 per-

cent from the 
field but only 
connected on 
eight of its 30 

three-pointer attempts 
Again it was Goolsby 

leading the way, this time by 
scoring 17 pOints. Higgins 
added 16 points and 
Christensen tossed in II. 

Monterey Bay, who played 
only seven players, had an 
unstoppable force in Matt 
Da lha mer. 

Dalhamer scored 28 points 
and had eight rebounds in the 
win. Teammate Jon Breazeal 
added 13 points. 

The final game of the three-
day trip saw a tired and weary 
Triton team that was unable to 
play up to its abilities. 

UCSD held strong in the first 
half, heading into the break-
down at only 38-33. The Tritons 
fell apart in the second half, en 
route to an 89-67 loss. 

Again it was the home team's 
shooting percentage that shad-
owed UCSD's. 

Holy Names shot 53 percent 
to the Tritons' 38 percent, while 
also shooting 63 percent from 
downtown to the Tritons' 28 per-
cent. The foul-shooting percent-
age was 81 percent to 70 percent 
in favor of Holy Names. 

Higgins led the Tritons with 
18 points as well as five 
rebounds. Higgins scored 14 and 
also had five boards. Cole Miller 
added 11 points. 

Holy Names had a fine all-
around effort. David Aguilar had 
17 points and six rebounds, Brian 
Freeth scored 16 and four 
boards, Tom Shannon scored 12 
and pulled down five rebounds 
and J.D. Hawk scored 11 and 
pulled down four rebounds. 

The three losses drop UCSD's 
record to 4-17. 

The Tritons hope to recover 
from their latest slide in the best 
environments. Their next contest 
comes during the UCSD Spirit 
Night festivities as they host the 
Master 's College at 7 p.m. on 
Saturday. Be sure to bring a loud 
voice and lots of friends. 

ContInued from paCe 20 

of 27 turnovers. Triton teammates 
Genevieve Ruvald and Mindy 
Misawa led the way with six and 
five steals, respectively. 

"Our shots didn't fall ," 
Bromley said. "Luckily our 
defense held in there and won it 
for us." 

The Tritons are riding a wave 
of success. 

"Everyone is excited," 
Bromley said. "We're doing really 
well. This tough win was a wake-
up call. It was a lesson." 

Their next contest is today at 6 
p.m. when cross-town rival Point 
Lorna Nazarene pays a visit to 
RJMAC Arena. 

Point Lorna is coached by Bill 
Westphal, the brother of former 
Phoenix Suns coach Paul 
Westphal. UCSD will be facing a 
tough opponent in Point Lorna 
which began the season 2-9, but 
has been coming on strong of late 
and now holds a record of 9-LO. 

"They' re 5-2 in their confer-
ence, and they will be a big chal-
lenge for us," Malone said. 

The Tritons will then travel to 
face UC Santa Cruz and Patton 
University.

Reality 
Check I Women Down Pomona-Pitzer 
Bill . Burger 
Prepare to Have 
Some Spirit UCSD 

I know that this is Super 
Bowl weekend and YOll all 
expect me to write about that. 
Well, I am not going to. The 
game could very well be a' 
great one, but I really don't 
have anything to say about it 
that hasn't already been said. 

Instead, I want to talk about 
Spirit Night, to be held this 
Saturday at 7 p.m. in RIMAC 
arena. 

Now, I didn't go when I 
was a freshman, but I went to 
Spirit Night last year and am 
now hooked for life. Last year, 
it was on Spirit Night that 
3,713 fans - yes, that's right, 
3,713-wenttoa UCSDmen's 
basketball game. 

But this event is much more 
than just a basketball game. 
Spirit ight is one of the two 
times (with the Sun God 
Festival being the other occa-
sion) that UCSD actually 
seems like a school which stu-
dents are excited to attend. 

Last year, there was yelling, 
cheering and taunting ... it was 
great. 

To add to the excitement, 
there is a spirit competition 
between the colleges. 
Unfortunately for me and my 
fellow members of Warren 
College, Muir has won the 
competition for' the last four 
years in a row. So if you're a 
Muir student, go to Spirit 
Night and try to win the spirit 
competition for Muir's fifth 
consecutive year. And, of 
course, if you're in any other 
college, go to Spirit Night to 
help your college be the one 
that breaks Muir 's impressive 
winnin~streak. . 

Speaking of getting into the 
spirit of things, how about that 
rave in the Price Center last 
weekend? I saw a bunch of 
my friends whom I thought 
would have never been caught 
dead at a rave, dancing wilJly, 
as if they were possessed by 
some metaphysical force. 

It was an astonishing sight, 
and makes me think that this 
studious institution might 
actually have the ability to 
throw another big party. What 
do you think UCSD? 00 you 
really have it in you to jam col-
lectively for the ~nd week-
end in a row. 

In know some of you might 
be thinking about midtenns or 
papers around this time of the 
quarter, but put those aside, 
please. If you let out some 
screams this weekend, I 
promise you that you will 
have released some neeative 
energy. You will then be 
primed to do well on those 
aSSignments. 

A word of caution though. 
With Spirit Night on Saturday 
and the Super Bowl the fol-
lowing afternoon, don't 
devote yourself too much to 
consuming strong drink too 
much. 

You still have Super Bowl 
Sunday to party and be scot-
tish. So go all out this week-
end, but just make sure you're 
not too weary come Monday 
morning. 

VICTORIOUS: Despite not scoring a three, UCSD wins seventh in a row going into the weekend. 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Associate Sports Editor 

As a precursor to the upcom-
ing Spirit Night, the UCSD 
women's basketball team just 
keeps trucking right along with-
out encountering a single bump 
in the road. 

The Tritons downed Pomona-
Pitzer College 66-54 at home 
Tuesday night. 

The win improves the Triton 
record to 15-4 and is the team's 
seventh in a row, as well as the 
12th victory out of its last 13 con-
tests. 

"[Pomona-Pi tzer] is a good 
team," Triton Head Coach Judy 
Malone said, referring to her 
team's opponents. "They' re 4-12, 
but half of their team was over-
seas studying abroad last 
semester at the beginning 
of the sea-
son." 

U C S D 
jumped 
ahead early 
with a 6-0 lead, but the 
Sagehens battled back to 
pull the score to 8-7. That is as 
close as the visitors would get. 
The Tritons pulled out to a 28-17 . 
advantage and entered halftime 
up 32-23. 

Pomona-Pitzer made a push in 
the second half and pulled the 
score to 36-30. 

UCSD stretched its lead out 
again with the help of six points 
from star player Kimberly Neal, 
this time to 46-30, but the scrappy 
Sagehens battled back and pulled 
the score within six points at 50-
44 with just over eight minutes to 
go. 

The Tritons would have noth-
ing of a Pomona-Pitzer comeback 
and finished the game on top at 
66-54. 

The star of the game was the 
Tritons' Neal, who led all scorers 
with 18 points in only 19 min-
utes. Neal also added seven 
rebounds as !lhe came off the 

bench, but her evening was cut 
short when she went down with 
an ankle injury with four min-
utes to play. 

"She sprained her left ankle, 
the same one she injured abut a 
month ago," Malone said of the 
dominant Neal. 

Also for the Tritons, Nicholle 
Bromley scored 12 points while 
teammate Kate Turnbull scored 
eight and deaned the glass with 
13 rebounds. Fellow Triton 
Ashley Kokjohn added seven 
points and pulled down seven 
boards. 

J"eading the Sagehens was 
Megan Gould, who scored 14 and 
had three rebounds but turned 
the ball over 11 times. 

Sagehen teammate Gre'Juana 
Dennis added 10 points while 

Tamara Zakirn scored eight 
and had eight rebound.;. 

Though 
they were 
victorious, 
the style of 
play in the 

game was clearly not 
favorable to UCSD. 

"They play a slower tempo 
than we do," Bromley said. "We 
fell into their style of play and it 
slowed us down. If we had come 
and played our game, it would 
have been different." 

The win was not a pretty one 
for the home team, as UCSD shot 
only 37 percent from the floor. A 
0-12 effort from behind the three-
point line did not help much, 
either. 

'We played a game like this 
earlier in the season against 
Claremont and didn't recover," 
Malone said in reference to 
UCSD's 67-50 loss in early 
December. "It was a struggle. We 
needed to playa game like this so 
we know we can win a game like 
this." 

The Triton defense was out-
standing as usual, forcing a total

Tennis Shows Promise but Needs Practice 
CONVlcnON: Tritons give it therr best shot on the court but lose opening match 1-6 to BYU 
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

Teams always look forward to 
the first game of the year so that 
they can get out their pre-season 
jitters out and see how much 
they have improved since 
the last season. 

The UCSD men's 
tennis team got its 
jitters out on 
Tuesday against 
Division I power-
house Brigham Young 
University. 

Head Coach Eric 
Steidlmayer anticipated a tough 
match, but hoped that the compe-
tition wo~ld nelp his players see 
where they needed to be. 

"} knew they were a level 
above us," Steidlmayer said . 
"You hope to Pi up to their 
level, but it is tou ." 

In the 'end, U D wasn't on 
BYU's level and lost the match 1-
6 despite some impressive play 
by the team. 

At number one doubles, Mike 
Rosett and Cory Moderhak were 

able to get their proset into a tie-
breaker. This was impressive con-
sidering that their opponents, 
Gert Vilrns and Damian Ward of 
BYU, are ranked in the top 20 in 
the nation in Division I doubles. 
Unfortunately, Moderhak and 

Rosett couldn't finish the 
job and eventually lost 5-

7 in the tiebreaker. 
Number two sin-

gles had freshmen 
Mike Meyer and 
Cedric Mazzara 

playing in their firsf 
collegiate doubles match 

as a team. Their inexperience 
showed at times as they came out 
flat but nonetheless showed 
flashes of brilliance that bode 
well for the future. Meyer and 
Mazzara lost 4·8 to their oppo-
nents. 

At number three doubles, Ari 
Frankel and Ryan Thompson 
were on fire and took out their 
opponents 8-5. 

"1 was really happy with our 
doubles," Steidlmayer said.
