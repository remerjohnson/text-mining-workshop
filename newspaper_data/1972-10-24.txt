McGovern Teach-ins 
A nationwide " teach-in " has been called for the ~flE'rnoon 

and evening of Oct. 25 by the Facu lty for McGovern-Shmer 
Committee Meetings will be held on 225 participating 
cam puses from coast to coast. The teach-ins will be held after 
class hours and will be organized around films supplied by 
'VIcGovern- hriver rampalgn headquarters as well as forums, 
lectures, debates and coffee hours. 

" The wide participation of 225 colleges and universities 
illustrates thaI McGovern's strength IS still overwhelming on 
the nation's campuses. The teach-1m will provide an oppor-
tunity for both faculty and students to show their support of 
enator McGovern, raise the level of debate about the issues, 

and organize get-out-the-vote drives for November 7," Ms. 
Adele Schultz and Ms. Claire White, coordinators for the 
national teach-In announced from Wa~hington, D.C.

Propositions (Modest and Otherwise) 
Greg H i ck s 

Proposition 15 would have a 
great effect on the alaries of 
persons employed by the State 
of California, in luding 
teachers dn the UC syslem. 

Thp measure would insert 
into the state constitution new 
provisions dealin1-\ with tate 
employep salaries and 
employer-employee relation-
ships. (T~e measure would not 
apply to qate employees 
elecled by Ihe people or ap-
pointed by the governor.) The 
m!!asure would reqUire Ihe 

tate Personnel Board, 
Regents of the Universlly of 
California, and the Tru~tees of 
the California tate Univer-
silies .lnd Colleges to meet 
semiannually to determine the 
average salariel paid to 
workers in Ihe sta le doing 
work similar to that done bv 
the state employees affected 
by Proposition 15. A report on 
thesE' "prevailing rates" would 
be ~ubmltted to the governor 
along with recommendalions 
as to the amount of money 
needed to bring slate 
employee salaries up to the 
prevailing rate. These findings 

and recommendations would 
be handed 10 the legislature 
by Ihe governor as part of the 
budge\. These recommenda-
1Ions could not be reduced or 
eliminated by the governor or 
bv thE' le~islature except by a 

UCSD 

two-Ihirds vOle. 
Proposit ion 15 also provides 

thaI matters of employer-
employee relations having to 
do wilh non-salary dispute be 

~ettled by independent arbi-
tration (if reque led by pither 
party) or by written agree-
ment b Iween slale appoin-
ling powers and an organl-
7atlon representing a majority 
of workers. ("Salary-related 
disputes Me dedit wiih in 
anolher section of the state 
comti tulion .) 

Radically different appraisals 
of the proposition are 
presenled by those for and 
against the measurp. Those 
who favor the measure draw 
attention to Ihe beneficial 
effects which they believe it 
would have. They state it 
would put a limit on state 
employee salaries. It is claimed 
potentially disaslrous walkout 
by slale employees (i ncluding 
prison guards, doctor~ in state 

.hospi tals, and leachers) would 
be averted by providing equal 
salaries for state employees. 

Proposition 15, they say, would 
amend inequities in employer 
salaries and set up machinery 
for dealing w1lh non-salary 
related disputes, thus averting 
walkouts. Proponents of the 
measure have also said 
Proposition 15 will raise state 
employees from the level of 
second class citizpns and pre-

Attending the Democrati Convention this summer 

provided Ihe aUlhor with many unforgettable experiences, 
Ineluding meelings with such notables as John Galbraith and 
Adlai Stevenson II. A unique experience, however, came 
amidst the bedlam of the Convention floor, where I was ap-
proached by a girl who queried, " Say, weren't you in my 
political science class la~t quarter?" Given my physical and 
menIal condition (it was the third sleepless day of that four-
day debauchery), the experience was, well , mind-boggling. 
he introduced herself as Laura Gonzalez, a McG )Vern dele-

gate from California, and I promised to interview her when 
we both got back to school. 

And I kept my promise. We met alter her night class at 
UCSD, and on Ihe way over to the Coffe Hut she filled me in 
on the vital statistics: 21, a ~enior majoring in Political Science 
at Third College, plans to attend law school after graduation. 

How did she become a McGovern del gate? " In rebruary, I 
was attending the state caucus, and at the last minute the 
chairman kept calling for more nominations. So, I just 
nominated myself. By the new party rules, a certain percen-
tage of the state delegation had to be Chicano ."

Precinct walking consists of walking door-
to-door in a neighborhood, generally with a 
friend . The walker has a list of registered 
voters, and their party affiliation; the 
McGovern walkers are not calling on 
Republicans, so the reception to a Demo-
cratic worker is overwhelmingly favorable.

UCSDWomen 
The women of the UCSD academic community have been 

asked to judge affirmative action on the basis of its results 
(letter from P. Saltman, n, Oct .6) . We would very much like 
10 do so, but it is exceedingly difficult if not impossible to nnd 
out exactly what has been accomplished. 

The Chancellor's Advisory Subcommittee of Affirmat ive 
Action for Women, as well as members of UCSD Women, did 
receive a list of new faculty hired between some unspecified 
starting datejlnd May 15. A breakdown of that list is shown in 
Table I. 

The chairwoman of the subcommittee has repeatedly asked 
the Chancellor's office for more up-to-date information, but 
she has not been able to obtain it. I have also asked the 
Chancellor's office for this information, but I am told (as was a 
TRITO TIMES reporter only last week) that the data are un-
available. We do, however, have a list of new Academic 
Senate members as of July 1, a summary of which is shown in 
Table II . These data should not be compared directly with the 
figures in Table .1 because 1) all new faculty members are not 
eligible for Senate membership; and 2) some new Senate 
m mbers are not new to the UCSD staff. 

evert he less, the AcademiC Senate data follow a similar 
trend with respect to the hiring of women. Revelle College 
and 510 have more than met the 25 per cent goal in the 
cnate. Female Senate membership is up this yea r to 21 from 

12, the number at this time last year, for a percentage gain of 
1.4 last Feb. 24, Chancellor McElroy set 25 per cent of new 
faculty hires as this yea r's goa l for recruitment of women 
academics. If this goal has indeed been reached or ex-
ceeded, we will be delighted to hear about it; but we will 
continue to wonder why the affirmative action coord inators 
are so secretive about their accomplishments.

fruit flies doing today ... " UCSD through 
and through ... although the minority is 
gaining ground. 

Has UCSD been the big think tank filled 
with intellectuals OR a diploma mill geared 
to subsidize " worthy" academic research? 
Although I must concede the point in 
retrospect, the undergraduate professors are 
superb. 

Although they can do little but inspire, the dehumanizing 
300-plus freshman lectures tend to downgrade the pivotal 
inspiration. How long can the professor ial quality survive 
(en masse), with such a mill ? A tricky question. Ithink not. 

The professorial research is predicted upon ..student-
ta xpayer support. The taxpayers are mad and the student 's 
sanity is declining rapidly. Therefore the bonanza appears 
headed for a major debacle. 

Generally, student objectivism has degenerated into 
emotional obscenities already. How many oldies remem-
be the Rodin-Andrea crunch in Calculus 2A? Quite blunt-
ly, Rodin was popular because it was easy. Andrea taught 
Math; Rodin gave A's-the diploma mill ground on! On 
another side light, it is most probable that most upper 
division Reve lle students (survivors) could not count the 
numbers of lectures and sections that they were unpre-
pared for (using humanities as an example : I would con-
tend 95 per cent were not prepared for the current section 
topic and 99 per cent were not prepared for the current 
lecture topic-exceptions were weekly quiz professors) . 
For a "smart," "objective" populace, the "sexism" bit is 
woefully overdone to the point where it appears that one 
can' t win . Sexist or fag? 

UCSD must have a repu tat ion among students : those 
dependable souls who keep the mill moving on. What 
kind is debatable. Recently I sat in on a group meeting of 
high school seniors about 150 miles from here. The dis-
cussion cente red on potential college choices. I almost fell 
off my chair when I heard one person say that she would 
never go to UCSD because there 's no " life." 

The general administrative concepts will probably never 
cha nge. There will always be a chancellor around who 
lacks enough scruples to facilitate the usage of student 
funds for expanding his offices. Recentl y I noticed an old 
item which says the cha ncellor had accepted a director-
ship at Southern Cali forn ia first National Bank. Funny 
thing, the last time I heard some news, that bank had NOT 
implemented an official studen t loan program (I wonder ' 
how our beloved will spend his dir ectors hip 
fees-assuming he receives the "standard " S700-p lus a 
meeting?). There will always be the GOD who decides that 
alC'Ohol is illegal on campus (for students), but for so me 
mange reason the police never raid administrative recep-
tions with champagne There wi ll always be a student body 
who doesn't care how intolerable the survival conditions 
become. 

"Times, they are a changin' (i.e. a little)". Occurrences 
HAVE changed some this year. Divine Vicar Saltman 
apologized for someth ing. The lord knows that he su re 
didn't apologile from assigning 1500 textbook pages 10 
non-biology, non-physical science majors in a previous 10-
week quarter. 

Perhaps in future months, GOD will be benevolent 
enough to bestow the public records upon th e 
public-most campus (eight Regent) administrative files 
have been classified SECRET or TOP-SECRET. In yea rs past, 
In order to see most files, you had to convi nce the relevan t 
administrator that you didn't need to see the file. Such a 
massivc declassification would appear to be a large step 
towards turning the appar nt diploma mill into an institu-
lion of higher education. That's enough opinion to last the 
year.

In less than six weeks, we, the American 
peotlle, will be chOOSing the President and 
Vice President of the United States for the 
next four years. [lut we will be doing more 
than that; we will be determining whether 
we want this country to continue along the 
course it has been taking during the past four 
years, or whether we want to restore to 
American political life its traditional values of 
democratic liberalism and social concern. 

In an America striving to realize its own 
vision of equality and liberty under the rule 
of law, the Presidency requires particular 
qualities of character, leadership and moral 
force that transcend the narrow bounds of 
personal ambition and of party politics. It 
requires a perception of the things that are 
wrong with America-politically, socially, 
economically, morally- as well as the things 
that are right; and a sense of priorities that 
gives precedence to human needs and public 
in tegrity over the panoply of wealth and the 
arrogance of power. 

The NEW YORK TIMES urges the election 
of George McGovern for President of the 
United States. We believe that Senator 
M cGovern 's approach to public questions, 
his humanitarian philosophy and humane 
scale of va lues, his courage and his forth-
rightness ca n offer a new kind of leadership 
in American political life. We believe he can 
restore a sense of purpose to the American 
people as a whole, a sense of participation to 
their component parts and a sense of integri-
ty to their Government. 

I n th ese respects, it seems to us, the 
Presidency of Richard M . Nixon has largely 
failed.

Government as the Department of Justice 
and the Supreme Court. In many of its social, 
economic and fi sca l policies; in lax sta ndards 
of probity and truthfulness in government; in 
favoritism toward special interests; in its 

addiction to secrecy; in its disregard of civil 
liberties and constitutional rights, the Nixon 
Administration has been a failure . 

President Nixon has shown himself willing 
to exacerbate America 's racial divisions for 
purely politi cal purpo ses; he ha s 
countenanced and encouraged an ominous 
erosion of individual rights and First Amend-
ment freedoms, and has demonstrated his 
indifference to such dangers by deliberately 
selecting Spiro T. Agnew as his potential suc-
cessor to the Presidency. Protected by the 
White House curtain, he has stood above the 
polit ical battle as the odor of corruption and 
of sleazy campaign practices rises above the 
Washington battlefield. 

A McGovern administration, the TIMES 
believes, would reverse the unmistakable 
drift in Washington away from government 
of, by and for the people. It is undeniable 
that since his nomination Senator McGovern 
has been on the defensive, partly because of 
the Eagleton episode, partly because of ill-
considered comments on specific points that 
he has subsequently modified or corrected, 
and partl y because of the confused manage-
ment of his own cam pa ign. But on his record , 
and on what he has consistently stood for in 
his years of office-a consis tency in striking 
contrast to that of his opponent-it is clear 
that Mr. McGovern will fight for effective and 
necessary reforms in American social, 
political and economic institutions, 

What this election comes down to is a 
decision on the direction in which the United 
States is going to move for the next four 
years. 

Are we going to continue to pursue a 
foreign policy that , for all its success in cer-
tain areas, is essentially based on military 
su premacy, on a strident nationalism and on 
a cynical power game that could alienate this 
country from substantial segments of the 
international community? 

Are we going to continue to pursue a 
domestic policy that, in its fundamentals, is 
contemptuous of civil liberties, oblivious of 
deep social conflicts and racial and economic 
cleavages in the cities of America, and 
oriented toward that very "military-indus-
trial complex" against which President Eisen-
hower perceptively warned us so many years 
ago? 

On vi rtuall y every major Issue from the war 
to taxes, from education to environment, 
from civil liberties to nat ional defense, Mr. 
McGovern-faltering though many of his 
statements have been- seems to us to be 
moving with the rig!-t priorities, with faith in 
the common man, and within the democratic 
framework. While this newspa per does not 

necessarily accept his program in every detail 
as he has thus far ou tl ined it or as the 
Democratic platform has structured it, we are 
convi nced that the direction of American 
policy in the next four years would be in safer 
hands under a McGovern -Shriver administra-
tion than under the present regime. 

There can be no doubt that Mr. McGovern 
is now far behind in the Presidl'nt ial race. But 

If he succeeds in these next few weeks in 
getting his baSIC philosoph y' of democratic 
government across to the electorate, a 
philosophy that rejects the meretricious 
appeal of his opponents, S nator McGovern 
may yet touch a chord in the American voter 
that will respond to his own practical vision of 
an American society that cares and an Ameri-
can democracy that works. 

LETTERS Ttt THE Eltlnll 
Miles Review 
Wrong 

Editor, 
The review of the Miles 

Davis concert by Gary Leonard 
was an incredible put-down of 
the man who continues to 
revolutionize contemporary 
jazz with every note he plays. 
Th(> concert at Civic Theater 
was everything and more than 
I had anticipated - a restless 
creative genius at work, 
already casting aside the com-
mercially successfull "rock-
jazz" sound of " Bitches' Brew" 
and raising his genre to new 
levels of complexity and ex-
pressionism. To describe this 
music as "fitting all the posi-
tive hip cliches of the past five 
years" IS utterly ridiculous -
this music "fits" nothing of the 
past , including, apparently, 
the outmoded sensibilities of 
Mr. leonard. The failure to 
grasp immediately new 
material by an artist who has 
consistently forged ahead of 
his contemporaries is under-
standable, but to flatly reject 
that material is unforgiveable. 

I also disagree with the 
reviewer 's comments regar-
ding the "nonexistent rapport 
between Davis and the 
crowd." The intensity of this 
man and his music generated 
an electricity that I have rarely 
experienced at a live concert. 
There was, in particular, a very 
special rapport with the black 
audience that the white 
members, including myself, 
could doubtless not fully ap-
preciate - a rapport which 
was embodied in the ex-
change of glances which took 
place between Miles and a 
single black man who 
wandered from his seat to 
stand at the front of the stage 
for a few minutes during the 
first set. "An Evening with 
Miles Davis" was an evening I 
will not soon forget.

Standing In 
Edilor: 

I would like to commend 
Dr. Dijkstra's efforts to ex-
pand the study of women in 
literature (see n Tues., Oct. 
10). However, I am quite 
puzzled by his claim "to be 
'standing in' ... until there is a 
woman on the staff who could 
handle such a course." The 
fact is that a general lit course 
(lit 152) about women taught 
by a woman ( athalie Brown 
of the French section) has 
already been developed and 
presented last Spring Quarter 
(in addition to an earlier Fall 
Quarter course about women 
in French lit) Since there was 
no publicity about the course 
at that time, let me point out 
that " the modest beginning" 
referred to by Dr Dijkstra has 
already been made, and by a 
woman. 

This probably unintentional 
oversight points to a much 
larger problem. The same 
Issue of the TRITON TIMES 
contains an article about the 
drastic and illegal under-
representation of women In all 
departments of the Univer-
sity. Even HEW says that no 
one can tell us anymore that 
we have to wait until women 
are "capable of handling" un-
iversity courses. However, the 
problem won't be remedied 
by simply hiring more women, 
by adjusting percentages. We 
must make sure that, once 
hired, women faculty are fully 
represented within the depart-
ment. 11 doesn't make sense to 
hire the proper quota of 
women, and then have men 
"stand in" for them

MUSEUM MECHANIZATION 

Machine-created images by English artist 
Harold Cohen are being presented at the La 
Jolla ,museum of Contemporary Art through 

ov. 12. ln executing a sophisticated program 
Harold Cohen has utilized a Pack ard 2100-A 
compute r which in turn operates a 
mechanical drawing machine to produce an 
inter sting array of drawings. 

Each day the mu cum's curatorial staff 
selects one of the 10 drawings that is 
produced and it is hung on the blue walls of 
the Fayman Gallery. At thE' close of thE' 
exhibit a total of 26 drawings will be on 
display. The exhibition is a continual process, 
not just the drawings. 

The pro(edure Harold Cohen has used to 
produce his work is known as "tree search" 
rn computer jargon. The computer IS directed 
to proceed through 10 numbers from one to 
zero without ever crossrng over an existing 
!rne. 

Regarded as one of the ranking members 
of a generation of talented English artists, 
Harold Cohen's paintings have beeen widely 
exhibited both in this country and abroad. In 
1969 he came to UCSD as a visiting lecturer 
and then decided to stay on as a resident 

member of the facu lty. 
Though no two are alike, the drawings in 

some respects are vel y similar. All are com-
posed of lines that seem to mea nder across 
the paper to a particular random point and 
then move into a different direction . The 
overall effect is similar to a geometric design 
which cou ld have been drawn by a young 
child, however, in a much more complicated 
sense. One intere ting observation about the 
pictures ' lines is that not one of them is 
perfectly straight. 

Harold Cohen has stated that "this is not an 
exhibition about mechanical devices," but 
rather it is what the artist "has in mind, nol 
what he has in his fingers." In other words 
Harold Cohen has made a decision about the 
nature of work he wishes the computer to do 
and has programmed it to be accomplished 
his facination with the capabilrty of com-
puters to take "primitive decision-making 
functions" and transform them into 
"compll'l( functions bearing strange and 
remarkable resemblances to human logical 
processe " has led him to use these processes 
in art oriented actlvi(rl's.

ORONTEA 
The eventeenth-cen tury allegorical opera 

"Orontea" by Antonio Cesti, conducted by 
UCLA' Jan Popper, will be presented at 
UCSD one night onl y, Saturday, O ct. 26, at 
6.30 p.m. 

The performance, which is free and open 
to the public, is being presented under the 
auspices of the University of California Inter-
campus Cultural Exchange Program. It will be 
held in the Recital Hall, 409 Matthews Cam-
pus. 

Although Antonio Ces t i (1623-1669) is 
lemembered today principally for his festival 
work, "II Pomo d'oro," in his own day he was 
recognized as a master of the lyric chamber 
can tdta as well as one of the most popular 
composers of the operatic stage 

"Orontea" was his first opPra and had its 
pr 'miere at the Teatro 55. Apostoli, Venice, 
in 1649. Taken into the repertory of the Febi 
Armonici, Italy'S first travelrng opera com-
pany, it soon made ItS way to several other 
Italian cities. During the next 15 years it was 
given at least 23 different productions in Italy, 
G rmany and Austria. 

The success of "Orontea" rests upon its 
~parkling comedy, its memorable melodies 
and its striking dramatic and musical 
characterizations Andrea Cicognini's libret-
to of "Orontea," reflecting th n current 
fashions, drew upon elements of both the 
popular "commedia deWarte" and contem-
porary Spanish theater. Cestl's setting also in-
corporated new attitudes and ideas. He ca re-
fully constructed hiS music so that the 
moments of reflection, set as arias and duets, 
more nearly balan(ed those ot action. The 
melodies of the arias are tuneful, simple and 
graceful, yet deSigned to characterize both 
mUSically and psychologically the personali-

tle~ and emotiom of th£' characters on stage. 
The confli('t bl'tween love and duty, the 

ptrrnal trrdngle of lovp, an older woman's 
pursuit of happiness with a young man, a 
drunken ~rrvant's mompnts of truth, all arc 
port raved so vividly that they ran still cap-
turt' Ihe attention of a modrrn audience 

In recent times the score of "Oronted" wa~ 
th0ught to havc bp!'n Imt, though some of its

Water Polo Splashes 
Throug h Long Weekend 

It might well be 
[('membered as the weekend 
of Ihl' diastrous doublp-
hE'dder. Two days, two games, 
and 10 get right 10 the point, 
IWO losses for the problem-
plagued polo people. Th!' un-
'ettling details go 10mPlhing 
like this ... 

Friday thE' local Iplashers 
snoo/ed their way up to long 
Beach to playa rather interest-
i ng concOCtion of L. B. frosh 
J.\ 's With a sprinkle of varsity 

playf'r~ to add le~t To mak!' 
,ure things would go well, 
they also added their own 
home grown refs . taking the 
fro<;h coach, sticking J whistle 
In hiS mouth, painting stripes 
on hiS back, putting a patch 
mer one eye to Insure seeing 
only half of the fouls, and 
stdmpint "OffiCIal Apprentice 
RE'f" on his forehead. Such 
was thE' setting for what shall 
herpaftcr be rememb red as 
the' Long Bitch game of 72. 

Perh pas t he lesson to be 
learned from this game per-
l.llm to resrliance or finesse rn 
thE' face of adversity. From the 
oprning whistle it was clear 
Ihat pverythrng was adverse, 
and before the first quarter 
Cd me to an !'nd mor than one 
flIt had found its mark on an 
opponent's chops. To give you 
an Idea 01 how the Triton luck 
Wd, running, the guys they 
cho,e to punch had braces, 
sorl of like punching a 
hJcksaw. 

Tht' pnd of the first period 
found the stOre 4-0 L.B., the 
most upsetting part not bing 
the score, but rather the In-
.lhi!rty of the team to adjust to 
thr unusually bruw I playrng 
ilnd rpffing. This problem has 
plagued Ihe team most of the 

frr~t third of the season. 
Perhaps it ,unk in, or was 
b!'atpn in , that goals are 

~dined more by gutl than 
~rlpe~, but only time will tell . 

The end of the game saw a 
loul called on the average of 
onl!' ('very 20 seconds, and 

Lon~ Beach had made their 
pOints. mainly that they cou ld 
heat up people beller th.ln we 
(ould and that indeed the now 
Infamous umber 24 (3 in 
white) I> inde d a cream puff. 
The scoring found si~ 
I CSD'ers with a goal, which is 

not much solace when four-
teen of the opposition claim 
the saml' ac('ompli~hment.

r('ward for Intrrcolll'giate par-

was up. In fact, a lot of them 
had been up all night 

Thp game promised to be 
even. They weren't much 
bigger than us, weren't much 
faster, and were nearly as in-
jured Even was perhaps an 
understatempnt, as neither 
team ev('f led by more than a 
goal First quarter found the
