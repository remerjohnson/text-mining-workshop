UCSD couple joins 
thousands in gay marriage 

By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

At least three UCSD affiliates 
are among the more than 3,400 
couples who have obtained same-
sex marriage licenses in San 
Francisco since the city began 
offering them to gay couples on 
Feb. 12. 

Ali Liebegott and Anna Joy 
Springer, both lecturers in the lit-
erature department, arrived at 
San Francisco City Hall with 
another friend, a UCSD graduate 
student, and her partner at 6 a.m. 
on Feb. 19. 

"I think we just saw it in the 
paper and we kept thinking every 
day that it was going to end," 
Liebegott said. "And then, we 
heard that it was going to be 
going through that Friday, so we 
just decided - might as well try 
to make it before Friday." 

The two couples joined hun-
dreds of others in line hours 

before San Francisco's City Hall 
opened. About 17 hours after 
leaving San Diego, the couples 
were married in a double ceremo-
ny. 

"Different people were doing 
sweet things like bringing cookies 
to the people in line," Liebegott 
said. "People were calling up 
florists from allover the country 
and just saying, 'deliver these to 
people in line. '" 

Liebegott and Springer met 
while touring together with a 
band called Sister Spit. They have . 
been together for five years. 

Liebegott said the crowd of 
people waiting for marriage 
licenses included many couples 
who have been together for 
decades. 

Every time a couple got a 
license, those waiting in line 
would clap and cheer as the new-
lyweds left City Hall.

UC to turn 
away 

eligible 
students 

By GAlw FAURE 
News Editor 

The University of California 
announced Feb. 26 that Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's proposal to 
reduce UC freshman enrollment by 
10 percent due to budget cuts will 
force the university to turn away sev-
eral thousand eligible ~tudents. 

Although not all campuses have 
finished their admissions process, 
UC officials are expecting about 
3,200 applicants, or 10 percent of 
the batch of eligible students, to be 
offered admission contingent upon 
first completing two years of 
coursework at a community college. 
As an incentive, community college 
fees will be waived.

Striking and locked-out 
Southern California grocery work-
ers voted overwhelmingly to return 
to work and end the longest and 
largest supermarket strike in histo-
ry, union officials said. 

Almost 70,000 picketing 
employees chose to approve a con-
tract offer from three of the nation's 
largest grocers by an 86-percent 
margin during two days of voting, 
five locals of the United Food and 
Commercial Workers announced in 
a statement late on Feb. 29. 

"Workers in this labor dispute 
were fighting to protect affordable 
health care, their pensions and job 

security," they stated. "These three 
goals were accomplished in the 
new agreement indicating the 
workers' struggle and sacrifice 
were worthwhile." 

However, the new contract 
includes cuts in benefits, Reuters 
reported. Under the deal, workers 
will be required to pay a portion of 
health care costs, though less than 
the companies had asked in a propos-
al prior to the strike. In addition, gro-
cers will establish a two-tier wage 
system, with lower maximum pay 
and pension benefits for new hires, 
and cut employer contributions to 
pensions of current workers. 
Returning employees will also 
receive a bonus for every hour they 
worked in the year prior to the strike. 

Albertsons, Vons and Ralphs 
praised the agreement in a joint 
statement on Feb. 26, though they 
said that it required tough choices 
on both sides. 

''This labor dispute has been dif-
ficult for everyone involved - our 
employees, our customers and our 
companies - and we look forward 
to its conclusion," the grocers stated. 
"[The] agreement squarely addresses 
the challenging health care costs and 
competitive issues we face." 

Workers voted to go on strike 
against Vons on Oct. II, 2003 and 
the other two companies locked out 
their workers the next day, as part 
of a deal between the three to bar-

UCSD Cares campaign hits 

campus March 1 
Organizations will showcase service pro-

jects and recruit volunteers for community ser-
vice projects on Library Walk from March 1 to 
March 5 for the third annual UCSD Cares cam-
paign. Sponsored by Associated Students, 
Student Organizations & Leadership 
Opportunities and UCSD Bookstore, student 
organizations will be tabling to have volunteer 
sign-ups and to ask for donations for local char-
ities. 

Some of the services that students can join 
include Habitat for Humanity and UCSD 
Student Life, which are asking students to 
donate 10 inches of hair to benefit Locks of 
Love, a program aimed at helping children 
with rare hair loss syndromes. Stylists will also 
be available all week for free to cut and style 
.hair. 
• The Premedica l Association Students for 
Services is asking for toiletries, canned food 
and clothes to be donated to various charities. 
Intemational House Cares will try to raise 
money for a trip to a Tijuana orphanage and 
supplies that they can donate to the dlildren. 
There will also be a dunk tank where students 
can dunk their resident dean and resident advi-
sors. 

Students Against Animal Suffering will also 
have an information table on Seeds for Change 
Humane Education and additional information 
on animal protection issues. Other organiza-
tions asking for donations include the Alumni 
Association, who is hold ing its second annual 
Kiss the Pig fund raiser where prominent stu-
dents and administrators will kiss a pig for 
every $25 the organization receives for dia-
betes research. 

Students can also round their purchases to 
the nearest dollar at UCSD Bookstore, and the 
change will go to local charities. UCSD 
Bookstore will also have a window display for 
food and clothing donations throughout the 
week. 

The campaign week first began in 2001 
after Sept. 11 when the UCSD community 
rallied to give to local charities. Last year, over 
40 student organizations were able to raise 
more than $3,000 for va rious charities in 
addition to clothin& food and other donated 
items. 

A list of activities planned by participating 
organizations is available at

According to UCSD history 
professor Michael Bernstein, there 
are other ways to combat the bud-

"The obvious answers to differ-

to raise taxes and/or to make other 
cuts in areas that have been more 
protected in the budget cuts, such 
as the Department of Corrections," 
Bernstein said. 

According to both Bernstein 
and Kousser, the fail ure of the

affect the UC system by forcing 
more cuts to be made. 

Bernstein believes that these 
cuts could be so drastic as to affect 
the capability of the UC system to 
adhere to the California Master 
Plan for Higher Education. 

Kousser said that although the 
UC system will receive immediate 
benefits from the bond, it will also 
be affected in the long run by the 
bond. The long-term effects will 
not necessarily be positive, The 
measure will, over the next 10 years 
as it is repaid, take money away 
from the rebuilding and creation of 
California's infrastructure and the 
development of public programs, 
including the UC system, Kousser 
said.

n.Edwards 
rings-nope 

S en. J o hn Edwards (D-N.C.) has offered a refresh-ing voice to the 2004 pri -
mary campaign, exuding confi-
dence, morality and optimism 
thar the D~mocrats must play up 
when they fight for the Oval 
Office as well as seats in the 
109th Congress [hi ovem ber. 
Since George W. Bush took 
office in 200 l, Democratic dis-
sen t to his policies has been 
attacked as socially immoral, soft 
on the faceless War on 
Terrorism, and intrusive in fiscal 
matters. 

But Edwards, a dark horse 
before the first primary contests 
took place, has charged against 
these stigmas undaunted - out-
lasting all others to be the last 
remaining serious threat to fron -
trunner Sen. John Kerry (D-
Mass .). And on March 2, 
Edwards deserves the support of 
UCSD voters selecting a 
Democratic nominee when the 
California primary election rolls 
th rough as pa rt of "Super 
Tuesday." 

Edwards, age SO, has an 
American story much different 
than si lver-spooners Bush and 
Kerry. Raised modestly in a rural 
town in North Carolina, Edwards 
was the first in his family to attend 
college. He worked his way 
through college and law school -
both at public institutions. He 
later went on to practice law 
(where he met wife Elizabeth), 
and his courtroom success in 
tighting powerful insurance com-
panies on behalf of families earned 
him a great deal of respect in the 
legal and local communities. 

Enough respect in North 
Carolina, in fact, to, in 1998, 
unseat the Jesse Helms political 
machine when he ran for U.S. 
Senate as an inexperienced 
Democrat in a largely conserva-
ti ve Slate. His prowess caught the 
cye of his party's leadership, and 
he has continued to be rewarded 
with new committee assignments 
in his first term. Edwards cur-
re n tI y serves on the Sena te 

Committees on Intelligence; 
Small Business; Judiciary; and 
Health, Education, Labor and 
Pensions. As a member of the 
Select Committee on 
Intelligence, he has worked to 
pressure the administration on an 
exit strategy for Iraq and was on 
the first congressional delegation 
to Afghanistan after the Taliban 
fell . 

But while no President has 
been elected straight from the 
halls of Congress since John F. 
Kennedy - largely due to the .

MONDAY, MARCH I, 2004 

AYOR _______ _ 

Peter Q. Davis 
San Diegans will be called upon to 

make a familiar decision for mayor 
this year; Port Commissioner Peter 
Q. Davis, County Supervisor Ron 
Roberts and environmental designer 
Jim Bell each ran unsuccessfully 
against Mayor Dick Murphy in 2000. 
After four trying years under Murphy, 
voters would be wise not to make the 
same mistake in 2004. 

Davis offers San Diego the most 
promising choice for mayor. His 
financial expertise is just what the 
doctor ordered for a city that is 
increasingly becoming mired in fiscal 
crises. With a pension fund deficit, a 
confrontation wi th the Chargers and 
fire preparedness issues all looming in 
the face of increased budget cuts, 
Davi possesses the best qualifications 
to guide the city through the impor-
tant years ahead. 

Davis touts public safety as his pri-
mary concern; this is more than wel-
come given Murphy's bungling of the 
San Diego fires and aftermath. While 
his calls for increasing police, fire and 
lifeguard funding would require dras-
tic reprioritizing, Davis seems to be 
the on.ly candidate commanding the 
responsible, fiscal leadership neces-
sary to do 50 - exactly the brand of 
leadership that City Hall lacks. A for-
mer banker and head of the Centre 
City Development Corporation, 
Davis has led in both the public and 
private sectors, most notably in the 
redevelopment of downtown San 
Diego over the last 25 years. 

On the issues, he is adamantly 
opposed to further under-funcling 
San Diego's pension system on the 
grounds that future generations will 
have to make up for a potential $2 bil- . 
lion deficit. Also, he seems the right 
person to negotiate a deal with Alex 

Spanos and devise a plan to not only 
keep taxpayers from footing the bill 
for a new Chargers stadium, but also 
turn the venture into a revenue-gen-
erator. 

Like his opponents, Davis of 
course identifies traffic, crime and 
beach and bay pollution as areas for 
improvement, but he alone seems to 
possess the prowess and reason to 
tackle these issues and at the same 
time balance the city budget. Unlilte 
Murphy, whose "10 Goals" agenda 
has proved pretty fruitless, Davis 
stresses £Iexibi lity in undertaking such 
issues. 

Although he supports Proposition 
C to raise revenue for the city, Davis 
recognizes its flaws, calling the tran-
sient occupancy tax inflexible and "a 
terrible deal." He has also proven to 
some degree that he is .an environ-
ment-friendly developer, concerned 
with air and water pollution and 
urban sprawl. 

Though a Republican, Davis 
seems progressive enough; he has 
supported needle-exchange programs 
and the medical use of marijuana, and 
told the San Diego Unioll-Tribune this 
month that he would support a self-
funding grant for the Boy Scouts in 
Balboa Park but not public subsidy. 

The lone Democrat in the race, 
Jim Bcll, is a compelling candidate 
running on a very worthy ecologi-
cal self-sufficiency platform. 
However, the opening claims on 
his campaign Web site ("We live on 
spaceship Earth. We are its astro-
nauts.") are probably enough to 
keep anyone in City HaJJ from tak-
ing him seriously, even if voters do . 
Roberts has years of experience in

Rosario Marin 
The opportunity to challenge two-term incum-

bent Barbara Boxer is on the line March 2 when 
Republican voters nominate a candidate to represent 
the party in November's race for the U.S. Senate. 
When Republicans cast their votes, they should con-
sider Rosario Marin as their best shot for defeating 
Boxer. 

Marin emigrated from Mexico with her family 
when she was 14. She lived a blue-collar life growing 
up and worked her way through college at CSU Los 
Angeles. She recently left national office after serving 
as the 41 st U.S. treasurer, where she was the highest-
ranking Latino in the Bush administration. 

The face of California - now one-third Latino 
- is changing, and the state's leaders in the U.S. 
Congress and the state legislature have re£lected that. 
Our current senators are two wealthy, liberal white 
women from the Bay Area: perhaps a change of per-

Ralph Denney 
Four Republicans are competing for the 39th dis-

trict state senate seat, but only one deserves the nom-
ination: Ralph Denney. Denney faces stiff competi-
tion from Larry Stirling, who has spent tens of thou-
sands more on his campaign than the rest of the can-
didates and whose endorsements include two former 
California governors and UC Regent Ward 
Connerly, but Denney'S priorities speak higher than 
Stirlings friends and funding. 

Denney understands the importance of public 
education and hopes to promote an understanding of 
the correlation between a strong educational system 
and winning the fights against dnlgs, violence and 
poverty in California. He stands for spending more 
money per student by capping noninstructional 
administrative expenses. 

To address California's water needs, Denney also 
supports developing inexpensive desalination tech-
nologies in Southern California while pressuring 
Sacramento to encourage conservation by ending

spective for the statc's most powerful national office

Marin has many flaws in her policy stances now-
no more than any of the otl1er nine Republicans run-
ning - but she has shown that she is £Iexible in her 
positions based on the experiences she has. A case in 
point is her once-anti-abortion stance, which she 
changed after seeing her own maternal challenges 
(she had a miscarriage) and those of the pregnant 
women she counseled. Another of Marin's childrcn 
was born with Down Syndrome, spurring her to pub-
licly advocate on behalf of disabled people. Her lead-
ership in this arena earned her a position with former 
Gov. Pete Wilson. 

She is against entitlement programs - and dri-
vers licenses for that matter - for illegal immigrants.

wasteful flood irrigation practices. 
Denney looks at long-term solutions for health 

care problems, which he says are only worsened by 
trimming important programs, such as infant and 
child health care, to save money in the short term. 
H e advocates re-establishing more inexpensive pub-
lic health clinics to provide basic health care and 
treatment so that underprivi leged Californian arc 
kept healthy. 

Republicans from the 39th district should elect 
Denney to give a regular citizen with practical ideas a 
chance to champion greater efficiency in the core 
responsibilities of California's government - public 
education, public safety and public health.

6 OPINION 

SSEMBlY DISTRICT 7L 
Tricia Hunter best 

choice for Republicans 
Registered nurse Tricia 

Hunter is a satisfactOry choice in 
the Republjcan primary for state 
a sembly district 76. Hunter held 
the position between 1989 and 
1992, and despite failing to win 
an assembly seat several times 
since, has over a decade in com-
bined political experience as a 
State Board of Nursing appointee 
and lobbyist. 

However, it is Hunter's sole 
opponent, former Fox 6 
reporter Bill Stamps, who makes 
dlis endorsement easy. Stamps, 
the California Republican 
Assembly endorsee, takes a 
troublesomely hard-line conser-
vative stance on several issues; 
he ' has signed the intoleran t 
"marriage protection pledge," is 
pro-life and supports strength-
ening the border. 

While there may be some 
validity to Stamps' claims that 
Hunter has dodged controver-
sial i sues in her campaign, her 
focus on more mainstream 
issues such as rising housing 
COStS, fiscal responsibility and 
affordable health care make her 
a much more appealing candi-
date. 

Hunter's experience in the 
hea lth care business gives her 
wlique insight into this often-
problematic i sue. IIer political 
aspirations, she claims, actually 
grew out of a first-hand knowl-

edge of California's health care 
problems, specifically the grow-
ing influence of profit-minded 
special interests and health care 
providers in Sacramento. 
Hunter's recognition of the need 
to make health care an affordable 
service for all Californians is par-
ticularly promising, especially 
cOIning from a fiscal conserva-
tive. 

Although her general elec-
tion bid for assembly in 1996 
was marked by claims of car-
petbagging and controversy 
over her ties to tobacco compa-
nies - her Democratic oppo-
nent Howard Wayne deemed 
her the Tobacco Nurse for 
accepting contri butions from 
the industry - Hunter is still 
the most qualified and trust-
worthy Republican vying for 
the seat. 

Granted, Hunter's conserva-
tive side shines through in her 
"no new taxes" pledge and sup-
port for No Child Left Behjnd-
style accountability in educa-
tion, but her promise to be an 
independent and nonpartisan 
representative for the citizens of 
the 76th District is welcome 
nonetheless.

-----PROPS. A, B, C _______ _ 

o 
Proposition A, otherwise 

known as the Rural Lands 
Initiative, is a local measure 
that, if approved, will require 
newly subdivided parcels on 
approximately 694,000 acres of 
rural land in northern and east-
ern San Diego County to be 
developed in increments of 40, 
80 or 160 acres. This measure 
limits growth in rural lands, 
shifts development to already-
congested cities, and will be 
detrimental to San Diego if 
passed. 

For six years, San Diego 
County officials have been in 
the process of writing a gener-
al plan for development in 
unincorporated areas of the 
county. 

Development ·in rural lands 
has proceeded under current 
law, and Proposition A was 
proposed to enact new rules to 
protect the environment in 
such areas. Proposition A 
requires changes to zoning law 
to limit the growth in northern 
and eastern San Diego county, 
and those changes can only be 
made by voter approval. 

Environmental impact 
reports and necessary city 
counei I hearings on potential 
developments will continue as 
usual procedure regardless of 
Proposition A. 

Proponents of Proposition 
A are concerned with the 
environmental impact of 
development .. under existing 
standards. They claim it will 
offer protection for over 
600,000 acres of land in rural 
areas, limit urban sprawl that 
has negative impacts on the 
environment, and protect 
water resources . Supporters 
also claim that Proposition A 
would save taxpayer dollars by 
reducing COStS of pollution 
clean up and infrastructure. 
There are significant con-
cerns, however, about San 
Diego's future if Proposition 
A is passed. 

San Diego needs to defeat 
Proposition A because it 
needs developmen t to shoul-

See A. Page 8 

o 
Proposition B would amend 

the city's charter to change (for 
the worse) the way it awards pub-
lic works construction projects. 
While the city currently awards 
contracts to the lowest bidder in a 
process where all contractors 
submit sealed bids, Proposition B 
would let the city choose a con-
struction manager, who would 
work with the city on a project 
design before proposing a maxi-
mum price, which the city could 
then accept, negotiate or reject. If 
the project goes over budget, the 
contractor would then absorb the 
extra cost. 

1bis proposition has too many 
gray areas that could easily lead to 
inefficient and costly projects. Its 
main problem is that it does not 
outline the criteria the city would 
use in selecting a construction 
manager. If the contract no 
longer goes to the lowest bidder, 
the city council would need to 
outline an extremely detailed list 
of criteria to be used in a selection 
process to assure citizens that it 
will not engage in cronyism. It 
has not done this; therefore, there 
is no guarantee that the eity 
would not be playing favorites in 
awarding its contracts. 

Proponents argue that this 
process would foster a more col-
laborative design process to min-
imize the risk of unforeseen costs. 
However, there is also no guaran-
tee that the construction manag-
er would not automatically inflate 
the cost estimate to ma ke sure 
his/her firm does not end up 
absorbing the price of unforeseen 
added costs. 

Moreover, whjle the process 
would ideally foster more effec-
tive collaboration, it could just as 
well waste the city's time if the 
council chooses to reject the 
manager 's COSt esti mate or 
accept a higher estimate than 
they really should. The con-
struction manager should stick 
to construction and stay out of 
the city's design process, and the 
city should make sure it gets its 
money's worth. 

This proposal could end up 
draining San Diego's already-
strained public works budget. 
Vote no on Proposition B. 

c~o 
Proposition C looks 

harmless enough at first 
glance. If approved, it would 
raise the local transient occu-
pancy tax, also known as 
hotel tax, by 2.5 percent, set-
ting asidc half of the tax rev-
enue to go into funds for 
firefighters, police, commu-
nity infrastructure, arts and 
culture programs, libraries 
and tourism marketing. 

There's no contesting 
that each of the beneficiaries 
of this proposition could use 
some extra funding. 
However, this proposition is 
severely flawed in its packag-
ing. It bundles funds to all 
the beneficiaries in one take-
all-or-Ieave-all package deal, 
giving little choice to voters 
who, say, would like to raise 
funds for firefighters and 
police but not for tourism 
marketing. 

Voters should take a 
dose look at the distribu-
tion of the funds. The for-
mula proposed gives, for 
every I 3 cents collected, a 
quarter of a cent to the 
police fund, half a cent to 
the libraries fund, three-
quarters of a ce nt to the 
fire-rescue fund , three-
quarters to the police 
department budget, th ~ee 
quarters to the community 
in frastructure fu nd, on e 
cent to the arts and culture 
fund and - making a giant 
leap - rwo and a half cents 
to the tourism marketing 
fund . 

Opponent argue that 
San Diego's tourism indus-
try has been forced to face 
the possibility of a raised 
TOT and that this proposi-
tion i an attempt for them 
to reap as much as they can 
out of the deal by hiding 
their touri sm fund with 
other funds voters are more 
concerned about. 

Whether or not thjs is the 
case, it is unnecessary to tie 
the hands of the city council 
by strictly locking in the per-

Marriage: Couple travels to SF City Hall Search: UCSD first campus 
to select new chancellor cominu£d from page I 

"It was so surreal because we 
were so tired and we had been 
awake for so long," Liebegott said. 
"It was just intense." 

San Francisco Mayor Gavin 
Newsom ordered the city clerk to 
begin issuing marriage licenses to 
same-sex couples in response to 
the equal protection clause of the 
constitution of the State of 
California. 

However, state Attorney 
General Bill Lockyer and others 
hold that Proposition 22, a 
statewide ballot initiative that was 
approved by voters in 2000, 
defines marriage as only between 
a man and a woman. 

Paul Frymer, a professor in 
UCSD's sociology department 
and expert in employment dis-
crimination, says that the issue 
will likely be decided in the 
courts. 

"[Newsom) is looking at the 
Constitution, and Prop. 22 is a 
statute," Frymer said. "That's 
where he's taking a gamble. He's 
making his own interpretation of 
California's State Constitution." 

The California Supreme Court 
denied a request for an injunction 
to StOP the same-sex marriages on 
Feb. 28. However, the court did 
agree to hear arguments on the 
matter and ordered that legal 
briefs be filed by March 5. 

Two other lawsuits challenging 
the marriage licenses have been 
filed, but trial dates have not been 
set. The ceremonies will likely 
continue until court hearings 
determine the legality of the 
licenses. 

Protesters and supporters of 
same-sex marriages gathered on 
the steps of San Francisco City 
Hall along with those hoping to be 
married. 

"The police were every-

A.S . Vice President Internal Jenn

tive. "My job was to make sure the

dents a priority." 

ordinarily talented people, you're 
talking about relatively few." 

Pae believes that the search for :l 
new chancellor comes at a critical 
time in UCSD's development. 

CouIIesy of Ali Liebeaott 
Newt)weds: UCSD lecturers Ali Liebegott (front) and Anna Joy Springer (back)

The search comes at a time when 
UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz 
are also searching for new chancel-
lors. UC Berkeley'S chancellor 
search began on Jan. 5, whjle 
UCSC's has yet to begin after cur-
rent UCSC chancellor M .R.C. 
Greenwood was appointed UC 
provost on Feb. 23. Langley believes 
being the first campus to select a new 
chancellor gives UCSD an advan-
tage in picking the best chancellor. 

"We want to make sure the new 
chancellor is going 10 represent 
UCSD to the best of his/her abili-
ties, because right now UCSD is on 
an upward trajectory and we want 
to make sure it continues going up," 
Pae said. "And that includes not 
only representing students, faculty 
and staff, but also representing 
UCSD on a state and on a national 
level." 

Langley agreed that many 
involved in the search process have 
high expectations. where," Liebegott said. "It was 

like being part of something 
political again." 

1n response to the wave of 
same-sex couples flocking to San 
Francisco to be married, President 
George W. Bush recently 
announced his support of a federal 
constitutional amendment to ban 
same-sex marriage. 

"It's not going to happen. It's 
just too hard to do," Frymer said. 
"I don't even thinle [Bush) intends 
to ever get [the support required 
to pass a constitutional amend-
ment)." 

Liebegott expressed hope that 
same-sex marriage will not be used 
by presidential candidates as a 
smoke screen for other issues like 
the war in Iraq and health care 
coverage. 

On Feb. 27., the cjty of New 
Paltz, N .Y., became the second 
city in the nation to offer marriage 
licenses to gays and lesbians. The 
mayor of the town of 6,000 people 
said it is his "moral obligation" to 
grant marriage licenses without 
regard to sexual preference. 

Frymer predicts that in 30 

years, the fight for same-sex mar-
riage will look the way the fight 
for interracial marriage does 
today. 

"Long term, we're going to 
look back at this and it's going to 
be ridiculous that we were having 
this debate," Frymer said . "This is 
the big frontier of gay and lesbian 
equality." 

"We do have an advantage [in) 
that we ' were out front," he said. 
"When you're talking about extra-

"We are at a very critical moment 
in our history, in that we have real-
ized a great deal of our potential but 
there's an understanding that we 
have not achieved all that we can 
achieve," Langley said. "A lot of that 
will be up to the new leadership." 

For Liebegott, the wedding 
ceremony was as much about 
being part of a political movement 
as about codifying her relation-
ship. 

"To be at the forefront of a civil 
rights movement seems really 
important," Liebegott said. 

Admissions: UC will defer 
admissions for two years 

Liebegott expressed that- mar-
riage seems like a more valid way 
for teachers to have a relationship 
on a university climpus. 

Regardless of how the courts 
rule about their San Francisco 
marriage license, Liebegott and 
Springer consider themselves 
spouses for life. 

"I've been with Anna Joy for a 
whi le and I really love her," 
Liebegott said. "I feel like we're 
married anyway."

"The fact that we're not able to 

take all eligible srudents this year is 
a very large disappointment," Susan 
Wilbur, UC systemwide director of 
undergraduate education, told the 
Los Angtlts Ttmts on Feb. 27. 

The university expects the 
reduction to be spread out so that 

. each of the eight undergraduate 
campuses red~es its enrollment by 
200 to 425 students. 

In the past, all students who met 
eligibility criteria were offered a spot 
at one of the campuses. 

It is as of yet unclear whether or 
not a reduction of 3,200 will be con-
sidered a break in the mission of 
California's Master Plan for Higher 
Education. The plan calls for the top 
12.5 percent of high school gradu-
ates to be offered admissions to the

8 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

--PROPS. 55, 56, 57, 5~ ___________ _

Proposi ti on 55 was placed 

on the ballot by the Leg islature 
an d is also known as the 
U niversity Public E ducation 
Facil ities Bond Act of 2004. It 
is a $12.3 -million bond issue 
that will provide funding for 
the renovation and construc-
tion of education facilities to 
re pair aging schools and relieve 
overcrowded classrooms. T he 
bond 's funds will be concentra t-
ed where t he needs are the 
greatest, and will fund upgrad-
in g and building classrooms 
fr o m kindergarten to higher 
levels of education, such as the 
.California Community 
C o lleges, the California State 
U ni versity and the University 
of C alifornia . It will provide 
matching funds to many dis-
tri c ts that, wi thout the approval 
of Propositi o n 55, would be 
unable to repair or construct 
new schools. 

Opponents of Proposition 
55 point to C aliforni a's $73 
million debt, and claim that it is 
a bo nd the state cannot afford. 

Opponents also say that the 
funds are unfairly concentrated 
in Los Angeles (the school dis-
trict tha t will receive over one-
quarter of the funds) since only 
12 percent of the state's stu -
dents are enrolled there. 
Additionally, they claim that it 
is unfair to require school dis-
tricts to match 40 percent of

students need this 

bond to increase tlle 
quality of their 
education. " 

the funds . While budgetary 
claims are compelling, 
California 's students need this 
bond to increase the quality of 
their education. 

Proposition 55 invests in the 
education 'of California's stu-
d ents, from kindergarten to 
hig her education, approximate-
ly 6.2 million pupils. It will 
modernize schools currently in 
disrepair and build facilities for 
critically overcrowded schools, 

57~es 
Propositions 57 and 58 are 

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
solutions to California's budget 
crisis. Joined at the hip, the two 
propositions must be approved 
together; neither can become law 
unJess the other is passed as well. 

And pass they must. 
Proposition 57, put on the bal-

lot by the Legislature, would issue 
a $1 5 billion bond. Unlike most 
state bonds, this one is' not meant 
to create new services, but instead 
to finance the existing budget 
defici t and maintain existing ser-
vices . 

Without Proposition 57, 
Schwarzenegger would most like-
ly propose heavy cuts to state ser-

vices, including health care and 
higher education, or drastically 
increase taxes. If passed along 
with Proposition 58, this would 
be the last time the state could 
engage in long-term borrowing. 

Opponents, including State 
Sen. Tom McClintock (R -
Thousand Oaks), argue that 
Proposition 57 would plunge 
California $15 billion deeper in 
debt; they prefer that the govern-
ment instead cut spending and 
fraud to eliminate this years bud-
get deficit. 

However, such enormous cutS 
would decimate already under-
funded programs. The state 
would run out of money by June,

and goes to where the problems 
are great; Los Angeles schools 
are in need of such funds . With 
current enrollment numbers, 
California needs to construct 
22,000 new classrooms to deal 
with overcrowding. Over the 
last ten years, both K- 12 and 
higher education have received 
local and state general obliga-
tion bonds approved by voters, 
and Proposition 55 is a neces-
sary next step on that path to 
fund schools. It provides 
matching funds that will allow 
communities to initiate larger 
projects like school construc-
tion. It will also create many 
new jobs as the construction of 
new schools gets underway. 
Even with the financial prob-
lems California faces, schools 
need to be modernized and 
built. 

Regardless of budget woes, 
schoolchildren are in class-
rooms everyday and voters can-
not afford to let the q uali ty of 
their education decrease any 
further.

and taxes would inevitably rise. 
Proposition 58 establishes a 

reserve fund, prohibits future 
deficit bonds, and mandates the 
enactment of a balanced budget. 
The reserve fund would grow to 
58 billiori and cushion against 
future unanticipated budget 
shortfalls. 

Both of these measures are 
necessary to ensure the states fis-
cal stability - now, and in the 
future. Vote yes on Propositions

Opponents of Proposition 56 

have one thing right. This measure is 
all about making it easier for the his-
torically Democratic Legislature to 
pass tax and spending bills. Given 
California's need for efficiency in 
Sacramento, however, Proposition 
56 is well-warranted. 

While the measure is billed by 
supporters as a way to hold lawmak-
ers accountable for late budgets - it 
would withhold pay from legislators 
and the governor for late budgets 
and require the Legislature to stay in 
session until the budget is passed -
Proposition 56's most important 
effect would be to lower the number 
of legislative votes needed to pass 
budget-related bills from two-thirds 
to 55 percent. Opponents say this 
will inevitably lead to higher taxes. 
But supporters hail this as a way to 
prevent small groups of legislators 
from causing gridlock on the senate 
and assembly floors. 

This argument makes perfect 
sense, considering the Legislature has 
not met the yearly budget deadline 
since 1986 and California is one of 
only three states to require a two-
thirds vote to pass a budget. More effi-
ciency and reliability means a better 
credit rating for the state, bringing us 
out of the high-interest junk bond dol-
drums. Proposition 56 also calls for 
the steady build-up of a "rainy day" 
fund , requiring 25 percent of surplus 
revenue to be set aside to maintail\ser-
vices in deficit years or for state emer-
gencies. 

The anxiety felt by the taxpayers' 
associations that oppose Prop. 56 is 
understandable, however, lowering the 
threshold to 55 percent also makes it 
easier to cwt taxes. And if Califomians 
disagree with how their representatives 
are handling tax and spending bills, 
they can always vote Republican. The 
proposition even addresses this con-
cern by requiring that a budget sum-
mary be included in ballot pamphlets, 
putting in writing exactly how each

but advocates providing resources 
for immigrants legally entering the 
United States. Marin used her post 
as U .S. treasurer to call for a finan-
cial literacy program through the 
department, helping immigrants 
and others confused by business-
speak to understand American eco-
nomics. She also toured the country 
on a lecture circuit to encourage 
Latino students to pursue higher 
education after high school. 

If she were to win the nomina-
tion, she would tour the state and 
see that the Bush policies she touts 
- No Child Left Behind, Clear 
Skies Initiative, attempted eco-
nomic stimulus - may not have 
their intended effects and could 
offer a new outlook to her cam-
paign. There's a difference 
between being soft on · an issue 
because of pressure from special 
interests and changing sides on an 
issue because of astute observa-
tions. Marin is a believable leader 
with qualities reflecting the latter. 

Marin is a former mayor of 

Huntington Parle, Calif., a 95-per-
cent Latino enclave southeast of 
Los Angeles with an 80-percent 
Democratic base. Her success in 
uniting both parties in the locale 
and her moderate views on immi-
gration are enticing enough to war-
rant her a face-off with the incum-
bent Boxer.

have the choice to do so in a 
straightforward manner. Too 
many strings are attached in 
this proposal. Vote no on

MONDAY, MARCH I , ZOO4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 9 

The Right must embrace environmentalism Mayor: Bell's 
'spaceship 

Earth' may be 
a bit much 

Returned 
yank 

Chris T~ylor 

I na recent conversation, I was told that the environment and conservation ideology is inti-
mately attached to left-wing poli -
tics. lbat is, environmentalism is 
inherently an issue that must be 
solved through big governments 
and redistribution of the wealth. 
While admittedly in recent years, 
most Republicans have had woeful 
environmental records, the idea 
that environmental issues are some-
thing the right wing shouldn't han-
dle is unfortunate and ill-conceived. 

This idea, which has become 
relatively common, is a problem for 
both sides. The Republicans have 
all but abandoned the issue to their 
opponents in government. And 
because the Left has seized it, a 
great deal of the conservative popu-
lation disregards environmental 
issues as "tree-hugging" extremism. 

This worries me, particularly 
given my divided interest between 
the two sides. Since my arrival at 
UCSD and my subsequent decision 
to join the ecology, behavior and 
evolutionary biology major, it has 
been a constant struggle to juxta-
pose my environmental tendencies 
with my conservative politics. 

For example, the Kyoto Treaty 
was a horrific piece of writing with 
fine print that was economically 
irresponsible. However, consider-
ing the desperate nature of many 
ecological systems, maybe timely 
action is better than perfect action. 
The prevention of natural fires in 
forests truly was disastrous when 

the abundance of kindle super-heat-
ed Bames which killed even incred-
ibly resistant Sequoias. However, is 
it any better to give the logging 
companies so much freedom? 

It is no news that at the present, 
environment and conservation poli-
cy lie weD in the hands of the 
Democratic Party and the left wing. 
Unfortunately, most current 
Republicans have not done much to 
further the cause of bipartisan suc-
cess. In fact, more than 55 percent 
of the Republican constituency 
believes Republican politicians are 
unable to deal with the environ-
ment at all. 1bis lack of motivation 
on behalf of conservative politicians 
gives logic to the statement that 
environmental problems may onJy 
be solved by the left wing. 

However, despite the fact that 
Republicans are currently failing 
the environment in many aspects, 
conservative politics are not inca-
pable of dealing with good conser-
vation politics. Furthermore, it is 
more important now to convince 
Republicans that the environment 
must be at the forefront of their 
attention. In fact, in the end, it may 
have to be conservative capitalists 
that save the environment. 

The reason for this lies in the 
CUlTent political trends of our coun-
try, coupled with the relative incom-
petence of the government to inter-
cede on behalf of the environment. 

First of all, the country is cur-
rently swinging to the right of cen-
ter. Regardless of the split down the 
middle ' between Democrats and 
Republicans, fir more people in the 
U.S. consider themselves conserva-
tives than Ii bera\s, according to an 
'Oct.-Nov. 2003 Gallup poIl . 
Therefore, environmentalists who 
wish to make significant policy 
changes must deal with the public 
opinion. Resisting the public rather 
than educating them will brand

environmentalists as tree-huggers, 
anarchists and conununists. 

Secondly, the reason that capi-
talism will kill the environment is 
the very reason why it must be cap-
italism that saves the environment. 
Capitalism, unrestricted, is no bet-
ter than socialism unchallenged. Its 
incredibly potent expansionary 
capabilities make the environment a 
sitting target for development, pol-
lution and other byproducts of a 
consumer world. Many analysts and 
theoreticians expect that capitalism 
will eventually devour itself once 
the world is conquered. It must be 
an act of self-preservation by capi-
talists to protect the environment. 
And many times, self-preservation 
is the fastest path to results. 

The major mechanism behind 
the halting of bad environmental 
polic}' is restriction on unchecked 
po!lution of aD kinds, including 
greel~'louse gases, habitat destruc-
tion and a myriad of other woes. 
There must be restrictions. 

Major corporations, which are 
responsible for most of the con-
cerns, need to realize that saving the 
environment does not have to entail 
redistribution of their profits. They 
should impose restrictions based on 
solid fiscal ideas such as: your com-
pany will destroy itself if it destroys 
the environment around it. 

For example, fishermen are 
causing the extinction of cod in the 
North Sea. The European Union 
has imposed 50-percent CUts in cod 
fishing, but the trawls take in fish 
anyway. There's very little policing 
of this policy. To the fishermen, 
these laws are just public opinion 
trends, imposed because the public 
has seen too many dead fish videos, 
and not out of concern for the envi-
ronment. However, what the fisher-
men must understand is that their 
jobs and livelihoods will perish 
along with the fish populations. 

With this reasoning, the fisherman 
may have an incentive to impose 
restrictions. 

The third reas'ln environmen-
talism should be bipartisan is that 
the federal government can be a 
terribly slow mechanism for saving 
the envirorunent. Standing in the 
line at the U.S. post office and real-
izing that the same bureaucracy is in 
charge of our environment gives me 
little hope for oui descendants. 

That is not to say that there 
should be no government restric-
tions. Many of the largest nature 
reserves are there because of gov-
ernment restriction. But it has 
become very harmful to the envi-

. ronment to allow environmentalism 
to be swallowed solely by the left 
wing. 

In everything, compromise is 
best. If the Left and Right can work 
together in a series of restrictions 
and corporately self-imposed stan-
dards, the chance of conservation is 
much higher. 

Unfortunately, due to extremist 
environmentalist zeal and conserva-
tive incompetence, this has not 
been the case. However, if 
Republicans can overcome their 
stigma of environmental careless-
ness, at the very least, they might 
bring more access to dialogue by 
offering their hard-line constituents 
a palatable view of an extremely 
important facet in the world. 

While there are some organiza-
tions like Republicans for 
Environmental Protections that 
continually lobby politicians to 
change their ways, there are too few 
of us environmental conservatives, 
willing to brave the disdain of both 
left-wing environmentalists . and 
angry capitalists. Hopefully that will 
change, for everyone's sake.

At the time, the companies said 
the measures were needed to cut 
rising health care costs and remain 
competitive against new nonunion 
Wal-Mart supercenters. 

Mter almost five months in the 
picket lines, the workers settled for 
a compromise that included many 
of the provisions they had initially 
opposed. 

"I think there are things [in the 
contract) that shouldn't be in there," 
said John Muir College freshman 
Josh Sugar, 311 Albertsons employee. 
"But to be honest, after four months, 
it's just not worth it anymore," 

However, UFCW International 
President Doug Dority argued the 
union had won the first battle in 
the fight for affordabl e h~alth care. 

"The employers never believed 
that workers could sustain a five-
month strike," he said in a state-
ment. "The employers completely 
underestimated the determination 
and fortitude of their employees." 

For customers, like Muir fresh-
man Jesse Chen, the end of the ' 
strike means that they can now 
return to the supermarkets without 
crossing the picket lines. . 

"I'm happy for both sides, now 
that they've reached an agree-
ment," Chen said . 

Dority that UFCW 
h~sKfined 

MVnr.,hlp C~1tr~ICts In future 
negotiations throughout the coun-
try. 

"Thr:ough their struggle, the 
striking and locked-out wgrkers 
have performed a setvice for the 
whole country. They have sOlmded 
the alarm for all of America - our 
health care benefits at work are at 
risk," he stated. "The UFCW will 
lead the fight for health care reform. 
And, [ believe, with members like 
our Southern California members, 
the UFCW will win that fight." 

The union has said that workers 
may (eturn to work within a week of 
the Feb. 29 agreement.

California and the California State 
University are currently. drawing stu-
dents for admission from outside of 
their Master Plan targets," the LAO 
report states. 

UC Student Regent Matt 
Murray, however, said that the 
reduction does constitute a breach 
of the plan in its stated intent. 

"The questions right now are 
about whether the eligibility criteria 
capture that 12 .5 percent, but the 
critical point is that we've been 
telling these current high school 
students that if they're meeting eli-
gibity requirements, they'll get in ," 
Murray said. "In my opinion, we're 
breaking the Master Plan by break-
ing our promise to those students." 

The University of California's eli-
gibility requirements include specific 
high school coursework and COI11-
bined minimum grade point average 
and examination scores. 

"It's 100 percent politics, and it's 
about the priorities of the people in 
Sacramento," Murray said. "This is 
the first example of many very unfair 
things that will happen if things keep 
going the way they are right now."

Cold or strep throat? 
Learn the differences 
to make a diagnosis 
To your 
health 

Neha Singh 
How do I know if I have a com-
mon cold or strep throat? What 
can I do to treat them? 

- Nicole Pivacek, Eleanor 
Roosevelt CoUegc sophomore 

The transition from winter to 
spring usually brings nicer weather 
but unfortunately some iUness too. 
The common cold, also known as an 
upper respiratory infection or viral 
rhinitis, can occur at any time of the 
year, but it generally has seasonal 
peaks in the fall and spring. Strep 
throat, on the other hand, occurs 
year-round 

The common cold is a viral 
infection and inflammation of the 
upper respiratory tract (nasal pas-
sages and throat), while strep throat 
is a bacterial throat infection. Both 
of these conditions are contagious. 
Strep throat is caused by the bacte-
ria strtptococcus pyogrnts. It is pri-
marily spread by coughing and 
sneezing, or by touching a contam-
inated surface and then touching 
the eyes, nose or mouth. On the 
contrary, theFe are over 200 differ-
ent viruses known to be responsible 
for the common cold. No wonder it . 
is so easy to catch. 

There is a clear difference 
between strep throat and the com-
mon cold. Symptoms of the cold 
include a stuffy nose, thin mucus 
di scharge from the nose (runny 
nose), sneezing, an itchy or stuffed 
sensation in the ears, watery eyes, a 
slight cough, headacl1es, aches and 
pains, and in some cases, a low-
grade fever andlor a sore or scratchy 
throat. On the other hand, strep 
throat has more serious symptoms. 
They include a red, sore throat with 
white patches; painful, difficult swal-
lowing; bad breath; swollen, sore 
glands in the neck; or fever, nausea 
(and possibly vomiting), decreased 
appetite, rashes, muscle aches and 
pains, and fatigue . 

"You can usually easily tell the 
difference between a strep throat 
and a cold," said Leslie Stillwater, a 
registered nurse who has been work-
ing for UCSD Healthcare for 16 
years. "If you have strep throat, you 
will nonnally see some white pus-
rules at the back of throat. Also, you 
usually do not get a sore throat with 
a cold. You can look at a sore throat, 
including strep throat, and a cold as 
two different conditions. A cold nor-
mally comes with common symp-

• 

toms like a numy nose and watery 
eyes." 

Though a doctor can normally 
tell whether you have strep throat, 
he or she will probably also run a 
throat culture to confirm the diag-
nosis. 

Almost all sore throats - includ-
ing strep - will get better on their 
own in seven . to 10 days. Strep 
throat improves more rapidly with 
antibiotics than without, but antibi· 
otics do not affect the healing of 
sore throats caused by viral infec-
tions like a cold. Antibiotics can be 
given as a pill or a shot and include 
penicillin , erythromycin or 
cephalosporin. Symptoms begin to 
disappear after only a few doses of 
medication, but it is crucial that you 
talc.e the antibiotics until you have 
finished the entire prescription. 
Untreated cases of strep throat can 
result in scarlet fever, lcidney dam-
age or rheumatic fever. 

There are no treatments to cure 
the common cold. However, a 
number of treatments can help 

. relieve the symptoms, including 
pain relievers, decongestants, saline 
nose drops, vitamin C , cough drops 

. and gargling salt water. Although 
many people think that talcing high 
doses of vitamin C can reduce the 
chance of catching a cold, research 
has not con finned this. Do not share 
drinlcing glasses or food. You should 
drink plenty of fluids, but be sure to 
avoid milk or milk products. 
Refrain from smolcing, and if you 
are hoarse, talk as little as possible. 
If you are not better within a week, 
get a professional opinion. 

It is fairly easy to prevent both 
conditions. The most important way 
to prevent contracting or spreading 
both a cold or strep throat is by 
washing your hands frequently. 
Keep hands away from your nose, 
mouth and eyes. Minimize exposure 
to infected individuals.Talcing these 
precautions greatly reduces your 
chances of catching either health ail-
ments. 
. If you would like to buy medica-

tion or see a doctor, excellent help is 
available at Student Health Services 
located on Library WalIc. It is open 
Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 
4:30 p.m., except Wednesdays when 
they are open from 9 a.m. to 4:30 
p.m. If your condition is not urgent, 
make an appointment by call ing 
them at (858) 534-3300. To get more

Dance: Dancesport team wins nat ionals 
continued from page I I 

Edwards attributes the devel-
opment of ballroom dance stu-
dents to that partnership aspect, 
since it requires effective social 
skills. 

"I've seen a lot of freshman 
start here not knowing anything 
about themselves," he said. 
"Then, through physical move-
ment they come into their slcins. 
They learn that you have to com-
municate to have a good partner-
ship and that if you move wrongly 
you can hurt other people." 

Within competitions, there 
are a variety of styles and levels. 
The formation team is a group of 
eight couples doing a choreo-
graphed routine in unison. 
Edwards choreographs the rou-
tines and mixes the music, usually 
based on a theme such as "Top 
Gun" or "Evita." The routine 

incorporates several dances such 
as samba, jive, rumba, paso doble 
and cha-cha. 

In January, UC SD's fonnation 
team won first place at the 
Intercontinental Collegiate 
Championship in Dayton Beach, 
Fla., with an "Evita"-themed rou-
tine. They were able to beat long-
time rival BYU-Idaho, a universi-
ty that has a major in ballroom 
dance. 

"We didn't just beat them by a 
littlel we beat them by a lot," 
Edwards said. 

The individual couple events 
are the other side of competition 
that allow for more spontaneity 
and creativity. The events fall into 
four categories: international stan-
dard, American smooth, interna-
tional Latin and American 
rhythm. International standard 
and American smooth both fea-

ture dances such as the wa I tz and 
tango, while international Latin 
and American rythm include 
dances like the cha-c ha and 
rumba. Partners can partici pate in 
as many events as they choose, 
though typically they focus on just 
a few. 

According to Edwards, inter-
national La tin and American 
rhythm are the most popular 
among college students since they 
allow for more personality to 
come through. International stan-
dard is the mCY~t traditional style, 
but since it is very discipl ined, few 
students participate in it. 

"It is like the ballet of ball-
room," Edwards said. "It is a lot of 
technique that students just aren't 
into. That's why I don 't teach it 
unless it is specifically requested

MONDAY. MARCH I. 2004 

Ballroom: Many on, campus 
social dance classes offered 

cOnlirwed from page I J 
for a private lesson." 

Unlike the group practice 
schedule of the formation team, 
individual couples must work with 
a coach or other dance professional 
to develop choreography on their 
own. Since the dancers do not 
know the specific music that will be 
used during the competition, they 
must develop moves that fit the 
correct rhythm and tempo, but can 
be adjusted to fit the selection dur-
ing the event. 

"It allows for spontaneity and 
creation rather than reproduction," 

" 

and after the amateur competi-
tions there will be a show put on 
by professional dancers. For stu-
dents, it is $5 to attend all of the 
events. 

11> get involved in ballroom 
dance, Edwards recommends start-
ing off with club events or classes to 
get experience in various styles 
without spending lots of money. 

"Never narrow yourself frorn 
the beginning," he said. "Have fun 
with different styles and find what 
best suits you. Then you can focus 
in and take private lessons and find 
the group you like." 

UCSD's 
Ballroom Dance 
Club holds free 

Edwards said. "I 
always tell them it 
is about being in 
the moment, 
being in space 
now. It is perfor-
mance art, so once 
you do it, it is 
gone. So you have 
to create it new 
every time to get 
that same adrena-
line and excite-
ment." 

Never narrow 
yourself from the 

beginning. Have fun 
with different styles 
and fmd what best 

events each quarter 
that allow students 
to try out dancing. 
They even offer 
lessons before the 
dance event starts if 
you are brand new. 
For infonnation on 
events in spring 
quarter, e-mail ucs4-

, II 
sUits you. 

Don't let the 
rhinestones and 
bright smiles fool 
you - this is hard 
work. Members of the ballroom 
dance community, who use the 
term "dancespon" to highlight the 
sport aspect, are currently seeking 
the acceptance of ballroom dance 
as an Olympic event. 

"It is art, but it is also a sport," 
Edwards sa id . "My kids come out 
of practice sweaty and tired just as 
much as the guys playing basketball 
over there." 

One of the keys to good dancing 
is making it look effortless, so many 
do not realize the hours of intense 
practice that go into the competi-
tions. Female dancers cha-cha in 
three-inch heels witilOut breaking 
their dazzling countenances, but 
the footwear is not without its 
drawbacks. 

"You get used to it," Cabot said. 
"Even when we're dancing in regu-
lar shoes, we are up on our toes 
because we're used to it. But we've 
all got blisters and CutS, blood in 
our shoes. It is just part of the 
sport. like ballet." 

The competition season for the 
team starts locally, with the ninth 
annual Dance by the Shores cham-
pionships on March 6. Over 20 
universities regularly attend, 
including Stanford and University 
of Southern California. The all-
day event is held at the Main Gym, 

Another option 
is the recreation 
department classes, 
which are offered to 

students for a low fee. Under the 
social dance category thcre are 
classes in ballroom, Latin and 
swing that range from beginning to 
advanced levels. To register for 
classes, visit 
http://recrelltion.ucsd.edu. 

!'Like anything else, it isn 't what 
you're doing, it is who's there," 
Edwards said. "The reason the 
team is attractive is because they 
put off a good vi be since everyone 
is trying to be positive and upbeat. 
I have a degree in microbiology. I 
do this because I get a kick out of 
people in dance. The liveliness of 
the sport attracts people with a lot 
of life."

Triton fencing takes on Cal State Fullerton, Cal Tech 
Both UCSD men's and women's teams beat C al Tech, lose to Cal State Fullerton 

By EVAN WANG 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD fencing squad fin-
ished off its regular season at its 
final tournament of the year at 
Irvine, Calif., on Feb. 22 against 
Western Region Division rivals Cal 
State Fullerton and Cal Tech, and 
now looks forward to postseason 
competition at the Western 
Regional Intercollegiate Fencing 
Championships on March 13 . 

The Trimn men lost to Cal 
State Fullerton, 15-12, and beat 
Cal Tech, 23-4. The women lost to 
Cal State Fullerton, 20-7, and beat 
Cal Tech, 18-9. 

and senior Kent Thompson. The 
threesome finished as the first, sec-
ond and third individual fencers in 
their conference in their event, 
respecrively. The sabre team was 
tops in the conference by a huge 
margin of 29 bouts. The men's foil 
team finished second and the epee 
team fourth. Overall, the men fin-
ished first overall in their confer-
ence. On the women's side, all 
three tea ms finished second, and 
overall the women finished second 
in the conference. 

The Western Division 
Championships will be held on 
March 13 at the Air Force Academy 
in Colorado Springs, Colo. Fencers 
from each of the five schools 
(UCSD, Cal State Fullerton, Cal 
Tech, Stanford and Air Force) will 
fence for the right to compete at 
the NCAA Championships. The 
top two fencers out of 15 (three 
fencers from each of the five 
schools) in each event will repre-
sent the region at the NCAA 
Championships. 

"We consider Cal State 
Fullerton to be our primary rival ," 
head coach Stuart Lee sa id. 

"Wh~never we compete against 
them, the competition is tense." 

Other individuals who placed 
high in the conference include 
junior Raelyn Jacobson and junior 
Jennifer Ngolab (second and sixth; 
women's sabre), freshman Lauren 
Walker and sophomore Mahsa 
Merat (third and fifth ; women's 
foil), freshman Jesse Taylor 
(fourth; men's foil) , freshman Kevin 
Watt and senior Timothy Tibbs 
(sixth and seventh; men's epee), 
senior Lauren Muir, junior Elise 
Goodman-Tuchmayer and sopho-
more Julia Sosis (third, fourth and 
seventh; women's epee). 

Unfortunately, the injury bug is 
plaguing the team at the worst pos-
sible time. According to Lee, 
Runyon, despite being naturally 
right-handed, has already been 
competing most of the season left-
handed because of a right shoulder 
injury suffered early in the season. 
Despite the injury, he was able to 
finish first in the conference, a 
commendable feat. Unfortunately, 
he jammed his thumb in a bout at 
Irvine and now may not be able to 
compete at the Regional 
Championships. Also lost to injury 
is Watt, who severely sprained an 
ankle at Irvine.

Women's crew leaves 
Division I VCI in wake 

Tritons varsity four stands out in 
early-season at Newport Harbor 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Staff Writer 

The UCS D women's crew team 
met Division I foe UC Irvine at 
Newport Harbor, Calif., with results 
that were decisively favorable to 
UCSD in their early stages of com-
petition. 

"IThe meet] went really well," 
senior varsity racer Jen Watters said. 
"Each boat had a really strong race. 
Our coach was very pleased with all 
of our races." 

The UCSD women's varsity four 
boat outran UCI by almost a full 
minute. UCSD came in at 8 min-
utes, 40.02 seconds, leaving UCI in 
the dust. UCI took its' time to arrive 
at the finish and finally managed to 
cross the finish in a time of 9:35.80. 

"The varsi ty four crushed Irvine 
... Ithe team] won with several boat-
lengths of open water," Watters said. 

The varsity four team was 
undoubtedly the standout of the 
meet, composed of junior Anne 
Rodd y and sophomores Phoebe Lee, 
Lauren Rui z, Meghan Kelly and 
Dannon Hodge. 

The first women's varsity eight 
race saw UCI beat UCSD with UCI 
corning in at 6:59.0, followed by the 
UCSD boat, which came in at 

7:21.3. 
Despite this minor setback, it is 

worth noting that UCI. had morc 
speed training appropriate for races 
than UCSD had prior to the meet. 

"Irvine starts their speedwork 
training before we do, so it's always 
nice to beat them this early in the 
season," Watters said. 

The second women's varsity eight 
competition saw UCSD defeat UCI 
by almost four seconds. UCSD 
crossed the line at 7:33 .8, while UCI 
lagged behind, timing in at 7:37.5. 

Relatively pleasant racing condi-
tions prevailed, with all races run-
ning against an increasing outgoing 
tide with flat water and no wind. 

To prepare for this meet and the 
other major races that will follow, 
the Tritons recently started their 
speedwork training for the racing 
season. 

After this important victory over 
UC Irvine, the team has strong 
expectations for their next meet. 

"We should do well against Long 
Beach, especially since both of our 
varsity boats are very strong and 
competitive," Watters said. 

UCSD women 's crew will be 
back in action in the March 7 
California Lightweights competition 
at Mission Bay. 

"We've been unlucky this year 
as far as injuries," Lee said. 

~Statistically, fencing is safer than 
ping pong." 

Despite the adversity, Lee has 
high hopes for a number of UCSD 
fencers to advance to the next level, 
starting with the dominant mens 
sabre team. 

"All three of those guys have a 

good chance to make it to 
Nationals," Lee said. 

Other fencers to keep an eye on 
include Taylor, who lost only three 
bouts all season (good for a fourth-
place overall finish in a highly com-
petitive field), Walker (who had a 
very strong showing at Irvine, los-
ing only one bout) and Muir (who 
represented the region last year at 
Nationals). 

"I want to enjoy myself this 
year," Muir said. "Because 1 made 
Nationals last year, theres slightly 
less pressure because I don't have to 
worry about never making 
Nationals, but at the same time, 
there's the pressure of trying to 
repeat, and do better, because you 

always want to progress . The com-
petition should be tough this year, 
but I want to finish strong." 

For the first time at the 
Regional tournament, UCSD 
fencers will consider each other 
opponents as well, as they drop the 
team label and compete individual -
ly for the right to move on. Each 
fencer competes first against team-
mates before moving onto each of 
the other schools. 

"We know each other the best, 
because we practice against each 
other all the time," Martin said. "I 
think it will really help that we 
fence each other first, because it 
really gets us feeling competitive 
and pumped up." 

Volleyball: UCSD swept in three games 
cantin ued from page :1 0 

Hoburg Patak and Nate Wack 
had 13 and 12 kills, respectively, 
and kept the Gauchos going. 
Wack had a most impressive 
night with his 12 kills coming 
on just 14 swings. 

For the Tritons, freshman set-
ter Brooks Dierdorff got the 
majority of the playing time and 
responded with 3 I assists. Junior 
outside hitter Adam Toren had 15 
kills to lead all players and senior 
oppo ite Jim Waller added 12 . 
Waller also added three service 
aces. 

Heading back into action 
quickly, UCSD headed to Cal 
State Northridge to take on the 
Matadors. After Cal State 
Northridge jumped out to an 8-3 
lead early in game one, it 
appeared the Tritons were in for 
more of the same thing that they 
faced in Santa Barbara. However, 
UCSD stormed back and knotted 
the game at 22-22 before the 
tea ms traded points to push the 
score to 26-26. The inability to 
close out games, which has been 
an issue for the Tritons, was once 
again present, and the .Matadors 
went on a 4-2 run to grab game 
one,30-28. 

In game two, the score was 
tied as late as 17- 17 before Cal 
State Northridge went on a 9-5 
run to open up the margin it 
would need to take the 30-25 vic-
tory. 

Game three saw more of the 
same as this time UCSD man-

aged to keep things tied until 16-
16 but surrendered a 5-0 run that 
proved to give the Matadors all 
they needed to close the match, 
30-23. 

"I still believe we're the best 
team in the country up to 20 
points," senior middle blocker 
Kevin Keyser said. "After that, 
we' re the worst. " 

The Tritons hit just .169 for 
the match and were lead by 
Dierdorff's 33 assists and Waller's 
10 kills . UCSD did manage to 
win the battle at the net with an 
11-8.5 advantage in the blocking 
department, led by Keyser who 
had six block assists. 

The Tritons have now com-
pleted the first half of the MPSF 
season, and with two wins have 
already equaled UCSD's best 
conference-win total for a sea-
son, but appear to be on the out-
side of the playoff picture. The 
top eight of the 12 teams in the 
conference advance to the play-
offs . 

Originally, the Tritons fig-
ured they would need nine wins 
to grab the eighth spot in the 
conference, but given first-half 
results it appears that threshold 
could drop as low as seven vic-
tories. Despite those calcula-
tions, UCSD insists it will 
remain focused on the short-
term goals. 

"I think things are going to 
come together because no team 
has ever gotten three [conference 
wins)." Keyser said. "We've got 

Lori Ilfahota/Cuorcfan fik 
At the net: Outside hitter Jeff Urton 
(above) combined for 15 kills aver the 
~. 
to worry about that third one 
first." 

The Tritons will get their next 
shot at a third win at home versus 
the University of Southern 
California on March 4 to open a 
four-match home stand that 
includes Pepperdine on March 6. 
First serve for both of those 
matches is 7 p .m . at RIMAC 
Arena. UCSD will conclude the 
home stand with matches against 
UCLA and UC Irvine on March 
10 and March 12, respectively. 

Basketball: Tritons bid farewell to lone senior Cameron Jackson on Feb. 28 
conrintled from page 20 

points . Jackson went 4-for-4 from 
the floor, including 2-for-2 from 
three -point range, and finished 
with II points and five assists. 
Sophomore guard Matthew 
Sweany and freshman forward 
Robby Peters finished with 15 and 
12 points, respectively. 

The Tritons returned to action 
the next night, Feb. 28, in the 
fi nal home game of the season, 
and they did not disappoint the 

crowd, winning a thrilling game in 
overtime against Cal State Los 
Angeles, 83-79, after being down 
by as many as \3 points late in the 
game. 

Down by 13 points with under 
nine minutes left, UCSD did not 
quit. The Tritons calmly battled 
back and sent the game to over-
time, a sign that this team has 
matured over the course of the sea-
son. 

In overtime "Mr. Clutch" 

Francis scored nine ofUCSD's \3 
points and finished with a game-
high 27 points. Sweany also had a 
great game and finished with 23 
points and eight rebounds . 
Freshmen forward Adam 
Reinking pitched in 16 points to 
contribute his part in the Triton 
victory. 

"We were juiced to tie the 
game up and send it to overtime," 
Francis said. "That momentum 
carried over into the extra peri -

od ." 
By winning for the fourth time 

in t he last five games, the Tritons 
improved to 9-16 overall and 9-11 
in the CCAA. With Sonoma 
State's home loss to Cal State 
Bakersfield on Feb. 28, UCSD 
moves into sixth place in the con-
ference standings. 

"This winning streak means a 
lot to us, but it is just unfortunate 
that it is happening so late in the 
season because we have really 

come together as a team," Francis 
said. 

The Tritons conclude their sea-
son on the road this week at Cal 
State San Bernardino and Cal Poly 
Pomona. The Coyotes are on a 23-
game win streak, having already 
clinched their fifth ~traight CCAA 
title outright on Friday. Cal Poly 
Pomona, a winner of nine straight 
games, is in a two-way tie for sec-
ond place with Cal State 
Bakersfield.

Softball sweeps Slugs, split with Toros 
Mettee hits first homer of the year, records 5 RBI against CSUSB 

By ALAN MCBROOM 
Staff Writer 

After losing in extra innings to 
open a four-game weekend road 
trip, the UCSD softball squad 
bounced back and won three in a 
row. They split the [\vo-game series 
with Cal State Dominguez Hills on 
Feb. 28 (2-3, 6-0) and swept Cal 
State San Bernardino on Feb. 29 
(12-7, 10-9). 

[n the opener, the Tritons found 
themselves locked in a pitcher'S duel 
spearheaded by undefeated fresh-
man Tina Rowe. Rowe seemed to 
get all of the support she would 
need in the top of the sixth inning 
as sophomore Jenny Spencer and 
sophomore Desiree Franciscus each 
had RBI singles to score the games 
first two rW1S. The score remained 
2-0 into the bottom of the seventh, 
with UCSD coming one out from 
victory. But two hits and an error 
proved to be the Tritons' undoing, 
as Cal State Dominguez Hills tied 
the score at two and forced the 
game into extra innings. 

Franciscus was then given the 
thankless task of relief in a game 
the Tritons thought they had won. 
She walked three in the first extra 
frame, including walking in the 
winning run with the bases loaded , 
and Cal State Dominguez Hills fin- . 
ished their emotiona l comeback. 

UCSD exacted revenge in th l! 
nightcap, exploding for six runs to 
back the four-hit shutout perfor-
mance of ~e nior pitcher Jodie 
Bland. Freshman Melanie Meurer 
broke through fim for the Tritons ' 
with a towering home run to center 
in the top of the fifth . The game 
remained tight until the seventh, 
when UCSD scored five runs on 
three hits, with sophomore out-
fie lder Niki Anderson and junior

tWd ~ Senior shortstop Kim Aggabao (left) recorded three hits in game one 
and tv.o hits in game tv.o against host cal State San Bernardino on Feb. 28. 
outfielder Breanne Cope each col-
lecting a pair of RBI in the inning. 
Franciscus led the way with four 
total hits in the two game series, 
with Cope contributing three in 
the final game. 

The next days' contests saw the 
Tritons put up 22 total runs in two 
games and still barely outdistance 
Cal State San Bernardino, which 
scored 16 runs. 

The first game saw senior third 
baseman Amy Metree hit a three-
run homer in a four-run t.hird 
inning. The round-tripper was the 
highlight of Mettee's five-RBI day, 
and was her first of the year. Senior 
Kim Aggabao and junior Jamie 
Hurst had three hits apiece. 
UCSD's only hit for extra bases was 
courtesy of the Menee blast, but 
the lack of power was made up for 
in stolen bases and sketchy defense 
by Cal State San Bernardino. Bland 
was on the mound fo r the long 
haul, working through seven tough 
innings for her fi fth win of the year. 

The back half of the doublehead-
er was a see-saw battle with plenty of 
big innings and runs. Meurer and 
Metree 'each collected their second 
homers in as many days and 
Anderson, Aggabao, Cope and 
Franciscus rapped two hits apiece to 
lead the offense. UCSD jumped on 
the scoreboard in the top half of the 
6m inning with two runs, but Cal 
State San Bernardino countered 
with twO of their own in the bottom 
of the second. Then both teams 
broke out the big sticles, with Cal 
State San Bernardino scoring five in 
the bottom of the fourth only to give 
up four in the top of the sixth. 
UCSD was up two entering the bot-
tom of the seventh and barely 
escaped after the Coyotes rallied to 
cut the lead to the final 10-9 score. 

By the end of the weekend, the 
Tritons had bumped their record to 
13 -7 overall, and 9-5 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Conference 
play, good enough for third place in 
the conference. 

UCSD aims to build through season 
Men's crew varsity eight takes out UCI in first dual meet 

By MAmtEW GRANT 
Associate Sports Editor 

The Triton men's crew team is off 
to a pleasing start this season, judg-
ing by the times it posted Feb. 28 in 
a dual meet against UC Irvine. The 
men's varsity eight finished in 6 min-
utes, 8.88 seconds, almost 10 seconds 
in front of the Anteaters' 6:17.69 on 
the glassy morning waters of 
Newport Harbor. 

"6:08 is a better time than we had 
all last year," sophomore captain Eric 
Kuhle said. "We were all focused on 
our individual technique instead of 
the other team's boat." 

At the beginning of the season, 
the team put together a series of 
goals to win the City Championship, 
the San Diego Crew Classic, and to 
medal at the Western Intercollegiate 
Rowing Association confere nce 
championship. The UCI dual meet 
served as a gauge for the Tritons to 

see how they matched up against the 
clock more than against their oppo-
nent. In that respect, th.e team is not 
concerned with its performance in 
these meets relative to the larger 
regattas. 

"We wa nt to win the C rew 
Classic and [the WIRA champi-
onshipl," Kuhle said. "We don't 
focus on winning the dual meets 
because we'd rather win the cham-
pionship races." 

The Tritons' second varsity and 
novice boats came to the race with 
the same mentality as the varsity 
eight, focusing on their individual 
goals rather than the victory. In the 
second varsity race, UCSD was 
edged out by less than four seconds 
to UCI by times of 6:35 .01 to 
6:31.82. 

In the novice race, the Anteaters 
raced two boats to one of the 
Tritons. UCSD took second place 
with a time of 6:47.6, as UCl's sec-

and varsity boat raced in at 6:38.4. 
The outcome was anything but dis-
appointing to the Triton boats, as 
they are on track to be in peak phys-
ical condition in time for the cham-
pionship races through April and 
into May. 

"UCI has been training harder 
sooner," senior Clint Wayland said. 
"I think that they are going to peak 
out too early in the season. I think 
that we will end up peaking later." 

On the whole, the team has 
expressed satisfaction with its firSt 
competition. Of the varsity eight, 
only two rowers are returning from 
last year's boat. The rest are either 
freshmen or rowers moving up from 
the novice boat. Additionally, this 
was the first collegiate race for more 
than half of the team. 

The Tritons wi ll return to the 
waters of Mission Bay on March 7 
at 7 a.m. before going to work on 
Long Beach State on March 14. 

Track: UCSD women's medley sets record 
continued from page 20 

fourth-best all-time UCSD perfor-
mance, while the 4x400 men's relay 
finis hed with a time of 3:21.19, 
which slipped the team into place 
as the ninth-fastest in UCSD track 
history. . 

On the women's side, sopho-
more hurdler Kaylin Siever gar-
nered several awards with her 
powerful efforts. Siever finished 
in first place in the women's triple 
jump with a distance of 39-3 that 
was an NCAA provisional qualify-
ing performance, a UCSD school 
record and a meet and stadium 
record . 

"The women's team did particu-
larly well, with a number of great 

performances," Salerno said. 
Senior Michelle Beebe threw an 

excellent 146-1 i in the women's 
javelin to place her in first with an 
NCAA provisional qualifying per-
formance and a UCSD school 
record. 

Women's freshman long jumper 
Elisa Holiday reached a distance of 
18-4, taking first place in the event 
and fourth-best all-time at UCSD. 

Skilled shot put and hammer 
throw specialist Sagrario 
Hernandez took second place in 
the women's shot with a throw of 
45-8 and placed fifth with an 
NCAA provisional qualifying per-
formance in the women's hammer, 
throwing 158-8 for another NCAA 

provisional qualifying perfor-
mance. 

The UCSD women's distance 
medley relay took second place 
with a time of 12:06, which is also a 
UCSD school record. 

A slew of top-rate Division I 
opponents, including the 
University of Southern California, 
raced at the Rossi Relays, but the 
Division II Tritons seemed to stand 
out over the opposition. 

The next meet will be the 
March 6 All-Cal Championship, in 
which the Tri tons will take on sev-
era l Division I schools, including 
UC Irvine, UCLA, UC Riverside 
and UCSB . UC Irvine will host the 
event.

woes 
continue 

By STEPHEN VONDERACH 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's basketball 
team finished its home schedule 
strongly with a pai r of wins over Cal 
State Dominguez H ills on Feb. 27, 
75-72, and Cal State Los Angeles 
on Feb. 28, 71-63. The Tritons 
improved to 14- 11 overall and 10-
JO in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. 

Senior guard Ali Ginn entered 
the Feb. 27 game 26 points shy of 
all -time UCSD leading scorer 
Lisa Iileaver's 1,274 point record, 
set between 1989 and 1994. Ginn 
had four points in the first half. 

"First half we pretty much 
traded baskets," said Ginn. "It was 
pretty clo e." 

UC 0 was only up three points 
to start the second half, 36-33, but 
the Tritons slowly expanded on the 
lead with the help of an II -point 
run to put them up 54-39. 

T he Toros came back strong, 
however, and managed to cut the 
UCSD lead back to one point with 
five minutes remaining. 

"They came back," Girm said. 
"They started hi tting shots, and 
we went cold." 

UCSD never gave up the lead. 
T he Tritons scored the next five 
points and hit free throws in the 
fi nal minutes to secure the win. 

"We showed a lot of poise," 
Ginn said of the team's response to 
the Cal State Dominguez Hills run. 
"We made some clutch baskets and 
made our free throws at the end." 

Ginn finished with an impres-
sive 15 points, 12 rebounds and 
nine assists, one assist shy of a 
triple-double. Junior forward 
Margaret Johnson poured in 20 
points and grabbed 14 rebounds. 

G uards freshman Leora Juster and 
sophomore Andrea H erold both 
cored in double figures. UCSD 

also had a commanding lead in 
rebounds, 54-32. 

Octavia Askew led Cal State 
Dominguez Hills with 21 points. 
Two others scored in double dig-
its. 

Cal State Dominguez Hills 
dropped to 11-13 overall and 7 -12 
in the CCAA with the loss. 

T he results of the Feb. 28 game 
turned out much like the first. The 
first half of the last home game of 
the season, Senior Night, was very 
close. T he teams traded baskets 
and neither team was able to pull 
ahead. T he lead shifted back and 
forth in the final minutes of the 
half, but a lay-up at the buzzer put 
Cal State Los Angeles up by one 
point. 

UCSD went on a big run to 
open the second half, just as in the 
previous game, earning a 10-point 
lead. Cal State Los Angeles stormed 
right back with a 10-2 run to cut the 
Tritons' lead to two points. 

UCSD scored the next four 
points, and again it was clutch shots 
down the stretch, especially free 
throws, that sealed the victory. 

T he Golden Eagles fell to 6- 19 
overall and 5- 15 in the CCM. 

Ginn hit two free throws with 
two minutes left in the game to 
break the all-time scoring record . . 
She finished with 15 points. The 
other senior, forward Robyn 
Phillips, finished with seven points 
and six rebounds. Johnson Had 23 
points and 12 rebounds for anoth-
er double-double. Freshman Kim 
Buffum finished with 12 points, 
coming on four three-pointers. 
Ginn was honored in a short cere-
mony after the game. 

Track and field breaks 
school records 

UCSD opens season at Rossi Relays 
on Feb. 28 at Claremont College 
By MICHAEL SCHOECK 

Senior Staff Writer 

T he UCSD men's and women's 
track and field teams competed in 
the Feb. 28 Rossi Relays, held at 
Claremont College, posting several 
school records and earning a num-
ber of national qualifying perfor-
mances. 

T hough it was a non-scoring 
meet, the Tritons trampled over 
their competitors with the help of 
several individual standouts, most 
of whom are veteran track stars 
that broke their own school 
records. 

In the men's 400-meter hurdles 
was sophomore Jon Patton, whose 
first-p lace, 53 .06-second perfor-
mance was an N CAA provisional 
qualifying performance, a UCSD 
school record, Rossi Relays meet 
record and a stadium record . 

"Patton improved on his own 
school record , and his time was 
more than good enough for 
nationals," head coach Tony 
Salerno said. 

In the 100-meters, Triton 
sophomore sprinter Peiman 
Lahsaei timed in at 11.02, captur-
ing the fourth aU-time best position 
for the Tritons. 

Senior Marcus Keller excelled 
in the triple jump, reaching a dis-
tance of 46 feet, 11.5 inches, good 
enough to take the third all -time 
best distance at UCSD.

No. 14 Tritons 
lose to No.7 

UCSB and No.6 
Matadors 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The No. 14 UCSD men 's \ '01-
leyball team finished the first hal f 
of the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation schedule with much 
less than a bang. Consecutive 3-0 
losses at No.7 UCSB (30-21 , 30-
28, 30-17) and No. 6 Cal State 
Northridge (30-28, 30-25, 30-2 3) 
was more like a thud, and left the 
Tritons (6-11 overall, 2-9 in con-
ference) in a tough position upon 
which to make a playoff bid. 

On Feb. 26 in Santa Barbara, 
Caif., UCSD ran into an opponent 
too hot to stop. The Gauchos 
committed just seven attack errors 
on the evening with 48 kills for a 
.526 attacking percentage, ~om­
pared to .280 for the Tritons. 
UCSB also had a 25- 15 advantage 
in digs, had seven service aces to 
UCSD's four, and out-blocked the 
Tritons 12-3. 

UCSD made its only serious 
run at the Gauchos in game two, 
but came up just short. UCSB's

Men's basketball slams the door 
Tritons on season-high, three-game winning streak 

By MATT RYAN 
SeniOl Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team posted back-to-back wins on 
Feb. 27 and Feb. 28 at RIMAC 
Arena. The wins over Cal State 
Dominguez HiIIs and Cal State 
Los Angeles give the Tritons a 
season-high, three-game winning 
streak. 

The Tritons, who were com-
ing off their biggest win of the 
season against UC Davis on Feb. 
21, ret.urned home to face the 
Cal State Dominguez Hills 
Toros and won a close game, 83-
77. 

In the first half, the Tritons 
trailed 20-14 with seven mlnutes 
and 14 seconds remaining, but 
then found their outside shoot-
ing. UCSD hit three consecutive 
three-pointers within 50 sec-
onds, two of them coming from 
junior guard Brandon Francis, to 
take a 23 -20 lead, an advantage it 
would not surrender the rest of 
the game. The Tritons took a 38-
29 advantage into the locker 
room at the half. 

"We have had to deal with the 
loss of a few key players recendy, 
and so our offense has changed," 
Francis said. "I can look to drive 
and score more and that's what I 
have been doing." 

• The Tritons continued to hit 
three-point shots in the second 
half. With the lead cut down to 
two at 54-52, senior guard 
Cameron Jackson calmly hit from 
downtown to push the lead back
