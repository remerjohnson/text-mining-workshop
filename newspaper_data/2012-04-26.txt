JOSH TILLMAN ON LEAVING 
FLEET FOXES AND STAYING TRUE

BY REN EBEL
Hiatus Editor

W hen he left Fleet Foxes early this year, drummer Josh Tillman posted a brief offi-
cial statement to his Tumblr.

“Back into the gaping maw of 
obscurity I go,” he wrote. “Tokyo is 
my last show with the Foxes. Sorry 
if I was distant and obtuse if we ever 
met. Have fun.”

It’s a somewhat ambiguous 
farewell for a guy who’s been with 
the platinum-selling indie folk suc-
cess story for over four years, but 
Tillman has always been clear that 

he was more of a hired musician to 
the group than a collaborator. He’s 
channeled his own, decidedly more 
cryptic brand of songwriting over 
the last eight years, with seven full-
length releases under his J. Tillman 
moniker. And now, as Father John 
Misty, Tillman has a new band, a 
new sound and a new answer to the 
irresistible call of obscurity.

Tillman spoke with the Guardian 
last week about his upcoming per-
formance in San Diego May 2 and 
his new album, Fear Fun, which 
drops May 1 on Sub Pop.

LGBT Hosts “Out and Proud” Week 
BY AYAN KUSARI 
Staff Writer

UCSD’s Lesbian Gay Bisexual 
Transgender Queer Intersex Alliance 
declared Week Four of Spring Quarter 
2012 Out and Proud Week, a five-day 
event geared at raising awareness of 
LGBT issues. 

The tradition began over 30 years 
ago, LGBT Resource Center Director 
Shaun Travers said.

“It started out in the eighties as 
‘Wear Jeans if You’re Gay Day’,” Travers 

said.
In its three-decade history, Out and 

Proud Week has grown from an inside 
joke to a festival that takes a year to 
plan. 

“It’s gotten so big that we start 
planning a year out,” Vanidy M. Bailey, 
Assistant Director for Education at the 
LGBT Resource Center, said. “The first 
thing we have to do is in Fall Quarter. 
That’s when we reserve Library Walk 
— it gets really booked up.” 

This year’s event was arranged with 
the help of about 20 student volun-

teers. They represent many of the 18 
individual LGBT and gender-based 
organizations on campus. 

Bailey said that available funding 
limited the scope of the week’s events. 

“If we had our way, we would make 
it a really large event, like last year, 
when we had the transgender film 
fest,” he said. “For instance, if we could 
bring in the authors you read in critical 
gender studies classes — that would

STUDENT LIFE

BY NICOLE CHAN 
Associate News Editor

A photo of A.S. Campuswide 
Senator Ashton Cohen dressed in 
Muslim garb has drawn criticism 
from students for being offensive to 
Arabs. Student Affirmative Action 
Committee co-chair Josue Castellon 
said that SAAC hopes A.S. Council 
will officially address the photo, and  
added that the organization is trying 
to institute mandatory trainings for 
councilmembers to address issues of 
identity and privilege.  

Arab Student Union and Students 
for Justice in Palestine member Noor 
El-Annan posted the photo on her 
personal Facebook profile Sunday 
night, after a friend emailed it to her. 
The photo showed Cohen dressed in a 
robe and head covering with three girls 
next to him; the caption alluded to his 
“three wives.”

“I was offended and disgusted 
that someone would think that’s OK 
to wear to a party,” El-Annan said. 
“I’m all for themes, but he didn’t even 

acknowledge that it might offend 
people — something that my grand-
parents would have worn was funny 
to him.”

SAAC co-chair Amal Dalmar said 
that Cohen’s actions are representa-
tive of a university-wide problem that 
needs to be addressed at the admin-
istrative level. Dalmar said that stu-
dents from the Arab Student Union, 
Muslim Student Union and Students 
for Justice in Palestine have requested 
more Palestinian, Muslim and Arab 
representation in the form of more 
classes and educational programs. 

“It’s telling of the notion that people 
have of Muslims in a post 9/11 cli-
mate,” Dalmar said. “Because we are 
in a ‘war of terror,’ people think it’s so 
foreign, [Muslims] are not even seen as 
individuals, and it’s OK because they’re 
not from here.”

El-Annan and Dalmar said that 
they are not calling for Cohen’s resig-
nation, but hope that SAAC’s meet-
ing with university administration 
will yield action. El-Annan said that 
she hopes the administration issues a 
formal recognition of the events and 
sends a specific email to Muslim and 
Students for Justice in Palestine stu-
dents to let them know them know 
that they are safe on campus.

“We don’t want to be reaction-
ary, we want administration to make

UCSD GRAD MISSING 
SINCE APRIL 8

UCSD graduate Guillermo 
Pino Jr. has been missing for 
two weeks, since Sunday, April 
8. Pino’s family is reaching out 
to the community for prayers, 
information and donations in 
hopes of finding him. 

Pino disappeared just 
after noon on April 8 when 
he became separated from the 
group he was hiking with in 
the Anza-Borrego Desert State 
Park. His family describes him 
as 6 feet tall and 180 pounds. 
He was last seen in a portion 
of the park called the “Hidden 
Cave.”

there.” 
Though organizing Out and Proud 

Week is complicated, its message is 
simple.  

“[The event] always been about 
visibility,” Travers said. “It’s always been 
about staying in the public conscious-
ness.”

Out and Proud Week, in its current 
form, always kicks off with “Brown 
Bag Lunch Event.” 

The Brown Bag Lunch is a reenact-
ment of the UCSD LGBT community’s 
response to hate speech during Out 
and Proud Week 2004.

In response to that year’s Out and 
Proud Week, a preacher stood directly 
in front of the LGBTQIA tent and bal-
loon arch and delivered a half-hour 
sermon condemning homosexuality. 
Travers, who witnessed the incident, 
responded by arranging an event via 
email to demonstrate solidarity for 
LGBT individuals. 

Nearly everyone he emailed 
showed up. 

“We filled the entire space in front 
of the bookstore on Library Walk,” he 
said. “All we did was eat our brown bag 
lunches. But it was a powerful moment 
of community for all of us.” 

This was the original Brown Bag 
Lunch. 

On April 24, LGBTQIA hosted a 
forum on coming out, and the issues 
accompanying the process. Wednesday 
featured a panel called “Proud and 
Out?,” an analysis of the meaning of 
pride for the gay community. 

“The point of the forum is to take 
a serious look at these issues,” Travers 
said. “Who knows what the ‘right’ 
thing to do is? At the same time, we’re 
probably not going to have an ‘In and 
Humble’ week next year.” 

On Thursday there is a fundraiser 
for HIV/AIDS victims. Participating 
off-campus San Diego restaurants will 

donate 25 percent to 100 percent of 
their profits for the day to the Dine Out 
for Life charity. Thursday night also 
marks Take Back The Night, a forum, 
performance and candlelight vigil held 
for victims of relationship violence. 

“Every other week of the year, 
it’s easy for someone on campus to 
walk around and not know we exist,” 
Travers said. “It’s easy for someone to 
overlook us. But this week is different. 
Even if you don’t stop at the tent, you 
will on some level think of the LGBT 
community.”

changes,” Dalmar said.
Cohen emailed the A.S. Council 

list-serv on Tuesday in defense of his 
actions. He said the photo was taken 
two weeks ago at a costume party and  
that the outfit he is wearing is from 
Dubai.

“The picture in question was with 
three of my friends, two of whom are 
Muslim,” Cohen said. 

Cohen said that he thought nothing 
of the photo, but received Facebook 
messages a couple of days later from 
students, including three councilmem-
bers and one student not on council. 

“Most of them went behind my 
back and went on a rant on the A.S. 
Council Facebook [private group] 
page, making a mockery of me,” Cohen 
said. “I said: If anyone has a problem, 
they can message me and we can talk 
about it.”

Cohen said that one person has 
agreed to meet with him and another 
person called him a racist. 

According to Cohen, all three 
people who messaged him about the 
photo brought up his stance against 
divestment and wanted to use his cur-
rent actions to impeach him from his 
council position. A.S. Council voted 
Feb. 29 against the divestment reso-
lution calling for the University of 
California to divest from its shares in 
GE and Northrop Grumman, corpora-
tions that  manufacture materials used 
by the Israeli Defense Forces in the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 

“I got a lot of positive feedback 
by the vast majority people on A.S.,” 
Cohen said. “There are three people 
trying to compel people to go against 
me, but it backfired.”

Despite stating in Tuesday’s email 
that he would not attend Wednesday 
night’s A.S. Council meeting, Cohen 
said he planned on going to the meet-
ing as scheduled. Cohen said that he 
plans to address the councilmembers 
who have spoken out against him.

“I just think it’s regretful that the 
racist card can be thrown out so eas-
ily,” Cohen said. “Rather than debating 
on the issue, they threw out the racist 
card. It’s regretful that that happens to 
anyone on council. I really think we 
need to reach a more sober tone.”

Cohen said that he has not removed 
the photo from his Facebook profile; 
his profile is private. 

“I was very surprised that they 
went through these sort of extremes,” 
Cohen said. “I really think the worst 
thing you can call someone is a racist. 
I have so many Muslim friends and 
I come from a Muslim background 
myself.”

El-Annan, who said that she has 
not contacted Cohen, said his actions 
are illustrative of Arab erasure on cam-
pus.

“I can assume what he thinks of 
Arabs already, I don’t want to be in 
contact with him,” El-Annan said. “I 
would not feel comfortable being in 
the same room as him.”

Dalmar compared Cohen’s photo 
to the Compton Cookout, as both 
racially charged incidents began with 
theme parties and racial costumes.

“If we as a student body don’t 
react to events like this, anybody’s 
culture can be mocked and ridi-
culed,” Dalmar said. “People who 
identify as Arab have asked for him 
to take it down, but he hasn’t because 
he doesn’t understand why it’s offen-
sive. The caption says ‘all three of his 
wives’ — which directly hits home 
with Islamophobia, by asserting 
that they’re womanizers, abusive to 
women — he’s confirming it with his 
words and dress.”

Castellon said that several stu-
dents have emailed him with con-
cerns over the photo. He has since  
emailed university administra-
tion and plans to meet with Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue and Assistant Vice Chancellor 
for Student Life Gary Ratcliff on 
Monday, April 30. 

According to Castellon, all 13 
administrative members he con-
tacted have responded and agreed 
to meet immediately with him and 
Dalmar.

A.S. President Alyssa Wing 
declined to comment, citing 
Cohen’s actions as a “non-issue.”

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, APRIL 26,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 3

As their term comes to a close, this year’s councilmembers continue to contemplate their 
impact on the school and the legacy 
they will leave for future councils.

University Centers Advisory 
Board Chair 
Nicole Metildi 
and Vice Chair 
Albert Trujillo 
presented coun-
cil with infor-
mation to help 
members decide 
whether to re-
certify the Master Space Agreement 
they have with UCSD’s co-operatives. 
Metildi and Trujillo reported that 
the co-ops — Groundworks, the 
General Store, the Food Co-Op and 
the Che Café — owe over $100,000 to 
University Centers and that the Che 
Cafe lost its non-profit status by not 
submitting tax forms for three con-
secutive years.

Associate Vice President of 
Enterprise Operations Brian McEuen 
heard plenty of catcalls after being 
declared this week’s Councilmember 
of the Week.

“You go, you sexy man!” a coun-
cilmember yelled.

Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Samuel Chang 
told council about rising tuition costs 
and called to attention the California 
Master Plan for Higher Education of 
1960, which recommended that tuition 
should not be charged to California 
residents. The proportion of the state’s 
general funds that goes to the UC 
system has gone from 8 percent to 2 
percent over the last 40 years.

He also reported on a new tax by 
the UC Office of the President which 
has already been imposed on UC 
Riverside and UC Santa Barbara The 
tax caused UCSB to freeze all funding 
for student organizations to pay off 

the $180,000 the university was fined.
“UCOP passed this in July, but 

no one knew about this until April,” 
Chang. “This means a lot about the 
communication between the Regents 
and A.S.”

A.S. President 
Alyssa Wing and 
C a m p u s w i d e 
Senator Matthew 
Bradbury gave a 
special presentation 
focused on internal 
reform and restruc-
turing the A.S. 

standing committees. The council 
spent a good deal of time deliberating 
the impact this change would have 
for future councils.

“These committees as they are now, 
exist as rubber stamps,” Wing said.

She and Bradbury proposed 
dividing the two current commit-
tees (finance and campus affairs) into 
four: legislative, finance, rules and 
campus outreach. 

“Not everyone on each committee 
is actively participating in their com-
mittees, so why not have people on 
smaller committees that they have to 
answer to and that they are good at?” 
Bradbury said.

AVP of Student Advocacy Bryce 
Farrington noted that the council’s 
unanimous vote to approve a res-
olution in opposition to the poli-
cies of the revised Student Conduct 
Code did not fall on deaf ears. He 
reported that the administration will 
address student concerns by specify-
ing police’s off-campus jurisdiction 
and dealing with the judicial boards.

The council voted unanimously 
to give the ASUCSD Lip Dub a new 
allocation of funds in order to re-
film the Lip Dub, as the first was not 
of the quality expected and did not 
accurately represent the campus and 
the organizations involved.

California used to be known 
as a place where middle and 
working class families would settle 
so that their children could have 
access to affordable top public 
universities and unparalleled job 
opportunities.  However, this dream 
has been deteriorating over the 
last 20 years, as tuition for a UC 
education has increased by around 
21 percent over the past couple 
years, more than any other state.  
In addition, graduating students 
are leaving college straddled with 
unprecedented student loans and an 
underperforming job market. But it 

doesn’t have to be this way.
Speaker John Perez’s Middle 

Class Scholarship Act is a major step 
in relieving the financial burden for 
many California families.  Under 
the two bills, which are currently in 
the California state legislature, both 
UC and Cal State tuition would be 
cut by two-thirds for families that 
make between $80,000 and $150,000 
a year.  Additionally, the scholarship 
provides over $150 million in aid to 
community colleges.

And what’s even better is that 
this bill wont be funded on the 
backs of California’s residents.  

Instead, the scholarship 
gets revenue by closing a tax 
loophole that enables out-of-state 
corporations to pick which tax rate 
they pay.  This measure, which has 
broad bipartisan support in the 
California state legislature, would 

generate over $1 billion in revenue 
and help middle class families as 
well as California businesses.

Investing in higher education is 
beneficial for not just students, but 
all California residents.  According 
to estimates, the scholarship would 
help around 42,000 UC students 
save $8,169 per year.  This would 
help lessen the massive debt for 
many California students and 
enable many to actually attend a 
UC.  Additionally, lowering costs 
to higher education isn’t just good 
for students — it’s good for the 
economy of California.  According 
to the California community 
college chancellor’s office, for every 
$1 taxpayers spend on higher 
education, the state gets a $3 return 
on its investment.

Ultimately, momentum is 
building for the scholarship 

throughout all UC campuses, 
especially at UCSD. Through 
passionate and vocal support from 
students and faculty alike, UCSD 
is leading the charge.  We have 
collected more petitions in support 
of the scholarship than any other 
UC or Cal State campus.  This is 
due to the inherent importance 
students see in making college more 
accessible and affordable amidst 
rising college fees.  

However, our work here is 
not done. We need your help to 
show our legislators why investing 
in public higher education is 
integral to sustaining the future 
of California. Increasing access to 
higher education by lowering costs 
must be a priority of the California 
legislature. We must stand together 
in our support. Sign the petition and 
take action today.

California Legislature Should Prioritize Lowering Tuition Costs
GUEST COMMENTARY

It sounds crazy, but sitting in a hot tub might actually help you fight off serious diseases, like 
hypertension and diabetes.

Type II diabetes is now considered 
an American epidemic: One out of 
10 people over the age of 20 have 
diabetes. Current trends suggest that 
one out of three children born after 
2000 will develop diabetes during his 

or her life according to the Diabetes 
Partnership of Cleveland. There is a 
pressing need, now more than ever, to 
find ways to combat type II diabetes. 

Let’s hop in our hot tub time 
machine and travel back to 1999:

Philip L. Hooper, M.D., published 
a study in the most impactful journal 
in medicine, The New England Journal 
of Medicine, about the effect of “hot 
tub therapy” on his diabetic patients. 
His medical approach: have them sit 
neck-deep in a hot tub for 30 minutes, 
six times a week. 

Incredibly, after three weeks of 
hot tubbing, the average patient 
experienced a significant decrease in 
blood glucose levels. One man had 
to reduce his insulin medication by 
almost 18 percent to prevent his blood 
sugar from dropping too low. 

Sitting in a hot tub either increased 
the effectiveness of the insulin or 
caused glucose uptake by a different 
insulin-independent mechanism, 
similar to the effects of exercise. But 
nobody actually knows the answer, 
because nobody followed through. 

Instead, two scientists published 
replies essentially saying “Nice try, 
but hot tubs can be lethal.” There are 
bacteria (pseudomonas) that grow in 
hot tubs that can kill you, and patients 
with diabetic neuropathy (nerve 
damage) can unknowingly burn 
themselves. Their bottom line: Putting 
diabetics in a hot tub is a bad idea.

Shortly after his publication, 
Hooper must have found out about 
the heat shock response and about 
heat shock proteins.To know what this 
is, we need to send our hot tub time 
machine further back to 1962.

Fifty years ago, in Pavia, Italy, it 
was a young artist by the name of 
Ferruccio Ritossa who accidentally 
discovered the heat shock response. 
While taking a course in molecular 
genetics, one of the other students 
changed the temperature of his 
drosophila (fruit fly) incubator to 
higher than it should have been. 

When Ferruccio examined the 
drosophila chromatin, he noticed 
that it was changing in a way that 
makes DNA more accessible to be 
copied, or transcribed. He figured out 
it was being caused by the increase 
in temperature. Last year, Virginia 
Vega, Ph.D, and Laura Alexander, 
M.D., from UCSD demonstrated that 
the heat shock response improves the 
condition of non-obese diabetic mice. 

This stress response can be 
activated by sitting in a hot tub, 
trauma, exposure to metals, free 
radicals, exercise and even alcohol. 
No, you shouldn’t go out and get 
drunk after reading this, just like you 
shouldn’t ingest harmful metals, but 
it’s definitely food for thought.

It looks like multi-billion dollar companies Chrysler, General Motors, International Paper, Kimberly-Clarke and Procter & 
Gamble are preventing educational access, 
stirring up opposition to state legislation that 
would create a scholarship for middle-income 
college students. Their dissent is hardly a 
shocker: The Middle Class Scholarship Act, 
introduced by co-author and Speaker of the 
California Assembly John Perez (D-Calif.) 
in February, would raise corporate taxes on 
these companies to direct the money toward a 
middle-class scholarship program that would 
slash fees by two-thirds for families earning 
between $80,000 and $150,000.

Basically, it’s the students versus the 
corporations, and we shouldn’t let the state 
prioritize big business over education without 
one hell of a fight. Though the bill has broad 
bipartisan support in the state legislature, 
widespread student support is also crucial. Sign 
the petition, as per A.S. President Alyssa Wing’s 
request below, and get involved.

Students making under $80,000 a year 
already receive extensive financial aid packages, 
but those coming from families making between 
$80,000 and $150,000 receive little help. Due to 
the burden caused by increasing student fees 

(UC fees have increased 145 percent since the 
2003-04 school year), these students need all the 
help they can get. The Middle-Class Scholarship 
Act would effectively decrease student fees to 
what they were pre-crisis — lower than they 
were in that 2003-04 year.

But the act doesn’t actually “raise” corporate 
taxes to do this — it’s simply eliminating an 
unfair loophole. The Middle Class Scholarship 
Act consists of two bills — AB 1500 and AB 
1501 — with AB 1500 eliminating a part of 
a 2009 budget deal that allows out-of-state 
corporations to choose the tax rate they owe 
California. AB 1501 would then establish 
the Middle Class Scholarship Program and 
allocate the money saved from AB 1500 to the 
program. The act would generate $1 billion in 
revenue, with approximately 42,000 UC students 
receiving a Middle Class scholarship to save 
$8,169 per year. About 150,000 CSU students 
will save $4,000 per year. Further, $150 million 
will be distributed to the California Community 
College System, to be allocated at the discretion 
of the individual colleges.

The elimination of the tax loophole will 
also help California businesses by leveling the 
playing field against these large, out-of-state 

Share the Wealth
Students should rally behind the Middle Class Scholarship Act, a piece of  legislation 

which will effectively curb corporate wealth and benefit public higher education.

corporations. Because of this loophole, 
out-of-state corporations gain about 
a billion dollars in tax advantages 
over the in-state companies they are 
competing with.

And the money from the act will 
go directly to students who qualify 
— not to the general UC fund, where 
it won’t necessarily benefit students. 
But if student fees increase, under the 
fixed $1 billion budget of AB 1501, 
students would receive the same relief 
they got before the increase. 

Basically, the Middle Class 
Scholarship would provide tuition 
relief, but it won’t prevent tuition itself 
from going up. Herein lies the act’s 
only real problem: It won’t provide the 
relief it intends if the UC sees it as an 

opportunity to increase student fees 
without, seemingly, repercussions as 
large as they would have been before.  

When it comes to the community 
college system, AB 1501 might not be 
the best possible relief either. Money 
toward community colleges shouldn’t 
go toward tuition cuts, since, at about 
$1,500 a year, the colleges are usually 
affordable for middle-class students. 
In reality, living expenses tend to 
be higher than college expenses, 
especially when students can’t even 
get into the classes they need. In the 
2009-10 academic year, for example, 
close to 140,000 entering students 
were unable to register for a single 
course. But either way, the community 
colleges will be allowed to reduce 
fees however they see fit, whether it 

be through decreased course costs 
or cheaper parking permits. Though 
offering more classes would be the 
best solution, cost reductions would 
also be an undeniable relief to many.

While there are certainly other 
statewide needs the money from 
AB 1500 could go toward, we firmly 
believe that education should be a 
priority. For every dollar we spend 
on higher education, the state gets a 
$3 return on its investment. With the 
Middle-Class Scholarship Act we can 
effectively increase the number of 
students who can attend college, while 
also offering concrete, economic relief 
to families that will really affect their 
lives for the better — all while sticking 
it to the man (read: corporations). 
How perfect.

Dear Editor,
The U.S. Supreme Court 

sold our democracy without our 
consent.  Now we must act.

All democratically-minded 
Americans agree that the 2012 
election should be decided by voters, 
not corporations.  But thanks to 
the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 
Citizens United v. Federal Election 
Commission, the people’s voices are 
being drowned out by ads paid for 
by anonymous super PACs. We need 
to fight back before we lose what’s 
left of our democracy. 

The Attorney General of 
Montana, Steve Bullock, has 
recently filed a lawsuit with the 
Montana Supreme Court to enforce 
common sense campaign finance 
laws, and he won. He wants to 
continue his fight before the U.S. 
Supreme Court. It’s time for the 50 
state attorneys general, especially 
California Attorney General Kamala 
Harris, to oppose the Supreme 
Court’s decision. Throughout our 
nation’s history, citizens have joined 
together to pass reform and prevent 
corruption.  It’s our time to stand up 
and be counted. We must prevent 
our country’s government from 
being bought and sold to the highest 
bidder.

Dear Editor, 
A colonel was en route to 

Cartagena, Colombia — to 
supervise the Pentagon portion of 
the investigation into an incident 
that has embarrassed the United 

States — when Army General 
Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, at a speedily 
improvised news conference said,  “I 
can speak for myself and my fellow 
chiefs: We’re embarrassed by what 
occurred in Colombia, though we’re 
not sure exactly what it is.”

What he should have said was, 
“We are really really, really super-
duper sorry that previous service 
members, none of whom any of 
the current joint chiefs know, were 
reckless with the maid staff at Hotel 
Caribe.”

This is similar to the apology 
that the Koala — San Diego State’s 
alternative student-run newspaper 
— tendered to Associated Students 
as part of its sanction to become 
a student organization again. The 
Koala lost its student organization 
status about five years ago after 
an incident involving Koala staff 
members urinating in the elevators 
of the old Aztec Center. (When a 
student organization is in violation 
of the Student Organization Code of 
Conduct, Student Life & Leadership 
can impose various sanctions on it.) 

An apology was demanded 
in February 2010 as a part of its 
resolution against an article about 
rape in the Koala, condemning it for 
inciting rape and “diagramming how 
to rape, when to rape, who to rape 
and how to get away with raping a 
woman.”

Ifind absolutely nothing redeem-able about “Glee.” Once upon a time — that is, circa 2009 — it 
was one of the newest, most excit-
ing shows on television. Of course, 
it has since gone down the drain, 
but I can’t lie — I was a fan in its 

early days. It was a show that could 
easily bounce between Lea Salonga-
like renditions of “Les Misérables” 
to chart-topping covers of Journey. 
Who cared if it didn’t really have a 
plot; the show was, for lack of a bet-
ter word, groundbreaking.

Now, three seasons in, “Glee” has 
reached “Heroes” season 3 levels of 
bad. It’s not that things are boring on 
“Glee” — it’s just really, really hard to 
give a fuck. “Glee”’s glitz and glam-
our have faded, making it a total 
mockery when compared to actual 
quality television like “Modern 
Family” and “Breaking Bad.” 

Still, we should give credit where 
credit is due. Creator Ryan Murphy 
clearly knows how to choose plot-
lines that are relevant to his view-
ing demographic and timely to the 
world at large. The gay bullying saga 
occurred at the height of the teen-
age suicide “epidemic” in the Fall of 
2010. 

But Murphy’s real problem is his 
penchant for worrying an interest-
ing plotline to death. He clearly sees 
the potential in ’90s after-school 
special topics like teen pregnancy, 
homosexuality, suicide and virginity, 
but instead of nurturing the contro-
versial storyline, Murphy tosses the 
issues all into one episode and ties 
it all together with a rousing (but 
no longer interesting) song and, 
of course, a moral. After watching 
every character go through a “com-
ing of age” saga at least five times an 
episode, it’s hard to care anymore. 
During a recent rage-fest about 
“Glee,” my friend asked me which 
character I actually enjoyed seeing 
on screen. We decided that it would 
obviously be much easier to list off 
the characters that we disliked, and 
at the end, we were left with none. 
Sorry Blaine, or Blaise, or whatever 
“soulful” name the writers gave you 
— when you took off your prep boy 
jacket and left your adorable boy 
acapella group, I was left fanning 
myself with disinterest. 

Sorry Rachel, you can’t put a 
price on how much I don’t care 
about your desire to be a star. Your 
voice is your only redeeming quality. 

Sorry Finn, but from the very 
first episode when you sang REO 
Speedwagon, I could not for the life 
of me understand how you were 
depicted as having any sort of “natu-
ral talent.” Lea Michele saves every 
one of your duets. Thank her.

Sorry Tina, whenever I watch 
you awkwardly do your thing on 
screen, I pray that the producers will 
sneak-replace you with somebody, 
anybody with more personality, like 
the infamous Becky switcheroo from 
“Roseanne.” Don’t worry, I don’t 
think the fans will notice. This is

Josh Tillman: Hold on let me turn the Tchaikovsky 
down a bit. 

The Guardian: How’s it going?
JT: Good, man. I’m just doing my morning pacing. I 

got bit by the proverbial dog last night, so I’m trying to 
remedy the bite with some hair from it that I collected. 

G: You’re playing at the Casbah on May 2nd. Is this 
the first show on the tour?

JT: Well it’s the first show in front of an audience. The 
night before, we’re doing Letterman or something. That 
will technically be the first show.

G: How do you feel going into it?
JT: I feel strong. I typically like to work by myself 

because I don’t really like people that much. But this tour 
is with a full band and all the dudes are great. And these 
tunes lend themselves to the live setting more than shit 
I’ve done in the past. Most of the records I’ve made don’t 
really make sense unless you’re alone in the pitch-black 
dark, listening to headphones with, like, a human skull 
with a candle on top of it. 

G: You’ve mentioned that you’re exploring new musi-
cal ground, and this is also your first release since you’ve 
left Fleet Foxes and ditched the J. Tillman name. Would 
you say this is a transitional record?

JT: I wouldn’t call you out on the transitional thing. 
I’d say the album was symptomatic of a larger, creative 
transition. Artists are people, and just like people they get 
a little older — they collect some new experiences, they 
collect some new realizations — and in order to be hon-
est, one has to reconcile with these things. That’s not a 
very sexy answer, but shit changes and shit gets older and

not the end of my rant, but this is 
the end of my space allotted. But I’ll 
leave on this note: When a show is 
given talent the likes of Lea Michele, 

Idina Menzel, Neil Patrick Harris 
and Kristin Chenoweth (notice how 
I deliberately left out the banshee 
named Gwyneth Paltrow), it cannot 
squander it on shoddy plotlines and 

half-assed character development. If 
the writers of “Spring Awakening,” 
“Wicked” and “Rent” aren’t already 
shaking their fists of fury at Glee, 
they should be.

shit gets wiser and shit gets less vain. 
G: I like the song “Hollywood 

Forever Cemetery Sings.” Would you 
call that your first single off Fear Fun?

JT: I mean, yeah, let’s call it a 
single, man. A fuckin single. Let’s call 
it a hit single.

G: I think that honesty you’re talk-
ing about really comes through in the 
song, and you get a very clear image 
of you as the narrator. Is there a spe-
cific true story attached to that song? 

JT: Yeah. Well there’s only really 
one person in that album, and that’s 
Josh Tillman. That song is inspired 
by a few instances. One of which was, 
after being more or less estranged 
from my family for a decade, my dad’s 
dad dying. [My dad] called me when 
I was in the middle of a tour and 
just said, “Look, I don’t care where 
you are or what you’re doing, you 
are getting on a plane and coming to 
this funeral.” This was the first one 
I had attended, and I was just really 
unsettled by the culture of the funeral. 
It’s just an unbelievably anesthetized, 
white-wash treatment for commemo-
rating a fuckin life. It made me want 
to rip the place apart — just knock 
over the casket and go crazy. A couple 
months later I found myself at this 
party at a graveyard, and I ended up 
canoodling with some young lady. 
That was the first time I had been to a 
graveyard since that funeral, and I just 
felt like this is the real shit. No one at 
that funeral talked about the joy that 
the young version of my granddad got 
to feel when he was messing around 

with some beautiful 
girl.

G: I think for 
anyone that’s lost 
someone and been to 
a traditional funeral, 
that’s a totally relat-
able image. And you 
got to play that out in 
the music video for 
the song, where you 
have this character, 
played by “Parks and 
Recreations”’s Aubrey 
Plaza, just trashing a 
funeral and kicking 
shit over.

JT: Yeah, I met 
Aubrey at a party, 
and she asked me 
to come do a walk-
on sort of thing in 
this movie she was 
doing, but I was on tour. And then 
I just started thinking, well I would 
really like to work with Aubrey. She’s 
funny but she also has this under-
current of melancholy and border-
line anger. To me, those are the fun-
niest people. You don’t have to listen 
to much of my music to realize that’s 
what I’m into. So I wanted Aubrey 
to come play me in this video. And 
she just brought this really cathartic 
performance to it. 

G: I read that you’re working on 
a project with Matthew Houck of 
Phosphorescent.

JT: Well... Matthew and I — you 
could describe us as running buddies. 
We like to go make mistakes together. 

We just have this open conversation 
that one day we’re going to make this 
duet album [laughs]. There are no 
official plans, but it will happen. Mark 
my word.  

G: Anything else in the works?
JT: Right now I’m really getting 

into this video thing. I got to work 
with John Ennis from “Mr. Show” and 
I’ve just done a lot of comedy and film 
stuff lately, kind of out of nowhere. 
We’re going to do an animated video. 
It’s in the early phases, so I don’t want 
to spoil the surprise, but it’ll be in 
that Adult Swim world of animation. 
I’m a big fan of that shit. Father John 
Misty will perform at the Casbah on 
Wednesday, May 2. Har Mar Superstar 
is set to open. $12 at the door.

MOVIE REVIEW

The Endless Bummer
Rom-com fails to launch.
Brana Vlasic • 
Contributing Writer

I t’s easy to divorce from “The Five-Year Engagement.”Dumping his promising sous chef career 
for his fiancée’s future, Tom Solomon (Jason 
Segel) must take a job in a lowly sandwich shop. 

“Watching you chop onions is like watching 
Michael Jordan take a shit,” his co-worker said. 

Snowy Michigan is a downgrade for Tom, 
both in his professional 
and personal life, which 
is essentially the endless 
recurring theme of “Get 
Him to the Greek” director 
Nicholas Stoller’s strained-
love rom-com, “The Five-
Year Engagement.” 

Tom and fiance Violet Barnes’ (Emily 
Blunt) relationship takes a turn after Violet is 
accepted into a social psychology program at 
the University of Michigan. And while Violet is 
enjoying her research on stale donuts and emo-
tional behavior, her future husband is forced to 
make a few changes. 

Though the subject matter is a bit of retread, 
“The Five-Year Engagement” manages to stir the 
plot with a somewhat unconventional narrative, 
placing Tom in the shoes of an in-over-his-head 
wedding planner. And, like the sandwich shop, 
Tom’s new coworkers are lovably scruffy, creating 
the rare moments of real, endearing humor that the film craves. 

Thematically, the film aims to place a fresh take on the usual arsenal 
of rom-com tropes: the difference between men and women, the dif-
ficulty of communicating, the value of marriage and so on. Often, it 
works. In one memorable scene, Tom’s overworked, lesbian chef bluntly 
says, “I voted against gay marriage because I think marriage is stupid.”

But even though the story isn’t complicated, it’s too often draining. 
The funny moments, like the conversation between Violet and her sis-
ter in which Violet’s niece makes them talk like Elmo and the Cookie 
Monster, are consistently outnumbered by obvious plot movements 
and try-hard jokes that fall flat. Those expecting the goofy, off-the-cuff 
antics of Marshall from “How I Met Your Mother” will likely be disap-

pointed at how little opportunity Segel is given to exercise his typecast 
brand of humor. 

With the many ups and downs, the couple’s relationship of course 
succeeds in the end. The film inevitably ditches any attempt at creat-
ing a realistic conclusion to a relationship adrift, and the film seems to 
end on the assuring note that the guy who was only an “eight” will stick 
around after you realize there aren’t any “10”s out there. Like Violet’s 
sister says: “You just need to pick one and take a bite.”

Fitting, then, that the most satisfying part of the “The Five-Year 
Engagement” was the finale. The quick, last-minute wedding scene 
sparks the biggest guilty-pleasure smiles, before condemning “The 
Five-Year Engagement” to the grave of instantly forgettable romantic 
comedies.

ALBUM REVIEW

T hough crit-ics once 
tried to peg 
Santigold as an 
R&B “rapper,” 
she has been 
more accurately 
praised as a non-
conformist — 
somebody who 
spans genres and 
uncharted territory with a diverse use of styles 
and instruments. 

This, of course, was after her debut in 2008, 
and the state of music has gone through many 
unexpected changes since then. Santi addresses 
these changes on Master of My Make-Believe, dis-
playing her ability to remain fascinating and inno-
vative in the face of a changing cultural climate.

Case in point: “Look At These Hoes” begins 
with fierce rapping akin to Nicki Minaj, stereo-
typical cash register noises, and of course, calling 
females ‘hoes’    — all of which put mainstream pop 
and rap music on blast while ironically sound-
ing just like it. “Freak Like Me” also could be the 
down and dirty dance anthem of summer 2012 
with its grinding tempo and repetitive chorus.

“Disparate Youth”, the second single of the 
record, starts with staccato beats over speedy 
drum and bass, and a layering of quick guitar riffs 
and subdued vocals delivering mellow ‘ohh ahhs’. 
This track stands out as a revolutionary song 
inspired by worldwide riots and the uprisings 
gripping youths in many countries and through-
out the Internet.

In general, Master of My Make Believe has a 
more serious and solemn tone than her fun debut, 
but this has prevented Santigold from getting left 
behind by mainstream copy-cat acts. Though she 
might currently be on tour with the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers, Santigold is always throwing us curve-
balls and keeping us curious, but more important-
ly, marching to the beat of her own mantra.

triple to right center for three RBI.
In the bottom of the fifth inning, 

Monterey pitcher Kylie Linnane went 
cold, walking two and allowing five 
bases on two wild pitches. Linnane 
was relieved in favor of Reinhardt, 
but not before allowing four runs.

With the game tied at five, the 
Otters picked up another run in the 
seventh. UCSD had no response in its 
last at-bat.

GAME 3
UCSD 3, MONTEREY BAY 5 

Swanberg, batting cleanup, singled 
with two men on base for two RBI. 
Up 2-0, the Otters took one back in 

the top of the second inning on two 
Triton errors. 

In the third inning, Monterey 
recorded three runs to take the lead. 
UCSD tied it up in the bottom of the 
third inning off an RBI from Brown, 
but the Otters took a one-run lead 
in the top of the seventh inning. 
With Reinhardt closing, UCSD had 
no response in the clutch, as the 
righthander retired the next three 
Tritons in order.

GAME 4
UCSD 4, MONTEREY BAY 5

The Tritons fell in another close 
match, going down by four runs early. 

The Otters’ Nina Villanueva, who 

has a .462 batting average, hit her 
ninth homerun of the season in her 
first at-bat. Up 2-0, the Otters put the 
Tritons back by two more runs in the 
second inning. 

Lesovsky recorded an RBI in 
the third inning to bring McQuaid 
into score. From there, Brown and 
Romero both doubled to record two 
more runs in the bottom of the fourth 
inning. 

Freshman Maria Sykes singled 
through the right side in the sixth 
inning to score another Triton, but 
it was still too little too late, as the 
Otters took the 5-4 win.

of second baseman Spencer Frazier, 
as he flied out to bring home third 
baseman Sam Michaels. 

Jeff Rauh picked up his third 
loss of the season, making his 
record 3-4 in season after only 
three and one-third innings.

“We played bad, we were 
outplayed in every aspect, and 
some days that will happen to you,” 
Newman said. “But what really 
matters is what you’re going to do 
the next day.”

 
GAME 3

UCSD 8, SAN BERNADINO 4 

The next day was a huge 
turnaround for the Tritons. Despite 
giving up nine hits, senior Greg 
Selarz picked up his fourth win of 
the year on two base-on-balls and 
one strikeout.

On their home turf, the Tritons 

got the jump on the Coyotes in the 
first inning, scoring three runs. 
Junior Nick LaFace batted in first 
baseman Richard Siegel, while right 
fielder Scott Liske hit his first of 
three singles to bring in LaFace.

The rest of the day was a battle 
between the two teams, with Elias 
Tuma picking up the save for the 
Tritons, facing ten batters over 
three innings and giving up only 
one hit. 

UCSD closed the door in the 
seventh inning, with the game close 
at 6-4. The Tritons scored two runs 
as Seigel ran out an infield single to 
start the rally. 

Left fielder Justin Rahn had a 
good game, going two for three and 
tallying two RBIs. 

GAME 4
UCSD 5, SAN BERNADINO 2 

In the last game of the series on 

Saturday, the Tritons took the early 
lead and never looked back. 

The Tritons snuck in one run in 
the first inning, as Susdorf hit an 
impressive shot to center to land 
him on third. 

From there Susdorf stole home.
Both teams held steady until the 

fifth inning, when the Tritons bats 
came alive. 

Susdorf hit another shot to 
leftfield for a double, while Seigel 
doubled to left center for two 
RBIs.      

After the Triton power play, 
UCSD bunted Tuck to third. Rahn 
then singled down the right field 
line to score Tuck to put the Tritons 
up 5-2.

The Coyotes were unable to cut 
the deficit, and the Tritons went 
away with the win.

Baseball Splits Home 
and Away Series

BY NICK HOWE
Associate Sports Editor

GAME 1 
UCSD 2, SAN BERNARDINO 3

 
In the first game of the four 

game series on Thursday, April 19, 
senior pitcher Tony York picked up 
his first loss of the season. 

Neither team scored until 
the fifth inning, when CSU San 
Bernardino right fielder Edwin 
Mendoza doubled down the right 
field line to start a rally that ended 
with two runs for the Coyotes. 

The Tritons responded with 
runs in the eighth and ninth 
innings off a wild pitch and an 
infield error, but it wasn’t enough 
to take the win. 

The Coyotes manufactured 
their winning run off substitutions 
ending with catcher Paul 
Eschleman knocking a walk off 
single to right field. 

“I thought we showed a lot of 
character today,” UCSD head coach 
Eric Newman said. “They came 
out here with some resolve, that 
they were going to fight and they 

were going to fight through the 
adversity, whatever came their way 
and they really did. 

They answered every time, and 
that’s the mark of a team that’s 
starting to grow up. I was excited to 
see that.”

Danny Susdorf had a good day 
at the plate, going three for four. 
No one else on the roster recorded 
more than one hit.

GAME 2
UCSD 4, SAN BERNARDINO 14

Friday’s game in San Bernardino 
proved to be one of the worst losses 
of the year for the Tritons, who 
were on the receiving end of two 
Coyote rallies that put the game out 
of reach. 

The third inning saw four 
unanswered runs as the Coyotes 
batted around the entire lineup. 
The fourth inning ended in much 
of the same way, as San Bernardino 
went up 9-0.

The Tritons rallied in the fourth 
inning, scoring one run off the bat 

Softball Falls in Four-Game 
Series to No. 7 Monterey Bay
BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor

SOFTBALL — The No. 24 UCSD 
Softball team was swept for the 
first time in program history last 
weekend, April 20 to 21 against No. 
7 Cal State Monterey Bay. 

The Otters sit at the top of 
the CCAA standings, with a 27-7 
conference record. Monterey Bay 
closed out its regular season, sharing 
the conference title with 27-7 Cal 
State Dominguez Hills.

“We never gave up, 
unfortunately, we just came up 
short,” UCSD head coach Patti 
Gerckens said. “That was frustrating. 
You could see that we were in it, but 
Monterey just had a little more than 
we had.”

Despite losing their last four 
CCAA matches and playing without 
the aid of Triton starters senior 
Tess Granath, junior Dyanna Imoto 
and Taylor Sepulveda, the Tritons 
clinched the fourth spot in the 
conference tournament.

The Tritons also tied their 
program record by placing six 
Tritons on the All-CCAA team. 
Senior centerfielder Kris Lesovsky, 
senior pitcher Camille Gaito and 
sophomore designated player Charly 
Swanberg were all named to the first 

team. Sophomores Caitlin Brown, 
Kirsten Willmon and Mya Romero 
were all named to the second team. 

UCSD’s opening match will be 
against second-seed Dominguez 
Hills this Friday, April 27 at Arnaiz 
Stadium in Stockton, Calif. 

“At this point in the season you 
know pretty much what you have 
to do,” Gerckens said. “You can’t 
change a whole lot physically; you 
have to go in mentally tough and 
you have to work smarter, and so 
that’s what our goal’s going to be this 
weekend.”

The last time UCSD met with the 
Toros was back in the beginning of 
March, where they took three games 
in the four-game series. 

“I think [we’ll] be ready to work 
hard come Monday,” Gerckens said. 
“In tournaments we always rise up a 
little more.”

GAME 1
UCSD 0, MONTEREY BAY 5 

The Tritons went down early as 
the Otters picked up three runs in 
the second inning. With two outs 
and two men on base, Monterey 
Bay’s Angelina Orozco tripled to 
right center for two RBI. Orozco was 
brought in to score in the Otters’ 
next at-bat, off a single from Jamie 

Moon.
Up 4-0, the Otters kept the bats 

hot as Moon picked up her second 
RBI with a double to secure the win.

“Monterey’s a great team,” 
Gerckens said. “They hit the ball 
hard, they hit the ball when they 
needed to and they score runs...and 
we just did not swing our bats and 
that’s what’s going to get hits.” 

Monterey righthander Cori 
Reinhardt went the distance to pick 
up her 18th win of the season.

GAME 2
UCSD 5, MONTEREY BAY 6 

In the second game of the series, 
the Tritons were a little better in the 
box. 

Monterey took the early lead in 
the first inning, but the Tritons were 
able to equalize off a single from 
Brown that brought Lesovsky into 
score.

The Otters picked up another 
run in the top of the second inning 
to reclaim the lead. Junior pitcher 
Jennifer Manuel did well to keep the 
game close until in the fifth inning, 
Reinhardt — the Monterey ace and 
the Otter with the highest slugging 
percentage on the roster — drilled a

The UCSD Golf team finished its regular season this week, April 23 to 24 at the Hunter Ranch 
Golf Course in Paso Robles, Calif.

The Tritons, who have struggled 
this season with the youth of their 
squad, placed 11th out of 20 squads last 
weekend at the 39th Annual Hanny/
Stanislaus Invitational. But in the last 
meet of their regular season, the Tritons 
carded a tremendous score of 866, the 
lowest result in UCSD’s 12 years of 
membership in the CCAA. 

 UCSD finished third in a field of 
eight teams, behind No. 7 nationally 
ranked Chico State and Cal State 
Stanislaus, and just two points ahead of 
fourth place No. 6 Cal State Monterey 
Bay. 

Freshman Jay Lim was the top 
finisher for the Tritons with a score of 
211, just one point behind first place — 
a three-way tie between Chico State’s 
Kyle Souza and Eric Frazzetta and Cal 
State Monterey Bay’s Alex Sobstad. Lim 
finished five under par, tied for fourth 
place with Cal State Stanislaus’ Rob 
Damschen. 

“[Lim] shot 66 with a double in the 
last round so it could have been even 
better, but his performance led the way 
for us and motivated the others to keep 
their rounds together,” Okasaki said.

Sophomore Jacob Williams carded 
the second lowest score for the Tritons, 
finishing one under par with a score of 
215, good for eighth place. 

“[Williams] played great the first 
day and struggled in round three, but 
held his round together for us just 
enough to move into third,” Okasaki 

said.
The third place finish was not only 

UCSD’s best showing at the CCAA 
tournament, but it may also qualify the 
team to advance to the NCAA Division 
II Super Regional. The field will be 
announced later this week.

“The team played very well, 
especially under pressure in the last 
round, knowing the importance 
of staying ahead of East Bay and 
Sonoma to get to Regionals,” Okasaki 
said. “Overall a great performance 
from everyone that should get us to 
regionals.” 

The Tritons are currently ranked 
No. 10 in the West Region, and 
have not qualified for the national 
tournament since 2007.
