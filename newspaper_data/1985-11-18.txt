Regents denounce 
PhDs at CSUs 

A plan by the state umversity 
trustees to grant doctoral degrees 
at some Cal tate Umverslties IS 
unreasonable and "divisive," the 
UC Regents said at their meeting 
in Los Angeles Thursday. 

If there is a need for more 
doctoral degrees they should be 
instated in the UC system, UC 
President David Gardner said . 
Expanding the CSUs in this way, 
Gardner said , is "a radical 
departure from .,. the Master 
Plan for Higher Education." 

CSU Chancellor W. Ann 
Reynolds said there is "clearly" a 
demand for a doctorate in 
education, which the state 
universities would grant. 

The trustees also plan to raise 

admiSSIOn standards from SIX 
college preparatory courses to 15, 
in addition to requiring 
membership in the top one-third 
of one's high school class.

part of an international 
campaign by arms control and 
peace groups for a nuclear 
testing ban by the United States 
which matches the unilateral

Some suggestio~s on anniversaty day 
What 25 years means to a marriage of love and endurance is what a 

quarter of a century of perseveran e and commitment signifies to the 
communitie of La Jolla and UC D. Today we cclehrate an anniversary 
)f m1l1ds - one of inquisitiveness. one of amhitlon, one of hope - a 
~.Hhenng of ,\0 intelligent peCH? at time commmed toward human 
progress Toda) we \\J!l pralT our elves \\'lth eloquent speeches, gorge 
L1urselvcs on mounds of food , give champagne roast to our appOinted 
fIgureheads and yen heers for C D' most generous patrons. From an 
old dust)' mesa with clapboard military harracks being its only 19n of 
hfe, UC D has grown into a bustlmg yet serene mall cit)'. whose 
l11habltant boa t real ansfa tion with being part of one of America's 
' fInest unlversitie" UC D had certainly come a long way in its sh n 
hIStory, and is justified in feelmg proud of its accompli hmcnrs. 
However, bemg an integral part of univcr ity progress, we would like to 
offer a few piece of ad V! c on how thIS univerSity might achieve the 
worthy distinctlon of being the best all-around unlversity in the ountry. 

UC D IS still thought 01 by the outside world , and perhaps rightly so, 
as bemg primarily a top rc earch university. We prese nt to our potential 

fa~ult)' and student applicants institutional qualification that brag of 
UC D's eight Nobcllaureates, our 47 members f the ational Academy 
of Clen e, our widely acclaimed authors who al 0 spend time lecturing, 
and the Sixth-highest amount of federal research grants and contracts 
received m the county. We take our potential participants/ donors on 
tours of the world-famous cripps Institute of Oceanography, the Salk 
Institute of miraculous medi al research, the beautiful eucalyptus groves, 
the bluffs over Torrey Pines, around the Revelle Fountain . There can be 
no doubt that UCSD has enough prestige locked into its campus 
grounds to boggle and bedazzle the most skeptical observer. But what, 
may we ask, has become of the university'S most overlooked participant 
in these 25 years? What has happened to the role of the undergraduate 
in all of this hype and merrymaking? 

For the past few months we have read the local mass-media give 
many different accounts of UC D's 25 year procession to the unique 
positlon 1t holds today in the San Diego community. What we found 
severely lacking in their analysis, and what we submit to be UCSD's 
most pressing problem of the day, is the almost nominal role given to 

Ann Simonton's about Lace 

undergraduates in the univer ity decision-making process. We believe 
our lackluster position as students can be explained by three overriding 
factor : First, the resear h-oriented bias of both the administration and 
faculty which does not lend itself to the "free and open exchange of 
idea" that 1 so intrlnsic to a young university's positive peripheral 
growth, econd , the univer iry's overemphasis of the "hard" sciences and 
lack of sufficcnr training in the humanities for those "hard" cience 
1l1.lJors. (whICh has lead the soclal sCIence and liberal arts student to he 
C.lSt as .1 Ie s-ambitious, and largely ignored minority); third , the failure 
of undergraduates themselves to consistently organize around those 
issues that appear to be "beyond" our grasp. These three sore spots in 
our history only touch on the plethora of smaller problems which have 
been put on the back burner so that the unive rsity could address what 
they believed to be more immediate dilemmas. However. in order to 
broaden the scope of UCSD and improve the community's overall 
performance, we would encourage the university's future "planners" to 
entertain these suggestions. 

The imple mentation of cooperative housing on campus would be a 
constructive first step in the necessary development of a definable , on-
campus culture. So that we could all come to appreciate the diversity of 
UCSD culture, we would ask that the administration increase its 
recruitment of minorities from all class backgrounds. A rapid movement 
away from the "hard" sc iences to a more eqUitable concentration on the 
liberal arts and social sciences would vastly improve the type of student 
that graduates from UCSD - as her exposure to a variety of student 
characters would surely complement her learning process. We would also 
like to see improved realtions bewteen students and faculty members (a 
mandatory year of TEP for professors might no t hurt), a more selective 
search process for teaching assistants, and a new university center that 
will not resemble a shopping mall. Finally, we implore the 
administration to grant more accredited on-campus internships to 
students who wish to work more fully with student organizations. On a 
more personal note , the establishment of a UCSD Graduate School of 
Journalism would please many writers, who labor tirelessly without 
recognition, and without a support base. Cheers UCSD, and here's to a 
better tom morrow!

AN SIMa TO , former fashion model and current co-founder of 
Aedia Watch, presented her 
lide show "From Model 10 
~ilitant" on campus last 
Vednesday night. In this

nanner in which advertising,

against women. Ann's modeling 
career, which she began at the 
age of 14, was not daunted 
when , on June 24, 1971 , Ann 
was raped by three men at kmfe 
point. In fact, the rape 
experience made her more 
determined than ever to make 
money, thereby securing herself 
from dependence on men. It 

wasn't until eight years later that

the eye of the camera. realized 
that modeling, like prostitution, 
is nothing more than the selling 
of one's body. Her life hasn't 
been the same since. 

The average American sees 
500 advertisements and watches 
seven and a half hours of 

television per day. This 
bombardment of media images, 
Ann contends, inevitably affects 
the perceptions and behavior of 
both men and women . In these 
advertisements, women are 
portrayed as being pre-occupied 
with trivial things such as fabric 
softeners and meat tenderizers. 
They are shown 10 have only 
mundane and unimponant 

things to do with their time. 
Often, women are placed 
physically lower than men and 
are therefore unable to see men 
eye to eye - a symbolic 
representation of the relative 
pos itions of men and women in 
sociery. Succ('ss for women 
means physical attractiveness; 
the repercussions of this are

In regards to your November 
1 editonal exposing /IS 
ompliciry 10 their attempt 10 
ounteract the expressed desire s 
f UCSD students in banning 
IA recruitment on campus, I 
lUSt give my overwhelming 
lppOrt for your continUing 
xposure of these miscreant 
buses of authonry. 

The apparent disdain that the 
5 and the /ISla hold for student 
pinion IS all 100 common, and 

IS a reflection of the masters they 
serve (the admmistration). 

These so called represe nta!lves 
of lhe student body must be 
forced to obey the students by 
either the coercIO n of the pen, or 
by the boot. In thiS case (luckily 
fo r them), It was by the pen , but 
If the /IS continues in these 
actions of complete ignorance of 
student opinion , then the 
obvious must be done - they 
must be "booted" out, and people 
truly concerned with 
representing the will of the 
students must be IOstalled . We as 
students must no longer put up 
with these opportunists. 

V. Garibaldi 

Editor. 
We are writing thiS letter In 

response to Mr. Cronin 's 
edItonal. "The /IS Waves O ff a 
Referendum" In the ovember 11 
issue. Although it was not your 
primary motive , thiS editorial 
tarnished the image of the ASIa 
We believe that the editorial was 
slanted and was an overreaction 
to what was a minor incident. 

The /ISla offers a diverse 
selection of internships which 
embodies the spectrum of 
students here at UCSD. 
Therefore , we carry internships 
which renect a varlery of often 
conniCllng political viewpoi nts, 
which included those of the CIA. 
In no way docs the ASIa have 
any politlcal affiliation , as was 
alluded to 10 your editorial. 

There are other reasons why 
we feel the CIA internship lIstlOg 

was a minor incident. First ot aU , 
in the four years that we carried 
the lisllng, no one ever applied 
to the specific internship 
Secondly. our contact with the 
CIA during this period was 
minimal: It came 10 the form of a 
si ngle letter to update the 
Internship. Therefore , the total 
amount of student activity fees 
used to finance this specious 
contact came to a grand total of 
204: . However, from the tone of 
your editorial, one would infer 
that we had spent an amount 
much greater than this . 

The limited advertising our 
office does IS simply 10 stimulte 
student interest In our program. 
Yes, we publiCize specific 
Internships. as was done With 
the flyer In question . Yet thiS 

publicity is deSigned to give a 
sampling of the internships our 
program has to offer. 

The refe rendum passed last 
spring quancr banned the use of 
student registration fees towards 
on-campus recruitment by the 
CIA and various other 
government organizations. We 
admit that we carried the CIA 
internship. However, we did not 
be lieve that this was "lawless 
sponsorship ." We didn't 
interpret the spring 1985 
referendum as pertaining to our 
office for we have always felt that 
we are not a source for on-
campus recruitment. Regardless 
of this, we have removed the 
Internship from our listings We 
regret that you misinterpreted

instances abound .

clearly visible in the form of 
eating disorders. At least 35 
percent of coUege-aged women 
are bulimic, 10 percent are 
anorexic. The epidemic 
proportions of these diseases are 
undoubtedly a product of the 
"beaury ideal" we see everywhere 
around us. 

Women are often 
dismembered or depicted as 
homogeneous creatures to be 
judged like animals. The impact 
of this de-humanization of 
women is shockingly illustrated 
by rapists who claim that "they 
do not think of their victims as 
people." Our sociery's obsession 
with youth and the erasure of 
any sign of womanhood has led 
to the ponrayal of children as 
seductive and sexual beings. The 
implications and ramifications of 
this are frightening. According to 
Ann, the roots of beaury pageants 
also lie in the manipulabiliry of. 
and empha~is on a woman's 
appearance. These pagean~, 
which exist for children as well 
as women, encourage the 
objectification and subjugation of 
women in an attempt to 
maximize profits; given that 
women are responsible for 85 . 
percent of consumption in this 
country, the more "needs' that 
can be created for women, the . 
better. 

While advertising and beaury 
pageants misrepresent women, 
pornography more ovenly 
encourages violence against 
women. In magazines such as 
Hustler, Playboy and Penthouse, 

women are commonly portrayed 
as victims of violence and rape 
- and are often depicted as 
enjoying the violence. This 
violence is glamourized; the pain 
and anguish of abuse and rape 
are ignored. In a sociery where 
50 percent of women will at 
some point' be beaten by their 
husbands and one out of three 
women are attacked, abuse is 
nothing to be rrivialized. Playboy 
and Pmthouse have over 50 
million readers each; many of 
rhese readers are boys and 
adolescents. These males are 
learning that violence is 
provocative and rape is a sensual 
experience. Such publications 
also encourage child abuse: 
Hustler magazine regularly 
features a cartoon strip called 
"Chester Molester" in which 
various sorts of child abuse are 
(humorously?) depicted . 

That this sort of violence 
against women is emulated 
cannot be denied. Three months 
prior to the infamous Bedford 
rape (in which a woman was 
raped by several men on a pool 
table while others stood by), 
Penthouse magazine reatured a 
graphic rape scene involving one 
woman and several men on a 
pool table. Last December's issue 
of Pmthouse contained a series 
or photos involving young, Asian 
remales held in bondage; only 
rwo months later, an eight year 
old girl was raped and found 
strung up in a tree - dead. 
Serial murderers have even taken 
to "making their own 
pornography" - filming the rape 

The obvious connection 
berween the objectification and 
de-humanization of women in 
advertising, beaury pageants and 
pornography and violence 
against women has led Ann 
Simonton in her charge that 
"women must take control of 
their bodies." Ann sees education 
as the most important tool in her 
war on Violence against women . 
She hopes to teach people to 
become more sensitive [0 the 
images of women that surround 
them, and expose the methods 
in which advertisers instill in the 
p\lblic an insatiable desire for 
consumption. Ann also strives to 
exterminate puritanical attitudes 
toward women and sexuality 
through sex education , claiming 
that pornography depends on 
the existence of these attitudes 
for its survival ("the forbidden 
fru it can be sold "). I n her 
attempt to encourage media 
responsibiliry. Ann has co-
founded Media Watch -
citizens for media reponsibiliry 
without law. This group has 
taken step such as informing 
the stockholders 01 Meredun 
Corporation that said 
corporation is responsible for the 
printing of Penthouse magazine 
- a fact about which they were 
previously deluded. Lastly. Ann 
advocates acts of civil 
disobedience in protest of 
violence against women. Ann has 
organized the "Myth California" 
protests of Miss California 
pageants for five years; the result 
of this protest being that for the 
first time in 62 years, that 
pageant will not be held in Santa

"Women must lake control of their bodies" - Ann Simonton 
Cruz, but right here in San and artacks the very premise 
Diego. Ann encourages women to upon which the moral majoriry 
make the statement, "My body is bases its opposition to 
my own" by learning nO{ to pomography (that sex is 
blame themselves for having obscene). Ann's personal 
internalized some of the ideas experience as a model , rape 
which are pan of our victim and activist made her 
socialization process and which presentation an especially 
surround us daily. Instead, interesting and persuasive one. 
women must learn to tum their Ann's devotion to her cause is 
anger outward, as self-defense clearly a result of her personal 
rests on the notion that we are conviction and compassion. 
worth saving. Even in the midst of her banle, 

In its opposition to Ann has managed to keep a 
pornography. Media Watch does balanced perspective and a sense 
not align itself with such groups of humor. In the end , it is these 
as the moral majoriry. Ann is last rwo weapons that may prove 
staunchly opposed to censorship to be the most useful. ~

Editor: 

I am wnting to you in 
response to AS PreSident 
Alexander's Introduced resolution 
to ban CIA intemships offered 
by the AS Intern.;hlp Office 

I find thiS resolution [0 be 
diS nmmatory and a form of 
censorShip. Although ir may he 
argued that the CIA engages 111 
activities With whIch students 
may disagree. It certaml)' does 
not mean that thiS organization 
should be prevented from 
disseminating ItS information 
and point of view. tudents 
should be able to make choices 

of which mternshlPs they will or 
Will not take advantage of. 

Banning the CIA internship 
from campus WIll set a dangerous 
precedent. Will students Simply 
be allowed to ban any 
organization that wishes to 
expose a controversial message? 
Should we ban internships 
offered by the enti re government 
because we do not believe in the 
polities of the current 
administration? If the CIA has 
broken any federal laws, thcn it 
is up to the ouns to decide. To 
Simply ban them because we 
disagree with their role in 
government. IS to destroy free 
expressIOn. 

The very nature of the teml 
university means learnll1g to 
evaluate dlffenng opmlons and 
poSSible opponunmcs 
Internships are a foml of career 
gUidance It IS the role of 
educauon to offer students the 
broadest possible exposure so as 
to ensure that deCISions that are 
madc are based on a complete 
understanding of aU options . 

I would agree that the June 
referendum was a way to let 
student know that the CIA is 
involved in many controversial 
government poliCies, but that IS 
as far a the referendum should 
go. Students know where the CIA 
stands, and now the choice is up 
to each individual. By banning 
the CIA internship students are 
only getting one message. 

I urge you, the Council, to vote 
against this resolution . In 
addition , your comments on thiS 
Issue would be greatly 
appreciated.

Cash Crusaders 
Editor: 

I have come [0 the conclusion 
that Jesus has found the business 
of real estate development much 
more lucrative that the saving of 
souls. I came [0 this deciSIOn in 
retrospect of the Campus 
Crusade fo r Christ's recent 
funneling of $217,000 in so 
called "non-minIstry" funding 
toward the (unsuccessful) defeat 
of the proposition A. slow growth 
initiative. 

I suppose it is only logical that 

these Campus Crusaders would 
want to defeat such a slow 
growth initiative; more 
households means more dollars 
in the Sunday morning collection 
plate - $217,000 out of the 
mouths of the needy is nothing 
when one considers the profits 
to be reaped from suburban 
sprawl to all horizons. Such is 
the way of our friendly God 
vendors. 

I can only hope that someone 
will nonfy me when Jesus 
decides to resume his old 
occupation. I will be able to sleep 
muc h more soundly at night 
knowing that "our savior" has 
resumed his watch over me and 
is no longer so preoccupied with 
increasing his bank account.

Rape: Students protest, seek solutions 
By RACHEL fREI FE~DER 

Approximately 200 students 
gathered at noon Wednesday at 
a ra lly enti tled "Take Back Our 
Lives." intended to increase 
awareness of rape Speake rs 
Included [ormer model Ann 
SIITIonton, self defense instructor 
Betry Brooks and health 
professional Z. Kripke. 

Simonton. who for the past 5 
years has protested the Miss 
California Pageant held in Santa 
Cruz Ince 1923. related the 
experiences of several rapc 
VIctims. Indudtng herself. and 
spoke on popular media Images 
of women and of rape. She 
referred to horror fIlms that 
feature "scantily clad women 
running from a killer" and to the 
December issue of Pcnth ou~e, 
which portrays prepubescent 
Asian girls bound to trees and 
rocks , "looking like they're dead ." 
imonton said. 
"This glamorized image of 

violence ... is normahzed to the 
point that we lhtnk it's really 
okay," Simonton said. 

Rape should receive the same 
negative publici ty as violence in 
Nicaragua, Hiroshima and 
Vietnam, including realistic 
pomayals of the brutality of rape, 
Simonton said . "We don't see 
pictures of a woman who's been 
raped and stabbed and thrown 
in a ditch ... I think wc'd be 
homfied to see what happens to 
women and children ." 

She said she would like to

si tuations where the only

be known as an abuser of 
women ... .' Think of what it's 
doing [0 the trust between men 
and women. We lose a lot by not 
being able to look our panner in 
the eye as an equal." 

Brooks discussed "popular 
myths" and statistics on rape . 
"The twO biggest myths are. for 
women. 'It won't happen to me: 
and for men, 'I'm not a rapist.' 
Well , one in three women will be 
raped or sexually assaulted. and 
statistics show that 70 percent of 

men would rape in some 
circumstances." she said. 

Rape does not always happen 
in a "dark alley" with a stranger, 
and IS not a sexual cnme, Brooks 
said SIX[}' percent of rapes arc 
planned. 50 percent occur in a 
woman's own home. and 80 
percent of rapiSts carry a 
weapon . Rape IS a crime of 
viole nce. accord ing [0 Brooks 
and Kripke. Rape victims are not 
always young women; they range 
in age from four to 92 years. and 
some men are raped by other 
men. Brooks said. She said one 

The Women's Chlllc offers 
counseling to female and male 
students on sex-related concerns. 

"I was surprised to learn that 
accord ing to Kripke's 
information . I've been raped 
several times." said Tracy 
Cubbins. another partiCipant. 

"Right now the environment I 
safe for the rapist." said Mary 
Virga. head of RPEP. "We need 
to dispel the myth that women 
\vant to be raped. that rape IS a 
sexual act." 

"Most people don't realize tha 
women constantly carry around 
this feeling that they're not safe. 
It's not fair that I can't do thing5 
alone that I want to, that I know 
men can do ... because I'm 
always afraid of betng raped ,"

Twenty-fifth anniversary series: 1961-1962 
York recalls UCSD's beginning 
By CHRISTOPHER CANOLE 

When the Regents of the 
University of California 
announced on ovember 18, 
1960, that a new campus would 
be named the University of 
California at San Diego, the local 
community rejoiced . ButJim 
Copley of the San DIego Union 
did not approve of the name, so 
he called it the University of 
Californla of La Jolla. Soon 
afterwards, in February of 1961 , 
Dr. Herben York's 25 year 
hislOry with UCSD began when 
university president Clark Kerr 
left that Regents' meeting and 
called York in WashingtOn to 
invite him to become UCSD's 
first chancellor. 

One of York's duties as 
chancellor was to deal with the 
press. His first complaint only 
yielded Copley's Switching the 
tide to the University of 
Cahfornla at La Jolla "When 1 
pointed out that was still not our 
name, they made it the 
University of California situated 
at La Jolla: York recalls, 

ugh lng, "For a whtle they called 
JS the UniverSIty of Califomla 
Here. i said to my WIfe Sybil that 
1 might go up to the University 
Hall at Berkeley and suggest they 
change our name 10 University 
of California Here so that we 
would be placed hIgher up In 
the alphabetical order of the 
University campuses, behind 
Davis and ahead of Irvine. ybil 
said that at Berkeley they would 
see the lssue from their position 
in Nonhem Californta and call 
us the University of CalifornIa 
There, thus putting us at the

trick to becoming world class 
was the notion of stanmg a 
regular campus at the graduate 
level: 

York agreed with Revelle's 
ideas in establishmg such a 
university. Revelle proposed to 
initiate the graduate level of the 
university first , thus ensuring 
that UCSD's research and 
graduate programs would gain 

did not exist, and five years later 
the bloom was off the rose. 
Everyone, including state 
legislators and ordinary voters, 
agreed we needed to expand 
higher education." The science-
oriented industries in San Diego, 
like General Atomics for 
example, envisioned UCSD as a 
facility that would provide future 
researchers. The people in La 
Jolla anticipated the university 
would bring more culture to the 
area. 

programs in those institutions. 
But hrre in the University of 
California, the faculty has the 
authority over the most 
interesting parts of the 
substance: the academic 
program, the recruiting of the 
faculty and the long-range 
planning." 

The cnancellor plays cI role in 
all of those things, but it is a role 
in which he usually is not given 
authority. His authonty is 
relegated to dealing with Regents , 
building parking lots and 
bookstores, on-campus housing, 

establishing a library and 
constructing other new faC Ilities 
(but inmost cases only after 
approval from the faculty senate). 

'The core substance of the 
university is in the hands of the 
faculry senate rather than the 
administration ," said York. "I 
believe this is an effective 
arrangement that produces 
excellent results. As member of 
the faculty I fully support it , but 
as the first chancellor I had not 
antici pated the position of the 
chancellor correctly." 

When York resigned in the fall 
of 1964, the San Diego City 
manager asked him where ~e 
would go from here. "I am not 
going anywhere," York answered. 
-1 am staying right here." When 

'" me city manager expressed great § surprise (after all, he would never 
~ consider stepping down from his 

~ manager's position to work for 
" the park department), York set 8 him straight on the univerSity's 

.£.' heirarchy. "Everyone in the 
general community thinks the 
chancellor is at the top . He IS in 
charge of the administration -
but that is not the university. 
The faculty themselves know that 
he posi tion of professor is the 
highest and mO:it noble in the 
university." 

In early November, 1963, York 
informed UC President Kerr of 
his intention to resign as 
chancellor. York called a special 
meeting of the depatment 
chairmen and academic deans in 
late November to present his 
move from chancellor to 
professor., "As I left my office for 
the meeting, 1 remarked to my 
secretaI)', 'I don't look fOJWard to 
the newspapers headlines saying 
YORK QUITS. I hope something

community, ··the other UC 
campuses saw us as a-
competitor: said York. 'The 
other young campuses like Santa 
Barbara and Davis resented what 
they thought was our privileged 
status here. Berkeley and UCLA 
always thought of themselves as 
being the twO giants among the 
six dwarfs. They saw UCSD as a 
threat to their dominance. We 
were getting the professors and 
graduate students they wanted." 

Talking with a 
chancellor's 'right antI' 

xmom of the list " 
York's playfulness in handling 

iuch idiosyncratic situations may 
nave disturbed people upon 
:>eing introduced to this youthful 
nan, who became our first 
:hancellor at the age of 39. His 
louth disguised the expenence 
1e brought to the university as 
In organizer. York was the first 
directOr of Lawrence Livennore 
Laboratories and the first 
director of the United States 
Defense Depanment of Research 
and Engineering. 

"From the begmning, my view 
was that we should create a first-
dass university more or less 
along the lines of Berkeley and 
mfiuenced by the ideas we 
mherited from Roger Revelle ," 
said York. "We had the 

ppoitunity to be fresh and new. 
We sought a good mix of 
undergraduates and graduates 
(rom all over me world, working 
In deparunents that would 
become world class. The real 

momentum and attract the finest 
people in all fields of study. 
ReveUe and hIS coDeagues had 
already recruited some of the 
best scientists in the country for 
me faculty: Nobel laureate Harold 
Urey, Maria Mayer (who became 
a Nobel laureate while at UCSD), 
Joseph Mayer, James Arnold, 
David Bonner and others. 

Then UC president, Clark Kerr 
willingly gave UCSD the 
resources necessary to reach 
those goals, which had a higher 
impact at UCSD due to its small 
number of students. "We had the 
money to get the best professors. 
The graduate studies and 
research started WIthout having a 
lot of undergraduates around and 
underfoot until the fall of 1964: 
said York. 

"As Revelle and I both point 
out, UCSD started at exactly the 
right time," aId York "Five years 
earlier the stimulus for more 
scienufic train ing caused by 
worldwide events like Sputnik 

The small number of students 
In the years between 1961 and 
the arrival of the first 
undergraduates in the fall of 
1964, presented some unique 
problems for our first chancellor. 
"We wanted to hold a regular 
graduation exercise. So few of 
that small handful of a hundred 
or so students actually graduated 
each year that we feared we 
could very well have a graduation 
without students. Therefore , 
rather man have a big ceremony 
to which no one would come, we 
decided to simply have a lawn 
party. No speeches were given, 
just a pleasant party in which 
students got more than their 
nonnal low amount of protein. 
The food was prepared by Avis 
Johnson , who has se/Ved every 
chancellor since men." 

As UCSD started taking shape, 
York realized the position of 
chancellor had secondary power 
on a UC campus. "In my 
previous positions as director of 
Livermore and director of the 
Defense Research and 
Engineering, my authOrity 
extended dlrecdy to the most 
interesting sub tance of the 

By EVA C. WONG 
During me early formation of 

UCSD, The UC Regents had 
intended to build a University 
House near the edge of the 
campus. The chancellor would 
reside at the house, and 
university-related functions 
would be held there. This plan 
never fermented, however, and 
instead , a house located on 
Pepita Way in La Jolla was 
purchased and se/Ved as a 
University House for UCSD's first 
five years. Over the past 25 
years, the location of the 
University House has changed 
numerous times. 

One woman who has worked 
at the University House during 
its many changeovers (spanning 
six chancellors) is Avis Johnson. 
Hired initially as the cook and 
housekeeper at the beginning of 
Herbert York's chancellorship, 
she is not only a UCSD volunteer 
at the International Center' 
Resale Shop, but sh" has also 
become part of the York fam ily. 
"I consider the York children as 
my own .. . we spent from 10 to 
15 Christmases together wh n 
the children were growing up, 
and now that they are grown we 

still continue to spend our 
Christmases together." 

Johnson worked in the 
University House for over 23 
years, during which time she was 
"involved in the planning and 
carrying out of almost all the 
events and functions" thrown at 
the Pepita Way house and 
subsequent university homes. She 
recalls me first function, which 
was held during Christmas time: 
"It was to get public 
understanding of UCSD and its 
goals .... We had to go around 
and tell the neighbors that we 
were having a party so there 
would be enough room for 
people to park their cars in the 
Pepita Way cul-de-sac .. . 20,30, 
at most only 50 people showed 
up." 

"The community was not at all 
happy with the development of 
UCSD," according to Johnson. 
"Most towns are happy at the 
idea of having an educational 
facility, but not La Jolla: She 
adds that "in certain stores in 
the Village in the begmning 
years, if you acknowledged you 
worked for UCSD, people would

make remarks such as, 'You're 
still working at that place?'" 

Now more than 20 years later, 
Johnson still believes the . 
community plays a critical role In 
UCSD and SIO expansion . .. 
"You'd think that in over 20 
years people would change ... I 
see this as progress in the wrong 
way. I believe advancement is 
nice for the university, and the 
advancement of La Jolla could be 
because of the university." 

campus since the layout has 
changed so much, I could just as 
easily ,¥alk into a tree as a new 
building." Johnson continues, 
"It's hard for me to recognize a 
familiar face as I walk around 
UCSD. I used to know everyone 
on the staff and their families ... 
one of the warmest feelings of 
friendliness I felt was when 
Frieda Urey said to me, 'Avis, 
since we'll be working together 
so closely and since I call you 
Avis , won't you please call me 
Frieda?' Here was this great 
woman , a wife of one of the top 
faculty, asking me, someone who 
started out at the University 
House as a cook, to call her by 
her first name." 

Johnson notes that one of the 
biggest changes she has 
witnessed over the past 25 years 
at UCSD is the growth of the 
campus, including the increased 
number of buildings, students 
and adminstrators. Johnson says, 
"Now, if I walk around the 

Johnson says that she has met 
many famous people because her 
job at the University House 
meant that a variety of people 
were accessible to her, and 
because her own "pushiness" 
helped to initiate introductions.

Getting caught somewhere in the middle 
By PHIL LAUDER . 

"What's yo name? 
Who 's yo daddy? ..... 

- some song from the '60s 

MIDDLE NAMES were an interesting idea. Not necessarily good , Just 
interesting. Originally intended 
to dtstinguish one john Smith 
from the 38 other john Smith 's 
in the white pages, their sole 
purpose nowadays seems to be 
to embarrass people or to give 
readers a few laughs while 
scanning through the local 
telephone directory. 

Most people aren't too pleased 
with their middle names. Does 
this sound familiar? "I see you 
sign your checks 'Lisa J' What 
does the T stand forr "None of 
your (bleep) business." Yes, a 
typical conversation between twO 
rypical casual friends on a -typical 
day at a ryp ical check-out 
counter at a rypical store nea r 
you Soon the conve rsation bo ils 
down to "I'll teU you mine If 
you'll tell me yours," and 
omeone fmally tells: 'James, 

huh ? That's a pretry stupid 
middle name ror a female." 
"Yeah, so what's yours?" 
"Antoinette." "My, aren 'f we 
gaudy?" snaps the first, and the 
two women get into first a 
shouting match and then a fist 
fight, all over their middle 

names. Hey, ) tell you, it's a 
typical scene Ihat happcns every 
day somewhere in America. 
Would I lie to you? 

So perhaps you haven't seen 
such a fist fight. You have seen > 
people who absolutely won't tell 
you their mtdd le names. It 
becomes a stupid little ace they 
can kee p up their leeve5 Just LO 
p iss you off, they won't te ll you 
whar their middle Inirial stands

not leI It get to you. "ChrISt, you 
can keep the damn thing a 
secret If rou want! I don't rcall}' 
care. In fact , I'm not the least bit 
interested In what your name 
IS.. . I don't need to know .... It 
doesn't matter at all ... dammlt to 
hell, what IS your name?" 

Mine, for your information, IS 
Alexander. I happen to like the 
name Alexander. Alexander is a 
Grear name, actually. Ha, ha. 
Sorry. 

Some people's middle names 
are, admittedly, poor excuses fo r 
names. A rriend of mine's is 
"Errwood " What rhe hell IS that? 
Sounds li ke something that 
washes up on the beach. Middle 
names like Biff and Hugo don't 
do a lot for a person's image, 
eilher. Male names like Gerald 
and Laurence and Thomas, wh ile 
not real origi nal, do the job 
nicely. Female names like Lynn

something. Bad scene. 
Middle names also give us 

another wonderful aspect or hfe: 
a set of initials. You may have 
figured mine to be PAL. Or you 
may have not ; In either case, 
that's what mine are -
wonderful initials , I think, and I 
let anyone stupid enough to ask 
my middle name know JUSt that. 
"What a pal," they' ll Joke, and 
we'll chuckle a few hearty gaffaws 
as one does on wonderful 
occas ions such as these. PAL 
beats the hell out of FUZ or BRP 
or JRK or RIP or several other 

sets of initials you can devise. 
Most initials are JUSt plain 
mea ningless: jGH, MjC, PCW, 
RLM - they Just don't do 
anything. Fortunately, these 
people probably really don't give 
a flying hell. 

On that note I shall end th is ~ 
analytical if not very intelligent 
diSCUSSIOn of middle names. I 
hope you've enjoyed it as much 
as I have, but I doubr It. By the 
way, what IS your name, and 
who IS your daddy, and why did 
I begin this anlcie with that

Volleyball finishes on a losing note 
By JOHN SCHACHT. ports Editor 

T HE 1985 WOMEN' volleyball team closed out their regular season FrIday 
with a loss to the Air Force 
Academy. a Di\~slOn 11 s hool. In 
a four game match. 12-15. 15-10, 
JO-IS, 12-15 

Concludmg \\1th a m.ltlh that 
coach Doug Danne\'lk l<llled 
Indicative" of the team's play 

,m(e Injuries to key players 
Carol Upson and :-'1arci Lischer, 
the Tntons led 8-0 In rhe fIrst 
game and 11-3 In the fourth. hut 
went on to lose both "The 
InJunes have really compounded 
our youth problems," saId 
Dannevlk. "and we Just have n't 
been able to close well " Cmng 
the la k of a "killer instinct" 
among his y'ounger players. and 
a rash of injuries, Dannevlk feels 
that the "lack of depth does not 
enable us to overcome our rookie 
mistakes We're not a solId club 
right now, and we've lost a 
number of games we should have 
won because of our depth 
problems. We've rarely had the 
same hneup in twO consecutive 
games." 

But 1985 has been a good 
"transition year," ac ordmg to 
Dannevik. "We're ranked eighth 
10 the nation in DiVISIon III ," he 
said, "and we are 14-2 versus 
other DIVISIon III schools, so I'm 
pleased w][h our performance on 
that level." The only twO losses 
w][hm theIr dIVISIOn came 
against llhnOlS Benedlctme and 
Colorado College both of whom 
are ranked in the tOP five In 
Division III "It 's been our 
performances agaInst some of 
the DIVISion 11 schoob that have 
hun us the most." he ~ald . 

Dannevik also decned the 
sporadIC performance of most of 
the players thIS year. "They're 
mostly young," he said. "but the

Ex-"friton southpaw 
drafted by Cardinals 

By ERICA GLENNON 

W HE UCSD student and left-handed pitcher Dave 
DeCordova watched the National 
League Championsh Ip series thIS 
year, he was a li ttle torn between 
who to roOt for. Being a die-hard 
Dodger fan all of his hfe, he 
hoped to see Tommy Lasorda's 
team claim the title . But 
something that happened on 
June 5 01 last year made him 
proud to see Whitey Herzog's 
Cardmals reach the World 
Series. Last june. Dave received a 
call from SI. Louis infoming him 
that he'd been drafted fo r their 
half·season single A team in Erie. 
Pennsylvania. Maybe Jack Clark's 
home run wasn't so bad , at least 
not for Dave. 

On june 15, just 10 days after 
he 'd learned he'd been drafted , 
Dave found hi mself in (dreary) 
Erie, Pennsylvania. He was put 
In a hotel for a few days and 
told to find a place to live. He 
managed to find a place with 
three other players that was 
relatively close to the field. Many 
fans o f baseball constantly 
complain about the salaries the 
major leaguers take home. Well 
most major leaguers put time in 
at the minor league level where 

starting pay for a single A player 
is a mere $700 a month. "Most 
everyone was having money 
problems," adm Its Dave. "they 
were having to write home for 
money .. Luckily. beer was 
cheap." Dave admits he was among 
the many players that found It 
dIfficult to live off the salary 
allotted . 

But money was not the major 
problem that players like Dave 
faced . The level of competition 
managed to humble quue a few 
hitters who were career .300 and 
above . "It's a tough time 
adjusting; it's a whole different 
level of competition. Many of the 
hit[ers weren't use to striking out. 
It took me a while to relax. to 
pitch how I knew I could . to not 
take i[ 100 senously," said 
DeCordova. He desc ribed the 
onset of his season as a poor 
start. but said that he got 
stronger as the season 
progressed. 

While Dave feels he is 
mOtivated by a love for the game, 
he recalls many "tedious times, 
involving long bus rides and 
endless hours in the hotel 
rooms." To add to the frustrati on. 
the Erie team did not get off to a 
good start in league play. At one

11 [0 the final four ," Dannevik 
said. "or we could get knocked 
out m the first round." In a year 
of inconSistency, it seems fi tting 
that [he real Tntons should please 
rise during the playoffs.

POInt, they lound themselves 12 
and a half games out of first 
place. But the team made a 
strong comeback, and played 
.700 ball during the second half 
of the season. They finished only 
one game out of the playoffs. 

While Dave enjoys seeing his 
team play well, he considers 
hImself more of an individual 
player now. "I want to improve 
my abilities firs[ : the success of 
the team is secondary The 
managers are there to develop the 
players." 

Almost all ballplayers dream of 
getti ng drafted. and being a left-
handed pi tcher hel ped Dave 
qUite a bit in that depanment. 
Lelt-handed pnchets are in 
demand. Dave feels he has as 
good a chance as any at maki ng 
the major leagues. though he 
realizes very few playe rs reach 
that level. Head baseball coach 
for the Tmons. Lyle Yates , 
desc ribed Dave as a "very 
intense, very competitive playe r. 
He took the field with the idea 
that he wanted to do mmate. He 
was hIS worst critic; he was 
harder on hi mself than anyone 
else was. He has tremendous 
pOte ntial and was the most 
talented pitcher to come through 
this program,"

Soccer team loses 
The men's soccer season came to an abrupt end 

Sunday when Washington University of St.louis-who 
had earlier defeated laSt year's champs, Wheaton-beat 
the Tritons in St. louis 3-1 in a double-ovenime 
shootout. 

Tied at zero after 90 minutes of regulation play, the 
Tritons battled Washington through two lO minute 
ovenimes before the game came down to a shootout. 
On five attempts, Washington scored three goals while 
the Tritons could only manage one. The loss ended the 
team's national championship hopes and left the 
Tritons at 21-2, their best record ever,

W1 RI; Tn WI R~~ Ski team ready for a white X-Illas 
Alumni Hoops: 

The UCSD men's basketball team whet it,s appetit~ for compemion by indulging in a smorgasbord of 
sloppy play with the Alumni All-Stars. beating the 01 timers 86-75 at Triton Pavillion before a crowd of 
200, half of whom played for the Alumni squad. 

T umovers. ",:ere popular from the onset. The AlumnI . having practiced only once, still looked a little 
rusty. commuting so~e bad passes and poor outside shooting. The Tritons. with only twO returning 
staners, played tentatively, but stili managed a 43-30 halftime lead on the outside bombs of Greg 
Kamansky and forward Brian Backens' IS first-half points. 

The tongue lash 109 that coach Barry Cunningham gave the Alumni produced a different team for the 
seco,nd half. Led by guards Randy Benn~tt and Brandon Nixon, the Alumni fastbreak reeled off a 20-7 
sconnfc spun, tying the game at SO-S?Tmon head coach Tom Marshall had his team employ a full -court 
press orcmg turnovers against the tlnng. graying Alumni. Mark SUleriin. a 6-foot-6 freshman ~rom Los 
Angeles, looked especially imp.ressive in the low post for UCSD; scoring 13 points. Il,in the second half. 

Marshall was not &?In~ to give any awards for his team's performance. "We looked okay, but we still 
have to gel as a team: said Marshall . The nucleus of this year's Triton squad revolves around Kamansky 
and Backens. who fmlshed up wuh 18 and 21 points, respectively. 

Say it ain't so dept. - Baseball's annual wInter meetings Will be held in sometimes sunny San Diego th is

however, the owners opened their books this year as pan of the strike scttlement and , as Ubereoth 
an nounced last week, 20 01 the 26 teams actl;lllUy lost money. Regardless of the basis of these n nancial 
woes - be they outrageous player salaries or mismanagement by the owners themselves - talk of 
expansIOn makes us gag. Certainly cities like Denver and Miami are large enought to deseve franchises, 
but conSiderIng the current state of some of the league's sicker franchises - San Francisco, Pittsburgh. 
Cleveland and Seattle - perhaps the league should consider getting their current house in order before 
they begm addmg on t<;' the present structure. Another argument against expansion is the thinness of 
talent. PerennIal losers like the Indians, Manners and Rangers in the American League belie the success

I T MAY SEEM difficult to get psyched up for the snow season. here in mostly sunny 
San Diego. but the 1986 UCSD 
snow ski racing team is ready to 
go, "We're going to be awesome 
this year!" states freshman ski 
team racer Gibbey Kluckohn. His 
thoughts are echoed 
enthUSiastically by fellow-racer 
freshman Rebecca Steinle: "We're 
totally psyched. We're going for 
the Nationals." 

LaSt year the women's skI 
racing team won the league title 

. and they went on to compete in 
Nationals. The men's team did 
not go to ationals. but managed 
to fi nish in thi rd place overall. 
Not bad fo r a snow skI team 
from San Diego. 

According to Senior Evon 
Speckhard, the 1986 Tri tons 
definitely have the potential to 
send not only the women's, but 
also the men's team to the 
Nationals. Pan of the Triton's 
secret [Q producing a competitive 
team is the dry-land workouts 
they are already engaged in. The 
dry-land work is something that 
few other schools employ as a 
pan of their training program. 

The team sets up training 
gates on Monday and 
Wednesday evenings OUI at 
Revelle field . It is here that they 
gain valuable knowledge of how 
the slalom courses are run dunng 
their eason Coaches Nick Nedd 

and Greg Barringer set up the 
gates on the slopes. 

But the gates are only a part of 
the dry land work preSCribed for 
the team. In addition to putting 
in twO nights a week in the 
weight room, the team tTies to go 
grass skiing as often as possible. 
Grass skiing is done in Presidio 
Park, where the Tritons are 
occasionally Joined by 
competitors from Cal State Long 
Beach. Grass skimg is thought to 
be harder tha n snow skiing by 
some TrilOn racers, and it helps 
them to further their strength 
and endurance in pre paration 
for the winter season ahead. 

Once there is adequate snow 
in the local mountains the ream 
will travel once or twice a week 
to Snow Valley to practice during 
night ski hours. Here is where 
the team finally gets to put in 
snow time, but since this does 
not happen as ofren as they 
would like the dry-land workouts 
prove to be invaluable. 

Both of the coaches for the ski 
racing ream once competed for 
the Tritons. Coach Nick Nedd 
was formerly a UCSD student 
and founded the team seven 
yearS' ago. He has since 
transferred 10 SDSU but manages 
to PUt in a considerable amount 
of time coaching the Tritons. 

Greg Barringer is a student at 
UCSD and was a member of the

When I returned to my office 
after the meeting , my secretary 
told me the radio was saying 
President Kennedy had been 
shot in Dallas. It was November 
22, 1963. The news of my 
resignation was lost deep in the 
back pages of that evening's 
papers." 

York's 25-year history with 
UCSD did not end there with 
his settling in as a professor. 
Since then, York has been the 
graduate dean during the McGiU 
Chancellorship, the fourth 
chancellor (on acting basis) of 
UCSD during the highpoint of 
activist years 1969-1971 , founder 
of the Program on Science,

and is presently the director of

"whenever there was a function

Was nothing for that person to do 
but to introduce himself or 
herself." 

Johnson retired from her 
working at the University House 
in 1983. The next year she 
travelled extensively through 
Europe, but returned to UCSD 
this year to work as a volunteer. 
"I have enjoyed many years at 
the university and am grateful to 
it. I like meeting people and I 
like what I'm doing now. I 
remember before, 1 used to think, 
'Why don't they pay men more 
so women don't have to work?' 
But now, I'm glad women have 
the choice to work and to do the 
things they enjoy." 

She hopes that by winter 
quaner, she'll still be teaching the 
an of American grocery shopping 
and cooking to foreign students 
as she has done for numerous 
years thro~h a program at the 
International Center. "What I do 
is I take these srudents to the 
store and they are amazed by 
what they see, because they 
haven't seen so much meat or so 
many types of vegetables. They 
ask me how you eat them, '00 
you need to cook them or do 
you eat them rawr and I ten 
them." She adds, "My apple pie 
recipe has travelled around the 
world both with me and through 
my students. What can be more 
American than apple pie?" 

Though nearly 80 years old, 
Johnson continues to be a patt 
of the university through her 
work and her memories. "I used 
to try to gd to every event

times I was the only black

bother me - It never did ."
