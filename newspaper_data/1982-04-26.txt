In 192:'), the ~()n of an 
aeronautIcs instructor. His 
formal education ended when 
he graduated from Phtlip~ 
Exeter high school at age 
even teen and immedlatel\ 

joined the' Army. Two year~ 
later, while sti ll in the Army, 
Vidal publi hed his first novel, 
entitled Williwaw. ince then, 
he has written ixteen other 
books, among them Burr, 
1876, Myra Breckinrzdge, and 
his latest, Creation. 

Vidal's politir~1 successes 
are questionable. Wit h Dr. 
Benjamin Spock in 196 he 
unsuccessfully campaigned 
for the Presidency as co·chair 
of the People's Part) agamst 
Richard M. Nixon. In 1960, he 
un s uccessfully ran for 
Congress in upstate New 
York . On the other hand, he is 
widely respected as a witty, 
uncomfortably intelligent 
political observer; sometimes 
vituperative, frequently 
egotistical, but alway s 
out poken and to the point. 
Vidal is currently running for 
the United tates enate as a 
democratic candidate for the 
California seat held by enator

Ground Zero only 
helping Soviets 
Editor: 

As much as members of 
"Ground Zero" and other such 
groups like to think of 
themselves as the only people 
against nuclear war, they are 
not. Even Walter Mondale 
thinks the nuclear freeze Idea 
is unworkable and believes 
t hal we must deal wit h the 

oviets from a position of 
strenb>th if arm~ control talks 
are to get anywhere. The 
disagreement l)Ctween' anti · 
nuclear war groups and the 
Reagan admintstration and its 
supporters i not with the 
question of whether a nuclear 
war would be horrible but 
with the question of what IS 
the best way to prevent a 
nuclear war. 

The first thing that we 
should consider when 
formulating a defense strategy 
is whom we are dealing with . 
George Kennan and other 
liberals believe that we should 
think of the oviets asju t like 
oursehes. This is a very naive 
and dangerous assumption to 
make. hould we consider 
ourselves to be just like the 
Japanese or Iranians imply 
becau e we are all human? In 
order to make a responsible 
decision, one must take into 
account all the facts - even 
the disconcerting ones. 

The founders of the Soviet 
Union were ~trong beltevers in 
Marxi t·Leninist Ideology -
an ideology which re<:juires a 
communist take·over of the 
world. In the oviet Union's 
sixty-five year history is has

other reason is hard to sa\'. 

I do not think the S<iviet 
leadership wants to accom· 
plish its goals by means of 
nuclear war. Their interna-

they want to destroy the West

Viewpoint 

The Peripheral Canal issue: 
water, sodium, and $3 billion 

By THOMA RANKIN 
I had the opportunity to be 

part of a wide-ranging study of 
the economics and ecology of 
the proposed Peripheral Canal 
back in 1974. It was a non-
partisan. academic study 
conclucted under t he directIOn 
of Jean lIelrich, an educator 
who then worked for the Ml. 
DIablo Unified. chool District. 
The same Peripheral Canal 
proposal is only now coming to 
the ballot (as a rider of 
Proposition 9), t he delay 
courtesy of the glacial progress 
of California politics . 

The most disturbing aspect 
of the se\'en'year hiatus 
between conception and 
conclusion IS the impact that it 
has had on public opinion. 
What was once a c1ear·cut 
issue has devolved into an 
incomprehensible melange of 
name·calling, chest·thumping 
and paranoia. The prevailing 
attItude of "north vs. south" 
has created an emotion· 
charged atmo phere, where 
facts fall by t he wayside. 

There are two major areas of 
concern in the Peripheral 
Canal is_ ue: its cost to the 
state (weighed against its 
benefits), and the danger it 

represents to the San Joaquin 
delta, California's last major 
source of fresh water. 
$1.3 billion gutter 

The proposed canal is over 
43 mile · long, its undertaking 
eclipSIng even that of the uez 
Canal. While the Suez 
represents a vital economic 
link of international propor-
tions. the Peripheral Canal is 

Letter to the Editor 

nothing more that a trench 
designed to suck fresh water 
from ri\'ers upstream of the 
delta for transport to 
agribusiness concerns in 
Central California. At most. 
less than 30 percent of the 
water from this project \\'('uld 
reach consumers here in the 
southland.

Some lie in die-ins, 
others play croquet 
Editor: 

When I grew up in a whIte 
middle class neighborhood, my 
friends and I enjoyed an 
occasional game of croquet. I 
never had a croquet set, so this 
privilege came only on the will 
of a luckier soul. I recall the 
safe. secure feeling of playing 
In a well-protected park, 
surrounded by nuclear 
families, hIgh income 
household - and suburban

children of my pa t, dressed in 
gleaming white outfits from 
the pages of The Creal Ca/sby, 
batted about brightly painted 
wooden balls wit h brightly 
painted wooden sticks. While 
an educational event which 
peaceably and effectively 
evoked the democratic process 
of this great nation took place, 
these Clorox-cleaned ana· 
chronists gleefully practiced 
croquet and applauded each 
others' keen play. 

Putting down 'Keeping It Up', 
easing Cosmo's peer pressure 

Those days are gone, but not 
missed. Carefree chi ldhood 
has been replaced by the 
concern of a growing young 
citizen. Now IIi\e with people 
who have an ethnicity and 
cu ltural background different 
from my own. My friends find 
themselved under economic 
pressure -- unemployed, 
sufferi ng with inadequate 
financial aid ordroppingout to 
earn money, hoping someday 
to afford a UCSD education. 
Nuclear confrontation and the 
threat of nuclear war plague 
newspaper headlines. Now I 
am forced to look beyond my 
own little world. 

Some Ground Zero Week 
participants were offended by 
this game which ha been 
handed down from the 
imperalist mood of a century 
ago. To some, this game 
symbol ize. the imperialist 
ideas of racism, sex ism and 
ageism, and white male 
supremacy. To others croquet 
IS the way that the lei. ure 
class power elite thumb a 
symbolic nose at those with 
Ie -s economic fortune. I 
remem be red the characters 
from Fitzgerald's Catsby, who 
live a devil -may·care life while 
the world falls down all 
around them. 

Editor: 
When we of the UCSD 

Women's Resource Center 
read Bruce Macdonald's 
"column," "Keeping It Up," 
we kept waitIng for the 
disclaimer, the statement to 
show that his remarks were 
really sarcastic. This cannot 
be for real. It never came. If 
this is how today's college 
student thinks, It is time for 
some education. 

Cl?smo and all the magazines 
lIke It create theirown market. 
People are not really like these 
plush figure images. The 
magazine tells reader'i what 
they are .supposed to wear, do 
and thInk. Most people 
succumb to thIS so called 
"p r pressure" rather than 

thinking freely. The media is 
oversaturated pith this type of 
Imagery. This pushes many 
women, and men apparently, 
to feel that thi!> type of 
behavior is their only option. If 
women adhere closely to this 
idea I. they WIll have 'iuccess in 
that all important game of 
finding a man. 

What you are going after i 
the image of a non -person 
which Cosmo wishes to create. 
When Cosmo says that women 
think X. what they are saying 
IS that Cosmo thinks that X 
will sell Y. If this is what you 
want, go for It. If, Instead. you 
want to thInk freely and find 
for yourself qualities which 
you deSIre to share in a 
partner, examine your own 
values 

A serious problem with this 
point of view 'n a "women's" 
magazine is that writers are 
reverting to old "male" 
strategies, i.e. to create an 
"ideal" stereotYI)C that no one 
quite lives up to. LIberatIOn of 
women does not mean to act as 
men have been socialized. 
Liberation of women includes 
freeing women and men from a 
ruthless socia lizal1on process 
which molds us into perverse 
behavioral tracts.

Keeping It Up_ 

A marriage proposal: try doing it more than once 
By BRUCE MACDONALD 

Marriage is too good to do 
only once. 

Let me put it another way: if 
you value the apparently 
degenerating institution of 
marriage as much as I do, 
you'lI get married as soon as 
you can. The younger the 
better. Why? It boils down to 
this: you want to till be young 
enough to enjoy it the second 
time around. It's the second 
marriage that, in the big 
scheme of things, ends up 
really counting. 

Hold your horses. If you 
think about what's being said, 
you'll under ·tand the nobility 
of my intentions. I am, and 
always have been, absolutely 
in favor of marriage. Some of 
mv \)Cst friends are married. 
But even more of them u'ere. So 
there must be a lesson in there 
somewhere. 

All I'm trying to do is to 
square my philosophy and 
sensItivIty wit h the inelucta-
ble reality of How It Really !s. 
Just remember this is probably 
even harder for me than it is 
for you - I'm more a "heart" 
than "head" person, which 
means I get depressed too often 
If my ideals and romantic 
sensibility arc dashed by the 
rigors and implacability of an 
obdurate world refusing to 
keep In step wit h the way I feel 
it ought to be. But I also have to 
be reality-oriented, too, even if 
you aren't, to come to terms 
with the way things arc. My 
proposal is unassailable if you 

conSIder the vulgar weight of 
brute fact. Logic and statistICS 
are on my side now. 

All I've had to do is add 
Intellection to intoxication, 
mix method with madness, 
blend sense with sincerity, to 
realize that one can still have 
one's biggest dream. 

And each of us has the same 
dream. Just give me one good , 
lifelong, compatible partner, 
and love will do the rest. 

But. hey. you're in 
California. Whether native or 
not, you're part and parcel of a 
hugely Indiosyncratlc 
mentality that the rest of the 
world drinks to, but then 
wakes up to with a hangover. 
Here, we get lost along the way 
despite the best of intentions. 

0, it's not just California, of 
coure -- the re ·t of the 
country isn't far behind -- but 
it\ probably worse here. You 
have to therefore own up to 
one thing: it's 50-50. Fiftv 
fifty! . 

According to each and every 
statistical compIlation, you 've 
got only half a chance of 
making your marnage work, 
regardless of good will. love, 
"preparatIOn." commItment. 
Face It everbody starts off with 
the same idea . They all fIgure 
the same thing. "We're 
different," each couple thinb. 
"We know each other so 
intimately," they say, 
anticipating the skeptics 
among their fl'lends and 
summoning up all their 
reserves of insight and mature 

l)Crcel?~lOn. "We know it 'l\ 
work. 

Famous last words. 
Too often intention has no 

cc)rrespondence with emerging 
reality .• 0 what's new? 

Just this: the next tIme 
around, according to the same 
statistIcians, they're going to 
make it work . They've got the 
obvious advantage of haVing 
been there. learned the basics 
and then some, tested patience 
and l)Crse\·erence. found out 
that "gro\\ Ing toget her" 
sometimes renders an 
incompatible hybnd. Those 
who started out wit h t he idea 
that "opposites attract" end 
up thinKing they need 
someone with more parallel 
Interests ; or people attracted 
to their onet ime soulmates end 
up wanting ~omeone dIfferent. 
You know t he story . 

But honest people admIt, 
"ooner or later, they'd do It 
again. Therein lies the whole 
point. 

The successful first 
marnage thus ends in dIvorce . 
In keeping wit h our policy. you 
learn I hal It's better to l)Cnd 
wllh Ihe blows than to fIght 
the punches. 

,(}Whal to do? Do what the\" 
dId. If you value marnage. 
divorce. And try to do It before 
It's tl)() far along. 

Onl~ once. though . Don't do 
a Liz Taylor or Mickey Rooney 
job on the whole idea and 
dance your way through seven 
marriages. I'm much more 

'ierious about the concept than 
that. 

So get on with It. Your 
romantic Ideab aren't 
IIlU'ilOnS, they Ju.,t need to be 
worked around and coaxed 
mto being. Keepmg m mmd 
that the first marnage serves 
the higher pu rpo-;e of 
functIOning as a tentatl\e 
probe into a complicated 
mechanism, you can see it as 
the matnx that finally Ix'gets 
the ultimate bond rhcH h()ld~ . 
t he one we were looking for the 

whole lime. 
It's heartening. Isn't It? 

You're really helping y,)urself 
to rour due port ion of

Just be sure you plan on it and

It starts with a vision. 
The work we do at the Fairchild Lab IS rather unique, Instead of 
starting with a problem to be solved, or an order to be filled , we 
start with a vision, 
Our mandate is to develop the technologies that will support 
computers and industry in the years to come. We live in tomorrows. 
The 256K dynamic RAM, digital Signal processors, GGDs, and 
telecommunications circu its are just some of the visions we're 
currently pursuing, There are others we can 't even discuss in print. 

We're looking for people with vision. 
While much of our work requires people with rich backgrounds in 
developmental technology, we also have some opportunities for 
talented graduates. 
We 'll be interviewing at UC San Diego to talk to people about to 
graduate with degrees in electronic /electrical engineering, solid 
state physics, chemistry, chemical engineering, or computer science. 
If you 're a student whose desire to learn and explore hasn't been 
dulled one iota by years of schooling, sign up now for an interview 
on-campus with the Lab at Fairchild.

however, that nuclear war, or 
even a conventional conflict 
with th Soviet Union is 
unavoidable, As Richard Pipes 
has JXlinted out , the Soviet 
leadership thinks morale to be 
extremely important in any 
military conflict. The 
notoriously inefficient 
economy of the Soviet Union 
cannot well stand the strain of 
an ever·increasing arms build· 
up without· ·causing severe 
morale problems . The 
reported strikes over the lack 
of food and other consumer 
goods in the USSR's Baltic 
states must be causing the 
Soviet leadership to reconsider 
taking an even greater JXlrtion 
of the GNP to produce the 
targeted 100 percent+ increase

strikes, and civil unrest in 
general would hardl y be 
condusive to a major thrust for 
world domination 'and could 

even threaten the power 
structure in the USSR, 

Whether or not President 
Reagan has yet convinced the 
Soviets that this unpleasant 
road- is the one they would 
have to take may become 
apparent when the START 
talks begin later this year. The 
anticipated costs of attemp-

throulth the acquisition of an 
intimidating nuclear advan-
tage, it is hoped, will convince 
the Soviets to use a different 
strategy or better yet, to 
compromise their Marxist -
Leninist doctrine (or their 
power craving) and to start 
acting like a nation instead of a 
cause, It is only under these 
circumstances that meaning·

Vasconcellos said yesterday 
he is still considering Basker·

Don Speech, a consultant on

as a lack of int erest.

One suggestion mentioned 
is tightening the conditions of 
the state' s appropr iat ion to the

ecurity, but not when some 

crook in the Department of 
Agriculture wants to cover hi 
tracks and puts "Top Secret" 
on a document, proving that he 
got off with two tons of 
potatoes. Which is what 
happen now. 

Have you got an environmen-

I certainly am for keeping 
the environment afe from 
James Watt. who is waiting for 
the Coming of the Lord. you 
know. Which may not happen. 
I'm oppo,ed to this kind of

There ' a lot of oil around 
WIt hout conveniently ripping 
up the coast line to get it. 

Whal about allerl/atitle 
energy sources? 

Well, there are all kind s of 
things around. I was talking to 
Barry Commoner (ecologi t. 
author, teacher) the other day, 
and he said thaL-with ju t the 
crops we grow now, if you take 
away the carbohydrate I think 

it is, and di till it into alcohol, 
it will take up one-third of the 
gasoline needs in America 
today .... He said the 
technology is there. Now this 
is Barry Commoner speaking, 
not me, but I'm ure that 
that's a possibility certain Iy.

Well , I'd like to see the Feds 
in on it , or at least not making 
it difficult. The problem is that 
the Congress by and large 
belongs to the oil companies, 
and the oil companie!» are not 
at a ll eager for any 
alternatives ju t yet; they 
want to make all they can out

Minor in African 
studies seents likely 

By LESLIE BOW 
A proposed African studIes 

minor to begin fall quarter will 
be up for review by the 
Committee on Educational 
Policy (CEP) in the coming 
weeks. The minor will be 
interdisciplinary, and will 
consist of course dealing with 
African studies within the 
history, literature, political 
science, sociology and visual 
arts departments. 

Bennetta Jules- Rosette, 
associate professor of 
sociology, explained that an 
individual ha not yet been 
chosen to head the minor 
program. 

"There are now seven 
Africanists on campus,"Jules-
Rosette said. "We have enough 
courses to mount a minor, 
which requires six or seven 
courses, and several students 
have expressed intere t in 
having a minor in African 
studies. What we have done in 
the past is ju t recommended 
people (on) an informal basis, 

but now there rea II v are 
enough courses and (t here i. ) 
sufficient interest to ha\'e a 
formal minor. " 

The proposed minor in 
African studies will consi t of 
six courses from two or more 
departments, and will be 
patterned after the Chinese 
studies minor. The courses 
range in scope from African

Jules-Rosette was confident 
that the minor proposal will be 
approved. "f can't see any 
reason why it wouldn't. There 
appears to be considerable 
student interest in the minor. 
The minor is not something 
that is going to cost anything 
- the courses are already 
here. It 's not like a program or 
anything; it reall y consoli -
dates existing resources that 
we haveon campUS,l>O I should 
think there would be support 
for it." 

WHAT'S THE 
DIFFERENCE? 
The difference: A Written 

Guarantee. We have student 
discounts, and evening hours, 

Just like many other shops. But, 
unlike others. we back up all our 

work in writing. If, after we've cut, 
permed, or colored your hair, you' re 
not completely happy, call us within 

seven days. We'll redo your hair at no 
extra charge. That's a big difference.

think the task of government 
would be to prod them along 
and get these things ready 
before we're desperate. 

This is a very research -
orienled university and a/ times 
I think the actual classroom 
teaching is underemphasized. 
Do you favor continued federal 
fu nding for research at 
uni versilies? 

Ye , but r would like to 
separate it from the Pentagon. 
I think the Pentagon is a great 
poisoner of wells, that the 
military machine doesn 't need 
any more money. and that it 
doesn't need any more 
sop hI s ti cated weapo nr y 
sy<;tems. at least in the 

forseeable future .... Whenever 
I set foot at MIT (Massachu-
sett. Institute of Technology), 
I feel like I'm on an Army 
base .... We must give money 
for peace-time purposes. You 
know, we must one day have 
peace. Our rulers don't like the 
notion, but there is a great 
peace movement in the 
world .... Let 's just keep the 
military out of it. 

What about social Security 
and Welfare. They are au I of 
hmrd; is there anythillg you 
propose 10 do? 

I wouldn't touch it myself, 
right now. [ don't think it 'd be 
wise. Cut the military budget 
first and get rid of the cancer. 

It 's a little bit like somebody 
coming to you with a tumor 
and conjunctivitis and saying, 
"I really want my eyes fixed 
first." I'd just say, "No, no, 
you're goi ng to have to have 
the tumor taken out first. " 
Well , that's the delen e budget 
t hat must be cut out. 

What about illegal immigra· 
tion? 

Well, the practical thing to 
do i to work out a deal, say 
with Mexico. We get Mexican 
oil at a decent price, and we 
allow them to work here 
legally. We get something, 
they get somet hing.

Neutrino measurement explored 
Two Los Alamos National 

Laboratory scienti ts think 
they've found a way to mea-
sure the sun 's flux of nutri -
nos for the pas t four million 
years. The experiment could 
have enormous consequences 
for particle and solar physics. 
including our concept of the 
sun and t he ongoing debate 
over a closed versus an open 
universe. 

George A. Cowan, recently 
appointed to the White House 
Science Council and a labora-
tory enior Fellow, and Wick 
C. Haxton, a]. Robert Oppen-
heimer Fellow at Los Alamo 
and a member of the Purdue 
University facuity. are propos· 
ing to measure solar neutrinos 
fluxes from molybdenum ore 
mined high in the Colorado 
Rockies. 

Neutrinos are important 
because these subatomic parti-
cles may be the best means to 
study the inner workings of 
the sun closely. Neutrinos are 
the only par tIcle generated 
deep withm the sun that sur-
vive the passage to the surface. 
and wing to earth in minutes. 
These elusive particles may 
also help sett le the debate over 
whet her our universe is gradu-
ally expanding or IS closed. If 
neutrinos have mass. thev can 
change in character dUring 
theIr trip to earth, and lower 
the expected flux. Such neutr i-
nos can account for the "miss-
ing" mass in t he universe, and 
lend credence to the idea that 
the universe is filled with 
these ghostly particles. Neutri-
nos could have sufficient col-
lective mass to reverse the 
outward expansion of the uni-
verse. so that some day. it will 
cru mple into a fireball, imilar 
to the "big bang" that many 
be lieve sta rted the whole 
thing. If. on the other hand , 
neutrinos have no mass, then 
the universe is unlikely to 
have sufficient mass to halt 
t he out ward tug of gravity. As 
the stars slowly burn out, 
space wi ll grow bleaker and 
emptier, in a never-ending out-
ward expansion.

"This may be one or" the 
most fascinating su bjects in 
science," Cowan comments, 
"bu t I do not pretend that we 
can p;.ovlde more than a few 
clues.

ton, a physici t. and a team of 
colleague~ will stud} hIgh ·

cally Int ract with some

sure the neutrinos reliably, 
scien tists will seek evidence of 
neutrinos in deep-buned dep-
ol>its of molybdenumorea mile

tain . With the cooperatIOn of

from molybdenum process 109 
and bring t hem back to the 
Laboratory. Here. with high 
technology equIpment t hat I"> 
able to Identify spenflc ISO-
topes selectively, researchers 
will look for three isotopes of 
technetium, including two 
that are the dIrect result of an 
interaction of neutrinos with 
molybdenum. The Isotopes, 
with "half lives" rangin\.{ from 
200,000 to 4 million \ ears.

trino abundance mer the mil-
lenia . (A half hfe IS the time

mt egrate to another nuclear 
form.) 

If the numbers of neutrinos 
reachtng earth, ashown by 
the molybdenum record, do 
not <,,'qual predIction' from the 
current model of the sun, Hax-
ton and Cowan say we will be 
forced to the realization that 
we do not know enough about 
the behavior of the sun over 
millions of year and must 
modify the standard solar 
model. or that our theories of 
neutrino behavior must be 
changed.

ahout 12 year. ago. To date, 
Brookhaven researchers have 
measured only about at hlrd f)f 
the neutrinos that would be 
expected, based on (Jut present 
mode'" of the sun. 

The Los Alamos researchers 
stress that the ongoing Brook-

8 The UCSD Guardian MOnday, April 26, 1982 

Work on geothermal energy source continues 
In two weeks, geoscientists 

at Los Alamos National Labor-
atory will attempt to establish 
the deepe t, hotte t reservoir 
in the world' fir t hot dry 
rock geothermal project. 

If the system operate as 
planned, it may eventually be 
used as t he energy u pply for a 

small commercial electrical 
power plant. 

Morton Smith. a staff 
member in the Earth and 
Space Sciences Division. says 
"The temperature of this rock 
is about 3000 degrees C (570 
degree F), however, the sys-
tem could be vaned, making it 

possible to recover useful heat 
in almost any location or geo-
logical environment with a 
resonably high geot hermal 
gradient." (Grad ient is the 
rate at which temperature 
increased with depth.) 

The operation will take 
place at the Laboratory's Fen-

Once the new reservoir is 
establi hed , it will be operated 
for a sufficient period to dem-
onstrate that it could be u ed 
as the energy supply for a com-
l11ercial power plant. An ear· 
lier experiment ha already 
produced 60 kWattg of electri-
cal power. Preliminary studie ' 
indicate t hat if geothermal gra-
dients are high and subsurface 
geology is favorable , cost of 
heat from hot dry rock should 
be comparable to that from 
coal. 

In the Los Alamos host dry 
rock program. two holes of 
unequal depth are drilled 
about 150 feet aparton thesur-
face; they are 1200 feet apart at 
the lower end. By pressure 
from water forced down one 
hole. the block of material be-
tween the two is fractured. 
The more fractures. the more 
hot dry rock surface available 
to heat water in troduced into 
the system. Thi heated water 
i circulated up the econd hole 
through a heat exchanger, and 

back down the first hole in a 
closed-loop system. 

It may be necessary to try 
several methods or a combina-
tion of methods before the 
group will be successful in 
fract uring the rock in the 
14,400-feet-deep hole. 

The preferred method IS to 
notch the " ides of t he hole near 
th lower end to establish a 
weak point and then apply up 
to 7,000 pounds per square 
inch of water pressure. If this 
method does not produce frac-
tures connecting the upper 
and lower hole s, larger 
notches will be created with 
high-temperat ure explosives 
and the process repeated . 

If the second method still 
does not produce the proper 
hydraulic fracturing, workers 
will resort to a ystem used by 
oil and gas drillers. A liner will 
be cemented into the hole. and 
perforateu explosively. Once 
thiS liner is in place and perfo-
rated. water under high pres-
sure will again be introduced. 
Supervisors are confident this 
will produce the desired frac-
tures and reservoir. Apnl29

The Peripheral Canal is one 
of the most financially 
ambiguou ,; projects ever set 
before California's 10.8 million 
\ oters. There is an ongoing 
debate over who will actually 
benefit from its passage, but 
one point remains clear; the 
government-estimated $1.3 
billion bill will be delivered to 
the state's taxpayers, nort h 
and south a li ke. Private 
analysts have pegged the 
actual cost closer to $3 billion.

but one of a m\'rIad of 
alternatIves available

Increa . lngly lImited fresh 
water resources. It' ... a lo..,er. 

Given that a minimum of 70 
percent of the yield from the 
canal will be earmarked for 
agriculture. it would seem that 
the indivdual consumer 
clearly loses out, but here we 
enter a large gray area. 
Agriculture i' one of 
California's mo ' t vital 
industries, and ignoring its 
needs out of hand wou Id have a 
devasta ting effect on our 
economy . The question 
remains . however, whether or 
not agriculture really needs 
such a large new source of 
water. 

As California's s hare of 
water from the Colorado River 
dwindles. the answer might 
seem an emphatic "yes." but 
this is not necessarih' t he case. 
The majority o'f water 
consumed by agricu 1 t u re is not 
used to wat er crops . Ins tead, It 
is u",ed to "flush" t he soil of 
excess salinit\ b tween 
plan lings. lronicall~. as Ihe 
Peripheral Canal draws fresh

It seems logical. then . that 
agribUSiness IS pushing 
fervently for approval of the 
Peripheral Canal initiati\'e. 
and in fact they would reap 
great financial benefit in the 
short-run. In the long run , 
however. t hey are endanger· 
ing the last easily accessible 
,",ource of truly salt-free water 
in the state . and further down 
the line , endangering the very 
industry they are striving so 
hard lO protect.

Brown's UC budget in Senate trouble 
SACRAMENTO - Gov. 

Brown's "investment in 
people" initiative for the 
University of California ran 
into trouble in a Senate panel 
recently. a budget·minded 
legi lators began grappling 
with a 1982·83 projected 
revenue shortfall of more than 
$1 billion. 

Brown 's propo al would 
grant the Univer ity $4 
million a part of a $17 million 
program to enhance under· 
graduate education and 
re earch in engineering and 
computer science. 

These fields have been one 
of the governor's pet projects. 
He often advocates beefing up 
high-technology education 0 
California can remain 
industrially competi tive. 

But two legislators on the 
three·member Senate Finance 
Education Subcommittee 
ex pre ed concern yesterday 
that the money cou Id be better 

pent in more ba ic education· 
alareas.giventhe.tate' fi cal 
condition. 

The State Finance Depart· 
ment released revised revenue 
projections for the next fiscal 

year la t week, predicting a 
$1.4 billion shortfall in 
Brown's proposed budget. 
That predict ion does not 
consider two tax·cutting 
mea ures on the June ballot, 
which could wipe out another 
$1 billion in revenue. 

"I want the governor to tell 
me why this (investment in 
people) program has priority 
over a school district going 
bankrupt." said subcommittee 
chair Walter Stiern, D· 
Bakersfield. "I have no 
objections to the program; I 
think it's a good idea . The 

quest ion is, where are our 
priorities?" 

Another subcommittee 
member, Senator Ken Maddy , 
R·Fresno, indicated he opposed 
spending additional money for 
research next year, but said he 

. "might be persuaded" to grant 
the funds. 

when there are problems in the 
present. I jus t don 't know how 
it will come out." 

Brown representative 
Robert Burkhart echoed his 
boss' se ntiment s about 
investing in t he future, sayi ng, 
"Our greatest hope is that we 
don't stand sti ll because of the 
economy. Given the budget 
crunch. this would be a good 
time to update our systems, 
which might be outdated. :t's 
crucial we get ourselves out of 
the situation we're in now. " 

Open tneeting act would 
not affect university 

University officials reported 
they would spend most of the 
additional money on new 
equipment for undergraduate 
technology labs. UC budget 
director Larry Hershman 
testified the Univer ity is as 
much as six years behind the 
state of the art in equipment in 
some departments. and would 
need $]5 million to catch up _ 

The Univer ity would al 0 
allocate $500,000 for 
recruitment in these fields. 
Maddy aid he opposed this 
expenditure because the 
University already has 2,000 
students waiting to enter 
these departments. 

Both the Senate and 
Assembly subcommittees 
deliberating on the UC budget 
have already approved $3 
million for Brown's proposed 
increase in graduate 
microelectronics and energy 
research. 

But that allocation, and all 
others in next year's budget.

UC lobbyist Lowell Paige

Regent will not be affected

approved in the Assembly 
Education Committee con· 
forming the board to tate 
requirements governing open 
l11eet i ngs. 

The bill would subject the 
regents to the Bagley-Keene 
Act, which requires state 
boards and commissions to 
conduct meetings open to the 
public. discussing issues only 
on agendas released lO days 
prior to the meetings. 

Closed meetings would only

decisions resulting from clo ed 
sessions would have to be 
publicized by the next 
meeting. 

"Heck, we release the 
results the next day ." Paige 
<;aid, adding the regents 
already abide by all the Bagley· 
Keene Act requirements. 

The bill's sponsor, Assem· 
blvmemher Gwen Moore (D· 
LOs Angeles) Insisted the bill is 
nere.sary. telling education 
committee members "the 
regents should conduct public 
business as you legislators

requires all new regents be

inform them of the conse-
quences of violating it. 

There was little debate of 
the measure in the committee. 
But Assemblymember Marian 
Bergeson, R- ewport Beach. 
suggested the legi lation 
ex t end to the Academ ic 

enate, which discusses 
course and admissions 
requirements. and decides on 
faculty tenure. 

Paige told committeemem-
hers while t he senate closes 
most of its Indl\;idual campus 
meetings to the public . 
meetings of the full senate are 
open. and all decisions are 
pu bl icized. 

The committee balked on 
Bergeson's suggest ion. 

He al 0 took issue with the 
high percentage of graduate 
engineering and computer 
science tudents who come 
from foreign countries. 

The ubcommittee post· 
poned voting on the allocation 
because its third member, Sen. 
Nick Petris, D·Oakland, was 
absent. Petris has usually 
supported such research 
expenditures_ 

UC Assistant Vice President 
William Baker said after the 
hearing that he was optimistic 
that subcommittee members 
could be persuaded to approve 
the monry, but added, "It is 
always difficult to convince 
anyone to invest in the fut urI.' 

Most of the UC's budget has 
already been discu sed. but 
there are two major areas still 
unre 'olved. The Assembly 
Ways and Means Education 

ubcommittee will debate 
student fee levels, and both the 
Senate and Assembly 
education sulx:ommittees will 
discuss capital outlay budgets.

Carlton. or George Benson. 
The diverse integration of 

mU"ical styles pyro Gyra has 
attempted to mold into a 
particular style of jazz while 
maintaining commercial 
viability is probably the 
greatest contributor to their 
const antly poor recept ion by 
seasoned jazz crit ics. Their 
blend of acow;t ic and electric 
instruments is musically 
related. although quite 
distantly, to the monumental 
Return to Forever group and 
McGlaughlin's Mahavishnu 
Orchestra, however Spyro 
Gyra's music is distinctly 
separate from fusion. being 
closer to mainstream jazz. 

Spyro Gyra. who will be at 
Mandeville Auditorium Friday 
for two shows, is one of the 
most misunderstood groups in 
the current jazz·rock scene. 
Maybe t his stems from the fact 
that Spyro Gyra is also the 
name of an algae that grows on 
!>tagnant water. But it's more 
plausible that the problem lies 
in the fact that their music is 
just plain hard to categorize. 
They 've been called every-
thing from "crossover." 
" MOR Jazz," "third gener-
ation jazz," to thing like 
"lightweight pablum." If one 
were to try to categorize pyro 
Gyra, they wou ld have to be a 
"New York based sout hern 
California style mellow latin· 
funk-pop-jazz·rock" type band

The breaks of the gatne ... 
Triton baseball team gets none as Point Lorna 
dominates league play, beats UCSD 7-5, 6-2 

By BILL FISH 
S!aff Write r 

Triton clean-up batter Brian 
Kummer almo t broke a car 
windshield hilt ing a foul ball. 
Wes Aozasa almost broke a 
few ribs trying to make a 
\'alia nt diving catch in 
centerfield. Dana Ostrum 
almo t broke up an important 
doubleplay on a slide late in the 
second game. The only actual 
break of the day, though, came 
when Dennis Co ·ta broke 
Mike Brown's aluminum oot 
on a shallow fly to rightfield. 

To win Saturday's double· 
header would have meant a 
Triton opport unity to fini h 
first place in the out hern 
Division. Point Loma College, 
however, proved to UC D 
(with a bit of assl!:.tance from 
UCSD) why they remain 
ahead in leaguc play, by 
beating the Tritons 7·5 and 6-
2. Pomt Loma got the breaks 
and took advantage of them 

Usually uperb Bob Allen, 
who hadn't pitched all week. 
\\ent the first game but 
couldn't hold an early 3-1 lead. 
"Bob just didn't have the 
fastball today," analyzed 
Coach Lyle Yates. 

The offense continued to 
battle for Allen throughout the 
affair but the defense

Three Point Lorna run were 
unearned, as CSD recorded

was replaced after being

Kei th Yokomoto relieved 
Reynolds, also contribut ing a

completely shut down the

Torrey Pines: A hacker tells his tale 
By JIM SCHUTZ 

Staff Writer 
Torrey Pines is a beautiful golf course, with 

rolling green hills and holes edging toward the cliffs 
above Black's Beach. It is a long course with little or 
no water and was de cribed by Jack Nicklaus as "one 
of the most beautiful public golf courses in 
America ." At least it was before we got there. 

A fellow hacker (who r wi ll ca ll.Toe to protect his 
pride and to protect him from the goundskeeper at 
the course) and I paid our hard earned money and 
walked to the fir ·t tee, North cour e. We were a 
twosome behind and in front of foursomes -
wait ing for our chance to play hide-and-seek with a 
little white bal l for four hours. 

Joe is one of t hose armchair athletes who pots 
your mistake before you swing. "I think you want to 
stay left, away from those trees. They could be 
trouble." Sure enough,l'd hi t it right in the middle of 

the grove on the right. Or he'd say, "Chip a little too 
far on this hold and it will run a country mile into 
that bunker over there." I'd chip, it would roll into 
the bunker and I'd cus . again . Just like p ycho· 
cybernetics, I'd hear it, see It in my mind, and watch 
it go right where he said . 

Joe is also one of tho e run-of-the-mill people who 
magically tran forms into Jack Benny on the golf 
cour e. "Hey, that might be a tough hot from 
there," he'd say after my ball rolled down the 500-
foot canyon onto the beach. ometime ' he'd just 
smile, knowing that if he muttered the slightest 
sound, or even coughed after one of my classic 15-
foot two-i ron shot , I'd pull my two-iron out and 
hook him into the rough. 

Joe IS no Arnold Palmer either, though . After each 
shot he 'd pull out a repertoire or obscenitie~ that 
would make Richard Pryor blush. His drives were 

too short, his putts too long, the sun was In hiS eye '. 
or someone had picked up his ball when really he had 
picked it up and put it m hIS back pocket. 

The four ome behind us must have worked for 
Chevrolet or a hot dog or apple pie company. The~ 
were as American as Bob Hope. All looked and 
played like Johnny Miller, with dark slack, cute 
pink and yellow sweaters, blond hair and that 
creased tan that golfers wear. They weren't loud, 
didn't tell you to watch for the break to the left 
before the cup, and they didn't giggle dUring your 
backswing 

There is no pomt to thIS story; no begin n II1g, no 
end. Just a middle. Golf is just a game and should be 
regarded in that manner. But don't tell that to me 
Don 't ask m~ \\ hy Joe and I go out and pa~ good 
money to hit a htt Ie white ball from tree to tree and 
come home mad as hell and take It out on the 
telephone recelwr. J u.,t don't ask me why

Excitable boys and girls turn Lumber Co. into sawdust 
By TYNA CALLAHAN 

Slaff Writer 
" But r hate sports!" I cried 

as the sports editor tore me 
away from my native 
territory, the Arts de 'k, and 
threw a rugby ball into my 
hands. [ was convinced . [ 
figured, do just this one sport, 
the poor guy' - desperate for a 
writer, then bail. 

"Co-ed soft ball," he said 
with a smile on hi face as [ 
tried to sneak in and slide m) 
last rugby art iele unobtru-
SIvely onto his desk. "Tim," [ 
said, .. it's one thing to cover a 
sport you know nothing about 
when it' somethinglikerugby 
- no one know anything 
about rugby . But softball? 
You're really going to 
embaras me." 

It didn't work, as you can 
see. I can't say no to a 
desperate sports editor who' s 
down on the floor grovelling 
and dripping unsightly tears 
on my espadrille _ 

As I dragged my elf 
unhappily away from the TG 
toward Muir Field, an intense 
fear of the unknown was 
welling up inside of me. When 
[ saw a crowd gat hering 
around a plot of grass in one 
corner of the field, I moved 
reluctantly toward it. I was 
trying to mu ter the courage to 
a k someone where [ could 
find the "Essie's Lumber Co--
Excitable Boys and Girls 
game." 

I knew that if I asked an 
unknowing stranger, I was 

going to get quite a strange 
look _ As I contemplated my 
dilemma, omeone came 
running up to me panting and 
yelling with a large degree of 
urgency, "Do you wanna play 
softball? We 're short a player." 
To which [ re -ponded in my 
mo, t official tone. ''I'm here to 
cover the game for the 
Guardian. " 

Well. I've never been so well-
received before in my life. Pre· 
game quotes, n;:lme '(and their 

r6$~tiyespellings), and even 
tip on what to write and how 
to write it. were flying at me 
right and left. Great , I thought, 
why don 't I just lea\'e my pad 
and pencil wit h t heseguys. tell 
them when the deadline IS to 
get the story inlo Monday'" 
edition, and I'll just go back to 
Ihe TG (author's note: the 
band was very good). I deCIded 
10 persevere. 

Get ting the strange rules of 
intramural co·ed so ftball 
straigh t was a test in itself. 
What little [ did know about 
softball was totally useless to 
me. 

The game consists of eit her 
six or seven innings, 
depending on how the time is 
running and on what the 
umpire has planned for the 
evening. It's a two·pitch game 
- the pitcher is a member of 
the team that he or she is 
pitching to, and each bat ter 
gets only two pitches, good or 
bad. They must get their hit 
from one of those. Another 

tp;ng which seemed strange to 
m was the plOch runner~. At 
Ii, point in the game there 
was even a pinch runner for 
Ihe pinch runner. 

El'sie's had the ear ly lead , 
W' v early. Things looked 
p, icularly great for them 
\\ 'n Ray Casey hit the first 
I leru n of the game with the 

I),,~es loaded . But , when Ray 
gt)t back to home ba"e. he was 
greeted with bad news - he 

. was out. He hadn ' t tagged 
third base. There was some 
consolation for him though . he 
drove in two other runs_ 

While trying nOI to let 
myself be too distracted by the 
guy juggling softball~ behind 
me, or by I he jokes fl ying all 
around me. the game slipped 
slowlv - perhaps quickly -
trom -Essie's Lum ber's hands. 

The EXCitable Hoys and 
Girls were sweeping them up. 
The Excitables pulled off two 
grand slam homeruns in the 
arne inning. Tom Chippen-

dale knocked the first of these 
nearly to home ba e of the 
diamond on which another 
game was being played 
diagonally across the field. 
Before the team got over their 
ec tatic wail, another pitch 
was driven beyond the reach of 
Essie' outfielder by Jeff 
Bracey. 

The toughest thing about 
my job t hat day was trying to 
find ou t the score (it was 
impossible to keep track of 

that motlc\' bunch). When 11 
ended. it w'a: obvious that the 
Excitable Boy and Girl~ had 
won , but for journali!>tic 
excellence, much more than 
that i" needed . 

I approached Henr y 
DeVri es. one of Essie's co-
captains who'd been keeping 

the stats, and asked him what 
the score was. All t hal he 
wou ld say \\'a~, "Many to 
little." I knew then that It 
must ha\'c been bad . It \'as.

Sockers -earn 4-3 
win in shootout 

By ANDREW KEELER 
The San Diego Sockers 

made their owner, Robert Bell . 
and the North American 
Soccer League very happy 
Saturday night. Not only did 
they notch an overtime victory 
over the Seattle Sounders. but 
for the first time this season it 
was a high-scoring affair. 

The NASL, which has been 
hurt by sagging attendance 
and defensive struggles, is 
looking to entice crowds with 
excitement - which in 
America means goals. Hockey 
was known for its low-scoring, 
dull games. but remedied that 
with the ri~ht hook. Since 
soccer doesn t offer too many 
brawls, the NASL employs the 
thrill·a·minute tie-breaking 
procedure known as the 
shootout, It was by this means 
that the Sockers edged out 
their northern opponents 4-3. 

Traditionalist gawk at this 
method, claiming that the 
NASL has bastardized the 
sport . The s hootout has 
everything an audience could 
ever ask for and more. The 
action is centered right in 
front of the goal so you can't 
mis it, there i a break after 
each shot, and the result are 
in tantaneous . 

Americans are notorious for 
demanding immediate gratlfi· 
cation and don't want to waste 
time not Ici ng good defense. 
obsen 109 well concei\'ed 
-.;t rat('~ or applauding lewei) 
crossing passes. Thi s IS 
c\'Ident in the success of the 
mdoor season. with Its double-
digit sconng and miniature 
field. Whether the shootout is 
a charade or not , one thing IS 
certain - il IS exciting. 

Tho!>e who stayed unt il the 
end were on their feet for each 
shot of the one-on·one format 
of the shootout. Others left 
when the ockers had a 3-2 
lead with under three minutes 
left in rpl!ulation time and 

looked as though they would 
carry it into the locker room. 
However, Seattle 's Mark 
Peterson sent the game into 
overtime when he beat 
goalkeeper Volkmar Gross 
with 2:13 to go. 

Things were looking good 
for San Diego. who dominated 
the game L when Vidal 
Fernandez scored his second 
goal of the game with ten 
minutes left giving them a two 
goal cushion. It appeared that 
Gross was on his way to his 
.fourth consecutive shutout 
after stopping Seattle in the 
first half and making some 
brilliant saves in the early 
going of the second. Ray 
Evans' goal dashed that idea 
and Steve Daley's penalty kick 
made the score too close. 

It was almost as if the 
Sockers wanted to go into 
overtime and pull out the big 
finish when the defense let 
Peterson sneak in for the tying 
score. After an event less 15 
minute sudden·death overtime 
period , it was shootout time. 

Gert Wieczorkowski and 
Ade Coker failed on their 
attempts, but Mike tojanovic 
and Paul Moyra tallied their 
tries for the ockers_ After 
Seattle had made two of their 
five shots it was left to Julie 
Veee 10 WIO the mat ch. He 
perfectly eXl'Cuted a fake on 
Sounder netminder Paul

Home games in gray 

It took a rainstorm to stop 
the Padres. After winning 10 
straight ballgame - to tie a 
club record - San Diego was 
washed out yesterday at 
Atlanta. 

The Padres return to an 
Diego for a Tue day night 
game with the New York Met s. 
The Mets, led by sluggers 
George Foster and Dave 
Kingman, are in second place 
in the National League East 
while the Padres are ]Ih games 
behind Atlanta in the West. 

Over the past week and a 
half the Padres have played 
well, been lucky, routed 
opponents, come from behind, 
had cheap hits, had home 
runs, and benefi tted from 
great relief pitching. 

runs and San Diego starters 
have been giving up too many 
gopher balls. Look for Foster 
and Kingman to pop a few out 
of the new, eco~om y·sized San 
Diego Stadium.

Oh, I think that \ .. ould be 
very nice. First of all, I thlllk 
all corporations shou ld pay 
tax, most of them evade 
taxation .... I thlllk it was in 
1975 that IT&T (International 
Telegraph and Telephone) 
paid no tax at all in the Un ited 

tates, absolutely none. 
I'd put a flat 10 to 15 percent 

ta.... on the gro s 3dju. ted 
Illcome of all corporat ion, , and 
leave no air III it 0 they 
couldn't monkey around. And 
~ince I hey don't like to be

them .... but t he\ are indeed 
non'profit and \"(·)It1ntar~. and 

have a specific end . On the

fou ndat ions, like t he Ford

sixty p<'rcent of the country

\ .... hat thi!-. whole thlllg i!-- about 
in one sentence. 

But there's not much you 
can do about it, they own 
Congress, they own the 
President, they own the media. 
I mean, look at Alexander-the· 
Great Haig, who wants a 
small, non -nuclear war, 
preferably 10 some place lIke EI 
. alvador. Nicaragua; what I 
call the Enemy·()f·lhe-Month 
Club. Caspar. Weinberger, of 
course. \\ ant!-t a nuclear 
confrontation quite clearly; he 
doesn't care where, some· 
\\ here in the Middle East, I

how Wicked they are. 
However, we tend to support 
only wicked governments, 
that ha been our policy for th 
last twoor three generations ... 
We likeevery country that has 

a c I dictatorship. Like Haig, 
explaining about six mont hs 
ago why we supported 
Argentina. ThiS was long 
before the Falkland Islands, 
and he Said, "Well, there may 
be a few things wrong With 
them, but we will support any 
nation that believes in one 
God." He wants to make the 
world safe for monotheism . 
Reagan now has foreign policy 
-- monotheism.
