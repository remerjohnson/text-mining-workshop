University of California under-
graduates will likely face another set 
of fee increases next year following 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Jan. 10 
announcement of his 2008-09 budget. 
Schwarzenegger’s budget proposal 
addressed the state’s projected $14.5-
billion deficit, calling for 10-percent 
cuts in funding to nearly all state-
funded departments and programs 
in order to combat the declared fiscal 
emergency.

Under Schwarzenegger’s proposal, 
the university would see a net state 
funding reduction of nearly $109 mil-
lion from the current year’s budget, 
resulting in a figure that falls $400 mil-
lion short of the amount requested by 
the UC Board of Regents in its 2008-
09 budget proposal. Of that shortfall,  
Schwarzenegger’s proposal calls for 
$70 million to be met by increases in 
mandatory student fees, including a 
7-percent increase in the Educational 
Fee and a 10-percent increase in the 

Registration Fee. An additional 10 
percent of the reduction is to be taken 
from administrative spending.

Schwarzenegger’s budget states 
that the remainder of the reduction 
would be unallocated, allowing the 
Regents flexibility in deciding where 
necessary cuts would be made, a 
suggestion designed to minimize 
the impact of the cutbacks on core 
instructional programs. 

In a Jan. 11 statement released 
by the UC Office of the President, 
spokesman Ricardo Vasquez indicat-
ed that, in addition to fee increases, 
the regents may address the cutbacks 
through limitations on future enroll-
ment and funding reductions to a 
number of existing research and stu-
dent service programs, among others. 

UC President Robert C. Dynes 
also commented on Schwarzenegger’s 
proposal in the statement, expressing  
concern at the prospect of drastic 
cutbacks. 

“This budget proposal will have 
serious impacts on our ability to deliv-
er on our mission for our students and 
for the people of California,” Dynes 
said. “State funding for the university 
is not an expenditure but an invest-
ment — an investment that produces 
real returns through an educated 
workforce, a dynamic economy, job 
creation and new tax revenue.” 

Additionally, Dynes said that 

attempts would be made to lessen the 
severity of the impending funding 
deficit. 

“We appreciate the magnitude of 
the state’s current budget problem, 
and we intend to examine this pro-
posal closely in consultation with the 
regents, beginning at their January 
meeting,” Dynes said. “And then we 
intend to work energetically with the 
governor and Legislature in the com-
ing months to minimize the impact, 
to the greatest extent possible, on the 
quality, affordability and public ben-
efit of the university’s programs.”

A Nicaraguan appellate court 
overturned a UCSD alumnus’ mur-
der conviction last month, ruling that 
the judge was biased and reasonable 
doubt existed in the case. Prosecutors, 
however, have appealed the case to 
Nicaragua’s Supreme Court, where 
the judges who exonerated him are 
under investigation.

Eric Volz, who graduated from 
Thurgood Marshall College in 2005, 
was released from a Nicaraguan 
prison on Dec. 21 when the appeals 
court overturned his conviction in 
a 2-1 decision. Volz was originally 
convicted of the November 2006 
rape and murder of his ex-girlfriend, 
25-year-old Doris Jimenez, in the 
dress shop she owned in San Juan 
del Sur, Nicaragua. He recieved a 
30-year prison sentence in February 
2007.

According to a statement released 
by his family, Volz, 28, is currently 
hiding in an undisclosed area due to 
massive opposition to the reversal of 
the verdict in Nicaragua.

“We have reason to believe he 
is being followed and [we] are tak-
ing every precaution to assure his 

safety,”  family members said in the 
statement.

Volz’s problems are compounded 
by the fact that, according to his 
mother and a family spokeswoman, 
he is ailing from kidney stones.

The brutality of the murder 
outraged many Nicaraguans, caus-
ing citizens and some politicians to 
staunchly oppose Volz’s release. A 
mob formed outside the courtroom 
chanting for his conviction the day 
that it was overturned.

Nicaraguan Attorney General 
Julio Centeno Gomez called the rul-
ing an “atrocity” and said that he 
would help prosecutors take the case 
to the Supreme Court.

In addition, the judge that was 
responsible for discharging Volz is 
accused of procrastinating casework 
to delay his release.

Nicaraguan law states that the lower 
court judge who sentenced Volz, Ivette 
Toruno, must acknowledge the appel-
late court’s decision with a signature 
before Volz can be released. However, 
Toruno did not show up at the court-
house on the day the papers arrived, 
claiming she had a flat tire. She later 
refused to sign the papers, alleging 
they were numbered incorrectly.

Volz’s attorney, Fabbrith Gomez, 
claimed that the judge purposefully 
postponed the release of his client, 
holding Volz in the country illegal-
ly. Gomez argued that Toruno was 
delaying the process in order to allow 
more time for an appeal to be filed 
with the Supreme Court.

Those few days were especially 

worrisome for Volz’s family, spokes-
woman Melissa Campbell told the 
Washington Post, especially because 
Nicaraguan radio shows had started 
calling on citizens to “take justice into 
their own hands,” she said.

“Every min-
ute that Eric 
stays in jail is 
such a concern 
for us,” Volz’s 
mother Maggie 
Anthony told 
the Associated 
Press. “We’re 
more fearful 
for his life right 
now than we 
ever have been. 
We’re so frightened for him.”

Although the murder conviction 
was overturned on Dec. 17, Volz was 
not freed from jail until his papers 
were finally signed on Dec. 20.

Volz had his passport returned on 
Dec. 21 and left Nicaragua the same 
day at 2:45 p.m. local time, according 
to U.S. State Department spokesman 
Curtis Cooper.

“We are pleased that the 
Nicaraguan Appeals Court decision 
... has been implemented in accor-
dance with Nicaraguan law,” Cooper 
told the Associated Press.

Cooper told CNN that the State 
Department had been persistent-
ly working on Volz’s case, sending 
the U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua 
to speak to multiple government

Biological Sciences Senator Emma Sandoe campaigns during last year’s elections, which 
are now implementing instant runoff voting that ranks candidates in order of preference.

By Jesse Alm
Associate News Editor

At its final meeting of Fall Quarter, 
the A.S. Council unanimously passed 
a resolution to implement instant 
runoff voting in its elections, fulfill-
ing a torrent of pleas from students 
and campus organizations that began 
in 2003.

Biological Sciences Senator and 
council Speaker Emma Sandoe said 
the group has overwhelmingly sup-
ported the voting system for years — 
in fact, the council passed a resolution 
to adopt IRV in 2003 — but the logis-
tics of implementing it on TritonLink, 
where all voting takes place, have been 
out of the council’s control.

“We’ve just been waiting for 
TritonLink’s approval,” she said.  

The approval finally came last 
month, when TritonLink officials 
said that they were capable of main-
taining the system. The council wast-
ed no time, enacting the initiative 
less than a week later on Dec. 5.

The IRV system allows voters to 
rank candidates in order of pref-
erence, ensuring that the winning 
candidate has the broadest support. 
If no candidate receives a majority 
after voters’ first choices have been 
tallied, the candidate with the fewest 
number of first-place votes is elimi-
nated, and votes are retabulated until 
at least 50 percent of votes go to one 
candidate.

Currently, the system only applies 
to A.S. officers and academic divi-
sion senators. Sandoe said that the 
council’s decision is a step in the 
right direction.

“[The system] gives people more 
of a choice, and the whole campus 
will probably move over eventually,” 
she said.

Earl Warren College alumnus 
Daniel Watts, who served as vice 

chairman of the Voting Systems Task 
Force that researched IRV in 2003, 
submitted a letter to councilmem-
bers last month urging them to finish 
what he said was a major battle in his 
UCSD career.

“For years, only TritonLink’s 
bureaucracy stood in the way of a 
more progressive and fair voting sys-
tem for UCSD,” he said. “And now 
they’ve finally responded. Please, 
please support generations of your 
predecessors, and approve IRV.”

Opponents of IRV have histori-
cally claimed that the system’s more 
complex methodology will con-
fuse voters, thus reducing turnout. 
However, Sandoe pointed out that 
voters will be able to rank as many 
or as few candidates as they wish, 
and she said that if anything, the new 
system would encourage increased 
participation.

“Most other major universities 
have the same system, and they 
have higher voter turnout,” she said. 
“People are going to vote no matter 
what, and the new system won’t slow 
them down.”

IRV received national attention in 
the 2000 presidential election, when 
many voters decried the current plu-
rality system, alleging that votes for 
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader 
contributed to former Vice President 
Al Gore’s loss of electoral votes in 
Florida. 

In a December e-mail to the A.S. 
Council, former A.S. President Harry 
Khanna cited the Nader example 
as well as the Green Party’s result-
ing campaign to implement IRV in 
national elections. 

He emphasized that IRV will 
address the old campus voting sys-
tem that he considered to be “inher-
ently undemocratic.”

“The current system encourages 
two major ‘slates’ and makes it virtu-
ally impossible for independent can-
didates to win,” he said. “IRV ensures 
proportional representation so that 
one slate can never dominate the 
entire council.”

Scientists Find Potential 
Cure for Liver Disease
Campus researchers have found 

a possible cure for cirrhosis of the 
liver by successfully reversing the 
excessive tissue scarring that causes 
the damage. 

Experiments conducted on 
mice at UCSD have shown that 
scar tissue in the liver can return 
to its normal healthy state. This 
breakthrough could lead to the first 
curative treatment for cirrhosis and 
other similar conditions caused by 
illness or injury. 

Livers affected by cirrhosis have 
their healthy tissue gradually broken 
down into fibrous scar tissue. As a 
result, liver function begins to fail. 
The condition is most commonly 
caused by alcoholism and hepatitis 
C. Approximately 800,000 people die 
from cirrhosis each year worldwide. 

UCSD Receives $1-Million  
Lifelong Learning Grant
The Bernard Osher Foundation 

has awarded the university $1 million 
to support lifelong learning for older 
adults. The endowment will expand 
outreach and strengthen lecture 
programs at UCSD Extension’s 
Osher Lifelong Learning Institute. The 
adult education program consists of 
curricula designed for those who are 
at least 50 years of age and want to 
study in a university setting.

“This gift demonstrates the 
foundation’s appreciation for the great 
strides we have made in developing a 
wide array of intellectually stimulating 
learning opportunities for older 
learners,” Mary Walshok, associate 
vice chancellor for public programs 

and UCSD Extension dean, said in a 
press release. 

Trigger for Cancer-Fighting 
Marine Product Uncovered

A discovery made in marine 
biomedical laboratories at UCSD’s 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
has led to key information about the 
fundamental biological processes 
that occur inside a marine organism, 
leading to the creation of a natural 
product currently being tested to 
treat cancer.

The finding could pave the way 
for new applications of the natural 
product in treating human diseases. 

The research team, led by Bradley 
Moore, a professor at Scripps 
Oceanography Center for Marine 
Biotechnology and Biomedicine 
and Skaggs School of Pharmacy 
and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and 
postdoctoral researcher Alessandra 
Eustáquio, uncovered an enzyme 
called SalL inside Salinispora 
tropica, a promising marine 
bacterium identified by Scripps 
researchers in 1991. 

Researchers also discovered 
a novel pathway for the way the 
marine bacterium incorporates 
chlorine atoms, the key ingredient for 
triggering its potent cancer-fighting 
natural product. The Salinispora 
derivative is currently in phase 
one of human clinical trials for the 
treatment of multiple myeloma and 
other cancers. 

“This was a totally unexpected 
pathway,” Moore said in a press 
release. “There are well over 2,000 
chlorinated natural products, and 
this is the first example in which 
chlorine is assimilated by this kind 
of pathway.”

proposal in a teleconference last 
week, articulating her disappoint-
ment at the prospect of further stu-
dent fee increases.

“When fees rise, qualified and 
hard-working students are blocked 
from attending the University of 
California,” Hendrickson said. 
“Already fees have risen faster than 
the average income of hard working 
Californians.”

Hendrickson said that her own 
financial woes illustrate the prob-
lems faced by many UC students 
today.

“I’ve already had to torch one quar-
ter of classes on a credit card because 
of last year’s fee increases and I’m 
over $130,000 in debt,” Hendrickson 
said. “I chose to attend a UC because 
of its excellence in education but also 
because it was a state school and I 
could afford it. This is quickly no lon-
ger being the case.”

Schwarzenegger’s budget will be 
reviewed by the state Legislature in 
the coming months, during which 
time legislators will suggest changes 
to the proposal until a final decision 
is reached. 

The regents are not expected to 
take any action regarding budget 
decisions or set student fee increases 
until later this year.

officials, including President Daniel 
Ortega, to push the case forward.

The defense used Volz’s personal 
cell phone records to show that he had 
used the phone in Managua, more 
than two hours away from the murder 
scene, at the time Jimenez was killed.

Although Volz has fled the country, 
the Supreme Court is currently investi-
gating the decision 
of the three-judge 
panel. The two 
judges who ruled to 
overturn the con-
viction, Roberto 
Rodriguez and 
Alejandro Estrada, 
appeared before 
the Supreme Court 
last week to explain 
their ruling.

R o d r i g u e z 
defended his posi-
tion as legally and 
morally correct, but 
has continued to receive threatening 
phone calls and accusations of bribery.

“I have been in a state of terror,” 
Rodriguez, who has U.S. citizenship 
and has lived in the U.S. for 18 years, 
told the Nicaraguan newspaper the 
Nica Times. “I can’t say that I am brave 
and that I don’t care what’s going to 
happen. Of course I’m afraid.”

The investigation, which could take 
months, has postponed Rodriguez’s 
original plans to retire.

Volz’s murder conviction was 
primarily based on the testimony of 

Nelson Danglas, who was originally 
arrested for the murder. He was given 
full immunity in exchange for testify-
ing against Volz.

Volz was sentenced despite the fact 
that no physical evidence was found at 
the crime scene that could link him to 
the murder and that 10 witnesses had 
testified that Volz was in his office in 
Managua.

Following the 
conviction, Volz’s 
family spearhead-
ed an enormous 
media campaign 
to overturn the 
ruling, creating 
a Web site and 
a MySpace page 
to collect dona-
tions and pro-
mote awareness 
of the case to the 
American public.

“We have 
experienced the 

most abundant love from friends 
and total strangers, and we thank 
you,” a statement from the family 
read.

A major in Latin American stud-
ies at UCSD, Volz has traveled exten-
sively throughout Latin America. 
During his tenure in Nicaragua, 
Volz started the eco-conservative 
magazine El Puente and worked as a 
real estate broker.

OPINION

By Marissa Blunschi
Associate Opinion Editor

After three years of financial neglect 
from the state, student academic prepara-
tion and outreach programs are receiving 
some desperately sought-after attention in 
the 2008-09 California state budget. 

This year, the Legislature rejected Gov. 

By Natasha Naraghi
Senior Staff Writer

According to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s proposed 2008-09 state budget, the University of 
California would lose approximately $332 million in state funding as soon as July of this year. The 
governor hopes that the severe reduction will put a dent in the projected $14.5-billion state 
deficit. 

But even by footing the bill for the state’s ballooning debt, UC students would still 
see dwindling services in the upcoming school year, with fewer class offerings, program 
eliminations and weakened academic resources and support. Basically, they would pay 
more and get less — and it’s not UC students alone. 

California community colleges and the California State University system would also 
meet massive financial slashes in the upcoming school year, losing $484 million and $312.9 
million respectively. California community colleges would also face a $40 million midyear 
cut if legislators implement the new budget. But the K-12 schools would fare the worst, with 
an astounding $4.4 billion in funding cuts in 2008-09 and a midyear loss of $360 million.

It simply isn’t fair that students should be forced to sit by and watch as their fees climb and 
their services shrink. By endorsing the proposal, Schwarzenegger would be turning his 
back on the thousands of talented young people desperately seeking a college education. 

State lawmakers should think long and hard before they approve the governor’s bud-
get proposal, exploring every possible avenue to lighten the burden that will otherwise 
fall on California’s students. 

The governor may think that by pushing a stranglehold on state spending he’s 
delivering on his no-tax-increase promise to California citizens, but in reality he’s 
failed miserably. All he’s really done is insidiously dump it in the hands of overbur-
dened students so that he can turn a blind eye and come out looking like the good 
guy to the taxpayers. And for that, he should be ashamed.

You can tell a lot about peo-ple from their grocery-store conduct. There are those who 
make neatly itemized lists, those who 
rely on a messy assemblage of mental 
notes and those, like my grandmother, 
who casually stroll down every aisle, 
reading packaging details and brain-
storming possible meals. But for me, 
it’s all about precision.

I enter Vons briskly, march direct-
ly to the aisle of whatever amenity 
I’m buying — shampoo, a pint of ice 
cream, printer paper — then slide into 
the express checkout line. And as the 
checker hands me back the newly plas-
tic-shrouded item I say thank you, 
smile politely and pull said item from 
the bag. After all, I can carry a bottle of 
shampoo in one hand just as easily as 
I could a bag; there’s no need to create 
more waste.

Each year shoppers worldwide go 
through, literally, trillions of plastic 
bags. And where do these bags end up? 
Some will be shoved precariously into 
kitchen cabinets or used to line trash 
bins. But most of those thin plastic 
soldiers will spend the decades after 
their trip home from Vons in landfills, 
blown about in the wind or float-
ing around the ocean to be ingested 
unhealthily by sea creatures.

This reality is getting harder and 
harder to ignore and San Diego’s 
northern neighbors are finally tak-
ing action to curb needless pollution. 
San Francisco has outlawed plastic 
bags completely, and the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors is now 
considering a fee system. Some stores, 
such as Swedish furniture-mecca 
IKEA, have already implemented a 
plastic-bag fee. And while La Jolla 
stores hand out plastic bags like stu-
dent organizations do Welcome Week 
flyers, it’s nice to see that some people 
have gotten the hint.

Unfortunately, something free usu-
ally equates to something disposable. 
If shoppers don’t have to pay for bags, 
they won’t associate any value with 
them and aren’t likely to consider where 
the bags end up. But when confronted 
with even a minimal fee, shoppers are 
forced to assess their need for the bags, 
usually deciding they’d rather deal with 
the slight inconvenience and save both 
their pennies and the environment. 
Plus, being green is totally in this sea-
son — reusable grocery totes are gain-
ing popularity, and rightfully so.

For this reason, we should consider 
applying minimal fees not only to plas-
tic bags but other items as well. What 
about paper fast-food napkins? How 
many times have you grabbed a pile, 
dirtied one or two, then thrown them 
all out at the end of your meal? 

Imagine if restaurants gave out two 
napkins per order and charged a nickel 
for each additional one. While this isn’t 
too much to bring bankruptcy upon 
messy eaters, it is enough to get people 
thinking.

Accompanying these fees can be 
recycle systems, so that people who 
need the plastic bags for the trip 
home can use them, then be reim-

Stealing
the Shoes

Long ago, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger promised a 
new day of politics and new attitude of political spending. 
But it now seems that day is a ways off, with California 
now standing at the precipice of a gaping fiscal abyss that 
is $14 billion wide. And just as much as legislators are 
readjusting their game plans — cutting down programs, 
reducing expenditures and utilizing other belt-tightening 
procedures — collegiate student advocacy groups should 
expect to do the same.

Calling your local legislator, the foremost “you-can-
make-a-change!” approach used by such groups, will 
likely fall flat in these trying times.

Why? Legislators will have a handful of quick and 
justifiably correct answers: We have to pay for state health 
care. We have to pay for criminal justice programs. We 
have to pay for K-12 schools — all while dodging the 
much-hated tax hike. Simply put, priorities are now more 
important than ever. State funding to our universities, a 
mostly financially autonomous 10-campus system, will 
undoubtedly hover around the bare minimum.

But to see the university shortchanged is still a 
tragedy. Long-term fights to see certain university 

programs revived and student services expanded will 
most certainly fall to the wayside, while state scholar-
ships such as the Cal Grant can say goodbye to any 
growth and possibly even see a reduction. Together, 
the budget shrinkages make it that much more difficult 
for the underprivileged to attain a UC education. But 
with lawmakers in Sacramento yelling “code red,” there 
seems to be little flexibility to deal with priorities in 
higher education: lower fees, better programs, smaller 
class sizes and more outreach.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has passed the decision 
of where these cuts hit into the regents’ hands. It will be 
months before the dust settles, and we see which pro-
grams and services take the worst cuts.

The upcoming Feb. 5 vote will prove vital to both 
the financial health of the state and university. Passage 
of the measure to give the state’s community colleges 
a fiscal boon, for example, will give the state’s legisla-
tors less to spend on the UC system. So with a smaller 
money pot than ever in California this year, student 
advocates should hold fast to the “give a little to get a 
little” understanding.

A hulking deficit has swallowed state resources, leaving many scrambling for new spending priorities. 
The Guardian’s staff members write their own list of university-related priorities in a financially grim year.

Reality Check: Everybody Hurts in State’s Fiscal Picture

QUICK TAKES

Employees Could Find 
Less Financial Support

By Serena Renner
Senior Staff Writer

When the going gets tough for the state of California, 
UC students wish they could get going. 

Historically, amid deficit, the state government 
places additional costs of higher education on stu-
dents’ backs, and after a decade of steep increases, 
the trend will likely continue as students are expected 
to face yet another hit in 2008-09. According to Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s state budget proposal, stu-
dents would see a 7.4-percent increase in mandatory 
fees, intensifying the longstanding problem of college 
affordability and leaving room for the UC Board of 
Regents to tack on extra dollars, which does nothing 
to calm student fears.

The increase translates to a system wide fee of $490 
for resident undergraduates and $546 for resident 
graduate students, amounting to $7,126 in annual 
tuition for in-state undergraduates. As if that’s not 
troublesome enough for the countless struggling col-
lege students and their families, the proposal also 
permits the regents to increase fees beyond the rec-
ommended levels to compensate for the extent of 
UC budget cuts. Considering that UC’s state funding 
would fall $400 million below the amount requested 
by the regents under the proposal, it’s pretty easy to 
predict what they will do.

Granted, the state and UC system must endure 
severe cuts across the board to address the state’s 
estimated $14.5-billion debt and the recommended 
7-percent increase is consistent with the previous year; 
however, the state too often expects costs to be back-
filled by student fee increases, forcing students to help 
bail the state out of a debt they did not create.

While students and their families are becoming 
desensitized to the rising numbers on their college 
tuition statements, the cost of a UC education has 
more than doubled in less than a decade. While 
California claims to be investing in its future by 
producing an educated workforce and dynamic 
economy, public education is becoming a privi-
lege for the wealthy rather than an equalizer to 
close the gap between rich and poor. While 
more people may be attending college, stu-
dents are faced with increased amounts 
of debt, making the goal of a “dynamic 
economy” an unrealistic ideal until the 
state government stops punishing 
students for its poor planning 
and starts prioritizing access 
to public education.

Arnold Schwarzenneger’s proposal to 
— yet again — reduce General Fund 
support for University of California 
student academic programs by $19.3 
million. The state will now fund these 
programs, which have become an 
integral part of increasing diversity 
and assisting students from disadvan-
taged schools, with $31.3 million for 
UC schools. 

According to the University of 
California Office of the President, par-
ticipants in UC academic preparation 
programs now account for 30 percent 
of black UC freshmen and 33 percent 

ules and staggering wage disparities 
that would mean less compensation 
for the longest standing veterans than 
for fresh college grads. CNA and the 
university have moved on to the fact-
finding step in their mediation process, 
but the facts have already been found 
and they speak for themselves.

AFSCME representatives fail to 
understand why recruitment and 
retention of patient-care technical 
employees aren’t higher university pri-
orities, considering new technicians 
and nurse’s assistants have no choice 
but to turn to co-workers for on-the-

Columnist Confuses 
Political Cause and Effect

Dear Editor,
Jake Blanc stated in his column 

that “in order to have any hope of 
political success, a candidate must 
abandon the majority of his or her 
core beliefs.” He cited politicians 
such as Dennis Kucinich, Cynthia 
McKinney and Leonard Peltier as 
those who haven’t, and are thus rel-
egated to the fringes of politics.

I respectfully disagree. First, mod-
eration is not ipso facto a sign of 
political prostitution. Simply because 
a Democratic candidate does not 
swing as far left as Blanc would like 
is not proof that their policies are in 
some way less “genuine.”

On the second point, I believe that 
Blanc has misunderstood cause and 
effect. While he claims that Kucinich, 
McKinney and Peltier have no chance 
of national political success because 
they cleave to their core beliefs and 
do not “meander along party lines,” I 
would instead argue that they have no 

chance because their core beliefs are 
absolutely insane. Thank goodness 
the American body politic, for all its 
faults, leaves no place at the national 
level for extreme nanny-state paci-
fists (Kucinich), race-baiting 9/11 
conspiracy theorists (McKinney) and 
convicted cop killers (Peltier).

point isn’t to hassle people just trying 
to go to the market — it’s to discour-
age people from so easily creating 
excess waste.

If people have to pay for plastic 
bags, not only will they use them more 
sparingly, they’ll also be more likely to 
reuse or recycle them. And for those 
wasteful shoppers who will continue 
to squander bags regardless of price, at 
least now they will begin to be mon-
etarily responsible for their actions.

Few are so cynical as to accuse 
the university of deliberately imperil-

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

As streaks of battling supersoldiers cover Price Center Ballroom’s white walls and rows of glow-
ing television sets display dueling 
Nintendo characters, it’s surprising to 
see that despite the room’s action, it’s 
the concentrated minds and strained 
thumbs of hundreds of still-sitting 
gamers that are fueling most of the 
excitement. But at Sixth College’s 
fourth annual Winter Game Fest, 
mind-thumb coordination is the only 
skill needed.

Founded and organized by the 
Sixth College Technology Committee 
in 2005, the first and second Winter 
Game Fests were exclusive to Sixth 
College students, attracting approxi-
mately 12 and 100 attendees, respec-
tively. Since then, the event has been 
opened to the entire campus as well 
as non-students, increasing atten-
dance to 1,125 at this year’s Jan. 12-13 
competition. The continual growth 
of gaming events like Winter Game 
Fest or Warren College’s annual 
Video Game Extravaganza represents 
UCSD’s budding culture of gamers 
— one that Amrit Sareen, the Sixth 
College Technology Committee com-
missioner, hopes to expand.

“Next year I have a plan to expand 
this across universities, so it will be 
UCSD, UCI, UC Riverside and we 
might even talk to SDSU to make this 
a cross-campus event,” Sareen said. 
“I’d like to see this expand even more. 
I want to see this as big as Sun God or 
some of the big events [UCSD] has.”

According to Sareen, who was 
responsible for organizing the 

event and finding its spon-
sors, high school and 

college students make 
up about 90 percent 

of the gaming demo-
graphic, but 

the industry is continually growing.
“Last year was gaming’s biggest 

year, because Halo 3 sold a record 
number of copies and there were just 
a lot of games that sold a lot,” Sareen 
said. “Gaming companies are grow-
ing every year, and you see more and 
more consoles where games are being 
played on. And now with the Wii, 
that’s a whole new physicality onto 
games. As games evolve and grow, 
I think their scope will grow as well 
and more, and more types of kids and 
adults will become gaming fans.”

As a way to offer prizes and fund 
other expenses for the event, Sareen 
secured sponsorships from BAWLS 
energy drink, E-Sports, EA games, 
Ideazon, Microsoft and the Office 
Games. The donated merchan-
dise included over $5,000 worth of 
software from Microsoft and 2,000 
BAWLS energy drinks. According to 
BAWLS marketing and media contact 
Sabrina Gonzolas, the rising popular-
ity of gaming has gained the atten-
tion of many companies looking to 
enhance or accessorize the gaming 
experience.

“[Gaming is] a multi billion-dollar 
industry,” Gonzolas said in an e-mail. 
“They are fighting for logo exposures 
in games, sponsoring pro players and 
nearly every video gaming center in 
the country now has an energy drink 
cooler stocked with caffeine to keep 
gamers alert while playing.”

In addition to marketing 
and advertising their products, 
companies like Microsoft felt 
its presence at the event was 
important for recruitment 
reasons.

“Gaming is not 
just entertainment 
anymore,” said 
A n u b h a v 

Chopra, a Thurgood Marshall 
College sophomore and UCSD 
Microsoft Student Representative. 
“Careers in the gaming industry that 
relate to the study of technology, engi-
neering, math and the arts is on the 
rise … Our hope is that students will 
be willing to explore [these] fields 
of study because of their interest in 
gaming.”

As sponsors looked to make a 
connection with participants by sta-
tioning merchandise tables and soft-
ware previews at the Winter Game 
Fest, attendees wandered through the 
many console and computer stations, 
choosing from popular console, PC, 
and video games like Halo 3, Counter 
Strike and Super Smash Brothers. 
Despite the fact that each Winter 
Fest competition ends within an hour 
or so, dedicated gamers allot a huge 
amount of time to improving their 
skills and mastering the game.

“I play … about two to three hours 
everyday,” Sixth College freshman 
Albert Orona said. “Most of the time 
it’s social. We get everyone in our 
suite together and have fun. I’ve gone 
whole weekends and breaks playing 
video games. This past break I got 
sick for four days and I just played for 

those entire days. I would eat 
and take breaks for two-

hour naps because I 
wasn’t feeling that 
good, but other 

than that I would 
just play video 
games.”

Like Orona, 
many other 
students find 
t h e m s e l v e s 

distracted 
or con-

sumed by 
g a m i n g . 
Although the 
time dedi-
cated to game 
play varies for 
each person, 
many seasoned 
gamers agree 
that gaming has addictive qualities 
through features like level advance-
ment and character development. 
Sareen, who plays games himself, said 
games are designed to keep people 
playing and can sometimes be detri-
mental to students’ academic lives.

“I don’t get bad grades, but when I 
do badly on tests, I know it’s because 
[of] the last night gaming away on the 
computer,” said Sareen. “And games 
are really, really addictive once you 
get down to it.”

According to Revelle College soph-
omore Ray Phan, although there is a 
large population of students who play 
more interactive games like Guitar 
Hero 3 or Wii Sports, overenthusi-
astic gamers can sometimes isolate 
themselves from social situations.

“I’ve lost friends because of video 
games,” Phan said. “A lot of my friends 
play [World of Warcraft], and I’d call 
them to hang out, and they’d be like 
‘Oh, sorry, I’m busy playing W.O.W.’ 
And I’m like, ‘Fuck, dude, you can’t do 
that.’ So it gets really addicting.”

Phan attributes the over-obsession 
of some gamers to the fantasy element 
found in role playing games and real-
time strategy games, features which 
can often relieve students of their 
humdrum lives.

“It’s just fun; the fantasy of it,” 
Phan said. “It’s a bit of an escape from 
reality, I guess, because, you know, 
you can do homework, you can do 
your chem, your math, your science 
and reading and everything. Or you 
can be a guy who’s trying to save the 
world.”

However, many gamers who have 
found a balance between their school-
work, gaming hobbies and social life 
see such an obsession as extreme and 
unhealthy. Students like Thurgood 
Marshall College freshman Effren 
Jimenez, who spent about $2,000 on 

gaming equipment in high school, 
are wary of the excessive amount of 
time that gamers spend playing.

“I know when you’re a lot younger 
it can be very addictive,” Jimenez 
said. “You spend a lot of time on it. 
I have friends who spend like four, 
five hours a day, but personally, it was 
easy for me to put it down. I see it 
as a kind of escape from reality and, 
you know life is hard enough; you 
don’t need to sit around not doing 
anything.”

While Jimenez believes some peo-
ple take gaming too far, he also thinks 
UCSD’s atmosphere of student life 
and school system are conducive to a 
thriving gaming environment.

“We don’t have a football team; 
we don’t have any Division I [teams],” 
Jimenez said. “So I think gaming is 
where it’s at. Yesterday we were out 
playing Rock Band at my friend’s dorm 
room for like three hours because it’s  
a really cool game. You know, we’re all 
a little nerdy at UCSD.”

Although many students admit 
gaming tends to have an addictive 
hook, they are still defensive about 
the way in which the media sheds a 
negative light on the pastime. 

“It gets such a bad rap most of 
the time,” Orona said. “There was 
an article in the MQ making fun of 
gamers for violence, and its headline 
said ‘Kid playing Super Mario Galaxy 
jumps into space and dies.’ It’s stuff 
like that. It gets so obscure like that 
sometimes.”

Whether it’s in an organized tour-
nament like Winter Game Fest, with 
a group of friends, or alone among 
other online personalities, many 
UCSD students game to look for new, 
advanced kinds of entertainment in 
the form of video games.

Cape Town, London, Cairo — they were dots on a map to me when Winter Quarter began 
last year; fantasies and stereotypes. I 
wanted to make them something more, 
or at least one of them. I had no idea 
where I would study abroad. Perhaps 
Turkey, Italy or China. At the time, the 
task of choosing seemed impossible.

Having taken Italian language classes 
for a few years, Italy had been an obvi-
ous choice in my 
study-abroad selec-
tion. I was learning 
the culture from a 
textbook and had 
spent my summer 
between commu-
nity college and 
UCSD wandering 
the country’s northern parts. Italy was 
tangible, but I wanted the unknown. 

Now, on my winter break from the 
American University in Cairo, I find 
myself wondering about the experience 
of studying in another city, particularly 
one I have now spent nearly two weeks 
exploring on my winter vacation and 
one that appears to be more unknown 
than I had assumed a year ago: Rome. 

Hotel Laurentia, with its red-carpet-
ed lobby, bulky hotel key chains, dual 
twin beds, collection of tiny shampoo 
bottles and housekeeping service, made 
my first six nights in Rome feel like a 
vacation. And, I suppose, rightfully so.

The complimentary platter of 
breads, cheese, cereals, fruit and coffee 
available every morning, immaculately 
clean bathrooms, tucked bed corners, 
ever-lasting supply of fresh towels and 
friendly welcomes from the hotel’s staff 
prompted my contemplations of what 
it might have been like studying at the 
university down the street instead of 
passing through on vacation. 

I spent the second half of my trip 
to Italy in a friend’s small, third floor 
apartment. The ripe-tangerine couch, 
covered in a soft flower print sheet, sat 
adjacent to a small, classically decorated 

Christmas tree donning red -and-gold 
globes and an unevenly spun golden 
sash. 

When I spent the third of January 
wandering through the farmland coun-
tryside near my host’s apartment, which 
divides the city from the mountains, 
the quiet, suburban and un-trampled 
aspects of Rome one isn’t able to fully 
discover, even during an 11-night stay, 
settled back into my thoughts.

During the less-
eventful moments 
of my Roman vaca-
tion, like a bus ride 
across town or a 
supermarket run 
for orange juice and 
a pack of Camel 
Lights, I think about 

the little moments that separate visitors 
from residents. 

Hearing about someone’s day trip 
to Florence and another person’s last-
minute train ride from Paris, it’s easy 
to envy the simplicity of travel through 
Europe compared to the restrictions in 
Egypt: visas, border checks and regula-
tions dictating foreigner’s travel; run-
down trains, reckless minibus drivers 
and tourist convoys. 

Having spent four months in Cairo, 
my routine has become much like it 
was in San Diego. I go to classes, study, 
distract myself with movies and spend 
time with friends at restaurants, coffee 
shops or bars. However, trips to the pyr-
amids, down the Nile, into the Sahara 
— they are all interspersed between 
commonplace activities. I certainly 
would not have such opportunities had 
I remained my whole college career at 
UCSD.

But the routine has another side, one 
that is changing my perspectives and 
my view of the world: casually dodging 
cars as I cross the street at a walk signal, 
being careful not to accidentally board 
the women’s car on the metro, hearing 
the five calls to prayer each day ring-
ing out from the hundreds and maybe 

thousands of mosques throughout the 
city, being easily pegged as an outsider 
and overcoming a language barrier in 
even the most mundane of everyday 
tasks. 

How would this routine, and with it 
my world perspective, have been shaped 
differently had I studied in Rome? 
Enjoying penne all’arrabiata and brus-
chetta instead of falafel and hummus, 
red and white wines instead of mango 
juice and tea; miniskirts, stilettos and 
Dolce and Gabbana instead of hijabs, 
burkas and poorly made knock-offs; 
Catholicism instead of Islam. 

On Jan. 3, I spent the night drinking 
wine on a gaudy orange couch, staring 
at the 19-inch television under the four-
foot plastic Christmas tree. Watching 
“Natural Born Killers,” I thought to 
myself, “I could do this anywhere.” Cape

Four years ago, in a general chem-
istry class, Thurgood Marshall College 
senior Annalisa Perez spilled acid on 
Eleanor Roosevelt College senior Will 
Perez’s notebook. Embarrassed, she 
offered to buy him a new one. Little did 
she know, one year later, her acid-spill 
victim would be her future husband. 
Now in their second year of marriage, 
the Perezes are a college minority.

They scheduled their wedding 
around UCSD’s quarter system and 
married during spring break of their 
sophomore year. Despite the stressful 
combination of finals and last-min-
ute wedding planning, Annalisa was 
satisfied with the timing of her com-
mitment.

“I didn’t want to wait [to get mar-
ried] because life is going to get cra-
zier once we start med school and grad 
school,” Annalisa said. 

Despite their situation, the Perezes 
longed to commit. Just one year after 
dating, they both realized that they 
wanted to get married. 

“I know it sounds borderline cli-
che,” Will said, “but I knew after the 
first real deep conversation that we had 
that I wanted to spend the rest of my 
life with her. [My friends] kept on ask-
ing, ‘Are you sure? Are you sure?’ But 
after I told them that she’s the one, they 
were more receptive about it.”

Like the Perezes, Eleanor Roosevelt 
College junior Carmen Grageola also 
married during college.

“The big reason was that I felt I was 
ready,” Grageola said. “At age 17, all I 
wanted to do was go to school. At 18, I 
did see myself marrying young.” 

Like any college student, Grageola 
is busy; however, school is not her main 
focus. She works approximately 40 
hours a week at the UCSD Bookstore 
in addition to taking classes. She and 
her husband — who works two jobs 
and is in the Army Reserves — have 
two young children. While she works 

and attends class, her mother and her 
husband take care of her sons. 

With added family responsibilities 
of her own, Grageola doesn’t have the 
concerns of a typical college student. 

“Once you get married you don’t 
think about what to wear,” Grageola 
said. “You have to think about what 
to cook for dinner. [College students] 
have the luxury to do what they want 
to do without having to think about 
other people and how it’s going to 
affect people living in the same house-
hold.” 

Although her commitment to her 
family takes up much of her time, 
Grageola manages to study during her 
lunch breaks and at night, after her 
children are asleep.

 “When I study I have to really 
focus because I know I won’t have a 
second chance,” Grageola said.

Grageola also has difficulties man-
aging her social life and can only set 
aside two hours a month to catch up 
with her friends. The Perezes feel simi-
larly about their social ties. 

 “Just like any relationship, you want 
to spend more time with the person so 
you have to put other activities aside,” 
Will said. “First it was friends, then it 
was working out and now it’s sleep.” 

The Perezes noticed that after their 
marriage, their mindsets about school-
work became more focused and they 
became less preoccupied with things 
that would distract a typical, single col-
lege student. 

“I realize we have different back-
grounds and interests,” Will said. “I 
am trying to take notes intently on my 
laptop while the person next to me is 
on MySpace.” 

Due to the demanding responsibili-
ties of her family, Grageola’s interests 
have also evolved.

“I’m on the side of life where I 
already did it and I’m ready for some-
thing else,” she said. “Now just having 
coffee with friends and having a nice 
conversation for hours — that’s enough; 
it’s fulfilling … you’re settled down and 

thinking on a different level.”
According to Housing and Dining 

Services Director Mark Cunningham,  
there are 41 married undergraduates 
living in the Affiliated Residential 
Community Housing for married grad-
uate and undergraduate couples and in 
university-owned complexes such as 
Mesa Apartments and La Jolla del Sol. 
Thirty-five of the married undergradu-
ates have children. 

While their college lifestyle may 
have been different from the majority 

of their peers’, both Gageola and the 
Perezes are satisfied with their deci-
sion.

“I do get a little bit jealous, I’m not 
going to lie … but, at the same time, 
I feel so accomplished on so many 
levels,” Grageola said. “When I come 
home I have two little ones that run to 
me and say, ‘Mommy,’ [and] that makes 
up for everything else.”

Town, Ankara, London or Moscow. I 
could have done this in Buenos Aires, 
Mexico City or Cairo. I could do this 
in San Diego. 

It was a 30-minute bus ride from 
the Coliseum, the Vatican, the Trevi 
Fountain and the Pantheon. It may as 
well have been a 30-minute bus ride 
from the pyramids, the Sphinx or the 
shores of the Nile. It may as well have 
been 30 minutes from the Gaslamp 
Quarter or the San Diego Zoo. 

Even in 12 days, a routine start-
ed to emerge. But weaved among 
the work, the television and the pub 
was life as a foreigner: the challenge 
of language barriers, discovering 
history and understanding custom. 
It’s the routine, together with the 
struggles, the clashes and adven-
tures that make up experience and 
alter perspective. Studying in Cairo 
has been just the challenge and 
experience, the journey into the 
unknown that I sought during the 
long challenge of choosing where to 
study abroad. The routine is a part 
of that experience, and I am thrilled 
to have it.

This Winter Quarter, students all 
over UCSD will be staring down at 
maps, wondering where they might 
be next year. If faced with dots on a 
map again, I would still choose Cairo. I 
believe it is the place that challenged my 
world perspective the most, and helped 
me learn not just in the classroom, but 
also in the streets and the community. 
But all those other dots, those fanta-
sies and stereotypes, they offer whole 
worlds to explore as well. So perhaps, 
next time, I’ll choose Rome.

MONDAY, JANUARY 14, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  11

for the 30-28 win going into the break.
Ring discussed minimizing the 

service errors and making plays in all 
aspects of the game.

“There’s no magic or no secret 
formula,” Ring said. “We played well 
throughout the first game except for 
the end stretch and we played well 
throughout the second game. We 
needed to stay aggressive but continue 
to play in all phases.”

The words of encouragement didn’t 
seem to work in the early stages of 
game three as UCSD fell behind 20-15. 
Just when it seemed the Cougars had 
sealed the victory, UCSD put together 
a rally to tie the game at 22. Behind the 
crowd of 612 at RIMAC, the Tritons 
battled for a 28-26 lead and sophomore 
outside hitter Jason Spangler closed 
the game with a kill and a solo block 
to give UCSD a glimmer of hope in 
knocking off the nation’s No. 1 team.

“The crowd helped us tremendous-
ly,” he said. “They were into it and it 
seemed that they wanted us to win 
as badly as we did. We kind of played 
to the philosophy that you can give a 
team a game but not the next one.”

The momentum didn’t last, as BYU 
jumped out to a 19-12 lead early in 
game four, but the Tritons wouldn’t 
let their fans go home disappointed. 
Appearing to have lost all intensity 
after the game-three win, UCSD went 
on a 12-5 run to tie the game 24-24 
and took the lead on a Spangler kill 
26-25. 

Hardy and sophomore middle 
blocker Gerald Houseman put up a 
double block to give the Tritons a 29-
28 lead and game point. But the height 
and talent of the Cougars took over 
as they tallied two blocks and a kill to 
close out the game and the match.

Ring pointed to UCSD’s youth and 
inexperience as culprits for the loss.

“We definitely knew that we could 
play with them,” he said. “We’re a 

young team and are still learning how 
to play with one another. We have to 
keep our focus and be able to make the 
routine plays. The big blocks and aces 
are going to happen but we have to 
worry more about what we control.”

The rematch bore little resem-
blance to the intensity and quality of 
the previous night. Remnants of the 
disappointing loss seemed to linger 
over the Tritons in game one. Despite 
being behind by only two, the Tritons 
just didn’t have the same continuity 
and flow they had in the first meeting. 

BYU captured game one on back-
to-back kills and UCSD couldn’t recov-
er in the second game. The Cougars 
played almost flawlessly and the curse 
of missed serves returned as BYU 
pounded the Tritons for an easy win.

UCSD used an 8-2 run in game 
three to take a 20-17 lead. The advan-
tage stuck until 23-20 when BYU 
recorded back-to-back blocks to tie 
the game at 23. The two teams traded 
points and exchanged leads, but it 
would be BYU that stole the match on 
a kill and a block.

BYU out-blocked UCSD 39-20, 
which Ring attributed to experience.

“Blocking takes the longest to devel-
op after getting out of high school,” he 
said. “We’re young but the height they 
had on the wings doesn’t make a huge 
difference. They’re a veteran team and 
that was the biggest difference.”

Leserman was pleased with 
UCSD’s performance and echoed 
Ring’s sentiments that the team could 
win with some improvement at the 
service line.

“We contended with the No. 1 team 
in the nation and that was big,” he 
said. “We need to improve our serving 
though. A missed serve is losing out 
on an opportunity to win points for 
your team.”

play that tied the game and proved to 
be the final bucket in regulation.

UCSD took its first lead since the 
first half with 1:19 left in overtime. 
The teams traded leads twice over 
the final minute and headed into a 
second extra period after CSUDH’s 
Danny Tavares converted one-of-two 
free throws. Lawlor, having missed 
a potential game-winner in the first 
overtime, took charge in the second, 
scoring the first five UCSD points on 
a lay-up and a three-point basket that 
put the Tritons ahead for good with 
51 seconds left. Kim made one-of-two 
free throws, and Hatch made two from 
the charity stripe to ice the game as the 
defense forced two turnovers and held 
the Toros scoreless in the final minute.

“The game against CSUDH was 
a complete team effort,” Lawlor said. 
“Everyone stepped up to get done what 
needed to get done.”

Patterson led UCSD with team 
highs of 19 points and seven rebounds 
while Lawlor’s clutch performance was 
part of a 16-point evening. The Tritons 
were out-rebounded and out-shot 
throughout the game, but did shoot 50 
percent in the overtime periods.

“These games obviously put us 
through some adversity and it really 
shows how deep and good we can be,” 
Lawlor said. “We have a tough schedule 
coming up and we hopefully will learn 
from this and come out and get on top 
of teams from the beginning like we 
were earlier in the season.”

The Tritons now return home to 
play their next five games at RIMAC 
Arena. UCSD hosts Cal Poly Pomona 
on Jan. 18 before facing 6th-ranked Cal 
State San Bernardino on Jan. 19.

Five OT Periods Take Toll on Tritons

By Joe Tevelowitz
Senior Staff Writer

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The 
Tritons endured an exhausting road 
trip this weekend, defeating Cal State 
Dominguez Hills 78-74 in double over-
time on Jan. 11 before falling to Cal 
State Los Angeles 111-102 in a triple 
overtime contest on Jan. 12. After the 
back-to-back grueling contests, the 
Tritons’ overall record now stands at 
7-4 and 4-2 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association, leaving them tied 
for third in the CCAA standings.

“We certainly played a lot of min-
utes and so that’s certainly a cause for 
concern as we move on from here,” 
head coach Chris Carlson said.

After sophomore guard Jordan 
Lawley opened the scoring with a 
three-pointer against the Golden Eagles 
on Jan. 12, CSULA would gain an early 
advantage, leading by as much as seven 
through the first 10 minutes of the half. 
A 10-2 run by UCSD put the Tritons 
up by one with 9:52 left in the half, 
but the teams changed leads five times 
and found themselves in a dead heat 
on another five occasions, going into 
halftime locked at 30 points apiece. The 
teams stayed close in the second half, 
with a five-point Triton lead four min-
utes out of the break being the half ’s 
largest differential. The Tritons found 
themselves on the negative end of the 
seesaw battle, down four points with 
under two and half minutes remaining 

in regulation. UCSD would go on to 
score on consecutive possessions, how-
ever, with a jumper by junior forward 
Darryl Lawlor and a lay-up by senior 
guard Clint Allard tying the game at 66 
with less than a minute to play. 

After the Golden Eagles converted 
three-of-four from the foul line, the 
Tritons called a time-out with five sec-
onds to play. Down three, it was junior 
guard Kelvin Kim who would take and 
draw a foul on a three-point attempt 
with no time remaining. Kim won a 
game last season at the free-throw line 
for UCSD, and again came up big, nail-
ing all three free-throws to send the 
game into the first overtime period.

“Everyone has great faith in Kelvin’s 
abilities,” Carlson said. “Kelvin’s a win-
ner and I think all of us felt very, very 
calm in terms of him going to the line 
and shooting three [free-throws] to get 
us to overtime.”

While the Tritons would never lead 
in the first overtime period, they never 
trailed by more than four points. Stuck 
again in a deficit in the final minute 
of play, Lawley connected on his third 
three-pointer of the game off a Kim 
pass, cutting the Golden Eagles’ lead 
to one. A CSULA free-throw made it 
a one-possession game with only 13 
seconds to play. Junior forward Shane 
Poppen hit the offensive glass after a 
missed jumper by junior guard Andrew 
Hatch, collecting one of his career-high 
12 rebounds but missed a shot to tie the 
game. But junior guard Alan Husted 
secured the rebound and put it back for 
the tying bucket right at the buzzer. 

The Tritons would be the only team 
to lead in the second overtime peri-
od, though never by more than three 
points, as both squads scored seven 
points in the frame and sent it into a 

third overtime. CSULA pulled away in 
the final extra period, outscoring the 
Tritons 22-13 for the hard-fought win.

Lawley led five Tritons in double-
digit scoring with a double-double of 
20 points and 
a career-high 
10 rebounds. 
Kim added 
18 points, 
junior forward 
Henry Patterson scored 17, Allard had 
11 and Husted added 10 points on 4-
of-7 shooting off the bench. CSULA 
countered with six Golden Eagles scor-
ing double digits, led by a game-high 29 
points from Vincent Camper.

Five Tritons would put up double-
digit numbers the night before, with 
UCSD using two extra periods this time 
en route to a conference win. Again 
UCSD found itself in an early deficit, 
this time against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. After holding a slim lead in the 
first minute of play, the Tritons would 
trail for much of the half by as many as 
10 points. Though able to climb back 
in the game, the Tritons were only able 
to tie and lead for just five seconds with 
five minutes left in the half before a 15-
6 run gave the Toros an eight-point lead 
at the break. The Tritons were able to 
keep the game close in the second half, 
never again allowing CSUDH to take a 
double-digit advantage. UCSD would 
again tie the game briefly midway 
through the second half and, though 
unable to take the lead, never let it get 
beyond a two-possession game. The 
Tritons were finally able to take advan-
tage of remaining within striking dis-
tance as Lawlor knocked down a huge 
three-point basket with 37 seconds to WILL PARSON/GUARDIAN FILE

Sophomore forward Andrew Browning has contributed off the bench for UCSD, scoring 2.8 points per game in only 
11.1 minutes per contest and providing starters with much-needed rest in the five OT periods played in two days.

Road Trip Ends With Two CCAA Wins
By Janani Sridharan
Senior Staff Writer

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The No. 
21 women’s basketball team bounced 
back from two straight losses on the 
road by taking two California Collegiate 
Athletic Association wins, including a 
nail biter against Cal State Los Angeles 
to improve its overall record to 12-4. 
The Tritons fought hard in a tight away 
game to pull off a 60-59 victory on Jan. 
12. This came after the Tritons pulled 
away in the second half of another tight 
game to post a 65-52 win against Cal 
State Dominguez Hills on Jan. 11. 

From the start of their contest 
against CSULA, it was clear that the 
Tritons were in for a tough game. 
Junior forward Michelle Osier began 
the game with a three-point basket and 
senior forward Meaghan Noud added 
a jumper to give the Tritons a 5-0 lead 
to start the game. The Golden Eagles 
answered right away, taking their first 
lead of the game with 16:46 left in the 
first half.

UCSD and the Golden Eagles went 
back and forth in the first half with 
both teams keeping the game close. 
Noud led the Tritons in the first half 
with 10 points including two three-
point baskets, and Osier added nine 
points to help extend the Tritons’ lead 
to 32-28 at the end of the first half. 

The second half of the game started 
out well for the Tritons, who quickly 
took a nine-point lead after baskets 
from sophomore forward Erin Noonan, 
senior center Alexis Gaskin and Noud. 
The Golden Eagles continued to fight 
back, keeping the Tritons from opening 
up a big lead.

UCSD’s shooting troubles in the 
second half combined with CSULA’s 
comeback effort, bringing the game to 
a 59-59 tie with less than one minute 
left in regulation. With 22 seconds left 
in the game, Osier drew a foul and 
made one of two free-throw attempts to

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The UCSD 
men’s volleyball team had its chances 
against top-ranked Brigham Young 
University but couldn’t capitalize in key 
moments in its two contests against the 
No. 1 team in the country. The Tritons 
went down 30-21, 30-28, 27-30, 31-29 
on Jan. 11 and were then swept 30-27, 
30-22, 30-28 on Jan. 12.

Despite having late-game leads on 
both nights, UCSD was unable to close 
out the Cougars. Head coach Kevin 
Ring felt that the matches against BYU 
weren’t about No. 1 versus UCSD or 
Division I versus Division II.

“In this league you have to give 

yourself opportunities and we were 
able to do that,” he said. “Over the 
seven games we played against them, 
we had our chances in all but two of 
them. They’re No. 1 and they showed 
that coming up with big blocks to stop 
our runs.”

BYU dominated the first game on 
Jan. 11. The Cougars roared out to a 
23-20 lead and then scored 7-of-8 to 
take game one. 

UCSD settled in the second game, 
taking a 15-12 advantage after senior 
outside hitter Russ Hardy’s ace. The 
lead survived until the Cougars tied 
the game 26-26 on two Triton errors. 
BYU took a one-point lead and held on

give the Tritons a one-point advantage.
CSULA gained possession of the 

ball with time to run a play, but UCSD 
forced a turnover to seal the win.

“Different people stepped up in the 
win for us,” head coach Charity Elliott 
said. “[Sophomore guard] Annette Ilg 
had a huge deflection at the end of the 
game.”

Noud led the Tritons in scoring 
with 17 points, Osier added 13 points 
and nine rebounds and Ilg contributed 
eight points in the win.

UCSD pulled out the victory 
despite shooting 33 percent and losing 
the rebounding battle. The Tritons did 
make eight three-point baskets com-
pared to CSULA’s two.

UCSD started out on the road 
against Cal State Dominguez Hills. The 
Tritons started strongly in their first 
game of the weekend, taking a 17-7 lead 
seven minutes into the game backed by 
three baskets from Noonan. The Toros 
stormed back, eventually cutting the 
Tritons’ lead to four points with three 
minutes left in the first half.

Both teams shot over 50 percent, 
and the Tritons ended the first half with 
a 33-29 lead. 

The game remained close in the 
beginning of the second half with 
Noud helping the Tritons’ cause with 
two early three-point baskets. With 
13 minutes left in the game, the Toros 
threatened to take the lead after tying 
the game at 41. However, the Tritons 
denied the Toros and took control of 
the game. UCSD outscored CSUDH 
24-11 in the remaining minutes of the 
game giving the Tritons a 65-52 win.

The Tritons shot 51 percent in the 
game led by Noud with 24 points, 
Noonan with 15 points and Osier with 
14 points and 10 rebounds. 

“It was huge for us to get those 
wins,” Osier said. “To win leagues, we’ll 
probably have to win all our league 
games from here on out

The wins came at an important 

time for the Tritons as they had just 
suffered two consecutive losses for the 
first time this season.

“I think we bounced back and 
responded in two hard-fought com-
petitive games,” Elliott said. 

UCSD will continue its conference 
play at home against Cal Poly Pomona 
on Jan. 18 and Cal State San Bernardino 
on Jan. 19 and try to improve its 4-
2 CCAA record and move up from 
fourth place in the league.

“All our games are going to be 
hard,” senior guard Alexis Mezzetta 
said. “[CSUSB] is tied for first place 
and they have a really good post player 
so we have to play smart and work 
really hard.”
