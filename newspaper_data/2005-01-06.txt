Rule update reduces 
state's Pell Grant awards 

Critics charge formula 
changes violate federal law 

By SHANNON ELIOT 
Sen ior Staff Writer 

In respon e to the passage of 
an omnibu spending bill by 
Congress in November, the fed-
eral Department of Education has 
an nounced updated tax tables to 
be used in determining Pell 
Grant awards for college stu-
dents. 

Educators believe that the revi-
sions, which will take effect in the 
2005-06 academic year, will cause 
some currently eligible students to 
have their Pell Grants significantly 
reduced or lost entirely, despite an 
approved overall $400 million 
increase in funding for the pro-
gram. 

While the Department of 
Education attempted to update tax 
tables in recent years, various con-
gressional delays and "rider" pro-
visions attached to legislation have 
prevented change, mandating the 
use of outdated 1988 tables in 
financial aid judgments since 
1994. 

The implementation of the 
new system means that 48 states 
will see a decrease in their current 
Pell Grant eligibility; New Jersey 
will see no change in income that 
parents can exclude from fman-
cial-need calculations and 
Connecticut exclusions will 
increase by 1 percent. California 
allowances will decline by 1 per-
cent. 

The reduction in eligibility is 
the result of lower state taxes, 
which make it appear that a stu-
dent's family has more dispensable 
income that can be applied toward 
higher education than under the 
old formulas . 

The new tables, based on 2002 
tax data, have become the subject 
of intense partisan debate. Both 
supporters of the change and oppo-
nents have claimed that their poli-
cies are in the best interest of stu-
dents. 

Chairman of the House 
Education and Workforce 
Committee Rep. John Boehner (R-
Ohio) defended the use of more 
recent tax information in financial 

aid calculations. 
"Updating the tax tables 

ensures that Pell Grants are going 
to the neediest students attending 
coll ege - the very students Pell 
Grants were created to assist in 
the first place," Boehner stated in 
a press release issued by the com-
mittee's Republicans . "Keeping 
the 1988 tables intact means pre-
serving the status quo, including 
budget shortfalls as fa r as the eye 
can see. Low-income students 
deserve to know that the federal 
government is doing everything it 
can to keep the Pell Gram pro-
gram on stable financial footing. " 

However, R presentative 
George Miller (D-CaJif.), a senior 
Democrat on the House Education 
and Workforce Committee, criti-
cized the changes made by the 
Department of Education in a Dec. 
22 statement. 

"This holiday season, the Bush 
administration is leaving lumps of 
coal in the stockings of hardwork-
ing college students and their fam-
ilies," Miller said. "For over a mil-
lion college students already 
struggling to afford the skyrocket-
ing cost of tuition, the Bush 
administration's Grinch-like pri-
orities will put higher education, 
and the opportunities that come 
with it, even further out of reach. 

The administration and 
Congress should do everything 
they can to make college more 
affordable. But by making this 
change, they are raising the price 
of college." 

Approximately 89,000 appli-
cants eligible for a Pell Grant 
under current tax tables will lose 
their Pell Grants using the new 
tables, and an additional 1.3 mil-
lion students could see a Pell 
Grant reduction anywhere from 
$100 to $300, according to the 
American Council on Education. 
The total number of Pell Grant 
recipients is expected to increase 
slightly in the coming year 
because more students will be eli-
gible for aid.

Bill to mandate visa interviews 
Provision could delay internationals 

By SHANNON EUOT 
Senior Staff Writer 

International students wishing 
to obtain a visa will remain sub-' 
ject to in-person interviews as a 
result of intelligence reform leg-
islation passed by Congress in 
December. T he bill , while largely 
focused on security and intelli -
gence policy, contains a small 
provision that forbids the State 
Department from granting visas 
without interviewing individual 
applicants, with a few exemptions 
for diplomats and members of 
international organizations, such 
as NATO. 

The passage of the added visa 
clause came a month after new 
studies showed that international 
student enrollment in U.S. univer-
sities had reached histori low' n 
recent years and is steadily dinun-
ishing. ccording to a November 
report released by the Council of 
Graduate Schools, the number of 
first-time international graduate 
students in the nation decreased 
between 6 and 10 percent for 
three consecutive years. 

The study also found that 
total international graduate stu-
dent enrollment - including 
first-time and continuing stu-
dents - decreased by 3 percent, 
compared with a 1- to 2-percent

decrease of domestic graduate 
students. 

The report also noted that 
many students are dissuaded 
from studying in the United 
States because of the stringent 
visa requirements and a process 
that is often plagued with delays. 
In an attempt to reverse the 

declining enrollment trend and 
make the country more appealing 
to academics from overseas, 
higher education advocates have 
been lobbying the State 
Department to offer certain 
interview exemptions to students

IRS drops proposed student taxes 
ReguiatioI1S may affect medical residents 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
News Editor 

The Internal Revenue Service 
has abandoned a proposal that 
universities predicted would have 
imposed millions of dollars in new 
taxes on college students working 
on campus. 

In particular, educators said the 
proposed changes could have sub-
jected graduate students, teaching 
assistants and residential advisors 
to extra payroll taxes and made it 
more costly for universities -
many already facing slashed fund-
ing from states - to hire them. 

However, the agency enacted 
new rules that more strictly define 

. the nature of part-time jobs quali-
fying for reduced student tax rates. 

"They made some improve-
ments to the earlier regulations, 
but I think we still have to wait to 
see how the IRS will apply these 
regulations before we can render a 
judgment on them," said Bertrand 
M. Harding Jr., a lawyer in 
Alexandria, Va., and an expert on 
tax issues affecting colleges. 

The final tax code changes, 
approved by the IRS and its par-
ent Treasury Department, adjust 
provisions that had traditionally

Historically, the IRS has ruled 

that medical students could not

by Congress for students who 
work part-time while at school.

I BRIEFLY 
Regents name Washington 
dean as UCSC chancellor 
The UC Board of Regents voted in 

December to appoint Denice Dee Denton, 
dean of the College of Engineering at the 
University of Washington, as the new chancel-
lor of the university's Santa Cruz campus. 

Denton will take over the position left 
vacant by M.R.e. Greenwood, who became the 
University of Califomia's senior vice president 
of academic affairs. 

The 4S-year-old's nomination had been 
backed by university President Robert C. 
Dynes, who picked her as his top choice out of 
more than 700 prospects produced by a 
national search committee. 

"uc Santa Cruz is a campus on the move, 
and Denice Denton brings the perfect skills and 
credentials to build on the momentum created 
[by her predecessors]," Dynes said. 

~enton, who holds four degrees in engi-
neenng. has been credited With increasing 
access to technical education at University of 
Washington for student populations that tradi-
tlonally'had lagged in entering science-related 
career fields. 

The White House recognized Denton in 
May 2004 for her role i~ enhancing diversity in 
sCience a.nd englneenn~ by honoring her 
among nine sct10lars given a Presidential 
Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics 
and Engineering Mentoring. 

'The campus' expanding intemational repu-
tation for academic excellence is a testament to 
the work of its outstanding students and facul-
ty: Denton said. 'I am eager to be.gin working 
with them, as well as with the dedicated staff, 
alumni, neighbors and friends of UC Santa 
Cruz, to continue the progress that has been 
made and to take on the exciting challenges 
that lie ahead~ 

She will receive an annual salary of 
$275,000, a 2-percent increase over the posi-
tion's current pay.

ments that pose no ongoing danger, violates 
federal law. 

The intelligence agency had denied 
Berman's earlier request for the documents, 
arguing that they were protected by a "delib-
erate-process" exclusion to FOI, which allows 
government officials to keep certain docu-
ments used during the decision-making 
process secret. 

However, the lawsuit alleges that the 
exemption is not available for the CIA, which is 
forbidden by federal law from providing policy 
advice to the president. 

Berman has pointed to PDBs, one from 
.1998 and one from . 290 I, that were!ublished 
In the 9/11 CommiSSIon Report an previous 
briefs from the Johnson administration 
released before the CIA imposed its secrecy 
policy. 

'Together, these releases prove that the 
briefs should be reviewed and declassified like 
any other records, not set aside in a perma-
nently dosed vaul~" he stated in a press brief-
ing. 

Asian earthquake was 
predicted, researchers say 
Scientists at UC Davis' Center for 

Computational Science and Engineering said 
that they predicted in as early as 2000 the 
location of the magnitude 9.0 earthquake that 
caused a deadly tsunami, killing at least 
150,000 people in Southeast Asia. 

Using computer models of past quakes, the 
researchers said they had anticipated that an 
earthquake with a magnitude of 7 or greater 
was likely to strike the Indian Ocean in a 10-
year period ending in 2010. 

Speaking before the American 
Geophysical Union less than two weeks 
before the Dec. 26 disaster, geology professor 
Donald Turcotte presented a map by the 
school's Quakeism project that identified the 
waters off the coast of Indonesia as a 
"hotspot.' 

The map has identified 30 of the 38 major 
earthquakes that occurred worldwide since 
2000, including an October temblor on a pre-
viously unknown fault in Japan. 

"The information could allow govern-
ments and agencies to make informed deci-
sions about where to locate critical infrastruc-
ture and supplies and to set priorities for allo-
cating resources for emergencies or carrying 
out seismic strengthening and retrofits," stat-
ed John Rundle, the center's director. "We 
can't prevent these devastating events, but 
we can provide tools so that people can take 
steps to reduce the potential damage and 
loss of life.'

productive. According to Pae, a new agree-
ment governing the co-op satellite, which will 
be in Price Center, is in the final stages. Pae 
asked councilmembers if they supported a 
GSA recommendation that the council hire a 
lawyer to review the document before approv-
ing it. Among the issues discussed were the 
legal nuances of diction in the agreement and 
the cost of hiring a lawyer. After discussion, 17 
members of the council supported hiring a 
lawyer and seven oppoSed the action, with 10 
members expressing no opinion.

THUR DAY, JANUARY 6, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Visas: Provision part of major reform package 
. continued from page I 

and scholars applying for visas. 
Though the department had 
originally said it was unlikely to 
do so, the new law takes the deci-
sion out of its hands. 

In a statement, the Association 
of International Educators said it 
was disappointed with the visa 
stipulation in the intelligence 
overhaul package. 

"The provision, which is even 
more restrictive than the original 
State Department [practice], con-
stitutes a setback for the efforts of 
[our group) and colleague associa-
tions to ea e post-9/11 visa 
requirements to fa ci litate the 
entry of legitimate visitors to the 
United Statc:.s," the organization 
stated. 

Assistant Secretary of State for 
Consular Affairs Maura Harty dis-
agreed that a delay in the is uance 
of visas poses a major problem for 
mternational students. In an edi-
torial appearing in the Cbronicle of 
Hiher &ill(otion, Harty stated that 
most student applicants receive 
visa appointment within one 
week - some receive them the 
next day if requested. In addition, 
new reforms in the process used to 
run a pplicant security checks have 
reduced previou problems and 
provide greater accounrability, she 
sta ted. 

":rhe loss of even one quali-
fied student to another nation is 
one too many," Harty stated. 
"When a student goes elsewhere 
... we have lost the chance for a 
student to see the wonders of 
America through his or her own 
eyes, rather than through the 
prism of a foreign news media 
outlet that may be biased. A 
young person's positive experi-
ence in America strengthens and 
enriches our nation [and) we are 
informed every day in what we do 

by our desire to welcome those 
students to our shores." 

CGS Director of Research and 
Policy Analysis Heath Brown said 
he recognized the balance 
between the need for reforms in 
the visa process and proper securi-
ty. 

"The problem has been that 

" ~ ~ cannot argue 
that we should be less 

security-minded, we can 
argue that thinking in purely 
security terms is not alwzyS 

the best approoch far 
intemational education. II 
- Michael Hincl~ associate 

diredor, International Center 

the bureaucratic process has been 
too delayed," Brown said. "We 
would like to see continued 
improvement in reducing delays 
while adheri ng to other security 
needs. However, we do need a 
process that has enough securi ty 
checks so students who might 
not have good illlentions are 
caught." 

Holding individual interviews 
with every visa applicant also 
opens the door to ethnic profiling, 
which may result in backlogs, as 
consulates try to keep up with 
demand, according to Associate 
Director of UCSD International 
Center Michael Hindi . Without 
profiling, it would be impossible 
for officials to process all of the 
required applications, he said. 

"It seems to me that burying an 

Sky captain and the 
World of Tomorrow 

issue that is so important to uni-
versities in this intelligence reform 
bill was a way to get this done qui-
etly, without providing universi-
ties the opportunity to have their 
say," Hindi stated in an e-mail. "I 
think that many voices in the U.S . 
Department of State, even if they 
were given adequate resources, 
would argue that they should be 
left a bit more discretion to decide 
when to call visa applicants in for 
an interview." 

UCSD is fourth in the nation 
among institutions bringing in 
international professors and 
researchers, according to Hindi. 
In 2003-04, its 1,949 internation-
al scholars outnumbered the 
campus' 1,8 11 international snl-
denrs. 

The visa requiremellls in the 
bill will likely have negative effects 
on universities involved in inter-
national research, he said. 

"Without question, the provi-
sion in the intelligence reform bill 
will continue to plague the 
researcher who travel frequently, 
and their families," Hindi tated. 
"In addition, it will likely contin-
ue to cost the uni versi ty a very 
large sum of money in the delays 
that will be imposed on research 
units." 

In addi tion to security fears, 
lawmakers must consider the ben-
efits international students offer 
to the country, he explained. 

"Although we cannot argue 
that we should be less security-
minded, we can argue that think-
ing In purely security term is not 
always the best approach for 
international education," Hindi 
stated. "People who learn togeth-
er and learn to respect each other 
end up doing business together."

NEW. 

Grant: Tax group supported 
changes to state tax tables 

continued from page I 
sions will save the government 
approximately $300 million. 
Boehner said the savings were nec-
essary to balance the growing 
shortfall in Pell Grant funding that 
exceeds $3 billion. The deficit has 
resulted from an unexpectedly 
higher number of qualified stu-
dents applying for aid than 
Congress has budgeted for over the 
past several years. 

Higher education advocates 
have criticized the cuts to Pell 
Grant rolls. ational Association 
of Student Financial Aid 
Administrators President Dallas 
Martin condemned the decision to 
update the tables. 

"The Education Department's 
decision to proceed with the out-
dated and methodologically flawed 
revisions to their federal need 
analysis [and to) state and other tax 
tables means that many needy stu-
dents will be forced to go deeper 
into debt to pursue their postsec-
ondary education plans in the next 
academic year," Martin stated in a 
Dec. 23 issue of NASFAA's Todoy's 
Nws publication. 

Martin also questioned the 
legality of changes made by the 
Education Department. In a let-
ter to outgoing Education 
Secretary Rod Paige, he wrote 
that the government would be 
violating provisions of federal law 
by making table adjusonenrs 'after 
June I. 

"Not meeting the date in the 
law, we believe, precludes the 
issuance of updated tables for acad-
emic year 2005-06 and that fact , we 
believe, would be upheld in a law-
suit," Martin said. 

Martin reiterated this point in a 
statement issued by the organi za-
tion after the updated tables were 

announced, one month after the 
passage of the omnibus bill. 

"Despi te objections from 
NASFAA and many others about 
how these changes arc bci ng 
made, it appears that there is little 
likelihood of sufficient congres-
sional SUppOT{ to stop this imple -
mentation," Martin said. "The 
only scenario I can envision to 
forestall these changes would be 
for a person or persons with 
standing - who are negatively 
impacted by the change - to take 
legal action against the depart-
ment for not publishing these 
[tables] by the required June I 
deadline." 

Ilowevcr, a major anti-tax 
nonprofit interest group 
expressed support for the 
changes, saying that keeping out-
dared [aX information would onlv 
add to the problem o f ri~in g coI'-
lege costs. 

"[The ational 1,lXpayer 
Union] is concerned th at the out-
dated tax tables may be leading ro 
a misallocation of bud get 
resource, which in turn, onl y 
puts pressure on the budget fo r 
more Pell Grant funding increas-
es from political advocates of the 
program," TU Vice President 
for Communications Peter ]. 
Sepp stated in an e-mail. "Many 
students and their families who

Campus committees 
need transparency 

I n November, the Transportation Policy Committee met behind 
closed doors to vote in sup-
port of a plari to slash stu-
dent parking. According to 
chair Daniel Arovas, the 
hearing was not opened to 
the public for fear that 
observers could unduly 
inHuence the student and 
staff representatives who 
make up most of the voting 
seats on the committee. 

The TPC is not alone in 
barring public scruti ny; a 
whole hos t of advisory 
boards meet behind closed 
doors, including th e new 
Closed Circuit T · 
Governance Committee. 

Though college coun-
cils and Associated 
Students are asked to 
appoi nt representatives to 
these boards, 'such prac-
tices keep students from 
ensuri ng that their inter-
e ts are in fact represent-
ed . On the contrary, this 
very fear - th at tral1S-

portation committee 
members would feel oblig-
ated to vote in the interest 
of their constituents if they 
could observe the proceed-
ings - results in a process 
that lacks any semblance of 
transparency, a corner-
stone of democracy. 

The university has 
already ruled that 
California's strict open 
meeting laws and public 
access protections do not 
cover its advisory boards. 
However, administrators 
must take steps to restore 
the legitimacy of commit-
tees that are designed to 
provide public participation 
In th e making of university 
policie. 

Without full public 
access, these already purely 
advisory boards will lose 
their remaining relevance 
to students. Considering 
the impact many of these 
committees have on student 
life, that would be quite a 
shame. 

Funding shouldn't be 
tied to recruiter access 

T he federal Third Circuit Court of Appeals erred in rul-
ing that guaranteed campus 
access for military recruiters 
violates univerSIties' First 
Amendment rights. 

Universities should have 
the right to ban military 
recruiters from their cam-
puses, just as they can bar 
any other employer from 
soliciting new hires on pri-
vate property. However, 
permitting campus recruit-
ment by the armed forces 
does not, as the court ruled, 
necessarily mean that a uni-
versity endorses the mili-
ta1),'s anti-gay message any 
more than allowing corpo-
rate recruitment implies 
support of company prod-
ucts or brands. 

As an employer, the mili-
tary should be treated just 
as any other employer 
would . Educators, who 
pride themselves on dis-
seminating new ideas, 

should not serve as censors, 
but should provide students 
with as many career oppor-
tunities as possible. It is the 
dutY of students to decide 
for' themselves which mes-
sages are personally accept-
ab1e. . 

Though the court's opin-
ion employed faulty lOgIC, it 
was correct in recognizing 
the ineptness of the 
Solomon Amendment, 
which withholds all federal 
funds from campuses that 
ban recrui rers. 

These uniVerSltleS 
should not be stripped of 
student financial aid money 
and other government 
funds administered by fed-
eral health and labor 
departments that are com-
pletely unrelated to the 
Department of Defense. If 
the government wishes to 
tap colleges for military 
recruits, it should offer 
them incentives, not sanc-
tions.

Procedural miscues 
overshadow voter intent 

By MARIANNE MADDEN 
Associate Opinion Editor 

Here we go again - another election that doesn't 
provide closure, but acts as the starring point for 
months of legal wrangling. In the ring this time are 
Donna Frye, the maverick San Diego city council-
woman who launched a surprisingly successful write-
in campaign for mayor, and incumbent Republican 
Dick Murphy. 

vinced that voters who wrote Frye's name but did not 
fill in the bubble intended to vote for her." So voters 
took the time to go to the polls and write in Donna 
Frye's name because - they didn't suppOrt her for 
mayor} There are better ways to show your disap-
proval of a candidate, such as voting for someone 
else. 

Murphy said in the same U'lion -Tribune article, 
U['m not sure we'll ever know what the intent of 
those voters were." For the sake of honesty, he 
should have said, "I sure hope we never know what 
the intent of those voters was," because it's obvious 

Especially in the last four years, American elec-
tions have become less about the will of the people 
and more about legal challenges. 
Uncontested elections are becoming , , 
oddities. At the root of the problem 
are voters who can't seem to muster 
the attention to detail it takes to cast 
a ballot that follows all the rules and 
is impervious to disqualification. 

the thousands of people who wrote in 
"Donna Frye" as their choice for 
mayor supported Frye. Frye herself 
doesn't mince words: [n a Dec. 31 
Union- Tribune article she said, "If vot-
ers actually took the time to write in 
someone's name, it's real clear what 
they intended to do." In this mayoral race, more than 

5,000 voters - a margin large 
enough to give Frye a victory over 
Murphy - wrote in her name for 
mayor, but failed to fill in the corre-
sponding bubble. Registrar of 
Voters Sally McPherson refused to 
count those ballots, saying the bub-
bling that some voters neglected "is 
required by state law." 

Hopefully those 5 ,000 voters 
have learned their lesson and will 

Especially in the 
last four years, 

American elections 
have became less 

about the wiU of the 
people and more 

about legal 
challenges. " 

In any case, this mindless debate 
over voter intent has been trumped by 
endless wrangling over the law - the 
law that was originally used to throw 
out thousands of Frye ballots, giving 
Murphy a thin margin over his 
Democratic challenger. On Dec. 31, 
two formal challenges to the results of 
the race were filed, both calling for 
Frye to be declared the winner. One 

follow directions more carefully next time. But 
what's more important, the letter of the law, or voter 
intent? And can legal chalJenges to the official elec-
tion results, which declared Murphy the winner, suc-
ceed? 

As lawsuits continue to mount, Murphy has made 
a hobby of championing an untenable position in 
regards to voter intent. A Dec. 15 San Diego Union-
Tribune article reports that "[Murphy) is not con-

suit calls upon the City Council to 
excercise its right to "judge" the election, which i 
delineated in the city charter; the other suit contends 
that San Diego's election rules - which do not 
specifically require bubbling - take precedence over 
the rules of the State Legislature because San Diego 
is a charter city. 

It's tough to judge whether these legal objec-

"Don't vote." 
Some years ago, a 

student in John Muir 
College posted a flyer with that 
slogan in his dorm room window. 
For his transgression, he claimed, 
he was assaulted by one of that 
year's student government candi-
dates, who feared that the flyer 
would incite even lower voter 
turnout. Participation in UCSD's 
student elections typically ranges 
from about one-tenth to one-
third of the student body, so the 
candidate's panic had some legiti-
macy. 

After some bad press all 
around, a few disqualification 
hearings, and some indignant cries 
about the First Amendment, the 
incident was forgotten by all stu-
dents who have not spent 30 hours 
poring over Geisel Library's 
GUllrdian archives. 

With help from an electoral 
gimmick straight out of Russia, 
this year. could have seen the res-
urrection of that Muiron's quest to 
promote apathy. 

The A.S . Council addressed a 
proposal - tabling it indefinitely 
on Jan . 5, but discussing it 
nonetheless - to add a "no confi-
dence" option to the spring ballot. 
Were such a measure approved, a 
candidate running without opposi-
tion wouldn't be able to take office 
unless he or she beat the "no con-
fidence" option. 

In the past couple of years, 
dozen~ of candidates have faced 

no opponents, thanks to the 
dominance of large political 
m:lchines, such as Students Firstr, 
which have succeeded in domi-
nating most of the competition. 
Under the proposed change, even 
a candidate running against 
nobody could still lose a race. 

Voters in Russia have this 
same choice. T he president must 
win more votes than "none of the 
above," otherwise the govern-
ment calls for an electoral do-
over and runs the election a sec-
ond time . 
Nothing quite 
that drastic here: 

" 

otherwise have been filled by 
another candidate. In the ensuing 
postelection power vacuum, the 
disqualified candidates would 
apply to fill the vacancies. This 
way, even if others run for every 
position, the slate sti ll has a 
chance to take power. 

But that's just a conspiracy 
theory. Others could take advan-
tage of it as well; by no means are 
electoral plots limited to a single 
party. It's just that, as with all 
things political, it's far easier for a 

A committee 
would fill UCSD's 
empty positions 
through appoint-
ments, not an 
election rerun. 

1'm surprised that 
few people have 

political machine 
to abuse the sys-
tem than it is for 
the average man. 

Speaking of

Webster wouldn't 
have taken office if 
this "no confi-

been in effect.

quarter's campus 
politics was cov-
ered by pundits 
running UCSD-
centric Web logs 
and online 
forums. Far tOO 
much space has 
already been ded-
icated to promot-
ing these egotists, 
so I won't bother 
with much h.:re. 

user. Thousands of 
UCSD students 

check their Facebook 
accounts every day." Suffice it to say 

that it's great 

"abstain" by almost 100 votes. But 
thanks to the wholesale disqualifica-
tion of the Students First! party, he 
took office and is a quite competent 
vice president. 

Conspiracy theorists could see 
a proposal like this as a scheme to 
preempt another slatewide dis-
qualification . Anticipating their 
party's elimination, the slate lead-
ers could instead instruct their 
supporters to vote for "no confi-
dence" in the races that would

start paying attention to their 
campus. Good for all those 
anonymous bloggers getting us 
riled up, even if they'll never 
approach the quality of http://caJ-
stuff.blogspot.com, UC Berkeley's 
most prominent student-run 
blog. 

It's just a shame that there isn't 
one single, all-inclusive forum 
where students can mingle online. 
Viewing the world through politi-
ca l goggles, it's also a shame there 

isn't a single meeting place that 
campus activists can use to incite 
debate, ,discussion - and maybe a 
riot or two. 

Facebook, at http://w'UTIJ).tbr-
faceboolc.com, comes close. I'm sur-
prised that few people have taken 
advantage of the site's S 14 offer to 
advertise to every UCSD 
Facebook user. Thousands of 
UCSD students check their 
Facebook accounts every day. 
They're a captive audience for 
someone selling his computer, 
recruiting for her sorority, or 
organizing a mass march to 
protest UCSD's declining 
Singaporean-American enroll-
ment. 

If a Web site can start turning a 
profit based on advertising, so can 
UCSD. Captive audiences we 
have; money, we don't. Imagine 
the naming rights for a lecture 
hall, or even a classroom. Selling 
out? Yeah, but who cares? I 'll hap-
pily watch a concert at the 
Nintendo (formerly RIMAe) 
Arena, if the concert is free 
because of the venue's name. 

It's not so unrealistic. Think 
of the Jacobs School of 
Engineering, named after the 
founders of San Diego-based 
tech company Qualcomm. They 
practically own our engineering 
department for crying out loud. 
The Preuss School? Named after 
a rich UC regent. Price Center? 
Named after some guy named 
Price who donated a bunch of 
money. Geisel Library? Named 
after Theodore Geisel - Dr. 
Seuss - after his widow donated 
millions of dollars to the school. 
Student Center? Named for R. J. 
Student, famed tanooki 
researcher and billionaire philan-
thropist - OK, not really. The 
other ones are real though.

Tax: Medical schools may sue over rules in court 
continued from page I 

dents could qualify for the special 
student exemption. Deciding to 
drop the appeals in the cases, the 
Treasury Department and revenue 
service chose to instead rewrite the 
tax code last February. 

The changes drew criticism 
from universities, which argued 
that four new provisions proposed 
by the government were too broad. 
In addition to students working 
more than 40 hours a week, the 
IRS propos.:J taking away the tax 
exemptions from students in jobs 
requiring a special license and "the 
consistent exercise of discretion 
and judgment" and those doing 
work "that is predominantly intel-
lectual and varied in character." 

If interpreted strictly, Harding 
warned that the rules could have 
been used to apply to almost any 
student. 

"The IRS kind of went over-
board in revising the regulations," 
said Michael O'Neill, manager of 
tax and payroll services for the UC 
Office of the President. 

In particular, universities worried 
that the provisions could exclude 
graduate students and residential 
advisors, who often receive other 
benefits in addition to pay - an 
automatic disqualification under the 
proposed rule . uch a change would 
have meant that employing these 
students would cost schools nearly 8 
percent more, since the universities, 
as employers, would have been 
required to pay half of the new taxes. 

"[The rules] caught a lot of 
graduate students and made it so 
they could not take advantage of 
the exemption," said Ivy S. Baer, 
director of health care affairs and a 
regulatory counsel with the 
American Association of Medical 
Colleges. 

Representing UCSD School of 
Medicine and four other UC med-

ical schools among its members, 
the group has long lobbied to 
expand the student tax benefits to 
medical residents. 

At a June hearing, colleges also 
expressed worry that the strict new 
provisions wl)u1d include student 
shuttle drivers, who must have spe-
cial driver's licenses, and other stu-
dent employees who previously 
qualified for the lower student taxes. 

Revisions protect most students 
In response to concerns, the 

IRS revised many of the rules in 
final tax code changes released in 
late December. 

Praised by the National 
Association of College and 
University Business Officers, the 
updated regulations promise to use 
the nature of the work and need for 
special licensing only as "relevant 
factors," and not as criteria for 
automatic disqualification. 

"The changes that the IRS 
made seem to be very favorable to 
higher education," O 'Neill said. "I 
don't think there will be any impact 
on graduate student employees or 
undergraduate employees." 

Under the new rules that take 
effect in April, the UC will not 
start assessing new taxes on Stu-
dents, according to 0' cill. 

"We won't really have to change 
much of what we're doing," he 
said. "I don't see any student now 
having to pay taxes that they 
haven't before." 

However, because the IRS will 
still be the final arbiter of how the 
"relevant factors" are considered, 
the agency may opt for a strict inter-
pretation that may sti ll force addi-
tional students to begin paying new 
payroll taxes, Harding cautioned. 

"I'm not terribly thrilled with 
the final regulations, to tell you the 
truth," he said. "I think it still 
leaves open the question of 

TIiii /,i;inceton 
L!!Review 

whether graduate students will be 
subject to these taxes." 

The IRS has not estimated 
whether the updated tax code will 
result in additional tax revenue and 
increased collection, according to 
Raphael Tutino, the agency's 
Southern California spokesman. 

Medical students to face taxes 
Though the government 

relaxed some of the rules in the 
original proposal, the final regula-
tions induded the firm 4O-hour-
per-week limit for students who 
wish to qualify for the exemption. 

The cap will effectively exclude 
medical students, who often work 
as many as 80 hours each week. 

"We all know medical students 
work long hours," Baer said, sug-
gesting that the ceiling was specifi-
cally targeted at them. 

The changes will not affect stu-
dents at UC medical schools, 
according to O'Neill, because the 
university has always treated them 
as professional employees and 
made the necessary deductions 
from their paychecks. 

Medical schools, though, will 
likely challenge the new regula-
tions in court, charging that they 
are anempts by the tax agency to 
nulli fy medical srudents' previous 
court victories, Baer said . 

"r think you can make a legiti-
mate argume nt that a federal 
court's decision trumps an agency's 
decision-making," she said. 

As required by federal law, the 
IRS first published the proposed 
rules in February, soliciting written 
and in-person comments. The 
finalized changes, approved in 
December, took into account some 
conerns raised during the publjc-
input period.

Bush, 'Bill' and the biopic 
rule a wild year in film 

BySARAHMAK 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

What a year: Bush is in his second term and Britney got married a second time. Martha "It's a good thing" 
Stewart is now doing time for doing 

something that wasn't so good. In 
February, Americans were up in arms about 
Janet's breast, and not so up in arms about 
watching a breast augmentation on reality 
TV. A random engineer from Berkeley is 
now rolling in cash for being, well, shit at 
singing. Americans gathered together to 
mourn the loss of six familiar friends and 
four ladies who loved their Manolo 
Blahniks. Inded, if art truly imitates life, 
I'm still waiting for the film to come out. 
Sadly, such was not the case with the 
movies of 2004, but here anyway is the req-
uisite roundup of the year's most important 
mOVles. 

In "Finding Neverland," Johnny Depp 
took off the eyeliner to become the author 
of the much-loved "Peter Pan." It was the 
commendable performance of young 
Freddie Highmore that stole the scene in 
the movie, leaving everyone reaching for 
a tissue. 

Zach Braff, of "Scrubs" fame, toole 
off his scrubs and had his directorial and 
screenwriting debut in the summer hit 
"Garden State," a quirky romance that 
gave everyone a nice, fuzzy, warm feeling 
inside. 

Encroaching upon his teenage years, 
Harry Potter returned to screens in June in 

the third installment of the popular Harry 
Potter series. In "Harry Potter and the 
Prisoner of Azkaban," Mexican director 
Alfonso Cuaron toole on the mammoth task 
of following in the success of the previous 
Potter films, but he won critics' and fans' 
approval alike with his darker, edgier style. 
Both kids and adults were treated to "The 
lncredibles" in November, where Pixar 
continued its winning streak with a movie 
that was, well, incredible. 

Gore was a key theme in many of 2004's 
movies; one need only bring up Mel 
Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ." The 
gore factor in Gibson's epic was exceeded 
only by Trey Parker and Man Stone's 
"Team America." Only the makers of South 
Park could dream up a movie where pup-
pets get political and save the world with a 
few bumps and humps along the way. 

After a long wait, Asian film buffs were 
treated to the much anticipated "Hero" and 
"House of Flying Daggers," both by 
esteemed Chinese director Zhang Yimou. 
Also from Asia was "Infernal Affairs," the 
tale of a mole in the Hong Kong police and 
an undercover cop in a Hong Kong 
triad. If flying daggers weren't 

your weapon of choice, 
then perhaps 
cricket bat 

ought to do

The year of rock finally 
By IAN S. PORT 

Hiatus Editor 

Whoa,2004. It was a year of unending intensity, &om the agonizing quagmire in that 
all-too-familiar Middle Eastern country to 
the sour taste of disunity left after an appro-
priately embittering election. 

But in 12 months that seemed to leave 
us all feeling a bit less secure, pop music -
led specifically by rock 'n' roll - managed 
to stand on its own feet for the first time in 
a long time. If the rest of the world was 
busy straining further and further from 
what we hope and expect, rock music in 
2004 shifted decisively closer to its poten-
tial: powerful, progressive, and most of all, 
releva nt. 

They've been talking about the "new 
rock" revolution for a long time now: MTV 
started it in the lare '90s with Korn and 
Limp Bizkit, trying to convince a genera-
tion of record-buyers, weaned on the 
incredible mainstream success and godlike 
status of early-'90s grunge bands like Pearl 
J m and Nirvana, that nii-metal represent-
ed a serious breakthrough in rock music. 
Then Spin and the rock press tried again in 
'02 when the White Stripes, the Strokes 

and the Hives hit the big time, proclaiming 
a new world where "rock is fun again," gui-
tar solos are back, and tattered Chuck 
1aylors are still in - just like they were in 
'91. 

Catch was, nobody really bought it: The 
Strokes' Is This It? and the White Stripes' 
Elepbam, both Albums of the Year in their 
time, had much lower sales than those 
grunge hits th,ey so wanted to be. And as for 
nu-metal, no one ever really thought that it 
was nearly as revol utionary as early alt-
rock, despite Carson Daly's smiling insis-
tence. 

But after 2004, the argument that truly 
good rock music is having mainstream suc-
cess doesn 't seem so implausible. A look at 
the bands topping critics' year-end lists will 
reveal that they're the same bands topping 
sales lists for their categories - as well as in 
the all-too-important Top 40. They're also 
the ones earning Grammy nominations -
a dead-sure sign that the Establishment has 
caught on. 

That fabulous foursome of Modest 
Mouse, the Walkmen, Interpol and Franz 
Ferdinand exuded a ubiquitous presence on 
plasticky pop radio and gleaming big-box 

See ROCK 1004. Page 9 

"Shaun of the Dead" showed that not only 
could one seek comfOrt in a pint at the pub, 
but it also makes for a good hiding place if 
you're running away from wmbies. 

Epics made a big comeback this year 
with movies such as "Troy" and 
"Alexander." Both of which, however, were 
disappointing to say the least. One might 
describe "Troy" as an opportunity to see 
Brad bronzed and prancing around, but 
other than the obvious aesthetic value of 
"Troy," the movie was a Trojan horse in its 
own right. And if Americans couldn't get 
enough of the Greeks, there was also 
"Alexander" - with a different bronzed 
actor prancing around, this time an 
Irishman playing a Macedonian ... go fig-
ure. 

One of 2004's "It" girls, Lindsay Lohan, 
owes' much of her rise to stardom to the 
witty comedy "Mean Girls." Garnering 
much praise from critics across the board, 
TIna Fey of "Saturday Night Live" man-
aged to capture the cattiness of high school. 
And of course the target of any mean girl is 
the dork, as was the case in "Napoleon 
Dynamite." If there's one lesson to be 
learned from this film, it is to not underes-
timate that socially awkward kid with the 
ginger hair, squinty eyes, boots and dance 
skills - he's up to something. 

2004 was also a year of seque.ls, and 
surprisingly, they mostly lived up to their 

predecessors. After much, much, much 
bloodshed and an unbearably 

long wait, Tarantino fans 
returned to thea tres 

in March to watch 
Uma finally kill 

Bill. And 

wait? Definitely. Also returning to 
screens in 2004 were a loveable green 
ogre with his verbally incontinent donkey 
sidekick, and the boy who liked to dress 
in red and blue spandex and swing from 
buildings. 

Taking a step away from fiction , docu-
mentaries were suddenly the cool thing to 
watch. Michael Moore, author of Nrw York 
Times bestseller "Stupid White Men," put 
together one of the year's most-talked-about 
docu-films. In typical Moore style, the 
polemic "Fahrenheit 9/\\" lashes out at 
President George W. Bush and his adminis-
tration and had audiences across the country 
booing, jeering, cheering and crying. Who 
would have thought that the chubby guy 
from Michigan could win the Palme d'Or? 
Clearly the approval of the Cannes Film 
Festival jury was not enough; Moore got his 
shiny trophy and Bush got his second tenn 
in office. Another documentary that had 
audiences squirming in their seats was 
"Super Size Me." Who could look at a Big 
Mac in the same way after watching Morgan 
Spurlock throw up his dinner~ 

Award season is fast approaching, and 
rumors are beginning to surface. The big-
gies of 2004, such as "Ray," "Kinsey" "The 
Motorcycle Diaries," "Eternal Sunshine of 
the Spotless Mind," "The Aviator" and 
"Sideways" - which was adapted from the 
novel by UCSD alumnus Rex Pickett - all 
look to be possible contenders in the race 
for the big awards. 

So what can I say about 2004? It was an 
interesting year for movies, to say the least 
- but it was films such as "Napoleon 
Dynamite," "The Motorcycle Diaries," 

"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless 
Mind" and "Garden State" that, 
like the Bride in "Kill Bill ," 
roared and rampaged their way 
to become my personal favorites 
of 2004. Here's hoping that 2005 
is just as entertaining. 

Urban sounds disappoint, but sell

The year in rap, hip-hop and R&B? Usually I'd complain about lumping Talib Kweli and Destiny's Child into 
one category, but it wasn't exacdy a prolific 
year for hlp-hop, so well make do ... 

The big Story of the year was Usher, but 
since you're all as sick of Usher as I am, I'll 
just pretend Cunfwions actually came out in 
2003 and that I can't hear "Yeah!" right now 
blasting out of some distant Applebee's. 

The sales season started with a plop as 
Janet Jackson's over-hyped new album was 
exposed to the masses only to be found fair-
ly uninteresting under scrutiny. The back-
lash was harsh; Janet was banned from 
radio. Oh, and didn't she perform at the 
Super Bowl? 

The world of R&B, or what's left of it, 
wasn't nearly as pervasive a.~ in previous 
years. R. Kelly, whose continuing success 
reminds us that sex with children is OK (as 
long as they're female) released both a dull 
double disc and another widely ignored 
Jay-Z compilation. For his part, Jay-Z did a 
shitty job of being retired, scoring two 
more hits off of The BIiKIt Album before 
recording and touring with R. Kelly (and 

eventually macing Kelly's crew). 
In October, Beyond! & Co. released a 

new album. Listening to the new Destiny's 
Child album is like diving into a swimming 
pool of chocolate pudding only to find it's 
actually carob tapioca: sweet and sticky, but 
what's the point? The jury's still out on the 
lead single, though we can all agree the first 
10 seconds make the hair on our toes prick 
up. The video is equally debatable: a dance-' 
off with yourself in an alley, Beyonce? 
Didn't Usher already do that? And why 
aren't Usher and Beyond! sleeping togeth-
er? Think of the grainy homemade porn 
possibilities. 

If you happened to say last year that 
Eminem was so big he could make a hit 
record out of himself farring, you've been 
delivered proof this year. Over 4 million 
Americans have now shelled out the 20 
bucks to hear Eminem pretend to take a 
crap. The worst part is, of all those who 
called it shitty, half of us still have it in our 
car CD changer. If Eminem were dead, 
he'd be laughing in his grave. 

Led by its premamrely self-proclaimed 
"king" Lit' Jon, crunk continued its slow 
but steady spread toward total media dom-

Rock 2004: Scots' hit debut and Modest 
Mouse's single make for memorable year 

continued from page 8 
store shelves, earning a place right next to 
sure-sellers U2 and Eminem. And guess what? 
All those bands put out exceedingly good 
records, apparendy lush with crossover poten-
tial while at the same 
time satisfying their 
core fan base instead 
of alienating it (still 
what usually happens 
when an indie band 
earns sudden main-
stream success). 
Despite the fact that 
Modest Mouse's 
"Float On" was the 
real feel-good hit of 
the summer, and the 
Walkmen made it all 
the way to the most 
expensive real esta te 
in mainstreamville, 
Fox's superpopular 
"The OC," the snob-

tet spent 2004 discovering, is a kind of across-
the-hoard success that even the wild-eyed 
British music press couldn't imagine. "Take 
Me Out," the album's first single, could be 
heard blasting out of both Urban Outfitters 

by and success-hating Serious success: Modest Mouse 'Nent from indie 

and your local hipster 
record shop. How did 
these pasty Scots 
achieve mainstream 
success and stay cool? 
Easy: They made 
people want to dance. 
Franz Ferdi1lllnd 
grooves from begin-
ning to end like a '90s 
Brit-pop bible trans-
lated into Technicolor 
disco. Vocalist Alex 
Kapranos waxes an 
apocalyptically 
mechanical mix of 
destructive and sexy 
over his band's bass-
thumping shakedown 
in a true postrnodern 
rock orgy. indie kids for whom legends to pop misfits in 2004 with "Roat On.' 

those bands started 
playing didn't tear the buttons off their hood-
ed sweatshirts and screanl "sellout" - they 
welcomed their heroes' music finding main-
stream success. 

It's a great story: A legendary i ndie rock 
band splinters when its original drummer suf-
fers a mental breakdown and quits. The weirdo 
drunkard frontman brings his mates to 
Mississippi to record their second major-label 
album. The album is released to acclaim. Its 
first single, a swirling, triumphant march that 
promises "don't you worry, we'll all Boat on" 
becomes a huge summer hit, reintroducing 
rock to the pop radio mainstream. Then, of 
course, the album goes platinum. That's what 
happened to Modest Mouse this year, and 
that's why they are indisputably the biggest 
band of the year. 

__ Few rock bands ever make an album where 
every song is genuinely a winner, but Franz 
Ferdinand managed to do it their very first 
time. The prire for that, as the Sconish quar-

While the Strokes' 
second album kept the greasy darlings' sound 
pretty much the same as their debut, New York 
brethren Interpol took a new direction with 
Antics - and it was the right one. By replacing 
pale solemnity with heartfelt life, Interpol 
found real mainstream success. But it wasn't 
the only New York band to make it big this 
year. The Walkmen, a blazer-and-slacks kind 
of rock group &om th.at same great city, turned 
out a fast, snare-pounding single called "The 
Rat," and rode it all the way to the top. Who 
cares if they're the Coldplay of indie rock? 

Wait a minute . The Walkmen (and all 
these bands for that matter) are no longer 
indie at all . We'll have to just call it rock -
and finally that will mean something good . 
(Except, uh, when we talk about U2 . 
Rolling Stone lazily called them Band of 
the Year, but didn't say whether they earned 
that with the ugly iPod or the boring 
album. Guess what guys : 2004 belonged to 
a younger generation.)

one spot for each of the five weeks 
Usher wasn't there. Time will tell if 
all the masses of Southern rappers 
who scored a crunk hit this year will 
have any staying power. 

Hip-hop fans might have had a 
hard spring, but some relief did 
come. Both Mos Def and Talib 
Kweli released new albums this year 
- to mixed reviews. Fans were 
probably a little disappointed on 
both counts, though most will be 
slow to admit it. Leave it to the 
Roots, who have a good six years on 
the Black Star boys, to release the 
best hip-hop album of the year, The 
Tipping Point. All might have been 
bested in the lyrics deparonent by a 
surprisingly good Nas double albwn, 
although it looks too late to truly 
revive his career; Srreez's Oisdple has 
already plummeted out of the top 50, 
Nas may be following fiancee Kelis 
into rapid obscurity. Vaulting into 
the scene with the same speed came 
Kanye West, who scored critical 
acclaim and even collUTIercial success 
with his debut album. College Dropout 
earned West an impressive 10 
Granuny nominations and the cov-
eted role of one of the best hip-hop 
producers of the yea r. Ten might 
seem a tad excessive, but who else 
was getting them ... Li I' Jon? 

Nelly'S Sweat/S1/it album pair 
rocked more junior high dances 
than clubs this year, thanks to the 
huge success of the cuddly Tim 
McGraw duet "Over and Over." 
Surprised by the success, country 
and rap artists scrambled to team up 
and capitalize on the new trend. 
Look for the 50 CentlFaith Hill 
duet "I'm Gonna Fuck You Like a 
Butterfly," coming soon.

The San Diego Museum of Art now has an extensive contem-porary East Asian art exhi bit: 
"Past in Reverse: Contemporary 
Art of East Asia." Curated by 
Betti-Sue Hem, the exhibit fea-
tures a blend of works by 22 differ-
ent artists from five different 
countries. 

A wide variety of pieces are 
presented by the exhibit's artists, 
within the frame of responses to 
recent economic and social trends 
in the area. "Past in Reverse" 
blends the young with the old, the 
traditional with the hype and the 
classical with the contemporary in 
a flawless way, providing a pleasant 
and colorful walkthrough even 
before exploring thoroughly. 

"Past in Reverse" brings 
together the more established 
artists of the region with the up-
and-coming artists, under the 
framework of responses to change. 
Artists such as Wang Qingsong, 
who has presented work in the 
U nited States a couple of times 
before, accompany artists who are 
displaying work for the first time. 

Wilson Shieh, an artist from 
Hong Kong, expresses himself 
with a language of antiquity: the 
gongbi tradition, fine brush figura-
tive painting. His unorthodox sub-
jects portray the moving social and 
political relations in his environ-
ment. Shieh's "Musical 
Instruments Series (199912004)" 
embodies male and female figures 
that play eachother as they are 
transformed into musical instru-
ments. Homosexual and hetero-
sexual distinctions are eliminated, 
and emphasis is placed upon the 
fragility of the communication 
process and the beauty of the rela-
tionship. 

Michael Lin works with over-
size versions of traditional 
Taiwanese domestic art figures, 
installing them into architectural 
spaces to alter their traditional 
order. In one work, Lin applies 
bedspread patterns to the fl oor 
with enlarged flower motifs and 
cushions where people can relax, 
inverting the artwork-viewer rela-
tionship. 

"Past in Reverse : 
Contemporary Art of East Asia" 
will be displayed at the San Diego 
Museum of Art until March 6. 

www.aeonet.com 

Also look forward to some good 
music from Dr. Dre, some poten-
tially good music from 50 Cent, 
some shitty music from Jennifer 
Lopez, and a big comeback from 
]ay-Z. For now, put that Eminem 
CD back on (nobody can hear you) 
and pray for better things in 2005.

The 9 best albums of 2004 
iPort 
on random 

Ian S. Port 

My nine favorite albums of the . year, in no particular order: Modest Mouse Good 
News For People Who Like Bad 
News 

You've heard enough about 
"Float On." The best song on the 
rock album of the year is "Black 
Cadillacs." Isaac Brock's voice bears 
an eerie whisper as he pleads the 
opening lines: "And it's true we 
named our children! After towns 
that we'd never been to! And it's 
true that the clouds just hung 
around! Like black Cadillacs out-
side of a funeraL" Then Brock and 
Co. explode in sarcastic reproach, 
letting the madmen inside seep out, 
just as they're prone to do. "Black 
Cadillacs" moves between sarcastic 
anger and lucid calm: the results of 
either fighting through a negative 
view of life or learning to love it 
despite its absurdity. Brocks opti-
mism is hard-won (his band's dri-
ven a hell of a rough road in its long 
history) and I trust it. America may 
have chosen the wrong president, 
but we chose the right rock album. 

Interpol Antics 
Underneath Interpol 's vivid 

aonospherics and intricate instru-
mental interplay, Antics is really the 
cheesy love song album of the year. 
It's as if Paul Banks knew his band 
was. good enough instrumentally 
that he could get away with shoot-
me-in-the-face lyrics like, "Let me 
celebrate the myriad ways in which 
I love you." But he was right; the 
fact that his lyrics are so corny only 
adds to the overall impression of the 
thing. Because the album is so com-
plete a statement, so riveting and 
musically rich and yet so unselfcon-
sc ious and lyri cally intimate, it 
overcomes you, almost involuntari-
ly. A hundred bands are as musical-
ly imposing as Interpol ; another 
hundred as arresting lyrica lly -
bur very, very few others are both. 

The Arcade Fire Funeral 
If Modest Mouse proved in 

2004 that honest-to-god indie rock 
could have mainstream success, the 
Arcade Fire's Funeral proved that 
that genre's best was still far from it. 
Win Butler and his band give mis-
ery a good name on Funel·a/, which 
somehow both wallows in and tran-
scends the death of three of the 
bandillember's relatives. Over grit-
ty guitars and a strangely 19th-ce n-
tury atmosphere, Butler wails 
through stories about maturity, 
heartbreak and, of course, death. If 
it sounds overwhelmingly negative 
(and how could it not), hold your 
judgment: Butler's band answers 
sorrow with t'"iumph, balancing his 
despairingly hopeful lyrics with 
grand, even dancey, instrumental 
rock heights, as ener6"eric and 
inspiring as death is finaL 

Franz Ferdinand Fran,z 
Ferdinand 

Eleven songs, none of which are 
disappointing. 

The Fiery Furnaces Blueberry 
Boat 

The most fun album I heard this 
year is also the weirdest. Eleanor 
and David Freidburger take the 
psycho-journey-blues feel of the 
group 's original album and fl esh it 
out in tO a full-on ) , a opera, like 
Richard Henry Dana's "Two Years 
Before The Mast" if Lou Reed was 
ca ptain . The Furnaces ramble, both 
lyrically and musi ca lly, but the 
imposing size of Bhuberry Boat -
12 tracks of continuous, absurd 
narrative - is countered by the fact 
that something new happens every 
damn second, and you've probably 
never heard anything like it. A 
fuzzy wah-wah guitar runs circles 
around a rolling piano, building to 
a march that's saturated the Qext 
second by a rich organ just before 

the whole thing falls back into a 
Stones-y rock moment - all while 
Eleanor sings crazy lines like 
"Mocked up with si lk strings and 
taffeta tricked! With nails out of 
driftwood already iron sicked! Now 
spy out the glass at whatever mis-
steps mel And the press gang's war-
rant signed Sir Edward Pepsi." It 
could have been boring and self-
consciously any, but the psychedel -
ic swashbuckler motif fits perfectly. 

Les Savy F av Incbes 
A set of nine two-song EPs 

compiled into a classic post-punk 
full-length? A riotous band of 
musical misfits, famously fronted 
by a fat, bearded and vertically 
challenged Satan look-alilce? Les 
Savy Fav finally captured the noto-
rious intensity of their live perfor-
mance on tape, and this incredible 
collection is the result. Working 
chronologically backwards, Inches 
begins with Les Savy Fav's more 
contained recent work and devolves 
into a violent ruckus from there. 
They channel old Joy Division, 
snag the Gang of Four throne and 
beat the Liars with sharp, minimal-
ist precision. This is our punk. 

TV on the Radio Desperate 
~utb, Tbinty &hes 

TV on the Radio made the most 
radical statement in pop music this 
year. D~e,.alt Ytmth sounds like 
nothing else: Gigantic, pulsating 
bass is the most dominant accom-
paniment to Tunde Adebimpe's 
soulful wail. Building songs like 
this, with guitar and drums adding 
peripheral spice to high vocals and 
a low, loud rumble, melting into 
hooks instead of stepping into 
them, TV on the Radio create a 
radical new instrumental aesthetic 
while bringing more traditional, 
virtuosic vocals bade to rock music. 
It's far from perfect, especially near 
the end, but TV on the Radio's first 
full length is the most revolution-
ary artistic statement in pop music 
tllis year. 

The Streets A Grand Don't 
Come For Free 

Mike Skinner is a freaking 
weirdo. His whol e new album 
seems to be about his cell phone 
running out of batteries, some girl 
playing with her hair in a bar, or 
some other equally insignificant 
detail of life. But Skinner's made a 
fantastic hip-hop concept record 
with a story that's really about find-
ing our how much the little things 
in life can set you back if you don't 
appreciate and hang on to them. 
Skinner blasts exhaustively 
detailed, awkwardly Briti.sh rhymes 
over his trademark choppy cheese 
beats, which stagger dry drum 
sounds around samples of every-
thing from Wagner to cheesy '80s 
adult-pop. Sort of like Eminem -
the pasty Skinner often slant-
rhymes over extremely sparse beats 
- except his stories are about 
learning to deal with life, instead of 
lashing out at those who gave it. 

Comets on Fire Blue 
Catbedral 

Comets on Fire are my kind of 
geniuses. They smoke a lot of 
weed, play music because they want 
to (rather than because they get 
paid to) and turn out brillian t, psy-
chedelic-rock masterpieces like 
Blue Cathedral. C omets on Fire 
write songs by turning everything 
- including a crazy, space-noise-
inducing ar ti fact from the '60s 
called an Echoplex - to the high -
est volume, and letting that shit 
wail. The eight almost completely 
instrumental tracks on their latest 
album br; .; t!e with bulgy stoner-
rock powerchording and tease out 
into moments of transcendent, 
trippy serenity. Voca li st Ethan 
Miller cOllUTIits some franti c (and 
vague) howling to a few tracks, but 
Comets on Fire prefer to let their 
instruments speak, through impro-
vised jams that explore every 
nuance of the rhythm and chord 
progression. This is bebop for the 
Nirvana generation, and, for the 
record , my favorite album of 2004 .

14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Tritons: Halran, Bell, Levy help carry team 
continued from page 16 

added 0.08 seconds to her morning 
time while dropping to seventh 
place. Delurgio's fourth-place, 
23.97 -second prelims finish did not 
carry over into the finals heat, 
despite dropping an additional 0.13 
seconds between the two races. In 
the finals, UC Irvine's Chealsea 

agata and Oregon State's Brie 
Marhenke, who were seeded fifth 
and sixth in prelims, respectively, 
each climbed past Delurgio in the 
finals to take fourth and fifth place. 
Only 0.57 seconds divided 
Delurgio's pace from the event win-
ner, Stanford freshman Brooke 
Bishop, who finished in 23.27 sec-
onds. 

In addition to earning an 
CM "An qualifying time in the 

50 free, Harl an's fourth-place fin-
ish in the 100 free in a ti me of 

52.13 seconds was only 0.52 sec-
onds behind Oregon State's first-
place Kristin HustOn and easily 
passed for her second "A" qualify-
ing time of the meet. Topping off 
her performance, she garnered a 
"B" qualifying time in the 1 00 
backstroke, which she negative 
split, going out in 30.05 seconds 
and returning on the back half of 
the race in 29.71 to combine for a 
59.76. She also managed another 
"B" qualifying time in the 200 free 
for her 13th-place, 1:55.0 finish. 

Sophomore Susan Bell swam 
one of the most overall dominant 
meets for the Tritons, combining 
for NCAA "An qualifying times in 
the 100 backstroke, 200 breast-
stroke, 200 individual medley, 400 
individual medley and 500 freestyle, 
plus CAA "B" qualifying times in 
the 1 00 breaststroke and the 200 

backstroke. 
Junior Sophie Levy led Triton 

distance swimmers with three 
NCM "An qualifying times in the 
200, 500 and 1,650 free events. In 
the 200 free, she turned in a time of 
1:53.78 to secure a sixth-place finish 
in the finals heat, dominated by 
Stanford swimmers who took first, 
third, fourth and fifth places in the 
event. In the 500 free, Levy swam a 
5:03 .41 in the preliminary heat, giv-
ing her a 13 th seed for finals; how-
ever, in a frustrating turn of events, 
she added time in the afternoon 
race, turning in a 5:05.26 for a 16th-
place finish. 

Each of UCSD's relays were 
successful, hitting NCAA "A" qual -
ifying times with a 1 :47. 14 in the 
200 medley, a 3:52.22 in the 400 
medley, a I :34.80 in the 400 free 
and a 7:38.45 in the 800 free.

Swimming: Eleven Tritons 
qualify fqr NCAA Nationals 

continued from page 16 
the career top-10 at UCSD, 
including Spicer's 500 free, senior 
Michael Baier's . 200 individual 
medley time of 1:5 2 .65 and fresh-
man Derek Pettit's 4:05 .63 in the 
400 individual medley. 

As if the individual successes of 
the Speedo Cup were not enough, 
three UCSD relays achieved 
NCAA "A" qualifying times, 
including the 200 medley relay, the 
400 medley relay, which finished in 
3:22 .24; and the third-place 800 
free relay, in its time of 6:50.33 . 

In dual meet action on Jan. 2, 
the Tritons fell to the Washington 
Huskies at Canyon view Pool in a 
151.50-105.50 decision . 

Despite strong showings from 
UCSD athletes, the Huskies won 
all but four individual events, sub-
mitting to Boehm's dominance in 
the 200 free, 200 fly and 200 indi-
vidual medley, then to Going, who 
captured victory in the 100 breast 
with a time of 59.09 seconds. 

The Tritons took charge in the 
200 free relay with a I :26.04 finish, 
thanks to fast performances by 
Harutunian, senior Mark Tate and 
sophomore Tim Fuller. 

Fuller also took second place in 
the 50 free in a time of 21.78. 

The Tritons return to the pool 
to host their final dual home meet 
of the 2004-05 season at noon on 
Jan. 16 against UC Davis.

playing time," Finegold said . 
"Next year we want to win con-
ference and do as well as we can 
at [the NCAA tournament)." . 

Eichholz tied freshman dri-
ver AdnanJerkovic for the most 
goals scored during the 2004 
season with 48, and was named 
a member of the AlI-WWPA 
First Team. 

Coming off the bench during 
his sophomore season, Eichholz 
was credited with 12 goals. 

"The experience has helped 
a lot," Eichholz said. "I feel a lot 
more comfortable in the water, 
and with my whole game 
awareness. " 

Prior to playing for UCSD, 
the Las Vegas native got his start 
in the pool as a swimmer. 

"I swam competitively from 
when 1 was about seven till I was 
12," Eichholz said. "Then the 
mom of one of the guys on the 
team met our club coach. We 
were the only club water polo 
team in Vegas." 

Before redshirting with the 
Tritons in his first year at 
UCSD, Eichholz played a sea-
son under head coach Brian 
Harvey at Grossmont College 
in San Diego. 

Reflecting on the 2004 sea-
son, which ended sourly in a dev-
astating quarrer-final loss at the 
WWPA Championships to 
Redlands, Eichholz's sentiments 
are predictable. 

"It was disappointing," he 
said "It was a really good season, 
and there was more to the season 
than the end." 

Great Part-Time income!

No.2 UCSD silences D,I and D,II competition in Long Beach 
Boehm smashes five school records, including four individual events and a relay 
By MAnHEW GRANT 

Sports Editor 

Following overall outstanding 
performances at the Nov. 13 dual 
home meet agai nst Cal tate San 
Bernardino and the ov. 18 to 

ov. 20 Speedo Cup at Belmont 
Plaza in Long Beach, Calif. , the 
Triton men's swim and dive team 
is ranked o . 2 in the 
Coll egeSwi mming.com national 
coaches poll. Eleven of the team's 
athletes have secured NCAA "A" 
qualifying times and an additional 
seven have achieved NCAA "B" 
quali fyi ng times. 

UCSD senior Kurt Boehm was 
named atio nal Collegiate 
Swimmer of the Week on Nov. 29 
fo llowlIlg his showing at the 
Speedo Cup, in which he not only 
notched four NCAA "A" qualifying 
times, but also set four individual 
chool records, as well as taking 

pa rt in the CSD record-breaking, 
econd-pl ace 400-medley re lay. 

T he recipient of the honor is nom-
inated by coaches, sports informa-
lion directors and conference rep-
resentatives, then finally selected 
by a panel of collegiate coaches 
from 10 of the best swimming pro-
grams in the country. 

The Division II Triton men 
si lenced their competition follow-
ing a second-place overall finish 
behind Stanford at the peedo 
Cup. The field, composed of virtu-
ally all Division I teams, could not 
keep lip with the 11 individual 
Triton racers who posted NCAA 
"A" qualifying times. 

Leading the charge, Boehm 
beat second-place Stanford racer 
Matt McDonald by more than a 

quarter of a second in the 100-yard 
butterfly, with a time of 48 .64 sec-
onds, to capture the first of his four 
"A" qualifying times in a field of 56 
s\vimmers. In the event, Boehm 
stole Mark Latronica 's 2000 school 
record of 48.78 seconds. 

Boehm went on to win the 200-
fly by more than two fuji seconds in 
a time of 1 :49.07, beating BYU's 
Dougie Broadbent's second-place 
1:51.11, and toppling a 38-com-
petitor field . The 19-year-old 
school record that Boehm sur-
passed in the event was set in 1986 
by Roger Brisbane 's time of 
1:49.81. 

Boehm entered the 200 individ-
ual medley final heat following a 
fourth-place preliminary race in a 
time of 1 :51.82, but he disappoint-
ed the field by dropping more than 
two-and-a-half seconds in the finals 
heat to a 1 :49.24, capturing second 
place to Stanford's Hongzhe Sun. 
T he finish terminated Travis 
Miller's 1993 record time of 
1:50.93 . 

In the 400 individual medley, 
Boehm did not compete in the 
final heat; his preliminary time 
would have seeded him in third 
position for the finals and could 
have earned a fourth-place finish 
had he not improved in the second 
race. Nonetheless, his time of 
3:57 .95 was strong enough to 
merit an NCAA "A" qualifying 
time. 

Boehm's superior performance 
was capped by his leg of the UCSD 
record-setting, 400 medley "A" 
relay, in which he and teammates 
senior Brett Going and sopho-
mores Mike Lahey and Andrew 
Harutunian took second to the 

Andrew Mo/Guardian 
Fly by: Senior Michael Baie(s time of 1 :52.65 in the 200 individual medley was among the top-10 finishes In Triton history. 
Stanford "A" relay in a time of 
3:22 .24, edging the third-place 
BYU "A" relay by 0.83 seconds. 

Triton distance swimmers 
demonstrated that they will be a 
challenge for anyone at the NCAA 
Division II Championships. Senior 
Devin Spicer and sophomore Joel 
TourtelJotte took fifth and sixth 
places in the 1,650 freestyle, a sin-
gle body-length apart with their 
respective times of 15 :57.01 and 
15:58.24. Both times satisfy NCAA 
"A" requisites. 

Spicer also posted an "A" qual i-

fying time in his eighth-place, 500 
free finish in a time of 4:36.17, 
coming off of a 4:32 .93 preliminary 
time. 

Harutunian presented the 
Tritons with some of the fastest 
freestyle sprints and splits of his 
season, including a spectacular 
20.09-second anchor split in the 
fourth-place, 200 medley relay. In 
the 50 free, he qualified in 21.32 
seconds, then came back for finals 
in a 12th-place, 23.93-second fin -
ish. Although Harutuni3J1 did not 
enter the finals heat of the 100 free 

sprint, his qualifying time of 46.46 
would have secured an eighth-
place finish out of the 86- competi-
tor field . His 14th-place finish in 
the 100 fly in 51.3 3 seconds guar-
antees that he will remain a fierce 
challenge through the end of the 
regular season and beyond. All 
three of Harutunian's finishes met 
NCAA "B" qualifying times. 

Boehm aside, three other ath-
letes on the Triton men's team 
posted times that landed them into

tle for fourth place between the 
Tritons, UC Irvine and BYU. The 
Anteaters ultimately won after edg-
ing the Tritons by 22 points, 702-
680. UCSD pulled together for 12 
NCAA "A" qualifying times at the 
meet. 

Delurgio beat her second-place 
counterpart in the 200 breast event 
by more than a fuji second, edging 
Nevadas Stephanie Gabert in a 
time of 2 minutes, 16.2 seconds to 
2:16.38. Delurgio was seeded third 
behind first-seed Gabert after com-
ing in more than two-and-a-half 
seconds back in the preliminary 
heat, setting herself up for the upset 
victory. 

In the 100 breast event, 
Delurgio finished second to 
Stanford's Caroline Bruce, with 
times of 1:01.75 and 1:03.45, 
respectively. T he two athletes were 
nearly deadlocked in the prelimi-
nary heat of the event, finishing the 
qualifying round separated by bare-
ly 0.3 seconds, 1 :03 .63 and 1 :03 .94, 
as Bruce hung on to earn the top 
seed. Even though Delurgio 
dropped almost a half second in the 
finals, Bruce shaved almost two full 
seconds from her time for the vic-
tory. 

Delurgio and sophomore Emily 
Harlan placed sixth and seventh, 
respectively, in the 50 free. Harlan 
charged through the preliminary 
heat to a second-place finsh behind 
Stanford's Lacey Boutwell in a time 
of 23.78 seconds. Harlan was 
unable to return with such intensity 
for the afternoon finals heat and
