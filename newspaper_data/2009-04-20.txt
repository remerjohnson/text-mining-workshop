One of the newest trademarks 
of John Muir College closed shop 
during spring break, moving from 
UCSD premises to Garnet Avenue in 
Pacific Beach.

Since opening in August 2005, 
Muir Surf and Skate thrived in its 
location across from El Mercado 
and Redwood Lounge. Because of 
its close proximity to the renowned 
Black’s Beach, it was a first stop for 
surfers and skaters alike in meeting 

all equipment needs. 
However, when UCSD Recreation 

Outback Adventures announced it 
would be opening its surf shop on 
campus April 24, Muir Surf and 
Skate manager Scott Lembach said 
he was compelled to relocate.

“It wasn’t our initial intent to 
move,” Lembach said. “But we can-
not compete against a large organi-
zation such as Outback Adventures.”

Though Outback Adventures 
has been providing gear for outdoor 
sporting adventures since 1978, its 
interests never conflicted with the 
smaller surf and skate shop until 
the creation of Outback Adventures 
Surf Shop.

Set in the more central Price 
Center, Outback Adventures Surf 
Shop is expected to attract a lot 
more attention and customers than 
Muir Surf and Skate did in its iso-

lated location. 
“Moving to Pacific Beach opened 

a realm of new changes,” Lembach 
said. “The new location is signifi-

cantly bigger, has more merchan-
dise, and for the first time, is in the

Though he tasted success with the 
unanimous passage of his preliminary 
student-organization funding legisla-
tion on April 8, Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Naasir Lakhani 
looked anything but triumphant at last 
Wednesday’s A.S. Council meeting, 
when the second half of his proposal 
sparked debate between councilmem-
bers before eventually being dismissed 
as “unfinished business.”

Lakhani called for the establish-
ment of a student-organization fund-
ing advisory board, comprised of 11 
students who would oversee all fund-
ing requests. These students would 
ultimately be appointed by a com-
mittee made up 
of the associ-
ate vice presi-
dent of student 
organizations, 
vice president 
of finance and 
resources and 
four A.S. sena-
tors.

At the sug-
gestion of 
Revelle College 
Senator Katie 
Hall, a sub-
committee was 
formed to dis-
cuss which stu-
dents should be 
appointed to the 
advisory board. 
According to 
Lakhani, who 
is serving on 
the committee, 
they decided 
yesterday to rec-
ommend that the funding board be 
headed by the AVP of student orga-
nizations and composed of seven A.S. 
senators.

Lakhani had originally intended 
for the board to be composed of stu-
dent appointees. However, this pro-
posal drew opposition from Associate 
Vice President of Academic Affairs 
Lana Blank, who argued that it is 
unrealistic to place students on the 
advisory board and expect them to 
understand the council’s funding pro-

The San Diego Police Department 
released a statement last week warn-
ing the public about a string of simi-
lar crimes in which a man grabbed 
women and exposed himself in the 
University Towne Center area.

A total of 10 incidents have been 
reported since May 2008 involving a 
male suspect approaching a woman, 
touching her buttocks or crotch 
area and/or exposing himself, then 
fleeing the scene. Six of the cases 
occurred within the last month.

The suspect is described as a 
clean-shaven Latino or Middle 
Eastern male between the age of 20 
and 25, standing at 5 feet 4 inches 
to 5 feet 10 inches with a thin build, 
short, dark hair and a medium to 
dark complexion. He is usually seen 
wearing dark pants and a hooded 
sweatshirt.

In light of these incidents, SDPD 
advises members of the public to 
walk and exercise in groups, park in 
well-lit areas, avoid cell-phone use 
on the way to their cars and report 
individuals who loiter around areas 
for no apparent purpose.

Anyone with information regard-
ing these or other attacks is asked to 
contact either the SDPD Northern 
Division at (858) 552-1700 or Crime 
Stoppers at (888) 580-8477 or 
sdcrimestoppers.com.

Under proposed 
legislation, 11-student 
advisory board would 
oversee all student-org 
funding requests. 

There’s a lot about the Grove Caffe that wor-ries the A.S. Council.Most concerning is the roughly $126,000 
of debt that hovers over the cafe, 
roughly $80,000 of which has accu-
mulated over the last two years 
alone.

Accordingly, the few council-
members aware of the Grove’s pre-
dicament are pushing to shut down 
the longtime campus landmark 
once and for all, cutting their losses 
and paying off the debt with funds 
generated by other A.S. enterprises.

The council’s final vote on the 
fate of the Grove is set to take place 
this Wednesday. 

Last year the council decided to 
review the Grove’s financial perfor-
mance, using this year as an evalu-
ation period. After witnessing con-
tinued losses throughout the last 
two quarters, A.S. President Donna 
Bean is about ready to jump ship.

“We’re pouring student fees into 
the Grove right now,” Bean said. 

“It’s over $120,000 in debt. If we 
continue to run the Grove then 
we’re basically subsidizing it.”

Yet others still see hope for the 
beleaguered enterprise. The Grove’s 
employees, led by student managers

Thomas Frank and Autumn Hays, are 
in the process of devising a new busi-
ness model for the Grove, which they 
intend to present before the council 
at this Wednesday’s meeting. They 
want to sell fewer espresso drinks 
and more food, escaping the now-
saturated campus coffee market and 
attempting to carve out a new niche 
by offering a variety of hot sand-
wiches and pizza.

They also said they want the 
Grove to stay open for a shorter 
period throughout the year, closing in 
the summer and over campus breaks 
when fewer customers are around.

Additionally, Frank and Hays said 
that manager Cleveland Thomas — 
hired by the council in the summer 
of 2007 in an effort to revive the fail-
ing business — informed them that 
he wouldn’t be returning next year. 
Thomas’ departure would mean the 
removal of his $50,000 annual salary 
from the Grove’s expenses. 

But it might not be enough.“I’m torn because while it’s a great place and it serves a lot 
of students, we can’t just fall further 
and further into debt,” Associate Vice 
President of Enterprise Operations 
Chelsea Maxwell said. “Ideally I 
would love to do something where it 
could stay open, but I just don’t know 
if A.S. has the means.”

Since September 2008, the Grove’s 
profits have been marginal at best, 
fluctuating month-to-month. Most 
recently, the cafe reported a profit 
of just under $200 for the month of 
February. 

It then lost over $7,000 in March.
According to Vice President 

of Finance and Resources Naasir 
Lakhani, these inconsistencies are 
explained by a simple formula: The 
Grove loses money when students 
go on vacation and makes money 
when students are around. This past 
summer, the cafe remained open 
and lost over $14,000; in December 
and January, when students left cam-
pus for winter break, it lost nearly 
$11,000.

November and March, which saw 
losses of $6,000 and $7,000 respec-
tively, remain something of an anom-
aly, Lakhani said.

The Grove’s financial troubles extend far into its long history at UCSD.
When it opened in the mid-1980s, 

the Grove existed as a part of the 

Crafts Center. The wood patio that 
still surrounds the cafe was con-
structed by Crafts Center Director 
Ron Carlson, who also planted the 
trees and shrubbery that adorn the 
Grove’s planked walkways.

Carlson ran the Grove for sev-
eral years, gradually ceding the reigns 
of management to the cafe’s student 
employees. Things didn’t always go 
smoothly. Every 
few years, busi-
ness went sour and 
profits dipped into 
the red, prompting 
Carlson to step in 
and lend his exper-
tise to the students 
in charge.

But in 2007, 
Carlson decided to 
cut loose from the 
failing business — 
at the time over $25,000 in debt — 
and sold his 50 percent share of the 
cafe to the A.S. Council, rendering 
the Grove a fully student-run enter-
prise.

Another year of sinking profits 
forced the council to take action. 
After rejecting the idea of a Grove 
partnership with the Rady School 
of Management, and considering 
shutting the Grove down completely, 
the council hired Thomas, who had 
previously managed campus eater-
ies, with hopes he would bring more 
stable leadership to the cafe.

Now, a year and a half later, things have only gotten worse. Employees initially 
blamed the Grove’s continued accu-

mulation of debt on construction 
work in the Student Center, which 
made the cafe virtually inaccessible 
to students for much of Fall Quarter 
2007. Others attribute these failures 
to the high cost of maintaining a 
nonstudent manager.

“There’s been revenue, but not the 
kind of revenue to sustain that type of 
salary,” Lakhani said.

Bean acknowl-
edged that when 
councilmembers 
hired Thomas, 
they were aware 
that revenue 
would dip with the 
expense of the new 
position. However,  
she said they never 
anticipated that the 
cafe’s debt would 
reach the excessive 

level that it has.
“[The debt] was supposed to hit 

maybe eighty or ninety thousand, 
then peak and turn around,” Bean 
said. “But it hasn’t done that. It’s just 
gone deeper into debt.”

Some former employees have 
been critical of Thomas’ performance 
as manager.

“I didn’t know what Cleveland’s 
role was,” said a former employee of 
the cafe who was let go earlier this 
quarter and who wished to remain 
annonymous. “I saw him there, but I 
didn’t know what he was really there 
for.”

Though Bean, Frank and Hays 
are unwilling to lay the blame on the 
new manager, they acknowledge that 
Thomas has taken a largely hands-off 

approach to managing the cafe over 
the last several months.

“He did pretty much leave a stu-
dent in charge a lot of the time,” Bean 
said.

However, Frank and Hays — who 
have been responsible for running 
most of the Grove’s day-to-day opera-
tions, including the hiring and firing 
of employees — say that Thomas has 
simply been preparing them to take 
over once he leaves in June.

“Cleveland is the guy who is 
always on our backs going ‘no, no, no, 
you’ve got to do it like this,’ and mak-
ing sure all the employees are work-
ing and things like that,” Hays said. 
“Mainly, though, his biggest thing 
has been making sure he gets really 
good management in there and really 
good employees and training them to 
take over.”

Thomas has also been criticized 
by a number of former Grove employ-
ees and customers for his allegedly 
abrupt workplace demeanor.

“I think there were a lot of fac-
tors working against him,” Bean said. 
“But I know some workers person-
ally and there are a lot of students 
and customers who have had bad 
experiences with him. On a personal 
level I don’t think he was the best of 
managers.”

Thomas declined to comment.

I n general, all involved in the Grove’s dilemma agree that its poor performance is mostly a 
result of the lack of foot traffic in 
the area. 

In its glory days, the Grove was 
the only coffee shop at UCSD, and 
was afforded plenty in the way of cus-
tomers — until the Student Center 
began losing much of its business 
to new campus hub Price Center in 
1993.

In addition, there are over 10 cof-
fee shops spread throughout campus, 
with more are on the way. Espresso 
kiosks seem to spring up overnight in 
ever more convenient locations.

“Twenty-four years ago you 
couldn’t get coffee every two steps 
on campus,” Hays said. “We were the 
coffee place, and it was still kind of 
an exotic thing to go and get a cup 
of coffee. But now, every two steps 
there’s a coffee cart. They’re all over 
the place.”

As a result, profits simply aren’t 
what they used to be.

“There’s a focus away from the

Student Center to the Price Center 
expansion and there’s an oversatura-
tion of coffee on our campus right 
now,” Bean said.

Nevertheless, the cafe’s employ-
ees have fought to draw more atten-
tion to the former campus hub. The 
Grove has run an extended guerilla 
marketing campaign over the last 
two quarters, distributing coupons 
on Library Walk and talking up a 
newly revised menu including sand-
wich wraps and breakfast burritos. 
Thomas set up a grill in front of the 
cafe shortly after he was hired, serv-
ing barbequed items like burgers, ribs 
and pork sandwiches in an effort to 
attract more lunchtime business.

“The fact of the matter is that we 
don’t have foot traffic,” Frank said. 
“So what we’ve been working on for 
the last quarter is finding new ways 
of getting that foot traffic. It’s our 
job to physically pull students into 
our shop.”

Despite these efforts, the Grove 
has continued to flounder. The the-
ory that the cafe is still capable of 
turning a profit while students are in 
session — also shared by Maxwell — 
appears defeated by November’s sig-
nificant loss. According to Lakhani, 
March’s $7,000 loss is also surprising, 
despite the fact that finals week and 
spring break fell within that period.

“Before seeing the March num-
bers, I was really wondering, ‘Why 
would we want to shut this place down 
after looking at January and February 
and seeing positive numbers there?’” 
Lakhani said. “But then, after seeing 
March and seeing it lose $7,000, that 
was kind of a big shock to me.”

Grove employees think the council might be able to offer additional assistance rather 
than shut the cafe down completely. 

Frank and Hays have suggested 
moving the popular A.S. Bear Garden 
to the grassy hill near the Student 

Center once a month, and would like 
the Grove to cater the event rather 
than see the council offer the lucrative 
task to an outside vendor like Subway.

“If we catered the Bear Garden, 
[the council] would be paying an A.S. 
enterprise,” Frank said. “They would 
be paying themselves.” 

According to Associate Vice 
President of Programming Garrett 
Berg, however, the likelihood of cre-
ating a Grove-centric Bear Garden is 
extremely slim.

“We looked into the Grove doing 
the food and they just don’t have 
the capability to make enough food 
for a thousand people,” Berg said. 

“In addition, there’s literally not an 
ounce of flat land on the [grassy hill], 
so we wouldn’t be able to do any of 
the things we do [at Bear Gardens], 
like booths, tables, games — any of 
it. It’s also just not big enough for a 
thousand people, whereas Matthews 
Quad is.”

After Thomas’ entrance as man-
ager, the council formed the Grove 
Advisory Committee. Consisting of 
Maxwell, Lakhani, Bean, Thomas and 
Student Center officials, the body is 
designed to oversee the cafe’s finances 
and provide the council with greater 
insight into its operations. 

However, the committee has met 
only a handful of times, and has kept 
any interaction with Grove manage-
ment at an informal level. 

“It’s just really informal,” Maxwell 
said. “It’s not like ‘this is our agenda,’ 

and stuff. It’s just to keep the lines of 
communication open.”

Frank and Hays just met with 
members of the committee for the 
first time earlier this month. It was at 
that meeting that they found out the 
council would be voting on whether to 
shut the cafe down during week five.

Last week, the legislation to close 
the Grove was moved up to this 
Wednesday; neither Frank nor Hays 
were notified of the change in sched-
ule.

“I only recently even knew the 
advisory committee existed,” Hays 
said. “That’s one thing we’re going 
to bring before A.S. We want to have 
more communication with them. 
Until recently, we didn’t even know 
we were supposed to have that kind 
of back-and-forth communication 
with them. We would actually really 
like that, in fact.”

Frank believes some funding from 
the council would go a long way 
toward helping the Grove.

“We never get any funding from 
them,” Frank said. “We’re $0 on their 
budget. So even if we just had $5,000 
a year, I wouldn’t be using a 1968 
freezer that gets us marked off on our 
health inspection every time.”

However, Bean is unwilling to 
put student fees toward the ailing 
business. The council currently has 
enough funds saved up from profits 
generated by A.S. Soft Reserves and 
Lecture Notes to pay off the debt 
accumulated by the Grove if it is 
closed this Wednesday. 

Whether the Grove shuts its doors 
for good will depend largely on how 
well its student employees are able to 
convince councilmembers that the 
cafe still has a shot at making a come-
back. They’ll be presenting their new 
business model before the council on 
Wednesday, following a public forum 
on the matter.

tors to the board instead.

Although Lakhani feels that 
appointing students to the advisory 
board would would better incorporate 
student involvement and give  sena-
tors time to focus on their yearly proj-
ects, he said that the committee ulti-
mately felt that senators would make 

more responsible decisions since they 
could be better held accountable for 
their actions.

AVP Athletic Relations and 2009-
10 VP Finance-elect Peter Benesch 
— who worked with Lakhani on 
developing the new funding process 
— believes that for now, the council’s 
skepticism over student capabilities 
will predominate.

“Basically, it’s just going have to 
turn into a senator-based commit-
tee,” Benesch said. “What we can do 
is … let [the committee] establish 
itself, and [later] outside individu-
als can be incorporated into the

The sudden departure of Muir 

Surf and Skate from campus was 
met with surprise by frequenters of 
the shop.

“It was always convenient and 
quick because it was right there,” 
Muir College freshman and avid 
surfer Casey Owen said.

The store also played into the 
independent spirit of Muir College, 
which was known for being one of 
the only campuses in the country to 

boast its own surf shop.
Owen said that when he attended 

admit day as a prospective student, 
he received a good deal from Muir 
Surf and Skate on a wetsuit. Though 
it wasn’t his primary motivation to 
attend UCSD, he said that it factored 
into his decision and got him excited 
for college.

“[I thought], I want to go there, 
there’s even a surf shop near the 
dorms,” Owen said.

Though the shop is no longer on 
campus, it still provides the same 

services at its new location. UCSD 
students receive the same 15 percent 
discount on wetsuits, Rainbow san-
dals and other select items.

“We still support UCSD,” 
Lembach said. “We really enjoyed 
working with students, and love 
surfing and skating. We love doing 
what we do. Everything we have 
done in the past is the same, and we 
have not changed.”

Sorry, I can’t help myself, I have to brag: I was lucky enough to see the Beatles play at 
Coachella last Friday. OK, maybe 
it was technically just an aged Paul 
McCartney, but if you closed your 
eyes, opened your mind to a land-
scape compilation of everything 
you’ve ever read about the Fab Four 
and sank into the field of cheering 
fans the likes of black-and-white 
Beatlemania film rolls, I swear it 
was magic. 

Stay with me — this is going 
somewhere. So after the show, as 
I stumbled dreamily toward my 
friends at the yellow-tarped star-
shaped bamboo edifice that was 
probably only erected for the 
express purpose of finding the 
friends you were separated from in 
a music-and-heat-fueled delirium, 
I passed a middle-aged McCartney 
fan remarking loudly to her festival 
mate. 

Apparently she just couldn’t 
believe that there were so many 
young people at the show — how 
could we even know those songs, 
she wondered aloud, as they were 
written decades before any of us 
were born!

This reminded me of the same 
mystified inquires I usually get from 
my mom when she hears me listen-
ing to Cat Stevens, or the bewil-
dered face my uncle makes when I 
recommend a Bob Dylan album to 
his daughters. It’s as if the idea that 
one could enjoy anything that came 
before herself is totally foreign, and 
almost threatening.

But the Beatles, Cat Stevens and 
Bob Dylan are all pretty big names 
— I would be surprised to find any-
one living in America who hadn’t at 
least heard of them.

Plus, thanks to the Internet — 
a little piece of technology most 
of our parents still haven’t totally 
mastered — kids who grew up in 
the ’80s and ’90s have a way more 
extensive knowledge of music than 
any previous generation. 

It’s a pretty big claim, I know. 
But if you don’t believe me, scroll 
through your iPod. Right now I’ve 
got a range that includes the afore-
mentioned trio, the Jackson 5, the 
Fiery Furnaces, Frank Sinatra, the 
Hold Steady, Beyoncé, Green Day, 
the Pointer Sisters, Fela Kuti and 
Cloud Cult. My mom’s CD rota-
tion? The Eagles, James Taylor and 
U2 — only.

And anyway, by the this-hap-
pened-before-you-were-born logic, 
people of our parents’ generation 
would only be eating food cooked 
in microwaves, seeing as the oven 
clearly predates their births; no 
one would read books; most people 
wouldn’t be vaccinated against dis-
eases like polio; and sex and beer 
would be unfortunately absent from 
our lives.

So next time your dad implies 
you’re a poser because that Ramones 
album you’re jamming to definitely 
predates your conception, just tell 
him those shoes he’s wearing are so 
prehistoric.

STUDENT LIFE — It’s inevitable: If 
you’ve ever lived on campus, you too 
have visited a barren dining hall on 
Saturday and dreamed of a world in 
which you could break free from your 
meal-plan shackles and swipe your 
student ID for a Subway footlong. 

Each year, on-campus residents 
must cough-up either $2,100 or $2,750 
(depending on whether they live in a 
dorm or an apartment) for a dining 
plan — quite a commitment when 

tastier options await students’ mal-
nourished fingertips in Price Center. 
Especially when the cost of fresh 
meals is too much for dining halls to 
maintain on week-
ends, when fewer 
customers make for 
an array of premade 
dishes basking idly 
under the glow of a 
heat lamp. 

It’s past time 
dining dollars were 
given some much-
needed legroom. If 
they could be used 
at all on-campus 
restaurants, students 
would see fresher options and current 
dining facilities wouldn’t be stretched 
to stay open when operational limita-
tions don’t allow.

On Jan. 23, Associate Director 

of Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
Steve Casad responded to student din-
ing complaints by proposing to add 
extra dollars to residents’ prepaid din-

ing plans so they 
would have money 
to spend at other 
restaurants on cam-
pus. However, his 
idea was rejected 
by a 10-student 
advisory committee 
comprised of mem-
bers from the A.S. 
Council, the Inter-
College Residents’ 
Association and all 
six colleges. Casad’s 

proposal was denied because it ulti-
mately missed the point. The majority 
of committee members saw no point 
in forcing students to buy extra dining 
dollars when they could ultimately use 

TritonPlus,  a voluntary  card-swiping 
program with a similar function. 

Casad’s original proposal may have 
been shot down, but that doesn’t mean 
negotiations should stop. The advisory 
committee could gauge student inter-
est in adding Price Center eateries to 
their dining-dollar options and pro-
ceed accordingly. There’s no harm in 
surveying students — especially when 
the alternative leaves dining halls in a 
financial rut and diners without per-
fectly viable variety.

Instead of forcing students to pay 
more up front, as Casad suggested, 
the Housing and Dining Department 
could allot a certain number of din-
ing dollars to cover weekend meal 
expenses, then reimburse those busi-
nesses accordingly. 

Many schools around the nation

A.S. COUNCIL — Sure, it was pretty 
shocking that the A.S. Council moved 
to keep the Grove Caffe open in 2007, 
even after the enterprise had slipped 
significantly into the red and then-
co-owner Ron Carlson jumped ship, 
leaving students in the vulnerable 
position to bear the debt alone.

It was pretty shocking that in less 
than a year, the new council-hired 
professional manager Cleveland 
Thomas threw logic and reasonable 
business practices to the wind, alien-
ated the majority of Grove enthusiasts 
and quintupled the decades-acquired 
debt he was hired to fix.

It was pretty shocking that even as 
councilmembers ran a referendum to 
increase student fees this winter and 
campaigned on platforms of fiscal 
transparency and council account-
ability a quarter later, none were con-
cerned with their $126,000-in-debt 
enterprise.

And it’s pretty shocking that Grove 
employees’ only response to all of this 
— and to the cafe’s possible closure 
— is to sell cheap T-shirts, hand out 
candy on Library Walk and rally for 
more funding.

But nothing looks shocking about 
this Wednesday’s A.S. meeting, at 
which councilmembers will discuss 
and decide the Grove’s fate in eerily 
2007-esque fashion. The meeting will 
be preceded by an A.S. Forum — 
proven, of course, to be the most 
effective way of judging student opin-
ion and informing complex finan-
cial decisions, based on its ability to 
draw neutral input from all types of 
students, rather than, you know, just 
attracting the handful of people who 
are personally invested in keeping 
their jobs at the cafe. 

Although this big choice is just 
two days away, councilmembers 
remain uninformed about the Grove’s 
current state of affairs. Associate Vice 
President of Enterprise Operations 
Chelsea Maxwell, who has been 
responsible for overseeing Grove suc-
cess and acting as a council-enterprise 
liaison for the last two years, doesn’t 
know what’s been going on at the cafe 
and has no recommendations for the 
council. Vice President of Finance 
and Resources Naasir Lakhani, who 
is responsible for council finances, is

one of the Grove’s fiercest supporters 
despite its persistent monetary losses. 
And cafe employees, who will plead 
their case at the council meeting and 
still haven’t come up with a concrete 
business plan, are plowing blindly 
ahead on a whine and a prayer.

By all accounts, Thomas — sail-
ing on salary until his contract ends 
in June — has checked out, giving 
student managers Thomas Frank 
and Autumn Hays free reign over the 
place (which, according to current 
and former student employees, has 
only added to the cafe’s inefficiency). 
The pair will now present their “busi-
ness plan” — a random and largely 
unfeasible wishlist that lacks any sem-
blance of fiscal analysis or historical 
perspective — to the council.

The plan includes a move away 
from coffee drinks toward lunch food, 
even though much of the current debt 
was accrued when Thomas updated 
coffee and espresso-machine equip-
ment. Frank and Hays said they plan 
to stay with the same food vendors, 
but haven’t researched the expenses 
involved with an increase in food or if 
customers are even interested.

Moreover, they want to purchase a 
conveyor oven (the several-thousand-
dollar cost of which they have no 
plan to fund) to mimic the dining 

commons’ pizza and sandwich ser-
vice, trading one campus surplus for 
another. 

The pair also proposes that the 
council relocate Bear Gardens to 
the Grove and pay the cafe to cater 
those events. Forget for a moment 
that this would likely increase event 
costs for a worse product, and would 
mean throwing even more student 
money at the failing cafe — it simply 
isn’t feasible. According to Associate 
Vice President of Programming 
Garrett Berg, whose office plans Bear 
Gardens, the Grove lacks the neces-
sary space and resources. 

Most outrageously, Frank and Hays 
have suggested that the council fund 
the enterprise as if it were a student 
org (and as if absorbing a $126,000 
debt wasn’t enough). This illustrates 
one of the fundamental problems with 
the Grove: No one seems to recognize 
it’s a business that should be mak-
ing money for the council, not the 
other way around. The purpose of an 
enterprise is to bring the Associated 
Students revenue so the council’s bud-
get won’t be so desperately dependent 

KIM CYPRIAN/GUARDIAN

on student fees. 
The cafe’s future looks bleak: 

Grove managers and employees 
remain completely out of touch, and 
councilmembers (particularly those 
specifically charged with overseeing 
the enterprise) remain unconcerned 
and even disinterested. But despite 
all the overwhelming evidence to 
the contrary, some councilmembers 
are stubbornly attached to the floun-
dering cafe. Students can only hope 
that this year’s council really has the 
institutional memory it brags about, 
finally bringing an end to this bal-
looning debt — rather than meeting 
the Grove’s give-us-one-more-chance 
presentation with 2007’s leave-it-to-
the-next-council mentality.

are closing their dining facilities on the weekends 
due to a declining customer base and lost profit, 
according to Casad. At UCSD, approximately 40 
percent of every dining dollar goes toward work-
ers’ salaries, making it expensive to keep facilities 
open on weekends while simultaneously provid-
ing enough fresh options for students. Dining 
hall revenue also drops a staggering 60 percent 
on weekends, according to Casad. Saturday and 
Sunday Price Center dollars, paired with shut-
ting down or reducing service at the dining halls, 
would help alleviate this revenue loss. 

At San Diego State University, students’ dining 
dollars can be redeemed at on-campus cafeterias 
and 16 local restaurants or markets — includ-
ing Starbucks, Rubio’s and an Aztec market and 
convenience store — eliminating the need to 
scrounge for change or swipe another credit card. 

Closing dining halls on the weekend has been 
discussed briefly within the advisory commit-
tee, but trial runs must be made before any new 

policies are adopted, Casad said. Because Sierra 
Summit will be closed during the 2009-10 aca-
demic year for renovations, Casad wants to use 
this period as a test run to evaluate how a closed 
dining facility impacts students.

In the end, though — be it through campus-
wide surveying or, perhaps, a series of town-hall 
style meetings in the dining halls — the decision 
of the advisory committee will only reflect the 
wants and needs of students once they’ve had a 
chance to have their say. Because, after all, these 
are changes that would affect everybody, not just 
the 10-member committee holding the sway. 

In such a large and limited community, resi-
dents should be presented with every possible 
opportunity to tailor their lifestyle. A change as 
positive and as pragmatic as this one must be 
aggressively pursued — otherwise, both students 
and the dining halls will continue suffering.

UCSDGUARDIAN’sTHE

I n the college student-infested complexes near campus, peace and quiet comes with a pricetag. For a slightly higher rent, Regents Court offers a fully gated apartment setting with an 
emphasis on community — one can generally count on a muted 
atmosphere when trying to get some work done. On the flip side, 
due to the number of resident families, a party is not the required 
minimum for being slammed with a noise complaint. Management 
and maintenance staff are quick to respond to tenants, and facilities 
are attractive and well-maintained. But practice precision parking 
before tackling the multilevel garage, or risk damaging your car 
while maneuvering in and out of cramped spaces.

Housing Guide

A s one of the older complexes nearby, La Jolla International Gardens is in dire need of remodeling. But if you can overlook the 
inevitable aging-appliance breakdowns — and the 
time it takes for the leasing office to fix them — the 
complex offers decently sized living quarters at a 
cheaper price and convenient access to two campus 
shuttle lines. When choosing your location, pay 
attention to its relation to the laundry room, as 
washers and dryers are not interior features. Also be 
prepared to pay up for a mandatory carpet cleaning 
when you move out, although you’ll notice it was far 
from spotless to begin with.

— Emily Ku
Senior Staff Writer

C onvenience is the key word when describ-ing why a person would choose to live in Costa Verde Village Apartments. Its 
proximity to campus and the fact that the complex 
is surrounded on all sides by shuttling options are 
huge factors in why so many students opt to live 
there. 

The units are spacious enough. And having a 
washer and dryer inside the apartment radically 
reduces the risk of finding your wet laundry sim-
pering in a pathetic pile on top of the machine or 
countertop. Paying the water bill, not so attractive, 
but it’s a small price to pay to ensure that articles 
of clothing aren’t lost.

Of course there are downsides to living in 
Costa Verde Apartments. The office staffers 
aren’t very friendly — some are downright snob-
bish — and are easily peeved by simple ques-
tions such as where to pick up your FedEx and 
UPS packages. Furthermore, the appliances are 
a touch too breakable, and one of the elevators 
in my building breaks down at least once every 
two weeks. It is notoriously unreliable around 
the time a new quarter starts — the mass influx 
of students returning to their apartments after a 
long weekend or break with friends and family 
is apparently too much for that poor complex to 
handle.

Thankfully, maintenance service is fairly good 
at and quick to repair the various complications in 
the apartments. Friendly, too.

The overall experience of living in Costa 
Verde is alright. Rent is on the pricier side — 
about $2,025 for two bedrooms and a loft, and 
that’s a bargain. Nevertheless, living so close to 
the Arriba shuttle line’s first stop is a perk simply 
too coveted to pass on, particularly as class rolls 
around at 9 a.m.

A fter living at the Verano condominium complex for two years, you come to realize a few things about the place. The most concerning is that Verano boasts quite possibly one of the most hardcore parking-lot 
security forces in all of UTC.

It’s hard to complain about the abundance of parking for residents, though.
What’s more, the place is actually fairly serene. Four vibrant shades of brown 
adorn the stucco walls and the Mormon temple’s soaring ivory towers make the 
place look like Narnia after several years of rapid suburban development. 

And while devoid of any local nightlife — save for that one guy who plays 
shitty renditions of John Mayer songs in front of Tapioca Express some evenings 
— the neighborhood is conveniently close to campus. Best of all, the nearby 
shopping center offers fairly excellent double-wrapped burritos until 2 a.m. I 
recommend the Cali Monster with extra avocado.

H illcrest has a lot more going for it than just the Gay Pride Parade. Although, the parade 
is reason enough to shack up in one of 
the most fabulous neighborhoods San 
Diego has to offer. 

With some of the city’s best dining, 
from Crest Cafe on Robinson Avenue 
to Bronx Pizza on Washington Street, a 
bite to eat is never so delicious or easy 
to come by as it is in Hillcrest. Ethnic 
eateries are also nearly impossible to 
avoid and Whole Foods, Rite Aid and 
Ralphs are almost too close for comfort 
— as are dozens of over-priced over-
trendy thrift shops. 

A night out is never far and no 
matter your preference, there’s a bar or 
club to suit. Universal overloads in the 
late evening hours and Numbers (just 
south of University Avenue on Park 
Boulevard) sports shirtless bartenders 
and a crowd straight from LIPS, while 
Alibi’s the seediest biker-style dive bar 
near the city center. Even campus is 
more accessible than anywhere but the 
worst La Jolla has to offer. A hop, skip 
or bike ride to La Jolla Medical Center 
will put you at the Campus-Hillcrest 
shuttle. Fabulous indeed.

Hillcrest

L odged in a suburban side street just 15 minutes walking dis-tance to the Regents shuttle, Playmor is like any other La Jolla housing unit: a peaceful neighborhood with bad parking. If 
you’re charmed by ’70s decor, you’ll go wild for each apartment’s 
glass-shingled chandelier and metal-rod staircase. But beware: 
Playmor’s vintage interior comes at the price of janky house fix-
tures, and since each apartment has its own landlord, decorating 
leeway and general maintenance will vary. The complex’s perks 
include an unpopulated pool, hot tub and nearby canyon trail, but 
if you can’t handle a fixer-upper take your rent money elsewhere.

I f you want excitement, Clairemont is not exactly the place to be. The quiet neighborhood east of Pacific Beach is comprised mostly of young families and retired veterans, with a spattering of college students living in their midst. With front-yard McCain-Palin signs 
outnumbering Obama-Biden ones from November’s election, the atmosphere could hardly 
be described as liberal or college friendly. Beyond walking distance to any bars and gener-
ally a few miles from most UCSD house parties, going without a car would put an end to 
your social life in this neighborhood.

But, assuming you have reliable transportation, Clairemont is only five minutes away 
from P.B. and just a 10-minute drive from downtown and Ocean Beach — close to all the 
action, but just far enough to avoid the noise and traffic. Driving to school never takes more 
than 15 minutes when using local streets, and the 41 bus takes you right to campus, helping 
you avoid UCSD parking and its inordinate fees. With Ralphs, Vons, Henry’s and dozens of 
restaurants a short walk from most of the neighborhood’s housing, food is easily accessible. 
And if all else fails, Cotixan is always good for large servings of 24-hour Mexican food. 
Decently sized bedrooms in single-family homes can easily be found from $450 to $650. 

Not the flashiest neighborhood that San Diego has to offer, Clairemont still has its 
quirks. It’s home to a handful of thrift shops, vegan restaurants and more comic-book stores 
than anyone would need to visit in their lifetime. Conveniently located and reasonably 
priced, the neighborhood is a nice option — if you don’t mind driving to the party.

T here are three things you need to know about liv-ing in Pacific Beach: location, location, location. Although right-off-Garnet complexes are a plenty in 
this three-college town, the extra effort it takes to find a 
sick residential rental will come back tenfold when you 
aren’t confronted with constant beach-and-bar buzz or 
awakened at 3 a.m. to liquor-fueled lawn arguments each 
night. Plus, landlords are likely to be much more chill 
when the whole block isn’t flooded with irresponsible 
college types.

You can walk just about anywhere in P.B., so prox-
imity to beach versus freeway is really just a matter of 
preference. If you’re willing to throw down a few extra 
Benjamins a year to live beachside, be ready for a longer 
trek to campus. By car it only takes about 15 minutes to 
get to school, but double that during rush hour — when 
P.B.’s lone on-ramp backs up as a mass of students and res-
idents head out — and triple it when you opt for cheaper, 
but wait-intensive public transportation.

P.B. has everything a college student could ask for: 
thrifting at Goodwill-style segundos and indie-fabulous 
boutiques a la Buffalo Exchange; trendy, hipster or just 
plain expensive clothes stores; and nighttime hot spots 
ranging from gloriously shady dives to “The Real World: 
San Diego”’s bar of choice. Add to that a festival of sushi, 
pizza, burgers, Slurpees and ’berto’s 24-hour Mexican 
food. And it’s the county’s epicenter for tattoo parlors 
and record, sex and smoke shops — perfect to satiate any 
college-rebellion dreams you’ve been harboring.

W hen you live in University Heights, your cultured-ness is imme-diately quadrupled: the local Starbucks suddenly becomes a comfy couch-plentiful coffee shop by the name of Twiggs, 
Roberto’s becomes a seafood taco shack called El Zarape and Happy Hour 
at Rock Bottom becomes $1 drink night at Cheers. What’s even better is 
that almost everything you need is within walking or biking distance from 
your quaint little neighborhood — saving you gas and allowing for more 
neighborly interaction. 

Only problem is living in University Heights is your social life. You’ll 
either have to recruit a good group of buddies to move with you or learn 
to rub shoulders with the locals — it takes some serious cajoling to con-
vince your La Jolla friend contingent to make the 20-minute drive down 
to your ’hood. The daily campus commute is a bitch too; you either have 
to bike down to Hillcrest Medical Center and catch a 30-minute shuttle 
or make a daily drive up I-5. Either way, being stuck in the area isn’t too 
bad: Hillcrest, North Park and downtown are at your side to help you cope 
with the loneliness.

A little beaten, a little bruised, Ocean Beach is San Diego with character. Yeah, there’s a little dirt under its nails, but O.B. talks so smooth you’re sure to swoon. 
Community, waves and vegan-hippie ideals run deep, but it 
doesn’t matter if you’re down, just that you’re here. Tight-knit 
but welcoming, O.B. is a throwback to isolated beachfront overrun 
by tattered surf shacks and half-cocked, motel-style apartments. 
Buried on the end of Highway 8, it feels light years away from 
the city, but fitting into O.B. is easy — it’s getting out that’s tough.

The bus system is weak, and getting weaker; the drive to I-5 
is roundabout. But, with every need right there — from coffee 
dives, supermarkets and sandwich shops to pubs, live bands and 
biker bars, who needs to leave? Pretty soon you’ll be hitting the 
books on the patio of Pizza Bar at the end of Newport Avenue, 
or podcasting classes over a gin and tonic glowing in the black 
lights of Pac Shores. If you’re going to live on the coast, it might 
as well be in a ratty beach town.

T he Windansea house hunt is not something I would wish on even my archenemies. However, if you finally do spot a modest beach house squished between vacation rentals, are willing to convert 
every room into a triple (couldn’t be worse than the dorms) and can 
convince a skeptical landlord that your penniless surfer gang is a more 
worthy cause than that three-person dream family with a magic puke-
free baby and better credit than Aladdin, the three-month Craigslist 
battle will be more than worth it.

First off, San Diego’s least crowded, arguably most awesome strip of 
sand is your backyard. And if nature isn’t doing it for you, $2 well drinks 
at the Shack and 24 hours of 7-Eleven Slurpees and Rigoberto’s breakfast 
burritos are just a late-night stumble away. Nearby Pearl Street is explod-
ing with fresh fish, fruit and exotic staples — Thai, Mongolian, sushi, 
crepes, Starbucks, you name it — and groceries aren’t much further: 
Stop by Vons on the way to or from campus, or head 10 minutes south 
to raid Trader Joe’s and Henry’s in Pacific Beach.

The route to campus may be a tedious obstacle course of Sunday drivers 
and censorless stoplights, but the MTS bus route 30 heads straight through 
the Windansea neighborhood for a free half-hour ride to school — break 
out a textbook or just enjoy your daily dose of unreal coastline views.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS 

BY ASHLEY LEE
STAFF WRITER

W hen members of the Guardian see palettes of untouched newspapers discarded behind the Dumpsters at the Student Center, we die a lit-
tle inside. When Revelle College sophomore Samantha 
Sanchez comes across these unread mounds, she sees 
endless fashion potential.

On April 24 at the Loft, closing out UCSD’s traditional 
Earth Week lineup, Project Trashion will merge trash with 
fashion, giving students a creative outlet to show their 
love for Mother Earth. The eco-friendly fashion show will 
bring local merchants and student designers together to 
send their green garments and accessories down the run-
way. The Trashion show will be preceded by VidFest — a 
student short film contest with an emphasis on spreading 
awareness of environmental issues — and wrap up with a 
DJ dance party at the Loft.

“At UCSD, a lot of the efforts for sustainability are 
more at the operations level — the building level, with 
our solar panels and other energy efficient technology. 
There’s a creative aspect to sustainability that’s not as 
evident,” Earl Warren college senior and Project Trashion 
coordinator Ashley Ferrer said. “We wanted to reach out 
to students who are creative, and we wanted to put on 
something that was a bit more social and creative at the 
same time.”

The show will open with designs from Joy Fabiano, 
Simply Defined, O’Neill, Billabong, Maitri, Niksters 
Bikinis, Sela Wear, The Verde Bag and Flashback Recycled 
Fashions.

Simply Defined, founded earlier this year by profes-
sional designer Angela Du — who herself will don an 
outfit made of aluminum cans — will be debuting a line 
of green dresses fashioned out of everything from brown 
paper bags to plastic water bottles and newspapers.

“I hope that people see that recycling and being all 
about the green can be sexy,” Du said. “I feel like there’s a 

certain stereotype on people who are eco-friendly, and I 
don’t think they have to be people who are activists. It can 
be anybody … every little bit helps.” 

Seventeen student designers have expressed interest 
in entering the show. With the addition of professional 
designers, the runway will feature about 30 sustainable 
outfits and accessories. 

Ferrer said the student entries do not have to be as pol-
ished as those of the professional designers, and that judg-
ing will not be based on complexity or intricacy of design. 
Garments and accessories will be judged by Sustainability 
Coordinator Maggie Souder, Sustainability Analyst at the 
Sustainability Solutions Institute Kristin Blackler and one 
other judge, who is yet to be determined. 

Those who rock the categories of best use of recyclable 
materials, best use of sustainable materials and best use 
of household materials will take home complementary 
passes to the San Diego Natural History Museum.

“We’re not rewarding a first place or second place 
and we’re not here to say who can come up with the best 
design,” Ferrer said. “Some people are professionals and 
that’s great. I’m completely challenged and wouldn’t be 
able to hem a hole in my clothes, but I can probably throw 
something together … If someone wants to make a bottle-
cap necklace, that’s awesome, trendy, and reasonable.”

Although she has undertaken a few design projects 
before, Sixth College junior Jacqueline Tran admits that 
the thought of sewing plastic grocery bags together made 
her reluctant to enter the show. The top of her dress 
will be made of scrunched plastic grocery bags to create 
ruching, and the bottom will be made of tulle from an 
old Halloween costume and crushed soda cans cinched 
together with string and ribbon instead of thread.

“I liked the whole ‘taking things out of the recycling bin’

T hough illegal under federal law, 13 states — including California — per-mit the use of marijuana for medical 
purposes. 

During former President George W. 
Bush’s tenure, the federal government set 
a precedent of overriding state laws and 
raiding legal medical marijauna dispensa-
ries. On March 18, U.S. Attorney General 
Eric Holder, on behalf of President 
Barack Obama, assured the nation that 
federal laws banning medical marijuana 
will not interfere with individual state 
regulations; however, Drug Enforcement 

Administration raids on California dis-
pensaries in recent months have proved-
notherwise.

Dispensaries have sprouted ubiqui-
tously to meet growing demand, due 
largely to the affordability of the drug 
compared to standard pharmaceuticals, 
seeing as at least 45 million Americans 
under the age of 65 don’t have access to 
affordable health insurance, according to 
the Congressional Budget Office.

On April 14, 2009, Americans for Safe 
Access, a national advocacy organization 
with more than 30,000 members in 40 

states, challenged the validity of the longstand-
ing federal assertion that “marijuana has no 
currently accepted medical use in treatment 
in the United States.” ASA called the statement 
— issued by the Department of Health and 
Human Services under the Bush administra-
tion — outdated and reactionary. 

ASA claims marijuana to be an effective pain 
reliever for various ailments, including muscu-
lar dystrophy and glaucoma. Additionally, stud-
ies conducted within the California Medical 
Marijuana Research Program, established by 
the University of California, have demonstrat-
ed that the drug restores the appetites of nause-
ated patients with AIDS and cancer.

However, several federal regulations and 
restrictions on not only distribution, but 
also research grants and access to approved 
research-grade crops, prevent large-scale stud-
ies from being conducted effectively.

“The federal government is in a position 
where they have a double standard on medical 
cannabis,” said Kris Hermes, a public relations 
representative for ASA. “They refuse to admit 
there is medical value to the plant itself, but 
even officials who work for National Institute 
on Drug Abuse claim that its components have 

medical value.”
Last year, Mark Wallace, professor of anes-

thesiology at the UCSD School of Medicine, 
studied the pain-relieving quality of tetra-
hydrocannabinol (THC), a potent chemical 
found in the marijuana plant, by injecting 
patients with the pain-producer capsaicin — a 
pepper extract — after they had inhaled the 
drug. He concluded that a balance must be 
reached for marijuana to effectively decrease 
pain, and that too much can actually increase 
pain. Currently, Wallace is studying the effects 
of marijuana on patients with diabetes.

“With the center for medicinal marijuana 
research, we’re coming out with some good 
studies, but it’s only the beginning, and the prob-
lem is that they’re single-site studies,” Wallace 
said. “In order to get really good evidence, you 
need multicenter, blinded, randomized studies 
with lots of patients. If you’re doing multicenter 
studies from different states, then you have to 
deal with different state laws, so it makes it very 
challenging. Until the federal government lifts 
their restrictions, it’s going to be extremely dif-
ficult to study.”

The federal government has placed 
heavy restrictions on medical marijua-
na research, including a provision lim-
iting the cultivation of research-grade 
marijuana to only ElSohly Laboratories, 
Incorporated — a private government-
sponsored company in Mississippi. 

Wallace said this grants complete 
regulatory power to the government 
regarding the approval of any study, a 
process that stalled his own research 
for more than two years. 

Five years ago, ASA filed charges 
against the Department of Health and 
Human Services for distributing false 
information to the public regarding 
the medicinal value of marijuana. 

Because no action was taken, the 
organization filed suit again in 2007, 
arguing that the federal government 
was guilty of breaking its own Data 
Quality Act, a law “ensuring and 
maximizing the quality, objectivity, 
utility and integrity of information 
(including statistical information) 

disseminated by federal agencies.” 
The lawsuit was rejected later that 

year by the U.S. District Court. 
Despite research supporting the 

use of marijuana as a pain reliv-
er, gleaned through studies like 
Wallace’s, the federal government has 
been slow to reverse its longstand-
ing classification of marijuana as a 
Schedule 1 substance, for which there 
is no accepted medical use.

“The health sciences have indi-
cated that marijuana can be a useful 
pain reliever for some people who do 
not respond to other medications,” 
said political science professor David 
Mares, who specializes in interna-
tional drug trafficking, politics and 
policy. “If science were the basis of 
our marijuana laws, its classifica-
tion in our Schedule of Controlled 
Substances would have to be altered 
to permit medicinal use. Of course, 
if science were the basis of our drug 
laws, tobacco would be a Schedule 1 
substance: highly addictive, no cur-

rently accepted medical use in the 
U.S. and no safe way to use it under 
medical supervision.”

Lawyers for the organization sat 
before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals 
on April 14 to appeal the lower court’s 
2007 decision, claiming it was based on 
conservative values and politics rather 
than tangible scientific evidence. They 
also said that disregarding abundant 
scientific studies contradicts the new 
administration’s promise.

“What amazes me is that mar-
ijuana is illegal for medicinal use 
in this country, yet there are other 
drugs that are much more risky and 
have much more abuse potential than 
marijuana: narcotics, opiates, mor-
phine-like drugs … and yet those 
are legal for medicinal uses,” Wallace 
said. “There’s no known lethal dosage 
of marijuana, but there’s a clear lethal 
dose of the opiates.”

abl001@ucsd.edu.

as opposed to using hemp [to make the 
garment] because I’m not very good 
at just sewing — I would rather just 
put something together,” Tran said. 
“[Project Trashion] kind of reminded 
me of ‘Derelicte’ from Zoolander so I 
took inspiration from that.”

Sanchez, who sews as a hobby and 
has her own crafting blog, feels more 
comfortable with her newspaper dress 
design than Tran and even plans to 
incorporate plastic grocery bags. She 
has also been experimenting with gro-
cery bags and heat, ironing sheets of 
plastic together to create thicker mate-
rial. Sanchez hopes the show will alert 
guests to the ways they can conserve.

“There will be a lot of cool stuff 
there to look at, but realistically, you 

can’t wear a newspaper dress every 
day. But you can go to thrift stores 
and learn how to sew and be cre-
ative,” Sanchez said. “If not, I hope that 
people know that the companies that 
they do shop at are starting to have 
sustainable options and they can shift 
their buying practices to that.”

Project Trashion will showcase its 
philanthropic side through a silent auc-
tion to raise money for Sacred Heart 
Secondary School in Uganda through 
the organization Schools for Schools, a 
subset of Invisible Children, which has 
a chapter at UCSD. The event is free to 
attend, but students can purchase raffle 
tickets for a chance to win sustainable 
products donated by the show’s profes-
sional designers. This swag includes 
a gift card to Flashbacks Recycled 

Fashions; a Verde Bag starter kit (one 
shopping bag, one medium produce 
bag, one small gift wrapping cloth); a 
gift bag of sustainable products from 
the UCSD Bookstore; T-shirts and bags 
from Nikster Bikinis and body products 
from L’Occitane and the Body Shop.

All proceeds will help renovate 
Sacred Heart’s facilities; buy textbooks, 
art and sports materials; promote clean 
water and sanitation and purchase 
classroom technology.

 “We wanted to put something on 
that could accomplish the two goals of 
environmentalism and social justice,” 
Ferrer said. “It’s really an engaging and 
interactive conclusion to Earth Week.”

S ITESEEN
RALPHS
CANDY AISLE

I am standing between two solid walls of candy. My fingers twitch slightly. Three chubby preteens 
eagerly stuff gummy bears and malted 
milk balls into their gaping maws. 
They stop when they see me staring. 
I nod in approval and they quickly 
resume their gluttonous ritual.  

With bloodshot eyes, I hungrily 
scan my surroundings. Two bong loads 
ago I was unsure whether I would find 
the Ralph’s candy aisle to be as tanta-
lizing as my colleagues had described 
it. I have visited many a candy shop 
in my life, after all. How could a mere 
supermarket contain any bounty more 
impressive than the chocolate peddlers 
of London or the delectable display I 
witnessed at the Jelly Belly factory as 
a child? 

Now, thoroughly blazed and strick-
en by the weed-induced hunger I’ve 
come to know and love so well, I real-
ize I was wrong to have ever doubted 
this place. 

I make my way over to a bin full 
of Swedish fish and carefully lift the 
plastic lid. Paranoid, I quickly glance 
up and down the aisle before shoving 
a small handful of the rubbery morsels 
into my mouth. Bliss.

I have found few things in this 
world that taste better than free 
candy. My rotund candy-aisle com-

patriots seem to agree. They have far 
outpaced me in this race. I scramble 
to catch up, diving headlong into 
bin after bin of chocolate-covered 
gummy bears, sour watermelons, 
sugar-coated worms and those little 
deer-shit drops of minty chocolate 
that the elderly seem to like so much.

“Where the fuck are the Swedish 
fish?” one of them ponders aloud. 

I point him in the right direction. 
His vulgarity is understandable in this 
setting — hoarding candy is some 
serious fucking business. There is little 
room for niceties when buckets of 
crystalized sugar are at stake.

Four licorice ropes, a fistful of sour 
bears and 16 gumballs later, I dis-
cover something called pebbles. Just 
pebbles. No further description neces-
sary. They look like rocks and they are 
fucking delicious. 

If you do nothing else on this holi-
est of stoner days, pack a bowl of your 
stickiest stash (I went with a delightful 
little strain called Purple Nice) and 
head over to Ralphs. Look out for lurk-
ing red polos and don’t forget to try the 
pebbles.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — No. 10 UCSD

RIMAC Arena, edged by No. 8 Long Beach 
State University in four sets and sweeping Grand 
Canyon University in the season finale. Clinging  
to playoff hopes, the Tritons fell short in the last 
two sets against Long Beach State. The game 
ended in a score of 28-30, 30-26, 31-29, 30-28,

the Tritons played their final game of the season 
in an emotional sweep of Grand Canyon.

The Tritons came into Friday night clinging to 
the hope that they could somehow squeak into the 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation playoffs. In 
order for the dominoes to fall in place, UCSD had 
to beat Long Beach State and get some help from 
other MPSF teams playing contests last weekend. 

Unfortunately, the Tritons could not hold 
their end of the bargain against the 49ers.

UCSD brought its A-game into RIMAC 
Friday night, but the 49ers came in with an inten-
sity fueled by their previous loss to the Tritons. 
With the playoffs in sight for both teams, an all-
out battle ensued.

The first set was a telling preview, as it includ-
ed 13 ties and six lead changes. The 49ers jumped 

ahead 20-15 before the Tritons came storming 
back to tie it up at 24. Later, with the score tied 
at 27, senior middle blocker Gerald Houseman 
sent down a kill and Ross followed with one of 
his own, forcing a set point. Junior opposite Frank 
Fritsch then sealed set one with a kill at 30-28 for 
the Tritons.

The second set saw Long Beach State outhit 
the Tritons .323 to .167, allowing the 49ers to take 
the momentum in the game after a 30-26 win.

The third set was another war, featuring 15 ties 
and seven lead changes. Down 28-27, Houseman 
sent down back-to-back kills to give UCSD a 
29-28 advantage. But, the 49ers took advantage of 
a UCSD error and won the set on an ace.

The fourth set saw 15 ties and eight lead 
changes, as the Tritons refused to go down with-
out a fight in their home court with the playoffs 
on the line. Tied at 28, a 49er kill and UCSD error 
became the torpedos that sank the Triton ship.

“I definitely think we fought pretty hard,” 
Houseman said. “We had a few lapses but Long 
Beach played really well. We were satisfied with 
our performance, just not the result.”

In the Tritons’ final conference game, Fritsch 
sent down 20 kills, Houseman had 13 kills and 
Spangler added 12 kills. Ross posted nine kills and 
seven blocks while sophomore setter Phil Bannan 
added 54 assists, 10 digs and seven blocks.

The final games highlighted UCSD men’s vol-
leyball senior weekend, as libero Eric Leserman, 
opposite Aaron Hedland and Houseman were 
honored in a pregame ceremony.

In the season finale versus Grand Canyon, 
the seniors translated their final game nostal-
gia into intensity. Led by Leserman, Hedland 
and Houseman, the Tritons swept the Antelopes 
30-12, 30-20, 30-20.

UCSD came storming out of the gates in the 
first set, scoring the first eight points behind a 
service run from Spangler. UCSD led 19-5 on 
Hedland and Ross kills. Houseman sent down the 
match point for the win at 30-12.

In the second set, Grand Canyon opened to 
a 5-3 lead before the Tritons strung together a 
run. With the score tied at 10, the Tritons scored 
nine of the next 10 points to take command. 
Houseman stepped up again and closed the door 
on set two 30-12. 

The Tritons carried the early momentum 
into the third set, looking for a sweep. UCSD put 
together another impressive run, scoring nine 
straight points on a service run from junior oppo-
site hitter Peter Johnson to break the set wide 
open. Houseman then ended what he started, 
putting the set away for the sweep at 30-20.

The game was fittingly led by the seniors 
as Hedland sent down a match-high 16 kills, 
Houseman added nine kills on .667 hitting 
and Leserman laid out for six digs. As a team, 
UCSD hit at .451 and held Grand Canyon to an 
embarassing .025 hitting percentage.

The Tritons end their 2009 campaign with 
a school record 13 wins (13-15). Turning heads 
all year long, UCSD upset multiple MPSF teams, 

establishing itself as a true conferece contender.
“It’s definitely nice that we’ve been improving 

our record every year, but it obviously would have 
been impressive to make the playoffs,” Houseman 
said. “It would have been nice especially in my 
senior year to go out like that.”

MEN’S GOLF — Walking out of 
the coaches’ meeting the day before 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championship, men’s golf 
head coach Mike Wydra was shocked 
and dismayed.

His team, which arrived at Paso 
Robles, Calif., thinking it had already 
qualified for next month’s NCAA 
Division-II Super 
Regionals, was 
thrown a curve 
ball yesterday 
afternoon: The 
Tritons lost their 
automatic berth.

The top 10 
teams in the region qualify for the 
NCAA Division-II Super Regionals. 
Rankings had originally been deter-
mined by a team’s head-to-head play 
against other teams in the region. At 
the meeting, Wydra was informed that 
the selection committee is now con-
sidering how a team performs against 
other ranked teams in its region. 

“We were on a conference call and 
the gentleman informed us of the 
changes,” Wydra said. “He ran down 
the list of teams that had qualified 
and we weren’t on it anymore. We 
should’ve known about these changes 
beforehand.”

The change in qualification moved 
the Tritons from a guaranteed spot in 
the Super Regionals to a win-or-go-

home situation. UCSD must now win 
the conference tournament to qualify 
as a team for the Super Regionals, 
although two individuals have already 
done so. Wydra believes junior Raj 
Samra and sophomore Keith Okasaki’s 
scores should earn them a spot in 
the Super Regionals with senior Billy 
Olsen on the outside looking in. 
However, nothing is set in stone.

“We won’t know anything for sure 
until the conference call on Thursday,” 

he said.
Despite the 

new develop-
ments, Wydra and 
the Tritons are not 
increasing prac-
tice time, though 
their mindset has 

changed.
A shaky spring season may be 

one reason these changes affected the 
Tritons so greatly. UCSD has finished 
middle-of-the-pack in each tourna-
ment with its top finish, a sixth place, 
coming in Texas at the St. Edwards 
Invitational.

But seemingly mediocre finishes 
are skewed by the fact that UCSD 
plays in arguably the best conference 
in the nation, Wydra said.

“So many of the teams in our con-
ference and region are highly ranked,” 
he said. “If we were somewhere else, 
we would be kicking butt right now. 
But the tougher conference works to 
our advantage as it raises our level of 
play. We’ve made a lot of progress [this 

spring] and we expect to play well this 
week.”

The tough conference is now the 
Tritons’ Achilles heel. This week’s 
CCAA Championship will include the 
No. 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 ranked teams in 
the Western Region, all of which the 
Tritons must beat to avoid missing 
postseason as a team for the second 
straight year.

“The top teams have five players to 
count on while we’re still looking for 
a fourth and fifth,” he said. “But we’re 
every bit as good as those top teams.”

The Tritons have experi-
ence on their side in the CCAA 
Championships, returning to the same 
Hunter Ranch Golf Course that many 
players have seen before. Seniors 
Olsen and Ryan Bailey will be making 
their third trip to the course; Okasaki 
will be making his second. 

“This course doesn’t require a lot 
of length off the tee,” Bailey said. “It’s 
about course management: knowing 
where to place the ball off the tee and 
on the green to avoid big numbers. 
Being here before is a big help.”

But the loss of senior Nathan Phan, 
who could not devote the time needed 
to compete on the team this year, has 
created a big hole in the Triton lineup. 
Phan was the low scorer for UCSD the 
past two seasons at this event, finishing 
ninth last year and 13th the year before.

“[Nathan] would’ve been our fifth 
man,” Wydra said, referring to this 
season’s lineup. “Playing golf at a high 
level requires a large time commit-

ment and he just didn’t have time. 
There’s no way to replace his kind of 
skill and character.”

Despite Phan’s exit, the Tritons still 
have a solid trio at the top to lead the 
way. Samra has played quality golf all 
season and is expected to play well 
on the Hunter Ranch course. Okasaki 
and Olsen will round out the top three 
for the Tritons. 

Wydra expects freshman Justin 
Gabbert, who played his way into the 
lineup, to surprise some people this 
week. Team captain Bailey will round 
out the roster for the championships, 
and is helping Gabbert acclimate to 
the overwhelming championship 
atmosphere.

“I talked to Justin last night and 
told him to not put any additional 
pressure on himself trying to justify 
why he is here and not other, more 
experienced players,” Bailey said. “I 

told him that he is here for a reason 
and we already trust him. I expect 
Justin to be a dark horse in this tour-
nament.” 

Bailey added that the law of aver-
ages says that both he and Samra 
should play well this week since they 
have both been off their game the past 
few tournaments.

The Hunter Ranch Golf Course 
will play close to 7,000 yards, con-
sidered a medium-length course for 
college players today. The course fea-
tures four par fives, three of which are 
reachable in two and one of the keys 
to playing well, according to Wydra.

UCSD tees off this morning at 
7:30 a.m. in the first of two Monday 
rounds. They will play the final round 
on April 21.

Jason Spangler goes up for one of the 12 kills he posted against Long Beach State at RIMAC Arena on April 17. Spangler’s efforts, 
however, could not help UCSD avoid a four-set loss to the 49ers, a setback that elimated the Tritons from playoff contention.
