Throws in 
The Towel 
• Fonner programmer denies 
having hand in supportive flyers 
By Matt Mayo 
Staff Writer 

After over 
two years in the 
position, Mat-
thew Schnurer 
vacated his post 
as A.S. commis-
sioner of pro-
gramming, effec-
tive last Satur-
day, 

This move 
culminated 
weeks of debate 
spurred by a letter of resignation submitted by 
Schnureron Sept. 30, which stated that due to his 
financial situation, he would resign his "position 
of AS, Commissioner of Programming as it is 
currently configured." 

SIamI- The UCSD men's soccer team racked up two more wins. See Sports, page 16. 
Last week's failure of a proposal to tempo-

rarily increase Schnurer's stipend from $40 per 
week to $240 per week eliminated any chance of 
having the programming struggle resolved be-
fore Schnurer's Oct. 19 deadline. TGs, RIMAe, KSDT Discussed at At last night'S AS. meeting, Schnurer told 
the council that "leaving i rough, I've been here 
for so long, and I enjoy the position and the 
people." _ Annual A.S.-Chancellor Meeting 

By Stephanie Danford ~~-..., ~' .. •....... ' ~ .• ~ Schnurer al 0 gave advice for filling his position: "Keep in mind that this is. not a one-man show. Find someone with motivation and drive that is not afraid offailure; that i willing to get trampled by the bull trying to take it by the 
horns, In other words, have fun," 

Guardian Reporter 
In an annual meeting between Associated 

Students council executives and the administra-
tion, AS. President Agustin Orozco and Chan-
cellor Richard Atkinson met on Friday to discuss 
several issues including TGs, RIMAC, UCSD 
radio station KSDT, and campus parking. 

Orozco presented Atkinson and other admin-
istrative officers with information the A.S. has 
compiled on the possible costs of moving TGs 
from the Price Center to either Pryatel Field or 
Warren West Field 

According to Orozco, Vice Chancellor of Un-
dergraduate Affairs Joseph Watson had previ-
ouslyoffered to support the TG move, if the costs 
were not excessive. Additional funding would be 
required for moving the stage, constructing tem-
porary fences, providing security, and renting 
portable toilets.

A.S, President Agustin Orozco thanked 
Schnurer for his service and particularly "the 
increase in programming and the quality of the 
programming. " 

"I lament the fact that [SchnurerJ will be 
leaving us," he said. 

In response to a flier that was posted around 
campus yesterday, Schnurer said that he was not 
involved in it. 

"I was just as surprised as anyone else," 
Schnurer said, adding that he "was flattered."

• Historical revisionism 
helps create a more 
diverse view of history 
By Gllye Johnson 
Staff Writ.,. 

efore you right-wingers stan up all this 
controversy about historical revisionism 
again, trying to put those who teach an 
alternative viewpoint in political check. 
you'd better think again about the aims 
of those revisionists you so quickly 
condemn. 

All any of us keep hearing from the Right about this 
alleged "re-vamping" of U.S. history is thai you're 
tired of people like Thomas Jefferson, author of the 
Declaration of Independence, being condemned for 
owning slaves. 

Calm down, everyone -like all the rest of the 
white male "founding fathers," Jefferson has been 
exalted for so many years thai the Historian on High 
himself couldn't significantly change what we've been 
conditioned to believe about him. 

We've been learning hiSlory from the dominant 
point of view for so long, it's almost impossible for us 
to accept new points of view about the pasL 

This opposition has been so gallantly exemplified 
thai one might think the traditional nationalistic 
approach to history has got you IraifILd. Hmmm .... 

The way history is laught and perceived is crucial 
for the purposes of nationalism in this country.

• Modem historical 
revision is pregnant with 
a political agenda 
By lid Roblll80n 
Auoc:iaIe OpInion Editor 

or those with a sense of irony, the fall of 
communism in the Soviet Union carries 
wilh it a certain undeniable bitter-
sweetness. While the world embraces the 
liberty and freedom of thought for which 
the United States has long been the 

leading light of hope, there are those wilhin the United 
States who are prepared to conderm and even demol-
ish thal claim to history. 

Very simply put. there has appeared in the halls of 
academia a dispuIe about the legitimacy of the Western 
tradition and, more significantJy, a challenge to history. 

This historical revisionism, however, is not the 
result of the traditional self-reflection that chanM:terizes 
good hiSloricaJ researcb. The move to change how we 
view ourselves and our forebears is pregnant with a 
political agenda. 

The claim held by those who are intent on historical 
revisionism is fundamentally an asertion that history 
is primarily political propaganda. 

No longer is history composed of fact or tnIth. It is a 
field of banIe on which to fight the political struggles 
of the present The assertion !hat history is merely 
subject to the vicissitudes of poIilicaJ whim is one !hat 
makes the enterprise of the historical revisionist a self-

The way this tountry's history _

Wouldn't you 
libtokoow 
that every time 
you have a 

Coke and a smile you're contribuling to 
lpIU1beid? Yes, comrades, the national 
soft drink of choice is very much a part 
of the South African economy. 

Knowing the whole truth about the 
Coca-CoJa company and others (I 
hope) would give you a different 
perspective on the even-sided 
approach to political issues. 

Women and people of color have 
been deceived with half-ll'Uths 
about the integrity of our ancestors, 
and an IItempI to tell some whole 
truths for once should not be held 
polilicaJly suspect. 

For those of you who feel that there 
is no need for revisionism since 
everyone's treated equally now, tell me 
why I spent \0 days on Jefferson in high 
school history and one day on Martin 
Luther King? 

Is it because the Declaration of _ 
Independence had such an effect on this 
courury that it outshines the accomplish-
rneolS of King'! Tell me civil rights 

. didn't rock Nixon's world. 

hal does 
spending one 
quarterofa 
Westem history 
Jesson on 
women and 
people of color 

and three quarters of it on white males 
do for a young woman of color1 

Certainly it does not convince her 
thai what her ancestors did is equally 
important to the accomplishments of 
our "founding fathers." 

It is no wonder that white males are 
the most successful individuals in this 
country - women and people of color 
would have jUSl as high of a success 
rate if they could only bave the same 
collective self-ateem. 

We· are not equal until we all feel 
equally as important. -

The"oId way" of teaching history is 
not always the correct way. Western 
history and the "Manifest Destiny" 
menaaJity may be glorious for white 
males, but for Native Americans who 
were systematically murdered and 
exploited for land, Manifest Destiny and 
the history of the Wesr is a far cry from 
glory. 

II you really want our history taught, 
then you have a moraJ obliption to 
make SUR: it is ta1J8hl truthfully, with the 
bad side toIdjust as thoroughly as the 
aood side. 

JeopIIIdizina the ideology of the 
"foundjng fathers" is whit's ac stake 
here, and so much opposition to 
alternative pom of view has me 
wonderina wllal you traditionalists are 
so afraid of hearina. and tr)'in& so 
desperarely to hide. 

The UCSD Guardian 

The heroes of yesteryear are now receiving new attention under 
historical revisionism's new perspective on the men who have 
shaped history and the modem world by their efforts. 

Shakespeare 
• The new historical revision 
takes no prisoners. 
Shakespeare's poetry and plays 
have been seen as little more 
than the product of another 
-dead white male." 

Uncoin 
• The president under whom 
the slaves of the South were set 
free is not a hero but is seen as 
a mere politician of the North 
that cynically set the slaves free 
in an effort to secure the 
political fruits in the war against 
the Confederacy. 

Columbus 
• Christopher Columbus is 
known for his voyage to the 
New World but this year's 500th 
anniversary of this event drew 
the criticism of those who see 
him as an imperialist and an 
oppressor. 

Jefferson 
• Once the man known for 
writing the words that declared 
the colonies free from the rule of 
King George III and asserted 
the equality of all men, 
Jefferson is now attacked for 
owning slaves. 

OPINION 5 

CON 
eonun..d from pep 4 
defeating one. 

We need nor leave the 20th century to 
see the last large scale use of historical 
revisionism to remedy the inequaJites 
inherent in history. 

Nazi Gennany was one of the regimes 
which made mincemeat of history to exall 
its heroes and condemn its enemies. This 
took place in the most educated country at 
thai time. Language and hiSlory were 
warped and reshaped for political ends. 
There was a mad drive to replace anything 
"European" with echtdeutsch or "pure 
Gennan." 

Communist countries used hiSlorical 
revision in order to study the correct 
hiSlory. The Communists lived in a world 
where history, despite Its "iron laws," was 
malleable. Seventy years passed with lies 
being taught in order 10 buttress the 
communist ideas of historical retribution. 

Let us not mistake the method used by 
these regimes. The reasons change, 
ostensibly, but the endeavor is the same. A 
history of lies is endured in the name of 
some higher justice or utopian ideal. 

II has already been noted that there is a 
positive historical revisionism. This is, of 
course, the normal operation of hislorians to 
know the facts and the forces that. molded 
the modem world when new facts or 
information are brought to light. Con-
versely, revision should not occur when 
new political exigenci~ demand. 

he danger with modem 
historical revisionism is that it 
is infused with a deadly sirain 
of polilical panisanship. It 
trains people 10 uphold their 
status as victims or oppressed 

peoples at the expense of understanding the 
blessings of West em thought and the 

uniqueness of Western liberty. This is not 
to discount the evils perpetrated in 
history. 

HiSlorical revisionism is an oppres-
sive idea in and of itself. It inclines 
people to see their lives as one more act 
in a brutal string of injustices. It causes 
people to segegrate themselves instead 
of bringing citizens together under a 
common love of liberty and freedom of 
ideas. 

The true tragedy of the historical 
revisionist's attempt to sell studenls the 
idea that Westem history is nOl·legiti-
mate for them because it mighl have 
excluded or mistreated them in the past 

is to miss one of the most unique aspects of 
Western thought - its capacity for 
dynamic change. In addition, the revisionist 
sows the seeds for continuing strife and 
conflict by emphasizing past struggles. 

ut to neglect to understand 
the tempest of conflicts 
which has characterized the 
history of man's existence on 
this planet is a mistake. If 
those who are enemies of the 

history of the West and the United States 
wish to be fair in reading a litany of 
grievances against Occidental history, they 
ought to realize the magnitude of the evils 

thac have always befallen civilization. 
What is unique about the Western 
hiSlory is it has the ability to view itself 
critically and even more remarkably, to 
comet itself. 

In addition, these critics of Western 
history are in an endeavor that is a 
uniquely Westem historical product. 

In fact, those who uphold 
Afrocentrism, one form of historical 

revisionism, will not find in history any 
love of the ideas of individuality and liberty 
thai have been born in the West and do not 
exist outside its aegis of thought. Life in 
Africa is not a utopia of understanding and 
tolerance. Africa is convulsed by murder 
and intertribal warfare with little irueresr

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Bennan's Column on cOlumbus Misses the PoInt 
Editor: 

Zachary Bennan' s commentary ("CoIum-
b4S-Bashers Seek to Malign the American 
Heritage," Monday, Oct. 14) was, to say the 
least, infuriatingly narrow-minded and suc-
ceeded in missing the entire "multicultural" 
point of revising education in die U.S. Berman 
feels that he has reached the pimacle of 
understanding regarding the Left. which in its 
"protest fever" has decided to discralit an 
otherwise noble man - Ouistopher Colum-
bus. 

That's right Zack, we're all just bomI silly 
and o\'erjoyed to have found such a wonderful 
scapeg08l to vent our trendy political anger 
on. And at the end of the week, we 'U lynch 
Oarence Thomas if we're not 100 busy with 
midtenns. 

The point of all this alleged "Columbus 
bashing" is not, as Berman assumes, to focus 
on the life of one man or 10 discredit "the 
triumph of human aspiration." It is, however, 
aimed at downgrading the triumph of white 
European male aspiralions to include the 
realilies of the rest of humanity, such as 
people of color, women and Native Ameri: 
cans. 

The idea of rethinking Columbus Day is to 
become aware of the multifarious nature of 
society on this continent in order to achieve 
true democracy, one in which aff voices re-
sound equally, not one in which only thefew 
have power. 

We need to realize·that the United States is 
not a homogeneous entity, but a vital mixture 
of individuals who have every right to be 
heard. regardless of race or gender. 

By misinterpreting the focus of the "1Wi-
Columbus Day" fervor as "multicultural ter-
mites gnawing at the foundation of American 

society," Berman, whose own background I 
need not mention, clearly overlooks the most 
crucial point of the day: what people, in fact. 
conslitute our American society.

Not All DIscrimination

I am writing regarding the apJWaIIlack of

Despile the tremendous gains of the '60s and

It is true that no person of color nor woman 
can "hide" his or her skin color or sex. Dis-
crimination on those bases is thus very easy to 
imagine. It is also true that sexual orientation 
can be "hidden" - oot shown to the outside 
world. But at what cost? 

Sexual orientation means more than just 
who you or I sleep with. It means who we find 
attractive, who we tend to make friends with, 
the kind of language we use, the kinds of 
everyday things we do. 

Sexual orientation can be "hidden" only 
by alienating a large portion of our lives. 
Imagine if all married people were forbidden 
to wear wedding bands and cany pictures of 
their loved ones and could oot say they'd 
spent the weekend "with my wife" or "with 
my husband." The world would be' a much

sadder - and tenser- pIKe. And yet, these 
are the kinds of restrictions lesbians, gay 
men and bisexual persons have to face every 
day. I contend thai sexual orieaDIion is not 
something that anyone would willingly 
~de;" it involves 100 much m a person's 
character and personality. 

Being "out of the closet" means not '11id-
m," sexual orientaIion anymore. Being out 
mea1S bem, free toexpmlS ouneIves as our 
whims direct us. 

It means beina true to ouneIves .-.d our 
friends. Unfortunately, the whims m lesbi-
MIS, py men ani bisexual persons differ 
from the "norm" and. thus, are subject to 
discriminaIion. 

Lesbians, py men and bisexual persons 
deserve - ani demand! -die ri", to be 
"out;" it is the only way we have of bem, 
ourselves and of being hIIppy. "Hiding" 
sexual orientation is an option only for the 
depraved. 

Yes, Matthew, a closeted py white male 
appears as only a white male, without refer-
ence to sexual orientalion. But he is suffering 
psychological torment and is not being h0n-
est with himself or anyone he oomes in 
contact with. Is he really gainl to be the 
superior candidate forajoboranything else? 
I think not. 

Oppression is oppression is oppression, 
no mailer what its fonq. Suggesting thar 
lesbians, gay ~ and bisexual persons 
should hide their orienIIIion and recum to 
their closets is like sugestin& persons m 
a>lor should bleach their skin and straipren 
their hair and is also like suggesting women 
should act just like men. It is wrOtlg and 
downright ugly.

Thunday, October U, 1991 

DECADE 
CGnIInI ............. 
Shamon has had the di..~ion of 
coaching one of only diree Division 
m crew teams in the country. Not 
much ofanhonor if you consider the 
opponents he has tQ.[ace as an alter-
native. Yet he has adapted to die 

levelof~petitiKKL 
"In the last 10 years, we have 

moved from competing regionally 
at the city level, to a more national 
level," Shannon said. "We have 
becorneextremely~petitiveover 
the last two to three years. " 

Shamon is up against a virtual 
wall of tradition. On the West Coast 
is the specter of Cal and its 120-year 
old crew team. On the East Coast 
are the Ivy Leagues with even stron-
ger traditions. 

Indeed. Shannon's only success 
has been in 1990 when his crew 
team won the San Diego Crew Clas-
sic. "'The quality of my team wiD 
always be walk-on quality," Shan-
non said. "We've never recruited." 
StiD, the policy seems to be work-
ing. "In the next five years, you'D be 
seeing us becoming dominant on 
the West Coast, breaking into the 
top six." 

Don't get the impression that 
everything has been peachy. The 
last 10 years has broughl its share of 

• SOlI! spots. Forwomen'ssoccerHead 
Coach Brian McManus, it's the 
rules. Literally, the rules on the field. 

McManus has never been shy 
about attacking the NCAA's repu-
tation for making up its own rules. 
"College rules have always been 
years behind Europe's and SO years 
behind everybody else's," McMa-
nus said. "There are silly rules in the 
works about only five players in the 
box on comer kicks and enlarged 
goals." 

Malone also has a complaint 
about the NCAA reduction of the 
size of the ball for women's compe-
tition. "I'm a basketball purist and 
would like to play by the same rules 
as the men." 

Sweet insists, though, that the 
NCAA has only involved itself with 
Division ill rules to clearly define 
financial aid limitations and limita-
tions on practice time. "All the c0n-
troversy in NCAA legislation cen-
ters around the how studtnts should 
spend their time. Oearly, they 
thought to keep gme students in the 
classroom." 

And over the last decade, as Di-
vision m has become more com-
petitive, the need for more practice 
has become inevitable. That, 
coupled with UCSD's increasing 
academic IqIUtation arKldemands, 
leaves many coaches caught be-
tween the proverbial rock. and its 
hard place. 

UCSDbaseball Head Coach Lyle 
Yates has seen the NCAA clamp 
down on theaggressivenessofbasc... 
ball. "You can't break up a double 
play anymore, since reckless slid-
ing is considered hazardous. There 
are now stiff penalties for brawls. 
The NCAA hasdefinitely gone over-
board with safety." 

Still, NCAA tinkering has also 
helped die UCSD alh1etic prognm1 
to pw inmensely. Some benefits 
include free playoff transportation 
and the opportunity for organized 
play for ~ schools thai can't 
otTer large scholarships. 

BoIh Malone and Tom Marshall, 
the men's lwkflbell heed coach, 
have capitalized on the dJRIe-poinl

line instituted in the mid-80's, par-
laying it into two tournament ap-
pearances for the men and a couple 
of near-misses for the women in the 
last two years. 

In all, Marshall has had six A11-
Americans in the decade, and is 
currently wolking on securing his 
third consecutive appearance in the 
NCAA tournament. Yet, he is a 
rarity among the Triton coaches in 
thai he is not overtly in favor of a 
move to Division D. "It's funny, but 
it really comes down to us finding a 
conference to fit into. Right now 
we're independent, so when itcomes 
down to the tail end of the season, 
we're left hanging for opponents. 
They're 100 busy with each other in 
conference play, trying to secure a 
spot in the regionals. " 

In fact, men's basketball is in a 
bit of a fix. You might consider the 
whole school too big for its britches. 
Over the decade, Marshall has been 
eyeing the SOAC, the only West 
Coast Division m conference. So 
far, the SCIAC has been loathe to let 
the wolf of UCSD into its fold of 
small private colleges. 

"Judy [Sweet] hasbeenwooong 
on it, but no cigar. There' sone other 
option and that's the CCAA, though 
it's limited to Division D teams 
only," Marshall said. "If it's the 
only way to get my team into a 
conference, then, yes, I would sup-
port a move to Division D." 

Indeed, the whole issue of Divi-
sion D and its eventual resolution 
will definitely affect the next 10 
years of UCSD athletics. Will the 
'90s bring • change from Division 
m to Division D, much as the early 
'lI(kbroughtonachangefromNAIA 
to Division m? Several UCSD 
coaches are hoping so. 

Dannevik is the most adamant 
supporter. "It's not so much the 
athletes. We're already playing Di-
vision I and D opponents. It's not a 
question of survival. I think we 
should make the move because of 
the coaches." 

The history of UCSD coaching 
has been spotty at best, with coaches 
walking in and out of a constantly 
revolving door. Only over the past 
five years has there been some sem-
blance of continuity. 

The decade before Division m 
saw coaches as pII1-time volunteers. 
Then as UCSD's repuIIItion arew, 
so did die permanency m its caech-
ing staff. Most coaches, however, 

are still doing a full-time job on a 
part-time salary. 

"Many coaches' wives have to 
wolk full lime to pay the bills," 
Dannevik said. "I'm only able to 
wor1c full-time because I'm also on 
the UCSD P.E. staff. But other 
coaches don't get the benefits or a 
decenl salary that should be there." 

Over the last decade, sports as a 
whole have become more competi-
tive, rule-heavy, and detailed, re-
quiring more and more time from 
individual coaches, Dannevik said 

"I see many coaches walking 
away, despite non-monetary ben-
efits," he said "'This banquet com-
ing up is great for recognition, but 
true recognition would be a move to 
Division D, which would provide 
for full-time coaches." 

The budget crunch has adminis-
trators hesitant to invest into Divi-
sion D, with its scholarship costs 
and coaches fees, little or no differ-
ence in student interest and conse-
quently, poor investment retum.ln 
short. UCSD would still be a long 
way from media-grabbing Division 
I stanIS, while still shouldering in-
creased costs for athletics. 

According to Judy Sweet, the 
decision on the move is out of her 
hands. There has been a committee 
fonned which will report to Assis-
tant Vice Chancellor Tom Tucker 
and Chancellor Richard Atkinson. 
"It's not an athletic depanmenl de-
cision,and whose it is, I don 'I know," 
Sweet said 

Malone pointed out that not all 
UCSD sports have a need to move 
to Division D. "Baseball and volley-
ball I can understand are running 
out of opponents and are facing an 
empty schedule. 

"[But women's basketball] has 
been striking the balance between 
level of competition and our level of 
skill," Malone said. 

Yates, however,thinks the need 
for a change is great. "RighI now, 
we have to [hold fundraisers] before 
the season starts just to raise travel 
money to get to schools that will 
play us." 

Yates is especially in favorofthe 
scholarship aspect of the Division II 
move. "Ever since I came to UCSD, 
the biggest problem isn'l finding 
good talent, but bringing them here 
- whether that means getting them 
past UCSD's rigorous academic 
entrance lfIQuirements or providing 
them with scholarship money."

Considerina the large amount of

receive from the U.S. military, Agee 
said it is probable thai there is a

UCSD administration and staff, 
however, denied that CIA infillnl-

According to Neil Murray of 
UCSD Caretr Services, "The CIA

Dannevik said that the Coyotes 
should have an advantage in 

SU'ength. 
"TIley're a physical tearn. 

TIley hit the ball very hard," he 
said. "We're more of a finesse 
team. 

"We have to do a real good

Dannevik added that the Tri-
tons. although not known as a 
blocking team. had their best 
blocking match of the yearTues-
day night against Point Lorna

When UCSD made the switch

gained more, according to Athletic

"Philosophically, we thought it

ua scoreless for Ibc remainder of 
lbepme. 

ua outshot UCSD 12-7. Triton 
pIie Michael M.dden had Ihree 
saves in Ibc winninl e«on. 

Monday's game Ipinst Biola 
was • Ieuon in IUikina early II1d 
striking quiet. Before the spec18-
tors had cleared their em of the 
rin&in8 from !be referee's whistle, 
UCSD walbead I ~ after forward 
Chris Hanssen scored 24 seconds 
inIo Ibc pme. 

It wa clear that Biola would be 
in for. Ions afternoon. Jusr12 min-
utes I.ter, Head Coach Derek 
Annstrong was already making 
mass substitutions in hope that his 
reserves could profit from some 
valuable playing time - if DOl by 
preserving the bd. then by boost· 
inatheirconfidencewithsome pis. 

'They did not leave Armstrong 
disappointed. Six minutes after en-
tering Ibc game, fresMw1Ken Fujii

meter position and the Tritons will 
need their entire brigade of swim-
mers to drop back. and help defend. 

As if Humbert wasn't enough, 
Cal also has a huge German whom 
the Tritons refer to only as "Dirt." 
By birth, his name is Dirk Zeien and 
by all reports, he is a powerful 
shooter and can be a definite threat 
to even the sttongest of defenses. 

But don't think thar the Bears' 
threat ends with their inside game. 
Quis Deding is a quick outside 
shooter who could give UCSD 
goalie Mike Warren more than his 
fair share of trouble should UCSD 
concentrate too intently on defend· 
ing the inside. 

Halper and the Tritons hope to 
counter with All-American Jason 
"Tunle" Brown, junior Kevin 
Vance, and freshman Mike Nalu. 
But even UCSO's big three will 
have their work cut out for them. 
Bears hole·guard Gaven Arroyo is

Offensive threats from Biola 
were few and far between. The 
Eagles' only resembIInce of an or-
cbesttaIcd aaack came when play-
ers made IonS runs into Ibc bean of 
Ibe Tria defense. MIdden bad • 
relatively easy day, save for one 
brief moment in the second half 
when Biola nearly capitalized on a 
mad scramble in front of the Triton 
p. 

Althoush always in control, 

considered one of the best defend-
ers in the country. Harpermaintains 
thai getting shots off from the two-
meter position could indeed tum out 
to be a di fflCUlI task. 

And even if Brown or Vance 
does get a shot off, they'd still have 
to get it past two of the best goalies 
in collegiate wilier polo. Cal splits 
time in thecagebetweenJim Wagrrer 
and Ludovic Salles. 

Facing thar kind of opposition is 
enough to make any team nervous. 
Yet Harper is never one to count his 
teamoutofagame. "We're going to 
take the John Wooden approach and 
just concentrate on ourselves," 
Harper said "\t's an honor to be in 
the pool with them, buI we're not 
going to let them intimidate us. " 

A key for UCSD will be the 
strength of its reserves. The Tritons 
know that a match-up against such 
big opponents will certainly lead to 
its shate of roughness. This is n0th-
ing new to UCSD, but Harperhopes 
to alleviate some of the pressure by 
frequently going to his bench.

Tbc UCSD Gurdiua 

UCSD still had ditficulty moumns 
an effective aaack. After more than 
SO minuIcs of ICOIdeu IMD, Jed 
Brintrenhoff senI a CI'OIS from Ibc 
rislll- which found its way to a 
wido-open Randy Cairns. Cairns 
pounded. shoe past Nandor, in the

closeOUlIbc pne.Amlitrolt.caIIed 
on his s&artcrs for the final five min-
utes of Ibc contest. 

They did DOl disappoinL Mike 
Lodoenand Ibnuen sec up a fader 
by Jame SIevenson. who cloledOUI 
Ibc scorina. 

The Trilons outshot the Eaa1es 
7-3 and, oombinaI with yesrerday'l 
win, boosced their JeCord 10 12-4, 
incmIsin& their chances of eamins 
• benh in the NCAA Division m 
tournament. After Monday's pme, 
Annstrong seemed confident of 
UCSO's c:bances. "Even if we tied 
the restofour games, we should still 
make the tournament," he said. 

With Arroyo defending Brown, 
Vance and Naluon Ibcinside, UCSD 
will also hope to create motion and 
draw ejections by driving through 
the middle. The Tritons six-on-five 
offense was a weak. spot earlier in 
the season, but Harper maintains 
!hal he has seen steady improve-
ment. 

Before tak.ins on the Bears, how-
ever, the Tritons will need to move 
past the SilverswordsofOlaminade 
University Wednesday afternoon. 
UCSO doesn't anticipate any 
lI'OUbIe, but Harper hopes his squad 
can maintain its intensity through-
out The contest will also sive Ibc 
Tritons' reserves a c:bance to wann 
up for lbunday's axIfest in which 
they will surely playa vital part. 

Brown should make a bit of per-
sonal his&ory on Wednesday. He 
tied UCSD's record for all-time 
goals scored last weelt apinst UC 
lrvine,equalinSthemarkof211 set 
by Tom Moore. Harper is looking 
for Brown to break the record as 
early as the fJJ'St quarter.

"She was really sick. She had a 
horrible stomach ache," Dlmevik 
said. Fabian made the path between 
Ibe gym and the bathroom a weII-
worn one, paying a visit to Poinl 
Lorna's porcelain throne between 
eacbpme. 

WbiIe Fibian wasn't feelins so 
hot on the inside, the rae oflbe team 
was struglingon lbeoutside. "E1iza-
beth Tan, Villi Van Duyne, Liz 
Vesanovic ... all of them had m0-
ments when they weren't quire 
right," Dannevik said. 

Pan of the problem might have 
been the Crusaders' rather Jarae 
gym. "[It's] a cavernous gym and 
we were having a lot of problems 
with our depth perception," 
Dannevik said. 

Still, wilhmotivalion,healthand 
abnormally large buildings stack.ed 
against them, the Tritons did man-
age to come back from 12-7 and 13-
8 deficits in the first two games. A 
major reason for thai was senior 

Dana Simone, who 10 this point has 
sone Jaraely unnoticedamidsc an of 
the Tritons' SUCCCII. 

"She's never a kill leader, but 
she's our best defensive player and 
always a steadyinS influence," 
Dannevik said. 

So, while Ibe others struggled to 
find some sort of groove, Simone 
held the ship Slelldy and UCSD was 
eventually able to pull away from 
the Crusaders' grasp. "She had her 
best maIdt of !be year," Dannevik 
said. 

Altbouah the maIdt goes down 
in the record books as yet another 
win, the entire nisht might have 
a'C8IICdmoreworriesforUCSDthan 
it solved. One potentially disastr'OlD 
trouble spoI is !be Tritons' \ack. of 
rnoIiv.aion. "I was thinking about 
thai [Tuesday night]," Dannevik 
said. ". might have to change wt. 
I've been doing a litrle bit Maybe 
make practice a bit more exciting 
and cballenge [!be players]." 

"We need to channel our inten-
sity better," he said. "Our fate is in 
our own hands. We're the best team 
in the nation. H we screw up, SOlI» 
body will be there to take advantaF 
of it."

J USTA FEW NOTES: • Boxing is stupid. Why? In lhe aftemwh of the mosl-
scrutinized rib, chest, upper-body 
region injury ever to hil the WBA-
C-F-HBO, it appears thai the 
Evander Holyfield-Mike Tyson 
fight will be delayed. 

As compensation, the 
Holyfield camp has offered up as 
replacements for Tyson the likes 
of Pierre Coetzer(reportedly, he 
was once the president of France), 
Alex Garcia and Larry Holmes. 
LArry Holnu!s? Good grief,they 
don 'I make Rocky movies this 
bad. 

Granted. it's probably just as 
well that Tyson can't fight . It just 
wouldn't do to have the heavy-
weight champion of the world 
making license plates in Aujca. 
His promoter ... now that 's 
another story. 

• How did those Einsteins in 
charge of umpiring manage to put 
Don Denkinger ("Yes, I was 
wrong") and Drew Coble ("No, I 
was not") in the same World 
Series? 

K ENT"T-R£.x" Hrtlek is all set for the World Wrestling 
Federation. He's got the nkk-
name. He's got the body. And 
now he's shown that he has the 
moves. 

Actually, all Hrbek was trying 
to do was win. 1be real goof on 
the play was Coble. who calJed 
Ron Gam out, and then a few 
inrungs later, reponedly asked the 
Braves' first-base coach what he 
thought of the call. 

You mean you weren't ure? 
• Sam Wyche and the 8engals 

are a tough team to figure out. 
How does a team with players like 
Boomer Esiason, James Brooks, 
Anthony Munoz stay winless? 
Precisely for that reason. Once 
upon a time, the 8engals were 
loaded with prime-time players: 
Tim Krumrie, Eddie Brown, 
David Fulcher, Ickey 
Woods ... their offensive talent, 
alone, was far-and-away superior 
to any team in the league. 

But those players have slipped. 
TIle only premier players left are 
Esiason, Brooks and Munoz. It's 
not that the other players are no 
longer any good: it's just they're 
no longer the superstars they once 
were. To replace them, Cincinnati 
is counting on the emergence of 
the likes of James Francis, Alfred 
Williams and Rickey Dixon - all 
great players in college. BUI how 
often does a great college player 
become a great pro player?

There exists a group of filmmakers who have mas-
tered the art of making blockbuster movies which attract 
masses of people looking for escape from their stress-
filled, dreary lives. John Sayles isn't one of them. Sayles 
is not a struggling, independent fibnmaker trying to 
break into the business with some new style or angle. He 
has been making critically-acclaimed feature films for 
more than 10 years, winning prestigious awards and 

gaining recognition at film 
festivals and in critics' cor-
ners. He has consistently 
attracted the most talented 

of actors and actresses for 
his films, most of whom 
have made. their names in 
commercially successful 

movies. He has previ-
ously made six films, all 
dealing with specific 
social issues, detailed 
brilliantly with a care-
ful eye and told in the 
voice of a great story-
teller.

TIley " tell stories, weave vi uaf 
marvels with theirelecrrifying, tyl· 
ish, sexy choreography and costum-
ing, and - most importantly -
with their professionally polished 
dancing that can leave you breath-
less", is how George C. Buse of the 
Windy City Timesdescribed lheGus 
GiordanoJazzDanceChicago. This 
intemationaitouringdance company 
will be perfonning at USCD in the 
Mandeville Auditorium at 8 p.m. 
tomorrow. 

The Gus Giordano Jazz Dance 
Chicago (GGJDC) was founded by 
none other than Gus Giordano, who 
is not only a dancer, but also a 
teacher, choreographer, author and 
artistic director. Giotdano started 
the company because he wanted to 
make jazz dance more popular and 
mainstream. 

Giordano has shared his talents 
with all fonnsofmedia. from televi-
sion to books. He received three 
awards, an Emmy, the PBS and 
Ohio State Award, for the 1980 
television production of The Re· 
hearsal. Giordano was also thecho-
reogrdpher for the award-winning 
film " The Music Box". In the area 
of theater. Giordano was one of six 
choreographers for the 1988 Chi-
cago revival of the Broadway musi-
cal Hair. Giordano also wrote a 
booIc about his favorite form of dance 
called Anthology of American Jazz 

HIATUS H3 

DUllce, which was the first book of 
its kind. 

InanissueofFraNoi,Giordano 
explained, "In jazz, you·re work-
ing in different idioms all the time. 
TIle thing you have to realize about 
jazz is that it's not a basic art fonn 
(like ballet or modem dance). It 's 
like America - you take from a lot 
of an fomls; it's an amalgam of art 
fonns." 

The GGJDC has not only per-
fonned for audiences throughout 
the United States, but it has also 
perfonned around the world in 
countries like Russia, Gennany, 
France, Italy. the Bahamas. Canada 
and Japan. 

According to Buse, "The dance 
routines contain echoes of many 
fonns from classic ballet to Martha 
Graham's modem dance to Broad-
way musical comedy- but it is all 
jazzdancing, pulsaring, syncopated. 
innovative- whether choreo-
graphed ballads. bee·bop , 
boogaloo, or the driving beat ofthe 
1950' s and early rock." 

This year there will be ix sets of 
dance variations in the concert. TIle 
six will include Chameleoll, origi-
nal score by Rocky Moffit, choreo-
gmphedby Sam Watson; Sillg. Sillg. 
Sing, music by Benny Goodman, 
choreographed by Gus Giord.lno; 
Saka, music by Wally Bandorou 
and Black Box, choreographed by 
Keith Anthony R. Cross; Saskia,

Harlan Schiffman, owner of the

likely to follow in the footstepS of 
BiD Graham or BiD SilvL Instead of 
promoting and publicizing bands 
like MadonnaorTiffany ,he'll bring 
underground groups like Nirvana or 
Dinosaur Jr. into town. And in a

it's nice that Fmeline EnIcI1ainmenI

Fmeline Entertainment puIS on 
shows primarily II Iguana's in 
Tijuana, although it also uses the 
Casbah, Sound FX and Winter's 
Red Tape. The focus of the music is 
mainly alternative and metal, with 
some hard rock and speed metal on 
occasion. For any a1temalive music 
fan, Schiffman's job seems ideal. 
He Jets the opportunity to pnxnoce 
the bands thai he enjoys and that he 
believes have potential. How many

Chili Peppers/Bunhole Surfers gig 
last year, tend to get out of hand. 
That 's pari of Iguana's chann, and 
pan of what makes it such a great 
place to see a show. 

When asked about the safety 
factor, Schiffman responded, "Es-
sentially, the adrenaline level is re-
ally high. The last thing I ever want 
to see is someone get injured or 
maimed at a concen. But if you 
have an individual who has a death 
wish and wants to jump off that 
balcony, and by chance someone 
moves out of the way and they land 
on the concrete floor - they are 
going to get hun." 

Schiffman continued, "I don't 
advocate the consumrtion of alco-

going down there, it's an adventure. 
You couple that ad\'~nture with live

When asked about his shows, 
Schiffman said, "I can't say I'm

some money, bUll'm helping the

ously, in these cases I'm not being

Whether he's being altruistic or 
not, the upshot is that Fineline brings 
to town some of the best alternative 
bands, and won't rob music fans 
with upscale ticket prices. Tonight, 
Schiffman is bringing Seattle power

When ex-Band member Robbie 
Robertson setOUlIO makeStoryville. 
his second solo album, he probably 
realized he had a hard act to follow. 

Robertson 's self-titled solo de-
but album was a critic:aJ success. 
most of which could be laid on the 
shouldersofproducerDanieILanois. 
whoalsoproducedU2's TMJoshua 
Tru and Peter Gabriel's So. 

On Sloryville, named after a sec-
tion of New Orleans, Robertson 
proves that Lanois wasn't the only 
reason for the first albun),s bril-
liance. " 

While it's clear thal Robertson 
has picked up some oJ Canois' pro-

., 

duction sry\es, SJoryv;lI~ mixes the 
aImOIpheIechnc:leaialicofLlnois' 
producdonl willi down-home New 
0rIeMs flavor. 

Like the IasI album. which fea-
t~ contributions by U2 and Gab-
rid. Sloryville has ils shire of aU-
5QIr appearances. Guest shots by 
Bruce Hornsby and Aaron Neville 
help give the album a panicularly 
American voice and texture. 

But Ihe best texture is provided 
by Robertson's p1Ivelly voice. His 
vocal presence isCOf1'1l1llll1dia when 
he sinp. And Robertson draws lis-
teners in fwther as he drops into a 
hoarse whisper. 

Throughout Storyville. Roben-
son is perfonningan incredibly com-
plex balancing' act. He uses guitar 
pans reminiscent of U2' s Edge and 
Motown-style horns in the same 
songs. His uses explicitly OIristian 
symbols and explicitly sexual im-
agery. 

In the end, though, Robenson 
doesn't falter. The songs on SIo-
ryvill~ are supposed to be bound by 
a unifying theme: the ciry of New 
Orleans. 

It·s a stretch to fit some of the 
songs into the concept. but the great 
hooks in "Day of Reckonin," and 
"What About Now," and the ~ 
tiona\ power of "Hold Back the 
Dawn" and "Rainbow" make up for 
the discontinuity. 

So the good news is that Sto-
ryville is an album that manages to 
be intelligent, fun and moving all at 
the SII1lC time. 

The bad news for Robbie R~ 
ertson is that, when it comes time for 
his third album. he'lI once again 
have a hard act to follow.

Repriw 

24 NiXhls is an uninspirin, col-
lection of Eric Clapton's greatest 
hits. Recorded live. the 1.5 tracks 
wlllder through OaplOn's career. 
From "Sunshine of Your Love" to 
"Pretending, .. 24 Niflhls covers all 
the bases. 

Though the album boasts a num-
ber of imprasive musicians. the 
soood remains relatively constant 
throughout the entire album - with 
C\apton's ,uitar ringing with his 
familiar sounds and lines. 

Such grears as Buddy Guy, Rob-
ert Cray, Jil1ll1lie Vaughn. Ray C<» 
per. Phil Collins, and the National 
PhjJhannonic Orchestra grace vari-
ous tracks. TIle album also claims 
that there are no overdub5 or fixes. 
which is quite impressive for hav-
ing so many musicians in a live 
setting. 

The production value is great, 
but then Eric Oapron wouldn't re-
lease it if it didn't sound good. He 
may just be going through the m0-
tions these days, but if you're an 
avid Oapcon fan. 24 Nighrs may be 
vital to your collection.

There are times when being able to get the answer isn't 
enough. Sometimes, like midterms, understanding the 
question and recognizing the solution becomes. more a 
matter of speed. Working with Schaum's Outhnes 
prepares you for the rapid recognition of problems and 
solutions. The more problems you solve and the more 
ways you see how to solve the problem, the more 
confidence and ability you will bring with you to

tunately for the twooflhem, and the 
baaIe continues to the bitter end. 

The characters in Ihis movie are 
exaggerated American stereotypes 
lacking my depth - but the inter-
play between them is the real gem of 
the fibn. The power-playing between 
the female lawyer and the million-
aire is amusing. but I found the 
discussions between Lawrence and 
Jorgenson and Lawrence and Coles 
to be more meaningful and real. 
Jcqenson is a tradition-oriented, 
New Deal American arguing about 
morality to a corporate millionaire 
concerned wilh dollar values re-
gardless of the consequence. Coles 
has strived for years to climb up the 
small business ladder as a manager, 
but as the ladder begins to fall out 
from under him, he turns to the 
millionaire for approval of his new 
Orne-first' attitude. 

Danny Devito is offensive and 
funny (as usual) and Gregory Peck 
plays a stuffy, rural businessman 
convincingly. The acting is good 
overall, although I found Penelope 
Ann Miller's perfonnance lacking 
dimension. 

This movie gains an almost sur-
real imagery by showing the sexual 
game between Kate and Lawrence 
as the forum for deciding the fate of 
an industrial town and the lives of its 
many workers. The non-judge-
mental manner in which the movie 
deals with ironies and the incompat-
ibilities of its characters increases

both albums and had the half-full 
amphitheater bobbin , and groovin'.

On this tour they pay homage to 
Ministry, having "Pudding Time" 
change iJVo ''Thieves.'' and then back
