yearly winter festival 
By JOSIPH'UI 
Hiatus Editor 

Winterfest is the biggest festival at 
UCSD that isn't named "Sun God: 
and it has gradually grown to invite 
bands that tend to have small but very 
strong fan bases. 

UCSO's first Winterfest In 1998 
capitalized on the ska and sWing 
revival, bringing the Dance Hall 
Crashers, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and 
Goldfish to town . 

The lineup fo r the follOWing year 
was successful with the popularity of 
one-hit wonders Digi tal 
Underground, and the past-their-
prime Violent Femmes and 
Southern-California-act World Tribe. 
They were able to carry the show with 
the anticipation of Digital 
Underground's "The Humpty 
Dance" and the enduring quality of 
"Blister in the Sun" by the Femmes. 

Buck-o-Nine, Ozomatli and 
Coolio came to last year's Winterfest 
with the power of a small but strong 
following that fueled the energy of 
the show.

By MAlT SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

UC President Richard C. Atkinson proposed 
dropping the SAT I as a criterion for applying to 
UC schools. citing the test as an unfair assess-
ment of the abilities of students. 

"The SAT I is problematic because it does 
not cover what is learned in a high school cur-
riculum: said UC spokesman Brad Hayward. 
"The SAT measures the student's test taking 
abilities." 

As a result of such criticism regarding the 
SAT, Atkinson has proposed to restructure the 
application process so that students will no 
longer submit their SAT I scores. Instead, high 
school grade point averages in UC-approved 
classes and SAT /I scores would be lhe two 
major parts of the apphcation and w uld deter-
mine a student's acceptance. 

Atkinson suggested thaI a new, fairer stan-
dardized test be developed, but recommended 
thaI lhe SAT II be used until such a teSI has 
been made. 

In his Feb. 18 speech al the Annual Meeting 
of the American Council Education, Atkinson 
said that the SAT I is no longer a valid indicator 
of success in college. 

"We know that high scho I grades are by far 
the best indicator of first-year college perfor-
mance," he said. "We have also found that the 
SAT II is a better predictor of performance than 
the SAT L" 

A 1996 study, on the other hand, showed 
that 82 percent of students who had over a 
1,300 on their SAT I graduated college within 
five years, while only 74 percent of the students 
who scored between 1200 and 1299 graduated 
within the same time frame. 

UCSD's Assistant Vice Chancellor Richard 
Backer said that this proposed policy would not 
impact UCSD to a large degree, as the impor-
tance ·of standardized tests in admissions deci-
sions has al ready been decreasing for the last

Navidad Vtrus Sent Out by UCSD Visual Arts Server 
Some students received hundreds of e-mails containing the virus through Outlook Express 
By RIIICCA WOOD 
Senior Staff Writer 

Earlier this week the "Navidad" 
virus was unintentionally sent via 
e-mail to hundreds of students on 
a visual arts mailing list. The e-
mai l's subject line read "Grad 
Show!" and contained the 
attached file navidad.exe, which is 
a virus that distributes itself 
through address books in 
Microsoft Outlook Express. 

According to ResNet 
Coordinator Erik Strahm, when 
downloaded. the virus prevents 
any application from running. 

"When the user tries to open 
an application. a screen pops up 
with a smiley face.· Strahm said. 
"Fortunately. computers ,infected 

,1.' 

with the virus are 100 percent 
repairable. " 

Nich Ziesmer, senior residen-
tial computing consultant, 
explained that the outbreak was 
completely random. 

"It is pure chance that the 
UCSD sender got the virus: 
Ziesmer said. 

Strahm said that the Navidad 
virus that was sent to people on 
the visual arts list did not originate 
on campus. 

"Usually someone creates the 
virus somewhere else and almost 
all viruses are from other coun-
tries: Strahm said. He added that 
the UCSD sender did not inten-
tionally propagate the virus. 

"Microsoft Outlook Express is 
very ~usccptible to viruses because 

the vi ruses can piggy-back them-
selves on the files the system uses: 
Ziesmer said. 

He also said that computer 
viruses spread like viruses in 
humans and can be designed to do 
almost anything. He said the 
Navidad virus is very well-
designed. 

"It's practically ingenious: he 
said. "It readily distributes itself to 
millions of computers. It is unfor-
tunate how effective the virus is: 

The Navidad virus is one of 
many viruses that have been 
spreading around campus. The 
"Snow White" and "Romeo and 
Juliet" viruses are some of the oth-
ers. 

Ziesmer said the best way for 
people ·to p.rote~t their c~,:"puters 

from viruses is to buy an anti-virus 
program such as Norton 
AntiVirus. He said another prob-
lem is that people do not keep 
their anti-virus programs updated. 

Ziesmer added that students 
who read their e-mail though pop-
maiLucsd.edu or tel net are at less 
risk, because file attachments will 
not be opened automatically, as 
they sometimes are in older ver-
sions of Microsoft Outlook 
Express. . 

"Look twice before opening 
files: Ziesmer said. He explained 
that students should be cautious 
about opening files from senders 
they do not know.

The new California Spatial Reference Center, 

which uses Global Positioning System technolo-
gy to monitor California 's environment, was ded-
icated Monday at its headquarters at the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 

There are more than 40 organizations that 
will use the center, including the Cecil H. and Ida 
M. Green Institute of Geophysics and Planetary 
Physics at Scripps, Caltrans, the California Land 
Surveyor's Association, the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California, the U.S.

Frank Powell, UCSD professor of physiology 
and director of the University of California's 
White Mountain Research Station, has orga-
nized a program to study the effects of high alti· 
tude on humans and the environment. Mountain 
research has significant implications for heart 
and lung diseases. Powell and his colleagues 
presented their findings at the annual meeting of 
the Association for the Advancement of Science 
Feb. 18. 

Powell and his fellow researchers study 
hypoxia, a factor that limits humans' oxygen 
intake at high altitudes, and their findings may 
lead to treatment for people who suffer from 
hypox ia at sea level as a result of heart or lung 
disease.

Virus: 
There has been no 
reported computer damage 

There have been no reponed 
actual costs or damage to comput-
ers infected with the Navidad virus 
on campus yet, other than the time 
spent removing the virus because 
pepple were temporarily unable to 
use their computers. 

Make the 1I1f/TIl 
lem with viruses is that they grow 
exponentially when they are dis-
tributed through mailing lists. 

Students whose computers have 
a virus or have problems .should 
call the ResNet office at (858) 822-

through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 8 
p.m., and Friday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 

T1lIJ>E .,DI. 
Strahm said that although virus-

es are already commonly found on 
campus residential computers, 
there has been an increase in the 
last few weeks. Two years ago, the 
"Melissa" virus infected computers 
and was the most devastating virus 
on campus, Strahm said. 

SAT: 
OVer 300 universities have 
made the.SAT optional 
C.Aud f'roIII PIP 1 
two years . 

For the last two years, admission 
to UCSD has been. based 60 per-
cent on high school GPA and 40 
percent on standardized tests. This 
is a change from three years ago 
when the percentages were equal at 
50-percent each. 

[n recent years, the test has fallen 
under close scrutiny, and many 
believe it is culturally, sexually and 
economically unfair. 

Statistics from the 1 ~98 test 
show that males on average per-
form 42 points better on the exam 
than females, despite females' gen-

eral better performance in high 
school and higher graduation rate 
than males. 

The SAT is also under scrutiny 
because many believe it is unfair to . 
students from low-income families 
that cannot afford private tutoring. 
Atkinson said last year that about 
150,000 students paid over $100 
million to companies such as IVY 
West and Kaplan that charge as 
much as $750 per student for.ser-
vices. 

"These changes will help all stu-
dents - especially low-income and 
minority students - determine 
their own educational destinies: 
Atkinson said. 

If passed by the UC Regents, 
the proposal will go into effect dur-
ing the 2003 school year. Backer 
said there is a strong possibility 
that this will happen.

SAT I No Longer 
Adequate to Deter-
mine Success 

Many people realize that the process for 
admitting students to the University of Cal-
ifornia discriminates against impoverished 
students from less-privileged socioeconom-
ic backgrounds or disadvantaged schools. 

In an attempt to level the playing field for 
such students, UC President Richard Atkin-
son is ready to unveil a plan that will elimi-
nate SAT I scores from UC admissions cri-
teria . 

In a day when expensive preparatory 
courses promise to raise students' scores by 
hundreds of points, the Guardian feels that 
Atkinson's move is a smart one that will 
keep students from buying their way into 
the UC system. At the very least, his plan 
'will reduce applicants' use of personal 
finances as a way of developing advantages 
over students whose financial circum-
stances do not allow them to enroll in 
expensive preparatory courses. 

In addition, eliminating the outdated 
standardized exam wiU allow students who 
come from below-par high schools to have 
a better chance at gaining admission to the 
college of their choice. 

Importantly, Atkinson's proposal is not 
one that eliminates standardized tests alto-
gether. Instead, it proposes that UC admis-
sions boards continue to take into account 
SAT II test scores, because these are 
believed to be a better measure of what stu-
dents have learned in high school. 

For example, the SAT II contains diverse 
subjects such as English, math, history, 
social studies, science and languages. All of 
these are areas of study that college stu-
dents typically encounter in their majors 
and general education requirements, 
whereas the SAT I is highly generalized and 
reflects only two possible subjects. Atkinson 
has argued that because the SAT II is based 
on many subjects that are often included in 
university curricula, it is a better indicator 
of how a student will perform in college. 

The university currently admits 60 per-
cent of its students based solely on grade 
point averages and SAT scores. The remain-
ing 40 percent are admitted after a review of 
supplemental information, such as personal 
statements, letters of recommendation and 
extracurricular activities. 

The Guardian realizes that simply drop-
ping SAT scores will not completely level 
the playing field for underprivileged stu-
dents, but we feel that Atkinson's plan is ' a 
positive move and deserves our support.

Despite Previous Bouts, Ariel Sharon 
Can Bring Peace to Middle East 

New conservative Israeli leader has created a unity government and can force a 
peace with Yasir Arafat on Israel's tenns 

By AllAN tWA 
Senior Staff Writer 

It's been less than a month since Ariel 
Sharon was elected prime minister of 
[srael in the special elections held Feb. 6, 
and he has already made a remarkable 
effort to assemble a unity government. Ini-
tially many opponents, especially those on 
the left and Palestinians, were wary of the 
old general's intentions and his historical-
ly controversial and hawkish actions. 

Sharon is head of [srael's Likud party, 
the more conservative of Israel's two 
main political parties. Though the Likud 
want peace just as strongly as their Labor 
counterparts, they are more determined 
to keep the Israeli borders in their pre- -
sent form, especially those of Jerusalem. 

Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak is 
head of the Labor party, which is consid-
ered the more liberal of the two main 
parties, and he is willing to make I~rger 
concessions in the name of peace. It is 
this fundamental difference that brought 
Sharon to power in the recent election 
and it is this issue that most stringently 
divides the people of [srael. 

It is also this difference in opinion that 
makes it so amazing that following the 
election, Sharon offered an outstretched 
arm to the defeated Barak, offering him the 
position of defense minister in his Cabi-
net. Furthermore, the proposed unity gov-
ernment would have Simon Peres, former 
prime minister and Labor party leadet, as 
its foreign affairs advisor. 

Both are highly coveted and powerful 
positions in the prime minister's Cabi-
net. If President George W. Bush had 
asked Bill Clinton to be his attorney gen-
eral and Gore to be secretary of state, 
imagine the implications. 

Originally I was staunchly against 
Sharon becoming prime minister, because 
Sharon has historically been anti-peace, 
not to mention he is violently disliked by 
the Palestinian and Arab communities. 

In 1982, Sharon was responsible for 
sending a group of Christian militiamen 
into Lebanon, where they went on a ram-
page and slaughtered ~ many as 2,()()() 

Palestinians. Sharon was absolved of 
responsibility for this, but it is clear that he 
had prior knowledge that the militiamen 
were capable of such atrocities. 

More recently, Sharon visited the Tem-
ple Mount, or the al-Haram aI-Sharif, as it 
is known to Muslims. Because of this visit 
he has been accused of provoking the cur-
rent uprising. However, since he has beer. 
elected, Sharon has taken steps to ensure 
that his landslide victory will continue to 
receive the approval of the finicky Israeli 
constituents. 

Mainly, Sharon's decision to form a 
true. unity government has shocked 
many people worldwide. More impor-
tantly, it has impressed everyone. To me, 
this seems to be the only reasonable 
option available to the Israeli people. 
Under Likud rule, the peace process 
sto:rped completely, increasing hostility 
an anger in the region. 

On the other hand, Barak offered 
more land than almost anyone wanted to 
give, and Arafat still said no. With both 
sides unsuccessful in solidifying a peace 
treaty with the Palestinians, and with the 
Israeli people anxious for peace yet dis-
appointed with the process, perhaps a 
unified government will be able to pro-
duce a peace treaty that can satisfy both 
the hard-liners and the liberals. 
. ~~aron is h~rdly . a compromising 
IIldlvldual to beglll With, so any line he 
draws is sure to be stood behind, which 
sends the message to the Palestinian and 
Arab world that Israel is not going to be 
toyed with anymore. 

But by giving Barak and Peres such 
powerful positions, he has shown a will-
ingness to bring peace to the region, an 
action that will definitely be noted by 
Arafat and other Arab leaders. When 
Sharon won the election, I'm positive that 
Arafat all but gave up on the peace 
process. With a unity government peace 
seems possible, but Arafat will have to play 
by a new set of rules. It was a slap in the 
face of every Israeli when Barak conceded 
so much of [sraeli [and in the name of 
peace, and Arafat promptly rejected the 
offer. Arafat will never get an offer like that 

again, and he will be forced to rethink 
some of his more controversial requests. 

Logically, [ fear that this may lead to 
an impasse, with Arafat asking for parts 
of Jerusalem that Bara~ previously 
promised, and Sharon unmoving in his 
decision to keep Jerusalem whole. But [ 
have hope that this election has been a 
wake-up call to many Palestinians - a 
message has been sent that [srael is not 
going to bend over backward, and results 
must be sho..yn before any treaty is 
signed. With Barak, Sharon sends the 
message that peace is desired, but the 
rules have changed: Israel will not be 
pushed around. 

The coming weeks will be very telling. 
At the time this article was written, 
Sharon's coalition with the Labor party 
had not been solidified and Barak was 
still prime minister. [f Sharon cannot 
form a unity government with the Labor 
party, he may resort to forming an 
alliance with the Shas party, Israel's reli-
gious party, which is more adamantly 
against giving land for peace than the 
Likud party. This action would most 
likely bring the progress of the peace 
process to a snail's pace, if not a com-
plete halt. It would also unintentionally 
send the message that Israel does not 
want peace. This would be a terrible set-
back in the peace process, which has 
progressed so far in the.past half decade. 

Sharon has 45 days from the day he 
was elected to form a government. Under 
Israeli law, if he has not formed a govern-
ment, a special election must be called, 
and a re-vote.will occur, sening the peace 
process even further back. The Likud 
party, together with the Labor party, 
would be a veritable yin and yang in the 
prime minister's office. 

As long as Sharon's offer is emblem-
atic of his desire for peace and unity 
among the Israeli people, there is a pos-
sibility of a satisfied [sraeli public and a 

~nable peace treaty in the coming 
years. For now, peace is still a dream, and 
I hope that all parties involved are willing 
to make compromises and stick by their 
promises.

America's International Actions 
Brings Doubt to Patriotism 

No 
Angel 

ANGElA CARRIER 

Sometimes I wonder about being an American citi-zen. I don't always feel the 
pride that I think I should feel. 
Hearing the national anthem 
doesn 't fill me with patriotic fer-
vor. I prefer meeting people from 
other countries rather than my 
fellow Americans. 

I fully appreciate the rights 
and privileges that I have in 
America. Yet, sometimes I cringe 
upon learning of our govern-
ment's actions. 

I am most concerned with 
our country's role in internation-
al affairs. In many instances, I am 

~ot educated enough to take a . 
Side and may not have a full 
understanding of the problems, 
but I know enough to question 
what goes on. Some problems in 
this world have no sure, noncon-
troversial solutions, but it is pos-
sible to reduce U.S. involvement. 

In a recent article '1 read, the 
Bush administration discussed 
its stance on Iraq. The Bush 
team was split on . strategy and 

ucsd 

the degree of support the United 
States should give to forces 
opposing Saddam Hussein. 

Some wanted an aggressive 
strategy to oust Hussein, while 
others were for a more moderate 
strategy of sanctions and limited 
support for the opposition 
groups. It seemed it would be a 
while before a consensus could 
be reached, but less than a day 
after the article was published, 
the United States was leading air 
strikes against Iraq. Was this the 
proper decision for us? 

The opposition forces wanted 
and needed the support from us, 
but should we have given it to 
them? What position are Ameri-
cans in now? Air strikes are ter-
rifying. During air strikes on Bel-
grade, my Yugoslavian friend was 
in the United States and her 
family stayed behind, scared and 
vulnerable. Such fear is 
unknown to me and most other 
Americans. Walking around at a 
posh university, it is difficult to 
understand the magnitude of the 
situation. 

Regardless, it is understood 
that decisions must be made by 
our government that gravely 
affect the rest of the nation, and 
the world for that matter. But 
one must at least question those 
decisions. It is too idealistic to . 

think dramatic change can come 
instantly. World peace will not 
exist tomorrow, but there can be 
more serious effort to move in 
that direction. 

Does the United States need 
to be part of every world con-
flict? There will never be a con-
sensus on any issue involving 
international affairs, and U.S. 
involvement may perpetuate the 
problems. But then the United 
States also does a lot to support 
those in need. 

The "world police force" (the 
U.S. military) will be called often, 
but it does not have to respond 
the same way every time. To what 
extent will the involvement of 
the United States help the prob-
lem, and to what extent will we 
add to it? 

I don't want the rest of the 
world to glare at the policemen 
and muner "pig" when they pass, 
but it already happens now. 

My concern is that our gov-
ernment's decisions are seen by 
the rest of the world as represen-
tative of U.S. citizens, and I hate 
that. Even if one should think to 
openly oppose the decisions of 
the government, the shouts of 
that citizen are lost in the roar of 
the governing power.

OPINION 5 

NATO is Still Needed 
Despite the EU's Presence 
By MARY ONEUA ES1'UDiLLO 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

After the Cold War, many 
believed NATO was dead. After 
all, the Russians are no longer a 
threat and the Cold War is over. 
Many wonder why the all iance is 
still around and criticize NATO's 
presence in recent crises in Bosnia 
and Kosovo. Many say that the 
alliance is a military organization 
with no political concerns whatso-
ever. 

NATO has always been misun-
derstood: The alliance is more 
important now than ever before. 
While we no longer have to worry 
about doomsday scenarios that 
were the reason for NATO's for-
mation, the alliance is striving to 
make the "best case" scenario. 

The purpose of the alliance has 
always been to maintain the status 
quo and form solidarity against 
the Soviet threat. But the status 
quo is no longer on the agenda; 
NATO has survived because of its 
ability to respond to change. This 
versatility is why the alliance is an 
important and relevant part of not 
only Northern European security, 
but global security as well. 

To understand the importance of 
NATO's presence, one must look at 
the overall effects of its current 
operations. But first, the misconcep-
tions of what NATO is and what it 
stands for must be dispelled. 

The most common misunder-
standing is that NATO is merely a 
military alliance. Like the alliances 
that started wars before NATO's 
establishment, NATO is seen as a 
gang of countries that pledge sup-
port for each other should any 
member encounter a hostile situa-
tion with a nonmember country. 
NATO is more than just a military 
alliance or a counterthreat to war-
ring countries. It is a community of 
nations, striving to foster security 
and peace throughout not only its 
member countries, but other coun-
tries as well. . 

Another myth is that the 
alliance's purpose is not limited to 
keeping the status quo. Much to 
the contrary, NATO's purpose has 
changed as often as the political 
climate in most countries has 
changed . NATO's goals change 
from defending its member coun-
tries against nuclear threats to 
proactively fostering security. 

The most important point in 
NATO's current agenda is part-
nership. As a basic element to 
European stability, NATO has 
founded the Partnership for Peace 
Program and Euro-Atlantic Part-
nership Council. Many critics do 
not know about this council, 
which boasts 46 member coun-
tries. Among them are NATO 
members, former Warsaw Pact

jackson's Inaugural Absence Welcome 
By RYAN DARBY 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Inauguration Day 2001, when 
Republicans rejoiced after eight 
years of Clinton ian despotism, was-
n't without its problems. An intrud-
er shaking the new president's 
hand, a protest along Pennsylvania 
Avenue, biting cold weather, and 
Ricky Manin all put a damper on 
the otherwise joyous occasion. 

One thing, however, made it 
especially delightful : Jesse Jackson 
was nowhere in sight. 

Of course, jackson spent the day 
"reconciling with his fami ly in an 
undisclosed location" - i.e. hiding 
from the media - because of the 
child he fathered out of wedlock. 

S me people were surprised, 
and others were shocked,. yet 
some of us already knew that 
Ja kson is human slime. We must 
go far beyond his affair, to when 
he was acting as Bill Clinton's 
"spiritual advisor," for us to see his 
true colors. 

Let's examine his status as 
"reverend." This is a taboo topic, 
because jackson has no congrega-
tion to speak of and no church to 
name. His only following is the 
faceless string of protesters who 
trail him wherever he wanders. 
Apparently, he is a self-proclaimed 
minister who uses his ti tle to 
immunize himself from all the 
steep, unfounded allegations he 
wields like a sword. 

The protests and allegations 
immediately fo llowing the presi-
dential election were just the latest 
examples of Jackson's preposter-
ous behavior. Think about it. 
Shortly after AI Gore retracted his 
concession, Jackson arrived in 
West Palm Beach, Fla. with hun-
dreds of protesters. Whether Jack-
son and his protesters had been 

briefed on the object of their 
protest is unknown; all that is 
clear is that they were ready for 
action and eager to cause trouble. 

I was shocked when I woke up 
that morning. It was as though the 
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse 
had arrived in Florida. There were 
protests everywhere, there were 
ci tizens who claimed they voted 
for the wrong candidate, there 
were minorities angry because 
they were turned away from 
polling booths, there were people 
calling for a revote, and every 
reporter in the country flocked to 
participate in that ci rcus. They 
were also mad about some guy 
named Chad. It was a nightmare. 

George W. Bush won the elec-
tion fai r and sq uare. The voters, 
the Florida legislature, the U.S. 
Supreme Court, Congress, time 
and the Constitu tion have already 
established that firm ly. What I find 
curious, however, is how Action 
jackson and his fan club arrived in 
Florida so quickly. They had mere 
hours to mobilize and organize, 
but they did, and they did it well . 

The Democrats were building 
this stonn before any electora l votes 
had been called for either candi-
date. With thousands of Floridian 
Democrats angrily claiming to have 
voted for Pat Buchanan - even 
though most of them had, in fact, 
voted fo r Gore - this was defin ite-
ly a battleground ripe for the pick-
ing for Jesse "Rent-a-Mob" Jackson. 

That's right: "Rent-a-Mob" is 
my favorite nickname for Jackson . 
I don't believe he has ever worked 
a day in his life. All he does is 
protest. How do you think he 
supports himself and his family? 
Through protesting. How can you 
possibly respect a professional 
protester? And as I mentioned 
earlier, he's always ready fN 

action, and he certainly loves pub-
licity. You need an angry mob to 
protest something? Call Jackson: 
He's always open for busiress. 

The problem I have 'lith his 
behavior in Florida is his baseless 
accusations that Florida Gov. Jeb 
Bush and Secretary of State Kather-
ine Harris were responsible for dis-
enfranchising African American 
and Jewish voters statewide. 

I can handle accusations that 
they favored Bush in the election 
but I don't believe it had any influ-
ence on the outcome of the elec-
tion. Jackson's claim, however, is 
simply unbelievable. It just shows 
that the man has no ethics. Claim-
ing that police were sent to prevent 
minorities from voting might .have 
been justified .in the 1960s, but 
without some hard evidence this is 
nothing more than slander, for 
which Jeb Bush and Harris could 
file substantial lawsuits against 
Jackson. Mostly, I wish they would 
let the issue rest, but part of me 
wants him sued. 

Don't misunderstand me. I 
advocate civil rights as much as the 
next guy. I cannot, however, con-
done Jackson's obviously unaccept-
able, underhanded methods. 

I can 't go into much more 
detail here without a Kenneth 
Starr-sized report to justify all my 
cla ims. What I can tell you , how-
ever, is that this man is bad news. 

In his youth, Jackson was friends 
with Martin Luther King, Jr. If you 
don't remember anything else from 
this article. remember this: King was 
a great man who dedicated his life 
to fighting for civil rights and suc-
ceeded, but Jackson leeches off the 
African American community to 
serve his personal goals. 

Jackson has been out of the 
spotlight for more than two months 
now. I can only hope he stays out.

~D & NATION 
Imager May Violate Privacy 

WASHINGTON The 
Supreme Court wrestled Tuesday 
with how to apply the Fourth 
Amendment's ban on unreason-
able searches to a technological 
development the Constitution's 
framers most likely did not have in 
mind: a thermal imaging device 
that the police can use from out-
side a home to detect patterns of 
heat being generated from inside. 

The specific question in the 
hourlong argument was whether 
use of a thennal imager by the 
police is a search that, no less than 
an actual entry into a house, 
requires a warrant The underlying 
question was how the Constitution 
should take account not only of 
changing technology but also of 

~iety's 'Changing understanding of 
technology's threat to privacy. 

- Under the court's precedents. 
the Fourth Amendment protects 
only those expectations of privacy 
that are "reasonable." Someone 
who conducts business in front of 
an open living room window, for 
example. may be deemed to have 
forfeited any reasonable expectation 
of privacy. In the case Tuesday, the 
lawyer for an Oregon man con-
victed of growing marijuana in his 
home argued that the police 
en$aged in an illegal search by. 
usmg a thermal imager to detect 
the distinctive heat pattern made 
by the high-intensity lights that 
are often used for marijuana culti-
vation. The police used the infor-
mation as the basis for obtaining a 
warrant to search the house. 

Britain: 
Blair defended tire stance 
of Britain and tire U. 5, 
posed to enforce no-flight zones in 
force since 1991 . But the bomb-
ings drove a wedge between Britain 
and its European allies and raised 
protests in the British Parliament 
that a decade of sanctions against 
Iraq had punished the Iraqi people 
rather than their avowed target, the 
government of Saddam Hussein . 

In an interview with U.S. corre-
spondents Tuesday night, Blair 

People have a reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy in what goes on 
behind the opaque walls of their 
homes, the lawyer, Kenneth Lerner, 
told the justices. What the thennal 
imager captures "really is molecular 
infonnation that migrates through 
our walls," he said, adding. "[f we 
are now saying that we can capture 
that kind of information without a 
warrant, we can reduce our whole 
world to that type of wave and mol-
ecule, and our walls mean nothing.~ 

But Michael R. Dreeben, a 
deputy solicitor general arguing for 
the government, said people did not 
have a reasonable expectation of 
privacy "in the heat that's on the 
exterior surface of their walls." 

Justice Stephen Breyer objected 
that the expectation of privacy "is 
not in heat loss, it's in what is 
going on in the house." Lerner 
came in for tough questioning. 

"Why don't your reasonable 
expectations of privacy include 

technology?~ Justice Antonin 
Scalia wanted to know. Inasmuch 
as there are thermal imagers in the 
world, why not expect people to 
guard against them just as "you 
pull your curtains if you want pri-
vacy because you know people 
have binoculars," Scalia said. 

"The burden: Lerner said, 
"really is improperly placed on the 
ciriz;en to anticipate what type of 
technology the government may 
come up with." 

- Linda Greenhouse 
The New York Tunes 

defended the hawkish stance of 
Britain and the United States, but 
indicated that he and Bush would 
discuss a revision of the sanctions 

tha~ were imposed after Iraq invad-
ed Kuwait in 1990. 

"What we are doing on Iraq is 
absolutely essential," Blair said, 
chroniclin$ the Iraqi leader's 
killing of hiS own Kurdish citizens, 
his war in the 1980s with Iran and 
his invasion of Kuwait as evidence 
that Saddam is "probably the most 
dangerous ruler at the present time 
anywhere in the world." 

"In the longer tenn we need to 
look at a better sanctions and 
inspection regime: Blair said, 

China to List Fares Again 
HONG KONG - Seventeen 

months after an unforgiving stock 
market spoiled its foreign debut, 
China's flagship offshore oil com-
pany is again preparing to list its 
shares in New York and Hong 
Kong. 

How it fares will say much 
about China's ability to privatize 
its corporate sector in a market 
that has turned even colder. 

The shares of China National 
Offshore Oil, the country's third-
largest oil producer, will begin 
trading in New York on Thesday, 
Feb. 27, and in Hong Kong on 
Wednesday, Feb. 28. The company 
was expected to price its stock 
Wednesday at slightly less than 
$16.60 an American depository 
share, putting it on track to raise 
about $1 .3 billion. 

That is $1 .2 billion less than 
China National Offshore aimed 
for in its first planned initial pub-
lic offering. which was scrapped 
in October 1999 after investors 
balked at the price. The collapse 
of that offering deeply embar-
rassed the company and its 
underwriter, Salomon Smith 
Barney. 

China National Offshore 
drop~d Salomon in favor of

Now, even as the bankers pro-
mote the deal, they are treading 
lightly.

referring to Western demands that 
Iraq submit itself once again to

He did not elaborate, but offi-
cials said Britain wanted to refine 
the sanctions in some way that 
would deflect broad European and 
Arab criticism that the trade 
restrictions have been catastrophic 
for ordinary Iraqis. 

Speaking at 10 Downing St., 
his official residence, Blair sought 
on Tuesday to deflect criticism of 
the current sanctions regime, 
blaming what he termed the suf-
fering of ordinary Iraqis on 
Saddam's refusal to spend autho-

more people ask what has 
changed with the company. As we 
tell them, their concerns have 
evaporated. " 

Rival investment banks agreed 
that China National Offshore had 
rebounded from the fiasco - a 
fact they said was testament to its 
tight focus, disciplined culture 
and more realistic expectations. 

"Usually, there is a very big 
stigma attached to a failed deal," 
said Paul Bernard, an oil industry 
analyst with Goldman, Sachs. 
"What's surprising is how posi-
tive investors are about this com-
pany." . 

China National Offshore 
looks tidy compared with China's 
No. 1 and No. 2 oil companies, 
PetroChina and Sinopec; both 
went public last year and have 
traded poorly in recent weeks. 

PetroChina has been dogged 
by its parent company's opera-
tions in Tibet and Sudan, which 
have drawn protests from human 
rights groups. Sinopec has has 
been hurt by the spike in crude 
oil prices. 

China National Offshore Oil 
is more likely to benefit from 
higher oil prices because it is an 
exploration and production com-
pany. And it does not have the 
entangling alliances of 
PetroChina. It was created from 
scratch by the government in 
1982.

"lbe truth is that while Saddam 
remains there, things will not get 
better for them," Blair said. "And 
what we cannot do is allow him to 
threaten the stability of his neigh-
bors and the rest of the world." 

Blair, who had a close friendship 
with fonner President Bill Clinton 
- which he said on Tuesday will 
endure "always" - is to meet Vice 
President Dick Cheney in 
Washington on Friday before meet-
ing with Bush at Camp David.

Bush: 
Bush plans tv spend 
money on "Reading First" 
ConIInued from ..... 1 
the next five years to promote 
reading for grade-school pupils. 
The school visit was reminiscent 
of many such· stops during Bush's 
presidential campaign. 

Unveiling a bit of the fine print 
of the budget he will send to 
Congress next week, Bush said he 
would propose spending $900 mil-
lion on his "Reading First" initia-
tive next year, a threefold increase 
over current spending on similar 
programs. Some of the money, he 
said, would go to retrain teachers 
in how best to teach the ABCs. 

Later, Bush changed the sub-
ject to tax cuts, standing on stage 
at a community center in 
Kirkwood, Mo., with four mem-
bers of the Yahng family who 
were selected to highlight the 
benefits of the president's pro-
posal to reduce taxes by $1 .6 tril-
lion over the next decade. 

Chuck Yahng makes $44,000 a 
year working in public relations 
at St. Louis University. The White 
House said Yahng and his wife, 
who have two children, would see 
their annual federal income taxes 
reduced from $2,000 to $150. 

Critics of Bush's tax-cut plan 
assert that the bulk of the savings 
would go to those far better off 
than the Yahngs, and that Bush has 
yet to share the stage with one of 
the millionaires who would benefit 
even more from his tax overhaul. 

The president largely steered 
clear of the most controversial 
aspect of his education package, a 
proposa l to allow parents to 
remove thei r children from fa il ing 
schools while retaining the public 
funds fo r their education. 

Bush took on critics of his plan 
to regularly test students as a way 
of gauging school performance. 

"There's a group of fo lks that 
will say you can't test because it's 
racist: Bush said in Columbus at 
Sullivant Elementary School, 
which has under-average but 
improving test scores.

Juvenile 

Bio: Juvenile was born Tenus Gray and for tht: past 15 
years he has he has been honing his styk:. He ca me onto 
the music scene about a year ago with a hi t song ca lled 
·'Ha." HIS las full-length album, "400 Degrecz," IS 
t:xpected to be quadruplr platinum. His most recent 
album, ''Tha G-Code" has also been met with positive 
reviews. 

The l':ew Orleans native started out working at a local 
gas plant to support his family and rapped on the side. He 
was able to successfully blend hip-hop and "bounce" 
music. The success of his tune, "Bounce For the Juvenile" 
led him to a deal with a small ell' York record label. The 
deal eventually soured and turned Juvenile away from the 
music industry. 

Juvenile eventually came back onto the music scene 
after he realized that he could emerge as a rapper that did 
not adhere to the West Coast or East Coast formula .

Rod Stewart 
"Human" 
Atlantic 

C 

Rod Stewart has always liuccessfully 
- adapted his music to fit current music 
_ trends for more than two decades. Once 

again, Stewart tries to update his vocal tal-
ents with his latest release, a pedestrian 
album "Human: which blends rock ballads 
with a mix of R&B, soul and Motown. 

With his name fading, Stewart has noth-
ing to lose by changing his music once 
again . He made the change from rock to 
pop, but this time his attempt is not as suc-
cessful. From the first track, it becomes clear 
that the album is rough. 

Rob Dickins, an R&B and pop produc-
er, worked with Stewart on . his latest 
attempt to change his style. Dickins is best 
remem bered for Cher's "Believe." It may 
have worked for eher, but Stewart is not as 
good at combining his rock ballads and 
new music. 

Unlike Stewart 's previous albums, 
"Human" does not achieve this blend suc-
cessfully and has a hard time matching his 
raspy voice to the R&B sound. It's not an 
awful album; it's decent, but there are no 
memorable songs. 

The last track, UI Can't Deny It: has a 
pleasant and mellow tone that makes it the 

most commercial and upbeat song on the 
album, but it cannot compare to UMaggie 
May" or any of his earlier works. 

On the other hand, Stewart's music is 
smooth, warm and polished, showing that 
his style has aged gracefully. As a result, the 
slower ballads are much better than the 
other R&B-tinged songs. Stewart has shown 
that he is a versatile singer who is able to 
keep up with the current trends, but he is 
starting to show his age.

Idlewild are the best band you have never

These lads from Edin burgh made th e 
mistake of putting together a punk rock 
group at the height of Britpop in 1995. 
While groups such as Oasis and Suede 
were making a splash in the British and 
American music scenes, Idlewild were left

Refreshing punk rock

ContI ..... froIII PICe • 
guitars and their Pavement-like 
wit have finally made heads 
tum. Although they say they 
are influenced most by Ameri-
can indie-rock bands, they are 
able to retain a distinctively 
British sound within their 
songs. This is due in part to the 
production efforts of Dave 
Eringa, who has also produced 
the music of the Manic Street 
Preachers. 

Lead singer Roddy 
Woomble reaches for beauti-
ful harmonies that edge into 
an angst-filled scream power-
ful enough to shake a bottle 
of Evian off your desk. 
Woomble's favorite singer is 
Morrissey. The two singers' 
emotional depth is compara-
ble, but Woomble makes sure 
you know that he is the front 
man of a punk band. Howev-
er, beautiful ballads such as 
"The Bronze Medal" make 
you wonder if they are edging 
toward a R.E.M.-esque 
sound. 

Their first single was 
released in March 1997 on the 
same label responsible for early 

Thursday, February 22, 2001 

Eugenius and Chicane singles. 
Successful airplay on Steve 
Lamacq's BBC Radio 1 
Evening Session gave them 
more exposure, which led to 
working with the Fierce Panda 
label, which has released sin-
gles from Mansun, Placebo 
and Embrace. 

Idlewild's most recent 
effort, "100' Broken Win-
dows," is a powerful album 
that experiments with emo-
tive drum beats and smooth 
harmonies. This isn't just 
three-chord punk rock, but 
an intelligent, hard-hitting 
style of punk that is new and 
intense. 

"Little Discourage" is their 
first single and was an instant 
hit in the United Kingdom. 
Other tracks such as "Actual-

. Iy It's Darkness' and "Idea 
Track" round out the solid 
album. 

If you believe Blink 182 is 
punk rock, then you need to 
let Idlewild take you on a 
sonic ride into honest punk 
rock, recalling the quality 
sound of punk rock in the late 
'70s and '80s. 

"tOO Broken Windows" will 
be released March 13. Idlewild

ting Factory in Los Angeles on

Blues: Over the past four years, JOlmy Lang has played with Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones and blues legend B.B. Kirlg. 
Now, at 20, he has continued to mature ana devefop his style. 

Jonny Is All Grown Up Now 
Lang has not deviated from his original blues influences 
and continues to amaze audiences 
By TARA JONES 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

As I walked into the intimate 
Dreamcatcher Lounge at Viejas 
Casino, I decided to take a' seat 
and subtly listen to comments 
made about the blues performer of 
the evening. Praise for him 
reached me in the form of a one-
shot-too-many older man who 
bluntly said, "This guy fuckin ' 
rocks! You excited?" 

Urn, yeah, but I did not need a 
random man to inform me of Jonny 
Lang's talent; I had heard and 
believed all the hype from day one. 

Four years ago, "ch ild prodigy" 
was the best description of Lang. 
He kept his listeners in awe with 
his amazing blues singing and gui-
tar playing. Lang was a huge 50-
year-old black man from Missis-
sippi hiding inside the body of a 
lanky 16-year-old white boy from 
Minnesota. 

The music industry took 
notice. Since his debut album "Lie 
To Me," Lang has been invited to 
tour with B.B. King, Aerosmith, 

The Rolling Stones and Blues 
Traveler. He has also headlined a 
world tour. 

Four years after his debut, Lang 
has left the heading of "child prodi-
gy" and taken his place among the 
blues elite. He has also released his 
second album, "Wander This 
World." Straying from purely blues 

Four years after 
his debut, Lang 
has left the heading 
of I child prodigy' 
taken his place 
among the blues elite. 
to include a touch of R&B and 
rock, this album received more 
acclaim than the first. 

Yet, in trying to distance himself 
from other flashy musicians who 
tend to focus on high drama, Lang 
stayed true to his musical influ-
ences like blues men King and the 
late Luther Allison. He describes 
his music style as the "simple kind

of full and dirty sound." 
One might assume Lang's fan 

base would be limited to twen-
tysomethings, but he has fans of all 
ages. At Viejas Friday night, the aver-
age fan was a middle-aged male. 

With no opening act or grand 
entrance, Lang and the rest of his 
band nonchalantly walked onto the 
stage. As the fans screamed and 
clapped, Lang smiled and waved 
casually to the crowd and began to 
effortlessly strum his guitar. 

The performance lasted about 
an hour-and-a- half, and Lang had 
the crowd in the palm of his hand 
the entire time. The audience fol-
lowed Lang's emotions through-
out; it listened intently to Lang's 
self-written ballad "Walking Away." 
People danced in the ais les to 
Lang's upbeat "Lie To Me." Lang 
also introduced fans to a couple of 
new songs from his latest album. 

The show was incredible. Fans, 
including me, walked in wi th the 
intention of seeing a great show 
and left knowing we had witnessed 
one of the most incredible musi-
cians of our time.

'Sweet November' 
Evokes Sour Taste 
Charlize Theron unable to save film 
from Reeves, formulaic plot 
IyUUANDA. 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

It is difficult to describe "Sweet 
November" without comparing it 
to a "Love Story" redone for the 
millennium. That's exactly what it 
is, and I don't mean that as a com-
pliment. It is a remake of a 1968 
film called "Sweet November." 

Only now, everything is awfully 
cute and politically correct. 

Cue entrance of token gay 
neighbor/drag queen with amaz-
ing job - because lr-IY people can 
have important positions, you 
know. Of course, we would all 
love to be vegan animal lovers liv-
ing out our dreams in the most 
expensive city in the world, mys-
teriously affording a lush apart-
ment without actually working. 
Of course we should all live as if 
money doesn't matter. Soft-focus 
lenses and colored light would be 
a plus, too. 

I fundamentally disagree with 

Winterfest: 
New vocalist to perform 
with Lucy Pearl 

·We didn't have a New Orleans 
rapper that straight up used our lan-
guage and rapped for our people; 
Juvenile stated in a Cash Money 
Records interview. "Everybody want-
ed to be either East Coast or West 
Coast. That's where I came in." 

Juvenile eventually caught the 
attention of Cash Money Records 
and in 1997 released "Solja Rags; 
which was an undergroun~ hit. 
Eventually, "Solja Rags· reached a 
half-million sales and with that 
recognition, Cash Money Records 
was able to reach a distribution 
deal with Universal Records. 

Juvenile's second album with 
Cash Money and Universal earned 
the Billboard award for "R& 8 
Album of the Year· in 1999 and the 
single, "Ha" won "Single of the 
Year" from The Source Awards. 

Juvenile is expected to release 
his new album, "Project English,· 
March 27. 

What to Expect: The fact that 
Juvenile doesn't conform too much 
to the West coast and East coast 
formula is refreshing. He may not 
have the hit of the year in 2001 but 
he definitely knows how to enter-
tain. 

Lug Pearl 
810: Take jazz-funk singer Joi, 

Raphael Saadiq from Tony! Toni! 
Tone!, mix them with Ali Shaheed 
Muhammed from A Tribe Called 
Quest, and you get the talented 
group known as Lucy Pearl. 

Originally formed in the sum-
m~r of 1999 with Saadiq, 
Muhammed and former En Vogue 
vocalist Dawn Robinson, Lucy 
Pearl immediately worked on their 
May 2000 self-titled album. bucy 
Pearl seemed to be a new super- . 
group on its way to the top until 
Robinson left the group early in 
November. 

Robinson went on to sign a solo 
recording contract with Q Records. 

Lucy Pearl did not falter, and 
recruited the talents of Joi, who has 
released three solo albums of her 
own. Her last album was released 
in 1996 and since then she has 
worked with Fishbone, Organized 
Noise, Dallas Austin and the 
Goodie Mob. 

Saadiq was the bassist, singer 

the treatment of the majority of the 
underlying issues in this film. 
Additionally, it is boring. 

I don't like chick flicks, and 
"Sweet November" reminds me 
why. Boy-meets-girl-and-almost-
loses-girl ad infinitum. But I won't 
give away the ending in case you 
like Keanu Reeves and want to see 
it, just for the pleasure of seeing 
him as the rat-race-Ioving ad man,. 
Nelson. 

Reeves can't act. Sorry, but he 
just can't. Charlize Theron saves 
the day as the woman whose task 
in life is to "save" men. I 'm sure a 
lot of women will identify with this 
aspect of the film. 

The film should come with a 
warning label that says, "This is a 
film, not a representation of real 
life." Cue hundreds of females 
rushing out to save the first and 
best traumatized male in their 
immediate environment. Gals, 
don't go there. It doesn't work that 
way in real life. 

and songwriter of the popular 
group Tony! Toni! Tone!. After 
Saadiq left the group in 1998 he 
went on to work with John Mellen-
camp, the Bee Gees and D'Angelo. 

Muhammed picked up the sax 
at age 13 but turned his musical 
energy to the turntables. During 
high school he met up with rapper 
and writer Q-Tip and with another 
rapper, Phi fe, A Tribe Called Quest 
was born. Muhammed was able to 
seamlessly fuse R&B and jazz with 
hip-hop. Muhammed was also part 
of the team that helped put togeth-
er D'Angelo's 1995 album, "Brown 
Sugar.· 

Joi is officially on tour with 
Lucy Pearl and she will also be fea-
tu!'Cd on next Lucy Pearl album. 

What to Expect: In spite of for-
mer En Vogue vOQllist Robinson 
leaving the group last November, 
you can expect Lucy ~ar\ to put on 
an amazing show. Lucy Pearl offers 
a smooth comoination of hip-hop 
and R&S along with seductive 
vocals and funky grooves. The 
songwriting. singing and musical 
talent of Saadiq, Muhammed and 
Joi cannot be ignored. 

Sprung Monkey 
8io: San Diego punk band 

Sprung Monkey debuted in 1995 
with their album "Swirl.· They 
eventually signed to Hollywood 
Records and released another 
album in 1998 called "Mr. Funny 
Face: 

Their hit song was "Get 'Em 
Outta Here; a summer anthem in 
1998 with its tales of San Diego 
girls and the trouble they get in to. 

After their hit in 1998 they did 
not release another album but they 
toured extensively in the United 
States, Australia and New Zealand. 
Sprung Monkey also made a trip to 
Japan with Kottonmouth Kings and 
traveled extensivtly in Europe with 
The Offspring. Monkey have also 
made numerous television appear-
ances and contributed to sound-
tracks and r.adio shows. 

Sprung Monkey did find their 
way into the studio to work on a 
new album. Their new album, pro-
duced by Jim Win, should be 
released in late October and is ten-
tatively titled "Get a Taste." 

What to Expect: Sprung Mon-
key adds the guitar-rock element to 
Winterfest 2001, making it a well-
balanced show. Their extensive 
touring schedule has led to a pol-
ished live act that should energize 
the crowd.

the Banana Slugs 

halfway mark when Tiger Dexter 
Macaranas served three straight 
points to give Pacific an insur-
mountable 22-18 advantage. 

In the second set Chen 
slammed the door on the Tigers 
with two straight kills to give 
UCSD a 23-17 lead . They then 
picked up the last two points to 
take the match. 

The third set was pretty much 
all UOP. 

The fourth was devastating to 
the Tritons, as they lost a 26-21 
lead and ended up losing the set 
and the match. 

The blown lead was dis-
turbingly reminiscent of ll.;:;1 
game against Stanford and was 
possibly the product of inexperi-
ence. 

"We're not in that position 
very often: Larsen explained . 
"We don't have anyone stepping 
up and demanding the ball. In 
game four, we were playing better 
than Pacific but we made a num-
ber of poor decisions and poor 
plays." 

However, in the end, it was a 
satisfactory weekend for men's vol-
leyball.

ing experience,:' Larsen said. "It's

Lobster: 
A pregame warmup is 
necessitated to play 

rency and acting fearful of come-
uppance from ~e vengeful hea-
then that has darkened his 
hearth . 

Once again safely ensconced in 
the relative safety of the front 
yard, it is time to resume the 
imbibing in preparation for the 
evening's contest. Slackers or 
those with neither will nor resolve 
may be able to sneak through 
with a scant six or seven hours of 
preparation, but one should be 
diligent and fastidious in his pur-
suits, leaving no stone untumed 

- in ensuring that he will be able to 
compete at the utmost of his abil-
ity. 

Recreational softball, you see, 
is an activity where those who do 
not adequately bolster themselves 
will end up at the bottom of the 
heap. Sober guys finish last, as the 
saying goes, and among our 
troops, we pride ourselves in the 
consistent 11 -hour pre-game 
"warm-up." Our team, the Pacific 
Beach Drive Drafters, takes all 
things softball related seriously. 
Whether it be running out weak 
pop-flies or finishing the 
"homies" portion of the [des, all 
perfunctory actions must be p~r­
formed with extreme hustle. 

The Drafters are a group of 
finely tuned athletes, composed 
mainly of Cage inhabitants and 
rounded out by assorted other 
recalcitrants. What binds the team 
together is our shared, ali-encom-
passing willingness to go to any 
lengths of athletic endeavor or to 
any level of complete dehabilitat-
ing inebriation in order to get the 
job done. 

Those looking to get involved in 
this great game, and with spring 
approaching a good number of 
people are, should take heed of a 
few simple rules, guidelines, strate-
gies, if you will, for assistance. They 
will allow for maximum enjoyment 
when out on the diamond. 

First off, when composing your 
squad, make sure that all of your 
prayers are committed to the cause. 
Flaky types make bad teammates, 
so you want someone who will 
always head out to the all impor-
tant playoff game, regardless of the 
fact that the new episode of "Felic-
ity" is on. To ensure this, it is 
important to make your players 
sign, in blood, a contract that gives 
you the power to beat them sense-
less with a bat if they ever miss a 
game, or are late. or drop a fly ball 
with the bases loaded. 

[t is also crucial to keep score 
during the game, as it is helpful in 
composing statistics, making key 
lineup changes and handing out 
the aforementioned beatings. 

Practice is also of great impor-
tance to any fledgling team. No 
matter the lengths you go to 
assemble your dream team, there 
will always inevitably be a few 
slouges on your roster who will 
have to be whipped into shape. 
Taking them out to a field or dirt 
lot and smashing ground balls at 
them will help their fielding, and 
pelting them with fastballs will 
build their baning prowess. 

Once the team is put together, 
the scorebooks are bought and the 
players are well-trained, it is 
important to begin the final, most 
integral portion of the pregame 
softball experience. As mentioned 
above, hours and hours of drink-
ing are crucial to a team's success. 
An oversight of any magnitude on 
this count will lead to disastrous 
results, a lifetime of misery and a 
broken spirit for you and your on 
field mates. 

So prepare thyself well, and 
take to the field with this new-
found wisdom to lead you to your 
glorious destiny. Oh yeah, and 
also remember to freeze on a line 
drive and never make the first or

Pacific area. The race belonged 
to rival USD, as its A team won 
with a time of 1 :47.48. UCSD's 
A, Band C teams all placed with-
in the top 10. 

The women's 400 individual 
medley pinned the best three 
athletes in the competition 
against one another. [n the end, 
USD's Carolyn Gorrick and Tori 
Bushnell, winners of previous 
heats, took first and second 
respectively. [n an impressive 
swim, UCSD sophomore 
Watanabe placed third. [n the 
women's 100 breaststroke, San-
dra Lopez of UCSD won con-
vincingly, nearly two seconds 
ahead of No.2 Monica Oleksyn 
of Pepperdine. Rachel Arthur 
finished third in the final. The 
women's 200 medley was 
another victory for USD with a 
finish of 7:37.10. The A team 
from UCSD placed second with 
a time of 7:45.54. 

On the men's side, the Uni-
versity of Hawaii completely 
dominated the field. In the 
men's 100 butterfly, Jacob 
Fraire of CSU Bakersfield took 

The UCSD Guardian 

home top honors, with UH's 
John Pierce right behind him. 
Pat Carter of UCSD finished 
ninth. 

The team from Hawaii dom-
inated the men's 100 breast-
stroke as it claimed the top four 
spots in the final. UCSD's Luke 
Seed managed to get eighth but 
looked from the outside as the 
race belonged to the Rainbows. 
In the men 's 100 backstroke 
final, UH's Stephen Freas 
claimed victory. UCSD's 
Stephanie Wong finished sixth. 
[n the brutal 800 freestyle relay, 
CSU Bakersfield beat out Unr-
versity of Hawaii by only two 
seconds in a remarkable finish. 
The lritons mustered a strong 
seventh in the competition with 
a time of 7:03.24. 

On the last day of the compe-
tition, the women's team from 
USD swam its way into the vic-
tory lane. In the women's 1650 
freestyle final, USD occupied 
the first three stops in the win-
ner's column. The lritons' own 
Nina Tomasevich made a run for 
the top of the list but finished 
fourth. 

UCSD claimed victory as 
Watanabe won the 200 back-
stroke final, beating out Melissa 
Willard of USD by less than two 
seconds. The Tritons were again 
victorious when Lopez won the

the competition with a time of

claimed first place in four of the 
six races, dominated the last race, 
the 400 freestyle relay, by nearly 
five seconds over second place 
CSU Bakersfield. 

"[t was a good meet,n Watan-
abe said. "We now have a full

our chances of doing well. USD

them is not bad: 

All in all, the women's team 
from USD and the men's team

the athletes that represented 
UCSD performed extremely 
well and look to regain their 
winning form for the remainder 
of the season and into nation-

Short Again this Weekend 
Losses to Stanford, Pacific drop the Tritons' record to 1-10 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
ASSOCiate Sport Editor 

Last weekend, fourth-
ranked powerhouse Stanford 
and 10th-ranked University of 
the Pacific loomed in UCSD's 
future. Those games have now 
passed and the Tritons are look-
ing back on two matches they 
could have won. 

UCSD gave the Stanford 
Cardi nal a scare at RIMAC 
Arena Saturday before eventu-
ally dropping the match in four 
sets 27-30, 30-24, 35-33 and 
33-31. 

The Tritons squared off 
against the UOP Tigers Sunday 
and had little success, losing 
30-22, 25-30, 30-19 and 30-26. 

The losses put the Tritons at 
1-10 fo r the season and 0-9 in 
league play. 

UCSD was not intimidated 
by Stanford , and qUickly 
jumped on the Cardinal. The 
Tritons won the first set 30-27 
and held Stanford to a paltry 
.026 attacki ng average. 

" Ve came out real strong in 
the tirst game: said head coach 
Ron Larsen. "They came in per-
haps a little verconfident and 
"" : umped on them early." 

Stanfo rd won the next 'arne

Women's Water Polo 
gets rolled by Hawaii 
11-5 and 14-5 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCS D women's water polo 
team did not have a very nice trip to 
Hawaii last week, as they lost a pair 
of games to the University of 
Hawaii Rainbows. 

"We didn't execute very well ," 
said Triton head coach Larry 
Sanders. "We didn't play to our 
potential." 

The first game went to the 
Rainbows, 11 -5. 

The Tritons had a chance early 
on with the game knotted at three. 
Then Hawaii took off with four 
unanswered goal~ 

The second game was all 
Hawaii as they won 14-5 . UCSD 
never got into it. 

"( don't think we shot the ball 
particularly well," Sanders said. "We 
had the opportunity to score but 
didn't put the ball into the cage.· 

UCSD was really hurting with 
sophomore star Samara Silverman 
out with poison oak. 

"We hope to have her back this 
weekend," Sanders said. 

The two 10sses drop the Thtons' 
record to 2-4 on the sease!); Next up 
for UCSD is a trip to Santa Barbara 
this weekend. Friday, the Thtons
