Winter's cold to get colder 
By BRUCE GARDNER 

Pacific ews Service 

When arctic cold swept 
acros' the ea tern US in 
january. 1981 . many Am ri-
cans thought they had seen the 
worst that weather could 
offer. Frigid new record,> wer 
set in areas as widespread as 
Atlantic City. NJ . (4 degrees 
F). Baltimore (8 degrees). 
Richmond. Va . (6 degrees) and 
Maine (-24 degrees). 

Then 1982 arrived. eclipsing 
all t hat. On jan 11. lows of 2 
degrees were registered in 

ew j ersey. 4 degrees I low 
zero In Maryland. minus II 
degrees in Virginia. and in 
Chicago. an all -tim low of 26 
degree: below zero. It was the 
"cold st day of the century." 
the ationa l Met rological 
Center declared . 

Inde d. the last 10 years 
have hrought a st'ri s of record 
wint er~. not just in ort h 
America. hut in Europe and 

oth r regions as well. The 197~3 
World Meteorological Organi-
zation bulletin listed scores of 
record weather extremes 
during 1972 . George and 
Helena Kukla of. Columbia 

niversity 's Lamont -Dou -
gherty Geological Observatory 
measured. \' ia sa tellite 
photography. a 4-million-
sq uare-kilom ter increase in 
1971 mean annual snow cover 
over 1970 for the Northern 
Hemi ph ere. 

They noted that only seven 
consecutive winter'i of similar 

~everit y could establish an Ice 
cover matching in area. if not 
depth . the glacial co\'er of the 
last ice age. Ware about 
10 . 000 years into an 
"interglacial." a per 'oel

Contrary to widespread 
predictions of a disastrous 
warming trend - a "green-
hous' effect" caused bv 
increased -a rbon dioxide 

(C02) in the atmo~phere. 
threatening to melt the polar 
ice caps. t he next ice age in fact 
may be underway. 

According to Kukla . recent 
research shows t har in t he last

Medics for money 
Regardless of their \' ital 

ill1lXlrtance. no one e\'er weeps 
for doctors . With half of those 
in the US earning 4.000 per 
year, it's easy to under~;tand. 

As for would-be doctors. 
many college graduate~ have 
probably felt jealously 
indIgnant toward their white-
robed coun terparts goi ng for 
t he big bucks. 

Thus. man~ Americans 
probably fumed at a recent 
Senate (;o\'ernmental Affair~ 
Committee report : Large 
number. of health professio-
nab - phYSIcians as nwell a~ 
nurses and technicians -
aren't repaying the federal 

~tudent loans than helped 
make their careers possIble. In 
one federal dIrect-loan 
program cited by t h 
commill e. almost one-third of 
I he debt~ ($:34 million worth) 
were delinquent: 84.4 million 
of thaI tot al was 0\\ t'cI bv

that one "delinqu ent"

SI9.00\l car loan. Yet he'd 
fallen two years behind in 
paying of the rem a 10 ing $1,552 
on his obligatIOn to the 
government. While his case 
may have been extreme. hi~ 
stellar credit record in the 
prl\ate ~ector was rather 
typical.

In mostly government

made available LO medical 

student~ during 1980·81, it's 
not strikIng that so many can

Trouble with nuke plants

before theIr tllne. and no on(' is 
vet ... ure how to di spose of 
i hem or how much disposal 
w III cost.

and chemicals in the coolant 
water are taking their toll on 
the thou~and~ of tool~ in the 
plant,,' steam generators.

\e~~eb which house thefuel to 
becume more brltllp and 
\ ulnerable to rupture under 
c\,' rLaln conditions - a 
problem for which no 
permanent cure has been 
found. These and other 
wmptoms of t he aging process 
a-re not only cau~ing 
temporary "hutdown~ and 

increa ~ed COSh. they are 
hastening the day when the 
planl'i will ha\e to "hut down 
permanently . 

At lea ... t two nucll'ar planl ~ 
(Humboldt Ba\' in California 
and Three Mile Island (TMI) 111 
Penns\-lvania ) are almost 
definitClY "down" for good. 
Two ot her ... (illinOIS' Dresden 
and New york· ... Indian Point) 
al~o are likely candidtes for 
retirement in the near future. 

Old nuclear plant s cannot 
simpl} be abandoned. They 
are full of very dangerou~ 
radioanivit v and wil l remain 
hazardou" f(lr man v centuries. 
Large areas in each plant are 
contaminated from lengthy 
exposure 10 highly radioacti\e 
materials . Steel ancl concret e 
walls contain embedded 
particl ~ of highly radioactive 
eleme nt s like nick le-!'i9. which 
has a half·life of 0,000 years. 

De s pite the growing 
urgency of the demn im i~si()n · 
i ng problem. nelt her the 
industry nor the Federal 
Nuclear Regulatory Commis· 
... Ion (NRC) has yet come up 
\\' Ith a fIrm soiution . Both 
j.,Tf'OU p~ were con fiden t that 
mo"t plants would last their 
expect 'd designt,>d lifet i me of 
:10 to ,10 years. Since most 

plant~ dldn't ~tar t up until the 
lat e 1960 ... or early '7fb. the 

problems of decommisslOOIng 
a ppeared to he far in the 
future . 

But the probil!m ha ... crept 
up on the111 . in part because of 
premature shutdowns like Ihe 
one at t hl' 1'1\11 plant. and in 
part becau~e sC\'eral plant~ 
appear to be wcari ng oul 
before t he\' were expect ed to. 

In ~eeking a solution to this 
prob lem. researchers and 
engineers have linle solid 
information togoon . Although 
government and industry 
officials repeatedly assert that 
the technology for decommIs-
s ioning plant~ exist s today. 
t he actual hands-on experi-
ence is conspicuously lacking. 
To date, only one US reactor 

ha~ been thoroughly dIsman -
tled : the Elk River reactor in 
:Ylinncsota. a government 

re~earch reactor which was a 
tiny fraction of the sizc of 
lOday\ large commercial 
planb. 

The problem of decommi~­
s ioning commercial plants 

\\'a~ most recently dealt with 
in a draft En vironmental 
Impact Statement issued in 
january 1981. In that report 
t he NRC oul lined three 
different options for decom 
missioning nuclear reactors. 

-Safe storage, common ly 
referred to as "mothballing." 
l nder this method, fuel would 
be unloaded from the plant. all 
liquid remov d and the system 

fllI~hed out. Then the plant 
would be locked up and 
guarded night and day for 
bet ween :~O and 1 O() vear~. 
After this time , when' some 
(but not a II) of the rad lOacl i \1 -
ty had worn off. the reactor~ 
would be dismantled and 
disposed of at some nuclear 
wa"te burial site. 

Though t he initial costs of 
this method wou ld be 
relatively low. the expense of 
maintaining security and 
safety far into th future 
wou Id entail a cum ulat ive co"t 
almo'>t impossible to predict. 

-Entombment. or concrete 
burial. Thi ~ process would 
involve t he sa me initi a l 
cleanup as ~afe s torage , after 
which the gutted reactor 
would be covered with 
ma.,sive amounts of concrete. 

The problem with this 
mel hod i~ that the concret e 
"hi ·Id would notla-;I as long a~ 
the dangerou~ radioacllvity 
embL>dded in tht· walls of th : 
rea 'tor. 

-Deco n t a 1111 na t ion i1nd 
dl sma nt le11len t. Th is prcx'ess 
would II1volve a much greater 
effort immedialely after Ihe 
" hllldrlllll of th!.' plant The 

plant would IX' dismantled 
piece by piece and t ranspOrl ed 
to a nuclear waste dump and 
buried. 

There are se\'eral problelll~ 
wit h t hi., plan. l nless t 11('

I he workers' ilwoh ed might 
rect'i\'e exces~i\' e d()~es of 
rildiation . These (, Iaborat e 
measures. of course. would be 
extremely expensi\·e. Also 
complicating this scena rio is 
the fact t hat as yet t here is not 
a permanent li censed facility 
for the disl)()sal of wast e which 
cou ld accept the dismembered 
port ions of I he plant. 

Currentlv, the NfK stair 
appears to- "upport the more 
thorough decontamination 
and dismantlement process. 
" The more we see of it. the 
more \\'e think the thing todo 
IS to encourage dismantle· 
ment." says Donald Calkins.

In the meantime. conc rn is 
growing about a related issue: 
Ilow much is all of thi . going to 
cost, and how is it going to IX' 
paid for' 

The cost of decommission -
ing an~' given reactor sti ll is a 
mall er of guesswork . There 
are too mam " X" factors. such 
as which mClh(xl i~ used. how 
long the work will take, how 
much inflation will add to the 
tOlal. etc. Indu stry and 
government spokesmen often 
quote an estimate of $40 
million per plant. A recent 
article in Science magazine 
puis the cost of del'Omllli ss ion-
i ng a 1200-megawatt reactor at 
$!'i0 million to $100 million. 

Where will the monev come 
from? The NRC does not 
curren I Iy require utilities to 

~et aside money for decommi s-
s ioning. so most of the haven't 
ea rmarked fund~ for it . To 
prod them in that direction. 
..,ollle stales a rc now

it a requirement. 

The RC itself is weighing

would require utilities to set

One player says no 
to violence in sports 

WASHINGTON - Paul 
Mulvey didn't fly here this 
week with the best of his 
profession for a White House 
luncheon and all-star hockey 
game. But he deserved an 
invitation. 

Until recently, Mulvey, 23, 
was a journeyman forward for 
the Los Angeles Kings of the 
National Hockey League, with 
a rather dubious reputation as 
an "enforcer." That is, he 
often compen ated for ales -
than-stellar scoring ability 
with his fists and brawn in a 
game not noted for it 
gentility. 

But lastjan. 24, the 6·4.220-
pound Canadian did the 
unexpected. When his coach 
"repeated ly" ordered him off 
the bench to lend his pugilistic 
s kills to a mid-game fight. 
Mulvey balked. He eventually 
joined the fracas, but only 
after both teams had cleared 
the benche . 

As far as his coach. Don 
Perry , was concerned, Mulvey 
had committed an unthinkable 
act of disobedience_ The young 
player was s ubsequentl y 
offered to any other NHL club 
that would take him. When 

none did, he was banished to a 
New Haven farm team. 

Stung by the initial flurry of 
publicity - all bad - the NHL 
uspended Perry for 15 day 

and slapped the King with a 
$5,000 fine. Lawyer John A. 
Ziegler Jr.. the League 
president, declared, "We 
cannot and will not ... tolerate 
premeditated attempt to 
ignore or act a~ainst the policy 
of the league. ' 

Had Mulvey again agreed to 
play the role of hit man . of 
course. hi action would 
undoubtedly have drawn little 
attention from sportswriters 
or the league. It' s what we 
expect from the game. 

Yet. the co nsc ientiou s 
objection of this unlikely hero 
has precipitated another 
round of debate over the excess 
violence in American ·ports. 
Even now, it' s unclear as to 
who holds ultimate responsibi-
lity. 

America 's major profes-
sional leagues - baseball. 
basketball, football and 
hockey - have all gone 
through the motion of 
addressing undue or premedi-

Turning off plants 
,'ClIlIillllCcI from pagc ~ 

Currently. most people who 
get part of their electricit y 
f rom nuclear plants are paying 
only for the plants' operating 
and construction costs in their 
elect ric bill. They are not 
paying for the costs that Ii 
ahead. Unless there is some 
uncharacteristically fast 
act ion by the NR or t h 
utilities. the decommissioning 
costs of some of the plants 
which are nearing retirement 
will fall un new rate payers 
w ho will never get any benefit 
out of the plants. 

Even more worrisome, high 
decom mission ing costs could 
push some of the sma ller 
utilities to the brink of 
bankruptcy , forcing U 
taxpayers to pay for fini shing 

t he Job. A harbinger of thi~ 
gloomy prospect is the sad 
history of TMI, wh re the 
p lant 's cleanup costs, 
currently put at $1 billion. 
almost certainl\' will have to 
be underwritten partially by 
US taxpayers. 

In some isolaled instances. 
people are trying to plan ahead 
to make sure this doesn't 
happen. California's Public 
l tilities Commission has been 
investigating \',:ays to assure 
funds for dcommissioning. 
And in Michigan. the Public 
' ervice Commission has been 
wrestling with the problem of 
how to fund the Big Rock 
nuclear plant's burial. But in 
the vast majority of states. 
Ihis issue simply is being 
deferred .

Computers in classrooms 
Editor: 

In response to the arttcle 
"Computers in theciassroom" 
(L'C D GC'ARDlA.Y. Feb. I. 
19 2), [ feel that computers 
have both good and bad points 
as teacher's aids. There :eem 
to be many good programs 
which can inspire creativity 
among children. Their 
thoughts may be stimulated to 
explor new worlds. But if the

California has an 'official' state everything 
From official animal to official fossil, California 's got it all 

By HENRY SCHULMAN 
Sucnllll cnto Corn!'l'- pund ... ·nt 

SAC RAMENTO - All 
right , c lass, what is our official 
state anima l? 

Any Ca lifornia schoolchi ld 
can te ll you the answer - the 
Ca lifornia grizzly bear. This 
most fea red beast stands 
poised. prowling the state flag. 
Known scientificall y as l!rsi/s 
cali/url/iwoS, the grizzly is also 
the officia l Un i\'ers itv of 
Calif orn ia ma:col. -

Also common kJl(J\\ ledgt' an' 
the s tat flower (goldrn 
poppy). tree (California 
redwood ) and colors (blue and 
gold). But the 'e are only th 
most famous siblings in the 
large California fami ly. 

Ahno:-it every type of flora 
and fauna imaginable has an 
officia l repre"entative listed in 
the state's archives . 

For exampl , the official 
state fish of California is the 

out h Fork golden troul. Thi~ 
lucky s wimmer was so 
design ated by the California 
State Legislature in 1947, 
which called the trout "the 
official sta t e fish and 
piscifaunal emblem of this 
'>tate ... 

Consider also t he serpen-
tine our official state rock . It is 
gree n and blue with a shiny 
outcropping surface. accord -
ing to the state guide. 

How about the California 
Dog-face butterf ly, Califor 
nia's official insect designated 
in 1974. It has iridescent 
bluish -bl ack w ings wi th an 
orang and sul phu r yellow 

color. The butterflv i~ a nat i\e 
of Ca lifornia. -

As a matter of fact , mo"t 
members of the state "family" 
are native . That's why the 
legislature even bothered to 
honor t hem in the first place . 

Di ff rent mem bers of the 
fam ily were usuall y brought to 
lhe attention of individual 
legis lators from constituents 
or groups who wanted their 
favorite bea'it enshrined. The 
but terfly. for example. was 
honored b\' a resol u t IOn 
"ponsored t)y Senator Ken 

~1addv .. choolchildren from 
his Fresno dIstrict a~ked him 
to introduce it. 

The California Valley Quail, 
our official state bird . was 
suggested by a powerful 
coa litIOn of bird-watching 
organizat ions. The legislat ure 
"uccumbed to o\'erwhelming 

pre~sure in 1931 by making 
the quail official. 

Ronald Reagan will 
probab ly be remembered as 
t he President who restruct ur-
ed our system of government. 
But to Ca lifornia trivia buffs. 
he will be remember d as the 
governor who s igned illtu law 
legis lation making the dese rt 
tortoise ((;()p/lCrII.I' agassizii) 
our official rept ile. 

Other state friends include 
the motto (" Eureka ''), mtneral 
(go ld ) and nickname (The 
Golden tate). 

There are also. however. 
some quite bizarre designa-
tions. For example. California 
has a state fossi l - the sabre-
toot hed tiger . There was

History museum has 
lecture on Leakey 

The San Diego Natural 
History Museum will sponsor 
a lecture From Fossils to 

Foolpri~lls: Further Evidence of 
Man's Evo/ulion in Easl 
Africa. to be given by Dr. Mary 
D. Leakey on Saturday. Mar. 6 
at 7:30 p.m. in the Casa Del 
Prado auditorium. located in 
Balboa Park. 

Dr. Leakey will describe her 
ear ly find s at Olduvai Gorge 
and Laetoli in northern 
Tanzania , as well as the more 
recent di coveries of fossil 
hominid footprints and 
remains that abound in these 
East Africa sedimen ts. The 
fossil footprint s. di. covered in 
1978, are 3.6 to 3.8 million 
year old, and believed to be 

the oldest known marks 01 
humanlike beings on Earth_ 

IThe series of di scoveries 
made by Mary and her lat e 
husband, Loui . S.B. Leakey 
(1903- 1972), helped rewrite the 
history of man - shifting the 
human cradle from Asia to 
Africa. and pushing man's 
origins back one million years. 
Their often controversial finds 
al o showed that there was not 
one solitary line from ape to 
man but instead two. three or 
perhaps more kinds of "pre· 
men" in evolutionary history, 

The Leakeys ' research has 
been centered around Olduvai 
Gorge. a 35 mile. long scar on 
Tanzania 's Serengeti Plain ,

Weather patterns in 1982 
show a severe trend 
<'011 1 i nued fnllll pa~e 1 
rapidly. with 16 times more 
significant quakes in 1976 that 
were recorded in 1940. M I. St. 
Helens provided only the most 
dramatic indication of an 
upsurge in volcaniC activity. 

Data gathered by numerous 
scientists suggest that all 
these phenomena could be 
linked to the earth's cCXJling 
trend. In 1977 an internat ional 
team of leading climatologists 
published a· paper in the 
prestigious British journal 
Natl/re. stating: "Our data do 
not how a reversal in the 
coo ling of the Northern 
Hemisphere." 

Nevertheless, much recent 
scientifi c peculation ha 
focused on a theory that 
predicts a warming of the 
planet. bringing :ignificant 

glacial melting and coastal 
flooding. The warm1l1g theory 
is built on the fact that human 
activity. particularly the 
burning of fossJi fueb-. ha 
increased C02 concent rat ion 
in the atmosphere, effectl\' el~' 
creat ing a "greenhou"e" 
which trap!-. heat from 
escaping into outer 'ipace. But, 
at least so far. no act ual 
measurements show such a 
warming in the Northern 
Hemisphere. 

In other words, there still 
may be too little C02 in the 
atmosphere to counteract the 
earth's cooltng and stave off 
glaciation. 

To understand why. a look 
back i helpfu I. 

For most of it hi ·tory, the 
earth was warmer than It is 
now. It was more densely 

foliated , oft en tropical ven In 
today's temperate latitudes-
and !Celes'>. e\'en at the pole ... 

By about ~OO million year ... 
ago, the great fore..,t. Jungle 
and oceanic organisms had 
become so fecund that the" 111 
a <'en<;e, brought on t hel r own 
destruction . In<;lead of 
recycling C02 Into the 
atmosphere, they trapped 111 in 
bogs and ~wamps , thereby 
produc1l1g toda,'s fosstl fueb 

Some geosClentl..,l<., theOrize 
that their burgeoning growth 
wit hdrew enough C02 from 
th atmosphere to weaken the 
greenhouse effect to the point 
where tanding ice could form . 
At that point theYlilanko\ltch 
cycles. v., hlch 111 pa t ages 
would ha\e merely moved the

Magnetic fusion advanced 
At the Lawrence Livermore 

National laboratory, a major 
and important engineering 
milestone was reached. to 
increase scient ist's confidence 
in building large magnetic 
fusion energy devices. In a 
series of tests completed Feb. 
4, 1982. the superconducti ng 
Yin-Yang magnet for the 
!Vtirror Fu ion Test Faci lity 
(MFTF-Bl, was tested at its 
full design operating current 
of 5,775 amps. This current 
flows through 31.3 miles of 
two C-shaped wou nd . 
interl cked co ils. 

The magneti c coib are 
immersed in liquid helium at a 
temperature of 4.5 K to reduce 
conductor electrical resistance 
to almost nil. 

During this demonstration 
run. the maximum magnet ic 
field at the conductor was 
77,000 gauss, which is about 
150.000 timesgreatenhan the 
average magnetic field at the 
eart h's surface. The magnet

One player says 'no' to sports violence 
conllllilcd frolll page :! 
tated violence within their 
realm . Over ight committees 
have been established, and 
tighter rule written . veral 
years ago. in fact, the HL 
assigned a game su pens ion 
penalty to the third man in on 
a fight - the very crime Paul 
Mulvey wa ' trying to avoid . 

Neverthele ", asserts 
Richard B. Horrow, sJXlrts 
violence has increased . 
Horrow, a lawyer now heading 
the Dade County port s 
Authority in Miami. contends 
that league warnings and 
sanctions have often gone 
unheard or unenforced. 
Moreover, he adds, the media 

have onl y heightened the 
pu blic percept ion of sports 
violence with their sensa· 
tionalism . 

It's been suggested that 
government take the initia· 
tive. In 19 0, Harrow, t hen a 
clerk to a U Di st rict Court 
judge, drafted an ill·fated, ill · 
conceived congressional bill to 
make excessive sports violence 
a federal crime. Since then, 
lhat bil),~ ~ponsor, Rep . 
Ronald Mottl CD,Ohio), has 
proposed more rea sona ble 
legislation mandating neutral 
arbitration pane ls to deal with 
the perpet rators on a ca"e·by· 
case basi s. As M u I vey 
discovered, however, dlscre· 

tion can make evcn the best-
intended safeguards meaning· 
less. 

It also may be unfair si mply 
to ass ign professional leagues 
and ath letes the task of 
policing themselves. Until 
Americans undergo some 
drast ic change, in t heir own 
approach to sport s, such 
measures tackle on Iy half the 
problem. 

From th little league fields 
to Madison Square Garden our 
own appreciation for sports· 
manship is rather confused. 
As spcctators, we'rc .a n 
unpredictable lot , chcerlng 
gracious gestures one minutc 
and near· homicide the next: 

W c lion izc t he bull ies as well 
as t he best. 

Coaches are expectro to 
ba lancc our dual passi()n~ . We 
count on t hem, like good 
generals, to prepare their 
troops for t he most bruising of 
batt les, and to achieve the 
winning. edge . 

But wc also ask t hem to be 
our moral forcc on the fi eld, 
even when high standards of 
fairn ss cou ld cost a coach his 
job. Obviously, Don Perry <;>f 
the L.A , Kings vie\ved hIS 
actions within the limits of 
discret ion. And some agreed 
with him. One Wins ton·Sa lem

a poli hed sound that features 
a blues tyle with high speed 
slide guitar and funk} bass

The thing that links thi" 
L.A, quartet with t he other 
bad boy . is t heir song cont ent. 
With tunes ' uch as .. he '", 
Like Heroin to Me" and 
"Gho ·t on the Highway" and 
lines like ''['m gonna buy a gun 
as long as my arm and kill 
everyone who has done me 
harm ," th('y prove they are 
just as pissed off as t he next 
group. 

With a little cleaning up and 
a change of attitude, the Gun 
Club could easily find a pot in 
th pop ma market, but 
they' re not in it for the money , 
right? inger / ongwriter 
Jeffrey Lee Pierce shows 
flashes of brilliance at times 
and then seems to let hi s voic 
and mind wander into a 

night mare of sounds and 
words. Picl ure ! he Prel enders 
playing twice as fas t and 
si nging about killing, drugs 
and assorted family enter-
tamment and vou would have 
a nice portrait 'of the exclusive

Seniur Staff \Vd'l~ r 
When t he Tritons fll1i shed 

fort y minutes of regulation 
play Tuesday evening at the 
Los Angeles Baptist gymnasi· 
um, the 94·88 score did not 
reflect UCSO's firs t half 
dominance, where the an 
Diegans left for intermission 
with a 58·47 advantage. To be 
honest, the 94 belonged to the 
Mustangs. 

To tag the con test as a 
" barnburner" is a gross 
understatement. Guards Tom 
Wight and Bob Goodman set 
I he pace with 38 tot al points in 
t he first half alone, and it 
appeared the ending had 
already been written. But as 
ha' been the casetoooft enthis 
season UCSU let their lead and 
the momentum escape. 

With ten minutes remaining 
on the clock, t he Tritons held 

tight with a nine point 
advanl age, but L.A. Bapt i"t 

r~n off six poin«.; imd caust'C1 
Triton headmaster John Block 
to call ti meoul. Followi ng I he 
brief rest t he lead was juggled 
b tween three and five IXlint s 
four times be fo r e th e 
Mustangs shaved it to one, R1· 
80. As the partisan crO\\'d 
representing a s t udent body of 
just over five hundred rose to 
t heir feet, th e Mu sta ngs 
recaptured the lead for the 
first time since the game 
started . 

Th e adva ntage jumped 
teams fi\'e times before time 
dwindled to 47 seconds, and 
the score was balanced at 86 
aiL Bet ween two timeouts and 
28 seconds, UC D forged an 
88·87 lead , but a~ the dock 
ticked down to fo ur seconds 
L.A. Bapt ist managed to clear 
the middle for Mark Staley, 

who fi nger·rolled the leat her 
in for two Ix)ints. 

Although [TCS [) had one 
opportunit y left. fI fullcourt 
pass hit the cei ling and ga\'e

'I he s t atis ti cs did not 
at all reflect the Triton df'frat. 
Wighl ended t he showdown 
wit h 2R points, game high for

In 1965, on a campus with 181 students, UCSD's 
Physical Education Department was fir t composed by -
and of - Dr. Howard Hunt, now chairman of the 
department. As the athletic program here ha increased in 
size and importance. so have the problem and concerns. 
UCSD now has. depending on the eason. 29 to 31 
intercollegiate teams (second only to MIT). 

To address these problems, Hunt, along with Athletic 
Director Judith Sweet, have devised an athletic advisory 
board to be composed of students, faculty, and staff. The 
idea behind the board has been approved by most of the 
people involved; athletic problems are of enough number 
and importance to warrent special attention, However, 
implementation of this idea has not been a simple matter. 
and though fir - t proposed last Fall, the committee has still 
not been formed. 

Intratnural playoff overview 

The purpo e of this board. officially entitled the 
Intercollegiate and Recreational Athletics Advisory 
Committee (IRAAC), is to review. evaluate, and make 
recommendations on problems of program policies. athletic 
conference affiliations, fiscal policies and program budgets, 
policies concerning the use of facilities, and any other 
athletic issues raised by the Chancellor or the P.E. Dept. 
Examples of issues to be handled might include whetheror 
not to charge admis ion for non-UCSD students at athletic 
events. how to best allocate the limited funds available, and 
whether or not to change to Di v. II tatu", in some sports. 

Four of the mne votmg members on thiS committee will 
be students, three will be faculty , and two will be staff. By LARRY GOLDMAN

With th intramural soccer 
playoffs just a few weeks away 
many people are specu lating 
which teams are going to come

rain t he playoffs wi ll start on 
Feb. '2.7.

Las t Chance crushed l litimat e

the AAA division wide·open 
si nce Last Chance has beaten 
Bong and Dongs but has lost to 
Fort un fl. 

In AA coed it i~ a different 
story. There are just two 

please turn to page 22 

Two faculty members are to be recommended by the 
Committee on Committees of the Academic Senate. The 
remaining faculty member, who will chair the IRAAC. and 
the two staff members are all appointed by the Chancellor. 
Along with these nine voting members are three ex-oificio 
members: the Chairman of the P.E. Dept. (Hunt), the 
Director of Intercollegiate Athletics (Sweet), and the 
Director of Campus Recreation (Kobayashi). 

No appointments to thecommity have ~'et been made. Dr. 
Joe Watson, Vice·Chancellor of Undergraduate Affair , 
who will be acting upon the committee's recommendations, 
has been instrumental in organizing the idea for the 
athletic advisory committee since it was proposed la t Fall 
by Hunt and Sweet. "Letters were ent out to the campu 
organi zations which must provide the necessary 
recommendation Dec. 1." Wat. on explained . "A of last 
week (ending Feb. 5), we had received no replies," he added. 

The only appointments made thu far are the faculty 
chairman (Dr. Hugh Bradner) and the two taff member . 
The delay seems to be caused by the campu organizat ion 
involved. As Watson explains, "As oon as they nominate 
the people, we're ready to go." 

According to Lynn Harris. Ass 't to the Chairman of the 
Academinc Senate, the Committee on Committee had met 
Monday and came up with their recommendations, which . 
will be sent in this week. 

Kobyashi reveals that the recommendations to be made 
by the Student Recreation GovemingBoard are complex. A 
representative of the Graduate Student Council could not 
be reached for comment. The AS is supposed to make the 
other two recommendations, and when a ked about the 
matter, AS PresidenUules Bagneris replied, "I do 't know 
anything about it," indicating that. so far, the matter has 
not been the hottest issue on the AS agenda .

Lacrosse blasts USC 
First-year club charges $100 to 
play, but it pays off with wins 

BY COTT YOUNG 
Dave Hammond and Scott 

Hill, former ly ' tudents at ri val 
San Francisco high schools, 
came to UCSD last September 
determined to play lacrosse. 
Unfortunately UCSD had no 
lacrosse team, nor anybody 
willing to coach one. Unfazed 
by this setback , the two 
freshmen set out to start their 
own team. 

" For the first couple of 
months, we did everything," 
says Hammond , co-captai n 
with Hill of the newe t 
intercollegiate s port on 
ca mpus. "We didn't have a 
cent ," he continued, "We sti ll 
don't. " 

After the first team meeting 
in October, the two began 
conduct ing in formal practices. 
"No goals, no nets .. .!t was a 
little bit discouraging after a 
while," Hammond shrugs, 
then continue ', "But I went to 
a league meeting, and made 
them believ we were more 
organ ized ... they bought it and 
we were in. Right then, we 
owed money." League dues 
and refere costs amounted to 
5280, a sum later provided by 
the A '_ 

hortly aftel attaining 
league membership, a game 
was set up with SDSU on ov. 
28 _ On player' s fath e r 
donated seve ra l hundred 
dollars worth of net and 

goals , and finally they found a 
coach. Larry, "The Beast" 
Good fellow, a bartender in 
Pacific Beach and four year 
vet ran of OMBAC's Lacrosse 
club volunteered to help them 
out. 

"Larry's kind of a hard -
nosed guy," Hammond says. 
" Hed sn 't liketolose_ lnfact, 
he hates lo -ing." Fortunately 
the team hasn't lost much . As 
for the first game with tate, 
Hammond say. , "Our team 
had half novices, guys who 
had never even seen a game 
before, and we killed them. We 
kicked ass, 7-2 was the final 
score. " 

THey al so beat Occidental 
Coli ge (5· 1) and U C (3-2). In 
a match last Thursday, tate 
came back to win 9-8, but "it 
wa - a very close game all the 
way," Hammond says. 

Each member of the UCSD 
team must be willing to put up 
about $ 100 from the 
beginning, ticks, helmet s, 
gloves, arm and shoulder pads 
are a ll nece ss ar y and 
expensive, " Invest a hundred 
dollars and then you'll have 
some fun," says Hammond 
wrily . 

Thi!-! 'at urday, the lacrosse 
team will be in action, against 
Whl1tier on Muir Field at 10 
a. m, tar mid fielder Yupi 
Kuhn and "game savi ng" 
goa lie Randy Kaufman will 
both be playing.

The intercollegiate skiing

Unlike other intercollegiate 
sports, snow skiers compete 
from all schools in Cali fornia 
under t he Cal ifornia In tercol-

of 71 6.58 poin ts, USC with
