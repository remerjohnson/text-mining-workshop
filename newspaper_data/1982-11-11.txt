The atrophy of athletics 
By JEFF AVAGE and MIKE GREENBERG 

taU Write rs 
"The UCSD Intercollegiate Athletics 

program is one of the most extensive in the 
country .. . students of varying interests and 
abilities have an open d()or to healthy, 
competitive athle! ic experiences. " 

The bald eagle, the whale, 
and the UCSD Intercollegiate 
Athletic Program all have one 
thl!1g in common. They are in 
grave danger of becoming 
extinct. 

UC D\ current operating 
budget for at hletics i a drop in 
the bucket in companson to 
other lJC system schools. 
Funds alloted for coachl!1g 
:alaries are miniscule and 
what is most distressing to 
student athlete. IS that the 
administration 's current 
philosophy promises to keep 
things the way they are. 

The overall athletIC budget 
for the 1982-83 fiscal year is 
, 284,000, which is 111 ufficient 
to adequately . upport a 
competitive intercollegiate 
program. When confronted 
with the problem in a recent 
interview, Vice-Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs Jo 
Wat on re ponded, "If you 
look at last year' budget, you 
wIll see a s ignificant increase, 
although I'm not sure what it 
wa ." 

Last year's budget was 
L7~,OOO, which marks a five 

thousand dollar increase for 
this year, not even enough to 
stay abrea'it of inflation. While 
Wa-tson'. knowledge of the 
SItuatIOn was somewhat 
lImIted, Chancellor Richard 

tkinson (al'io present at the 
ill t en le\\) ex preso.;ed con f u 
sion O\'l'1 the ent Ire Issue A~ 
Wat'ion was explaining tIll' 
brl'akdo\\ n of the (hstributlOn 
of III nds. At kinson leaned 
toward and queried. "8) the 
\\a\·. what committees are 
Im'()h'cd?" Watson explained 
that it \\as the ReglstratlOn 
Fee CommIttee that was bel!1g 
dIscussed. A fe\\ minutes later 
the Chancellor interrupted 
once agam. With a puzzled 
look on his face, h) asked.

Editor's Note: On Ihe day 
/JIlS issu(' went to press, the 

I (; lIaI'dian received copies 0/ 
no less than 28studenlletters 
addressed 10 the RegistratIOn 
Fee Committee. The leller.\, 
from athleles and nOll -
athietes alike, expressed 
concern over Intercollegiate 
Athletics JiOlding lind asked 
Ihe Com mil/ee to allocate 
more lu nds in response to 
student needs and desires . 

"Hey, what's the makeup of 
the Reg Fee Committee?" 

(The Chancellor IS in fact 
respon ible for the appoint 
ment of the Regi stration 
Committee's six faculty 
members who, combined with 
six student members, oversee 
the $5.8 million Undergrad-
uate Affair operating budget.) 

In concept, the Registration 
Fee Committee (headed by 
chairperson Gerri Hatten ) is 
to determine student Interests 
and distribute the Reglstra 
tlOn fee mone} accordingly. In 
a stunning contradIction of 
this, Watson later stated 
"What the students want is 
not the real question." 

From the Reg Fe commit-
tee' intercollegiate athletic 
allotment of $284, ,a total 
of $3 ,000 was distributed 
among 22 coaches, translating 
to an average salary of $1,900 
per coach. This compare with 
an average salary of $17,000 
for coache at all other UC 
chools. The small salary is a 

result of "mi classifying" 
coaches a. Recreation 

upervisors, enabling UCSD 
to not pay them for the actual 
number of hours worked. 

A UCSD coach work.., an 
average of 30-40 hour.., per 
week, devoting timc for 
preparat ion. sched u ling , 
practIce. tra\elling, and 
games. Incredibly. they are 
paId for only II hour: a week. 
When asked I f he felt t hat II 
hours a \\ eek \\as suffICIent 
tllne to produce a competitin' 
team. Watson replied, "r have 
absolutelv no Idea" 

In the spring quarter of last 
Yl'ar, Athlet IC I)lrector Judy 
:wcet requested an Increasl'of 
$9H.OOO to bring the coache'" 
salary budget total to 
$111.000. which \\ould have 
boosted the a\crage salan to 
$6,500. :weN (lut lIned t hl'

Here's to health! 
How many of you bow to the pressure of the social 

rcspon:ibility to join in on the nachos and 
margaritas? And how man y of you have skipped 
dinner in order to shde down a pint of rich and 

dl'liclou~ chucolall' fudge from Baskll1 I~()bl '\it'1 "?

Wrong. The damage done to a young b()d~' will 
ewntually take it. toll. A.nd because many students 
get very involved in the hectic campus lifestylc they 
neglect to exercise (J'll do some situp ' tomorrow ,\ hen 
J have more time"), and they eat whate\ er is available 
the quickest and easiest. 

taying healthy really is the most important thing 
ill life. For, what is life if you are not healthy enough 
to enjoy and experience it to the fullest potential? 

Healthy is beautiful , too. After all, Time Magazine, 
the eye of the country (one pair, anyway), did a cover 
~tory about thin and strong women being the "new 
ideal beauty." Especially in the traditional UCSD 
garb - shorts and tennies - the avoidance of air 
pollution is important. 

But too often, the easiest way to seenz healthy is 
relied upon. Too many people assume, "Well , I'm only 
"een in clothes anyway .. . " The truth is, we are all 
imple animal " and our only true possessions are our 

minds and our bodie ". Exercising our bodies can lead 
to feelings of enthu ' ia 'm, strength, and pride. 

Not only does eating ca refull y and exerci ing 
regularily tone mu. des in ide and out - from the 
heart to the thighs - it al 0 aids in maintaining 
mental health . Exercising is a great way to work out 
frustration. either from a st ressful dy or from the 
lack of confidence in some area.

We must not let the human species down now. Most 
can fmd food without hunting it down and the 
frontiers that most search out today arc those in our 
fantasies and imaginations, which often wecan reach 
from the li vi ng-room armchair. 

We have always been a nation and a species of 
ach Ievers and survivors, and wemust not let idle time 
and fast food destroy our drive to succeed, The 
<.,tudents of today are the movers and shakers of 
tomorrow. We must be ready to meet the challenge

I have been involved in a

s ure this is also true of 
UC D' s other athletic 
coaches. But the coaches 
s imply do not get paid enough 
and intrinsic sa tisfaction 
alone will not pay the bill s. It 
wouldn't be s urprising if our 
coaches uprooted and took on 
better ·paying pos itions at 
ot her schools because of the 
lack of fund s at UCSD. As it is, 
the Fencing T am has had 
four different coaches in the 
past four years; you can

J am writing to you in 
response to the letter written 
by the chair of t he Registrat ion 
Fee Committee. I think that it 
is very important to allocate 
more funds to the intercolle· 
giate athlet ic program . The 
grievous d ath of money that 
is the current case cannot 
persi t. Athlete s now 
contribute a great deal of their 
own money to participate, and 
have no alternative other than 
to spend tremendous amounts 
of time, that could be better 
spent in eith r practice or 
s tudy, raising money. If the 
current policy of non'stre&sed 
intercollegiate athletics is to 
be effective, there must be a 
way created so that the 
:tudent at hlete is not forced to 
spend huge amount!> of time. 
en rgy. and mone) in order to 
participate in the program 
which is mean t to be easy for 
anyone to JOIn.

TGs: telling the facts Veteran's Day, a time to reflect 
continued from page 3 
results in their as uming legal 
re ponsibility for the T.G. It is 
entirely po ible that these 
three could be individually 
sued, which would obviously 
result in great per onal 
expense. 

A main reason that the AS 
decided to temporarily stop 
serving beer wa to find a way 
to erve beer without being 
held Iia ble in the event of a law 
uit. 
Interestingly enough, even 

if the AS doe not serve beer, 
they are re pon ible for the 
alcohol that tudents bring in. 
(More legal tape to unwind.) 

An important fact that few 
tudent know is that if beer i 

not served, the money that 
would have gone for beer will 
go for more expensive band. 
This means that the price paid 
for a band wIll go from what it 
currently is (three hundred 
dollar -) to eIght hundred 
dollars for each T .G. 
Hopefully, this would mean 
bet ter musIc. 

The final decisIOn to sen'e 
lx.'er. a~suming it IS legall\' 

feasable, should be left to the 
st udents. As of yet, it is not 
clear what the , tudent · want. 
A petition was passed around 
to keep beer at T .G.'s, and was 
signed by many student -. But 
when a large group of students 
was told that money not pent 
on beer would be pent on 
band , almost all voted for 
more expen ive bands. 

The student's decision must 
be made with knowledge of all 
the facts, and alternatives 
concerning beer at T.G.'. 
Hopefully this letter helped to 
inform them. The A didn't 
stop beer becau e of some wild 
delu ion of power and 
deSpotism, but merely because 
it wanted to give itself time to 
examine the i ues. The AS 
Council exists toservethe be t 
intere t of the students. 
Please help them 'Jy letting 
them know your opinion. This 
can be done by talking to your 
college representative, coming 
to an A meeting, or by a letter 
expres~ 1I1g your \, iews.

gaining strength. 

The level of committment 
and re olve to solving these 
difficulties will only be 
succe ful if all Americans 
recognize the need to help the 
effort. The salute, which all 
Americans will witness 
between November 10th and 
November 14th, will demon-
st rate the depth of feeling that 
Vietnam veterans have toward 
each other. They will parade 
down Constitution Avenue in 
Washington, D.C . in units, by 
tates , with veterans' 

organizations and as indivi-
duals, finally ending the 
march at the Vietnam 
Vet ran Memorial. 

More than seven years after 
America officially ended its 
invol vement with Vietnam, 
she is finally paying tribute to 
her heroe who so valiently 
sacrificed themselves - their 
lIves or limbs. ft is about time! 
Let the dedi cat ion of the 
memonal be a mea ure of 
rerogn i t ion to t he Viet nam 
\I:'t\.'rans who stIli need our 

help and understanding. Don't 
let them down! Today there 
are efforts where veterans are 
helping veterans. As thankful 
Americans, we should all be 
thinking of ways we can help 
on thi s pecial day for 
Vietnam's heroe -. On a bunker 
wall in Khe Sahn, sera lied by 
an anonymous marine. were 
words that ring so true - "For 
those who fought for it, 
freedom has a flavor the 
protected will never know."

KhoDleni struggle 
Editor: 

Is it not amazing how 
courage and righteousness 
seem to stem from injustice 
and cruelty, how evil seems to 
give birth to good, and how 
beauty springs from ugliness. 
This is a story that has been 
repeat ed time after time 
throughout hIstory. This is 
th e storr of I ran under 
Khomeini S rule, and how 
brutal repressIOn and blInd 
terror is fueling an unshake· 
able quest for freedom . 

Violation of freedom of speech? The ne\\spaper~ on Frid<1Y , October 15, read: "Mojahedin commando embraces one of 
the Ayatollah 'a top men 
during th(, Friday Prayer and 
detonat es a grenade, killing 
himself and Khomeini 's close 
aid." The man killed was 
Khomeini 's key representati\e 
in Western Iran and was in 
fact direct ly responSIble for 
hundreds of arres t s and 
executions, and the ma ... sacre 
of the people of Kurdistan. 
llowever, not e\en these can 
exp lain wh~ a you ng man wi ll 
~i\t, his life to depose an il1lmg 
Avatollah. 

driving force behind thi type 
of courage and determination , 
one must experience the 
savagery and barbarism 
impo ed by Khomei ni on the 
Iranian people. One must 
think of the 20,000 innocent 
people who have been executed 
by Khomeini' s merci less 
regime during the past 16 
months. One must remember 
the 50,000 politica l pri soner~ 
who are curr nUr held In the 
fr a nlan jails undergOIn g 
constant and hrutal torture.

language of communication. 
They are not fixed by the 
\iewpoint of onr. culture. They 
arc not caught in the snare of

The photographer, Al ice 
Steinhardt. thinks we can see 
the world through new eyes. She 
does this herself by hand 
coloring her back and white 
photograph s. You can 
experience this view of a 
colorful life by visiting her 
exhibition at The Photography 
Gallery in La Jolla. 

Steinhardt 's work on display at Photography Gallery 

Steinhardt·s photographs 
have a simplicity and quality 
like Japanese Zen gardens. They 
are a marriage of form and 
color. Her hand-painted 
photographs are reminiscent of 
the moment just after sunset. 
when the setting sun splashes 
the grey clouds with orange. 
purple, and pinks. 

She focuses on the world of 
the ordinary. She poetically 
paints life into a seemingly 
lifeless scene. Revealing to us 
that if you look for the 
miraculous in common objects, 
you will find it. But first you 
need to train your eye to see. 

In the photo Genko. she 
hand -colors hundreds of 
individual leaves. She gives 
fresh springtime color to the 
genko, the oldest of plants. She 
establishes a personal contact. 
between herself and nature. 
nature and the viewer, and 
between the arti st and 
o urselves. 

I asked her how she relates to 
th e wor ld th r ough her 
photographs and the hand-
coloring process. 

" I chose photography instead 
of painting because, to me 
it is a more natural 
medium. Th e Camera can 
capture something that 
exists in the real world, At 
first the 'hand applied 
color' photograph appears 
like reality, until you see 
the subtlties. I do not like 
the lack of color control 
you have to deal with in 
regular color photog-
raphy. It cannot capture 
subtle color variations I 
sense in Nature. 

" There are so many 
images in the world. that 
you become immune to 
the things around you. We 
are but one among these 
millions of things. I try to 
focus on the heart-essence 
of a simple subject. 

" There is a tactile 
quality about the images I 
color. I like to retouch 
them. By retouching I mean 
that I repeat the experien-
cial moment of the origin al

After viewing the world 
according to teinhardt. I 
returned to the campus. f 
noticed a change in my 
perception . [\ ry leaf 
seemed to h;ne its own 
personality. The wood 
grain reliet on the 
concrete buildings were 
like lines of poetry. The 
muddy puddles below my 
feet reflected the early 

evening's red sky. 
Thinking back over the first 

year of exhibitions at The 
Photography Gallery. I real ize 
that photography is a 
meditative method we can use 
10 awaken our perLeptions and 
sensitivities. The photograph is 
a framed window to view the 
world of wonders. 

Photographs are our time 
machines. They take us into past 
events like the Civil War. They 
take us into the future through 
images transmitted back to us 
from the Voyager space mission. 

Photos capture the heroic 
and the humble. the tender and 
the terrible. the sensitive and 
the sensational. They perceive, 
receive and disclose the world 
to us. Our empathy is awakened 
to the sufferings and joy,) fo all 
peoples of the earth. Who can 
forget the blood stained face of 
Bobby Kennedy lying in a hotel 
halll\ay. Or thejoy on the fac of 
Olga Korbit when she won thc 
Olympic gold medal. Through 
these exposures lIe became 
involved with the concems of 
the world around us. 

Our snapshots " become 
personal awakenings. They act 
as cement betwcen the reality of 
a moment and our memo!) . 
Snapshots are condensed and 
highlighted pre tn'alions of 
those pedal moments in our 
lives. 

If photo joumalism is prose. if 
a snapshot is a personal note. 
then the gallery photograph can 
be seen as poetry.

Kurt Weill's Threepenny Opera. 
It is a selection fitting the 
occasion, one of the best loved 
works of one of the most 
controversial figures of modem

Most otten and typically in 
Threepenny Opera this is 
through satire. But Threepenny 
Opera is much more than satire. 
Kurt Weill's music alone would 
be sufficient reason to love the 
work and there are surely those 
of us who will leave the theater 
humming these tunes. 

Brecht was largely inspired 
by John Gay's The Beggar's 
Opera and he sought to go

proletarian conception of the

Alternative Ensemble's 
experiment succeeds 

B} JAN BKtslAUI.K 
[..)st weekend the Alll'rnativc 

Thcalr En~cmblc proved th 
merit of taking a ri~k. Their 
production of Stanhla\\ 
Witkiewicz' The Madman and 
tile Nun directed by John 
lymberg played quite capably 
to three very healthily sized 
audiences. The only regret may 
be that there weren 't more 
performance nights: the 
production was superior and 
certainly beyond that which was 
to be expected of such a young 
group. 

The strength of Lymberg's 
direction was his orchestration 
of many audio-visual elements 
into a powerful whole. The 
produciton enticed all of the 
senses into truly experiential 
theater: experimental film, 
penetrating sound, and 
incorporation of the audience 
qua guerilla theater, Technical 
and directional devices 

plorided IllJlllor dnd fliqued 
interest, (olllpicmentinq 
notable performancc by 
several of the principle actor~, 

Lymberg formed hl~ 
Alternative Theatre En~cmble to 
bring student artists from 
several disciplines together in 
the production of innovative 
theater. The Madman and the 
Nun was luckily only the first 
venture of this group and surely 
not the last. The ensemble has 
received funding from the 
Associated Students for its next 
production in the Winter, 

The benefit of the Alternative 
Theatre Ensemble is twofold: 
student productions outside the 
formal structure of the Drama 
Department provide more 
opportunities for actors and 
others to have major production 
roles, and students from several 
different departments work 
together.

Whatever 
happened 
to ~rt Rock' 

By KARL DA[GUNG 
Emerson, lake and Palmer. 

King Crimson. Yes. Genesis. U.1t 
All these bands evoke memories 
of swirling walls of sound, 

I instrumental virtuosity and expansive pieces that 
sometimes resembled classical 
music more than traditional 
rock and roll. These bands, 
sometimes labeled as "art rock" 
or "classical rock " bands, have 
all either disbanded or 
somehow changed their styles 
to produce a more lucrative 
sound, leaving a tremendous 
void in this area of music. 

Yes, one of the largest selling 
and most popular art rock 
bands, disbanded officially in 
1980 after the loss of key 
members Jon Anderson and 
Rick Wakeman in 1979, and the 
difficulty of touring with 
replacements Trevor Horn and 
Geoff Downes. Steve Howe, the 
poll-winning guitarist from Yes 
and former Buggies and Ye~ 
keyboardist Downes formed the 
group Asia along with other art 
rock mainstays Carl Palmer. 
former drummer for ELP, and 
former U.K. and King Crimson 
bassist John Wetton. 

Asia definitely has a more 
commercial sound than any of 
the material produced 

The orchestration of 
the past has been 
replaced by a comm 
erdal pop sound, 

previously by any 01 Its 
members, the empha~is 
seemingly on gaining radio 
airplay and big sales. 

I U.K., another more obscure 
art rock band, disbanded in 
1979, with members John 
Wetton going to Asia, drummer 
Terry Bozzio forming new wave-
ish Missing Persons and 
keyboardist Eddie Jobson 
leaving to work on studio 
projects. 

ELP, one of the biggest early 
and mid-seventies art rock 
bands, disbanded also, sending 
Palmer to A~ia, bassist and 
vocalist Greg lake off on 010 
projects and keyboardist 
extraordinaire Keith Emerson 
into the studio to write and 
produce movie soundtracks. 

The story is different with 
bands the likes of Genesis and 
King Crimson, Genesis, still a 
very popular band, has stripped 
down its sound to a more 
modern, accessible type of 
music a la the songs " No Replay 
At All " and Abacab ", from their 
latest studio effort entitled 
Abacab. King Crimson, the 
brainchild of guitarist Robert 
fripp, was disbanded for nearly 
four years until Fripp revitalized 
the band late in J 980. 

All this activity leaves us with 
a definite lack of the art rock 
sound. Is art rock dead? Quite 
possibly, un less it becomes 
fashionable to listen to again or 
becomes commercially 
lucrative for the artist. who 
mu t always look after his olVn 
interests. Music trends are ever 
changing, and it i possible that 
th{' art rock sound has faded 
away into oblivion.

has been billed as a comedy, but 
it isn't humorous. 

The storyline concerns a 
clergyman who is returning to 
England after 10 years among 
the natives of Africa, where he 
was teaching them about 
Christianity . 

The only problem I see with 
the film is that it was billed as a 
comedy. It seems that the 
publicity department at 
Columbia got a hold of the fact 
that Palin is a member of Monty 
Python, therefore the film must 
be strictly a comedy. Well. it 
isn 't, although there are some 
funny moments, especially one 
that people who saw Chariots oj

As Michael Palins first solo

promise, but it is not worth 
seeing as a comedy because it 
isn't one. Monsignor, on the 
other hand, is a piece of

Rush's 'Signals' for some life 

Tbe force behind Rush is drummer/songwriter Neil PearL 

Summers and fripp team 
up for a unique album 
I Aduanced Masked 
fripp lk Summers 
A & M Records 

By KARL DAt:<iUI'fG 
Usually when an artist from a 

major mainstream group 
releases an album on his own 
( i.e. Michael McDonald & Donald 
Fagen). he usually sticks to the 
genre that the group plays in 
(i.e. Jazz. Rock. New Wave), 

This a lbum sounds absolutely 
nothing like the Police. and 
certainly wasn't m eant to. I 
Advance Masked is essentially 
the sound of Robert Fripp. the 
guitar synthesist who 
masterminds King Crimson. 
Summers weaves his orchestral 
tapestries in amongst Fripp 's 
choppy. metronomic gu itar 
licks to present a very unique 

sound. both from a iistener's 
and from a musician 's 
standpoint. 

first of all. I Advance Masked 
is probably the best example of 
guitar synthesizer music on the-
market today; both fripp and 
Summers are Quite accom-
plished at manipulating the 
instrument. Second of all. the 
music is a unique blend of 
styles; the result is something 
that needs to be heard to be 
comprehended. 

If you are a Police fan. be 
warned - this is not the Andy 
Summers heard in the Police. 
Summers and fripp have 
produced here a fine guitar 
synthesizer album and a 
worthwhile one to check out if 
you are into alternative 
listening and experimental 
musi c. but don't expect 
anything like the Police. 

Signals 
Rush 
Polygram Records 

By MARK RUMER 
With the breakup ot Led 

Zeppelin complete. heavy metal 
fans have looked to a number of 
other bands to take up the slack, 
Rush. along with Styx. Journey. 
REO. and a few others have ail 
taken a piece of the market in 
recent years. Unfortunately. 
none of these groups has 
generated even a fraction of the 
excitement which the mighty 
Zep provided during the group's 
best years. 

Rush has put out a host of 
moderately high seiling albums 
in their nine years. but it was 
last year's Moving Pictures LP 
that gave the band heavy radio 
airplay and a substantially 
larger following. This Canadian 
trio has consistenly come up 
with records that offer only an 
occasionally punchy rocker 
accompanied by a lot of 
overblown filler. 

" Umelight." for example. off 
Moving Pictures. was a powerfu I 
and excellently perform ed 
number. On the same record. 
however, Rush wrote songs such 
as "Tom Sawyer." which are as 
meaningless and stupid as they 
come. This year's offering. 
Signals. is a complete waste of 
time for anyone involved with it 
or anyone listening to it. 

It's hard to describe just how 
bad this band really is. Start 
with the lyrics. Chief writer. Neil 

Pearl. ha5 always fancied 
himself as a mY'itical visionary 
who could unlock ')Om hidden 
universal phenomenon for all of 
us to discover. He ~ays nothing, 
however. and he docs it in a 
most excessive and stiff 
manner. Peart') constant 
metaphorical n:a~oning b too 
mu(h for even thc most tolerant 
to take. 

The music is no better. 
Guitarist Alex Lifeson plays with 
a flowing style that is 
occasionally interesting, and 
drummer Neil Peart is as speedy 
as ever. but Rush continues to 
rely on worthless synthesizer 
doodling and grandiose 
arrangements to compensate 
for an absence of challen~ing 
material. 

There are ~ery fe" listenable 
tra lli< s on this record . 
" Chemistry" b straight forward 
if nothing ehe. and Losing It' 
offers a chan~e of pace with it .. 
laid back format But that'5 it 
folk.,. The rest of the tllbum 
consists 01 typi<aliy pompous 
Kush eXl ('~.,('" which \\i ll 
<,trengthen the bdnd ., fM radiO 
audience and put the rest of us 
to sleep . Rush certainly has its 
fans, 

Let us not forget. however, 
that these are many of th sam 
people who wait in line six hours 
to see Ozzy Osbourne or 
foreigner. Signals will do 
nothing for Rush except make 
them some money and les.sen 
whatever uedibility they may 
have left.

Slo/l Writer& 
WHAT' GOING ON HERE DEPT, A dynasty at UCSD. 
The worn n's volleyball team, after Qualifying for the Nationals 
in 1979 and 1980, brought home a National Championship in 
1981. With repeated strong showings this season, the Tritons 
appear on th ir way to winning it all again this year. The future 
seems even brighter still, with the nucleus of the team reI urning 
next year. But the key ingredient is the man who has built the 
winning system - Head Coach Doug Dannevik. Rumors keep 
surfaci ng that if coaches' salaries are not increased, Dannevik 
will pack his bags and head elsewhere. It would be a great loss to 
the program, as well as to UCSD as a whole. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT, Football fever at West 
Virginia University i 0 high thi season that some fans thought 
the Mountaineers would beat Penn State. On the weekend of the 
game at Morgantown, the Delta Tau Delta fraternity planned a 
"funeral party" for the Penn State team. Penn State downed 
WVU 24·0, but that didn't spoil the party. That duty was left to 
the Morgantown resident who noticed in the Delta Tau Delta 
yard a silk flower arrangement that had been on her son's grave. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. In Monday's Sports Line article, 
Mona·Loui e Hyre and Nadine Mack were definitely correet in 
addressing the distre sing state of affairs of the Athletic 
Department. However, one comment detracted from the overall 
credibility of their argument. Using the quote that "it seems odd 
that a school which prides itself on being the most sports·m mded 
campus in America .. . " is not onl y incorrect , but grossly 
exaggerated. UCSD excels in academics, it is one of the nicest 
places to live, and the mtramural program may e\en be 
considered superior to that of most ot her major univer"'ltle", but 
to use the quote I hat Uc. D IS one of "t he most SJX)rt ... mmcled 
cam puses in America" is ludicrou~. 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT, Nt'\\ York ba ... eball fan .... 
Two rea~(ms t hat Yankee 0\\ ner George Stem brenner will rehirc 
Billy Martm for the third time. One, sothat Ceorge \\ III recei\'ca 
lot of pubhClty and media ex posure for hiring Rill y, and tIn). all 
the publicity and media attention George \\'111 obtain for firing 
Billy. 
QUOTE EXTRAORDINAIRE DEPT. aid Tony Eason, 
the IIhnois quarterback who engineered a la"t mmute drive that 
produced the game·wmning field goal in a 29·2 victory over the 
Wisconsi n Badgers, on his ability to stay cool under pressure:

By MICHAEL BROWN What UCSD does have a

Against Cal State Long Beach,

winning easily 9·2. Playing the

UCSD gets into UltiInate 
By ALEXIS WAADT 

It was a grey Saturday morning in Irvine, California, site of the 1982 Ultimate Frisbee 
Western Regionals and the UCSD women were there. These members of UCSO's Frisbee 
Clu b, better known in the "plastic" world as Blacks Beach Ultimate Entropy, were psyched 
for this all important tournamen t. It wa a wild scene as men's and women's teams from 
eleven states were there to compete for the chance to go to Nationals later this year. One 
UCSD spectator commented , "Lots of good disc wa tossed at the Regionals. For those who 
merely stood by and watched it was an exciting tournament full of upsets. The San Di~o 
teams made a good showing, despite the absence of the always honorable BBVE (men s) 
sq uad." 

The energy of Entropy was high as they defeated the Ulti·mates in a clo e game. Their 
second and third games against Oregon's Dark Star and Santa Cruz's Cruz Control were 
well played. though not victorious. Nine women's teams from all over the West were 
present, and t hree of those were from San Diego. I othe Spinoffs and Flo. two men's teams 
made an appearance. The Spinoffs were beaten out of a semifinal spot by the two teams that 
ma~e it to the nationals: Berkeley' FlyingCircus. dressed in full Halloween rega lia, and the 
IrvmeMud Sharks. The Lady Condor were al so unseated by Dark lar. Theresu ltsoflhis 
tournament were a boost for the already high ene rgy Entropy women. l'hey are now fully 
psyched for the upcoming year , as they practice harder than ever to full v develop the 
potential they showed this weekend. .

Karen Silkwood was last seen alive leaving a 

unton meeting in Crescent, Okla., on 
November 13 1974. Witnesses say she climbed 
into her Honda Civic clutching a brown manila

safety violations at Kerr-McGee nuclear facility 
in nearby Cimarron. She was on her way to 
turn the information over to a national union 
leader and a reporter for the New York Times . 

But she never made it. Her car , was found 
crumpled against a highway abutment a few 
miles away, her lifeless body pinned to the 
driver 's seat. The folder vanished ...

'. 

The preliminary season is now over. 
But before I move on to the playoff 
preview I would like to pay tribute to all 
you 1M football teams who didn't make 
the playoffs. For every winning team 
unfortunately there has to be a losing 
tream. These losing teams are the ones 
who really understand the spirit of 1M's. 
It's not easy to gf) out week after week 
and come up empty. 

I have noticed that teams have 
different ways of handling the inevitable. 
Take the team 'One L3St Hurrah'. Now I 
don't know if that mt:ans that they're all 
seniors ready to graduate or that when 
the game IS hopelessly lost, as it usually 
was, they call time-out to go finish off 
those big silver barrels filled with some 
yellow looking liquid. Then there IS the 
squad appropriately named 'Rock Pile'. 
These guys knew they weren't going to 
win the championship. But you sure as 
heck better be ready to lay against these 
guys. They usually put their stamp on an 
OPPOSing team, called bruises. The med 
school squad called 'MediCine Balls' had 
an interesting motto. At 1-4 they needed 
something to keep them going. Their 
motto was, 'Take advantage of us now 
cause we're going to take $ advantage of 
you later." The coed team 'Lumps of 
Matter' had a tough time in their league. 
They would go out every week and get 
blown out by the oposing team. They 
couldn't understand how come they 
were loSing so bad since they had 
thought they had pretty good talent at 
the begining of the season. Well, it turns 
out that they were a Single 'A' team in the 
toughest 'M ' coed league. This is called 
reverse sandbagging. 

The special 'Spirit of IMs' award goes 
to the team 'White line Fever'. What's so 
special about this team? Well, thiS was 
the only team out of 150 men's and coed 

FOR ALL YOU DO ... THIS 
BUD PAGE IS FOR YOU! 

intramural football teams who did not 
score one single itty bitty point the 
whole season. Imagine that. Even 

North~tern scores a point once in a 
while, Rumor has it they were close a 
couple of times to scoring. Once they 
thought they ahd a touchdown for sure. 
Only problem was the guy who scored 
the touchdown on White Line Fever' 
was running north instead of south. He 
kept wondering why the opposition was 
throwing so many wonderful blocks on 
his teammates who were trying to stop 
him from scoring. The only other time 
they were close to scoring was when the 
QB threw to a wide open receiver in the 
end zone. Wrong again, fellas. The 
receiver was wearing a striped shirt and a 
whistle around his neck. Well, anyway, 
this team sure Showed the true spirit of 
IMs showig up every week. The most 
important point of IMs is to participate 
and enJoy yourself. It isn't the Super Bowl 
they're competing for. 

But let's not get too carried away. I'm 
right. It's not the Super Bowl you're all 
competing for. It's more important than 
that little game. It's the Animal Bowl, the 
Banana Bowl, the Cadaver Bowt, the 
Climax Bowl and the Soul Bowl. These are 
THE bowl games for those players and 
fans of 1M football. These bowls are the 
culmination of many weeks of practice, 
cutting labs, miSSing your high school 
homecomings and your old girlfriend, 
telling the professor your grandmother 
died and that you can't take the mid-
term because of it, and trying to get the 
refs on your side by buying them beer at 
the Pub. yes folks. This is it. Playoff fever. 
That means it's time for me to go out on 
the limb once again and pick the 
winners. You know the Budman Is rarely 
wrong.

Comments: look for Bong Water wtth tremendous overall balance between their 
male and female players to make a strong bid for their first AAA title. Perennial AAA 
powerhouse SKLIF still has the plethora of male Slingshots but may be miSSing their 
usual female firepower this year. Bet bet for a darkhorse entry are season-long 
Number 1 rated Floaties.

Comments: ThiS Will easily be the most hotly contested diVISion In the waterpolo 
play-offs With at least 4 teams given a seriOUS chance to swim off With the gold. 
Sandbaggers supreme, Aqua Cows and More Wet Foxes, have the InSide track but 
there's a couple of giant sleepers in the pack stili to be heard from. Best darkhorse 
bet might be Brain Damage.
