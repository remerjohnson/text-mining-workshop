Gardner's Pension, Regents Under Fire 
• Members of State Senate and A embly call 
for investigation of benefit for DC lead r 
By Melinda Hamilton 
Senior Staff Writer 

Under the threat of legal a tion. 
the UC Board of Regents po ·tponed 
until today a meeting on UC Presi-
dent David Gardner' s controversial 
everance package which had been 

hastily scheduled for last Thursday. 
UC President David P. Gardner 

called last week's meeting to dis-
cu hi severance package for his 
retirement, which is planned for 
October. 

At a Mar. 20 meeting, the regents 
approved a everance package to-
taling nearly $2.4 million, accord-
ing to some e timate . The regent 
have come under fire for the pack-
age, especially in the wake of in-
creasing fee increases for students 
and cuts in pay for faculty and staff. 

At the ame time. two California 
state senators called for an audit of 
the regents' activitie concerning 
benefits awarded to top-level UC 
administrators dating back to 1983. 

Regent Jeremiah Hallisey, a San 
Francisco attorney. filed charge 
Tuesday for a temporary re tmining 

orderagainst the meeting being held 
Thursday. California tatc enator 
Quentin Kopp (I-San Fmncisco) 
functioned as Hallisey's attorney, 
citing inadequate n tice time ami 
lack of a !.pecific agenda:.L'; reasons 
for the filing of the suit. 

Halli ey alleged that the late an-
nouncement of the meeting was" an 
attempt to marshal regent support 
and to prevent student unrest." 

Kopp said in a telephone inter-
view Friday that the suit was filed 
Wednesday night and a hearing was 
set for II a.m. Thursday morning. 
After receiving n tifi ation of the 
rescheduling of the meeting 
Wedne day night. Kopp can elled 
the hearing. 

Kopp, along with State Senate 
Preside nt Pro Tempore David 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles), also filed 
a requet with the office of State 
As emblyman Robert Canl pbe II (0-
Richmond) to perfonn a full audit 
into the regents' activitie concern-

a confidential regents meeting to

the regents' discussion on whether 
or not to publicize the details of 
Gardner's severance package: 

U[The information] will be released 
whenever someone asks for it 
under the Public Records Act and 

it may be that the administration will choose to release it at 
some earlier time .• 

- Regent Dean Watkins 

UHas anyone given any thought as to how we might mitigate 
the effect of this by organized release or some type of a 
businesslike approach? If the Legislature gets a hold of this, 
the numbers that we're kicking around ... it's very hard to 
reconcile. ~ 

- Regent Frank Clark 

UMy political judgement says don 't do it now .... Take a little 
poll informally, Mr. Chairman, and say that everybody is 
happy except one or two, then take action next September .•

Gore Vidal Addresses Campus on America's Future 
• Vidal says monothei tic religions are hannful to 
women and minorities, imply racism of believer 
By Stephanie Danford 
Staff Writer 

''I'm not interested in people's 
private beliefs," author and social 
commentator Gore Vidal told a 
crowd of students, faculty and com-
munity members at the Mandeville 
Auditorium Thursday night. "What 
they put into our laws, that make 
me edgy," he said. 

The major theme of Vidal's lec-
ture, titled "America Fi rst?.. 
America Last? ... America At Last?" 
was the intrusion of religion into 

civil law in the United States. 
The most obvious penetrations 

ofreligiou ' beliefintopublicpolicy, 
Vidal said, wereevident in hi~tory's 
record on attitudes toward racial 
issues and toward women. Accord-
ing to his theory on the teachings of 
monotheism, three major monothe-
ist religion emerged from the Old 
Testament: Christianity, Judail>m 
and Islam. Vidal labeled these the 
"Sky God" religions. 

According to Vidal,observersof 
"Sky God" religions place one god 

at the center of existence with men, 
but never women. on Earth us his 
servants. In addition, the Old Testa-
ment, Vidal said, implies the inferi-
ority of nonwhites and "ra ism is in 
the marrow of the bone of the be-
liever." 

Vidal said he uses the term "Sky 
God" to "explain why we have the 
laws we have;" forexanlple, he said 
manipulation through "Sky God" 
churches impact lawmaking. 

"I would say liveand let live, and 
not scc>ff at the monotheists, but I 
can't. They won't let me;' he said.

" It was the biggest civil liberties rally in the history of 
America," said UCD student Garren Goffstein, who is 
participating in the UCD Washington Program. 

"'The atmosphere was really incredible. You couldn't 
help but be totaUy overcome by Americanism. It was a 
good example of our politicaJ system," Goffstein said. 

UCD student Tamera Hewett-Vallejo agreed. "It was 
so cool. It was packed. There was so much electricity." 

Goffstein said that the UCD students did not actually 
march in the Capitol but panicipaaed by selling about 
$20,000 in T-shirts to help NOW cover the $500,000 debt 
it accrued. 

With both the Roe Y. Wade decision and the Freedom of 
Oloice Act pending in the Supreme Court and Congress, 
the crowd was overwhemingly pro-choice with fewer than 
200 abortion opponents in attendance. 

Because many pro-choice activists expect Roe \I. Wade 
to be overtumed by the conservative SuprerneCourt, many 
protestors at the rally switched their focus from the Su-
preme Coun justices and aimed their speeches and signs at 
political candidates vying foroffice. Goffstein said NOW's 
goal was to send a message to President Bush.

Reaction Mixed to UC Davis Sexual 
Harassment Charges AgaInst Band 

After a press conference detailed and publicized allega-
tions of sexism and hazing within UC Davis's Cal Aggie 
Marching Band, reaction to the band at both the Picnic Day 
parade and the Battle of the Bands was mixed. 

Many said the graphic infonnation released at the press 
conference made them think twice about the allegations. 

"I think the band is a good organization, but it needs 
revamping, different leadership and a change of philoso-
phy," said UC Davis student Amy Schulz, who said she 
was "shocked" by the alleged harassment. 

According to Sociology Professor John Scott, the letter 
released at the press conference was "raunchy." but he 
said, "You have to put it in the context that scandalous and 
irreverent behavior has been around for decades in colle-
giate bands." 

Scon also said that because the band is voluntary "no 
one is compelled to join the band and hazing for volunteers 
is part of the bargain." 

Others supported Julie Graham, who accused the band 
of harassment, for standing up and publicly fighting the 
alleged Se}(ism within the band. 

"I think if s appalling, and I'm proud of the woman who 
spoke up," said Davis resident Melissa Shutta.

BENEFITS 
ContInuecllrom paee 1 
dent since 1983. Campbell is the 
chair of the joint legislative audit 
committee. 

"Every couple of days some-
thing [scandalous] occurs," said 
Kopp, citing as e}(amples the poli-
cies of paying an amount equal to 
five percent of presidents' and chan-
cellors' salaries to their spouses. 
and awarding top-level executives 
medical insurance~f up to $200,000 
without a medical examination. 

"I think it's a disgrace to have the 
regents gobbling up benefits," Kopp 
said. 

Kopp also said he heard from 
"very reliable sources" that Gard-
ner might not wait until October to 
step down. but may make his resig-
nation effective immediately. 

According to Kopp, Campbell's 
office should make a decision on the 
audit Wednesday. If approved, such 
an audit would take months and 
would not be legally binding, ac-
cording to Kopp. Changes in the 
legislation or a taxpayers' lawsuit 
were only two of several scenarios 
Kopp described. 

Rescheduled to take place today 
at 3 p.m., the meeting conceming 
Gardner's pension was originally 
announced in a vaguely-worded 
press release 50 minutes after the 
72-hour previous notice deadline 
required by the Education Code. 
Meant originally to be a regents-
only session, the meeting will now 
be open to the public. 

Critics have accused the regents 
of approv ing the package in secret, 
a charge panially substantiated by a 
now-public transcript of a Mar. 19

meeting of the Subcommittee on 
Officers' Salaries and Administra-
tive Funds. 

In the confidential trdIlscript, 
leaked to the Sacramellfo Bee and 
the San Francisco Chronicle last 
week, the regents present at the 
meeting discussed withholding the 
detail of Gardner's severance pack-
age until September. after the June 
deadline for the state budget had 
passed. 

Many of the regents expressed 
concem atthemeetingover the con-
sequences of releasing the infonna-
tion immediately, fearing a public 
relations nightmare in light of the 
current fee increases and holds on 
faculty and staff salaries. 

"There are no little secrets in our 
game - in my little life in Sacra-
mento there never were, and this 
will somehow get out and it is a 
public record," said Regent Wil-
liam Bagley, who worked on devel-
oping the severance package and 
advocated waiting to release details 
of Gardner's pension. A few of the 
regents advocated holding off on a 
fOmlal vote until after the budget 
approval deadline in June. 

Fearing repercussions when the 
news became public, the transcript 
quotes Bagley as suggesting hold-
ing off on taking action until the fall. 
"To do it now is absurd, my friends," 
he is quoted as saying. 

Vice Presictent of Administra-
tion Ronald Brady disagreed, say-
ing, "David [Gardner] has expressed 
his view strongly to many of us in 
private conversation that he thought 
this was the right time to do this." 

"I think we ought to take this 
action, g~ it over and done with. ( 
do not like the idea of saying 'yes, 

The UCSD Guardian 

we're going to do it but let's not do 
it until October, '" said Regent Dean 
Watkins. a Palo Alto businessman. 

According to the transcipt , the 
discussion turned to if and how the 
infonnation should be released. A 
few regents suggested that the legis-
lature as well as the press would be 
interested in the infomlation. 

"I have had two legislators in the 
last six months ask me personally 
what is really the total compensa-
tion of the president." said Regent 
Tirso del Junco at the meeting ... ( 
think there is a lot of interest there. 
particularly with all of these thing 
going on. and we are going to get 
questions and we hould be pre-
pared," 

TIle transcript contains the mo-
tion to approve the severance pack-
age, butthequestionofreleusing the 
infonnution is not resolved. 

A fact sheet was made public 
after the two-day meeting con-
cluded, but made no mention of the 
dollar amounts involved. saying only 
that vesting dates had been estab-
lished and his offer to remain as an 
unpaid consultant for three years 
had been accepted. 

The money for Gardner's sever-
ance package will come from state 
retirement funds and from the Gen-
eral Endowment Pool. 

According to Kopp, money from 
that pool can be used for anything, 
including funding more classes and 
increases in pay for facul ty and taff. 

"I want to assure the students I 
will fight cuts in the budget and 
assist in rescinding actions which 
cost money and courses," Kopp said. 

State Senator Robeni and As-
semblyman Campbell were unavail-
able for comment Friday. 

NEWS 3 

ERRATUM 
In the April 16 issue of the Guardian, an article titled "Election 

Ballots to Be Sealed" incorrectly presented Judicia l Board Chair 
Gloria Corral's statement concerning the recent A.S. elections. 

The article stated that if A.S. presidential candidate Ruben 
Duran successfully pursued his charges against fellow candidate 
Mike Holmes. "Holmes would also have the option of withdrawing 
from the race or being removed from the ballot. • 

It was also stated that if Duran's complaint of election 
mismanagement against election manager Jennifer Aaim was 
successful. the presidential election would be nullified. 

These options were not intended to be presented as the only 
options available. Since the hearings have not yet been held, no 
outcomes can be predicted.

ExpOSING THE 11ANY MITHS OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT 
By Matthew Robinson 
Senior Scaff Writer 

Condemned murderer Roben Alton 
Harris has been abused hi whole life. He 
developed as a fetus in the womb of an 
alcoholic mother. His father phy ically 
abused him. And most recently. he has 
become the convehient vehicle for those 
who are again t capital punishment. 

There are those people who wish to 
focus on the life of Robert Alton Harris in 
order to advance their own agenda about 
capital puni. hmem. Hi tragic life as a chi ld 
has become the perfect ally in a movemenl 
which first begins with an aversion to 
capital punishment amt then advance to 
finding out the fact. 

Justice, not misdirected pity, needs to be 
considered in death penalty cases 

Like many cases of crime in this 
country. Hani • crimes have elicited a 
battery of lawyers. psychologists. and 
"experts" who have assened that he is not 
guilty. The resounding tragedy of his life is 
used a an excuse for two murders that 
were perpetrated wilh premeditation and a 
cool meticulousnes for details. To these 
people. Robert Alton Harris was never a 
responsible human being - he is always a 
"patient." 

Now. I do not wish in any way to 
diminish the adne s and hun ofHarri ' 

Ii fe. But ju tice must eventually enter the 
picture in any discussions of capital 
punishment. For this is not just a case of 
Harris life, but a battle against capital 
punishment. Ajury has convicted Harris by 
the procedures and proper means of law 
and justice_ Founeen years have passed as 
an un ure justice system plagued by legal 
and technical opposition has put obstacles 
in the path of the justice_ 

Some people wish to assert that the 
intermittent years and legal costs are an 
argument against capital punishment. Myrlr 

#1 : For of{ rlre rime OIld cosr ro execllle Mr. 
Harris. we could "ave kepI him ill prison 
for life. This argument from cost is. of 
course, ridiculous - especially since it is 
advanced from the same mindset that has 
produced the 14 years worth of obstacles_ 
Justice has been injured by all the ideologi-
cal attempt to frustrate the workings of the 
law and democracy. 11le latest restraining 
order is merely another gambit defeating 
the law and a further example of what is 
wrong in our legal system. Ideologically 
charged legal mercenaries are using the 
complexity of law againsl juslice. instead of 
in its service.

COMMENTARIES 

Capital punishment is 
institutionalized 
retribution, not justice 

CapIbII Pal .............. In u.s. don't want to get any fan mail grilling me about how I 
would feel ifmy family were murdered. My response to 
such an asinine line of questioning would be, "I would be 
very sad_ And you?" 

In 1976. the U.S. Supreme eM permitted States to reslJ11e 
eJeCUtiQns. The followil1 are stales that use capital 
pooishment and the number of people who have been 
executed: TIle last attempt of Harris' lawyers at clemency was on 

the basis of his having been abused as a child. as well as 
having suffered organic brain damage from Fetal Alcohol 
Syndrome_ By CIWtopMr Conway Staff Writer 

"Capital punishment is not useful because of the 
example of cruelty which it gives to men," wrote Cesare 
Beccaria in 1764. in a beautifully srated and still relevant 
attack on stale-sponsored murder. "If the passions or the 
necessity of war have taught people to shed human 
blood," Beccaria wrote in 011 Crimes alld Pullishmellls. 
"the laws thai moderate men's conduct ought not to 
augment the cruel example. which is all the more 
pernicious because judicial execution is carried out 

formally and methodically". 
Roben Alton Harris was 

Governor Wilson. upon turning down Harris' request 
for clemency, stated his compassion for Harris the abused 
child but not Harris the man. who seemed to not be brain 
damaged enough to carry out thoughtful and intelligently 
premeditated crimes. including murder. 

I wiU not debate these issues_ Medical and psychological 
data. in silUruions such as these. are as pliable as statistics to 
anyone with an agenda and a motor-mouth_ Harris' lawyers 
are only doing their vel)' best to save their client.

TIle real question is whether capital punishment itself 

is a viable oplion for countries that accustom 10 call 
themselves civilized_ 'The issue of deterrence was once an 
issue. back in the seventies and early eighties_ Pro- and 
anli-capital punishment studies competed for statistical 
hegernony in a back and fonh manner.

Murdering the

tty to empathize with the 
families of the victims, but we 
fail dismally. We realize that 
nothing shon of experiencing 
such a catastrophe ourselves 
could open us up to the agony 
of losing a loved one to 
murder_ 

Under these ellcruciating circumstances, I can under-
stand why these families embrace capital punishment, an 
institutionalized act of vengeance, as justice. 

Supporters of the death penalty have always been 
quick to throw the proverbial "what if your family had 
been massacred" at those of us who oppose capital 
punishment, as well as the equally frequent "you just 
don't know how it feels" line. Now. this is not the real 
substance of the reasoning behind a pro-capital punish-
ment person's arguments. It is an emotional reaction and 
invariably the first sortie, albeit a shallow one, against 
people like me. 

I do not frame my opinions and beliefs about what is 
just on the basis of what has or has not happened to me or 
will happen to me. I am nOI. nor do I plan to become. the 
center of the uni verse_ If the tenns "morality" and 
"justice" are to retain any semblance of integrity in our 
usage, they must transcend an emotional and individual 
reaction to a trauma

Both sides have given up this premise of trying to 
scientifically prove whether or not death by execution 
frightens others from committing crimes. Since the death 
penalty is scarcely used and never witnessed by those 
predisposed to go on murder sprees. deterrence is not 
really an issue. 

What it boils down to is retribution. Those in favor of 
frying, gassing or overdosing human beings in the name 
of just retribution argue that since lhe criminal has taken 
human life. he or she gives up her right to life. 

Who said that? It was not Jesus Christ. that 's for sure. 
Jesus was a teacher that recognized that purity and 
goodness was not a result of one human being's superior 
ability to judge another. or punish another. 

Why have a God. or a Higher Order to subscribe to if 
humans have all it takes to figure it out for themselves? 
(By the way, please tune in next week for the flood of 
letters to the Guardiall from Christians anxious to give me 
a punitive lesson in theology.) 

Harris did not give up his right to life at the hands of the 
state for commiting murder. That right is not petty enough to 
be bought and sold by a countty thai sanctioned the indis-
criminate destruction of innocent civilians in Panama and 

~. . 
It is not small enough to be paraded around like a 

possession of those too enrunored of sel f protection to see 
the bitter crops they have sown. 

1he social problems we so eagerly want to tackle with 
violence and incarceration are not bom out of evil. TIley are 
the drainage pipes of a system that does not want to see what 
it does to the world of people and things around itself. 

Murdering the criminal will not bring back his or her 
victims_ Murdering the criminal will not heal the wounds 
of the loss of a loved one. Murdering Ihe criminal is 
criminal. You don't need a church building to know this; 
great spiritual teachers have all spoken about how very 
small and very great we all are. By sanctioning the murder 
of Robert Alton Harris. we are killing a part of ourselves. 

CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ISN'T JUSTICE SERVED BLINDLY 
By ....... CGIIer 
Senior Staff Writer 

Whenever Robert Alton Harris is 
eventually executed, there are three San 
Quentin prisoners who in the near future 
may share Harris' fate_ Interestingly, all 
three men are black. According to the 
California Attorney General's office, 
Edgar Hendricks, Melvin Meffrey Wade 
and Bernard Lee Hamilton all have cases 
far enough in the appeals process to be 
considered "next in line." 

I have no objection 10 the death 
penalty, but I do have an objection to how 
it is implemented_ The way capital 
punishment is used today it places an 
unfair and arbitrary value on Iife_ If a 
black kills a white the probability of the 
offender gelling the death sentence is 
higher than that of white on white murder. 
If a black kills a black, the probability of 
recieving the death is so low it is almost 
neglible, though it is still much higher 

Race should never be a factor when judging 
the value of human life 

than the probabilily of a white offender 
who has killed a black. To say it simply 
for all the white readers oul there, you can 
rest easy knowing your life is valued more 
than a black life like mine_ 

It is probably a lot easier for jurists and 
judges to send blacks to their deaths for 
the simple reason that many whites 
consciously or subconsciously view all 
blacks as criminals. 

We African-Americans have never 
been viewed as real Americans_ In the 
eyes of whites we are simply foreigners 
and the enemy. A black man is born a 
suspect_ No mailer where he goes - no 
matter how uccessful he may become -
he will always be considered a suspicious 
character. The police will always stop him 
when he is in the "wrong" neighborhood, 

clerks keep a wary eye on him when he 
enters their businesses, white women will 
always be nervous in his prescence. 

It is easier for judges and jurists to 
look at the white killer and feel sympathy. 
After all. that white offender isn't a 
foreigner in their eyes- he's one of 
them. There's always that hope because 
he is one of them that he ' ll change his 
ways. And that makes all of the 
diffference_ 

You'll always give one of your own a 
second chance - Robert Alton Harris got 
a second chance, and he murdered again. 
How many black offenders are so lucky? 

Am I saying that just becau e someone 
is black they should be forgiven of their 
crime? Of course not. Everyone should 
be held accountable for the crimes they 

commit. But unfortunately we have a 
system that makes people who are 
different more accountable for their 
crimes. 

The solution? If we can ' t implement 
the death penalty justly and fairly to all-
then maybe we should scrap it until we 
can judge all people justly without all of 
the cultural baggage attached. 

The day our justice ystem can truly 
judge people like our idyllic image of 
Justice and her scales, will be the day I 
can fully support capital punishment. 
Until then, I can't. 

Which brings us back to Roben Ahon 
Harris. To be honest. I can't say I feel 
orry for the predicament he has gOllen 

himself into. 
But at the same time a question begs to 

be asked: If Roben Alton Harris had 
killed two black boys. would he be on 
death row today? And sadly the an wer is: 
probably not. 



6 OPINION 

DEATH 
ContInued from .... 4 
specifically murder. While this 
seems to be a conunon sense state-
ment, a closer look reveals that this 
is not the case. 

Most murders are crimes of pas-
sion or committed under the influ-
ence of drugs or alcohol. A person 
in an uncontrolled rage. whether or 
not that person is under the influ-
ence of drugs, is not likely to con-
sider the possible consequences of 
his or her actions. 

States that use the death penalty 
most frequently have shown thai 
there is no deterrent value in its use. 
Texas, Rorida, Lou isiana and Geor-
gia. the states with the highest num-
ber of execUlions, have the highe t 
murder rates. Texas has executed 
45 people since the reinstatement of 
the death penalty there in 1976. The 
murder rate (the number of murders 
pertotal population, which account 
for changes in the population) has 
risen steadily each year since 1976. 

A recent British Royal Commis-
sion on Capital Punishment study of 
seven European countries and three 
non-European countries reponed no 
evidence that the abolition of the 
death penalty resulted in higher 
murder rates. 

The 1988 Report to the United 
Nations Committee on Crime Pre-
vention and Control concluded that 
its research "has failed to provide 
scientificproofthmexecution have 
a greater deterrent effect than life 
imprisonment. " 

Death penalty advocates often 
use recidivism as a nllionaJe for 
capital punishment. The thought of 
a killer escaping from prison only to 
kill again is, without question, a 
nightmare. However, actual escape 
frommnximum-securilY prison an:: 
incredibly rare. 

Moreover, according to crimi-
nologist Thorsten Sellin, le 's than 
31 hundredths of one percent of 
paroled murderers kill again. Parol-
ees who were convicted of crime 
otherthan muruerare farrnore likely 
to kill after they have been released 
from prison. 

If the argument that we mu t 
execute murderers to prevent them 
from killing again is used. then the 
next logical step would be to ex-
ecute the other prisoners who have 

demonstrated a stronger tendency 
toward recidivism. With over one 
percem of the nation's population in 
prison, this becomes a grotesque 
parody of justice, unthinkable by all 
but the most bloodthirsty. 

The death penalty, particularly 
its application in the United States, 
is a clear violation of internationally 
supported scandardsofhwnan rights. 
Only five countries in the world 
continue to execute minors: Bang-
ladesh, Barbados, Iran. Iraq, and the 
United States. 

Every citizen should be ashamed 
to be in the company of butchers 
like these. The American Conven-
tion on Human Rights, which has 
been signed but not rarified. forbids 
the execution of minors. 

The mentally disabled are ex-
ecuted with alanning frequency, al-
though this is prohibited in the 
United Slates. The United States 
Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that 
the Eighth Amendment prohibits 
the execution of insane prisoners. 

Unfortunately, everyone seems 
to have his or her own definition of 
insane. Many people who have the 
intellect of children (often due to 
brain damage) have been put to death 
in large part because juries frequently 
are not given evidence about a 
prisoner's psychological state, even 
if that person has been hospitalized 
for his or her impairment. 

According to the Sacramemo 
Bee, Califomia could save $90 mil-
lion per year if the death penalty 
were abolished. This prediction is 
based on the fact that it will take an 
average of $15 million to execute 
one person, at a rate of six per year. 
By contrast, it costs approximately 
$930.240 to keep an inmare impris-
oned for life, based on a 4O-year 
average life term. 

The reason for Ihe much higher 
costs is the care that California takes 
in capital crime . The jury election 
is longer and more detailed, the trial 
is longer, and in the event of a death 
sentence. the case is automatically 
appealed to the state Supreme Court. 
Jurors,judges, prosecutors, defense 
attorneys, and the nece sary sup-
port staff mu t be paid throughout 
all of this. 

Some use this as an argument to 
strictly limit appeals. Obviou Iy.this 
would increase the number of ex-
ecution al the expen e of a

defendanfs right to. fair trial. Ac-
cording to • recent Stanford Law 
Review study, in the last century, 
139 people have been condemned 
to death. only to be proven innocent 
later. Of the 139,22 were actually 
executed. Much to California's 
credit, none of those 139 were sen-
tenced in a California court. Appar-
ently, oursystCffiof appeals is effec-
tive in preventing the innocent from 
being sentenced to deaIh.. 

In 1972, the Supreme Coon 
struck down all existing death pen-
alty laws because there was over-
whelming evidence that racial bi-
ases were sending minorities in 
grossly disproportionate nwnbers 
to the execution chamber. 

Many states decided to abide by 
the Coon's decision. Most, how-
ever, amended their laws to bring 
them in line with guidelines estab-
lished by the Court. 

Since the reinstatement of the 
death penalty in 1977, more than 
2,000 pri oners have been placed 
on death row. Forty percent of these 
are black, compared with the na-
tional population of twelve percent. 
In that time, 14 percent have been 
executed for killing non-whites, 
while 86 percent havebeen executed 
for killing a white person. Women 
are gi ven death sentences much les 
frequently than men. 

The death penalty is not at all 
what its proponents claim it is. It 
does not deter crime, it i very par-
tial. and its costs to society are great. 
George Bernard Shaw said, "It is 
the deed that teaches, not the name 
we give it. Murder and capital pun-
ishment are not opposites that can-
cel one another, but simi lars that 
breed their kind." 

It i interesting that we are re-
pulsed by l~ thought of torture in 
our prisons, but we accept the cruel-
lest punishment of aiL 

Yes, Robert Alton Harris com-
mined the most horrible act our 
society knows, yet we will tum 
around and collecti vely perform the 
same act on him. Why is life impris-
onment without the possibility of 
parole not acceptable in this case? 
Or any case? 

We have seen that the death pen-
alty does not accomplish its lofty, or 
even nOI so lofty, aims. Why then, 
dowecontinue to use it? Perhaps we 
should not.

Amnesty International is so con-
cerned with Harris, but why all this 
attention, which is good, and still, 
not yet OM person from these groups 
has ever held vigils for the families 
of the victims? Harris is merely 
used to critique and advance an 
agenda. 

Myth #3: Capital punishment 
does not respect the criminal. Jus-
tice, when it punishes instead of 
getting caught in a storm of 
psychobabble, respects the crimi-
nal. It respects the criminal's choice 
and freedom because it holds him 
(and I suppose her) responsible for 
his actions. 

This is not said out of any anger 
or twisted sense of justice. Human 
beings have freedom and should be 
treated as rarional creatures, account-
able for the consequences of their 
actions. 

Obviously, punishment changes 
in the cases of the imbecile, the 
insane, or the immature. Harris ex-
hibited a coherence of thought in 
his actions. And this decision about 
a criminal's moral competence lies 
with a jury of respon ible citizens. 

Criminals should not be treated 
as "patients" declared "sick" by the 
state, or "victims of society" by the 
well-intentioned. This attitude im-
plicitly considers humans as objects 
to be treated or animals to be cured. 

Myth #4: Capital punishment 
should !l0/ be practiced because it is 
discriminatory. While it is true that 
minorities are disproportionately 
represented on death row, this is not 
an argument against justice. 

While some may hold that all 
laws are merely used by white het-
erosexual rnales to oppress people, 
justice should be practiced when a 

Monday, April 20, 1992 

person is gUilty. 
Imperfections in the law are to be 

remedied but they are not arguments 
against justice itself. Surely, because 
lots of people get away shop-lifting 
without getting caught, it is not an 
argument against punishing shop-
lifters. 

Inner-city residents who ex peri-
ence a disprop<>nionale amount of 
crime deserve equal protection un-
derthe law. If it means more arrests, 
and even capital punishment. then 
that's what needs to be done. It 
doesn't matter what the color of the 
skin is, crime must be punished; 
justice is blindfolded for a reason. 

Myth #5: Capital punishment 
does 001 deter crime. There are 
people who like to argue against 
common sense. Any criminal who 
considers a crime must consider the 
cost. If punishment is guaranteed to 
be swift and sure, this added cost 
will be taken into account. 

Our problem is that our law sys-
tem has become a lottery because of 
our focus on society's guilt instead 
of the individual responsibility of 
the criminal forhisact.lfhechooses 
evil, then justice and law must re-
spond. 

Statistics to the contrary only 
prove we have lost ourconunitment 
to law as a public stage on which to 
express how wrong it is to murder, 
rape, or otherwise violate another 
human being. 

Finally, what we have learned 
from the younger Robert Alton Har-
ris is that children need two things 
above all: love and the proper role 
models. A commitment to law and 
justice with the same vigor in the 
inner-cities, as we have in the rich-
est areas, says we are citizen con-
cemed with each other. 

The supreme respect for Ii fe and 
love of our fellow human beings is 
found in our willingness to protect 
that life with the ultimate penalty. It 
may seem antiquated, but it pro-
ceeds from a profound sense ofre-
sponsibility for our actions.

PRICE 
ContJnuecI from pa&e 1 
ports. Close to 100 percent of stu-
dents polled by CAPE recommend 
Price, and he also scores in the high 
90s in the other categories, such as 
recommendation of the course. 

Biology Professor Paul Saltman, 
in a leiter to the Alumni Associa-
tion. praised his colleague's style, 
writing that Price's lectures are "to-
tally organizedanddisciplined" and 
filled with "a sense elf humor." 

Price said that long-term feed-
back from students is especially 
gratifying for him. Last year, Price 
said he and a fonner student, who 
had been in one of Price 's classes in 
the early I 970s, recognized each 
other while visiting a ranch. The 
former student is now an anesthesi-
ologist. 

Price said he takes great satisfac-
tion in seeing his former students, 
many of whom are now doctors in 
the San Diego area. 

Consequently, he note<!, a teach-
ing award from the Alumni Asso-
ciation is especially important to 
him. 

Price said he recognizes the im-
portant role that teaching plays in 
the lives of students. An effective 
teacher can inspire a student to enter 
a field, he said, while a poor profes-
sor may deter bright students from 
it. 

The latter is the greatest danger, 
he said, considering how an ineffec-
tive lecturer may influence a 

Biology Professor Paul Price 
student's career. 

1beissueofprofessors'involve-
ment in research versus education 
has become a heated topic recently, 
especially in the scientific fields. 
Price said he feels that both are 
necessary and should complement 
each other. 

"Students need today's knowl-
edge," Price said. If a faculty mem-
berdoes research, he said, it ensures 
an up-to-date faculty , because pro-
fessors have to stay current to do 
research.

The UCSD Guardian 

According to Price, student have 
excellent opportunities to do re-
search and gain valuable experi-
ence at UCSD. He noted that an-
other benefit of a research-orien-
tated university is the high level of 
academic activity. 

Price used the availability of 
small, one-unit eminars to students 
as an example of an excellent, often 
missed opportunity for students. 
Price said he likes seminars because 
they "satisfy curiosity" without the 
pressure of grades.

VIDAL 
Continued flam PICe 1 
were, in his opinion, impinging upon 
personal rights. In an age that has 
witnessed the more prevalent cur-
railing of individual rights through 
Supreme Coun rulings, religion is 
affecting everyone through its in-
tervention in federal laws, he 
charged. 

In a press conference earlier 
Thursday. Vidal outlined his idea 
for abolishing the federal income 
tax in favor of a more controlling 
stale income tax,leaving individual 
states to provide services for their 
residents that are currently provided 
by the federal govemment. 

Continuing on a similar theme 
that evening, he discussed a decen-
tralization of power. to the point of 
leaving almost no power in Wash-
ington. D.C. 

Rather than promoting the idea 
of "from many, one," Vidal said he 
would like to see "from one, many." 

Vidal said that his present goal is 
to remove power from the hands of 
the wealthy ruling class which he 
said is "good at making itself invis-
ible." in hopes of lessening the in-
fluence of religion on national pub-

lie policy. 
Vidal concluded his lecture with 

a philosophy for the future: " . . . so 
we may establish a nation nol under 
God. bul under men ... or under our 
collective humanity_" 

During a question-and-answer 
period. Vidal fielded questions from 
the audience on a variety of lopics. 

Inansweringonequestion, Vidal 
highlighted lhe role of higher edu-
cation in the demise of American 
society. but concluded that there are 
still individuals at universities who 
are "able to keep their sanity and 
teach and learn." 

He said that such individuals are 
able to teach soundly. even though 
the universities where they work are 
owned by the wealthy, hidden rul-
ers of the nalion . 

On violence, panicularly the 
murder rale in the United States, 
Vidal said, "( would take away ev-
ery gun in private hands in the United 
States." 

Vidal also commented on his 
recent call for a constitulional con-
vention. an issue he brought up to 
the National Press Club and in an 
article for Tire Nation. His desire to 
"take another look" at the constilu-
tion is drawn from Thomas

The UCSD Guardian 

Jefferson's original plan for review 
of the U.S. Constitution as the na-
tion grew. 

"Jefferson wanted a convenlion 
every five years and maybe that's 
too often. But 200 years?" Vidal 
quipped. 

On abonion. he drew a hard line 
toward choice: "You have a right 
not to have an abonion. If you think 
it 's again t God's law ... it' your 
God. But don't teU anyone else they 

can' t have one," Vidal said. 
Vidal also spent time discussing 

the candidates for Ihis year's presi-
dential election, commenting on 
President Bush, Democratic candi-
dales Bill Clinton and Jerry Brown, 
fonner Democmtic candidale Paul 
Tsongas and Independent Candi-
date Ross Perot, saying Brown was 
the only candidate capable of hav-
ing ideas.

Baseball Hits the Skids 
• UCSD loses both ends 
of doubleheader despite 
11 hits in game two 
ay ..... ElCln 
Staff Writer 

Biola University gave the Triton 
baseball tearn two good reasons why 
it should be a polite hosI next sea-
son. 

The Eagles (15-23) upset visit-
ing UCSO 6-2 and 5-2 in both ends 
of Saturday's twin bill, avenging 
the Tritons' sweep of visiting Biola 
back in February. 

llIe shocking defeats added to 
the recent descent of UCSO 
( 19-6-1 ) as it has lost three of its last 
four contests, all defeats coming at 
the hands of suh-.500 ball clubs. 

"We were definitely there to 
play," Head Coach Lyle Yates said. 
" It was one of those doubleheaders 
where nothing went our way." 

In game one, Biola outhit the 
seldomly quiet UCSO line-up 12-3. 
The three-hit total for the Tritons 
was nearly eight beneath their sea-
son average of 10.9 hits per game. 

David Blum provided the only 
offensive fireworks with a second-
inning round-tripper accounting for 
both of the Triton runs. 10e senior 
third baseman picked up two of the 
team's three hits. 

Junior Ryan Flanagan (6-1) 
lasted only lhree-and-two-thirds in-
nings, while conceding all six of the 
Eagle runs on eight hits. 1Oesouth-
paw has been hit hard in three of his 
last four outings_ YateS believes back 
pain is responsible for slowing the 
usually strong perfonnances of his 
lefty ace. 

Denny Kubinski closed out the 
fourth inning for Flanagan and 
hurled two more innings of shut-out 
ball for the Tritons. 

In game two the Triton c1ubbers 
came alive to muster II base hits, 
while scoring only twice.

CItucI<~~ 
David Blum had two hits at Biola. 

"We were hitting the ball hard, 
but always right at somebody," Yates 
said. "We easily could /lave had a 
half-dozen more hits." 

Outfielders Steve Wrenn and 
Ernie Isola exploded for three hits 
apiece to lead UCSD, while lead-
off hitter Guy Cataldo roped two 
hils in five at-bats. 

Bryan Thomason (4-2) tossed 
seven solid innings of work, strik-
ing out five while walking only IWO. 
The senior righthander yielded five 
runs, only three earned, but still 
received the loss for his respectable 
outing. 

Despite the recenl slide, Yates 
feels the team's chances of post-
season play are excellent. With two 
playoff spots available from their 
region, Cal Lutheran is the only 
other team which can compete with 
UCSO's record. 

"We need to fini sh strong in April 
to gain some momentum," Yates 
said. The team which raced out to 
an 11-0-1 record through Mar. 10, 
has since gone a mediocre 8-6. 
UCSD will g~ay a spJjt-sq~ad 
doubleheader on Tuesday agamst 
Occidental and Cal Tech. Though 
the Tritons will only boast partial 
rosters against the full squads of 
their opponents, both games will 
count toward their record.

the fourth, and Kim Stutzman came 
in to start the fifth. In the sixth, USD 
got its only hit off of the junior, but 
it was a big one - a double with 
runners on first and second. 1l1e 
score Wa! 4-2, and that' the way it 
ended. 

The second game found the Tri-
tons matched up against the Comets 
from St Paul, Minnesota Concordia 
drew first blood with a run in the 
bottom of the first on a single and a 
double. 

The Tritons didn't wait long to 
reply. In the bottom of the second, 
helped by several bonehead play 
on Concordia's part, UCSD brought 
home seven runs on six hits. 

The Concordia defense stiffened 
after that, allowing only one runner 
to get to scoring position after the 
second. UCSD, on the other hand, 
went to sleep. TIle Comets scored 
three quick runs off of Triton starter 
Lacie Mounger in the third, and it 
was suddenly a close game. 
Stutzman was brought in in the 
fourth to keep it from gelling any 
closer. but she was scored upon

once in the fourth. It could have 
been worse, though, without Faith 
Franke's unassisted double play to 
close out the inning. 

Stutzman gave up two singles to 
the first two batters he faced in the 
fifth. but sat down the last three in a 
row to end the game with a 7-5 
UCSD victory. 

Mental letdowns have been a 
problem that has plagued the Tri-
tons and Head Coach Melissa Jarrell 
all season. "We just get lackadaisi-
cal out there when we get the lead. I 
thought we had the game, but we got 
nat and it always happen . I don't 
know what to do about it," Jarrell 
said. 

1l1e Tritons had no chance to let 
down in their last game of the pre-
liminary round against Cal State 
Hayward. TIle Pioneers, the sev-
enth-ranked team in Division D, took 
control of the game early and never 
10 t their grip. scoring two in the top 
of the first and four in the fifth on 
their way to a 7-1 Whipping. 

UCSD' offense, frustrated all 
day by Hayward pitcher Amy Circo. 
picked up only two hit • both in the 
third. Lisa Mora singled and then 
Zuniga brought her home with a 
double for the Tritons' only score of 
the game. 

TIle bad news was not limited to 
the score, however, as the Tritons 
lost starting second baseman Lisa 
Gil to a possible strained knee liga-
ment. Gil did not return for the rest 
of the tournament.

hitting the Comets' leadoff batter. 
Concordia gOltwo hits and one run 
to take the lead after the first. 

UCSD never got anything go-
ing, with Melissa Mazanet's score 
in the third counting as the Triton's 
only run. It was an especially mea-
ger performance considering 
Concordia once again gave UCSD 
plenty of chances by committing six 
errors. 

The Comets, on the other hand, 
took full advantage of their own 
opportunities by touching Moreno 
for eight hits on their way to the 4-1 
win. 

''I'm not sure what to do. Some-

UCSD Track Rewrites the 
Record Books at Pomona 
• Five school marks fall 
at Pomona-Pitzer, Tritons 
now boast 17 NCAA 
Championship qualifiers 
By Gregg Wrenn 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD track team continues 
to impress as it heads into the 
season' s home stretch. 

Competing in the Pomona-Pitzer 
Invitational on Friday, the Tritons 
smashed five more school records. 
with four of those new records be-
ing good enough to qualify for the 
NCAA championships. 

800-meter race. 
Washington put in two other 

impressive efforts, with a couple of 
second-place finishes in the I 00 and 
200 meters. 

Sprowl 's triple jump of 36 feet 
was good enough for another sec-
ond-place Triton finish. 

' 'I'm really happy with our per-
formance," UCSD Head Coach 
Mark Stanforth said. "This is the 
time of the year we should be run-
ning fast , and we're doing it." 

Down four matches to two after 
the singles competition, the Tritons 
had to win all three of the doubles 
matches to claim the victory. TIle 
team of Cross and Bethard started 
things off for UCSD as they de-
feated the Bulldogs' tearn of Wil-
liams and Mell in three exciting 
set ,6-4. 2-6, 64. 

Sue MapeslGu~ 
John Cross was unable to defeat his Bulldog opponent, losing &4, 6-3. 

Erica Washington, Yvette 
Manullo, Renee Sprowl and Mich-
elle Milledge won the women's 
4x 100 relay with a record-breaking 
time of 48.31 second . 

The Tritons now have 10 men 
and seven women qualified for the 
NCAA . Several of those qualify-
ing times are provisional right now: 
nevertheless,UCSDwilltakeamini-
mum of eight men and five women 
to the championships. 

The number-three team of 
Hedrick and Gessford ousted the 
team of Bulldogs' Mullet and Sean 
Comrnondero in two hard-fought 
sets, 6-4, 6-4.

Tennis Dogged

• Tritons lose top four 
single matches, lose a 
close contest to Bulldog 
By Blair Rlcley Goose, Dullards 

And Dunderheads 
J UST A FEW NOTES: • USA Today blew it with the Arthur Ashe story. 
America's favorite comic book, 
apparently in some kind of a 
delayed rush to how that there is, 
in fact. new within its page . . 
pcrfom1ed the equivaJcl1I of 
journalistic blackmail by foreing 
Ashe into revealing that he has 
AIDS. 

I f there is even the slightest 
notion of a right to privacy in our 
~ociety, USA Today's threat to go 
public with the story violated it, 
pure and simple. The only p<-"'Ople 
who have a "right to know" are 
those people who will be directly 
affected by his condition. Pre~um­
ably. his wife and doctor knew. 
Ashe' condition affects no ne 
else. and that immediately 
eliminates it from being cl aked 
in the vague dressing of "new:.." 

The excu e that he is a 
celebri ty, and as a result, hi s life is 
open to public scrutiny, is 
irrelevant. This is not a case of 
drug or crime in which his 
behavior goes directly to his moral 
chamcter. This is not a case where 
the public has a right to know 
about what it 's paying for. 

A RTI~UR kili E tS still a f~lly ­functioning human bcll1g.

him except cause a great deal of 
heartache and make him an 
unwitting target of an overzealous

Bring Your Own Banana 
UCSD campus groups respond to the need for AIDS 

education and awareness 
BY JUSTIN KATZ . CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

1bere was a time when "Bring 
Your Own Banana" meant ice 
cream sundaes for everyone. Now 
it's a lesson on how to properly 
use a condom. 1lIere was a time 
when AIDS only affected 
"someone else." Now it is a 
known fact that everyone is 
vulnerable to the disease. With the 
AIDS epidemic upon us. there is a 
definite need for education, 
awareness. and protection from 
the deadly virus. 

Here at UCSD, there has been 
an active and effective response to 
this crisis through a number of 
different groups and individuals. . 
1be effons of groups like Active 
Students For AIDS Prevention 
(ASAP), the AIDS Teamsters and 
the AIDS Education and Preven-
tion Taskforce have brought the 
crisis to light and have energized 
tudents 10 protect both them-

selves and each other. 
Much ofthis effort was 

initiated back in 1987 when 
Christine Oakley. direclor of 
Student Health Education and 
coordinator of Women's Health 
Care Services. began to put 
together the AIDS Education And 
Prevention Taskforce. 

"1bere was no organized 
response to AIDS," Oakley said. 
"We were seeing students wilh the 
HIV virus, and we realized that a 
program needed to be pul in 
action. People needed 10 know 
what was going on." 

The AIDS Education and 
Prevention Taskforce has now 
become the largest promoter of 
AIDS infonnation and resources 
on campus. II presently has a large 
staff of both professionals and 
sludents working to help prevent 
the further spread of AIDS in the 
student community. 

The Taskforce has brought 
many different programs and 
guest speakers to this campus, 
including a ponion of the AIDS 
Quilt for display in the Price 
Center. 

"It just touched people in a 
way that only a quilt of that size 
could," Oakley explained. She 
received many calls from fratemi-
ties, sororitie , and other student 
associations that wanted to help 
with AIDS progr.uns after having 
seen the quilt. 

Another sight often seen 
around campus is the Taskforce's 
"Condom Maps." Complete with 
a smiling cartoon condom, they

inform students of where they can 
purchase condoms: from !he coin-
op vendors in virtually all ofthc 
major restrooms to !he pharmacy 
counter in the Student Health 
Building (only $2 . .50 a dozen!). 

The AIDS Education and 
Prevention Taskforce also 
promotes staff education and 
development programs about 
AIDS awareness. The Taskforce 
will go 10 any length to create. 
"tailor-made" programs for the 
staff groups. 

"Say one person has AIDS or 
is infected with HIV and wants to 
go back into their woilc unit We 
want people to understand that it's 
okay, that it's safe, and that these 
people need to be accepted," 
Oakley explained. She also noted 
there has been a sizeable response 
in staff requests for AIDS 
education programs. 

PIU.....,/~ 

Director of Student Health 
Education Christine Oakley 

The path to the current 
standards of AIDS education and 
prevention hasn't always been as 
smooth. 

"People were tending to get 
kind of AlDSed-out, .. sIle 
continued "They get the attitude 
of 'Yeah, yeah I hear you. I know 
how people get AIDS. Now get 
out of my face.' When that 
happened we moved our focus 
towards peer education. We 
needed to make the education 
programs more personal to the 
students. We wanted to provide a 
more comprehensive way to deal 
with HN and AIDS, That's where 
the AIDS Teamsters carne ill-" 

The AIDS Teamsters are 
perhaps the most active group 
promoting this kind of education 
campus-wide. 1bey are HIV peer 
educators. Their message, 
according to Oakley, is "I'm a 
student and I'm concerned about

HIV and AIDS, Here's what I 
want you to know." 

1be Teamslers program now 
consists of about ten or eleven 
members., most of which are 
junior or seniors., although 
Teamsters indicated they will 
soon be recruiting new members. 

"We do programs in the 
classroom and around campus," 
Teamster GaJit Feinreich ex-
plained "We also tJy to do 
presentations for sororities and 
other student groups, and we're 
hoping to reach fraternities by the 
end of this year. 

"Fall Quaner we did eight 
programs and reached 160 
students. Winter Quarter we did 
twelve programs and reacl]ed 
324 ... . Many students returned 
our questionnaires after we did 
presentations. Those are going to 
be low figures anyway, because 
not everyone takes the time to tum 
in a response sheet," Feinreich 
said. 

At one such program last 
quarter in the Warren Commons, 
all students present ti lied out pre-
program questionnaires. 1be 
anonymous questions dealt with 
AIDS awareness and knowledge, 
including issues of personal safety 
and sexual practices. 

Then students watched a video 
dealing with individual students 
with AIDS, a video that made the 
problem very personal and real. 

"All we do after the video is 
talk," Feinreich said. "It's not a 
question and answer session. It's 
not one person leading." 

After the discussion, the 
Teamsters led a condom demon-
stration (on a banana, of course) 
and several role-playing games. 
Free condoms complete with 
infonnarion and instructions were 
given out, and a follow-up 
questionnaire was turned in. 

When asked if they thought 
the message was geuing through, 
TeamsterSteve Simmons 
explained, "There are still many 
students in denial of HIV and 
AIDS. But more people are 
coming in open minded and have 
less of an attitude. We're in a 
transition period between people 
realizing they are at risk and 
actually doing something about 
it." 

"We've done follow-up and 
we've found that freshman know 
more and more each year about

DAV ID Hl1fOlES FIRST MET LARRY McGLYNN over two years ago when bolh were gradu-ate student at UCSD. After they had been seeing one another for several month ,they 
decided to pursue a long-Ienn, committed relation-
hip. In April of 1990, they began to live together in 

Larry's apartment at UCSD's Coast Apartment .At 
the time, David was still the primary tenant on WlOther 
housing lease at the Mesa complex, where he had been 
haring the apartment with a different roommate. 

When he left to study abroad at the beginning of Fall 
Quarter 1990, David and Larry moved into David ' 
original apartment. 

Larry has ince taken a leave of absence from his 
graduate studies to pursue a career in medicine, while 
Hutches continue to work for his Ph.D. in computer 
science. They still live together in university housing, 
which, according to an unpopular UC system policy, 
means that David and Larry are living together illegal-
ly. 

David Hutches and Larry McGlynn consti tute what 
is known as a domestic pannership - a long-tenn, 
committed relationship between unmarried same-sex 
oropposite-sex partners. Whi Ie the UC system extends 
benefits. including a cess to university housing to the 
spouses and children of married faculty, staff and 
tudenLS, it doe not re gnize domestic panners as 

legitimate families. 
"(n the summer of 1990, we went to the housing 

offi es in order 10 see if there w any way that we 
could live together legally. We were basically told 'no 
way,' " Hutches recalled. 

U SD' hou ' ing policy allows married couples to 
live in campus housing, even ifone of the partners is a 
non-student. In domestic partnen.hipl> like the one 
between David and Larry. however, where one panner 
is a non-student, the university will not permit the 
couple to live in UC housing. 

According to Mark Cunningham, the Director of 
Housing Facilities at UCSD, the only way for a n n-
student to live in university housing is to be legally 
married to a registered student. In recent years, ~e er.J1 
l>lUdent organization have charged that the policy 
violates the university'), anti-discrimination clau e by 
denying eq ual acce~l> to housing on the basi of sexual 
orientation and marital s tatus. 

"As it currently stands, the system is discriminato-
ry, and as ( see it, there are only two choice when it 
comes to de termining what might be belot for gr.ld uate 
l>tudents," said Brian Ladner, the vice-pres ident exter-
nal for the Gmduate Student A~sociation (GSA). As a 
member of the Board of Directors of the UC Student 
A!>sociation (UCSA), Ladner has been working for the 
recognition of domeMic partnen.hips formarried/fam-
ily lotudent h using benefits sy~temwide. 

"Either you only allow ~tudents to live there when 
it comes to married or dome!>tic partnership issues or 
you allow both nOIHtudent spou~es and non-student 
domestic panners," Ladner said. 

Each UC campus determines hous ing policy aI its 
own discretion, Ladner explained. At most campuses. 
grJdulte student housing is divided into single ~tu­
dents and married/family student housing. Some am-
puses, such as UC Riverside, give priority to single or 
married students with children. 

Cunningham describes UCSD's policy as unique, 
in that the system is "more like an apartment complex" 
with both married and single gmduates living at Coa.st 
and Mesa. To qualify forhousing,astudentneeds to be 

registered and carrying a full load of classes. 
UCSD has approximately 800 apartment avail-

able at the complexe . which translates to I ,600 bed . 
There is a year-and-a-half to two-year waiting li t for 
this low-cost hou ing, As ignmems for rooms are 
made by taking primary tenants from the waiting list. 
Secondary tenant are chosen by the primary tenant 
and are also put on the apartment lease. If both tenant 
are student , there are no restrictions which prohibit 
men and women from living together, a policy which 
differs from other campuses like UCLA. 

"Basically, San Diegoi really good in that if you're 
both tudents, they don't give a shit," said Olristine 
Halverson, last year's GSA housing committee co-
chair. " However, if one (of the partnersJ is not a 
tudent,that' s where the problem arise ." 

Gmduatehou ingalthecomplexe i muchcheap-
er than hou ing in the surrounding area. Ladner esti-
mate that hi monthly rent is approximately $200 
more than it would be at Coast or Mesa. 

The university 's La Jolla del Sol complex does 
allow exceptions to the University' domestic partner-
ship policy. At La Jolla del Sol, only the primary 
resident need to be affiliated with the universiry. 
Domestic partnerships are allowed, in thi sense, if the 
complex is not filled 10 capacity, However, the higher 
rent at La Jolla del Sol consequently prohibits most 
gmduate ~tudents from living there. 

Cunningham ~aid that he is currently reviewing the 
existing hous ing policy. But dom tic partnerships 
will not be among the issue that he will be looking at. 

.... ve been with Mesa for 12 years, and I've had one 
formal request to addres the issue. That was probably 
atle;\.')t four years ago:' Cunningham !;3id. "Now, doe -
that mean it isn 'taconcem? Probably nol. It just means 
people probably say, ' I don't have the option , I'm not 
even going to ask.' " 

" If I was involved in any domestic partnership 
si tUalion and my ~ignificant other and I wanted to 
m ve into housing. the last person on earth I would go 

a~k would be the housing office becau e if they say no, 
then I'm stuck. Then, they know who ( am," Ladner 
~aid. 

Despite the complaints about the university's c ur-
rent policy, Cunningham feel that it adequately serves 
the needs of gmduate tudents without violating the 
non-discrimination clau e of the university. 

" I think that if you look at the issue of marital status 
in our progrJm, we have to look toward some kind of 
con~ i stent policy. and I think that by using what we 
have now, which is a recognized tandard. it allows us 
to be consistent and not get into issues of being 
discriminatory." Cunningham said. 

A growing number of people within the UC ystem. 
however, are beginning to challenge the university's 
policy. claiming that it no longer reflects the need of 
students, faculty and staff. 

At UCS D, the GSA has passed several resolutions 
calling for the recognition of domestic pannerships. 
The first resolution , passed in June 1991, demanded 
that university housing benefits beextended todome ' -
tic partnerships. A new resolution, proposed by lad-
ner, was passed unanimou Iy by the GSA in March. It 
calls on administrators and hous ing officials at UCSD 
to implement campus-wide housing guideline which 
include the recognition of domestic partnerships. The 
rc olution also calls for the same guidelines to be 
adopted by the regen ts and the other UC campuses. 

The resolution does not contain any definition of

A university policy that allows spouses to live in university housing 
is leaving students in domestic partnerships out in the cold 

BY PHiliP MICHAELS, SE NI OR STAFF WRITER 

domestic partnership, because such guidelines have 
clouded the issue in the past, according to Ladner. 

"I didn't propose aset of guidelines fordetennining 
what would constitute a domestic partnership for a 
reason. Every time we do, ladministmtorsj shoot it 
down. I want to see the administration put forward the 
guidelines, guidelines we can all live with," he said. 

Earlier this month, Ladner presented the resolution 
to a subcommittee of the UCSA. which discussed 
possible changes to make the resolution applicable to 
the entire UC system. The resolution will be brought 
up for endorsement at the UCSA's May meeting. 

A petition is also circulating around UCSD which 
urges the university 10 refonn it policies and proce-
dures by recognizing domes tic partnerships. The peti-
tion defines domestic partnerships as "any two persons 
over 18 years of age Who,sllbmit an affidavit stating 
that the partners have fonned a domestic union. " The 
petition was started by the Le bian Gay Bisexual 
FaCUlty and Staff Association (LGBFSA) at UCSD. 

According to the LGBFSA's Ben Freeman, the 
petition has received a positive re ponse. It will be 
presented to UC administrators after funher strategies 
are developed. 

" We want them to have options that we've worked 

out for them," said Freeman. "We would like [admin-
istrators) to be aware that Ihe ~ ituation is out there, 
especially in light of [he non-di,climination policy." 

By failing to recognize dome ·tic partnerships, crit-
ics charge, the UC system i~ out of touch with the 
times. A recent report by the Families and Work 
Institute. a non-profit research center in New York. 
claimed that only 25 percent of American families tit 
the "traditional" model of a fam ily, with a male bread-
winner, a female homemaker and children. 

"There is such a tiny fraction of people in this state 
that fit the nuclear family model. [Recognition of 
domestic partnerships) is just something that makes 
sense," said Laurie Klein, a Santa Cruz-based attomey 
who is currently involved in a domestic partnership 
case. 

The extension of benefits to domestic partners is 
occurring with greater frequency in cities, private 
businesses, and universities. San Francisco has estab-
lished a progmm where domestic partners can register 
with the city. Los Angeles and Berke ley, among other 
cities, have adopted anti-discrimination laws which 
prohibit denying housing to same-sex or opposite sex 
domestic partners. However, these ordinances do not 
apply to UC campuses becau 'e a state code allows

universities to set aside family student housing prima-
rily for married students or students with dependents. 

Private companies such as Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream. 
Levi Strauss and Lotus Development have joined 
California cities like Santa Cruz and West Hollywood 
in extending coverage to the domestic partners of their 
employees. 

Recently, UC San Francisco decided to allow the 
domestic partners of stodents to use the Millbery 
Union Fitness Center, if the domestic pannership is 
registered with the city. This decision does not affect 
UCSD, as the city of San Diego does not recognize 
domestic partnerships. 

Princeton, Ohio State, Carnegie Mellon, and New 
York University all have policies which extend bene-
fits to domestic pannerships, including the use of 
libraries and university facilities . Stanford University 
has established a progr.Jlll which extends housing 
benefits to both same-sex and opposite-sex domestic 
partnerships. Stanford's policy. instituted in the fall of 
1990, provides acces to hou ing for both married 
couples and those in a long-tenn relationship "with a 
commitment similar to that of marriage." 

Unlike other universities, Stanford does not require 
proof that the partnership is valid, such as a waiting

period or indication of financial interdependence. 
Michael Alva, a spokesman from the Office of UC 

President David Gardner, argued that the Stanford 
policy does not set u precedent for the UC system. 

"My understanding is that for the purposes of 
hous ing, Stanford is a private institution," he said, 

But other public universities have also begun to 
recognize domestic partnerships, The University of 
Wisconsin at Madison allows both married and non-
married couples to live in housing, and the University 
of Oregon permits domest ic partnershi ps when a same-
sex or opposite-sex couple also has children. 

Officials from Gardner's office say that domestic 
partnership is an issue that should be addressed on the 
state level. But Susan Polan, last year's UCSA Presi-
dent, pointed out that pUlling the issue of dome tie 
partnerships in the hands of the ~tate legislature is an 
unusual position for the UC to take. 

" In other situations. [GardnerJ is very quick to say 
that we're a consti tutionally autonomous in. titution," 
Polan said. 

111erehas been some peculation that the unive rs ity 
has been especially cautious when dealing with do-
mestic partnership issues because it fears fallout from 
the legislature. 

" I think the issue here is [hat the UC face the wrath 
of the state legislature when the budget is already in 
crisis," said Aaron Walden, a member of the UCSA 
board of directors. 

John Refling, a graduate student at UC (rvine, has 
talked to university administrators about who has the 
power to change the domestic partnership policy. 

"First of all, ( believe [hat the UC can change its 
policy," he said. "They don't want to at the moment, 
simply because of public opinion." 

"Argument~ that evidence a fear of public reaction 
seem particularly outofplaceatan institution which is 
supposed to promote leaming and enlightenment, and 
are just as inappropriate now as when, once upon a 
time . they would have been used to prevent the hiring 
oradmission of women or African-Americ<ms," Hutch-
es said. 

A precedent may have been established with a 
report from the Joint Ta.<;k Force on the Changing 
Family, a commillee composed of membefl> of the 
State As embly and Senate. The Task Force conclud-
ed that the definition of a family, a.~ a unit which 
provides emotional and economic suppon, includes 
non-tmditional families such as domestic partner-
ships. Discrimination against domestic partners, the 
Task Force declared, was damaging to the stability of 
the relationship. 

There have been challenges to the current UC 
policy at other UC campuses. At UC Santa Cruz, a 
same-sex couple was denied admiuance to the Univer-
sity' s Family Student Housing. They contacted Klein. 
who, with the National Center for Lesbian Right s in 
San Fmncisco, hopes to put political pressure on the 
regents to alter their policy. 

UC Irvine has been the site of a prolonged bailie 
over domestic partnership, which began in early 1989 
when two same-sex couples applied to the Verano 
Place housing complex. They were accepted under an 
obscure procedure which allowed non-married cou-
ples to live together ifbeing kept apart would create a 
hardship that jeopardized enrollment at Irvine. 

"The Chancellor received pressure because people 
were referring to it as a precedent. When he began 10 
receive pressure, he stepped in:' said Polan, who is a

graduate student at Irvine, 
Irvine Chancellor and incoming UC President Jad. 

Peltason overruled the housing authority. saying that 
the policy did not apply to gay or lesbian couples, and 
that the couples had been admiued in error. TIle excep-
tions policy remains inta t for heterosexual couples. 

"There were rumors that if this got out, that people 
would stop donating money to the university. That'~ 
what they told us. They talked about a lot of ex temal 
pressure," Refling said. 

In the spring of 1990, a cardboard box "shantytown" 
was erected in front of the administrative building at 
Irvine to protest the policy. The protest culminated in 
the arrest of six students for blocking the entrJnceto the 
building. 

The Irvine s ituation illustrated one of the major 
obstacles in changing the unive~ity's policy, namely 
that UC administmtors don't seem to know who would 
be responsible for making a policy change. 

"That would h;\Ve to come, to my knowledge, from 
the regents," said Jana Black. the director of resident ial 
apanments at UCSD. 

Alva. however, rejected Black's ~uggestion. 
"The fee ling is that this is a state policy mailer and 

that the university follows the State's lead in mmters of 
public law," he said. 

According to Ladner, the regents invoke stute law 
when it is convenienl. He sugge~t~ that the ability to 
alter policy is left to the individual chancellors. 

" But no one chancellor wants to takc the respon~i­
bility for allowing this to happen. N body has set out a 
policy, and everybody'~ afraid to." Ladner said. 

At a UCSA summit in February, a discussion group 
headed by Ladner and Walden recommended that tht.: 
UCSA push for the UC sy~ [em to adopt o lle housing 
policy to be accepted by all the campuses. There would 
be no mention of domestic partnership in the policy. 

"Then, we would know who to pressure for change. 
We would only have to go after one document mther 
than attacking a nine-headed beast," said Ladner. 

While many are hopeful that the University of 
California will jo in private businesses and other un i-
versities in recognizing domestic partnerships, Walden 
cautioned that this may 1I0t happen any time ~oon. 

"Whnt we 're looking at is a protl'Uctt.:d, nasty battlc. 
This is something that wi ll not be changed for quite a 
while," Walden sa id . 

David Hutches and Larry McGlynn have a battle of 
their own to contend with. On April 13, Hutches' 
forme r roommate wa~ evicted fro111 university hous-
ing. Hutches has thirty days to tind a secondary for the 
apartment, orhe and McGlynn will be forced to vacate. 

Hutches and McGlynn have contacted Black about 
the case. While Hutchesdesc ribed Black as sympathet-
ic, he was told there was not much chance of the pol icy 
being c hanged. 

While the case is currently being reviewed by the 
ACLU, neither Hutches nor McGlynn relish the thought 
of a protrJcted legal bailie with the UC system. 

" (t would be nice if the university were to ex:ulline 
its policies willingly and discover that they should be 
changed in order to be fairer and more reali ·tic given 
the nature of family today," said Hutches. "Larry and 
I cannot si ngle-handedly attempt to re-educate the 
adm inistmtion of the UC, but we can hope to accom-
plish something small which one day might bea part of 
the same en lightenment that places like Lotus Devel-
opment, Stanford, Ohio State, Camegie-Mellon, and 
Princeton have already experienced."

At what age do you think 

children should be educated 
about AIDS and safe sex 
issues, and how much do 

they need to know? 
Photographer: Sean Dreilinger 
----------. 

AIDS education and safe sex 
issues should be incorporated as 
a major part of sex education 
curriculum in middle school. 
Early awareness is the key 
because knowing is half the 
battle (G.!, Joe).

Sexual 
education 
should be a 
part ofa 
child's life 
from the 
day they arc 
born. Issues 
about AIDS 

and safc sex should be intro-
duced around the age of 12 
when kids are in a very transi-
tional stage going through 
junior high and entering their 
teenage years. 

Brooke Shambora, Muir 
Freslunan, Undeclared 

Children 
should be 
educated 
about sex 
and AIDS 
when they 
first ask. 
Most 
children ask 

in their early grade school years 
and should be told as much as 
possible in terms they under-
stand. 

Kciko Hanunond, Muir 
Junior, Biology 

Children 
begin to 
learn about 
sex from 
their fiiends 
and parents, 
as well as 
from other 
influences in 
the 3rd, 4th, 5th grades. This 
would therefOre be an ideal time 
to begin educating them about 
the risks of sex. They don't 
need to know the explicit details 
yet, but basic information would 
be good.

Junior, Bioengineering
