NO SANCTIONS 
FOR ALL-
CAMPUS 
EMAIL

Judicial Board dismisses grievances over 
alleged misinformation, improper 

campaigning in D-I election.
By angela chen • Editor in Chief

THURSDAY, MARCH 8, 2012 WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORGVOLUME 45, ISSUE 38

IS HE OR ISN’T HE?
FIND OUT IN  

MONDAY’S ISSUE.

The all-campus pro-referendum email sent by for-mer A.S. President Utsav Gupta does not violate election guidelines, the Judicial Board ruled 4-0-2 on March 7. Although the Elections Committee 
unanimously agreed that misinformation presented in the 
email broke election bylaws — and thus forwarded the 
grievance for an official hearing before J-Board — the board 
dismissed the grievance on the grounds that there was no 
intent to mislead. 

A.S. Advocate General Courtney Hill, who chairs the 
Elections Committee, represented con campaign leader 
Kevin Quirolo in the hearing. Speaking on behalf of Quirolo 
(who filed the grievance),  she stated that claims in Gupta’s 
Feb. 29 email were false. Gupta wrote that the move to D-I 
would lead to higher U.S. News & World Report rankings, 
which Hill said was not necessarily true, as News & World 
does not use sports funding as criteria for ranking. In addi-
tion, the email said that students on financial aid would not 
be affected by the $495 annual student fee increase, since 
29 percent of the increase returns to scholarship. Hill said 
that a portion of financial aid consists of loans, which stu-
dents will need to pay back. Hill clarified that the grievance 
did not address the method Gupta used to send the email; 
Gupta has stated that he did not use any official resources 
or access a campuswide listserv improperly, as was earlier 
alleged. 

Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs Mac Zilber 
represented Gupta, who is currently in Walnut Creek, Calif. 
Zilber first addressed procedural problems with the hearing 
that violated sections of the Election Code — for example, 
Gupta had not been notified of the grievance in a timely 
manner. In regard to the charges, Zilber stated that Section 
7.2.3 of the Elections Code allowed for sanctions against 
providing misleading information only if the information 
was “intentionally and provably false.”

He cited Gupta’s arguments in defense of his email, spe-
cifically that although News & World does not use sports 
funding as a criteria, there is a definite correlation between 
D-I athletics and the rankings. In addition, Gupta had 
interpreted “on financial aid” loosely, as the term could be 
used to indicate students who have a full ride to UCSD and 
may not be required to pay back additional loans. Gupta 
obviously believed in the validity of his arguments and his 
arguments were not intentionally false, Zilber argued. 

The Judicial Board ruled in favor of Gupta by dismissing

Police Block 
Release of 
Davis Pepper 
Spray Report
BY ZEV HURWITZ
Associate News Editor

A California judge temporarily 
blocked the planned March 6 release 
of a report about last year’s UC Davis 
pepper spray incident. The Federated 

University Police 
Officers Association 
filed a restrain-
ing order March 5 
against the report, 
claiming that it 
named and incrimi-

nated several police officers who were 
involved in the incident.

California Superior Court Judge 
Evelio Grillo ruled that the findings 
must be postponed in conjunction 
with California Penal Code sections 
832.7 and 827.8, which bar release

the grievance in the interest of having 
a “free and fair election,” according to 
the official statement. 

Quirolo said that the wording of 
the election code represented a policy 
failure.

“The policy is written in such a 
way that it’s almost impossible to find 
someone guilty of offense, except in 
the most extreme examples,” Quirolo 
said. “Another issue is that this result 
failed to give special weight to the fact 
that [Gupta’s] not a student and he’s 
trying to influence the election.”

But Zilber argued that the policy 
deliberately created a high standard 
for grievances related to misinforma-
tion. 

“It is not for A.S. to police free 
speech or campaigning,” Zilber said. 
“We deliberately set a very high stan-
dard of evidence in these cases so 
that people could only be sanctioned 
if they said something blatantly false, 

such as that the referendum would 
cost $0 or $1000.”

The second grievance of the 
night, filed March 7 by Engineering 
Senator Parminder Sandhu, alleged 
that members of the con campaign 
violated election guidelines by cam-
paigning in classrooms. The evidence 
provided included photos of an indi-
vidual writing anti-referendum mes-
sages on classroom boards. 

Quirolo said that the con cam-
paign leaders had explicitly told other 
members not to campaign in this way.

“It would be extremely difficult 
to pin down the con campaign as 
specifically responsible for a lot of 
the chalking,” he said. “I, person-
ally, told people to stop chalking the 
classrooms, but apparently that didn’t 
happen. I stopped as soon as people 
told me it was an offense, told other 
people, and so it would be inappro-
priate to hold responsible representa-
tives of the official campaign.  We did 
the responsible thing.”

The Judicial Board eventually 
voted 5-0-1 to dismiss the grievances 
on the grounds that the photographic 
evidence had no timestamp confirm-
ing its veracity. In addition, the offi-
cial statement said that there was 
evidence that, on or prior to Feb. 
29, both sides of the campaign had 
already communicated regarding the 
issue, which was evidence that should 
have been submitted.

Hill said that, despite both griev-
ances being dismissed, the new meth-
od of having the Elections Committee 
represent a grievance — and not the 
parties themselves — was a success 
because it preserved neutrality and 
reduced stress. 

Students can vote in the special 
election on TritonLink until Friday, 
March 9 at 4 p.m. The results will 
be announced March 9 at 6 p.m. at 
Round Table Pizza.

of confidential police personnel 
records.

UC President Mark G. Yudof 
appointed a task force on Dec. 15 in 
the aftermath of the Nov. 18 pepper 
spray incident. The task force, led by 
former California Supreme Court 
Justice Cruz Reynoso, compiled the 
report, which was scheduled for 
release on Tuesday. 

The officers’ union that request-
ed the postponement hopes to cen-
sor the names of involved police 
personnel and replace them with 
pseudonyms. According to the San 

Francisco Chronicle, several officers, 
namely Lt. John Pike —  the officer 
caught on film spraying the protest-
ers —  were probably referred to 
by name in the report. The union 
believes that the inclusion of officer 
names and actions is a violation 
of the state law, which protects the 
confidentiality of on-duty officers’ 
privacy.

The unreleased task force report 
provides an analysis of police action 
during the Occupy UC Davis dem-
onstration, in which police doused 
over a dozen protesters with pepper 
spray. The report will also include 
recommendations for action in this 

and future cases.
As recently as March 3, the UCD 

website noted that the report would 
be available for download by the 
general public on March 6. 

A statement released March 5 
by the UC Office of the President 
said that the UC General Counsel’s 
office tried to block the ban, but was 
ultimately unsuccessful.

“The entire UC Davis commu-
nity deserves a fully transparent 
and unexpurgated accounting of the 
incidents in question,” Yudof wrote. 
“Though I have not seen the reports, 
I am told the task force and its sup-
porting investigators have provided 

just such an accounting.”
A separate UCOP statement 

made Tuesday by General Counsel 
Charles Robinson said that the UC 
System would continue to pursue 
the immediate release of the report.

“We look forward to the next 
round, and we will fight vigorously 
in court to ensure that the task force 
report sees public light as soon as 
possible,” Robinson said.

A hearing regarding the report’s 
release to the public is scheduled for 
March 16.

After voting down Students for Justice in Palestine’s divestment resolution last 
week, A.S. Council faced harsh 
complaints and 
criticism from 
members of the 
public. 
     “Yes, this 
[resolution] is 
about the Israeli-
Palestinian 
conflict, but it’s 
also about neutrality,” SJP member 
Samera Yousef said. “All thoughout 
the year, we are divided. It’s similar 
to asking College Democrats and 
College Republicans to come 
together and make a resolution that 
both sides can agree on.” 
     Revelle College Council also 
addressed the councilmembers, 
continuing the college council 
visits that started during Week 
Seven. They offered a poster of 
a hand-drawn Sun God to A.S. 
council. Their school spirit was 
well appreciated after a politically 
charged week. 
     Vice President of Student Life 
Meredith Madnick announced that 
this quarter’s Pancake Breakfast will 
be sponsored by the Interfraternity 
Council, Panhellenic Conference 
and the Student Foundation. The 
money from these sponsors will 
fund new food options for the 
event.    
      Everyone is anxiously awaiting 
the announcement of the new 
option (either fruit or meat), 
which will be revealed at next 
Wednesday’s meeting.
      President Alyssa Wing 
announced that she will not be 
present for next week’s council, 
as she must attend a chancellor 
selection meeting. 

      She took the opportunity to 
address council with thoughts she 
would have saved for next week’s 
meeting, which will be the last 

meeting of 
Winter Quarter.
“I really just 
want to thank 
you all for your 
commitment 
through 
everything,” 
she said. “I 

really am proud to call you my 
councilmembers and my friends as 
well.”  
      Council was very touched 
by Wing. AVP of College Affairs 
Leonard Bobbitt encouraged 
council to remain active in getting 
students to vote on the Division I 
referendum, even though only two 
days remain in the election.
      “Really push [voting on the 
election] because every student’s 
voice does matter in this,” Bobbitt 
said. “Let democracy run free and 
freedom for everyone.”
       Madnick was disappointed 
when announcing this week’s 
Councilmember of the Week, as 
the recipient was not present at 
Wednesday’s meeting.
       “It’s [AVP of Student Services] 
Leigh Mason, and I’ll make her 
do the embarrassing runway thing 
next week,” Madnick said. 

Hopefully she reads this so she 
can prepare an awesome runway 
show for next week. No pressure, 
Mason.
       Council sang an enthusiastic 
“happy birthday” song to 
Campuswide Senator Matthew 
Bradbury. I’m sure Bradbury will 
be excited to legally join council 
during its occasional after-meeting 
trips to Porter’s Pub.

Research from the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography is being 
used as the guideline for a new cli-
mate change initiative launched by 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 
on Feb. 16. This new environmental 
preservation campaign is officially 
known as the “Climate and Clean 
Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived 
Climate Pollutants Initiative.” 

According to Scripps, Clinton 
said that this coalition —  formed 
by the United States, Canada, 
Bangladesh, Ghana, Mexico, 
Sweden and the United Nations 
Environment Programme — is the 
first ongoing international effort 
with a high  level of participation, 
and is looking for solutions to stop 
the spread of short-lived pollutants.

“It will mobilize resources, 
assemble political support, help 
countries develop and implement 
a national action plan, raise public 
awareness and reach out to other 

countries, companies, NGOs and 
foundations,” Clinton said in a press 
release. 

In January, Dr. Veerabhadran 
Ramanathan — who is Director of 
the Center for Clouds, Chemistry 
and Climate at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography — and 
colleagues issued a UNEP report 
that identified 16 possible actions. 
These actions included replacing 
inefficient cook stoves, stopping the 
burning of agricultural waste and 
adopting emissions standards on 
vehicles.  

Incorporating these changes 
would be small steps toward the goal 
of limiting the rise in global temper-
ature to two degrees, Ramanathan 
said. 

“This is a significant step towards 
fighting climate change that the 
world has been waiting for, for such 
a long time,” Dr. Ramanathan said.

According to Scripps, the 
UNEP report, along with the rest 
of Ramanathan’s work on climate 
change, is the foundation for this 

initiative. Ramanathan’s work on 
climate change dates back to 1975, 
when he identified chlorofluoro-
carbons (such as refrigerants and 
propellants) as significant factors in 
climate change.

“[The initiative] will also have a 
major impact in reducing air pol-
lution and its negative impacts on 
health and the food security of devel-
oping nations,” Ramanathan said.

Clinton has said that she is opti-
mistic about the prospects of the 
new campaign.

“The range of countries, organi-
zations and industries gathered in 
this room today reflects the weight 
of scientific research showing that 
climate change is one of the most 
serious and complex problems fac-
ing our world,” Clinton said. “When 
we discover effective and affordable 
ways to reduce global warming, not 
by a little but by a lot, it is a call to 
action for all of us.”

The results from the biggest day of the Republican primaries thus far are in. Conservative 
America has spoken. Super Tuesday, 
a 10-state primary contest with 437 
delegates at stake, is the ultimate 

decider of the political fates of 
frontrunners Mitt Romney and Rick 
Santorum and their trailing opponents 
Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul. 

Historically, March 7 isn’t the 
biggest, most crucial Super Tuesday 
— four years ago, it was a battle for 
24 states. This year, it has come down 
to 10 — Alaska, Georgia, Idaho, 
Massachusetts, North Dakota, Ohio, 
Oklahoma, Tennessee, Virginia 
and Wyoming. Victories in these 
10 states will be crucial to securing 
the 1,144 delegates necessary to win 
the nomination.  Super Tuesday 
might have featured 10 states, but in 
the end, it all came down to Ohio. 
In one of the closest primary races 
since Iowa in January, Romney 
again edged Santorum out with 38 
percent of the vote, narrowly besting 
Santorum’s 37 percent. This, coupled 
with Romney’s clear victories in the 
more predictable states of Virginia, 
Vermont, Massachusetts and Idaho, 
essentially solidifies Romney’s status 
as frontrunner of the Republican 
nomination with a total of 415 
delegates. 

Still, this isn’t exactly the knockout 
punch for Santorum. He picked up 
important victories in Tennessee, 
Oklahoma and North Dakota and 
provided a real nail biter of a race for 
Romney in Ohio, coming to a total 
of 187 delegates. These crucial wins 
(even without the big prize of the 
night, Iowa) are enough to poke holes 
in Romney’s aura of invulnerability 
and never-ending wealth. After all, 
if a social conservative so far right 
that he is isolating female voters 
can still be a serious contender for 
Romney, clearly something is wrong 
with his campaign.  In other news, 
Newt Gingrich is running in his very 
own race, untainted by anything 
as bothersome as an opponent. 
Therefore, Georgia was a big win for 
Newt Gingrich. It was actually his 
only win. But if he had failed to snag 
his crucial home state on Tuesday, his 
presidential hopes would effectively be 
over. Gingrich’s campaign is revived 
for now — but only just.

Early predictions about a possible 
Ron Paul victory in Alaska — which 
would have marked his very first in 
these primaries — fell through, as 
Paul failed to pick up even a single 
state, keeping his delegate count steady 
at a low 47.  Right now, Romney 
seems to be the only candidate of the 
four remaining with actual chances 
of securing the nomination. In the 
coming month, large swaths of the 
Republican Party will slowly begin to 
accept the inevitability of Romney’s 
election, even if the acceptance stems 
from a desperate need to just secure a 
nominee. The longer the nominations 
draw on and prod holes in the 
Romney, the frontrunner, the slimmer 
the chances the Republicans have to 
beat Obama.

m1yau@ucsd.eduThe November UC Davis pepper spray incident resurfaced this past week, this time in 
the form of a blocked University of 
California-mandated investigative 
report. At the behest of the UC 
police union, Alameda County Judge 
Evelio Grillo temporarily blocked the 
release of the report 
due to an alleged illegal 
release of confidential 
information in the 
report. It is a jumbled 
mess of whether the 
police had the right to 
issue a court injunction 
(the police department 
hasn’t even seen the 
report), but one thing 
is clear — the report, 
in its entirety, ought 
to be released as 
soon as possible. Yet 
given the discussion 
regarding the legality 
of the information in 
the report, a compromise between 
the drafters of the report and the UC 
police union may have to occur before 
the information can be released.

The police actions in question 
occurred Nov. 18 when the UC 
Davis campus police pepper sprayed 
a row of seated students who were 
protesting as part of the college 
Occupy movement — a violation 
of authority that quickly garnered 
outrage in social media spheres. The 
consequential widespread student 
and public outrage spurred UC 

President Mark G. Yudof and UC 
Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi to 
form an independent task force to 
investigate the incident and provide 
feedback for preventing future 
conflicts. The task force looked like 
a suitable administrative action to all 
involved since it would consist of a 

cross section of students, 
faculty, staff and other 
UC community members.

The release of 
the report, originally 
scheduled for 30 days 
after the incident, was 
later pushed back to 
March 6 and as a result 
of the court injunction, 
further pushed back. 
After a March 16 
court hearing with the 
attorneys for each side, 
Judge Grillo will decide 
whether the report can 
be released, and in what 
form. 

The Federated University Police 
Officers Association claims that the 
report contains confidential personnel 
information about the officers, while 
UC attorneys insist that no such 
information exists in the report, 
according to a March 7 Huffington 
Post article “Judge blocks UC from 
releasing pepper-spray report.” 

Currently, only task force members 
(attorneys included) know all of the 
information in the report, so it seems 

Access Denied
An investigative report regarding the UC Davis pepper-spray incident has been blocked by 

the UC police union, an injunction that can only be solved through compromise.

rather absurd that the UC police union could make 
a move to block an injunction that they have not yet 
seen. Without the vital knowledge that only the task 
force holds, the UC police union risks hurting its own 
reputation and the reputation of the Davis police force 
with their court injunction. 

According to the March 7 Inside Higher Ed article 
“More Angst Over Pepper Spray,” Cruz Reynoso, the 
chair of the task force, says that preventing the public 
from finding out the full report will hurt the police 
because they will lose the public’s confidence regarding 
their job proficiency, as well as hurt the public who 
want to be informed about the incident. Clearly, a 
compromise needs to be reached between the task 
force and the police union, one that will push the 
report toward completion and release. 

One such compromise can be found in the issue 
of name recognition. In the union’s request for a 
restraining order, the police officers are referred to 
by such names as “Roe” and “Doe.” Pike is identified, 

but his name has long been known to the public. 
It is understandable that the other officers do not 
want their names released — in the aftermath of the 
incident, Pike was forced to change his phone number 
and abandon his home when he began receiving death 
threats, according to the Inside Higher Ed article. It 
might be a worthy trade-off for the officers in the 
investigative report to be anonymously designated, so 
that the legal barrier can be lifted and the report can 
be released immediately. That way, the report can skirt 
any of the legal issues that the union is claiming, and 
will be able to do what the creators of the task force 
like Yudof intended — recommending solutions for 
the current incident and those that may occur in the 
future.

It’s been months since the incident, and both the 
students and the public deserve to have some closure 
on the subject through transparent access to the facts. 
The investigative report needs to be released as soon as 
possible — a feat that can only be achieved through a

Dear Editor,
I am a UCSD (undergraduate) 

alumnus and a current graduate 
student at the University of 
Arizona. I read your editorial 
regarding the Division-I 
athletics referendum, “Keep The 
Change.” 

I will preface my comments 
by saying that I am an avid sports 
fan and support the Division-I 
referendum, even though as an 
alum I cannot vote. 

As a Warren College student, 
I was always encouraged to “live 
a life in balance.” While there 
are many prestigious academic 
institutions such as those you 
mentioned that do not have 
Division-I athletics, there are 
many examples of schools which 
do achieve a balance between the 
two, such as Stanford, UCLA, UC 
Berkeley, Harvard and Princeton, 
among others, and I feel that this 
is a model which UCSD should 
try to emulate, with or without 
football. 

In the coming weeks, 
the nation’s attention will 
be captivated by the NCAA 
Division I Men’s Basketball 
tournament, colloquially known 
as “March Madness.” While a 
football team may never happen, 
March Madness appearances, 
another source of school spirit, 
are well within the realm 
of reasonable possibility, as 
evidenced by the UCSD Women’s 
Basketball team’s recent success.

Also, in the editorial you 
state that schools such as 
Oklahoma State University 
and the University of Arizona 
are “athletics powerhouses 

with horrible academics.” In 
my opinion, it is reckless 
journalism and an insult to 
the many students, faculty and 
staff who work hard to make 
the University of Arizona a 
fine academic institution to 
characterize it in such a manner. 
Any Division-I institution will 
have some student athletes who 
do not fit the first half of that 
title, but to characterize entire 
universities like this, without 
giving any quantitative evidence, 
is irresponsible. 

The University of Arizona 
is one of the leaders in the field 
of astronomy. Additionally, the 
University of Arizona operates 
the Phoenix Mars Mission, which 
aims to “study the history of 
water and search for complex 
organic molecules in the ice-
rich soil of the martian arctic” 
(taken from the NASA Phoenix 
Mars Mission fact sheet). Its 
Steward Observatory operates 
the Mount Graham International 
Observatory, which serves as 
an observatory for the Vatican 
Observatory. At the Steward 
Observatory’s mirror lab, 
telescope mirrors are cast, 
including ones which are (or will 
become) part of the Magellan 
telescope in Chile.

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |THURSDAY, MARCH 8,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

P icture “Law & Order” minus the law part, and on crack — that’s NBC’s new mid-season replace-
ment “Awake.” Admittedly, the quality 
of the show is a surprise coming from 

writer Kyle Krillen, creator of the 
failed “Lonestar,” but this time he’s got 
a highly original concept that could 
give “Inception” a run for its money. 

After a major car accident, police 
detective Michael Britten (Jason 
Isaacs) finds himself alternating 
between a pair of realities where his 
wife dies in one, and his son dies in 
another. Visiting different shrinks in 
the two worlds (played, ironically, by 
“Law & Order”’s B.D. Wong and a 
rather irritating Cherry Jones) doesn’t 
seem to help either, as each shrink in 
each world fervently tries to convince 
him that the other world is fake. The 
mind trip occurs when different cases 
Britten works on, in different realities, 
mysteriously crossover.

The contrast between the strained 
father-son relationship in one reality 
and the marital husband-wife relation-
ship in the the other is particularly 
poignant. In one world, Britten finds 
that he’s unable to communicate with 
his son since he let his wife take up 
that responsibility while he worked 
his long hours on cases. In the other 
world, Britten finds that he’s unable to 
fill the void of losing a child, finding 
that his wife wants to move out and 
have more kids in order to move on.

Although the extremely nuanced 
performances by Isaacs and the rest of 
the talented cast bring the writing to 
life, Krillen dabbles too much in the 
little details. The constant, unrefined 
switching between the two worlds, the 
two shrinks and the two cases in ques-
tion can get a bit tedious to watch.

Instead of finding creative transi-
tions where the audience progressively 
becomes cognizant that they’re watch-
ing another reality (like in “Inception,” 
where Ellen Page’s character Ariadne 
slowly becomes aware that she’s in a 
constructed world), Krillen’s transi-
tions are very formulaic. He sticks to 
the strategy of progressing the plot by 
having a different shrink ask Britten 
about what is happening in the other 
reality. Once repeated, this strategy 
begins to grow old. 

Also, since the show seems to want 
to support the notion that each reality 
is equally real, it’s entirely logical to 
come to the conclusion that none of 
the realities are real at all and Britten 
is actually in a coma (an idea similar 
to the 2011 sci-fi flick “Source Code”). 
That sort of predictable answer to 
the problem at hand does not create 
an environment where “Awake” can 
survive for more than a season. Other 
psycho-thrillers like “Dollhouse” 
clearly accounted for this sort of prob-
lem: After Eliza Dushku’s character, 
Echo, attains self-awareness, and the 
focus shifts to the new set of problems 
that the self-awareness created.

Regardless, “Awake” has a huge 
amount of mind-crushing potential. If 
Krillen can manage to tighten up the 
script, he could really attain a cult fol-
lowing that rivals J.J. Abrams’ “Lost.”

This Mind 
Trip is Easy

W hile most middle schoolers filed awkwardly into the band room for the first time, blindly 
picking from the array of polished gadgets 
that lined the walls, UCSD Masters of 
Performance candidate Stephen Solook was 
fully aware of his destiny. 

“I started playing percussion in 4th 
grade,” Solook told the Guardian in an 
email interview. “I can still recall the day 
before we were told we could select instru-
ments to take lessons for in school, and remember specifically thinking that I 
knew exactly what instrument I wanted to play.”

Solook continued playing percussion, first in high school and then again 
at Ithaca College, where he played mallets in the pit ensemble with the now-
defunct Rochester Patriots. 

“Because it was not a Division-I corp, other members seemed to treat it 
more like a high school drama fest rather than a competing organization,” 
Solook said. “I took it extremely seriously, and people throughout the organi-
zation singled me out in a positive manner for the effort.”

After moving to New York City and receiving his Masters at Mannes 
College of Music, Solook had already built a reputable career as a full-time 
performing musician, playing with various orchestras and world music 
ensembles in the city. But Solook had another career path in mind.

“I’ve had a goal and dream of having my own percussion studio at the 
collegiate level,” Solook said. “So it was time to come back to school before I 
wouldn’t want to. UCSD was one of the only schools in the world I wanted to 
go to, and fortunately it worked out.”

Steven Schick’s world-famous graduate percussion studio and Red Fish 
Blue Fish ensemble accepted Solook in 2009. At UCSD, Solook has worked 
on a variety of projects with Red Fish Blue Fish, including this Sunday’s 
performance at Conrad Prebys Music Center, also curated by Solook. The 
program will include percussion works by Chinary Ung, Philippe Manoury 
and Katharina Rosenberger, as well as Roger Reynolds’ theatre/musical 
piece Justice, which was commissioned for the celebration of the Library of 

Congress’ Bicentennial in 2000. 
“Katharina Rosenberger’s Settings of E.E. Cummings are a world premiere 

and are amazing examples of how percussion and voice can and do become 
similar on a phonetic and rudimental level,” Solook said. “Chinary Ung’s 
Cinnabar Heart is scored for solo singing marimbist and is loosely inspired 
by Cambodian folk music.”

The centerpiece of the evening, however, is Reynolds’ Justice — a fully 
staged, Greek-inspired dramatic piece written for percussionist (Solook), 
soprano (Tiffany Du Mouchelle), actress (Alice Teyssier) and computer musi-
cian (Paul Hembree). 

“Justice is based on the ancient Greek tragedy Clytemnestra, and the 
nightmare-reality of her husband, Agamemnon, killing their daughter, 
Iphigenia, for permission to go to war, leading her to action against his 
injustices,” Solook said. “Starting on Thursday a sound installation will run 
24 hours a day until the performance with musical elements that are from 
Illusion, the work that follows Justice chronologically. lllusion deals with the 
ancient Greek figure Kassandra and her dealings of premonitions.”

But Justice is only the first of Solook’s several upcoming projects.
“Related to the concert, I have a duo, Aurora Borealis, with Tiffany Du 

Mouchelle who is performing the soprano part in Justice.  We have several 
new compositions being written for us to help highlight our new focus of 
equally composed works for voice and percussion. Another long term project 
that is with a non-profit organization, Pacific Blue Foundation, to document 
and locate pre-contact/pre-colonial music in Fiji.”

Solook has built quite an eclectic body of work — a testament to the 
diverse role percussion can have in an ensemble, which is something Solook 
believes is fundamental to the craft.

“In regards to the role I think a percussionist plays, I would like to not 
comment on that,” Solook said. “There is such a variety of ensemble types 
and styles of percussion that I would easily leave off more than I would men-
tion. But what I will say is that percussion is an extremely broad area that 
can allow a person to delve into many different areas, and the only thing that 
limits what you do is yourself.”

The performance is free and will begin at 3 p.m. this Sunday at the Conrad 
Prebys Music Center Black Box.

La Sera is the solo project of Vivian Girls bassist Katie Goodman. Their 
sophomore album Sees the Light comes out on March 24. Though Vivian 
Girls specialized in gleefully sloppy garage pop, Goodman’s La Sera 
project trades in more restrained folk-pop. Expect plenty of woodsy

10 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MARCH 8,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

ALBUM REVIEWS

L ast year, Los Angeles psych scene figurehead Amanda Brown started 100% Silk, a record label devoted 
to releasing DIY, house-indebted dance 
music. After twenty-odd records of 
sleazy, hallucinatory dance floor anthems, 
100% Silk is shifting gears, releasing Fort 
Romeau’s Kingdoms, the debut solo record 

by La Roux keyboardist Mike Norris.
Noticeably, there are no tricks on 

Kingdoms. Unlike the rest of 100% Silk’s 
roster, Fort Romeau refrains from indulg-
ing in disorienting digital textures, broken 
rhythms or over-stimulating vocal sam-
plings, leaving the listener with restrained, 
well-crafted night-drive house music. 
Norris’ background with relatively high-
budget pop is also quickly evident. These 
tracks resound with the kind of lush 
analog synth work and professional atten-
tion to detail that’s surprising given Fort 
Romeau’s choice of label.

Opener “Jack Rollin’” makes Norris’ 
intentions clear from the start: Beginning 
with a spacious arrangement of fluttering 
hi-hats, the song quickly evolves into a 
catchy, bass-driven floor filler. Highlight 

“Say Something” finds the perfect intersec-
tion between nocturnal pop and ebullient 
house, sounding like some lost ’90s dance-
pop classic with its vocal refrain of “If it’s 
worth your while, say something to me.”

The rest of the album is more 
restrained than those almost radio-friend-
ly tracks, but no less masterful at creating 
a considerable amount of ambience with-
out losing sight of the groove. This balance 
is what makes Kingdoms so successful. 
By tempering his keen ear for melody 
with the restraint of a skilled producer, 
Norris has managed to create one of the 
most cohesive, vividly-realized electronic 
albums of the year so far.

P ond is an Perth-based Australian band com-posed of Tame Impala 
members Nick Allbrook and 
Jay Watson, along with col-
laborator Joseph Ryan. From 
humble beginnings on local 
Perth label Badminton Bandit, 
their lo-fi bedroom recordings 
Psychedlic Mango, Corridors of 
Blissterday and Frond were all 
psychedelic ramblings, provid-
ing the same lethargic sense 
of delight one might find on a 
lazy afternoon.

Yet despite moving to 
major label Modular, Pond 
appears to have opted out of 
a pop-friendly debut, instead 
moving straight into the 
bearded, reclusive stage many 
bands fall prey to. In fact, Bear, 
Wives, Denim was literally 
born out of exactly the kind of 
idyllic, nature-discovering ses-
sions one would expect from 
such a musical approach; the 
band recorded the album in 
an old country farmhouse. 

Mixed by Tame Impala’s 
Kevin Parker at Poon’s Head 
Studio in Perth, Beard, Wives, 

Denim is more tightly crafted 
than would be expected from 
these perpetually tripped out 
Aussie jammers. These songs 
might lack the refined profes-
sionalism of Tame Impala, 
but it’s clear Pond is stepping 
out of their smoke-filled bed-
room and taking things a bit 
more seriously.

First track “Fantastic 
Explosion Of Time” starts out 
as a fun and nostalgic ode to 

’60s-style psychedelic rock, 
using distorted, fuzzy vocals 
over garage style strums. It 
transitions gracefully into 
next song “When It Explodes,” 
a nonchalant take on psych 
rock, complete with slowed 
down, spacey interludes.

The ’60s influence contin-
ues on “Sorry I Was Under 
The Sky” (more British Mod 
than Allman Brothers, this 
time), and the vocals lead 
the track along a trippy bliss-
ful journey. The track is the 
perfect soundtrack to warm 
summer days.

Beard, Wives, Denim still 
very much captures the ethos 
of Pond — three friends under 
a mulberry tree in Western 
Australia — but this record 
proves that sometimes hip-
pies need to stop kissing the 
sky and get grounded; with 
the studio setup and more 
focused attention, Pond has 
made their best record yet.

E ven after over 20 years as downer pop champions, the Magnetic Fields still bare the flame of romantic cyn-
icism that will continue to haunt socially 
awkward lovers. And after a trilogy of 
stripped down “rock” albums throughout 
the 2000s, Love at the Bottom of the Sea 

also marks a return to the Magnetic Fields’

songs in little over a half an hour. The dif-
ference here is that they are less concerned 
with moping about failed affairs than pok-
ing fun at the struggles of transitioning 
into aging romantics.  

“The Horrible Party” presents a list of 
trivial complaints of egregious drug use 
and distasteful plastic surgery pointed at 
their fellow hedonistic socialite partygoers 
over the backdrop of an electro-orchestral 
waltz, while “God Wants Us to Wait” 
tackles the task of satirizing the outlandish 
narrative of an avid abstinence supporter 
by offering the condolences of “Though it 

would be the perfect end to our date/I love 
you baby but God wants us to wait.”

By halfway in, the consistent baroque 
shuffle of Bottom of the Sea wears thin, 
with the less-inspired instrumentals 
unable to stand on the stilts of Merritt’s 
witty lyricism. Much-needed relief comes 
in the form of the record’s penultimate 
track “Quick!” which could easily be 
mistaken for one of the Fields’ classics. 
With its pop hooks and jangling stomp, 
“Quick!” taps the warm, juvenile modesty 
that made the Fields’ a household indie-
rock name, though it ultimately serves as a 
mere mental note to give their ramshackle, 
lo-fi opus 69 Love Songs one more spin.

two 6–0 sets against Villanova’s Ryan 
Peyton, while underclassmen Max Jiganti 
and Luu also took their matches in two 
sets. Villanova’s only win on the day 
came in the No. 5 singles bout, with Tim 
Abbracciamento overtaking Ling.

The following day, the Tritons faced 
Western New Mexico University, taking a 
7–2 victory over the Mustangs. 

“[Villanova] had some strong players 
that matched up really well against us, and 
they just got the better of us in a couple of 
those matches,” Willing said.  “But overall 
everyone took charge early.”

The Tritons swept in the doubles 
component, and took four of their six 
matches in singles competition. 

No. 1 singles Chan, No. 2 singles 
Yoshida, No. 4 singles Jiganti and No. 6 
singles Yuu all won in straight matches. 

No. 3 singles West lost 6–3, 6–4, while 
No. 5 singles Ling dropped a tight 7–6, 7–5 
match.

The Tritons continue their homestand. 
Their next dual competition is against No. 
21 Hawaii-Pacific this Saturday, March 10 
at 10 a.m.

GAME 1
UCSD VS SAN BERNARDINO 9-0

    After going without a hit for the first four 
innings, the Tritons recorded five runs on six 
hits during their next turn at the plate.  
    In the fifth inning, sophomore Caitlin 
Brown and junior Dyanna Imoto both singled 
to get on base, advancing to second and third 
respectively off a throwing error. Brown was 
batted in by freshman Monique Portugal, 
as the Tritons went up by one run. Next up, 
junior designated hitter and right-hander 
Jennifer Manuel hit a big double to left field 
for two RBI. Back at the top of the batting 
order, senior Kris Lesovsky homered to put 
the Tritons up 5–0. The hit was Lesovsky’s 
26th career homerun. 
    Senior pitcher Camille Gaito kept the 
Coyotes hitless in the bottom of the fifth 
inning, as the Tritons capped the win with a 
big four run inning in the sixth. 
    With bases loaded sophomore Mya Romero 
sent a homerun to center field, and the 
Tritons went up 9–0.

 
GAME 2

UCSD VS SAN BERNARDINO 10-1
    The Tritons finished their second game 

within five innings. Hitting in the leadoff 
spot, Lesovsky hit right-hander Abreanna 
Landeros for a homerun in the first inning. 
The Tritons tacked on another run in the 
second inning, and in the third capitalized on 
three San Bernardino errors to record three 
more runs. 
    The Coyotes registered their only run in 
the third inning, off of only one hit. Freshman 
pitcher Michelle Escamilla records the win, 
in her first complete game as a Triton. The 
freshman had a standout performance, 
allowing just four hits in five innings. 
    UCSD closed out the game in the fifth 
inning, as Lesovsky picked up her second 
RBI off of a double to left center. Romero 
and sophomore catcher Charly Swanberg 
both popped up to bring in two more runs, 
and Brown homered to left center to put the 
Tritons up 10–1.

GAME 3
UCSD VS CSU SAN BERNARDINO 3-2

UCSD recorded all three of their runs 
in the first inning. In the leadoff position, 
Lesovsky singled to right field, advancing 
to third on a Romero walk and a Swanberg 
single. With bases loaded, San Bernardino 
pitcher Courtney Wilhelms walked the 
next two batters, to put the Tritons up 2–0. 
UCSD picked up one more run, scoring off a 
groundout. The Coyotes staged a comeback, 

registering runs in the fourth and sixth 
innings, but it wasn’t enough to push the 
games into extra innings. The win was UCSD 
head coach Patti Gerckens’ 500th career win. 
In her 20th season, Gerckens has a 500–440 
all-time record.

GAME 4
UCSD VS CSU SAN BERNARDINO 4-5  
    The Tritons registered eight hits, but only 
managed to convert four in the last game 
of the series.  CSU San Bernardino went 
up early in the bottom of the first inning, 
scoring two runs off a Triton error and a 
sacrifice bunt.  
    UCSD took one back in the fourth inning, 
as Brown advanced to third off a Portugal 
bunt and was brought home on a sacrifice fly 
from senior Tess Granath.

Down just 2–1, Gerckens brought 
in Manuel to relieve Escamilla. But San 
Bernardino pitcher Courtney Wilhelms hit 
Manuel for a solo homerun in the fourth, 
while junior Alyssa Flores launched another 
one out of the park for two RBI. 

UCSD tacked on three more runs off 
doubles from Lesovsky and Swanberg, but 
it was too little too late as San Bernardino 
walked away with the win in the series finale.

Baseball Splits Against CSU East Bay
BY NICK HOWE
Associate Sports Editor

GAME 1
UCSD VS CSU EAST BAY 5-4

The Tritons battled throughout 
the game, culminating in a big 
three-run homer off the bat of 
first baseman Richard Siegal in the 
fourth inning. 
    In the bottom of the third 
inning, the Pioneers took an early 
2–0 leadoff with two hits and an 
error, but their lead was short-
lived. The top of the fourth saw 
pinch-hitter Gregg Ringold double 
to left field. Designated hitter Nick 
LaFace then reached second on an 
error, which also moved Ringold 
to third. With men on first and 
third, Pioneer pitcher Bryce Miller 
lost a bit of command enough to 
put it right in the wheelhouse for 
Seigel, making the game 3–2. 
    The Pioneers responded in 
the bottom of the fourth inning, 
to take back the lead. Ryan 
Goodbrand, the Triton hurler and 
NCBWA West Region Pitcher 
of the Week, allowed a single, 
hit Pioneer shortstop Eddie 
Retagliatta and then threw a pass 
ball to advance the two Pioneers 
to third and first. They were 
batted in on a single to left for a 
4–3 Pioneer lead.

    In the top of the fifth, junior 
Danny Susdorf struck out 
swinging but managed to reach 
on a catcher’s error. The junior 
stole second and was then brought 
home by Ringold, who singled to 
left. 
    Tied at 4–4, the Tritons 
manufactured the winning run by 
bunting Siegel to third, where he 
was batted in off Northrop flying 
out to center field.

GAME 2
UCSD VS CSU EAST BAY 5-6

The first of Saturday’s games 
went to the Pioneers even though 
the Tritons took the early lead 
with a run in the second inning. 
Shortstop Garrett Tuck singled to 
left field to extend his hit streak to 
11 games. With two men on base, 
Michaels then flied out to right 
field for the sacrifice and the first 
run of the game.
    CSU East Bay came back with a 
one run inning in the third, where 
they scored off a fielder’s choice. 
    The Triton bats really came 
to life in the fifth inning, where 
the team racked up three runs 
on just one hit, capitalizing on 
the Pioneer’s poor pitching and 
shoddy in-field play. Ringold 
doubled down the left field line to 
score Susdorf. Ringold would later 

score on a wild pitch.
    The two teams were tied at five 
runs apiece going into the ninth 
inning, and were still tied coming 
out of it, sending the game into 
extra innings. The Tritons had a 
good chance to score at the top of 
the tenth, but left a man on base. 
The Pioneers shut the door with a 
run scored off a fielder’s choice to 
take the game by one run.

GAME 3
UCSD VS CSU EAST BAY 2-3

The Tritons again battled 
the entire game against a tough 
Pioneer defense, only to lose the 
lead to a stellar Pioneer comeback 
in the sixth inning.
    The Tritons manufactured a run 
in both the first and third innings. 
Unfortunately, Tuck’s hitting 
streak finally came to an end as he 
went 0-for-4, but he did succeed 
in driving in Susdorf by forcing a 
fielder’s choice in the third.
    Trevor Scott, the Triton starter, 
was strong through five innings, 
but started to flag in the sixth, 
when the Pioneer bats started to 
come alive. They took three runs 
on two hits and left one man on 
base to go ahead and score the 
final run in Saturday’s meeting. 
Scott falls to 1–2 on the season.

GAME 4
UCSD VS CSU EAST BAY 4-1

Keeping the game scoreless 
until the fourth inning, Greg 
Selarz started well for the Tritons, 
racking up two strike-outs and 
giving up only one run despite 
eight Pioneer hits. He moves 
himself to 2–1 on the season and 
the Tritons to 6–6 in CCAA play. 

Tuck busted out two hits in 
three at-bats while Susdorf went 
three for four. Susdorf started the 
fourth inning rally that resulted 
in a run by singling to right and 
scoring on a sac-fly by LaFace. 
    Leading off the sixth inning, 
Susdorf again led the Triton 
offensive with a single to right. 
Ringold followed with a single up 
the middle to move Susdorf to 
third. Reminiscent of the fourth 
inning, LaFace again flied out to 
bring Susdorf home. Tuck then 
doubled to left to move Ringold 
over to third. They both came 
in via a Scott Liske single up the 
middle.
    Down by four, the Pioneers 
couldn’t put together a rally until 
the seventh inning, where they 
scored only one run.

With back-to-back wins at home against Division-I Villanova and Western New 
Mexico University, the No. 16 UCSD Men’s 
Tennis team has taken their eighth straight 
win in dual competition.

The Tritons have only recorded one team 
loss this season, a 2–7 loss against No. 15 
Grand Canyon University on Feb. 10 at the 
Grand Canyon Invitational, where they were 
trounced in the doubles component. 

But on Tuesday, March 6 against the 
Wildcats, the Tritons showed strong from the 
start. Having just returned from the Pacific 
Coast Doubles Championships, UCSD took 
wins in all three doubles matches. 

The No. 1 doubles match pitted UCSD’s 
Austin West and Devon Sousa — a pair that 
qualified for the ITA National Small College 
Championships last October — against 
Villanova’s Thomas O’Brien and Kelly 
Donaldson. West and Sousa struggled at the 
start of the match, as O’Brien and Donaldson 
managed to break serve early. Momentum 
swung to the Tritons in the seventh set, when 
UCSD broke the Villanova pair’s service 
game, taking the game and ultimately the 

match 8–4.
“We had a little bit of erratic play in the 

beginning,” UCSD assistant coach Timmer 
Willing said. “It was a bit of a back-and-forth 
at the start. They had a few bigger hitters, but 
they did make a lot more errors. We were a 
little bit uneasy at first, and we took a little 
longer to gain control of the match, but we 
ultimately did by the end.”

On the other end of the Northview Tennis 
Courts, UCSD’s No. 3 doubles pairing of Sam 
Ling and Junya Yoshida won their match 8–5. 

The newly-formed No. 2 doubles team of 
Jason Wall and Kona Luu overcame an early 
deficit to take their match, 9–7.

“It makes a big difference when you win 
all three doubles,” Willing said. “It leaves a lot 
more room for error there. It lets everybody 
relax a little bit and not have so much 
pressure on winning or losing.”

It turned out that the Tritons didn’t 
need the early lead to take the win. UCSD 
proceeded to take wins in all but one of their 
six singles matches. No. 1 singles Chapman 
Chan topped O’Brien with scores of 2–6, 6–2, 
11–9, while No. 2 Junya Yoshida also won his 
bout in three sets. 

West secured the No. 3 singles with
