Problems? Try 
picking up the 
phone for help 

by Kitty RobWoD 
Copy EdItor 

Arrivin, heme from school one 
evening, you find a note from your 
landlord informing you that you 
will be evicted from your ar-
partment in tine days. Who can 
you call for informaUon about your 
legal rights in tbia situation? 

Your roommate bas taken an 
overdose of drugs and is 
threatening to commit suicide. Is 
there someone who can tell you 
how to calm him down? 

A group ~ graduate and un-
dergraduate students, represen-
ting all four colleges at UCSD, has 
been working for the past year to 
establish a telephone crisis hotline 
on campus. Comprised enUrely ~ 
volunteers, the group has un-
dergone extensive training, 
preparing them to deal with a wide 
variety of emergency situations. 

The phone counselling center 
will be located in the old computer 
tenninal, Muir Lower Commons, 
next to the CAPE office. 'lbe 
phones will be manned duriaC 
evening hours, untU about 2:00 
a.m. HoweY_. tbe lHYice will not 
start unW tile ftftb week ~ cluIes. 

At a meeting for new volunteers 
held last Tufllday ~, organizer 
David Harris stressed the need for 
persons who are willing to receive 
"extensive training in the areas ~ 
listening skills, learning to handle 
legal problems, dealing with 
depression, drug counselling and 
learning to idenUty with somebody 
who is different than you." Added 
another organizer, Sue Maynard, 
"We need everybody. Anything 
you can do will be a great help." 

Campus-Wide Organization 
The phone counselling project 

began last year when Muir Cpllege 
Dean Jim Beckley expressed 
concern over the fact that no such 
service was available to the UCSD 
community-or, in fact, to the 
entire North County area. Initially, 
Beckley worked with members of 
Page One, the peer counselling 
center of M~lr college. Soon, 
however, the phone counselling 
group broke away from Page One, 
becoming a campus-wide 
organization. 

The first step the group made 
toward establishing the hotline was 
to send a survey to a random 
selection of UCSD students in order 
to determine whether or not they 
would use a phone colHlselling 
service. "A great deal of thought 
and care went into finding out if 
such a service is needed here," 
stated Beckley. 

The results of the survey showed 
"an overwhebning response in 
favor" of establishing a hotline, 
according to Ellen Rosenbluth, one 
of the original founders ~ the 
project. 

Along with Todd Schacbtman, 
Ethan Munson and, Bob Rubinyi, 
Rosenbluth then contacted crisis 
centers in the San Diego area. such 
as United Way, the Help Center 
and DEFY, a clrq crills line. In 
order to design an effective 
training pl"Olf8lD for ~

Commentary 
AS actions spur request 

for Quad-Council. meeting 
by ADdy Schneider 

Associate News Editor 
To resolve a growing rift with the 

new Associated Students, the Muir 
Student Caucus has called for 
quad-coWlCil meeting of the four 
college governments. 

Misinfonnation and rumors have 
fueled speculation about the 
motivations behind the summer 
reorganization of the Student 

Center charter. Disagreement 
centers around the composition of 
the board's membership. Muir 
College Council member Kelly 
Texeira called it "one issue that 
has sent tremors through the 
system. It's time for the system to 
be tested. " 

The new charter which has been 
approved by the AS and the

The UC library plan: 
Books to depart in 82 
Proposal has become UC policy ... 
will be used to obtain funds from state 

by Reed Alpert 
Assistant News Editor 

A week is a long time to wait for 
a book if you have a paper due and 
need the information. But this may 
become routine for UCSD students. 

The UC library plan to move 
books out of campus libraries and 
into two regional storage centers 
has become University policy. 

A publication called " The 
University Libraries: A plan for 
development, 1977-78" has been 
released by the Office of the 
Executive Director of University 
wide Library Planning and will be 
used to obtain fundini from the 
California State Legislature. 

John Haak, Associate University 
Librarian, said that the UCSD 
libraries will not reach capacity 
until 1982, so book movements will 
not begin until then. The plan calls 
for UCSD to ship 125,000 books in 

1982~ and a total of 582,000 by 
1988. 

If the plan is implemented, the 
books will be shipped to two 
regional storaae centen, one in the 
San Francisco Bay Area and one in 
the Los Angeles area. Eventually 
the facilities would hold three 
million volwnes each. Students on 
individual campuses would have 
access to the stored volumes 
through a microfilm catalogue on 
their own campuses. Requested 
volumes would be delivered within 
24 hours to one week. 

Dr. Paul Saltman, Vice-
chancellor of Academic Affairs, 
said the pian will "harm us a great 
deal because UCSD is a growing 
campus, a campus not close to one 
of the (regional storage) centers." 

Saltman expressed skepticism 
for the funding plan, saying that 
after it is obtained, "how the 
money will be spent is anybody's 
guess. " 

Haak Wants An Alternate Plan 
Raak said. "We feel there should 

be an alternate plan," preferably a 
storage facility at UCSD to house 
infrequently used books but con-
tinue to have them available on 
short notice. He feels this "is a 
more economical approach and 
provides greater access to the 
users." 

The method of choosing those 
volumes which will be shipped has 
not been developed yet. Haak said 
the UCSD libraries plan to hire 
someone to study the system and 
determine the needs of the library.

UC will not be 
challenging 
court ruling 

UC will not challenge the federal 
court ruling which admitted Rita 
Oaney into UC Davis medical 
school, university spokespersons 
said Tuesday. 

Citing the high cost of an appeal, 
representatives said that although 
they feel confidant that the 
Supreme Court would overturn the 
order, the university would prefer 
to wait until the Bakke case is 
heard on Oct. 12. 

Allan Bakke, in a similar case to 
Oancy's, sued the university on 
grounds that he was denied ad-
mission to the UC Davis medical 
school because of an admissions 
program which reserves a 
specified number of spaces for 
minority students. 

The California Supreme Court 
ruled that preferential treatment 
for students on the basis of racial 
background is unconstitutional. 
The University will begin oral 
arguments for their appeal in mid· 
October.

The fallacies contained in the S()o 
caUed "open letter" are many, and 
can best be answered by counter-
example. The letter purports to 
attack the "unrepresentative 
nature" of the Charter, aDeging 
that the individual colleges were 
left out of the dec· Jion-making 
process. Yet the majority of the 
Associated Student Council 
members, twelve to be exact, are 
college representatives. 

Under the control of the old 
Student Center Board, the Student 
Center was a fuD administrative 
unit of the Student Affairs division. 
In the referendwn held durin~ 
Winter Quarter 1977, the students 
voted overwhelmingly to make the 
Student Center independent of the 
Student Affairs division. By this 

~~MiRAClE of LifE" 
of A ViCTO~iAN AGE 

We enjoyed your article on the Park, but you seem to have missed the 
funny~r pitiful-features of the "Miracle of life" show in the Museum of 
Man. Your 7~ admission charge entiUes you to a 100minute show, sup-
posedly explaining to the uninitiated how babies are made. It was gotten 
up, apparently, in the Victorian era, and hasn't been updated since. The 
audience is subjected to a set of extremely faded and generally in-
consequential slides of people at work and play. (One, I think, shows a 
woman nursing a child, though it's so out of focus that one can't be sure.) 
Then there are two diagrams of naked (wow !) male and female forms, 
and a sonorous monologue indicated the differences in width of shoulders, 
etc. Babies, it seems, are generated by family life: how, they don 't ex-
plain . No mention ofthe pleasures and pains of intercourse and childbirth 
- and then, I suddenly realized why. The woman~iagram has no external 
orifice: she couldn't even pee, much less make love or babies! 

If that 's an educational exhibit, I'm -well, I must be abnormal!

<lIarter, the A.8. is taking the first 
step in the direction. The effect of 
this new charter is to remove the 
SCB from the aegis of the Reg. Fee 
Committee, and make It ad-
rninstratively responsible to the 
Associated Students, rather than 
the .Reg. Fee. For once the Student 
Center answers to an elected and 
representative government. 

It is Interesting to note that the 
old Student Center Board, which 
the Wednesday letter said was so 
"representative" of the views of 
students at UCSD raised your 
Student Center Fee $4 from the $6 
level it had been established at, to 
$10 per quarter, making it the 
highest Student Union fee in the 
U.C. system. At the time, if the 
Student Center had to answer to 
the Associated Students, it is 
doubtful if the fee would have been 
raised by that amount, if at all. 

It is clear that the Chainnan of 
the old SCB, the unsigned author of 
the Wednesday letter, is concerned 
far more with the loss of personal 
prestige than with student In-
volvement in the Student Center. 
Such an attitude is not conducive to 
helping the Student Center get off 
the ground during its first year of 
student operation.

Commissioner of Academic Affairs 

ERRATUM 
Due to our error, the last lines of 

Wednesday's "open letter" were 
omitted . The letter was indeed 
signed, by Marsha Harris and 
Kevin Cahill , and should have 
concluded: "Has the AS forgotten 
some of their initial goals? This 
sort of elitism, this deliberate 
separation by and between the AS 
and the rest of the student 
populace, will continue to grow 
unless stopped lmmediately ." 
. The Triton Times regrets this 

error. 

BikE shop COMMENTARY ~liMP' ; 
MisREPRESENTS SAXON'S idEAS 

I am dismayed at Mr. Schneider's conunentary on the Bike Shop, 
especially since it comes from someone who proclaims himself a 
"valuable resource" to the Triton Times and hence, by the strangest 
twist of logic, to the campus. To be sure, a commentary is not intended to 
be an exact recapitulation of the past. However, neither should it 
misrepresent those items the commentator chooses to touch 011. 

Saxon's letter of June 14, 1977 to McElroy did much more than. in Mr. 
Schneider's words, "offered three options for the future cI. the bike abop. " 
Simply put, :saxon outJined in precise style his ''thinking on the subject." 
Here is his thought: 

"Over the past year it has been made apparent to me, through 
discussions with members of the Board and with State legialators, that 
continuing to operate bicycle shope at certain University campuses in the 
face of strident opposition by members cI. the local business cmununiUes 
may not be in the best interests of the University. Even though the 

operation of bicycle shops is not illegal, nor against University policy, I 
have noted little sympathy for our position in the Instances where it bas 
been brought to the attemloo of The Regents or State officials. 

"In the present circumstance, there seem to be at least three options to 
consider: 

1. To continue bicycle shop activities just as they are. In effect, this 
option means eittier justifying the operations to the satisfaction cI. the 
other parties, or to continue the operations despite their opposition. We 
have had ample time to develop an acceptable justification for the 
operation of bicycle shope; the fact remains that we have been unable to 
do so. While we probably can continue bicycle shope despite the op-
position to them, this strategy has been unsuccessful to date, and there is 
no reason to believe the future holds any promise. 

2. To discontinue, in whole or in part, the bicycle shop operations which 
give rise to external criticism. OJoosing this option would silence the 
critics, but it would also cause students to lose whatever services or 
convenience campus bicycle shop operations provide. 

3. To arrange, in an equitable manner, for licensed dealers to provide 
campus bicycle services under contract. This might well be the best 
solution. It is the arrangement used at the Berkeley campus, it has not 
given rise to complaints from the community, and it provides studenta 
with all the services and convenience which can reasonably be expected. 
There is ample precedent for providing student services by contracting 
with vendors, and there is no apparent reason to believe that a contract 
service would not meet the bicycle requirements of the San Diego 
campus. 

"Before preparing a reply to the City Council, I wanted you to know 
what my thinking on the subject is, and to invite you to give me your 
thoughts and suggestions." 

Now, I think it clear what Saxon wants to do with our bike shop. I would 
also think that your readers deserve something better than limp com-
mentary.

In response to an advertisement 
in the Triton Times at the begin-
ning of Spring quarter 1977, 45 
people volunteered to undergo a 
rigorous training session, which 
was run by Rosenbluth and Jeff 
Nelson. 

Said Nelson, "Most preparatory 
work involved the recruitment and 
training of volunteers in all areas 
of counselling and referral and 
utilizing facilities and speakers 
[rom the University and the 
community." 

During the course of the quarter r 
volunteers heard presentations by 
a wide variety of people 
representing many groups. 
Speakers included in the twice-
weekly programs were Julie 
Kenney, a Psychological Services 
intern; Raphael Levens. the 
counselling attorney at UCSD. 

Marcia Schlenler, from the Buffalo 
Suicide and Crisis Center; the 
parents of a student who com-
mitted suicide at UCSD two years 
ago; and Kate Comeau, a drug 
counsellor associated with Path-
ways, an alcohol and drug abuse 
help center. 

The most important thing 
volunteers had to learn, said 
Beckley, was to "be responsive to 
things that concern other students, 
from minor issues to serious 
problems. Many calls will just b4! 
people who need someone to listen 
to them for awhile." 

Referral FUe Made 
While most of the calls will be 

handled entirely by the volunteers, 
some callers will need outside help-
-legal aid or pregnancy coun-
selling, for example. For this 
reason, a referral file to be used to 
consult outside organizations for

help was put together over the 
sununer by Todd Schachtman. 

Funding for the project came 
from the Muir CoUege C'.Duncil for 
the project's first quarter of 
operation. Since the organization is 
campus-wide, however, funding 
will be available from the 
Associated Students beginning in 
Winter Quarter, 1978. Members of 
the group also plan to apply for 
financial aid from local, state and 
federal funds. 

Vohmteers are still needed for 
the project. Although involvement 
means giving several hours a week 
to undergo the intense training 
program, the rewards that come 
from this kind of work make it 
worth the time and effort spent. 
The next meeting of the group will 
be Tuesday, Oct. 5 in the Muir

The UC San Diego Math 
Department has emerged. Or at 
least it's come of age with the 
''heights'' of computerization. 

Tony Wood, a programmer at the 
computer center, has developed a 
new adc:kIrop system whicb was 

estimates that the cost for tbIs

proximately '1000. However, be 
noted that the compl&er center 
may use a different kind rl

could lower apenaes.

There is some doubt as to 

whether or not the system will 
continue to be used during the 
Winter Quarter. Dr. Burt Rodin, 
chairman of the math department, 
likes the new procedure, altbough 
he thinks it makes tblDp ~ 
more difficult for the depar1ment. 
He added that be is anxious to hear 
reactions from studeIU.

Located in APM 5129, the new 
add~p card processlnl center 
uses a computerized screen, whicb 
lists the names and section 
numben of aU lower dlvlsion 
mathematics classes wbich are 
still open for enrollment. In ad-
ditim, the screen tells the student 
how many seats remain in eacb 
section. The screen is updated 
continually, providing student. 
with current information. 

In the past, a blackboard w. 
used to list open classes, and u~ 
dates were made manually, which 
meant that information was less 
accurate. Wood feels that the 
present system "reduces 
discrepancies. " 

Processing add-drop cards by 
hand was also slower. "Students 
sometimes had to walt for as long 
as an hour, " said Dr. Donald 
Smith, associate professor of 
mathematics. "Now the waiting 
time is as brief as five minutes." 

The new procedure is simple. If 
the class the student wants Is still 
open, all that is required is to fill 
out a card and give it to one of the 
operators in the processing center; 
no professor signature is required. 
However, if a student wants to get 
into a class which is full, the 
traditional method of pestering a 
professor for a signature must be 
employed. 

. Computerized System 
Preferred 

Smith favors the computerized 
system, because it makes the add-
drop procedure easier for the 
faculty as well as the students. 
From a professor's point of view, 
the old system was difficult 
because when faced by a herd of 
anxious students brandishing add-
drop cards, "the teacher tends to 
sign cards indiscriminately, and 
does not know just how many 
students he has enrolled." 

The big disadvantage of the new 
system is its expense. Smith

includes tine memben appointed 
by the AS President, three from the 
AS Council and a representative rl 
the Graduate Student CouncU. In 
previous years, each college 
council bad made a direct a~ 
pointment to the board. 

In a letter to the four college 
governments and in a diacuasion 
with the Muir Student Caucus, 
former Student Center Board 
<llair Kevin Cahill charged that 
none of the councils had been 
consulted by the AS. He contends 
that "The AS cannot and should not 
have the power to abrogate this 
authority of the college coun-
cils ... The college councils still 
retain authority to appoint 
members to the Student Center 
Board." 

Slaeller ColIDten OwIe 
AS Vice President Mark Sindler, 

who also acted over the summer in 
the dual role of Muir College 
Council Olairperson, countered 
that cahill had been asked for 
consultation, but had not par-
ticipated in the development of the 
new board. 

Referring to the twelve college 
representatives who vote directly 
in the AS Co\Ulcil, Sindier pointed 
out that "The people who put this 
together were a majority from the 
colleges." Inunediate action on the 
charter, he believes, was the result 
of "great concern about the han-
dling of the Student Center budget 
and the huge fee increase im-
plemented without consulting

prefer the new system. "You JUIt 
go in and band them the card," 
said one undergraduate. Many 
students wbo have used the new 
system agreed that tbe new 
procedure is beUer becauae of the 
shorter time spent waiting in line 
and the eale of not havlng to obtain 
the professor's signature in order 
to enroll. 

Could other departmera \lie this 
same system? PouIbly, said 
Wood, but be pointed olt that the 
new system worb particularly 
weD for the mathematics depm'-
tment because it has more lower 
dlvisim studeIa elW'Olled than any 
other departmem. , 

students. We moved to bring the 
board under the wing of a 
representative body." 

When passed by the AS CoWl~, 
the charter was called a landmark 
measure wblch gave students a far 
greater role in the policy and 
operation ofthe center. 

Quad·O,..cD caDed 
Supported by Slneller and Cahill, 

intense debate ended in the 
decision to call a quad<oWlcU. 
Muir College Council member Bev 
Dance asked, "Let's forget about 
what happened in the past. There 
are changes that need to be made 
to make it a representative 
process. The college coWlcils 
deserve full information on tbis 
issue." 

An AS centralization of 
responsibility for the center 
brought into focus the cloudy in-
terface between the central 
government and the college 
councils. Texeira outlined the 
essence of college concern. "The 
problem is where the power of the 
college council and the AS lies. It 
shouldn't be a fight, but a definition 
of roles. Each college council 
needs to decide its relationship to 
the AS and the role of the college 
reps on the AS Council." 

Dance added that "It's not a 
matter of college council versus 
AS. It should be college councils 
working together with AS, students 
working with students."

Freacb KJu, Bob Welch (Capitol) 
Welch'S album marb hill debut 

as a solo artist. He WIllI a member 
of Fleetwood Mac for five albums 
and had his own group, Pmia, 
which produced two albumI. He'. 
now managed by Mlck Fleetwood, 
who somehow IICpIeeHI in enough 
time between bia own bud'. 
engagements to manage Welch. 

The solo album WIllI produced, 
for the mOlt part, by Capitol'. Joim

Christine McVle and UndIIey 
Buckingham produced Welcb'. 
remake of the cla8Iic "SentimemaI 
Lady" (wblch Weicb orlglnaUy 
wrote and sang on the Mac's Bare 
Treesalbum). 

It is the opening cut, "Sen-
timental Lady," that lays the 
gromdwork and sets the mood for 
F.ncb Kia. The sound is very 
close to that of Fleetwood Mac 
before the ascent of stevie Nlclal 
and Lindsey Buckingbam. A 
musician who bas undergone 
several musical changes rl late, 
Welch appears to be trying to 
regain the touch that brought him a 
certain amoWlt of acclaim with 
F1eetwood Mac. "Sentimental 
Lady" has thoIIe touches, in ad-
dition to some excellent Olrlstlne 
McVie vocals. 

French KiI. is a very fine album, 
one which brings Welch back full 
circle from his earUer straying. 
After leaving F1eetwood Mac, 
Welch fonned Paris, a hard-rock 
trio which bad troubles from the 
outset. After two albums, four 
managers and a measure of 
trawna, Welch was ready to call it 
quits with the stylish hard-rock 
approach. His current status as a 

1010 artist Ihould bIouom, for

Ronnie Lane (MCA) 

A long time has paued since aD 
the tcHIo over the movie versloo of 
Tummy. n seems even kqcer 
since the Jut Who album, ... By 
N .. ben was releuecl. But, at 
last, Pete TcnmIbend decided to lit 
down and write some music apia. 
The result is not another Who 
album, but an effort in conJUDCtioo 
with n-SmaD Face Ronnie Lane, 
entitled ROuP Mm. 

ReaP MIs was aptly tlUed. 1be 
music, wrlUen by both TOWDIbend 
and Lane (though there is only one 
shared songwrltlng credit) has a 
rough, gritty sound to it, an ear-
thiness not found in The Who's 
often overblown productions. At 
best, MIs is an extremely pleasant 
LP to listen to, complete with a 
simple yet solid beat and some One 
acoustic guitar work. ToWlUlbend's 
versatlllty is the mUlical showcase 
in the album, though the easy, laid-
back warmth Lane contributes 
should not be mlnlmlzed when 
adding up the album's plusses. 

Albums like ReaP Mix are 
interesting to listen to. The music 
will probably never reach tbe ears 
of a concert goer, ooi' will the 
Townshend-Lane collaboration 
lead to a break~ of The Who. But 
when listening to the opening track 
of MIs ("My Baby Gives It 
Away"), I iUlt can't help but smne. 
Music can be infectious and grab 
you without blowing you away. 
Rough Mix lends credence to the 
old adage that good things do come 
in small pa~kages.

Perfection 
(ZNS) A biology professor at the 

California Institlte of Tecbnology 
predicts that hwnan reproduction 
may soon be replaced by genetic 
engineering. 

Doctor James Bonner says tbat 
recem laboratory treakthrougbs 
which enable scientists to 
recombine D.N.A. molecules have 
moved us into the age of using 
genetic perfection. 

Doctor Bonner is quoted by 
MoCber JonH Magazine as saying 
that with limitations being placed 
on the number of children in a 
family, (quote) "There is a moral 
obligation to see that these 
children are free of genetic 
defects."

According to the biologist, 
humans have attempted to 
genetically perfect their plants and 
animals, and the next logical step 
is the genetic perfection of 
hwnans. 

How could this be done? Doctor 
Bomer writes; "OIle 
suggestion has been to remove 
genetic material from each in-
dividual inunediate1y after birth 
and then promptly sterilize tbat 
individual. During the individual's 
lifetime, records would be kept of 
accomplishments and charac-
teri.'ltics. "

Vocal authority Large to 
perform in the Mandeville 

The UCSD Music Department's 
vocal amhority John Larp (bass-
baritone) will present a "fugram 
on October 15 In the Mandeville 
Center, Room 8210, at 8 p,m. 
Uirge's program will be a per-
formance of the work that many 
musicians and music-lovers 

Jellll LarKe 
consider to be the greatest song 
cycle ever written : Sc.hubert's 

" Die Winterreise." 
Large is not only an ac-

complished interpreter of lieder; 
he is a singing-actor, teacher, 
choral conductor, opera director, 
lecturer, scholar, researcher and 
administrator as well. The New 
York Herald TriblDle praised him 
as a musician of " innate 
refmement and sensitivity." 

Uirge 's equally distinguished 
collaborator will be pianist 
Howard Wells. Wells , a frequent 
soloist with the San Diego Sym· 
phony summer concerts, has been 
equally in demand as accompanist 
for s uch stars as Jan Pierce , Mary 
Costa , John Darrenkamp, 
Elizabeth Schwarzkopf and Nicolai 
Gedda . The London Times was 
impressed with the " warm· 
hearted, generous style of his 
playing" of romantic repertory. 

This perfonnance of Schubert's 
lyrical masterpiece is an event 
that no music lover will want to 
miss - a rare opportunity to hear 
one of the pivotal works of the 
early Romantic period. 

The concert is free of charge.

Why tomorrowS professionals 

choose Hewlett-PackardS first family 
of advanced calculators ~ 

They're proven performers. In space. On Everest. In the 
labs of Nobel laureates. Since we built the first, back in 
1972, our advanced calculators have been tested by mil-
lions worldwide, and they've passed. 

They have staying power. Todays classroom prob-
lems quickly grow into tomorrow's on-the-job problems. 
HP calculators are designed and built to handle both. 
They're investments in a future that happens fast. 

They're straightforward. "Advanced" doesn't mean 
"complicated:' It means "uncomplicated:' HP calculators are , 
above all, straightforward . . 

They're easy to use. HP calculators not only grow 
with you; they grow on you. They feel natural, comfortable, 
because we designed them to work like you think. 

They're efficient. HP calculators take the direct 
approach. All feature RPN,. a time-saving, parenthesis-free 
logic system. AU programmables feature a memory-saving 
keycode merging capability. 

They're personal. Professionals design their own ways 
to solve their particular problems, and they expect their 
calculators to be versatile enough to accommodate them. 
Ours are. 

There's a variety. To say we offer a full line is an 
understatement. We offer a choice. That's why we publish

Narcotics CODDection 
Authorities believe that gam-

bling and extortion still provide 
most of the cash for young Chinese 
gangs. New York's Chinatown 
gambling houses handle up to $3 
million a week, according to police 
sources. But there Is growing 
alarm that a major Chinese nar-
cotics network Is also forming. 

Evidence of this - in addition to 
the large cash Dow and the cross-
country mobility of the organizers . 
- includes tbe fonowing develop-
ments : a steady depletion of 
Mexican heroin stocks as the 
primary source for the narcotics 
black market in the U.S.; fears 
that the vacuum created by the 
collapse of tbe Mexican market 
will be filled by Southeast Asian 
opium grown in the "Golden 
Triangle" ( Burma-Laos-
Thailand), dominated for decades 
by OIinese syndicates ; concern 
that the Southeast Asian con-
nection that has flooded Western 
Europe with beroin for the past 
five years Is beginning to stretch 
across the AUantic to America, 
replacing the old "French Con-
nection." 

Just eight months ago, for 
example, 80 to 90 per cent of the 
heroin in the Seattle area came 
from Mexico. But now, about half 
the black market supply is 
believed to consist of high quality 
Southeast Asian heroin. Across the 
border, Inspector Lyman Henschel 
of the Royal Canadian MOlDlted 
Police (Canada's FBI) says that 
Southeast Asia has been Van-
couver's primary heroin source for 
two years. 

Several wealthy crime figures 
have reportedly fled from Hong

The effects of the Bakke decision 
have begun to reverberate 
throughout the California 
educational system. 

A privately funded scholarship 
program for minority engineering 
students has been discontinued by 
the California State University and 
Colleges because the system's 
legal staff felt the program to be 
unconstitutional: 

The reasoning behind that 
judgement fonows that of the 
decision handed down by the 
california Supreme Court in the 
Bakke case. The decision declared 
unconstitutional a UC Davis 
Medical School affirmative action 
program because it considered 
race as a factor . According to the 
court, this violates the equal 
protection article of the U.S. 
constitution . The University of 
California has appealed the 
decision to the United States 
Supreme Court and it will be heard 
on Oct. 12. 

Mayer Chapman , general 
counsel for the state colleges, said 
the Bakke decision was not the 
cause of the decision and cited 
other decisions and legal 

Sigtna Kappa 

precedents that uphold the state's 
position. 

The National Food for Minority 
Engineering Students supports the 
program. The fund is based in New 
York City and is supported by 
contributions fcom corporations 
and fOWidations. 

"First to discontinue" 
Garvey Clarke, president of the 

fund , said the California state 
college system is the first to 
discontinue the program. He added 
that the University of California is 
planning to add the program to 
some of its campuses. Clarke 
hopes to continue aiding state 
college students by going through a 
private foundation to award the 
money. He is currenUy trying to 
work through a private foundation 
in Berkeley so the fund can con-
tinue giving aid at the four state 
colleges in the area. 

Lee Marks, an attorney for the 
fund, said that if the California 
system discontinues the program 
there will be many other In-
stitutions that would be able to use 
the money. He added that the 
california state system could have 
gone on with the program Wltil the 
US Supreme Court ruled af-
firmative action programs un-
constitutional .

By the end of tbia IICbooI year, 
U~D might be able to add a 
second NAJA National tiUe to its 
credit with the 1977-71 Triton 
surfinl team. (The llrst was in 
volleyball In 1971.) , 

For the Drst time, college surfing 
will be a part of the NCAA; with a 
returning squad whlcb finished a 
very close sec:ond in the Western 
Intercollegiate 0uunpj01l8bipll a 
year ago, the Triton team Is in a 
very promising position. 

One of the returning swiers, 
Clark QuIn, will assume the role of 
head coach this season. He will be 
taking the reins from Mike Shand 
who, after completing his doc-
.torate in linguistics at UCSD, has 
accepted a teaching post In Puerto 
Rico. QuIn, a three-year veteran 
for U~D and president of last 
year's surfing club, is well 
qualified for his new position. Even 
though he only started coaching 
the team last Wednesday, QuIn is 
well organized and confident of his 
teain's chances this season. "We 
have a really well rounded team," 
stated QuIn, "with a lot of depth ...

QuIn, Harbor College, Golden West 
and the ever powerlul UC Sama 
Barbara pose the greatest threat to 
an Imdefeated seuon. Crosstown 
rival San Diego state has alwaYli 
glven UCSD a challenge; this 
year's meet, which is also the final 
game of the season, should prove to 
be no exception. The Tritons have a 
busy sdledule with at least 10 dual 
meets and a number of In-
vitationals before the Western 
Intercollegiate Championships on 
Jan. 21-29. The Tritons' lint match 
takes place at home (Oceanside) 
on Oct . IS against a team not yet 
announced.

Depth may be the key to this 
year's success as an excellent crop 
of young surfers and at least 12 
members of last year's crew are 
returninl, Including Alex Bravo, 
Alex Bogdenoff, Eric Hanscon and 
three-year letterman Bert Nielson. 
Although the Tritons are loaded 
with talent, one name stands..4Qt 
when it comes to "hot surling": 

fi's taken a long time for college 
surfinl to reach the level of 
organization offered by the NCAA 
The first intercollegiate match 
took place over a decade ago and 
UCSD was a part of that hisIorical 
confrontation. Under the guise of 
the WISe (Western Intercollegiate 
Surfing Cotmcil) for almost 9 
years, organized surfing stagnated 
through -chaos and the casual 
approach used by the council. Two 
years ago when the American 
SurfIng Association took com-
mand, . team surfing on all noD-
professional levels began to boom 
and receive the recognition so long 
denied. With this year's NCAA 
sanctioning, swfing has entered 
Into a new era with UCSD as its 
leading power.

X-Country sends seven 
to crucial All-Cal meet 

by Steve Goaid 
Andy Sldef ri send his top seven 

runners to Riverside tomorrow 
morniDg to compete for UC San 
Diego In the annual AIl-Cal croll 
country meet. The top seven were 
determined by time trials held 
yesterday afternoon, with the 
results unavailble at press time. 
However, Skief noted that his top 
perfonners from last year, senior 
Doug Jackson, junior Jon 
HalperIn, and sophomores Alan 
Bernath and Ron Surret, would 
probably fill four ri the seven 
spots. 

Stroal SbewtD& 
At last week's . initial team 

meeting, twenty runners ex-
pressed a desire to go out for the 
team. According to Skief, this was 
one of the largest turnouts In the 
school's history. Because of the 
team's lack of practice, Skief 
predicts U~D will finish no higher 
than fourth out of four or five 
schools In tomorrow's meet. UC 

Davis is expected to win the team 
overall tiUe, but if UCLA sends a 
team, the Bruins probably will 
take the top spot away from the 
Aggies. 

Upc:omJag SeuoD 
This week's meet will be crucial 

in determining who will be the 
seven Triton runners to run in each 
of the seven scheduled events this 
season, but Sldef cautioned that the 
top seven will not be the same each 
week, because time trials will be 
run during the week to pick that 
week's runners. 

The slate of meets looks like this: 
Oct. I : All-CalatRiverside; Oct. I:

All the way to the playoffs? 
New coach for varsity soccer 
promises an excellent season 

By Steve GHId 
Sper1a EdJIer 

As is the case with four other UC 
San Diego Intercollegiate teams, 
the mens soccer team baa a new 
coach. But unlike those four teams, 
Coach Stuart Hayes is bighly o~ 
tomistic about his squad's lIP' 
coming season, which begins 
tomorrow afternoon at Azuza 
Pacific College. 

Hayes, a 1974 graduate Ii UCSD, 
has most Ii his defense returning 
and several talented newcomers to 
fill the holes In the offense made by 
players lost tograduation. Even 
though the Tritons have no a~ 
parent weak spots in their line-up, 
Hayes said he will run traditional 
offensive and defensive patterm, 
primarily a 4-2-2 set-up with two 
extra players acting as sweeping 
backs, depending on the offensive 
potential of their opponent. 

Strive 10 Perledle. 
By the midway point ri this 

season, Hayes hopes to have 
reached a plateau In coachability 
of his team. At this time, he plans 
to employ the concept Ii "total 
Dutch footbsU" - interchanging 
positions randomly during the 
game, a style of. rifense which 
constanUy puts pressure on the 
opposinl team's defense and 
goalie. However, Hayes noted that 
"he is striving for this and unW 
that time, we'U stay with a 4-2-2, 4-
2-4 or a 1-4-Z.2set-up." 

Last SeMOaI'I'bII Se ... 
Last season, ex-coacb Ilan Roth-

muller lead UCSD to a second 
place finish In the NAIA District 
Three Suther Division, behind 
USIU. The Tritons were then 
eliminated In the opening round of 
the NAJA playoffs by perennial 
power Westmont, 3-1. This season, 
Hayes is counting on at least a 
second place ifnish In league play, 
again behind USIU. 

Hwever, with an abbreviated 
four game league schoedule, one 
upst could keep the Tritons out of 
the playoffs, as only the first two 
teams In the Division qualify for 
post-season play. Hayes is con-
fident, though, that his team will 
defeat Southern California College, 
Pont Loma and Cal Baptist to 
ensure a playoff spot. 

Returnfal Lettermen 
Expected to spearhead UCSO's 

offense this season are sophomore 
forwards Bruce Logan and Greg 
Lyons. Other returnees on offense 
include Russell Crane, Brad 
Carruthers and Mike Schein, a 
senior from Reading, Penn-
sylvania. 

On defense, Hayes is looking for 
the Youngdale twins, Dave and 
Doug, and senior AI Turken to 
protect goalie Brian Healy. Others 
to watch Include freshman Peter 
Matz and Sophomore Jonathan 
Gold, both from Beverly Hills High 
School. 

All.o.I Tounaey 
Highlighting the 1977 schedule is 

the aMual All-Cal Tournament, 
pitting teams from all eight UC 

Triton Times 
needs 

typesetters 

SChOOls In a round-robin on October 
7 and 81n Berkeley. UCLA, wiMer 
of several NCAA soccer tiUes, is 
favored to win the tourney but 
Hayes noted that' UCSD can finish 
as high !is second if they can upset 
second-seeded Cal. 

In the tourney, Hayes' team will 
play Cu~style soccer, a very 
defensive style of game and "go 
out to play the best game 
possible. " 

UCSD plays only 13 games, 
which alUloys Hayes. He pointed 
out that USIU plays 25 contests, 
with trips to three tournaments up 
north while other schools in the 
league play at least 20 games. 

About the New Coach 
While at UCSD, Hayes was a four 

year letterman and earned All-
District Three honors as a senior. 
Mter graduating with a BS in 
psychology, Hayes went to Stan-
ford , where he received an MA In 
Education. He acted as Interim 
varsity coach in 1974, a season 
topped off with a second place 
finish In the All-Cal event .

Black Marllet Henla ,

Corp. recently linked the five ex-
police officers to Vancouver's 
black market heoin trade, bit 
Vancouver detective Scotland says 
he has no "concrete evidence" to 
support that charge, 

" More and more Southeast Asian 
heroin will be seen in this country 
within the next three years" 
because of DEA success in 
eradicating Mexican opium, says 

federal Drug F.i1iorcement 
Administration (DEA) official Joe 
Flanden in Los Angeles. 

F1anden notes that much of the 
Southeast Asian heroin is 
manufactured and supplied by 
organized syndicates with con-
nections in Hong Kong, Bangkok 
and Europe. Flanders believes the 
syndicates also have strong con-
nections in the U.S., partially 
beca use of ethnic ties to Asian 
communities here. 

On the East Coast, authorities 
suspect that Olinese syndicates 
are beginning to negotiate with 
established U.S. Mafia figures. 

" We do not see the gang ldd<! 
handling the narcotic itself - yet," 
says New York detective 
Mauriello, whose precinct includes

shampoo must contain NUCLEOPROTEINS DNA and RNA. These 
essential building blocks in the polypeptid~ chain repair damaged protein 
in the same ratio from which it is naturally depleted from the hair!! A full 
complement of amino acids, vitamins, minerals, enzymes and coen-
zymes hydrolized to the correct size and weight penetrate the hair shaft 
and are utilized by the NUCLEOPROTEINS to reconstruct hair damage.

Mafia hook-up." 

ElU'Ope baa been flooded with 
Southeast Asian herpin since 1972, 
after the Turkish government 
agreed to halt opium harvesting in 
that country, Authorities In 
Amsterdam and loodon believe 
that Chinese syndicates called 
" Triads" are responsible for 
transporting most of Europe's 
black market heroin supply from 
Hong Kong and Bangkok, and are 
recruiting young Hong Kong im-
migrants as dope runners and 
enforcers, Both Amsterdam and 
London have experienced blood-
shed among young Chinese who 
are apparently caught up in 
territorial feuds between Triad 
leaders. 

Heroin - No Major Role 
Although San Francisco police 

contend that heroin trafficking 
" had no major role " in recent 
Olinatown violence, other sources 
- including some in local gover-
runent - believe large quantities of 
Southeast Asian heroin are pouring 
into San Francisco but are being 
distributed elsewhere. 

DEA officials in Los Angeles 
have apprehended about 10 
Chinese immigrants from 
Thailand in the past year on 
narcotics charges. About a dozen 
Chinese are also awaiting trial in 
Vancouver on heroin charges. 

Despite current police efforts to 
get at the root of Chinese organized 
crime, some Chinatown critics 
contend it may be too little too late. 

" Unlike police counterparts in 
Hong Kong and Singapore, who 
have penetrated the underworld 
organizations, San Francisco 
police are still relying on secon-
dary sources for most of their 
infonnation ... Not only that, it is 
common knowledge in Chinatown 
that many so-<:alled community 
leaders have links with the un-
derworld. If the police and city 
officials prefer to deal .with these 
community leaders, the common 
folks will never voluntarily 
testify."
