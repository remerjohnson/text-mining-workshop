DAVIS - Next month, a poup 
of UC Davis mechanical 
engineering students will

TIle car, nicknamed "After-
shock," is equipped with both 
an electric motor and a gasoline 
engine, and has almady

Widow Gives $20 Million to UCSD Library 
DONAnON: Audrey 
Geisel's gift is the 
largest in school history 
By Terry Lew 
Associate News Editor 

Audrey Geisel, wife of the late 
1beodor "Dr. Seuss" Geisel, has 
promised the UCSD LJbraries an 
unrestricted endowment of an esti-
mated 520 million. 

"Audrey and Ted Geisel shared a 
love of learning, of words spoken 
and wrilfen, of ideas and of books," 

UCSDChancelior Richard Atkinson 
said. "This gift is a wonderful and 
fiUins testimony to their spirit." 

The university announced the 
gift, believed to be the largest single 
donation in the city of San Diego's 
history, on Monday. At Geisel's re-
quest, the exact amount of the gift 
was withheld. 

According to University librar-
ian Gerald Lowell, the University 
Library will be renamed the Geisel 
Library in late November or early 
December. This gesture was ex-
tended "to recognize [Geisel's] gift, 

to thank her, and to honor both her 
and her husband." , ' 

Geisel's gift, a combination of 
an immediate donation and a com-
mitment to future contributions, will 
become a part of the library's en-
dowment. 

The money will be invested by 
the UCSD Foundation, the fund-
raising arm of the university, whic:h 
will periodically distribute a per-
centage of the interest to the library . 
The remainder of the interest wiu be 
added to' the principal, which will 
continue to grow. 

The library currently receives 
about 4.5 pereent of the interest on its 
$4.9 million endowment, Lowell said. 

The gift is unrestricted, meaning 
that the library can use the proceeds 
u it chooses. Lowell said efforts 
would center on increasing patrons' 
access to information - both print 
and electronic - and on teaching 
undergraduates how to access and 
use that information. 

"The UCSD Library is so right 
for Ted," Geisel said. "First, be-
cause literacy has always been our

AN AMERICAN JOURNEY Police Deny 
Second Claim 
Of Harassment 
FOu.oW-UP: Another woman 
alleges harassment in the 
UCSD police department 
By Tedd LIIdd 
Senior St6ff Writer 

Amid tbe recent harassment claims raised by 
a former UCSD police dispatcher apinst her 
supervisor, Luis Santaella, another ex-police 
department employee came forward earlier this 
week with allegations against the same man. 

The woman, who wished to remain anony-
mous, was not employed as a dispatcher under 
Santaella. However, she said Santaella "made 
every woman [in the department] feel uncom-
foruble," and that he "was constantly looking 
down ... at my breasts." 

Santaella maintains that he has never ha-
rassed anyone, and that he has "retained a law-
yer" with the possibility of initiating "defama-
tion charges" against the unnamed sources. 

"Other than to clarify, I've been advised [by 
my lawyer] not to say anything," Santaellasaid. 

The ex-employee also mentioned that there 
had been "several prior incidents" of harass-
ment on the part of Santaella, and that they were 
written down in the UCSD Police Department's 
Daily Activity Record (DAR).

A.S. Discusses Oklahoma City Plaque and Sun God Funding 
MEmNG: Council 
convenes for the first 
time this year 
.yarHeJ .... 
Guardian Reporter 
, The ASUCSD Council held its 
first meeting of the year yester-
day, discussing matters concern-
ing the Oklahoma City bombing, 
the Library Walk, the A.S. execu-
tive budget and now-defunct af-
firmative-action policies. 

To begin business, the A.S. pro-
posed to place a commemorative 

plaque on the Library Walk for 
victims of the Aug. 19 Oklahoma 
City bombing, but the Advisory 
Committee opposed the plan. 

According to Muir Freshman 
Senator Leeor Alpern, the Advi-
sory Committee said the plaque 
was a "nice gesture, but not im-
portant to UCSD, UC or Califor-
nia." 

The committee suggested an 
alternative commemorative item, 
such as a book for the University 
Library. 

"The administration says that 
the [Library] Walk belongs to the 

students, but they are not letting 
them do what they want with it," 
said A.S. Vice President of Fi-
nance Edmondo Robinson. 

"The cost of the plaque is nomi-
nal. It is just a form of student 
spirit and emotion, but the [Advi-
sory Committee] is shutting it 
down. They're being bureau-
cratic," he added. 

The A.S. said it would discuss 
the matter again before taking any 
further action. 

In other business, the A.S. al-
located 510,000 to the Sun God 
Festival Committee, in addition 

to the annual 520,000 the Commit-
tee receives from the executive 
budget. 

According to Vice President 
Administrative Jennifer Nicoll, 
the Sun God Festival held lut 
May cost $48,000 - 530,000 
more than the committee had ex-
pected to pay. 

"The Sun God Festival Com-
mittee had to pay extra for secu-
rity and fences [because] it was 
relocated to the Warren Man," 
Nicoll said. "We gave them

ture and classical theater. She was also praised for her 
work in the education and promotion of Greece, and 
her support for the Thesaurus of the Greek Language 
- a computerized treasury of the Greek language.

Atkinson Now Has a Job 
Which FIts His Quallftcatlons 

I " 

Congratulations to Chancellor Atkinson on securing the( 
position of president of the University of California. We 
wholeheartedly believe that, despite their initial hesitation, 
the regents selected the best man for the job. As president, 
Atkinson will deal with all aspects of the large, bureaucratic 
university syster,t - all aspects, that is, except the one 
which really counts: the students. 

Students at UCSD will fondly remember Atkinson as the 
chancellor they never saw, never heard and never knew, 
except in name. Unlike Chancellors Charles Young of 
UClA and Chang-Lin Tien of Berkeley - who make it a 
point to interact with students on a regular basis -
Atkinson rarely ever conversed with the people who truly 
make the university a school. 

He could, however, bring in .money. Between securing 
million-dollar grants from the federal government, increas-
ing the number of faculty members who are Nobel laureates 
and National Science Foundation fellows, and spurring the 
growth of La Jolla's "Golden Triangle"'area, Atkinson 
proved he has what it takes to "run" the financially dire UC. 

The regents have made money a priority over opening the ' 
doors to affordable education - and communicating with

No More Hijack Journalism 
After much debate, the Washington Post decided to print 

the Unabomber's 35,OOO-word essay, "Industrial Society 
and Its Future." The Unabomber said he would stop send~ng 
bombs and killing people if a major newspaper printed his 
"manifesto." Unfortunately, the Post fell right into a 
madman's trap. 

At first glance, printing the essay seems like a good idea. 
After all, the killer promised he would mend his ways if 
only the public had the opportunity to see the world through 
his eyes - or rather through his verbose explanation of the 
world through his eyes. 

However, upon taking a closer look, it becomes obvious 
that the situation is a Catch 22: There is no guarantee that 
the Unabomber will keep his word, and who can predict the 
actions of a madman? He can strike at any time, no matter 
what was previously said. 

But the dilemma goes further than trust. Printing the entire 
essay would not only let the general public know how the 
Unabomber sees things, but it would also give other maniacs 
an opportunity to copy his print~this-or-people-die method of 
capturing'the media's - and the public's - attention. 

The Unabomber has, in essence, taken hostage of the 
press with his threats. He has already killed thr~e people and 
injured many others. The press cannot afford to take the 
word of a murderer. And yet, it already has. 

Many psychopaths may have already read the 
Unabomber's essay by now, with something more than 
mere curiosity. And if any ,of these lunatics decides to 
follow in the Unabomber's footsteps, it would not be 
without the help of the Washington Post, which took upon 
itself to spread the word of a madman.

THE 0.1. CASE: 
FACf OR FICTION? 

COMMENTARY: The "Trial of the Century," with all the makings for 
a movie, is actually the latest in Hollywood entertainment 

o ere k

HOFTEN 
The Voice of 

. Rea.son 

They almost had me. I al-
most bought it. But I Caught on 
just in time. Maybe it was when 
Judge Ito cried on the bench af-
ter a star witness insulted his 
wife. Or maybe it was when Ito 
let O.J. stand up in the middle 
of the proceedings and demand 
an end to the trial. Maybe that 
was when I realized that the 
O.J. trial isn't really a trial at 
all. 

No, it's all 
an act; an act 
put together by 
Hollywood ex-
ecutives, an i n-

genious new form of show business 
called "Virtual Entertainment," where 
the public has no idea whether the 
events taking place are real or simply 
an act. 

in our country. This was Hollywood's chance to prove 
,to the American public that the entertainment industry 
did not push its sinful agenda on the innocent people 
of America. 

Rather, the O.J. trial would show that Hollywood 
merely represented society in an accurate manner. So 
if the public were to buy the O.J. trial as legitimate, 
what could Hollywood possibly produce tbat would 
be more outlandish or offensive? Truth would indeed 
be more vile than fiction. 

And so the adventure began. All it really required 
, was sufficient capital to buy off the 

proper people. In order to guarantee 
sufficient revenue, the network execu-
tives were the first people to be con-
tacted. They could be bought for any 
price, and television advertising would 
fund the project. The trial promised 
incredible publicity which would pro-
vide enough incentive for the TV mo-
guls to play along. 

Amazingly, eVen most of the' 
people involved in the production have 
no idea that it's a'production at all-
they innocently believe that it's a real-
life experience. Only a select few ac-
tually know they're acting - and 
helping to launch the 21st century's 

, brand of entertainment, the most mas-
sive, dangerous and efficient money-
making enterprise in history. But they 
couldn't fool me; I saw through their 
scheme. And since they didn't ask me 
to star in the production, I'll take the 
liberty of exposing their charade, of 
alerting the public to tbis gross ma-
nipulation of power. Allow me to ex-
plain. 

The masterminds bebind tbis en-

Mind you, the actual news report-
ers remained ignorant of the entire af-
fair. They simply reported what they 
believed to be legitimate news. The 
sensationalism of the trial would gen-
erate enough advertising revenue to 
pay both the TV stations and Holly-
Wood. Beyond TV, however, massive 
revenue would also result from the 
trial's free self-promotion. The public 
would be so entbralled with the daily 
events of the trial that numerous fledg-
ling businesses and marketing endeav-
ors would arise: 0.1. board games, fake 
Ito beards and "Free O.J'" bumper 
stickers. Los Angeles' tourism would 
skyrocket; every news medium in the 
world would set up camp outside tbe 
courtroom, while millions of people 

deavor are primarily HolIYl¥ood executives. After suf-
fering tbrough several years of declining revenues and 
reviews, of pressure from botb tbe political left and 
righi to curb the amount of violence and sex in their 
productions, these Hollywood executives decided to 
strike back. No longer would their productions be sub-
ject to scrutiny by Tipper Gore or Pat Buchanan. No 
longer would the American public be able to blame 
Hollywood for perpetuating the breakdown of morals 

from aU parts of the globe would come to visit Bundy 
and Rockingham. 

This free promotion and its potential profit also 
served as extra incentive for the network executives. 
People would spend endless hours watching TV, far 
beyond simple trial coverage. How many of you tuned

Show, or turned on Hard Copy to see actual footage of

The academic left intends to in-
doctrinate and drive this campus-
and others - to its relativistic, 
amoral and multicultural roots. If 
you are Catholic, Baptist, Anglican, 
male or - worst of all-white, the 
rhetoric of the politically correct 
(PC) should settle somewhere be-
tween Orwellian and laughable. 

The PC revisionists' ultimate 
goal - to destroy all vestiges of 
faitb and public expression of one's 
belief in a higher power - would 
prove alienating and oppressive to 
many groups. The battle cry of the 
academic left, judging from its in-
cessant rhetoric, is, "We will not 
tolerate intolerance!" 

The most unsettling aspect of its 
effort to purge our nation of the 

scourge of religious thought is its 
hypocritical and relentless persecu-
tion of Christians. Using the 
premise that the most flamboyant 
and offensive media caricatures of 
Christianity accurately represent 
what Christians believe, the PC re-
visionists make the sweeping proc-
lamation that those who call them-
selves Christians are actually re-
sponsible for the trouble tbis nation 
faces. 

If Christianity were an obstruc-
tion to social stability, this nation 
would have fallen years ago. The PC 
Gestapo does not accept Christian-
ity as a belief in a higher power, but 
as a set of actions to be challenged 
- and defeated - in courts of law:

accept the PC, Gestapo's definition

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Thursday, September 28,1995 

COMMENTARY: A survey of the past season's various media reveals a 
cornucopia of easily forgotten news blurbs, movies, commercials and music 

ONE SENSEI lESS SUMMER 
By F ...... SIuIdIIb 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Last summer I went to New York 
City, where I was far away from 
school, suburbia and family - and 
knee-deep in urbanity, an internship 
and the biggest mass of people this 
land has seen. Contrary to public 
opiniori, New York is not the pin-
nacle of western civilization. In fact, 
it embodies and even attempts to 
glorify what defines the Third 
World: a population density which 
no rational person should ever have 
to endure. Gelling lost in the sea of 
people, my summer excitement in-
cluded the media's spew of more 
pseudo-events and disasters than 
I'vc evcr had the pleasure oftrying 
to forget. 

My fun started at the airport, en 
route to the Big Apple, where I wit-
nessed the havoc that one modern-
day Luddite - armed with stealthy 
explosives, a trite manifesto and the 
efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service 
- can wreak. With the publication 
of the Unabomber's statement now 
underway in a number of papers, 
and his 15 minutes of fame allot-
ted, tbe question tbat remains is: 
How many more minutes will this 
'-cgrown terrorist want?

ing if he was gratefully dead or not. 
My fingers are still crossed, hoping 
that the ranks of deadheads who in-
fest this great land of ours will, out 
of sheer confusion and lack of di-
rection, disperse and disappear. 

But somehow, I doubt it will hap- -
pen. 

And with respect to that young, 
fellatio-soliciting, British actor, I 
wonder: Hugh really cares? Why, in 
the context of the Hollywood social-
ite culture, did this blip of an event 
register as July's biggest story? A 
textbook case of arbitrary media 
sensationalism, I suppose. 
nred of the Hype 

As far as summer of '95 pseudo-
events went, there was no shortage 
or decline in their scale or grllIdeur. 
The middle of August brought us the 
height of the Windows '95 ad cam-
paign, and the countdown to execu-
tion for convicted murderer Mumia 
Abu Jamal. For Microsoft, it was the 
anticipation of the August 24th re-
lease date; for Mumia it was "Will 
there be a release date?"

had our own share of national head-
line-making news. The UC repeal ' 
of a many decade-old affirmative-
action policy broke the front page 
of the New York 1imes. From New 
York, I gleefully rejoiced at what I 
saw as the first severe blow to af-
firmative inaction since its institu-
tion. It will now likely be a battle 
of attrition against the pro-discrimi-
nation coalitions, that will fight 
tooth and nail to maintain the ex-
plicitly racist doctrine. 

The decision to hold the regents' 
meeting on affirmative action while 
school was out of session was as 
strategic as it was ingenious. I shud-
der to think of all the annoyance we 
would have had to put up with on 
campus had the decision come at 
any point during the school year. 
Kudos to whomever was respon-
sible for the arrangement. 

In another bit of multicultural 
fun, UCSD's own Voz Frontierizo 
garnered national attention wben the 
federal powers discovered that a 
publication from a public university 
was calling for the murder of fed-
eral immigration officers (tbat's 
migra pigs to you). Threats to re-
peal federal or state funding from 
UCSD, however, diminished when 
it W8S learned that ~, along with 
all the altenaative media at UCSD, 
is lOIely fuaded by the toaJly non-
federal Almciated Students (that'. 
junior bureac:rats to you). 

Thedililtpauolll aaIi~ 
.em ,.auriq of thaM bad boyl 

at Voz did, however, help contrib-
ute to placing UCSD on tbe map. 
In fact, it was in the national spot-
light for much of tbe summer. The 
Voz hubbub was the biggest thing 
to happen here since M1V came for 
Spring Break. Those boys should be 
thanked for all the free publicity 
they won for UCSD. 

. Because of'Voz, UCSD is now 
not only home to Sally Ride, six 
Nobel Prize laureates and the 
Church lands, but we are also the 
proud center of the unofficial U.S. 
headquarters of La RaZ4. 
The Orey Screen 

And the media event which cap-
sized them all must have been Kevin 
Costner's Waterworld - the only 
film in history upon which the fu-
ture of the entire U.S. economy was 
dependent. Its antithesis, Larry 
Clark's Kids, was the only film in 
history upon which the future of par-
enH::hild relationships was depen-
dent. The far-out extremity of Kids 
had parents all over the country 
searching through their children's 
sock drawers in search of whatever 
psycho-reactive substances are this 
genel1ltion's fancy. Larry Clark's 
cautionary tale for the '90s made a 
handful of misfits and teenage mis-
anthropes the workina archetypes of 
everyone aged 12 to 20.

Editor: 
Kathleen Lytle's screechy com-

mentary last week ("Bluting the 
Bible Thumping Buffoons," Sept. 
19) presents many contrary argu-
ments which give the reader mental 
whiplash. Consider the following 
excerpt: 

"Christianity's embracers have 
used the Bible to their advantage for 
centuries. The persecution of the 
Jews had been defended by th~ 
rhetoric of protecting Christianity. 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. used 
moral shame rooted in Christian 
principles to drive the Civil Rights 
Movement. Slave masters used 
Christian principles as the primary 
justification for slavery. With 20120 
hindsight, we are able to see the ab-
surdity of these arguments and the 
best way to correct the past is to 

The UCSD Guardian 

avoid repeating the same mistakes. " 
Okay, so Christian principles 

used in politics are bad because 1) 
people used them to justify the per-
secution of the Jews, b) Dr. King 
used tbem to show that blacks de-
serve equal rights, and c) slave own-
ers used them to justify slavery. 

Are we to suppose that lbe Civil 
Rights Movement was an evil on an 
equal level witb the persecution of 
tbe Jews and. the slavery of blacks? 
Or baa Cbristian morality, infused 
into politics and social action, in fact 
had beneficial effects on our society?

Aside from network executives, 
a few power people in L.A. needed

the funds and the influence to buy 
anyone. The Chief of Police was 
first. With him in on the production, 
the entire Los Angeles Police De-

the reputation of L.A. cops couldn't 
get any worse; what did they have 
to lose once they exposed their

The local coroner was perhaps 
the most important component of the 
project. As long as he could verify 
the dead bodies of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ro!! Goldman, then the 
public would never question their 
deaths. All the while, Brown and 
Goldman would be vacationing in 
the Caribbean with their cut of the 
profits, while their poor parents 
grieve their passing. Won't the par-
ents be surprised to see their chil-
dren return when the trial ends! As 
for the actual bodies at the crime 
scene, we've all seen what modem 
technology can simulate. After all, 
didn'l we just see Tom Hanks shak-
ing hands with JFK? 

Of course, O.J. is in on the cha-
rade as well. It's all part of his as-

the perfect selection for Hollywood. 

the very disturbing success of 
alterna-sweethearts Hootie " the 
Blowfish. It's that sort of popular-
ity that makes me wonder how far 
the buman race has reaDy come. 

Also, our own Cbancellor 
Atkinson managed to transcend the 
status of lowly university chancel-
lor, and landed himself a cushy job 
(just barely) as UC president. From 
heackJfthc National Science Foun-

The UCSD Guardian 

He compriaea virtually all of the al-
luring aacI intriguiDa qualities Ihat 
soducc the American viewer: He's 
an actor, a sports celebrity, hand-
some and black. 

Naturally, Hollywood chose to 
buy O.J.'s attorneys as well. They 
certainly had nothing to lose as far 
as damaging the reputation of law-
yers. And &his way they actually 
spiced things up a little by dictating 
Ihe proceedings. Every time you 
saw Robert Shapiro antagonizing 
Marcia Clark with vicious verbal 
exchanges, Shapiro had orches-
trated the whole thing, just to make 
the trial more sensational. And poor 
Clark actually thought that she was 
prosecuting a murderer. Ever notice 
how she was always the most seri-
ous one in the courtroom? 

Aside from this short list of ac-
tors, none of the participants was in 
on it. They all thought it was real: 
the jury, the rest of the witnesses, 

dation to becoming UCSD chancel-
lor to becoming UC president; what 
a long, strange trip it's been. 

ADd, in the country with the 
largest gathering of people, we got 
to see the largest gathering of femi-
ninity since Wigstock, as the much-
touted Hillary rubbed elbows with 
the elite non-elite: a worldwide 
cross-section of women's leaders. 
Now if all the women at the 1995 

tile entire prosecution and District 
Attorney, tile American public ... 

With the proper peoplo dic:tat-
ing tile proceedings, Hollywood 
could write its own outlandish script 
and incorporate any hot social is-
sue it wanted; and it did just that. 
What masterful manipulation of 
race relations, spousal abuse, mixed 

. o:wriage, murdcr,lCx, love, perjury, 
the legal system and media relations 
- all the things that galvanize the 
public interest. 

But that's where they tipped me 
off. That's where those snooty Hol-
lywood executives went too far: 
They overloaded the script. Per-
haps, for the average American 
citizen, it all made sense. Perhaps 
they saw nothing odd about the 
freeway chase and 300 cops fol-
lowing a fugitive and double-mur-
der suspect back to his own house 
at a leisurely 35 miles per hour. 
Nothing odd about O.J. carrying a 

World Women's Conference 
jumped off their chairs at the same 
time, what would happen? 

More summer fun worth men-
tioning: ~lvin Klein launched a 
national ad campaign for the North 
American Man/Boy Love Associa-
tion, the Public Broadcasting Sys-
tem crowed about its federal fund-
ing status, and Ayn Rand got main-
stream attention with a feature ar-

Thunday, September 28,I99S 

gun, passport and fake beard in his 
getaway car. 

Perhaps it &cemed normal to 
most people to ICC the likes of Rosa 
Lopez, Mark Fuhrman and Kato 
Kaelin on the stand. (Don't forget, 
Kaelin is an aspiring actor, too!) 
Perhaps the American public 
glossed right over a judge sobbing 
openly during his own trial because 
someone called his wife a name. 
And perhaps they saw nothing bi-
zarre about a double-murder defen-
dant standing up and having his say, 
demanding that his own trial come 
to an end. 

Well, not me. I bought into the 
chase. They sold me on Kato Kaelin. 
But Ito lost it for them. He tipped 
me off. At first I doubted my own 
theory. After all, spousal abuse, race 
relations and murder are pretty se-
rious issues to manipulate for a 
simple profit. But who better to do 
so than Hollywood? 

ticle about berself in the New 
Yorker, as well as a Newsweek re-
port thaI Oliver Stone has plans to 
make The Fountainhead into a 
film. 

And soon ... 
Judging by the utter lack of any-

thing remotely worth remembering, 
it 's safe to assume that Last summer 
will soon pass into oblivion, just as 
soon as O.J. 's aquitted.

All ....... : UCSD Police Department 
faces two claims of harassment 

The UCSD Guardian 

DENIAL: UCSD 
police maintain innocence 
in harassment matter 
ContInued froIn ..... 1 
ceming harassment of an employee." 

"Both those cues involve [Santaella].-
the ex-employee said. 

However, UCSD Assistant Chief of Po-
lice Jay Dyer said tbe reports "have nothing 
to do with [Santaella]. II 

And although tbe police would not re-
lease the names of tbe people in the reports, 
Dyer said that the Police Department "has a 
good history of terminating people if tbey 
don't play by the rules. What I can tell you 
is ... [Santaella] has not been disciplined for 
harassment. " 

When asked why tbe same allegations 
came from two different women, Dyer said 
that it was because Santaella is "a strong 

supervisor, and [he doesn't] let people get 
away with miaMhaviors." 

"[Santaella] is not here because he's a 
nice guy. He's here because he does a pretty 
good job, II Dyer added. 

The harassment claims against Santaella 
stem from an Equal Employment Opportu-
nity Commission (EEOC) complaint report 
filed July 7 by a dispatcher, who was fired 
from the department on June 30. 

In the EEOC report, the dispatcher al-
leges -among other things - that Sanllella 
"intimidated" and "sexually barassed" ber, 
and that "many females have complained of 
sexual harassment, [but] no action has been 
taken." 

"Accusations that are brought to this 
department are fully investigated," Dyer 
said. "If a problem occurs, we launch a 
supervisory investigation. If a crime has 
occured, a criminal investigation is 
launched." 

TbUllday, September 28,1995 

In an article in the GlUJrdiIUI on Sept. 19, 
the dispatcher said she was hawsed from 
"day one.- and that she took the mailer 
through the chain of command, but nothing 
was done about the harassment claims. 

Santaella responded to her statements 
again yesterday, saying "I was on vacation 
during the first month of her employment, 
so it couldn't have been 'since day one. ,It 

He also said the former dispatcher "never 
pursued her claims through the chain of 
command," only coming forward on the 
last day when she knew she would be fired. 

As far as the specific allegations against 
him are concerned, Santa ella said, "This 
country's based on innocence, until proven 
guilty."

WOMEN: 
Conference has its 
own inequalities 
ContInued from .,..e 2 
adultery," Flkhrabldi said. 

"We wanted to make women 
aWlre of the horrolli which are a 
common practice in some middle-
eastern countries," she added. 

Huiza, a Ph.D. candidate in the 
Depanment of Literature, said her 
primary goal WIS to record the 
progress made since the last forum, 
which l\ad been held in Nairobi, 
Kenya, in 1985. 

". wanted to document the ruc-
tion of women It the gathering with 
respect to the achievements that the 
documents of 10 years Igo had es-

tablis~," Huiza said. 
According to Huiza, one of the 

highlights from the forum was her 
opportunity to translate for a group 
of women who could not talk to 
each other because there was a short-
Ige of translators. Originally from 
EI Salvador, Huiza can speak En-
glish and Spanish fluently and was 
Ible to help women from different 
countries communicate. 

Hu iza said there was still a strong 
bond between the women, even 
though they couldn't speak directly 
to each other. 

"Beyond the basic language 
[problem], there was a connection 
between these women which was 
symbolic," she said. 

Fakhrabadi Ilso felt that frus-
trating circumstances did not dim 
the women's enthusiasm to share 
their experiences at the forum. 

"It wu raining all the time, and 
the housing and transportation were, 
at times, realfy bad, but that didn't

stop anyone from panicipating," 
Fakhrabadi said. "We III had the 
same goal - women's rights. We 
wanted to show that if there iren't 
women's rights, there aren't human 
rights." 

Despite the strong bond between 
the women, Nguyen, Huiza and 
Fakhrabadi emphasized that there 
was discrimination present even It a 
conference promoting equality. 

"We stayed in a really luxurious 
hotel, but some women from other 
countries had to stay in awful hous-
ing," said Huiza. 

Nguyen added that "Women 
from non-western countries were 
placed.in bad housing because the 
Chinese organizers knew 'hat west-
ern women would protest if given , 
those terrible conditions." 

The women also felt that cover-
age of the event sought to bury, 
instead of bring out, tbe peninent 
issues discussed It tbe forum and 
the conference, 

While the media chose to focus 

on Hilary Clinton's visit to China, 
and China's slew of human-rights 
violations, Americans were kept 
mostly in the dark about the strides 
being made inside the conference. 

An even bigger discrepancy both-
ering the women was the fact that 
the United Nations had, in past years, 
mainly invited elite women to its 
conferences. 

"This year, the United Nations 
was really being 'held on trial' by 
the women at the forum for its past 
failure to incorporate marginalized 
groups," Nguyen said. 

"The United Nations can say that 
they are representing women, but it 
really clependson how they go about 
it," she added. "If they only repre-
sent one group, tbey lren't repre-
senting women. " 

Though 'they are hopeful that the 
statusofwomen will improve, Nguyen 
and Fakhrabadi said they feel great 
strides stin need ~ be made. 

"We have achieved I lot, but 
taws and poverty still stand in the

way of women," Fakhrabadi said. 
Nguyen Idded that there are 

many Ireas where women still must 
gain ground. 

"We still need to pay women 
equal wages for equal work. We still 
need to make sure women in third-
world countries are not just expon-

ing their goods, but have sustain-
able development. And as far as 
peace is concerned, it is imperative 
to bring women to peace talks. 
Maybe only then will peace be long 
lasting."

MIZUNO: 
Tourney will test SO 
ContInued from .... 28 
rics over UC Riverside and CSU 
Dominguez Hills, are ranked sec-
ond in the region, entering their first 
Division- III action of the season. 

"This tournament is huge for our 
regional rankings for the rest of the 
year," UCSD Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik said. 

The tournament format will re-
quire each team to play four best 
three-of-five-set matches over the 
two days of competition, testing the 
stamina and depth of the banged up 
UCSD squad. 

Starting middle blocker Chris-
tine Chi, who ~as sidelined earlier 
in the year while recovering from 
knee surgery, is nursing the sore 
knee after her big performances 
against Riverside and Dominguez. 

Setter Sherine Ebadi. whose 
play was instrumental in the Tri-
tons' recent successes, is also in-
jured and may not be able to com-
pete in back-to-back games over 
the weekend. Senior outside hitter 
Angelle Crochet will return to 
UCSD's lineup, but only in a back-
row capacity. 

These key injuries would cer-
tainly handicap a lesser team, but, 
fortunately for the Tritons, their 
bench is filled with young talent. 

"Luckily, we have a lot of depth, " 
Dannevik said. "We have 14 strong 
players, and we'll use them all." 

The Triton bench will certainly 
need to make large contributions if 
UCSD hopes to come away as tour-
nament champions. 

Among the teams looking to 
knock-off the Tritons is arch-rival 
- and the west region's number-
one ranked team - California 
Lutheran. Also in attendance will be 
third-ranked UC Santa Cruz and 
number-five Colorado College. 

"Winning is important," 
Dannevik said. "But we still need to 
develop our younger players be- . 
cause, if [Crochet] or [Chi] is hurt in 
November, we will need them to 
carry us through the playoffs." 

PIAN: Seifert 
saved Fontes ... 
ContInued from ..... 28 
the Lions were always there for the 
4gers to trounce. 

Now the Niners have returned 
the favor, allowing Fontes to stick 
around and watch Detroit lose games 
for years to come. 

However, this display of gener-
osity was not just for the Lions' 
benefit. There was additional moti-
vation for allowing the defeat. The 
Ninercoaching staff realize~Jthat its 
team was dispatching opponents 
without even breaking a sweat. 

The squad needed to challenge 
itself, to pretend there is room for 
improvement. By losing to Detroit, 
the team provides itself with that 
illusion. It gives them a reason to get 
fired up, and adds to their intensity. 

In fact, the recent loss reminds 
me of last season. Early on, San 
Francisco was on its way to I perfect 
season, dominating il$ adversaries. 
Then the Philadelphia Eagles came 
to Candlestick and routed the home 
team by forty. 

The Niners retooled, and from 
that point, the team was unstop-
pable and nobody - from Dallas to 
the Chargers - could stop them. 

You see, it'sall part of the master 
plan.

Dou""tNmed: Blake Thompson is attacked by two Crusaders. 

SET BACK: Pt. 
Lorna drops UCSO 
ContInued from ..... 28 
into the far comer of the net. 

"It's been the same pa~m all 
year," UCSD senior fullback Nick 
Terlecky said. "We should have put 
them away early - scored three 
goals right away. After they scored 
the lucky goal, we lost our compo-
sure; that is why we lost the game." 
. The Tritons had numerous 
chances to tie the contest and at one 
point came very close to achieving 
the tying tally. Three minutes after 
the go-ahead goal by Demaree, Nate 
Hetherington came within inches of 
tying the game at two, when his 
flying header off of a crossing pass 
hit the top right part of the goal, 

minutes to put one past Crusader 
netminder Mark Keller, who was 
brought in at the beginning of the 
second half. Keller, who stands at 
six-foot-four inches tall was able to 
snatch many-a-crossing attempt 
from thr air, keeping his team ahead 
by a goal. 

UCSD came close again at the 
80:28 mark. Christopher Fuji was 
awarded a free kick on the left side, 
about 22 yards out, but senior de-
fender K~n Bums' looping kick over 
\be wall of Crusader defeodm hit

SWEENERS

The Tragedy, 
The Pain 

Two inches. Had Doug 
Brien'. field goal attempt on 
Monday night bad been a 
scant two inches to tbe left, 
the 4gers would have averted 
a loss to tbe winless Detroit 
Lions, tbus side-stepping a 
disaster of catastrophic 
proportions. 

Instead, Mr. Brien's lame 
kick smacked the upright and 
caromed barmlessly into the 
endzone, tbus granting Wayne 
Fontes and his lowly Lions 
their first victory of the season. 

How ironic that in a game 
of yards, it is two insignificant 
inches that makes the differ-
ence in this improbable win. 

In fact, "improbable" 
doesn't even seem adequate in 
descn"bing this monumental 
travesty. Even "impossible" 
seems inadequate. 

As a result of this incom-
prehensible upset, the very 
laws of nature have been 
plunged illlo chaos - unlikely 
repercussions are running 
rampant. Rivers are flowing 
backwards; the Earth's rotation 
has ceased, and the tides have 
begun 10 change. 

But, undoubtedly, the most 
shocking of all these unnatural 
occ;urrences is the ascendance 
of the Los Angeles Lambs -
turned SI. Louis Rams - .to 
the wp of the NFC's Western 
Division. 

Traditionally the NFL's 
rendition of the Washington 
Genenls, this forlorned Ram 
franchise is now undefeated, 
thanks largely to a schedule 
chock-full of pathetic excuses 
for football teams. The Rams, 
who have long been synony-
mous with mediocre football 
and u~ightly uniforms are in 
first place, above even the 
five-time Super Bowl Cham-
pion Niners. 

To make matters worse, 
San Francisco's bated rivals, 
the Dallas Cowboys, are 4-0 
and cruising toward the 
playoffs on autopilot. To the 
uneducated football nut, the 
situation looks mighty grim for 
the reigning Super Bowl 

.' cbamps. 
But 10 fans in the know, 

like myself, it is obvious that 
this unlikely state of affairs is 
aU part of George Seifert's 
master plan - his grand 
scheme to return the NFL's 
most storied team to eminence 
for the second straight season. 

You see, it would have 
been cruel and inhuman for the 
Niners 10 uUerly smash Detroit 
on national television. Word 
was out thatafler the Lions' 
terrible 0-3 start, Coacb 
Fontes's job was precarious. 
Being the magnanimous 
gentleman that he is, Seifert 
decided to help out 01' Wayne 
a bit by granting his tearn tbe 

cr three-point triumph.

After all, whenever San Fran 
has needed a big win in the put,

FAWNG: Loss to Pt. Lorna leaves a stunned

By ............ 
AssQclate Sports Editor 

Seventeen wins, no losses and a 
tie. That was the prior record of the 
UCSD men's soccer tearn against 

cross-town rival 
Point Loma 
Nazarene. That is, 
until yesterday. 

It happened at Tri-
ton Socc;er Stadium, 
and it wasn't pretty 
for the fans cheering 
...;:,~~- on tbeir beloved Tri-
ton squad. The Crusaders' Justin 
Demaree scored twice, leading his 
team to a first-cver victory over tbe 
UCSD men's ~r team, 2-1. 

Everything seemed happy-go-
lucky, as UCSD got off to a quick 
start in the early going. After taking 
possession away from the Crusad-
en, the Tritons' Chris Fong col-
lected a pass from 
teammate Jose 
O'Campo deep in 
the opposing box 
and fired a shot 
into the top right 
comer of the net, 
putting his team 
up 1-0 with only 
26 seconds gone from the' clock. 

..It was great to have that quick 
goal," UCSD Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong said. "But what you've 

got to do is get that second goal 
because we always talk about two 
[goals) killing a.8IIDe." 

On tbis day, the Tritons did not 
get that all-important second score, 
allowing Point Lomalo haQgaround. 

The score remained 1-0 through-
out mucb of tbe first half, as UCSD 
seemed content with its slim lead. 
Point Loma began to attack • bit 
more aggressively near the end of 
the half. 

And at 37:04, tbe Crusaders ef-
forts paid off when they tallied their 
first goal of the match on Cbris 
Wagner's sbot from 20 yards. 
Wagner's blast was redirected by 
Demaree and found its way past 
Triton goalkeeper Jason Reynoso. 

The second half began wbere the 
first balf ended. Point Lorna's con-
fidence was growing, and tbey 
looked to take the lead. At 52: 17, 

Demaree broke away down tbe left 
side of the field and beat ReyllOlO

David Morse searches 
for spirituality in 'An 
Ahnost Holy Picture' 

By Michael A. Schwartz 
Staff Writer 

American theater is trying more and more to 
emulate movies and television. It's becoming fast-
paced, angry, visually arresting and louder than rock 
'n' roll. [f the stage, as we know it, is destined to 
become one music video after another, consider La 
10lla Playhouse's "An Almost Holy Picture" -
making its world premiere at the Mandell Weiss ' 
Forum-tobetheequivaientof"MlVUnplugged." 

Written by Heather McDonald, this play is as 
fragile as Tennessee Williams' best work. Over the 
course of two hows, it tenderly explores humanity 
and faith through Samuel Gentle (David Morse), the 
groundskeeper for the Church of the Holy Com-
forter. We meet his daughter, "a misguided angel" 
afilicted with a condition that covers her entire body 
with golden hair, and his wife Miriam, victim of 
countless miscarriages. We meet people from both 
his present and his past, yet Samuel is alone on the 
stage. 

The one-man show is a bit of an anomaly. Captur-
ing the tone of a novel or diary, McDonald has 
craftcd a series of scenarios and memorieslhatgently 
guide us into one person's quiet view of life. SCt, 
literally, in the dirt and flagstone garden Gentle 
tends, the play is more accurately staged in his mind. 
Divided into four acts, the play begins with a wbis-
pered "follow me" that Gentle heard as a child. Later, 
as a young priest on assignment in the New Mexico 
desert, he meets an in-
dian woman and adopts 
her Hopi philosophies 
after a bus crash kills 
nine of the children in 
his care. 

Each year, on the an-
niversary of the acci-
dent, a friend sends 
beans, garlic and a jar 
of salsa verde in honor 
of each dead child. 

The language of the 
play is mesmerizin ~. 
Lengthy prose stor ~s 
contrast nicely with poetic snippelS of thought, as 
Gentle "offers up my day." EvenlS we do not sec 
become much more real in our minds than scenic 
design could ever capture. Words have always been 
the strength of theater, and this play provides proof.

Danc:Ina with the .,...: The Devil (David Garrison) leads a musical number In "Randy Newman's Faust.· 

Randy Newman provides plenty of 
laughs in his version of 'Faust' 

IIJ Jeff NI ... , 
Hiatus Editor 

For the last few years, pianist-singer Randy 
Newman has joked during live perfonnances 
that he has always wanted to write a version of 
"Faust." Newman would explain that he had 
even gone so far as to write some songs relating 
to his hypothetical play. Last Sunday, his joke 
became reality, as the La Jolla Playhouse intro-
duced the world premiere of" Randy Newman's 
Faust" at the Mandell Weiss Theatre. 

Directed by Midtael Greif, the play has all 
the endearing qualities of Newman's own work 
- sarcasm and jokes abound. But the plot, 
which centers loosely on the temptation of 
Notre Dame student Henry Faust (Kurt Deutsch), 
virtually falls apart midway through the produc-
tion. Tangential subplots, loose ends and an odd 
romance get in the way of an intriguing look at 
the role of God in our lives. 

"Randy Newman's Faust" has a promising 

enough start. After opening with a rousing 
gospel melody of "Pass On Over/Glory Train" 
in which the Lord (Ken Page) and his angels 
celebrate the creation of the world, the devil 
(David Garrison of "Married with Cbildren" 
fame) spoils the party. He tells the Lord and his 
angels that the rhetoric about the glory of God is 
simply "bullshit." God is understandably of-
fended and banishes the devil. 

Banishment suits the devil wen, however. 
He sets up office like a Wall Street businessman 
and, of course, has a steady stream of customers. 
Yet, despite his success, he's not happy. He 
visits God and bets that if he can corrupt one 
human, picked at random, God should let him 
return to heaven, This scene is one of the beller 
ones in the play because it's not entirely clear 
whether God is even happy in heaven. The devil 
likes heaven because the "air is clearer" and the 
quality of entertainment is higher, but heaven is 
hardly paradise.

Seven is the Eighth Deadly Sin 
Film uses gore to gain attention 

IIyT ..... Ladd 
Senior StIIff Writer 

Dircdor David Fmcber's new gory thrilJer,SeIa. 
his. lot of familiar sights. It's got Morgan Freeman 
playing U. William Somerset, an almost-reWed 
black cop who reads books on the·side. It has Brad 
Pitt as Detective David Mills, Freeman's young, 
white partner, who spouls dialogue like "At best, 
you're nothing but • T-shirt." And it's got a de-
mented serial killer played by Kevin Spacey, not to 
mention some fresh theme music. 

All Seven needs is Joe Pe5Ci and an Australian 
model. and then, it would be LetMI Weapon 4. 

But aside from the similarities, Seven 
does plenty of ils own damage in the 
cliche department. lis bleak landscapes, 
dark alleys and clever camera angles 
are too generic 10 be called film noir. ln 
fact, the gruesome killings and 
voyeuristic themes place it squarely in 
the "shock flick" genre. 

Freeman and Pitt slosh through a 
muddy plot line, tracking - if it can be 
called that - a serial killer intent on 
teaching the world 10 abstain from sin-
ning. With the grisly murdelll based on the seven 
deadly sins (gluttony, greed, etc.), Freeman and Pitt 
are always a step behind the killer, discovering 
revolting corpses as the movie progresses. 

More disgusting than the dead bodies, however, 
is&ven's blatant banality. M idway through the film, 
in a typical guy-bonding scene, a blurry-eyed Free-
man shares a drink with Pitt in a typical. trashy New 
York cop bar. (But remember: It's dark. It's daring. 
It's film noir.) 

In the moody surroundings of the bar, Freeman 
looks over at Don Johnson - excuse me - Pitt, and 
spews the typical discourse about how "bad every-

thing is in this world" and how "everyone is just 10 
damned apatbetic .. 

Watdaing this scene, I wanted to take a typic:al trip 
to the bathroom. . 

It doesn't get any better. As Seven rolls along, it 
refuses to rise out of its commonp1ace quagmire. 
After they discover the first murder - • man is 
fon:cd 10 eat until his intestines bum, as punishment 
fur his gluttony - Freeman asks the policle chief for 
a new partner. Here, you can almost picture Murtah 
(Danny Glover) complaining about Riggs (Mel 
Gibson) in the uthaJ Weapon series. 

Thechief,just like every otherchiefin every other 
oop movie, is rough and loud. He denies 
Freeman's request, and Freeman ap-
peaIll to lapse into a coma. For the rest of 
the movie, he conveys the emotional 
equivalent of a pound of jello. And 
thaI's actually an improvement on Pitt's 
lackluster performance. 

ClIemistry between Freeman and Pitt is 
equally listless. About the only scene in 
which the two cops seem to oommunicate 
with each other is during a visit to Pitt's 
horne. Gwenylh Paltrow, Pitt's "mil life" 

girlfriend, prepares dinnerforthe two men and a delight-
ful time is had by all- that is, until she goes headless. 

I apologize for "spoiling" the surprise ending 
involving her death, but if! can save jUSlone innocent 
student from witnessing this dud, my life wiU have 
true meaning. The last two climactic murders -
including Paltrow's-don 'tcorrespond 10 the seven 
deadly sins, as Ihe filllt five did. To this day, this 
leaves me in a severe state of puzzlement 

And while the credits so cleverly rolled down the 
screen after Seven was finally over, I was left with a 
feeling much like those people that Freeman was 
moaning about in the cop bar. I just didn't care.

'Angels in Amertca' 
Takes a Long Look at AIDS 

Actor Peter Birkenhead discusses the 
. . success o/Tony Kushner's play 

By Mlch .. 1 Schwartz 
Staff Writer 

It's a special kind of play in which a dying 
AlDS patient can greet a silver-winged angel 
crashing through the ceiling with the response: 
"very Steven Spielberg." "Angels in America," 
opening Oct .. 3 al the Sprec~els 1beatre down-
Iown, is just such a work. 

The sub-title of Tony Kushner's play is "A 
Gay Fantasia on National Themes. "It's not a bad 
six-word summalion for a play that runs just 
short of an average work day. The two-part epic 
clocks in at around seven hoUIll (including inter-
missions). 

Subplots weave in and around each other, 
overlapping in the strangest of places. Part one, 
"MillennjJJm Approaches," introduces Louis 
lronson (peter Birkenhead), a data processor 
whose lover dies. Joe Pitt, a worker in the same 
building, discovers his own homosexual identity 
despite being Mormon and married. His boS1I is 

Roy Cohn, a closet case who is never able 10 
oome 10 terms with his own sexuality or feelings 
of self-loathing. Kushner's script would have us 
believ.e that the whole world is IClually gay. 

Dreams overlap as Clwactelll meet in the 
ethereal space of magic and hope. Cohn con-
vellle5 with the executed Ethel Rosenberg and a 
Mormon diorama comes 10 life. 

It's impossible to sum up the plol. From 
anonymous sex in Central Park to orgasms with 
an angel, from emergency rooms 10 the Kremlin, 
Kushner depicts the landscape of our times. The 
charactclll are engaging and the story of a part-
time drag queen-turned-prophet is something 10 
behold. 11IeNewYorkeT'sJohnLahrdeclaresthe 
play "a victory for theater, for the transforming 
power of the imagination to tum deviation into 
beauty." -

Jolla Playhouse's" An Almost Holy Picture"),

ANGELS: 'This 
play is beyond 
allegiances' 
ContInued from ..... H3 
the current production of "Angels" 
began three montha of rehearsals in 
June of last year and went on the road 
after six montha in Chicago. It is cur-
rently booked at various locations 
through February of next year. This is 
an unprecedented feat for a play. Ex-
cept for big musicals and Neil Simon 
plays, few shows can tum a profit for 
their producers. 

Even Birkenhead, himself a vet-
eranofmany of Neil Simon's tours, is 
surprised by the success. 

"It's remarkable to me that a non-
musical play has achieved this kind of 
respect and popularity. It proves a lot 
of theatrical thought wrong. ff anyone 
ever pitched this play, it would never 
tly.ltprovespeoplearehungryforthe 
kind of theater it represents," he said 
during a recent phone interview. 

"This play is beyond allegiances. 
It'srichandambiguo~ There is some-
thing in this play that will touch every-

"And that's what theater is for. One 
thousand people sit in a room to share 
with each other." 

Birkenhead added that this pro-
duction of tile play is more human and 
intimate than its Broadway incarna-
tion. He also said that the play has 
affected its actors as much as its audi-
ence. 

"I feel really lucky and strong. All

Y rot its simplicitY and fragility are not 
only strengths. At times, they areweak-

Rather than relying on the mate-
rial, director Michael Mayer's Slag-
ing is overexplained and sometimes 
juvenile. Spooky background music 
ruins the inherent strangeness of st0-
ries about Gentle's time with Native 
Americans in Arizona. Every change 
in 1hought is punctuated with dra-
matic light changes. It seems that 
Mayer is simply trying too hard to 
determine what the audience should 
feel. 

As Gentle, Morae allows himself

Urge Overkill 
Exit the Dragon 

............. 

Urge qv~rkill's fifth album, Exit 
the Dragon, provides a new begin-
ning for the Cl!.icago group. Gone, for 
the most part, is the sonic rock 'n' roll 
.power previously demonstrated on 
'17se Supersonic Storybook and Satu-
ration. 

This swaggering bra-
vado has been replaced 
by a more sophisticated 
and mellow Urge . 

Songs such as "Some-
body Else's Body" and 
the lead track, 
"Jaywalkin,''' show that 
bassist King Roeser and 
guitarist Nash Kato have 
retained theirsongwriting 
skills, but have chosen to slow down 
the pace in order to highlight their 
soulful baritone voices. Drummer 
Blackie Onassis has sacrificed his 
pounding drums to conform to Urge's 
current sound, and he plays with pre-
cision. 

Urge'. kinder, gentler attitude 
doesn't mean that they have lost the 
ability to rock. The trICb "This Is No 
Place" and "And You'll Say" show-
case the band's ability to combine 
driving rhythms with elegant bridges. 

However, the band is 0b-
viously focusing its atten-
tion on its softer side this 
timeout. 

One of the prevalent 
themesofExiltheDrtlgon 
is the band's increasing 
disdai n for drugs. The title 
track w.rns listeners to 
"beware the overdose," 
and many of the other Iyr-
ics revea\ a group which is 

aware of its new direction. 
This theme, combin"ed with Urge's ' 

willingness to accentuate restrained 
melodies, attests to what the band 
might have cringed at a few years ago: 
maturity.

. Sex in Las Vegas 
Director Paul 'Verhoeven and 
screenwriter Joe Eszterhas hit· 
rock bottom with Showgirls 

By Jeff ....... 
Hiatus Editor 

In a recent issue of Variety, a trade 
. ~ journal devoted to film, saeenwriter 

Joe Eszterhas look out an ad to defend 
Paul Verhoeven's film SItowgirIs, for 
which be wrote the screenplay. In the 
ad, be asserts the film is 
not offensive to women, 
despite United Artists' 
nwketing campaign fea-
turing a sliver of a 
woman!s body on bill-
boards and posters. 

Fszterhassays that his 
intention was to show 
how women are reduced 
to sexual objects in our 
culture. Eszterhasa femi-

, . nist? Hardly. Despite his protests, the 
female characters in Showgirls are so 
poorly written, their lines make Beavis 
and Butthead look like intelJectuals. 
The film's inclusion of far-fetched 
lesbian scenes, the virtual absence of 
male nudity (with the exception of 
Kyle MacLachlan's butt) and theC08-
stant presence of naked women con-
test Fszterhas' claims of a cultural 
critique. 

-

Elizabeth Berkley makes her fea-
ture film debut as Nomi CampbelJ, a 
wayward dancer hoping to make it big 
in Las Vegas. When all her luggage is 

stolen by a guy who gives her a ride 
in his pickup, Nomi quickly falb to 
pieces. She is befriended by MoOy 
(Gina Ravera~ who offers to let her 
stay in her mobile home. Nomi gets 
a job at the a.eetah strip club but 
aspires to "dance" in a showgirl re-

vue. 
Nomi goes through 

rapid, inexplicable 
mood changes. One 
minute she laup like a 
giddy 12-year~1d, while 
the next she tells her 
slimy boss' AI (Robert 
Davi)to go to heU. When 
she starts to learn how to 
daiice, she does so by 
imitation, implying that 

sheisnothingbutanemptylhelJ.lt's 
hard to tell if the problem is with the 
way her character is written, or the 
fact that Berkley so clearly lacks any 
acting skills. In fact, she is so awk-
ward in her role, she makes Sharon 
Stone's similar performance in Ba-
sic 11IStinct (the last coUaboration 
between Verhoeven and &zterhas) 

_look like Academy Award material. 
While working at the strip club, 

Nomi is visited by Crista( (Gina 
Gershon), Star of the showgirl ~

give her boyfriend Zack (Kyle 
MacLachlan) a lap dance while Sht 
watches. Nomi goes all out, getting 
Zack to climax so he has to walk back 
to the chtb with a wet mess in his lap. 
The scene is more comical than arous-
ing. 

Cristal continues to stalk Nomi, 
getting her a job dancing in "God-
dess" and trying to seduce her in yet 
another ill-a>nceivedscene. The pr0b-
lem with both the lesbian and heter0-
sexual love scenes is that they are 
exaggerated. When lack and Nomi 
make love in lack's pool, Nomi 
thrashes about like a hooked fish. In 
fact, even when Nomi dances, she 
does 10 with such fon:ed intensity, 
that it's hard to believe inyone would

In the end, it's not clear what the 
message of the film is. NQmi decides 
to walk away from the fast-paced 
lifestyle of a showgirl and reconciles 
with everyone she might have pro- . 
voked. One conciliation: At least the
