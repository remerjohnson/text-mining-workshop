Bikes, skateboards banned 
By ERIC CHAZANKIN 
StaffWrittr 

A new policy, enacted by the 
UC D administration over the sum-
mer, has pruhibited the use of 
bicycles and skateboards in certain 
areas of the university. 

"Hopefully, we'll have a little bit 
safer campus, and reduce some of 
the accidents and injuries that 
have been a direct result of trying 
to put three modes of transporta-
tion (bicycles, skateboards, and 
pedestrians) in a one-mode area," 
Sgt. Rick Michelson , of the UCSD 
Police D~panment, aid . 

"The main thrust of the policy 
was to limit bicycle and skateboard 
riding through the main boardwalk, 
from the south end of HL to the 
end of the walkway by Peter on ... 
from 7:30 in the morning to 7:30 at 
night," Michelson added. 

"Some campuses will say, 'we 
don't allow skateboards, ~riod!' 
We didn't do that. We're just trying 
to reduce the risk to the student, 
and to anybody else." 

"There's been a preuy positive 
reaction ," MIchelson conrinued. "A 
lot of people are saying that they're 
glad that we finally did omething 
about it ," However, Michelson 
added that some of the signs an-
nouncing the policy have been 

either stolen or vandalized. 
In addition to the main walkway, 

the ban on bikes and skateboards 
also covers the walkways of the 
Univer ity Exten ion. Also, riding 
skateboards is now prohibited on 
the deck of the Mandeville Center, 
inside all campus buildings, and 
on all campu roads and parking 
lots. 

Michelson said that the policy 
was not the police department's 
idea - that it was formulated by 
the bicycle and skateboard com-
mittee appointed by the Vice Chan-
cellor Relyea, and " ... out of the 
committee's recommendations , 
came the poli cy," The univerSity is 
authorized by the vehicle code to 
regulate bicycle and skateboards, 
"[ so] ina sense, we've created a 
policy that becomes law . .. which 
will enable us to write citations for 
it if we need to," he said. 

However, ticketing will not begin 
Immediately. 'We're giVing them 
(the students) a grace period, really, 
for this quarter," Michelson re-
marked. "Right now, we're just giv-
ing verbal. .. educational pitches, 
saying 'Hey, this effects you -
here's what the changes are.'" 

The grace period will not be 
indefinite, though; Michelson con-
firmed that the police are planning 
on evenrually writing citations. The 

Parking shuttle

StaffWrittr 

"It' a lor beuer than driving to Los Angeles and 
back every day ," driver Damian 5trahl said , as he 
guided the heavily modIfied Ford van between the 
Mandeville parking lor and the Commuter Parking 
Lot #351 by the Institute of the Americas. 

Strahl, who had set the r:lcii o to KPBS to catch the 
morning news, started \l'orking for the Univer ity of 
California last year, drh ing to un A .md back for 
the UCSD's Central Lib rary. He sta rted on the 
campus shuttle route ';eptembcr 17 , the day it 
started. 

'" drove for three days without any passengers," 
he claimed, while his bus wa being filled to 
capacity in the ommuter lot. However, because of 
the heavy loads of students now using the campus 
shuttle , he has requested that another bus be put on 
the route to ope with the demand. 

Dave Mar hick , the A .. UC D preSIdent, is quite 
plea ed with the new campus shuttle sy tem. "I 
think II 'S great that It was started ," he said. "As the 
ampu grows and the surface lots grow further and 

further awa)', a shu.tde system like this, or'even an 
exp,mded one, WIll be a logical step." The re.uion 
of the campus shuttle ""hows students have ~ome 
1Il0uencc at UC -D," ,1.11 chIck saId . 

citations "will be like a ticket for 
running a stop sign, or for jay-
walking - the same type of format. " 
He added that a brochure will be 
out soon explaining the new policy. 

Michelson , who has been on 
patrol of the areas in question , 
commented that student reactIon 
has been 0 far faIrly good . "Ev-
eryone we've talked to has, . ,e ither 
not known, or not been familiar 
with I the policy]; I however], once 
we've told them, they've said , 'Oh 
- I understand ,' and gotten off the 
bike or skateboard and walked on." 
Also, the police have not heard 
from any student groups who op-
pose the policy. "There hasn't been 
any organized group the has come 
forward and made a complaint, 
that' know of," Michel on said . 

0 , aside from the theft and 
vandalism earlier mentioned -
acts regarded by Michelson as, 
"just an immediate rttl,ction" - the 
reaction to this new policy has 
been overall positive. 
"A lot of people are saying that 
they're glad we did somethingabout 
it. We've got letters and letters and 
letters of complaints - people 
complai n i ng about geui ng knocked 
over, getting hit by a skateboard or 
a bicycle, as well as the accidents 
and injuries we've had ," Michelson 
concluded.

The first graduate students to 
be a cepted into UCSD's new 
Graduate chool of International 
Relations and Pacific tudies 
(IR/ PS) began classes last week in 
one of the academic community'S 
most eagerly awaited and highly 
acclaimed Master's Degree pro-
grams. These 39 students -some 
of which have come from as far 
away as China,Japan and Argen-
tina- have been lauded as pio-
neers in the field of international 
relations and business. 

Created by the Boare! of Regents 
in 1986. this is the only graduate 
chool of international affair in 

the Univer ity of alifornla y-

Hormone in both sexes 
found harmful to women 

Researchers at the UC D chool of 
Medicine, who earlier reponed that high 
level of a little-understood hormone 
were associated with lower risk of hean 
disease and longer life span in men, now 
find this same hormone , dehy-
droeplandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), !O 
have the opposite effect In women 

In a letter published In the September 
10 Issue of the The New England}oumal 
of Medicine, researchers report they 
followed 289 women, age 60 to 79 years, 
to dete rmine whether the same inverse 
relationship between DHEAS levels and 
mortality holds true in women. They 
found hean disease and mortality rates 
were highest among women with the 
hIghest DHEAS levels . 

DHEAS is a major hormone secre ted 
by the adrenal gland. Little is known 
about its function , however, and there is 
no known way to either raise or lower 
DHEAS levels in the blood . 

This mo~t recent finding , which IS 
undergoing more detailed examination, 
IS pan of a long-range population study 
of the San Diego communay of Rancho 
Bernardo. The study was begun in the 
early 1970s by Dr Elizabeth Barrett-
Connor, chair of UCSD's Department of 
Co mmuniry and Family Medicine and 
prin-ci ple autho r of th is study. 

Co-authors on the study are Kay-Tee 
Khaw, M.R. C P, M.5c., assistant adjunct 
pro fe ssor of community and family 
medicine; and Samuel S.c. Yen, M.D., 
professor of reproductive medicine. 

CMRR atUCSD 
awarded $1 .6 million 

The National Sc ience Foundation has 
awarded the Umverslty of California, San 
Diego a $1.65 mtlhon grant for a three-
year period to study the microscopic 
properties of magnetiC materials. The 
research will be carried out through the 
Center for Magnetic Recording Research 
at UCSD , and represents the largest grant 
to CMRR in its four-year history. CMRR 

BLOOM COUNTY 

began funding the research about three 
years ago, and will proVide slgniricant 
funding during Ihe next three rears for a 
total contribution of about 'Ii I 5 million . 

CMRR was established In 1983 With 
major industry backing to Improve 
magnetic recording technology. Its 
research is devoted to in reaslng Ihe 
amount of data that can be stored on a 
tape or disk , Improving the rehablhty of 
computer disk recorders, laying the 
groundwork for smaller and hghter 
eqUipment, and increasing the speed 
and preciSion of magnetic tape and disk 
production. 

The goal of thiS project is to 
"understand more definitively the 
behavior of magnetic materi als used in 
recording media so we ca n more readily 
accommodate higher denSity info rmation 
storage," accordi ng to Ami Berkowitz, 
project director and holder of an 
endowed chair at CMRR. Sheldon 
Shultz , UCSD professor of physics and 
one of the co-invest igators on the 
project, explained that the researchers 
were concerned about the next 
generation of magnetiC storage 

The goal is to enable more information 
storage capabiliry on the magnetic media 
such as computer disks, audio and video 
tapes. To accomplish this, researche rs 
must learn more about the behavior of 
the microscopIc magnetiC units which 
make up magnetic recording media. "The 
grant allows us to pursue a research 
program to understand the interaction of 
ultra-fine magnetic panicles," chultz 
said . 

UCSD was chosen by the Natiqnal 
Science Foundation as one of four new 
national Materials Research Groups 
which are sharing funding of $7 .4 
million.

mediator. to end their 9-week-long 
impasse with UC Management . 

Bargaining co mmittee members voted 
on ept. 13 to urge the UC syslem's 
9,000 ervice employees to apporve the 
contract se ttl eme nt , but are 
recom mending rejeclion of the 
mediator's proposals for the Palient Care 
Techmcals (3 ,200 employees) and 
Clerical ( 16,000) units. 

The mediator was called in after 
AF CME Council 10 and UC 
Management declared impasse onjuly 9. 

"U nfortunalely the settlement fails to 
resolve key issues of concern to Clerical 
and Patient Care Technical employees," 
said Council 10 Executive Director 
Nadra Floyd. "The university is 
attempting to weaken employee rights 
regarding layoffs and is offering Ratient 
Care Technical employees less than the 4 
percem increase already allocated by the 
State." Ratification votes will be held on 
the university's nine campuses and at the 
five teaching hospitals.

Condom machines find homes at UCSD 
By ISABELLE C. TIHANYI 
SlaffWrilO' 

A few o f Ihe ma ny condom 
vend ing machines which will be 
placed in UCSD restrooms were 
installed in both the male and 
female student ce nter rest rooms 
before the start of the fall quarter. 

Supplied by Ihe univers ity to 
promote 'safer sex', the 50¢ pro-
phylacticae are being sold as part 
of an AS initialed project. 

The original idea for the ma-
chines came from A.S. Council mem-
ber Dave Friend and was approved 
this summer by the Health Center 
and Vice Chancellor joseph Wat-
son. 

John W. Giebink, Direclor of 
Student Health, discussed the ven -
ture. "We at Student Health wanted 
to make condoms readily available 
in the overall prevemion of the 
s pread of AIDS. Students are very 
likely to have sexual encounters 
With people they don't know that 
well. .. we are not pro moting sex, 
we just want to promote safer sex." 

"We felt we had an obligalion to 
make condoms (more) ava ilable. 
We've had them for years III Ihe 
Health Cen le r and would hke to 
have vendlllg machines in eac h of 
the ma.Jor residential areas so they'll 
be available on a 24 hour basis." 

Giebink also memio ned the pos-
Sibi lity of adding coOOO::1S to the 
outdoor vending kiosks located 
ncar the hookstore and tenms 
courts. "SllIdent HeJlth would like 
to show thai condoms shouldn't be 

hidden away bUI brought out intO 
the ope n ," Giebink sa id . "Per-
sonally," he added , "I Irke the idea 
of a cond om being easier to buy 
than a coke. But it's really importam 
for students to know that usi ng a 
condom is sa fer sex .. . but it's no 
guarantee . Usually failure occurs 
when the condom has not been 
used properly. There is no 100 
percelll guarantee. 

lation of the machines involved a 
co mmittee led by Glebink. A report 
was se nt to Dr. Watson who ap-
proved the proposal and a ve ndor 
was contacred . "We were looking 
for a serviceable and unabtrusive rna· 
chine. Our main conce rn was with 
va ndalism .. . we needed a ve ndor 
who would both service and replace 
any broken machines ," Carruthers 
sa id . 

"By increasing the availability of con-
doms to UCSD students, the university is 
not only promoting 'one-night-stands,' 
but also increases the AIDS virus among 
students who believe that sex with a 
condom is safe sex," 

Jim Carruthers, DirectOr of the 
University Cemer, explained that 
the return on each unit is approxi-
mately 10-1 I ¢ . which helps to mai n-
tai n the restrooms. "Data suggests 
that 2 per day are sold, although we 
haven'l golten Ihe first monthly 
report . The sales are ex pected to 
ri se as more students beco me aware 
of the new machines. 

"They are put into both restrooms 
because Stat isti cally women are 
known to huy more condoms than 
men ."

The brand used IS "rotex. "The 
condo ms are tested in the u.s. and 
the manufacturer carries in sur-
ance ... UCSD is not responsib le 
for liabiliry," Carruthers said . 

According to both Gieblnk and 
Carruthers, reactions throughout 
the UCSD Community have been 
positive. "They are a great thing to 
have on campus. It's a s tatement. 
about the univers ity and students 
playing their role In fighting 
disease," A.S. President Dave Mar-

Future condom vending machines may be placed in outdoor 
kiosks, according to John Giebink, Director of Student Health.

Everyone has seen those signs 
that proclaim the main drag on 
campus to be off limits to "bike 
bums" and "skate rats" - haven't 
they? Well , if the signs haven't all 
been srolen yet, you're bound to see 
one - and promptly Ignore It. 

On the surface, the prohibition 
of bikes and skateboards is a good 
safety measure. During those c1ass-
changing minutes (from ten before 
the hour on Monday. Wednesday 
and Friday, and every 30 minutes 
or so on Tuesday and Thursday 
when the main drag has a higher 
population density than Singapore , 
bike bums and skate rats brush 

pedestrians, cut others ofr. get into 
a cldents, etc. 

During those rimes you hardly 
gain anything by riding a bike or 
skating through , so you might as 
well not bother. It's faster taking a 
penpheral route and you're more 
likely to avoid the T.A. whose 
section you didn't atte nd yesterday. 
It's faster along those peripheral 
routes, if the truth be told . 

The problem is, when it's not a 
class·changIng time, the maIn drag 
is empty; desolate, with a popula-
tion denSity of the Gobi desen. You 
could walk from Third to Revelle 
and see no one but fire depanment 

joggers and the "nower lady." You 
could bicycle blindfolded from Rev-
elle to APM and hit nothing but 
buildings and "No bicycle/No skate-
board" signs. 

It is only during some 10 crowded 
minutes every hour or so that rhe 
mad TLH/ USB dash imperils life 
and limb 

So, if we could change the rule to 
prohibit biking and skaling on rhe 
main drag only during the "rush 
minutes," when biking or skating 
isn't going to get you to point B that 
much quicker anyway, the rule 
would be that much more palatable, 
at least to this writer.

Editor: 

I read your piece on the UCSD 
Administration and I am moved to 
respond with this letter. I think its , 
great that you are contributing to 
the UC5D Guardian , especially at 
the beginning of the school year 
when we all are so busy. 

ThiS is not why I have written 
though. I think you are ei ther 
writing for the effect of aggitation 
through exaggeration or are nOI yet 
mature. I don't need or want to go 
through your entire letter point by 
pOint, but I will leI you know how at 
least one other UCSD studem ob· 
server sees things. 

Neither of us really knows what a 
"gestapo-like" enforcemem of any 
policy is hke. I have probably experi· 
enced something much closer to il 
Ihan you, but so what. UCSD's nOt 
tough on enforCing almost any pol· 
icy except parking Violations and 
dropadd deadlines. 

As for the red curbs on Torrey 
Pines Road. your own rag the Guar· 
dian told us about thaI last year It 
was a deCISIOn made by the Ity 
council and nol implemented or 
controlled by UC D Admml~tra

to do the trick!! And certai nly the 
Guardian can qe trusted to always 
let the reader have an unbiased 
balanced view. 

As for the cost of parking permits. 
you just wail till you see what you 
pay when you go to work someday. 

Many would love to pay only $13 a 
momh for unlimited ground level 
parking. Try and visit' the SDSU 
library someday and then complain. 

You seem a bit spoiled and 
arrogant to me. Do you rtallytx~ct

a shuttle se rvice? I believe one is 
planned already, if what I read in 
the Guardian last quarter can be 
believed, but if not , apply the 7 Ps 
and avoi d the crush . 

As for the coeds walking to their 
cars, your adVice is good , but our of 
character WIth the tone of the 
article. What sneaky ad ministrator 

has allowed the C.S.O program to 
develop anyway? It' s outrageous! 
Why, they're probably go ing ro get 
swas tica arm bands for them this 
year and .. its too absurd to con-
tinue. 

As for the hIke and skateboard 
ban , I am glad to see it. I have been 
startled and jostled a few times on 
the walk going north from Revelle 
Plaza, and so have "95 percent of 
us ." The administrators were prob-
ably trying to get up to standard 
with other UC campuses which 

have mu h beuer(and often tough-
er) controls on skateboards and 
bicycles. At the University of Ari · 
zona, where I've (s ic) attended be-
fore UCSD, a bike on the sidewalk 
or fai lure to sto p at a stop sign wi ll 
get you a ticket l 

And it COUnts just like any other 
In COUrt , as points on your record 
and rate hikes for automobile insur-
ance. UCSD is so sneaky and 
rough!! UCD has even tougher 
policies for bikes!! The two intersec· 
tions at the Warren apartment 

Do you think putting condom machines in campus 
restrooms is a good way of combatting AIDS? 

"I suppose It ca n't hurt , bur just 
plaCing condoms in bathrooms isn't 
going to be enough. I think people need 
to be educated on how it is spread, so 
they know what hind of sItuations to 
avoid." 

-G.ryOtake 
Revelle, Sr. 

"Yes,1 think it 's a good way to co mbat 
that. It malles them easier to purchase. 
You can go up to a machine and buy 
them, because some people might find it 
embarraSSing to go to a store and buy 
condoms, and would avoid it."

We know that a 
cheap calculator can 
cost you blood, sweat 
and time, 

Investing in a 
Hewlett-Packard cal-
culator, on the other 
hand, can save you 
time and again. 

HP calculators not 
only have better func-
tions. They function 
better. Without stick-
ing keys and bad 
connections. 

Through October 
31, you can get the 
cream of the calcula-
tors at a non-fat price. 

We're cutting $10 
off the HP-12C That 
buys you more built-
in functions than any-
one else's financial 
calculator. 

And we're giving 
away a free Advantage 
Module, a $49 value, 
with every HP-41 
Advanced Scientific 
calculator you buy_ 
This 12K-byte plug-
in, menu-driven ROM 
was designed spe-
cially for students. 

So drop by your 
campus bookstore and 
compare HP calcula-
tors with the rest. By 
midterm, you'll see 
what a deal this is.

$2 billion in funds requested by DC 
UC PRESS RELEASE 

The University of California will 
seek just over $2 billion in state 
funds as pan of a 55 .4 billion 
operating budget proposal present-
ed to a jOint committee of the UC 
Board of Regents in 5an Francisco. 

The state funding request, which 
is about 8 percent higher than the 
1987 -88 budget, includes S 154 mil-
lion in new state funds. The pro-
posed budget will be considered by 
the full board at its Nov. 19-20 
meeting at UC Riverside. 

The proposal includes a $160 
million capital improvements bud-
get, plus $49 million capital funding 
for the Davis,lrvine and San Diego 
teaching hospitals. Proposals for 
salary increases for faculty and staff 
will be presented laterthis fall. U n-
der the plan , which is consistent 
with a long-term fee policy adopted 
in 1985 by the Legislature and 
endorsed by students and approved 
by the UC Regents, educational 
and registration fees paid by st . 
dents would increase 4.4 percent. 

UC President David P. Gardner 
said the university's improved bud· 
get situation over the past four 
years "reflects confidence in and 
commitment to UC on the part of 
the governor, the legislature and 
the university's alumni and friends 
through out the world. 

"We wish to maintai n the im· 
proved resource base that has now 
bee n a ttai ned ," he said , " to fund 
fi xed costs and en rollment increas-
es. to reduce the bac klog of i n truc-
tlonal equipment and deferred main-
tcna nce, and to make. ome mndesl

The budget ,lsks 0; 13 H mlllion

serve an expct'led mcrease of .1hOUI 
2,500 unciergr'lciuates. and $2.9'; 
milli o n 10 support of 600 more 
graduate students in 1988-89. Ano-
ther $25 .5 mil ion is sought for 
merit salary Increases, and $21.2 
million to offset inflation in price 
increases. "Absent full funding for 
these budget items," Gardner said, 
"we must divert resources from 
existing programs in order to meet 
the unavoidable costs. Such diver-
sion of resources has been neces-
sary for the las t two yea rs due to 
inadequate fund ing of fixed COStS, 

Slightly more th a n $50.8 million 
is proposed for p rogram improve-
ments in teaching, research, public 
and student services, libraries and 
plant maintenance. Included is $4 
million requested for replacement 
of obsolete instructional equipment, 
and $4 million for deferred main-
tenance projects. 

Gardner also highlighted a new 
graduate student research assistant-
ship program, which is designed 
to attract talented individuals to 
fields where their skills are badly 
needed . 

For example , shortages of doc-
torally trained engineers and com-
puter scientists are anticipated na-
tionally: 1,600 faculty positions in 
these diSCiplines are currently un-
filled . Similarly, demand for arts 
and humanities scholars is expect· 
ed 10 rise dramatically. And, as 
California's community colleges 
struggle with questions related to 
mission, governance and financi ng, 
doctorally educated community col-
lege adminislratorS will be sought 
to provide the leadership reqUired 
to meet these complex challenges. 

Therefore, the uf1l l'erslty seeks

of several other intiatlves. A new 
academic transfer program 
($375 ,000) would develop partner-
ships between UC and community 
college faculty. And a summer bridge 
program (S5OO,OOO) would help 
transfer students, especially under-
represented minorities, make a suc-
cessful transition. Two articulation 
programs would apply 5825 ,000 
in new money toward dfons to 
simplify the process by which 
course credit is transferred between 
all three segments of higher educa-
tion. 

UC's efforts to improve under-
graduate education would be en-
hanced through funding of an ad-
ditional $1.77 million for 83 teach-
II1g assistants (TA), which would 
bring the sllldent-to-TA average 
ratio back to the 1971 -72 level of 
about 42-L Another $500 ,000 is 
requested 10 expand the TA training 
programs. 

"This will make a real difference 
in the quality of undergraduate 
education," said Budget and Uni-
versity Relations Vice President 
William Baker, "because it will pro-

vide more students the opportu-
nity for small-group discussions 
and personal feedback on papers 
and lab work." 

The university seeks an addition-
al S2 .7 million in affirmative action 
funding to expand current pro-
grams, presently supported by 516.l 
million annually - and to add two 
new effons; the community college 
summer bridge program, and an 
undergrad'Jate minority scholars 
program designed to attract un-
derrepresented students into grad-
uate school. 

"U ndergraduate enrollment of 
underrepresented minontles rose 
45 percent in [he last five years," 
said Baker. "while undergraduate 
enrollment in general increased 12 
percent. Nonetheless , Within the 
university community, most minor-
ity groups remain underrrepre-
sented - and we must strengthen 
our efforts to change that. 

The budget also seeks funding 
increases for California Writing . 
Mathcmatics and Science projects, 
designed to improve the skills of 
elementary and secondary teachers 

in those diSCiplines: and $578 ,000 
for a Davis campus effort to translate 
research results in the education 
field to kjnderganen-through-12th 
grade practice. 

In research, a total of $5 .25 
million in added funding is request-
ed to support activities in astron-
omy ($1 million for the W.M. Keck 
Observatory project), the Pacific 
Rim ($250,000). programs of aging 
(S500,OOO), manufacturing technol-
ogy (SI million), earthquakes (SI 
million), biotechnology ($500,000), 
agricultural issues ($)00,000), forest 
and rangeland water s hed s 
($400,000) and aquaculture and 
fisheries ($300,000) 

Library assis tan ce is sought 
through a $1 workload increases 
and $2.38 million for an increase 
In acquisi tions and related staff. 

To adequately maintain the uni -
versity reference buildings, the bud-
get calls for an increase of $4 
million , plus $2 million for expan-
sion of the janitorial staff. Another 
$) .4 million i!> requested to main-
tain new space 10 be occupied in 
1988-89 by programs eligible for 

state funding. 
The university also seeks to re-

duce the budgetary savings target, 
aSSigned by the state to recognize 
savings which naturally accrue due 
to vacant pOSitions. Currently, the 
target is 4 percent meaning UC is 
expected to return to the state 4 
cents of every dollar of approved 
program funding. 

"This consritutes an increasingly 
burdensomt drain on academic 
programs," Gardner sa~d , noting 
that this "forced" savings frequently 
means that filling essential posi-
tions is delayed. He said UC hopes 
10 reduce the target 10 2 percent 
over the next three years, beginning 
with a $ 12 million adjustment in 
1988-1989. 

The preSident said the capital 
budget request "reflects the broad 
nature and extraordinary magni-
tude of the university's need for 
new facilities and the renovation of 
exisiting ones. It will be many more 
years before the university'S physi-
cal plant is anywhere near adequate 
to support its insrructional and 
research programs."

Think again. 
Since January 1987, AT&n 

rates have dropped more than 
15% for direct-dialed out-of-
state calls. So they're lower than 
you probably realize. For infor-
mation on specific rates, you 
can call us at 1 800 222-0300. 

And AT&T offers clear long

can use AT&T to call from 
anywhere to anywhere, all over 
the United Stares and to over 
250 countries, 

You might be surprised at 
how good a value AT&T really 
is. So before you choose a

Shuttle 
Continued from page 1 
Tuesday the number of riders increased 
substantially. Umstead accounts for the 
sudden increase by observing that Tuesday 
was the first day of classes and that there 
was a grace period on parking. 

Umstead is equally pleased by the low 
cost of the program, which he estimated at 
$45,000 per year. "You have the cost of the 
vehicle, the gas and the maintenance, and 
we're going from 7am to midnight , so we 
obviously have a few different drivers so 
there's the labor cost. Still, it's pretty 
cheap," 

parking," Umstead stated. Funds from 
parking violation Hnes, which at UCSD are 
intended for altemative transponarion, 
were not used to pay for the campus 
shuttles. 

Students like the shuttle too. "I saw it go 
by one day and said, "Hey, this looks like a 
good idea," John LeMoncheck said . Lori 
Messie remarked, I read aboU! it in the flyer 
they sent in the mail." Her friend Denise 
Laspey said that she learned about it 
having "watched it on the news." 

The shuttle is funded by parking permit 
fees. "It's purpose in life is just serving 

Umstead is optimistic about the shuttle's 
fmure . "The shuttle will continue, obviously, 
but in winter quarter we'll evaluate it and 
ask if we want to expand it or expand the 
routes. We want to five it a few months to 
settle down." The 25-passenger shuttle takes about 15 minutes from one end of its route to the other.

Controversial weapons 
lab contract renewed 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
News Edtlor 

In the midst of a stormy debate 
over the role of the University of 
CalIfornia as manager of the Los 
Alamos and Lawrence Livermore 
weapons laboratories, the UC Re-
gents decided on ept. 18 to con-
tinue that role, voting 17-3 for 
approval of new, five-year contracts 
with those laboratories. Also ap-
proved was a contract of equal time 
for running the Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory, which performs no 
weapons research 

The contracts 
The contracts are largely Similar 

to thc previous agreements, though 
the university claims to have a-
chieved four goals they had set 
before negotiation began. Those 
goals Include: Increased collabor-
ation between UC o.:ampuses and 
rhe weapons laboratories; use of 
laboratories; use of laboratory ex-
penise to enhance UC programs; 
increased commercialization oflabor-
atory research results; and reno-
vating the physical plant at the Law-
rence Berkeley Laboratory. 

The objective of increased colla-
boration will be met in two ways: 
first , lab directors will be asked to 
increase funding for such effons, 
which is now in the area of $3 
million a year; second, the man-
agement fee the univer-ity charges 
10 run all three labs (and which has 

been increased from $34.3 million 
to $62 .5 million) Will also be used 
to fund collaborat ive efforts. 

Several revisions, or additions, 
to contract clauses will provide for 
increased commercialization oflab 
results, as well as increase the 
number of inventions to which UC 
will have tide. Whether the results 
arising from defense-related re-
sear h at the Livermore and Los 
Alamos arc included in this deal 
was not speci fied In the UC press 
release that ouLllned the new con-
tfacts. 

The fi nal objective conccrned 
improving the physical plant at the 
Berkeley laboratory, and thc con-
tract provides for "examination of 
this need" as stated In the press 
release. 
The controversy 

Less than a week before contract 
negotiations were to begin, 48 Uni-
versity of California physicists 
wrote a leller to UC President 
David P. Gardner regarding UC 
management of the Los Alamos 
and Livermore labs. I n it they state 
how "disturbed (they were) to learn 
from a Los Angeles Times anicle that 
the Weapons Laboratories' design 
strategies over the last decade or 
more are said to be inconsistent 
with a comprehcnsive test ban 
(CTB) in the foreseeable future ." 
They then pointed out how the 
Laboratories claimed that existing 
nuclear weapons need tesiing to 

insure workability, while simultan-
eously keeping an cye on future 
weapons projects, such as a nuclear 
powered x-ray laser, which require 
nuclear explosions during the test-
ing period . 

The letter continued , "As the 
university shares in the manage-
ment of the laboratories, it also 
shares responsibility .. . The Soviet 
Union has recently unilaterally 
stopped testing and asked the U.S. 
to join it under the provisions of a 
verifiable CT B. This imponant pos-
sibility IS now endangered by the 
posture of the Weapons Laborator-
ies which is contrary to stated U.S 
poliCies by being consistent with 
the needs of new weapons sys-
tems .. r weapon designJ must allow 
for the wnungenry oj progress towards 
nuclear disarmamenr." 

The phYSICists' demands, as fol -
lows, included having the ul1lvcr~i ­
ry " forcefully propose" several steps 
to the lab directors. 

"1. Develop a ... design and 
testing program which will point 
towards the timely end of nuclear 
weapons testing. 

"2. Develop a firm time-frame for 
the completion of item (I) .. . 

"3. ln the interim reduce nuclear 
weapons tests to only those neces-
sary for implementation of item 
( 1)." 

One of the twO primary signees 
of the March 14 leuer was Physics 
Professor Walter Kohn of the U niver-

U C is "landlord" of labs 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
News Editor 

Controversy over the UC-weapons labs connection was a natural 
outgrowth of ~uch an unusual pairing, and the first inquiry into the 
relationship between the University and the labs was made in 1969. 
The Zinner Commission (named for chairman and Political 
Science Professor Paul E. Zinner of UC DaVIS) confronted such 
questions as: (as stated in a UC press release) Was UC tarnishing 
its good name by supportmg weapons research? 

The Zinner Commission report concluded, with some dissent, 
that while there was nothmg inherently wrong with UC's manage-
ment of the Livermore and Los Alamos labs, UC should e'Xercise 
much stronger management. While describing UC's position as 
that of a "benevolent absentee landlord ," the report stated that there 
is "nothing odious" about conducting defense research which 
might otherwise be run by industry or the civil service, which 
"might not act with the restraint and the spirit of independence 
that characterizes labs under the university." 

In 1978, a committee chaired by former UCLA Executive Vice 
Chancellor William Gerberding was charged wllh answering the 
question, "Is there somethl ng in the very nature of nuclear weapons 
research that makes it impossible under any conditions to counten-
ance malntaming the connection between UC and the Labs?" 
According to a UC press release , the answer was no, but the 
commince "stro ngly endorsed more management by UC , including 
establishment of a board of overseers 10 monitor the work done at 
the labs." Thus, the Regents' Oversight Committee was established 
In 1980. 

In 1983, the Assembly ot the Academic Senate passed a. 
resolution asking that the Institute for Global Conflict and 
Cooperation at UC San DIego have oversight responsibility for the 
labs. This resolution was not implemented . Several faculty votes 
have also been taken on whether to sever ties with the labs. In 1980, 
of the 1,833 members of the Berkeley division of the Academic 
Senate who were asked the question, 70 percent returned ballots -
786 were in favor of maintaining UC manage-men! and 526 were 
opposed. In 1984, UC Santa Cruz Academic Senate members voted 
88-69 to sever ties with the labs. Finally, in 1985 Berkeley faculty 
members vot-ed agam, and of the 40 percent who filled out ballots. 
380 desired to retain the status quo, and 357 wanted to divest UC of 
the labs.

a unique synthesis of international 
management know-how and a spe· 
cialized understandingof a partlcu· 
lar COU ntry or regIon in the PacifiC. 

o that they may develop a more 
thorough understanding of a partic-
ular culture, the students will stud), 
at least tWO years of Chinese,Japan-
ese , or Spanish , depe nding on 
their choice of regional speciali· 
zation. 

"I want to be able to conve rse 
with the people I'm interested in ," 
IR/ PS Graduate Student Doming 
Liu said , "in order to be able to 
understa nd that country more com· 
pletely." 

With a regional focus on China, 
Doming, a UC Berkeley graduate 
student III ASian Studies cites a 
need fo r people who can under· 
stand the Chinese better in husllless 
and political relations, "There are 
not many people out there, beSIdes 
academIcia ns, who really know the 
Chllle e people well .. who know 
the cul ture and how to Interact 
with the people in the nght way," 
Domlllg said . 

In ilJd ltlOn to the regional spe-
ialIzauon, the students choose a 

parttcular career specialization in 
either international management, 
international relations or compara· 
tive public policy . 

The program expects each new 
entering class to grow by 20 to 30 
students annually, according 10 Gou-
revitch , By 1991 , the school plans 
to have an estimated 400 graduate 
students enrolled in Master's, Ph.D , 
and Advan ed CareerTrainingPro-
gra ms. In order to accommodate 
these new students, and the , esti-
mated 35 full·tlme facult)" the uni-

Sit)' of C.lltlorniil, Santa Barbar,\ In 
" telephone interview, Dr, Kahn 
descnbed the tssue of weapon 
reliability as "scandalous," saying 
"t he great majomy of independent 
experts ... including former direc-
tors orthe laboratories ... I saidl the 
weapons were extremely reliable." 
The laboratories brought up this 
issue, said Dr. Kohn, ra ther than 
admit they were seeking some of 
the large amount of funding to be 
spend on the StrategiC Defense 
initiative, or "Star Wars" project. 

"Our leiter was ai med at the 
UniverSity ... saying, look. the Uni· 
ve rsity is managing the laboratories, 
please, see to 1(... that, indeed , 
whatever is needed to make the 
existing weapons more reliable be 
dam: ," Dr. Kohn said . "I The Uni-
versityl in our view, had a responsl' 
bili ty, to see that tl- labora tory 
dIreCtors advice to thL government 
was proper ... particularly in this 
sit uation, where the weight of in-
dependent opinion was so much 
comrarv to that of the directors. 
We fel; the UllIversi ty ought to 
undertake whatever was proper for 
the University to do to lear up that 
si tuation." 

The Un iversity responded by 
having the ientific andAcademi 
Advisory Committee (SMC) investl· 
ga tc the faculty members' charges.

Affirmative Action 
Students represent the underrepresented 
By KRISTEN MCCLEARY 
Ftaturtll Editor 

Affirmative action is working on all UC 
campuses to ensure that faculty and stu-
dents are representative of the diverse 
populations of California. Only at UCSD 
however, is there an organization that 
monitors the progress and development of 
M - the SmdentAffirmative Action Com-
minee (SMC). 

"SMC looks at how this school can 
improve so it's more open for everyone. 
This mcludes older returnees disabled 
low income and transfer stud~nts. SAAC 
doesn't JUSt deal with ethniC groups or 
people of color," Mary Morales, an AAC 
~udent intern , said. 

The stude nt members of SAAC monitor 
vanous departments on campus, ranging 
from acad mlcs to finanCIal aSSlstan e to 
student life The com mmee submits bi-
weekly said . Uncovenng and dismantling 
these obstacles is what SAAC IS all about. 

Affirmative Action itself IS a program 
which elicits much debate in university 
Circles. It is often argued that AA is a way 
for the "undeservmg" to get into the univer-
si ty sys tem to the exclusion of "deserving." 
This is an argument that can eas ily be 
defused If one looks to the origins of AA In 
the 60s, a("cording to Shoon Lio, an SAAC 
student intern. When the program was 
first implemented its priority was to set a 

fioor on the adminance level below which 
the amount of underrepresented students 
who were accepted could not fall. "Now 
affirmative action is seen as a ceiling," Lio 
said . 

The difference of opinion regarding the 
purpose of AA exposes the policy to 
controversy and the play of politics, Instead 
of being seen as a uniting force , some 
people think that AA actually leads to the 
separation of underrepresented groups 
from the'mainstream 'As a result , Lio said, 
"The different ethnic groups, genders and 
races get played off against each other due 
to a lack of under tanding of cultural 
roles," 

On the university level. howeve r, It s 
obvious th at AAC is a force as it brings 

"Last year only 
3 percent of the 
graduating class 
were Mexican Ame-
rican and 3 percent 
were black, There 
are things going on 
in this institution , .. 
that are not allow-
ing these popula-
tions to succeed, " 

-Mary Morales 

together several organizations such as the 
ASian PaCific Student Alliance (APSA), the 
Women's Resource Center (WRC). the 
Disabled Student Services (DSS), the Af-
ncan American Student Union (AASU ) 
and MeCha. 

"We are a resource to othe r students and 
clubs, helping them find the appropriate 
financial and social resources to keep 
them gOlOg at UCSD," saidJohn Ramirez, a 
SMC research imern. 

The University of California Student 
Association (UCSA) is the system-wide 
task force which allows SAAC to see how 
AA is working on the other UC campuses,

said, "Right now uc Santa Cruz is looking 
to implement a SAAC intern program 
based on our system here." 

The SMC organization at UCSD consists 
of seven student interns, a chair, co-chair, 
representatives from APSA, AASU , DSS, 
WRC, MeCha and their program advisor, 
Dennard Clendenin. The research interns 
are in charge of monitoring and studying 
distinct target areas of special importance 
to SAAC. 

His research internship concentrates on 
Student Outreach And Recruitment (SOAR). 
Ramirez cites lack of information as being 
the primary barrier which stops under-
represented students from reaching their 
full scholastic potential. 

A dearth of appropriate role models, 
financial concerns and fear that they won't 
fit in to the social life at a major university 
are concerns which steer many high school 

ucs,o is the only UC campus with an organization that 
monitors the progress of affirmative act ion on campus, 

Mary Morales, for example, studies the 
adva ncement of underrepresented students 
into the field of graduate work. "The way I 
see it ultimately IS (as) a goal to get more 
underrepresented students into faculty po-
sitions," she said. The first step to becoming 
a faculty member is a grad schooL Because 
the low percentJge of graduating students 
from AA works against her, Morales con-
ce ntrates on helping students m their 
junior and senior years. 

She stresses the need to maintain or 
achieve a good g.p.a., but adds that low 
g.p.a.'s should nOt deter students from 
graduate school. Strong letters of recom-
mendation and student internships can 
help a student gel accepted to higher 
education. 

John Ramirez, another student intern , 
concentrates on the oppOSite end of college 
life; that is LO say, he looks to the beginning. 

students away from a univerSity education . 
SOAR tries to reach these high school 
students and disseminate informalion on 
where they can get fundi ng for college, as 
well as to serve as student role models and 
direct incoming students to social actiVIties. 
" OAR's goal is to make UC San Diego a 
culturally diverSified society; a mirror of 
the SOciety of California as a whole," 
Ramirez said. 

As an executive intern, Cedric Lewis 
acts as the Iiason between various campus 
co mmittees. He sits lo on meetings of AS. 
organizations and the chancellor's Affirma-
tiveA tion co mmittee, serving as the SAAC 
student voice. "When you talk of affirmative 
action on campus, there's a lot of things 
going on. It includes EOP (Education 
Opportunity Program), OASIS and Sum-
mer Bridge (the orientation program for 
incoming underrepresented students)," Lew-
is said. See STUDENTS, page 17

Continued from page 16 

Shoon Lio is a research intern who 
examines the feaSibility of implementing a 
department of ethnic studies into the 
UCSD course curriculum. "We have an 
Institute of the Americas, the various area 
studies like Chi nese Studies, a Pacific Rim 
Graduate School and now Fifth College, 
with its emphasis on international con-

cerns, and there isn't a component in any 
of these programs that deals with im-
migration to this COUntry or with ethnic 
Americans on campus," Lio said. 

An obstacle that Lio is faced with in his 
work is making the administration believe 
that ethnic studies is not only a valid 
course of study, but one whi c h will be 
inrerestlng to students as well. After all the 
implem~ntation of an ethnic studies pro-
gram Will come down 10 a question of 
whether the administration will provide 
the funds for it or not. 

Lio equates the European im migrat ion 
to America with the Vietnamese and Mexi-
can immigrants of today. "People forget 
that when you study theJewish intellectuals 
or the I ri sh III Boston that it's a form of 
ethnic studies, And now it's nOt quite as 
vahd to study Chi anos or Mexican-Am. 
encans," Lio said. 

"History repeats itself, so we need LO get 
a clearer sense of background ," LIO added. 

A clearer sense of background is crucial to 
SAAC because it's the first step towards a 
clearer sense of future . As it is, Ramirez 
stated, "( underrepresented) students don't 
see all the paths they ca n go." 

Stacy Lo'::':;;;U:c;,;,~ 
The student interns stand 
outside the SAAC office where 
they pursue their research. 

"We (SAAC) are 
a resource to other 
students and clubs 
helping them find 
the resources to 
keep them going 
at UCSD,"

The ( he was started by the

campus organizations that worked 
together without administrative 
funding and bureaucracy. Accord-
ing to Spalding, the location of the 
Che used 10 be a coffee house back 
when UCSD was a graduate school. 
The plans for a vegetarian restaur-
ant grew from that sce ne 

When the unive rsity adminis-

met with favorable response. For 
in~tance , there have been disa-
greements about accounts and pay-
roll , "only because we work it out 
differently," Spalding said . Spalding 
also worked as the C he's book-
keeper for two years. "We have a 
worker's collective and the income 
generated here needs to be put 
back into that." 

"We're unique because of 
our food and atmosphere, 
Vegetarian food is labor 
intensive," 

-Sue Spalding 
A Che employee 

She also noted that the admin-
istrati on rules that the University 
Events Office should be involved 
in the Che programming, like con-
ce rts or dinnners. However, that 
on ly adds to the expenses for the 
Che when their own workers can 
handle security or technical mat-
ters at no extra cost. 

"Like any authority, the adminis-
trati on is far removed from the 
actual operation. The poliCies are 
selectively enforced ," 
Spalding said . "It all goes back to 
'self-determination. ", 

However, for the most part, she 
sees "long-standing, enthusiastic 
support rrom students and fa culty . 
The Che has been through rough 
times-- but for every person who 
does nOt co me here for whatever 
reason, there are always other 
people. This place is a bridge 
between the univers ity and the 
community," 

Pam Middings. a Che worker [or 
the past six months. commented, 
"This place reminds me of Berkeley. 
It's a break from the mainstream." 
On herway to cut vegetables in rhe 
Che's kitchen, she remarked. ' Work-
in, here ... there's a big feeling of 
belonging."

Cheap land, competition and the confederacy 
By ROBERT LEONE 
SklJfWril6 

Holy smokes! It all adds up to the birth of the UC 
Welcome to UCSD. Like to know 

when it aU began? 
1868. NearOakland. ThaI's where 

the UC got its stan. Originally a 
Presbyterian-Congregationalist 
prep school called The Contra 
Costa Academy, this institution 
was re-chartered as the University 
of California in 1868 as a smclly 
non-denominational public school 
In 1870, it wem co-cd. 

The motive for this move was 
land granted to California by the 
federal 1862 Morrill Acl. This act 
gave every state 30,000 acres of 
public land for each senator and 
representative they had in Wash-
ington. States would then sell the 

land to fund new colleges to leach 
fannrrs and mechanics how to do 
their increasingly technical jobs. 

Thr UC wasn't the first public 
college in California. The State 

ormal School. whose origins (in-
cluding its ClHducational tradition) 
stretch back to 1857 , was in opera-
tion teaching would-be teachers 
how to teach. A teachers' college 
was a brave move when only 22 
percent of California's children at-
tended school. This school is the 
direct ancestor of San Jose State 
University. 

California had the land. wh ile 
the Contra Costa Academy had the 
teachers. some buildings. and a 

history of extensive lobbying for 
public funds and recognition des-
pite its religious origi ns. After the 
initial difficulties about the sep-
aration of churh and state. and a 
few decades of co nfUSion about 
whose land was where and why 
some buildings had immense cost 

aged $5. 17 an acre for its federally 
gramed land. instead of the national 
average of only $1 .65 an acre. The 
UC started rich . but spent money 
lavishly on buildings and salaries. 

The Morrill Act was Signed by 
Abraham Lincoln. and the first 
choice for president of the UC was 

The U.S. Army Signal Corps took over 
Davis in 1942. They gave it back when 
World War II was over. 

overruns. the take-over worked fair-
ly well . 

Thanks to the shrewdness of the 
origi nal Regents. Californ ia aver-

Union General George McClellan, 
twice commander of the Army of 
the Potomac (he refused the UC 
job). It is ironic that thc first two 

professors the UC hired were form-
er Confederacy officials. John 
LeContc. the first physics professor 
the UC eve r had , was superimen-
dent of the Confederate govern-
ment's Nitre and Mining Bureau. 
He later became a UC presidem. 

His brother, a chemist for the 
same agency. was appoimed profes-
sor of geology. botany and natural 
history. The UCs third professor 
had barely missed being executed 
by Union General George Burnside 
for spying during the Civil War. 

Thc LeCome brothers published 
threc research papers in 1871 , the 
year after they were hired . Despite

tradition as a research schooL How-
ever. it would be decades before 
the UC beca me renowned for its 
research . 

So this is the origins of the UC at 
Berkeley. Eventually it spread out. 

Between 1881 and 1907, Los 
Angeles' population grew from 
11 .000 to 350,000. In 1881 , L.A. 
had been given a teachers college, 
but soon the town boosters wanted 
more. The Normal schools could 
offer four-year degree programs in 
teaching and two-year degrees in 

whatever they wanted to. but that 
wasn 't good enough for L.A. The 
growing southland population de-
sired a full college. not one deSigned 
only for prospective teachers. Also. 
rhey wanted the state 10 fund it. 

The UC. always paranoid about 
In-state public college competition, 
was eventually cajoled into taking 
over the local teacher's college as a 
U.c. branch in 1919. By 1926. it 
had become the University of Calif-
ornia at Los Angeles, and. in that 
year. it moved to Westwood. About 
the sa me time, the old UC campus 
up north became known as UC 

It was 100 late . however. to pre-
vent the UC from haVing eo m-
petition. ln 1935. the state teachers' 
schools. then called State Teachers' 
Colleges. were allowed to take the 
"Teachers" out of their name and 
offer four-year degrees in whatever 
departments they could get accred-
ited. Nowadays. the state syste m 
even offers Masters degrees, and 
some Ph.Os in programs associated 
with UCs.

Birth of the UC 
Continued from page 25 

al sc hools III th e Uc. ilt Berkeley 
and L.A. There were colleges of 
agriculture in DaVIS and Ri ve rside 
proressionnl schools in an Fran.' 
cisco (UCSF). the Lick Astronom-
ical Departlllcnt (on Mount Hamil-
ton along the rim or ilicon Valley). 
and the Scripps In mute of Ocean-
ography ( 10) (established as a 
permanent research station in 
1912). 

However. the UC was slowly 
expanding th e courses at DaVIS. in 
part to fight ort agricultumlillterests 
which wnnted 10 rake over the 

~ch ool as a ~crarate state college or 
ngriculture (reme mber, the UC was 
paranoid ). But the U.S Army Signal 
Corps took o\'er Davis III 1942. 
They gave it back when World War 
11 was over. 

Sinking back against the stalC 
colleges. tbe UC in 1944 took over 
Sarna Barbara State Collegc. then 
the most highly regarded of the 
schools. 

UCI was established after the 
war when the Irvine Company 
granted a thousand acres to the 

UC 
The agricultural colleges and re -

seJrc h tations at Davi s and R iver-
side (c itrus being a specialty) were 
expanded into full UC branches, 

This is the essentia l rormula for 
the UCs campus construction me -
thods, The Regents prefer to build 
where they already have huge am-
ountS or land holdings (UC Davis 
and UC Rivers ide began as ag-
ricultural research stations and rarm-
ers colleges). or where Ihey can ger 
land real cheap. perferably donated. 
If possible . they will take over 
anot her school so they won't hdve 
t() bUild as much. 

Thus. UC5 D came aboul when 
the Rege nts. through then 510 d l-
rec[()r Roger Revellc's Nnvy comacts. 
got the Pentagon [0 give up a 
Marine base called Camp Matthews. 
for a cheap price, in the 1960s. 
Right next [0 the already existing 
510 was the perfect site for a 
science and technology IIlstitute to 
supportSIO. However, Revelle plan-
ned for. an gOt. a rull university. 
worthy of the UC label. And that's 
how it began.

UCSD's firsl full-time SpOrts inform-
ation director. 

The role of SpOrts Information 
dlreclor was preVIously divided 
bewtween twO people; Judy Ma-
lone women's basketball coach. 
and Laurel Dean V,' nh Gan-
non devoting hIS complete ,men-
tion to the po ilion It would only 
seem likely thallhe Job wIll be well 
done. Many UnIversities and col-
lege , smaller and larger than L'C D.

Gannon defme~ hIS Jobas ha\lng 
twO parts. spons Inlormatlon and 
promotion. He IS responSible for 
relaying spotts-related information 
to people outside of campus; the 
print and electronic media, AII-
American and team ranking com-
mittees, the general community, 
and all the opposing teams. HIS 
promotion is geared toward UCSD 
students and faculty and the sur-
rounding community 

Prior to Joining Ihe UCSD athletic 
department staff. Gannon was the 
sPOttS information director at RegiS 
College, a small Jesuit school In 
Colorado. 

Gannon 28. spent most of hiS 
youlh In Iowa After graduallng 
from high school, he became a 
sPOrts wnter for a small newspaper. 
HIS beat was largely local hIgh 
school and college spons His Inrer-

est In sPOrtS wrillng was due in 
pan ro his own experience on the 
high school baseball ream which 
he had considered pursuing. 

DeCidIng rhar a high school dip-
loma Just wasn'~nough , Gannon 
chose to attend Cal Lutheran Uni-

also hke the benefits of a state 
University." Due [0 the rising costs 
of tuition at pnvate ins titutions, it 
IS becoming increaSingly difficult 
to pay the faculty and [0 guarantee 
their Jobs, Gannon aid . 

Gannon i confident that the 
UCSD athletic program will con-
tinue to grow and nOUrish thiS year 
"Our attend an e figures are low

Women's v-ball takes tourney 
Take top spot after defeatin Elmhurst in 5 

By KURT BELL Sla!!Wrilu 

"[t was unbelie\'ably exciti ng It 
had all the ingredie nts of a national 
championshIp final ," saId UCSD 
women's volleyball coach Doug Dan-
nevik after the Tritons defeated #1 
ra nked Elmhurst in five games 
Saturday ntght. 

The VICtory gave the Tritons 
both the MIzuno - UCSD tourna-
ment victory and put them at the 
lOp in the national rankings. 

Dannevik equated the match to 
a pnze fight. Both teams battled 
back and forth for two hours 25 
mmutes. responded to each others 
blows and, at the conclUSIOn, dIS-
played the exhaustIon of such a 
contesl . 

L C. D took an early lead by 
winning the first twO games 15-7 
and IS-II , Elmhurst. how\:\'er, 
fought ItS way back by poundmg 
UC 0 2-15 in the thIrd game and 
overcame an 8-2 deficit in the 
founh to wm 14-16. 

[n the deciding game, UCSD 
took an 8-2 lead but Elmhurst once 
agai n was able to battle back and 
tie the score 11-11 . However, UCSD 
warded off the flurry to take the 
game 15-11. 

Da nnevik said senIOr janet 
Hughes (mIddle blocker) and Carol 
Lipson (seuer) played exceptionally 
well but it was the passing and serv-
ing of Junior Ellen Chi (outSIde 
hiller) that applied the final blows 
to Elmhurst. 

Dann·evik said hIS team is plaYing 
\ery steady and tough. "A lot of 
teams will fold when opponents 
keep figh lmg back hke Ihat ," he 
saId . "but we keep staying tough. 

"Last year we had a cenaln team 
character we found ways to wtn 
ThIS year we are developmg that 
, .lIne ~on of character." 

The weekend's VIClOrteS pushed 
the Tritons record to 11-2. 6-0 in 
Dl\'lsion 1lI play and one step 
closer to another nallonal champion-
ship. Dannevik saId the tcam IS 
ahead of schedule. "We're gelllng 
great leadersh Ip from the senior 
players, there is a team harmony. 
RIght now they're dOing everythi ng 
they're asked to do. There is not 
one negative." 

Actually one negative did come 
OU t of Saturday'S last match. Senior 
Jennifer Pettigrew went down with 
a sprained ankle and will be out 
two to four weeks. 

In other tournament matches 
during the past week, UCS D de-
fea ted Colorado College 15-10, 15-
8 and 15-11 and LaVerne 15-4 , 
[5-[ 1 and [59. 

TntonJanet Hughes puts a spike down agamst LaVerne. 

UCSD placed first in the tour-
nament, Elmhurst second, Colo-
rado College third and La Verne 
last. 

Hughes was awarded the tour-

team as well as Michelle Greaves 
and Therese Dorigan from Elm-
hurst and Elissa Brellbard from 
Colorado College.

" Last year we had a certain team 
character, we found ways to win, This 
year we are developing that same 
sort of character."

Wed nesday. 
they will be home Friday for the 

annual alumni game and play Chap-
man Saturday night, anorher tough 
match for Dannevik and his Tritons. 

Commentary An open letter to the NFL 
Gentleman , let's stop thiS non-

sense and get back to the trenches 
I've already gone wllhout pro foot-
ball for some elghl days now I 
don't know how I'll get through 
Monday ntght. Sorry, I gel no kIcks 
from collegiate foOtball. Never have 
for some reason, although Kwh 
Jackson may have had somethmg 
to do with it 

With pro football , 1 have a sense 
of personal hiStory. I don't remem-
ber the date of my first kiss, but I 
reme mber It was San Diego at 
Kansas lly Lan I' Alworth. Joe 
Namath , Tom Landry, How-uhd 
Co-sell -they've all played major 
roles in my Falls and Winters since 
childhood . 

Most of II seems ltke anuent 
history now but Ihere have been 
player walkouts 10 the past [don't 
recaUthe NFL strikes of 1968 and 
1970. [n 1974, [ do remember that 
a bunch of non-Iuminartes played 
10 the Hall of Fame game 

The str1ke of 1982 does remain 
fresh 10 my memory. the players 
held out for 55 percent of the gross 
revenues from the NFL turnstiles 
and TV rights and the owners saId

Slumps are commonplace in

• • though money is always an issue . and indeed, is he re , there is also 
the deeper. even noble cause of 
human dignity. That is. the same 
right you and I have to change jobs 
in our chosen professions for a 
better opportunity. The conective 
barga ining agreement that JUSt 
expired is, arguably, a form of 
indentured servitude from the 
moment a player signs his first 
contract. 

Free agancy. such as it is in 
football . dictates that a player can 
market himself to a new team, but 
that his old team can match the 
offer. This is known as ' first-refusar 
and allows the old team to retain 
the player. If the new team tops the 
old team's highest bid , and signs 
t he player. they have to compensate 
the old team with valuable draft 
choices. 

The Union wants to abolish the 
practice of first-refusal for players 
with four years experie nce and 
have unrestricted free agancy. such 
as baseball has. Tht' club would 
retain first-refusa l on players with 
less than four years. In a ny event, 
no compe nsation could be de-
manded for signing any free agent. 

Regardless of their grasp of the 
Bill of Rights, the NFL owners as a . 
group do not want free agency.Just 
last week an arbitrator found that 
baseball owners had been in col-
lusion to restrict free agency in 
1985. More than one football owner 
may have been thinking, There but 
for the grace of God go I: They've 
had it their way for so long, they're 
resistant to change. They merely 
offer to lessen compensation. On 
the issue of free agency, the owners 
and players are miles apart. Believe 
me, if it weren't for this, Hank 
Kissinger could patch up the strike 
over lunch. 

If the strike juggernaut gains 
momentum for a lengthy stay. we 
can expect NFL owners to peddle 
us 'scab .l(ames' in whic h 'has-
beens,'not-quites: and other'walk-
ns' from the NFL's past resume 
the schedule . 1 he uniforms and 
stadiums at least will be the same, 
and maybe it will provide mindless 
filler and background drone in 
bars until the real NFL comes back. 
If Bogus Football lasts, say, seven 
weeks. powerhouses like the Bears 
and Raiders could be looking at 2-7 
records thanks to the ineptness of 
their scabbies. Conversely. per-
ennially whipped 'dogs' like New 
Orleans and Buffalo could end up 
8-1 and in the driver's seat for an 
invitation to Pete Rozelle's post-
season pany (Sorry, I've always 
loved that cliche). 

Hell , the owners may even be 
prepared to go all the way with the 
scabs. Next January, John Elway.

all. Because you type your work on a 
screen before you print it on a page. 

It edits, 
And how about those bigger problems 

like wanting to rearrange paragraphs" 
On an ordinary typewriter you have to "cut and 

paste" them. , 
On a Videowriter you only have to press the key 

marked "move" and then indicate the area you want 
it moved to. It 's Ihat simple. 

It speDs. 
What happens when you 're typing and you come 

to a word you can't spell? 
On an ordinary typewriler you have to stop typing, 

find a dict ionary and look it up. 
Not so on a Videowriter. Spell ing problems can be 

corrected simply by pressing the key marked "spell." 
It counts words. 
If you 've ever had a teacher tell you to write a 

thousand word essay, you know what a pain it i 
trying to counl your words. 

On an ordinary typewriter you have to do it wi th 
your finger. 

But on a Videowriter you can press a mere two 

buttons and it does the counting for you . 
It makes multiple copies. 
From time to time you wanl a copy of 

what you've typed, right? 
Well, if you use a Videowriter you won't 
have to go to the school library to look 

for a copier machine. 
All you'll have to look for is the 
button marked "print:' Press it 
and the Videowriter will make 
another original. 
And because your work is auto-

make those copies

a lot more than type. 
That's because th e word pro-

What's more, we sell the Videowriter Word

Tritons 
Continued from pagr 19 

Davis made a run down the left 
wing, turned the defender, and 
crossed the ball over the goalie to 
another freshman , Marisa Ortiz, 
who knocked it in. 

Two minutes later, Occidental 
was called for a tripping foul in the 
penalty box. Faro nailed the penalty 
kick for her second goal and a 4-0 
San Dieg o victory . 

With the win, the Tritons are 
now 6-1 and can begin the count-
down. 

UCSD has ten scheduled games 
remaining before the NCAA Region-
als. "If we keep beating Division 1II 
teams , we will make :,he playoffs ," 

oach McManus said, after the 
game. The next, test is here at 
UCSD against a good U.s. interna-
!lonal team on October 6. 

Occidental managed to remain 
within striking distancc of victory 
during Friday's game until the Tri-
ton bench began to asscrt itself. So 
number nine is for Mari a Ortiz 
(who also wears no. 9) and the rest 
of thc ubstitutes. Ortiz scored the 
third goal, which eliminiated Oc-
cidental's chances for a win . 

umber eight is a tribute to the 
defen e. It was not until the eighth 
minute (after the score was 1-0) 
that Occidental managed their first 
shot. Due to a tremendous defense 
effort , the Triton held Occidental 
to less than eight shots throughout 
the game. 

Conversely, the Tritons' first goal 

came in the seve nth minute 01 th e 
first hJlf. Mauro also got her seventh 
goal in seven games. he IS the 
team's leading scorer 

This was the sixth win in ,1 row 
for CSD. Despite losing six seniors 
to gradua tion, the team remains in 
contentIon. 

They are curren tly ranked no. 5 
in a nati onwide poll. Not only do 
they have a winning streak, but 
they have won the last five by 
shutout. 

With the defense keeping the 
goals away, the offensive scoring 
becomes key. Four goals a game is 
enough to beat anybody when the 
defense does its job. 

The team is looking to improve 
on last year's third place finish . 
Coach McManus fires them up by 
screaming "Second best, second 
best'" 

It works. At thi s rate , they just 
might be yelling back "We're it II " 

Brian McManus gives some helpful pointers during halftime last Friday. 

Men's soccer 
Continued from page 30 
the back of the net has hurt them 
dearly and the)' need to break out 
of their scoring drought soon. 

Brian McManus, who coached 
the leam in Derek Armstrong's 
absen e couldn't believe the luck of 
his TritOns. He said, "They (Biola) 
gOt one bloody shot and it denected 
off a defender. That's how OUT 
whole season's gone ... we need to 
get some goals." 

In spite of their inability to 
score, the Tritons have impressed 
their opponents. They've domi-
naled games by playing strong 
defense and constantly keeping 
their opponents off balance with 
their comrolled passing game. 

Azusa Pacific coach Don law-
rence stated , "PhYSically and ath-
letically UCSD is very strong. They 
are a well-coached group. If they 
continue to play the way they are, 
they will do well in the playoffs." 

Of course, they will need to 
score some more goals if they are to 
get that far. Defender Mike Bradley 
tried to answer the riddle of the 
slump wilh , "We don't have the 
one guy willing to stick his head in 
to finish the goals. We need to find 
someone willing to do that." . 

Agreeing, mid fielder Mike Kapp 
said, "last year we had a lot of 
returning players ... guys'who knew 
how (0 finish what they staned. 

SCOtt Rommel misses a scoring 
opportunity by a head against Oc-
cidental. . 

score some goals. When that 
happens we're going to go a long 
ways." 

Biola coach Matt Orr summed 
up the TritOns' emire season with , 
·One shot. That's how the game 
goes. They controlled the game but 
we gOt the goal that coumed. 

_____________________________________ --, This year we don't have anyone 10 
do that yet." Still, he is optimistic 
that they will break out of Ihis 
slump. "I think that one day we're 
going to go out there and every-
thing's goi ng to click. We're going 
to start putting things tOgether and 

Like lawrence, Orr was im-
pressed by the overall play of the 
Tritons, "They kept pressure up 
until the end. It shows they're well 
coached ... They will do well in the 
future ." 

... If only they could score some 
goals.

Padres 
Continued from page 33 
with Mark McGwire for the Oakland 
Athletics first base job, Nelson won 
the spring training battle and Mc-
Gwire watched as the A's struggled 
through the ftrst couple of weeks of 
the season. Tony LaRussa, the A's 
manager, decided OUt of despera-
tion to make some switches, one of 
those being McGwire takmg over 
Nelson's pos itlon. The rest. as they 
say, is hIstory, with McGwire now 
the sure AL Rookie of the Year 
wmner, and a depressed Nelson 
baiting .215 in Tnple A (minor 
leagues) for the rest of the season. 

elson has the potential to be a 
power hitter, which the Padres 
desperately need, and the glove to 
play in the big leagues, so he is a 
legitimate candidate in the close 
race for the first. 

Between the corners lie two of 
the more troublesome positions for 
the Padres - second base and 
shortstop. Joey Cora, Randy Ready, 
and Tim Flannery have all played 
second for decent stretches of time, 
with Ready having the best bat 
(.304) and Cora the worst glove. 
But Cora, who was tabbed as the 
starting second baseman in the be-
ginning of the season and was sem 
to the minors after a rocky start, is 
improving steadily in the fielding 
departmem, and hit .276 while In 
Las Vegas (the Triple A Padre 
affiliation). Randy Ready, once, as 
BillJames writes, "the sh inmg star 
of the Milwaukee farm system," has 
proven on e and for all he can play 
profeSSional baseball at ItS highest 
level. 28 years old, Ready hit .308, 
.329, .375, and 376 in the minors, 
but was ne\'er given a decent chance 
to provc hIS worth as a member of 
thc Brew Crew Over la t wimer, 
the Padres traded Tom Plsnarsk, 
to Milwaukee for Ready, and the 
new man 1 n San Dtego has hit 0 er 
.300, Iteklcd quite well, and has 
shown he can do the Job. Tim 
Flannery, a an Diego favorite, ma), 
be a hot surfer but he's not much 
more than a utility baseball player. 

At shortstop is the once bTilliant 
Garry Templeton, acqUired a few 
years ago from the St. Louis Cardin-
als for the now brilliant Ozzie 
Smith. After a rough slart in the 
hitting department thIS year, Temp-
leton has ' improved' his average to 
a team low (among starters) .228, 
and occaSionally 'bobbles the ball' 
after stopping a grounder, thus 
missing many double play oppor-
tunities. Maybe hIS new glasses will 
help. 

In the outfield , only one man's 
job is safe, that of the incomparable 
Tony Gwynn. Gwynn is leading all 
of baseball with a .369 batting av-
erage, has hit 36 doubles, 13 triples, 
stolen 55 bases, and scored 117 
runs. A fine fielder with a very good 
arm, Gwynn was once described 
by manager Larry Bowa as "as close 
to a perfect player the re IS." Center 
field IS filled by one of the fa test 
men in ba eball , tanJefferson, but 
other than that he is as far from 
be i ng a pe rfect player as Gwyn n 1 
close to being one. Jefferson hits 
only .236, and hi> greatest natural 
attrlbutc IS one that most quickl)'

"I want the student leaders in the

program. but also to know that we 
are an outlet for their students. 

"My goal is to make intercollegiate 
athletics, for players and spectators, 
part of the overall college exper-
ience," Gannon said . 

Having joined the UCSD staff 
tn August, Gannon still plans to do 
a lot of evaluating of the athletic 
program before making any specific 
moves or changes. He is anxious to 
attend the games to gel a feel for 
what is going on . He is aware , 
however, of some of the issues that 
UCSD students are raiSing these 
days. 

A sc hool of UCSD's size and 
caliber is not often found in Divi-
sion III of the CM. Yet, we are in 
this third diviSIOn , and. thcrefore, 
our opponents are often small ,

Prospective Discussion Leaders should

Moving up in division will not I be Gannon's deCision. Approval 

from the admlllistration will be the 
key facrol . If UCSD did \clIVe Div-

the glory 01 being the hest [e.lm In 
the division. Gannon said . 

A scholarship program would 
have to be added ifUC D chose 10

to such an endeavor. The same 
applies 10 the possibility of havi ng

the answer to everything," Gannon 
sa id . "It's very ex pensive to do II

_ UCSD athletic review Cross country with a new coach and new hopes for '87-'88 
By BRIAN now 
SIaf!Wrila 

After a successful 1986 campaign, 
the UCSD cross country team is 
hav ing to start over with a new 
coach , Mark Stanforth. Under his 
direction . the team hopes to con-
tinue its success and perhaps, qual-
ify for the season-ending Division 
III championships. 

Stanforth. an all-around athlete 
at the University of South Dakota. 
Springfield , accepted his new post 
JUSt over one month ago after co m-
piling impressive credentials, both 
as a runner and a coach . 

After running cross country track 
and playing basketball at USD-
Springfield, Stanforth entered mili -
tary service where he continued to 
run in road races. 

He then attended Northern State 
College in South Dakota, and for 
one and a half years, served as a 
graduate assistant. 

In 1980. he qualified for the 
marathon's Olympic Trials. After 
.competing in the trials , he ac-

ce pted a pos tllon as coac h of 
Glendale City College's cross coun-
try team. He served as coac h for the 
next seven years before accepting a 
similar posi tion as ucsO's cross 
country coach . 

Having just accepted his new 
post. tan forth is anxious to eval-
uate hs team's performance against 
thaI of other area school's. Since 
much of the team is JUSt arri ving at 
school, Stanforth has not been able 
to evaluate the talent of his own 
team and he is unsure what to 
expect from competing teams. 

Ilowever, based on last year's 
performance. he should have a 
team that will be very competitive 
with other Division Jll teams. A 
year ago. the women finished 5th 
in regional competition and the 
men ran very competitively. 

Stanforth is also fonunate in that 
he lost very few runners from last 
year's squad. On the women's side 
only one runner is returning though, 
two good freshmen girls are being 
added [0 the team to take her 
place. Wiw the men, essentially 

the whole team returns. In addition, 
the men will be adding one fresh-
man, one junior college transfer 
and one red shirt freshman.

meet - the Chapman Invitational
