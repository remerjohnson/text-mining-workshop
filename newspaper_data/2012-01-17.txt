Archery Team Asks Admin. for Right to Use UCSD Archery Field

BY MICHAEL CHANG
Staff Writer

Due to unspecified safety liabilities, the UCSD 
Archery team is not allowed to use the new archery 
field located next to UCSD Thornton Hospital, which 
was completed in October 2011.

The archery team was founded in 2009, but has had 
trouble in gaining members beyond its original three. 
Archery club president Stella Chen said she believes 
that one obstacle to the team’s growth is the lack of an 
on-campus practice space. 

“We’ve had issues with the administrators of the 
[Recreation] Department saying that we can’t practice 
because there are liabilities,” Chen said. “We thought 
this was strange because archery is one of the safest 
sports and no other university we know of that com-

petes competitively has this issue.” 
For example, Chen said, the archery teams of 

UCLA, UC Berkeley, and UC Irvine are able to prac-
tice on campus and have had no safety-related issues. 

Archery has been in the competitive college sports 
circuit for over 50 years. During this time, there have 
been no recorded serious injuries during practice, 
competitions, or events nationally. At UCSD, all Triton 
Archery officers must be official coaches in the U.S. 
Collegiate Archery. 

Team captain Dakota Sinclair said that the UCSD 
Sports Recreation Department has not released a 
statement explaining why archery is considered to be 
a dangerous sport.

“Archery is not a dangerous sport,” Sinclair said. 
“Most insurance companies rate it at the same level 
as they do football. By percentage of participants to 
injuries, it is a very low-risk sport.”

Director of Sports and Recreation Clubs Scott 
Berndes, however, has stated that the archery team

The San Diego Padres and Fox Regional Sports Networks 
are planning to announce a deal for a new sports network — 
Fox Sports San Diego — that will broadcast the 2012 Padres 
season. Fox Sports San Diego may also cut deals with UCSD, 
San Diego State, USD, Cal State San Marcos and Point Loma 
Nazarene. The deal will also give the Padres partial ownership 
of the network. 

The long-term TV deal with Fox Sports is expected to pay 
the Padres roughly $17 to $22 million per season. The team 

will receive advertising dollars from the network in exchange 
for allowing Fox Sports San Diego to broadcast its games 
exclusively. 

Fox Sports Network has hired Senior Vice President of 
Fox Sports Ohio Henry Ford as president and general man-
ager of the new network. It is currently in talks with the COX 
Communications Channel 4 studios — outside Petco Park — 
to use the station facilities.

The team’s previous deal with Cox Communications 
Channel 4 paid the Padres $11 million per season. Channel

Scientist Uses Mirror Therapy to “Trick” Phantom Limbs
BY SARAH KANG
Staff Writer

UCSD professor Vilayanur S. Ramachandran has 
created a system using mirrors to treat the phantom 
limb syndrome.

Since the 1990s, Ramachandran has been study-
ing mirror neurons, which fire when one person acts 
and when another person performs the same action, 
and phantom limbs, which cause patients to feel 
sensations within amputated limbs. Ninety percent of 
amputees have this syndrome, and many who have it 
experience chronic pain. 

Ramachandran hypothesized that if mirror neu-
rons fired when an individual saw someone else 
moving an arm, such a visual perception could create 
a sensory conflict within the brain that could actually 
help someone who has a phantom limb. He then dis-
covered that an amputee patient missing his left arm 
could look at a mirror image of his right arm moving 
to relieve pain in his phantom limb.

“I tell my medical colleagues that it is the first 
example in the history of medicine of successful 
amputation of a phantom limb,” Ramachandran said.

Ramachandran used mirrors to confuse the 
brain’s sensory perceptions, experimenting with 
visual perception on phantom limb patients. He had 
a patient who constantly felt as if his phantom hand 

was tightly clenched, move his intact hand right next 
to a mirror, creating a mirror image of that hand. 
Seeing the mirror image made the mirror neurons 
in the patient fire, and the patient felt like his miss-
ing hand was making the same motions as his intact 
hand.

“One way the brain deals with conflict is to say, 
‘To hell with it! There is no arm,’ and the arm disap-
pears,” Ramachandran said in the Dec. 5, 2011 BBC 
News article “What phantom limbs and mirrors teach 
us about the brain.”

Ramachandran’s first osteoarthritis patient was 
a man who lost an arm while crossing the Mexican 
border to enter the U.S. The man had a constant itch 
in his missing left hand, and when Ramachandran 
used a cotton bud to touch his cheek, he claimed to 
feel it in his missing thumb. The neurons that once 
detected sensation in the missing hand were instead 
detecting sensation in the face. From this discovery, 
Ramachandran created the theory that brain mod-
ules are not separate from each other and can adapt 
to new situations and environments.

Along with mirror therapy, Ramachandran has 
proved his theory that mirror neurons help us under-
stand not only our own body movements, but also 
those of others. He discovered that simply observing 
someone else massaging his or her own hand can 
provide relief to patients suffering from osteoarthri-

tis. Ramachandran believes that these neurons are at 
the core of how human beings are able to empathize 
with one another.

Ramachandran is Director of the Center for Brain 
and Cognition at UCSD and has been a Professor 
Emeritus since 2009. His most recent research focus-
es on synesthesia and why certain people can have 
perceptual experiences such as hearing colors and 
tasting words.

members cannot use the field, and that the only official 
use is reserved for students enrolled in the recreational 
class.

“They told us we can’t use the field unless we are out 
there as a student as one of their [recreational] classes,” 
team member Chris Cheng said. “When we noticed that 
the new field was being built, we asked again and Berndes 
told us the same thing.”

The team has attempted to Berndes multiple times 
since February 2009 regarding access to the field, but 
have not been successful. In addition to unspecified 
safety concerns, the team was told that another reason 
access is barred is because the recreation department 
cannot compete with a student organization offering 
free archery training. The team has also been required to 
change its status from a recreational club to a social club 

due to policies stating that to recreational clubs must use 
on-campus facilities.

Members had an initial meeting with Assistant 
Vice Chancellor of Student Wellness Karen Calfas in 
November 2011, but Calfas has not spoken with them 
since.

“I’ve had one meeting with the Archery student [orga-
nization] president,” Calfas said. “We are looking into 
options now and I hope to be meeting with them soon.”

Chen is still trying to contact Calfas to continue dis-
cussing the issue, but until the situation is resolved, the 
team practices at either the Balboa Park Archery Range 
or Lake Poway Archery Range to maintain its position as 
the No. 1 team on the west coast.

Berndes could not be reached for comment.

confirmed April 21, 2011 that it would not retain the rights 
to broadcast Padres games in 2012.

Fox Sports San Diego will broadcast through all cable, 
satellite and telecommunication providers so that the 
games will be available to a wider audience. The Padres are 
expected to benefit from the broadcasting revenue earned 
through the larger audience. Prior to this deal, the Padres 
HAD been broadcasting through Cox Communication’s 
Channel 4, which was made available to Cox and Time 
Warner subscribers, leaving DirectTV, AT&T U-verse and 
Dish Network without Padres coverage for most of the 
season. 

The network will broadcast other Southern California

Mighty Ducks, which are normally shown on Fox Sports 
Prime Ticket. Fox Sports Prime Ticket, a Los Angeles-
based Regional Sports Network, can only be viewed in San 
Diego through AT&T U-verse and Time Warner Cable.

Fox Sports Network is the largest RSN provider in the 
nation; it broadcasts 66 of the 81 U.S. professional sports

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  TUESDAY, JANUARY 17,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

The same show that has been teaching children how to count for over 
four decades may be bringing back 
controversial clips on breastfeeding. 
This public television show, Sesame 
Street, is overstepping its boundaries and 
unnecessarily creating controversy by 
considering educating toddlers on this 
topic.

Breastfeeding has been a contentious 
topic for years, even in relation to much 
older audiences. Just this past year, a 
Michigan judge ruled that a woman could 
not breastfeed her child during court 
proceedings. Facebook banned photos of 
women breastfeeding in 2009, citing that 
such photos violated their decency code. 
This December, a woman who was nursing 
her infant at a Target store in Texas was 
asked by employees to finish breastfeeding 
in a fitting room, as she was making other 
customers feel uncomfortable.

The program should take a hint 
from this public outcry and omit any 
presentation of breastfeeding. If people 
don’t want women breastfeeding at the 
local Target, they are hardly likely to 
support a Sesame Street segment on the 
act. Sesame Street currently appears on the 
television screens of millions of children 
in over 150 countries, meaning that the 
episodes must be focused on subjects that 
are widely supported. The issue is too 
touchy for Sesame Street to tackle at this 
time. 

Breastfeeding has been almost 
completely removed from the public eye, 
and there is no reason to spark controversy 
by highlighting it on one of the nation’s 
most widely viewed children’s shows.

QUICK TAKES AN ONLINE PETITION CALLS ON THE CHILDREN’S PROGRAM SESAME STREET TO FEATURE A LESSON ON BREASTFEEDING TO NORMALIZE THE PRACTICE IN THE PUBLIC EYE.  

A petition entitled “Bring Breastfeeding Back to Sesame Street” recently jumped from about 
10,000 signatures last week to 28,000 signatures 
on Sunday. The creators of this petition wish to 
“normalize breastfeeding in our community,” and 
complain that Sesame Street has not promoted 
breastfeeding since the 80s.  This is an opportunity 
for Sesame Street to teach children about a natural, 
healthy and normal part of life in a tasteful way. 

 As an educational program, it is Sesame Street’s 
goal to explain different aspects of life to children. 
Breastfeeding is certainly a common, natural part 
of life. In 2008 the Center for Disease Control 
conducted a phone survey about breastfeeding, 
and 74.6 percent of mothers who responded said 
they had breastfed their child at least once. Sesame 
Street would be fulfilling its mission by including 
lessons about breastfeeding in its program.

 Breastfeeding might also have real health 
benefits as well. Various research and studies from 
the Department of Health and Human Services 
have concluded that certain nutrients only found in 
breast milk are crucial to the proper development 
of a baby’s immune system. By exposing kids to 
breastfeeding, Sesame Street has an opportunity 
to promote something that could be a vital health 
concern for babies.

An aspect of Sesame Street breastfeeding 
that may concern parents is the perception 
of bare breasts being shown on a children’s 
program.  Sesame Street kept the scene G-rated 
in past episodes, it is reasonable to assume they 
would continue to treat the topic with sensitivity 
today.  Plus, breastfeeding is discreet and natural; 
there is nothing particularly damaging about 
witnessing it.  

Promoting breastfeeding on Sesame Street 
could be beneficial to society, but there are other 
concerns in the world that are probably more wor-
thy of our focus.

 CHRIS ROTELIUK
Contributing Writer

The Public Broadcasting Service show Sesame Street is made to educate youngsters on 
anything from arithmetic to vocabulary. A recent 
online petition demands that the program teach 
kids about breastfeeding. While it is important 
to keep children informed, educating children 
on topics involving reproductive anatomy should 
avoid the airwaves and be taught at a parent’s 
discretion.

Breastfeeding is something all kids eventually 
learn about, but parents have the right to be 
the deciders of when, how, and from whom 
their children learn about it. The Fourteenth 
Amendment grants parents the fundamental 
liberty to direct the education and upbringing 
of their children in whichever way they deem 
proper, which is especially pressing in matters 
of sexual education. Mothers can normalize the 
act of breastfeeding to their children without a 
TV show’s help, such as by nursing infants at 
home in the presence of older siblings. Shoving 
the burden of discussing breastfeeding onto a 
children’s program is insensitive to parents who 
wish to wait.

Furthermore, the proponents of the petition 
compose a loud minority. Parents do not 
generally call for TV shows to teach their children 
about other complex issues such as the differences 
between boys and girls, where babies come from 
and religion. While these topics may occasionally 
be discussed on TV, parents trust that Sesame 
Street will present wholesome educational 
material to their children. It is the role of parents 
— and not a TV show — to guide kids through 
the challenging experience of learning about such 
controversial topics.

When it comes to educating youngsters, 
parents ought to let Sesame Street stick to what it 
knows best — counting and spelling — and leave 
grown-up topics like breastfeeding to grown-ups.

A Decision for Parents to Make Cause of  Unnecessary ControversyEpisode Can Bring Public Acceptance

It’s always a gloomy day when a beloved Internet meme reaches its peak of overexposure. We 
know the drill by now: in exchange 
for roughly five days of reliable 
entertainment, the almighty web 

promises a million laughless Twitter 
imitators (“Single Twink Problems,” 
“White Girl Problems”) and at least as 
many illiterate YouTube comments, 
which always seem precisely worded 
to forecast the fall of mankind. 

The apparent passing this week 
of Shit Girls Say — a satirical Twitter 
account-cum-YouTube-sensation 
written by two Canadian dudes — 
struck me as particularly premature, 
though. Approximately one-third as 
annoying as nyan cat and twice as 
inventive as feminist Ryan Gosling, 
Shit Girls Say looked like it might 
have real staying power. The premise 
is exactly as simple as you’d think: 140 
characters or less of too-real musings 
on friendship, romance and low-cal 
brownies, most often served with just-
right helpings of passive aggression 
and/or whininess. Sample Tweets 
include: “What if we did a bake 
sale?”; “Love you like a sister!”; “Dark 
chocolate is really good for you”; and, 
out of obvious necessity, “Rude.”

Buzz gradually built for the Twitter 
account, and so followed a short series 
of (presumably ongoing) YouTube 
shorts that catapulted the meme to 
near-Rebecca Black levels of ubiquity. 
Then, faster than you can say “orange 
mocha frappuccino,” the inevitable 
happened: everybody else caught on. 

In a matter of hours, Shit Girls 
Say gave way to Shit Asian Girls Say 
gave way to Shit Armenian Girls Say 
gave way to Shit Black Girls Say gave 
way to Shit Black Gays Say — and 
here, I estimate, we’ve reached the 
ultimate jumping of the shark: Sh*t 
Homophobic People Say, which is 
basically just a depressing string of 
sound bites from the likes of Rick 
Perry and Michele Bachmann on 
the sneaky little devil that is the gay 
agenda. (Also, note the asterisk — 
once you’ve been censored, you know 
the fun is over). 

One little nugget of redemption 
in this deliberately unfunny 
bastardization of the original? It gives 
us an excuse to revisit that recent anti-
gay campaign ad of Perry’s — you 
know, the one where he’s dressed like 
Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain.

I have to confess that the 
reason I’m so sad to see the meme’s 
impending fade into irrelevance is 
that, frankly, it hit a little too close to 
home. I’m not a girl, but the Twitter 
feed reads like a transcript of some 
of the more asinine questions I’ve 
asked of friends, or coworkers, or the 
universe: “I don’t snore, do I?”; “Are 
you busy tonight?”; “How is mercury 
not in retrograde right now?” 

I can only hope that in its 
inevitable disappearance — barring 
a book or sitcom deal, a la Shit My 
Dad Says — the reminder to switch 
up my smalltalk will somehow live on, 
whether through watching those three 
famed YouTube clips or searching my 
browser history to relive the glory 
days. (Just kidding — who does that?)

Shit Girls 
Say: Is the 
Joke Seriously 
Over Already?

Stuck in the Middle
UC Berkeley is the first in the UC system to announce a financial aid program to assist 

middle class students — a promising plan that is too ambitious to implement UC-wide at 
this time. By Chelsey Davis • Staff  Writer

As college tuition fees continue to climb far beyond what many can afford, more and more 
middle-income families are forced to 
make tough decisions about higher 
education. However, UC Berkeley has 
a solution.  

UC Berkeley recently announced a 
new financial aid program that would 
help middle-income families struggling 
with rising tuition fees. The first of its 
kind in any public university of UC 
Berkeley’s stature, the Berkeley Middle 
Class Access Plan (MCAP) reduces 
the contribution parents make to the 
total yearly cost of Cal — including 
tuition, housing and books — to 15 
percent of their total annual income. 
Students with a family income between 
$80,000 and $140,000 are eligible for 
the program, which will be in effect 
starting the 2012-13 school year for 
all domestic undergraduate students, 
including incoming freshmen. This 
kind of program is vital in order to 
offer quality higher education to more 
people, but there is still a long way to go 
before it will be possible for other major 
public universities to offer this kind of 
assistance — especially in the rest of the 
UC system.

Though some may ask why the 
extra money isn’t being allocated 
to low-income students, the new 

plan targeting around 85 percent of 
Californian families will come as an 
appreciated rescue to a struggling 
middle class. According to College 
Board, tuition rates have increased 
over 130 percent since 1988, but the 
median income of U.S. households has 
remained stagnant around $33,000. 
Financial aid hasn’t been able to keep 
up either — since 1992, the largest 
amount of government-subsidized 
loans a student can take out has 
stayed at $23,000, never changing to 
accommodate students’ increasing 
needs. With income and financial aid 
unable to meet the demands of rising 
tuition costs, middle-income families 
are forced to make hard decisions when 
it comes to affording higher education 
without mountains of debt. The 
Department of Education shows that 
numbers of middle-income students 
enrolled in four-year colleges have 
dropped as their enrollment in two-
year colleges has risen, demonstrating 
the sacrifices families are making when 
it comes to their children’s education.

Financial aid plans for middle-
income students, like the Berkeley 
MCAP, already exist in a few well-
funded private universities across the 
country in response to the country’s 
growing economic crisis. Five Ivy 
League schools are cutting the costs for 

middle-income students by drawing 
from their billion dollar endowments, 
and Northwestern is eliminating all 
student loans and replacing them with 
grants. One generous donor, a 1946 
University of Oregon alum named 
Marry Corrigan Solari, took matters 
into her own hands and donated $5 
million in scholarships for University of 
Oregon students from middle-income 
families who are ineligible for federal 
grants that target low-income students. 
And now help for middle-income 
families is making its way to public 
universities.

Currently, UC Berkeley is one of 
the only public institutions that can 
afford to offer this program without 
taking away from any other financial 
aid assistance. Officials at Cal say 
that the source of the money will be 
funded by a portion of out-of-state 
and international students, who pay 
an extra $22,000 per year, as well as 
money redirected from other sources. 
In the press conference held over break 
announcing the Berkeley MCAP, Vice 
Chancellor Frank Yeary commented 
that they hope the program will attract 
a considerable amount of philanthropic 
support to help offset the plan’s costs 
and possibly expand it in future years.

Middle Class Aid Won’t Take from Other Programs

QUITE FRANKLY By Lior Schenk LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
I want to tell you why I love 

college. College is experiencing 
absolute wind-in-your-face 
freedom for the �rst time. College 
is befriending the most diverse 
array of interesting people you will 
ever meet on a daily basis. College 
is slowly walking away in profound 
awe from conversations that will 
fundamentally change who you 
are. And I’m not going to lie to you, 
college is unleashing your inner 
party animal on Friday nights.

UCSD is every one of these 
things for me. But I didn’t always 
see that. When I was a freshman, 
I referred to our school as a 
complete and utter social black 
hole. Homesickness and the always 
impending danger of contracting 
Triton Eye certainly did not help. 
And I did nothing to change my 
situation. Oh how wrong I was.

One a�ernoon conversation with 
a Triton Alumni changed everything 
for me. I got a chance to have a 
�eeting conversation with the man 
who served as the A.S. President 
and who led the vote to approve the 
construction of Price Center. His 
one innocent question was, “How’s it 
working out for you?”

I don’t know about you, but I 
can’t imagine a UCSD without the 
hub that is Price Center. I said as 
much to him in my answer to his 
question. I never caught the man’s 
name and never saw him again, but 
his words resounded inside of me. 
“Every person on this campus has a 
real voice, and if we want something 
changed on our own campus, 
we better embody that change 
and do something about it.” And 
that’s exactly what I did, plunging 
into positions of responsibility 

within student government, 
student organizations, fraternities, 
everything under the San Diego sun.

�at’s when I realized how truly 
special UCSD is. We attend a world-
class university that is only ��y years 
old. In that half-century, UCSD 
has produced more meaningful 
contributions to society than 
institutions twice its age. And every 
man and woman who has passed 
through has been a part of that.

It will only get better in the next 
��y years. I’m sure of it. Imagine a 
campus connected by a thirty minute 
tram to downtown and by a ninety-
minute bullet train to San Francisco. 
Imagine painting your body blue 
and gold for a Division I football 
game against a hated rival. Imagine 
running wild around a magni�cent 
Greek Row. Just imagine.

All it takes to make this a reality 
is for Tritons to be involved. �is 
letter is a call for Tritons to do 
exactly that. I challenge every Triton 
to join the student organizations that 
are the social lifeblood of our school. 
Participate in and even help establish 
Triton traditions. Be educated 
on new referendums and student 
government initiatives. Never be 
afraid to make new friends every 
single day. I did these things and I 
can honestly say I’ve had the time of 
my life here at UCSD. You can too. 
Best of luck Triton Nation.

Even with this new program, UC Berkeley still has 
enough money to support its low-income students. UC 
Berkeley and the UC system have multiple financial aid 
programs funded by different sources that are aimed 
directly at low-income students. In 1991, UC Berkeley 
created the Incentive Awards Program to provide 
educational and financial access to high-achieving 
students who face socioeconomic barriers from 
underserved communities, providing up to $32,000 in 
scholarship funds over the students’ four years at the 
school. The UC system as a whole has the UC Blue and 
Gold Opportunity Plan, which provides money to students 
whose family earns less than $80,000 and is eligible for 
financial aid to cover all educational and student services 
fees. The Berkeley MCAP, on the other hand, provides 
financial aid to families who have just missed the cutoff 
for aid, but still need the help.

With the obvious benefits of the Berkeley MCAP, it 
would seem ideal to implement it across the UC system, 
especially here at UCSD. However, UCSD does not 
have the same kind of funds that UC Berkeley does. In 
the 2010-11 school year, 14 percent of UC Berkeley’s 
undergraduate population included out-of-state and 
international students, while UCSD had only 7.7 percent. 
And, according to the September 2011 edition of the 
UCSD Operating Budget Handbook, the extra fees paid 
by these students are already allocated towards supporting 
the main functions of the campus, including instruction 
and institutional support.

While Berkeley’s MCAP will be relieving many families 
of the mounting cost of college for UC Berkeley’s middle-
income students, for now it seems it will only be helping 
UC Berkeley students.

BEHIND THE SCENES

U CSD Housing and Dining, happy to shoot for the obvi-ous puns, has planted Roots right below Pines dining hall. 
Students may have returned from break to the find the 

grand opening of Roots — an all-vegan dining hall — last 
Monday, Jan. 9, however, it’s been roughly five years since the 
idea for the restaurant was first seeded. 

Executive Chef Vaughn Vargus, who supports all of UCSD’s 
dining facilities through Housing and Dining, headed the way 
in developing the menu.

“A vegan/vegetarian concept had started back then as an 
idea, and following the culinary trends, it was always on the 
table — it was just when and where,” Vargus said. “It was prob-
ably through the initiation of redesigning and restructuring 
Pines that it seemed like a natural fit down here.”

Previously a Mexican restaurant (El Mercado) and prior to 
that, a burger joint (the Rathskeller), the space has been trans-
formed with crisp tones of orange, green and blue to reflect the 
clean and modern essence of their menu, which features more 
than just raw greens and tofu. 

“We’ve covered a lot of different bases with options and vari-
eties of the dishes that we serve here at Roots that are vegan,” 

Vargus said. “There’s some savory. There’s some light fare. There 
are comfort-style foods, if you will, and there are some whimsi-
cal dishes as well.” 

Several items on the menu may seem almost too familiar to 
non-herbivores.

“There are a couple of items that are reminiscent of what 
you’d expect of college dining,” Vargus said. “Hamburgers, fries, 
those types of things. But the quality and the type of ingredients 
we’re using — it’s different. The vegetable-based protein patty 
— that’s far superior in my mind than a black bean burger or a 
grain-based burger. This is good stuff; it’s the real deal.”

The authentic, restaurant-quality food that Vargus spoke of 
took more than a stroll through a vegetable garden to achieve. 
To meet the strict criteria of veganism, a lot of research was 
conducted to eliminate all animal by-products.

“There’s no refined sugar, honey — anything like that,” 
Vargus said. “So with doing our homework, educating ourselves 
and talking to a lot people that we know who have maintained 
a vegan lifestyle for 10 to 15 years, there was a lot of good infor-
mation that we harnessed and adapted to what our menu is 
today.” 

After making the decision halfway through last quarter to 

go completely vegan, the staff sorted through recipes to concoct 
a fresh, nutrient-filled menu. Diners can now choose from a 
selection of healthy options — perhaps a “chicken” burger, a 
bowl of hot kettle chili and a side of sweet potato fries, compli-
mented with a broccoli and berry smoothie. 

The diligent work put into the menu seems to have paid off; 
Vargus revealed his excitement about the success that they’ve 
already experienced after only three days.

“The feedback and the response that we’re getting from our 
guests — the clients, the students — have been positive straight 
across the board,” Vargus said. “I really am so happy with our 
staff with what we’ve achieved.”

Following the trends of vegan cuisine, their menu may 
change from time to time. 

“We’ll go into the seasons,” Vargus said. “We’ll obviously 
add more dishes as the time comes [and] keep the ones that are 
obviously popular.” 

Beaming with pride, Vargus admitted to bragging when he 
asserted his confidence in Roots.

“I’m very proud of what we’ve done here, and I think the 
proof is in the pudding — the proof is in the avocado pudding!” 
Vargus said.

San Diego Restaurant Week

C ash strapped foodies, rejoice. San Diego Restaurant Week is back — it’s time to dust off that blazer, ditch the dining hall and take full advantage of this twice annual, prix fix extravaganza. With 180 par-ticipating restaurants stretching from Chula Vista to Oceanside, from classic steakhouses to well, Nobu, 
it won’t be too difficult to persuade your persnickety suitemates to finally go on that oft-promised suite dinner.

First, a little history on restaurant week. The first one began in New York City in 1992 when the city hosted 
the Democratic National Convention. Tim Zagat and friends wanted the attendees of the event to experience 
New York’s culinary gems, and convinced dozens of restaurants around the city to host a special prix fix menu 
for the price of $19.92 — the year of the convention. For years after that, the price crept up one cent each year 
to coincide with the date, and the “restaurant week” concept has reached every major city. 

What’s different about San Diego is that for years, its restaurants only offered dinner options, priced $20-40. 
After they started offering $10-20 lunch options last year, the eating field opened up considerably.  

If you’re stuck within the pricey confines of La Jolla proper, well then, lucky you. La Jolla’s tastiest restaurants 
are all up for grabs this week, the most notable being George’s at the Cove. Arguably the best restaurant in La 
Jolla, George’s boasts two differently priced dining rooms — the swankier “California Modern” ($40) and the 
picture perfect rooftop terrace ($30). With entrees like pacific albacore with pancetta wrapped salsify, this is 
probably your best chance to out-douche your housemates this quarter. 

For those of us who think $40 is too pricey for a single meal — that is, most of us — the $10 lunch menus 
are the way to go. Admittedly, the restaurants are fewer and instead of three courses, it’s usually only two. But 
it’s still hard to beat options like seafood ravioli and mango panna cotta ($10, Via Italia Trattoria in Encinitas) in 
terms of price and quality.

At first I didn’t recognize my symptoms as 

mental illness – I thought I was just having 

some bad days. Then, I learned that 1 in 4 

adults experience mental health challenges 

such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder 

and others. I got help and now I am moving 

forward with my life. Recovery is possible and 

getting help is an important first step.

Mental illness  
can affect anyone.

SD SUSHI NINJAS

A ttention food truck cult-ists of UCSD: There’s a new truck on the 
block. SD Sushi Ninjas 
is a gourmet food truck 
servicing the La Jolla 
and San Diego county 
area (and soon to be 
delivering to campus 
on select days), fusing 
the old with the new by 
taking the traditional 
art of sushi-making and 
remixing it with the 
trendy foodie culture of 
today.

The entire din-
ing experience can be 
summed up simply with the word 
“cool,” from the Top 40 music 
bumping from the truck, to the 
friendly confidence exuded from 
co-owner and UCSD alum, Danny 
Jeon. The truck itself, while claim-
ing to channel the ninja-essence, is 
anything but nondescript, boasting 

a huge cartoon ninja on the side of 
the otherwise sleek black vehicle, 

with their motto of 
serving “sushi with 
attitude” printed 
above the ordering 
window. 

The eclectic menu 
has many appetizing 
options, including 
convenient and pop-
ular hand rolls (ideal 
for an inexpensive 
grab-and-go lunch) 
and more inventive 
specialty cut-rolls, 
which offer a variety 
of winning flavor 

combinations. Plus, with chuckle-
worthy names like the “Afro Ninja” 
and the “Skittles Roll,” placing an 
order is worth it just for the chance 
to say, “I’d like a Jessica Albacore, 
please.”

Not that the rolls are all gim-
mick. The truck’s chef, Jin Kin, has 

managed to maintain a standard 
of presentation, with every roll 
crafted surprisingly delicately. He 
also works fast and, most impor-
tantly, keeps the rolls neat and tidy 
to avoid the fall-apart factor — the 
Achilles’ Heel of many other sushi 
artists. 

The Sake Bomb ($7), one of 
their specialty rolls, is a standout. 
Filled with crab, daikon sprouts, 
cucumber and avocado and topped 
with seared salmon, red onion, 
bonito flakes and a delicate touch 
of basil mayonnaise, it’s impressive-
ly flavorful yet not overpowering, 
with a unique hint of smokiness to 
the salmon that adds extra depth to 
the already inventive bite.

The Crispy Albacore Roll ($7), 
is another hit, stuffed with crab and 
shrimp tempura, topped with fresh 
albacore tuna and avocado and 
then garnished with crispy onion 
strips and garlic chips under a driz-
zling of ponzu sauce. The balance 
of textures is nice, though the fla-
vors (notably, the shrimp) get lost 
in the mixture, lacking presence in 
the overall taste of the dish. 

The Afro-Ninja Roll ($7) wins 
the prize for the most heart-
throbbing dish of the truck — a 
spicy concoction of tuna, crab and 
jalapenos, offset by the creamy avo-
cado and cream cheese, then deep-
fried and smothered in spicy mayo 
and eel sauce. 

Admittedly, deep-fried rolls 
from the back of a truck may sound 
ludicrous to sushi traditionalists, 
but SD Sushi Ninjas are certainly 
worth a Twitter follow. Look out 
for them on the streets; it’s a tasty 
curbside meal.

Tritons Post Longest Winning Streak in School History
teams that can’t keep up with the breakneck pace of the run 
and gun style, leading the conference in both total points 
per game, with an average of 80.8 points. 

And against the Otters, quick substitutions and 
commitment to full-court defense kept the Tritons in the 
first half.

“Tonight we did try and get a few more people in, even 
in shorter spurts to maybe get us a little more rest. [Luzar] 
did a great job coming in tonight. [White and Seto] gave 
us some very quality minutes,” said Elliot. “We still believe 
we’re in as good a shape as anybody in the country, and as 
we kept running, we became more and more successful as 
the game went on.”

UCSD took the momentum into the second half, 

shooting 54 percent from the field, compared to the Otters’ 
paltry 28 percent, and never conceded the lead.

Four Tritons recorded in double-figures, with Osga 
leading UCSD with 22 points on eight of 10 shooting. 
Carlisle — named the CCAA Player of the Week for the 
second time this season — chipped in 16 points, while 
Freidenberg and Feder contributed 18 and 15 points 
respectively.     

Undefeated in the 2012 season, the Tritons have not yet 
reached the midway point in conference play. 

UCSD will host its next six games, facing Sonoma State 
on Friday, Jan. 20 and Humboldt State on Saturday, Jan. 21.

a zone defense to a man defense. This change forced Cal State 
East Bay to stop relying on their perimeter and open shots, and 
work in side.

With the clock winding down, McCann took the out of 
bounds throw-in for the Tritons, but the Pioneer guarding him 
turned his back to guard against the alley-oop. McCann threw 
the ball off his backside and hit the open jumper to put the 
Tritons ahead with a minute to go.

In the final seconds, Hatch was fouled with the score in 
UCSD’s favor 69-67. To win the game, he needed to hit both 
shots. He hit one of two, setting up Cal State East Bay’s junior 
Jason Smith for the open three-pointer to send the game into 
overtime.  
    “You know it comes down to defense,” said Brue after the 
game, “That’s a win or a loss right there, defending that three-
pointer. Instead we let him shoot a wide open shot.” 
    Although the Tritons left to an early five-point lead, they 
let the Pioneers come back to within a point with 40 seconds 
remaining. Because both teams were in double bonus, the 
Pioneers subbed in all guards on offense and all forwards on 
defense as the two teams traded free throws for the remainder 
of the game. In the end, the Tritons hit only 18 of 30 freethrows 
while the Pioneers sank 19 of 22. 
    With the Tritons up 79-78, Pioneer leading scorer Mark 
Samuels drove to the bucket with only five seconds remaining 
to sink the winning bucket for the final score of 79-80. 
McCann had a chance to make a final runner from behind the 
arc, but he wasn’t granted the shooter’s roll as it rattled out to 
end the game. 

    McCann finished with a career high of 22 points and seven 
assists, while Hatch trailed with 16 points and 14 rebounds. 
Brue had a 15-point game with six rebounds, five assists, three 
blocks and two steals. 
    For the team to have played so well against a Pioneer team 
that recently beat No. 2 Nationally-ranked Cal Poly Pomona 
was impressive. 
    Although the Tritons faired better the next night against 
1-7 CCAA opponent Cal State Monterey Bay. The Tritons 
lost Hatch to a sprained wrist sustained in the loss Friday, so 
senior center Ryan Wheeler stepped into the center position 
for the Tritons and handled the pressure quite well, scoring six 
and nabbing four rebounds. Where he stood out most was on 
defense, as he stopped anything driving down the middle.  
    Junior guard Tyler McGrath continued his lackluster 
offensive streak, hitting only 1-8. Although McGrath sunk a 
three to put the Tritons ahead 60-54. Again down the stretch 
he hit two freethrows with only four seconds left to solidify the 
Triton win 71-67.  
    McCann had a good night, hitting four of five from behind 
the arc and scoring 19 points, the same as Brue, who was 7-9 
from the free-throw line. 
    The Tritons have shown improvement in their past two 
games, displaying the type of hustle needed to turn around 
their season. At 2-8 in conference play, it will be a long road 
but they still have a shot at a postseason run or a CCAA 
championship.

The UCSD Men’s and Women’s Swim Teams — ranked No. 1 in Division II — bested two Division I teams this Saturday, Jan. 14 at the Loyola Marymount University 
Burns Aquatic Center. The women beat Loyola Marymount with 
a score of 167-94 and the men won against No. 8 ranked Division 
I Cal State Bakersfield with a strong showing of 165-97. 

The women’s team had a dominant performance, sweeping 
two events. In the 1000 IM freestyle, sophomore Bethany Dong 
took first (10:41.41), freshman Jessica Norgaard took second 
(10:45.82) and freshman Megan Lee placed third (10:52.74). The 
Tritons collected another clean sweep in the 200 IM, with senior 
Alex Henley in first (2:09.57), freshman Summer Bennett in 
second (2:12.20) and freshman Eva Chen in third (2:13.14). 

Senior All-American Henley was the big winner on the 
women’s side, taking first in both the 100 yard backstroke (57.48) 
and the 200 yard backstroke (2:04.82). Henley was also named 
Division II Female Swimmer of the Week by CollegeSwimming.
com for her recent performances against Division I competition, 
San Diego State and Grand Canyon.

Other multiple medal winners included UCSD junior Emily 
Adamczyk in the 100 IM and 200 IM breaststroke with times of 
1:05.51 and 2:19.45, respectively, and sophomore Anji Shakya, 
who won the 200 IM and 500 IM freestyle with respective times 
of 1:54.10 and 5:08.06. 

The men’s team had one of the best meets of their season 
against Cal State Bakersfield, going 1-2-3 in five different races. 
Triton junior Alex Rice topped the field in two events, placing 
first in the 100 IM butterfly (51.35) followed by junior Adam Yen 
(51.69) in second and freshman Dane Stassi (52.21) in third. 

The Tritons swept in the 200 IM as well, with Rice placing 
first (1:55.80), sophomore See Han Lee in second (1:59.32) and 
sophomore Nick Korth in third (1:59.57). UCSD had success 
in both breaststroke events — in the 100 IM, Korth won with a 
time of 56.84, Lee took second (58.12) and senior Griffin Bracke 
placed third (58.86). In the 200 IM butterfly, Stassi took first 
(1:53.89), Rice took second (1:54.98) and sophomore Ahiram 
Rodriguez took third (1:55.73).

UCSD’s next meet will be its last one before the PCSC 
Championships — they will be swimming at Cal Baptist 
University on Saturday, Jan. 21. The PCSC championships will be 
held Feb. 8-11.

Without a loss in the 2012 season, the No. 2 UCSD women’s basketball team has strung together the most 
wins in school history after taking down Cal 
State East Bay 84-73 last Friday and No. 24 
Cal State Monterey Bay 91-63 on Sunday.

On Friday, the nationally ranked Tritons 
faced Cal State East Bay — 2-7 in conference, 
3-10 overall — beating the Pioneers by their 
third closest margin this season. 

“It wasn’t very pretty and East Bay played 
tremendously,” said head coach Charity 
Elliott. “I probably played a few people more 
minutes than I would have hoped but we got 
the win and that’s what we needed to do.”

The Tritons had won the 14 games prior 
to their bout against East Bay with an average 
scoring margin of 20 points. The 84-73 result 
fell well below this watermark, but seemed to 
be a consequence of difficulties with rotation 
and transitioning back on defense. 

Within the first ten minutes, the Tritons 
put together a ten-point lead, which was 
quickly whittled down to three after Elliott 
brought on underclassmen guards Megan 
Perry and Miranda Seto. Elliott was forced 
to replace senior All-American guard 
Chelsea Carlisle and starting forward Erin 
Dautremont back on the court. Junior guard 
Emily Osga immediately hit a jumper to put 
UCSD up by five, after which Carlisle picked 
up one of her three steals on the night to put 
in a layup. With the starting five back on the 
court, UCSD manufactured a 14-point run, to 
end the half with a 17-point lead. 

“[Carlisle] did an amazing job tonight 
of settling us down and getting a basket 
when East Bay went on a run,” said Elliot. 
“[Carlisle] hit some tough shots, or made the 
great pass for an easy basket.” 

Carlisle finished the game with 20 points 
on a career high of 12 assists, while senior 
forward Lauren Freidenberg recorded 20 
points and eight rebounds. 

But the Tritons would not get much out of 
their bench for the rest of the night, with Cal 
State East Bay’s reserves outscoring the Triton 
bench 33-7. 

The Pioneers staged a comeback late in 
the game, led by junior forward Marlene 
MacMillan and sophomore forward Cassie 
Coble, who cut the Tritons’ 17-point lead 
down to eight. But UCSD would maintain the 
advantage to take its fifteenth straight win.

On Saturday, UCSD met with the only 
other undefeated team in the conference in 
No. 24 Cal State Monterey Bay, beating the 
Otters 63-91.

Last season, Cal State Monterey Bay won 
the CCAA tournament with a 20-2 conference 
record. In the first meeting between the two 

teams, the Otters took an 11-point lead. 
“We knew [Cal State Monterey Bay] would 

come in and attack us hard. And they did,” 
said Elliot. “I thought our team did great in 
keeping their composure. We went down by 
11 [points], and we just kept chipping away 
and tried to be consistent.” 

Down 11 points, 12 minutes into the 
game, the Tritons kept in contact with the 
Otters, steadily breaking down the lead 
with contributions from all over the UCSD 
roster. And by the end of the half, UCSD 
manufactured a 15-point swing, leading by 

four going into the second half. 
“We started turning up a bit of our 

intensity. Defensively, we just had a little sense 
of urgency, contesting shots, rebounding,” 
said Elliot. “[CSU Monterey Bay’s] a 
phenomenal offensive rebounding team. I 
thought we did a good job of containing and 
controlling that part of it, and then we just 
started running.”

On Saturday, the Tritons stuck to their 
full-court man-to-man defense. UCSD buries

This past weekend, the Triton Men’s 
Basketball team split its home games against 
Cal State East Bay on Friday and Cal State 
Monterey Bay on Saturday. Although they have 
had a rough run over the past few games — 
UCSD is 2-8 in the CCAA — this weekend’s 
performances give hope for the second half of 
the season. 
    Friday’s match-up started well for the Tritons 
as UCSD scored a quick bucket when senior 
Justin Brue hit sophomore James McCann for 
the opening bucket. The Tritons then jumpead 
to an 8-2 lead in the first four minutes of play, 
but failed to maintain the advantage. East Bay 
surged back to 11-10 with 14 minutes left in the 
half.  
    The Tritons kept their composure in the 
backcourt, but the offense broke down on 
several occasions against a stout Cal State East 
Bay defense, forcing Brue and McCann to create 
opportunities off the dribble. 

     With the forced offense, East Bay had 
several break away chances, pushing the Tritons 
out of their motion-oriented attack. Forced into 
a “run and gun” situation, the Tritons started to 
tire quickly, with senior forward Christian Hatch 
looking bogged down at the eight-minute mark, 
further slowing the offense and making it easy 
for Cal State East Bay to push the tempo even 
more. 

    Cal State East Bay freshman Jicari 

Whitman hit three three-pointers in the closing 
minutes of the first half as the Pioneers stretched 
their lead to 26-37 on a 2-11 run. Brue checked 
back into the game after two of the threes and 
single handedly re-ignited the Tritons. Brue 
made a block to set up a left-handed hook shot 
back on his end of the court, and then followed 
with a driving layup to bring the score to within 
seven, forcing the Pioneers to take a timeout. 
Brue continued his streak, catching the ball in 
the corner and driving to the rim and spinning 
off the Pioneer defenders for another basket. 
Pumped up, Brue fouled East Bay’s Mark 
Samuels and allowed the Pioneers two points. 

Brue then made two more blocks to end the half 
on a 6-2 UCSD run to make it 32-39. 
    Coming off halftime, the Tritons tried to settle 
into a rhythm with their motion offense, but 
could not find a hole in the Pioneer defense. 
Brue had another block to set up a nice pass 
from McCann to Hatch for an easy bucket that 
helped spark a 13-6 Triton run, to make it a one-
point game.  
    Junior Tyler McGrath helped solidify the run 
with an amazing defensive run in the middle of 
the half as he drew a charge from Whitfield, then 
blocked another Pioneer to keep the score 45-46 
and the momentum in Triton hands. East Bay 

moved the ball well and took good shots against 
the Triton man defense, but McGrath then took 
another charge to really get the crowd on their 
feet. Brue took advantage and hit a turn around 
jumper for the lead.  
    At this point, both teams’ half court offenses 
started deteriorating. The Tritons had four 
turnovers in two minutes, but managed to hang 
on and retake the lead, 52-51. The lead changed 
hands several times as the time wound down, 
but things began to swing towards the Tritons, as 
UCSD head coach Chris Carlson switched from
