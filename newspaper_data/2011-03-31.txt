UCSD students have formed a coalition 
to raise money for victims of the March 11 
earthquake and tsunami that devatstated 
Japan. 

The Japanese Student Association 
teamed up with other student organizations 
— including the UCSD Rady School of 
Management, International House and the 
School of International Relations/Pacific 
Studies —  to form the fundraising group 
Help Japan.

“Many members of JSA have friends or 
family or know students studying abroad 
in Japan,” JSA Vice President Internal 
Yuta Morinaga said. “I know of at least five 
students studying abroad in Japan that had to 
come back [to campus] last week.” 

JSA initially had a goal of raising $1,000 
for the Red Cross through a donation website, 
but then changed their goal to $10,000. The 
group reached the goal on March 21 and its 
current fund surpasses $11,000. 

Although JSA first planned to send funds 
directly to the Miyagi Prefecture — one of the 
coastal communities affected by the tsunami 
— JSA announced via its  Facebook page that 
all proceeds will benefit the Japanese Red 
Cross due to the declining value of the U.S. 
dollar in Japan. 

The Japanese Red Cross will be providing 
first aid, emotional support and relief items 
to those displaced with mobile clinics and 
shelters. 

 Japan is still recovering from both the 
earthquake — measured at a record-breaking 
9 on the Richter scale, and the world’s fifth-
largest since 1990 —  and the subsequent 
tsunami that struck about 250 miles northeast 
of Tokyo.

A CLOSER LOOK

Following UCSD’s announcement that the campus will fund $502,873 
in lifeguard services at Black’s Beach starting March 14, two rescues took 
place on March 29.  

According to UCSD spokesperson Rex Graham, the first rescue took 
place yesterday at 3:05 p.m., when a 22-year-old female UCSD student 
was rescued and did not sustain any injuries.

The second rescue took place at 4:10 p.m., involving a male UCSD 
student who lives in Tioga who was with two non-UCSD friends. The 
three individuals were also not injured.

In the one-year agreement with the City of San Diego, the university 
will fund two winter-season lifeguards, while the city will pay for an addi-
tional four lifeguards during summer. The increase will provide Black’s 
Beach with two lifeguards during winter and six during summer season 
— the same amount as before the 2009 state budget cuts.

“We will pay in the winter months and they will pay during the regu-
lar year,” Matthews said.

Budget cuts reduced lifeguard services to two lifeguards during high 
season, from mid-June to Labor’s Day, and eliminated during the winter.

Black’s Beach, the closest beach to campus, has been partially owned 
by UCSD since 1967.

 According to Vice Chancellor of Resource Management and Planning 
Gary Matthews, it is frequented by many students and faculty members 
throughout the year. Matthews said the beach’s frequent use by students 
made the university feel an obligation to help pay for the additional 
services. 

“We were probably the only ones who could afford [to pay] and 
[UCSD] is the most directly impacted due to the number of students 
and faculty that visit [Black’s Beach],” Matthews said. “It was a matter of

NeW GPA RequiRemeNT FoR TRANSFeR STudeNTS

Community college students wishing to 
enter UCSD through the Transfer Admission 
Guarantee now have to earn GPAs of 3.5 or 
higher to be eligible for admission, effective Fall 
Quarter 2012.

The TAG program promises guaranteed 
admission participating UC undergraduate 
campuses for students who fulfill a certain set 
of course requirements and obtain a certain 

GPA. Seven of the nine UC campuses use the 
TAG program, which is offered at all California 
community colleges. UCLA and UC Berkeley 
do not participate in the program. Previously, all 
participating schools had a 3.0 minimum GPA 
except UC Santa Barbara, whose minimum was 
3.2. UCSD’s new 3.5 requirement is now the 
highest in the system. According to Associate 
Vice Chancellor of Admissions Mae Brown, the 
mean GPA for transfer students admitted for 
Fall Quarter 2010 was 3.55.

Brown said the university changed the 

requirements due to its increasing inability 
to accommodate the growing 
number of transfer applications.

Of the 70,474 applications 
received for Fall 2011, more than 
17,000 are transfer students. Of 
all the transfer students, 9,000 are 
TAG applicants.

 “This incredible growth represents a 
19-percent increase when comparing Fall 2010,”

Council Installs Condom Machines in Price Center
By Rebecca Horwitz
Staff Writer

Condom and dental dam 
dispensers will be installed in four 
Price Center East bathrooms as part 
of  an A.S. Council-sponsored sexual 
health empowerment program.

A.S. Campuswide Senator 
Elizabeth Elman, along with 
Campuswide Senator Zoe Seher and 
University Centers Director Paul 
Terzino spearheaded the initiative.

Elman said the machines will be 
installed in Price Center Theater lobby 
bathrooms in addition to bathrooms 
on the second floor of Price Center 
East because those bathrooms have 
the most student traffic. She will be 

surveying what kind of change students 
carry before finalizing the cost, but the 
minimum cost will be five cents. 

The program will cost $2,512.12. 
About $2,000 will be funded by the 
Student Services Office and $416.12 
from council’s General Initiatives fund 
allocated for senator projects.

“The only real cost is the condoms 
and they are pretty cheap,” Elman said.

The initiative, budget and an 
amendment that makes condom 
dispensers part of the Office of 
Student Services Constitution were 
all approved at the March 30 A.S. 
meeting. The amendment ensures that 
these sexual health services will always 
be available to students. 

The dispensers will also have 

information about sexually transmitted 
infections and locations for STI 
counseling. 

“It’s important for students to 
have the information and to know 
where to get tested,” Elman said. “The 
Student Health Center no longer has 
the funds to do this, A.S. can take it 
upon itself to provide students with 
this information.”

Though there is no set installation 
date, Elman said the dispensers will 
probably be installed before the end of 
the quarter.

Terzino could not be reached for 
comment.

researchers Uncover Massive Underwater Sea Mountains
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Rebecca Horwitz
Staff Writer

Researchers at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography 
discovered colossal uncharted 
mountains underneath the waters 
of the South Atlantic Ocean while 
exploring the seafloors.

Many of these mountains, called 
seamounts, are previously unexplored. 
The largest one rises 14,700 feet 
from the sea floor, making it taller 
than California’s tallest point, Mount 
Whitney. According to geophysics 
professor David Sandwell, the 
newly discovered seamounts are 
inactive volcanoes that can affect 
plate tectonics, ocean climate and 
underwater organisms. For example, 
a large current deflected by the 
seamount could change the direction 
and climate of the ocean. 

“If you have a big current and it 
hits a volcano, it can be deflected to a 
different direction which could change 
the climate,” Sandwell said. “If a warm 
current hits a seamount and changes 

direction, it could create a warmer 
climate.”

Understanding the location and 
size of the seamounts gives information 
about the plates and mantle from 
which it formed.

“They are a special kind of 
seamount which were once at sea 
level [but that got eroded] flat through 
millions of years, subsided and got 
deeper, about 500 meters below sea 
level,” Sandwell said.

The mountains were charted out 
for the first time by scientists — led by 
Captain Chris Curl and geophysicist 
J.J. Becker —aboard Scripps research 
vessel the R/V Melville. The crew 
navigated through the underwater 
mountains from Feb. 20 to March 14.

The discovery was an accident. 
While exploring unknown underwater 
features in a different location in the 
South Atlantic, the vessel was forced 
to take an alternative route after poor 
weather made navigating in the South 
Atlantic difficult. Researchers then 
found the large underwater mountains.

“This was an uncharted area of the 

sea,” Sandwell said. “It’s very remote 
and it takes about four days of ship 
time to get to that location.”

Sandwell — who guided researchers 
aboard the Melville from South Africa 
to Chile while he remained in La Jolla 
— then charted the mountains and 
mapped the sea floor to observe plate 
tectonics and underwater fault lines. 

“[We wanted] to chart these 
undersea volcanoes to know something 
about geology of ocean basis,” Sandwell 
said. “Like plate tectonics, if you could 
map sea floors completely, you could 
know all about plate tectonics.”

The researchers used a multibeam 
echo sounder to measures distances 
by transmitting sound waves and 
analyzing the return echo that 
bounced back from the seafloor and 
seamounts. Curl watched the device 
to make sure they were not too close 
to the seamounts and in danger of 
running aground. 

The team found about six 
seamounts, which were about 300 to 
600 meters above the seafloor, which 
is usually about 5,000 meters deep. 

Researchers also found faults on the 
seafloor that are about the same size as 
the San Andreas Fault. 

The Melville’s current expedition 
includes analyzing the ocean floor of 
Valparaiso, Chile, to determine how 
the 8.8-magnitude earthquake that 
occurred in February 2010 changed 
the Earth’s crust. This information will 
be used to determine how earthquakes 
cause deformations in the sea floor.

Campuswide Senator Anish 
Bhayani gave another depressing 
presentation about the libraries. The 
medical center library in Hillcrest 

will close on April 1. The SIO, IR/
PS, CLICS and the Science and 
Engineering libraries will close in 
June. Bhayani said this is the best-
case scenario because it is the least 

amount the librar-
ies can cut. He 
said there may be 
more cuts in the 
future.   There 
have already been 
multiple decreases 
in library staff, 
student jobs and 

facility hours since the 2007-08 fiscal 
year. But there have been increases in 
students, academic faculty, staff and 
activity levels since then.

Roughly $6 million has been cut 
from the library budget since 2007-
08. The campus budget is $635 mil-
lion and the libraries’ budget is $25 
million, or 3.9 percent of the campus 
core budget. The campus core budget 
is being cut by 10 percent and, logi-
cally, the maximum cut for libraries 
should be $2.3 to $2.4 million. 

Administrators say to prepare 
for a $3- to $6-million cut. Another 
places where the budgets could be 
cut is administration, faculty and staff 
benefits, but administrators refuse to 
reduce their benefits.

The medical center library, science 
and engineering and SIO libraries will 
be consolidated into the Biomedical 
Center Library. CLICS and IR/PS will 
be consolidated into Geisel Library. 
On a brighter note, the science and 
engineering will be open 24 hours 
Sunday-Thursday next year.

The future state of our libraries is 
dire. Bhayani’s presentation time allot-
ment was extended multiple times to 
allow him to answer questions from 
concerned councilmembers.  Bhayani 
suggested spamming the Chancellor’s 
inbox as one of the best ways to reach 
the administration.

safety so it was an important thing to 
do. Plus, the beach is partially owned 
by UCSD.”

UCSD’s involvement is the result 
of a partnership between Chief of San 
Diego Lifeguard Services Rick Wurts 
and Matthews. 

Wurts contacted Matthews when 
staffing was cut in 2009 and then made 
an agreement with the office of City 
of San Diego councilmember Sherri 
Lightner to split the cost of lifeguard 
funding.

Matthews said there has been criti-
cism regarding UCSD’s decision to 
spend $500,000 — which come from 
the university’s campus budget — in 
the midst of further cuts in state fund-
ing. Matthews said the money spent 
is justified because it helps the public.

“What is the value of a human life?” 
Matthews asked. “How do you put a 
price on a human life?” 

Lightner said it is important for 
lifeguard services to resume because 
the cliff access can make it dangerous. 

“Black’s is a very unique beach,” 
Wurts said. “It can only be accessed 
from a long path or a hike. This makes 
it harder for lifeguards to come from 
nearby beaches if there were an emer-
gency.”

He also said that Black’s is an attrac-
tive location for inexperienced surfers.  

“Black’s has a world renowned surf 
but it is dangerous to not-so-experi-
enced surfers and swimmers,” Wurts 
said. 

Parts of Black’s Beach also belong 
to Torrey Pines State Beach. Lightner 
and her staff are currently looking to 
see if the state will provide funding for 
additional lifeguard services.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN www.UCSDGUARDIAN.oRG/oPINIoNTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2011

If campus administrators want to take a giant step away from accessibility and diversity, its new 
transfer admissions policy of raising 
the minimum GPA from 3.0 to 3.5 
does the job.

The new policy — implemented 
under the Transfer Admission 
Guarantee program — is a direct 
response to ever-worsening state bud-
get cuts and ever-growing applicant 
pools. The logic is that if it’s harder 
to get into UCSD, fewer people will 
apply, and issues of overenrollment 
would solve themselves. 

But the new practice is contradic-
tory in light of UCSD’s recent switch 
to holistic admissions to increase 
diversity. Increasing the ethnic diver-
sity of the freshman class only to com-
promise that of third-year transfers 
represents a step back to square one.

What’s more, many incoming 
freshmen may not even get in with a 
3.5 GPA. There’s little justifiable rea-

son for transfer students to be held to 
a more rigorous standards than their 
peers are. 

The raised requirement is also 
the highest of all undergraduate UC 
campuses who use TAG. It decreases 
accessibility — one of the UC system’s 
founding goals — by violating the 
goals of TAG. The program guaran-
tees admission to California students 
who fulfill certain course require-
ments at a community college and 
have a certain GPA, which at most 
campuses is 3.0 According to admis-
sions director Mae Brown, the five-
year-old program has seen applica-
tions grow from 443 in its first year to 
8,715 for fall admissions this year. 

The new policy also goes against 
the diversity efforts of UCSD, who 
boasted higher numbers of underrep-
resented minorities after reaching out 
to transfer students. By imposing a 
higher GPA requirement for students 
from a community college — where 

there is often a more ethnically diverse 
student population — the university 
is discouraging participation in the 
program. 

It’s obvious that we don’t have the 
capacity to maintain current enroll-
ment levels; according to Brown, our 
limited resources can only accom-
modate about 2,300. And it’s true 
that the change could potentially help 
solve the problem of over-enrollment; 
according to Brown, under the new 
guidelines, the applicant pool will be 
reduced by a whooping 50 percent. 
Currently, however, the mean GPA of 
admitted transfer students is already 
3.55, so the evidence that enrollment 
will shrink is far from conclusive. 
That’s why it’d be pointless to create a 
new policy when the university prob-
ably accepts exceptional and deserving 
people with low GPAs — as probable 
under the new holistic admissions 
process.

But the new requirement directly 

cuts from some of the least privileged 
students on campus. It goes against 
the efforts of administrators who are 
reaching out to community colleges, 
where student population are more 
racially diverse — and will reconstruct 
barriers for students who come from 
underrepresented ethnic backgrounds.

majority vote of the editorial board and are not 

necessarily those of the UC Board of Regents, the 
ASUCSD or the members of the Guardian staff. 

While half the Arab world faces violence daily, from the way people here 
whine, you’d think one of the world’s 
most heinous crimes is paying $4.30 
at the pump. 

About 4,000 children die every 
day because they don’t have clean 
water, but people here have the nerve 
to rant about gas prices as if it were 
the greatest injustice on Earth. And 
while I’m sure we’re all a little guilty 
when it comes to complaining about 
an extra $10 at the pump, the worst 
part is people who don’t do anything 

about it. 
Exhibit A: Some genius on 

Facebook (surprise) thought the 
solution to lowering our gas prices 
was for everyone to boycott gas sta-
tions on March 14, and only March 
14. Of course, a boycott for a day 
isn’t effective since everyone ends 
up buying gas the next day or the 
day after that.  Nevertheless, 600,000 
angry people joined thinking it was a 
good idea, and hoping others would 
do the actual boycotting. 

But even if it had succeeded, the 
biggest harm would be to local gas 
station owners who have seen a great 
loss in sales, not the oil companies. 
Thank God people were too lazy to 
even boycott, or their actions could 
have harmed business owners while 
oil companies stored the oil for 
another day.

Exhibit B: Politicians calling for 
offshore drilling take second place 
in this stupidity battle. It’s been 
only nine months since BP’s little 
accident devastated the Southern 
states, yet politicians still have the 
gall to demand more oil. Obviously, 
the environment must be subservi-
ent to the goals of the almighty 
SUV. According to the Energy 
Information administration, more 
drilling would cause gas prices to go 
down by a few cents, but the relief 
would come in 2027, not tomorrow. 
But even this relief comes at the cost 
of environmental catastrophe. Not to 
mention that we’d be postponing the 
inevitable shift from gas to renew-
able energy.

Exhibit C: Tea Party governors 
are blocking funding for high-speed 
rail, which consequently keeps 
gas prices high. The Wisconsin 
and Ohio governors refused fed-
eral funds to build high-speed rail 
between their major cities. These 
governors seem to have missed the 
point that high-speed rail would dis-
courage the use of cars and lower gas 
prices due to lesser demand. In fact, 
Europe, Japan and China have all 
been enjoying the effects of 120 mph 
trains at half fares while our asses are 
stuck on Amtraks that go 60 mph on 
a good day. There’s a budget deficit, 
but realistically, there’s no way to 
lower gas prices without receiving 
some form of assistance. Oil com-
panies aren’t going to learn empathy 
and lower costs. BP, with $66 million 
in daily profits, already had a tough 
time being persuaded to adequately 
compensate victims of the spill.

So, what to do about gas prices? 
First, consider yourself lucky for 
living where cars are practically a 
birthright and gas is, relatively, dirt 
cheap. Don’t forget to use public 
transportation — with free MTS bus 
stickers, there’s no reason not to.

this is no time to talk athletics. 

Student activism pushed UCSD 
into Division II 10 years ago, and 
students should be once again com-
mended for raising enthusiasm for 
the move to Division I. And statisti-
cally speaking, UCSD would better 
fit D-I than D-II: With almost 24,000 
undergrads, UCSD is incredibly large 
for a D-II school, which typically has 
around 3,000 students. Additionally, 
our sports conference, the California 
Collegiate Athletics Association, has 
much lower average SAT/ACT scores 
than UCSD.

 So we look like a D-I school, but 
despite the fact many of our teams 
compete against Division I, and that 
our baseball team is at the top of 
Division II, as a D-II school there 
will always be fewer fans. With fewer 
fans and less enthusiasm for sports 
teams, athletics on this campus isn’t 
much of a priority. Consequently, the 
university has never seen a reason to 
make sports programs a budgetary 
priority, which  means the athletics 
department depends on student fees 
for athletic scholarships (and basi-
cally all other necessary funding.)

According to an A.S. Council and 
Athletics Department-sponsored 
study, the athletics program needs 
an additional $4.8 million by the 
2012-13 academic year to move to 

D-I. And in the absence of out-
side sponsors at a university 

already taking cuts, there’s 
only one place to find that 
money: the students. 

While students were indeed the 
impetus for moving to D-II in the 

past and also for D-I now, 
the cost of moving 

to D-I is, to 
put 

it plainly, unreasonably high for the 
time being. According to the study, 
for the university to make the move, 
student fees need to be increased by 
an estimated 50 percent from $120 
per student per quarter to $180 per 
student per quarter — or $540 per 
student per year. 

Moving to Division-I means that 
instead of paying athletics $260,000 
in aid, we’d be required to increase 
the budget by nearly $3.3 million to 
$3,666,293. 

While raising fees for D-I would 
actually give us a new product for our 
fees — instead of having our tuition 
raised for a deteriorating education 
— voluntarily raising fees for athlet-
ics while guilting the regents for not 
prioritizing students’ finances is more 
than a little hypocritical.

As little as a few years ago, rais-
ing that amount of money might not 
have been too much to balk at. But 
when students are already paying 
more money for less, and both state 
and federal funding is being hacked 
to shreds, the time is not right. 

Money matters aside, it’s possible 
that UCSD students won’t even have 
the chance to vote on whether they 
want to move to Division I. The only 
feasible conference to join is Big West 
Conference, which houses the other 
UC D-I schools (except for Cal and 
UCLA, which are in the more exclu-
sive Pac-10). 

But there’s no guarantee the Big 
West Conference will allow UCSD 
into its sphere. After two separate 
four-year moratoriums, Big West and 
NCAA recently opened applications 
to allow new schools to enter their 
D-I conference; both UCSD and 
University of Hawaii expressed inter-
est, but the Big West opted to add 
only University of Hawaii in 2012. 
Should Big West refuse to extend an 
invitation to UCSD, all bets are off, 
and no amount of student fees will be 
enough to move us to D-I.

There’s no doubt that UCSD 
deserves to be in Division-I. But the 
university is already struggling with

Dear Editor,
Ever since 2001, Hamas (cur-

rent government of the Gaza Strip, 
classified as a terrorist organization 
by the United States, Israel, the 
European Union and a few other 
nations) and other Palestinian 
groups within the Gaza Strip have 
been firing thousands of rockets 
and mortars into cities in 
Southern Israel, especially the 
town of Sderot, which is the closest 
Israeli city to the Gaza Strip.

 In Sderot, residents have 15 
seconds to run to bomb shelters 
from the time the alarm is sounded 
until the rocket explodes. 

Despite an operation by the 
Israeli Defense Forces against 
Hamas in late 2008 to early 2009 to 
prevent more rockets from being 
fired into Israel, the violence has 
not ceased. 

Today, one million people in 
Southern Israel are living in the 
range of these rocket attacks and 
must run to find shelter every time 
they hear the alarm. 
       On April 5, there will be 
an event that will educate stu-
dents about what people living in 
Southern Israel deal with. 

The Sderot Media Center, a 
non-profit citizen journalism orga-
nization which also acts as a news 
agency, will be coming to UCSD to 
speak about the rocket attacks com-
ing into Israel from the Gaza Strip. 

Their mission is to provide a 
voice for those who have to live 
under these conditions and spread 
awareness to the rest of the world. 

The presentation is free and will 
be held in the Price Center Bear 
Room on April 5 from 6:30 p.m. to 
8:30 p.m. 

Free pizza will be provided 
as well. Don’t miss this amazing 
opportunity to hear the incredible 
story of the people of Sderot.

a budget crisis that has 
already increased student 
fees by 40 percent over 
the past two academic 
years. CLICS is slated to 
close next year, and the 
UCSD Medical Hospital 
is closing on April 1. 

Currently, students 
pay a $120 quarterly fee 
for the athletic depart-
ment, and our contri-
bution makes up $6.9 
million of the department’s total 
$7.3 million. While student activism 
efforts like this one are always laud-
able, when UCSD’s athletic’s depart-

ment requires more money than 
students can provide, their constant 

reliance on students 
becomes a problem.

 It would be a differ-
ent story if the univer-
sity did, in fact budget 
athletics, at this point, 
hoping for that they’ll 
be able to squeeze out 
another $12.1 million a 
year is little more than a 
pipe dream.

Which poses the 
question: If not now, then when? 
While it’s a shame for our athletes to 
be confined to Division-II, students 
should prioritize the absolute neces-
sities. 

When libraries are closing and 
professors are being laid off, extend-
ing our athletics — no matter how 
deserving — is not the best option. 
What we can do, however, is look 
for alternatives. Our go-to solution 
shouldn’t be to pass a referendum to 
raise student fees. 

Instead, A.S. Council should form 
a committee to see why our athletics 
department is almost solely funded 
by student fees and see if it’s at all 
feasible to work the bulk of the costs 
into the university’s budget. 

Maybe it’s not possible, but at 
least we would have the knowledge 
that we’ve exhausted every other 
option before turning to the students 
for more funds.

Brown said. “Given the budget cuts 
and campus capacity realities, UC San 
Diego is unable to sustain a guarantee 
program at this level of participation. 

UCSD received almost 9,000 TAG 
applications for Fall 2011

The Committee on Admissions 
met to develop new guidelines to 
sustain the university’s TAG program. 
Brown said the COA reviewed TAG 
data from the past four years and 
examined the impact of continued 
funding restrictions. The university 
then announced the official policy 
change on Feb. 2.

Transfer Senator Jacob Wisdom 
said he feels that the change would be 
more appropriate to take place in Fall 
Quarter 2013 so students hoping to 
transfer have more time to prepare and 
raise their GPAs accordingly.

Brown said she felt the new 
requirement will not detract from 
the diversity efforts, which included 
changing from a comprehensive review 
admissions system to holistic review 
this year. The holistic admissions 
process factors in the opportunities 
that were available to the applicant.

Wisdom said he thinks the change 
will affect diversity initially, but that it 
will not be a long-term  impediment to 
increasing enrollment from students of 
underrepresented groups.

“While the number of TAG-eligible 
minority applicants may dip in the 
short-run, I believe in the years to 
come the increasing prestige of UCSD 
and the continued diversity efforts 
on campus will work to attract more 
qualified minority applicants than ever 
before,” Wisdom said.

reported that the current death toll 
has risen to 10,901, with 17,649 
unaccounted for, as of March 28. 

The country is also grappling 
with the threat of nuclear emergency, 
after nuclear plants in Fukushima 
were wrecked by fire and explosions 
caused by the tsunami.

The earthquake has 
affected members of 
the UC system as well. 

There are 32 
faculty members, 
staff, researchers and 
graduate students that 
work with the UC’s 
partner institutions in 
Japan, and about 80 
UC students currently 
registered with the 
Education Abroad 
Program. 

Because of the travel 
warning issued by the 
U.S. Department of 
State, the UC system 
suspended all of its 
EAP Japan programs. 

UCSD spokesperson Christine 
Clark confirmed that  all 13 UCSD 
students studying abroad in Japan 
have returned. 

On March 16 and 17, members 
of the coalition from the UCSD 
IR/PS program also raised money 
by selling onigiri, or traditional 
Japanese rice balls. Help Japan also 
held a fundraiser with Tapioca 
Express on March 29.

JSA has also been tabling on 
Library Walk this week to promote 
the March 31 Matsuri festival — 
an annual cultural event featuring 
traditional Japanese food, games 
and performances. At the festival, 
the Help Japan campaign will have a 
donation booth.

Students can donate money or 
write letters and messages on cloth 
resembling the Japanese flag, which 
will be sent to prefectures most 
affected by the tsunami. 

Visitors can also make paper 
cranes — Help Japan plans to 
send 1,000 of these with the Red 
Cross donation as a testament to a 

traditional Japanese way 
of expressing good wishes 
of longevity and wellness. 

Morinaga said that 
campus reaction to the 
efforts has been positive. 

“We were surprised by 
the support,” Morinaga 
said. “Without it, we 
wouldn’t have gotten this 
far.”

Morinaga added that, 
although Help Japan has 
surpassed the $10,000 
mark, they plan to raise as 
much money as they can. 

“Other clubs with 
Japanese students or 
student organizations like 

the business frats have contacted us 
about wanting to help,” Morinaga 
said. “After the Matsuri festival, 
our next step is to plan some joint 
fundraisers with other student 
organizations.” 

The Help Japan plans to finish 
fundraising in early April. 

“Students can [help] by coming 
up with ways to reach out to Japan,” 
Morinaga said. “A lot of people came 
up to us and asked us if donating just 
$5 is OK, but the amount doesn’t 
matter. Any form of contribution 
would help people in Japan stay 
strong.”

TONIGHT

T hree weeks ago, “How I Met Your Mother” was renewed for two more seasons. As much as it pains 
me to say it, that’s a season more than 
the show needs. It’s not that “HIMYM” 

isn’t good — I just wish the producers 
would shut up already and finish the 
damn story. 

The problem is, the sitcom is ham-
pered by its premise:  Five years ago, 
Bob Saget’s voice sat his kids (the for-
ever-young Lyndsy Fonseca and David 
Henrie) down in their 2030 home and 
promised them the sometimes-raun-
chy, always-entertaining story of how 
he met their mother (all while remain-
ing endearingly faceless, à la Gossip 
Girl).  

And now, I’m kind of wishing he 
hadn’t. 

There have been plenty of shows 
hampered by ultra-specific premises: 
“Monk”’s search for the detective’s 
wife’s killer and “Lost”’s deserted 
island, for example. This is another.

Don’t get me wrong, the show was 
endlessly entertaining in its first few 
seasons. Its success not only single-
handedly dispelled the notion that Neil 
Patrick Harris (the womanizing Barney 
Stinson) was doomed to be a child 
star forever, but also brought some 
of the greatest catchphrases to hit the 
pop culture lexicon, from “Suit up!” 
to “Legen — wait for it, I hope you’re 
not lactose intolerant because the next 
word is — dairy. Legendary!”  

Yes, those laughs belong to Barney, 
making the show more of a Neil 
Patrick Harris showcase than an 
ensemble comedy. Nonetheless, it’s 
been successful to the tune of over 
eight million viewers and has enjoyed 
a six-season run (and counting) simply 
because of how believable the charac-
ters seem to be. 

The show follows the lives of five 
close friends living in New York. The 
story is tied together by the lovelorn 
exploits of the protagonist Ted, who 
spends the better part of six seasons 
looking for his future wife. Each 
30-something character comes com-
plete with a detailed backstory, spoof-
ing the trends of the ’90s. (There’s 
nothing like watching Marshall sport-
ing a rat tail and bopping along to 
“500 Miles” in his Fiero.) And it’s hard 
to discount the spot-on relationship 
descriptions — in every affair, there is 
always a “reacher” and a “settler,” and 
the “reacher” is never the one to break 
it off. Sound familiar?

Faithful viewers have been privy 
to the gradual evolution of characters 
(And the decline in the attractive-
ness of Jason Segel. Seriously, what 
happened?) and in-between slap bets 
and sword fights, the crew had to con-
front heavier topics like the death of 
Marshall’s father and the discovery of 
Barney’s. 

But it’s gone on far too long. 
It’s hard to take recent characters 
like Jennifer Morrison’s Zoey seri-
ously when you know that she isn’t the 
mother. Her storyline, in particular, 
has been all over the place this season 
— her devious character disappears 
for several episodes midseason only to 
come back as a close friend. Otherwise

British director rehashes old tales from behind the camera

F
or most of us, a childhood surrounded by puppets is the stuff 
of nightmares. In the mind of an innocent, the methodical 
movements of marionettes, ever suspended on their nimble 
strings, turn the dolls into zombies — life-like forces capable 
of “Chucky”-style treachery, even as they depict happily ever 

afters. 
Joe Wright, director of the upcoming film “Hanna” (as well as the 

Oscar-nominated “Atonement” and “Pride & Prejudice”), was born into 
this dichotomy. His parents founded the Little Angel Theatre in the 
Islington borough of London, where they presented classic fairytales 
through the strange and sometimes eerie medium of marionettes. 

If his own creative work is any indication, the paradox of the night-
mare and the fable held a lasting effect on Wright. “Hanna” follows the 
plight of a 16-year-old girl, played by “Atonement”’s Saoirse Ronan, 
raised in the isolated wilds of Finland by her ex-CIA agent father, Erik 
(Eric Bana). Erik trains his daughter to be the perfect assassin, eventu-
ally sending her out into the real world to kill or be killed, tracked by a 
stilettoed CIA operative (Cate Blanchett). 

 Joe Wright, dressed in a blue suit with gray oxfords (no tie or 
socks), spoke with the Guardian at the Se Hotel in downtown San Diego 
about this twisted, modern-day fable, as well as his own humble begin-
nings. 

 “[Fairy tales] teach young people about the potential hurdles they 
might face and the darkness in the world,” Wright said. “I like those ele-
ments… and I wanted to invest ‘Hanna’ with that.”

Following the Brothers Grimm narrative of the heroine breaking free 
of parental (or supernatural) restraint, Wright crafts Hanna as a con-
temporary Rapunzel, exploring the real world for the first time. Only, 
Hanna’s ditched the romance for Angelina Jolie-style action. Wright 
further modernizes the parable through an explosive Chemical Brothers 
soundtrack.

“I went to their first London gig in 1992 at a nightclub called Ra 
Ra’s above the Saxon Shoe Shop in Islington, London,” he said. “They 
blew my mind. I’ve followed them ever since. I’m a bit of a groupie, I’m 
afraid. So when I had the opportunity to work with a modern score and 
a modern band, [that] was very exciting to me. So I called them up and 
they came on board.”

Wright’s own involvement with the film came through Ronan, who 
brought the script specifically to him after their previous collaboration 
on 2007’s “Atonement.”  Wright often chooses to work with the same 
group, such as actress Keira Knightly, who has appeared in two of his 
works.

“I like working with the same people, includ-
ing those behind camera as well as in front of 
camera,” he said. “I like the family feeling and 
developing creative relationships with people, 
rather than having to start again every time you 
work with someone.”

Unlike his character Hanna, Wright was not 
reared in the desolate, snowy woods — though 
he still had his fair share of adolescent hurdles to 
overcome. Wright suffers from dyslexia, a learn-
ing disability that impairs a person’s fluency in 
reading and writing. He said that, though the 
disability was initially challenging, it eventually 
proved to be a gift that contributed to his love 
for cinema.

“Because I couldn’t read, I sought education 
in other areas,” he said. “I looked to film to edu-
cate me. I’m told dyslexics see patterns in alter-
native ways. We find other ways of organizing 
the world that other people don’t.”

For Wright, who was always interested in the 
visual arts, directing was a natural career choice 
— though some of his earliest motives weren’t so 
highbrow.

“When I was 16, [I thought] I might be able 

to get a girlfriend if I was into films,” he joked. 
Wright eventually ditched the problems he 

had with language by interpreting it through the 
camera lens. Apart from “Hanna,” the director’s 
feature films have all been literary adaptations. 
His next project, “Anna Karenina,” starring Keira 
Knightly and scripted by Tom Stoppard, contin-
ues the trend.

“Being dyslexic, it was assumed I was stupid 
or lazy when I was a kid,” Wright said. “Doing 
these adaptations is a way of disproving that 
point. And also, learning about language and 
literature is something I love.”

 He also finds working with set material more 
satisfying than complete creative freedom. 

 “I like working with book adaptations 
because they set a boundary for you. And I 
find limitations liberating sometimes,” Wright 
said. “Whereas with an original screenplay, the 
options are so infinite, that one sometimes suf-
fers from an ‘options for options’ paralysis, where 
you don’t know what to do or where to move.”

After 14 years of directing, Wright can’t see 
himself in any other seat but the director’s chair. 

“I tried to be a furniture restorer for a while 
but the dust got to me, so I had to become a film 
director instead.” 

Wright Discusses Origins of  “Hanna”
▶ wright from page 7

touching scenes, like the infamous 
hallway phone kiss, are instantly 
dampened by the fact that Zoey will 
soon be gone, just like all the others.

If “How I Met Your Mother” was 
an open-ended, character-based 
show like “Friends” or “Seinfeld,” 
things might be different. It would 
just be an enjoyable weekly snippet 
into the characters’ lives, without the 
anticipation of wondering how long 
the producers can drag it on until 
Ted and his wife actually meet. 

And it certainly doesn’t help 
matters that Ted, the hero we’re sup-
posed to be rooting for, is one of 
the most tiresome lead characters 
on television (“It’s pronounced, 
Encyclo-PAY-dia.”) 

While it’s fun to have an over-
arching story tie the series together, 
some of the best episodes have noth-
ing to do with the mythology of how 
Ted met his wife. Take the Slap Bet, 
the infamous episode where Robin 
Sparkles — Robin’s Canadian pop 
star alter-ego — was introduced, and 
Showdown, featuring Barney in “The 
Price is Right.” 

Arguably, this show could break 
out of the bonds of the “mother” 
theme, but like most HIMYM fans, 
I think the final words of the show 
should be “And that kids, is how 
I met your mother.” Though I’m 
annoyed by the constraints of the 
premise, I would rather the show fol-
low it out to the end.

Of course, the renewal is out of 
my hands. But I’ll continue watching 
as long as it takes — until “the One” 
comes along — and I’m sure the pro-
ducers know that.

HIATUS THURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9

E nglish producer Stephen Wilkinson (aka Bibio) began his recording 
career with 2005‘s fi, a col-
lection of gently processed 
acoustic guitar compositions. 
Six years and five albums 
later, Wilkinson’s latest release 
shows he’s in an entirely new 
place. Though he remains 
dedicated to the detailed 
textures and analog recording 
that made his earlier albums 
so rewarding, Mind Bokeh 
finds Wilkinson embrac-
ing a louder, more eclectic 
approach to electronic music. 

Incorporating African 
funk, smooth jazz and the 
kind of laid-back, metronom-
ic L.A. beat music normally 
associated with producers 
like Flying Lotus, the 12 
tracks on Mind Bokeh intro-
duce a refreshing synthesis 
of contemporary electronica 
and the pastoral textures 
found on Bibio’s past work. 
“Wake Up!,” for instance, 
pairs an Eastern string riff 
with a crisp bass and vulner-
able, lilting vocal melodies. 
Album standout “K Is For 
Kelson” is an afro-beat groove 
the likes of what might hap-
pen if Fela Kuti were enlisted 
to soundtrack a children’s 
cartoon.

Bokeh is set apart from 
the works of Bibio’s contem-

poraries by Wilkinson’s  lush 
layering of sounds. “Anything 
New” begins as a typical sam-
ple-based dance track, then 
suddenly veers into a soaring 
jazz-fusion flute melody that 
melds with the song’s com-
pressed funk samples. 

The same mastery of tex-
tural interplay also shows up 
on opener “Excuses,” where 
a massive, fuzzy beat collides 
with a wall of reverbed-
out synthesizer and field 
recordings. The beat drops 
like any formulaic, post-
millennial dubstep groove, 
but the tracks shine with 
ingenuity when coupled with 
Wilkinson’s soundscapes. 
Often, the recordings feel as if 
they’ve been woven together 
from our own nostalgic sonic 
memories — from the sound 
of rain falling to the intimate 
plucking of a steel-string 
guitar. 

There are plenty of elec-
tronic producers with an ear 
for space and composition, 
but few integrate crisp and 
disparate textures with such 
effortlessness. Wilkinson’s 
newfound dialog between 
organic and synthetic proves 
both completely innovative 
and completely compelling.

English Producer Swaps Understated 
Electronica For Jazz-Synth Jams

F or those who don’t know Wiz, he’s what Kid Cudi would be after  
a year of intensive therapy 
(or a shitload of ecstasy). 
Wiz’s motto: Everything 
goes down easier with a bag 
of Mary Jane, a harem of 
hoes and a catchy melody. 

It’s a credo that the 
Pittsburg native only par-
tially adhered to on his 
third and most commercial 
release, Rolling Papers. 

On an album dominated 
by near-indiscernable slow 
jams, repetitive drunk-ditty 
“Black and Yellow” is a 
pleasant departure, featur-
ing an ’80s synth that coats 
Wiz’s uncharacteristically 
energetic, speedy flow while 
he chuckles about “do[ing] 
it big.” 

As a haunting whistle 
sounds off in the back of 
“On My Level,” Wiz trans-
ports listeners into DGAF 
bliss, as he raps about 
bitches, drinking and green 
(both kinds), assisted by a 
grimy Too $hort. 

On G-funk “Top Floor,” 
a warped voice sample pops 
over Wiz’s lower pitched 
drawl, while he brags about 
banging some ho “like a 
grown up” — bridging the 
gap between hustler and 
hip-hop icon with the same 

vetted swag as the hemp 
master-in-chief, Snoop 
Dogg.

But a pimp daddy’s 
work is never done, and 
Wiz’s backhand could use a 
little work. An overwhelm-
ing portion of tunes are 
uncomfortably interwoven 
with simpering dickless 
Bruno Mars sentiment; 
“Roll Up,” the tatted rapper 
monotonously croons to his 
babygirl, “Whenever you 
call baby, I’ll roll up” — the 
lyrics limply promise a reli-
able delivery that the song’s 
vanilla backbeat and uni-
form, robotic melody fails 
to provide.  

Others were gutted 
entirely; on “Wake Up,” the 
artist sings with strained, 
smoky vocal chords, while 
an eerie otherworldly note 
hums in the background, 
bookended by overpro-
duced pop-synth cho-
ruses resembling a Pac-Man 
video game theme song. 
And “The Race” is an unre-
markable snoozer, touting a 
slow, pleasantly forgettable 
beat, representative of the 
album’s overarching theme:  
elevator music. 

We’ll pass — without 
taking a puff.

W ith “Femme Fatale,” the dethroned princess of pop is a club queen 
on a mission: to grind/booze 
herself away into oblivion 
’til daybreak. (Or, as Spears’s 
production team might have 
us believe, the end of the 
world.)

The album presses further 
down the stiletto-beaten 
path of Spears’s last two 
efforts, 2008’s “Circus” and 
2007’s critically acclaimed 
“Blackout.” Here, a sense of 
frenetic urgency bars any 
pause for meditative balladry: 
there’s no graver concern 
than the outcome of a night 
on the dance floor, save 
whatever immediately follows 
— though, as suggested on 
the infectious, shameless “Up 
‘n’ Down,” Britney doesn’t 
exactly require a pillow. 

Each of Britney’s last 
three releases has leaned less 
on her famously thin vocals, 
though the results here are 
arguably the most compel-
ling of all: beyond the miles 
of auto-tune and requisite 
breathy come-ons are a 
dozen or so club bangers that 
are as good an excuse for 
an impromptu dance party 
as any of what pop’s leading 
ladies have offered up lately, 
if not better. 

“Gasoline” and “Big Fat 

Bass” in particular — both of 
which find Spears rekindling 
her long-running affinity for 
smutty metaphor — shine 
brightest in a trove of pop-
music gems. The latter fea-
tures will.i.am of the Black 
Eyed Peas playing “bass” 
opposite Britney’s treble. (It 
doesn’t take a BA in English 
Lit to figure out the playful 
symbolism). 

Spears herself, granted, 
contributes little to the allure. 
“Femme Fatale” is a triumph 
almost entirely of her pro-
ducers, the list of whom 
reads like a who’s who of 
pop-music tastemakers over 
the last few years: Dr. Luke, 
the Black Eyed Peas’ will.i.am 
and Max Martin (who’s been 
pulling the strings since 
Britney’s “…Baby One More 
Time” days) are but a few of 
the puppeteers. 

Styles range accordingly, 
from thundering dubstep 
(see first single “Hold it 
Against Me”) to breathy, 
mid-tempo experimentation 
(“How I Roll”). 

Soul-wrenching autobi-
ography it’s not, but after six 
major releases and years of 
tabloid scrutiny, Spears still 
makes a damn impressive 
blank canvas.

Starter Guido Knudson (3-2) 
gave up six runs on seven hits in six 
innings of work to take the loss.

The Tritons held on for the win 
in a wild game that saw the starting 
pitcher from both teams taken out 
before the fifth inning.

Matt Hubbard went 3-for-3 with 
two RBI; UCSD got RBI from six dif-
ferent players and the Tritons held on 
in a game that featured 23 hits. Triton 
starter Greg Selarz gave up six runs 
in just 3 2/3 innings, but Dominguez 
starter Sean Wardour wasn’t much 
better with five runs allowed in only 
three innings of work. Selarz was off 
the hook for the loss, however, with 
a huge six-run fourth inning from 
the Tritons.

Eric Abraham (1-0) pitched one 
inning of scoreless relief to pick up 
the win.

With the bottom of the Triton 
rotation struggling of late, manager 
Dan O’Brien decided to shake things 
up a bit. It paid off, with Jeff Rauh 
getting the win in his first start since 
2009 as the Tritons blanked the Toros 
to earn a series split. 

In only the second start of his 
career, Ruah (1-0) allowed seven hits 
and no runs while striking out seven 
in 5 2/3 innings. Reliever Elias Tuma 
went the rest of the way to complete 
the shutout for the Tritons. 

Center-fielder Danny Susdorf 
went 2-for-3 with two runs and Evan 
Kehoe had a two-run triple to open 
up the Tritons’ four-run fifth inning.

MARch 24
UC San Diego 5,

Tim Shibuya went the distance to 
pick up the win and become UCSD’s 
all-time innings leader.

Shibuya (6-1) matched his career 
high in strikeouts with 11 and allowed 
five hits while walking none. UCSD 
had 14 hits in the game, but left 10 
runners stranded. Evan Kehoe went 
4-for-4 with two RBI, and left-fielder 
Aaron Bauman went 3-for-5 with two 
doubles and an RBI. Second baseman 
Grant Bauer made his first appear-
ance in 2011 after battling an injury 
through the early part of the season, 
and showed no signs of rust as he 
went 2-for-4 with a run.

Shibuya has now pitched 366 
1/3 innings for UCSD, passing Jose 
Navarro’s previous record of 364 
innings set from 2003 to 2006. 

MARch 25
UC San Diego 2,

The Tritons received a stellar 
performance from starter Guido 
Knudson, but needed a ninth-inning 
rally to secure the win. 

Knudson allowed six hits over 
eight innings, although two came in 
the sixth to give the Broncos a run. 

But Pomona starter Erick Ruvalcaba 
was similarly brilliant, giving up just 
three hits in six scoreless innings. 

In the bottom of the ninth, pinch 
hitter Nick Hom was twice hit by 
a pitch, but the home plate umpire 
judged that Hom did not do enough 
to get out of the way. Hom then 
doubled to left-center, and pinch hit-
ter Scott Liske walked. Evan Kehoe 
moved both runners up 90 feet with 
a sacrifice, then pinch hitter Blake 
Tagmyer drove in the tying run with a 
single. Grant Bauer was intentionally 
walked to load the bases, and after 
a strikeout, Aaron Bauman came up 
with all bases loaded. Pomona pitcher 
Jake Reed threw a high fastball that 
nicked the top of the catcher’s mitt, 
and Liske came in for the winning 
run on a passed ball. 

Elias Tuma (3-0) picked up the 
win with a hitless ninth inning.

MARch 26 (GAMe 1)
UC San Diego 8, 
Cal Poly Pomona 7, 11 innings

Kyle Saul homered to right field in 
the top of the 11th inning to give the 
Tritons the go-ahead run, and UCSD 
held on for the win.

The Tritons had four home runs 
in the game, but once again struggled 
on the mound to keep the score tied 
7-7 after the seventh inning. Catcher 
Kellen Lee had three RBI off two 
home runs, and Aaron Bauman 
added his second long ball of the 
year. Both teams had 17 hits in the 
game, although both left nine run-
ners stranded as well. Triton starter 
Greg Selarz was roughed up for the 
second straight start, giving up five 
runs on 10 hits in 4 2/3 innings. But 
the Tritons were all over Pomona 
starter Ryan Dunn as well,  forcing 
him out after four innings and five 
runs surrendered.

After all the fireworks early in the 
game, the bats went quiet after the 
seventh inning as neither team could 
get a run across. Saul’s solo shot to 
lead off the top of the 11th gave the 
Tritons the lead, and Elias Tuma (4-0) 
handled the Broncos in the bottom of 
the inning to seal the win.

UC San Diego 1

Jeff Ruah’s second start of the year 
didn’t go nearly as well as the first, 
and the Triton offense was sluggish 
as the Broncos prevented the Tritons 
for a sweep.

Ruah (1-1) gave up five runs on 
seven hits in five innings, with a five-
hit four-run fifth inning giving the 
Broncos a 5-0 lead. The Tritons pulled 
one back in the top of the sixth with 
an RBI double from Nick La Face, but 
UCSD could muster nothing more in 
the shortened seven-inning game.

The Tritons are now 20-8 overall 
and 13-7 in CCAA play. The team 
suffered eight losses last season as 
well. The Tritons have slipped to No. 
10 in the latest national rankings.

The Tritons now face a four-game 
series this weekend against Cal State 
LA, with games on Thursday and 
Friday in Los Angeles and a double-
header at home on Saturday, begin-
ning at noon. 

Tritons Drop to No. 10 in Rankings
▶ BASEBALL, from page 12

the second game of the double-
header gave the Toros an early 
2-0 lead, and couldn’t get enough 
offense to close the gap.

The Tritons mustered two hits 
in the second inning, with Woofter 
and McQuaid getting on base, but 
the two were left stranded.  

It wasn’t until the sixth inning 
that the Tritons recorded a run, 
when Romero swung for a single 
and scored off of a Nicole Spangler 
single. The Tritons went three up, 
three down in the seventh inning 
to end the game. Jen Manuel 
(2-1) took the loss after allowing 
two runs on five hits over 4 2/3 
innings.

Sepulveda and Romero went 

2-for-3, while Woofter went 2-for-
4 in the Tritons’ 7-0 win over the 
Toros on Saturday. 

The Tritons opened the game 
with a run from Esther Strom off 
a Woofter RBI.  

UCSD pitcher Camille Gaito 
(13-1) kept the Toros scoreless, 
pitching a full seven innings for 
the Tritons, allowing just three 
walks and three hits while record-
ing three strikeouts.

The Tritons got back on the 
board in the fifth inning with a 
single brought by Nicole Spangler 
in Romero and Sepulveda. 

UCSD finished the Toros off 
with a four-run sixth inning.  
Rhiannon Ousley earned an RBI 
on a sacrifice bunt that scored 
Woofter. Romero followed with a 
single to left field, which sent two 
more runners in to score. Kristin 
Omori, pinch hitting for Strom, 
bunted to bring Romero home, 
collecting her first RBI.

UC San Diego 5, 
Cal State San Bernardino 2

The last game of the series was 
a pitching battle, with only three 
hits from the Tritons and Toros 
collectively. 

UCSD had two of the hits, 
both by Kris Lesovsky, but the 
Tritons stranded her on both occa-
sions and remained scoreless. 

Dominguez was once again 
able to capitalize on a bit of bad 
luck from the Tritons, as Krista 
Gould got on base in the fourth 
inning after being hit by a pitch 
and Jessica Hall was walked. 
Stephanie Jimenez followed by hit-
ting a double to right field, which 
sent Gould and Hall in to score.

Tess Granath (5-4) took the 
loss, giving up the lone hit but 
walking four in 5 2/3 innings of 
work.

18-year history of the event. 
Fogarty wasn’t the only UCSD ath-

lete to make waves at the high-profile 
meet, which featured many of the 
Division-I schools in California and 
Nevada. Junior Nick Howe threw the 
second-best mark of his career in the 
javelin throw, coming in at 222’2”. 
Despite this, the defending Division-II 
champion won the event by just four 
centimeters over Cal Poly Pomona’s 
Lance Walkington.

UCSD saw a lot of success in the 
field events throughout the meet. 
Danielle Thu placed second in the 
hammer throw with a mark of 180’8”, 
losing only to UC Davis’s Chid 
Onyewuenyi. Theresa Richards placed 
sixth in the javelin throw with a toss 

of 131’1”. 
Caitlin Meagher took fifth in the 

400 hurdles with a time of 62.20, 
while Stephanie LeFever was eighth 
in the 100 hurdles, coming in at 14.53. 
LeFever was also fifth in the long jump 
with a mark of 19”0.5’. 

Junior Dustin Harris ran 1:52.42 
in the 800 meters, which was good 
enough for a fifth-place finish and 
NCAA provisional qualifier.

“That’s a huge breakthrough for 
Dustin,” Salerno said. “We’re really 
excited to see him keep running fast-
er.”

Ka Wai Ng also earned a provi-
sional qualifier, as he finished sixth in 
the triple jump with a mark of 47’7.25”. 

Defending NCAA D-I Indoor 
Track & Field champions San Diego 

State took the meet on the women’s 
side with 132 points. Long Beach State 
was top on the men’s side for the sec-
ond straight year, scoring 155 points. 
UCSD scored 56 points and 35 points, 
respectively. 

Salerno said he was happy with the 
way the team performed against the 
tough competition.

“It was pretty exceptional,” Salerno 
said. “To have our people competing 
at that level, head-to-head, and be 
successful, really is an inspiring thing.” 

The Tritons return to action this 
weekend at the Mangrum Invitational, 
a smaller meet hosted by Cal State San 
Marcos.

BASEBALL ROUNDUP SOFTBALL ROUNDUP
Feb. 26 (GAMe 1)

UC San Diego 4, 
Cal State San Bernardino 1

 
The Toros relied heavily on pitchers 

Lauren Harper and Stephanie Jimenez 
to shut out the No. 10-ranked Tritons.  

Neither team recorded a hit until 
the Toros put two runners on base in 
the third inning. It wasn’t until the fifth 
inning that the Tritons looked danger-
ous, when Caitlin Brown sent a single 
to right center. Emily McQuaid pinch-
ran for Brown, finding her way to third 
base off a Sarah Woofter ground-out 
that followed by a bunt from Jennifer 
De Fazio. With men on first and third, 
Katrin Gabriel tried a bunt for the 
RBI, but McQuaid was thrown out at 
home. Mya Romero lined out to end 
the inning.  

The Toros capitalized on a pair of 
Triton errors in the fifth and the sixth 
to collect two unearned runs and seal 
the win. Romero had a rough game, as 
her errors allowed both base runners 
that would eventually come around 
to score.

Camille Gaito (12-1) suffered her 
first loss of the season, allowing the 
two runs on three hits while going the 
distance.

A strikeout and a failed hit-and-run play 
killed a ninth-inning Triton rally as the Toros 
beat UCSD for just the second time in the 
teams’ last 11 meetings.

The Tritons trailed 4-1 to start the ninth 
inning, but a double by second baseman 
Blake Tagmyer and single by pinch hitter 
Nick Hom gave the Tritons runners second 
and third with no outs. Left-fielder Evan 
Kehoe then struck out, but pinch hitter Nick 
La Face punched an RBI single into left 
field to score Tagmyer. Third baseman Matt 
Hubbard produced another RBI single in the 
next at-bat to cut the Toros’ lead to 4-3 with 
runners on first and second. The Tritons 
called a hit-and-run with shortstop Garrett 
Tuck at the plate, but Tuck swung and missed 
and the runner was thrown out at third. Tuck 
then struck out to end the game.

Starter Tim Shibuya (5-1) took his first 
loss of the season, giving up four runs on 10 
hits in seven innings.

Dominguez shortstop Abel Medina went 
3-for-4 with five RBI — including a three-
run home run in the fifth inning — as the 
Toros downed the Tritons for the second 
straight day.

The game was tight early on, with each 
team scoring in the first inning and the Toros 
leading 3-2 going into the fifth inning. But 
Medina’s homer brought the score to 6-2, and 
the Tritons could only manage one hit after 
the fifth inning.

Fogarty Again
Breaks Sprint 
Records
By Liam Rose
Sports Editor

TRACK & FIELD — There doesn’t 
seem to be a limit on how fast sprint-
er Kelly Fogarty can go. The senior 
sprinter wowed again last weekend at 
the Cal/Nevada Championships, once 
more breaking her own school records 
in the 100- and 200-meter dash and 
beating out top competition. 

“At this point, I don’t think we’re 
going to be surprised by anything 
Kelly does,” men’s head coach Tony 
Salerno said. “She really dominated a 
field of pretty talented athletes.”

Fogarty ran 11.52 in the prelims of 
100-meter dash and 23.56 in the 200-
meter dash prelims, both on Saturday. 
Both times are UCSD records, and 
Fogarty came back on Sunday to win 
both events with times of 11.65 and 
23.63 in the finals. To put her times 
in perspective, her new record time 
would have made her sixth nationally 
last year — at the NCAA Division I 
Championships.

“The level she’s running at now is 
something pretty spectacular,” Salerno 
said. “For her to be as dominant as she  
was really impressive.”

Fogarty was unanimously chosen 
as female track athlete of the meet 
by the coaches, and is only the sec-
ond Triton to earn that honor in the
