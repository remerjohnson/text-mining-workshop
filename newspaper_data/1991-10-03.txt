Committee Fonned 
For Non-SAAC Groups 
• New Human Relations Advisory 
Committee will voice student concerns 
By EIIc Sct.mldt 
Associate News Editor 

Student groups that feel they are not being heard by the 
administration now have an avenue of expression through the 
newly-funned Human Relaaions Advisory Committee (HRAC). 

1be organization will speak through Anthony Jemison, 
Directorofthe Student Affirmative Action and Human Rela-
tions Program (formerly Student Affinnative Action). Ac-
cording to Jemison, HRAC is open to "those tuden! popula-
tions on campus oot represented by the Student Affinnative 
Action Committee (SAAC)." 

Jemison said student organization not made up of "legal" 
minorities cannot join SAAC, since SAAC "has a basis of 
members [of) populations recognized by the federal govern-
ment as being underrepresented." 

Groups such as the Lesbian, Gay & Bisexual Association 
(LGBA), who tried unsuccessfully to join SAAC last year, and 
the Union of Jewish Students have already contacted Jemison, 
who said they seemed interested. 

All student organizations who feel their views are not being 
heard are eligible for HRAC. 

Chandon Reddy, LGBA officer of internal affairs, said the 
LGBA will probably join the HRAC. "We're very excited that 
we'll be able to work in close contact with Anthony Jemison, 
who would be able to express our concerns to Vice-Chancellor 
[of Undergraduate Affairs Joseph] Watson," Reddy said. 

Reddy said he is also excited because the HRAC will 
"n=d,ive funding of some sort. " 

Reddy does not believe the HRAC was created as a second-
string alternative to being admitted to SAAC last year. "I think 
the [HRAC] introduces us as a complement to SAAC . . .

IRPS Graduate Students Found Scholarly Joumal 
• Unique academic publication to be frrst nationwide journal compiled by UCSD students 
By ..... ~ 
GuardilJn Reporter 

Thcfirst UCSDstudentacademic 
journal, to be published by graduate 
students in the International Rela-
tions and Pacific Studies (IRPS) 
program. is under development for 
its fU'Sl issue. 

1benewjoumal.calJedThdour-
nal of Environment and Develop-
ment, will focus on how govern-
menraI policies. businesses and other 
insdtutioos affect third world ec0-
nomic development and the envi-
rollment, according to IRPS gradu-
ate studenl Daniel Nielson. Nielson 
said that the first issue wiD be pub-

lished in April. 
Nielson. the Editor in Chief of 

the journal. said that while there are 
already policy journals which deal 
with the environment or with Third 
World development, The Journal 
of Environment and Development 
will be the first to specifically ad-
dress both issues. 

"While Third World countries 
are being pressured by the U.S. and 
others to improve their environ-
ment, the question is: how does a 
country both develop economically 
and protect the environment? Aca-
demics have not grappled with this 
questioo," Nielson said. 

For him, the environment and 
economic development are insepa-
rable issues. 

According to Nielson, the inspi-
ration for the journal derived from a 
class on international and environ-
mental policy taught by Gordon 
MacDonald, a leading scholar on 
the topic. 

MacDonald is said to have sug-
gested last spring that his students 
publish Jl journal oriented toward 
issues addressed by his class. 

Nielson said that the journal was 
established with MacDonald's and 
other professors' and administra-
tors' support. 1be students also have 

received grants from theInstituteon 
Global Conflict and Cooperation, 
the Scripps Institution of Oceanog-
raphy. IRPS and the Institute of the 
Americas. 

1be first issue of the journal will 
contain papers about an upcoming 
conference on Latin American En-
vironment and Hemispheric Tech-
nological Cooperation, sponsored 
by the Insitute of the Americas, ac-
cording to Nielson. 

He added that members of the 
journal staff work with the institute 
in selecting the papers to be pre-
sented in the journal.

wiIbout tryina to dissolve SAAC's purpose-
as an undenqxescnted group," Reddy said. 

Jemison aped. sayina the HRAC wiD 
provide a good forum for SAAC and other 
JI'OUPL However. he also said, "I don ',·think 
this is tbe best [the LGBA] is going to gec." 

Jemison said if the LGBAstiU wantsmem-
bership in SAAC, the HRAC couJ.d be "oncof 
the stones in the bUilding thai might eventu-
ally lead to them being considered a human 
rights organizalion." theRby a1Iowina the 
LGBA a door into SAAC. 

Jemison also said that, although SAAC 
membership eligibility is now narrowly de-
fined, "thar·s not to say thai that definition 
should not be ~cn a look at." 

Jemison commented on the LGBA's at-
tempt last year to gain SAAC membership. "I 
think they handled everything very appropri-
ately," he said "There were definitely things 
they would like to have done differently," he 
added. 

Reddy expressed caution on future at-
tempts at SAAC membership. "That all de-
pends on if we as an organizalion feel [mem-
bership] i~ needed at the momcnt," he said. 

At 1east one memberpfthe LGBA said he 
was interesled in fualR SAAC membership, 
saying "We can always try - and we can· 
keep on trying." 

Jemison feels the only disadvantage of the 
HRAC compared to SAAC, foUnded in the 
mid-I97Os, wJ1I be HRAC's age. "Initially, 
there is going to be some difference in that 
SAAC has a history •.• theR is • familiarity 
with SAAC." he said. . 

Accordirig to Reddy, HRAC isn't quite as 
good as SAAC would have been. ''The 
[HRAC]. while definitely a good 0rganiza-
tion. doesn't CJale for us willi we were 
pushing for in the LGBA: status as an 
undenepresented group on~.!' 

Reddy also believes the indirect tine of 

Director of Stud6nt AffIrmative Action 
Anthony .JemIson 
communication with Vice Chancellor Watson 
- through Jemison and Nick Aguilar, Direc-
tor of Special Services - leaves HRAC at a 
slight disadvantage. "A lot can be said or 
unsaid, or a lot can be left undone." Reddy 
added. 

Jemison said. though. that HRAC will be 
similar to SAAC in its capabilities and im-
pacts. "In tenns of their impact and involve-
ment with the administration. the impact and 
involvergent. they will have on campus is 
similar." he said. 

At this point, HRAC members "may want 
to focus on or do different things than 
[SAAq." 'I1!us. HRAC could be similar to 
SAACorcompletely different. depeooing on 
the members' needs. 

Jernisonsaid the idea for the HRACorigi-
nated with events I.t year. such as hate 

• crimes against the LGBA, LGBA' sattempt to 
gain SAAC status, And charges of censorship 
made by the Young Americans for Freedom 
(YAF). 
. Afterdiscussions betwenJemisoo.Aguilar 
and Vice-01anceJlor Watson. who approved 
of the group, Jemison began to set up the 
HRAC.

Dr. Watson said. "We have high expecta· 
tions for [HRAC] to survive as a means 10 
discuss and resolve problems . . . We hope 
members of the campus community will join 
with us." 

Mentioning rights violations of the LGBA 
with the alleged censorship of the self·pro-
claimed ultra-conservative Y AF may be un-
usual. but Jemison said both organizations are 
eligible to join HRAC. depending on the 
approval of HRAC members. 

While Reddy said that he personally is 
"excited about the diversity:' of HRAC, he 
doesn', quite "believe in who [Y AF is] and 
what they believe in." 

by Bill Watterson 

In Jemison's view. though, anything is 
possible, since. "to be honest. the structure of 
the organization has not yet been set." lbe 
first members of HRAC will mold it to their 
needs this quarter. 

'We will try to allow those members rof 
HRAC] to-set the direction of the focus." 

TIle hate crimes mentioned by lemison 
both initiated plans for HRAC and helped 
LGBA in the end. Reddy said. After the hate 
crimes publicity, people started to "come out 
of the closet." he said. LGBA 's membership 
doubled on the first day of this fall quarter.

• If Western governments 
really want to aid the Soviets, it 
should put its checkbook away 
and help develop a free market 
By Metthew Robl .. lon 
Associate Opinion Editor 

For a few days this summer it looked like the 
spectre of communism 'would get another chance to 
haunt Europe. But the courage of the Russian people 
and their most able leader, Boris Yeltsin. finally 
exorcised this spirit pe~y from the Soviet 
Union. 

Since then, the Russian people have brandished 
their gartic and wooden stakes, finally laying to rest the 
corpse of the Communist Party and ending lhe world's 

oldest social engineering experiment -
a horrific experiment born in the 
egalitarian quest for utopia. It has ended 
in utter failure and signaled a momen-
tous change in favor of democracy and 
liberty. 

Many different politicians and 
demagogues have attempted 10 exploit 
these rather extraordinary events by 
advocating economic aid to the Soviet 
Union to "nurture democracy." 

But before the Uniled States plunges 
full speed ahead and starts shoveling 
dollaCs into the economic abyss 
created by socialism. we should 
consider the consequences of such 
an action. If we truly wish to help 
the democratic forces with their 
newfound freedom, then it is 
necessary to evaluate the best 
method with which to 
help them. 

The traditional 
lnixlUre of good 
intentions and lots 
of money that has 
characterized the 
United States' 
handling of the Third 
World and many 
domestic questions, is not the answer. 
As one Austrian philosopher puts such 

ill-thought charity, "there is nothing more fatal than 
sentimental amateurism." The policy of heaping 
dollars on an ecOflQlllic fire would only hurt both the 
United States and the Soviet Union. 

In order to understand why this is the case. a IinIe 
economic reflection is necessary. The positive gains 
made in the Soviet Union over the past few years have 
J10I been the result of any particularly premeditated 
path toward democracy. 

What has brought about the rather remarkable 
changes, ironically, are the result of the twin jugger-
naulS of permroikLl and glasnost. let loose by 
Gorbachev in his effon to revitalize the economy and 
return face .to the ebbing legitimacy of the Communist 
Party. 

Very quiclcly, however, we witnessed the force of a 
veritable Pandora's box, as the iIIterests of the hard-

abe Soviets and abe Americans have 10 learn to 
live and wort IOpdIer because ~ is only 
one Eanh and we can'l afford to desIroy it with 
bombs. 

When he had finisbed, he stucIt 0Ul Ilia band. 
I shook il, but then he kissed mine and clasped 
it in both ~his hands before re~ it, and 
disappeared into the crowd. 

I just stood there for a moment. ponderina 
what he b.t said. and feeling extremely proud 
thai 1 b.t wlderstood as much of his Russian as 
I had. 

Just as the poBten sugest, people hold a 
wide ranae of views about the political 
situation. Some say the poIiticians_ simply 
p1ayinl power pmes 1IDOIl8 themselves while 
the general population suffers fJOm increasina 
COSIS for basic eaenIiIIs (rMions bepn in early 

September for items such as sugar and vodka). 
They watch TV and think il is all one sick 

joke because nodtinB ever chanp - except 
for the worse. 

To make matters worse. Gorbachev speaks 
with a heavy Ukranian accent and lacks proper 
pammar. Rumor has illhat his aides have 
adopted the same accent to avoid causing him 
embarrassment. 

No matter what the governmenl is doing or 
what the people think about it. daily life is still 
an etemal suuggIe for food and other necessi-
ties. 

As students, we 1ft fed edible. if bland, food 
(I swear 1"11 never complain aboul cafeteria 
food again) which costs pennies a meal. 

The exclJanae rare is absolutely obscene-

32 rubles to the dollar- and meals run from 
one to four robles. The average Soviet stands in 
endless lines wherever someone has something 
to sell. 

People sell fNilS, vegetables and the more 
I'II'e cartons of milk on Sb'eet comers, as well as 
in the stores. 

BUll really have no complaints. Everything 
is difficult 10 do here, including buying lhealer 
tickets or train tickets to anywhere, but you 
Ieam to adjust pretty quickly and develop a 
healthy measure of patience. 

Getting hot waler for showers and laundry is 
like playing - you'll pardon the pun -
Russian roulette, although we have it wooed 
out pretty much when we can get hot waler ... 
maybe. 

From my personal experience. lhe Soviets 
can get pretty much. whatever they need through 
complicated friend-of-a-friend networks, or by 
visiting Fin1and. although iI'S possible that I 
have only mel privileged Soviets. 

By and large, the most popular item is ice 
cream - a lhick, rich. somewhat bunery 
concoction, different from what we're used to. 
which Soviets will eat on the streets throughout 
the winter. 

Then there are those who are taking advan-
taae of the increasing touriSllrade to illegally 
earn far grealer salaries than the average Soviet. 

One man I met works as a!orlSovchik and 
said he earns 6,000 Nbles a day while his 
mother, who works for the stale, earns 400 
robles a day. His only goal in life is 10 make 
money. 

BUI his political views were very confusing 
to me. He admires greatly both Stalin and 
Lenin, even though the former was responsible 
for hundreds of thousands - possibly millions 
-of deaths. 

He reasoned that, under Stalin, at leasl the 
people had things to buy in the stores. and the 
only reason thaI Stalin killed those people was 
because they didn'l work. 

Bul when I asked him whether he preferred 
capitalism or communism, he replied capital-
ism, which he said he wants to come to the 
country. 

I don'l understand his logic. He idolizes 
Lenin. bul wants the country 10 be capitalistic. 

Go figure.

WIllI poIicymaIcen do not realize is that we

M«kd Mr~. We have to spend money on our 

own people. We have to take responsibility for 
- we have 10 take care of - our own people. 

Which brings me back 10 my firsl point. 
Perflaps the grealest loss in the collapse of lhe 
Soviet syslem is what the whole world will lose 
when their sense of colleclivism is replaced 
with our sense of individualism. 

After all, look at where this myth of indi-
vidualism has gotten us. One aircraft carrier 
COSIS more than the entire U.S. educalion 
budget. Again, the individual over the group. 

The itony of this position is lhat while 
George Bush is requiring the Soviets to diven 
their military budget to feed their people, he at 
the same lime insists that cuts in the U.S. 
military budgel will J10I lead to a peace divi-
dend. 

Maybe the fact is that while we're gloaling 
over the death of the Soviet empire. our own 
system lso'l thai far behind. 

As capitalism revs up to nan its final mile, 
the inequities and pain of the system IR 
beooming even more pronounced - no access 
to health care, high infant monaJity rates among 
minorities, CIUIIlbiing infrastnaclure and poor 
and dying public 1dIoo1s. 

The lack of a priVIIe world may have led to 
the Soviet demise, but the death of a public 
world in our counIry may be leading 10 ours. 
We may die from too much belief in our own 
myths of individualism.

In addition. aid that is senl 
through our government shores up 
insIilUlions that could 1101 exist, save 
for outside resources. 

Whatever govemment-to-gov-
emment transfers are made will in-
evilably involve us politically in 
making decisions about which 
groups 10 support - a potentially 
dangerous move . . 

Russian dissident Vladimir 
Bukovsky, writing about those who 
offer such resources or money says. 
"Forone thing. though their sympa-
thies are in the right place. in their 
Western lack. of feel for the ins and 
outs of Soviet reality they are fre-
quently unable to tell a KG Bagent, 
an oppol1unist, or even just a plain 
crook from a genuine democratic 
activist." 

Any money that is sent to the 
Soviet Union is immensely power-
ful, he adds. For example, $15,000 
can feed 100 Russian families for a 
year. hnagine the destabilizing effect

ftlCCivcs this kind m 0UISidc help. 
In a country that loves to talk 

about an even playina field. we wiD 
certainly creaIe a lot of poe holes if 
our actions conIinue. 

In addiIion. the connection to 
Weseem money and raoun:es ere-
aleS bitter rivalries, and incites jeal-

Bur the quesdon of aid to Ihe 
Soviet people is one that reveaber-
aleS ill Ihe AIDeriQn IIOUI. The im-
.. mBoris Yellsin.swdnaonrop 
ofae.nkurJialRIaian freedom, is 
1101 easily er1IIed faom Ihe memo,y 
of Americans. 

WhIt is left Ihen. to do to help? 
Creating a stable economy is of 

course a prerequisite if the Soviet 
Unioo is to be helped aJona the road 
10 freedom. The old pricing system 
is defunct because of fWr~stroiluls 
fail," to give face to the Conunu-
nist party. The question is whether 
the Soviets shouJd set prices. or let 
the market forces dictate output. 

Remember. the problem withlnY 
socialist device of government in-
terference with the market is that it 
attempts to make the infinite num-
ber of decisions and calculations 
made by thousands of people weigh-
ing the costs of their actions. IJ es-
sentially tries to paint a IlWterpiece 
with a broom. Every socialist is 
convinced that he can touch up the 
Mona Lisa. 

Prices may reach their natural 
levels by the laws of supply and 
demand. But in order to guarantee 
that these prices do not fluctuate 
drastically, it is important that prop-
erty be privatized. 

It is impossible for capital to 
flow to needed areas of production 

The ucsn Guardian. 

if it is blocked from investing in 
profitable and useful companies. In 
otherwords, it isnol possible forthe 
eoonomyto be revitalized ~I capi-
tal can be invested in plants and 
other physical areas of production. 

Private property also allows die 
conversion of currency into real. 
leIS, which opens the door to des-
penIieIyneeded forei ... inveslment. 
Yes. private property is often oon-
sidered a bed WOld - a leftover 
from die moribund Manistcritique 
of CIpitaIism. Bur until foreian cur-
rencies can buy real ISseIS -land 
and Clpital- and employ labor in 
profitable venlUres, rubles will oon-
tinue to be wonbless. 

The~. however. is that 
priVlleproperty and the free market 
are proven to be very efflCienl in 
allocalingresources. They are much 
more efficient than any entrenched 
government bureaucrat. The Soviet 
Union has an opportunity to offer 
privatization to all its citizens be-
cause few original owners are still 
alive or even known. 

To wait for the privatization of 
property will only allow those left in 
power to aggregate productive re-
sources and ultimately injure re-
fonn. The moral high ground of the 
big spender is easily demolished by 
a little subtle economic thinking. 

There are those who favor the 
nebulous phrase "nurturing democ-
racy," and oppose these fundamen-
tal economic answers. They are the 
true enemies of liberty and democ-
racy. They may have good inten-
tion but their actions speak other-
wise. And we all know with what 
the road to hell is paved, 

These the same hypocrites who, 
instead of pUlling their energy into 
actually helping their neighbor, sit 

lazily in their sections and classes 
and pontiftcalc to the masses that 
government should do this or do 
more. 

They want egalitarian justice in-
stead of freedom, !hey want Big 
Brother because they do 1101 trust 
their fellow Americans. This is the 
same 10taIitarian mentality that put 
the hard-line conservative conunu-
nists inlO power in the first place.

Running Back to Reglonals 
• Men's cross countty returns eight of top 10 rumers 
from last year, while women may look to newcomers 
IIrClnR ..... 
ASSCICI«e Spotts EIIttor 

If you talk 10 Head Coec:h Mark 
Stanfonh about this year's men's 
and women's cross c:ounb)' teams., 
you'll hear a man who is c:onfidenI 
but realistic: about hfs squads. 

Stanforth says boIh teams should 
be "pretty competitive," and he ex-
pects them to finish about "the same 
this year" as IasI season. 

Considering both teams finished 
second in the region last year, that 
isn't 100 shabby. 

Hernandez., Nathan Johnson and 
Fussum KefleziBhi. 

While Stanfonh anticipates that 
Ihe "reIuming men should be able 10 
cany Ihe Ioad.," he says that the 
women will have "more new people 
in the top ten," and could run thin if 
injuries lake lhcir toll. 

Michelle Conlay, one of the Tri-
tons' top runners who placed firsl in 
the region Iwo years ago, is already 
having shin problems. 

In fact, Stanforth says, ConJay 
"hasn't competed yet" due to the 
injury and "might nOl be able to run 
al all." 

With Conlay out for an indeti-
, nite period, Stanforth is looking to 

two new runners. Erin Adams and 
Tracy Cole, 10 pick up Ihe s1ack.. 
But, as Stanforth explains. boch 
women "have never rwt III all" 

While Adams academically is. 
junior, she is a sophomore as far as 
eligibility requirements ~ con-
cerned 

She has been on the crew team 
and, according toScanfonh, is ahead 
of the returning runners. Cole is a 
senior. 

In lenns of comparing each indi-
vidualleam 10 last year's, Stanforth 
says lhc men as a "whole group [are] 
better than last year." He says the 
men will "run [closer] logether"than 
last year's team. 

Stanfonh has similar comments 
in comparing the women's team to 
last year's. If Stanforth's prediction comes 

true, it would be the fifth consecu-
tive year the men's team has fin-
ished firsl or second in the region, 
and the fourth straight year for the 
women. 

Again, not too shabby . 
Stanfonh also points out that the 

current rank of both teams - 16th 
for the men and 17th for the women 
- are "realistic" and "accurate." 
He hopes that by the end of the 
season. those rank will move up 
into "th 10-15 range." 

GuMIIn Ale I'hI*I 
Eric Kinney may redshirt this year. 

Although the men lost their top 
two runners from last year in Stefan 
Wynn-who's studying abroad-
and Mike Fox,they will return their 
top eight remaining runners. Lead-
ing the pack should be Sam Gwynn, 
Steve Stuart and Steve Fencer. A 
fourth potential returner, Eric 
Kinney . i till questionable. 
Stanforth says that he may red hin 
this year.

He says that heexpect5 this year's 
squad 10 "run much closer together 
than last year's." . 

According to Stanforth, having 
squads running closertogethercould 
have a h'idden benefit in that the 
team won 'I be relying on just a few 
people to get lhc job done. 

Moreover, he also points out that 
hedoesn', want people "to gel hung 
up on highs and lows," and ruMing 
closertogethermay help to decrease 
that kind of thinking. 

Stanforth sees the intensity level 
of both squads "increasing as the 
season goes 00." And, in keeping 
with the team concept, Stanforth 
also expects both the new people 
and the returners "to do everylhing 
they can lin order] to do the best 
they can."

Dooo DANNEVIX lJKES BEING UN-
PREDICTABLE. 

One player likes to teU the story 
of the time lase year when the Tri-
tons found themaelves 81 a crucial 
point in a bitter, hard-fouaht mEh. 
Dllnnevik, who likes to tinker wilb 
the linHIp lIrfWIy. decided thar it 
was aJOOd time to expeailDClIt with 
Van Duyne II Idler. 

Van Duyne is III 0UIIide hiaer 
- one ~the belt in Divilioa m-
wboee oft'ensive IkiIII _ c:oncen-
tnfed on doina one Ihina: han.ner-
ina the ball. Her experience II a 
Idler was minimal 81 belt. But iI 
worked. 

Dooo DANNI!VIK lJICI!S 10 DmMl-
DAm. 

"We always like SO have the CUI 
side clthe [Triton] JYIIlIO thai the 
other team has to IooIt II the wall 

with the banners - the champion-
ship bamers - on it while we're 
bein, introduced. Tha\'ssomething 
we like to do. I mean. you can 'I help 
but notice them." he ays. "To me. 
they would be unsenIina. 

"I think we intimidaIe our~ 
nems. We're very disciplined. Like 
our wamHIpL We have. warm-up 
that·s choreographed. It looks very 
sharp and disciplined. I('alike how 
before a ~I pme. they do 
abe Ihrcc-mM weave. We wort. on 
it, and we actually pnctice il. 

"When ocher ama oome out on 
the floor for warm-ups. they grab a 
ball and ~ playing pepper. BUIll

Ibis weekend. our girls ~ so in-
tense lhIlocherteaml juIa IIOOdmel 
WIICbed II we did our warm-ups. I 
IhinIt you ean be inIimidIIing by 
being disciplined. .. 

DouoDANNEVIK UICPS PEItA'CI1ON. 
"I'm a perfectionist by nature." 

he says. Acx:onIin, to Dannevik, 
staying motivated in romps like the 
one earlier this ye. against UC 
Santa Cruz when UCSD allowed 
the Banana Slugs a grand Iotal of 
three poinU in three games isn'l as 
hard as you would think.. 

"The pI.yers take so much pride 
in the way they play mel their stan-
dard of exc:eIIence is 10 high that 
they get pisIed when they're not 
perfect. 

"Wc'repreay haldon ourselves. 
and we ClOIIIider a Iefdown very 
depIaIina." he says. 

"Plus, they don', want toface me 
iflhey've given a hBtf-assed effort. " 

FINALl. y. Douo DAJIINEVIK UKES 
mEIII CHANCES. 

"We set • soaI • the beginning 
of the year to win the national cham-
pionship. and we have • good shol at 
it" 

And Doug would like that. A lot.

of his own for the pme. 

Gerhudl punched the Triron 
sc:orecanI apin, four minutes be-
fen hIIIftime. Romey asaialed on 
the play. 

"We boIh kicked il in." Romey 
_ "But Mike 101 mosl of it." 
Romey t.d CWO shots for tbe pmc 
and his fira p of the season, 
while Gerhardt came away with 
three shots orf p. 

1bc shot came aboul afler a 
missed penalty kick. the result of 

• one of I S Crusader fouls. UCSD 
spilled even more blOod with 16 
fouls. 

Ncitheranhesilalcdinexpress-
ing itself vocally. Point Lorna's 
Mark VOSCI and Slevcnson were 
each handed yellow cards after mi-
nor lanbUms. 

Head Coech Derek Armstrong 
was nonchalanl about the win. 
"We've never had to worT)' about 
[beating] Point Lorna." shrugged 
Annstrong who was still obviously 
pleased. 

Th.ings are definilely looking up 
forUCSD. 

It seems the TrilOrlS have re-
bounded, wiming six of their last 
seven. 1beir improvement has kepi 
the Tritons floating safely above the 
.500 mark at 6-3-0. Annstrong has 
managed CO do all this while franti-
cally shuftlinahis midfJdd, looking 
for that map: set of player'S. 

"The offense isn'l playing 
simple," Annstrong insisted. "Our 
lack of experience makes for an 
ineffective, compIicatcd offense." 
Indeed, the Triton haIfbKks looked 
like lost sheep.1eaving the forwards 
to bring up lheir own balls. 

On the rare tUnes the offense 
managed 10 punch through. f110SI of 

theforwardshot~ed it,anchook 
'bed shots. The Tritons only man-
aged to convert on two out of 11 
shots. 

In addition, the UCSD offense 
failed to cooven some·almost guar-
anlieedopportunities. (]Iris Hanssen 
missed a penalty shot at tbe end of 
the second half. 

No big deal, since the game was 
in the fridae anyway. 

BUI Hanssen missed the entire 
goal. PedIaps the Triton forward 
was distracted by Crusader goa1ie 
Mark RuueU, who waved his hands 
up and down before die kick, not 
unlike die K..-Kid and his crane 
Dlllluever. .

die ta1ents of Brown IDd Goodric:h 
with lUI year's rehlminl team. 
Among die moll prominent mem-
bers is junior Kevin Vance who 
earned All-American honorable 
meobon honors last yearandquickly 
emerged IS UCSO's offensive 
leader. 

The Tritons third faction fea-
lUreS what Harper caUs "one of the 
finest fJeshrnan classes [UCSD] has 
ever had." Leading the group is 
Michael Nalu. 

Nalu, a first-le8m high school 
All-American, is having some 
trouble dealing with a harder train-
ing regimen and bigger, stronger 
collegiate players, but, according 10 
Harper, he shows excellent p0ten-
tial. 

Harper admits that bringing the 
tine levels together will take some 
time. 

"I think we 'readmittedly behind 
schcduIe in tenns of having that all 
mesfl, but dlere' s definitely a strong 
feeling that it's going 10 click," 
Harper said. 

"When it does, watch out. This 
team will be able to beat anybody." 

The Tritons, says Harper, are 
about three-quanen; of the way 10 
where they want to be in 1991. 

Gre& GoodrIch 
UCSO's losses thus far, Harper as-
serts, are die result of missccloppor-
tunities. Opportunities, bellys, that 
can beain 10 work in the Tritons 
favor, once dley reach their full po-
eenbal. "You can plainly see that 
this le8m is ready to bust through," 
Harper said. 

The Tritons - who finished last 
season ranked 16th in the nation-
have alre.dy been IWIked as high as 
lOch in 1991 andarecurrendyranked 
12th. But as Harperadmits, "No one 
is really ever happy wilb national 
polls." 

While Harper may nol be im-
pressed with his team's ranking, he 
shouldn't ignore it UCSD is cur-
rendy ranked behind WWPA rival 
Air Force. 

1be Falcons dethroned the Tri-
tons last year in the Western Water 
Polo Association Championships 
and have already downed Ibis year' s 
squad 7-5. 

But the Tritons are far from wor-
ried and are confident about captur-
ing their third crown in four years. 
They went 3-1 last weekend at the 
Nor-Cal Toumament in Berkeley, 

The UCSD Guudian 

knocking off Slippery Rock and 
Santa Clara with impressive 11-9 
and 21-2 willS respectively. 

Butthey couIdn 'tget past Fresno 
St.re, as they were unable to hold on 
10 a two-goallead with three min-
utes 10 play in lhe fourth quaner and 
fdl 8-7 in ovenime. 

"That was a tough loss," said 
Harper. "We're slill stinging from 
iL" 

Slightly daunted, UCSD came 
back impressively, smashing 20th-
.... ed UC Davis 18-5. 

Harper classifies this year's 
squad as mainly a power team, rather 
than a finesse ceam, admitting dlat 
they don't have the counter-attack-
ing speed that theircounterpans did 
jUSl two years ago. 

With Brown, Vance and 
Goodrich in frontofopposing teams' 
goals, Harper says teams will have 
no choice but to drop back and de-
fend them. 

With such shooling power in the

middle, the Tritons must be pre-
pared for pressure on the outside 
shooting game. Todate,thatissome-
thing that has not developed as 
Harper would have liked. "We need 
to work on [outside] shooting an 
awful lot" Harper said. "And we 
need to build their confidence." 
Harper assens that moving the ball 
through the offense will be a key to 
scoring success. 

Turning to the defensive end of 
the pool, the Trirons will start fresh-
I1Wl Michael Warren in goal. War-
ren, a first-team high school All· 
American, will replace last year's 
stalter, sophomore Andy Bruce. 

Yet Harper is extremely pleased 
with the situation to date. "I've got 
two young, very good goalies," he 
said. 

With young goalies, one would 
have to question UCSD's ability to 
defend in a l1Wl-down situation. 
But according to Harper, man~wn 
defense has been one of the bright 

SPORTS 19 

spolS thus far. UCSD's opponents 
have been able to convert fewer 
than 25 percent of its 6-00-5 oppor-
tunities, a statistic that Harper is 
quile pleased with. 

Harper wishes the same could be 
said for the other end of the pool 
where UCSD has,lodate,only been 
able to convert about half ofits man-
up opportunities. Withejcctionsnow 
being only 20 seconds - they were 
previously 35 - the Tritons have 
had a problem with moving the de-
fense with their 6-on-S passing 
games. At times, over-passing has 
led to UCSD scrambling to get a 
shot off. 

A main goal of this year's squad, 
says Harper, is to improve the Tri-
tons' extra-man shooting pe~nt­
age - an improvement that is sure 
to come with time. In addition, 
Harper feels the Tritons need to 
begin working on "coming through 
at crunch time." He is confident that

'The Fisher King' 
And the H~ly Grail 
Bx: Joshua Odlntz 
Staff Writer 

Once again. Robin Williams 
has used his acting skill to 
touch our hearts in the new 
Terry Gilliam movie. "The 
Fisher King." As Perry, Wil-
liams plays a man traumatized 
by the killing of his wife in a 
posh yuppie bar. Finally dis-
traught, Williams ends up on a 
crusade for the Holy Grail. 

During this period, the film 
follows the story of Jack (Jeff 
Bridges), a Howard Stem-
esque radio personality who 
falls from his mighty throne 
after a caller goes on a murder 
spree because Jack brushed him 
off. Jack winds up as a man-
ager of a video store owned by_ 
his girl friend, Anne (Mercedes 
Ruehl). He decides to end iran 

. after a heated drinking session, 

and as he face the waters be-
low, two punk assault him. 
Perry, and his merry knights 
come to the rescue of Jack, and 
Jack attempts to repay Perry by 
helping him meet Lydia 
(Amanda Plummer), a woman 
who has captured Perry's heart. 

What makes "The Fisher 
King" so enjoyable is the in~r­
action between two males who 
are trying toconquertheiremO; 
tional fears throtIJh reality and 
the farasy of Ihc: Grail and 
knight legends. DirectorTeny 
GiUiam ("Brazil," "Monty Py-
thon and Ihc: Holy Grail'') cre-
ates a New Yark tbat is auel 
and full of stone. but under this 
facade are real people with 
simple dreams. Like his other 
films, Gilliam uses obscure

Several Of the dancers told us 
that, unlike the women, they don't 
dance for the money. Some said 
they do it to keep in shape, and all of 
them said they do it because they 
love it. These dancers were proud of 
their talent. All of the men we spoke 
with had brought their mothers to 
see them perform. Onedancer,JOMY

Oassy may be a stretch, but not 
as much of a stretch as the one the 

cotton bicycle shons (which were 
two sizes too small) had to make 
over their manly appendages. Ac-
cording to Kane, Girls Nite Out 
cannot be fairly compared to Pure

in whal turns on the sexes. "Most

HIATUS H5 

The audience is constantly re-
minded of Peny's traumatic situa-
tion through the Red Night (Chri 
Howell), the evil of all man kind and 
Peny's foil. 

But that is not to say that the 
comedic elements are drowned out 
by the drama. Jack and Peny's 
experiences in Grand Central Sta-
tion and Central Park are some of 
the most humorous moments in cin-
ematic history. These dreamy se-
quences provide the basis for the 
fairy tale atmosphere thaa keeps the 
movie from being an intense drama. 

The ensemble cast recruited for 
"The Fisher King" truly shines 
through the brilliant dialogue. Nev-
enheless, the high-cnliber acting of 
Bridges ("The Fabulous Baker 
Boys'"), Williams, PI umber ("Agnes 
of God"), and Ruehl ("Married to 
the Mob") tumed a good mov ie into 
an excellent movie. When Oscar 
time roles around. look for Wil-
liams and Bridges to be on the cov-
eted list of nominations. 

The only complaint with the 
movie is the typical Hollywoodend-
ing. Even though the film is a 
fairy tale, some do end on a down 
note. Gilliam and LaGravenese opt 
for a happy and bittersweet ending. 
It works, but it leaves some of the 
audience behind becuase of (he out-
right cominess in the resolution. 

Still, ''TheFisherKing''isabright 
spot in a season where many big 
budgetmoviesarefollowingsimple 
formulas. 

The only pattem that the film 
takes is the signature of Gilliam as 
director. Nothing is ordinary in this 
movie. Like"The Grifters," "The 
Fisher King" is unpredictable. but 
wholly believable.

ALBUM R 

The title Uni~rsaJ Poel can be 
viewed as misleading for this al-
bum. It could be seen as being 
universal in the sense lhatit contains 
nothing differem than mos. other 
pop rap, or as not universal in the 
sense that the only audience this 
music can appeaI.o are M-Doc's 
dancers. 

The album cover has M-Doc 
standing on a globe, and the words 
"M-Doc, Universal PoeL" To me 
that implies he has something 10 
say, possibly something which ~ 
peals '0 the whole world - the 
whole universe maybe. No such 
luck here. All M-Doc has 10 say are 
.rite pop raps about picking up 
women, how much he has, how 
fresh his OJ is - shit that was 
played out in the 1980's. The title 
track is pointless boasting and 
sounds not unlike a bad Son of 
Bazertc song. Nothing could save 
this, not even booming bass, of 

wbicb there is none.

In case the album title doesn't 
clue you in to the spirituality of the 
songs, the opening track wi ll : "I'd 
like to welcome you to the Utopian 
Experience. Of the Heart. of the 
Soul and of the Cross. I'd like 10 ay, 
'What's up?' to God." . 

Spirtual? Indeed. and so are the 
two brothers who made this very 
spiritual album. Of the Heart ... is 
laid back. smooth and original. 
Prince Be and OJ Minutemix blend 
beautifu l vocal harmonies with exy 
rhythm and smooth rap into a style 
reminiscent of De La Soul. 

"Paper Don" is a love song with 
hypnotic harmonies and a seem-
ingly trdnce inspired vocal delivery. 
Prince Be's voice is' hypnotic C?n 
every track, but most effective in 
"Reality (Used to be a Friend of 
Mine)," "Comatose," and "In the 
Presence of Minors." 

The order of the songs is such 
that.he beginning and ending tracks 
have the smoothest feel, and the 
middle songs are a bit mo~ amped. 

At his hardest, Prince Be sounds 
not unlike u.. CooI1, and when he's 
chill, he owns his own distinctive 
sound. OJ Minutemix rarely, 
scraIChes but sliD supplies P.M.
