ProIIe: UCSD's Chalmers Johnson, who has been 
called both a prophet and a pundit, explains why he 
thinks America is losing an economic battle with Japan 

Before the Los Angell'S Tillie s writes 
,111 article about Japan, it calls UCSO 
Professor Chalmers John.~n . When 
PBS's Fm/lflill(' produced a special pro-
granl on Japan 's trJde practices. they 
interviewed Johnson. Even Bill 
Clinton' economic advisors have con-
tacted him for advice. He i alternately 
cbcribed as one of the world's leading 
lICholars on Japanese politics. economy 
and society and as an academic pundit 
and one of the world' s leading "Japan-
bushers." 

And after three and a half decades as 
a profes.sorat the University of Cal ifor-

nia.Johnson will retire at the end of this 
year. He leaves behind him an enduring 
cooO'Oversy over America'. proper re-
sponse to the phenomenal rise of Japan 
in the post-World War II era. a contro-
versy heJieclly debated beyond the con-
fines of academia. and extending to the 
Oval Office and the halls of Congres.~. 

Johnsoo hasneverbeen onetomince 
words when discussing relations be-
tween the United States and Japan. 

"Trade is supposed to be mutually 
advantageous. From an American point 
of view, it is not particularly advanta-
geous to us anymore. It has driven a I~

of people out of wOlt. It cau.'iCd things 
like the Los Angeles riot.~ in April when 
people without work ri~ed. And one of 
the reasoos they' re without work is that 
the los Angeles industrial m'\C ha.~ 
been hollowed out:' he says. 

John!iOf'l feels America's probIem~ 
srern from it~ unresponsive policies to-
ward Japan. "If s not Japan' s fault. It is 
our pol icies that have encoumged and 
allowed Japan to do this. The Japanese. 
like most ~her people around the world. 
think we ore crazy. Since we behave in 
a crJZY manner. it is 1101 up to Japan to 
cOlTeCt it for Il'. Ifs up 10 u., to C0lre(.1 
our.;elves. •• 

A professor at UCSO's Gr.xluate 
School of Intemarional Rel:llions and 
Pacific Studio; (IRIPS) since 19!\R. 
Johnson and hi~ theories have ra:eived 

a gre<lt deal of attention on both sides of 
the Pacitic. Before COOling to UCSD. 
John'iOlltaught at UC Berkeley, where 
from I %7 to 1972 he wa.~ chair of the 
center for Oline;e srudies. Widely rec-

talism is far more effective than th:u of 
the U.S.

sible for laying the foundations of "rev i-

rea.'iOI1. he ha.~ been dubbed the "godfa-
ther of revisiooism:' a title he wel-
comes. While revisiooism is gaining 
acceptance with ;\ growing number of 
expert'\. criticsst ill charge that Johnsoo's 
views are merely Japan-bashing. 

"We bel ieve that the old policy i. 
mistaken and is leading toward dL<;aster 
and that the people who are attacking 
me and ~hersasrevisiooists. oras inthe 
case of [UCSO Professor Masaol

accusing me of being a racist - lhat 
these are people who reflect vested in-
terests and who basically don't wanl 
Americans thinking about Jap.1Il with-
out the prior approval of the Japanese." 
says Johnson. 

Miyoshi. a literature professor and 
the ch;lir of UCSO's Japanese Sludies 
progmm. is one of Johnson' s harshest 
critics. The two have publicly buned

the United States to want to know about 
Japan. It i the merest prudence:' he 
says. 

Furthennore. Johnson charges that 
Illany critics of revisionism are acting 
out of financial self-interest. "Japan dis-
poses of a gre:u deal of money these 
days and universities are money-ab-
sorbers. A lot of thelll ,u-e abwrbing 
Illoney from Japan:' "IYS John.'iOI1. nOl-

cans pul strings on it. Geisha know how 
10 behave. If you're a paid prostitute. 
you know how to ingratiate yourself to 
the people paying. 

"Every Japanese knows th:u to do 
business here, it costs money. and that 
the Americans arc: buyable." he says. 

Becau.~ of this. Johnson believes. 
Americans must rethink their policy 
toward Japan. According to Johnson. 
the current policy is based on a belief 
that the two countries are essentially 
similar capitalist ~ieties. Based on 
this outlook. U.S.-Japan diplom:lcy 
should be limited to ensuring that rela-
tions between the twO countries remain 
smooth and free of disagreement over 
econonlics. John.;on claims that thi, 
premise of similarity is totally un-
founded.

the U.S. by seven years of occupation. 

ERRATA 
In the article entitled "Rushed Friendships,· some quotes were attributed 

incorrectly. The quotes, "There's no degrading stuff. I did some things that 
might be considered degradi~ But they were on my own will: and "!just did 
it for the parties, the chicks, whateYerit maybe, and evetyonce in a while the 
brothertlood that just happened to go with it," should have been attributed to 
Pi Kappa Phi member Scott Johnson. Delta Tau Delta member Art Johnson 
was incorrectly identified as a member of Pi Kappa Phi. Also, the article should 
have stated that most rushees are invited to join at least one of the 
organizations they rush. Personal incompatibilities, and not limited space, are 
the usual reason for a rushee being denied a bid. The Guardian regrets the 
errors.

''Our problem is IlOl neces.~ly 10 
copy lhe Japanese. It is 10 match the 
Japanese. [n lhe same w.ly that in the 
Cold War. we did 001 copy the USSR. 
we matched the USSR:' Johnson said. 
For Ih.1t reason, he bel ieves I hat the 
United Slal~ needs toalter ir.o; industrial 
policy. 

"When [Head of the President 's 
Counci I OfEcOllOll1ic Advisors) Michael 
Boskin says. ·It <Ioe:-n' t make any dif· 
ference whetherwe manufacture poIato 
chips or computer chips. They all jib! 
contribute to the GNP.' By the way. 
there 's notanolher government on earth 
Ihat believe'\ that.. . certainly not the 
Japanese govemmenl." says Johnson. 

Though Miyoshi readily acknowl-
edges that there is some credence to 
what lohnson has to say. he argues tMt 
generJlizations like "Japan" and "the 
United Stales" are misleading. Ncx all 
Americans are suffering together. 
Miyoshi points out. and we are not as 
unified as lhe revisionists claim. 

"Chalmers did write a good book 
about MlTI," allows Miyoshi. "but he's 
been:o..1ying thesamethingfor lOyears." 

To Johnson, U.S. relalions with Ja-
pan and also with Germany are a big 
pan of the 1992 presidenti:1I canlpaign. 
Both countries are now world leaders, 
and America needs to respond, Johnson 
argues. 

The candid:ltes are addres.o;i ng the 
issue, according to Johnson, but he 
doesn't bel ieve any of them are address-

ing it suffICiently. However. he suppons 
BiU Clinlon for preside~ 

"It seems 10 me that there is no 
question that George Bush has over-
whelmingly shown that he deserves !l()( 
to ben:-elected. Whether Mr. Clinton or 
Mr. Pe!tt could govern is an open ques-
tion. At the sarne time. I think a loe of us 
are hopeful that a Clinton administra· 
lion will mean a renewal of an activist 
government to begin to solve some of

Americans 
are buyable." 

the palpable problems of our society," 
says John'iOfl. adding thaI he has been 
cont:ICted by some of Clinton's advi-
sors. 

But Johnson doesn't believe that the 
problems in our altitude toward Japan 
rest solely with the government. He 
feels tMt universilies have been slow to 
adapt to the growing need for more 
infonnation about lapan. calling the 

The UCSD Gllur.liull 

CUJTel1l stIlUS of J~ studies a "di-
saster in American universities." 

'The problem of leaching about Ja-
pan isa microcosrnofthe generJl Ameri-
can problem of coming to ~,"ps with 
Japan," said Johnson. 'We 're in de-
cline. We know it, but don't want to 
admil it. And we're Mving enonllou.~ 
diffICulties coming to grips with this 
challenge and above all with the fact that 
it's IlOl going to be a quick fix : ' 

According to Johnson, Americans 
need tOSlart taking Japan as seriously a~ 
they take the United Stales. The Japa, 
nese, he suggests. probably know more 
about San Di.!go County than the people 
who live then:. 

Johnson also argue.~ that agencies 
which deal with Japan need to employ 
people who speak and undeMand Ihe 
language. 

Yet. in spite ohhe criticism Johnson 
has received. he believes that revision-
ism is becoming Ies.~ controver..ial and 
more of a standard viewpoint. It is a 
development that makes him feel ';(}me-
what vindicated. 

"In the 1950;. I wrote a book ba.~i­
cally arguing for the authenticity of the

co-op: Dispute 
over proposal changes 
stalls agreement 
ContInued from paCe 1 
ming and Facil ities Tom Tuckerrockcd 
the A.S. in it~ struggle to otiain inde-
pendenllegal counsel. "1 also agm:d 
and was an advOC31e and I tIlkcd wim 
Mike IHoimesl about it." said Tucker. 
"It W'oL'i logical and made sel1!le and wa.s 
needed ar !he time." 

Watson emphasiud that Ihis excep-
tion was made solely for the purpose of 
assisting me A.S. in negoriaIing the terms 
of irs agreement 10 assume over.;igtll reo 
sponsibility and liability for me co-ops. 

After the negotiations are over. the 
AS. will no longer be able to retain 
independent legal couno;el ;I(.'cording to 
Watson and Holmes. 

According to Holmes. on the advice 
of their lawyers the A.S. is halting all 
negotiations concerning the co-ops un· 
til a new AS. SIaIUS is established. "We 
will be negotiating for a SIaIUS change 
- to become more of our own associa· 
tion and to have more autonomy within 
the university." he said. 

Steve Oubb. Graduate Studelll As-
sociation (GSA) and Groundwork 
Books Co-op member, said that al-
though the AS.' new legal counsel is a 
"posit ive deve lopment." there i.~ "much 
more that needs to be done:' 

Dubb maintained that the only way 
the negotiwions can truly be student 
negotiations is if the A.S. is given com-
plete control of its checking account'>. 
The fact that the AS. was allowed to 
retain independent counsel is a "small

He added that the news.'itand he 
frequents. like most other newsstands in 
Los Angeles. has an adult section. 

"I said yesterday when these two 
charges were made that it was despera-
tion politics." said Herschensohn. ··It i 
much. much. much wor.;e than thai. It 
is trash. it's slime. it's sleaze, it'ssrneaf-
ing and it is selective spying. 

"Barlxlra Boxerto me represents the 
wor t of po litical li fe." he said. 
Herschensohn insisted that Boxer was 
behind the new allegations. not a "lone 
mnger." as !he Boxer suff claims. 

step in thaa din:ction." Dubb said. 
Meanwhile. !he c!KIpS have ex-

pressed anger that !he wrinen proposal 
drawn up by Univen;ity General Coun-
sel Joanna Beam wa~ different from the 
proposal discussed by the co-ops. the 
A.S. and the universiry on Oct. 23. 

On Oct. 26. Beam ~ a letter to the 
co-ops' ~omey. Lott~Cohen. which 
included a "revised draft" of !he A.S. · 
co-op amngetl'leR. Beam wrote thai 
the draft "incorporates the comments 
which ~ discussed" at the Oct. 23 
meeting. 

However. Dubb claimed thai the 
dr.tft is the university's own proposal. 

"It is unethical to change !he pr0-
posal and present it a.~ our agreement." 
said Dubb. 

Dubb said that.amongotherchanges 
made in the agreement. the sub-space 
lease agreement wasessentially reduced 
from five years to one year. and the due 
date for the annual reports on co-op 
operaIions Wa! changed from Novem· 
ber to October. 

Funhermore. the period allowed for 
use of the North Conference room by 
the General Store Co-op to sell text-
books was left '10 be spocif..t" and that 
rent wou Id be charged despite prev iOlL~ 
agreements. 

"'They threw a real monkey wrench 
into the woOO:' said Dubb. '1'his is no 
slight misunderllt..1nding." 

However. Holmes contends that the 
co-ops sent an altered draft of the a~'Tee' 
mentas well. 

He said that when the Oct. 23 meet-
ing ended. OOIh sides left without a 
commitment. 

Holmes explained mat negociations 

Herschensohn shifted his remarks. 
describing Boxer's refusal to meet and 
debate wim him in a public forum a.~ 
cowardly. 

After the conference. a reporterfrorn 
the Los AII~des Times approached 
Herschensohn and asked him about 
comments made by the owner of the 
newsstand where heallegedly purcha'ied 
pornographic magazines. 

Herschensohn responded that such 
allegations were not true, but hedid not 
deny ever having bought a Playboy. 

Herschensohn is a proponent of the 
Republican party "family values" plat-
form. 

In the ocher senate race. Peace and 
Freedom P'.uty senaIe candidate Gerald 
Home, speaking Saturday in a tele-
phone interv iew from his room at the La 
Jolla Residence Inn. said that his cam-
paign activities in San Diego had fo-

often involve i'oe!1ding interpretalions of 
a proposal rock and fonh until lhere L~ 
an agreement. "There's a lot of faxing 
going on." he said. 

Holmes empha.~ized that the pr0b-
lem was mainly one of communication 
; clearer definitions are needed in order 
for the wrinen flIllIXNIl to work. 

Thc:Ot1.J I evictiondeadlineJXL"..ed 
uneventfully. Oubb said that the admin· 

i~Jlion indicated thai no police action 
would be taken to evict the co-ops. 

InSlead. either an unlawful detainer. 
an action t1ken by the Stale couns. or a 
grievance. which is an inten131 proctdu~. 
will be used for the eviction process. 

Last Friday. the co-ops ~t1I (he uni· 
ver..ity a letter a_king for a 3O-day ex-
tension oflhe evictiond:ue because they

In return. tl1eco-opswould delay the 
griev;mce procedures again..;t the ad-

in by 30 days. 

"We'd operate better without the 
evK.1ion hanging over our heads," said 
Oubb. "ThLs would give us a 3O-day 
period to II)' to work things out." 

As yet there has been no response 
from the adminL<;traIion. 

Dubb said thai the eviction proce-
dure would take at Iea.st four months to 
complete. 

However. he expressed concern that 
the co-ops might soon be "spent out of 
existence" because the university can 
afford the sky-high legal fees. 

"We need a lot of suppOlt." said 
Dubb. "Besides the money. we need 
students to help out and write lette~ to

Home is running against Feinstein 
and Republ ican incumbent Jo hn 
Seymour for California's shon-ternl

Home said his party and ideals had 
been "sandbagged" by the government 
and the press as a result of the "red· 
baiting" during the Cold W;U'.

Enough sports_ you declare. What 's

Ross Perot. Hmm. Name rings a bell 
some where. I think I read about h im in 
the business section many years ago. 

And who is this guy B ill Ointon? 

In a frustrating season of both men-
tal and physical ups and downs. it's 
anybody's guess as to how well the 
Tritons can do in the post-season, if they 
make it that far. 

Never heard of him. Says here he had an 
alleged affair with some girl named

MONDAY. NOVEMBER 2. 1992 Special Electioll Sectioll PAGEDI 

The 1992 campaign has been long, arduous and painful for voters and candi-
dates alike. Tomorrow, it will all mercifully come to an end. Who is best quali-
fied to change the face of America? With a line-up of uninspiring candidates to 
chose from, it's hard to predict a winner. As usual, however, the loser in 
tomorrow's election will likely be'the American people. See Page 04 " 05

The right to die with dignity cannot be 
overshadowed by questions of legality.

The Year of the

U.S. politics have been dominated by males 
since day one. Will 1992 truly be the Year 
of the Woman, or is this just more meaning-
less rhetoric being flung about by campaign 
strategists? See Page 02.

COMMENTARY: Confining women to a 
single election year is absolutely ludicrous 
By Wendy McNeill 
Staff Writer 

The Year 0 the 
The so-<:alled "Year of the Woman." a hyped media tenn de\Cribing the 

Mlrge of women into politics. has offended or irritated people all over the 
political 'pectrum. Some conservatives con,ider it ~bot :tge by the PC 
movement. while even the moderately left insiM that the tenn i, trite and 
demean ing. 

One of the most profound commentaries on the Year of the Woman 
w:t~ voiced by a member of the Women\ Re:.ource Center who ~id. " It \ 
n t the Year of Women. [t'~ the Year of the Wealthy White Woman who 
can afford to run for offi ce." 

Though many women are de lighted to !oCe BarbarJ Bo,er and Dianne 
Fein~tein in prominent position~ on the Democratic ticket. reducing the 
phenomenon to a ~ingle year event i~ :Ib:.olutely ludicrou,. Doe, thi, "Year 
of the Woman" mean that our current situation is an aberration that will

Continued from .,.,e 2 
five years ago. 

But in any a!oe. it would be even 
more ;,igniticant than Ross Perot' s 
relative ~uccess as an independent 
candidate to see a woman end rsed 
by a major pany presidentiallicket. [n 
addition. "The Year of the Woman" 
might even be a legitimate title if a

SENATE: 'The 
Year of the Woman" 
is a cheap political 
ploy by the Oems 
Continued from page 2 
Senate ,eats held by "vulnerable" 
Democr.lls. Most of the so-called 
women', group~ ,ided with Ihe in-
cumbents even Ihough three of the 
five candidate~ were pro-choice. 

Both Senators Bill Bradley (D-
New Jersey) and Paul Simon (D-IIIi-
nois) lament the fact that there are few 
women in the Senate. I f so. why did 
they not VOluntarily slep down when 
challenged by Republican women in 
I 990'! 

The an~wer is 'imple. Just as 
"mainstream" black groups di. own 
conservalive blacks such :IS Clarence 
Thomas. Thomas Sowell or Gary 
FrJnks (R-Connecticut). so do the so-
called women's groups disavow Re-
publican women and. more so. con-
se rvative women, 

The largest women's group in the 
country is 11(11 the radical National 
Organizalion for Women ( OW). but 
Concerned Women for America 
(CW A). a conservative-leaning group. 
But how often is the CWA consulted 
on so-called "women's issues"? And 
the nonsensical rhetoric that the pro-
life movement is ruled by "rich white 
men who will never get pregnant" 
completely ignores the fact that 
women hold the leadership positions 
in all major pro-life organizations. 
except the Catholic Church. 

TI,e Democrats comend thnt Re-
publicans wi ll destroy women ·srighl~. 
Based on one issue, the GOP pro-life 
plank. they argue that all women 's 
rights are in danger. never once e)(-
plaining how opposition to abortion 
produces pay inequities or the so-
called "glass ceiling" that prevents 
women from reaching high-level 
management positions. 

According to Kay Bailey 
Hutchinson. Texas state treasurer and 
chair of lhe Houston convention on 
its first night. President-Bush tilled 40 

stati tically outnumbered in politics 
for social and historical reasons. 
Achieving a gender balance in the 
power structure of our country is nOC 
going to take place without seriou. 
change in our social systems. 

Then again. perhaps 1V0men 
should be grateful thm they ha ve 
gained the ~pot light for at le~t this 
year. Perhaps last year was the lucky 
year for the Sporred Owl. and next 
year will be lhe hailed Year of the 
Redwood. 

Provided Clinton wins the elec-
tion. we might even be so fOr1unate to 
see "Four Years of the Environment" 
ora miraculous "PresidentiaITeml of 
Education ." The~e emphases. of 
course. will be temlinated a, a differ-
ent presidential candidate enters the 

percent of all top government ap-
poi ntments with women. While th i!> 
cen:linly is not 51 percent . ,ollsider-
ing the field of qualified candidate,. 
Ihis i3 probably cio,e to fair wi thou t 
obviously being a quota. 

And lest the meaning of th .. t last 
sentence be tw isted. it i~ n I intended

Ralher. becau~ of the previousexi~t ­
ence of "gl:1;'s cei lings," the lield of

stans in the House. Until there is 
bener representation in the House. 
Ihere will probably be even less bal-
ance in the Senate. In the meantime, 
we should not SIan electing people to 
the Senate just because "they have

A prime example is our own Sen-
ate race for the long-tenn seat, for-
merly held by thaI greal pillar of eth-
ics. Alan Cranston. Until recently. 
Califomians appeared poised to re-
turn 10 more of the same. 

Because women have received the

To compound the irony. we are 

still facing a situation with fi ve con-
servative SupremeCounjustices who 
could strip women of reproductive 
freedom. 

The majority of members .11 the 
Women's Resource Cenler were an-
gered and ~kepl ical of the entire ~i tu ­
'Il ion. 

Though they were hesitant to fonn 
:1 consensus of Iheir opinions to :IC-

She bounced 143 bad checks, tOlaling 
around $41.000. She opened hercam-

rate: since then. ,he ha, ,lipped from 
worst to fourth worst in attend'lI1ce. 
Shcalso voted fort he much maligned 
1990 congressional pay raise. 

According to the National Tax-
payc:rs' Union, Boxer has the largest 
spending record in all of Congre,s. 
TIl is may be a change from Cr:II1;.ton ·, 
record, but it b a change in the wrong 
direction. 

Boxer pu ' hed for public disclo-
sure of our sec reI weapons programs. 
then later voted against releasing the 
names of the top24 check kiters. Il's 
okay to compromise national secu-
rity. but not to expose legislative im-
propriety. She initially supponed a 
high ta)( surcharge on Medic:lre and 
only backed down after a tremendous 
outcry from ,eniorcitizens' groups. 

By contrast. Herschensohn would 
repeal the 1990 pay hikes. cut spend-
ing. push for tax reform . suppon free 
trade and resuscitate the Califomia 
economy by preserving defense con-
tracts. 

Herschensohn h~ been endorsed 
by both the Howard Jarvis and Paul

Monday, November 2,1992 

It seems only fining 
that the people running for 
the highest office in the 
land should be a vil1ual 
parade of the lame and 
unqualified. More than 

any other election in recent memory. the 1992 
presidential campaign is enough to make one realize 
how far we've fallen. 

'The incumbent. George Bus h. has clearly 
demonstrated that he is unfit for the office. In the 
past four years. the economy has become mired in a 
sinKhole. unemployment is up, industry has fallen 
behind Germany and Japan and ou r military remains 
rooted in a Cold War mindset. And George Bush'~ 
response to every issue facing the nation has been 
the same - avoid doing anything for as long as 
possible . Bush failed to acknowledge that the 
economy was in a recession until long after that fact 
was abundantly clear to even the most ~tarry-eyed 
optimists. The president based most of his policie, 
on the incompetent advice of John Sununu. Nicho-
las Brady, Richard Darman and Michael Boskin. 

Only when he Will> trailing Bill Clinton by double 
digits did Bush offer any programs or vision. But 
this last-second posturing can't hide the obviou~ 
truth about George Bush - he's a do-nothing 
president. A second four-year tenn will be exactly 
like the first . And that would spell disaster for the 
nation. 

'The ideas put forth by independent H. Ross Perot 
clearly recognize the problems facing the nation and 
make some attempt to correct them. Perot's 
candidacy has been an intriguing one. and he no 
doubt appeals to the many people yearning for 
change. 1be other candidates could do a lot worse 
than adopting Perot's pragmatic approach to 
handling the economy. 

Yet. there is no way in the world we could 
endorse Perot for president. First. his motivations 
for running are clearly suspect. One does not enter, 
drop out and re-enter the presidential race on a 
whim. which Perot has c1earty done. And why 
would Perot spend millions of dollars of his own 
money to campaign for a job he claims he doesn ' t 
even want? 'There is some sort of hidden agenda 
going on here. and the thought of putting Ross Perot 
in the White House is unsettling at best. Further-
more, his unsubstantiated claims on "60 Minutes" of 
a Republican plot to smear him indicate that Perot's 
grasp on reality is tenuous. 

We wish we could be as enthusiastic about Bill 
Ointon as members of the UCSD Democratic 
Victory Coalition purport to be. But not even a 
tenninal bout with youthful idealism can mask 
Ointon's obvious shortcomings. What he stands for 
seems to vary with what he thinks voters want to 
hear. This is particularly obvious in Clinton's 
statements about his draft status. 

Whether or not Clinton dodged the draft 2.5 yea~ 
ago is of little imponance. The problem is that 
Qinton clearly has been evaisve when discussing 
his past behavior. As a candidate and a man, he is 
less than straighrforward, and that is a dangerous 
quality in a president. However. Ronald Reagan and 
George Bush have already proven that honesty is an 
unnecessary quality for a president. 

Despite his campaign gymnastics. Clinton is no 
moderate. That middle-class tax relief plan that he 
keeps heralding is destined to be conveniently 
forgotten by the time inaugur.uion rolls around. And 
to believe that a Ointon administration will be 
content to merely "soak the rich" (as if the "rich" 
has ever been clearly defined by Clinton), is to be 
unforgiveably na·ive. Ointon will increase taxes. As 
it stands. the Clinton plan is a perilous fomy for 
Americans to take. 

Yet, in spite of these undeniable Haws. we 
endorse Bill Clinton for president. Will Clinton 
instantly heal the nation of all that ails it? Probably 
not. But the same could be said of the other candi-
dates. and of all the names on the ballot , Clinton 
probably has the best chance for making some 
headway. And Clinton's running mate, AI Gore, has 
a finn grasp on environmental issues and is cel1ainly 
more grounded in reality than Dan Quayle. 

Clinton offers particularly good blueprints on the 
issues of national health care and economic reform. 
His record on education in Arkansas and his plan to 
rebuild the nations schools put Clinton well ahead of 
the other candidates. Arkansas may not be an 
educational mecca. but the improvements under the 
Ointon administration have been remarkable. 
Arkansas high school seniors that went on to attend 
college rose from 38.2 percent in 1982 to 51.3 
percent in 1991. He fought for. and won. state-wide 
teacher testing to weed out completely ineffectual 
teachers. no small potatoes when the teacher's union 
is fighting the program tooth and nail. 

C1inton's proposals to bring the nation's higher 
education system within the reach of more students 
is also worthy of praise. His program calls for 
guaranteed loans to college students who pledge to 
go to work in the community as teachers. police 
officers or other service positions for two years if 
they cannot repay the money. 

We have no illusions about a Clinton presidency. 
and neither should anyone else. It is cenainly 
possible that Clinton will wind up as Carte,. 1/: the 
Sequel. But his campaign offers a modicum of hope. 
and at this point. that's good enough. 

'The Guardian endorses Bill Clinton for presi-
dent, not because we feel he has Hawless vision and 
a solid plarform. Instead, we endorse Bill Clinton 
because he is the best choice of a feeble lot. And 
right now, he's exactly what the American voter 
deserves. 

GrapnlCS rTf Roger Kuo Guardian 

Throughout the 1992 election, a number of questions have been hanging over our heads. What does the future of 
America hold? Will the economy ever get back on track? How should we reassess foreign policy now that the Cold War is 
over? But one nagging question keeps coming up every time the candidates posture and politic. When looking at the 
multitude of candidates running for office, the same question rears its ugly head - what have we done to deserve this? 

At times, it appeared as if someone placed a bizarre voodoo curse on America, damning us to an eternity of ineffectual 
candidates. Of the dwindling number of politicians with the intelligence and integrity to lead this nation, most had enough 
sense to stay out of the fray. And the few qualified candidates who dared to throw their hats into the ring were promptly 
dismissed in the primaries by the voters. 

What we're left with then is a collection of assorted hacks, boobs, opportunists and would-be felons trying to hold 
positions of power over the rest of us. It's hard not to be cynical about a long, drawn-out electoral process that continually 
spews out the same old nonsense. At least in 1992, more people are beginning to question the process and look for alterna-
tives to the meager choices offered by the two-party system. However, the fact remains the same - come tomorrow, an 
overwhelming majority of the electorate will still be voting for business as usual. 

We can put the blame on a lot of people for the rapid decline of American politics. Lobbyists and Political Action Com-
mittees (PACs) fling money around Capitol Hill with reckless abandon. And politicians are only too willing to exchange 
influence for money, leaping through hoops like trained poodles at the circus. Candidates rarely, if ever, address issues, 
and instead place their emphasis on relentless, irrelevant character attacks. Even the media is guilD' of wOIl)'ing more 
about draft records and marital fidelity than about which candidate is truly qualified to hold office. 

But while all this fmger pointing is going on, ultimately the blame must rest with the voters. We settle for unacceptable 
choices, content to vote for "the lesser of two evils" when instead we should be saying "none of the above." We vil1ual\y 
ignore candidates outside of the mainstream, unless they happen to be crazed billionaire presidential candidates. So the 
answer to the question "What have we done to deserve this?" is simply, "Everything." We have no one to blame but 
ourselves. 

Perhaps Winston Churchill was right when he said, "The best thing about democracy is that people get what they de-
serve." In 1992, we're getting it in spades,

Long Term Seat 
'The six-year U.S. 

Senate seat has become a 
banleground for conser-
vative and liberal 
ideologies. It features two 
"outsider" candidates 

running on a plarform of "change:' And more than 
any other race on the ballot this year. it offers a 
distinct choice for voters. 

Barbara Boxer. the Democratic candidate and 
congresswoman. has been basing her campaign on 
the " Year of the Woman" rallying cry. The Senate, 
Boxer claims. has virtually no representation of 
women (only two out of 100 senators are women). 
and that she is just the woman to change all that. 
Boxe r's right about one thing. There are not enough 
women holding elected positions. panicularly in the 
Senate. and there should be a greater number of 
women senators. However. she is clearly unfit to be 
one oflhem. 

To elect Barbara Boxer to the Senate would be an 
embarrassment for California. Boxer is a notorious 
big spender in Congress. throwing good money after 
bad at every given opportunity. This is just the sort 
of person we don't need in the Senate during times 
of fiscal crisis. 

Funhermore. Boxer bounced 143 checks. one of 
the highest totals in the House of Representat ives. 
She has one of the highest absentee rates. she take~ 
advantage of congressional perks and she repeatedly 
voted for congressional pay raises. In short. Boxer 
has an illustrious career of acting out of vested self-
interest. Her strong record on the environment aside. 
Boxer is not the type of politician who deserves a 
promotion to the Senate. 

Bruce Herschensohn has gotten a lot of negative 
press. and hi~ views on the military. the environment 
and abonion are not in line with the majority of 
Californians. Like mo~t candidates. he is not wi thout 
Haws. 

But more so than Boxer. Hen.chensohn is an 
outsider who opposes the perks and pork barrel of 
Congress. Herschen~ohn will fight to reduce 
government waste and decrease the size of the 
fedeml government. In an age where a growing 
bureaucmcy is draining this country of its resources. 
that is a defini te improvement. 

Many opponents of Herschensohn argue that he 
will vote to ~ink money into the defense budget and 
into needless projects like the stmtegic defen~ive 
initiative. First of all. this has hardl y been the 
centeIPiece of I-Ierschensohn' s campaign. More 
imponantly. the other ~enators would simply never 
allow it. He~chen~hn\ much ballyhooed "danger-
ous" ideas will probably never see the light of day in 
Wa"hington. 

TIle Senate mce come~ down to which t:andidate 
better undeNands the need for reform. Barbam 
Boxer. a pan of the system. clearly doe~ not. Bruce 

Herschen~ohn. an outsider. clearly does. rhe 
GlIarclic/II endorses Herschensohn for the U.S. 
Senate. 

u.s. Senate -
Short Tenn Seat 

As compared to the 
other mce for Senate . the 
two-year tenn offers very 
little choice. Essentially. 
the Republicans and 
Democr.lts are offering 

two candidates who are exactly the same. Both 

Democrat Dianne Feinstein. and RepUblican John 
Seymour are moderates with basically the same 
views on the issues of the day. And for that reason. 
both are entirely unacceptable. 

As mayor of San Francisco. Feinstein ran up a 
huge deficit and then bolted town. The city is still 
reeling from the huge spending and the increased 
numbers of homeless from the Feinstein years. 

Her run for govemor two years ago only reem-
phasized Feinstein's trouble with money - a law~uit 
was filed against her by the state election commis-
sion for failing to repon millions of dollars in 
campaign contributions. Feinstein' s financial 
dealings over the years have bordered on the near-
felonous. 

Feinstein. like Boxer. has seized the " Year of the 
Woman" mantle. but unlike Boxer. with entirely no 
justification. Feinstein's commitment to women's 
issue, varies on the degree to which it will help her 
get elected. 

But John Seymour is no better. Appointed by Pete 
Wilson to fill W ilson's ~at after the 1990 gubemato-
rial election. Seymour has proven in every way that 
he is Wibon Light - everything you e)l.pected in 
Pete Wilson and less. 

After wi tnessing what California has gone 
through in the past twO years. electing a ~pineless 
disciple of Wilson to the Senate is a di~trous 
proposition. Seymour's two-year tenure in the Senate 
has been less than remarkable. 

Even the fringe candidates from the Libenarian. 
Peace and Freedom. and American Independent 
partie~ have failed to capture the imagination. a 
depressing thought when the mainstream candidates 
are so thoroughly underwhelming. Sadly, none of the 
candidates has anything to offer to the voters of this

u.s. Congress 
- 49th Dlstilct 

'The IWO contenders 
here are Democrat Lynn 
Schenk and Republ ican 
Judy Jarvis, two pro-
choice women. Schenk is ~ currently a member of 

the pon commission and was a cabi net member for 
fomler Governor Jerry Brown. J arvi~. a nurse and 
businesswoman. has no previous political experience 
and was able to win the June primary campaigning 
ill> an "oul~ider" candid3le. 

It's very fa .. hionable to be an outsider nowadays. 
and Jarvi s is dedicated 10 change. Yet. her lack of 
political eAperience is mildly daunting. A matter of 
ewn greater concern is her flip-flops on many is!>ues. 
including fanlil) leave and ~chool vouchers. Jarvis 
does not really have a strong record of sticking to her 
guns. possibly because ... he is IIOt even sure what ,he 
believes herself. 

Schenk. on the other hand. has not altered her 
views at all. She favors a waiting period for handgun 
purchases. opposes the ~hool -voucher system and 
would have voted to override the veto on the family 
leave bill. While her political past may be a down-
side to some. panicularly her involvement in 
Brown's cabinet. Schenk is not the typical political 
insider. She established the first wome n-owned bank 
in the state and successfully fhallenged a men-only 
rule at a downtown restaurJ.n!. Unlike other candi-
dates. Schenk does not merely pay lip-service to the 
idea of change.

tends to get overlooked by 
voters . particularly when 
more high-profile national 
contests are taking place. 
But this year more than 

ever: the state assembly races are of imponance. 
panicularly to college student,. Members of the Mate 
assembly and senate will be in the best position to 
look after the interests of the University of Califor-
nia. We need to elect legislators who will not gut the 
higher education budget in pursuit of a shon-tenn 
economic windfall. 

For that reason. we support the incumbent. 
Democrat Dede Alpert . For the past two years. 
Alpert ha~ proven her dedication to protecting the 
UC system. a matter of panicular importance 
especially with a major unive~ity located inside her 

, home di~trjct. Alpert voted against the cuts in the

suppon him.

State Senate - 39th Dlatald 
Many people have 

called for a change in the 
American political 
system. Clearly. the two-
party monopoly on 
politics benefits no one. 
Choices are limited. and 
debate is stifled when 
people are forced to 

choose betweenlwo candidates who. more often 
than not. are more similar than different. It il> thb 
need for change that leads us to endorse John P. 
Moody. the Libertarian candidate. 

Jim Ellis. the Republ ican challenger. and Lucy 
Killea. the Democratic-turned-i ndependent incum-
bent. are well-qua lified candidates. However. a vote 
for either Moody or Patricia Cofre of the Peace and 
Freedom Pany would ~nd u message Ihat the days 
of two-pany politics are over. 

We support Moody for the reason that we agree 
with a basic tenet of the Libet'arian pany - the role 
of the government must be reduced. And while we 
find some of the Libenarian position to be extreme;:. 
we admire their dedication to Ihe ),upport of indi-
vidual libeny. 

We endorse John P. Moody for state senate. 

Mayor-
s..Dlago 

The two candidates 
for this office are Peter 
Navarro. an economics 
professor at UC Irvine. 
and Susan Golding. a 
member of the San Diego 

upervil>ors. In a competitive . 
campaign. neither candidate has distinguished 
himself or herself from the other. In fact. the 

relentles~ negative campaigning of both would-be 
mayors ha\ probably indicated that neither is fit for 
the office. 

Navarro. the chainnan of PLAN! (Prevent Lo~ 
Angele5ization Now!) has run Oil a controlled 
growth platform while Golding claims to be tougher 
on crime. 

rn a campaign full of mud-slinging. we feel that 
both candidates have demon!>trated that nei ther one 
is fit to be mayor. 

The Guw"dian offers no endorsement for mayor.

you to the US economy and to economics. We'lI treal a variety of topics 
chosen for topical interest. Here's a sample: 
The STOCK MARKET. What makes it go? Can you make money there? 
Why? How? Is it Vegas wearing a necktie? 
Your EDUCATION-is it an investment? What kind of payoff does it 
provide? 
INCOME and WEALTH-Who has it? Why? 
Is JAPAN performing a leveraged buyout on the USA? Better Yokohama

THE GREAT AMERICAN SOAP OPERA

By Canwon nmna

Havingbeen subjectedtothemud-

There are many 
things about the current

ENGLAND: 
The great spectacle of 
American campaigns 
merely showcases a 
lack of real substance 
Continued from page 6 

PROP 161 IS A BATILE OF MORALITY, NOT LEGALITY 
~:The landmark measure on tomorrow' ballot represents a life and death snuggle for human lights 

becau~ they become unmarketable. 
America is a "sell" culture and what 
1><:lIs. goes. 

Selling image or personalilY is far 
easier than trying to prom Ole a candi-
date on the basis of complex and 
crucial i~sues. Atlea~t Ross Perot ha~ 
tried to do this with regard to the 
economy. despite lacking substance 
on ~o many other issues. 

Therefore. I can see an overwhelm-
ing C;I...e for equal ;tnd limited media 
air-time. a., is the c;lse in Brit;lin. to 
restore some s;tnity to the electoral 
process. 

And if I was in any position to do 
so. I would ;llso recommend ;1 return 
to a more British-~tyle pmly-b;L~ed 
campaign. Fundamentally. I tbrthat 
in America. good potential presidents 
lose Ollt to good candidates who make 
poor presidents. 

Reagan W(IS the ideal candidate a~ 
no one could pin any dirt on him. but 
he was nOi exactly a "great" presi-
dent. 

Any system should be measured 
by i tsend~ . ln a nation of 250m ill ion. 
there should be no 0Ppollunity for 
anything less than first-r.lle presidelll~ . 

I doubt your founding fathers 
would have been impressed by the 
current election spectacle. As one 
British commentator remarked. 
"American politicsha.~ gained inglam-
our what it has lost in credibility. And 
the sleek shall inherit the Eallh."

Associate Opinion Editor 

I believe in the individual"s right to take his or 
her own life. 

It's that ~imple. That's nor so terrible. is it'! 
No one consulted me when I c:lme into the 

world and. consequently. I cannot feel compelled 
to stay in this world if Illy life become~ a burden to 
meand toothers. lftheme;tning of human life does 
not consi,t in simply living. but in living as a 
dignilied hUIll;tn being and ac\:ording to the ,tan-

dard~ of mor.d freedoll1 . then m;1Il doe~ not e i~t 
primarily for the !><Ike of life. but in order to 
e>.ercise this freedom and experience this dignity. 

The taking of one's own life. while being in 
many way~ an ;IC t of destruct ion. i, ,,1;.0 an act of 
liberation in the true~t ~n~e . Self-inflicted death i~ 
not merely a "no" to life: it is a '-yes" to the idC'(I of 
a life without lonelines,. ho~tility. ~lIffering and 
compUlsion. It is. in many in~tance~ . a "yes" to 
dignity. mor.11 freedom and inner peace. 

Every individual has the right to live with 
dignity. No one is going to argile with that. or 
will anyone argue that de;lth is not an integral p:1I1 
oflife. Death is. in fact. that one aspect of life that 
all of humanity has in common. And to deny (III." 
human being the moral right to a dignilied death is 
to deny that individual one of the mo~t crucial 
mom I freedoms of a dignilied life. 

Right now. none of you has that right nor that 
freedom. and none of you lives with that dignity. 

In two shon days. the state of California may be 
the first place on the face of the eanh to specili-
c;lIly legalize active euthanasia. or physidan-
assisted death. for temlinally ill members of our 
democrJtic society. Proposi lion 161 gives tel1Tli -
nally ill patients the right to request aid-in-dying. 
One of the two physicians that certify the patient's 
condition may either inject a lethal sub,tance into 
the patient or provide that patient with the means 
to take his or her own life. Neither health care 

profe,~ional, nor privatt' health facilitie~ are re-
quired to t;Ike part in tho: progr,lIll if morally. 
ethi\:;lIly orrdigil1u~ly oppo~ed and the law would 
in no way affect in~uranc<, policie~. 

While it is obvioll' to many that the gn::ate~t 
motivation, behind oppo,i tion to the propo~al are 
mor.!!. ethical and religioll,!xliefs. Gayle En~ign.

tive should spell out a reasonable w;Iiting peri<x1 
between a patient'~ lir~t requc~t for help in dying 
and the carrying out of that request. 

In other words. if the patient tnlly \Vant ~ to go 
again~t "common law" and cnd hi ~ or her life in a 
quick dignified f,,~hion. they ~hould "t l ea~t be 
forced IOsuffera /i"/,, bit. But while ~u ffering Illay 
increase the individual 's piety in one person 's 
opinion. it certainly doe~n't in mine. 

The required waiting period., . cOlln~elings on 
alternatives and p~ychological evaluat ion, that 
opponents are demanding distinctly defeat the 
purpose of a patient \ request ing aid-in-dyir.g.

STUDENTS HAVE To "ROCK THE VOTE" 
Editor: 

Maybe we really are too dumb. 
Maybe we really are too ine peri-
enced. Maybe all people under 25 
hould ju t sit on our asses tomorrow 

and get rocked by the vote as the 
editor-in-chief of the Guardian ug-
gests in "Don't Rock the Vote" (Oct. 
29). Maybe you have to be over 65 to 
be pre ident, too. 

But let me tell you something: the 
outcome of thi election mean very 
little to those people over 65 and even 
Ie s to 68-year-old millionaire and 
66-year-old billionaires. The group 
with the greatest stake in the outcome 
ofthi election i us. people under 25. 
We are the one who are going to be 
most effected by this new pre ident 
and his policies. 

Ben Boychuk say we are too 
tupid "to make an informed deci-

sion." Yet, I know that every one of 
us i~ sman enough. We are man 
enough to understand p!.ychology, 
communication . math, economics 
and physics. to name just a few. 

This year we are fonunate enough 
to have a candidate who understands 
the problems as well as the diversity 
and promise of America. Bill Clinton 
i a regular guy. He is a man who 
enjoy. women. 'pon, . movies and 
mUllic. He is not flaw Ie s. He is a 
white male, yet he knows that the 
~trength ofthi. nation does not reside 
in rich, white men alone. He knows 
that it resides in the women and all of 
America' ethnic groups, He is young 
enough to have a stake in the fu ture.

not promising any miracles. He is 
telling Uloo that if we choose to believe 
in him and work together with him, 
we will make a bener future.

People who live in glass houses 

loohould not throw stones. Boychuk's 
anicle will probably not be favorably 
received, but thm is to be expected. 
After all. he is only an "intemperate. 
immature, self-indulgent, irrespon-
sible, ine perienced, shallow and 
brash" young person. 

Bill CI i nton appea Is to college stu-
dents because we are responsible, ca-
pable, concerned :lnd empathetic 
members of this country. And Bill 
Clinton will make a responsible, ca-
pable, concerned and empathetic 
president.

Somehow, I doubt that , tudents 

who are too overwhelmed by the vot-
ing process to pick a decent candidate 
are going to be interested in reading 
the Fet/eralisl PapC'rs, as Boychuk 

~ugge~ts, Frankly, I don 't even under-
Mand the logic of , uch a prescriplion 
for someone who t/oC's understand 
(but doesn't like) the choice set be-
fore her, Since when is reading about 
the abstraction of democracy a ubsti-
tute for actually panicipating in it? 

As vacuous as the MTV persua- • 
sion may be, and as undoubtedly valu-
able some knowledge of the Found-
ing Fathers of our government may 
be, isn't it imponant to shake our-
!.elves out of our apathy'! Yes, it's true 
that the more the "mas!.es" join the 
voting process, the more likely it is 
that people with relatively unsophis-
ticated political knowledge will be 
pulling the lever, People don't ud-
denlytr.lOlooform from completely apa-
thetic n;I([" into l-ophisticated politi-
cal analyMs overnight. Still, if they 
vote, it'.v a .1'/(11'1, 

Clinton is not perfect. He's prob-
ably not even what you would call 
great. I guess he has "panisan" appeal 
for me - but where do you draw the 
line between personal m0t!ves and 
nobler ones'! As a lootudent. I like the 
fact that he's strong on education, As 
a woman, I am glad that he suppons 
RIIC' \', Wat/C', 

Yes, I'll take a helping of "wide-
eyed" student idealism, howeversim-
plified, Maybe we could aI/ learn to 
aniculate our needs and gradually 
learn to speak of hopes, dreams and 
ideals as well.
