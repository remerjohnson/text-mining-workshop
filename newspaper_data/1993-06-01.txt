UCLA Senate Finds 
ROTC Discrimination 
L9S ANGELES - UCLA's 
Academic Senate recommended 
that the university renegotiate 
its Reserve Officer Training 
Corps (ROTC) contract with the 
U.S. Department of Defense 
because it violates the school's 
discrimination policy by 
denying gays and lesbians 
admission to the program and 
commissions after graduation. 
The senate called on UCLA to 
suspend its ROTC program if 
renegotiation fails. The decision 
comes after a year-long senate 
study. ROTC faculty members 
have urged the senate to 
reconsider its conclusions.

LOS ANGELES - Mark 
Pulido was unanimously 
reseated as undergraduate 
student lxx\y president by the 
UCLA council after he provided

Grassroots Communication 
Class Enjoys Its Day in the Sun 
EXPOSmoN: Students take part 
in 'extremely rewarding' projects 
for Thursday's event at the Hump 
By Rltu Saxena 
Staff Writer 

A group of UCSD students received first-
hand experience in "grassroots communica-
tion" when it put together a display on the Hump 
last Thursday. The event was part of the 
Grassroots Communication class-Communi-
cation as a Social Force 175 - which is offered 
once a year to students of all majors. 

1lle purpose of the exposition was to demon-
strate the effects of grassroots communication 
on various non-profit organizations, according 
to Phil Decker, a visting professor with the 
Communication Department. 1lleexpo featurid 

student-created projects that focused on such 
diverse subjects and groups suchas Battered 
Women Services, AIDS Awareness, Latch-Key 
Kids and gangs, among others. 

"The students of Grassroots Communica-
tion have been working really hard for this expo 
all quarter :md have gained a unique experience 
that is unlike any other class here at UCSD -
doing something for the community in an aca-
demic setting," Decker said 

Deckenklded that these projects will be used by 
the cormnunity to promote their organizations. 

Students described the course as extremely 
reWarding. Nick 1llomas, a student in the class, 
worked with graffiti artists. "The purpose of 
having these artists out here is to promote graf-
fiti in a positive way - these kids have a greater 
understanding of art and color theory than a 
four-year college graduate," he said. 

Faculty, Students 
Call for Repeal 
Of Loyalty Oath 
AWGIANCE: Biology professor 
turned down position at UCSD 
rather than sign mandatory oath 
By Joooa Palmer 
Staff Writer 

Graduate students and faculty have come 
together in support of Mark Konishi, an appli-
cant at UCSD's Biology Department who did 
not accept a professorship because he would be 
forced to sign the State Oath of Allegiance. 

All state employees must sign~heoath, which 
requires them to "support and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States and the Constitu-
tion of the State of Califomia." 

Responding to Konishi 's refusal to sign the 
oath, UCSD graduate students and faculty mem-
bers have started a letter writing campaign in an 
attempt to get legislators to repeal the oath. 

According to Biology Professor James 
Enright, Konishi was invited to join the Biology 
faculty at UCSD but refused as a matter of 
conscience, knowing that if he did, he would 
have to sign the Oath of Allegiance. Enright said 
Konishi hoped for a way around the require-
ment. 

"I don't see why an exception couldn't be 
. made .... I'm really .sorry to see that he's not 

going to be coming here. He 's a real gem of a 
professor," Enright said. 

Looking back at his own decision to sign the 
oath, Enright said, "I had just come from the 
status of a starving graduate student. I would 
have signed anything." 

Graduate student Matthew Belmonte is lead-
ing the effort to abolish the requirement. Ac-
cording to Belmonte, the oath is not helpful in 
any way and is virtually unenforceable. 

Belmonte added that the oath may also affect 
co-op employees. Because they are technically 
university, and therefore, state employees, they 
must sign the loyalty oath. 1bose who did not 
may not get paid

Division of Engineering Changes N arne 
The Division of Engineering at UCSD will now be 

known as the School of Engineeri~, following the 
approval of the Board of Regents at Its May 20-21 
meeting in San Francisco. The new designation had 
been recommended by the UCSD Academic Senate. 

Â·The name change will make absolutely no operac 
tional difference," said Dean of Engineering M. Lea 
Rudee, who added that the change will help eliminate 
confusion about the university's commitment to engi-
neering. 

"There are other universities and colleges who call 
their engineering unit a division, but they are much 
smaller than us. They are really glorified departments, 
so this was a misnomer on our campus," said Rudee, 
who will step down as dean at the end of the academic 
year. 

The School of Engineering has approximately 100 
faculty members and an undergraduate enrollment of 
about 2,000 students. 

Today'. Carillon Concert Will 
Honor Instrument'. Donor 

In honor of the 99th birthday of carillon donor Joe 

Rubinger, a special carillon concert will be held at noon 
today at the Central Ubrary. The 15ininute concert will 
be audible to nearly everyone on the UCSD campus. 

Muir College senior Till Meyo will perform an original 
composition on the carillon keyboard. His performance 
was commissioned especially for the event. Also perÂ· 
forming will be Jim Soe Nyun and Scott Paulson. 

UCSD Cancer Center Receive. 
$I Million Grant to Study Diet 

The UCSD Cancer Center was recently given a $5 
million pledge to fund a cancer research study by the 
Walton Family Foundation, Inc. The grant will establish 
an eight-year study of the connection between diet and 
the progreSSion and treatment of cancer. 

The grant will also support a new endowed chair 
named for Sam M. Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart 
Stores who died last year after a battle with bone cancer. 

"The gift from the Walton FamIly Foundation will 
greatly enhance the research programs of the UCSD 
Cancer Center, particularly in the exciting field of nutri-
tional studies in cancer treatment: said UCSD Chancel-
lor Richard Atkinson.

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

PINION 
YEAR IN REVIEW 

It doesn't seem that long ago that the 1992 presidential election was in 
full swing, the administration and the co-ops were at each other's throats 
and the Un i versi ty of California was sufferi ng underthe latest budget cuts 
from Sacramento. But that was then, and this is now. Bill CLinton is well into his first 
year as president. The co-ops and the administration are on the verge of signing an 
agreement that will save the co-ops from eviction. And the university . .. well. two out 

of three isn't bad. 
"Even the most feeble-minded 

can recognize that these people are the

CO ..... TARY: One last rotmd of volleys is aimed at the usual suspects, but escape from mall-culture is elusive 

THE PARTING THOUGHTS OF A CONDEMNED MAN 
By Ely Rabanl 
Staff Writer 

On the occasion that should have 
just preceded my graduation (a victim 
of Physics 2CL), I would have liked to 
address issues like population growth 
and the environment, globalization, 
etc., etc. Instead, the morass connected 
to this miserable little playpen has a 
way of imposing itself. 

Like others who have written for 
this rag, I'm bitter over the wasted 
years, over the marked absence of 
women from my life and over the 
dependable failure of people at this 
university and in general to bother to 
think. But here's one last stab. 

â€¢ Multiculturalism evidently leaves 
Gregory Stephens feeling "demon-
ized" that his "personal history is made 
invisible." He may feel that, but the 
point is that while it's a new experi-
ence for him, these feelings are the 
ordinary experience of many not like 
him. I don't attack Mr. Stephens for 
his race (not too different from my 
own), but I do question the adequacy 
of his proposed interracial politic. 

The goal of a multicentric com-
munity of difference and commonal-
ity is preferable to many of the alter-
natives, as he argues, butthe elision of 
historical context and what it means 
for people's identities and world-
views cannot be ignored. Nor can the 
fact that these are often in conflict-
not just the "limits of oppositional 
thinking" but persistent patterns of 
action. Getting "on with building a 
multicentric world" is neither 
warm 'n 'fuzzy nor easy. It means deal-
ing with these conflicts as well as 
respecting each other as people with 
valid experiences. Categories like 
"people of col;:,;-" that point out some 
common aspects of the experiences of 
many are part of it. 

Identity politics has serious limi-

tations, but it makes one crucial point: 
the validity of non-white, non-West-
ern, non-male experience. Could some 
feel threatened by such validity? Or 
commonality within it? If Stephens, 
upon rigorous consideration of his 
own actions and views, finds that he 
does not participate in the 
marginalization of other people or 
groups based on traditional stereo-
types, he needn't be so defensive 
toward multiculturalism. 

Darrel Menthe, in the "America, 
love it or leave it" tradition, writes of 
enslaved Africans: "Well, the first 
generation was robbed," of its cul-
tures, "but the succeeding genera-
tions have been new people. Why be 
burdened by history, chasing the 
ghosts of a mythical Africa because 
years of racism has left" some people 
feeling dispossessed. In other words, 
generational time and legalistic fic-
tions heal all wounds, so forget about 
what the past means for the present 
and future. Never mind the fact that 
the culture imposed upon these "new 
people" is adverse to their existence 
as full-fledged human beings and that 
aspects of this adversity persist to the 
present in so-called mainstream 
American culture. 

Further, we are told that to call for 
the (re)construction of cultural iden-
tities is "inventing historical fiction ." 
I wonder where Mr. Memhe thinks 
culture comes from -probably some-
where on high and out of the reach of 
the unwashed masses. While culture 
influences thought, it is participants 
that reproduce a culture. What I sup-
port is a synthesis addressing long-
standing injustices - earnest long-
term informed effort, not a "cobbled-
together pack of myths." This has 
nothing todo with historical revision-
ism, but pretending that injury is long 
past clearly does.

They just get w.".... 

Both Menthe and Stephens think 
that all privilege is identical to eco-
nomic privilege. Economic privilege 
is clearly important, but there are 
other layers as well, and white privi-
lege is not strictly reducible to eco-
nomic privilege. They may intersect, 
but that misses the point. Evidently, 
neither can tolerate the awareness of 
the fact that others face more ob-
stacles than they do - now that's 
victimology if I've ever seen it. Life's 
tough all over, but let's not pretend 
that it's just as tough everyWhere. 
These two may have valid personal 
experience, but that hardly means 
that others don't or shouldn't assert 
the fact. 

â€¢ The A.S. Council has before it a 
strong resolution to convene a consti-
tutional convention in fall. It's about 
time. Let's hope (or rather, insist) that 
they pass it in unmangled form. 

â€¢ The University Centers ~dvi-

sory Board (UCAB) has before it a 
proposal to allocate part of the Price 
Center to create a long overdue Multi-
Cultural Center. When thePriceCen-
ter was fITSt proposed, the description 
included an Inter-Cultural Center, 
which mysteriously never material-
ized. At last Monday's UCAB meet-
ing. University Centers Director Jim 
Carruthers remarked that he regarded 
all of the Price Center as a cultural 
center. 

Unfortunately, the culture here is 
one very particular kind: mall-cul-
ture. Ick! Butlhisdoesexplainasmall 
part of the decay UCSD has under-
gone since the Price Center opened ... 
A Multi-Cultural Center is an essen-
tial step toward meeting the needs of 
many in the increasingly diverse stu-
dent population. On top of the eco-
nomics of the last few years, many 
students of color have indicated that 
they feel isolated at UCSD, and this 
has contributed to attrition rates. 

â€¢ With some abstentions, the 
UCAB voted to pay to sue Chris 
B umen for legal costs incurred to the 
university by the Burnell v. Regents 
case. Various administrators are evi-
dently taking advantage of the legal 
ignorance of the committee to legiti-
mize its persecution of a student who 
dared to stand up for some of the most 
basic student rights. The administra-
tion needs nosuchapproval (the board 
is "merely advisory") but would have 
looked draconian (as if that's any-
thing new) for persecuting a student. 
The administration's legal savvy is 
itself quite limited, and they'll get 
theirs. But these deplorable actions 
should not go uncriticized. As for the 
student "representatives" who sup-
ported this move, let them know 
whether they are representing you. 

â€¢ It's time to admit a little bit of 
cynicism. I've spent much vitriol and 

processed wood fiber on dealing with 
cuts to education and the plight of the 
university -asad state of affairs. But 
there's a seamy underside to what's 
being defended. In many ways, UCSD 
is the int~llectual equivalent of a Roach 
Motelâ„¢ - the few creative minds 
that check in don't check out. They 
just get warped. Mine did. 

â€¢ Part of this cynicism has to do 
with the hypocrisy of the University 
of California as it has changed over 
the last few years. The average family 
household income of fIrSt-year stu-
dents admitted to UCSD in Fall of 
1992 was above $70,000 compared 
with under $30,000 in 1986. Califor-
nian families in general did not see 
corresponding growth in their in-
comes. In other words. the UC is 
engaged in the upward redistribution 
o/weallh. 

â€¢ Nowthatthe AS.,GSAandco-ops 
have agreed to a Memorandum of Un-
derstanding, the administration is up to 
bat. Win it reject, sign or play divide-
and-conquer games? It's an open ques-
tion. as is whether they'll evict the co-
ops over the summer and replace them 
with administration controlled retail 0p-
erations that look. to the casual and 
ignorant observer like the co-ops. 

â€¢ J'II close with two ideograms of 
the Tao Te Ching intended for a com-
mencement speech, rejected for be-
ing "really good but too sociologi-
cal." No matter. It probably would 
have made the relatives' brains hurt. 

Much knowledge will cormpl the 
heart, 
When parrly ullderstood, 
And so the people grow too smarr, 
But neither wise nor good ....

tiles,

whole issue could have been re-
solved. but the velY fact thm they' re 
not willing to reconsider shows that 
they're not reasonable." 

Prior to Watson's reaction , 
Groundwork Books co-op member 
Steve Dubb said the differences 
between versions are minor enough 
that the administration should sign. 

Following Wat on 's decision , 
Dubb said. Â·'Itcertainly appears that 
the administration is acting out of 
spite." 

A.S. Vice President Finance 
Neena Malik said the decision took 
her by surprise. "We has such a 
positive response from all the groups 
of students," she added. 

Tesak said Friday that because 
negotiations have been going on for 
nearly two years, the administration 
was likely to either accept the re-
vised memorandum immediately or 
begin the 6O-day eviction process. 
Watson chose the latter. 

Despite the failure to stop the 
eviction process, student leaders 
agreed Friday that the negotiations 
between the co-ops. GSA and A.S. 
were more successful than previous 
negotiations between the groups. 

According to Tesak. the meet-
ings were so successful because the 
AS. decided to step out of its role as 
mediator and become more student-
oriented. 

"We decided to stray from me-

AS. Commissionerof Academic 

Affairs John Sames said the A.S, 
also seemed more willing to negoti-
ate during recent meetings. "f think 
the questions we were considering 
were being presented in a lot more 
of a compromi e-oriented way," he 
said. 

Many student leaders also said 
the negotiations proceeded well be-
cause of aspirit of cooperation. GSA 
President Patrick Carroll said, "The 
past week, the new AS. Council 
demonstrated for the first time that 
students at UCSD can work to-
gether." 

"I think the main difference was 
that the A.S. was getting [otherpoints 
of view] ," Dubb said. "The co-ops 
finally got angry enough to read 
them the riot act." 

Students on all sides of the issue 
said they believed they had com pro-
mised in some way, though the final 
document was acceptable. "All par-
ties feel they compromised. There 
are always better documents [for 
each group]," Dubb said, 

Former GSA representative to 
the AS. Paul Eykamp said better 
documents could have been drawn 
up, but considering the difficulties 
presented by the negotiations, the 
memorandum was acceptable. 

Co-op members had been par-
ticularly concerned with a phrase in 
the memorandum that did not guar-
antee five-year lease renewals, as 
well as several other details of the 
document. 

In the revised version, the A.S. 
conceded the five-year renewal op-
tion. The co-ops also felt that they 
compromised in several substantial 

Last fall , Belmonte brought the 
matter to the attention of the Gradu-
ate Student Association (GSA). 
According to Belmonte, the GSA 
passed a resolution to make copies 
of the California Constitution avail-
able to prospective graduate stu-
dents and inform them of the conse-
quences of not signing the oath. 

Philosophy graduate student 
Aare Laak so agreed with 
Belmonte's statement. "It seems like 
an unfair piece of information to 
withhold from the potential gradu-
ate students." Laakso said, adding 
that the oath is probably left over 
from the McCarthy era. Laakso has 
written legislators to try to have the

ways, as well. 
Dubb said one of the major com-

promises involved the keeping of an 
"automatic termination" clause 
which states the co-ops' leases will 
be terminated if certain financial 
rules are violated, 

In addition, the co-ops conceded 
on the issue of a cholarship fund, 
Dubb said. The new agreement 
specifies that $10,000 jn co-op as-
sets will.be set aside for a scholar-
ship fund if a co-op chooses to leave

The GSA also compromised on 
several pointsofcontention.accord-
ing to Carroll. The GSA would not 
sign the previous memorandum pri-
marily because of a phrase saying 
the A.S. could pull out of the agree-
ment at any time if certain co-op 
responsibilities were overlooked. 

The GSA had argued for the 
power to override an AS. decision 
to withdraw. However, the AS. did 
not want the GSA to have power to 
veto decisions on A.S. assets.

Common Types of 
Sexual Faltasies: 
ExperIIII8IItat:IoG-These types 
of fantasies involve experiences that 
the v isualizer has never tried, such 
as starring in a pomo movie or 
having sex in a public place. The 
visualizer is excited by the forbid-
den nature of the fantasy but may 
not necessarily wish to pursue its 
realization, especially if the fantasy 
involves sex with animals, incest or 
being a prostitute. 

, 

Conquest- Power is the main 
element in this type of fantasy, 
since the ability to control or 
command a sexual situation is a 
turn-on to the visualizer. Common 
images often include slave-master 
relationships or positions of 
authority such as schoolmaster. By 
contrast, these fantasies can also 
include the idea of being conquered 
by someone. The victim might be 
forced to be humiliated or wear 
unusual items of clothing. 

Swttclllng Partners-- The 
fantasizer imagines having sex with 
someone other than a current 
partner. It could be anyone from a 
neighbor to a salesclerk to a 
relative. This is one of the most 
common -Fonns of sexual fantasy, 
and it is not unusual for both people 
in a relationship to have this vision 
while having sex. A sub-category of 
the "switching partners" fantasy is

MENTAL 
MASTURBATION 
'Even normal students 
can have wild and 
kinky sexual fantasies 
By Nicole Saint John 
Guardian Reponer 

, 
OU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE 
great? To screw in a 
space shuttle. Can you 
imagine Ihe kinds of 
things people could do?" 
says E'van, a Revelle first-
year student. 

When it comes to 
sexual fantasies, not even 
lhe sky is the limit. 
Fantasies differ greatly 
from person to person, 
and having what you 

might consider an "abnonnal" fantasy is, in fact, 
quite nonnal. Researchers say many people are 
reluctant to share their fantasies for fear of being 
labeled a pervert. But fantasy in almost all fonns is 
a nonnal, healthy part of a person 's sexuality, and 
students in the '90s do not lack in creativity. 

"Everyone has sexual fantasies," says Dr. Philip 
Raphael, a counseling psychologist at UCSD. Only 
in rare and specific cases can these fantasies be 
considered unhealthy. Raphael says that it is only 
when thoughts or behavior become obsessive that a 
fantasy can be considered detrimental to emotional 
health. 

According to Raphael, it is nOI for us 10 
detennine what is kinky. There are no objective 
means of deciding what is nonnal or deviant. The 
only lines a psychologist can draw are at the points 
where someone gets hurt. "What do you think a 
chain would feel like?" asks Raphael. 

Famed sex researchers William H. Masters and 
Virginia E. Johnson write in their book Sex and 
HI/man Loving, "Sexual fantasies ... provide a safe, 
protected environment for engaging the imagination 
and letting our sexual feelings roam. A mild-man-
nered, genteel college professor can fantasize about 
orgies with the three attractive coeds in the first row of

his classroom without risking his ten-
ure or reputation." 

................ 

One sophomore feels that after 
coming to UCSD, her fantasies be-
came "more specific. They were sim-
pler before I came to college." 

Raphael explains that many indi-
viduals struggle with serious relation-
ships for the flISt time and begin ex-
ploring intimacy during college. As 
they define their own identity, they 
often have trouble abstracting them-
selves from the beliefs with which 
they were raised. 

Those who choose to reject values 
they were taught, says Raphael, some-
times experience guilt. Similarly, if 
one's sexual fantasies diverge from 
what one was taught to consider"nor-
mal," feelings of dirtiness or abnor-
mality may result. 

Many UCSD students agree that it 
is embarrassing to talk about sexual 
fantasies. They laugh, tum red and 
resi t talking about it, but nearly all 
interviewed insist that they feel no 
guilt discussing their fantasies. "I like 
it. It's kind of fun." says one Revelle 
sophomore, "probably because it's 
not something I'm used to talking 
about." 

One junior says that she thinks 
people are reluctant to openly discuss 
fantasies because "some people rip 
on one artOther." 

"It's kind of private," says another 
sophomore student. . 

While many students claim that 
they have no qualms about sharing 
their fantasies with others, they are 
careful to assert that they are "nor-
mal" and would do "nothing too 
kinky." 

''I'm not into whips and chains 
and shit," says Evan. 

"I want her mom and dad ... watch-

Students with strict religious be-

liefs note little change in their sexual 
fantasiessincecomingtocollege. But 
most students report that as their fa-
miliarity and experience with sex 
changed, so, too, did their sexual fan-
tasies. 

"I realized there's more 1 can do

tasies). There has to be more experi-

"I'vestill gouageta single (room), 
though," says another student. 

Dream lellion 
One female UCSD junior shares 

her "ultimate" sexual fantasy. 
"I have a specific person in mind. 

It is a composite of a few guys. I want 
it wild, but I want it like a natural 
scene, out in the woods, in a gazeb? .. 
there's nudity," she wams. 

Masters and Johnson note that it is 
common for people to fantasize about 
having sex with someone under per-
fect conditions and in a romantic set-
ting, often outdoors. 

The UCSD Guardian 

"We have black satin sheets. There 
are flowers close by. I love that 
smell," she says. 

She continues, "First the normal 
thing... kissing. cuddling. Then he 
begins to kiss me on the neck and ear. 
Oh, God, I love it. Then I would like 
him to touch me. I am fully clothed in 
silk. There is heavy petting. I like 
when he touches me." 

She describes how she would 
slowly kneel down. "Then I rip off his 
buttons with my teeth. Jeez, I know 
it's kinky. but I want to unzip his 
pants with my teeth. Then I might kiss 
his groin area with his underwear on. 
I am fondling his groin area with my 
mouth. 1lten I stand up again and he 
kisses my neck. I love that, so it's like 
an erotogenic zone." 

"I'm wearing a dress with azipper 
in the back. He unzips me with his 
arms around me. I am facing him. He 
removes my bra. In had to make love, 
I want him to strip me, and I want to 
do the same to him, not 'fuck.Â· Then 
he lays me down and he starts kissing 
my chest and my tummy," 

''1lten he removes my underwear 
with his teeth. I want him to kiss me, 
everything by his mouth. Oh, God, 
I'm still in this oral phase. [want it to 
be a clear, warm night near a lake or 
some brook or whatever," she says. 

Masters and Johnson write, "The 
opportunity. to visualize oneself in a 
certain form of erotic activity -oral-
genital sex, for example - allows 
one to anticipate some problems that 
may occur. By replaying a scene sev-
eral times, fantasizers can develop a 
better idea of how to minimize diffi-
culties ... awkwardness, embarrass-
ment or surprise." 

She continues, "Okay, then he re-
moves his underwear. He continues 
kissing ... God, this is so sick. Then he 
eats me out." 

'The penetration portion should 
come in at this time,"she says. "We're 
inthemissionaryposition. Then while 
he's doing that. he pulls my legs up to 
his shoulders. We are still going at it, 
and he pulls out because we're mak-
ing a mess." 

She hesitates and notes that in her 
fantasy, she would also be on the pill, 
and both she and her partner would be 
HIV negative. Often, elements of the 
real world intrude into the fantasy t9 
make the fantasizer feel more secure. 

"He ejaculates. We relax. We 
cuddle. He kisses me and sucks my 

breasts," she says. 
A Iiule later that night, they would 

do it again in an "animalistic posi-
tion ... doggy-style. I learned a lot from 
this [sexual positions) book." 

"This rear-entry sex is pretty 
quick ... I don't know. I never did that 
before," she says. 

Sex researchers note that the thrill 
of the unknown and the untried is 
important to fantasies, and is often 
employed to overcome sexual bore-
dom.

"We'd cuddle more ... and then I 

would give him a blow job," she says. 
"It would be nice if he told me how 
much in love he is with me ... I don't 
just go for the physical. 

"Some people are attracted to the 
physical only, but I can't do that. I'm 
a feelings- and emotions-type person. 
There have got to be mutual feelings 
for one another." 

"We are kissing and fondling all 
night," she says. "We fall asleep. I am 
in his arms. The next moming, we lie 
together and talk. He kisses me on the 
mouth. r m pretty tired. We take a dip

so we play around. We use the towel 
to dry off. He towels me off." 

Commenting on her fantasy, she 
adds, "it makes me feel happy ... homy, 
too. I want to do it." 

Many people would gladly trans-
fonn their fantasies into reality, but 
this is not true in all cases. Others 
would prefer to keep their fantasies in 
their minds. In some cases, acting out 
the fan~y would "spoil" the forbid-
den appeal of it. 

Fantasies often reflect the situa-
tions and relationships that people 
find themselves in. As conditions in a 
persOil'S life change. so too do sexual 
fantasies. One woman who was the 
subject of a Mastersandlohnson study 
reported that her fantasies mirrored 
the problems that afflicted her mar-
riage. While she and her husband 
were having marital problems, she 
would often fantasize that she was 
making love with other men while her 
husband was forced to watch in hu-
miliation. After some successful mar-
riage counseling. she felt less of a 
need to retaliate, and her fantasies no 
longer involved scenes of humiliat-
ing her husband. 

The female student explains that 
her embarrassment in talking about 
her sexual fantasies has to do with 
other people's perceptions of her. 
"People think I am so innocent, and it 
might be shocking to others that I 
have thoughts like these ... adventur-
ous. almost wild or something." 

Indeed, con ventional notions hold 
that female fantasies are "tamer" than 
those of males. B ut i .. ~asters and 
Johnson note that in recent times, the 
fantasies they have collected from 
women have become more explicit 
and detailed, hinting that the fantasies 
of both sexes have never been very 
different, and that women have only 
been socialized into thinking their 
fantasies should dwell more on ro-
mantic and emotional elements. 

And not all male fantasies follow 
standard porn-script formula. Casey, 
a Revelle sophomore, shares his: "I 
go to Yosemite. We just go hiking or 
camping. We'd hike into Hetch 
Hetchy, the reservoir, and we go in 
the water 'cause we're not supposed 
to." 

''1ltere's this one place along the 
edge of the water, and there's a water-
fall." he continues. "There's a pile of 
rocks,like a huge boulder, and wecan

"I don't know. We could have a 
sexual experience in there. It'd be real

"When we're done in there. we

Meadows and spend the night out

In this instance, the female student 
was more concerned with sexual de-
tails than the male. He says, "The 
details would come later. I wouldjust 
let them happen. They would work 
themselves out." 

Nicole, a Revelle junior, explains, 
"I don't think gender's an issue here. 
If she has a boyfriend. I think she'll 
have someone specific in mind, but if 
she's single, then she won't."

Stones singer Mick Jagger when-
ever she had sex with someone. In 
the course of her travels, she

that she still had to conjure up her

common, and that chances are high 
that both individuals in a relationship 
have had similar fantasies at some 
time. 

Sometimes, a person may be tom 
between the excitement of a particu-
lar fantasy and feelings of guilt or fear 
for having such a fantasy. Many 
women may feel unsettled at having 
recurring rape fantasies, or a hetero-
sexual male may be confused if he has 
erotic homosexual thoughts. 

Sex researchers say there is no 
evidence that sexual fantasies reflect 
actual personality traits or values. This 
may bring some consolation to people 
with strict religious beliefs who nev-
ertheless find themselves fantasizing 
about explicit or "unusual" sexual 
practices. Sexual and personal values 
may differ wildly from fantasy lives. 

Likewise, having a fantasy that 
depicts what many consider "strange" 
does not always mean that a person is 
inclined to act out that fantasy. 

Either way, sexual fantasies seem 
to be part of most every college 
student's life, and can be" gratifying in

cussed among friends. Once shared, 
many find that their fantasies are not

to seem more likely, especially in light of 
the ongoing UC budget crisis. The possi-
bility of enrollment cuts has administra-
tors and students talking. 

A.S. Commissioner of Public Rela-
tions KUI1 Marek said that the A.S. Coun-
cil will not endorse any more fee hikes or 
reductions in enrollment to meet the 
budget shomal\. Either option would be especially 
ham1ful to economically disadvantaged and minority 
students, Marke said. 

According to figures from Student Research and 
Information. the number of UCSO's incoming first-
year students in cel1ain underrepresented groups has 
dropped slightly from since last year. 

For example, 63 African-American students have 
enrolled here for next year, compared to 66 one year 
ago. Larino enrollment is down to 47 students from last 
year's total of 62. 

Only the numbers of Chicano and Filipino students 
have increased since 1992. The total number of new 
first-year students accepts, however, has dropped from 
2,7l7t02,637. 

By cutting enrollment, Marek said, the university 
risks "lowering these statistics even more." 
What 11Iey're Saying About Enrollment 

At last week's meeting of the Board of Regents, 

Pehason conceded thallhe university 
may no longer be able to enroll all 
qualified students who wish to enter a 
UC school. 

"If we are forced to restrict enroll-
ment, however, we must do so in a 
fashion that will enhance diversity so 
that our student body will reflect the 
diversity of tile people of California," 
PeItason added. 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph Watson said that while reduc-
ing enrollment is one possible option 

of dealing with the budget shol1fall, it "seems inappro-
priate, especially at a time when the number of high 
school graduates is increasing. 

" It is my opinion that reducing enrollment should be 
one of the last things that' s done," said Watson, adding 
that enrollment cuts would hul1 future generations of 
students. 
What'. BeIng Done 

The A.S. is currently exploring other options to deal 
with the budget shomall, Marek said. These options 
include calling formorecuts in the upper administration 
budget and lobbying the state to increase its allocation 
to the UC system. According to Watson, other options 
that could be explored include getting more money 
from the state and increasing faculty workload. 

"Right now the A.S. is looking to get students, 
faculty and staff together to lobby the state. We're 
building a coalition. It's not just students getting cut by 
the budget," Marek said. 

ShrInking Enrollment 
The total number of first year students 
who have declared their intention to 
attend UCSD asofMay 14 has dropped 
slightly from the totals of last year. 
Among certain ethnic groups, the nunr 
ber of accepts has also declined.

Skipper Lyle Yates Dedicated to ExceHence 
By Jeff Praught 
Staff Writer 

Every year when summer rolls 
around in the South, the weather be-
comes wild with HXklegree days and 
gut-wrenching humidity followed by 

softball-size hail 
and massive 
downpours of 
rain. Tornados 
pop up here and 
there,butoncethe 
clouds dissipate, 
it's back to the 
dog days of swn-
mer. As the skies 
clear, you can 
look out to the 
sandlots between 

the pecan trees and the lemonade stands 
and find kids enjoying America's fa-
vorite pastime. In the dust and heat, they 
do their best to imitate the Pete Roses, 
the Mickey Mantlesandthe Willie Mays 
of the Major Leagues, withthe hope !hal 
one day they too will be smashing home 
runs and rounding bases. Indifferent to 
the events of the world around them, 
these boys live out their childhood fan-
tasies on the baseball diamonds. 

Lyle Anthony Yales once lived in 
such a setting, but the 39-year-old Mira 
Mesa man has found himself in a com-
pletely different world. Residing in hec-
tic Southern California might seem to 
be a roadblock to Yates' drive to be a 
baseball man, but such has not been the 
case. 

Yates is the current skipper of the 
Triton baseball team. In his 12-year 
UCSD coaching career, he has trans-
fonned a perennial bottom-dwelling 
team into a winning program. 

Thurs. June 3

His assistant, Tom Cartier, feels that 
Lyle is a marquee manager because 
"he's always organized and always pre-
pared. Once he gets that game face on, 
he's pretty forthright." 

Yates' success comes as no surprise 
toanybcxlywhoknowshirn. In 1953,he 
was born into a lifeofbaseball in Merid-
ian, Mississippi. It was a rare day when 
he was not playing ball on the fields 
nearby. The fowth son of Frank: and 
Sanh Yates, Lyle Ieamed how to play 
ball from his older brothers, Frank Jr., 
Mike and Joe. When younger sister Liz 
was born, the boys even talked her into 
playing ball. "We were drinking, sleep-
ing, eating and living baseball," Yates 
said. 

With a childhood revolving around 
baseball, Yates and his friends never 
witnessed the racism surrounding them 
in the South. Meridian was separated 
into white and black sections, and his 
elernenraryschool was segregated How-
ever, the love for baseball had the power 
to unite kids of any race. 

"My family was not raised into preju-
dice. I never saw a Ku Klux Klan 
member, and to my knowledge, our 
neighbors weren't known to be racist. 
But then again, as kids, we were pretty 
isolated from what was happening 
around us," he said. 

His life in the South came to an end 
in 1964, when the family packed up its 
bags and headed west for Salem, Or-
egon. Interestingly enough, familymern-
bers were outraged to find out later that 
they had sold their Meridian home to a 
Grand Wizard of the KKK. 

The move to the Pacific Northwest 
proved to be quite a transition, since 
Yates discovered a poor, unexciting 

"[I went from] a bach-
elor who had let ba â€¢â€¢ 
ball dominate [my] 
life to a man who 
finally wa able to 
..... (my] life with 
SOIII8OII8. "

quality of baseball. Still, he continued to 
play in city league and high school. 

Yates' Southern accent brought him 
some teasing among his new friends. 
Other kids would stare at him, amazed 
at how strange his voice sounded. He 
recaJled the many times in class when 
all the other kids would stop raising their 
hands just as Yates raised his hand so 
that they could listen to his Southern 
accent with curiosity. 

High school seemed to be the turn-
ing point in Yates' life, in tenns of his 

connection with baseball. He had al-
ways wanted to play professional ball, 
but because of his size, it was evident 
that he would not have much opportu-
nity to reaIize this dream. After transfer-
ring to South Salem High, he became 
involved in coaching Babe Ruth base-
ball, worldngwithpiayersonlyayearor 
two younger than he was. 

After playing ball in the American 
Legion, Yales accepted an academic 
scholarship to attend Oregon State Uni-
versity. Unfortunately, it was a decision 
he wouldregre1,asthe Divisionl coaches 
agreed !hal he was too small to play. and 
he was cut. 

"It bothers me that I didn't go to a 
smaller school, because I probably could 
have made the team there instead of 
trying to make the ream at a Division I 
school," he says. 

Yates then turned his attention to 
coaching. With previous high school 
coaching experience, he knew he had 
the talent to handle the job and only 
needed a break to get started. 

After a year of coaching junior col-
lege ball, Yates got his big break in 
1981. He traveled to La Jolia to partici-
pate in the fall program for UCSD, and 
Triton Head Coach Mike Abruzzo was 
impressed. He was offered an assistant 
coaching position, and despite the poor 
pay, dropped out of Oregon Slate and 
took the job. 

His bold move paid off when, in 
January of 1982, the head coaching 
position became available and Yales 
was selected to take over the UCSD 
program. 

During his ftrStyearat UCSD, Yates 
took his troops across the PacifIC, male-
ing the Tritons the flIst American team 

ever to playa game in the People's 
Republic of Olina. He has since taken 
tearns into the Phillipines and Japan. 

Yates, married in August of 1989, 
admits he changed from being "a hach-
elor who had let baseball dominate his 
life, to a man who finally was able to 
share his life with someone." 

But Yales still maintains a full-time 
dedication to baseball. He spends count-
less hours making lineups, taking care 
of fields, scouting teams, preparing 
charts and instructing players. 

Yates and wife, Karla, are expecting 
their first child this sumner. Thecouple, 
devoted Olristians, looks forwardtothe 
challenge of raising a child., 

HI just want to be able to raise a 
fanlily in the proper manner. It's some-
thing that we both really W3l1l, and the 
timing is right, " Yates said. 

For the man who has endured a 
lifelong obsession with baseball, father-
hood will provide a greater challenge. 
He admits that although it may kill him 
to do so, he will have to spend less time 
with baseball. 

Even with anew family in progress, 
Yates still hopes to advance further into 
the world of baseball, possibly on the 
field or in a front offICe job for a minor 
league ballclub. He finished his educa-
tion at San Diego State in 1988 and 
eameda Master's degree in Sport Man-
agement in 1992. 

Yates still keeps his Southern roots 
alive. despite being away from hisorginal 
home for over 25 years. He hopes to 
raise his family in a srnall-town envi-
ronment, allowing his children to expe-
rience the same memories he has grown 
to cherish .â€¢ That's just the old Southern 
boy in me," he says.

PllRllIiIT 
It's Only J1Dle 
In the NL West 

Before all you Giants and Dodger 
fans go ordering the champagne, you 
might want to take a dose of reality 
here. June is upon us. and as anyone in 
baseball will teU you, it's June through 
September when pennants are won. 

As much as I hate to admit it, the 
Giants are not going to be able to hold 
on to their lead. Sure, their offense is a 
modem.<Jay version of Murderer's 
Row, starring Clark, Williams and 
Bonds. But thc:t pitching is eventually 
going to cost them. Staff ace John 
Burl<ett may have started the season at 
7-0, but the guy doesn't scare anyone. 
He just makes batters get themselves 
out He'll get knocked around his fair 
hare of times. Bill Swift is the only 

other quality starter Manager Dusty 
Bakef has in his arsenal, but the Giants 
have to pray that his arm holds up. 
Maybe Barry Bonds should join the 
rotation. They could use a solid lefty 
and get their $43 million worth, too. 

It's never been a secret that Atlanta 
has the best starting rotation in baseball. 
They've got John Smoltz, Tom Glavine, 
Steve Avery and Greg Maddux - aU 
Cy Young material. It doesn't matter 
that the Braves are barely hitting over 
the Mendoza line when these guys are 
tossing shutouts all the time. 

I bet there are a lot of people 
jumping on the Dodgers' billxtwagon 
right about now. That II-game winning 
streak has propelled them all the way up 
to three whole games over the .500 
mark. If they had the Braves' pitching, 
maybe they'd be a threat, because 
nobody could hit the ball to their 
pathetic defense. Instead, they have 
Orel, who is never going to be as good 
as he was. Ramon Martinez can be 
awesome one day, and batting practice 
the next. Tom Candiotti is a pitching 
machine for Little Leaguers, and Kevin 
Gross? I don't think so. Has anyone 
seen Darryl Strawberry or Eric Davis 
lately? Don't get too excited about this 
team, except when it battles Houston for 
fourth place. 

Houston doesn't have the hitting to 
keep up with the Braves and Giants, and 
Cincinnati doesn't have its mascot, 
Marge Schott, to put a scare into 
anybody. More importantly, Cincinnati 
doesn't have a competent front office to 
make those late-season trades vital to 
winning a pennant. Firing Tony Perez 
made about as much sense as betting on 
Buffalo to win a Super Bowl. As for 
America's sweethearts, the Padres, you 
can make advanced reservations for the 
big series with the Colorado Rockies 
near the end of season. Those battles for 
sixth place are always exciting. 

This leaves the Giants and Braves to 
battle it out. This race might be decided 
by whoever breaks his slump faster, 
Will Clark or Terry Pendelton. But 
remember, the Giants started the month 
of June in first place and finished the 
month in fourth place. There is no 
reason that can't happen again, although 
they wouldn't fall as far. Look for 
Atlanta to meet Philadelphia in the 
NLCS.

Five All-Americans Crowned 
TRACK AND FELit Matt In<'V .. .-. C3:1~ medal; Erica Washington takes second in 100 meters 

By BrIan K. Hutto 
Staff Writer 

Rising enemy track and field stars have fi-
nally discovered a foolproof method to rid them-
selves of pesky Triton track speedster Erica 
Washington, versatile Man Inskeep, middle-dis-
lance gurus Pat Foy and Mark Yuen and titanic 
hammer thrower JeffTaylor.1lle solution comes 
none to soon in the eyes of fellow conference and 
national foes. It's called graduation. 

In the fmal meet of their college careers, these 
athletes along with eight other Triton competitors 
made the trek east to the Division ill National 
Track and Field Championships held at Baldwin-
Wallace University in Berea, Ohio, last week. 
1lle women fmished tied for 19th place ( 12 points 
), and the men ended up II th with 18 points. 

Senior Washington qualified fourth on 
Wednesday for the ~meter final (25.01) and 
went on to take fifth in Friday's final (24.91). 

Afterqualifying fifth in the l00-meters (12. 18) 
on Thursday, Washington showcased her spe-
cialty by speeding to her fastest time of the year 
in Saturday's final (12.11), but could not over-
take the new Lincoln University speed champion 
Shawna Hardy (11.96). Her second-place finish 
eamedWashingtonherlOthAII-Americanhonor 
in her four-year UCSD career. 

"[Washington] decided to run both [events], 
instead of just concentrating on the 100. She ran 
her second-fastest time ever in the 200 and ran 
great in the 100," said Head Coach Tony Salerno. 

Also living up to expectations was All-Ameri-
can Matt Inskeep, the 1993 Division ill decathalon 
gold-medal winner. 

Inskeep was in second place after 
Wednesday's first five events, which included 
the 100 meters (11.24), long jump (22'4"), shot 
put (3T5"),highjump (6'3") and the 400 meters 
(50.26). He quickly seized the lead during 
Thursday's finale, which consisted of thelOO-
meter hurdles ( 15.67), discus ( 115'4'" pole vault 
(14'4"), javelin (173'6', and the 1,500 meters 
(4:36.93). Inskeep outpointed second-place fin-
isher Tom Reason (7,002 points) of Albion Col-
lege to capture first with a total of 7,014 points. 

four-time All-American ErIca Washington captured second In the 100 meters on Saturday. Inskeep's total set a new UCSDschool record, 
previously held by John Serrano (6,990 points), 
set in 1980.

American awards. ,...14 

Triton Jeff Taylor qualified third with a marie 
of 187 '5" in the men 's hammerthrowon Wednes-
day, and teammate Curtis Williams barely 
squeezed into Friday's final in 12th position 
(168'8"). But Taylor fell well short of his best 
(20 I ' I ") in the finals, winding up fifth with a 
throw of 188'5". Williams moved up to eighth 
place with a mark of 174'2". Both garnered Al1-
American honors. 

Pat Foy also gathered All-American honors 
in the 800 meters, finishing sixth in 1:52.71. 
Teammate Mark Y uen did not make the 800 
meter finals, despite running a faster qualifying 
time, due to the meet selection process. 

Other national competitors for the Tritons 
included Renee Sprowl (12th in long jump, 
I T2",triplejump, 35'8.75'" WafaHanna (ninth 
in the 3,<XX> meters, 10:23.65), Stefan Wynn 
(1,500 meters, 3:59.4) and John Castner in the 
5,000 meters. Damian Coleman, who finished 

ChUCk N',IIyen/GUMdIBII sixth in last year's event, reinjured his ankle and
