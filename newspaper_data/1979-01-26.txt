Von Hoffman Eases up Victims 
By Eric Jaye 

Mana,in, Editor 
Washington Post columnist 

Nicholas von Hoffman, for 
year a critic of presidential 
abu e of power, spoke a few 
kind words for his victim 
Wednesday night in Mandeville 
Audilorium, claiming that the 
presidential office wa not 
nearly as powerful as the 
American people like to 
believe, 

The idea of a weak 
presidential office may appear 
strange', von Hoffman said, 
" but it's not as eccentric as it 
may seem," 

According to von Hoffman, 
the "imperial presidency" is a 

relatively new rallacy 
contrived by what he called 
"cold war liberals ." 

In the early ixties. he ·a id. 
the libenll in power had 
strongly sUPPol'ted the war in 
Vietnam. Later in the decade 
as these liberals were leaving 
power while the war wa 
turning sour "they needed an 
excuse for what w~nt wrong. " 

"They looked at Johnson und 
Nixon and said ·they did it. ' .. 

But. according to von 
Hoffman, the Presidents had 
not been acting in an imperial 
fashion and waging an 
unwanted war. The Presidents 
did nothing, he sid, without the 
consent of the American power 

sU'uclure, And when the 
consent of the Congres and the 
power structu re wa · with-
drawn, the war ended, the 
Presidents hewing very litlle to 
do with it. 

Though the fuct don't 
su pport the notion, the 
American people would till 
Ii ke to believe in the presidency 
as un impcrial in itulion. von 
Hoffman said, 

He likened it to the American 
version of the Mikado , " We 
want it to be splendid. we wunt 
it to shatter the eye ." vo n 
Hoffman said. . 

But. von Hoffman warned. 
"be not deceived." Succe ful

DevelopmenOt Near Mesa Planned 
By John Hondros 

Associale News Edilor 
The impact of a proposed 

commercial and residential 
development, to be located 
directly east of Mesa 
Apartments, on the University 
will be discussed at a meeting 
of the UCSD Campus and 
Community Planning Com-
mittee next week, accordin& to 
Campu and Community 
Planner Patricia Collum. 

The planned development, 
ca lled " Brittany Village," 
cons ists of a multi-level , 
integrated complex containing 
479 condominiums, 147 
apartments , a 198-room inn and 
120 , 000 square feet of 
commercial uses. 

The complex will be located 
on a 27.5 acre site north of La 
Jolla Village Drive between 
Regents Road and Genesee 
Avenue. The developers of the 
project are Lomas Santa Fe, 
Inc. 

" When looking at it by itself, 
it's a fairly good project," said 
Collum. "But looking at it in the 
context of the community, 
some dense traffic problems 
will be generated - La Jolla 

Village Drive and Genesee will 
become the worst intersection 
in San Diego." 

Collum believes the com-
bination of all the dev lopment 
around this intersection, rather 
than " Brittany Village" alone, 
will bring about traffic 
problems in the UCSD area. 
" It's just going to take longer to 
get ~n loVMre" . h . d... 

According to the Environ-
mental Impact Report on 
" Brittany Village," presently 
in draft form , "the complex will 
generate an estimated 17,600 
trips per day ." Mitigation 
measures include widening and 
restriping Genesee A venue 
La Jolla Village Drive and 
Regents Road. The report 
states that resident and visitor 
parking will inevitably occur on 
segments of Regents Road -
" This will directly aCCect the 
campus," said Collum. 

A pedestrian overcrossing 
extending east-west through 
the "Brittany Village" 
complex, which will connect 
with the Towne Center and the 
proposed office comple?, 
(across Genesee) , is al 0 
planned. However. according 

to Collum, the project proposal 
does not clarify if there will be 
pe.destr.ian access acros 
Regents Road. 

Another finding presented in 
the EIR is that development of 
the property will re . ult in the 

complete destruction of a rure 
and endangered plant species. 
the Ophioglo sum californicum 
fern. which i abundant on the 
site. During the year. the 
discovery of additional 
Ophioglossum habitat has b en 

significantly Ie s than the 
destruction of known habitat 
by u factor of five . according to 
the EIR . 

The project may benefit

Torah Describes Judaic History 
By Teresa Tokar 
and Stan Honda 

To the naive eye, it seems to 
be nothing more than a large, 
weathered roll of paper wound 
around two massive wooden 
needles. But when one 
examines it more carefully and 
learns that it is over 500 years 
old, n survivor of the Nazi 
holocaust and a symbol of 
many of the teachings and 
traditions of Judaism, Solon 
Rosenblatt' Torat Mosheh 
(the Torah of Moses) one is ' 
suddenly filled with a special 
awe . 

Rosenblatt, a Warren College 
student. is only the temporary 
caretaker of that Torah. Next

welcome the Torah to the 

institutions to receive one of 
1564 Tora hs which were 
rescued from a wnrehouse in 
Czechoslavakia in 1964. The 
Torahs had been stored in the 
warehouse since the time of the

Of Pigs, 
A riend of mine from lAS Angeles says that ,in Vernon, an all-

industry city near LA 
that sports several large meat-
packin, companies, there IS a 
three-block long mural paying 
homage to the pig. People 
driving by see pigs at play, pigs 
in repose and pigs picking up 
their tasty cargo of cancer-
causing sodium nitrite before 
the final trip to your 
supermarket or Denny's 
breakfast. 

The message is clear: In 
Vernon, one does not speak ill of 
the pig, because the pig stands 
(or jobs (or thousands and good 
financial health for the city of 
Vernon. 

Lots of people in the south feel 
the same way about tobacco, 
you can smoke it, chew it, spit it 
or pack it, but you'd better love 
it. And it is the southern tobacco 
industry that provides the 
clearest picture of the power of 
political influence in the 
otherwise complicated re-
lations h ip between U. S. 
businessmen and consumers. 

Ft'w industries get away with 
conti.lUed and overt damage to 
their customers' . health . The 
government bans a host of 
drugs and food additives, 
supervises much food proc-
essing, requires seat belts in 
your car and prohibits the use 
of narcotics , for instance. Ford 
Motor Co. was indicted last 
summer for reckless homicide 
in connection with the deaths of 
teenagers in an exploding 
Pinto. And a toy company last 
week saw fit to apologize 
immediately when one of its 
spaceships shot a plastic bullet 
down the throat of a four-year-
old and killed him. The other 
toys are being recalled and 
replaced, albeit belatedly. 

Yet the government happily 
allows manufacture of 
cigarettes which millions of 
people use to irreparably 
damage their lungs - and pays 
a bunch of southern fat cats 
millions in farm subsidies to do 
so. 

Because of a president who 
would be a borderline 
candidate for renomination and 
re-election without the support 
of the same southern states that 
keep the rest of us in the cancer 
ward, the courageous personal 
campaign against the world's 
only state-subsidized health 
hazard by HEW secretary 
Joseph Califano Jr. may be 
muted. Jimmy Carter has not 
thrown the weight of his 
administration behind Cali-
fano, preferring to think the 
way to reduce the danger of 
cigarettes is to somehow make 
less dangerous cigarettes. 
. Califano, who talks op-
timistic2Uy about an overall 
decreaSE in the percentage of 
people who smoke and 
hopefull: ' about better public 
education programs, clearly 
isn't thi1Jking along the same 

Pintos, 
lines of Carter. Tbough Cew 
people would advocate a ban on 
cigarettes, no more than they 
would suggest outlawing Cheap 
Trick recqrds because people 
play them too loud and hurt 
their ears, it doesn't take much 
to see the · bankruptcy oC such 
encouragements as high school 
smoking areas and oC the 
continued subsidies oC the 
tobacco industry. Especially 
when the money is used to buy 
elections and to fund such 
organizations as the Tobacco 
Institute , which blithcly 
maintains that the 30,000 
medical studies that went into 
Califano's latest report are 
wrong and that smoking and 
disease have not been 
conclusively linked. (Re-
member the pigs in Vernon.) 

The industry's political clout 
extends further than the' 
Tobacco Institute's dem a-
goguery. In the Jan. 22 Time 
magazine, which sported an 
amazing nine full-page 
cigarette ads ( representing 
almost a (jfth of the ad space in 
the issue), a story a bout 
corporate physical fitness 
programs received three times 
as much space as the HEW 
report, though the latter 
represented a major policy 
initiative by top federal 
officials. Time recorded the 
industry's predictably anti-
regulation, anti-government 
responses to the report without 
even mentioning the millions in 
subsidies. The story got the best 
play on television , from which 

Tobacco and. Power 
Marlboro country was thank-
fully deannexed some time ago 
by the Fedetal CommunI-
cations Commission. 

The press has trouble 
handing business accounta-
bility stories in general. Last 
summer, when Ford was 
indicted over its killer Pintos-
with gas tanks that could have 
been made safer but weren't to 
save Ford money - the Los 
Angeles Times gave Peanuts 
better play in its geneml news 
section, while the same day's 
financial page featured a big 
story, complete with Clattering 
pen and ink sketch, about 
Ford's new president. The 
second story didn't mention the 
Pintos, as if such a simple 

matter of profit maximization 
und human minimizution were 
insignificant on the business 
puge, where the economic 
health of a nation is all that's 
important. 

The press spends most of its 
time following around hapless, 
harried public officials, while 
business reporting is often 
confined to stock tables und the 
vicissitudes of corporate 
leadership. cOmpanies that are 
asked to stop hurting people, 
cheating them or stealing from 
them complain about govern-
ment interference. and the ' 
public, which reads about 
almost nothing but excess 
government, swallows it. 

A good example was the 

saccharin controversy. The 
FDA. using the only methods it 
cou Id short of pouring 
saccharin doWn the throats of 
deuth ' row convicts Ilnd 
captured illegal aliens, said the 
sugar substitute could cause 
cancer. But a few congressmen 
and senators, who know more 
about power politics than they 
do about biochemistry, howled 
about how silly itis to make rats 
drink "six cases of diet Pepsi. " 
The issue died. So do we. 

It was the same story in 
California last June, when the 
tobacco people set up a dummy 
political action committee and 
proceeded to buy a "no" voteon 
Proposition 5, the anti-smoking

Women '$ Movement Divided on Issue 

Rights of Rapists Defended 
By Jeffrey Kaye 

Pacilic News Service 
"He was patient...He was a 

gentle rapist. .. 1 haven ' t ever 
run across any other person 
like that." • 

A gentle rapist. The words 
jar, clash, fall with a thud: 
Gentle rapist. 

The speaker is a woman -
not the vicli m but a Los Angeles 
attorney named F. Ela'ine 
Easley. 
(Prodded by women's organi-
zations, 44 state legislatures 
have toughened penalties for 
rape, But in California the fight 

. against harsher. punishment is 
being led by women too, 
Tougher rape penalties, tbey 
argue, don', help women. Tbey 
just erode civil liberties and 
strengthen opponents of ERA, 
Jeffrey Kaye is a Los Angeles 
freelance writer whose articles 
have appeared in ~ew West and 
other national publications.) 

Though she denies being 
spurred on by a grand "cause," 
and adds, ''I'm just a defense 
attorney, being paid to do the 
best I can," Easley finds 

herself in the eye of a political, 
legal and emotional hurricane 
because she defends rapists in 
cou rt. 

Her controversial views on 
rape have divided the women's 
movement, provoked political 
controversy in California, and 
helped make right-wing "law 
and order" activists and 
militant feminists unexpected 
allies in many parts of the 
country. 

Most important, what Easley 
herself describes as her 
"premise that rapists are 
human beings who have civil 
rights" raises fundamental 
questions about due proceSE 
and the delicate balance in our 
society between the rights of 
the accused and the victims of 
brutal crime. Is rape a crime so 
heinous it always deserves the 
severest possible punishment? 
Or should the law -as it does in 
cases of homicide ranging from 
manslaughter to first-degree 
murder - differentiate 
between degrees of rape, and 
penalize them accordingly? 

Do stronger rape laws erode 
basic freedoms for everyone? 
And what approach best 

protects women from rape? 
Easley's appeals on behalf of 

convicted rapists have not 
answered these questions. But 
they have intensified a national 
debate on rape. 

Easley's "gentle rapist" is 
Daniel Caudillo. As a result of 
her successful appeal on his 
behalf to tile California 
Supreme Court, Caudillo, 31, is 
now elibible for parole after 

-less than three years in prison, 
even though he earlier was 
convicted of kidnapping , 
forcible rape, sodomy, oral 
copulation, first -degree 
robbery, first-degree burglary, 
and inClicting great bodily 
injury with a knife. 

The victim, a woman named 
Maria, testified that Caudillo 
accosted her in her apartment 
elevator and put a knife to her 
throat , forcing her to return to 
her apartment ~here he 
blindfolded her. Over a two-
hour period, according to the 
court, she " was pushed, 
shoved, cut twice by a knife, 
raped, sodomized and abused 
to the point of vomiting, 
diarrhea, and hysteria ... 

However , California's 
highest court accepted 
Easley's argument that 
Caudillo had not inflicted what 
the law calls "great bodily 
injury" on his victim. The issue 
was not merely one of 
semantics . In California. 
crimes involving "great bodily 
injury" automallcCllly incur an 
additional threC'-year sentence. 
Until Easley appealed on 
Caudillo's behalf, the statc's 
courts had acted on the 
assumption that rape auto-
matically involved such injury. 

So, with its 5 to 2 ruling in 
favor of Easley's client, the 
court did much more than 
reduce Caudillo's sentence and 
make him eligible for parole. It 
ma ndated a whole new · 
approach to rape. To get the 
sticrest possible sentence, the 
prosecution henceforward had 
to prove not only that OJ rape had 
occurred. It had to prove it had 
been particularly violent. 

The Culifornia Supreme 
Court's decision outraged 
many in the women's move-
ment. It also fueled righl-wing 
efforts to unseat Chief Justice 
Rose Elizabeth Bird who had 
stood with the majority. The 
campaign against her included 
a TV ad depicting the Caudillo 
rape. 

Voters decided , last Novem-
ber. to confirm the chief 
justice. But the furor aroused 
by her court's decision on 
Easley's appeal has helped to 
weld the unlikely alliance 
between conservative "law and 
order" legislatorsand women's 
movement activists. Both have 
vowed to continue fighting the 
trend set by the CaudillO 
decision. 

Ironically, both Chief Justice 
Bi rd and attorney Easley 
personify the emergence of 
women within the con -
temporJry struggle for equal 
rights. 

Bird is a firm civil 
Iibel'tur,ian . Easley worries 
th4lt rape is being treated as" 
politicul football rather thun " 
serious judi 'ial and human 
question.

Stat~ Senate Okays 
US Convention Bill 

SACRAMENTO (AP) - A 
resolution backed by Gov. 
Edmund Brown Jr. calling fora 
cons titutional convention to 
force a balanced federal budget 
clea red the state Senate 
yesterday despite warnings it 
could trigger a constitutional 
crisis. 

After more than 21h hours of 
often bitter debate, the upper 
house approved a measure 
demanding the convention if 
Congress fails to adopt a 
co nstitutional amendment 
requiring a balanced budget. 

The 24-14 vote, three more 
than the 21-vote majority 
needed. for passage, sent the 
proposal , SJR 2 by Sen. Jerry 
Smith, D-Saratoga, to the 
Assembly, where Speaker Leo 
McCa rthy, D-San Francisco, 
has vowed to try to kill it. 

Congress must call a 
co nvention if 34 states pass 
resolutions requesting one. So 
far, 24 have done so. It takes 37 
states to ratify constitutional 
amendments. 

Much of Thursday's rancor 
was aimed at Brown by f Ilow 
Democrats, who accused thc 
governor of jumping on the 
convention issue to a id a

I certai nly will not support

Another Democrat. Sen . 
David Roberti , D-Los Angeles, 
called Brown "the Pied Piper of 
recession" because oC hi s 
fervid support of conservative

Supporters said a resolution 
including a convention 
provision was the only way to 
insure an end to the deficit 
spending they claimed is the 
major cause of high inflation. 

They said safegua rds in the 
resolution calling for a

and the pedestrian mall. 
Subsequent phases will 
co mplete the condomi nium

that the development program 
will extend over a five to seven

Tennis Team Fac~s Tough Competition 
By Karen Hunler 

Sports Editor 
When Coach Tad Yamaguchi 

and the men's tennis team 
travel to Arizona this weekend 
they will be missing the 
services oftwo of their top three 
players. 

Midterms and other com-
mitments will keep the team's 
number one tennis ace, Paul 
Metsch , and another top 
player, sophomore John 
Rosenberg, back at UCSD as 
six players make the trip to 
battle it out against the 
University of Arizona and 
Arizona State University tennis 
teams. 

Yamaguchi admitted that 
this weekend's matches will be 
" tough" against the two 
scholarship schools. His line-up 
is still not definite and he feels 
he probably will "do some 
switching around in the order 
for each match." The team 
takes on ASU on Friday, U of A

College where he was the 
number one player, and Dan 
Ben-Ora, original ly from 
Scotsdale, Arizona, will Dlso

According to Yamuguchi this 
year's squad has "good overall 
depth and strength. Except for 
Paul (Metsch) , we have no 
overall outstanding player. 
They all are excellent players, 
very solid, but Paul is the 
definite number one man." For 
the next six positions on the 
ladder after Metsch, Yuma-
guchi feels that it is a toss-up"

surprising, perhaps not - 60 
Minutes, a one-of-a-kind and 
the sole semblance of quality

programmers have duly noted 
the "trends" and, as is their 
wont , have diligently at-
tempted to follow them, but 
success has been hard to come 
by: Schlock is by its very 
nature nearly impossible to 
duplicate: NBC's Weekend has 
had negligible results in trying 

the Plebian 

to emulate .. MlnuleS; and 
even the T'n'A shows have had 
a large percentage of failure -
most conspicuous were 
American GI rh, which 
completely lucked redeeming 
values, and the repugnant 
Flying HIIb, which was even 
worse. 

But the programmers still 
believe that. Sex Sells and 
they'll continue to go to great 
lengths to prove it, so it's not 
surprising - they gave us The 
Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders 
- and in a choice timeslot, no 
less, Sunday night at nine, 
following BatUeslar Gallac-
tica, the hugely successful 
thirdrate ripoff of Star Wars 
(itself a second-rate ripoCf of 
the Western movie genre). 

. What was surprising was how 
serious the filmmakers took 
their subject. The treatment is 
(relatively) unsensational and 
it even touches on some of the 
broader implications of 
American's obsession with sex

its base in horniness and is 
laden with concepts such as 
sublimation and othe r 
Freudian saws. Joan (Judith

arouse anything in the \' iewer. 
There is , I think, a seminal 
problem with this play . On 
may ay, " yes , there are people 
like this; yes, aren't they silly 
and petty, but after all, wno 
cares about these people in a 
dramatical way? What price

that they parla ke generously in

coming up with a dejldlish stare 
for the two of them and Bert 
wordlessly holding up two

lifted his unfinished beer to his

a commun for ~ years 
or more. 

The role of the Torah in the 
Jewish community continued 
on into the time when Hitler 
came to power and the 
holocaust began. Many of the 
possessions of Jewish homes 
and synagogues, including 
Torahs, were packed up and 
sent to be stored in warehouses. 
Many of these warehouses still 
exist today and still contain the 
items which were brought to 
them during the holocaust. 

Rosenblatt explained the 
Nazis' purpQse in doing this: 
the Nazis had planned to open 
museums of Jewish belongings, 
especially Torahs, a long with 

of the Torah • In 
flamboyantly decorated 
furniture and pianos. The 
Jewish community would then 
be presented as cultur<llly 
fruitful and at the same time 
the Nazis would have appeared 
as powerful for being able to 
overpower and eradicate the 
people of this ingenious culture. 

Up until 1963, nobody except 
for officials in cities such as 
Pragut· knew about the 
warehol'ses and what W<lS 
inside of them. Most people had 
assumed that the Jewish 
possessior.s confiscated during 
the holocaust had either been 
destroyed or taken into N<lzi 
homes . 

But during that year, Eric 
Estorick , a British art 
connoisseu r , tra veiled to 
Czechoslavakia to look Cor art 
items to sell. About that time. 

Czechoslav<lkia was in need of 
money because of economic 
problems. so the Czecho· 
slavakian government offered 
to sell a collection of To r<l hs 
from a warehouse to Estorick. 
Estorick and Ralph Yablon. a 
friend of Estorick, together 
railled t he money to buy the 1564 
Torahs from the Czechosla-
vakian government. at the cost 
of at least a few million doJl<lrs 
(no one knows the exact 
figure) . The Torahs had a 
special <lppeal for Estorick, a 
Jew himselr. The Torahs were 
taken to Westminster Syna-
gogue (formerly the Earl of 
Kent's house) , where they 
arrived on February 7, 1964. 

After their arrival at 
Westminster Synagogue. 
scribes began the task of 
repairing the Torahs, some of

Jewish Communities 
which were in quite poor 
condition . Rosenblatt des· 
cribed the restoration of the 
Torahs as .. a very complicated 
J·estoration project, which only 
a scribe can do, for he knows all 
of .the rules ." There are very 
few scribes left in the world 
today: thus. the Torah 
restoration project is still 
continuing. The intention of the 
restoration project is to 
eventually donate each of the 
Torahs to synagogues or other 
i·nstitutions . Accord ing to 
Rosenblatt , these Torahs are 
very much in demand. because, 
" these 1564 Torahs represent 
6 ,000,000 human lives ." 

Rabbi Moss of Temple Adath 
Shalom .a lso desired to possess 
one of these Torahs . To help 
him obtain one for his 
synagogue, Moss contacted 
Rabbi Herman of Los Angeles, 

who in turn conlilcted Paul 
Rosenblatt Solon's father, in 
England. 

When Solon arr ived in 
England last December to 
spend the winter break with his 
family. he was taken to 
Westminster synagogue. where 
he was shown the 1100 Torahs 
which a(;e still being restored. 
Ruth Sh afre r . Honorary 
Secretary of the Memorial 
Scrolls committee. gave Solon 
the Torah to take home with 
him when he would arrive back 
at UCSD for the winter quarter. 

Parts of Rosenblatt·s Torah 
were replaced during the 
Restoration and other eras of 
history. Although some of the 
ink is beginning to chip off 
because of its old age. much of 
Rosenblatt 's Torah ha s 
remained intact during its 500 
years of existence. 

Sex on Television 
(Continued from page 8) 
as ide) . True. the movie 's 
premise is simpleminded: 
accepting at face value the 
assertion that the Cowboys 
Cheerleaders a re "every guy's 
secret fantasy " and, by 
implication , that every 
woman's secret ambition is to 
be a Cheerleader. On the other 
hand , this project was given a 
decent script, at least one good 
actress (Jane Seymour) and an 
illusion of quality. This could 

mean the networks are willing 
to explore this intriguing 
phenomenon in greater depth: 
most likely it means they plan 
to produce a lot mor e 
superficial programs like The 
Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders 
in the future .

man Defends Rapists' Rights 
(Coad _ pg~ J) 
excited," says, "They can 
get people to jump on the 
bandwagc real easy - the 
Caudillo 0 sion shows that," 

Elaine asley is blunt . 
outspoken and deeply com-
passionat,! towards her clients. 
many of whom have been 
convicted of sexual assault. She 
emphasizes that she does not 
"condone rape in any form." 
But she also feels "people are 
getting hysterical- about rape. 
women especially . They 
probably want to take rapists 
out and shoot them. They don't 
consider them human beings." 

Easley. 40. speaks slowly and 
q~et1y , Her speech and 

breathing are impaired as a 
result of a bout with polio in her 
youth. The disease left her 
pa ralyzed Crom the waist up: 
her arms hang limp by her 
sides. She walks with difCiculty. 

She has practiced law for 
almost six years. two-and-a-
half of them as a C<.Ilifornia 
deputy public defender 
drawing up appeal for indigent 
clients. 

Even when the crime is rape, 
criminals should be treat~d 
individually, she believes. " I 
think you have to start from the 
premise that these people are 
human befngs . and they have 
civil rights, What are you going 
to do with them. execute them

asked the commercials. though 
the initiative was as much of a 
grassroots issue as Proposition 
13. 

The approach of the tobacco 
industry. in its Proposition 5 
campaign and otherwise. to 
influencing the Ameri ca n 
people is infused with callous 
deceit. That the industry 
continues to mumble about 
personal freedom and free 
enterprise when virtually 
every doctor and researcher 
in the country says cigarettes 
kill hundreds of thousands of 
people every year is a glari ng 
indictment of the moral state of 
the industry. 

But tobacco hucksters are 
only the most obvious example. 
Free market economic theory 
is fine as long as each consumer 
understands all the con-
sequences of his choices in the 
marketplace. But the world has 
become v~y compli~ated. and 

so have the goods and services 
we buy. Each consumer cannot 
be expected to understand the 
chemical reactions that happen 
in his body when he eats 
'processed (ood: a woman 
should not have to be able to 
predict the effects on her 
offspring of hormone or birth 
control pills. 

Yet the same economi c 
theory flag-waving business-
men tout tells us that if an 
industry can save money 
skimping on a product without 
anyone noticing for a while, it 
will. Each time a producer 
complains about " big brother" 
and " exce s government," he 
could be aggravated over some 
'attempt " excess government" 
is making to protect con-
sumers.

all, or keep them in prison 
forever?" she asks, 

E<.Isley is continuing her 
struggle to win speedy release 
for Daniel Caudillo, a nd 
women's groups are shocked 
that after the brutal assault of 
Maria just three years ago he 
may soon be out on the streets. 

It W<.lS Easley's argument, 
and the California Supreme 
Court's judgment, however, 
that the offense did not meet the 
legal criteria of "great bodily 
injury." The knife cuts were 
superficial. The reason the 
ordeal lasted two hours , 
according to Easley, was that 
Caudillo "was patient. " She 
kept saying, ' I can't do it, 1 

can't do it.' And he'd wait, and 
he'd wait , <.Ind he'd wait. And 
finally he said she had to satisfy 
him before he left . <.Ind I think, 
fin<.llly . he forced her." 

E<.Isley uses the C<.Iudillo c<.lse 
to illustrate her contentiort th<.lt 
there should be graduated 
degrees in the penalties for 
r..tpe, depending on the degree 
of violence of the ass<.lult. 

" I have seen from one .:!.,d to 
the other what can happen, " 
she remarks. "A gIrl who · 
spends all night mak:ng out 
with a guy, and then he forces 
her into sex - I think th<.lt's a lot 
different from a little old lady 
who's w<.llking down the street 
<.Ind gets be<.lten up <.Ind raped:' 

It isn't that Easley wants the 
law to be soft on rapists, she 
says. Instead, she feels that 
indiscriminate penalties for 
rape are ineffective. " I don't 
think the death penalty WOuld 
be too stiff," she ays of <l 
recent California case in which 
a teenage hitchhiker was r<.lped 
and her arms hacked off. 

E<.Isley is not the only woman, 
however. fighting against a 
monolithic attack against rape. 
Feminists have split lately or. 
issues related to the crime. 
particularly on whether 
evidence on the victim's sexual 
history should be barred. and 
on whether it should be illegal 
for a husband to rape his wife. 

an Easy Scapegoat 
mercials, -that it's OK to pour 
nutritionless junk into their 
stomachs. It mayor may not be 
a First Amendment issue. but 1 
wonder whether John Adams 
ever imagined he was 
protecting the rights of 
salesmen to appeal to his 
children. via a glowing TV tube, 
before the rest of the family is 
even out of bed. 

It is fashionable now to think 
that government is our biggest 
enemy. A toll-free number has 
been set up in Washington so 
people ca n turn in lazy 
bureaucrats. for instance. No 

' one thinks that will lead to 

undue harassment of federal 
employees by citizens . But (joes 
anyone remember the indig-
nation that spewed forth from 
the business community when 
the People 's Bicentennial 
Committee suggested three 
years ago that secretaries turn 
in crooked bo ses in the 
corporate world ? 

Government is easier to 
complain about. because your 
property and income tax bills 
come in lump sums. But add up 
how much you pay to the 
private sector each year. How 
many of those expenditure 
were "voluntary," apart from 

whether you made them to 
Von 's or FedMart? How much 
freedom do you have to do 
without food, shelter, transpor-
tation , medical care and 
clothing? 

Think about that next time 
the Chamber of Commerce 
complains a bout government 
red t<.lpe. Remember there was 
less of it a few years ago in 
Detroit; when Ford engineers 
realized they could save a few 
bucks per Pinto by moving the 
gas tanks closer to the rear 
bumper.
