Juarez now head of 
Border Commission 
Will examine alien problems in new light 
BY PETER MORTEN EN 

News Editor 
Richard Juarez, upervisor 

of field tudies for UCSO's 
urban and rural stu die 
program, has been appointed 
by Gov. EdmundBrownJr. as 
executive director of 
California' Southwest 
Border Regional Commis-
sion. 

Juarez will assume the 
directorship of the San Diego-
based commission later this 
month. He plans to remain on 
the UCSD faculty through 
the end of the quarter, but he 
has not decided whether he 
will remain after that time. 

In administrating the 
commission, Juarez would 
first like to fully evalu ate the 
pro I.) ems that face the US-
Mexican border area and 
then take action "to impact 
these problems." 

The commi ion ' juri dic-
tion includes an ~iego, 
Imp erial and Rivers ide 
Counties. There, he ays, the 
people s uffer from a 
depres ed eoonomy due to a 
lack of tran portation. 

"The job deficiency in this 
region i because the area is 
not well s erv ed wit h 
transportation facilities. We 
don 't have a manufacturing 
economy because oft hat, " he 
said . 

One way Juarez sees to 
improve the economic 
situation in t he border area is 
to build up t he olar industry. 
" The solar industry is 
booming. There are many, 
many jobs there. " 

To "facilitate cooperation 
and coordination" of the 
commi sio n' program, 
Juarez feels that it will act as 
a "border lobby" to alert 
local, state and federal 
agencies to the area's special 
problems. 

Juarez met with the 
governor on Wednesday to 
discuss his appointment, 
which is now subject to 
aproval by the tate Senate. 
"My own political philoso-
phies areconsi tent to a great 
extent with the governor's," 
he said. "I basically serve at 
his plea ure." 

Juarez i t he third 
executive director of the 
commi sion in three years. 
"I'll erve at least two more 
year ,to he aid, noting that 
hi term as director is 
dependent on how long 
Brown remain in the 
governor's office.

Tom Hayden, who sits as 
Brown' alternate on the 
commi ion, interviewed a 
number of candidates for the 
job, but recommended Juarez 
to Brown for the appoint-
ment. BY LISA SULUVAN 

In a decision that affects 
government to atcess to 
per onnel hiring files on all 
UC campuses, UC Berkeley 
has disclosed its confidential 
faculty hiring files to the US 
Department of Labor rather 
than face a cutoff of $25 
million in federal contracts. 

The precedent-setting 
agreement came last Friday 
after a lengthy dispute over 
the right of the university to 
prevent federal access to its 
records. 

The accord provides that 
all UC campuses must "lend" 
files to the Labor Department 
if higher government officials 
find them relevant to 
investigations of job bias. 
The Labor Department, 
however, must return the 
documents, and cannot make 
copies or expose them to the 
public - the university 
retainin~ custody of the files. 

The dIspute began in 1979 
when the Labor Depart-
ment's Office of Federal 
Contract Compliance 
Programs sought to examine 
and copy 466 Berkeley files 
that they deemed necessary 
to thorough ly review 
allegations of job discrimina-
tion on the basis of race and 
sex. 

According to Quelda 
Wilson, assistant academic 
affirmative action coordina-
tor, "UCSD won't be affected 
immediately, however, as a 
part of the UC system, UCSO 
will com,ply with the 
agreement. 

UC Berkeley ' history 
department withheld the 
documents citing concern 
that public expo, ure - third 
party acces to t he records -

tion procedures - cou ld 
, ubject faculty members to 
intimidation and abus . 

[n some ca. e~ informat ion 

relating to military technolo-
gy or commercial trade 
secrets mu t be safeguarded 
from potential competitor. 
They further argued th~t 
releasing such records would 
effect the integrity and 
candor of the faculty 
evaluation process. In 
defense they pointed to 
recent increases in the 
precentage of minorities and 
women employed. 

TIle university initially 
agreed to let investigators 
probe the hies and make 
notes, but refused to 
duplicate the documents or 
rehnquish possession. This 
position was upheld last year 
by Thomas Schneider, an 
admini~trative law judge 
with the Office of Federal 
Contract Compliance 

Program. UC, like thou-
and of federal contra tors, 

is ubject to anti-di crimina· 
tion laws. 

Secretary of Labor Ray 
Marshall rejected the ruling ' 
in lieu of a new agreement. In 
a 78-page ruling, Mar hall 
acknowledged the univer i-
ty's substantial efforts to 
comply with the Labor 
Department and he set new 
compromising condition ~. He 
then ordered UC to accept the 
conditions within 30 days or 
else lose $25 million in funds. 
After Berkeley Chancellor Ira 
Michael Heyman conceded 
that "a successful outcome" 
of taking the issue to court 
was certain, a consent decree 
was signed between the

Profs spending less 
time with students 

BY RANDY HILL 
During the 1979·80 

academic year, full-time 
regular UC faculty members 
spent an average of 5.3 hours 
per week teaching regularly 
scheduled courses, represen· 
ting a steadily declining 
trend that UC President 
David Saxon believes should 
be reversed. 

The statistics, from an 

independent survey released 
this week , howed that 
faculty members spent 
approximately 27.5 hours per 
week on instructional 
activities last year, including 
12,5 hours of direct student 
contact activities, 10.1 hours 
of oourse preparation, and 
4.9 hours of other activities 
such as grading papers. 

Council rejects proposal The average faculty member spent over 62 hours a week in university-related 
activities . In addition to 
instructional duties, faculty 
spent an average of 23 hours 
on research, 7.5 hours in 
university service, and 5 
hours of pu blic service.

Resist - your life 
isn't Uncle Sam's 
Editor: 

The shift in liberal 
attitudes from the Civil War 
period to the Vietnam War 
period is startling and a bit 
lrighteninll. Abraham 
Linmln, in his Gettysburg 
Address, described the 
United States as a govem· 
ment "of the people, by the 
people, and for the people." 
John F. Kennedy, in his 
Inaugural Address was the 
author of the phrase: "Ask 
not what your muntry can do 
for you, ask what yoo can do 
for your country: 

It can be ar~ed that a 
government is different from 
a rountry or nation, that 
governments rome and go 
whereas a country or nation 
is more permanent. How· 
ever, the United States of 
America as a muntry, a 
nation, has not known 
anot her sovereign and 
sucx:essfUl government other 
than the one s« up under the 
Constitution of the United 
States of America. And both 
Linmln and Kennedy were 
c:oncemed with the same 
thiqa - the relationship of 
the American citizen to the 
US. 

A a!Iltury 180, the ideal 
government served the 
people. Now, the ideal people 

serve the government. This 
shift reflects the growth, in 
size and power, of the State in 
our lives, of which draft 
registrat ion is only one small 
example. For all we might 
think of Kennedy as a 
progressive president, his 
words would inspire the 
totalitarian. Hitler, or Stalin, 
could have mouthed them 

tryin~ to rally the German, or 
RUSSian people. And it is the 
idea that we are obligated to 
serve the State, instead of 
demanding that the State 
serve the people, that is 
objectionable. It is also the 
starting point for why we 
need to resist draft 
registration. 

Forget, for the moment, 
that there has never been 
registration without a draft, 
and never a draft without 
war. Forget, for the moment, 
that the potential soldiers of 
any future war - those 18, 19 
and 20 year·olds who 
registered - are as likely to 
be fighting against a war of 
national liberation in EI 
Salvador as rescuing 
American hostages in Iran or 
rolling back the Russians in 
Afghanistan.

registration is a way of 
saying that the lives of young 
men are property of the State, 
and that the State can decide 
how, when and where to 
dispose of them. Or, as 
military recruiters are so 
fond of pointing out: "Kid, 
yoo owe six years of your life 
in military service to your 
country. And if you happen to 
die, oonsider it an honor." 

This is the fundamental

Radiation may have 
reached California 

BY NORMAN SOWMAN 
A 12·hour delay in 1Wtijying ground monitoring stations following the September 25 nuckllr testJeok in Nevado. may hove 

resulted in inaccurate measurements of off-side radiation. 
Norman SoIomaJl, who is co-authoring a book ·on radiation 
victims, wrote this for tM Pacific News Service. 

SALT LA~ CITY - Following detection of radioactive 
leakage from a Sept. 25 nuclear bomb test in Nevada, the 
Department of Energy delayed 12 hours before alerting the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is charged 
with off·site radiation monitoring. 

The delay, some officials and scientists believe, may have 
prevented accurate measurements of the spread of radioactive 
gases from the test. 

The Department or Energy (DOE), which supervises the 
atomic testing in Nevada, originally said that the radiation 
was "not expected to leave the Nevada Test Site." However, 
the EPA later reported detecting radioactive gas, Xenon·I33, 
at a ground monitoring site 40 miles southwest of the test in 
Lathrop Wells, Neveda, just ten miles from the California 
border. 

Because of the delay in official notification of the incident, 
neither federal nor California officials were able to set up 
monitoring equipment in time to measure the possible drift of 
the gas into California. 

"Unless you've got a big wall there, the gas just kept 
moving," said Dr. Leonard Storm, a noted geneticist and 
expert on nuclear test activities at the University of Nevada at 
Las ·Vegas. "It didn't stop at Lathrop Wells," he speculated. 
"It kept on going." 

Utah and California health authorites say they learned of 
the radioactive leak from the media four hours after the EPA 
was notified and 16 hours after it occurred. 

"There was an obvious communication screw-up over at 
DOE," said Chuck Costa, EPA deputy director for nuclear 
radiation assessment. "They should have called us much 
earlier than they did." 

A spokesman for the DOE, Davelackson, responded, "We 
feel that they were notified in what we considered to a timely 
manner. That was the way it was, and I have no further 
comment." . 

The Director of the California Department of Health 
Services, Beverlee Myers, in a letter to the DOE manager of 
the Nevada Test Site, has requested "all data and reports 
pertaining to the Sept. 25 gas release." She also stressed the 
need for "appropriate notification mechanisms so that we can 
effectively respond to future radiation releases from the 
Nevada Test Site." 

Said Myers, "These weapons tests have presented a health 
hazard in the p,ast, and we're concerned that they might again 
in the fUlure. ' 

In addition to the controversy over the delay in notification, 
some experts have also expressed concern that radioactive 
gases other than Xenon·l33 may have been released. 
Aocording to the EPA, Xenon-I33, which is less dangerous 
than ot her radioactive ~ses, was the onlv su bstance from the 
blast picked up by off-site monitors when they were finally 
turned on. Xenon·l33 was monitored at 44 picocuries per 
cubic meter of air at Lathrop Wells - about 20 times the 
normal ba£kground radiation level - not enough to represent 
a health hazard, according to federal officials. 

Dr. Karl Z. Morgan, 'professor of nuclear engineering at the 
Georgia Institute of Technology and a leading expert on 
radiation effects. said that t he failure to promptly monitor the 
release may account for the apparent absence of other 
radioactive gasses. "The first few hours are the most 
iml?Ortant,:' he said. "If y.ou don't make.your measurements . 
when the cloud is going over, it's too late." 

Morgan said he believes "there's no question that there was 
a release of other noble gases," as well as possibly other 
radioactive isotopes such as Iodine·131 which i extremely 
dangerous. 

A nuclearchemi t and government consultant, with over 20 
years experience of monitorin~ nuclear fallout, went beyond 
Morgan's conclusion, but requested anonymity. He termed 
the DOt: accou nt of the incident "absolutely ridicuiQus.1f you 
have one fis ion product, like that Xenon·l33 they've 
admitted to," he said, "you have all the other, including

Tragic age s ·een in 
poem~ of Laureate 

BERKELEY, CA -
C zeslaw Milosz, the 
Lithuanian · born exiled 
Polish poet and winner of the 
1980 Nobel Prize for 
literature, said yesterday his 
poems are "a response to the 
tragic experiences of the 20th 
century ... 

Milo z, a professor of 
Slavic languages at the 
Univer ity of California at 
Berkeley, was awarded the 
coveted literary prize - this 
year worth a record $212,000 
- by the Swedish Academy 
of Letters in Stockholm. 

The forceful, 69·year·old 
instructor, described by one 
of his colleagues as "one of 
the great living masters," 
expressed delight' that the 
Nobel Prize was awarded to a 
writer in the "exotic Polish 
language," but displayed 
surprise at a campus press 
conference that the honor fell 
to him. 

"I am very surprised by the 
Nobel Prize because I 
practised just the oppo ite of 
public appeal," he said . "This 
is the first time that a poet of 
the Polish langua~e has 
received this award.' 

Milosz described himself as 
a solit ary man and said his 
success stems from hi s 
having two profe sion -
college professor and writer. 

Earlier this year , Milosz 
was given the Faculty · 
Research Lectui1! at the 
university, a prestigiou po t 
and the highest honor the 
faculty can award its 
members. 

The urbane Milo z, when 
asked how winning the 
Nobel Prize would affect his 
life, said merely, ''I'd like to 
have my class today." 

He declined to respond to 
critics charges that the Nobel 
Prize is awarded for political 
reasons. 

Milosz, who said he doesn't 
know what he'll do with the 
money, is the 11th Nobel 
Prize laureate from the 
Berkeley campus, and the 
only one who i not a 
scientist. 

During the press confer· 
ence, he read electionslrom

Quasars, black holes and other space phenomena explai!led 
BY JONATHAN KROLL 
The heavens may appear 

peaceful, but "the universe 
around us is full of violent 
activity," says Dr. Gene 
Smith, professor of physics 
IftCI member of the Center for 
Astrophysics and Space 
ScienCes (CASS). 

In Wednesdar's first 
"Adventures in Research" 
lecture. Smith gave his 
audience a toar of the 
universe through an 
extensive slide presentation. 
He.80 described some of the 
tools scientists are using to 
explain quasars, black holes 
IftCI other mysterious space 

phenomena, to the 45 faculty, 
students, and staff who 
attended the lecture in the 
Chancellor's Conference 
Room. 

Smith used 10, a sateJlite of 
Jupiter, as one example of the 
tremendous activity occur· 
ring in our galaxy. Using a 
photograph from the recent 
Voyager mission, Smith 
presented 10, whose volcanic 
eruptions ... make Mt . 
St. Helens look like a cap 
pistol. 

Other slides showed the 
remnants of explos ions 
which have spewed out 
material and gases into the 

galaxy. Planetary nebula are 
~ examples of "the violent 
hiccup of a dying sun," as 
Smith described it. 

Smith's research concen· 
trates on quasi·stellar radio 
sources - quasars - which 
are found billions of light 
years from Earth. -

There are many unan· 
swered questions concernig 
quasars, said ' Smith. 
Scientists have neither been 
able to explain how quasars 
emit their tremendous 
amount of light in a small 
volume of space, nor how 
they give the appearance of 
expanding faster than the 

speed of light in violation of 
Einstein's theories. 

Smith discussed two 
possible. explanations for 
quasars. One is that quasars 
are the remains of exploded 
supernovas. Another expla· 
nation involves a massive 
black hole turning gravita' 
tional energy into other 
energy such as light. These 

po~sibi1ities are currently 
betng researched at CASSo 

CASS was created last fall 
and consists of UCSD faculty 
members from physics, 
chemistry, electrical 
engineering and computer 
science departments. This

research organization is 
under the direction of Dr. E. 
Margaret Burbidge. 

Smith described some of 
the tools CASS scientists are 
using and developing to 
explore the origins of the 
universe. One tool scheduled 
to begin operation in 1984 is a 
space te lescope to be 
launched by the US Space 
Shuttle. 

This "platform in space" 
has several advantages over 
Earth·based observatories. 
The earth's atmosphere 
blurs images and blocks the 
transmission of certain 
wavelengths of light. Since 
there is no atmosphere in 
space, "the space telescope 
lets us study new kinds of 
light and tells us more about 
the objects we are studying," 
said Smith, 

This telescope, in addition 
to havin~ a olanned gamma· 
ray observatory, willlXlntain 
many contr ibutions and 
instruments from CASS 
·scientis ts. 

One I'ropos al be ing 
developed by UC is a ten· 
meter telescope. In its initial 
planning and testing stages, 
th is 40 million doll a r 
telescope will have honey· 
combed mirrors at twice the 
diameter of the Mt. Palomar 
telescope. The project is 
tentatively scheduled for 
comoletion in 20 years and 
will probably be located in 
Hawaii . 

Th e "Ad ve nt ures in

federal sources said. 

Details of the t rans fer ,

the Oakland Calif. Tribune 
reported last week that 
Layton would be brought 
back to stand trial for

The FBI said Layton would 
be flown here today from 
Georgetown, Guyana, and 
would be arraigned in the

Elephant 'Man: 
Ultimate Freak 

The story of John Merrick 
BY LYNETTE TOM 

Staff Writer 

He was of average height, 
although a bowed back and 
twisted spine made him 
appear otherwise. His head 
was ballooned to twice its 
normal size by bulbuous 
tumors that covered his 
sku ll. More tumors sprouted 
in cauliflower·like bunches 
over his body. His right arm 
was a useless flipper , while 
his legs ended in knotted 
stumps. Only a perfectly 
formed left arm and genitals 
gave the slightest indication 
that he was a man. 

His name was John 
Merrick, but he's better 
known by the sideshow tag 
given to him by traveling 
tricksters: The Elephant 
Man. Merrick's metamor· 
phosis from a pathetic side· 
show attraction to a 
respected mem ber of London 
society because of the 
altruism of Sir Frederick 
Treves makes for a stunning 
potrait of mortal suffering 
and salvation in the film of 
the same name. 

"owner," Bytes, and 
disapproval from a hospital 
committee, the doctor houses 
the ailing elephant man in 
the isolation ward until a 
suitable home can be found . 
During his convalescence, 
Merrick demonstrates, to 
Treves ' amazement, that 
he's not an imbecile, but 
rather an intelligent man, 
capable of not only speaking 
and reading most eloquently, 
but also of emotions, even 
love. Havin~ shown his 
worth, he IS granted a 
permanent residence in the 
hospital. 

But the past continues to 
haunt Merrick. A scheming 
night porter has taken to 
showing · the curious a 
voyeur's peek at the elephant 
man.. . and the audIence IS 
Bytes himself. 

The script by Chistopher 
DeVore, Eric Bergren, and 
David Lynch keeps the 
viewer's attention firmly 
riveted to the screen with its

, 7 

John Hurt plays The ElePhant Man in the movie of the same name 

fascinating account of John 
Merrick who. with the 
assistance of Dr. Treves. was 
able to transcend the 
monstrous facade that 
encased him. 

Director Lynch's choice of 
black and white film and 
cinematographer Freddie 
Francis' use of an industrial 
revolution motif convey the 
feeling that the picture wa 
actually made in 1864, not 
1980. 

The editing by Anne V. 
Cooanes has an energy and 
texture not unlike t ha t of 
Dziga Vertok. while the 
music by John Morris is 
morose as it is moving. 

Anthony Hopkins is 
absolutely splendid as the 
humanitarianistic Dr. 
Treves. John Hurt's acting 
was confined to gestures and 
voice inflections because of 
heavy make·up. but his 
attempt is a bravaua 

portrayal 01 John Merrick. 
The two are followed by 
winning performances by 
Freddie Jones as Bytes, Sir 

John Gielgud as Charman I 
Carr Gomm. Dame Wendy ' 
Hiller as Heao Matron 
Mothershead. Michael 
Elphick as the night porter, 
and Anne Bancroft as actress 

Mad~e Kendal. 

The story begins when 
Treves, a surgeon at the 
London Hospital, discovers 
Merrick living in deplorable 
conditions and deterioratifl.ll:

Only a perfectly formed left arm and genitals

The film falters slightly in 
that it takes creative liberties 
with the actual facts of 
Merrick 's life. However, the 
picture is a ma£terful effort 
that neither exploits its 
protagonist. nor places him 
on a pedestal.

Negyesy,

Violin, .percuss·ion and 
dance combine for an 
unusual concert Wednesday, 
Oct. 29. 

Violinist, janos Negyesy, 
and the newly founded 
Chamber Dance Companr., 
directed by Manus Zirra, Will 
perform the premier of NOII1 
Miss! by Peter Eotvos, and a 
recreation of TJt. Choice 
adapted from VWIoslries 'e 
FWCllSSUnu, N~esy will be 
joined by oercussionists, 
Daryl Pratte,joel Bluestone. 
and jean-Charles Francois. 
<rg&n .. 

IleApite common belief that 
there is only one tradition, 
acoording to UCSD professor 
NeaYesy. the program will 
demonstrate that there is an 
organized system to 
contemporary music. 

"Listening with open 
e&n.J:...Neevesy claims, ' will 
devaup new sensitivity and 
understlllClin& so necessary 
for the maintenance of 
individual freedom." 

The Chamber Dance 
Company. as well as the 
IntematlOllal Sociey for Art 
Department, (which is 

cosponsoring the concert 
with the music dept) were 
founded by Negyesy, 
chore<lfP'apher, Marius Zirra, 
and pamterQuinn Mizer. It is 
decllcated to create and 
perform original works and 
to encourage joint endeavors 
among all artists in the 
community. 

sets for the production 
were designed by Maya 
Gingery, local artist who has 
exhibited her paintings in 

.Los Angeles, New York, and 
San Diego. Negyesy is noted 
as a brilliant interpreter of 
both classical and new music. 
In addition to his solo concert 
activities. he was concert 
master of the Berlin Radio 
Symphony Orchestra, and 
has recorded all Ives Sonatas 
for violin. 

Artistic director of the 
Chamber Dance Company, 
Marius Zirra was a leading 
dancer, later a director of 
Rumania's National Ballet 
Company. 

The performance is

She admits that she was cited for

"There are peorle who have

conversation shifts· back to her 
writing. Besides her book of 
restaurant reviews (Eating Out), she 
has published a novel and is now 
completing a work of non-fiction that 
she will say nothing about except, 
"It's a semi-sociological study of

Triton soccer goes strong 
as season progresses 

BY GILSAIDY 
UCSD played solid sO{'Cer 

Wednesday against I he

first half, but led only 1-00n a 
crossing pass set upbyTobin 
Sosnick to Norbert Kuhnerl. 
who headed the ball off the 
right crossbar into the net . 
Steady defense work by 
Steve Zuk kept USD from 
mounting much offense. 

In t he second hal f, the 
referee stole the show. Nearly 
every time the whistle blew, 
he flipped a min to decide the 
call. 

The coup de gras was 
midway in the half when a 

minor shoving match ensut'<l 
over an offside call. UeS)) 
halfback Greg Marston caml' 
in to break up any possibll' 
scuffle and got a punch 
thrown at him. The official 
gave Marston a red card 
(ejection notice) , and 
explained later that he had 
"seen a punch" - so, it was a 
50-50 chance it was Marslon.

Two UCSD Ruggers 
Play for all-:- stars 

BY DIRK VAN PEENAN 

Two UCSD rugby players 
combined to smre six point 
as the San Diego Under 23 
team lost t heir season opener 
Wednesday night, 22-14 to 
Tupaka of New Plymouth, 
New Zealand 

The Under 23 team is 
comjised of all-stars from 
loca colleges and c1u bs. 
Donny Elmajian, a Revelle 
sophomore, scoring on a 20-
yard end run, brought San 
Diego within two points of 
Tupaka following the New 
Zealander's early six-JXlint 
lead. 

A penalty kick in t he San 
Diego half led to a Tupaka 
field goal. but San DitgO 
came back quickly with 
another try and a jeff Jones 
ronversion to take t he lead . 
Jeff, a four·year veteran from 
UCSD. managed a poor field 

position, missing a penalty 
kick and themnversion from 
the 40· meter line. 

The second try put San 
Diego ahead 10-9, but they 
were unable to maintain the 
lead. Tupaka soored twice on 
kicks with their only try 
ooming late in the half. The 
conversion attempt was not 
~d.andthehalfended 19-10 
ID favor of Tupaka. 

The second half was more 
evenly balanced. San Diego 
allowed less New Zealand 
penetration and shook off I he 
penalties that had plagued 
them in the first half. The 
New Zealanders were again 
the first to soore. adding 
three more points to take a 
commanding 2'l·lO lead. The 
San Diego team fought back 
and scored their serond try 
late in the gamt'o 

get another shot on goal. 
Later in the half, tIll' 

referee gave the Tritons " 
penalty kick oftheir own. Rill 
Bullock, who dribbles and 
Pa'lses with ease, tied t 11(' 
game on t he kick high under 
t he cross bar. That ended I he 
scoring, but not I he 
oontroversy. at 2-2. 

The referee almost let the 
game get out of hand. Tre 
Conrique, coach of the UCSD 
team, did all he could. He 
went so far as to request I hal 
the official never work 
another UCSD game. 

The Tritons have a week 
off until next Friday when 
they play at La Verne College. 
They return home to Muir 
Field Saturday afternoon at 
noon to play Southern Cal 
College.

EDWARD WILLIAMS 

Juarez 
to leave 

continued from palEe 1 
won him the job. "What we 
are doing at UCSD (in urban 
and rural studies) is very 
closely related to what the 
oommission does ," he said. 

Juarez replaces Richard 
Ybarra. who resigned in 
August to resume his studies 
at Harvard UnivEl"sity. 

In leaving UCSD for the 
$25,000 a year position, 
Juarez makes it clear he is not 
simply "abandonings hip. " "I 
think the program needs the 
kind of assistance I have 
provided," he said; though he 
realizes the program also 
needs a full-time supervisor 
for field studies. Juarez said. 
Dr. Charles Thomas, head of 
the program, will decide 
what to do with his position 
at the end of the Quarter. 

Radiation 
continu.ed from page 2 

Iodine-131, which is most 
dangerous in t his situation." 

Dr. Thomas Mancuso. an 
ex pert and government 
consultant on low-level 
radiation at the Graduate 
School of Public Health at the 
University of Pitts burgh. 
also reacted angrily to the 
handiling of the Sept. 25 leak . 
"Government representa-
tives have issued misleading 
statements relative to 
radiation leaks an d the 
monitoring of those leaks," 
he said. "In the process of 
misleading the pu b1ic, they 
have lessened their own 
cred i bili ty _ " 

According to oongressional 
testimony of DOE officials. 
40 nuclear test explosions 
have resulted in off-site 
radiation since the testing 
program went underground 
m Nevada 18 years ago. 
Nuclear devices are being 
detonated at the site on an 
average of once every three 
weeks this year, slightly up 
from last year. 

A report released August 6 
by the House Subrommittee 
on Oversight and Investiga-
tion revealed that the 
government has intentional-
ly oovered up information 
revtaling pu blic healt h 
damage from test site 
radiation in t he past. Medieal 
studies have demonstrated 
increased rates of leukemia 
and thyroid canar in regions 
downwind from the test site. 

Preston ]. Truman, 
director of the Utah-citizens' 
~p Citizens Call, said: 
'Knowing DOE's past 

performance, they were 
waitin._ the (Sept. 25) !elk 
to diapne before reportinl 
it. It's. COIlVSliSlt way DOl 
to ad ~ with. leak if 
you don't havemoniton 00."

SACRAMENTO - The 
state Board of Educat ion 
heard a University of 
California chemistry teacher 
yesterday with a familiar 
oomplaint - many of her 
first-year students got litt Ie 
preparation or counseling in 
high choo!. 

The teacher. Mare 
Taagepera. a lecturer at UC 
Irvine , said she got 
discouraging remIts fmm 

in~erviews over four years 
WIt h 600 students in 
beginning chemistry course; 
for science ml\iors who can't 
handle the regular firsl ·year 
chemistryu class. 

"More than half of I hem 
told me that they had simply 
been wasting time in high 
school," she said in an 
interview. "Half of my 
students had had no guidanc£ 
from anyone in choosing 
classes in high school." 

Several board mem bers 
who have contended 
California students aren'l 
taking enough diffi cult 
oo~.Jrses in high school got 
remfon:ement for thaI view 
from Ms. Taagepera. who 
said she had s tudied her 
stu dent s' high chool 
preparation.
