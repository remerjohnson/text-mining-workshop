In a four to one vote Wednesday, 
the UCSD elections board decided 
to postpone the student govern-
ment referendum until the ninth 
week. 

nesday, Thursday, and Friday, 
March 7,8, and 9.

Studeot Panel 
Participation 

According to the Board, the 
referendum was postponed in 
order to give the students more 
time to become familiar with the 
three forms of student government 
to be offered. Students will also 
have a chance to inititate their own 
discussions about the issues. 

The motion was passed easily 
and stood as a compromise bet-
ween the previous date of the 
eighth week and a postponment 
until the spring quarter. 

Council Says Halt Campus Bike Sales 

U~D Academic Senate (AS) 
members will decide next week 
whether student participation on 
senate conunittees should be 
formalized. 

The senate - which claims all 
U~D faculty as voting members-
will pass judgement on a recom-
mendation from its Executive and 
Policy Conunittee that students be 
allowed mePlbership on 11 of 20 AS 
committees. 

Currently, students sit "in-
formally" on six senate panels, 
according to Mark Fingerman, the 
Student Cooperative Union's 
Appointments and Evaluations 
committee coordinator. 

The senate is set to vote ' on the 
proposal next Tuesday afternoon 
at 3: 00 in the HL Auditorium. 

Z8 Observers ADowed 
AS meetings are closed to the 

general public, but 28 "observers" 
are allowed to sit in on every 
meeting, senate administrative 
assfstant Lynn Harris said Wed-
nesday. She added that the open 
slots will be filled on a first-come, 
first-serve basis. 

None of the observers are 
allowed speaking privileges during 
senate meetings. However, three 
students, two undergraduates and 
one grad student, are aDowed to 
contribute to discussion, according 
to Harris. 

The two undergraduates - ap-
pointed by the Coop - are Pat 
Bloomer and Steven Mudd. The 
grad student, who was . appointed 
by the Graduate Student Council, is

The referendum will contain two 
parts: one which concerns the 
undergraduate student govern-
ment, offers three models for 
consideration: ' Student 
Cooperative Union, a new 
associated Students model 
(ASUCSD) and the Undergraduate 
Student Government, or 
Cabinet! Assembly. The second 
part consists of thirty-nine 
questions for students to consider, 
concerning academic freedom, 
admissions policies and other 
student-related areas. 

All four colleges have scheduled 
activities in which students can 
find out about and discuss the 
election issues. A voter handbook 
is being printed that contains in-
formation about the three models 
of government and the questions. 

Special Rule 
The second part of the 

referendum, the Coop's Com-
prehensive Student Question 
Petition, was put on the ballot amid 
a controversy over its legitimacy. 
A portion of the board fel't that the 
questions had been allowed onto 
the ballot through a special rule 
change. 

Proponents felt the questions 
should appear due to their im-
portance and the student support 
the questions had received. The 
Board had first voted to reject the 
questions, then reversed its 
decision and allowed the questions 
to appear. 

The Board also discussed the 
question of campaign funds during 
Wednesday's meeting. Althc;>ugh no 
motion was passed, the Board 
discussed requesting funds from 
the Student Activities Fee Support 
Group (SAF). Equal amount would 
go to each of the three models. 

At SCAR Rally WElt nESjay I

The San Diego City Council voted 
Wednesday ti> recommend the 
UCSD Bike Shop halt the sale of 
bicycles. 

The council voted a-4 on an 
amendment offered by Mayor 
Wilson to urge the Bike Shop retail 
sales activity stop but remain for 

s~udents to use in repairing their 
own bikes. 

The vote, as City Attorney John 
Witt said during the session is only 
advisory. 

Wilson's amendment superseded 
a resolution passed by the council's 
rules committee which would h8Â¥e 
urged complete closure of the shop, 
and directed the city's Sacramento 
lobbyist to work with the state 
Legislature to delete any state 
Bike Shop funds from the budget. 

"I:;ook like Fools" 
According to student affairs 

dean George Murphy-who ap-
peared before the council-the 
clause concerning state funds "just 
ma<Je the council members look 
like fools" because the Bike Shop is 
not state-funded at all. 

Although the vote has no legal 
standing with UC, Murphy views it 
only as "a breather." The council 
will now send a letter to the Board 
of Regents, "which won't be 
ignored," he said. 

The council took action on the 
Bike Shop because several com-
munity bicy Ie store owners feel 
the shop offers direct and unfair 
competition, as it operates on state 
land and is, according to the 
owners, supported by tax dollars. 

The council ruling followed two 
hours of spirited debate over such 
topics as Bike Shop funding and 
revenue, the ramifications of 

Bakke D.ecision Termed . "Racist Act'.' 
by DaD St. CIaJre Bacon 

Staff Writer 

On Sept. 16, 1978 the California 
State Supreme Court ruled that 
special admissions programs 
were illegal because they In-
stituted a form of reverse 
discrimination. The ruling came 
out of a case where Allan Bakke, 
a white male, charged he was 
discriminated against because he 
was 'refused admittance to UC 
Davis medical school while other 

,"less qualified" minority ap-

plicants were admitted. 
In the wake of the Regents' 

decision to appeal the case to the 
Supreme Court, 130 people 
gathered Wednesday in front of 
the gym steps to rally against the 
Bakke decision. Sponsored by the 
Student Coalition Against 
Racism (SCAR), a nationwide 
organization with a UCSD 
chapter, the rally featured ten 
speakers representing on and off-
campus organizations, who spoke 
out against the Bakke decision. 

Many of the speak~ equated 

the Bakke decision with racism. 
Antonio Torres of SCAR noted 
That "the Bakke deCision reflects 
a racist act in which racism 
breeds oppression and conflict, 
oppression and hatred, op-
pression and struggle and more 
oppression. " 

Greg Akili of NIA Cultural 
Organization enumerated on the 
concept of racism, defining it as 
"the culture of denial based 
exclusively upon race." He said 
that there are "three parts of 
racism: ideology, imposition and 
institutional arrangement, the 
latter of which exists in 
America." 

Several speakers noted what 
they termed the necessity of 
affinnative action because of 
injustices in the past, claiming, 
like RoMette Youmans of the 
Feminist Coalition, that, "We 
have a rig~ to a special ad-
missions program." Charles Fox 
ci the Intercollegiate Black 
Student Coalition backed up this 

. point by noting the racial 
~ discrimination that permeated 
~ the past, and the need for special 
~ admissions programs.

reconunendine closure of the shop 
and whe.ther bicycles are a luxury 
or necessity. 

Murphy-who headed the small 
UCSD delegation-told the council, 
"Not one single state-budget dollar 
in any fashion has any impact on 
the Bike Shop. " The shop is 
completely funded by its revenue 
and Student Center Fee-money, the 
dean said. 

In response, Jeff Palley, 
representing the S'anta Barbara 
Bike Dealers Association, said 
Murphy's, assertion made him 
"wonder what kind of fools the 
UCSD administrators take us 
for?" 

Cloud the Issue? 
Another community bike store 

owner, Robin Basham, of the 
Southern California Bike Dealers 
Association, said U~D has been 
"trying desperately to cloud the 
issue" by starting to charge rent to 
the Bike Shop and limiting shop 
sales to students. 

(Actually, Bike Shop sales, 
limited last week to students, 
have been expanded to include 
staff and faculty . Murphy, who 
made both Bike Shop recom-
mendations to Chancellor 
McElroy, said he " made a 
mistake" the first time. ) 

Neither mea~ure matters, 
Basham said, because the UCSD 
shop is still unfair competition for 
community bike dealers. The Bike 
Shop should be limited to informal 
repair work, he said. 

Murphy answered this by saying 
services like the Bike Shop are part 
of an attempt to provide services 
not provided by private business, 
which looks on UCSD as an "un-
viable economic entity." 

Murphy and Basham also 
clashed over Bike Shop revenue. 
Murphy claimed $27,000 is the top 
annual revenue generated by the 
shop. 

On the other hand, Basham 
estimated the top figure at 

UCSO 's Councilman Gil Johnson 
ooted against the Bike Shop 
We dnesda y , 
$100,000, and charged that "no 
legitimate business statement" of 

. Bike Shop revenues has ever been 
made. 

RamHications Involved 
Council members opposing the 

measure expressed much concern 
about the ramifications of 
recommending closure for the 
shop. UCSD student Steve Coleman 
told the council that , under 
arguments advanced by the bike 
dealers, the council should also 
suggest closure for the campus 
cafeterias, the Revelle Sundry 
Store, the Bookstore, the weekend 
movies and the various cultural 
events, since they serve no strict 
educational need and also cater to 
the general public. 

Councilman Floyd Morrow, who 
voted against Wilson's amend-
ment, said he would be "interested 
to see what the distinction between 
the Bike Shop and other non-
educational campus entities is." 

Councilmembers Leon William 
and Jess Haro, also opponents of 
the resolution, asked whether other 
campus services have drawn 
opposition from the community. 

"Do the doctors complain about 
the student health program?" 
Williams asked.

Disabled Persons Awareness 
Week Set to Start Tuesday 

by Kathy McMillen 

And so we have another Awareness Week at UCSD. What is it this time, 
sexual, political, radical, or educational? Actually, it seems a little bit of 
everything is being planned for the upcoming Disabled Persons 
Awareness Week, happening next Tues. through Fri. 

According to Disa bled Student Services (DSS) Coordinator Brad Graff, 
the purpose of the awareness week is "to allow the university population 
the chance to discover the social, academic and personal problems a 
disabled person experiences everyday." 

To experience a "disability simulation," Graff encourages people to 
"take up" a wheelchair or eye patches and a white cane "f~r however 
long you'a like." "We hope a person will realisticaDy e~pefle~ce what 
it's like to be in a wheelchair or be blind through these sunulallons," he 
said. You'D learn what it's like to be confined in a wheelchair, having to 
go from class to class. It's hard not to cheat and get up." 

Graff hopes that these simulations will raise questions such as, "How 
would this effect my dating, my studying, and my daily life?" After going 
through some of the frustrations a disability brings, "If people ask 
themselves these questions, then we have succeeded," said Graff. 

LettbtI tbe a~ec" bow 
Graff noted that those participating ir the awareness week can assist 

aD disabled students by letting archittcts and engineers know about 
potentially unmaneuverable situations around campus. Graff said 
pointedly, "We are just now at mi.nlmum accessibility. People can sur-
vive without kilJ,ing themselves." 

One important feature perttneJ'lt tn nfOrt ". ~ deats wiU! early 
enrollment for people with severe disabilities. The DSS, since its for-
mation, has been seeking this end. Packets must be handed into Graff by 
2 pm Thurs. Further infonnation can be gained by callin~.:xt 3967. 

Along with the simulations which wiD be going on all week, thel C will be 
two showings of One Flew Oftr tile C8ekoo'. Nest Tues. evening. 
Additionally, there will be a wheelchair sports demonstration on Revelle

there it states that one of the o~

"Assessment of dangers before

You say "such a moratorium

Stanford's Paul Berg want us to

all scientists, what fear is there

consider such a thing.

Can Scientists Be Contained ? 
The debate about recombinant DNA research 

rages on, at times digre'ssing into irrelevance, 
which obscures the real- and far-reaching - issue. 
Such irrelevance was addressed by Harold J. Simon 
in his letter (Triton Times, Feb. 9) . 

First, his snide conunent that Citizens for Safe 
Research (CC;R) would more appropriately be 
called "Citizens to Stop Research" ignores the fact 
that the group is constituted of many scientists who 
are themselves advocates of science research but 
who feel that the implications of that research must 
be taken into account. 

The analogy made by either Simon or Clifford 
Grobstein, during the debate on Feb. 5, between 
applying limits to recombinant DNA research and 
totalitarianism is utterly fallacious; the absurdity 
of such an analogy is apparent when one considers 
the same argument applied to traffic laws: Is such 
control "totalitarian?" Those who wave this red 
flag should learn to distinguish between fascism 
and collective decision taken in the interest of 
society. 

Furthermore, the question about whether con-
trols on this research would drive it underground 
was discussed during the debate. As one panel 
member pointed out, most scientists engage in work 
the end-product of which will be a publishable 
paper. H the research had to be carried out " un-
derground," one could argue that the motivation to 
do it would disappear (except in cases similar to 
government-sponsored research un germ warfare: 
shall we make this analogy?) 

This last issue of motivation brings us to another 
important consideration: there are many biology 
undergraduates and graduate students at uam 
who favor this research. 

Whv? 

These are the people who should be most aware 
of the potential hazards; if they have worked with 
radioactivity, they should be aware of the manifest 
hazards, the im~ibility of containment. These 
same inititates, however, plan careers in biology: 
any curtsilment of research - of any kind - is 
perceived as a decrease in the number of jobs and, 
simultaneously, a decrease in the opportunities to 
"make a name" on this new frontier. 

Simon himself is far frol'fl "disinterested" (which 
he claims to be;) as he reminds us when he signs his 
letter, he is " M.D, Ph.D. Professor of Community 
Medicine," credentials which are intended to awe 
us into acceptance of his "expert" opinion. He is, on 
the contrary, a member of that sector of the 
"science culture" which so often loses sight of C,P. 
Snow's other culture - the humanities, from the 
Latin 'humanitas,' human : people. 

Simon's final .comment is the epitome of 
irrelevance: in what is an empty, formalistic 
criticism, he castigates CSR for signing their open 
letter to Dr. Henderson (chairperson of the Chan-
cellor's Special Biohazards Committee) as 
"Citizens for Safe Research." This sort of objection 
focuses attention on the form of CSR's comments 
and away from its important content. The group is 
hardly "anonymous"; it is composed of real, 
distinct individuals and, furthermore, represents 
many more people than its membership. 

It represents those of us (I am not a member 
myself) who feel that " the ultimate question is not 
whether some bacteria can be contained in special 
laboratories, but whether scientists can be con-
tained in an ordinary society" (p. 62, Atlantic 
Monthly, Febiuary. 1977.)

Power Abused by Coop 
If what r witnessed at the Student Cooperative meeting on Feb. 7 is any 

indication of how this body is 'representing the students: then the only 
regret r have about the upcoming referendum election is that It hasn't 
happened much sooner than now. . 

I was absolutely appalled at the way certain 'powerful' people not only 
tried to dOltUnate the meeting, but blatently caned the 'paupers' at the 
meeting incompetent. The students who were at this meeting were there 
because they were concerned about something - and if this is the only 
reason they were there, it should have been enough for the regulars at the 
meeting; as a maiter of fact, they should have been delig~ed that there 
were students who cared enough about an issue to come and support their 
cause, 

Instead of being welcomed, however, we were laughed at and ridiculed 
because we happened to disagree with the 'gods' who 'run' the Coop. 

If this wasn't enough to get me upset, I was called a 'robot' in the 'l'riton 
Times on Feb. 11, in an 'Open letter to the UC;O Community' by these 
same 'gods.' This letter claimed that I and people at the meeting were 
"misled (in order to) attempt a railroad ofthe Cooperative." 

Who are these people to call me an idiot?! Iwasat that meeting because 
I was concerned, as a student. I knew perfectly well what I was doing, and 
I was doing it because I thought it was coPl'ect - no one brainwashed me 
mto domg anythmg. 

From what I saw at this meeting, I would suggest that the power-
hungry people who think that they run the Coop, and who wrote the letter 
to the Triton Times needte> consider the needs of the students. If the only 
way that someone like Mark Fingerman can solve his problems is to 
threaten to punch me out at the end of the meeting, then I don't think he 
deserves the privilege of holding any kind of authoritative position. I 
certsinly don't want someone like that representing me. 

Mter reading the letter in the Triton Times, I beganÂ·to realize that the 
people who wrote this letter still don't realize what we wanted. I don't 
think that there was anyone at the meeting who dfdn't want the Com-
prehensive Referendum Petition on the ballot. The complaint was in the 
way it was put on the ballot. 

There is absolutely no way that anyone could have gotten anything on 
the ballot without following the guidelines that the Elections Board set 
down, and why should an exception be made for the Coop? 

Mter looking through this Petition, I. now realize why the group who 
wrote the questions wanted it pushed through wltbo" expuimUig tne 
questions - there seems to be some key questions spread throughoUt the

Have you notlced the eart~ 
moving going on just north of the 
La Jolla Village Apartments, along 
Gilman Drive? This past Monday, 
February 14, I discovered that next 
week the asphalt shoulder which so 
many of us Use each day as we 
walk or ride our bicycles to school 
along Gilman Drive will be 
removed. 

The city has granted permission 
for an "improvement to the road." 
It will be widened to provide space 
for parking, as was done in front of 
the apartment complex. 

The problem is ihat this leaves 
those of us who do not use cars to 
get to school three equally un-
pleasant alternatives: 1) We may 
continue to go up Gilman Drive on 
the right side of the outside lane, 
thereby putting ourselves in the 
path of speeding cars (the speed 
limit Is 50 mph); 

2) We may cross Gilman Drive 
and travel against traffic on the 
west side, sandwiched between 
parked and moving cars, a perilous 
maneuver, especially at the mouth 
of the La Jolla Village Drive ramp: 

3) We may go up VlUa La JoUa 
Drive and then down to La Jolla 
Village Drive (by the Gulf station), 
where I am told It Is impossible for 
a cyclist to trigger the left-turn 
signal. We reach school either via 
the VA hospital, or by fonowlng La 

Jolla Villag~ Drive West. This 
third alternl\tive requires sub-
stantially greater time, distance 
and effort than the Gilman route. 

Riding or walking to school 
benefits the UCSD community in 
many ways: It saves parking 
spaces, it reduces pollution; it 
lowers gasoline consumption and it 
is pleasurable and healthy. Many 
of us use the Gilman Drive 
shoulders - especially since the 
city built the Rose Canyon Bike 
Path this summer - although we 
own cars, and pay the taxes and 
(ees which help subsidize road 

construction. 
It is primarily the University 

community which uses this section 
of Gilman Drive. I suggest that, 
until the improvement is c0m-
pleted, the northbound speed llmit 
be substantially lowered. 

Closing one lane for pedestrian 
and bicycle traffic would be the 
safest alternative. 

The city will not do either unless 
we ask. If you share my concern, 
contact yOUI' city councilman at 
once: in La Jolla, Gil Johnson; in 
Pacific Beach, Tom Gade.

"Fun with Dick and Jane" 
- . 

Cute Kids Grow Up and Raise Hell 
Remember DIck and Jane frem 

sexist grade scbool primers? If the 
storY were continued, Dick would 
probably grow up to be a smart and 
successful breadwinner and Jane, 
the pretty and devoted housewife. 
No doubt they would Uve happily in 
a big house with a kld named Billy 
and a dog named Spot - shining 
eiamples of the American dream. 

But what might the happy family 

do if disaster struck? Ted Kot-
cheff's Full With DI~ ~ J~e. 
comically explores thIS situation. 
Dick Harper is fired from his job as 
an aerospace executive, so the 
Harpers face enormous cutbacks: 
the remodelling of the house must 
stop and so must construction of 
the swimming pool: ind90r as well 
as outdoor plants are repossessed, 
there will be no more imported 
French wines for Dick and no more 
ski lessons for Billy, and Jane must 
give up the Book-Qf-the-Month 
Club. . 

But Dick (George Segal) and 
Jane (Jane Fonda) are just not cut 
out for a declasse life of skimping. 
They give it a shotfor awhile: Dick 
stands in line at the unemployment 
office in a three piece suit while 
Jane (despite Dick's con-
descension - "What could you 
possibly do?" ) finds a job 
modeling clothes. And yet, 
somehow the couple manages to 
bungle every attempt to-get ahead, 
so they resortÂ· to stealing to gain 

back their sorely missed white-
collar lifestyle. 

The film has a lot of comic 
potential, but unfortunately never 
really develops it successfully. It Is 
presented in a generaUy witless 
manner. The scenes are cheaply 
put together and resemble 
segments from TV sit~ma such 
as "~lIed." Director Kotcheff 
often resorts to cheap humor, 
bu{dening the film with as many 
gags and jokes as possible, no 
matter how tasteless or pointless. 

Fonda using the toilet , paper and 
all, while conversing with hubby 
Segal and jokes centered around 
the phallus just don't make it. 

Is the movie a satire on Dick and 
Jane stereotypes? A comic social 
commeniary? Or maybe just a 
forum for burlesque gags and 
cheap jokes? The director didn't 
seem to know, as the movie 
flounders from one weak situation 
to another with no apparent 
direction. Fonda and Segal seem to 
be the only saving graces of Fun 
With Dicit and Jane, making do 
with crummy lines and adding 
some class to a tacky production. 

Their roles as cardboard, fairy 
tale figures committing blue collar 
crimes are somewhat entertaining. 
You never really get the idea that 
they're doing anything terribly 
wrong hecause it's passed off as 
good clean fun - nobody gets hurt, 
nobody gets caught. Jane even 
says "Gee, I'm sorry" to the motel 
clerk, and when a guy jumps on the 
hood of their car to apprehend

the crowning glory is when they rip

. argued that the death penalty is not 
a deterrent to murder and cited 
statistics in states with and without 
death penalty showing, at best, less 
murders in states without the 
death penalty. 

He outlined the three classes of 
murder which include crimes of 
passion, premeditated murder and 
psychopathic murder, pointing out 
that each class cannot be 
prevented with the threat of a 
death penalty . 

"You come down to the point that 
the system can and does make 
mistakes, " Boomer said, and 
ironically added that we will have 
many problems in compensating 
the innocent person who has been 
convicted of a capital crime and 
executed. 

Boomer e:s:plained that the idea 
of execution, as witnessed by the 
recent Gary Gilmore fiasco 
promotes more capital crimes. ' 

"Execution promotes the idea 
that violence in our society is 
justified," Boomer said, and added 
that this "creates an atmosphere 
which instigates violence."
