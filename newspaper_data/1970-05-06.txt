Separate meetings of faculty 

and students discussed war re-
search and tactics to protest U.S. 
involvement inlndochina. The (ac-
ulty voted in an official afternoon 
meeting for a "class morator-
ium," but withheld action pending 
next Tuesday's Academic Senate 
meeting. The action followed a 
request by Chancellor McGill for 
an "imaginative response" to end 
the escalation of tactics that might 
end in violence and, as in Kent, 
OhiO, in death. 

About 50 faculty members con-
vened in USB 2722 yesterday af-
ternoon to hear proposals from 
the biology department and others. 

Abl)ut 600 students out of 
800 meeting in Revelle cafeteria 
i:<:,t night called a student strike 
extending to Friday, May 8. 

The meeting began with seve-
ral speakers denouncing U.S. in-
volvement in Cambodia and the 
deaths of four students at Kent 
State. Andy Fineberger said that 
"democracy is incompatible with 

EDrroRIAL 
The time has come for all of 

us to reevaluate our relationships 
with those forces that affect our 
lives-the government, the uni-
versity, and even ourselves. 

Our government has decided to 
compound its tragically immoral 
policies by expanding the Asian 
war to yet another country. This 
move is made all the more hypo-
critical coming on the heels of 
Nixon's de-escalation statements. 

Gov. Reagan has seized another 
opportunity for political opportun-
ism by closing down the univer-
sity before it can be shut down. 
That 's like quitting before you're 
fired. 

Our university has failed to 
come to grips with the implica-
tions of its increasing entangle-
ment with governmental agencies. 
It becomes clear that even if 
much of the Defense Department 
funded research could not tech-
nically be classified as "war re-
search," the university has al-
lowed itself to be put in a posi-
tion of dependency. 

Our faculty has been shameful-
ly lax. If they would really make 
a meaningful move, a large part 
of the stud~nt body would be pre-
pared to back them up, foregOing 
other direct actions. 

the war." Byron King stated 
that "Students want to do some-
thing more than demonstrations .•. 
we did the sit-in to harass those 
professors with DOD contracts." 
Another student referred to the 
"Kent massacre, which has shonw 
how the ruling groups in this 
country operate." 

A general discussion of the 
strike itself followed and cen-
tered on tactics. One speaker 
called for "a sit-in again Thurs-
day to pressure the administra-
tion to end war reseal ch." He 
added that "the demonstrators 
sitting in should use whatever 
force necessary to achieve thier 
mission." Another disagreed: 
"If we sit in a building the po-
lice will come ••• there is an al-
ternative ..•• Don't play into Rea-
gan's hands." He added that "If 
police come un campus, we'll all 
be involved, not just those sitting 
in." Perhaps the most controver-
sial speaker of the evening was a 
student who said, "Chanting andl 
clapping is a fascist tactic ••.• Fas-

Our administration thus far has 
reacted only to the manifestations 
of protest and not the issues being 
protested. 

The students who have partici-
pated in protest actions have suc-
ceeded in bringing issues before 
the university community. Butwe 
all know what will happen in the 
event of one more sit-in. With 
bo~h sides committed to action a 
scenario.is set to unfold, and on-
ce the police are on campus, any 
chance for negotiation on issues 
is lost. We, the students, must 
continue to apply pressure, but 
must also insure that the most 
creative and effective tactics are 
being used at all times. 

The next concrete move that 
can be made will probably come 
at the next Academic Senate me-
ting. If there is to remain any 
chance of the universitycommun-
ily to work together" it hinges on 
the faculty h'.' .ating an immed-
iate investigation of all research 
grants with the goal of eliminat-
ing war-related activities. 

Furthermore, they must lead 
the community in responding to 
the outrageous acts of the United 
States government. If there is 
any respect left in this country for 
"intellectuals" then this is their 
chance to act with responsibility. 

cism is a s tate of mind ••.. It's 
not a government monopoly." Al-
most shouted off the stage, this 
speaker received a standing ova-
tion from about half of those at-
tending. 

About 10 p.m. the first resolu-
tion was passed calling for s tu-
dent support of a work stoppage 
by UCSD employees "as the only 
effective way to stop war re-
search. If The second resolution 
called for a "boycott of classes 
with participants ' energy directed 
towards work-stoppage support 
rather than class disruption or 
personal intimidation." A final 
resolution set the length of the 
strike at three days, till May 8th, 
when further acion will be con-
sidered. 

Prof. Cohen suggested at the 
faculty's meeting that it was neces 
sary to insure the rights of those 
who did not want to stop business 
Dr. Carlos Blanco rose to qualify 
this point, saying that those who 
do hold classes would be protect-
ed, " but who will protect those 
who do do not?" He referred to 
Regents' rules that forbid faculty 
from cancelling classes under 
such circumstances. 

After it was pointed out that 
department chairmen could pro-
tect striking faculty by refusing 
to report classes as cancelled, 
the debate centered on the ques-
tion of war research,

The meeting ended atter a de-
bate between Prof. Sheldon Shultz 
and Francis Halpern over the 
allged "time lag" between the 
point at which research is com-
pleted and it can be applied. 

The meeting was billed as an 
"unofficial caucas " of the faculty 
and no official action was taken. 
But the members present did en-
dorse the resolution of the Biol-
ogy department, which had stopped 
all normal activity-- inc luding re-
search and classroom meetings. 

Biology on Strike 
Following the lead of other 

colleges throughout the nation, 
UCSD's Biology Department yes-
terday unanimously passed a 
resolution to send a delegation 
to Washington demanding an end 
to the war in Southeast Asia. 

They will carry a petition 
addressed to the President, the 
Senate, and the House of Rep-
rrsentatives, which protests the 
recent escalation of violence in 
Southeast Asia and on univerSity 
campus. According to Profes-
sor Soule, the petition won't be 
worded strongly enough for some, 
but will be too strong for others. 
He felt this was desirable in 
order to get mass support. 

Soule referred to a recent 
Gallup Poll showing over 50% 
However, he said, "This won't 
change NlXon's mind on the war. 
It's dOing what others do ... public 
relations politics." He added 
it would be impressive to the 
outside community if students 
and faculty get together to raise 
money for a political purpose. 
He pOinted to the potential na-
tional publicity of a delegation 
demanding a White House au-
dience, " ... especially when the 
President refuses to see us." 

The petition curr ntly circu-
lating on campus asks for con-
tributions, which can be given to 
Mike Soule in 2238 Bonner Hall. 
Checks can be made out to the 
.. UCSD Washington Delegation." 

Tentative plans calls for a dele-
gation of three students and three 
faculty. Soule expressed opti-
mism that a meeting of depart-
ment heads scheduled for 2 p.m. 
Friday would give Its support 
to the resolution and Join in the 
effort to obtain signatures and 
raise money. 

Notice 
Muir students are to meet east 

of Building 2A at 9p, m. tonight to 
discuss the issue of war research 
on campus.
