RIVERSIDE - UC Riverside 
administrators are considering 
a proposal to build an on-
campus indoor sports arena, 
which would house basketball 
games and various concerts 
and events. If approved, 
construction on the arena 
could .be.sin within the year, 
campus officials said. Admin-
istrators are currently conduct-
ing a feasibility study on a 
proposed 12,OOO-seat arena. 
"The study is looking at the 
gap between the income it 
should produce and the cost it 
would incur, and if that gap is 
acceptable enough for public 
support to handle it," said Jon 
Hutchinson, UCR director of 
real estate and development.

Seizure Damage 
Can Be UmHed 
SAN FRANCISCO -
Children who receive drug 
treatments to combat the ill 
effects of epileptic seizures 
before they arrive at the 
hospital have a lesser chance 
of suffering brain damage, 
according to a recent study by 
UCSF researchers. Scientists 
said early medical treatment 
cut the average seizure time in 
half and also limited the 
number of recurring seizures. 
"Pre-hospital therapy makes it 
less likely a child or adult will 
have permanent medical or 
neurological damage as a 
result of status epi lepticus," 
said chief author of the report, 
Brian Alldredge.

UCSD'S academic

ranking -Is it all it's 
cracked up to be? 

T THE END OF EVERY COLLEGE BASKETBALL 
season comes one of the most important rituals 
in sports. 

After examining the overall record, the 
level of competition encountered and other 
factors, a National Collegiate Athletic 
Association (NCAA) committee meets 
behind closed doors to rank basketball 
teams for the tournament. 

The release of those final rankings is big 
news - they are reported on the first page 
of most major newspapers. A few weeks 
after the tournament champion is 
crowned, however, those college 
rankings are almost completely forgot- . 
ten. 

But there is another set of rankings 
which colleges and universities 
must bow to for the entire year -
rankings that have nothing to do 

with college sports. 
Six people at U.S. News and World Report, 

working all year behind closed doors, concern 
themselves with academic rankings. Every 
Fall, they publish the" America's Best Col-
leges" issue, the nation's best-known guide to 
the top universities in the country.

Graduate 
Employees 
To WalkOut 
Wednesday 
UNION: UCSD administration 
denies student demands for 
collective bargaining rights 
By Ben Elgin 
Associate News Editor 

As negotiations for student union recogni-
tion remain deadlocked, the Association of Stu-
dent Employees (ASE) is expected to announce 
today a'two-day work-stoppage on Wednesday 
and Thursday. 

ASE members believe that over 500 teaching 
and research assistants, tutors, readers and act-
ing instructors will participate in the strike. 

According to ASE Executive Board member 
Anthony Navarrete, the purpose of the strike is 
to demonstrate the union's determination to 
gain collective bargaining rights. 

"It will show the administration there's a 
significant amount of academic employees who 
are serious about having a union and collective 
bargaining," said Navarrete. "We are certainly ... 
prepared to continue to struggle and fight for 
recognition. " 

Navarrete said he is confident the strike will 
prove to the university the value of student 
employees'services. 

"I hope it will have a great deal of effect," he 
said. "It will show the undergraduates that there 
are actually employees there ... who read their 
papers and give them grades." 

ASE plans to establish a picket line at the 
Muir entrance on Torrey Pines Road. 

The ASE and the administration are cur-
rently involved in a legal hearing held by the 
California Public Employee Relations Board 
(PERB) to determine whether collective bar-
gaining power should be granted to student 
employees. 

According to Vice Chancellor Richard 
Attiyeh, a strike during the hearings would be 
detrimental to the entire legal process. 

"To have a walk-out in the middle of the 
[PERB] hearing seems inappropriate to us," 
said Attiyeh. 

"It is undesirable because it will interfere 
with the undergraduate experience and deprive 
them of the opportunity to learn in a lab section 
or a discussion section," Attiyeh added. 

The pending strike gained momentum two 
weeKs ago when ASE members voted over-

UCSD Celebrates Earth Day's 25th with Music, Speakers 
ANNIVERSARY: Some 
fear activist spirit was 
lost in festivities 
By M..,. Pal 
Staff Writer 

UCSD students celebrated Earth 
Day's 25th anniversary last Friday at 
an all-day festival at the Hump, orga-
nized by the Student Environmental 
Action Coalition (SEAC) and 
CALPIRG. 

The festivities, which included a 

wide range of bands and speakers, 
were designed to increase public 
awareness of environmental issues in 
an enjoyable environment. 

"We wanted to educate and teach 
the people how to respect the earth, 
while having fun and just hanging 
ou~" said SEAC member Satu Larson. 

This year's Earth Day celebration 
brought out many local bands, ven-
dors and organizations such as 
Greenpeace and the Siem Club. In 
addition, students listened to lectures 
on everything from ceo-feminism to 

environmental justice. 
Although organizers of the event 

said they tried to capture the essence 
of Earth Day, some students felt that 
SEAC and CALPIRG strayed from 
Earth Day's orginal message of envi-
ronmental activism. 

"Earth Day is supposed to be 
awareness about the earth," said Muir 
senior Brent Turner. "I don't think 
it's very educational anymore. It's a 
great celebration, but I don't think 
we're here only to dance around and

Women Seek Greater

By HeatWMcR ..

Women representing nations 
from around the world gathered at 
UCSD Thunday night for a discus-
sion entitled, "Women and Politics, 
Reforming the United Nations." 

Nguyen, a UCSD undergraduate stu-
dent from Vietnam, and Irina 
yuzhakova, a Department of Inter-
national Relations fellow from Rus-
sia.

Discussing the role of females in

keynote speaker. 

UCSD students 
from Vietnam, Yu-
goslavia and Russia 
also participated in 
a panel discussion at 
Thursday's lecture, 
the third in an ongo-
ing International 
Perspectives series. 

Galey stressed 
the need to reform 
U.N. politics, policy 
and the degree to 
which national gov-
ernments enforce 
U.N. laws. 

"The U.N. at SO

"Few are satisfied 
with this world or-

rights of men,

"Solutions to 
these problems may 
lie in U.N. reform 
and in the emer-

Galey added.

only recently en-
tered the political 
arena. 

Nguyen, who is 
currently docu· 
mentingthe work of 
young women glo-
bally for this 
September's U.N. 
World Conference 
on Women, said the 
United Nations 
should become 
more accountable 
for the effects of its 
policies. 

"We need to con-
sult women of the 
South... women of 
grass-roots organi-
zations... [and] 
younger women," 
Nguyen said. "We 
need to be more 
committed to bring-
ing. .. that kind of ex-
posure [and] those 

. kinds of perspec-
tives ... to the world 
stage. 

"I hope the U.N . 
becomes more of an 
agent of looking at 
its policies toward 
social development 
and how that is af-
fecting women," 
added Nguyen. 

Yuzhakova, dis-
cussing the plight of 
women in her na-
tive Russia, said that

and twice as skilled as her male 
counterpart. 

"Historically, women have been 
few in number and mostly invisible 
in politics, governments and diplo-
macy in or out of the U.N.," said 
Galey. "[A] U.N. Charter has helped 
change this by declaring the equal-
ity of women ... [The charter] en-
abled women to emerge onto the 
world stage, participate in world 
politics and playa role in U.N. re-
form." 

After Galey's keynote address, 
speeches were given by panelists 
Ana Devic, a UCSD graduate stu-
dent from Yugoslavia, Tram 

Several audience members 
brought up similar ideas of reform 
in the world arena of women's is-
sues. One woman said that world 
conferences, rather than government 
action, will be the leading agent of 
change in the "revolution of 
women's issues." 

Anotherwonian said that today 's 
peacetime will encourage the suc-
cess of women, since periods of war 
tend to diminish women's accom-
plishments and advancements.

WALKOUT: 
Administration 
ignores ASE deadline 
Continued from pep 1 
whelmingly in favor of forming 
a walk-out committee. While the 
committee's purpose was to plan 
astrike, the ASEresolution main-
tained that all "good faith ef-
forts" to br:.ea~ the impasse had to 
be exhausted before a walk-out 
could be called. 

The walk-out committee sent 
a last-ditch letter to Chancellor 
Atkinson on Tuesday requesting 
immediate union recognition. 
Issuing an April 21 deadline, the 
ASE stated it would "proceed 
with the necessary actions" if 
their demands were not met. 

UCSD Labor Relations ~an­
ager Mike Melman denied tbe 
request for union recognition in 
an April 21 leiter. 

"Unionization of student aca-
demic appointees would not be 
consistent with the university's 
educational mission," Melman 
stated. "[Unionization] would in-
terfere with the student-faculty 
relationship which is central to 
the educational process." 

Attiyeh echoed Melman's 
written statement, saying "union-
ization is not consistent with the 
way the educational process 
works at the university." 

ASE Board member Kate 
Bums said collective bargaining 
is necessary to limit the size of 
class sections. 

"When T As get overloaded, 
we can't give [students) the at-
tention they need," she said.

4 OPINION 

he GOP's 
"Contract with America" has 
had a wide array of responses, 
both positive and negative. But 
like with so many other Re-
publican-driven decisions and 
proposals (i.e. Persian Gulf 
War, welfare reform, etc.), the 

opposition is louder than the 
GOP itself. This is particularly true on col-
lege campuses - where liberal Demo-
cratic noise emanates and where conser-
vative attitudes are met with such over-
used terms as "draconiao" and "mean-spir-
ited" (see any article opposing California's 
Proposition 187 or House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich), not to mention calling the con-
tract itselfthe "Contract on America" (see 
any recent flyer, commentary, rally or 
speech opposing anything Republican). 

Despite the disagreements over the vi-
ability of "Contract with America," col-
1e&e students appear to overwhelmingly 
agree that one aspect of it is especially 
fllwed: the proposal to cut off federal stu-
dent lid. This proposal, however, is not 
directly addnued anywhere in the text of 
the contract. Instead, it is somewhat of I 
spinoff of the contract. Because one of the 
Republicans' major objectives is to cut 
federal spending to reduce the nltional 
deficit, many of them support cutting off 
federal student aid as I means to help ac-
complish this goal. So, students should be 
protelting neither the contrlct nor 
Gingrich, but ultra-conservatives such as 
Rep. Dick Armey (R-TX) who want to 
abolish students' educational financing by 
the federal government. Gingrich authored 
neither the contract nor this proposal, Ind 
is merely In easy target for Washington's 
shortcomings. 

Last week's protest of Gingrich and 
"Contract with America," which took 
place at UCSD, was an example of trendy 
Newt bashing. Despite popular myth, how-
ever, Gingrich and the contract are not one 
and the same. Gingrich, in his role as

speaker of the House, unfortunately bas 
more opportunities for his often obnoxious 
voice to be heard. And because he is in the 
public eye perhaps more than even the 
president, the prell bas more opportuni-
ties to attack him on everything from his 
ideology to his taste in necItties. 

It is hardly a secret that Gingrich's loud 
mouth often spews seemingly nice ideas 
of which the man know, little. Even the 
Republicans on Capitol HiIIltnow this. 

But by attempling to pinpoint Gingrich 
as the source of the student-loan contro-
versy, students are barking up the wrong 
tree. The contract's primary author, Armey, 
is the one who deserves credit for spread-
ing appallingly bad ideas about where 
spending cuts should be made. He is far 
more conservative than Gingrich and far 

more misguided 15 well. Despite another 
popular myth, however, misguided and 
conseMtive are DOt one and the same, ei-
ther. Although Armey would like. to 
shorten the long arm of the federal gov-
ernment - a sensible conservative goal 
with which most RepublicaDlqree - he 
has Ilso proposed abolishing necessary 
programs such u Social Security, the slid-
ing scale for income tax and, of course, 
federal student loans. 

It was Armey who first called loans 
"an income transfer from the working 
person to the one who looks for an easier 
route" and who named President 
Clinton's national-service plan for slu-
dent loans "a -welfare program for aspir-
ing Yuppies in America." This, by the

Monday, April 24, 1995 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE UCSD COMMUNITY· 
EdItor: 

Since 1992, student academic 
workers on this campus have been 
arguing with the administration over 
our right to union representation. 
The administration has denied us 
our collective bargaining rights, 
claiming that students cannot be 
workers &eause we're learning 
while we work. We find the 
administration's logic faulty, since 
one learns on any job. The univer-
sity ignores the fact that teachers' 
assistants, residence hall advisors, 
resders, tutors and acting instructors 
provide invaluable services to 
UCSD. We want the university com-
munity to notice that our struggle 
for recognition is escalating, and we 
would like to briefly explain why 
we feel so strongly about our need 
for union representation. 

To put it bluntly, we need a union 
for self-protection - not from the 
faculty with whom we work so 
closely, but from the negative ef-
fects of downsizing. To protect the 
quality of education for all students, 
graduate and undergraduate, we 
want enforceable rules which would 
define the limits of our workload, 
class section size and work hours 
per week. When instructors are 
overburdened, our own studies ob-
viously slow down; at the same 
time, the undergraduates enrolled in 
In over-booked section are being 
robbed of the attention for which 
they are paying. 

We also want to negotiate an 
equitable grievance procedure so 
that rules are clear and fair for all 
involved. The administration cur-
rently has unilateral power to 

change the rules of the grievance 
procedure to avoid complaints. In 
1992, for example, the UC revised 
the section of the Academic Person-
nel Manual which defines what is-
sues may be grieved for non-Sen-
ate instructors. Interestingly, they 
removed "workload" from their list. 
One need not subscribe to global 
conspiracy theories to see the more 
sinister dimensions of this current 
arrangement. 

Otber quick reasons why we want 
a union: Every year our health is in 
danger. We have no guarantee that 
the university will continue to pay 
for the health-insurance of student 
academic employees. As people pr0-
viding invaluable labor to the uni-
versity, we deserve this guarantee of 
adequate 'health care, including den-
tal care - which we utterly lack -
and affordable dependent coverage, 
which now costs a graduate student 
$1,000 per year per dependent. Stu-
dent academic employees at other 
universities also receive full fee and 
tuition remission rather than "par-
tial," and undergraduates working as 
TAs receive equal compensation 
based on their labor, rather than on 
their low status in the food chain of 
the university. 

We are concerned about the 
administration '5 misconceptions. In 
a meeting held last fall, Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson expressed his fear 
that unions erode the university's 
quality of education. Atkinson 
seemed unaware of the major uni-
versities across the country which 
have unions representing academic 
student employees, including: U ni-
versity of Massachusetts at Amherst

not crumbled. • 

For these reasons, we uk for as-
sistance from the UCSD community 
in our battle for recognition. It is not 
our wish to impede the educational 
mission of this institution, as we our-
selves are integral to that mission. 
But because we are both integral and 
vulnerable as workers, we must de-

mand respect for our labor. I n the 
coming weeks, it is likely that you 
will encounter picket lines and pro-
tests held by our members. Please 
respect and aid these actions in the 
ways you are able. If there is a walk-
out, please try to avoid campus, or 
if you can't, wear an ASE armband. 
Read and sign our community peti-
tion of support for the ASE which 
will be sent IQ the UCSD chancellor 
and UC president. Watch for our 
tables around campus. 

The Assodadoa or Student 
EmploJeeslVAW 

~ .... ~ 
or Aftlnullwe ActIon 
EdItor: 

There will be a rally Wednesday, 
April 26 at the Hump to educate the 
campus about the current policy de-
bates which threaten access to the 
university. Affirmative action is 
under Ittack and federal student fi-
nancial aid legislation is pending, 
which could result in lone-year loss 
of over $6 million in funding for 
UCSD studentsaIone.ln light of the 
ever-rising tuitions, this constitutes 
an unprecedented obstacle for dis-
advantaged children who are hop-
ing to gain admissions to and be able 
to afford a higher education. 

As a senior on the verge of 
graduation, it might help to explain 
why I am spending my last days 
here fighting an uphill battle. I have 
six younger brothers coming up be-
hind me. I remember the day my 
father dropped me off at Warren 
apartments: He hopped into the car, 
banded me $60 and ordered me to 

SERVING UCSD for 14 years! 

make it last. The bottom line is J 
would IIOt be here witlwul fUlllncial 
aid. I fear my brothers and others 
in the same situation will be denied 
the opportunity to engage in a Iife-
changing process. We are extremely 
privileged to be on a campus dur-
ing a time when so many others Ire 
trapped in situations such IS pris-
ons or poverty. 

I have tried to convey much of 
my own frustrations concerning ac-
cess to my fellow students. After 
five years on this campus, lam still 
an optimist and sincerely believe 
that, on the whole, I have met many 
intelligent and caring people who 
have enriched my collegiate expe-
rience. I seriously doubt the major-
ity of people on this campus would 
support the idea that, as a society, 
we have reached parity. Simply ex-
amining the complexion of the cam-
pus undermines that assumption. I 
also believe most people think the 
financial-aid program is benefICial 
and should be expanded. TM prob-
lem lies in the fact IMt this is a si-
lent majority. The 23 percent of the 
student population which voted tbis 
year bas bad a disproportionate ec0-
nomic and political influence on the 
powers that be. 

The political climate and the 
immediacy of the upcoming events 
clearly indicate that if you are not 
actively working toward a solution, 
you arc part of the problem. Please 
join us in the struggle to keep the 
door to higher education open to 
us all.

WANS: 
ContInued from .... 4 
way, was long before Gingrich de-
cided to follow suit, when, in a 
speech to the National Association 
of Independent Colleges and Uni-
versities, lie said.that Pell Grant re-
cipients should "do more than 
breathe" and called the U,S. De-
partment of. ~ucation "the federal 
Department of Homework Check-
ers." But according to Newsweek 
columnist Michael Isikoff, even 
Gingrich has reservations about 
some of Armey 's ideas. 

Gingrich is merely the man we 
love to hate at the moment. Still 
heaving from the shock of last 
November's election results, liberal 
students bemoan the loss of Demo-
cratic power in Washington. But 
when the presidential campaigns 
heat up for the next elections, stu-
denls are bound to find another 
conservative to chastise, perhaps 
candidate Bob Dole, who has reo 
ceived surprisingly few harsh 
words from students and media 
alike. 

However, if students want to 
convince Congress to leave student 
loans alone, they should focus their 
allention on the proposal itself, not 
on the shortcomings of its propo-
nenls. Dressing up as Gingrich in a 
mock-speech to make him look as 
silly as possible does little, if any-
Ihing, to make Congress take us se-
riously. 11 only shows that we are 
willing to believe whatever the me-
dia tells us, willing to assume that 
Republicans are all inherently evil, 
will ing to lei our leaders - both 
student and national - manipulate 
us to supportlhe trendy cause of the 
day. 

The problem is neither Gingrich 
nor the "Contract with America." 
The problem is two-fold. First, un-
informed government officials 
tend to assume that our educational 
funding is not only dispensable, 
but that cutting it off would not 
affect the lives of poor and middle-
class students who, without finan-
cial aid, would never have had the 
opportunily to attend a university, 
Second, most students rarely dig 
any deeper than finding a name to 
yell out in Ihe next campus protest. 

Whining about unfortunate situ-
ations and badmouthing whoever 
the most unpopular politician hap. 
pens to be does nothing to help our 
pending situation. In stead , we 
should focus on informing our lead-
ers about the specifics of why we 
are opposed to their 'ideas, and of-
fer alternalives - such as 
downsizing the layers of govern-
ment bureaucracy - 10 spending

ContInued from ..... 1 
In the last overall survey , UCSO 

ranked 36th among the nation's 
229 top schools, sharing its posi-
tion with the University of South-
ern California (USC) and Brandeis 
University. , 

And for the last six years, U.S. 
News has also ranked the nation's 
graduate programs in medicine, 
engineering, sciences and the lib-
eral arts, Imong others. 

While some, like Revelle first-
year student Kevin Destro, dis-
miss the rankings as "a stupid 
bunch of numbers," the editors of 
U.S. News have no such illusions 
about their impor-

McFarland echoed those senti-
ments. "San Diego is one of the 
nicest places to go to school," he 
said. 

But for all the talk about warm 
weather and beaches, no student 
made the decision to corne here 
without taking UCSD's academic 
quality into account. 

McFarland said that despite not 
having specific knowledge about 
UCSO's ranking, he knew it was a 
top-notch university. 

"I'm not big into rankings, but 
if you go to a good school, you can 
do what you want," he said. "If I 
get good grades here, I can get a 

good job or get into 
tance. 

On page 89 of 
the magazine, they 
state: "Fairly or un-
fairly , thenameofa

or university on a

doors to jobs and 
graduate schools

students could not 
pinpoint where 
UCSO fell in the 
college rankings. 
most thought the

Almost everyone knows about

campus is generally the first im-
pression made on prospective stu-
dents. 

"UCSO is not as big as UCLA 
or Berkeley," said Oawn Kalmar, 
a high school senior from Berke-
ley, while touring the campus. "It ·s 
kind of an outdoorsy campus."

"Thirty-six sounds feasible." 
said Warren senior Alfredo Farah. 
"I wouldn ' t expect UCSD nation-

However, Revelle senior Jason

graduate schools, felt slighted by 
the ranking. "I thought it would do 
better than that," he said. "[UCSO] 
doesn 't get the recognition it de-

While UCSD assumed the 36th 
spot in U.S. News, other rankings 
have been more generous. The 
Gourman Report, last published 
in 1993, placed UCSD in the 25th 
spot, immediately behind Rice 
University and Carnegie-Mellon. 

UC Berkeley came in sixth. 
with UCLA ranking 10th. 

In addition, U.S. News' most 
recent graduate school rankings 
placed 10 UCSO graduate pro-
grams among the top 20 in the

In the 1994 U.S. News 
"America's Best Colleges" report, 
which was published last Septem-
ber, national universities were 
ranked based on a combination of 
factors, including the follow-
ing: 
• Student selectivity: 
based on entering class test 
scores, proportion of applicants ac-
cepted, percentage of those ac-
cepted who actually enroll and en-
rolled students' high school 
graduation rank. , /

age for faculty and the average 
undergraduate class size. 
• Financial resources: based 
on school's expenditures for its 
education program. including the 
amount spent on student services, 
academic support and administra-
tion. 
• Graduation rate: determined by 
average percentage of students 
from the 1984 to 1987 freshman 
classes who graduated within six 
years. 
• Alumni satisfaction: derived from 
the average percentage of alumni 
who gave to fUnMaising drives.

The Gourman Report is, in the 
words ofthe publisher, "nota 'popu-
larity contest' or an 'opinion poll ;' 
but an objective evaluation which 
synthesizes complex data into a 
deceptively convenient numerical 
rating.· last published in 1993, 
the methodology is not detailed as 
specifically as in the U.S. News 
report. It does, however, list its 
most important factors . 
• The age of a university or pro-
gram. 
• The faculty 's qualifications. 
• The students' scholastic work. 
• The curriculum. 
• The quality of resources. 
• The institutional organization. 
• The academic/athletic balance.

UCSD I .. , 
A number of UCSO's graduate programs were ranked highly by U.S. News & World 
Report and The Gourman Report. Below is a partial list. U.S. News, unlike 
Gourman, does not rank undergraduate departments. However, according to the 
U.S News editors, the strength of the graduate department is often indicative of 
the quality of the undergraduate department.

NUMBERS: 
Budget crisis has

ContInued froIn .... 8 

The UCSD School of Medicine 
was near the head of the class, plac-
ing 14th in a field of 125 resean:h-
orientqil)ledical schools. UCSD's 
biomedical engineering program 
plac:ed fifth in the nation. 

Although the recent U.S. News 
study focused entirely on graduate 
programs, research directors at the 
magazine said that strength in gradu-
ate programs is usually indicative of 
strong undergraduate programs in 
the same field. 

"There is a high degree of corre-
lation because, generaJl y, faculty and 
resources are available to some de-
gree to undergraduates as well as 
graduates," said U.S. News Senior 
Edilor Bob Morris. 

The Gounruzn Report's ranking 
of undergraduate departments backs 
up this assertion. Most of the highly 
ranked undergraduate departments, 
such as the 11th ranked psychology 
program and the eighth ranked bio-
chemistry department, had highly 
ranked graduate department coun-
terparts. 
A QuNtlon of FIIIm ••• 

While many UCSD faculty mem-
bers were quick to point out the 
subjectivity of the ranking process, 
mostagreed thatthe survey rankings 
are fairly representative of the top 
graduate schools. 

"[The School of Medicine] be-
ing in the top 15 is something to be 
proud of," said Director of Health 
Science Communications Leslie 
Franz. "It is a legitimate in,dication 

of the excellence of the program." 
"The ranking is not unreason-

able - plus or minus a few spots, " 
agreed Associate Dean of the School 
of Medicine Dr. Ruth Covell. 

Even Scbool of ~ngineering 
Dean Robert Conn, whose program 
was ranked 43rd, said that such a 
ranking was not a surprise because 
of the department's relative youth. 

"The ranking was not unex-
pected, but no one is ever happy 
with being ranked 43rd," he said. 

According to Conn, the program 
would like to work its way up to the 
top tier in the nation in the next 
several years. 

Political Science Professor Arend 
Lijphart had mixed feelings about 

The UCSD Guardian 

agreed that the restoration of state 
funding will be required for UCSO 
to be fully recognized IS a truly elite 
American univeraity. 
........ 

In the final analysis, however, 
UCSD's ranking is only as impor-
tant as those outside the university 
think it is. 

While almost no graduate school 
admissions officer or prospective 
employer acknowledges consulting 
U.S. News before hiring or making 
an admissions decision, UCSO's 
ranking is still relevant. 

UCSD Medical School Director 
of Admissions Maria Loffpus said 
that, while the medical school does 
not use U.S. News or any other offi-

his graduate 
department's rank-
ing. "[Political Sci-
ence] being placed 
14th is quite grati-
fying, but we really 
belong in the top 
to," he said.

that does not mean

with an 'A'froma

UCSD ' s 
School of Medi-
cine uses its own 
in-house ranking 
system. 

Lijphart added 
that, while UCSO's 
youth has hurt its 
ranking, it has still 
done well. 

reco ... ltlon " 
deserves."

"In its relatively 
short existence. UCSD has achieved 
a position of eminence among 
American universities," Lijphart 
said. 

Prior to California's budget cri-
sis, the UC system was growing stron-
ger by the year, according to CoM. 

"UCSO wason the rise ... ," Conn 
said. "When the difficulty hit the 
state in 1990, the growth stopped." 

Since then, departments have had 
to manage with less money and more 
students. Many department heads 

Revelle Senior 
"All medical 

schools ... that I 
know of, do take into consideration 
the undergraduate institution," she 
said. 

Professor John Wixted, who 
chairs the Psycholog): Graduate Pr0-
gram Admissions Committee, 
agreed with l..offpus' sentiment. 

While the department does not 
use any official rankings, "we know 
North Dakota State is not UC Ber-
keley," Wixted said. 

Wixted added that, dtliPite never 
consulting U.S. News , the 

magazine's rankinp tend to reflect 
what the members of the admis-
sionscommitteealready think about 
different undergraduate institutions. 
In a sense, U.S. News ' report is a 
guide to the consensus among 
academia about the strength of a 
department or institution. 

The ranking of an undergraduate 
program, however, is far less im-
portant than other elements in the 
admission process, Wixted added. 
Letters of recommendation and GRE 
scores both weigh more heavily in 
admissions, he said. 

"[The undergraduate institution] 
is among the least important things," 
Wixted said. "It's more of a tie-
breaker than anything else. " 

Prospective employers also tend 
to use their intuition "ver a 
university's official ranking. More 
important, according to Career Ser-
vices Director Neil Murray, is what 
an employer knows about the school 
from past hiring experiences. 

"I think it is clearly true that 
certain employers are attracted to 
certain schools," Murray said, add-
ing that employers are more inter-
ested in the strength of individual 
departments rather than the school 
as a whole. 

In general, however, "UCSO is 
fairly well positioned," he said. "[Al-
though] it's true we don't have the 
same kind of recognition as a 
Harvard ... or even a Berkeley." 

Loffpus added that "students 
should feel comfortable that they 
are going to a highly ranked institu-
tion." 
n.. ............ 

Although the editors at U.S. News 
stand behind their publication, they 
warn that the rankings should not 

FEAlffRES 9 

serve as the only criteria by whicb a 
university or graduate program is 
ranked. 

"At U.S. News, our editorial mis-
sion is to provide news you can use. 
We write consumer-oriented jour-
nalistic pieces to help people. For 
example, to [help people] make de-
cisions about education," said U.S. 
News Senior Editor Bob Sanoff. "But 
we don't view our rankings as the 
only basis for selecting a graduate 
school, only a useful tool." 

To get that point across, U.S. 
News warns readers in its rankings 
issue tbat "simply because a school 
ranks at the top of its category does 
not mean that it is the best choice for 
every individual." 

In the same way that the NCAA 
basketball rankings can never truly 
account for the "intangibles" that 
make up a winning team, neither 
can a college ranking catalog all the 
elements which make a "great 
school." 

Numbers can never tell the whole 
story. 

But for a college team to get into 
the basketball tournament at all, it 
must meet certain requirements -
at the very least, it must win consis-
tently. 

It is much the same on the aca-
demic side of college life. It is harder 
to impress the people who need to 
be impressed - graduate school 
admissions officers or prospective 
employers - if you are attending a 
college that does not produce con-
sistent academic success stories. 

And that is the story that the 
numbers do tell.

This year's ISS Basketball

This past weekend, 163 
sororities from five different 
states participated In one of the 
largest regional Greek 
competitions in the country. The 
19th annual Inter-Sorority 
Volleyball Tournament (ISVT) 
hosted by Lambda Chi Alpha 
Fraternity from UCSB was once 
again a huge success. Head 
director Chad Larson played a 
prominent role in recuiting 
sorority chapters from all over 
the western U.S., including a 
majority of the sororities here at 
UCSO. "It takes a lot of time and 
dedication to make sure that an 
event ot this magnitude will go 
off," said -Larson. Director Scott 
Carper concuned by adding, 

sororities compete in a round-
robin elimination basis the first 
day, and the teams with the best 
records advance to play on day 
two, where the stakes are higher 
and the level of play is raised a 
notch. A number of the teams 
from UCSO have been perennial 
powerhouses including Kappa 
Kappa Gamma, Delta Gamma, 
and Alpha Chi Omega. 

mind. "We want to raise money 
for a good cause ... ," said Larson. 
The Make-A-Wish Foundation is 
just that. Proceeds from the 
tournament go to this charity 
which takes disabled and 
disadvantaged children and 
helps to make their wishes and 
dreams come true. Through 
entrance fees from sororities and 
anporate sponsorship including 
Gatorade, Miller Lite, Evian, and 
I<ROQ 106.7, this year's ISVT 
raised more money for Make-A-
Wish than ever before. 

Gamma avenged last year's loss • 
in the championship game to 
Kappa Kappa Gamma by beating 
them handily in this years final 
In fact. Delta Gamma's toughest 
game of the tournament was the 
semifinal in which they squeaked 
by Kappa Alpha Theta. Even 
with the loss, Kappa Kappa 
Gamma still holds a hefty lead in 
the ISS Sports Banner chase. They 
have a lead of more than 100 
points over their nearest 
competitors Alpha Chi Omega

has had the times of their lives, 
all the work has already paid

The event not only 
draws sororities from all over, but 
also is probably attended by just 
u many fraternity members who 
road trip religiously to ISVT 
yearly. "It's always a fun time, 
we look forward to it all year," 
said Bryan Westerfeld, who 
helped organize Sig-Ep's road 
trip this year. The fraternities 
don't just go to see the girls, but 
also to meet and spend time with 
other brothers from different 
chapters across the state. After 
the first day of competition is 
over, there were plenty of parties 
and exchanges involving the 
fraternities and sororities back on 
the campus of UCLA, only a few 
miles away-from Will Rogers 
State Beach.

Spealdng at the ExceJ 
Leadership Day, we all

and reflections to offer to aU 
students at UCSD. She 
grew up in a family of

lot of bright students, but if they 
spend all their time in the 
classroom, they are missing out on 
the coUege experience: She 
stresses that students should really 
take advantage of the different 
opportunities in the many fields 
that UCSD has to offer. Although 
Renee has only been at UCSD for 
one and a half years, she is very 
pleased with the number of 
students who devote time to 
extracurricular activities. As 
aforementioned, Renee has been a 
strong advocate of the Greek 
system. She feels that fraternities 
and sororities have a lot to offer 
many students in terms of 
leadership, involvement, and social 
skills. However, Renee also feels 
that the Greek system is not the 
only way for students to tap into 
the leadership scene. She notes that 
many opportunities for students to 
get involved exist; it's just a matter 
of the student finding where his / 
her niche lies. 

Although the number of 
fraternity chapters has inaeased 
nationwide, the number of 
fraternity .members has 
decreased in.recent times. 
Maintaining chapter size is a 
critical issue for all fraternities. 
In the present declining 
fraternity market, could raising 
chapter standards of operation 
and instilling higher personal 
values among undergraduates 
not only reverse the membership 
trend but also revitalize the 
concept of true fraternity? 

seen as an activity of value. 
Response from students who 
are not presently joining but 
should be joining must 
change from, "why should I 
join" to "why wouldn't I 
join.N 

.~ 
she learned the valuable 

skill of speaking out and having 
her voice be heard. She graduated 
from South Carolina State 
University in New Haven, attained 
her Master's at USC, and went on 
to receive her PhD .. from the 
University of New Mexico. She has 
been active as an advocate for 
student leadership, Greek life and 
student involvement at all levels of 
University life. She herself was also 
an active student leader while in 
college serving as the Student Body 
President, Black Students Union 
President and holding many other 
positions in the arena of leadership. 

Her qualifications are many, 
however, one of her most valuable 
assets is her beUef in the 
importance of a well rounded 
education. "Greek life and 
ileadership) activities allow 
students to develop essential skills 
that will be beneficial to the 
campus community," she says, but 
more importantly, she adds, "I 
want to see the reality of the five 
colleges as one community at 
UCSD: Renee is a strong believer 
that a complete University 

11H-114>4>+t1 education must comprise of 
classroom work as weU as 
extracurriculAr work. "We have a 

in her spare time, Renee is 
involved with biblical research and 
teaching. In the past, in add-ition 
to her career as an Assistant and 
Associate Dean, she worked as a 
professional wedding planner and 
as an entrepreneur in running her 
·own cookie company in 
Albuquerque, N.M. called 
Albucookie. After moving to San 
Diego, she hasn't had time to invest 
in entre-preneuria1 endeavors, 
however, she plans on pwsuing 
business in the future in 
conjunction with her positions in 
student affairs and politics. 

Could fraternities influence the 
campus environment and gain 
greater control over 
administrative regulations 
affecting their chapters? Could 
fraternities be seen as the leader 
on values and ethics? 

Fraternities continue to 
recruit some excellent students, 
but the pool of qualified men 
has not been saturated on 
campuses. Men with good 
character, leadership ability, and 
solid academic records are 
finding their niche in 
organizations other than 
fraternities when their 
involvement would make a 
difference in advancing the 
quality of chapter life. 

Fraternities face competition 
for outstanding students. These 
students may only,participate in 
activities in which they see 
immediate value and on-going 
support for career development 

Do you know who UCSD chooses to provide SAT prep for 
~~\l~J their Upward Bound Program? 
~~~ They choose KAPLAN. 1·800~KAP·TEST 
J CJ \ 

In taking action four 
basic themes must be 
emphasized: change in the 
fraternity culture, more structure 
to properly guide collegian 
behavior, massive alumni 
involvement, and a special 
emphasis on values. Fraternities 
have long experienced success in 
these theme areas when 
expanding. The 1980s were years 
of unprecedented growth in the 
fraternity community, and 
although expansion efforts have 
slowed in the 19905 they are still 
and will continue to be bearing 
positive results.

year '5 crew is right there too." 

The varsity-four bOlt also 
reached the final but was unable to 
medal amidst the California compe· 
tition, as it grabbed fifth behind • 
quartet of squads from up north. 

The men's team split their vlr-
sity-eight boat to form a duo of four 
bolts, both of which qualified for 
the grand finale. The top .bolt, with 

. 

Kurt Schnier, John Roosendaal, 
Evan Jacobs, Matt O'Brien and 
John Wing at the coxswain, took 
top honors. The number-two boat 
managed to snlre fifth. 

The women's novice squad had 
the strongest showing of the day. In 
the novice-eight Brace, UCSD 
whipped down the course in a time 
of 7:22 to grab the victory over the 
UCSB crew (7:27). 

The novice-eight A rowers 

rounded out the Triton honors by 
blistering the course in I time of 
7:03. Unfortunately, they were 
topped by a tough team from Sac-
ramento State, which mustered a 
stellar time of 6:56 to the gold. 

"The women's team had the best 
showing of the 14 schools," Vallerga 
said. "I'm very impressed with what 
all the women's teams did. It will 
be an interesting upcoming four 
weeks [until PCRCs]."

18 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian 

Tracksters Trample Point 
Loma in NCAA Tune-Up 
DOMINANCE: UCSD took first place in almost every event during a 
drubbing of host Point Lorna, 114-60 and 97-63, last Saturday 
ByTeddUdd 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD track and field team 
really wasn't out for blood. In fact, 
the Triton tracksters were even will-

ing to take it easy on 
Point Loma at last 
Saturday's dual meet, 
using international 
scoring - only the 
top-two finishers are 
counted toward a 
tcam 's score. 

But that still 
didn't aid the outcome, as the UCSD 
men's and women 's squads simply 
crushed Point Loma into tiny, little 
bits by 54-point and 34-point mar-
gins, respectively. 

cant of the meet," Salerno said. 
Perennial long-distance guru U. 

Castner stole the show in the 1,500 
meters - while entering the event 
only as a pace "rabbit," Castner 
nearly qualified with a 3:55.54 time. 
Also in that race, freshman Mike 
Wallace continued his up-and-com-
ing ways, grabbitrg second in a 
lightning-quick 3:58.93 mark. 

"[Wallace] ran very well. He, 
along with Neal Harder, are going 
to be forces in the future," Salerno . 
said. 

Harder (15:26.16) snatched first 
in the 5,000, while teammate Ernest 
Clark (22.23) also earned the gold 
in the 200. Clark posted the best 
mark all year for Triton men in that 

In the men 's javelin, 
Fabian Andre - coming off 
injury - hurled only one 
throw and hit the mark with 
a first-place, 144'3" dis-
tance. Fellow fieldmate 
Steve Sargeant also took 
first in the high jump with a 
6'4" height. 

On the women 's side, 
there was no shortage of 
award·winning efforts. 
Leading the way again was 
multi-event athlete Michele 
Domico, who qualified in 
the longjump (18'0.5") and 
the triple jump (37'10.25") 
- the latter was a new 
UCSD school record. 

"We've always used the 
Point Loma meet as a measure 
of our squad's strength from 
year to year," Triton Head 
Coach Tony Salerno said. 
"We're up quite a bit from last 
year."

Y"" ZoIoCom/GuanIf .. 

In 1994, the UCSD men 
weakly beat Point Loma by a point, 
and this year they chalked up nu-
merous NCAA qualifiers and per· 
sonal bests. Perhaps the biggest 
standout..of all, was Ioug jU'lllpe1 
&yn Houston, who flew to i 23'11"

event. Other notable performances 
included Juan Magdaraog in the 
lOO:meter race (first in 11.16) and 
Ihe 400-meter relay tcam (first in 
43.18). 

Joyce Lee set a per-
sonal record with a 12.76 
time. Lisa Shepard (14.70) 
did the same in the 100· JJ. ea.t ..... .,...... fI,.t In the 1,lOCHneter r.c. with • 3:11.14 time.

According 10 Wydra, O'Grady's 

80.95 average is due to a lack of 
practice time. O'Grady, who has 
already graduated and is using his 
final quarter of athletic eligibility, 
has been busy working for his own 
fledgling software firm and will, in

Campbell's 78.54, Rob-
erts' 78.88 and 
Behrend's 79.41. 

But this is w here it 
gets tricky for Wydra. 
Jeremy Byrd has the 
slight advantage for the 
fifth NCAA spot be· 
cause of an 80.90 aver· 
age, but he is hindered 
by inexperience.

because he's a genius." 
In any case, Wydra 

will compare each 
player's results at next 
week's regional tour-
ney, and "let the statis· 
tics play themselves 
out as they may." 

-It's a tough choice," 
Wydra said. "Picking 
[Byrd] would be good 
because he could gain 

.. experience to use in the 
future, but [O'Grady] is 
a senior, and he deserves to go to 
Nationals at leu! once in his UCSD 

One statistic that 
Wydra cringes at, how· 
ever, is the Tritons ' 
bloated 312.4 team 
stroke average. Injuries 
and absences have kept 
the average high, but 
UCSD is now at full 
strength. 

"We're coming on 
strong," Wydra said. "We'll be a 
sleeper for Nationals."

Celebrity 
Umps, Unite! 

It's bu-uck! Tritons Point Lorna to the Door 
Baseball, I mean. As of 

April 26, America's Pastime 
returns from its hiatus. Its 
about time. I was in such a 
state of withdrawu.that I was 
starting to follow ice hockey. 

But even though the players 
have returned, all is not well. 
Not yet. There's still one thing 
missing: the umpires. 

Can you believe it? The 
"blues" are locked out. These 
guys are operating on a false 
pretense - namely, that fans 
give a rat's ass about the umps. 
It's one thing if Tony Gwynn 
refuses to take the field, but 
how many people shell out 
their bucks to watch Eric 
Gregg call a game? None. 

But here lies a great 
marketing idea for major 
league baseball: Replace the 
old umps with new ones who 
people will pay to see. 

Ship out those crusty, 250-
pound, no-good has-beens and 
replace them with models and 
other celebrities. Hey, if Cindy 
Crawford were behind the 
plate calling balls and strikes, 
I'd bet the bank that baseball 
would attract legions of fans. 

NCAA BOUND: UCSD trounces Point 
Lorna and CSU-Dorninguez Hills with a 305 
ByTedd Ladd 
Sports Editor 

UCSD men's golf coach 
Mike Wydra has a dilemma. 
Only five players can go to up-

coming NCAA Na-
tionals, and the Tri-
tons normally sport 
a six-man team. 

On May 16, 
someone is going to 
Terre Haute, IN, 

• and someone is 
staying home. The two athletes 
on the bubble are Jeremy Byrd 
and Jim O'Grady, and both were 
part of UCSD's conquest at a 
Quad-Team Tournament at 
Torrey Pines Golf Course last 
Friday. 

"This was easily our best 
match of the year," Wydra said. 
"We shot a 306 at the So. Cal. 
Intercollegiate Tourney [on 
March 10]. This time we did 
better, and the course was just 
as tough." 

single stroke at 321. 
"The rest of the teams were 

just completely blown away by 
our efforts," Wydra said. 

Byrd, a Triton sophomore 
standout, took round one of the 
"Jeremy/Jim joust for the last 
NCAA spot" - he and team-
mate Arnie Campbell shared top 
honors on the leaderboard with 
a pair of 75 's. 

Point Loma's Ryan Carr also 
shot a 75 to create a three-way 
tie for the first-place individual 
medal. 

UCSD co-captain Tom 
Brown, absent from previous 
tourneys because of numerous 
class conflicts, made a trium-
phant return by shooting a sec-
ond-place 77 for the day. 

Only a stroke away, fellow 
Triton Pete Roberts earned a 
stellar 78 on the UCSD home 
course. O'Grady, the resident 
Triton software guru, stormed 
the fifth UCSD team spot with 
an admirable 81. 

Alex Behrend rounded out 
the Triton scoring with a re-
spectable 83, still good enough 
to beat out a majority of the 
other golfers. 

But we don't want to 
alienate the female fans out 
there, even though baseball 
followers are predominantly 
male. So for them, equal . 
members of the umpire crew 
must be guys.

Normally when the PA 
announcer reads the umpire 
names, people aren't paying 
attention, but that would 
change with these celebrity 
crews; it would be the most 
anticipated part of the game: 

Splitsville ·for UCSD and Chapman 
"And here are your umpires 

for today's game: At first base, 
Elle McPherson; at second 
base, Keanu Reeves; at third 
base, Kathy Ireland; and 
behind the plate, Fabio." 

FADING: Tritons don't help dim playoff hopes 
by splitting with Panthers on Friday and Saturday 

The umpires would get 
more cheers than the home 
team itself, and it would knock 
those babied players down a 
notch or two. How do you 
think tbey'U feel when the 
umpires are the ones being 
hounded for autographs? 

Unfortunately, we all know 
that the old umps and baseball 
will eventually settle, robbing 
us of the dream. I guess it's 
just as weU, because getting 
the big-time stars would be 
difficult, what with their own 
busy schedules. 

Besides, they'd never be 
able to fit Fabio with a chest 
protector .

The baseball season is coming to 
a close, but you couldn't tell that to 
the ballplayers out on the Triton Sta-

dium grass this last 
weekend. The 
UCSD baseball team 
is on a mission 
which is best 
summed up in two 
simple words: finish 
strong. 

The Triton slug-
gers (17-12) split the weekend two-
game set with Chapman University 
(15-19), tallying a 7-5 win on Sat-
urday after falling, 3-1, in the open-
ing game on Friday. 

UCSD pitcher Marc Abrams 
started the Saturday affair by giv-
ing up a run in the first inning, but 
he settled down to keep the Tritons

close in the game. Abrams finished 
the contest with two earned runs and 
three strikeouts in five total innings 
of work. 

"Abrams did a good job," team-
mate Eric Quandt said. "We can al-
ways count on him to do a great 
job." 

Quandt was the offensive star of 
the weekend, notching four hits, in-
cluding a clutch three-run triple 
which opened the floodgates to a 
huge, seven-run sixth inning. 

The early innings of Saturday's 
game were looking like a repeat of 
Friday's dismal hitting (which pro-
duced a 3-1 loss ). AI DelFavero had 
a chance to bring in some runs in 
the bottom of the third, but his line-
drive headed for center field was 
caught by the j>anthers' second 
baseman - who then stepped on 
second and threw to first for a rare

The Triton

weekend. 

"We got in a rut for a while, and 
we needed to make a change," As-
sistant Coach Mike Floyd said. "It 
obviously made a difference."
