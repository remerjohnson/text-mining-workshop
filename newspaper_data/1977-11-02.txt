behi'nd the 
whodunits 

by AIaD RuueD 
EdUor 

The man tried to act the role 
of a well - uh. stereotypical 
mystery novel detective. 
Tougb. Assertive. Sexist. 
Discemiq. Confident. Decis-
ive. One rniJbt lOesS from bis 
profeuin that sucb a person-
ality developed naturally. 

John Ball, an author best 
know for his 1965 novella die 
Hea' of die NIP', spoke before 
Ricbard Simon's "Modern 
British and American Crime 
Novels" claas Tbursday and 
gave some insigbts into the 
mystery writing field and bis 
own life. 

A winner of the Edgar Award 
(given to the best mystery 
novel of the year) and Golden 
Dagger Award, Ball is no 
amateur to the field of mystery 
writing. Still, be bad authored 
11 books before turning to 
mysteries, and only resorted to 
the genre because, "I bad an 
idea which could only fit in the 
framework of a mystery. . 

Enter In tbe Heat ' of tbe 
Night. 

The success of that work, 
which introduced his main 
character Virgil Tibbs, has 
propelled Ball into authoring 
five Virgil Tibbs novels, " the 
last one currently in my 
ty pewriter." When asked 
whether mystery writing was 
" easier" than other main-
stream forms, Ball quoted Red 
Smi th, saying, "Writing is 
easy. All you have to do is wait 
for the little red drops to faU off 
you head." 

Ball is serious about the 
writing profession, describing 
the 16 hour days he's sat at the 
ty pewriter, and the strict 
concentration the job takes. 
"One day I was working at the 
typewriter when my wife came 
in without a stitch of clothing. 
She put down my drink and 
went away. I never noticed she 
was naked." 

Idea first 
As for the writing itself, Ball 

stressed, " Don't write before 
you have an idea." He noted the 
importance of developing the 
plot and the making of an 
outline for the story. Of most 
importance to Ball though, is 
the making of stories with 
"people" in them. 

"You don't write a story with 
characters in them," he 
asserted. "You write a story 
with people in them. Let's say 
for the sake of argument there 
are only 37 plots. To hell witb 
that. Tbere are two and one half 
billion people." 

And what kind of "people" 
tand out? "Sherlock Holmes is 

the most celebrated English-
man that ever lived." 

Of hiB own stories, Ball tries 
to make them realistic, saying, 
"I researcb exhaustively." He 
said the most shattel'ing 
experience in his adolescent 
life was finding out that "the 
chemistry in the Tom SwUt 
stories was a buneb of bull," 
and perhaps because of tbat 
s tates, "I refuse to put 
something in a book that is

UC as caretaker of 
Livermore,. Los Alamos: 
CommlHee reviews role In policy decision 

by Joaquin Behindu 
Staff Writer 

The University of California 
has just renewed its contract 
and its caretakership of the 
Livermore and Los Alamos 
laboratories for five more 
years. 

For $3.4 million per year the 
University of California 
becomes the custodian of the 
two laboratories that are 
exclusively responsible for the 
design of every nuclear 
warhead the United States has 
to offer. 

Should UC be involved? 
The questions to be dealt with 

concern the extent to which the 
University should participate 
in policy decision s in the 
otherwise autonomous ar-
rangement and whether the 
University should be involved 
with the laboratories at all . 

In the past, the University of 
California's role simply 
involved signing payroll 
checks, appointing laboratory 
directors, giving permission to 
use the university name on 
letterheads, and acting as an 
occasional buffer for fending 
off the Department of Defense 
and the Energy Research and 
Development Administration 
(ERDA) . Little else has been 
done. 

Supervision? 

PCP: Rise of the 
newest "bummer- dr.ug" 

To determine the exact role 
of the University, President 
Saxon has founded a review 
committee that will meet in 
early Dec. The committee is 
headed by Vice Chancellor 
Wi11am Gerberding while the 
body of the committee consists 
of Professor Carlton B. Bovell 
(Riverside), Professor Louise 
Clubb (Berkeley), Dr. Edward 
Hammel (Los Alamos) , Trudy 
Martin (ASUC President , 
Berkeley) , Professor Robert 
Michaelsen (Santa Barbara), 
Dr. Richard Wagner (Liver-
more) , and Professor Herbert 
F . York (San Diego). Their 
specialities range from Italian 
literature to biology, including 
one student who is majoring in 
political science. 

And who is to supervise two 
laboratories who jointly spend 
approximately $230 million on 
nuclear weapons research and 
another $60 million on research 
that has possible military 
applications? The University of 
California became involved in 
1947 as a result of the McMahon 
Act and has maintained its 
position since then. In 1972, 
however, a group known as the 
Lab Conversion Project 
demanded the opening of the 
contract renewal process and 
since then attention has been 
focusing on the relationship 
between the University of 
California and the two labs and 
whether such research should 
be done at all .

Angel dust. 
The books say that it causes 

brain damage , abdominal 
cramps, terrifying visions , 
uncontrollable rage, numbness 
in arms and legs and (when 
taken in overdose) , comas and 
death. 

The hardened drug dealers 
say it is not worth messing with, 
and shy away from it for their 
personal use. 

Yet, according to U.S. News 
and World Report , abuse of 
angel dust, or phencycline 
(PCP), is reaching epidemic 
proportions. " PCP is becoming 
in white neighborhoods what 
herion has been in black 
ghettos. " 

Why is the drug suddenly 
becoming so popular? 

Cheap, easy to make 
First, it is cheaply and easily 

synthesized in laboratories all 
over the country. Anyone who 
has taken a year of college 
chemistry can make it in his 
own lab; and all of the 
ingredients can be purchased 
legally. 

For this reason, stated one 
student, "a joint is sold on the 
street for $3. People think that's 
a good price for the high. Pot 
usually has to be imported, so 
it's expensive. But PCP is 
cheap to make." 

Another reason for its 
popularity, according to a 
counselor who works for DEFY 
hOtline, IS that people buy it 
thinking that it's something 
else. 

"PCP is often sold as THC, 
mescaline or acid," she said. 
"Many people don't want to get 
Involved with anlel dust 
because they've heard bad 
things about it. They don't know 
that's what they've bought." 

"Bizarre side effects" 
A central nervous depres-

sant, PCP was originally 
produced in the 1950s as a local 
anesthetic, but was quickly 

taken off the market when its 
bizarre side effects where 
discovered. It is now only used 
legally as an animal tranqui-
lizer, but is sold illegally as the 
" New , Improved Bummer 
Drug." 

The fact that users often do 
not know they've taken PCP 
accounts .for the frequent Initial meetings 
overdoses people experience So far some initial meetings 
with the drug. Only one to five have been held, some of which 
miligrams needs to be taken to have been public hearings 
get a person high; if he thinks (where dates are announced 
he has something other than . and public participation is 
PCP, though, he may take as permitted) , while others have 
much as 30 milligrams. been open meetings (where no 

PCP comes in several forms: d ate s are g i ve nan d n 0 
white powder, parsley - or comments are permitted) . 
mint-leaf joints, capsules and There has been one closed 

Regardless of the decision 
made b-y the committee , 
nothing can be done with the 
decision un t il 1982 wh en 
perhaps it may not make any 
difference. (Continued on page 3) session.

I San Diego City CouncU District 7 

Council race -Choice not ech 
by Mark Stadler 

To quote an unsuccessful 
Republican Party presidential 
candidate from the 1960s , 
Evonne Schulze and Larry 
Stirling, candidates in the Nov. 
8 runoff election for the City 

Evo •• e Sc:h.lze 

Council, District 7 seat, offer 
voters "a choice, not an echo." 

Schulze and Stirling disagree 
on practically every major 
campaign issue except two: 
they both favor Prop C, the 
paramedics measure, and Prop 
G, the proposal for a legislative 
analyst for the City Council. 

They both entered politics for 
definite reasons. Schulze, who 
lost a close race for District 7 
four years ago, says " politics is 
the greatest community 
service anyone can get into .. My 
only promise is that I will 
involve people in city decisions 
through their community 
groups. ' 

Stirling says he entered the 
campaign because of his 
concern with the direction the 
city government is taking, with 
regards to ri ing cost. 

Both candidate are running 
well -financed campaign . 
Stirling, 35 , plans to spend 

about $58,000 on the primary 
and general elections, while 
Schulze 43, says she expects to 
spend $40,000 on the two races. 

A major disagreemen t 
between the two candidates

"So that 1 won't make an ass of

As for what happens when 
you don't have the facts, Ball 
recounted a time where he had 
written an article descirbing a 

person as being "as jolly and 
fat as an English bannaid. '/ He 
said that within 24 hours of the 
article's publication hE

BaU's search for veracity 
was detailed by him to the class 
wben he related the exper-
iences of a recent novel. "In 
checking out things I spent 
more than ",000," he said. "I 
was even privileled enoulh to 
have an audience with the Dalai 
Lama." 

A smaU, energetic man with 
silver hair, Ball is impressive 
because of his enthusiasm 
alone. In talking with the class 
for 75 minutes, Ball touched 
upon a number of his interests, 
each one obviously fascinatinl 
to him. He currently is a sworn 
deputy sheriff (earning the 
munificent total of$1. a year). a 
pilot (flew a bomber in World 
War II) and a martial artist. 

"I am a black belt from 
Japan" he said. " It took me 16 
years of bard work to get it. In a 
matter of 11 or 12 seconds all 
those hours of sweat paid off. 
Two guys jumped me . I'm 
alive." 

Currently taking up mucb of 
Ball's time is his post as 
Chairman of the Board of the 
Mystery Library. The Mystery 
Library. established by 
UCSD's University Extension. 
has for the past year been 
trying to bring " respectability 
to the mystery field" by 
resurrecting classic mysteries 
of the past and doing serious 
critiques within the genre . 

The effort to gain greater 
public respect for the mysteryl 
form is obviously important to 
Ball. who. right and left in his 
talk. " assigned" unheard-of 
mystery classics that were a 
" must" for the class to read. 

One wouldn ' t doubt he 'd 
murder for his art form. 

Hey. now there's an idea for 
a novel.

council can take to reduce city 
taxes. 

Schulze, whose son Mark. 
attends Warren College. says 
city property taxes can be 
lowered if the council evens out 
the proportion of tax revenue it 
garners from property and 
business taxes. Currently. 
Schulze says. the proportion is 
75 percent from property taxes 
and 25 percent from business 
levies. 

Also, people must realize the 
government cannot provide aU 
the services tbey demand 
without taxes going uP. Schulze 
says. 

Stirling says taxes could be 
lowered if "the terrible waste 
and duplication" that now 
exists within city agencies, 
departments and boards is 
ended. There are 251 separate 
independent taxing alencies In 
the county. Stirling says. and 
all offer "overlapping and 
duplicated services." 

On metbods to ease San 
Diego's unemployment rate. 
which is calculated at 9.6 
percent. Stirling says the city 
goernment must realize 
private industry is the source of 
secure employment. and work 
with business. not against it. 

"Joke and n.isaace" 
One way Stirling says the 

government could do this is by 
repealinl tbe city's $25 
business license tax, which he 
calls "a joke and a nuisance." 
the tax indicates an anti-
business attitude and business 
is "very much a matter of 
attitude. II Stirling says.

Schulze also believes the way 
to lower unemployment is to 
create a better business 
climate. but feels the license 
tax does not have an effect on 
that climate. Rather. abe says 
the city should actIvely seek out 
small. clean industry and offer 
them "basic amenities" like a 
deferment on a portion of their 
taxes until they are established 
in San Diego. 

On the Freilich plan. a 
growth management proposal 
that divides the city into four 
tiers and gives priority to 
development in established 
neighborboods. Scbulze says 
"We baven't even proven 
there's enough land in the first 
two tiers (the established 
neighborhoods) to meet our 
housing needs for one year." 

Schulze. wbo says she is 
"very supportive" of managed 
growth. adds there aren't 
adequate provisions in the plan 
to ensure enough low and 
middle income housing in the 
city. 

ClliIling effecl 
Stirling - wbo says the plan 

"demonstrates the age-old 
principles of lood planning. 
.which I support." - says the 
tiers are drawn in an "arbi-
trary and capriciOUS fashion" 
that could bave a chilliq effect 
on bousing in the city. 

Both candidates agree a key 
to reducing crime in San Dielo 
is an exparWon of the police 
force. Stirling says this could be 
done by transferriq some dealt 
officers to the police academy 
in order to facilitate training of 
new officers. 

Scbulze says the force should 
immediately be brought up to 
its budget capacity. whicb sbe 
estimates will add 125 new 
officers to the force. •

varied effects of tbe drug. 

"I felt II tbougb 1 had no 
control over my body. as if it 
wasll't a part 01 me." said one. 

Said anotber. "It maltes

yOU feel mellowed out. It 
doesn't expand you mind - it jut makes you feel like you're 
watchinl yourself. You are 
your own spectator." 

Fried brain 
" It would be easy to do 

something without thinking." 
said on ex-user. "It fries your 
brain." 

Often people experience 
de lusions while under the 
influence of the drug. Accord-
ing to Kate Comeau of Path-
ways Counseling Center in 
Pac ific Beach, "tbey are 
different from the hallucina-
tions produced by LSD because 
the person actually believes 
that they, (the ballucinatIons) 
are there." 

" It's like. 'I'm God and 
you're the devil.' rather than 
'W ow . man. loolt at the 
colors ... • commented one user. 

While under the influence of 
the drul. another user said, "I 
am more powerful than anyone 
else here. 1 could destroy yr 
all ." 

Stories about the effects of 
people's PCP-induced actions 
of violence are probably the 
most well-publicized aspect of 
the drug. pcp. said a medical 
expert. "produces psychoses 
nearly indistinguishable from 
schizopbrenia. II 

"PCP produces bizarre, 
schizo, paranoid behavior." 
said the DEFY hotline coun-
soler. "It is very dangerous 
because one's sensory percep-
tion becomes inaccurate." 

Recognition of the drug's 
ability to cb.ange people's 
personalities is becoming so 
well-known that lawyers have 
begun citing use of PCP as a 
defense in murder trials. In the 
last year. quite a few acts of 
violence occurred when a 
criminal was under the 
influence of PCP. 

However. many users are 
sceptical of tJle validity of the 
claim that PCP caused a person 
to commit a violent crime.

as well as on nationwide 
television shows such as "60

Despite all the publicity. 
though. officials at UCSD seem 
to be remarkably ignorant 
about abuse of the drug at this 
campus. 

"Most of the time we are the 
last to know about things like

Student Health Center. Added a 
dcotor. "We are not set up to 
handle emergencies , so we 
don't usually see cases of drug 
abuse." 

When asked if she bad heard 
of angel dust , one nurse 
responded. "Oh. 1 think it's 
awful! I'd never heard of it until 
I saw it on television last 
week." 

Ignorance 
The campus police showed a 

similar lack of firstband . 
knowledgt. about users of 
the drug. Said one officer. "We 
haven't received any calls 
about it. I don't think it is used 
on this campus at all ."

TT's 'lack of coverage' 
on Bakke irks ex-editor 

Recent issues of the Triton Times have included a marked 
contrast that I believe deserves further attention. 

On one band you have an obviously well-researched article by 
Mark Stadler (TT, Oct. 24) on alleled manuevers by Chancellor 
McElroy. The story's author deserves commendation. 

On the otber band, there bas been the ~overage of. the 
controverSial Bakke decision, a UC laue whlch bas rece~ved 
national attention, bas reached the US Supreme Court, and 18 of 
vital concern to many local students. The coverage bas been 
mainly nonexistant; when existiq it has been far from what the 
paper is capable of. 

I found the inabflity of the Triton Times to reacb a collective 
decision on Bakke, something which was accomplished by all of 
tbe other UC newspapers, quite disappointing. I found the two 
articles by Laura Richter and Ran Anbar, printed in lieu of an 
editorial even more disappointing. I suppose I expect alot from 
the Trito'n Times, and I also believe that newspapers, which have 
nearly unlimited resources in the forms of people and data, should 
strive to infonn the public. 

The two editorials, though, were quite narrow, and it appeared 
that the writers simply sat down at their typewriters and batted 
out an opinion. They did little to educate the public. 

Come to think of it, there has been a total lack of editorials from 
the Triton Times on any subject. Are we to believe that you cannot 
come to a collective opinion on anything? 

Further, you failed to provide any coverage ofthe last week's on· 
campus Bakke debate, which featured experts on the Bakke 
controversy. Certainly, if the Triton Tim~s did not research ~e 
Bakke situation, coverage of the debate mlght have been a step an 
the right direction. 

Come on Triton Times. There are people on this campus with 
insight into the Bakke decision, and many student~ wo~ld 
appreciate reading what they have to say. It would make It easIer 
for. all of us, I suppose even the edit.orial board of the Trito~ Tim~s, 
to come to an educated conclUSIon about Bakke, Afflrmatlve 
Action and racial quotas . 

Please read tbe enclosed 
letter from Davis and note the 
last sentence of the third 
paragraph . An American 
AnglerSaxon white essentially 
forced to go to a foreign 
Medical School because there 
was no room for him as a 
freshman, now cannot obtain 
entry into a California Medical 
School because he went to a 
foreign school! ! ! 

I am amazed and. shocked at 
the sudden surge in concern for 
moral responsibility exhibited 
by people who claim to 
" respect buman life in any and 
all of its phases." To single out 
the University's policies on 
abortion and aply large doses of 
indignant righteousness 
reveals an attitude of the 
narrow~st form. 

For years now, UCSD has 
been the third-ranldng institu- _____ --:-___ -----::--::::--==:----D-A--VID-E-I-SE-:-N

Before this koala business 
goes too far at UCSD, let's get a 
few facts straight. Koalas are 
not native Californians, not 
even natives of America - they 
occur only in Eastern Australia 
where they are likely to die out 
eventually because of a 
singular lack of intelligence 
and an inability to cope with the 
advance of "civilization." They 
are sluggish both physically 
and mentally. 

In their enclosure at the San 
Diego Zoo, koala bears -
usually invisible, because they 
like to sleep during the daytime . 
- seem to be peculiarly prone 
to blindness and to cancer. 
Their one attractive attribute is 
their apparent cuddliness -
but is this a virtUTe we want to 
be especially proud of at 
UCSD? 

In contrast, sea-otters are 
active, equally agile on land 

and in the water, among the 
most intelligent of animals 
(they use tools! ) - and they are 
genuine natives of the Californ· 
ia coasts . If we want a 
University mascot, we need 
look no further .

A garden of red-tape 
Chronicle of a deaf stUdent 

Cbapter One 
1st week Monday: Talked to Randy about getting a typewriter 

for a pair of classes said that I could get it through the dept. Went to 
VA dept. and Mrs. Baxter said that they would make too much 
noise ... advised on other alternatives. Talked with Mr. Hamroll 
prof for sculpture and said that we can work something out Talked 
with Jim Beckley abut getting a typewriter but that they would 
need prof approval. 

. Put down the pen and bury the axe 
Tues.: No typewriter turned up for today's lectures. Talked with 

Phil Steinmetz, photography prof, I will agree to have a notetaker, 
Ann, for his class; advised me to contact the class list before 
Thurs. class . 

Wed.: Didn't get much out of sculpture today as I have not got 
this class worked out yet, talked with Ha roll about this and said 
that we can get this worked out soon. Prof Analaro's ceramics 
class, meets next week but we have it all \ orked out; he agreed to 
spend some extra time with me to make sure I'm caught up.

The stucleDta involved with 
campua poIJtic8 communicate 
through the media, rather than 
worldni one on one, face to 
face. Every time the~ is a 
disaereement over the islues or 
a misunderstanding, everyone 
involved runs for a pen to vent 
their aDler in print. 

These articles are for the 
benefit of the participants in the 
arlument. Tbey are not 
directed to the student body at 
lafle. These writings present to 
the students enoup conflicting 
information to make anyone 
sceptical. Couldn't these 
differences be resolved through 
mutual discussion ~d open 
communication? What good is 
it if we bury ourselves with 

Student government at UCSD 
isn't a struggle to build 
community, it is a war on 
nerves. The Associated 
Students want what is right-
fully theirs as a central 
government. The Colleges want 
what belODis to them. Organi-
zations want their piece of the 
action. Individuals are con-
cerned wtih their own needs, 
not community gain . Our 
approach to problems is to fight 
over territoriality, rather than 
to work together and col1abor~ 
ate. When we take a break from 
cbewing each other apart there 
isn't much left. 

Tbun.: Am on Phil's list so that wraps up photography, which 
should be fun . Must have seen Jim a couple times this week, 
anyway lIo typewriter showed up. Float on this problem till next 
week. 

Chapter Two 
ZIId Week: Got Dr. Nodelman's permission to use a typewriter, 

and then contacted Jim, so-so til Tuesday. Talked with Mr. 
Sullivan; Media prof who said that a typist could be arranged in 
the booth if he used a mike. Prof Hamroll said thatI would have an 
independent study project like the rest ofthe cl8fJs, that settles this 
class. . , 

Thurs.: Contacted Jim before lecture. He had no typist yet so I 
had to ask for a tape recorder ... why miss any more lectures?? 
Brought it to Dr. Nodelman's lecture and returned it after lecture. 

Fri.: Checked to see if they transcribed the tapes, and as 
expected they hadn't. Also contacted Elizabeth the TA for 
Nodelman's class. She will give me copies .of her lecture and 
section notes, wbich I thought was a very generous offer. 

Chapter Three 
3rd Week: The Media lab TA, Greg, of Sullivan's class got me 

worldng with my group, so this class went ok. Tapes have not been 
transcribed. 

The student government is 
caught in a vicious circle. No 
one will support the AS until it 
bas positive programs and 
organized projects . The A~ 

'/ can't get itself off the .g~d 
_ because it spends aU of Its time 

responding to negative criti-
cism. 

Tues.: Brought tbat tape recorder to the lectures; can't seem to 
decide if I want to put it in Sullivan's or Nodelmao's lecture as the 
two overlap a little. Ummm, Sullivan is wondering wby they 
baven't put the typewriter in yet, so guess I'll just have to sit 
through the lecture today. Dr. Nodelman was ill so no lecture 
today, whew what a relief, rather risky with all this overlapping.

VISI' 

The value of criticism should 
be weigbted by the ability of a 
person to back a discussion of 
tbe problems with positive 
effort and support. I have yet to 
see the amount of enerlY that 
goes into internal bickering 
matched by positive and 
directed approacbes to the 
problems tbat we face. 

.Thurs.: Brought tape recorder to Nodelman's lecture, returned 
it and found, would you believe it that they still haven' t transcribed 
the tapes yet, not event he first tapes I did, why they are probably 
gathering dust. Jim lert a note saying that be is understaffed but 
that he would be responsible for transcribing the previous tapes 
and tapes up to Oct. '24. 

Fri.: Elizabeth gave me some of her notes before the section so 

Student government will 
reflect what students give to it 
and what students take away 
from it. Criticism is much 
easier to provide than time and 
commitment. Tbe Associated 
Students can use its vast 
resources and potential to 
make some of its campaign 
promises a reality, but only if 
students are willing to make it 
work and belp it happen.

New film "Julia" 
is artistic, but 
falls into traps 

by Jill t.dse aazeley 
Ana "rller 

It wu because of movies like this that Neil 
SimoIr wrote "Murder By Death." "Julia" 
IJ'Opes desperately to portray the tender story of 
the love between two wOlnen-frienda, U1llaD 
Hellman aad ber childhood companion Julia, 
but succumbs to Its own weilhtlneuln the form 
of an all too unlikely .. pionaee drama. If they 
eave academy awards for "at the last minute" 
and "bow could sbe be 80 dumb?" this film 
would certainly win them.. Tboup the story of 
tbe indomitable Julia's anti-facist underground 
activities and tbe somewbat too innocent 
Lillian's brave, lip-bitine attempt to help out by 
smuggling money into Germany is true, the 
toucbing nature of the friendship that led J ewisb 
Hellman into Nazi Germany is overwhelmed by 
Fred Zinneman's absurd treatment. 

"Julia" is a painterly film - we are aware of 
tbe artist Zinneman as be strokes on tbe 
silnificance and the suspense. And this is wbat 
does the film in from the belinning wben Lillian 
speaks of "'pentimento' - because the painter 
repented - cbanged biB mind." Had Zinneman repented, "Julia" miebt not bave been so .,...--LlL-_______________ --. 
contrivedly artistic and symbolic - be milbt New genre JOolts LA 
bave even painted over the Gare St. Lazare train 
station scene since the exact same one's already S e b 
been done twice by the impressionists. prlngsteen 0 

Tbis Is not to say, bowever, tbat tbe 
cinematograpby is not beautiful- itis. Watery 
melting blues and violets, tbe wbite ligbts of 
trains, rain pregnant clouds and a little 
blurriness make for a flowing , dreamlike 
quality. Only the water and train images are 
just too darn significant. (OfwbatI don't know.) 

Jane Fonda as Lillian and Vanessa Redgrave 
as Julia give outstanding performances as -
friends . ~ad "Julia" been done rigbt it would 
bave been a film for crying at so strone is tbe 
pOrtrayal of a friendsbip not even ended by 
deatb. Pathos. not sentimentality. is the power 
Fonda and Redgrave create together. 
Ironically. Lillian's Broadway success at the 
time of tbis story is with "The Children'S Hour"; 
yet the relationship between real life and play is 
minimal . "Julia" explores the intimacy of two 
best female friends - a Significant (ooh!) veer 
qway from the Newman/Redford tradition . 

"I love you Julia" is one ofthe cleanest lines in 
film history and, if you can sit through the movie 
at least a little impervious to the absurdities, is 
one of the most touching and (I hate the word) -
significant. 

Quartet to pIa y 

by Madeliae KJetzldn 
Los Angeles received somewhat of a jolt 

last month: first beadline appearance of 
Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes at 
the Roxy Theatre. 

The Jukes' rise to fame from their roots 
down the Jersey shore has a lot to do with the 
belp, support and song writing abil~ty of 
their friend Bruce Springsteen, who is aptly 
nicknamed the Boss. Springsteen, Miami 
Steve Van Zandt (one time leader of the 
Jukes, turned producer and song writer for 
the band) and Southside Johnny Lyons all 
met and played together at the now 
legendary Upstage Club in Asbury Park, 
N.J . This loose, creative beginning accounts 
for a lot of the give and take among these 
musicians . 

Springsteen and the Jukes have created a 
new genre in music, S.O.A.P. (Sounds of 
Asbury Park) , which is streetwise dancing 
music with a strong rhythm and blues 
current. S.O.A.P. is now so much a part of 
the East Coast tradition that it seems to be 
spreading West. At least tbe capacity crowd 
at the Roxy felt that way. 

The band opened with the title track from 
their latest album, This Time U's For Real, 
written by Miami Steve, who was on stage

So what ' s new witb the 
Mystery Library? 

"It's been going wild." said 
Caleb "Shelly" Lewis, Director 
of University's Extensi'on 
Media Program and coordina-
tor of the Mystery Library 
project. 

Although subicriptions to the 
Mystery Library "have not 
been overwhelming," tbe 
founders are nonetheless 
enthusiastic by an upcoming 
movie series sponsored by the 
Corporation for Public Broad-
casting, 

The editorial board of the 
Mystery Library met recenUy 
to select 13 American mystery 
stories never done before on 
screen. Their selections, still 
"secret," will result in " two 
hour original movies," 

Chuck Fries Productions will 
be doing the works. 

The only current roadblock is 
the gathering of corporation 
money to back the project, but 
things seem "to be progres-
sing."

co mmittee table during 
meetings .maybe he knows 
what's going on. Sounds like a 
nice penon to try. Said that he 
doesn't even know I'm looking 
for the typist. Said he'd ask 
Randy about this ... Randy goes 
in Mon. to 8ee Cindy my Rehab 
counselor for some funds. 
Wonder why they are locked up 
with Rebab? Surely a school 
like this should have some 
funds for this problem. witb 
those millions of dollars they 
get for research and education. 
Gave Kay names of three 
typists. 
Chapter Five 

5li1 week Monday: Talked 
with Ernie Mort this morning to 
see if I would get better service 
in a different college and I 
guess that I wouldn't. He said 
that be would contact Randy 
Woodard and 8ee if they can 
work IOmetbing out. This is 
awful. 

It is Monday night and 
tomorrow I have an appoint-
ment for my Rehabilitation 
Counselor. Cindy. I'm not too 
sure what can be done this late 
in the quarter but then maybe 
abe does have an answer.
