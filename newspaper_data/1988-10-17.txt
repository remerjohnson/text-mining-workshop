Students Rally 
Against Bush 
Scripps Stop 
By A.M. BEZZERIDES 
NewJ Editor and 
DAVID BROOKS 
Senior SttIjJ Writer 

A small but vocal contingent of 
UCSD students protested Vice 
President George Bush's campaign 
stop Friday at the Scripps Insti-
tute of Oceanography. 

Approximately 100 students 
armed with drums and assorted 
noisemakers marched down the 
hill towards the entrance of the 
speaking area, but were quickly 
rerouted by U CS D campus police 
and San Diego police. 

Revelle Senior Darryl Biniaz 
claimed that San Diego police 
officers riding on four-wheel 
ATVs used excessive force in 
attempting to clear the street 
through which spectators expect-
ed Bush to arrive. 

LA San Diego police officer] 
stuck a night club in my face," 
Biniaz said, adding that he was 
lucky when a UC police officer 
intervened and pulled him off to 
the side. 

San Diego police officers 
grabbed Dukakis signs from sup-
porters on the sidewalk and 
removed all the wooden stakes in 
an attempt to control and safe-
guard the line of spectators who 
were outside the entrance. 

Apparently the protest, organ-
ized by the Che Cafe and other 
co-op members, was pulled to-

A. S. 'Student Rights' 
Resolution Rejected 

By ERIC CHAZANKIN

A resolution by Student Advocate Bard-Alan Finlan intended to 
"protect student rights" sparked a heated debate at last Wednesday's 
A.S. Council meeting. 

Councilmembers also discussed a proposal for off-campus advertis-

Bush Uses Scripps 
For Ecology Speech 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Republican presidential candidate George Bush claimed once again 
that he is an "environmentalist" while speaking last Friday at Scripp's 
Institute of Oceanography (SIO), with the Pacific Ocean behind him 
and a crowd of what one observer termed "rich people from La Jolla" 
in front of him. 

"I don't see too many Scripps people here," said OOr. William 
Thomas, a professor.emeritus at SIO who has worked for 37 years at 
the famed oceanographic institution. 

The Bush campaign apparently chose the location for his twenty-
minute speech on environmental issues strictly for its "photo oppor-
tunity" potential. 

The candidate said little that related to the research and educational 
missions of SIO, and his promise to "lead the search for alternative 
fuels" flew in the face of contentions by two SIO researchers that their 
own searches for alternative fuels "'ad been dealt setbacks by the 
Reagan j Bush administration. 

Dr. Thomas had been a part of an effort to harness solar energy that 
was initiated by the Carter administration, but whose funding is now so 
minimal that the program barely exists. 

Another Scripps researcher, Dr. Ralph Lewin, is currently research-
ing oil-producing algae that may help replace the earth's dwindling 
reserves of petroleum, and he said recently that his budget has also 
been cut. 

When asked his opinion of Bush's speech, Lewin would only reply 
that he thought "three out ofthe four people we have running for office 
are intelligent characters." 

The one left over, Republican vice-presidential candidate Dan 
Quayle, was not mentioned at aU by Bush, who also directly attacked 
hiS opponent, Democratic candidate Michael Oukakis, only once. 
Instead, Bush concentrated on issues such as national parks, clean air, 
alternative fuels, the dumping of waste into the ocean, offshore drilling, 
and his "thousand points of light. to 

Governor George Deukmejian introduced Bush by noting that "a 
clean, enjoyable, prosperous quality of life is important for all Califor-
nians." A small group of Oukakis partisans started to laugh when the 
governor noted that Bush "will be committed to protecting a healthy 
economy and a healthy environment in California," but were quickly 
drowned by applause from the overwhelmingly white, pro-Bush

BUSH: at Scripps 
Continued from pale 1 
crowd, a sequence of events that occurred several times 
during the speech. 

Bush began by noting the "spectacular setting" that 
surrounded him, and he described SIO as "one of the 
most prestigious centers for marine science research, 
and certainly one of the great training centers of the 
entire world ." 

He did not, however, give his opinion of UCSD, of 
which SIO is but one of several parts, and, in fact, one of 
the reporters covering the speech was not even aware of 
the existence of the rest of the university (besides SIO). 

After a brief reference to the previous evening's 
debate, Bush said he "wanted to lay aside the hot rhe-
!oric of the political campaign ... . and [talk about] work-
mg for a safer and cleaner environment. 

"I want to lead this country, and the other nations of 
the.world, too, to a greater understanding of the threats 
facmg our planet, and to a greater committment to 
meeting and resolving them," Bush said. 

He said that enjoying the outdoors is "a part of my 
blood," and offered as an example his efforts to protect 
the ozone layer. 
. He then t.hrew a backhanded jab at Dukakis by stat-
109 that environmental concerns are "international, and 
it is nice to have some experience in international 
affairs." 

Bush has repeatedly assailed his opponent for lacking 
experience in foreign policy matters, while the vice-
president has described his current job and his previous 
work as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations as 
giving him "experience in international affairs." 

After telling the "scientists" in the crowd, who were 
apparently few in number, that he is "committed to 
conservation," he declared .. [ am an environmentalist, 
and [ know that a better America is a cleaner America. " 

"The goal of a clean and healthy environment is not in 
conflict with the need to create jobs in a growing econ-
omy. Quite the contrary. In the long run, successful 
economic protection is a prerequisite to solid, sustaina-
ble economic growth," Bush said. 

"Many of the major environmental problems we 
face . .. are truly international in nature, and their solu-
tion will require a president who is adept at negotiating 
with friend and foe alike, a president who will lead on a 
global scale, and who has the experience and the knowl-
edge to do so, and frankly, I believe this is one strength I 
possess that my opponent may well lack," Bush said, 
without substantiating his lu~rtion. 

Bush repeated I)is claim 'of the previous evening that 
"one of the little known successes of the administration 
has been to eliminate the overwhelming majority of 
airborne lead ." See BUSH, pale 3 

PROTESTERS 
Continued from pale 1 
led together the morning 
of the speech after cam-
pus radio KSDT broad-
casted announcements 
over the Hump. 

KSDT member Wil-
liam Gyney said that the 
protesters organized the 
"totally spur of the 
moment" rally after read-
ing about Bush's cam-
paign stop in the Guar-
dian. 

Chanting such things 
as "Go to Panama and 
don't come back" and 
" Bush off Campus" to 
drum beatings, the pro-
testers were heard by 
spectators in the speech 
area. 

Bush supporters who 
did not have tickets to be 
in the actual speech area 
complained that they 
could not hear their can-
didate's speech coming 
through the loudlpeaker 
over protesters yelling 
such things as "Vote for 
Bush and kill for free'" 

One woman com-
plained that the UCSD 

J j , 

student protesters were 
rude and they were 
denying her and "Bush 
[their] Firs~ Amendment 
rights" by chanting, yel-
ling out comments and 
beating drums. 

UCSD student Joe 
Finley, president of the 
campus group Voters for 
the Democratic Ticket, 
said that his group of 
Dukakis supporters and 
the group from the Che 
were part of the same 
demonstration. 

"The only thing my 
group did was organize 
with signs to take away 
from George Bush's spot-
light. The Che people 
were on their own," Fin-
ley said . 

Dukakis pre~~ volun-
teer Jeff Hill said that 
although the student 
protest group had no-
thing to do with the offi-
cial Dukakis campaian, 
he was "surprised and 
pleased at the spontane-
ous outturn of [student] 
Dukakis supporters."

BUSH: Environmental Record Reviewed 
Continued from pale 2 

However, ABC's John Wooten 
revealed on Friday evening's 
"World News Tonight" that Bush 
had chaired a commission that 
opposed the regulations that led 
to the reduction of airborne lead. 

"One of my priorities as vice-
president has been to lead the 
search for alternative fuels ... and 
I am proud to report that pro-
gress is out there on the horizon . . . " 
Bush said. 

He also called for the reauthor-
ization of the Clean Air Act, and 
he bemoaned the fact that the 
current Congress had adjourned 
before passing this act, and prom-
ised he will ensure its passage if 
elected president. 

Bush also decribed the dump-
ing of waste into the seas. "There 
are threats to that ocean ... and 
one is the dumpina of barely 
treated sewage and sludge from 
sewaae plants into the ocean," he 
said. "And on the East Coast, 
problems that arise from the neg-
lect of the ocean have been espe-
cially apparent this summer. 
ClOlCd beaches, horrible medical 
wastes washing up on the shores .. . 

"We should work with the states 
to track the dispoaal of medical 
wastes in order to prevent them 
from washing up on our beaches," 
the candidate added. After con-
tinuing on about "insidious medi-
cal wastes" at some length, Bush 
changed the subject to offshore 
drilling. 

"I do believe that development 
of our most promising oil and gas 
reserves is called for because con-
tinued domestic production of oil 

and gas is vital to the national 
security of our cO!Jntry," Bush 
said. 

"At the same time, I oppose 
drilling in those environmentally 
sensitive areas where the risk of 
damage is too great. And I've 
said, indeed I think I had some-
thing to do with, delaying any 
drilling under lease sale 91 in 
Northern California pendingenvi-
ronmental concerns. " 

Bush neither defined "environ-
mentally sensitive areas" nor ex-
plicitly stated whether or not he 
"had something to do with" delay-
ing the drilling of that particular 
area in Northern California. 

"We cannot, and I will not, 
allow California's golden shores, 
it's most precious treasure, to be 
put at risk ... and I know that w~t 
I've said here is not incompatible 
with getting our country less 
'dependent on foreign oil. We 
cannot put our fate into the hands 
of countries halfway around the 
world," Bush declared. 

While discoursing on the sub-
ject of national parks, and the 
"forty thousand Americans" that 
have "chipped in" to help manage 
them, Bush said that "herein I do 
have a fundamental difference 
with my opponent. He doesn't 
understand, in my view, what 
volunteerism can do. I talk of a 
'thousand points of light,' and his 
people ridicule it." 

As laughter interrupted him, he 
continued, "There they are, they 
don't understand. They don't 
understand that what makes our 
country great ... is not the federal 
government standing alone, it's 

UCSD NATIONAL ISSUES FORUM 

. what American citizens do ... to 
help make it better." 

"I've tried to get through the 
whole day without saying the 
word 'liberal' - the liberals don't 
understand t/.lis," Bush declared, 
to the cheers of the partisan 
audience. 

"Parks are for people, and we 
should take the greatest care to 
enhance and protect those parks 
which are near enough for people 
to enjoy," Bush continued, and he 
added that ~parks near our urban 
centers should be our highest 
'priority ... 

Bush also unveiled YES. Youth 
Entering Service to America, 
and said he'd like "to see legions 
of our young people volunteer to 
keep our parks in shape." Security - A police officer keeps watch from a stairway during 

The candidate also talked about Vice President George Bush's speech Friday. 
a recent vacation he and his wife r-------------------------
Barbara took with a grandson to 
the Grand Tetons, and the deci-
sion he made then: "And so I have 
resolved that if I am elected Pres-
ident of the United States, I will 
undertake a program to streng-
then and preserve our parks. 111 
call it • America the Beautiful,' 
because that's eJW:tly what this 
great country of ours is, beautiful 
beyond all comprehension ... " 

He then called upon Irving Ber-
lin's (the composer of "America 
the Beautiful,,) "pristine"vision of 
America, and ca\Ied it the Amer-
ica he wanted "God to bless, too." 

Atkinson said afterwards that 
he found the candidate's discourse 
"fairly substantial" and discerned 
a "solid committment to tbe 
environment" in what Bush had 
said. He did not elaborate.

Leo McCarthy 
The election for the U .S . Senate in California has 

one real issue: is the incumbent, Pete Wilson, the 
kind of representative we want in Congress? 

That's not to say that his opponent, Lt. Governor 
Leo McCarthy of San Francisco isn't worth talking 
about . He's a traditional Democrat especially strong 
on legislative politics, the environment and entitle-
ment programs. 

ENDORSEMENTS 11 
It's just that Wilson has carved out a clear record in 

the Senate, one of which he's proud. He promises 
more of the same. Here's what more of the same 
means: 

On the environment, Wilson opposes off-shore 
drilling as does every politician in the state eager to 
avoid political suicide. However, when you get to 
issues involving smaller, less active concentrations of 
voters, his record is awful. He favors, for example, 
continued access to and trashing ofthe Anza-Borrego 
and Mojave deserts by off road vehicles. 

On education, Wilson has consistently lagged in his 
support for student loan and financial aid programs. 
College has become increasingly out of reach for 
poorer Californians, a trend Wilson has contributed 
to with his Senate votes. 

On the problems faced by migrant workers, WiJson 
has consistently sided with Central Valleyagribusi-
ness in union/ management legal disputes, opposes 
the United Farm Workers' grape boycott and spon-
sored a wholly inadequate seasonal workers program. 

Wilson, in short, is a traditional Republican with a 
few exceptions. (He deserves credit for his longstand-
ing and continued support of the Equal Rights 
Amendment). 

While he joins the drumbeat against drugs and 
talk.s about GOP tax breaks for the wealthiest one 
percent of our popUlation, California has serious 
problems that need addressi'ng now. 

McCarthy is the man who will address those 
problems. 

Freshperson? 
Have you noticed freshmen on the women's soccer 

team or coming out of the women's room in dorm 
suites? 

Arts Editor Sabrina Youmans' Editor in a Box 
commentary (GUtlrdian, Oct. 10) provoked a staff 
discussion about the Guardian s use of language. Our 
policy is to be non-sexist, but we continually come up 
against one especially vexing usage,freshmen, to refer 
to everyone in their first year of college. We know the 
word he doesn't mean she, and man doesn't mean 
woman. 

We have made the small and admittedly awkward 
change fromjreshman to jreshperson. Our search for 
alternatives led us to some interesting places . 

Disappointed Muir Writing T As report that many 
students consider the program's commitment to non-
sexist language trivial. They don't want "morality 
legislated," Peter Mortenson of the program told us . 

If men were ask.ed to think of themselves as an 
afterthought , included in groups with female titles, 
you can bet those objections would vanish . Men 
wouldn't stand for being part of womankind, work-
ing as postwomen or firewomen or getting workwo-
mens compensation after a job injury. Women 
shouldn't take it either. 

Studies have shown that given the allegedly gender-uni-
versal sentence, "The student reads his book," stu-
dents of both sexes will almost always picture a man. 

If you have any alternatives to jreshperson, any-
thing that sounds better ',vithout calling women men, 
write us a letter and let us know.

Regent Election 
Not a New Idea 
Editor: 

We are indebted to Elaine Brooks 
for her excellent and insightful opin-
ion "Speech is Restricted for UCSD 
StaW' (Guardian. Oct. 10). It is refresh-
ing to know that, at least every once 
in a while, someone on StafTis willing 
to speak out with the candor and 
honesty which Ms. Brooks displayed 
in her writing. 

I would, however, like to indicate 
one possibly misleading comment of 
Ms. Brooks' when she said : "1 think it 
apocryphal both for your [the Guor-
dian:r] effort, and for this campus 
that the issue [of the election of the 
Regents] was generated at Berkeley 
and not here." 

In 1978 the California State As-
sembly Committee on Higher Educa-
tion met on this campus to discuss, 
among other things, issues related to 
the development of Interdisciplinary 
Programs. 

DUK~KIS QESOrlTS TO THE F~BLEO "DUrlAN DEFENSEII 

During the meeting, according to 
the former Student Assembly Co-
Chair Montgomery Kroopkin, a large 
coalition of campus student groups 
concerned with the state of autonomy 
of the University raised the issues of 
the accountability of the Regents to

A Lesson in 
The Real World 
By MIKE MARTINEZ 
Contributing Writer 

This is the fourth entry in the Editor-In-A-Box saga. 
So far, our Ed-in-Chief John Shaw has shown a sly, 
cynical side, like another John who's been in the news 
lately - Lennon. Jeff B.-Howe, offered his personal 
experiences with sex and love that flows. Sabrina 
showed she is capable of bearing children and I, for 
one, take her seriously. She runs one hell of a section. 

Before this becomes an elongated office in-joke, let 
me say that I'm quite honored to have been asked for a 
contribution. I'm not like the others. I'm a full time 
staff member, on salary with UC Regents and the 
Guardian business office. I'm not even an editor per se. 

The real editors are students, most of you barely 20 
or just past it . The lofty academic standards here are 
enough of a burden without factoring in the twice 
weekly Guardian Deadline Blues. Some of you also 
have part-time jobs. 

In spite of the obstacles, all of you should enjoy your 
college years. They're a time to get outrageous, a time 
for headlong dives with your eyes closed, a time for 
friendships and perhaps that first great love. Year 
from now you'll long for these days, which will seem in 
retrospect 0 carefree . You may even remember them 
a the Fun Years. 

I've been throullhaU that. I'm over 30. My life isa lot 
like that TV show, ThirtY$Omething. I've crossed that 
great divide into the Real World. Let me aive you all 
the benefit of my expertise with a brief treatise on the 
six concepts youll need a grasp of in the Real World. 

I. Connectlom. Bear with this rude awakening. I 
graduated from San Diego St . .even years ago this 
December with a degree in Graphic Communication 
and a minor in partyology. I waltzed into the obligatory 
graduation buh with boundless optimism, a fistful of 
dreams ... and more than a little arropnce. 

Just what makes that littk old ant think he can move 
that rubber trn plont? 

Hell, I thought the line on my resume that said 
Graduate was a codocil to the Ten Commandments. It 
wasn't. The best and smartest way to further your 
career is to establish connections. This may be the 
biggest challenge of your life if your name isn't Quayle 
or K.olender. 

Think of coMections as a flow chart. Start with a 
friend, relative, or mailman. Someone you know. After 
that, it's who-knows-who-knows-who and the chart 
starts to branch out. You do a lot of bullshitting and' 
cold call introductions, but that's how the system 
works. I wu once interviewed by an agency owner who 
was the golfing buddy of a friend of a friend's neighbor. 
You can't always count on the want ads. 

2. Cut down (or out) recreational spirits ... wink, 
wink, nudge, nudge. Come on, you know what I mean. 
Smokin, a joint is going to feel and look dumb at some 
point, so why wait for the inevitable? As for cocaine, 
that guy on the Atlanta Falcons would straighten you 
out if he were here. Those of us in the Real World stick 
to the Friday night six-pack. 

3. Marriage. This could be considered optional, and 
I know many men and women who've had successful 
careers as professional singles. I married Sandy last 
year, and I'm pretty happy. You don't want to end up 
like my mom's uncle, who's 80 years old, lives alone in a 
low rent room downtown, and has no one to nag him. 

4. Money. Directly related to No. I. This includes 
everything that revolves around income and your 
standard of living. You'llearn how to budget, how to 
dve, how to invest. You'l need to know how, when 

and where to buy a house. You'l decide how much of

Senator Quayle admitted that he

Following his grandmother's 
counsel, he'd certainly have made 

a super cheerleader if he'd been 
born a girl. However. with a good 
chance of finishing up in the

Pub Closes Amid 
Controversy 
By TAMARA MUHONEN 
Slaff Writer 

On March I, 1989, the students 
and faculty of UCSD will say 
farewell to an old friend . UCSD 
will close the doors of the Triton 
Pub when the new Price Center 
opens. Round Table Pizza parlor 
will take over the Pub's role as the 
only place to buy alcohol on 
campus. 

and manager of the Triton Pub, 
Maryanne Davis has seen its 
popularity grow steadily. 

"The Pub is a happy place," she 
commented. "The kids love to 
come here to let off steam." 

A huge sign posted at the 
entrance of the pub says, "We 
aren't your·mother." This attitude 
adds a lot to its popUlarity. 

"There are not a lot of no-no '5, .. 
Davis explained. "This is a place 
where students can come to relax 
and regroup." After jail release under military regime, Chilean comes to UCSD. According to University Plan-ning Committee chair Tom 

Tucker, relocation of the pub is 
an answer to "how to best meet 
the interests and needs of the 
students ... 

The open and friendly atmos-
phere of the Triton Pub has drawn 
a large variety of customers, 
including athletic teams, fraterni-
ties, and students who just come 
to study. 

Refugee From Chlle 
A 1983-84 student survey of 

2,000 students reported a desire 
for an on-campus pizza parlor. 
The planning committee, com-
prised of thirteen members (eight 
of which are students) considered 
this and other factors when decid-
ing where to place the pub. 

In the end, the committee 
decided to keep the pub close to . 
the bulk of other eating estab-
lishments. With the opening of a 
number of restaurants in the new 
University Center, they decided 
relocation of the pub to the Uni-
versity Center made sense. And, 
Tucker said, "Pizza and beer go 
together. .. 

Unfortunately, what the student 
survey failed to relay were the sen-
timentalties held to the pub. Dur-
ing her past six years as owner 

"I've seen people come in on a 
wild, packed Friday night and set 
up a chess match," chuckled Davis. 

Bids for the pub space in the 
new University Center were open-
ed in 1987. A sub-committee for 
food 5ervice selection then chose 
the new vendor from the bids 
submitted. Even though the op-
tion to bid was open, the man-
agement of the Triton Pub chose 
to abstain. 

"We're a small business," ex-
plained Davis, "The new student 
center is made of big, corporate 
chains ... 

"I have mixed emotions about 
the situation," Davis continued. 
"I like it here, and I think we will

When the group above was asked how they felt about the pub 
closing, they answered, "It sucks."

have left our mark. But, the new 
students who have never been to 
the pub will never know we were 
here. We will only exist in the 
minds of the older students as a 
memory of'a Friday afternoon in 
the pub.''' 

In the end, the bid went to 
Round Table Pizza Parlor. Ac-
cording to Jim Carruthers, direc-
tor of the University Center, the 
location of the pub is the only 
thing changing. 

"We're simply moving the con-
cept of the pub to a new facility," 
he said. 

This issue, however, has sparked 
controversy. Triton Pub advocate 
Bryant Karras commented, "I like 
the atmosphere at the Pub, and 
I'm not so sure that a pizza place 
will be able to recreate that same 
type of atmosphere." 

wThrowing parties at the Pub 
has been a tradition for us. 
Because Round Table is a fran-
chise, I don't know that the owners 

will be quite so open about rent-
ing it out to us," Paul Maurani, 
president of the UCSD Ski Club 
(RISC) said. 

The relocation of the pub will 
allow the current location, in the 
University Center "satellite" (the 
old Student Center), to be rented 
by the 200-plus student organiza-
tions for parties, meetings, or 
other group functions. 

According to Tucker, the pos-
sibility of maintaining two on-
campus pubs was not a considera-
tion. 

WBccause ofthe bonuses created 
by relocation, it would work as an 
injustice to the students," he said. 

According to Carruthers, di-
rector of the University Center, 
the issue of additional liquor 
licensing was not a factor. 

"There was no desire within the 
planning committee to have more 
than one pub," he said. "The con-
sumption of beer and wine on 
_campus is not all that great." 

Neil McConlogue, doing a hand-
stand, said, "Why not just let 
Round Table sell pizza here at 
the pub?"

10 Monday. October 17. 1988 NEwS 
CO UN CIL:Proposals Rejected 
Continued from pale 1 
ing of the upcoming reggae fest. 

Both measures were defeated . 
The meeting also featured a 

visit from a group of Soviet col-
lege students from Leningrad 
State University. 

Finlan's proposal, the "Student 
Input in Campus Policies Resolu-
tion," would have urged the 
UCS D administration to reverse 
amendments to a UCSD policy 
document dealing with student 
rights. 

Finlan contends the amend-
ments have been made improp-
erly, without regard for required 
student participation in the revi-
sion process. 

Student members of the cam-
pus committee charged with rev-
isi ng the document, Finlan said, 

were not appointed by past A.S. 
Councils. 

"The A.S. is more 
concerned with co-
vering up mistakes 
than with student 
rights." 

-Bard-Alan Finlan 

"What we're talking about 
here," he said , "is the most impor-
tant thing regarding student rights 

that this council could have ad-
dressed. " 

Many council members agreed 
with Finlan in principle, but 
opposed the resolution. 

"The people who were assigned 
to this committee [in the past] 
didn't even show up,"V.P. Admin-
istrative John Robison said in an 
impassioned speech against the 
resolution. "Student input has 
always been sought. To ask them 
to take away this entire policy is 
ridiculous ... 

A.S. President Maynard Dim-
mesdale was one of the few voices 
on the council supporting the 
resolution. 

The resolution failed three to 
eight with six abstentions. 

"The A.S. is more concerned 
with covering up mistakes than 

student rights," Finlan said later. 
"They are sending a very clear 
message to the administration that 
we don't care about doing our 
job." 

The proposal by Public Rela-
tions Commissioner Tom Rhee 
for off-campus reggae fest adver-
tising also generated considerable 
council debate. 

Rhee wanted to advertise the 
show in the Reader, an idea 
strongly supported by Program-
ming Commissioner Jonathan 
Judaken. 

"It's not just a concert," Juda-
ken said. 1Reggae) is a message 
that has got to get to the people." 

Judaken stressed that prepar-
ations for the Untouchables BGIF 
appearance were poor, but said 
that preparations for a large turn-
out for the reggae fest have been 
made. 

"We've actually got more se-
curity than we had for the Sun 
God Festival last year, when we 

The UCSD Guardian 

had 4,000 people," he said. 
However, off-campus advertis-

ing ran into strong opposition 
from Dimmesdale and others. 

"I am opposed to using student 
funds to promote events for the 
outside popUlation, .. Dimmesdale 
said. "It was also mentioned to 
me by Jonathan that this would 
be advertised through 91 X ... we're 
talking about a tremendous 
amount of advertising." 

ludaken confirmed the 9 I X 
connection, but noted that it was 
at no cost to the A.S. and had 
therefore did not require council 
approval. 

Funding for the ad was voted 
down two to twelve, with five 
abstentions. 

"At this point in time, I think 
we ought to play it safe and not go 
for the Reader ad, Third College 
Senator Gayatri Gunasekaran 
said . "I think it's going to be fine 
just with us - I mean, we can 
party!"

the garrison had ordered that 
they would be given lunch. '" 
thought, oh no, now they are 
going to poison us, and so I did 
not want to go." she said. The 
three ate lunch with soldiers sur-
rounding them and ensuring they 
did not speak to each other. 
Although the food was not poi-
soned, Abilla-Arenas said she 
"definitely thought that poison-
ing was one way of getting rid of 
people .. .it was a nightmare, to 
say the least." 

One time she was released from 
the garrison to return to her 
school, but as soon as she began 
teaching her class, the door would 
open and soldiers would be there 
telling her she had to go."The stu-
dents were just shocked. Some of 
them screamed and took issue 
with the military and others were 
just very much in support (of the 
military)," she said.

normal procedure of one soldier 
pointing the way while anolher 
followed her with a bayonet at her 
back. She had almost reached the 
foot of a staircase when she saw 
they were bringing the other 
teacher down. 

"They were dragging her, she 
was a mess, all bleeding. They had 

"I was called for interrogation 
every single day for almost two 
weeks until I was put before the 
military tribunal and sentenced to 
be in jail," Ubilla-Arenas said. 
For reasons she still does not 
understand, she was allowed to 
trade the jail sentence for house 
arrest if she could find someone

to bail her out. 
Finding that someone, however, 

was difficult, when no one wanted 
to help a person associated with 
the Allende government, because 
to harbor an Allende supporter 
was risky. Finally, the principal of 
the high school where she taught 
English and French bailed her 
out. 

House arrest was "a very tedious 
kind ofthing," Ubilla-Arenas said. 
She was fired from her job and

because she had nothin, to do, 
and was afraid to write anything 
down because of the military's 
searches. She had no other source 
of income. except help which 
began to arrive from her friends

HARASS: 
A Campus 
Problem 
Continued rrom pale 1 
and have trouble understanding 
why they are not doing well in 
class. Juarez acknowledged that 
students sometimes feel they are 
imagining things. 

"They have a cognitive prob-
lem, much like the child abuse 
victim who complains of adult 
fondling," she said. 

Many victims who seek coun-
seling feel very powerless in their 
situations;' but Juarez said that 
the road to recovery begins when 
victims realize that they have the 
power to be in control of their 
own lives. 

"A victim feels doomed if she 
says no and doomed if she gives 
in." she said, "It's a matter of 
being in touch with their own 
assertiveness. " 

The psychologist explained that 
the victim's feeling of helplessness 
is a common reaction typical of a 
school environment. 

"Students go to school to learn 
to be efficient, competent and 
able adults il\ control of their 
lives. When a person in power 
tries to take over, the victim expe-
riences a feeling of helplessness, " 
Juarez said. 

Yet the problem of harassment 
is not only prevalent among stu-
dents and teachers, but also exists 
among students. 

A common situation is when 
two students who have been dat-
ing each other experience a break-
up and one of them continues to 
pursue the other, 

Juarez said that anyone who is 
continually coming up to another 
person against their will is consi-
dered a harasser. 

"This is easier to solve because 
you'rc dealing with someone at 
your own level and this other per-
son is not evaluating you." she 
said. 

Juarez said that often a victim's 
problems can be resolved without 
having to press official charaes· 
However, the decision to go ahead 
with filing a formal complaint 
rests with the student. 

"I can' tell people what to do. 
My role is simply to clarify wtylt 
the student wants and support 
them," she said. 

.Ii S/udent:S Guide 10 Sexuol 
Harassmenl, a pamphlet put out 
by the Student Safety Awareness 
Program, suggests that in order 
to file a formal complaint, stu-
dents must contact a complaint 
resolution officer. 

Undergraduates should contact 
the pro\lOsts of their college and 
graduate students should go to 
the dean at the Office of Graduate 
Studies.

Continued from pale 10 

It did not matter. With 20:09 
still on the clock, Craig Gross 
booted the ball from deep in 
UCSD territory. Chris Hanssen 
was there to receive the pass, and 
shot it sailing past the goalie and 
into an empty goal box:. 

This revved up the Triton 
offense and excited already rowdy 
fans. The small, but extremely 
vocal crowd on hand was enjoy-
ing the fast paced action on the 
field . 

With their adrenalin still pump-
ing, the Tritons attacked again. 
Chris Waage sent the ball across 
the field to Carrick Brewster, who 
found an opening and scored the 
Tritons' third and last goal ofthe 
day. "They were leaving it open 
the whole game,ft said Brewster. 
"We just didn't get all our chances 
in." 

Coach Derek Armstrong was 
pleased with the win. "They're 
from New Y or k . . . we didn't know 
what to expect. It wasn't a smooth

Tritons Upset William & Mary 
in Women's VoUeybaU 

By A.C. LEE 
Contributing Writer 

Competitive, young and willing 
to improve were the words Coach 
Doug Dannevik used to describe 
his national number one (Div-
ision III) ranked women's volley-
ball team, as they continued their 
q uest for "the drive for five" 
national titles Friday by beating 
WiJliam cl Mary. 

After a grueling week of prac-
tice, the Tritons came into Fri-
day's match against 13th ranked 
(Division II) William & Mary 
(16-1) as heavy underdogs. Over-
coming their fatigue, the Tritons 
played a three hour marathon 
which they dramatically won at 
the end, 14-16, 1S-13, 1S-12, 10-15 
and 1S-9. 

played really well over the three 
hours, but our depth of substitu-
tion was the key factor," senior 
Ellen Chi pointed out. 

A few players who had out-
standing performances were Ra-
chel Vetter with 18 kills, Dana Si-
mone with 24 digs, and Lauria Ber-
tanyi who played setter through-
out the entire five games. "Laurie 
was there every time we needed 
her to be solid," Dannevik said. 

Dannevik said that tbe team 
made great strides with Friday's 
win, broke through its plateau 
and made improvements in their 
style of play. 

However, the next day the 
Tritons played Division III La 
Verne and 10lt in straight sets, 15-
13, 1S-13 and 16-14. The defeat 
ended UCSD's 41 match winning 
streak apinst Division III teams 
which bepn way back in October 
of 1986. 

Palmer (13) ducks as Bigelow (10) slams one for UCSD. 

A deciding faetor in Friday's 
pme was UCSD's defense, which 
compiled a high 117 digs to Wil-
liam cl Mary's 53. Anotberfaetor 
for UCSD was its continual rota-
tion. "In general, our defelllC 

Tuesday tbe Tritons will travel 
to face Chapman in a 7:30 p.m. 
pme.

PHIL'S PRIME PICKS

The World Series 

Spread 
No spread 

Underdog 
LOS ANGELES 

PHIL'S ANALYSIS . . . Oh goody. Kirk Gibson hits a 
home run with two outs in the ninth inning of Game 
One to beat the A's, 5-4. Whoopee. Big deal. Let's get 
serious: this World Series is ajoke. It would have been 
one thing if the National League had given the A's a 
Major League team to face, but no. It gave them the 
Dodgers. So what if L.A. won the first game? So what 
if they win games two and three (they won't anyway, 
but the A's might decide to let them win a few just to 
make it exciting). It doesn't really matter, because 
Oaktown is gonna rock them in the Coliseum as soon 
as the Dodgers realize that they can't hit. At all. Oh, 
and another thing: I agree with Don Baylor on most 
points, but what he said about Jay Howell I just have 
to disagree with. It's not that Howell can't pitch under 
pressure, it's that he can't pitch at all. As a matter of 
fact, he sucks. It's probably pretty clear that PHIL 
wants you to ... take the Dodgers to finish fifth in the 
National League West next year and for right now . . .

UCSD Water 'Polo Clobbers 
Claremont-Mudd, 14-5 

By CHRIS ZAHARIAS 
Contributing Writer 

Rebounding off a tough loss to 
USC here on Friday, the men's 
water polo squad crushed visiting 
Claremont-Mudd 14-4 Saturday 
night. The victory raised UCSD's 
record to 12-9, and gives the Tri-
tons momentum for their upcom-
ing game against sixth-ranked UC 
Irvine next Friday. 

From the outset, it was clear 
that the Stags from Claremont-
Mudd were not match for the 
Tritons powerful offense, led by 
sophomore Jason "Turtle" Brown 
(6 goals) and junior Dave "Bus-
ter" Calder (5 goals). 

In the first period, UCSD 
wasted no time in asserting its 
dominance when Brown scored 
only 15 seconds after the sprint. 
This goal followed a patient pass-
ing assault around the outside. 

The Tritons also controlled the 

defensive end of the pool. even in 
one-man-down situations, with 
Claremont-Mudd converting a 
mere third of their 6-5 opportuni-
ties. At the other end, however, 
UCSD made the best of its man-
up situations, as it capitalized 
two-thirds of the time. 

On the way to shooting SO per-
cent for the evening, several Triton 
players connected on a number of 
tough shots. In the second period, 
Calder, with one arm in the grips 
of a defender, managed to hurl 
the ball past the Claremont-Mudd 
goalie from no more than two 
meters out. 

Again in the second, the Tri-
tons got the ball with only thirty 
seconds remaining, but still man-
aged to put togeher a flawless 
passing attack. Freshperson 
Joseph Risse capped it off by 
scoring on a powerful skip shot 
from the far left with just seven 
seconds left. 

Another good performance was 

turned out by senior goalie Randy 
"The Franchise" Franke, who 
blocked many shots from the mid-
dle as well as the perimeter. The 
same could not be said for the 
Claremont goalie, however, who 
was aptly named "Holy Goalie" 
by one fan. In fact, the whole 
Triton team disposed of the Stap 
in a systematic fashion. 

On the subject of upcomina 
games, Harper said, "We'l crush 
Pomona-Pitzer, so we're traininl 
through that game to get ready 
for UC Irvine. They'l be a good 
test for us." 

The defeat of Claremont-Mudd 
came on the heels of a thorough 
wipeout of Washington and Lee 
University earlier that day, 14-3. 
Calder also scored five goals in 
that game, giving him ten on the 
day to help the 10th-ranked Trit-
ons win their II th and 12th games 
of the year. 

The Tritons host Pomona-
Pitzer at Canyonview Tuesday at 
3:30 p.m. 

Women's Soccer Stays Undefeated 
by Beating Westmont, 4-1 

By DANA CHAIKEN 
Contributing Writer 

Although the UCSD women's 
soccer coach thought his team felt 
"a bit of pressure" going into 
Saturday's game against West-
mont College, it only exerted pres-
sure on the visitors' defense as the 
Tritons extended their record to 
14-0-1 with a 4-1 victory. 

Coach Brian McManus attrib-
uted the pre-game pressure to the 
fact that a win over NAIA West-
mont (2-11) guaranteed his 
charges a spot in the Division III 
playoffs. "That was the main thing 
today," he explained afterward. 

After a fruitless occupation of 
Westmont's territory throughout 
a majority of the first half, Ste-
phanie Savoy tapped in a goal off 
a beautiful left-to-right cross by 
Katy Duloek to start the game's 
scoring at 30:09. 

Barely two minutes later, the 
scoring continued when West-
mont tallied what several players 
and spectators could only des-
cribe as a "ridiculous" goal. 

Triton goalie Julie Freiss, hav-
ing not practiced the day before 
because she had the flu, let her 
string of six consecutive shutouts 
literally slip between her hands. 
To her own disbelief, Freiss com-
mitted what McManus called "her 
first mistake ofthe year," and lost 
the chance to have her 13th shut-
out in fifteen games as the ball 
dribbled between her legs into the 
net. 

UCSD, apparently ignoring 
their opponent's bit of luck, 
"relaxed at the end of the first 
half,"mueh to McManus'dislike. 
He did, however, approve of the 
effort by midfielder Sheila Taka-
hashi, who is still recovering from 
an injury. McManus honored her 
with the compliment that "she 
had as good a first half as you're 
going to see." 

He seemed to get his group of 
mostly juniors and freshpersons 
fired up again at halftime, claim-
ing, "We were more aggressive in 
the second half. We didn't let 
them play." 

His estimation proved an under-
statement as the Tritons com-
pletely dominated the second half, 
allowing virtually no Westmont 
player except goalie Shelley 
Sprague to touch the ball. UCSD 
fired lion-target shots, most of' 
which came late in the half when 
Westmont finally buckled under 
the extreme Triton offensive pres-
sure. 

"I was confident we would 
score, even if we had to go to 
overtime. There was no way we 
could take that many shots and 
not score," asserted McManus. 

Felicia Faro, after a tremend-
ous demonstration of ballhand-
ling, sent a cross-field pass to a 
waiting Heather Mauro, whose 
shot barely cleared a diving 
Sprague to end the scoring 
draught at 82:17. 

Mauro, whom McManus 
wanted to substitute for just 
seconds earlier but wasn't 
acknowledged by the referee, des-
cribed her eleventh goal of the 
season as an "end to the frustra-
tion we felt because we were out-
playing them." 

"It shows this team can come 
back. We came together well when 
we needed to," she added. 

The Tritons continued to shell 
Westmont's goalie, scoring two 
insurance goals in the next two 
minutes, after Mauro's go-ahead 

and game-winning goal opened 
the gates. 

Substitute forward K.arin 
Lindsay, one ofthe team's spark-
plugs, chipped the ball up and 
over the goalie off an assist by 
Mauro. "She stayed calm when 
most players would have wanted 
to cream it," McManus said. 

Katy Dulock broke the school 
record for goals in a season, tally-
ing her nineteenth on nothing leu 
than a perfect shot. On an assist 
by Toni K.rumme, she lifted the 
ball from 20 yards out on the right 
side into the upper left corner of 
the goal to finish the game's scor-
ing. 

On having her record sur-
passed, Mauro simply expressed. 
"whatever it takes to get to the 
playoffs." 

"I think we've got a shot at 
winning it all. We've lot to go at 
it. We'ljust have to do it in their 
backyards [St. Thomas or St. 
Mary's, both of Minnesota]," 
McManus predicted about his 
team's chances. 

For now though, McManui 
knows that the team "has to con-
centrate on the four games left 
and carry a good winning attitude 
into the pla)lOffs." 

The Tritons host Chapman 
College Tuesday at 2:30 on 
Warren Field.
