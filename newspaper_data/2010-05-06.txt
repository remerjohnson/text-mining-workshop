Talks Fail to 
Bring About
Compromise

By Angela Chen
News Editor

The A.S. Campus Affairs Committee voted 
7-8 last night to indefinitely table a controversial 
resolution calling for the UC system to divest 
from General Electric and United Technologies 
— companies the document claims are profiting 
from alleged Israeli human-rights violations in the 
Palestinian territories.

Because the resolution was tabled during the 
committee meeting, it was not brought up during 

the council meeting last night, and 
will not be brought up again next 
year unless the resolution is rewrit-
ten and submitted as a new item. 

Campuswide Senator and A.S. 
President-elect Wafa Ben Hassine, 
a member of the committee, said 

the issue was tabled because councilmembers 
thought it was repetitive to vote on an issue that 
had not changed since the prior debate. 

“People used the rhetoric that we’d been 
through the same discussion last year, and since it 
was the same legislation, we didn’t want to go over 
it again,” Ben Hassine said.

Arts and Humanities Senator Omar Khan said 
he originally wanted to re-discuss the resolution 
at last night’s meeting, but withdrew it because he 
worried it would divide the campus.

“I tried to pull it from committee because I was 
unaware that this is an issue that could be brought 
up again,” he said. “I withdrew the motion because 
I realized that failing it or approving it would create 
a schism between the communities, and we want 
to continue the conversation.”

The resolution was first proposed at last week’s 
meeting, which drew an audience of over 200 
students. During that meeting, councilmembers 
amended the original resolution to remove any 
mention of specific nations or companies, revising 
it to state that the council should condemn all war 
crimes in general. A special committee was then 
charged to review the resolution. It included rep-
resentatives from both SJP and Tritons for Israel, 
the latter of which opposed the original language.  

SJP member Leena Barakat, who helped draft 
the original resolution, said the two groups were 
unable to agree as to whether Israel’s actions in 
the Gaza Strip could be considered human rights 
violations, or whether Israel should be classified as 
an occupying force.

<ZIKS The university may opena three-year graduationpathway. By Elena Chang
The University of California may cre-ate a formal pathway for undergradu-ates to complete their degrees in  three years, based on a suggestion by the UC 
Commission on the Future. While the proposal is 
still in early planning stages, proponents of the idea 
say that a defined three-year program could help 
students save money, as well as alleviate decreased 
enrollment by letting in more undergraduates.

According to the Commission on the Future 
— a group of administrators, faculty and students 
charged with reviewing the university’s operations 
and drafting proposals to help overcome an $813 
million cut in state funding as of Spring Quarter 

2009 — helping students complete their degrees 
earlier could potentially save them thousands of 
dollars in student fees. The report also states that 

facilitating a “defined three-year 
pathway” to graduation will allow 
more spaces to open up for new 
students to enroll, thus increasing 
overall accessibility. 

The report estimated that if 5 to 10 percent of 
undergraduate UC students graduated one quarter 
or semester earlier, approximately 2,000 to 4,000 
undergraduate spaces would open up.

You can finally can your ProActiv 
subscription: Bioengineering graduate 
student Dissaya Pornpattananangkul is 
developing a new acne treatment that 
utilizes the compounds derived from 
coconut and human breast milk, but 
lacks the usual side affects associated 
with current acne drugs.

Pornpattananangkul, who works in 
the Nanomaterials and Nanomedicine 
Laboratory, said she is experimenting 
with a “smart delivery system” that 
could treat acne by directly delivering 
potent molecules of lauric acid — a 
compound proven to stop the bacteri-
um that causes the skin problem — to 
the site of irritation. 

“Our main goal is to prepare 
nanoparticles with lauric acid in order 
to kill bacteria that cause acne vul-
garis,” Pornpattananangkul said.

The “smart delivery system” is 
made up of liposomes — microscopic 
sacs that act as carriers —filled with 

lauric acid. The liposomes are attached 
to gold nanoparticles, which help 
locate acne on human skin based on 
characteristics of the skin such as pH. 
This way, lauric acid can be applied 
directly to the source. 

“The delivery system will allow 
us to deliver several molecules of 
the drug to acne at the same time,” 
Pornpattananangkul said. “That will 
cause an even more effective way to 
kill bacteria.” 

Approximately 85 percent of teen-
agers and over 40 million people in 
the United States are affected by acne. 
The lack of side effects of many drugs 
now available such a benzoyl peroxide 
include crusting and blistering. 

These side effects are drasti-
cally reduced when lauric acid is 
applied. Since the compound is 
a natural product found in both 
coconut oil and human breast milk, 
Pornpattananangkul says it offers a 
safe alternative to the commercialized 
acne treatments currently available 
and is less likely to irritate the skin 

while killing off the bacterium causing 
inflammatory acne.

The project began when 
Pornpattananangkul, nanoengineering 
professor Liangfang Zhang and gradu-
ate student Sage Olson teamed up with 
a group of researchers from the divi-
sion of dermatology.

“We discovered that lauric acid had 
the ability to kill bacteria effectively,” 
Pornpattananangkul said. “Once we 
knew that this worked, we wanted to 
improve it even more by improving 
the delivery system.”

Although the project has been 
in progress for almost two years, 
Pornpattananangkul said that there is 
no finalized ending date.

“We do not plan to ‘get it done’ 
because we plan to improve it as much 
as we can,” Pornpattananangkul said. 
“For example, first we get to prepare 
one nanoparticle. After that one is 
done, we do another nanoparticle that 
releases the drug inside the lesion only, 
but not outside. There are a lot of ways 
we can improve our system.”

Though the group is currently 
focusing its research on lauric acid, 
they are also exploring other fatty 
acids that could potentially fight acne. 

“We are also interested in combi-
nation therapy [where we] combine 
our drugs and other drugs in the 
market to one nanoparticle to reduce 
the toxicity of those market drugs,” 
Pornpattananangkul said.

“They couldn’t agree that inter-
nationally recognized, document-
ed human rights violations have 
occurred,” Barakat said. “They tried 
to play it off as opinion. They have 
accused these organizations  — United 
Nations, Amnesty International — of 
bias, and they have made it clear that 
they don’t believe in unconditional 
human rights.” 

TFI member Lior Abramson said 
the issue is unrelated to whether a cer-
tain group recognizes Israel’s actions as 
human rights violations. 

“I think the wording of the resolu-
tion implied that if you weren’t for 
it, you didn’t support human rights, 
and that’s not true at all,” Abramson 
said. “I support human rights, I don’t 
know anyone who doesn’t, but we can-
not support divestment from a com-
pany that supports the Israeli Defense 

Forces, which are what keeps our 
friends and family safe back home.” 

She added that TFI has not yet 
taken an official stance on whether 
“occupancy” is an accurate word 
to describe Israel’s actions in the 
Palestinian territories.  

“The committee didn’t work 
because our goals were mutually exclu-
sive,” Abramson said. “As a gesture, 
since no student fees directly go toward 
investment in Israel, it is anti-Israel — 
and we are a pro-Israel community.” 

SJP member Chris Westling said 
that multiple students in the TFI com-
munity have expressed support for the 
resolution. 

“There are at least 15 campus orgs 
that support our cause, and a very 
small number of one — one that’s 
fragmented anyway, and one in which 
many members support our resolution 
—  which is essentially exercising veto 

power,” he said.
TFI member Daniel Friedman and 

Abramson disagreed with Westling’s 
claim. 

“As with all good Jewish communi-
ties, there’s a lot of opinions and a lot of 
things going on,” Friedman said. “But 
at the end of the day, when we sit down 
and discussed it, everyone came to the 
same consensus. On the TFI executive 
board, there were different opinions 
voiced, but it’s a democratic thing. We 
voted, and what came out of the vote 
is what was represtend by the elected 
officials at committee.”

Abramson said that, though there 
may be individual disagreements with-
in TFI, the group itself remains united.  

“We are 100 percent unified on 
this issue,” she said. “Of course, people 
have individual opinions, but we have 

Finance and Resources-elect Andrew 
Ang, along with Mania Magazine 
Editor in Chief Rose Eveleth.

Quarterly publications will now be 
limited to a hard $4,000 per quarter, 
and annual publications will be eli-
gible to receive a maximum of $6,000 
per year. However, cheaper publica-
tions will be required to stay within 
10 percent of the quarterly average 
of their 2009-10 allocations, unless 
special circumstances arise — such as 
an increase in pages per issue, or more 
frequent distribution dates. The new 
guidelines state that funding requests 
exceeding the 10-percent margin must 
be defended by three quotes from 
competing printer companies. 

Ang said the revisions are in 
response to over-allocations that 
occurred under the council’s previ-
ous system. In the beginning of the 
year, the council set aside $45,000 for 

media-org funding, but subsequently 
overallocated by over $20,000. 

“The original system wasn’t really 
a cap — just suggestions that people 
could choose not to follow,” Ang said. 
“This has concrete numbers on how 
much money each organization gets 
per quarter.” 

Ang said the new limits are based 
on operating costs reported by the 
organizations over the last several 
years.

“We looked at the allocations over 
the past few years — both for publi-
cations that published quarterly and 
publications that published annually 
— and saw that the allocations per 
quarter per org ranged from $3,000 
to $5,000 dollars for quarterly, and 
$6,000 to $9,000 for yearly publica-
tions,” Ang said. “So that’s how we 
came up with those cap numbers.”

Under the new guidelines, quar-
terly publications will receive $12,000 

a year, but yearly publications will only 
be able to receive $6,000. Ang said this 
was because yearly publications typi-
cally only print a few more pages than 
quarterly publications. 

“Yearly publications don’t print the 
equivalent of all the quarterly publica-
tions once a year,” he said. “They print 
once, with less content, but typically 
higher quality.”

Eveleth said the new guidelines 
emphasize fiscal responsibility by 
requiring all organizations to pres-
ent three price quotes, ensuring they 
receiving a fair price.

“We took out production dead-
lines, partially because they’re some-
what arbitrary, and every publication 
is different in that no publication pub-
lishes on the same schedule — and 
sometimes things fall through, and 
if you can’t publish on schedule, you

This year’s outgoing A.S. coun-cilmembers celebrated their last council meeting last night, 
tying all loose ends left over from ear-
lier in the year. 

For the second time in two weeks, 
a large public audience showed up at 
the meeting. To avoid crowding, the 
discussion was relocated to the Price 
Center East Ballroom.

For its first 
order of business, 
the council argued 
over whether it 
should allow con-
stituents — who 
came to address 
council over the 
controversial divestment resolution — 
to speak during a public-input period. 
The line for the podium was long, 
and councilmembers who agreed that 
last week’s discussion was unproduc-
tive — namely, AVP Academic Affairs 
Jordan Taylor — argued that an 
unmoderated conversation wouldn’t 
go anywhere.

The council passed a motion to 
listen to every person in line, but after 
an hour and a half, it seemed that 
both Israel supporters and Students 
for Justice in Palestine representatives 
remained divided over the issue.

Senior Adam Teitelbaum pleaded 
for more cooperation between the 
two groups. 

“I want to talk about improving 
the lives of all global citizens,” he 
said. “I am pro-Israel, I am also pro-
Palestine, and I am pro-peace. Let’s 
open up the lines of communication 
— there is suffering on both sides.”

During her member report, 
President-elect Wafa Ben Hassine 
expressed discontent with the coun-
cil’s deliberation over whether to 
accommodate all members of the 
public wishing to comment on the 
divestment resolution. 

“If the public makes an effort to 
come out to meetings, then I’m will-
ing to stay here all night to listen to 
them,” Ben Hassine said. 

She might be the only one.
Members of the Da Real Punjabiz 

dance group asked council to give 
them $6,000 for traveling expenses to 
a May 8 competition.

Sound familiar? A few weeks 
back, the UCSD 
ZOR dance team 
asked for a similar 
amount for travel, 
and was acqui-
esced.

Vice President 
of Finance and 

Resources Peter Benesch scolded the 
council for setting an irresponsible 
fiscal precedent. 

“Bad financial decisions costs you 
tens of thousands of dollars, but does 
get you reelected,” Benesch said. 

The vote to fund the dance team’s 
latest travels passed 16-7-5.

Vice President of External Affairs 
Gracelynne West gave a number-
heavy presentation on the 2010-11 
UC Student Association budget. The 
proposal included adding a full-time 
media and communications direc-
tor to staff and opening an office in 
Southern California..

In a rather lighthearted presenta-
tion, Advocate General Parminder 
Sandhu described the attendance of 
associate vice presidents in one word: 
atrocious. He submitted 11 impeach-
ments this year, two of which were 
passed by the council.

Councilmembers also voted to 
establish a stipend for senators. Those 
in the position next year will receive 
$10 per week.

Campuswide senator Tobias 
Haglund presented his A.S. Store 
budget to council, and — after much 
debate — the council passed it.

I have too much stuff.I have two calendars on my  wall, 31 pairs of underwear in my 
closet drawer and 11 scarves hanging 
on my three overworked wall hooks. 
Between my closet, my purse and 
my car, I have taken on the personal 
task of storing about 40 old Guardian 
issues. A giant bag containing every 
piece of schoolwork I’ve ever com-
pleted in college sits in my hallway 

closet. I own approximately 26 pairs 
of shoes. 

I wouldn’t call myself a 
“Hoarders” hotshot, but that’s still a 
shit-ton of stuff. I’m really not sure 
how I accumulated it all, but here’s 
my guess:

Over time, humans have evolved 
to rely less on their bodies and more 
on their brains. As a result, we’ve 
accumulated a set of life accesso-
ries, which we must have with us at 
all times. At the dawn of mankind, 
these possessions were fur pelts and 
sharpened rocks; today, they take the 
form of smart phones, credit cards 
and bags — thousands and thousands 
of bags.

Plastic bags, in particular, are 
perhaps the most omnipresent thing 
in the modern household — the con-
tainer/vehicle of all fringe doodads. 
In my immediate line of vision, I 
can currently see two: The first is of 
the Geisel, book-toting species and 
the second a thin-skinned CVSer 
wrapped around my trash can. 

But I know there are more. As 
the cockroach of the modern liv-
ing space, the plastic bag nudges 
its way into a home’s every crevice 
and almost immediately multiplies. 
When I brush my teeth tonight, they 
will stare at me from the bathroom 
cupboard. When I make break-
fast tomorrow morning, they will 
threaten to spill from a basket near 
the microwave. Wherever I am, there 
they are.

You can hide or discard the thin 
waxy demons, but you can never kill 
them altogether: Plastic bags take 
up to 1,000 years to decompose in 
a landfill. The receptacles I toted 
my groceries home in last Thursday 
will outlive me. They will outlive my 
children. They will outlive my grand-
children.

And, in a country whose citizens 
use about 50 to 80 billion plastic 
shopping bags a year, it’s no surprise 
I can’t escape them. With such power 
in numbers, they need a place to go. 
For a long time, they seemed only to 
settle for highway gutters and land-
fills — but recently, they’ve recently 
been sighted blizzarding through the 
streets of China, floating north of the 
Arctic Circle and conferencing with 
other waste in a garbage patch way 
out in the North Pacific.

While their ubiquity is by no 
means welcome, I have little idea 
how we could possibly fight a move-

In response to budget cuts, the university may institutionalize 
the most ambitious of  collegiate feats: the three-year degree. 
But the option would inevitably cheapen all of  our degrees. 

Many of us here at the University of California tend to regard our-
selves as pretty damn intelligent. 
We openly flaunt the difficulty of 
our course loads, complain loudly 
about any sub-par grade we hap-
pen to receive (read: ‘B+’) and 
brag with enthusiasm about the 
number of hours we’ve gone with-
out sleeping during finals week.

But even the most self-
involved of overachievers are 
downright impressed upon 
learning that a peer intends to 
graduate in three years. It’s a sign 
of superior organizational abili-
ties, exceptional work ethic and, 
in many cases, a distinct lack of 
social skills. 

No matter how many college 
alcohol parties one has to skip to 
get that diploma early, the hard 
work is paying off in a big way 
— in the form of a whole year of 
tuition. And while a select few 
students have been independently 
pursuing the three-year option 
for as long as there have been 
universities to graduate from, the 
fringe benefits that would come 
from instituting this ambitious 
pathway are just now registering 
on the university’s radar. A group 
of administrators tasked with 
solving the pressing UC financial 
problems recently recommended 
that the three-year squeeze be 
adopted as an official academic 
program — a move designed to 
free up space for incoming fresh-
men while launching college 
graduates into the workforce at a 
faster rate. 

It sounds like a decent enough 
prospect: Take an existing option, 
institutionalize it, give it a fancy 
name (something like “UC in 
Three!”) and shuttle students 
through the system at breakneck 
speed. 

Unfortunately, it’s not that 
simple. In order to ensure that 
students on this official three-year 
path graduate on time, they’d be 
offered priority course enrollment 
status, thereby placing regular 
four-year students at a disadvan-
tage once WebReg season rolls 
around. And what if you sign for 
the three-year plan, lose steam 
and drop out? Then you got all 
that priority privilege without 
earning it.

What’s more, the program 

would likely also require par-
ticipants to enroll in  summer 
courses each year — a condition 
that basically eliminates the whole 
“save money by graduating early” 
thing. Sure, summer school is 
cheaper, but not by a lot. 

The recommendations for the 
program also suggest that these 
summer courses be taught by 
non-tenured faculty and teaching 
assistants. Translation: lower-
quality instruction for nearly the 
same price you’d be paying during 
the regular school year. Though 
it’s not unheard of for TAs to take 
on more than they should, insti-
tutionalizing cheap labor to such 
an extreme degree would come 
at a significant life cost to those 
enrolled in the classes.

As we mentioned, the pro-
gram would have its benefits 
to the university: more room 
to enroll new students, lower 
instructional costs and the 
“streamlining” of a few general-
education courses (sketch). Take 
note: the most significant benefits 
of this program are benefits to 
the university, not to students. 
Applicants admitted to the three-
year fast track would be getting 
an inherently hastier education, 
meanwhile cheapening the UCSD 
degree for all of us.

And the university knows it. 
As if to confirm our greatest res-
ervations about the plan, the UC 
Commission on the Future’s list 
of recommendations mentions a 
few of the negative impacts the 
program would have on its par-
ticipants, including “less time to 
develop interpersonal skills” and 
“fewer options available within 
the curriculum due to scheduling 
restrictions.” Meaning they’ll be 
even less equipped with liberal-
arts well-roundedness than they 
already are, and they won’t likely 
be able to change their major 
once they’ve shaken on the deal.

No doubt about it: Desperate 
times call for desperate mea-
sures, and the three-year plan 
would be a no-cost way for the 
UC to become more accessible 
to California students. Any way 
you look at it, though, the plan 
will translate to a lower-quality 
education. And once we’ve set 
that precedent, UC history will 
tell we’re unlikely to restore what 
was lost.

DRAWING FIRE By Johan DeLaTorre

Lock Your Doors: The Big, Bad Bag Is After Your Family 

 
Dear Editor,

In the past year, you have probably 
created about 1,700 pounds of trash. 
So did everyone you know and every-
one they know. 

However, there is one man who 
decided to reduce that number to 
zero: Colin Beavan, also known as No 
Impact Man, made it his project to 
reduce his impact on the environment 
to nothing. His is an extreme effort, 
but Beavan demonstrates the courage 
and initiative that we should all take.

After seeing the documentary 
produced by Beavan, also titled “No 
Impact Man,” my house — H-House, 
in Muir College — was inspired to see 
what changes we can make in our lives 
to reduce our impact on our planet.

 I am writing to encourage all of 
you to take part in this challenge with 
us. For the next week, my housemates 
and I will give up eating meat, using 
the elevator, driving, creating trash 
and wasting water. 

Although some of these actions 
may be difficult, the point is not to go 
cold turkey. Rather, we are trying to 
find out which eco-friendly behaviors 
we can accommodate in our lives. 

I urge you to take a refreshed 
look at the way you live by trying this 
experiment with us. We owe it to our 
community to take this first step on 
the way to living in an eco-friendly 
and sustainable way.

Freshman, Muir College

Dear Editor,
In her April 26 article entitled 

“Unequal Pay for Equal Labor,” 
Kelsey Marrujo applauds the govern-

ment for “standing up for” the stu-
dent against internship exploitation. 
Marrujo applies dubious arguments 
in support of further labor regula-
tions, including appealing to emo-
tion by pointing at the rise in tuition 
costs. 

While I admit that a paid wage 
is far more lucrative than an unpaid 
internship, regulation does more 
harm than good. The decision to 
accept an internship is voluntary. As 
such, the student enters the contract 
aware of the conditions. Contracts 
can be broken if such an action 
behooves the student. Any claims 
that internships represent a form of 
exploitation are clearly nonsensical.

 Regulating internships will hurt 
the student because it will inevitably 
decrease the availability of intern-
ships. Businesses will no longer offer 
positions if they are coerced into 
paying their interns, and, as a result, 
they will deny students valuable 
work experience. This means that 
the few fortunate enough to have 
interned will have advantage over 
those that did not, thanks to state 
regulation.

Before jumping the gun and 
berating employers for exploiting 
students, let’s remember that all 
internships are voluntary in nature. 
It follows that unpaid internships are 
indeed advantageous to the student.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Students Should Reduce 
Environmental Impact

the ways of responsible consump-
tion: My reusable, eco-friendly bag 
lays dusty and neglected beneath a 
pile of (you guessed it) plastic bags, 
and I often forget to request that my 
purchases be sacked in paper. 

But even if I did, how many 
more people would need to do the 
same for the plastic shopping bag 
to go extinct? How can we elimi-
nate a species we so enthusiastically 
created when our reliance on its 
ephemeral function is still so instru-
mental? How, in the first place, did 
we develop such a flimsy, disposable 
item with such incredibly resilient 
materials? Why do sea turtles mis-
take them as food? Is a sea turtle’s 

eyesight really that bad?
I don’t want to get all conspiracy-

theory on you here, 
but I think they 
might be after us. 
You probably all 
think the manmade 
invention that’s going 
to enslave us is the 
computer, but I’ve 
got news for you: 
Computers can’t fly 
like ninjas. Plastic 
bags can. And they 
will. Once they’ve 
decided there’s not 
enough room on the 
planet for both of our species — and 
that time will come sooner than you 

think — they will storm our civili-
zation like they did that one street 

in “American Beauty.” 
But instead of looking 
whimsical, they will 
suffocate your young. 

So, be wary of those 
innocent-looking sleep-
ers peeking from your 
kitchen drawer. Poke 
holes in them to hin-
der their gift of flight, 
and/or recycle them 
at Whole Foods while 
we wait for the immi-
nent showdown. In the 
meantime, you know 

what to do next time the store clerk 
asks, “Paper or plastic?”

Think you missed the boat on the

HPV vaccine?

Think Again

If you didn’t get the Gardasil vaccine as part 
of your childhood immunizations, it’s not too 
late. Planned Parenthood now offers free or 

low-cost Gardasil for women who want to 
significantly reduce their risk of getting 

HPV, the leading cause of cervical cancer.

The report also states that if a UC 
student graduated even one quarter 
earlier, he or she could save an esti-
mated $8,895 — though this figure 
does not account for the cost of the 
additional summer courses a student 
would be required to take as part of the 
three-year program.

The three-year degree program, 
though still in its planning stages, 
would require participants to enroll in 
mandatory summer school, “stream-
line” their major and general-educa-
tion requirements and choose a major 
before attending a campus. 

“What you can do is you can ask 
that programs look at their require-
ments and see if there’s a way that 
they can maintain the quality of their 
degree in a way that can compress that 
into three years, including summer 
offerings,” Bruce Schumm, a mem-
ber of the Education and Curriculum 
Working Group for the UCCF, said.

The university would guaran-
tee three-year participants early 
class selection and course availabil-
ity. Some general-education require-
ments might also be waived in order 
to ensure that all  classes could be 
completed within three years.

“For people who have the capabil-
ity and interest in finishing in three 
years, the vectors for doing so are 
not in place, and so the idea was to 
look into the possibility of offering … 
certain degree areas more amenable to 
that,” Schumm said. 

Although the three-year degree 
would be available at all UC campuses 
if implemented, each campus would 
be able to regulate certain components 
of the program independently, such as 
which majors would be offered on the 
faster track and how much flexibility 
would exist in class selection. 

“The UCOP would direct the cam-
puses, but either way it’s implemented, 
it will certainly be implemented at the 
campus level,” Schumm said. “So we 
might decide to implement something 

here in a slightly different way than, 
say, Berkeley or Irvine might.”

However, Schumm added that the 
effort required from departments to 
create a “streamlined” major may ulti-
mately cost too much to be practi-
cal, especially since the university will 
bring in no profits from this program, 
according to the UCCF report. 

“In the end, it may be more 
effort than it’s worth,” Schumm said. 
“There’s no guarantee that you achieve 
these efficiencies or improvements in 
quality.”

There is also no guarantee that stu-
dents will be interested in such a plan. 
According to an academic counselor at 
Warren College who wished to remain 
anonymous, most students who wish to 
graduate in three years instead choose 
to pursue a double major.

“There are pros and cons to gradu-
ating in three years,” he said. “It’s 
beneficial to students who are ready. 
Some students need more develop-
ment. Four years is important for self-
exploration — if you shortcut that, 
you may have to catch up later, which 
may be harder to do.”

In 2002, only 2.5 percent of all UC 
undergraduates graduated in three 
years or less, compared with the 53.3 
percent who graduated in four years, 
and the 22.6 percent who graduated 
in five years. An additional 3.9 percent 
of students took six years to graduate.

“For freshmen — or students 
that come in as freshmen — there’s 
very, very few who ever graduate in 
three years,” a representative from the 
UCSD Office of Student Research and 
Information said, who also wished to 
remain anonymous. “The last time I 
think we actually published it was back 
in 1996; for years and years, the num-
ber was 1 percent, or less than 1 per-
cent, so we just stopped publishing it.”

get a hard time,” Eveleth said. “I think 
that most media orgs are in favor of 
it. I personally talked to a few media 
organizations, and they said they read 
it and were happy with it.”

A.S. President Utsav Gupta said 
he thought the cap was set too high. 

“It might not seem like a lot of 
money individually, but $4,000 under 
our overall count is only enough 
to fund five media organizations a 
quarter, and if you want to fund all 
of these with this cap, that could 
be $60,000,” Gupta said. “I know it 
might not seem popular, but we have 
limited sets of resources and we can’t 
allocate like that — which is why I 
would ask for additional reflection 
on the cap.”

Eveleth said the number was 
meant as an extreme, not the aver-
age amount of money allocated. She 
stressed that the data came from fig-
ures previously collected by the A.S. 
Council. 

“The $4,000 number comes from 
the actual data in the past,” Eveleth 
said. “If we set the cap any lower, we 
would be hurting the major newspa-
pers on campus.”

The new guidelines also allow 

student media orgs to request fund-
ing for one additional issue during a 
quarter they did not originally request 
money for — though the request 
may not exceed $3,000. Powers said 
this allows for emergency issues to 
be released under last-minute cir-
cumstances, such as Winter Quarter’s 
Black Student Union crisis. 

According to Ang, there may be 
exceptions made if organizations 
wish to request more money. Either 
the AVP of Student Orgs or Vice 
President of Finance and Resources 
—  the position Ang will take next 
week —  would be able to allocate 
more money as needed. However, 
Ang said he would recommend that 
the cap not be broken. 

“The AVP and VP can extend 
beyond these rules, but it has to be 
a specific circumstance,” Ang said. 
“They have to come in and show 
proof to the SOFAB that you have a 
publisher — show us your budget, 
your plan, your number of pages — 
before we’ll allocate more than the 
cap.”

Eveleth echoed that more money 
would be handed out only in specific 
circumstances,.

One example of a publication with 

a high start-up cost is No 15 Magazine, 
which received nearly $9,000 in stu-
dent fees to print 3,000 copies of its 
first issue. No 15 Magazine Editor in 
Chief Kevin Nguyen acknowledged 
that, if his organization had tried to 
request funding prior to these chang-
es in policy, it would have hindered 
their publication process. 

“We could’ve still had something 
printed out, but it would be a lot 
harder to get started,” Nguyen said. “I 
think it definitely puts a little strain 
on new publications, because starting 
up is really tough — especially if you 
don’t have enough funds for it.”

However, Nguyen said he is in 
favor of the new funding cap, and 
supports the flexibility the new sys-
tem offers to startup publications. 

“There definitely needs to be 
some regulations about that, because 
people can be requesting so much 
money here and there,” he said. “But I 
think that keeping the startup money 
— allowing new publications to start 
up — is a great thing. I think it’s defi-
nitely fair what they did.”

a board that decides for the group, and 
if anyone was angered by our decision, 
they would have left and not been in 
our group.” 

A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Enterprise Operations and SJP mem-
ber Rishi Ghosh said he wishes to 
see the council continue pursuing the 
issue.

“My idea toward the council is that 
you can run but you can’t hide,” he 
said. “Good things have happened, and 
I’m excited to further work with the 
pro-Israel community, but I’m confi-

dent that people will continue to work 
for this.”

Friedman said the indefinite 
tabling of the resolution is a welcome 
end to the debate.

“It’s not the ideal thing, but it’s what 
[the committee] decided,” Friedman 
said. “Hopefully now the communi-
ties will start working together to have 
conversation about the topic and bring 
them together.”

Ghosh said it is possible that a 
similar resolution will be proposed to 
the 2010-11 council, which takes office 
next week.

“It might have more success next 
year with a new council, if those new 
senators are willing to read the legisla-
tion and not just listen to the rhetoric 
surrounding it,” Ghosh said.

Abramson said that TFI will con-
tinue to oppose the divestment resolu-
tion if it is reintroduced next year.

“If this resolution comes up next 
year, TFI will keep coming out and 
speaking out against it,” Abramson 
said.

I t seems that, in the time since my “Compton Cookout: The Musical” column debuted last quarter, the 
real-live UCSD theater department 
(pardon, thee-tuhh) may have caught 
onto my whole “art heals pain” plan. 
(See “Real Art, Real Pain,” below. And 
get a load of that LGBT crochet magic.)

It’s OK; I’m not jealous. This just 
means the final act in my winter-
quarter irono-drama needs to blow the 
fucking roof off Galbraith Hall.

As you probably don’t remember, I 
left the M.A. Fox piñata hanging from 
the rafters in Act Two — levied by 
dependable sidekick Penny Rue (that’s 
vice chancellor of student affairs, to 
you). They exist in a pool of light on 
the right third of the stage. One of Rue’s 
hands is holding the rope, the other an 
oversized bullhorn — into which she 
screams, “Done! Done! Done!”, her 
burgundy centipede mouth rippling in 
waves of heartsickness.

That’s when a second pool of light 
blinks on, onto the next third of the 
stage. A group of giggling girls in skirts 
and berets are skipping there, using 
a length of green rope (what the hell 
kind of rope is green?) to play double 
Dutch. If the berets haven’t tipped you 
off, these are the vis-arts geniuses who 
got a little too creative with their scrap 
pile on the seventh floor on Geisel 
Library one fateful Tuesday.

Now the second pool of light starts 
blinking, because everyone knows it’s 
not an art party without a strobe. But 
the girls soon grow bored, despite the 
cool slow-mo effects the rope is mak-
ing in front of their fickle pupils, and 
take to the next pool over, where they 
begin to wind the rope around the

B e forewarned: This Friday, flash-mob dancers and dudes in bizarre costumes might 
block your daily route to Geisel 
Library. The Arts in Action Fes-
tival is open-air performance 
to make you look — a daylong 
event in which students, alumni 
and faculty will align the fights 
against prejudice toward blacks, 
Latinos, women and homosexu-
als.

Beginning at 2 p.m., theatri-
cal pieces on the history of the 

movements will unfold at various 
locations: the Triton Steps, the 40 Years 
Legacy Mural at Peterson Hall, the 
Women’s Center and the LGBT Center. 
At 3 p.m., participants will move to 
the Silent Tree before marching to the 
Mandell Weiss Theatre for an interac-
tive “Opera of Meaning” (bring your 
laptop or iPhone) and open forum. 
Followed, of course, by a dance party 
at 8 p.m.

“Arts in Action came about because 
a few of us sat down and said, ‘We 
believe that this campus needs a place 
for its artists to respond to the racial 
emergency and events of last quarter,’” 
event organizer Heather Ramey said.

At Mandell Weiss Theatre, a stu-
dent mural will be collaged with a 
live mural created by Chicano artist 
Mario Torero, while a fence you can 
play like a harp stands by. Full-body 
knitted masks by Master of Fine Arts 
student Zac Monday (left, right) will 
be displayed during the gay-rights 
performance at the LGBT Center. 
And, just to make sure we don’t doubt 
the “multi” in this media, the festival 
will also feature a series of musical, 
spoken-word and digitally interactive 
performances, along with live coverage 
by SmashTV.

“I really hope students will attend 
the event, come with their own ques-
tions, keep on working on these ques-
tions and keep thinking about the role 

of art in constructing and decon-
structing social identities.” artistic 
director Jade Power said.

According to Power, festival 
organizers drew inspiration from 
UCSD’s history of radical protest 
art, which included body bags full 
of bloody animal parts strewn across 
Library Walk during the Vietnam War.

“The performances are to remind 
students about the power of bodies in 
action, the links between performance 
and politics and to highlight the chal-
lenges faced and successes achieved via 
protest throughout history,” Power said. 

Ramey said she realized the 
importance of documenting UCSD’s 
charged past during the sit-in at the 
Chancellor’s Complex in February.

“The [Black Student Union] 
alumni association came by and 
said, ‘You know, we were here 
before you doing this stuff. You 
weren’t the first,and you’re not 
going to be the last.’” Ramey said.

W ith a soft tempo and sincere sensitivity, Canadian super-group 
Broken Social Scene’s fittingly 
named Forgiveness Rock 
Record becomes the optimal 
soundtrack for a moody 
onset evening. Dramatic 
song titles, unassuming sonic 
textures and open-heart 
sentiments scream formu-
laic breakup album, but the 
care with which understated 
vocals are laid over the new-
age folk beat — devoid of 
the whine so common in 
choked-up emotional en-
deavors — creates a cohesive 
whole that’s more genuine 
feeling than forced connec-
tion.

Album opener “World 
Sick” begins with a single 
guitar string, plucked and 
plucked again, an acid tear-
drop on the band’s history of 
soul-consuming shoegaze. 
But then they arrive: the 
drums, followed by syn-
thesizers, all building to a 
charged chorus of electric 
guitar with an explosion of 
cymbals behind it. Despite 
the natural disaster in the 
background, lyrics are never 
tempted away from straight-
forward — even when 
addressing the complications 
of chronic lovesickness. By 
omitting the show of lyri-
cal selfishness so common 

in breakup ballads, “World 
Sick” instead lets a talented 
group of players become the 
internal earthquake behind a 
frail, hurting human voice.

But they also know 
when to break the trend. A 
persistent buzzing kicks off 
album highlight “Sweetest 
Kill,” soon joined by a two-
note bass track that sends 
itself rollicking. The bal-
ance is reversed: This time, 
background noise is sparse, 
while the vocals warble and 
echo, drawing out the last 
disillusioned note of a failed 
relationship. 

“Water In Hell” similarly 
tips the balance the band has 
so carefully cultivated — but 
doesn’t betray the heartsick 
theme — by launching into 
a state of denial. It begins 
with a twangy, country 
intro completely devoid 
of TLC. Nasally vocals are 
overwrought, senseless 
inanities (“From what I can 
tell/ There’s water in hell”) 
shouted onto a numbing 
backdrop.

In a much kinder man-
ner, the rest of Forgiveness 
proves that Broken Social 
Scene can be the introspec-
tive therapists we need in a 
rough patch — and some-
how, we still feel cool.

B.o.B.
The Adventures of Bobby Ray
ATLANTIC RECORDS

B o.B. may have hit his claim to fame stringing together niceties about a gal who pays 
her taxes and keeps a gangster’s 
eye from wandering, but instead 
of filling debut The Adventures 
of Bobby Ray with likeminded 
good-guy tracks, newcomer 
Bobby Ray Simmons pulls a 180 
with a genre-straddling album 
that packs more juice than we 
ever would have imagined.

B.o.B’s devotion to home-
hitting topics like hope for fame, 
success and love won’t have 
hip-hop’s big dogs rehashing their 
battle raps to keep up anytime 
soon, though. When B.o.B busts 
out his best Kanye impression 
alongside Jay-Z on the Top 40, it 
only serves to expose the 21-year-
old’s relative inexperience.

It even happens on his own al-
bum. Hitmaker Eminem injects a 
gold-clinching rage that cripples 
B.o.B’s comparatively flimsy verse 
on “Airplanes, Part II,” while T.I.’s 
rapid-fire cameo guns down the 
new guy’s self-conscious ego trip 
on “Bet I.”

Bobby Ray may play up 
the pauper-to-prince angle to 
cringeworthy extremes, but the 
beats on bottom make up for 
every second. “Don’t Let Me Fall” 
showcases an appreciation for 
rock ‘n’ roll, as B.o.B pleads for 
advice from the screaming cords 
of an electric guitar.

Throw in a shout-out to indie 
chart-toppers Vampire Weekend 
on “The Kids” and the beautiful 
pain of Paramore frontwoman 
Hayley Williams on “Airplanes,” 
and it’s obvious that the rapper 
isn’t feeling pressured to find a 
niche — yet isn’t overrreaching 
either, a la Lil Wayne’s latest hard-
rock endeavor.

While the excitable sense of 
variety is certainly admirable, it 
does occasionally come across 
as schizophrenic. But the boy’s 
got guts — and the game always 
rewards those willing to lead the 
pack.

B.o.B. will perform live at the 
Sun God Festival on May 14.

The Mack ‘N Biz
Just the Tip
UNSIGNED

I f normal-dude jokester Asher Roth had the guts to take himself seriously, 
he might sound something 
like the Mack ‘N Biz. UCSD’s 
own nerdcore hip-hop duo 
is about to release their first 
full-length mixtape, Just the 
Tip — and while the album 
may be more filler than killer, 
they do show off the chillaxed 
type of honesty and slick, 
popped-collar production 
that no gimmick group could 
hope to pull off.

On tracks like “Fuck 
Class,” Andy Mack and AJ Biz 
bring a frat-boy swagger to 
the macho sensibility that has 
too long been the province of 
grim-faced gangstas owning 
the genre. It’s the album’s 
standout track, full of shou-
touts to campus landmarks 
like Porter’s Pub and that one 
weird-looking guy who works 
at the parking office.

The duo struts through 
verses, trampling a sea of tri-
umphant synthesizers: “Fuck 

class, I don’t wanna do that/ 
I just wanna get high and 
rap.” Their direct approach 
is admirable, and when they 
pull it off, the complete lack 
of self-consciousness is a 
powerful contrast to clowns 
like Roth.

The stuff about love, 
though, becomes embarrass-
ing: “Electric Bitch” brings 
ghetto misogyny to the 
suburbs, while “Dreamin’ 
Bout You” could only be 
meaningful to a 14-year-old. 
Their venture into politics 
fares no better, with “State of 
the Union” mired in cliche, a 
whiny tirade against capital-
ism and George W. Bush, the 
easiest asshole to hate on the 
face of the Earth.

Ironically, their most 
mature songs are about the 
most immature topics, like 
the technicalities of getting 
fucked up. Now that’s a rap 
we can relate to.

HIATUS� THURSDAY, MAY 6, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN�9

chancellor like a lopsided Maypole.
(This, of course, makes it difficult 

for whoever is playing Rue. Ever tried 
maintaining a sympathetic centipede 
mouth with a bullhorn in one hand 
and a baited fishing line in the other?)

Seeing as the second pool of light 
now goes unmanned — a strobing 
party one at that — the hairy “ungrate-
ful nigger” in the poncho runs back out 
to centerstage, this time struggling to 
drag one fat side of a refrigerator box 
along with him. It’s taller than he is, 
with “Compton lynching” written on 
it in Comic Sans — because, of course, 
that’s the mock-handwriting font of 
choice for all those still living in the 
“post-racist” utopia that is a kindergar-
ten classroom. (You know, where the 
only person you’re prejudiced against is 
the fool who wiped snot on the Lincoln 
logs? Those were the days.) Poncho 
man finally lifts the king-sized scrap 
above his head with a grunt of satisfac-
tion, yelling, “If you don’t read I’m-a 
read it in a couple of seconds!”

This is where we’re going to need 
some ballerinas. They can be shitty 
ones, though. And all we’ll need to play 

A.S. President Utsav Gupta is another 
superstar piñata, silhouetted by a final 
pool of light on the far left, frozen in 
pirouette above a circle of chairs. The 
A.S. councilmembers, scattered around 
the podium, are wearing gray politician 
suits five sizes too big, back-alley nego-
tiator hats that flop over their eyes and 
clown-sized dress shoes with ballerina 
tips. Extra black, for solidarity. They try 
to find their spots for a few minutes, 
but — thanks to the hats and square 
toes — end up a discombobulated 
swarm of “’scuse me” and “motion to 
find a chair” and “check your boner 
off my hipbone” and snaps (to make 
themselves known). Sort of like Marco 
Polo, if no one ever knew whose turn it 
was. Or how to swim. In the deep end.

You’ve been very patient with me. 
Here is your reward: the grand finale. 
The rectangular snake of protestors 
returns from Act Two, still dressed 
all in black but for their orifices. The 
noose girls — who have been going all 
S&M on the M.A. Fox piñata — scam-
per off, and the angry block systemati-
cally begins to pummel the chancellor 
with a set of matching bats, chanting 
“We need to know!” at the bits of tis-

sue paper that fly from her frail paper-
mache skeleton. “Done! Done! Done!” 
shrieks Rue on the other end of the 
rope, her caterpillar mouth more of a 
sin wave on psychedelics by now. 

A small way into the beatdown, 
cash starts pouring from the Fox. (OK, 
that’s wishful thinking. In reality, all we 
found in the piñata was a feast of com-
mittees. What a shitty party.) That’s 
when Koala man gets an idea: He pulls 
a spare keyboard from his poncho and 
starts putting his best sloshball slugs 
into the Gupta version. Score! Pennies 
flow like pain. Peripheral members of 
the protest mob flood stage left, getting 
in wherever they fit in.

Only one thing could truly put the 
shit in this storm, and it’s called March 
Forth. Hundreds of students, loaded 
in Strike Barbie accessories, rush the 
stage to shout “Gay!” “Broke!” “Bored!” 
“Ahhh!” until it all blends into one 
causeless roar. The strobe takes over 
the stage, the tech guy says “Fuck it” 
and spews his whole stock of lasers on 
that bitch, and the audience joins in for 
a game-ending dance party. Because 
that’s how this thing should go down. 
See you at Sun God, beautiful people. �����

cheekers rampant in the comic-turned-
film’s first installment. 

In “Iron Man 2,” Stark is caught 
in the middle of a legal clusterfuck, 
fast-talking his way out of handing 
the Ironman suit over to a concerned 
U.S. government working in conjunc-
tion with opportunistic sleazeball 
Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). Stark 
boldly claims that no one could pos-
sibly stumble upon similar technology 
within the decade. How wrong he is.

Just days later,  muscle-bound 
Russian Ivan Vanko (an electrifying 
Mickey Rourke) whips the superhero 
around in a suit made with identical 
technology. The rivalry comes to a 
head at Stark’s Expo, culminating in a 
metal-crunching standoff that makes 
for one hell of a shrapnel show.

It takes a special type of swagger 
to turn iron to gold — and Downey’s 

performance as the iron-hearted Stark 
does just that. Charming and snarky, 
Downey is a winner alongside Paltrow, 
exchanging high-speed banter and 
throwing self-indulgent parties at 
which he gets smashed and dances like 
a baffoon. Downey plays up Stark’s 
fallibility, breathing life into a hero so 
frequently described as godlike.  

Antagonists Rourke and Rockwell 
never fade from view, either. Rourke 
growls in good Russian — spitting 
blood, peppered with metal — and 
Rockwell verbally bombards anyone 
unfortunate enough to fall into his 
greasy web of egomania.  Even store-
mannequin Scarlett Johansson is 
surprisingly well -placed, deadpanning 
throughout as taciturn, bra-flashing 
badass Natalie Rushman.

Bolstering the cast, director Jon 
Favreau keeps the special-effects team 
to the grindstone as well, churning out 

streaming lighting blasts and enough 
gasoline-packed explosions to power 
Stark’s Audi. The effects are engaging 
enough to capture even the girliest of 
filmgoers, filling the void left by the 
nauseating plotline of metal-mashing 
giant “Transformers 2.” 

But “Iron Man 2” has its sharp 
edges. Favreau makes little effort to 
forge any new ground in the way of 
unexpected twists; Vanko’s thirst for 
vengeance on his family’s behalf is 
exhaustively expected. Though the 
flimsy storyline is lacking the kind 
of weight delivered by “The Dark 
Knight,” the film’s colossal effort in all 
other departments nearly irons out its 
shortcomings. And for those hanker-
ing for more hot iron-on-man action, 
be on watch for the clip that rolls after 
closing credits — looks like the next 
Marvel film is already being ham-
mered out.

SPORTS� THURSDAY, MAY 6, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

Jon Klingensmith from Colorado 
Christian.

Going into the final two events of 
the season, Oksaki admitted his per-
formance had been sub-par as of late. 
UCSD’s lead man throughout the sea-
son, Okasaki’s final-stretch struggles 
peaked on the 7,100- yard Classic Club 
course, where he shot above his season 
average of 75.1 strokes in all three 
rounds.    In his third year on the 
team, Okasaki followed up a stellar 
sophomore season with a solid junior-
year campaign. The golfer tallied a 
pair of top-10 finishes at the Sonoma 
State Invite and the 60th Annual SoCal 
Intercollegiate in March. Despite a 
strong string of tournaments during 
the middle of the season, Okasaki 
struggled toward the end, finishing 

outside the top 20 in each of UCSD’s 
final three tournaments.    

During the 33-year tenure of head 
coach Mike Wydra, UCSD has quali-
fied at least one golfer for the regional 
event every year, but nationals remain 
elusive.

With the majority of the roster 
returning next season, the Tritons 
appear poised to break that streak. 
Oksaki, senior Raj Samra and junior 
transfer Richard Morris will lead 
UCSD into next year’s season, while 
Wydra will spend the offseason trying 
to solve the same problem he has faced 
all season: finding consistent play in 
the fourth and fifth spots on the start-
ing roster.

seven innings, allowing three runs on 
eight strikeouts. His performance was 
more than enough for the Tritons to 
seal the deal at 8–4. 

Rossman said the series was an 
encouraging end to the regular sea-
son, but added that the team still has 
unfinished business. 

“I thought we clicked really well 
in the SFSU series,” Rossman said. 
“We threw, hit and fielded very well. 
It was a good weekend to finish up 
the regular season and head into the 
postseason on. This time of year is 
what we strive for, what our goals are. 
We’ve achieved one goal: winning the 
CCAA. We’re not satisfied, and still 
have two more goals to accomplish.”

The Tritons will now aim to 
win CCAA tournament, where 
Cal State Dominguez Hills, Chico 
State University and Cal State San 
Bernardino will all be in attendance. 
Over the regular season, the Tritons 
went 4–0 against CSU Dominguez 
Hills, 2–2 against Chico State and 2–2 

against Cal State San Bernardino.
For the first round of the CCAA 

Tournament, UCSD will face Chico 
State on May 6 in Stockton. Lee said 
the Tritons’ pre-match preparation 
this season has been the key to their 
success.

“We are preparing for the playoffs 
the same way we have prepared for 
every other weekend of games,” Lee 
said. “I have said this before, but we 
focus on quality of practice. I attri-
bute my personal success to confi-
dence and trusting my preparation.”

Rossman agreed with his catching 
partner.

“We’re not doing anything differ-
ent for playoffs,” Rossman said. “We 
just went about our business as usual 
today, with a normal practice. We’ve 
worked real hard as a group. We’ve 
earned everything we’ve achieved, 
and we’re just taking it a day at a 
time.”

seen since 2001 with a 30-20 record, 
and four members of the team earned 
All-California Collegiate Athletic 
Association honors. However, despite 
their efforts, UCSD finished the season 
sixth in the league, failing to qualify for 
postseason play.

On the upside, the team had its 
standouts: sophomore right-hander 
Camille Gaito was selected as co-pitch-
er of the year and earned a spot on 
the All-CCAA First Team, along with 
junior outfielder Kris Lesovsky and 
senior catcher Nicole Sauari. Freshman 
infielder Nicole Spangler was selected 
to the All-CCAA Second Team.

“The season did not end on a good 
note because we expected to go to the 
playoffs, but even though it was disap-
pointing, I have no regrets,” senior 
captain Saari said. 

Because there were many under-
classmen members on the team this 
year, junior infielder Sarah Woofter 
said there was not enough time for 
them to learn what it takes to be a 
playoff team.

“Nobody wanted the season to end,” 
Woofter said. “But we need to learn 
from it and use it as a learning season.” 

The Tritons started off the season 
on a winning spree, but faltered down 
the stretch. At the end of March, the 
Tritons were holding a 23-11 record 
and third place in the conference; how-
ever, they went just 7-9 in April, and 
fell out of the playoff race during their 
final weekend of play.

The Tritons consistently struggled 
with hitting consistency and bringing 
in runs in the earlier innings of games 
throughout the season: Five of their 
victories required them to come from 
behind.

The Tritons were, however, able to 
improve their defensive game, com-
mitting fewer errors per game as a 
team than last season. The Tritons also 
posted a season-best nine-game win 
streak between March 5 and March 
26, finishing the month with a 15-3 
record.

Individually, Saari ranked third in 
school history with a fielding percent-
age of .991, and came in second on the 
team this season in doubles, runs bat-
ted in, total bases, on-base percentage 
and slugging.

As the true stars of the season, 
the team’s pitchers — Gaito, senior 
right-hander Christine Zankich, junior 
right-hander Brittany Sheats and 
sophomore right-hander Tess Granath 
— wreaked havoc on opposing hit-
ters. The staff combined to post a 
conference-leading 1.96 ERA, holding 
opponent hitters to a .265 batting aver-
age and totaling nine shutouts (eight of 
which belonged to Gaito).

The Triton offense could not con-
sistently provide its excellent pitching 
staff with adequate run support, with 
the team ranked just sixth in the con-

ference in both batting average and 
runs scored.

Lesovsky was a bright spot in the 
Triton offense, finishing with a .413 
batting average, 10 home runs and a 
perfect 1.000 fielding percentage.

Junior infielder Jennifer DeFazio 
said team members respect each other 
as equals — regardless of age and 
experience — and now know what 
it will take to make it to the playoffs 
next season, with all but three players 
returning.

“Through all the struggles we go 
through everybody has the same goals 
in mind, and we need to just work 
harder individually and as a team to get 
ready to go as a full force,” Woofter said.

HOTCORNERTHIS DAY IN HISTORY
In 1915, Boston Red Sox pitcher 
Babe Ruth made his pitching 
debut and hit the first home run 
of his career against the New York 
Yankees. Boston lost 4-3 to New 
York in 15 innings.

The senior was ejected three times (removed temporarily for 
rules infractions) in UCSD’s 10-7 victory over Sonoma State on 
April 30 in the quarterfinals of conference playoffs. She set the 
school record this season with 19 single-season ejections.

GOLF — On May 5, junior Keith 
Okasaki almost became the first Triton 
golfer to qualify for the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Division II National Championship. 
But after tying for 65th place in the 
NCAA D-II Central/West Regional 
in Palm Desert, Calif., Okasaki didn’t 
quite make the cut.

As he qualified for the regional 
event as an individual, Okasaki needed 
to finish as the top individual who 
was not a member of a team already 
advancing to nationals to qualify for 
the tournament. His three-round total 
of 16-over par, 232 put him 13 strokes 
behind national qualifiers Patrick 
Boag from Western Washington and 

The Tritons followed a fiery month of March — during which they
  won 15 of 18 games — with a lackluster 7-9 record in April
               to finish sixth in conference and narrowly miss the postseason.

CREW — Competing at the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Association 
Championships from May 1 to May 2, 
the men’s and women’s crew teams man-
aged to earn a bit of honorable mention 
— including the Efficiency Trophy on 
the men’s side. The award is given to 
the team that has the best results based 
on the number of boats in competition. 
Held in Gold River, Calif., the champi-
onships featured top competition from 
the West Coast. 

On the men’s side, three boats com-
peted in the finals on Sunday, having 
qualified on Saturday. The junior-varsity 
eight won their race, and the novice 
eight finished second. However, the var-
sity eight — unable to overcome a slow 
start — did not fare as well, finishing 
sixth in their race. The novice boat, hot 
on the tail of the Orange Coast College 
squad, was welcomed to the finish line 
with the flash of a camera — and it was 
only after an official review that the 
Tritons were declared the runners-up.

UCSD head coach Zach Johnson was 
named WIRA Coach of the Year for the 
second consecutive year, and junior Jon 
Seibert was selected to the All-WIRA 
second team for his influential perfor-
mance on the junior-varsity eight over 
the weekend. 

Third-place finishes by both the var-
sity and junior-varsity eight-boats led 
the women’s team, while the second nov-
ice eight-boat took sixth place in its race.

Despite an inexperienced roster, the 
Tritons pushed to make themselves via-
ble contenders. 

“We have a young team,” women’s 
coach Pattie Pinkerton said. “It takes 
a couple of years to build the strength 
and endurance needed to compete on a 
national level. But we had some coura-
geous races, and I was really excited to 
see that.” 

Senior Brianna Patterson raced in 
five separate boats over the weekend, 
and her versatility earned her a spot on 
the All-WIRA second team.

While the final WIRA races signaled 
the end of the men’s season, the wom-
en’s team will return to Gold River on 
May 15 to compete in the Pacific Coast 
Rowing Championships for a final week-
end of competition.

BASEBALL — The nationally No. 1 nationally-
ranked UCSD baseball team, having claimed 
California Collegiate Athletic Association regular-
season honors after sweeping a series against the San 
Francisco State Gators from April 30 to May 1, will 
enter the postseason as heavy favorites.

In the series opener on Friday, The Tritons sent 
their reputation even further, scoring in every inning 
except the fourth and collecting a total of 24 hits. 
Junior outfielder Kyle Saul and senior shortstop 
Vance Albitz jump-started the offense at the top of the 
lineup with four hits apiece, while sophomore desig-
nated hitter Danny Susdorf and senior catcher Kellen 
Lee combined for eight hits and runs batted in. Junior 
right-hander Tim Shibuya tossed six innings of one-
run ball, and the Tritons cruised to a 19–3 victory.

Lee said his team faced the Gators as if they were 
already competing in the playoffs. 

“We approached the SFSU series as if it was the 
first weekend of the postseason,” Lee said. “In essence, 
we practiced playing in the postseason — so when it 
starts up this weekend, we will already have felt the 
postseason atmosphere.”

On Saturday, the Tritons and Gators played a 
doubleheader. Behind senior right-handed pitcher 

Matt Rossman, CCAA player of the week, UCSD 
cruised to a 9–1 win. Rossman tossed five innings, 
allowing one run while striking out nine.

Rossman said his focus on pitch location — spe-
cifically for off-speed pitches — has helped improve 
his game.

“My success has come from just pounding down 
in the strike zone to both sides of the plate and locat-
ing off-speed pitches for strikes,” Rossman said. “I try 
to keep it pretty simple.”

On offense, the Tritons churned out a total of 17 
hits, while junior second baseman Grant Bauer hit his 
second home run of the season.

In Game Two, the Gators shook the Tritons up a 
bit by jumping out to a 3–0 lead by the second inning. 
However, a seven-run fourth inning propelled UCSD 
into the lead, and the team went on to bag a 9–5 win. 
Senior starting pitcher Kirby St. John earned the win 
by tossing six innings, during which he allowed only 
five earned runs.

Michael Benton hit his fourth homer of the year, 
while Saul and Albitz combined for six hits at the top 
of the lineup.

On Sunday, the Tritons completed their four-
game sweep against the Gators behind the arm 
of junior starter Guido Knudson. Knudson hurled
