In a discovery that could pave the way for 
the development of an tnexpenSlve and envi-
ronmentally safe means of controlling para-

covered that Bacillus thuringlensls - a bac-

ers for five decades - can also produce slm· 
ilar natural proteins tha III nematodes. 

Each year, parasitic roundworms destroy 
billions of dollars In crops, cause debilitating 
diseases In farm animals and pe s, and now 
Infect a quarter of he wond's human pepu·

Muslim youths urged to speak up 
MSA's American Muslim Week launched 

Michigan lawyers 
file brief in AA case 

By CHRlmNE PAl 
Contributing Writer 

The Muslim Student Associati n 
presented a lecrure by Dr. jeffrey 
Lang on Feh. 18 regarding the disil -
lusionment of American Muslim 
youth and how it should be resolved. 
The event is part of the MSA's 

Americ~n Muslim week. 
Lang, a professor at the 
Ulli ver~ity of Kansas, converted to 
Isb m in 1982 and has si nce been 
advocating issues concerning 
Muslims lil~ng in the United tates, 

p~rticu l arly the Muslim you th com-
munity. ne of his main concerns is 
that second-generation Muslims 
who arc erious about thei r religion 
are scarce, and that most of the 
Muslims who anend mosque arc 
immigrants or foreign students. 

" great majority of Americ~n 
Muslims were born here, and my 
question is: Where are they?" said 
Lang. "This group, this great major-
ity of Muslims in America, are 
nowhere ro be found ." 

ne of the main reasons why the 
American Muslim youth seems to be 
waning is because of its lack of voice, 
Lang sa id. 

"If you have a patient, you're not 
going to figure it out unless they 
complain," Lang said. "Thats the 
problem ... the community isn't 
complaining. " 

Lang also stated that Muslim 
youths born in the United States are 
bound to have different values. 

"They're as American as apple 
pie," Lang said . "A lot of what 
America values were incorporated in 
them, and they develop a Western 
personality." 

What contributes to this imbal-
ance of Western and Muslim values, 
Lang said, is the way the youth is 
taught in Amenca. Lang said that 
Western seholars are teaching Islam 
to the youth in America, and 
although knowledgeable about what 
they teach, they are bound to be 
biased. His solution to this problem 
i attaining "both sides of scholar-
ship" by employing both Muslim 
reachers as well as non-Muslim ones. 

Lang's reasoning as to how di il-
lusionmem forms within the com-
munity is the clash of American and 
Islamic cultures. 

"The mosque culture and the 
American culture clash, and they are 
lOrn as 10 wluch onc they should 
devote themselves 10," Lang said. 
"Young peoplc arc torn and pulled 
by the intellectual divide." 

For example, he said that 
Muslims follow the tradition of con-

University maintains race i 
necessary for student diver ity 

Rachel A Garcia/Guardian 
American way: Muslim-American youths are urged by Dr. Jeffrey Lang to assert their 
cultural identity by practlong their faith regularly and lobbying their Interests. 
formity, that which is eternal and 
certain limitations on complete free 
speech. He explained that American 
values contrast because they involve 
individualism and free speech. 

Ilowever, some members of the 
audience thought differendy. A few 
aid that American upbringing and 

the instilling of American values is 
not the factor in disillusionment 
among the second generation of 
Muslim youths, and that their faith 
in the religion is the main drive to 
maintain devotion to Islamic culture. 

MSA President Ahmad Bailony 
sa id, "Here, it's not a matter of cul -
nITC, it's a matter of faith . With any 
faith that you are, it's always hard. 
For me, it's a maner of my own faith, 
and thats what keeps me going." 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore Don Tran, a 
Viemamesc-American Muslim, 
agreed. 

"The disillusionment doesn't 
come from living in America," he 
said. U!t's more of the way thc first 
generation raises you, and it's in the 
faith within ourselves." 

Several first-generation parents 
of Muslim children attended the lec-
ture as well. 

"Mainly, if there is any disillu-
sionment, it comes from the par-
ents," said one unidentified Muslim 
parent. "The religion starts from 
horne." 

When asked if discrimination 
toward Muslims living in America 
contributed to any di illusionment, 
one student disagreed. 

"It really depends on one's own 
faith and support urrounding 
thcm," aid ERC sophomore Anbar 
Mahar. 

ER junior Sarah Abukar said 

that being black and Muslim, living 
in America has not been a challenge. 

"No matter what race you are, 
you're going to face the same types 
of problcms," she said. " ne of the 
good things is that once a lot of dif-
ferent groups come together in the 
Muslim community, thcre will be a 
lot of support for each other." 

Abukar said that being Muslim is 
not the only factor that causes disil-
lusionment among youths. 

"Growing up as a tcen, you're 
going to feel disillusionment any-
way," Abukar said. "It's still harder to 
find your place in society no matter 
what, especially if you're a tcen." 

Some questioned why disillu-
sionment among the Muslim-
American youth scems to be more 
worrisome than the disillUSIOnment 
among Asian-Americans or Larino-
Americans. Bailony said that it's not 
a worrisome issue, but that it is an 
issue fairly new to America. 

"Right now, Muslims don't have 
that rich history, such as the history 
of Irish immigrants in America. The 
growing pains of adapting into a new 
environment is just setting in," he 
said. 

Besides altering the way students 
are taught Islam in America, Lang 
mentioned other things one can do 
to stop the process of disillusion-
ment among youths. He said that 
focusing on God and the Koran is 
the major issue, as is allowing higher 
tolerance among each other. 

MSA is presenting the 
"Dynamics of Islamic Identity in 
America" at 7 p.m. in Center I [all 
113 on Feb. 20, and is al 0 holding

Policy" on Feb. 21 at 7 p.m. 111

M;ch;gan Daily (U. Michigan) 
(U-WlRE) I ARBOR, 

Mich. - University of Michigan 
lawyers argued that the use of 
race as an adnus ions factor is 
essential for creating a diverse 
student body, but it does nor sub-
stitute for academiC qualifica-
tions, in bnefs filcd with the U.S. 
upreme Court on Feb. I . 

The universiry briefs were 
joined hy about 60 amlCU, or 
"friend of the court," bnefs from 
300 national organizations and 
corporations, expected to be filed 
by the Feb. 19 deadline, which 
was delayed from a day earlier 
due to weather concerns. 

University lawyers laid out 
their legal arguments in the uni-
versity briefs for the two law-
suits , Gmtttr v. Bollillger and 
Gratz v. Bollmger, which chal -
lenge the use of race a a factor 
in the admissions policies of the 
law school, as well as the college 
of literature, science and the arts. 

The court will hear oral argu-
ments on the cases April I . 

Both briefs state that using 
race as a pi us factor is vi tal to the 
university's goal of achieving a 
diverse student body, and both 
also present empirical evidence 
arguing that diversity benefits all 
university students. 

"The university cannot 
achieve meaningful diver iry 
without considering race or eth-
nicity as factors in admissions," 
the Gratz brief stated . 

But the briefs argue that the 
universiry's admissions policies 
consider many factors beside race, 
and conform to the courts ruling 
in Univtrriry of Calif erma Board of 
Rtgmu v. BaUt, university gener-
al counsel Marvin Kri lov said. 

In the Bakke case, the court 
banned racial quotas but allowed 
the use of race in conjunction 
with other admissions factors. 

"We take the BaUe principles 
into account and give some 
weight to race, but the predomi-
nant weight is academic," Krislov 
said. "We do a decent job of bal-
ancing these factOrs ." 

The LSA policy grants 20 
points out of a possible 150 for 
race, while the law school's policy 
gives increased weight to candi-

ground in an attempt to crcate J

".\linonty enrollment 
depends on a varlery of thing, ," 
Knslov said. "\Ne've heen very 
clear that we don't have a qUOIa ." 

But Curt Levcy, spokesman 
for the Center for [ndll'ldual 
Rights, a Washington-based 13\1 
firm representmg the plamllffs m 
both ca es, saltl CrR's Stati'ollc.ll 
analysis proves the law school 
accepts mmoriry students With 
grade point average, 1.2 POIl1IS 
less than while students. 

Krislov said whde several 
black students With lower grades 
and [est scores [han pbllHlff 
Barbara Grutter were accepred, 
many white students displaY1ng 
special talents or diverse charac-
terisllcs have also been accepted 
ahead of morc academically qual -
ified students. 

Levey said less qualified whire 
students are accepted occaSIOnal-
ly, but the law school automati-
cally accepts minority students. 
The racial composition of classes 
admined to the law school has 
held constant at around J3 per-
cent in recent years, he said. 

"Race is the one factor that 
allows you to systematicall y get 
in," Levey said. "If it ounds like 
a quota , it is a quota." 

Many qualificd minorities are 
rejected every year, Krlslov aid, 
but the racial composition of 
each class is si milar because the 
pool of applicants rarely changes 
dramatically. 

Stanford law professor Paul 
Brest said the key issue in the Jaw 
school case is "whether they are 
aiming for 13 percent and just 
disguising it." 

He said the evidence each ide 
presents will have an impact on 
the decision of justice Sandra 
Day O'Conner, whom many 
legal experts consider to be the 
swing vote in the case . 

Although the LSA policy con-
siders numerous factor , race is 
the only one for which the UI1l-
versity is targeting a et number 
of applicants, Levey said.

Warren College 
Student Council's 
debt reprehensible 

After spending $405.31 for stress balls, 
S565.56 for frisbees and S604.54 for zipper 
wallets during fall quarter, the Warren 
College tudent Council enacted a spend-
ing freeze on Feb. J3 due to money mis-
management. As a result, other Warren stu-
dent organizations will not receive key 
funding while the WC C anempts to fig-
ure out how much money is in its budget. 

It is completely reprehensible that the 
WCSC was so irre ponsible with its funds. 
The trouble has been blamed on a misun-
derstanding of the amount of money avail-
able to the council at the beginning of the 
year. But if it was unclear how mud, money 
wa in the council's budget in the beginning 
of the year, council members should have 
been more careful about what was spent. 

Also, this confu ion would not have 
arisen had the council kept better track of 
its pending. It is always important for an 
organization, especially one that is designed 
to benefit tudents, to carefully document 
how much money is being spent and what it 
is actually being used for. Balancing a 
checkbook is a skill that most have mas-
tered by the time they reach college. More 
respomibility t~ expected of the we , 
and It I cerrainl\, owed to the )tudent~ of 
Earl Warren Col1ege. 

Furthermore, over $3,000 of the mone\' 
~pent thtS )'ear did not benefit student life. 
The WCSC should only be spending money 
on projec and organtzatiom that WIll bene-
fit student It e at \\'arren college. Frisbees, 
retreats and stress balls can, in moderation, 
foster a sense of community and enable ben-
eficial council commUnication - but the 
cxces es the cOllncil displayed are frivololls 
expen e that should never have been made, 
especially if the council was unsure of how 
much money it had at irs disposal. 

Although it should never have come to 
t.his state of affairs, the we ·C was right to 
freeze its spending until it is more familiar 
with the limits orits budget. However, the 
council should not ask for a fee referendum 
until it gets its financial affairs in order and 
can prove that it will be more re ponsible 
with its money. The WCSC needs to get a 
firmer hold on the money It already has 
before it can even think of asking for more.

LEIIER TO THE EDITOR 
Criticism of Guardian 

was poorly timed 
Edi tor: 

In voicing her opinions about the 
newspa per. Sheila Sayani (" Letter to 
the Editor," Feb. 13) exploits a 
recent article about a student's tragic 
death. Aside from suggesting that 
the staff and coverage are incompe-
tent, Sayani petulantly implies, in 
self-aggrandizing strokes, that the 
readership demand more. Sayanis 
tirade should have waited for a more 
fitting target. 

ay:mi asserts that the "poorly 
wrincn" original article left readers 
with "no closure." Most readers 
accept that sometimes article lack 
clo ure because the events covered 

" 

11011' insensitive of Sayani to imply 
that the editors were so deliberately 
and ignobly motivated. Ilow insen-
sitive to suggest that readers believe 
only long artJCles cover important 
issues. And how horribly insensitive 
to minimize atalie Summerfishl; 
death by assaulting the article cover-
ing it, turning a sad and solemn 
event into a personal mouthpiece. 

Most of us are patient and wait 
until details of such events corne 
out naturally, from the proper 
authorities. Sayani clearly wants to 
be an investigative reporter - her 
tabloid sleuth act invokes a "homi-
cidal maniac roaming around, wait-
ing to push pcople off buildings." . 
In her third and fifth paragraphs, 
she searche vainly for answers. She 

are, in fact, unre-
solved . Sadly, writ-
ers often feel the 
need to indulge a 
drama-thirstyaudi-
ellce. I bel ievc the

author was appro-
priate in erving 
readers' needs,

attacking is the worst way to endear 
a listener and the way to force your 
opinion, howe"er valid, into Impo-

Although most readers know 
article size is not necessarily propor-
tional to relevance, Sayani slams the 
suff and readers: "Clearly, the staff

article to weigh 111 on? Why drop 
so many hint about how she could 
have done It better' Concluding 
with self-righteous disgust, she 
write, "Unquestionably, the paper 
lacks substance and a sense of

Unquestionably, her letter lacks

all over-abundance of sclf-impor-

Ultimate goal of homework is lost 
Grading procedure encourages cheating 

horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

C onsider three scenarios: First, a lower-division calculus class with rou-
tine weekly homework assign-
ments. The problems are gener-
ally easy enough that the majori-
ty of papers turned in tend to 
have right answers; as a result, 
catching tudents who copy 
someonc else's work is near 
impossible because most of the 
answers are nearly correct, and 
those that are not arc likely com-
mon errors among all the stu-
dents. 

Scenario two: A class with few 
students ha~ weekly assignments 
that constitute a large portion of 
the students' final grade. The 
only restrictton IS that assign-
ments turned In must not be 
IdenlicaJ. The assignments are 
meant to be extremely challeng-
Ing, and without collaboration 
between students - Including 
advice from students who have 
finished the assignment, as well 
as those who have not - almost 
nobody m the cla s .would learn 
anything. 

Scenario three: An upper-divi-
sion engineermg class has routine 
homework that forms a very 
sl\1all portion of the grade. 

todents are allowed to collabo-
rate, but only with other students 
who have not finished the assign-
ment. The assignments are mod-
erately difficult; as uch, catching 
those who copy verbatim is POSSI-
ble. 

In these three scenarios, 
would it be fair, or even possible, 
to apply the same standards of 
cheattng) For example, while 
two students llIay turn in nearly 
identical copie in the lower-

division class with no problem 
(and indeed may not have even 
talked to each other), such 
behavior in the last two cases-
would be pounced upon. Some 
students, when accused of cheat-
ing. grumble that some combina-
tion of both unenforceable stan-
dards and changing policies from 
professor to professor has so 
impaired their ability to judge 
when collaboration is allowed 
that it is in fact unfair for profes-

" Some students, when

sors to level accusations against 
tbem, in spite of the fact that the 
poliCies are often pelled out 
quite clearly at the beginning of 
each course. 

The e are not restricted caseSj 
this writer, in less than tbree 
years, has managed to go 
through no less than three class-
es In which the professors were 
so upset with rampant, Wide-
spread cheating on homework 
assignments that they took class 
time to readdress their policies 
and condemn the behaVIOr of 
those accused. 

There is obviously some di -
crepancy in the way many stu-

dents view decent behavior and 
the way their professor~ often 
expect them to act. 

Why is this? Perhaps we 
should go back to wha t the goal of 
homework assignments is in any 
field of study at the univmity. 
Ilomework assignments diStill-
gt,ish themselves from examllled 
material insofar as their use IS to 
provide incentives for snldents to 
educate themselves In out-ot-
classroom activity, as opposed to 
testing their knowledge of the 
material. 

While this may be tantamount 
to babying students along. no 
doubt students learn more If 
incentives are prOVided for them 
to do out-of-c1ass assignments. 
Thus, the core objective in assign-
ing homework IS to encourage 
learning among tudenrs. 
ObVlously, copyi ng another stu-
dent's homework and passmg It off 
as one's own docs little toward 
achieving thiS aim, even Without 
any conSideration of the mor;11 
consequences. 

i\Jthough It I entirely plausl-
blc that some people learn best 
from verbatim copying, they call 
do thiS With a timely solution set, 
If such an item were made readily 
available . Thus, It seems that 
restrictions on student behaVIOr 
- such as spending some down-
time between diSCUSSing an 
answer with another person and 
writing down a solution - seem 
rather ludicrous if they are 
Inhibitor to student learning. 
One ha to strike at the core rea-
son why students cheat on home-
work; because there are incentives 
to do so.

Matthews: Singer abuses fame, power 
cominued from page 4 

which he provided evidence of an 
Iraq-al Qaeda link, Matthews 
seems to have paid no attention, 
nor cared. 

"Is [Husseinl our target 
because he is easier to identify 
than the illusive [sic] terrorist 
network?" Matthews asks. He 
mu t have missed Bush's recent 

tate of the Union, in which we 
were informed that we have dis-
posed of dozens of high-ranking 
al Qaeda operatives all over the 
globe who had felt "American 
justice. ~ 

Challenging those who feel 
that the liberation of Iraq is the 
true goal of a war, Matthews goes 
on to write that, "It is certainly 
not to liberate the people ofIraq, 
who suffer under Hussein 's rule, 
unless we call killing hundreds of 
thou ands of Iraqis liberation." 
But of course the American mili-
tary is not planning the death of 
"hundreds of thou and" of Iraqi 
civilians. 

Cona-ary to Matthews' belief. 
numerous stories have sa-essed 
the strenuous bombing campaign 
that would be aimed at military 
targets. not civilian ones. and for 
good reason since collateral dam-
age would serve ab olutely no 
purpo e in affecting the hearties

Hussein . 
"The U.N. weapons inspectors 

must be allowed to do their job 
thoroughly, and any military 
action should be internationally 
agreed upon," the songwriter con-
cludes. 

" Next time Matthews , or 
any other celebrity for 
that matter, wants to 

speak out against war in 
Iraq , they must do their 
hometoork. This is the 

public arena, and coming 
across like a joker is no 

joke." 

Yet it's become glaringly obvi-
ou that the weapon inspectors 
haven't been able to do their job. 
This became e pecially clear after 
Powell revealed a not-so-startling 
phone conversation between two 
Iraqi offiCial conspiring to muck 

up inspections in his U.N . presen-
tation. 

Toward the end of his 
undoubtedly heartfelt letter, 
Matthews says. "1 fear that our 
true motivation is about oil and 
our own flailing economy." I 
assume he is not referring to the 
same economy that is growing at 
over 3 percent, where unemploy-
ment is dropping and interest 
rates are at 4O-year lows - all 
after the collapse of the technolo-
gy sector and 9/11. 

And as for oil, any suggestion 
that we want to take over Iraq 's 
oil is absurd . Any doubters 
should look back and realize that 
the U .S . government didn't 
monopolize the oil resources 
back when Bush's father, former 
President George H .W. Bush, 
had easy access to Middle 
Eastern oil fields in the early '90s 
after the Gulf War. Keep in mind 
those are the same fields that 
Hussein torched and U.S. troops 
stayed after, cleaning up the 
mess. 

So next time Matthews. or any 
other celebrity for that matter, 
wants to speak out against a war in 
u-aq. they must do their home-
work. This i the public arena. and 
coming across like a joker is no 
joke.

est, strong effort

Now, while that 
may be a valuable 
lesson insofar as 
industry goes, 
those lessons can 
be taught rather 
effectively with 
examinations . 
Homework, on the 
other hand. is 
meant to provide

perhaps the stu-
dents should be

that is exactly what 
midterms and finals

learning and practicing the materi -
al. 

The problem is that by turning 
in homework that is graded on its 
correctness rather than its good-
faith effort, students have an 
incentive. especially in easier 
classes where copying is more dif-
ficult to spot, to pursue the cor-

quences of academic dishonesty 
seems a more sane route . 
Homework would still be graded 
with an eye toward good effort 
rather than correct answers, and 
returned under such a system. of 
course. since the most he lpful part 
of written homework for many 
students is to see exactly what 
mistakes they made in the first 
place. 

Thi is by no mcans to say that 
enforcing correct work is not a 
valuable thing. But that IS exactly 
what midterm, and findls are for. 
and if [hc TAs could be bothered 
to do It and the departments could 
afford it. perhap., the hetter route 
would be three 10\\ -s tress 
midrcnm (or more appropriately, 
quiz7Cs) in a quarter rather than 
one high-stress one. If depart-
ments were willing to invest the 
resources. thc best way around the 
problem would be a two-step 
process: a first turn -tn. where 
homework assignment are ana -
lyzed and given a provi ional 
grade based on the original cor-
rectness. with hints on how to fin-
ish the problems correctly; and a 
second pass, where revised and 
presumably more correct answers 
are given . 

But given the resources for 
undergraduate teaching here, that 
would be a luxury beyond dreams. 
At the very least. department-wide 
policies, spanning from lower to 
upper division cia ses, with specifi-
cations for each type of out-of-
class assignments - routine home-
work, projects, significant weekly 
assignments, etc. - would be 
appreciated. with consideration 
toward the maximum amount of 
collaboration allowed. Because at a 
university, if we are not to learn 
from other human beings. then 
what are we to learn from? The 
textbooks? 

I n the last installment of this column, the URL for a site developed by UCSD students 
for rating professors was given 
incorrectly. The correct address is 
btrp:llwww. ,wdpro!mor. com. The 
columnist realizes he is indeed a 
complete and total moron and 
could be bothered to check the

tn any case, as StudentLink is 
likely to make no move to implc-
ment an online professor rating 
SYSlem (as it is doubrful whether 
anyone actually bolhers 10 read the 
column anyway), one hopes stu-
dents might latch on to the afore-

Indeed create an online cOlnmuOlry

Dogs: Doctors collect over 150 signatures from SD medical community 
conLlnlted from page I 

"Killing dogs is outside the 
mainstream by now." Ilansen said. 
"I think that MDs know that it's 
unneccssary, but Ph.D.s tend to be 
obsessive about their research -
but we physicians practice and see 
that it's not tlseful." 

Dog labs, according to Hansen 
and other speakers. are not uscd for 
research. and are repeated each 
year in the same manner. 

l11C dogs, which are purpose-
bred for experimcntation. are anes-
thetized and injected with various 
dmgs that raise and lower their heart 
and breathing rates. Five srudents 
and dog observe the processes. all 
the while monitoring the data inpuL 

"This gives students an experi-
ence which really cements knowl-
edge into placc." said professor of 
pharmacology and medicme 
Lawrence Brunton, who runs the 
labs . "The information that is 
extracted from the labs is in the 
coursc textbook. but what you can't 

get from a textbook or a computer 
simulation is the physical experi-
ence of doing this ." 

According to Brumon. it is most 
students' first time having to 
respond to the data of a living sub-
ject. 

" In the textbook, srudents will 
learn one response to a drug," 
Brunton aid. " But in real life. there 
is biological variability, and students 
in the labs see that responses don't 
always look like textbook responses." 

For this quarter's first lab. 50 
students out of 120 opted to ski p 
the labs. 

"Test scores don't show any dif-
ference at all between the people 
who have opted out and stayed in," 
said Anthony Adame, a sophomore 
who opted out. "And that's what 
you're most worried about as a stu-
dent." 

Freshmen are presented with 
information about the labs during 
orientation. According to Hansen. 
opponents of the labs were denicd 

their request to be provided with an 
equal amount of time to present 
their views during orientation week. 

"I think there is some pressure 
to do the labs, especially UCSD 
being such a prestigious school." 
said Solomon Maya, a junior who 
opted out of the labs. "But the most 
pressure is from other srudents, not 
really the university. It's their own 
choice ." 

Brunton, who said that the lab 
was started an hour early so that 
students participating would not 
feel pressure from the protesters, 
felt that there was pressure on stu-
dents from both sides. 

"This year. the peer pressure 
seems to run to the side of opting 
out," Brunton said . "Some students 
also got anti-vivisection literature 
in their mailboxes. and that dis-
turbed them." 

According to Hansen. freshmen 
do not yet have the perspective 
necessary to decide whether or not 
to attend the labs. 

"I killed twO dogs In medical 
school. and ( practice medicine. but 
never once have I had to make a 
tough diagnosis and looked back 
and said, 'If only I killed more 
dogs ... • Hansen said. 

UCSD pathologist Carla 
Stayboldt recalled her experience 
with dog labs 20 years ago. 

"That experience was very dif-
ferent from my surgical experience. 
where we used dogs to learn 
surgery under sterile technique, 
and the dogs lived." Stayboldt said. 
"I didn't realize what we were 
doing was wrong 20 years ago, but 
1 know it's wrong now." 

The dogs cost $576 each . 
UCSD sta rted using dogs in 1968. 
but used pound dogs slated for 
killing until, according to Brunton , 
pressure from protesters made the 
school turn to buying dogs from 
private breeders. 

"The school says it's humane 
because the dogs are anesthetized," 
I lansen said. "But that discounts all 

the years they've spent in a cage." 
Bmoton has worked with the labs 

for 20 years and has seen the number 
of dogs used diminish to about one-
tlurd of thc original number. I Ie 
called the labs "modern." 

"It's not the lab that other 
schools have gwen up." Brunton 
said. "The reason that other schools 
don't do this lab is that. to some 
extent, they've been IOt,midatcd by 
animal rights movements. lack 
resources and also. to some extent, 
have already lost thiS knowledge." 

Protesters of the San Diego 
community were also present at the 
protest, including several annnal 
rights activists who started chanti -
ng. and were asked to be quiet. 

"This is a calm, mainstream, 
respectable effort," Harrison said. 
"r t's a very simple Issue that every 
San Diego citizen has the ability to 
understand . You don't need to be 
an MD to figure this out." 

The next lab IS scheduled for 
Feh. 26.

"It 's very sImple." Hill ald. "It·s

Iltil. who worked on mslltutmg 
Instant runoff \'ot1l1g m . an 
FrancIsco. argued 111 favor of 
implcmeming 1I1stam runoff voong 
at the statc and local level . 

Instant nmoff voting seeks to 
cIect candidates by creating a sim-
ple ma)Orley. by allowing the voters 
to rank the candidates in order of 
preference. If no candidate rccelves 
3 prima facie majOrity. an Instant 
runoff occurs. 111 which the prefer-
ence vote are tallied to dctermmc 
\\ hich candidatc is preferred by the 
ma)onl)' of voters. 

"If you take the same ,·otes [m a 
pi ura II l)' system] and put them 
through di fferent voting ystcms. 
[you WIll] come up with complctely 
different results." he ald."j mean. 
think about it. It sounds k.md of 
arbitrary. " 

Hill cited Franklin Elementary 
chool in Berkeler. Calif .• whIch 

use instant runoff voting to elect 
its student body president. as proof 
of the instant runoff voting system's 
simplicity. 

IIill went on to describe what 
he called low repre entation rate 
of women and mlllonoes in the 
government. both of whJch he said 
were respectively at about 14 per-
cent 111 the House of 
Represcntuoves. I Iill saId that WIth 
a proporoonal representaoon sys-
tem, these groups would be more 
reflecnve of the larger populaoon. 

"Some people try and balk al the 
Idea of usmg race in this way. or 
uslllg gender In tlus way. but the fact 
of the maner is that it's already belllg 
used now," Hill saId. "Race still mat-

ter~ in thc United States 111 2003 ." 
The usc of a proportional repre-

sentation system would also theo-
retJcalll' allow for increased repre-
entation of third parttes. such as 

the Green Party and Libertarian 
Party. In government. Currently. 
the proportional represcntation 
systcm IS used in most European 
democracle • a well as in Israel and 
Japan. 

In a proportional repre enta-
tion. legIslative seats are deter-
mined by the respective percentage 
earned by each political party. At its 
mo.t basic and unaltered form, a 
poIiocal part)' fieldmg candidates 
for a legislature that cam 60 per-
cent of the vote in a proportional 
representation sy tem is entitled to 
60 percent of the available cats. 

Hill linked democracies that 
have hIgher voter turnout than the 
United tate to their usc of pro-
pomonaI representation sy tcms 
and instant runoff voting. 

"All these things are being dra-
maocally affected by this winner-
take-all system. which is basically 
I th century democracy technolo-
gy." he said. "I think it's important 
to under tand that our svstem i 
breaking down." . 

Iltll' appearance coincided with 
the A .. Ad Hoc Task Force on 
Voting Systems' testS of three pro-
posed new voting systems on cam-
pus. A target of about 150 5nldentS 
will have an opportunity to sample 
the proposed voting systcms vIa 
100 k set up on Library Walk from 
I p .m . to 4 p.m . on Feb. 21. 
Following the sample e1ectlon. thc 
task force WIll meet to re\1C\\ the 
results and make ItS final determl-
nanon. 

Some members of the task 
force. including Eleanor Roosevelt 
College Freshman Senator and 
Task Force hair Max I Yarrington. 
were present in the audicnce. 

The task force is cxamining 
three prospective voting systems: 
lOstant runoff voting; Condorcet 
voting, a pairwise method in which 
the voters' preferences of candi -
dates are evaluated as one-an-one 
races between pairs. with the win-
ner determined by r311king; and 
approval voting, 111 which voters 
make a "yes" or "no" vote for all 
the candidates running for a single 
office. with the mo~t "yes" votes 
winning. 

Harrington said that despite 
looking at new systems. the task 
force might just as well decide to 
recommend keeping the current 
system. 

"The rea on why wc're even 
looking at it in the first place is 
because we do feel that the system 
can be improved. because we don't 
think it's good for democracy that 
omebody can be elected with such 

a low percentage of the vote." he 
said. "We don't feel that [the cur-
rent voting system) actually shows 
the true preference of the voters ." 

Harrington said that any 
changes would not take effect until 
after the spring 2003 .5. elections. 

"If everything goes well. this 
election \\ ill be the last elecoon 
u ing the current system." he said .

'Angels' masterful in its 
artistic diversity 

Theatre and dance department production 
explores the various arrays of gay issues 

By JESSICA LONG 
Senior Staff Writer 

The latest UCSD Theatre and Dance Department produc-tion, "Angels In America : A 
Gay Fantasia n National 
Themes, Part ne: Millennium 
Approaches," i a three-hour 
rollercoaster ride of emotion rang-
109 from joy to sorrow, from hope 
to despair. 

This is a powerful play that 
focuse on the lives of gay men 10 
the rrud- 1980s, and has won both a 
Ton), Award and a Pulitzer Prize. 
Both the characters and the IS ue 
touched on are diver e. "Angels [n 
Amenca" looks at the lives of a 
variety of men ranging from highly 
succe sful lawyer Roy Cohn, to 
flamboyant drag queen Prior 
Walter, to Mormon businessman 
Jo eph Porter Pitt. This play al 0 
focuses on a number of issues fac-
ing the gay community, from reli-
gion, to politics, to public accep-
tance, to defirung themselves. 

However, the most dramatic 
Issue of the play is AIDS and the 

ra\~shing effect it has on both those 
who have the disease and those 
around them. This production 
doesn't hold much back and does a 
wonderful Job of showing the dev-
a tating physical, mental and emo-
tional effects that are involved with 
AIDS. 

The actors do a wonderful job 

Theater 
REVIEW 

with such serious subject matter 
and handle the intensity of the pro-
duction well. They also do a great 
job of providing as much comic 
relief as possible so that the viewer 
doesn't get overwhelmed with all of 
the seriousness of the play. 

The set is versatile and well -
sui ted to the play, which has many 
different scene and spaces that 
need to be represented. The use of 
multimedia, such as television sets 
and a variety of music, add to the 
feel of the play. 

The only downside to the play is 
that it ends without really drawing 
the story to a close. There is a sen e 
of frustration left over after watch-
ing these characters bare their ouls 
for three hours and then not know-
Ing what happens to them. 

This is a masterful production 
with lotS of depth and feeling, and 
should not be missed. This show is 
for mature audiences only because 
it contains serious subject matter 
and nudity.

Superb 'Detective Story' explores justice 
Lamb's Players Theatre adapts granddaddy of the cop drama 

By JONATHAN JOSEPHSON 
Staff Writer 

The Lamb' Players thea ter in Coronado presents a power-fully dramatic and entertain-
ing production in "Detective 
Story," playing now through 
1arch 16. Superbly acted and cre-

atively designed, this production 
of ce lebrated ew York play-
wright idney Kingsley'S greatest 
work combines the hard-edge pes-
simism of cops dealing with the 
daily dredge of American society 
with the hope of a new future 
worth fighting for. 

Directed by Robert myth, the 
ensemble play of 28 cast members 
looks at the life and conflicts of 
four sets of criminal , each guilty 
of crimes of various severity, and a 
host of NYPD detectives going 
about their daily routine. 
Kingsley'S work, credited as being 
the granddaddy of all forms of 
visual police drama, from 
"Dragnet" to "NYPD Blue," is a 
bittersweet look into the minds 
and motivations of cops, criminals 
and the true meaning of American 
justice. 

The play begins at 5:30 p.m. , 
only a few hours before quirring 
time for the detectives. 
Protagonist detective David 
McLeod (David Cochran Heath), 
the worn-out, tired cop says, 
"Thieves and murderers could 

Theater 
REVIEW 

have written the penal codes 
themselves," while he is begrudg-
ingly forced to set a murderer free 
on a technicality. McLeod is con-
vinced that there should be one set 
of laws for mankind : Those that 
do wrong should be punished, and 
punished severely. As the play 
moves forward, a barrage of 
crooks as different in personality 
as the crimes they commit begins 
to infest the precinct and disman-
tle McLeod's ethics and patience. 

The arrest of Arthur Kindred 
(Nick Cordilcone) sparks 
McLeod's interest. Kindred 
seems to be a generally upstand-
ing young man , but bccause of 
pressures beyond his control, he 
has stolen money from his cver-
faithful employer (George Flint). 
Kindred's situation is not as cut-
and-dry as those of the other 
criminals presented in the play, 
since in addition to being a crim-
inal, he is also a avy hero and 
an overall decent citizen. The 
first moral line has been drawn : 
Must the law always stay firm on 
black-and-white dogma, or can 
an honest cop turn the other way 
to save a potentially good man? 
The answer may surprise you. 

A bit later, the rea l scum of 
the ew York underworld begins 
to surface. Two burglars, ca ught 
in the act of stea ling severa l 
thousands of dollars from an 
upper-class home, are pulled into 
the station hou se. Lewis Uon 
Lorenz) and Charlie (equity 
actor J . Michael Ross) deny the 
theft and are obviously lyi ng, 
pushing the entire precinct to its 
moral heels. With this duo, we 
see how the law can be twisted . 

By exploring both the mindset 
and physical actions of those 
caught in world of the ew York 
police precinct, Kingsley inve ti-
gates the nature of American jus-
tice and presents a view for all 
complications associ ated with 
such . How far can a cop or any 
good man go to see his vision of 
justice enacted? I [ow far should 
he be able to ) When does good-
ness control the law and when 
does the law do nothing but give 
criminals a chance to evade rep-
rimand? All is revealed in Ihe 
story of one detective.

Interpol to wax melancholic at Canes 
New York band offers gloomy take on 70s post-punk 
By BILLY GIL 

Staff Writer 

Sick of thc New York band thtng~ Do you find yourself a ylllg , "Oh no, not another 
bat h of pretty boys III dirty jeans 
With three-chord ong about beer 
and girls' " Well, these pretty boys

the songs are about girls. If you 
don't Itke it, fear nOt, therc's a

soon enough. 

For those who dig thc band's 
new ong, "PDA," currently ge t -
ting a decent amount of ai rplay 
on rock radio and "MTV2," be 
sure to pick up the band's criucal-
Iy acclaimed debut, "Turn on the 
Bright Lights." Like fellow ew 
Yorkers The troke and The 
\Valkmen, Imcrpol has created a 
debut of dll.zying depth that 
manages to transcend their obvi-
ou~ Influences (mostly late-'70s 
and early-'SOs bands Itke Joy 
DIVISion, The Snlllhs and 
TeleVISion). 

As of late, vocalist Paul Banks, 
gultanst Daniel Kessler, bassist 
Callos D engler and drummer 
Sam Foganno have been the sub-
Ject of much debate over their 
"borrowed" sound . 0 Interpol 
article has ever been able to 
avoid mentionlllg Joy Division at 
least once, and while I 'm surc it 
grows tiresome to the boys' 
melancholy souls, it's not diffi -
cult to see why. Banks' bassy bel -
low and Kessler 's angular gUllar 
anacks conjure up countless 
Images of Ian Urti S and compa -

With other bands mining im-

apart from the pack IS sheer craft.

'David Gale' adds to typical story 
Spacey gives solid performance in latest role 

By DAVID BYNUM 
Senior Staff Writer 

"T he Life of David Gale" can best be 
described as a three-star film with a 
four-star ending. While the trailers 
give us the strange feeling they 

have already seen this film, those who 
attend will be glad ro know that "The Life 
of David Gale" throws more than a few 
twists into the cookie cutter, "Scooby-Doo" 
thriller plot that Hollywood has worn down 
to a frail and rusty nub. 

The freshman screenplay was wrinen 
by Charles Randolph and is set in his 
native Texas, the center of 

" 

Film 
REVIEW 

Spacey pointed out 111 a question-and-
answer session after the film, Universal 
(who released the film) makes its money 
on films like "XXX" and "The lIulk." 
The film is hurt by trying to be something 
that it is not - namely, an innovative, 
independent film . Rather than running 
with a strong plot and good star power, 
direc tor Alan Parker got tripped up trying 

to do too much. Whil e 

Kevin Spacey plays 
a difficult role with 
precision, giving a 
performance more 

some of the film 's strong 
visual content IS necessary, 
some of it is gratuitously 
horrifying and redundant, 
showing the audience what 
they just fini shed thinlting. 

When Spacey was asked 
what he tries to accomplish 
in doing a film, he 
explained that he felt that 
films would usua lly fall 
into one of three cate-"K,Pax" than 

the nation's ever-boiling 
capital punishment 
debate. While the film is 
centered on the death 
penalty, it is not a film that 
falls on one side of the 
issue any more than it 
tries to maintain its neu -
trality. The film uses the 
issue as a vehicle and is 
first and foremost a 
thriller, while its political 
me sage is secondary. 

While the story main-
tains the audience's interest 
throughout, distractions 

"American Beauty." gorie : one where no one 
remembers the character 's 
name, one where the film 

came via Kate Winslet, who is trying to ac t 
again. She lacks a certain maturity that is 
essential to her character, and has several 
weak points throughout the film, which is 
otherwise unmarred in the acting category. 
Kevin Spacey (David Gale) plays a difficult 
role with precision, giving a performance 
more "K-Pax" than "American Beauty." 
While some of his scene come off as hack-
neyed (sec the trailers), they are rare and 
come by virtue of the first- try screenplay, 
brilliant in the grand sense but lacking pol-
ish. 

The film al so tries to include several 
indepcndent elements In what is other-
wise a very TIo llywood production . This 
IS eVident in the brief flashes of words likc 
"guilty" and "j u tice" scrihb lcd on

Interpol will be appearing on the

addition to playing at anes. Opening for 
Interpol at anes are The Warlocks, an up-

and-coming eight-piece band hailing from 
Los Angeles. The Warlocks come from 
more of a '60s approach, channeling the 
accessibility of the Rolling Stones while 
adding the onic squalor of the Velvet

'Gods and Generals' is no call to arms 
Duvall falls short as Lee but 'Stonewall' Jackson can't be missed 

By MARA EVANS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The world around us fluctuates with a srruggle between war and peace. Ronald Maxwell's 
latest American Civil War epic, 
"Gods and Generals," brings to lhe 
big screen a similar struggle that 
took place centuries ago on 
American soil: a divided nation's 
struggle for freedom. 

"Gods and Generals" is a prequel 
to Maxwell's 1993 Civil War epic, 
"Gettysburg." While the fim film 
focused on the culmination of the 
Civil War, "Gods" focuses instead on 
the banle of Fredericksburg, where 
the Union suffered its greatest defeat 
at the hands of the Confederacy. TIle 
principle character in the film is 
Confederate General "Stonewall" 
Jackson, played by Stephen Lang 
("Tombstone''), whose power as a 
leader rivals that of General Robert 
E. Lee (Robert Duvall). 

"Gods and Generals" does not 
rely on any new plot formula; 
rather, it uses the epic subject that 
is the Civil War. Central to lhe 
focus of the film are the emotions 
of all those involved in the war, 
from the generals to their wives to 
the slaves on the verge of emanci-
pation. Ma:tWell draws upon lhe 
deep desires for freedom on both 
sides of the battle lines. It becomes 
clear that the Confederate generals 
love their God, their state and their 
wives - in that order. Many of 
them, including Lang's Jackson, do 
nOt fight to mainlJin slavery, but 
rather to maintain the indepen-
dence of the state of Virginia . 
Conversely, and yet very similarly, 

Film 
REVIEW 

" 'Gcxls and Generals' does 
not rely on any new plot 

fcmnu1a; rather it uses the 
epic subject that is the 

Civil War_ 

the Union soldiers fight not only 
for emancipation, but also the free-
dom of the country as a whole. 

One of the most touching 
scenes of the film takes place dur-
ing the hea t of tile Fredericksburg 
battle, where two Irish battalions 
fight each other. Compounded by 
the severity of watching the Union 
men march into an open field to 
face bullets and cannons are the 
tears of their fellow Confederate 
Irish, who weep as they shoot down 
their immigrant brothers . 

An equa ll y poignant scene occu rs 
when the barrel of a Confederate 
cannon blows up, ending several of 
the onfederate generals, including 
Lee, to the ground amid gun pow-
der and shards of metal. Perhaps this 
is laxwell' way of aying that hind-
Ight is 201l0, and leaves the ques-

tion open to the audience as to what 
the rest of AmericJn history woulll 
have been like had Lee and his fel-
low generals died in such a fluke 

accident. 
Whj le Duvall docs portray a 

composed Lee, he comes across as a 
geriatric gray fox and is unable to 
exercise his acting capacities. Lang, 
however, does a marvelous job as 
Jackson, drawing upon decp reli -
gious convictions and giving the 
most realistic performance of the 
entire film. His portrayal of 
Jackson alone is reason for watch -
ing the four-hour film. 

Yes, it's true, the epic nature of 
"Gods" goes beyond the war and 
permeates every facet of the film. 
This is one of its downfalls; that, and 
the poor quality of digital effects 
that are used to recreate the town-
ships of Fredericksburg. It also 
becomes clear as the film progresses 
that it is impossible to get thousands 
of extras to recreate banle scenes 
with realistic zeal, especially when 
f}and -to-hand combat is called for. 

Granted, a mega-movie about 
the Civil War wi ll not be most col-
lege students' call to arms. However, 
for the sake of better understanding 
the convictions of the United States, 
it is worth watching the Union blue 
and Confederate gray blend togeth-
er into one mass of color on the 
American battlefields. Ilell, even 
watching half the movie will be 
enough.

n-tE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY. FEBRUARY ZOo ZOO) 

'Old School' is typical, but enjoyable 
Hilarious cast revels and celebrates in trip down memory lane 

By SAlAH WOMER 
Contributing Writer 

From "Animal House" to "American Pie 2," comedies love to remind us how much 
fun college is, especially when you 
get all that pesky studying out of 
the way. 

Hollywood continues the rrend 
with its newest cinematic portrayal 
of the ideals of college life: "Old 
School." Starring Wi ll Ferrell , 
Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn, 
the previews look funny and sound 
funny, but it's better than funny -
it's a riot and a half. 

With a typical plot, "Old 
School" is nothing special if your 
interest is in something more than 
a guy-meets-girl, party-like-
there's-no-tomorrow flick. The sit-
uations are funny, yet predictable 
nonetheless. Despite the cast, the 
movie i nothing like "Night at the 
Roxbury" or any other "Saturday

a~er ego 'Frank the Tank' in 'Old School,' the off-campus comedy. 

ight Live" movie. Ferrell, 
Vaughn and Wilson are hilarious 
together; each of their acting styles 
and characters compliments the 
other perfectly. Aside from the 
more-or-Iess classic story line of 
"Old School," attention i sure to 
hold and laughter definitely doesn 't 
cease. 

The audience can't help but 
keep watching with this movie 's 
random rrip down memory lane 
(what 'S left of it anyway). From 
beer bong and fra ts to marriage 
counselors and Iuds - there 's a 
comedic reference to anytlung and

REVIEW 

everything. The most typical (and 
predictable) siruations are told in 
the most atypical of ways, keeping 
the audience guessing about what 
the movie holds next. 

As for the technical aspects, 
even the photographic techniques 
and sounds are utilized to create a 
comedic masterpiece . Switching 
camera angles , views and even 
voice speed make the movie flow 
nicely into each trip or scene. The 
writing i sarcastic, with a bit of 

slapstick weaved in to create the 
right kind of comedy that keeps the 
mind alert yet entertained . 

So if there's a part inside that 
enjoyed "Van Wilder," loves "Fast 
Times at Ridgemont High" and 
can't get enough of "10 Things I 
Hate About You," hold the phone, 
cancel all appointments and make a 
date with "Old School."

THUR DAY, FEBRUARY ZO, ZDe3 THE U D GUAR DIAN SPORTS IS 

CLUB SPORTS 
WOMEN'S RUGBY 

Les:. than a week after the 'Triton 's suc-
cessful 2-0 road trip to Arizona, they again 
faced Arizona ta te and the nl\'ersity of 
Arizona at home. UCSO women's rugby 
played a doubleheader on Feb. 15, and by the 
end of the day, had chnched the league title 
and ~Iaranteed its right to compete at the 
2003 OIVl,ion I j aoonal . 

In the first game, a 35-0 rout of ASU, 
the Triton forward pack set thc pace and 
mtenSity of the game . UCSO head coach 
Hoova mith later commented on th e 
Importance of a good forward game; the 
forwards reall}, determllle who win the 
game, but the back determi ne by how 
much . Early on, it wa apparent that the 
forwa rds had come to play an aggres ive, 
hard-hitting gam e. T he A U pack could do 
Ir ttle to compete wi th C D 's ruc ks, 
cru ms and tenacious Ir neouts. 

Roo kie forward Emily O gata had an e pe-
cia lly Strong kicking gam e, h elping the 
T rito ns advance down the field with long 
penalty kicks. The backs, who dominated last 
week's play, took advantage of key opportuni-
ties to widen the lead. Sophomore TIki 
H ayes consistently broke through th e 
defense, scoring four tries on the day. As a 
team , the forwards and backs combined in 
unyielding defense that afforded ASU no 
chance to score. 

Agai nst the W ildcats, the Tritons 
sh owed no signs of fatigue and never le t up. 
T he back line was much stronger in the 
second game, evidenced by the final score 
of 53-0. 

U CSO will be hosting its bracket o f the 
na tional championships for the first time in 
school history. This stands to give the Triton 
wo m en the homefield advantage at the com -
peti tion in mid-April. Last year, the Tritons 
were defeated only by N o. I-ranked Air 
Fo rce. 

MEN'S RUGBY 
UCSD men's rugby improved itli league 

record to 2-3 with a 36- 12 win over Long 
Beach SllIte on Feb. 1 s. 

After a somewhat slow starr to the 
match , UCSO 's N ick Serrato toole the ball 
off the back of a scrum and drove through 
the Long Beach defense for the day's first 
try. Winger Kevin Hannigan added the 
conversion to put UCSD ahead 7 -0. 

At the 20- minute mark, UCSD struck 
twI ce in succession , with flyh31f M ike 
M eissner and fullback Todd Gl eed both 
scoring to put U CSD comfortabl y ahead 
17 -0. After surrendering a forward try to 
the 4gers, UCSO captain Matt jones dove 
across the line, and with the Hanmgan con -
version, ended the first half with UCSO in 
th e lead 26-5. 

T he second half was played mostl y in 
the Long Beach end , with the Triton s 
un able to sustain theIr drrves long eno ugh 
to ge t any po ints. H owever, in the 55 th 

minute, j ones dove over for his second try 
o n the day to put UCSO ahead 31-5. After 
su rrenderi ng ano ther 4ger tr y, Tri ton 
winger Tom FIOre cored his first t ry o f the 
eason to end t he day with UCSO up 36-

12. 
ult was good to get back to winnin g, and

UCSO coach Eric Takeuc hi . " ext week will 
be a big challenge for us in Cal Po ly I an

years and have

UCSD sailing now 
look forward to its 
next competition,

weekend at UC Irvine. 

WRESTLING 
Despite several mild performances and 

canceled tournamentli at the stan of the sea-
son, UCSD wrestling has finally emerged as 
a team to be reckoned with after its strong 
showing at the San jose SllIte Dual Meet 
Championships. 

In the first match against San jose State, 
U C 0 quickly gathered points when its 
wre tiers expertly dismantled itli opponentli. 
Brent Mori got a pin in the IH-pound 
weight class at the 5:30 mark, as did Quiche 
Roura in the I 57-pound class at 3:27 . 

UCSD wrestler Eric Smith also won 
with a technical pin, 16-0, and Kyle 
Kl ienschmidt wrestled to a ma jor decision 
win of 14-5. At this point, UCSO and Sj U 
were tied 21 -21 , with only a few heavy-
weight competitions remaining. 

This was tough for UCSO, since many 
of its heavy wrestlers were out on injuries. 
However, if the Tritons succeeded in get-
ting one pin, they could once again tie the 
competition. 

It was up to Dave Hall , who wrestles in 
the 197 -pound weight class, to get this pin; 
after wrestling to just eight seconds shy of 
the time limit, Hall pinned his opponent 
for the win, tying SjSU overall. However, 
the judges determined SJSU was the win-
ner of the tie, since it had fewer forfeits, 
although UC 0 matched it equally in vic-
tories and pins. 

Coming off the disappointing loss, the 
Tritons performed in their second match 
against Utah to claim a third-place finish at the 
tournament Solid perfonnances against Uuh 
included a quick pin by Mori after only 50 sec-
onds, and a pin by Kliensdunidt after 4:30. 

The wrestling team is still looking for 
more members, especially since its forfeits 
ultimately COSt it the win. 

WOMEN'S ULTIMATE 
The UCSO ultimate Frisbee women's divi -

sion hosted 16 teams from all over the United 
Sates and Canada as pan of the annual 
President's Day tournament this past weekend. 

Competition highlights included UCSD 
pulling out a comeback win against University 
of British Columbia, with the Tritons making 
an 8 -0 run to overcome a 7 -3 deficit. The play 
on Feb. 16 was also highlighted by strong wins 
in UCSD's first two games over Oregon and 
UC Sana Cruz, though a loss to UC Davis 
finished out the day. 

The quarterfinal game on Feb. 17 was 
against the Tritons' regional rival, 
Colorado. After losing to it twice last season, 
UCSD was determined to win, and with the 
use of a grea t zone defense, pulled out a 9-8 
victory. Unfortunately, after a long game 
against Colorado, UCSD was no match for 
Sanford in the semifinals, losing 14-5. 

The Tritons' success was due in large 
part to the play of the rookies, notably 
Manish3 Oaryani , Alia Shoettgen and 
Laura Weiss. 

UCSO will next play at the Stanford 
Invitational in two weeks, when it will poten-
tially get to rematch both UC Davis and 
Sanford.

Men's tennis wins three matches to earn tournament title 
By CYNTHIA CHAVEl 

Staff Writer 

Playing away from home can 
be seen as a disadvantage due to 
unfamiliar territory and fewer 
fans rooti ng for the vi iring team. 

ot so for the UC D men' ten-
niS team, which has beaten the 
odds and won five of it last SIX 
matche on the road . 

The Tritons, ranked o. 23 in 
Divi Ion II, stretched their wIn-
ning streak to five with decisIve 
victones against Vanguard, 

onoma State Univer icy and Cal

ment title for the first time. 

"I'm happy with the resul t 
and wnh everyone glVll1g a good 

effort,~ said UC D head coach 
Enc teldlmayer. 

On Feb. 14, the Triton 
squared off first against Vanguard 
UniverSIty, sweeping It 9-0. The 
doubles team of JUl1lor ameer 
Chopra and sophomore Brya n 

watt won their match -2, fol-
lowed by junior Jeff \ il on and 
wphomore ick Morton, who 
won -3. Rounding out the dou -
bles sweep were junior ean 

agel and enior Mike Meyer 
wIth an -0 victory.

(6-3, 2-6, 6-3), Swart (6-1, 6-4), 
Wilson (6-1, 6-4), sophomore 

Emil ovak (6-0, 6-1) and junior 
Blake Wilson-Hayden (6-0, 6-0). 

"Although [Vanguard) was the 
weaker team, we still had to stay 
focused becau e we knew they 
wanted to beat us," wan sa Id . 

On Feb. 15, UC D faced off 
against Sonoma tate and 
destroyed the eawolves -\. 
The double pairs of Chopra and 

watt , Meyer and agel, and 
\Vilson and Tomas ovak edged 
out theIr opponents with scores 
of 8-5, -6 and -1, respectively. 

"Tommy , ovak played well 111 
his doubles match ," Steidlmayer 
aid of the fre hman. "He really 

showed a lot of energy." 
UC D took five of six in sin-

gles, with the only 10 s by 
Chopra, who fought hard but lost 
6-2, 3-6 and 6-4. The Triton 
recorded victories from ,\leyer 
(6-0, 6-4), watt (6-2, 6-0), 
\ Vii on (6- 1, 6-4), Emil ovak 
(7-6, 6-1) and \Vil on-Ilayden

"While it is always an honor

T he sport of boxing has been tailspinl1lng toward chaos recently. Boxing 
has featured some of the world's 
best sports figures, such a. 
Muhammed Ali, and it now fea-
tures and suffers from the world's 
most idiotic characters, such as 
Mike Tyson. 

Tyson has been scheduled to 
fight Clifford Etienne on Feb. 22 
in Memphis, 1cnn. But this for -
mer heavyweight champion, who 
has never made a strong commit-
ment to the heavyweight bout, 
actua lly stood up hi trainer at the 
gym for three straight days before 
missing two flights to Memphis 
this past weekend . J Ie said he had 
flu-like symptoms ovcr the week -
end, but it looks like he might 
have just been a little shy of sobri -
ety and II1stead got a large tribal 
motif tattoo that wraps around his 
left eyc.
