The launching was not a sur-

think tha t China may be able to 
put humans in space as early as 
next year.

Students Light Up for the Homeless 
VIGIL: CalPIRG raises awareness for hunger and poverty in San Diego 
By JANE KIM 
Staff Writer 

Approximately 20 students 
lit up the foggy Price Center 
plaza in hopes of raising aware-
ness about homelessness while 
many people were rocking with 
the Goo Goo Dolls at RlMAC 
Arena Thursday night. Jim 
Stephens, founder of Food for 
Thought, a food collection 
agency for the homeless, 
addressed the problem of 
homelessness in San Diego 
after the candlelight vigil, 
which was sponsored by 
UCSD's California Public 
Interest Research Group 
(CaIPIRG). 

"One out of five children 
live in poverty in California," 
said Noah Greer, UCSD's chap-

ter chair of CaIPIRG. "We want 
people to hear about the prob-
lems we have in San Diego and 
some possible solutions." 

According to CaIPIRG, 27 
million Americans are affected 
by hunger and nearly 3,000 
~ple are homeless in San 
Diego. 

Stephens began his message 
by sharing his personal experi-
ence of living on the streets. 

Once a Wall Street profes-
sional, Stephens became home-
less by choice in 1992, camping 
out in San Diego for an entire 
year. 

"I've never been so miser-
able in my life," Stephens said. 
"1 had no ability to go to the 
bathroom whenever I wanted, 
and I was forced to dig in 
dumpsters." 

Although no longer home-
less, Stephens recounted his life 
on the street. 

"As a homeless person, you 
have no private life because 
you're living in the public," he 
said. "You' re living under 
bridges, in crevices and moving 
from one place to another; 
wherever you can go that' s 
open for 24 hours." 

In many instances, he 
added, homeless people end up 
in warm, well-lit, 24-hour adult 
bookstores, where they don' t 
have to worry about being 
kicked out. 

Seven years ago, Stephens 
started Food For Thought, 
which fed as many as 500 
homeless people per day for six

Expert 
Discusses 
Smoking 
LECTURE: Richard Doll 
di scu sed links between 
lifestyle and cancer 
PETE PRATO 
Staff Writer 

Richard Doll, one of the 
world's leadi ng authorities on the 
link between smoking and cancer, 
discllssed his efforts and discov-
eries in the fie ld of cancer preven-
tion before an audience of over 
200 San Diegans last Tuesday. 

Doll, this yea r 's Maurice and 
Chamaine Kaplan Distinguished 
Lecturer in Cancer Prevention, 
came from Oxford, England to 
give the lectu re. 

Doll has devoted his life to the 
study of cancer, and more specifi-
cally, how lifestyles figure into 
both developing cancer and cur-
ing it. 

At the lecture, Doll com-
pressed SO years of research and 
accomplishments in the area of 
ca ncer into not much more than 
an hour 's time. He described for 
the audience a brief history of 
how ca ncer research came about, 
along with the desi re to find the 
controllable causes of cancer. 

Of these controllable ca uses of 
ca ncer, "Tobacco is by far the 
most important," Doll said . 

He added tha t apart from 
smoking, diet is the most impor-
tant fac tor behind cancer, even 
though it is stil l very difficult to 
es tablish dist inctive links 
between the two. 

In 1950, Doll published one of 
two papers that would be land-
marks in the effort to establish a 
link between tobacco and cancer, 
prOViding the fi rst clear evidence 
tha t smoking does in fac t cause 
lung cancer. 

Over time, Doll's work uncov-
ered more health consequences of 
smoking such as heart attack, vas-
cular disease and emphysema. 
His 1994 report on a 40-rear fo l-
low-up of a group 0 30,000 
British doctors is considered the 
definit i ve paper on the health 
consequences of smoking. 

Don said that the progress of 
research over the last SO years has 
been slow. 

He said that one of the first 
crucial events in cancer research 
came with the discovery of the 
genetic code in the 195Os, which 
proved that cancer was a result of 
mutations. This discovery then 
led to a situation where large sec-
tions of the population became 
overly worried about cancer-
causing risks. 

The presence of many differ-
ent carcinogens in smoke provid-
ed evidence that directed Doll 
and many other doctors in their 
research. Intensive testing of car-

HOMELESS: 
Food For Thought is 
collecting donations 
COIItInued from ..... 1 
months. He also fought for open-
ing 24-hour homefess shelters 
with real beds, sheets, pillows 
and covers. Although the city 
now offers several inclement 
weather shelters annually, 
Stephens said that in the past, the 
shelters did not open unless the 
weather was below 40 degrees. 

Currently, Stephens works in 
conjunction with the annual 
inclement weather shelters by 
providing food, clothing and 
money for the homeless popula-
tion every winter. 

As Stephens went on describ-
ing ways students can get 
involved, what was supposed to 
be a 20-minute talk continued for 
almost an hour, captivating the 
interest of those present. 

Arash Kolahi, a third-year 
Marshall student on his way to 
the library, said he planned on 
staying only for a few minutes. 

"1 was so engaged by the 
speaker that I decided to stay for 
the whole time," he said. 

As the chair of Students for 
Social Justice on campus, Kolahi 
agreed with Stephens on the 
problem of ignorance and apathy 
on this issue. 

"There definitely needs to be a 
raiSing of awareness, especially 
in La Jolla," he said. "This is such 
a wealthy area that homelessness 
is forgo lien. " 

Kolahi said he wanted 
Students for Social Justice to par-
ticipate in fighting homelessness 

and in Food For Thought. 
Muir senior Adam Leising is 

another student who was 
touched by the plight of the 
homeless. 

"1 feel like when I walk down 
the street and see a homeless per-
son, I can't even look at them in 
the face," he said. 

Leising, a student from an 
upper-middle class background, 
said he even considered going 
homeless temporarily to gain a 
beller understanding of what 
homeless people experience. 

"1 feel bad when I'm in my car, 
have money in my pocket, places 
to go and things to do, and then I 
see a homeless man on the street," 
he said. "1 feel bad because I don't 
know what's going through his 
mind. I'm also interested in what 
these people are like, how ther. 
got on the street, if they chose It 
and if so, why?" 

Stephens offered ways in 
which students can care for and 
encourage the homeless to re-
enter society. 

"Every year, I come out to the 
UCSD Library Walk 30 days 
before the shelters open to collect 
small change, canned food and 
clothes," he said. "We use the 
money we collect to give the 
homeless a telephone line and 
postal address so that they have a 
number and address to write on 
their applications when they 
apply for jobs. We also give them 
clothes to wear to job interviews 
and two bags full of groceries 
when they leave the shelter." 

UCSD Food For Thought will 
be on Library Walk Monday 
through Friday until Dec. 15, col-
lecting food, clothing and money 
for the homeless.

4 OPfNION The UCSD Guardian Monday. November 22, 1999 

By PAR.ISA BAHAR.IAN. 
STAFF WR.ITER. 

Despite protests, the officers involved in the shooting of 
Demetrius DuBose acted according to procedure . 

When former Notre Dame and Tampa Bay football player Demetrius DuBose was killed by two white police officers during a violent con-
frontation in July, the black community 
erupted, saying the killing was racially 
motivated . Now, after three intense 
months of investigations, District 
Attorney Paul Pfingst ruled that the 
officers' actions were justified and that 
his office would not charge the men 
with DuBose's death. 

However, some members of the 
black community continu'e to believe 
that the confrontation between DuBose 
and the police resulted in a fatal shoot-
ing only because DuBose was black. 
John Johnson, president of San Diego's 
Urban League - a non-profit agency 
whose stated mission is to provide 
equal opportunities to African 
Americans - posed this question after 
Pfingst's decision to not prosecute the 
officers for the killing of DuBose: 
"Would [DuBose] have been killed if he 
had been white? Of course not." 

Unfortunately, Johnson is blinded by 
his own prejudices, for if one takes a 
careful and unbiased look at the situa-
tion the police officers were in and the 
threat DuBose posed, it seems likely 
that he may have been killed even if he 
had been white. 

On July 24, Charles Flynn was alone 
in his apartment when he heard foot-
steps in the bedroom above him . Upon 
investigating, Flynn found a stranger in 
his bed, who then escaped through the 
balcony. Flynn reported the intruder to 
the police and informed them that the 
man appeared to be under the influence 
of drugs or alcohol. 

When Officers Keating and Wills 
arrived to the report of a burglary in 
progress, Flynn was talking to the 
intruder, who was identified as 
DuBose. 

Keating asked DuBose if he had 
been arrested before. DuBose mumbled 
that he had been arrested for possession 
of controlled substances. 

"When he [mumbled]," Keating said, 

" the only way I could describe it is the 
hair on the back of my neck stood up, 
because I realized that he was under the 
ir.fluence of PCP." 

The officers recognized the situa-
tion's potential for violence, as drugs 
similar to PCP render users unable to 
feel physical pain, and told DuBose 
they were going to handcuff him while 
they continued their investigation. 

What followed seems to be a scene 
out of a bad action movie rather than a 
real-life situation. 

DuBose, refusing to comply, walked 
away. Wills doused DuBose with pep-
per spray, but this had no effect. 
Keating jumped on DuBose's back as he 
took off running. DuBose grabbed 
Keating by his shirt and pitched him 
head first into a cement planter box. 

The officers took up pursuit of 
DuBose, following him north on 
Mission Boulevard in Mission Beach. 
Suddenly, they came upon DuBose "all 
bulked up in a fighting-type stance." 
Keating said. "You know, legs planted 
on the ground," Yet the officers didn't 
open fire and slaughter the man; they 
continued to try to subdue DuBose 
through non.lethal methods. 

Wills and Keating alternately struck 
DuBose with their nunchakus, martial 
arts weapons that fall short of lethal 
force. This did no damage to DuBose, 
for he managed to overpower both offi-
cers and yank both their nunchakus 
awar from them. . 

" started screaming at the suspect to 
drop, drop the sticks, drop the Slicks, 
urn, he tumed and looked at me and 
there was nothing in his face, it was just 
a blank nothing there," Keating said. 

The 6'2" man weighing 240 pounds 
started swinging the officers' nun-
chakus, which can be lethal even if used 
by someone who is untrained in their 
use, and advanced to within 10 feet of 
them. 

If an armed man almost twice your 
size was coming at you and the only 
weapon you had to defend yourself and 
the people on the busy street was a pis-
tol, what would you do? 

The officers warned DuBose again to 

drop his weapons, but he kept coming 
forward . The officers, when they per-
ceived danger to themselves and to the 
people around them, were forced to 
react as they were trained to: They 
opened fire . 

Now the controversy: There were 12 
shots fired, four of which struck 
DuBose in the back. The leaders of the 
black community seized on these facts, 
saying the officers used unnecessary 
force because DuBose was black and 
that they purposefully shot him in the 
back. 

Sergeant Reggie Frank, officer safety 
instructor and range master for the San 
Diego Police Department, said officers 
are trained to "shoot to stop the threat" 
and to continue shooting until there 
ceases to be a threat. Frank also 
explained that. although the officers 
began firing at the front of DuBose 
(substantiated by the statements of 21 
witnesses), the four bullets likely 
lodged in his back because of the invol-
untary movement of the subject's body 
caused by the impact of the bullets. 

No matter how much smoke the 
leaders of the black community claim to 
see, the fire of racism is not present in 
the DuBose incident. This is not a case 
of two white cops slaughtering an inno-
cent black man. DuBose was not an 
upstanding citizen that night. The toxi-
cology report showed that DuBose had 
alcohol, cocaine and the drug ecstasy in 
his system when he died, bearing out 
Keating's initial assessment that 
DuBose was under the influence of 
some manner of illegal substance. 

DuBose would still be alive today if 
he had not decided to mix large 
amounts of drugs and commit the 
crime of breaking and entering. DuBose 
would still be alive if he had not repeat-
edly fought with the officers, who gave 
him every chance to surrender. DuBose 
would still be alive if he had not run 
from the cops. These are the facts. 

Do not blame the officers for 
DuBose's death. Put the blame where it 
belongs - in the cold earth where 
DuBose now lays for eternity.

Fascist Conspiracy Found Brewing at UCSD 
COMMENTARY: Housing crunch should not be solved by severing on-campus housing guarantee for second-year students 
By BRENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

As college students, we are 
entitled to a certain amount of 
light-hearted distrust. It is only 

. natural to harbor a certain 
amount of suspicion toward the 
people who take thou$ilnds of 
dollars from us and practically 
hold our futures in the palms of 
their hands. This distrust gi~es 
rise to innocent quips about the 
faculty and administration at 
our school, and to the formula-
tion of theories about their 
underhanded dealings with cor-
porate America, the Illuminati 
and the .people who killed 
Kennedy Oohn, Robert or John 
Jr.- take your pick). 

Lately I have started to sus-
pect that there may actually be a 
bit of truth to some of these sus-
picions. Recent events have led 
me to the conclusion that certain 
members of the UC administra-
tion are in fact evil. I don't mean 
evil in a monopolistic, manipu-
lative way like Rupert Murdoch 
or Bill Gates. I don't even mean 
it in an insidious, annoying cult-
of-worship way like Pikachu or 
Britney Spears. I mean good old-
fashioned, brain-washing, pro-

pag~ndist evil, like GoebbeIs or 
Stahn. . 

What ti~ped me off was the 
university s decision to stop 
guaranteeing on-campus hous-
ing to ~phomores. I wasn't 
immediately aware of this new 
policy because, not surprisingly, 
the administration didn't exactly 
try to call a lot of attention to the 
fact that it was quietly shooing 

second-year students off cam-
pus. Like any shrewd masters of 
misinformation, it made sure 
only to espouse the positive 
results: "Housing on campus 
has improved dramatically this 
year; occupancy has been cut 
from 108 percent to 102 per-
cent!" Yeah, that's because you 
kicked a couple hundred people 
off campus: you jerks. 

Granted, on-campus housing 
isn't exactly like staying at the 
Imperial Suite at Mandalay Bay. 
The cafeterias only ge! the meat 
the state penitentiaries don't 
want, the blueprints for the 
apartments were chosen from an 
architectural contest for the best 
walk-in closet design and show-
ering carries the constant threat 
of contracting some exotic foot 
fungus. But hell, it's convenient, 
it makes it easy to stagger home 
after Sun God, aod it can be 
called home. 

Now the administration wants 
to take that away from sopho-
mores. It wants to drive all of 
these poor, innocent undercJass.: 
men out into the cut-throat San 
Diego housing market a year ear-
lier, just so the university won't 
have to deal with its own hOUSing 
problem. Look, punks, I have a 
hard enough time competing 
with families and lawyers for 
houses - I don't need you to 
dump another 3,000 desperate 
college students into the real 
estate arena. 

Sophomores should not stand 
for this. Don't you people want 
the luxury of being able to wake 
up five minutes before class and 
sprinting to lecture in your

Internet porn you'd miss out on. 
The history of the administra-

tion's treatment of students on 
this campus reads like a manual 
for running totalitarian states. So 
far, the powers that be have suc-
ceeded in registering every stu-
dent in order to track their move-
ments and activities (you don't 
really believe they issued you an 
1.0. so that you could check out 
library books and go to RIMAC, 
do you?), they have constrained 
the ability of students to travel 
(convenient how all the new 
parking lots are located out in the 
boondocks and force you to rely 
on shuttles, isn't it?) and now 
with this housing policy they 
have started to strip the rights of 
students to live where they were 
once welcomed. 

This is only the beginning. 
We need only to look at history 
to understand what to expect 
next. Nazi Germany, Soviet 
Russia, Italy under Mussolini, 
Spain under Franco - the past is 
ripe with examples. Wake up, 
people! It's only a matter of time 
before they start stamping bar 
codes on our foreheads. 

I can see where this is lead-
ing. In an effort to improve the 
overall academic achievement of 
the UCSD student population, 
the univerSity wi\1 start kicking 
out a\1 the people who don't 
have at least a 3.0. You had all 
better start studying harder, 
'cause that C+ in Chem 6B just 
isn't going to cut it anymore. 

Or suppose the administra-
tion decides it wants to fix the 
diversity problem on this cam-
pus. The solution would be sim-

pie to such an adminis tration -
just kick out a bunch of the 
white and Asian kids. (A t this 
point I would like to point out to 
the administration that my fami-
ly is of Spanish descent, and as 
such it is entirely possible that 
several of my ancestors were 
Moorish .) 

It doesn't stop with the stu-
dents either. With the rapidly 
dwindling student population, 
the administrators will be free 10 
kick out any faculty members 
that aren't up to snuff: "Our fac-
ulty is composed entirely of 
Nobel Laureates. No, I'm seri-
ous; all three of them have won 
the Nobel Prize." 

This is not the way campus 
problems should be handled . 
The real way to improve hous-
ing on campus is not to lower 
our standards, but to do some-
thing about the problem. Those 
of you who are freshmen should 
especially take note, because 
next year you're the ones who 
will get the shaft. 

Let your voice be heard; tell 
the university's administrators 
that second-year students 
deserve the right to live on cam-
pus .if they so desire. Tell them 
that doing so will take pressure 
off of San Diego's over-taxed traf-
fic grid by reducing the amount 
of student commuters. Tell them 
that they will encourage more 
studying by keeping students on 
campus. Say you' re allergic to the 
water in C1airemonl if you have 
to - beg them, bribe them, lie to 
them - I don't care. Just don't let 
them do this.

Revenge and Intolerance Reign Over 
Kosovo Despite International Presence 

PRISfINA, Kosovo - Five 
months after NATO forces 
moved in to take absolute con-
trol of Kosovo, there is little elec-
tricity and an inconstant water 
supply, the streets are full of 
garbage, traffic is in chaos with-
out working stop lights or police 
direction, few cars have license 
plates, and no one has new iden-
tity papers. 

Hundreds of thousands of 
Albanians driven out by the 
Serbs have returned from 
refugee camps, and the Serbian 
and Gypsy minorities continue 
to be harassed and attacked. The 
U.N. government here, starved 
of funds by the countries that 
fought and won the war, is 
unable to pay salaries even to 
the public employees it is sup-
posed to control. 

Justice is rare and court trials 
nearly nonexistent, so few are 
punished; robberies, apartment 
thefts, extortion and even mur-
ders take place with near 
impunity, some of it a function 
of organized crime. There are 
only 1,700 international police 
officers to provide security, and 
the patrols of the NATO-led 
peacekeeping force are generally 

static and unaggressive. 
The burning of Serbs' homd 

takes place almost daily in an

The buming of Serbs' 
homes takes place 
almost daily in an

years of repression. 

minority to flee the province or 
ghettoize itself in enclaves, sur-
rounded by hostile Albanians 
who remember their own years 
of repression. 

President Clinton, who will 
visit Kosovo for a few hours on 
Tuesday to thank U.S. troops 
and wish them a happy 
Thanksgiving at their huge and 

heavily secured base, Camp 
Bondsteel, will see little of 
today's Kosovo. 

Criticism of the situation here 
comes from Albanians, Serbs 
and many international agen-
cies, and the mood among the 
staff of the U.N. mission in 
Kosovo, the transitional govern-
ment run by Bernard Kouchner, 
is beleaguered and somber. 

Kouchner and his aides say 
their main problem is the simple 
lack of financial support from 
the same Western alliance that 
won the war. 

There have been long and bit-
ter discussions between Pristina 
and European and U.S. officials 
about how to get the $25 million 
needed to cover this year's short-
fall and the estimated $150 mil-
lion gap in next year's budget for 
the U.N. mission in Kosovo. 

"That's the price of half a 
day's bombing," a senior U.N. 
official said with real rancor in 
his voice. "The West has got to 
invest in the peace or this place 
will fail. And, no one wants it to 
fail more than Siobodan 
Milosevic."

The spaceflight was kept 
secret until its successful conclu-

released . 

China has been stung in recent 
years by accusations that it stole 
U.s. rocket and nuclear-bomb 
secrets, and this weekend's 21 -
hour flight was being trumpeted 
as a validation of indigenous sci-
ence. 

But David the flight, and the 
reported excite-

the Chinese peo-
ple, practically 
took over Sunday

6:30 a.m. on Saturday from a pad 
in the northwestern province of

After completing 14 orbits at 

an altitude of about 186 miles, the 
craft received a signal from a ship 
to slow down, arced toward earth 
and parachuted to a landing zone 

control. The Long March rockets, 
used to put satellites as well as 
the spacecraft into orbit on 
Saturday, are nearly identical to 
the Dong Feng intercontinental 
ballistic missiles in China's 
nuclear forces, Shambaugh said.

Mass Suicide Victims' 
Belongings Auctioned 

Industry Fails to Meet Target 
SAN DIEGO - Many of the 

items on the block were ordinary 
enough: a plastic laundry ham-
per, ' card tables, camping gear, 
clothes, tools, cookbooks, a 
sewing machine. Only a few - a 
voluminous collection of books 
about UFOs, 20 metal-frame bunk 
beds, a pair of black Nike sneak-
ers - offered a hint of their 
macabre Origins. 

The items auctioned by county 
officials on Saturday were the last 
earthly possessions of the 39 
members of the Heaven's Gate 
cult who killed themselves nearly 
three years ago in hopes of board-
ing a spaceship that they believed 
was trailing the Hale-Bopp 
comet. It was one of the largest 
mass suicides in U.S. history. 

The belongings on sale offered 
no insight into what had led their 
former owners to believe that the 
path to the heavens began with a . 
lethal mix of barbiturates, vodka 
and apple sauce. 

There were 183 lots, which

BUSH: 
Officials have not

meet with the Log Cabin 
Republicans, an organization of 
Republican homosexuals with 
whom Bush's chief rival for the

Arizona, recently met. He added 
that he opposed not only gay 
marriage but also adoption · by 
gay partners. 

"[ believe that society ought to 
aim for the ideal," Bush said. 
"And the ideal is for a man and 
woman Lo adopt children." 

This was Bush's first appear-
ance during his presidential cam-
paign on a Sunday morning talk 
show, and it underscored many 
of his SOCially conservative 
views, including his faith in 
abstinence as an antidote to teen-

and three cars. 

About 375 people came to bid 
with a mix of gallows humor, 
indifference and ignorance. Their 
reasons for bidding ranged from 
basic need to morbid curiosity to 
commercial intent. 

The curators of the Museum of

The bodies of the cult members

Still, Bush was careful, as he 

has been in the past, to suggest 
that he is more interested in 
extolling his views through the 
bully pulpit than in imposing 
them through law. 

On abortion, for example, 
Bush said, HI would support a 
constitutIonal amendment with 
the exceptions of life, incest and 
rape. I want to tell you some-
thing, though. The country is not 
ready for a constitutional amend-
ment. 

"There is no chance, at this 
moment, that there be a two-
thirds vote out of the House and 
Senate," Bush continued, refer-
ring to the votes needed to pass 
an amendment, as opposed to the 
simple majority required for pas-
sage of a bill. "What I will do is 
promote life as president of the 
United States."

After scrambling to adopt a 
technical standard for sales of 
music online, record companies 
and hardware makers last sum-
mer said they had paved the 
way for Christmas sales of 
portable digital players. But the 
holidays are ringing in a reality: 
Neither the tunes nor the players 
will be in place to make this the 
first big digital music Christmas. 

Underscoring the delay, Sony 
EIec1ronics, a consumer electron-
ics bellwether, last week intro-
duced its digital music player, 
the Memory Stick Walkman, but 
said that it would not be on sale 
until January. Meanwhile, major 
music companies say thilt the 
delay in adopting standards -
along with logistical challenges 
- has forced them to abandon 
their one-time goal of making 
much of their music available 
over the Internet by Christmas. 

The delays suggest the com-
plexity of the still evolving tech-
nical standards being developed 
by the recording industry's 
Secure Digital Music Initiative, 
and they hint at continued 

uncertainty for consumers. 
They also reflect competing 

interests. The music companies 
fear that insecure digital players 
will lead to rampant piracy of 
music downloaded from the 
Internet, while the consumer 
electronics industry sees the dig-
ital players merely as heir to the 
portable cassette and compact 
disc player. 

In fact, a final agreement on 
the first phase of the specifica-
tions being developed by the 
Secure Digital Music Initiative, 
or SDMI, is not even scheduled 
to be signed until next week. 

Initiative officials plan to 
meet in Maui, Hawaii, on Dec. 1 
to sign a contract with Aris 
Technologies Inc., which makes 
a key screening technology for 
the portable devices. 

More than two dozen portable 
digital players that record music 
on tiny hard drives are already 
on the market. But those players 
are not yet fully compatible with 
the technical standards, and it is 
unclear how many of them will 
be able to be upgraded once the 

new standards are in place. If 
they ultimately cannot meet 
SDMI specifications, -they would 
not be able to play the newest 
music - either downloaded 
from the Internet or "ripped" 
from compact discs. 

What has made the issue so 
pressing from a music industry 
perspective is that the download-
ing of music from the Internet has 
gathered momentum. College 
students in particular, a huge 
music audience, have taken 
advantage of the Internet to trade, 
download and listen to music 
online in a format called MP3, 
opening both a massive opportu-
nity and a potential Achilles' heel 
for music companies. 

The great fear of the music 
industry - and of some musi-
cians - is that the existing MP3 
technology makes it possible for 
people to trade and distribute 
music freely, in blatant violation 
of copyright laws and possibly 
costing the companies tens of 
millions of dollars in lost sales.

Gates Donates $26 Million to Fight Tetanus 
An American support group 

for Unicef, the U.N. children's 
fund, announced Sunday that it 
has received its largest donation 
ever, a grant of $26 million from 
the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation earmarked for the 
elimination of tetanus among 
babies and their mothers in the 
poorest nations. 

Nearly 250,000 people, most 
of them mfants, died of tetanus 
in the developing world in 
1998, according to the U.S. 
Committee for Unicef, the 
American support group and 
the oldest of Unicef's 37 nation-
al ,upport committees. Only 
one newborn infant died of 
tetanus in the United States in 
the same year, the committee 
said. 

The grant from the founda-
tion, which was created by 
Gates, the chairman and co-
founder of the Microsoft Corp., 
is intended to make immuniza-

tions more widely available to 
the~r. 

, Unicef and others have 
strategies for dealing with 
neonatal tetanus," Charles J. 
Lyons, president of the U.S. 
committee and a former Unicef 
official, said in an interview on 
Thursday. "We're down to 57 
countries, 27 of which account 
for 90 percent of cases. But there 
was no movement on that 
because the resources weren't 
there." 

The campaign to eliminate 
neonatal tetanus received its 
first pledge of assistance in 1998 
from Becton, Dickinson & Co., a 
leading maker of syringes, 
which offered donations of 
equipment and some funds. The 
Gates grant, Lyons said, is 
expected to prompt more dona-
tions because people like to be 
part of a demonstrably success-
ful project. 

Unicef says that its campaign 

can effectively eliminate neona-
tal tetanus as a health hazard if 
the organization can raise $100 
million to inoculate 100 million 
women by 2005. 

Mothers in poor nations 
become infected by the tetanus 
bacteria through unsterilized 
gynecological procedures or 
unsanitary conditions surround-
ing childbirth. 

Babies can be infected when 
the umbilical cord is cut, Unicef 
experts say. Death can be tor-
tured, with spasms, stiffness 
and the loss of the ability Lo 
breathe. Inoculation protects 
both the mother and her new-
born. 

Information on the tetanus 
campaign and on the disease 
itself is available on the U.S. 
Committee for Unicef's Web 
site: www.lIllicefuso.org.

SMOKING: 
Testing carcinogens 
led to discoveries 
CoIItInued from ..... 1 
cinogens had unpredicted effects 
in figuring out more about how 
cancer develops in the body and 
what causes it to develop. 

Doll devoted much of the last 
half of this century to proving 
that lifestyles - especially those 
in which smoking is an element 
-lead to many different types of 
cancers, most specifically lung 
cancer. Although detecting muta-
tions provides the ability to 
avoid some cancer, few cancer 
cases are avoided by this means. 

The Kaplan Lectureship was 
established at the UCSD Cancer 
Center by the Kaplans in 1997 to 
bring to the San Diego communi-
ty world-class lectures by leaders 
in the field of cancer rrevention. 

Doll is a fellow 0 the presti-
gious Royal Society of London. 
In 1957, Doll was elected a fellow 
of the Royal College of 
PhYSicians. He was later elected 
a fellow of the Royal Society of 
Medicine. 

"It's been great fun," Doll said 
when thanked for pursuing his 
research and devoting himself to 
what he loves. "And if you can 
gain something from it all, then 
that's good too."

The diverse group of individuals on the Marketing Council use the successes of 

the UCSD community to increase private support and alumni allegiance, to 
support academic and social programs, to enhance recruitment of faculty, 

and to build a strong foundation for future UCSD students, 

Story by Candice Lee, Contributing Staff Writer 

W
hile most UCSD students are unaware of 
its existence, the UCSD Marketing 
Council has been on the rise since its 
inception in 1986, creating various 
mechanisms to promote the university 
in its entirety. 

The achievements of the Marketing 
Council are continuously growing. Tile UCSD SI,olVcase 
newsletter, the council 's newsletter that features infor-
mational articles and a calendar of events, is distrib-
uted throughout La Jolla a'nd Solana Beach. The Mar-
keting Council worked with the UCSD Publications 
Office to create the famous logo of Geisel Library, unit-
ing and promoting the image of the university. It also 
has members on UCSD committees, including the 
Transportation Policy Committee and Signage Com-
mittee. 

The Marketing Council has created UCSD Web sites 
that have a consistent format and that maximize the 
visibility and non-affiliate access to campus events. The 
council also helped to get Cox Cable to broadcast 
UCSD-TV by promoting the postcard campaign of 
UCSD Extension. The council uses media attention to 
publicize UCSD programs, research and successes in a 
consumer-friendly format. 

The people behind the Marketing Council include a 
diverse range of individuals from the Department of 
Alumni Relations to the Department of Web Technolo-
gy. 

Associate Athletic Director Ken Grosse finds that the 
diverse group of the Marketing Council has helped to 
maximize its success. 

"I think one thing that's important .is the way the 
Marketing Council not only brings together a diverse 
cross section of campus departments and interests, but 
how it helps fill a void the university has in terms of an 
overall marketing strategy," Grosse stated. "In its own 
way, the Marketing Council does a lot to develop at 
least some sort of consistency in how the university 
does business on and off campus as well as helping cul-
tivate campus unification and spirit." 

The unification and spirit that the Marketing Coun-
cil has succeeded in achieving is outstanding. Its ideas 
and lists of goals to build support for UCSD seem end-
less. Freshman Convocation and UCSD Open House 

are two of the many activities that the council is try-
ing to organize to promote school spirit. 

If implemented, Freshman Con-
vocation would be an event 
held during first week of Fall 
Quarter. Its main purpose 

would be to show the impor-
tance of UCSD acade-

mics, as well as to 
build school 

spirit cam-
puswide. 
The Open House will 

be an event showcasing the 
campus to the entire commu-
nity. 

While the target audi-
ence of the Marketing 
Council may be alumni and 
donors, students are its 

focus. 
Tracie Davee, member of the 

Associated Students marketing 
department, stated that the coun-

cil's major effort is "toward adding 
value and quality to students' experi-

ences here at UCSD. 
"The reason we are here is for the stu-

dents," Davee added. 
Making these concepts reality takes 

more than just idle imagination. The Mar-
keting Council meets every month, working 

on new ideas and bringing to life ideas that 
have been discussed between the individual 

committees 
Marketing Council member Lynne Peterson, 

who is acting vice chancellor of student affairs 
and who works out of the Department of Univer-

sity Events, still finds all the hard work personally 
rewarding. 

"It's empowering to see that we can make a differ-
ence," Peterson said. "We all believe in UCSD. We are 

prof~ionally sharing ideas, achieving goals. Alone we 
couldn't do it, but together it really works." 

Peterson has been on the Marketing Council since 
its creation and has watched it grow, which is why she 
is personally excited for the upcoming 40th anniver-
sary of the school. 

The Marketing Council is planning to focus on com-
munity service as the tbeme of the 40th anniversary cel-
ebration. Plans include a simple kickoff with some 
remarks by the chancellor, as well as a distribution of 
brochures outlining outreach programs countywide.

KARENTRAN 
Design Editor 

Throughout my childhood, all 
my peers have been every other 
race but Asian. 

I grew up in a white neighbor-
hood and never noticed that I was 
much different from my friends. I 
knew I was Chinese of course (all 
those years of Chinese school 
reminded me of that), but I didn't 
have a strong Asian identity. 
Aside from the occasional Chi-
nese holidays, family wagon trips 
to Chinatown and Asian markets, 
and visits with my aunts, uncles 
and cousins, my exposure to 
Asians in general was limited. 

Being Chinese was somehow a 
novelty among my friends; the 
most popular request was for me 
to say a bad word in Chinese. It 
was only in those moments that I 
felt different, marked. 

I'm in an interracial relation-
ship. I don't think I ever said that 
out loud. Normally the discourse 
is, "Yeah, I've been dating my 
boyfriend for five years now." It's 
not, ''I'm dating a white man." 

Rarely does anyone ask what 
nationality he is, and I've never 
felt obligated to divulge that 
information. His ethnicity was 
never an issue to me. It was 
assumed, of course, that I dated 
an Asian. Often my bolder 
acquaintances would say "I never 
expected your boyfriend to be 
white." I would ask them why 
because I was curious where 
these assumptions came from. 
The most frequent response was a

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 
Considering the visibility of an interracial relationship 
shrug of the shoulder. In contrast, 
an Asian man said that I looked 
like the type who would date a 
white guy. In response to this 
ignorant comment, I retorted 
with an equally ignorant, "It's 
because an Asian guy wouldn't 
be able to handle me: 

The Asian man said he was 
from a highly Asian-populated 
town and ended tilt: conversation 
with a disturbing comment that I 
still think about. 

"It's not your fault that you 
like white guys," he said. "You 
just have a propensity for that 
because of your upbringing." 

The Asian man was probably 
right about one thing: My choice 
in men would probably have 
been completely different if I had 
not lived in a predominantly 
white neighborhood. My lack of a 
strong Asian identity may have 
eased me into my boyfriend's 
family. A language barrier was 
not there, and my values are a 
blending of Chinese pragmatism 
and rugged American individual-
ism. Because I am of both worlds, 
I can transition between the two 
relatively easily. 

But at times I feel that I don't 
belong in either culture. I stick 

if he noticed from the beginning 
that we were in an interracial 
relationship. He said yes. I told 
him I never noticed it until people 
started to point it out to me. 

The discrepancy between our 
views of the relationship is due to 
the different social centers that 
we reside in. His reference point 
is one of the dominant white soci-
ety. Anything different from 
white is a minority, foreign, 
marked. My reference point is 
from a place where the presence 
of white people is so prevalent 
that whiteness is not marked. 

I've always had a diverse 

I've always had a diverse group of friends; the color issue never came up. We all 
saw each other as people with whom we got along. Adults were always the first 
ones to bring attention to the difference. The combination of whiteness as 
unmarked and my weak Asian identity resulted in my lack of awareness of the 
apparent physical differences between me and my boyfriend. 

Initially, the comment didn't 
offend me. It didn't start to offend 
me until I was driving home and 
mentally replaying my day. That 
part of it stood out. Those words 
implied so much to me. It felt like 
an assumption that I had some-
how been mismatched, like I 
made some kind of mistake 
because of ignorance, like I didn't 
know better. 

The truth is that racial aware-
ness is not something I lost sleep 
over. I went about my days glad 
to be alive, not noticing that the 
man that just walked by was 
white. I will admit, however, that 
I do notice when anyone of color 
walks by. This is because people 
of color are marked. 

In our society, whiteness is the 
reference point from which to 
gauge what you are and what 
you are not. If you are not white, 
then you must be something of 
the other, a person of color. 

out like a sore thumb in China-
town or in the Asian markets. I'm 
taller than most of the women 
and sometimes men. I walk 
around like I own the world, with 
absolutely no sense of humility 
when I talk. I speak loudly and 
confidently in fluent English. I 
speak softly and shyly in my ele-
mentary Cantonese. I dress in the 
standard issue college wear: T-
shirt and jeans. I feel like a tourist 
in Chinatown. The words over 
stores and the quick tongue 
dialects are foreign to me. From a 
distance, I fit simply because I 
have the black hair and yellow 
complexion that blends in. In 
contrast, in the English-speaking 
world, I fit in nicely. That is where 
safety is for me. 

My boyfriend, however, does 
not have the same luxury of an 
easy transition. I can exist in both 
of my worlds, but he is only 
familiar with one. I've asked him

first ones to bring attention to the

weak Asian identity resulted in 
my lack of awareness of the 
apparent physical differences 
between me and my boyfriend. It 
seems like strange logic, that for 
some reason I didn' t see he was 
white, but that was the truth. My 
relationship with him was never 
one of the Asian girl with the 
white guy, 'it was always just 
Karen and Steve. 

Steve wasn' t familiar with 
any other culture besides the one 
from home and the predomi-
nantly white neighborhood in 
which he lived. The Chinese cul-
ture was very foreign . Language 
barriers with my family, differ-
ences in ~ays of doing things 

and different values all further 
remind him that he is in an inter-
racial relationship. With my 
family, he is the marked individ-
ual, because he's the only white 
person there. However, when 
I'm with his family I fit in pretty 
easily because, aside from my 
apparent l'hysical differences, I 
speak English, have some of the 
same likes and dislikes, cele-
brate the same holidays and 
have the same values. It is no 
wonder that my boyfriend has a 
stronger sense of racial identity 
than (do. 

lt is this awareness of race that 
causes him to notice other pe0-
ple's glares as we willk through a 
Vietnamese restaurant to our 
table. I'm completely oblivious to 
this and I'm not sure if my obliv-
ion is a good thing or a bad thing. 
Noticing is only disheartening to 
me. If I give those looks a long 
enough consideration, I might 
even start to feel like I'm in the 
south. I opt to ignore the looks 
because other people's hang-ups 
don't affect me. I'm not looking for 
their approval. The main thing is 
that 1 have done right by myself, 
my relationship and my family. 
Everything else is secondary. 

The point of this long-winded 
discussion is that the race issue is 
ever present. Awareness of it is 
necessary but should not be 
debilitating to one's life. It 
shouldn't prevent you from 
doing anything you want to do or 
be with anyone you choose to be 
with. The apprecicftion of differ-
ences can make any relationship, 
whether platonic or romantic, 
even better. Through noticing the 

diff~rences and learning from 
each other 's cultures, one finds 
that deep down inside, we are all 
really the same. The common 
denominator is that everyone 
wants to be happy, healthy, loved, 
financially comfortable and able 
to retire early.

Enjoy a Non-traditional Thanksgiving Dinner Among Friends 
A menu for the alternative Thanksgiving dining experience away from home. 
By BETH ARNESE 
Food Critic 

Every Thanksgiving my uncle 
. asks me why I don't eat mashed 
potatoes. 

Then my entire family, encour-
aged by my uncle's inquiries, 
launches into an hour-long dis-
cussion of the many merits of 
mashed potatoes. 

talk to me - ever. But if you hon-
estly miss the more traditional 
appetizers, you can always order 
Friday's nine-layer dip ($6.69). 
The side of salsa accompanying 
the dip is tasteless and mild, but 
the tortilla chips are so excellent 
that you really don't even need . 
the salsa. Just the fact that there 
are two more layers than I am 
accustomed to, makes me excit-
ed. After all, the whole point of 
eating on Thanksgiving is to con-

Thanksgiving mood. While wait-
ing for the appetizers to setlle in 
your stomach before ordering the 
next course, you will have prenty 
of time to consider what you are 
thankful for in your life. It is 
important at this point to let your 
friends know ~hat you appreciate 
them as much as you have appre-
ciated your yummy appetizers. 

If you are looking for a more 
traditional Thanksgiving 
approach, I recommend that you 

addicted to this sandwich for life, 
and you may even request this 
next Thanksgiving. 

Whatever you do, don't order a 
pepperoni pizzadilla ($7.29)! There 
is nothing that challenges the very 
essence of Thanksgiving like pep-
peroni pizza. The Friday's menu 
describes the pepperoni pizzadilla 
as a "Mexican-pizza-like-ltalian-
quesadilla thing." Besides the fact 
that the description is annoying, 
there is nothing about the dish that 

table. This is a double-dose of 
heaven in the form of cheesecake 
and a pecan praline, presented in 
a sweet, buttery graham crust. 

Despite the banter that is a 
central component of my family's 
meals, I would be devastated if I 
ever had to miss seeing my rela-
tives on Thanksgiving. I love my 
relatives dearly and take comfort 
in the predictability of every 
Thanksgiving conversation. 

However, if I had to spend 
Thanksgiving away from my fam-
ily, there is little doubt about where 
I would go. The perfect place to 
spend Thanksgiving (other than 
with my uncle) is obviously TGI 
Friday's. Friday's allows everyone, 
on a daily basis, to awaken their 
inner-glutton, as is necessary for 
any Thanksgiving feast. 

While waiting for the appetizers to settle in your stomach before 
ordering the next course, you will have plenty of time to consider 
what you are thankful for in your life. It is important at this point to 
let your friends know that you appreciate them as much as you have 
appreciated your yummy appetizers. 

Although not a typical Fri-
day's selection, the carrot cake 
($3.99) is surprisingly deliCIOUS. 
The slight taste of pineapple and 
coconut makes this version a little 
different than the standard carrot 
cake, but that classic taste is still 
maintained. I'm sure that at this 
point, you will have all the feel-
ings of a classic Thanksgiving in 
your tummy. 

I think this year I will force my 
roommates to Friday's, before we 
are off to our different destina-
tions over the holiday. I've always 
wondered why we never have 
big Thanksgiving celebrations 
with our friends, in addition to 
celebrating with our families. 

Just as appetizers signal the 
start to a full day of feasting with 
your family, the appetizers at Fri-
day's are only the beginnings to 
much greater things to come. My 
personal favorite, neglected by 
my family on Thanksgiving for 
years, are jalapeno poppers 
(SS.69). Believe me, this dish can 
cure even the worst case of home-
sickness! (Of course, part of that 
might be due to the fact that you 
will be too busy chugging water 
to eliminate the spicy fire from 
your mouth.) 

If you don't find the jalapeno 
poppers to be as tasty your moth-
er's homemade delights, then 
you definitely are not allowed to 

sume as much as possible, and 
those two extra layers are con-
tributing to a greater cause. 

If you feel that the garlic ele-
ment has been lacking in your 
appetizer selections, a superb 
option is the creamy spinach and 
artichoke dip ($5.79). Every time I 
have been to Friday's with a large 
group of people, this is the one 
that goes the fastest (excluding all 
alcoholic drinks for 21st birth-
days). If the strong garlic scent 
makes you uncertain about this 
dish, just remember that .a little 
garlic never hurt anyone. Also 
remember that breath mints 
never hurt anyone either. 

Now that you have consumed 
food from the three most impor-
tant food groups (the jalapeno 
popper food group, the Mexican 
food group and the garlic food 
group), you should be in a festive 

order a turkey burger ($7.49). 
Complete with avocado and red 
onion, the turkey burger is worth 
ordering any day of the year. The 
turkey burger is really nothing 
like homemade turkey, but if you 
chew the French fries fast 
enough, you may be able to trick 
your taste buds into thinking that 
they are mashed potatoes. 
Because of that bizarre phenome-
non, I always opt for cole slaw 
instead of French fries. 

A blackened cajun chicken 
sandwich ($7.79) is even better 
than the turkey burger, although 
it does lack the festive element. 
Served on toasted sourdough 
bread with melted cheddar 
cheese, the blackened cajun chick-
en sandwich is surely as good as 
anything your grandma can cook! 
The way that the chicken is per-
fectly char-grilled will make you 

is redeeming. Even more annoy-
ing, the menu describes this as 
"baked crispy on a stone hearth." 
Come on, this is TGI Friday's! The 
food is supposed to be greasy, not 
baked. 

Now you are faced with the 
true test of how good you are at 
celebrating Thanksgiving. Can 
you eat two desserts? Although 
your cousin may not be there to 
make sure that you eat every bite 
of the cream puffs she slaved 
over, you must consider maxi! 
mum dessert consumption to be 
your personal mission. Team-
work and support are more 
important here than ever before, 
as you have to rally with your 
friends and pump them up for 
the final hurrah. 

You will be glad that you're 
still eating when the praline 
cheesecake ($3.99) arrives at your 

One last hint: If you plan to 
continue your Thanksgiving cele-
bration throughout the night, I 
recommend Margarita Rocks (in 
Pacific Beach on the corner of 
Cass and Hornblend). My uncle 
told me that he recommends the 
new mashed potato margarita ... 
but I would skip that one.

Maybe there is such as thing as bad 
publicity . Gary Coleman, the

Water Polo Takes 
WWPA Tournament 
HAT-tRICK: Three wins send Tritons to NCAAs 
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

Denny Harper, head coach 
for UCSD men's water polo, 
was looking forward to last 
weekend wit h so me trepida-
tion. With his team an over-
whelming favorite to win the 
Western Water Polo Association 
(WWPA ) tournament, he 
wondered if over-confi-
dence might be a 
problem fo r 
the team. 

As it turns 
ou t, the 
Tritons managed to 
control their feelings until 
after the tournament was 
over, winning the WWPA as well 
as a birth in the NCAA Division 
III National Charnrionship Final 
Four, which wit be held at 
Canyonview Pool Dec. 4-5. 

On Friday, the Tritons had 
little trouble defeating 
Cia remont- Mud d-Scri pps 
Colleges by a score of 13-l. 
Goalkeeper Glenn Busch and 
the Tritons didn' t give up a sin-
gle goal until the fourth quarter, 
and were led by Vladimir 
Djapic, who netted four goals. 

In the semifinals of the tour-
nament, the Tritons took on UC 
Davis. 

In a monumental defensive 
effort, UCSD allowed only one 
goal in the first three quarters 
and jumped out to an 11-1 lead 
after three. Davis came back to 

score four goals in the final peri-
od but it was too little too late as 
the Tritons cruised to an 11-5 vic-
tory. 

Djapic again paced the Tritons 
with three goals while Ryan 
Dandy and Ross Mecham each 
netted two. 

In the finals of the tourna-
ment, the Tritons faced their 

archenemy: the Air Force 
Academy. 

The Tritons jumped 
out to a 5-2 
win after 
the firsi 
period and 

the game 
seemed to be securely in 

hand, but the Air Force 
Academy outscored the Tritons 
4-1 in the second period to knot 
the score at six. The scored was 
tied at seven partially through 
the third period before the 
Tritons scored the last three 
goals of the game; one in the 
third period and two in the 
fourth to secure the win. 

Triton star Mecham garnered 
four goals in the affair. 

Mecham was also named 
player of the year for the confer-
ence, while Harper was named 
coach of the year by the voters. 

With the WWPA tournament 
out of the way, Harper and his 
squad can prepare for the NCAA 
Division III National 
Championships. Tickets for the 
affai r are on sale now and can be 
bought at the athletic depart-

in," Alfredson said about the 
semi-final game, as quoted in the 
Union Tribune. "The only reason 
it happened was because we got 
to the ball first. " 

"They were an excellent 
team," UCSD Head Coach Brian 
McManus said about New 
Jersey. "They were much quick-

Loss Ends Women's 
Volleyball Season 
OUT: Top-ranked team eliminates Tritons 
By BRIAN WELLES 
Associate Sports Editor 

Riding high into the postsea-
son, the UCSD women's volley-
ball team appeared to be an 
unstoppable force. 

By crushing Cal Lutheran on 
Nov. 12th and outlasting Cal 
State Hayward on the 13th in 
three games, it looked as though 
the tide of the Tritons 
could not be crushed. 
Eve r y 
aspect of 
UCSD ' s 
game was 
effective and, as a result, 
UCSD hadn't surrendered 
but one game in the playoffs. 

But, like the weather patterns 
over the past few weeks, volley-
ball runs are subject to change -
even those of a volleyball jugger-
naut such as UCSD. 

The Tritons discovered this 
fact in a painful, but nonetheless 
hard-fought, fashion as the 
Division III, No. 1 Central 
College did at home to the No.2 
Tritons what UCSD had been 

• doing to their opponents aU sea-
son long - demolishing them 
(15-4, 15-7, 15-5). Even worse for 
the Tritons was the fact that they 
had to travel all the way to Iowa 
just to lose the competition. 

Despite the desolate image 
that probably comes to mind 
when you thirtk of Iowa, that's 
not what the Tritons were con-
fronted with once they stepped 

onto the court last Saturday 
night in the NCAA Division III 
Quarterfinal game. Facing a 38-0 
team and a crowd of 2,000 loud 
fans - which is the kind of sup-
port that the Tritons aren' t used 
to seeing when playing at 
RIMAC - Central College had 
already scored its most impor-
tant points even before the first 
serve of the match was hit. 

"It was a packed gym 
that was very difficult to 

said. 

play in," 
Head Coach 
Duncan 
McFarland 

The Tritons were on the 
ropes during the game in more 
than one respect. First of all, 
Central College had UCSD dig-
ging its heals into the ground as 
Central's offensive attack forced 
the Tritons to be on the defensive 
for the entire game. UCSD man-
aged 48 dl· ,but its 36 kills were 
not enou to match Central's 
58 and .4 6 hitting percentage. 

"The girls played as hard as 
they could and never gave up," 
McFarland said. "They were just 
too tough for us." 

In addition, Central out-
slugged UCSD when it came to 
finishing off 0rponents to score 
points. Centra had much better 
numbers and percentages, as 
the team committed only 8 hit-
ting errors in just over 100
