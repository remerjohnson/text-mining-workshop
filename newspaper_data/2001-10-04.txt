"Diversity is at the core of our

said. "Last month, we struck a new

Student publication 
should not be a 
forum ·for hate 

III the Sept. 24 issue' of The Koala, there 
.l!>peareu a personal au that singleu out the 
me mbers of a particular ethnic group and 
declared simpl y that nobody liked them. In 
the sam e issue, a satire of the UCSD 
Greek system was printed, naming a made-
up Jewish fraternity called XKA, the mem-
bers of which were calleu "Chikes." The 
Creek letter X, or Chi, is pronounced with 
a haru "k" sound, making the word sound 
like a racial slur. 

ow, freedom of the press is one of the 
Ill os t cherished and fierce ly defended 
tenets of the merican way of life. Being a 
newspaper, the Guardian is very aware of 
the necessity of this right fo r the existence 
of freedom of expression, especia lly at a 
uni,'ersity where you ng minds should be 
opened throug-h exposure to as many view-
points as pOSSible . 

It is exactly for this reason that the 
Gllfmlian ca nnot agree with The Koala's 
decision to run mock advertisements and 
personal ads that use hateful, racist lan-
guage in their snldent-funded publication. 
. -this typt of material only acts to belit-
tle people simply because of their racial 
backgrounds, and serves no purpose at this 
university. In fact, all it does is potentially 
make members of the UCSD community 
feel uncomfortable to study, work and live 
here . 

We feel that thi s kind of message is sti-
tling to the freedom of those who are made 
to feel hated simply because of which eth-
nic group they Identify with, something 
over which they have absolutely no con-
trol. Even worse, it is the money of these 
inuividuals that is bei ng used to fund the 
ex~ression of hatred against them. 

rhe GlIardian is fu lly aware that The 
Kotila is meant to be a humor publication. 
. \Iuch of what makes it so popular is its 
constant irreverence to the current stan-
dards of what is politically correct, and it

Afghanistan rebels could prove to 
be a valuable ally of the U.S. 

Nation needs support from opponents of the 
Taliban, the Northern Alliance, to win war 

By LAWRENCE MARCUS 
Contributing Writer 

Watch the FOX News Channel and 
you will hear pundits like Sen. Zell 
Miller, D-Ga., proclaim that the United 
States needs to homb Afghanistan, civil-
ians be damned. Thankfully, others are 
discussing more responsi blc options. 

However, sending in ground troops 
and carrying out blunt bombing are the 
opti ons most frequently discussed. 
Neither option is sure to bring those 
responsible for the Sept. II attacks to 
justice, but both guar;lI1 tec the U.S. 
involvement in this con flict to thc point 
of no rerurn. This may satisfy many by 
creating the impression that we will not 
stand for any attack on America, hut it 
will do little to ensure that this does not 
occur again . 

The United States needs to act fo r 
the long term, addressing the problem 
in Afghanistan , - the Taliban, - and the 
foreign policy decisions that have aided 
its rise to power. There is a grou p 
already fighting the Taliban, the 

orthern Alliance, ancl if thc Unitccl 
State were to fund it we could avoid 
direct confrontation whde diffusing 
some tension ttl Afghanistan. 

The United States has entcrtaincd 
thi!> idea , but those wielding the most 
tnfluence seem tepid on the proposal. 
Ilowcver, looking at the perils of thc 
other opttons, funding the Northern 
Alliance seem, les!> of an option than 
the only reasonable course of action . 

'10 bomb Afghanistan would be to 
bomb a people that doc!> not support, 
and is in fact being oppressed by those 
re,ponsiblc for the terrorist actions 
being addressed . President Bush has 
said that the United States will make no 
dt!>tincllon between terrorists and those 
harboring them, but one would hope 
that the United States will differentiate 
be(ween terrorists and innocent people. 

Action with ground troops would 
allow more selective attacks than blunt 

bombing, but it carries its own perils. 
On Sarurday, a Senior Iranian cleric 
effectively said that Muslims would not 
sta nd to see any Muslim nation 
attacked . Any direct attack on 
Afghanistan could result in World War 
III: Muslim nations against NATO. 
Even John Ashcroft, an unlikely dis-
senter in the Bush cabinet, has voiced 
concern that retaliation would simply 
open the Unitcd States to more terror-
ism. 

The Ta liban shows no signs of weak-

There is a group already 
fighting the Taliban, the 

Northern Alliance, and if 
the United States were to 

fund it, we could avoid 
direct confrontation whi le 
diffusing some tension in 
Afghanistan ... looking at 

the perils of the other 
options, funding the 

Northern Alliance seems ... 
the only reasonable course 

of action. 

cning in it resolve to harbor the sus-
pects that the United States dcmands, 
so any ac tion in accordancc with inter-
national law seems out of the qucstion . 
The UtlIted States has nevcr followed 
international law, anyway. But that is 
another story. 

So we are left with the orthern 
Alliance. 

The group, which now actually con-
trols 5 pcrcent of Afghanistan, has 
taken new ground even in the weeks 
since the attacks. Russia, India and Iran 
are all considering pledging aid to the 
Northern Alliance. 

Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman of 
California advocates assisting the 
Northern Alliance. . 

"These forces have fought the 
Taliban to a standstill without American 
help," Sherman said. "With our hclp, 
they could march on tlle ruling Afghani 
leaders in Kabul." 

Sherman is a member of the I louse 
International Relations Committee . 

A move to sponsor a foreign military 
would not be unprecedented . The 
United tates has funded and tratned 
the Israeli armed forces since the state 
was formed . Ironica ll y, that action has 
certainly contributed to the prevalence 
of anri -Unitcd States sentiment in the 
Middle East, even though the World 
Trade Center and Pentagon attacks 
were not a direct reaction. 

Aftcr the Taliban came to power in 
1996, militant resistance groups began 
to form. Admittedly, there has hardly 
been a peri od in post-Soviet Afghani 
history where rebel groups, Islamic or 

, otherwise, have not been active. 
But at the current point in time, the 

lines are somewhat clear. The 1 hliban 
has no tmlndate from the people. Civil 
war tS continuous. but with U.S. sup-
POrt, a resolution could be ncar. 

U.S . sanction on ~fghani;,tan have 
done little to help its cause. This only 
hurts the general popul :ttion of 
Afghanistan, already in poverty :lI1d !ous-
ccptible to anti-United Sta tes propa-
ga nda from the 1aliban. 

Pl edgi ng support to the t orthcrn 
Alliance would swing at lensf some 
favorable public opi nion toward the 
United States. 

Of course, the ruling Islamic powers 
in the area would object, but it is 
unlikely that tension would e!>calate to a 
point where It would surely erupt, like 
it would if the United States were to 
launch an attack. The United Sta"tes has 
a unique opportunity to protect ttself 
and set the wheels in motion for a nec-
essary revolution in Afghanistan . 

THUR DAY, OCTOBER 4, ZOOI THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

A valuable lesson in Civics 101 
Eye-opening experiences shed light on crime in capital 

Ii S afc" and "\Nashington, 
D .. " These are terms 
that are not usua lly used 
in the same sentence 

when attcmpting to describe our 
natton 's capital. 

Instead, images of missing 
interns, senal killers, the uncon-
trollable crime and violence ratcs 
are t1nmcdtately conjured. 

\ "hen I anived in Washington on 
Au(( 2) I had Ocen warned by every-
on~ I knew about thc ourragco~lS 
crime ratc there. I wa;. never to walk 
.llon!: or g'() Otlt altcr dark tUlles> I was 
tn J 1.lrgt: grou!>. 

So, I was on guard. But then the 
worst occurred: othing happened. 
I had ' built up this horrible, violem, 
<:rime-ridden image of \Vashington, 
Jnd nothltlg I saw matched up to it. 

'The-!otreets in view of the Capitol 
were clean, bustling with people and 
busttlcsses and bars open at all hours 
of the day and night. The streets 
were under constam patrol by four 

~eparate police departments: thc 
Capttol police. Metro Transit police 
and Metropolitan police along with 
the Secrct Service. 

Life on Capitol Il ill seemed 
perfect: T he immediate world in 
which I walked, ate and shopped 
was compl etely safe. 

I was lulled into a false sense of 
safety and security. This illusion was 
shattcred laSt Friday night when my 
friend wa!> brutally mugged. A man 
IUlllPCcl her from behind. slaltlmed 
her face-first into the concrete side-

walk, grabbed her purse and ran. 
My friend's mugging was a wake 

up ca ll because it occurred in one of 
the purported "safe" areas of 
Washington. 

Ilow it works in Washington is 
that the closer you are to the 
Capitol, the safer you are, suppos-
edly. Starting from the Capitol, 
Washington is broken into four 
quadrants: Northwest, Northeast, 
Southwest and Southea t. 

The entire area of NW is con-
sidered the safest, since some of the 
rinie;.t areas of Dupont ircle, 
Georgetown and Adams Morgan 
all hail from that quadrant. Most of 

E is considered safe, but after hit -
ting 10th Street there is no guaran-
tee This is also the case with the 
other two quadrants, SW and SE. 

The informal rule of thumb I've 
learned ITom \Vashington natives is 
that a person is relatively ;.afe with-
in a 10-block radius in " all four 
quadrants. But that informal rule 
was blown to bits Friday night 
because my friend was mugged in 

E Washington, within a few 
blocks from the Capitol. 

And this past SWlday afternoon, I 
received an even more personal les-
son in Washington Personal Safety 
and Crime 10 I. I had JUSt finished 
cutting across the Capitol and began 
to cross the street when a white blaz-
er suddenly swerved, made an illegal 
U-ntrn and came to a skidding hal t 
by my side. 111en the two men inside 
physica lly tried to get me in the car. 
Bur [ yanked myself away and made 
a mad dash for the otller side of the 
street where a Capitol police officcr 
was standing. 

That thwarted kidnapping 
anempt and my friend's mugging 
made me realize that that crime can 
happen anywhere, and those neat 

tricks we are taught about the crime 
and safety in Washington don't nec-
essarily work in the real world. 

Yet I do believe that there arc 
generally safcr areas in Washington 
than othcr cities. Sadly, the arcas 
that arc considered to be the least 
safe are in the ghettos, where thcre 
is a dramatic disparity of life from 
tllat of life on the I Iill. 

It is not surprising that the 
crime rate is, in some cases, triple 
the amount of crime than what 
occurs in the police districts closest 
ro the Capitol. For example, 
according to Washington's 2000-
200 I crime statistics. in district I, 
which encompasses the Capitol 
area, there were eight homicides in 
June. In sharp contrast, in dtstrict 
4. one of the ghetto areas, there 
were 27 homicides in June. 

As a defense investigator imern, 
nearly every dOl)' when my job takes 
me into what is considered a ghctto 
area of \N'ashingron, thcre are some 
simple safety rules I've becn trained 
to follow. 

First, lock purse, valuables and 
legal documents in your trunk 
before you get to the ghetto. 
Second, never wave a fri endly 
grecting to anyonc in the ghetto, 
for waving is the signal that a per-
son wants to score some drugs. 
These simplc rules have protected 
my investi&'1ltive partner and I thus 
far from becoming victims of vio-
lence. 

Yet, tllC most ironic thing I've 
discovered is that in the areas that 
are the most openly crime-ridden I 
feel perfectly safe, while in the areas 
considered the safest, I do not feel 
nea rly as safe. 

I guess this little idiosyncrasy is 
what makes me love and hate 
Washington at the same time. 

. Breaking barriers allows 
one to open new doors 
While conformity is easy to accomplish, benefits 
await those who step beyond rules and regulations 
By JESSICA UNGEL 
Contributing Writer 

There's no such thing as a true 
nonconformist. Even if one did 
exist, he couldn't last long. Evety 
stoplight would be a disaster. 
Stopping at a red light would be 
conforming to the standards of 
conventional society, so the rule-
bre.lker would be forced to ignore 
the light. Green lights would cause 
multt -car pile-ups a!o well, as the 
nom:onformist would be obliged to 
~top frartle immediately. And that's 
JlI!>t one rntersection, 

I 0, a true nonconformist is 
doomed in today's rule-filled, 
ohligation-crazed society. 
Regardless, there's something to be 
said for going against the norm 
evety now and then. Although non-
conformists may be incompatible 
with the world, nonconformity is 
something altogether different. 

Take being a punk. It's more 
than the mohawks ' and the pierc-
ings, the tattoos and the clothes. It 's 
more than the stereotypes, the 
assumptions, the labe ls. 

Despite popul ar opinion , we 
don't dress or act the way we do out 
of intimidation. We don't listen to 
the lItu!oic becau!>e we want to scare 
people. Because being a punk is 
about more tllan the clothe or the 
music. It's about rebell ion. 

People .Ire always so eager to 
JClept wtthout question . So eager 
to judge, to presume. And pan of 
those assumptions and judgements 
alwn v~ ~eclll s to involve thc auto-

matt~ swallowmg of the superfictal , 
as opposed to taking the time to 

look at people for who they arc. 
The vast majority of kids who 

would be willing to put themselves 
into the punk category aren't trying 
to scare or intimidate. They merely 
want to make a statement, to garner 
a reaction. They want to force the 
understanding that people are more 
than what they look like, and that to 
be accepted, to live the norm. may 
be safe, but its not always best. 

In some ways, it might almost he 
worth it. Fitting in means taking the 
easy way - there's no ostracizing 
from peers or from adults. No star-
ing, no snickering, no insults based 
on appearances alone. Such a 
response can come from almost any 
form of convention breaking: being 
too smart, too srupid, too fat, too 
short, too poor, and certainly, too 
punk. When going against the norm 
can result in almost instant discrim-
ination, longing to conform seems 
understandable, even desirable. 

Of course, there is a price to pay. 
Choosing to follow the beaten path 
means never knowing what might 
have been. It means choosing to 
ignore. one's own individual talents 
and abilities. It means denying the 
3ma7ing &rift of individuality. 

Nonconformity means being 
comfortable with who you are. It 
isn't self-esteem, and it isn't ego-
tism. It's the ability to face a crowd 
of people and not back down. It 
takes strength and srubbornness; it 
takes ttldividualism. 

It takes courage not to need to 
fit in. It takes strength to stand up 
for what you believe in, to test the 
precedent. It's hard to fight agam5t 
a crowd that believes ttl the con-

ventions of society. Yet somehow, 
the tighter the conventions, the 
more people fee l the need to rebel. 

The spirit of punk goes beyond 
whether someone is Straight Edge 
or Sica Oy, whetller they like indie or 
emo. At tlle risk of suffering backlash 
from the punk community itself, I'd 
risk the following: I t's not easy being 
a pWlk. Maybe tl13t'S why we come 
across as defensive and confronta-
tional. Maybe that's why we're so 
eager to fit the constraints of being 
labeled as lost causes and outsiders. 

Granted, there are those who 
wouldn't recogni7.e themselves as 
trying to make some grand, wide-
sweeping statement. But if there's 
one thing that all punks have in 
common, it 's the joy of being dif-
fercnt . Nonconforming is difficult, 
but it can be a lot of fun . 

The decision to conform can 
shape a life. It can quite definitely 
define someone's personality and 
future. 

The choice between being tlle 
same and being different goes 
beyond clothes, cars or cliques. It 's 
more than the superficial signs of 
what people wear or what kind of 
music they listen to or what they 
seem to be. It's the conscious deci-
sion to take the time to look at peo-
ple for wbo they are, not wbot they 
are. It's never easy. 

Breaking the standard rules of 
convention means going again ;.t 
the maJort ty. But In the end , it's the 
difference between bem/:( an indi -
vidual and being jUH like everyone 
c1 .. e. And bcmg an 1tl(livldual --
bemg a punk -- I!> what nonconfor-
mtty is all about.

DURHAM, N.C. - Despite 
Duke University'S prominent 
attempts to recruit and retain 
black faculty members, some who 
have recently left Duke attribute 
their departure in part to racial 
tension. 

Administrators have long said 
that hiring black professors is a 
high priority, but they cite several 
challenges to that goal , including' 
competition with other universi-
ties and the failure of many profes-
sors to gain tenure. Although 
administrators also acknowledge 
problems with racial climate, some 
faculty members say Duke has 
overlooked the difficulties of 
everyday racial discrimination and 
the unique demands made of 
minorities. . 

Monica Green, an associate 
professor of history at Duke, said a 
lack of research support and a poor 
racial climate have convinced her 
to leave Duke, 

"I think most of it is extremely 
subtle and it 's not articulated, It 
adds up and creates a climate 
where o ne feels valued or one 
doesn't feel valued," said Green, 
who is black. '''vVith Duke making 
exceptional claims that it's inter-
ested in minority retention , I and 
others have been shocked at how 

little they have done." 
For the next year, Green is on 

leave researching at the Radcliffe 
Institute for Advanced Study at 
Harvard University. She said she 
will likely resign her Duke posi-
tion soon and move to Arizona 
State University. 

She and other black professors 
emphasized the added work others 
expect of them . More than other 
faculty members, they are expect-
ed to serve on university and 
department committees, mentor 
students and be a face for the insti-
tution, Green said. 

"It's just a fai rly constant 
stream of students - aslcing for 
sympathy, any kind of guidance, a 
friendly face. a shoulder to cry on 
- students who, like us, feel their 
academic potential is not being 
supported or given guidance," she 
said. 

William Hart, a former assis -
tant professor of religion, echoed 
that sentiment. He came to Duke 
in 1994 and gained tenure thi s 
spring, Just weeks later, however, 
he resigned his position and 
accepted a post at the University 
of ortll Carolina at G reensboro,

Students asked to 
wear IDs on campus 
Students not pleased with what they see 
as more than just an inconvenience 

P[ IILADELPHIA The 
photo isn't toO Ilanering, Digging 
In hal'kp<lcks and earching in wal -
lets IS a nUisance. And don 't even 
mention the Ii nes that form to 
swipe the pieces of plastic, 

Until a few days ago, that was 
the extent of the PennCard blues. 

But now the PennCard con-
cerns have climaxed after 
University of Pennsylvania stl.l -
delll, hCJrd Jbuu t a Dl vlslun u l 
Public Safety policy that, if 
approved, will ask the university'S 
community to voluntarily wear 
thei r IDs all day, every day to enter 
academic buildings. 

" It's a terrible idea," said sopho-
more Monica Ea. "Obviously it 
"'II",, 1'<I",".d 11'<·<,.111111 . It ·, like 
pUllllIg .1 ,en.d llullI!>er un every-
unc." 

Unl'Vcrsi ty policy nuw requires 
Penn IDs to be worn from 10 p.m, 
tmtil 7 a,m, in campus buildi ngs. 
The proposed policy would be in 
effect 24 hours a day. 

1any students said that they did 
not know much about thc proposed 
policy. 

The policy is now being exam-
ined by a university committce, 
though offi cials have not sa id which 
committee is evaluating the pro-
posal. 

S tudents have reacted with 
anger, disgust and mockety, ca lling 
the policy an unnecessary measure 
.11 1.1 .1 huge 11l1l1ll\ ellICIlLe. 

" It's just a pain ," said sopho-
more Elizabeth Esrov, "It's another 
thing to remember." 

The policy is intended to curb 
on-campus theft, Vice President for 
Public Safety Maureen Rush said at 
an Undergraduate Assembly meet-
Ill !! ~ll'l HI 

Ru, h ddliled un -~JlI1pu, theft 
as the stea ling of personal property 
such as laptops and Palm handheld 
devices, but declined to comment 

on details of the proposa l. 
Students, however, are aslci ng 

for evidence to suppo rt that these 
thefts are being perpetrated by 
those without Penn Cards. 

"Is there proof that this on-cam-
pus theft is not coming from mem-
bers of the Penn community?" 
asked sophomore Samantha Simon. 

Rush sa id statistics show that 
most crimes on campus are com-
IIlIlled by nun -Penn cUll1mul1lty 
members, but did not provide the e 
statistics at the meeting - one of 
several reasons the UA decided to 
postpone talcing an official stance. 

She also repeatedly denied that 
the proposal is in response to the 
Sept. II terrorist a ttacks on ew 
Yerrk ,111.1 \,\ ·",hlllgWI1. 

But lI1any wmmllnll)' I11cmber~ 
instinctively based their opinions 
on the assumption that the policy is 
a direct effect of terrorist t1lreat. 

Elizabeth Fitzgerald, a resident 
at the Children's Hospital of 
Pennsylvania, said the ID policy 
would not make her feel any safer. 

Her reason? The proposal 
would be useless in deterring a ter-

Prof. threatened after 
unpatriotic remarks 
History professor to stay hOlne 
until safety can be assured 

ALBUQUERQUE - The 
University of ew Mexico and 
his lory professor Richard 
Berthold have agreed that he will 
stay home until next week while 
personal sa fety matters are investi-
ga ted, Provost Brian Foster 
announced Oct. 2. 

"This is being done as a pre-
cauti onary measure because of our 
concern about professor 
Berthold's safety," said Foster, who 
authorized the university'S action. 

Berthold recendy commented 
to his class Sept. II that "anyone 
who blows up the Pentagon has 
my vote." lie subsequen tl y apolo-
gized for his remarks. Since theil, 
severa l New Mexico legislatOrs 
have ca lled for his tertlllnation .

about currcntly enrolled students. 

"The requcst is not targeting 
anyone who is in our conununity," 
Acciardo said. 

T he lmiversity will comply with 
the subpoena and can release the 
records without srudent consent. 

T he U.S. Department of 
Education has informed college 
offi lals that they can release this 
information under the 1974 Family 
Education Rights and Privacy Act.

tenure case, Hart said he felt mar-
ginalized by three factors: being a 
junior faculty member, working in 
a fie ld of religion our of the mai n-
stream and being a minority. 

'" can't say that' ever encoun-
tered any sort of explicit or outra-
geous mrts of behaviors or com-
mcnts by colleagues," Hart ,aid . 
"On the other hand ... it 's rare 
that you encounter people who 
eva luate your work in a serious 
way." 

ot all black professors have 
left Duke shari ng Hart's senti-
ment. Many ci te failed bids for 
tenure, offers from other institu-
tions and a si mple desire for 
change. 

Pamela Jackson, former ass is · 
tant professor of sociology, prai sed 
Duke for its diverse student body, 
resea rch resources, supportive 
ad ministrati on and "very comfort-
able, very welcoming" atmos-
phere. She was denied tenure last 
year, and is now at Ind iana 
University at Bloomington. 

"Duke has a very good pro-
gram, 1 think, in terms of recruit-
ing minority faculty, espeCially 
junior faculty. BlIt they're at least 
experiencing a siruation similar to 
other universities - what's often 
ca ll1'd the 'revolving-cloor ,yn-
Jrolllt! ,'" , he S.IIU . 

Duke ha historically voiced a 
commitment to hiring and retain-
ing black professors. In 1988, 
administrators created the Black 
Faculty Initiative, which called on 
each hiring unit to recruit at least 
one black faculty member and the 
university to double its black fac-
ulty by 1993 .

Acciardo also said it is important 
for people to understand URI is nut

pocnas for records. She noted that 
such colleges as Auburn Univcrmy 
in Al:tbama, Salt Lake Community 
College in Utah, the Univermy or 
California and California St 'lte 
University have also received sub-
poenas. 

"URl is no different than :lny 
other college or lmiversity being 
asked for information," AcciJrdo 
said.

But Duke did not meet that 
goal and in 1993 set a new one of 
doubling the number of black fac-
ulty universirywide within the next 
decade. As of this spring, Duke 
had raised the number of regular-
rank black professors from 44 to 
79. 

Provost Peter Lange reiterated 
the administration's commitment 
to faculty diversity, but he 
acknowledged that raCial clIII13te 
can be an obstacle to retent ion. 

"T he f3culty is a pretty dil'erse 
group of people with dil'erse atti-
tudes to life," Lange s3ld . 
"Inevitably, you'll find unfortu-
nate attitudes, as you do ill the 
general population, although here 
they may be more intellectual-
ized." 

Together with senior academic 
deans and department chairS, 
Lange uses resources to try to 
reta in faculty members who 
receive offe rs from other universi-
ti es. He said he plans to increase 
the use of exit surveys for depart -
ing scholars to ge t 3 clearer picture 
of their complaints. Maintaining a 
welcoming racial climate, howev-
er, poses a different type of ch31-
lenge, he said. 

"A welcoming place means pre -
eminently to support their work 
and to ensure that they have a 
community of scholars they ca n 
interact with easily and th3t will 
support them ," Lange said. "TII ,1t 
is an important level th3t the 
,enior admll1lstratlon can play .1 
role in, but ultimatel v th 'lt 
depends Oil wh.1t they lim!' on the 
ground, ei ther in their depart -
ments or in other units." 

Lange and several other scnlor-
le\el administrators, includlllg 
President an Keohane, pcrson31-
Iy attempted to persuade Ilart to 
stay.

By all accounts, Alien Ant Farm has had one hell of a year. Their major label debut, "ANThology," was 
released March 6 by 

DreamWorkslNew Noize. That 
album has since gone platinum and 
is continuing to climb Billboard's 
Top 200 charts. 

Their single, ' "Smooth 
Criminal," has held the No. I spot 
on Billt>oard's Modern Rock 
Charrs, and the Marc Klasfeld-
directed video has gained heavy 
rotation on MTV and VHI. They 
played England's legendary 
Reading Festival, performed at the 
2001 MTV Video Music Awards 
and are now embarking on their 

own headlining tour. 
Not bad 'for a band that formed 

JUSt five years ago in Riverside, 
California. 

In 1996, vocalist Dryden 
Mitchel1, guitarist Terry Corso, 
bassist Tye Zamora and drummer 
Mike Cosgrove were all bumming 
around the local Riverside rock 
scene, playing in various bands, 
when they eventually decided to 
play together. 

"Individual1y, we were trying to 
figure out who were the best play-
ers in the area," recalls lead singer 
and lyricist Mitchell. "We kind of 
identified with each other and 
started cheating on the bands we 
were playing with at the time, get-
ting together after practices. We 
played our first show in 1996 ... 
and have been together ever since."

As one of the most multital-ented men in the music industry, Warren G has 
·done everything there is to 

do in rap music. Whether it's sell-
ing millions of his own records or 
producing platinwn hits for other 
artists, the G-child has had a huge 
impact on West Coast rap as we 
know it, 

As a teenagt;r growing up in 
Long Beach, Calif., Warren was 
constantly surrounded by music. 
His parents heavily influenced him 
with their extensive jazz, soul and 
funk collections. This early expo-

What's an A.S. Council-sponsored Festival with-out some drama? It seems that Toya wasn't happy 
with her agreement, so she backed 
out of FallFest. Perhaps she was 
tOO good for UCSD. 

Well, we didn't need her any-
way. We got Afroman. 

Yes, that's right, and hopefully 
by the time the festival comes 
around, Afroman won't back out 
'cause he got high. 

Afroman Ooseph Foreman) 
tarted as a guitar player in Los 

Angeles and played sidewalks, par-
ties and rap contests. He penned his 
first tune back in junior high when 
he wrote a song based on the size of 

suit of a career in the music indus-
try. He teamed up with his friend 
Nate Dogg and his fellow Long 
Beach Crip Snoop Dogg to form 
the group 2 13, named after the Los 
Angeles area code. 

The group practiced in the back 
room of the local VIP record store 
and eventually Warren produced 
Snoop's demo, "Super Duper 
Snooper." Warren took the demo 
to his half-brother to listen to and 
to get his opinion. 

Most people would be more 
than happy to listen to something 
made by their younger brother, but 
Warren's sibling happened to be 
former NWA icon Dr. Ore. Dre 
always said he was too busy to lis-
ten to it. Warren knew he had a 
good product, bur he needed to 

his teacher's breasts. Or shall we say, 
lack thereof. He was expelled. 

In November 1999 he indepen-
dently released his album "Sell Your 
Dope." He now has a new album 
out on Universal Records called 
"'Ibe Good TlIJles," which includes 
the hit "Because I Got High." His 
album sold 100,000 units within the 
first week, pushing it to the top 15 
on the Billboard Chart. 

"Because I Got High" is the 
most recognizable song and it first 
appeared on the "jay and Silent Bob 
Strike Back" soundtrack. It quickly 
reached No. 1 in major markets 
around the country, including Los 
Angeles, New York, Boston, 
Philadelphia and San Francisco. 

If you haven't heard the song, 
it's basically about Afroman not 
being able to do anything because

However, it was guitarist Corso 
who came up with the band's 
unusual name. 

"I was daydreaming at my dull 
desk job with my feet up and ] 
thought to myself, 'Wouldn't it be 
cool if the human species were 
placed on earth and cultivated by 
alien intelligence? Maybe the aliens 
added us to an aonosphere that was 
$.uitable for us and they've been 
watching us develop and colonize, 
kind of like what a kid does with an 
ant farm, where the aliens are the 
kids and humans are the ants.'" 

It wasn't long before Alien Ant 
Farm was gigging steadily 
throughout the western United 
States and Europe, playing to huge 
festival audiences. Their boldly

find a way to get Ore to hcar it. 
At a party one night, Warren 

slipped the demo tape into the 
stereo; Ore loved it and asked who 
it was. Warren told him that it was 
his group. Ore invited them to the 
studio, and ended up collaborating 
with Snoop, Nate and Warren on 
one of the most famous rap albums 
ever, "The Chronic." 

The success of "The Chronic" 
gave Warren some well-deserved 
notoriety, ultimately allowing him 
to develop his talents on his own, 
outside Ore's shadow. 

He caught a brealc when his 
vocal collaboration with Mr. 
Grimm, called "Indo Smoke," 
which appeared on the "Poetic

he got high. It's hilarious. 
And although he threatens to 

become just another one-hit won-
der, Afrornan had to pay his dues 
before he scored a hit single. He 
became disillusioned with the Los 
Angeles scene and moved all the 
way to Hattiesburg, Miss., where 
he gigged and refined his sound. 

He is now backed up by a drum-
mer, a hass player and a Iceyboardisr. 
Afroman handles the vocals and the 
rhymes, in addition to wielding a 
double-necked guitar on stage. 

His hard work paid off and now 
he's getting massive recognition at 
parties and on local radio stations. 

So grab some doobies, catch 
Afroman at FallFest for free this 
Friday and grab tickets for his show 
on October 6, 2001 at the San 
Diego Sports Arena.

'Contact' uniquely ligbts up the 
stage with passion and flair 
Three small dance acts express the passion, illusion 
and hopes of various characters 
By CHARLIE TRAN 
Hiatus Editor 

W e often rely on our vocal capabilities to express our fears, feelings and emo-tions. In the musical "Contact," how-
ever, verbal communica tion takes a backseat 
while the ani tic form of dance conveys the 
performers' thoughts and desires. The self-
labeled "new kind of musical" offers a fresh 
lUnd of theater through innovative choreog-
raphy and sexy themes. 

Theater 
REVIEW 

In this musical, despair, illusion and 
renewal are all played out through the com-
mon language of dance in three separate, 
short stories. AJthough all three acts differ 
in style, music and choreography, they 
match in resonance to suit each other the-
matically. 

AJmost everything, from the dance styles 
to the soundtrack (yes, I did say sound-
track), is unique in "Contact." There is an 
eclectic mix of both music and dance that 
brings a welcome change to the usual musi-
cal. 

Don't expect an original score because all 
the music is pre-recorded, but what a wide 
and interesting range of music it is. T he 
score is perfectly timed with creative and 
addictive dance steps, resulting in a simple 
yet effective tone and look. From 
Tchaikovsky to Dea n Martin to Robert 
Palmer, the music complements the great 
choreography of Susan Stroman ("The 
Music Man," "Crazy For You.") 

The first act, "Swinging," is set in 1767 
and deals with love betwl!en an aristocrat, 
his lady and a ervant. Only three actors 
dance the entire time and the set itself is 
minimal. With its simplicity, the first act 
establishes the tone of "Contact." No words 
are spoken and only one song is pl ayed, 
leavi ng the audience free to focus on the 
light, airy grace of the dancing. The mood 
is light, but also racy and full of sexual innu-
endo. In terms of story, "Swinging" is too 
full of fluff, leaving the viewer wanting 
more. 

"Did You Move?" is the title of the sec-
ond set, which takes place in a '50s restau-
rant in Queens. This act depicts the life of 
a lonely woman (Meg Howrey) who 
endures an ill -tempered, abusive husband. 
Once again, dia lob'1le is minimal because 
the housewife expresses her comed ic 
desires through dance alone, allowing 
everyone to become a part of the her 
romantic and comedic fantasies. The 
housewife's airy yet fragi le hopes can be 
seen as her sophomoric, naive leaps and 
jumps manifest her desire for a new life. 

T he las! portion of the play is also thl.

best and most emotional. In this modern-
day act, a suicida l advertising agent named 
Michael Wiley (AJan Campbell) is at a 
crossroad in his empty life. Wandering 
through Manhattan , he drifts into a night 
club where he meets a lady of intrigue and 
mystery: the woman in the yellow dress 
(Holly Cruikshank.) A metaphor for the 
quality of the entire production, the yellow 
dress is sexy and full of life. 

What defines the last act is the brilliance 
and radiance of the enigmatic woman, who 
eleva tes the enti re cast's performance.. 
Cruikshank's dramatic performance is full 
of an energy, and her devi lish charm is 
embodied in her infamous and mesmeriz-
ing yellow dress. 

The third act provides the most "meat" 
in plot and subst~ nce, dealing with such dark 
subjects as depression and suicide, which are 
in turn counteracted with hope, renewal and 
love. As Wiley tries to win the affection of 
the woman in the yellow dress, swing dances 
exemplify what "Contact" is all about: pas-
sion. 

Even for those not familiar with theater 
or dance, "Contact" is a simplistic yet mov-
ing series of performances that should not 
be missed. In essence, "Contact" is more 
than great dancing: It is the expression of 
love and hope.

Alien Ant Farm 
ANThology 
Dreamworks 

*** 
Is Alien Ant Farm des-

tined to ascend the throne 
of rock royalty once held by 
bands like Led Zeppelin, 
U2 and Radiohead? 

No. But with that said, 
theIr sophomore release, 
"ANTthology," recorded 
In orth Ilollywood and 
produced by J ay 
B.lunlgardner (Papa 
i{o,lch, Slipknot, oal 
Chamber), is not half bad. 
It ', a good rock record. 
( ;(Jod, but not great. 

II' you're looking (or 
I.lgged, four-minute fixes of 
typlc,ll dlemcs like rclation-
,hlp~ and famasies, you will 
certainly lind thelll on 
"ANThology." 

Inger and - lyricist 
Dryden Mitchell admi ts 
that "many of thc songs 
were written during a 
breakup. \Vriting them was 
be ncr than me chasing 
,,)meone around who did-
n't wam to be chased." 

Il owever, some songs, 
likc "Courage," with the 
lyrics, "Contrary to the 
matter/ \ Vho you are, you 

are notl Come with me, I'll 
show you Saturn/ Planets 
don't quite align," makes 
me dllnk he ~hou ld have 
J u,t ch.lsed her anyway. 

\\ hi Ie the lyrics may be 
folr fJ'(Jm pOIgnant, there is 
somethi ng about 

"ANTholo~(y" that makes 
it bettcr than your average 
rock record. "j\10vies," 
which compares a bad rela-
tionship to a movie, stands 
out as an especia lly good 
track. 

"Flesh and Bone" is 
another track that moves 
particularly well. The rea-
son these songs work is 
that they go back to the 
tried-and-true formula of 
sparse verses broken up by 
heavy melodic choruses 
that make you want to 
throw your hands in the air 
and bang your head. 

Of course, the one track 
that can't be ignored on 
"ANThology" is the rock 
remix of "Smooth 
Cri minal" because stylisti-
ca ll y, it sticks out like a 
sore thumb. 

Among a collection of 
songs that are straight-
faced, this tongue-in-cheek 
cover just throws a slice of 
cheese ontO the tail end of 
the album and disrupts its 
overa ll appeal. 

Those who buy 
Thology" because of 

the popularity of "Smooth 
Crimi nal" will not be dis-
appointed. However, the 
throw-back to the 1980s 
seems like a blemish on an 
album where all the other 
songs belong together. But 
that's knit-picking. 
"ANThology" rea lly is 
good. 

- Lindsay Boyd 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

album 

Dredg 
Leitmotif 

Independent 

**** 
With a few good listens 

to "Leitmotif," I have 
slowly begun to realize 
that this is one of the most 
ullusual rock aibullls I have 
heard in a very long time. 

Dredg has created a rock 
symphony. If I had to force 
them into a genre, it would 
be progressive rock. But this 
is progressive rock without 
the cOlmorations that tide 
implies these days - an 
over-produced and hard to 
follow New Age-like album. 

"LeitmotiP' is a concept 
album that spans five 
movements. Unique guitar 
riffs noodle around incred-
ible drumming. Even 
though the voca ls tend to 
be weak, rhe musical 
approach of Dredg more 
than makes up fo r it. 

Dredg breaks away from 
the traditional verse-cho-
rus-verse-chorus pattern 
with a cOllStantly evolving 
sound as hard electric gui-
tars sweep in and out with 
acoustic bruitars. The drums 
and the gJlitars work in har-
mony as they drive the 

. 

reviews 
album to its end. 

The development of dif-
ferent themes creates bril-
liant songs that melt into 
each other, and be(ol'e you 
know it, you're at track five. 

The songs are also cryp-
ti c, with titles like 
"Traversing Through the 
Arctic Cold, We Search for 
the Spirit of Yuta," 
"PengJlins in the Desert" 
and "90 Hour Sleep." lltere 
is definitely a sense of mysti-
cism behind the songs. 

The odd atmospherics 
and the electronic noises 
found throughout the 
album are reminiscent of 
Radiohead and some 
Queens of the Stone Age. 
In the liner notes, Dredg 
proudly states that "All 
instruments and sounds are 
real, no samples." 

With their music, 
Dredg.sends you on an epic 
journey. Dredg includes an 
actual story in their sleeve 
notes, and their tale begins 
m San Francisco before 
they head toward the Arctic 
to the mythical underwater 
city o( Natoma. 

Throughout the album, 
they make their way to 
Northern Asia and Mount 
Everest in their quest for 
trUtil. Ultimately, they find 
themselves and discover 
how each piece of culture 
fits into the puzzle of life. 
This realization comes after 
their "90 Hour Sleep." 

This is an album that 
you have to play from track 
one to the vcry end or you 
will lose the entire artisti c 
concept of it. 

You must listen to all of 
"LeionotiP' to see the entire 
journey unfold before you.

Remy Zero 
The Golden Hum 

Elektra 

*** 
The story of Remy 

Zero does not start In 
1988, when Shelby Tate 
and his brothel' Cinjun 
Tate along with Cedric 
LeMoyne, J effrey Cain 
and Greg Slay started a 
band. In fact, the Remy 
Zero story starts about 50 
years ago, with a fellow 
named Remy Boligee. 

By 1969, Boligee and 
friend Sam Bruno com-
mitted over 30 hours of 
tape with music, conver-
sa tion, ramblings and 
long periods of si lcnce. 
Bruno lost track of 
Boligee and gave the tapes 
to a 12-yea r-old , Shelby 
Tate, whose parents were 
good fri ends with the 
Brunos. 

That's where the Remy 
Zero story begins. The 
band, as we know now, 
recreated, rearranged and 
reinterpreted the works of 
Boligee. They even 
recorded sections of the 
tape into their recordings. 

They released their 
self-titled debut album in 

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4, 200 I 

1996 and released "Villa 
Elaine" in 1998. ow, 
nearly three years later, 
they have re leased 
"Golden Hum." 

Even though the band 
is from Alabama, their 
sound seems to be disti nc-
tively British. One could 
even compare them to 
early lhvis with more of 
an edge and crunch to 
their guitars. They have 
also tOured extensively 
with Travis, which may 
account for the Travi 
influence in their" olden 
Hum" album. 

Remy Zero's use of 
sweeping strings on 
"OutlIn" give the song a 
more anthem-esque quali-
ty. Comparisons to a less-
produced U2 album 
wouldn't be too far off. 

The haunting wail of 
Cinjun Tate in "Save Me" 
could be mistaken for the 
wail of Fran Healy from 
Travis or Thom Yorke 
from Radiohead. 

The driving pulse of 
"Belong" is a wonderfully 
polished pop song with a 
steady pulse that gets 
you r head nodd in g in no 
time. 

My personal favorite is 
"Over The Rai ls & 
Ii o ll ywood High, " with 
its Weezer voca l influ-
ences and thick guitar 
crunches during the cho-
rus. 

Most may not know 
about Remy Zero, but the 
opportunity to check them 
out is at hand. They will be 
playing in support of 
Travis on Oct. 21 at 
Spreckles Theatre. Tickets 
are on sa le now.

Simon and Felix Jaxx it up 
Basement Jaxx take on 4th & B with a heavy helping of house 
By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

I met BasementJaxx. Will this taint the objectivi-ty of my concert review? Of 
course it will . 

Simon Ratcliffe and Felix Buxton 
of Basement Jaxx have released twO 
hit albums with a slew of singles 
from each one. "Remedy" in 1999 
produced suth hits and fuvorites as 
"Rendezvous," "Bingo-Bango" and 
"Red Alert." Their most recent 
effort, "Rooty," has yielded such 
musical wonders as "Romeo" and 

. "Where's Your Head At?" 
They have remixed the Pet Shop 

Boys and Roger Sanchez. They were 
courted by major labels before sign-
ing to independent tabel, XL. 

And they have to be the nicest 
chaps in music. 

After attending their incredible 
performance at 4th & B on 
Monday. I waited outside with my 
buddies in hopes of catching the 
Jaxx wandering out backstage. I 
expected them to stumble out with 
a girJ on each arm and expensive 
ciga rettes hanging out of their 
mouths. Of course, these world 
famous house producers would be 
at the lap of luxury, right' Wrong. 

Fdlx stumbled out, not widl a 
borrle of Skyy vodka in his hand but 
a huge bag of equipment. He carried

sonal relationship that started when

his own stuff! Even after I confused 
Felix's name with his cohort's, he 
lcindly signed autographs and con-
tinued to help put equipment into a 
nearby truck. 1 slipped him a busi-
ness card with.my e-mail address.my 
way of saying, "e-mail me!" After all, 
it was Felix from BasementJaxx. 

I searched for Simon around 
their tour bus but couldn't find 
him. I aslced my newfound friend 
(Felix, of course) where Simon was 
and he poked his head into the bus 
and called for Simon. Simon, also 
carrying his own Ings and equally 
pleasant, stepped out of the bus and 
faithfully signed autographs for the 
few people who stuck around to bid 
the Jaxx adieu. 

I was like a 12-year-old on the 
morning of your gift-receiving win-
ter holiday of choice. 

BasementJaxx's show was simply 
amazing. Their OJ set was comple-
mented by live singers, dancers and 
live percussion as wcll . At one 
point, Simon stepped out from 
behind dle decks to play the guitar 
and Felix supplied the vocals for a 
rousi ng rendition of "\"'here's Your 
I lead At?" with Groove Armada ("1 

both bands were slaves to the 
California club circuit just years 
before. 

When Papa Roach gained pop-
ularity, they did not leave their old 
friends behind. 

Corso explains, "We always said 
whoever takes off first would help 
the other group up, and that's the 
way it happened. They've been 
very vocal about us, which is price-
less, and we can't thank them 
enough.ft 

Now it is Alien Ant Fann's turn 
to reach out to bands such as Dredg 
and label-mate Pressure 4-5, who 

See You Blaby") and BT ("Never 
Gonna Come Baclc Down"). 
Known to play rousing sets with live 
guitars and percussion in addition 
to their turntables, synths and com-
puters, one wonders if this will be 
the way many electronica producers 
will start to showcase their music. 

The massive video screen spit out 
Vegas-like colors as theJaxx rocked a 
relatively small but incredibly enthu-
siastic crowd who bounced and 
sweated to every single song. 

The Jaxx dropped in crowd 
favorites like "Red Alert," "Bingo 
Bango" and "Romeo." The beats 
were hard and loud and the attitude 
was funlcy and sexy in a way that was 
distinctively Basement Jaxx. The 
pace was unforgiving as they pound-
ed through each song with different 
dancers and vocalists, leaving the 
audience screaming and breathless 
by the time their set finished up at a 
criminally early II p.m. 

Did I mention that I met 
Basement J axx? 

And they were the nicest guys. As 
Illy friend said with her high-
pitched-cartoonish-voice, "they're 
so cutel I just want to take them 
home ,vith me."

will join them as they kick off their 
headlining tour this October. 

Onstage, Alien Ant Farm tries 
to keep tllings light and fun . 

"Music does good things to peo-
ple - it's one of those art forms 
everyone enjoys," explains 
Mitchell. "It's magical when we 
play our stuff for the fans and they 
light up. We take our music very 
seriously, but we're also a very 
tongue-in-cheek group. We want 
to keep that enjoyment going."

Steve Zahn 
gets behind 
the wheel in 
'Joyride' 
Lackluster teen 
thriller drives 
nowhere, lacks good 
acting 
By DAVID BYNUM 
Contributing Writer 

TWo estranged b~others driving cross-country in a 1971 Chrysler Newport making 
prank calls on a CB radio sounds 
like a surefire comedy hit, doesn't 
it? The recipe to turn this comedy 
into a teenage thriller calls for one 
psychotic truck driver and one hot 
college girl. 

Playing the two estranged 
brothers are Paul Walke r (who 
most of you will remember as the 

Film 
REVIEW 

injured all-state quarterback from 
"Varsity Blues") and the ever-hilar-
ious Steve Zahn ("Saving 

ilverman, " "That Thi ng Yuu 
Du"). The majority of the film is 
interplay betwee n Walker and 
Zahn. This creates a bit of a prob-
lem, because Walker is about a yea r 
of intensive acting lessons away 
from being able to stumble through 
a film without annoying whatever 
part of the audience that isn't over· 
come by his dimples. Until those 
lessons are paid for, he's stuck with 
competing against Freddie Prinre 
Jr. for all of the worthless young-
male-actor roles in Hollywood. 

Leelee Sobie~ki plays the lead 
female character, Venna . She 
describes Venna as "the girl with 
the boobs and the butt who iUJts go 
to college." 

Unfortwlately, Venna is that and 
nothing more. The young actress 
does the best she can, considering 
her character's onJy purpose is to 
keep the audience from getting tired 
of Zahn's attempts to get Walker 
into trouble with trite and over-used 
exclamations such as "Come on, 
man l " and "Dude, this is awesome." 

Zahn's comic styling is thi s 
film 's only saving grace. He plays 
the typical , comiccre1ief smartass, 
but Zahn makes the character all 
his with his trademark facial and 
vocal expressions. His hijinks are 
refreshing and at the same time 
oddly misplaced in this teen 
thriller. 

Zahn has fewer and fewer 
opportunities to let his comic 
genius shine as the movie goes on 
because this film only gets more 
and more intense. The fact that the 
film's single greatest attribute gets 
weaned out over time leaves the 
audience to watch nothing more 
than blood fly allover the screen. 

Since this thriller has so few 
redeeming qualities and is rated R, 
1 imagine you are wondering at this 
point about the nudity factor. 
Leelee Sobieski fans (if such a thing 
exists) will be disappointed to know 
that there is no female nudity any-
where in this film. Partial male 
nudity occurs at one point, but the 
R rating comes mostly as a result of 
violence. Unfortunately, this 
joyride is for Steve Zahn fans o nly.

rcview~ . The album had some qual-
ity traeles, including "'Smokin' Me 
Out," which featured Ronald Isley. 
Unfortunately, Warren suffered 
from the same dilemma many 
artists do after a huge first album: 
unrealistic expectations. 

Two years later, he released his 
third album, titled " I Want It All." 
The album featured many artists, 
including Snoop, are, Daz, 
KlIrupt and Mack 10, and received 
more favorable reviews. 

\Vhilc Warren G the artist has 
sold millions of records, his great-
est impact on rap music has been 
through his production work. lie's 
earned production credits for 
artists such as MC Breed, Jermainc

Kurupt. He's also produced for 
arguably the most talented rapper 
of all time: 2 Pac. 

[-lis feel for the studio and exper-
tise on the mixi ng board are 
unmatched in rap music today. OK, 
maybe one other producer can 
match his skills: Dr. Ore. But if you 
have to come in second place to any-
one, why not your older brother?

Stoner: 
Bonds deseNes some 
credit for his output 
Continued from pale 24 
warfare being run hourly on televi -
sion stations. 

If Bonds sets a record, it will 
also be evidence of the evolution of 
athletes. When McGwire hit 70 in 
t998 and no one else came dose to 
matching that in the following two 
years, it raised the question of 
whether it was a fluke. 

But Bonds' 69 homers, along 
with Sammy Sosa's three recent 60-
home run seasons, proves that ath-
letes are pushing the limits and 
raising the standards of excellence. 

Also, Bonds hasn 't had the con-
• rroversy McGwire had over "nutri -

tional supplements." There are still 
people who believe that MeG wire's 
name should have an asterisk by it 
because of that, which is absurd. 

I f Bonds gets the record, he will 
prove that it can be done without 
any type of enhancer. While I don't 
think supplements helped 
McGwire hit 70 home runs, I sti ll 
think. athletes should rely solely 
upon themselves for building and 
retaining muscle. I mean, I use pro-
tein powder after I work out, but I 
doubt I would ever use products 
like creatine that still haven't been 
thoroughly tested for side effects. 

There are also a few reasons 
Bonds shouldn't get the record. My 
wnCl!rn IS that baseball's most illus-
triOUS record will have been broken 
twice in the last five years. What if 
somcone breaks it next year' Or 
what If it gets broken every year? 
This excitement - this fervor and 
passion that exists now - will die 
off as people tire of the record 
bcing broken again and again . 

The way things are going, he 
might not even get a chance . 
Bonds is getting walked more and 
marc, which irritates me. Bonds 
was walked 1\\ Ice and hit by a pitch 
Tuesday in a huge display of cow-
ardicc by I louston pitchers. Sunday 
against the Padres, Bonds only got 
one strike in tl pitches after he hit 
his 68th home run the day before. 

At least give him the chance to 
break the record. This is torture. 
It's like giving someone an exten-
sive tOur of heaven and then slam-
ming the gates and sending them 
straight down to hell. 

\Vhether Bonds walks, or hits 
hiS way 111\0 the record books, will 
be decided by the Astros and 
Dodgers. Would they rather be 
rcmembered as the guys who gave 
up a homc run to one of the great-
est home run hitters of all time, or 
as the guys who were too scared to 
let hi111 try?

Team looks to future 
matches for success 
Continued from pale 23 
Oct. IJ . lbe Tritons will officially 
begin their year with the UCSD 
Triton Invitational on Oct. 27. 

Both squads will be tested early 
in their schedules. The Tritons will 
take on the University of the 
Pacific on Nov. 9 in Stockton, 
Calif., and compete against UC 
Davis on Nov. 10. UC Davis fin-
ished fourth at last year's NCM 
C hampionships. 

Nov. 17, the Tritons will take on 
Cal State University Bakersfield. A 
victory there will be especially 
motivating because Bakersfield's 
men's team has won two consecu-
tive NCAA Championships. 

The Triton swim teams are excit-
ed about their chances and the 
young talent this year on their team. 
Both squads feel they have a chance 
to improve on last year's finishes. 

UCSD's success wiU depend on 
teamwork, according to McGihon. 

"The freshmen look up to the 
upperclassmen," McGihon said. 
"The older swimmers will need to 
lead by example."

Men's soccer wins again

One win can be considered a 
fluke. ' I\vo can even be chalked up 
to luck. But afte r the UCSO men 's 
soccer team racked up its thir I 
straight win on Sunday afternoon, 
you have to admit it: These guys 
have game. 

The TritOns shut out their 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association rival, the Cluco State 
Pioneers, 2-0 at Triton Soccer 
Stadium. The win brings UCSD 
to within one game of the .500 
mark with a record of 4-5 in the 
CCM and 4-7 overall. 

Despite being outshot in the 
match 17-8, the lritons relied on 
defense to carry thell1lO the victory.

Watanabe, the holder of 10 
UCSD swimming records, com-

Semor defender Jamie Lutton 
came through at the 19:53 mark 
with his first goal of the season, 
giving UCSD the early lead. 
Lutton converted a penalty kick 
after Pioneer goalkeeper Dustin 
Easnnent fouled freshman David 
Ower in the penalty box. 

Chico State, now 3-3 in the 
CCM and 7-4 overall, was unable 
to crack the tough Triton defense. 
Junior goalie Ryan \Veirich made 
four saves for UCSD to earn his 
second shutout of the year. 
Eastment could only manage one 
save.

the twO tea ms combining for 54

A s Bonds sits on the cusp of 
immortality, I would 
be remiss if I didn't 
discuss his latest 
quest for glory. 

But before I do, therc 's one 
thing I have to make clear: I do not 
like Barry Bonds. 

I respect his athletic achieve-
ments, but I clo not believe it givcs 
him an excusc to be an egotistical 
jackass. However, this article isn't 
about how much I hate Barry 
Bonds - anyone who really wants 
to hear more can ca ll the sPOrts 
office and I wi ll tell them my exact 
feelings about Bonds. 

Now that my disclaimer is out 
of the way, I'll discuss why I sup-
port Bonds breaking McGwire's 
home run record. 

First of all , I never thought he'd 
come even close. Even at the AlI-
Star break - even in early 
September - I doubted him. But 
he has put himself in a position to 
do it and render yet another of my 
sports predictions incorrect. 

One of the main benefits of 
Boncls' flirtation with the record 
books - besides allowing all my 
friends to remind me daily about 
how wrong I was - is the attention 
it has received. 

While not exactly equaling 
McGwire's ocean of media cover-
age in 1998 when he broke Roger 
Maris' record..it has still captured a 
lot of attention from the press, and 
more importantly from baseball 
fans. Aeros America, everyone is 
asking, "Did Bonds hit another one 
today'" 

It has given many people some-
thing posi tive to focus 011, some-
thing good to walch instead of the 
dire reports of imminent war, 
refugees, prisoners and biological
