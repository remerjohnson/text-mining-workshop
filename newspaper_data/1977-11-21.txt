Marijuana 
researched 
at UCSD 

by Reed AJpert 
Associate News Editor 

The re are a few , select 
ituations in California when it 

is thoroughly legal to smoke 
marij uana. 

One of them is under the 
au pices of Dr. David Janow-
ky, a professor of psychiatry 

at t he VA and University 
hospita ls , who con.ducts 
researc h with marijuana . 
Recently he has completed 
three stu4ies concerning the 
effects of marijuana on 
coordination and interpersonal 
relations. 

The first study measured ~he 
performance of airplane pilots 
in a flight simulator after they 
had smoked an amount of 
government grown marijuana 
equal to one third of a cigarette. 

"The flying ability of the 
pilots was grossly deterior-
ated," reported Janowsky . 
They tended to forget where 
they were in space when trying 
to complete a complex pattern, 
he added. 

The marijuana used in the 
stu dies co mes from the 
Nati onal Institute of Drug 
Abuse (NIDA) and is grown in 
Mississippi. The subjects in the 
three experiments consumed 
an am ount of marijuana 
containing six milligrams of 
THC, the active ingredient in 
marijuana. In. order to deter-
mine the extent of the high this 
amo unt of THC produces , 
Janowsky had his subjects rate 
the high on a zero to 10 scale, 10 
being the highest they've ever 
been. "The high the subjects 
usually attain is in the eight to 
10 range," said ~anowsky, 
" However, whe'n we have 
subjects mix drugs, like alcohol 
and marijuana, we get reports 
of 25 on the 10 point scale." 

FDA regulations 
According to an FDA regula-

tion, the subjects who smoke 
the marijuana must be males 
and have smoked before. "The 
government is worried," 
expla ined Janowsky, "that 
there ha ven 't been enough tests 
to show marijuana is safe for a 
woman who ' s pregnant. 
They're probably stricter about 
this regulation than the one 
saying subjects must have a 
history of smoking. They don't 
want to turn anybody on who 
hasn't been turned on before." 

The two interpersonal 
relations experiments took 
place in a small room in the V A 
hospital. The walls are light 
yellow, the carpet 8 green

Reduction in fees 
rejected by Regents 
Student Regent Salerno abstains from 
yote because of "personal benefits" 

A proposal which would have reduced UC's educational fee by 
$51 per year was rejected by the UC Board of Regents last Friday. 
UC President David Saxon, who had made the proposal, said after 
the decision that he would continue his efforts to reduce the fee . 

Requiring a simple majority to pass, the proposal only garnered 
a 6-6 split among the Regents with two abstentions. Student Regent 
Michael Salerno, who had previously come out in favor of the 
proposal, abstained from the voting on the ground that he is a 
student at UC Davis law school and would personally benefit from 
a reduction in the fee. The other abstaining Regent, Joseph Moore, 
gave no explanation for his failure to vote . 

A ... pliDS of the aotorioal weed that ie heiDS coalamed at 
UCSD - all ia the aame of IdeDce, of coarH. 

Regent Vilma Martinez, who normally is considered a liberal on 
most issues, voted against the measure because she felt that if the 
state were to have control over the funding , it could cut back on 
those programs which would be dependent on the money, 
Educational Opportunity Program and the student affirmative 
action program, thus having a negative effect on minority 
students. 

The Regents also auti)orized their Counsel, Donald Reidhaar, to 
file suit against the state Fair Political Practices Commission 
(FPPC) if the commission continues to demand that the Regents 
disclose full financial statements, including a detailed report of 
their private holdings. 

Saxon set to meet 
with faculty - again The Regents want the FPPC to allow only limited disclosure, 

revealing only those interests which do business with the 
university or hold any property within two miles of a university 
laboratory or campus. 

UC President David Saxon, 
whose visit here two years ago 
touched off a large anti-CIA 
demonstration, is scheduled to 
meet tomorrow in an informal 
discussion per~..Q~ with >the 
Academic Senate. / 

According to chairman John 
Miles, the senate has asked 
Saxon to discuss a 'variety of 
topics, including future trends 
in teaching workloads , the 

Mandell 
steps down 
as cha_ir 

Dr. Arnold J. Mandell, the 
UCSD psychiatric professor 
who w~s placed on J;Jledical 
probatidn for writing excessive 
prescriptions of drugs to 
members of the San Diego 
Chargers, has resigned as co-
chairman of the psychiatry 
department. 

Dr. John H. Moxley III, dean 
of the medical school, said 
Mandell's decision has nothing 
to do with his being put on 
probation . Mandell said he 
resigned because he feels he 
has outlived his usefulness to 
the department. 

Mandell will continue to 
serve as a professor in the 
d~partment and is looking 
forward to doing some research 
that he has been considering for 
20 years. Mandell founded the 
psychiatry department in 1989. 

balance between large and 
small UC campuses and the 
"sensitivity of UC policies to 
social issues ." 

When he was here two years 
ago, Saxon was also scheduled 
to meet with the S"enate . 
However, that meeting was 
postponed when a group of 
students, angry that Saxon 
would not pledge an end to UC 
ties with the CIA, crowded into 
the senate's meeting room. 

The demonstration resulted 
in disciplinary hearings called 
by Chancellor McElroy for ten 
UCSD students who partici-
pa ted in it. Eigh t of those 
students were eventually 
placed on academic probation 
for t~o quarters. 

"There are already statuates on the books that provide 
remedies for those who have conflicts of interest. I don 't think I 
should have to make all of my assets totally public," explained 
Regent Dean Watkins, an attorney. 

The UC educational fee is currently $300 a year for 
undergraduates and $360 for graduate students. Saxon's proposal 
would have it reduced only if California agreed to provide $6.7 
million to replace the revenue that would be lost by reducing the 
fee . . 

The $6.7 million would be used to finance the Educational 
Opportunity Program (EOP) , which provides financial assistance 
for disadvantaged students, and the Affirmative Action program, 
which is used to recrut minority students and provide services for 
them. Both programs are currently financed by the tuition. 

Even if Saxon's proposal would have passed it would not have 
been reflected in a reduction of fees for UC students, as the 
university has authorized a minimum $48 increase per year of the 
registration fee (which includes the educational fee) , and further 
increases are expected.

'View' reviewer 
too 'subjective' 

TT ignores right to censor ads 

I am writing simply to 
quation both the taste and the 
ethics involved in priDtinI Jill 
Bazeley's review of View From 
TIle BrIdIe (Monday. Nov. 14). 
I do not object to Ma. Baaeley's 
review in and gf itlelf - 81 aD 
audience member sbe is 
eDtitled to tbiDk wbatever abe 
pleases - however. I found the 
public exposure of these hiJbly 
subjective opiDlons botb 
unprofessional and unneces-
sarily damaging. We are writini this letter to ask the editorial board of the. 

Triton Times to consider 
refusing to publish advertising 
copy which is blatently sexist. 
As an example, let us mention 
the ad for Akai stereo compon-
ents, which has been running 
for the last several weeks. It 
features an "attractive" 
woman, wearing a provocative 
T-shirt, on which is printed the 
imaginative slogan: "I Give 
One of Life's Great Perform-
ances." 

Now. we fully realize and 
appreciate the importance of 
freedom of the press - but we 
believe that the editors of the 

Triton Times have both the 
rilht and obligation to refuse 
advertising which is offensive 
to many people - women and 

lJ'I~n alllre. 
The exploitation of natural 

sexual instincts for commer-
cial purposes can only inhibit 
the formation of healthy human 
relationships as it teaches us to 
regard people as commodities. 
It is. about time that the 

'American business sector 
began to realize that the boditls 
of attractive women are not 
merely sexual objects for them 
to use as merchandizing tools. 

The refusal of newspaper and ' 
magazines to publish such 

obviously stupid and debuman-
izing advert.iJements could be a 
good first step in this direction.

literary exhibitionism before 
she submits her reviews for

Ihanksgiving Food Drive 
Jlelps feed hungry people 

Papers .o,n a world of,subjects 
Do you want to help hungry people but don't know how to go 

about it? An opportunity to put your good intentions into action 
is coming soon: The Second Annual Thanksgiving Food Drive. 
sponsored by the campus Christian organizations will be held 
November 21.22 and 23 at Revelle Plaza. Students will be abl to 
buy foodstuffs and donate them back to be taken to the Casa de 
los Pobres (House of the Poor) in Tijuana. 

This is a Catholic run community center serving the needs of 
the poor and destitute. Hot breakfasts and lunches are served 
daily and bags of groceries are provided weekly. Clothes are 
also available. In addition. the Casa offers a variety of medical 
and dental services. referring serious cases to doctors better 
equipped to handle them. Recipients are screened before 
receiving aid, and efforts are made to provide jobs to as many 
as possible. 

"'or some time now, students at UC Santa Barbara known as 
the Association of Los Ninos have been going down to the Casa 
de los P?bres three times a month, bringing food and giving 
lessons 10 manual labor to the children. This Thanksgiving 
UCSD students can also have a part in touching the lives of the 
poor in Tijuana, 

See you at Revelle Plaza! 

by Roger Cohen 
The what journal, you may 

ask? The Politjournal! It is an 
interdisciplinary annual 
publication of outstanding 
papers written by UCSD's 
Social Science students. This 
year's Politjournal contains 
eight articles, among them are 
ones on thought reform in post-
revolution China. the contro-
versy over porpoise kills, the 
question of Zionism equalling 
Racism. and an examination of 
Soviet-American trade. 

- This year'sjournal contains a 
few waves of brilliance in a sea 
of mediocrity. Every article 
has merit. just as every drop of 
water does, but few reach the 
crest ofthewave. The "Psycho-
logical Models for Soviet-
American Trade." written by 
Willard Stone does mount these 
waves. The autbor's analysis of 
political actions in psycho-
logical perspectives yields a 
creative article. The conclusion 
that "the United States has 
little chance of gaining 
substantial benefits of any kind 
from Soviet-American trade" 
raises the question of why the 
U.S. still pursues a trade policy 
with Russia? 

Another thought provoking 
paper was Brian Loe's critical 
analysis of the Dependencia 
Theory. The author chips the 
monolithic and expansive 
theory down to "a critique of 
capitalism as it-relates to Latin 
America ... (and not) an all 
inclusive indictment of the 
world structure that the 
theorists envision." . 

Yet most articles suffer from 
two ailments: first. burying 
exciting and stimulating ideas 
under stacks of facts; and 
second. writing in jargon. The 
first problem is most apparent 
in the articles on the tuna 
industry and on O.P.E.C. But 
this problem can also be a 
blessing for anyone research-
Ing these subjects, since the 
articles serve not only 8S 
excellent sources but also 88 an 
outstanding bibliographical 
reference. 

The second problem. that of 
writing jargon to impress 
rather than elucidate, plagues 
virtually every article. One 
such example occurs in the 
article on "Psychological 
Models for Soviet-American

that tension will be reduced ... 
"to negligible levels. however, 

. by ample external justification 
of prospects for ' spectacular

me. .

on the quality of papers which

Moll", November 21, 1877 

"Too True 
to be Good" 
is just that 

by Jill Louise Bazeley 
Arts Writer 

"Too True to be Good," now 
pl aying at the Old Globe 
Theatre is just that- too true to 
be good. Director Mark Lamos' 
didactic treatment of Shaw's 
ultra-serious play misses 
because serious plays do not 
alway s have to be played 
serious. With Shaw, matter is 
best disguised as mirth just as 
with Wilde, or in any farce, 
mirth decked out as matter 
(otherwise known as deadpan) 
is the tidiest way of going about 
things. Lamos (last summer's 
Hamlet) does use silliness to a 
great extent to bolster up "Too 
True to be Good," but silliness 
often degenerate-s into a 
horrid amalgam of melo- ' 
drama, message and much ado 
about nothing. 

Indeed, the play, subtitled "a 
political extravaganza," 'deals 
with a good many messages 
about the pompo'sities of 
politics, sex, society, the 
military, what have you, but 
these should be presented in 
a deft, underhand way, waxed 
on the underside to glide along 
as a flawless, unstopping far<;,e. 

.... 

The story is 01 a rich young 
invalid who is talked into 
stea Ii ng her own pearl necklace 
and taking part in an absurd 
abduction scheme by a preach-
er turned thief and a chamber-
maid turned nurse, all for a cut 
in the profit. Eventually, all the 
cha racters end up at an 
undesignated army post in the 
antipodes where they meaning-
lessly discuss and debunk life's 
conseq uential issues and 
institutions ad nauseum. 

1 

The political conscience of 
the play, however, has nothing 
to do with these empty-headed 
people, and by cutting the slimy 
monster from Act I, Lamos 
obfuscates Shaw's clear 
delineation between reality and 

~he characters of "Too True to 
be Good," while at the same 
time maming the theme so 
severely that the play becomes 
something of a melodramatic 
homily by the end of Act III. 
The play, designed to be an 
absurd comedy; is taken 
altogether too seriously by the 
Old Globe. Usually, if you aska 
stu pid question, you get a 
stupid answer, but not with this 
play you don't . 

Fortunately, there is some 
very fine acting in the produc-
tion, though it would be even 
better if it didn' t have to adhere 
to Lamos' stupid interpretation 
of the play. Deborah Taylor, 
Kelsey Grammar, Valerie 
Snyder, Craig Fisch, Paul 
Eggington and John Napierala 
are all delightful and their 
performances are marred only 
by their inconsistent, and 
strange English accents as well 
as their poor sense of the 
rhythmic pattern of English 
spee ch (Va lerie Snyder 
excepted). 

The scenery for "Too True to 
be Good" brings applause and 
rightfully so. Act I trots out the 
Worst of taste in yards and 
yards of batiste and Austrian 
pour curtains, while Act II 
changes to a cleverly designed 
and sand dune setting. (The 
~and even shirts - you can hear 
Its casters between the scenes.) 
Most impressive, however, is 
the slide show on the stage 
Curtain before Act I. Designed 
by Russell Redmond, the 
projections give the playa 
~ense of period, something that 
IS not clearly defined by the 
text. When the projections and 
their accompanying music stop 
and the curtain slides up into an 
Austrian pouf, the stage is set 
perfectly - reality ends and 

triton times 

Shaw'. "Too Trae to be Good," currently playing.t The Old Glob-e Theatre, often degenerates into "much ado aboat nothing." 

VA Dept. to get distinctive new prof 
by Debbie Schwartz 
Contributing Editor 

The Visual Arts Department 
is excited! and with good 
reason : Winter quarter will 
bring a diStinctive new 
member to its faculty. Ray-
mond Durgnat, who is current-
ly at Berkeley, will be teaching 
History of Film (V A 84) and a 
196 special projects course in 
film criticism. 

Durgnat studied English 
Literature at Pembroke , 
College in Cambridge, England ' 
and film at'the Slade School of 
Fine Arts, London. His impres-
sive bllckground includes such 
positions as part-time lecturer 
at Royal College of Art, Head of 
the Department of History of 
A rt and Complementary 

Studies at St. Martins School of 
Art in London, Associate 
Professor for the Department 
of Film Studies at Queen' s 
University in Kingston , 
Ontario, Canada , Visiting 
Professor at the School of Fine 
Arts at Colombia University in 
New York, and freelance 
author of various books, 
articles, and film scripts. He 
was also president of the 
London Film-Makers Co-
operative from 1965-1968. 

One extraordinary facet of 
Durgnat's work is the broad 
scope of his approach. With an 
inquisitive and exploratory 
outlook, he has examined the 
films of such diverse directors 
as Jean' Renoir, Alfred Hitch-
cclck, Luis Bunuel, a'nd the 
Marx Brothers, to name just a

few. His formal background 
lends an intellectual vigor to 
the field of film criticism, 
which has only recently gained 
respectability as an academic 
activity. 

The general focus of Durg-
nat's sense of film-is psycholog-
ical: His emphasis on how the 
experience of cinema interacts 
with the fundamental psycholo-
gy of the human condition is 
what m'akes him unique among 
film ci'itics, This is especially 
evident in his book, Films and 
Feelings. Standish Lawder, 

head of the Visual Arts 
Department, says of Durgnat, 
" His thoughts and articulations 
are a guide througb the endless 
psychological landscape 
between us and the screen." 

Lawder speculates many 
favorable outcomes in the 
addition of Durgnat to the 
Visual Arts staff. It is the 
integration of theory and 
practice that makes for good 
filmmaking and Lawder feels 
that many of Durgnat's ideas 
will be stimulating for students 
in both respects.

are obtamed at the circulation 

desk. On reserve to be used with 
these two types of audio visual

Anyone wi th a computer 
account may operate them. For 
the true computer enthusiast 
there is the Plato terminal, the

" you can play chess on it if you 
want. " 

The Cluster Undergraduate 
Library has always housed the 
Spoken Word Collection . This

and cassettes, upon which are 
recorded plays (" we have three 
or four versions of each 
Shakespeare play ," says

documentaries and folk tales. 
Due to a large demand, the 
Center has ordered a recording 
of the Bakke debate. There are 
no musical recordings in this 
collection. 

Materials in the Spoken Word 
Collection are listed in both the 
Cluster card catalog and the 
Playback Center's card 

catalog. Reserve materials are 
listed in a separate drawer in 
the Playback Center. Material 
is dispensed by Center Super-
visor Jill Jordon and seven 

student librarians upon 
presentation of request and I.D. 
cards . Says student Jibrarian 
Naomi Uchida , "the first time 
we show them how to work the 
machines, then we just give 
them the stuff and let them do it 
themselves." 

The Playback Center now 
exists on a two-year experi-
mental basis, and is supported 
with instructional improve-
ment funds . The Center does 
not produce A V material or 

lend out its equipment. Its 
fundamental purpose is meant 
to be that of a reserve facility , 
although according to Jill 
Jordon, " the Spoken Word 
Collection is still used the 
most. "

Marijuana ••• 
(Conlinued from nalEe I ~ 

adorned excepL for a solitary 
Japanel>c print. The first 
experiment consisted of a 
therapist and volunteer 
conducting an interview with 
the therapist whQ either had 
smoked, not smoked, or had 
smoked a placebo (marijuana 
with the active ingredients 
removed). Having smoked no 
marijuana during the experi-
ment, the volunteer was asked 
to discuss difficult times in his 
or her life. 

Subsequently, both partici-
pants rated the therapist on 
some interpersonal skills such 
as warmth, empathy, genuine-
ness, and acceptance. On the 
average Janowsky found that 
the therapist was given a low 
performance rating in these 
skills. However, there seemed 
to be two distinct clusters in the 
data, one whose ratings were 
lower\ and a smaller one whose 
ratings were higher. 

" It seems that those who are 
more withdrawn in their 
emotions normally, tended to 
become more withdrawn after 
they had smoked," explained 
Janowsky, " and those thera-
pists who seemed to be more 
carefree and open with their 
feelings became more open and 
formed the smaller group that 
was rated higher in the skills." 

Another effect noticed by 
Janowsky was that when the 

together. 
"In order to .have some 

backgrounds for the subjects 
we talked to them about how 
long they've 'smoked, how old 
they are, how long they've 
known each other, and things 
like that," said Janowsky, "We 
haven't analyzed the data yet, 
but the kinds of things we're 
looking for are how welJ the two 
friends communicate, the 
forms of communication they 
use, how they perceive each 
other in terms of traits like 
empathy and acceptance , 
changes in their moods, and if 
they resonate moods or not. 

Mechanism in brain 
How marijuana, and many 

drugs, do what they do is still a 
wide open question. "There's 
really very little knowledge 
about the nature of the 
mechanism in the brain," said 
J anowsky, "It's still pretty 
much speculative , although 
there are a bunch of theories ." 

It appears that marijuana , 
along with many other drugs, 
may affect neurotransmitters, 
the c hem i cal s t hat car r y-
messages between brain cells. 
Three of these drugs, norepine-
phrine, serotonin, and dopa-
mine, have been mentioned in 
connection with ampheta -
mines, sedative tranquilizers 
and cocaine in addition to 
marijuana . But an understand-
ing of how these drugs work is 
still eluding researchers.

with the chemotherapy for 
cancer patients as the therapy 
can induce nausea." 

It has also been suggested 
that it could be useful in 
treating glaucoma, a disease 
where the pressure of the fluid 
in the eyeball increases . 

. Marijuana can reduce the 
pressure. Recently a glaucoma 
victim, after a long legal fight , 
was allowed to use marijuana 
to treat his glaucoma because it 
is the only effective treatment 
available. 

"The only major negative 
side effect of marijuana other 
than loss of coordination in 
performing complex tasks, " 
continued Janowsky, "is that it 
can cause bronchitis, leading to ' 
smoker's hack brought on by 
the inflammation of the 
bronchial tubes leading to the 
lungs ." Currently it appears 
that marijuana smoke is not 
carcinogenic, he added. 

As for overdosing on mari-
juana, the lethal dose{or rats is 
about 750 milligrams of THC 
per kilogram of body weight. 
Assuming approximately the 
same rate for humans, a person 
weighing 50 kg. (110 Ibs.) would 
have to smoke about 6,000 joints 
to overdose. 

In order to obtain the 
government marijuana Janow-
sky must wade through "a lot" 
of red tape. He must apply to 
the FDA and pass several 
review boards, a process that 
can take eight months or 
longer. "The government 
makes it very difficult to obtain 
the ' marijuana," commented 
Janowsky, "and if anything, 
they're get~ing worse~ The 
committee that approves all 
the appropriations seems to be 
getting more conservative." 

In the future Janowsky 
intends to look at the effects 
other drugs on communication 
and coordination. Experiments 
similar to the ones he has done 
with interpersonal relations 
will be run using drugs such as 
alcohol, valium, and anti-
depressant drugs .
