Noon Mus'ic Brought to Lawn by KSDT 
By Kathy Huffer 

Associate News Editor 
Students who take a lunch 

time break on the hump across 
from the gymnasium will soon 
hear the sound of musiC drifting 
from outside speakers set up by 
UCSD 's radio station KSDT. 

KSDT . which normally 
broadcasts only to cable 
subscribers . will use a 
separate y tem to air music to 
students on a daily basis . 
Broadcast of music and public 
a nnouncement wil begin 
sometime this qu a rter , 
acco rding to Ralph Hawkin , 
KSDT Business Manager. 

According to Hawkins , the 
tation will air more " hits-

oriented" music than it does in 
its normal broadcasts and will 
encourage students to express 
their mu ic preferences to 
KSDT members. 

Approximately 80 percent of 
the broadcasting will be music 
while the remainder will 
contain free public ' service 
messages for various student 
organizations, said Hawkins. 
No commercia ls will be 
included in the programming, 
which will be aired from 11: 45 
am to I : 15 pm each week day , 
Hawkins said., 

The radio program will be a 
perma nent a ddition to the 
campu and will be aired daily , 
unles it is pre-empted by other 

programming , including 
rallies , on the gym steps. 
according to Scott Ellsberg, 
KSDT Engineer. 

The AS has contributed two 
outdoor speakers for the 
project. In 'addition, a new 
amplifier bought by the AS will 
be installed at a total 
equipment cost of $670, KSDT 
figures show, 
, KSDT currently owes the AS 

money for financial support the 
station received to help place it 
on a cable system. The funding 
provided by the AS for sound 
equip'ment will be for student 
purposes and " is not sinking 
more money into KSDT ," 

according to AS President John 
Jenkel. 

If the lun chtime broad-
casting is successful, Hawkins 
says , KSDT may consider 
expanding the program. But a 
major deterrent to expansion, 
he added, would be the 'high 
a dditional cost of each-location. 

Because the speakers will be 
located outdoors, KSDT will 
invest in security equipment to 
prevent losses due to theft , 
according to Elisberg. 

Broadcasting, which was 
originally planned for early this 
quarter, has been postponed 
until the station receives the 
speakers and amplifiers being 
built by a San Diego company 

<;ometime this quarter, 
Elisberg said. 

KSDT News Director Steve 
Schreiner says the hump was 
c hosen as the broadcasting 
location be<;ause " it seems to 
be a place where people 
congregate ." Other areas were 
under consideration, he 
commented, "But for basic 
starters, this seems to be the 
place to go. " 

The radio program will be a 
permanent addition to the 
campus and wil be aired daily 
unless it pre-e mpts other 
programming , including 
rallies , at the ' gym steps, 
according to Ellsberg.

Will 'Increase Student Ties' 

By Eric Harpell 
Slarr Writer 

In response to what Muir 
Co llege Assistant Dean Don 
Raub describes as a " lack of 
trong student ties with the 

college ," the Muir College 
Council and Programming 
Committee have decided to 
convert the college's lower 
Muir commons into a " Muir 
College Center." 

The center, scheduled to open 
next fall . will provide students 
with telephone and personal 
infOimation. suggestion1boxes, 
change service and a "rec 
center operation, ,. according to 
Raub . "Students who will work 
there (at the information desk) 
will be part of the student 
leadership of the college," said 
Raub. The information desk , to 
be located in what is now the 

Muir television lounge, will be 
surrounded by a s tudent 
lounge. he said. 

In addition, a conference 
room will be located at the 
center where students 
organiza tions such as the Muir 
College Council. the Muir 
Programming Board and the 
Commuter Board will have a 
common meeting place. 

"In a sense," explained 
Raub , " We are saying, 'We 
believe in what you (the student 
organizations) are doing. ' " 
Raub also feels that a common 
meeting place will promote 
more interaction between 
student leaders. 

Also located at the center will 
be the Muir Program Coor-
dinator's ofCice. a workroom 
where tudents can paint 
banners and similar campu -

related art work. a nd the 
a lready existing game room. 

The fate of Page One, the 
current Muir counseling and 
information center , is 
undecided . said Raub . 
Originally intended to provide 
counseling for students, Page 
One now primarily provides 
information and serves as a 
" burnout center" during finals 
week. 

The College Center will take 
over the " burnout" function of 
providing nacks 24 hours a day 
during finals week, said Raub. 

The Muir College Center will 
be financed by the pinball 
machines in the game room and 
will be financially self-
sufficient , said Raub . Cur-
rently. profits from the pinball 
machine go into salaries for 
the game room operators . 

Slates Open Election Efforts 
'Question Authority' Buttons 
Lead to Viola~ion Charge 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Associa&e Manaling Editor 

AS election campaigning is 
only one day old, and already 
talk of campaign violations 
abounds. 

Barry Hyman, "Common 
Sense" Presidential candidate, 
told those gathered for Monday 
night's candidates meeting that 
the !'Question Authority" slate, 
led by Carlo Montalvo , was 
circulating campaign buttons 
before cam paigning was 
permissible .under the AS 
election codes. 

Phil Ganezer , Elections 
Commissioner , told the 
assembled candidates that 
what Montalvo's slate did " is 
an elections violation," but 
Hyman has agreed not to file a 
complaint against Montalvo in 
exchange for Montalvo'S 
agreement not to use any of the 
buttons unless they are charged 
to the Question Authority 
spending limit of $125 , 
according to representatives of 
both slates. 

However, that compromise 
has not placated Arturo 
Herrera , an independent Vice 
Presidentia I candidate. He said 
yesterday h e will file a 
campaign _ violation charge 
agai nst the Question Authority 
slate, claiming that the slate 
started campaigning before the 
permissible noon yesterday 
deadline. 

Montalvo argues that his 
slate didn 't corne up with the 
Question Authority name until 
last weekend, and was just 
hoping to capitalize on the 
publicity the buttons had 
garnered while used by no-nuke 
demonstrators acros the state. 
He also say tha t he and hi 
slate member have worn the 
buttons, but will not do so 
during the campaign. 

Candidates Meeting 
In other bu ine s, David 

Hartwell , Communications 
Commissioner, told the 
candidates that they will not be 
a llowed to use the AS 
typesetter until the Media 
Board has developed a system 
to give all candidates equal 
access to the machine . 
Hartwell says some candidates 
have special access to the 
typesetter in their capacities as 
media or AS officials, giving 
other candid ates an unfair 
disadvantage. 

Slate affiliations . will not be 
on the ballot because students 
should " know the candidates, 
and not just make a choice for 
the office based on the name of 
the slate," elections officia ls 
said . 

There are four slate running 
candidates , though the 
Que stio n Authority and 
" Serving Students ... We 
Deliver" slates. while claiming 
they are separate. a re viewed 
by most election observers a 
a llied.

Qeinion 
Editorial: Elections 

AJlyone conceraecl with campus ecology has noticed by 
DOW tbat campailning for Alsociated Students government 
poeitJoDl has begun. Posters, banners and leaflets have 
ionundated every corner of concrete that candidates can 
legally find to post their propaganda. 

'I1Ie Gaardian has planned its election coverage in an 
attempt to give students an objective, informative look at 
tbe candidates and what they are doing and saying. 

Below are the main features of this planned coverage: 
On the Wednesday before elections (April 18) we will 

publish an elections supplementd with statements from and 
photographs of all the candidates. It will also include the 
referendum questions and a list of open AS cOlPmittees. 
-Wednesday of that week, the first of the two days of 
voting, we ' will publish an election supplement with 
statements from and photographs of the candidates for 
president, vice-president and commissioner; 
-letters representative of those we receive concerning the 
election will be printed throughout the campaign. No letter 
over 250 worqs about any election issue or candidate will be 
printed; 
-we will not print endorsements for any office, Our 
coverage, we hope , will allow students to make informed 
decisions about the candidates without our 
recommendations. In addition, we, like many of the 
candidates, spend much of our time at the Student Center. 
The people on our edit.orial board know many of the 
candidates and consider many of them good friends. We 
simply cannot avoid a serious conflict of interest if we 
choose to ·endorse. 

To date, there have been two instances of less than honest 
behavioa: on the part of some of the candidates. 

Duri", the first week of this quarter the new indicator ran 
two front page articles criticiZing members of the AS, in 
particular Carlos Montalvo, one of the presidential 
candidates. On the same front page appeared a flattering 
story on presidential candidate Barry Hyman's work as AS 
Student Welfare Commissioner. 

The two critical stories were under the bylines Robert 
East and Charles Patterson, both pseudonyms for Jon 
Bekken, who ia running with Hyman on the "Common 
Sense" slate. The obvious boost those stories would give to 
the Common Sense campaigl1, if they were true, and the 
failure of the new Indicator to identify the overtly political 
nature of those stories showed a serious lack of integrity on 
the part of the paper. 

However, Bekken and the new indicator aren't the only 
ones at fault. Although the actions of the new indicator are 
far more serious, we also regard as le88 than honest the 
choice of some members of what was to become the 
"Question Authorit:(' slate to wear "Question Authority',' 
buttons prior to the beginning of the campaigning period. 
The re8~nse to the buttons was excellent, they say. People 
were CUriOUS about them, and applauded their sentiment. 

When "Question Authority" turned up as the slate's 
name, though , Barry Hyman rightfully saw an obvious 
campaign violation. As soon as they began considering that 
name for the slate , the buttons s'hould have been avoided by 
those on the slate who did wear them: Montalvo, Linda 
Sabo, Olivier Kolpin and Nancy Laga .

Nukes Costly to Close 
Construction Payments Would Go on Anyway 

By Martin Brown 
Pacific News Service 

Anti-nuclear act ivi sts a re 
pointing at the Three Mile 
Island power plant disaster as 
the ultima te evidence for 
turning the tide against nuclear 
power a nd shutting down the 
nation 's e ntire nu c lear 
network. 
Martin ' Brown, former West 
Coasl coordinator for Science 
in the Public Interest, is science 
editor of PNS. He is also editor 
of The Social Responsibility of 
the Scientist. 

But turning off the nuclear 
switch may prove at least as 
difficult, a nd as dangerous, as 
the uncertain efforts to cool off 
Three Mile Island . For to 
contemplate such a move is to 
confront one of the more tragic 
ironies of nuclear power: 
because of the huge cost of 
atomic reactors, the industry 
considers its economic 
cO!'1mitment to nuclear power 
as j rreversible as an un-
controlled meltdown. From the 
public point of view, the 
monetary cost and radiation 
hazards involved in "decom· 
missioning" plants a re still 
unknown , though certain to be 
extremely high. 

Leaving aside the kilowatt 
costs of operating a n lear 
power plant. as compared to 
conventiona l power plants, 
let' s look at the cost of not 
operating them. It is far more 
expensive to shut down a 
nuclear power plant than a 
conventional plant even before 
the cost of disposal of 
radioactive materi a ls is 
counted in. 

This is because some 90 
percent of the electric 
generating costs of a nuclear 
plant a re accounted for in the 
construction of the plant itself. 
Conventional power plant 
construction costs only 50 to 60 
~ercent 'of the electric 
generating cost. 

As a result, for most utilities 
nuclear power plants mean 
long·term bank financing -
enormous loans that must be 
paid off whether or not the plant 
ever generates electricity and 
profit. 

This " front·end loading" of 
the cost of nuclear power. 
compared to conventional 
power. means that nuclear 
plants are normally much less 
flexible in their operating 
schedule. Any shutdown, evena 
short·term one for inspection or 
repairs, is costly because the 

lost production value coun ts 
mainly against the cost of the 
pl an t cons truction . The 
monthly or quarterly bank 
payments become due whether 
the plant is operating or not. 

The same is true, of course, 
for conventional power plants. 
but less so . When a con-
ventional power plant is 
temporarily shut down, the 
value of the lost production is 
largely counted against fuel 
that isn't burned. A sma ller 
portion of the loss counts 
against the plant construction 
cost. 

If a temporary shutdown of a 
nuclear plant is expensive, the 
costs of turning the plants off 
forever is staggering. This is all 
the more true because of the 73 
nuclear power plants in 
operation today are -relatively 
new, having come on line in the 
late 1960s or 1970s. Thus, they 
have generated only a small 
portion of .the 30 to 40 years of 
electric production for which 
they were designed, a nd on 
which the utilities depend for a 
profitable financial return. 

THE 
GUARDIAN 

Letter to the Editor 

If all the nuclear power 
plants were shut down today. 
the utili tiE'S - and no doubt 
ra tepayers - would nonethe-
less be paying billions of dollars 
for them for the next 20 to 30 
years .

Professor Clarifies Remarks 
Editor: 

In last Wednesday 's 
G!lardlan (April 4, 1979), John 
Klock wrote well about our 
previous Monday's discussion 
of the incident at the Three Mile 
Island Nuclear Power Plant. 
But I must comment on matters 
of perspective and emphasis . 

First, the matter of 
competence needs a larger 
context. Klock moved this topic 
from the tail of our discussion to 
the head o( his article. I 
emphasized that our whole 
national competence needs 
attention and that it is not 
proper for those of us in 
universities. faculty or student, 
to point hypercritical fingers at 
other groups. Rather, we have 
a weighty responsibility. I wish 
to add here that the employees 
at the Three Mile I land Plant 
were a competent as our 
universities and other 
educational and training 

programs provide. Thus. if my 
finger points, it is at me and 
you. I would like to have 
conveyed the idea that groups 
further removed from the 
technology tend to have the 
greater need to improve their 
knowledge of our tools and our 
risks. The core of the nuclear 
industry is exceptionally 
competent. 

I must correct an error that r 
perpetrated Monday . I now 
know that the operator error 
was not related to the shutdown 
of the emergency core COOling 
sy tem but rather to the 
circumstance · that the 
auxiliary feed water system did 
not operate. . 

Second , on Monday I 
attempted to put in per pective 
the reported relea es of 
radioactivity. Here , I will 
translate the numbers to more 
familiar terms. The estimated 

peak dose presents a lifetime 
cancer risk to the population 
around Three Mile Island 
comparable to the following 
alternative common risks : 
Consumption of 50,000 packs of 
cigarettes. a few smokes for 
each person in the population or 
the yearly consumption of 
fewer th a n 200 inveterate 
smokers. The consumption of 
one or two dozen peanut butler 
sa ndwiches each. Moving 
100,000 persons from sea level 
to Denver. Total U.S. jet air 
traffic for one or two days. I am 
not attempti ng humor nor 
advocati ng risks (excepting a 
few favorite such as skiing) . I 
wouLd urge thelt each of us think 
through the benefits of all of 
these and other risks: eve n 
more, the risks attending 
excessive preoccupation with 
any single one. 

John P. Howe 
Adjunet Professor of 
Nuclf'W' Engineering 

This inflexibility is even 
more true for the 90 nUclear I 
plants that are currently under 
construction. Pacific Gas and 
Electric, for instance, would 
have to payoff the entire 
construction cost of its Diablo 
Canyon plant, which is 99 
percent complete, without 
reaping a single kilowatt of 
electricity. 

This is why utilities will fight 
to continue operation of nuclear 
power plants on line or under 
construction well into the 1980s 
and 1990s - even when the 
predicted cost of nuclear power 
becomes substantially more 
than conventional power. To 
operate them may be finan-
cially unrewarding: but to 
close them would be deva-
stating. Thus , the utility 
industry can be expected to 
vigorously oppose a temporary 
or permanent shutdown of 
nuclear power plants - not out 
of any romance with the 
glamorous atom - but to 
recover their huge construciion 
expenses .

Following a 163-114 vole in 
favor of unionizing, nego-

Cook , CNA senior labor 
representative. 

It will take four to s ix w eks

nurse at the La Jolla hospital. 

" We wa nt to assure the

administration ," said Cook, 
"and we have a lready informed

to submit any disputed issues to 
impartial and binding arbitra-

join us in that pledge." 

'Why Not Here-?' Succeeds 
"CNA will help the nurses 

_ achieve their goals. " said Cook. 
"First we wish to help develop 
work policies which will enable 
the nurses to spend more time 
nursing and less time 
performing non-nursing duties, 
and secondly to help nurses 
obtain salaries comparable to 
other parts of the stale. "

Problems of Sex on Campus Told 
By Doug Campion 

Science Editor 
. 'The number one problem 

in ... relationships is communication. 
And closely related to problems in 
communication are problems in 
sexuality ." This assertion was made 
last ~week by Dr. Hugh Pates of 
Counse ling and Psychologi al 
Services to the students enrolled in 
Contemporary Issues 22 , Human 
Sexuality. Pates and Sha ron Keating, 
the director of the Contraceptive 
Counseli ng and Education Clinic, had 
been asked bycoursedirectorDr. Lola 
Ross to speak on the issue of " Sex on 
Campus." 

AI 0 emphasizing the need for 
communication between the partners 
in a relationship, Keating said. 
" There 's a whole bunch of fears a nd 
miscon eplions that men a nd women 
have a dopted (concerning sexu-
a lity) . " 

One of the common misconceptions 

Class Reveals Fallacies, Needs 
Keating referred to was that men. b~ 
nature, have a stronger sex drive than 
do women. " Women have come to 
assume that men need sex more than 
women do," she said. She added, too , 
that as a result of the acceptance of 
this myth m a ny women often make 
great efforts to accommodate their 
partner 's needs. However, according 
to Keating , women build up sex ua l 
need to the same degree that men do . 
She explained, " Women have the 
sa me needs for re leasing that exua l 
tension as men." 

Another fa ll acy which Keating aid 
is commonly a ccepted concern 
sex ua l knowledge a nd expertise. 
" Women think that men know 
everything ," she a id. " Men are 
supposed to be a uthorities on sex. " 
From her counseling students at her 

ofCice in the Student Health Center, 
though, she said she has learned 
otherwise. " Men can't know how to 
stimulate women unless they (the 
women) tell them ," she said . 

Pates noted that, especially in the 
etting of a college campus, even 

initiating relationships ca'n be 
extremely difficult. According to 
Pates , " The primary difficulty with 
sexuality on campus is 'how do I get to 
meet people?' " He mentioned that 
tudents a re often reluctant to get 

close to one another and to form 
intimate tie with those around them. 

" Getting Freudian," Pates said that 
this trepidation may stem from 
psychologica l effects that developed 
a far back as birth. In its mother's 
womb, he said. the Cetus develops in a 
.. total love environment. " It is warm.

Pates went on to say that birth, then, 
could be interpreted as the mother 
"pushing" the child away from this 
total security into a world ol threats 
and challenges. From that point on, 
according to Pates, everyone tends to 
be extremely cautious in developing' 
close relationships with other people ' 
for fear that he or she will once again 
be cast away from that security by one 
who is loved. 

Both Pates and Keating emphasized 
that sex is not something whiCh should 
be treated any different Crom other 
bodily needs and functions_ 

Pates said, "Sex is a natural 
experience - it's as natural as 
sleeping, it's as natural as eating." He 
noted that in a child's early years 
parents constantly encourage the 
development oC good eating and

Billy Hein. who has been 
plilying in the number one

Ba rry Boran, 7-5,3-6, 4-6. John

Alan Alpar, at number. three, 
brought in two singles victories

Women's Softball 
Team Gets 1st Win 

Prayers were not enough to 
s ust ai n the Cal Baptist 
women 's softball team as they 
were crushed under the power 
of the visiting Trilons last 
Friday in Riverside, 3-] 

Coach John Elliot was 
enthusiastic about the team 's 
first win. " The more ex-
perience they get, the better 
they do," he commented. 

Jill Keene remained 
consistent with her previous 
efforts in keeping her pitching 
well under control throughout 
the game. 

Elliot expressed pride in the 
achievements made by catcher 
Paula Weddel in "some key 
plays behind the plate and a 
good defensive game." The 

. coach commended the other 

team members Cor their 
" limited errors in the infield." 

By "swinging the bat and 
taking the bases one by one," 
the Tril.ons showed solid 
offensive improvement that 
helped in grabbing three runs 
off the Cal Baptist pitcher, 
according to Elliot. 

Last Thursday night th e 
UCSD team was unsuccessful 
in a scrimmage against Taft 
College. According to Elliot the 
game consisted of " experi-
mentation in trying out the 
players in different positions ... 

The Triton record now stands 
at 1-3. They will be facing the 
UC Riverside team here 
tomorrow at 3: 30 pm. 

Looking ahead, the team will 
face mostly L.A. area schools 
for the remainder of April.

.Babys Grow Old Early 

I first heard the Baby. at the 
Civic Theatre two years alG at 
one of thOle "aJmost free" 
Ibow. they used to produce 
down there; the ones that cost 
'1.01 or 80methllll like that. 
They had just released their 
second LP Broken Hearl, a 
slickly produced collection of 
pop rock that seemed to 
indicate that the band had quite 
a future In the industry. They 
had an expensive set with all 
the frills to make things easier 
for them too. 

Opening for Alice Cooper 
Monday night at the Sports 
Arena, the Babys did not live up 
to their promise of a few years 
bilck. Indeed, they looked and 
sounded like a classic example 
of too much too soon_ Too much 
coke, too many late night6 with 
too many women; the classic 
rock star syndrome. 

The main element that held 
promise for the Babys was lead

vocalist John Waite, a man with 
a voice that used to have the 
power and control of a Paul 
Rogers and the sensitivity of a 
Paul McCartney. But no more_ 
At Monday night's show, Waite 
had no upper register in his 
voice_ In another year he might 
not have a voice at all. 

The band has also gone 
through some personnel 
changes, which, it appears; 
have not really improved the 
sound. Drummer Tony Brock 
had a nice drum solo - for the 
first five minutes - before 
completely going overboard in 
a self-indulgent surge of 
drumming energy lasting what 
seemed like half an hour. 
Besides Brock's gong show, the 
rest of the band was merely 
competent. Guitarist Wally 
Stocker looked largely 
uninspired while Waite , 
dressed in Olivia Newton· 
John's Grease black stretch 

pants, didn ' t even bother to 
play bass anymore. 

A main concern for the Ba bys 
should be their image. Onstage 
the band looks confused as to 
whether they're a Bad 
Company clone or an almost 
New Wave outfit. Only their 
hairdres-ser would know for 
sure, for he must spend a 
helluva lot o( time with the boys 
henna-ing theirhair. NewWave 
henna? No way". 

F9110wing the Babys was 
Alice Cooper and his " Mad 
House Rock " show, which 
should have been called " Mad 
House Schlock." The Coop is 
one of rock ' s genui ne 
dinosaurs, an act that should 
have become extinct years ago. 
His touted set design was so 
tacky that not even Woolworths 
would want to claim credit. 
Coop, to his credit, didn't leave 
a stone unturned, using every 
single cliche known in show 
business.

Farm Boy · Falls in with Hippies: 
10 Years Later, It Works Better 

In 1968 the stage rock-
musical Hair became a 
controversial succes!\, and its 
" Aquarius" number became 
the anthem for a generation of 
flower childl'en . The problem 
with the play, though, was that 
it limited its appeal to a specific 
group to a specific time and wa 
too topical for its own good. The 
play lacked the elements to 
make it a timeless c lass ic, 
namely a good plot and strong 
characters. Really a ll Hair had 
going for it was a stunning 
musical score, and in the film of 
Hair Milos Foreman wisely 
elects to keep the score intact 
while di scarai ng almost 
everything e lse . Foreman 
makes Hair one of the year's 
most pleasant surprises as well 
as one of the most energetic 
musicals in y~ars . 

Foreman a nd sce narist 
Michael Weller have given Hair 
a more substantial plot than' the 
play had, and now the song 
relate specifically to the action 
rather than just popping up out 
of nowhere , The story opens 
with Claude (nicely played by 
John Savage) , a Midwestern 
farm boy, arrtving in 
Manhattan (or a last fling 
before his induction into the 
Army. But before he can carry 
out his plan of visiting all the 
tourist sights, he falls in with a 
group of hippies (the idea n., 
longer sounds so shocking) and 
then falls in love with a New 
Jersey debutante. 

Although the film has more of 
a plot than the play, it still lacks 
the fluidity and depth to make it 
great. The songs now tie in with 
the plot but in order to achieve 
this Weller has had to come up 
with some sudden happenings 
such as · a rejected fiancee 
abruptly popping up to bother 
Hud so that " Easy to be Hard" 
can be sung. 

The characters also develop 
a more definite shape , 
~specially in the case of the 
leads , Claude and Bel'ger. 
Claude is a naive farm boy who 
grows and gains depth through 
hi encounters with Berger's 
gang . Berger (played to 
perfection by Treat Williams) 
is now a thoroughly in-
gratiating free spiri t, more 
memorable th a n hi stage 
counterpart ever was . 

The Galt MacDermot-J ames 
Rado-Gerome Ragni score is 
done beautifully but, sadly , 
ome of the ongs have been 

omitted. Foreman has c hosen 
powerful soloists to perform . 
some of the numbers a nd his 
result , es peci a lly Cheryl 
Barnes doing "Easy to be 
Hard" and Re n Woods doing

improper sti mulation by the 
ma n. 

" It 's true ," said Keating, 
" sex i totally nUlural , but it i 
not na tura lly perfect. Sexual 
behav ior i learned." She 
reiterated the need for good 
co mmuni ca tion between 
partners. . 

Pate concluded saying that 
when becoming involved in a 

relationship with ano ther 
pe r on , one . hould not be 
primllrily concerned with " how 
long or how well" he or she 
perform sexually. " What is 
important," he said, "is that I 
feel ve ry close : to the per on." 

Keating remarked, s imilar-
ly. " Sex doesn ' t have to be a 
'success' or ' failure .' It needs to 
be a real sharing experience." 

" Peopl · tend to put sex in a 
different category , " said 
Pates, adding that if the 
absence of adequate discussion 
of the matter weren 't problem 
enough, there are oft e n 
" warnings , threats and fea rs " 
imposed on people thinking 
about sex. 

Whcn a person does become 
sexually involved with another, 
said Pates , ther e are often one 
or two difficulties sometimes 
encountered- especially in the 
first sexua l experience. The 
male , he said, will often 
develop " secondary impot-
ence." That is , as a result of 
anxiety and being nervous. he 
will not be a ble to sustain a n 
erection throughout the act of 
intercourse. Another problem 
men sometimes experience 
when they ' re first sexually 
active is rapid ejaculation . This 
too, said P ates , is due to 
an xieties a nd a pprehension 
which the ma n has built up 
prior to intercourse . 

Why Not Here? 

In their counseling women 
here , both Keating and Pates 
noted that the most com mon 
thing women are concerned 
with is that they often do not 
experience orgasm during sex. 

Keating noted that it is 
important to rea lize tha t "a 
sex ua l experience does not 
Iw e to end in orgasm for it to 
be sa ti fying." She went on to 
expla in that it is now felt that 
thi pl'Oblem is not necessa rily 
the result of some psycho-
logica l or phys ical deficiency 
on the part of the woman , but 
may in I'a 't be due simply to

Yes, Hugh "Bullsbo&" Crummond, formerly of hill Majesty's 
Royal Loamshire's, is back and starring in this outrageous 
comedy spoof. Low Moan Spectacular (&he same people who 
brought you &he smash sell-ou& EI Grande De Coca Cola) has 
cooked up Bullsbot Crummond out of the IOUp of nostalgia, 
simmered him well in bromides, platitudes, and tben garnished 
him generously wi&h old chestnu'ts fresh from 1930's grade B 
movies. The result is delicious, with lhe action revolving 
around an episode in the life of Bullshol as he matches wits 
(what little he has) with Count OUo Von Bruno, the second most 
dangerous man in Europe. Amazing on,slage situations 
include an air crash, a car era h, a sea battle between a 
destroyer and a submarine, and a chilling descent down an icy 
mountain. Bullshot Crummond is an evening of pure escapism 
as Good hilario!,lsly triumphs over Evil. 

Bullshot Crummond will play Thursday, April 12, in the 
Mandeville Auditorium at 8 pm. Students are $3, and general 
admission is $5.50. Produced by University Events.
