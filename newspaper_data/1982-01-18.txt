When Ramon R uiz, a 
candidate for Third College 
Provo t, was a ked last week 
about the on-going provost 
sea rch , he replied : 

" I ju t hope the proce s i 
open and honest." 

Rui z'. concern - like that of 
the other three provost 
candidate - is that the 
s arch proce s may be mere 
WIndow-dressing for a 
d cis Ion which high level 
t SD administrators have 
aIr adv made. 

"The search committee 
(system) allow a lot of 
Indi\'idual' to seemingly 
parti ipate in giving input to 
the process," ay A 
President Jule Bagneris, "yet 
usually a deci ion ha already 
been made .... That ha been 
noted in the Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affai rs search 
process (last year) .... And we 
have no reason to believe there 
hasn't already been a decision 
made for the Third College 
Provo t position." 

Acting P rovost Solis 
While no o ne in the 

admini tration has come out 
publically in favor of any on 
of the four candidates, 
Richardo Rao, a member of the 
A Committee for Provos t 

election, feel s that the 
admini t rative staff at Third 
College strongly upport the 
appointment of Acting Provo t 
Fau tIna oli to the 
permanent provo t po ition. 

" he' got expo ure to the 
Third College Dean 's taff, 
and the staff had an 
overwhelming respons to 

very a peet of (her presence 
on Third College)," Rao aid. 

"We'd always like to think 
that whomever will be chosen 
would be cho en because they 
(the committee) feel this is the 
per on who wou Id be 
benefi ial to Third College," 
Ruth Dougherty Assistant 
Administrator to Third 
College Dean Beverly Varga 
said . 

"Sin e Faustina (Solis) has 
been with us, there have been 
very definite, positive feelings 
because of her extreme 
hone ty and her extreme 
willingne to really give it all 
she 's got. She's very hones t 
with people," Dougherty said. 

" I couldn 't ay there would 
be an uproar (if Solis wa not 
appointed permanently). We 
would aU feel a little bit ad 
sImpl y be ause of the fact that 
the hort time she' been here, 
we've seen that she 'd really do 
well (as provost)." Dougherty 
added. 

However, Reggie Williams, 
Commissioner of tudent 
Welfare, doubted whether the 
opinions of s tudents or s tdff at 
Third College would b 

Univer ity of California, an Otego/ Volume 45, Number 5 / Monday, January 18, 1982 

road t 

considered in making the final 
deci ion: "The Chancellor 
search proces , (for example), 
which brought Atkin on to 
this campus, didn 't take any 
meaningful tudent input into 
consideration , and that carrie 
over to any administrative 
. earrh proce<.;s," Williams 
aid. 
Apathy 
But a que. tion whIch 

undermine any committee' 
atlempt to seek out student 
opinion i : do ·tudenL even 
care which candidate i . cho en 
for provo t - or for any 
administrative position, fo r 
that matter. 

"Some s tudent care very, 
much and jus tifiably so,' 
commented one high ranking 
UCSD official. "And many 
s tudents do not care. How 
many tudents vote in an AS 
election? .. And not all those 
students care about the level of 
student participation in the 
choice of admini s trative 
officer ." 

The low levels of student 
turn-out at las t week' provos t 
forum s eem to confirm this 
admini strator's concern . On 
the average, no more than ix 
people attended, and of tho e 
ix , two or three were usually 

Guardian or new indicator 
reporters. 

Ruiz 
"If ther 's a spark on this 

campu ', it 's probably on Third 
College. But r don 't ee much 
spark ," ay candidate Ramon 
Rui z. " It 's a con ervative 
campu. in a con ervative area 
of an Diego." 

Ruiz, a hi tory profes or and 
a pa ·t Chairman of the History 
Department , d lineated hi 

plan for the Third College 
Provo t po ition at last 
Monday's forum. 

The following were some 
que tions po ed to Ruiz: 

The Third Col/ege PrOl'ost 
has few formal powers. What 
lelJerage could you u e as provo t 
to effect chan 01/ Third 
College? 

"You're not going to do 
anything with this college to 
make it move ahead unle s you 
get a faculty member WIth a 
great deal of academic 
pre. tige. How succe' ful are 
you at getting to the chancellor 
depends on the kind of 
authority or prestige you carry 
with you." 

Often, after an administrator 
is appointed to a position, he 
becomes a bureaucrat rather 
than a leader. How can you 
convince us that you would be 
other than a bureaucrat? 

"If this were a managerial 
job, I couldn 't be the least bi t 
intere ted. Look into my 
record (as a profe or and 
Chairman of Hi tory) . Talk to 
(history profe sor) Michael 
Parrish. And you'll find that I 
have trong upporter and 
also strong enemie. One 
rea on i becau e I've done 
some things around here .... 
Affirmati ve Acti on ... Third 
College hi tory cour. e . (Note: 
Rui z al 0 take' credit for 
bringing the large t number of 
minority faculty member into 
the Hi tory Department). 

Do you feeltha t Til i rd College 
has achieved the goals on which 
it wasfounded twenty years ago? 

" The mi .. ion of this college 
has been dormant for orne 
time. Thi doesn 't m an I'm a 
critic of (former Provost) Joe 

hirdp 

Watson. He had a very difficult 
time in making thi college 
urvive." 

Do you upport sororities and 
fraternities? 

''I'm ab olutely oppo ed to 
any kind of old-fa hioned 
sorority or fraternity . ystem 
thal discnmtnates on the ba<,ls 
of color, religion, <:>r race." 

a'hat is vour adl'icc to 
incoming CJiicallo or Black 
studel1ts.' Do VOIl ndl'isc them to 
take Third- World histon' 
cla 'e or to take classcs u'hie/l 
help il1 getting ahead il1 the job 
market? 

"We not only have to be 
peciali t (as tudents), but 

we also have to think for 
our elves, and that require 
grounding in hi tory, 
literature, and some of tho e 
so-called intellectual di ci-
pline that may not make you a 
millionaire. And 1 want the e 
(liberal art ) requirement 
stay. 

"Chicano kid ought to have 
the option to choose. I'm not 
going to tell them that if they 
don't take chemi · try or 
physics that there i' no place 
for them in this world. We 
n eed writer ' . We need 
novel L L . We need poet, 
hi storians, andocial 
scient! ts." 

How u'ould you go about

Cocaine: big business 
One of the rings is known 

as the "Veggie Group," 
because its members own a 
string of vegetarian restau · 
rants on both coasts. Another 
is called the " Remodelers," 
after the series of houses it has 
restored in an eastern city. 
Even when the rings have no 
name, however, they are 
quietly recognized by the bars, 
the clubs, the boutiques, the 
apartment buildings and the 
co nd ominiums they have 
established from the profits of 
their trade. 

They are, in the words of one 
of their clients, the New Age 
S y ndi ca te s - an ever· 
broadening network of middle· 
c la s " co llege · educated. 
financially savvy cocai n e 
dealer whose annual gros ' 
sa les have been estimated as 
larger than those of all but the 
seven larges t corporations on 
the Fortune 500 chart . 

Federal narcotics agen ts 
have acknowledged for some 
time that the cocaine traffic by 
far is the most profitable drug 
trade in America , well above 
heroin. Acccrding to the US 
Drug Enforcement Admini · 
s tration , some 50 metric tons 
of coca ine were imported into 
the United States last yea r , 
with ·treet sales as high as $35 
billion. 

Unlike heroin. which i~ 
largely a drug of escape and 
psychic relief among the ~oor, 
who mu s t steal to support 
their habits , cocaine is the 
elixir of the upwardly mobile. 
A a re ult, its proliferation 
has brought into being a whole 
new layer of entrepreneu ria l 
speculators which did not 
exist even a decade ago. 

" We're the true capitalists," 

Letter to the Editor 

argued Rick , a moderate coke 
dealer who owns his own loft 
in Manhattan . "We operate a 
pure market system, like the 
black market in Russia. There 
is no law but the law of supply 
and demand, no tax law. no 
quality control." 

Many of Rick 's friend use 
the drug trade to gather 
enough capital to start 
legitimate bu ine ses . One, he 
said , had opened a chai n of 
hair salons on the East Coast. 
Others inves t in high· yield 
paper - Treasury notes or 
even Mexican Pemex bonds 
paying 20 percent interes t. But 
real estate often is an easier 
inve tmen!. 

" Firs t you buy false tax 
form - remember, there's 
nothing that 's not for sale. 
With the phony tax records 
you can then go to a bank and 
take out a regular mortgage 
and purchase a run·down 
building. Then you use your 
coke cash 10 turn it into a 
palace. You pay cash to the 
carpenters, the plumbers, the 
electrical contractors, You can 
even buy the fixtures hot 
(stolen ) and at the same time 
bu y inflated receipts to 
account for m a t erials. 
Everybody loves it because 
there are no real record s and 
no taxes. 

"There's an old, East Coast 
city where a bunch of us are 
buying up old houses. We have 
between lOand 15sofar-and 
that 's just our gang. There are 
a t least 10 different group~ 
working in th e sa m e 
town ... that's probabl y 100 to 
150 houses being remodeled . 
We're keeping a lot of people in 
work."

A Different Angle 

A revised weather report 
for America's_finest city 

By JOE FALLETTA 
There's a Tee shirt floating somewhere 

around San Diego that seems to sum up pretty 
well the si tuation in this part of the country. It 
reads, "Ho Hum, another day in paradise. " 

And so it goes . A we run marathons, wash 
our cars and otherwi e bask in the relatively 
balmy weather, most of the rest of the country 
is literally freezing to death. Some of the 
Chargers returned from Cincinnati needing 
treatment for frost bite. 

Oh, ure, we had our rain a few weeks ago and 
some pretty oupy fog around the holidays but 
nothing that really stands up against chill 
factor of 100 degrees. 

You'll notice, however , the rub come when 
televi sion news broadcasts San Diego's 
weather for a ll to see and hear about nation· 
wide. People in Minnesota , Chicago, Cincinnati 
Buffalo right now are telling their familie . 
"Gee, let's move to Sa n Diego, dear ." 

All of which prompted my friend, Pfings ten , 
the other day. to remark, " Hey, what we really 
need to do to keep San Diego from becoming 
another sprawling megalopolis like Los Angeles 
is to broadcas t fake weather reports. Well, it 
ounded good. I can see it now .... 

"Good afternoon, thi s i Michael Tuck w ith 

Problems would arise, though , as security 
would have to be tightened and resident 
screened for family ties to the east. All would 
have to sign loyalty oaths s tating they would 
never divu lge the true nature of the climate 
here in America's Finest City , San Diego would 
become a closed environment as no news 
personnel would be allowed in to view the true 
scene. And what of Dan Rather and "60 
Minutes?" 

Mail censors wou ld be revived to snip out all 
news concerning the climate from letter ' bound 
to families and loved ones east. And soon a 
thought police would be initiated . San Diego 
wou ld take on all appearances of a George 
Orwell novel. 

Pfings ten's jaw slackened as his eyes 10 t 
their twinkle and his smile became lost in a 
frown. The situation had , indeed , grown out of 
control. His gloom proved short ·li ved, t hough, 
as he s tood up and smiled . 

" Hey, c'mon. We s till ha ve a half·hour left for 
lunch . Let's go out and get a tan and throw the 
old football around ." 

Joe Fallella is a slaff u'riler for Ihe Science seel io II of 
Ihe UCSD Guardial/ . 

tonight's news. Residents of Clairemont were ,-________________ ---, 
shocked today when a frea k snows torm 
ra \'aged the area around Fed Mart at Balboa 
near Genessee. Shoppers found themselves 
stra nded in their cars for up to 10 hours as 
snowplow had to be moved in from Big Bear 
and Bi shop. We'll have film at II." 

And in the San Diego Union/ Tribune .... 
"Schools will be closed again today, thi the 

t wenty·firs t consecutive da y of heavy s now 
which blanketed areas of San Diego County 
from Chula Vis ta to Del Mar." 

Of course, the networks and news services 
would pick all this up and our Minnesota family 
would in tead opt for Miami .

Leftist criticism of Reagan shows ignorance 
Editor 

Recentl y. Ronald Reagan 
has undergone severe 
criticism for allegedly 
"pas ing on" execu t ive 
responsibility. for sUPpolledl y, 
being a "mental lightweight ' 
and even for such menial trivia 
as achieving low grades in 
college. Preoccupation uch a 
thi only exemplifie the 
weakness of the frus trated 
radical sect . A late issue of the 

ew Indicator contained an 
advertisement entitled 
"Un 'eat the Cowboy" and 
exhibited a drawing of Ronald 
Reagan atop a nuclear bomb. 
The piece appears to be an 
attempt to re ruit warrior'i 

from the commu ni ty for the 
battle against Preside nt 
Reagan , an a rm s buildup , the 
destruction of the socia l 
welfare state (of which, in 
many ca~es, member of the 
left are solid recipients), and 
the country in generaL Reagan 
is often mentioned as an evil 
fo rce in s e ve ral places 
throughout the issue. 

rt is unfortunate that there 
exists such aversion to a 
country as great as this one. 
Wake up - this is the land of 
the free, not of the oppres'ed. 
True, I can fore ee problems 
with the administrcHion 's 
policies, on t he other hand , I 
would not care to experienc 

the nightmare of a choice of 
t he New Illdicator occupying 
1600 Pennsy lvania Ave. I do 
not wish to present myself as a 
moralizer. Ins tead, I wou ld 
like to point out that radicals 
have mis led and mis repre' 
sented the UC D community 
long enough . 

Reaganism has become a 
sy nonym for savaging the 
socia l budget , for collosal 
boosts in mil itary s pending 
and for tax rate reduc tions for 
the rich. Assertions s uch as, 
" Reagan has shredded the 
socia I safet y net" and is 
"balancing the budget on the 
backs of th poor" represent 

th e misinformed commu nit y. 
fn 1964 , 28.8% of the annual 

Federal Rudget , amounting to 
$34 billion, comprised LBj's 
Great Society devoted to 
"human services." Today t he 
s pending for human resources 
amou nts to 53.3% or $349 
billion , annually. Did the 
Reagan ad ministration throw 
"into reverse" a "genera tion of 
growth in social service 
programs?" Hardly . Not on ly 
all the FDR. but almost all the 
LBJ social programs continue 
to endure and grow. 

As for the "massive" 
military buildup, the Reagan 
adminis tr at io n actually 

presided over a s ignificant 
reduction in st rategic nuclear 
weapons on a lert as well as in 
the development of new 
weapon for the future . Walter 
Pincus, a military analy t for 
the Washington Post, aid that 
"if a Democrat were in the 
White House , conservative 

~ epublicans would be 
accus ing him of unilateral 
disa rmament." Advocates of 
the extreme left in this 
community tread the thin ice 
of ignoranc . tudents of 
lJC [) s hould beware. The 
radical movement is one of 
ideologica l weakness, but it is 
ve ry loud . Don ' t be mis led .

Cocaine is America's eighth largest business 
l'Oll lilllll'd Inlll1 pagt' :.! 

Rick claims that Mafia 
synd icates seldom are directly 
involved in the coke and 
marijuana taffic except as 
financial lenders to the big 
Colombian and Cuban 
wholesalers, or perhaps in 
taking a cut for use of boat , 
barges and trucks. 

" It's so disorganized that 
everybody 's doing it. 
Hou ewives are dealing on the 
side. The cops ju t busted an 
82·year·old grandmother for 
dealing. Even if the mob 
wanted into the trade, how 
would they deal with an 82· 
year·old grandmother?" 

Michael Metzger. a former 

Glen and Shearer 

federal pro ecutor in New 
York who now is one of the 
nation's leading dru& defense 
attorneys, agreed . ' [t 's an 
entirely new set of people in 
the cocaine trade. They' re far 
more diversified than 
marijuana dea lers, or even the 
old mob heroin dealers. These 
are airline pilots, shipping 
executives, manufacturers. 
And the money goes into the 
economy a lot quicker than 
before because these people 
themselves are already 
established. " 

Typical is the ca'e of a 
Seattle water ki manufac· 
ture r , Herb O'Brien , who was 
sentenced to 10 years in 

federal prison for packing 
cocaine into hollow pockets 
within his companyu's skis. 
O'Brien's company apparentl y 
wa highly profitable but 
ready for a major expansion . 
Although the coke trade 
seemed a rea sonable way to 
rai se the necess ary cash , 
unfortunately O'Brien walked 
into the arms of a federa l 
narcotics agent in s tead of a 
bonafide drug dealer. 

Said Metzger, who st ill i 
working on a related case, 
"Here wa a man whowasn't a 
long·haired , dope· moking 
hippy - a married man and 
father . the owner of a big 
business, the ort who by all 

outs ide criter ia could be 
pointed to as a model of 
reo peetable American s uccess. 
And that's the way it usually 
is.li 

Notwith s tandin g that 
apparent respectability, in 
Metzger 's view coke dealers 
are the "scum of the drug 
trade. I've never met a coke 
dea ler worth a s--l. They are 
people who tend to use their 
own product. and as a result 
they tend to be rea II v 'icrewed · 
up People." . 

Yet in college a nd resort 
towns like Ann Arbor, ,\1lch ., 
Boulder and Aspen , Colo.: and 

anta Fe, N.M.: in the idyllic 
villages of the Poconos or of 

Mendocino, Calif., cocai ne and 
marijuana profits also have 
become mainstays of the local 
economy. 

"Track down the money 
behind the boom in chic 
French restaurants here and 
the trail is du ted with white 
powder," said one former 

. re t aura nt operator from 
Santa Fe. 

''I' ll tell you T'm not 
exaggerating when I say t hat a 
third of the live music and 

~i ngles bars that opened in 
Aust in 111 the middle '70s were 
either started with drug 
profits or laundered drug 
money," said a former staffer

Reagan breaks campaign promise on draft 
Aftertoastingthe ewYear 

in luxurious Palm Springs, 
Ronald Reagan finished the 
first week of 1982 with a 
reminder to young people that 
"we live in a dangerous 
wor ld ." 

Duly enlightened, roughly 2 
million 18 year·old men will be 
legally bound this year to 
register with the Selective 

ervice System for a possible 
military draft. 

"rn the event of a future 
threat to national afety," 
Pres ident Reagan told the 
nation Jan , 7. "regi Iration 
cou ld save the Unites States as 
much as s ix weeks in 
mobilizing emergency man · 
power." 

While Reagan' s claims may 

yet prove innacurate. it 
appears that his political 
advisers accurately calculated 
that continui ng a program he 
once opposed would not ignite 
serious public opposi tion. 

Approximately 800,000 
young men have failed to 
regist r· ince Jimm y Carter 
initia ted the program in 
February, 1980. But orga nized 
resistance has refleet ed the 
nat ion's own inertia over 
p eace tim e regi st r a tion .

Reagan' s announcement, the 
Wa hington·ba ed Commitlee

UC budget shows results of lobbying 
University sees overall boost in budget, but still short of inflation rate 

By HENRY SCHULMAN 
acrBmcnlO Correspondent 

When the UC Regents 
presen ted its budget request 
for fisca l year 1982·83, many 
university administrators 
coined the term "wish Ii t" to 
de crib the proposal. Given 
Governor Brown's woeful 
a. essment of the state's 
revenue forecasts, the $92.5 
million increa e the university 
reque ted from the state 
seemed unlikely. 

Brown had already imposed 
a two percent mid ·year 
unanticipated cut on the 
university, and had asked all 
state agencies to prepare for a 
five percent reduction for next 
year. 

niversit y and student 
lobbyists mounted a widescale 
campaign to convince Brown 
that a five percent cut would 

devastate the univer . ity , 
predict ing cuts in classroom 
and student·related area~. But 
lobbyi ts could only assume a 
"hope for the be t. expect the 
worst" attitude. 

Considering the rest of 
Brown's proposed budge' 
they got the best. 

The budget. relea sed at a 
press briefing Friday , shows 
that the university would 
recei ve a total revenue boost of 
$51.9 million. Virtually every 
line item in the university's 
budget would be increased. 
with $29 million specifically 
being cut in administrative 
area. 

But the increa e -till falls 
far hort of the inflaton rate, 
and the univer ity would have 
to prepare for a 2.5 percent 10 
of spending power. compared 
""ith 5 percent suggested for 
other state agencies. 

The $51 million increase 

would be spent mo:-.lIy ,m line· 
item incremental b()()~t s. But 
S8 million of that is 
con picuously planned for 
Brown's pet project. mereased 
education in t he ~ciences and 
technology. 

At la t Friday's briefing h 
<Igaill alluded to his concerns 
that Californian be trained in 
high ·tech fields which he says 
will lead our economy in the 
decades to come. . 

"We must increa -e ~upport 
at the University of alifornia 
and college lev I for 
engineering. computer cience 
and related science m truc· 
tion,'" Brown repeated 
defensively. 

And the governor has reason 
to be defensive. tate Senator 
Alan Robbms, D·Van Nuvs, 
termed the governor' s high·

AS notetaking service begins; 
hopes to boost retention 

BY MAR IA C. MORA 
Henry Chu, Commisionerof 

Academic Affair , ha s 
initiated a lecture note series 
thi quarter which he hopes 
will help student in their 
studies. 

This service. which is 
sponsored by the ASU SD 
and managed by Chu. pays 
notetakers to cover the 
lectures of five of llCSD's 
1I10st popular undergraduate 
classes. 

The lecture notes are sold on 
a weekly subscription basis in 
\\ hich st udents recei ve a 
member 'hip card at the time 
of their purchase. Subscrip· 
tions for the series can be 
bought at any time during the 
quarter for 7. 

The AS has set up 
guidelines for the notetaker , 
among these are that the note 
must be written conci ely and 
in complete sentences. Mo t 
importantly. Chu says , "They 
are not personal notes (for 
noteta kers' per onal use) ." 

Profe ors mClY choose to 
review the note. to be sure of 
their accuracy before they are 
printed. And. as Chu "tate", 
"ASlICSD does not guarantee 
100 percent accuracy in their 
notes." 

Professors also ha\'e I he 
option of recei\'ing a 50c per 
subscription royalty from the 
printing of the notes. Although 
no professor asked to receive 
the royalties. the price of the 
subscription would have gone 

up by 5()¢ per subscription had 
one chosen to. 

The lecture note serie~ is a 
non·profit en' ice. The 
proceeds go toward paying the 
costs of the program. such as 
the wages of the notetakers. If 
there should be any remaining 
profit -. the money will go to 
the A for student acti,ities. 

The initiation of the 
notetaking service here at 
UC D stemmed from Chu's 
having gone to U LA for a 

ummer se ion and his 
having observed the :en'ice's 
success there. U LA and ( C 
Berkeley have had this ~en'ice 
for approximately 25 years. 
and it has proved to be \'ery 
successful, Chu say,.

Singing scientist brings stniles to all 
"/ don't see how anyone could not like Sam 

Hin/ott, " 
By JOE FALLETA 

The remark came from an observer at a rec nt 
performance by Hinton at Drow y Maggie's in North 
Park. Part icipant is probably a better word than 
ob erver as each member of the audience found him 
and herse lf drawn into the music and camaraderie 
Hinton abl y weaves through his wit and sing and 
clap-a longs. By the time the night was done, each 
was lef t with a smile drawn from both the folk mus ic 
as well as the rapport Hinton developed earl y and 
nurtured through the last number, 

Meeting Sam Hinton, folksinger , marine biologist 
and warm , likeable human being of man y talents 
and interests. leaves one with the same feeling of, " 1 
don't see how anyone could not like Sam Hinton." 
What began in thi s ",ase as a newspaper interview 
ended with the feeling that one cou ld pend a day 
talking and playing music with the man and , while 
only scratching the surface. begin a very rewarding 
friendship. 

Hinton retired in 1980 after 36 year with UC an 
Diego - 20 a director of the aquarium and museum 
at Scripps [n titute of Oceanography ~ nd ]6 as 
director of relations with school , He stili teaches 
c1as es in folklore and marine biology for the UC 
Extension and Revelle College and write and 
illu trate a weekly column on marine life for the 
San Diego Union. He i are earch assoc iate for the 
UC LA Center for Folklore and Mythology and , a a 
consu ltant for the gifted with the San Diego City 

chao I District, he bring the lore and ong of the 
pa t to primary and secondary chaol tudents. 

"Folk song how us the relation of individuals to 
history and teach u that folk then were the arne 
a they are now," Hinton ays. "They give us an 

Sam Hinlon 
understanding whether the topic i lit erature or 
history ." 

An author of more than 20 books and articles on 
folklore and marine biology, Hinton says hi s interest 
in animal and plant life extends a far back In his 
yout h a doe hi s music; and that , to when he was a 

your,~ster of about five or so. 
" It s just something 1 always wanted to do:' he 

admits. 
He worked during the depre ·sion as a reptile 

collector and scientific Illustrator while studymg 
zoology at Texas A & M University, The summer of 
1935 aw him -tud ying the fauna and flora of 
Walker Cou nt y, Texa ·, as a junior biologist. He 
directed the Palm Springs De ert Museum after his 
graduation from UCLA in 194 1. worked as a ci ,'i li<ln 

lab technician in para itology and hematology for 
the Arm y's Torney General Hospita l in Palm 

prings, and was an editor and illustrator for what 
is now the Navy Electronics Lab before comll1g to 
Scripps in 1946. 

He has taught aboUtlhe life and land of the coastal 
plainS, 'ou thern California. Baja California , and the 
migrat ion of the Grey Whale.., in a variety of settings 
ranging from sh ipboard journey to c1assf(xlm<;. field 
trip", radIO, television and cassette tape.... He 
lectured on manne sCience" for the L'nl\er"lt) of 
Maryland on board a cruise ship. 

"In the da~ . I'd lecture and at night I'd "ll1g folk 
songs. We drew a pretty good group of peuple," he 
says. 

Hin ton was appointed director of relatIOns" Ith

~~STUDENTS - FACULTY - STAFF~~ 
In the past few years, the University of 

California has moved toward greater 
assignment of responsibilities to campuses for 
the operation of University programs on the 
presumption that those closest to the programs 
are best able to resolve issuesarising from their 
operation. The President and Systemwide 
Administration are responsible for policy and for 
assuring The Regents and the public that all 
programs and activities are appropriately 
supported and reviewed. 

To strengthen the foundations af the 
stewardship of campuses, the President in 1979 
appointed three advisory committees to visit 
the campuses and report to him regularly on 
the state of the campuses. 

On February 11 -12, Campus Advisory 
Committee "C" will visit UCSD. If you would be 
interested in meeting with this committee, then

Paper as a tnediufll in 
ne\V exhibit at museutn 

By DAVID FLAUM 
A newly organized collection 

of contemporary art , New 
Works on Paper I, arrived 
recently from New York at the 
Lalolla Museum of Contempo-
rary Art. The exhibition 
combines the various efforts of 
eight popular arti s ts and their 
works on paper. Organized by 
John Elderfield. Director of 
Drawings at the Museum of 
Modern Art , this collection of 
ninety works provides a rich 
look into current arti stic 
trend s. 

Except that each artist i in 
hi s or her late-thirtie mid -
forties, the eight artists do not 
profes to share any particular 
style. In fact , their tyles of 
imagery range from reali ·t 
vi"ions to collages. What these 
arti IS do share. however, is an 
mnovatlve approach towards 
lraditio n al art styles, 
exemplified In this exhibit's 
unusual use of paper. Th 
l'lght artist' are: Jake Berthot, 
Dan Christensen, Alan Cote. 
Tom Holland. Y\'onne 
]acquette. Ken Kif!. Joan 
!::lnyd r and William Tucker. 

The artist 's experience of 
mind a nd ob erva tion 
underlies the imagery of Kiff' s 
and lacq uette's works. Kiff' s 
use of vivid watercolor and 
di storted figu~e creates ome 

mythical c haracter s in 
primitive backgrounds. 
Perhaps Kiff draws on his own 
experience with psychoanaly-
sis to produce these and other 
subjects_ In a large acrylic 
entitled "Talking with a 
Psychoanalyst: Night Sky," he 
illuminates the uncon ciou in 
a cIa sic co nfrontati o n 
between doctor and patient. 

If Kiff' s works see m 
expressioni tic, ]acquette's 

aerial observations of 
nocturnal New York City 
appear impre s ioni tic by 
comparison. Building upon the 
natural patters of bridges and 
city lamps, she composes the 
foundation of her charcoal 
drawing. Parti cular focus then 
on spa tial balance and 
composite framing heightens 
the perspective of her photo-
like images_ Looking at her

Aztecs take a dive and \\Tin 
Triton men outswim SDSU, but lose on board 

BY BILL FISH 
Staff Write r 

The final score on the board 
read San Diego State, 59 -
UCS D, 45. Was Triton 's 
Coach Bill Morgan disappoi n· 
ted by the performance of his 
men 's swim team? "Ab olute· 
Iy not. " 

The score, as the coach is 
quick to point out, was 
deceiving at las t Saturday 
night' home meet. The Aztecs 
are a Divi ion I squad , the 
Tritons are Divis ion III. (The 
Trit o n c an ' t re s ist a 
cha lIenge), 

Other deciding differences 
include UCSD's lack of divers. 
The squad is equipped with 
only one. In the divi ng portion 
of thi mee t SDSU notched an 
easy 16 ~oints to their 
oppone nt s two . Scratch 
diving from the score, and a 
wide grin come to Morgan" 
face, "Diving i alway a 
problem," he admit, "but 

when it comes down to 
swi mming, we won this one." 

Some brilliant recorded 
t imes by his squad prov the 
coac h correct. Dave Higdon 
clocked a 10: 16.3 for a fir t 
place fini sh in th e 1000 Free. 
Oth er Triton wi nn ers 
included Greg Doyas, a 1:47.l7 
in the 200 Free, sw imming 
neck·and ·neck with a n Aztec 
in perhaps the closest race of 
the night,Jon Irwin , a 2:03.4 in 
the 200 Individual Medley, 
Tracy Strahl in the 200 
backstroke, and Pete Achoff, a 
48.4 split in the400 Free Relay, 

Potential AII ·American 
Irwi n continues to chop time 
off his marks. He was onl y 
three seconds away from 
qualifying time for Nationals 
in the 200 1M, 

The coach st resses mental 
preparation almost as much as 
physical preparation. Prece· 
ding this meet , his team went 

ou t to dinner, then spent "at 
least an hour prepa rin g 
mentally." 

Their mi ' leading record 
now tandsat 1·3 (two of these 
losses against SDSU), the 
Tritons face a chedule in the 
next month which may be 
even tougher than what 
they've faced thu far. Their 
next con test is this Friday 
night whe n they ho s t 
Claremont Mudd , in a dual 
meet, which Morga n is proud 
to announce will be featured in 
the magazine, Swimming

Are UCSD sports entering a "golden age ?" 
By LARRY GOLDMAN 

S iaff Writ e r 
Participation in the 

program of the Recreation 
department, especial ly in 
intra murals, has skyrocketed. 
The increa e has put qui t a 
st rain on the facilitie at 
UCSD and if participation 
continues to increase and the 
faci li ties are not expanded, 
there wi ll be major problems. 

As it s tands now, the 
int ramural department has 
had to turn down many 
basketball and floor hockey 
team s because of a lack of gym 
space, Pool time is so tight, 
especially w hen there is 1M 
waterpolo, that the amount of 
free swim time offered is much 
less than optimal. Field s pace 
is adequate but the quality of 
the fields is not.

When compel ing against

And you thought football season was over! Wild 1M Hawaiian has started for those who like 
basketball, soccer, and football at the same time. 

Rec seeks ntillion for pool 
l'ont inued from pa~e ) 7 
ba ' ketball or soccer game 
have found that the organized 
aspects of the Rec depart ment 
have left little time for such 
activities. 

This is a problem since the 
goal of the Recreation 
department. which consists of 
intramural s, rec club, 
outdoor recreation, recclasses, 
Mi ion Bay Aquatic, and open 
recreation , i to get as many 
people parti c ipating as 
possible. Since upen rec users 
are many thi goal is being 
defeated. 

Why are facilities so 
cramped? The main rea on 
seem to stem from the early 
philo ophy of UCSD. Back 
when student voted not to 
have scholarships, according 
to Hipp, the whole program 

was hurt becau e all athletics 
were given a no confidence 
vote. Now that attitudes have 
changed and the Recreation 
department is popular the 
facility ituation must catch 
up. 

New faci li ties have been 
built or are being built at UC 
Davis, UC anta Barbara. and 
UCLA. Becau e CSD is such 
a young chool it is taking time 
to improve what it has now. 
One person who has high 
hope and big plans for 
facilitie at UCSD i · the 
director of the Rec depart· 
ment . Bert Kobaya hi . 

Last Spring student voted 
to fund a new pool facility. The 
facility as it stands now will 
include a 25 meter 0001, 5 
racquetball court and' locker 
room s. It will be located on 

Warren ca mpus between 
Pryatel and Warren West 
fields. But as Kobayashi 
states, "that is just the base 
unit. There is a plan for a 50 
meter pool as an alternative." 
The fees students voted for 
only provide for a 25 meter pool 
but Kobayashi has been very 
active in obtaining community 
support via fund raising and 
expects to get at least enough 
money for the 50 meter pool. 

Construction bids go out in 
F bruarv and once received 
the Uni\"er it y has 90 day to 
accept one. Koba yashi said the 
fund raisi ng will be a two 
phase proces. . " We need 
$ 00.000 for the 50 meter pool 
by ground breaking (estimated 
to be June 1 st) and then we 
must work ongettingtheother

score was 45·18 at half-time. San Diego was led by Tom Wight

The Tritons, 6·8, play Point Lorna at home this Tuesday. 7:30

and Wendy Freed led the fa t-breakingTritons with a totalof31 
points as the team opened league play with a convincing win. 
Center Mary Egan had 13 rebounds for the Tritons. Against 
Division II Loyola UCSD was not so lucky. San Diego's sea on 
record dropped to 4-11 de pite a 20 point effort by Wendy Freed 
and a 17 point, 7 rebound night by Mary Egan. Paulette Parker

The pool designer who 

de igned the U C olympic pool 
has b en hired by UCSD. rf t he 
50 meter pool is built it will be 
the only 50 meter faci lit y in the 
city of San Diego. 

If all goes well cons t ruction 
is expected to take 12 months 
and the complex is scheduled 
to open in the ummer of 1983 
and for sure, "no later than 
faIL" 

Kobayashi doesn't on ly have 
high hopes for the pool 

situation . He feel UCSD will 
have another gym within 5 
year s. The gym will be built 
right next to t he new pool. 
According to Kobayashi the 
key to getting a new gym is 
community in volvement. He 
said" " We mu t get our foot in 
the door and get the 
community involved ." When 
thi s happens funds will be 
rai sed and Kobayashi's hopes 
may be realized . At least for 
now the chance for UC 0 
~etting a 50 meter pool is, 
'very realistic."

UCSD recruiting 
continued from pag 17 
high school coaches around 
here know me. As a result, 
they refer manx of their good 
athlete to me. ' Dudash took 
the talent he has recruited to 
a 6-0 league record and the 
league championship la st 
year. 

Volleyball coac h Doug 
Dannevik has also had great 
successs luring athlete to 
UCSD. He has acquired a 
reputation for being a 
successful as well as a caring 
coach. This reputation ha ' 
helped him recruit the talent 
he now has on both his team. 
For example, he got former 
Div . I player Marilyn Horn 
and Tammy Smit to tran fer 
here. and they contributed to a 
women' team that won the 
National Champion hip this 
season. The trophy itself 
shou Id bring more attentiL to 
UCSD and help to attract 
ot her quality athlete. 

Men's basketball coach John 
Block , hired two days before 
the start of the 1980 season, 
ha "as good a recruiting year 
as any coach cou ld want" in 
hi first recruiting .eason. 
With only one returning 
player he ha. brough t toget her 
a good team featuring a tall 
front line and good·shooting 
guards. He has great hope for 
getting both a 7' and 6'11" 
pro 'peel ~wn. Block. hi m~elf a 
6'10" pro center who retired in 
1976 after a 10,vear NBA 
career, feels hi background is 
largely responsible for his 
success. "I have perhap 
greater sco pe and more 
visibility than previous 
coaches here," he ays, "and 

as a result I have a lot of 
contacts. That allow me a 
better chance to ee and get 
response from the best player 
around. " 

Denny Harper, coach of the 
water polo team, has also done 
some excellent recruiting. "Its 
not ea y getting the 'blue· 
chipper s'," he ays. That ' 
true. but he's done the job. His 
team went 19-10 in his first 
year , and 18-12-2 again t much 
tougher competition last year. 
For thi coming ea on, he ha 
recruited "a couple of 10's." 
One of them is Bill 
Kazmier owicz. a highly 
recruited athlete who was 
offered a four·year scholar. hip 
to play with perennial water 
polo super-power tanford. 
Incrediblv. he turned it down 
to pIa' 01; Harper's team. 

UC D's coache want not 
just athletes; they want 
student-ath lete . The aca-
demics of the school are 
stressed. and thus on Iv. eriou. 
stude nt s are recruited . 
"Student-athlete" is a term 
that has lost it. original 
meaning elsewhere, but not at 
UC D . 

Recruiting at UC 0 today L 
on a different level than it wa 
a few yea rs ago. Today's 
dedI cated coaches are 
spending great amount of 
time recruiting. and the efforts 
are paying off. The lack of 
athletic . cholar. hips i. a 
hindrance. but UC D's team. 
are competing with - and 
beating - teams afforded the 
luxurv of the. scholarshIps. 
and. 'as one coach puts it. 
"That makes our accomplish· 
ments taste just a little 
sweeter."
