Cleo Malone , Muir College resident dean, has been temporarily 
reassigned to the planning department of University Hospital by 
the Chancellor, McElroy's office announced yesterday. Malone's 
reassignment foHows a recent inquiry by UC San Diego officials, 
which included investigation of allegations against Malone of 
sexual misconduct. 

In addition, the Triton Times has learned of allegations against 
Malone made by former assistant Resident Dean Babs Baker. 
According to sources,Malone was exonerated of these charges.

City Council to Receive 
Coop UTC Position 

by Mark Stadler 
C;ommunity Editor 

Marco LI Mandri has sent a 
letter to the City Council 
represe nting the Student 
Cooperative's opposition to the 
pro po ed Town Centre 
development. LiMandr i, the 
Coop's local external affairs 
coordi nator says the letter wi II 
also be sent to local town 
councils and the news media .-

Five Points 

LIMandri said the letter 
contained five main points of 
oppo ition to the Town Centre 
projec t. First , he said the Town 
Centre will not be a town center 
at all , as it will have major 
d partment stores like Sears that 
wi ll draw people from all over San 
Diego, not from just the local 
drea 

Second , LiMandri said , the 
Town Centre isn't in the center of 
anything, but at least two miles 
from any housing development or 
town . 

Third, Town Centre developf'r 
Ernest Hahn IS ub Idiling 
150,000 feet of th~ developmt'nt 
for community and UOlVt'f Ity 
UW, lor thing, ~uch a tood 
toop, ThiS plan ,LIMandri aid, 

'ollnd~ attractlv(', bUI re.lly I n't , 

because people would be forced 
to use the Town Centre, and not 
oth r areas 

Fourth , there probably won't be 
ufflclent number of people to 

use the Centre . LIMandri said the 
development is based on the 
UCSD Master Plan , which , he 
aid, calls for 27,000 people and 

twelve colleges by 1990. Since 
thl~ J,.lldr! I~ practically Inoperative 
for a number of reasOns, in-
cluding the state of the economy, 
LiMandri believes there won't be 
enough p opl e here to utilize the 
Town Centre to the bt'st ad-
vantage . 

Not Responsive 

Fifth is the argument that the 
Town Centre's residential section 
is not responsive to the needs for 
low incom housing of the 
students and other people . 
LiMandri argues in the letter that 
the money and energies used to 
construct omething like Town 
Centre should Instead be directed 
to revitalizing the city's inner 
core. This argument has been 
used in the past by advocates of 
controlled growth , including 

\ Mavor Pete Wilson . 

LiMandri declared that the 
purpose of the letter is to con-
tinue building a rapport between 
university students and the 
community It IS part of the 
continuing interaction between 
the Coop and the City, LiMandri 
~tated, which has included UCSD 
students attending several City 
Council meetings on issues like 
Town Centre and North City 
W('~t 

fhe letter is also part 01 an 
attempt to build a "cohesive 
oppositional Iront" of com-
munities adverselv affected by

Corrective Action 

examinations to prove testimony 
they had" made against Malone to 
Vice-chancellor for Student 
Affairs George Murphy and Muir 
Provost John Stewart. The two 
administrators headed the 
Inquiry . , 

Reportedly, Malone also 
vol u nteered to take the polygraph 
test, but, because of his health , 
was adVised against It by his 
doctor. 

Sources say that the results of a 
polygraph test supported one of 
the stu dents' allegations . 
Orgi nally five students had made 
charges against Malone, but It 
was found in preliminary studies 
that two were not as seriously 
involved in the matters. 

The statement issued by the 
Chancellor yesterday said , in part, 
" I twas determ i ned by I n-
dependent Investigation that the

Investigatory procedures utilized 
by the Vice-chancellor and the

he IS now reviewing Murphy's and

McElroy also said In hiS 
statement, " In addition , ( I) have 
asked the University 's legal 
cou nsel from Berkeley to review 
the entire matter " 

Corrective action agai nst the 
campaigner might result in in-
validation of election results or 
su pension of campaigning for a 
determ ined number of days .

250 Hear Evangelists at Revelle 
A crowd of two hundred and fifty gathered In Revelle Plaza 

yesterday to hear Hubert Lindsay, Ron Lopez, John Moe, and Raymond 
Chisolm speak on Christianity . The four Itinerant evangelists came to 
UCSD haVing just finished a similar engagement at Cal Poly San LUIS 
Obi po at the invitation of the school 's chapter of Campu s Crusade for 
Christ. Mr Lindsay IS the author of the book " Bless Your Dlrtv Heart," 

Lopez stated th,at all of them have been converted at least seven 
years and that Lindsay has been a preacher since his youth In Alabama 

At the commission 's first 
meeting on Wednesday, April 9, 
the referendum wording was 
finalized . Yet to be decided are 
the locations of the polling 
stat ions and the method for ballot 
tabulation . 

The rather loud and generally mocking response the speakers drew 
is, according to Lopez, typical of their campus appearances around the 
state . Lopez said none of the four were dependent on collectIOns to 
continue their ministry, all having regular employment 

The four evangelists visited Fresno State and Cal Poly before coming 
here . Accordi ng to Lopez , he and the others are invited to a campus bv 
that school 's Campus Crusade for Christ club, though no such In-
vitat ion w'as extended by UCSD's club.

Letters to the Editor CALP); G Investigates 
Nursing Homes in SD 

by 41~n Kremen 
c.l1famIe Pl*1c._ --..:tI Group 

White Reads Lopez Letter Backwards 
The story of what's going on inside our.nation's homes for the aged is 

beginning to be told-and it's an ugly story. Newspapers and 
magazines are documenting a litany of horrors, government in-
vestigations have sprung up in various parts of the country, and 
concerned citizens are asking what they can do to help. 

Here at UCSD, sixteen students have been working since early 
January with CAlPIRC (the California Public Interest Research Group) 
on an investigation of San Diego area nursing homes. Many of us have 
gotten course credit through the Urban and Rural Studies Dept. for the 
project, others have not. Yet all of us have put more hours into this 
study than for any other class that we have taken at UCSD. 

As investigators, we have been inside many of the county's 64 
nursing homes, have talked to patients, social workers, nursing home 
owners, State Health Department inspectors, State legislators and 
many others . 

The cnarges under investigation include inhuman abuse and per-
vasive lack of dignity toward patients by grossly underpaid staff, lax 
government enforcement of standards, doctor .disinterest in elderly 
patients, drug kickbacks and inadequate care. 

CALPIRC's report will be released in early June. The students who 
have worked on the project hope that It will serve to demonstrate that 
students can integrate academic course work with REAl WORLD 
problem solving here at UCSD. Important officials in Sacramento have 
heard about our study and are excited by its potential. We have been 
working closely with State lawmakers in developing CONCRETE 
PROPOSALS to remedy the situation in nursing homes and have 
received offers by several -Assemblymen to introduce the legislation 
that W!! intend to draft. 

What we are doing now as students at UCSD may very possibly result 
in constructive legislation and hopefully an alleviation of some 
gruesomely important problems . There is really a vacuum of people 
working on social problems for the public interest and students 
working through the university can be really effective in filling this 
vacuum. 

We urge students to take a more active role . You can use your 
educational experience to become effective in creating meaningful 
social change. Sign up for 199's, work with groups like CAlPIRG,-get 
involved .. 

We urge faculty to take an important role as well. Direct courses 
which work on finding solutions to societal problems, give 199's to 
students for " relevant" academic work, use your position in the 
University as a tool for social betterment. 

As members of the academic community we rave a responsibility to 
lead in t~e search for answers to problems that threaten to overwhelm 
our society. As members of society we can't afford not to accept that 
responsibility. 

Upon reading Mr. VVhite's letter 
(TT, April 7) in response to my 
own lettE'r, I was seized by an 
overwhelming sensation . It 
appeared to me that Mr White 
had read my letter backwards. In 
his first sentence, Mr. White 
points out that he "extolls the 
virtues of the Coop in helping him 
(myself) to drop out of biology 
and become a politico." It seems 
Mr. White's historical perspective 
is awry, for I changed my major in 
the Spring of 1974, before the 
Coop had ever been imagined. 
For a quarter I had no vehicle to 
observe, and no place to really 
plug into and aid in function . 
Perhaps I should have pOinted 
this chronology out in my letter ; 
the time order was there, but 
there were no dates . At any rate, . 
there was simply no Coop about 
to direct or otherwise affect my 
decision . My decision was based 
on my personal realization thi\t 
""" the academic system at UCSD 
kept people apart. ... " Upon 
returning from Michigan last 
summer (a trip I'm sure many 
people here can relate to) I 
discovered a body called the 
Coop . That is what I was thankful 
for. 

Of course, I really didn't expect 
Mr. White to understand this 
rather opinionated version of 
education and relevance at 
UCsD. But I never expected for 
Mr. White to then proceed to 
attack an issue I had never 
mentioned and use my name as a 
target for that attack . The 
Campus Activity Fee, which Mr. 
White seems to think pays " for 
Mr. Lopez's political dabblings," 

, 

GSA Formed for Communication 
o.v S1ucIema' Aaodrion attending a workshop at UC Los 

Angeles for West Coast Gay 
students organizations and 
planning a non-sexist dance to be 
held later this quarter . 

never enters my hands. Is Mr. 
White insinuating that I get paid 
for my work1 If so, that is untrue; 
but I do not thtnk that to be his 
point Rather, I think that Mr. 
White is trying to S4Y that the 

They knew that only by including 
the Budget/ Resource Croup in 
their model could they keep the 
students wholly in charge of the 
allocation process . It is not the 
case. as Mr . White seems to think, 

'I lNIKK IYESlFN E/bi;H MWI' 

Coop would not exist without the 
Activity Fee, and would disappear 
if the Fee were made voluntary . 
Again I respectfully submit that 
Mr. White's historical perspective 
is awry . The Activity Fee was 
voted in by the students in the 
referendum of the Spring of 1972, 
and both SLiC and TUSC were in 
charge of its allocation . The 
Model Building Committee that 
created the Coop put upon itself 
at the dissolution of TUSC that 
same responsibility for allocation . 

, 

that the Coop exists as a result of 
the Mandatory Activity Fee. 

In closing, I would like to thank 
Mr. White for his comments, so 
swiftly stated, that allowed me a 
chance to enlighten him. I invite 
Mr. White to further comments, 
in the hopes that he will examine 
the facts 'before responding. One 
fact I should note is that Mr 
White is a graduate student, and 
does not pay the Campus Activity 
Fee. 

sTEPH EN LOPEZ 

Montgomery Reed is 'Very Sad' 
I sat out on the plaza Monday to eat lunch as I often do; it is one of 

the few places on the Revelle campus where one is able to see otd 
friends and long-unseen acquaintances from required classes that at 
one time fused each class into a type of amalgam . 

But this Monday was different than most ; there was a fellow in the 
plaza, Montgomery Reed, who, in the name of free speech. was tearing 
the semi-quiet with a PA system . He sat and extolled the virtues of 
" free speech" and " the Coop", perhaps just by his mere presence there 
on the fountain; he is well known . While I listened, another fellow. 
who I have seen before running a projector on campus, was passing 
around a sheet of paper proclaiming " the Coop/ College All Campus 
Dance." It seems to me that this was quite opportunistic and tan-
tamount to attempting to buy the votes in favor of the Coop. All of this

During the fall quarter of this 
year, a series of letters printed in 
the Triton Times depicted the 
absence of an organized means of 
communication available to Gay 
students at UC San Diego, the 
isolation some students felt as a 
result of this absence. These 
letters provided an impetus for 
the fOfllJation of the UCSD Gay 
Students Association (CSA). The 
first meeting, held early in the 
winter quarter, was attended by 
men and women from all four 
campuses and nearly every 
department. Since then , the GSA 
has continued to meet every 
Monday in the Revelle Informal 
lounge at 7 pm. However, future 
meetings will be held in the Blake 
Confere nce lounge . Iss ues 
conside red thus far at the 
meetings have included the Third 
World's interpretation of gay life, 
California sex laws, and the 
problems of police harassment. 

information, counseling and 
morat support, a gay hotline was 
established at the GSA's office in 
the Student Center . The hotline is 
staffed by the association's 
members and may be reached

Concert Scene Thaws 
Out in San Die 

l.arry Coryell . 

by Lilrry Deckel 
Ana Ecltor 

The alle~rd spri ng comes, 
bri nging wit~ it the return of 
concert actiVity to San Diego. 
This week is marked with a 
multitude of shows, primarily in 
the jazz. folk , Country, and 
Gospel veins. 

Tonight at 8:30 pm Merle 
Haggard will make a rare concert 
appearance at Golden Hall . 
Merle's fame comes from his 
country charts , his songs 
reflecting a unique vision of 
America, from one who has really 
known drifting, the country, hard 
times, San Quentin Prison, and all 
the intimaCies of country music . 
Appearing with M rle will be Don 
Bowma n and The Strangers 
featuring Ronny Reno and Leona 
Wil iams 

Saturday night is jazz at its 
fi nest. A dynamite show at 
Golden 'Hall brings together Chick 
Corea & Return to Forever, the 
Eleventh House featuring Larry 
Coryell, and the Charles Lloyd 
Quartet. Chick Corea's and Larry 
Coryell's groups need no in-
troduction to San Diego 
audiences. Both have played to 
packed houses here at UCSD and 
Chick Corea has graced halls all 
over San Diego. The fact that they 
have bo!h returned again is an 
immedia te indica tion of the 
popularity of the two groups. 

Charles L10vd is another of the 
great fusion artists bringing the 
world of avante-garde jazz and 
rock together. The first jazz artist 
to play the Fillmore Auditoriums , 
and first American mUSICIan 
invited by the Soviet Union to 
play behind the Iron Curtain, 
Lloyd is constantly found in 
collaboration with prominent 
rock artists such as the Beach 
Iloys. Robert McCuinn , ana Dave 
Mason, as well as recording his 
own material.

can be accepted in light of the "Watergate mentality" but that IS not 
what prompted me to write. Montgomery Reed sat there and verbally 
attacked someone named James Soto I hardly knolN who soto IS. let 
alone have ever met him. But there was Montgomery Reed , calli ng him 
"a bastard" right out there on the plaza , trying to goad this poor fellow

Sports 

In oors and Out 
by Dave Eisen 

Iporta~ 

With the dailv San Diego downpours raining out <;ome UCSD sports 
events (most recently baseball) , the local fan must turn his thoughts 
indoors. The rai:1 factor seems to be only one of the reasons that World 
Team Tennis, the town's newest league, has a chance to be a success . 

The San Diego entry has been named the Friars, and they will play 
their matches at the Sports Arena. The Friars' failure to sign " name" 
players, notably Rod Laver, has left them with some talented non-
superstars. Vijay Amritrai, ranked number one in India, and Lesley 
Hunt, third in Australia, will be the top male and female si ngles 
players. 

The Friars will have to depend on spectators coming to see other 
teams , an easy venture in the WTT "Spectacular" system. Rather than 
the 22-game home schedule used in the league last season, the Friars 
will be at home for only two weekends, the first being in early May. 

During the weekend, eight WTT teams will participate in the 
spectacu lar in a type of round-robin format. In this way home fans will 
get a chance to watch John Newcombe, Evonne Goolagong, Billie Jean 
King, and others in one weekend of action . 

Los Angeles also has a team, called the Strings, who are still unhappy 
at their inability to sign Chris Evert. Evert, who easily won the Virginia 
Slims Championship in LA last weekend, said she had seriously thought 
at one time about signing with a West Coast WTT quad, meaning the 
Strings, Friars, or Hawaii Leis . 

••••• *** •••••• *** ••• *** ••••••• 

Another local pro team, the Padres, is ready to go, but they' ll have 
to do i in the rain . The Padres' opening battle was scheduled for 
Tuesday night. 

The team will be trying to escape last place for the first time in 
history, and they might have a chance. Veterans like Willie McCovey, 
Glen Beckart, Tito Fuentes, and Bobby Tolan, along with some young 
players (including Dave Winfield) might bring the Padres as high as 
third . 

Their pitching still seems quite poor, but the added bats shou ld at 
least make for some exciting, high-scoring games. 

Final Sign ups Today 
Today is the last day to sign up for this qUilirter's intramural sports. 

Coed innertube waterpolo will have its captains' meeting at 4 p .m. 
followed by men's floor hockey at 5 p.m. and coed floor hockey im-
mediately after at 5:30 p.m. All meetings will be held in the recreation 
gym conference room. Get a team or two together and take a break 
from the studies.
