New drug aids 
premature infants 

Researchers from UCSD and 
Finland have developed an 
experimental drug which, they 
have reponed, improves 
breathing and significantly 
reduces the chance of lung 
disease in premature babies, 
increasing their chances ef 
survival ~ 

The drug, called human lung 
surfactant, is made from 
amniotic fluids. It is used to coat 
thl;. prematurely developed lungs 
of infants so they will function 
more normally. 

A repon in last week's issue of 
the New EnglandJoumal of 
Medicine said the new drug cut 
the death rate of premature 
infants with a high risk of deadly 
lung disease from 51.7 percent to 
16.1 percent 

Despite this promising repon, 
researchers said, more work on 
the drug is needed to confim the 
studies and make sure there are 
no side-effects. Widespread use 
of the surfactant in neonatal care 
units is still several years away. 

Economist Krause joins 
Pacific Rim school 

Lawrence Krause, an 
internationally known Senior 
Fellow economist since 1963 at 
the Brookings Institution, one of 
the country's leading private 
reasearch establishments in 
Washington, D.C., has been 
selected as the first faculty 
member of the new UCSD 
Graduate School of International 
Re.lations and Pacific Studies. 
The "Pacific Rim" graduate 
school was established by the 
UC Regents in January, 1986, as 
the University's first graduate 
professional school of 

BLOOM COUNTY 

international relations and the 
first in the COUntry to specialize 
in the Pacific region. 

Krause , currently a Visiting 
Fellow at the Institute of 
Southeast Asian Srudies, in 
Singapore, will play a leadership 
role in UCSD research on the 
Pacific Basin economy, the 
recruiunent of faculty, and the 
development of curriculum. The 
new school will offer degree 
programs for professionals 
dealing with the Pacific region in 
both the public and private 
sectors, research programs on 
policy issues concerned with the 
Pacific, as weD as public outreach 
programs related to this area. 

Two countries added 
to EAP studies 

The University of California is 
expanding oponunities for 
students to study in Pacific Rim 
countries. The addition of three 
new exchange programs and TWO 
more countries to the roster of 
UCs Education Abroad Program 
(EAP) was approved by the UC 
Regents at their meeting last 
May, at UC San Francisco. 

The Regents agreed to 
establish stUdent exchange 
programs at Sophia University in 
Tokyo,Japan, and Vonsei 
University in Seoul, South Korea, 
beginning in the fall of 1986; 
and the University of Costa Rica 
beginning in January 1988. 

In the academic year 1985~, 
over 800 UC students enrolled in 
54 universities in 24 countries 
speaking 15 different languages. 
In return, almost 200 foreign 
students attended UC through

Cars in I ICSD parking lots are bumper to bum~r. 

Planning to park 
By ERIC CHAZANKIN 

N EW parking areas planned should help alleviate the parking 
problem, and offset the present 
difficulties caused by the inOux 
of new students and construCtion 
on campus. 

New parking for stUdents 
includes the lot south of the 
School of Medicine, a new 128-
space lot near the Supercomputer 
Center, and a number of spaces 
in an overflow lot which were 
previously leased to Scripps 
Institute, 

Approximately 1,500 spaces 
are planned for the near future 
in the area west of the University 
Extension buildin~ along N, 
Torrey Pines Rd, This is in 
addition to Olher, srnaDer 
projects. 

Many spaces in the Mandeville 
Center Parking lot, which have 
been switched from student to 
faculty use, will soon vanish as 
half of that lot disappears to 
make room for the new 
University Center,

According to Parking Office 
Assistant Manager Laura Rey, 
surveys are made on a 
continuing basis to derermine 
parking patterns and spaces 
available, Using this information, 
the office staff may be able to 
pomt out new parking 
alternatives to help students get 
to class on time, 

Rey also "suggests use of 
outlying 00, but cautions that 
those returning to these lots late 
in the day should be concerned 
about safety, and caB for a C.S.O. 
escort if necessary. 

Further comments, complaints 
or suggestions should be directed 
to each college's parking 
representative, who may be 
contacted through the college's 
Commuter Board. 

Tentative plans currently call 
for at least one parking structure 
to be built, possibly around 
where the bookstore is now 
locared. Of course, this could not 
be built until the bookstore is 
relocated in a few years.

Earthquake studies 

Lab researches faults for future foundations 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 

OVER 100,000 buildings in California are In danger of collapsing in a major 
eanhquake, and Dr. Gil 
Hegemier, Director of the 
Charles Lee Powell Srrucrural 
Systems Laboratory, is doing 
something about it. 

The Laboratory, known more 
casually as the eanhquake lab, is 
located on Old Miramar Road 
across from UCSD police station. 

Dedicated in May of this year, 
the two-mill ion-dollar building 
will soon be fitted with another 
twO million dollars' wonh of 
equipment designed "for 
experimental testing of full or 
large-scale structural components 
and systems," 

The initial experiments will 
deal with masonry buildings, 
staning with the walls alone and 
ending with the testing of a full-
scale, five-story building. They 
will be done in concert with the 
Japanese at their slightly larger 
faciliry in Tsukube City. This is 
the third phase of an ongOing 
project with the Japanese that 
has lasted some 15 years, The 
first phase involved the testing of 
steel strucrures, and the second 
phase was concerned with steel-
reinforced concrete buildings, 
Both labs will use the same 
building materials but slightly 

different types of construction 
techniques; they will then 
compare results and attempt to 
iron out any differences. 

"There is an earthquake 
problem that is scaty," Hegemier 
said, and "statistically we're 
(California) going to get zapped." 
He went on to say that, unlike 
the work of many research labs, 
the laboratory's effons would be 
"instantly" applicable to the real 
world. The International 
Conference of Building Officials, 
which creates the Universal 
Building Code, takes its cue from 
members of the Structural 
Engineering Association, some of 
whom work at the Laboratory. 
Therefore, what has been 
experimentally determined here 
at YCSD will be adopted very 
quickly by the worldwide 
authority on building codes, said 
Hegemier, 

It isn't just bUildings that will 
be wrecked for humanity'S sake, 
though, aerospace structures, 
offshore strucrures, and bridges 
are also going to be studied, he 
said, Currently, Associate 
Director Dr. Frieder Seible is 
running an experiment that will 
be useful to those of us who 
travel on snowcovered mountain 
roads. Cal Trans is paying for 
this srudy, which examines the 
possibility of rehabilitation on 
old bridges suffering from 

The OffIce of Campus Recreation 
& ASUCSD present: 

continous freezing and thawing 
tearing them down and building 
new ones, 

The prime reason for building 
the lab, however, is not jobs like 
the Cal Trans project, but large-
scale testing of strucrural systems, 
said Hegemier. Involved in aD 
the testing wiU be professionals 
ranging from researchers to 
practicing strucrural engineers to 
building code officials. Hegemier 
said the vast experience these 
people bring to the lab will 
ensure that it's work will be, as 
Dr, Hegemier put it, "very widely 
recognized." 

Hegemier said he was "quite 
pleased" with the work of 
Chancellor Atkinson in obraining 
funds for the lab, The money for 
the remaining equipment, 
including the 15 hydraulic 
actuators that do the work of 
shaking a structure, has still not 
been officially approved, 
According to Dr, Hegemier, "the 
NSF (National Science 
Foundation) has committed itself 
in front of the Chancellor," orally 
agreeing to supply $1.2 million 
dollars of the total S2.2 million 
spent for equipment. Once the 
paperwork is done, the 
remaining machinery and 
computers will be insralled, 
probably sometime in October. 

The ntw Charles Let PowtU Structures Lab hopes to influence global 
architectural prevention in the tva1t of an earthquake, 

Should one wish to have a 
fuD-scale test performed by the 

laboratory, it can do what the 
Director terms an "incredible job" 
at the low rate of approximately 
S500,OOO. Around a thousand 
probes will be attached to your 
five-story building, which will 
then be forced to contend with 
winds and eanhquakes simulated 
by the computer-controlled 
acruators. Dr. Hegemier noted 
that a shake table of equivalent 
capaCity would cost around $200 
million to build and wouldn't be 
able to simulate the wind. 

Another method of testing was 

illustrated by an experiment the 
Soviets did many years ago, 
"They took several apanment 
buildings, smaD ones, and blew 
them up ," said Dr, Hegemier. 
"The shock wave was much too 
brief, and everything happened 
too fast to realistically apply the 
results toward building codes: 

Today, the techniques of 
structural systems testing are far 
more sophisticated, evidence of 
which can be seen right here at 
UCSD. ~

A long future of preoccupation 
Since 1984. when fanner President for the 

National Endowment of the Humanities 
William Bennett. was appointed Secreta;Y of 
Education by that mental giant from Eureka 
College. Ronald Reagan. our universities have 
been beset by an onslaught of critical 
evaluations from both inside and outside of 
the academic sphere. Two years ago we were 
told by a federal commission that "we are 
experiencing the worst education crisis of 
this nation's history." At the time, many of us 
thought that the commission was refering to 
the President and is staff. and wholeheartedly 
agreed with this analysis. But 10 and behold 
we were mistaken, for the report did not tum 
out to be an in-house evaluation of those • 
members of the Reagan Administration whose 
IQ's had dipped somewhat below the Artic 
Circle, but was addressing the United States 
entire educational system. 

[r seemed that from that moment on. every 
educational institution in the land thought it 
best to review how they contributed to this 
hysteria, and what role they could play in 
returning America back to its glory days of 
instructing 'real' wisdom. Secretary Bennett 
himself recommended in '84 that university 
students should "divest themselves of their 
sterios, cars, vacations, etc ., etc .... and begin 
to indulge themselves in the wonders of 
Western Civilization. such as the works of 
Aristotle , Kant. Locke. Smith, and Richard 
Nixon. Bennett's repon. and other national 
proposals like it, also spoke of the "unhappy 
disarray" of undergraduate CUrricula, the 
"chronic paralysis" of faculties, the "loss of 
integrity of the bachelor's degree," a "vacuum 
of educational leadership," and "a failure of 
nerve and faith on the pan of many college 
faculties and administrators ." 

The University o f Cali fo rn ia has taken the 
criticisms and recommendations contained 
within the national reports qui te seriously. By 
last June, the UC had partially authored and 
contributed to the "Master Plan" which 
laboriously concerns itself with the future of 
education in California - and had drawn up 
more specific proposals by way of various 
Task Forces. 

The report that we feel warrants the closest 
attention is titled , "Lower Civision Education 
in the University of California." Although this 
document contains some very well-thought 
Out. and important recommendations, such as 
the institution of freshman-sophmore 
seminars. and enhancement of the global 
learning experience of students, systematic 
reviews of lower division education, more 
thorough evaluations of temporary faculty, 
and a demand that the best and brightest 
faculty members teach core courses, there are 
a few positions that were taken in the report 
that disturbs us. 

The faculty and adminstrators who make 
up the Task Force tenned lower division 
education as a process that has a very c\ear-
cut, missionary aspect to it. In fact, it claims 
[hat since the beginning, the University has 
"meant to bring students into the collegiate 
world and to preoccupy them from 
approximately age 18 to approximately age 
20." They hope, and in a pOSitive manner, to 
fill undergraduates with "the understanding of 
the fundamental ideas and concepts on 
which society is founded , as part of 
preparation for responsible citizenship . . . to 
expose students from diverse economic and 
cultural backgrounds to the great ideas. 
concepts, and events that have shaped our 
culture (often stated in terms of the western 
heritage) ... to provide a common educational 
experience which serves to define 
institutional and peer group identification 
and affiliation." 

There are many astounding conceptual 
problems that a university will be forced to 
confront if it attempts to "preoccupy" 
students with collegiate life, most especially if 
it stresses the increasingly rejected traditions 
of western heritage. One of those traditions 
can be called "educational elitism," and it has 
often arisen when young adults are taught not 
to emphaSize the afflictions of the world in 
their daily lives, but the more abstract, and 
ind ividualistic problems that a univerSity can 
present to the impreSSionable student. One 
consistent truth abut university education is 
that many students fail to make the grade, or

become alienated from the univerSity 
community. precisely because of the 
systemized formula that they have been cast 
into. For the Task Force to assume that you 
can ever provide "a common educational 
experience" that will "institutionalize peer 
group affiliation" is ludicrous and exhibits a 
peculiar insolence from the history of student 
groupings in this nation. 

What students respond to, and what has 
brought student.s together in a productive 
union are common generational experiences 
that transcend academia. If students do have 
a "mission" to achieve in a university 
surrounding with the help of faculty and 
administrators, it is to break the destructive 
mold that patriarchy and paternalism place 
upon academia. 

We hold the belief that nearly all of the 
administrators and faculry who contributed to 
this very valuable report will heed the call of 
students to open their ears to the very people 
who they are about to send on this "mission." 
It would appear impossible to implement all 
the recommendations in the report(s) withut 
constant student imput. We suggest that the 
entire community instruct each other on what 
type of education model suits the student of 
the 80's. For children almost always reject 
paternalism after they are called adults. IGI

Another chapter of the great rip-off 
By RICARDO YOUNG 

Everyone buys books and 
supplies at the UniverSity 
Bookstore because it is 
convenient while paying fees 
and adding or dropping classes. 
But there is a great cost for this 
convenience tacked on by the 
Bookstore . Many students walk 
in there and buy everything they 
need without thinking about the 
prices. 

For example. a new paperback 
physics book was put out by the 
publishers of its hardcover 
version, with a reduced price. 
The Bookstore, however. ignored 
the concept of "the cheaper 
book" and sold the paperback at 
the same price as the hardcover. 
It can do this because there is 
no other place to buy such a 
book within a reasonable 
distance of the school. 

Another problem with the 
Bookstore is its book resale 
policy. A friend of mine resold 
her Visual Ans 13 textbook, 
which cost $20.95 new. She 
received only $5. despite the fact 
that the book W'dS in excellent 
condition. 

The sale of used books has 
also been used to increase profits 
for the Bookstore. I bought a 
book for TCWP IA from the 
Bookstore which was deSignated 
as a used book by a · uscd" 
sricker on the cover. I thought I 
was making a sman buy. but I 
acrually paid the price of a new 
book. The prices for similar new 
books were stamped on the first 
pages. while the listed prices on 
the front covers were punched 
out with a hole puncher. In one 
paperback I purchased. they had 
punched out the original price 
on the front cover. but were 
apparently tOO inept to see the 
price sticker on the back cover 
from the first rime it was sold. 

What can we do to avoid this 
injustice - avoid going to the 
Bookstore? But where do we get 
the books and supplies we need? 
Ralph 's and Sav-On are both fully 
stocked with all the school 
supplies one could ever need 
(pens, paper. folders. and so on). 
If one cannot find the necessary 
supplies at those two locations. 
the General Store student 
cooperative in the Student 
Center also has a good supply of 
school needs. Other alternative 
sources for books include KB. 
Books. located in La JOlla Village 
Square, Revelle Bargain Books 
and Groundwork Books. which 
are both srudent cooperatives. 

KB. Books sens used books 
that are in good condition . and 
at very good prices. Revelle 
Bargain Books is a student 
cooperative used bookstore and 
sells books for students. It asks 
students to set a price for their 
books and then Revelle Bargain 
Books adds on 15 percent for 
prorating costs. Croundwork 
Books is a student cooperative 
and deals mosdy in politically-
oriented pa~rback books. 

Although these alternative 
sources for books are good 
sources, they sometimes lack 
sufficient numbers- of books. KB. 
sometimes runs out of certain 
books and cannot restock 
quickly enough to satisfy the 
needs of the students. It is also 
located off-campus and can pose 
a problem for unmotivated 
students because it is quite a 
walk from cenain pans of the 
campus. ReveDe Bargain Books is 
a good idea. but is a painful wait 
for srudents who are selling 
books through it because many 
srudents need to have the money 
immediately to buy books for the 

upcoming quaner and cannot 
wait for the pOtentially lengthy 
payback period. Groundwork 
Books has a six percent discount 
on all of its books. and has a few 
"ten percent discount days· each 
~ea.r. Grou~dwork. though. has a 
hmlted topiC list. with no books 
being sold dealing with the 
physical sciences. 

The above alternatives are 
good ideas. but are not reliable 
enough for everyone; inevitably. 

people immediately need the 
books. go to the bookstore. and 
become victim to Its high prices. 

I propose a new method for 
students to get rid of the books 
they don't need , and also to find 
the books they do need. while 
receiving good prices for their 
books and paying reasonable 
prices for used books from other 
srudents. 

During, the first week of the 
quaner. srudents who need to 

buy and/ or sell books should 
assemble in the Revelle Plaza or 
maybe Muir Field for a book 
exchange. There could be 
different tables or locations for 
each subject. Students desiring to 
sell or buy a book would go to 
the table of the particular subject 
for which they wished to sell or 
buy a book. Once they are at the 
proper subject table. their market 
skills would carry them in 
bargaining the book prices. If 
evetyOne's books aren't sold. or if 
some people can't find the books 
they want, there could be a 
phone list for each subject. 
indicating which person has 
what book or who needs the 
book. This book exchange 
should last for the entire first 
week of each quarter [0 give 
everyone enough time to find a 
seller or a buyer. Once the week 
is over. students who still haven't 
sold or bought their books can 
usc the phone list to contact 
each Other after the first week for 
a possible deal.. 

Critics might ask. "How will 

this be funded?" The answer is it 
doesn't need to be funded . It will 
not cost money to do it. Tables 
can be borrowed from the 
school. and employees wiD be 
volunteers or members of the AS. 
Critics might also say that 
although the book exchange may 
save money, it is inconvenient 
relative to the Bookstore. On the 
contrary, the book exchange is 
quite convenient. because the 
problem of acquiring and selling 
books is taken care of in one 
week of exchange. Buyers and 
sellers can set their prices and 
receive decent prices for books. 

My proposal nOt only calls for 
finding alternative sources for 
getting books, but also for 
boycotting the Bookstore entirely. 
If the Bookstore realizes how 
much business it would lose . 
then prices might come closer to 
reality and justice. The managers 
of the Bookstore should become 
more conscientious about the 
prices it sets and StOP its 
constant search for profit at the 
expense of the customer. Il:J

But the sun down there is a

and shame. I speak painfully; shy

end. 

Hidden partiaUy from view are 
the pages of photos, artocities. 

I think .. . "wiU it rain larer

my conscience still teUs me I am 
a North American, and again my 
face bums. It is clear the stakes 
got raised last year, when Ortega 
visited the enemy. If only 
humans could learn to unlearn 
how to kill each other. But the 
political arena is cold now, no 
blood to wann the lunatic fringe 
with the shouts of betting 
unifonned colonels and their 
hard, caUoused hands. Except

bums. 

The knife went where it was

to bear all his weight before it

UC labels undergrad education "neglected child" 
By CHERYL CARTWRIGHT, Slaff Wrircr 

T WO recent reports suggest that despite recent widespread departmental 
and undergraduate program 
revisions , UCSO's lower-division 
education may be a "neglected 
child: In June of this year, a 
Universiey of CalifornIa Task 
Force produced a sixey-five page 
"Lower Division Education in the 
Universiey of California» report, 
while a ream of 175 UCSO 
communiey members compiled a 
385-page "UCSO Self-Study for 
Reaffinnation of Accreditation " 
In Apnl 1986 in order to 
"proVIde the campus with a 
thorough self-assessment as It 
plans for the next 10 years to 20 
years' and to produce a 
descriptive and critical document 
of lasting utiliey to UCSD faculey, 
administration and students." 

Although the reports concede 
that "the quality of education is 
di fficult to measure" and hope 
not to spread a gloomy picture , 
evidence shows that many of 
UCSO's undergraduate classes 
are overcrowded, have limited 
research, computer, perfonnance, 
rehearsal and storage facilities, 
and are taught by less regulated 
vis iring professors or by 
unsupervised graduate studenrs 
as teaching assistanrs, who often 
have difficulty with the English 
language and nonnal American 
classroom customs. 

At any given time there are 
around 600 teaching assistants 
instructing UCSD 
undergraduates, according to a 
UCSD news release. Each year 
mon: than 250 teaching 
assistanrs begin meeting with 

classe~ for the first time. 
Teaching assistanrs are usuaUy 
graduate studenrs who are paid 
to teach smaDer sections of large 
undergraduate classes at the 
universitY. 

Under the direction of John 
Andn:ws and the coordination of 
Claire Langham of UCSD's 
Teaching Assistant Development 
Program, the "Peer Rtsource 
Nerwork for Foreign Teaching 
Assistanrs" projecI hopes to help 
10 foreign reaching assistanrs 
with the problems of teaching 
undergraduates in an American 
universiey. The fon:ign TAs will 
meet with a dozen American TAs 
during a three-day n:treat, with 
three foUow-up sessions planned 
during the school year, and 
begin to develop a peer netwOrk. 
The project is the first of its kind 

a~ UCSD and is funded by the 
National Association of Fon:ign 
Student Affairs (NAFSA). 

The Task Force n:pon says, 
" . .. the lower division is 
something of a neglected child 
in renns of infonnation gathered, 
attention paid , and critical 
n:view given to it: The report 
recommends that "teaching 
assistanrs whose native language 
is not English should be required 
10 pass the oral TOEfl (the Test 
of English as a Second Language) 
examination: It also 
recommends that mechanisms 
should be developed for the 
more systematic selection, 
review, and evaluation of 
temporary faculey, and for their 
bener incorporation into the 
educational life of the campus,» 
and "campuses should review 
and Improve mechanisms for the 
training, supervision, and 
evaluation of teaching assistants, 
especially at the depanmental 
level: 

"It is hard for me to 
understand my calculus professor 

becuase of his accent, and 
because he does not speak 
English very well. I still go to 
lecture , but I just do not ask him 
any questions," Kathy Parker, a 
fourth -year biology major, said. 

Although departments an: 
required to reserve 10 percent' of 
their teaching positions for 
visiting professors and temporary 
staff to allow diversiey and 
flexibility in the depanmem's 
offered courses, pennanent 
professors of each depattment 
are supposed to teach lower-
division classes. However, the 
June report shows that "in any 
given year, the facul ty of the 
Universiey is composed of 
approximately 3+ percent 
temporary faculry" who are not 
subject Ot the stringent 
depanmental regulations exacred 
of regular professors. Many 
studenrs complain of being 
unable to contact a visiting

Quality of UC education evaluated 
Continued from page 7 
professor at the end of a quarter 
to retrieve papers and 
examinations and to contest 
grades after the professor has 
returned to his or her college. As 
well, a large number of visiting 
professors can weaken a 
department's cuniculum, 
continuity and predictability 
when students select classes. 

The rise of visiting professors 
and many of UCSD 
departments' internal problems 
stem from changing 
demographics at both the 
university and national levels. 
Technical departments such as 
EECS, Mathematics, Mechanical 
Engineering, and Ecomomics 
compete for top researchers and 
professors with the military- • 
industrial complex. which pay 
much higher salaries. As 
professors and top graduate 

students leave academia for 
industty. more VIsiting professors 
are hired to fill their vacancies. 
The vicious cycle perpetuates as 
any competent professors UCSD 
hopes to recruit from other 
universities judge the 
departments by the strength. 
quality and availability of its 
graduate students, faculty and 
program, which is weakened by 
the attrition rate . 

As the United States becomes 
a more technical society. liberal 
ans and humanities departments 
such as history, literature , 
sociology and drama face serious 
problems of their own, such as 
declining undergraduate 
enrollment as students shy away 
from these majors, which they 
fear are not employable, not 
economically rewarded and 
impractical. while undergraduate 
calculus, chemistry and physics 

classes are overcrowded with 
teachin~ assistants with an 
overburdened teaching load. 

Students may never get to 
interact with the actual professor 
and may have to wait in lines to 
see the teaching assistant during 
limited office hours. 

Funding concerns limit some 
of the social science 
departments. which do not 
receive the large research grants 
that the science departments are 
granted . Because of inadequate 
library facilities. the Political 
Science Department has difficulty 
rectuiting potential faculty 
interested in serious research. 
Department problems may be 
more logistical in Uterature and 
Psychology are criticized because 
of their lack of structure 
permitted in an attempt to allow 
students flexibility in their 
curriculum. The Psychology 

Department has reduced the 
number of its self-paced classes 
after their effectiveness was 
questioned by the Committee on 
Education Policy. The History 
Department has yet to repalce 
many of the professors it lost to 
retirement and death in the early 
1980's. 

The unforese en growth rate of 
the number of UCSD 
undergraduates strains the 
University's physical , capital . 
planning and educational 
resources. There is a lack of 
housing, classrooms, teaching 
staff and parking, and the 
University is scrambling to build 
new accommodations. 

"One of the greatest challenges 
facing the University in the 
1980s stems from the changing 
demographics of the state. 
Within the next 15 years. it is 
anticipated that California's 
population will consist largely of 

members of ethnic minority 
groups . . . . " suggests the UCSD 
Self-Study, which further 
expresses fear that "there are 
many lessons to learn about how 
beSt to achieve and serve an 
ethnically and socioeconomically 
diverse student body." 

In 1983. the percentage of 
black h igh school graduates 
eligible fo r UC admission was 
only 3.6 percent, and for 
Hispanics only 4.9 percent. "If 
the University is to meet its 
affirmative action goals, it must 
become more involved than it 
has been in the effort to increase 
the percentage of Hispanics and 
blacks eligible for admiSSion ," the 
Self-Study says. 

The Task Force Report 
likewise forewarns of "the 
inadequacy of opportunities for 
international and multicultural 
experiences, including language

long~rm goal is ~ periphery 
parking system, WIth parking 
areas around the edges of UCSD 
being linked by a shuttle system 
to help students in getting not 
only from car to campus, but also 
from class to class on time. 

According to the Parking 
Office, student parking 
representatives from each college

insttuction ; this problem 
promises to intensify in the 
future , as the cultural and ethnic 
diversities of the state and its 
campuses increase." 

The Self-Sturty found serious 
problems with the available 
library facilities, because limited 
space means a shortfall of 1,460 
reader stations, and too-small 
library staff means a backlog in 
cataloging and searches for 
material. The Me\vyl catalog is 
not fully operational, and the 
hours of library operation need 
to increase. There is also 
concern over preservation of 
library materials and 
archives. However, UCSD is the 
recipient of a 5196,000 grant 
from the U.S. Department of 
Education to strengthen , 
preserve. and extend access to 
its collection of contemporary 
poetry. 

The Task Force report, done 
under the Master Plan, the 
educational framework for 
California's three-segment public 
education system for a quarter of 
a century, looked into problems 
of state university and 
community coBege transfer 
students into the University of 
California. 

In an attempt to improve the 
student teacher ratio at the 
lower-rlivision leVel, the Task 
Force proposes freshman-
sophomore seminars of 15 
students which would allow an 
increase in writing aSSignments 
and intimate give-and-rake 
between student and professor 
over professor's current research. 
Seminars for an entering class of 
3 ,000 would require 100 
seminars. 

The alternatives we have 
brought forward have in 
coriunon the objective of adding 
an increment of intellectual 

imensity, involvement in and 
integration into the Iower-
division years , while at the same 
time attempting 10 stay within 
the bounds of reality with 
respect to resources required ," 
the Force repons. 

Vice ChanceDor of 
Undergraduate Affairs, Dr. Joseph 
Watson feels that the lower 
division education at UCSD is, 
overaD, "better than other UC 
schools." 

"The report does not poim a 
gloomy picture. I think it's 
important to make that a 
balanced report, pointing out the 
strengths of undergraduate 
education, along with the 
weaknesses: Watson said. 

The self-study report will be 
presented at the next UC 
Regents meedng and at that time 
recommendations for planning 
and curriculum improvements 
will be made, said Watson. IZiJ

found there in 1869, and the town iuelf was 
mapped out in 1870. In those days, it took two 
days by stagecoach to reach julian from San 

Di~, a 6O-mile trip which can be made today 
in nO( much more than an hour despite the 
winding roads. 

The gold ran out around the rum of the 
cenrury, and when it did, the folks in julian 
decided to try growing apples instead. That 
venrure was so successful that in just a few years 
that julian apples won eiaht medals in the 
Jamestown Exposition of 1907. 

Julian's eye 
Because of the altirude and weather 

conditions, apples grown there are still the 
SWl'etcst you'D ever taSlC. julian apples have been 
tested and found to have the highest sugar 
content of any grown in the United States. There 
are more than 100 varieties of apples, and Julian 
grows many of them - jonathan, King David, 
Delicious, McIntosh, Newton Pippins, Baldwin, 
Russet, Gravenstein. October is halVest season, 
and the whole town gets into the act. . 

The toWn of julian is about the s~ of four 
city blocks, with Highway 78 runnin~ right down 
the middle of it. Despite its smaDness, julian has 
10 or 12 restaurants in those few blocks. During 
Apple Days - each weekend in October -
close to 20,000 people jam the little town that

apples 
Continued from page 1) 
the fresh apple cider, munch on 
fresh apple pies, and just to buy 
apples, because Julian apples 
almost never make it out of 
town. Everyone here sells apple 
pies. The Farmer's Market, 
Mom's Piehouse, even the 
Chamber of Commerce sells 
thousands of pies during Apple 
Days. 

At the big orchards, people 
can pick their own apples, 
which are then weighed to 
determine the price. Julian Apple 
Mountain Orchard (1125 Farmer 
Road) even has a program that 
lets you rent your own apple 
tree. Families or individual 
renters can come up on 
weekends, pick apples and have 
picnics. Renters select their 
favorite trees out of 600 choices: 
then a sign is put up identifying 
their choice as rented and a 
yellow ribbon is tied around the 
tree. Special activities are 
planned each weekend for tree 
renters: square-dance callers the 
first Sunday, apple doU-carving 
the second Saturday and pie-
making the second Sunday. The 
climax comes on the third 
Saturday, when the season closes 
with the digging up of a 20-
~on reserve of hard cider 
Duried for the past year. 
Everyone gathers round as-year-
old Louis Juch, Julian's oldesc 
living pioneer. Juch tells old 
pioneer stories and oversees the 
making of the hard cider to be 
buried for next year. 

Two more ways to immerse 
yourself in the flavor of the 
festivities: At. the Cider Mill, you 
can watch the cider-making 
process through a big p1ate-glass 
window, and then have free 
samples of cider. And the 
Farmer's Market sells just about 
everything imaginable made with 
ae'ples - apple candy, cider, 
jeUy, jams, juice, dried apples, 
and apple doDs. 

There is also a museum, which 
holds many relics of the old 
mining days. Billie Rasmussen of 
the Chamber of Commerce says, 
'We caD (the museum) our attic: 
everything we need to throw 
away, we put there instead." 

And there is an original 
melodrama each harvest season. 
written and performed by local 
people. ·We try to give it a local 
angle: says Patsy MacFarlane, 
who's in charge of the 
production. So, it is usually about 
",ld mining or logging. This 
year's melodrama is caBed '"The 
Stalwan Surveyor." It relates the 
tale of how the Stalwan Surveyor 
saved the Cuyarnaca Aoat (you 
"float" a claim on a gold mine). 

To get to Julian by freeway, 
take Interstate 805 to 8, go east 
on 8, then take 79 north. For a 
more scenic route, take Miramar 
Road through Poway, following 
Si east out of Poway to julian 
Road, which CYentuaOy becomes 
Highway 78. Follow 78 into 
downtown Julian. Be sure to take 
a sweater (mountain weather can 
be changeable) and a big 
appetite. Apple Days take place 
each weekend in October. For

I t was all a malIer of luck , and both UC Irvine head coach Derek Lawther and UCSD 
assistant coach Brian McManus 
agree that the Tri tons had very 
litde of it. 

"They were very lucky," said 
McManus after UCSD lost to the 
Division I Anteaters for the 
second time this season, 1-0, in 
a game played at Warren Field 
Wednesday afternoon. "The 
referee was atrocious. We had 
several opportunities taken away 
from us." 

The key play that might have 
cost the Tritons a tie occurred 
late in the game. With less than

referee did nOl make the call To 
McManus, that was the 
di fference in the game. "If the 
referee makes the call, It's a tie 
game," said McManus. 

Lawther was Just glad his learn 
came out with the win. 

"They were just unlucky," said 
Lawther. "They controlled at least 
85 percent of the game, but we 
were just brave on defense." 

UCSD, though, according 10 
McManus, played poorly. "We 
didn't play well at all, especially 
in the backfield. We gave away a 
lot of silly balls: said McManus. 

Lawther was still impressed 
with UCSD's play. "They're Just a

U CSD men's and women's cross-country reams faced a bundle of Division I, 
including the likes of UC 
Berkeley, at the SDSU Azrec 
Cross Country Invitational in 
Balboa Park. 

They were the only Division 01 
team competing in a field of 
almost all Division I and II 
teams, along with a few reputable 
running clubs. But dispite a few 
doubts from team members, they 
ran surprisingly well . 

"I thought we woul!! get 
killed ," said team member Jeff 
Gregg, "but 1 think we did pretty 
well, considering the 
competition." Gregg expressed 
the same general sentiments as 
others on the ream, but most 
were pleased with the team's 
perfotmance. 

The UCSD women's team 
make a good showing, expecially 
in comparison to last year's 
perfotmance. Coming in first for 
UCSD and 89 overall was 
sophomore Sabrina Jensen , with 
a time of 19: 10 for the five-
kilometer curse. 

"I'm really psyched," said 
Jensen. "I felt flat at the 
beginning and was afraid I 
wasn't going [0 do well, but my 
time surprised me: 

Coming in second for UCSD 
a[ld 111 overall was sophomore 
Gisele English. with a personal 
best of 19:39. 

"Nothing fazed me ," said 
English. "I felt better than I've 
ever felt in a race. 1 didn't let 
anytfiing psych me out. I'm really 
happy about my time." 

Juniors Nicole Rainey and 
Andrea Veatch, came in with 
times of 20:16 and 21 :01 , 
finishing founh and fifth , 
respectively. 

Coming in first for the UCSD 
men's team and 137 overall on 
the ten kilometer course was 
freshman Merrel Hora, with a 
time of 34:00. 

"I felt really strong: said Hora, 
"I could have put out a lot more , 
especially at the fi msh . I Just 
need more experience , because 
this was my first collegiate race:' 

In second for the men's team 
was Steve Steck, with a time of 
34:53, followed by Jeff Gregg, 
Chris MeNan and Jan 
Borglokowski, with times of 
35:13, 35:20 and 35:57, 
respectively. The UCSD men's 
team finished 21 overall, with a 
score of 763. 

"It was a good tune-up race for 
Berkeley next week," said Gregg, 
the number three runner on the 
men's team. 

Next week's All-Cal meet is in 
Berkeley, where all the UC men's 
teams will compete against one 
another. The women will go to 
the Road Runner Invitational in 
Bakersfield . 

Saturday's meet was the third 
meet of the season for the UCSD 
team , and both the men's and 
the women's teams were 
extremely optimistic about this 
year's team and the season 
ahead. 

")'m jazzed," said head coach 
Andy Skier, "we ran so much 
better today. I know we 'll do well 
in our own division ." Ii:]

without the services of 
goalkeeper Steve Gullian. Gullian 
was in high spirits before the 
game against USIU last 
Wednesday and there was no 
wondering why. Having racked 
up a string of six straight 
victories, only two goals had 
been scored against him during 
this streak. Soon three of his 
teammates, recuperating from 
injuries, would be back to add 
an extra impetus to the team's 
playoff drive. There is no 
forewarning that he would soon 

rejOin his teammates on the 
injured list. 

The Triton 's sixth game 
winni ng streak came to a 
crushing end, and so did 
Gullian's knee . GuUian 
confronted an oncharging USIU 
forward who ended up landing 
his foot on Gullian's knee teari ng 
several ligaments. 

USIU went on [0 win the 
game 4-0, but that was only the 
beginning of UCSD's woes. 
Gullian was the only goalie on 
the roster and that left coach 
Derek Armstrong in a bind. To 
fiU the pOsition . Armstrong 
recalled Greg Stadler who had 
played backup goalie two years 
ago, but had been inactive since. 

To Armstrong's deli~ht the 

deCIsion was a good one. UCSD 
proceeded to rebound with a 4-1 
victory over Southern California 
College. Stadler played well 
despite the lack of time for 
preparation. 

But Armstrong is quick [0 
point out the success his team 
has been having despite the 
injuries. Mike Kappes, according 
to Armstrong, "has been a strong 
performer and a key to our 
success." Patterson has also 
continued to play weD and has 
had nine goals in eight games, 
well ahead of last year's pace. 

Armstrong sees their recent 1-
o win against Chapman , a 
Division n team that tied UCLA. 
"as the highlight of the year so 
far." ~

Ranked seventh in the 
nation, Tritons on a roll 
By BRIAN ITOW 

T HE UCSD women's soccer team continued to roll through its Division III 
opponents Saturday night as it 
trounced the Pomona-Pitzer 
Sagehens 7"(). 

With its leading scorer, 
Adrienne Clark, out due 10 a 
hamstring pull. the Tritons had 
10 rely on seven differen1 scorers 
to record their seventh stra ight 
win. After a slow stan, Teresa 
Schwarr scored on a penalty kick 
in the fifteenth minute. later in 
the half, Chris ladish 
contributed a great indiVidual 
effort as she slashed and cut 
around four players before 
putting the ball in the back of 
the net to give the Triton women 

• a 2"() lead after 45 minutes. 
Early in the second half. the 

Tritons scored a goal that was, 
according to coach John Leney. 
"the best I'd ever seen as the 
UCSD coach." On the goal, 
Stephanie Savoy received a sweet 
birthday gift as she scored after 
some fine passing by ladish, 
Schwarr and Lynn BaUey. 
Heather Mauro, Bailey, Wendy 
Kaneko and Heidi Mitchum 
finished up the scoring as 
goalkeeper Heather Mcisaac 

. recorded her fifth shutout. 

"Ergo "ing 
for 
funds 

By KAREN KUMM 

W HILE the average UCSD student is anticipating dancing 
and partying at this year's Fall 
Festival on the Green, the 
women's crew has something 
completely different in mind. 
These rowers will be 
participating in a H-hour row-a-
thon to raise the money to 
purchase a new boat. 

The crew's goal is to buy a 
Vcspoli 155, a top-of-the-line 
racing sheD to be used solely by 
them. In the past, boats were 
shared between the men and 
women. The approximate cost of 
such a boat is S10,OOO. The row-
a-thon wiD be the largest of their 
fund raising activities this faR; 
the team is hoping to raise about 
S13,OOO to cover expenses. 

The row-a-thon begins at 
midnight, Thursday, October 2, 
and will continue until midnight 
Friday. There arc about 22 
returning varsity women this 
year, and each will row 2-3 
hours on an ergometer. a 
simulated rowing machine. The 
women have been collecting 
sponsors for this event since 
August. Two machines will be set 
up, and the women will row in 
hour-long shifts, with their 
distances measured in miles. 

Ergomecers arc synonymous 
with physical torture. They arc 
used regularly by rowers in 
training to build endurance and 
improve technique. "Doing-an-
erg" is, for most, a dreaded 
activity, because it hurts eveIY 
muscle in the body and usually 
brings on nausea. 

The row-a-thon will begin on 
the lawn next to Urey Hall, the 
site of the Fall Festival activities, 
and at approXimately 4 pm 
Friday wiD move to near the gym 
steps, where the band will be 
playing at the T.G. ~ 

UCSD continues to play hard-
nosed defense against 
opponents. Against Pomona-
Pitzer. UCSD never looked like it 
would concede a goal as the 
defense once again dominated 
the game. During the team's 
seven-game winning streak, it 
has given up only o~e goal. 

The UCSD women are now 
ranked seventh nationally in 
NCAA Division III, and first in 
the Far West region. with a 7-1 
record. Their lone setback was a 
3-1 heanbreaker to UC Santa 
Barbara. a nationaUy ranked 
Division I team. Throughout the 
1986 season, they have scored 
H goals while aDowing only four. 

leaney is looking rorward to 
the NCAA Division DI playoffs, 
because the team "seems to be 
blowing away Division m 
opponents."lts closest game was 
a S-O shutout of Occidental 
College. 

One reason for the Triton 
success is that in addition to an 
already strong from line and 
defense, the team has seen its 
freshmen midfielders - Teresa 
Schwarr. Sheila Takahashi and 
Stephanie Savoy - emerge as a 
cohesive unit. 

The Triton women look 
certain to gain a berth in the 
NCAA Division OJ playoffs. Their 
next home game is October 7 at 
3 pm vs. long Beach Slate. CJ

"Becawe Ms. Williams is a 

black writer, originall, a poet, 
writing about a literary subject, 
some readers may expect Dew 
Rose to be the next Color Purple. 
While that comparison is 
somewhat superficial, it is not 
wholly inappropriate." -
David Bradley, New York 
Times Book Review, AUlUlt 
7, 1986. 

"Ms. Williams" is UCSO's 
own Sherley Anne Williams, 
the warm, articulate professor 
of Black American Literature. 
That particular review il what 
Sandra Oijkstra, Williams' 
literary agent, enthusiastically 
contends sparked the 
publicity phenomena 
surroundinll Dessa Rose. 

Dena Rose, althoullh not 
Williams' first published 
work, is by far her mOlt 
widely and critically 
acclaimed. The novel, set in 
the 19th century, Is based on 
two historical characters. One 
is a prellf\8nt black woman 
who helped lead an Uprisil\ll of 
a group of chained slaves in 
1829 Kentucky. The woman 
was c8uiht, convicted, and 
sentenced to hal\ll after the 
birth of her baby. The other 
character, a white woman 
livinll on an isolated farm in 
North Carolina, reportedly 

harbored runaway slaves 
durinll the early 18OOs. 
Williams learned of the two 
incidents throullh further 
research of Angela Davia' 
seminal essay, "Reflections 
on the Black Woman's Role 
in the Community of Slaves. " 
Williams writes, "How lad, I 
thought then, that theae two 
women never met." 

Williams Was intriKUed by 
these two incidenta. She uaed 
fiction to "recrea~ the world, 
departed from history" and 
enabled OesJa Rose to live, 
thus aHowinll the two women 
to meet, creating the powerful 
story of DesJa Rose. 

Sherley Anne Williams ia a 
poet first. Her PeaaJCk Poems 
won the 1976 National Book 
Award _ Her voice and 
lIestures carry a rhythm that 
makes simply watching her a 
pleasure. Thil poetic gift 
extends remarkable cadence, 
rhythm and dialogue into her 
first novel. 

"Why the subject of 
slavery?" she was asked_ "I 
find the period to be heroic. 
Slavery was a principled 
strugsie that we oUKht to 
celebrate; and to understand 
ourselves we need to 
understand both the heroism

Surely a rose 
of inspiration 

and the degradation of that 
period." 

Williams makes clear that 
"fortune has not caught up to 
fame_"It is evident, however, 
that respect mOlt certainly has 
caught up to fame. Dr. Donald 
Weslinll , Chairman of 
UCSD's Uterature Depart-
ment, exclaims, .. De.ssa Rose is 
a stupendous book. The 
whole department is very 
proud of our colleague." Fran 
Foa ter, Professor of English at 
SDSU, is already teacrunll the 
book in her Black American 

,writers clasa. She notel that 
Williams "foUowN Frederick 
Douala. in the clasa analysia 
of black slave narrativea." 
Alice Walker, the author of 
the Color Ps.rple, writes, "I am 
astonished, moved and 
delighted with the languaKe, 
the thought, the obvious 
collaboration of the ancestors 
and the love I read on these 
page .... 

Sandra Dijkstfa, explainil\ll 
the procesa of how the book 
lIot off the ground makes 
chinas clear_ "Because of the 
quality of the book abe had to 
work with, and the fact that 
Sherley was not an unknown. 
made brinaina it to New York 
that much easier," .he said. 
Yet. William Morrow and 

Company, Inc . , which 
publishes Sidney Sheldon and 
other " block buster"novels 
took a "chance" with the soon 
to award,winning first noveL 
DesJa Rose has recently been 
nomina red for the Pulliaer 
Prize. the Penn/ Faulkner 
Award and the American 
Book Award. 

Williams is currently hard 
at work teachinll her 
"Uterature and the Blues" 
clasa at UCSD. She is also 
writing the screenplay for 
Dma Rase. Unired Artists has 
purchaaed the movie riKitts. 
Irwin Winkler, who has 37 
Academy Awards to his credit 
and produced the "Rocky" 
movies, will be the film's 
producer. Williams is also 
busy attendinll readinp and 
siKnings. promotin(l her new 

novel. The UCSO Bookstore 
will hOlt a Book Signing party 
for her on October 8 from 
11 :30 am-Z pm . 

Dessa Rose, the character, 
explained her actions, "I kill 
white mens cause the same 
reason Masa kill Kaine. 
'Cause I can." Dessa Rose is 
the inspiring story of two 
women doinll what they can in 
an era that was marked by a 
race fightinll for what they 
couldn't do. Sherley Anne 
Williams and Dew Rose both 
are inspirinll UCSO' 
Literature Department to take 
steps that will move the 
department towards being 
more of a writirlll department. 
They hope to help students 
develop into young writers 
that will write for the sheer 
reason that " they can."

Lost Horizons found in timely remake 
bV ian barnard 

The newly-restored version 
of Frank Capra's 1937 film, 
Lost Horiton , raises the 
question of whether a 
restorer, Robert Gitt, can 
become the writer of a movie. 
The restored movie offers 
some potentially powerful 
and painful political insights, 
not only into the times in 
which it was made, but into 
the R eagan era as well. 

way of dealing with foreign affairs when he becomes for the film's broad anti-war 
foreign secretary. Although rhetoric, and are an Thatcher and Reagan's 
he admits that he would not indictment not only of war nuclear arms acquisitiveness 
really have the nerve to rebel, and Britain's colonia lis tic today. In fact, Conway's 
Conway's ideas provide a base belligerence, but also of "policv" is strikingly similar 

to that of the opposition 
Labor Party in contemporary 
England. 

Where Capra's vision fails, 
however, is in the alternative 

Lost Horiton starts with Bob 
Conway (Ronald Colman), 
the British foreign secretary-
ele c t , " saving" wh ite 
Britishers from a Chinese 
revolution , before he himself 
boards a plane with his 
brother and three other 
passengers to head for safety. 
Then comes the scene only 
hinted at in James Hilton's 
novel , on whi c h the 
screenplay was baaed, that was 
cut when the film was 
originally released, just before 
the Second World War: 
Conway muses on the 
callousness of saving a few 
white people while glibly 
leaving " 10,000 natives" 
behind. 

he presents to us. The 
travellers are taken to the 
utopian city of Shangri-La, 
which is admirably anti-
capitalistic, anti-materialistic, 
anti-war and which is anti-
authoritarian since there are 
no police. Its mottos, "be 
kind" and "everything in 
moderation," however, are 
wimpish and simplistic, and 
its detail is carelessly elitist. 

In his ardor to awe us with 
sumptuous sets and regal 
beauties. Capra fails to sustain 
his anti-hierarchical thesis. He 
movingly depicts the value 
and frustration of personal 
vision in an empty world and 
the "mind-forg'd manacles" 
that we create to deaden this 
vision; but Gitt's restoration 
work calls out attention to 
Capra 's attack on our social 
systems , and this attack 
totters. 

He realizes how quick we 
are to create "enemies," and 
speculates that he might 
"destroy all warcraft, II and 
initiate a revolutionary new Frank Capra'J elaborate .feU provide a Shangri·La for Robe!t Gitt'J remake 

The few suggestions Capra 
gives us on how to improve 
out society are too vague and 
contradictory to be either 
convincing or helpful. Lost 
Horit'Of\, is being shown until 
October of at the Ken Cinema.
