Iranian Government staggers but does not fall 
BY WILLIAM BEEMAN 

P al'ific Ne\\ ,!o, Sen ict' 
Letlers from [ran these cla\'s 

'arry an im-ariable phrase: 
"Vaz' kharob-e" - the 
situa tion is rotten. De-
strucl i\ e altacks againsl the 
[s lamic Hepubli c continue 
from it:" opponent~ and are 
co untcred by eq uall y 
demoral izi ng execu t ions on an 
unprecedented sca le. 

In th West. there seem~ to 
be a silent quesl ion IX'hind the 
rClx)rlingof th ese evenls: Wh) 
doesn't I he g()\ernmenl of the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomellli 
fa II under t he weight of such 
lerrible interna l discord? 

For many, th ques tion may 
be more of a wish t han a query. 
But even if one thoroughly 
di ... likes the Khomeini regime, 
It must be admitted that the 
staying power of the mulla hs 
constitutes an ex traord inary 
study in IX>litica l tenacity. 

, ('veral factors contribut e to 
the ability of t he cleri ca l 
lea der s o f t h e Is lamic 

I~ epublica n Part y (IRP) tohold 
togel her when political bodies 
in other areas of the wor ld 
wou ld have lo ng s in ce 
s u ccum bed . One primar y 
factor has more 10 do wi th Iran 
It self than with th e condition 
uf th e prese nt polit ica l 
leadersh ip. 

AmerIcans tend to believe 
that s trong centra l lead rship, 

a~ under the shah , is an 
inevitable feature of the 
Iranian politica l system. But 
in fact. Iranian hi~tory re\'eal~ 
quite a different pal tern . At 
times monarchs were strong; 
al other times Ihey were\\'eak . 
And yel Iran always ~lIn' i\·ed. 
Duri ng some periods of weak 
and indeed somel imes corrupt 
central control. as in Ihe 191h 
cenl ury, I here wa~ a 
:--urpri"ing pro:--perity III many 
areas of the econom \'. The 
waning of central authority 
was more t han balanced by 
growth fostered through local 
autonomy. 

l~ ep()r1S from the Iranian 
rou ntry~i d e during the past 
few months suggest that local 
autonomy once again has 
begu n to d evelop. The 
principal political dislur -
banc s are concentrat ed in the 
larger cities and in a few 
: pecia l region s such as the 
Iribal areas of the south and 
wes t, a nd the nort hern 
province of Gilan. 

The oppos i t ion to cen I ra I 
authority in these areas has 
been going on for more than 
I wo centuries. If Khomeini 's 
regime fe ll tomorrow, its 
'uccessors sti ll would ha,'e 10 
contend WIth demands for 
pol tica l con cess ions from 
th ese regions. 

Even in these areas, 
however, indications are that 

daily life continu ~ to chug 
a long as people havc turned to 
running their own affair~ 
ind pendently of Teheran_ 
Much of the popu lat ion "ee" i t ~ 
fale as not much beller or 
wor"e Ihan before - so wh\' 
rebel? -

A "econd faclor i" Ihal Ihe 
opposition to the IRP thus far 
has alN)lutelv failed in the 
mass mobilI7.ai ion of t he urban 
populat ion. [nt ellectual 
support for t he lefti~l 
l\1ujahide nand olher 
opposItion group" exists. but it 

i~ mostlv fearful and sIlent. 
Occasion-al so lIl arv acts of 
defiance, "uch as fOI:mer Prime 
Minister Mehdi Bazargan's 
recent public denouncement of 
the summary executiuns of 
Mujahideen -suPPl)rters. are 
thus quickly stifled. 

Ph ysica l support for the 
oppo 'ition come~ mostly from 
the young - th e last 
generation to receive secu lar 
ed ucation under the shah's 
regime. But many betw en 
ages 10 and 25 died in the 
origi nal revolution of 197 -79. 
Many more ha\'e jorned the 
pro-gover n men t revol u t ionary 
guard or areat waron the Iraqi 
fronl. Others have emigrated 
to the West. 

The reduced number of 
vouth:" that remain in the 
cit ies obviously has neit her 
the experience nor the arms to

Future of women's movement in doubt 
These aren't particularly 

good times for women. 
Each night, at theatres 

across the nation, women are 
asked to bear Burt Reynolds' 
baby (Paternity) or don 
cellophane· bottomed designer 
jeans (So Fine). 

Meanwhile, former first 
" ladies" Betty Ford and Lady 
Bird Johnson launch a last· 
ditch campaign to ratify the 
Equal Rights Amendment. 
which is all but dead. 

Perhaps more depres 'ing, 
the federal government 
intends to redefine rules on 
abortion and affirmative 
action, altering laws that have 
shaped the lives of an entire 
generation of women. 

And journalists don't help 
matters much . Ever·enlight-
ened Playboy informed its 
readers last month that the 

women's movement i s 
finished. Other publications 
such as Everywornan sti ll run 
silly features exploring "The 
First Few Times in Bed." 

Yet these untimely 
symptoms don't portend the 
death of the women's 
liberation movement. In as 
much as anti·feminist Phyllis 
Schlafly wou Id love to lead the 
nation m a nagging round of "r 
Told You So's," the women's 
movement is merely slowing 
down, weeding out and getting 
its act toget her. 

There's no doubt that the 
movement begun in the mid-
1960s has advanced the lives 
and fortunes of women more 
than anyone had expected. 

It was no small matter , back 
then , to que ·tion the roles of 
"girl" and "wife" and explore 
one's own talents. More than

they know, the movement 
paved the way for great 
numbers of today's young 
women to enter law practices, 
construction trades and 
political contests. 

During the 1970s, women 
began to paint in I he details of 
their lives. They pointed out 
that men underpaid women , 
discriminated against them, 
objectified them, abused them 
as spouses and lovers, and 
foolish ly believed they could 
do without them. This led 10 
the popular notion that the 
women's movement was a 
"war" between the sexes. 
What bunk. 

Whether the issue was 
s uffrage or reproducti ve 
rights, the women's move· 
ment has always fed on "what 
it means to bea woman." More 
than their male counterparts , 

women have always worked to 
define what they are. It's a 
phenomenon that men can't 
en tirely understand, much 
less fully appreciate. 

And though the movement 
is under bombardment from 
many camps this fa ll , it's 
about to take off on another 
tack: "Now that we've gained 
a portion of the rights we 
deserve," women as k, "how 
can we juggle our new 
res pon s ibilities with the 
unique ability t o bea r 
children?" 

In her new book, The Second 
Stage, feminist writer Betty 
Friedan warns that unless 
women get beyond "parrot-
ing ... the cli ches of women's 
liberation ," they'll never 
addres s the undeniable 
conflict of having both career 
and womb_ 

After years of struggling for 
Ihe right to choose, writes 
Friedan, women now have 
difficulty choosing the most 
traditional role: motherhood. 
Until a ll choices are made free 
options, women' · liberation 
won't be complete. 

"We have been su taining 
i!lus ions of choice where none 
exists. h is dangerous for 
women - or experts or 
politician s or leaders of women 
- to kid themselves that there 
is an y real c hoi ce that 
s ide s tep s the complex 
problems women face today in 
making a new life of family , 
work and love_" 

rr Friedan 's pro-family shift 
sound s Schlaflyesque, she 
goes on to say that the male 
experience can't be ignored in 
the future , Men, she believes,

Students rally against AS Council 
By PAUL FARWELL 

Slaff Wrilt'r 
David Tollner, the Activity 

Fee chair on the ASUCSD , has 
been busy creating a cru 'ade 
recent ly: 

In a letter pu blished in 
Monday's UCSD Guardian , 
Tollner openly criticized Ihe 
pres ent AS Coun cil for 
misus ing s t udent fund s and 
for misrepresenting studenl 
opinion on the issues of the 
boycotts. 

of the AS budget) to put on the 
film series, But mos t s tudents 
at the meeting Tue 'day night 
felt that t his was too large a 
s u m of money for one 
organization alone to receive. 

"There is no doubt that the 
( CWD ) film se ri es i s 
wort hwhile," Toll ne r said , 
"but whether or not they 
deserve $10,000 more than 
ot her organ izat ions is a good 
qu estion." 

Bagneris was unwilling to 
comment on the matter. 

One s tudent comm ented 
Tuesda y night that " the 
problem is not necessaril y t he 
CWD, but simply the total 
amount (o f descretion a r y 
expen 'es) that the student 
organizat ions as a whole have 
been given ... (l ike) the $BOO to 
send ou r beloved presiden t to 
Washington D.C." 

Toll ner hopes that student 
awareness wi ll make "council 

members think when they 
wa n t to spend stude n t 
money," 
Student representation 

Ever s in ce the AS voted to 
boycott Nes tle products, Coors 
beer, and the Chancellor's 
in augu ratio n , a common 
complai nt has been that rhe 
A didn't represent the \',,'111 of 
the "tudent oody. 

"We elect representatives to 
represent us," commented one 
..,tudent. "Tho"e people are 

supposed tovoicethe sludent' 
opinions, " 

Tol lner is basing the whole 
movement, in fact, on his 
belief that student: aren 't 
bei ng repre ented: "Being a 
student, I get a lot of input 
from other students who 
aren't involved in the AS. And 
90 perrent of that i. against 
what the AS ha.., said already," 
Tollner "aid,

Atkinson tells senate of UC woes 
By PETER MORTEN EN 
Chancellor Richard Atkin-

son told mem bers of the 
Academic Senate Tue day 
that there will be some lean 
years to come for UCSD in the 
face of a projected decline in 
enrollment and an immediate 
cut in financial re ources. 

But Atkin on assured the 
group during their firs t 
meeting of the year that with 
patience and input on the part 
of the faculty, UCSD can avoid 
an y serious finan cial or 
physical problems. 

The primary con cern 
expre ' 'ed by faculty attending 
the meeting was that Atkinson 
is allowing increa se d 
enrollment without an 
adequate increase in teaching 
s taff. 

"There will be no change in 
the faculty student ratio," 
Atkin 'on said . However. he 
added later that it may be 
necessary for the univer 'ity to 
have a one year lag between an 
enrollment increase and an 

accompanying increase in 
faculty size. 

At kinson told the group that 
he expects enrollment to climb 
slightly in the next two years 
before the post-baby boom 
population decline ·et · in. 

UCSO. however, may not 
feel the extreme severity of the 
decline. as the number of high 
chool students eligible for 

college admission within the 
declining population rises. 
(Atkin 'on mentioned that 
UC D i 'econd onl y to 
Berkeley in SAT scores for 
entering freshmen and he 
predicts a ·teady ri e in SAT 
scores across th e nat ion 
during the next 15 years.) 

For the present . though, 
overcrowd i ng in so me 
department s - especiall y 
AMES and EEC - may 
require the in ·titution of 
evening classes, he said . 

This year 's unexpected rise 
in enrollment stemmed from 
an unusually high return rate 
seen throughout the entire UC 
system, Atkinson explained.

But the mos t important 
problem the university faces 
now, Atkin 'on said, is the 
s tate-mandated immediate 
two percent cut in UC' · 1981-
82 operating budget followed 
by a five per ent cut from 
1981 -82 base level in the next 
fi scal year. 

Alth o ug h ac ting UC 
Presiden t William Fretter has 
as ked for an emergency 
meeting with the governor 
regard ing t he sudden cut s, 
Atkin 'on said , " I doubt if 
much wil1 come of it." 

To counteract part of the 
five percent cut in 1982-83, 
Atkin so n sa id that th e 
univer 'ity is con ' idering a 
special. one-lime" 'urcharge" 
of $25 on t he s tud ent 
educational fee. 

The hi ke in student fees 
would be accompanied by 
"across the board cuts and 
programmatic cuts," Atkinson 
sa id. He add ed t hat t he 
uni versity is reluctant to make 
any list of programs that 

might be cut because It might 
give the state legi 'Iature the 
opportunit y to dir ectly 
influence UC curricu lu m. 

Also, a "soft freeze" on 
faculty hiring is now in effect 
at the reques t of systemwide 
administ rat ion in an effort to 
cut back on departmental 
expendi tures. 

Atkinson answered senate 
ques ti ons about UCSD' s 
com put at ional center, which 
handle ' the vast quant ities of 
adminis trative programming 
necessa r y t o kee p the 
uni vers it y operating. There is 
concern that t he Burroughs 
system is now inadequat e to 
handle the 'um of UCSD's 
computing work, and frequ ent 
cost overruns have prompted 
t he a dmini s tr a t io n t o 
in vestigate alternatives to the 
current system. 

A new system would take 
well over 18 months to come 
"on-line," he said , quelling 
rumors that a change could be 
made withou t 'ufficient notice 
to facult y.

Students speak out against AS Council 
continued from page 5 
much people on the AS trying 
to do what they think the 
students want. (The problem 
is) when they do things that 
they know students don't 
want them to do," said one 
st udent. 

Another student commen-
ted t hat the council is being 
controlled by a 'mall group of 
onl y a few peo pl e. " I 
think. .. the boycott and a ll the 
other issues can be lumped 
into one thing: the general 
apat hetic, non-knowledga ble 
council...1 ob 'erved t hat there 
are two or three people that 
have 'uch a loud vo ice and ar 
so a ffluent...All the (ot her) 

pie on the counci l are 
gett i ng influ enced by t heseone 
or two people who have thei r 
leftist views which I don't 
thi nk all the student · do 
have," he said . 
A differing view 

Pam Gerber. Commisioner 
of External Affairs, and Linda 
Saba, Cha irperson of the 
Stu dent Body's Pres ident 
Council , feel that Tollner is 
ta king hi' issue' out of 
context. 

"I thin k its real legiti mate to 
ask or expect t he A to be 
represent at ive of students," 
Sabo said after the Tuesday 

night meeting. " But , the 
problem is, what does that 
mean? What student · are you 
representing? How do you find 
out what the students think? 

"(If someone were to say 
th at the A should be more 
representative) I'd say that 
everyone on t he AS wou Id be in 
total agreement ," Sabo added. 

Gerber feels that students 
who showed up at Tollner" 
meeting don't unders tand 
what the AS is try ing to do. 

" If we have rallies on US 
involvement in icaragua and 
EI Sa lvador, th y don't think 
it's directly relevant to them. 
It 's the AS 'overs tepping its 
bound " . But when all of a 
sudden t hat involvement (i n 
Latin America) serves as a 
catalyst for Reagan to call for 
the draft to be enact ed, it 
suddenly effects them. It" 
very direct," Gerger said . 

Furt h ermore, Gerber 
accused Tollner of " 'eeing the 
issues and only the issues .... I 
th ink what he's doing is going 
to cert ain student organiza-
tions t hat have a large number 
of people and says: 'You're not 
getting your money. And the 
rea:on you're not getti ng your 
money is becau e of thi . one 
issue (C WO). Defend your-
selves and be on my side.' 

" It's rea lly easy to do that. I 
can go over to the Woman's 
Center and say: 'You're not 
getting suffi cient funding 
because the ski clu b is getting 
too much money ... ,''' Gerber 
said. 
'A typical student' 

Tuesday night's meeting 
was intended to organize t he 
support of 't he typical student' 
- the students of UC D who 
don't usually take par t in 
·t udent politics but who want 
a say in the is ·ues. 

Margot Gordon, a sopho-
more who has never attended 
an AS meet ing before, came to 
Tollner's meeting because: "} 

rea lly got fru strated. I don't 
think it's the job of student 
government to be doing all 
these political thing. I don 't 
think they shou ld be spending 
our money so freely." 

Tollner, who 'aid he "did 
expect a few more individuals" 
to show up at Tuesday night' . 
meeting, say ' he plan ' ony to 
change one issue - the 
funding of CWO's film series 
- by a petition. The rest of his 
demands, Tollner says, will be 
carried out by demontrating 
that the student body is behind 
him. Tollner encouraged the 
people who attended Tuesday 
night's meeting to organIze

' 'I'm nol planning on

Playing with atomic fire: 
nuclear arms discussions 

By JOE FALLETTA 
Negol inl ions concerning I he

proceeded in I he right 
direct ion ov er I he pa~t :~6 

year ~, according to Dr. Herbert 
York, director of the llC San 
Diego prOhrram i n ~cien ce, 
technology and public affairs 
and gm ernment advisor and 
nuclear talks negotiator. 

But York added ta lks have 
not amounted to much in light 
of the dras ti c alternati ve 
involved, 

York . a former chancellor of 
UC San Diego, a research 
phys icist who worked on the 
government ' · Manhattan 
Project to create the first 
atomic bomb and a member of 
a number of government 
advisory comm ittees on 
nuclear weapons development 
and controL wa ' one of five 
speakers in a two- night class 
s po n ' ored by the UC 
Extens ion last week entit led . 
"Can a ucl ea r War Be 
Pre\ ented ?" 

York opened the class wilh 
an overv iew of nu clear arms 
cont ro l npgol iat ions si nce I he 
end of World War Two. He 
explai ned thaI, although the 
t\\'o major nuclear powers, the 
llnited Stales and I~u ss ia , 
were and continu c to be 
ser ious abou t crcat ing a 
workable ar ms cont rol treat \" 
the two parties hal'e differed 
tJll one major i:--suc. While the

proliferat ion fir~t and then 
plan t hc diminat ion of nuclear 
\1 eap()n~, the SOl ieb \\ ant the 

rel ' er~e order. The problem 
rcmain~. even today. 

Nuclear disarmamenl began 
wi t h the Baruch Plan afl er the 
war . York said I he plan 
creal eel an Ifltcrnat ilmal IXJdv 
\\'hich \\'ou ld own all nuclea-r 
facilitie!>, mine~, factories and 
nuclear weapons. The plan 
was a major threat to 
sovereignt y, he said . 

"The world would not be 
ready for it now and it 

certa inl y wa..; not ready for It 
Ihen ," York 'l aid . 

Thc Crolllyko plan \\ llll'h

through t he Berlin Blockade 
and the Korean War. They 

re~lImed agai n wi th the 
elect ion of President Dwight 
Ei senho\\er and the ri se to 
power of Premier Kruschcv. 

York !>aid he believes the 
two leaders were s incere in the 
belief t hat a nuclear war must 
be prevenled. Again , however, 
th e two sides differed in which 
should come firs t, the control 
organizat ion or disarmament. 

The first s tep forward came 
with the flight of Sput nik . The 
fir ' t s atellite surprised 
everyo n e but Ameri ca n 
intelligence . York said. 
Ei senhower set up a new 
commission to study nuclear 
weapo ns control replacing the 
old commission of pro-nuclear 
hardliners wit h t hose from the 
broader repr sent at ion. 

York, a mem ber of that 
commiss ion in 1957, said the 
body agreed a test ban was 
gwd for the l lnitetl State" and 
th f(llIowing year met with 
Ru ss ion negot iator s in 
Cene\ a. S"itzerland , What 
folluwed was a moratorium on

Nuclear warfare: will 
there be a morning after? 

BY JOE FALLETTA 
Are we going to blow up t he 

world over t he last twenty or 
thirt y years of oil ? 

The ques tion was posed by 
Dr. Pau l Ehrl ich las t week in 
the 'econd of two lectures 
entit led , "Can a Nuclear War 
Be Prevented?" srXlIl sored by 
UC E xtens ion . 

E hrli c h , professo r of 
Population Biology at tanford 
Uni vers ity to ld the 60 or so 
st ude nt s on hand, " ft is 
depress ing they are ta lking in 
Was hi ngton about fighti ng a 
nice w in -abl e s ma ll -sca le 
nucl ear war. " He viewed as 
" in co mpetent Iy optimis tic" 
government s tudies which 
'how some humans might 
surv ive a nucl ear war . One 
s tudy, he s aid , stated "on ly 
150 million Americans wou ld 
be 10 .t. " 

Eh rlich wa ' one of fi ve 
speakers last week to speak on 
such top ics as arms control 
negot iat ion ', pas t and present , 
the e ffects of a thermo- nuclear 
war on the populat ion and the 
environment and s t rategie. 
for bringi ng abou t world 
disarmament. Ehrlich and Dr. 
Gene Rochlin spoke on t he 
wurld wide effects of a n uclear 
war and t he mora lit y and 
'itrategi e~ of the doct r ines of 
nuclear war. 

E h r Ii c h ex am i n ed t h e 
problem of forest fires in Los 
Ange les 10 illu st r a t e th e 
effects on surv iwlrs of a

In winter. the heavy rains

the bla:-.t into the ocean. 

"I\ny :-.un i\'ors whu made 
theIr wa\' to the ocean would 
find them~eh'es in pretty 
tough shape once they got 
there," he said. 

The blas t would creat e 
firestorms s imi lar to the one in 
Ha mburg , Germany in World 
War II , a lthough on a mu ch 
la rger scale. The fi restorm 
the re burn ed fi ve squ are 
mi les , sending flam es 50 feet 
into the air. The gases and 
s moke rose 40,000 feet and 
winds reached 150 mile ' an

with them . T emperatures

burned those in s ide. The 
corpses remained so hot they 
bur ·t into fl ames when t he 
doors were opened by rescue 
personnel.

nothing left to fer ti li ze it. 

"Cons idering t he effects of 
the blas t , any not ion is 
prepos terou ' that survivor ' 
would make it th rough the 
winter or, if they did make it, 
t hat l hey would make it 
through t he next su mmer. 

"There would be no seeds to 
plant crops. Were t here any 
seeds. they would be hybrids 
created for specia l ferti lizers 
and pest icides." 

Dr. Gene Rochlin, a 
consultant on nuclear waste 
managagement and non -
nuclear prol iferat ion, added 
t he nuc lear blast would 
destroy all communication:-.. 
transistor, and micro -
electronic devices. C()mpllter~ , 
cal culators, transistor ignit ion 

system~, power hrrids and 
televi"ions, would be wiped 
out by a high altitude bias\. 

" [f we reall y feel nuclear 
\\arisonthewaY,whyar we 
mm'ing more and more to a 

pos ition of vu lnerabili ty?" he 
as ked. 

Ehr lic h h ypot hes ized a 
nuclear war in w hich both 
sides fired everyt hing it had 
and on ly one percent of that 
went off. Rochlin 's vi w was of 
a wa r in wh ich mi litary 
facil ities were targeted leaving 
civilian populat ions alone. T he 
idea is as credi ble as one of 
" hi t tin g t h e Gene r al 
Dynamics plant a t the ai rport 
and leaving t he rest of San 
Diego untouched ," he said. 

" If only production faci lities 
in Moscow were h it, a 
radiat ion contour would be set 
up t hroughout t he city and 
radiation levels wou ld reach 
5, 00 0 Rads," Roch l in 
ex pl ained . 
"Afler 5,000 Rads you usually 
don't get up." 

[n a conven tional war. 
however, R')ch lin said the 
people k ill ed by radiation don't 
die quick ly enough so they 
stop shoot i ng. The more 
classic use. such as the one 
used in Japan at t he end of 
World War [I. is t he one where 
everyone i:-. killed or, "You 
tOllch me and [ ' 11 kill 
everyone." 

BUI is it more rat ional to 
plan a tact iral nuclear war in 
advance? To kill 30 million 
people in Europe and 'a\'e the 
Western Hemisphere? In an 
era w hen bot h sides can 
annihilate each other, 
planning a ~maller war offers 
an alit, Rochlin said, an option 
other than losing face and 
back ing down when that 
critical POil1t in negotiations is 
reached . 

''These people really Ix .. lic\·e 
\\ hat the y are ~ a yin g ... 
Rochlin "aId, "much in the 
\\ a\ t h(> person who said. 'We 
had 10 de~troy the \'illage to

The first half of the program 
consisted of a quartet by 
Haydn and one by Schu bert. 
The Ha ydn piece was 
un expec t ed l y gay and 
vigorous, com ing from a man 
whose music s upposedl y 
makes Mozart's look r volu· 
tionary by compari:on. While 
s till fully ensconced in the 
clas ·ica!. rather than the 
romantic era, the compo ' ition 
is vigorou~ and bold . wh ich is 
how the quartet performed it. 

The second half of the 
program co n s i sted of 
Norwegian national composer 
Edward Grieg's onl y string 
quartet. The whole quartet is 
built upon one beautiful 
melody. and the romanticism 
of t he piece could have reached 
maudlin proportion s in a more 
energet ic interpret ation . But 
the Guarneri groups did not 
overplay. performing the piece 
with a n understated quality 
whi h made the Grieg work

romanti cism of the piece, its

team pu 'hed ever·dominant UCLA 
to a national championship, and 
then turned around the following 
year and blew past the Bruins and 
Long Beach tate to win their own 
national title. the sport of power 
volleyball has sudden Iy emerged as 
a legitimate activity in the eye - of

The Case for 
Genera l Management 

Am ong the vari ous leading 
business schools, the re is a diver-
sity of programs available , Some 
require th e student to choose a 
major su ch as marke ting or 
finance or any of a number of 
other fun ctional areas. In some 
programs il is possible to evade 
certain areas, the understanding 
of which is essential to the gen· 
e ral manager. 

The MBA curriculum of the 
Tuck School emphasizes breadth 
of learning and offers basic in· 
struction in each of the major 
areas of business administration . 
The first ·year courses, required 
of all degree candidates, include 
work in o rganization structure 
and human behavior, marketing, 
operations analysis and manage· 
ment , economics, accounting and 
finance , industrial relations , 
probability theory . stalistics . 
computers, and business environ· 
ments . In the second year . 
Business Policy. the only required 
course. tics together the learning 
of the first year . The eleven reo 
maining electives may be selected 
from many cou rses in various 
fields . No major or concentralion 
is required , but there is ample 
opportunity 10 study in depth such 
a reas as accounting, financia l 
management. marketing and 
organizalional behavior. 

The Tuck gradua te is flexible; 
he Or she has the skills required 
for entry· level positions in the 
major fun ctional areas as well as 
the broad understanding of busi-
ness esse ntial to the general 
manager.

When the guys at Miller asked me to 
write an ad on writing. I said, "Forget it. 
Not even if you held a gun to my head:' So 
they held a bottle of Lite Beer to my mouth. 

They 're a pretty persuasive group. 
THUGS TO MUGS 

If you're going to write anything, know 
what you're talking about. And that means 
three things: Research, research , and 
more research . The more you know, the 
more you can tell your reader. 

Take my characters. A lot ot them I 
base on actual people. There's this buddy 
of mine who pops up in every book I write. 
In one story he 's a cop. In another, a pri· 
vate eye. Once, I made him a millionaire. 
Using him not only helped make character 
development a heck of a lot easier, he was 
so carried away by the rich image, he 
bought me a lot of free dinners (and a lot ot 
Lite Beer trom Miller). So use the people 
you know as models. 

Even locations should be based on 
real th ings. If you 're writing about a bar, 
know that bar. Hang out there . Watch the 
bartender. The customers . Whatever 
they drink, you drink. When they drink 
Lite Beer, you drink Lite Beer. Re-
member- research is most fun when 
you soak up as much subject matter as 
you can. It can only help you paint a 
better picture. 

II, DOll 
No caper IS complete w ithout dames 

(or ladies in proper English). Experience 
has shown me that in mystp.ry Writing. the 
sexier the dames, the better. Experience 
has also shown me that sexy scenes make 
great puncluation marks. This is where 
research has the greatest potential. Use 
your own discrelion in this matter. But 
when you write about it, don 't be too 
explicit. That way, your reader gels to paint 
a more vivid picture. 

(APER TO PAPER 
O.K. , you've got your characters. loca-

lions, and dames lined up. Now comes the 
good part: Putting your caper to paper. 
There's no mystery to it. As 10nQ as you 
write the ending tirst, the rest Will follow. 
Write short, terse, to-the-point sentences. 
Be as clear as possible. And make sure 
you've got the right stuH around for when 
you get thristy. After all , writ ing is pretty 
thirsty work . 

I suggest a couple of mugs of Lite 
Beer- who ever heard of a caper that 
didn 't involve a couple of mugs? 

Why Lite Beer? It's a lot like me and my 
books- great taste , less filling (some 
people can't get their till of my books), and 
always good to spend time with . 

At any rate , follow my advice and, who 
knows-you mi!;}ht turn out a heck of a 
story. Or you might turn out 10 be a heck of 
a Lite Beer drinker.
