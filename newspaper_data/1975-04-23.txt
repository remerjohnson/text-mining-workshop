Collective Bargaining 
Jumps First Hurdle 

By Maura Dolan 
Secr.mento Correspondent 

'Sometimes' Emerges as "Open Forum" 
A vigorously-oppo d bill establishing collectIve bargainIng lor 

univerSIty and other public employees with amendments to permIt 
student participation in negotiations narrowly overcame Its f,rst 
legislative hurdle yesterday . 

The Senate Committee on Governmental OrganIzation voted 6-5 to 
approve the bill and 9-2 to accept student lobby-authored amend-
ments . by Craiglackson 

S1IIff Writer 
A new publication has ap-

peared on campus this quarter . Its 
name is "Sometimes," and it has 
been described as anything from 
an "open forum" for students to a 
"mouthpiece for the Student 
Cooperative." 

"Sometimes" comes out every 
Monday. Although it can be 
found at key locations around 
campus, the preferred method of 
d i stribu tion is hand-to-hand . 
Since only 2,000 copies are 
printed, the editors of 
"Sometimes" have urged that 
those who have read it should 
pass it on to frie~s . 

"Sometimes" has been ci-
ficia lly recognized as a subsidiary 
journal by the UCSD Com-
munications Board, and as such it 
is receiving the standard sum of 
$435 in support this quarter. It is 
print~d by the Printing 
Cooperative, and many members 

of the Sometimes statt also work 
for the Print Coop as volunteers . 

Political Orientation 
Steve lopez, one of the writers 

for "Sometimes," admits the 
journal shows a definite political 
orientation . He noted that 
politically active people on 
campus tend to be involved in a 
number .of different activities at 
once - hence the fact that four 
members of the Sometimes 
collective also hold important 
positions in the Student 
Cooperative. 

lopez stressed, however, that 
' absolutely anyone can submit 

articles or letters to "Sometimes." 
He also mentioned that poetry 
and humorous pieces are very 
welcome. lopez said that anyone 
who attends two out of three 
editorial meetings can have a 
vote in determining "Sometimes" 
editorial policy. The meetings are 
held Fridays at 4:00 in the Student 
Center.

Deadlines Near for 
Creative Writing Efforts 

by Nancy Hocilon 
I1aff Witter . 

UC San Diego, renowned for 
accomplishments in the sciences, 
has germinated three new literary 
journals this quarter which are 
now accepting contributions 
from writers on campus . 

"Fourthwrite" is a publication 
funded and composed by th~e 
;nvolved with the Fourth College 
Program. Its goal is to expose 
students' writing to both criticism 
and praise from the rest of the 
campus, according to its editors . 
Any ideas for a cover design and 
contributions should be sub-
mitted to Hl 135 within the next 
week . literary work should be 
typed double-spaced, with any 
incriminating names or locations 
changed . This is necessary due to ' 
some of the subjects discussed by 
Fourth writers . Help in layouts, 
typi ng and editing, is also being 
ought. 

"Helicon is a, poetry journal, 
representing all types of poetry 
from students, faculty , 
secretaries, custodians; anyone 
who would like to submit work. 
There is a four poem limit per 
person and th'e due date is April 
30. 

"Helicon" was inspired by Ed 
Fussell's poetry class, founded by 
Suzy Hansen, funded by the 
Communications Board, and now 
is followed through by Julie 
Wiant and larry Krammer. 

Helicon's 500 copies will be 
printed In mid-May and sold for 
25 cents at the Muir literature 
Office and Revelle Plaza. 

Julie Wiant 

The editors ask that poems be 
typed on 8" x 11" paper with 
name, address and phone at the 
top of each sheet. Persons in-
terested in working on "Helicon" 
next year are asked to contact 
Julie Wiant in the Muir literature 
Office. 

"Manna" is a journal accepting 
not only fiction and poetry, but 
art work and photography from 
"anyone who has something 
interesting to express ." "Manna" 
is striving to fill a void and create 
an impression in the minds of 
students and professors alike, 
according to its organizers . 

The Comm. Board has alotted 
five hundred dollars to "Manna" 
for the rest of this year . "Manna" 
hopes to receive thirteen 
thousand dollars next year . 

lopez described "Sometimes" 
as a "written open forum" that 
will hopefully appeal to students 
enough that they wi II want to 
contribute their own articles . He 
said he hoped " Sometimes" 
would "awaken more people to 
some of the trips that are being 
laid down on them by the 'powers 
that be '." " Sometimes" has 
printed lengthy articles dealing 
with the proposed University 
Town Centre and North City West 
land developments, as well as an 
interview with Chancellor 
McElrov. 

"Mouthpiece" 
Critics of "Sometimes" feel it to 

be a " mouthpiece for the Coop." 
They cite a front-page article in 
the third issue of "Sometimes" 
that spoke in favor of the 
mandatory Campus Activit ies Fee 
and the Student Cooperative. 

One issue currently 
su rrou nd ing "s 0 metimes " 
centers on the recent Election 
Board ruling that no part of the 
mandatory fee money can be 
used in campaigning for next 
week 's stu dent referendum . 
However, Steve lopez pointed 
out the fact that "Sometimes" is 
legally permitted to take a stand 
on the referendum or any other 
issue by virtue of its official status 
as a subsidiary journal. 

The amendments would permit a non-voting student representatIve 
to negotiate labor provisions with University employees and the 
administration . 

The bill would entitle public employees, from unIversIty professors 
to city firemen, to bargain collectively for wages, working hours and 
fringe benefits . 

Public employees currently can " meet and confer" with their em-
ployers, but employers need not listen to labor's requests . 

The approved bill, termed a "Trojan horse" by opponents, differs 
sharply from its original version . 

In response to criticism during public hearings last week from more 
than 40 groups, the bill's author, Senator Ralph Dills(D-los Angeles), 
stripped the legislation of proviSions giving public employees the right 
to strike and requiring labor to undergo complicated impasse 
procedures . 

Dills also amended the bill to make public within 24 hours any 
changes or new proposals in the course of negotiations and to exempt 
already-unionized transit workers, a change sought by the California 
Federation of labor, AFL-CiO. 

Most legislators here view the amendments as a necessary com-
promise to obtain committee approval of the bi II . 

Senate Minorty leader George Deukmejian(R-long Beach) said last 
week that under the measure's unionizing provisions, "essentially 
every public employee in California will be forced to join a union or 
organization as a·condition of employment by his own government." 

Gene Darling, a member of the executive board of American 
Federation of State, labor, County and Municipal Employees local 
1695, said the bill's amendments do not forbid public emproyee . 
strikes; they just don' t legalize them . 

'We can still strike," he said. 
local 1695 includes non-academic and academically-employed 

workers at UC Berkeley . 
Student lobbyist Thomas Delapp said the bill would entitle part-

time stud~nt employees at the University to collective bargaining. 
But Darling called the bill 's language "so vague" that courts could 

easily deny student employees bargaining rights . 
When asked why "Some'times" " In every state except one that has collective bargaining," he said, 

was started, lopez indicated that "s tudents, since they were hired because they were students, were not

A ti-Coop Tactics Discussed Noted Libertarian Rothbard to Speak by C ail Uchida 
WrIIIr 

The actiolls of the anti -
Student Cooperative forces in 
regard to t~ referendum election 
this week '¥as a primary point 
discussed at the Coop meeting 
Monday night. 

Varying viewpoints centered 
around the campaign of the 
Students for Voluntary Action 
(SV A) agai nst the mandatory fee 
and the Student Coop itself. 

The 'Wipe The Grin ... " posters, 
allegedly' by the SVA, were the 
subject for discussion during the 
time allocated for comments . 

I twas stated that certain 
election code violations may 
have occurred because of the 
posters and that complaints 
should be submitted to the 
election board which · would 
investigate such allegations . The 
charges brought forward by 
individuals were discussed 
yesterday at 5 pm by the Board. 
The decision was not available at 
press time. 

In other areas, Garrett Cruener 
expressed concern fOr the lack of 
action , involvement and initiative 
centered around the Student 
Center AdviSory Board. Cruener 
reasoned that the student center, 
having been constructed, 
maintained, and funded through 
student fees should be managed 
by students . 

The Student Center Advisory 
Board at the present time is made 
up of students from the four 
colleges, bu t according to 
Gruener and Marco LiMandri , the 
students have failed to become 
involved aggressively. Gruener 
felt that the board was not 
fulfilling its day to day assign· 
ments and sought a means to 
correct this problem ._

"No Motivation" 10 Card's 
LiMandri indicated that there is 

"no motivation by the students" 
and " that administration is 
making most of the major 
decisions." In order to right this 
wrong, and shift administrative 
power into the hands of the 
students, it was suggested by 
Gruener that the Coop appoint a 
task group to aid the Advisory 
Board. 

"Grave fi nancial prob lems" 
have curtailed the im· 
plementation of permanent 
student identification cards. This 
fact was disclosed by Lincoln 
Cushing in a letter from Chan-
cellor McEl roy . I n this letter, 
McElroy expressed his thanks to 
the Coop for their concern for 
student affai rs and their survey 
taken earlier in the year.

Bargaining •.. 
Continued from Pale 1 

UC Vice-president for Governmental Relations Jay Michael con-
firmed Darling's prediction . 

Michael said the University will seek to exclude part·time student 
workers who are employed because of their student status (such as 
teaching assistants) from the measure. 

The University. will also try to amend the bill to forbid student 
participation in negotiations, he said . 

Sen . James Wedworth([Hnglewood) carried the student amend-
ments . 

" If students are eliminated from collective bargaining, we will be 
eliminating good, valuable participation," he told the committee . 

Sens. Dills and Randolf Collier(D-Yreka) opposed the student 
amendments. 

Dills said his bill already adequately protected students and that 
students should not receive rights "above those given to the ta)(·paying 
public." 

Chairman of the Academic Council Ale)(ie Maradudin, contacted 
before the committee, said the UC faculty opposes student par· 
ticipation in bargaining and would "probably" oppose the bill if 
amended to include students. 

Darling said most labor organizations also oppose a student at the 
bargaining table out of fear that mani\8ement would use a student to 
fight unions. 

Under the amended measure, UC employees would be required to 
negotiate directly with the Board of Regents rather than the governor-
a provision all parties involved seem to support . 

Joining Dills in voting for the amended bill were Democratic Sens. 
Arien Gregorio of San Mateo, Joseph Kennick of long Beach, George 
Zenovich of Fresno and John Dunlap of Napa. 

Collier was the only Democrat to vote against the bill. 
The Senate Finance Committee must approve the bill before it goes 

to the Assembly. .

Acting Company to Perform 
Comedy Classic Saturday 

When a .Broadway play is not going well in rehearsal, the producers 
often ca ll In someone to help re·write or direct it. In theater jargon he 
is a "play doctor ." 

The first of all play doctors may have bEoen the renowned Dr. Oliver 
Goldsmith. A man who turned from mediCine to writing· and who gave 
the English language one of its classic novels with "The Vicar of 
Wakefield" . Goldsmith diagnosed that the "Comic Muse" of the 
theater was "a~ying," and he set out to cure her . The medicine he 
prescribed hilS been making people laugh ever since, under the title of 
"She Stoops to Conquer ." 

San Diego audiences may take the doctor's comic cure on April 26 
and 27 when the City Center Acting Company under the auspices of the 
Campus Program Board offers its sprightly production of "She Stoops 
to Conquer" in the Mandeville Center Auditorium. 

When Goldsmith wrote the play in 1773, the Comic Muse had 
contracted an unusual disease: tears. Comedy had become "sen· 
timentaL" Playwrights strove to teach moral lessons and to present 
such affecting spectacles of duty, sacrifice , etc . that audiences would 
weep as the curtain fell . Goldsmith wrote an essay calling for a return 
to " laughing comedy," and proceeded to show what he meant by that 
with "She Stoops to Conquer." (In the Prologue to the play, an actor 
comes out sobbing Over Comedy's illness, and asks the audience to 
" swallow" the doctor's potion"· the play· so the Muse can be cured .) 

Subtitled "The Mistakes of a Night," the play tells the story of a 
you ng man who is painfully shy with well-bred girls but not with their 
inferiors . On his way to meet the girl his father wants him to marry he is 
led to mistake her home for a. country inn, and the girl "stoops to 
conquer" him and his shyness by pretending to be a barmaid . The 
mistakes of the night are further complicated by a pair of frustrated 
lovers trying to elope, and by a mischievous lad who makes his doting 
mother believe he has driven her 40 miles from home when she is 
actually back on her own doorstep. 

The actina company evokes the innocent, merry world of " She 
Stoops to Conquer" with a p.roduction that looks like actual plays of 
the period . The setting, designed by Robert U. Taylor, is a "Stage within 
a stage," where scenes are announced by a series of brightly painted 
backdrops, and the action moves to the harpsichord accompaniment 
of " tunes" by Handel, as arranged by musical director , Gerald 
Gutierrez. 

"The play is more of an experience of happiness," says director 
Porter, " than of simply being funny. It's a bit like some of 
Shakespeare's romantic comedies with the mixture of poetic moments 
and things that are silly What do I hope the audience will feel? I think 
they will want things to turn out well , and to be pleased that they do -
that the characters get what they want. The play is about overcoming 
obs tacles that we can all identify with. I think that the audience will 
feel·· gladness."

That is not an emotion in which playwrights seem to deal any longer. 
If Goldsmith were diagnosing the comedy of today, he surely would 
find most of it cynical and bitter. 

The City Center Acting Company, which has been acclaimed by 
critics for its style and versatility, is the only permanent professional 
company in the country which tours classic and modern plays in 
repertory . Now in its third season, the group was founded by producer-
director John Houseman who serves as artistic director. 

Tickets which may be purchased at the box office in the student
