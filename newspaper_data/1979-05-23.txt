Former Agent Calls 
For CIA EI im i nation 

By Pat Domowitz 
Staff Writer 

" The CIA has dug us a deep 
hole (in world opinion) and 
continues to do so. The United 
States would do much better if 
we had the courage to close it 
down today," a former CIA 
official told about 50 listeners 
here yesterday. 

John Stockwell was Angola 
Task Force leader for the 
Central Intelligence Agency in 
1975-76, just before he ended his 
12-year agency career with a 
disillusioned resignation, and 
burned the bridges a year later 
by writing a highly critical 
book, In Search of Enemies. 

AlthQugh the Hoover Report 
on the National Security Act, 
which created the CIA in the 
late 40s, acknowledged that 
some of the philosophy behind 
the new agency might be 
repugnant to American ideal , 
Stockwell said, " there- is 
nothing repugnant about that 
philosophy to the sort of people 
attracted (0 the CIA," noting 
that agency membership gives 
operatives unrestrained power. 

He quoted Col. Gt!Orge White, 
the man who directed CIA drug-

control experiments. 
Upon his retirement, he said, 
bite wrote to a colleague: 
"I toiled wholeheartedly in 

the vineyards because it wa 

fun , fun , fun . Where else could a 
red-blooded American boy lie, 
kill . cheat, steal , rape, and 
pillage with the blessings of the 
highest?" . 

Stockwell called for the 
abolition of the agency, saying 
it presented a " violent option 
for the president in foreign 
affairs. a source of plausible 
denial, a secret army. 

It circumvents the checks 
and balances that are essential 
to a democracy, and two recent 
proposals - the essential 
elimination of the Hughes-
Ryan Act accountability and 
the outlawing of any public 
release of agents ' names -
would provide the agency with 
total freedom from those 
check a nd balance , he aid . 

Stockwell recounted his own 
career in the nation' " secret 
police- formed on the model of 

talin's KGB" - from its start 
with his recruitment (rom the 
Marine Corps, wher~ he served 
a an officer. 

"At the beginning they dOll ' t 
tell you about the marginal, 
stupid and depraved practices 
that have become public 
knowledge during the last 
decade," he said. "In fact, they 
never tell you.

Letters to the Editor 

PrQvost Remark Appalls 
Editor: 

I feel It is my obligation to 
respond to the recent 
comments of Provost Joseph 
Watson. I find his comment: 
"Students should feel lucky 
they have the right to vote at 
all" for the permanent name of 
Third College appalling. He has 
obviously not acted for the good 
of the students of Third College. 
If Joseph Watson were a white 
man it would be disgusting; but 
him being a Black man 
proliferates this disgust to the 
point of intolera bility . The 
students of Third want Third as 
a permanent name and the 

right to vote about it is neither 
privilege nor a matter of luck. I 
am a Black man and I don't 
consider myself "lucky" to be 
able to use the same bathroom 
or any other facility as a white 
man . I am entitled to that. How 
quickly we forget Mr. Black 
Provost. Fifteen short years 
ago things were not equal (and 
they still aren't) and you 
making a comment like "It 
would be a lot more efficient to 
have Third College adminis-
trators vote on the name" 
C\isturbs me to no end. It would 
have been a lot more efficient 
for Blacks never to have been 

Saltman PRofiled 
Editor: 

Till reading your Saltman 
profile, we were not entirely 
convinced that you had gone 
into the public relations 
business. Now we all rest 
assured knowing that tenure 
decisions and academic 
integrity In general rest in the 
grasp of such a first-rate mind, 
with such an expansive world 
view. That 's assuming, of 

course, that the quotes were 
accurate and in context (quite 
an assumption based upon your 
track record) . 

In any event, it's unfortunate 
Saltman didn 't get the Texas 
job. Had he achieved non-
California residency, Jerry 
Brown might have happily 
found a philosophical equal to 
take as his running mate.

'Suffering~ 
Preferred 
To Center 
Editor: 

According to the San Diego 
Union (Thursday, May 17, 
1979), our chancellol' says that 
the UCSD campus "suffers " 
[rom having no nearby 
shopping center. He and his 
Board of Overseers propose 
that a "small" center near 
Third College would greatly 
benefit the campu . 

Would someone please 
correct my memory (or refre h 
McElroy's) but wasn't that the 
same reason that the campus 
capitulated to the development 
of the La Jolla Village Shopping 
Center? And later again to the 
University Towne Centre? In 
each of these cases, the 
objections of faculty and 
students were overridden by 
the chancellor'S deep coll<:ern 
for our shopping convenience. 

What convenience? Although 
McElroy lives in 'the nearby La 
Jolla Farms, most of the 
campus population commutes 
from communities where there 
are, also, shopping centers. 
Does even McElroy need three 
nearby shopping centers? 
Furthermore , we have no 
reason to believe that another 
so-called college center would 
be anything other than 
overpriced delicatessens, shoe 
stores. jewelry stores and gift 
shops. 

In thi proposed center, we 
would be deprived of the riding 
stables and the half block field 
through which one strolls on the 
way to the beach. In six years. 
we have lost most of the 
natural, open space around us. 
(Believe it or not. deer and 
foxes were observable within a 
fi(teen minute walk from 
campus.) Let us not tolerate 
anymore encroachment upon 
what little beauty remaulS near 
thecampu .

UN Sees Energy 
Millenium in Ta.f 
Third World Offered Thousand 
Years Before Sands Run Out 
(Ted Morello writes on Third World and United Nations affairs for me 
Loni1o,..bosed Gemini News Service and several U.S. papers.) 

By Ted Morello 
Pat'iric New. St>r\'i~ 

The United Nations, dismissing a larmist forecasts that we 
are running out of oil, is organizing the "first international 
conference aimed at harnessing the ~orld's vast deposits of 
heavy crude and tar sands. By even c:onservative estimates. 
these two sources could yield petroleum to lust 1.000 years. 

According to Joseph Barnea. long regarded as the UN' s .. Mr. 
Energy. " many countries, not only in the Third World. "can 
become independent oC petroleum imports." 

In 22 years oC UN service, Bamea buill the organization's 
Centre for Natural Resources and Energy from scratch. Since 
retirement he has been senior fellow at the UN Training 
Research Institute (UNITAR) which is organizing the global 
conference, to take place from June 4 through 12 in Edmonton. 
Canada. 

The conference aims to highlight the probubility thut many 
countries with little or no known petroleum resources may in 
fact be "beggars sitting on thrones of gold." 

Tar sands and heavy crude, which Barnea calls "the energy 
of freedom." are low-quality petroleum resources which hl.lve 
remained virtually untouched. even though the technologies for 
extracting and upgrading them have existed for years. 

&rnea said in • .IO interview: "These sources of hydrocurbons 
are litlle known and their potential scarcely recognized even 
where they occur in vast quantities. " 

A recent UN paper said estimates for Venezuela . Cunada and 
the U.S. alone "exceed five trillion barrels - some two to three 
times greater than the world's presently known estimated 
conventional oil. " 

Indications of "substantial" deposits have al 0 been found in 
Peru , Argentina. Angola, Madagascar, th e Soviet Un ion. 
Romania , France . Albania . Trinidad, Nigeria. Britain and 
Italy . 

Even the current rudimentary state of exploration . UNITAR 
says. suggests that " many other developing countries" have 
heavy crude and tar sand deposi ts , found most often in 
sedimentary basins. 

As for industrialized countries, UNITAR points out. 
"signifi cant" disco\'erics of heavy crude htlVe been' made 
recently off Britain's North Sea coas t and in the Adriatic off 
]Wly. The Adriatic find .. Ion i estimated at nearly three 
billion barrels. 

Philippe de Seynes . director of NITAR 's Project of the 
Future. calls the Edmonton conference an attempt to show that 
"there is no need to panic over energy resources for the long 
term." 

De Seynes. formerly UN under secretary-general for 
e(,'onomic and social affair , is involved in a U "think tank" 
for planning into the next century . He says that thc Soviet Un ion 
reports that it has adequate conventioniJl rese rve of ga and oil 
to l<.Is1 beyond the year 2000. 

And at a UN-sponsored energy conference in Austria, Soviet 
scientists reported that estimated crude oil resources could add 
12 trillion barrels , or enough for several l'tmturies . 

In addition, they reckoned that worldwide hydrospheric 
gases (natural gas dissolved in oceans, rivers. l<1kes and 
swamps) contain 350 billion trillion cubic feet of.natural gas - a 
2O-million:year supply. . 

The Edmonton l'Onference is expected to aUract experts from 
over 30 countries. It will review all information avuilableon 'the 
occurrence. exploration and exploitation of he<.lvy crude <u)d 
tar sands . 

Some policy-makers will attend, but most delegates will be 
technical experts: geologists, gl'Ophy sieists, engineers. 
refinery experts. environmental scientists and economists.

STARKE, Fla, (AP)-The scheduled executions of 
condemned murderers John A. Spenkelink and Willie 
Jasper Darden, Jr. were derailed yesterday when 
federal judges granted stays of t!xecutioin to both 
men. 

Spenkelink ' was the second of the two to be 
temporarily spared execution in the electric chair, 
and his reprieve came less ,than seven hours before 
he was scheduled to die. 

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall 
postponed Spenkelink's execution in a ruling issued in 
Washington after two other Supreme Court judges

Meanwhile , ad ministration officials said refineries 
are being asked to boost their gasoline production to 
ease lines at the pump. But these officials insisted that

At Local Hospitals 

Rejected Unions FUe Unfairness Suit 
By Monet Payton 

Sta"Writer 
Complaints of unfair labor 

processes are being filed with 
the National Labor Relations 
Board by a coalition of four 
AFL-CIO affiliated unions after 
service and technical workers 
at two local hospitals rejected 
union membership earlier this 
month. 

A solid majority of em-
ployees from the La Jolla and 
Encinitas Scripps Hospitals 
decided against accepting the 
coalitiods offer of unionization 
in an election held May 11. 

According to Don Willard, 
special representative of the 
RetaU Clerks Union, Local 1222, 
the work done by West Coast 
Indultrial Relations Associa-
tion, a Los Angeles-based labor 

. relations firm hired by Scripps 
Hospitals, was the main cause 
of Jhe election results. 

"They did quite a few things 
that were illegal," Willard said, 
thoUlh declined to elaborate 

further, saying that to do so 
would be the equivalent of 
revealing a battle plan . 

Ames S. Early, president of 
the hospitals, said he was very 
pleased by the outcome. "We, 
the administration and 
mana·gement of both hospitals , 
were and are convinced that a 
solid team of management and 
employees working together 
without the necessary involve-
ment of a third party, the 
unions, is in the best interest of 
everyone concerned," he said. 

"We feel Scripps Memorial 
Hospitals are among-the very 
finest health care facilities 
anywhere and if we enjoy that 
reputation, it is for the most 
part because of the loyalty and 
spirit of our employees, " he 
continued, "and the manage-
ment intends to continue in that 
same tradition." 

WCIRA was also hired by 
Scripps hospitals in March to 
help defeat a proposal that the 
nurses unionize. However, the 

nurses voted to be represented 
by the California Nurses 
Association. ]n a secret ballot 
election the desire for better 
working conditions and wages 
was expressed. Negotiation 
with the CNA has not begun yet, 
according to Early , though 
attempts have been made by 
the hospital to begin nego-
tiating sessions. 

The 566 employees who voted 
Ma y 11 included licensed 
vocational nurses , laboratory 
and radiology technicians , 
engineers , housekeeper and 
dietary employees, physical 
and respiratory therapists, and 
a group of administrative and 
related clerical workers. 

]n order to file their 
complaint, the unrons must

"(The university) claimed 
they had the right to request 
information regarding how our 
stewards were using their 
time," said Stronski. 

Since Graphics employees 
began meeting with AFSCME 
to discuss their problems, 
"feared retaliation" has 
caused job resignation, 
transfers and dismissals within 
the department , said Stronski. 

He said that one union 
employee at Graphics was 
"arbitra rily reassigned" to a 
different location because "he 
stood up for his rights." 

"This was blatant harass-
ment because he's been an 

employee (or 13 years , " 
remarked Stronski. "A lot of 
union employees have been 
passed over for promotion" in 
the past year, he said. 

Peace believes that the 
university is " Cailing to follow 

its own rules in order to bust the

'The Birds' Just 
Highly Territorial 

By Kathy Huffer 
Associate News Editor 

Alfred Hitchcock's horror story of birds attacking residents 
of Northern California's Bodega Bay seems to be repeating 
itself here . 

Students report that several blackbi rds working alone and at 
all hours have swooped down upon them for no apparent 
reason. 

From their perches atop the tall pine trees flanking the 
Revelle sidewalks, the small but determined birds 
indiscriminately choose their victims for another strike. 

"They 're the thrill seekers of the bird world, " commented 
Mark Heckman, a junior at Revelle, who has thus far escaped 
the birds ' attentions but has witnessed numerous attacks. 

While the birds sometimes practice their diving techniques 
by swooping inches near their intended victim, they just as 
often make light contact with their favorite target - peoples' 
heads. I 

" It feels really weird to feel those claws." remarked Warren 
sophomore Claydene Nee, who has had her hair pulled by a bird 
three times since last week. As a result, she now wa lks 
backwards through the birds ' domain to keep a constant 
surveillance on the feathered aggressors. 

According to Art Risser, curator of birds at the San Diego 
Zoo, the attackers are probably Brewer's blackbirds , a species 
whose males are " highly territorial " during each spring's 
nesting season. 

The blackbirds are particularly attracted to people's heads 
because of the head' prominence, said Risser, suggesting 
students wear a hat or flag until the birds ' aggressions subside 
in about a month . 

No one knows how long the bird attacks will continue. Few 
students are hopeful that the birds will be apprehended for 
discipline, for positive identification of the winged criminals 
would be a difficult ta k indeed.

BayOto Breakers Mob Runs for Fun 
San Francisco 
Draws 18,000 

By Jon Halperin 
A celebration. The Streets of 

San Francisco were pounded 
la t Sunday by 36,000 feet in 
what was a tribute to the sport 
of the seventies - running. 
Eighteen thousand runners 
(.'Ompeted in this year's Bay to 
Breakers race: the 68th annual 
migration across the golden 
city. 

The throng of 18,000 was the 
largest turnout of the West 
Coast's biggest footr<lce . For 
five hundred or so it was a race: 
for the remaining 17 ,500. it was 
a grand way to spend OJ Sunday 
afternoon.

that even though we are only 
100 yards from the start, many

impassable human bottleneck.

O'Brien · Keeps Poloists Afloat 
Shooter Anchors First Year Women's Water Polo Club Team 

.,. Je .. Gee&z 
...... SCaff wrber 

". 8I'IIl of Claudia O'Brien 
helped the women's water polo 
team to a 2-2 .pltt in weekead 
play at San Dleto State, closing 
out their first season of play. 

Tbe team collected their first 
victory from the UC Santa 
Barbara B team this season, 6-
3, beblad O'Brien', sbootlnl· 
That pme was an especially 
sati.fylng win, since tile 
Tritou loIt to SB earUer In the 
year. Riverside also fell to 
UCSD,7-a. 

AbeIICI 3-1 over Arizona, the 
eventual third place finisher in 
the aiae-team tournament, 
UCSD slipped and lost 11-3. UC 
Davia also defeated the Tritons, 
7-3. 

Tbil weekend's play ended 
tbe TJitoD's record at five wins 
and DIne losses in their 
premiere .... on. The squad is 
still clMaifled .. a club sport on 
CIlll1pu8, and won't be elilible 
for Inten:olleliate funding until 
1911. Much of the fundlDi for 

team travel to Santa Barbara 
and Los Angelea came out of 
coach Dan Crane's pocket. 

Crane and Dan Eby, both 
sophomore water polo players 
here, volunteered to coach the 
team this spring. Starting with 
18 lirls of varyinl abilities, 
from baving several years of 
water polo experience to just 
possessing basic swimming 
skills, their task of molding a 
competitive team from this 
group was considerable. 

The coaches started with 
basic ball handling skills, and 
entered competition with two 
weeks of such practice. Lately 
the coaches have been working 
on more advanced offenses 
utilizing picks. . 

Crane has been impressed 
with the speed with which the 
women have picked up the 
spGrt. "I remember back when 
I was a sophomore in high 
school just learning the sport. 
What it took us two years to 
learn, they learned in six 

weeks. It helps to work with 
intellilent people," Crane said. 

The team has been shaping 
up with Bunny Stein setting the 
crucial" hole" position in front 
of the goal, O'Brien doing the 
majority of the shooting, and 
Nadine Thompson goaltending. 

"Bunny did a strong job (in 
the hole)," said Crane. " She's 
one of the more level-headed 
players." 

O'Brien, responsible for most 
oC the Triton 's goals this 
season, is one oC two players on 
the team with prior playing 
time. She plays AAU polo in 
Fullerton and also plays on the 
Junior National team. Lori 
Demshki, a diver on the 
women's swim team, also had 
some experience going into the 
season. 

Thompson , also on the 
women's swim team," has been 
super in the goal," said Crane, 
" for someone who had very 
little idea of what to do at the 
beginning of the season." 

UCSD THEATRE 
presents 

Yet the mosl improved 
player, according to the coach, 
was Marin McDonald, who 
played a " heads-up game most 
of the time." 

The other players (Kathy 
Conklin . Kathy Bridges, Karen 
Loftus, Margie Schwartz, Debi 
Bingham, Roberta Lew and Sue 
Zneimer) made up the 
backbone of the team. 

The squad has Quite a bit of 
catching up to do over the 
summer, if they are to be 
competitive with. the more 
established teams in the area 
like San Diego State. 

Crane and Eby also hope to be 
back in the spring for a second 
year oC coaching . Being the 
leader of this sort of team has 
its advantages for them. "It's 
quite an experience," said 
Crane. " Almost like an ego 
trip." 

" When we went to Santa 
Barbara, there were twelve 
girls and me . I wasn ' t 
complaining," he !iaid.

Thirty mile per hour tail

held in Los Gatos. 

The Freshmen Four shell

Jack Vallerga, to earn a silver 
for the Tritons. 

" I knew that they would 
place, but I wasn't rea lly sure 
where," the coach remarked. 

In one of thc better races of 
the wee kend , the Women's 

ovice Eight boat, by far a 
" definite underdog on paper," 
stroked their way to a econd 
place finish behind Santa Clara 
College. 

" Our girls were tiny 
compared to the girls in the 
other shells ," V a llerg a 
explained. " For novices they 
rowed really well. They used 
the t a ilwinds to their 
advantage. Being lighter they 
held Ie s mass toput into motion 

at the sta rl. so they pulled 
ahead to an early le"ld."

(i n I he fi rst heat)," pra ised 
Vallerga. " Our coxswai n 
(Juli an H ... lliday) ke pt the 
othcr boats off balance until wc 

gradually rowed right through 
them. Our boat was so under

a cardboard backdrop that's 
bee n folded four ways, 
suggesting a certain three-
dimensiona lity . As a bl:lc k 
a rtist, Gray has played with the 
images from Uncle Remus 
t a les (known for th e ir 
self-e ffacing jargon and the 
s ubtle ra c is m of s l ave 
altitudes) , intending it as a n 
extended self portrait. 

Commenting on the pieces, 
Gray said, " I wasn 't trying to 
ma ke a gigantic political 
statement. I splattered some 
little pink dolls with black pa int 
a t first , but it never went right. 
The idea was too obvious, not 
distilled. I made the Tar Baby 
pieces ambiguous, not clear , as 
to whether the images .are 
a nima l, monste r, c ute or 
ugly ..... 

Influenced by the decorative 
pa inting styles of Miri am 
Schipiro , Amy Golden and Bob 
Cushner , Gray dealt with 
pattern and background in his 
search for another approach to 
the Tar Baby image. The 
aesthetic effect is appealing, 
and the series retains its 
sociological impact. Says 
Gray, " I want people to enjoy 
the worl'.. Ifthey can't grasp the 
ambiguous image, they can 
still enjoy the pattern." 

In some of the other works , 
Gray became enamored with 
the infant imagery of classy

TIlis is the moral behind A Lillie Romam'e. a motion

Theatre /Bill Gibson 

A Very Funny Thing Happened 
F rom the moment Kip Bas h s links onstage, hunchbacked, sneering 

the infamous opening lines of 
Shakespeare's Richard Ill, a 
barely co ntroll e d rio t of 
activity engulfs HSS 2250. aka 
John Muir Theatre. This riot, 
ostensibly a production of A 
Funny Thing Happened on the 
Way to the Forum, is a joyous 
feast of song and dance and

Thursday through Sund ay 

~venings until June 2. a t 8, 
at the agreeable price of 99¢. 

I don ' t generally like 
musicals those pe c uli ar 

offshoots of European opera: I 
become easily bored. This 
production, however, is so 
quick ly paced , so wittily 
performed and with suc h 
energy a nd joy, that boredom 
was the furthest thing from my 
mind. It was more a question of 
keeping up with the breakneck 
pace of events. The story 
concern the efforts of two 
unlikely Sgana relles . Hys-
terium and Pseudolus. to bring 
a pair of iII·staned lovers 
together. Kip Bash is a t his best 
as the reluct a nt c upid 
Pseudolus. Both,.. he and Mark 
Hardiman (Hysterium) risk

two mercha nts. gesticula te

si ng. . 

These two performances are 
typical of the cast. Throwing 
realism to the wind they 
ca ri cature their roles 
hilariously , taking dramatic 
liberties that only a university 
company WOUld. An example of 
this is Kevin Egan 's Hero: his 
c upidity is so sa ppy , 0 
romantic and dreamy that it 
becomes a parody of its genre. 
All of the staging technique 
seem directed to thi end, from 
the deliberately shoddy and 
hulf-finished set to the 
"i neptitude" of the a tor. 

Director Walter Shoen and the 
cast are playing a riotous joke 
on comedy. in a spirit which 
suits this most irreverent piece 
perfectly . 

Though the production is 
freneti c, it' a finely honed 
affair throughout. The ca t 
staggers and mimics its way 
through Forum with a precision 
which would be a credit to any 
Brecht Repertory. The women 
a r e s tunning , th e men 
bumbling (even lick Rickie 
Slick's mop-top Hercules) , the 
price is right and. a the cast 
belts out at beginning and end. 
"i t 's comedy tonight !" It 
c rtainly is . 

Tapes Are Basis of TV's 'Ambition' 
T v networks are always quick to imitate succes -

re ults ex i ·t within this genrc. 
as ome shows resort tu pure 
speculativc ab urdit ie ("T ile 
Trial of Lce Harvey Oswald "). 
whereas others deal accu ratelv 
with hi s torical matte r ~~ 
(dramatist Stan Greenberg 's 
" The Missilcs of October" ). 
Grecnberg ' s latest excursion 
into histori ca l dramu is "Blind 
Ambitio n . " John Dean ' s 
account of the Watcrga te 
scandal. 

In terms uf (actual accul·a cy.

Greenberg has opted to use the

to delete certai n objectionable 
words) . In addition to the 
transcripts. Greenberg has 
used Dea n ' s book , Blhid 
Ambition, Maureen Dea n's 
book Mo, ond a series of 
interviews with the Deans as 
the basis for his screenplay . 
The end result is an intriguing 
look at political shenanigans 
coupled with the soap opera 
trials and tribulations of the 
Deans' relationship. 

One problem with the story is 
that outside of the faSCina tingly 
absurd maneuvers. the people 
in the White ' House were 

actually quite dull : the Deans ' 
private lifejusl docs not sustain 
mu h interest. 

The scenes dealing with thc 
White House, however . work

fact is at least as sU'il nge as

merchandising - it works fast: 
what Hallmark does to sell 
their merchandise, that's what 
a rtists are doing too, just for a 
different audience." The samll

a nother effect placed in a

Gray's illlcn· .. : in 1) .11 y:; bcli,1 
led him into a tju 'st fo r color 
plate based on b:lby announce 
ments of Lhe Fifties. Obviously 
there a re none depicting 
minority infants of any r<Jce, 
j ust rosy pink cherubs. These 
he uses in collages such as 
Ham's Children, a pink ground 
of cutie pies, infiltrated with 
c harcoa l paint sa mples a nd 
sacchar in angels and moppets 
prints: the whole piece is then 
surrounded with black lace. 

His current works have one 
smooth surface which appears 
to be many textures in collage, 
an effect created byn the use of 
color xerox . This technique 
invokes historical reference to 
Braque 's a nd Picasso's 
Synthetic Cub ism, which 
sugge ted monta,ICes made up

actlw lly were painted, The 
subj ect malle i' for Gray's 
pieces is keepsake portrayal of 
royal families. " Il is important 
that we usc this kind of im· 
agery. It ' part of the cu ltur . 
regarded as schlocky, but it 's 
importa nt we don' t dismiss 
this : it tells us about the 
society," states the artist. He 
has again woven patterning 
into the series, felling the 
pleasure of his audience is 
significant, as did Matisse, who 
is known to have stated that art 
should provide solace fo the 
tired businessm an like a 
comfortable arm chair. Gray

satisfying than minimalism . he

American-born Lauren King 
is a re erved and sheltered girl 
of fair and prelly features . Her 
mother , Kay , has an un-
quencha bl t> thirst for living in 
high swinging society and an 
unbreakable habi t fo r col-
lecting va rious husbands along 
the way . Her current and 
second stepfather, Ri chard, is 
admira bly perseve ring 
man and head of France's ICT. 
Lauren 's idea of a good time is 
casually reading the philo-
ophic writings of Heidecher or 

bemusedly watching the 
childish as tonishment of her 
best friend, Natalie. 

Native Parisian Da ni el 
Mic hon is a n energetic and 
streetwise boy of dark and 
sa uve as pect. His father , 
Michel, is a rambunctious 
brute who takes considera ble 
pride in ripping off unsus-
pecting American tourists of 
their taxi fares . Daniel's 
enjoyment oCthe day consists of 
ogling over the cinematics of 
his heroes, Paul Newman, 
Robert Redford and Humphrey 
Bogart, while restraining his 
promiscuous buddy, Londet, 
from doing the same at the 
femi nine gender. 

The couple have only three 
things in common: both are 
thirteen. semi-geniuses a nd 
sta r crossed. The relation hip 
comes to an abrupt halt after a

ecrelly flee to first Verona and 

then Venice . There, a last·ditch 
attempt is ma de to fortify their 
love by fulfilling a legend of 
fruudulous connotations pun 
by Julius. 

The viewers may mistake A 
LiUle Romancl' as being the 
newe t effort of Francois 
Truffaul. Indeed. the movie 
does pos ess an un ca nny 
resemblance, from its 
concentra tion on children to it 
Eu ropea n setti ngs to the 
E ngli h s ubtitles at it 
beginning. Such reactions 
s ignify how well director 
George Roy Hill has done his 
homework. A bit of Day For 
Night also can be seen in a 
sequence where Hill 's screen 
alter-ego, George, is filming a 
political assassination thriller 
of his own on location.

of the Gypsies' Brooke Shields 
has a formidable competitor in 
the Corm of Diane Lane. The 
latter's role of Lauren Is honest,
