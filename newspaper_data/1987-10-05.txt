UNNERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO MONDAY, OCTOBER 5,1987 

Preliminary probe ofUCSD 
researchers completed 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
News Editor 

A report on allegations of misuse 
offunds by several UCSD scientists 
will be issued in the next few 
weeks, according to an official at 
the National Institutes of Health. 

Howard Hyatt, director of the 
NIH's division of management, sur-
vey and review, said in a phone 
interview that the field work was 
finished on a preliminary investi-
gation of possible wrongdoing by 
four scientists - Dr. Ivor Rovston 
and Dr. Mark Green of the UCSD 
Cancer Center; Dr. john Hans-
brough, director of the San Diego 
County burn center at UCSD Medi-
cal Center; and his colleague, Steven 
Boyce. 

"We have some questions we 
want to bounce off some people 
here at NIH [before we complete 
our reportJ." Hyatt said. He de-
scribed the allegations as referring 
to a possible conflict-of-interest 
concerning researchers using "grant 
funds to start private businesses." 

While none of the doctors in-
volved would return phone calls, 
Leslie Franz of the School of Medi-
cine's Public Affairs office said 
there were, "as far as we know, no 
improprieties" in the connections 
the four scientists had with two 
private biotechnology firms in San 
Diego. According to Franz, an ano-
nymous allegation of wrongdoing 

was made against Dr. Royston. who 
described the charged in a Los 
Angi:/es Times article as "totally false ," 
that he was "incensed about it," 
and called it "harassment." Royston 
was the co-founder of Hybritech, 
Inc., a San Diego biotechnology 
firm sold to Eli LiUy earlier th is year 
for over $600 million dollars. 

The two companies currently 
involved are Idee, Inc. and Clone-
tics. Idee is performing human 
trials of a cal'r.er treatment called 
anti-idiotype antibodies at Stan-
ford University, UCSD, and in 
Seattle. Idee makes the antibodies 
and gives them to Royston for his 
research at the university, accord-
ing to the Times article. William 
Rastetter, president ofIdec, claimed 
that the NIH and other agencies 
are aware of this arrangement, and 
that the university's onflict-of-in-
terest committee was also informed. 

Idee was co-founded last Sep-
tember by, among others, Royston, 
and it employs Dr. Green as an 
adviser. Under investigation, as far 
as these two are concerned, is a 
grant of $143,869 that Royston had 
received to develop monoclonal 
antibodies for cancer treatment, 
and two grants to Green for cancer 
and leukemia research , totaling 
$571,743. 

Other grants the NIH is check-
ing out are two to Hansbrough, 
valued at $442,600 and $384,596. 
Hansbrough works with the fourth 

researcher, Boyce, an assistant ad-
junct professor of surgery at UCSD. 

George Hime, the conflict-of-
interest coordinator at the univer-
sity, said in a phone interview that 
all of the grants except those to 
Royston had been approved. He 
said the review of Royston's grants 
"is present and ongoing ... [it] has 
not been concluded because we 
want to oe thorough about getting 
information and Dr. Royston [who 
has been busy] has not responded 
to aU questions." 

Himsel said that the Fair Politi-
cal Practiced Commission, created 
in 1974 by the passage of Proposi-
tion 9, sets the Slandards by which 
the university'S research review com-
mitteejudges faculty members' affi-
liation with private companies. 

Himel described several criteria 
by which Â£aaIky are judged in 
regard to their connections with 
private industry. First, they must 
disqualify themselves from any de-
cisions regarding their research if 
there is the possibility they may 
profit financially from that deci-
sion. Second, they are judged by 
the standards which the university 
deems appropriate for their field of 
research. Third, the teaching and 
research environment must remain 
open to the free exchange of 
new ideas. Fi!1ally, there must be no 
research done which cannot be 
published and disseminated to 
other researchers. 

Character not so important 
for a president, .survey says 
By GEORGE SKELTON 

WASHINGTON - In chOOSing 
a new president next year, Ameri-
cans say they will be looking for a 
candidate with ability and are far 
less interested in issues, positions 
or personal character, according to 
a poll taken for Times Mirror Co. 

In fact, the subjective quality of 
character - so profusely written 
about and commented on when 
former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart 
and Sen. joseph R. Biden Jr. (0-
Del.) abandoned their candida-
cies- ranks low on the voters' list 
of important qualities for a presi-
dent. 

The survey also indicated that 
voters think the next preSIdent 
should be a Washington insider 
who knows how to "make the 
system work." But niether of the 
two candiates currently leading the 
Democratic pack is a Washington 
in ider. 

In this nationwide poll , taken 

Sept. 1-15. the Rev. jesse jackson 
led the Democratic field propelled 
by overwhelming support from fel-
low blacks and helped significantly 
by white Christian evangelicals. In 
second place was Massachusetts 
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the only 
other Democratic contender whose 
support level reached double digits. 

The results of the survey, taken 
before Biden and Colorado Rep. 
Patricia Schroeder dropped out of 
the race , were jackson, 24%; Du-
kakis, 15%; Missouri Rep. Richard 
A. Gephardt, 7%; Illinois Sen. Paul 
Simon 7%; Tennessee Sen. Albert 
Gorejr., 6%; Biden, 4%; Schroeder, 
3%; former Arizona Gov. Bruce 
Babbitt , 1 %; others . 3% , and 
undecided, 30%. 

In the race for the Republican 
nomination, Vice President George 
Bush led Kansas Sen . Bob Dole by a 
WIde margm. 42 percent to 23 
percent, followed by ew York 
Rep.jack Kemp. 12 percent ; former 

Secretary of State Alexander M. 
Haigjr., 6 percent; television evan-
gelist Pat Robertson, 6 percent; 
former Delaware Gov. Pierre S. 
(Pete) duPont IV, 2 percent; others, 
1 percent, and undecided , 8 per-
cent. 

The poll , taken by The Gallup 
Organization, consisted of 1.903 
telephone interviews, with an error 
margin of 2 percent. 

The survey actually involved fol -
low-up interviews to a much larger 
poll, which was also conducted for 
Times Mirror by Gallup last April 
25-May 10. ln the larger poll, 4,244 
adults were interviewed face to 
face for more than an hour. 

Both surveys, which Gallup called 
'the mo t exhaustive study of the 
American electorate ever underta-
ken : were released here Wednes-
day by Robert F. Erburu. chairman 
and chief executive ffieer ofTimes 
Mirror. whi ch publtshes the Los 
Angele Times.

Survey 
Continued from page 1 

In the lollow-up survey, people 
were asked which single factor 
they gave the most weight to 'w hen 
judging a candidate for President 
- his character, his srand on issues 
or his ability to accomplish things?' 
The responses were abi lity , 49 per-
cent; issues. 33 percent; characte r, 
14 percent, and don't know, 4 
percenr. 

Character ranked second -albeit 
a distant second - only among one 
bloc of Republican voters that Gal-
lup defined as 'Enterprisers: an 
affluem, highly educated, pro-bUSi-
ness group. 

Issues stands ranked as the top 
criterion only among rwo of I I 

voter blocs identified by Gallup: 
'60s Democrats: an upper-middle 

clas~ group srrongly aligned with 
peace, civil righrs and envi ron-
mental causes; and 'Seculars: well-
educaled independents who lean 
Democratic and profess little reli-
gious belief. 

Poor people and those generally 
on the lower end of the income 
scale were especially interested in 
electing a Presidcnt who could 
'accompli sh things.' 

There may have been some dis-
turbing news in the survey for 
Dukakis: By a 3- 1 ratio, the public 
said that serving in Congress 'bener 
prepares someone to be President' 
than being a governor. 

And by a 2-1 ratio, people said 
the next President should 'be some-
one with experience in Washington

presidential candidates on?

who is more likely to know how to 
make the current system work' 
rather than a ca ndidate 'who has 
not worked in Washington and 
who is more likely to change rhe 
way things are now being done .' 

In this survey. however, more 
tangible factors were also obviously 
al work in candidate selection. 
Jackson, for instance, was sup-
ported by 69 percent of blacks 
aligned with the Democratic Party. 
His nearent 'rival' for the backing 

â¢ of blacks was Gore, at a mere 4 
percent. 

Du kakis was the No.1 selection 
of Anglos, who favored him by 1& 
percent to 14 percent overJackson. 
Gephardt gOt 9 percent. But one 
notable exception among Anglos 
was evangelicals, who chose Jack-
son over Gore, 16 percent to 11 
percent. Dukakis was third at 10 
percent. 

Among the Gallup vOter blocs, 
Dukakis fared best with the pre-
dominantly white Seculars, outdraw-
ingJackson 27 percent to 17 per-
cem. He also ran well among '60s 
Democrats but trailed Jackson, 22 
percent to 27 percent. 

Gephardr's best showing came 
. within a bloc that Gallup dubbed 
'Partisan Poor' - heavily Demo-
cratic,low-income, one-third black. 
But this group also was Jackson's 
strongesr. Gephardt ran third at 12 
percent, slighrly behind Dukakis 
and 22 points behind Jackson. 

On the Republican side , the 
Gallup analysts said they detected 
potential trouble for Bush, even 
though he was leading Dole nearly 
2 to I , they nOted the vice president 
held only a 'relatively weak' eighr-
point lead among 'Enterprisers:

The race for the presidency:

constituency. Meanwhile, he was' 
17 points ahead among the GOP's 
other solid bloc, 'Moralisrs: who 
are significantly evangelical and 
strongly conservative on social is-
sues. 

The pollsters artributed the vice 
president's big lead, in part, to his 
high name recognition and 'the 
lack of awareness of other candi-
dares' by Moralists and some GOP-
leaning independents who do not 
keep abreast of public affairs as 
resolutely as Enterprisers. They said 
substantial numbers of these Moral-
ists could begin to tum away from 
Bush as more vote rs focus on the 
preSidential race. 

Among white eva ngelicals speci-
fically, Bush led Dole by 26 points, 
Robertson by 33 points and Kemp 
by 36. 

For Robertson, the survey turnedÂ· 
up a troublesome finding: The pub-
lic, by a 5-3 ratio, believes ir is 'a 
bad thing' for a clergyman to run 

Michael Dukahis 15% 

7% 

for President. The majonry view 
was that 'such a President might 
put the interests of his church 
above the interests of the Amer-
ican people.' (On Tuesday, Roben-
son announced that he is resigning 
as a Southern Baptisr minister and 
cutting ties to his broadcast empire 
as he prepares for the presidential 
race.) 

Even GOP Moralists were nearly 
evenly divided on the question, 
although they did rilt slightly toward 
the belief that it was 'a good thing 
because a President should have 
strong moral and religious convic-
tions.' GOP Enterprisers, however, 
thought it was a 'bad rhing' by a 5-4 
ratio. 

Gallup also found that'two-thirds 
of the most sophisticated and influ-
ential Republicans and Democrats 
hold a favorable view of (Soviet lea-
der) Mikhail Gorbachev.'

4- Monday. Dccober 5. 1987 

Part I 

And then there were six 
By LEESA LIGHT 

I had w think a fe w days ago 
about what year this was. I even 
had 10 check a calendar. I could 
have sworn it was 1988 and the 
presidential elections were next 
month . I was dumbfunded to dis-
cover that it was only 1987 and it 
was really 13 months until election 
day. 

If only life were Simpler. What-
ever happened to the days ofJFK 
when the campaign length was 
only 45 weeks from the first candi-
date's announcement to election 
day. Remember when there were 
only two frontrunners and perhaps 
a few independents tagging along. 
Oh, how I long for the days of 
simplicity, but life as an 'informed 
student' must go on. 

Looking at the way things are 
going on the democratic side of the 
presidential race , it IS a very good 
thmg that it is still 13 months until 
election day. The democrats have 
had a total of nine candidates, but 
not all at the same time. Currently 
there are six democrats seeking the 
party nomination, but the way-
things are progres~ing I doubt that 
they all make it 10 Atlanta for the 
convention. 

Right now things are a little 
shaky among the democrats It all 
began one weekend In May when 

the press linked Gary Han to Donna 
RIce. The question of integrity and 
character was elevated as an im-
portant factor in each and every 
candIdate. The repercussions of 
the Han affair have been felt by 
each one of the democratic candi-
dates 

. As the race runs on , pressure 
Increases with Joe Biden dropping 
out of the race. Biden's unacknow-
ledged use of British Labour Party 
Leader Neil Kinnock's speech, made 
ten days before he withdrew from 
the race was just the beginning of 
hI S character examination. Next it 
was revealed the Biden had com-
mitted plagiarism as a law student. 
And, to top it off. he misrepresented 
hIS academic record to a voter. 
This was the final blow. Biden had 
to withdraw. 

The source of the negative infor-
mation on Biden was John Sasso 
Mickael Dukakis' preSidential cam~ 

p~ign manager. It has been fore-
casted, however, that although 
Dukakis accepted full responsibil-
ity, thi s incident will not adversely 
affecr his campaign for president, 
as did the incidences Involving 
Hart and Biden. 

Fortunately, the third candidate 
who has withdrawn from the race 
has not had to leave under the 
circumstances of the other two. 

Patricia Schroeder chose on her 
own, against the will of her support-
ers and her husband , to withdraw. 
She felt that she had not met her 
goals in fund-raiSing and did not 
want to go into debt. 

Of the current six candidates for 
the democratic nomination, Jesse 
Jackson and Michael Dukakis are 
the frontrunners . 

Jesse Jackson has a great black 
following as well as suppOrt from 
some of the religiOUS leaders. He is 

~ell recogmzed because of previous 
bIds forthe democratic nomination. 

Massachusetts governor Michael 
Dukakis. though he is not as well 
known as Jackson, does have a 
large follOWing. Many believe he is 
the best man for th e job because of 
hIS work in his home Slate of 

Massachu~etts . 
. Paul Simon, a congressman from 

illinois, distinguishes himself from 
the others with his trademark bow 
tie and glasses. Although he is not 
as well-known as Jackson and-
I?ukakis, hIS popularity IS growing. 
SImon appeals to the people as a 
conSIstent, solid candidate. 

Senawr Albert Gore has recently 
gained more support because of 
his outspokenness. He asked last 
Thursday that there be no more 
backbiting among the democratic 
hopefuls . It hurts not only the 

individuals involved , but damages 
the images of the others party 
members as well, Gore said. 

Richard Gephardt and former 
Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt are 
not widely recognized by the 
,~n:eri.can public and their suppOrt 
IS hmlted to a faithful following. 

Hopefully after the first few pri-
manes, one of these democrats will 
stan to win a majority of the v~tes . 
So fat this year the democratic 

hopefuls have not distinguished 
themselves from each other on 
current issues - such as nuclear 
warfare or the budget deficit. Unlike 

~he 1984 presidential campaign, 
Images are not the 'fashion : but 
character and behavior are being 
closely monitored. 
Editor's note: This is part one of a 
two-part series on the presidential 
candidates jor the 1988 elections. 
Part two will appear Thursday.

C.I.A.: the debate continues 
Editor: 

Please continue to print the c.1.A. 
advertisements. I neither condone 
nor reprove the actions of the 
C.I.A., but this should not be the 
issue. I am concerned for the credi-
bility of the Guardian. Discontin-
uing thes~ ads will not seriously 
compromIse the C.I.A.'s ability to 
attract people 10 theirorganization 
but it is likely to damage the reputa~ 
tion of the GuardIan as an ob-
jective, uncensored, non-propagan-
dtsllc newspaper. If you want stu-
dents to continue to trust the Guar-
dian as an objective alternative to 
the politically motivated New In -
dicator and California Review and 
ther~by amplify the Importance of 
the vIews andopinions you express, 
you cannot nsk subjectivity In de-
CIding whIch ads you will print 
and whIch you will censor. The 
readers of a responSible newspaper 
should not have 10 wonder whether 
the news andl or advertisements 
are selected 10 reflect the political 
btases ofthe.edi.lO.rs. Seta policy of 
complete objectivity and stick 10 it. 
Save editorializing for the editorial 
page. It is in the interests of all 
students, both on the left and on 
the right, 10 have a credible forum 
to express their beliefs and ideas. 

Pres~rve the Guardian's objectiVity 
and ItS credibility among the stu-
dents by continuing to print the 
CIA ads. 

Roben Fassett 

Editor: 
Regarding the question of ac-

cepting C.I.A. recruitment adver-
tisements. consider the following 
argumentS: 

Argument I : The Guardian exists 
as a vehicle for presenting editOrial 
matter. EdilOrial matter is the pro-
duct of staff writers , whose re-
portage has traditionally been sub-
ject to strict constitutional pro-
tections. The purpose of such pro-
tections IS 10 ensure that staff 
members may fully control the ex-
pression of ideas in their pub-
\tcatlon. ThIS means that editorial 
staff members can make free choi-
ces about the ideas they wish to 
represent in their newspaper-
and. more importantly, the ideas 
they wish not 10 represent. The 
staff thus constantly limits access 
non-staff members have to the 
forum they control. 

Now, the placement of adver-
tis~ng ~atter sometimes implies an 
edltonal stance. Readers may infer 
that the presence of a particular 

advertisement constitutes an en-
d.orsement (or at least toleration) of 
vIews held by that advertiser. Such 
is the case with the C I.A. recruit-

~ent advertisements rhal ,l l1peared 
In two recent issues 01 the Guardian 
(9/28 and LO/ l). So, when an ad-

v~~isement suggests an ed IlOriai po-
sltlon, the.editorial staff may act to 
control It s presentation . To 
choose not to accept C.IA advertise-
ments is therefore not 10 "ce nsor" 
the agency, but is merely an exercise 
of edltonal authonty no diffe rent 
from that applied daily to choices 
about the presentation of editorial 

ma~ter In the newspaper 
Th?ught of another way, the 

conslltutlOnal protecllons that give 
editorial control to the newspaper's 
staff should not be const rued 10 
guarantee any person or Institution 
access 10 the newspaper's editorial 
or advertiSing space. Consequently 
,~he c.1.~. does not have the righ; 
to publish an advertisement in 

any paper" (Guardian. "Editorial: 
c.I.A. - Yes or No?" lOl l , page 4) .. 
The C.I.A. is not in the business of 
publishing newspapers; in the pre-
sent case , It IS In the business of 
recruiting personnel by advertise-
ment. Given this arrangement the 
Guardian , and not the c.1.A., re~ains 
FlrstAmendment pl0tection offree 
speech. 

Argument 2: the Guardian exists 
as a business. It denves a substantial 
portion of its operating budget 
~rom the sale of advertising space 
In ItS Issues. The value of that 
advertising space is determined by 
the number of people who read the 
?ewspaper (and presumably, see 
liS advertisements). If an advertise-
ment offends readers. causing them 
no longer to read the Guardian, the 
v~lue of advertising space decreases 
with readership, as does income 
from the sale of that spac . With 
diminished income, issues must 
be smaller, and smaller issues allow 
less space for the presentation of 
editorial matter. Thus, it would be 
only prudent for the Guardian staff 
to reject advertisements that would 
by their placement, decrease rea~ 
dership, reduce income, and limit 
the scope of editorial voice. 

Both arguments, I think, suggest 
that II would be sensible and appro-
pnate to decline the C.I.A's future 
requests 10 purchase advertising 
space. 

Peter Mortensen 
Editor in Chief 

UCSD Guard",n. 1981-82 

Editor. 
There are many ways to ".ct on 

an issue about which you feel 
strongly. One way is to suppress the 
vl.ews of people with whom you 
dIsagree. This method was em-
ployed earlier this week right here 
at UCSD by two gentlemen who 
allegedly slOle bundles of Monday's 
Guardian and attempted to hide 
them becau5e they felt that the 
newspaper should not have pnnted 
an advertIsement from the Central 
Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.). In my 
mind, these actions merely make 
the "aCllvlsts" and their cause look 
bad 

There is what I feel to be a far 
better way o f acting on your be-
liefs-let OppOSIng behefs be heard 
and then refute them. One method 
of doing this IS exactly what I am 
doing now- writing a "Letter 10 
the Editor." Had Mr. Howard and 
Mr. Schoenberg chosen this me-
thod , I personally would respect 
them a great deal more. 

On the issue raised by Guardian 
editor, Niki Newlands. in her edi -

. torial, "C.I.A.-Yes or No?" (OCt I. 
1987; page 4), whether or not the 
Guardian should accept advertising 
from the C.I.A., I have to say yes. 
Not that I agree with the C. I A's 
actions, because I do not. However 
not 10 let the C.I.A. have its say' 
would be effectively doing the same 
thing as hiding bundles of the 
Guardian behind a dumpster. It all 
adds up to censorship. 

Correction 
In last Thursday'S issue of the Gua(d,an 
(f~~ l ."Campus aClivisl arresled for trespass-
rng J. It was mcorrecliy stated that Andy 
Howard and Arnie Schoenberg were not 
students. The Guard",n regrets this error

UCSD disabled find campus challenging 
By LINDA). GUVE 
StalJ Wrikr 

Walkmgfrom one end of campus 
to another is enough to make a 
person feel like a salmon SWimming 
upstream. Add [0 this a physical 
disability and rampant campus 
construc tion and what you get is a 
preuy per uasive argument for 
staymg at home. Temporarily and 
permanemly disabled students at 
UCSD often find themselves takmg 
a class they didn 't enroll in -
Obstacle Course 10 l.J USI what IS It 
lIke to be disabled at UCSD? 

"It's dangerous for me to walk 
toO fast ," Vera Salibar laughed 

Sahbar, the only srudem at UCSD 
who is blind, IS a Junior computer 
s len e major at Muir. "Bikes and 
skateboards give me trouble .. and 
people sometimes don't move OUt 

lof the way," she said. 

promised to look into the matter, 
but says that the best his office 
could do is put down plywood o r 
cardboard in the worst spots. 

One item that Wilbur-Burton 
hopes will make the campus more 
convenient despite the con stant 
construction is the new Campus 
Accessibility Map. It includes spe-
cific access information for more 
than 100 campus buldings, includ-
ing Scripps, plus a fold-out access 
route guide , and information on 
emergency phones, personal safety , 

. fire safety , and emergency infor-
mation. This publication is due out 
in the middle of fall quarter. 

Aside from the roundabout routes 
made necessary by steep hills and 
construction sites, the complaints 
of the disabled students are familiar 
to us all-dogs, bicycles and skate-
boards, and the lack of time be-
tween classes, particularly if they 
are going from one end of campus 
to the next. 

"It's hard for permanently dis-
abled students 10 reach this high 
level of education ," Connie Wilbur-
Bunon said. "Once they get here, 

Sahbar did not stan usmg the 
customa ry white cane until she 
came to UCSD At that time a 
Mobility Orientation Trainer from 
the an Diego Center for the Blmd 
came ou t to campus fo "show" her 
around. and mstruct her on where 
her classes were and how 10 get to 
them 

"This is done for all visually 
impaired students," ConOie WIlÂ· 
bur-Burton, director of Disabled 
Student Services ( DSS) said. "A 
tramer comes out and usually 
spends around 1010 12 hours with 
a student , showing them around 
campus and their classrooms, then 
tests them on the route." 

Vera Salibar, a blind student at UCSD, is caught between two of the many obstacles at UCSD 
construction sites and bicycles. ' 

. we (DSS) try to help them as much 
as we can ." 

DSS provides many services in-
cluding academic support person-
nel, comprised mainly of students. 
These include interpreters, readers, 
notetakes , laboratory and library 
assistants , typists , and OIher assistÂ· 
ants . The services of these people 
are available to both learning and 
functiona lly (temporarily and per-
manently) disabled students. After locating her class, however, 

Vera must face another problem-
choosing the easiest way to get 
there. 

At UCSD there are about as 
many ways to get from one spot to 
another as there are eucalyptus 
trees. Fortunately, most of them 
happen to be in "straight lines." 
These straight lines go through 
groves of trees, along dirt paths, 
and up and down hills, some of 
which are rather steep. Despite 
this, it is still not very difficult 
to get around. But the recent explo-
sion of construction has changed 
all that. 

To no one has it posed more 
difficulty than [0 the disabled 
students These following areas are 
especially problematic. 

â¢ The route from the hOUSing 
office, which goes across Hutchinson 
Way and past the International 
Center, to Stude nt Center Building 
B. 

â¢ Old Miramar Road from the 
police station to the curve by the 
newly built Ce nter for MagnetiC 
Recording Research and the Char-
les Lee Powell Structures Laboratory. 
For over a year now this stretch of 
road has been torn up and blocked 
o ff from all but pedestrian traffic . It 
is a Jumble of concrete and dirt; 
turning to mud in the ram .

DireclOr of Construction remarked 
there is nO! much that can be done 
about the construction areas that 
pose problems of transportation 
and access for disabled students. 
"We try 10 make alternate routes 
when one is torn up," he said, "but 
we can't guarantee to keep a route 
open," such as the one blocked 
through the Central Library parking 
lot. 

Regarding the route down Old 
Miramar Road, Brown sa id that the 
only thing that is halting road 
repair is the installment of a gas 
line. This could , however, take 
weeks, or even months, and until 
such time this route must remain 
impaired . 

The excessive amount of mud is 
another problem. Rainfall makes 
mobility difficult and treacherous. 
Brouwn, who says he was "una-
ware" of chronic problem areas , 

For the functionally disabled-
there are three blue, battery-power-
ed vehicles-one of which has a 
wheelchair lift that travel to more 
than 30 locations on campus. In 
comparison, San Diego State, which 
has 400-500 permanently disabled 
students- approx imately three 
times the number here at UCSD 
-has only one such vehicle.) Rides 
are scheduled a minimum of 24 
hours in advance, between the 
hours of 8:45 am and 4:00 pm 
Monday through Friday.

during the ski season , January 
through March; a time when many 
students find themselves tempo-

86 year, the carts were in operatiorr 
an hour earlier in the morning. 

The reduction in hours and rides 
is due to a $22,861 decrease in the 
university-wide method of alloca-
tion of state funds to disabled 
studem programs. However, direct-
or Wilbur-Burton predicts that the

In addition, a project proposal 

entitled Handicapped Access Im-
provement, Step II worth approxi -
mately $1,168.00, was submitted to 
office of the preSi dent of the Uni-
versity of California in August of 
1986. Step I, submitted In 1981 ,

FEATURES 

The handicapped access improvement includes the 
addition of elevators to buildings on campus two or 
more stories high as well as the construction of ramps in 
the I nternational Center, 

rarily disabled by a broken limb or 
two. During the last school year, 
there was an average of 115 sched-
uled rides per week. The total 
numbt:r of rides for the year was 
4,730, a decrease from the 85-86 
tOlal of 7,756. Also during the 85-

number o f rides will be back up to 
where it was over the 1985-86 year 
due to a general increase in the 
state funds allocation for the 1987-
88 academic year. Already DSS is 
acquiri ng another ve hicle, and three 
new drivers to increase their ride 

It could be weeks or even months until th is construction site by the 
police station will be accessible to disabled students.

campus. Improvements covered by 
Step II include the addition of 
elevators to buildings on campus 
twO or more stories high; such as 
the Main Gym, a nd tWO of the 
buildings at Scripps. There are also 
plans for the construction of ramps 
in places such as the Internation al 
Center, and more cu rb-cuts to allow 
students access 10 shoner routes. 

Right now, these plans are in the 
planning stage. After this, they 
must be approved by the State and 
Agency Review board , then be avail-
able for the bidding of contractors 
Each step will take approXimately 
two months or longer. 

Robert Thorburn, an architect In 
the Design and Construction Office 
on campus, estimates that con-
struction should be fi n ished in 
about one and a half to two years if 
the prOject stays on schedule. In

continue to present obstacles for 
disabled students .

X-country 
runs over 
ChaplIlan 
By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
sports Editor 

On Friday, October 2, the UCSD 
cross country team hosted Its first 
dual meet against Chapman Col-
lege. 

However, It was as though 
Chapman never existed as the 
men's te.lm rook the first 15 SpotS 
for a 15 'i0 VictOry (cro~s COUntry's 
equlval nt to a shutout) and thc 
women. led by DentsI' McFayden, 
beat bot h Chapman (80) and 
speCial gucst CSU an Bernardino 
(37) with 20 pOints. 

ForthI' men, Tim Vallez fim~hed 
fIrSt with a time of28:26.00verthe 
five-mile course that runs through 
UCSD's par course near the Super-
computer. Mike Angiolelll finishetl 
second at 28:31.2. The meet also 
marked the return of last year's 
MVP, Merrel Hora 

Hora had been leading the men's 
pack before making a wrong turn 
close to the end of the race . 
"Apparently there was a spectator 
in his path who caused Merrel to 
think he had ro make a left instead 
of a right. However, the spectaror 
was only trying to cheer him on," 

,.. .-, "" . 

Mike Angioletti is all smiles as he fin ishes second Friday against 
Chapman. Close behind is Merrel Hora. 

I' plained cross COUntry Coach 
Mark Stanforth . Although he was 
able ro regain the lead for a while , 
the extra distance was too much 

for Hora. who eventually finished 
third in 28:32.8.

Good teams can make their op-
position look bad. When you're the 
best Division III volleyball team in 
the nation , you can make your 
opponents look very, very bad. 
That's exactly what the Triron 
women did to Chapman College 
- a respectable Division II squad. 

rhe 109 fans in attendance at 
the UCSD gym were expecting to 
see a close match between two 
teams of relallvely equal strength 
What they saw, instead . was a 
Tnton dismanthng of the Chapman 
Panthers (3-7) as the UCSD women 
took an easy 3-0 vic tory. 

Lon Lunhow ope ned the match 
by serving the Tritons to a 6-0 lead 
and the team never looked back as 
they rolled ro a 15-3 victory in the 
match's first game. In game two, 
they took an early 8-0 lead en route 
to a 15-2 win. 

Only in the third game did fans 
see an inkling of the Chapman 
team they expected. Once again, 
the Trirons played their way to an 
early lead at 4-0. However, a slight 
breakdown in the Triton passing 
attack and overall improvement in 
the play of the Panthers allowed 
the visirors ro slowly fight their way 
back, takinga 9-8lead - their first 
of the match. From there, the rwo 
teams exchanged leads severa l 

times before the Tritons were able 
ro tally the final three points and 
take the last game of the match 
15-11. 

UCSD was led by Janet Hughes 
and Carol Lipson. Hughes im-
pressed Coach Doug Dannev ik 
with he r defense - s he was 
involved in seven ofUCSD's twelve 
defensive blocks. In add ition , she 
converted twelve of her 15 kill 
attempts for an amazing .733 
average The person primarily 
responsible for Hughes' success 
was Carol Lipson , who assi~ted on 
27 of the Tritons' 31 kills. She also 
dug II Chapman attempts. 

After the game, Chapman Coach 
Tom Read did not hesitate ro praise 
the Trirons , However, he was 
downcast about his team's per-
fo rmance, "UCSD's got a nice 
team ... These two tcams are pretty 
even but for some reason we de-
cided not to play in the first two 
games. We didn't play like the 
team we're capable of being. We 
played like an expletive delete ... 
like dog ----." 

Dannevik agreed with the 
Chapman coach, "We were ex-
pecting a tougher match from 
Chapman. We served, passed and 
blocked well tonight, our defense 
was real good and I think we put a 
lot of pressure on them because 
they didn 't do a very good job

McFayden and SabrinaJensen, who 
finished secon d wi th a time of

runner for the women's tea m all 
season. Stanforth is expecting 
continued success from them in 
the future . 

"[ think we have a good team," 
remarked Stanforth. "The women, 
in particular, can develop into a 
powerful team. The men run pretry 
close together. They began this 
race running as a pack and only 
opened up towards the end, still 
finished with the lOp 15 spots."

The coac h was also very happy 
with the way his team has come 
togcther. The team is playing at a 
very high level and their offense is 
starting to click. "This wa~ a real 
solid win ," he said, "We're a real 
solid team." 

The nation's top-ranked Division 
l\l women's volleyball team is now 
13-2. The team is coming off one of 
its most convincing vinories and 
now faces only a handful of tough 
matches in the comi'lg weeks, and 
so. should hold ontO its ranking. 

Chapman College may not have 
played its best game at the UCSD 
gym Saturday night, but the Tritons 
still looked very, very good. And 
very, very good teams often can 
make you look very, very bad.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO THURSDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1987 

Students and administrators 
debate problems, role ofTAs 
By ISABELLE TIHANYI 
Staff WritCT 

It was annou nced Monday, dur-
ing the orientation meeting and 
panel discussion at the Interna-
1I0nai Center, that stronger re-
quirements will be Implemented 
next year regarding the screening 
of foreign teaching assistants. 

John Andrews, director of TA 
Development, began the discussion 
by welcoming the new foreign TA's. 
"The leacher's assistant role ," 
Andrews stressed, "is very impor-
tant to us on campus. There are 
several ways that this campus 
stands behind its teaching ... [Pri-
marilYI. that all TAs are required to 
go through training. 

Following the welcome, Manna 
Stacklin , instructor for the Foreign 
TA Language Program, mediated 
the panel dis ussion (among nve 
students) regarding communica-
tions problems, grade sy terns, time 
management, and the role and 
importance of the TA. Panel mem-
bers included three foreign gradu-
ate T As and two American under-
graduate students. This helped the 
incoming TAs to understand some 
of [he cultural differences to which 
they would soon be exposed. 

The graduate students were: 
Langfang Woo, a first -year math 
TA from Taiwan; Jou Lin , a nfth-
year economics TA from Taiwan; 
and Michael Lofthagen. a fir t-year 
chemistry TA from Sweden, The 
undergraduates were Todd tewart, 
EECS, and A. . president Dave 
Marchick, history. 

The informal discussion began 
with Stewart and March ick com-
menting on their expectations of 
T As. The TAs then responded wilh 
their views about the position as 
well as the students' role. 

Stewart commented that TAs 
communicate differently than the 
professors. "'t's easier to ask a TA 
specinc questions. The TA offers 
something more familiar to the 
studffit. 'f the T A i weUÂ· prepared, 
it is very helpful to hear an exten-
sion of what the professor said." 

Marchick agreed and commen-
ted on the student-teacher ratio, 
which makes the TA invaluable for 
personalized aid . "The role of the 
TA is just as important. .. I as the 
professor'sl . Students coming in 
find 300-400 [studentsl for one 
professor. There is also Ihe prob-
lem of intimidation ... and a need 
for a one-to-one basis. The burden 
of a lot of instruction comes down 

on the T A. The Situation is I hat an 
undergraduate Iwith ,\ problem l IS 
more hkcly to go to the TA." 

Woo defined the TA's job as try-
ing "to solve problems for students 
But also to communicate with the 
professor what problems students 
might be having." 

Lin stressed the importance of 
his work by stating that the POSI -
tion was not one to be taken lightly. 
"'t's a responsibility. You are werk-
ing together as a team to be organ-
ized with the schedule and rosters 
and constantly keeping contact 
with the professor. You have 10 
care if the students are progress-
ing It' s not just xeroxing the 
answers and handing them out It's 
gUiding the progress ... You're not 
JUst ge.nt~ t~money; you'~ gfIt 
ting the job [done I." 

Loflhagen then pointed out that 
TAs have recently learned the sub-
ject themselves and can easily relate 
to the difficulties encountered by 
the students. "You can tell the pro-
fessor what was too hard for the 
students because you had similar 
problems." 

Srackli n t hen asked what stu-
dents expect from their TAs. Mar-
chick stated four mai n pOints.

U.S. attorney's office reopens Crabtree case 
F. B.l. uses student intern to gather info 

By LETICIA VILLARREAL 
St4Jf Writer 

The United State's attorney's of-
fice has reopened a case that 
seemed over and done with when 
Chief U.S. Dislrict Gordon Thomp-
son. Jr., at a prelrial heari ng on 
August) , dismissed a felony assault 
Kristen Crabtree, a Third College 
honors student, The charge arose 
from a May 14 indden ,1 during a 
Career Fair at I he Career Center. 

Crabtrer was among the approx-
imately 20 individuals present that 
day to protest the partici pation of 
F.B.I., c.1.A. , and armed forces in 
that event. 

The protestors took over some 
tables reserved for the F.B.1. and 
the c.1.A. before the arrival of the 
representativesthese two agenCies. 
On these tables they displayed 
photographs of brutalities that they 
held these United States agenCies 
responsible for. The caption under 

O.wn Mamikunlan '(.IWI,Ir, II' 
Vice-Chancellor Joseph Watson is disturbed about how the FBI is 
conducting its investigation of UCSD student Kristen Crabtree. 

one phmograph of carnage in Cen-
tral America suggested joining the 
el.A. and "helping with the compa-
ny barbecue". 

The presence of the protestors at 
the F.B.I. table created a volatile 
situation when F.B.I. Special Agent 
Marene All ison arrived at the scene. 
Soon after a scumI' broke out be-
[ween Allison and Crabtree when 
Crabtree tried to take a photograph 
of Allison. In attempting to prevent 
being ph otographed . Allison 
grabbed at Crabtree's camera strap 
(which was around her neck). and 
yanked Crabtree toward her. The 
scume ended when Crabtree ap-
parently bit the agent's finger . 

Several hours later, Crabtree w as 
arrested and spent a short time in 
jail charged with ass.lUhing a fed-
eral officer. 

At a pretrial heartng on Aug. 3, 
Allison stated that she attempted to 
SlOp Crabtree from taking her PiC-
ture becausc rabtrce and her fel-
low prote ters were wean ng c hec k-
ered scarves that AlIislln aSSOCiated 
with the P,llestlne Llberallon Org-
,mizatlon (PLO). Alii on also stated 
that "Sometimes. the best defense 
IS a good otfense." 

Judge Thompson saw the 1,1I[er 
tatement as ,m Ind,CatiOn that

Crabtree for biting Allison 's finger. 
Thompson was much more critical

on the grounds that the federal

New law adjusts financial 
aid regulations 

The Higher Education Technical 
Amendments of 1987, Signed by Presi-
dent Reagan June 3, made 42 changes m 
student aid programs. The three most 
significant changes include a clarifica-
tion of student income definitions, a 
revision of the definition is of independ-
ent student status ana the addition of 
achievements standards for students 
admitted under the "abiliry to benefit" 
provision. 

Last month, these changes were 
incorporated imo program regulations by 
the Department of Education First, the 
portion of Tide IV assistance, including 
Pell Grams, used to pay for tuition and 
fees for a course of study, as well as 
books, supplies, transportation, and mis-
cellaneous personal expenses, may not 
be conSidered as mcome or resource in 
determinmg a student'!> eltgiblhty for any 
other program funded m whole or 111 
part with Federal funds . The Intent of 
Congress was to insure that student aid 
would not disqualify a person from food 
stamps who would otherwise be eligible. 
PreVIOusly, no portion of Tn Ie IV ass l t-
ance, except for Pell Grants, could be 
used as income or resource in determln-
II1g total mcome. 

Second, the dcfil1ltion of Independent 
students has been c1ari fied A si ngle per-
son with no dependents, who was not 
claimed as a dependent by hiS or her 
parents for the twO calendar years 
precedmg the award year and demon-
strates self-suffICiently for each year of 
the two years preceding the award year, 
would qualify as independent by demon-
strating an nual total resources of ~4000 
m each of those years. Annual total 
resources now may include all students 
finanCial assistance, as well as other 
resources normally counted as income In 
meeting the requirement of this defil1l-
tion . 

The third change reflects Congres-
sional concern with higher educational 
standards. A low-income student who is 
admitted on the baSIS of "the abihty to 
benefit," must now meet one of the fol-

BLOOM COUNTY 

lowing onditions: (I )the student must 
receive Ihe GED pnor to graduation or 
by the end of the first year of study, whi -
chever IS earl ier; (2) the student must be 
counseled before admission and must be 
enrolled In and successfully complete an 
institutionally prescribed remedial pro-
gram not to exceed one academic year or 
its eqUIvalent; or (3) the student must 
a standardized aptitude test . and if 
failed, the student must successfully 
co mplete an institutionally prescribed 
remedial program not to exceed one 
acade mic year. 

New birth control methods 
available soon 

A witle of variet), of safer and more effec-
tive birth contH'1 methods will soon be 
available which Will widen the range of 
cholCc for consumers. The advent of new 
methods Will almost certaml}' comphcate 
the current controversy regarding abor-
lion and birth control. The use of new 
approaches includes long range of con-
traceptives, "conrragestives" taken after 
conception and abomficants. 

everallongterm contraceptlves are 
bemg tested or used. One device is a 
simple implant placed beneath the skin 
of a woman's upper arm It is conSidered 
to be JUSt as effective as sterhzation, and 
can be removed at any time. 

Another approach kills sperm with low 
level electncity. A tin)' battery, which is 
placed In the cervix, produces enough 
electriCity to kill sperm amd can be left 
In for up to a year His inventor says it 
has proved 100 percent effective m 
animals but has yel to be approved for 
human use. 

ew contragcstives are also being 
developed . RU486 is a new birth control 
pill created in France. II does not prevent 
conception but prevents the fertilized 
egg from implanting m the uterus. Test 
have found it to be 70 to 85 percent 
effective , and it doesn't cause the vomit-
ing or abdominal pain sometimes 
brought on by estrogen-based pills. 

ew abortifacients include suppositO-
ries contaming the drug prostaglandin 
which mduces premature labor and 

causes the fetus to abort . In thl' Uniteu 
tates, they are only sold in hnspi l,tI~ . but 

they could easily find their W,I)' Into the 
public's hands. This new generatloll of 
birth control technology threatens Il) 
cloud the abortion controversy as well as 
the question of when human life begins. 

Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulien, developer of 
RU486, does nor consider it an abortifi-
cant since the drug expells the embryo 
before it becomes a fetus. But a conserva-
tive congressman called RU486 a "death 
pill" and conservative pressure on Con-
gress has prevented it from being tested 
here. 

Although the list of new breakthroughs 
is long and impressive, population con-
trol activists think progress is being 
impeded. Were it not for political oppo-
sition and low funding by the federal 
government, development of even bener 
bmh control methods would be much 
farther advanced that it is. 

New fellowship program to 
aid females and minorites 

A University of Cal.ifornia program 
designed to boost the number of minor-
ity and woman faculty members by pro-
viding postdoctoral research fellowship 
IS now acceptmg applications for the 
1988-89 academic year. Program Coor-
dinator Doris Fine said the President's 
Fellowship Program will select approxi-
mately 20 new fellows, and renew fellow-
ships for approxi mately 22 others. 

The program is now beginning its 
fourth year of offering postdoctoral 
research grants to woman and minorities 
in fields in which they are underrepres-
ented. Preference is given to woman and 
minorities in mathematiCS, science and 
engineering. Minorities from other disci-
plines also re-encouraged to apply, Fine 
said. 

Although their numbers are mcreasi ng, 
Fme said woman currently comprise just 
13.8 percent of the tenure track faculty at 
UC, while Blacks comprise 1.8 percent 
and Chicanos 1.5 percent. 

"Through this program, we hope to 
enhance the competitiveness of out-
standing minority and woman scholars 
for academic appointments at major 
research universities by proViding them 
with research assistance and guidance 
toward of their academic careers." Fine 
said. 

Each fellow will receive a stipend rang-
ing from$22,OOO to $28,000 depending 
on the research experience.The program

TA training_ 
Language issue, others, dealt with in various ways 
By JAMES PINPIN 
StaJ!Writu 

Problems conce rning compefency of 
teachi ng assistants (TAs), with emphasis on 
foreign TAs, and measures that might solve 
these problems were discussed in a meeting 
Sept. 17. 

This meeting was comprised of members 
of the faculty and administrative offices of 
the Graduate and the Undergraduate Stu-
dies (chemistry, CSE, economics, ECE, math-
ematics and physics), members of the Asso-
ciated Students, and members of the Center 
for Teaching Development, which special-
izes in TA training and development. 

Organized by Dr. Richard Attiyeh, dean of 
Graduate Studies, upon the request of A.S. 
president Dave Marchick, this meeting fo-
cused on the importance of TAs in the 
UCSD academic system, the incapability of 
some TAs to teach their students, the prob-
lems of training TAs, the language barrier 
between some foreign TAs and their stu-
dents, and the implementation of a possible 
solution to this barrier. 
Imponance and Incompetence 

"The emphasis on UCSD, where the one-
to-one contact between the student and the 
instructor comes in , is not usually in a large 
classroom situation with the teacher. It is 
with a TA. That makes the TA's job so much 
more important ," Marchick said. 

Marchick emphasized that the TA prob-
lems do not exist only at UCSD, but are 
found nationwide, as shown by find ings of 
the Carnegie Foundation on Higher Educa-
tion and the Smelser Report. He also said he 
is glad the administration has been very 
responsive in trying to solve these problems. 
The meeting, Marchick said, is a testimony 
to both these statements. 

Ellen Smith, a 6th-year math major who 
has taken numerous classes from chemistry 
to physics to philosophy and economics, 
spoke about instances where good TAs 
made significant and positive differences to

her academic life. She talked also about her 
experiences with incompetent TAs who 
couldn't understand her questions, TAs who 
could understand, but who couldn't com-
municate back, and who didn't care at all. 

In defense of foreign TAs, Smith emphas-
ized that the language barrier is not the main 
problem. "['ve had foreign TAs who couldn't 
speak good English, but were trying so hard 
and were meaning so well that they ended 
doing well anyway, simply because they 
were really interested in doing well. There 
are lalso incompetentl TAs who could speak 
perfectly good English," she said. (See related 
foreign TA orientation article in this issue.) 

Problems of Training 
Though some departments have suffi -

cient TA training programs, others do not. 
The inconsistency of a TA training policy 
among departments is a major problem in 
trying to train TAs. According to Marchick, 
there is no campus-wide, TA training policy. 
He views this to be a result of the diversity of 
TA training guidelines, and a lack of clarity 
of where responsibility rests forTA training, 
between the different departments and the 
Center for Teaching Development. And , 
though the center has a number of different 
programs that can develop and enhance the 
teaching capabilities of TAs, not all of the 
departments are taking advantage of the 
options available. 

"Each department is given autonomy ... 
because they know the kind of student they 
have and the kind of teaching and informa-
tion that the student needs to get from the 
TA," Martha Stacklin, language consultant 
for the center, explained . "Each depart -
ment decides on whether they would like to 
use TA development as part of the student's 
TA training, of whether they would like to 
conduct their own T A training," she added. 

Another reason why all of the depart-
ments are not using the center's training 
programs and other available resources is 
the lack of communi cation between de-

partments and the ce nter. It was discovered 
in the meeting that some of the department 
chairs were not even aware of the center's 
programs. 
The Language Barrier 

Another issue discussed at the meeting is 
the level of proficiency (or lack of) in the 
English language of foreign graduate stu-
dents who become TAs at the univerSity. 

A campus-wide solution to this problem 
is already being implemented by the Center 
for Teaching Develo pment under the gui-
dance of Ms. Stacklin andJohn Andrews, the 
center's director. The new policy, planned 
and recommended last year by a TA devel-
opme nt advisory committee, requires screen-
ing and if necessary, subsequent communi-
cation skills training of all new foreign TAs. 

According to Dean Attiyeh , those who 
successfully pass the screening are not 
required to undergo the Foreign Teaching 
Assistant Language Program, while those 
who demonstrate need for communication 
skills training will have to succeed in the 
program before they arc allowed to become 
TAs. He added that foreign students who 
test somewhere in the "" middle" will concur-
rently be both a TA and a participant in the 
program. 

Ms. Stacklin explained that since this 
program is in its pilot year (this is the first 
year that the center ha received enough 
funding to make the service campus-wide), 
most of the improvements will be organiza-
tional and ad ministrative. However, changes 
in her program will be made by using the 
feedback she gets from the traming courses 
she teaches and from [he research she has 
done. She also encourages undergraduates 
to continue to let the admmistration. and 
her, specifically, know how they feel about 
TAs and about her foreign TA trai ning 
program. 

Marchick feels wary about the program. 
however. He explained that the university 
actually made agreements with these foreign 
graduate students - it will support them, 

while they study and do their research at 
UCSD, since they are not capable of singu-
larly supporting themselves. Usually , sup-
POrt would come in the form of TA posi-
tions. Marchick questioned when a foreign 
student continually fails the screening pro-
cess whether the ul1lversiry will give him the 
position anyway, ask the student to leave or 
find or create alternative means to support 
himself. . 

"It's vital that the students, the staff, the 
faculty and the administration work on this 
problem together. The administration has to 
make it a priority in terms of funding and 
staff emphasis. The faculty must give the 
graduate students significant supervision 
and evaluation before and during the TA's 
instruction 1 of students] . Graduate students 
must take an ac tive role in trying to improve 
their Iteaching] skills. Undergraduate stu-
dents should take an active interest [by 
informing the faculty member if the T A is 
not acceptable ]. 1 Finally I. I hope that the 
university's policy Iconcerning the foreign 
TAs] is stri ct and consistent," Marchick 
concluded. ~

Though Watson believes "both the StU-

that student (the intern) would be limited in 
the campus dialogue," and that students 
investigating othe r students "has a chilling 
effect on the university, he emphaSized that

When asked to comment on her situa-

Part II 

GOP o.k. for now 
By LEESA LIGHT 

Having a GOP president in om e 
could be either a blessing or a curse 
for the RepublIcans The re ogni-
tion factor has certainly helped. 
but the Iran arms scandal has tar-
nIshed the Republicans image. 

The Republl ans running are 
mu h beller known than the Demo-
cratic candIdates maInI), because 
of theIr current poll[i al posHlons 
Although Vice PreSIdent George 
Bush has nO! }'Ct offiCIally declared 
that he IS running. he IS on a cam-
paIgn lOur Currently. Bush IS the 
most well known and the most 
popular candIdate In the past few 
da>'s however. Bush has had 10 
apologIze for hIS 100 e tongue 
Bush has nor spoken OUt on many 
Issues In the past, but he has begun 
10 vOIce hIS oplntons on a few 
Issues In the last month . Bush IS 
also a foreign policy man as can be 
een by hIS travels through many 

cou ntries In the last few months 
and hIS work on Internallonal rela-
tions Bush IS making a greal effort 
to come OUt of hIS shell. although 
he has always been known as a 
middle ground man 

enate Mlnoruy Leader Bob Dole 
IS also a well known candidate He 
IS currentl>' runn Ing a close thIrd In 
the polls Bush I~ kadlng by J large 
percent . Jes e Jack on IS second 
Jnd Dole 15 l<lIl1ng Jackson by 
approxImately fIve percentage 
POintS. 

Dole has tJken some drastic 
measures to Improve hiS stand-
Ings. He met wl[h NIcaraguan Pres-
Ident Dantel Ortega last month to 
dISCUSS the current sl[uatlon In 
NIcaragua and has been voting 
against Reagan's stand In recent 
senatc conflIcts. Dole IS also famil 
lar to many because hIS wife Eliza-
beth was a secretary of Transporta-
tlon before she reSigned to support 
her husband's campaIgn. 

Former Secretary of State Alex-
ander M. Halg. Jr. IS next In the 
polls. He stands on hiS fo reIgn pol-
ICY experience and though mark-
edly conservative. he is making 

Reagan's international mistakes a 
major Issue In his campaign . 

The Rev. Manon Gordo n '''Pal'' 
Robe rtson is well known as the tel-
eVision evangellsl who hosts the 
"700 lub." Robertson Will have to 
project the Idea that he will not 
force hi religious opinions on 
Americans nor will he determine 
public policy by them. 

Representallve Jack Kemp and 
PIerre '''Pete'' du POnt I , former 
Governor of Delaware. are also 
running for the Republican noml-
natwn Borh men are recognIzed 10 
J degree. but nationally they need 
more exposure 

Harold tassen . the 80-year-old 
former Minnesota governor. an-
nounced last week that he will 
enter the racc for the Republican 
nomInallon once again. ThiS will 
be the eighth lime that he has run . 

Wh ile Vice President Bush has 
had the experience that a presi-
dent needs (especiall y after [he 
assaslnation attempt on Reagan ) 
he seldom has an option of hIS 
own. People in positions of author-
II)' need to seek counsel In theIr 
actIOns. but the), should hase theIr 
deCIsions on what adVIce Ihey 
recel\'e. and not JUSt take thlllgs as 
they're gIven to them All tOO often 
Bush lets olhers InOuener hiS VI(\\'5 
Howc\'er, Jt the Republican con-
venuon Bush will mo,t likel>' be 
bIlled as presldem with Dolc as 
vIce pre Idem. 

Dukakls IS a good omender for 
the Democratic nom illatiOn for pres-
Ident. With Paul SImon or Al Gore 
III the vice pres Idem slots things 
could pick up quickly. 

Others {hat have been cont inu-
ally urged 10 run for presidem are 
Senator Edward Kennedy D-Mass .. 
Governer Mano Cuomo D- ew 
York. SenalOr Sam Nun n D-Ga .. 
and former Chief of Staff, Howard 
Baker-R If any of these men entered 
the race II would make a big differ-
ence espeCially for the Demo rats. 
Unfortunately all of these men have 
firmly dented the rumors that they 
will emer the race.

Not just a matter of 
free speech 

Editor: 
It seems to me that the people 

arguing against restricting the 
C.I.A.'s advertisement in the 
Guardian are missing the point on 
why they should be restriCted. Of 
course "discontinuing these ads 
will not seriously compromIse the 
C.I.A.'s ability to attract people 10 
their organization" (Lellers, 1015). 
That is not the main purpose. Also, 
the restrict ion is nor meant to 
"suppress the views of people with 
whom you disagree" (Letters , 1015). 
although that could possibly be a 
by-product. 

The main purpose of restriCting 
c.1.A. advertisements is to de-
monstrate the newspaper's dis-
agreement with the practices of the 
C.I.A. If the views of the C.I.A. were 
all that was at stake. this issue 
would be a different marter. Sadly, 
though. the c.1.A. does not only 
express views. but is capable of 
powerful action . This does not 
mean that the Guardian should 
closely scrutinize every advertiser's 
political practices and not print 
the ad if the editors disagree with 
the politiCS in any way. lit the case 
of the C.I.A. . however, the practices 
are suffiCiently illegal and immoral 
to warrant such an action. For 
example. I don't think that the 
Guardian would allow the Klu-
Klux-Klan or some terrorist group 
to advertise for membership re-
cruitment. I do not intend to equate 
the C:: .I.A. with such organizations, 
but I would say that their activities 
come sufficiently close. In the past, 
the c.1.A. has been proven to be 

It's the 

part of assassination attempts. 
mining of international harbors. 
and the overthrow of legitimately-
elected governments. Currently. it 
continues 10 be accused of such 
acts (see new book, Bob Wood-
ward's "Secret Veil"). Should an 
organization that engages in ter-
rorist activity and acts (that run) 
coumer to the prinCIples this coun-
try supposedly stands for . really be 
allowed to recruit members with 
the help of our own newspapers? If 
we let them do this. don't we 
become a parry to their atroci ties'

Hypocrisy at its very best 
Editor: 

I was both annoyed and hu-
mored when I read the article 
about members of the new indicator 
staff trying to steal and hide issues 
of the Guardian. Annoyed because 
any person in our country. especial-
ly someone that works for a news-
paper. should respect freedom of 
the press as the foundation for pro-
tecting individual liberties in our 
SOciety. Humored because it was 
members of the new indicator staff. 
the very same people that always 
seem to clamor loudest for freedom 
of the press. that were responsible. 

Although not directly stated, I 
assume that Andy Howard and co. 
were redirecting Guardian newspa-
pers as a protest against lelling the 
C.I.A. advertise in the paper. They 
may have achieved their purpose 
(now. anybody who didn't know 
the new indicator was against the 
C.I.A. does) , but at the price of try-
ing to violate basic freedoms guar-
anteed in the Constitution.

Many newspapers have "bad" 
advertisements. Who is not angered 
when they read of a famous person-
aillY dying of lung cancer and see a 
Camel's ad on the next page? I 
remember one time reading about 
the physical and psychological dam-
age that can happen to people who 
lose weight very quickly by fasting 
or severely reducing their food 
intake. Two pages later was a var-
iety of ads for diet pills. outrageous 
diet plans. even liposuction surgery. 
What is going on here? Isn 't the 
newspaper standing up for some-
thing. and its very advertisements 
making a mockery of all it is trying 
to do? Again, like with most diffi-
cult questions, the answer is not a 
clear yes or no. but somewhere in-
between. 

If newspapers refuse to run ads 
because they don't approve of it's 
contents (with exception 10 adver-
tisements that are against local. 
state . or federal laws and regula-
tions) they are denying their read-
ers one of their most important

should not be undertaking but 
rather offering employment In an 
agency that does some good and 
some bad like most things In life. 
Our goal should be to exercise our 
influence through positive chan-
nels to effect change. 

The debate about the activities 
of the C.I.A. IS quite healthy and 
one hopes that it will encourage a 
change In the Agency's activities. 
Prohibiting the Agency from adver-
tising reduces the opponunity that

Review responds 
Editor. 

How dehghtful , and unsurpris-
lng, that I should be attacked In the 
GuardIan after my graduation. Oh 
boy, Irashed by the Guardian . I 
guess I've made the big time. 

Matt Smiley seems to have some 
serious problems with some of the 
Ihings that I said in my an/cle 

"Paning Shots" for the june Cali-
fornia RevicIN. Let's examine a few of 
them. shall we7 

First , I was accused of being 
"deliberately sarcastic." Matt , of 
course It was deliberate. There isn't 
any other kind of sarcasm. A more 
pertinent question would be whe-
ther the author of the critique of 
the California Revlcw was being 
deliberately dumb. If he had bo-
thered to check he would have 
found everything I ever wrote In 
the ReVIew or In the Koala was sar-
castic. HIS discovery IS the equival-
ent of pointing out that a CIrcle IS 
round 

Then my JOining the Army comes 
under attack Mr. mile), asserts 
that I would be better off JOIntng 
some son of computer firm thaI 
would benerappreCiate my "binary 
mentality." A good phrase, Mr. Smi-
ley. It IS as clever as It IS intellectu-
ally bankrupt, which IS to say very I 
suppo e the binary commem was 
alludmg to my black-and-white 
world view. Do I really see the 
world as black-and-white like Mr 
SmIley suggests? You bet I believe 
there I eVIl out there. I believe that 

no mailer whal problems this great 
COUntry of ours has that there arc 
ot hers out there who are truly evil , 
ot hers who murder for money and 
power. Others who enslave their 
people through totalitarian dicta-
torships and lock them behind 
iron curtains guarded by barbed 
WIre, land mines and ma hine 
guns. Bla k-and-white, good and 
evil Do I see things that way as Mr. 

miley says? I plead guilty. 
There are a few other things 

about hIS anicle which I would like 
to ment ion He asserts , believe It or 
not , that the Guardian is somehow 
unbIased and obJectivc. Oh Christ, 
that's a laugh. What about the spc-
clal "We Love Communist Nicar-
agua" and the Angela Davis checr-
leading issues, not to mention the 
shnllleftism of thc editorial pages? 
See Matt, that's why I callcd the 
Guardian a wimpy would-be liberal 
rag - that's why even the leftist 
radicals on thc new indicator can't 
stand it. You guys are on the left, 
but you aren't willing to come our 
and admIt it. 

Lastly, and I think fairly dispi-
cably, Mr. Smiley questions my 

Independent Suspension. 
What it did for the car, 
it now does for the 
tennis shoe. 

1"ht K 1110 rnumphr , .. 

A simply constructed, conventional ten-
nis shoe is fine as long as you stand still. 

a body joint, smoothly mimicking your 
foot's flexing action. 

But when you flex your foot to move, 
something's got to give. When flexed, 
conventional shoes distort to the point 
of sloppiness. 

We solved the problem by dividing the 
upper into two parts. When you go up on 
your toes, this "action hinge" works like 

~~ Kaepa. Sav" Kay-pa" 

It's like independent suspension on 
a car. 

You get quicker, easier, more precise 
footwork. And comfort that lasts five sets. 

So if there's any danger your next oppo-
nent will cause you to move now and then , 
get the tennis shoe that has moving pans.

jOining the Army, cautioning me 
that it Isn't going 10 help me in the 
future because there aren't any 
more cute little wars to fight. Unlike 
Ihe ca reerist liberals that seem to 
permeale UC 0 , 1, and many other 
young conservatives, feel proud to 
give ourselves to serve our country. 
Mr. miley. I could have gotten a 
good job with my grades and cre-
dentials, but I chose instead to "ask 
not what my country could do for 
me, but what I could do for my 
country." Yeah , I know you people 
don 'l understand thaI. You have 
your law schools 10 get into, your 
BMWs and CD players to buy. 
There Isn 't any tllnc to do some-
thtng for your country, no room in 
your busy careers for self-sacrifice. 

Of the three biggest conserva-
tives on campus, myself, the edl-
tor-i n-chlef of CR and ex-Senator 
Greg MacCrone, not one is out tn 
the private sector. Two of us arc in 
the Army and MacCrone is in 
Africa with the Peace Corps. Isn't it 
ironic that only the conservat.ives 
seem to be answenng the call of 
liberal presidemjFK? 

Lastly, let me say [hat CR has 

been left in good hands and WIll 
continue to expose the leftist 
hypocrisy that infect UCSD regard-
less of all the attacks it suffers. My 
advice to you young conservativcs 
out there is get with CR: It's a great 
experlencc and a lot of fun . 

And yes, Mr. Smiley, you arc cor-
rect in assuming that I worship 
Ronald Reagan.

Survey charts UCSD's AIDS awareness 
By KRISTEN McCLEARY 
Ftatu res Editor UCSD AIDS Survey Results 

dent safety. yenhllls stressed that a 
change In behavior IS the only way to avoid 
sexual contamination on a large scale , 
remarking thar some of the people who 
were aware of the dangers of the disease 
still had more than one sexual partner and 
did not necessarily usc condoms during 
sexual intercourse as a preventive mea-

From the condllm vending ma hines in 
campus restrooms to news abour the latest 
research at the UC 0 Medical Center, to 
the diminishing use of the phrase "one 
night stand" in ollege clr lcs, II'S be om-
Il1g increasingly clear th3t the AID virus IS 
haVing a Significant Impact on. the UCSD 
communi ty. 

Lasr spnng. a student intern with the 
tudent Heatlh ervice (SH ) decided to 

monitor and measure UCSD student alti-
tudes tOward AIDS as well as Ihelr knowl-
edge of the disease. Susie Nyenhuis. a bio-
chemistry major who has been a student 
health advo ate for two years , spent the 
quarter planning and admlnlstenng an 
AIDS awareness survey to 220 undergrad-
uate students. Over the summer he comÂ· 
piled her data and anal>'zed the findings 
whereby, he explained. the "I SHSI could 
targer groups of people who were mlSInÂ· 
formed or uninformed and educate them 
(about AID )." 

What NyenhUIS found was an atlllude 
prevalent among college students which 
she refers to as the "Immortality complex" 
"They I students J hdve a tendenc), to believe 
that things Will always be as they are now. 
It\ a short range thinking It's difficult to 
edu ate people on things that they don't 
think will affect them."she said 

According to NyenhUIS a persistence In 
the bellef that AIDS IS a "gay disease" and a 
behefby some thar"those Infected with the 
\lruS someho\\' de cr\'Cd It ." were eXisting 
and dangerous misconceptions "There's a 
lot of homophobia out there In SOClcty." 
she said. 

Tho"e found to be least Informed about 
AIDS were a group of college freshmen . To 
Increase the now of information targeted at 
thiS group. H puts AID brochures Into 
the dorm packets handed out at the 
beginning of the quarter They also pro-
Vide speakers to lecture on the Issue at 
e3ch dorm. 

But information alone IS not enough to 
combat the spre.ld of AIDS and assure stu-

I . It would bother me if I knew 
that the student sitting next to 
me carried the AIDS virus. 
2. I am afraid of getting AIDS. 
3. 1 am inclined to limit my sex 
ual activity to only one partner. 
... I approve of homosexual rela 
tionship berween consent 
ing adults. 
5. Medical science will find a cure 
for AIDS within the next 5 years. 
6. UCSO students experiment with 
iUega I IV drugs. 
7.1 fear that I may have been 
exposed to the AIDS virus. 
8. It is what people do, not who 
they are, that puts them at rislt for 
AIDS. 
9. If I were to have sex with a new 
panner, I would insist that a con 
dam be used. 
10. I would be embarrassed to ask 
a date about his/ her chancn of 
canying AIDS. 

Â·denotes correct response 

"[Students] have a 
tendency to believe 
that things will al-
ways be as they are 
now. It's difficult to 
educate people on 
things that they don't 
think will affect them"

urI'. 'There are over one million teen preg-
nancies every year. ThiS shows two things. 
One. they Iteensl arc not uSing condoms 
and, two, they're not being responsible. 
A.IDS can be spread through this popula-
tion tOO easily." Nyenhuis said. 

College is a time when people are at one 
of the highest risks of contracting the dis-
ease. The fastest growing group of AIDS 
patients has been identified as the years 
from 24-29. Given a 5-7 year latency 
period this information means the people 
are becoming infected and exposed to the 
virus from the ages 19-24, during the col-
lege years. "The experimented attitude of 
college students combines with their 
immortatlity complex to make this a very 
dangerous age . [Studentsl gamble their 
lives in the heat of passion," she said. 

yenhuis suggests that the best protec-
lion against AIDS remains abstinence. or a 
completely monogamous relationship, pro-
vided. of course, that neither parmer has 
been exposed to the AIDS virus previously. 
"1 don't think enough is said about absti-
nence . In younger age groups it shouldn't 
be stressed when you have sex, but r3ther 
that it's a hoice to have sex or not to have 
sex." yenhuis added. 

The SHS will be talking more about pre-
venting AIDS dUring the seventh week of 
fall. UCSD's AIDS education work group 
will be sponsoring the first AIDS Aware-
ness week :It this time. 

Last March . the number of heterose ual 
AIDS cases equalled that of the homosex-
ual population five years previous. The 
rapid spread of AID into this larger popu-
lation group wornes Nyenhuis .. ,\ don't 
think people are going to change or listen 
senously to what health educators say until 
AIDS becomes real to them .. . by then it will 
be too late."

boxes of raspbeITIes. 12 papayas,

Mia Vaughnes listed a .recent 
delivery for the Food Co-op's new 
fruit cart: 

"This is organiC fresh frull," said 
Vaughnes, "grown and harvested 
without any synthetiC pesitides." 

Vaughnes, a senior Poli tical 
Science and Economics major, 

"After a few years 
at UCSD, I was 
ready to do some-
thing to bring 
about a sense of 
community here, " 

-Mia Vaugnes 
came up with the idea for a fruit 
cart last year. "After a few years at 
UCSD, I was ready to do something 
[0 bring about a sense of community 
here," Vaughnes said. Friends had 
told her about the successful fresh 
fruit can al Sa n Francisco State. On 
what many see as a healthÂ·con-
SCIOUS campus, Vaughnes felt that 
the same Idea would go over well at 
UCSD. 

Vaughnes surveyed 150 UCSD 
students for their response to a 

fruit cart on campus She also 
compared the market pricing, qua-
Ilty. and availability of fruit In other 
stores "Ninety percent of the peo-
ple supported the idea." Vaughnes 
said. "Even though it was a small 
sample. there was a proven de-
mand ." 

.. 

Last spring Vaughnes took her 
idea to the Associated Students 
(A.S.), shOWing that her plan would 
be "operationally feasible." She was 
[Old that. as an independent ven 
dar. the plan would nOt work. The

Tritons 
lose in 
overtime 

2-1 loss 
breaks 5-game 
win streak 

By MATT STEUERWALT 

It wasn't only the weather that 
was cold Wednesday afternoon. 

As the clouds blew over and the 
wind dropped the temperature. 
UCSD and C U San Bernardino 
fought out their men's soccer games. 
[n fact , there was more fighting 
than soccer in the first half. Each 
team had one yellow card; UC had 
13 fouls and CSU had 12. The Trit-
ons took one more shOt than CSU , 
but did not put one of their five 
shOts on goal. 

The second half was more of the 
same. As the weather got colder, so 
did the play. The ball went back 
and forth quickly, as each team 
looked for the one chance which 
would produce the winning goal. 

UCSD had several opportuni-
ties. They had more than enough 
free kicks, but couldn't execute any 
of the tough chances off their set 
plays. Several corner kiCks also 
went off the mark, as the offensive 
problems that have plagued the 
Triton men all year continued. 

But solid defense kept the game 
"careless. CSU only gOt off twO 
shots the enme second half. neither 
elf which was anywhere near the 
goal. 

Regulation time ended abruptly, 
.md seemingly early after the Trit-
on's best scoring chance of the 
game was saved by San Bernardi-
no's goalIe. With no score, the 
game went to overtime. 

Clockwise from left : Junior forward Erik Dingwall avoids two Cal State defenders in a Triton offen-
sive. Junior forward Scott Hyver looks upfield for a potential pass. Sophomore forward Scott 
Rommel (1111) slide tackles CSU forward. Bottom: Scott Hyver on another offensive maneuver, 

So the twO captains met again at 
t he middle of the field for the COin 
toss. UCSD won , but could nOt 
build an attack. The only time they 
spent near the goal was when ScOtt 
Goodman picked up his second 
"ellow card and was ejected. This 
Idt the Tmons to play onc man 
short. They managed to hold off 
San Bernardino, and the game 
moved Into the second overtime, 
.51111 scoreless. 

Despite the man disadvantage, 

UC finally heated up for the 
second overtime. They kept the 
ball at the CSU end, gelling a 
comer kick. When the ball bounced 
free , Mike Lodoen took cpntrol and 
found Daln DeForest in front of the 
goal. DeForest drilled a shOt which 
took off through the heavy crowd, 
and was past CSU's goalie before 
he could react 103 minutes into 
the game , San Diego had the lead. 

Unfortunately for them, SOCCer 
overtime IS not sudden death. With 
only seven minutes remaining be-
tween them and a loss, 17th-ranked 
San Bernardino put on a desperate 

Make a great

willi La Paz 

attack. Only four minutes later, 
they gOt the equalizer. It came 
again on a corner kick where the 
ball was free in the middle. Chuck 
Campbell managed to get a foot on 

it , and the ball slipped past a div-
ing Gary Stadler.

Playoff 
preVIew 
It's gonna be 
a close one! 

By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Spom Edilor 

Looking back at my pre-sea-
son preview (Guardian issues 
3/30 and 4/ 16), aliI can say is , 
"So, I was wrong, but damn, I 
was close!" [ picked the Mets in 
the National League East, the 
Reds in the West and the Blue 
jays and Royals in the American 
League. And wouldn't you know 
it, they all finished second. 

But now the regular season is 
over. Time to get down and 
dirty and start playing some 
ball. The playoffs: where the 
men are separated from the 
boys (as opposed to the World 
Series, where one team reaches 
immortality). 

The National League playoffs 
will be close: Two teams with a 
lot of power and a lot of speed. 
Already split at I-I, the series 
could go all seven games. The 
Cardinals are hoping for a 
speedy recovery from injured 
slugger jack Clark, who is out 
with a sprained ankle and not 
expected to return until at least 
game six, which could spell 
Giant viclOry. But don't count 
the Cardinals out yet. Between 
Vince Coleman and Ozzie 
Smith, they still have speed en-
ough for a track team and a set 
of hitters in Willie McGee, 
Tommy Herr and Terry Pen-
dleton that are just as capable of 
producing runs (if not moreso) 
than their leader Clark. 

The Cardinal speed also 
creates a superb defense, capa-
ble of closing gaps qUickly and 
holding down the number of 
extra-base hits. They did it Tues-
day and they Will , without a 
doubt, do it again throughout 
the series. 

So the Giants have their work 
cut out for them. They aren't 100 
worried about the speed. Giant 
catchers Bob Brenly and Bob 
Melvin have caught Coleman 
five OLlt of eight times during the 
regular season and Brenly caught 
him again in game one. As for 
offense, the Giants specialize in 
the long ball. They will rely on 
Will Clark and jeff Leonard 10 
provide the unnecessary punch 
to produce runs, and they won't 
be disappointed. It'll be close, 
but if I had to make a pick: 
Giants in seven . 

The American League playoffs 
will be filled with runs. Both the 
Minnesota Twins and Detroit 
Tigers are known for their power 
and with a possible four games 
in the Homerdome? We're talk-
ing football scores. And this one 
will be close too! 

In terms of post-season play, 
the Twins have been at home 
watching the playoffs at home 
for the pasl 15 years , while the 
Tigers have been quite involved , 
haVing been the world cham-
pions an i), three yea rs ago. The 
Tigers .Irc (II so t be f,Ivoritc due

San Diego Chargers 'rap' it up on the picket line 

Charger Strike Rap 
(Chorus) 
We're Charger players out on strike, 
Nor a silUation that we really Ii ke. 

In their boredom , unIOn football pla~rs have begun to express theIr co ncerns on the 
strike. So when 69 XTRA Gold's morning team, Bloom and Harrigan made our hometown 
San Diego Chargers a chance to vocalize their opinions, the Chargers didn't refuse. 

The result was the Charger Strike Rap. [nitially conceived by one of the mornin team's 
rew, thl? rap song was recorded last week by 20 players, in luding Gary Anderson, DenniS 

"Conan" McKnight , and Mark Vlaslc.

'Cause the NFL bargaining talks have failed , 
I'm hanging out grtting lots of sun, 

What I really want to do is ... hit, Hit, HIT! 

(TImmy Ware) 
I'm Timmy Ware and ['m bored to tears, 

No deal, no play! We're walking the incs; 
We're waving flap and picket signs, 

But what [ really want 10 do is ... RUN! 'Cause I'm walking the line and drinking some beers. ['m hoping the players and owners will agree, 
'Cause not playing football is bugging mel
