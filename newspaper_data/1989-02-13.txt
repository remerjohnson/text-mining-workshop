T J Assault Victim Posts 
Fliers To Find Witnesses 

By REBEKAH YOUNG 
Staff Writer 

A local junior college student 
who claims to have been the vic-
tim of an assault in Tijuana last 
month has posted flyers on cam-
pus in an effort to find witnesses 
to her alleged beating. 

ing Zoleski in the middle of the 
crowded bar's dance floor. 

"He was hitting and punching 
me and, after that, he started to 
strangle me," she said. "No one 
tried to break it up." 

"The place was packed and I 
heard these slapping noises," said 
Third College freshperson Jenni-
fer Dodson, who apparently 
helped Zoleski escape her attacker. Kelly Zoleski, a 27-year-old 

Grossmont College student, dis-
tributed, in late January, a flyer 
which claims the incident "escal-
ated back in San Diego, resulting 
in a broken nose and an arrest." 

The incident at Rio Rita's Bar 
and Restaurant, supposedly in-
volving Zoleski's boyfriend, 
erupted during the early morning 
hours of Jan. 28 when, according 
to Zoleski, "I was dancing with 
another guy and he tried to kiss 
me." 

"I saw a girl bent over in half 
and this huge guy was hitting her 
in the face and stomach, "she con-
tinued. "Then he grabbed her 
neck and started strangling her. I 
thought he was going to kill her. 
h was happening right in the 
middle of a huge public place. It 
was unreal that no one else would 
stop him."

ERRATUM 
In the Feb. 9 article 

"Nighttime Parking Pro-
posal Passes, " the Guar-
dian inaccurately re-
ported the Parking Advi-
sory Committee's activi-
ties. 

The Committee did 
not vote on a nighttime 
parking proposal. 

Instead, the Commit-
tee held a "straw vote" 
which determined that 
it would be likely to 
favor some form of 
nighttime parking pro-
posal. 

The Guardian regrets 
this error. 

"Jennifer sa'IICd me," Zoleski 
said, explaining that Dodson 
yelled at Suber to stop and swore 
at him, which distracted him long 
enough to let Zoleski escape. 

"There were guys all over the 
place," Dodson said. "No one 
yelled, no one dared get near [the 
attacker], he was so huge. People 
were looking but no one was 
responding. I was so di gusted, I 
thought at least I can yell at him." 

The attacker t'hen approached 
Dodson, but was stopped by two 
men. He allegedly threw the two 
men on a table, according to 
Zoleski: and started a larger fight. 

Amidst the confusion, both 
Dodson and Zoleski were able to 
slip away unnoticed and travelled 
by taxi back to the U.S.- Mexican 
border. 

Security guards restrained the 
attacker after he began to fight 
with other men, according to a 
Rio Rita's waiter who declined to 
state his name. 

The waiter confirmed the inci-
dent, saying that he "saw a guy 
beat up a girl [that night] and I 
saw that [same] guy get in a fight

When asked why the staff at 

Rio Rita's did not quell the out-

UC Officials HailDivestment Success 
By BRIAN HILL 
Staff Writer, Daily Californian 

BERKELEY - University of California officials 
have said the multi-billion dollar institution was 
able to meet its 1988 goal of divesting itself of one-
third of its South Africa-related holdings without 
having to sell a single stock or bond for divestment 
purposes. 

But student groups accuse the university of con-
ducting a phony divestment. 

After a long series of protests, the UC Board of 
Regents voted in July 1986 to sell one-third of its 
$3.1 billion of holdings in South Africa each year 
from 1988 to 1990. 

Under the plan, sales of securities for normal 
investment reasons count toward the divestment. 
total , as do investments in companies that withdraw 
from South Africa, UC systemwide spokesperson 
Rick Malaspina said. 

"As of Oct. 31 , 1988, a reduction of $576 million 
has been accomplished through a combination of 
ales of securities for investment purpose and the 

withdrawal from South Africa by everal compan-
ies," Malaspina said. 

Berkeley's Campaign Against Apartheid member 
Steve Swanson said companies the University claims 
to have withdrawn from South Africa haven 't really 
left. 

"I hope no one out there still believes divestment 
has taken place or is about to take place . . . They 
came up with a way to deceive and derail" the div-
estment movement, Swanson said. 

The UC Office of the Treasurer decides which 
companies have left South Africa based on a 
monthly list published by the Investor Responsiblity 
Research Center (IRRC) in Washington, D.C., UC 
Vice President Ronald Brady said. 

Meg Voorhes, assistant director of the IRRC's 
South Africa Review Service, said the IRRC has 
two categories for companies involved in South 
Africa: 

• "direct" - companies with investments or 
employees in South Africa; 

• "non-equity" - companies with ties to South

UCSD Begins Observance 
ofN ational Condom Week 

Valentine's Day Brings Heightened 
Awareness of Safe Sex Practices 

By DARCY GRIFFIN 
Contributing Writer 

« 

UCSD will observe National 
Condom Week on Feb. 13-17 
with a series of activities at each 
college. 

Revelle College will support 
the theme "keep a rubber on 
hand" with a fair in the Plaza on 
Valentine's Day. There will be an 
information booth, a condom toss 
and blow-up and two people 
dressed up as condoms who will 
give condoms away. 

"When we say 'give condoms 
away,' what we do is provide a 
little Valentine package with a 
Valentine, some kind of safer sex 
brochure, a condom sense card 
that explains how to use a con-
dom and a Ramse Extra con-
dom with spermicide for extra 
protection," Christine Oakley of 
the Student Health Center said. 

Oakley added that all other col-
leges will also make these pack-
ages available to their residents. 

The following week Muir cOi-
lege will show the film Condom 
Sense. 

Warren College will also pro-
vide information about condoms 
at its commuter luncheon in the 
International Center dining room 
today. 

"I think [Warren College is] 
even going to have some 'condom 
sense' T-shirts that people could 
order," Oakley said. 

UCSD's Lesbian and Gay Or-
ganization will join in the effort 
by distributing condoms and 
As orted Vinyl will give out free 
condoms with every purchase, 
according to Oakley. 

In addition, the Student Health 
ervice will provide literature on 
exually transmitted di eases, 

birth control and condoms.

Berkeley Students Offered 
Alternative Diving Course 

BERKELEY - While for most students the 
routine of going to class, the library and back again 
can become a bit dry after a few weeks, some students 
have found a class to help them avoid that problem. 

In Biology 407 - introduction to scientific research 
diving - students have ample opportunity to get wet 
as they learn diving skills in Speiker Pool and the 
Pacific Ocean. 

According to the UC Scientific Diving Club's fliers 
the class is "the oldest and most respected cuba ' 
training program in the nation." 

The diving program, which has certified 600 divers 
since its inception in 1967, focuses on the scientific 
side of diving, training students to conduct research in 
a~ aqua~c environment, diving officer and Berkeley 
biology professor Lloyd Austin said. 

The class, which currently has 40 students signed 
up for spring quarter i~volves two hours of lecture 
and four hours of pool laboratory per week with eight 
all-day ocean laboratories held throughout the semes-
ter, Austin said. 

When divers conduct research for a doctorate 
degree, Austin said, they often make as many as 400 
dives. 

The program has never had any serious safety 
accidents like decompression - loss of pressure in the 
scuba tanks - or death, Austin said . In the 20-year 
period there have been only three broken eardrums, 
she said . 

Diving in the ocean, according to Austin, is a 
thousand times safer than driving to the dive sites. 

Berkeley's diving program, which involves 210 
hours of study in the pool, ocean and classroom, 
requires periodic proficiency checks on the lifetime 
certification offered. Austin said. 

A diver can also-be certified to advance further than 
the depth of 25 feet at which most divers are initially 
certified. lb' Th' / . .

The Associated Students Internship Office (ASIO) 
pro.vides internship opportunities at the local, state, and 
natIOnal levels for both undergraduate and graduate 
students at UCSD. ASIO was established by interested 
students in 1979, and has been continually placing stu-
dents in internships ever since. The office is funded by 
the Associated Students, is student run, and therefore 
cannot provide academic credit. They are located above 
the game room in Student Center A. 

Deadlines 
If you are interested in applying for an internship in 

San Diego, the deadline is the end of the fourth week 
of spring quarter. If you are interested in applying to

Spectrometer Assembled at UCSD to Aid Research that "The finding makes our pro-ject more important. We will be 
able to look [at] pulse gamma ray 
[that is unique to a pulsar]. Also, 
the spectrometer will detect . .. 
strong magnetic fields, greater 
than anything else possible on 
Earth, that [are] usually associated 
with pulsars." 

By LOREN CHEN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD space scientists, in col-
laboration with researchers at UC 
Berkeley and two French institu-
tions, conducted the final assem-
bly of a new high- resolution 
gamma ray spect rometer on cam-
pus Friday. 

Scientists designed the spec-
trometer to find evidence of a 
spinning neutron star, a pulsar 
that was formed during a super-
nova ex plosion observed in Feb-
ruary 1987, according to informa-
tion released by UCSD's public 
information office. The team will 
also be searching for gamma ray 
emission that could provide evi-
dence of a black hole in the center 
of the universe. 

The instrument will be launched 
from Australia out of a high alti-
tude balloon in early March, and 
should remain in the air for two 
days , while it receives trans-
missions. 

The instrument's main compo-
nents are 12 Iiquid-nitrogen-
cooled detectors arranged inside a 
shield-like assembly of cylinders 
and wires. The entire instrument 
is mounted on a fi ve-foot-square 
cradle of aluminum tubing that 
forms the inner frame of the bal-
loon gondola. 

The project for building high-
resolution gamma ray detectors 
began in 1982, explained Jim 
Matteson, director of the project 
and research physicist from the 
Center for Astrophysics and Space 
Sciences (CASS). Scienti ts had 
developed a new technique for 

detecting gamma rays in such a 
way that a detector would react to 
even very weak signals originat-
ing many light years away. 

NASA funded this and other 
projects as part of an overall 
Support ing Research in Tech-
nology project to motivate var-
ious institutions to help further 
advances in space technology and 
the construction of new instru-
ments that would be useful in 
space research, according to 
Matteson. 

While the gamma ray spec-
trometer's purpose is to collect 
data, the researchers' ultimate goal 
is to create an instrument which 
can function in outer space. 

UCSD has co ntributed s ignifi-
cantly to the research of t he new 
gamma ray spectometer by pro-
viding CASS, which includes 
approximately 100 astrophys icists 
and other scientists, with re-
searchers, Matteson said. 

In 1982, the project for the con-
struction of the gamma ray spec-
trometer had the objective of creat-
ing better instrumentation for the 
detection of gamma rays when 
conducting tests in space. 

In 1987, the observation of a 
new supernova at a distance of 
170,000 light years, closer than 
any seen in 400 years, prompted 
NASA to ask Matteson and other 
scientists to use the gamma ray 
spectrometer to collect data with 
respect to the new phenomenon. 

A further goal of the gamma 
ray experimentation became the 
gathering of data in order to test 
theories concerning supernovas, 
according to a Feb. 10 New York 

Jim Matteson works on gamma ray spectrometer assembly. 

Times article. A major theoretical 
prediction is that a star, after 
undergoing the change to a su-
pernova, will give rise to a pulsar, 
a rapidly spinning and dense star. 

One goal of the new equipment 
would be to find evidence of 
gamma ray emission that is char-
acteristic of a pulsar, Matteson 

said. 
According to the Times, how-

ever, astronomers in Chile re-
corded light from a new star that, 
when later analyzed, was found to 
be that of a pulsar. 

When asked how the discovery 
would change the spectrometer 
project , Matteson commented 

The other goal associated with 
the project is the search for evi-
dence of a black hole at the center 
of the galaxy. At the galactic cen-
ter, reserarchers have, for some 
time, noticed peculiar gamma ray 
readings, according to Matteson.-

Matteson hopes that gamma 
ray readings from the spectrome-
ter will elucidate a situation where 
no one has a clear idea of what is 
happening and possibly provide 
an answer to whether there is 
a black hole at the galactic center. 

While the gamma ray spectro-
meter will function primarily as a 
data collector as it floats above 
the Earth, a main concern is its 
functionality. Whether it works 
feasibly in this experiment will 
decide if it / becomes useful in 
future space missions and other 
endeavors, Matteson said . 

DIVEST: Students Challenge Officials 
Continued from pale 1 
African firms for licensing, distri-
bution or supply agreements. 

Voohres said that most institu-
tions with divestment policies 
consider a fi rm to have left South 
Africa even if it still maintains 
"non-equity" ties. Brady said this 
is the University'S policy. 

For instance, the UC Office of 
the Treasu rer declared in 1987 
that IBM had left South Africa . 

Business reports show that since 
March 1987 there have been no 
IBM outlets in South Africa. 
Instead, the firm set up a com-
pany in the cou ntry and granted it 
sole license to sell IBM equip-
ment there. 

Voorhes said that non-equity 
agreements "in some cases . .. are 
crucial to the [South African] 
subsidiary's survival. 

"For instance, the IBM subsi-

diary does no manufacturing; it 
simply sells computers supplied it 
by IBM," she said. 

Brady said the University Re-
gents did not intend for the div-
estment to punish companies with 
licensing, distribution or mainte-
nance agreements with South 
African firms. 

"We cannot inhibit trade with 
South Africa through divestment.

Illegal Immigration 
The problem of illegal immigration from Mexico is receiving 

new attention, and a variety of "solutions" have been offered. 
None of these address the real problems, and none, despite their 
huge cost, will be very effective. 

One proposal is to build a ditch along the border to stop the 
smuggling of both drugs and immigrants. A more ambitious 
suggestion is the construction of a fence along the entire U.S.-
Mexican border - a reverse Berlin Wall . The ideas for financing 
all of this are even more ridiculous; for example, a fee for U .S . 
citizens crossing the border. The recent laws making employment 
difficult for iUegals in the U.S . are another barrier. 

All of these may make illegal immigration more difficult and 
dangerous, but they do nothing to remove the desire of many 
Mexicans to leave their country. This is unfortunate, but real 
solutions are more complex and will take longer - so it's no 
surprise that poLiticians and bureaucrats don't want to look for 
them. 

Last year there was some controversy over ads on the back of 
San Diego bus,es depicting San Diego as a city exploiting illegal 
aliens, and using them as slave labor. This is a superficial, even 
disingenuous, claim. If the illegal aliens weren't better off here, 
they wouldn't come. Their salaries here are several times what 
they'd make in Mexico. 

The reality is that iUegallabor underbids U .S . labor, and thus 
illegal aliens either displace U.S. workers, o r fo rce them into a 
situation of exploitation. We do have to protect our workers, 
however, even if it comes at the expense of the Mexican illegal 
immigrants. Our duty is to our citizens. However, the only real 
way to stop the immigration is to make staying in Mexico more 
desirable. This is a difficult, but not impossible, task. 

Mexico's poverty doesn't derive from a .lack of ~e~our~es . It 
has oil, and it has many attractions for tounsts. ~ut It IS c~lppled 
by a government which is riddled with corruptlOn and m.co~­
petence at all levels . It has a crus~ing debt problem which IS 
unlikely to be solved soon. Addressmg these problems has to be 
a U.S. concern; the chances for political upheaval and even 
revolution exist and such trouble would present problems to the 
U.S ., not the le~st of which would be a flood of refugees coming 
across the border. 

Pressure m ust be applied to move Mexico toward real 
democracy, to help them deal with their debt, and to remove 
the structure which forces even idealistic young civil servants 
to become corrupt because going along means getting along 
- and staying alive. 

If mtelligent action is not taken, the problem of illegal 
immigration will only get much worse.

Quality Health 
Care Provided 
Editor: 

We at the Student Health 
Se:vice do not find health care 
amusing; in fact we regard it as 
serious and satisfying and we treat 
our patients accordingly. To in-
sure that we provide the best care 
possible, we monitor ourselves 
through the activities of our 
Medical Quality Assurance Com-
mittee, we get input from the 
Student Health Advisory Com-
mittee (SHAC), we ask students 
to submit "Comment Slips," and I 
we conduct consumer surveys. 

For the past several years over 
90 percent of those surveyed have 
rated our services from good to 
excellent. The quality of care is 
high even though st rong demands 
are made on the staff during 
much of the academic year and in 
particular when illnesses such as 
the flu are of epidemic proportion. 

The lack of actual information 
along with propriety precludes 
comments on the three in tances 
cited in the Guardian (Feb. 6) 
from those stude nts and any 
others. While we're not heartened 
by complaints wedo regard them 

as an important source of infor-
mation to be used in our contin-
ual striving for high quality med-
ical care for the students at 
UCSD. 

Finally, since both the flu and 
colds are diseases which are caused 
by viruses, both take time to run 
their course. Neither makes al-
lowances for midterms. The staff 
of the Student Health Service can 
offer advice on how to minimize 
their discomfort and can check 
for and treat complications.

"Spirit" Means 
Many Things 
Editor: 

In a letter entitled "UCSD 
Lacks Spirit" (Guardian. Feb. 
6), Karen Rottman contends that 
the only way to show campus 
spirit is to attend sports events in 
the Triton Pavilion after the tradi-
tional Friday T.G. This is a very 
narrow definition of "spi rit," con-
straining enthusiasm to a strictly 
athletic setting. 

Student~ do not choose to 
attend this University solely to 
cheer for a Triton team; they 
choose this campus for its diver-
sity and quality education . Some 
come here to party, but they all 
start out with the grades to get in. 

Athletic sch'olars hips aren't 
awarded; and sports are only a 
small part of all the possible extra-
curricular activities offered here. 

True spirit is not epitomized in 
a high school pep rally, it is 
shown by students volunteering 
through the ASK program to 
tutor children in San Diego 
schools, by students writing for

enthusiasm toward anyone of the 
many facets of college life -
social, political, cultural, musical, 
athletic, academic .. . Let's not 
confine ourselves to mindless "col-

I personally enJoy attend ing 
Friday night games, but certainly 
not because that's where I have to 
go to fill holes in my social calen-
dar or to "scam," as Karen puts it. 
Furthermore, I respect those indi-
viduals who would rather go to 
fraternity parties or develop their 
social lives in some other way. 

Students at UCS D have the 
right to select what they will do on 
the weekends and how they will 
direct their lives. Hopefully, when 
we all look back to our days here, 
we will remember more than 
attending a sporting event or learn-
ing the rules to a game.

Co-ops Offer 
Alternative 

Over the next few weeks, in a 
celebration of democratic princi-
ples, you will be asked to sign a 
petition regarding the future of 
the current Student Center. With 
enough signatures we can place 
on the spring ballot for student 
approval a proposal to expand 
one of the best features of the cen-
ter: student-initiated, not-for-
profit, democratically managed 
co-ops and collectives. 

What compels us beyond our 
own idealism in drafting this propo-
sal is the fact that we are not a 
fringe group representing narrow 
interests. We are, together, the 
most utilized student services on 
campus. The last referendum 
proposing to convert the Stu-
dent Center into a center for 
cooperatives passed with 85 per-
cent of the student body in sup-
port. It is estimated that 3,000 
students pass through the Cen-
ter's co-ops each and every day. 
The time has come to build upon 
student sentiments by turning 
ideas into reality. 

We envision expanding the 
scope of existing services and offer-
ingadditional low-cost operations 
such as the following: a copying 
and print co-op, more and varied 
food services, co-ops for clothing 
(new and used), sporting goods, 
arts and crafts, auto repair, and a 
development center for co-op 
housing, etc. 

We also propose to add an 
academic component to the cen-
ter by offering courses for class 
credit in the history, global appli-
cations and future of coopera-
tive economics. We believe that 
democratically controlled work 
spaces and services are one of the 
keys to survival for the planet 
and that conversely many of our 
global ills stem from the non-
democratic decision making pro-
cesses of the corporate and govern-
ment elite. We oropose to affiliate 
our co-op / Student Center with 
the newly established University 
of California Center for Coop-
eratives operating out of UC 
Davis, in order to provide our-
selves the leadership and train-
ing to address pressing social 
concerns. 

Furthermore, we propose to 
hire administrative and staff sup-
port trained in cooperative eco-
nomics to help develop and sus-
tain the center's services. Our 
requests for such ' support have 
fa llen on deaf ears for many years 
now. The current Undergraduate 
Affairs _administration has been 
negligent in acting on the needed 
support, a nd the transience of 

StudentCenterdirectors (10 in the 
last 12 years) adds to the problem. 
Most of their attention has instead 
been directed towards the devel-
opment of a shopping mall now 
aptly named the Price Center. 

You might be surprised to know 
that all of these proposals can be 
accomplished in conjunction with 
a reduction of the University Cen-
ter Fee. That's right, we're not 
asking for more money, we're tell-
ing you that by reorganizing 
Student Center priorities we can 
lower the portion of the Univer-
sity Center Fee that has histori-
cally serviced the "old" Student 
Center. 

And while six dollars per year 
(reduction to S10.50 per quarter) 
might not be a huge savings, 
compare it to the $75 per year 
increase the administration forced 
upon students to service the new 
University Center, and then com-
pare the scope of the services each 
is proposing. 

If we students don't organize to 
meet our needs, what we'l get is 
the administration's view of what's 
good for us. A prime example of 
this is the new (High) Price Cen-
ter, previously referred to as the 
University Center before million-
aire retailer Sol Price bought his 
way into posterity. 

The Price Center was conceived, 
drafted, and packaged by the 
administration without regard to 
due process and campus election 
regulations. It was illegally foisted 
upon the student body for fund-
ing. Here's what happened: 

In spring of 1982, over two-
thirds of students responding to 
the college Review Committee 
questionaire approved of the 
Student Center AS IS (the high-
est approval of the nine services 
queried). A mere six months later 
Vice Chancellor of U ndergradu-
ate Affairs Joe Watson, lament-
ing the lack of a "first rate" stu-
dent center, convened a task force 
to give "serious and thoughtful 
consideration to how interaction 
among students, faculty and staff 
might be achieved." (Naturally, 
the new Faculty Club stands this 
rhetoric on its head .) Given that 
the students were to be taxed to 
fund this new "University Cen-
ter," we were graciously allowed 
two seats out of eight on the task 
force, chaired by current Stu-
dent Center Director Jim Car-
ruthers. 

The resulting proposal, poorly 
reflecting student needs, interests 
(and budgets) was made available 
for public review for the incredi-
ble duration of two days before 
Vice Chancellor Watson "fully 
adopted the conceptual founda-
tions" over the objections of 90 
percent of those students review-
ing the proposal. 

By spring of '83, after a nation-

OPINION 
wide search, Tommy Tucker was 
hired by the powers-that-be to 
implement the administration's 
University Center. Tucker ran a 
campaign which led to a referen-
dum on the issue. According to 
student activity procedures, new 
fees must receive 67 percent affirm-
ative vote from at least 25 percent 
of the undergraduate and gradu-
ate student popUlation. After an 
unprecedented five days of voting 
(there had never been before or 
since more thart two days allowed 
for voting), complete with (cur-
rent assistant vice-chancellor) 
Tommy Tucker's illegal elec-
tioneering song and dance, the 
res ults were in. 

In spite of the hard-sell cam-
paign, when faced with such an 
unimaginative, insensitive plan, 
students could manage only a col-
lective yawn. The required number 
of students (ailed to appear at the 
polls, plus the measure lacked the 
required percentage of affirma-
tive votes. Watson, in an amaz-
feat of democratic double 
standards, declared that the refer-
endum had passed with onlya 21 
percent turnout at 54 percent ap-
proval, failing the legal litmus test 
on both counts. 

The administration ration-
alized that the fee proposal was 
merely an increase of an existing 
fee, requiring lower percentages 
of turnout and affirmative votes. 
To no avail students countered 
that tripling an existing fee, chang-
ing the fcc's name, and reprioritiz-
ing the fee's purpose in order to 
construct a $20 million new com-
plex was hardly just a fee increase. 
But the bureaucratic juggernaut 
could not be halted. From start to 
finish, the new (High) Price Cen-
ter appears to have been an exer-
cise in cynicism, adding valuable 
resume lines for the career bureau-
crats at our expense. 

Is there any use in crying over 
spilled milk, or moaning over 
sour grapes? Not really. We surely 
hope it's possible to get some use 
and enjoyment from the new facil-
ity. But bear in mind many of us 
ha'te been taxed up the ying-yang 
for the privilege of munching stale 
tacos dished up by minimum-
wage bio majors at high-profit 
prices. 

Past and present mis-manage-
ment of the Student Center has 
certainly not served students' 
interests either. From the incep-
tion of the center to the present 
day, administrators responsible 
for allocating the center's budget 
have been guilty of misappropria-
tions . Past director George 
Murphy was fired in 1976 for 
"financial irregularities."

BEATING: VictimNeeds Witnesses 
Continued from page 1 

The waiter also mentioned that 
in the pa t three months there 
have been three or four beatings 
similar to the one on Jan. 28. 

"I've been working here for 
three years and I've been seeing 
these kinds of fights [in which 
men beat their girlfriends] here 
lately. I never saw that kind of 
thing until a few months ago," the 
waiter said. 

When the waiter reprimanded 
Suber for allegedly beating up 
Zoleski, Suber was said to have 
replied, " 'It's my girlfriend. I can 
do whatever I want.' " 

Zoleski is now pursuing the 
possibility of legal action against 
Suber. 

If the case goes to trial, it will 
not be for the alleged attack in 
Tijuana but for another incident 
that allegedly occured in the U ni-
ted States later that morning, 
according to Gordon Davis, the 
deputy district attorne as igned 
to pro ecute Zoleskj' ca e. 

About one hour after Zoleski 
returned to her home in La Mesa 
afterthe Rio Rita's incident, Suber 
allegedly walked into her home 
and assaulted Zoleski again.

"At about 3:30, he busted my 
door open and began kicking me 
and screaming ... He slammed me 
face first into the door'frame and 
that's how I broke my nose," she 
said. 

This second incident paralleled 
the assault in Tijuana earlier that 
night , according to witnesses. 

"There were three other guys 
besides me in the house," said 
Zoleski's roommate Vance Nolla, 
" but no one was helping her. 
They woke me up to ask Sean 
[Suber] to leave," added Nolta . 

Suber allegedly continued to 
attack Zoleski after Nolta told 
him to stop and then turned to 
attack Nolta. 

Nolta's girlfriend finally called 
the police. 

Officer J .e. Medero of the La 
Mesa Police Department re-
sponded to the call. 

After talking to the witnesses 
and seeing Zaleski, whose face, 
according to Medero, wa "quite 
bloody," he arrested Suber. 

Because Dodson 's phone 
number was lost during the alleged 
struggle between Suber and Zo-
leski's roommates, Zoleski posted 

.. 

fliers around the UCSD ca mpus 
asking witnesses to the Rio Rita 's 
incident to contact her. 

At present, Zoleski's case is 
being prepared and a preliminary 
hearing is scheduled for Feb. 15. 

"Evidence and testimonie will 
be presented for the first time 
then," said Davis, the prosecut ing 
attorney. 

Suber pleaded not guilty at 
both his arraignment and his 
readiness conference (at which 
time the defendant is given a 
chance to change his plea). 

The pleas, according to Davis, 
are "a matter of legal tactics --
they're waiting to see what kind of 
plea bargaining deal they can 
get." 

The preliminary hearing i not a 
trial , Joanne Todnem, an inves-
tigative specialist at the East 
County branch of the District 
Attorney's Office, stated. 

At the hearing. the judge "must 
agree tha t a crime occurred and 
that the defendant i the appro-
priate person to charge," Todnem 
said. 

Zoleski and Dodson will have 
to testify, she added, and a key 
witness will be Medero. the inves-
tigating officer. 

Suber's lawyer, AI Gossner of 
the Public Defender'S Office in El 
Cajon, said that he hasn't "devel-
oped a case yet" and that he has 
yet to talk to either the victim or 
the witnesses. 

The Guardian was not able to 
reach Suber for comment.

Restricti ng trade with South Af-
rica will probably be a federal 
government issue," Brady saia. 

But student activists disagree, 
saying the University's action 
undermines the goals of the div-
estment movement. 

"Complicity with the South 
African government has not de-
creased because the companies 
announce they have pulled out," 
said UC Berkel~y student Rhod-
ney Ward, who participated in 
the original divestment protests. 
"The University should insist the 
companies have no ties with South 
Africa." 

UC officials said the divestment 
goal was accomplished through 
the University's normal buying 
and selling of stocks. 

Malaspina pointed out several 
firms which have recently pulled 
out of South Africa including 
Merck and Marsh McLennan. 

According to IRRC Senior 
Analyst Alison Cooper, Merck 
maintains non-equity t ies, and 
"we've put Marsh McLennan in a 
special category of companies 
which won't tell us if they have 
non-equity ties." 

Malspina said the University 
has roughly $1 billion in South 
Africa related holdings remaining 
in five U.S. companies: American 
Home Products, Bristol Meyers. 
Hewlett Packard. Johnson &

Sexism 
Continued from pale 4 
Men back off and may say, 
"Fifty-six percent!They must have 
polled some really sick college 
men. I would never do anything 
like that!" 

Women may say, "Of course 
it's rape if I say no and a man 
continues to force himself upon 
me. I know that and I wouldn't be 
so silly as to blame myself for 

somethin~ that he nid." 
Well then, where would the 

researchers come up with 56 per-
cent? Why do so few women 
report rapes to authorities? Why 
do some women confide to a 
counselor that it took them a long 
time to admit that they were not 
responsible for their rapes, and 
that they need help in fighting 
feelings of Ruilt? 

and even in their own fa milieS 
that men are the dominators. 
Rape, is simply a form of male 
dominance and aggression. 

Society looks upon rape as the 
consequence of a woman's im-
modest behavior and women have 
accepted this view, as evidenced 
by their reluctance to admit that 
they have been raped. 

Really, the only way to change 
these views is to expose them, 
making people uncomfortable 
with them. Only then will people 
look on cultural biases against 
women for what they are. 

The term "first baseman"isn't a 
purposeful rejection of women at 
first ·base, but it continues the cul-
tural tradition of defining things 
in male terms. 

A wkward as words like this 
may sound, and despite the fact 
that they seem to only accentuate 
the differences between tbe sexes, 
our cultural biases are deeply 
ingrained within us

(The Bike Shop had been cooper-
atively run until the administra-

Your fees paid for that $25,000, 
and incidentally your fees pay for 
Carruthers' salary. Carruthers 
has just received an $8,000 raise 
(to $62 ,000 annually) for his 
"competent" management of the 
facility . The Bike Shop bail-out, 
as with the University Center, 
shows to what great lengths the 
administration will go to sup-
port their pet projects. 

Co-ops on the other hand are 
ystematically hassled for the ser-

vices they perform and have been 
increasingly burdened with artifi-
cia lly created infractions by the 
center's administration. Because 
of our autonomy and viability, 
student co-ops have been viewed 

Monday, February /3. 1989 7 

for some reason as a "problem" in 
the eyes of certain administrators. 
Every co-op has tales to tell of 
bureaucratic harassment and obsta-
cles placed in the path of what 
should be our natural and needed 
development. 

In light of all this, what we are 
asking for students to do is en-
dorse the concept of formally 
splitting the University Center Fee 
into two parts, one for us, and, 
alas, one for them. We can then 
create a new governing body truly 
in touch with student interests, 
i.e. wide-ranging, democratically. 
managed, affordable student ser-
vices. The bureaucrats have 
neither interest nor expertise to 
further this ambitious plan. It's 
up to all of us. Sign the petition 
and support it with your vote jn 
the spring. Together we can make 
a real difference.

How does this fit in with 
"fresh person?" By rattling offsta-
tistics like these, I may seem to 
simply fall into the trap of which I 
blamed others. A reference to 
rape arouses anger in women and 
men, a feeling of being blamed for 
a system that they have not 
created. 

A simple changing of words 
will not change the tradition of 
male privilege, but it can begin to 
awaken the consciences of both 
men and women to the fact that 
we take many ideas for granted 
without examining their bases.

markers and you have a 
great basic card . All it takes 
are some special words 
written inside and your love 
will be touched. 

• How about designing a special sweetheart basket L-________________ --.J 

• A great thing to go along 
with the card you make 
your sweet heart are some 
homemade cookies . Try 
your sweetheart's favorite 
variety. Make a batch ot 
dough and shape it into a 
big heart cookie. Write a 
message with frosting after 
it is cooked. Or even shape a 
batch of them into little 
hearts. Packaged in a color-
ful bag or plate makes them 
even more appealing for 
your love to eat. 
• Try buying two bright 

solid colored t-shirts (large 
so that it will fit both of 
you) and some fabric paint 
to go along with them. Wrap 
them up, give them to your 
sweetheart and plan a spe-
cial time when you can work 
on the shirt together.

your relationship. Try doing 
the basket on a theme. All 
chocolate or study food , a 
colo r or even a cartoon 
character. 
• Remember when you 

were little and you didn't 
have any money but you 
really wanted to make Mom 
and Dad feel special? Re-

member the coupon books you used to make 
them? Back then they were for cleaning your 
room, washing the car and doing the dishes . 
Why not do some like these for your sweet-
heart? Some new ones to add are a free back-
rub , dinner at your place, coffee on campus 
together, or make up your own from things 
that are special to you and your sweetheart. 
• Then there is always the time to be creative. 

Try making your love a card. It's really not 
that hard. Throw some colored construction

Film Club Produces Picture 
By ANDREA ADLEMAN 
Contributing Features Ed,tor 

A new club th i year ha proven t h a t "light 
camera, action!"doesn't 

pertai n exclusively to Holly-
wood. Complete with a pro-
ducer, di rectory, script writer, 
location crew, advertising staff 
and others essentia l to movie-
making, the film clubat UCSD 
has set out to produce movies 
created solely by stud"nts. 

The club, Hardcore Profes-
sional Film Productions, is 
serious about producing a 
high-quality film with a pro-
fessional attitude and com-
mitment to film-making. It is 
in the process of implementing 
the schedule it planned last 
quarter; not at week six of its 
plan, it is currently conducting 
auditions. 

The cl u b was t he result of an 
idea of graduate student Rico 
Martinez. Seeing the lack of 
large-scale undergraduate film-
making, Martinez contacted 
two of his undergraduate 
friends, Milton Fletcher and 
Michael Alberts, who are the 
producer and director, respec-
tIvely, of the film now in the 
makmg. 

The purpose of the club, 
which ha~ a work crew of 40 
tudents, i to provide "hands-

on experience in film-making,"

aid Muir ophomore Lorena 
David. David , an assistant to 
:;:;:;:;:;::,.:;:;:::;:;:~ .. the producer, attributed the 

need for actual experience to 
the fact tha t "mostly its theory 
[that is taught] at this school. " 

Practicing rather than theo-
rizing about film-making in-
volves a multitude of decisions, 
which are principally made by 
Fletcher and Alberts under 
Martinez's advice. The three of 
them recently chose the script 
for the upcoming film a deci-
sion process which led them 
"to evaluate what it was we 
were trying to do [in terms of] 
a film, and what kind of film 
we really wanted to produce," 
Alberts said. 

Script writer Justin Bookey, 
a communication major from 
Warren College, serves as the 
third chief decision-maker, 
maintaining creative control 
over his work. 

Bookey's script "stood out 
above all the other ones as far 
as originality," Alberts said . 
"It was dry humor, sort of an 
existentialist comedy about 
four prehistoric cavemen, a 
cavewoman and their re-evalu-
a tion of their own evolution." 

"It's a surrealistic, sort of 
theater of the absurd .,. type of 
idea," Fletcher added. 

The script chosen, the pro-
ducer and director turned to 
other aspects of their jobs. For 
the producer, that involves 
being "in charge of all the 
below-the- line production 
considerations," Fletcher said.

Unitarian minister, author, and actor Roger Greeley plays 19th cen-
tury orator Robert Ingersoll in his one-man show. 

19th Century Women and 
Children s Rights Speaker 
Resurrected 
By JULIE MUNRO 
Fea/ures £<iilor 

Mobs of people gathered to 
hear him speak out against child 
abuse and neglect. criticize fun-
damentalist religion, and promote 
equal rights fo r women and 
blacks. 

This was not an acti v i ~t of the 
sixties. As a matter of fa ct, he 
lectured on these and other is ues 
a century ago, in the late 1800s. 
His name was Robert Ingersoll , 
and one actor, Roger Greeley, has 
brought him back to life in a one 
man show. 

Greeley feels that though Inger-
soll 's lectures may be J 00 years 
old, they are still 100 years ahead 
of their time. 

Look out Jimmy Swaggart and 
Jim Bakker! 

Ingersoll alarmed the clergy in 
1872 with his first important lec-
ture, "The Gods," which plead for 
"reason, observation, and expe-
rience" as an alternative to reli-
gious beliefs and excesses. "It is 
grander to think and investigate 
for yourself than to repeat a creed 
. . . I look for the day when reaso n, 
throned upon the world's brain, 
shall be the King of King and the 
God of Go<!:>," Ingersoll argued . 

The clergy had good cause for 
worry, as Ingersoll had a lawyer' 
education and knew the Bible 
from cover to cover. He clearly 
expounded his point of view with 
confidence and humor. Large 
crowds gathered to witnesl> fun-
damentalist leaders challenge 
I ngersoll, orne of whom even 
attempted to convert him. He 
debated as many as 26 fundamen-
talist ministers before sizeable 
audience . He confronted state 
laws prohibiting blasphemy, but 
managed to avoid jail by an-
nouncing to a Delaware audience 
in which fundamentalist ministers 
and the chief of police waited LO 
be given grounds to arrest him, "I 

do not know why they wish to 
throw me in the penitentiary when 
they know what I shall have to 
endure in the next world. That 
should satisfy them, I think." He 
was not arrested . 

Great crowds gathered to be 
entertained by "the great agnos-
tic." He held no malice toward 
Christians, but encouraged his 
audiences to question blind faith . 
He promoted humanist ideals, 
opposition to superstition, con-
cern for the welfare of others, 
independence, liberty of thought, 
and individual creativity. 

Sreeley was brought to town 
by The Humanist Fellowship of 
San Diego and spoke to a scatter-
ing of people in a theatre at Uni-
versity Towne Center on Satur-
day night. 

Ingersoll was the "most poplu-
lar orator in the United States," 
Greeley said . There have been 
seven biographies written about 
him, and seven collections of his 
writings publis hed . Ingersoll 
spoke to four million people, and 
"had standing room only audien-
ces wherever he spoke," yet he has 
bee n nearly erased from U.S. his-
tory, said Greeley, a former his-
tory teacher. "Why was he forgot-
ten?" Greeley queried. "Because 
he was anti-clerical," he said. 

To Greeley, a Unitarian minis-
ter, religion is "the quest of the 
highest values of life and the pur-
suit of a life according to those 
values." Be is a humanist. 

Ingersoll advocated the "reli-
gion of humanity," and ridiculed 
t he superstitions of which he 
believed a large part of funda-
mental ~ ligion was compo ed . 

When asked what he thought of 
baptism With water, he replied, 
"Baptism? With oap is a good 
idea. " 

He summed up traditions of 
various religions such as Lent and 
Pas over as "bad cooki ng." He 
also believed that olemnity wa 
not necessary to contemplate 

See INGERSOLL, pI,e 9 

The VCSD Guardian 

Ingersoll 
Continued from pace 8 
philosophies and ideas. I n fact, he 
said "olemnity is the key to 
believeing anything without evi-
dence." 

Ingersoll said "I do not attack 
people, but certain ideas, because 
I think they are wrong ... 1 have 
nothing but sympathy for the 
victims." 

Greeley pointed out that Inger-
soll was anti-clerical, but had a 
deep sensitivity for human feel-
ing. Ingersoll once said that, to 
him, religion puts dimples on the 
cheeks of the tenement dwellers. 
Religion creates a world where 
children are no longer afraid of 
their parents and do not have to 
work, he said . 

Ingersoll argued that women 
had just as much right to vote as 
men and that they were not the 
intellectual inferiors of men. He 

Jelt that allowing women to 
become educated would not be 
dangerous, but instead "men are 
generally ignorant and it will not 
do for [a wife] to depend on her 
worst half." 

He pointed out that a man 
could d ivorce a woman who 
committed adultery, but that a 
woman could not divorce a man 
who committed the same offense. 
"Most of the divorce laws are 
absurd or cruel," he cone1uded. 

When people called for a return 
to traditional values, Ingersoll 
agreed wholeheartedly, pointing 
out that our founding fathers 
believed in a strict division of 
church and state. 

They hesitated to make even 
Thanksgiving a national holiday, 
for fear that it may have been seen 
as having religious implications. 
They also debated that mail 
should be delivered on Sundays 
so as to avoid a religious bias, and 
that the word "God" should be 
kept out of the Pledge of Alle-
giance and other documents. 

Ingersoll loved liberty, which 
he defined as the freedom to do 
anything t hat does not interfere 
with the happiness of others. 

With regards to a club that 
would not grant membership to 
Jewish people. Ingersoll called 
the policy "bigoted, mean, and 
disgraceful." He insisted that every 
man has the right to be judged by 
his own merits. 

Film Club 
Continued from pice 8 
" I'm the person that tries to 
make available the resources 
for the director to use [as well 
as] overseeing the production 
so as to meet the schedule as 
best we clln. If things aren't 
going right, I have to come up 
with a solution relatively 
quickly.~ 

Alberts explained that as a 
director, his job is to transform 
the script, "to take the literary 
and turn it into the cinematic." 
He and the script writer mutu-
ally decide on all changes in 
the script. Because he oversees 
"the artistic, creative quality of 
the film," Alberts works closely 
with the cinematographer, 
camera crew, lighting crew, 
and other production workers. 

The expense of the film is 
estimated at $3,500. The film 
club received funding from 
Undergraduate Scholastic 
Grant, but the grant money 
does not cover off-campus 
expenses, so the club has turned 
to fundraising. One such off-
campus expense is the process-
ing ofthe film and ot her work 
that is done in Hollywood. 
Equipment for other aspects of 
production such as editing film, 
lighting, and camera and sound 
work is on campus. 

The movie will be in black 
and white due to the high cost 
of producing a color film. 

The first screening of the 
estimated 45-minute film is 
scheduled to take place late in 
spring quarter during the 
Und ergraduate Arts Festival. 
The club also hopes to enter 
the film in contests, a motiva-
tion for choosing the name 
Hardcore Film Productions. 

"The reason we chose the 
name ... is so that we can enter 
[films] in competitions and it 
doesn't say 'UCSD student 
film' on it," Fletcher said. ~[The 
name] is going to connotate a 
quality film. It is being made 
by students will be a definite 
bonus if it's real high quality, 
because people will be sur-
prised, and that will be in our 
favor. .. 

The film club was organized 
so that a final work is being 
completed on one film, another 
film with a different director

and producer can be started. 
At the beginning of each quar-
ter, meetings are held for stu-
dents interested in joining the 
work crew. The club does not 
require that students have 
experience in film-making . 
Instead , the more experienced 
members teach newcomers 
about the various aspects of 
film-making in a hands-on 
learning situation. 

Both Alberts and Fletcher 
have experience in independ-
ent film-making. Alberts, a film 
production major and Third 
College senior, has produced 
three films. He has entered his 
most recent film in several 
competitions. Fletcher, a 
Warren senior and media 
major, is in the process of pro-
ducing his first film which will 
be shown during the Under-
graduate Arts Festival along 
with the one he is working on 
through the film club . 

The film club undergoes a 
rigorous shooting schedule of 
14 hours for three consecutive 
days, proof that it is work, 
"not a kick-back, real lacka-
daisical thing. 

"We have a purpose for the 
club," Fletcher continued. "It's 
an educational experience. The 
benefits as we see them can be 
substantial for everyone in-
volved." 

"We want to keep [the film 
club] going," Alberts said. "We 
don't want it to die after we 
grad uate because we think 
we've started something that's 
beneficial to all students. We're 
hoping we can impress up on 
them the necessity for some-
thing like this so they will 
rejuvenate all the interest that 
we've put in it and keep it 
going."

EVERYONE TALKS 
ABOUT CHANGING THE WORLD. 

THIS YEAR 
3750 PEOPLE WILL 
ACTUALLY DO IT. 

Not everyone is cut out to change the world . After all, it takes education, skills 
and a spare two years. 

Also a w ill ingness to work. Hard. 
This year 3,750 Americans will join the Peace Corps tD do just that. They'll do 

things like build roads, plant forests and crops, teach English, develop small businesses. 
train community health workers, or even coach basketball. However. what they'll be 
doing isn't half as important as the fact that they'll be changing a little piece of the 
world . .. for the better. 

And when they return, these 3,750 Americans will find that experience doing 
hard work will have another benefit. It's exactly what their next employers are 
looking for. 

So, give the Peace Corps your next two years. And whi le you're out changing 
the world, you'll also be making a place in it for yourself.

Injury 
Continued from page 20 
your teamm;ltes play. 1 think I'm 
past the psychological part and 
now I'm getting into the physical, 
where Ijust have to overcome the 
lasl little bit. 

Q: Do you have any tricks for 
making rehab any easier? 

Winslow - I feel everyone 
needs a way of approaching goals, 
and my approach is to use faith . I 
don't mean everyone needs faith 
in a God, 1 mean faith in any-
thing, whether it be yourself, God, 
someone else, another higher 
being, whatever. But havmg a 
faith in something helps you 
along, gives you a positive a tt i-
tude ... well, as positive as is pos-
sible in the situation. 

Siljander - It's important just 
to keep going on. If you play 
sports, you are going to get 
injured. It's too bad it happened 
to me during a championship sea-
on, right before the playoffs. But 

I'm okay now, and it's better than 
having my arm amputated. Sports 

, are fun , and injuries are a part of 
it. 

Gerlach - I just focused on my 
last year. . .I said, "This is it. ~ If I 
don't moth· ate myself now, then I 
might as well not even play. If this 
had happened my first year 1 
probably wouldn't have pushed 
so hard to come back. 

Meier - When 1 get really 
frustrated Ijust go running or bik-
ing ... In a way that keeps me 
going. I have my goals set, keep 
working out, and keep thinking, 
"Yeah, there really is hope and 
I'm coming back." I've tried to 
think of any good that can come 
out of this . . .It's given me a lot 
more patience, and made me 
appreciate the game a lot more. 

Q: Can you describe the feeling 
that motivates people to get back 
into the game no matter what the 
cost? 

Siljander - You kind of get a 
feel ing like: "Oh gosh, they're 
going to forget me," even though 
you know they won't. I know 
they' I still invite me to parties, 
and it's important to know that 
they don 't forget you. I also think 
next year is motivation. I'm 
already looking forward to next 
year and another championship 
season. It was the greatest feeling 
runnini out onto that Held after 

The VCSD Guardian 

we won the Nationals, and maybe 
next year 1 ca n play all the way 
through. 

Gerlach - I just get a great high 
playing basketball. It's so much 
fun for me . . . that's the only rea-
son I play. It 's not the fame ... 
well, you don't get fame at this 
school. If I was playing at a big 
school [the fame] wouldn't be the 
reason, it's just a lot of fun .. . I 
have so much fun doing it. The 
whole scene, I just love it. 

Meier - 1 think it really is an 
addiction. You go through with-
drawal when you aren't playing. 
You go batty, climbing the walls. 
It's so much fun ... even on your 
worst days, thinking, "Would I 
rather have this worst day or not 
play at all?" You choose to play, 
because of a total love for the 
sport. You just have to do it .. . 
maybe its some gene or some-
thing. I think that a lot of times 
when people who haven't been 
injured get injured , they don't 
realize whal a psychological de-
pression and devastation it is. 
You can't do something you really 
want to do. It is so frustrating .. . 
the ultimate frustration. 1 always 
try to think of it as a character 
building experience. It really 
makes you try and grasp at what-
ever good there could be in it. It 
gives you a lot more appreciation

Rick Rupkey, Gary Fessia, and 
- if healthy - Kubinski . 

IfIack of depth is a problem for 
the pitching staff, it is certainly 
not the case with the position 
players. Despite having oilly three 
seniors on their squad, the Trit-
ons. with only one new player 
(Anthony Sanchez, a transfer 
from Laney Junior College) 
among their starting nine, have 
ex perience and talent which 
should be a major factor in the 
Tritons' success this season. 

The team Will be anchored by 
its seniors : Fessia, Brian Craw-
ford , and Jim Martinez. Fessia, a 
four-year starter in center field , is 
the team's offensive leader. A 
career .350 hitter, he led the team 
in home runs and RBis last year, 
and expects to do so again. Short-
stop Crawford was the team's 
leading hitter last year with a .409 
average. Martinez, a second year 
starting catcher with good power, 
will be expected to provide clout 
fro m the clean-up spot. 

The seniors will be supported 
by a strong cast of juniors. Out-
fielders Henry Jiminez and Chris 
Murphy both hit .299 last year. 
Dave Nowland , playing at first 
base, provides exceIJent defense 
and is beginning to hit the ball 
with more authority. Dave Lig-
erman and ophomore Matt By-
num provide great depth at third 
base as they compete for the 
position. 

Junior outfielders Kevin Gel-
bard, Rich Simpson, and 1 .J . 
Fisher are all fine athletes who 
give the Tritons additional depth 
and experience. Eric Judson, the 
team's lead-off hitter and catalyst 
who hit .395 last year, was ex-
pected to fill that role again, but 

I after breaking a couple of bones in his back, he will be out for a 
month. His returning, along with 
that of sophomore catcher Greg 
Northway, a transfer from San 
Jose State, will give additional 
support for the squad . 

If everything falls into place, 
the TrilOns should reach their 
goal of post- eason play. "We're

PHIL'S ANALYSIS .. , lfyou 've been on campus 
anytime during the last couple of weeks, you must 
have not iced some guys walking around with shaved 
heads. A new trend? I doubt it. Ridiculous? Quite 
possibly. But either way you look at it, the mere 
presence of the rookies and JV players ofthe UCSD 
baseball team, whether they play or not, are enough to 
make any opposing team pack up and hop back on th~ 
team bus. Hey, r even heard that some veteran players 
were shaving their own heads - because they felt like 
it. The skinheads won't back down for anybody, and 
Tuesday afternoon's content between ninth-ranked 
UCSD and Point Lorna Nazarene (2 p.m. , Olsen 
Field) should be a relatively easy one for the 2- J 
Tritons. Especially if Manager Lyle Yates decides to 
throw Mike Morgan (2~) again, who pitched a one-
hitter and struck out five in Saturday'S 4-2 victory 
over California Lutheran in the first game of a double-
header. But even if he's not pitching, the skinheads 
oughta be enough to scare 'em away, Phil advises that

nailed a shot to nearty the same 
spot in center field that Nowlan 
reached base on. Sanchez was 
able to pick up an RBI in the 
process, and forced Cal Lutheran 
to bring in a new pitcher. After 
Sanchez was caught stealing, 
however, the Tritons were not 
able to do any more damage in 
the inning. 

UCSD scored an insurance run 
in the sixth when Nowlan singled 
to left with the bases loaded after 
center fielder Gary Fess;:I was 
tagged out on a poor call at the 
plate. 

Morgan sent the Kingsmen 
down in order in the seventh, and 
the Tritons chal ked up their 
second win of the year. The over-

after the vict.ory. The lack of fans 
may have been felt by the Tritons 
in the second game, as two Cal 
Lutheran pitchers combined on a 
five-hitter to hand the Tritons 
their first defeat, 5-3. 

The Tritons scored first, how-
ever, when Martinez wound up 
on second after rocketing a shot 
down the third base line. H e 
scored when Ligerman singled on 
a hit-and-run. Right fielder Chris 
Murphy walked and advanced to 
third on yet another hit-and-run, 
and then Sanchez dropped a shot 
into right which scored Murphy 
and the Tritons held a 2-0 advan-
tage. 

But not for long. The Kings-
men came back in the top of the 
fourth, scoring four runs and 
impelling a pitching change from 
Gary Fessia, who started the 
nightcap for the Tritons, to Denny 
Kubinski. The action subsided 
until the top of the seventh , when 
Cal Lutheran scored once more

Pomona-Pitzer Beats Weary Tritons 

Women's Tennis Suffers 
Two Weekend Losses 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

There's an old saying that 
midterms and intercollegiate 
sports don't mix - at least 
around this school. Friday 
afternoon, the UCSD women's 
tennis team discovered that in 
a painful way when Division 
111 rival Pomona-Pitzer came 
to the Muir Courts and upset 
the Tritons in their first official 
match of the season, 6-3. The 
team may have performed bet-
ter as a whole on Saturday 
against Long Beach State, but 
the final result certainly did 
not improve as UCSD went 
down again by an identical 6-3 
score. 

"We should not 
lose to Pomona-Pitzer 
when we play them 
again" 

-Liz LaPlante 

On Friday, Triton top-seed 
Christine Behrens felt the after-
effects of an all-nighter study-
ing for a midterm when she 
lost 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 to Karen 
Nilsen of Pomona-Pitzer. Tri-
ton Nancy Calhoun, who had 

also been studying, suffered 
severe cramps and had to for-
feit her match with a 2-2 tie in 
the first set. With Calhoun out, 
Behrens was left without her 
usual doubles partner, and the 
Tritons were consequently left 
without a victory. 

"It seemed as if everybody 
had midterms this wt!ek," Tri-
ton Head Coach Liz LaPlante 
explained. "We should not lose 
to Pomona-Pitzer when we 
play them again." UCSD still 
has one more scheduled con-
test with Pomona-Pitzer at 
Claremont on April 7. 

On a positive note, fifth-
seeded fresh person Amanda 
Lynch battled back from a 5-2 
deficit in the third set of he ... 
match to win 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. 

On Saturday, a rested Beh-
rens was able to s-traighten 
things out and whip the top-
seeded player on Division I 
Long Beach State 6-0, 6-4. A 
sore but recovering Calhoun 
rejoined Behrens for the dou-
bles match which they won 6-
3, 7-f>. 

Unfortunately for UCSD, 
Cal State Long Beach played 
stronger down the line and 
came away with the 6-3 victory.

Women's Hoop Edges Asuza Pacific 
By CHRIS ZAHARIAS 
Stoll Writer 

Sparked by consistent outside 
shooting and a quick defense, the 
UCSO women's basketball team 
toppled the Azusa Pacific Cou-
gars 71-64 Thursday at the Triton 
Pavilion in a game UCSD was 
not favored to win. It was the 
tenth consecutive victory for the 
Tritons, a school recoT/i, bllt the 
streak ended the next night when 
they lost to Cal tate San Bernar-
dino, 80-74. 

From the start, it was clear that 
Azusa wanted to get the ball to its 
post players, but the Tritons (16-
5) would have none of that, forc-
ing turnovers and bad shots by 
the Cougars throughout the game. 
Eventually, UCSD ended up with 
14 steals, seven accredited to 
guards Nancy Caparaz and Tracy 
Ragatz who converted most of 
t hem into easy break-away layups. 

The Tritons took. the lead for a 
good eight minutes into the first 
half, building a 49-37 lead that 
put the game out of reach for 
Azusa's stifled offense. 

On the offensive end, the Trit-
ons' perimeter game finally came 
together, spreading out the Cou-
gars' defense and opening up the 
Tritons' inside game. 

Ragatz finished with a team-
high 17 points, including three 
from three-point territory, while 
Caparaz had six assists, many 
going to senior guard Beth Koe-
nig. Koening wound up with 15 
'points and seven rebounds, four 
at the offensive end. 

RJm. UzcJris/ Gua,dign 
Junior point guard Nancy Caparaz dished out six assists. 

UCSD's post players also made 
an impact, holding Azusa's Holly 
Ingersoll to 18 points, well under 
lier average. At the same time, 
Tritons Cari Young and Jill ](os-
ter dominated the boards, pulling 

- -

down 14 rebounds between them. 
Triton Head Coach Judy Ma-

lone commented afterwards, "We 
had some good shooting and 
Nancy Caparaz anticipated their 
passes very well."

Battle of the Campus Newspapers 

The Koala Scoops the Guardian Men's Tennis Downs Cal Lutheran, 7-2 
It wasn't pretty, but thecampus 

newspaper bragging rights finally 
belong to the Koala when, in 
front of a crowd of 50, a 15-11 
edging of the Guardian brought a 
week of anticipation, cockiness, 
and rumors to a close. 

All week long there were 
rumors, later discovered to be 
facts, that Koala member were 
actually practicing and had taken 
a trip to the batting cages to pre-
pare for the big game. Consider-
ing the Koala's usual disorderli-
ness, the thought of its members 

actually organized and serious 
about something was surprising, 
almost shocking. 

Saturday afternoon's softball 
game at Third Field, however, 
resembled omelhing closer to 
chaos and panic than organized 
ball - characteristics that were 
present even before the first ball 
was thrown out. Making a cameo 
apperance was The Jolt Guy, who 
pretty much set the tone for the 
entire constest when he screamed 
out the National Anthem over the 
sound system in a heavy metal 

Guardian AdvertiSing Manager Michael Foulks drills a shot down the

vein. Though the Koala and 
Guardian are not always on the 
best vf terms, any hard feelings 
disappeared once the game began 
and everybody seem to have a 
good time. 

The Koala, who scored in every 
inning but the sixth, was actually 
quite lucky to escape with the 
four run victory. If the Guardian 
(who had approximately 25 peo-
ple in its starting lineup) had 
bothered to play its women for 
the entire game, it would have 
been an easy victory. In the fourth 
inning, the Guardian women, 
bunching together an assortment 
of in field hits, Texas leaguers, and 
benefitting from a number of 
Koala errors, helped their team 
put together its best offensive 
inning of the day when four runs 
crossed the plate_ 

, 

But the day belonged to the 
Koala, even if it did only have one 
woman on the entire team and 
even though the umpire called a 
balk on pitcher Alex Pearlstein, 
allowing a Guardian run to score.

On Saturday, Feb. II , Cal 
State Lutheran was butchered 
6-3 by the UCSD men's tennis 
team . The No.2 player on the 
team, Hunter Galloway, won 
his singles match easily and 
then teamed up with his dou-
bles partner, Sig Huber, to 
trounce their opponents. The 
doubles duo of Galloway, who 
returned this week from his 
three-game suspension, and 
Huber are ranked fifth in the 
nation. 

What made the match par-
ticularly interesting was the 
poor sportsmanship displayed 
b y the Cal Lutheran players.

Brian Turner, Lutheran's No. 
3 player refused to wear his 
team jacket proclaiming, "I'm 
not wearing this jacket, our 
team is embarassing!" 

Obviously, the Tritons sin-
gles players were far too much 
for Cal State Lutheran. Fran-
cois Monnar, Galloway, Jeff 
French and Tim Ditzler all 
won their match es handily. 
Monnar claims that "the team 
is now on track. ~ All players 
are back from injuries and the 
lineup is functioning at full 
strength. 

Although the team's record 
is a mediocre 2-2, two of its 
games were against primarily 
Division I powerhouse oppo-
nents. On Wednesday, the 
Tritons host Cal State Bakers-
field at 3 p.m. on the Muir 
Courts.

softball game will probably occur 
sometime down the line, but after 
Saturday'S game, a bowling con-
test was proposed. Either way, 
look for more exciting campus 
newspaper action in the future. 

Guardian Photo Editor Kathleen 
Donahue, after a rough inning, 
makes the catch in left field. 

Injury 
Continued from page 20 
ketball in July. I worked out 
every day, and at first it was a real 
torture, but then it got easier and 
easier. Initially, I couldn't stand 
on my left foot at all. But then I 
made some progress, and when 
you can see the progress it makes 
it easier . There wasn't any pro-
gress at all in the first three week 
of rehab ... the mental part is the 
harde t. Every day I had to push 
myself harder and harder, make 
myself go to rehab, and some 
days Ijust didn't feellike[going to 
rehab]. The physical part comes, 
but the mental part making 
yourself go - is what's hardest.

injury) sets you back so far, and

Ninth-Ranked Baseball Opens Season at 2-1 
Strong, Veteran 
Offense Should 
Help Where 
Pitching Hurts 

By BRIAN ITOW 
Staff Writer 

Last year, the Triton baseball 
team had everything: a 25-12 
record and a top-10 ranking. It 
had everything, that is, except for 
the one thing it valued most: a 
berth in the NCAA Division III 
Western Regional playoffs. Des-
pite their record, their ranking, 
and an impressive post-season 
record which included a trip to 
the 1987 College World Series, 
the Tritons were snubbed by the 
NCAA selection committee for 
team ranked below them in the 
polls. 

Mike Morgan 
Hurls One-
Hitter at 
Cal Lutheran 

By CRAIG PETERS 
Contributing Writer 

Mike Morgan allowed only one 
hit and struck out five to lead the 
ninth-ranked UCSD baseball 
team to a 4-2 victory over the vis-
iting Cal Lutheran Kingsmen in 
its home opener Saturday after-
noon. The Tritons held a brief 2-0 
record, but fell to 2-1 when Cal 
Lutheran scored four runs in the 
fourth inning in the nightcap of 
Saturday'S doubleheader and then 
held on to a 5-3 victory in eight 
innings. The game was called 
because of darkness. 

With eight of nine offensive 
starters returning from last sea-
son's disappointment, UCSD is 
set to show everyone that it does 
indeed belong in a tournament 
showcasing the top teams of Div-
ision III. "The team has set a goal 
for itself: post-season play. We 
expect to get there," said Head 
Coach Lyle Yates. 

Mike Morgan's one-hit pitching left Cal Lutheran players a little out of focus on Saturday. 

The Tritons opened the scoring 
in the first game when they pushed 
two runs across the plate in the 
bottom of the second inning. It 
began when catcher Jim Martinez 
walked and Dave Ligerman ripped 
a double to the outfield, scoring 
Martinez. Ligerman advanced to 
third on an outfield error, and 
then scored on Dave Nowlan's 
sacrifice fly to give the Tritons a 
2-0 lead. All indications show that the 

ninth ranked Tritons will be there 
when the regular eason ends. 
They boast an experienced squad 
with a strong offense and solid 
defense. Their only question mark 
will be the depth of their pitching 
staff. 

The staff which was (at one 
time) the backbone of the team, 
has been depleted by injury and 
graduation. Junior Rich Tomo-

lonis underwent recent shoulder 
surgery and will be out until at 
least April. Two other talented 
arms have been plagued by injur-
ies as well. Freshperson Denny

Injuries: Recovery and Rehab 
By DAVID POTICHA 
Staff Writer 

Editor's Note: This is the third 
and final portion of this article. 

Q: What was your motivation 
for recovery? 

Winslow - I had a guaranteed 
contract. so it certainly wasn't 
money. Whether or not 1 played 
that last year I would have been 
paid. I simply didn't feel my career 
was over. I felt I was meant to 
return to the field. 

Siljander - I just wanted to 
play again, and 1 am already look-
ing forward to next year. 

Gerlach - I just wanted to 
play this last year. This is my last 
chance to play organized basket-
ball. I have no chance of going 
pro, and a very slim chance of 
playing in Europe because I'm 
not big enough and probably not 
even good enough. I just wanted 
to have one last year .. . to have 
fun. 

Meier - 1 Just wanted to play. 
I'm addicted to it .. . 1 love the 
team. I love competing and I 
know that we're a good team with 
a chance to win it thi year . . . and 
that would be great. 

Q: How hard is the recovery? 

Winslow - Recovery is far 
more mentaUy tough than physi-

cally tough. Depending on the 
degree of the injury, the physical 
part can be more or less difficult. 
With the physical part you can see 
day to day progress. The recovery 
progresses quickly, then slowly. 
You quickly work up to plateaus 
that are very hard to get over. 
Slowly, you work yourself over 
them, and then quickly hit another 
one again .. . most of rehab is men-
tal, since the physical part comes 
naturally anyway. You have to 
regain certain mental aspects, and 
need to continue to work hard at 
both the mental and physical 
rehab until you are totally re-
covered. 

Siljander - The worst actually 
has been not playing soccer. The 
only real pain wa early after the 
injury, trying to hold the arm in 
the shower. Rehab isn't hard yet, 
and the shoulder isn't that strong 
right now because I'mjust starting 
rehab. 1 can do a couple of push-
ups, but it feels uncomfortable. 
The shoulder will hurt even after 
running from the jarring caused 
by my feet. Now, I have almost a 
full range of motion in my arm. 
The only hard part is going to be 
getting back into diving (a a 
goalie). Intramurals are starting, 
but I don't know if I want to go 
out and start diving because I 
might land wrong and pop it out. 

Gerlach - It was hard at first 
and I did a lot of risky things. I 
started too early by playing ba -

them question marks. 
The anchor of the pitching staff 

will be junior Mike Morgan, 
who gave evidence of things to 
come with his one-hit shutout 

performance against California 
Lutheran University on Saturday. 
He will be supported on the start-
ing staff by junior college transfer

Two years ago, the Tritons reached the College World Series. 

The Kingsmen remained sub-
dued until the top of the fourth 
when a couple of walks, a wild 
pitch, and a force out led to their 
first run. With some excellent 
pitching, Morgan was able to 
strike out the next batter to make 
it one on and two out. With the 
count one ball and one strike, 
however, Martinez was unable to 
hold onto one of M or.Ban 's pitches, 
and the runner from third scored. 
The Tritons found themselves 
right back where they started, all 
tied up. 

In the bottom of the fifth, 
UCSD came back in shining form. 
Nowlan hit a solid shot to center 
and, on an error, reached second. 
Matt Bynum then grounded out, 
but not without advancing the 
runner to third. Anthony San-
