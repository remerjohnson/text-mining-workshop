VOLUME 56, #7 

By PHIL WlllON, Editor in Chitf 
It began in the winter of 1981 

when doctors in Los Angeles and 
New York noticed an unusual 
increase in the number of 
patients with a rare lung 
infection typically found in 
cancer victims and transplant 
recipients; only these new 
patients had two dis turbing 
common denominators: 
drastically deflated immune 
systems and homosexuality. 

The nation's first cases of 
Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome (AIDS) had emerged. 
AIDS has since mushroomed into 
epidemic proponions and today 
has srricken over 13,000 
Americans, including two UCSD 
students. As many as one million 
men and women now have some 
form of the AIDS virus. The 
number of cases doubles every 9 
to 12 months. 

There is still no cure or 
treatment for AIDS, with the 
mean life expectancy of those 
diagnosed with the disease 
leveling at 5 years; but hope and 
progress increase daily as 
researchers at universities and 
medical institutions across the 
country come closer to unlocking 
the mysteries of this new killer. 
At the UCSD Medical Center, 
doctors are trying to identify the 
initial causes and symptoms of 
tbe disease and are 
experimenting with various drugs 
aimed at treating the virus. 

AIDS research at UCSD, which 
includes almost a dozen 
infectious disease experts and 
$400,000 in state and federal 
grants, is just a pan of the UC 
AIDS Task Force that oversees 60 
AIDS research projects currently 
underway at UC San Francisco, 
UCLA., UCSD, UC Irvine, UC 
Davis and UC Berkeley. The task 
force is operating on a $5 
million budget supplied by the 
state and is asking for an 
additional $2.3 million for the 
next fiscal year. 

According to Dr. [)aug 
Richman, a professor of 
pathology who is working with 
AIDS victims at the Veteran's 
Administration Hospital, the 
virus still remains most prevalent 
among male homosexuals, who 
account for 78 percent of all 
AIDS patients in the country. 
Richman warns, however, that 
the disease is becoming more 
widespread among those who 
are sexually promiscuous, 
including heterosexuals. 

"The risks of sex have 
increased," said Richman, who 
has been studying the virus for 
the past three years. "While there 
is very little risk to a 
heterosexual with one panner, 
it's a great risk to have sex with 
sexually active people no matter 
what their sexual preferences -
but this has been the case with 
sexually transmitted diseases for 
eons."

Libraries to radio 
communicate 

The California State Library 
has awarded $16,300 of Library 
Services and Construction Act 
funds to the University of 
California Division of Library 
Automation (UC/ DLA). 

The award covers the final 
phase of establishing a prototype 
packet radio network consisting 
of a chain of six California 
public libraries extending from 
the San Francisco Bay Area to 
Sacramento. A personal computer 
will be installed at each site, 
modified to transmit data via 
radio instead of telephone line. 

Participating libraries will be 
selected jointly by DLA and the 
State Library, linked to each 
other, and connected to the UC 
library telecommunications 
network. This will enable them to 
communicate with each other 
and the State Library for 
electronic mail , interlibrary loan, 
reference question referral and 
access to the University of 
California Melvyl online catalog. 

Dean wins minorities 
fellowship 

Carolyn A Dean, a graduate 
student in mathematics at the 
University of California, San 
Diego, was one of 22 scholars 
selected to receive a grant under 
• new fellowship program for 
women and ethnic minorities, 
sponsored by UC President 
David Gardner. 

The program is designed to 
combat a ~serious lack" of female 
and minority faculty members on 
UC campuses, according to a 
statement from Gardner's office. 

Dean will receive $15 ,000 for 
one year to complete her 
doctoral dissertation. 

Mathematics Professor Lance 
Small, Dean's advisor, credits her 

BLOOM COUNTY 

with solving a complex problem 
that had been puzzling 
mathematicians for the last 
decade. An anicle by Dean on 
her findings will appear within 
the year in theJoumal of Algebra. 

Dean says she was originally 
an English major who hated 
math. 

She is concerned about the 
large percentage of women who 
arrive at college whom she feels 
are poorly equiped to handle 
calculus and other rigorous math 
courses. 

"I would like to see more 
women approach mathematics 
with an open mind. They have 
to grit their teeth and be ready 
to take calculus. It's too bad if 
someone goes into humantities 
just because they are scared of 
math," she said . 

Students to confer 
on nuclear issues 

The Education Abroad 
Program (EAP), UCLA. and the 
Institute on Global Conflict and 
Cooperation (IGCC) are 
sponsoring a seminar called the 
"Nuclear Arms Race - One year 
after Dubrovnik" on November 1 
and 2 and UCLA 

The seminar will review the 
material covered in last year's 
conference, "The Nuclear Arms 
Race - An American-European 
Dialogue" in Dubrovnik, 
Yugoslavia. Student panels will 
discuss: The European View of 
the Nuclear Anns Race; Strategic 
Defense Initiative (Scar Wars); 
Non-Prolifera'tion Issues; and 
Alternatives to the Nuclear Anns 
Race. Any interested srudents 
may apply to attend this 
seminar. Grants are available to 
students to help cover the costs 
of transportation, a hotel room 
and meals. Information and 
applications are available in the 
campus EAP oUlce and from the 
campus IGeC representative. 

FoTty students UC systemwide 
may participate in this program. 

UC students studying on the 
EAP in Europe, and European 
students, including some from 
Eastern Bloc countries, 
participated in the lO-day 
Dubrovnik conference last year. 

The purpose of the conference 
was to inform the participants 
about the nuclear arms race and 
European views regarding 
solutions to the problems 
presented by the confrontation 
between the superpowers, or 
between NATO and the Warsaw 
Pact countries. 

UC faculty, officers 
get raise 
The UniVt::rsiry of California 
Board of Regents approved new 
salary scales giving an 8.8 
percent increase to faculty and 
slightly less to major officers of 
the University for 1985-86. 

Effective july 1, 1985, 
professors at the assistant, 
associate and full ranks will 
receive a 5.7 percent increase , 
and a second adjustment of 
about 3.1 percent on jan. 1, 
1986. 

The 8.8 percent maintains 
faculty salaries necessary to 
attract and retain first-rank 
faculty, particularly given 
,California's high COst of living, 
according to UC President David 
P. Gardner. 

As of jan. 1, instructors with 
9-month appointments will earn 
$24,000 compared with $21,700 
in 1983-84. Assistant professors 
will be paid from $28,300 to 
535,400; the previOUS range was 
$25,500 to $32,200. 

For associate professors, the 
range win be from $33,500 to 
$+4,400 compared to $30,600 to 
540,800 last year. fun professors 
win earn from $40,400 to 
$68,000 compared to an '83-'84 
range of $37,100 to $63,500. 

The Regents also approved 
increases for President David P. 
Gardner to $178,200, up from 
5165 ,000 last year, and UCSD 
Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson 
who will receive $100,000, up 
from $92,000.

Aurora Evora has /xen selling flowers at UCSD for the past three years 

Flower Lady 
here to stay 
T HE AS COUNCIL unanimously accepted a 2,000 Signature petition 
Wednesday, October 9 
recognizing the ~valuable and 
necessary" services of Aurora 
Evora, the "Rower Lady." 

Before meeting yesterday, AS. 
President Mary Rose Alexander 
said the AS Council would vote 
on signing a contract with 
Aurora that would make her 
flower stand an AS enterprise. 
The contract would permit 
Aurora to sell flowers five days a 
week throughout the year. If she 
does not agree to become an 
enterprise, Aurora would be 
subject to a recently updated 
policy that permits her to sell 
only six days per quarter. 

Under the contract, Aurora 
would give 15 percent of her net 
income minus operating 
expenses, to the ASUCSD. 
According to Alexander, the 
contract originally proposed that 
she give 15 percent of her gross 
or full income, but was changed 
to net because Aurora said she 
could not afford to pay such a 
large amount. The contract is "aU 
based on Aurora's honesty," 
Alexander said. "We're not in 
this to make money." 

The new policy regarding 
vendors who sell on campus was 
issued by the Student Center

Office in September. The policy 
restricts vendors who come from 
off-campus to a six day per 
quarter limit. Gail Levin of the 
Student Center Office said the 

. policy was required because 
"sellers were getting out of hand 
and would not adhere to the old 
policy." 

The old policy regarding 
vendors has not been updated 
since the late 1960's, Levin said. 

According to levin, the theory 
behind the new policy is that it 
should increase the diversity of 
vendors coming on campus. In 
addition, the policy should give 
first opportunities to student 
organizations and UCSD 
departments selling items for 
fund-raiSing purposes. 

"Aurora has a following unlike 
the other sellers," Levin said. 
"Her stand, in my opinion, is 
very aesthetic. She's a campus 
institution." 

"Unfortunately, people get 
caught in the policy like Aurora. 
but you want to avoid that. I was 
hoping that something like the 
petition would ~ome up to keep 
her on campus. 

The Rower Lady was not at 
her stand this week because of 
the deliberation over the 
contract.

AIDS: From death to mass hysteria 
While visiting the East Coast's most hypersensitive city, New Yori<., 

last month, one of our editors was snuck by how the most cosmopolitan 
place . on me globe could so easily faU prey to sensationalism. Led by the 
hom-blasting dailys, the New Yom Post and Daily News, it seemed as if 
the entire populace of Manhattan and Queens would launch a midnight 
strike on Greenwich Village in order to cleanse their great city of 
nature's new mystery disease - AIDS. One could not pass even the 
most obscure newsstand without hearing some idle chatter ocnceming 
the potency of the killer; one woman was heard to say that after using a 
toilet the other night in a Lower West Side bar that people of mixed 
sexual preferences are known to frequent, she had developed a huge 
rash on her bottom, her teeth wre beginning to faU out, and the hairs on 
her anns were constantly standing at attention. All of these maladies she 
attributed to the qUick onslaught of AIDS, which she had read only a 
few hours ago "could kill a person in a matter of days, as the virus 
develops as quickly as a fresh rose under ultraviolet rays." 

The mass media's )Verkin of the AIDS issue has produced a second 
epidemic - a tidal wave of mass hysteria whose symptoms include 
osrrcism, blinding fear, discrimination and in some cases, violence. It is 
a fact that not everything is known about AIDS, and it is not uncommon 
for parents to be strongly protective of their children. Contrary to the 
misinformation the streets of America are laden with h~r, the 
transmission of AIDS is far from a bewildering mystery. According to a 
recent New York Tunes/CBS poU, 47 percent of Americans believe it is 
possible to catch AIDS [rom a shared drinking glass; 18 percent name 
coruaminated toilet seats; and 12 percent consider themselves 
susceptible (0 the virus through sharing a work space or, more 
amazingly, by a carner's touch. More astounding though, is a recent 
fmding by a Washington Post survey which found 34 percent of those 
questioned considered it unsafe to -associate" with an AIDS victim -
even when no physical contact is involved. The worst scenario of die 
illogical AIDS hysteria is the transference of the fear from parents to 
children. District 27 in Queens embodied this deterioranon of 
sensibility, as the fear of an AIDS-afllicred second-gradeT spurred an 
opening-day boycott of over 12,000 junior high school and elemenwy 
sttldents canying placards against other children. In fact, the second-
grader during his life span had not uansferred the disease to the omer 
two siblings in his family (who were born before his mcxher con.uacted 
the virus). 

Although authorities at me Federal Center for Disease Control have 
been at:tempting to dispel the panic, medical researchers use at times of 

caveats describing the disease such as "indicates", "may be~, '"very 
possibly alleviates", and "thus far", ha~ overshadowed their more 
definitive Slatements. Dr. Martha Rogers, in an interveiw with the New 
yortr Tws in September, reassured the public that AIDS epidemiologists 
at the FCOC "obviously believe the nridence thus far indicates mat 
transmission by casual contact wiD ~r occur." The most dred 
evidence thal AIDS can't be nansmiurd through casual conlaCt is that 
no one of me Camily members of the ll,OOO presently known victims 
has developed the AIDS symptoms, nor are any known to be carrying the 
virus (with the exception of sexual parmers and children inflicted in the 
womb). Rogers also noted rhat it you cannot catch the bug alter years ot 
hugging, kisSing, sharing food, utensils, and bathrooms with a carrier, 
chances are virtually nil mat you will catch it sharing the same work 
space with someone. 

The cases that remain open, or those that are unaccounted for, are 
the ones mOst frequently used by skeptics who dispute doctors 
projections. Admittedly, to percent of juvenile and 6 percent of adult 
cases still remain unc.overed Adult cases will remain open as long as 
their mouths are ~ shut.. The suspect routes of transference -
most nocably engagement in .sexual activity with a prostitute or 
homosexual activity - ~ flO( the son of practices a family man or 
supposedly devocm gay or .SU2iglu lover is likely to tell their spouse or 
significant otheT about. Slcqxic.s will also claim that since the AIDS 
incubation . od - from infection to diagnosis - is generaly one 
year for ~ and two )aI'S for adults, who can say that some 
seemingly absurd method of ~ (like casual touch) won't show 
up as a true way of conlraCting the virus in a f~ yeats? Doctors reply, 

~ vety simple and. doc:umenred tenDS, that seriouS AIDS research has 
been under way for .se1/m )a.IS now, and if the disease was 
ttansmittabIe in otheT forms, men it would show up today. 

The nagrdy of the mass hyso=ria caused by media opportunism on 
the AIDS issue is that many propIc. borh young and old, are being cast 
as lepers by a supposedly sophisricalP(l SOCiety. Up until the recent 
confession and death of-supcrsuc Rock Hudson, the Federal 
Govanment bas vinuaIy ignoRd impassjomd pitas by AIDS victims 
and researches for ~ amount of help in d.c form of money_ Maybe 
now that bodt tletlOsnual and homosexual. socirrics aIilce are being 
stridcm. by the disease that money wiD. COIDt in bails. For as the me of 
AIDS deaths increases. so does the mass media's penchant for scIing 
grisly stories; the modem~y Ieptt colonies ~ not far behind.

... distorted visions 

By Jay Greathouse 
Everybody has the same tree 

growing in their front yard , but 
nobody pays much attention to 
it. Not until one branch" sticks 
out too far and maybe gets in 
our way a little does anyone do 
anything about it. A few 
motivated individuals wilt get up 
their courage and clean up old 
tools and get to work attacking 
the newly discovered ugly 
branch. Maybe they wi)) succeed 
in pruning the tree and maybe 
not, but in any case the tree will 
live on to grow new branches. 
No one thinks of attacking the 
roots. If this srory is tOo abstract 
for you, read, instead of tree , the 
nations of the world . For the 
ugly branch read the Union of 
South Africa. The motivated 
individuals are easy to see, even 
with the academic myopia 
induced at UCSD. What of the 
roots that nurture and support 
this tree? Read the culture of the 
United States of America. like 
the eu.calyptus trees on campus 
that pOison the ground against 
other trees, the United States' 
culture also poisons the Earth 
aginst other cultures to the threat 
of nuclear war and total 
destruction. 

What's wrong with apartheid? 
Don't you like cowboy stories 
anymore? Has the myth of 
winning the West lost its zing? 
Tired of the good guys in the 
white hats always winnin~? It 
has ,gotten a little bori ng, but 

after-all, the "Spirit 01 America" 
was forged by those hardy 
pioneers subduing the vast 
frontier, removing those heathen 
savages at the risk of their own 
lives. How else could America be 
made safe for our way of life? 
Cenainly it was our moral 
Christian duty to spread the 
good word across Europe after 
we showed them how to win 
WWII. Cenainly it was best for 
the Third World to enjoy the 
benefits of our Great Myth for 
the sake of their own 
development. Why blame the 
Union of South Africa for doing 
a better job than most in 
following in our steps? 

So none of us concerned 
Americans are going to vacation 
in Sun City, South Africa this 
year. Let us switch on the tube 
and vicariously join Matt , Doc 
and Festus over in the 
Longbranch during Gunsmoke; 
better yet, let us sit in with Kirk, 
McCoy and Spack in front of the 
Big Screen on the Enterprise as 
the drama of the universe 
unfolds in our laps. 

Wake up, it is-your culture 
that instigated and validates 
apartheid in South Africa as it 
strives for the "American Dream." 
The future weighs heavily on the 
putveyors of you who support 
them with your dollars at art 
galleries, bookstores, record 
shops and movie theaters.

doing what looks like a 
combination of tai chi and Jack 
LaLanne exercises on the gym 
steps. They number much fewer 
than the modest, benign crowd 
watching them. This is supposed 
to be a play about apartheid but 
there's no scenes or dialogue or 
characters or anything - it 
looks like an audition for the 
Whatever School of Holistic 
Spiritualiry. .

Nazi Statement 7 
Editor: 

Over the entrance to the 
Auschwitz extermination camp 
was the ~rman phrase, "Argeit 
macht frei ," which translatea 
means "Work makes men free ." 
The work demanded of the 

prisoners was not useful work, 
but rather an absurd display of 
wasted effort. Prisoners were 
ordered to pick up .heavy stones, 
run 200 yards with them and 
then return for more stones. If 
they did not run fast enough , 
they were flogged . A prisoner 
might be ordered to dig a hole 
large enough for a grave and 
upon completion be shot and his 
body thrown into the finished 

product. The work of the 
prisoners was an insane 
simulation of real work. Work 
meant being worked to death, 
and the only freedom was the 
freedom to die. To believe that 
the phrase "Albeit. macht frei K is 
in some way a tribute to the Nazi 
War Machine is to believe that 
the pr:soners' labor resulted in 
some useful and worthy product. 
"Albeit mach! frei " is not a salute 

to Nazism but an ironic 
statement of the futulity of forced 
labor's sake and the madness of 
a sociery which encourgaes it. 

The Nazi death camps were a 
shameful crime against humanity 
and such a crime still exists . 
Who is to say that our work is 
any more meaningful or 
accomplishes any greater goal 
than our own destruction ? In 
what way is our labor any more 

worthy? 'Our labor, like that of 
the prisoners is slave labor. I 
urge the Israel Action Committee 
to investigate the exact nature of 
such a statement rather then to 
make blind assumptions based 
upon their own hatred . "Albeit 
Macht frei" does not condemn a 
race, it condemns us aU, for we 
are all carrying stones behind the 
gates of Auschwitz.

Seminar to feature 'Chiefs of Staff 
By Gayle Heinhberg 

T HE CHIEFS OF staff for Presidents Eisenhower through Carter will 
participate in a panel discussion 
at an academic symposium 
entitled "Twenty-Five Years of 
the PreSidency" to be held on 
the UCSD campus Jan. 17-18. 

"Never before have eight chiefs 
of staff been assembled together," 
according to Sharon Taylor, 
UCSD Extension spokesperson. 
"Also, they are no longer in 
office, so they can be more free 
with their comments and give a 
greater deal of historical 
perspective and insight." 

The symposium, which is one 
of the events being put on to 
help commemorate the 25th 
anniversary of UCSD, will 
include the discussion of such 
topics as the role of the chief of 
staff during such crisis times as 
the Bay of Pigs and the Iranian 
Hostage crisis. Participants will 
also discuss their evolving roles 
as chiefs of staff, "from public 
relations person to an important 
decision-making person ," Taylor 
said . 

The participants will include 
Sherman Adams from the 
Eisenhower administ.ration, 
Theodore Sorenson from the 
Kennedy administration , Harry 
McPherson from the Johnson 
administration , Alexander Haig 
and HR Haldeman from the 
Nixon administration, Donald 
Rumsfeld and Richard Cheney 
from the Ford administration-, 
and Hamilton Jordan from the 

Carter administration. 
According to Jacquie Scoones, 

public events coordinator for the 
25th anniversary celebratiOn, the 
project evolved from an idea 
brought up both by members of 
the UCSD communiry and 
members of the San Diego 
communiry who have no direct 
involvement with the university. 
"The symposium was born out of 
a joint cooperative effort between 
these groups," said Scoones. 

According to Taylor, Jerry 
Warren, editor of the San Diego 
Union , was very instrumental in 
bringing these people together. 
"By using his clout and contacts 
he was able to reach these 
people , something I would not 
have been able to do alone." 

"We are very exci ted because 
the participants seem so 
enthusiastic about this ," said 
Scoones, "When Jerry Warren 
contacted Bob Haldeman, Bob 

.told Jerry that he had been on 
the Board of UC Regents when 
UCSD was founded. Bob was 
very enthusiastic about coming." 

Since the time they were 
contacted, both Haldeman and 
Haig have been corresponding 
with the symposium coordinators 
offering advice in organizing the 
event, according to Scoones. 

The participants will receive a 
"small honorarium" for their 
participation in this event. 
According to Taylor, "It is far less 
than they usually get for 
speaking. They are doing this 
primarily because they believe in 

the event." According to Scoones, 
"The amount is on a par with 
what any other guest lecturer 
would receive if they were to 
speak at an academic event of 
this nature. The former chiefs of 
staff realize that this is an 
important historical event." Both 
the honorarium and the 
participants' expenses will be 
paid out of the 25 anniversary 
fund . 

"Twenry-Five Years of the 
Presidenrv" will be transmitted 
live, via closed-circuit television 
to San Diego public h igh schools. 
In addition it will also be taped 
by KPBS tor a delayed broadcast 
that night in San Diego. 

"The faculry are also putting 
together materials that will be 
useful for teachers in preparing 
themselves and their students for 
this event," said Scoones. After 
the symnposium, a chronicle of 
the proceedings will be 
published in a form not yet 
determined and provided to 
universities through the country, 
Taylor said . 

At this time there is no 
concrete schedule for the 
program as it is still in the early 
stages of development. The panel 
discussion will be overseen by a 
moderator whose name has not 
yet been disclosed but who has 
been described as a "prominent 
national newsperson." It will run 
from about 9:00-11 :00 on Friday. 
Later that aftemoon there will be 
a question and answer session 
i nvolvi ng the chiefs of staff in 

which members of the audience 
will be able to pa rtici pate . 

It is uncertain whether or not 
the chiefs of staff will be 
involved with the programming 
on Saturday morning. Most likely, 
professors of history and political

"We also teach them how to 
PUt on programs [hat are 
informative, educational and 
pertinent to this campus," said 
Busse. 

Counselors hired in 
connection with the Women's 
Center are expected to work at 
least 10 hours per weeek, five of 
which they are paid for. They 
meet once a week with Busse 
and receive interim trainings on 
such special subjects as 
assertiveness training or 
dormitory outreach. Similarly, gay 
counselors meet with Dr. Steve 
Brady. Dr. Bev Ha~u supervises 
the group leaders for Recovering 
from Eatin£ Disorders (RED). 

Six of th~ 15 women trained 
~n 1983 were hired, and several 
f~hers continued to volunteer in 
,"ne Women's Center. The 

science from UCSD will speak at 
that time, according to Scoones. 

·We are strongly committed to 
making seats available to off-
campus people as wen as those 
on-campus," said Scoones. a 

student organizations through 
which peer counseling is done 
aU welcome volunteers. Brady 
and Ha~u were enthused by the 
success of peer counseling based 
in the Women's Center, and a 
second training in January 19M 
included counselors associated 
with !AGO -(the Lesbian and Gal 
Organization) and RED, and 
brought in eight new counselors 
to the three student groups. The 
third training, held this month 
on October 25 and 26, willmix 
the various groups of trainees for 
the first time. 

"A common complaint on this 
campus is the lack of community 
feeling ." says Busse. She feels 
that a group of stUdents devoted 
to helping other students 
contributes to the beginnings of 
a campus community. "The 
administration (which is 
especially accused of insensitivity 
to students is supporting this 
program: the Reg Fee committee 
feels it's important ... . We're 
seeing cooperation between 
students, staff and the 
administration for a really 
valuable program."

AIDS: A Gromng Concern 
Continued from page 1 

Thus far the only proven 
method of transmission of AIDS 
is through the blood or semen, 
either through sexual contact, 
sharing of blood products (as in 
blood transfusions), sharing of 
hypodermic needles or being 
born to an AIDS victim, 
according .to Phyllis Spechko, an 
AIDS research nurse practitionel 
at the UCSD Medical Center who 
is working on several AID 
projects. Although the virus can 
be detected in most body fluids, 
including saliva and rears , rhere 
has yer to be a documented case 
where it was transmitted in these 
forms , she said . 

The AIDS VIruS is devastating 
to the body's immune system 
because it directly anacks the 
helper T cells, or specialized 
whire blood cells, invading them 
just as the hepatitis virus does 
liver cells. According ro Spechko, 
once the AIDS virus destroys the 
helper T cell it prevents the ceU 
from initiating all its immune 
system responses, and as a result 
the body is left wide open to 
opponunistic infections that 
often prove fatal. 

The virus also targets the 
central nervous system and 
disintigrates rhe victim's thought 
processes. How it does this still 
remains a mystery to scientists. 

"This VIruS not only inlects the 
T cells in the body but it also 
strikes neurological tissue," 
Spechko said. "We've seen men 
who have made their livings by 
being intellectuals in high places, 
at local universities and colleges, 
who have gotten this disease and 
completely lost the ability to 
think and take care of 
themselves. It's a vety sad , sad 
situation." 

For the past 18 months Dr. 
Allen McCutchan has been 
studying 250 gay men in various 
stages of infection and is 
"looking for both the virus rhar 
causes AIDS and also other 
viruses that may be contributory 
to people becoming ill before 
they catch the AIDS virus." 

"We are trying to document 
the natural history of the dIsease 
in the human body," Spechko 
said. "Before we know how to 
interxene with any scientific 
cenainty, we have to understand 
what the disease does to the 

body." 
The men involved in the 

three-year study have undergone 
in-depth physical exams, audits 
on both their medical and sexual 
histories, and are currently 
having weekly blood tests and 
counts that show the progress of 
the virus. , 

According to McCutchan . the 
test groups are constantly 
monitored for any signals or 

symptoms of the virus, which 
includes fever, chills, persistent 
diarrhea, sweating, trouble with 
walking, vomiting, 'loss of 
appetite, memory problems, skin 
rashes and weight loss. 

"Some people have aU the 
symptoms, some only a couple," 
according to one of Dr. 
McCutchan's assistants. 
"Remember, the average 
incubation period for the virus is 
5 years. There are some people 
who, after coming in contact 
with the virus, become 
immediately sick within a week 
or months, and there are other 
people who carry that virus 
inside them for as long as 10 
years before they start getting 
any symptoms of the disease." 

Currently, screening tests exist 
for those in high risk groups 
who wish to be tested . A 
patient'S blood sample is 
analyzed for AIDS antibodies. 
According to Spechko, If 
antibodies are discovered , it 
doesn't necessarily mean that the 
person has the disease, only that 
they've been exposed to it and 
are considered high risk. 

"There are probably a million 
people in the United States who 
have been infected with the 
virus," said Richman, "However, 
to date there have been only 

13,000 people who have gotten 
true AIDS." 

Richman added that the fate 
of the million who are just 
infected is still unknown because 
scientists have only been 
studying the AIDS phenomena 
for the past five years. "We still 
don't know if they will suffer 
from the disease in, let's say, 10 
to 20 years," he said. 

A glimmer of hope ha~ 

Carlos Nelson (above), 
co-chainnan of rAGO, 
says that ·AIDS has 
drasticallY altered the 
sexual practices of gay 
students, and UCSD's 
search for a cure hits fu ll 
stride (right). 

appeared from another study 
that is just beginning this month 
involving the drug Ribavarin. Dr. 
Richard C. Straube, a Medical 
Center speCialist in infectious 
diseases, is initiating one of the 
nation's first tests with the 
experimental drug whIch has 
already proven it can stOp the 
virus In a laboratory 
environment. He will be 
administering the drug to 
potential AIDS victims exhibiting 
no more than one symptom of 
the disease. Live virus acquired 
from patients' blood will be 
grown in labs and additional 
samples cultured to diagnose the 
drug's effect on the human strain 
of the virus. 

In August, when it was first 
announced that the drug would 
be tested , many AIDS sufferers 

had hopes of taking pan in what 
could be the first effective 
m:aonent for the fatal disease . 
Straube was unable to include 
them in the study, however, 
because he felt his team would 
not be able to get valid results 
due to their physical 
complications. 

"We have to design a tight 
study using the most likely group 
to give us a valid answer," 
Straube said. "We do not want 
our study to lead to discarding a 
drug that might be the magic 
bullet. 

"As far as the pressure from 
members of the AIDS community 
to administer the drug to them, 
as a scientist there is a cenain 
procedure that must be followed 
or your studies will lose quality 
and effectiveness." 

Similar tests arc being held at 
Cornell University in New York, 
and another half-dozen drugs are 
being studied at different 
universities across the nation , 
Straube said. 

Because of its apparent 
adverse side effects, Ribavirin 
has yet to be approved by the 

Federal Food and Drug 
Administration , forCing some 
prospective AIDS patients to 
Mexico where the drug is readily 
available. 

"Every drug has its side 
effects, and because we have 
never given Ribavirin to a patient 
in such high doses as it takes to 
control the AIDS virus, we're not 
sure how the drug is going to 
affect the body," said Spechko. , 
"We do know that It can cause 
mental confusion, gastric stress 
and also anemia." 

According to Straube, even if 
the drug does stop the disease 
researchers are still not positive 
the victim will recover. He said 
that their hope is that the victim 
would eventually build up 
enough healthy T cells to combat 
the AIDS virus. once it is 

stopped, but there is no 
evidence that exists indicating 
that this is possible . The results 
from his experiment will be 
announced in nine months. 

A[DS is no longer something 
that happens to other people; it 
has hit several UCSD students in 
the past few years and accordig 
to Student Health Center 
officials, it will only get worse . 

According to Dr. John Giebink, 
acting director of the Health 
Center, TWO students were 
diagnosed with AIDS last year 
and were redirected to the 
Medical Center. 

[t's not a problem by any 
means," Giebink said, "But we 
are still beginning a drive to 
educate students about AIDS. 

"The only problem of public 
conern is the recent hysteria. 
AIDS is not communicated in 
any casual way, and [ see no 
health danger in having student 
victims anend normal classes." 

Many of the researchers and 
doctors agreed that the 
nationwide AIDS panic that has 
surfaced has no true basis and is 
doing more to harm progress 
than anything else. "The 
heterosexual population does not 
need to be concerned about 
sitting next to an AIDS patient in 
class, or eating next to one in a 
restaurant," said Spechko. 

According to Carlos Nelson, 
co-chairman of UCSD's Lesbian 
and Gay Organization (LAGO). 
AIDS has altered the lives of 
many homosexual students. 

"People have limited their 
sexual behavior, especiaUy the 
number of panners," said Nelson , 
who admits he has become 
more sexuaUy cautious. "[ think 
gay people are' now more 
inclined to get involved in a 
relationship and be 
monogamous." 

Nelson, who has taken the 
AIDS screen test that proved 
negative, said even though he 
doesn't have the disease it's still 
something that is constantly on 
his mind . 

As for current research and 
public awareness, Nelson was 
dismayed about the reasoning 
behind the recent surge in AIDS 
hysteria . "Only when non-gay 
people started getting it did people 
stan saying, 'God , we bener take 
care of this right away.' I really 
lelt I was the shit of society; that 
because I'm gay I don't count as 
a person; that I don't get the 
same attention that other people 
do." 

By PHIL W1LLON, EdllOr In Chief 
John Lounsbuty is a celebrity. Just last week he was 

interviewed by 60 Minures , the San Diego Union and 
Channel 10 because of his AIDS and his unique ability to 
talk to people about It. 

"If I can help humanize this disease mlm I'm probably 
getting more out of it than what they're getting out of me. 
My main purpose is to make it easier for the other patients 
as they come along not to have them go through the stigma 
and hatted and hysteria that I've gone through in the last 
few yurs: 

Living an hour 
at a time 

track 01 time when I'm painting and J totally lose track of 
the disease. I get wrapped into the painting; it's fantastic . 
It's a whole side of myself that I never knew existed. 

"My family has been vety supportive and my panner in 
life has stood by me since day one. If he hadn't [ don't 
think [ would have made it. Our relationship has actually 
grown and become close because of it. It's incredible the 
good things that come out of tragedy." 

He was wid he had the disease inJuly 1983 after going 
to his doctor to take care of an ear infection that never 
cured. It was a bit of a fluke that he got the disease, since 
he had only three previous sexual panners and has been 
with his current one for the past six years and because he 
had never used intravenous drugs. "I've never lived in the 
fast lane so I was very complacent. It can't happen to me; 
and yet it did: 

John goes to Mexico for his injections of ribavirin 
because it's not available in the US, because it is stiD being 
t£Stcd by the Food and Drug Administration. 

There are some possible side effects - including 
anemia - but he felt it was worth risking. "For the fi rst 
rime in twO years I have hope; I'm feeling better most of the 
time. I'm by no means over the disease, but things are 
lookig up." 

Before John contracted the disease he was a self-

Artist and AIDS victim, John Lounsbury. 

proclaimed workaholic, handling aU tanker shipments for 
Exxon in the Gulf Coast. He hasn't worked for almost two 
years and now spends most of his time painting and 
writi ng. 

"You live life an hour at a time," he said. "llotaUy lose 

The recent surge in research and public awareness has 
helped people understand the intensity of th is epidemiC, 
he said; but there is still a long way to go. 

"People have got to realize that this is a disease of 
human beings, it's not a disease of test tubes and Nobel 
Prize winners. The best thing people can do for AIDS 
victims is show compassion and love, and don't be afraid. 
Don't be afraid to touch us; don't be afraid to be in the 

£ same room. This thing is not spread by casual contact so 
~ just use some common sense as opposed to hysteria ." 
"i. John says he's a very spiritual person, and that this has 

helped him through the paSt two years. Even though some 
"fundamentalists would say, 'God gave the disease to 
punish you,' well I figure that, yes, God gave me the 
d i.sease, but not w punish me; he has given it to me as a 
lesson. I figure everything is a lesson - good or bad -
and the important thing is that we \earn from these 
lessons. I don't know exactly what the lesson is in this 
pan icular case - yet." Ii:J

A Playoff for your Thoughts 

UC Watennen 
Punish 
Occidental 

By DAVID TEDROW, Staff Writtr 

T HIS YEAR'S TRITON water polo team is capable of big things. When they play 
well, they are an impressive team 
to watch , but when they play 
poorly, they can be beaten by 
anyone. The Tritons played up to 
their potential, however, and the 
result was a 19-3 thrashing of 
Occid ental. 

The Tritons have been 
struggling of late . In the previous 
twO weeks they managed only 
two wins while lOSing four 
games. In the Triton losses, the 
team was repeatedly undone by 
its own play. As a result, coach 
Denny Harper had the Tritons 
wolking extra hard in the week 
leading up to the Occidental 
game in order to wolk out these 
mistakes . 

The extra work was apparent 
in Saturday'S game. On offense 
the team moved the ball wen 
around t~e perimeter and made 
Crisp passes into the hole. In 
addition, the player's moved well 
without the ball and worked 
hard to get open, creating many 
scoring opportunities. 
Improvement was also seen in 
the Triton's defense as they 
made only necessary fouls and 
didn't give Oxy a man-up 
advantage the entire game. Their 
defense also relentlessly pressed 
Oxy all afternoon, forcing many 
turnovers and counterattaCk goals 
by the Tritons. 

The Tritons staRed the game 
in high gear, and by the time the 
first quarter was over, UCSD had 
built up a 5-0 lead. The offense 
this quarter was as balanced as it 
could be with Tom Moore, lany 
Sanders, rodcl Sells, I'eter 
McConnvile and Phil Pettis each 
scoring a goal. 

It was more of the same in the 
second quarter which was 
highlighted by Jeff Smith's 
counterattack goal , Sander's 
second goal of the game and a 
Jim Torres bullet-like shot past a 
helpless Occidental goalie . Many 
fans were disappointed, however, 
as Triton goalie Duncan Millar 
lost his bid for a shut out 
midway through the quatter. 

In the second half, the 
swimming that UCSD had been 
doing every day paid off as 
Occidental struggled to simply 
stay afloat. In this half, Pettis and 
Moore scored two goals a piece, 
and Sanders added his third goal 
of the game. In addition , Jo and 
Greg Wade got into the act in a 
big way with Jo scoring three 
goals and Greg adding two of his 
own. 

When the finat gun (which 
was the only thing able to stop 
the Tritons aU afternoon) 
sounded, the team had swum to 
its largest win of the season. 
How did Harper have his team 
celebrate this big win? By having 
them swim 2000 yards after the 
game. Water polo is heU. 

The team has twO important 
matches this week. One this 
afternoon at 3:30 pm against Cal 
State Los Angeles , and another 
tomorrow at 3:30 pm against 
Chapman . Both games are at 
Canyonview pool across from 
Warren Field. E:J 

Surf 
Continued from page 10 . 
heard warnings about the sharks, 
but were not intimidated . 
Besides, in two months of 
surfing, they never saw one. "But 
you know they're out there 
somewhere ," Johnson cautiQned. 

At Puerto Viejo on the 
Caribbean side, a local surfer 
invited the twO lads to stay at his 
house while they surfed the local 
beach break. A few miles into the 
jungle, Johnson realized what 
they had gotten themselves into. 
"This was the real thing," he 
said , ·complete with every kind 
of wildlife you can imagine the 
tropics would have." 

Costa Rica provided both of 
them with exactly what they had 
come in search of. Although they 
admitted that the Caribbean 

waves could have been bigger, 
they spent close to six weeks in 
Costa Rica surfing "Oawlessly" 
shaped waves, dining on rice 
and beans, saltine crackers, tuna 
fish , dry oatmeal and cervezas. 
Geth even met a senorita, sold 
his two boards and stayed and 
extra month . But the greatest gift 
they got was summed up by 
Johnson . ·You wake up in the 
morning with the smell of the 
tropics blown down by the 
offshore wind ," said Johnson , 
"and then you realize just how 
far from civilization you are , and 
you know that soon you're going 
to be out in perfectly shaped 
waves by yourself. That's why 
you do it all in the first place." 
And everyone knows that the 
greatest gift you can give a surfer 
is an unoccupied barrel, an 
offshore wind and an exotic 
atmosphere from which the stuff 
of surf sagas are made. ~

Blood Wedding 

An Arts Magazine Serving the UCSD Community 
VoL 10, No. 4 OcIDber 17, 198.5 

by arthur "'azar 
Fredrico Garda Lorca was an outstanding playwright 

whose plays are produced today around the globe. The 
Spaniard contributed to theatre what Salvador Dali and 
Pablo Picasso gave to art, remarkable expressions of 
popular culture and criticism. Lorca's work - which 
includes Blood Wedding, The Butterfl,'s Evil Spell, Yerma 
and The Bill, Club """pets - is compared to the plavs of 
Maxwell Anderson and Tennessee Williams. 

Americans don't see enough Lorca, partly because his 
Spanish-language plays are very difficult to translate 
without losing their beauty and poetry. But thanks to 
national grants and corporate sponsorships, there is now a 
volume of literature containing five Lorca plays in 
English. The new edition was translated by Michael 
Dewell and Carmen Zapata, two veterans of the stage and 
script. 

Lorca's new Blood Wedding is touring the United States, 
presented by the Los Angeles-based Bilingual Foundation 
of the Arts, and is scheduled to appear at UCSD's 
Mandeville Auditorium on October 20 for two shows -
a Spanish matinee and an evening show performed in 
English. Performing will be the orginal cast from the LA 
production, which received five Drama Logue awards for 
outstanding achievement in theatre last year. 

Bodas de Sangre (Blood Wedding) exposes the tragic 
experience that three adults share, each driven by passions 
that lead to his own demise. ULorca's work probes the 
Spanish woman's sexual desires, in conflict with her 
country's social mores and its culture of male 
domination," says reviewer Terry Fisher. In one scene, 
Leonardo - a lover - proclaims, uTo burn with desire 
and keep quiet about it is the greatest punishment we can 
bring on ourselves." DesiTe appears to be an important 
element in the play's theme.

The shock of PDQ Bach ronight at 8 o'clock 

LfJS Bach were alive today. he would be 300 years old. He would also 
sit down and have a long heart to heart talk with one of his descendants, 
PDQBach, and nnd him a job selling life insurance. Fortunatdy, JS Bach 
neveI" liv~ to see what his great~t-nephew would do to the fine name 
of Bach. nor would he have to endure the veneration given to PDQby the 
noted music historian. Profe55<X Peter Schikele. 

Professor Schikele has devoted his life to me study of PDQ Bach. the 
composer of such great works as "Hansel and Gretal and T ~ and Ali~," 
and a notebook of pieces written for thechambercalliopc. Ustening toa 
PDQ Bach album gives the sensation of stepping into the twilight moe 
and finding that Karl Haas, after- spendi.ng several years with a cue of 
advanced alcoholism and being placed in an asylum for extreme 
schizophrenia, has devoc:ed the rest of his life to the music department of 
a small school in the Midwest, researching a non-existent branch of the 
Bach family tree. 

This research has given Peter Schi.kele his alter ego in the persona of 
PDQ. Bach and also a recording contract for several albums which give an 
account of PDQ.' life. It is not really possible to describe what is 
involved with a perfocmance by the PDQ.Bach company because no one 
ever knows what to expect from Schikele's madness. At one PDQBach 
performance at Radio Qty Music Hall. Schikele made his stageenttance 
by swinging, ala Tarzan, fTom the balcony. The Intimate PDQBech is a 
live program that is derived from the records Schikele has produced over 
the years and will be performed tonight i.n Mandeville Audi.torium.

Gringos on the go 
by .teve hamilton 

My friends said: 
"Come on Steve - let's go 

to Mexico." 
I said, "OK" and forgot 

about it. A couple weeks later 
they called up and said: 

" We're going to Mexico 
tomorrow." 

"So?" 
"You said you wanted to 

go." 
"Yeah, when?" 
.. A coupla weeks ago -

we'll pick you up." 
(The last time I went to 

Mexico there were 11 of us 
loud gringos drinking and 
looking for a cheap strip 
show. We found it. No cover 
- but we had to buy $2 worth 
of diluted stale beer. One 
feisty dancer kicked me hard 
when I tried to run a hand up 
her leg. Later I found out that 
most Tijuana dancers are 
supposed to be female 
impersonators. ) 

There were four of us guys, 
and one guy's sister came 
along with two of her friends. 
We went in an old pickup -
girls in back, guys in front. 
We bought insurance at the 
border while a tire on the 
truck sitting next to us went 
flat. We parked and walked 
around downtown, the three 

girls strutting their white 
short-shorted mini.skirted 
stuff for the rich Mexican 
boys cruising Revolucidn. 

We went to the bar 
everybody goes to pretending 
to know Spanish - "JUAN, 
MAS CERVEZA" or "HEY, 
SENOR, UNA MARGARI-
T A." And there 's a tiled 
trough in the bathroom, the 
floor is slipery and angled and 
the sink has a four-foot hole 
under it. A bunch of frat boys 
were la\l8hing and yelling and 
singing frat songs at the next 
table, and I come back from

my head and pours some 
tequila down my throat and 
shakes my head almost off. 
Everyone laughed and 
clapped, even people wearing 
Hawaiian shirts that I didn't 
know. 

We left the bar and the girls 
wanted to shop. So we walked 
up and down the street while 
they looked for more mini-
skirts. I stood outside one 
place watching a small band in 
front of a restaurant. The 
three old musicians blew and 
hammered and pounded (the 
same way they had in 
1955/1965/1975) while 
women with oversized 

sunglasses and men with tank 
tops .carried pinatas and 
sombreros with their names 
sewn on the bill. 

Dirty buses and clean 
Accords passed. Across the 
street, a small Indian woman 
walked with her son a step or 
two behind. The tiny boy was 
wearing highwater pants, 
leather shoes, striped tucked-
in shirt and slicked-down 
hair. He carried a miniature 
guitar that he would strum 
while singing to the blathering 
hysterical delight of the 
Americans, who would 
shower him with their 
monetary affection . As 
mother and son passed a strip 
joint, its doorman/ barker 
stopped t'he boy and 
whispered something in his 
ear. The boy laughed and ran 
to his mother. 

An old woman with no legs 
pushed by on a homemade 
skateboard. She wore a 
Dodger cap. Tired donkeys 
painted with zebra stripes, in 
front of murals of Aztec 
warriors, stood on every 
corner - waiting with their 
tired owners for those who 
cherish pictures of themselves

by tanya hellinpon 
and marie bouetti 

Dear Martin, 
Saw your new flick , After 

Hours , last night. Great cast -
Griffin Dunne , Rosanna 
Arquette, Teri Garr and Linda 
Fiorentino, just to name a few. 

The story was promising: 
Paul (Dunne) portrays a 
young, unfulfilled and 
generally frustrated computer 
programmer who embarks 
unexpectedly on what seems 
to be a perilous and never-
ending adventure through the 
streets of SoHo. 

10 a cafe, Paul encounters 
an intriguing young woman, 
Marci (Arquette), who hails 
from SoHo . Arquette 
functions as the catalyst that 
brings Dunne's character into 
a sordid, confusing world 
popula ted with lonely, 
frustrated and confused 
individuals. Paul is trapped: 
He's penniless and unable to 
return home. During the 

course of a night, he witnesses 
a murder, a suicide, becomes a 
wanted man and gets plastered 
(literally), plunging into the 
depths of despair. This just 
isn't his lucky night. 

But Martin, we kept asking 
ou~selves , haven't we seen this 
set-up before? Maybe we're 
mistaken, but we have seen 
frighteningly similar circum-
stances. For one, Dunne's 
character resembled that of 
comedian Dudley Moore . 
And we just couldn't take his 
(Pau l 's) pred ic ament 
seriously - even when he, 
dripping wet from the rain, 
sought shelter in a diner, it 
just didn't seem real. 

Also, SoHo appeared 
surprisingly tame. Where was 
that true, frantic energy of 
SoHo? Here, the area was 
presented in such a way that it 
could have been mistaken for 
a set in Hollywood! 

This film had deep 
underlying meaning - you 

said 50 yourself. You had 
Dunne abstain from sex for 
eight weeks (the time it took 
for you to shoot the film) so 
that he would physically 
exhibit the nervous tension of 
his character. That quality did 
come across, but it was 
Rosanna Arquette who stole 
the show. She exquisitely 
exhibited the disturbing and 
dangerous signs of an 
individual enveloped by her 
own insanity . Nervously 
flitting about, her Marci 
exemplified the caged 
songbird , the doomed 
schizophrenic dreamer. 

Arquette's Marci hit the 
mark most of the other 
characters missed. Maybe the 
problem was with the cliches 
manifested in a sex-crazecl, 
sadomasochistic sculptress 
(Fiorentino) or the manic 
depressive ' 60s-holdover 
waitress (Garr). Something 
was lacking. The grit just 
wasn'r there. 

Insignificant 
Perhaps it was wrong to 

expect the raw energy of Mean 
Streets or the schizophrenic 
urgency of The King of 
Comedy? Even with the 
shortcomings, you're always 
the film aficianados' 
filmmaker. The editing and 
camera movement are a joy to 
see. When your camera 
swoops onto a ringing 

. telephone, one can't help 
being startled - now that's 
pure genious! 

Although we were slightly 
disappointed, After Hours did 
have its memorable moments. 
We will most certainly be 
awaiting your next cinematic 
oeuvre. 

Sincerely yours, 
Tanya and Marie 

Directed by Martin Srorcese, 
written by Joseph Minion, and 

Hours 
produced by Griffin Dunne, 
Amy Robinson and Robert F. 
Colesberry, After Hours is now 
screening at the Universic, Town 
Center 6 and other local theaters. 

by mikel toomb. 
A better name for 

Insignificance, at least in its 
San Diego debut, might have 
been Inconspicuous . Until it 
opens citywide tomorrow, 
Nicholas Roeg's latest film 
was being screened at a grand 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ -, total of one local theater--
that is, if you consider 
Carlsbad "local" - the 
Cinema Plaza 5. (Or, as the 
marquee bills the complex, "5 
Cinema Plaza Theaters S"j 
that's sort of like "20 Live 
Girls 20!") 

.. H.... October 17, 1985 

Of course, no matter how 
minimal the exposure, no 
Roeg movie could really be 
inconspicuous - or 
insignificant, for that matter. 
The man responsible for such 
works as Performance, 
Walkabout, Don't Look Now 
and the recent &d Timing: A 
Sexual Obsession has now 
undertaken an audacious 
project that brings together 
(in thinly disguised form) 
Albert Einstein, Marilyn 
Monroe, Joe DiMaggio and, 
for bad measure, Sen. Joseph 
McCarthy. (The middle two, 
of course, were already 
together at one time.) 

It's a remarkable, albeit 
absurd, concept -that brings 
Einstein - or as he's called 
here, The Scientist - into 
contact with the other three 
larger-than-life characters in 
his hotel room on one fateful 
night in 1954. Terry 
johnson's mostly engaging, 
thoughtful screenplay is quite 
stagy -- Insignificance was 
originally a stage play - but 
the film is sparked by Roeg's 
customary cinematic explo-
sions (mostly confined to 
flashbacks) and the high 
quality of the acting. 

At its most charming, 
Insignificance features Monroe 
- er, The Actress (played by 
Theresa Russell) - explain-
ing the Theory of Relativity 
(Specific only) to a skeptical 
Einstein (Michael Emil) using 
flashlights and toy trains and 
cars. Russell makenhe best of 
an impossible role --
Monroe's image has been too 
over-exposed to allow for 
much lattitude in character 
interpretation - as she plays 
off of Emil's surprisingly 
effective portrayal of Einstein 
as a sort of stock-characterish 
Lovable Old Jewish Wise 
Guy. . 

Tony Curtis, in a bizarre bit 
of casting, does alright as the 
kinky Senator, but the 
character is laden with far too 
much portent. Perhaps hestof 
all is the ever-expanding Gary 
Busey, who plays slugger 
DiMageio as a sensitive 
lunkhead.

Want to plan ahead for 

good times but don't want to 
commit to one night or 
another when your studying 
might get in the way? Or 
maybe you might want to cut 
out from the books and see 
something really rad. 

The UCSD Drama Depart-
ment has an offer you can't 
refuse. Students of the 
university can buy special 
booklets of Ave coupons for a 
total cost of$15, good for any 
seat available in the house at 
the time you present your 
coupon to the theatre box 
office. That's a sweet price of 
only $3 per seat, for the thrill 
of live theatre, produced by 
what may be the best theatre 
training school in our United 
States. (Move over Yale and 
Julliard, UCSD is your peer!) 

The only limit to the 
number of booklets you can 
buy is four at one time, and 
there is no limit to the number 
of guests you can take to the 
theatre at this discount price. 
(Compare this to a normal 
sea t price of $5 -$9). 
Interested? Well, don't stop 
reading yet, there is even 
more. If you are a first-year 
graduate student, a freshman/ 
woman, or a first-year transfer 
student, you are eligible for an 
even more astounding deal: 
10 coupons for the 
unbelievable price of $10. 
That's only one smaclcer per 
seat, to get you into drama 
staged by Tony-award-
winning artists, as well as the 
recipients of numerous San 
Diego and Los Angeles 
awards. 

"Theatre in this country is 
going through a great 
metamorphisis, and we're on 
the leading edge of it," says 
Lori Carlson of the Drama 
Department 's production

office, which is orchestrating 
the phenomenal five#for-$15 
or 10-for-$10 deal. 

Drama chairman Richard 
Riddell (one of those Tony'S) 
announced this season with 
the remark, "I expect us to 
concern ourselves with 
wonder, with discovery, with 
exploring." Now is your 
chance, ua'UCSDstudent, to 
get in on the ground floor (or 
seat) of this year's mission of 
exploration, to join Riddell 
and the Drama Department as 
they seek out "new theatre, 
new vantages on old theatre . . 
. (and) exciting · and 
worthwhile theatre." All for 
only three bucks per trek (or 
one, if you're a new crew-
member onboard the 
university /Enterprise). 

What's the gimmick, you 
say? Surely they can't do it -
any seat, any night, for only 
$3 (or $1 [I!])? Well, believe 
it or don'tj it's true. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: The 
1 O-for-$l 0 deal expires 
tomorrow, hut the five-for-
$15 will continue throughout 
the year. All you need to do to 
pick up your coupon book( s), 
as many as four at once, is to 
seek out the drama 
productions table on Revelle 
Plaza, today or tomorrow 
U :30-1 :30, or visit the drama 
productions office, upstairs in 
the Humanities/Cluster / 
Mandella Library, room 

_3451, or drop by the theatre 
box office in the evenings. 

Buy your coupons now, see 
the plays whenever you feel 
like it, and bring any of your 
friends. All that's required is 
to present the coupons at the 
theatre box office with your 
student ID (your ID will be 
good for non-student friends' 
seats, too, so bring them -

you dare, or if you want to

Maybe you've seen the 
banners hanging around 
campus, "Five Plays for $15," 
or maybe you've heard about 
the stellar lineup of shows, 

'The Bird' Parker," the jazz 
artist. 

And that's only what's on 
line for fall! At least five other 
works are scheduled for 
winter and spring, including: a 
visit by New York's acclaimed

By this Friday, nearly 
50,000 people will have 
passed through the gates of 
Humphrey's to hear jazz 
played by the top performers 
in the industry today. It is 
hard to believe, but San Diego 
is one of the largest jazz 
markets in the entire United 
States. It is ironic that, in a city 
like San Diego, where there is 
no hardcore dedication to any 
of the arts, a medium as 
progresssive as jazz can gain 
such a strong foothold. 

There was a total of 45 
shows in tht.teaSOn that began 
early lalt June and ends this 
coming Friday with a 
performance by the Los 
Angeles group Hiroshima. 
The roster of artists that 
played at Humphrey's this 
summer is as long as it is 
impressive. ChUck Mangione, 
Larry Carlton, Lee Ritenour, 
Ramsey Lewis, Randy 
Newman, Stanley Jordan and 
many, many more all 
performed for enthusiastic 
crowds at the outdoor facility 
on Shelter Island. 

The success of Humphrey's

elements: the bookings for the 
series and the concert facility 
itself. An atmosphere is 
created by the concert area set 
against the bay that is more 
like a small club than an 
imposing theater. The venue 
is small- it holds a maximum 
of 600 people -- but this size 
allows more artist-audience 
interaction and creates a more 
intimate setting for the 
concert. The management of 
the facility was very good in 
that it went unnoticed. MBC, 
another local concert firm, 
attempted to produce a 
Humph. y's-like series at 

various sites throughout the 
city but was doomed from the 
beginning due to a poor 
management and inconsid-
erate treatment of concert-
goers. 

Hiroshima's performance 
should prove to be a grand 
finale for the season at 
Humphrey's. There is a very 
real magic in the group's blend 
of traditional Japanese music 
with western jazz fusion. They 
will play Friday at 7 and 9 pm.

Continued from page 1 

Certain patrons will be 
attracted to the show because 
they know Carmen Zapata is 
an actress with great stage 
presence. They will be 
delighted to know that Zapata 
enjoys San Diego audiences, 
and says she doesn't find 
making her role afresh 
difficult. "I am very close to 
the role," she stated, "The 
character is the archetype of 
all moms - the folklorical 
MocheT Courage. 

"Lorca was an observer of 
his culture," says UCSD 
Drama Professor Jorge 
Huerta, "He was a docu-
menter in poetry of the 
passions of these people." 
What makes Blood Wedding 
unique, in Huerta's opinion, 
is the writer's imagery that 
comes through in the Spanish 
version. 

Hopefully, through the 
revised versions English 
audiences will come to 
appreciate why Lorca 
continues to be the most 
popular playwright of the 
20th century in Spain and 

Carmen Zapata , the driving force 
behind SWnda"5 'BIood Wedding' 

South America. The LA 
Weekl, writes, Blood Wedding 
is as wet with blood as 
Macbeth; its lovers are as star-
crossed as RomtO and Juliet, as 
identified in their own souls 
with nature as Anthon, and 
Cleopatra. " 

Art of Noile: "Eddie 
Murphy to be in Star Trek 
1 V?" The four-letter 
comedian has been con-
sidered for a role in the 
upcoming motion picture 
from Paramount. Leonard 
Nimoy, who played Mr. 
Spock in the series and is 
director of the new film, was 
interviewed in Star log 
magazine issue No. 100. 
"(Murphy) is a big Star Trek 
fan," said Nimoy, "The. press 
k'nows he has a multi-picture 
deal with Paramount. They're 
putting two and two together 
prematurely." 

Nevertheless, Nimoy and 
associates said that Murphy 
might cross paths with the 
Enterprise crew when Kirk 
and his pals journey back to 
the 1990s. "We have 
discussed time travel," Nimoy 
reveals, "We've talked about 
going back to the American 
West in the 19th century, or 
even back to the dinosaur 
age."

writer-guitarist Ian McNabb 
sings with conviction. His 
vocals achieve new levels of

noticeably on "Perambu-

styles - alternately gruff and 
melodic - are n ice ly

Icicle W orks 
~ Small Price of a Bic)cle 
8caPn Banquet import 

The curious song titles 
alone are sure to make anyone 
want to listen to Icicle Works' 
secood album. The album 
name imelf is a peculiar thing 
- it's pulled from the Line 
.. the small price of a bicycle 
&so' t mine" from " AU My 
Dauahters" - and combines 
with such titles as "Hollow 
Horse," "Conscience of 
let." and "Saint's Sojourn" 
to indicate what to expect 

from the lyrics: lofty thought 
and impassioned feeling 
expressed in imaginative 
languaRe· 

The Small Pnce of a Bic,::1e 
replaces the idealism 
everpresent in [dele Works' 
eponymous first album with a 

ti~ of cynicism: "l sing this 
song with my tongue in my 
cheek for the jilted, the 
jauQdiced, the angry young 
men who somehow believe 
that the status quo chanan 
with juvenile slopns in 

The lcicles have de .. ~ 
a style that is uniquely daeir 
own, a powerful lOund that 
allows their SOOIS tID be 
diverse and e:rcitinc. They 
boldly a~rt t:herMeIYes with 
the sheer streDKth of the 
drumming (bV Chris 
Sharrock), bass{Olris layhe ) 
and guitar (McNabb) work , 
whether in the lively "Hollow 
Hone" or soothing Of A. 
sumed Sundown." 

Thev really whoop it up in 
" W indfaU." The loud, janelv 
(Cuitar and searing beat 
produce a whirlwind of .alOng 
- no subdety here. The piano 
playing of Jacques LouuicT 
adds to the beauty of 
"R.plds, " as his atpeIIIio& 
create the wondrous effect of 
."the:.: rapids we're rolling 
on'" " Book of Reaton" and 
"Pen mbula tor " offe r a 
harder, fiery sound. 

'The touching ' 'Con8cience 
of Kinp" has an indefinable 
power to stir emotions. (t nLls 
the conscience . nd takes hold, 
not to let go. The dramatic 
creacendo at the end of this 
song is an appropriate d oaing 
for a sparkling album with a 
very hot sound, indeed.
