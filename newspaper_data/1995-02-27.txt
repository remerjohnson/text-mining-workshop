Affirmative Action 
SACRAMENTO - Gov .. Pete 
Wilson endorsed the ballot 
initiative which would ban 
affirmative-action programs 
last Saturday, calling it a 
"fundamental message about 
fairness." Addressing the 
2,000 delegates and guests at 
the California Republican 
Party convention,Wilson said 
he would begin the process of 
dismantling affirmative-action 
requirements by issuing an 
executive order against racial 
and gender preferences which 
are within the governor's 
authority. He called the 
California Civil Rights 
Initiative, which is likely to 
appear on either the March or 
November 1996 ballot, a 
national political statement at 
least as important as Proposi-
tion 187. 

Administrators 
Indicted for Fraud 
LOS ANGELES - Two 
former UCLA administrators 
were indicted last Wednesday 
on a charge of embezzling 
more than $600,000 through 
false billings to two phony 
employment agencies. A 
federal grand jury indicted the 
Department of Radiology 's 
former administrative officer, 
James G. Campbell and former 
chief financial officer, Benny 
Chow, on 59 counts; including 
conspiracy, fraud and money 
laundering. If convicted on all 
charges, Campbell faces a 
maximum sentence of 635 
years in prison and a fine of 
$20 million. Chow faces a 
maximum sentcnce of 165 
years in prison and a fine of 
$8.25 million. 

Rally Condemns 
Racist Hate Mall 
BERKELEY - Hundreds of 
UC Berkeley law students and 
faculty held a rally recently 
condemning the continuing 
onslaught of racist letters sent 
to mi'J1Ority students at the 
School of Law. Approximately 
35 students have received hate 
mail with such statements as, 
"When I see you in class it 
bugs the hell out of me 
because your [sic] taking the 
seat of someone qualified," 
and "You belong at Coolie 
High Law, don't you forge!. " 
Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien 
said he will seek the "strongest 
possible sanctions."

Just beyond the northeast comer of campus, a faulty wheel on a railway car begins to vibrate. The car sways violently and then topples onto the 
ground as the freight train derails and 
crashes with a deafening noise. Three tanker

The controversy over the univers ity 'S liability 
for the Radically Inclined Ski Club (RISC) All-Cal 
ski trip was resolved last Tuesday, with the admin-
istration adopting a strictly hands-off policy. 

A meeting between administrators and RISC 
members settled the controversy which erupted 
after a Guardian features article recounted stories 
of "beer guzzling" and heavy partying during this 
year's All-Cal trip. 

The article aroused the administration's con-
cern over its liability for possibly dangerous or 
illegal activit ies that could take place during the 
trip. 

After looking into the liability issue, adminis-
trators have decided to completely divorce itself 
from the club-sponsored trip. 

"Our concern now, is to make sure that the 
public knows that not all of the student activities 
are endorsed by the university," said Director of 
Special Services Nick Aguilar . 

The RISC club has agreed to add an extra 
sentence to the All-Cal tickets which will make it 
clear the trip is independent of the university. 

In addition, the release forms which students 
sign will have an added paragraph which restates 
the university is not in any way connected with the 
All-Cal. 

When asked if this will change the way the 
students will run such trips, RISC Advisor Scott 
Berndes said, "What students? What trip? The 
university has nothing to do with that at all." 

"The club itself will be liable for anything that 
happens," Berndes said. "We, as an administration, 
are disassociating ourselves completely from this 
trip." 

Aguilar said the administration simply wishes 
to clarify its already-existing policy toward off-
campus club activities. Like the co-ops, RISC must 
make it clear to outside contractors that it is not 
acting as agents of the university, according to 
Aguilar.

Fusion Reactor Project's Funding May Soon Be in Jeopardy 
RESEARCH: 
Scientists fear federal 
budget cuts 
By Ivan Delventhal 
Senior Staff Writer 

Inside a donut-shaped fusion re-
actor approximately nine-stories tall, 
magnetic forces compress atoms 
while they are heated to hundreds of 
millions of degrees and fuse, releas-
ing energy. The process is known as 
magnetic fusion and scientists, in-
cluding UCSD Professor Marshall 
Rosenbluth, at the International 
Thermonuclear Experimental Reac-

to~ (ITER) program in La Jolla are 

calling it "The energy resource of 
the 21st century." 

However, research into this new 
form of clean energy may be jeopar-
dized in coming years due to inad-
equate federal support. 

The ITER program is currently 
in the middle of a six-year, $1.2 
billion project aimed at drawing a 
blueprint for a fusion reactor which 
could serve as a model for future 
plants. 

Although funding for the design 
of the fusion reactor is expected to 
continue into 1998, project scien-
tists fear a budget shortfall may pre-
vent them from building the ITER

Las Madres at UCSD 
PROTEST: Argentinian organization gives 
presentation on human-rights violations 
By Ben ElCln 
Senior Staff Writer 

Donning white handkerchiefs

Argentinean human-rights organi-
zation, gave a presentation at UCSD 
last Saturday.

The documentary also covered

vocal members of the group would 

denounce soldiers 
guarding the Presi-

"cowards."

"I think people in [the United

Las Madres has declined gov-

" We won' t forget and we won't

Over the years, Las Madres has 
grown in numbers, as well as the 
range of causes it supports. While it 
continues to campaign against mili-
tary abusein Argentina, Las Madres 
has also targeted labor and social

Nobel Laureate to Lectur. on 
Genetic Fabrication 

Nobel laureate Manfred Eigen. director of the Max 
Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry. will deliver 
a lecture on the origins of genetiC information on 
Tues .â¢ Feb. 28. atÂ·4 p.m. at UCSD's Robinson Building 
Complex Auditorium. 

'How to Generate Genetic Information" is the first 
Hans E. Suess Memorial Lecture in a series dedicated 
to the late UCSD chemistry professor and renowned 
researcher who died inÂ· 1993. 

Eigen won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1967 for 
his research on rapid chemical reactions. In recent 
years. his interests have focused on explaining the 

process of self-organization. which could lead to a 
better understanding of the origin of biological infor-
mation. Eigen will discuss results and examples of a 
theory, based on non-linear dynamics. which show 
parallels between the organization of genetiC informa-
tion and the organization of human thought.

PINION 
HEALING EDUCATION 

THESYSTE 
IN DEFENSE 
OF ELITISM 

By Peter Chang 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

When the twentysomething clerk rang up my order on a recent shopping trip, he calculated sales taxes by in-putting each price into a $30 scien-
tific calculator, punching in 100, then "times," then 
seven, then "percent," then paused to remember the 
original price, then added that 100 to the price. 
This would not have been as painful an experi-
ence, were it not for the fact that a large num-
ber of goods needed to be purchased, and each 
price was being computed in this fashion and 
added to the next. 

This struggle with the calculator was more 
than I could bear, and I finally broke down 
and offered a suggestion: Wouldn 't it be easier 
to simply add the prices together and then 
multiply the sum by 1.07? Of course, bcing 
an accreditcd graduate of the American 
school system, he didn't believe me. After 
several abortive attempts to sum my total, 
he arrived at the final amount - at which I 
had already arrived on pen and paper. 

"Wow," he said. "Does that trick work 
for all numbers?" 

I was sorely tempted with several responses: 
No, it only works on totals of more than $400 

worth of goods bought by Asians. 
Yes, but you must chant the Math Mantra out 

loud as you calculate, to make it work. 
Yes, but you must believe it will work, or it will 

fail. Think only positive thoughts and the answer 
will be revealed to you, Grasshopper. 

Instead, I nodded. 
"Cool, thanks!" he said, wrapping my purchases. 

Before I left the store, I casually asked where he 
went to school. " UCSD, man!" he answered. 

The problem in our educational system rests 
largely on a shift of educational leaders 20 years 
ago, when aging hippies and flower children com-
mandeered the helm of our schools - turning them 
into day-care centers for teenagers, instead of a 
training ground for competent adults. Perhaps the 
solution to our educational woes lies in observing 
the successes of other nations. 

According to the Washington Post, Japanese 
education has a proliferation of jukus, or "cram

compliment to the "normal" day school which Japa-
nese students attend . Kunio Kijima, director of 
Nihon Kyoiku Gakuin, a prestigious juku in To-
kyo, observed: "Regular school tends to bore the 
smartest students. What we do here is push them to 
achieve their potential." 

Push, indeed. Eleven-year-old students spend 
evenings at jukus learning to answer questions such 
as:

36 of the students wear glasses and 1/48 of the stu-
dents who wear glasses are girls. What is the ratio 
of boys with glasses to the total number of students?

CULTIVAnNG FREE THOUGHT 
By Francisco DeVries, Senior Staff Writer 

I t seems every educational critic in the United States eagerly points across the Pacific when describing the woeful state of 
education in America. The comparison 
these critics make to Japanese schools is 
a damning one. 

Schools in Japan are orderly, neat and 
effective. With the world's most Iilerate 
population, and a school system which 
routinely produces some of the most pro-
ductive and well-educated workers on the 
planet, iI is all obvious choice to serve as 
a model for U.S. educational reform. 

Why, then, are an increasing number 
of Japanese educators, businessmen and 
students calling for a major overhaul of a 
system which is so admired around the 

world? 
"We need an educational system that 

encourages individuality," said Sumitomo 
Trust & Banking Co. Director Osamu 
Sakrai, in Forbes magazine. "Education 
reform is absolutely essential," he added. 

American schools, for all their well-
documented faults, teach something 
which may be just as important as alge-
bra and spelling: They teach kids how to 
think for themselves. Critical thinking, 
debate and discussion, prominent in the 
curriculum of U.S. schools, are almost 
nonexistent in Japanese schools. Japanese 
students attend school six days per week 
and are loaded with an impressive amount 
of school work. However, writes the 
Economist, "students spend their lessons 

taking notes rather than debating." 
It is this rigid focus on storing knowl-

edge, rather than learning how to use it, 
which has many Japanese calling for re-
form. It is the failure of the Japanese edu-
cation system to inslill the importance of 
creativity and individuality in its students 
which leaves Japan "at a big disadvan-
tage to the U.S.," according to Forbes 
magazine. 

Unfortunately, the ability to debate an 
issue is not measured by SAT scores or 
international math competitions of the 
type which Americans lose with an al-
most-religious fervor. 

The ability to use critical thinking may 
be hard to measure statistically; however,

GINGRICH IGNORES EFFECfS OF WATER POLLUTION 
Editor: 

I am responding to Derek van 
Hoften's praise of Newt Gingrich's 
efforts to "relieve" San Diego of the 
"burden" of treating its sewage 
(" Attitude Overshadows Positive 
Efforts," Feb. 21). 

Curr.endy, San Diego's method 
of dealing with sewage is to pump 
it, untreated, out of a several-mile-
long pipe into the. Pacific Ocean. As 
a result, San Diego has one of the 
highest rates of beach closures in the 
United States, due to the pathogenic 
bacteria from raw sewage, which is 
often found in the water. 

In addition, the sewage pumped 
into the ocean acts as a huge injec-
tion of nitrogenous waste into the 
coastal ecosystem. This ecosystem, 
consisting primarily of kelp forests, 
is knocked completely out of equi-
librium by this pollution and is 
eventually destroyed. According to 
Gingrich's all-knowing "scientists," 
this is good for the environment. 

The Clean Water Act not only 
protects the ocean, iI protects drink-
ing water. Each year, over 900,000 
Americans get sick, and almost 
1000 die, from drinking tap water. 
This indicates that drinking-water 
standards should be improved, not 

downgraded. Gingrich wants stan-
dards relaxed because it is cheaper 
for polluters to dump chemicals into 
aquifers than make them clean up 
their by-products. 

Most of the programs which van 
Hoften endorses, when carefully 
analyzed, yield similar conclusions: 
Gingrich cares only about corporate 
profits and corporate rights.

JeDnlrer Poumelle 
'Shock Jock' Is 
Talented and WItty 
Editor: 

As a Howard Stem fan, I have 
mixed feelings about Jeff Niesel's 
article ("Howard Stern Hits Air-
waves," Feb. 16). First, let me say 
that Stern is intelligent and ex-
tremely talented. I've listened to him 
for four years, and each day he 
brightens my morning. He's got 
amazingly quick wit and, as Niesel 

seems to begrudgingly acknowl-
edge, is brutally honest. 

Stern's honesty is refreshing in 
a society which is afraid to say 
something that might - oh no! -
offend someone. Niesel's article 
sadly had all the components of the 
traditional article about Stern. It 
contains the anti-Stern adjectives 
("raunchy," "obnoxious" and "loud-
mouthed") and gross inaccuracies 
(i.e. that Stern makes fun of lesbi-
ans - the fact is, he loves them 
more than life itself). 

Why is Stem "loud-mouthed"? 
Is it because he isn't afraid to say 
what's on his mind? For Nieselto 
call Stem "loud-mouthed" while at 
the same time admiring his honesty 
seems a bit contradictory. Perhaps 
Niesel bashes Stern because this is 
what people have come to expect 
from an article about Stern. After all, 
he's a bad person, right? Oh no, he 
talks about sex. Gee, that's going to 
ruin the country. He talks about im-
migration. That's a big no-no for 
some reason. Come on, lighten up, 
people. Stern is on the radio for one 
purpose: to make people laugh. If 
Stern doesn 't make you laugh, well, 
that's why radios have dials.

What is the ratio of girls who do not 
wear glasses? If the total number of 
students is 720, how many boys are 
there? 

â¢ A container is comprised of a 
five-centimeter cube, and two up-
right parallelpipeds measuring 5 x 
10 x 10 and 5 x 15 x 15 centime-
ters. What is the capacity of this 
container? What is the depth of wa-
ter if you pour in one liter? 

In another room, eight children, 
each of whom are about three years old, 
sit politely in little chairs as the teacher 
holds up pictures of objects, calling on 
students to identify them. These three-
year-olds get to go home early - the 
jukus forthe 11- to 14-year-olds don't 
end until midnight, when the students 
go home to prepare for 6:30 a.m. 
classes the following moming. 

In Tokyo, the Yano Research In-
stitute reports that 4.4 million Japa-
nese students are enrolled in 50,000 
jukus around the nation. This rep-
resents 18 percent of elementary 
students and a whopping 52.2 per-
cent of seventh- through ninth-grad-
ers. The best and brightest students 
compete fiercely for coveted spots 
in the best junior and senior high 
schools. In the process, Japan boasts 
a nearly nonexistent illiteracy rate, 
a technical competence which 
eclipses other industrialized nations, 
a workforce which can rapidly adapt 
to an information-driven economy. 

The success of Japanese educa-
tion rests on the notion that it is, un-
like our system, unapologetically 
el itisl. Slots in the best schools are 
not parceled out according to race 
and ethnicity, but rather according to

merit. The Japanese system demands, 
and receives, much from its youth. 
Schools are seen as a means to an 
end: the preparation of individuals to 
survive in a technologically sophis-
ticated society, where the language 
of power is spoken through calculus, 
computers and the natural sciences. 

Contrast this with another Wash-
illgtoll Post article, describing 
Montgomery County's Bethesda-
Chevy Chase High School - con-
sidered by many to be one of best 
schools in the United States. A poll 
of 1,000 of its students, out of I ,600, 
revealed that 25 percent thought 
school was "a waste of time." Forty 
percent acknowledged they were 
working below their potential and 
only 15 percent worried they would 
not get into a college of their choice.

school, it is not unusual to see teach-
ers allow students to do homework 
in class, theorizing it is the only 
place where it would get done. 
Quizzes and exams are canceled on 
a regular basis, because students 
have not done the required readings. 
School is seen as a game to be 
played, instead of an opportunity to 
expand one's depth of knowledge 
and to challenge the student to think. 

In lesser schools, suggestions 
abound on the abolishment of home-
work and the reduction of already-ri-
diculously low graduation standards. 
According to The San Diego Union-
Tribune, administrators ofthe San Di-
ego City School District toyed with 
the idea of eliminating the "F" grade 
to avoid "traumatizing" students' 
fragile egos. That these ideas are given 
serious consideration (and sometimes 
implementation) is a telling wake-up 
call to parents in this country. 

Is there hope? If we have learned 
anything, it is that the United States 
is in a position to exhume itself from 
this shallow grave we've dug for 
ourselves. For example, high school 
teaoller Jaime Escalante, whose story 
was told in the film Stand and De-
liver, offered a new paradigm. Un-
like his colleagues in the inner-city 
high school, he refused to write off 
his students as dropouts. He threw 
his students a formidable gauntlet -
the AP Calculus test - and chal-
lenged them to pass it. They all did . 

That an entire class of inner-dty 
youths can muster the courage to con-
querthis subject speaks volumes on the 
flexibility of the human mind. So, there 
is hope. Let us all challenge younger 
siblings and relatives to achieve. In a 
technological society, their success-
and ours - depends on it. 

THINKERS: 
ContInued from pale 4 
this does not mean it is not tan-
gible. When Ronald Reagan's 
Education Secretary William 
Bennett showed up at a small 
Missouri school one November 
morning, he decided to take the 
helm, and taught a class of third-
and fourth-graders. As The New 
York Times reported, "The sec-
retary of education learned that 
none of the pupils were tongue 
tied." The students turned the 
class around and quizzed 
Bennett. In the United States, this 
kind of debate, without deference 
to authority, is a sign of success. 

In Japan, a graduate of Tokyo 
University was reminiscing 
about his college career. Speak-
ing with a Canadian professor 
who had taught one of his 
classes, the student said, "I can 
still remember the first time you 
asked me a question." 

This student had made it to 
one of Japan's most prestigious 
universities and was blown away 
when a professor actually asked 
for his input. 

Falling SAT scores, outra-
geously high drop-out rates and 
all the other bleak indicators of 
the U.S. educational system's 
decline have brought much atten-
tion to its sorry state. But in the 
rush to "do something" about this 
educational crisis, we need to be 
careful about what we wish for. 

Japanese schools place enor-
mous emphasis on rigorous exams 
which alone determine whether a 
student will be placed on the elite 
college-bound track. The tests are

exclusively multiple-choice and in-
volve little critical thinking. Many 
Americans are in favor of this stan-
dardized testing as a method to rank 
schools and students, and a way to 
refocus education on the "three Rs" 
- reading, writing and arithmetic. 

But such uniformity can come at 
a high cost. We want higher literacy 
rates, fewer dropouts and students 
who can do basic math, but not at the 
expense of eliminating all curriculum 
except that which would make good 
standardized-test material. 

Instead, we should work to im-
. prove our performance on basic skills 

within the current framework, which 
the Japanese are eyeing enviously. 
Students must be continuously chal-
lenged to understand the t~eory be-
hind the fact. Student opinion should 
be valued and sought after, not stifled 
under the burden of endless math 
problems and longer school days. 

The solution to America's edu-
cational crisis is not simple. But it 
rests on creating an environment in 
which students want 10 learn. Force-
feeding them information will not 
propel them to achieve higher test 
scores; it will instead lead to the sti-
fling system with which Japanese 
educators are now grappling. 

Nobel Prize-winning physicist 
Reona Esaki, who now heads 
Tsukuba University after 32 years in 
the United States working for IBM, 
understands this problem well . "Edu-
cation should be invigorating and 
fun, but in Japan, it isn't," he said. 

America needs studerots who 
have learned to formulate their own 
thoughts, not students who, like ro-
bots, are only able to regurgitate 
formulas which have been 
"crammed" into their brains.

Yalladolid added, however, that

little liability." 

He recommended that studentÂ·

According to Baker, "The total 

amount that the United States spends 
on energy research and develop-
ment is woefully inadequate given 
the vital importanceofthe subject to 
our long term well-being." 

In the magnetic fusion process, 
two hydrogen isotopes, deuterium 
and tritium, are "banged together" 
at very high velocities to create he-
lium, a heavier atom. The fusion of 
the two light atoms into a heavier 
atom results in the release of excess 
energy. 

As energy demands are projected 
to increase five-fold by 2050, ITER 
scientists believe that alternatives 
to fossil fuels must be explored and

How IT WORKS 
Fusion works by colliding 
atoms of two isotopes, which 
combine and release energy. 
In the reaction shown below, 
deuterium and tritium collide 
to form helium, with a total 
energy release of 17.6 million 
electron volts.

Police and fire crews arrive on 
the scene immediately after the ac-
cident but are unable to identify the 
chemical before being driven back 
by the toxic fumes. 

Unaware of the fast-moving 
cloud, students chase papers blown

It is Wilson's job to spring a 
good disaster on people. As the per-
son responsible for preparing the 
campus for a whole range of catas-
trophes - from lab accidents to 
sniper attacks to riots - Wilson 
knows practice is the name of the 
game. 

He also wrote the UCSD Emer-

The plan, as a result, has been 
specifically structured to provide 
organization in the first few hours 
following a disaster. "After those 
initial hours, then people tend to 
settle down," Wilson said. 

Wilson's plan divides the cam-
pus into 13 self-contained zones, 
each with its own coordinators and 
bins full of emergency equipment. 
The zones separate the campus into 
smaller and more manageable 
groups, each with supplies tailored 
to the area-'s particular needs.

"That way," Wilson said, "we 
can have everything sprinkled all 
over campus. " 

But Wilson's efforts are only a 
small part of a comprehensive sys-
tem of disaster preparedness and 
safety programs at UCSD. In an 
emergency, hundredsof people who 
normally have noth ing to do with 

dents lounging on the lawn begin 
gasping for breath as the almost-
invisible cloud reaches them. People 
begi n to panic. 

Aconfe rence room in the middle 
of campus is silent. A group of cam-
pus administrators have gathered to 
grapple with this horrifying disas-
ter. The sit uation is detailed on a 
giant wipeboard, and a large map 
showi ng evacuatio n routes has been 
hastily tacked to the wall. The som-
ber group stares at the times, loca-
tions and other specifics of the crash 
- they know they must act quickly. 

The group is finally told by the 
San Diego Police that the chemical 
is chlorine gas - an extremely dan-
geroussubstancethat is fatal in large 
doses. 

Director of Physical Plant Ser-
vices Jack Hug decides to shut down 
all campus ventilation systems. Phy-
sicians at Student Health Services 
and nearby hospitals are put on alert. 
The police and other safety person-
nel start to evacuate large areas of 
campus. 

Environmental , Health and 
Safety Specialist Scott Wilson 
watches the administrators desper-
ately try to manage a disaster that 
seems straight out of their worst 
nightmares. 

Wilson knows everything there 
is to know about the tanker acci-

ness. 
Wilson 's scenarios, always un-

announced, are designed to prepare 
decision-makers to deal wi th the 
unexpected. 

"You have to make decisio ns just 
like it was real ," said Health and 
Safety Director Marty MacDougall, 
a regul ar attcndee at Wilson's im-
promptu dri lls. " It could be life or 
death , and the decisions we make 
affect others." 

Sitting in that tense conference 
room, there are no right and wrong 
answers, according to Wilson, only 

each other will have to work to-
gether and coordi nate their efforts. 
Rattled 

With over 25 faults runn ing 
through the San Diego area, earth-
quakes are the most obvious disas-
ter concern at UCSD. 

UCSD sitsononeofSan Diego's 
biggest fault lines. Almost 35 miles 
in length, the Rose Canyon fault 
runs along La Jolla Shores beach, up 

beller ways of being 
prepared. That is the 
purpose behind the 
UCSD Emergency 
Management Plan. 

After a major di-
saster, the plan is the 
blueprint for all emer-
gency service coordi-
nation at UCSD. With 
30,000 students, em-
ployees and visitors 
on campus every day, 
maintaining order and 
calm after a disaster is 
the key.

be able to

ting buildings- are 
by far the best way to prepare for a 
major earthquake. 

When Muir College Assistant 
Resident Dean Blue Robbins came 
to UCSD \0 years ago, there was no 

emergency plan, no drills, not even 
a manual to follow in case of an 
earthquake. Robbins eventually con-
vinced the administration ofthe need 
to contribute resources to prepare 
for an inevitable disaster. 

Within the year, Muir College 
was running evacuation drills. 

Now, all five colleges sound 
emergency alarms early on a Fall 
Quarter morning, and thousands of 
students pour out of the dorms and 
apartments to a designated safe area 
nearby. 

"The idea," Robbins said, "is that 
in a stupor at three in the morning, 
we're hoping people will at least 
say, 'Oh, we ' re supposed to go to 
this place.' And [students) just 
knowing where to go is a success on 
our part ." 

Being driven from bed by si rens, 
fl ashing lights and resident advisors 
barking into bullhorns at 7:00 in the 
morn ing is not popular with stu-
dents, but according to Robbins, 
mo t seem to recognize the neces-
sity of such drills. 

"People are so much more pre-
pared than they used to be. They 've 
experienced or know someone 
who 's experienced a huge earth-
quake or fire or flooding in the past 
10 years and because of that, they're 
a lot more ... compliant because it 
hits home for them personally," 
Robbins said. 

Returning to a theme champi-
oned by Wilson, Robbins said Muir 
College disaster planning focuses 
on handling the period directly after 
a disaster. The drills, he said, are 
designed to create "organized chaos, 
instead of just chaos."

Most people think of Student 
Health Services as the place to go 
when you get bronchitis or have 
sprained ankle. But following a di-
saster, Student Health is much more 
than merely a purveyor of antibiot-

your life.

State of 
Emergency 

UCSD's Emergency Manage-
ment Plan designates three lev-
els of campus emergencies. 

Level 
A small-scale, localized prob-

lem contained to a single space 
such as laboratory, loading dock, 
etc. Level One emergencies inÂ· 
volve small chemical spills, power 
outages and other typical prob-
lems encountered in day-to-day 
operations. Disaster response 
proceedures outlined in the UCSD 
Disaster Management Plan would 
not be activated for a Level One 
event. 

An emergency that is larger in 
scope and s ize than Level One. It 
is a more serious event that in-
volves, for instance, the entire 
floor of a building. it may involve 
a large-scale evacuation and re-
quire assistance from off-cam-
pus emergency resources. All or 
part of the Disaster Management 
Plan woutd be activated. 

Levell 
A campus-wide disastrous 

event, such as a strong earth-
quake, that causes widespread 
damage and injuries which over-
whelm available emergency re-
sources and personnet. Such di-
sasters pose a major threat to 
life and property. Outside emer-
gency resources from both the 
govemmental and private sector 
would be used, In addition to full 
activation of all Disaster Man-
agement Plan procedures.

DISASTER: 
Earthquakes top list 
of concerns 
Continued from paee 9 
a frequent participant in Wilson 's 
emergency drills, said the Student 
Health staff would be capable of 
handling a major disaster. 

"It's medical stuff, we do it ev-
eryday," Popesaid. "A lot of people 
here are from big hospitals and 
handle stressful situations really 
well. That's part of being in medi-
cine and I think it'll snap together 
[in an emergency) ." 

The doctors, nurses and special-
ists who work at Student Health 
operate under the "Triage Plan." 
Developed by Student Health Di-
rector Brian Murray, theTriagePlan 
directs medical services after a di-
saster. 

It divides arriving patients into 
different categories depending on 
the severity of their injuries. Life-
threatening injuries would be treated 
immediately. Less serious injuries, 
a broken leg for instance, would be 
treated as second priority. The Triage 
Plan even designates the rehabilita-
tion room as the place to keep people 
who are dead on arrival or mortally 
wounded. 

In a truly catastrophic emer-
gency, Wilson said the North Rec-
reation Field and RIMACcould also 
be used for mass medical care. 

But Student Health does have 
serious limitations. 

"We're not a hospital. We can ' t 
do surgery, we have no intensive 
care. What we can do is stabilize, 
like the paramedics. All the first aid 
stuff we can handle, but the real 

The UCSD Guardian FEATURES 9 

serious stuff we might have to send 
off," Pope said. 

The clinic is also constrained by 
limited hours. "During working 
hours, 1 think we 'd have an excel-
lent response," Murray said. "But at 
night time, my biggest concern is 
how fast the staff can get back onto 
campus." 

Palmer said. 
There are scores of small acci-

dents that illustrate Palmer'S point. SAN DIEGO AI FaULT 
Several years ago, a student 

working at a Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography laboratory acciden-
tally spilled ether on herself and 
then caught fire. While she was 
burned, the student did not panic 
and was able to put the fire out fairly 
quickly . She believes the safety lec-
ture helped her cope with the situa-
tion calmly and limit her injuries. 

More than twenty-five faults have been identified running 
through the San Diego area. Some of the major ones are 
shown below. 

If a disaster occurs after .hours, 
all doctors and nurses would be 
called back to work . Student Health 
staffers have special identification 
to allow them through police lines. 
P.y Attention 

Not every emergency is as spec-
tacular as an earthquake or over-
turned tanker car. With hundreds of 
research laboratories located at 
UCSD, chemical spills, fires and 
explosions are a constant concern 
for emergency plar.ners. 

According to Health and Safety 
chemical specialist John Palmer, 
prevention and common sense is the 
key . UCSD requires a one-hour 
safety lecture before any student is 
allowed to work in a lab. 

"Th is is a case where [the safety 
course] takes effect," Palmer said. 
"She was okay ... because she paid 
enough attention [in the class)." 
A ClltMtrophe Will...., ..... 

Wilson, who has been working 
on the disaster plan for the last four 
years, has made simplicity the goal. 

"The old plan was huge. It turned 
people off too much. What we've 
done is reduce the emergency plan 
from about a three-inch-thick binder 
to about 12 pages," he said. 

San 
Diego 

Students who have endured the 
safety lecture often complain that it 
is boring and unnecessary. 

"I don ' t remember that much of 
it. It's just common sense stuff," 
said one student. 

But, Wilson says, this change 
has not compromised the complete-
ness of disaster planning. "The plan 
is fairly simple, but it's a lot more 
aggressive toward getting things 
down to an individual level," Wil-
son said.

Dominic Lobbla/ Guardlan 

But Palmer contends that, while 
a bit dull, it is important to at least 
raise student awareness of the dan-
gers. 

"It's hard to make safety and 
environmental consciousness ... , 
shall we say, 'dynamic.' II might 
seem trivial to very intelligent 
people, but many times, it's too easy 
for myself and others to overlook 
something simple. A moment's 
oversight can mean something," 

Departments and colleges have 
also been asked to develop disaster 
plans specific to their areas. 

One of the essential elements of 
the simpler plan is flexibility, ac-
cording to Wilson. There are sev-
eral different options for everything 
from communication networks to 
medical-care sites. 

"The plan is very involved. We 
have e-mail, walkie-talkies, even 
human walkers," Robbins said. 
. But regardless how well-devel-

oped the disaster plan is or how 
much drilling takes place, the pro-
cess is never complete. 

"We'll never be able to say, 
'Okay, we're all ready. Bring on the 
big one,' especially with the num-
ber of students and faculty turning 
over every year," Wilson said. 

For students, disaster prepared-
ness is mostly just a mindless lab-
safety lecture or a rude early morn-
ing awakening. But for anyone par-
ticipating in one of Wilson's table-
top disaster drills, it is much more

than that - it 's a mailer of life and 
death. 

Everyone silting around the con-
ference table knows there is no toxic 
cloud hovering above campus. Stu-
dents are not desperately gasping 
for breath outside their Pepper Can-
yon Apartments. They can afford to 
make a mistake this time.

Once a year the 

Greek community comes together 
to put on an event known as Greek 
Week. What many people do not 
know however, is that beyond the 
fun and games, Greek Week is a 
philanthropic event sponsored by 
the Panhellenic Association and 
Interfraternity Council. 

Traditionally, Greek 
Week raises money for local 
charities by various fundraising 
efforts throughout the week. This 
year, aU proceeds will go towards 
purchasing computer equipment 
for Doyle and Curie Elementary 
Schools. Adversely affected by 
extreme budget cuts in San Diego 
County, these schools lack many 
modern tools that assist teachers in 
educating their students. Further, 
we live in a computerized society 
and children need access to this 
technologywhichwillenablethem 
to become better s tudents and 
professionals. Panhellenicand IFC 
hope that their contribution of 
computer equipment will benefit 
these young students in just that 
manner.

for a small donation as well as bowls 
of chili for a meager price. This 
event will take place on the Price 
Center Walkway on March 1, 1995 
from lla.m. t02p.m. Proceeds from 
this event will go to the AIDS 
Foundation of San Diego. 

The Greek Olympics 
gives a new twist to Greek Week 
this year. In its first year in the 
making it will take on a " Revenge 
ofthe Nerds" theme. And, no, you 
don't have to be athletic to 
participate. Beginningat12:30p.m. 
and lasting until 3 p.m. on Friday 
March 3, 1995, fraternities and 
sororities will be paired up for the 
9 events. These will include a home 
run contest, 3 legged races, a toilet 
paper wrap, and an obstac1ecourse.

Tritons Pound Panthers Lions Roar Past UCSD 
SWEEP: UCSD takes two at Chapman DIVISION I aWES: Tritons fall in three sets

A loss tends to pÂ·tt everything in

set at Chapman University, the 

thers, 8Â·3 and 5-0, 

UCSD baseball

In Friday's showdown, Steve 
Height started his fourth game of the 
season and raised his record to 3-1 
with the triumph. The Tritons sup-
ported his fine pitching with eight 
runs on their way to racking up win 
number five. 

Height threw seven strong in -

ing just one. John Tichen and Thea

third in the javelin. 

Each UCSD relay team - the 4 
X 100 and 4 X 400 in both men's 
and women's divisions - garnered 
the silver medal in Saturday's meet. 

On the Triton men 's side, the 
highlight of the day was the 1,500-
meter race. Goss Lindsay (4:00,9) 
sprinted across the line in first, just 
ahead of J.J. Castner (4:01.3). 

Castner did double-duty, earning 
second place in the 5 ,000-meter 
event in a time of 15:24.9, while 
Alan Grant (I :57.3) also snatched 
up the si lver in the 800 meters. 

" It's a testament to [Castner 's] 
determination for him to run two 
races like that," Salerno aid . 

In the hammer throw, UCSD 's 
Geoff Lambert (150' 9.5") and 
Randy Buehler (150' 4 .0") crashed 
the second and third slots, whi Ie 
Andre Fabian (6") leaped (0 second 
in the high jump. 

UCSD had numerous third-place 
winners, such as Kirk Miller (liD 
and 400 hurdles), James Wiley (100 
meters), Creed Stary (pole vault), 
Clifford Marks (long jump) and 
Doug Olander (triple jump). 

" I was very pleased with this 
meet," Salerno said. "It was a total 
team effort, and it points to a very 
promising season ahead,"

Thursday night was just an-
other typical evening for the 
UCSD men's volleyball team. 

It traveled 
through Los An-
geles, on its way 
back from a two-

game set against 
highly-ranked 
Hawaii and got 
no break, run-
ning up against 
yet another 
tough Division r 
foe, Loyola 

Marymount University, 
The Tritons gave it the old col-

lege try, but once again came up 
short of victory, falling in straight 
sets, 15-12, 15-9, 15-7. 

"We matched up very well 
physically with them," Assistant 
Coach Greg Huffstutter said. " We 
just couldn't close out games." 

UCSD had a 12-8 advantage in 
the opening set of the contest be-

fore succumbing to the Lions by 
surrendering seven straight points. 

In the second game of the match, 
the Tritons again played hard-nosed 
ball, hanging with Loyola for the 
better part of the game, 

However, with the score knotted 
at nine, UCSD lost its offensive 
punch and dropped six-straight 
points to go down by an insur-
mountable two-sets. 

The Lions finished the job in 
three-sets, leaving the Tritons 
winless after eleven matches. 

UCSD was led by Tom Black 
and Tyson Kerr, each of whom tal-
lied 16 kills in the match. Also pro-
viding a spark was Ed McMahon, 
who smashed home14 balls. Black 
also played big on defense coming 
up with eight digs. Brian Hunnicutt 
also notched eight digs, 

" We are playing much better this 
season;" Huffstutter said, "We just 
haven ' t learned how to win games. 
We are not only facing other team's 
first strings this season, but our own 
inability to close out matches."

In addition, Kristy Schilling was

ing UCSD needed. Gil and Mounger 
combined for a four-hit shutout as 
they gunned down the Toreros by a 
4-0 tally.

their momentum from the win at

In game two, Sagert picked up 
her second victory of the day, limit-
ing the Tritons to a pair of singles. 
UCSD was never able to mount an 
offensive attack, while the Taros 
scored most of their runs in bunches 
with four in the fourth and five in 
the fifth . 

"They had a couple of good in-
nings where they were able to pick 
up some runs," Coach Gerckens 
said, "We need to have an explod-

runs. "

And if being a smog-infested, 
second-rate school wasn't enough, 
the Triton women also pummeled 
the Highlanders, 123-44 - only a 
point off the men's 80-point margin. 

" It was a very good day for us," 
Triton Head Coach Tony Salerno 
said. " It was one of our best dual 
meets ever." 

When the meet was over, both 
the UCSD men and women 
tracksters had held their own against 
their Division II rivals, crushing 
UCR, slipping by Cal Poly Pomona 
(98-97 and 100-81) and falling to 
Cal State L.A. (113-86 and 94-82). 

"Cal State [L.A.] is the favorite 
to win the conference champion-
ship," Salerno said. "But we did

very impressive." 

If anyone was the epitome of

Newcomer Kenya Thacker was 
her shadow, tying Shepard in the 
triple jump and notching a third-
place mark in the IOO-meter hurdles 
(16.63). 

The women 's 400-meter hurdles

Season-Ending Smashing 
FINALLY: UCSD beat 
Menlo in their last 
game of the season 
By Tedd Ladd 
Associate Sports Editor 

It was a fitting way to end the 
season. The UCSD men's basketball 
team (12-13), playing an opponent 

BH5KET 

!-~ .. ~ ... ~ .. ..: . .,... 
BRLL 

it had lost to 
twice earlier in 
the year, up-
staged Menlo 
College , 87-82, 
in front of the 
RIMAC rowdies 
last Friday. 

In many ways, 
the game was a 
telling tal e on 
how far the T ri-

tons have come since the beginning 
of the new Greg Lanthier coaching 
regime. It was a contest of explo-
sive three-point shooting, ' steady 
inside scoring and improving de-
fense. 

" We shot the ball extremely well, 
and that 's really our strength," 
Lanthier said. " Defensively, we 
looked tired." 

UCSD took control of the game 
early, aided by the multiple scoring 
inputs of Matt Aunc (20 points, 
eight rebounds), Jason Jones (16 
points) and Chris Christensen (II 
points, 3-5 on three-pointers). 

In particul ar, Matt Minehan's 
breakout performance - 21 points, 
seven rebounds, 3-5 on treys - led 
the Triton attack to a commanding 
48-42 halftime lead. 

" [Minehan] had a great game, 
and [Aune) was his usual steady 
self," Lanthier said. 

Coming into the break, UCSD 
had shot a red-hot 17-32 (.531) from 
the field and an equally sizzl ing 8-
17 (.471) from three-point land. Of 
course, Menlo shot .800 f rom the 
floor against a porous Triton defense 
to keep the game close. 

" If there 's any Achilles' heel on 

Jason Jones tallied 16 points In the Tritons' win over Menlo_ 

th is team, i t 's the problems on de-
fense," Lanthier said. " We' re still 
young, and it will get better wi th 
more experience." 

The Tritons cooled off a bit i n 
the second hal f of action, shoot ing 
an icier 13-28 (.464) from inside-
and 4-16 (.250) outside- the three-
point arc. 

UCSD 's talented forward, Kahlil 
Allen, stepped it up though, notch-
ing 17 buckets and pulling down 
four loose rebounds to keep his team 
ahead. 

"This was really one of(Allen's) 
better games. He grabbed a lot of 

boa rds and he hustled," Lanthier 
said . " He's always been responsive 
and improved." 

Menlo pulled into the lead with 
about two minutes to go - its first 
lead of the game - but couldn ' t 
hold on, and UCSD went on a last-
minute scoring flurry 10 go up fo r 
good. 

"This game was a good gauge of 
the progression we've made th is 
year," Lanlhier said . " We've clearl y 
gol a lot of skill, and we' re fun 10 
watch. Everyone's coming back, so 
we ' ll be tougher next year. Overall , 
it was a fun experience." 

UCSD Pulverizes Poets 
THRASHING: The Tritons made short work of Whittier, winning 304-377 
By Tedd Ladd 
Asociate Sports Editor 

It's kind of hard to gel excited 
about a win over a school that re-
cently posted a " Help Wanted: Join 

the Golf Team" 
sign in its student 
union. 

But a win is a 
win, and the 
UCSD golf squad 
has to feel some 
degree of pride 
over dismantling 
the Whittier Poets 
at last Tuesday 's 
dual match. 

"[Whittier] is not a very strong 
leam," Triton Head Coach Mike 
Wydra said. "But il was a fairly dif-
ficult course. " 

UCSD crushed the Poets by an 
astonishing 73 strokes, 304-377, on 
the Whittier home course of 
Friendly Hills Country Club. Head-
lining the Triton effort was up-and-
comer Arnie Campbell , who 
medaled by shooting a solid 73. 

" [Campbell's] playing very well 
right now, and he 's leading the 
team," Wydra said. " I asked him 
about ' his low score, and he only 

said, 'I'm baffled. '" 
Tom Brown took Ihe second 

scoring slot for UCSD with an ex-
ceptional 74, barely slipping to 
Campbell 's mark by a single stroke. 

Jim O'Grady played into the 
third Triton team spot, notching a 
respectable round on the links and 
garnering a 78-stroke total. 

Teammate Alex Behrend wasn ' t 
far behind, grabbing the last scor-
ing place with a low 79 on Ihe 
course. 

UCSD's Brian Walter and Jer-
emy Byrd also aided the team 's ef-
forts, hilling an 82 and an 84, re-
spectively - in the non-scoring five 
and six slots. 

Their scores weren ' t nearly as 
unnecessary as Whittier 's last non-
scoring player, however. 

"Whittier 's lasl guy shot a 129. 
Of course, they threw it out," Wydra 
said, " But I can ' t wait to see this guy 
play again. Records will be broken." 

The Tritons limped into their 
next tournament - sponsored by 
the San Diego Golf Academy - at 
local-area Whispering Palms Golf 
Course on Friday. 

Among the 14 teams competing, 
UCSD finished at the middle of the 

pack, totaling a slightly disappoint-
ing 311 team mark for the tourney. 

With All-Americans Mike Hart-
ford and Pele Roberts out because 
of red-shirting and injury complica-
tions - and standout player Tom 
Brown stuck in class - the Triton 
golfers were hurting. 

Byrd rose above it all , however, 
coming out of nowhere for UCSD 
by stunning his leam with his phe-
nomenal76. 

" [Byrd 's) been on the team the 
last couple of years and has had 
trouble breaking into Ihe top six ," 
Wydra said. " He 's a wonderful 
story ... He had never even seen this 
course before." 

Campbell shot a second-place 
77, while fellow Triton Behrend was 
again only a stroke away with an 
impressive 78. 

O 'Grady snatched up the final 
UCSD team slot with an 80-stroke 
total. Walter 's 86 score was nixed 
in the non-scoring fifth spot. 

" It was a bad lournament for us, 
and we were looking down at our 
shoes the whole time," Wydra said. 
" Now, we ' re looking ahead. I 'm 
worried, though, that in our weak-
ened condition we' re pummel-bait."

Can't Skate 
Into-My Heart 

Tell me that I throw the ball 
like a girl or that I have a 
hairdo like Don King. Call me 
a poor sport or a male chauvin-
ist pig, if you like. Okay, 
maybe not the Don King part. 
He looks as though he has 
some kind of permanent 
electric stimulus running 
through his body and escaping 
straight out the top of his head 
into outer space, sort of like 
the light coming out the top of 
Luxor. 

Tritons Celebrate NCAA Bid 

Anyhow, you can call me 
anything. But just don 't call 
me a fan of figure skating. 

I was flipping through the 
stations on Saturday afternoon 
when - in stunned horror - I 
realized that in the span of two 
channels, I had seen two -
count them two - figure 
skating events. Yes folks, 
being televised at one time, on 
two of this nation 's big-four 
networks, were the European 
and American figure skating 
championships. 

Now, I may be a wacky 
sporting purist of some sort, 
but I just never considered this 
catastrophic event to be a 
possibility ... except of course 
during the Olympics when 
both the red and blue channels 
of that idiotic NBC Triplecast 
juggernaut had ice skating on 
at 2 a.m. 

TOURNEY: UCSD 
ends at 18-6; will travel 
to MN for round one 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

You work your tail off all year 
long in practice and in games, giv-
ing every ounce for the team in the 

hopes that you 
can experience 
the thrill of play-
ing in the NCAA 
playoffs. For the 
Triton women's 
basketball team, 
this dream has 
become a reality, 
thanks to its best 
seas~n in recent 
memory. UCSD 

. amassed an 18-6 record which it 
topped off with convincing victories 
over Christian Heritage and Point 
Loma Nazarene on Thursday and 
Saturday to qualify for the Division 
111 version of the "big dance." 

"We've really had to work hard 
this season because we ' re so 
young," Head Coach Judy Malone 
said. "It 's pretty exciting [to be go-
ing to NCAAs]." 

The Tritons impressed the selec-
tion committee with their final two 
victories, gaining admission into the 
64-team field. But it was by the nar-
rowest of margins that they earned 
the eighth and final spot in the West-
ern region. 

I always figured that the 
networks would have the 
sense, nay - the common 
decency - to follow the 
golden rule of the red-
blooded, burger-eating 
American sports fan : Thou 
shalt not televise two figure 
skating events simultaneously. 
If thou must televise one, then 
thou hadst better offer an 
alternative on a nearby channel 
that involves big sweaty guys 
or else risk a sudden outbreak 
of boredom induced comas. 

It was Thursday night's victory 
over Point Loma, a typically strong 
NAIA opponent, that did the trick 
for UCSD. The Crusaders were un-
able to handle the Tritons' high-

Sarah Schneider grabbed the ball and UCSD grabbed a win from Point Loma to clinch an NCAA bid. 

Okay, perhaps I am being 
too harsh. Yes, figure skating 
is an incredibly athletic 
activity. But, I've always felt 
that any sport which is scored 
on the basis of "artistic 
impression" is tediously 
dangling on the very edges of 
sportdom. 

powered offensive attack from the 
outset as UCSD jumped to a 10-
point lead and maintained that cush-

ion throughout the game. 
The Tritons enjoyed 

an 11-point margin go-
ing into the half at 38-27, 
and held the Point Loma 
squad at bay for the ma-
jority of the second half 
until the Crusaders made 
a late run. Point Loma 
tallied six points in the 
final minute, with 
UCSD's reserves com-
ing off the bench to put 
the game to bed, but 
never threatened to steal 
the victory. 

The Tritons walked 
away with the 70-63 tri-
umph and the security 
that the win would likely 
ensure them a playoff 
birth. 

I have to admit, the jumps 
are dazzling at times, however, 
it is rather mind-boggling to 
most of us "average Joes" how 
the announcers manage to tell 
a triple-sow-cow from a 
quadruple-c1utz. 

I can assure you that this 
oversight by the networks will

The UCSD seniors made their 
presence felt in their final home ap-
pearance. Michelle Henricks 
poured in 17 points to lead the Tri-
tons in scoring. 

UCSD also got offensive fire 
power from senior forward Tami

UCSD's comfortable lead also

night. That first-round game will 
force UCSD to travel east to Min-
nesota for a showdown with the 
number-one ranked team in the re-
gion, SI. Benedict's College (24-1). 

"We've played some real good 
teams this year, and I think we're 
ready," Malone said. "I don't think 
they can throw anything at us that 
we haven't seen. I figure we have to 
play the top-ranked team sooner or 
later." 

The Tritons' task will be made 
harder by the long plane trip to the 
great white North. However, 
UCSD's outlook is positive. 

"All we will think about is the 
game," Malone said. "We'll be to-
gether and focus as a team. We just 
have to rise to that level. We've done 
it when we had to this year."
