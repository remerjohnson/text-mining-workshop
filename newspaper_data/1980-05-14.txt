KSDTRadio 
Cable Has Been 
Its Main Outlet 

BY LARRY FINKEL 
Aher years of transmitting 

via cable-, UCSlJ student radio 
alation KSDT may finally be 
on the road to on-campua 
broadcuting. 

Except for severailpOradic 
periods of on-c·ampus 
tranarniuion, KSDT has not 
been receivable anywhere at 
UCSD withQut special 
equipment. 

Now, however, some Muir 
and Revelle students can pick 
up the station on 540 AM, and 
by next fall Warren and Third 
colleges should also be able to 
receive KSDT, according to 
SeoH E1isberg, chief engineer 
at the station. 

One of KSDT's primary 
difficulties in broadcasting on 
campus has been a lack of 
funding, according to several 
station members.

Speaks at a $25-a-Head Luncheon 
BY ERIC JAYE 

His campaign in its eleventh hour, Senator 
Edward Kennedy pressed on through San Diego 
yesterday, saying that his continued candidacy 
gives Democrats a "voice and a vote." 

"If Mr. Carter had his way, then you would 
close down the shop right now," Kennedy said, 
claiming that for him to quit now would 
disenfranchise Democrats in the remaining 
primary states. 

(Kennedy was soundly defeated by President 
Carter yesterday in both the Maryland and 
Kansas primaries. See page 3.) 

"I believe that the 20 million citizens of 
Califomia ... are entitled to have a chance to 
express th~ir concern over (llatters that concern 
them most deeply," Kennedy told a gathering of 
approximately 300 San Diego Democratic 
party · luminaries, whose $25 bought them 
a sandwich, apple and soda, and a chance to 
press the flesh with Kennedy and his wife Joan. 

At the luncheon, Kennedy offered up his 
traditional campaign platfol'm, criticizing Carter 
for his handing of the economy and calling on 
the president to debate. 

Saying that Carter had "wrung his hands of 

the problems we are having here and abroad," 
Kennedy promised that if elected he would 
impose immediate freezes and "wages, prices 
and profits,~' which he would slowly lift as the 
condition of the economy improved. 

He did not say how he would handle the 
country's problems overSeas. 

Kennedy's brief campaign stop was limited to 
the outdoor luncheon in the garden of former 
San Diego City Councilwoman Maureen 
O'Connor's Hillcrest home, and press 
conferences for lhe local working press and 
student media. 

With a small contingent of San Diego State 
University "Students for Kennedy" present, the 
senator addressed several student-related 
ISSUes.

Riley Manipulated Meeting 
Editor: 

On Friday, May 9, I 
attended the Reg Fee 
Committee meeting, reported 
on by Jeff Beresford-Howe of 
the Daily Guardian on 
Monday, May 12. During that 
meeting an incident occured 
which appalled me and was 
not reported by the Guardian 
reporter. . . 

During that meeting, Liz 
Riley , chairwoman, and 
Bonnie Higley, campus 
budget analyst , proposed an 
alternative legal services 
program to the current 
program, headed by Nick 
Aguilar. 

"While Mr. Aguilar was 
presenting his defense of the 
current program, several notes 
were passed from Higley to the 
chair, via the Guardian 
reporter. Also, various nods 
and motions were exchanged 
between Riley and Higley. 

After awhile, a final note 
was passed from Riley to 
Higley. Higley then passed the 
note to a woman to her right 
and told her to read it. The 
note instructed the woman to 
second a motion, to be made 
by Higley, to end discussion. 

The girl nodded to Hislley, 
then Higley nodded to RJIey. 
Then, the action proceeded as 
planned. Higley raised her 
hand, and Riley immediately 
called upon her. Higley then 
motioned for dicussion to end, 
and the woman to her right 
1eC0nded the motion, as per 
the note. A general vote then 
ended dilcuasion. 

Thil incident raises serious 
CJleltiona u to the ~of 
those involved in the . . t. 

reporter who observed the 
covert communications failed 
to report the incident even 
after alluring me that he 
would. 

Most importantly, the 
Iegitim8(:y of the commiHee's 
operations and that of its chair, 
must be questioned. If the 
committee has operated like 
this aU }:ear then it is the fault 
of the .,stem, in that it has no 
checks and balances to 
prevent a dominant chair from 
controlling a committee . 

Even if this was the first time 
the chair hasjrrfluenced, even 
planned , a motion, (which for 

those unfamiliar with 
commiUee procedure, i. 
illegitimate), an investigation 
is mandated. 

It is our hope that the 
iUegitimate and unfair actions 
in this case are confined to a 
single incident within a single 
committee. However, 
whenever such abuses do 
occur, we trust that prompt 
investigation by campus 
officials, as well as diligent 
reporting by the Guardian, will 
maintain the integrity of the 
committee process.

Southside Johnny's 
Jukes No I Pretenders 
Editor: 

I am writing in response to the leiter you printed Friday, May 
9, 1980 by Susan Self concerning the upcoming 'Southside 
Johnny concert. I sincerely apologize for the pain Susan and any 
others present at the Pretenders conced went through as a result 
of the loud sound level. I am happy to see that Susan realized 
that the Pretenders own technicians control the sound level for 
their concerts. This is not to say that the sound level is beyond 
the control of Pop Events, but one must keep in mind that it's 
hard to please everyone. The Pretenders sound technician was 
mixing the sound out in the audience so he must have had the 
sound at a level he believed right for the band. In addition, many 
of my friends thought the sound to be just righl. I reiterate my 
apologies for any disappoinbnent from the concert, but thank 
you for your input. 

In regard to the upcoming Southside Johnny and the Asburll 
Juke. concert, I personally don't see an}' chance for a repeat 
disappointment. On Friday, June 6, Pop Events will present one 
of the greatest concerts ever to come to UCSD. "The Jukes" are 
a ten piece band who perform an incredible stage show. We will 
be using the biggest.tage ever utilized in the gym to accolllOdate 
a fuillized' acou.tic grand piano, a five piece hom section, and 
the rest of "The Jukes", including South,side Johnny who creates 
a atage presence all his own. The Pop Events committee and I 
are working very closely with Sou,hslde Johnnll'S tour manaBers 
and technicians to make this the best concert 10 come to UCSO 
ever.

committee did not allow

If self-help development can

porated c ommunity of 
120,000 where unemploy-
ment is nearly 17 percent and 
the INS has only recently 
stopped household raids on 
"iIIegals" - it could be used in 
poor com;;)unities anywhere. 

But just as TELACU is 
becoming a power in East Los 
Angeles, the group's key to 
generating profits is under 
aHack by some government 
officials, and federal spending 
cutbacks are effect ively 
preventing similar groups from 
adoptinl{ TELACU's strategy. 

"We' re a model , a 
showcase," says TELACU's 
John Echeveste. "The feds 
know that we will produce. But 
there's no new money for other 
community development 
corporations, and that isolates 

" our success. 
The cause of the 

controversy is TELACU's 
development strategy, an 
ingenioU5Systemthat combines 
job training and federally-. 
subsidized wages with profit-
maki"8 business oper ations. It 
is a radical departure from the 
1960. poverty programs that 
kept poor communities 
hanging on the welfare dollar. 

"Our community really has 
more in common with 
underdeveloped Third World 
nations than we do with most 

. our neighboring cities," says 
David Lizarraga, TELACU's 
executive director and a native 
of East LA. "We suffer from 
the same economic problems: 
unhealthy balance of 
payments, poor ,industrial 
development, and a dollar 
cirrolation that Rows outside 
of the community. 

"We're using the same 
concepts here that are use~ in 
the Third World because if you 
don't have a strong economy, 
you have a weak community." 

TELACU's social service 
director, Roy Escarcega, 
explained the strategy last 
month in Santa Fe to wide-
ey'ed representatives from 
much smaller community 
development corporations 
(COC'.) across the Southwest. 

"There's no secret to this 
operation," he says. "We use 
$ 7 _ I million in' city, county, 
state and federal manpower 

, grants to pay for some of the 

labor in our lor-profit 
businesses. We essentially 
create an economy in the 
barrio, where there was none, 
by capturing government-
supported labor for other 
operations." 

T-ELACU Industries, for 
instance, includes a trucking 
company, a weatherization 
business, a maintenance and 
security company , and 
various financial and 
investment centers. The for-
profit companies hire workers 
from the non· profit agencies, 
including several CET A 
offi c es that TELACU 
operates as a prime sponsor 
for both the city and county of 
Los Angeles. 

" It's essentially a sma ll 
mixed economy, a partnership 
with the government," says 
Lloyd Lee, an attorney for the 
Economic Development Law 
Project .in · Berkeley , 
California. "COC's probably 
couldn't survive without 
federal support, but neither 
could Chrysler, Lockheed or 
Boeing." 

TELACU makes all this 
work in the barrio by being 
tough and business-like. "The 
only steady income in East LA 
is welfare," Escarcega tells 
new recruits. "What do you 
want us to do, adopt you?" 

TELACU emphasizes 
hands-on work experience in 
its training programs, using 
journeymen crafts workers in 
carpentry and plumbing, and a 
special school for security 
guards. "We identify the good 
guys, and then hire as. many as 
we can," Escarcega says. 

The group plans to 
computerize its entire 
operation, recruiting from its 
own CET A workers for 
pro.grammers and k e y 
punchers. 

"We're bidding now on 
contracts for electronic 
maintenance of military 
equipment," Escarcega adds . 
" It's good clean work, and by 
using CET A workers, one· 
quarter of our overhead is 
already paid for." 

Stock 1 0r all of the 
TELACU industries - now 
worth some $60 miUion - is 
held by a non-profit TELACU 
holding company. A board of 
15 elected community 
membrs control the for-profit 
businesses. 

Critics of · the organization 
say aU of this amounts to self-
dealing at the taxpayer 
expense. Some local officials 
have threatened to intervene,

Carter, Reagan Top 
Maryland and Neb. 

President Carter won the 
Mary land and Nebras ka 
presidential primary elections 
Tuesday night , bu t Sen. 
Edward M. Kennedy vowed in 
de fea t to co nti nu e his 
campaign despite the towering 
odds aga inst him. 

~onald Reagan captured 
the two Republican prim aries 
and said he was confident, 
"most optimistic," that soon he 
wi ll c l in c h th e GOP 
nomination. 

In this latest installment of 
the long primary parade, 
Carter and Reagan widened 
the ir runaway leads in 
nominating votes. 

George Bush would need a 
virtual sweep of all the 
remaining GOP delegates to 
reach nominating strength_ 

Carter led for 46 delegates , 
which would bring his national 
total to 1,365. He needs 
1,666 for renomination. 
Kennedy was ahead for 36 of 
Tuesday's delegates, which 
would put his overall count at 
770. 

Kennedy, in Albuquerque, 
NM, said he had "expected to 
do better," but added, "there 
really isn't that much of a 
difference" in their delef;late 

coun ts In t he Tuesday 
primaries. 

But there is a big difference 
between their situations , since 
Ca rt er can cli n ch th e 
nomini/,ion so long as he gets 
about 26 percent of the 
re m aini n g Democratic 
delegates. 

Kennedy said he would 
continu e the camp aig n, 
looking for a comeback in the 
big final primaries , beca use "I 
believe a political party must 
stand for something." 

Reagan's lopsided Nebras-
ka victory over Bush was in a 
preferential vote that did not 
bind delegates. They were 
e lected s eparately , and 
Republi can s pled ged to 
Reagan led for 24 national 
convention seats and one 
Bush supporter was ahead. 

Reagan led for another 15 
delegates in Maryland. That 
would give him a total of 817 
of the 998 he needs to gain 
nomination. Bush was ahead 
for 15 delegates , for a 
prospective total of 187. That 
meant he'd have to win 96 
percent of all the Republican 
de.legates yet to be chosen in 
order to fashion a majority.

Evita Nominated 
For 11 Tony's 

NEW YORK - FOllr 
musicals - two made in 
England a nd two in America 
- have each been nominated 
fo r Tony awards for best 
musical , best book and best 
score on Broadway thi s 
season. 

The verdict came Monday 
from a 12-member panel of 
theater professiona ls and 
journalist s who pick e d 
nominees in 19 ca tegories for 
the 34th annual Tony awards 
show. CBS- will air the show 
June 8. 

The thrice-nominated 
English imports are "Evita" 
and the newly-opened " A Day 
in Hollywood, A Night in the 
Ukraine." The Yank shows 
are "Sugar Babies" and 
another new entry, "Barnum." 

Among musicals, "Evita," 
about Argentina's Eva Peron, 
got the most nominations, II. 
"Talley's Folly," the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning play about love 
in rural Missouri , logged the 
most lor drama - five. 

Old pro Mickey Rooney, 

passed over for an Oscar for 
his work in "The Black 
Stall ion," might take home a 
Tony. The star of "Sugar 
Babies," he's been nominated 
for best actor in a mus ical. . 

But he's up against stiff 
competition from Jim Dale in 
"Barnum" and Gregory Hines 
of the since-folded "Comin' 
Uptown." A fourth contender 
is Giorgio Tozzi of the failed 
"Most Happy Fella" revival . 

Bob Gunton and Mandy 
Patinkin of " Evita" each were 
nominated, as were Debbie 
Allen and Jossie de Guzman 
of "West Side Story." 

The men face Harry 
Groener of "Oklahoma" a.'ld

At least one administrator is 

opposed to any funding for a 
business manager at KSDT. 
Roland Buck,. Student Center 
director, believes the station 
should be receivable on the 
entire campus before such an 
allocation is made. 

Last year, KSDT received 
$8,000 from the AS 
Opportunity Budget. Prior to 
this over $100,000 had been 
invested to start the station. 

The station claims that is 
has potentially the largest 
coverage of any FM station in 
the nation, through broadcasts 
on three cables. 

KSDT has been slow to 
transmit on campus because it 
has 110t been a high priority at 
UCSD, according to 
Rockwell. 

At least one former KSDT 
director, too, "wasn't 
concerned with the campus at 
all, but was only interested in

Rockwell adds. But now, 
KSDT members want to focus 
more on campus, he says. 

In addition to financing 
troubles, on·campus broad· 
casting has been impeded by 
membership turnovers in the 
AS and KSDT, and by 
stringent Federal Communica· 
tion Commission (FCC) 
regulations, according to 
Rockwell.

Kennedy Brings Campaign 
Pitch to San Diego Luncheon 

Says He's Not Continuing Campaign to Maintain Pride 

Continued from page J 
"Tuition hal gone up 30 percent in three 

years and the Carter administration is cutting 
back scholarships for California students," 
Kennedy said, daiming he would see this and 
other problems faced by young and poor people 
"in more human terms." 

Kennedy lost his temper with a reporter from 
La Jolla High who sought to question him on his 
authorship of a Senate biU rewriting the federal 
penal code. Kennedy has been criticized by 
liberal groups for his support of the bill. 

At the Student media press conference 
Kennedy said that contrary to what his aides 
have been quoted as saying, he is I)ot continuing _ 
his campaign to maintain his pride. 

/ He questianed the reporter sharply on details 
of the bill, and when he could not answer, 
Ke!lnedy told him "if you' re asking a question, 
you better know the material ." 

"I've been in rhe Senate for 17 years and I'm 
proud of my work there," he told a KSDT 
reporter. ( 

Kennedy was on edge, an aide confided, 
because the local press had "given him a hard 
time of it."

4. WOOlen in Tennis Regionals, Without T eaOl 
BY SAMANTHA ROBY 

Staff Wriler • 
As the UCSD Women' s 

Tennis Team's regular season 
wound down, the Triton's 
found themselves just shy of a 
futr.team regional berth. They 
split their final two league 
matches, beating California 
Lutheran College 7·2 and 
losing to Westmont College 5· 

The Westmont match was 
the deciding factor in the 
Triton's post·season future -
a win would have put the team 
in regionals, a loss would leave 
them without a berth. The top· 
fini shing teams of the three 
leagues of this region go to 
regionals, as do the three 
teams with the next best 
records {not neces arily from 

Three UCSD women's termis leam players are eligible to 
compete in this week's regionall.

the three different leagues). 
Coach Liz Dudash felt sure 
that the Tritons would make 
regionals one of the two ways. 

Unfortuna tely , the team as 
a whole will not be going to 
regionals this Thursday 
through Saturday, but will be 
sending # I seed Cecelia 
Ka va n aug h , #6 see d 
E lizabeth Saar and the #2 
seed doubles team of Laura 
Smith and Carolyn Shugart. 
These Tritons got their place 
in regionals because aside 
from the six full teams, there 
a re two additional berths for 

each seed. To fill these slots, 
the top players of their 
resJ>ective positions are invited 

The Daily' Guardian 

Sports 
to att end. 
Dudash feels certain that the 
regional·bound Tritons will 
give it thei r bes t shot and make 
a good showing lor UCSD. 

Dudash is pleased with her 
first season as Triton 

Women's Tennis Coach. She 
has enjo-yed coaching and has 
seen the team progress greatly 
from the first practices. This 
progress is evident in their 
performance against West· 
mont. Although they lost both 
contests, the 7·2 score of the 
first match was bettered to 5·4 
in the second match. 

Dudash feels that her rookie 
coaching season has been 
"really fun ." "Since I'm so 
close to them in age, I feel 
more like a friend than an 
authoritarian-type coach."

Smiles Overshadow Com etitiveness 

All Cals Fulfill 1M Ideals 
BY TIM LIOTTA 

Sport. Editor 
It resembled a broadway 

opening. . 
A dedicated group of people 

pouring all of their time and 
energy into the production, 
knowing it was a one·shot deal 
- make or break. But, when 
the curtain fell for the final 
time, they knew they had a hit 
on their hands . 

Brooks Atkinson would 've 
labeled it "a smash". Walter 
Kerr would 've called it "a must 
for any intramural athlete" . 

It was billed a.s the "15th 
Annual A11·CaI Intramural 
Festival." The UCSD 
Intramural staff produced and 
direCted the two-day affair, 
offering the audience an 
unparelleled production of 
coed softball, volleyball and 
tennis. 

There would be no dress 
rehearaal for the staff of the 1M 
department. Friday momi"i 
would bring with it eight UC 
schools and an atmosphere 
packed with tension. 1M 
Sporta Alli.tanta took care of 
the last minute details, while 
the hosts and ho.telles, 
UCSD studenta, rehearled 
wliat they would tell the 
athletes from the vi.iting 
school. they had been 
auiJned. 

1M'. Alli.lant Director 
Scott Berndes kept one eye 
peeled toward the aky - rain 
would've ,been a personal 
in.ult. SpOrts A.sistant Erin 
A'heam was frantic 81 the 

anticipated problems which 
never arose. The show would 
go on. 

The idea behind the 
production was to bring 
together athletes from 'each of 
the UC campus ' Intramural 
programs in a friendly 
atmosphere. They could share 
the competitive experience, 
meet athletes from other 
campuses and compare the 
different programs. It was also 
an opportunity for the UCSD 
1M department to strut their 
stuff, show their guests just 
what this campus has to offer. 

The UC Davis athletes, clad 
in hawaiian shirts which 
would've made Don Ho 
proud, arrived first. They still 
were a bit weary. Their 4:45 
am wakeup time had proved to 
be too much for some of their 
athletes: their tennis duo 
overslept, missing the flight 
-south. They did manage to 
catch a later flight, joining the 
competitions late. 

The group from UC Irvine 
provided the UCSD staff with 
their first headache. Due to 
arrive at 9:30 am, their 
athletes strolled into the 
festival somewhere arol1nd 
11. Their hostess, Kerry 
Muse, spent the hour and a 
half waiting in the 1M office, 
when she could've slept in. 

As the other campuses from 
,he north arrived, the festivities 
began to take the shape of an 
Intramural competition. UC 
Berkeley threw out the 
"ceremonial" firat pitch 

around 1 1: 15 am and the 
games began. 

Once the games began , 
there was no stopping them. 
They were the epitome of what 
intramurals are supposed to 
be. The teams were laughing, 
enjoying the competitive spirit 
and "just plain havin' a good , 
time". Winning was almost 
secondary. 

The teams fielded by UCSD 
fared very well on the playing 
field , but their performance on 
the field couldn't compare with 
thei r performances off the 
field. 

Glen "Crazy Legs" Calla, a 
UCSD senior, turned a lot of 
heads with a brand of base 
running which was near 
daredevilish. But when he 
wasn't playing he shared a side 
of UCSD most people who go 
to this school don't get to see. 
He, along with Freddie Blesch, 
Ricky Robinson and Steve 
Shaw laughed with the visitors 
and enjoyed their company. 
The girls, Gail Sherman, Jane 
T oggenberger, Lisa Neely and 
Sheila O'Brien, not only made 
their opponents feel at home 
but turned a few heads at the 
same time. 

The UCSD volleyball team 
took the idea behind the 
competition and perfected it. 
Rich Schmidt, Chris Liotta 
and Ralph Haywood teamed 
up with Kerry Muse, Jane 
Bronson and Susan Raub, and 
graced the volleyball courts 
with more smiles and good 
times than any 1M team has

Ralph Haywood, along with KelTY Muse (foreground) 
and the rest of the 1M Department were sky high this week 
as hOlta of the 15th annual AII·Cals. 
ever enjoyed. 

The audience waited with 
anticipation as the scene 
switched to the International 
Center for Act II. 

The band, Ughtning, kept 
the show moving with their 
beat guiding the feet of the 
athletes across the dance floor. 
Volleyball players from 
Berkeley boogied with the 
softballers from Irvine. 
Athletes from all of the 
campuses mixed, showing 
they had as many moves on 
the dance floor as they did on 
the fields of competition. 

The only thing the dance 
didn't enjoy was the fine voice 
of Anthony Filer. His fans 
called for an appearance, but 
he wouldn't upstage the band. 

After the splendid opening 
acts, the pressure was really 
on for Act III, the finale, to be 
the smash ending to a great 
show. 

Saturday morning, how· 
ever, the rains refused to heed 
the threats of Berndes any 
longer. They washed out the 
plans for the afternoon. A 
barbeque which was 
scheduled for the Mission Bay 
Aquatic Center was moved 
back to the Rec Conference 
room . The over·the·line 
tournament was replaced by a 
day of volleyball and softball, 
pickup games mostly. 

The foul weather dampen. 
ed the spirits of Mike Hipp and 
Scott Berndes, the directors of 
the sm8lh hit. Though their 
audience enjoyed the make· 

shift third act, the directors felt 
a bit disheartened that their 
original plans were a washout. 

The Saturday festivities 
however took an unantici· 
pated turn. Athletes from the 
nine campuses, while 
munching on fine cuisine from 
the stove of Steve Crowder 
and Larry Van Denboss, 
watched the Laker· 76er game 
on a color television. It was a 
unique ' experience as fans 
from all over the state 
analyzed the pray gn the 
screen. Everybody was a self· 
professed expert and nobody 
would concede a single basket. 

The rainy festivities ended 
with the most important 
competitions of them all - a 
chug-a·lug contest. In a heated 
race, UCSD proved to be too 
quick for a cocky UCLA 
foursome. 

As the day wound to an 
end, each school bid the 
remaining athletes good·bye. 
When the last school had left, 
the UCSD crew slumped over 
the available chairs, 
exhausted. They looked at 
each other. They knew it had 
been a success. 

The smiles and fond 
memories of the visiting 
athletes would replace even 
the longest of standing 
ovations. No audience 
could've paid the players a 
bigger compliment than 
sharing their joys and good 
times with them. There is no 
greater ovation than an ear·to· 
ear smile.

Bulletin 
Not Just Another 
tGet Involved' Letter -

Cooperatives Abound 
Throughout Campus 

BY BRAD BARHAM 
Just reading another "Get Involved" 

article, as you prepare to vote in just 
another AS election, for what will be 
just another school year, 1979·80. Is 
that your attitude? 

Probably not. .. Everyone has their 
own plans and hig~ hopes for next 
year, a positive altitude over all. But, 
just try asking students to Get Involved 
and help improve the quality of life at 
UCSD, you might be surpirsed how 
quickly their high hopes and positive 
attitudes become cynical observations 
and negative altitudes. . 

To be sure, negative attitudes 
toward student government are 
understandable, but they go nowhere, 
accomplish nothing except to allow 
administrators to make unchallenged, 
unquestioned decisions, which directly 
affect our college experience. The AS, 
however, offers students the 
opportunity to work together to 
innuence the decision making process 
of this university. . 

With student involvement, the AS 
can exert a powerful influence on this 
school. Students working within a 
better organized and strongly 
supported AS could affect changes in 
Academic Policies, Bookstore 
Operations, University Programming, 
Library hours, and Housing problems 
to name a few areas. 

Eleven AS officers and twelve 

college reps can simply not effectively 
voice student opinions. Your support is 
needed. 

Besides improving our community, 
getting involved offers many personal 
rewards. If you choose to participate 
on a campus wide committee, then you 
will be meeting with faculty and 
administrators on a regular basis. They 
may become excellent sources for 
recommendations, if you can earn their 
respect as an effective student 
representative. In addition, on your 
resume involvement will show your 
concern and contributions to your 
community. 

More importantly, being involved 
wal enable you to enhance your 
education. College is more than just 
one lecture after another, more than 
midterms, papers, books and finals. 
College is experiencing the ideas, 
people, and society around you. 
Moreover, college is a safe testing 
ground for ideas, decision making, 
abilities, and skills in meetings and 
dealing with a whole variety of people. 

The applicaton below is your tic,ket 
for involvement. There are over sixty 
campl!swlde committees under the 
jurisdicton of the AS with openings for 
you. Also, each of . the elected 
commilSioners will have a commission 
of students working on ilSues and 
actions.

There are several new & continuing 
student cooperatives on campus which 
actively solicit participation. 
Cooperatives are services which are 
owned & democratically managed by 
students. The prices therefore reflect 
the cost of operation, not the lining of 
an investor's pocket. Becoming a 
member provides students with 
discount rates, business experience & 
the rare opportunity to participate in 
collective decision making. 

The Food Coop has been in 
existence since the summer of 1978 & 
its services ha ve increased by leaps & 
bounds. The Recycling Coop began as 
an offshoot of the Food Coop, as 
members became increasingly aware 
of the need to provide this valuable 
service on campus. 

The great response to this group's 
effort has shown the overwhelming 
concern we have for conservation. 
The Collee Hut Collective opened last 
Friday. It represents yet another 
expression by concerned students, 
addressing the needs for healthy food 
and alternative organizational 
structure. The Garden club brings us 

. fresh , organically grown produce from 
our own campus land which would 
otherwise lie idle. ASaorted Vinyl, the 
AS's first attempt at a cooperative 
student service, opened early thi. 
quarter. Services include trading used 
records, and purchasing records at 

~ces below retail Itores in the area. 
The General Store Coop is now in the 
planning stages. It will open during fall 
quarter, offering a large variety of 
sundry items. 

Groundworks is a bookstore run as a 
collective. Their selection of books and 
their management structure reflect 
their work to develop socialist 
consciousness in the participants and 
interested community. The new 
indicator collective publishes a bi· 
weekly newspaper of current political 
and social issues, emphasizing the 
historical perspective to a greater 
degree than is commonly found in 
established media. Politjournal, a 
student publication of social science 
research papers with critical insight, is 
nearing its deadline for accepting 
contributions of this nature. 

The Women's Center provides 
invaluable service through numerous 

study groups which gather information 
& act on current pertinent issues. 
They are organizing support groups to 
deal with various topics of concern to 
both women and men. 

These are just it few of the many 
opportunities to participate in campus 
activities which directly affect you. 

'Silliness' 
Pervades 
Committees' 
STUDENTS (SiUy or Otherwise)! 

You will recall .that one Silly 
Campaign Promise wa. to bring 
sillines. to the .tudenta rather than 
keep it bottled up in the Student Center. 
In keeping in line with !hi. promise 
(Silly People alway. keep promilel), 
we will e.tablish committeea with 
impressive titles with the entire .tudent 
body as members . Therefore, 
everyone will be in on the fun. 

For those of you who are so inclined 
towards silliness at an organized level, 
there are a few specific committees 
with impressive titles that need a few 
specific Silly Studenta to devote Iota of 
time to the endeavor of silliness (i.e. we 
want YOU to get siJly with US). 

Just look for the Very Silly Man in 
the bathrobe on Friday in Revelle 
Plaza and sign your name to one of his 
lists. DO NOT miss out on this chance 
of a lifetime to brighten your resume. 
DO NOT be dull and boring. BE 
SILL Y - even if you do not know why 
you are doing it. Milk and cookies will 
be served at committee interviews.

Marino Sounds Like Hendrix Stuck in 60s 
What's Next 
Frank Marino and Mahogany 
Rush (Colombia) 

The story goes that a young 
Frank Marino freaked out on 
bad acid some years ago, and 
after being given a guitar by 
his doctors as part of his 
recovery therapy, he was soon 
playing exactly like the 
deceased Jimi Hendrix despite 
the fact that he had previously 
never touched the instrument. 

Marino said in ea rly 
interviews that he believed the 
spirit of Jimi had entered him 
during his recovery, and that 
he had been changed from 
being just another teenage 
doper into someone who 
would carryon what Hendrix 
had begun. So the story goes. 

What you can say about 
Marino, whether you swallow' 
that crock or not, is that he 
does sound like Hendrix. But 
instead of "carrying on" the 
gui tar stylistics and advancing 
the art of electric guitar, 
Marino's playing is some-
where in the late 60s, fast and 
furious, full of echo, feedback , 
and, unlike Hendrix ' s 
occasional moments of bluesy 
lyricism, utterly graceless. The 
problem is singular: Marino 
and Mahagony Rush are 
incapable of writing a decent 
riff, a failing that results in 
Marino spil~ng onanistic solos 
over the material like a meat 

and potatoes slob drowning 
the most expensive plate at the 
Top Of The Cove in ketchup. 

Although one has to 
concede Marino's adeptness, 
his style becomes wearisome. 
In the end, What's Next,their 
newest record, seems aimed at 
the audience who's turned 
Hendrix into a dei ty and 
refused to admit that better 
guitarists have come along in

LA Ghetto Accumulating Capital via-Gov't 
Continued from page 2 
matter to court. 

The unique dual operation, 
with a heavy emphasis on 
financial operations rather 
than social services, is a 
legacy of former TELACU 
Industries director Leonard 
Rutkin. TELACU began as a 
"community union" in 1968, 
orga nized with Ford 
Foundation and United Auto 
Workers money following the 
ghetto riots in Newark, Detroit 
and Watts . At first it was just 
one " pacification" agency 
among many, fighting rival 
groups with one arm and 
barrio youth gangs with the 
other. 

The first economic 
development director, 
Escarcega says, was a 
"chemistry professor - all he 

could do was turn money mto 
shit." 

Rutkin joined TELACU as 
a consultant in 1974. He 
believed the key to developing 
the local economy was 
attracting and trapping capital 
in the barrio. He planned one 
major economic development 
each year, beginning with a 
Minority Enterprise Small 
Business Investment Corpora. 
tion in 1975, and the 
TELACU Community Thrift 
and Loan in 1976. TELACU 
is still the only CDC to operate 
a thrift & loan, or emphasize 
financ ial institutions so 
strongly. 

"We invest to become an 
equity partner ," Rutkin said at 
the time. "Our businesses may 
occasionally lose income, but 
we must never lose capital." 

The respect TELCAU 
commands among other 
community organizations did 
not come easily. It has been 
through the wars, surviving 
feuding gangs, hostile and 
jealous "welfare hustlers," and 
even r. period when one of its 
community organizers shot 
another. 

In 1974, TELACU spear-
headed a drive to incorporate 
East Los Angeles . Winning 
only 2,000 votes, it was easily 
defeated in a community 

where few residents register 
and fewer still are willing to 
vote for a measure that might 
bring higher taxes. TELACU 
has lasted to enjoy its tenth 
anniversary, but at the cost of 
some of its youthful idealism. 

The new industrial park is a 
case in point. "Only 15-18 
percent of the construction for 
the industrial park will be by 
minority contractors," 
Lizarraga admits. "They 
weren' t the low bidders. In 

fact , some tacked on 10-20 
percent to their bids lust 
becausE!' we were TELACU, 
and it was federal money. 

"We think the big thing _is 
creating 2,000 permanent 
jobs in the community - not 
helping a few minority 
contractors get a piece of the 
action. 

"We can't have a minority 
industrial park, but a minority-
owned industrial park."

Tickets to the concert cost 
$3 for general admission and 
$2 for students. Tickets are 
available at the UCSD Central 
Box Office, 452-4559. 

S. Balachander, acclaimed 
as India's foremost veena 

Balanchander is credited 
with popularizing the veena, 
an instrument which before 
had been used only in chamber 
recitals for an exclusive group 
of listeners. 

developed his own style and 
has toured extensively with the 
intrument, winning honors 
throughout India. He has 
made several records and has 
given concerts in Europe, the 
Middle-East and Far-East and 
Canada. 

The concert is sponsored by 
the India Club of UCSD and 
the India Aasociation of San 
Diego. Continued (rom page 4 

Unable to comply with 
some FCC rules, the station 
has "illegally" attempted on-
campus transmitting, he says. 
" This, combined with 
equipment malfunctions, 
caused the signal to go on and 
off sporadically," Rockwell 
says. 

Equipment difficulties have 
included setting up a cable 
transmission system, which 
took over a year "just to work 
out the bugs," according to 
Elisberg. 

But despite such troubles 
and anticipated difficulties in 
transmitting on campus, 
several KSDT members say 
they hope to expand to 
another cable and eventually 
to transmit via satellite.

to the University of California 
Radio Network , which 
currently connects several UC 
campus radio stations, which 
share common programming, 
according to Rockwell . 

Alsop Gets on Reviewer's Nerves 

The station also plans 
eventually to solicit 
approximately $250,000 for 
an educational FM license, 
Rockwell says. KSDT 
currently airs progressive 
rock , jazz and new wave. 

With such intentions, 
KSDT "is possibly just one big 
social club using valuable 
office space a nd costing the 
university a great deal of 
money," one UCSD adminis-
trator, who asked to remain 
unnamed, says .

stoned out of my mind, and 
still believing we could have 
world peace through the right 
mixture of drugs and 
indiscriminate sex, I would 
think that folkie Peter Alsop . 
was a totally bitchen guy. But 
this is 1980, and though my 
politics haven ', changed all 
that much, I think most of us 
learned the lesson that the 
world won' t be a better place 
through wishful thinking and 
pamphlet politics. Alsop , 
though, seems to exist quite 
happily in an airless vaccum .

"topical" songwriter, and 
though the things he chooses 
to sing about - the inate 
greed principal of capitalism, 
the horrors of nuclear energy, . 
labor songs, feminisms' 
liberation of males from the 
breadwinner role - you find 
him to be so politically 
"correct" that you'd like to 
punch him out. 

Not that I find anything 
particularly disagreeable with 
Alsop's world view. Rather, 
Alsop gets on my nerves 
because of his expression, 
which is didacticly self -
ri ghteou s, s ha llow and 

humorous to only an audience 
of like-minded politicol who 
already know the punchlines. 
And as a propagandist, he 
lacks the needed ability to swn 
up with the stirring turn of 
phrase . This man is not Phil 
Ochs, not Dylan, not Dave 
Van Ronk, not Buffy St. 
Marie. He is Peter Alsop, an 
insufferable little snit, a 
profoundingly depressing 
experience. What else can you 
expect from a man who 
probably won't play in any 
state that hasn't ratified the

Recendy developed 
laboratory techniques 
have found nitrosamines-
suspected cancer-causing 
agents-in some beers 
in minute amounts. 

There are no detectable 
nitrosamines in Coors or 
Coors Light as determined by 
the United States Food and 
Drug Administration, using 
the most sophisticated ana .. 
lytic techniques. 

Here's why: Some years ago, 
as part of a continuing effort 
to make the best beer possible, 
we instituted an unconven .. 
tional malting process. This 
special process not only creates 
a better beer, it avoids the possi .. 
bility of nitrosamines. 

Coors has a tradition of 
bringing innovative methods 
to the brewing of beer. Always 
attempting to brew a better, 
finer, purer beer. Once more, 
Coors' dedication to brewing 
excellence has paid off.
