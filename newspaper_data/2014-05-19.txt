VOLUME 47, ISSUE 55                MONDAY, MAY 19, 2014 WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

A plan to connect the Metropolitan Transit 
System’s trolley network to UCSD has stalled after the 
discovery of vernal pools containing an endangered 
species of shrimp along the planned route.

San Diego Association of Governments’ plan to 
build several MTS Blue Line light rail train stations 
on campus, as part of the SANDAG Mid-Coast 
Corridor Transit Project, is currently in a period of 
environmental planning and surveying. The planned 
11-mile light rail extension from Old Town to La Jolla 
is currently routed to inadvertently cross through 
several regional vernal pools that house a tiny species 
of “fairy” shrimp.

Branchinecta sandiegonensis, also known as the 
San Diego fairy shrimp, is a federally listed endangered 
and protected species of. Fairy shrimp generally vary 
from eight to 16 millimeters in length and are mostly 
native to San Diego and Baja California.

However, UCSD Director of Physical & 
Community Planning Robert Clossin said that there 
are no known vernal pools on the La Jolla campus 
that house fairy shrimp.

“The shrimp should not have any impact on the 
UCSD portion of the project,” Clossin said. “We’re 
excited to see the trolley on campus, and we’d prefer 
sooner rather than later.”

SANDAG’s board of directors discussed the 
discovery of the fairy shrimp at its May 9 meeting. 
Officials announced that an expected finalization for 
the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement 
and Subsequent Environmental Impact Report — 
both of which include references to the fairy shrimp 
— will take place later this year.

“The fairy shrimp could cause a one to four month 
processing delay for the environmental reports,” 
SANDAG Senior Public Information Officer David 
Hicks said. “However, signs are good that the delay 
will be shorter than that.”

Hicks said that SANDAG is in the process of 
securing funding under the federal Full Funding 

A Revelle College student living 
in the Village East Tower died 
shortly after Sun God Festival 2014, 
according to UCSD students who 
wished to remain anonymous. 

The mulitple sources confirmed 
to the UCSD Guardian that the 
student died while sleeping in the 
Village sometime after midnight on 
Saturday, May 17. An NBC 7 article 
posted Sunday afternoon put the 
time of death at around 2:30 a.m.

The source did not know if the 
student attended Sun God Festival.

The UCSD administration and 
the UCSD Police Department had 
not released any public information 
regarding the death as of press 
time, and representatives from 
A.S. Concerts and Events and the 
UCSD Police Department declined 
to comment.

An email sent out by a Residence 
Life staff member, whose name 
was signed as “Pat,” notified some 
residential advisors, including those 
in Earl Warren College, of the death. 

According to one of the sources, 
the email was later removed from 
the listserv.

A.S.  COUNCIL 

Endangered Shrimp May Delay Trolley
The Mid-Coast Corridor Transit Project has been stalled due to vernal pools along route.

Nine new Associate Vice Presidents 
were nominated and confirmed at the 
A.S Council meeting on May 14.

Due to current AVP College Affairs 
Meena Kaushik’s objection on the 
interview process, Charlie Cryan, the 
candidate nominated for AVP College 
Affairs, was not confirmed.

According to A.S. Council bylaws, 
the committee who conducts the 

interviews requires four senators to 
be present, and one of them must be 
a college senator to ensure that there’s 
input from the colleges. However,

non-allergic volunteers. You must have lived in Japan for at least 5 
years. The focus of this research study is to learn how seasonal 

pollens from Japan induce allergies. We hope to better understand 
how the immune system causes allergies and why non-allergic 

people don’t get sick.

If eligible, generally in good health, 18-65 years of age, and have 
lived in Japan for at least 5 years, you will be asked to provide a 
blood donation (similar to what is provided at a blood bank). You 

will be compensated $100 for your time and trouble.

Bioscholar Students Help Design New Upper Division Seminar

UCSD’s biology department and 
its Bioscholars Program launched an 
upper-division seminar, “BISP 170: 
From Bench to Bedside and Beyond,” 
beginning Spring Quarter 2014.

Bioscholars Program members 
collaborating with faculty advisor 
Dr. Kathleen French and Dr. Krista 
Todd founded BISP 170, officially 
“The Bioscholars Seminar,” in Winter 
Quarter 2013. It originally began as a 
series of interdisciplinary presentations 
about personalized medicine for the 
Bioscholars. Now in its second year 
running, BISP 170 was made an official 

class open to all students starting this 
quarter. French and Todd handle 
session logistics and final grading, 
while the Bioscholars introduce guest 
speakers who give detailed talks related 
to specific, contemporary topics in 
biology, the current theme entitled 
“From Bench to Bedside and Beyond.” 
The department collectively selected 
the guest lecturers based on the scope 
and innovation of their research.

This quarter, the students focused 
on the Obama administration’s 
Brain Research through Advancing 
Innovating Neurotechnologies 
Initiative. UCSD researchers, along 
with scientists from institutes across 
the country, have been contributing to 
the project since early 2013. 

In accordance with the theme, 
students learn about the basics of the 
BRAIN Initiative lab work, eventually 
moving on to its real-life, clinical 
applications and other implications.

Bioscholars president-elect Billy 
Nguyen told the UCSD Guardian that 
program members were the first to 
enroll, although other students later 
did join out of personal interest. The 
class size is capped at 20. So far, the 
seminar has been running smoothly.

“All the faculty treat it not as a 
lecture — we’ve tried to break down 
that wall — and more as a discussion 
between students and presenters,” 
Nguyen said. “We’ve fostered a lot of 
dialogue between the speakers.”

Nguyen, who helped organize the 

pilot seminar curriculum with outgoing 
Bioscholars President Chiara Ricci-
Tam and the rest of the Bioscholars 
Steering Committee, hopes that other 
program participants will eventually 
become more involved with creating 
similar seminars. This way, a broader 
reach of scholars will gain valuable 
experience in devising and teaching 
courses to fellow students. 

“It’s made for students by 
students, and that’s the biggest thing 
for us,” Nguyen said. “In how many 
other schools can you say that ‘I, as 
an undergrad, made this class for 
the community’?”

BY  an d rew  h uang    
Senior Staff Wrter

The seminar focuses on contemporary topics such as the BRAIN initiative, mental disorders and neurobiology ethics.

committee only included a college 
senator in the appointment process 
but not the interview process. 

“I think it’s very important, 
especially for this position, that there 
was college input and that a college 
senator was involved for the entire 
process and not just at the end,” 
Kaushik said.

According to A.S. President Robby 
Boparai, Council did not notice that 
the mistake was made. He attributed 
the error to the “disorganization” of 
the standing rules caused by changes 
made by the previous Council.

Kaushik said that she will ensure 
that all the logistics are in place for the 
chosen candidate in the fall.

AVP Student Services Bijan 
Mehryar believes that council members 
share the ability and commitment 
to enhance the students’ experience. 

Mehryar thinks that as long as A.S. 
Council maintains that perspective, it 
will have the capacity to enhance the 
student body’s experience.

AVP Environmental Justice Affairs 
Sierra Donaldson said that the council 
members will work cooperatively if 
they want to be productive.

“I think as long as everybody sticks 
to their same core beliefs, it doesn’t 
matter how Council feels about each 
other as long as they’re debating [the 
issues] and getting things done,” 
Donaldson said.

Donaldson also said that she is 
concerned about the lack of diversity 
within the group of students appointed 
to AVP positions. 

“The only concerning trend that I 
see as a progressive person is that so far 
there’s only one woman — me — and 
only one person of color,” Donaldson 
said. “As long as Council has a diverse 
mindset, it will be fine; I’m going to 

stay open-minded.”
Additional new appointees are 

Austin Peters for AVP Enterprise 
Operations, Tristan Britt for AVP 
Student Organizations, Lewis Simon 
for director of Triton Spirit and 
Athletics, Daniel Firoozi for AVP 
Local Affairs, Ryan Huyler for AVP 
Student Advocacy and Seraphin Raya 
for AVP Concerts and Events. 

Donaldson, Britt and Raya were all 
candidates with the Let’s Act! slate, the 
opposing slate to Tritons Forward — 
which currently holds all presidential, 
vice presidential and campuswide 
senator and academic senator 
positions — in the Spring Quarter 
2014 Week 2 elections. Additionally, 
Let’s Act! presidential candidate 
Kyle Heiskala was re-appointed as 
ASUCSD MOVES Director.

Grant Agreement for up to half of the 
Mid-Coast Corridor Transit Project 
construction costs. The fairy shrimp 
discovery could delay the federal 
approval of the environmental impact 
report, which could cause SANDAG 
to miss the February 2015 deadline 
to apply for federal project funding. 
This could postpone construction on 
the extension until 2019.

In June 2013, a spokesman for 
SANDAG told the UCSD Guardian 
that officials expected construction 
to be completed by 2018. SANDAG’s 
current estimate, according to Hicks, 
is that the trolley extension will be 
operational either at the end of 2018 
or the beginning of 2019. 

“When they start saying either late 
one year or early the next year, we 

usually accept the later date as more 
accurate,” Hicks said.

Clossin said that other campus 
development plans, such as a new 
baseball stadium, may benefit from 
the trolley’s arrival on campus. Last 
month, UCSD Athletics announced 
plans for a large renovation to the 
East Campus Triton Ballpark — 
which is near one of SANDAG’s 
planned trolley stations for the Blue 
Line extension on East Campus.

“We have good collaboration with 
other departments’ projects and other 
campus projects have been informed 
by the trolley plans,” Clossin said. 
“A station near the [new] baseball 
stadium would be a good thing.”

Senior Associate Athletic Director 
Ken Grosse said that it is too early to 
determine the stadium renovation’s 
impact on the trolley extension.

“Obviously, the trolley line is going 
to go outside the outfield fence,” Grosse 
said. “We haven’t yet gotten to a point 
where we can recognize the overall 
effect that the ballpark plan will have.”

With the prospect of student-
trolley ridership on campus beginning 
in several years, UCSD students will 
vote on a fee increase that would fund 
unlimited ridership on MTS buses and 
trains next week. Clossin said his office 
didn’t have any direct interests in the 
transportation referendum but that his 
office “is on board” with more students 
utilizing public transit.

“From a planning perspective, 
we’re excited about new campus 
developments with alternate 
transportation,” he said.

Sixty Years 
Later, and 
Segregation 
Still Exists

The landmark case Brown v. Board of Education turned 60 last weekend, but a new study 
published at UCLA shows that there’s 
no reason to celebrate, as de facto seg-
regation in education is growing pro-
gressively worse. The study analyzed 
the segregation landscape of school 
districts over a period of time in 
America and found that racial isola-
tion has been steadily increasing over 
the past quarter century, especially 
for Latinos. A commemoration of the 
Brown v. Board decision becomes bit-
terly ironic because the clause “sepa-
rate is inherently unequal” has fallen 
on deaf ears, with little to no federal 
efforts to solve the problem. Racial 
integration has failed in its implemen-
tation nationwide.

The desegregation process was 
productive throughout the late 1980s 
until the Supreme Court began adopt-
ing conservative policies that reflected 
skepticism and even hostility toward 
desegregation programs. The post-
1980s Supreme Court believed that 
courts should have a limited social 
role and prioritized local control 
over court control in the operation 
of schools. They ruled that court-
ordered desegregation decrees, such 
as mandatory busing programs, could 
end before reaching their statisti-
cal goals for racial integration and 
desegregation plans were terminated 
en masse. Without federal leadership, 
school districts lacked the incentive 
to racially integrate, and local schools 
simply abandoned desegregation as a 
priority. The vestiges of institutional 
racism remained and began to grow.

Now, we are seeing the conse-
quences of the failed effort to imple-
ment the goals established by Brown 
v. Board. The study by Orfield et al at 
UCLA found that California is one of 
the top three worst states for racially 
isolating black students, as well as the 
state in which Latino students are the 
most segregated. In San Diego, black 
and Latino exposure to white students 
has decreased by almost 10 percent in 
the last decade. Without desegregation 
efforts, schools and housing continue 
to be racially and socioeconomically 
isolated, resulting in less qualified 
teachers, less successful peer groups 
and inadequate teaching facilities and 
materials for disadvantaged groups.

The number of unqualified 
teachers is 6.75 times higher in high-
minority schools than in low-minority 
schools, according to a research study 
by Darling-Hammond in 2001. In a 
segregated system, disadvantaged chil-
dren are isolated from middle class 
students and continue to be over-
whelmed by an oppressive structure 
that they did not create and cannot 
completely overcome by themselves.

A key insight in this study is 
that no single community can solve 
a problem that reaches beyond its 
boundary lines. Segregation is not 
contained within individual districts 
but extends between districts, lead-
ing local authority to be inadequate 
in addressing the issue. There is 
currently no basis in federal law for 
cross-district cooperation in diversity 
plans. Concerted efforts are necessary 
to dismantle segregation and should 
be reflected in federal policies that 
provide incentive for diversity efforts. 
Education enables social mobility, and 
awareness of this fact as well as of the 
worsening climate of segregation is 
necessary to apply the vision set forth 
in Brown v. Board.

NICO  HEMSLEY  NAHEMSLEY@ucsd.eduJUSTICE   IS   SERVED

UCSD Transportation and Parking Services may be broken, but it is now up to students to make the right choice and help each other get to school affordably. We endorse voting yes in this week’s transportation 
referendum for the students’ best interests.

The plan proposed in the referendum is by far the cheapest way to 
ensure that all students, both undergraduates and graduates, continue to 
have affordable access to mass transportation. Ideally, providing more on-
campus housing would reduce the number of students that rely on mass 
transit, but dorms and apartments at UCSD are already far too crowded. 
With that said, we must find a solution that can accommodate commuters 
who are operating on a tight budget. Without the referendum, thousands 
of students who rely on the bus every day will struggle to find an afford-

able way to get to campus. From this perspective, the referendum is hardly 
discretionary; getting to and from campus should never be a barrier that 
prevents students from receiving their education. 

The referendum is based directly on preferences that were indicated 
by survey data; it was written by the students, for the students. Therefore, 
this benefits an overwhelming amount of the UCSD population. If the 
referendum is not passed, students who use the bus on a daily basis will 
be required to fork over roughly $72 per month; this is simply unfeasible 
for those who have to pay for their own tuition or struggle with other 
bills. The referendum, on the other hand, only requires students to pay 
about $50 per quarter, which translates to a much more reasonable $16 per 
month. This subsidized fee is an incredible four times less than the stan-

VOTE YES FOR TRANSPORTATION

Passing the upcoming referendum would provide an affordable, long-term solution for getting students to 
campus, while subsidizing access to more San Diego bus and trolley routes.

QUICK  TAKES WITH THE MEDIA’S FOCUS ON THE RECENT BOTCHED EXECUTIONS IN THE NEWS, SOME JOURNALISTS HAVE PROPOSED MAKING THE PROCESS PUBLICLY VIEWABLE TO MAKE AUDIENCES REASSESS THE MORALITY OF THE DEATH PENALTY.

According to the Death Penalty Information 
Center, the United States has executed 1,379 people 
since 1976. It is the only country in the West that 
still executes prisoners. Citizens of the United States 
have voted in favor of execution but don’t seem to 
clearly understand what that means for the justice 
system. Televising executions and making them 
publicly viewable or choosing a method that seems 
less like a routine medical procedure than lethal 
injection would force the citizens to see exactly 
what goes into taking a life. 

The death penalty is something that a major-
ity of the citizens of the United States have agreed 
should exist, but very few civilians besides the fami-
lies of criminal victims and the media have ever 
actually seen what happens when someone is killed 
in the name of the law. Trial consultant Richard 
Gabriel says that a technique like the lethal injec-
tion “simply gives us greater psychological distance 
from killing another human being.” 

United States citizens have to be willing to 
admit that when they vote to have the death pen-
alty, they are “codifying revenge,” according to 
Gabriel. Televising executions would trigger emo-
tions in people in a way that newspaper headlines 
simply can’t. People must have the opportunity to 
view the consequences of their votes and be able 
to live with the ramifications of taking a life. If 
broadcasting executions and making them more 
clearly murderous than a privately administered 
injection is what it takes, then campaigning for 
such changes should be the next step for propo-
nents and opponents of execution alike.

victed Oklahoma City terrorist Timothy McVeigh, 
some argue that televising the procedure may 
influence the public to demand more humane 
executions. However, arguing for “cleaner” execu-
tions is really the public’s way of trying to clear its 
collective conscience.

Today, the most common method of execution 
in the U.S. is lethal injection. This involves admin-
istering drugs to the criminal in hopes of making 
his or her passing as quick and painless as pos-
sible. Lethal injection was seen as a more humane 
way of killing convicts because it did not create 
a bloody mess. However, as recent executions in 
Oklahoma illustrate, this method is not as smooth 
as was first thought and instead can leave victims 
writhing and convulsing.

As further evidence, one can look back to 
the French Revolution, when the guillotine was 
the method of choice for executions. Like lethal 
injection, the guillotine was classified as humane 
because it was thought to be less painful. But the 
duration of pain does not mitigate the inherent 
brutality of such a killing.

No matter how we choose to kill our criminals 
today, no method will truly ever be quick and 
painless. Demanding more humane executions is 
society’s attempt to alleviate the guilt for having col-
lectively sentenced someone to death. Citizens don’t 
want to feel the blood on their hands and thus cry 
for a “humane” killing. But their concern has noth-
ing to do with caring for our society’s criminals and 
everything to do with our guilty consciences.

In a guest commentary for CNN, trial consul-
tant Richard Gabriel argues that public, televised 
executions would persuade audiences to re-evaluate 
the death penalty because it would allow them 
to see the accused as a real human. While it is 
definitely important to question the validity of the 
death penalty, allowing the public to view a sensi-
tive and private event does not help anyone.

Most notably, public viewership of an execution 
could possibly violate the Eighth Amendment’s 
“cruel and unusual punishment” clause. It is inhu-
mane and disrespectful to allow the public to watch 
someone die, even if he or she is a convicted crimi-
nal. Furthermore, publicized executions will turn 
the death penalty into some sort of depraved form 
of entertainment akin to the days when spectators 
would watch executions in the Roman Colosseum. 

According to an ABC News article, Eastern 
Michigan University professor and death penalty 
expert Paul Leighton describes public executions 
as “prurient,” or being an unhealthy interest. With 
so much other graphic content on TV nowadays, 
the brutality of real-life televised executions might 
even be psychologically harmful for viewers. Helen 
Prejean, an anti-death penalty advocate, claims that 
although the death penalty intends to bring relief to 
victims’ families, many have said that watching the 
perpetrator die does not offer closure for them. 

Several experts, including Leighton, agree that 
having the public view executions will not serve a 
legitimate purpose. Ultimately, it is tasteless to glo-
rify and dramatize the death penalty by publicizing 
what is a sensitive and serious issue.

dard rate, which commuters would have to 
pay if the referendum fails. The referendum 
also stands to benefit students receiving 
scholarships and aid, as 29 percent of the 
transportation fees are mandated to go to 
UCSD’s financial aid fund.

The Regional Transit Pass — a direct 
result of the referendum’s passage — will 
provide students with expanded access to 
different modes of transportation through-
out San Diego. It guarantees students unlim-
ited ridership on the trolley, light rail routes 
and all mass transit buses, expanding access 
to every corner of the San Diego area. In 
effect, students would actually be given bet-
ter services for a quarter of the price. This 
would open more convenient and cost-effi-
cient travel possibilities for getting around 

various parts of San Diego, as well as enable 
students to explore the city more easily.

 For students who do not use the bus 
system very frequently, the transportation 
referendum may seem like an unnecessary 
financial burden. However, it is important 
to realize that transportation is just one of 
the many services that all students pay for 
but do not always utilize. We may not all use 
RIMAC, participate in student organizations 
and athletics or attend the Sun God Festival, 
but these and many other valuable and pop-
ular student resources are always available to 
us if we choose to use them, which most do. 

If we don’t pass the referendum, there 
will not only be cuts to shuttle services, 
but more students may choose to drive to 
campus, thus making parking lots and other 
areas surrounding UCSD far more crowded. 
With over 10,000 commuter students who 

currently rely on the bus system to get to 
and from campus, it is critical to pass a 
referendum that serves that constituency. 
While student concerns about the introduc-
tion of yet another expense are completely 
understandable, it is important to keep in 
mind that the proposed, modest fee increase 
is only a small burden in comparison to the 
lingering issues that would arise if the refer-
endum fails. 

In order for the referendum to have 
a chance of passing, there needs to be a 
20-percent voter turnout, so make sure to 
get to the polls. Whether you support or 
oppose the referendum, it is just as impor-
tant to cast a vote and participate in the 
process. At the end of the day, students will 
be the ones that are affected by this mandate, 
whether a $50 quarterly fee is implemented 
or all transportation services are lost.

FACT CHECK:

STATEMENT: 
“A ‘yes’ vote ensures 
preservation of Arriba/Nobel 
City Shuttle services for the 
next five years.”

STATEMENT: 
“A ‘yes’ vote ensures estab-
lishment of student oversight 
— no changes without our 
consent.”

STATEMENT: 
“When using MTS services, 
students will either pay per 
ride [or] have to purchase 
individual passes ranging 
around $100 per quarter!”

STATEMENT: 
“Without a bus program, more 
students will drive to campus 
— parking lots will be more 
crowded.”

Never does the actual referendum language mention the Arriba/Nobel shuttle service 
or ensure its specific existence for the next five years. The referendum says that “UCSD 
Transportation Services will operate a city shuttle program,” but that is the closest thing 
the referendum offers to suggest the continuation of the Arriba/Nobel shuttle service. The 
language is vague toward UCSD Transportation Services and does not hold TPS to anything 
concrete regarding actual shuttle lines, suggesting they may still cut certain stops or change 
the line altogether. Furthermore, the only revenue the referendum allocates to the continu-
ation of the shuttle service is what is left over from what was used for the Regional Transit 
Pass. The Student Transportation Advisory Committee may use the revenue to keep Arriba/
Nobel in service, but the committee also ultimately may decide it is more cost-effective and 
beneficial to cut or change Arriba/Nobel. If so, there is nothing in the transportation refer-
endum preventing them from making such a decision.

In regard to the extent of student control over these proposed fees, the trans-
portation referendum proposes the establishment of a new Student Transportation 
Advisory Committee. STAC will be composed of a student chair and at least 80-per-
cent student votership. Though 100 percent of the fee revenue is already allocated to 
the acquisition of a transit pass and financial aid for need-based students, STAC will 
have the power to decide how to use any revenue left over from the purchase of the 
transit pass if such revenue exists. In addition, according to the referendum, TPS will 
merely administer these fees with no actual power to decide where they go, and the 
referendum explicitly states that the fee cannot be used to pay university employees. 
With this design, the students on STAC will decide how to spend the money generated 
by the student transportation fee.

The referendum’s proposed $49.96 fee indeed is about half the price of a Metropolitan  
Transit System bus pass per quarter. Currently, the rate MTS charges is $31 per month for 
UCSD students, translating to a $93 fee for a given quarter. If the referendum fails, transit 
users will either have to pay this higher monthly fee or pay per ride. In the case that one pays 
per ride, the urban and local bus route fare is $2.25 per ride. Thus, the proposed fee translates 
to 22 one-way rides if paid per ride, which could get someone to Ralphs and back 11 times 
in a ten-week quarter. For those who use the bus system sparingly — less than 11 times — 
paying per ride could be more cost-efficient. On the other hand, the referendum provides 
a good deal for frequent commuters who plan to use the MTS system several times a week.

An unsubsidized MTS regional adult monthly pass is $72 which translates to $648 for 
nine months, while an S parking permit for nine months is currently $549 and is expected 
to increase. With additional vehicular expenses such as gas, car insurance and maintenance, 
an unsubsidized regional pass may still be more fiscally beneficial than bringing a car to 
campus. Parking rates may also go up regardless of the referendum, as TPS is currently $3 
million in debt. This is in line with the parking rate increase that TPS proposed last year, 
which can be found on moveucsandiego.ucsd.edu. TPS said that the proposed 15-percent 
increase in the cost of A permits and 10-percent increase in the cost of B and S permits 
were to help deal with last year’s $2.2 million budget deficit problem, and since that debt has 
increased, students may expect an increase in parking rates, as well. Furthermore, TPS does 
offer alternatives to commute by car, such as Carpool, Vanpool, Coaster Club, Pedal Club, 
Zimride access and campus shuttles that remain unaffected by the transportation referen-
dum. Therefore, this statement appears to be a speculation due to the many complicating 
factors in how parking may be affected with the new changes that the referendum proposes.

FACT CHECK: TRANSPORTATION REFERENDUM

STATEMENT: 
“[Student fee] is going to the 
City of San Diego Metropolitan 
Transit System.” 

STATEMENT: 
“Students will have no con-
trol and will have no idea on 
how their money will be used 
at MTS.”

STATEMENT: 
“Every five years, there will 
be a new referendum with a 
higher fee for the same ser-
vices.”

FALSE 

DETERMINATION: MISLEADING

DETERMINATION: FALSE

DETERMINATION: FALSE

The referendum language states that Metropolitan Transit System would only receive 
a portion of the money raised by the fees and also stresses that the money raised goes to 
students, as well. According to the referendum, 71 percent of the fees is going to MTS to 
pay for the quarterly passes for students. The money going to MTS allows students to obtain 
Regional Transit Passes that allow students unlimited access to any MTS or North County 
Transit District bus, trolley or light rail routes for a quarter (excluding rural and premium 
express routes). The rest of the funds will go to supporting students who have to pay the fee. 
Twenty-nine percent of the raised money will go to the Financial Aid Office to provide aid 
to students based on financial need, as the proposed transportation fee would be included 
in financial aid determination. Therefore, this statement is misleading as it implies that all 
of the funds raised by the fees will go to MTS, which is not the case. Furthermore, the funds 
that do go to MTS will be used solely for the Regional Transit Pass.

The referendum clearly states what will be done with the money raised from the student 
fees if the referendum passes. At a basic level, the referendum is transparent in specifying that 
students who pay the new, mandatory fee will receive the Regional Transit Pass. After the 29 
percent that goes to financial aid is factored in, the referendum specifies that any remaining 
money not used to provide the Transit Pass will go to the Student Transportation Advisory 
Committee to develop and promote alternative transportation methods and not to MTS. 
The referendum states that STAC’s role is to increase the safety and sustainability of methods 
such as bicycling, bike sharing, carpooling, car sharing, skateboarding and walking. The 
STAC would also be responsible for making Transportation Services’ annual budget reports 
available to the public to increase transparency about how the raised money is being used.

Though the writer of this con statement refers to UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside and 
UC Berkeley as comparisons in the trend of increasing transportation fees, the most cru-
cial part of this statement is the actual vote on whether to increase the fee proposed in the 
referendum, which the writer conveniently leaves out. The proposed fee in the referen-
dum cannot simply increase on its own without the student body’s consent via a majority 
vote. After the referendum expires in spring 2019, students will vote again on whether to 
change it or keep it at all, and the student body will not necessarily vote to increase the 
fee. They may vote to keep it the same price or may even vote not to bring back the refer-
endum at all. The only way the fee will increase without a doubt will be through inflation, 
which affects tuition every year anyway, and which the referendum clearly outlines as 1.5 
percent every quarter beginning in Fall Quarter 2015, or roughly 50 cents per quarter.

Junior right-handed pitcher Dan 
Kolodin earned the win and allowed 
six hits in six innings.

UCSD entered Sunday afternoon’s 
contest against Chico with one loss 
in the double-elimination tourna-
ment. The Tritons would have to beat 
the lossless Wildcats in back-to-back 
games on Sunday in order to win 
Regionals and advance to the NCAA 
Division II Championship. 

However, Chico only needed the 
one game to end the tournament, as 
UCSD was eliminated 3–1 on Sunday 
in a nerve-racking, low-scoring affair 
that stretched for over three hours. 
With the game tied at one apiece going 
into the seventh, UCSD fell victim to 
a major infield error that ultimate-
ly allowed Chico to take a 3–1 lead. 
UCSD willed itself out of several tough 
situations in the final innings, only to 
have its last runner thrown out at first 
in the bottom of the ninth frame to 
conclude an incredible 2014 season.

“I thought our guys gutted it up, big 
time,” UCSD head coach Eric Newman 
said. “We had a plan and we stuck to it 
and got some pretty heroic efforts out 
there. We had a lot of opportunities 
that we just weren’t able to come up 
with the two-out hit.”

Seven seniors concluded their col-

legiate careers on Sunday. 
“It’s been an extraordinary expe-

rience,” La Face said. “I’ve been so 
blessed and fortunate to be around 
such a great coaching staff that did a 
phenomenal job of preparing us.” 

Despite the disappointing end, the 
Tritons expressed pride in a strong 
2014 campaign full of big moments. 

“The very first day, I challenged 
them to outwork each other, to be a 

team, and they did,” Newman said. “I 
have to credit Nick [La Face] and the 
seniors for their leadership because 
they were phenomenal. We learned a 
lot about each other, and the respect 
and pride I have for this group, there 
are probably no words I could use to 
express that.”

for us … to try and win three singles 
instead of four.” 

With MSU up 2–1, the play shifted 
from doubles to singles, during which 
the Mustangs ran away with the win.

“We knew everything was going to 
be close on each court,” UCSD head 
coach Timmer Willing said. “We knew 
we had some advantages on some 
courts and some disadvantages on 
others, but it was just a physically gru-
eling match for each court involved.”

MSU won the first match, with 
Toyos beating UCSD’s sophomore Ga-
nesh Alagappan in two straight sets in 
the No. 3 slot. In the following match 
at No. 4, Luu faced MSU junior Jarrod 
Liston but came up short despite win-
ning the first set 6–2. Luu dropped the 
last two sets 6–4 and 6–1, giving MSU 
a 4–1 lead on the day.

The final vestiges of hope for the 
Tritons came at No. 5 as Porutiu tallied 
the Tritons’ only singles victory, after 
winning a grueling first set 7–6 and 

taking the second set 6–4 against Mus-
tang freshman Christopher Norrie. 

With UCSD down 4–2 and only 
two matches remaining, the Tritons 
failed to mount a comeback as the 
Mustangs clinched the victory as No. 
2 Herekar battled No. 43 sophomore 
Kyle Davidson, winning the first set 
6–4 but falling hard in the next two 
sets 6–4 and 6–1. 

No. 38 Jiganti played in the 
unfinished, final set at No. 1 as the 
Mustangs moved on to the next round 
of NCAA play.

While UCSD’s postseason was 
cut short, Wednesday’s competition 
marked the 13th time in 14 years 
that the Tritons have qualified for the 
national tournament. 

“This whole year our goal was to 
get back to nationals, and we accom-
plished that,” Luu said. “We practiced 
really hard for this, and we just gave it 
our best at nationals and we just hap-
pened to come up short.”

After suffering what he called 
“mental fatigue” toward the end of the 

year, Willing nevertheless reflected 
positively on what was still a strong 
2013–14 season.

“Overall, I’m very happy with the 
guys,” Willing said. “I was disap-
pointed we didn’t get that last win to 
get to play West Florida, who ended 
up winning the championship. That’s 
a little bit disappointing, but by no 
means am I disappointed in how our 
team did this year.” 

While their season has only just 
ended, the Tritons have already begun 
making improvements for the upcom-
ing 2014–15 season. 

“We have a couple good recruits 
signed, [along with one], maybe 
two, transfers, and then we’re 
returning six starters from this na-
tional team,” Willing said. “The field 
is going to be much deeper next 
year, so it’s going to be a little more 
difficult, but I think our team each 
year is going to get better.”

HOUSING
I need housing for school year - $800 
- Hello, I will be a new UCSD EE gradu-
ate student starting this September, 2014. 
Therefore I’ll be needing a place to stay for 
2 (possibly 3) years. I’m looking for a room/ 
studio around $500/month (unlikely), that 
is ideally less than 5 miles from campus, 
and do not need to share a room (bath-
room is ok); however, this is only the dream 
I am very flexible. If super necessary I can 
move in around mid August. Some details 
about myself: - Non-smoker - Extremely 
neat & organized - Cat allergies (I do not 
own any pets) If you need any informa-
tion from me please do not hesitate to 
ask! Thank you, -Christopher cligocki@eng.

decade of the War on Terror in the Little Pakistan of Brooklyn, ethnographic 
examples come from a range of chapter topics including activism, policing, 
health care, and legal issues, that detail the unlikely possibilities in the gray areas

BASEBALL

After nearly a month-long hiatus, 
the No. 13 UCSD men’s tennis team 
headed to Sanlando Park outside of 
Orlando, Florida for the NCAA Divi-
sion II Championship Tournament 
last Wednesday, May 14 but failed to 
keep up against No. 17 Midwestern 
State University in a round-one tour-
nament exit. The Tritons (15–10 over-
all) could only take one match each in 
both singles and doubles against the 
19–6 overall Texas natives. 

The match between MSU started 
in the afternoon after a four-hour rain 
delay with the No. 1 and No. 2 doubles 
contests. UCSD’s freshman Alexandre 
Miaule and sophomore Horea Porutiu 

fell 8–2 in the No. 2 slot, but senior 
Max Jiganti and junior Kona Luu took 
the top-ranked match against No. 11 
nationally ranked junior Tomas Gre-
jtak and freshman Ramon Toyos.

After the first two doubles matches, 
both squads were tied at one match 
apiece. Entering into the No. 3 match, 
the Tritons gained momentum. Down 
7–5, UCSD’s pair of senior Rajeev 
Herekar and junior Mark Meyer dug 
in and tied the match up at 8–8. How-
ever, the tiebreaker slipped away from 
the Tritons, who ultimately lost 7–3.

“The turning point was in [that 
match],” Luu said. “If we won that 
match, we would have gone up 2–1, 
which would have made it a lot easier 

End of the Road

MEN'S TENNIS

First-Round NCAAs Loss 
Concludes UCSD’s Season
No. 13 tennis struggled against No. 17 Midwestern 
State, tallying only two wins in total last Wednesday. After a solid performance at the 

Stanford Invitational, the UCSD men’s 
crew team traveled to Sacramento, 
California this past Saturday for its fi-
nal, regular-season races at the Western 
Invitational where the Tritons recorded 
mixed results. The Freshman 8 and 
Varsity 8 had the best finishes at first 
and third, respectively. 

UCSD’s Varsity 8 came in third for 
its first race, finishing at 6 minutes, 
16.4 seconds, nine seconds behind first 
place Gonzaga University (6:07.2) and 
seven seconds behind crosstown op-
ponent University of San Diego. Santa 
Clara University rounded out the race, 
coming in at 6:45.9 for fourth place. 

For the second Varsity 8 race, 
UCSD again finished in third at 6:23.7, 
seven seconds slower than its first heat. 
USD and Gonzaga exchanged finishes 

this time around, as USD took first 
with a time of 6:13.9, just ahead of sec-
ond-place Gonzaga. The race conclud-
ed with Santa Clara coming in fourth 
with a time of 6:45.9.

The younger Triton crew squad 
showed promise, as it managed to fin-
ish in first for the Freshman 8 race, 
running away from the competition 
with a time of 6:19.2. USD crossed the 
finish line 10 seconds after the Tritons 
at 6:29.6, while Gonzaga came in 18 
seconds after UCSD at 6:37.9. 

With the regular season behind 

them, the Tritons now look toward the 
Intercollegiate Rowing Association Na-
tional Championships, which will take 
place in Princeton, New Jersey from 
May 30 to June 1. The UCSD men’s 
crew team is currently ranked sixth 
nationally in Division II. Nova South-
eastern University, along with fellow 
California Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion conference opponent Humboldt 
State, are tied at second.

The No. 15, number one seed UCSD baseball team hosted the 2014 NCAA Division II West Regionals this past Thursday, May 15 through Sunday, May 
18 at Triton Ballpark but lost in the championship match to 
second-seeded Chico State Wildcats. After going 3–2 in the 
tournament, the Tritons conclude their season with a 38–16 
overall record. 

UCSD won the West Region opener against Sonoma 
State 3–0 off of a clutch, 7.1-inning performance from 
junior southpaw Trevor Scott, who threw a season-high 
seven strikeouts.

“This was definitely my best performance as a Triton,” 
Scott said during the postgame press conference. “I was just 
trying to get us into the second round, set the tone for the 
tournament and make the best pitches I could.”

Redshirt freshman rightfielder Brandon Shirley batted in 
two of the Triton’s runs in the seventh on a first-pitch triple. 

An inning later, junior infielder Erik Lewis contributed the 
only other run to seal the game.

Game two against California State Polytechnic University 
Pomona saw senior outfielder Justin Rahn produce his best 
offensive outing in an already impressive year. Rahn man-
aged a whopping eight runs batted in and two home runs in 
five plate appearances to boost the Tritons to a 20–5 victory. 
The 20 total runs on 22 hits marked season highs on both 
counts with every Triton starter scoring at least once. Fellow 
seniors shortstop Garrett Tuck and catcher Nick La Face also 
had standout days at the plate, tallying seven RBI altogether 
while junior first baseman/outfielder Michael Mann went a 
perfect 5-for-5. Sophomore infielder/right-handed pitcher 
Troy Cruz made his 13th start on the hill for the Tritons and 
took the winning decision after five frames.

“Last night I kind of struggled with nerves, but today I 
decided to just put a good swing on it and do what I could,” 

Rahn told the UCSD Athletics Department. “When everyone 
buys into the game plan like we saw today, we’re a force to 
be reckoned with.”

On Saturday, the Tritons fell to Chico State 6–5 in their 
first loss of the tournament. The Wildcats took the first lead 
of the game with a three-run third inning before UCSD stole 
the advantage with three runs in the fourth and two runs in 
the sixth. However, in the bottom of the seventh, Chico plat-
ed a trio of runs to reclaim the lead. The 6–5 edge ultimately 
proved enough as the Wildcats automatically advanced to 
Sunday’s championship contest. 

UCSD took on No. 16 California Baptist University in 
the nightcap to determine who would join Chico for the title 
game. The Tritons came in the clutch, easily beating CBU 
14–5 to move on to a Sunday rematch against the Wildcats.
