Tales of horror from 
a UCSD coffee freak 

First, I need to make this 
ab olutely clear. Coffee is a 
perfect Iy vile, American and 
di gusting habit. At lea t, r 
said that until my Swedish 
friend told me that comparing 
American and European coffee 
is something like comparing 
beer and vodka. Anyway , 
coffee drinking is a vile and 
disgusting habit. 

Tea is a different matter. 
Not Lipton or the abomination 
111 the Muir Cafeteria, not 
herbal, strawberry, jasmine or 
granola tea , but Real Tea. 
Engli h Breakfast. Formosa 
Oolong, Earl Grey , Morning 
Thunder. Only two require' 
men ts are taste and caffeine. 

o I am sitting here, trying 
to procrastinate by reading the 
Guardian a nd drinking 
Twinings' English Breakfa~l. 
The FDA doesn ' t think 
caffeine is safe. [ could have 
told them that. but it does the 
job (of staying awake) better 
than cocaine. 

My caffeine·ingestion habit 
used to be something like thIs: 
a cup at breakfast, lunch and 
dinner. For final and 
midterms, double thedo e. For 
papers, increa e to a cup an 
hour. This i inconvenient : I 
need a cup and aucer (we 
couldn 't be so uncouth a to 
drink without a saucer, could 
we now?), boiling water , 
sugar, a spoon, and a place to 
sit for ten minUles to let the 
brew cool. Yes, ten minutes. 
Consumer Reports thinks my 
tea has 65 milligrams of 
caffeine in each cup. COl/sumer 
Repoyts thinks I brew my tea 
for four minutes. Think again 
Consumer Reports. 

However, all t his was 
changed by the discovery of 
(fanfare pleane) mocha beans 
and espresso beans. Mocha 
beans are tasty concocl ions of 
chocolate and coffee. I eat 
Ihem like chocolate ChIPS, in 
mass quantities. Delish. Then 
there's nasty espresso beans. 
They're chocolate·covered YaU' 
l'offeebeans.Again, eall hem by 
the handful. Think of 
swallowing No-Doz by the box, 
and you get the idea . When I 
study, I like to have somet hing 
to munch on as well as t h" 
essential caffeine. These little 
monsters combine both. Wow! 

So, back to the FDA. They 

The Bottom Line 

think it causes birth defects. 
Two·headed mutant s, anyone? 
Sorry, I've moved beyond thal. 
I\ e gone hardcore. No mere 
coffee or tea for me. I've moved 
beyond "coffee nerves" to the 
real thing - caffeinl' psychosis. 
(Coffee nerves is for people 
who can't handle their drugs.) 
I'm in the fast lane now, and 
it 's marked "watch out for 
falhng delusions." 

You've heard of ampheta·

schizophrenia, right? This i 
legal, The rll sh hit s after 
about ten beans, my face

delusions of Mlck Jagger float 
through my lust ful heild , I 
decide that finals are a 

communi~t plot. I type faster. I 
run around t he dorm 
"creaming about the mush· 
rooms at the bottom of mv 
houseplant, I gulp anolher cup 
of tea , pass out the drugs to 
everyone else, I've got the 
shakes but I'm not sure if It'S 
because of the rus h or the 
speed of my typing. I crank 
Genesis on the tereo but 
nobody complains because 
they know better than to 
Interrupt me, no this i not 
suppo 'ed to be a humor 
column, thi is the trulh , 
dammit , dreams of cultural 
imperialism and UNESCO and 
Mick (always Mlck) dance 
through t he sk ull like 
sugarplums and mocha beans, 
ran out of those two hours ago 
but I've still got the hardcore 
stuff , wonder if Earl Grey 
leads to heroin , conti nue at 
thiS pace and level of 
hallucination until I finish the 
paper at about six in the 
morning. It 's never been any 
other \\ay. 

The worst of I t IS that the 
FDA is qUlle right. Caffeine is 
an abomination. And wh ile 
I've got lime before finals , so 
why do I do it? I1 uh? No 
answer? Is college doing this? 
No, be realistIC. You're doing it 
to yourself, I have met my 
enemy. and it IS my urge for 
poison . Someda y, someday 
after law school (after all, 
that's why I'm doing it), I'll 
slow clown. But no time now. 
Cafferne pnychosis. anyone?

Letter to the Editor 

Exactly who did Jesus think 
he was? Another point of view 
Editor: 

I'm writ ing I his in reacl ion 
to the recent article, "Was 
Jesus Chris t really a ' straight 
a they say?" It came to my 
attention that Jesus has been 
gelting some bad press 
recentl y, and since He is a 
personal friend of mine I 
thought J oughl to s t ick up for 
him. The "bad press" I'm 
referring to I ~ the article 
wrilten by Bruce Macdonald 
in the Monda}" May 3rd 
edition of the Guardiall. I'll 
ignore M r. Macdonalcl 's 
comments on Jesus' "person· 
alitlY affl ictions" ( chizophre· 
nia and manic depression) and 
get to the meat of the issue. 

Mr. Macdonald argues that 
the Christian faith didn't start 

Jesus has been get-
ting ... bad press ... 
with Jesus, but rather was a 
fictional c reation of Paul and 
ot her ear ly believer s. 
Macdonald s tate s, "The 
Ch rist idea itself, for one: that 
whole idea of the Resurrection 
wasn't even inaugurated by 
Jesus. but by the visions of 
Mary Magdalene and some of 
the apost les. The idea of 
sacrificia l dea th, of redemp· 
tion of believer~ through that 
death, Ihe idea of Christ as 
second pt'rson of the Trinity-
these 'basics' of Christian it y 
rea lly ha ve nothing to do with 
Jesus. They ca me later." 
Exactly who did1esus think he 
was? IIow did he vIew his 
deat h? Was the Resurrection 
historica lly true? Do these 
basics of Christian ity really 
come from Jesus? J believe Ihey 
do. 

Let's examine who Jesus 
thought he was. InJohn 10:30· 
33 Jesus proclaims, " I and the 

Father are one." (The Greek 
meaning of the word is: of vne 
nature or es ence.) Jesus here 
claimed to be of the same 
nature or essence as God the 
Father. The Jews' response 
was predictable, they sought 
to stone him for blasphemy, 
"because you Uesus) being a 
man, make yourself God ." At 
his trial Jesus was asked a 
s imple and direct question , 
"Are you the Christ. the on of 
the B'lessed ?" And Jesu . sa id , 
" I am: and you wi ll see the Son 
of man geated at the right hand 
of Power, and coming with the 
clouds of hea ven ." Mark 14:61 · 
64 . It is painfully obvious who 
Je5us claimed to be; The 
Christ, The Son of God .. 
having the very same essence 
as the Father. 

How did Jesus view his 
death? In Mark 10:45 he says, 
" For the Son of man also came 
not to be served but to serve, 
and to give his life as a ransom 
for many." He also claimed at 
the Last Supper that his blood 
was being shed for the 
forgiveness of sins. The idea of 
the Messiah dying for the sins 
of the people was completely 
foreign to Jewish or Hellenistic 
thought at the time of Jesu , 
leading us to believe that the 
idea came from Jesus himself. 

Whal aboul his Resurrec-
tIOn? Did Jes us predict it and 
did it actua lly occur or was it a 
c lever in ve nti on of th e 
apos tles? We are told in Mark 
8:31·32 that k sus, "began 10 
teach them that the Son of 
man must suffer many thing ', 
ancl be rejec ted by the elders 
and the chief pries ts and the 
scribes, ant: be killed , and after 
three days rise a~ain . And he 
said this plainly . ' Jesus here 
pl ai nly predicts his crucifixion 
and resurrection. 

:;:..:.;,--: We are told by the New 
Testament that over 500 
people were eyewitnesses of 
the resurrected Jesus. VVhat 

court of law wouldn't accept 
the testimooy of 500 
eyewitnesses?! Here's another 
thought ; if Jesus didl1 'I appear 
to the apostles after his death , 
then they would obviously 
know that the Resurrect ion 
was a hoax. Yet ten out of the 
eleven apost les (minus Judas 
Iscanot ) dIed martyr 's deaths 
because they couldn't deny 
their experience of meeting the 
Re urrected Chri st. The only 
non·mart yr was John, who 
was boiled in oi l, then 
banished to the island of 
Pat mos. I wouldn 't die for a lie 
if I knew it was a lie, would 
you? 

Mr. Macdonald concluded 
his article by aying, "As far a 
faith goes, you either have it or 

Jesus plainly pre-
dicts cruczfixion 
you don 't. That 's not t he issue 
here. J don 't even know if 
there's an issue at stake. It's 
just 'interesting'." Yet there is 
an issue at ·take. Possibly the 
most important issue you will 
ever face. 

I would challenge you to 
exa mine th e hist ori ca l 
reliabi li ty of the claims of 
Jesll !-o of Nazareth. A good starl 
in your investigation mighl Ix: 
E,lidcllef' Ihal Demands ([ 
Verditl by Josh McDowell. If 
I'm wrong and Jesus isn'l the 
Son of God, all you've lost is a 
few hours s tudying a n 
"interesting" per so n . 
However, if Jesus is who he 
claims to be, the Resurrected 
Christ and only Saviour of the 
World , you had better believe 
in him because your eternal 
destiny is at stake. r would say 
it is a major issue, you might 
want to give it some thought.

I went undercover among the wild Dorm People 
By MICHAEL AHN 

Dorm People have a feel all 
of their own. Commuting to 
college leaves me very much 
out of touch with t hI S place 
and I seldom see it moving 
when the sun goes clown It 
eventually dawned on me that 
there is life after day at UCSD. 
I tned to hve It too, and I'm 

back with some prel t y 
interes ting tales. 

Someone once referred to 
lJCSD as "our litlle home 
away from rC'ality." This was 
never tru(' for commuters: It is 
('aw for U'i to head home and 
leave thIS place bchlOd 110mI', 
where W(' have Ix'('n for yrar", 
11110 fam il iar ~lIrrolJndll1gs. 

Dorm People don't have 
s uch surroundings. They area 
million light years from home, 
s leeping in unive rsity·owned 
bunk beds a nd never having 
any pri vacy.

ThaI bears rept'ating. Thl' 
only alone a Djl ran experience 
is in Ihe stall of it commllnal

real pain, to say the Itas t. 

Bu t then, they adapt to

bother thel11 , but that

after goi ng to my third party, 
the pattern stuck: the same

TWO OF THE IIICEST,SWEmST GUYS

AND UDI' UP QUARTERBACKS 
~ Now that we're not plaYln' 
football anymore, we spend more 
time poppin' tops off cans of Lite 
Beer from Miller than poppin' 
quarterbacks. 
DICK: But our favorite tOPIC of con-
versation CNer a couple of Lite 
Beers IS still the art of plaYln ' 
defense 
-.a: Yeah The bigger we were, 
the harder they fe ll 
DICK: Very true. Being big helps 
give you presence What I call 
winnmg through intimidation 

by 8Lbba Smith and Dck Butkus 
~ But you also have to play 
smart. Like watching the guy in 
front of you for a tip. Sometimes the 
position of a guard 's fee!'!1 tell you 
where he's gonna go once the 
bali IS hiked. Feet can teli you a lot 
I guess that's why shoes have

DICK: But smart guys remember 
they're on a team Work With a

maybe he can get through 
ThiS technique also works well 
when you want to get a Lite Beer 

in a crowded bar. 
_A: And dnnkin' lite Beer is one 
of the smartest things you can do. 
Because Lite's less fillin ', so it won't

DC may lose $40 million in 1982-83 
State Senator Ken Maddy says (there will be no money' remaining 

By HENRY SCHULMAN 
Sacrame nto Corn'~I>ondcnt 

The stat e's bleak economic 
foreca~t ha s prompted 
members o[ a key Senate panel 
to admit the University of 
California wi ll likely lose $40 
mi llion in capital outlay fund s, 
imperi ling dozens of construc-
tion and renovation projects. 

That revelat IOn came at a 
hearing of the Senate Finance 
education committee, which 

cancelled plans to rev lew the 
s t ate'" proposed capIt al 
a llocation to the unIversIty 
because the money will 
probably be unavailabie. 

"For us to go toto thi!'. 
doesn't seem to me a 
producti ve use of our time," 
Senator Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) 
said. "There will be no funds 
for capital out lay. The bottom 
line is t here wi ll be no money" 

The reason behtod the lack 

Violation delays 
election results 

Two election violatio ns, 
both concerning the Student 
Action Slate, prevented the 
a nnouncem ent of the 
A UCSD election results 
yes terday. 

Results are expected to be 
announced after a Judicial 
Board meet ing tonIght. 

The two violati0l1S, which 
stemmed from charges that 
Student Action latt' members 
Catherine Eic hhorn and 
Alfred Kakishiba campaigned 
whi le under suspension from 
pre\' IOUS violations, led the 
Elec ti on Commission to 
disqualify both Eichhorn and 
Kakis hiba. 

Results will not be released 
until Eichhorn and Kakishiba 
can appeal their disqualifica, 
tion to the Judicial Board. 

Both candidate~, upset with 
the Commission 's decision , 
claimed that their First 
Amendment right s were 
abridged. 

"We felt we were obliged to 
exercise our Fir t Amendment 
rights," said David Fisher, 
also a member of the Student 
Action Slate, who added that 
many of the slate members 
consciously violated the 

sanct ion of suspension whICh 
the JudICIal Board Imposed on 
the !'.Iate last \\eek . 

Many of the gnpes the 
Student ActIOn Slate ha . made 
against the A Election 
Commission and the Judicial 
Board center around the claim 
Ihat preventing a slate from 
campa igning is an abridge· 
ment of a ca ndida tes' 
con~titutiona l righls . 

And , added Eichhorn , "The 
baSIC feeling of the members of 
t he Elect ion Board was that 
the constitution wasn't the 
issue here." 

Present at Wedne~da y\' 
meeting was a representative 
from the American Civil 
Llbertle~ Un ion (ACLU) who 
challenged the constitu tIOnal 
basis of the electIOn codes and 
proced ures. (Whether the 
ACLU will choose to represent 
the Student Action Slate can 
not be co nfirmed yet. 
However, most mem bers of 
Student Action , due to the 
rlCLU repr e~enta ti ve's 
willingness to speak at last 
night's hearing, feel that the 
ACLU will very likely accept 
the ca e.)

De pite the campalgntng by

assured that the five UC 
hospitals would be granted 
special cons ideration under 
the proposed new procedures. 

Garamendi 's reform bill , in 
the process of being heard In 
the Senate Health and Welfare 

Committee, would establish a 
competitive bidding system

which facilities could receive 
Medi·Cal payments for 
medical services. 

All hospitals are currently

funding . They re ce ive

Medi-Cal reform bill 
threatens hospitals 
continued from page 5 
UC hospitals lose out in the 
bidding, the corresponding 
loss of Medi-Cal revenue could 
res ult in some hospital 
closures, 

But Garamendi , a Walnut 
Grove Democrat, shrugged off 
that claim, saying, "t he 
university can expect some 
funding reductions, but we're 
not going to put them out of 
business, At the same time, 
they should be more efficient. " 

He added the state. in 
bidding for Medi-Cal con-
tracts, would "consider the 
special nature" of the UC 
hos pitals becau e of their 
teaching role, and because 
three of them already provide 
their counties' Medi -Ca l 
health services. 

Garamendi ' s bill, co-
authored by Sen. Ken Maddy 
(R-Fresno), could also hurt UC 
hospitals by cutting medically-
indigent adults from Medi-Cal 
coverage. saving Californians 
$110 million, 

That reduction was one of 
several the committee heard 
testimony on last week, in a 
three-hour public hearing 
regarding a $500 million Medi-
Cal reduction reform package 
which includes service and 
eligibility c ut s, and a 
reduction of reimbursement 
levels. 

The package is a compro-
mise ironed out over several 
meetings bet ween Gov. Brown 
and legis lators from both 
parties. The cuts are designed 
as a first step to alleviate a 
projected budget shortfall next 
year of up to $2.5 billion. 

Under that proposal, $7 
million representing 1.100 UC 
hospi tal specialist intern 
positions would be cut. "There 
is an oversupply of specialists 
and it seems to me we ought 
not spend more money on 
them." Garamendi said . 

But he indicated he oppo ed 
the total package, which 
attempts to reform the Medi-
Cal system with immediate 
cost-cutt ing step in tead of 
long-range proposals found in 
his legislation. 

During last week's hearing. 
which only three Senators 
attended, s tate and local 
health department represen· 
tatives testified the cost would 
be difficult to absorb, since 
hospitals would have to treat 
the same number of patients 
with considerably less money 
from the state_ 

A Los Angeles County 
Health Department official 
said the Medi-Cal reforms 
could be carried out effectively 
only if the sta te increased 
funds it provides to local 
governments.

Teenagers sInoke regardless 
Warnings about the health 

hazards of cigarettes appear to 
have little effect in deterring 
teenagers from s moking, 
researchers at the University 
of California in Berkeley are 
discovering. 

The researchers have also 
found that girls are taking up 
s moking in greater number 
t han boys in the crit ical ixth-
to eighth-grade years, 

Their study, now in 
progress at UC's Lawrence 
Hall of Science, is trying to 
determi ne w hy these yout hs 
are smoking, and devi se 
s trategie to prevent it. 

The UC Berkeley re ear-
chers in education. psychology 
and public healt h report that 
the\' ha\'e thus far involved 
more than 2,500 Bay Area 
schoolchildren In interview. 
surveys and s torytelling 
activities designed to reveal 
what it takes to say "no" to 
s moking. 

The smoking youths they 
s urveyed appear to use 
s moking as a convenient tool 
for dealing with daily oeial 
dilemmas even if they take no 
rea l pleasure in cigarette . 

"We. ee the you ng people 
u sing cigarette ' to gain ocial 
stat ure rat her than expressing 
an intrinsic interest in 
c igarette smoking," said 
Herbert D. Thier. associate 
director of the Hall of Science 

and director of the study , 
which is supported with funds 
from the National Cancer 
Institute. 

Thier also said that the 
researchers have noted "the 
absolute meanin~lessness of 
health outcomes' of smoking 
to the yo ung s m oke r s. 
although the youths can 
readi ly identify the hazards. 

" They don't seem to 
consider the health hazards a 
personal threat ," he said. 

Principal investigators of 
the Berkeley study are Martin 
V. Covington. professor of 
psychology, and Carol N.

They saId they ha\'e also 
learned that sex, race and 
levels of social awareness and 
reason in~ abi lit y affect the 
student s smoking behavior. 

For example, no Asian 
students in a preliminary 
sample of eighth-graders 
reported current smoking, but 
a sig nificantly higher 
percen t age of Chicano 
student did. 

The proportion of girls who 
reported they smoke increased 
by \0 percent between the 
sixth and eighth grades,

According to Fisher, the

the commission on its right to 
sanction a suspension of 
campaign privileges . The 
ACLU representative termed 
the practice as a "prior 
restraint" of a candidate's

chose, however, to continue 
with the hearing, with the 
assumption that the election 
codes were "constitutional 
unless proven otherwise." 

At least one member of the 
Commission, Pam Gerber , 
who abstained from voting. 
felt somewhat uneasy with the 
constitutionality of the 
present codes. 

Gerber felt that the Elect ion 
Commi sion and the Judicial 
Board were functioning as 
best they could under the 
circumstance , and that "the 
fault lies in the administrators 
who a1\owed the codes to pass 
through (their hands) with 
orne questionable portions ."

The most popular explana-
tions for poverty, overpopula-
tion and hunger In the Third 
World are not only Irrele\ ant 
but dangerous , a biolog~' 
professor from the I'mversit\· 
of California, Santa Barbara 
told a session of the Amencan 
Associat ion for the Advance-
ment of SCience recentl\' 

The contenti()n~ - that 
populatIon pushes a region to 
the limIt of Its biological and 
phYSical re'iources, and 
"I here's no more nX)lTl In I he 
lifeboat" for those !>'Inking In a 
!>.ea of po\'erty, are often 
smokescreen" hidmg Ht he real 
causes and potentIal ,>olutlOn., 
of hunger .. 

So sav!>. William W_ 
Murdoch, -a t'e B populatIOn 
ecologist, who mamtalOs that 
these causes and solutIOns are 
political and economiC, not 
ecological or physical. 

In hiS paper on "Food 
Policie . Ecological versus 
Economic Perspectives, " 
Murdoch compare' BangIa' 
desh with Taiwan to make his 
POInt. 

"Bangladesh is among the 
most naturally fertile region" 
In the world. It population 
has twice as much arable land 
per head as doe Taiwan' '. 
However, Taiwan's rice vlelds 
are three time higher- than 
tho em Bangladesh. 

"And while nce vlelds to 
Bangladesh stagnate' and the 
rank of the malnOUrished 
grow, Taiwan is a rice· 
exporting nation faced with 
recurren t excesses of 
production. " 

The UC professor blames 
inadequate food production on 
" the maldi tnbution of 
productive resources," or 
stated more imply, a neglect 
of the rural population by a 
small. largely urban elite. 

He offers two profiles of 
Third World countries In the 
first, less than 10 percent of 
the rural populatIOn farms 
more than half the land, the 
best half. The vast majority of 
the people are squeezed onto 
the remaInder, with some:~O to 
40 percent ownIng no land at 
all. 

From thiS um'e\'en dlstnbu, 
t ion of land flows an une\ n 
dl"tnbulion of power -
economic and hence politIcal.

For your health: by Adam Barton Austin 

High blood pressure and hypertension: watch your salt 
Hyperten s ion, or high blood 

pressure. is estimated to be present in 
nearly 20 million white Americans and 
over 4 million black Americans. This 
represents about 15 percent of the 
white population and 27 percent of the 
black population. "Borderlinr" cases 
of hyperten ion. if included . wou ld 
push I he s tat istics to over 40 million 
people in t he US, or one In five 
Americans. that su ffer from this 
condition . 

Hyperten 'ion is diagnosed by si mpl y 
mea uring blood pressure. Blood 
pressure is the force ex rted against 
the walls of t he artery as the heart 
pumps blood through them. There are 
two phases of t he heart ' s pu mping 
action. Contraction is when the blood 
is pumped from the heart into the 
arterie",. Relaxation is when the blood 
flows into the heart from the veins. 

For a blood pressure of 125170. for 
example. the number 125 represents 

pressure exerted during contractIOn. 
This is called the systolic pressure. 
The number 70 represents the 
diastolic pressure or pressure exerted 
during the heart's resting or filling 
phase. 

The World Health Organization of 
the United at ions had defined blood 
pressures below 140/ 90 as normal. 
Blood pressuresov r I 60/9{) constitute 
high blood pressure. Pressures 
between Ih ese two represent 
"borderline" hypertension . 

The presence of high blood pressure 
dou bles the rio k of deat h from stroke, 
heart attack. and kidney disease. High 
blood pressure ranks as number one 
among th e risk factors fO.r 
cardiovascu lar diseases. Even more 
significant than smoking. blood sugar 
level. or cholesterol. high blood 
pressure appears to be the number one 
indicator of heart disease. 

The major factor related to 
hypertension is salt (sodium). The 
average American adult eats as much 
as ten grams of salt daily. In nations m 
which hypertension IS not widespread. 
less than half of thi ' amount is 
consumed. In most cases,consumption 
is less than one gram per day. 

The relallonshlp beween salt 111 the 
diet and high blood pressure was 
known as earlv as 1904. Salt Intake 
and its relat ion to hypertensIOn was 
suggested by a study of a farmIng 
society In northern Japan. There. the 
average consumption of salt was 26 
grams per day, and 811 percent of the 
people suffered from hypertension 

So, learning to eat foods and prepare 
foods without using salt mal be a good 
praet ice Toda). modern food 
production and preservatIOn 
industnes have continued to put 
Increased amounts of salt 10 our 
processed foods. Although nutritIOn 

labeling shou Id mclude a salt COntenl, 
very few products found in 
supermarkets list the amount of salt. 
There are. however. low·<.,odiu m

Williams not yet Regent 
By HANK SCHULMAN 

Sac ramento Correspondent 

The state Senate last week 
easi ly confirmed Edward 
Carter and Robert Noyce to 
the Universit y of California 
Board of Regents, but failed to 
confi r m Harold Willi ams 
becau e of an "oversight." 

The enate approved Noyce 
22-2 and Carter 27-2, the most 
votes any of the recent regent 
appointees garnered in the 
upper house. Appointees 

heldon Andelson, Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke and 
Jeremiah Hallisey were 
confirmed Thursday. 

There was no Senate debate 
on Carter, a retail store 
executive who has served on 

the Boa rd of Regents for 30 
yea rs. His confi rm atio n 
ye terday will provide him 
wit h anot her ix-year term. 

Noyce, president of the In tel 
computer firm in the Si licon 
Va ll ey, face d minima l 
opposition from Sen. HL 
Richardson (R-Arcadia), who 
implied he feared Noyce was a 
homo exual like Andelson. 

" Is he a friend of Sheldon 
An delson?" Richard!>on asked . 
''I'm wondering if we're 
appro,~lIlg anot her one of 
them. 

Senate lead r David Roberti 
(D-Lo!> Angeles) assured 
Richardson the two apointees 
live several hundrt'(] miles 
aparl, call1llg bot h "emlOently 
qualified" to be regents. 

Spring festival to 
be a happening 

Castanets and bagpipes, 
rebozos and harem pants 
enliven an ethnic dance 
program as the Bazaar del 
Mundo's contribution to the 
four exci tingdars of' 'Fiesta de

The Bazaar's courtyard will 
be transformed into a dance 
and demonstral ion pavillion 
from noon to 4 pm each 
afternoon. The public can not 
on I y watch the exci temen t bu t 
learn the steps from the pro 
as well. 

Traditional flamenco 
dancing leads off the event 
with the Bazaar's popular 
Rayna's Spanish Dancers (also 
slated for Sunday at 2 and 3 
pm). 

The Rub aiyat Dance 
Company will add a middle 
Eastern flavor today and 

Friday at I pm, feat uring the 
unusual "G hawazee" dance 
rooted in the Turkish 
tradition. Saturday and 
Sunday (at 2 and 4 pm 
respectively) the whole troup

Egyptian dances including 
demonstrations of the flashy 
"cane" and "sword" dances.

VP on UC relations 
continue d from page 7 
which gives facult y access to 
current te c hni ca l and 
product ion problems and 
keeps industry abrea'it of new 
research . 

" Indu stry needs ski ll ed 
person nel I n en tIcal hIgh 
technology areas and would 
welcome increased access to 
the fundamental research base 
of universities," he sa Id . 
"Universities need education 
and re 'earch oPIX)rtuOlties for 
students and faculty and 
financial sUPlxlrt for training 
and research from indust rial 
sou rces." Ill' noted that 
reduced approprIat ions from 
the slate and federal 
governments can no longer 
support sophIst Icat ed re-
search full\' . 

For the l)ublIc uni\ersity, he 
said. "t here IS a growIng 
consensu,", t hat funding for 
speCIal research shou ld not be 
accepted from a C()11pan~ 
\\' here the t and t \ mem ber 
1O\'ol\,('c\ 10 that re-l'arch hold" 
sui>stant lal stock or an 
equl\alent controlling interest 

in the company." 
Kendrick said that a faculty 

member who serves as a 
principal officer or has some 
other controlling position in 
outside firms in the area of his 
or her research is subject to 
pressures that could affect 
univerSIty responsibilitIes. 
"That old saying about he who 
pays the piper is based on a 
realistic: view of human 
behavior." 

He explained the University 
of California's IX)licy which 
requires a prIncipal invest iga-
tor to disclose any financial 
interest III the pmate ~IXms()r 
of indIvidual r('search. Before 
t he con tract or gran t is 
accepted a revIew is held if 
there IS any questIon of 
confli ct of interest. The 
d I~closure ..,t atcments are open 
to public inspection . 

"If SOClct V is to cont inue to 
believe Ill ' the l'nl\ersit\"" 
lovalt\ to truth, the 
relationshIp mu.,t lx' conduc-
ted in a "'iI\ that will lea\(' no

News writers meeting 
Everyone who intends to write for the Guardian 

News section next year shou ld plan on attending a 
mandatory wnters' meeting TODAY 1 4 :001 at the 
Guardian office. Anyone who has never written for us 
before is encouraged Lo attend. 

Richardson didn 't say why he 
thought Noyce was gay. 

T he Senate adjourn ed 
wi thout taking up Williams' 
confi rm at ion, the last of the 
six appointees Gov. Brown 
named in March yet to face 
approval. When asked why '1e 
had de layed Willi am s' 
hearing, Roberti admitted he 
forgot to bring it up. 

Williams, former chair of 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, faced no 
opposition during his Senate 
Rules Committee hearing 
where he was approved S-O. 
His Senale confirmation is 
st ill considered likely . 

All other appointees were 
granted easy confirmation 
except Andelson, who was 
approved with no votes to 
spare. Several senators said 
they opposed his appoint ment 
because of hi s avowed 
homosexuality. 

Abo last week, the Senate 
Finance Committee headed 
toward rejecting a bill 
requiring state employees, 
including those working for 
the University of California, to 
register as lobbyists when 
they try to influence 
legislat ion . 

Sen . Jim Ellis (R-EI Cajon) 
could muster only three votes 
on the IS-member committee 
to approve hi measu re, 
designed to conform state 
employees with provisions of 
the 1974 Political Reform Act. 

The voter-approved act 
s trictly limits campaign 
cont ributions from lobbyists 
and requires lobbyists to 
register with the secretary of 
state', office. It only applies to 
private employees, however. 

UC lobbyist Lowell Paige 
criticized the bill as too broad, 
requiring registration of 
dozens of university employ-
ees who annually appear 
before legislative committees 
to explain their budget 
requests. 

He al 0 objected to the bill's 
provision that wou ld have 
required him and members of 
his staff to list all the state 
agencies and legislators they 
try to influence. 

"I don't mind registering, 
buI making out all those 
reports would be beastly," 
Paige said before the vote. 
"We'd have to hire an extra 
girl in every office just to find 
out who we've been talking 
to." 

Ellis responded, "The 
university, quite frankly, is 
one of the groups being 
addressed by this legislation. 
Tho!>e of us who sat on 
subcommittees on education 
know we're bombarded by 
people from the university 
trying to influence us. Thesc 
people lobby, and they should 
be identified ." 

Several committee members 
disagreed, taking turns 
attackIng the Political Reform 
'\ ct itsclf as too restrIctive. 
Sen. Ralph DIlls (I)-Gardena) 
called EI lIs' bill "screwball 
legIslatIon," and asked , 
"When are we going to stop 
being like RUSSIa? Aren 't we 
entitled to act like free men 
once In a whileeven if we work 
for a government agency?" 

Committee Chair Alfred 
Alquist (l)San Jose) added the 
bill would " increase the 
absurd it v of the (reform act)." 

The -final vote on the 
measure was unavailab le 
because t he committee was 
s!lll 10 sessIon at press lime. 
Ell I.., needed five of SIX 
ab..,en t ('('s to appear and vote In 
favor of the legislation.

Baxtre ser began her study 
of the piano at an early age and

Detroit Symphony Orchestra 
by the time he was 13. She

I don't know about you, but

in films like An Unmarried

help of another woman, and 
after some trial and error, she 
succeeds. In addition to their

acoustic guitar in f.·ont of an 
electric band," it's more 
accurately classified as 
electric keyboards against an 
acoustic band. 

Guitarist John McLaughlin will play tonight at SDSU. 

Nevertheless, Belo Horizollte 
is a consistent, well produced 
and arranged effort, and 
demonstrates McLaughlin's 
composing as well as playing 
abilities to their best 
advantage. Among the 
vIrtuoso performing with 
Mclaughlin, Katia Labeque' 
piano as well as Tommy 
Campbell's progressive and 
intricate drumming style add 
up to an outstanding work. 
Paco De Lucia also app,ears on 
one track, "Manitas D Oro," to 
join Mclaughlin in an acoustic 
duet, reminiscent of their 

- seminal work in conjunction 
with AI DiMeola on the Friday 

Night in San Francisco live 
album. 

Opening for McLaughlin 
and his band wil be Katia and 
Marielle Labeque who will 
perform improvisational and 
composed works on two 
piano, which promises to be a 
great event in itself. 

Also in town thi week will 
the the Outlaws with War at 
Ihe Bacchanal Sunday for two 
hows at 8 and II p.m. , tickets 

are $8.50. The Outlaws are 
best known for their southern 
tyle hard-rock·multi -guitar-

on laught sound that 's been 
billed as the "guitar army" of 
the deep south. Their act can 
be best de cribed as mondo-
pretention at its best (worst?) 
and is one of the bes t bands to 

6l£niJJersifg C6ventsJ 
foimation 

see if you like mindless rock 
and roll. 

Touring to support their 
late t release, Los Hombres 
/11010, the Outlaw should 
deliver a high decibel, 
relentlessly hard driving, but 
nevertheless energetic show. 

In other concert news. the 
Clash's June 12 appearance at 
the Fox unfortunately sold out 
almost ins tantly. However, 
those of us who couldn 't get 
tickets can derive a little 
pleasure from the fact that in 
preparing for I he tour, the 
promoters discovered that one 
of the band 's members has 
mysterious ly disappeared .... 
Hopefu lly everybody with 
ticket s will have a good sweat 
until they find him.

his frustrations in coffee and

The Lillianne comes to town 
to participate in some art of 
festival and Eve, as you know 
he must, enters into an 

intimate relations hip with 
her. Hones t Eve soon reveals 
her feelings for Lillianne to her 
husband who initially laughs 
it off with the observation that 
such things are currently "the 
fashion" - maybe he has seen 
a few of these movies ... When 
he learns firs thand of the 

trut h of the matter, though, he 
explodes, drunkenly confron· 
ting Eve at a birthday party for 
one of their two children. 

Inevitably, Eve run off to 
live with Lilhanne at the 
commune, only to return to 
Amsterdam for a Kramer Vs. 
Kramer divorce proceeding. 
The film's ending is not 
altogether satisfac tory for 
everyone concerned, but you 
sti ll have that feeling that al\

benefitted from the expenence 
- LilIianne and especially Eve 

are now "belter, more

children (NOT named Cam

grow up to live happily ever 
after. 

For all its predIctability. A 
Woman LIke Eve IS a 
somewhat engaging story,

Birdie clips Birdw-atchers 
By ElAINE WALLACE 

taff Writer 

Remem ber the "silly 
students?" 

Remember the pledge to 
build a new college and call it 
Warren? 

Here's a newone- we could 
star t a new sport and call it 
badminton. We can name a 
nonexistent per on - Rick 
Fred -athleteoftheweek. We 
can even make badminton an 
intramural sport. 

Someone a lready had the 
idea. 

Badminton really has quite 
a following on campus and 
judging by the intensity of 
t heIr play , these raquet -
wielding birdie-smashers are a 
dedicated group. 

Yet badminton can produce 
many diverse reactions among 
its devotees. 

Mem bers of t he Bird-
watchers Chris Wood and 
Jeannine Bogaard "look 
forward to it all week long" 
and appreciate the chance to 
"sweat a little" at the Monday 
night " A " intramu ra l 
badminton matches. 

Chris Mills of By By Birdie 
felt a little more strongly about 
the port. 

" Badmint on i our ultimate 
high and our only purpose in 
life," he swore religiously. 

Such was the setting for the 

match between the Bird· 
watchers and By By Birdie. 
Frankly, I exDt7,ted to ~~nd a 
leisurely (read boring ) hour 
in the gym. Yet I found myself 
watching intently and even 
calling encouragement to the 
players. 

Badminton is a fast -paced, 
exciting sport. Soari.ng sh~ts 
are countered with Itghtenmg 
smashes and diving saves. 

It is really a thinker's game. 
Where to place the shot? How 
strong? How high? It doesn't 
seem like players have the 
time to answer all these 
questions, yet they do. 

They do, because mistakes 
hurt - not just the game, but 
the body. 

Wood was certainly an 
expressive player. He gave a 
new p,ronunciation to the word 
"agh ' every tim~ he smashed 
the bird. Other times he dove, 
to the ground trying to return 
the powerful smashes ~f Mills 
and Miller Newlon m the 
dou bles match. 

The game was involving, 
energetIc, exciting ... and I 
ound like a broken record . 

Seriously though, I wa 
really getting interested in the 
match. In fact. I almost got 
mad at Jeannine, Wood and 
Miller when theIr conversa· 
tion about people they knew 
from Pasadena threatened to 

disturb my concentrat ion. 
What is more important -

the win or how you played the 
game? 

By By Birdie says that both 
are equally important. Then 
again, they won the match 6·2. 
They take their badminton 
seriously and have a healthy 
amount of confidence in their 
play" Maybe unhealthy. 

• The males definitely 
showed superiority tonight," 
claimed Miller. 

The remark prompted Beth 
Moore to ask me to write that 
Miller was a male chauvinist. 

" I can't just write that," I 
told her. "You 'll have to give 
me a quote." 

But she didn't want to. I 
don 't think she wanted the 
notoriet y of Guardian 
exposure. Miller on the other 
hand , basked in the glow of 
publicity. 

"After the game, it 's Miller 
time," he exclaimed. 

He then proceeded to tell me 
that " badminton players fly by 
'night" and that they take 
Chicklets breaks and have a 
team mot her named Tweet ie· 
pie. 

It almost got to be too much. 
He wa~ just like those guys in 
the NFL who make funny 
faces and mouth "Hi Mom" at 
the camera. But I guess the 
game just wouldn't be the 
same WIthout them. 

Cliches: a never-ending stream 
By JOE F ALLEIT A 

!>cnior ' taf( Writer 
Two out. one on thIrd, 

bottom of the ninth, 3·2 
visitors. The batter fouls the 
next pitch off. 

"Attaway, Andy,. way to 
protect that plate,' the home 
dugout urge". . 

"C'mon. Cliff. make hIm be 
a hitter, now," the visitor's 
dugout calls out. 

Ball two. 
"Good eye, Andy." 
And on it goes, ad infinitum. 

ad boredom, the endles ' 
st ream of baseball cliches, 
colloquialisms or whatever. 
Along wit h the stats, baseball 
must have the longest list of 
cliches ever put toget her. 

Take "southpaw," for 
example, the term used for a 
lefthander. Legend has it that 
the term come from the old 
parks where the game was 
fir·t played . A lefthander 
would throw from the south 
side of the park or mound. 
hence, the term. 

Others are not quite as easy. 
Where did "Texas Leaguer" 

arise? The term denotes a 
shallow IXlP fly too deep for t he 
shortstop or second baseman, 
and too s hallow for the 
outfie lders. that drops for a 
single. Not a true hit in the 
sense of a screaming line drive 
- there's another one - but a 
hit nonetheless . 

How about a "banjo hitter?" 
Meant to denote a weak, 
ineffect ual hitler, the term 
probably derives from the 
effect of hitting a fastball with 
a banjo. 

A blue darter coonnotes a hit 
that darts between two 
infielders as though it had eyes 
- another one. 

Then there are the "frozen 
ropes" "and the "worm 
burners. 

A pitcher who is throwing 
well has "good stuff on the 
ball;" the batter are not 
hitting him. 

"Boy, he pulled thestringon 
that one."

"He has good stuff." The 
pitcher is "fannIng" the

"blowing them down" or 
"whiffing them." The batter 
"swished." 

Hitters. howeHr. will 
finally get tothe pitcher- the 
"hurler" - and "shellack" 
him, "clobber" him. "clout 
one," "park one," "put one 
away" and the pitcher will 
have "lost hiS stuff" and be 
'ent to the showers. The new 
pitcher, it is hoped, will then 
retire the side or put them 
away. 

Pitchers, however, are 
notonously poor hitters for the 
most part. Becau e of this, the 
American League instituted 
the designated hitter rule, 
which allows a de ignated 
batter to hit in the pitcher's 
spot in the lineup. Such a 
hitter is usually a "heavy" 
hitter or a "clutch" hitt er, 
capable of "punching one 
through the hole" in tight

Donuts & Juice Every Sunday 

Cycling circus 
By THOMAS SCHMIDT 

Staff Writer 
Last Saturday and Sunday, the UCSD Cycling Club 

hosted the Western League Intercollegiate Cycling 
Championships. The. We~t~rn Lea~e. is composed of 17 
universities state UntVersltles, and Juntor colleges. DUring 
the course ~f the season, 12 of these universities hosted 
races at which two of the three types of race~ were run: 
time 'trials, road race, and criterium, each reqUIring 
different skills and strengths. 

The time trial pits the cyclist against the clock. in a .test 
of individual intestmal fortitude. The road race IS a 
com binat ion of teamwork and an i mal desire. The cn terl u m 
is a shorter version of the road I ace with al1 the teamwork, 
aerodynamics and tactics condensed. . 

Tim Nicholson former Stanford cychst, and Western 
League race c~rdinator, modestly boasted, "More 
universities arejoining the league every year, the teams are 
improving, andsois the competition. SDSU is thes.trongest 
team in the field, but because of a shortage of fund 109, they 
were unable to compete in the races in Northern California, 
and missed picking up valuable points in. those races." 

Credit for the success of the SDSU cyclmg team goes to 
the odd couple of the cycling circuit, Shawn Storm and 
Davy Gyrllis. Storm , a junior national cyclin.g cham~ion , 
reminds one of a surfer out of water, and Gyrlhs looks hke a 
football player without pads .. Gyrllis is a world pl;lrsuit 
champion and the thought of hIm m pursUIt of anythmg or 
anyone is frightening. . 

Time trials were held Saturday morntng, a mIle east of 
Del Mar on the new ultra- mooth Fairbanks Ranch acces 
road. Pa~ticipant started at the inter ectlOn of El Camino 
Real and cycled east to the "Ne\\. Ranch," then s\\"ung 
around after 9.7 mIles. at an average speed of 24-27 mph . 

A few hours later. the road race began. The cour.e 
started on Black :\lountam Road. m front of Torrey Pines 
High chool. and ran m a roughl} triangular ~hape O\er 
Carmel Valle\' Road to EI Camino Real. and back to a 

murderou~ly '~teep hill up Black Mountam Road .. The 
course mcluded many sharp cune" wlthtrategtcally 
placed pot-holes. 'itrlmg head winds . an~ it;lpatie t 
cowboys m pickup trucks ThIS pastoral setting mcluded 
skeptical but interested horses and cattle who served a", 
the onl\" spectator~ over m~t of the course. 

In the 37 mIle women ''i road race. five contestant~ broke 
away early from the pack. four of them managed to hangon 
until the fimsh with a comfortable five mmute lead . The 
four were: 1. Cathy ;"1unson. Me a ]C; 2 t\1onlka

"'Twas like losiri a friend the day 
George Killian stopped brewiri the Red:' 
" 

n old friend, if you 
ask me, For nearly a 
hundred years, the 
lads all over this 

part of Ireland knew you 
could count on the Red. And 
count on the Red they did. 

"It was George Killian's 
family who brewed it. And 
for five generations, they 
was holdin' true to the taste. 
And if you ever had just a 
sip or two for yourself. you'd 
thank 'em for it. too. 

"But then came the black 
day George Killian stopped 
brewin' the Red. Some say it 
was the changin' times that 
backed him to the wall. 

• 'Modernize: they said 
to George. 

. 'Compromise: George 
said to them. 'And I'll have 
none of that Before I change the taste, I'll 
close the doors: 

"And close the doors he did-though a 
few of the lads came close to tears. And 
George Killian came close to tears, himself. 
Or so they say. 

"Then something grand happened. 
Over in America, Coors asked George 
if they could help him bring it back. 

"'Brew me Killian's Red?' George 
asked. 'Aye, I'd be proud to brew 
with you. If you be brewin' it my way.' 

"Now George's way was never 
the easy way It means slow--roastin' 
the malts. Takin' a bit more time. 
And a bit more trouble. 

li·A 

¥ 

"But that's what brings out the taste. And 
thats what brings out the glOriOUS red color 

"And I hear that's just the way they're 
doin' it. One sip, they say, and you'll know 
they're brewin' it Georges way. Of course, 

brewin'the Red 
Georges way is just 
what the lads all 
expected. 

"They don't for-
get what George 
Ki1lian always says: 

"'I stopped 
brewin' it once. 
And I can stop it 
again: " 

One sip and you'll know. They're still brewin'it Georges way.

N etters second in state 
By ELANA ROSEN 

As spectacu lar as second 
place in the Divi s ion II 
champions hip s sounds. 
volleyball coach Doug 
Dannevik explained t hat the 
UCSD spikers lost their final 
match (the first place position) 
merely because I he team was 
not "clicking." The defeal 
occurred in the California 
State Finals against Cal State 
Northridge, a team that UCSD 
dominated in previou s 
confrontat ions, yet lost to this 
weekend in three games. 8-15. 

10· 15 and 14· 16. 
Although Dannevik com· 

mented that the "team was 
never quite on track," the 
spikers ruled over a northern 
team in the sem i·finals, 
beating Sacramento State in 
three s traight games, 15·13, 
15-4 and 15·12. The coach 
continued to 'ay that UCSD 's 
loss was attributed to an 
excellent performance by. 
Northridge. who, judging by 
their high caliber play, 
"deserved to win." 

With the culmination of the 

men's vo lleyball season. 
Dannevik's reflections were 
not of disappointment With the 
last game, but sal isfact ion 
wit h the season as a whole. 
"The t am went as far as It 
could by qualifying for the 
Division II championships." 
fulfilling part of the coach's 
goab. Combined with the 
"llverall positl\e experience" 
wit h the team. Dann evlk 
expressed great feelings of a 
"rewardmg vear. Mv best 
season with the men:" were 
his concluding words. 

UCSD ultimate discs flying 
By ELANA ROSEN 

tnff Wriler 

Although Webster's defini· 
tion of entropy is "the 
tendency of an energy system 
to run down." the UCSD 
men's ultimate frisbee team, 
" Black's Beach Ultimate 
Entropy," revealed no such 
thing, as they dominated last 
weekend's tournament, the 
Horizontal Bowl , at Cal Poly. 

Remaining unde feat ed 
throughout the tourney -
consisting of ten teams -
Entropy proudly strutted from 
the field after the final game 
beari ng their first place 
trophy, appropriately enough, 
a mounted disc. 

Flowing easily through 
prelimi nary games in the 
morni ng, t he team won their 
pool and confronted San Diego 
State's "Plastic Tortillas" in 
the finals. 

The ultimate excitement led 8·2, leaving little room for 
began here, as the tortillas error, if Entropy were to 
quickly gained possession and maintam a pos ition in the 

game. 

After hearing t he score 
announced on the PA system, 
however, Entropy warmed up. 
With incredibly accurate disc 
handling during offensive play 
and amazing diving during 
defense, t hey began their 
comeback , scoring twelve 
consecutive points, finally 
winning 15· 12. 

This was the first 
championship in UCSD's 
ultimate frisbee history . 
Overall outstanding perfor-
mances by all players and a 
tremendousl y supportive 
sideline created an energy that 
could only be described as 
entropic, the supreme law of 
nature governing all. 

The cost 
of leaving 

just went down.

spots. Occasionally . the heavy, 
hitters will fall into "slumps. ' 
and orne won't even "hit their 
weight." When they pull out of 
their slumps, they usually "hit 
a ton" or "paste it." 

The heavy hItters are 
usually placed in the Imup 
where they will do the most 
good, such as the "cleanup" 
spot. Tt is there that the team 
hopes they will come up to bat 
with the bases loaded ("the 
sacks full") and hit a grand 
lam mer. 
When a hitter gets too close 

to the plate (see "protect that 
plate" above) the pitcher will 
try to "brush him back." 
Often. the hitter will be 
"beaned." This beaning or 
"brushback" usually results 
in a "rhubarb." Following 

that, one or more players are 
usually ejected, or to sed out. 

The Infield consists of " first 
sack," "keystone base." 
" hort-stop" and "hot corner." 
No "lead gloves" here, each 
must be capable of making the 
hard plays look easy. They are 
"good glovemen" and have 
"cannon arms." 

And the Ii t is endless. ThiS 
article has only scratched the 
surface. In a recent San Diego 
Padres game, announcer Jerry 
Coleman spoke of a "young 
phenom" which brings up, of 
course, the "bonus baby' 

One could readIly reach the 
conclusion about halfway 
through that game that one 
could ea i1y fill a book on 
ba eball jargon alone. 

Then there are baseball

" I'll probably keep building boards until I die of cancer from epoxy and acetone exposure." 

Wiggley has a good Ring 
By PETE NEWMAN 

If you are normall y aware of 
what is going on around you, 
YOU ha\e probably noticed the 
name "Uncle Wiggley" in a 
number of unu ual places. 
Why IS t he name of some old 
kiddies' book character 
plastered on stickers and 
skateboards allover our 
campus? Well . It turns out that 
Uncle Wlggley attends UCSD, 
in t he clever disguise of 
sophomore AM ES st udent 
Doug Ring. 

Operating out of a Pacific 
Beach workshop, Ring 
produces ome of the finest 
quality, mo. t technologically 
advanced skateboard decks on 
the market today, at ome of 
the lowest prices. I t is no 

wonder t hat a lot of people are 
riding his skateboards around 
campus. 

The first Uncle Wiggley 
boards appeared in Ring's 
homeground of Marin County 
in 1976. Since then he has 
refined and expanded his 
production techniques. and 
earned an underground 
reputation as an innovator. 

He enjoys working with 
exotIc material , such as 
homeycomb·cell cores (as used 
in Hexcel skiis), and graphite 
and Kevlar skins. These high · 
technology sticks cost a little 
more. but t heir stiffness and 
light weight put them in a 
class apart from ordinary 
wood boards . 

Uncle Wiggl ey makes 

wooden boards as well, but 
these aren't ordinary either. 

ix plies of Canadian maple 
and two la yers of 4·ounce·per· 
square·yard fiberglass are 
bonded with heat ·cure epoxy 
resins, and pressed into special 
molds under high temper' 
atures and 70 tons of pressure. 
The molds shape the kicktall 
and give t he deck a concave 
cross ·sect ion for better 
footing. This process albo 
produces a board which IS 
strong and durable. as well as 
highly functional. 

Ring has made for him elf a 
unique niche in the skateboard 
market. One of on ly five deck 
manufacturer in California, 
he has a steady production 
volume of 15 or so boards per 
week, with about half of them 
being sold in retail stores and 
the other half by Ring himself. 
H is low product ion and labor 
costs keep t he pric es 
significant ly lower than those 
of larger companies; the 
standard co nca ve maple 
laminate deck costs around 
$24, and a totally \:!qUIpped, 
premium·quality skateboard 
runs about $75. Add one of 
Uncle Wiggley\ distlOctive 
argyle graphic deSIgns, and 
you have got a lOugh, modern 
skateboard, equally at home 
cru isi ng bet ween cl asses, 
gelling radical in a skatepark, 
or anywhere in bet ween.

In this course you will read some representative European 
writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: Bruno, 
Campanella, and Galileo (Italy); Montaigne, Descartes, and 
Pascal (France); and Bacon, Burton, and Browne (England). 
Through a close study of selected texts and a wide variety of 
literary strategies that they embody (Hermetic treatises, utopias, 
dialogues, essays, dream-books, etc), you will seek to examine 
and define the constitution of a language of 
science, located in the fundamental tension 
between analytical and figurative discourse. All 
readings will be in translation, although a ... ~~ 
knowledge of French, Italian, or Latin is 
desirable. Requirements: one class report, one 
fifteen-page paper.
