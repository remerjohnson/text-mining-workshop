ETERNAL FLAME? MEChA 
Members 
March, Burn. 
Flag in Protest 
DEMONSTRATION: As many 
as 55 students denounce 
Propostions 187 and 209 
By Adam Nichols 
Guardian Reporter 

Between 50 and 55 university students from 
aero s San Diego County, all members of the 
Movimiento Estudianti/ ChicOl!o de Azt/all 
(MEChA) group, banded together Tuesday ,Nov. 
26 to march against Propositions 187 and 209 
and si milar legislation. 

Grouping at (he Sav-On drug store at Villa 
La Jolla Dr. and Nobel Dr. , the red and green-
clad marchers proceeded to UCSD whi Ie chant-
ing slogans such as "No justice, no peace!'· and 
"Look around and what do you see? A lack of 
diversity!" 

Occasionally blocking traffic on its way to 
the campus loop road. the group drew honks 
from several pa sing motorists. The group 
stopped in front of the Gei el Library and ev-
eral peakers urged marchers to take action 
against legislation the group found offensive. 

"I challenge you to come out and learn," one 
. peaker said, encouraging marchers to educate 
them elves about their own cultural hi story in-
stead of relying on what the peaker said was 
scant coverage in popular history texthooks. 

Other speakers ca lled the march a second

tum in California. 

The marchers then walked to Peterson Hall 
and through the Mandeville Center. ending out-
side the Gymnasium ncar the Student Center. 
Two students holding an upside-down Ameri-
can nag led the marchers, amid chants of "Pete 
Wilson, you can't hide, we charge you with 
genocide!" and "Civi l rights and civil war, we 
won't take this shit no more!" 

Marchersalso addressed what they perceived 
as blatant exism in nearly all cultures. 

"My message is not only to the mujeres 
[women), but to the hombres [menltoo ... you 
need your sisters," past MEChA chair Maria 
Figueroa said. 

The focus of the protest was the education of 
the minority populace in general.

UCSD Dance Program Breaks Ground for Its New Building 
CHANGES: Program 
seeks joint status with 
Theatre department 
By Rebekah Michelson 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD theater 
department's dance program i 
currently undergoing major 
changes; including the 
groundbreaking for a new dance 
building, the addition of a dance 
major and the movement to estab-

lish dance as an officially-recog-
nized department. 

The groundbreaking for the new 
dance bui Iding took place on 
Wednesday, Nov. 20. The building, 
which is lated to open in fall 1997, 
will be located in the eucalyptus 
grove bet ween the Che Cafe and the 
Mandel Weiss Auditorium. 

For some, the building cannot be 
completed soon enough. The pro-
gram is currently located in the main 
Gymnasium, and dancers are con-
tinually sliding on noors that they 

de 'cribe a too slippery. 
"Everyone is getting injured," 

Muir freshman Adrienne Sarlos 
said. 

To prevent further injuries, the 
gym floor was malted during 
Thanksgiving break with a peeial 
material while the new building is 
under construction. 

This quarter, the dance program 
offered a major in dance for the first 
time. 

"The major requires a tudentto 
choose a specific area of dance, but 

also requires that the student be in 
an advanced level of one other area 
of dance," Professor Margaret 
Marshall said. "We don't limit our 
student by tining their creativity, 
but they are trained." 

The dance program currently 
offers classes in jazz, ballet, mod-
em dance, ethnic dance, the history 
of movement and theory of dance. 
Marshall said she i attempting to 
create a dance-therapy class in con-
junction with the UCSD School of

developed by a UCSD research 
group. under the direction of chem-
istry and biochemistry Professor 
W . E, Moemer and postdoctoral 
student Robert Dickson. 

The group developed a method. 
termed a "protein trap," for ob-

group published an anicle in Ihe

Using a porous. transparent gel 
called polyacrylamide (PAA). the 
team of scientists trapped proteins 
and used fluorescent molecules 
already in place within the protein 
to follow its acti vity under a mi -

Researchers have recently be-

Kinesins function as transport 
molecules within the cell , moving 
important materials - including 
otherproteins - fromoneorganelJe 
to another. Operating as a sort of 
supply ship. Ihe kincsins shuttle 
their cargo along microtubules -
hollow threads within the cell s that 
serve as a highway for the proteins. 

The kinesin 'characteristic move-
ment becomes especially important 
during events such as mitosis. or cell 
divi ion, when they are believed to 
help al ign the chromosomes contain-
ing the cell's genetic material.

Chancellor Dynes Addresses Academic Senate Assembly 
SPEECH: Dynes talks 
about medical center, 
campus diversity 
By Leena Shankar 
Staff Writer 

T hough admitting there are some 
i sues that need further discussion. 
Chance llor Robert Dynes described 
UCSD as a generally healthy cam-
pusduring his fir tState oftheCam-
pus address at last Tuesday's Aca-
demic Senate Representati ve A s-
sembly meeting. 

Dynes gave the most time to the 
UCSD Medical Center. which lost 
$20 million last year. With four other 
major health-care providers in the 
San Diego area. UCSD attracts only 
10% of the health -care market. 

D ynes attributed the loss to the 
medical center 's low market share 
and higher-than-averagecosts asso-
cia tcd with its teaching mission. 

"The UCSD M edica l Center has 
two missions: education and re-
earch." he said. ' 'There is no mecha-

nism in place to cover the costs of 
education, so in thi s competitive 
markel. we arc losing." 

However, Dynes said closing the 
medical school was not an option. 

'.'Not having the UCSD medical 
school is not in the equation, 
though," he said. 

Accordi ng to Dynes. another rea-
on for UCSD's financial situati on 

is its close proximity to the U.S.-
Mexican border. 

"The state has finall y woken up 
to the fact that indigents cost UCSD 
several million dollars." he said. 
"The responsibility has fa llen on 
UCSD and it is not fair. " 

One proposal for reviving the 
medical center was to enter a pan -
nership with one of the other health · 
care providers in the county. 

In a similar move. last month the 
UC Board of Regents voted to merge 
UCSF's clinical acti viti es with 
Stanford Health Services. 

However. Dynes said massive 
i nfusions of cash wouldn ' t be 
enough to salvage the hospital. 

" M oney alone won' t so lve the 
problems," he aid. " We also need a 
greater patient base. Only 40 to 50 
percent of the hospi tal beds are fi lled 
here." 

Dyne also brieOy touched upon 

"1 hold the belief 
and commitment 
that this campus 
must reflect the 
diversity of the 
community. If we 
don't do this, then 
the community will 
walk away and 
declare u. 
Irrelevant. " 

- Robert Oynes 
Chancellor 

affirmative action in his address. 
" I hold the belief and commit-

ment that thi s campus must reflect 
the diversity of the community." he 
said. " If we don' t do this, Ihen the 
community will wa lk away and de-
clare us irrelevanl." 

[n ordcr to preserve the diversity 
of the c3mpu • Dynes proposed ex-
panding existing affirmative-action 
committees and starting diversity 
commissions. 

" If 209 sustains, then thi is the 
starting point and we will look to 
the future." he said. 

Dynes also poke about this 
year 's undergraduate enrollment of 
14,623, down 223 from last year. 
Approximately 2S,OOO students ap-
plied for 2.S00 seats in this year' s 
freshmancl a • with averageGPA's 
of more than 3.9. The average enter-
ing freshman 's SAT scorewa 1225. 

D ynes said he expects an even 
greater number of application s nex t 
year. because of the "Tidal Wave 
II" as the baby boomers' children 
reach college age. 

" In the coming years ... there w ill 
be 20.000 to 30.000 more applica-
tions," Dynes said. "There arc then 
two options. One is to open a new. 
tenth campu • and the other is to 
expand the nine ex isting campuses. 
M y choice is growth." 

Further, Dynes addressed fac-
ulty recruitment. UCSD recently 
added 46 new faculty members. and 
is looking to rccrui t 30 more. 

' 'The (Iua l i ty of professors we 
arc hiring is ~tUllnil1g." Dynes sa id. 
" I f you hire people a lot beller than 
you. then you look reaIIY'limart. " 

" [ f you identi fy someone who 
will be a new leader. please bring 
them to me." he added. 

After Dynes' address. Marshall 
Provost Cecil L ytle spoke about the 
proposed UC D Charter H igh 
School. The formal proposal for the 
schoo l will be presented 10 the a~­
sembly at its January meeting. 

"This charter high school is for 
low income and high potential stu-
dents," L ytle said. "The lion' s share 
of the funds for th is school wou Id 
come from the San Diego Ci ty 
School District."

Ihe school is availab le for viewing

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian M.onday, Dcc:ember 2. 1996 

PINION 

LIKE CREATIONISM, 
MUCH OF EVOLUTIONARY 
'FACT' MUST BE TAKEN 
ON FAITH 
., ............ 
Opinion Editor 

Much to the COIlSlemlllion of reli-
gious cOOservatives, Pope John Paul 
II, in an Oct. 23 leller to the 
Pontifical Academy of Sciences, 
announced his support for the theory 
of evolution. In fact, the pope went 
so far as to say that evolution is 
"more than just a theory." 

With good reason, scicntists 
claim that we have strong evidence 
that natural selection - a key mech-
anism in the evolution of life -
actually occurs. Most of us are 
familiar with cases in which envi-
ronmental changes caused changes 
in a population of animals. 

Take, for example, the famous 
case pf the peppered-moth popula-
tion in early industrial England. In 
the absence of pollution, the moth 
population '-'OIItained both light-and 
dark-colored members. With the 
onsel of pollution and the conJC-
quen! darkening of tree barks upon 
whicr. the moths congregated, the 
moths' predators were able to easily 
see the light-colorcd moths but not 
the dark-,-'Olored ones. The popula-
tion .was thus effectively 
purged of light-colored 
moths. Hence the 
population 

evolved from a mb(IUre of colors to 
only one color. 

No raJ.ional person would reject 
this or any similar account of popu-
lation change by natural selection. 
However, it is one thing to recognize 
this kind of population change, but it 
is quite another to claim thlll narural 
selection combined with known 
mechanisms for producing genetic 
diversity in a population can account 
for the grand-scale changes argued 
for in the theory of evolution. 

The evolutionists' tale begins 
with the fonnation of earth 4.5 bil-
lion years ago. Out of the "primor-

THE POPE'S EMBRACE OF EVOLUTION 
REPRESENTS PROGRESS FOR BOTH 
SCIENCE AND RELIGION 
., .... a.n 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Recently, Pope John Paul II 
made statements in support of 
Darwin's theory of evolution. 
Although the chureh had previous-
ly expressed tolerance of evolu-
tionary theory (the last time was in 
1950), the pope's statement is 
remarkable in that it supports the 
beliefs of many Catholics. The 
pope should be applauded for 
using his esteemed position to try 
10 guide people into considering 
more flexible interpretations of the 
Bible. Hopefully this will knock 
some sense into those who cling to 
a narrow, literal view. 

No religious theory should be 
taught as fact 
without 
legiti-

mate appeals to scientific evidence . 
Quite simply, creationism should 
not be taught in school as a science 
because there is no scientific evi-
dence to support creation the way it 
is literally reported in Genesis. 
Nevertheless, the fight to include a 
discussion of creation "science" in 
school curricula continues. After 
members of the Christian right 
took over the Vista school board a 
few years ago, controversy arose 
after some board members tried to 
mandate the leaching of creation-
ism in science classes. 

I'm not arguing that only mod-
em evolutionary theory should be 
taught in schools because it is 
absolutely correct, but because it is 
the best explanation we have so far 
in light of the evidence. Maybe 
someday we'll find out that the 

world really was created in 
seven days, but right now we 
don't have' the scientific evi-
dence to support that claim. 

Furthermore, it 

. seems futile to search for scientific 
evidence that supports creationism. 
The Bible was nOl intended as a 
scienti fic explanation of our exis-
tence, and the people who wrote it 
did nOl have the background to 
understand sorne of the scientific 
information we now know. 

According to many biblical 
scholars: the writers of Genesis 
believed that the sky was full of 
water and that under the earth 
were fountains of water. We know 
now that they were wrong. The 
Genesis writers were probably 
making their best scientific cxpla-
nation or creation from the world 
they observed. On the other hand, 
maybe they didn't care about sci-

COMMENTARY: The mainstream press used to do a good job informing the public about the dangers of AIDS, 
but now the news media mislead us by ignoring AIDS and promoting partial scientific breakthroughs 

MEDIA FAIL TO ENCOURAGE HIV AWARENESS 
By __ ye. WIll .. 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

In June 1981 , the Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta 
reported five unusual ca~es of pneu-
mocystic pneumonia in homosexual 
men in Los Angele . Since then, 
more than 506,538 cases of what we 
now call AIDS have been diagnosed 
in the United States, and 315,928 
Americans with AIDS have died. 
Last December, the CDC reported 
that 88,604 adults and adole cents 
with AIDS and 30,377 with mv 
lived in California. 

Men and women, homosexual 
and heterosexual s, teenagers, chil-
dren, and infants of every race, reli-
gion, nationality and economic sta-
tus contract HIV or die from AIDS 
evcry day. 

When wa the last time you saw 
the e statist ics on the evening news 
or in the newspapers? When was the 
last time you saw a commercial 
about AIDS and how to protect 
yourself? When was the last timc 
you thought about what you might

be doing, or not doing, to expose 
yourself to HIV and AIDS? 

When AIDS first emerged, the 
news media were quick to tell us 
that the disease struck only homo-
sexuals and intravenous-drug users. 
But they also warned us that we did-
n't know whether it was airborne, or 
if we could catch it from a toilet scat 
or from a public swimming pool. 
Panic spread through America as 
parents fought to keep youngsters 
with AIDS from attending their 
children's chools. Society accused 
tho e who had contracted HIV of 
wrongdoing, telling them it wa 
punishment for their reckless 
behavior. 

Then the government, and the 
media, learned more about the dis-
ease, including that HlV is only 
contracted through contact with an 
infected person's bodily Ouids. 
Suddenly a burst of media attention 
focused on AIDS education and pre-
vention. Communities rallied to 
help_ raise money rOt research, and 
the CDC sponsored commercials to

percent effective 
way to prevent the 
spread of AIDS and 
HIV .s to abstain 
from sex and to 
never share needles, 
even with your 
buddies. 
educate the pUblic. People were 
starting to make a difference and 
starting to care. 

Then Bill Clinton came into 
office and government attention 
turned toward the economy. 0.1. 
Simpson became the lead story of 
every news hour, every newspaper 
and every talk show. Then politics 
and the election took center tage. 
AIDS awareness and attcntion qui-
etly slipped olT the media's radar 
screens. Just as subtly, Americans 
started forgetting about the dangers 
that lurk in strangers' beds and at 
the ends of other people's needles. 
AIDS hadn 't gone away; it had 
merely stopped being a sound-bite. 

Now it scems that when we hear 
about HIV or AJDS it's only good 
news. There 's a three-drug cocktail 
that seems to prolong the lives of 
many HIV patientfi by slowing the 
course of the virus. No celebrities 
have been reported to contract or 
die from AIDS in rccent m nths. 
··AIDS mu t be going away." is the 
judgment of many Americans. 

Well, it's not. Americans rely on 
news media for the information they 
need to protect themselves. When 

the media "forgets" about AIDS, so 
do Americans. 

Television produccrs need to put 
AIDS back in the spotlight. 
Children who were "too young to 
talk to about AIDS" are now in a 
position to gct AIDS, and we can't 
rely on schools to tell them evcry-
thing thcy need to know. When the 
evening news tells us how ellcctive 
HIV drugs are, why not remind us 
what tcrrors they're Ireating? Why 
not remind us of other countries that 
have been ravished by AIDS 
becausc of a lal,;k of education: pre-
vention and research efforts? 

Media coverage could includc 
the stories of triumph and tragedy of 
people with AID , and how people 
with HIV live in fear of developing 
AIDS. Commercials could once 
again depict the scriou ness of 
AIDS and HIV and how not to 
come in contact with it. Rather than 
hcing just some ovcrgrown and 
obscure database, thc Intemet has 
the potential to be a powerful media

6 OPINION 

SCIENCE: 
Evolution still has 
many problems 
Continued from pace 4 
tr ies (induding dinosaurs), and rep-
tiles evolved into birds and mam· 
mals. And from the earliest mam· 

mal~ evolved apes and, eventually, 
human beings. 

I dispute the case for large·scale 
evo lution on a fundamental level. As 
an example, consider the notion that 
reptiles are the ancestors of birds. 
Evolutionists claim that reptilian 
!>Cales are the predecessors of avian 
leathers, and reptilian fore limbs the 
prcdcccssors of avian wings, But 
just consider the case of a limb 
evolving into a wing. The many 
functions of a reptilian limb are 
dependent upon its unique character-
istics . Reptiles need well-defined 
claws and feet to navigate rugged 
terrain and catch prey. Reptilian 

RELIGION: 
Creationism is not 
legitimate science 
ContInued from lNIIe 4 
ence at all , and intended to 
metaphorically convey theological 
messages through the story. 

Would it have made sense for 
God to tell the ancient Israelites 
that the animal species gradually 
developed through natural selec-
tion, or .hat we are made up of tiny 
cells which have DNA that deter-
mine how we look? Needless to 
~ay. they wouldn ' t have understood 
these facts. 

Moreover, from a religious point 

limbs also need to be not so ungain-
ly as to prevent effective locomo-
tion, 

But avian wings are very different 
from repti lian limbs. Wings must he 
long enough to constitute an effecti ve 
airfoil. They must also be light 
enough to produce a favorable lift-to-
weight ratio. Contrast these require-
ments for a wing with the require-
ments for an effcctive reptili an limb. 
A reptilian limb must be strong 
enough to support at least one quarter 
of a repti le's weight, whi le a wing 
must be light enough for an organism 
to be able to ny. A rept ilian limb must 
he useful (i.e. short) enough to enable 
the organism to get around on the 
ground. An avian wing must be long 
enough to enable the animal to ny. 

Question: How could an intenne-
diary limb enable a reptile-bird to 
survi ve in its environment? It seems 
that a limb-wing would not be useful 
either for walking around on the 
ground (or catching prey) or for ny-

of view, it really doesn' t matter 
whelher creationism or evolution is 
true. Either way, what is really 
important is the issue of how human 
beings should treat each other. 

Also, knowing the exact mecha-
nism for crealion does not have to 
afTect one's bel ief in God. If one 
believes that God is infinite beyond 
our comprehension, then it would 
make IiCnse for us to say we cannot 
understand creation. We can only 
do our best in our limited terms to 
define God or the infinite. 

The human mind cannot grasp 
infinity. Whether one believes that 
there is a God - an infinite power 
- behind the creation of the uni-
verse is purely a matter of faith. And

about the evolutionary proces. 
Richard Dawkins holds to a "gradu-
alist" view of evolution, in which 
limbs can and in fac t do become 
wing over time. However, noted 
Harvard zoologi. t Stephen ~ay 
Gould considers the "gradualist" 
theory inadequate and favors what i 
known as the "punctuated equili bri-
um" approach to evolution, in which 
speciation occurs through alternating 
periods of rapid biological change 
and stasis. Gould himself stated in an 
article in Paleobiology that "the 
absence of fossi l evidence for inter-
mediary stages between major tran· 
sitions in organic design, indeed our 
inability, even in ou r imagination. to 
construct functional intermediates in 
many cases, has been a persistent 
and nagging problem for gradualis-
tic accounts of evolution." 

And keep in mind that birds dif-
fer from reptiles in thousands of 
ways besides appendage type. The 
fact of the matter i , leaving aside the 

be lieves that God is the creator, 
although he suppons Darwin' theo-
ry that species evolve through the 
process of natural selection, 

The pope's announcement hope-
fully will have a positi ve innuence 
on mankind. It will help to create a 
badly needed truce between science 
and religion. There are cnough sim-
ilarities between them that the two 
can work together. 

The tenets of the Baha' i religion 
say that religion without science is 
superstition and that science with-
out religious idea ls can lead to 
immorality. People can use science 
for their own grccd, or to create 
weapons of destruction that can kill 
us all in minutes. Religion by itself 

.. 

Monday, December 2; 1996 

embarrassing paueity of fossil evi-
dence, evolution has yet to provide a 
plausible account of how one species 
can evolve into a very different 
species. 

So what could the pope have had 
in mind when he said that evolution 
is "more than Just a theory"? It 's too 
bad he didn't mean that evolution is 
also a religion, given that scientists 
cast grand-scale evolution as scien-
tific "facl." Hopefully what he did 
mean was that microcvolution in dis-
tinct species seems to be plausible. 

It would be wrong to point to the 
pope's dec laration as a refutation of 
the idea (which, interestingly, some 
atheists strugg le wi th) that there is a 
design to the uni verse. Evolut ion has 
not proven that we humans are here 
only by the vicissitudes of chance, 
that we ex ist only by vi rtue of natur-
al and not supematural processes. 
Before evolution can be touted as 
scientific fact, it still has a lot of 
explaining to do, 

can lead to witch burn ing and wars. 
So avenues involvi ng both science 
and reli gion must be investigated. 

Science docs not have to mean 
that life is random and withou t 
meaning. Religion and science can 
coexist. I' m glad that science has 
given us medicine and technologies 
that make life easier, Science is one 
of the reasons God gave us minds. 

I'm also glad that religion is 
here to help our li ves become 
meaningful. Scienti sts with a moral 
purpose can solve many of the 
problems of the world. Work ing 
together we can come closer to 
understanding these seemingly 
incomprehensible truths of God: 
creation and infiniteness.

DANCE: Many 
students also dance 
professionally 
Continued from pace 1 
Medicine. 

The program has proposed cre-
aling a joint theater and dance de-
partment, which theater faculty have 
voted unanimously to support . 

"We hope to change the depart-
menl name from the department of 
Theater to the department of The-
aler and Dance," said Judy 
Rodriguez, undergraduate coordi-
nator of the dance program. 

Marshall slartcd UCSD's dance 
program 22 years ago. 

''The dance program at UCSD 
began with only one full-time faculty 
member - myself - and only a few 
part-timers," Marshall said. "Now, 
we receive ovcr 700 applicants every 
year. Dance grew because there was 
and is a need for thi type of art." 

The program was originall y 
within t:le physical-education de-
partment, but moved to the theater 
department in 1991. 

'1'he move from P.E. to theater 
was a good move for us, because 
Dance is more art than exercise," 
Marshall said. 

However, staffing problems have 
continued since the program's early 
days.

groundbreaking ceremony for UCSO's new dance building. 

"We currenlly have nine part-
timer , but there just aren' t enough 
hours in the day," Marshall said. 

According to Marshall, many 
indi viduals both in the UCSD and 
La Jolla communities have profited 
from UCSO's dance program. 

"Fir t of all , Ihe dance program 
brings one of the beSI educational 
dance programs in the state to 
UCSD," she said. "We draw on the 
best facult y locally, and invite na-
tionally recogni zed guest artists to 
perform and teach in our depart-
ment." 

The dance program parti cipates 
in two presentations every year, one 
choreographed by faculty members 

and the other by studenls. The fac-
ulty production. called "Evening of 
Dance," will take place on March 
14- 16. 

Many UCSD dance sludcnts par-
ti cipate in troupes such as the Cali-
fornia Ballel company and the San 
Diego Ball et company. 

"Not eve rybody co ming to 
UCSD has to be a Bio major," 
Marshall said. " It is good to adapt 
10 everything fo r a successful fu -
ture."

major in biology and dance had onl y

RALLY: MEChA 
plans to continue 
protest strategy 
Continued from page 1 
educate themselves in term of poli · 
tics, especially at the federal level." 

M OS I participants, inc luding 
Revelle sophomore Linda d allegos, 
said they attended the march be-
cau e of California's current polili-
cal and social climale. 

"We wanl C4ual representation 
in schools," Gallegos said. "Thi, is 
a publ ic insti tution. It 's supposed to 
be represenlative of the populat i(m 
of California." 

Several speakers alluded 10 feel-
ings of being Ihreatened and over-
looked. They said legislation such 
as Proposi tion 209, denounced as 
"educational genoci de," does noth-
ing to alleviale these fears. 

"People of color and women are 
becoming more marginalized in thi 
ociety, in th is university," said 

MECha member Mike Rodriguez. a 
Marshall senior. "[The protest] is a 
march against inj ustice." 

The march was the second in 
what organizers said was a number 
of planned demonstrations. Two 
weeks ago, MEChA took part in an 
anti-Proposition 209 protest at 
UCSD and made a number of de-
mands of the administration. The 
demands included university non-
compliance with Proposition 209 
and a boycott of Ihe Price Center. 

GRANT: Team 
will use 'protein 
trap' technique 
Continued from page 2 

Since kinesins erve vi tal roles 
in the funclioning of ce ll s, malfunc-
lions often lead to serious diseases. 
One example is fami lia l hyper-
lrophi cc<lrdiolTlyopalhy, which trig-
ge rs heart attacks in )'oung adu lts. 
This di~ordcr siems from a break-
down of Ihe protein myos in , closely 
related to kinesin. 

Kinosins are also respon~i ble fo r 
transporting molccules 10 the ends 
of nerve ce ll s. Failure of the pro-
teins in cases like this can result in 
degenerati ve nerve disorders. 

As described in the three year 
project funded by the NSF grant,the 
UCSD team will use the PAA pro-
tein trap and other new techniques 
to observe and manipulate kinesin 
molecules. Moerner and his associ-
ates ho~ to determine how kinesins 
travel along microtubules in a cell. 

"We' ll try all the various hy-
potheses using novel optical sys-
tems," Goldstein said. "In doing so, 
we hope thi s will help us explain 
how molor proteins work, and how 
they funclion. Perhaps Ihi will tell 
us something surprising about these 
and other proteins."

alking to and from 
class, eating in the 

Price Center or sitting 
in a large lecture hall , 

hundreds to thou ands of 
people may pass by, talk to or sit next to 
you. One in five hundred of them is HIV-
positive. This is just one statistic of many 
that indicate AIDS is real , terrifying and 
cannot be ignored. 

Almost everyone has had some 
education: Human Immune-deficiency 
Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are 
incurable di eases that lead to death; HIV 
is contracted through cOnlact with infected 
bodily fluids that attack T-cells in the 
blood. Eventually the virus develops into 
ALDS. A majority of the American 
population also knows how it can be 
contracted - through blood transfusion 
from infected persons, sharing intravenous 
drug needles and having unprotected sex 
with infected partners. 

What we do not know. or perhaps to 
what we do not pay attention, are the 
casualties of this epidemic . College 
students in particular are unaware of how 
devastating are the stati tics. 

Ian Trowbridge, Professor at the Salk 
Institute, is trying to change this by 

teaching lower- and upper-division 
courses, Biology 36 and 136, respec tively 
- both of which are titled "AIDS: Science 
and Society." 

'There is a fair percentage of people I 
teach who have this idea that they're 
immortal," Trowbridge said. "Students 
know they are doing something that may 
be risky but it's not risky enough that it's 
ever going to affect them directly." 

Trowbridge said this general feeling of 
invincibility is pervasive among youth. 
However, they are not exempt from the 
risk. 

According to the loint United Nations 
Program on HIV/AIDS (UNA IDS) - the 
group responsible for organizing World 
AIDS Day 1996 - every hour, 
somewhere in the world, two teenagers are 
infected with HJY. Consequently, AIDS is 
the leading cause of death for people 
between the ages of 25 and 44, most of 
whom contracted the disease when they 
were 18 to 24 years old. . 

The National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases (NIAlD) said 
that the number of 
youths between the 
ages of 13 and 
19 years 

STORY BY 
ELISABETH KoMAREK, 
GUARDIAN REPORTER 

infected with HIV increased 524 percent 
within the first six months of 1995. 

"Jane," an HIV-posi tive woman 
frequently peaks to groups about the 
disease. She believes education "can save 
people's lives." 

lane attributes the staggering number 
of people infected with H1V - which is 
approximately 40,000-50,000 people a 
year, according to Trowbridge - to a lack 
of knowledge and denial of the disease. 

Trowbridge said most ignorance of 
HIV and AIDS stems from myths about 
the disease. He said that many think HIV is 
limited solely to homosexual men. 

"Being homosexual is irrelevant," 
Trowbridge said. " It 's the fact .that gay 
men have unprotected anal sex [that make 
them more susceptible to contracting the 
virus I." 

He added that 75 percent of the world's 
AIDS patients were infected through 
vaginal intercourse. 

NIALD found that a greater percentage 
of teens infected with AIDS are female 
rather than male. Twenty-five percent of 

infected women in the U.S. are 
between the ages of 13 and 29. 

According to the California 
Department of Health

AIDS: 
An HIV-positive woman 
describes her struggles 
ContInued from .,... 11 
Services, the number of minorities infected 
with HIV and AIDS is steadily increasing. 
Seventy-si}( percent of young women infected 
are Latina or African-American. California's 
African-Americans as a group have the 
highest rate of AIDS infection in the state. 

The Office of AlDS-Epidemiology Branch 
of the California Department of Health 
Services reponed that between 1981 and July 
of 1996 14,942 AIDS 

are infected worldwide. Every year, 40,000 
people across lhe globe die from AIDS or 
AIDS-incurred infections. 

The California Department of Health 
Services estimates that 61,348 Californians 

. have died from AIDS or AIDS-related 
diseases as of July 1996. 

Jane has persQnally known at least a dozen 
women who have died from AIDS, as well as 
her husband. 

Jane contracted the virus as a college 
student from her boyfriend at the time. Upon 
testing herself on a whim. she was shocked to 
discover that she was HIV-positive. 

In 1987, "the only people who had the 

cases were reponed 
among African Americans 
in California. 

"There are six times 
more African-Americans 
infected than there ought 
to be, based on the 
proportional 
representation of 
popu lation, and three 
times more Hispanics," 
Trowbridge said. 

In 1987, Mthe only

virus were drug addicts, 
prostitutes, and gay men," 
Jane said. "When I found 
out. my heart just 
dropped." 

Jane and her boyfriend 
moved in together, 
primarily to take care of 
each other, and eventually 
married. At the time of her 
diagnosis, she and her 
boyfriend were both told 
their tives would end very 
shortly. Kristin Schaefer, an 

employee at Roger & Associates - a public -
relations group working with the California 
Department of Health Services to educate 
people about AIDS - said her company 
focuses on educating minorities. 

According to Schaefer. minorities do not 
realize that they are at risk, due in part to the 
pervasive myth that AIDS i a gay man 's 
disease. She said this makes it more likely 
that minorities would not protect themselves. 

The Centers for Disease Control estimated 
that one out of250 Americans is infected with 
HIV, regardless of age or race. Moreover, one 
in every four of tho e infected is underthe age 
01'22. 

The Office of AIDS at the California 
Department of Health Services estimates that 
in one year, 8.000 Ca lifornians will be 
infected with the virus. Today, approximately 
5,500 Californians - one in 200 - are HIV-
positive. Nationally. the numbers range 
between 650,000 and 900,000. 

Trowbridge said that HIV is a global 
epidemic. Approximately 28 million people 

However, Jane completed college and 
auained her degree. She is proud of her 
accomplishments, given that she is alive 
today and would not have a degree had she 
given up her dreams. 

Jane's husband 's health deteriorated after a 
few years . His T-cel! count was 40 - well 
below the normal blood count of 800 to 1500. 
He contracted several opportunistic 
infection , sustaining himself on 40 pi li s a 
day. He died in 1991 , four years after he had 
first found out he was infected. His wife 
de cribed the process as a painful one. 

"It wa frustrating because it was 0 hard 
to win," Jane said. 

Living with AIDS is difficult, Jane said, 
partly because he cannot "be the person J fc lt 
I was, as far as relationships and dating were 
concerned ." 

Jane dated despite her condition. She to ld 
her prospective dates she was HJV-posi tive. 
Some rejected her, sorne did not. Although 
she was physically intimate with several of

them. she said she never pursued sexual 
relations unless her partner "knew what he 
was gelling into," and never without a 
condom. . 

Jane is currently in a relationship of almost 
two years. Her boyfriend has tested negative. 
and continues to get tested every six month, 
"for peace of mind." 

Jane feels she is II "messenger [responsible 

. 

"It's every man for himself," she added. It 
is the individual's responsibility to be 
informed and to get tested. 

"People designate driver pursuant to 
being informed about the effect of drunk 
driving." Jane said. "Having unprotected sex 
is like getting into a car with a drunk dri ver-
you give up all your control and power." 

She encouraged people to get educated 
through courses and workshops on AIDS and 
safe sex, and also advised others to get te ted. 

Trowbridge said that once a person is 
tested, found negative and is still negative 
after being tested six months later, then she 
is not obligated to discu ss her sexual 

hi story with former fori making people aware 
about HIY and the fact 
that anyone could have it." 
She described herself as 
"asymptomatic" - she 
appears to be healthy. 

"I blend into society 
very well ." she added. 

Jane is working to 
educate others about HJV 
and relevant issues 

"People designate

they know] about

said. "Unprotected

when somebody's already

Tom Hope. Assistant 
Professor at the Salk I nstitute Center for 
AIDS Research in Infectious Diseases 
Laboratory, i currently working to produce a 
video to educate San Diego public-school 
students. 

Hope ' aid education is the major venue to 
prevent thi s epidemic from further advancing. 

"As long as thc individual has some 
understanding of what's going on, what puts 
them at ri sk, what doesn ' t put them at risk, 
what are the consequences of what happens 
when you' re infected with the virus, then they 
can make informed choices, they can make 
responsible choices." Hope said. "It·s really 
i mportanl.. . that they make those choices 
based on fact." 

Jane said that not knowing who is infccted 
is the most 'ignificant contributing factor in 
conlracting the virus. 
. "What you don't want to look at comes 
right in your face." she said. 

Jane warned that people should not expect 
former sex ual partners to inform others if they 
discover they are HIY-positive.

Trowbridge said. 

According to Trowbridge, the economic 
implications of AIDS alone should be enough 
to compel the government to implement 
mandatory education on AIDS and 
prevention . Each AIDS patient requires 
$120.000 in treatment and each opportunisti c 
di sease case costs $20.000 - 30.000 in 
maintenance treatment. He st ressed the 
signifi cance of voting as another means of 
prevention. 

"The disease is managed politically in thi s 
country and one way to further AIDS 
awareness is to vote out local politicians who 
won't let that information get out ," 
Trowbridge said. "A lot of people in political 
po ition don ' t think AIDS is enough of a 
problem to make it an issue." 

Jane stressed the effect ive combinalion of 
education and sexual protection as a means of 
prevention.

comes down to is, do you trust your partner

If you have to accept the

Fall Sports Wrap Up 
The race for the IFC Sports Banner began 

again this fall with tennis. The big match of the tour-
nament featured SAE's number one team , Bryan 
Crape and Andre De Fontaine, and Beta's, Andy 
Damron and Kevin Cohen . Beta jumped out to an 
early lead winning the first seven games but SAE 
made a quick comeback to trail by only one game, 
8-7. The Beta team was able to fight off the late 
charge and won the match 10-7. They went on to 
defeat SAE's second team in the finals 10-3. With 
the combined play of the SAE teams they were able 
to take first place in tennis. Beta finished second 
and four others finished tied for third . 

The next sport was football which was as 
exciting as always, featuring several games which 
came down to the wire . The first semi-final game 
was Beta vs. Sigma Nu. Beta was able to get up 
early with a punt return for a touchdown on their first 
posession and a quick score on their second. 
Sigma Nu railed back in the second half of the game 
but was unable to overtake Beta's lead. The other 
semi-final game was between Sigma Chi and Delta 
Sig. This was physical game which ended up tied 
13-13 at the final whissle. In "California overtime" 
Sigma Chi drove the ball deep into Delta Sig territo-
ry and looked to have the game won . On the last 
play of the game though, Delta Sig. threw up a hail 
marry which was tipped into the hands of one of 

their players who proceded to run for the game 
wining touchdown . Delta sig carried this 
momentum on into the finals where they beat 
Beta21 -13. 

The Fall sports finished up with volleyball . 
The semi-finals featured Sig. Ep. vs. Pi Kapp 
and SAE vs. Sigma Ch i. Sigma Chi was able 

to dispose of SAE in two games and move into the 
finals . Sig Ep and Pi Kapp had a marathon game 
which took nearly one and a half hours. After split-
ting the first two games Pi Kapp was able to pull out 
a 12-10 win in the third game over last years 
champs. The strength of Sigma Chi 's team in the 
finals was too much for Pi Kapp who had to settle for 
second. 

As for the overall standings Sigma Chi is in 
the lead with 200 points. Beta is in second with 165 
and SAE a close third with 150. Sigma Nu, Delta 
Sig and Pi Kapp round out the top five with 140, 130, 
r-----------,and 130 points respectivly.

The race is on and the quest for the 1996-
1997 Panhellenic Sports Banner has begun. With 
the first three sports completed, Delta Gamma has 
jumped out into first place. Tennis started off the 
year with Kappa Alpha Theta capturing the title, fol-
lowed by Tri-Delta. Soon followed the brutal 
games of Pan hellenic flag football. After several 
close and challenging games, Alpha Chi Omega 
placed second and Delta Gamma took first. 
Volleyball finished the quarter, with Delta Gamma 
and A'pha Chi Omega once again reaching the 
finals . These talented teams played a great game 
and Delta Gamma finished the tournament with a 
victory. The winter quarter sports look to be excit-
ing as this competition continues. Next quarters' 
Panhellenic events are, Soccer, Bowling and 
Innertube Waterpolo. -JG

BLOWOUT: 
New England came 
and conquered 
Continued from page 17 
for the home team. 

"We got out to a fasl start. 
turnovers were a big key; we got 
our hands on some balls and gave 
our offen e good field po 'ition," 
Johnson said, who led the Patriots 
with six tackles. "We foc u ed 
specifically on stopping the run and 
(think we did that and forced them 
to throw the ball very, very early. 
We did everything we wanted to 
do." 

Meanwhile, Ihe game continued 
to sour like leftover cranberries for 
the Chargers while the Patriots 
made very few mistakes. Follow-
ing the Pats' third score, the Charg-
ers' Andre Coleman returned the 
ensuing kickofT for a touchdown, 
but had the play called back 
be~au~ of holding. 

. A couple of possessions later, 
Humphries was sacked near the 
end zone and fumbled. The Pats 
defense helped themselves to the 
post-Thanksgiving treat, as defen-
sive end Will ie McGinest pounced 
on the ball for a louchdown. With a 
47-yard fi eld goal tacked on later, 
the Chargers found themselves 
down by 24 as the half came to a 
brulal end. 

The Patriots continued to play 
the big, bad cou in at the Chargers' 
family dinner, elbowing thei r way 
to all the stuffing and gravy tht:y 
desired. On the opening series of 
the second half, Humphries was 
intercepted at the Chargers' 27, 
which quickly led to yet another 
Bledsoe touchdown pass. 

Later in the third quarter, the 
Bolts got bullied some more, when 
Humphries got mashed like Grand-
ma's potatoes by defensive end 
Mike Jones and wa knocked 
senseless. Although he awoke 
moments later, Humphries could 
only wobble to the sidelines and 
spent the night at the hospital. 

With their backs against the 
wa ll all night, the Charger defense 
could rarely muster a stop. Even 
when they forced the Pats 10 punt, 
the special teams botched things 
up. The Patriots fini shed their scor-
ing binge as San Diego wideout 
Brian Still fumbled a third-quarter 
punt that was returned 42 yards for 
a touchdown. 

"We lost to a beller team," line-
backer Junior Seau said. "Three 
integral parts of foo tball were 
played by the New England Patri -
ots. which were special teams, 
offense and defcnse. It wasn't just 
one thing. \I [the losing efTort) was 
the sum of everyone in this locker 
room and we're going to have to 
just bounce back." 

A Iroubled team will indeed 
have to bounce back againsl the 
indomitable Pittsburgh Steelers 
nex t weekend if they hope to make 
the playoffs. Though generous 
hosts at home this evening, thing 
will get no easier as the Chargers 
take to the road. After being basted 
like a turkey on Thanksgiving by 
the playoff-bound Patriols, corner-
back Darrien Gordon spoke the 
obvious. "If we keep playing like 
thi s. we' re not going to make the 
playofT ." 

For the Chargers, that road to 
the post-season does not get easier. 
Trips to Pittsburgh and Chicago are 
on the itinerary, followed by a 
home battle against the best team in 
the NFL - the Denver Broncos. 

For the Patriots they came. they 
saw, and they conquered.

coffee drinks and fresh pastries. I had an iced banesso, 
made with a banana, a shot of espresso, cream, and ice 
all blended up with lots of whipped cream on top. And 
my huge apple muffin was out of this world! It was so 
moist and so stuffed with chunks of apples and walnuts 
that I had the people next to us try it. Bob bad a raspberry 
danish and washed it down with a white mocha, a 
delectible Iitde espresso drink made with white cocoa. 
Ooh La La! After we devoured our snack we perused 
the aisles and found all sorts ofluscious goodies to quench 
our undying hungers. We found fresh Dudley's bread 
ind all kinds of sandwich fixings, pastas and sauces, 
cereals galore, cold drinks including Naked Juices and 
Naked Smoothies, Dole fruit juices, and Arizona Iced

TIP-OFF: Two 
losses at tourney 
Continued from pale 24 
weekend fort he Tritons, who com-
milled 14 more turnovcrs than their 
opponents. 

UCSD opened tournament play 
againsl Division /IJ Wisconsin-
River Falls. Still gelling adjusled 
to tAeir new starting lineup, the 
Tritons struggled 10 find offensi ve 
consislency. Going into the lockcr 
room at halftime, UCSD trailed by 
I I points but still was in conten-
tion for Ihe win. 

The second half proved to be 
disastrous for the treaky Trilons, 
who only managed to shoot 28 
percent from the noor, including a 
horrific I of 14 from behind the 3-
point arc . UCSD could manage 
only 23 points in the final 20 min-
utesofplay and fcllto River-Fa ll s, 

82-63. 
As tough as things seemed for 

the Tritons against their Wiscon-
sin opponents, things only got 
worse as Lanthier's squad squared 
off againsl Christian Heritage in a 
game to decide third place on Sat-
urday. UCSD was matched up

In contrast to their previous 
game, the Tritons came storming 
out of the gates and took control 
early on the offensive end. With

side shooters for UCSD were freed 
up for open looks at the basket. 
Aune put up 24 points and grabbed 
a team-high 13 reboundS bUI 
struggled from the free-throw line, 
converting only 8 of 21 allempts. 
Sharpshooters Thimgan and Wall 
were not abou t to let those open 
shot opportunities pass them by 
and Ihe two led the Tritons into 
halftime up by 13 points. Thimgan 
fini hed with 28 points and Wall 
added 21 points along with six 
assists. 

Bad luck returned in the second 
half, however, as the Tritons ran 
headlong into a rejuvenated Chris-
tian Heritage squad in the second 
half. UCSD struggled to maintain 
its early lead and soon found the 
gap quickly being closed. 

The Tritons could not slow 
Heritage guard Chad Bickley, who 
finished the game with 37 points

and even 3-pointers. 
UCSD slruggled with the fun-

damentals of the game, marked by 
a poor 13 of 29 shooting from the 
free-throw line. Down the stretch, 
the Tritons were unablc to convert 
their Oppo~lunities al Ihe free-
Ihrow line and managed a meager 
36 points for the entire second 
half. Herilage put the game out of 
reach with a Iremendous showing 
coming out ofthc locker room and 
won, 97-84. 

"Our team kind of withered in 
our last two games," injured guard 
Mark Sebeck said "If we win our 
next game, things should turn 
around." Sebeck i oul with a bro-
ken bone in his hand and should be 
back into the lineup in a week.

Continued from peee 24 
cruciate ligament or a 
sprained ankle, the carpet is a 
player's nightmare. And in a 
recent poll of NFL players, 
85 percent said that 'they hate 
playing on the fake stuff. 
Around the league, sentimenl 
favoring Ihe switch from carpet 
to grass has been strong in the 
past couple 
of years - wilnessed by the 
change at Kansas City'S Ar-
rowhead Stadium . Bul cur-
rently,there are 15 teams which 
play on artificial turf. 

For owners, it's a beautiful 
situation. Jerry Jones and com-
pany save millions of dollars 
because they do not have 10 
maintain the fie ld . The costs of 
maintaining a grass field are 
very high, but Ihe carpel ro ll s 
on and off the concrete very 

_ easily . 
Football was meant to be 

played on green grass under a 
blue sky, not on neon-green car-
pet under a big-ass tarp. There 
is nOlhing the players ean do 
but play the game, wherevcr 
it ' held , so it is up to these 
owners 10 take respons ibility.

after a slellar 3-13 campaign 
lasl season. Rich Kotite is a 
bigger baffoon than Barry 
Switzer and the Jets wear green 
uniforms. How much worse can 
it get, you ask? Well, a lot 
worse. 

Take , for example, 
yesterday's debacle at Houston. 
Multi -millionaire free-agenl 
pick-up quarterback Neil 
O'Donnel was sel to relurn to 
the starling line-up after a six-
week absence. So he 's doing

game - making throws and go-
ing through the motions when 
all of a sudden he hurts himself. 
Excuse me!

TOMMIES: St. 
Thomas edges UCSD 
Continued from pce 24 

But similar to last year, the Triton 
could not keep up in the second half, 
being outscored 36-24. Unlike the 
previous collapse, however, this time 
UCSD was still within striking range 
with under five minutes to play before 
the Tommies took flight. Regardless, 
Malone was not happy with her team 's 
performance. 

"I thought we could definitely 
play with them," Malone said. "But 
we let their reputation take us oul of 
it. They were extremely physical 
and aggressive on defense, and we 
played timid." 

She was especially concerned 

The UCSD Guardian SPORTS 2~ 

about the 30 UCSD turnovers com-
mitted. But while Malone was disap-
pointed, one loss isn't throwing her 
into a panic. 

''I'm not planning on changing 
anything," Malone said. "We didn't 
have one good practice all week 
because of a cold that most of the 
girl have passed around, and there 
were also papers to do and midterm 
10 study for." 

There were positive point, like 
enior guard Ci ndy Yamasaki 's 

team-leading 15 points and Tristen 
Teasdale's 10 points off the bench. 
Senior forward Pam Contini led the 
leam wilh eight rebounds, helping 
the Tritons collect more rebound 
than their Minnesota guests. 

Now Malone and her Tritons 
must put this loss behind them, be-

cause while they 
are enjoyi ng a 
long homestand, 
ther:! will be a

On Tuesday, 
Claremont

and they have had

Thcn comes a 
huge Friday night 
game against Point 
Loma. They are a 
larger NAiA pro-
gram, and more im-
portantly, have de-
veloped a "cross-

UCSD. Anything 
can and will happen 
in this series. BUllhe 
Tritons cannot rest 
even after that game 
because on Satur-

THE CYNIC 
SEANRAHIMI 

Instant Replay 
and Hapless Jets 

On a typical Sunday 
afternoon, the hopes of NFL 
squads rest on the decisions 
of old men in black stripes. 
Players collide at high 
speeds, while the aforemen-
tioned zebras attempt to 
accurately make decisions 
based on fractions of inches. 
See anything wrong with this 
picture? 

It's about time for NFL 
commis ioner Paul Tagliabue 
to stick out his neck and do 
something. r am gelling sick 
and tired of seeing old, fat 
men blow call that conse-
quehtly co t teams football 
games. For example, the San 
Diego Chargers were striving 
to make a comeback against 
the New England Patriots last 
night, but the officials got in 
the way. Replays clearly 
howed that wide recei ver 

Charlie Jones made a tremen-
dous catch on a deep pass 
with San Diego trailing 14-7, 
but the Foot Locker imper-
sonators ruled the pass 
incomplete. And on the 
following play, Stan 
Humphries' offering was 
intercepted and the Patriots 
increased t hei r lead to 21 -7. 

If you are a ~ports fan like 
me, you hate to see referees 
affect the outcome of games. 
It pains me to witnes an 
overweight, blind moron 
make a call from the worst 
possible angle. It ' s obvious to 
everyone in lhe stadium that 
he has no clue, but the teams 
live with the decision . 

Why can ' t the NFL follow 
the lead of the National 

Hock~y League? The NHL' 
instant replay system ha 
overturned numerous contro-
versial plays. So why do I 
have to endure the pain of 
watcbing ·tupid calls on a 
weekly basis? 

Here ' what I propose. 
Allow each head coach to 
throw a red flag three times 
for each half of play . Every 
time a coach throws a flag, 
the referees must go the 
sidelines and watch the 
preceding play on a monitor. 

In this formula, the 
coaches can review a contro-
versial call at their own 
discretion, and the flow of the 
game would not be stopped as 
frequently .

An Excruciating 
Loss for UCSD 
PAIN: Starting point guard Adam Libby tore his 
anterior cruciate ligament, ending his season 
By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

When a home team hosts a 
tournament and rolls out the wel-
come mat for oppo ing squads in 
their own gym, the hope i that 
they will be able to pull the 
mat out from under the other 
team on the way to vic-
tory . 

The UCSD men's bas-
ketball team hoped to yank 
the rug out from under its 
guests this past weekend as 
they hosted the II th annual 
Triton Tip-Off Tournament. 
Unfortunately, the guest decided 
to stay like grandparent over the 
holidays:.lhat is, for too long. 

The only way that the Tritons 
got near the mat was when they 
were picking themselves up off of 
it, as the hosts got trampled by the 

University of Wisconsin-River 
Falls and Christian Heritage. 

For UCSD,the bad news started 
early, when the team found out 
that they would be without slart-

ing point guard Adam 
Libhy, who injured hi knee 
in the Tri tons important 84-
81 win over Division III 
rival Occidental College 
last Tuesday. Libby's in-
jury is believed to be a torn 
anterior crutiate ligament, 
which could sideline him 
for the remainderofthe sea-
on . 

Without its starting ball han-
dier, UCSD entered the Triton Tip-
Off knowing certain players would 
need to tep up and take the place 
of their injured teammate. 

"Someone from the bench will 
have to step up," Libby said, "The 

style of play 
might have to 
change a little. 
Defensively, the 
team ' s going to 
have to pick it 
up in the half-
court set."

DEFENSE: In a rematch of last year's playoffs, UCSD suffers ~ repeat defeat against St. Thomas 
By Travis Hili 
Staff Writer 

"OK everybody, go out there, play hard and 
gi ve it your best. And remember, it doesn't matter 
who wins, as long as you have fun." Yeah right. 

Maybe in little league this was 
true, but try to tell that to any 
UCSD athlete and see what hap-
pens. 

Athletes are competitors; they 
need that extra edge. It doesn't 
matter which way you frame it, 
losing hurts. But it happens to 
everybody, and it's what you take 
from losses that can really form 

the character of a team. The champions find out 
what they did wrong and fix it. 

As was bound to happen sooner or later, the 
UCSO women's basketball team suffered its first 
defeat last Saturday at RIMAe. It was e pecially 
difficult, however, because they were coming off 
two huge wins over two of the best teams in 
Division III (Trinity and Concordia) on Che roaJ in 

, Texas. This was supposed to be their triumphant

return home, where Head Coach Judy Malone's 
women would exact revenge on the University of 
St. Thomas, the quad that ended their season by 
eliminating them from last year's playoffs. But 
once again, the ,!ommies proved to be their de-
mon. 

The Tritons knew thi. wouldbeaneventougher 
battle than their first two games in Texas. The 
Tommies would be entering the RIMAC arena 
with the No. I ranking in Division III. But the 
Tritons were hoping that their experience against 
two other highly ranked programs would give 
them an advantage they didn't have in last year's 
contest. 

It did, and it didn't. This time around, the game 
was much closer, but the result was still the same. 
Instead of losing by 24 as they had in the playoffs 
last season, the Tritons only went down by 13,68-
55. It was extremely close in the first half, as 
UCSO's execution on the free- throw line, a 
perfect 9 for 9, and superior 3-point shooting kept 
them in it. The Tritons headed to the locker room 
down by only one point, 32-31 .
