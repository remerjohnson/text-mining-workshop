ATHENS, Greece - Giving a 
sample of the kind of resentment 
President Clinton can expect on 
Friday, more than' 10,000 Greek 
protesters marched in front of the 
U.S. Embassy on Wednesday, 
many carrying banners branding 
Clinton a murderer. 

The noisy demonstration, 
which began at the Polytechnic 
University to commemorate the 
brutal crackdown on student pro-
testers there by the U.S.-support-
ed military dictatorship on Nov. 
17, 1973, is an annual ritual. But

Warner announced on 
Wednesday that it would no 
longer make unregulated dona-
tions to political parties, saying 
such "soft money" contributions 
distort the electoral process and 
sully the givers. 

The company joins a handful 
of other corporations in swearing 
off contributions to the parties,

early to declare the unilateral 
actions a trend.

Speaker Sought By Y2K 
CEREMONY: Dynes offers Council chance at all-campus commencement 
By JENNIFER ICAPUN 
Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council will soon 
begin the process of selecting a 
speaker for this year's all-cam-
pus commencement. Chancel-
lor Robert Dynes granted the 
A.S. Council permission to do 
so on Monday. 

An all-campus commence-
ment will be held on the basis 
that a speaker, approved by 
both students and administra-
tion, is secured by the first 
week in January. 

Bill Cosby, Magic Johnson 
and Nelson Mandela were 

voted the three most desired 
people to speak at the ceremo-
ny in an A.S. Council straw poll 
last Wednesday. The A,S. 
Council will further discuss the 
issue in the coming weeks. 

The issue of whether the all-
campus commencement should 
continue has been debated 
since last spring's poor turnout. 
The primary controversy cen-
ters around whether money 
and effort should be spent to 
support an event that most stu-
dents will not attend. 

Vice Chancellor of External 
Relations Jim Langley said that 
if the students want an all-cam-

pus commencement, the 
administration ' is in full sup-
port. 

"Previous experience would 
suggest that most students and 
their families will opt for col-
lege commencement unless the 
president of the United States is 
our s~aker," he said. "But, if 
most students want ali-univer-
sity commencement, you'll find 
administration fully behind it. 
Why wouldn't we be?" 

Langley said that last year, 
students said they did not nec-
essarily want a celebrity as a

Trophy, 
Antelope 
Missing 
THEFT: Roosevelt offers 
burglars chance to return 
shoe without penalty 
ByLAURENI.COARTNEY 
Staff Writer 

Thieves stole the Watson 
Golden Shoe perpetual trophy 
from the Eleanor Roosevelt 
Administrative building some-
time between sunset last 
Saturday and late afternoon 
Sunday. 

Roosevelt college won the 
Golden Shoe in this year's 
Unolympics, which take place 
during Welcome Week each year. 

The break-in was reported 
Sunday morning. However, the 
Golden Shoe was not noticed as 
missing until Monday morning. 

"I didn't notice that it was 
missing because I assumed that 
the robbery was to steal other 
things, said Barbara Blomgren, 
the Roosevelt business manager 
who noticed that the shoe was 
missing when she found the lock 
to its case lying broken on the 
floor. "It didn't occur to me that 
it might be something symbolic 
like this," . 

The only other object stolen 
was a carved African Antelope 
head that was part of the multi-
ethnic decor of the building. 

Upon suggestion from the 
police, the college will not take 
immediate action. Instead, the 
college instituted a grace period 
running until Dec. 3 in which the 
person or persons who took the 
trophy can return it without pun-
ishment. 

"It will be seen as a prank and 
not a crime until the third," 
Blomgren said. "We' re not look-
ing to punish anybody or ask any 
questions, we just want it back

La Jolla Playhouse to Expand, Fund New Works 
THEATER: 'A Script for the Future' campaign already raised $18 million toward $36 million goal 
By JEFFREY M. BARKER 
Associate News Editor 

In what actor Gregory Peck 
called "a defining moment in 
the history of La Jolla 
Playhouse," the theater 's 
fund raising leaders announced 
goals to raise $36 million, build 
a third stage, create a permanent 
endowment and fund new 
plays at every step of the cre-
ative process. 

Peck, co-founder of the 52-
year-old theater, was on hand 
when current Playhouse offi-
cials celebrated plans to increase 
the number of productions the 

Playhouse offers annually and 
to further develop partnerships 
with UCSD and the San Diego 
community. . 

Leaders of "The Campaign 
for La Jolla Playhouse: A Script 
for the Future" have already 
raised $18 million, much of 
which came from large dona-
tions by Joan and Irwin Jacobs, 
the James S. Copley Foundation 
and Ellen Revelle Eckis. 

A $5 million gift from Joan 
and Irwin Jacobs will go toward 
the construction of a new facili-
ty, the first step in the four-part

THEATER: 
New funds bankroll 
promising writers 
C .... llu .............. l 
campaign. The building, to house 
a 200-seat · "black box" theater, 
rehearsal rooms, classrooms, 
additional shop space and the 
Playhouse's business offices, will 
bear the Jacobs name. 

Two million dollars of the $5 
million gift is contingent upon 
the community's matching that 
$2 million. 

Mobile trailers sit snug 
between the Mandell Weiss 
Theatre and Mandell Weiss 
Forum, behind the Playhouse. 
For years, the Playhouse staff has 
worked from those trailers. 

The new facility - and the 
new staff offices - will replace 
the trailers. 

"Having spent many years in 
a drafty trailer with no plumbing, 
I heartily applaud the effort to 
complete the Mandell Weiss 
Centre so that theater artists and 
staff in coming seaaons have the 
best possible working environ-
ment, n said Des McAnuff, a for-
mer Playhouse artistic director. 

The university donated the 
land to the Playhouse. 

Playhouse officials have 
begun the architect selection 
process and expect to break 
ground late next year. They 
expect to spend $7.5 million on 
the construction. 

A $2 million gift from the 
James S. Copley Foundation 
toward the development of new 
works made possible Chay Yew's 
"Wonderland," produced by the 
Playhouse this fall. The 

Foundation's donation was the 
first toward the Playhouse's 
"Premier Production , Fund," 
designed to allow the Playhou~ 
to maintain full productions of 
work each season. 

Other funds in the 
Playhouse's new effort to sup-port 
the creative process are its New 
Works/New Writer Fund," 

"Youn~ Artists in Action Fund" 
and Education and Family 

"Having spent many 
years in a drafty trailer 
with no plumbing, I 
heartily applaud the effort 
to complete the Mandell 
Weiss Centre so that 
theater artists in coming 
seasons have the best 
possible working 
environment." 

Outreach Fund." 
"The next generation of the-

ater-makers and theater-goers 
needs to be created and devel-
oped," said Ted Cranston, the 
campaign's chair. 

These funds offer monetary 
assistance to aspiring play-
wrights, workshops and readings 
of in-progress works, and out-
reach efforts to the community 
and to local schools. 

Ellen Revelle Eckis, whose 
donation of $1 million is ear-
marked to the "Artistic 
Enhancement fund," said she 

The UCSD Guardian 

believes the theater is a vital 
organ of the community. 

"Among the things my family 
and I appreciate about La Jolla 
Playhouse, besides what appears 
on its two stages, is its outreach to 
young people, many of whom 
would otherwise not experience 
the stimulation of live theater," 
Revelle Eckis said. 

A $10 million permanent 
endowment will keep vital pro-
grams alive, such as the 

Pla~house's outreach efforts. 
Endowment funds will help 

sustain those activities that are 
most valued by the community 
but which generate minimat 
earned income," Cranston said. 

The fourth component of the 
campaign is a $13.5 million fund 
to ensure the theater's operation 
throudt 2002. Theater officials 
said That because ticket sales 
cover only half of the cost to 
produce a show at the 
Playhouse, an annual operations 
fund keeps ticket prices low and 
allows special programs for 
youth and playgoers with spe-
cial needs. 

In past seasons, the Playhouse 
has equipped the theater for 
blind patrons. 

The announcement of the $18 
million already raised starkly 
contrasts with the $1.9 million 
deficit the Playhouse suffered 
less than seven years ago. 

Terrence Dwyer, managing 
director of the theater, took the 
helm of the Playhouse and was 
successful when challenged to 
reduce its budget 

With the planned additions, · 
the Playhouse will have the 
option to produce shows year-
round, as the Old Globe Theatre 
does at its three-theater complex.

Skat ...... Class Keeps 
Students Out Of Trouble 

San Dieguito Academy High School has recently 
implemented a physical education elective teaching 
skateboarding, one of the only high school courses of 
its kind in the country. 

The Guardian would like to compliment the school 
and the organizers of the program for their innovation 
in offering activities for high school students. Too 
often, schools serve to suppress skateboarding and 
other "fringe" sports that give teenagers positive 
activities to participate in after school. In spite of 
many people's perception of skateboarders as miscre-
ants and delinquents, programs like this one give stu-
dents a constructive outlet for their spare time that 
doesn't involve crime or drugs. 

The failure of education is often cited as the cause 
of criminal activity in young people, but experiences 
outside the classroom contribute greatly to the moral . 
development of young people. By offering an alter-
native to gangs and violence, San Dieguito has made 
a strong commitment to the personal growth of the 
participants of the class, as well as giving these stu-
dents an opportunity to practice the sport they love. 

Skateboarders have a special connection with 
UCSD, which is regarded by many as one of San 
Diego's premiere skating locations. Perhaps now that 
area skaters are starting to receive some basic 
instruction, they won't eat it quite so badly when 
they make -the 1e'rp 1'I'mn d'ie skate park to the more 
difficult stairways and rails of the UCSD campus. 

UC. Volunteer Requirement 
Would Benenl Students 

Last Thursday, Gov. Davis approached UC 
Berkeley officials to discuss his proposal to pass leg-
islation that would require students of the University 
of California, as well as students of California State 
Universities, to complete a community service 
requirement prior to graduation. 

The Guardian feels that such a requirement wouJd 
. be beneficial to ~ otherwise apathetic student p0pula-

tion of the public universities in this stale. The stale of 
California partially subsidizes our education and it is 
only fitting that the students who benefit from this 
state-funded education should give back to the com-
munity. Too much of UCSD's curriculum focuses on 
global issues when problems in our bwn backyards 
have yet to be resolved. Thurgood Marshall College 
already has community service as an elective in its gen· 
eral education requirements, and the creation of a cam-
pus-wide requirement is the next logical step. 

Change often begins with the individual. The 
University of California should not be teaching stu-
dents only abstract theory but should also be giving 
them practical experience for the real world. 
Community service does this. Issues of urban plight 
make more sense when it can be experienced ftrst hand. 
In the process of helping others, students will learn a 
little about themselves and about their place in the 
world.

Afghan Nuclear ""eat .........

Editor: 
In the article "Pakistani 

Coup Debated" (Nov. 11) your 
author writes, "She [Barbara 
Walter) said that the United 
States has more than just 
Pakistan's social and economic 
health to consider: Pakistan 
shares an 1,800-mile border 
with Afghanistan, a country 
that also possesses nuclear 
weapons, and is also in a poor 
state of affairs socially and eco-
nomically." 

As an attendee of this debate, 
and an informed student on the 
geopolitical nature of the region, 
I find this statement to be untrue 
on two counts - neither did 
Walter say, nor is it true, that 
Afghanistan possesses nuclear 
weapons.

plainly requests at the end of her 
commentary that no one should 
"reduce [her) beliefs, or those of 
any other religion, to. a cultural 
phenomenon." 

According to Webster's New 
American Dictionary, culture is 
defined as "the customary 
beliefs, social forms and materi-

provide an opportunity for

may be, in an open forum 
where hatred, intorerance and 
c1osed-mindedness are left at 
the door. 

In order to build anticipation 
for the event, the original plan 
was to focus on a different reli-

, gion each day of the week and 
then put the major emphasis on 
the open forum, which all reli-
gious affiliations were welcome 
to participate in. 

The Logistics Committee was 
assigned the task of inviting all 
religious committees on campus 
to represent themselves at this 
forum and participate. The 
forum was to be set up as fol-
lows: Attendees were to write 
'down questions for a particular 
religion and then drop them in a 
box, where the questions-w~ to 

be drawn out by a mediator 
whose main jobs were 1) to ask 
the question and 2) to weed. out 
any questions that seemed inap-
propriate. Then, the representa-
tive of that particular religion 
was to address the question. If 
there was no representative for 
that religion present, the ques-
tion was to be skipped. This was 
to be the format of the open 
forum. 

Regarding the e-mail that 
Castle referred to, ( would like 
to address the fact that this was 
an e-mail sent out by Jhe 
Logistics Committee meant only 
for active CAN members that 
were fully aware of the format of 
the event regarding the decision 
on whether any religions were 
to be covered during the week 
before the actual forum. Less 
than three days after that e-mail 
was sent out, the CAN decided' 
at its weekly meeting not to pre-
cede the open forum with the 
coverage of any particular reli-
gion, in order to avoid offending 
any religiously affiliated group 
on campus. 

The purpose of this event 
was, and still is, to encompass as 
many religions as possible. 

On a final note, I would like 
to address the fact that there are 
many definitions of culture. The 
CAN at Revelle College agrees 
with Webster 's definition that 
culture is "the customary beliefs, 
social forms, and material traits 
of a racial, RELIGIOUS or social 
group." 

This encompasses many 
things - personal testimonies to 
past experiences and beliefs, cui-
sine, dress, customs and history

6 OPINION The UCSD Ouudian 

Vegetarianism Ir.nclis a Sign of a Sick Society 
COMMENTARY: Lifestyle is unnatural, lends too much power to animals and won't make you thin 

It;.:~ " SlOP Thal/ • BERTRAND AN 
All of my friends have gone 

mad . The evidence of this lies in 
front of me even as I write this 
- a plate of bean sprouts, pea 
pods and mushrooms. This is 
my roommate's sick and twist-
ed idea of dinner. I mean, I'm all 
for seeing baby vegetables siz-
zle and die in a frying pan, but 
I'd .much rather see a slaugh-
tered baby chicken wrapped up 
in packaging that says Cajun 
McChicken after living in a 
crowded, filthy warehouse. 

U.S. federal standards for 
slaughter say that all animals 
should be fully stunned before 
their throats are slit. Quite 
frankly this is one of the stupid-
est victories the animal rights 
groups have won that I have 
ever heard of. Imagine spending 
your whole life lobbying for a 
euphoric death for chickens. I 
think it's probably safe to say 
that 99 percent of all the humans 
that die in the world do not enjoy 

a euphoric death, so whal's so 
damn special about chickens? 
Because someone's going to 
process their bodies into neat lit-
tle frozen dinners? At least we're 
recycling them. 

II's not as if a chicken's life is 
all that bad to begin with. 
Chickens don't have to take 
physics or MMW. They've never 
gone to the DMV. There isn't a 
great deal of stress in a chicken's 
life. The three big questions are: 
"When am I going to be fed?", 
"What's the deal with those 
boxes with the golden arches on 
them?" and "What the hell hap-
pened to Uncle Billy?" 

Natalie Portman, Albert 
Einstein and Ricki Lake. What 
do these people all have in com-
mon? They're all vegetarians. 
Fat lot of good it did for Ricki 
Lake. If you're considering 
becoming a vegetarian for 
health reasons, take a good, 
long, hard . look at Ricki Lake. 
I'd like to give major props to 
the cameraman of that show for 
managing to fit her all on one 
screen. 

Vegetarianism isn't the 
answer to losing weight. I'll tell 
you the answer right now -

THE 
PRINCETON 
REVIEW 

* MeAT January 9 

Stop eating! No infomercial 
scams, no diet charts, no shakes 
that you drink for lunch - just 
stop eating! 

Lately I've been hearing 
quite a bit about a turkey-free 
Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving 
without turkey is like a bagel 
without cream cheese. Why? 
Why would you do that? It 
doesn't make any sense at all. 
Do you know what 1 do for 
Thanksgiving? I go to Ralph's, 
and I buy $100 in groceries so I 
can get my free frozen turkey. 
Then I head down to my local 
bowling alley and slide it down 
the lanes. 

Turkey bowling is a relatively 
new sport that began just a few 
years ago, but it is already wan-
ing in popularity because of a 
few animal rights activists. I 
wish they would just go back to 
protesting fur coats and green 
dresses and stop ruining good, 
clean fun. 

I really don't think vegetari-
anism existed prior to 1950. I'm 
sure there were vegetarians here 
and there, but most of them were 
probably closet vegetarians. The 
only ones that were really open 
about it were cows. The main 

reason vegetarianism didn't exist 
was because society really didn't 
care. 

We didn't have the resources 
to care. There was no Jamba 
Juice. People didn't do shots of 
wheat grass. Salad wasn't an 
entree. I know, it's scary to 
think about life without 
Starbucks, Jamba Juice and 
Kinkos, so I'll bring the topic 
back to 1999. 

Suddenly we care about 
everything. Save the ozone 
larer. Save the dolphins. Save 
al the cute animals. Hell, while 
we're at it, let's save the animals 
that aren't cute, like laboratory 
rats. Save the carrots too, 
because carrots also have feel-
ings. 

This is progress? 
Something is very wrong in a 

society where beef isn't what's 
• for dinner. It's like a warning 

beacon. I think we all need to 
take a step back and ask our-
selves, does any of this make 
sense? If I'm fat and I eat only 
tofu and rice cakes for a month, 
will I still be fat? Yes, you'll just 
be a fat vegetarian. Like Ricki 
Lake.

than women and therefore get 
less selection. But, we would 
shop more if prices were lower. 
We would care more and dress 
nicer if women didn't assume we 
were gay every time we did. 

When it comes to fashion, men 
have no individuality. It's every-
one in khakis. In the real world, 
we're forced to wear suits; in col-
lege there's a bit larger range, but 
nothing compared to that afford-
ed women. If a woman wears 
sweats to class, she's relaxed. If a 
guy wears sweats he's a slob. If a 
woman wears a nice dress suit, 
she's determined, if a guy wears 
something dressy, he's trying too 
hard. 

Women argue that men don't 
know how to dress, that we have 
no style. False. Men have a sense 
of style, but it is censored by 
stores that push conformity and 
women who judge us too harshly 
for what we wear. 

And before women get back to 
complaining that their clothes 
don't accentuate what they have, 
at least their clothes are made to 
do so.

Iraq Bolsters Military Strength GREECE: Mock lynching of 
Clinton delayed visit 

House to postpone and scale 
down a two-day visit. 

The Greek government, 
WASHINGTON The 

Pentagon's senior intellige!1ce 
officer said Wednesday that Iraq 
had begun to rebuild military 
installations that the United 
States and Britain destroyed last 
December and that he could not 
rule out the possibility that 
President Saddam Hussein had 
resumed building chemical or 
biological weapons. 

Vice Admiral Thomas R. 
Wilson, the director of the 
Defense Intelligence Agency, 
said that U.S. intelligence offi-
cials continue to monitor Iraq 
closely but that it was easy to 
hide weapons production 
inside legitimate commercial 
factories. 

"I can' t say authoritatively 
there is no work going on," he 
said in an interview with 
reporters at the Pentagon on 
Wednesday. "In fact, we assume 
that there is." 

Wilson's assessment under-
scored the Clinton administra-

Catholic Bishops Want to 
Certify Theology Professors 

WASHINGTON The 
nation's Catholic bishops 'voted 
overwhelmingly Wednesday to 
require theology professors at 
Cathol ic colleges and universities 
to obtain certification from their 
bishops declaring that what they 
teach is "authentic Catholic doc-
trine." 

The requirement that theolo-
gians obtain a "mandatum," or 
mandate, emerged at the meeting 
of the National Conference of 
Catholic Bishops as the most con-
troversial element in a broad 
statement about what the rela-
tions should be between the 
church and America's more than 
230 Catholic institutions of higher 
education. 

The document, which has 
been under discussion for nearly 
a decade and has undergone two 
major revisions, states that 
Catholic colleges and universities 
are full y autonomous and enjoy 
academic freedom, but that their 
presidents should be Catholics,

Continued from page 1 
Cable ews Network, Wa rner 
Bros. and TIme magazine, among 
other prope rties, has given 
roughly $1 million to the 
Republican and Democra tic par-
ties in each of the last two elec-
tions.

soft money has been used for

Although supporters of the 
document said they believed it 
would not be unnecessarily intru-
sive, it appears likely to generate 
tension at many Catholic univer-
sities, which enroll about 670,000 
students. 

The document now goes to 
Rome for approval, which is 
expected, given that it was 
revised to incorporate a more 
legalistic approach to the relation-
ship between bishops and univer-
sities, which the Vatican had 
asked for in 1996, when it sent 
back an earlier version. 

In its broadest sense, the doc-
ument, titled "Ex Corde 
Ecclesiae" (a Latin phrase mean-
ing, "From the Heart of the 
Church") represents the bish-
ops' response to the secularizing 
forces at American Catholic uni-
versities, which some conserva-
tive critics say have moved 
away. from their original mis-
sion.

voluntary contributions from 
employees to make donations to 
ind ividual candidates. 

The memo referred to the 
company's "special responsibili-
ty" torrovide full and fair cover-
age 0 politics, an acknowledg-
ment that many in the newsgatn-
ering side of the company were 
uncomfortable with the parent 
corporation's political largess. 

The situation is analogous at 
other major television companies 
that are owned by conglomerates 
wi th broad interests and big 
politica l budgets. General 
Electric, which owns NBC and 
the Wa lt Disney Co., which owns 
ABC, are substantial contributors 
to parties and candidates. 
Viacom, the parent of CBS, gives 
vi rtually no money to the parties, 
but its polit ical action committee 
contributes sizable sums to ca'n-
didates.

Gulf War in 1991 and during 
NATO's air war against 
Yugoslavia, China has begun 
actively seeking advanced air-
craft, missiles and other 
weapons, he said. 

"They have clearly made that 
an economic priority," he said. 
And as China's economy 
expands, "it will become more 
significant in the future." 

Last week, U.S. officials dis-
closed that the administration 
and the Pentagon had raised 
serious objections to Israel's deci-
sion to sell China a sophisticated, 
$250 million radar jet similar to 
U.S. Awacs, fearing that the tech-
nology would increase China's 
ability to threaten Taiwan. 

Wilson said that in his esti-
mate, China still lacked the abil-
ity to make an all-out attac.k on 
Taiwan because of its weakness 
in transporting ' significant 
amounts of heavy weapons long 
distances. But he added, "They

stronger regional or greater than

High-lechers Recruit Overtime 
SAN FRANCISCO - The 

managers at Vivid Studios, a 
Web site consulting firm here, 
are accustomed to calls from 
employment recruiters trying to 
poach their technical staff. But 
the day a suitor telephoned look-
ing for Nevil was a new low. 

Vivid's receptionist assured 
the recruiter that it would be dif-
ficult to put Nevil on the line. 
And with good reason. Nevil is a 
black Labrador retriever. 

Thanks to the booming tech-
nology-based economy, compa-
nies' 'ong-standinf scramble for 
qualified technica workers has 
taken on an air of desperation 
lately. A severe shortage of engi-
neers who design hardware and 
software and create Web pages 
has led companies and their 
recruiters to try all sorts of tricks, 
like the Nevil-seeking entrepre-
neur who called each name list-
ed on Vivid Studio's Web site. 

Recruiters are known to send 
e-mail to all the engineers at a 
company, offering to better their 
existing salaries. At dawn, 
recruiters scour Internet job-

placement services to plumb the 
most recently posted resumes 
before a competitor makes con-
tact. At restaurants, they pull 
business cards from fish bowls 
where engineers had placed the 
cards hoping to get a free lunch, 
not a job offer. 

"I was going to a funeral 
recently, and a friend said, 'Don't 
recruit,' and I said, 'Yeah, I won't 
do it,'" said Noelle Tardieu, a 
recruiter who works under con-
tract for Silicon Valley compa-
nies. Weddings are another mat-
ter: Ms. Tardieu says she reads 
the marriage announcements in 
the newspaper to find names and 
titles of prospective recruits. 

So it follows that the heavily 
courted engineers and other 
technology-savvy employees are 
cashing in. Salaries in specific, 
high-demand areas, like Web 
site programming and develop-
ment, have gone up 18 to 20 per-
cent in the last year, said Eric 
Campbell, vice president for 
human relations at Docent Inc. 
of Mountain View, Calif., which 
makes software for corporate 

training. 
"We wind up, six months 

after we hire an engineer, having 
to fight off offers for that same 
engineer for more money," he 
said. "It's become a very preda-
tory environment." 

One big change in recent 
years !s the extent to which stock 
options have become part of the 
package. Fifty percent of junior 
technical employees now have 
stock options, up from 35 per-
cent three years ago. 

To seal deals, recruiters offer 
candidates overseas airline tick-
ets, ramp up vacation time to 
four or five weeks from the 
usual two weeks for starting 
employees or toss in 11 th-hour 
signing bonuses that can range 
from $5,000 to S20,OOO. . 

Other perquisites now seem 
commonplace: Employees can 
redesign offices or cubicles, 
bring pets to work, work at 
home and dress casually - even 
at interviews.

. IRS Investigators Concerned as They 
Become Targets of Investigations 

Urged by Congress to get 
tough on abuse of taxpayers, a 
new team of Treasury agents 
plans a sharp increase in investi-
gations of Internal. Revenue 
Service employees for miscon-
duct - anything from harassing 
taxpayers to theft. 

Indeed, the number of cases 
expected to be opened against 
IRS employees will soon nearly 
equal the number of cases 
against Americans suspected of 
tax crimes. 

The new Treasury inspector 
general for tax affairs has set a 
goal for the fiscal year that 
began last month of increasing 
by half the number of IRS work-
ers who will be investigated, 
and he plans to increase the goal 
by at least 25 percent more th(! 
following year. 

The IRS goal has stirred wor-
ries even within the inspector 

general's own staff that investiga-
tors are being forced to search for 
far more misdeeds than may exist, 
will waste time on trivia and will 
be pressured to trump up cases. 

IRS managers and t!nion 
leaders say the intensified 
scrutiny will distract many IRS 
agents as they defend them-
selves, making the agency less 
potent in pursuing tax cheats. 
Such distractions, following 
years of cuts by Congress in the 
ranks of auditors and tax collec-
tors, are one reason the IRS 
plans to slash audit rates by a 
third next year. 

The cuts are coming even as a 
growing number of Americans 
are using aggressive tactics to 
avoid paying taxes. Some are 
taking advantage of new rules 
intended to protect taxpayers 
from overzealous IRS workers 
and others are betting that with 

a shortage of auditors and col-
lectors, no one will pursue them. 

But supporters of the 
stepped-up efforts say they are 
important to prevent abuses by 
IRS agents. "The intention of the 
new office and the new law is 
not a witch hunt, but to ensure 
that IRS employees and taxpay-
ers are treated civilly and that 
problems are reviewed by an 
independent oversight entity," 
said Sen. William Roth Jr., R-
Del., who sponsored legislation 
that created the inspector gener-
al 's office last year. . 

If the goals are met, nearly 
one in 28 IRS employees will be 
investigated in the next fiscal 
year for suspected misconduct 
- anything from harassing tax-
payers to theft.

"We can't use the low turnout 
of last year, but neither can we 
use the first year when Clinton

Muir senior Senator Guy 
Berger questioned the importance 
of all-campus commencement. He 
brought up possible problems of 
time, congestion around campus 
and lack of individual recognition 
in the ceremony. 

"Basically it's just about sit-
ting around listening to speech-

do this, and I don't think this is 
wha t graduation is all about."

"To be honest, I couldn' t

BOSTON, Mass. - More than 
200,000 people in the United 
States might die next winter due 
to a major flu pandemic, predict 
researchers at the Center for 
Disease Control in Atlanta, Ga. 

Each winter influenza kills 
around 20,000 Americans, most of 
whom are over the age of 65. The 
United States experienced pan-
demics of the virus in 1918, 1957 
and 1968, said lead disease con-
trol researcher Martin Meltzer. 

Meltzer and the Center predict 
another pandemiC for next winter 
that could kill between 89,000 
and 207,000 Americans. 

"Another pandemic is likely, if 
not inevitable," Meltzer wrote in a 
research paper. He stated that 
hWth officials need to plan ahead. 

The Center recommends 
October to mid-November as the 
best time to conduct annual vac-
cination campaigns, a measure

SAN DIEGO, Calif. - The 
Student Environmental Action 
CoalitionJicketed the entrance to 
Sea Wor! on Sunday, protesting 
what it calls the exploitation of 
marine mammals at the park. The 
San Diego State University group 
also called for Corky, the oldest 
surviving killer whale in captivi-
ty, to be set free. 

Corky has been in captivity 
for 27 years. 

Thirteen of the group's memo 
bers protested, wearing signs that 
read "Education Not 
Exploitation" and "Beer Money 
and Whale Jail Equals Profit." 

"Sea World should be preserv-
ing the wild instead of enslaving 
these animals," said the group's 
President Keli Balo. 

That is exactly what the park 
does, said Bob Tucker, Sea 
World's director of public rela-
tions. He said the park rescues 
and releases 400 stranded, sick or 
injured marine animals each yea r. 

The protesters said they object 
to Anheuser Bush owning Sea 
World, saying that a beer compa-
ny does not have education as its 
goa/. Captivity cuts an orca's life 
by as much as 60 years, according 
to People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals. 

Tucker said Sea World's ani-
mals receive the highest standard 
of care from a state-of-the-art 
medical facility where a veteri-
narian examines them daily. He 
added that the animals at Sea 
World don't have to worry about 
predators, diseases or where their 
next meal will come from.

The latest installment to the James Bond 
saga reaches the silver screen Friday with 

a dazzling array oj actinn and effects 

Admit it, every guy wants to be James Bond, and Pierce Brosnan gets the fantasy element of 007 just about right: the way he runs, 
the ways he looks at women, the 
way he leaps out of a lowering 
skyscraper, briefcase in hand . 
Brosnan delivers his greatest per-
formance yet as superspy James 
Bond In "The World is N9t 
Enough:' but it's the strong sup-
porting cast that makes the filin 
the best James Bond movie in a 
decade. 

~hie Marceau ("Brave-
heart ) and Robert Carlyle ("The 

Full Monty") portray some of the 
most memorable Bond villains to 
date. Carlyle is Renard, a mad-
man out to dominate the world's 
oil supply. His uniqueness: He 
has a bullet lodged in his brain as 
the result of a botched hit. The 
bullet prevents him from feeling 
pain and eventually will con-
sume him. making Renard a sui-
'cidal loose cannon. Carlyle 
proves to be a more than formi-
dable opponent for Bond iri that 
he matcnes 0Cfl wit for wit, mus-
cle for muscle. He doesn't ~ly on

Over the span oj the past 37 years, 
Bpnd films hilve become a staple of the 
American action movie genre 

From ski SIO~ to casi-nos, from airplanes to bullet trains, from the depths of the ocean to 
the inside of a volcano, nobody 
does it better than Bond ... James 
Bond, 0Cfl with a license to kill. 
For almost 40 la:'rs, this British 
superspy has led audiences 
across the globe, raking in bil-
lions of dollars through 18 films, 
constituting the longest running 
film series ever. 

. With this week's premiere of 
Bond 19: "The World is Not 
Enough," legions of die-hard 
fans and new fans alike will see if 

007 has what it takes to ease into 
the next century ... shaken, but 
not stirred. 

Like many great movies, the 
James Bond legacy evolved out of 
a series of novels. The late Ian 
Fleming, whose books were 
adored by President John F. 
Kennedy, envisioned James Bond 
not as a dashing superhero, but 
rather as a clever and resourceful 
spy, rough around the edges. Pro-

'Story' Sequel Lives Up to Predecessor 
Tom Hanks and Tim Allen lead a stellar returning cast of voice actors in Pixar Animation's 'Toy Story 2' 
By NICHOLAS RUNCO 
Senior Staff Writer 

In a mo vie market ridd led 
with overused effects that have 
no purpo e other than to flex the 
studios' technical muscle, it's 
encou raging to sec a movie that 
uses that muscle because it's 
approp riate. Granted "Toy tory 
2" is a sequel, and therefore not .l 
completely original concept, bu t 
the film's writer John Lasseter 
tlil manages to crea te n very 

clever experience complemented 
by .the use of computer anima-
tion. 

Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz 
Light year (Tim Allen) lead the 
same group of highly ' conscious 
toys that appeared in the first 
film, including Mr. Potato Head 
(Don Rickles), Slinky Dog Uim 
Varney), Hamm Uohn Ratzen-
burger) and Bo Peep· (Annie 
Potts), who live together in the 
bedroom of a small boy named 
Andy. 

The film begins exactly where 
"Toy Story" left off, when the 
toys' owner Andy is preparing to 
go off to cowboy camp. Around 
this time, Andy's mom (Laurie 
Metcalf) decides to have a yard 
sale, at which Woody is stolen by 
a very recognizable AI, of AI 's Toy 
Bam (Wayne Knight). When it is 
discovered who stole Woody, the 
toys decide to mount a rescue 
operation for their friend and 
unofficial leader. 

The toys' exploits take them 
through the beautifully created 
"real world." The talents of the 
film's animators and 3D modelers

shines with skillfully recreated 
lighting and detail, at times pho-
toreal, created by the award-win-
ning Pixar Studios. The sound to 
accompany the visuals were no 

less impressive under the guid-
ance of sound designer Gary Ryd-
strom ("Star Wars," "Jurassic 
Park," "The Thin Red Line"). 
Some of the effects were lifted 

straight from "Star Wars" as an 
audible gag. . 

One of the most memorable 
segments in the film, a clue-hunt-
ing expedition through the aisles 

of a toy store, exposes the toys to 
an overwhelming dose of their 
own world. They are introduced

LEGEND: 
Many actors produced 
many different Bonds 

for the silver screen, resulting in 
the first three and best Bond 
films, "Dr. No," "From Russia 
with Love" and "Goldfinger." 

Played by the legendary and 
commanding Sean Connery, Bond 
was a man of danger, a man who 
could kill anyone, or get killed at 
any time. 

Connery's Bond was an agent 
who relied less on gadgets and 
more on his wits. In "From Russia 
with Love," Bond seduces a girl in 
order to help him steal a decoding 
device. He then slaps her around, 
avenges a friend's murder and 
kills his enemies after teetering on 
the brink of death. Throughout 
the film, Bond proceeds in a cold, 
calculated manner. He is a man on 
a mission, for Queen and country, 

~hose only objective is to succeed 
at all costs. His only real gadget in 
the film is a briefcase fined with 
tear gas, a knife and a folded up 
rifle. The gadget and action craze 
really took off with NGoldfinger" 
and "Thunderball." 

The next two or three films 
focused on making Bond into the 
world's undisputed superhero. 
The plots grew bigger and bigger,

some would claim patented, the 
action movie one-liner. For those 
of you unfamiliar with this con-
cept, a one-liner is something a 
hero says after doing something 
bad to the enemy. For example, 
Bond fires a spear into a thug's 
chest and mutters the line HI think 
he got the point." Audiences 
remain mixed even today 
whether the one-liner is truly 

clever or terribly distracting. 
After Connery made five films 

as Bond, he bowed out and little-
known Australian model George 
Lazenby was cast as 007 in one of 
the beSt Bond films: "On Her 
Majesty's Secret Service." In this,

tures, Bond falls in love while

By JUSTIN BOGGS 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

Last Friday night the DJs and Vinylphiles 
Club brought some life to the sleepy campus of 
UCSD with "Trademark" style. The event 
brought 500 people together for a night of 
danci ng and musical enjoyment. 

osmo, a DJ from Chicago, along with 
seven hometown DJs perfo'rmed ilt the event 
held at Porter's Pub between 8 p.m. and 2 iI .m. 

The Pub was divided into musicill regions. 
The inside area featured House and Trance 
tyles, whereas tlte outside area housed drum 

'n' bass and breakbeat styles. Each delivered a 
wide array of mUSical styles for participants to 
enjoy. 

Many "breakers," people who perform a 
updated version of breilkdancing, showed off 
their moves in the drum 'n' bas area. The 
crowd danced into the early morning hours, 
fueled by music and the amazmgly pleasant 
atmosphere. 

Nosmo, representing Balance Productions, 
headlined the event and played from 11 p.m.

***" To witnees a Goldfinger show 
live is to witness something truly 
special. One of the best live bands 
of any musical genre, Goldfinger 
.delivers a unique blend of 
ska/pop/punk with extreme 
intensity from the moment they 
walk on stage until the crowd cof-
lapses from exhaustion. You see, 
Goldfinger does not sleep. 

It was back in March of 1996 
that Goldfinger first burst onto 
the music scene with their self-
titled LP and the smash single 
"Here in Your Bedroom." With 
the help of radio airplay and 
MTV, the band ~an a whirl-
wind tour of 382 Shows in 365 
days. (Wow! Do the math on that 
one .... ) Goldfinger was just as 
responsible for the surge of popu-
larity of punk and ska as was No 
Doubt, paving the way for future 
hopefuls like Blink 182 and 
Unwritten Law. 

In September of 1997, the band 
released its second album, Hang-
ups. With less punk and more pop 
and ska, the album, ironically, 
had little mainstream success. Yet 
the band still found its way onto 
MTV with ''This Lonely Place." A 
parody of the movie "Alien," the 
video was one of the funniest to 
hit MTV in recent years. Howev-
er, both the video and song qui(:k-
Iy disappeared from airplay. 
(Maybe less touring played a part 
in this.) Strangely enough, the 
second album was still as success-
ful as the first. 

Since Hang-ups, Goldfinger 
have kept busy recordinJt original 
music for soundtraoo like 
"American Pie," "The Waterboy" 
and "Baseketball," to name a few. 

Now, with their long-awaited 
third album due out in January of 
2000, it is only fitting that one of 
the best live bands around release 
a "live" album to tide its fans over 
in the meantime. 

On Nov. 9, 1999 the band 
released Dtlrrin's Coconut Ass -
Uvt from 0rrrIlJuI. Music purists 
beware! This is an entire album of 
covers. Well-done covers at that. 

The album includes renditions 
of songs by The Cure, Joe Jackson, 
Bad Company, The Specials, The 
Who, Peter Tosh, The Buzzcocks 
and The Police, making it a fun 
listen. Pay special attention to 
covers of Bad Company's "Feel 
Like Making Love" and a version 
of The Cure's "Just Like Heaven" 
that will compel listeners to 
scream its lyrics, even in public 
places. 

All eight tracks are done with 
the high energy that is Goldfin-
ger's signature, and a few also 
include a !ight hom section from 
the Skeletones. 

The album was recorded so 
well it's hard to tell that it's a 
"live" album. The absence of 
crowd noise really takes awaY' 
from the feel that most other live 
albums have. Th~ only indication 
that the album is "live" is a few 
botched lyrics by lead singer John 
Feldman. 

Overall, this is a well-done 
album with eight great covers 
that are in good hands with 
-Goldfinger." The CD cover 
alone deserves a half star for orig-
inality. .

*** Are you out there in CD Land 
lookinx for a CD that will make 
your lIesh creep? Probably not, 
but if you are, tfus is it. 

The latest project from Neuro-
sis, Timts of Gr«t, demonstrates 
that they are the epitome of the 
anti-trend, which is hard to be in 
this day and age. Every album to 
date from Neurosis has been dif-
ferent and hard to place in a cer-
tain metal genre slot. The band 
conjured up the strangest brew 
with this CD, filled with an eerie 
mixture of cold, dark lyrics of 
fear, pain and loneliness. 

Times ofCrfICt continues where 
all their other albums left off, 
quenching the thirst of the metal-
minded fans. Bagpipes, horns 
and haunting strings add a differ-
ent twist to their latest venture, 
mixing with the typical atmos-
phere Neurosis is known to cre-
ate. 

Reaching into the depths of 
your soul, they grab your heart, 
rip it out and reave it as a bloody 
pulp on the floor. Doesn't sound 
appetizing? Grab a copy of the 
CO and experience the dark gore 
on your own time, and you may 
come to appreciate it. 

Song titles like "Under The 
Surface," "The Last You'll Know," 
"The Doorway" (a killer track, 
~cked with heavy guitar riffs), 
Suspended In Light" and 

"Descent" (adding a little Scottish 
action) speak for themselves, 
showing that the versatile Neuro-
sis can affect your mind, whether 
it be day or in "the darkness of 
midnight." 

It's good to know that a band 
still exists that can' t be catego-
rized under a specific genre and 
can still incorporate mind-~­
gling lyrics into thrashy riffs. 
Fans will await Neurosis' next 
project with open minds and 
bleeding ears.

**** In the past, the Charlatans 
were accused of writing "jam-
rooted half songs." However, 
with the debut of their latest 
album, Us /DId Us Only, audi-
ences can give nothing but 
praise. This newfound accep-
tance proves that the Charlatans 
believe in the redemption of rock 
and roll. 

Buoyed, no doubt, by the near-
ly double-platinum status of 
Mtltinf. Pot (a 1998 "Best Of" 
album, the group returns with its 
best album to date. Us /DId Us 
Only is a mix between the Zep-
pelin-era HOIISeS of tM Holy, sprin-
kled with the Bealles and a dash 
of the Rolling Stones. It remains 
the epitome of the musical genre

"Britpop." 
In comparison to their previ-

ous albums, this one is more mel-
low and reserved. The track "I 
Don't Care Where You Live" is 
filled to the brim with "honky 
tonk" piano chords, proving that 
all the uppity fun has not 
escaped through their fingers. All 
their songs make listeners want 
to smile and be happy that 
they're alive. That's powerful 
music! 

-My Beautiful Friend" is a 
creeping, funky song, with singer 
Tom Burgess' melodramatic 
crooning and sensitive lyrics 
wooing all his listeners. The 
appropriately titled "Senses" was 
written in tribute to the ghost of 
their late keyboardist, Rob 
Collins, who revisits Burgess as 
the "sweet black angel laughing 
on my shoulder." 

Out of nowhere, the Charla-
tans came, they saw and they 
conquered. In the process, 
they've won at least one more 
metal fan over to the sugar-coat-
ed land of Britpop.

American Made Music to Strip By

* Take a Rob Zombie CD, make 

remixes of all the songs, smack a 
seductively posed girl on the 
cover, and what do you get? The 
sorriest excuse for a CD since the 
last Backstreet Boys album. 

American MDde Music To Strip 
By is a remix of Zombie's 1998 
release Hellbilly Dtluxt, his sec-
ond solo album since departing 
from White Zombie. Htllbilly 
Deluxt was tolerable, but this 
album is ridiculous. 

Hardcore Zombie fans might 
enjoy this album, only due to the 
loyalty they feel they have to show 
him. All the old tunes sound hor-
ridlv unfamiliar in this new release. 

"Ora la," "Superbeast" and 
"Meet tre Creeper" are the more 
recognizable songs out of the pile, 
but even they have been trans-
formed into something nearly 
indistinguishable. 

What Zombie needs is a new 
album with new songs for once. 
This is the second remix album 
that Zombie has completed and 
"Superbeast" has been remixed 
twice on the same album. 

Zombie brought in other 
artists from the industry (Ramm-
stein, God Lives Underwater and 
a slew of other DJs) to remix the 
songs and cover up the fact that 
he has no talent left in his fingers 
or vocal chords. 

There are, hawever, two posi-
tive things to be said for the 
album. First, at least it is clear that 
Zombie can't get any worse. Sec-
ond, Zombie does have a Signa-
ture style of creating interesting 
album covers. Unfortunately, he 
can't seem to let go of his fetish 
with naked women and beasts 
sprawled across the entirety of 
the album sleeve. 

Zombie hasn't lost jUs creativi-
ty, however, and that may prove 
to be a plus for his upcoming 
albums. A new CD with a differ-
ent edge would go a long way to 
winning back many fans, but at 
this point, there's no light at the 
end of the tunnel.

TOY: 
Inside jokes and sly 
humor drive film 
ContI ....... from ..... 13 
to new characters such as the TOUT 
Guide Barbie Uodi Benson), and a 
veritable army of unwrapped 
Buzz Light year toys, who attempt 
to rewrap Andy's Buzz, whom 
they consider AWOL. 

Full of inside jokes and slyly 
placed adult humor, the movie 
appeals to both kids and adults. In 
one reference, Barbie explains to 
Andy's toys that there are plenty 
of Buzz toys available to buy now, 
unlike before, due to the short-
sightedness of toy manufacturers. 
This is an obvious reference to the 
shortage of Buzz Lightyear toys 
after the original "Toy Story" 
release, a sore spot for the out-
wardly bitter creators of the film: 

During the toy hunt, Woody IS 
taken by his captor, AI, to hiS 
apartment, where Woody reali~es 
he is part of a valuable collection 
of toys. Here, he meets other 
characters from the Woody series, 
such as Stinky Prospector Pete 
(Kelsey Grammar), jessie the 
Cowgirl Uoan Cusack), and his 
horse Bullseye (David Ogden 
Stiers). His new "family" explains 
that he is the final piece in the col-
lection and that he must accom-
pany them to japan to be on d.is-
play in a museum. Woody begms 
to feel compelled to stay and is 
tom between Andy and a new life 
as a valuable toy. 

Another hidden reference is in 
the character of the toy repair-
man, who repairs and cleans 
Woody before he is shipped off to 
japan. The old man was also f~a­
tured (in theaters at the begmnmg 
of the original "Toy Story") and 
"Geri's Game," the Pixar animat-
ed short that won an Academy 
Award in 1998. 

The themes in "Toy Story 2" 
are of similar flavor to its prede-
cessor, stressing the necessity for 
friendship and loyalty. This time, 
the value of friends and the small 
time we all have with each other 
is explained very delicately for a 
wider range of audiences. How-
ever Simplistic, this lesson is 
applicable to young kids and 
working adults. 

Everyone will appreciate the 
humor, references and lightheart-
ed adventure of "Toy Story 2," 
making it a good choice for the 
Thanksgiving holiday. 

TRADEMARK: 
Vinylphiles will host 
'Movement 2()()()' 
ContInued from ..... 17 
to 1 a.m. on the inside stage. 
Flown out specifically for this

Chicago house mixed into Euro-
pean trance. Nosmo is a returning 
performer to the UCSD ~ampus 
who first displayed his talents at 
the phenomenal "Movement '99" 
on jan. 10,'1999. 

"Trademark" was the DJs and 
Vinylphiles Club's 10th event on 
campus in the two short years 
since it became a campus orgam-
zation. 

The club is dedicated to the 
education and promotion of elec-
troniC music and the various 
methods of arranging, mixing 
and performing this music live. 
There are approximately 100 
members and 25 DJs in the club, 
making it one of the largest, while 
also one of the youngest, organi-
zations on the UCSD campus.

club is havmg a free daytime 
event, "Breaking Point," this Sat-
urday, Nov. 20 at the Hump from 
11 a.m. to 9 p.m. In addition,

LEGEND: 
Brosnan's Bond has 
pluses and minuses 
c ............ __ u 
tracking down his arch-nemesis 
Ernst Stavro Blofdd. The film, 
although fraught with poor editing 
and Lazenby's unpoliShed acting, 
shows us the human side of Bona. 
He is vulnerable and conflicted, as 
opposed to cocky and suave. In the 
end, instead of romancing the 
leading lady near a body of water 
(typical formulaic Bond), he is 
mourning over the loss of one. In 
the midst of poor reviews and box-
office returns, Lazenby was not 
recast and the 19'70s slapstick era 
of Bond commenced. 

Roger Moore added a humor-
ous touch to the role of the super 
agent. His witty persona and gen-
eral ease with himself, coupled 
with the escalation of action 
scenes, gave Bond a feeling that 
was larger than life. Moore prob-
ably delivered twice as many 
one-liners as Sean Connery 
throughout his tenure. 

Critics generally agree that 
half of Moore's films connected 
while the other half flopped. Part 
of Moore's success can be attrib-
uted to excellent supporting 
casts. In "The Spy Who Loved 
Me," Moore is flanked by Barbara 
Bach, who plays a beautiful Russ-
ian agent seeking revenge on 
Bond because he killed her lover. 
That · movie also features the 
intimidating "Jaws," who dis~ 
patches his victims with metal 
teeth. A young Jane Seymour 
made her stunning film debut in 
"Live and Let Die," and accom-
plished thespian Christopher 
Walken portrayed the Bond bad-
die in "A View to a Kill ." 

Among the lesser discussed 
Bond films of this era were 

UMoonraker," an Identical remake 
of "Spy," which substitutes outer 
space for deep sea aJ\d "The Man 
with the Golden Gun,'" featuring 
Herve Villichaize d a midget whc> 
exudes not one ounce of menace, 
though he is the henchman. 

Moore relinquished his license 
to kill well past his prime, paving 
the way for Shakespearean actor 
Tunothy Dalton. who delivered an 
underrated performance of Bond 
in "The Liv' Daylights" and 
"License to '::I H BOth films fea-
tured complex and intriguing plots 
that aimed to return James BOnd to 
the spirit of the early Connery 
movies and the ~ novels. 

In "The Living Daylights," 
Bond is involved in his most seri-
ous relationship since he got mar-
ried in "On Her Majesty's Secret 
Service." In "License to Kill," we 
see Bond driven not by the 
urgency of his government's 
orders, but by the whims of his 
anger and desire to avenge a dear 
friend's injuries. Dalton was per-
haps the best pure actor to take on 
the Bond role, but he lacked 
Moore's penchant for witticism 
and Connery's proficiency in the 
romance department. "Daylights" 
and "License" tanked at the 
domestic box office (the result of 
heated competition with . action 
blockbusters), prompting the pro-
ducers to recast 007 once again and 
prepare Bond for the 21st century. 

Enter Pierce Brosnan, the 
reigning James Bond. After 
" License to Kill," an unprecedent· 
ed six years elapsed before a new 
Bond film, prompting many to 
speculate that the series was 
dead. But "GoldenEye" erased 
those doubts with a strong box 
office showing and a decent per-
formance by Brosnan, who was 
offered the role before Dalton. 

Brosnan's Bond is the epitome 
of sophistication and invincibility. 
He makes everything look so easy, 

The UCSD Guardian 

whether it be a shooting spree 
through an enemy stron~old or a 
typical weapons briefing with 
"Q." The knock on Brosnan is that 
he fails to exhibit the human side 
of Bond, and that he's merely a 
killing machine. As evidenced by 
"The Thomas Crown Affair," Bros-
nan can act. The question is 
whether or not he can balance a 
more complex and character-rich 
Bond with the audience's insa-
tiable appetite for mind-blowing 
action sequences and stunts. "The 
World is Not Enough" should pro-
vide some answers. 

The legacy of James Bond will 
never be forgotten. The incredible 
influence of 007 extends to 
movies such as "Austin Powers" 
and "Mission Impossible," the 
cartoon Inspector Gadget, 
Spy tech (remember those toys?), 
vodka martinis - shaken, not 
stirred - and a popular Ninten-
do video game. 

Memorable James Bond charac-
ters include Oddjob, the Korean 
henchman who kills people with a 
steel-rimmed hat, Dr. No (who 
does the same with steel hands) 
and such gorgeous and creatively 
named Bond girls such as Honey 
Rider, Pussy Galore, HoUy Good; 
head and Octopussy. The James 
Bond theme is second to none next 
to "Star Wars" and each individual 
film features a knock-out score. 

But as a final note to the pro-
ducers, if you want to maintain 
this legacy so that generations and 
generations will know who 007 is, 
please remember that James Bond 
is not an action hero just as the 
movies are not action films. I'm 
not expecting a complete 
makeover or to tum the franchise 
into drama, but now and then, a 
little humanity doesn:t hurt. We 
would aU love to get inside the 
head of the greatest gentleman 
agent with a license to kill . James 
Bond. The name ~ys it all.

KeIIh Hamehent/CourIely at MIfIv GoIdIo)n IUyer 
..,..' All..: Q (Desmond Uewelyn, right) once again supplies 
Bond with an array of highly explosive gadgets and gizmos. 

BOND: 
Third time's the charm 
for each Bond actor 
Ca ..... ,... ... 11 
henchmen to "kill Bond now." He 
does his own dirty work and 
enjoys psychologically tOiling 
with the world's greatest agent. 

Man:eau also sparkles as Elek-
tea King. the wealthy and aggres-
sive heiress of an oil tycoon. She 
exudes a strong sensuality that 
draws Bond into a dangerous and 
emotionally unstable relation-
ship.1n the movie, 007 is assigned 
to protect her, but soon realizes 
that she has 'an agenda of her 
own. When the horrible and 
clever machination is finally 
revealed, Bond must deal not 
only with the physical difficulties 
of thwarting the villains' plans, 
but his own insecurities. It is this 
dramatic aspect of the movie that 
renders "World" superior to the 
action shoot-em ups of "Gold-
Eye" and "Tomorrow Never 
Di " es. 

When fans worldwide learned 
that Denise Richards ("Starship 
Troopers") was cast as the 
nuclear physicist Christmas 
Jones, they figured the director 
must know something they did-
n't. Apparently, it wasn't the fact 
ttiat Richards cannot act even 
when her life depends on it. 
Richards claims that her charac-
ter matches Bond in her ability to 
handle action situations. But this 

claim is absurd. Just because she 
doesn't stumble around and 
whine does not mean she can 
forge a personality of her own. 
Richards is one of the worst Bond 
girls in years ... and she doesn't 
even have a cool name. 

"World" features some of the 
best action sequences ever filmed 
for a Bond movie. In the pre-
credits scene, Bond escapes from 
a building. engages in a high-
speed boat chase and leaps onto a 
hot air balloon. Later in the 
movie, Bond and Elektra are 
drawn into an elaborate ski pur-
suit with a pair of parahawks 
(think fancy helicopters). The 
only weak point occurs at the end 
of the film when Bond's final 
confrontation with Renard 
appears a little lackluster and 
ends too quickly. 

The third film for each actor to 
play Bond has always been the 
most defining. Sean Connery set 
the standard in "Goldfinger," 
developing a formula to be emu-
lated in each subsequent film. 
Roger Moore's best film was 
"The Spy who Loved Me," a 
nuclear submarine thriller that 
reminded fans of the Bond of old. 
Likewise with "World," Brosnan 
has finally come into his own. He 
may never be as suave as Con-
nery or as funny as Moore, and 
the films will never be as gilt-
edged as the first three, but Bond 
is alive and kicking in the '90s. 
For James and fans across the 
globe, the century is not enough. 
The legacy marches on.

SWIM: 
Tritons successful in 
early meets 
c_ ........... 
(VCSC). 

The women were unstoppable, 
downing Bakersfield 138-105 and 
beating UCSC 166-67. 

Watanbe continued her stellar 
weekend when she took the 500 
freestyle in a 5:05.79. 

The Tritons swept the 200-
meter breast stroke 1-2 with 
Sandra Lopez and Lindsey 
Meeks swimming to times of 
2:28.63. 

The Tritons also took both 
relays, but with slower times than 
tho8e posted on Friday. 

"We're swimming really 
well," MeGihon said of the 
Triton women. "We're swim-
ming better than we were at this 
point last season. When the new 
national rankings come out, we 
should have some swimmers at 
the top." 

The guys fell to Bakersfield 
144-77 but rebounded to down 
UCSC 141-100. 

"We're Swimming really 
well. We're swimming 
better than we were at 
this point last season. 
When the new national 
rankings come out, we 
should have some 
swimmers at the top'-

. Mark Latronica set the lone B 
standard for the men, leading off 
the 400 medley relay with a split ' 
of :52.55. 

The men's team in the 400 
m~ and 400 free relays posted 
fast limes, going 3:32.84 and 
3:15.89, respectively. 

Dagart Allison also swam 
well, swimming the 1000 freestyle 
in a personal best of 10:16.34 . 

"Bakersfield is ranked number 
one in Division 11," MeGihon 
said. "They swim fast during the 
season. Last year they beat us 

The UCSD Guanlim 

pretty handily during the season, 
but we beat them in playoffs. I 
was happy with the end results of 
the team. We're two months 
ahead of where we were at this 
point last year." 

With his team already ahead of 
last year's skill level, MeGihon 
sees a good seaSon in the works 
this year. 

"We have a good infusion of 
freshman and some good upper-
c1assmen who want to do well in 
the last year of Division III," 
MeGihon said. "Our practice has 
been intense, and you see it when 
we compete." 

Not shying away from the big 
boys, the Triton swim team 
heads to Tucson this friday to 
face the University of Arizona 
and Northern Arizona 
University, while the diving 
squad travels to the USC Diving 
Invitational Thursday through 
Saturday. 

"The University of Arizona is 
ranked fourth in Division I and 
the men are ranked second," ( 
MeGihon said. "My philosophy is 
to swim against the best in the 
country and not beat up on the 
same teams all the time.

Track Runs to Success in Oregon 
SPRINT: The men come in second in the event, while the women win and begin preparing for nationals 
By BIU BURGER 
Staff Writer 

The cross country western 
regional was held last Saturday 
in Newburg, Ore. on the campus 
of Lewis and Clark College. 
Luckily for thl! UCSD team, 
alternative forms of travel were 
provided and the Tritons were 
not forced to run all the way to 
Oregon. Had they ran to there, 
they probably wouldn' t have 
had as successful a trip. 

The Triton women were a 
dominant force in Oregon last 
weekend. With a combined score 
of 57, the Tritons not only won the 
meet, but won in dominant fash-
ion by defeating their nearest 
rival by 17 total points. With their 
first-place finish, the UCSD 
women's team advances as a 
team to the NCAA Division-III 
Championship in Oshkosh, Wis. 
on Nov. 20. 

Freshman Carolyn Jones led 
the Tritons with a score of 18:02.7 
in the 5-kilometer race. This time 
was good enough for first place in 
the race as well as the western 
regional individual champi-
onship. 

MIUie Leur.tGu8fI1i8t) TIle,',. off: All the runners in Saturday's regional meet, including UCSO's James Nielsen (121), start the race in Oregon last Saturday. 
Nielsen eventually finished second and qualified for nationals. 

In her first year at UCSD, 
Jones has been the Triton's 
strongest runner ever since her 
first race. 

Amie Wu came in ninth over-
all and second among the Tritons 
with a time of 19:03.1. This time 
was less then 10 seconds off of the 
time to qualify for the national 
tournament as an individual. 
Only the top eight finishers in the 
race advance to nationals; so only 
Jones qualified as an individual 
for UCSD. 

Laura Cherdack and Sa rah 
Leonard finished within 1 sec-
ond of each other, the former 
coming in a time of 19:14.4 and 
the latter with a time of 19:15.4. 
Cherdack's time was good 
enough for 12th place while 
Leonard finished 13th overall. 

Karen Jordan rounded out the 
top five for the Tritons with a 
time of 19:33.2, taking 22nd 
place. 

"We came in fifth in the 
region last year," Van Arsdale 
said. "In the competitions early 
on we saw the potential to do 
much better than that this year. 
We knew we had something spe-
cial. " 

The men finished in a tie for 
second place in the region and 
the women, who finished fifth 
last year, won the western region 
by a large margin over second-
place Claremont-Mudd-Scripps. 

The Triton men had a multi-
tude of problems before the race 
even began. 

"David Dunbar ran with a 

bronchial infection and ran 
incredibly under the circum-
stances," Head Coach Ted Van 
Arsdale said. "Damian Garcia 
also had some problems before 
the race." 

Despite the pre-race drama, 
the men performed well enough 
to come up with a tie for second 
place at the meet. 

Puget Sound University led 
the way with a score of 75 points. 
The Tritons tied C1aremont-

Mudd-Scripps, each coming in 
witli a total of 83. Whittier 
College and Lewis and Clark 
College rounded out the top five. 

James Nielsen led the way for 
the Tritons with a time of 
25:44.8. His performance was 
good enough for second at the 
meet. With this performance, 
Neilsen has an excellent chance 
at finishing in the top 10 up next 
weekend's NCAA National 
Tournament. 

Nathan Garcia was UCSD's 
second finisher, coming in ninth 
overall with a time of 26:37.2. 

"Nathan ran an incredible 
race," Van Arsdale said. "He was 
12th with 400 meters to go an 
kept finding something more." 

Rory Clarke finished third for 

the Tritons, coming in with a time 
of 26:51.2, good enough for 14th 
overall. 

Nielsen will be the lone 
UCSD male competitor in 
Wisconsin next weekend, quali-
fying on the strength of his sec-
ond-place finish at regionals. All 
the UCSD women runners, who 
are ranked 11th in the nation, 
will be running and hope for a 
perforrnance that lives up to 
their ranking. 

Their coach has confidence in 
their capabilities. 

"The whole reason for region-
als is to prepare for nationals," 
Van Arsdale said. "I think we got 
some good preparation last week 
and look forward to next week-
end."

Coach Scott McGihon said. "It's 
a pretty significant win against a 
program that offars scholar-

last week. We don't swim 
against San Diego State for 
whatever reason, but that 
speaka a lot for our team as a
