Alvarez said. “My voice is not heard in there. There 
was never any explanation of how these errors hap-
pened. There was no evidence.”

Davies said that the university stands by the 
audit, which she called “very thorough and compre-
hensive.”

The audit report leveled several charges against 
Alvarez, including that she ordered open access to 
grade recording software and encouraged teachers to 
provide students with “extraordinary accommoda-
tions” to improve their grades. Eleven of 21 current 
and former teachers interviewed by the auditors said

After a recent university audit uncovered mul-
tiple instances of improper grade reporting and 
administrative mismanagement at UCSD’s nationally 
recognized Preuss charter school, campus officials 
are preparing to select an external consulting firm 
to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the 
school’s operations.

UCSD’s Audit and Management Advisory 
Services released results of the six-month-long audit 
in December, which stated that 144 of 190 student 
transcripts reviewed by auditors contained one or 
more inaccurate grades. Approximately 72 percent of 
the 427 altered grades were found to have improved 
the affected student’s academic standing. Investigators 
also concluded that ex-Principal Doris Alvarez and a 
former counselor “likely had knowledge of and/or 
directed inappropriate grade changes.”

In consultation with Preuss Board of Directors 
Chair Cecil Lytle and other university personnel, 
Interim Vice Chancellor of Resource Management 
and Planning Gary C. Matthews will soon begin 
interviewing various advisory organizations with 
experience in charter school management. Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox assigned administrative oversight of 
all Preuss activities to Matthews in the report, which 
recommended an independent analysis of the school’s 
administrative practices. The upcoming review will 
mark the first external programmatic investigation 
into school policies since its founding in 1999 as an 
educational gateway for underprivileged students. 
Preuss has since been heralded as a model for charter 
schools, and was ranked the 10th best high school in 
the nation by U.S. News & World Report in 2007.

Representatives from the San Diego Unified 
School District, which co-charters the Preuss School 
with UCSD, will also be involved in the selec-
tion process, said Executive Director of University 
Communications Dolores Davies.

Alvarez, who was placed on paid leave last 
September while the audit was being conducted, con-

ment by Ellen Browning Scripps, the 
original conditions of which stated 
that the Children’s Pool must remain 
a bathing pool for children and a 
public park.

However, more than a decade ago, 
seals began occupying the beach and 
eventually overtook it.

Pate’s ruling required the city to 
return the beach to its “pre-seal” con-
dition within six months, barred the 
city from protecting the seals and 
ordered the dredging of 3,000 cubic 

appeal.

PASS WARREN 
FEE HIKE IN 
LANDSLIDE

Following more than two months 
of campaigning, Dec. 7 marked clo-
sure for proponents of the Warren 
College Activity Fee Referendum, 
which met the required participa-
tion threshold and was approved by  
74.2 percent of voters.

Approximately 21.2 percent of 
Warren students voted during the 
weeklong special election, 656 of 
whom voted to increase the fee 
by $3 a quarter. The referendum 
will allocate $26,199 to Warren 
College Student Council program-
ming and student groups, includ-
ing the Warren Live! concert and 
the Warren Transfer Commuter 
Commission.

“I had no doubt that it was going 
to get more yeses than noes,” said 
WCSC Parliamentarian Dan Palay, 
who initially proposed the fee ref-
erendum. “It was always the 20-per-
cent mark that was hard to gauge. It 
was just one of those things that you 
have to push until the end.”

Palay said that although the 21-
percent turnout may appear disap-

The decade-long feud over the 
presence of a harbor seal colony at the 
La Jolla Children’s Pool became more 
complex last month after the federal 
government stepped in to defend the 
rookery, which was immediately fol-
lowed by a major setback for advo-
cates concerned with the safety and 
protection of the seals.  

Last month, the National Marine 
and Fisheries Service requested that 
San Diego city officials set up a rope 
barrier to protect the seals during 
their calving season, which began last 
week and continues through May. 

A branch of the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration, the 
NMFS has received five to 10 seal-
related phone calls per week in the 
past six months, according to officials. 
Callers to the organization’s marine-
mammal hotline have reported occur-
rences in which the seals had alleg-
edly been harassed or scared off by 
humans. 

“The rope barrier has been a 
needed step in the right direction, 
but closing the beach would make 
a safer environment for the nursing 

seals,” said Donald Masters, a special 
agent at the Long Beach headquarters, 
in a letter to City Attorney Michael 
Aguirre.

However, Superior Court Judge 
Yuri Hofmann ruled on Jan. 4 that 
a rope barrier separating the seals 
and the public could not be installed, 
because it conflicted with a previ-
ous ruling by Superior Court Judge 
William C. Pate.

City officials were divided over 
the NMFS request, because a 2005 
ruling by Pate that stated the city was 
in violation of a 1931 trust agree-

tinues to deny any involvement in changing grades or 
pressuring teachers to evaluate students unfairly. She 
submitted her resignation as principal on Dec. 18.

“I am not going to apologize for anything I did,” 
she said. “I did nothing wrong.”

Senior counselor Phil Ensberg, Alvarez’s son-in-
law, was also placed on paid leave when the audit was 
initiated. He returned to work on Dec. 17.

A 30-year veteran educator, Alvarez said that 
AMAS auditors lacked sufficient credentials to prop-
erly analyze the school’s operations, alleging that they 
sensationalized the number of altered grades to make 
the situation seem worse than it really was.

“I believe the audit was biased and one-sided,”

pointing, in actuality it is a strong 
showing for UCSD students.

“It’s always disheartening to see 
how low the voter turnout is, but 
that’s only in the grand scheme of 
things,” he said. “At the same time, 
21 percent is a relatively high turn-
out of voters considering only 17 
percent voted in the past council 
election. It’s a double-edged sword.”

WCSC Elections Manager Aaron 
Horning said he was not particular-
ly worried about surpassing the 20-
percent participa-
tion barrier.

“I was pretty 
confident that we 
would be able to 
meet it,” he said.

The most dif-
ficult part of run-
ning the election 
was ensuring that 
the council fol-
lowed all of the 
college’s rules and 
bylaws, accord-
ing to WCSC 
President Jessica 
Fernandez.

“I was relieved overall that the 
week was over, because we had to 
make sure we were doing every-
thing just right according to the 
rules,” Fernandez said. “I’m just 
really happy about the way it was 
run.”

Horning said he modified the 
pro and con statements before plac-
ing them on the ballot in order to 
make them more sensible. Initially, 
the drafted “con” statement was 
only eight words long.

Chancellor, UC President 
Must Approve Fee Increase
▶ REFERENDUM, from page 1 “It wasn’t to make them equal, 

it was to convey the truth of both 
sides,” Horning said.

The ballots were offered at voting 
polls run by volunteers, who kept 
the polls open until the final ballot 
was cast on Dec. 7 despite cold and 
rainy weather. Horning counted the 
votes and then collaborated with 
Fernandez to send certified election 
results to the Warren dean.

 “We’re kind of in a holding pat-
tern now, since it has to go through 
the university,” Palay said.

Now that 
Warren students 
have green-
lighted the ref-
erendum, it will 
pass through the 
Student Affairs 
d e p a r t m e n t , 
which includes 
Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue and 
C h a n c e l l o r 
Marye Anne Fox, 
before ending up 
on the desk of 

UC President Robert C. Dynes. If 
approved, the fee hike will take effect 
in Spring Quarter.

With the promise of more funds, 
WCSC officials are planning a 
revamp of the college’s student life.

“I think it will certainly give 
programming boards more freedom 
to put on bigger and better events, 
which will affect Warren in a posi-
tive way,” Fernandez said.

yards of sand accumulation at the 
Children’s Pool. 

The ruling was later upheld by 
a 3-0 appellate court decision last 
September. The state Supreme Court 
declined to hear the case two months 
later.

The seals’ continuous presence on 
the beach poses a health threat to 
swimmers because their feces con-
taminate the water, prompting the city 
to limit beach access to swimmers, 
divers and tourists. The San Diego 
City Council previously acted on a 
compromise, erecting the rope bar-
rier for several birthing and pupping 
seasons.

Members of the UCSD commu-
nity have participated in guarding the 
seals’ designated area, educating visi-
tors and conducting research, while 
others have written letters and spoken 
at city council meetings.

Bryan Pease, an attorney for 
the Animal Protection and Rescue 
League, filed suit in federal court  
early last month, arguing that Pate’s 
interpretation violates the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act.

The MMPA prohibits the harass-
ment, hunting, capture, killing or col-
lecting of marine mammals in U.S. 
waters and by U.S. citizens.

At the Jan. 4 hearing, Hofmann 
gave the city two weeks to provide an 
update on its efforts to improve the 
water quality at the Children’s Pool.

In an APRL-sponsored opinion 
poll by Zogby International, 81 per-
cent of San Diegans and 91 percent 
of La Jollans said they want increased 
protection for the seals.

MONDAY, JANUARY 7, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS  7

that Alvarez and the former counselor 
pressured them to modify their grad-
ing options in a manner they would 
not have otherwise done.

Alvarez vehemently denied both 
allegations, saying that auditors ignored 
her efforts to solve the grading prob-
lem immediately after it was reported 
to her. She said the only person with 
authorization to change grades was an 
unidentified former registrar, whom 
Alvarez terminated last April for alter-
ing her son’s transcript while he was a 
Preuss student.

Most of the grade changes were 
probably due to incompatible grade 
recording systems at Preuss and 
SDUSD, Alvarez said.

Auditors noted that they could not 
find any signed forms reporting initial 
grade entries, signed grade authori-
zation forms or signed grade sheet 
printouts for most of the records they 
examined. However, they were unable 
to determine whether the documents 
were misplaced, intentionally removed 
or destroyed.

The records were kept in a locked 
storage room to which only one per-
son had access, Alvarez said, but she 
declined to identify the individual.

“There were errors in maintaining 
those records, and I take responsibility 
for those,” she said. “I’ll take responsi-
bility, but I won’t take the responsibility 
of being called dishonest.”

Additionally, Alvarez said the 
notion that she pressured teachers into 
giving high grades is ridiculous.

“Nobody came to me and said they 
felt pressured,” she said. “Good teach-
ers don’t feel that kind of pressure.”

She argued that inflating students’ 
grades would violate Preuss’ core edu-
cational mission.

“The goal is preparation, not infla-
tion,” she said. “Why would we want 
grades to be inflated and have students 
go to college and fail?”

However, former Preuss govern-
ment teacher Greg Campbell sided 

Ex-Principal: Grade Inflation Contrary to School’s Goals
▶ AUDIT, from page 1

made use of surveys, focus groups and 
usability exercises to gather input from 
prospective and current students, their 
families, faculty, staff and alumni.

CWEC Chair and Audrey 
Geisel University Librarian Brian 
Schottlaender said that while there 
were differences between the directions 
in which the various groups wanted to 
see the Web site evolve, most of those 
involved in the process expressed the 
desire for a Web site that even those 
unfamiliar with UCSD could easily use 
and enjoy. 

“The biggest difference between 
the new Web site and the previous 
version is the philosophy behind it,” 
Schottlaender said in an e-mail. “The 
previous Web site was very organiza-
tion-centric, which is to say it was built 
‘by us, for us.’ The organization and 
structure of the site made sense only to 
people already heavily immersed in the 
UC San Diego culture. The design of 
the new Web site, on the other hand, is 
user-centered.”

Central to this user-friendly notion 
are new features such as information 
about the six-college system, direct 
links to each college’s Web site, a 
Google search box and a consistent 
visual presentation that will eventually 
be expanded to the individual UCSD 
department Web sites as well. 

CWEC members have access to 
consultants to develop and maintain 
the site’s features, as well as a full-time 
usability expert hired to preserve an 
attractive and technologically forward 
site.

The impetus for the Web site’s 
redesign lies in the rapid evolution 
of Internet technology. Many of the 
processes and theories behind the site’s 

with the auditors’ assessment of 
Alvarez’s management, saying that she 
frequently used weekly staff meetings 
to remind teachers that it was essential 
for students to earn high grades.

“It was expected that [students] 
would all earn C’s or better,” said 
Campbell, whose Preuss contract was 
not renewed following the 2003-04 
school year. “If we weren’t up to the 
challenge, we should leave.”

Campbell said that Alvarez’s 
authority to renew teacher contracts, 
which are evaluated on a year-to-year 
basis, contributed to an intimidating 
environment in which staff members 
were afraid to approach her with con-
cerns.

“[Alvarez] had tremendous control 
over hiring and firing,” he said. “We 
were at-will employees. If we chal-
lenged certain concepts, we were risk-
ing losing our jobs.”

The auditors recommended that a 
better-defined evaluation process for 
teachers should be considered, along 
with a possible lengthening of teacher 
contract periods.

In October, former history teacher 
Jennifer Howard filed a legal claim 
against the school alleging that Alvarez 
terminated her for complying with the 
auditors. In a formal complaint writ-
ten to Lytle on July 7, Howard said 
Alvarez rescinded her offer of employ-
ment after she approached her about 
grade changes and inaccurate atten-
dance figures.

In a July 23 e-mail obtained by the 

Guardian, Lytle told Howard that her 
dismissal was not based on her involve-
ment with the audit, but “information 
that came to [Alvarez] while holding 
[Howard’s] contract for her signature.” 
The response did not specify the nature 
or source of the information, and Lytle 
did not respond to repeated requests 
for comment.

Howard declined an interview at 
her attorney’s request, and Alvarez said 
she could not speak about university-
related personnel matters.

Alvarez said she suspects the audit’s 
timing — which she claimed surfaced 
during a year where the university has 
been a frequent target of media criti-
cism — contributed to the severity of 
its response.

“It’s a sham that the university had 
to make a statement about how strong 
and decisive they were,” she said. “At 
another time, this probably wouldn’t 
have happened.”

Further disciplinary action against 
Preuss employees may be taken as 
deemed appropriate, Davies said.

Acting Principal Scott Barton 
will continue his duties throughout 
the remainder of the academic year. 
Alvarez will serve as an adviser to 
Senior Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Paul Drake until she retires 
from UCSD in June. Alvarez’s experi-
ence and leadership will benefit Drake 
in handling Preuss-related matters, 
Davies said.

One of Alvarez’s primary respon-
sibilities is working on the continu-

ation of the school’s charter, which 
will be up for renewal later this year. 
Representatives from SDUSD’s Office 
of School Choice, which oversees char-
ter schools, could not be reached for 
comment.

It is too soon to tell whether the 
school’s recent accolades are due in part 
to inflated grades, said Don Sorensen, 
Vice President of Marketing at Caveon 
LLC, a security firm that has investi-
gated school cheating nationwide.

Sorensen said that in his experi-
ence, schools whose performance was 
influenced by administrative tamper-
ing typically saw marks fall when they 
were observed by an outside source.

“Scores generally went way up, the 
next year they were monitored, and 
the score gain dramatically dropped 
because someone was watching,” he 
said.

A.S. Council President Marco 
Murillo, a 2004 Preuss graduate, said 
the controversy has not shaken his 
faith in the charter school’s student 
body or its ability to perform academi-
cally.

OPINION

I’m just going to throw this out there: VH1 was dead wrong in its assessment of who had the 
best year ever.

For some reason, the television 
channel that introduced us to New 
York’s peculiar beach-ball-sized 
breasts dubbed “rehab” the winner 
of the 2007 title, from a field of com-
petitors that also included Daniel 

Radcliffe (confession: I still have 
yet to read or see any Harry Potter 
books or movies), Sanjaya Malakar 
(the ponyhawk-sporting, not-gay 
loser of “American Idol”) and the 
ambiguous category of “Internet 
sensations” (think “Leave Britney 
alone!”).

Though I don’t watch television 
very often, I can recognize that VH1 
wasted its pop-culture crown. For 
one, the nominees were flawed. I 
mean, the producers of “Best Year 
Ever” didn’t even include some of 
2007’s biggest headline makers, and 
I’m not talking about Paris, Britney 
or Lindsay.

I’m talking about me. That’s right, 
sorry to break it to you all, but I had 
the best year ever. I may not have 
assaulted a car with an umbrella, 
cried about being hauled back to 
jail, had my child visitation rights 
stripped, publicly uttered racial 
slurs, gotten pregnant or adopted 
a malnourished foreign baby, but I 
did get an A-plus in VIS 21 (suck on 
that, haters).

Really though, 2007 was a great 
year for me, and here’s a recap of 
why:

A.S. COUNCIL — It’s no secret that the 
La Jolla community can be unwelcom-
ing to UCSD students, often isolating 
the noisy hooligans who monopolize 
affordable housing and drag down 
local property values. Trying to inte-
grate students into a neighborhood 
that shuts down at 10 p.m. is a histori-
cally difficult task, but A.S. Associate 
Vice President of Local Affairs Aida 
Kuzucan is making significant strides 
toward bridging that gap. Or, she would 
be — if anyone were helping her.

To onlookers at the Dec. 2 La 
Jolla Christmas Parade, in which A.S. 

Council representatives were sched-
uled to appear, it must have seemed 
like Kuzucan was the victim of one of 
the oldest practical jokes on record. 
After waiting a fruitless hour in full elf 
garb for someone to help her spread 
the campus’ holiday cheer, she was 
forced to inform parade officials that 
UCSD would not be participating.

When examined in a greater con-
text, the situation represents a prob-
lem more serious than mere embar-
rassment: the noticeable and perva-
sive lack of zeal among many of this 
year’s councilmembers. In contrast to 
its perpetually active predecessor, this 
group’s inconsistent attendance at its 
other events last quarter has left more 
than just Kuzucan wondering where 
the council has been hiding. 

For the parade, the problem appears 
to be one of follow-through.

Things looked promising when 
Kuzucan initially proposed that UCSD 
enter a float into the local holiday cel-
ebration, and 25 of her peers promised 
to help her build it. When no one 

showed up at designated construction 
time, however, she abandoned the float 
idea in favor of a simpler request: 
that councilmembers simply attend the 
parade. Twelve agreed to do so, but 

the number dwindled to five the day 
before the event.

“I thought, ‘At least La Jolla’s going 
to say that UCSD will be represented in 
the community,’” Kuzucan said.

Ultimately, though, she was wrong 

— not a single councilmember joined 
San Diego’s saddest elf that day, effec-
tively flipping La Jolla a very jolly mid-
dle finger. While some of the no-shows 
offered up excuses of varying legitima-
cy, Kuzucan claimed that a number of 
them never even mentioned it again.

Whatever reasons they may offer, 
UCSD’s already strained community 
relations took another hard hit — one 
that our student leaders could have 
easily prevented.

Prior to the council’s constitution 
revamp last year, local affairs were left 
up to the habitually swamped external 
relations liaison, making their imple-
mentation even more difficult. The 
creation of Kuzucan’s position was 
designed to promote the development 
of community ties, which, if anything, 
should have increased the number of 
new projects in which the council could 
participate. What it was not designed 
to do, however, is facilitate the shirking 
of councilmembers’ responsibility to 
act as the representatives of the student 
body. Maintaining local relationships, 

like any council duty, is not a simple 
one-person job.

Whether the aborted parade was a 
result of apathy or just bad timing, it 
should serve as a reminder that each 
councilmember represents more than 
just him- or herself as an individual. If 
a certain college’s two senators skip out 
on an event, for example, the college is 
not represented. In a case as extreme as 
this one, if every single councilmember 
bails on a commitment, the campus as 
a whole is not represented. 

If issues with participation were 
parade-specific, it would be easy to 
write the situation off as an isolated 
instance and chalk it up to circum-
stance. However, Vice President of 
Student Life Donna Bean has publicly 
reprimanded the council for its lack-
luster participation on more than one 
occasion, after its members skipped 
out on a food giveaway designed to 
promote the council’s on-campus pres-
ence, along with two other activities

Authorities Overreact to Student Socializing, 
Exploit the New Visibility of Facebook

By Jake Blanc
Senior Staff Writer

STUDENT LIFE — In a society where 
political correctness and an over-obses-
sion with caution and safety prevail, 
there is very little wiggle room for 
anything illicit. When such a guarded 
mantra is combined with technolo-
gy that allows anyone with an e-mail 
address to access unlimited photos, 
blogs and social networks, the margin 
for those wishing to get away with 
prohibited activities shrinks yet again. 
The question at hand is the severity and 
implications of these prohibited actions 
that are now being unearthed by social 
networking Web sites like Facebook 
and MySpace. Events that decades ago 
would have, for the most part, gone 
unnoticed are now being harshly pun-
ished, leaving this guinea pig genera-
tion of Internet users to struggle with 
what technology offers and the need to 
adapt to and alter patterns of socializa-
tion.

The recent allegation brought 
against Sigma Nu sheds light on an 
issue that has always existed but has 
only recently, due to new technology, 
become more dynamic and conten-
tious: hazing. 

Hazing is wrong, and no one 
should ever be made to do anything 
against his or her will that causes 
any sort of physical or mental harm. 
According to the Web site of Sigma 
Nu’s national headquarters, hazing is 
defined as “any action taken or situa-
tion created, intentionally, whether on 
or off fraternity premises, to produce 
mental or physical discomfort, embar-
rassment, harassment or ridicule.” 
These are appropriate parameters that 
ensure the safety and well-being of 
students, but when this definition of 

hazing is subjectively inter-
preted and expanded, too 

many innocuous activi-
ties get chastised along 

the way.
The frater-

nity has found 
itself in hot 
water because 
an anony-
mous source 
informed the 

national head-
quarters of pos-

sible hazing occuring within the 
UCSD chapter. The smoking gun used 
to build a case against Sigma Nu: pho-
tos obtained from the Facebook profile 
of a few fraternity brothers. This brings 
up a glaring example of how anybody 
can abuse such social networking sites 
in order to strike 
a serious blow to 
both individuals 
and whole orga-
nizations.

Neither local 
chapter President 
Robbie Holmes 
nor the national 
Sigma Nu orga-
nization have 
yet to reveal the 
photos’ exact 
contents, leav-
ing the specific 
hazing incidents 
in question up for debate. Although 
purely speculation, it is fair to assume 
that the pictures contain at least some 
instances of underage drinking, which 
could fall under the category of hazing, 
as it entails that the pledges were forced 
to drink in order to be allowed into the 
fraternity.

It is one thing if the alleged Sigma 
Nu hazing pictures showed senior 
members pinning a freshman pledge 
to the ground while forcing a beer 
bong down his throat, but if the pic-
tures turn out to show nothing more 
than different varieties of underage 
drinking, then no serious punishment 
should be dealt. Students join fraterni-
ties and sororities knowing very well 
that it means partying and drinking, 
and in many cases, they pledge for 
those exact reasons. The willingness of 
students to join these Greek organiza-
tions under their own free will should 
be respected, and as long as there is no 
threat of any real harm befalling them, 
then the students should be allowed to 
discover for themselves what they have 

chosen to participate in. 
There are, of course, examples of 

blatant hazing, and these should be 
used as a platform to eliminate events 
that take initiation way too far. In 
2005, a Chico State fraternity pledge, 
Matthew William Carrington, died 
after he was forced to drink excessive 
amounts of water, literally drowning to 
death. Rumors and tales of hazing that 
would sicken the average UCSD stu-
dent — from naked “elephant walks” 
through the student center to defile-
ment of private property to forced 
public defecation — abound from 
other college campuses. These inci-
dents are glaring and disturbing, and 
should be avoided to maintain civility 
and an overall sense of morality on 
college campuses. 

Recently, these horrific examples 
have been clumped 
together with com-
parably minor 
offenses under haz-
ing’s wide umbrel-
la, largely thanks 
to the role played 
by social network-
ing Web sites. It 
would be stupid 
for any student to 
post pictures of a 
hazing event that 
obviously caused 
immense damage, 
but there appear to 

be no such hesitations when it comes 
to posting pictures of drinking at par-
ties, as evidenced in the ubiquitous 
pictures of students drinking that can 
be found on Facebook profiles. 
Without the availability of hard 
evidence, the pictures show-
ing less serious activities are 
all that the authorities have 
in order to stop any haz-
ing that may occur.

Underage drinking 
is illegal, and if students 
are caught in person 
under the influence of 
alcohol, they’re in a situa-
tion to be justly punished. 
If underclassmen are found 
drinking in a campus dorm, 
they are merely written up and 
required to complete some com-
munity service. If a minor is 
caught drinking at an off-campus 
party, more often than not the 
police simply ask them to empty 
their drinks and leave the party. So 
why do pictures of underage drink-

ing found on Facebook merit more 
serious punishments? 

With no frat row, Sigma Nu parties 
are thrown in houses scattered around 
the greater San Diego area, and when 
these parties get busted by the cops, 
most of the time the multitude of 
students that had just been partaking 
in illegal activities are allowed off scot-
free. Yet it is only now that the red flag 
of “hazing” has been thrown up due to 
Facebook pictures that the fraternity 
finds itself facing serious retribution. 

It is absolutely ridiculous to use any 
content found on these social network-
ing sites as the sole evidence in a case. 
People can straight-up lie in blogs to try 
and impress friends and rambunctious 
students tend to exaggerate in front of 
a camera, adding embellished elements 
to the photos found on their Facebook 
profiles. While there is a slight chance 
that some information and pictures 
have been fabricated, the reality is that 
these pictures are most likely indicative 
of students’ illegal actions. Although 
these pictures may show a kid drink-
ing alcohol, they do not prove that he 
did, and that is the most important 
distinction that can be made. It is 
understandable that authorities would 
see these pictures and use them as a 
starting point to then gather more sub-
stantiated evidence, but on their own, 
the images are only hearsay. Unless 
administrators can research and find 
out if the contents of an incriminating 

“ It is absolutely ridiculous to use any content found on these social networking 
sites as the sole 

evidence in a case.”

MONDAY, JANUARY 7, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

Loft-Bashing Article Is a 
Premature Downer 

Dear Editor,
Price Center opens its new expan-

sion later this year to much fanfare 
from students, faculty and staff. 
While there are points of contention 
that are worthy of coverage (cost, 
design, potential vendors), the opin-
ion article on Dec. 6 titled, “Despite 
Lofty Ambitions, Upcoming Campus 
Nightclub Misses Mark” did not add 
much value to the discussion. The 
writer details several negative points 
including size of venue and style 
choice without providing any alter-
natives. 

How can one create an intimate 
venue and accommodate a univer-
sity with over 25,000 students, staff 
and faculty? Existing venues such as 
RIMAC Arena handle large events 
and its size does not automatically 
suggest that community building is 
taking place. Students could experi-
ence more social bonding watch-
ing soccer games on TV in their 
International House apartments 
than attending a sporting event at 
RIMAC. Therefore, planning events 
that attract students, faculty and 
staff to the Loft is of much more 
importance than room size.

The writer also talks about how 
the Loft will be a chic place that will 
be overly artistic and mature for the 
UCSD audience. Not having seen 
the final product, I cannot comment 
on the planner’s choices. However, 
trying to find a style to appease the 
masses is easier said than done. 

The author mentions doing a 
comprehensive survey to measure 
students’ tastes. Unfortunately, tastes 
and likes are fickle, but in having 
a venue in place, you can make 
changes as time goes by. In regards 
to maturity, this venue will be serv-
ing alcohol so a substantial portion 

of the clientele will be adults. Lastly, 
what is so bad about a more sophis-
ticated environment? It does not 
seem to be hurting local downtown 
businesses such as Stingaree, Side 
Bar and Altitude.

Finally, the article does not 
mention any alternatives to what is 
being built. He talks about model-
ing the Loft after other popular 
venues. Which ones? PB Bar and 
Grill? Canes? On Broadway? The 
suggestions above? All of these are 
fine places, but would they appeal to 
a more diverse student population 
than what is currently being built? 
Hard to say.

I did not write this letter to slam 
the author. After all, it is an opinion 
piece. Nevertheless, it is important 
to give the Loft a chance. Some of its 
ideas will succeed and some will fail. 
In the end, the UCSD community 
should take advantage of all the new 
amenities at the new and improved 
Price Center.

lous crowd you could ever imag-
ine (picture cheetah-print tights 
and more ’do-rags than a bad rap 
video). During the longest, most 
drunken and most awkward eleva-
tor ride I’ve ever had in my life, a 
group of gangsta guys told me and 
my friends, “It’s all right. Y’all can 
laugh.” We then proceeded to cut 
in front of about 100 people wait-
ing for a taxi outside our hotel by 
just walking to the front and act-
ing important. On the way home, 
a crazy old homeless guy lifted up 
his shirt and shouted, “Have you 
ever seen anyone as sexy as this?” 
Naturally, I was flattered.

April: Found a $20 bill on the 
ground. Bomb.

May: Chugged nearly half a bottle 

of a disgusting, warm random brand 
of mango-flavored rum on Sun God 
and didn’t throw up. Baller.

June: Threw a full Rubio’s cup 
at some BMW-driving, cell-phone-
blabbing blonde La Jolla bitch who 
repeatedly honked at me in the 
Ralphs parking lot for no reason.

September: Managed to sup-
press my anger when my room-
mate’s friend thought it would be 
funny to throw a shot of whiskey 
in my eyes. (It was actually kind of 
funny though.)

October: Didn’t have a Halloween 
costume, so I improvised by grab-
bing the first things I could find in 
my room, which happened to be 
a toy gun and an American flag. 
I ended up going as the “mother-
fuckin’ United States.”

photo are, in fact, valid, they should 
not be able to use these pictures as the 
basis of prosecution. 

The availability of pictures and 
blogs online has added a new dimen-
sion of paranoia a la Big Brother. 
Students at parties must now make 
sure not to be photographed with any 
incriminating substances, hiding their 
beverages before pictures are snapped, 
or simply refusing to be in the pic-
ture at all. Athletes in particular must 
make a concerted effort to portray 
images of virtue, and considering it is a 
well-known fact that the UCSD sports 
teams throw the best parties, this is 
often a very difficult task. 

The recent suspension of the UCSD 
women’s ultimate Frisbee team is a per-
fect example of what can now happen 
when a member of a sports team care-
lessly posts pictures of generation-long 
customs. The yearly ultimate Frisbee 
initiation party is not a site of ritualistic 
hazing, but a celebration of the season 

Administrators Should Protect UCSD’s Social Side 
▶ HAZING, from page 4 to come and a warm welcome to a new 

batch of freshman players. But when 
pictures were found on Facebook 
showing supposed underage drinking, 
the team was suspended for the entire 
2007-08 season. 

The social outlets available to 
UCSD students are thin enough as it 
is, so seeing Greek organizations and 
sports teams robbed of their social 
components is a great travesty for stu-
dent life. The national headquarters of 
Sigma Nu is leading the hazing inves-
tigation of UCSD’s chapter, leaving 
campus administrators with very little 
say in the subsequent punishment. 
Considering administrators want to 
improve the university’s social life with 
their creation of the Loft, a new cam-
pus nightclub, imagine the statement 
that they would be sending students 
if they made a stand of solidarity with 
Sigma Nu and campaigned for them 
to receive as little punishment as pos-
sible from the national headquarters. 
Creating new areas for socializing is 

easy enough for the school because it 
can claim all credit for the innovation, 
but strengthening the already existent 
social groups would be a much greater 
show of support for their supposed 
desire to eliminate UCSD’s stereotype 
as UC Socially Dead.

The difference between malicious 
hazing and good-natured socializing 
must be distinguished   — if not, stu-
dents will become frustrated and huge 
levels of animosity will be created. Until 
administrators realize that pictures 
found online are nowhere near enough 
evidence to unleash their bureaucratic 
wrath, students must refrain from post-
ing any complicit information. Sigma 
Nu should not be made the scapegoat 
for all hazing, and every effort should 
be made to keep administrators from 
exploiting the social networking in 
which this generation of students has 
become so ingrained.

she organized.
“For the most part, the council just 

doesn’t show up to things,” Bean said.
Looking at the council as a whole, 

there could be any number of possible 
reasons as to why the group has got-
ten off to a slower start than in prior 
years. In the former constitution, each 
college had four senators as opposed 
to the current two, which promoted 
the instant formation of groups ready 
to tackle more ambitious projects. 
Weekly council meetings offer their 
own clues, as heated back-and-forths 
between councilmembers over even 
inconsequential matters paint a clear 
picture of polarized and divided gov-
ernance.

The old council also had the leader-

ship of charismatic ex-President Harry 
Khanna, who undertook several mas-
sive projects — including the turf war 
over Student-Run Television and the 
aforementioned constitutional over-
haul — that required and engaged the 
attention of the full council. This year 
has lacked any such large-scale efforts, 
which could explain the absence of 
enthusiasm with which senators have 
treated the smaller issues. In any case, 
the reasons are immaterial: The coun-
cil needs to unify quickly, or it’s the 
students they represent who will be 
losing out.

In an attempt to remedy this prob-
lem, Bean and A.S. President Marco 
Murillo are planning major events 
in the coming weeks to increase the 
council’s visibility, while Kuzucan is

currently assembling a newsletter of 
councilmembers’ upcoming proj-
ects. As of two days before Kuzucan’s 
deadline, only half of the council had 
responded to her. Clearly, these are 
steps in the right direction, but they 
will only be effective if participation 
sees a sharp increase.

It would certainly behoove the MIA 
councilmembers to unbury their heads 
from the sand and get themselves 
into the game as quickly as possible. 
Otherwise, if they continue to act as 
individuals and not a unified group, 
they could easily find themselves the 
next melancholy elves warding off the 
stares of judgmental soccer moms.

First in a two-part series exploring the history of the uni-
versity’s affiliation with nuclear technology laboratories.

N
uclear weapons have been the subject of con-
troversy for over 60 years since their inven-
tion in 1945 and subsequent role in World 
War II, and the UC system has played a large 
role in that controversy. The first U.S. war-

heads were developed in UC-managed labs at Berkeley, 
Los Alamos and Livermore, and every nuclear weapon 
in the current stockpile was developed in said labs with 
extensive research by UC-affiliated scientists. The labs 
continue nuclear-weapon research to this day.

The UC system managed Department of Energy 
weapons labs in Berkeley, Livermore and Los Alamos 
since their inception until a series of administrative 
mishaps in 2003 prompted Congress to require the lab 
contracts for Livermore and Los Alamos be put up for 
bid. The university then formed Los Alamos National 
Security, Limited Liability Corporation, with private 
industrial partners Bechtel, BWX Technologies, and 
Washington Group International. The university also 
formed Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC 
with the same three companies, adding Battelle as a 
partner and Texas A&M University as an academic alli-
ance. The Department of Energy selected both compa-
nies, with LANS taking over in June 2006 and LLNS tak-
ing over in October 2007. The UC system still directly 
manages the Berkeley lab.

Politics of a Nuclear Age
Congressmembers have become increasingly famil-

iar with the longstanding nuclear debate since the 
introduction of the Reliable Replacement Warhead and 
its predecessor, the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, 
or “bunker buster” warhead. Congress cut all funding 
for the latter project, essentially canceling it in October 
2005. The RRW faces a similar situation after Congress 
confirmed a $73.8-million funding cut in December 
2007, leaving $15 million in Navy funding and zero 
in National Nuclear Security Administration funding 
for the project. The project may receive more funding 
depending on Congress’ reaction to a pending nuclear 
programs review by the NNSA, but the question is, 
should it?

The RRW has currently entered the design defini-
tion and cost analysis phase at Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory, after the lab won the contract in 
a Department of Defense-hosted competition with Los 
Alamos National Laboratory in March 2007.

The NNSA, a semi-autonomous agency established 
within the Department of Energy in 2000, is charged 
with maintaining the current U.S. nuclear stockpile 
through the Stockpile Stewardship Program and has 
introduced the RRW as a long-term solution to stockpile 
maintenance. The “short-term” solution currently in 
place is a subset of the SSP, the Life Extension Program, 
which corrects problems and replaces components in 
deteriorating nuclear warheads, most of which were 
built in the 1970s and 1980s. Congress has observed a 
moratorium on nuclear testing since 1992, so the goal of 
the LEP is to rebuild the old warheads with components 
that resemble the ones being replaced as much as pos-
sible. The stockpile has been deemed safe and reliable for 
the past 11 years using this method.

The Fight Against Nuclear Development
However, the NNSA has raised concerns over the 

long-term reliability of the LEP, and is seeking to 
develop the RRW warhead, which the agency expects 
to be an improvement over the current stockpile in 
terms of security, safety and reliability. Officials believe 
the RRW can be taken to the production phase without 
nuclear testing. 

“What some people may or may not know is nuclear 
weapons don’t last forever,”  said LLNL Spokesperson 
David Schwoegler. “They either have to be repaired or 
replaced. And right now, the repairs are becoming ever 
more costly as the weapons age and the components 
become harder and harder to get … newer and safer 
is better and it doesn’t cost any more than refurbish-
ments.”

However, the RRW faces considerable 
opposition from nonproliferation groups. 

“There’s no evidence that weapons are 
declining in their usefulness just because you 
replace the part,” said Jason Isaacs, executive 
director at the Center for Arms Control and 
Non-Proliferation in Washington, D.C. “Our 
position is that the United States has many 
— too many — nuclear weapons as it is. Those 
weapons can last many, many more years. There 
have been recent National Academy of Science 
studies saying that the so-called ‘pit,’ the center 
of the warhead, can last a long time.”

Schwoegler said that although the pit prob-
ably has a lifespan of 80 to 100 years, other com-
ponents such as plastics, adhesives, electronics 

and boost gases have much shorter shelf lives. 
“There are over 1,000 interdependent parts 

of a nuclear weapon which must function 
flawlessly within a few trillionths of a second,” 
he said. “And if any of the others degrade, the 
weapon doesn’t work.”

Non-proliferation groups maintain that the 
NNSA’s criticism of the LEP is vague in its 
assertion that the program might, at some 
point in the future, lead to reduced confidence 
in the stockpile. The protest groups remain 
wary of the RRW being tested.

 “It’s not clear that the U.S. armed forces 
would ever accept this weapon without con-
ducting nuclear tests first,” Isaacs said. “We’re 
afraid that if we go ahead with this weapon, 

we’ll break out of our ban on testing new nucle-
ar weapons and conduct some explosive tests.”

LLNL proposes to avoid nuclear testing by 
basing the RRW on a previously tested model 
and using advanced computer simulations.

Schwoegler also cited several differences in 
today’s nuclear development compared to the 
development of the old Cold War-era warheads 
as a benefit to the RRW. 

“Since we’re now operating under reduced 
stockpile size, and in compliance with treaties, 
we don’t have to fit multiple warheads into a 
single military vehicle, we only have to fit one,” 
he said. “You can have a lot more safety, security

MONDAY, JANUARY 7, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  9

There are certain situations that a photographer knows are risky. Shooting grizzly bears or docu-
menting street-gang warfare, for exam-
ple, have their obvious hazards. But there 
is a subject that poses threats to the 
photographer that 
even he cannot see 
sharply through 
the lens. A child 
can seem inno-
cent enough, and 
could even make 
for some of the 
best pictures, but 
often lurking beyond the crop of a zoom 
lens is an overprotective parent, ready to 
pounce.

You never know when allegations 
of pedophilia are going to get thrown 
around. I’m sure it’s a rare occurrence, 
but with digital photography and the 
Internet allowing anyone access to mil-
lions of images, parents have more rea-
sons to be concerned than ever. Not only 
do they have to look out for perverts, but 
anyone with a camera is a threat unless 
the parent knows the pictures are going 
to be responsibly handled. Even other 
parents are suspect; a father with a cam-
era at the park might make it well known 
that he only intends to photograph his 
own child.

I don’t normally photograph a lot 
of children, but La Jolla is one of my 
favorite places to walk around with my 
camera when I’m short on creativity. 
On any given day, it’s  full of parents and 
their children. And with the future of 
Children’s Pool and its resident harbor 
seals a controversial issue right now, I’ve 
been tempted by the locale’s news value to 
document how people use the area. And 
it happens that children, so easily excited 
by this pack of sleepy marine mammals, 
provide some of the most interesting 
visual reactions to their environment.

Granted, the intensity of parents’ sus-
picions I’ve encountered is often far from 
the level directed toward sexual deviants, 
but I’ve still adopted several techniques 
to help me avoid trouble. First of all, I 
think what helps most is that I don’t look 

like a child molester. I look like a college 
kid, and sometimes I wear a UCSD shirt 
to emphasize this. An additional trick 
I employ is to act as if a child is just so 
adorable that his parent should be proud 
that I’m taking his picture. Never mind 

what it’s for — they can 
just think about the 
great genes they passed 
to their offspring, and I 
can move on to another 
subject. A related trick 
is to act like the pic-
ture is being taken on a 
whim, because the child 

is doing something funny and particu-
larly noteworthy; the chances are good 
that the parents think their child is note-
worthy as well. It helps to laugh in this 
type of situation. Sometimes, though, 
there is no time for disguises and the best 
method is to be transparent. Sometimes 
I’ve crouched down right at the parents’ 
feet to take a picture of their child.

More often, though, I try to take the 
picture and move on before anyone real-
izes what I’m doing. It also certainly helps 
to disguise the fact that I’ve been watch-
ing people for several minutes, waiting 
for the right moment. This is a technique 
I use with subjects of all ages. It’s worth 
the time I would otherwise have to spend 
explaining what I’m doing — time spent 
not taking photos. It has failed, though, 
as it did recently when I found a young 
girl watching the seals at Children’s Pool. 
She was some distance away from her 
mother, and when she saw me take a 
picture she sounded the alarm: “Mommy, 
he took my picture!”

My heart pounded away the seconds 
between the girl revealing my covert 
shooting and her mother finally smiling 
at me in acceptance. I smiled and waved 
before I quickly shuffled off in the oppo-
site direction. Until the day I head into 
the wilderness to shoot a roaring grizzly 
bear, I’ll wonder if taking pictures of chil-
dren can be anymore nerve-wracking.

SITE SEEN Continent European and Russian Delicatessen
S quished between a dentist’s office and a dry cleaner’s in a corporate building off of Regents Road, Continent European and Russian 
Delicatessen is a colorful and atypical eatery with 
an edge over the typical deli or supermarket. Owned 
and run by Edward Serper and Irina Kanevsky 
— two Ukrainian immigrants who opened their 
first store on University Avenue in 1995 — it offers 
an overwhelming variety of Eastern European prod-
ucts, ranging from luxuriously packaged chocolates 
to Russian greeting cards and calendars. 

The store’s walls are decorated with intricately 
painted teapots and native dolls but are largely 
dominated by shelves crowded with brightly-pack-
aged foodstuffs. Among the foreign teas, sauces and 
Nutella are intriguing gems such as “Magic Sticks” 
cereal (the Russian breakfast answer to 50 Cent’s 
pop hit), bins of candy pieces individually bundled 
in lobster-printed wrappers (fortunately, these can-
dies aren’t lobster-flavored), and canned cod liver. 
Despite some of its more eccentric products, the 
deli’s stock of refreshing Eastern European products 
like Kvass — a semi-alcoholic beverage made from 
fermented rye bread and flavored with fruit — are 
reason enough to visit.

In addition to its selection of groceries, Continent 
also features a deli, where customers can find a 
vast selection of salami, smoked bacon, fresh royal 
salmon and sausage. Complementary goods such 
as cheeses (litousky, gouda and bajuval, to name a 
few) and rye bread complete the package. Those 
looking for food sans the assembly can check out the 
home-cooked, ready-to-serve counter, which offers 
European dishes such as stuffed mushrooms, egg-
plant salad or piroghki. For dessert, customers can 
pick up an apple turnover, or indulge in a decadent 
piece of cake. Seating is offered inside and outside 
the deli, making it an ideal place for a lunch date or 
cram session.

With its imported goodies, fresh cuts and 
European charm, Continent offers a delectable 
international experience close to home, or at the 
very least, a chance to learn some Russian.

MONDAY, JANUARY 7, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  11

By Millie Seibold
Contributing Writer

This quarter, as hordes of stu-
dents shuffle into giant lecture halls 
and slam their tablets over their 
laps in preparation for another lec-
ture, students enrolled in Derek 
Lomas’ “Developing Technologies 
for Developing Economies” practi-
cum will gather in the Cal-(IT)2 
building’s visual arts space, settle 
in comfy chairs, learn about world 
issues and begin devising ways to 
solve problems in developing coun-
tries through innovative technol-
ogy. Considering the class’ hands-
on approach, it is surprising to 
learn that its creator, Derek Lomas, 
a Cal-(IT)2 graduate student, is 
teaching the Winter Quarter class 
from Mumbai, India. 

Lomas, who initially traveled 
to India in July 2007 to work for 
Qualcomm with two other UCSD 
interns, stayed to conduct research, 
but was also inspired to design a 
course relating to important inter-
national concerns.

“This class was created in 
response to real world issues,” 
Lomas said. “It is not easy to come 
up with a class relevant to current 
events.” 

Lomas created the class in order 
to emphasize that technological 
change can also bring about eco-
nomic and social change, and to 
raise undergraduate and graduate 
students’ interest in helping third 
world countries. While some stu-
dents may have connections to the 
developing world through family or 

friends, many are largely detached 
and uninformed about the simple 
difficulties that third world coun-
tries face, such as finding clean 
water. To combat this, Lomas will 
take advantage of his firsthand 
experiences and resources in India, 
and, through modern technology, 
use observations and interviews 
with native Indians to expose the 
country’s way of life to students. 
Lomas does not see his in-class 
absence as a disadvantage. Rather, 
he plans to use his position in 
India to enhance the class material 
and give his students an in-depth 
understanding of the people they 
will make innovative solutions for. 

Teaching a class from a country 
halfway around the world is not as 
difficult or as complicated as it may 
seem. Thanks to the Internet and 
Apple technology, Lomas will be 
able to hold live video conferences 
with his class once a week. With 
his remote desktop, Lomas can also 
share files, photos and videos that 
students will view on a widescreen 
Mac. During the course, Lomas 
will alternate between holding live 
lectures from India, showing pre-
recorded videos of guest Indian 
speakers and facilitating class dis-
cussions.  

“Distance education doesn’t 
have to just make up for someone 
not being there,” Lomas said. “It 
can actually be a benefit because it 
can provide firsthand experiences.”

In the experimental course, stu-
dents will not only have the chance 
to watch interviews with Indians, 
but they will also be able to expe-
rience the daily lives of everyday 
natives such as truck drivers, veg-
etable pickers and shopkeepers. To 
facilitate this, Lomas’ interviewees 
will wear a special pair of sun-
glasses that work like a camcorder 
before taking part in a normal day’s 

activities. These videos will then be 
edited, compiled and shown to the 
students. By actually stepping into 
other people’s lives, Lomas hopes 
that his students will become more 
globally aware and conscious of the 
problems and poverty that develop-
ing countries face. 

“There is not a whole lot of 
knowledge about how other peo-
ple live,” Lomas said. “Because of 
globalization, it is important that 
we can compare life here to life 
in undeveloped countries. Being 
aware involves more than joining a 
‘Save Darfur’ group on Facebook or 
donating money to a cause.”

Through their understanding of 
third world issues, students will be 
better able to design a technological 
solution to better meet the needs of 
developing economies. While the 
main criteria of this project require 
students to conduct research and 
evaluate how their invention will 
assist the lives of third world citi-
zens, the product design and its 
marketability is limited only to the 
students’ imaginations and ambi-
tions. Although it is unlikely that 
the students’ inventions will be 
mass marketed, a successful inven-
tion is nevertheless based on cre-
ativity.  

Although Lomas’ course is an 
example of a unique and differ-
ent approach to education, dis-
tance-learning classes are actually 
commonplace in the state’s higher 
education system. For example, 
UCSD extension offers over 2,000 
Internet-based and hybrid classes, 
combinations of Internet and tra-
ditional courses. Although it may 
seem impractical to take a non-
traditional course, these types of 
classes have helped undergradu-
ates and non-degree seeking peo-
ple achieve their educational goals. 
Henry DeVries, the UCSD exten-

sion director of com-
munications, sees this as 
a growing and valuable 
resource.

“As the cost of tech-
nology rapidly falls, you 
will see the continued 
rise of distance learning, 
especially for adult learn-
ers,” DeVries said. “This 
is a chance for students 
from across the nation and 
around the globe to have 
access to the top minds in 
the field.”

While Internet-based 
classes are designed for 
people to learn whenever 
and wherever it is con-
venient for them, hybrid 
classes like Derek Lomas’ 
involve a unique integra-
tion of class meetings 
and online resources 
to create an enhanced 
learning environ-
ment.

“I think that the 
professor is setting a 
great example in how 
the classroom can 
use technology,” 
said Sixth College 
senior Kristen 
Shimatsu, who 
plans to take the 
class. “I think that 
his dedication and 
good use of modern 
technology makes 
up for how he isn’t 
physically there. 
If anything, he is 
adapting to the stu-
dents’ lives and the 
technology that sur-
rounds us.”

and use control features.”
According to the NNSA fact sheet 

on the RRW, the safety and use con-
trol features include “greatly reduced 
hazardous waste, reduced quantities of 
nuclear material and modern security 
features added to render [the weapon] 
useless in the wrong hands.” 

Facing Heightened Scrutiny
Isaacs also pointed out the diplo-

matic hypocrisy he believes the RRW 
would create, a position espoused by 
Congress when they cut funding for the 
project in December. 

“If we’re trying to tell other countries 
like North Korea and Iran they can’t 
develop nuclear weapons, we should 
not be producing our own,” he said.

Although the NNSA maintains that 
the RRW meets U.S. nonproliferation 
commitments because it will allow for 
further stockpile reductions, accord-
ing to Isaacs, there has been no similar 
commitments made on the part of 
the Pentagon, by the Department of 
Energy or by the White House.

Nonproliferation groups also 
point out that the RRW would have 
“birth defects” that could require a 
larger stockpile, whereas most defects 
have been eliminated from the current 
stockpile after long years of testing.

Some nonproliferation groups, like 
the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, not 
only oppose the development of nucle-

ar weapons, but also the involvement of 
the UC system in said development.

UC Nuclear Free is a campaign 
run by the NAPF-sponsored Coalition 
to Demilitarize the UC system. The 
UC Nuclear Free Web site claims the 
university’s primary function as a 
management agency is to provide a 
“smokescreen” of academic integrity. It 
states, “As a 1970 UC Academic Senate 
committee put it, the UC essentially 
serves as a ‘benevolent absentee land-
lord’ with respect to LANL and LLNL: 
Its ‘management’ of the facilities creates 
an illusion that the labs’ programs are 
being monitored, when, in reality, the 
UC has absolutely no influence over 
these programs.”

According to Steve Stormoen, the 
Youth Outreach Initiative Coordinator 
for NAPF, the goal of the Coalition 
to Demilitarize the UC is to push the 
university to sever ties and end man-
agement of their nuclear weapons labs 
Los Alamos and Livermore, which are 
responsible for the development of 
every single nuclear weapon in the U.S. 
stockpile. The student coalition has 
active members on six UC campuses, 
including UCSD, Stormoen said.

The coalition held a nine-day hun-
ger strike in May 2007 that culmi-
nated with a 100-person presence at 
the UC Board of Regents meeting that 
month, as well as a cross-campus dem-
onstration in November to protest the 
university’s bid for the weapons labs. 

The student-led group also organized a 
10-week class at UC Santa Cruz called 
“UC and the Bomb.”

“People responded really positive-
ly,” said one UC and the Bomb class 
facilitator who asked not to be named. 
“I think honestly the first step to … 
affecting change in a major way is edu-
cating the students and getting more 
people involved. I think that effort has 
been going slowly, as things go, but is 
successful. The coalition definitely has 
something to show for it.”

The Next Step for Protest Groups
The coalition’s next action is sched-

uled to be at the January regents meet-
ing, Stormoen said. 

Isaacs’ nonproliferation group will 
also continue to oppose the RRW in  
Washington, D.C. 

“I suspect the administration will 
request funds once again for the RRW 
in the new budget presented in about a 
month, so our duty is to oppose that,” 
he said.

Congress’ options for FY2009 
include allowing the RRW project 
to proceed to the next phase with 
funding, pausing the project, slowing 
it down or canceling it completely. 
Congress has yet to make a final deci-
sion on the fate of the warhead devel-
opment.

new look stem from this increasing 
change of pace, he added. 

“We realized that we needed some 
new vibrancy, more images and the 
ability to have our home page convey 
the most up-to-date information and 
news, so that students, faculty, staff 
and visitors could make informed 
and timely decisions,” Schottlander 
said. “We needed to update our site 
but also adapt to the ever-changing 
nature of the Web itself.”

A number of students have 
praised the redesigned Web site, 
calling the changes both necessary 
and effective. 

“The new site looks less cluttered, 
which makes it easier to navigate,” 
Thurgood Marshall College junior 
Elaine Li said. “It also simply looks 
better. The redesign was a well-
needed change.” 

The improved navigability stems 
directly from a simplified system of 
“audience entry points,” appearing 
as horizontal tabs that allow access 
to categories such as “current stu-
dents” and “topical entry points,” 
which appear on the vertical option 
bar with choices such as “apply” 
and “explore.” The Web site boasts 
consistent placement of these entry 
points on each redesigned page, 

lending an easier understanding of 
how the site functions as a whole. 

While individual UCSD depart-
ment Web sites remain unchanged, 
members of each department will 
begin receiving training in a content 
management system in March. The 
system will contain coding for the 
same design as the main page.

Schottlaender said that those 
surveyed considered user-friendly 
simplification to be one of the most 
desired changes to the old UCSD 
Web site.

“All of our audience groups are 
looking for information and want to 
find what they’re looking for quickly 
and easily,” he said.

Users are encouraged to e-mail 
their comments about the new site 
through a link located on the bottom 
of each page. Separate departments 
and committees are responsible for 
monitoring user responses and act-
ing on any problems that may arise.

Schottlaender said the system has 
already been used to fix small bugs, 
and developers are currently refin-
ing the Google search mechanism, 
enhancing page display and modify-
ing code for various browsers.

double-digit margin and left UCSD at 
5-2 on the season, with all five straight 
victories coming at home. The Tritons 
never trailed in either contest, shooting 
an incredible 55 percent in both wins 
and holding their opponents below 60 
points. Both squads fell to 6-6 on the 
year following the road losses. 

“Playing five straight home games 
has given [the team] the confidence 
we need to take our winning streak on 
the road,” said junior guard Andrew 
Hatch. “Also, I can attribute our win-
ning streak to not being overly prac-
ticed during the week. Last year and 
previous years, we played games when 
we were less than 100 percent. This 
year, because of the practice schedules, 
we are able to approach each game 
healthy and prepared.”

Against Wayne State, the Tritons 
were able to open a double-digit lead 
in the first half. The Wildcats, having 
traveled from Nebraska, were able to 
remain in striking distance throughout 
the half, going into the intermission 

ended, the Tritons found themselves 
down 33-21, a manageable deficit con-
sidering the extent of the team’s shoot-
ing woes. 

Senior forward Meaghan Noud 
opened up the second half by sinking 
a three-point shot, cutting Humboldt 
State’s lead down to single digits. 
However, the Lumberjacks continued 
their balanced offensive attack, work-
ing hard for points in the paint and 
effectively shooting long-range jump 
shots, which left the Tritons little room 
to come back.

While its defense struggled, UCSD’s 
offense picked up the pace after half-
time, with Noud scoring 12 quick 
points in the second half. Unfortunately 
for the Tritons, the offensive efforts 
proved to be too little too late against 
Humboldt State, leaving UCSD with a 
70-52 defeat.

UCSD shot 39 percent from the 
field, including a mere 32 percent in 
the first half. Noud was the leading 
scorer for the Tritons, contributing 25 
points as no other Tritons scored in 
double digits.

The Tritons faced Sonoma State  on 
the road one day earlier and once again 
found themselves playing catch-up. 
The game remained close in the first 
half as both teams fell victim to poor 
shooting. The Tritons held on because 
of their three-pointers, shooting 4-of-9 
from behind the arc to make up for 
their offensive struggles elsewhere on 
the floor. 

The teams went back and forth

Strong Start Negated by 
Recent Road Struggles

▶ W. BASKETBALL, from page 16 throughout the first half and the 
Seawolves entered the break holding 
onto a 25-22 lead.

In the second half, the Tritons con-
tinued their shooting struggles while 
Sonoma State’s offense improved. The 
Seawolves attacked the offensive glass, 
earning offensive rebounds that led to 
second-chance points and drew several 
fouls. In contrast, the Tritons settled for 
jump shots and only earned one free-
throw attempt the entire game. 

The Tritons only managed to shoot 
30 percent from the field in the game 
with junior forward Michelle Osier and 
senior center Alexis Gaskin each net-
ting 12 points to lead the team.

After starting out their season 
with a perfect 8-0 record, the Tritons 
suffered their first loss to Central 
Washington University at the Western 
Washington University Shootout on 
Dec. 18. The Tritons followed up 
that loss with a victory over Western 
Washington University, the first of 
two wins over the Vikings this season. 
UCSD’s only other loss before the 
recent CCAA road losses was against 
Seattle Pacific University on Dec. 28 
by a score of 75-65. 

“Right now we need to focus on 
our gameplan and get ready for next 
weekend,” Elliott said.

The Tritons will take their 10-4 
record on the road against CSU 
Dominguez Hills on Jan. 11 and CSU 
Los Angeles on Jan. 12.

down by eight. 
UCSD stepped up its play on both 

ends of the court coming out of the 
half, limiting Wayne State to only two 
points over the first four minutes of the 
second half and doubling the Triton 
advantage. The Wildcats would get no 
closer than 12 points the rest of the 
way as UCSD shot an astonishing 66.7 
percent from the field and led by as 
much as 21. Carlson was able to play 13 
Tritons in the contest, with nine mem-
bers of the team scoring in the 73-point 
output, UCSD’s highest of the sea-
son. Junior forwards Patterson, Darryl 
Lawlor and Shane Poppen led the way 
for the Tritons, as Patterson and Lawlor 
scored 19 and 14 points respectively 
and Poppen grabbed a game-high nine 
rebounds in 18 minutes off the bench. 
As a team, the Tritons won both the 
battle on the boards, 31-28, and the 
turnover deficit, 13-17.

UCSD got off to another hot start 
against William Jewell, a trend it has 
displayed throughout the season, scor-
ing the first eight points of the game

and holding a double-digit lead less 
than two and a half minutes into the 
game. The staunch Triton defense 
allowed only six points in the first 
nine-and-a-half minutes of the game 
as UCSD led by as much as 17 in the 
opening half, converting on 56.5 per-
cent of their field goal attempts. The 
Cardinals, on the road from Missouri, 
were unable to combat UCSD on either 
end, getting no closer than nine points 
and shooting only 30.8 percent from 
the field in the second half. Meanwhile, 
the Tritons again converted over half 
their field goal attempts in the half and 
out rebounded the Cardinals 34-25 in 
the game, cruising to the 19-point win. 

Patterson, junior guard Kelvin Kim 
and senior guard Clint Allard led the 
scoring with 13, 12 and 11 points, 
respectively. Allard equaled the entire 
output of William Jewell with his game-
high eight assists, while Poppen was 
UCSD’s leader on the boards with 11 
rebounds in 19 minutes as a reserve.

HOT CORNER

MONDAY, JANUARY 7, 2008

It’s been almost a month since former senator George Mitchell unleashed a 409-page bombshell 
on Major League Baseball and its com-
munity of players, coaches, admin-
istrators and fans. The shocking rev-
elation uncovered by the diligent ex-
politician: baseball players have been 
using performance-enhancing drugs, 
and the use of banned substances was 
prevalent among utility players like 
Neifi Perez and sure-thing Hall of 
Famers like Roger 
Clemens.

For the average 
citizen who hasn’t 
seen more than a 
minute of base-
ball over the last 
decade, this may 
come as a shock; 
but to those who have followed the 
sport with any consistency, this is 
about as newsworthy and unexpected 
as Britney’s latest mental breakdown. 
Proof of F.P. Santangelo’s usage sur-
prised me, but only because I figured 
someone with as useless a career as his 
must have been honest and clean.

Although the names that Mitchell 
dropped were hardly impressive, the 
Mitchell Report was not an entire waste 
of time. Well, actually the report was, 
but the aftermath was not. In a press 
conference organized by Bud Selig, 
the MLB commissioner stood behind 
a podium and addressed the urgent 
questions that the nation’s top sports 
journalists had. He appeared somewhat 
eloquent and distinguished for a few 
questions until a reporter asked about a 
specific part of the report. In response, 
the commissioner of baseball admitted 
that he had not read the report and 
that he had only been briefed on its 
contents.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!
This man is paid almost $15 mil-

lion a year to run a sport, a job I would 
kill for, and can’t find the time to read 
the most important document on the 
most pressing subject at the most cru-
cial time during his tenure. 

I would argue that while no one 
person can be blamed for the sad state 

of affairs in baseball today, if I had to 
put one person on the chopping block 
it would be Selig. While the lack of 
a salary cap is a debate for another 
day, his main shortcoming has been 
his decision to turn a blind eye to the 
corruption in the sport because Mark 
McGwire and Sammy Sosa hugging 
on the front page of every newspaper 
in 1998 made baseball the $6 billion 
enterprise it is today. However, when 
it became clear that steroid use was 

not a fad and that 
it had taken over 
the sport, Selig 
turned into a dili-
gent baseball sher-
iff, ready to kick ass 
in the morning and 
take names in the 
evening.

His first step: hiring the former 
senator to lead an independent inves-
tigation to uncover the dirty truths 
behind the sport. I don’t know why 
anyone expected a MLB-sponsored 
report to uncover any real scandals, 
but I think I speak for all fans when I 
say that the man who commissioned 
the report should be responsible for 
reading it as well.

While his press conference was 
held only hours after the Mitchell 
Report was released to the public, Selig 
must have received it at least a week 
in advance, during a time when no 
baseball was being played — and he 
couldn’t cram in some serious reading 
time? I was in the middle of studying 
for finals when the document came 
out and I found the time to skim it, but 
Bud couldn’t find an Adderall hookup 
and pull an all-nighter so he could 
actually be prepared for his own press 
conference and appear like a capable 
commissioner.

This is the last straw. For years, 
Selig has seemed out of his league. 
Maybe the Pacific Coast League could 
use a new leader or maybe Selig should 
just retire with his millions and expand 
his collection of tweed blazers. Either 
way, he should not preside over a sport 
that is in desperate need of some revo-
lutionary changes.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — After 
starting out the season with a perfect 
8-0 record, the No. 12 UCSD women’s 
basketball team has struggled as of 
late, losing four of its last six games to 
enter the significant part of the Tritons’ 
CCAA sched-
ule with an 
overall record 
of 10-4. The 
Tritons’ latest 
loss came at 
Humboldt State on Jan. 5, when they 
were blown out by 18 points. Just a day 
earlier, the Tritons took their third loss 
by another embarrassing margin, los-
ing 58-41 to Sonoma State University 
on Jan. 4. With the two losses coming 
against CCAA teams, UCSD’s confer-
ence record falls to 2-2, a major disap-
pointment given the high expectations 
surrounding the talented team heading 
into the season.

“We had a tough weekend,” head 
coach Charity Elliott said. “We’re trying 
to get back to basics after a couple of 
tough games.”

UCSD managed to keep pace with 
Humboldt State for the first seven 
minutes of the game despite missing 
several key shot attempts. The poor 
shooting caught up to the Tritons mid-
way through the first half, however, 
as Humboldt State began an offensive 
push that UCSD had no answer for. 
With the score 8-7 in favor of Humboldt 
State and 13:36 left in the first half, the 
Lumberjacks went on a 11-0 run that 
spanned nearly five minutes to put the 
Tritons down by 12 points. 

UCSD’s shooting struggles contin-
ued throughout the half, including a 
span in which the Tritons missed seven 
straight field goal attempts and two free 
throw attempts. When the first half

MEN’S BASKETBALL — After win-
ning a close contest against the Sonoma 
State Seawolves on Jan. 4 to push its 
program-best Division II win streak to 
six games, the UCSD men’s basketball 
team saw that streak end with an 80-69 
loss at Humboldt State, the team’s first 
loss since November. The loss put the 
Tritons into a three-way tie for second 
place in the CCAA standings with their 
3-1 mark.

The Lumberjacks also hold the 
same 3-1 mark, and came back from 
a double-digit deficit to put a stop 
to UCSD’s win streak. Although the 
Tritons were up by as much as 16 points 
in the first half, Humboldt State was 
able to start its comeback late in the 
first half and entered the break trailing 
by only six points, 45-39. 

“You always feel good about hav-
ing a lead on the road especially in an 
atmosphere like that where they get 
loud” head coach Chris Carlson said.

increased as Humboldt State’s momen-
tum carried into the second half, where 
the Lumberjacks took a 55-54 lead that 
they would not relinquish over the final 
14 minutes of the game. The 80 points 
scored by the Lumberjacks were the 
most the Tritons had allowed all sea-
son, and 20 of those points came from 
the free throw line.

While the Tritons were outscored 
from the charity stripe, they did shoot 
well in the game, notching shooting 
percentages of over 50 percent from the 
field and from behind the three-point 
arc as well. The smart shooting was 
negated by the free throw points and by 
UCSD’s 13 turnovers compared to the 
Lumberjacks’ three. Humboldt State 
took advantage of the sloppy play, scor-
ing 16 points off of the 13 turnovers.

“We always talk about valuing each 
possession,” Carlson said. “It’s always 
been a part of our success. We certainly 
didn’t do that in the second half but it’s 
something we’ll learn from.”

Just a day earlier, the Tritons com-
mitted 18 turnovers but came away 
with their sixth straight win, 58-54 at 
Sonoma State University. UCSD was 
rolling in the second half, leading by 
17 points at one point, but allowed the 
Seawolves to creep closer late in the 
game. Sonoma State went on a 10-0 run 
in the final four minutes, but UCSD 
iced the game with eight consecutive 
free throws in the final 46 seconds.

“[Hitting those free throws] was 
good for us because we hadn’t been 
shooting well from the line,” Carlson 
said. “It’s something we had talked 
about and 
worked on 
in practice. 
So to see the 
improvement 
really proves 
that this team can learn and progress. 
Those free throws down the stretch 
were huge for us.”

Sophomore guard Jordan Lawley 
led the Tritons with 21 points in 28 
minutes and shot exceptionally well 
from all over the floor. Lawley shot 8-
of-12 from the field, including 2-of-2 
from behind the arc, and also made 
three of his four free-throw attempts. 

“The real key with Jordan is he’s 
hitting his shots and getting his points 
within our offense,” Carlson said. “So 
from him to have a high shooting per-
centage is encouraging, not only right 
now but for the future as well.”

While the record win streak has 
officially ended, the Tritons had a 
December to remember. The Tritons 
defeated William Jewell College by a 
70-51 margin on Dec. 16 and then 
took down Wayne State by a 73-59 
margin on Dec. 18. The wins were the 
third and fourth straight victories by a
