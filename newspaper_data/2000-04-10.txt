THE HAGUE, Netherlands -
Confounding the many critics who 
Jong called the international tri-
bunal here a mere fig leaf for 
Western shame, the court dealing 
with Yugoslav war crimes has just 
completed an extraordinary month . 

It has opened the first U.N. trial 
ever to focus excl usively on sexual 
violence against women, including 
gang rape and the use of women as 
sexual slaves as part of a war strategy. 

It has begun the trial of one of 
the top generals alleged to be 
responsible for the carnage in 1995

Asian Pacific 
Islander Group 
Leaps to UCSD 
Concluding a 12 -city tour, 
L.E.A.P. brought a race 
relations discussion to campus 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Staff Writer 

UCSD hosted a roundtable discussion 
titled "The State of Asian Pacific Amenca: 
Transforming Race Relations· last 
Wednesday in the Price Center. 

The discussion featured Leadership 
Education for Asian Pacifics, an Asian 
Pacific American organization, also known 
as L.E.A.P. 

San Diego marked the final destination 
for L.E.A.P.'s 12-city U.S. tour, which began 
in Washington, D.C. at a national press con-
ference and later tncluded cities such as 
New York, Boston, Miami and Chicago. It 
was the second time UCSD has hosted the 
event. 

The panel of speakers at the roundtable 
discussion included J.D. Hokoyama, presi-
dent of L.E.A.P.; Edward j.W Park, director 
of the Asian Pacific American Studies 
Program at Loyola Marymount University; 
Yen Le Espiritu, professor of ethnic studies 
at UCSD; and Leland Saito, associate pro-
fessor of ethnic studies department at 
UCSD. 

A series of four topics \,Vere addressed by 
each of the speakers. First, the speakers 
introduced the audience to the Asian Pacific 
American challenge to race relations. 
Second, there was a segment on racial iden-
tities, classifications and the 2000 census. 
Third, the speakers discussed racial interac-
tions and hate crimes. Finally, there was a 
segment on national race policies and 
Affirmative Action . Finally, new possibilities 
and multiracial collaborations and coali-
tions were discussed. 

Hokoyama began the roundtable agenda 
with an introduction to the present state of 
Asian Pacific Americans in the United 
States. He referred to such recent incidents 
such as Sen. John McCain's reference to 
Vietnamese Americans as "gooks: citing it 
as a' chilling reminder of the continued rele-

'Hilmar Kaiser, from the· European Uiziversity Institute in Florence, presented new evidence of crimes 
By BBBCA WOOD 
Staff Writer 

Gennan scholar Hilmar Kaiser 
introduced for the tirst-time 
archival evidence of Shultru Kaya's 
involvement in the Annenian 
genocide at UCSO's Institute of 
the Americas auditorium on April 
5. 

During April 1915, in what il 
now the Republic of Thrkq, 1.5 
million Annenians were massa-
cred in the Armenian genocide. 

Kaiser, a professor at the 
European University Institute in 
Florence, Italy, explained how the 
Ar.rnen.ian deportation . to concco-

tration camps was planned and led 
by Kaya, director of the settlement 
of immigrants. 

°Kaya was an expert on social 
engineering and movement of 
populations," Kaiser said. "Kaya's 
role was similar to Eichmann's in 
the Holocaust.~ 

He said there are campaigns 
underway to deny that the 
Annenian genocide happened. 

As in the United States, "free-
dom of speech includes denial." 
Kaiser said. 

He explained that economic 
motivations are behind the denial. 

Kaiser also said the Holocaust, 
a1thOl,lgh it did,. not occur until 

years later, "served as the most 
important singular concept of 
genocide.~ 

Kaiser also said that only about 
5 percent of the work needed to 
uncover the atrocities of the 
Annenian genocide was actually 
done. 

In his lecture, Kaiser also 
explained the mechanics of the 
cnmes and attempted to clarify' 
ideological explanation of the 
genocide. 

"It wasn't the threat of the 
Islamic religion that motivated the 
Thrks." he said. 

Kaiser said he grew up in an 
t:thnically diverse Thrkisb , neigh-, 

borhood in Germany and wit-
nessed his community'S denial of 
the ~enocide, which was a motiva-
tion for his work. 

Kaiser did extensive archival 
research and is a specialist on the 
Armenian genocide and Ottoman-
German relations. He has also 
written numerous pieces on the 
the topic of the Armenian geno-
cide. 

The lecture was hosted by the 
departments of history and sociol-
ogy and the Armenian Student 
Association . There will be an 
annual international commemora-
tion of the Armenian genocide 
April 24.

Fire: 
University said incident is 
still under investigation 
ContInIIed froIII tNCe 1 
tigation by University of Iowa 
Public Safety, she said . Rhodes 
said she did not know whether the 
student who received the e-mail 
was a member of a minority group 
or if the e-mail was threatening in 
tone. 

The fire broke out just before 10 
a.m., when a lab coat apparently was 
ignited by a Bunsen burner, said Steve 
Parrott, the director of university rela-
tions. 

The fire was put Ollt by a dental 
student who lIsed a fire extinguish-
er, and nobody was injured, Parrott 
said . The Iowa City Fire 

D~partment responded to an alarm , 
but the fire had already been put 
out by the time firefighters got 
there, he said. . . 

The group claiming responsibility 
for the fire goes by four names -
Minoirtyrid (sic). Minoritygctout. the 
Committee of Minority Flight and 
Minorityout - none of which inves-
tigators have found to be recognized 
hate groups. 
. Uni,·ersity of Iowa officials said 
the Incident was under investiga-
lion and wert! not releasing any 
additional information on th e mat-
ter Thursday evening. They also 
would not speculate whether the 
Incident was the responsibility of.

LOS A GELES - While stu-
dents on the East Coast are voicing 
their dissent of sweatshops through 
protests and sit-ins, UCLA will host a 
Students Against Sweatshops confer~ 
cnee this Saturday. 

The purpose of the statewide con-
ference is to urge universities to join 
the Workers Rights Consortium. a 
group of universities aligned to mon-
itor what goes on at factories where 
college apparel and goods come from, 
said Arlen Benjamin-Gomez, the 
organizer of Students Against 
Sweatshops at UCLA. 

Although many students on the 
East Coast are staging protests to get 
their universities to join the WRC, 
UCLA has already established a 
code of conduct regarding sweat-
shops. Conditions in factories that 
produce UCLA clothing are moni-
tored by Business for Social 
Responsibility, a consortium led by 
Harvard University. according to 
UCLA's code of conduct for 
licensees. 

Founded a year ago, the WRC 
joined another organization. the Fair 
Labor Association, in trying to curb 
sweatshop behavior. Since it was 
founded. universities such as Brown 
University. the University of ew 
Orleans and Oberlin College have 
joined.

CHARLOTIESVllLE, Va. -
University of Georgia officials said the 
death of Georgia sophomore

to a fraternity hazing incident. 

Grantham, an Alpha Tau Omega

a fellow fraternity member when 
the vehicle flipped over and hit a 
tree. 

Four other ATO pledges who also

u 
ast summer, with two 

makeshift computers. 
a large sack of white 
rice and one solid 
idea, four friends set 
out to change the 

world' of computer 
programming. ine 

months later, their com-
pany, mohomine, has 

received over $1 million in funding and 
controls one of most powerful search 
cngines on the Internet. 

On a whim, the four computer sci-
ence majors, three from UCSD and 
one from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 
took a chance and decided not to take 
the internships they had lined up. 
Instead, they pooled their resources 
and began programming. 

"We really thought the idea was 
solid. We thought it was solid from a 
technical standpoint and we thought it 
was solid from the perspective of 'Hey, 
this could be a real business,'" said 
Sameer Samat, chief technical officer 
and co-founder of mohomine. "We took 
whatever money we had in the bank and 
bought whatever equipment we could at 
the time, which wasn't a whole lot, and 
started building this thing." 

By Aug. 1 of last year, the entrepre-
neurs had successfully created and 
launched www.sourcebank.com. a search 
engine designed to help software 
developers track down reusable source 
code - instructions written for a com-
puter program in a particular program-
ming language - and research papers 
on any given subject. 

According to Sourcebank's Web 
site, it is a vertical portal run by 
mohomine's customized search tech-
nology (mohoEngine™) that "relies on 
a set of'spiders' and 'harvesters' to spi-
der-targeted portions of the Net." 

Unlike typical search engines, 
mohoEngine™ has "spiders" and har-

~esters that preserve the properties 
Inherent to the resources they gather. 
This means that Java source files are 
not handled the same way as a Web site 
or research paper. The mohoEngine™ 
backend knows that each file type has 
structural and content differences that 
can help provide more useful informa-
tion for searching source code and 
other domain specific documents. 

The problems the students encoun-
tered searching for and finding source 
code to reuse for their class assignments 

prompted them to create a search

"There's a lot of code out there and 

especially at a time when developing 
software is s() expensive, reusing code 
is great: Samat said. "At the same 
time, software reuse seems really hard, 
because finding source code out there 
is next to impossible, especially a year 
ago. 

It was like a loightmare. We heard 
"reuse code" in school, and then when 
we got home on our machinC'5, it was 
like 'Where do we go?' There had to be 
a better answer. The general search 
engines really weren't helping at all. 
They're not designed to go after this 
kind of stuff. they're not designed to 
find this stuff. That's how we got start-
ed."

The four students have k~own each 
other for some time. 

"I've known Josh Dammeier, who is 
one of the UCSD students, since sec-
ond grade," Samat said. · We went to 
middle school and high school togeth-
er, and he was my roommate in college 
first year. Chris Harris, the other UCSD 
student, we met on the first day of col-
lege.Josh and I did. He was our suitem-
ate. He was particularly loud, so we had 
to meet him. We've been friends ever 
since. Sean Brady, who is a Cal Poly stu-
dent, I've k'nown since first grade." 

The three UCSD students are all 
Muir students. Harris is from 
Sacramento and the other team mem-
bers hail from San Jose. 

In the beginning, Sourcebank was 
driven and owned by Revolution9, a 
limited liability company also started 
by the students last summer. Shortly 
after the launch of Sourcebank, the 
students sent out a press release telling 
the world about their technology, and 
their company took off. 

The next day was the beginning of 
their success. 

"The phone really rang. Constantly: 
Samat said. "The interest in doing 
source code search was overwhelming. 
We released the press release. I went to 
sleep, and the next morning when I 
woke up at around 11 a.m., I had eight 
or nine messages on my voice mail from 
various venture capital firms, lots of dif-
ferent partnership opportunities basi-
cally saying, 'Here's a lot of money. 
What do yOu want to 90 with it?' We 
were pretty much shell-shocked. We 
weren't asking for money. So, when we 
got these calls, we really didn't have a 
strategy to deal with them." 

For the next three months, they 

went through a process of deciding the 
fate of Rcvolution9 a.nd Sourcebank. 
Several times the comPany was close to 
a merger, but the deals didn't offer 
them exactly what they ~anted, said 
Samat. 

"Sure, the financial component was 
there, but . really when the question 
came up, 'So where is the technology 
going? Are we going to be able to make 
the product that we feel really stands 
out in the marketplace and exercises 
the skills that we have? Basically, are 
we going to be doing something cool 
or not?' The answer was sort of mud-
dled. We weren't getting the right 
answers." 

After mulling over the constrictive 
offers with his three colleagu!!s, Samat 
began looking for answers. He spoke 
to a close friend who is "pretty high 
up" at one of the big search engines 
interested in buying Revolution9. 

·We sat down, and he basically gave 
me the advice, 'You don't want t9 sell 
this thing. You want to really think 
about getting some money:" 

For the first time, Samat and his co-
founders thought about holding on to 
~heir company and looking for 
Investors.

The Editor's Soapbox 
Those who fail to stop others who perpetrate hostility support it and reinforce it themselves 
Editor in Chief 

I've been accused my whole life 
of just not "getting it" when it 
comes to sexual insults. I don't 
think it's funny to joke that aggres-
sive women are "dykes" or that 
men in committed relationships 
are "pussy-whipped." 

Every time I don't laugh at sex-
ual insults, I'm told that I'm uptight 
or no fun . Well, perhaps I'm crazy, 
but I don't think that an essential 
part of having fun is hurting peo-
ple. Sexual remarks have real con-
sequences, ones that those who 
deliver them can't always see. 

Most people would probably tell 
me that I'm being over sensitive; that 
while the occasional feeling may be 
hurt by sexual insults, no pennanent 
damage is done. I beg to differ. 

I'm convinced that women and 
men rarefy talk about the repercus-
sions of sexual insults because it's 
embarrassing to do so. They fear 
the social stigma of being labeled a 
wimp, soft and sensitive, girly, gay 
or a bitch. Yet, just because people 
don't talk about a problem doesn't 
mean that it doesn't exist. 

I'm a pretty vocal, confident 
person and, in most cases, I am not 
afraid to say something when I'm 
offended. But, when I'm the target 
of sexual insults, I just freeze. I 
don't say anything, instead I just 

~el ashamed, as if my behavior 
somehow justified the remark. 

The fact is that sexual insults 
leave those they target powerless, 
they are the equivalent of a punch 

in the stomach, and all you want to 
do is curl up into a ball and cry. Yet, 
that would be unacceptable. 

Instead, you have to suck it up. 
Well, I'm tired of sucking it up. I'm 
tired of acting like it doesn't bother 
me when I am called uptight for 
not laughing at boys' bathroom 
humor. It does and after 22 years I 
fina lly realize that I am not respon-
sible for bringing it on. The only 
thing I am responsible for is per-
petuating it by not complaining 
vocally enough in the past. 

I wish someone could have told 
me that I didn't have to take sexual 
insults when I was younger. Like 
other boys and girls, I spent a lot of 
junior high school miserable 
because I couldn't avoid sexual 
taunts. Junior high, which is effec-
tively a holding pen for honn"onally 
driven youth, was my personal hell. 

I spent my entire sixth grade 
aVOiding school because I was tired 
of being tormented - two boys 
had taken it upon themselves to 
make my life a living hell. 

At first, they would just yell 
insults at me. The favorite was 
"Julia, you're flat as a board and 
easy to screw: In retrospect, I real-
ize these boys probably had 
absolutely no idea what this insult 
meant. But, that didn't matter to 
me. I would cower every time one 
of those jerks came near me. 

Nevertheless, the fact was that I 
'"managed to handle the constant 
teaSing, even when it later escalated. 

About halfway through the 
school year, as if to prove their 
point, my two tormenters began 

Most people would 
probably tell me that I'm 
being over-sensitive; that 
while the occasional 
feeling may be hurt by 
sexual insults, no 
permanent damage is 
done, I beg to differ. 
stabbing me with pencils and turn-
ing them into my back, in an 
attempt to demonstrate their insult. 
Sure, I was embarrassed and devel-
oped a passionate hatred toward my 
tormenters, but to tell you the truth 
I didn't realize that what they were 
doing was really all that wrong. 

None of the teachers who wit-
nessed me being teased ever said 
anything. In fact, when I asked to 
move seats in science class because 
one of the bullies was jabbing pen-
cils into my back, my teacher calm-
ly explained to me that "that's what 

junior high school boys do." 
Well, it shouldn't be what junior 

high school boys do. My teacher, 
Mrs. Scraeder, was condoning the 
boy's behavior by not punishing 
him. She was no different than the 
other junior high school boys and 
girls who stood by and just 
watched the bullies tease me both 
verbally and physically. 

When my friends did try to pro-
tect me, they were usually labeled 
with an insult of their own. My 
friend Amy, who had gone through 
puberty early, was nicknamed "the 
watermelon queen" after she tried 
to help me. My friend Matt was 
labeled a "fag" after he yelled at the 
two guys teasing me. 

As my experience demonstrates, 
the problem with sexual humor is 
that it is completely acceptable to do 
nothing if you witness it. In addition, 
complaining about a "joke" only 
opens you up to being insulted. As a 
result, there is an incentive to say 
nothing, or, even better, to join in on 
the fun to prove your coolness. 

Admittedly, sexual humor in 
college is often not as blatant or 
openly offensive as junior high 
school insults. Instead, people 
engage in more subtle sexual rib-
bing. However, that doesn't mean 
the insults are any less offensive. If 
anything, they are more offensive 
because, as opposed to in junior 
high school, people now under-
stand what they mean. When some-
one calls a guy "pussy-whipped" 
because he values his girlfriend's 
opinions or calls a woman a "dick 
te.ase" because she doesn't want to 

sleep with every man who expresses 
a sexual interest in her, this person 
is well-aware of the implications of 
their sexual insults. 

In addition, just like in junior 
high school, people are still reluctant 
to criticize sexual remarks. In col-
lege, it is still not cool to complain 
about sexual humor or to defend 
someone who is being insulted. 
More importantly, sexual insults are 
seen as innocent, yet impulsive. 

When someone who is subject-
ed to a sexual insult complains, the 
reaction is often like that of my sci-
ence teacher Mrs. Scraeder. "Oh, 
that's just boys being boys." Or, 
they might respond, "Well, he/she 
didn't think you'd be so sensitive. 
It's not that big of a deal." 

Well, it is that big of a deal to 
me. I don't like having people make 
any presumptions about my anato-
my or bedroom behavior. Plus, I 
don't think that I'm going out on a 
limb to say that many men and 
women feel the same way I do and 
are just afraid to say anything. 

As a result, I've come to the con-
clusion that people who make sexu-
al insults either: A) intend to hurt 
those the insult is aimed at, whether 
consciously or subconsciously; B) 
think the insult is actually funny; or 
q just don't think before they open 
their mouths. I really don't have very 
much to say to people who fall 
under category A, other than that 
perhaps you should seek psycholog-
ical help. But, for those who fall 
under categories B or C, I urge you

mohomine: 
Gumpany success tied to 
good idea, great timing 
ContInued "0lIl ..... 4 
dents founded a new, incorporated 
company, mohomine, with 
Sourcebank as its tlagship, and 
essentially scrapped Revolution9. 

Being a limited liability compa-
ny, Revolution9 was unable to 
move forward as Samat and his 
cohorts had hoped it would. 

"When you get your company 
funded, the capital structure needs 
to be such that you can issue stock 
and move forward and do more 
funding later and make sure that 
things are set up right. Being naive 
about when we set up 
Revolution9, we made it an LLC, a 
limited liability company. It's much 
easier to issue srock and do other 
things like that when you're incor-
porated." 

The four friends realized that 
reorgani7.ation was necessary to get 
funding, develop and grow. 

With the birth of mohomine, 
the company named Neil Senturia, 
a prominent San Diego techn,.,logy 
entrepreneur, chairman of the 
board and chief executive officer. 

" eil helped organize the initial 
funding and is also, of course, our 
CEO: Samat said. "Neil ran a com-
pany called ATCOM, which he 

recently sold for all kinds of money. 
He ran a software company before, 
and this seems natural for him. 
Neil is in his 50s. He's adult super-
vision, [ guess." 

Samat anributes the company's 
success to timing and the open 
source movement. 

"The idea is simple: Don't re-
invent the wheel: he said.

never got why that kind of thing

UCSD is really known for biotech 
and biotech startups. For us, this is 
hopefully semi-demonstrative that 
UCSD can play in the same

Review 

Monday, April 10, 2000 

According ro Samat, students 
must focus on the practicality of 
their studies. 

"UCSD is a very theoretical 
institution: he said. "[t's very pred-
icated, at least on the engineering 
side, and [ think that it's easy to 
lose focus of the practical aspects 
of what you're [earning. For me it 
was very discouraging to essential-
ly see other schools with the same 
type of program, their students get-
ting out there, gening the support 
of the administration, getting the 
support of the department and 
gomg out and doing things like 
this, and not having that kind of 
momentum at UCSD." 

Samat truly believes that 
mohomine's success could happen 
to anyone, even in your own back-
yard. . 

"This has been a real.ride for us, 
but [ don't think that, by any 
means, we're the S/l1artest people 
with the best ideas at UCSD. There 
are tons of other people, and [ Just 
hope that they know that you can 
actually do this. [ know that if they 
were at Stanford or Berkeley, they 
would feel like they could. Being 
one step removed from all that, 
maybe we need a little bit of 3 
jump-start. [f [mohomine does) 
well, we can help show that you 
can really get out there and do 
that."

you'll come up with new and 
effective financial schemes. Write 
them down. Payoff debts on

Sunday, you could win a prize or 
find a bonus. Keep, it. 

UIInI (Sept. 23-Oct. 23) 
Are you worried or angry 

about something? Talk to a legal 
adviser on Monday or Tuesday 
and learn about your rights. By 

Monday, April 10,2000 

Wednesday you should be cooled 
down, so do something fun with 
your friends. On Friday and 
Saturday you may be in the mood 
to clean out your closets. Do it 
because then you'll have a good 
excuse to pamper yourself on 
Sunday. 

....,.. (Oct. 24-Nov. 21) 
A lot of work needs to be done 

this week, so pace yourself. 
Monday and Tuesday shouldn't 
be bad. Your intuition's good, but 
don't $et drifty. The boss could be 
watching you on Wednesday. You 
could get a raise if you're good at 
what you're doing. By Thursday 
the heat should be off, and on 
Friday you may have extra time to 
run and play with your friends. 
That theme carries on through 
Sunday. 

......... (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) 
Expect fun and games this 

week, with the possible exception 
of Monday and Tuesday. Figure 
out whether or not you're paying 
too much; you might be. 
Wednesday and Thursday are lots 
of fun, but travel doesn't look 
good. Do something romantic 
close to home instead of going 
out. Be prepared for an inspection 
on Friday and maybe one on 
Saturday, too. Relax with the fam-
ily on Sunday. 

c.,.tcorII (Dec . 22-Jan. 19) 
Monday and Tuesday could be 

busy. Change things around at 
home and don't put up with any-
thing you don't like. You 'll find 
the money if you look hard 
enough on Wednesday and 
Thursday. Travel on Friday and 
Saturday and consult an older 
person on Sunday. You could get 
some good advice. 

AqurI •• (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) 
You're studying this week if 

you're wise, which you are. You 
may be doing something the hard 
way at work, however, on Monday 
and Tuesday. You hate it when that 
happens. You may gct a boost from 
a partner on Wednesday or 
Thursday. By Friday you should 
have a better routine. You may find 
another source of income on 
Saturday, so use the funds to travel 
on Sunday. 

PI_ (Feb. 19-March 20) 
This week you're concerned 

about money - and maybe 
romance, too. Can't afford a gift on 
Monday or Tuesday? No problem. 
On Wednesday and Thursday you 
may find extra work that will bring 
in the cash you need . Look for it, 
of course. Spend time with your 
mate on Friday and Saturday and 
buy presents for each other on 
Sunday.

Rape of Mexican Teen-ager Stirs Abortion Outcry 

MEXICALI, Mexico - More 
than a year ahead of time. Paulina 
Ramirez Jacinta planned on a long 
organdy dress, live dance band and 
skyscraper cake for her 15th birth-
day party, the pinnacle event for a 
teen-age girl in Mexico . 

Those plans ended on the 
night of last July 31, when a 
drunken housebreaker ransacked 
her family's simple home and 
then, almost as an afterthought, 
decided that he would rape her. 

As soon as her famity received 
the news that she was pregnant, 
mother and daughter felt certain 
about what to do. 

"I thought it just wasn't possi-
ble for my daughter to have a child 
by a man whose name we didn't 
even know; the mother, Maria 

Elena jacinta, 45, said as she twist-
ed a handkerchief anxiously in her 
hands, with Paulina sitting close 
by her side. 

Paulina is in her ninth month of 
pregnancy. Though they wanted an 
abortion, which is legal for rape vic-
tims in this state on the border with 
California, her family abandoned 
the idea after weeks of confronta-
tions with senior state officials. who 
believe that abortion is a taking of 
life. She plans to have the baby by 
Caesarean section on April 14. 

No official ever refused Paulina 
the abortion, but they counseled 
her against it so openly and force-
fully that she and her family 
became frightened and desisted. 

The case has become a cause 
among feminist gro~ps and some 

prominent intellectuals in Mexico, 
where abortion is outlawed with 
few exceptions. shunned by the 
medical establishment and con-
demned by the Catholic Church. It 
is normally practiced in an under-
ground where as many as half a 
million women terminate pregnan-
cies clandestinely each year. 

The office of the human rights 
prosecutor, an independent agency, 
tn her home state of Baja Californ18 
ruled in March that Paulina's rights 
had been violated by the govern-
ment's failure to carry out the abor-
tion. and he called on the state to 
set up a long-term fund to care for 
her and her child. 

State officials have offered to 
assist Paulina only if she will give 
the baby up for adoption. which 

her family is reluctant to do. 
On April 6, several dozen 

Mexican intellectuals, including 
the novelists Carlos Fuentes and 
Laura Esquivel, signed an open 
letter in Mexico City newspapers 
calling on the state to accept the 
human rights prosecutor's recom-
mendation to indemnify Paulina. 

Paulina still envisions a grand 
bash when she turns 15 in 
September, but her mother said 
that "it wouldn't look right" for 
her daughter to celebrate while 
nursing an infant. 

"I just want my party, even with 
a short dress; Paulina said, and 
for the first time in retelling her 
ordeal, she began to cry.

Two Koreas Agree to First Meeting at Summit Level 
SEOUL, South Korea - In a 

major di~loinatic effort to heal 
one of the Cold War's last con-
flicts, the South Korean govern-
ment announced Monday that 
North Korea had agreed to a June 
summit between the two coun-
trirs. 

Officials said the meeting, 
which would be the first between 
heads of state of the two countries, 
would involve discussions of a 
wide range of issues separating the 
two Koreas. which have been left 
divided since the 19505. At a news 
conference here Monday. officials 
said the issues to be discussed at 
the summit June 12-14 in 
Pyongyang. the Nonh Korean 
capital, would include economic 
cooperation, reunification of sepa-
rated families and political recon-

ciliation. 
"It appears that North Korea 

decided that there could be no

There was no immediate con-
firmation from North Korea, but 

officials here said that Pyongyang 
was expected to issue a statement

about in the glacial state of mutu-
al nonrecognition between the

Yugoslavia: 
Serb leader brought before 
court for genocide 
ContI ...... from ..... 1 
at the Bosnian town f Srebrenica, 
probably Europe's worst massacre of 
civilians since World War II. 

On Friday, prosecutors brought 
before the court a top Bosnian Serb 
political leader who is charged with 
complicity in the genocide that the 
prosecutors say his people perpe-
trated against Bosnia's Muslims 
and Croats, but who not so long 
ago was accepted as a figure who 
could meet with Western presi-
dents and prime ministers. 

While problems remain, and the 
recent momentum is the result of 
slow shifts by Western govern-
ments and tribunal prosecutors 
themselves, the changes have 
engendered a rare sense of excite-
ment in the sober high-security 
building on the outskirts of this 
Dutch city where judges are quiet-
ly testing and defining uncharted 
international laws. 

"The momentum and the energy 
at the tribunal have been amazing; 
said Heather Ryan of the Coalition 
for International Justice, which has 
monitored proceedings on behalf of 
several human rights groups for 
almost two years. "I've not seen so 
much substance at anyone time, at 
least in the public arena. The tribunal 
seems to have hit a new stride." 

Several factors have contributed 
to the tribunal 's new momentum. 

Western governments, wh ich 
long appeared to pay only lip ser-
vice to the court, lauding Its objec-
tives but starving it of funds and 
intelligence, now find it more polit-
ically convenient to have their sol-
diers arrest imponant suspects, 
such as camp commanders and 
Bosnian Serb and Croat generals.

Consider the smoking case now 
unfolding in Miami as Exhibit A in 
the increasingly strange looking-
glass world of tobacco litigation. 

Last week, the six-member jury 
in the class-action lawsuit awarded 
$12.7 million to three people cho-
sen to represent hundreds of thou-
sands of Florida residents who 
smoked. The same panel will next 
decide whether to award damages 
to punish tobacco producers for 
their conduct, a sum that because 
of the size of the class could reach 
into the tens of billions. 

Whatever the case's outcome, 
however, it has already produced 
some unexpected twis~ State law-
makers who recently vilified ciga-
rette makers as profiteers hawking 
a deadly product are now pressing 
to protect industry profits so they 
can continue to receive lawsuit set-
tlement payments worth $246 bil-

lion to the states. 
Cigarette makers, who decried 

the state lawsuits as little more 
than legal shakedowns, have also 
changed their tune. Now, in argu-
ments to jurors like those in the 
Miami case, they point to settle-
ment concessions as evidence that 
they have agreed to change their 
practices and so don't need to be 
further punished. 

Steve Sugarman, a law professor 
at the University of California at 
Berkeley, said these strange turn-
abouts were not coincidental. When 
the first state lawsuits to recover 
smoking-related health care costs 
were filed in 1994, the tobacco 
industry was considered not only 
legally impregnable but also finan-
cially ripe for legal plucking. 

A few years and $26 billion 
later, Sugarman said, that may no 
longer be the case. "Suddenly, 

instead of there being a goose with 
an unlimited number of golden 
eggs, people are thinking there may 
be only so many eggs; he said. 

As a result, those with a hold on 
the honey pot are defending it against 
newcomers like the lawyers pressing 
the Miami case. Neither individual 
lawsuits nor class-action c;Ises like 
the one in Florida were settled by the 
resolution of the state actions. 

Cigarette companies say they 
still believe that a higher Florida 
court will eventually dismiss the 
case. Bob Rabin, a law professor at 
New York Universi~y, said that 
because punitive damages would 
be awarded in the case before pro-
ducers could get such a ruling, 
they might choose to settle it, given 
what is at stake if they failed to 
have it thrown out.

Reno Signals Showdown in Fate of Elicin 
WASHINGTON - Attorney 

General Janet Reno said Sunday 
that she was determined to reunite 
Elian Gonzalez with his father this 
week, signaling a likely showdown 
in the international c~tody battle 
over the 6-year-old Cuban boy. 

"Each day that goes by only 
hurts him. and I think we must get 
it resolved as soon as possible.~ 
Reno said on the ABC News pro-

Sm "This Week; referring to the who was rescued from the At antic Ocean off Florida last 
Than~givin$' 

In Miami, Elian's great uncle, 
Lazaro Gonzalez, who has tempo-
rary custody of the boy, had sent a 
letter to Reno asking her to tenta-
tively schedule a meeting on 
Monday in Miami with a psychiatric 
panel, although he complained that 
the three-member team did not 
plan to meet with Elian. 

Reno had asked for the meeting 

with the doctors to discuss how to 
transfer the child with minimum 
trauma: but it remained uncertain 
whether the meeting would occur 
because Gonzalez said that he 
wanted his daughter, who is in the 
hospital, to attend. 

In two television interviews 
Sunday, Rem~ would not discuss 

s~cifiC5 of how· immigration offi-
ctals planned to take custody of 
the boy. Justice Depanment offi-
cials are wary of any use of force. 
Reno said that she wanted to 
arrange a transfer that was not dis-
ruptive. 

Hundreds of supporters have 
gathered outside the Gonzalez home 
in Miami in a peaceful vigil that the 
authorities believe could turn violent 
if the relatives resisted the govern-
ment's order to tum over the boy. 

That order, shifting custody of 
Elian from his great uncle to his 
father, will likely be issued on 

Monday afternoon or Tuesday and 
would probably set a deadline of 
later in the week, government offi-
cials said. 

Lawyers for the relatives have 
repeatedly said they would obey 
the law, but have been unwilling to 
negotiate the terms under which 
they will relinquish custody. 

Government officials have 
accused the relatives' lawyers of 
stalling in the face of lawful direc-
tives granting custody to Elian's 
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. 
Lawyers for the relatives have said 
the government has not allowed 
the appeals courts time to consider 
Elian's legal rights. 

The court is not considering 
whether Elian should remain in 
the United States but whether his 
Miami relatives may file a political 
asylum claim on his behalf.

Researchers Map Out Human Genome 
Breakthrough is first major step toward understanding genetic blueprint 
Iy TODD MIUOURNI 
Minnesota Daily 

(U-WlRE) MINNEAPOLIS -
Private researchers announced 
Thursday they have sequenced 
the genome of a single human 
being, a major step toward under-
standing the human genetic blue-
print. 

Celera Genomics Group, a 
biotechnology firm in Rockville, 
Md., has been working to uncov-
er D A pieces since September 
1999 and will now begin the cru-
cial step of fitting them together in 
their proper genetic order using 
high-powered computers. 

"This IS big-time," said Richard 
King, a University genetics profes-
sor, of Celera's advancement. 
"They now have the ingredients; 
they need to bake the cake." 

" ow that we have completed 
the sequencing of one human 
being's genome, we will turn our 
computational power to the task 
of ordering the human genome: 
sa id j. Craig Venter, Celera's 
president and chief scientific 
officer, in a statement about the 
next step in the mapping 
process. 

A final draft of the human 
genome is still not expected for 
severa I years. 

The human genome is a bio-
logical blueprint of the 3 billion 
pairs of chemicals inside human 
D A. It maps how those pairs are 
arranged to construct the genes 
that serve as instruction manuals 
fo r life functions. 

Researchers can study genetic 
va riations in different people to 
locate where eye color, height and 
genetic diseases are genetically 
located. 

Scientists said they hope to 

MOSSY 
CHEVROLET 

pinpoint specific genetic diseases 
and develop effective treatments 
by understanding the human 
genome. 

"This is expected to allow 
researchers worldwide and our 
subscribers to utilize our data to 
make important medical 
advances: Venter said in the 
statement. 

A complete human genome is 
like having a periodic table for 
genetic disease, King said. Despite 
the potential benefits the human 
genome might offer, many are 
concerned about the ethical Issues 
raised with the availability of 
genetic information and Cdera's 
practice of charging a subscription 
fee for access to their database 
~rch tools. 

"This information can be mis-
used: said Jeffrey Kahn, director 
of the University'S Center for 
Bioethics. "It can be used to dis-
criminate in employment and 
insurance." 

There are no federal laws on 
the books protecting citizens from 
genetic discrimination. 

President Bill Clinton, howev-
er, signed an executive order in 
February outlawing the use of 
genetic information by the federal 
government. 

"Genetic information has the 
potential for discrimination 
because it can predict what's 
ahead: King said. 

However, trying to gauge 
future health would not be a 
departure from the traditional 
business practice of conducting 
physicals. King added. 

Concerns have also been raised 
about who will be able to afford 
the presumably expensive genetic 
treatments. ' 

"It may divide between the 

haves and have nots: Kahn said. 
"People who can afford therapy 
will get it and many might not 
have access." 

A federally fu nded effort to 
map the entire genetic code, The 
Human Genome Project, has 
been researching DNA since 
1990. The nonprofit organization, 
unlike Celera, publishes each 
gene it decodes on the Internet. 
So far, 2.3 billion subunits of 
DNA have been posted, all of 
which is available for free public 
use. 

Celera and the Human 
Genome Project use different 
methods to decode and map 
DNA. 

Celera uses what it calls a 
"shotgun technique: the same 
technique the company used to 
successfully map the genome of a 
fruit fly earlier this year. Using the 
method, researchers quickly iden-
tify fragments of DNA and then 
try to fit the pieces together. 

Much of the genetic informa-
tion Celera uses in his research 
comes from the data made avail-
able by the Human Genome 
Project. 

In contrast, the technique used 
by the H!Jman Genome Project 
identifies DNA fragments and 
orders them as they are discov-
ered. 

The Human Genome Project 
expects to finish and make avail-
able the complete code by 2003. 

On the New York Stock 
Exchange on Thursday, shares 
of PE Corporation, the parent 
company of Celera, soared 21 
percent. Shares opened at $113 
and reached $143 by the closing 
bell. 

The company started the week 
at $90 per share. 

L.E.A.P.: 
Park says amount of hate 
crimes are under counted 
C ........ "..,...l 
new multiracial complexities that do 
not fit into existing political 
processes and structures. The even-
tua� goal of the transformation is to 
create "new urban race relations· to 
move racial politics away from 
white-black dynamics and toward 
the more complex dynamics of 
"post-Civil Rights" politics. 

Park went on to address the issue 
of hate crimes, citing specific inci-
dents such as the beating death of 
Vincent Chin as just one of miny. 
He said there is a severe undercount 
of hate crimes because of the reluc-
tance of Asian Pacific Islanders, par-
ticularly immigrants, to report them. 

Racial classifications and the 
2000 census were the focus of 
Espiritu's segment. She recounted 
how Asian Pacific Islanders' census 
categories help create group identi-
ties and influence public policy. 
According to L.E.A.P., "Asian 
Pacific Islanders have been an 
object for racial classification for 
over a century, with categories 
changing to accommodate the 
racism of each decade." 

Espiritu urged Asian Pacific 
Islanders to fill out their census 
fonns and to be "more anentive to 
the publication and use of the data 
collected on Asian Pacific Islanders. 

"In pursuing these actions, the 
focus extends beyond the process 
of simply adding up and demon-
strating the 'numbers' to make 
claims, but to deal with the com-
plex social issues that lurk behind 
them: Espiritu added. 

The question and answer por-
tion of the roundtable discussion 
was the final segment. In it, a vari-
ety of issues were brought up and 
discussed. Saito included a person-
al account of one of the evening's 

Monday, April 10, 2000 

prevailing themes, that of the Asian 
as a • perpetual foreigner· or 
"indelible alien." 

He noted how unlike many 
other minority groups, Asian 
Pacific Islanders have had to deal 
with issues of loyalty. 

L.E.A.P. recognizes the difficul-
ty of moving beyond a black-white 
discourse. Many argue that the 
focus should remain on African 
Americans because of the legacy of 
slavery and how it has shaped the 
nation's history. However, many 
others have argued the growing 
need to expand the race-relations 
framework to include the perspec-
tives of the two fastest growing 
populations: Asians and Latinos. 

A "politics of possibility" in pro-
moting social change was one of 
the final themes of the evening. 
According to L.E.A.P., Asian 
Pacific Islanders must playa larger 
role in generating new po~sibilities 
for race relations. 

Founded in 1982 by a cross-
section of Asian Pacific American 
leaders, the Los Angeles-based 
organization plays an active role in 
developing and expanding the 
leadership roles performed by 
Asian Pacifi Americans in all sec-
tors of American society. Through 
leadership, empowerment and pol-
icy, Its mission is to attain full par-
ticipation and equality for Asian 
Pacific Americans. 

According to L.E.A.P., the goals 
of its mission are to develop Asian 
Pacific American leadership in the 
private, public and community sec-
tors; to develop the skills and 
resources of Asian Pacific 
American communities to increase 
both individual and organizational 
effectiveness; to increase public 
understanding of Asian Pacific 
American concerns and their 
impact on policy formulation and 
decision-making at local, regional 
and national levels; and to improve 
cross-cultural and inter-ethnic col-
laboration and interaction.

12 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, April 10, 2000 

BuildingABetterMachine 

ThePresidelit 

ScottMantell 
Scott Mantell has the well-

defin ed goals, experience and drive 
necessary to make a great A.S. pres-
ident. Mantell, the current A.S. 
commissioner of programming, 
wants to improve the quality of life 
of UCSD students, increase politi-
cal awareness on campus and 
expand and improve A.S. servic ... s. 

Mantell's best ideas revolve 
around improving student quality 
of life. He plans to work toward 
increasing student organization 
funding. keeping the library open 
24 hours during final s week, 
extending dining hall operations 
and fighting for more student park-
ing. 

Given last year's student fee 
increase, it makes no sense that 
student organizations are still 
receiving significantly less funds 
than they request. Mantell has out-

lined specific areas in which he 
feels money is being spent irre-
sponsibly, and plans to reprioritize 
the budget so that student organi-
zations are able to receive the funds 
they so desperately need. 

One area from which Mantell 
believes funds can be drawn is the 
A.S. executive expenses - the 
money executive officers use for 
lobbying activities, such as taking 
people out to lunch. We commend 
Mantell on his willingness to cut a 
fund that, although somewhat friv-
olous, would benefit him personal-
ly if elected president. 

Mantell's ideas don't end there. 
He also has a comprehensive plan 
for increasing political action and 
awareness on campus. Mantell is 
dedicated to registering every stu-
dent on campus to vote in the 
November presidential election. 
Most impressively, he has a detailed 
plan for achieving this objective. 
He plans to coordinate a voter-reg-
istration drive with student organi-
zations that plan to carry out simi-
lar campaigns, such as the Student 
Affirmative Action Coalition, fra-
ternities and sororities, and college 
councils. 

In addition to voter registration, 
Mantell also plans to increase 
political action on campus by orga-
nizing the Quint Council - an 
organization of the five college 
chairs - into a more effective, effi-
cient representative body. 

Mantell has a number of ideas 
for improving A.S. services and 
outreach, including creatin~ an all-
college commuter board, Improv-

, ing A.S. Lecture Notes and 

expanding the niton Taxi program. 
Commuters are a long-neglected 
group of students. As Mantell 
points out, campus commuters 
need more power to lobby the uni-
versity on important issues such as 
parking and reduced off-campus 
housing fees. Mantell also recog-
nizes that many commuters are 
~ransfe~ students and that by 
lIuprovmg commuter student qual-
ity of life, transfer student quality of 
life will also increase. 

When it comes to A.S. Lecture 

Notes, Mantell admits that the ser-
vice is not open to a great deal of 
nonscience classes. He also admits 
that while Thton Taxi is a great 
idea, it has not been well-executed 
so far. Wait times for taxis are 
ridiculously long, discouraging 
students from using the service. If 
elected, Mantell would increase 
funding for this valuable organiza-
tion, hopefully making it more 
accessible for students. 

In addition to having great 
goals, Mantell also has the most 
experience out of the five presiden-
tial candidates. He is the active 
commissioner of programmins and 
also has a great deal of expenence 
at the college level. 

Mantell is currently a Marshall 
resident advisor, and has held a 
number of positions inside the 
Marshall College Council. 
Mantell 's combination of college 
and A.S. Council experience makes 
him ideally suited for the office of 
A.S. president. 

Perhaps Mantell's most shining 
quality is his dedication to being an 
advocate for UCSD's diverse stu-
dent body. Unlike 'SOme of the other 
presidential candidates, Mantell's 
motivation for running for presi-
dent is pure - he wants to help 
students, not boost his resume. 
Mantell has proven that he is will -

in~ to work incredibly hard to serve 
thiS function. If elected, he plans on 
spending his summer working for 
the students, something that has 
been rarely done by newly elected 
A.S. presidents in past years. 

In summary, the Guardwn is 
confident that Mantell would make 

a fantastic A.S. president. He has 
the drive, determination, experi-
ence and goals necessary to per-
form the job extremely well. The 
GlUJrdian urges students to vote for 
Mantell for president. 

DocKhaleghi 
Doc Khaleghi has a wealth of 

experience in the A.S. Council, 
having served as A.S. commission-
er of academic affairs, A.S. parking 
committee chair and executive 
assistant to current A.S. President 
Tesh Khullar. His most recent 
accomplishment was helping cre-
ate parking "flex-passes" - parking 
permits for Monday-Wednesday-
Friday and Tuesday-Thursday-
Friday. 

Although Khaleghi has experi-
ence, his post-election plans are not 
as developed as those of Mantell. In 
addition, many of his goals are not 
original, but instead are continua-
tions of current A.S. projects. 

Khaleghi would like to improve 
diversity on campus, increase the 
availability of off-campus housing 
through a tax-incentive program 
and expand his "nex-pass H parking 
program. If elected, Khalegh i 
would also work toward boosting 
funding for club teams so they can 
compete on the national level and 
establishing a permanent Triton 
Tide to support student athletes. 

He is also dedicated to preserv-
ing all-campus commencement 
and finding a quality speaker far in

advance. In addition, Khaleghi 
would like the A.S. Council to 
make low-risk investments with 
some of its reserve funds. 

Khaleghi has some quality ideas 
and a great deal of experience. He is 
without a doubt the second-best pres-
idential candidate, behind Mantell. 

AliYazdi 
Ali Yazdi has a number of good 

ideas, and in many previous elec-
tion years he would have been the 
best candidate. However, due to his 
lack of A.S. e~rience, Yazdi falls 
short of being an ideal choice for 
A.S. president this year. 

Yazdi would like to improve 
programming; athletic support, 
A.S. marketing and awareness of 
A.S. services. He would like to 
improve programming by spending 
more money on larger events and 
less on small ones. Yazdi would also 
like to have more cultural pro-
gramming. and garner corporate 
sponsorships for Sun God and 
other large programming events. 

Yazdi is also passionate about 
improving athletic support on 
campus and has a very detailed, 
feasible program for starting Team 
Thton, a permanent athletic boost-
er organization. In addition, Yazdi 
has criticized the A.S. Council Web 

page for being poorly maintained 
and poorly designed. 

Like other candidates, Yazdi also 
said that A.S. Lecture Notes should 
serve a wider variety of classes and 
that library hours should be extend-
ed. If elected, he also would also push 
for all classes to be accessible online. 

In summary, Yazdi has a num-
ber of quality ideas, but is lacking 
the A.S. experience to assure their 
implementation. 

TariqParwani 
Tariq Parwani is running a very 

different type of campaign. He has 
decided against having any flyers, 
pamphlets or public appc;arances 
besides the A.S. presidential debate. 
Parwani sees himself as a stro,,&-
headed candidate, albeit without 
leadership experience, that will be 
able to achieve long-awaited 
improvements for students. 

Parwani has a number of good 
ideas, including increasing admin-
istrative accountability, boosting 
school unity and making the A.S. 
president more visible. He vows to 
increase administrative account-
ability if elected by fighting impor-
tant issues through to the end. 

Parwani wants to increase 
school unity by standardizing gen-
eral education requirements across 
the five colleges. In addition, if 
eleCted, he would make the A.S. 
Council and A.S. president more 
visible by putting comment boxes 
around campus, improving the A.S. 
Web site and increasing the num-
ber of public appearances for the

A.S. president. 

Parwani has some novel ideas. 
However, given his lack of leadership 
experience and campaigning. he is 
neither the most qualified nor most 
likely to win the A.S. presidency. 

DerrickYee 
Derrick Yee is wildly unqualified 

for the office of A.S. president. In 
addition to his complete lack of 
leadership experience, he has 
shown an amazing lack of aware-
ness when it comes to campus 
issues and A.S. Council operations. 

If elected, Yee would like to make 
the A.S. Council more responsive. 
eliminate sales tax on university books, 
keep the library open until 2 a.m. and 
improve the quality of food in the Price 
Center. Yee's plan to eliminate sales 
taxes on university books, although a 
nice idea, simply cannot be accom-
plished in a one-year presidential term. 
In addition, he has absolutely no idea 
how to achieve this objective. 

Although Yee had some interest-
ing ideas, he lacks even ba~ ic knowl-
edge of campus events. In addition to 
his other goals, Yee is campaigning 
on the promise of moving the uni-
versity to Division n athletics, despite 
the fact that the university has 
already approved a move to Division 
II, which will take effect next year. 

Yee also plans on sening up an 
A.S. Council Web site, and sending 
out a weekly A.S. presidential 
report via e-mail. Perhaps he 
should have consulted some other 
students before making these cam-
paign promises, as they would have 
surely told him that these idea5 
were implemented years ago. 

In summary, Yee does not 
belong on the same election ballot 
as the other presidential candi-
dates. The Guardian strongly 
believes that his election would 
spell disaster for UCSD.

The VicePresidents 

JeffDodge 
VP Internal 

The office of vice president 
internal is responsible for chairing 
A.S. Council meetings, as well as 
in ternal committee meetings. The 
internal committee meets once a 
week and makes formal rec,m-

mendations to the A.S. Council 
regarding legislation under its 
jurisdiction. In addition, the vice 
president internal is responsible for 
personnel issues within the A.S. 
Council and for reaching out to 
students. 

This year, the Guardian feels Jeff 
Dodge is the most qualified candi-
date for this office. As a Marshall 
sophomore senator, Dodge was 
elected senate chair at the begin-
ning of his term and h3'S served 
that office effectively, initiating a 
senate newsletter and chairing sen-
lite meetings. He currently serves 
on the chancellor's budget com-
mittee and is the advisor to the 
Preuss School's student govern-
ment. He has also served on the 
UCSD Academic Senate as an 
undergraduate advisor. 

As vice president internal, 
Dodge wants to increase funding 
to student organizations and give 
priority to certain groups, such as 
the Student Affirmative Action 
Coalition . Dodge also hopes to 
expand student outreach programs 

... Dodge wants to

such as O.A.S.I.S. and the A.S. 
Outreach Program to help promote 
diversity. 

In addition, Dodge aspires to 
improve the A.S. Council's public 
relations. He wants the council to 
give back to the students it serves 
by continuing to offer and expand 
services. for the student body, such 

as providing free schedules of 
classes and blue book.s. Dodge said 
he would also work to expand and 
improve the Triton Taxi program as 
well as Increase the number of 
classes covered by A.S. Lecture 
notes. 

In addition, we feel Dodge has 
the experience necessary to ,run 
A.S. Council meetings effectively. 
Besides chairing senate meetings, 
he has also run A.S. Council meet-
ings in place of Jennifer Lee, the 
current vice president internal. We 
believe Dodge has proven his abili-
ty to run meetings in an unbiased 
manner in proper accordance with 
parliamentary procedure. 

Unfortunately, the Guardian was 
unable to interview lracy Le, the 
other candidate for this office. Le is 
currently the Muir freshman sena-
tor. 

The Guardian was dully 
impressed with Dodge's qualifica-
tions and commitment to filling the 
position of vice president internal. 
We are pleased to offer our 
endorsement for his election.

BuildingABetterMachine 

The VicePresidents 

EugeneLD.Mahmoud 
VP External 

The vice president external is 
one of the most prominent mem-
bers of the A.S. CouncIl. Because 
he or she 'serves as a liaison 
between UCSD and the San 
Diego community, other universi-
ties, statewide and nationwide stu-
dent organizations and .even gov-
ernment officials, the vice presi-
dent external must be k.nowledge-
able, committed and well-con-
nected. 

While the Guardian believes all 
three students running for vice 
president external are strong can-
didates, we endorse Eugene L.D. 
Mahmoud. Mahmoud's experi-
ence, passion and dedication to 
outreach far surpasses that of Ian 
J. Stewart and Justin Grooms. 

A member of the Independent 
slate, Mahmoud's risum~ boasts 
involvement with both the UCSD 
community and more broadly 
based organizations. 

He has represented the 
Student Affirmative Action 
Coalition for Thurgood Marshall 

College Council and has served 
as the statewide external affairs 
director. Furthermore, Mahmoud 
was a facilitator of the University 
of California Student 
Association's Students of Color ' 
Conference, and has represented 
UCSD at several other student 
conferences. He is also involved 
with the San Diego Youth 
Coalition. 

Guided by an interest in stu-
dent empowerment, Mahmoud 
listed a handful of concrete goals; 
his primary focus is on increas-
ing the representation and reten-
tion of underrepresented stu-
dents. He proclaimed a dedica-
tion to lowering student ft:es and 
aims to work with student orga-
nizations to increase voter regis-
tration as well. 

In add ition, Mahmoud is 
committed to working toward 
affordable on- and off-campus 
housing fo r UCSD students. He 
proposes that the university 
embrace alternatives such as co-
op housing structures and sup-
ports tax incentives for off-cam-
pus landlords. While some work 
has been accomplished in the 
area of tax incentives, Mahmoud 
said he will take the next steps in 
the fight for affordable student 
housing. 

.Mahmoud has a firm approach 
to the issue of funding for UCSA 
- a UC organization with which 
he will serve as a liaison if elected. 
He believes UCSD should refuse 
to fund the association if it does 
not adequately represent the uni-
versity'S interests. 

Mahmoud is pro-Affirmative 
Action, and also supports the 
repeal of SP-l and SP-2. 

Opponent Stewart has served 
as the vice president of his frater-
nity, vice president of UCSD's 
Inter Fraternity Council and has 

Guided by an interest in 
student empowerment, 
Mahmoud listed a 
handful of concrete 
goals; his primary focus 
is on increasing the 
representation and 
retention of under-
represented students. 
participated in philanthropies. 

Stewart sees Affirmative 
Action as a short-term solution, 
and wants to increase student 
diversity through recruitment 
techniques such as campus tours 

and dinners. In addition , he 
wants to lower off-campus hous-
ing costs, but did not specify how 
he would achieve this. 

Stewart plans to use his term 
as vice president external to 
increase UCSD's voice in UCSA's 
affairs and increase the A.S. pres-
ident's accountability. While 
these are valid ambitions, they 
are nonetheless too general and 
lack th e concrete planning and 
experience beh ind Mahmoud 's 
goals. 

Wh ile Grooms' on-campus 
involvement has been minimal, 
he is a fo rmer employee of Kia 
Serra's out reach division , fo r 
wh ich he helped implement 
Affirmative Action programs. He 
ai ms to increase diversity at 
UCSD by el iminating financial 
barriers. 

Grooms has a bundle of fresh 
ideas, including the decriminal-
ization ·of responsible marijuana 
use by adults and the extension 
of Triton Plus to off-campus ven-
dors. He also feels that UCSA 
funding should be increased if 
the organization adequately rep-
resents UCSD's interests, but 
that funding for the United 
States Student Association - a 
national version of UCSA -
should be decreased . 

Although Grooms offers a new 
outlook on key issues, without 
student government or student 
organization experience, he lacks 
the necessary familiarity with the 
UCSD campus to effectively serve 
on A.S. Council as vice president 
external. 

In summary, although Stewart 
and Grooms are qualified candi-
dates, the Guardian endorses 
Mahmoud for vice · president 
external because he has the wis-
dom, experience and passion to 
bring this office to life.

Matthew Powell is t h~ more quali-
fied candidate for A.5. vicc presI-
dent of fi nance. 

Powell ran fo r this position last

ues his experiences on both sides 
of the financial table, both as a dis-
tributor of funds and as requester. 

Powell credits Rovner with set-
ting an exrellent precedent and 
said he has learned a lot from 
working with the current vice pres-

mind, should be placed on tcach-

Fee Referendum Question 
1 asks UCSD students to pay 
75 cents per quarter to the

Association as part of the Stu-

which will only be in place for

Patterson, A.S. vice president

responsibility for campus media organizations. 

Powell also wants to make traver allocations 
more fair and accessible to all organizations 
even after the third week of the quarter, a com-
plication that currently [!lagues student organi-
zations seeking A.S. support for travel expenses. 

Powell said of all the organizations that 
receive funding from the Student Organization 
Funding Advisory Board, he feels the cultural 
organizations promoting diversity and club 
sports promoting school unity are the most 
important. 

He also believes in cooperation between tht 
financial office and the A.S. president when 
making financial decisions. 

The A.S. Council has been considering the 
issue of investing its mandate reserves into 
mutual funds in order to increase returns at a 
low risk. Powell feels this is a wise idea as long 
as only a limited amount of the reserves, one-
half or one-third, for example, is invested. 

Clearly, Powell is cautious with student fees 
but not afraid to try new ideas. With his expe-
rience as the current financial controller and 
his ideas, he is the ideal candidate for vice pres-
ident finance. 

Powell's opposition, Sam Shooshtary, is a 
good candidate, but having just transferred to 
UCSD from Grossmont College, he is not yet 
fully familiar with the workings of UCSD. He 
gained his background in business through 
running his family'S business for four years. 
Shooshtary was also the financial comptroller 
at Grossmont Community College; this ~i­
tion is the equivalent of UCSD's vice presIdent 
finance. 

Active in the Hate-Free Campus campai~, 
Shooshtary also believes in increasin$ fundmg 
for cultural organizations and holdmg more 
conferences to promote diversity. He does not 
believe in the current viability of investing 
mandate reserves in mutual funds but does see 
it as a possibility for the future. 

Overall, Shooshtary is an amicable candi-
date, but is not the best person for this job. 
Powell has been primed for the job and is 
lady to jump into action.

18 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, April 10, 2000 

BuildingABetterMachine 

TheCommissioners 

LanaKreidie 
Academic Affairs 

The fact that no one chose to 
challenge Lana Kreidie for the 
position of commissioner of acad-
emic affairs is te timony to the 
extent to which prospective can-
didates have been impressed by 
her motivation, dedication and 
experience. Anyone running 
against her would be competing 
against a great proven leader who 
is eager to take on this new 
responsibility. 

The commissioner of academ-
ic affairs is responsible for dis-
cussing academic issues and 
keeping good communications 
between the students and the fac-
ulty by attending numerous meet-
ings and serving on many com-
mittees. 

This Independent slate candi-
date has proven she is willing to 
accept these responsibilities by 
attending countless meetings and 
serving on many committees. 

Kreidie is the junior senator 
for Eleanor Roosevelt College and 
also the chair of the executive 
committee for transfer students. 
With these positions come many 
hours of hard work that Kreidie 
has demonstrated she is willingly 
capable of fulfilling. 

Kreidie has proven her desire 
~o help represent the students of 
UCSD by serving as a student 
representative on the academic 
senate and as a college peer advi-
sor. As Kreidie explained, her pas-
sion and motivation run deep. 

While in office, Kreidie plans 
to change three important aspects 
of this school : representation, 
support and education. Her prior-
ity IS to ensure that there is an 
Increase in the student voice on 
campus. Admirably, Kreidie wish-
es to make sure all student com-
plaints are heard in order to pro-
mote a better teaching and learn-
ing environment. 

One of the ways she intends to 
accomplish this is by educating 
students on school policies so 
they understand their rights as 
students. The GlUlrdian feels that 
this new knowledge will be an 
effective tool to create a more suc-
cessful academic life for all stu-
dents. 

Lastly, Kreidie has chosen to 
endorse and support such. pro-
grams as O.A.S.l.S. and the 

o 
Academic Success Program to 
further help students in need of 
academic advising. In the past, 
these programs have served as 
valuable resources to students in 
need of extra assistance. 

The Gl/IJrdian supports Kreidie 
in her mission to promote the 
academic lives of students and 
endorses her bid to become the 
new commissioner of academic 
affairs. 

NoConfidence 
Communications 

The duties of A.S. commis-
sioner of communications 
include the allocation of funds 
to various mainstream and alter-
native campus media grQups 
such as the Koala, the Voz 
Fronleriza and Temper; the pro-
motion of these groups to stu-
dents interested in participating 
in them; and the general over-
Sight of the performance of these 
groups. 

Independent candidate Rami 
Shaarawy is running unopposed 
for this office, and despite his pre-
vious experience with the A.s. 
Council and Warren College 
Council, the GlUlrdion feels 
Shaarawy lacks even the most 
basic knowledge necessary to 

make responsible decisions as 
A.S. commissioner of communi-
cations. 

Shaarawy lacks concrete 
plans and goals to pursue while 
in office. He says he will allocate 
funds based on ·performance 
and circulation" of media 
groups, which is unfair to small-
er publications such as 
HealthBeat - whi h, regardles~ 
of its smaller size and circulation 
compared to publications such 
as the Koala, shou Id be afforded 
equal consideration in terms of 
funding. 

Shaarawy also says that he 
wants to make campus publica-
tions more visible by acquiring 
more magazine racks to place 
around campus. However, he has 
not explained where he will get 
the money for this expenditure. 

The Guardian feels it would be 
bener to have no commiSSIOner 
of communications at all than 
one who docs not even know the 
names of all the student publica-
tions on campus (i.e. Voz 
Fronteriza). Shaarawy represents 
a serious weakness in the 
Independent slate, and the 
Guardian finds it unfortunate 
that, barring the lowest voter 
turnout in UCSD history, he will 
be elected simply because he is 
running unopposed. 

With only one vote needed to 
elect .10 unopposed candidate, 
the Guardian urges students, 
including Shaarawy, to not vote 
for the commissioner of com-
munications.

TheCommissioners 

CassieWiliiams 
Programming 

Most candidates for commis-
sioner of programming will argue 
that it is one of the most impor-
tant position~ on the A.S. 
Council. The commissioner of 
programming is in charge of 
booking bands for Fallfest, 
Winterfest and Sun God, as well 
as the "nooners· held on 
Wednesdays in Price Center Plaza . 

The Guardian feels Cassie 
Williams is the most qualified can-
didate for this position. As the cur-
rent assistant programmer, 
Williams has gained plenty of expe-
rience and is well-aware of how the 
office works. S he is fully prepared 
for the time commitment and 
grunt work involved in running the 
office, We feel she has the energy, 

ideas and experience to run the 
office effectively. 

If elected, Williams said her first 
priority would be to begin booking 
acts for Fallfest and Winteriest By 
booking bands ahead of time, the 
A.S. Council could get more band for 
its buck, since travel fees for the 
bands are often higher when they are 
booked at the last minute, she said. 

In another effort to save money, 
Williams said she would work with 
other UC campuses to coordinate 
programming events and create a 
"UC Tour" for bands. Booking sev-
eral shows in one geographical area 
is another way to save money on 
travel expenses for bands. Since 
programming already uses a large 
majority of the A.S Council's bud-
get, we feel that Williams' commit-
ment to saving time and money i's 
extremely important. 

She also supports the minimal 
use of corporate sponsorships for 
UCSD events as a way of saving 
money, although she acknowl-
edged that almost half of UCSD 
students are opposed to the use of 
corporate sponsorships. 

In addition to the quarterly fes-
tivals, Williams expressed a com-
mitment to smaller events such as 
nooners, noting that No Doubt 
once played at a UCSD nooner 
before they became famous. 
Williams said she hopes to have 
more.up-and-coming bands play at 
UCSD. She also said she will make 
the search for a good commence-
ment speaker a priority. 

Williams is extremely passion-
ate about her work and the office 

In addition to the 
quarterry festivals, 
Williams expressed a 
commitment to smaller 
events such as nooners, 
noting that No Doubt 
once played at a UCSD 
noaner before they 
became famous. 
for which she is running. She 
understands the importance of 
programming, especially on a cam-
pus without high-profile sports 
teams. 

. We feel that Williams' oppo-
nents, although qualified, would 
not do as good a Job as Williams. 
Vicky Bender has experience in the 
programming office and connec-
tions in the music industry. Grace 
Fairchild said that if she were elect-
ed, she would work to extend Sun 
God to a week long event, would 
recruit more diverse speakrrs and 
would try to get more popular 
bands to come to campus. 

The Guardian feels that Bender 
and Fairchild fall short of being the 
most qualified candidates. While 
some of their ideas are good, their 
experience is limited when com-
pared to Williams'. either Bender 
nor Fairchild show the enthusiasm 
and well-prepared goals of 
Williams. We therefore enthusiasti-
cally endorse Williams for commis-
sioner of programming. 

MatthewConroy 
Services and ~terprises 

Although both candidates 
are enthusiastic about fulfilling 
the position of commissioner of 
services and enterprises, 
Matthew Conroy is the more 
qualified and connected candi-
date. 

Having helped start the new 
Triton Taxi program, he is look-
ing to expand the service so the 
wait time is decreased and has 
many ideas for the future. He has 
been the race director for the 
cycling team and a member of 
the Co-op oversight committee. 
This experience gives him an 
edge in his qualifications for this 
position, as overseeing the Co-
ops' financial well-being is one 
of the main responsibilities of 

the commissioner of services and 
enterprises. 

In addition to expanding the 
Triton Taxi program, Conroy 
wants A.S. Lecture Notes to 
cover more classes. He believes 
that by raising the price of lecture 
notes by just $2 (from $16 to 
$18), he can provide lecture 
notes for many more classes and 
raise the salary of note-takers for 
A.S. Lecture Notes. 

He also wants to ensure that 
students living on campus can 
rent microfridges even during 
the middle of the year, rather 
than just at the beginning of fall 
quarter. 

Conroy has talked to and 
formed connections with many of 
the organizations that he would 
be working with in this post, 
including A.S. Lecture Notes and 
the General Store. He promises to 
keep track of the important issues 
affecting students and deal with 
them fairly. 

The other candidate for ser-
vices and enterprises, Anu 
Shome, shows great potential as 
a leader in the future. However, 
he doesn't currently have the 
same level of experience, and 
preparation, that Conroy does. 
Seeing as how he is still a fresh-
man, he would do well to help 
with thiS office's duties in order 
to become a viable candidate for 
next year. 

The Guardian therefore 
endorses Conroy for the position 
of commissioner of services and 
enterprises.

endorses Johan Hill for the A.S.

Hill's experience on the 
Marshall College Council, and as 
Marshall junior senator, com-
bined with his experience working 
in the Student Advocacy Office, 
makes him a solid candidate for 
the job. 

If elected, Hill intends to pursue 
several goals, which include getting 
all students registered to vote for 
the November election, and ensur-
ing that students are aware of their 
rights through workshops and easy 
access to a students' rights hand-
book. Hill also plans to open a dia-
logue with Student Health in order 
to address the quality of service

Hill also proposes coordinating 

with the external office in order to 
face broader issues that affect the 
student body. In addition, his par-
ticipation with The Hate-Free 
Campus Campaign and his mem-
bership in Workgroup on Quality 
of Student Life for 
Underrepresented Goals testifies to 
his interest in students' rights and 
interests. 

The other candidate for com-
missioner of student advocacy, 
Amy Kuo is also a very competent 
candidate for the job. She has expe-
rience as an intern for the San 
Diego City Attorney's Office 
Criminal Division. as well as with 
attorney Robert Schlein. However, 
despite an impressive resume and 
articulate presentation, the 
Guardian feels that Kuo's lack of 
actual on-campus student advoca-
cy experience, compared to Hill's 
strong background places her 
behind Hill in terms of qualifica-
tions for this office.

22 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, April 10, 2000 

BuildingABetterMachine 

Votin Online 
As with UCSD's fall referendum 

election, students can vote in the 
upcoming A.S. Council elections 
from any computer with Internet 
access via Studentlink (http://stu-
denllink.ucsd.edu) . The schedule for 
online voting coincides with the 
voting schedule for the physical 
voting booths - from Monday, 
April 10 until the polls close on 
Thursday, April 13 at 4 p.m. 

Unlike the traditional voting 
booths, however, students can vote 
online 24 hours a day until the 
polls close on Thursday. 

Plus, given the convenience of 
online voting, students can vote 
naked if they like ... unless they 
intend to vote from one of the 
campus computer labs, in which 
case they could at least throw on 
some boxers. 

If students are unaware of the 
fact that online voting was imple-
mented for the fall referendum on 
whether or not to expand the Price 
Center (or that an election even 
took place, for that matter), they 
shouldn't worry - they're not 
alone. 

UCSD's last referendum vote 
failed to pass because only 12.6 
percent of UCSD's population 
turned out to vote, even with the 
addition of online voting - well 
short of the 20 percent quorum 
required for the vote to be official. 

Despite this unspectacular debut 
for Studentlink voting. its second 
appearance promises to be more 
lucrative. A.S. elections should draw 
more voters than the rather uninter-

esting Student Centers referendum, 
merely because of the greater 
import of the election's results for 
the student body. It may actually be 
a blessing that Studentlink's shake-
down cruise proved to be so 
uneventful - now that more 
important matters are at hand, it is 
reassuring to know that the system 
has been proven to be reliable. 

There are some lingering con-
cerns about the nature of online 
voting and its potential for election 
fraud, but as long as the system 
administrators keep on their toes 
and exercise caution in how they 
implement the system, the online 
part of the election should run 
smoothiy. 

There have been no major 
instances of hackers meddling with 
Studentlink tei date, which should 
mean that the election process will 
be relatively secure on this system 
as well. 

Fear of abuse is no reason to shy 
away from new technologies 
entirely; there may be a few bumps 
along the way, but that's all just 
pan of the growing process. 

This new technology allows 
UCSDstudents to vote literally in a 
matter of minutes. Now the only 
hard pan for student voters is tak-
ing the time to educate themselves 
about the issues beforehand. 

To vote online, follow these 
steps: 1) log onto studentlinlt.ucsd.tdu 
2) go into AS Elections 3) follow step 
by step instructions 4) vote for can-
didate of your choICe both campus

Overly Complicated 
Law'. Tax American. 
An abundance of deductions, exemptions and 
credits make the tax code burdensome and unfair 
IJIIVII .. 
Staff Writer 

What is so challenging and 
complex that many people put off 
doing it until the very last manute it 
is due? No, not studying for final 
exams or writing term papers. [ am 
talking about filling out income tax 
forms. 

Every year in April, millions of 
Americans must endure the ardu-

tax system is so compleX that even 
tax pros often miss things. [n the 
March 1997 issue of Money 
Ma~ all 45 tax experts incor-
rectly prepared a tax return when 
they were asked to prepare tax 
returns for a fictitious family. [n the 
study, less than !me-fourth of the 
subjects came within S 1,000 of the 
correct total and the final tax bills 
ranged from $36,322 to $94,438. 
Unfortunately, the tax system has-

ous task of com-
pleting their feder-
al income tax 
returns. Many 
spend long hours 
filling out their 
1040 income tax 
form as well as any 
other paperwork 
that may apply to 
them. Others end 
up spending 
money out of their 
own pockets to 
have a professional 
tax accountant 
complete their tax 
mums for them. 

CUrTentry, the tax 
code exceeds 7 million 
words. Compare that 
to "War and Peace," 
which has 660,000 
words, or the Holy 
Bible with 774, 746 
words. 

n't gonen any eas-
ier.since then. 

Deductions , 
exemptions and 
credits also make 
the tax system 
unfair. Taxpayers 
with the same 
incomes end up 
paying vastly dif-
ferent amounts of 
taxes to the [RS. 
Most loopholes 
only benefit par-

What makes 
the federal 
income tax system 
so complex is the 
proliferation of 
deductions, cred-
its and exemp-
tions written into 
the tax code. Over 
the past few 
decades, ConF 
and the president 
have maintained a 
policy of targeting 
specific programs 
and groups 
instead of cutting 

The IRS estimates 
that it takes the 
average person 6 
hours, 22 minutes 
just to fill out a 

ticular groups that 
they target, and 
those who miss 
the tax breaks they 
should have quali-
fied for end up 
paying higher 
taxes than they 
need to. 

1040 ... Most 
taxpayers also must 
complete other tax 
forms that may take 
anything from 30 
minutes to over two 
hours to complete. 

What is more 
disturbing is that 
a rich person can 
take advantage of 
the tax benefits 
and consequently 
pay a much small-
er proportion of 
his income than a 
middle-class or 
poor person 

taxes across the board. People get 
tax breaks on their income tax 
based on the way they spend their 
money. As a result, we have an 
unfair federal tax system that 
wastes everybody's time, money 
and energy, If all of these tax shel-
ters and loopholes were eliminat-
ed, the federal income tax system 
would be simrler, less stressful 
and fairer to al . 

Cumntly, the tax code exceeds 
7 million words. Compare that to 
"War and Peace," which has 
660,000 words. or the Holy Bible 
with 774,746 words. 

The IRS estimates that it takes 
the average person 6 hours. 22 
minutes just to fill out a 1040, A 
huge portion of the 1040 tax form 
reftrs to credits, deductions and 
exemptions. Most taxpayers also 
must complete other tax forms that 
may take anywhere from 30 min-
utes to over two hours to complete. 

Many deductions, exemptions 
and credits have their own sepa-
rate form to fi ll out. People may 
even have to fill out the calcula-
tions on those forms just to fil)d 
out if they even qualify for that 
panicular benefit. 

Throw in the record Itceping. 
the time spent learning about the 
complicated tax laws and the 
forms, then the copying. assem-
bling and mailing. and you could 
spend several days working on 
your taxes. ! 

Many people do not have the 
time to fu[1y research all their 
records, learn about the entire tax 
code and fiU out all the requisite 
paperwork. Taxpayers end up over-
looking many of the deductions, 
exemptions and credits they could 
possibly qualify for. Many do not 
have the resources to figure out 
which amlS to plan, spend and 
invest their income in the future so 
that they could qualify for more tax 
breaks next year. 

would. The 
wealthy could spend time studying 
the tax code instead of working 
long hours just for a decent pay-
check. A rich person has the 
money to hire tax experts and 
accountants to find and exploit tax 
benefits. The federal income tax is 
suppose to be a progressive tax 
system where the rich have higher 
tax rates than the poor, After all· 
the loopholes, a poor or middle-
class person could end up paying 
an equal or greater percentage of 
his income than a rich person 
would. 

What we need to do is to cut 
all of the deductions, credits, 
exemptions, loopholes and shel-
ters out of the federal income tax 
system. The complexity of the tax 
system would be dramatically 
reduced and it would be fairer to 
many Americans. We should also 
cut taxes so that the system 
would be revenue-neutral and 
generate about the same amount 
of money as before. [ am not 
advocating a flat tax per se. We 
can keep the progressive system 
while simply lowering all of the 
tax rates in the different tax 
brackets across the board to rea-
sonab�e levels. 

Of course, this proposal will not 
happen anytime in the near future. 
Like the flat tax, the national sales 
tax and other reforms, most po[iti-
cians arc afraid to radically change 
the income tax system. They would 
call down the wrath of the many 
groups who benefit from the cur-
rent system. People who currently 
enjoy tax breaks would complain to 
their congressmen. H&R Block 
and other tax CPA firms would be 
forced out of business. 

So if this year was your first 
time filling out your own tax 
return, get used to the complexity, 
the long hours and the procrasti-
nation. For those who haven't

Liberal Arts Majors Get 
Lost in a Sea of Sciences 
UCSD's notorious emplursis on scientific fields 
often leaves other students feeling lost and alone 

Male Chauvinism Permeates Society 
Dear Fcminazi: 
[ just finished reading Jessica 

Schcppmann's anide ("A harm-
less evening between friends soon 
turns into a vicious battle of the 
sexes,· The Editor's Soapbox, 
April 3). I would just like to let her 
know that she is the luckiest girl 
in the world if this is the worst 
experience of sexual harass-
ment/assault she has ever had . I 
don't know how sensitive she is, 
but if she was able to take her 
nickname as a joke, she is a 
stronger woman than I. If I were 
in her situation I would be frus-
trated, to say the least. In an 
attempt to shed a little light on 
the subject for those male mem-
bers of our campus that don't 
seem to get it and possibly 
improve the quality of daily life of 
all the female members, her fellow 
staff members voided her article 
of its meaning. They turned it into 
a joke rather than acknowledging 
its truth and supporting their col-
laKue. 

female. In other words, they will 
never know what it is like to live 
in fear every single day of thei r 
lives. 

I cannot speak for every other 
woman out there when I say tha t. 
Many women have been so well 
trained in the role of "normal 
American female" that they might 
even think that I'm being dramat-
ic. Whether or not anyone on this 
campus or anyone a nywhere 
would like to admit it, sexism -
or whatever you want to call the 
social custom that has men as 
predators with women as their 
prey - is a reality, not a tool 
women use to get attent ion 
(Thank you, Monica Lewinsky) . 
That brings up an important 
question: Why do women feel 
they have to go to such extremes 
to get attention? 

IJ DlVYA N. lUMeNAL 
Columnist 

Before I begin my tirade 
against the scientific and med-
ical community here at UCSD, I 
would like to apologize to those 
of you who understand math 
and science. It's not that I don't 
like you, but I have issues with 
the heavy emphasis on science 
on this campus. I would also like 
to add that my mathematical 
knowledge is basically limited to 
multiplication and everything 
before it, and that my scientific 
knowledge has only enabled me 
to understand that the earth is 
populated by living things. 

Having said that. I will con-
tinue my argument against the 
prevalence of science and fur-
ther strens.then my defense of all 
the poor liberal arts majors who, 
like me •. have been disillusioned 
with this school's emphasis on 
neurons, skeletal structures and 
microb!ology.

Tennis Suffers Three Losses in Rough Weekend 
The men's team is defeated by Sonoma State, USIU and Trinity University and amasses two tough injuries in the process 
By BIU BURGER 
Sports Editor 

The last week and a half have not gone 
well for the UCSD men's tennis team. On 
April 2 the team got shelled 7-0 at the hands 
of No. 1-ranked UC Santa Cruz. Later that 
week the Tritons received news that their o. 
2 singles player, Corey Moderhak, had been 
declared academically ineligible for the rest 
of the season. This was the backdrop for last 
weekend's three matches with Trinity 
University, Sonoma State and United States 
International University. 

The bad string continued for the Tritons 
as they lost 1-6 to TIinity and 0-7 to Sonoma 
State before losing 3-4 to USIU in a match 
that they certainly could have won. 

"We need to have someon'e step up,· 
Head Coach Eric Steidlmayer said. "We can 
still hang in there without Corey [ModerhakJ 
but we need to playas a team." 

Against Trinity University the TIitons 
came up just short in doubles before getting 
trounced in singles. 

At No. 1 doubles. Michael Meyer and 
Dan Albrecht fought as hard as they could. 
but their opponents. who are ranked in the 
top five in the country in Division !II. were 
too tough and sent the duo to an 8-5 loss. 

"Sometimes you go out there and you 
just don't have it." Steidl mayer said. "Those 
guys were really tough. and we just didn't 
have enough to keep up." 

Sean agle and Mike Rosen played at 
o. 2 doubles and won 8-6 against a team 

who were doubles All-Americans last season. 
The match was Nagle's first of the season. 

Joe Diehl and Ryan Thompson lost 8-5 at 
o. 3 doubles. This loss ensured that TIinity 

would win the doubles point. 
In singles. the loss of Moderhak really 

hurt the Tritons. who lost every match except 
for No.1 . 

At No. 1 Meyer fought through a hand 
injury that would hinder him all weekend to 
defeat Sloan Rush from Trinity 2-6. 7-5. 6-2. 
Meyer had match points against him in the 
second set at 3-5 but fought back to take the 
set and the match. 

"I just tried to keep balls in play." Meyer 
said. "I was kind of pushing my backhand 
but that was all I could do because of my 
hand." 

Against Sonoma State the Tritons strug-
gled mightily. Meyer and Cedric Mazzara 
won 8-1 at o. 3 doubles but the Tritons lost 
every other match-up. 

At USIU, the Tritons got off to a good 
start and won the doubles point for the first 
time in almost two weeks. Unfortunately the 
doubles wins went for naught. as USIU won 
four of the six singles match-ups to take the 
match 4-3. The only wins in singles for the 
Tritons came off the racquets of Ryan 
Thompson and Scott Anderson . who played 
No.3 and No. 5 respectively. 

"We had chances to win [at USIUJ but 
we lost a few close matches: 5teidlmayer 
said. Steidlmayer refused to ~Iame injuries 
for his team's demise. but the match would 
certainly have turned out differently if 
Roset! and Meyer hadn't been out with 
injuries. 

The men's tennis team's record now 
stands at 9-7 and it is coming down the 

Usa Huff/Guardian 
" ......... Michael Mryer gets ready to hit a forehand in a match ear/ier this season. Mryer's 
strong play i:; one of the reasons that the Tritons still have a chance at nationals. 
home stretch. The men play Point Lorna 
Nazarene University next Friday before their 
big match-up with Claremont College on 
April 22nd. Both matches will be on the 
Muir Courts and both start at 2 p.m. 

"Claremont is o. 2 in the region. and I 
think if we beat them we assume that posi-
tion." Steidlmayer said. "Being No.2 would 
be big because we would gl:t a bye in the first 

round of regionals and only have to win one 
match to make it to nationals." 

Losing this match would be detramental 
to the TIitons' cause because it would ensure 
a match with UC Santa Cruz in the regional 
tournament. 

Get out and root on the Tritons on as they 
make a push for their first NCAA 
Tournament in recent memory.

Volleyball: 
Two victories this weekend 
will ensure the title 
CMlI .............. 12 

"They are a really good team." 
Head Coach Ron Larsen said. "They 
can legitimately win the NCMs this 
year. and they needed the win, so we 
saw their best players. " 

UCSD had a better time of it on 
the offensive end against USC, but 
had a difficult time restraining the 
Trojans lethal offensive attack. The 
Trojans. who came into the match 
ranked No.3 in Division I. were led 
by setter Donald Suxho who had 35 
sets and was a perfect eight for eight 
on attacks. In the end the TIojans 
were too tough for UCSD and 

our capabilities." 
The final regular seaSon game 

for the Tritons is this Thesday, 
when they take on rivals San Diego 
State. The women's volleyball team 
will be camping out in front of 
RlMAC Arena tonight to give the 
match more exposure. The atten-
dance at the SDSU match should 
challenge the all-time RlMAC 
attendance mark for a volleyball 
game. The game begins at 7 p.m., 
but be sure to get there early as 
seats may be hard to come by. 

The Division III Invitational 
Tournament will be held in 
Hoboken New jersey on Friday and 
Saturday and the Tritons have 
already wrapped up the No. 1 seed. 
They will play Stevens Technical 
Institute. a team that the Tritons 
crushed to open last year's regular 

came out on top 
15-3. 15-6. 15-0. 

"USC has three 
losses in conference 
and can't afford any 
more." Larsen said. 
"They came out 
fired up against us 
and played some 
great volleyball." 

Reeling from 
their two prior loss-
es, the Tritons trav-
eled to orthridge 
on Saturday to take 
on the Cal State 

"I expect the 
championship game 
tlJ be us and NYU. 

~ beat them in four 
games earlier this 
year but they are a 
realry good team and 

season, in the first 
round on Friday at 
7:30 p.m. If they 
win, they will play 
the winner of NYU 
and D'Youville 
College of Buffalo 
for the National 
Championship. The 
consolatiOn match 
will be held at Sp.m. 
on Saturday. 

"' expect the 
championship 
game to be us and

Matadors.

problems. That 
match could have 
gone either way. " 

YU." Larsen 
said. "We beat 
them in four 
games earlier this UCSD put up a 

much better fight in 
this match. but still 
lost 15-7. 15-9. 15-
3. After two bad 

_ ... ...... year. but they are a 
Men's Volleyball Head Coach real good team and 

can cause us some 

matches earlier in the week. Zack 
Hite had a much better performance 
against the Matadors. Hite recorded 
12 kills and only committed six hit-
ting errors. Chen led the Thtons in 
kills with 14. Earnest Yun was the 
Tritons most efficient hitter, record-
ing five kills and no hitting errors. 

"We had just been hammered 
twice and we may have been look-
ing ahead to the San Diego State 
match and the Division III tourna-
ment." Larsen said. "They played 
very well and we didn't play up to 

problems. That 
match could have gone either way" 

The Tritons were denied an invi-
tation to the tournament for the last 
two years in favor of La Verne 
University. in spite of splitting two 
matches with La Verne both years. 

As the No.1 team in the nation in

ene, 3-2. Jeff Meyers. the 
Kingsmen's third baseman. 
knocked a two-run dinger and 
sparked a four-run rally that put 
Cal Lutheran up 7-2. 

The Tritons mounted a mini 
comeback in the eighth inning as 
they scored two runs to draw 
within three with an inning to 
play. but it was too little too late. 
The Kingsmen added four more 
runs in the bottom half of the 
eighth. and shut the Tritons down 
the rest of the way, ending the 
game with a final score 11-4 

The TIiton pitchers, although 
they pitched well, walked seven 
batters. This combined with the 
five errors committed by the 
defense precipitated the loss. On 
the other hand. the Kingsmen 
pitchers. although allowing only 
one less walk. were able to work 
their way out of any jams that 
ensued as their defense stood 
strong behind them. committing 
only one error. 

The offense lacked its usual 
potency as Canale seemed to have 
most of the players' numbers all 
game long. 

The second game. however. 
was a slug fest as the Triton bats 
awoke with a vengeance. The 
Kingsmen were just as rapacious

and the field was soon littered 
with the corpses of RBis and hits. 

Cal Lutheran sprinted to an 
early lead as it jumped all over 
Triton starting pitcher Andrew 
Holloway. It scored four runs on 
five hits. in six at bats. Holloway. 
though turning in some good per-
formances of late, was on this day 
nothing but fodder for the can-
nons. 

After two-thirds of an inning. 
he was replaced by Erick Snyder. 
who in prompt fashion acted as 
the silencer. cutting through the 
booming bats of the Kingsmen to 
end their offensive output. at least 
for that inning. 

The Tritons scratched and 
clawed their way back into the 
game over the next two innings 
with a run in the second and two 
more off a Chad Addison bomb in 
the third. 

In the fourth. however. the 
Kingsmen caught onto Snyder's 
rhythm and tagged him for four 
runs. The Triton defense was 
once again at fault as an error in 
the inning led to an unearned 
run . 

With the score at 8-3 and the 
outlook grim. the Tritons sum-
moned everything in their arsenal 
and lit up the scoreboard. Tyler 
Sullivan hit his fifth homerun of 
the season and knocked in two 
runs. The Tritons scored two 
more and had a chance to take 
the lead when Harrison was 
replaced with David Gonzales. 
There were two outs and tensions 
were high. If the Tritons could

belong to them, but Gonzales 
retired the Triton batter and the 
inning ended 8-7. 

After failing to overcome the 
Cal Lutheran lead. it was up to the 
Tritons to hold the Kingsmen the 
rest of the game and play catch-
up. The Kingsmen offense. how-
ever. would not go quietly into 
that good night. After UC5D 
briefly tied the game in the top of 
the sixth. the Triton pitching sur-
rendered four more runs to post a 
final score of 12-8. Kingsmen. 

Gonzales was the winning 
pitcher and the loss was given to 
Darrin Macleod. The Triton 
defense was again suspect. com-
mitting three errors. 

Besides the offense, which was 
the main story of the game. a 
long-standing tradition of hit 
batsmen was revived on Sunday. 
Early in the game. Addison was 
plunked by a pitch. Then in the 
sixth inning. Nick Plancich was 
hit by Darrin Macleod. The 
umpire seemed to interpret this as 
retaliation and threw Macleod 
out of the game. 

O'Brien sprung to his pitcher's 
defense. and was subsequently 
thrown out of the game.

Red Sox as Series 
Champs? Please! 

With the major league baseball 
season one week old, I have been 
frantically watching games and 
looking through stats, attempting 
to decipher what the first few 
games of the long year mean. 

After all the observing I have 
done, I have come to one conclu-
sion: I have no idea what will hap-
pen this season. 

Let's start from the top -
Sports Illustrated's choice to win 
the World Series, the Boston Red 
Sox. So far the BoSox are 2-4 and 
have only won games when Pedro 
Martinez has pitched. Martinez 
may be able to win 25 games for 
Boston this year and he may even 
be able to dominate the postsea-
son like he did last year, but that 
isn 't enough to win all the way 
through the end of October. If 
the Red Sox are going to go all 
the way, they will need a stellar 
performance from Pedro and also 
an outstanding performance 
from one other pitcher, likely 
Pedro's brother Ramon. I don't 
see that happening, and once 
again the Red Sox will fade into 
the fall likr they have for the last 
SO years, wondering what went 
wrong. 

The Yankees have certainly 
been the default choice for World 
Series champs for the last four 
years. This year is no exception. 
No matter what SI says, the 
Yankees are still the team to beat 
in the American League. Their 
pitching is one year older and 
Cone and Clemens are nearing the 
end of their careers. I think that 
without a big mid-season trade, 
the Yankees are not going to hold 
up during the long season. They 
will lose in the American League 
Championship Series to the 
Cleveland Indians. 

With the emergence of Bartolo 
Colon as a legitimate No. 1 starter, 
the Indians have everything they 
need to go all the way. ot only 
will the Indians make it to the 
World Series, they will win it in six 
games over the New York Mets. 

The National League is down 
this season, and I am choosing the 
Mets basically by default. The 
Braves will not have John Smoltz 
this year, and Tom Glavine is start-
ing to show his age. Maddux is still 
one of the best and Kevin 
Millwood is starting to emerge as 
the ace of the staff, but that will 
not be enough to take the 
National League Championship 
Series this year. Not since the 
19S0s has the Braves' pitching 
staff been so vulnerable. 

The Dodgers will win the 
West, but that is only because 
somebody has to win this dread-
ful division. I have been a Dodger 
fan since the day I was born and 
would love see them go all the 
way, but it just isn't going hap-
pen. Shawn Green was a great 
acquisition, but the main reason I 
am picking the Dodgers is the 
fact that the Padres are dreadful, 
the Rockies are worse and the 
Giants don't have the pitching. 
The Diamondbacks all had career 
years last season and will not 
repeat it this year. Even though 
they have gotten off to a good 
start, ,they will eventually fade 
and come back to thr pack.

PORTS 
Runners Dominate at Home 
The women come in first and the men third in the UC San Diego Collegiate Invitational on Saturday 
By ICon BUIIIIOUGIIS 
Staff Writer 

The morning broke foggy and dismal over 
Triton Stadium as the athletes piled in by van or 
bus. ThIck and field squads from up and down 
the California coast were converging on the 
UCSD campus to face off in the UCSD 
Collegiate Invitational, As the runners greedily 
gulped down their vitamin drinks and ate their 
energy bars, they sized up the competition, 
which included teams from UC Santa Barbara, 
UC Irvine, UC Riverside, Point Loma Nazarene, 
Cal State San Marcos, Cal State Los Angeles, 
Cuyamaca College, United States International 
University and Cal Poly Pomona. 

Action on the infield began with the javelin, 
shot put, hammer and discus throws, UCSD's 
Catherine Nolan topped the class in the javelin, 
throwing an impressive 130'07" to outdistance 
the competition. Lynne Brinkman added a 
fourth-place hurl to pick up some additional 
points for the squad. 

The UCSD women also dominated the shot 
put, with Megan Steel schooling the other 
throwers with a mark of 40'04", In the discus 
toss, UCSD placed two women in the top eight, 
scoring with spots at 5th and 6th. The Tritons 
finished off with another victory in throwing 
competition, as Tina Summers overpowered 
the rest of the field with a throw of 155'02" to 
take first place in the hammer. These initial 
results, with the women winning three of the 
four throwing events, were an impressive start 
to the: meet and the Tritons showed no signs of 
letting up.

can accomplish more." The jumping events were next on the agen-
da and icole Johnson was ready for action, 
leaping to a fourth place finish . When they 
broke out the long pole, Kelly Wimnaugh and 
Rachael Campbell came up clutch for UCSD, 
clinching fifth and sixth place in the pole vault. 
Clara Wilson was the highest-scoring Triton 
long jumper at fifth, while Lilian Liu came in at 
third in the triple jump, 

In mec's running the Tritons picked up 
points in the 200 and 400 meters on the 
strength of David Newquist'S fifth- and fourth-
place scores. The SOO saw Steve Smith picking 
up points at third for the Tritons, while the 
1500 belonged to James Nielsen, who owned 
the competition with a first place time of 
3:56.64. 

The UCSD men's relay runners were bare-
ly edged by CSULA in the 4x100 to finish sec-
ond, Their time, however, was fast enough to 
set a UCSD school record and qualify for 
NCAA nationals. Steve Pease notched a sec-
ond-place finish for the Ttitons in the pole 
vault and Kwennon Kwok soared his way to a 
third place finish in the long jump competition, 
while nevor Takayama and Justin Chen added 
placing scores in the triple jump. 

On the men's side of the Collegiate 
Invitational, Matt Meskj.,men tallied points for 
the UCSD team in the shot put competition 
and the javelin hurl, with placings of seventh 
and fifth respectively. A Triton also managed to 
make it into the scoring slots in the discus toss, 
as Jim Freeman grunted his way to fifth place, 
In hammer-hucking action, Matt Deford and 
Eric Robin contributed scoring results with 

Nathan Garcia ran to a second place finish in 
the 5000 meter, while Jim Freeman crushed the 
other puny competitors in the 110-meter high 
hurdles, clocking in at 14.21 to take first place. In 
intermediate hurdle action, Rodger O'Keefe 
nabbed third place in the 400, while Armen 
Vartanian braved the infamous steeplechase 
course to gamer a sixth place score and pick up 
some valuable team points. Commenting on the 
action at this point, Vartanian said, ·We're out 

When the dust cleared and the final scores 
were tallied, the UCSD women's team emerged 
at the top of the heap, taking the first place title 
overall, besting second-place UCSB by nine 
team points. The men's squad's valiant effort 
procured them third place behind UCSB and

Volleyball Poised to Take 
National Championship 
Tritons will take on SDSU on Tuesday and then 
play in the NCAA Tournament this weekend 
ByIiLLBU .... 
Sports Editor 

With the regular season wind-
ing down, the men's volleyball 
team is beginning to focus on its 
Tuesday night match against San 
Diego State and its appearance in 
the NCAA Division III National 
Championship Tournament next 
weekend. 

The fact that their thoughts 
were elsewhere last week was evi-
dent as the Tritons were defeated 
by USC, Long Beach State and 
Cal State Northridge. 

Wednesday UCSD took on 
Long Beach State. Long Beach 
showed why they are the No. 2-

ranked team in Division I as they 
rolled over the Tritons 15-2, 15-5, 
15-S. UCSD was led by Donald 
Chen's 13 kills. Other than Chen, 
no Thton could get into an offen-
sive groove as the Thtons had a 
negative attacking percentage for 
the match. Matthew Holve and 
Zach Hite each had three kills and 
tied for second most on the team. 

UCSD couldn't stop Eli 
Fairfield for USc. fairfield had 14 
kills and six service aces while not 
committing any hitting errors. 

On Friday the Thtons headed \ 
to Los Angeles to take on the l 
USCThlWts.

Losses to Cal Lu 
Defense lets down the Tritons at crucial times 
and sends them to a pair of defeats 
., TAn IIILLIII 
Staff Writer 

The Tritons traveled . to 
Thousand Oaks last Saturday to 
match up with vau"ied Cal 
Lutheran an a double-header. The 
teams battled back and forth but 
when the final scores were tallied, 
the Kingsmen were on top 11 -4 
in the first game and 12-8 in the 
second, 

The first game got undctway 
at 11 a.m. on what was "an ugly 
dreary day,w according to Head 
Coach Dan O'Brien. 

The game pitted freshman 
Alexander Cremidan against Tom 
Canale of Cal Lutheran. 

Cremidan turned in an excellent 
. performance, which should be no 
surprise - ever since UCSD ace 
John Beaven went down widl a 
muscle strain a week ago, 
Cremidan has pitched with a 
newfound fervor, looking like an 
ace himself. 

Cremidan held the Kingsmen 
to just three runs in his five 
innings of work and only one of 
the runs was earned. The Thton 
defense was like Swiss cheese 
with holes all over the place. It 
committed five errors in all, 
allowing five unearned runs. 

Despite the errors. the game
