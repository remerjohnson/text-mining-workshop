U.s. Congress 
Investigates Prof 
ITHA A, N.Y. - David 
Levilsky, a professor of 
nutrition , is heing investigat-
ed for academic misconduct 
hy the U.S. Congress. 
Charges were hrought against 
him a couple o f years ago by 
Antonia Demas, a former 
student. University adminis-
trators found in Oct. 1996 
that Levitsky did not commit 
academic misconduct. Demas 
filed 23 accusations against 
Levitsky, including failing to 
give proper credit in a variety 
of instances, lying about the 
role she would play in a 
study and harassing her with 
call s and e-mails after Demas 
refused to work on the pro-
ject without pay. This investi -
gation is part of a nationwide 
investigation which is search-
ing for patterns of miscon-
duct in several universities. 
Levitsky sa id the investiga-
tion is "fooli sh and a waste 
of Congress' money."

Judicial Board Debates Future of Muir Senator Kleinbrodt 
TALK: A.S. committee 
will reach judgement 
within three days 
By Erika Snider 
Staff Writer 

The A.S. judicial board met yes-
terday to discuss whether to 
remove Muir Junior Senator David 
Kleinbrodl from hi s position after 
hi s February 19th expUlsion from 
the Muir College Counci l (MCC). 

Citing lack of attendance and 
failure to represent the Muir junior 
class , the MCC removed 
Kleinbrodt from his posilion as 
junior senator after he missed six 
l:Ounci l meetings this quarter. 

Kleinbrodt claimed that he was 
unable to go to the weekly meet-
ings because he had to attend an 
MCAT preparation class, which 

happened to co incide with the 
meeting . However, Kleinbrodt 
continued to attend the weekly A.S. 
meetings because he said that he 
was informed hy A.S. council 
members that he was obligated to 
attend A.S. meetings by a clause in 
the A.S. constitution . 

"I was shown a copy of th A.S. 
constitution, which said Ihat my 
first responsibility was to the A.S. 
council," Kleinbrodt said last night. 

Kleinhrodt also sa id that he 
notified the MCC of his inability to 
attend by asking Muir Senior 
Senator Chris Norri s to inform 
MCC Chair Erica Hannickel of the 
reason behind his absence. 
According to Kleinbrodt , Norris 
told him that he had notified 
Hannickel and that !>he would call 
him regarding the situation. 

Hannickel infonned the A.S. judi-

cia I board l a~t night that Norris told 
her "several times" that Kleinbrodt 
would contact her about his absences. 
Once Kleinbrodt failed to contact her, 
the MCC hcgan the process to recall 
the junior senator. 

"I was only informed of any 
. prohlems when I discovered that I 

was going to be removed Ifrom the 
MCq:' Kleinbrodt said last night. 

Normally, if a member of the 
MC misses more than two meet-
ings, he is notified of possible sanc-
tions against him with a letter from 
the ommissioner of Records, 
Sarah Sandstrom. Hannickel said 
that she, Sandstrom and Muir Dcan 
Chips Dreilingcr' chose not to send 
Kleinbrodt a letter because they 
wanted to meet with him personal-
ly, but that meeting did not occur. 

Hannickcl said he notified 
Kleinbrodt of the charges against 

him with an e-mail message, which 
also said thaI he would be allowed 
to defend himself before the coun-
cil. Kleinbrodt replied, slali ng that 
he would be unable to attend the 
meeting in which his recall would 
be discussed because he had to go 
to his MCAT class . 

The MCC voted to remove 
Kleinbrodt from ollil.:e and replaced 
him with Meredith Harrington, who 
eventually became Muir's new 
junior senator. Now the A.S. judicial 
board must decide whether to follow 
lhe MCC's decision and remove 
Kleinbrodt. 

"Senators are supposed to be 
representatives of their college 
class, both to the A.S. and to their 
college council," Hannickel said. 
"David Kleinbrodt, by not coming 
to meetings of the MCC, is not ful-
filling his position as such."

Pixon Method to Shed Light

SCIENCE: Technology 
may lead to advances in

By S, Javan Wygal 
Staff Writer 

A tea m of astrophysic i ~ t s ha~ 
developcd a tcchnique to disti ll 
information from astronomical 
imagery, bringing into view some 
of the farthest reac hcs o f our 
galaxy. In thc process. thcy may he 
pavi ng Ihe way for such advances 
as breaklhroughs in aniljcial intel-
ligentc and reducing the bandwidth 
bOllleneck on the Internet. 

The tcch niq ue, called the 
HPixon method ," mathemati cally 
cxtracts relcvant inform ation con-
tained w ith in any image data set -
whelher it be an exploding slar, a 
mcdi cal x- ray or a fami ly portrai l 
- while tossing away any " noise," 

or ex trancou. clcctronit mailer.

"The app l ications arc stagger-
ingly large," said Rick Puctwr, a

UCSD 's Center lor A, trophysics 
and Space . cic!l(;e ( .A .. S.) who 
concc i vcd the origina l procedure. 
" What we' re using is a brand new 
approach that ha, never heen 
looked at before." 

This approach is allowing scien-
tisls to view hodics thai have never 
been l: learly looked at before, such 
as the " Pistol" , tar, onc of the mosl 
massive Sial'S in our galaxy. el1lilli ng 
10 million times the power of our 
sun. The detai ls provided by thc usc 
of the Pixon method havc debunked 
Iheories that the Pisto l star mighl he 
a loose cluster of stars, and have 
helpcd to test theories about its for-
mation and life stages. 

" We' re finding things that arc a 
fac tor of 100 fainter than olhcr peo-
pic have found in various data se ts 
using lIny othcr method. We' re

Puetter sa id. "The uelail is greatl y

Everyone Must Work To

La~ 1 week, the U SD o rpOntle Focu~ Group mel 
al Lh c Facu lty lub 10 present ih repo n 10 a panel o f 
faculty me mbers and stude nt Icadl.!r~. The group 
identified Ihe s trength ~ and weaknesses o f UCS D and 
proposed ~ugges ti ons fo r improvement. 

The group, gathered by Vice Ch:.Illce llor of Student 
Affairs Joe W,llson, di scussed ways in which under-
graduale~ eould belle r prcpan.: to enle r the business 
world . 

The group concluded that students we re noL fully 
qualified to keep up wi lh the demands of indu st ry. 

Not only was the report a letdown, but the focus 
group ilself was al so a great disappointment. Rathe r 
Ihan activdy partaking in the process to pre pare stu-
denls for Ihe workplace, the group simpl y presented 

it ~ re po rt and le ft . 
U SD and the compani es invo lved need to fo ll ow 

throug h in improvi ng the an.:as in which the focus 
g roup found studcnts to bc lacking.

Women's Studies Should 
Choose Inclusive Name 

The women's studi es program is currently di s-
cussi ng substanti ve curricu lar changes, whi ch will 
most like ly result in a complementary name c hange 
to indicate that the program has been revised . 

The issue has rai sed some confu sion. provoki ng 
resp nses ranging from, " It 's about time; womell's 
studies shou ld be ma rc inclus ive," to "What 's a ll the 
hoopla? II 's fine as is," to " What's the dilTcre llce? 
They're j ust a bunch of bi ckering fcminazis." 

Almost every time the word " fe mini st" comes up 
o r someone says , ''(' m a wo men 's slUdies majo r," 
eyes roll , feet shuffle and , inva riabl y. impassi oned 
debate e nsues . Much of the reacti on IOward feminism 
is the e ffect of a mi sinformed publil: feed ing off 
med ia stereOlypes o f hra-hurning, man-haling hyster-
ical women . 

Any course in women 's studies will revea l that 
such is not the case. Wome n 's studi 's is a program 
geared IOward the slUdy a nd in ' Iusio ll of unheard 
voi ces that haw hi stori cally been marg inalized by 
more dominalll vo ices . 

For example. war has traditi onall y been told in terms 
of whi ' h ballies were fought on which soil by which 
ma le commanding offi cer. However, women's studies 
has n:vealed that history neglccts to tell the effects o f 
war upon women. a t until recent I did we know of 
" Rosie the Ri vete r" and the indi spensable role women 
played on Ihe domesti c front during both World Wars. 

Si nce the Civi l Ri ghts Era. however, women 's 
studi e~ has been progre~~ i vcl y expanding il s f us o f

COMMENTARY: Major gas corporations use underhanded strategies, suc h as zone pricing and selling at a 
loss, to cause independent stations to close, thereby forcing consumers to pay exorbitantly high prices 

CORPORATIONS UNDULY INCREASE GASOLINE PRICES 
By Dan Streeter 
Staff Writer 

San Di..:go mOlorists arc cur-

Allhough it is nicl: 10 he ahle to lOp

Why do Ihe prices ch<lnge so

from n..:ighhorhood III neighhor-

cost so much morc Ihan in Los 
Ange les? Who acluallY gCls thc

The answers 10 these queslions 
will disturh and angcr you if Y(lU 
arc oppo,ed 10 huge corporal ions 
taking advanlage of you and stea l-
ing yo ur lIloney. Whi le Ihe oil co r-
porali ons hide hehind Ihe mYlh of 
supply and dcmand. the slarlli ng 
truth is that corporal ions are in u 
posilion 10 conlrollhe gas prices in 
San Diego due to a lack of true 
co mpct i I ion. 

To hegin with. gas pri cc~ arc 
important 10 our economy. The 
economy of the Unilcd Slates is 
hased on the aUlOmohile. which i,. 
or course. fucled hy gaso li ne. Gas 
has hecome a hasic need for most 
Amcricans, just like food and ,hcl-
ler. The pricc of gas is a faclor in 
the coSI of li vi ng in any area and. in 
case you have nOI nOl iced. San

These assumptions ;uc part iall y

II must be under~LOod Ihal there

Why does gas In San

more than in Los

This i~ exacll y whal is going on in 
San Diego. 

The oi l compan ies claim that 

prices an: high in San Diego due 10

The facts refutc Ih~ ir ~ laims . Ci ties 
li"-e La, egas, which ha\ c highcr

from re lining fa~i l ilics . still have 
lower gas prices Ihan San Diego. 

The faci is. San Diego has very 
few indepcndenl gas stations com-
pareti lll a placc like Los Angcles. 
Thar is part of Ihe reason thai gas 
coslS more here than in Los 
Angelcs - Ihcrc is more Irue W Ill -

Diego.

Zone pri cing is anolher lVay in

Stcps are heing taken 10 remedy 
these problems. On reb. 4. of Ihi s 
year. the San Diego ity Coulll.:il 

pa~sed a reso lut ion calling for a 
policy of "divorcement" for gas 

stations. This means Iha! relining

1ft h i, pol icy becomcs law, oi I 

companies would nOI havc so much

mcans Ihal our gas prires \ ould no 
longer he so absurdly high in com-
parison to Ihe national average. 

Somc statcs, such as Ulah and 
Montana, have passcd laws Ihat 
makc it illega l 10 sell gas at a Inss . 
This policy protecls Ihe inlegrilY of 
Ihc markcI by defcnding Ihe imk-

Most people also 
have strong feelings

Religious Mfairs Hosts Discussion on Avoiding Cults 
FORUM: Chaplain 
Robert Wagner led 
lecture last week 
By Kathryne Lee 
Staff Writer 

Many cul t gro llP~ have found 
th~ir way onlO Ihe C D campu,. 
wher.: they .:agcrly so lici t 
~trangers th rough randolll C(IIWl:r-

~ati(Jn~ or wi th invitations to their 
churches. In light of this , the 
Office of Religious Affairs spon-

~ored a I\:cturc last Thursday to 
students on how to rel:ognize the 
tactics utilil.ed hy cults and high-
pressure religious groups to recruit 
new coll ege students. 

Robert Wagner, the chap lain 
for UCSD's campus ministries and 
a Lutheran pastor, led the di scus-
sion . Wagner said he li nds reli -
gious cults dcs trUl.: tive because 
"they dc-hu manize you by taki ng 
every thing you own." 

Accordi ng to materials pro-
duced by the Oflice of Religious 
Affairs , a cult is defined as a group 
organization usi ng high-pressure 
recrui ting lactics to att rac t new 
members , rat her than clearly 
detining the organi zati on's agenda 
and mission. 

Wagner said that many times 
when cu It members are asked 
what their goal, policy or belief is. 
they do not give a dear answer. 
Instead they tell the new recruits to 
have fa ith and that it wi ll later be 
revealed to them. Cults operate in 
a cloud of secrel:Y that Wag ner 
hel ieves can be misleading to 
naive stu dents who may not rea l-

il.e the colllillitment they ha ve 
, igned up for until it i, too late. 

Jen John son. a st udent at 
C D, said she has hecn 

approached hy l UIt recruiter, 
l11an) times during her four years 
here . 

"C lllt~ Illa"-e )OU Ii:c' l pr~yed 
UIX)!)" , he ~aid . "Lot~ of time,. they 
demean your religious afli liatil1ns 
and I I"celth<lt tn he olkn,ivc ,. 

On the CSD Ca tllpu, . there' 
arc nUIll(;rDUS rel igious and politi -
ca l gro ups a , tudent can join that 
Illay prove to he hendicial to the 
student 's futu re. 

The Onicc of Rdigiou~ Affairs 
warns student s agai nst sp 'li li c 
dubs that have been labeled as 
"cults" bel:ause they usua lly isolate 
their memocrs from family, friends, 
and students from other groups. 
Wagner said that whi le the Oflice of 
Religious Affai rs is unahlc to Jis-
close those organizations' names, 
they can be identilied th rough the 
tal:tics that he ou tlined. 

For example. Wagner said that 
cult members usua lly become so 
dependent on their w it for elllo-
tional stabil ity that the cult eventu-
ally takes over their life, their 
thoughts and their decisions; ren-
dering the individual completely 
helplessness without the cult. 

Christina Kaye, a Marshall 
senior, said she has seen the ellccts 
cults have on students lirsthand. 

"I had a fri end who got picked 
up by a cult her freshman year," 
she said. " It was scary to sec how 
Illuch control they took over her 
li fe . The cult leaders wo uldn ' t 
allow her to go home, and they 

tuld her what classes to take, and 
they controlled her money. But I 
don't think she eve r really knew 
what she signed up for when she 
did." 

In ,OIllC prel'iou, C,L~CS W<lgn 'r 
had worked on in the IXL~ t , studcnts 
rCCllunted w himl1(l\\ th\: lr cult had 

give into the demands of the cu lt , 
so metimes even fo rfe iting their 
co llege educations in order LO 
rec ru it new members. 

The pamphlet also states that 
cult s encouragc their rn 'Illhers to 
put cult mectings and activities 
hefore all other cOlllmitments , 

caw,ed thcm to 
drop out of ,chonl 
at the insistence of 
cu lt I.:"der~. Abo.

selves in financial 
difliculty after giv-
ing larg.: amounts 
of money to their 
cults. 

"For us, we get

- Janet Fink knew about that 
According to a 

pamphlet put out 
Graduate student had cu I t leaders 

by the Oflil:c of Re lig iolls Affai rs. 
cult s like to target college campus-
es and college students. 

The pamphlet slates that co l-
lege provides the perfec t opportu -
nity for cu lt s hecause it l:reates an 
environment that hreeds vulnera-
bi lity. For cxample, homcsickness 
c;ln OCl:ur wh~n students arc away 
from home for the fi rst timc, or 
some students may have a tough 
time tilling in sOl:ially. 

According to Wagner, cult s 
know about these vulnerahil ities 
and prey on them. He descrihed a 
tac ti c ca ll ed "love-bombing:' a 
tac tic in which the new cult mem-
ber is surrounded by uncondition-
al love and acceptance until they 
arc initiated into the group. Once 
the indi vidual hecomes hooked 
into the cult. it becomes very hard 
for thelll to leave. Many students 

resort ing to hlack-
mail in order to keep me mbers 
from leaving. 

Wagner sa id he once had a stu -
dent tell him that he had conlided 
in a cult leader that he had L.: heated 
on a math lesl his freshman year. 
When he was about to graduate 
four years later, the cult leader told 
hi m he was going to report his 
offense to the dean if he decided to 
leave the cult, therefore not allow-
ing him to graduate. The student , 
however. did graduate and eventu-
all y left the cult. 

The Office of Religious AITairs 
represents a variety of religious 
heliefs, including 1cwish, Roman 
Catholic, Lutheran, Preshyterian, 
Methodist. Episcopalian and 
Baptist. It encourages students to 
talk to them about religious life 
and questions revolving around 
religious faith .

Bowling and mistaken identity Page 10 

Despite the rel:ent commercial victory of 
the techno/rave scene, live music still rules the 
world, as evidenced by the ever-increasing 
popularity of the Hollywood club circuit. 

San Diego does have its share of great clubs 
scallered around the county. but lacks the his-
tory, atmosphere and centralized location that 
Hollywood's Sunset Stri p provides, located 
just a couplc hours up the freeway. 

Here is a guide to some of Holl ywo d's 
most frequented live music clubs. 
The Whlak, A Go-Go 
8901 Sunset Blvd. 

Tile Whisky is one of the three main all-
ages, genera l-admission live-music clubs in 
Holl ywood, the other tw being The Roxy and 
Trouhadour. Of these, The Whisky is probably 
the most famous due to its central location and 
strong affi liations with bands such as The 
Doors and Van Halen. 

Tn more recent years, the club, which has a 
capacity of only about 500 people, has fea-
tured the likes of Marilyn Manson and Cake. 
On most nights, however, The WhL ky show-
cases local or unsigned bands. often whose 
members arc in college or high school. 

For many of these newer band ' who have 
not yet developed a draw (a ti cket-pu rchasing 
fan base), the club operates on a "pay-to-rlay" 
basis. That is. the band will buy a cenain num-
ber of ti(;kets (about $10 to $ 15 at the door) 
from the club ahead of time at a discounted 
rate, and from that point it is the band 's 
responsibility to earn its money back through 
ticket sales. 

"But that's not the point of the club." 
Whisky representative Mike Wilson aid. 
''Basically, the pay-to-play thing is so that we 
can make enough money to keep the doors 
open."

Falling Short of a Perfect 300 
The Big Lebowski' doesn't compare to the (oen brothers' hits 

lyA ...... Amir 
Guard ian Reporter 

Gram merl:Y Pi l: lUreS' "The Big 
Lcbowski ," is the ti rst fi lm in 
three years to cmerge fro m Ihe 
creat ive minds of director Joe l 
Cocn and hi s brother, producer 
Ethan Coen. The two bro thers, 
who co-write all Iheir fil ms, won 
popular and critical acclaim fo r 
1995's ··Fargo." 

Unfortunately, compared to 
"Fargo"'s success ful blend of 
grotesque humor, shoding vio-
lence and an indelihle upstale-
Minnesota selling, 'The Big 
Lehowski," slarring Jeff Bridges, 
Juli anne Moore and John Good-
man, pa les in comparison. 

Nevertheless, Coen fans can al 
least appreciate the li lm 's quirk i-
ness and satiric effort s - even if 
I hey do not all add up. 

Jeff Bridges (complete with a 
shaggy goatee and pOlbe lly), pl ays 

the lil le ro le of Jeff Lehowski. 
Lehowski is a carefree, midd le-
aged si mpleton; an unemployed 
sloh who is mistakenly taken for 
someone else, and drawn into a 
kid napping plot that pits him 
aga inst a powerful charl atan, 
some vio lcnt nihili sls, porn indus-
try thugs, a vapid teenager and a 
sadisti c sheriff. 

Through a succession of 
ahs urdities, Ihe Coens usc suhtle 
satire to mock everYlhing from 
Madonna's impregnalion to Far-
rah Fawcell 's nude body pai nl ing. 
Even the recenl success of "Boo-
gie Nighls" is acknow ledged 
(Moore appeared in both li lms), 
as one character laments the pass-
ing of hquality porn" wi th the 
int roduction of home video. 

In addi tion, voke-over narra-
tion prov ides the li lm with some 
flippanl analyses, casting Lehows-
ki as an everyman, and weakly 

San Diego Pre",iere! 

allempl ing to lend the film a sense 
of openi ng and closure. 

Wilh a nod to Quentin Taranti-
no, "The Big Lebowski"-set in 
Los Angeles 1990-offers pop cul-
ture references such as In 'N' Out 
Burger and Ralph 's supermarkets. 
However, it fails to inspire interest 
in the mundane as Tarantino did 
so we ll in, for example, "Pulp Fic-
tion." 

Compared 10 "Raising Ari -
zona," Ihe hilarious 1987 Coen 
hrolhers movie, "Lebowski" is a 
somewhat heavy-handed comedy. 
But wi th the help of the Coens' 
fami liar ensemble cast, ind uding 
Steve Buscemi and John Turtur-
ro, the fi lm exposes the grotesque 
fo und in everyday life and pro-
vides enough laughs - at least 
for it s eventu al video release.

'WOOp, Woop' Fails 
Experimental film falter from lack of 

human interaction 
Iy Kathryne Lee 
Staff Wflter 

Fo llowing in the footsteps of 
"Pul p Ficti on" and "Fargo" comes 
the new ultra-violcnt , ultra -oh,cene 
li lm "Welcome to Woop, Woop," a 
, urrea l, ac ti on/drama/comedy 
ahout a town straight from a 1950, 
hel l. 

"Welcome to Woop, Woop" is 
an experimenta l IiIms that audi -
ences will either hate or deem 
ingenious. To a l:rowd of testos-
terone-dri ve n, sex-crazed co llege 
students, it may just seule wi th the 
laller. Unfortunately, the outlandish 
gaudiness of the lilm and the lack 
of a ~ t ory line out weighs the fl:w 
unique Sl:enes thaI can surpass 
Tarantino in origi nalilY. 

Teddy (Jonathan Schael:h) is 
an immoral, Mac hiuve li an con 
man who is drugged and kid-
napped. His kidnappers take hi m 
to the desened outbacks of Aus-
tralia. Once there, he fi nds him-
self in a disgusting hick-LOwn 
named Woop, Woop. When he 
emerges from his drug- indul:ed 
stupor, he fi nds himself betrothed 
to sex-crazed Angie. 

The town, run by Angie's tyran-
nical father, is a place that has been 
blotted off the map and for good 
reason. It is entrenched in filth, 
where the people live slightly bet-
ter than the swine. Their staple diet 
consists of Spam and canned 
pineapples and the only music and 
Ii Ims that can be played are old 
renditions of "Rodgers & Hammer-
stei n" and musicals, such as "Mary 
Poppins" and "South Seas," of 
which the inhabitants know every 
word. 

A foul rec ipe minci ng road-
kill meat wiJ h an un fa ithful hus-
band 's carcass produces "Woof, 
Woof," a dog food that seems to 
be the onl y soun;e uf income ror 

thi s sorry little lown. 
There are onl y I W () rul e~ in 

Woop, Woop. The firsl: you l:;] n 
never "dink " your cousins. The 
second : you can never leave. Thi ~ 
sets up it di lemma for wrclched 
Teddy, who~c only wish i, 10 ge t 
out of Ihe hi l: k-IOwn and out of hi ~ 
shol-gun marriage 10 hi ~ psychoti c 
wife. 

There's plenty of sex (il seems 
there's not much cI e to do in the 
Auslralian oUlhack) , fl opping 
breasls. obscenity (mom faning 
because of an overload of Spam) 
and enough road-ki II ' roo mcat to 
make a roomful of bu limics never 
want to cat again. 

In terms of artislic inlegrilY. thi s 
111m is by far no "Adventures of 
Pri ,ci ll a, Queen of the Dcsert. " 
Instead, il is morc like "Nalural 
Born Ki ll ers" mixed in with the 
corniness of "From Dusk 10 Dawn" 
and the obscenilY of "Porky's." 

Considering that director 
Slephen Elliott 's firs t fi lm 
("Prisl:illa") won him an Academy 
Award, "Welcome 10 Woop, Woop" 
is a bit disappointing. Although il 
has Elliou's trademark of quirky 
surrealism, it lacks the finesse of 
human interacti on. In stead, it 's 
simply a ti lm composed of disgust-
ing film clips, juxtaposed on top of 
each other, made purely for the 
benelit of a laugh. 

The last word about this sorry 
little film : Unless you arc a VA 
major, save your money. You prob-
abl y won't be able to appreciate it , 
or even care to. If your signilicant 
other is a VA major and cajoles you 
into corning along, remember 10 
take some Adv il be fore Ihe fi lm . If 
you don'I, you may find yourse lf 
wi th a scream ing headache after-
wards. 

"Welcome to Woop, Woop" wi ll 
be re leased on March 20.

hAn artistic work is a resul t of 
Ihe moment of insanity and emo-
tional di m3x," she said. "When a 
creation comes, I musl paint unt il 
it 's out of me." 

The resu lt ing paint ings nre pow-
erful and dramatic. She approaches 
each new can vas with intense 
focus , determ inalion and holdness. 

Afshar was horn in Mashad, 
Iran . Three years later her fami ly 
moved to Tehran , where she was 
raised . 

Sad ly, her crealivity was neilher 
noti ced nor encouraged. 

Her falher, a memhcr of Ihe 

Iranian army, broughl the military 
regime inlo his home and demand-
ed absolule and immediate ohedi-
ence. 

He was a devout Muslim, and 
forced all of his family memhers to 
practice religious riluals severa l 
limes a day. Those who did not 
obey were severely pun ished. 

When Afshar was a little gi rl , 
her fa ther insisted that she perform 
innu merab le household chores , 
includ ing selling the table for 13 
people Ihree times a day and 
bahysi ll ing at a moment 's noti ce. 

In addi tion, her falher demand-
ed' that she wake up hy 6 o'clock 
every morn ing to start work. If she 
didn ' l wake up on time, he would 
throw cold waler over her unti l she 
was up and movi ng. 

Afshar's fa ther had two wives, 
wh ich is permissible by the Islamic 
fai th . He had to support two house-
ho lds and 17 children . No matter 
how much money he earned, there 
was never enough to go around -
certainly not enough for luxuries 
like movie" te lev isions or nights 
on Ihe town . 

When she was 7 years old, 

Afshar starled formal educalion. 
Un happi ly, school did not prov ide 
<l ny relief from the stric l rul es 
wh ich guverned each and every 
aspecl of her life . 

Yet despile Ihe grim and harsh 
environmenl, Afshar ', arli stic spir-
it proved to be indomitable. 

When she was 4 year~ old, she 
would gather scraps of material her 
mother did not need. and usc it to 
stu ff do ll s. 

"Sometimes in the morning I' d 
cry and pretend thaI I didn't fee l 
we ll enough 10 go to schoo l," she 
said . "Then later I'd get up and 
make doll dothes and do ll houses. I 
loved bei ng creative and doi ng my 
own thing." 

A few years lale r, Afshar 
became interesled in soccer. She 
ran a sma ll ad in the local newspa-
pcr aski ng thaI any woman i Ilterest-
cd in joining a soccer leam call her. 
Allhough she received a good 
response and the leam operated for 
one year, Ihe criti cism she re(.;eived 
from memhers of her rami ly and 
from the ma le popU lation of the 
commu nity became unbearahle.

12 HIATUS The UCSD Guardian 

Claire Schneldcr/ GuardliJn 
Solo: Irwin's Conspiracy will play at CM Cafe this Saturday. 

Conspiracy at the Che 
Irwin mixes drum In/bass with electronica sound 

By S8IIdy Unk 
Special to the Guardian 

The GlIardian was denied an interview 
with Irwin of Irwin 's Conspiracy because 
of hi s shy di spositi on. However, informa-
tion of his past and present mu sical 
endeavors helps to make sense of the expe-
ri ence of Irwin 's Con~ pirac y's live perfor-
mances. 

Irwin has played with The Beastie Boys; 
David Navarro of Janc's Addiction and The 
Red Hot Chili Peppers; Will Cooper of 
Mazzy Star; Fred Wesley from James 
Brown's band; Carl Denson and Herald 
Todd, who played with Lenny Kravitz; and 
Rickie Lee Jones and John Calc of the Vel-
vet Underground. He has also recorded <m a 
slew of CDs. 

Irwin lives d ose to the UCSD campus 
and is airing out hi s lalest twist on music al 
the Che Cufe on Man:h 7. 

If rrwi n 's last performance is indicati ve, 
anything is poss ible at hi s nex I show. 
Irwin 's last performam:e was a chaotic mi x 
of groaning samples lined from porn fli cks, 
heautiful serene soundscapes, huckwards 
analog-synthes izers and inll:nsc, li ve drulll-
ming. 

ACl:Ord ing to Irwin, it could be charac-
teri zed as a cross between the sounds of 
"drum ' n'. bass, electroni ca and sex in the 
rain forest." 

Irwin typi cally utilizes MIDI-theremine 
and a digital echoplex to crea te li ve sound 
loops, electronic and acoustic drums, a sam-
pler and occasionally, a sequencer. 

Lately, Irwin's Conspiracy have been a 
solo performance. 

When asked if hi s Chc Cafe perfor-
mance will be a solo effor! , Irwin 's only 
answer was a short story about how he 
recently got a ti cket fo r hav ing hi s dog on 
the beach. 

Along with the mus i ~ will be an exquis-
ite visual show pro vided by Gregg Leeper of 
Opticlls Organic us. 

Leeper also docs the visuals for big raves 
and national touring bands such as The 
Electri c Sky Church. 

Irwin 's Conspiracy will also be perform-
ing li ve for UCS D's KSDT Radio and 
SRTV, Cox Cubit: 95 .7 FM and SOllthwc,t-
ern Cable Channel 4 1 on Apr. 13 at 9 p.m. 

Irwin 's Conspiracy will appear at th~ 
Chc Calc on Saturday at 9:30 p.lll. with Tur-
tle and Worm whole Effect. 

HOLLYWOOD: 
Take in some live music 
on the famed Sunset Strip 
Continued from ..... I 

Si nce its openi ng in the mid ' 60s, the 
club has evolved and ~ hangcd , featuri ng 
huge acts from Led Zeppelin 10 The Mighty 
Migh ty Boss tones, while conMu ntl y re nect-
ing the current Hollywood scene through 
up·and-coming acts. Recentl y, more elec-
tro nic a<.: ts like GusGus have pl ayed there as 
well. 

"The ~ Iu b has been here for so long, it 's 
just like an old horse," Wilson ,a id. "Every-
body knows The Whi'ky." 
The Roxy 
1009 Sunset Blvd. 

The Roxy IS ,or! of The Whisky's sister 
duh in sil.e, age and pirit. Located a few 
shon blocks west of The Whisky, it fea-
ture, all types of live musi c from newer 
ac ts, occas ionally luri ng bigger hands like 
Da nce Hall Crashers, Bryan Adams and 
Yoko Ono over the past cou ple ye u" . In 
fact , Frank Zappa and Jane', Addiction 
have both recorded live alhums from The 
Roxy. 

Like The Whisky, The Roxy sometimes 
operate, on a pay-to-play ha,is, depe nd ing 
on a band 's draw. 

Unlike The Whisky, The'Roxy has been 
rateo the number-one cl ub in L.A. two yea rs 
in a row by Music COllllection magazine, an 
award based on band quality, lighting, sound 
and attendance rates. 

According to Roxy representati ve Edie 
Oenhen, countless bands get signed out of 
the d ub. 

"If they ' re big now, they ' ve probably 
played The Roxy," he said. 
The Troublldour 
9011 Santa Monica Blvd. 

The Troubadour is simil ar in size and 
fea tured musi~ to The Roxy and The 
Whisky, but m:ver makes hands pay to play. 

"Any moron can hu y a stage, it doesn't 
mean he's talented, so we a void I pay-to-
pl ay I like the plague," Troubadour represen· 
tati ve Steve Tate explai ned. "We leave that 
to our friends up on the strip." 

Consequent Iy. bands who perform at The 
Troubadour have already developed a draw. 

Tate said thai music lahe l sco ut s freqllent 
the club searching ror fresh talent. 

"Probably what regula rs we have are 
industry peo ple ,:' he said. "They come 
because they know we'rc hooking ba nds 

Thursday, March 5, 1998 

that can dra'w and that the music is good, 
and that 's what they' re looking for." 

Some national acts that have hit the 
Troubadour in the past yea r include Elvis 
Costello, Marcy Playground and Days of the 

ew, along wit h ele<.: tronica art is ts like 
Go ldie. 
The Hou .. of BIu •• 
1430 Sun .. t Blvd. 

The Hou~e of Bl ues is a bigger, newer, 
21-and-up venue, with a capadty crowd of 
800. It showcases re lati vely large acts every 
night of the week such as Jonn y Lang, 
Rak im and the Reverend Horton Heat. Con-
seque ntl y, tickets are usually pricier Ihan at 
the smaller clu hs. 

The club has a res taurant and retail , tnrc 
allached, cl nd al,o se rves as a museulll . fea -
turing the ~econd large,t co llection of folk 
art in the wu ntry. 

"Tlle How,e or Blucs is not like any 
other venue you'vc been to," H.O.B. rep-
resenlative Sharon Livitem ~aid . " It does-
n' t look , fec i or sound like any other 
venue." 

I-I .O.B. is actua ll y a corporation, boast· 
ing such celebrity investors as Dan Aykroyd. 
J am e.~ Belu shi and Aerosmith. There arc ~ix 
Hou,es nationwioe, wi th the possibility of a 
new one turning up in San Diego sometime 
in the ncar future. 
Billboard Uve 
9039 Sun .. t Blvd. 

Billboard Li ve is another bigger 2 1-and-
up club that has appeared on the Strip in the 
past few years. It is a three-story multimedi a 
entertainment center with 20 video screens, 
a video editing fadlit y and a criti call y 
acclaimed restaurant. 

The dub (affili ated only by name to the 
magazine) reatures live music, but brings in 
DJs four days a week for a more dance-
related vibe. 

By way of compari son, 'The DJs some-
limes bring in huge crowds, but nothing's as 
big as a big band - they do the best," said 
Greg Wadley, director of publicity for Bill-
boa rd Li ve. 

Some of those well-known a~t s to play 
the club rece ntl y have been Dwight 
Yoakam, Suicidal Tendencies and George 
Clinton . 

"The clu b gives I Hollywood I a touch of 
something morc modern , a little more glam-
orous," Wadley sa id. 

So stop w rnplaining about how thcre is 
nothing to do here, and go support live 
music in the entertainmen t capital of the 
wo rld .

14 SPORTS The CS D Guardian 

UCSD Snaps The Streak 
NEW STREAK: The Tritons beat CSU San Bernardino for the second time 

Previously, in its e(;-
ond match of the ,eason, 

CSD headed north and 
won a hard-fought 
match In the oyo te,' 
home gy m. Since that 
point , the Tri t on ~ had hit 
a dry spell. 

Despit e the news that 
juni or outside hitter 
Jody Cook-Fi sher, a 
valuable contrihut or, 
would be taking a red-
shirt season due to an 
injury, UC D was able 
to field a relatively 
healthy lineup . With 
junior Devon Jeffcoat 
returning after shoulder 
problems that had kept 
him out agai nst Hawaii 
the lineup looked good. 

UCSD played it s 
most consistent match 
of the year, beating the 
Coyotes in four games. 

Monkia Kobylecka/ Guardl8n 
Ups: Senior outside hitter Ryan Woods 
gets way up to slam home a kill. 

The Tritons opened 
game one by quick ly 
falling hchind by 5 
points. Sensing that hi s 
team needed to ca lm 
down. McFarland ca lled 
a timeout. The Tritons By Steve Walsh 

Senior Slaff Wriler 
If there was ever a team in need 

of a win, it was the UCSD men 's 
volleyball squad. 

Forl:ed into playing in the 
toughest Division I conferem:e in 
the nation, the Tritons had been 
laking their lumps recently, drop-
ping nine consecutive matches to 
a who's- who li st of powerhouse 
volleyball teams. 

Enter Cal State San Bernardi -
no. and a stunning Triton viclory. 

responded by rattling off 9 unan-
swered points. 

While the Coyotes were falling 
apart. UCSD was hilling its stride. 
A huge kill by senior Jon Yarris 
and a service ace by sellcr Kurt 
SeckinglOn made things oflil:ial, 
as UCSD game one. 15-9. 

Seckington. who has done an 
admirable job quarterlnll:king the 
Triton offense against it , Division 
I opponent,. took his game to 
another Icvel against S SB . 

In addition to his three ace~. 
Sel: kington provided Ihe biggesl 

block~ of the match. Hi ~ 61 a,si,t s 
were a match high and I he cmo-
tion he broughl to the coort elevat-

ed the play or hi ~ 
teammate,. 

Another ,010 
block by Sl.!ck -
inglon and a 
back row kill by 
Woods forced 
San Bernardino 
to l:a ll a timeoul , 
down 8-1. 

The Coyotes would manage to 
cut into the Triton lead but it 
wou ld be too little too late as 
junior Bill Sinclair closed out 
game two wi th a solo block of his 
own. Final score of game two'! 

Game three saw the ortkials 
playa critical role. With the two 
teams ball ling back and forth. the 
officials appeared to miss a num-
ber of ball -handling error~ by the 
Coyote, that co,t the Tritons 
points. San Bernardino would take 
advantage of Ihese ca ll s to take the 
third. with the game ending on a 
4uestionablc toudl against the Tri -
ton block. 

Not about to let the ofticials 
play a role in the fourth , UCSD 
closed out the matl:h with Seck-
ington taking Ihe spotlight. A pair 
of blocks and a se rvice ace put the

Crew Wins Big 
SMOOTH: The Tritons dominated in their opener 
By Kevin McLaughlin 
Co·Associate Sports Editor 

Streamlined hulls fla shing 
Ih rough the water at ama;!ing 
~peed . Oar, , plashing and dipping . 
Muscles heavin g and 
'Irai ning. Eighl men or 
women moving in unison. 
Th.: , port of .:rew is the 

~ turt or poctry. 
But no time to wax elo-

quenl - last Sa turday, the 
I1lcn ' ~ and women 's crew 
teams quit their preseason 
splashing about and got 
down to bu~iness . Opening the year 
in Newport Harbor with a dual 
meet against UC Irvine. both 
squads got off to a smooth start. 

For the men, a seasoned set of 
rowers returned to the water wilh 
great results, showing the Anteaters 
that water is the undeniable domain 
of the Tritons with a sweep of UCI. 
However, the results for the women 
were mixed as they caplured onl y 
the open-weighl division . 

"I rea lly believe we were just at 
a mud1 highcr level than them," 
men's Coa.:h Mike Filippone said. 
"We arc obvious ly one of the beller 
teams in Sout hern Californ ia . It 's 
cither us or ICSU I Long Beal:h ." 

The men dominated in all four 
races, winning the varsity eight-
man racc in 6: 14.5 - 6 seconds, or 
nearly two boat-lengths. ahead of 
Irvine. This despite an early jump 
from the stroke oar that could have 
proved disastrous but was qui ckly 
ri ghted. 

It would onl y get better for the 
Tritons. as the varsity four-man 
.:rew ~wamped CI by just under 8 
seconds. 'ovice action. generall y 
the arena for tir~l - yea r strokers, 

was also ruled by CSD, with both 
the four- and eight -man shells win-

. ning easily. The cight-man team 
I: :tmc in an impressivc 16 ~econu s 
In front of the Antealer~' rival boat. 

For the women, the 
meet wa, a little more 01 a 
mixed hag. The va rsi ty 
women 's open-weight 
di vision boat perfo rmcd as 
expected, ea, il y hes ling 
the Anteaters. 

The varsity women also 
fi elded a li ghtweight 
squad. for those under 130 

Ibs. As UCI has no li ghtweight 
team , the women raced aga inst the 
open wmpetition, meeting with 
equipment problems and fini shing 
a di sappointing third. 

UC I captured ral:es against both 
women's novil:e squads. giving the 
Anteaters. who were supposed to 
be wm parahl e to UCSD's women. 
thei r only victories of the day. 

"Our novices raced hal'll." 
women 's Head Coach Ja.:k Valler-
ga ~aid , "but they didn ' t row tech-
nically as well as they should 
have ." 

This weekend, another dual 
meet. this time at rival CSU Long 
Beach, looms ahead. For the men. 
particularly, thi s should be a good 
barometer of what to expect from a 
team that has high hopes. 

The dual meet should provide 
another good ea rly-season warm-
up for the women before entering 
regatta acti on . starting with the San 
Diego Crew Classil: on the lirst 
weekend of Apri I. The women lield 
a team lhat is 40 decp, stepping up 
the leve l of intersquad competition 
and hopeful ly bolstering the team 
as a whole.

Tritons Get Second Win in Santa Barbara 
TRIPLE OVERTIME: UCSD lost a i-point lead in the last second of the game, but managed a victory in sudden-death overtime 
By Jonah Nisenson 
Co-Associate Sports Edllor 

If it seems as if the UCSD 
women's water polo team is on the 
road playi ng in gamcs and tourna-
ment s more than alt ending 
sd100l and it\ pretty close 
to true. The last two week-
ends the Tritons ha ve 
taken their leave of La 
Jolla 10 bask in the sun of 
some tropi l: al ~i ti es. 

Hawaii served as the 
Tritons' gc taway two 
weekends ago whi Ie Santa 
Barhara was Ihe hOi SpOI Ihi s past 
weekend . UCSD l:umpetcd in the 
Gaucho 16-Tcam Women's Water 
Polo In vi tati onal hosted by UCSB 
last Wednesday Ihrough Sunday. 

TlllI~ lur thi s s\.:uson, the UCSD 
wo men's water polo teum has yet 10 
playa Div ision III tea m and thi s 
tournament proved to be no differ-
ent. Powerh ouses like UCLA. 
Berkeley unu 'tanford - all schol -
arship programs - have subdued 
the Tritons handily in each of their 
meetings . 

So. when o. I I UCSD saddled 
up for its four-hour voyage north to 
Santa Barbara, th..: Tritons wcre not 
exac tl y expel:ting to dominate any-
one. They were. however. ex pecl-
i ng to perfo rm b\.:yond any of the 

other team 's ex pectations. 
The 1-3 performan.:e did hUl:k 

some people, parti cularly 0. 6 C 
Davis . UCD harely beat thc Tri -
IOns. 4-3, in the Invitational \ sev-

enth-pla.:c game ina heat -
ed Sunday iJallle, the last 
day of Ihe tou rn ament. 

UCS D's one win of the 
tournament was an H-? 
vil:tory agai nst San J ()~e 
Slate Uni versi ty. its sec-
ond win against SJS in 
two mcetings. 

"In paM tournaments 
we arc just phys ically and mentally 
spent when the Sunday game rolls 
around and not ready to step up and 
play good water polo." Head Coach 
Denny Harper said. "But against 
Da vis, we played an awesome 
game defensively. We took a 3-2 
lead into the fourth quarter. hut 
unfortunately l o~t it. We arc ~ till 
reall y young and had three or four 
good ~ han~es 10 score where we 
should have. but we were out scored 
2-0 in the last quarter." 

In its lirst game and onl y win of 
the eX lemled weekend. UCSD had 
a 5-4 lead with one second left in 
th \.: g.lIne. Somehow, SJSU man-
aged an il1lpos~ible goal wi th time 
expiring. ,ending the ga me to over-
lime. 

"We had Ihe game won with one 
~ccond left in regulation. bUI we 
blew it," Harper said. "More times 
than not, the team that gives up a 
goa l like Ih al usually loses because 
of Ihe pSYl:hologil:al disadvantage. 
BUI I was pleased with how we 
responded in l' l1l1lch time aft cr we 
gave up Ihat goal." 

Despite what see med like a 
backbreaking last-second Spartan 
goal . the Tritons wenl into the first 
overtime looki ng like they rea ll y 
wanted it. 

After Harper ca ll ed a tinlcout 10 
scI a perfect play that resulted in a 
UCSD score. the Spartans respond-
ed wi th a goal of Iheir own. sending 
the game to douhle-overtime. 

Eac h team again put th e ball 
away once in the period. hut still 
th ey were neck-and-neck. Then. in 
, uddell-death overtime, freshman 
Sandra Lopel. lir 'd a shot i'rom 12-
mcters out that was tipped by a 
SJS U lield player. The misd ir~cti ()n 
sent the ball over Ihe goa lie's head 
for her third goal of the day and 
propelled thc Tritons into the win-
Tlcr's bra.:ket. 

Freshman Hilary Smith also had 
3 goals on the day. while junior 
Jenny Irwin and ~ophomore Angie 
Kondrat each scored OIKe. 

"We knew we had to comc out 

and beat them," junior Kathryn 
Ola"i said. " It shouldn ' t ha ve been 
as close as it was. hut it ended up 
that w.IY,'· 

The fo llowing game <I!!alnst last 
year's '0 . I team. LA. saw the 
Tritons fa ll at Ihe hands of a 
Goliath-like tealll . The 17-2 linal 
was relle.: tive of a national dl:tmpi-
onshir-ca liher tealll who is out to 
prove once again that it is the hest. 

De~pit e lo,i ng in the championship 
game 01 Ihe tourtl<llllenl to Cal. 

CLA displayed th at it is still a 
conl 'n ler. 

"The CLA game was clearly a 
good spanking," H<lrper said . "But . 
we ar~ rcally closing Ihe gap on 
somc of the heller teams and we arc 
ahead () r the gmne CO Ill pa red 10 
when: we were la~t year at thi s 
time," 

In it s third ga mc of the tourney. 
C D played a hard-follghl game 
agai n~ 1 San Diego State. The 
A/.tees led 3-0 al Ihe half. hut the 
Tritons pulled 3 goals s~c' minily 
out of nowhere in Ihe third quarter 
to give SDSU a run for it s money. 

"We tend to pick it up in the ~ec ­
ond half of our game,: ' Ozaki ~aid . 
"The sewnd hal I' was rr~ll y cillse 
againsl State. a 101 closer than the 
score indi l:ates. Had we played two 
m re quarter~ we prohably could 

havc beat them." 
SDSU el'entually won the game. 

9-5 .. Sc:oring for the Tritons were 
Smith (2 goa ls), Kondrat ( I). Ozaki 
( I) and Lopez ( I ). 

"Stale 's coa.:hes were more than 
concerned with the fourth quarter 
of Ihe gam ,," Harper commented. 
"They didn ' t walll to comc out of 
the g:lme with ink on their fal:es." 

Facing a four- to six-week 
ahsc lll:c of stalwart sophomore 
Dara Burch (hroken halld). UCSD 
went into the weekend looking for 
some people to step up. 

" I was conce rned as heck going 
into the weekend without Dara 
Bur.:h. who is an excellent ballhan-
dlcr:' Harper said . "I thought this 
could he a rough weekend, but the 
team really responded . Sandra 
Lopel in partil:u lar played well." 

pcoming is a two-week rest 
for the travel-weary Tritons and 
then they head olT to the Clarcmont 
Co llege Invitational Mardl 20-22. 
The Tritons wi ll thell embark upon 
what water polo players term "hell ' 
week" - a week of intense condi-
tioning ami training during whidl 
the rest of the student body wi II be 
lounging in a tropical paradise on 
their spring hreak vacation with 
bottles of sun -tan lotion and mar-
garitas in their hands.

Tritons Have Unpleasant 
Visit to Thousand Oaks 
MASON: Despite an amazing day from senior shortstop Mark 
Mason, who hit 3 2-run homer , UCSD lost to Cal Lu, 8-7 
By John Maynard 
Staff Writer 

You 've seen it on every high school 
spons T-shin : 'T here 's no 'I' in tea m." Well. 
fo r CSD baseball there may he no " I" in 
team, hu t dammit , there's an HM." 
And on Tuesday. that "M" ~ t ood for 
team captain Mark Mason. 

Very simply, senior shorl stop 
Mason went huge against the 

King~men of Califomia Lutheran 
University. Mason did SOllIe major 
yard work in taking three balls oul. 
dri vi ng a total of 6 out of the 7 runs 
on the day for UCSD. 

Despite Mason's single- handed shell ack-
ing of Cal Lu pitching, Mason's trio of 2-run 
homers were not enough as the Tritons lost 
their seventh game of the year. 8-7. 

Everything start ed off well for the Tri-
tons as UCSD opened the game with a solid 
3-run lirst inning. With a runner on base, 
Mason stepped up to the plate and hit his 
first of th ree shots over the le ft -fi eld fence. 

Cal Lutheran an~wered with a run of its 
own in the hottom of the first against Triton 
staner Eddie Ishak . 

UCSD, however. was not ra ttl ed. The 
Tritons extended their lead in the top of the 
third , as Mason aga in smacked one out of 
the yard for 2 more RBis, giving the Tritons 
a 5-1 advantage over the Ki ngsmen. 

UCSD held the Kingsmen scoreless in 
the hattom of the third, but gave up another 
run in the latter ha lf of the fourth inning. 

With the score 5-2. UCSD took the plate 
in the top of the li fth hopi ng to break the 

game wide open. Just how the lirst and third 
in l1 i ng~ deve loped, the fift h had the same 
outcome, as Mason talli ed his th ird homer 
and fi nal pair of RBis fo r the d:1Y. 

Wh ile the Tnton~ we re heginni ng to 
enjoy their vi sit to Ca l Lu theran. 
the Kingsme/l were determined to 
not let the Triton, lind anything 
pleasi ng ahout Thousand Oaks. In 
the bOllom of the ~ ixt h ion ing, Cal 
Lut hcran began its comehack, scor-
ing a run . 

The Triton ' wc rcn' t phased, a ~ 
they still had a 4-run lead. But 
UCS D hegan to show fatigue in the 

bottom of the seventh . 
After a 2-ru n blast, an RBI-single and a 

sacrifice ny, the Tritons found themselves 
facing a tied ball-game. 

The Tri tons sucked up their seventh-
inn ing hlunder, and staged a retaliation in 
the top of the eighth . Unfortunately. the Tri-
tons were unable to hri ng any runners a<.:ross 
the plate. 

The bottom of the eighth was un lucky for 
the Kingslllen, ~e ll i ng up for a most interest-
ing ninth in ning. Unfortunately. the Tritons 
came up empt y-handed in their half of the 
ninth , and were forced to keep their fingers 
crossed for the final Kingslllen at-hat. 

What started out as a gooJ game quickly 
became a ni ghtmare for the Tritons in the 
bottom of the ni nt h; Brian Malchow stepped 
up to the plate and slapped a game-winning 
homer. leaving the Tritons wi th s ur feel-
ings ahout Thousand Oaks and the hated 
Kingsmen of al Lu .

Crusaders Cruise Over

fo r revenge. However. they staned slowl 
again wi th Point Lorna scoring 2 early runs 
on pitcher Erin Flanigan.

The Crusaders would not ro ll 

over wi thout a ti ght. however, scor-
ing a run in the seventh. The Tritons 
had a scoreless seventh and the SOFTBAll game went to extra innings. One 

more inning was all the Crusaders would 
need as they scored an unearned run in the 
to p of the eighth , and the Tritons could not 
match it. With the two losses, UCS D's 
record falls to 5-5 on the season. 

The UCSD softball team fee ls the same 
way you do. The Tri tons arc headed to 
Orlando, Fla. for their spring hreak so per-
haps they had good reason to he a little 
dreamy when they hit the field against Point 
Lo III a aZ.lrene o llege on Tuesday. It 
turned out to he a tough ni ght for CS D as 
it lost two to the Crusaders. 6- 1 and 4-3. 

In th e lirst game. UCSD star1ed slugg ish-
ly and d id not record it s first hi t un til the 
sixth inning. The only run was scored in the 
second inning when shortstop Erin Bridges 
reached on a two-base error hy the left fie ld -
er, was sacrificed over to third and s<.:Ored on 
a passed ball. 

From then on, nothing went right fo r 
UCSD. The Tritons' usually strong defense 
was suspect wi th 4 errors while pitcher Alli -
son Jacobs had an OfT-game as well , giv ing 
up 8 hit s a llll 3 earned ru ns to the Crusaders.

Tuesday evening was not a typical per-
formance for the Tritons. and whi le it was 
di scouraging, they refu se to li ve in the past. 

" It was a rough loss because the team 
was beatah le," Wilson said . "We were 
bummed, but now we 're just looking for-
ward to playing IAugustana College J nex t 
Saturday." 

The Tri tons play Augustana, II I. next Sat-
urday and Whittier College on Tuesday 
before heading [ 0 Orlando. 

"We're thrilled to he going and I hope we 
do rea lly well." Wilson said when asked 
ahout the trip to Florida. 

Let's just hope they can keep thoughts of 
oranges and the Sunshine State out of their 
heads for just a few more games.

could just keep all of its players on

four mi nut es of the second half. 
From there the lead went back and 
forth, and with UCS D relying on 
the ph ysical play of Mike Bouch 
and the stellar goaltending of Sam 
Alquist. it had a chance. 

When the final whistle blew, 
though, the men came up one goa l 

UCSD hosted two matches thi s

over USC, 8-7, and an I 1-6 loss to 
Ari zona State on Saturday. All 
th ings considered. though, the 
weekend was a success. 

SATURDAY, MARCH 7 

EQUESTRIAN: Inter-colle-
giate Horse Show, 9 a.m. at 
Sweetwater Emns in Bonita 

Last weekend the men traveled 
to NorCnl for hac k-to-back games 
against Stanford University and St. 
Mary's College and played very 
well in their first league contests of 
the season. 

They lost 15- 14 to the No. 8 
ranked Cardinal but bounced the 
Gaels, 8-2. UCS D could very well 
have returned home with 2 victo-
ries. hut penalties kept each oppo-
nent with a seemingly constant 
man-advantage . 

In Salurday's contest aga inst 
Stanford, UCSD was thi nking 
upset. The men stormed into the 
opening minutes with 7 quick 
goals. But penalt ies allowed the 
veteran Cardinal to claw back into 
the game. 

Stanford tinally evened things 
up by scori ng 5 goals in the !irst 

shon. . 
UCSD rebounded on Sunday 

against 51. Mary 's, but from the 
looks of the opening minu tes. it 
could have been a long day. The 
Gaels came out and grahbed an 
early 3-2 lead. 

The men battled back, however, 
and dominated the second half on 
both ends of the field. 

Led on the defensive end by 
Bouch, Mike Cummings and Keit h 
Warnerda m. UCSD looked impen-
etrable. The great defense also led 
to scoring opportuniti es for Frank 
Lemes and Dan Cohan, who made 
the most of what they got. 

Things arc defini te ly looking 
good for UCSD as it heads into its 
nex t match. a battle against Clare-
mont this weekend.

Imagine thi s: you have a fi eld. 
you have the equipment, the oppos-
ing team is ready. but you can 't 
play. Repeat said situation over and 
over. 

Thi s has been the rate of 
UCSD's wo men's lacrosse team 
th is season. Alt hough it can take 
solace in the fact that it isn' t alone 
(even indoor sport s have been 
affected by the wrath of EI Nino), 
that doesn't help much. 

So when the skies cl eared this 
weekend, a collecti ve sigh could be

In Friday 's contest, UCSD 
found itself in a Trojan war. This 
game was not going to easy by any 
means. 

However, with the amazing 
defensive play of Jennifer Silhavy. 
things were never out of control. 
OffL! nsively, att ackers Chri s Moll , 
Marissa Bell and Ange lique Bon-
ncr all chipped in scores. Si lhavy 
even got in on the act, as UCS D 
squeaked out a tough win . 

Satu rday, UCSD ran into tnost 
likely the league's toughest oppo-
nent. the Sun Devils o f ASU. 
Despite the great play of Kate 
Pabst, Joanne Lee and, of course, 
Silhavy, UCSD couldn 't pull off 
the big upset and dropped. the 
match to its hated rivals.

irst of all , let me di spel thi s

put it in the simplest terms, I

The UCSD Guardian Thursday, March 6, 199~ 

Although the 

Tritons we re 

severely tested 

by the hated Cal 

Lutheran Regals 

last night at 

RIMAe, UCSD 

won the war, 

62-56 and now 

mu. t get ready 

fo r a wintry 
second round in 

Minnesota 

That sa id . I think It might he 
the funni e!> t thing ever if I did 
enter. Apparently, we have two 
slales here: Sludents Fir~ 1 and 
l3 evo lution. Screw those guys, 
I' ll run under Illy own slale, 
ca lled Sport s hrst! 

It will be great. I' ll set up my 
very own campaign tahle on the 
Library Walk. I' ll ha ve a phal 
barbecue go ing, and just a 
bunch of sports equipment lay-
ing around for prospectiv ' vot -
ers to play with . Then, if you 
pledge your vote to me, you get 
to drink some of the "magic 
(vodka) juice." If you hring a 
friend, you get to drink from the 
goodness of the mysterious si 1-
vcr barrel under the table.

Rodman-esque: Sophomore forward Kate Turnbull (right) battles with Cal Lu's Missy Rider for a 
rebound in UCSD's 62-56 first round playoff win last night. Turnbull recorded a team-high 13 boards . 

My platform'! "UCSD sucks 
and I' m here to change it." 

My top priority will, of 
course, he our Iledgling sports 
program. I will divert alimonies 
from stupid crap like the Stuart 
Art Collection and the Med 
School and give it to a needy 
cause: our athletics program. 

I' m not going to make any 
Divi ion I promises. But hell , 
with all this money we will be 
the most well-funded Division 
II school in history. No more 
long bus rides - we' lIlly teams 
to L.A., just for the fun of it. 

As for the other presidential-
type stuff, I will make the most 
lavish promises ever. I don ' t 
care about boring stuff like if 
Women's Studies wants to 
change the name of its major -
do it, I don ' t give a Nagano. 

My attention will be focused 
on the next high-school super-
star to give illegal money to and 
the new ny-girl intern who 
wants to visit the presidential 
suite.

This weekend 's forecast for Cold Springs, 
Minnesota: high _1°C, low -8°C. In other 
words, it is going to be just a lillie cold, actual -
ly, technically, freezing. 

But who cares, right '? Minnesota is usually 
pretty damn cold thi s time of year, 
regardless of whether EI Niiio is or 
isn't wrecking havoc somewhere 
south of the equator. So what 's the 
big deal? 

The big deal is this: As a con-
sequence of its lirst-round victory 
over Cal Lutheran Wednesday 
night, the UCSD women's basket-
ball team is heading cast to the 
state of 10,000 lakes, all of which will probably 
be frozen . 

Perhaps the only thing chillier than the 
weather will be its opponent's reception. The 
College of St. Benedict awaits the Tritons, a 
team loaded with talent , and a team which is 
currently ranked No. 4 in the nation. 

"They're one of the best teams in the coun-
try," Krista Poehler adnowledged. "'n fact . 
they've been ranked No. I for much of the sea-
son." 

Despite the stature of the opponent, UCSD 
will be ready for aturday night. The women 
have known for quite some time that the road to 
the National Championship would go through 
Minnesota, and the Tritons are poised to pull 
otT the upset. 

"It 's go ing to he a hallie, hut we 've got noth -
ing 10 lose," Poehler ~aid . "I think we can win." 

The upcoming trip was made possihle by 
the Tritons ' 62-56 victory over the hated Regals 
last night. Playing in front of a larger-than-
average crowd at RIMAC Arena, the women 
recorded their 16th straight victory. 

Much more importantly, their 
23rd victory of the year enabled 
the team to continue it s postseason 
run , advancing SD to the sec-
ond rollnd of the NCAA Divison 
III Tourament. 

Wednesday 's victory essential -
ly amounted to a talc of two 
halves. The lirst was ex tremely 
good for the Tritons. The second, 

well , it was less than good. 
The Tritons came out firing, and by late in 

the half it appeared that they might simply bury 
Cal Lu. 

"We came out with spark, ready to go," 
Poehler said. "It was offensive, it was defen-
sive, it was everything." 

Early on, it was the inside game which 
paced the Tritons, and enabled the women to 
build a 5-point lead. Kate Turnbull and Sum-
mer Begley were huge, dominating the defen-
sive board and converting offensively. In total , 
the duo accounted for 12 of the Tritons' lirst 15 
points. 

Two timely substitutions by Head Coach 
Jlldy Malone initially proved to be too much 
for the Regals to handle. The first wa Marci 

Ernsherger, whose hustl e instantly caused con-
siderable havoc, resulting in a couple of uncon-
tested layups at the offensive end. 

The second was Amy McClure, who entered 
the game with UCSD up 23- 14. Propelled hy 
McClure's 7 consecutive points, the Tritons 
proceeded to go on a 9-0 run , pushing their 
advantage to 18. 

But just when it appeared that the- Tritons 
mi ght he on their way to another lops ided vic-
tory, Cal Lu regrouped. The Regals played 
UCSD even for the remainder of the half, sal-
vaging a 38-2 1 halftime score. 

The second half in no way resembled the 
lirst. In contrast to the Iluid play of the first 
half, the second was ragged and tenuous. The 
culprit was defense, as both teams, in particular 
Cal Lu, stepped it up on their own end of the 
court . 

The physical defensive play of the Regals 
limited the Tritons to just four buckets in the 
second half, resulting in 22 percent shooting. 

Slowly, almost exasperatingly, the Regals 
cut into UCSD's lead. The advantage was 18 
with six minutes gone, 9 seven minutes later, 
and a mere 6 with three-and-a-half to play. 

Fortunately for UCSD's travel plans, the 
Regal rally eventually fell short . 

As for this weekend, the plane for Minneso-
ta leaves from Lindberg Field at 6 a.m. on Fri -
day morning. The Tritons are ready for the trip, 
ready for the cold, and ready for St. Benedict. 

Can the Tritons slay the giant? 
"Yes, absolutely," Turnbull said.
