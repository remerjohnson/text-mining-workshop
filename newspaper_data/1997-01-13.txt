Sexual-Harassment Policy in Question 
CHARGES: Terpstra 
claims administration 
is 'blocking' her work 
By Rebekah Michelson 
Staff Writer 

Although UCSD Oftice of Sexual 
Harassment Prevention and Policy 
(S HPP) Director June Terpstra 
claims redundant university poli -
cies are hindering her efforts to pro-
tect victims of sexual harassment, 
administrators claim accusations are 
current ly investigated as fast as pos-

sible. 
According to Terpstra. sexual 

harassment charges can be settled in 
one of two ways: informally. where 
the issue is resolved quietly between 
a handful of people; and formally . in 
which case the SHPP office con-
ducts an official investigation into 
the charge and recommends sanc-
tions to the appropriate vice chan-
cellor. 

"We have no problem gelling 
cases informally resolved."Terp tra 
said. 

However. Terp tra said formal 

investigations often lead to conflicts 
with campus administrators. 

"In a nutshell , the administration 
i . blocking the procedures," Terpstra 
said, "It 's a matter of overlapping 
policy." 

If the resulls of an SHPP prelimi-
nary investigation support the origi-
nal charge. current campus policy 
dictate that the appropriate vice 
chancellor be notified. 

Terpstra said ideally the vice 
chancellor wou ld then forward the 
case to the appropriate campus of-
fice for disciplinary proceedings. 

For example. an undergraduate 
student accused of sexual harass-
ment would first be investigated by 
the SHPP office. If Terpstra deter-
mined there was sufficient evidence 
to support the claim, the case would 
be referred to the vice chancellor of 
student affairs. The vice chancellor 
would then send the case to the 
Student Conduct Coordinator for 
action. 

Graduate students accused of 
harassment would be proce sed by 
the Office of Graduate Studies and

I Eat Dining 

FOOD: Plaza Cafe to change 
January 26 to meal-plan dollars, 
TOQ to reopen in spring 
By YH..e1 Yang 
Staff Writer 

As of the end of January , UCSD's last all-
you-can-eat dining hall - Revelle College's 
Plaza Cafe- will convert to full -time a fa carte 
service. 

Muir 's Top of the Quad cafeteria will also be 
a fa carte when renovations are completed in the 
spring. 

Currently. the Plaza Cafe offers a La carte-
menu-based - dining weekdays for breakfast 

and lunch, and all-you-can-eat dining fordinner 
seven days a week and weekend brunch. 

Starting Sunday, Jan. 26. the Plaza Cafe will 
be open for a fa carte dining weekdays from 
7: 15 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., and from 10:30 a.m. to 
7:30 p.m. on weekends and holidays. 

"The staff at Plaza Cafe will be a lot happier 
with the transition to complete a /(1 carte dining 
service." said Jae Henderson. Revelle senior 
and Plaza Cafe student supervisor. "It will be 
easier on the staff since they will no longer have 
to change from all-you-can-eat dining to a /a 
carte during the week." 

Because only 36 students still have meal 
plans that restricts them to all-you-can-eat din-
i ng, Muir Resident Dean Pat Danylyshyn-Adams

I .. UCSD Awarded $300K Grant for Cancer-Outreach Project 
I 
I HEALTH: Project aims 

to infonn black women 
about breast cancer 
By Elaine Johnson 
Staff Writer 

The Bristol -Myers Squihb Foun-
dation recently awarded the U SD 
Cancer Center a $300.000 grant to 
fund a health-education program tar-
geting African-American women. 

The B lack Beauticians Health 
Promotion Program will focus on 
African-American women in San 
Diego County. emphasiLing the im-

portance of breast cancer scrcening 
and other health-related issues. 

The initial study was funded hy 
grants from the UCSD Academic 
Senate, the San Diego Community 
Foundation - which provides grants 
for charitable purposes in a specific 
community - and the San Diego 
County Medical Society Alliance. 

"By being a leader in promoting 
and increasi ng responsible and ef-
fective philanthropy. we can make 
an impact on the quality of life of 
our San Diego communities," San 
Diego Community Foundation 
President and CEO Bob Kell y 'iaid. 

African-Americans compri esix 
percent of San DiegoCounty 's popu-
lation. and studies have shown that 
African-American women have a 
higher risk for developing breast 
ca nce r than women of other 
ethnicities. 

Georgia Robins Sadler, the 
center's associate direclor of out-
reach and prinCipal inve tigator of 
the program. says beauticians will 
be effective in rclaying the informa-
tion because "the relationship be-
tween African-American women 
and Iheirbeauticians i trusting and 
rcspectful." 

Beauticians in the targeted com-
munities will be trained in effective 
of outreach in situations where tra-
ditional methods of communicalion 
about health issues have been inad-
equate. 

"Il was cont:eivable that by con-
veying key information through the 

. familiar methodsof storytelling and 
witne si ng. black women could be-
come motivated 10 follow annual 
breast-cancer screening guidelines." 
Sadler said.

thc notion that the udministration i

However. Terpstra says the added

with sexual-harassmclll complailll 
in a reasonable manner. 

"Cases are not being responded

Terpstra said she is al 0 con-

"There is a conservative streak

Terpstra amibuted thi s attitude

Slashing Welfare Programs 
W hile Not Creating New Jobs 

Eliminates the Chance for 
Disadvantaged People to Start Over 

By ........ F. 1k 
Staff WfIler 

I am not like 11l0~t people who have 
debaled the i~sue of welfare reform. I have 
been direclly affected by welfare - because 
I wa~ on it. Thi~ i~ not something I easi ly 
divulge. for fear of stigmati/.ation. 

There really is no reason why I should 
feel ashamed about my past. ~y parents 
were living in Ihe slums of Philadelphia. had 
recently dropped out of college, and were 
trying 10 support a family. Rea lizing they 
wanted a beller life for both themselves and 
me. tbey went on welfare and returned to 
school. 

My earliest chi Idhood memories are of 
hanu-me-down clothing from my older 
cousin Josh. and the ear we called the "ghet-
to sled" in which you could see the road 
from the holes in the floorhoards. Today. my 
parenls are bulh employed and successful in 
Iheir jobs. 

Howcver. the new welfare reform law 
Pres ident ClinlOn signed in August will 
make success siories such as mine thing~ of 
the past. II will C'lp the length of time an 
individual can receive state aid, it will give 
~tates more discretion through the impl'-
mentation of block grants. and 11 will 
~Iash funding for all welfare programs. 
m 'Iuding the food-stamp program . 

Children will he hit hardest by the 
recent welfare refollll because they 
compnse the single largesl group 
receiving we lfare benelits. A new-
borl\ chi ld whose parents are on 
welfare will usc up her lifelime 
welfare eligibility by the time she 
IS live years old, placing her at 
risk of starvation. 

The new welfare reform will 
furce many mothers to seck 
employment. as most single par-
ents on wei fare arc women. 
Quality daycare i ' limited and 
very expen~ive . Many women are 
unable to afford day care. evcn 
while holding a full -time job. 
Additionally, the law will end the 
guaranlee that child care will be pro-
vided for women on welfare participat-
ing in work or job training and for fami -
lies at risk. 

The prevalent belief that people on wel -
fare are laLY and choose nOI to work i a 
myth. Currently there is a job shortage in 
California. With the large number of people 
forced off welfare and into the work-force. 
an even more desperate situation will be cre-
ated. 

tate unemployment currently rests at 
seven percent, and mo t oflhe I million pco-

pie looking for work are not on welfare. 
Nearly 500.000 part-time employees wou ld 
like to work more hours. Due to Ca lifornia'~ 
recovering economy, state employment fore-
caMer~ predict that 300,()()() new jobs will he 
created a year. However. the current rate of 
job growth remains at it lowest rate since 
the Great Depression. 

Nol only does the welfare refom bill not 
include the creation of new jobs, it di scon-
tinues a federal program - JOBS - that 
provided work and training for welfare 
recipients. People kicked off aid must either 
si nk or ~wim. and many of them will sink. 

To make matters worse. Governor Wi Ison 
has announced state welfare

Giving States the Power to Create 
Their Own Welfare Programs 

Will Save Money While Helping 
Those Who Deserve It Most 

By Chris Sclwelber 
Editor In Chief 

When an automobile breaks down. the 
first thing one Iries to do is repair it. As it con-
tinually fails to perfonn and belches out 
thick, black clouds of poisonous gas. one 
begins to lose patience, but most of us till 
might apply even greater efforts to salvage 
thc old heap. 

However. when the "machine" is up on 
cement blocks in the front lawn with weeds 
growing up through the noor panels and a 
fami ly of squirrels living in the engine block, 
it's time to junk thai loathsome bucket of 
bolts and begin anew. 

This was exactly the problem 
that faced the federal 

government as they looked to overhaul the 
welfare system during the pa t two years. 
President Clinton, being from Arkansas. 
resisted Congress' first two elTorts to remove 
the dilapidated eye ore from our nation's 
front lawn - after all, hi neighbors all had ' 
them when he was growing up. They were 
considered sophisticated art in the Deep 
South, like lawn namingos and velvet Elvis 
wall hangings. 

Eventually. even good 01' boy Bubba 
relented, belatedly agreeing last August to 
revolutioni1.A: and revitalize America by act-
ing on hi s 1992 campaign promise to "end 
welfare as we know it." Congress passed and 
Clinton signed into law a bill that ended a 61 -
year federal guarantee of aid to the poor - a 
system greatly expanded by President 
Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s and one that 
has ever since been dragging America ever 
dceper into fiscal and moral quagmire. 

The federal government has finally decid-
ed to recognize the existence of the 10th 
Amendment to Ihe Constitution. at least in 
this limited area, and let the state construct 
their own welfare programs. This is a markcd 

improvement over the old system. which 
tried to make the square and triangular 

problems of all the states fit into the 
same round holes of federal standards 
and regulations. 

The new law has three main goals. 
each of which is designed to address 
a glaring flaw in the old system. The 
first is to pot an end to the 61-year 
failure of the federal government 
to improve Ihe financial circum-

tances of America 's poor by 
granting states the autonomy to 
create local relief systems. 

The second is to create a link 
between welfare benefits and 
work. so as to end the phenome-
non of multiple generations of 
people spending their entire lives 

on the federal dole. 
Third, and not necessarily last. is 

to save money by cracking down on 
abused programs and using money 

more efficiently. 
Under the old. nawed federal sys-

tem. slates on the Mexican border with 
large populations of illegal-immigrant 

workers, such as California and Texas. were 
treated 'as if they had c)(actly the same prob-
lems in terms of welfare expenses and distri-
bution as did midwestern states with their 
'sagging industrial bases. 

Individual state are more capabIC of 
crafting plans suited to their unique econom-
ic and social needs than is the federal gov-

COMMENTARY: Even though Newt Gingrich was re-elected last week to an office he previously tried to 
keep clean, two incidents from his past threaten to weaken both the office of speaker and his own politcal future 

SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE ACTED CARELESSLY 
ByRy_ OIson 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

It is amazing how quickly the 
tide of political 'candal has 
changed. For the past four years the 
Republicans have tried their best to 
catch Bill Clinton doing something 
wrong. How ironic it is to 'ee one of 
the Republicans' o wn leaders 
caught with his hand in the cookie 
jar. 

A recent investigation by a 
House ethics subcommittee found 
that Speaker of the House Newt 
Gingrich may have misused tax-
exempt fund for political purposes 
and "misled" the subcommittee in 
its investigation of one of the 
numerous complaints liled against 
him. 

His problems began when he 
served as House minority whip and 
chairnlan of the chief fundraising 
organization of the Republican 
Party. GOPAC. It appears that 
Gingrich may have used non-profit. 
tax-exempt organizations to 
advance the agenda of the 
Republican Party. The first alleged 
violation occurred in 1990. when 
GO PAC used a tax-exempt organi-
l.ation. with Gingrich 's knowledge 
and approval, to fund one of 
GOPAC's programs. 

The second case involves a col-
lege course Gingrich taught . funded 
by tax-exempt organilUtions. 
Documents. including letters. 
memos and transcnpts of discus-
sions made by Gingnch. prove that 

. Gingrich used the course for politi-
cal purposes by selling recordings of 
his lectures and other elas materials 
as a pan of GOPAC's fundraising. 

The Internal Revenue Code 
clearl y states that tax -exempt orga-
nizations cannot participate in polit-
ical activities or provide support to 
political action committees such as 
GOPAC. 

While the Ethic subcommittee 
did not find any vio lation of the 
Internal Revenue Code. it did report 
that Gingrich should have sought 
legal counsel to investigate the pro-
priety of using tax-exempt funds for 
such purposes. 

During the investigation into this 
matter by the Ethics subcommittee. 
however, Gingrich commilled an 
error more serious than mere abuse 
of tax-exempt organizations. 
Gingrich misled the subcommillec 
by submitting. through his lawyer. 
several documents that claimed that 
GO PAC had no involvement in the 
development and management of 
the courses he taught. 

This elaim was disproved via a 
bevy of memos, documents. conver-
sations and interviews that directly 
linked the course to GOPAC. For 
this acl of misleading the subcom-
mittee. Gingrich was found to have 
not conducted himself "m a manner 
which shall renect credibi lity on the 
House of Representat i ves." 

Last month. Gingrich accepled 
the linding of the House Ethil:S 
Investigative Subcommittee that he 

Gingrich must rea"ze 
that "'public office I. 
a public trust" and 
begin to act 
responsibly. 
should have sought legal advice 
about funding a college class that he 
taught. In addition. Gingrich admit-
ted that he provided inaccumte and 
misleading information to the sub-
committee. This admi SSion has hurt 
Gingrich's already tarnished reputa-
lion. 

For the subcommi ttee to say Ihut 
Gingrich should merely have sat 
down and thought Ihis violation out 
before he ac ted is to flout the law 
that the commiltee is suprxlsed to he 
upholding. The law clcarly stales 
Ihat tax-I!xempl organi/atiol1~ arc 
not allowcu to lak!: auvanlage of 
Iheir status by suprxlntng a rOlitical 
party. 

Gingrich did tn fact vlolme the 

tax code numerous times and should 
be held accountable for his aClions. 
even if he was not aware of his 
transgressions. 

It is also very hard 10 accept that 
an ethics commillee considers it 
acc<.!ptable for Gingril:h to use a 
publil:ly funded college course for 
the primary purpose of promoting 
Republican idl'1ls. The people who 
sal in Gingrich's classes were unwit-
ting pawns in this shameless allempl 
to promote the Republican pany at 
the public's expense. 

The argumenl made by Gingrich 
Ihat the course was non-partisan 
docs not hold water. GOPAC had an 
instrumental part in the develop-
ment and the management of the 
coursc. For example. the name of 
the course. " Renewing American 
CiviliLalion," i~ Ihe same as a polit-
ical group that Gingrich founded 
(and GOPAC supported). In fact. 
documents and statements made by 
Gingrich cite the class as an integrJI 
part ofa plan to obtain l:ontrol oflhe 
House of Representati vcs from Ihe 
D<.!mocrat~ and "make the guvern-
ment accountable again." 

Whcn the d()(Umenb submilled 
by Gingnl:h to the subcolllmittee 
turned out to he erroneous. Gingrich 
blamed 1m lawyer. who reSigned in 
anger. G111gnch then t ned to dl~l11i~~ 
Ihe siluation as an ovep,ight. 

Gingrich '~ detractors accuse 
hllll of lying, while his ~upp()rtep, 
d;um that It wa~ a ~IIlIP1c rnistake. 
Considering that the latter pw,slhill -

ty may be true. his supporters must 
think that Gingrich is either very 
stupid or did not read the documents 
he lilcd with the commillce. 
According to the report published 
by the suhcommittee. Gingrich 
reviewed and signed Ihe submis-
sions before hi s lawyer presenled 
them to the committee. 

It 's possible that Gingrich "acci-
dentally" skipped over the parts that 
"misled" the subcol11111itlee. 
However. it sel!ms much more like-
ly that Gingrich made those state-
ments not thinking that they would 
be hannful if discovered, and later 
tried to salvage the siluation by 
blaming his legal counsel. 

Gingrich. after a solid slart with 
the "Contract With Amcrica." has 
linally had his past catch up 10 him. 
The Ethics Committee must decide 
what punishment to givc Gingrich. 
At the very least, it should be a let-
ter of reprimand from the commil-
tee. At the llIost, il should he a call 
to the House to prescribe punish-
ment. 

In a sense. all Ihis is JlOClie jus-
ticl! for ewl Gi ngrich. In the 
InO's, Gmgnch was ~uccessful in

In Californi a, the Connell

that teenage mothers live with their 
parents to receive benefit. Tho e 
girls for whom living at home is not 
an option will be left without food 
or shelter. As more teenage mothers 
find themselves in desperate situa-
ti ons, incidents such as the recent 

ew Jersey debacle in which two 
teenager killed their newborn child 
may become more common. 

The Relocation Grant will 
re trict recipients from receiving a 
welfare payment higher than one 
received from their previous stale 
for 12 months after a move. As 
California's cost of living is higher 
than most other states in the nation,

incentives for companies that create 
Job opponunitie for welfare reci pi-
cnts. 

The first is to offer tax credits to 
companies that hire people on wel-
fare. Connell al,o suggested offer-
ing companies who post fiscal-year 

l os~es a smaller cash sum instead of 
the tax credit. 

Additionally, Connell wants to 
gi ve companies that incurred a tax 
liability les~ than the federal maxi -
mum per worker the option of usi ng 
their tax credit either three years 
prior to or 15 years after the year in 
which the liability was incurred. 

These kinds of ideas would give

Monday, January 13. 1997 

cism of pre-reform welfare is that it 
was inadequate. Welfare recipients 
received too little money and were 
thus unable to break out of lhe 
vicious cycle of poverty. The gov-
ernment needs to provide enough 
money for people to afford child 
care, enough money for people to 
find a job (including money to relo-
cate ) and enough money to finance 
continued education and job train-
ing. 

Enough money would finall y 
make welfare what it was meant to 
be: a temporary, viable assistance 
program to help people get back on 
their feel. Unti I we recognize that 
the new welfare is a poor substitute 
for a programs based on these prin-
ci ples, both the poor and the tax-
payers will inevitably suffer. 

because the government has effec-
tively lowered the costs companies 
incur in turning these types of work-
ers into productive members of the 
work fo rce. 

And, lest one becomes disheart-
ened because of the belief that wel-
fare bureaucrats have no motivation 
to move people off of the roles, as 
had heen the case in the past, 
Congres was one tep ahead of this 
problem. A provision of the bill cut ~ 
state ' wei fare funds by fi ve percent 
if at least 25 percent of their welfare 
roles aren 't employed in the next 
year. 

Somehow, I think the welfare 
bureaucrats will manage to find 
gai nful employment for these folk s. 
It 's just a gues" but it 's the bureau-
crats own money (in a fashion) on 
the line this time, instead of just the 
average taxpay(;r' s.

Continued from page 1 
said the conversion to complete a/a 
carre dining at both the Plaza Cafe 
and Top of the Quad was intended to 
accommodate the most students. 

"We are trying to provide the 
best se rvice for students and thei r 
sc hedules," Danylyshyn-Adams 
sa id ... It 's difficult to accept. but 
time arc changing." 

According to Assistant Housing 
And Dining Services Director Brian 
Klippel. Top of the Quad is In its 
final des ign stage. The redesigned 
restaurant will probably bcar a dif-
ferent name to renect it s new image. 

"We arc hoping for construction 
to begin in February and for it to be 
completed in the spring of this year." 
Klippel said. "However. there is no 
contractor on board yet, so it wi II be 
difficult for the job to be done in 
only three months . 

Begi nning the same day. all meal 
plans will switch to the "meal-plan 
dollar" system - also known as the 
"point system." The 700 meal-plan 
dollar and 800 meal-plan dollar per 
quarter options will sti ll be orfered. 
However the 80 meals with 300 meal ' 
plan dollars per quarter and 65 meals 
with 300 meal plan dollars per quarter 
plans will both be eliminated. 

According to Kli ppel. stude nts 
or their parents can add money to 
the 700 or 800 dollar plans at any 
time. However. Klippel said a meal 
plan with fewer than 700 doll ars 
would not be offered. As always. 
meal-plan dollars expire at the end 
of each quarter and unused meal-
plan dollars are not refundable. 

" I think complete a fa carte din-
ing is a good idea because it allows 
you the freedom to eat whenever. of 
however much, yo u want ," Muir 
fres hman Scan Edgett sa id. 

wdenl s living in the residence 
halls wi II all be affected by the 
change because they arc all required .

"It 's going to be grealthat Plaza

be offering complete a fa carte din-
ing se rvice," Rathskellar worker 
Jenell Darcy said. "Students will 
now be offered more choices and a 
more varied food selection."

8 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, January I 3, 1997 

GUARDIAN PHOTO SLANDERED UCSD MECHA 
Editor: 

As a member or the UCSD 
Chicano community and rormer fac -
ulty advisor to our campus MEChA, 
I am dismayed that the Guardian 
has engaged once again in the worst 
kind of yellow journalism. The 
phOlO on the r ront page of your Dec. 
2, 19%, issue show fOur students in 
the act of burning an American nag. 
What the caption docs not make 
clear is that none of the individuals 
pictured is a UCSD student. TIle 
implication that the nag-burning 
was pcrpetratcd by mcmbers of 
UCSD MEChA is provocative and 
sensationalistic at best. This mis-
leading photo and commentary on 
the cover or our campus newspaper 
dl~I()f1S the historical record and fur-
Iher exacerbate~ Ihe ho~ti\C climate 
rclt by many sludenl~ of color. 

The Guardian owes an apology 
to U SD Mechi~ta~ who ~tudy and 

work hard every day in order to 
complete their education and in the 
process win some modicum of fair 
representation for people or 
Me}(ican descent. 

Jorge Mariscal 
Associate Professor of 

Literature 

Editor:r NOIe: While the IJOint 
aboUl our vague caption is well 
taken. we think Iilal members of 
UCSD MEChA callnOI expecl 10 
evade associalion with the aClions 
of Iheir cohorts from olher schools.

the misllnderstandillg.

6, 1997). This stems largely from 
the fact that the American flag rep-: 
resents so many things: America 
itself, American ideal , American 
policies of all kinds, the American 
government, the American 
President. Which of these things is a 
person add res ing when he bums 
the nag? I personally think it was 
done more ror sensationalism than 
anything else in the case of the 
MEChA members. 

I disagree with Pietila's state-
ment that the nag is "our mo t 
important national symbol." While 
the nag is easily the most recogniz-
able symbol of America and all that 
it stands for, the truly most impor-
lant symbol of thi s great nation is 
the onslilution .... When the presi -
dent takes the oath or office at his 
inauguration. he swears 10 protect 
not the American nag. but the 
American Constitution: a document

whose first amendment effectively 
states that bad taste is not a crime .... 

Pietila also said that "nag burn-
ing is nothing more than the politi-
cal equivalent of vernally assaulting 
one's neighbor." I agree. in both 
cases, the assaulted party gets his 
fcclings hurt , but no physical dam-
age is done. In both cases. the 
assaulted party has three options: 
ignore the insult, try to reason things 
out with the other party, or use more 
c}(treme measures to si lencc them. 
The first two are by far more rea-
sonable courses of action. The third 
seems very immature to me. 

I agree that flag burning is in bad 
taste. and it personally disgust , me. 
But I am proud to live in a country 
that lets people do things that may 
be disagreeable to others. It 's demo-
cratic value like this that made our 
country great.

POLICY: 
Harassment has 'a 
different set of rules' 
Continued from pc. 3 

Terpstra said she believes she 
was brought to UCSD because of 
her extensi~e t'xperience in the field 
of sexual-assault prevention. She 
aid she has made repeated efforts 

to amend programs and policies 
which she felt are not performing as 
well as they shou ld have been. 

She received her undergraduate 
and graduate degrees in women 's 

studies fro m Governor's State. an 
Illinois state school. She also at-
tended Harvard and the University 
of Chicago. Terpstra has lectured at 
Northwestern University an d 
UCSD. 

She began her career in sexual-
assault prevention in 1978, and 
founded a women's shelter in 1982 
and an abused chi ldren's shelter in 
1984. Terpstra created the women' s 
cenler at Northwestern University 
in 1986, and came to work at UCSD 
in 1993. Terpstra established the 
SHPP office four years ago. 

Tcrp tra, who said she feels there

is a "distrust or the office itself." 
added that she needs the 
administration'S assistance to suc-
cessfully fulfill her responsibilities 
as SHPP office director. 

"I have to feel like I have their 
absolute support and that they trust 
their officers." Terpstra said. 

The issue of sexual harassment. 
according to Terpstra and Attiyeh. 
is one that requires attention and 
care. 

"Se}(ual harassment has a dif-
ferent set of rules," Terpstra said. 
"We have to educate ourse lves 
about what - legally and socia lly 
- should be done."

. EQlrts II_basile ,llllilllS l.alS If allnilUl1 stress 
The life of a college tudent 

is not an easy one. The 
combination of pressures to 
attain academic, financial, 
occupational and personal 
success make stress an 
inevitable function of a UCSD 
student's daily life. 
What Is stress? 

Psychologists define stress 
as a psycho-physiological 
(mind-and-body) arousal that 
can fatigue body systems to the 
point of malfunction and 
disease. 

However, stress is not 
necessarily bad . According to 
UCSD assislant professor of 
psychology Nicholas 
Christenfcld, there are two 
types of stress. 

Positive stres~ .. - also called 
eustress - allows an individual 
to do such things as take an 
eJl.am or drive on the freeway, 
whereas negative stress - also 
known as distress - keeps an 
individual from being 
productive, Christenfeld said. 

"Optimal stress [which lies 
somewhere between eustress 

and distress] keeps the person 
functioning well and doe not 
interfere with acti vities," 
Christenfeld said. 

"Stress is negative when it 
eJl.ceeds our ability to cope, 
fatigues our body sy terns and 
causes behavioral problems," 
said Richard Schulte, professor 
of psychology al San Diego 
State University. "Stress is 
positive when it forces us to 
adapt." 

According to Schulte, stress 
is determined by either an 
intemal or external framework, 
and varies individually. 

" Stress is that whi ch i s 
perceived by the individual as 
that which causes [him or her) 
to feel under pressure or 
tension," he said. "What one 
may feel as stress, another may 
not." 

Stress is defined in terms of 
tolerance. EJl.perts say that 
stress is created by an 
imbalance between demand 
and the capacity to meet that 
demand. Thus, tressful 
environments are considered to 

be those outside the normal 
tolerance limits o f daily 
function. 

Recent sludies show that 
stress is nol an inherent quality 
of eJl.ternal circumstances, 
however. 

In their Wellness for Life 
Workbook, Thomas and Dianne 
Murphy call stress "a response 
to your ci rcumstances which 
takes place inside of you, and is 
th erefore subject to your 
personal control." 

Experts say the goal is to 
manage stress by diminishing 
"excess" stress - the stress 
extraneous to the successful 
accomplishment of objectives. 
Effects of str .. s 

The dealh of a loved one, 
financial concerns, academic 
activities, occupational goals, 
the experience of 
discrimination, homesickness 
and interpersonal relationships 
are some cumples of major 
psycho-social causes of stress. 

Studies show that untreated 
stress can lead 10 more serious

UCSD student 

Experts say that whether stress 
will escalate into something more 
serious depends on the severity and 
duration of the stress. as well as the 
individual 's ability to cope. 

Early physiological effects of 
unrelieved stress include 
headaches. sleeplessness. lower 
back pain, anxiety, irritability, 
mental di sorientation, high blood 
pressure, ga trointestinal disorders. 
smoking, alcohol and drug abuse. 

Long term effects include heart 
disease, strokes, cancer, ulcers and 
obesity. 

"People need to control stress 
with professional help, as opposed 
to self-medication," Schulte said. 
"Often. stress becomes so

like alcohol and drugs." 
Studies show that stress affects 

se lf-image and self-awarenes , 
focus of attention, interpretation 
and judgment of events, attention 
and knowledge transfer. 

According to a 1994 study by 
Shirley Fisher. profe sor of 
psychology at the University of 
StrathcJyde in Glasgow, Scotland, 
individuals who have difficulty 
concentrating may miss critical 
aspects of the content of lectures or 
misread texts and exam questions. 
Copl", with stress 

Experts define stress 
management as the ability to 
reduce st ress arou a I or to cope ina 
competent manner with the source 
of the stress. 

"Stress tends to place you in a 
reactive relation hip to your 

circumstances, while effective 
tress management puts you in 

control of yourself with re peet to 
your circumstances," Murphy and 
Murphy say. 

Studies show that the perception 
of low personal control can create 
as well as exacerbate stress. 

"It is useful to look at your life," 
Schulte said. "What are the stresses 
to do something about? What are 
the little stresses? Which are the 
ones you've manufactured? 
Effectively dealing with tress is in 
the way you think about it - what 
i the cause of the problem, what 
are the i neon veniences?" 

There are two main approaches 
to coping with stress. The first is 
problem-focused coping, which is 
a way of achieving control over the 
problem and involves an analysi

of the main sources of difficulty to 
see whether changes are possible. 

The second approach is 
emotion-focused. This strategy is 
to be applied when the problem 
cannot be solved, so the person 
suffering distress is encouraged to 
try to reduce the emotional trauma. 

. Emotion-focusing coping 
strategies assume that the problem 
remains stressful and that the 
individual must find the means to 
prevent damage. 

Christenfeld recommends that. 
to cope with stress. students engage 
in physical exercise and consult a 
trusted friend or a counselor to 
bring thoughts and feelings out into

Does your tummy hurt? Well maybe 

it's teUing you to take it to Club Me<! to 
fill it up with all s~rts of yurnmies! The 
last time Bob and I went there for lunch I 

had a Krazy Krab sandwich, Club Meet's specialty. The 
nice young man at the deli sandwich counter piled lots 
of alfalfa sprouts, lettuce, and tomatoes with the Krazy 
Krab on top of soft wheat bread. It was Krazy! I splurged 
and topped off my tasty sandwich with a nice cold dish 
of chocolate pudding, that's made fresh daily. Bob had 
one of Club Med's famous juicy hamburgers with 
mushrooms and onions, crispy golden French fries. and 
a giant chocolate chip cookie. Boy was he pleased! He 
was drooling allover himself! When Bob found out that 
Club Med has a different specialty hamburger every day, 
he nearly burst with joy! Club Mcd has a Rice Pail of 
the Day, toO, including dclectible dishes like lemon 
chicken and beef broccoli. And now Club Mcd is also 
open Monday through Thursday, 8- \\ p.m.,

Club Med is open to make it feel better.

STRESS: 
Procrastination major 
source of stress 
Continued from p8&e 12 
in alleviating stress. 

"[Perhaps) with the help of a 
profes ional counselor, the 
individual need to look at the way 
he/she thinks," Schulte said. "Are 
there any negative cognitions" 
Why do they place emphasis on 
negative. not positive things? This 
kind of cognitive restructuring will 
keep the person from creating more 
stress for himlherself." 

Psychologists recommend three 
basic strategies to break the hold of 
chronic stress: the regular practice 
of con 'cious relaxation. 
continuous maintenance of clarity 
and personal organization and the 
exercise of positive altitude 
control. 

Studies show that conscious 
relaxation ha stress-reducing 
cffects that cannot be provided by 
simply sitting quietly or even by 
sleeping. 

"Your body waits to be told that 
it is okay to relax; otherwise. it may 
faithfully hold itself in a state of 
perpetual reJdi ness, regardless of 
what you may be doing. " Murphy 
and Murphy say. "Stress inclines 
you to breathe in short. shallow 
breaths, whereas deep breathing 
provides you with maximum 
oxygen and virtually forces you to 
relax." 
Start planning now 

Experts also emphasize the 
imponance of planning ahead to 
avoid procrastinati on. an inevitable 
cause of stress. 

"Once students schedule and 
tructure their lives for the [school 

terml . they will see thai they have 
many hours, if they don't goof ofr." 
Schulte said. "If they start early 
enough , they can avoid stress. 
St udents put things off too long and 
create their own stress. My advice 
is mainly common sen e. The 
problem is constant application and 
practi(;c." 

In goal- eUing and action · 
planning, it is important to be 
realistic as well as idealistic. 
experts say. 

"The purpose of goal -setting is 
to determine where you are going, 
whereas the purpose of planning 
is to set a suitable course of 
gelling there," say Murphy and 
Murphy. 

Stress management means 
taking care of oneself - not in an 
impatient, critical. punitive sense. 
but in a caring. yet firmly 
det~rmine<f sense.

Santa Barbara Reveals 'Facts of ute' 
NO ToonE: Playing against top Division I competition, UCSD gained invaluable lessons at the UC Santa Barbara Invitational 
By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

Throughout the I 980s, TV view-
ers were inundated wi th a huge num-
ber of comy, t:arhon-copy programs 

In which one of the 
main characters was 
fat:ed with ce rtain 
troubles that would be 
rc~o l ved in the course 
of the half-hour time 
period. One of the e 
l> hows started with the 
Immortal line, "You 

take the good, YOlilak.e the bad, you 
take them both and there you have the 
facLS of life." 

While il took a little longer than a 
half-bour minus the commercials,the 
UCSD mcn ' ~ volleyball team got a 
chance to take a look at the good and 
the bad during its stay at the UC Santa 
Barbara Invitational. 

The volleyball classic, now in iLS 
33rd year of competition, featured 24 
of the lOp teams in the nation from 
Di visions I. U and J]] , as well as 
college d ub quads. Included in the 
fi eld were perennial national power-
houses UCLA, BYU, Stanford and 
the bosting Gouchos. 

While only coming away with a 
pair 01 vi tories in seven matches 
during their two-day stay, the Tritons 
wcre ahleto lcam what improvements 
need to be made to succeed against the 
best the country has to offer. 

" rhe good part was that we leamed 
a lot about ourselves," Triton Head 
Coach Duncan McFarland said. "We 

got in a lot of competition and we 
were able toplay everyone and look at 
a number of di fferent combinations, 
which we very much needed to do at 
this poin! in the season. The bad part 
was that we expected to wi n a little bit 
more than we did." 

On Friday, the fi rst day of the 
toumament, the Tritons arri ved at the 
gym at 8 a.m. for their first match 
again t the Uni vers ity of Indiana-
Purdue at Fort Wayne, and did not 
leave until 10:30 p.m. after playing 
five matches. The toumament fea-
tured a fonnat in which a team mu t 
win two of three games to take the 
match. 

In a competiti ve fi rst match agai nst 
Fort Wayne, UCSD played tough 
against a larger Oi vision I squad be-
fore fall ing, 15·9 and 15-9. 

The second match pitted the Tri-
tons agai nst the Aggies of UC Da vis. 
UCSD had to face some of the bad in 
the first game, as they squandered a 
14- 10 lead and were held at match 
poinl before the Aggies rallied back 
and won the game, 16- 14. After the 
tough loss, the Tritons were unable to 
rally any momentum for the second 
game and lost, 15-7. 

aged long, however, as they played 
one of their best matches of the tour-
nament again t powerhouse BYU. 
Coming off two tough losses, UCSO 
was thinking upset. 

In the fi rst game, the Tritons played 
inspired volleyball against the peren-
nial top 10 Cougars. After the 15-6 
win, UCSD continued to battle, but 
was overmatched and dropped the 
next two games and the match. 

Against the club team from UC 
Berkeley, the Tritons were the vic-
tims of some bad luck. A questionable 
call in the third game by the referee 
cost UCSD the winning point, allow-
ing Berkeley to rally and eventually 
wi n the match. 

A win over Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo closed the day of competition 
and sent the Tritons into the second 
day with renewed confidence. 

Thatconfidence was bruised when 
UCSD opened play on Saturday with 
a loss to the club team from Sacra-
mento State. 

"AI that point our pirits were sort 
of down because of the number of 
matches we had lost," McFarland said. 
"I felt that one of the characteristics 
that this team had to ha ve was to be 
very tough mentally - we could not 
let down and there eou Id be no giving 
up on this team." 

"To win that first game would 
have given us some good confidence 
because they were a good team," 
McFarland said. "We losta little bit of 
heart and lost the next one. That sort of 
discouraged the team because they 
felt like that was going to be one of the 
easier teams we were going to sec." 

The squad responded to the meet-
ing by wi nning its final match against 
Westmont in two slrdight games. in-
cluding a 15-0 shutoul. Tap: UCSD opposite hitter Doug McLeod (4 ) reaches for a dink. 

The Tritons did not stay discour-
In their travels to Santa Barbara, 

the Tri tons got to take a look at their 
own . 'Facts of Life" without having to 
wear any neon at all. Now when you 

take the good and tak.e the bad, you get 
UCSD volleyball.

Poets are Left at a Loss for Words 
DOUBLED UP: Outrebounding Whittier College 62 to 36, UCSD notched its 11 th victory 
By Travis Nil 
Staff Writer 

"Doing the Bull Dance, feeling the flow." 
This quOlC by Kevin Nealon in Adam 

Sandler's hit movie "Happy Gilmore" was 
describing Happy when he was 
playing amazing golf. He was 
in a rhythm, in the zone, some 
might even say, enfuego. 

Anyone who has played 
competiti ve sports knows what 
this feeling is like. All the as-
pects of your game are click-
~_jlili_ ing. No one can stop you. After 

t's 102-58 destruction of 
Whittier College, it is safe to say that the 
UCSD women's basketball team is doing the 
Bull Dance. 

"It feels good," forward Anne 
Westmoreland said. "We're really coming 
together as a team. We have g'reat chemis-
try . " 

The Tritons showed what kind of chemis-
try they have against Whittier. Every player 
played for at least nine minutes, and whatever 
combination Head Coach Judy Maloneput in 
the game, it worked. The team hit triple digits 
in scoring (102) for only the second time this 
year. But in the first few minutes of the game, 

it didn't look like the rout ittumed out to be. 
"They came out running, and so did we," 

Westmoreland said. "At one point early 0" 
they were up 13-I 2, but we just kept playing 
hard and then all of the sudden I looked at the 
scoreboard and we were up by 20." 

At the half the lead was 23, 47-24, and the 
Tritons never looked back. The Tritons com-
pletely manhandled the smaller Poet team, 
whose tallest player was 5' 8". Whittier ran a 
curious offense with one post player and four 
perimeterplayers. 

This could 
have confused the 
Tritons, but 
Malone had them 
practicing against 
that offense all 
week. 

Malone knew 
that rebounding 
and taking advantage ofUCSO's taller play-
ers would be the key to shutting Whittier 
down. She also had the team prepare for the 
inevitable fast breaks Whittier would be 
pursuing 

The Tritons responded by outrebounding 
the Poets 62-36, and gelling a combined 46 
points from Westmoreland, Karli Jungwirth, 

Pam Contini and theemerging Sarah Scneider, 
who led all UCSD scorers with 18 points. The 
performance made Malone look like a genius. 

Malone and company' s skills will re-
ceive a much stiffer challenge from their 
next two opponents. Chapman University 
and Pomona-Pitzer College. UCSD has tra-
ditionally had an up-and-down series with 
Chapman. losing at home last year, but then 
exacting revenge on the road . It will be 
interesting to see how the Tritons react to 

Chapman's 
challenge. 

The pressure 
wi II become even 
greater now that 
the new rankings 
are coming out 
soon. 

Teams will be 
gunning forthose 

at the top, and it is common knowledge that 
UCSD is one of the elite. 

That is a great accomplishment for the 
Tritons. but as Malone has been stressing in 
practices, that also means that every gam~ 
will be a'war. Every team is going to try its 
best to dethrone one of the top teams in the 
country.

Continued from Pac. 20 
the best possible scenario for all the book-
ies in Las Vegas? In other words, which 
outcome will benefit them the most? How 
can Frank Rizzo and Sam "Ace" Rothstein 
maximize their profit? 

Well, if they select the Packers to Win by 
a large amount (setting the odds at Green Bay 
by /3 points), the average fan will undoubt-
edly pick the Patriots to cover the poinLS. The 
AFC is due to win a Super Bowl and this is 
the year. And even if they don't win, they 
surely won't lose by more than 13 points. 
This is the thought process that will go on in 
the next two weeks, as thousands of unin· 
formed souls will put money on the Patriots. 

Consequently, Rizzo and company will 
make sure that Green Bay wins by more 
than 13. Face it people, we all know these 
games are fixed . It only takes five minutes 
to watch the horrid performance of refer-
ees to figure out that they are paid. 

So when you're standing in the long 
line at the Bursar's office waiting to get 
your check, think about this. With a little 
time and effort you could be doubling your 
money. As long as, you follow my plan.

Just call me the neighbor-
hood wami . 

For all those bored readers 
who are yawning at the thought 
of reading another column about 
the lack of UCSD fan support or 
the late t news on professional 
sports leagues, you' ve got 
another thing coming. 

I am offering you. the UCSD 
campus, the opportunity of a 
lifetime. I guarantee that if you 
follow my sage advice, you will 
be rewarded handsomely. All 
you need is some capital, a ride 
to Caliente Race and Sports 
Book in Mexico and the guts to 
follow my hunch. 

As I go to press, the Green 
Bay Packers are favored to win 
the Super Bowl over the New 
England Patriots on January 26 
by 13 points. 

If I were you, I'd bet the 
farm on Green Bay to cover. 
Furthermore, the over/under 
number of points to choose 
from should be around 45 , so 
put down the barn on the over. 
It will bea high-scoring affair. 

You see, I have spent 
endless hours of my worthless 
life listening. watching and 
reading about sports. If there is 
a new paper sports section 
hanging around the office, it 's 
a ~ure bet (pardon the pun) tbat 
I have read every word of it. 
Even the golf section. I have 
been accused of listening to 
sports on the radio and I never 
miss an edition of 
"S portscenter." 

Tbus, my qualifications 
speak for themselves. But 
some of you out there aren ' t 
sure yet. I can feel the skepti-
cism and indecision as your 
eyes scroll these words, But 
don't worry. I admit that 
picking winners is not a 
science. I can't see into the 
future, and shit happens. Brell 
Farve, Green Bay's two-time 
NFL MVP, could tear his 
anterior-cruciate ligament on 
the first play of the game.

am never wrong.

UPSET: Playing against 14th~ranked Division II powerhouse UC Riverside, the Tritons rose to the 
challenge and defeated the visiting hoopsters to keep their postseason hopes alive and kicking 
By Kevin MclaUChlin 
Senior Staff Writer 

UC Riverside brought an impres-
sive resume to RIMAC Arena last 
Saturday night. National runner-up 
only two years ago at the Division II 
level, Riverside has remained a solid 
team, equipped with big, athletic play-
ers and outside shooters to match. 

Returning to national prominence 
and sporting a 12-1 record. the High-
landers had no idea what they were 
about to encounter. The volatile 
Tritons took them by supri e, beat-
ing them by a score of 76-66. 

Fresh from destroying University 
of the Redlands, 90-67, the Tritons 
came in playing with confidence and 
cohesion. Lcd lately by the scoring 
punch of the con istent Mall Aune 
and streaky guard Mike Wall, the 
team looked to get off to a fast start. 

Indeed, the men came out of the 
gate like gazelles. playing with in-

spiration and hustle from the outset. 
A combination of quick three-point-
ers, coupled with cold shooting from 
Riverside staked the Tritons to an 
early 11 -2 first -half lead that they 
would never look back from . 

"We played this team last year 
without the attitude that we could 
win," sophomore forward Mike 
Thimgen said. 'This year we be-
lieved we could win." 

The game was close throughout. 
as halftime saw UCSD leading by 
only three. UC Riverside began to 
shoot the ball with ome consis-
tency, notching eight three-pointers 
in the second half. 

With 12 minutes to play, the Tri -
tons found themsel ves down byone. 
To make mailer worse, Wall, their 
leading scorer and ball handler, 
picked up his fourth foul , sending 
him to the bench. 

Though they have lost numerous 
leads late in games this sea\on. this 
time the Tritons closed ranks. Perhaps 
rested by liberal substitutions in the 
first ~alf. the men continued their 
torrid shooting. matching every score 
the Highlanders put up. 

. Playing with 
more desire than 
their talented 
counterparts, 
the Tritons were 
ahead' by one 
when Wall re-
turned . From 
there, Wall con-
tinued the scor-

ing, nailing short jumpers and 
three-pointers as he had all game 
to finish with a game-high 28 
points. 

"Mike' s been struggling with his 
shot a lillie; he's been having some

trouble adjusting to playing point 
guard," Triton Head Coach Greg 
Lanthier said. "But tonight he was 
shooting well, and he presents a lot 
of problems to other teams." 

The Tritons came into the game 
badly needing a win. Another loss 
will most likely take them out of 
postseason consideration, while 
beating a quality opponent such as 
Riverside seriously aids their cause. 
The Tritons looked like the hungrier 
team Saturday night, and it paid big 
dividends. 

"Our defense helped us out." 
Thimgan said. "They weren't play-
ing their best ball. but in the first 
half we played the be~t defense we 
have all year." 

The Tritons have been shooting 
the ball well all season, and last night 
was no exception. The team hit 57 
percent in the second half. and fin-
ished with four scorers in double fig-
ures . 

But it was the stingy defense, 
intelligent passing and aggressive 
rebounding that spelled the differ-
ence in this game. 

"What we did best tonight that 
we haven't done before this year 
was defensive rebounding," guard 
Mark Sebek said. "All five guys 
went to the glass. We got almost 
every loose ball ." 

The Tritons played a complete 
game, bringing all the facets of bas-
ketball together like Voltron to 
soundly defeat what was possibly 
their best oppo'nentthis season. The 
team bears lillie resemblance to the 
quad that lost three straight earlier. 

"We had the opportunities and 
we took advantage of them," 
Lanthier said. "All we're asking is 
to be in the game at the end. We did 
that tonight and made the plays at 
the end that enabled us to win. We 
made the shots we had to down the 
stretch."
