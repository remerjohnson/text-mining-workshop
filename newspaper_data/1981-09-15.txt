Welcome Week 
UCSD can be a cold , hard place, especia ll y for a 

fres.hman. desperately trying to figure out everything 
dunng thIs last week of freedom befor classes begin. 

If we can offer one word of advice to you, it is this: 
take these first few weeks one da y at a time. You don't 
have to take the place by storm, and, by the same 
token, there's really no reason to be intimidated by 
the university or its people. 

Insecurity is a natural feeling in a new 
environment such a . thi '. That' . why Welcome Week 
wa' invented, to helpfre 'hmen identify and cope with 
their fear ' so the transition from high school to 
college is less traumatic. 

Make a habit of getting involved at UCSD by 
starti ng off with Welcome Week activities. Take a 
look at the calendar of events on page 14 of this issue 
and plan to attend the events you feel wi 1I help you 
adjust better to UCSD. 

You may not think you' ll have any trouble handling 
the stress of first quarter cia 'ses - but you haven't 
gone th rough your first midterms yet. And you may 
think you know everything there i. to know about sex 
- but you may have never lived in a cooed dorm 
situation before. 

If you're a joiner, you will undoubtedly find 
Welcome Week a veritable paradise. Shop around and 
choose something in which to get involved. 0 many 
students complain that UCSD i a boring place, when. 
in fact, they are just boring people. 

If you're a follower, don't dispair. Nothing much is 
worth doing if there aren't people to watch and to 
appreciate - and there is plenty to watch and 
appreciate at UCSD if you just look hard enough. 

Your college experience will only be what YOU make 
of it. We know you have probably heard that' since the 
day you graduated high school, but it's true. Don't sell 
yourself - and UC D - short. Get invoh'ed and 
enjoy! 

... Again 
And if you believe that, we've got some nice land in 

the Everglades .... 
All kidding aside, werealizethat what may be awe-

in 'piring and thought-provoking for freshmen -
lines at the book ·tore, crowds at the registrar - is 
probably nothing more than 21.:1 irritating 
inconvenience to the returning student. You've seen 
it before and you' ll see it again. 

But there's more to life than lines and crowds. A 
num ber of crucial student i 'sues deserve our whole· 
hearted attention this year. For example, campus· 
wide affirmative action (yeah, remember Emorv 
Tolbert) sl ill isn't nearly what it ought to be. 
Undergraduates continue to take somewhat of a back 
sea t to research when it comes to money and 
attention. . 

Yet, amid all of this turmoil and injus tice, there 
remains widespread student apathy. And don't 
expe.ct thing ' to change if we co.ntinue to neglect the 
erosIon of UCSD as a faIr, student -oriented 
institution. 

Don't let UC D or yourself deteriorate any further. 
We know you have a lot of talent, or you wouldn ' t be 
here. Together, with all we have to offer , we can make 
this coming year a meaningful cxperien e for those 
who care enough to lend their individual ta lents in an 
effort to make C Dab Lter place for all stuclent s. 

We 'll do our part. Will you?

GLEN AND SHEARER 

The trials of college love 
What's the biggest mistake 

students can make when they 
en t er college? -

Look for t he love of their 
!i\'e -. 

This fall, on nearlv e\'er\, 
campus, there are sure to be a 
handful of couples who will 
lose their marbl s O\'('r each 
other. They'llthro\\' OUI their 
roommall;s and mO\'e in 
together It usually takes less 
than a week. . 

Other~ just thro\\' them· 
seh'es into relat ionships thaI 
would rival Antonv and 
Cleopatra·s. . 

What t rou bles co llege 
psychologists i: t hat more and 
more campus couples are 
adm itt ing that violence is part 
of t heir love Ii \·es. 

Indeed, after four \ ears at 
one Midwestern college , our 
associate Michael Duff\' 
not iced the following: . 

-College officials separat e 
a couple sharing a dormitory 
room after he pus hes her down 
a flight of stairs during a 
typical late-nigh I spat. 

-A student lock ' his 
girlf riend in hi ' room for four 
straight days in order to "keep 
track" of her. 

-A young st udent is 
severely beaten by her 
boyfriend for dancing with 
another fellow at a party. 

What every freshman may 
not know i~ that st udent 
r lat ionship<.; are increasingly 
violent. 

r~ ecent studiefo. at Oregon 
State, Cornell and other 
schoob have re\ ea led t hat at 
leas t one·third of college 
student s have either been 
s I a p ped . s h ()\' ed . bit ten , 
rough ed up , kicked or 
threatened bv 100'ers in the 
course of t heir college ca reers, 
some have yen been 
threat ened with guns or 
knives in Ihe name of love. 

It' s hard to imagine how 
serious college aff(lini can get. 
Som young lovers throw 
heart and sou I into "t he 
relal iOnf,hip," thinking ii's 
alwaYli the right thing to do. 

Violence in college relat ion · 
ships is caused by common 
misunderstandings , jealous· 
ies, a 1coholism and differences 
in commitmen ts - conditions 
which have a ll be n linked to 

abuse among m(lrried couples. 
"College st udents arejust as 

likelv to run into violence as 
adulis. but less like l\' to do 
anything about it ," said judv 
Brown of Ihe Ann Arbor 
(Michl Domest ic Violence 
Project. Sh said st udent" at 
I he University of Michigan. 
for examp le , are "more 
interesll'<l in intellectualizing 
their problems than actually 
\\'orking t hem out. They "a~ 
being "lapped i~n't a problem. 
but theycan 't \\ alka\\'ay from 
their relat ionshi p." 

Not surpris ingly , aboul ;)0 
percrn t of the s t udent~ 
inl en'ie\\,ed in an Oregon 
Stat e sun'ey adm itted to being 
invol \'e d in the same 
relat ionship a year after first 
bemg (lbused . And almost all 
of the respondents \\'ho \\'ere 
abused said their relation · 
sh ips \\'ere "serious." 

One problem, of course. is 
li\' ing together. About one· 
third of all college studenls 
have done il. And some 80 
percent say they'd be willing if 
I he right p rson came along. 

But living toget her in a 
dorm is tricky . You're alone 
with your lover in a big 
boarding house wit h any· 
where from 300 to ] ,000 other 
people. And instead of having 
roommates , friends and 
professors to turn to , students 
fmd themselves unloading 
their anxiet ie;; and frustra · 
tion ~ on roommat -lovers, 
Somet imes thi s dependence 
turn s violent. 

Even off campus, coll ege 
s tuden ts don't forsee the 
pressures of I ivi ng loget her. 
A 1\ t hey see are t he glories of 
full -time commitment andlhe 
glamour of watching I he 
"Today" ~how toget her each 
morning. 

A not her problem is privacy. 
A t small co lleg s, everyone 
knows when a couple "shacks 
up." The pressure to s tav 
together is overpowering, 
Couples go to such great 
I ngt hs 10 arnlllgf' common 
quarters that, frequent Iy, they 
have no opt ion but to s tal' 
toget her. . 

With such pressures on 
st udent~, it's less surpris ing to 
he ar about fo.op homores 
Iwating up eac h o th er 

(according to the sun·eys. men 
ha\ e been abused as often as 
women at times). 

Of course. we're nol again,.,t 
Im'e, and \\ 'e hardl \' frown on 
romancing. But I he dangers of 
get ting in O\'er your head don 'I 
go away just because dadd~' is 
paying for nx)m and hoard. 

Whal \\'f:' recommend mav 
hl' \\'{ WI h thinking aboul. 
Fi rst, \\'e suggest t hat college 
st udenl s become good friends 
before Jumping in the sack. 
Y()ur abilil) tl' get along as 
frie nd,., mat ters more in the 
long run than anything else. 

r f things don' t seem right. 
don't be afraid to go for help, 
Stay in touch with friend,., and 
professors if vou mO\'e in with 
someone ebe~ 

!Vlost of all. pay attent ion to 
pl'rsonal needs. Like all lovers . 
collegr sl udents will bear 
almost anything for the sake 
of I he relat ions hip. Aft er a 
\\ 'hile, coping becomes a \Vav 
of life. . 

Of course, a\'oiding violence 
in love affa irs won't beashard 
as passing t hat first exam, But 
you\'e got to take your 
perso nal relationships as 
seriously as your course work.

a\\,ailt.'<I Atkinson's arri\'al. 
The events leading liP to 
former Chancellor Willi am 
McElroy 's resignat ion and 
the subsequent search for his 
replacement had left 
st udents . faculty and staff 
wit h bad mem()rie~; and 
frayer! nerves. Campus·wide

lay in ugly disrepair. And tC)

had jus t focused on l !C '])

Welcome to llC D. 
Outlined Goals 

Lasl September. an 
ambil ious AI kinson outlined 
his major goals for the year 
no\\' passed. At the top of hi~ 
list were restructuring his 
support ive net work of vice 
chancellors and re\' iving a 
comatosed affirmat i\'e act ion 
program. 

The restructuring hat; 
gone we ll. Atkinson says. 
"We've had a very active year 
and we recruited a new d an 
for the medical scho I, and a 
Vice Chancellor of Medica l 
Affairs, a new Vice 
Chane Ilor of Undergraduate 
Affairs and put in placea Vice 
Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs and a director for 
budget and planning - in 
fael, we're :ort of swimming 
in all of Ihis," he says. 

Affirmati\"e action . 
however, was a road on 
wh ich Atkinson found man\' 
obstacles. Hi s first year's 
excursIOn into minorit v 
affairs was capped inJune b\' 
a st udent si t ·in in his office 
protest ing the impending 
dismissal of Rlack lIi ston' 
Professor E mol'\' Tol bert . 
Thirl v-four stucients were 
arrested after a riot ,;quad 
mm'l>d in 10 clear the \Mice. 
and charges against them are 
"li ll pO(,llding. In thl' mean 
tillle. Atkinson follo\\ (>(1 the 

hi ~ tor y d 'parlll1el1t's 
recomillendat ion not to grant 
Tolbert tenure. anci a Black 
hi s tory profe ssor from 
Stanford l ni\'ers ilv was 
recruited 10 replace h·im . 

" We're not interesled in 
pressing t he charges (againsl 
the sludents)." Atkinson 
insis ts. " I am amazt.'<I that 
thi,., thing is st ill hanging; 
you can clearly understand 
I rom my poi n t of view t hat I 
wou ld have liked to have seen 
I hat (t aken care of) ages ago. 

"Not hing's going 10 come

Off campus housing market tight 
By PEGGY rYES 

This year has proved no 
different from others in 
terms of off·campus housing 
shortage '. Homele" UCSD 
st udents will attest to the 
fact that the hou 'ingscarcity 
ha ' caused them to search 
dispairingly for hour ' upon 
end through the card·st udded 
bulletin boards of the off-
camp u ' housing office . 
However. Off · Campus 
Hou ' ing Director Gloria 

pencer urges those 
unfortunates to keep on 
looking. 

pencer says this year'~ 
race for off·campus hou ' ing 
started about two weeks 
earlier than last year. 

tudent · are ·till haunting 
the off·campu . office in hupes 
of fi nd i ng t he perfect 
apartment before schoo l 
starts next Monday . Spencer 
believe ' t hat everyone shou ld 
be able to find a place to live 
before Monday, a: there are a 
number of "roommates 
needed" posted and the 
greatest-ever number of 
room' for rent in private 
hume ' ·till open. However, 
"t here is a defin ite shortage 
of affordable housing." she 
ays. 

In the past. there have 
u ' ually been listings for 
approximately 25 room s in 
private home:;. A rece nt 
promotions campaign netted 
over 200 li :;tings for UC ]) 
student avail a bilil v. 

"Thi s isn ' t th e 111 0s t 
popular (housing) for t he 

student · because most want 
their own apartment. 
However, many (rooms) are 
not family si tuation s," 

pencer aid. Included in the 
"room ' for ren t" category 
may be guest cottages. rooms 
with private baths and 
private entrances. Man y of 
these s ituat ions may provide 
the st udent with the privacy 
he or s he needs wi thou t the 
extra cost for an apartment 
rental. penc r says that the 
people renting the rooms 
have realized the "econo· 
mics" of renting out an 
unoccupied room to a 
·t udent. 

ew condominiums in the 
area have a lso provided 
students with more outlets 
for livi ng close to campus 
than before . However . 
"condo conversion '" have 
also posed a problem to 
st udents looking for hou ·ing. 

Of t he approximately 
ll.500 ·tudents enrolled at 
UCSD this fall. approximate' 
Iy one·thi rd livein on·campus 
hou ·ing. one-third live at 
home and the remaining 
th ird (approximately 3,200 
st udents) must be accomo· 
dated by off-campus housing. 
Spencer says that in t he pas t 
she has only had one student 
t hreated to leave the 
university because he was 
unable to find a plac to live. 
but she ~ays his demands 
limited hi s chance of locating 
an apartment. he ad \' ise~ 
that st udent s first con~ider 
budget and locat Ion rest ric-

t ions befor e sea rching 
through the availabi lit y 
list ing ' at her office. The off· 
campus housing office also 
provides several a id s for 
beginn rs at the "house 
hunt ing" gam . The Off-

Campus Housi ng Directory is 
available for various location 
list ings. free rental ag ncy 
phone num bers are provided 
and free phones are also 
convenient lv located in the 
office. -

There are approximately 
30· 100 new room listings

UCSD enrollOlent 
at all-tilUe high 

By LI A SULLIVAN 
A~soda t c Nt,,\,:, Edi tur 

Enrollmen t at UC D will 
hit an all·time high of about 
9400 undergraduate ' thi s 
fa ll. surpass ing last year 's 
lOt al of 9049. 

Contributing to the grand 
total will be approximately 
2.075 new freshmen and 860 
trans fer s tudents according 
to projectio ns from the 
Regi s trar' s office. Exact 
enrollment figures will be 
known in three weeks. 

The "average intelligence" 
of t he new fres hman class 
has not yet been determined . 
But las t yea r 's average fros h 
entered CSD wit h a high 
school GPA of :3.54. 

AT scores of llCSD 
fres hmen have been among 
the highe~t of a ll nine UC 
cam puses ill recen t years. 
Las t year's average math 
score of 570 was second nnlv 
to Berke ley. The verbal score 
of 510 was third highe~t. 
fo ll ov, ing number one 
Berke ley and Santa Cru7. 

However. these rei at i\'el \' 
high AT scores are lowe'r 
than those of earlier vears. 
reflecting the na tiOtiwid e 
downward trend of AT 
scor s. 

The nat ional decline could 
ha\'e many expla nation s: 
more s t udents no\\' take the 
test: moreminoritiestake the 
tes t a nd feel that it may be 
culturall y bia"ed: the 'test 
may s impl y be outdated; or 
perhaps t here has been a 
decadence of teaching the 
three R's at lower lev Is of 
education. eApen s say.

Much of the growt h in

Wants You! 

Looking for a fun, productive way to balance the tedium of classes? The UCSD Guardian may be just

We are looking hard for energetic students who love to write, meet people and work hard. If you 've 
ever written for a newspaper - and even if you haven't - come write for UCSD's bi-weekly student 

newspaper. 

We need writers in all our departments: news, arts, science and sports. Writers in all departments are 
the newspaper's " eyes" on the university, and are responsible for interviewing, attending campus 

meetings and events and writing articles. 

If you 'd like to wnte for us, come to our first Orientation meeting this Friday, September 18 at 11 am. 
We'll explain how the paper works and answer your questions. Afterwards, we'll hold a writing and 

interviewing workshop. You may also receive your first story assignment. 

Friday's meeting will be held at our offices, located on the south edge of Revelle campus. We're In 
the old Coffee Hut, cloistered among a grove of eucalyptus. Be sure to come. 

If you would like to work for us in another capacity, we are also looking for students in photography, 
production, typesetting, and d istribution. If you are interested, stop by our offices any time, or apply 
through student employment. Our phone number is 452-3468. We need your help, Note: returning 

staff members need not wait for the Orientation meeting. Stop by sometime before Friday. 

We're your student newspaper.

different this year 

Becau se of funding 
limitat ions, there wi11 be 
so me c hanges in th 
operation of the Student

this fall. 

A11 student s paying full 
registration fees will

provided by the t uden t 
Bealt h n ' ice :taff wit hout 
addi t ional charge. Infirmary 
care will be available Monday 
through Frida y only. 
Eligibility to use the Studen t 
Health ervice s tops when 
full regi strat ion terminates. 

The tudent Helath Center 
wi11 be open from 8 a.m. to 
11 :30 a.m . and I p.m . to 4:30 
p.m. Monday through Friday 
only. A registered nurse will 
be available at night during 
the week for ass is tance. 
Howeve r, the Student Health 
Center now will be closed on 
weekends and holida ys. 

If medical help is needed at 
night during the week, ca11 
the nurse at the Sludent 
Hea lth Center first at 452-
3300. 

On weekends and holidays, 
when the Student Health

alt ernative care is avai lahle 
from local hospital emer-
gency rooms . Payment is 
probably required to pay for 
such services . Reimburse-

ment from the Ext ernal 
Medical Account (EMA) of 
t he Stu den t Healt h Service 
may be available in some 
instan ces. Contact th e EMA 
clerk at 452 ·2123 on the firs t 
working day after your visit

It has become necessary to 
re st ri ct e rtain benefit s 
prcviously available from the 
EMA. From now on. EMA 
cannot cover any expenses 
for surgical. ort hopedic. or 
s imilar procedures. Also, 
thcre wi ll be no payments for

A n ew s ickne ss and 
accident insurance plan has 
been negotiated with the

to obtain some coverage a~ 
soon as possible.

Phone Center 
Store on call1pus 

Getting a phone installed 
in dorm rooms will be more 
expensive this year than 
ever. Because of a California 
Public Utilities Commission 
decision made last spring, 
phone installation rat es and 
deposit · have been raised to 
account for inflation. These 
price hike ' went into effect 
Aug. 28, and wi ll be passed on 
to the tudent consumer this 
fall. The installation fee went 
up from $16 to $22 and the 
deposit required for the 
phone went from $25 to $60. 

For the rare ·tudent with 
major credit cards and ot her 
indication' of financial 
stability - an automobile 
registered in t he state of 
California, check ing and 
sav ings accounts, for 
example - the $60 depo~it 
can be waived by filling out 
an application for a credit 
rat ing check. The deposit can 
also be guaranteed by a 
second party - a friend or 
relative perhaps - who ca n 
meet Pacific Telephone '~ 

credit rating requirement ·. 
In addition to the cost of 

the phone depos it and the 
installat ion fee there is the 
cost of the phone itself, which 
varies according to the type of 
instru ment. 

Arrangement · to hav a 
phone installed can be mad . 
upon presentation of two 
pieces of 1.0. and a P.O. Box 
number , at a temporary 
"Phone Center Store" locat ed 
in the Revell formal and 
informal lountes (behind

Looking for a fun, productive way to balance the tedium of classes? The UCSD Guardian may be just 
what you need, 

We are looking hard for energetic students who love to write, meet people and work hard. If you've 
ever written for a newspaper - and even if you haven't - come write for UCSD's bi-weekly student 

newspaper. 

We need writers in all our departments: news, arts, science and sports, Writers in all departments are 
the newspaper's "eyes" on the university, and are responsible for interviewing, attending campus 

meetings and events and writing articles. 

If you'd like to write for us, come to our first Orientation meeting this Friday, September 18 at 11 am, 
We'll explain how the paper works and answer your questions. Afterwards, we'll hold a writing and 

interviewing workshop, You may also receive your first story assignment. 

Friday's meeting will be held at our offices, located on the south edge of Revelle campus. We're in 
the old Coffee Hut, cloistered among a grove of eucalyptus. Be sure to come. 

If you would like to work for us in another capacity, we are also looking for students in photography, 
production, typesetting, and distribution_ If you are interested, stop by our offices any time, or apply 
through student employment. Our phone number is 452-3468. We need your help. Note: returning 

staff members need not wait for the Orientation meeting, Stop by sometime before Friday. 

We're your student newspaper.

Harrison Ford (above) as Indiana Jones made Raiders of the Lost A rk the biggest h it of the 
summe r , while Cannonball Run (bottom) with its big stars was a major flop. 

The good, the bad and the 
ugly of this SUnttner's filtns 

By RICK GREENE 
Staff Writer 

This past summer has been 
a good one for t he motion 
picture industry. A lot of 
movies made a lot of money for 
a lot of people - and a healthy 
handfull of them were actually 
good movies. Cinematically, 
this was no dog day ummer. ... 

The best film of t he lot was ' 
by far Speilberg and Lucas' 
Raiders of the Lost A rk. I n fact . 
it wa~ 100 good because 
C\ er~ I h mg e1'it' se med to pale 

I 
in cornpari~(m. Haidas was 
packed to the s am: with 
incre(hble action, spectacular 
effect. ddring heroIcs. pi les of 
nake5 and even mild religion. 

Almost as important as the 
thrill. and the fun. Raiders 
was the first movie in a long 
time which left you tingling 
after leaving the theater, the 
first movie since ... The Empire 
Strikes Back? 

And strike back it did, as 
Lucasfilms, Ltd. rereleased 
Empire for its first big reissue, 
and though it was up against 
some hefty competition, it 
managed to earn multi· 
millions more and was placed 
among the top five money· 
earners throughout the last 
half of the summer. More of a 
middle than a complete film 
within itself. Empire is 
nevertheless a dazzling 
display of film technology 
along with incredible action, 
daring heroic ', mild religion 
and even a few snakes, 

Superman 11 was the other 
big smash of the summer, 
though it didn't have as good 
"legs" as Raiders. Most of the 
fun in t his film was derived 
from the wonderful perform· 
allcec by Chnstopher Reeves 
as both The Man of Steel and 
Clark Kent and the conti nuing 

roma~ce bet wecn these two I gl.}:- ~Ild Lois Lane. lIlt' su per 
hat t 1(" bet ween Superman 
and I he Ilm'(' Phant om Zon 
oul laws were good ~tu ff. but 
I he sappy acl Ions of t he {'xl ras 
in MelrOIX)It '· s poiled a good 
deal of it. I mean, who would 
actually drive around, order 
Kentucky Fned Chicken, 
vacuum a s tore or talk 
casually on the phone when 
the violent battle of th 
entury is going on just inches 

away? Come on , Hichard 
Lesl r , let 's be s rious! 

Another old friend with us 
again was James Bond 007 in 
the twelfth film of the s ries, 
For raul' I~ Vl'S Ollly. It 's 

amazing when you realize that 
producer Albert R. Broccoli 
has been making Bonds for 20 
years now, and even more 
amazing that after a few false 
starts with Roger Moore in the 
early seventies. the series has 
hit its s tride again and become 
more popular t han ever. Eyes, 
while not the be t of the lot 
(how cou ld it be, without Sean 
Connery), is certainly the most 
polished of the Moores and, 
like many summer movies, 
good fun. O ld 007 is not as 
virile as he once was, but then 
it has be n twenty years. 

DUIKol1slayer was a 
s urprisingly good fantasy with 
a truly fearful dragon done up 
right via sto p motion 
animal ion . I ife·size models and 
loud Dolby soundeffects. John 
Carpenter' , Escape From New 
York was less 'ucce 's ful but 
quite intere 'ting with an 
East wood ian (have I creat ed a 
new adject ive?) Kurt Russell 
sent into maximum security 
prison Manhattan to fish out 
the Presidtmt before his neck 
ex plodes ~Russell's neck. that 
is. since Donald Pleasence as 
the Presiden t had no neck. just 
a brief cafle). 

The last of the good summer 
films was a recent one, Firs! 
Monday in October s tarring 
Walter Matthau and Jill 
Clayburgh and based on a play 
by Lawrence and Lee (Inherit 
the Wind, A l/I/lie Marne, et c.). 
Easily the most intelligent 
movie of the su mmer. First 
Monday dealt wisely and 
wittily with I he inner· 
worki ngs of t he Supreme 
Court when a woman is finally 
appointed to it. 0 acl ion, no 
specia l effeet~, no sex (aside 
from a shower shot of 
Clavbunrhl and not even a 

snake, F,rst Monday in October 
was a refreshing joy. 

And w hat would a summer 
slew of sludge be without the 
s ludge - and this summer 
certainly wasn ' t s ludgele s! 
Mel Brooke's History Of The 
World, Part One was a vulgar, 
offensive atrocity and, most 
important, it wasn't at a ll 
funny (though I did like "Jews 
In Space"). Even worse than 
Ihat was The Cannonball Run 
wit hits plast ic cast of Burt 
Reynolds, Hoger Moore and 
Farrah Fawcett. . cr en 
dialogue re'dched a new low 
here in this plol less serie'i of 
fun and games spliced logel her 
as a major mot Ion picture. 

Wolves popped up in two 
summer misfires , the worsi 
being Albert Finney in IVOUl?1l. 
a silly, gory batch of murders 
by a pack of wolves livi ng in a 
New York church. The real 
dis appointment was director 
John Landis' An A merican 
Werewolf in Londun. a horror· 
comed y without any horror or 
comedy, strange coming from 
the man who made Animal 
House and The Blues Bru/hers. 
Maybe he should have stuck 
with John . Belushi? 

Bill Murray in Stripes was 
not hing more or noth ing less 
than Bill Murray in Stripes and 
Ray Harryhausen's new stop 
motion animation film Clash 0/ 
the Titans was strictly kiddie· 
fodder. On the other hand, 
Disney's The Fox And The 
Hound was t heir best 
animal cd effort since The 
JunKie Book and featured an 
exciting climax with a gri"zly 
bear in I he classic Disney 
sty le.

Science returns to the Guardian 
continued from pase 33 

The connection between monks and a scientist 
may seem lIlittle obscure at this point, but it is just 

"my round about way of introducing the science 
section and the ideas behind it. By providing some 
background I hope to illuminate the underlying 
philosophy of the section. its general perspective, 
and its basic goals. The science section is something 
of a phoenix . rising once again from its own ashes. 
Those of you who have been with 'us in the past 
know that there was no science section proper in 
The UCSD Guardian last year. To you readers who 
are enjoying The Guardian for the first time. we cn 
extend our (my) welcome. The science section is not 
carrying on a hallowed tradition established by 
generations of previous editors. It is. in point of fact 
starting from scratch. and is bound to suffer some of 
the teething pain as well as the rapid growth of 
youth. It is hoped that in this infancy, the section 
will reflect the freshness of perspective that 
accompanies youth. and is so often lost in dogmatic 
adherence toold rules. "This may be well and good," 
you say, "but whal about the monks?" I opened with 
them and the scientist because it is through them 
that [ first had the insight which is at the very heart 
of thi science sec~ion. They struck me because they 
are different and yet so very similar. 

In times past religion played a much greater role 
in people's lives ~han it does, by and large, today . 
There was what has been called a religious world 
view. That is, people thought about the world, the 
cosmos, life, death, and the deeper question is 
religious terms: God's will, sin, grace, salvation, 
damnation, and so on. Religion was a real force in 
the world, real in the sense that it affected people 
and events in the world, not just on paper or in 
thought. Religion was a force of change. 

In a world filled wit h ignorance, the clergy was a 
bastion of scholarship and learning. The clerics 
preserved the Latin texts , a few Greek works which 
have been transcribed, and of course the Holy Bible. 
These monks and prie ts kept alive the spark of 

. knowledge which later burst into the flame of the 
'Renai ance. 

The cleric's learning had profound consequences. 
By virtue of their education they were segregated 
from the rest of the population by a huge chasm: 
literacy, The people needed the priests to interpret 
the religious teachings becaus~~~e wri!~en and 
spoken word of God was inaccesi51e to an except a 
few of the very rich. "Libera animas omnium 
fidelium," chant the monks. Incomprehensible 
mumblings to the ignorant peasant, yet the 
language of the holy. There was awe, a little fear 
perhaps of those people who cou ld understand the 
sacred mumblings on which salvation or damnation 
depended . The mystique and power of the church 
was rooted in ignorance. 

The priests served as the liaison between heaven 
and earth. [n this role as mediator. the clergy 
enjoyed a certain amount of power, for without their 
su pport and intervention , t he individual on earth 
was doomed to eternal damnation. Granted thi 
need for a mediator bet ween man and God was 
el iminated by denominations which rebelled 
against the old order. but allow me to simplify for 
t he sake of clarity. 

We have presented three aspects of the medieval 
clergy: their place as scholars and learned men , the 
inaccessibility of their field of knowledge to the 
general public, and their role as liaison or mediator 
which follows naturally from the first two 
considerations. At this point , su bstitute the modern 
scientific community for the medieval clergy. [find 
the parallel irresistable. 

In the centuries that have passed between that 
foggy morning and today many things have 
changed. The role of religion has diminished and 
been replaced by science, predominantly physical 
science. Though some will disagree, I would say 
that science has become the predominant world 
view, or at least intellectual view, in the west, and it 
is spreading inexorably in the east. We consider the 
cosmo ' not in terms of God, but in the terms of 
phy 'ical science: force. momentum, mass, and so 
forth. The conception of man himself has changed . 
We are. in the extreme view, a sack of sea water 

containing some interesting and unique chemical 
reactions. This view doe ' not leave much room for ' 
the soul. Science and its methods are in the 
intellectual vanguard and the predominant force of 
change in the m~ern world. And for &?Od reason, as 
science has given men power 10 measures 
previously inconceivable: cure of diseases. flights to 
the planets. machines that think, atomic weapons. 
The list goes on. 

The scientist is at the focus of thi '. Like the cleric 
in times past. he is the scholar. Today's public is 
denied acce ' to the content and workings of 
science, just a they were denied access to religious 
works centuries ago. The inaccessibility of science 
is based on a pervasive ignorance, a scientific 
illiteracy. This ignorance is encouraged by the 
complexity and intrinsically esoteric nature of 
science. Science i . surrounded by a mystiquet hat is 
perpetuated. sometimes innocently. sometimes 
intentionally by the scien t ific elite. At in titutions 
of higher learning. such as UCSD, novices are 
trained in the rites. but the mystique remains 
intact. As the disciple!; of cience, scienti!;ts are 
called on as advisors. gurus to t he non·initiate. They 
are. as were the monks. the liaison between the 
public and the power that shapes the world. 

Science has given new meaning to the phrase 
"shape the world." Large portions of the globe's 
surface can be rearranged at the push of a button . 
The combustion of fossil fuels produces an 
atmospheric blanket which will raise mean 
temperatures across the planet and alter climates 
and vegetation. With this increased power goes 
increased responsibility both on the part of 
scientists and non·scientists alike. Science is the 
coral reef of human achievement, each individual 
adding his or her small part until over the centuries 
a structure of incredible scope and magnitude is 
created. While each individual cannot hope to 
control the whole, he can control hi part. Scientists 
are responsible for their own contribution. Non· 
scientists are responsible for their own education :

must be capable of uncler· 
standing what is presented in 
the media. So many decisions 
today are based in science or 
it s technological offshoots . 
Sc ientific liter acy is a 
prerequisite for intelligent 
judgements on such iss ues as 
nuclear power. haza rdou s 
waste dispos al. and a lterna· 
tive energies. Arguments pro 
and con on such issues can be 
evaluated on ly on the bas is of 
some scientific knowledge. 
So much of our life is touched 
by science and technology 
that our own self interest a!; 
we ll as co n s tru c tiv e 
participation in the social and 
political stru cture~ demands 
fundamental scientific 
knowledge. The amount 
required is growing as fast as 
science progresse~. 

[ am finally ready to 
introduce t he science sect ion . 
It is the task of the science 
\\Titer to bridge the gap of 
ignorance and mak science 
accessible to those people 
who are affect eel by it. This is 
one of t he goals of Tile 
Guordian's science section: 
to denl\stifv ~cience. This is 
the re",por1:-..ibility of the 
science \\Titer to t he non ·

proportion of people who are

paper has a responsibility to 
them a ' well. This i ' a 
newspaper and it is unfitting 
to try and 'make it a technical 
journal. Rat her than treat the 
stuff of science, molecules 
and waves an d things, we 
wi ll look at the interfaces of 
sc ience and non ·science 
elements. Sc ience, like any 
human undertaking is not a 
self·contained entit y. Only 
text book ' c ience is 
abstracted and removed from 
reality . Real science is people, 
money. equipment. ego', and 
!;uch. This real science takes 
place in a social. polit ica!. and 
et hical cont ext. We hope that 
our science oriented readers 
will find items of interest and 
value in our treatment of 
science's relation to the rest 
of the world . 

It is our intention to 
present science. its workings. 
its workers, it s achieve·

a manner that s t imu lates our

Tritons gear up for 1981 season 
By BOB McSPADDEN 

Sport s Editor 
Intercol\egiateathlet ics. At 

many schools up and down 
the West Coast it is the 
backbone of the univers ity. 
Take, fo r exa m ple, the 
notoriety of USC, UCLA and 
San Diego tate. Alt hough at 
least two of the t hree are all 
out·stan din g academic 
s choo l ' , t hey are a ll 
nationally recogn ized instead 
for thei r at hlet ic programs. 

At UCSD, intercollegiate 
at hletics takes a back seat to 
academics. The goal of the 
univers ity is, after all , to 
educate the students . Yet 
UCSD is definit e ly not 
without a strong a thlet ic 
program. 

Taking a closer look into 
UCSD's athletic structure 
reveals a program budding 
from some very fertil e seeds. 
The Tritons field some 29 
teams throughout the year , 
in c luding interco ll egiat e 

fe ncing and snow ski ing. T he 
non ·schola rs hip tradit ion

attributes, among these 
bei ng the loca t ion and 
academic tradition. 

T he Tritons wi ll sport a 
number of very stro ng 
sq uad s this Fa ll , includi ng 
the mens ' waterpolo team 
which po 'se 'ses ret urn ing 
AlI ·America ns Dan E b y,

1980 season with an overall 
19·]0 s howing. 

Also looking to better t heir 
1980 seasons will be t he 
men 's and women's c ross 
country teams, men's soccer 
and women's volleybal l. 

U CS D's in t e r coll egi a te

Intercollegiate s ports at 
UCSD may be very attractive 
to the high school at hlete who 
may not have otherwise had 
the opportunity to compete at 
anot her school. Although 
many UCSD intercollegiate 
coaches spend a great deal of 
time in recruiting, many 
teams are led by walk·on 
athletes.

Women spikers show 
depth in '81 

By BOB McSPADDEN 
ports Editor 

The women's 1981 volleyball squad , coming off a good 18·13 
overall record la t year, find s itself in an entirely different 
league thi year. 

The Tritons, who in past years have partici pated in the 
AlA W league, have accepted an invitation into the newly 
formed NCAA division . This is the first year that the NCAA 
will sponsor post-season tournaments for women's athletics, 
and teams will have four years to decide whether to compete 
in the NCAA or the AIAW. 

UCSD's women spikers return this season with a very 
young, aggressive team. Returning from last year's varsity 
squad are sophomores Louise Schwartz, Michele Whitmore 
and Vickie Pride, who will be aided by transfer Tammy Smit 
and freshmen Kristen Kilbourn and Molly Wheatley. Smit, 
who is a 5'9" sophomore from Washington State, will be used 
primarily as a hitter/ blocker. Both Wheatley and Kilbourn 
are likely candidates for positions at hitter. 

UCSD's 1981 squad will feature only two juniors, 5'8" Diane 
Nobel, a transfer from Cypress Junior College, and 5'9" 
Marilyn Horn, also a tran fer from UC Irvine. Horn, who is 
nur ing a tretch fracture, will be out of hard play for at least 
two week ' . Rounding out the fie ld wi ll be four ophomores 
and nine freshmen. 

With entrance into the NCAA Western region , UCSD faces 
a much tougher schedule than in previous years. Among the 
22 scheduled matches the Tritons are paired with eight 
Division I or Division II teams. Assistant coach Mike Hipp 
comments, "Even if our record doesn't equal that of other 
team ' in the region, our chance of going to a po t sea on 
tournament are good ba ed olely on our rough schedu le. " 

Over the weekend , UCSD travelled north for the UC Davis 
tournament. which 'ported over 40 teams from around the 
nation. Among its matches, UCSD was paired with perennial 
powers Oregon State and UC Riverside. Round ing out their 
weekend stay the Tritons faced the Univers ity of San 
Francisco and St. Mary's College. 

The Tritons have greater depth in all positions this year in 
compari son to last year. Hipp adds, "Although the team is 
young, there is a lot of talent in every position. Last year we 
weren't teaching the more complicated plays until later in the 
season. With only two weeks of practice the girls are really 
coming around well. Threr is going to be a great deal of 
competition for the starting positions this year.' 

The Tritons play host this coming Sunday at 7:30 p.m. to 
NCAA Division I powerhouse USIV. 

UCSD's women's volleyball team is much younger but with much more depth 
than 1979's team shown in action a bove.

Intratnurals: Just 
good, clean fun 

By BOB Me PADDEN 
ports Editor 

There are a variety of 
student pa ·times at this 
unique university nestled in 
among the eucalyptus trees. 
Some people come here 
merely to get a good 
education in as little time as 
possible and get back out into 
that big world. Others take 
their time and, instead of 
carrying 20 units , they layoff 
the books on weekends and 
watch a football game with a 
cold beer in their hand. And 
then there is the person who 
takes the road in between the 
aforementioned - this is the 
intramural athlete. 

There is a tradition at 
UCSD. A very long-standing 
tradition. To play the 
intramural game is not taken 
lightly among the majority of 
participants here. To put it 
on the line, people actually 
have been known to venture 
out into the cold rain and ruin 
a favorite tee-shirt by digging 
their skull into the mud when 

those guys and gals who 
enjoy a Ii ttle wet fun 
together, this sport combines 
the skill of tubing with the 
fun of chasing (the ball , that 
is). 

Volleyball - one of the 
more ser iou s of the 
intramural sports on 
campus. Six person co-ed 
teams battle it out for seven 
weeks to the AAA, AA and A 
divisional playoffs. 

Team Tennis - somewhat 
like World Team Tennis, this 
sport gathers four member 
C()oed teams into men's and 
women's singles, men's and 
women's doubles and mixed 
dou bles competition. There is 
a lot of rough competition in 
this one. 

Three-on-three basketball 
- two matches on game 
nights really give the old bod 
a good workout. The 
competition in the big leagues 
gets reall y fierce, so players 
had better practice your jump 

I ntram ural sports give the 
student a chance to get some 
relief from the books while 
getting some exercise. There is a 
sport for everyone at UCSD. 

sliding into home plate. Or 
there is the in t ramural 
basketball play r who think, 
hI' will be the next Dr. J and 
mus t prove this by scram· 
blmg for a loo 'e 'ball and 
uffer from fl oor burn. 

th rough01lt the week. All of 
this. the hundred ~ claim year 
alter year. i" jus t good, hard 
fun . 

For the5e fa natics, the 
intramural department, alias 
Mike Hipp and /or Scott 
Berndes, provides a variety of 
ways for the student to close 
the book and knock himself 
out. The e two, as per UCSD 
tradi t ion. ha ve arranged 
another year packed full of 
that good, hard fun, start ing 
this fall with the following 
'ports: 

Flag football - a favor ite 
among fans who think there 
is more to life than si mpl y 
watching other ' play the 
game on TV . It's rumored 
that over one hundred team 
will once again batt Ie for 
invitation to either the 
Animal, Banana. Cadaver or 
Climax bowls, so experts say 
that early recruiting by team 
captains will be crucia l. 

Innertube Waterpolo - for 

- .~ III, ' '( . 

shot before taking on some of 
t hese guys . This is a good 
fJ pportunity to get out and 

how who's the boss on the 
cou rt. Who knows , J oh n 
Block may just be looking for 
another guard . 

Floor Hockey - the Fall 
version of this s port i:-. 
s trictly cooed, and the "ix 
person teams really give that 
0)' puck a·bruisin' during the 
.aaql.e. J3etter put on the pad . 

Ultimate Frisbee - the 
newest of intramural sports 
introduced to fans last year 
and put into full force this 
year. Not much is known 
about this sport, only that it 
is something like playing 
football with a hard pancake 
and that players had better be 
in pretty fair shape. Should 
be a very welcome addition as 
the sport gai n ' in popularit v. 

It doesn't take a great deal 
of effort to gather up a few 
friends and put together a 
team, 1M coordinators say. 
Probably the hardest thing 
that the at hletes face prior to 
competition is the choice of a 
team name, which usually 
has the lass of a drunken 
bum.

But does t his also apply to 
medical care? 

Accordi ng to San Diego 
attorney Dennis P. Dorman , 
people have traditionally not 
questioned the opinions of 
their doctors, or the process 
of undergoing medical care. 

"Because of blind faith or 
intimidat ion by medical 
professionals, people ha ve too 
often moved ahead with 
certain ty pes of medical 
care," he says. "When 
someth ing goes wrong , 
through, they run to their 
attorney to file a malpractice 
case."

subject. 

Scheduled for 7-10 p.m. 
Tuesdays, Sept. 22-NO\ . 17, 
in Room 1110 of the 
Psychology & Linguistic .... 
Building on Muir campus , 
the class is I itled "The RighI s 
of Health Carc Consumers" 
and costs $95. 

Registration is now open, 
and in addition to m mbers of 
the general public, the class 
is design d for healt h care 
professionals . including 
registered nurses who can 
obtain 30 hours of relicensure 
credit for at tending. 

Dorman notes that 
medicine is probably the 
second largest industry in the 
US in terms of dollars spent, 
and that "as with any 
bus iness decis ion - because 
there is a great deal of money 
involved here - people need 
to be informed and able to 
make a good busines s 
decision_ " 

He also believes that many 
health care professionals 
have not been trained to 
expect queries from their 
patients and usually don't 
pend time to thoroughly 

explain all the legal 
implications and alterna-
tives. 

In his UCSD Extension 
course, Dorman will speak on
