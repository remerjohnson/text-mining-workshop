Man Shot by UCSD Police 
Over winter break burglar reportedly approached two 
officers with kitchen knives and dared them to shoot him 
By LAURIN I. COMINIY 
News Editor 

Timothy Joseph O'Keefe, a convicted stalker 
and registered sex offender, was shot by two 
UCSD campus police officers the day after 
Christmas when he allegedly broke into an 
unoccupied Marshall apartment. He later 
pleaded innocent from his Scripps hospital bed 
at his arraignment Dec. 29. 

O'Keefe, a 45-year-old white male, allegedly 
broke into the unoccupied apartment at 
approximately 10:50 p.m. on Dec. 26. 
Neighbors spotted him crawling into the win-
dow and alened the police. When the police 
arrived, O'Keefe ran Ollt of 'the apartment and 
back in before returning outside with two 
kitchen knives. At that point, O'Keefe told the 
officers "You'll have to shoot me" and lunged at 
them with the knives. 

The officers each fired ont' shot, wounding 
O'Keefe in the right hand and chest. 

O'Keefe is a San Diego local and has often 
run aground of the law on local college cam-
puses both prior to and after the 10 years he 

spent in prison. O'Keefe served 10 years in 
Vacaville after his arrest for burglary and prowl-
ing on the Point Loma Nazarene College cam-
pus. He was paroled to San Diego in 1998 and 
was the subject of a Jan. 27, 2000 police brief-
ing at lJCSD. 

"We received a bulletin in January of 2000 
from Point Lorna that this is an individual who 
frequents local colleges; said UCSD Police 
Sergeant Jeff Cox who noted that he was not 
aware of any incidents at UCSD related to 
O'Keefe. "But we've had no personal contacts 
with him." 

Cox also said that the tenant of the apart-
ment is female but that it was not known if 
O'Keefe knew her. 

"We don't know what his intention was that 
night: said Cox. 

Lieutenant Ray Sigwalt heads the San Diego 
Police Department's Homicide Unit 

"My gut feeling is probably that it is more 
than meets the eye: Sigwalt said. "He has a his-
tory. This was not random."

UCSDto 
Receive Science 
Institute, Davis 
Announces 
University partners with 
UCI and local businesses 
By LAUREN I. COARTNEY 
News Editor 

Gov. Gray Davis announced at a press con-
ference Dec. 7 that UCSD, in partnership with 
UC Irvine, will receive an Institute for 
Telecommunications and Information 
Technology, as one of three California 
Institutes of Science and Information. 

"Cal-(IT2) will seek to merge the twin mar-
vels of the Internet and wi reless communica-
tions to forge the new information age," said 
Chancellor Robert Dynes. 

Researchers and students working with the 
Institute and its partner UCI will study modes 
of transformation from the use of slower 
modems to faster broadband Internet connec-
tions as the Internet becomes more a part of 
the physical world. 

"The enormous span of activity that is 
going to take place at this institute is really 
mind-boggling; said UCI Chancellor Ralph]. 
Cicerone, who commended not only the part-
nership between the two universities, but also 
between the universities and their contributing 
business partners. "It's going to go all the way 
from basic materials, science and the creation 
of electronic and physical devices, all the way 
thrOllgh to social politics and policies and 
management techniques.' 

The institute is expected by many to charge 
California's .economy, much like the Silicon 
Valley has done in the nonhern half of the state. 

"I believe the governor's initiative will 
demonstrate that old maxim 'We'll come 
around again' because where California goes, 
so goes the nation and ultimately, goes the 
world; Dynes said. 

Six UC campuses competed for the insti-
tutes, but only three received them. UCSD 
won because of a proposal it submitted in July. 
Winning means that the California legislature 
will allocate $100 million over four years to 
develop the project. 

Davis demanded that the individual win-

Ecology Professor Mullin' Passes Away at 63 
Scripps oceanography researcher dies as a result of problems after surgery 
By I1IVI LIIIrONIN 
Staff Writer 

Michael Mahlon Mullin , a 
research .biologist at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography and 
undergraduate professor at UCSD, 
died Dec. 19, 2000, in La Jolla of 
complications following surgery. 
He was 63. 

Mullin was a husband, father, 
grandfather and administra tor 
and leaves a legacy rich with the 
pursuit of ethics and academia. 

His research over the past 36 
years at Scripps has included the 
study of phytoplankton. zooplank-
ton and larval fish in the marine 

food web. 
Colleagues closest to him 

described Mullin as carrying a 
quiet and compassionate 
demeanor. Professor Paul K. 
Dayton co-taught an upper-divi-
sion marine ecology class with 
Mullin . 
â€¢ "He was a quiet man with a 

genuine passion for science; 
Dayton said. "Yet he was quick to 
point Out that mere passion is not 
adequate. The lasting memory that 
he leaves was his emphasis that 
science can never be subordinate 
to morals." 

Professor Robert Hessler reiter-
ated Dayton's fct:lings on Mullin's 

strong moral fiber. 
"He was an unusually fine per-

son with a strong sense of social 
obligation that was truly 
admirable,' Hessler said. "He took 
his jobs because of their impor-
tance." 

Dayton and Hessler also spoke 
of Mullin's respect for nature, har-
mony and the educational process. 
Mullin's conspicuous commit-
ment to the undergraduate instill-
ment of knowledge proved to be 
his most prominent academic fea-
ture. 

Because the Scripps Institution 
of Ocean!Jgraphy is a graduate 
program at UCSD, professors of 

the institution are under no com-
mitment to teach undergraduate 
classes. 

Yet Mullin believed that infor-
mation should be made avai lable 
to ' undergraduates as well. 
Associate professor Douglas H. 
Bartlett confirmed this. 

"He was a real gentleman, an 
effective administrator and deeply 
interested in reaching out to 
undergraduate students. He made 
the commitment to making the 
trip up the hill ." 

Mullin was the author of over 
70 scientific publications, includ-

Internet: 
Facilities will house the 
center at UCSD and UCI 
Continued from page 1 
ning universities match the govern-
ment funds two-to-one with outside 
resources. However, each university's 
chancellor ma'naged to garner a 
three-to-one match for their school 
with most of the money coming from 
the private sector and businesses sur-
rounding the individual campuses. 

"This is a proud day for 
California," Davis said . "These centers 
of science and innovation will not just 
be portals to the new economy, they 
will be the pilots of the new economy." 

In addition to the announcement 
of VCS D 's new center, Davis also 
announced that VCLA will receive 
the anosystems Institute and that 
UCSF will receive the Bioengineering, 
Biotechnology and Quantitative 
Biomedicine Institute. 

"I believe that our proposal suc-
ceeded because VCSD and UCI are 
in th e right place at the right time," 
Dynes said. "The southern California 
corridor between our campuses is 
home to some of the world's leading 
high- tech pioneers." 

UCSD has over 40 industry part-
ners in the institute, including the 
Boeing Company, Qualcomm 
Incorporated, Ericsson Wireless 
Communications, Inc., Texas 
Instruments, Compaq and Microsoft 
Corporation. 

"We at Ericsson believe that 
research conducted bi, the various 
pa rtners of the Cal-(IT ) program will 
help ensure California's continued 
global competitiveness and leadership 
in the high-tech area ," said Ericsson 
President Ake Perrson. "We are very 
proud to be a part of this institute and 
we are very proud to be a part of the 
San Diego community." 

Irwin Jacobs, chairman and CEO 
of Qualcomm, was also on hand to 
comment on his company's involve-
ment with the new center. 

"I think this center is going to make 
a major difference on the campus, to 
the industry in San Diego and up in the 
Ir.'ine area and to the nation," Jacobs 
said. "It's going to lprovide! a major 
capability of performing basic research 
in the communications area and appli-
cations that I think are really going to 
make substantial differences. We really, 
even with a good proposal, can't imag-
ine all of the interesting things that are 
going to come out of th is." 

Larry Smarr, professor of computer 
science and engineering at UCSD, wi ll 
serve as director of the new institu te. 

"Our institute's mission is simple: 
extend the reach of current informa-
tion infrastructure throughout the 
physical world, but as simple as that 
sta tement is, the research required to 
bring the new Internet into being is 
formidable," Smarr said." 0 single 
investigator could hope to study this 
emerging system in its entirety, nor 
does any single company have suffi-
cient resources to dominate the mar-
ket. That's why we need an interdisci-
plinary institute of such broad scope." 

A 215.000 square-foot building will 
be constructed at UCSD and a 119,500 
square-foot building will be construct-
ed at VCI to house the insti tute. Both 
facilities are expected to be completed 
by 2004.

O'Keefe pleaded innocent to 
the charges filed against him 
Contlnueel from ..... 1 

The officers who shot O'Keefe 
remain unidentified and have been put 
on paid administrative leave. The 
District Attorney's office will conduct 
an investigation to determine whether 
the shooting was warranted, as is stan-
dard procedure with all shootings 
involving police. 

O'Keefe is charged with residential 
burglary and assault with a deadly 
weapon and faces a 2S-to-life sentencr 
under Callfomia's 111ret: St;ikes Law if 
conVIcted. After his release from the

American Geophysical Union Dec . 17. 

Reid was recognized for his numerous contri-
butions to ocean science. 

The award is given annually for exhibited 
excellence in the understanding of physical, geo-
physical and geological processes in the ocean. 
Reid has been a member of the faculty at 
Scripps since 1974, serving first as professor of 
physical oceanography before going on to

Indian oceans. 

UCSD r .... rchers find new 
central n.rvous syst.m g.ne 

Researchers from the UCSD School of 
Medicine and the ShirakaWa Institute of Animal 
Genetics in Japan have discovered a new gene 
responsible for development and function in the 
central nervous system. 

The research team described its discovery of 
a protein called "NUDEL" in the December 2000 
issue of the journal "Neuron.Â· NUDEL combines 
with a protein called L1S1 to form a transport 
complex that helps carry neural messages from 
a newborn's just-formed brain to the rest of its 
body. This discovery may help scientists solve 
the mystery of how an egg specifically becomes 
a human being. 

The team's findings may also help doctors 

cure or prevent human defects that occur during 
the neural migration process, such as epilepsy 
and schizophrenia. 

Scientists also learned that the NUDEL/L1S1 
complex may be partly responsible for cell divi-
Sion, proliferation and survival. 

Board of R.g.nts appoints 
commission to aid In growth 

UC Regents Chair S. Sue Johnson and UC 
President Richard Atkinson announced last 
month the selection of the Commissioll on the 
Growth and Support of Graduate Education com-
posed of faculty, students and administrators to 
help the UC system reach its goal of adding 
11,000 graduate students in the next 10 years. 

The commission will have to produce a report 
by summer concerning the necessary actions ' 
the l!niversity should take to increase enroll-
ments and admissions for the additional gradu-
ate students. 

A large 'number of graduate students are 
required at the university to assist with impor-
tant research and boost the number of employ-
ees at the school. 

The commission comes from the determina-
tion made by the regents earlier this year to 
enroll more students to remain competitive in 
California's economy. 

UCSD scientists discover 
hydrothermal v.nt field 

A team of scientists, consisting of members 
from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
Duke University, the University of Washington 
and various other institutions found a new 
hydrothermal vent field Dec. 5 in the Atlantic 
ocean which they are calling "The Lost City.' 

The field was discovered while the scientists 
were studying a mountain at that location during 
a scientIfic cruise aboard the research vessel 
Atlantis. 

The scientists say that this may be the 
largest system of its kind with the underwater 
structures riSing 180 feet. They also note thllt it 
is unusual because the venting structures are 
made of carbonate materials and silica rather 
than sulta and jron-based materials.

PINION 

Due to a serious lack of diversity on UC campuses, affinnative 
action needs to be reinstated for a better environment 

By ALEX J. LEE 
Senior Staff Writer 

As UCSD students begin yet another 
quarter at our fine university, they will 
endure a second onslaught of tests, 
midterms and fi nals, Amid all the drama and 
excitement that typify college, I begin to 
wonder how many students take time to 
truly reflect on the process in which many 
of them were granted admittance, 

Because of the passing of Proposition 
209 a few years back, many of today's stu-
dents have not had to worry about dealing 
first-hand with the effects of affirmative 
action, Si nce 1995, the debate over the 
legitimacy of affi rmative action has raged, 
fueled mostly by conservatives such as Pete 
Wilson, Di nesh D'souza and Ward Con-
nerly, though many so-ca lled liberals, too, 
have been vocal members of the opposi-
tion , 

Many opponents of affirmative action in 
California bring up the fa miliar argument 
that such practices are racist and support a 
form of "reverse discrimination," wherein 
certain more qualified students get denied 
admittance to UC schools over less quali-
fied minority students, They go on to argue 
that even though, admissions boards may no 
longer maintai n speci fic racial quotas when 
deciding who to accept and who to deny, 
they are still unfairly influenced by a racial 
agenda. . 

The case of Rege nts of the University 
of California v, Bakke in 1978 is often 
cited by affi rmative action cri ti cs to sup-
port their stance. In it, Allan Bakke sued 
the University of California for twice 
denying him admi ttance to the UC Davis 
School of Medicine, According to Bakke, 
although his test scores were higher than 

many of the minority applicants the 
school admitted, he was still rejected 
because he was white. 

Ultimately, the case went to the Supreme 
Court in which the justices ruled 5 to 4 that 
UC should admit Bakke. The decision fur-
ther states that schools cannot use racial 
quotas in determining who they accept. 
However it leaves open the practice of con-
sidering race in admissions to encourage 
diversity. 

While I agree with the notion that stu-
dents should be judged by their own merits, 
I also recognize that we do not live in a per-
fect world - that is, judging students on an 
even playing field, the fact of the matter is 
that everyone is not on an even playing 
field . To assume that would be a naive and 
misguided attempt to ignore all the inequal-
ity that exists in our society today. This is 
where the case against affirmative action is 
weakest. 

Too often affirmative action has suffered 
from being overly scrutinized for the moral 
and ethical issues that it raises. What is 
often forgotten in the debate are the systems 
of discrimination that created a need for 
such a program in the first place. For oppo-
nents to suggest tha t ad missions boards 
judge a person solely by their own merits as 
if we were all equal would be a dire mistake; 
it conveniently implies that our society is 
and has always been cured of the prevailing 
disease known as racism, Unfortunately, 
this simply is not the case. 

Historically, groups of people have been 
disenfranchised and marginalized in 
numerous institutions excl usively on the 
basis of their race, Affirmative action should 
be seen more as a necessary, albeit fl awed,

Affirmative action, though honorable in goal, is the wrong 
solution to bring minorities to campus 
By VAL!RI! IURNS 
Staff Writer 

Ah, affirmative action. Those two 
words can; get anyone w~o is otherwise 
happily sedated pretty riled up. How you 
feel about that famous term supposedly 
exposes the very beliefs that inhabit your 
being .. . or at least many believe it should 
be that way. Many believe affirmative 
action can only be debated morally. This 
thought, however, is now too trite for 
polite conversation. 

Overall, society now is pro-diversity, pro-
integration. Currently, the relevance of affir-
mative action is not in regards to its objec-
tive, but to its practicality, which is far from 
adequate. Althoug~ minority percentages at 
UCSD as well as other UC campuses have 
dropped off, the solution is not the rein-
statement of affirmative action . 

Affirmative action's objective is to inte-
grate the minorities of American society 
into the upper ranks of the professional 
workforce. Through quotas in the state uni-
versity systems, as well as in state govern-
ment, minorities were going to move from 
lower-class ranks to the middle and upper 
classes through the elitist educational sys-
tem that in fact put them where they origi-
nally were. 

This all makes sense, to a certain point. If 
carefully examined though, affirmative 
action does not try to solve the problem of 
race and class separation. It just works 
around it, using the exact same system to let 
a few privileged minorities go to college. 

The practicality argument against affir-
mative action can be examined from many 
different angles. Affirmative action essen-
tially put many minority students in 
extremely challengi ng academic environ-

ments for which they were not prepared. My 
stepbrother went to UC Berkeley in the late 
80's, and in two years he had five African-
American roommates. They each flunked 
out. They were not prepared. 

A friend, Monique, put it best when she 
said, "It's not easy catching up when you 
are already 12 years behind." Many 
minorities admitted under affirmative 
action were' essentially 12 years behind 
due to the quality - or lack tHereof - of 
education they had preceding their 
entrance into college. 

First, it is not fair to the unprepared 
minorities. Let me add that I'm not saying 
that all minorities cO,!,ing to UCs were 
unprepared. Second, it was also extremely 
impractical. Those spots could have been 
given to students capable of such academic 
rigors who were not accepted because of 
affirmative action. Affirmative action by skin 
color reinforces institutional racism in the 
United States. 

[t lias come to my atfention that the 
main issue at hand, the one that can deter-
mine a student's acceptance to universities, 
is the quality of his or her schooling before-
hand. There is a disproportionate amount 
of UC students who come from private 
schools. That makes one question the qual-
ity of public schools, 

[ pride myself on coming from a public 
school. It was not until the other day that I 
realized that my public school, was not real-
ly that, well, public. Although there was a 
four-year window, ironically while I was 
there, during which open enrollment was 
allowed, students had to live in its district 
the other 23 years of its existence. The high 
school I attended sits in a very elite, mostly

Life is full of irony, isn't it? The 

holidays are supposed to be a time 
of joyous celebration. W~II , my 
holidays were of no such thmgs, to 
say the least. True, I do not cele-
brate Christmas, but I still got a few 
gifts. Some dress shirts, a J. Crew tie 
and a bottle of Issey Miyake 
cologne. Great gifts; I like them all , 
especially the cologne. I've been 
meaning to buy it for a while no~. 
It has this light citrus smell to I~. 
But in light of another present, It 
altseems so ... futile. 
_ Santa Claus was generous 

enough to deliver his gift for my 
entire family early this year. Jt 
came in the wee morning of 
Christmas Eve (at 3 a.m. actually, 
as opposed to later that night) . 
Not a thing was stirring, not even 
a mouse, when the phone ca ll 
ruptured the silence. 

I stumbled to bed only an hour 
before my uncle called. Brrrng! 
Brrrng! My eyes popped open. 
Brrrng! Brrrng! My mother 
picked up the phone. A few mm-
utes later, I could hear her hang it 
up, 

My father woke me up in the 
morning to inform me of Santa's 
gift. But he didn't have to. I'm no 
fool - I knew exactly what the news 

' was, The entire family, for almost a 
. yea r, knew this present would 

eventually arrive , And like a lump 
of black coal, none of us. were anx-
iOlls to get it. 

It doesn 't take a fourth-year 
English Literature wi th an 
emphasis in Asian-American 
works to ascertain that there was 
a death in the family. My paternal 
grandfather passed away Christ-
mas Eve, 

He was a whopping 92, almost , 
93, He had been sick for almost a 
year, in and out of the hospital a 
couple of times, This time, his 
kidneys failed him. He left behind 
a slew of daughters and sons, 
grandchi ldren and even great-
grandchildren , 

My two brothers and I were his, 
as the Vietnamese 'saying goes, 
"cream nugget: or "cream-filled 
center." Vietnamese pastries are 
often filled with a sweet paste or 
cream, and what the idiom basical-
ly means is that my siblings and I 
were his favorite grandchildren. 

We came to the United States 
when we wen: very young and were 
able to make the most of it: We are, 
more or less, successful in our 
lives. We went, or in my case still 
go, to pre5tigious schools and have, 
in my brothers' cases, thriving 
careers. [f vou were Asian, or at 
least Vietnamese, you would 
understand the importance of this 
to grandparents, 

Despite this bestowal of pride 
on the three of us, we were never 
close with him, I do not have a lot 
of memories of interaction 
between my grandfather and 
myself. I do distinctly remember 
one, though, Bear with me as I 
retell it. 

When I was younger, my family 
would often drive from Sacramen-

Without a program like affir-

sys tem that only serves to further 
polarize and segregate our soci-
ety. In many ways, this is precise-
ly what has happened over the 
past few years at UC campuses, 
as well as colleges across the 
nation . Minorities in general are 
increasingly absent from most 
student populations, particularly 
in elite colleges. UC Berkeley and 
UCLA have suffered from a lack

white neighborhood. 

A lot of the funding that goes 
to local public schools comes 
from property taxes. The revenue 
generated from this tax is essen-
tially what the children of that 
area will have access to in terms 
of academic resources. So, 
although my high school was 
public and in the same school 
district as high schools in poorer 
neighborhoods, my parents' 
money was not put into a general 
fund fo r the district, but was 
instead funneled directly back to 
my high school. 

In order for UCs to be more 
diverse, things have to change in 
the Cali fornia public education 
system. Elitism is a dangerous 

of more diversity as a result of 
prop 209 and its subsequent 
abolishment of affirmative action 
in state programs .. UCSD is def-
initely no exception in this 
regard. 

At a recent Graduate Diver-
sity Conference hosted by 
UCLA , Patricia Gurin, a profes-
sor at the University of Michigan 
and one of the state 's expert wit-
nesses in an affirmative action 
suit against the university, 
expressed the crucial role pro-
grams such as affirmative action 
play in society. 

"Knowledge is not just what 
you think or what you know, but 
how you think and how you dis-
cover new information. This is 
affected by diversity:' Gurin said. 

Diversity should not necessari-
ly be the narrow goal of affirmative 
action, but more of a positive 

thing when not controlled, and 
even more dangerous when 
enforced by the government. 

The class of 2002 at UCSD 
was the first class to be admitted 
not using affirmative action . 
There has been a significant 
drop in minorities being accept-
ed and subsequently enrolling at 
UCSD. The Diversity Council at 
UCSD is trying to change that. 
Chaired by Chancellor Dynes, it 
strives to do what affirmative 
action did in the past: provide a 
diverse learning atmosphere for 
UCSD students. 

Fortunately, the Diversity 
Cou~cil is digging at the root of 
the problem. With the absence of 
affirmative action, it is brain-
storming how to get more minori-
ties in to our eucalyptus-nested 
university. Ideas that have been ' 
submitted include: less weight on 
SAT scores, not taking into 
account grade inflation by more

byproduct. The true goal of affir-
mative action and the reason it 
should be reinstated in the UC 
system has always been social jus-
tice. We can no longer live in a 
"color-blind" society, pretending 
that race and socio-economic sta-
~us do not matter in today's Amer-
Ica. 

[t is time we remind ourselves 
that race does matter regardless 
of how much we buy into the lie 
that we are all equal, or at least 
treated as such. 

Affirmative action, or some 
form of it, will always be neces-
sary so long as we live in a soci-
ety that continues to create 
inequalities between a majority 
that is content to maintain the 
status quo and a minority that 
struggles to conform to the 
mainstream majority social and 
cultural faction . 

high schools, and creating more 
academic scholarships. Currently, 
UCSD offers the least amount of 
these among UC schools. The 
Diversity Council believes that 
once minorities feel welcome at 
UCSD again, and numbers build 
up, there will be a snowball effect 
and UCSD will return to its for-
mer diverse self. 

There is no disagreement that 
the ultimate objective of affirma-
tive action, increased diversity, is 
good. The method to bring this 
about is what is currently being 
argued. The UCSD Diversity 
Council is moving in the right 
direction. But, it cannot succeed 
alone. There needs to be major 
reconstruction of the California 
public education system to pro-
vide educated minorities to UCs. 
With the combined effort of both 
these organizations, diversity at 
the university and professional 
level in California can be 
achieved.

Editor: 
[ write to you with great con-

cern and disappojntment regard-
ing your Nov. 14 article on the 
perceived lack of political activity 
at UCSD during this past ,election . 
A profoundly large number of stu-
dents played key, active roles in 
this current election cycle. Politi-
cal groups on campus flourished 
with the heightened awareness 
that the election brought. Thou-
sands of students registered to 
vote on campus and showed up to 
the polls on Election Day, yet the 
Guardian, for whatever reason, 
failed to report on such activities. 

With a current membership of 

over ISO, the College Democrats 
at UCSD organized and mobilized 
an unprecedented political aware-
ness campaign on campus this 
past year. The College Democrats 
began a voter registration cam-
paign at the beginning of fall 
quarter and registered students to 
vote on Library Walk every day for 
nearly a month straight. The Col-
lege Republicans and Students for 
Nader also participated in suc-
cessful voter registration efforts. 

We at the College Democrats 
were able to register over 1,300 
students, faculty and staff. Resi-
dent Advisors, student organiza-
tions and even professors asked 
representatives of the different 
political organizations to speak at 
various voter information ses-
sions. 

A number of UCSD students 
were even hired by various local 
candidates and issue-camp'aigns 
during this past election cycle. 
And yet, the GutlTdian, fully aware 
that these activities were occur-
ring, failed to report on any of 
these highly visible and important 
events. 

There we.re a number of politi-
cal rallies and activities at UCSD 
during this past election cycle as 
well . UCSD was a particular hot 
spot, attracting local, national and 
international press coverage of the 
various events it held. 

The College Democrats 
brought author and activist Gloria 
Steinem, now Congresswoman 
Susan Davis, and now Assembly-
woman Christine Kehoe to UCSD 
for a lunch-time rally. The A.S. 
Council sponsored a debate 
between congressional candidates

Although 1 was not in the least 
as benevolent as Mother Teresa 
when I was in Delhi, [ tried my 
best to make amends for my arro-
gance by slipping those children 
money and chocolate when my 
relatives weren't looking. But if [

my sins, [ certainty thought [

or say to and the second was that 
the pilot of the craft which held 
nine people, including me, 
excused himself out of the cockpit 
to:- get 'a newspaper and a sand-
Wich . 

My goal of wowing the Dalai 
Lama with an eloquent vocabulary 
changed as the turbulence rolled 
and shook the aircraft (while the 
pilot caught up with the latest news

getting the chance to see the Dalai 
Lama while [ was still alive. As the 
plane finaUy landed on the thin 
airstrip set in the middle of a field 
(we had to circle around a few times 
because a stray dog had parked 
itself on the "runway"), I became 
giddy with excitement. 

Not only would I impress the 
Dalai Lama with my excellent ver-
bal and written skills but my inter-
view with him would bl:! so 
thought-provoking and ground-
breaking that I would no doubt 
impress my editors and t:Ventually 
win the Pulitzer Prize. My hopes 
were dashed however as soon as I 
set foot in Dharamsala when some-
one gently broke the news to me 
that the Dalai Lama was on vaca-
tion and would return a few days 
after I was scheduled to return to 
Delhi (providing I survived the 
plane ride back home). 

So much for spiritual enlight-
enment. Yet, even without meeting 
the Dalai Lama, I felt [ learned a 
lot while walking the same paths

buckets of water, but I survived. 
There were difficult times, of 

course. Me walking in on my 
grandmother taking a shower was 
quite troubling, and when I 
became sick and had to use the 
restroom numerous times, the 
tlleories and discussions about my 
condition by various people out-
side the' door were quite irritating 
as well. But I suppose this is what 
the journey of life is all about (if I 
can attempt to sound philosophi-
cal for a moment): good moments 
and bad moments and several in-
between moments. 

When I got back to Delhi, I got 
over the fact that in the end, after 
much hoopla, [ nt:Ver did end up 
meeting the famed Buddhist spiri-
tUflI leader. I had, in fact, met so 
many other people who had 
taught me a lot about Buddhism 
and a humble existence that [ 
often hear little about in my envi-
ronment here. Although, inter-
viewing him wouldn't have looked 
too shabby on 'a resume.

The A.S. Council sponsored a

and noble attempt to raise stu-
dent political awareness and par-
ticipation on campus. 

On Election Day, the College 
Democrats organized nearly 100 
students wearing bright yellow t-
shirts and placed them through-
out campus and in phone banks 
encouragillg students to vote and 
be part of the process. As a result 
of our mobilization efforts, there 
was a dramatic increase in on-
campils voter turnout compared 
to previous election cycles. 

And yet, the Guardian claims 
that there was no political activity 
on campus and that student 
turnout was nearly nonexistent. 
To say that political activity 
lacked on campus is simply false 
statement and an indication that 
the Guardian is desperately out of 
touch with the pulse of the stu-
dent body. Instead of filling your 
pages with claims that left-wing 
bigots are running rampant 
throughout campus, 1 would 
encourage your writers and edi-
torial staff in the future to report 
on the long hours and positive 
work that the various student 
political organizations devote 
toward breaking the stereotype of 
youth apathy toward the political 
process. 

The students of UCSD 
should be commended for their 
participation in this past election. 
Whether they simply made it out 
to the poll on Election Day, or 
sacrificed cou ntless hours 
toward an issue they were pas-

Some Scientists Say Antibiotic Use in. 
Livestock Higher than Industry Reports 

Antibiotics an: being used far 
more Ilcavily in pigs, cows and 
chickens than has been revealed 
by the drug and livestock indus-
tries, a public interest group was 
expect.:d to announce Monday, 
citing as evidence its own calcula-
tions d the drugs' use on farms. 

The Issue is of concern becallse 
healthy iarm animals are routinely 
fed antibiotics to promote growth 
and prevent infections. That prac-

tlC~ can breed strains of drug-
resistant bacteria, which can infect 
people who eat contaminated meat 
or come into contact with food or 
water contaminated by the ani-
mals' droppings. 

The estimates of antibiotic usc 
appear in a 109-page report by the 
Union of Concerned Scientists, a 
nonprofit group based in 
Cambridge, Mass., that advocates 
less usc of the drugs in agriculture. 

A trade group representing 
drug makers has disputed the 
findings, which are 40 percent 
higher than industry estimates. 

Government scientists said 
that regardless of who is right, the 
conflicting figures highl ight a seri-
ous problem: the glaring lack of 
re liable information about the 

Researchers said that 
information is essential 
for tracking the 
emergence of resistant 
bacteria and 
detennining whether it 
correlates with patterns 
amou nts and types of antibiotics 
used in livestock in different parts 
of the country. Researchers sa id 
that information is essential for 
tracking the emergence of resis-
tant bacteria and determin ing 
whether it correlates with patterns 
of antibiotic use, which could 
then be changed. 

The FDA will hold meetings 
Jan. 22-24 to discuss antibiotic 
use in livestock, and Margaret 
Mellon, an author of the Union of 
Concerned Scientists' report and 
the director of the group's food 
and environment program, 
ackntlwledged in an interview that 
the report was timed to influence 
regulators and policy makers. 

American livestock producers 
have said the drugs are essentia l if. 

they are to produce safe and 
affordable meat and poultry. 

According to Mellon's report, 
American livestock producers use 
about 24.6 million pounds of 
antibiotics a year just for "nonther-
apeutic" purposes, meaning 
gro~ promotion and disease pre-
vention, as opposed to therapeutic 
use, which means the treatment of 
disease. The non therapeutic total 
includes about 10.3 million 
pounds in hogs, 10.5 million 
pounds in poultry and 3.7 million 
pounds in cattle. 

Carole DuBois, a spokes-
woman for the Animal Health 
Institute, said it had not seen the 
Union of Concerned Scientists' 
report, but said, "[ find it very dif-
ficult to believe their numbers are 
so. different from ours." 

Mellon said that rather -than 
rely on industry figures, she and 
her colleagues deye\oped their 
own. met~ods for estimating drug 
use. In antmals, based on publicly 
avatlable data on herd sizes, drug 
doses and recommended uses of 
the drugs.

Ecuador Braces for More Violence 
From Colombia's Drug War 

LAGO AGR IO, Ecuador -
Every . (ountry bordering 
Colombia fears that as the conflict 
there worsens and U.S. involve-
ment grows, violence and coca 
cultiva tion will spill across the 
front ier into their territOlY. But in 
this dingy Amazon border town , 
that dreaded scenar'o has already 
become a reality.

backed anti-drug offensive the 
Colombian government is to 
begin soon, affluent Colombians 
with no tics to this area are sud-
denly buying. up land and stocking 
up on chemica ls used to process

Of all of Colombia's neighbors, 
Ecuador is perhaps the most vul-
ner,lble, least prepared and worst 
equipped to deal with such devel-
opmenls.

"If Colombia is going to be

keeps saying, then Ecuador is 
going to become the Cambodia of

the mayor here, warned. "We are

a bomb exploded in an attack on

~ource of Ecuador's export earn-
mgs. 

Unlike Venezuela and Brazil, 
the Ecuadorean government has 
closely aligned itself with the 
anti-drug offensive through 
such measures as setting up an 
American drug surveillance base 
in the coastal city of Manta, which 
FARC leaders have said they con-
sider "a declaration of war."

themselves. :

Drugs: 
McCaffrey admitted that 
drug use elicits revulsion 
ContIMed rro. .... 1 
step down Jan . 6 as the 
WhiteHouse director of national 
drug control policy. 

McCaffrey, a professional sol-
dier, refused to accept the 
metaphor of a war on drugs. 
Beginning with his Senate confir-
mation hearings in early 1996, the 

r~tired four-star general has 
"kened America's drug problem to 
a cancer that must be treated. 

McCaffrey called it "silly' for 
laws to impose harsher penalties 
for selling or possessing crack 
cocaine than for powder cocaine 
because they are the same drug. 

And most nonviolent addicts 
behind bars, he said, belong in 
treatment centers, not in prison. 

The solution to drug abuse and 
its $11 0 billion annual conse-
quen<:es. he said, is "to engage in a 
more coherern, rational way the 
chronically addicted as we encounter 
them 1n our communities. " 

"If you want to save taxpayer 
dollars, and you want to reduce 
violence in your communities, if 
you want to accomplish all of these 
larger social goals, you have to 
draw them into. effective drug 
treatment," McCaffrey said, 

McCaffrey conceded that

provinces. His approval ratings 
dropped from 70 percent to 50 per-
cent, and his image abroad was 
battered by ~is mi.sstep in handling 
the AIDS epIdemiC and the politi-
cal troubles in neighboring 
Zimbabwe. 

But in recent weeks, Mbeki has 
taken pains to remind South 
Africans of his successes. rn a New 
Year's Eve address, he pointed to 
the s.lowly strengthening economy 
and Improved results on national 
education tests. And on Sunday he 
celebrated his party's victory in last 
month's local elections, where the 
ANC easily won 60 percent of the 
vote. 

"Even as we went for local gov-
ernment elections, there were some 

s~ying that the people have grown. 
tired of the ANC," Mbeki told an 
ANC rally in the mining town 'of 
Kimberley. 

"We must show these people 
who want the ANC to die that the 
ANC lives, that the ANC leads," 
Mbeki said. "Let us disappoint 
them by doing the work we have to 

addict had been a hard sell on 
Capitol Hill and elsewhere. 

"That's the argument that has 
to be made to state legislatures and 
county councils," he said. "Then 
we've got to tell the health insur-
ance industry: ' Look, you 're going 
to pay for it one way or another. 
You can pay for it in the emergency 
room, you can pay for it with a lot 
less dollars in drug treatment cen-
ters.'u 

But ~e . acknowledged that drug 
abuse ehclted more revulsion than 
sympathy from the majority of 
Americans. 

"They get a better feel for it 
when it's their son or daughter, or 
their mother," McCaffrey said. 

Since McCaffrey took office, 
federal funding has increased by 55 
percent for prevention - programs 
and by 34 percent for treatment 
programs. 

The bulk of the government's 
~rug-fighting budget, which 
Jumped to $19.2 billion in the cur-
rent fiscal year from $13 .5 billion 
in 1996, is still spent on drug inter-
diction and law enforcement. 

Even as he leaves the White 
House, McCaffrey continued to 
challenge the perception of a lost 
war on drugs, which he said was 
fueled by " a very deliberate, well-
thought-out strategy by drug 
legalization forces" seeking public 
resignation to drug use.

do to give our people a better life." 
Over the past few months, the 

president has responded to criti -
cism, most notably withdrawing 
from the AIDS. debate after stir-
ring controversy by questioning 
whether the human immunodefi-
ciency virus, or H[V, causes 
AIDS. 

He has sharply condemned the 
continuing invasions of white-
owned farms in Zimbabwe by 
black residents seeking land 
reform. And in No.vember, before 
the local elections, he started visit-
ing poor communities, countering 
criticism that he had become 
remote from the concerns of ordi-
nary people. 

rn an editorial on Sunday, The 
Sunday Independent noted his 
government's mistakes but praised 
Mbeki for adopting realistic macro-
economic and monetary policies 
and for moving to relax labor laws 
that businesses have repeatedly 
described as bl,lrdensome. 

"On the economic front there is a 
lot to be proud of," the editorial said. 
"On the domestic front there have 
been some encouraging signs that 
the consolidation of our new-found 
democracy is gaining momentum."

Locals Donate Money to UCSD 
Judith and Jack White give sum to go toward cardiology 
., â€¢ .,DlmllCH 
Contributing News Writer 

The cardiology division of 
UCSD's School of Medicine 
received a holiday gift of its own 
Dec. 20 when local philan-
thropists Judith and Jack White 
donated $1.1 million to create 
the Judith and Jack White chair 
in cardiology. 

The donation, upon its ratifi-
cation by the UCSD Academic 
Senate, will be the largest of its 
kind in UCSD history. 

Â·"We trust the institution and 
its people," White said. "We nope 
our contributions will give more 
resources for faculty to pursue 
opportunities to address the 
problems of heart disease." 

T he gift brought immediate 
praise frOl., UCSD officials, who 
said the d()nation would provide 
welcome support for UCSD's 
educational and research pro-
grams in cardiac medicine . . 
- "Their endowment will bene-
fit th~ lJ1illions who suffer from 
the devastating effects of heart 
diseas~ by advancing our efforts 
to improve prevention and treat-
ment of the nation's No. 1 killer," 
said cardiologist Dr. Anthony 
DeMaria , chief of the division of 
cardiology. 

For the Whites. who have 
been involved with the UCSD 
Cardiovascular Center for four 
years and sit on the center's 
Board of Directors, the donation 
had personal implications. 

"This endowment is in 

honor of our family members 
who have had heart diseases," 
White said. The Whites have 
lost relatives to heart disease, 
including Judith's father who 
was an internal medicine physi-
cian who specialized in cardiol-
ogy. 

The Whites believe in 
endowments because they 
directly help UCSD in attracting 
and supporting the best doctors

contributions will give

Local philanthropist 

and researchers, such as 
DeMaria, who also serves as 
preside nt of the American 
College of Cardiology and of the 
American Society of 
Echocardiology. 

DeMaria is held in the highest 
esteem by the Whites, who stat-
ed, "We have great regard for Dr. 
DeMaria personally and profes-
sionally. We also have a great 

â€¢ regard for the tremendous 
research he performs in cardiolo-
gy at UCSD." 

The endowed chair will help 

UCSD researchers with support 
for their projects. 

Specifically, the endowed 
chair will help support the pro-
jects of UCSD researchers such 
as DeMaria, who is developing 
less invasive ways to measure 
coronary blood flow to the heart 
and to detect abnormalities. 

This is accol11plished by 
replacing traditional catheters 
with noninvasive gas bubbles, 
which are the size of red blood 
cells. 

The gas bubbles are inserted 
into an artery, which can then be 
used to detect problems with the 
heart. 

As UCSD's medical centers 
expand, the need to attract and 
retain the best doctors and 
researchers becomes crucial in 
creating a world-class medical 
center. UCSD is currently under-
going an expansion of its medical 
facilities, including plans to cre-
ate a cancer center and a new 
card iac center, as well as expand-
ing the Shirley Eye Center. 

The Whites have lived in la 
Jolla for over 25 years and are one 
of 83 UCS D endowed chairs. 

Philanthropists such as the 
Whites are helping raise money 
for the new centers. 

Those who wish to help fight 
heart disease may attend the 
Heart of San Diego Gala, a din-
ner dance at the U.S. Grant 
Hotel on Feb. 10. Tickets are

Collegiate: 
The yearbook's theme was 
deemed tIXJ vague 

vs. Kuhlmeier standard to college 
publications. In that decision, the 
Court ruled that high school news-
papers do not qualify as a public 
forum and that administration has 
the authority to prevent speech it 
considers against the school's edu-
cational mission. 

The case stems from the publi-
cation of the Thorobred, KSU's 
student yearbook, in an edition 
that covered the 1992-93 and 
1993-94 school years. University 
officials deemed "was not of proper 
quality and did not represent the 
school a(s) it should." The un iver-
sity locked away all 2,000 copies of 
the yearbook. 

The yearbook. featured the 
theme "Destination Unknown " 
and a purple cover. University offi-
cials cla imed the theme was vague 
and inappropriate and the cover 
d id not feature school colors, 
according to the court decision. 
Then-KSU President Mary Smith 
also objected to a lack of captions 
under photographs and the inclu-
sion of too many photographs 
depicting celebrities and current 
events, the court decision said. 

In 1995, Coffer and fellow KSU 
student Charles Kincaid filed suit 
against KSU President Mary 
Smith, Vice President for Student 
Affairs Betty Gibson, and individ-
ual members of the Board of 
Regents. Their suit alleged the vio-
lation of their First and 14th 
Amendment rights.

message to university officials,

BOULDER, Colo. - University 
of Colorado-Boulder philosophy 
student Carlos Martinez has sin-
gle-handedly tackled a team of CU 
lawyers. 

A District Court judge th is week 
reversed Martinez's permanent ban 
from campus on the grounds that it 
violated his due process rights and 
lacked merit, in what amounted to 
an abuse of university discretion. 

"Neither (the) initial expulsion 
nor the .. . review of that expUlsion 
ar( supported by competent evi-
dence and each is therefore an 
abtise of discretion ," Judge Nathan 
Hale wrote. 

Following the ruling, Martinez 
announced plans to return to CU 
to finish his degree. 

"I'm already regis tering for 
classes for the upcoming semester," 
Martinez said from CU-Boulder's 
campus on Thursday. 

Mart inez on Dec. 19 filed a civil 
suit against the university that 
states CU engaged in malicious 
prosecution and trampled on his 
rights in the process. 

"My win here adds to my case," 
Martinez said. "CU's prosecution of 
me was capricious and arbitrary." 

Not on ly did Martinez miss 
classes duri ng his expUlsion, 
which began on May 2, 2000, but 
he was also prevented from work-
ing at his job and seeing his doc-
tor for a disabi lity because those 
offices were located on the CU-
Boulder campus. 

Martinez's troubles with the uni-
versity began when a conversation 
that he initiated with the bursar's 
office over $1 30 he was over-
charged spiraled from bad to worse.

Collegiate: 
cU officials alleged that 
Martinez drove recklessly 

. ContInued from ..... 9 
Mart inez co mplained about the 
department's abi li ty to handle such 
complaints in a timely fashion. 

"It was the th ird time something 
like that had happened," M artinez 
sa id. " I complained." 

According to Martinez, he next 
encountered a new employee 
unable to assist him. 

In the dispute, CU staff, follow-
ing an inquiry led by Director of 
Judicial Affairs Andrea Goldblum, 
alleged that M artinez m ade numer-
ous offensive comments to several 
CU staff members - someth ing 
CU lawyers failed to prove beyond 
a reasonable doubt. 

CU officials also alleged that 
M artinez drove in a reckless manner 
to avoid paying a parking ticket. 

As a result, M artinez was 
ordered on Dec. 3D, 1999, banned 
from campus for a year. H is origi-
nal sanctions, not directly affected 
by the rul ing, required him to take 
anger management classes and to 
write a letter of apology to Natalie 
Gutierrez, an employee at the bur-
sar's office. 

The letter of apology becamc an 
item of contention fo r M altinez. 
Goldblum said she wanted to 
approve the letter, but M artinez 
ref'Jsed to write it because he did 
not agree that his apology nceded to 
be supervised by university officials. 

The court, though not rul ing on 
any of the original sa nctions, found 
the university ca n require a letter of 
apology. 

M arti nez must have it comple t-
ed before the end of spring semes-
ter 2001. 

Hale, In dcnying a request by 
CU lawyers, also showed little sym- . 
pathy for the university'S posi tion 
that the clock for M artinez's proba-
tion be started after the end of the 
expUlsion, which would have kept 
Martinez off campus another year. 

Judges have yet to schedule a 
hearing in M;trtinez ci vil sui t 
against CU.

Harvard Law Student 
Chosen as 'Survivor' 
Contestant 

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - What 
does it take to be a Survivor? A 
Harvard Law School student, Nick 
Brown, will have the chance to see 
whether cunning and intelligence 
are the most important ski lls. 

Brown, 23, has been chosen as a 
contestant for the second install-
ment of the wildly popular reality 
show on CBS. 

Brown, a San Francisco native, 
was a member of ROTC and is cur-
rently an officer in the U.S. Army, a 
biographical sketch provided by 
CBS said. 

He is a second-year law student 
member of the Black Law Students 
Association, according to the CBS 
biography. 

CBS Publicist Michelle Hooper 
sa id contestants are forbidden from 
giving interviews before the show 
airs. 

She decl ined com ment on 
Brown or the selection process. But 
the Survivor application says that 
excellent physicalj md mental health 
are required; all 48 semi-finalists 
underwent psychological testing to 
ensure their mental fitness in addi-
tion to physical examinations. 

The application asks questions 
from the expected to the more 
unusual, such as inqu ir ies about 
body art or what topics of conver-
sation are considered off- lim its at 
the dinner table. 

Since filming for the series is 
already complete, the ability to keep 
a secret for several months may have 
been a consideration as wel l. 

The contestants range in age 
from 23-53, and their vocations are 
varied from farmer to footwear 
designer.

Transportation and Parking Services recently opened 
729 parking spaces by Voigt D rive on the east side of 
Interstate S. 

Director of Parking and Transportation Services 
Greg Snee said the new lo t on the east campus pro-
vides enough spaces for students.

Muir College Suitcase 
Dance Awards Trip for Two 
By JANE KIM 

Nearly 100 Muir students packed their suitcases 
and headed to the Suitcase Dance at Sierra Summit 
on Friday night. The main attraction of the night was 
an all-expenses paid trip for two Muir College stu-
dents to an undisclosed destination for the three-day 
weekend. 

"Usually, a dance is just a dance. But this one 
kind of has a slight twist to it: said Muir 
Sophomore Senator Shige Itoh, who chaired the 
Suitcase Dance Committee. "People are supposed 

~o come with a bag packed for any weather, and 
we're trading their bag for a raffle ticket.Â· The twist 
was that the winner and a guest had to be ready to 
leave on the spot. 

The predetermined destination, Chicago, was 
kept secret until the winner was announced. The trip 
for two included hotel accommodations, airfare, 
transportation to the airport in a black stretch lim-
ousine, $200 in spending money and beanie-style 
hats. Other prizes included gift certificates and Muir 
Musical tickets. 

Freshman Sierra Fisk was the lucky w inner.

Edwards Named Athletic 
Director 
By ROBERT FULTON 

The UCSD athletic department announced yes-
terday that Earl Edwards has been named the new 
Athletic Director, effective M arch 1. 

Edwards will succeed Judith M . Sweet, who 
resigned after 24 years to resume a teaching position 
within the university. 

"We had a searching process with a committee; 
explained Joseph Watson, UCSD's vice chancellor of 
student affairs, who made the final decision of who 
would fill the empty spot. "They made some recom-
mendations. I think that Mr. Edwards would be a 
good selection." 

Edwards served as UCSD's associate athletic 
director from 1987- 1993. While previously serving 
UCSD, he initiated the Triton Athlete Associates, the 
athletic department's primary fundra ising source. He 
also served on numerous campus committees, 
'Supervised six intercollegiate sports and served as 
acting athletic director in the absence of the athletic 
director. 

For the past seven years, Edwards has served as 
director of athletics at East Stroudsburg University 
in Ea~t Stroudsburg, Penn.

Well. it's that time of year 
again. With the new year begin-
ning, every yahoo with a type-
writer is cranking out a list of the 
best and worst of the past year. 
Since I didn't want to be left out, 
[ figured I'd come up with some 
awards of my own. 

I had originally planned to do 
these awards while drunk (they 
probably would have been a hell 
of a lot funnier), but since [ passed 
out before I could get to a com-
puter last night (that East Coast 
iced tea went house on my sober 
ass), I'm now trying to write these 
with a hangover, so bear with me. 

Without further ado, [ now 
present the first-ever (and quite 
possibly the last-ever) Josh's [f-
everyo nc-else-gets-to- make- u p-
st u p id -yca r- i n -review-awards-
the n - [' m -s u re-as- hell-not-
going- to-be-Ieft-out Year 111 
Review Awards. 
M.n of .he Jur: 

[n my mind, this award can't 
be given to a single person. [ think 
that a pair of men have earned the 
right to be called the year's best. 
That's right, I'm talking about 
Adam Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel, 
the co-hosts of "The Man Show." 
[n this, their second season, these 
two men have taken chauvinism 
to new heights by continuing to 
bring us juggies and beer. Thank 
you men, ITom the bottom of my 
heart. 

The UCSD Guardian 

A compilation of 
meaningless awards 
with no logical order 

w..... of tile yur: 
Despite my desire to thank 

Carmen Electra for not only com-
ing to UCSD, but also for running 
half-naked through sprinklers in 
"Scary Movie; [ have to give this 
award up to Hillary Clinton. No 
woman has had a better year. 
Clinton is not only wrapping up 
her eighth year as president, but 
she was recently elected senator of 

ew York and she also signed an 
$8 million book deal. On top of 
that, she appears to have kept 
Little Bill in check for the past 
year, as no new interns have come 
forward. You go, girl. 
MoYIe of tile yur: 

This award can go to none 
other than "Gone in 60 Seconds." 
This movie had everything that a 
person could possibly want in a 
movie. [t had fast cars, explosions 
and Angelina Jolie's lips. For 
women, this movie also had a lot 
of drama. I've never seen so many 
men cry when E[eanor was 
crushed by the crane. For those of 
you that haven't seen the movie, 
Eleanor is a 1967 Shelby GT 500 
Mustang. [t is a truly beautiful 
sight. 

~ ... YI. of .... yur: 
[ ~asn't going to give this 

award, but there was a movie out 
there that was truly deserving of 
it. This movie would have easily 
taken the movie of the year if 
"Gone in 60 Seconds" hadn't 
been in the running. The picture 
that [ speak of is "Coyote Ugly: 
This movie had alcohol and 

women dancing on bars. Need [ 
say more? 
.......... of .... Jur: 

While there have been plenty 
of significant deaths within the 
past year, none struck home as 
much as Joseph Calleja, who 
passed away at the tender age of 
26. While many of you don 't rec-
ognize that name, you will most 
certainly recognize the name Joe 
C, which was his stage name when 
he performed with the likes of Kid 
Rock. Joe C's guest raps on "Devil 
Without a Cause" were both 
hilarious and witty. We will all 
miss you, Joe. 
........... of a.. Jur: 

Yes, [ am talking about the 
erection. How in the world did 
"Dubya" become our president? 
Reminiscent of Marion Barry, 
Dubya all but admitted to doing 
hard drugs (in this case, he snort-
ed mass quantities of coke) and 
was still elected to office. We can 
only hope that the idiot of all

smart people so that we can sur-
vive for the next four years. God 
help us all.

The Revelle College Council had an unusual influx of visitors at its 
weekly Thesday meeting when dozens of students participated in a sit-in 
- organized and led by RCC Publicity, Media and Campus Relations 
Director Kris Erickson - in protest of the way the RCC is run. 

The RCC is the governing body of Revelle College and all of Revelle's 
standing committees. 

Erickson said his goal in organizing the peaceful demonstration was to 
show the RCC that institutional changes in the framework of the council

After almost two months of debate and uncertainty, Maya Angelou 
accepted UCSO's offer to speak at this year's all-campus commencement,

"In a world with only a few household names, Maya Angelou has

important voices in not only world literature, but also in modem thinking." 

A.S. President Tesh Khullar, who headed the search for a gr!duation 
speaker along with A.S. Programmer Scott Mantell, said he is pleased with 
Angelou's commitment and that he expects students to respond positive-
ly to her speech. 

"[ am beyond happy right now; Khullar said. "In my opinion, this is 
one of the most important things that the A.S. has done all year."

ResNet Blocks Access to 
Napster 
I, VINCENT GRAMAN. 

UCSD Residential Networking blocked access 
last weekend to Napster, a software program that 
allows people to share mp3 files. ResNet officials 
said use of the SQftware was slowing campus 
Internet traffic. 

ResNet Coordinator Erik Strahm said the mea: 
sure is only temporary. 

Napster is a client software that not only pro-
vides people with a way of searchmg for and 
downloading mp3 files, but also makes the mp3 
files on the host machine available for download-
ing. 

In a letter sent out to all ResNet subscribers, 
ResNet officials stated that they saw the use of 
Napster increase at an incredible rate over the last 
six months. 

The letter stated that last weekend, Napster 
uploads and downloads saturated the campus 
Internet connection, slowing all campus Internet 
traffic and impairing the vital functions of the net-
work, such as education and research .

I, ROllEIII' FULION 

Words fail to appropriately convey the all-out 
dominance of the UCSD women's basketball game 

The UCSD Guardian 

against La Sierra University at home on Thesday 
night. 

"Blow-out; "laughter" and "demolish" come to 
mind to describe what loosely could be called a 
contest, but these words all fall short of describing 
what really happened. 

How about 103-19? 
That's right, the Triton women's basketball team 

downed the Golden Eagles of La Sierra 103-19 in 
front of a pleased but shocked home crowd. 

The winning margin of 84 points (84!) is the 
largest in Triton history, ec.lipsing the previ~us 
mark set in 1987 as the Tntons blew out MIlls 
College 100-19.

TeSS Gets the Axe for 
StudentLink 
By VINCBn' 8IIMNANI 

Beginning this fall, students will no longer be 
able to register for classes using the university'S 
telephone enrollment system and will instead have 
to use StudentLink. The change will save the uni-
versity 528,000. 

"We are planning on dropping Itelephone regis-
trationl as of Sept. 1 and asking students to use the 
Web specifically; said Richard Backer, associate 
vice chan"Cellor of enrollment management, and 
registrar. 

Backer said he m1Jde the decision in consulta-
tion with students and administrators after seeing 
the increasing popularity of students registering for 
classes over the Web.

Michael Campaign Stirs 
Controversy 
I y PAlllSA IAIWIIAN 

Michael Carley, a Warren senior, gave his personal testi-
mony regarding his faith in Christianity Friday at noon at the 
Price Center. Carley is the student at the center of the week-
long "I agree with Michael" campaign that caused controver-
sy among students. 

Tre campaign is sponsored by Campus Crusade for 
Christ :11 cooperation with several student-run Christian 
organizations. Supporters say that its aim is to spread the 
Christian message of living a life according to the Word in 
order to be saved. 

Campaign participants wore blue "I agree with Michael" 
shirts and manned tables throughout campus to support their 
cause. The campaign stirred disagreement among students.

APRIL 17th 
Independent Slate Dominates 
Election 
Iy IIA1T SCHIADIR 

The decrease in student voter participation in last 
week's A.S. Council elections did not alter the rejoicing 
and cheers last Thursday of Independent slate members, 
who took victory in all but one of the nine A.S. cam-
puswide positions. 

"I think my reaction after they announced it spells it all; 
A.S. President-elect Doc Khaleghi said. "It is very exciting to 
know that I had the support of undergraduates. What is 
about to come can seem overwhelming, but I am looking for-
ward to it." 

Khaleghi, the founder of the Independent slate, defeated 
fellow candidates Scott Mantell , Ali Yazdi, Derrick Yee and 
Tariq Parwani. 

Men I s Volleyball Wins National 
Championship 
1y1lLL ..... 

Prospects did not look good for the UCSD men's volley-
ball team heading into this season. The team had lost three 
of its top players from the previous year, and a new coach, its 
third in three years, was taking the helm. These changes, 
combined with two straight years of missing the National 
Championship Tournament, made this look like a rebuilding 
year for the Tritons. 

Looks can be very deceiving. 
This season saw the Tritons go undefeated in Division 11/ 

play and earn their first Mountain Pacific SportS Federation 
win in two years. It also saw them return to the National 
Championship Tournament, a tournament that won this 
weekend witli two three-game wins in Hoboken, N.].

ure out your menus for the week. If 
you play this game right, you could 
wind up with a profit. Pay attention 
to what's going on at your house 
Wednesday and Thursday. Your 
partner could decide to make a few 
changes. Just make sure he or she 
doesn't throw out your favorite 
sweater. Don't take a disagreement 
with your sweetheart too seriously 
on Friday. If you put in the correc-
tion that's being requested, on 
Saturday you two wi ll be happier 
than ever. Go through the Sunday 
papers, with scissors in hand. You 
could make even more next week. 

....... (May 21-June 21) 
There's plenty of money on 

Monday and Tuesday, but don't 
spend it all . Pay yourself first by 
sending a good-sized chunk to 
your retirement account. A no:w 
idea you're trying out at work 
could fall flat on Wednesday and 
Thursday. Practice before showing 
off and use a safety net. A perfec-
tionist, possibly somebody who 
lives with you, wants to tell you 
what to do on Friday and Saturday. 
This is going to be good advice, so 
take notes. Save Sunday for your 
sweetie. A long walk or a drive in 
the country and a meaningful COIl -
versation sweep the week's worries 
right out of your head. 

C â€¢ â€¢ 1f (June 22-)uly 22) 
You're liable to win the argu-

ment Monday and Tuesday, with 
help from your friends. Take care of 
your teammates, not just yourst:lf, 
and they'll take care of you. You'd 
like to do everything for your loved 
ones on Wednesday and Thu~ay, 
but you can't afford it. They'll 
understand.. eventually. Study to 
keep up With the competition on 
Friday and Saturday, and you could 
come out the winner again . A 
peaceful Sunday at home will be 
much appreciated. Read a good 
book. 

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) 
Follow your hunches on 

Monday and Tuesday to set priori-
ties. You have too much to do. so 
put first things first. You're in the 
spotlight on Wednesday and 
Thursday. Don't go too far out on 
a limb, or you could lose your bal-
ance. Friday's good for getting 
more money if you also want a new 

job. Profit through your own 
effortS on Saturday and learn a new 
skill on Sunday. 

VIrP (Aug. 23Â·Sept. 22) 
You're looking good on 

Monday and Tuesday. If you're 
looking for love, a friend might 
want to upgrade then. The pres-
sure's intense on Wednesday and 
Thursday, partially due to break-
downs. If others can't decide what 
they want, step in and do it for 
them. You and your sweetheart 
may have to take off in two differ-
ent directions on Friday. That's 
OK. Saturday'S better for making 
plans for the future, anyway. Go 
through your old coat pockets on 
Sunday and look under the couch 
cushi,pns, too. Odds are good you'll 
find something of value. 

Ubn (Sept . 23-Oct. 23) 
Be polite on Monday and 

Tuesday, even if it's difficult. A 
moody older person could tum out 
to be a good friend, although at 
first it seems unlikely. Try not to 
have friends over to your place 
Thursday or Friday. They'd just 
complicate matters and interfere 
with your private time. Finish up 
old chores o_n Saturday. That will 
give you time on Sunday to play 
with your favorite people. navel's 
OK then, but don't stay out late. 
Leave plenty of time for snuggling. 

ScorpIo (Oct. 24Â·Nov. 21) 
Your intuition's excellent on 

Monday and Tuesday. Use it 
regarding romance arid to make 
your home more comfortable. 
Consider taking on more responsi-
bility Wednesday and Thursday, 
but don't sign anything yet. Find 
out what the job involves before 
you say you'll do it. A visit with 
friends on Friday could go late, 
interfering with a private engage-
ment. Better call, or you could get 
left out in the cold. You and your 
date have a great time Saturday, 
visiting friends together. But save 
time for contemplation and plan-
ning on Sunday. 

s.cm .... (Nov. 22-0ec . 21) 
Be practical on Monday and 

Tuesday. You might not have as 
much money as you thought, after 
you finish paying bills. You're 
tempted to play hooky on 
Wednesday and Thursday, but that 
would be a big mistake. A co-work-
er would snitch! You want to be 
guiltless on Friday, anyway, when 
negotiating for more money. 
Launch your garage enterprise on 
Saturday and make a tidy profit. 
Gather with close friends and 
neighbors on Sunday. A potluck 
would be perfect. 

C.,rIcon (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) 
Your partner's in a snit on 

Monday or Thesday, but that's OK. 
You can work out a compromise 
and not give up what you want. 
Financial negotiations are full of 
surprises on Wednesday and 
Thursday. Be careful shopping 
then. All of the surprises are not 
pleasant. Travel might take you 
away from a loved one on Friday, 
but you can make up for it 
Saturday. Go wherever you're 
going together then. Be respectful 
to an older person on Sunday, and 
you'll profit from that interaction, 
too. 

......... (Jan. 2(}Feb. 18) 
Do the work and make the 

money on Monday and Thes<tay. 
You may have to figure out which 
work to do, but that's OK. You can. 
Hassles with your partner mar 
Wednesday and Thursday. You 
won't give an inch and neither will 
he or she, so let that deal ride for a 
while. Compromising will be easier 
later. Shop for the good deals on 
Friday and Saturday, and you1' find 
them. This goes for household

uled to be held June 17.

time remained.

New Parking Structure Opens 
., VINCINT MMNANI 

The new Gilman Parking Structure, which contains 858 
parking spaces, opened Monday at 7 a.m. after a year of con-
struction. 

The opening, however, does not necessarily mean relief 
for students looking for more convenient parking. Greg 
Snee, director of Parking and Transportation Services, said 
that due to the closing of the north parking lots, there are 
now fewer student spaces than there were in spring. 

Triton Sports Moves into 
Division" 
By ROBERT FULTON 

Good-bye to the small schools and the easy wins. Hello to 
a whole new world. 

UCSD's athletics program is venturing into uncharted 
territory with its move to Division II competition. 

The Tritons previously played their games in Division III, 
winning numerous championships. Now, with a higher level 

I of play, the competition will be tougher. 
Â· Primarily, it's the right thing for us to do right now with the 

growth of the institution," UCSD Director of Athletics Earl 
Edwards said. Â· We're at 19,000 and prepared to go to 30,000 in 
the next few years. That's a much larger student population 
than most Division III schools have."

Plac â€¢â€¢ (Feb. 19-March 20) 
You are so cute on Monday and 

Tuesday; you'll be irresistible. And, 
you're so nice, that you're putting 
others first. You're a big winner, 
and so are they! The work is com-
plex on Wednesday and Thursday. 
Don't feel bad if some of it has to 
be done over; it's probably not your 
fault. Proceed with caution, just to 
make sure. A temporary clash with 
a loved one on Friday is nothing to 
get upset about. By Saturday it'l\ be 

"forgotten or seem like a joke. You 
know all those' friends you've been 
promising lunch? Have them all 
over on Sunday.

yourself anymore. Find someone 
you can trust and share your pre-
ciousÂ· plans. 

Jan. 10: Stash away as much as

In Two Directions 
Women's basketball team had a successful 
December, the men were not so fortunate 
By lI0II111' FULTON 
Sports Editor 

It was the best of breaks, it was 
the worst of breaks. 

The month of December saw a 
tale of two different basketball 
squads for UCSD. 

The men's and women's teams 
seem to be headed in separate 
directions. 

The women's record now 
stands at 7-3 while the men now 
sport a 2-8 record. 

The highlight for the women 
was the 21 st annual UCSD 
Doubletree Invitational. The 
1ritons knocked off Savannah 71-
67 to earn a trip to the final. 

In the final, UCSD outplayed 
the University of Findlay, narrowly 
winning the 70-68 overtime tilt. 

Maya Fok was on fire for UCSD 
in the final game, scoring 22 points. 
Ashley Kokjohn contributed with 
11 points and 11 rebounds. 

Fok made the All-Tournament 
team and was named the tourna-
ment 's Most Valuable Player. 

Water Polo: 
Loss to UCLA does not 
dampen season at all 
c:ontnIed froIII ..... D 
dominated in both offense and 
defense, scoring 11 goals and hold-
ing the lritons to two. 

While the Tritons had marked 
their first win ever against USC the 
day before, UCLA proved to con-
tinue its streak against the Tritons, 
who have never defeated the Bruins 
in thc water. While at the end of the 
first quarter UCLA's 3-1 lead 
seemed surpassable, by the end of 

Only $150.00 

Kokjohn also was named to the 
AU-Tournament team. 

The men had a rough month 
but did have a couple of highlights. 

The 1ritons made mincemeat of 
San Francisco State 96-77 in the 
middle of last month for their first 
win of the season. 

Nick Christensen led the way 
with a career-high 26 points. 
Christensen was hot from down-
town, hitting four of five three-
pointers. He also had nine rebounds. 

Cole Miller scored 17 points for 
UCSD and Ryan Swed chipped in 
with 12. 

UCSD was up 44-36 at half-
time and cruised from there. 

A second Triton win came on 
the road at La Verne, with UCSD 
winning 77-63. Miller scored 19 
points and had eight rebounds. 
Swed scored 18 and Mike Martin 
contributed with 10. 

Both the men and women trav-
el for games against Cal Poly 
Pomona on Friday. The women 
play at 5:45 p.m. and the men play 
at 7:45 p.m. 

the third, an unchecked run of 
seven UCLA goals took the Bruins 
to a decisive - lead, and UCSD's 
fourth quarter goal only served to 
stop play in what proved to be a 
quarter of formality as UCLA ran 
down the clock on its way to the 
national title. 

Despite being scoreless in the 
finals however, Boettner was 
awarded a spot on the AII-
Tournament first team, the only 
Triton among six other UCLA and 
USC players. Djapic, Wylie and 
Jonathan Samuels were awarded 
spots on second team as the 
Tritons finished a phenomenal first 
season.

Big Upset Wonderful Parting Gift For UCSD 
. The Triton men's water polo squad drowns 
USC 9-8 to finish in second place in nationals 
By!OWU 
Staff Writer 

With an unprecedented 9-8 vic-
tory over the University of 
Southern California in the NCAA 
men's water polo semifinals, the 
Tritons advanced to the champi-
onship game at Pepperdine 
University last month, only to be 
devastated by seven-time champi-
ons UCLA in an 11 -2 loss. 

Despite suffering such a great 
defeat in the finals, the Tritons can 
.be proud of their underdog over-
throw of second-seed USC in the 
semifinals. 

Despite being seeded ninth in 
the nation coming into the tourna-
ment, the Tritons defied history to 
makl! not only their first appear-
ance in the final game, but the first 
appearance by any Western Water 
Polo AssociatioQ school. 

Babic's third goal, the 1ritons 
quickly battled back. By the end of 
the third quarter, the Tritons had 
tied the game with a goal by Justin 
Wylie, then taken the lead with a 
four-meter penalty shot by Jason 
Boettner. 

However, USC refused to go 
down without a fight, and the 
fourth quarter continued the 
back-and-forth drama that char-
acterized the match's first three 
quarters. 

USC tied the game 7-7 with a 
goal early in the fourth, but UCSD 
took a decisive 9-7 lead with a goal 
by Brent Allan with about three 
minutes left to play. Seconds later 
though, USC's Steven O'Rourke 
lobbed a shot into the goal to bring 
USC within one. 

The Tritons managed to hold 
onto the lead through the end of 
the game, with a breathtaking save 
by goalie Glenn Busch and by 
regaining possession of the ball 
with 11 seconds left, allowing them 
to run down the clock and capture 
a berth in the final game. 

Also, they defeated USC for the 
first time in 32 meetings between 
the two schools. [n doing so, they 
became the 10th team to join an 
elite 'group of schools that have 
competed in the NCAA title game, 
entering a group of perennial elites 
that includes UCLA, Stanford, UC 
BerKeley and Pepperdine. 

The game against USC on Dec. 
2 proved to be a nail-biter to the 
end. While the Tritons pulled 
ahead in the first quarter to lead 2-
1 going into the second, USC 
responded to the Tritons' third goal 
wi th two of their own as the second 
quarter came to a close, leaving the

The most notable performance 
in the USC game. which Triton 
coach Denny Harper described as 
"David slaying Goliath: was that of 
Boettner, who led the team with a 
total of five goals. Four other 
Triton players, Allan, Vladimir 
Djapic, Kellan Hori and Wylie, con- . 
tributed a goal each, while Triton 
goalkeeper Busch matched the 
seven saves of both USC goalies.

The Various 
Faces of 
Football 

Fulton 
Corner 

ROBERT FULTON 

T he world of football has two distinct branches: one is that of the NFL and the 
other is of its little brother, college 
football. 

The state of each is on vastly 
different sides of the scale. 

The NFL seems to being doing 
a lot right . It has diversity amongst 
the teams. This year's playoffs fea-
ture a number of clubs that, had 
their names been considered for 
the playoffs before the season start-
ed, the ones making the predic-
tions would have been labeled 
insane or on heavy amounts of 
drugs. 

The Saints and the Eagles both 
miraculously turned things around 
and made it to the postseason. 
Amazing. Even better yet, the 
Saints did It without their starting 
quarterback and running back for a 
large portion of the year. They had 
d couple of unknowns lead their 
team on offense, winning the 
Western Division. Who would have 
thought that either of those teams 
would make it to the respectability, 
let alone make it to the postsea-
son? 

The same goes for the AFC. 
Baltimore, of all teams, is in the 
postseason. It didn 't even have a 
team a couple of years ago. Trent 
Dilfer has seemingly come back 
from the dead, playing just enough 
to let the Baltimore defense win 
games. The other surprise is the 
Oakland Raiders. The dreaded sil-
ver and black were preparing to 
explode, but their run this year is 
still impressive. 

The college game is a little dif-
ferent. 

The college football bowl sea-
son came to a stunning halt last 
week when Oklahoma University 
defeated Florida State University 
13-2 to win the Orange Bowl and 
the Bowl Championship Series 
National Championship. 

College football lucked out. If 
the Seminoles had won that game, 
all hell would have broken out. 

Miami defeated Florida handi-
ly in the Sugar Bowl the day 
before. It would have had one 
loss, just like FSU. The only dif-
ference is that Florida State's loss 
came against Miami. Even more, 
the University of Washington also 
had one loss, and its victory list 
included a conquest of Miami. 
The question of which was the 
best team in the country would 
have been anyone's guess. 

Luckily, the Sooners won and 
all was well. Oklahoma was clearly 
the best team of the year, going 13-
O. But should it have been Florida 
State in the title game instead of 
either Miami or Washington? That 
is still up for argument. 

The system still stinks, though, 
and needs to be changed. 

The pro game seems to have 
accomplished what it has been 
trying to do: Give every team, 
every city and every fan a chance 
at glory. 

The college game, on the other 
hand, is wallowing in confusion, 
running the risk of not baving a 
clear champion.

PORTS 
Twice as Sweet 

DaYld Pill/ GuardilJn 

Cll .... lons: The UCSD women's S()(ctr tÂ£am, shown here during a match earlier 
Jhis season, defeated a pair of tough foes to win the Division II National title. 

By IIOIIIRT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

Division 1I? Piece of cake as far 
as the UCSD women's soccer 
team is concerned . 

Last month, the Tritons cap-
tured the 2000 Division [[ cham-
pionship by defeating Northern 
Kentucky University 2-1 at Barry 
University in Miami Shores. 

With the score tied at 1-1, 
Triton senior Christy Abizaid 
passed the ball to teammate and 
fellow senior Cindy Dostalek. 
Dostalek took the ball and scored 
the winning goal with only 15 sec-
onds remaining in regulation for 
the title. : 

U[ saw Kristin (Jones) coming 
down the line and [ said 'this is it' '-
Dostalek said. uThe ball came 
across from Christy, and I just fol-
lowed it through. M er the goal , [ 
looked up at the clock and it said 15 
seconds and I could not believe it." 

The Tritons dominated the 
second half, attempting six corner 
kicks in five minutes. 

UCSD almost gave up the win-
ning goal as the Norse's Becky 
Schnieder launched a shot with 
43 seconds left. Triton goalkeeper 
Kami Poma came up big with her 
second save of the day and set off 
the events that led to the winning 
goal. 

The first half was scoreless but 
not without championship-caliber 
excite(Tlent. UCSD almost took a 

NCAA Division II National 
Champions 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team captured their second 
consecutive national 
championship last month after 
defeating Northern Kentucky 
University 2-1 with a last-
second shot. Only this time it 
was in Division II. 

1-0 lead, but Laura Dooly's head-
er came just short, striking the 
crossbar. 

Northern Kentucky goalkeeper 
Lauren Piening was busy all day, 
making six saves. 

The second half looked fright-
ening as the Norse took a 1-0 
advantage at the 51 :31 mark. 
Northern Kentucky's Betsy Moore 
dribbled the ball up the field and 
passed the ball to teammate lHcia 
Ruark. Ruark passed it to Denise 
Kunz, who introduced the ball to 
the net. 

U[ felt we needed a goal against 
us to wake us up; said lHton 
head coach Brian McManus. U[ 
think today we deserved it. We've 
had games at times that we 
thought we may have stolen, but 
we deserved this one. We out-
played them." 

The Tritons quickly answered 
Northern Kentucky's goal. At 
66:15, Christine Wensel launched 
a corner kick to the far post. 
Dooly was there to greet the ball 
and rocked it into the net, tying 
the game at 1-1. . 

Northern Kentucky was very 
impressed with UCSD. 

uUC San Diego has a great 
team; said Northern Kentucky 
head coach Bob Sheehan. uWe 
were pleased with our effort, but a 
little disappointed with how we 
played. When you give up 16 cor-
ner kicks it's tough to win. They 
just kept serving the ball into the 

box and taking their shots." 
The Thtons are no strangers to 

championships, having captured 
five trophies a! the Division [I[ 
level. 

-

This title was even more 
impressive, considering that this 
was the first year for UCSD at the 
Division II level. 

Accolades went all around for 
the lHtons. Dostalek earned the 
tournament's Outstanding 
Offensive Player award and Kara 
Morris was named the 
Outstanding Defensive Player. 
Also making the all-tournament 
team were Elizabeth Hughes.Julia 
Cuder and Erika Alfredson. 

The road lO the final was not 
an easy path. UCSD had to get by 
defending national champion 
Franklin Pierce of New 
Hampshire. The lHtons did just 
that, winning in overtime 2-1. 

Northern Kentucky knocked 
off host school and previously 
undefeated Barry University to 
reach the final. 

The TIitons finish the year 
with a 21-2 record. They have also 
won 17 straight matches, with 
their last lost coming back on 
Sept. 22 against California State 
Dominguez Hills. 

uYou can't go out better than 
this." Abizaid said. uThe first half 
was the most fun ['Ve had playing 
soccer. I really appreciate the 
chance my teammates gave me to 
go out this way."
