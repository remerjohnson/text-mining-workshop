New committee 
discusses plans 
for the future 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Staff Wnter 

Members of the A.5. Council, represelll,l-
tives from the five colleges. the (0- ps. club 
sports,and interested stlldcnts and graduat(,s 
met Fridav for a third discussion on thl' for-
mation ot' a committee for next vear 's fee n:t-
erendum. . 

The meeting was held with the knowl-
edge of Viet.: Chanct'llor of StlIdclll Affairs 
Joseph Watson's decision to place a freeze 011 
his proposed 10 percent cut to all student 
services to fund the Price Center expansion. 

Accordi ng to A.S. Comm issioner of 
Serv ices and Enterprises Colin Parent. 
Watson made this decision to allow the stu-
dents one year to pass a referendum to 
finance the Price Center expansion. He said 
this al lows the students flexibility in forming 
a referendum. 

"We as stude nts have the administration 
by the ba lls right now." Parent said. "I don 't 
want to see student services geaing cut to 
fund a Price Center expansion and better 
Division II sports teams." 

A new referendum committee was already 
bei ng considered prior to Watson 's decision. 

"A lot of our campaigning against Ihe ref-
erendum [this year[ was with the idea that 
another referendum would be proposed." 
said Sam Meister, a representative from the 
Che Cafe. 

The meeting ran from 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 
p.m. 111 the International Center Cl)nlcrcncc 
room. 

"The goal in mind is getting a lot of peo-
ple into this referendum." said Kris Bohling

Express to Success Holds Fahion Show 
Revelle's '80s fashion show raises money for Becky's House charity 
REBECCA WOOD 
Senior Staff Writer 

The second annual Express to 
Success Charity Fashion Show 
raised $5,777 for Becky's House 
last Thursday. Becky's House 
provides shelter for women and 
children who are victims of 
domestic abuse. 

ETS student models walked 
the catwalk in Revelle Plaza Cafe 
in this year's event, which was 
themed "Remember the Time ... 
80's Flashback: and was fol-
lowed by a raffle drawing and a 
free dance sponsored by Club 
911. 

Among the most desired raffle 
prizes were Palm pilots, TVs. A-
parking spaces, and gift certificates 

that were given away. 
The annual event was designed 

to culminate all the skills students 
have learned through ETS and to 
give back to the San Diego com-
munity. Â¥embers ofETS work on 
inter and intra-personal commu-
nication skills and persuasive and 
demonstrative speaking skills 
through various activities during 
the year, 

Co-host Monica Zakowski, 
and ETS alumna said, "It is a big 
step for members working on their 
communication skills. Getting up 
there on the runway gives them 
self-confidence." 

She added that the event 
demonstrated that the San Diego 
community has an interest in 
helping out those in need. 

"College students care about rais-
ing money for a good cause and 
are willing to help," she said. 

The event was sponsored by 
Activation Energy Productions, 
which is a SOLO organization. 
The La Jolla Country Day School 
also helped to raise approximately 
$1 ,500 for the show. 

Revelle sophomore Diana 
King explained that there were 
many facets to the show that she 
and other students were involved 
in, such as promotion , ticket seil-
ing, planning, stage setup and 
production. She said that the 
efforts of the students helped 
bring students from other col-
leges to see the fashion show at 
Plaza Cafe. 

The fashion show brought 

attention to the serious issue of 
domestic abuse. In 1999. 181 ca lls 
of domestic violence were reported 
in San Diego. In a national survey. 
approximately 50 percent of the 
men who frequ ently assaulted 
their wives also frequently abused 
their children . 

Abuse is also an issue for col-
lege students. One quarter of 
female college students have been 
victims of sexual assault or sur-
vivors of the attempted assaul t. Of 
these victims, 90 percent have 
known their assaulters. 

The YWCA, which coordinated 
the project, also offers supportive 
services such as psychological and 
educational counseling, child care 
and job training for victims of 
domestic abuse.

Fee: 
Line-Item vote is being 
considered for referendum 
Continued from page 1 

of the Student Co-ops and the 
Graduate Student Associa tion. 
"People in general don't want to have 
their fees raised." 

One of the main goals of those in 
attendance was to figure out what they 
wanted to accomplish. 

"We need to figure out what we 
want to do before we head out in all 
directions," said Thurgood Marshall 
College Student Counci l Chair Adam 
Sharki. "I feel like I don't know what 
everyone sitting at this table wants." 

The discussion then went around 
the room to give everyone a chance to 
express their desires. 

"n,e rcason I'm here is to try to 
facilitate something where people are 
rcally listening," said A.S. Vice President 
Internal Jenn Brown. "I'm here to make 
sure everyone's voice is heard." 

The meeting was intended as a 
forum for ideas on how to form the 
committee for the new referendum. 

"Setting up a committee is proba-
bly the best idea, as long as the com-
mittee is committed: said Muir 
Sophomore Senator Matt Barge. 

The debate hinged on the size and 
organization of the proposed committee. 

"I don't see 400 students as a very 
effective committee," said A.S. President 
Jeff Dodge. "I feel that a representative 
comminee should be set up." . 

Revelle College Counci l Chair 
Mark Stickel emphasized that open 
meetings are necessary to maximize 
student input. 

Peter Butcher of club sports elabo-
ra ted on the idea, suggesting regular 
"town hall " meetings to inform the 
UCSD community of the committee's, 
progress. 

Surveying students to find out 
what they want on the referendum 
was also discussed as an idea. 

Dodge proposed that the new ref-
erendum be a line-item vote in which 
students vote to approve each specific 
allocation within the referendum. The 
Idea was well-received but not overtly 
discussed by those in attendance. 

Sharki expressed his belief that the 
administration should be included in 
the process, though not as voting 
members of the committee. 

"As much as we love to hate them, 
and as much as they're just bastards, if 
we let someone like Watson into the 
process and let them have input, we 
won't run the risk of them shooting it 
down," Sharki said. "As long as they 
know what's going on, they'll probably 
have less of a problem wi th it." 

The issue of publicizing the meet-
ings for next year was a major con-
cern . A lack of funding prevented pub-
licity this year. 

The students at the meeting decid-
ed that it would be in UCSD's best 
interest to delay the formation of the 
committee until the fall. 

"Let's not make this rushed," said 
Eleanor Roosevel t College Council 
Chair David Goodwin. "We can take 
our time. We can inform others about 
it."

Some students were shocked to

dining hall and Schwemm's Gourmet 
Coffee House, but they may have been 
more surprised to learn that the ban 
was part of an elaborate ruse orches-
trated by senior art student, Andrew

By banning coffee, Epstein said he 
hoped to demonstrate the hypocri y of 
drug laws that sanction certain sub-
stance abuse while banning others.

Rights! 
Though honorable in its intent, this act is endorsed by anti-
abortionists and is a first step to ending abortion rights 
By MARY-ONEUA ESTUDILLO 
Staff Writer 

First China, then the tax cuts, now this. 
Just when we thought the abortion debate 
had simmered down for a bit. the Bush 
administration decides to back a bill that 
would make the separate life of a fetus a fea-
sible victim in the assault of a pregnant 
woman. 

While many conservatives believe it to 
be an anti-crime measure, with no inten-
tion of supporting the ' stance of abortion-
rights supporters, many 
are worried that this new 

propose that the fetus is a vital human 
~eing, i.t inches its way into staking its claim 
111 pubitc attItude, and eventually public pol-
ICY. I hate to sound overly dramatic, but in 
the passage of this bill, it is indeed the 
beginning of the end. 
. . Imagine this bill passing. Not only would 
It II1crease the leverage of anti-abortionists, 
but it w?uld also provoke doubt and specu-
lat!on In the eyes of Americans about 
whether a fetus is a human being and would 
eventually put Roe v. Wade in a compromis-
II1g position. 

It is very likely that 

measure would under-
mine a woman's right to 
choose and eventually 
affect the Roe v. Wade 
decision. 

They are right. con 
should this bill pass the 
Senate, it would change 
the public's perception of 
what an abortion really is 
and re-ignite the age-old 
debate of fetal rights. 

This bill IS clearl a 
wolf in sheep's clothing. 
It IS anti-abortion legisla-

Although this is not to

for hurting both a mother and a child, it is 
clearly a s traightforwa ~c'. attack on a

major point in PreSident Bush s agenda, a

The Fetal Protection Aci passed in the

An Avid Guardian ' 
Reader Gets Noticed 

New Persectives on Volunteerism 
Hands on San Diego proves Gen X stereotype wrong 

Stop

BERTRAND FAN 

Ever been tc the UCS D Guardian Web site (http:// www. ucsdguardian. org)? 
Well, if you have, then you know 
the name of Ben Boychuk. Coin: 
cidentally, Ben isn't actually a 
member of the Guardian st.aff. 
He's what I would like to call a 
Contributing Opinion Writer. He 
contributes his opinion by writ-
ing comments about each and 
every article we write. 

By deductive reasoning, we can 
thus assume that he reads each 
and every article we write. I didn 't 
know anybody did that, besides 
Tom Vu, the opinion editor. Like 
Tom, he makes suggestions and 
comments about what we should, 
and shouldn't write on. So this 
brings the obvious question: 
What the hell are we paying Tom 
fo r? This man , Ben Boychuk, will 
read and edit all of our opinion 
articles fo r free! He even spell 
checks ieners to the editor. 

There are other reasons I like 
Ben better than Tom. Tom calls 
me Bertrand or Bert, whereas Ben 
refers to me as Senior Staff Writer 
Mr. Fan . Senior Staff Writer Mr. 
Fan sounds a lot classier than 
Bert - that and I don't think 
Tom is really giving me the whole 
nine yards. 

Sometimes, Tom will ca ll me 
up or write to me and say that 
such and such sel1tence is 
"risque" or "inappropriate: Ben 
will just straight up call me a 
damn idiot. It's that son of con-
structive criticism that really gets 
the point across. Tom usually tries 
to keep his comments cordial 
regarding the article, but Ben real-
ly looks out for my well-being. 

For example, Ben advised in 
his May 3 post, "Get good grades. 
Get your degree. Get out. And 
shut the hell up. You aren't half as 
clever as you think." Ben isn't just 
an editor to me, he's a counselor 
and a psychologist for my person-
al life as well - a journalistic 
messiah, if you will. 

One good thing about Ben is 
that he is the end-all opinion on 
everytl1ing. I no~ find it unneces-
sary to have an opinion about 
anything because if I ever need the 
absolute divine truth, I just turn 
to Ben. I don't subscribe to the 
theory that Ben is a pedophile 
who sits at home in his underwear 
refreshing the Gtulrdian Web page 
until new articles appear, l.think it 
is simply wonderful that he takes 
the time out of his busy day to 
write comments longer than the 
articles themselves and lecture an 
entire staff on the "basic tenets of 
journalism." 

The fact that he has chosen 
the Web format of the Guardian 
over the actual printed newspaper 
demonstrates his tender embrace

Contributing OpinIOn Writer 

With the m~dia 's recent por-
trayal of young people in the 
news, our genera tion seems 
marked with random and needless 
violence, With linle to offer in the 
way of making positive changes in 
our world. I feel that we have been 
deemed Generation X undeserv-
ingly, though . 

I would argue that there are 
many among us who make a 
valia nt effort every day to make a 
difference. Unfo!:tunately, those 
who lead the crusade to positively 
impact their communities, on any 
level. are not usually the ones to 
make the nightly news. I was 
proud to represent UCSD on a 
recent service project where I fe lt 
our campus exemplified the good 
our generation is capable of. 

Last weekend, over 200 UCSD 
students from all five colleges 
devoted their Saturday to their 
surrounding community'S need. 
From cleaning up graffiti to help-
ing to build the foundation for a 
home for the poor, Hands on San 
Diego organized 18 service pro-
grams for the students to choose 
fro m. It was an all-day event, and 
breakfast was offered to all the 
students before they departed fo r 
their programs, followed by a bar-
becue and music afterward. 

The project was initiated 10 
years ago by the Volunteer Con-
nection under the gl,lidance of 
Ellen Caprio and has grown pro-
gressively over the years. 

"Hands on San Diego was an 
effort created to give students a 

taste of vol unteering," expla ined 
Chad Hicks-Beach of the Volun-
teer Connection."1t was also made 
to bring students together." 

The project seemed to ,lttract 
students wi th va ry1l1g back-
grounds in volunteering, from thL' 
experienced to novices such as 
myself. That is truly what makes It 
such a worthwhtle project, 
because by allow1I1g sllldents to 
"test the waters" if you wtll. Ihey 
often become hooked, kad ing 
them to seek out other ways to get 
involved. Participating 111 the pro-
ject certainly sparked my desire to 
seek out similar opportunities. 

The spirit of volunteerism at 
UCSD is strong, though II may 
take a little effort to get involved . 
Often, projects like Hands on San 
Diego go unnoticed Simply 
because publicity is difficult and 
expensive, or the administration 
fails to take notice of the projects. 

A perfect example was the ser-
vice trip to the Dominican Repub-
lic organized by e.O.R.E .. Eleanor 
Roosevelt College 's community 
outreach program over spring 
break. A commendable project 
that took nine students and one 
administrator to the Hogar 
Escuela Armando Rosenburg 
orphanage of poverry- str icken 
Santo Domingo, it regrettably 
received very little universitywlde 
attention . 

In a small presentation for tile 
Eleanor Roosevelt administration, 
the students were heralded as pio-
neers by the project's coordinator 
Lorna Hirae-Reese. Indeed, this 
was the very first of this type of 
organized service trip to a foreign

6 OPINION 

Human Touch Is Still 
Needed in This World 
By CASSANDRA PIERCE 
Senior Staff Writer 

There is an alarming trend in this 
country of interpreting electronic 
means of communication as being 
nearly as good as face- to-face contact. 
This only grows stronger with the 
advent of new lech nology such as 
video conferencing and the prevalence 
of personal computers and Web cams. 

The trend began with e-mail, and 
everybody started getting up in arms 
about howe-mail was going to 

d~stroy the art of letter writing. The 
whole idea behind thaI concern is 
ridiculous. Most ,,-mails sent to others 
arc concise and to the point, like notes 
left 011 someone's door or messages 
011 an answering machine: "Sorry I 
couldn't meet you today, how about 
tomorrow at 1 :30? Call me." 

However, e-mails to people whom 
you are keeping in tollch with and 
whom you are some distance away 
from lend to be longer and more 
explanatory, and often take more 
lime to prepare than these short 
nOles. In this way, e-mail does not 
destroy the art of letter writing, made 
nearly obsolete by the advent of long-
distance telephone service, but actu-
ally preserves it to some extent. 

What e-mail does threaten are 
phone conversations. I'm not talking 
about the conversations people are 
havll1g with their clients as they hur-
tle down Interstate 5, but the conver-
sations between friends separated by 
dislance. E-mail is cheaper, quicker, 
less involved and more reliable in 
reaching someone than a phone call. 
I am as guilty of this ShOrtcul com-
munication method as anyone, pre-
ferring to hand out my e-mail 
address rather than my phone num-

ber because I am often out of the 
house but able to access a computer. 

However, no amount of smileys 
will convey the subtle nuances of a 
mere phone call, and there are many 
times I goad myself about not pick-
ing up the handset next to my com-
puter and giving my best friend in 
Davis, Calif. a ring. I have not seen 
her since winter break, and to hear 
her voice when I actually do call is a 
wonderful fee ling. Yes, occasionally 
we ICQ each other; but on ICQ, can 
you laugh with each anoth.er? Of 
course not, especially when you 're 
not alone in the room. And I know 
I'm not the only one who types "101" 
when I'm not really laughing. That 
doesn't even count. 

There is a terrific sense of "with-
ness" that you only get when you're 
actually with someone. Even on the 
phone, the purity of the withness is 
fairly low: You talk to someone on 
the phone; you talk with someone in 
person. 

It's almost like attending a lecture, 
where the lecturer is distant from you. 
You can Â· talk to the professor and 
you'll get an answer, but you are not 
talking with your professor. Even in 
the rare occasion that you are invited 
to the front of the room by a professor, 
you are only a guest, hovering in a 
kind of limbo where the professor is 
forced to pay attention to you, but 
must still acknowledge the rest of the 
audience. 

Go with a professor to lunch , and 
you'll experience this weird sensa-
tion of being recognized as almost an 
equal. which is very disconcerting 
given the previous experience of 
being the one taught to, taught at, in

stern message that law enforce-
ment agencies are taking a stand 
on violence against women, 
namely pregnant ones. By adding 
another victim to such crimes, 
this law will necessarily punish 
those who break it more severely. 

Another reason this law is 
important is that improvements in 
medical science now make it pos-
sible for younger fetuses to survive 
outside the womb. Since a five- or 
six-month-old fetus would be 
viable if born prematurely, we 
must take action to protect it as a 
life. While this may give rise to a 
new debate in the abortion arena, 
we should not use that fact as an 
excuse to ignore the rights of a 
viable human being.

ow don't get me wrong. I 
definitely agree when Bush says 
that we must "affirm a commit-
ment to a culture of life which 
welcomes and protects children,Â· 
but we must also ensure that cul-
ture of life means the freedom of 
choice and reproductive autono-
my to those that exist in the "cul-
ture of life." Only by ensuring 
women this indefinite right to 
choice can we truly affirm a com-
mitment to life and the implica-
tions of what exactly it means to 
strive for "life, liberty and the 
pursuit of happiness." 

We are moving into an age 
when medical advancements are 
redefining what we consider 
human life, and we must start 
enacting laws to protect all that 
can be considered as such. We 
cannot leave it up to Washington 
burea ucrats to pick and choose 
only some of us to be protected 
under the law. Fetal rights is a 
crucial first step, as advancements 
in cloning and genetic engineer-
ing will provide interesting devel-
opments in this field in the future. 

One popular argument 
against this bill is that it is nar-
row in scope and is thus not 
important enough to pass. Since 
it is a federal law, it does not 
cover instances of domestic 
abuse, though half of states have 
adopted equivalent laws to pro-
tect fetuses against domestic 
abuse. The law does, however, 
specifically target military bases, 
where domestic abuse and vio-
lence against women is certainly 

I am all for punishing hus-
bands who beat their pregnant 
wives to the death of her nine-
month old fetus (as was the fea-
tured case in the passage of this 
bill). But if such a bill is not main-
tained along the lines of abortion 
law (for example, the bill's authors 
should specify that the assai lant 
can be charged doubly if the fetus 
is beyond the first trimester, just 
as abortion is regulated), then this 
bill single-handedly emasculates 
the argument of all the abortion 
rights and privacy rights cases that 
America has gone through . 

There are many ways to 
amend this bill so that victims of 
crimes will be served justice with-
out actually taking the step to 
acknowledging the unborn child 
as a separate person. For instance,

an important and - until now-
unaddressed issue. 

Scope is not a valid measure in 
determining the merit of a law. 
Look at environmental protection 
regulations aimed at preserving 
the habitats of single endangered 
species - very narrow in scope 
but also incredibly important. 

In a majority rule form of gov-
erning, one must take great pains 
to protect the few, no matter how 
few. Until this point, the fetus 
has gone unprotected. Whether 
you consider life valid at concep-
tion, a few months into pregnan-
cy or birth itself, few would argue 
that an unborn child is insignifi-
cant. Losing an unborn child can 
be a devastating loss to an 
expecting mother, and anyone 
who induces this should be pun-
ished as if an infant has been 
killed. This law will make sure 
this happens, and ensure the 
punishment is one that fits this 
heinous crime. 

makes the harm of a fetus illegal 
beyond the embryonic stage, sim-
ilar to the illegality of abortion 
after roughly 12 weeks. The bill 
should make it explicit that a 
woman would not be charged 
should she harm her own fetus in 
the procedure of abortion. This is 
the only way to affirm that Roe v. 
Wade was not fought only to be 
torn apart years later. This is the 
only way to make sure that Roe v. 
Wade was not fought for in vain. 

Events have shown that this 
bill will indeed prove to be one of 
many changes made by the Bush 

. administration. However, if the 
past few months were merely a 
preview into the next four years, I 
advise you all to brace yourselves 
because it is going to be one hell 
of a rocky ride. Meanwhile, all we 
can do is hope that the Senate 
stops the buck.

In the past, when I wrote

determine which groups I would

I would check them off. Then, rather

'N~w' McVeigh Files 
Not So New After All 

WASHINGTON - The discov-
ery of thousands of pages of undis-
closed evidence in the Timothy j. 
McVeigh case had its origins in the 
closing days of last year, in what 
one law enforcement official this 
weekend described as a routine 
effort to "have a final cleanup." 

By last week, senior officials say, 
they had realized for the first time 
that there were 3,135 pages con-
nected with the Oklahoma City 
bombing case that had never been 

on April 19, 1995. Daniel 
Defenbaugh, the senior bureau 
agent assigned to the case, who had 
subsequently been named the top 
agent in the Dallas office, was in 
charge of the clean-up effort. 

By late February, bureau 
archivists found themselves dealing 
with about 100 boxes received 
from 43 FBI offices around the 
country and overseas. Initially, it 
seemed that the documents were 
indeed duplicates of those logged 

turned over to 
McVeigh's lawyers. 

"He never thought 
any of this stuff 
had an impact 

before and turned 
over to McVeigh's 
lawyers, as every-
one had assumed. 

But they soon 
began to discern a 
problem. By March, 
they had informed 

on McVeigh or 
NichoLs." 

As a result of 
that discovery, the 
execution of Mc-
Veigh , scheduled 
for Wednesday, was 
postponed until at 
least June 11 by 
Attorney General 
John Ashcroft. 
Ashcroft and the 
FBI, reeling from 

Defenbaugh that 
there appeared to 

- Law enforcement be a number of 

the embarrassment of the serious 
mishandling of the largest domes-
tic anti-terrorism case in the 
nation 's history, were scrambling to 
figure out what happened. 

Senior law enforcement officials 
in the Bush administration, giving 
their version of what they have 
been able to reconstruct so far, say 
there is no evidence that the docu-
ments were deliberately withheld 
by anyone. That conclusion has 
not, however, been tested by 
lawyers for McVeigh, who have yet 
to examine the documents and give 
their view of the significance of the 
discovery. 

The officials said in interviews 
that in late December an unsigned 
message was sent from FBI head-
quarters in Washington to the 
bureau's 56 field offices, instructing 
them to send in to headquarters 
any items in the files related to the 
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah 
Federal Building in Oklahoma City 

Power: 
Energy industry invests 
in different markets 
Continued from page 1 
of them intended to protect the 
environment, that Bush adminis-
tration officials say have caused an 
alarming gap in energy supplies. 

Vice President Dick Cheney, 
who leads the task force charged 
with drafting the energy plan, has 
urged urgent government action to 
correct supply shortages. 

But the latest statistics from 
government and industry analysts 
show the energy industry shifting 
into high gear, investing heavily in 
areas that were seen as unattractive 
just a few years ago. Thus even 
before the government has eased 
any regulations, even as high ener-
gy prices create a sense of crisis in 
Washington, the investment boom 
pr.omises ~ cyclical increase in sup-
plies that IS expected to stabi lize or 
reduce prices in coming months, 
many industry executives and pri-
vate analysts say. 

"Prices go up and we start 
drilling: says jerry Jordan, whose 
company in Columbus, Ohio, plans 
to dig 10 to 20 natural gas wells this 
year. For now, he says. there is plen-
ty of natural gas available and "we're 
going to get it to the market: 

Bush said on Friday that gaso-
line prices were high because 

officla' documents that had 
not been previously 

listed. In response to the archivists' 
discovery, Defenbaugh went to 
Oklahoma City to meet with them. 

At about this time, J~tice 
Department officials were deeply 
involved in making complicated 
arrangements to put McVeigh to 
death , the first federal execution in 
38 years. 

justice Department officials said 
they did not believe Defenbaugh 
informed his superiors that there 
might have been a serious problem 
involving documents that were not 
disclosed to the defense. 

"He never thought any of this 
stuff had any impact on McVeigh 
or Nichols: one law enforcement 
official said, referring to McVeigh 
and Terry Nichols, a co-defendant 
in the bombing who was convicted 
and sentenced to life in prison.

refineries, which administration 
officials said had been hobbled by 
environmental laws, could not 
increase output. "The reason why 
we have problems at the gas pump 
is that we have not built any more 
refineries: Bush said. 

While some experts agree with 
Bush, others on Wall Street see it dif-
ferently. Several investment analysts 
recently downgraded the stocks of 
leading refining companies because 
they have produced so much gaso-
line recently, possibly sending prices 
south by midsummer. 

Bush and Cheney have often 
cited high prices as evidence that 
industry cannot meet demand 
because regulations make it too 
hard to increase supply. Industry 
officials have applauded the focus 
on streamlining regulations that 
they consider costly to comply 
with. But many acknowledge that 

tho~e complaints have little to do 
with the price of gas today. 

The reality of energy markets 
have gotten lost "in the politics of 
the moment," says Ken Cohen, vice 
president of public affairs for 
Exxon Mobil Corp. in Irving, Texas. 
The company would like to see 
environmental regulations become 
m6re predictable, he said. "But the 
market isn't broken. If you let the 
markets work, the markets will 
clear," or meet demand.

Cheney Is Emerging as a Power Broker 
WASHINGTON - A dozen 

House Republicans from 
California were seething when 
they met with Vice President Dick 
Cheney on May 1 to discuss the 
state's power crisis. 

Angry that Gray Davis, the 
state's Democratic governor, was 
trying to pin the blame for the 
problem on Republicans, the law-
makers urged the White House to 
fire back. Cheney, a former House 
leader, listened patiently as the 
lawmakers encouraged him and 
the White House to attack Davis, 
before tersely cutting off the 
clamor. 

"It's not part of the White 
House strategy and it won't be," 
Rep. George P. Radanovich 
recalled Cheney saying. 

As quickly as he silenced talk 
of one option, the vice president 
rekindled discussion of others. 
Could the government tell its 
offices in California to conserve 
energy? legislators asked 
Cheney. A few days later, 
President Bush ordered federal 
offices in the state to lower their 
thermostats. 

"You talk to Dick Cheney and 
things happen, and he doesn't 

necessarily take credit: said Sen. 
nent Lott, the majority leader. 
"There is a connection between 
going to Dick Cheney and getting 
action." 

Cheney has emerged as a 
power broker within the Bush

and things happen, and 
he doesn't necessarily 
take credit. "

administration and - more than 
any vice president before him -
between the White House and 
Capitol Hill. It is a role Bush 
planned for Cheney, the 60-year-
old former secretary of defense 
and White House chief of staff 
with impeccable conservative cre-
dentials, when he picked him as 
his political partner. But Cheney 
has proved to be even more influ-
ential than was imagined during 
the campaign. 

As President Bush's consiglieri. 
Cheney helps connect the dots for 

the administration as he zigzags all 
day long from hot-button issue to 
high-level meeting, discreetly 
imparting advice whenever his boss 
asks or needs to know. 

Behind the scenes, Cheney 
urged Bush to follow up quickly 
and unequivocally on his cam-
paign pledge to build a':l expan-
sive missile defense system. Last 
week, Bush gave that commit-
ment in a major speech. 

"Because of the way the vice 
president operates, in a rather 
low-profile way, I think his influ-
ence oftentimes is substantially 

underes~imated," said Sen. Larry 
E. Craig, R-Idaho. "His finger-
prints are everywhere." 

Critics say Cheney'S operating 
style suggests that Bush is a fig-
urehead and Cheney is the real 
man in charge. That is a percep-
tion the vice president rejects. "I 
see him several times a day, but 
that's what the president wanted 
when he asked me to be his run-
ning mate: Cheney said in a tele-
vision interview last month.

Broken Hearts in Chechnyan War 
GROZNY, Russia - Every war 

has its angels, and some of them 
live here in the ruined capital of 
Chechnya. 

"When the bombing would 
start and the fragments would 
come down like rain, we would 
gather the patients and run into the 
building: said Zina Tavgiyeva , 
chief nurse of the Katayama home 
for the aged and infirm. "Everyone 
was crying. and I told them to pray 
to God and that he would save us." 

When the bombing stopped, as 
Russian troops tried to retake 
control of the breakaway region, 
"we would go back to the bonfire" 
in the courtyard to get warm. 
Patients cut one another's hair to 
combat the lice that spread with-
out sanitation. The demented 
wandered about, but other 
patients looked out for them. 

When Russia 's military cam-
paign against Chechen rebels 
intruded behind these walls in the 
fall of 1999, a handful of nurses 
and their supporters in Moscow 
rallied public concern for the fate 
of about 100 patients whose home 
had been this institution. Some 

Germany: 
Turks constitute largest 
German immigrant group 
ContInued from PIP 1 
election. "Germany is not a classic 
country of immigration, and 
because of its history, geography 
and economic conditions, it can-
not be one," the party said in a 
new policy paper. 

It did not define what classic 
means here - although party 
officials say it is a reference to 
countries like the United States 
that were formed by immigration. 
But even this statement is a depar-
ture from the party's long-held 
position under the former chan-
cellor, Helmut Kohl, that 
Germany was not a land of immi-
gration - classic or otherwise. 

The Christian Democrats, try-
ing to put pressure on the govern-
ing Social Democrats who have 

were elderly, others severely hand-
icapped, demented or bedridden. 
Most were ethnic Russians - and 
dozens had paired off like married 
couples over the years, as happens 
in such cloistered worlds. 

The Katayama patients suf-
fered even more from the Russian 
military'S assault on the Chechen 
capital than other residents 
because the patients were trapped 
here until December 1999. They 
witnessed three months of intense 
bombing that incinerated most of 
their institution. 

When a rescue operation for 
the patients was finally mounted, 
to carry them to neighboring 
Ingushetia, six died from cold and 
malnutrition on the way. But the 
worst thing this war brought to 
the residents of Katayama was a 
separation for which no one had 
prepared them. 

Early last year, Russia 's Health 
and Social Welfare Ministries 
ordered that the ethnic Russians 
among the patients were to be 
reassigned to other institutions. 
Only the Chechen patients were 
to be sent back to the war zone. 

not yet clarified their position, sug-
gested for the first time that annu-
al quotas for the admission of for-
eigners needed in the job market 
should be set, but insisted that all 
foreigners must adhere to "the val-
ues of our Christian culture." 

Dropping its explosive call last 
year for foreigners to accept a 
German leitkultur, or guiding cul-
ture. but retaining the gist of this 
appeal, the party said adherence 
to German norms and the avoid-
ance of "parallel societies" was 
essential. The very mention of the 
word multiculturalism at 
Christian Democrats meetings 
these days tends to provoke hoots 
of disdain. 

"Our Christian culture, 
marked by Christianity, ancient 
philosophy, humanism, Roman 
law and the Enlightenment, must 
be accepted: the Christian 
Democrats said. "That does not 
mean abandonment of particular 
religious and cultural practices, 

"We took out 100 and brought 
back 11." said Tamara Oibayeva, a 
staff nurse. 

That was crushing news for 
some of the couples, and also for 
old friends. It was especially hard 
on a 68-year-old patient named 
Slavik, a one-legged former torpe-
doman with a vodka problem who 
was living with Natasha, a Russian 
pensioner. Slavik was deeply dis-
traught because he had been 
forced to return from Ingushetia 

â¢ without the womanÂ· he loved. 
"I am dying without her: he 

said as he hobbled through the 
burned-out upper floor. "I don't 
know how to live without 
Natasha - I won't live without 
her: he said. 

Slavik may have meant what he 
said, because a few weeks later, he 
picked up pension payments and 
left this place, setting off on crutch-
es through the bomb craters to 
find his Natasha. He was last seen 
wearing his coral-colored track 
suit, one leg pinned up,. 

- Patrick E. Tyler 
The New York TImes 

but acceptance of our values and 
organization for living together: 

The party's statement - its 
platforrn on immigration for the 
2002 elections - comes as a com-
mission appointed by Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder and including 
representatives of most political 
parties is preparing to issue its 
report this surJ11her. In effect. the 
Christian Democrats are trying to 
preempt the chancellor's initiative. 

By far the largest single group 
of immigrants in Germany are 
Turks, who first came as "guest 
workers" more than 30 years ago 
and now number more than 2 mil-
lion, or more than all the foreign -
ers in Germany from European 
Union countries put together. 
Because they are overwhelmingly ' 
Islamic, the Turks tend to regard 
calls for adherence to Christian 
norms as a provocation.

Scripps Team Discovers Link 
Between Waves and Climate 
Scientists finds that whitecaps reflect solar radiation 
By LARA MOSCRIP 
Staff Writer 

Researchers from the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography 
released the conclusions of a five-
year project Monday, explaining 
the impact of ocean whitecaps on 
global climate - a relationship 
that has never been considered in 
the makings of previous climate 
models used to predict and 
explain climate change. 

Scripps scientists Robert 
Frouin and Sam lacobellis and 
their collaborator Pierre-Yves 
Desthamps of the Laboratoire 
d'Optique Atmospherique in 
France. studied the effects of 
whitecaps, which form when wave 
crests break, and how their pres-
ence can affect the amount of 
radiation that reaches the surface 
of the ocean. 

Under conditions like a clear, 
cloudless sky and great wind speed, 
whitecaps can occur and can reflect 
solar radiation away from the sur-
face of the ocean. The levels of 
reflected radiation have been 
recorded as high as .7 wans per 
meter squared in the Indian Ocean. 

According to lacobellis, this is 
particularly significant because in 
such cases, "whitecaps might be 
important players in evaluating how 
regions respond to climate change." 

According to Frouin, the next 
logical step in the continuation of 
their studies is to create climate 
models and compare how the 

presence or absence of whitecaps 
affects different models. 

"Hopefully we've shown that 
whitecaps should be included in 
climate models," lacobellis stated. 

Frouin explains, "The next step 
is to run climate models with and 
without the whitecap effect on 
surface albedo, and analyze the 
differences between the results of 
the two runs." 

Frouin also said that these 
experimen ts may help explain 
how whitecaps and global warm-
ing are related. 

"This !c1imate model! will 
quantify the impact of whitecaps 
on climate and climate change; 
how whitecaps might edge off 
globa l warming," he said. 

However, Frouin noted th3t 
pinpointing whether greenhous~ 
gases and global warming actually 
affect wind speed and the pres-
ence of whitecaps, which in turn 
determine how much radiation 
whitecaps reflect, is uncertain. 

He acknowledged that in com-
parison to certain greenhouse 
gases, the presence of whitecaps 
and their ability to produce cli-
mate change is small. However, 
Frouin notes that the whitecaps 
may playa role in climate change. 

"In contrast to well .. mixed 
greenhouse gases, whitecaps are 
more localized and their forcing 
may be much larger on regional 
and seasonal scales, with definite 
effects on climate," Frouin said.

Al though the results of thm 
study have been published sinc ... 
mid-April, Frouin believes that 
the reaction of his pt'ers cannot

"It is a little carly yet to giluge 
the reaction from the research 
community," Frouin said. "We 
hope that our results will t'ncour-
age climate modelers to include 
the radiative effects of whitecaps 
into their computational models."

EATU 
Editor's Note: Before you go running off and trying to 

brew your own beer; use your head. Malting moonshine in 
your bathtub can lead to serious health, as well as legal prob-
lems. We don't encourage underage drinking. 

'5 un God is just around the comer. You've 
. , read the Guardian beer issue and are psy-

:- ched about getting piss-drunk on Friday, 
but you've got a problem. Either you're 
underage and can't buy beer, or you're of 

age, but broke. Either way, this sweet nectar is simply 
out of your grasp. 

Rather than sulking, you should have been plan-
ning ahead. If you had actually taken a few moments 
to think about it, you would have come up with the 
perfect solution: brewing your own beer. 

In addition to having a slew of alcohol at your dis-
posal, you could probably sell a lot of it to beer-hun-
gry freshmen (a lthough we at the Guardian do not 
condone such things, as stated in the editor's note) 
and make yourself a nice profit. Brewing beer could 
actually tum into quite a lucrative business - just ask 
At Capone. 

While making beer is a very involved process, this 

FEATURES 11 

is an attempt to simplify the process and give you a 
glimpse as to what it takes to brew your own suds. 
" ..... Ion 

According to John Palmer's "How to Brew Your 
First B.eer," ~here are three key things that you mu~t 
keep m mmd throughout . the brewing process. 
These are cleanliness, preparation and good record 
keeping. Without these, you might as well be drink-
ing rubbing alcohol. because the beer you make will 
taste awful. 

Cleanliness is very important in the brewing 
process. Since brewing beer involves providing a 
healthy environment for the yeast to grow and fer-
ment, it also leaves the door wide open for bacteria to 

If you're tired of having to 'choke 
down nasty beer for big bucks, just 
check out this guide to. brewing 
your own 

form and grow. Lack of cleanliness can lead to entire 
batches of ruined beer. 

Preparation is another key to brewing good beer. 
This includes having all of the ingredients ready, hav-
ing your equipment clean and being ready to execute 
the brewing steps in a timely manner. Leaving the 
yeast out too lon~ while you wait to clean the fer-
menter can cause It to go bad. 

The final key to brewing a good batch of beer, 
according to Palmer, is record keeping. The brewer 
should Reep track of the amounts of the ingredients 
that were used as well as how much time was spent in ~ ~ 
each process. The purpose of the extensive record ~ ~ 
keeping is to allow good batches to be duplicated in \ j1 \ ~ 
future endeavors and to learn from bad batches. } \ .. _..,. - _1) : 
_I ..... t \\ \ .. -

As nice as it would be to simply be able to look <:MY l. ~ A 
around the house, grab a few items and be ready f0(1 V r-
brewing, that simply isn 't the case. r~ 

Several pieces of equipment must be pur- , 
chased prior to beginning the brewing process. J 
Again, this goes back to the preparation aspect of -"" 
brewing. 

Three of the biggest pieces of equipment are the 
ai rlock, boiling pot and fermenter. The airlock comes 
in several styles and should be filled to the water line 
with bleach water. The boiling pot should be stainless 
steel, ceramic-coated steel or aluminum. It should be 
able to hold a minimum of three -gallons of liquid. The 
fermenter is a large container. A six-gallon food-grade 
plastic PIIil is recommended for beginners (that 
means you). 

Next on the list are two cases of recappable 12-
ounce bottles. Heavy glass bottles are recom-
mended. Twist-off caps are not advisable. [n 
addition to the bottles, you should purchase a 
bottle brush to scrub out the bottles, bottle 
caps (either standard or oxygen absorbing) 
and a bottl\! capper (either a hand cap- ~ .... ",..-_ 

by Josh Crouse, 
per or a bench capper) . You should also 
purchase a bottle filler, which is a hard 
plastic, or sometimes metal , tube 
that has a spring-loaded valve to fill 
the bottles. 

Additionally, you will need to 
purchase a siphon hose, which is a 
clear, plastic tubing; a racking cane, 
which is a rigid, plastic tube with a 
sediment stand-off; a stirrin$ paddle, 
which is a food-grade plastic paddle 
or spoon and a thermometer that has 
a range of at least 40 degrees 
Fahrenheit to 1 SO degrees Fahrenheit.

TheEditor'sSoo pbox 
By BRIAN WIKNER 
Web Editor 

I was walking to my Tuesday 
afternoon political science class at 
Peterson Hall the other day when I 
saw something truly amusing. As I 
made my way across the winding 
cement paths in front of the Sun 
God, I saw what appeared to be a 
life-sized paper mache army figu re 
toting a bazooka over its shoulder. 
It appeared to be taking aim at the 
Sun God and was sporting a T-
shirt with something to the effect 
of"UCSD Administration" painted 
on the back. 

Surrounding the figure was a 
series of golf tees and holes, essen-
tially trying to convey that student 
fees are being funneled into the 
already rich pockets of the regents 
and administration. 

A similar anti;administra tion 
protest took place during Admit 
Day. I was showing my brother 
around the campus and decided to 
attend the "Welcome to UCSD" 
lecture offered on the hour. Just 
before Vice Chancellor Joseph 
Watson and others were set to 
begin speaking, the stage was 
rushed by a protester. Before a 
crowd of hundreds of potential 
students and their fami lies. he 
explained that the administration 
was a greedy. cold-hearted beast 
that cared only for its corporate 
interests and not for students. He 
also asserted that UCS D was a 
"very political campus." I had trou-
ble containing my laughter. 

This diatribe was followed by a 
brief chant wi th fe llow protesters 
scattered throughout the audience. 
"UCSD equals corporate greed: 
they half-heartedly repeated, sens-
ing that the crowd of anxious par-
ents was getting agitated by the 
outburst. They eventually left, 
allowing the lecture to continue. 

So why do I bring these two 
instances up? Is it because it's the 
most political activity UCS D has 
seen since the 1960s? o. Is it 
because paper mache army men give 
you something fun to look at on the 
walk to Peterson? ot exactly. 

More than anyth ing, I'm 
prompted to write and address the 
id iocy of these events. Over the 
pas t month, there have been 
protests and articles in this news-
paper damning the administration 
and any form of bureaucracy as the 
tool of capitalist greed and corpo-
rate manipulation. Come on. are 
we rea lly that fool ish? 

Let's take a look at where this 
all begins - Marxism and the 
undeniably profound work of~The 
Communist Manifesto." The 1848 
treatise is effectively Marx and 
Engel's critique of 19th century 

Brewing:

including five to seven pounds of 
hopped pale malt extract syrup, five 
gallons of water, one to two ounces 
of hops, one packet of dry ale yeast 
and three-fourths of a cup of com 
sugar. 

The malt extract syrup consists 
of 'concentrated sugars removed 
from malted barley. According to 
Palmer, a rule of thumb is one 
pound of malt extract syrup per 
gallo n of water to produce a light-
bodied beer. The water is very 
important in the beer-making 
process. It should be boiled befpre 
use to kill any chlorine or bacteria 
in the water. Brewers should also 
avo id distilled water since the 
minerals are what gives the beer

Attention QuaSi-Marxists: 
Let's Try Critical Thought for 
a Change 

European society. The manifesto 
was written in the midst of the 
Industria l Revolution, when the 
interests of the manufacturing elite 
were continually adverse to those 
of the workers. It was, as Marx put 
it ~shame l ess, direct. bru ta l 
exploitation." 

It seems, however, that these 
modern readers of the manifesto 
have discounted the context of the 
work. Taken aback by the passion- ' 
ate prose that invokes a spirit of 
indignation and self-righteousness. 
they have effectively attempted to 
transpose Marx's world to the one 
we live in. 

This isn't to say that we should 
walk through life with the naive 
belief that corporate interests serve 
those of the population. A cautious 
skepticism of all faceless. power-
welding entities - whether corpora-
tions or government - is a hea lthy 
practice in any free-thinking society. 

What these protests illustrate is 
the tendency of anti-corporate left-
ists to adopt a catch-all ideology, 

What these protests 
illustrate is the tendency 
of anti-corporate leftists 
to adopt a catch-all 
ideology, such as class 
struggle, in place of 
critical thought. Clearly, 
it is easier to demonize 
capitalism than to search 
for explanations that 
more effectively address 
the issue. 
such as class struggle, in place of 
cri tical thought. Clearly, it is easier 
to demonize capitalism than to 
search for explanations that more 
effectively address the issue. 

Instead of rudely dis rupting 
hundreds of parents and students 
on Admit Day and discouraging 
enrollment at UCSD. these protest-
ers could have found a more ratio-
nal and credible approach. If you 
want to be mindful of the adminis-
tration, fonn a watchdog group of 
concerned students and monitor 
the cash flow of the university -
UCSD is a public institution and all 
records have to be disclosed. 

If there is something fishy going 
on, write a letter to the Guardian 
and create some commotion with 
your evidence. Sure, it's not as easy 
as making paper mache dolls and a 
nine-hole golf course in front of 
Muir college, but researching the 
hard truth shouldn't be. 

flavor and allows the yeast to 
grow. . 

Hops comes in two main cate-
gories: bittering and aroma. The 
bittering hops contain more alpha 
acids, which give the beer its bitter 
taste. For the purposes of this 
recipe, bittering hops should be 
used. 

Aside from hops, yeast is the 
next most important thing' in 
determining the flavor of the 
beer. There are several different 
types of yeast, including dry and 
wet, ale and lager and so on. A 
dry ale yeast is to be used for this 
recipe. 
TIM Proc:eM 

The brewing should start by 
rehydrating the dry yeast. This is a 
relatively simple process that 
involves putting a cup of warm (90 
degrees Fahrenheit) boiled water 
into a sterilized jar that contains 
the yeast. The jar should be cov-
ered in plastic wrap and left for 1 0 

I respect Ralph ader for this 
very reason. I can't recall a TV or 
radio appearance where ader 
unleashed a criticism of corporate 
America using archaic. Marxist max-
ims. His concerns over the excessive 
money and corporate interests in 
our political system have always 
been based on solid, well -reasoned 
arguments. Say what you will about 
his politics, at least his criti isms go 
deeper than an ingrained hatred of 
the establishment. 

This contrasts what happened 
during Admit Day. Upon interrupt-
ing one of the speakers. a protester 
was told that he could address the 
audience at the conclusion of the 
current speech. Rather than articu-
late the position of the protest in a 
credible and diplomatic manner. the 
protester denied the invitation and 
shouted anti-administration slurs as 
he was booed out of the Price 
Center Ballroom. Not only did the 
protest fail to gamer support. it cre-
ated a backlash against it and its fun-
damental ideological basco 

Marx's critique of 19th-century 
Europe was an innovative and 
thoughtful examinati n of a society 
amid rapid change. The criticisms 
recently expressed against the 
administration embody a similar 
form, but lack the substance and 
circumstance of their predecessors 

These pseudO-Marxists scream 
to the heavens agains t corporate 
evils, administrative greed and the 
exploitation of students, but 
denounce the opportun ity to 
engage in discourse over these 
concerns. Instead, they formulate 
arguments composed of lofty 
rhetoric and simpleton art projects. 

Because I am an employee of 
the Guardian, these people are like-
ly to write off anything I say about 
thei r activities. After all , the check I 
receive for this- art icle will come 
from the university, the oppressive 
and malicious entity that has been 
keeping us all down. I'm just a pro-
pagandist of the administration. 

Let me offer a more thoughtful 
explanation. This Editor's Soapbox 
is a contribution to the dialogue 
and free exchange of ideas on this 
campus, not a four-word protest 
chant or an oversimpl ified view of a 
complex issue. I'm not writing this 
because I'm a "wage slave: or 
because I'm being exploited by the 
university. It's a matter of express-
ing ideas in a constructi ve and 
thoughtful way. 

If you disagree with what I've 
said, write a letter to the editor; 
don 't just show up at the Guardian 
office with a paper mache effigy of 
me with "dumb" written on it in 
crayon. This is a u'liversity - we 
should be able to do better than 
that. 

minutes. 
After the 10 minutes you 

should stir in a teaspoon of sugar 
and then recover the jar and place 
it in a warm area out of the sun-
light. The yeast will be ready after 
thirty minutes and should be 
actively churning and foaming. 

While rehydrating the yeast, 
you should begin the brewing 
process by boiling two and a half 
gallons of water in a large pot. 
When the water comes to a boil, 
remove it from the heat and add 
the wort while being careful not 
to let any of it stick to the bot-
tom. 

The pot should now be put 
back in the heat and brought to a 
boil. You should keep a constant 
eye on the pot and stir it frequent-
ly. It should remain at a boil for an 
hour.

the oracle than I am able to here, 
there are several good volumes 
available at the GClsel Library as 
well as numerous online resources. 
Feel free to contact me at 
Zopyra@zensearch.net for guidance, 
or with any question I can ask the 
oracle for you. 

For the seventh week of the 
UCSD spring quarter, beginning 
May 14, I will focus on one 

inquiry of great significance to 
many. I do this partly in respect to 
the magnitude of the question 
and the Oracle's response, and 
partly to make transparent the 
process I use to consult the 
Oracle. 

Dear Zopyra, every time spring 
rolls around, I get very nervous 
about my housing situation. On 
top of finishing this school year, I 
have to find a place to live for the 
next. What can I do? 

I asked "What is the best course 
of action to secure housing in the 
San Diego area for next year?" 

To ask this question, I wrote it 
on a papyrus book I use for all my 
inquiries, noting the date and 
place. Tradition for I-Ching read-
ings requires both a silk cloth on 
which to lay all the tools of divina-
tion and incense to call the spirits 
and focus the mind. 

The divination itself consists of 
manipulating 50 yarrow stalks, or 
other thin sticks of even length if 
yarrow is unavailable, in a precise 
series of separations and combina-

tions. Splitting the stalks between 
two hands prevents conscious con-
trol over the outcome, as there are 
too many stalks for the eye to 
coun t at once. 

The bunched stalks are split 
and regrouped 18 times. The 
results from three splittings com-
bine to produce a line, either bro-
ken or unbroken , in the Kua. 
which is the nucleus of the Oracle's 
judgements. The Kua is also called 
a Hexagram because it is made by 
six lines. The lines are drawn one 
above the other, with thc first to 
appear on the bottom. The only 
significant features of a line, deter-
mined by the splitting of the stalks. 
are whether it is broken or solid 
and whether it is new and static or 
old and about to switch to its 
opposite. 

If you will fi nd pen and paper I 
will guide you through drawing 
the Hexagram I received as judge-
ment for my inquiry. Write the 
number 6 in the top left corner of 

See !-CHING, Page 15

I-Ching: 
This week's questions are 
answered by Zopyra 
Continued from .,... 13 
your paper. Below that, write 5, 
and below that 4, and so on to 1. 

ext to the 1, draw a horizontal 
1-centimeter line, then leave a 1-
centimeter gap, then continue the 
line for another centimeter. Place 
a dot at the end of this old. broken 
line. 

Next to the 2. draw an old bro-
ken line just the same way. Next to 
the 3, draw a new broken line, 
which is the same 3-centimeter line 
with a gap in the middle as before 
but without a dot at the end. Draw 
another new broken line next to 
the 4. 

Line 5 is a new solid line. so 
draw a horizontal 3-centimeter 
line above the others. Line 6 is a 
new broken Â·Iine, the same as line 
3 and 4. You have drawn 
Hexagram 8, the Kua of Holding 
Together, with an old broken line 
in the first a nd second place, 
which will soon become solid and 
produce Hexagram 60, the Kua of 
Setting Limitations. 

The original Kua for the 64 1-
Ching Hexagrams was composed 
by Fu Hsi at least 6,000 years ago. 
The fi rst written versions appeared 
in China around 3,000 B.C. I use 
four different English interpreta-
tions by Wu Wei, Wu Jing-Nuan, 
Richard Wilhelm and Wang Bi. As I 
take up each in tum for this read-
ing, I read the text for Hexagram 8, 
then for lines 1 and 2 of that 
Hexagram and finally the text for 
Hexagram 60. 

The beauty of the Oracle is that 
beyond the summary judgements 
of the 64 Hexagrams, the old lines 

. provide a window into the' particu-
lar transitions between the present 
moment and the next. 

In this case, the Wu Wei judge-
ment of Hexagram 8 seems imme-
diately applicable: "Joining, sup-

Solutions on page 16 

porting. or uniting individuals into 
a group brings good fortune 
because members of the group 
support each other. Waiting too 
long to join. support, or gather a 
group brings danger." 

This pronouncement reads 
plainly as an endorsement of 
group living situations - of 
assembling a party to find shared 
housing. The Oracle suggests that 
this solution may be best for the 
present moment in San Diego 
housing. This judgement will be 
enhanced by the rest of the 
Oracle's response. 

Line 1 of Hexagram 8 is clearest 
from Wu Wei: "You are just begin-
ning and stand alone. The utmost 
importance is placed in being sin-
cere, which will bring you good for-
tune from an unexpected source. 
Holding hidden, devious motives 
brings misfortune." 

Here is sound advice for anyone 
seeking to form a group for shared 
housing. Line 2, as interpreted by 
Wu Jing-Nuan. takes this theme 
further: "Although [Hexagram 8) 
shows two men united. or two men 
walking together, the instruction is 
that union must come from with-
in." 

Turning fi nally to Hexagram 
60, Setting Limitations, the Oracle 
points to the best process for 
achievi ng sincerity and radiant 
harmony in th is situation. Richard 
Wilhelm provides this: "Where 
limitation is applied in the cre-
ation of institutions, property is 
not encroached upon, and people 
are not harmed." The Oracle sug-
gests that this favorable outcome 
for shared housing resul ts from 
the balanc;e of knowi ng and 
acknowledgi ng one's own limits 
while preserving loyalty to the 
group. 

I invite you to consider this 
challenge for the next week, when I 
will revisit this judgement and 
explore two more.

kind, contact me at

Brewing: 
Bottling the beer is the 
final step in the process 
Continued from page 12 
boil (5 to 20 minutes), there might 
be a foam that forms at the top of 
the pot. making a smooth surface. 
This is normal. T he only th ing to 
watch out for is it boil ing over. In 
order to keep this in check. you can 
adjust the heat. or as Palmer sug-
gests. use a spray bottle full of 
water. 

The next stage of the brewing 
process is a crucial one: the cooling 
of the wort. 

While bacteria will not form at 
tempera tures over 130 degrees 
Â·Fahrenheit. it is very likely between 
80 degrees and 130 degrees. For 
this reason . the wort must be 
cooled below .80 degrees 
Fahrenheit at a rapid pace. 

This can be accomplished sev-
eral ways. Palmer suggests placing 
the large pot in a tub of ice-cold 
water circulating around it. Stir the 
wort while it c ools. It should get 
below 80 degrees Fahrenheit in 
approximately 20 minutes. The pot 
may still be warm to the touch . but 
it will be OK. 

N ow you should add the 
remaining 2 1-2 gallons of water to 
the fermenter and add the wort to 
that. You should allow it to splash 
into the fe rmenter. allowing it to 
oxidize. 

The mixture is now ready to 
ferment at a tempe~ature between 
6S degrees to 7S degrees 
Fahrenhei t. 

At this point. you need to tak" 
the dry yeast that you rehydrated 
and add it all into the fermenter 
with the wort. Instead of placing 
the airlock on the fermenter. sim-
ply apply plastic wrap and shake 
the fermenter. allowing the wort to 
mix in with the yeast. 

The airlock should then be 
added and the fermenter and left 
alone in a protected area like a 
bathtub. Active fermentation 
should start within 12 hours. 

A constant temperature of 
approximately _ 70 degrees 
Fahrenheit should be maintained. 
For ale beer. the primary fermenta-
tion should be done in approxi -
mately three days at that tempera-
ture. However. the beer should be 
left alone for two to three weeks to 
allow it to go through its final fer-
mentation process. 

After this process. you are 
almost ready to bottle your beer. 
but first you need to prime it. 

This is done by boiling three-
fourths of a cup of corn sugar or 
1 1-4 cups of dry malt extract into 
some water and letting it cool. 
T he mixture can then be added 
into the fermenter and stirred into 
the beer. 

Wait half ao hour before 
siphoning the beer into the bottles. 

You should fill the bottles until 
three-quarters of an inch from the 
top and ( ap them. The bottles 
should be placed out of direct sun-
light. in room temperature. for a 
minimum f one week. 

After ' .:al. enjoy the sweet nec-
tar that you slaved so hard for. It 
wi ll all be worth it in the end.

The UCSD triathlon team com-
peted in the 2001 Jamba Juice 
Wildflower Triathlon on Sunday, 
May 6. It was the National Colle-
giate Championship event and 
attracted over 50 schools and 500 
athletes from around the nation. 

Competing in temperatures in 
the low 90s, the UCSD team over-
came fatigue and placed eighth on 
the basis of the total tim~s of its 
top three male and female finish-

deserve all the credit in the world. 
So here's to all of those soccer

not survive without you. 

Here 's to all of you mothers out

ciation is due for all you have done

placed it behind University of 
Colorado-Boulder, UC Berkeley, 
Stanford, Cal Poly San Luis Opis-
bo, University of Florida, UCSB 
and Navy. 

Despite one Triton involved in 
an accident and another with ter-
minal bike failure, all members of 
the UCSD team were able to finish 
the race. Esther Merki, one of the 
top finishers for the Tritons, fin-
ished with a time of 2:33: 18, which 
placed her fifth out of a total of 198 
female competitors.

Triton Volleyball Players Say Goodbye 
Four key players have played their last game 'in the blue and gold 
By SCOTT BURROUGHS 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's volleyball team 
showed a massive amount of heart 
and spirit throughout its grueling 
2000-2001 campaign. It was hard to 
battle with scholarShip-dangling 
Division I and Division II volleyball 
powerhouses, but the Tritons man-
aged to persevere all season long. 

This type of gritty, heartfelt play 
could not have happened without 
the four Triton seniors who are 
wrapping up their UCSD careers 
this season. These four men pro-
vided courage, athleticism, leader-
ship and spirit to a team that had 
few victories, but did have a whole 
lot of fun. 

Courtesy of UCSD Athlerlcs Graduating seniors Zach Hite, 
Donald Chen. Todd Tarpley and 
Kevin Flynn will not be back on the 
hardwood in Triton blue and gold 
next season. They are moving on to 
lives where volleyball will be a hobby 
instead of a lifestyle, a game to be 
played on the beach or in the park, 
not the trenches of RlMAC or other 
college arenas around the country. 

Cillo: Chen, Tarpley, Flynn, and Hire are li1king their skills and determination fa the greener pastures of the real world beyond UC5D's campus. 

The hardwood will no longer 
echo with the booming smashes of 
these fine players. nor will it echo 
with applause for their on-court 
prowess. They came, they saw, they 
played some darn good volleyball 
and now they are leaving UCSD in 
their wake. 

Chen is the type .of player every 
coach would like to have: an athlete 
with the ability to dominate a game 
on his own terms. Never one to 
voice his own extraordinary accom-
plishments, his humbleness 
impressed his teammates and 
coaches. 

Coach Ron Larsen knew he had 
something special in Chen. 

"He was probably the best volley-
ball player to ever play at UCSD; 
Larsen said, referring .10 Chen. "He 
was great offensively - a very explo-
sive player who was the focal point 
of our offense. We will definitely 
miss him next year. Off the court he 
was quiet, he would work hard and 
really wanted to get bener, but on 
the court he was a big presence. He 
was just a very athletic. very talented 
player." 

Chen was often complemented 
on the court by fellow standout 
senior Hite. 

Larsen explains Hite's impact as 
a Triton volleyball player: "Zach was 
a complete volleyball player - not 
all that big at 6'2", but with just an 
explosive arm; he said. "He was a 

good defensive player, our primary 
passer. He could always hit the ball 
hard. He was a good competitor that 
really got involved in the games. As 
one of our team captains. he was 
always available to help his team-
mates, too. Organizing things and 
helping out a lot with all the things 
we had to off the court. He was a real 
role model." 

Tarpley is another Triton senior 
who's hanging up his UCSD uni-
form. 

Though he played a smaller role 
than Chen and Hite, Tarpley still 
made his presence felt. 

"Todd was a starter last year, but 
this year he had more of a backup 
role at center, but he knew the game 
as well as anybody; Larsen said. "He 
really knew the game and knew how 
to play it well. He did all he could for 

the team, always supportive and 
always there for his teammates even 
when he wasn't always playing. 
Todd's inspiration was a real asset to 
the team." 

Flynn was one of the hardest-
working players and was always 
looking to give that linle extra bit of 
effort that might make the differ-
ence. 

"Kevin was another guy that 
started last season, but played more 
of a backup middle role this year," 
Larsen said. "Even though he didn't 
play quite as much, he still worked 
harder than anyone. We used to 
always joke about how many shirts 
he was going to bring to practice 
because he would go through so 
many of them, working so hard. At 
6'2" he was a good offensive middle. 
He understood his role and really 

worked hard to improve; if some-
thing had to be done he would do it. 
He just had a great work ethic. 
whether it would be at practice, in 
the gym. lifting weights, anywhere." 

These four players will be diffi -
cult to replace next season, not just 
for their play on the court, but for 
their overall success. 

"These guys are great because. 
in my two years here, they've been 
superb everywhere - not just on 
the court and in practice, but in the 
classroom, too," Larsen sa id. "They 
are what I like to call 'low-mainte-
nance athletes ... Â· 

We hope these stellar perfor-
mances and success follows them 
into the real world. They have left 
their mark on Triton volleyball and 
will be leaving behind four big 
pairs of shoes to fill.

Mothers: 
You Gals 
Rock! 

Fulton 
Corner 

ROBERT FULTON 

S ince yesterday was Moth-er's Day, [ thought it 1V0uid be appropria te to 
celebrate some of the best mothers 
of athletes out there. Yes, athletes 
have mothers too, though some of 
them act like spoiled brats. So here 
are the top tive mothers of profes-
Sional athletes. 

o. 4: Terrell Davis' mom. T he 
star running back for the Denver 
Broncos would not be where he is 
today without the assistance of his 
loving mother. Kateree DaVIS. Have 
you seen those clips? Sometimes 
she is seen sprinting down the 
sideline with Terrell in an attempt 
to give him his Campbell's Chunky 
Soup. Thf dedication that Kateree 
shows IS tremendous. There she is, 
among 300-pound linebackers. 
braving certain destruction just to 
make sure her son gets proper 
nourishment. If Terrell did not get 
his Campbell's Chunky Soup, he 
would surely fail. She holds all of 
the qualities of a splendiferous 
mom. She is dedicated. loving and 
will do anything for her son. 

No.3: Forrest Gump's mom. 
You may have forgo tten, but For-
rest was a fine athlete. He was a 
football star fo r the University of 
Alabama and was nearly untouch-
able on kickoff returns. He was 
fearless, and he owed it all to his 
mother. She got him the proper 
medical attention and education. 
She also gave him such sound 
advice as "Life is like a box of 
chocolates" and "Stupid is as stu-
pid does." Sure. Jenny gave him 
support too. saying, "Run. Forrest, 
run!" but his mom was still his 
main guide. If not for his mother. 
Gump would not have reached the 
stardom that he did on the football 
field at the Ulliversiry of Alabama. 

;-..io. 2: Babe Ruth's mom. First. 
this woman gets props for giving 
birth to one of the greatest baseball 
players of all time. He hit 715 
home runs. garnered 90 victones 
as a pilcher and won many World 
Series nngs. But, much like a 
Transformer, there is more than 
meets the eye. She also contributed 
to the world of pop culture by writ-
ing the famous song "I got you 
Babe" for her son. The song was 
later popularized by Sonny and 
Cher, but it was Babe's mom who 
sang it to Babe at night to help him 
sleep. For this we are eternally 
grateful. 

o. 1 B: This goes out to all of 
those mothers who bust their asses 
taking care of their children. There 
are some who fail at the job, but 
that is not what this column is 
about. Those mothers who do 
their job well don 't get nearly as 
much attention as those who 
don 't. 

Bad mothers are criticized when 
their children screw up, and the 
good ones are praised when the 
child comes out fine. I know it's 
the mother's responsibility to take 
care of her kids, so why should she 
get extra praise for doing just what

UCSD Baseball Wraps Up 2001 Season 
Despite a less-than-stellar record, Tritons make progress In Division II 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Assoc iate Sports Editor 

The Tritons have hurled their last pitch, 
taken their last hack and shagged their last fly 
ball - at least for this season. 

UCSD baseball recently wrapped up its 
2001 season with a 13-5 loss to Sonoma State 
University. It was the culmination of a season 
that had its share of ups and downs, apexes and 
nadirs, lights of high and lights of low. 

Triton baseball fi nished with an overall 
record of 14-34, going 8-15 at home and 6-19 
on the road. Though the record may not reflect 
it , they mad progress throughout the season as 
many players continued with the quality play 
that they exhibited in prior seasons, and new 
players emerged to make their presence felt. 

The tough level of pitching in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association did not daunt 
the Triton batsmen, and many put up some 
solid numbers over the duration of this year's 
campaign. 

Ryan Larson led the offensive charge, bat-
ting a whopping .410 this season. Compiling 
73 hits, including 13 doubles, five homeruns 
and a team-leading 45 runs batted in, Larson 
certainly got it done at the plate. 

Chad Addison was no slouch in the batter's 
box either, batting .352 in 196 at-bats while 
starting every game. 

Tyler Sullivan was also strong offensively, 
notching a .328 average and knockin~ in 21 runs. 

Overall. the rest of the squad did relatively 
_~ell at the plate with only a couple of players 
falling below the dreaded Mendoza line. Sullivan 
was the man on the base paths for UCSD, lead-
ing the team in steals, with 11 out of 16 tries. 

The nitons had a more difficult time out on 
the hill, because opposin$ batters often feasted 
on UCSD's pitched offenngs. . 

Ace hurler John Beaven ended the season 

lyon UfHI / Guard/Btl 
T ........ HIck: A TritQn batsman taltts a mighty cut in CaJifomia CoIJegiate Athletic Action earlier this season. 
with a respectable (in this very offensive divi-
sion) earned run average of 4.91 and an overall 
record of 4-8. He led the team with 53 strike-
outs and 88 innings pitched. He also ranked 
the most number of wins. 

Andr Hanau was the second-most often 
used niton arm, going 57 7J3 innings with a 2-

9 record and a 5.93 earned run li,\''!rage. 
His 37 K's were also up among the team 

leaders, falling behind Beaven and Alexander 
Cremidan, who had 41 whiffballs. Tommy 
Sereno saw action in the most games for the 
Thtons, taking the mound in 18 of the team's 
tilts.
