Candidates tackle city issues 
Frye, Sanders hold first debate at UCSD 

Jason Campe/Ciuordion 
Face-off: Mayoral candidates Donna Frye (left) and Jeny Sanders (right) jousted over issues in a Sept 30 debate at UCSD. 

By JESSICA HORION 
Contributing Writer 

San Diego City Councilwoman 
Donna Frye and former Police 
Chief Jerry Sanders sparred over 
issues of fiscal management and 
open and accessible government 
in their first official debate in the 
run-up to the November mayoral 
election. 

Questions at the Sept. 30 
event, hosted by UCSD on Sept. 
30, were posed by a six-person 
panel, which included Graduate 
Student Association President 

Laura Kwinn, Associated Students 
President Christopher Sweeten, 
assistant political science profes-
sor Thad Kousser and representa-
tives from the event's co-sponsors, 
California Common Cause and 
the League of Women Voters. 
The event was moderated by the 
new dean of arts and sciences, 
Michael Bernstein. 

An audience of about 420 peo-
ple filled Price Center Theatre 
with boos, hisses and cheers as 
the candidates presented radically 
different plans for how best to 
deliver the city from political and 

financial woes, including a pension 
deficit of more than $1.37 bil-
lion, numerous underfunded city 
projects and a legacy of corruption 
and mismanagement among city 
official ranks. 

Frye emphasized a leader-
ship style in which "one person 
is accountable to you, the voters," 
by eliminating the current posi-
tion of city manager and vesting 
all responsibility in the office of 
the mayor. She envisioned a new 
cabinet filled with the nation 's

Regents delay vote on private funding 
Board approves 10-year plan to improve salary levels 

By KATE McELHINNEY 
Staff Writer 

A committee of Urnversity of 
California regents met last month 
and decided to delay discussion on 
a proposal to use private funding 
for salaries. 

The regents approved a portion 
of the proposal, which included 
plans to raise all UC employee sala-
ries to competitive market levels 
within the next 10 years. 

In November, the regents will 
consider using private donations 
to supplement the salaries of UC 
administrators who have been 
receiving below-market pay, which 
the university attributes to eco-
nomic downulffi and four years of 
less-than-sufficient state funding. 

"We are facing a massive chal-
lenge to maintain quality and pay 
competitive salaries throughout the 
university, from service employees 
to faculty to senior leadership," 
Regent Judith Hopkinson stated 

on the university's Web site. "We 
need to find all available sources 
of funding to bring salaries up to 
market." 

Using donated funds is rela-
tively common among other uni-
versities, and might prove vital in 
helping to boost pay and entice top 
administrators to the UC system, 
according to Noel Van Nyhws, 
UC Office of the President spokes-
man. 

"The main initiative is to ensure 
that all staff and faculty receive 
market-rate compensation in the 
next 10 years," Van Nyhuis said. 
"[But1 we don't know where it's 
going to go yet." 

According to research by 
the Mercer Human Resource 
Consulting, the university is above 
the market median for health and 
retirement benefits. The research 
also shows that the university is 15 
percent behind comparable market 
salaries. 

By using private funds, the 

regents hope to bring 42 top 
administrative positions up to 
market rates in the next 10 years. 
The money would be used to aug-
ment pay of positions with pay that 
exceeds $350,000, according to the 
proposal. They would include the 
UC chancellors, deans and presi-
dent. 

By using donated funds, Van 
Nyhws said, the university could 
recruit top candidates, while pre-
cious state funds could be used 
to compensate other university 
employees. 

However, the regents' propos-
al has met opposition from some 
teachers and students, particularly 
from UC Davis Academic Senate 
Chair Darnel Simmons, who said 
that the regents have more impor-
tant topics to foeti on. 

"It's an outrageous p.roposi-
tion," said immons, who also is a 
professor at the UC Davis School

Legislation grants CSU 
first doctorate program 
Bill deviates from California's 

45-year-old Master Plan 
By CHARLES NGUYEN 

News Editor 

In unprecedented legislation, 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ha 
signed legislation that would grant 
the California State University 
system the right to issue educa-
tional doctorates. 

The bill, SB 724, i the first 
to give the university the right 
to grant a doctorate, and marks a 
departure from California's Master 
Plan for Higher Education, draft-
ed in 1960. 

The Master Plan had origi -
nally awarded individual doctoral 
programs solely to Univer iry of 
California, while the California 
State University were to partici -
pate only in joint programs with 
UC campuses. 

While the Master Plan has 
been a time-honored document, it 
has outlived its usefulness, accord-
ing to San Diego State University 
Dean of Graduate Studies Jan 
Andersen. 

"The Master Plan has served 
California well, but times change 
and needs change," Anderse n 
said. "We believe that the Master 
Plan has served its purpose, 
and its rigidity does not make 
sense. " 

Because of the document, the 
California State University has 
not been able to accommodate 

the needs of students seeking 
schooling in educa tio n, a realm 
largely ignored by the nivcrsity 
of Ca lifornia, Andersen sa id . 

" In California, 010 t of ed uca-
tional doctorates take place in pri-
vate colleges," she sa id . " It 's been 
difficult across the state to find 
partners in Uc. CS has a great 
deal more history and background 
in education and educational pro-
grams." 

San Diego State and Cal State 
San Marcos currently has a joint 
educa tion al doctorate program 
with UCSD, which admitted its 
first class in January 2005. 

While UCSD's partnership 
with San Diego State is one of the 
most productive in the state , the 
legislation is designed to target 
other subpar programs, according 
to Wendy Gordon, spokeswoman 
for bill auth or state Sen. Jack 
Scott (D-Pasadena). 

"A few UC school s have joint 
doctorate programs," Gordon 
sa id . "But those programs are few 
and far between and don't handle 
very many people. I f you need a 
doctorate in ed ucation to be an 
ad ministrator in high school or 
communiry coll ege, it is hard to 
get them at a Ca lifornia public 
school. Those wh 0 want them 
would have to go out of state

RIAA continues 

file-sharing lawsuits 
The Recording Industry 

Association of America announced 
another round of lawsuits against 
students at 17 different colleges 
for copyright infringement. 

As was the case earlier this year, 
the RIAA is targeting network users 
of the i2hub application on the 
Internet2 network infrastructure. 
In addition, the association cited 
illegal student use of copyrighted 
music in distribution through the 
Internet using peer-to-peer ser-
vices such as eDonkey, Grokster, 
Kazaa and LimeWi re, according to 
an RIAA press release. 

So far, the RIAA has filed 560 
lawsuits at 39 campuses this year. 
Eight UCSD students are inclu~ed 
in the latest. series of RIAA litiga-
tions. 

College students' 
detit growing 

The number of students that 
rely on student loans is growing. 
up about 40 percent from the 
1970s, according to a study by the 
Center for Economic and Policy 
Research . 

Since 1990, expenses for public 
four-year colleges have increased 
almost 60 percent, a figure CEPR 
attaches to rising university costs 
and public policy due to increased 
loan opportunities but not grant 
aid for students. 

"American students are graduat-
ing with more debt than ever: the 
study's author Heather Boushey 
stated in a press release. "We are 
handing college graduates a bill 
for more than $17,000 when they 
receive their diploma. Working 
your way through college is no 
longer possible with such a low 
minimum wage and few grants 
available to students." 

Study re~rts same-
sex couple trends 
Data from the 2000 U.S. Census 

revealed trends about homosexual 
couples, compiled in a study done 
by the Williams Project, a think 
tank from the UCLA School of Law. 
Titled "Same-sex Couples and 
Same-sex Couples Raising Children 
in the United States: Data from 
Census 2000: the study found 
that, among other things, mem-
bers of same-sex couples are 
more likely than those in married 
couples to be employed and have 
college degrees. The study also 
estimated that same-sex couples 
in the United States are raising 
approximately 250,000 children, 
with 60 percent of those families 
made up of two female parents. 

In addition, homosexual cou-
ples that raise children are more 
likely to be an ethnic minority, 
which "may mean that these 
parents are more likely to face 
discrimination in employment or 
the housing and rental markets,· 
according to the study.

CEPR reports that almost two-
thi rds of college students attend-
ing four-year public colleges take 
out loans, with an average debt 
of $17,600 for graduating seniors. 
The study also found a higher 
rate of debt among students from 
lower-income families. Students 
of families in the lowest income 
quartile who graduated in 2003-
04 were found to have an aver-
age of $16,438 in loans, while 
students from families in the 
highest quartile had an average 
of $15,253. (EPR compared the 
numbers to 1989-90, and found 
a 116-percent increase for lower-
quartile students and 28-percent 
increase for higher-quartile stu-
dents, adjusted for inflation. The 
study also reported that students 
from low-income families who 
attend public schools are one-
third more likely to take on debt 
than students from high-income 
families. 

Same-sex households with chil-
dren generally have fewer eco-
nomic resources, the study stated. 
The study reported that same-sex 
parents have lower levels of edu-
cation than heterosexual parents, 
resulting in a lower household 
income. The average household 
income for same-sex couples with 
a child is $11,000 lower than the 
median household income for het-
erosexual couples with children.

THE UCSD G\.JAIlDIAN 

Pay:UCSA 
. president 

opposes salary 
raises for execs 

continwed from page I 
of Law. "There are higher priori-
ties than higher executive salaries . . 
Raising money for graduate students 
[should be) much higher on the 
agenda than extreme funding for 
executives. " 

In the UC pay system, employees 
will continue to compete for higher 
salaries, according to Simmons. 

"Mainly, I can't feel sony for 
someone earning 5350,000," 
Simmons said. 

UC Student Association President 
and Berkeley graduate smdent Anu 
Joshi also disagreed with the private 
donations plan. 

"My reaction to this is that 
the UC is a public university and 
serves the f.unilies and people of 
Califorrua," Joshi said. "The people 
who work there are public employees 
and [should) be held accountable to 
w payers and California &miIies." 

Joshi disagreed with the propos-
al's focus, and said that emphasis 
should be given to the financial sim-
ation of srudents. 

"Students have &ced fee increas-
es for the last four years," Joshi 
said. "We should concentrate less on 
executive salaries and focus more on 
the affordability of student fees and 
financial aid." 

Because UC President Roben 
C. Dynes had been approached by 
private companies with finances to 
fund solely aecutive pay, the pro-
posal could only be beneficial for the 
university, he told the San Frfl7lCisco 
Clmmick.

SOUJld lilee the wet dream of a lone-
ly physic major? Well, yes, but it's 
also ' the gist of a report issued by 
the Undergraduate Student Experience 
and Satisfaction Committee, avai lab le 
online at bttp:llstudentresearcb.1tcsd.edul 
.rntisfrlCtion. Apparently C D's admin-
istration, at some point, had an epiph-
any that not all is well in the life of 
UCS D undergraduates, and a commit-
tee spent much of last year poring over 
; tudent surveys, interviewing groups 
of students, fa culty and othcr main 
players on the CSD stage, as well 
as 3nalrzing UCS D's physical spaces. 
The committee, appointed in January 
2005 by fonner Acting Senior Vice 
Chancellor of Academic Affairs David 
R. Miller and Vice Chancellors Joseph 
W. Watson (student affairs) and James 
M. Langley (external relations) , was 
composed of one graduate student, one 
undergrad from each of the six colleges, 
the Sixth College provost, the associate 
vice chancellor of undergraduate ed uca-
tion, one faculty member, two staff and 
two alumni . 

Their just-rel eased report - all 59 
pages, not counting the appendices - is 
cathartic to read and rather damning, 
because students don't seem to be happy 
about nnytbi71g at UCS D. Fifty percent 
of the document is a juicy laundry list 
of what's wrong with CS D, and the 
other 50 percent i a pile of equa lly juicy 
recommendations based on the commit-

tcc'~ findings. These recommendations 
arc hroken up into three categories: 
"Important: major impact but needs 
further development," "si mple, stra ight-
forw:lrd ," and "Important: significant or 
major impact and immediately feasib le." 
Or, in other words: "Too expensive 
to implement right now," "Cheap and 
easy," and "Sure to be instantly rejected 
by Vice Chancellor Watson." 

The committee's recommendations 
arc brave, ambitious, well-intentioned 
and spot-on , but onl y ·some are rea lis-

tic, at least at this point in time. Take 
the committee's ca ll for housing for 
all transfer students, a guarantee of 
four-year on-campus housing for all 
students who wish it, and the "improve-
ment of the design of residential buil d-
ings." Of course it should happen; but 
is it possi ble given the present reality 
of second-year students not necessar-
ily being offered on-campus housing? 
The cost and logistic of such a plan are 
intimidating, especially in the midst of 
Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox's complaints about 
UCSD reaching its debt 
capacity. 

" 

City; expanding the San Diego Trolley 
to UCSD and (a no-brainer) build-
ing additional parkjng structures. Of 
course, if the call to build enough 
on-campus residences to accommo-
date students for four years i heeded , 
much of the demand for parking spaces 
wou ld be diminished, especially if the 
areas around UCSD were served by 
UCSD shuttles. In add ition, much of 
the parking woes on campus would be 
immediately alleviated if weekends at 

UCSD were made more 

No aspect of UCSD 
student life seems to have 
escaped the comminee. 
When it comes to sports , 
the committee conclud-
ed that an eventua l move 
to Division I athletics 
is a must, although it 
acknowledged that such 
a move could have an 
immediate dampening 
effect on school spirit 
because sports teams sud-
den ly become less com-
petitive upon a move to 
Divis ion I. And in one of 
the more surreal recom-
mendations, the commit-
tee ca lled for the creation 

And in one of tl1e 
more surreal 

attractive; based on sttl-
dent comments that are 
included and summa-
rized in the report, it's

For example, a recurring theme in

numbers of students, nosey RSOs and 
oppressive punishments. T he commit-
tee suggests allowing rooms at Price 
Center to be used on weekends for per-

so~a l gatherings with no noise restric-
tions, the extending of Price Center 
and shuttle hours to make the campus 
an attractive evening dest)nation, the 
serving of alcohol to those over 21 at 
more campus events and the .return of 
"Thank God It's Friday" concerts at 
the Hump behind the Student Center, 
which had alcohol for those of drink-
ing age and were an extremely popular 
weekly tradition before they were fool-
ishly discontinued. 

All of these measures are means to an 
end: greater campus cohesion, the cre-
ation of campus traditions and a more 
social campus culture, and the transfor-
mation of UCSD into a lively hang-out 
spot on evenings and weekends. 

Few UCSD administrators would 
deny the worth of these goals, but 
might waver in .approving the steps 
needed to make them happen : namely, 
the easing of campus alcohol policies 
and abolishing the "lega listic," "restric-
tive" cul ture of UCSD (which would 
necessitate a major attitude adjutstment 
of most or all of UCSD's RSOs). 

The committee was extremcly per-
ceptive when listening to students and 
gracefully accomplished the difficult 
task of translating the litany of com-
plaints into a concrete set of actions. 
Now the ball is in administrators' court, 
and all we can ask is that they give the 
recommendations a try. Writing off 
any of the recommendations as too 
risky, ambitious, expensive or logisti-
cally difficult will be tempting, but is 
exactly the wrong reaction. Many of 
the recommendations are drastic, but 
that's exactly the point: UCS D is not 
at the proper level, and much needs to 
be done.

Fifth .. year students go against the • graIn Write. 
Illustrate. Great 

Expectations 
Carol Freire 

Fifth-year seniors are pre-pared for anything. We know which professors 
are bluffing about pop quizzes 
and which ones mean business, 
and we know that it's going to 
rain for two weeks straight in 
the middle of the school year. 
We can walk through campus 
blindfolded and point out which 
buildings have been erected over-
night. Perhaps the only thing we 
are good for is telling you that 
Ledden Auditorium is what used 
to be HSS 2250 (renamed after 
the late Muir Provost Patrick 
) . Ledden) . We remember plan-
ning our freshman fall quarter 
schedu les with paper and pencils, 
and standing in line to get little 
square stickers that proved you 
had paid your dues to the C 
regents. We remember the time 
when US" spot were not endan-
gered and plentifully covered the 
land. We have learned to plan 
ahead for parking, and we have 
our umbrellas. Bring it on. 

The only thing we're not pre-
pared for is the barrage of acquajn-
rances trying ro coax us out of the 
university. Those insidious jabs 
can sneale into any conversa tion . It 
usually goes omething lilee, "Hey 
... ? Uh, aren 't you suppo ed to be 
gone by now ?" Sometime they're 
loaded with thinly veiled indigna-
tion, as in, "What happened? I 
thought you were done. " 

We're lepers, we mow. Stop 
throwing it at us. Before you 
shoot another one of those verbal 
gems, pretend we' re disfigured . 

Now gauge the appropriateness of 
such comments. 

"Super-seniors" have commh-
ted the grievous sin of violat-
ing your expectations. We came 
here under the clear and unstated 
assumption that we would leave 
in four years, and yet here we 
are, freeloading off the state and 
fi lling up your classes. Some 
of tis have good reasons, some 
don't. There are engineers who 
stubbornly insist on graduating 
from ERe. T here are the biol-
ogy majors who have waited until 
their senior year to take that 
one lab, and got screwed over 
when those previously spacious 
and student-free labs became 
overcrowded wirh sophomores 
and their newfangled mandatory 
requirements. There are super-
seniors who jumped on the mul-
tiple-major bandwagon, or those 
that were too scared to venture 
forth into the real world. 

To be brutally honest, every 
supersenior is a little scared of 
going into the real world. The 
sad part about taking a fifth year 
is putting off the real world and 
avoiding inevitable change. For 
fifth years, as my friend TJ likes 
to rease, it is like " the move-
on train is leaving and you're 
not on it." The vasr majority of 
your arne-age peers move away, 
if they haven't already. Even with 
those who tick around to work, if 
your friendship didn 't evolve past 
the UCSD-based activities you 
shared, it can get awkward. You 
can only do the "remember that 
time we ... " so many times. 

College is supposed to be the 
transition to adulthood, and that 
is frightening. Financial indepen-
dence is tricky. There are all these 
things you can do with your life, 
and all these things you can do 
to mess it up. It's harder to makc 

friends out of college, but it starts 
to ger harder to make friends in 
college. 

You would thinle there isn't 
much difference between fifth 
years and freshmen, but perhaps 
it's a testament to the effective-
ness of a college education that 
.there is. There is a lot of matura-
tion that happens in those four or 
five years, and the gap in inter-
ests become increasingly glaring. 
Drunleen frat parties just lose 
their appeal. Fighting change is a 
Sisyphean task. 

Nonetheless, there is hope 
that you can attenuate change by 
increasing the time over which it 
happens. Thjs discovery is noth-
ing novel. According to the UCSD 
Student Research and Information 
Web site, the amount of time 
it talees the average student to 
graduate 0 ciliated between 4.4 
and 4.5 years from 1999 to 2004. 
The data for the 2005 graduation 
isn't complete, of course, becau,e 
of slackers like me, who are fifth -
years. We're taking our sweet time 
to graduate; get used to it. 

The fact that students on aver-
age talee more than four years to 
graduate is likely correlated with 
the national trend of tudents com-
pleting double majors. The Nt'W 
York Timts'Tamar Lewin noted in 
2002 that an increasing number of 
students were opting for double, 
triple and even quadruple majors. 
Lewin cited students' desires to 
have an edge on the faltering 
economy and combat dim job 
prospects as possible e1(planations 
for the trend. Considering ever-
increasing tuition costs, reduc-
tions in support services such 
as O.A.S.I.S., and the increas-
ing probability of double or even 
triple majors, fifth years are not a 
surprising phenomenon. 

'It's hard to keep up a great 

GPA with all the extracurricu lar 
activities required for professional 
school, especially if you're also 
working. Students are encour-
aged to pur ue their dreams, but 
not everyone gets to be president 
when they grow up. If you're try-
ing to appease the Bank of Mom 
and Dad, a double major may be 
a good compromise: I think of it 
as your dreams plus a safety net. 
Unfortunately, if you're trying to 
do a biology and theater major 
at Revelle, that could conceivab ly 
rake more than fou r years. 

As a demographic, college 
students didn't land in college 
because they did the bare mini -
mum. They made it because 
they kept up good grades in the 
right classe whi le doing sports, 
student council and community 
service. We could have skipped 
out on the college preparatory 
classes, but we figured out that 
it'd be best to sq ueeze in as many 
AP and honors classes as possible. 
Working retai l all our lives just 
didn't seem so appealing. Is it so 
wild to speculate that we'd keep 
up in. college? 

Whether .or not multiple 
majors are actually more market-
able remains to be seen. Perhaps 
remaining in. ERC as an engineer 
wasn 't the brightest idea of our 
college career. Maybe we should 
have. switched majors when we 
failed chemistry the first time. But 
regardless, we're still here. We're 
going to keep experimenting with 
ways to deal with environmental 
stresso rs. Meanwhile, please, top 
trying to kicle us out. We're not 
leaving. And we might be super-
vising you very, very soon.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NE'WS 7 

. Doctorate: UCSD to continue education doctorate partnership with CSU 
continued from page I 

or go to a private school, which 
costs a lot of money - and CSU 
is the perfect place for students to 
furrhur their career aspirations in 
education. " 

Because of budget constraints, 
UC campuses have been reluc-
tant to expand their joint doctoral 
programs, Gordon said . 

There are currendy 22 joint 
doctoral programs berween the 
UC and CSU campuses, and seven 
of those are in educational lead-
ership, according to UC Office 
of the President spokesman Brad 
Hayward. 

Difficulties in establishing 
partnerships between the rwo uni-
versity systems stem from nuanc-
es, according to UCSD Director 
of Education Studies Randall J. 
Souviney. 

"Both CSU and UC want part-

new program that tries to work 
across rwo systems, there are a lot 
of logistical difficulties ," he said. 
"But it's especially hard for CSU 

campuses that aren't even near a 
UC school." 

Originally, the bill would 
have allowed CSU campuses 
to run audiology and physical 
therapy doctorate programs, an 
effort opposed by the University 
of California because the idea 
clashed with the Master Plan, 
according to Hayward. 

"Our concern was that the 
state continue to comply with the 
Master Plan, which has proved 
very effective in making high-
quality education available to stu-
dents at a cost that is affordable to 
the state, rather than encouraging 
cosdy duplication of programs 
across the segments of higher 
education," Hayward stated in an 
e-mail. "In the case of the [educa-
tion degreesl , we concluded that 
CSU intended to offer a very 
specific kind of degree, and one 
that was distinct from the kind 
of education doctoral degree that 
Dc offers and will continue to 
offer." 

San Diego State plans to 

continue its partnership with 
UCSD for educational doctor-
ates, although the school plans 
to diverge to create its own indi-

that seem to require

vidual program, Andersen said. 
"There are some areas in e du-

cational leadership we've thought 
of developing that UCSD would 
not be interested in," she sa id . 

"We're particularly interested in 
community college leadership, 
which is not a primary focus for 
UCSD." 

Andersen projects the estab-
lishment of an independent 
San Diego State program, with 
emphasis in community college 
administration, for fall 2007. 

If San Diego State did decide 
to establish its own program in 
education, UCSD would not devi-
ate from its current partnership, 
according to UCSD Director 
of Graduate Studies Richard 
Attiyeh. There are currendy eight 
joint doctoral programs between 
UCSD and San Diego State . 

Andersen said she hopes that 
the latest legislation is a move 
toward even more doctoral pro-
grams being offered solely by 
the California State University, 
if needs arise, despite the Master 
Plan restrictions. 

"In order for us to do any-
thing, it takes legislative change," 
she said . "We hope to investigate 
and reassess the Master Plan to 

address the needs of the Sla te. If 
there are fields or areas that seem 
to require developmenr, we will 
seek legislative change to allow 
us to establish a doctoral program 
to accommodate that . We don 't 
believe in arbitrary bounds set in 
I 960s." 

The introduction of the legis-
lation, however, was not meant to 
change the state objectives estab-
lished by the Master Plan , accord-
ing to Gordon . 

"The CSU system, which has 
many more campuses that would 
be able to offer an educational 
doctorate, needed this bill," she 
said. " IScott] does not believe 
this bill would damage the Master 
Plan in any way, hape or form . 
In this day and age, when public 
school education is under such 
public scrutiny, it is importanr 
that we establish a way for leaders 
to come into administration in 
any way."

Debate: Frye, Sanders suggest changes to San Diego real estate market

brightest figures, who would rcflect 
the diversity of the San Diego com-
munity. 

Her plan also called for the 
mayor to stop presiding over city 
councH meetings. 

"[This] will give me more 
opportunities to go out into the 
community ... to hold meetings in 
the evening when it's convenient 
for the public and nor convenient 
just for the elected officials," Frye 
said. 

Sanders, on the other hand, 
argued for creating a "CEO of the 
city." His plan rests on appointing 
retired Navy Rear Adm. Ronnie 
Froman as city manager, who would 
be responsible for running the day-
to-day business of the city while the 
mayor engaged in public forums 
and meetings. 

Sanders also said that the mayor 
would be proactive in lobbying heav-
ily in Sacramento and Washington 
for "our share of infrastructure dol-
lars," which he feels San Diego is 
currently not receiving . 

To help bring the city's finances 
back into balance, Frye said that 
she would immediately stop the 
payment of "illeg:i1" pensions upon 
assuming office, referring to the 
retirement benefits promised to city 
employees that are currendy the 
subject of legal investigation. She 
also emphasized that the city faces 
deficits far beyond the over-prom-
ised pensions and suggested forcing 
redevelopment agencies to pay back 
the money that they owe the city. 

Sanders attacked her plan, argu-
ing that "you can't just stop pay-
ments without a judge making that 
decision." Instead he touted a plan 

to "trim down" the city by call-
ing on 300 top city managers to 
step down and freezing the salaries 
of city employees until the sy tern 
stabili7..es. 

"We need new blood, we need 
new ideas, we need new expertise, 
and that's going to require bring-
ing new people into the positions," 
Sanders said. 

Whenever possible, the candi-
dates referred to their past achieve-
ments as evidence of their leadership 
abilities. Sanders spoke frequently 
about his successes as a leader in 
the San Diego Police Department 
and a board chairman of the local 
chapter of the Red Cross, while 
Frye pointed to more than 20 years 
experience as a community advo-
cate and a stint of honest, outspo-
ken leadership effecting change on 
the city council since 2001.

The candidates were also asked 
to address an issue close to many 
students: the lack of affordable 
housing in San Diego. 

Frye discussed a need to raise 
the costs for developers who waive 
their obligations to build affordable 
housing and ensure that renters are 
compensated and relocated when 
they are displaced by condominium 
conversions . 

Sanders emphasized providing 
new incentives for the building of 
affordable apartments, along with 
streamlining the building process 
and exploring the city's "extensive" 
property holdings. Not all students 
felt that the topics covered were 
relevant to UCSD students, de pite 
opportunities for the audience to 
ask questions on a range of diverse 
subjects. 

"I would have liked the candi-

dates to expand on what their actual 
plans are ror helping education ," 
Eleanor Roosevelt College cnior 
Karoline Katus said. 

Others disagreed , explaining 
that resolving the city's financial 
and management problems were 
rightly the top priority. 

"As long as management of the 
city gets dealt with, that's what' 
important," Earl Warren College 
sophomore AJex Miller said. 

The university hosted the event 
"as a maner of civic responsibil-
ity, bringing the issues to campus

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK 
MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9 ----------------------~~~~----------------------------------------

I t is a continent where 25 million adults and children are battling A.l.D.S. Civil wars rage among 
citizens who are constantly at the 
mercy of political strife. Millions live 
in abject poveny with little expecta-
tion of improvement. In Africa, the 
filcts are grim and it is easy to ask the 
question that hovers in the minds of 
many: How does one begin to help? 

Africa Aid, a new nonprofit orga-
nization based in San Diego, claims 
it has the answer. Founded by UCSD 
graduate and Executive Director 
Eric Woods, the organization heeds 
the call of Afiica's underprivileged 
communities and does it with a plan 
that is unique to the hundreds of 
relief groups aiding Africa. 

Woods was inspired to create 
Africa Aid by current international 
economic theories, "The Elld of 
Poverty," by Jeffrey Sachs, a former 
personal advisor to United Nations 
Secretary-General K06 Annan, and 
a trip to Ghana - an experience that 
allowed Woods to see the problelns 
in Africa more clearly than ever. 

After considering the astounding 
task of easing Africa's poveny with 
a manageable and efficient system, 
Africa AId concludes that the most 
practical way to do so is to separate 
itself from political and money-driv-
en establishments in order to aUow a 
different force to help Africa, a force 
that holds not only the desire but 
also the power to help: the people. 

Its plan rests on students and the 
academic resources of universities 
as the main hub of the program. So 
far, Africa Aid has coUahorated with 
San Diego Stlte University and the 
University of San Diego in creat-
ing education programs and relief 
projects with close ties to key com-
munities in Africa. Localizing relief 
efforts is what Africa Aid believes 
will be the key that opens the door 
for hunger relief, water sanitation 

initiatives and a solid method of 
education. 

"We wanted to find a way to 
tackle all these problems at once," 
Woods said. "In my eyes, the only 
way to do that is invest in aU areas 
of the community. You have all these 
minds that are worlcing together and 
you have students who are passion-
ate and want to get involved. This is 
the nucleus of our program." 

UCSD graduate student Jon 
Shafran, a sociology major, believes 
that it is this power within the stu-
dents and the resources that a uni-
versity setting provides that moti-
vates Africa Aid in its plan of action. 

"When you're in college, there 
is so much exposure," Shafran said. 
"Srudents are histOrically involved in 
civil activism and it's one of the best 
ways to get involved." 

But more than using the ener-
gy of universities to feed the task 
of aid, it is the responsibility of 
maintaining the flow of relief from 
the United States, localized or 
not. Executive Vice President and 
Thurgood Marshall College Senior 
Chris Taylor is adamant in not only 
providing aid, but providing a trust-
wonhy relationship with communi-
ties in a cultur:illy conscious manner 
that will allow for positive change. 

"We want to focus on sustain-
ability and in order to do that, you 
have to work with the locals -
Africans - and help them design 
their programs because they know 
their needs more than anyone else," 
Taylor said. 

Africa Aid is also keen on allow-
ing students to use their education to 
an advantlge by stepping outside the 
limits of the university and applying 
their skills, for example, on engi-
neering projects, international eco-
nomics, teaching and health care.

Africa Aid is currently worlc.ing 
with the community of Buduburam, 
a Liberian refugee settlement in 
Ghana that holds about 52,000 resi-
dents, according to Africa Aid. Upon 
the official end of the Liberian civil 
war, the result was a settlement with 
no safe drinking water, an unsteady 
education system and a severe short-
age of doctors and teachers. 

"It's getting this stuff out in class-
rooms and letting students design 
programs specifically for places 
where you [not only] have aid that's 
. .. tailored, but allows students to 
use their knowledge and applying it 
to the real world," Taylor said. "The 
problems in Afiica arc reasonable 
when they're scaled down." 

Members will travel to 
Buduburam in twO weeks to assess 
the problems in the settlement. They 
will take water samples to develop a 
substantial water sanitation system 
for its residents.

the difficulty of achieving slow and 
steady improvement in Buduburam. 
But after the initial &Cnzy of intro-
ducing their idea to professors and 
universities, Woods and Taylor 
gained their ultimate goal: develop-
ing an cstlblished rnodeI for other 
organizations to adopt and consider. 

Africa Aid partners i~lf with 
other organizations such as the One 
campaign, a promotional site that 
actively works with celebrity names 
to further capture the attention of 
an audience that is interested in the 
cause to end poverty, but uncertain 
of where to begin. And events such 
as the Live 8 worldwide concert 
and films like "Invisible Children," a 
documentlry detailing the Sudanese 
civil war's effect on neighboring 
Uganda and its children, have show-
cased the relief possibilities to a 
younger generation. 

"We've had sueh a strong 
response because we have grassroots, 
community level programs," Woods 
said. "rfbej One [campaignj rallies 
millions, and we're the bridge that 

takes it over to Africa with pro-
grams." 

Africa Aid is a pending student 
organization at UCSD but, as a new 
nonprofit organization, is slowly 
gaining recognition through word of 
mouth, its Web site and promotional 
events here in San Diego. Eventua ll y, 
Africa Aid aims to expand to other 
Southern California communities in 
Los Angeles and Orange County. 
Here in San Diego, the foundation 
has been built and its model is ready 
for other organi7..ations to follow. 

Currently, Afiica Aid is collabo-
rating witll Bridge for Africa, a La 
)oUa based nonprofit orga nization, 
to design a plan for building relation-
ship between Liberian and Ghallian 
CTlIftsman so that their trades can be 
brought to the United States. 

"We have conunilted people who 
believe in the goal and who believe 
in helping Africa and when you have 
that, YOli have an undying effon," 
Woods said.

Lawsuit claims UC admissions biased against Christian schools 
By MARHETTI FEDERIS 

As50Ciate Focus Editor 

T hey can be seen gathered at the lounges in front of the Price Center ballrooms, ta lk-
ing intently, Bibles opened on their 
laps, or at Library Walk encouraging 
passersby to sign up and join their 
groups. It seems like you can fi nd 
them everywhere. The presence of 
religious organizations on campus 
is undeniable. But the relationship 
between universities and religion is 
growing increasingly contentious. 

T his con fl ic t has sur faced 
between the University of California 
and the Association of C hristian 
Schools lnternational. T he ACSI, 
along with six students from the 
Calvary Chapel School in M urrieta, 
Calif., filed a lawsuit alleging that 
UC admissions policy discriminates 
aga LnSt studen ts from high schools 
that teach ~raditional C h ristian 
viewpoints by not accepting c1asse 
offered by the schools. 

The 'University of California 
detennincd that certain courses from 
Ca lvary Chapel School did not meet 
the system's college preparatory "3-
g" requirements, which were meant 
to ensure that students applying will 
be prepared for UC-Ievd courses. 

"Whatwcaretryingto doi make 
sure that the UC is following consti-
tutional rcquiremcntls] by looking 
at preparedness of students when 
evaluating courses," sa id Jonathan 
McCants, one of the attorneys rep-
resenting the plaintiffs. "The UC 
should not look at which perspective 
a course agrees with but how well 
they prepare a student." 

By rejecting the courses, the 
plaintiffs argue that the University 
of California is discri minating 
against a single religious perspec-
tive. The ACS I represents SOO reli-
gious schools in Califomia and 4,000 
chools nationally. 

"The most important part of 
the lawsuit is that the UC is sin-
gling our one viewpoint and thatli 
the C hristian viewpoint," McCants 
said. "Other viewpoints have gotten 
approved, but one perspective was 
singled out to be noneligible.» 

According to a statement released 
by the UC Office of the President, 
the rejected courses included pri-
mary texts that did not meet the UC 
guidelines. T he Board of Admissions 
and Relations wi th Schools, a com-
mittee within the UC Faculty 
Senate, establishes the policies in the 
admissions process, including course 
requirements for eligibility. 

"The question the University 
must confront in reviewing these 
texts is nor whether they have reli-
gious coment, but whether they pro-
vide a comprehensive view of the 
relevant subject matter, retlecting 
knowledge generally accepted in the 
scientific and educational communi-
ties and with which a srudent at the 
university level should be conver-
sant," a UCOP press release stated. 

The lawsuit alleges that 
B.O . . R.S. implemented a policy 
that would not accept certain biol-
ogy and physics textbooks because of 
the way the texts approached topics 
such as cvolution and creationism. 

UCOP maintain - that the books 
in question were rcjected not because 
of the religious content but because 
the texts did not meet the university's 
standa rds for effectively teaching the 
subject matter. 

"In the books in question, the 
publishers themselves acknowledge 
that the primary goal is to teach reli-
gious doctrine rather than the schol-
arship that is generally accepted in 
the relevant fie ld,» according to the 
UCOP statement. 

Smdents who do not meet the 
requirements do have other options, 
including taking a class at a com-
munity college, taking standardized 

tests or becoming eligible for admis-
sion by exception. 

According to UCO p, 43 courses 
covering all disciplines, including 
science classes at Calvary Chapel, 
have been approved in the past for 
the a-g requirements. 

However, McCants said that the 
university's recent dismissal of cer-
tain courses limits schools to offer 
certain classes that students might be 
interested in. 

"Students would h2ve to forgo 
opportunities to take courses that 
they would like to take," McCants 
said. "Schools won't have the ability 
to teach courses they want to teach 
and that includes the perspective 
they want to teach." 

The recent conflict between the 
UniversityofCalifornia and the ACSI 
once again raises questions about the 
role of religion in schools. Notre 
Dame U niversity history professor 
George Marsden says that the issue 
is a complicated one - but it wasn't 
always that way. Marsden's book, 
"The Soul of American University: 
From Protestant Establi hment to 
Established Nonbelief," tracks how 
the relationship between universi-
ties and religion has soured over the 
years. 

Historically, most universities 
were founded based on the beliefs of 
traditional Christian views. Marsden 
said that in the 19th century, most 
universities had clergy as professors, 
including state schools. 

"UC Berkeley was a Presbyterian 
school," Marsden said. "It was late.r 
given to the state but it retained the 
same faculty and even the same reli-
gious observances." 

According to Marsden, the 
changes are due to a shift toward a 
more pluralistic society. 

"This trend forces universi-
ties toward the secular direction," 
Marsden said. "But the university is 
a good place where all sorts of issues 

and philosophies can be discussed." 
The lawsuit also touches upon 

the influence of religion in sci-
entific thought. It claims that the 
university is more concerned about 
the fact that the courses presented 
Darwinian evolution and then "gave 
scientific reasons why Darwinian 
evolution may be false" and why 
Biblical teaching is more accurate. 

When it comes to such a debate, 
some suggest that both the concepts 
of creationism and evolution should 
be given a chance in the vast aca-
demic arena of a public university. 

Randy G iusta, area director of 
Young Life, a religious organization 
that pairs college students and high 
school students for a mentoring pro-
gram, aclcnowledges the immense 
sea of debate on the issue of sepal'2t-
ing religion in a public university. 
But he believes there is room for 
more options for young students 
who deserve the chance to develop 
their own opinion on the topic. 

However, Guista recognizes that 

teaching theories of evolution to 
high school students is different 
compared to a university setting. 

"In high school, the issue is more 
sensitive," Guista said. "In college, 
students are typically adults." 

E leanor Roosevelt College senior 
Praise Lee, a member of the Korea 
Campus Crusade fo r Christ, said 
that there are times when her reli-
gious beliefs clash with professors 
and the things discussed in class. 

"It's hard, especially in the class-
room, especially when religious top-
ics come up and especially when 
professors talk about something I 
don't believe," Lee said. "It gets me 
frustrated. " 

Lee also sa id that the university 
should be more open to religion and 
not limit students on classes. 

"I don't think that [students in 
Christian schools] should be lim-
ited," Lee said. "And not just for 
Christian classes, fo r any type reli-
gion, srudents should not be limited 
just becausc [religion] doesn't fi t."

Tritons pick up 1--0 ·win over Sonoma 
Men's soccer improves record to 6-2-1 with shutout 

By MICHAEL SCH9ECI 
Senior Staff writer 

The No. 2Z UCSD men's soc-
cer team snapped a long win-
less streak against Sonoma State 
University on Sept. 30. clinching 
a 1-0 win. 

Sophomore Pat Kelly scored off 
a feed from senior Jon Krupansky 
to guide the Tritons (6-2-1 over-
all. 3-2-1 Califomia Collegiate 
Athletic Association) to a victo-
ry over the Seawolves in league 
action at Sonoma State. 

Both sides were evenly matched 
and the Tritons were unable to 
score for the majority of the 
game. 

"We did not have many scor-
ing chances." head coach Derek 
Armstrong said. 

The hard-fought game was 

decided in the 54th minute. when 
a long pass from Krupanslcy found 
Kelly. who put the first goal of his 
career past Sonoma State's goal-
keeper Clark Rupp. 

"It was a tough game. but we 
had a terrific goal that won the 
game." Armstrong said. 

On the other side of the field. 
the UCSD defense was solid. 
recording its fifth team shutout 
of the season and second in a row 
against a CCAA opponent. 

Despite the stingy Triton 
defense. Sonoma State out-shot 
the Tritons 8-7 and herd a 6-1 
advantage in comer kicks. 

Although the Sea wolves took 
more shots. they proved fruit-
less thanks to the performance of 
UCSD senior goalkeeper Edward 
Ruhland, who recorded his third 
shutout of the year and lowered 

his goals-against average to 0.44. 
"We really had to dig in for the 

win." Armstrong said. 
Sonoma State (3 -6-1 overall. 

1-3-0 CCAA) entered the game in 
a tie for fourth place in the CCAA 
North Division with three points. 
joining Cal State Monterey Bay at 
the bottom of the division. 

The game was notable because 
Sonoma State holds a 5 -0-1 all-
time mark against UCSD. The 
win marks the first time in seven 
all-time contests that UCSD has 
bettered Sonoma State. 

The Tritons lost to CCAA 
North Division leader San 
Francisco State 1-0 on Oct. 2. 
DetaiJs were unavailable at press 
time. 

The team's next game will be 
against Cal State San Bernardino 
on Oct. 5 at UCSD. 

Water polo: Tritons await Princeton Tigers 
ctmlinued fram page 16 

match. In the econd quarter. both 
teams scored three goals. while in 
the third. the Tritons and the 4gers 
scored two apiece. 

But the pressure came on when 
Long Beach State caught up to the 
Tritons in the fourth quarter, eve-
ning the score at 8-8 and looking 
for another goal for the win. 

But with only I 0 seconds left. 
and in made- for-TV fashion, Borso 
added another goal to his tally by 
placing one into the 4gers' net. 
ending the march with a 9-8 vic-
tory for the TritQns. 

Borso added four other goals 
in the victory. while sophomo~e 
Adnan Jerkovic recorded two 
more and senior Chris Eichholz 

and junior Ty Lackey added one 
apiece. 

"On any given day. anyone can 
have a great game." Borso said. 
"Everyone was playing really well 
together on Sarurday." 

The victory extended the 
Tritons' overall record to 17-2. 
with only four weeks of play left 
in the regular season. The past 
two times the men took on Long 
Beach State. the finishes were 
equally close. The first time the 
two teams met. on Sept. 18. the 
Tritons won 11-10 in overtime on 
a game-winning goal from senior 
Jonathan Hopkins. The second 
match ended in a 12-IOTriton vic-
tory on Sept. 25. 

"Long Beach State is a really 

good team." head coach Denny 
Harper said. "When we played 
them in the past. there were many 
critical plays throughout the game 
that could go either way." 

The Tritons will have a five-
day break before hosting No. 12 
Princeton University on Oct. 7. 
The Tigers currently hold a 10-
2 overall record and are coming 
off two big wins against the U .S. 
Naval Academy and Johns Hopkins 
University. 

"It will be different playing them 
because they are from the East and 
are a really fast team." Borso said. 
referring to the Tigers. "We have 
a lot of respect for them. but we're 
taking it one game at a time."

lawrence: Padres 'not just an 
easy team to beat,' pitcher says 

conlinued from page 16 
graphs in the stadium's dugout. 
Although 1 failed to get an auto-
graph, I was granted a shon inter-
view with the five-year Padre vet-
eran in which 1 asked about the 
event and his role with the play-
off-bound Padres. 

RE: How did you like working 
on Triton Baseball Field? 

BL: It's nice. Acrually, it 
resembles the college J went to 
a little bit in the way it's laid out. 
T remember just having so much 
fun there and playing the game 
strictly for the love of the game 
and won the job at that point. I 
haven't really hea rd a lot about 
the UCSD program. but ['m sure 
it's doing reall y 
well. 

" 

prepared for the postseason? 
BL: No. you have to stay 

focused anytime you step on a 
major-league field. Nobody wants 
to go out there and get embar-
rassed. so I wanted to go out 
there and pitch the best 1 could 
and that's what I tried to do and 
I had a pretty good game. Like 
I said. anytime you go out there. 
you don 't want to be embarrassed, 
so everybody was trying as hard as 
they could. Even though it was a 
relaxed state of mind because we 
had already clinched. everybody 
was playing hard and we were try-
ing to win a game. 

RE: In the game. you pitched 
nine scoreless innings. prob-

RE: Is this your 
first time working 
with kids. or do 
you do other pro-
grams like this dur-
ing your free time? 

BL: I've worked 
with one or two 
kids individually. 
not as a big group 
like this. so it was 
a learning experi-
ence. But I had fun 
with it and hope-
fully they enjoyed 
it as well. 

[T1he main thing is to 
have fun, and they're 

kids, so they're 
playing far the love of 
the game and it's fun 

to watch." 

ably the best start 
of your season. 
What was going 
through your head 
as you y<ere mow-
ing down the San 
Francisco Giants? 

BL: Well I just 
had everything 
going that day. 
When you can use 
all your pitches 
and you're locat-
ing down in the 
zone like I need 
to. it makes it a lot 
of fun . You can go 
out there and go 

RE: What do 
you think the kids will get out of 
this program? What is your goal 
for today in terms of teaching the 
kids valuable baseball skills and 
other skills? 

BL: I just want them to have 
fun and to learn and do things 
right. But the main thing is to 
have fun. and they're kids. so 
they're playing for the love of the 
game and it's fun to watch . 

RE: You pitched on Sept. 29, a 
day after your Padres clinched the 
NL West. Does your mentality 
change as you go into a game that 
you know doesn't count or do you 
maintain the same focus to stay 

right after some 
hitters. I threw lots of strikes and 
I was able to keep my pitch count 
down. so I was able to go deeper 
into the game. 

RE: The Padres are loolcing at 
one of the worst records of a divi-
sion winner and will likely face 
the Cardinals in the first round. 
What do you have to say to your 
critics who claim that the Padres 
will get swept in the first round? 

BL: I tell them to go back and 
take a look at how we played them 
this season. J think we've played 
them seven times and we're 4-3 
against them. so we're not just an 
easy team to bea t.

Tritons beat Long Beach at buzzer 
Borsa's goal extends overall record to 17-2 

By ANGIE UN 
Associate Sports Editor 

In a highly anticipated and 
close match, the UCSD men's 
water polo team defeated No. 8 
Long Beach State 9-8 on Oct. I 
at Canyonview Pool. 

The win marked the third-
straight victory for the Tritons 
over the 4gers in three consecu-
tive weekends. 

"We had played them twice 
before and both times were in 

a tournament, so we knew it 
would be different," senior cap-
tain Brandon Borso said. "Our 
strategy was just to counterattack 
and out-swim them. We've been 
conditioning a lot in practice and 
are in reaJly good shape, so we 
wanted them to play up to our 
level." 

The No.5 Tritons had antici-
pated a tOugh match against per-
haps one of their tOughest com-
petitOrs this season. As expected, 
the match proved to be a chal-

lenge. 
In the first quarter, the defens-

es dominated, with both teams 
maintaining intense pressure to 
keep it scoreless deep into the 
first frame. However, the TritOns 
found a hole amid the scurry and 
scored the only goal of the quar-
ter, ending it with a 1-0 lead. 

After the first quarter, both 
teams matched each other in 
goa ls throughout the rest of the

UCSD women's soccer 
overwhelms Sonoma 
Tritons trounce Seawolves 1-0, 

gear up for two upcoming games 
By MICHAEL SCHOECK 

Senior Staff Writer 

With the assistance of an asser-
tive defensive line, the No. 12 
UCSD ~omen's soccer team capi-
talized on Sonoma State's defen-
sive woes, holding onto a 1-0 
hard-fought win, their fourth in a 
row, on Sept. 30. 

The Tritons (9-1-0 overall, 5-
1-0 California Collegiate Athletic 
Association) scored the lone goal 
in the game in the 27th minute off 
the foot of sophomore Ali Lai. Lai 
gathered a rebound from a shot by 
junior Megan Dickey to score the 
winning goal. 

Dickey created the Tritons' 
goal opportunity when her shot 
rimmed off the crossbar, bound-
ing down to Lai's feet. 

Lai quicldy beat Sonotaa State 
freshman goalkeeper Carissa 
Arniral to the left and gave UCSD 
what would prove to be an insur-
mountable lead. 

"We scored an important goal 
in the first half and then just 
hung in there," head coach Brian 
McManus said. 

It was Lai's fourth goal of the 
year and the eighth of her colle-
giate career. 

"Offensively, we did fine and 
we created better chances to score 
than Sonoma did," McManus 
said. 

Despite outshooting the 
Tritons 9-8, Sonoma State had 

major scoring woes that contin-
ued throughout the contest. Many 
offensive pushes to the Triton goal 
were attempted, but were unsuc-
cessful. 

Junior Allie Avina anchored the 
defensive line in front of the goa l-
keeping of freshman Mia Shirley. 

The credit for the Tritons' fifth 
shutout of the season lies squarely 
with the abi lities of Avina, Shirley 
and other members of the strong 
defensive line , according to 
McManus. 

"The defenders did very well, 
and put up with difficult shots," 
McManus said. 

Sonoma State entered the game 
with a 2-6-1 overall record and a 
1-2-1 marlc in CCAA play; leav-
ing the team in third place in the 
CCAA North Division, with four 
points, trailing both Chico State 
and Cal State Stanislaus, which 
have 12 points apiece. 

The Tritons came into the 
game following wins over both 
CaJ State Dominguez Hills and 
Cal Poly Pomona in their previ-
ous competitions. 

The win keeps the Tritons on 
top of the CCAA South Division 
with 12 points. 

UCSD beat San Francisco 
State 3-0 on Oct. 2. Details were 
unavailable at press time. 

The Tritons will host con-
ference-rival Cal State San 
Bernardino on Oct. 5, in their 
first matchup of the season.

San Diego Padres' starting

60 local kids on Oct. 1, three 
days after his team clinched the 
National League West Division 
title. 

The "Get Schooled by Brian

brought boys and girls of vari-

ous ages to Triton BasebalJ Field, 
where they participated in hitting, 
pitching, fielding and baserun-
njng drills, taught by Lawrence 
and a number of UCSD baseball 
coaches. Lawrence offered words 
of encouragement and advice as 
he showed the kids how to wind 
up and throw a pitch. 

When one child sporting a 
Padres' jersey stepped on to the 
mound to throw to him, Lawrence 
offered some Padre pride: "You've 
got a Padres' uniform on, let's see 
a strike." 

At the end of the workshop,

Undefeated Broncos lower Tritons' record to 13-3 
By DEL ENlEEN 

Sports Editor 

The women's volleyball team 
dropped its first match in six con-
tests, f.illing to undefeated Cal Poly 
Pomona 3-1 on Oct. 1 at RlMAC 
Arena. 

The No. 10 Tritons (13-3 
overall, 5-2 California Collegiate 
Athletic Association) came into 
the match on a five-game win-
ning streak, including a straight-set 
victoty the night before against 
Cal State Dominguez Hills. The 
No. 18 Broncos proved too strong, 
however, and won the last three 
games after dropping the first one 
to the Tritons. 

In the first game, the Tritons 
fought hard to stay even with 
Pomona at 19-19. Junior Brianna 
Koche's kill and junior Nicole 
Courtney's two aces gave UCSD 
three straight points and a 22-19 
advantage. The Broncos got back 
to within one point, 22-21, before 
UCSD poured on six consecutive 
points to extend its lead to 28-21. 
That lead proved to be enough as 
junior Kristin Halvorsen won the 
game for the Tritons, 30-22, on 
an ace. 

The Broncos came out gallop-
ing in game two, taking a quick 
2-7 lead in their attempt to bounce 
back from the game-one loss. The 
Tritons managed to tie it up twice 
at 12 and 22 apiece, but Cal Poly 
Pomona scored three straight 
points to take a 22-25 lead. The 
lead held up and the Broncos won 
the game 26-30 to tie the match 
up at I - I. 

In game three, the Broncos took 
a 6-13 lead that led to a 26-30 win

Air ti_: Junior Kristin Halvorsen goes airborne for the ball against Cal Poly 
Pomona's Kel/ie Francis in a 3·1 loss to the Broncos on Oct 1 at RIMAe Arena. 
and a 2-1 lead in the match. The 
Tritons got as close as I3 -15, but 
never gained the momentum nec-
essary to overtake the Broncos. 

The Tritons fought hard but 
fell shon in their comeback bid in 
game four, as Pomona maintained 
its spotless record. The score was 

tied as late as 26-26; however, 
Pomona wanted the last four points 
more and won the game 28-30. 

Despite the loss, the Tritons are 
still in the middle of an impressive 
season with 13 wins. 

The Tritons will next travel to 
Cal State Los Angeles on Oct. 6. j
