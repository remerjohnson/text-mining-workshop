Congress shows 
contetnpt toW'ards 
universities 

Congress has acted irresponsibly in its dealings 
with the financial needs of this nation's universities 
and students in 1982. As of this writing, the federal 
government has yet to finalize the budget for student 
aid for the 1982-83 academic year. Universities across 
the cou ntry have already disbursed millions of dollars 
in aid based on projected allocations, and although no 
drastic cutbacks are anticipated, any shortfall will 
have a catastrophic effect on aid·dependent students 
later in the year. 

In addition to this, the newly enacted Pu blic Law 
97·252 places college financial aid offices in the 
position of acting as watchdogs for the Selective 
Service System, using Department of Education 
dollars to ensure compliance with the SSS 
registration law. Any draft-age male who cannot 
prove to the DoE that he has registered will be barred 
from the receipt of federal aid, not by the Justice 
Department, but by financial aid offices. 

The legisiature has a right, a duty, to prevent those 
in violation of federal law from receivin~ federal aid, 
but there are more efficient, more effective means of 
enforcement than to press an already overburdened 
academic community into a new and ethically 
Questionable role as a police force. It is completely 
untenable that that same community be asked to 
function without a firm fiscal commitment from the 
government. 

The performance of our elected representatives 
shows an inexcusable attitude towards the autonomy 
of our educational system. Congress' repeated 
inability to put together a coherent budget clashes 
harshly with its rapid·fire, voice vote invocation of a 
cumbersome new snarl of red tape. 

As w~ ~e faced with an increasingly complex and 
competItive world market, the need tor education 
becomes more acute than ever. In th is light, the 
actions of the legislature border on the suicidal. 
Rhetoric will fill the pages of the Congressional 
Record, but it won't provide quality education, it 
won't develop the intellectual potential of this nation 
and it won't put food on the table. Anybody's table.

A message from the Cape staph 
Editor: 

We at the CAPE Staff would 
like to correct some of the 
errors in your recent article 
and give updated information 
on our status. 

CAPE is currently located in 
Quonset huts behind the 
Warren Provost across the 
street from the bookstore. We 
are in Q·314 , our mailing 
add ress is Q·058 and our phone 
number is X2668. 
The current price for the 
CAPE book is SO¢ and the sta· 
tistical booklet is also SO¢, in 
part to help cover the cost of 
printing. However. the CAPE 
Staff has found partial and 
alternate source of funding to 
cover the rest of our expense. 
We have survived the current 
budget·cutting crunch and 
t here are no plans to discon· 
tinue our existence . 

The current (,81·'82) CAPE 
book will be available this Fri· 

Erratum 
On September 27th, The 

Guardian incorrectly reported 
that there is a bill pending in 
Congress that would require 
all university st udent 
recieving financial aid to 
provide proof that they had 
registered with the Selective 
Service. [n fact , the bill was 
signed into law by President 
Reagan in early September 
and will be in force by next fall.

On your way to see the world 

Travel W'ith UCSD's Education Abroad Progratn 
Labor Day in Scotland, 

Christmas in London. New 
Years eve in Germany. and 

SI:l~r Bowl Sunday hang 
glidmg on a farm in France. 
No. this is not an add for the 
new Navy, but if the above 
locales sound interesting, then 
you might want to look into 
UCSD's Education Abroad 
Program. It could be the key to 
your year of "fear and loathing 
around the world." 

When I tell people stories 
about my year in Europe, they 
think that I won the Grand 
Prize Game, what was behind 
door #4 and the box that Jay 
was holding. What I did do, 
was become a participant in 
the EAP program in the United 
Kingdom. You could do this, or 
go to any of the 22 other 
countries that EAP works in. 
This year more than 650 UC 
student will study in over 40 
host institutions in Asia. 
Australia, the British Isles, 
East and West Africa, Europe. 
Latin America, and the Middle 
East. In exchange, almost 200 
foreign students will come to 
UC on EAP's Reciprocity 
Program. That's right , EAP 
offers you the unique 
opportunity to party abroad 
while earning UC credit. 

The most popular spot is the 
United Kingdom and that is 
due to our common lingo. The 
US and the UK have been said 
to be two countries divided by 
a common language. and after 
a year in the UK I think that 
s tatement carries some 

weight. If you are lucky 
enough to go to Scotland, not 
only will you meet some of the 
greatest people in the world 
but you will learn to say 
" gaeea usa piena eavy 
]ummy." Translated that is 
"can I have a pint of heavy." 
Learning to order beer in 

You will be 
studying in the 
finest 
universities in 
the world 
German, French. Spanish or 
whatever the locals speak. will 
be one of the most taxing jobs 
you will face. Things like that 
will make for a very 
educationally sti mulating 
year. The more adventurous 
will find stimulation in many 
hops and nationalities. 
This program is not just for 

high rollers either. Uncle Sam 
can be a generous man and he 
doe not only buy bombs and 
take per!!onal vacations. He 
might well help you plan a 
little get away by throwing a 
few legal tenders your way. 
Further questons concerning 
bucks should be directed toBig 

Ronnie at 1600 Pennsylvania 
Ave. Maybe you can save time 
by not going through the 
middle men , by writing to the 
Pentagon. 

You should be on the 
payroll , as you will be acting 
as a quasi·public relationsman 
tor the studIOS. You see. the 
Europeans are more than 
curious about our lates t 
moviestar and the cast and 
crew. They will never stop 
with questions about the new 
high budget stage play; Bonzo 
Goes To Washington. They 
can't get over the star. They 
will ask how a man in his 
seventies can stand on one leg 
for such a long time while he 
tries to wrestle his other foot 
Ollt of his mouth . The 

~1ropeans are equally curious 
about proposed acts such as 
Cap Weinberger's plan for a 
one nuke salute for Europe. 
But the one they are really 

Europeans are 
more than cur-
ious about our 
latest movie-
star 
anxious about is the big boy's 
plan to have a real live limited 
nuclear war and open It on the 
road so the Europeans can 

enjoy it first hand. The 
Europeans don't realize how 
much electricity they could 
save if everything glowed at 
night.Anyway they think that 

~on.nie's ~how might t>e play· 
mg m their town any time now. 

Learning to 
order beer ... in 
whatever the 
locals speak 
will be the 
most taxing 

So you better get over there 
while it is still standing and 
there is no better way to see it 
than as a student with a good 
deal of free time. Of course, 
school will not be easy. Far 
from it. You will bestudying in 
some of the finest universities 
in the world. One of the most 
important thing that you will 
do is to show the European 
that most Yanks don 't travel 
with a few war heads or a box 
full of buttons . What you 
might learn if you haven 't 
already, is that kindness and 
honesty, along with greed for 
power, know no political 
borders. People are people no 

matter what t heir government 
might seem to represent. 

Any question about the 
EAP program . hould be 
directed to EAP Coum,elor 
Hannelore Malone at exten· 
sion 3730. The EAP orienta· 
tion meeting wi ll be held 01" 
October 14 at 7:00 p.m. at the 
International Center. There 
will be a film and slide show 
followed by a question and 
answer session with returning 
EAP students.

Letter to the Editor 

Please 
farewell 

don't say 
to TGIFs 

Editor: 

We. the concerned commu· 
ters of UCSD, are forced to 
register a protest against the 
apparent dismantling of a 
hallowed and highly desirable 
tradition at UCSD: the TGIF. 
It has come to our attention 
that the first and conceivably 
only TGIF this quarter will 
not be held until October 22. 
The individual re ponsible for 
this travesty. AS Program· 
ming Commissioner David 
Parker, justifies his unpopular 
decision on several lines of 
dubious reasoning. One of 
these is that most of the 
students attending s uch 
events are on ·ca mpu s 
residents who are not of 
drinking age . Th is is a 
horrendous fabrication. 

A TGIF is one of the few 

occasions when students. and 
even professors, from all 
walks of university life are 
assembled together in a casual 
social situation. It provides an 
opportunity for friends to 
gather at the end of a week of 
scholarly grind to talk. listen 
to live music, and sip on a beer 
or soft drink. For those so 
inclined, there is also the offer 
of outdoor daytime dancing 
and the making of new 
acquaintances. 

Last year, TGIF's were ' 
usually presented every twoor 
three weeks . They were not 
special once a quarter events. 
Rather, they were regarded as 
enjoyable and beneficial AS-
sponsored breaks from the 
academic mill. Now an AS 
officer who pretends to 
represent us is refusing to 
spend our money on an

now be allocated to such

Rolling with the punches 
UCSD battles federal cutbacks 
By THOMAS RANKIN 

News Editor 

This year UCSO's Office of 
Student Financial Services 
(OSFS) will disburse close to 
$8 million in need-based 
financial aid packages to 
students. With the addition of 
Guaranteed Student Loans 
(CSL's) and student employ-
ment , the office will oversee 
the distribution of over $20 
million. 

In addition to the usual 
logi stical problems encoun· 
tered in the handling of 

f~nallcial aid and student 
employment, the office this 
fall is working without a firm 
budgetary commitment for 
federally-funded financial aid 
program which total 
approximately $4,5 million. 

The major complicaton 
came last spring when 
Washington announced new 
Pell Grant rules that required 
~ a full 90 to 100 percent 

~ validation instead of the then 
~ existing 15 to 20 percent. 
i' Administrative guidelines 
;; were not released until mid -

~ summer, which delayed Pell 
~ processing to the point that 

Michael M .... h, a fifth-year poUticai science student, has 
come forth publicly as a DOIl-repstrant with the Selective 
Service. Story bepaa on paae 1. 

they will not be ready for 
dispersal until well into the 
school year. 

Pell awards total $2 million 

Shakeup in the AS council 
By JOHN BRICE 

Staff Writer 
A reliable AS source has 

disclosed to the Guardian that 
a petition to increase the 
council positions to 25 has 
been submitted to the council. 

This was done in compli-
ance with section E of the AS 
constitution, according to the 
source. This section states 
that no council vote can 
override the establishment of 
new council seats. 

Upon receipt of a petition 
signed by 10 percent of the 
student body or upon passage 
by two-thirds of a council 
resolution, the AS must 
establish additional perma· 
nent voting council seats. 
Additionally, sectioh A states 
that such seats shall be filled 
by a general election to be held 
within 12 academic days. 

According to the source. this 
increase in the size of the AS 
would seriously impair council 
effectiveness due to the time 
needed for each concerned 

council member to speak out 
on any particular resolution. 
He concluded that this would 
make the meetings longer than 
"humanly possible." 

Last spring, the budget 
meeting lasted from 6:30 p.m. 
until 3 a.m. with only 23 
members, yet the debate over 
the budget continues this year. 

The continued debate is the 
cause of the call for more 
mem bers, explai ned the 
source. "He said that Reggie 
Williams of the Committee for 
World Democracy (CWO) as 
well as others both in and out 
of the CWD are the instigators 
of this petition with a goal of 

overridin~ Henry Chu's vetoof 
the CWD s funds. 

Williams hand-delivered the 
petition to the AS office 
Wednesday morning, accor-
ding to the source. 

Williams said he did deliver 
it, but added that "he is not the 
root of its support." He 
explained that his goals were 
to "democratize ... and provide

a diverse representation on the 
AS council." 

Comment ing on arguments 
related to the size of the AS, 
Williams said, "Size is not a 
function of the length of a 
meeting, look at the US 
Congress. If a topic merits 
discussion, it merits discus-
sion, The right to enlarge the 
AS is part of the constitution 
which was approved by the 
students. The idea that it will 
disrupt meetings is a self-
serving comment by someone 
in the AS concerned with' 
maintaining the status-quo." 

Williams went on to disclose 
that there is a rumor to the 
effect that the council will try 
to change its by-laws to the 
point where the new posts will 
require stringent job 
discriptions. He argues that 
the discriptions will be so 
demanding that they will 
discourage anyone from 
accepting the posts. Finally, 
Williams said that the problem

at UCSD and are a financial 
mainstay of many tudents' 
aid package. To prevent those 
students from losi ng that 
portion of their package, OSFS 
director Thomas Rutter made 
a fiscal end-run to get checks 
into circulation. 

With the promise of federal 
Pell dollar in the offing, 
Rutter borrowed $575,000 
from the University of 
California. This enabled the 
office to grant students one· 
third of their Pell awards, 
enough to hold them over until 
winter Quarter, when federal 
fund s will have arrived to 
repay the university and 
balance ou t t he remainder of 
the year. 

Another administrative 
headache has been the long· 
tanding problem of an 

outdated, cumbersome 
computer processing depart· 
ment. UCSD must send all 
approved applications to 
UCLA which in turn transfers 
them to UC Berkeley where a 
12-year·old computer program 
is utilized for proces ing. 

This system, called FAlS, 
has been abandoned by all UC 
campuses except UCSD and 
UCLA because of its week-long 
wait and inevitable delays that 
come with shipment up the 
state. Early next year UCLA 
will also stop using FAIS in 
favor of their own system. On 
September 23rd, an entire 
check-generating computer 
tape bound for UCSD was lost, 
requiring a re-run at Berkeley 
and a special PSA night flight 
that got the tape here the 
following morning, one day 
late. . 

The effect of this problem on 
students can be best 
illustrated by comparing FAIS 
with UC Irvine's system, 
generally regarded as the 
state-of-the-art in the UC 
system. If UCSD were to input 
a package into F AlS on August 
3, the checks would not be 
ready for students until 
St'ptember 16. If UC Irvine 
inputs a package on the same 
day , it would be ready for pick-
up on August 25th, over three 
weeks earlier. 

" We have the worst 
complJter system in Financial 
Aid in the UC system," 
OSFS's Rutter admits. He sit 
on a special committee, headed 
by Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affiars Joe 
Watson, whose sole purpose is 
to implement a program to get 

UCSO its own check 
processing computer system. 
The earliest it cou ld be in 
operation, using the "best-
case" scenario, would be the 
1983-84 academic year. 

A new computer system, 
however, will by no means 
olve all long-range problems 

now faced by the OSFS. 
Steady cutbacks from the 
federal government are 
conspiring with inflation and 
skyrocketing fee to force a 
major restructuring of the 
entire aid program. 

During the 1979-80 
academic year, the average 
student budget (as determined 
by the OSFS) wa $4,519. Last 
year the average was $5,639, 
an increa e of 25 percent. 
Need-based grants dnd loans 
over the same period have 
increased only 7.75 percent . 
Starting this year, this gap is 
being filled by GSL's, which 
have become an integral part 
of all financial aid package . 
On the average, GSL's will 
cover about $1,000 of each 
student's yearly need . 

Congress has yet to finalize 
a federal bud~et , and this has 
placed UCSD s OSFS, a well 
as universitie across the US, 
in the position of having to 
disperse federal funds under 
several programs with little or 
no firm commitment to the 
total that will be allocated this 
year. Rutter does not foresee 
any major cutbacks in this are, 
but is operating on guesswork 
based on precedent. Any 
shortfalls would have a 
catastrophic effect on aid-
dependen t students later in 
the year. 

A bright spot in Financial 
Services is UCSD's long-
standing policy of hiring only 
students to cover summer and 
part-time jobs on campus. No 
other UC campus enforces 
such a policy, which opens up 
many jobs to students that 
wou Id otherwise be filled by 
more highly·trained non-
students. 

Many jobs are filled under 
the federally funded Work 
Study program, under which 
the department hiring pays 
only a percentage of the alary 
and the balance is picked up by 
federal fu nds. 

Over the pa t two year , thi 
program ha been cut back 33 
percent. rn 1980-81, the salary 
mix was 80 percent federally-
funded and 20 percent

UCSD's draft resister 
speaks freely _D_O_O._I_S_D_I_! __ fJ. GI?/f;td~' 
continued from page 1 
working in some non-combat 
position, yet in reality they are 
furttwring the military 
objectives. Second, if I were to 
wait until the point where J 
could declare myself a 
C.O.,which would be too late 
to fight for what I am really 
after ... (which) is an end to the 
acceptence of the idea that the 
US can't exist without its 
giant military·industrial 
complex. 

You may never be called on to 
serve. How do you feel about 
that? 

[ believe that it is very 
necessary to fight it at this 
level, at its first stage. I think 
that registration and the draft 
are in fact the same thing. 
Often when a certaim machine 
exists, in this case the defense 
budget as a while, there also 
exists a certain pressure to 
employ this machinery. On the 
other hand, if this machine 
does not exist we avoid the 
potential use of it. 

That is the blank check 
argument. If you have a 
standing army,it tempts the 
government to use it. They see 
a large reserve of manpower 
and it is too much for them to 
resist. Senator Jackson wants 
to initiate the draft now. 

Has anyone reported you to 
the Selective Service for review 
a"d possible prosecution? 

No, and there are supposed-
ly six agencies tracking down 
resisters. This leads me to 
believe that millions of tax 
dollars are going to waste. 

Over 26 months ago I was 
supposed to register and [have 
heard absolutely nothing from 
the government . [ have applied 
for a passport , left the country 
and come back. filed income 
tax twice, and received two 
student loans. 

My point is that since; have 
not said anything no one has 
tracked me. From this I deduce 
that the government is only 
prosecuting individuals who 
exercise their right of the First 
Amendment. 

It has been explained that the 
recent i"crease to 94.2 percent 
compliance in draft registratiml 
is due to the extensive publicity 
over Sasway's case. In other 
words, are you aiding the 
government in acheiving their 
desired goals? 

No, absolutely not. Ben's 
sentence can hardly scare 
anyone. It is harsh considering 

that he should not have been in 
jail in the first place. but 
compared to what it could 
have been, it was light. By 
going public immediatelyn 
after the sentencing. [ hope to 
send out a message to both the 
government and other 
registration-agPd men, that 
the govenment scare tactics, 
which aren ' t so scary, won't 
work. 
Many young men are 
registering because they fear 
govermnent reprisal. But first 
of all I would question the 
government's figures . I believe 
the number of non-registrants: 
500,00 to 700,00 is a more 
meaningful figure, because of 
the courage it takes to stand up 
to the government and social 
norms. For the governmentillo 
say that Ben's stand has 
encouraged people to register 
is a ploy on their part to 
weaken the mes age Ben has 
sent to the nation. 

You have just retumed from 
a year of study in the Middle 
East. How has thateffectedyour 
feelings toward armed conflict 
between nations as a means oj 
settling disagreements? 

It reinforced my total lack of 
support for political violence. [ 
was in Beirut this past 
February and had guns held at 
my head . and I was actually 
held captive by the PLO for 
fifty hours. I have seen 
buildings tha~ were dest royed 
by Israeli bombs. I have seen 
children six and seven and 
even younger with guns. They 
were playing with weapons as 
if they were toys. [ have seen a 
society that has grown to 
accept war and killing as an 
every day occurence. I don't 
want to see that in our 
country. 

Sasway said that he would 
defend his country if we were at 
war. How do yuou think that 
you would react i n that 
situation? 

There are major differences 
between Ben and I. I am a 
pacifist. I would term all wars 
unjust wars. I would term all 
killings unjust killings: . 

The· whole questIOn IS 
hypothetical and very difficult 
to answer. What I will say is 
that my energies would be 
directed towards the pursuit of 
a peaceful solution. For me to 
do justice to this question 
would take hours. I plan to 
write a five page paper to the 
Selective Service on t his very 
topic.

As a political science mayor 
with a 3.3 gpo, how do you 
respond to statements such as 
the following, taken from a San 
Diego Union editorial of 
October 5: what Sasway (and 
you) are doing is "nothing less 
than rejection of representative 
government ... an assertion of 
indi vidual sovereign ty over 
constituted authority, that is 
tantamount to anarchy ... defi-
ancee of American society. "As 
well as additional statements 
made by the federal prosecutor, 
Peter K. Nunez, "thl' price we 
pay for the system we enjoy is an 
obligation to obey the law, and 
the registration is the law." 
Nunez added fhat we all have

Mace sprayed 
at concert in 

• gymnasIum 
BY LISA LAPIN 

Opinion Editor 

Concert-goers got more than 
music and crowds last Sunday 
night in UCSO's gymnasium. 

Over-anx ious security 
guards gave listeners near the 
stage a bath of mace, stinging 
both eyes and tempers. This 
and other security proble'ms 
interupted the concert so often 
that the headliners, Missing 
Persons', threatened several 
times to cancel the show 
entirely. 

Missing Persons' lead sin-
ger, Dale 20zzio told the band 
to stop the music in the middle 
of a song so that she personally 
could talk to the guards. 

She forcefully told them, 
"Stop sprayin~ that stuff! If, 
you don'tstopI II leave! It's not 
nice, and I can't breath." 

One observor commmented 
on the mace s praying, 
"There's was no fighting, nc 
riot. I couldn't understand 
why they did it." 

Problems appeared when 
Missing Persons' first took the 
stage. The capacity crowd of 
2200, one third of whom were 
UCSD students, began topush 
foward towards the front of 
the gym. Two songs later pan-
damonium errupted. 

One of the security guards, 
for Pro-Tect of San Diego, 
"went down" into the crowd. 
The intense pushing from the 
rear caused the crowd to surge 
foward. 

A second security guard 
helped the first man up, pan-
icked, and produced an aerosal 
can of mace and sprayed a 
"fog" over the heads of those 
near the stage. 

Bozzio interupted the con-
cert awhi le later to tell the 
audience, "We requested a 
st rong protective barrier in 
front of the stage, and all they 
give us is a little rope and these 
goon, Watch out in front, 
because these guy mean 
busines ," 

The University Events 
Office soid tickets to t he show, 
but did not hire the security 
guards for this event. In the 
pa t. UEO has hired ecurity 
guards from a group called 
West and there have been no 
problems of this ort. 
The Pro-Teet guard were 
hired by the concert promoter, 
Steve Quercio of Parad ise Con-
cert , who told the Guardian; 

"r want kicls to come to my 
shows and have a good time. 

"The one eeurity guard 
that used the mace could have 
cau ed a real bad ituation. 

"You can bet I'll never use 
those people (Pro-Teet) again." 

Despite repeated attempts 
a,t cont~ct, the Pro· Teet opera-
tIon dId not answer their 
telephone. 

No police reports were filed, 
and UC police were outside 
and dId not witness the events. 

Lat er in the concert Miss-
. IJ ' ' 109 erson~ stopped playing to 
tell the audIence to "Calm 
~own. have a good lime and 
Just move back," 

DespIte th band's warn-
lOgS, later on into the concer a 
fight IJroke out in th crowd, 

The Pro-Teet guards used 
force to remove the in tigators 
of th~ out bur t from the gym 
pr mlses. This action on the 
part of the guards included 
threats with clubs,
