DAVIS - The UC Davis 
Associated Students recently 
passed a resolution denounc-
ing a $181,600 paid leave 
granted to outaoina Clancel-
lor Ted Hullar by the UC 
Board of Regents. Hullar 
defended the university, 
saying tbat ,uch administra-
tive leave stipends are 
customary. Hullar will be the 
last chancellor to receive a 
paid leave, following UC 
President Jack Peltason's 
April 6 decision to end the 
practice.

SANTA BARBARA-
UCSB Academic Senate 
Chair Larry Iannaccone was 
quoted in the March 5 edition 
of the Santa Barbara News-
Press as saying that if 
bilingual education specialist 
Eugene Garcia, who is a top 
contender in the universitY's 
search for a new chancellor, 
is appointed to the position, it 
will only be because the UC 
wants a Hispanic in office. 
The comment prompted a 
flood of letters to the senate 
and a campus forum led by 
the Academic Senate Affir- -.

Senate Delays 
Vote On 
P.E.'s Fate 
DISESTABUSHMENT: P.E. 
Department staff members claim 
they weren't adequately infonned 
ByD ... K,... 
Co-News Editor 

What remains of the UCSD Department of 
Physical Education has been left intact fol-
lowing Tuesday's Academic Senate decision 
to postpone the vote that will determine the 
department's fate. 

The postponement will extend the two-
year-old debate over whether or not the de-
partment should be shut down to save money. 

Proponents of the idea argue that no re-
sources are available to rebuild the depart-
ment which, in the past seven years, has lost 
most of its permanent staff and has had many 
of its functions taken over by other campus 
departments. 

"The university is in serious trouble," said 
senate q.air Stephen Cox. "Every dollar that 
gOCl to a dying department ... is a dollar taken 
from other departments." 

The senate voted 24 to 19 to delay a fmal 
deoiaion on the matter after volleyball in-
aaructor Edwwd MIICbado went on record 
saying that non-tenured faculty received no 
official notice of the upcoming senate vote 
until the day of the meeting. 

"We have continually asked to be involved 
in thil proc:eu... and we have never been 
given that opportunity," Machado said. 

Dean of Arts and Humanities Stanley 
ChodOrow, who led discusaion of the pro-
posal to disestablish the department, con-
tended that he visited physical education staff 
members in person to discuss the matter. 

However, Linda Sundstrom of the Physi-
cal Education department maintained that 
Chodorow visited over a year ago. 

"AU we've had is rumors after that, .. added 
Sundstrom. "1be temporary f~ulty were not 
informed." 

Both physical education faculty and senate 
members agreed that Tuesciay 's decision only 
delayed the inevitable demise of the dcpart-
meaL 

"It', still a dead end," Sundstrom said. 
"(The aenue] is just aoilla to give us a chance 
to apeak tint. "

Scientists Discover 
Cancer Causing Gene 
MEDICINE: Researchers hope to develop an 
efficient screening method to detect the faulty gene 
By Judy WIederhom 
Associate News Editor 

Researchers at the UCSD 
School of Medicine announced last 
week the discovery of a gene that 
they believe causes canceJ. 

The gene, called p16, has been 
found to be either missing or 
mutated in cancer 
patients. The find-
ing was published 
in the April 21 edi-
tion of the journal 
Nature. 

controlling genes also enable cells 
with damaged DNA to pause and 
repair themselves. 

"When this gene is absent, the 
size of ao orgao increases and cells 
are unable to' repair the damaged 
DNA," said Carson. 

AB a result, Carson added, the 
cancer spreads, 
becOming mal ig-
nant. 

According to 
UCSD School of 
Medicine Research 
Associate David 
Wu, researchers al-
ready knew that can-
cer patients laclt a 
gene on chromo-
some nine, but they 
were unable to 
identify it. 

"When tills .ene

According to 
Carson, p 16 is the 
master gene as-
sociated with 
many types of he-
reditary and non-
hereditary can-
cers, including 
leukemia, can-
cers of the lung, 
head and neck, 
bladder, skin and 
brain. 

"We were deter-
mined to isolate 
chromosome nine 
and we finally iden-
tified it through its 
DNA sequence," 
Wu said.

According to Dr.

medical school and

The research 

group, which also 

director of the Sam and Rose Stein 
Institute for Research on Aging, 
"Cancers are an abnormal accu-
mulation of cells. There is an im-
baJance in cell generation and cell 
death." 

In normal patients, all organs 
remain a constant size by main-
taining a balance between cell 
generation and cell death, which 
are controlled by genes sucb as 
p16. 

If a break in these genes re-
sults in the absence or mutation 
of p16~ cells are unable to stop 
dividing. 

Carson added that cell cycle-

tant Professor Dr. Tsutomu 
Nobori and Research Associate 
Agusto Lois, began its study 
about 10 years ago and contin-
ued until p16 was identified on 
Feb. 17 of this year. 

Researchers at the School of 
Medicine are currently screening 
patients for the suspect gene to 
determine if there is either a muta-
tion or an absenceofp16in famil-
ial melanoma patients. 

Once this screening is complete, 
an inexpensive and quick method 
of screening families with a his-
tory of melanoma can be estab-
lished.

The absence of the p16 gene in cancer patients results in 
uncontrollable DNA synthesis and cell growth.

don't believe I was censoring the

president and I have the right to set 
the agenda." 

Despite criticism from Jewish 
forum members, several African-
American students voiced their 
support of the NOI. 

"I'm speaking for myself. The 
NOI shows some beliefs that 
[blacks] look up to. They don't

These brothers are for us, and we're

that,'" Cameron said. 

"I just want you to know who 
we are. We are thinking human 
beings. We've done everythingwe 
can, and it's time for us to come

Members from the UJS also 
expressed their sentiments toward 
the NOl's visit on campus. "I feel 
threatened by the NOI, and I feel 
threatened by their anti-Semitic 
views," said UJS member Inbal 
Israely. 

Israely later added, "We [UJS] 
were told the AASU doesn't nec-

"I spent about a month on that, 
and the Events Review Comittee 
said 'no' . They said that Nine Inch 
Nails was too big, and the crowd 
was too volatile," Earnest said.

said will feature "surprises. " 

"Members of the AASU that 
chose to invite the NOI. .. chose 
to ignore anti-Semitism, and 
that's a threat to me," said UJS 
Vice President Karen Watts. 

Meanwhile, Mrican-Ameri-
can students also voiced anger 
toward an individual who had 
allegedly tape recorded an AASU 
meeting without the 
acknowledgement of its mem-
bers. 

"The issue is that when he 
came into our meeting, he disre-
spected us .... I felt [the AASU 
taping] served to perpetuate a di-

Judicial Board Ruling 
'Unfounded, Costly 

This year's AS. elcctions have proven to be the most ridiculous 
in recent memory. The AS. Judicial Board's ruling against Presi-
dent-elect Poncho Guevara is an eIoqucnt expression ofwby the AS. 
bas lost so much legitimacy in the lISt few years. During the 
campaign, overzealous AS. members charged the two competing 
slates, Students First! and Guevara's Revolutionary Action Claal-
leDging the Establisbment (RAC.E.), witb a series of questiooable 
"campaign violatiolL'l." Last Thursday's ru1ing against Guevara 
(members of Students First! slate are next on the ailting block) 
invalidated the presidential elcctiolL'l. 

The charges stem from the posting of now-infamous Student 
Affinnative Action Committee (SAAq fliers, which endorsed 
Guevara, his running-mate Emelyn de la Pefia and Naomi Falk and 
Jennie Craig of Students First! According to A.S. bylaws, this is a big 
oo-no. University organizations, campus media excepted, are not 
allowed to endorse candidates or referenda in A.S. elections. 

While the Judicial Board concluded that the SAAC endorsement 
had a "substantial effect" on the election results, this is not what moved 
the board to invalidate the presidential election. In a leapoflogic which 
only the A.S. could make, the election was invalidated because 
Guevara was found guilty. As a past chairperson of SMC, Guevara 
was presumed guilty of having had a hand in the SMC fliers. This 
rings of guilt by association, not to mention guilty until proven 
innocent. Even if Guevara had knowledge of the fliers, the proposition 
that he should be held accountable for them is absurd. If the fliers were 
approved by SMC, then SMC should be held responsible. 

Such rudimentary thinking, however, is foreign to members of the 
Judicial Board. In fact, acting Judicial Board Chair Larry Hilman 
thought that Guevara should be grateful for the board's leniency, 
saying, "it was a very fair ruling. .. Poncho could have been removed 
from the elections." Perhaps Craig and Falk will be as hatley. 

. But fairness wasn't the only casualty of the hearing. Adding injury 
to insult, it's estimated that the new elections will cost us around 
S2,(r0. At a time when fees are sIcyrocketing and student organiza-
tions are feeling the "A.S. budget aunch," such squandering of 
resources is partiQlJarly foul. 

A.S. election bylaws should be retooled so that clJargessuch as these 
cannoI be used against candidates in the future. However, the integrity 
of A.S. elections ultimately depends on students playing politics in 
good faith - and that's something much more difficult to CIif~. 

A.S. Programming Has 
Fallen to Mediocrity 

The bands Rage Against the Machine, Dread Zeppelin, Toad the 
Wet Sprocket, the Mighty Mighty 8osstones and Social DisIordon 
all have something in cxmunoa they have performed fn:c concaIs 
at the I1IIIUll UCSD New Musk Fest. Each year tbia festivII, 
SJJOIISOI"d by the Associated Students ~ have bruupt

because of the ineptitude of the progrIIDIDiDg otIice or maybe the 
CIdire A.S., the New Music Fest his been c:ancelled this year. 

Sometbina like this was bound to happen eventually, as the 
prognmmi,. oftice'. wodt has bec:ome sIip&bod IDd plagued with 
mediocrity of life. Sme, abe programmet1 brina us pd DlUIic

COMMENTARY: The women's movement is an essential component of the struggle for equality and justice 

WHY I'M IN THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT 
., H...., Huo Phl_ 
Staff Writer 

TIme and time again ) have been 
asked wby people, and especially a 
teenager like me, would get involved 
in the women's movement. ) don't 

. Imowotberpeople'smotivesfordedi-
cating themselves to a cause, but I can 
shed some light on why I am in-
volved. Last summer my local chap-
ter of the National Organization for 
Women (NOW) sent me to the na-
tional NOW confe.rence in Boston. 
This experience profoundly affected 
me and explains many of the reasons 
why I am willing to spend so much 
time on one cause. 

Women from all reaches of 
American life, from Texan bouse-

wiv~ to Vermont midwives, gatb-
ered in Boston for thisevent.llistcoed

ina up in the days befold~v. Wade

fire of drug warfare. 

The conference wu especially 
importan& to me beca\lle the pater

major American hub of activity for 
tee .. feminisas. ) worked doecly 
with young people willi divene iota-

_andfromdivenc~-

from Harvard-Radcliffe students 
working on educational equity to in-
oer-city African Ame~ working 
with teenage mothers. We all bad 
different reasoM for our activism. 
Some women were abuaed as chil-
dren, others were battling inequality 
in sporIS at their schools. Some came 
to the conference because they were 
curious and wanted to hear the expe-
riences of others. Others wanted to 
exchange information about the best 
ways to spread awareness of women's 
issues. All of us were trying to gain 
knowledge about the tumultuous 
world around us. In workshops, we 
diseu.ssed how feminism can be a very 
personal issue. We attempted to un-
derstand wby eating dis()rders prima-
rily affect women and wby little girls 
have high self-esteem until puberty, 
when it plummets. In these work-
shops we felt safe and empowered. 

We attended the coofercnce to dis-
cuss bow we would lite to change 
0Ul1Ie1ves, but also to diac:usa bow to 
make America a better plaec for all 
people, regardless of age, income, 
rICe, color or gender. On several oc-
c:aions I wu ubd to sit in OIl private 
meetings where NOW's poIic:ieswcre

At the conference I drafted legisla-
tion on NOW's obliplions to teen-

ments from key people within the 
. organization and even debate what ) 

had written in front of an audience of 
tbousands. The legislation passed with 
flying colors! Eleanor Smeal, a major 
figure in the women's movement for 
the last 30 years, came up and con-
gratulated me. Ellie Smeal and I? In-
conceivable. 

The conference also made me 
aware of all the things 1 do not know 
- such as the history of women in 
American society ,the status of women 
in other societies and how similar or 
different their situations are from my 
own. The proceedings of the confer-
ence made me increasingly conscious 
of the fact that the status of women is 
not only a gender issue, but more 
importantly, a human issue, having to 
do with our relationships with men, 
other women, parents, children and 
all the other individuals and institu-
tions we encounter as we move 
through life. In a very real sense, the 
conference was a moment for crystal-
lizing an understanding of my own 
life.

ized just bow important other social 
movements are to the women's cause. 

People have many facets to their 
identity. One isn't black or a woman. 
One is a black woman, or a disabled 
lesbian or what have you. I realized 
that we can never improve the condi-
tion of our lives without working to-
gether. Women cannot gain equality 
if Latinos don't have it and the poor 
don't have it. I realized that social 
problems arebiggerthanjust women 's 
issues. 1be women's movement is 
merely one strand of many. My ac-
tivity within this specialized move-
ment is an attempt to change the world 
at large. 

The work I have done as a teen-
ager has been eye-opening. I have 
begun to see that people care about 
my feminist views and considerthem 
carefully. This has enabled me to 
more dearly see my impact on the 
world. Because of my work, people 
were creating new dialogue. They 
are starting to recognize and deal 
with women's and young people's 
issues. As an activist I have come to 
put more trust in myself and my 
opinions.) am much more willing to 
use my rights and stand up for what) 
believe. I realized that I can make a 
difference .

in both the black and white popula-
tion. We should not accept the ad-
vancement of one group as a result of 
the degradation of another, black or 
white, Jew, Christian or Muslim. 

I want 10 call upon the leaders of 
the African-American Student Union 
and Union of Jewish Students to sit 
down and devise a way by whicb both 
groups can advance their causes with-
out burting one another. After all, our 
Ethiopian-Jewish brothers and sisters 
have shown us that we have far more 

gays, Koreans and whites in general. 
NOI representatives have denouDced 
Jews as "leeches," "Cllrist killers," 
"slave traders" and "bloodsuckers of 
the black community." 

Contrary to theGWll'dian'S biased 
reporting, much of the same rhetoric 
was heard at the UCSD event 10 fact, 
the bate-fiUed rhetoric WIS so intense 
that many people in tile audience were 
in tears after the presentation. 

BothoftheA.S. presidenlialcandi-
dates also attended the event, and it is. 
interesting to note their reactions to the 
NOI. Carla Tesak was so enraged by 
the hatred espoused by the speaker that 
she stormed out of the room in disgust. 
The other candidate, Poncho Guevara, 
gave the speaker a standing ovation. 
Guess which candidate r'm voting for.

this meeting, AASU members reached 
a general consensus that they did not 
necessarily agree with the teachings of 
theNOI, but liked the way tbat the NOI 
favored black empowerment. 

Before the Nation of Islam speaker 
began his tirade, audience members 
were asked 10 leave the first two rows 10 
UIIke room for members of the AASU. 
During the speech, cries of "Tell 'em 
how it is 'teach," "Amen," and "Yes 
sir" emanated from theae first two rows 
in response 10 phrasessuch as "Jews are 
sucking the Iife-blood out of the black 
community" and "Koreans are the mod-
em-(!ay Jew." Can we be a little more 
hypocritical? Four days prior to the 
speech the AASU denounces the harsh 
ideals of the NOI; during the speech, 
African-American students sitting next 
to me were agreeing with a man who 
was espousing racial hatred. 

I generally make a point to dis-
tance myself from campus politics 
and the actions of the A.S. Thank 
goodness that the recent A.S. presi-
dential elections were invalidated. 
After seeing presidential candidate 
Poncho Guevara give Muhammad a 
standing ovation, I will seriously pon-
derwho I will vote for in the upcom-
ing election. As a minority of this 
campus, you have no right to agree 
with the spreading of hatred toward 
the majority and otherrninoritygroups. 

As a member of the Caucasian 
community at UCSD,I am disgusted. 
AsaJew,1 am hurt. As a human being. 
I am disappointed.

dence, Guevara did not applmuJ after 
the speech.

Going Deep 
In Mile High 

·nae's IOIIMJIhlna weird 
JDiDI 011 in baebaII. Home 
runs in tbe majon are up to 46 
percent over last year, with 
players like Houston's Andujar 
Cedeno on pace to hit 40 HR' .. 

What might happen in 
Colorado this season u a result 
of the increased home run 
totals is especially scary to 
lhink about. , 

Everyone Imows that Mile 
High already infIaa offensive 
output, but few reaIizIc 10 what 
ex1iCnL Denver's thin air can add 
40 feet to a 400-foot homer. 

And that's not the only 
advlDtage for hitters. Many 
people don't realize that 
Denver's thin air also causes 
breaking balls to break lell. 
The result is that pitchers serve 
up meat like MacDonald's 
serves Big Macs. 

Utckily, no major slugger 
has called Mile High bome, so 
the numbers aren't utronomi-
cal - yet. If Gonzalez or 
Griffey played tbere, Maris' 
record would probably be 
demolished in no time. 

The record might even 
crumple this year. The Rockies 
have three hitters on pace to 
knock out 60+: Dante 
Bichette, Bills Burb and 
Andres Galmaga. 

Not to take anything away 
from Bichette, who had a 
breakthrough year in '93, but

BALL 

May 4. Head 
coaches can 
consider 
themselves 
lucky be-
cause the Tri-
ton softball 
team will 
most likely 
not be invited 
tothe NCAA 
Oivision III 
playoffs 
when the bids 

are announced. Considering the way 
in the Tritons ilave been demolish-
ing their competition lately, this is 
wonderful news for the other teams 

_aiming for the title. 
"We do deserve to be in the play-

offs, "Head Coach Patricia Gerckcns 
said. "I'm very proud of the way 
we've played, it's just hard to look 
back at the season and not say , 'Boy 
if we had only woo a couple more 
games,''' 

UCSO's lato-season rampage 
continued lut Saturday when the 
TrIIons mauled La Verne ins double-
header, with ICOreS of 5--1 and I()'() 
(in only five innings of play). The 
wins boosted the Tritons' record 
over the .500 mark for the first time 
this season (19-18) and extended 
their current winning streak to six 
games. 

In tho opening game of the 
twiDbiII, the offeaae built an early 4-
o lead behind the strength of a 2-for-
2 outina from Kerri Carter and a 2-
for-3e1ay fromcatcber Emily Rubin. 

UCSO then tumecl the game over 
to Itartin& pitcher Lisa Gil, wbo 
pitched ICVCn iDniDpoffivo-hit ball 

EmIIJ RubIn (left). KrIatIn ........ (rI&ht) aII't convert their let ....... run Into 8ft NCAA berth. 
and allowed juat one run. 

In game two, the Tritons pr0-
duced aU the offense they needed 
Ind then some, pummeling the le0p-
ards for 10 runs in the first two 
innings. Shannon Mounger domi-
nated from the mound, luting five 
innings without allowing a run. 

UCSO's offensive attack wu 
paced by freshmsn Micbelle 
Courtright (2-3, 3 RBis). while Katie 
Galvin, Gil and Carter each tallied 
two RBIs. The eight-run mercy rule 
wu called into effect after the fifth 
inning, and San Diego walked away 
with its third consecutive double-
header sweep. 

"We are very strong right now," 
Gerckens said. "We're just now 
peaking and the girls really don't 
want the scuon to be over." 

The Tritons began the year with 
a dismal 1·7 record and looked to 
have about as much chance of mak-
ing the playoffs IS the Padres. The 
fact that UCSO charged back into 
contention speaks highly of its de-
termination to win. 

"In the past, we had become ac· 
customed to losing. " Gcrckena said, 
"but this year our attitude wu such 
that we expected to win games. I'm 
extremely proud of the way we came 
back thia scuon." 

The turning point in the Tritons' 
season wu the Spring Rebel Games 
in early April. 

"We went to Florida and it did 
wonders for us," Gerc:kenssaid. "We 
played agsinst much better compe-
tition and improved dramatically. 

"We definitely earned a lot of 
respect down lhe stretch this year," 
she added. 

While UCSO's season hu most 
likely come to a close, the young 
San Diego squsd hIS certainly left 
its mark, and come nexl spring, the 
NCAA Division III softball world 
had better be ready for the playoff-
hun&r')' Tritons.

Hiatus Editor 

In one of the opening scenes of 
Jerry Aronson's documentary TM 
Life and Times of Allen Ginsberg, 
'70s talk show host Dick Cavett 
introduces Ginsberg as a "survi-
vor." Cavett aptly describes the 
life of the Beat poet who started 
undercutting the foundations of 
American culture in the '50s with 
what has become a lasting legacy 
of anti-authoritarian art. Aronson's 
film, which opens tomorrow at the 
Ken Theatre, reviews Ginsberg's 
life and his contributions to Ameri-
can culture decade by decade. 

The film starts with Ginsberg's 
childhood, but quickly progresses 
to his artistic career. 

By 1944, Ginsberg had met Jack 
Kerouac, William Burroughs and 
HerbertHuncke. On one wild night, 
Ginsberg was picked up by police 
for driving a stolen car and sent to 
a mental institution after the au-

thorities looked through a journal 
he had in the car. The film is not 
clear about how he dealt with be-
ing institutionalized, but one can 
assume from the context of his 
poem "Howl" that he felt unfairly 
coerced into changing his identity 
as a homosexual poet. 

The publication of "Howl" in 
1955 marked a turning point for 
Ginsberg's career. Ginsberg's de-
scription of a wasted generation 
would resonate into the '60s, a pe-
riod of social upheaval that many 
critics, Michael McLure among 
them, argue was influenced by the 
Beat poets of the '50s. 

Ginsberg's expOsure increased 
in the '60s. While on a campaign 
for peace, he was arrested in Prague, 
showed up in footage from Bob 
Dylan's concert movie Don 'tLook 
Back and protested the Democratic 
convention in Chicago in 1968. 
Like John Lennon, he advocated 
peace and non-violent revolution.

He described the problems of the 
'60s as "the conflict between the 
uptight IDd the turned on." Will-
iam F. Buckley, who interviewed 
him on "Firing Line" in 1968, told 
him, "it's just that in politics you 
are a bit naive." 

Oinsberg continued to stand up 
for social causes in the '70s. Be-
cause the segment on the '80s and 
'90s is so short, the film makes it 
seem like Ginsberg's presence has 
faded. But with a four-disc box set 
produced by Hal Wilner due out in 
June, a new book of poems set for 
publication on May 18 and the pub-
lication of his journals scheduled 
for this year, Ginsberg is still a 
dominant voice in American cul-
ture. Ginsberg will also read from 
his work on May 27 at D.O. Wills 
Bookstore in downtown La Jolla.

Seldom do audie~ get the 
chance to see ItrDng WOlDCll, in 
the lead roles of popular filma. 
Most often females play the love 
interest, the damsel in distress or 
the ornament tbat decorates the 
male star. Witb&ldGiTl.s,direc-
tor Jonathan ~anbreab~ 
stereotypes by casq four lead 
characters who, contruy to the 
moYie's title, are bid IWMWII. 

After kiUing a customer for 
h ...... iDg one of btIr ~tibltea, 
Cody Zamora (Mldeline Stowe 
of StlWoal andUllltlMful EIfIry) 
leads her group of women away 
from a lynch mob and pursues a 
dream of working and ownin8 a 
sawmill in Oregon. Anita (Mary 
Stuart Masterson), Eileen (Andie 
MacDowell) and Ully (Drew 
Banymore) complete the group. 

ThoUgh they have different 
pasts and penonaliti~, the four 
women manage to come together 
as one fighting spirit. As Anita 
declares, "If your laws don't in-
clude me, well they just don't 
apply to me either." 

The film is filled with the fa-
miliar Western mini-plots of a 
bank robbery, a jail break, detec-
tives in pursuit, a kidnapping and 
of course, love. What separates 
this story from that of atraight-
to-video 1!10vies is that &ad Girls 
manages to tactfully poke fun at 
some of the old Western clicb6s. 
The reluctant poue, the nitwit 

bandit and the almost-fumbled 
jailbtealt will surprise audiences 
who think they know what is 
coming next. 

The familiar flees of the four 
leadiDa women make them lik-
able, even thouah they play pros-
titutel, killen and COlI utistII. 
Glimplel of the tribulationsthese 
women have endured make their 
characten sympathetic. Anita's 
busblDd and true love died of 
cholera, forcing her to seU her 
body to make a living. When a 
lawyer tells her that the title she 
holds to their joint property is 
worth nothing without her hus-
band alive, she realizes that in 
the eyes of the law, she is worth 
nothing without a man. " 

Eileen grew up as a poor 
farmer's daughter. In berstruggle 
to find a better life, she discovers 
that she has lost sight of what 
would really make her happy. 
Lilly is a loyal and passionate 
youth who sees the other three 
women as her family and Cody 
as the matriarch, 

Bad Girls also takes advantage 
of the action-adventure scenes that 
audiences always love-there 's a 
nmaway wagon scene and plenty 
oflhoot-outs. This movie provides 
fun and entertainment for both 
men and women. Most impor-
tantly, the story makes one think 
about the status of women in our 
own culture. 

Bad Girls is showing at the-
aten throughout San Diego.

my high school experiences, and 
you never get away from that as 
you grow up. Some of the same 
experiences are relived. I grew up 
in a rural neighborhood and I got

In the past 20 yean, during the 
time wben people in our genera-
tion bave grown up, there was this 
artificial good vibe going on. That 
wore thin and people started to 
think that money could replace 
that. I think the reaction to that is 
what's happened over the past few· 
yem. Artists bave gone back to 
their core feelings. 

Suziclt: I think of the alienation 
as a white teenager's blues,just as 
the blaclt blues of the '401 and 
'50s was expressing social condi-
tions. A lot of kids of our genera-
tion - their parents may be split 
up or on dope. A lot of crazy things 
have bappened in the last 2S years 
as far as the American family goes. 
That' 5 what this Generation X b.s.

lives than they're doing, and it

Nine Inch 
Nails 

Downward Spiral 
..................... 

The scntimentsvocalist-guitar-
ist Trent Reznor expresses on the 
Nine Inch Nails' album Th4Down-
ward Spiral are really not novel, 
but most acts would bave a hard 
time rivaling his intense musical 
performances. 

Spiral is Nine Inch Nails' first 
full-length album since 1989's 
Pretty Hate Machine, which 
yielded the popular singles "Head 
Like a Hole" and "Down In It." 
Since Machine, Nails bas released 
the EP Broken and highlighted a 
recent Lollapalooza tour. Spiral 
was released to such anticipation 
that it immediately soared to the 
top of the sales charts. 

The strength of SpiTal is in its 
rapid shifts of emotions and tone. 
Reznor conveys extreme feelings 
with honesty in "Closer," one 
moment whispering for help and 
the next screaming, "I want to 
fuck you like an animallI want to 
feel you from the inside." 

The sooa "Heresy" sounds like 
something 19th century philoso-
pher Friederick Nietzsche (who 
declared "sod is deadjcould have 
written. In "Heresy, "Reznor sings 
"your god is dead and no one cares! 
if there is a hell I will see you 
there. " Reznor's sentiments aren't 

shocking, but the utter despon-
dency with which he conveys them 
is. 

Although it may seem like Nine 
Inch Nails endorses violence with 
its images of sexual and psycho-
logical manipulation, this is not 
the case. Some songs use parody 
to criticize violent behavior. 

In the song "Big Man with a 
Gun," Reznor is critical of men 
who carry guns to bolster their 
masculinity. He sarcastically sings, 

MU S Ie 

"I have a big gUn/got me a big old 
dick and 1/1 like to bave fun ." The 
title track conveys a similar senti-
ment. Nine Inch Nails combines 
industrial music and despondent 
lyrics to create a bleak world view, 
but the amount of energy it puts 
into the effort demands respect. 

Nine Inch Nails will perform 
Saturday in SDSU's Montezuma 
Hall at 8 p.m. Tickets for the con-
cert are sold out.

Richard Marx 
Paid Vacation 

Compared to past albums such 
as Rush Street and Re~at Of-
ferukr, Richard Marx's new al-
bum Paid Vacation sbows matu-
rity and musical cohesion. The 
fil'llt single, "Now and Forever," 
which also appears on The Get-
away soundtrack, is already a top· 
ten hit. 

"Now and Forever" is dedicated 
to his wife, actress Cynthia 
Rhodes, but not all the tracks on 
Paid 'r'acation are about romantic 
relationships. In the acoustic "Si-
lent Scream," Marx addresses the 
issue of caring for the elderly in 
America. In "Goodbye Holly-
wood," he expresses his dislike 

for the music business, which re-
flects his own decision to move 
back to his hometown of Chicago 
after living for a short time on the 
West Coast. 

Overall,Paid Vacation 's songs 
just fit together well . Marx has 
eradicated the awkward jumps 
between tracks that usually char-
acterize his albums. He has be-
come a mature musician, some-
thing critics such as the Stephen 
Holden of the New York Times 
said he was incapable of. Marx 
provides a pleasant and upbeat 
departure from some of today 's 
more depressing grunge music.

Inch 
Stresser 
......... ,. 

Formed in 1992 from the ashes 
of four other moderately-ac-
claimed local bands, Inch is one of 
San Diego's fastest-rising bands. 
The group, with its blend of dark. 
broad-chorded rock and sweet pop 
melodies, was recently signed to 
Seed Records in New York. 

Its first full-length release, en-
titled Stresser. is in many ways a 
fine album. Unfortunately. two of 
the best songs on the record, "Lin-
ger" and "Oxidizer," have been 
previously released on smaller la-
bels. Several of the tracks on 
Stresser, such as "Kermit the Hos-
tage" or "I'm the Cat" are entirely 
non-memorable, lost in a combi-
nation of generic chord progres-
sions and bland vocals. 

and love, the most tired topics in 
pop music. 

Several of the album's tracks 
are quite stron81 however. "Lin-
ger," which is the first single off 
the album, is a rhythmically infec-
tious and aggressive track that is 
instantly likeable. 

"No. 84 vs S1) A" is another 
song with strong rhythms and an 
innovative bass line which rolls 
under choppy guitar strokes. The 
title track of the record is a fine 
example of Inch's formula of con-
trasting clean, soft melodies with 
driving, guitar-laden anthems. 

The album, produced by Steve 
Haigler (of Quicksand and Pixies 
fame), is an overall strong first 
effort for Inch. Ifthe band contin-
ues to produce songs as good as 
the best on this record, I look for-
ward to hearing subsequent re-
leases.

The biggest problems on this 
album are the lyrics and singing, 
which often feel forced and obvi-
ous. The band employs too many 
clic~ phrases about friendship -o.n Kl'lluu Starts Friday~ April

Ina hard fougllt

The Octopus Criterium, wbicb

Water Skiing 

~,,~z-"'-:b::;V~ ~ done a 
IDOIIIOOtI, the UCSD waterskiina 
team must be lookina forward to 
skiing in a full-blown biuricane. 

Travelinaagain to Northern Cali-
fornia, the UCSD contingent dueled 
with both the 12 other teams present 
and mother nature at the Sacramento 
State Tournament last weekend. 

"1be conditions were horrible, 
especially for the slalom and trick 
events on Saturday when the wind 
wu howling,· UCSD Hoad Coacb 
Bill Scbniderwind said. "I can't re-
member actually skiing in the rain 
before." 

The Week Ahead 

But the inclement weather could 
not slow down several Tritons who 
were intent on making a mark. Jen 
Stem made her first tournament 
complete pass and went on to finish 
with one-and-a-half bouys at 28 
mph. 

On the men's side, Jeff Harris 
broke his own school record in the 
jump by sailing 92 feet - beatina the 
mark he established only a week 
ago. The record wu good enough 
for sixth place. 

Adding to the fun were BiIl80rk 
and Dave Sasse, who finished fourth 
and sixth respectively. 

"When it's u cold u it was, it's 
bard to get warmed up for your 
event. There's no set schedule, you

Deyhimy, who has come on sbong 
for the team in the latter put of this 
leason, led another four-man 
breakaway, crouing the line in third 
place. But the finishes of Dave 
Edwards (sixtb) and teammate 
Bettinger (seventh) proved to be the 
difference in the meet. 

Their points toward the team to-
tal enabled UCSD toout-score S1..O. 

The team's performance allowed 
UCSD to hang on to the 3O-point 
lead and advance with a first-place 
seeding into the Western Collegiate 
eyclinS Conference Champion-
ships, to be held at the University of 
Nevada at Reno on May 7.

your tum," Schniderwind said. 

Harris' performance this season, 
and especially recently, has given 
him an outside chance of becomill8 
a Western Regional All-Star in the 
jump, while Sase and 80rk are in 
good position to qualify for the honor 
in trick. 

On the women's side, senior 
Alison Walmsley, who wu an All-
Star last year, "is a lock to be an All-
Star in trick, and she bu a decent 
chance as an overall skier," 
Schniderwind said. 

Walmsley placed second in trick 
and eighth in the slalom at Sacra-
mento.

UCSD Prays for National Berth 
REIGN DELAY: Tritons overcome weather to record 20th victory over Pt. Lorna 
By Murall Moorthy 
Staff Writer 

Despite reports of heavy rains 
last Tuesday, the UCSD men's ten-
nis team (9-8) caravaned across San 

~-.... 
~~-

• TEnNIS 

Diego to take 
on Pt. Loma 
Nazarene i" 
its final 
matcb f'f the 
season. 

Fortu-
nately. the 
weather sub-
sided for just 
long enough 
to allow the 
Tritons to 
score a 5-1 

victory in the abbreviated contest. 
The win improved San Diego 's 
record against Point Lorna to a domi-
nating 20-0 in dual match competi-
tion. 

In what might be the last match 
of bis college career. number-one 

seed John Qou lost to Victor Vernis. 
6-4. 6-2. The loss ended a disap· 
pointing season for Cross, one which 
began with hopes for top-10 glory 
but ended with a ranking barely in 
the top-30 and an unremarkable 9-
12 record. 

"What can I say, I'm just strug-
gling this year," Cross said. "I'm 
not in the right frame mentally." 

His teammates, however. picked 
up the slack. Two other graduating 
seniors. number two Vern Yarnell 
and number three Roy Gessford, 
ended their careers with straight-set 
wins. 

Dan Brounstein finished a solid 
season at the number-five spot with 
a 6·2, 6·3 win that improved his 
season singles record to a respect. 
able 13·8. Number-six player Jeff 
Young also won in straight sets. 

"Eric [Steidlmayer] did a great 
job when he was in there [for Young]. 
The two of them are battling for that 
spot," said Coach Tim Ditzler,

pleased by the performance of the 
two sophomores. 

The story of the day was num-
ber-four seed Rob Ho. Up 6-3, 5-1 
in the second set and with the team 's 
win riding on the outcome of his 
match, rain forced a is-minute de-
lay. 

Luckily. a brief break in the storm 
and gusty winds permitted the courts 
to dry out long enough for HQ to 
complete a 6-3. 6-2 triumph jusi 
before the storm hit full force. Ho 's 
victory assured the Tritons of a 5-1 
win before rains halted the match. 

Now the waiting game begins. 
Ditzler hopes to get the call from the 
NCAA Selection Commillee that 
will send his team to Nationals in 
Redlands. 

Ranked 12th in the nation but 
only fifth in the west, he hopes that 
some upset losses to contenders in 
the east might be enough to include 
his Tritons in the tournament for the 
ninth consecutive year.
