Development Could Become Another Mission Valley 
Campus Groups Oppose LJ Village Specialty Center

A strong protest is being 
mounted on campus against a 
proposed shopping center to be 
located near U~D.

Bowers contends that " it has to be

best proposal that we'll get. 

"This school is starved for social 
life," Bowers said. " It needs a pub

Should Communicati()ns be a Department? Council Rejects North 
Despite Stu~ent Vote, Question ~s Still Debated City West Proposal 

by Joel C. Don and Scott SacUl 
Associate Newl Editors 

Unable to develop due to administrative and 
departmental disagreement, the future of the 
Communications Program hinges on one central 

This II the second arUcle of a tw.,art series on 
the CommunicatioDS Program at UCSD. 
question: Is the program socially demanding and as 
some faculty and administrative members ask, 
academically "worthy" of achieving the potential 
of departmental autonomy? 

This and related questions are currently being 
considered by not only the principle proponents but 
also by academic review and student committees. 
The findings of these groups and individuals will 
play a major role in determining the policies ef-
fecting the of the nrnorsam 

Paul Saltman 
In the March referendum, students voted over-

whelmingly three to one to "grant full departmental 
status" to the program and the other Third College 
programs of Urban and Rural and Third World 
Studies. In addition, they voted to restore full 
autonomy of the programs over hiring of Full-Time 
Equivalents, or professor appointments. 

But student opinions and needs are not simply the 
sole detenninants of academic policy. According to 
Paul Saltman, Vice~hancellor of Academic Affairs, 
faculty from social science departments par-
ticipating in the Interdisciplinary program will 
ultimately decide if communications warrants 
departmental status. 

"I don't teach biology to meet the needs of the 
students," Saltman said, adcUpg, "I teach biology to 
teach biology. Now I have heard students ten me 
that my biology counes don't meet their needI. 
That's a pity. They ought to go find lOII'aebody who 
meets their needI, or read a book, or if they know 
what they have to learn, it's In the Ulnry. They 
don't need me, they don't need a prolellOl"." 

Third College Provost Joe Watlon, however, 
believes the ultimate goal of communications 
should go beyond an interdilciplinary program and 

m order to be "as high as possible in its academic 
integrity," must obtain more faculty appointments. 

"We have to develop a program to meet the needs 
of all the students who are presently majoring in 
communications," Watson said, in contrast to 
Saltman's statement on student needs. 

And Herbert Schiller, chainnan of the program, 
argues that at issue are not only the needs of the 
students but also those of society. Stating that the 
study of communications deals with some of the 
basic questions of modern society, he asserted: "If 
the university doesn't spend some of its resources in 
examining the components of social existence 
which are where the real tendencies and the real 
everyday life goes on and the processes that are 
absorbing most energies, then it is not paying at-
tention to one of its central tasks." 

These arguments, and the program as a whole, 
are being formally reviewed by a subcolJl!llittee of 
the Academic Senate's Committee on Educational 
Policy (CEP). The purpose of CEP's review is to 
give a description and analysis of the program, 
eventually developing recommendations for 
alleviating current problems and proposing official 
policy for the program's future objectives. 

The five-member review subcommittee includes 
one current member of CEP; two members of the 
UCSD Academic Senate; one faculty member from 
another academic institution and an Wldergraduate 
student majoring in communications. The sub-
committee has met with Schiller, gathered basic 
statistical data on the program and its curricula, 
distributed questioMaires to a large nwnber of 
communications majors and will be interviewing 
several majors on a one-to-one basis. 

Responding to Questionnaires 
In response to the questioMaire, member.s of the 

Communications Student Union (CSU) are in the 
process of drafting a formal reply in order to point 
out issues not directly attended to in the question-
naire. 

One of the issues coming before the subcommittee 
is the contention that many students enroll in the 
program because of the rwnored undemanding 
nature in some of the communications courses. Is it, 
as Saltman asks: "The easiest way to get through 
UCSD without studying a lot?" 

"As far as I can tell, there is no real evidence for 
it," said Provost Watson. "The only thing I have 
done is looked at the grades in corrununications and 
compared them to other departments. There 
doesn't seem to be much difference. 

"One hears about these things, and they're sort of 
back room rumors as I like to describe it. I have 
always urged people to come forward and give 
specifics and if I have specifics I'm willing to sit 
down with anybody and try to correct the problem," 
he added.

The City Council has rejected the financing concept for the first phase 
of North City West (New), a 4300-acre controversial housing develo~ 
ment planned for the area east of Del Mar near Interstate 5. 

The 5-4 vote means the development-which would have ultimately 
housed 40,000 persons in 12,000 houses and condominiums-" is dead," 
according to councilman Tom Gade. 

The- same attitude was taken by 
Janay Kruger , of the NCW 
property· owners' group, who said, 
" Without City Council support and 
city staff cooperation, we have 
nothing. I guess the development is 
dead." 

Morrow Casts Vote 
The deciding vote was cast by 

Floyd Morrow, who also delivered 
the deciding vote two years ago, 
when the council approved the 
New concept by the same 5-4 vote. 

When he voted to approve New 
in 1975, Morrow precisely outlined 
the conditions for his continuing 
support for the development. He 
said he wanted to make sure all 
service charges were paid for by 
NCW property owners, rather than 
by other city residents. 

After reviewing the financing 
method proposed by New property 
owners, Morrow said it does not 
meet the criteria he set two years 
ago. 

Voting against the plan were 
Mayor Wilson and coun-
cilmembers Maureen O'Connor, 
Leon Williams, Jess Haro and 
Morrow. Voting in favor of the plan 
were councilmen Lee Hubbard, 
Tom Gade, Gil Johnson and Mac 
Strobl. 

"Logical'" Seaslble" 
Not all the NCW supporters 1m'e 

willing to say NCW 18 dead. 
Hubbard, said the development, as 
it is "logical and sensible," will 
probably resurface in the future. 

The development baa been op-
posed by both U~D student 
organizations and the Del Mar City 
Council. 

Rally Set to 
Hit Arrests, 
Investments 

A rally to protest UC in-
vestments in South Africa will be 
held today at noon on Revelle 
Plaza. 

Featured speakers will include 
Emily Hicks, Lit. Grad. student, 
Anthony Ngubo, UCSD Sociology 
Professor, Stanley Aronowitz, 
author of False Promises, a book 
discussing the history of the 
American working class and the 
Rev'd AI Dortch. 

Such topics as the recent 
massive arrests of Students 
protesting UC involvement with 
South Africa at Santa Cruz, 
Stanford, and Davis, and local 
issues which relate with the US 
global policy and treatment rI. 
South Africa, will also be 
discussed. 

CUltural events will also take 
place this afternoon on Matthews 
Campus. Included will be singing 
and dancing, and discussion of a 
number of pertinent issues. 

Educational seminars and 
mov 'es have been taking place this 
week in preparation for the rally. A 
numher of student groups have 
been involved with the discussions 
and have combined as a coalition 
sponsoring the rally.

YS Tells "Big Lie" about Israel

article in the May 18 issue of the 
Triton Times. A careful reading of 
!he YS/I. article points to that 
"progressive" organization's true 
colors: it is a misguided, blatantly 
antisemitic (and therefore racist) 
organization, willing to engage in a

Furthermore, it was 8 non-

Hunt Replies to Task Force 
On Campus Lighting Isue 

This is in reply to your letter of May 2,Tegarding lighting on campus. I 
understand that your group met last night with Al Rae, UCSD Environ-
mental and Safety Officer and that in the courSe of your meeting you were 
apprised that out of the seven lights reported to be out 0: order, six have 
been repaired. Rae informed me that the wiring had been cut on the 
seventh light, and it will take more time to trace the cut and make the 
needed repairs . 

Rae also stated that the light you reported out of order two weeks ago 
has been repaired, which seems to cover all items included in your letter 
ofMay2. 

Regarding the campus map which Rae has issued to all custodial staff, 
it is my understanding that he is currently pursuing the possibility of 
making copies of the map and distributing them to all studeht affairs 
personnel, as well as to interested students. The purpose of the map is to 
make it easier to identify specific lights, thus facilitating the reporting of 
malfunctioning lights to the Trouble Desk. 

Your request that an item be included in the next issue of 'The car-
buretor' informing students of what number to call when noticing any 
lights out, for the safety of all students, has been forwarded to JoAnn 
Ritchie, Student Advisor Coordinator, who is in charge of gathering copy 
and producing the next issue of 'The Carburetor' . 

1 believe this covers your current concerns, and I appreciate your 
calling to my attention the delay in repairing the lights. You may rest 
assured that Rae's office will process all reports of malfunctioning lights 
with maximum dispatch; our students' safety is of paramount im-

nwnber of other nations dealt with 
the racist state. (New York TImes, 
Nov. 3, 1978). The thrust of my 
article was to point out that the 
YSA singled out Israel, when in 
fact it contributes only 1 percent to 
the South African GNP. (UPI, May 
3,1977). 

And how did the YSA respond to 
my article? It stated that the IS 
Black African states dealing with 
South Africa do so beca\llle those 
are nations with "underdeveloped, 
dependent economies who are 
forced to trade with South Africa 
out of economic necessity." What 
kind of hypocrisy and double-
standardism is that? 

I detest Israel's involvement 
with South Africa. However, if the 
YSA is justifying 19 Black African 
states' dealings with ~th Africa 
due to economic needs, then Israel 
is as dubiously qualifled to fall 
under that justification, as applied 
by the YSA. For the record: 
Israel's annual rate of inflation is 
close to 40 percent, lDlemployment 
is high, its balance of trade is 
extremely unfavorable, its foreign 
reserves have dwindled alar-
mingly and strikes and work 
stoppages are the norm in Israel's 
beleaguered economy. 

Again, I would hope that Israel 
would rid itself of its dealings with 
South Africa. But, as before, the 
YSA conveniently forgets to 
present the situation in its true 
fonn, and thel'j!fore reveals its 
latent double-standardism and 
hypocrisy. 

Another Big Lie is the charge by 
the YSA that American Zionists 
opposed the lifting of US im-
migration quotas after World War 
II, so that European Jews would 
instead be forced to immigrate to 
Israel. No single Jewish 
organizations such as the Hebrew 
lnunigrant Aid Society (HIAS), the 
B'nai B'rith and nwnerous other 
groups were instrumental in fin-
ding homes and jobs for the 01>-
pressed Jewish refugees of 
Europe. 

Perhaps the YSA does not realize 
that among the ultimate 
obligations of Jewish Law is the' 
requirement that Jews must do 
anything and everything pOllllible 
to secure the freedom of their 
oppressed brothers and sisters, 
and to ensure the wellbeing of the 
less fOriuhate. 

One final point: nationalism is 
benignly accepted in every single 
nation of the world. Only in regards 
to Israel is nationalism on the part 
of Jews condemned. Furthermore, 
if the YSA can claim that Israel is a 
"settler state," then few nations 
today can lay claim to the land on 
which they rest. If 2000 years of 
Jewish settlement and history are 
not .requirements for legitimacy, 
then perhaps nothing is.

Integratlag Saa Diego'. Scboo" 
San Diego is headed for its own showdown at the schoolhouse door. Or 

rather, a battle over integration in the coming years. ' 
The Citizens' Ad\tlsory Conunission on Racial IntegratiOn has 

presented its recommendations to the Board of Education on bow San 
Diego should comply with Judge Louis Welsh's CarUn case-order to in-
tegrate 23 area schools. The board is expected to accept the recom-
mendatiorm-which are to continue voluntary integration next year but 
begin plallllirll! mandatory busing in case the voluntary efforts f;U to 
meet Welsh's order. 

The commission had a hard time compiling recommendations, working 
over the past several months. And, appropriately, it was split on the same 
subject that bothers the citizenry at large: busing. Some members-a 
distinct minority-favored immediate mandatory busing, whlle others 
suggested avoiding that measure if atall possible. 

The feeling of most commission members-that forced busing be 
avoided-is matched by the feelin8s of most San Diegans. A recent city-
wide survey has iridicated San Diegans will vote against future bond 
issues that would be necessary to fund mandatory busing. 

So why did the issue that unites most San Dlegans in opposition divide 
the commission? Because Its members knew some kind of forced busing 
will undoubtedly prove necessary to meet Welsh's order. Yet commission 
members tried to limit busing discussion to questions of when it will be 
necessary. 

still, the ' fact is that Welsh ordered the 23 schools integrated. He said 
mandatory busing should be used only as a last resort. But he also said 
the schools must be integrated. 

Now, mandatory busing is being used as an ever-present threat held 
just off-stage, to be used In case voluntary programs don't work. Such an 
idea is foolish. People who oppose moving their kids to another school 
under mandatory plans aren't about to put them in a voluntary program 
that has the same result, just to save other children from being bused. 
That isn't the way human nature works. 

Such resistance to even voluntary programs is shown in the results of 
current voluntary plans. According to San Diego Executive Director 
Clarence Pendleton the current area voluntary programs are used 
primarily, (90 percent) by black students. 

Resistance to any form of busing has also shown up at the public 
meetings recently held to allow San Diegans a chance to express their 
views on racial integration. Most of those meetings were very crowded, 
especially the one staged at Muirlands Jr. High School In La Jolla. The 
attitude of people at that meeting was apparent from the beginning : they 
asked " Are you going to try ~ing my kid?" and indicated they hope the 
answer is no. Those people were scared; they don' t want their children 
sent to schools in Southeast San Diego that they consider inadequate and 
hostile to whites. 

It also seemed the people at the meeting, having observed the course of 
integration struggles across the country, feel the inevitability of some 
kind of mandatory busing-in the future. As North Shores SeDUnel writer 
Ed Simons reported, a young man in one of the small' group dtscuss10ns 
suggested building magnet schools in " neutral areas." Why? Because 
"all we have to do is show intent. If it takes ten years to build the schools 
it takes ten years. " ' 

But in the end the question that . must be asked-that is too often 
skimmed over-is why should San Diego schools to be integrated? Not to 
provide a quality education for all the children. Welsh found southeast 
schools to be just as good if not better than other schools. No, the order to 
integrate the schools is a recognition of their socialization flDlctlon. 
Schools are supposed to smoothly integrate children into society. 
Integrated schools will bopefully be a strong step toward ending 
Arnericjl's race problems. 

y et, ~us~ transporting white kids to schools with black kids and vice 
versa,. IS~ t enough to accomplish the socialization purpose. The in-
teraction IS too fragmented. The kids see each other at school but because 
they live in different neighborhoods that's the only time they are 
together. 

The only real way to inte~rate s<x;iety - and that's wbat'we're really 
talking about, not merely mtegratmg the schools-is to desegregate 
housing. People have to live together, not just see each other for a few 
hours at school. BUSing is more like the old bandaid on the burst water-
main : it :mly holds back the explosion a little longer. 

EARliER FEE DEAdliNES SET 'FOR 1911118 
A study over the past year revealed that current registration fee 

deadlines are creating more problems for students and faculty 
than the original !ntent which allowed stUdents to enroll early but 
not pay fees until classes were actually in session. Class rosters 
then, in~luded all students who enrolled early but had not 

I_necessarily paid registration fees. 
By filing the fee deadline approlimate" two wHks before 

classes actually begin [still later than most other campuses] the 
Registrar's Office will be able to produce accurate class rosters for 
faculty before the start of each quarter and , n a result in-
structors will be able to manage class size more effectiNly ~ the 
first day of instruction and throughout the ad/drop period. 

Students are encouraged to pay their fen by mail and an 
envelope addressed to the Cashier's Office is included In student

Schiller, m ~greeme!lt with Watson, asked how anyone can make such 
s~atements ~Ithout eVidence and data other than "the most off the cuff 
Viewpoint which one already believes to be the situation." 
. Sal~n also suggested that the program's refusal to crosslist courses 
IS a strategy" and a "tacti~". "It's a marvelollS device to get 
enrollm~~ up in conununicatioll8 courses," he claimed. Cross~mg is the practice of offering courses under multiple depart-
ment deSignations. For example, a COW'Se listed under corrununications 
could also be 1isted with the same number under visual arts Thus the 
same course could be used by a student majoring in either field : 

. Stude .. There for Coarse. . 
Schiller responded to Saltman's contention by saying "We don't have to 

take such st~t.ems, we don't have to think in such Machiavellian 
tenns. We denve our students from the fact that they come to our courses 
and want our courses. 

" We 're only too happy to crosslist cour~," he added, saying, "We try 
to .have as many.of our students take as many courses thro\l8hout the 
uDlversity as possible. 

" When we get students, we get them, I believe exclusively on the basis 
?f what . we've de~onstrated in tenns of our ~lassroom work and the 
mterest mherently m the subject," he stated. 

The program, however, is not alone in its struggle to gain academic 
accep~nce. In a recent action on the UCLA campllS, the Executive 
Cornnutt~ of the Co~e of Letters and Sciences voted to phase-out the 
Communications Studies major. 

H~~ever, the faculty of the college mo.ved to Wednesday to send the 
deCISion back to the executive committee with instructions to consult with 

t~ Academic Senate's committee on undergraduate curricula. Recon-
sideration of th~ conununications issue will not occur until fall quarter 

an~ stu~nts w~~ be. allowed to continue and enfer the studies progrsrn 
until a fmal deCISion IS made. 

C~enting ~ the executive committee's initial action, Com-
munications Studies Chainnan Paul L. Rosenthal said in the DaOy 
Bruin: ':It's an .ou~geous decision. Totally outrageo~. It's in total 
unconsclona.ble mdifferen<:e to legitimate undergraduate student in-
teres~. It flies in ,the face of all the available evidence in front of that 
committee that this program is a viable and excellent undergraduate 
program." 
. S~~r to UCSO's program, the UCLA communications studies faculty 
IS limlted to two regular faculty and two temporary faculty and an 
enrollment of 250 students.

Tirsma also elq)lained that the 
Wl8nimoUS opposition from GSC 
stenuned from the increased 
demands of hous ing in the 
University area of which there is 
already a shortage. He contends 
that the housing proposal su\). 
nutted by the May-Bren cor-
poration is grossly inadequate. 

Housing Included In Propo'" 
The housing which is included 

within the proposal includes 115 
apartments by the specialty center 
in addition to 33 apartments, some 
to be built on top of stores. Also, the 
Bren corporation is plaMing to 
build 400 condominiums west of the 
La Jolla Village 1M. According to 
the Environmental Impact report, 
the condominiums could be 
oriented towards students. Howard 
Nopper, a spokesperson for the 
Bren corporation, maintained that 
the sale price of each condominium 
would be upwards of $70,000. 

(A rough estimate . utilizing 
current market rates indicates 
that the condominiums could be 
rented out at approximately 
$6OO/month.)

Summer Sessi'on 
Parking 

Parking permits are required on campus 
during the summer months. 
Parking regulations remain the same as 
during the academic year. 
Summer session permits may be purchased 
at the cashier's office, Me 401, beginning 
the second week of June .... Or you may 
purchase an annual 77 -78 "s" (student) perm it. 

I 

·1 NOTE! 
"s ' (Student perm its are not valid at S10 

(Scripps Institution of Oceanography) during 
the summer except on weekend and holidays 
in the south lots only. 

If you need additional information please call parking 
services on x4223 or stop by Buil~ing 400 on Me. 

would be student oriented, there 
would be no tchooll or Ubraries 
built to serve the area. Instead, the 
facilities of the University would 
be utilized by the residents, 

When asked if the high cost of 
such housing would be a deterrent 
to students, Ken Bowers contended 
that the students could group 
together in the condo~\IIJlII. 
"They could be bought and rented 
out to four or six students for the 
course of the year." 

A member of GSC, however, 
termed the proposal ridiculous. 
"Students are not going to live six 
in a condominium. And even if they 
were willing to, what owner would 
let them? It's laughable." 

Another controversial issue is 
the impact of traffic on the 
University. Even though the 
Environmental Impact Report 
states that most streets around the 
University area could 'handle the 
traffic load, intersections and 
streets would become extremely 
crowded during peak traffic 
periods. 

But, according to the business 
office, there would be no peak 
traffic period. Instead, the load 
would be spread out throughout ~ 
day "because no one large crowd 
would be coming and going at the 
same time." 

Judith Munk, a local concerned 
citizen on a group opposing the 
proposal, thinks otherwise, saying, 
"Throughout the enUre day there 
will be peak traffic." 

" In ten years, this University 
won't be the same place," she said. 
" It will have a serious effect on the 
quality of life by the University. 
The streets will be much more 
crowded than they are now." 

Concern has been expressed by 
many people that the appeal, set 
for the City Council . next Wed-
nesday, would be moved because 
of possible' student involvement in 
the matter. Students are en-
couraged to call the La Jolla Town 
Council at 454-1444 for more In-
formation if

Communications... 
Continued from Page 3 

autonomy versus interdisciplinary 
has been resolved. On the un-
dergraduate level , bachelor's 
degrees are offered in the applied 
fields of journalism, advertising 
and radio-television. 

The Ph.D. program incorporates 
theoretical research in an In-
terdisciplinary framework. When 
asked whether undergraduate 
communications programs should 
be developed into autonomous 
departments, Theodore Peterson, 
Dean of the College of Com-
munications, said he has " mixed 
feelings" about it, in a recent 
telephone interview. 

"00 the one hand, I feel that 
communications is a legitimate 
field of study. It seems as logical to . 
me that you can study it as you can 
study sociology or political 
science. 

"00 the other hand, we have 
considered having such a program 
here (on the undergraduate level, 
in addition to their professionally 
oriented majors). The reservation ' 
I have is simply a practical one 01 
what the student does after he gets 
his bachelor's degree. But 
technically that should be no 
concern. You don't worry about 
what it poUtical scientist does with 
his bachelor's'degree," he added. 

The future of the com- '-
munications program on this 
campus, and its potential for 
development, depends on its ae-
cpetance as a discipline demanded 
by the growth of a mass-medlated 
SOCiety.

.Runs 48.4 in 400 Meters 

Morning Fails to Qualify Intercollegiate Sports Survey by Jon Halperin 
Sportll Editor 

" I was pretty well mashed" 
were the words Kevin Morning 
used to describe his performance 
in last week's NAIA National 
Championship meet in 
Arkadelphia , Arkansas. Morning 
ran a 48.4 second clocking in his 400 
meter preliminary heat and was 
edged out of the fifth and final 
qualifying berth. 

Morning came to the meet as a 
result of his impressive victory in 
the NAIA District III Cham-

pionships of the week before. It 
became apparent, however, that 
the highly competent junior was a 
little over his head among the top 
caliber competition. 

Misses Coaching 
Morning felt that the absence of 

coaches Andy Skief and Don 
Strebel .was detrimental to his 
performance. " I was all alone out 
there, and really had no one to 
confer with before my race." 

Like a Vacation 
"It was like a vacation", Mor-

ning mused, " I had a real good 
time and more importantly met 

some really interesting people. 
Everyone was so friendly. It was 
really a good experience." 

Next yea r will be no vacation 
Morning has promised. He has set 
his sights on the 400 meter in-
termediate hurdles and possibly 
the 800 meter dash. They will not 
ha ve Kevin Morning to kick around 
any more. 

Morning will now concentrate 
on his upcoming NAIA tour of 
China. He is scheduled to leave on 
July 1 and is expected to return at 
the middle of the month. 

In an effort to best serve the students on campus, your opinion on the 
UCSD Intercollegiate Athletic Program is being sought. Please com-
plete the following Questions and return to the Triton Times office (Mail
