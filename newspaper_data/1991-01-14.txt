UCSD's Sweet Elected NCAA President 
• Athletic director becomes first woman and first individual 
from a Division III school elected to the national post 
By PeterKo 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD Athletic Director Judith 
Sweet broke through two long-
standing barriers in college athletics 
Thursday night when she was elected 
NCAA president at the annual 
NCAA Convention in Nashville, 
Tennessee. 

leged to have an opportunity to serve 
as NCAA president," Sweet said. 

In her new capacity, Sweet will 
preside over the NCAA's 800-plu 
member institution ,as well as the 
NCAA Council- the association' s 
legislative body. 

Still, unfiI her nomination last 
October. she did not expect to climb 
any higher in the NCAA hierarchy. 

She will also oversee the execu-
tivecommitteemeeting ,whichdeal 
with finances in the as ociation. and 
the annual convention. 

"When I was elected secretary-
treasurer. I thought, in all honesty. 
that would be as far as I would have 
an opportunity to go in the tructure." 
Sweet aid. 

Sweet i the first female presi-
dent elected in the 85-year history 
of the convention. She is also the 
ftrst president from a Division ill 
school. 

Sweet served as secretary-trea-
surer for the past two years, a posi-
tion which has a history of leading 
to the presidency. 

'There had been talk of trying to 
break the pattern of having the sec-
retary-treasurer move to president 
becau e of the tremendous time 
commitment it takes an individual 
for four consecutive years.

Four New State Laws Will Affect 
UC Campuses If Regents Approve 
• The legislation would affect campus lighting, the 
disabled, rape counseling, and crime statistics 
By Eric Schmidt 
Staff Writer 

Four new state laws regulating most Califor-
niacolleges and universities went into effect as of 
Jan. 1. 

Under an article in the state constitution which 
grants the UC Regents full autonomy from the 
state, the new laws do not apply to UC, although 
the regents may choose independently to adopt 
the policies. 

Laws requiring disclosure of all crime statis-
tics. written procedures for helping rape victims, 
more campus lighting, and more parking for 
disabled students passed in the state legislature 
last year. 

According to UCSD Police Chief John 
Anderson, UCSD already complies with the pr0-
visions of the Crime Statistics Act. which obliges 
colleges to release all campus crime statistics to 
students. staff, and applicants. 

"Ibis university has been the forerunner of 
[releasing crime statistics). The law is much more 
directed towards private institutions," Anderson 
said. 

UCSD releases aU crime statistics to certain 
groups quarterly and to everyone annually, 8C-
cordinJ to Anderson. 

Anderson said a major advantage of the law 
is that it creates an equality between public and 
private colleges in terms of crime statistics, 
which may influence the number of applica-
tions colleges will receive . 

"Pri vate schools need to handle crime statis-
tics the way we do." Anderson commented. 

Associated Students President John Edson 
agreed that the new law will mainly affect 
private universities. 

Edson added that posted figures will become 
a "public yardstick" of campus crime, which 
could incite change even in public universities. 

When statistics are first widely released, 
Edson said, "there will be a major shock to all 
applying. but later there would be incentive for 
the universities to improve." 11uough this com-
petition. crime statistics statewide will eventu-
ally fall. he said. 

Edson said that he believes UCSD is a rela-
tively safe campus. but "every campus is unsafe 
in certain ways." He cited certain new shuttle 
stops in unlit areas which could cause problems 
at night. 

A new state regulation requiring additional 
campus lighting may solve those potcntial crime

New State Budget 
Will Bring Massive 
UC Fee Increases 
By Melinda Hamilton 
Associate News Editor 

Governor Pete Wil on presented the legisla-
ture with his budget propo al for 1991-92 Thurs-
day, including dra tic cuts in the amount of funds 
that public universities and college will receive 
from the state and a 20 percent increase in fee for 
UC students. 

Under the governor's proposed plan, student 
fees would increase by $325 a year for California 
residen!s, to $ 1,949 a year. 

The university requested an operating budget 
of$2.48 billion to maintain curren! program after 
adjustment for inflation and enrollment growth. 

Wilson's proposal provides only $2.19 billion. 
a reducrjon of $2.2 million over the current bud-
get. 

According to Associated Students President 
John Edson, the proposed budget means a $295 
million total loss to the university. He divided the 
cuts into two categories, allocated and unallo-
cated. 

Edson said that the allocated cuts, which are 
outlined in the budget proposal, incl ude withhold-
ing salary increases to faculty and staff, cutting 
graduate student enrollment, and raising student 
fees. In addition, funds already spent by the 
university for research will not be reimbursed. 

Edson said that the unallocated cuts will be 
dealt with by the university, most likely coming 
from reductions in overhead costs, instruction and 
research, $73 million in undesignated cuts, and 
flxed costs such as water and electricity. 

The opening of a new UC campus, a UC 
representative office in Washington,D.C.,andan 
Office of the President branch for the southern 
campuses have all been delayed indefinitely as a 
result of the cuts, Edson added. 

The Long Term Student Fee Policy (SB 1645). 
implemented in 1985. requires that fee increases 
be limited to 10 percent in any year, which effec-
tively makes Wilson's suggested increase of 20 
percent illegal. 

"This is the first time that attempts have been 
made by a governor to supersede the fee policy." 
said Susan Polan, UC Student Association presi-
dent and UC Irvine graduate student. 

'The whole intent of the student fee increase 
policy was to establish an agreement between 
students and the state that would provide for fair 
and equitable fee increases," Polan explained. 

"Any proposals to exceed the 10 percent limit 
would be a severe violation of this long-standing 
agreement," she continued. 

Under Article 9. Section 9 of the state consti-
tution. the regents are granted full autonomy from

SWEET: UCSD A.D. is 
new NCAA president 
ContInued from pege 1 

"[And] with my Division m background, 1 wasn'tsurethar 
the association would be willing 10 support someone outside 
Division I. given the large issues that had been facing 
intercollegiate adlIetics are primarily Division I issues, Of she 
explained. 

Sweecdoes not expect her new position to conflict withbcr 
duties as UCSD adJletic director. 

"I hope it will just make me better 81 whal I do at UCSD," 
she said. "Idon't anlicipete that it will be any more demanding 
or much more demanding dwJ the past two years have been 
during my tenure as sc:cretary-treasurer." 

Sweet's two-yeartenn as successortooutgoingPresidenI 
AI Witte of the University of ArtaILus began immediately 
when she presided over a Friday morning meeting of the 
NCAA Council. 

One of the major coocems facing Sweet during her tenure 
will be the so-called "reform package," a revolutionary set of 
IegislaIiveproposalsdesignedlOgetuniversiliesmoreinvolved 
in college atbletics. 

Among the proposals are scholarship cuts, practice time-
limits. and stiffer academic requirements. 

Sweet is fully aware of the package's signficance. 
"We need to refine the proposals that were passed," she 

said. "We need to make sure that they really do what we 
intended them to do. 

"I think [the changes] are represmwiveofthe willingness 
of the membership 10 acknowledge that there are things in 
college athletics that need 10 change .. . that we are willing to 
do whalis necessary 10 try to make things beuerthan they IR." 

Sweet bas several other goals as well. 
"My number one priority is to build on the improved 

conununication and cooperation that was demonstrated at the 
convention [this] year," she said. "I think [that] ifwecontinue 
to work with all constituencies in themembership, that we can 
identifymajorareasofconcem,andmoreimponantly, we can 
find the appropriate solutions. 

". think we need to take a close look 81 academic expecta-
tions. Obviously that's not a concern 81 UCSD, bul our 
standards are very different than at a number of other insti-
tutions," she said. 

Perhaps Sweet's biggest goal is 10 set a precedent. 
"It's important for me to do a good job in my position," 

Sweet said. 
"[ have repeatedly said that being the first is just a matter 

of timing. The important thing is that I'm not the last. 
"I think that if I do the job that is necessary, and that I hope 

to do, I shouldn't be the last," she said.

LAWS 
Continued from page 1 
problems. 

The Lighting law is applie more 
to universities outside the UC sys-
tem, according to one UCSD Fa· 
cilities, Design and Con truction 
official_ It is up to the regents to 
adopt any portion of the law. 

It could rake months to choose 
any part of the law all UC policy, 
according to officials at UCSD's 
Department of Facilities, De ign. 
and Con truction. 

The third new law require a 
written uni versity policy guarantee-
ing counseling, confidentiali ty, and 
referral to other care centers for 
student , faculty, and staff who are 
victims of sexual assault. 

UCSD already offers free coun-
seling to students, according to Dr. 
John Giebinlc, director of Psycho-
logical/Counseling Services. 

"We now provide counseling for 
mpe victims as part of our job," he 
said. 

Psychological/Counseling Ser-
vices offers students as many coun-
seling session as they need for any 
problem free of charge. 

"Our job is to be there for people 
in trouble," Giebink said. 

Giebink e timates that between 
one and four rapes occur at UCSD 
each quarter. He added that an accu-

rate figure is difficult to gauge, since 
tudents often do not report the 

crime, even after the first few coun-
seling sessions. 

In cases of mpe, Giebink said, 
"The most imponant thing is to be 
there promptly" to ensure the best 
care for the victim. 

Psychological/Counseling Ser-
vices will al 0 see faculty and taff 
members on an emergency basis, 
according to Giebink.. 

According to Student Safety and 
Awareness Program (SSAP) Coor-
din8l0r Nancy Wahlig.the new law 
could "help colJeges acknowledge 
that problems ex.ist" 

Awareness through both the new 
mpe counseUng law and the crime 
tatistics law could reduce the in-

cidence of campus mpe . 
SSAP also offers a mpe preven-

tion program in the Student Cenrer 
and provides students wrinen infor-
mation for the prevention of mpe 
and for victims of sexual assault. 

The Faculty and Staff Assistance 
Program helps UCSD employees 
with counseling free of charge, but 
mainly refers them to erv ices in the 
corrununity. 

While UCSD has a written policy 
for exual assault included in a 
document covering other i ues, 
there is no policy document dealing 
solely with sexual assault. 

The fourth law, which requires 

The UCSD Guarwan 

more parking for disabled students, 
also passed last year. This law re-
quires the California State Univer-
sity system to open more free park-
ing paces for disabled students, 
employees, and visitors. 

Authors of the law will allow the 
regents to decide whether or not to 
adopt ponions of the disability law. 

According to Howard Finnecy. 
as i tant manager of Parking/ 
Tmnsponation Services, UCSD 
currently follows most of the guide-
lines set up by the law. 

Parking/Tran portation Services 
will have to change the policy to 
produce written audits regarding 
parking for the disabled. Finnecy 
said that coopemtion with Disabled 
Student Service should expe<liate 
compliance with the changes. 

UC 0 offers 24-hour free park-
ing in handicapped and metered 
spaces to anyone displaying a plac-
ard identifying the person as dis-
abled and to anyone providing 
transportation to disabled visi tors. 

According to Laura Olipps of 
Disabled Student Services, free 
parking for students with di abili-
ties is important because of the lim-
ited transportation options. 

There are few buse with lifts for 
the handicapped, and tho e lifts are 
often broken, according to Chipps. 

"People can't depend on buse ," 
~he said.

CALIFORNIA BUDGET WOES 

Students Will Pay the Price 
After a decade of relative pro perity, the new governor of 

California has relUmed from the kitcben and reponed that the 
cupboards are bare. Last week newly-inaugurated Governor 
Pete Wil on pre ented hi budget for the 1991-92 fi al year, 
and allis not well. Wilson reported in hi "Stale of the State" 
address that California is facing a $7 billion budget deficit -
nearly $5 billion more than last year - and that drastic 
measure, uch as tax and other fee increIlSe , as well as 
cutback in oClal programs and education, will be nece ary 
to make up for lost revenue. 

The UC and other lale-run college will be particularly 
hard hit. The new budget onl y allocates $2.189 bi II ion dollars 
to the UC, which I $2.1 million Ie ~ than what the UC was 
allocated tor the previous fiscal year. 

According to UC Pre!.ident DaVid Gardner's office, the 
2.2 mtllion dollar ~hortfall is really the equivalent of $295 

milltol1 when malOtenance and inflation arecalculatcd Into the 
equation. 

In any C3!.e, the UC IS 10 dire finan ial straights. and as IS 
a/ways the case, students will be forced to plcl.. up the multi-
million dollar tab in the fornl of higher fees. 

The governor's propo al to alleviate the deficit i an 
outrage. While balancing a budget is by no means clean or 
ea y, Wi! on hnsdonenothingshort than eViscerate an already 
feeble public school system . 

Accordmg to President Gardner, the governor' s budget , 
"when allowing for inflation and enrollment increases, has the 
effeci of reducing the UC' base budget by $176 million." 
According to Gardner, $176 million i about eight percent of 
the UC' operating budget, "the practical equivelent of the 
combined annual operating budgets of the Riverside and 

anta Cruz campuses." 
Wilson doesn't eern 10 see thiS as a problem. though. He 

has proposed to raise student fees by a taggering 20 percent. 
Thb tranlatcs to an increase of $325 per year for in-state 

~tudent~, !O a total of 1,949 a year. 
Out-of.state tudent can expect 10 pay $7.699. or about 

$1,200 more than what they are paying now. When y u add in 
miscellaneous fees, tn- tate tudents can expect to pay n little 
over $2,000 a year, while out-oF-state students will pay more 
than $10. 

What Wilson ha. apparently not considered i;, the legality 
of such a fee increase. According to the Universn of Calif or-
nia Students' Association (UCSA), the increase is a blatant 
violation of state law. 

According to the UCSA, Senate Bill 1645, "The Long 
Tenn Student Fee Policy," limits student fee increases to a 
maximum of I 0 percent per year. The pol icy, igned into law 
by Governor George Deukmejian four months before he left 
office, was intended to allow for fair fee increases without 
creating unnece sary hardships for students. A 20 pereent 
increase i not only unfair, but will be brutal on the wallets of 
low-income students. 

What is most painful aboUI Wilson 's budget proposal is his 
callous betrayal of a majority of his constituency. Wilson, 
similarto George Bu h, placed a heavy emphasis on education 
in his campaign, and like George Bush, Wilson has not lived 
up to his promise of a healthy public education system. 

The state is in a terrible financial fix , but economic revi-
talization should not come at the co t of the the quality of 
education of millions of California's young people - from 
kindergarten to COllege. State Schools Superintendent Bill 
Honig ex pres ed the feeling of many Californians when he 
said that no one wants to cripple economic reform. but. "I 
don't think a case has been made ... why $1 .4 billion should be 
taken from schools." 

Wilson's callous and ill-conceived decisions to take money 
from education and override state laws mandating a minimum 
budget allocation of 40 percent of the general fund toward 
education will cripple an already sickly public school system. 
A 20 percent fee increase, if unChallenged, i nothing short of 
extortion.

Tunnel 
VISIONS 
• Adventure in underground 
maze attracts some students 
By Aaron Cheesl11IIn 
Guardian Reporter 

A newcomer to a university is likely to hear all 
sons of myths and legends concerning the new 
environment. Perhaps one has heard a story about 
engineering students tapping into dorm phone lines, or 
what non-digestibles have been discovered in cafeteria 
salads. But almost without exception, UCSD students 
have heard of the "secret" tunnels that run under our 
schooL 

Some rumors tell of bodies stored underground, or 
lab experiments gone awry. A more plausible story 
details how the tunnels are safeguards in case of a 
student riot. According to UCSD Police Sergean t Jeff 
Hutchison, all these tales are equally untrue. Yet, 
curiosity about the tunnels persists. 

For some, the curiosi ty has gonen the bener of 
them, According to Fred Chukes, Physical Plant 
superintendent, although interest has died down over 
the past few years, students have been found in the 
tunnels exploring, wall-writing, or even playing 
Dungeons & Dragons. 

The tunnels can be intimidating for some students. 
Senior Bill Robison once went inside for a moment 
and quickly retreated . "r got freaked out," Robinson 
said, 

Randy Dotinga, a recent graduate of Muir College, 
was too curious to walk away, Although Dotinga 
explained that it was "scary as hell," as a wall writer 
(a person who writes poetry and other passages on the 
walls in various locations around UCSD), going into 
the tunnels and writing on the wall s was considered a 
"rite of passage." 

He had heard rumors that a tunnel led to the Basic 
Science Building (BSB) morgue, but locked gates 
kept him from finding the truth. 

For Dotinga, the trip through the tunnels was 
exciting because he felt like he was "getting away 
with something." 

The tunnels run across the campus, according to 
Third College Senior Greg Knauss. Knauss, who has 
wandered through them, said that the Central Library 
tunnel entrance leads to the Basic Scie nce Building, 
Another path heads to Peterson Hall which, in tum, 
goes to the Hump, with branches to the Muir Raths-
keller and Mandeville Auditorium. 

As to why he went, Knauss said, " It 's the quintes-
sential ' neat thing '. It 's part of the college tradition to 
go poking around where you're not supposed to." 

While for some, the tunnels are made for adven-
ture, according to Chukes, they were designed for just 
one purpose - maintenance. 

"They house numerous utility systems, such as .,. 
water pipes, heating, gas, and electric lines," he said. 

'The advantage to this sort of system is that it 
provides easy access for repair, " said Huchison, "The 
street doesn't have to be dug up to get at the systems." 

According to Hutchison, however, because of the 
mystique of the tunnels, students continue to sneak in. 

But one faces some serious risks upon taking a 
first step inside. The halls are filled with silent alarms 
which are easily tripped. If caught, one faces trespass-
ing charges as well as charges concerning student 
conduct. It is possible to be lticked out of school. 

The main reason for such a strict policy concerns 
the serious safety hazards in the tunnels. 

"It would be easy to get burned on the exposed 
heating pipes, or brealc a leg slipping off the metal 
rungs leading down into the tunnels," said UCSD

Sentimental Favorite 
• Rostend's 'Cyrano' remains a classic in film 
By Michael Schwartz 
Senior Staff Writer 

Classics are hitting the creen 
in a big way these days. While Mel 
"Thunderdome" Gibson tackles 
Hamlet, Gerard Depardieu is tak-
ing on Cyrano. Edmond Rosland ' s 
"Cyrano de Bergerac" is a senti -
memal favorite not only in France, 
but throughout the world. Dealing 
with the universal desire for love 
and - even more strongly - the 
emptine s of lost love, "Cyrano de 
Bergerac" is currently playing al 
the Cove Theatre in La 101la. 

The story is blatantly sentimen-
tal. Cyrano is ugly but has the gift 
of creating beautiful poetry at a 
moment' notice. Christian is 
beautiful but is talentle s speaking 
to women. And they're both in 
love with Roxanne , Cyrano's 
cousin. Cyrano feel she could not 
love him with his monstrous pro-
boscisand writes letters to Roxanne 
u ing Christian's name. She fall 
madly ~ r him - " him" being 
Cyrano's mind and Chri tian's 
look . Cyrano remains ~toic to the 
end. refusing to admit to Roxanne 
that it was he who loved her. Only 
the most callou viewer~ wouldn't 
empathize with the man who fceh 
that the women he loves would 
never love him back. 

Cyrano i one of the greate~t 
protagonists in the the:urical tra-
dition, and Gerard Depardieu is 
perfectly suited for the role. 
Lacking the conventionally hand-
ome looks pos es ed by most 

movie stars, Depardieu has always 
been able to perfonn a a romantic 
male lead because of his strong 
ensuality. 

With the chance todeliversome 
of the finest speeches in French 
theater ince Moliere makes the 
rol e an especia lly juicy one, 
Depardieu ends the portrayal on a 
richly defeated note. He makes it 
impossible not to feel orry for the 

man who was really being loved, 
as Roxanne truly loved the words 
and not the face. This is in strong 
contrast to Lhe English torchbearer 
of the role, Derek Jacobi, whose 
Cyrano dies victorious in his ac-
tions. This is nol a Mel Gibson! 
Hamlet scenario. RaLherthan a half-
rate actor doing a pretty good job, 
Depardieu is an exceptional actor 
doing a magnificent job. 

It is unfonunale that Director 
lean Paul Rapppeneau could nol 
achieve an equivalent level of 

" Sure, there's a little 
cinematic license and 
that annoying boy who 
keeps eyeing Cyrano 
through Act III. But 
compared to the highly 
customized and modi-
fied 'Hamlet' now on 
screen, this work is a 
xerox of the original 
text. " 

greatne~s. H i~ inadequate camero 
angles, pan ,and group hots only 
serve to diffuse focus away from 
the continuou~ 'ource of energy, 
Cyrano. The story is all about 
Cyrano and it would be nice to be 
given an occasional close-up of 
the character. Thi is not an en-
semble piece; the story is com-
pletely bu ilt around :l single man. 

The advantage of appearing on 
screen I ie in the grandeur. Seeing 
Cyrano fight hundred ofan:lckers 
and seeing hundreds at the theater 
react to him builds him up to the 
large proportions the he deserves. 
However. it is a double-edged 
sword and eventually work against 
the story. Cyrano i all about lan-
guageand the word, but Rappenau 

has put all Lhe focus on Lhe visuaJ, 
detracting from the spoken woro . 
In the dimly-lit balcony scene and 
final death scene, Lhe minimalist 
presentation shows why Cyrano 
will always be better in Lheconfine-
ments of the stage. 

Credit Lhe film with leaving Lhe 
oroerand action of the original play 
virtually untouched. Sure, there's a 
little cinematic license and Lhat 
annoying boy who keeps eyeing 
Cyrano through Act III. But com-
pared to Lhe highly customized and 
modified "Hamlet" now on screen, 
this work is a xerox of Lhe original 
text. 

The film's presenlation in 
French (Lhe play' s original lan-
guage), while beneficial to the 
film' authenticity, also has its lim-
iting aspects. Written in rhyming 
couplets, Lhe language of the play 
has a beauty that is unavoidably 
los t in translation, Hearing the 
spoken French preserved the origi-
nal grace of the language, while the 
subtitles provide comprehension; 
this i an excellent compromise. 
However, Lhe translation presented 
in the film has not made up its mind 
on what it wants to be. It is rna tly 
rhymed, but wanders in an out of 
the convention. In many cases, it 
doe not pre erve the eloquence 
that Cyrano possesses. Forexample, 
while more notable translations 
have Cyrano proudly declaring that 
" 1 am one who wears his elegance 
within!" we are presented wiLh the 
watered down " My greatness is 
interior." 

While not great cinema, this is 
still a great work of an. Depardieu, 
certainly admired for the quantity 
of his work, is now being admired 
solely on the greatness of his work. 
And the story of Monsieur de 
Bergerac is as moving now as when 
it was first presented in 1898. It is a 
work that both promotes excellence 
and covers up its mediocri ty.

'It's A Conspiracy. , •• 
• 'Hidden Agenda' thrills its audiences 
with its documentary-like depiction of 
political life in Belfast, Ireland 
By caitlin Woodthorpe 
Staff Writer 

Described by the Toronto Me-
tropolis as possibly "Lhe political film 
of the decade," "Hidden Agenda" is a 
taut political thriller dealing wiLh a 
highly controversiaJ subject. Director 
Ken Loach is well known in Britain for 
his hard-hitting, realistic documentary 
style in boLh film and television pro-
ductions. In "Hidden Agenda," he ap-
plies this techniqe 10 an investigation 
and ultimately damning indictment of 
British political and military actions in 
its province of Northern Ireland. 

Set in Belfast (Northern Ireland 's 
major city) in the early 1980s, the film 
portrays fo ur members of the Interna-
tional League for Civil Liberties who 
are in the province 10 preparing a repon 
on alleged brutality by the British Se-
curity Forces. 

On theirday of depanure one of the 
four, American lawyer Paul Sullivan 
(Brad Dourif), secretly goes to meet a 
man who claiming to have evidence 
against the British. They are both shot 
by the Security Forces, who later claim 
this was legitimate action against 
suspected terrorists. 

The murder of an American, how-
ever, sparks off a worldwide publicity 
bombshell, which results in theBritish 
government appointing a top police 
investigator, Peter Kerrigan (Brian 
Cox), to report on the case. 

In the face of great hostility from 
the Security Forces and the R.U.C., 
the British-run police force in Nonh-
em Ireland, Kerrigan and Sullivan's 

fianc~ Ingrid (Frances McDormand) 
join together to try and uncover the 
real truth about Paul's death. Their 
search takes Lhem into the dangerous 
world of the Belfast Republican 
movement and they uncover evidence 
of huge abuses of power by the British

Intelligence Service and political 
wrongdoings by the Conservative 
government on par with Watergate. 

It seems the British military in 
Northern Ireland are answerable to no 
one, operating on a shoot-to-kill policy, 
and that Margaret Thatcher's Conser-
vative government came to power as a 
direct result of British Intelligence's 
efforts to bring down the previous So-
cialist government. 

"Hidden Agenda" is first and fore-
most a cracking good political thriller. 
In the film, it seems that no one can 
really be trus ted and that everyone is 
spying on everyone else. The tension 
of never knowing when the R.U.C. 
might break down the front door and 
take suspects away for questioning -
and of being under continual security 

" Loach's documentary 
style works extremely 
well and the authenticity 
of its portrayal of life in 
Belfast is remarkable. 
This is gritty harsh real-

over Ingrid and Kerrigan, as it does for

intrusive.

Francis McDormand as Ingrid uncovers a political conspiracy when she 
investigates her fiance 's murder in "Hidden Agenda." 
markable. This i gritty harsh reali m 
which makes no attempt to play down 
Lhe horror of life in Northern Ireland. 
Actual live footage of pro-Briti h 
marche and British oldiers on the 
streets of Belfast is used, and there 's 
also a host of interesting perfonnances 
from local Belfast citizens, brought in 
by Loach to help authenti cate the film . 
Their narrations of police raids, mur-
der of unarmed su pects and brutality 
by Britih security forces, are uccess-
fully woven imo the fabric of the film. 

The central performances of Cox 
and McDormand - who was nomi-
nated for an Oscar for her portrayal of 
the sheri ff' s wife in " Miss issipp i 
BumlOg" - are both solid and enter-
taining. Cox evokes much sympathy 
as a police investigator facing impos-
ible opposition and hostility from the 

R.U.C. and the British Intelligence 
Services. 

Unfortu nately, the econd half of 
"Hidden Agenda" flounders somewhat 
as its plausibility wanes. Characters 
take risks that seem highl y improbable. 
Their actions may fit the mechanics of 
the plot, but in a film so heavily based 
on real life, it 's hard to overlook some 
of these inconsistencies. The conclu-
sion, however, leaves the audience in 
suspense, to make up its own mind 
about the results of the investigation 

into Paul 's death. 
Politically, the film is dynanlite -

it caused a raging controversy among 
Briti h journalists at the 1990 Cannes 
Film Festival where it won the Special 
Jury Prize, while questions have been 
asked about it in the British Parlia-
ment. It does give a very sympathetic 
portrayal of the Irish Repub lican 
movement and to the "freedom fight-
ers" of the I.R .A., with only a small 
effort made to jUMify the Britbh pres-
ence in the province as an effort to 
control I .R.A. terrorism and prevent a 
civil war. 

Whatever its political message or 
the reliability of its allegations, "Hid-
den Agenda" i a good political thriller 
which packs a lot of punches. It is at 
its best, however, as a portrayal on a 
basic human level of the problems in 
Northern Ireland . Families , both 
Catholic and Protestant, are torn apart 
by murder, and all live in degrees of 
poverty and hardship because Ihe 
troubles have destroyed Northern Ire-
land on an economic as well as a 
socia-political basis. 

As Loach depicts, violence by ei-
ther the British or the I.R.A. will not 
solve the problems of Belfast or fi-
nally give Ireland peace after eight 
hundred years of English involement 
in its affairs.

W.HOOP 
Continued from page 20 
pregame promise of a strong in-
side offense. Young led the team 
with 23 points and 10 rebounds. 

Beaver shot under 50 percent 
from the floor, but still racked up a 
respectable eight points and six 
rebounds againsl the Cougars. 

Early in the game, the Tritons 
were caught slightly off guard. 

"We didn't anlicipate Ih early 
press," Malone said. "But our of-
fense swilched withoul a hitch." 

In facl, the switch couldn't have 
been smoother. Aftcrthreeminutes 
of embarrassing fast breaks. the 
Cougars finally dropped back. 

The Tritons held a comfortable 
lead at the half (35-27), and pUllhe 
game on ice midway through the 
second half, opening up leads as 
large as 22 points. 

Riding high from the viclory 
over the Cougars. the Tritons de· 
scended upon the Point Lorna 
Crusaders with a holy vengeance. 

Early in the game, the tradi-
tional rivals traded blow with nei-
ther team taking a big lead. 

Unfortunately, UCSD fell vic-
tim to a siring of turnovers and fast 

SPORTS 15 

breaks. By halftime. PLNC had a 
temporary four-point lead, 27-23. 

1betideeventually turned when 
the Tritons were able to return to 
their inside game. The key moment 
came when Young sunk a lay-up 
and drew a foul. She canned the 
free Ihrow to complele the three· 
point play and gave the Tritons a 
46-45 lead with three minules to 
play. 

Once UCSD wrested the lead 
away, PLNC neve. took it back. 

The Crusaders. however, did 
come close. They tied it up twice 
more before Molly JOlJ1I' , sewed 
up the game with UCSIYs only 
three-pointer. 

Again, Young dominated the 
boards and the scoring, banging 
home 20 points and 13 rebounds. 

Beaver looked smoother on the 
boards, but still only sunk 6 for 14, 
garnering a solid 13 points. 

"We have a little problem meet-
ing tough defense." Malone said. 
"We tend to back down when we 
should mount a lougher offense." 

"[PLNC has] three six-footers 
down low," Malone said_ "Butthey 
don't post very well. Our biggest 
problem was wilh their agility and 
quick hands."

~ THE WEEK IN SPORTS/JANUARY 7·13 M. SWIM Continued from page 20 the 1,000- and 500-yard frees tyle events. Jeff 
Vance also won his event, taking the 1000yard 
butterfly in 53.79 seconds. 

SEASON RECORDS ; NOTES UPCOMING EVENTS It seemed somewhat appropriate that UCSD 
opened its season of dual meets with Claremont. 
The rivalry's history includes a one point UCSD 
loss for second place in the 1988 National meet. 
Since then, however, UCSD has won each time, 
but the competition remains fierce. Fourth-year 
swimmer Mike Roberts said, "There's no doubt 
we've focused on this more than any other meet to 
date."

The coaches feel that the results of training and 
competition are interrelated. It took those nine 
workouts to bring about Friday night' s successful 
results. Swenson insisted that a team cannot per-
fonn well without proper work in both workouts 
and competition. 

"If [the meet] was last week, we might have 
lost," Boyd said.

six [points] the entire game and we only pulled 
away at the very end of the game." 

Marshall felt that one of the keys to the Tritons ' 
fourth road victory of the season was a strong 
perimeter defense that limited Pomona's backcourt 
scoring to just 24 points. 

"We've really worked hard in practice recently 
on our perimeter defense, and it showed against 
Pomona," Marshall said. 

Marshall was particularly pleased with the 
perfonnance of his bench players. especially 
freshman backup point guard Rodney Lusain and 
reserve forward John Spence. 

"[Lusain and Spence] really gave us good 
minutes and Rodney really came in and did the job 
at point for us," Marshall said. , 

Marshall was also very happy with the per-
fonnance turned in by junior forward-center Rick 
Batt, who scored 19 points on eight-of- II shooting 
from the floor while pulling down a team-high six 
rebounds. 

Senior Tim Rapp, the team 's leading scorer, 
had somewhat of an "off game defensively" ac-
cording to Marshall , but still managed to tie Batt 
for team-high honors in both scoring and re-
bounding with 19 points and six boards.

Milkbones, Vrtale, 
And Nose Tackles 

J UST A FEW NOTES: • It seem a though not everyone learn from 
their mistakes. For year, when 
Pat Riley wa coaching the Los 
Angele Lakers, writers and 
analysts refu ed to acknowledge 
hi superior coaching ability . 

Instead, they pointed to the 
incredible talent surrounding 
him. and directed their attention 
to coache of fla h-in-the-pan 
teams - quad which burned 
brightly one year and fizzled the 
next. Now Riley ha left, and it is 
clear that the Laker are no 
longer the same team they on e 
were. 

Well , those writers and 
analy ts are making the ame 
mi take all over again with an 
Francisco 4ger Head Coach 
George Seifert . Coach of the 
Year andidate include every-
one from Don Shula to Art Shell 
to Mike Ditka, but no one ha 0 
much as mouthed Seifert 's name. 

W HEN Bill Walsh left, many people (myself included) 
fully expected the 4gers to go 
right into the dumper. But it 
hasn't happened. If anything, the 
tearn is playing better under 
Seifert than it ever did under 
Walsh. 

History has shown that 
maintaining a winning team i no 
easy task, yet under Seifert, 
winning seems anything but 
hard. 

• One of the more entertaining 
sights this past weekend was 
watching 320-pound 4ger nose 
tackle Michael Carter complete 
the first 6 I-yard touchdown run 
in NFL history by a man with no 
knees. 

At least, it looked that way. 
The funniest and most 

thought-provoking part of the run 
was that none of the Redskins -
wide receivers and running backs 
included - could catch him. 

Wow, does Washington need 
to work on team speed. 

T HE nuttiest sight of the weekend occurred at Rich 
Stadium in Buffalo, where the 
Dolphins and the Bills waged 
battle in a nowstorm. A game 
with that much now just was not 
meant to be played on artificial 
turf. 

You just have to have people 
rolling around, soaking wet, in 
dirt-<:overed jersie to get the full 
effect. 

Wonderful for the players too.

Claremont College

When the waves stopped and 
the waters calmed, UCSD left 
Claremont College standing on the 
edge of the UCSD Natatorium 
wondering what great sea god it 
had just encountered.

Women's 
Hoop Streak 
Reaches Four 
By Andy Gayton 
Staff Writer 

Someone's been sharpening the Tritons' 
tridents, if the women's basketball team's 
winning streak is any indication. 

Thursday night, the Tritons skewered Azusa 
Pacific, 67-48. Unsatisfied, UCSD then 
trounced Point Lorna Saturday night, 61-55. 

Bluntly speaking, this is shocking. Is this 
the same team that was dealt a crushing 31-
point loss by Point Loma earlier this season? 

Moreover, UCSD was 11-14 against the 
Crusaders and had not won in the teams' last 
three meetings. Meanwhile, Azusa Pacific had 
held the Tritons to four wins in 13 games. 

With the two victories, UCSD boosted its 
record to 10-4, and increased its winning streak 
to four. 

From tip-off to the final buzzer, the Tritons 
held Azusa Pacific at bay, relinquishing the 
lead only once late in the ftest half. 

defeated the Stag , 135-106, in 
UCSD's first dual meet of the sea-
on. 

UCSD started fast with a 1.89 
econd victory in the 400-yard 

medley relay and proceeded to 
place first in seven of the II events. 

Relaxed and confident, the Tri-
tons led the entire way with only a 
slight hint of trouble when Brian 
Link was disqualified in the 400-
yard individual medley and lost 
what would have been a second-
place finish worth six points. 

First-year Head Coach Doug 
Boyd made note of the especially 
good performances oflohn Hower 
and Kevin Vance.

Later, in the IOO-yard freestyle,

seconds, edging out teammate 
Hower who consequently took 
second.

highly-touted freshman Travis 
Miller in the l00-yard backstroke.

Tritons 
Pluck the 
Sagehens 
• Bench, Batt tum in 
strong performances 
By L .. Bruvold 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team traveled to Pomona-Pitzer 
Friday where it defeated a pesky 
Sagehen squad 68-55, improving 
the Tritons' record to 12-3. 

One might have predicted that 
the Tritons would have an easy 
time with Pomona, considering that 
UCSD walloped the Sagehens by 
more than 20 points just two weeks 
ago at the La loUa Classic. 

But, according to UCSD Head 
Coach Tom Marshall, Friday 
night's contest was far from a 
blowout

than the score indicated. .. MarshaIl
