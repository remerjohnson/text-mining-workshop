Prop 13 expected winner 
by Mark Stadler 

Senior Editor 
With over 20 percent of the sta tewide 

vote tallied early this morning, 
Proposition 13, the Jarvis-Gann 
property tax limitation measure, was 
being approved by 62 percent of the 
voters. 

Meanwhile, State Attorney General 
Evelle Younger had opened up a ten 
percent margin over former Los 
Angeles police chief Ed Davis for the 
Republican Party 's guberaatorial 
nomination. 

The lure of Prop 13, which would 
limit property tax assessments to one 
percent of a building's market value, 
brought an expected huge number of 
voters to the polls yesterday. While 
final turnout figures were not 
available, county. voter registrars 
were predicting a record turnout for a 
non-presidential primary election. 

Republican gubernatorial race were 
state Assemblyman Ken Maddy with 
20 percent and San Diego Mayor Pete 
Wilson with 9 percent. 

The eventual winner in the 
Republican primary will face Gov. 
Brown, who fought off challenges from 
eight candidates to take 82 percent in 
the Democratic primary. 

68 to 32 percent margin . In the 
Republican primary, D. French was 
winning with 75 percent. 

In the Democratic race for State 
Attorney General, Congresswoman 
Yvonne Braithwaite Burke had a very 
narrow margin over Los Angeles City

Poetry 
co llection 

by Louis Pearl 
Stafr Writer 

Here Ye, Hear Yeo 
The poets are about to speak. 
Anyone interested in what 

modern poets have to 'say may 
make use of the Archive for 
New Poetry. Located on the 
eighth floor of the Central 
Library, the archive, together 
with the regular library 
collection, represents the fifth 
largest collection of new poetry 
in the country today and is the 
most widely used section of the 
tlCSD library's special collec-
tIOns. 
. Started over ten years ago by 

Itterature professor Roy 
Harvey Pearce, the archive is 
an attempt to collect all poetry 
published in the English 
language since World War II . 
Through various small press 
bookstores throughout the 
country, the archive now 
obtains every publication of 
every small press (Black 
Sparrow, Perishable Press, 
Sand Dollar, etc.) and every 
poetry magazine (Wild Dog. 
Open Space, The Fifties, etc.) 
that publishes new poetry in the 
English language. In addition 
to the literature, the archive 
contains records and over 420 
pho~otapes of poetry readings. 

Nme UCSD faculty members 
are represented in the archive. 
1 hey are: David and Eleanor 
Antin, Jerome Rothenberg, 
Sherely William, Wai Lim Yip, 
Bram Dljkstra, Donald Wes-
ling, Allen Kaprow and Michael 
Davidson, who is the Director 
of the Archive. 

Funds for the purchase of 
archive books come from the 
General Literature Fund. For 
special purchases, sing le 
author collections and limited 
editions, funds are obtained 
from the Friends of the 
Library, as well as from 
individual patrons and litera-
ture grant sources. 

Seven authors 
S ven single author files are 

included In the Archive. The 
purpo e of these files is to 
record a poet' entire work 
from manu criPt copy to final

While Prop 13 was gaining 
overwhelming support, Proposition 8, 
which would put into effect the state 
Legislature's alternative to Jarvis-
Gann, was being approved by a 
narrow 52 to 48 margin. 

In the Republican Lieutenant 
Governor primary, Mike Curb, with51 
percent was persued closely by Mike 
Antonovich , with 49 percent. The 
winner will face democratic 
encumbent Lt. Gov. Mervin Dymally 
who won e a s il y 0 v.e r s eve r a 1 
challengers. 

Democratic incumbent Secretary of 
State March Fong Eu who ran 
unopposed in the primary, will face J . 
Margosian, who won the Republican 
primary against two other candidates. If Prop 13 is approved, as even its 

most bitter detracters have conceded, 
it will become the target for numerous 
legal challenges. The first of these is 
set to come this morning when 
attornies for several Northern 
California school districts file suit with 
the state Supreme Court questioning 
the initiative's constitutionality. 

In the two State Controller 
primaries incumbent Democrat Ken 
Cory won with 75 percent and 
Republicans Dixon Arnett and J . Ware 
were within 5 percent of each other as 
of one o'clock this morning.

Armitage holds unusual views 
New VCSA prefers student control of their funds 

by Dave Eisen 
Richard Armitage, now in 

his first full week as UCSD's 
Vice-chancellor and Dean of 
Student Affairs, tends to 
strike university observors as 
being somewhat unusual. 

He is order (60- years old) , 
taller (6'8") and seems to hold 
views strikingly different 
from those of other adminis-
trators. 

"It's the students' money," 
he says of Registration Fee 
funds over which students 
now have just advisory power. 
"If we can ascertain what a 
majority of students want, I 
see no reason why administra-
tors should stand in their 
way." 

Sitting in his office in the 
southwest corner of the 

Student Center, Armitage 
already looks at home. He 
admits, however, that he is 
not. 

"Lot to learn" 
"I have a lot to learn here. 

I'll spend the next few weeks 
learning all of the necessary 
details. Really , I have to 
caution you about all of my 
opinions so far. I'm not 
completely sure how every-
thing works." 

Armitage's view regarding 
student control of its own 
funds might change, then as 
he says, "I'm not even sure 
about the structure of the reg 
fee committee." 

Both his looks and philoso-
phies belie Armitage's age. 
He looks no older than 40, and 
is philosophically oriented 

toward change. 
" I get my kicks from 

making things change and 
grow. I came here because 
UCSD is something that ' s 
growing and becom ing, 
rather th~h something that' 
already made. 

"For that reason, I'd rather 
be here than Berkeley or 
UCLA." 

UCSD's newest administra-
tor has spent most of his adult 
life at Ohio State, where he 
earned his PhD in Romance 
Languages. After becoming a 
tenured professor, he took 
roles as a co-chair of oreinta-
tion programs , Assistant 
Dean and Dean of the Grad-
uate School, campus ombuds-
man and Vice-president of 
Student Services. 

Mixed in was one year as a 
Dean at the University of 
Missouri. 

"My favorite job was as 
ombudsman," he recalls . 
"We were dealing with the 
aftermath of student unrest in 
the late sixties and early 
seventies and 90 percent of my 
time was taken up talking 
with students." 

If he had not received the 
UCSD job, Armitage says, he 
would have gone back to being 
a fultime professor. "Except 
for this year, I' ve taught ome 
classes every year since I got 
my PhD." \ 

Offered the Vice-chancellor 
post in December, "it took mx 
less than 24 hours to accept. '

He says that' 'many people 
outside of academics don't 
realize how good this institu-
tion is. Faculty at Ohio State 
understood my decision to 
come here , but student 
would ask, 'Where are you

"No fri lis" 
rec center 

by Laura A. Richler 
News Editor 

The final report by the 
Recreation and Athletic Long 
Range Planning Committee 
released last week recom-
mends a " no frills" addition tc 
present athletic facilities , 
mcluding a 25 meter by 25 yard 
swimming pool, handball and 
racquetball courts , tennis 
courts and a gym. 

The proposed site for the new 
recreational facilitie~ is east of 

. Central Library , north of 
Miramar Raod and adjacent to 
the new recreation field , 
currently under construction. 

In financing the project, the 
committee recommends that a 
figure of $2.5 million net be 
exceeded, and that funding be 
derived from a $1.5 million 
Regents' loan to be guarant~ 
by an $8 per quarter speCIal 
student fee and $1 million 10 gift 
funds. A gift fund drive would, 
under the committee's plan, 
begin Winter quarter, 1979. 

Anten Witte , Director of 
Capital Budget and Space 
Management and member of 
the planning committee , 
commented that, " On all the 
committee I've served on here 
at UCSD, thi i the only one 
that has really evolved . 
Usually, members know what

Thb other "holoca.ust" 
Open Letter: 

Many people bave watched tbe recent television production of the Holocaust, a 
fictionalized version of the slaughter of the Jews durine World War II as told from the point 
of view of a Jewisb family. And if those who watched are like myself, they reacted with 
shame and horror and dlslUSt. The ruthless murder of 14 million human beings is a shocking 
event, an event so shocking that even watching the cleaned·up, dressed·up fictionalized 
version one could not help but be affected. . 

But I wonder how manv of those who watched remembered that the Jews were not the only 
group marked for "special handling" by the German SS - (:uocentration camps, 
starVation, torture, and eventual murder by hydrogen cyanide poisonine. There is one 
grouD whose deaths are estimated at half a million - thP. exact number will never be known 
- and the murder of the members of this group was not condemned at the Nuremberg trials 
because the Allied powers, including the US, condoned their mass executions. Jo'or this 
group the Holocaust has not ended even today. 

Like the Jews, this group has existed at least since the lime orthe Old Testament. Like the 
Jews, the basis for their persecution is essentially a religious one. And, also like the Jews, 
the religious persecution of this group has not ended. 

Who were these half a million people, and why have the records of their deaths been 
ignored and forgotten, to be only just recently brought to light again? 

The group I am speaking of are the homosexuals, a group to which the " man on the street" 
reacts to at best with ignorance and indifference, at worst with ignorance and bigotry, 
hatred and revulsion. Tbe rights of homosexuals are not recognized in any country of the 
world including the US; the number of cities in the US that do recognize homosexuals' huma~ rights are rapidly vanishing, thanks to the recent elections in Miami, St. Paul , 
Wichita and Eugene.

This fall California voters will decide upon an initiative which deals with the right of 
teachers to speak ahout homosexuality anywhere, at any time. It states: " (This initiative) 
provides for filing charges against school teachers, teacher's aides , school administrators, 
or counselors for advocating, soliciting, imposing, encouraging or promoting private or 
public sexual acts defined in Sections 286 (a) and 288a (a) of the Penal Code between persons 
of the same sex in a mannt:r likely to come to the attention of other employees or students; or 
publicly and indescreetly engaging in said acts . Prohj~its hiring a.nd requires dis!1lissa~ of 
such persons if school board determines them unfit for service after conSlder~ting 
enumerated guidelines. In dismissal ca~s only, provides fo~ two-s':llge heanngs, written 
infindings judicial review." According to Its sponsor, John Bnggs, thIS proposed law IS both reasonabl~ and necessary; reasonable, because he knows that most people believe. as he 
does that homosexuality is immoral; and necessary, becau e he feels that schoolchIldren 
must be kept from hearing verbal support of homosexuality as an alternative lifestyle. 

I am both shocked and dismayed by this initiative. The proposed law is clearly 
unconstitutional, as it violates the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech a~d 
freedom of religion ' it is also completely contrary to the trditions orfreedom as expressed m 
the Declaration oC ' Independence. Any word. any phrase said anywhere , not just in the 
classroom. by any certified teacher or teacher's aide or any ot~er school emplo>:ee, which 
conld be considered either a statement of one's own homosexualIty or a statement m support 
of the right of others to live a homosexual life tyle, would be considered sufficient grounds 
for charges to be brought and for that teacher to be removed from the classroom. It is lear 
to me that what is being attacked here are not just the rights of homosexuals. but the right of

anyone , heterosexual or homosexual , to speak freely anywhere. . . 
Homosexuals are denied their rights because they are conSIdered Immoral. But smce the 

belief that they are immoral is based on religious morality, making such a belief law 
violates the First Amendment's right to freedom of religion. I have no right to force my 
religious beliefs upon others by law; neither should Anita Bryant and John Briggs. 

An ominous trend is in the air. When Mark 
Stadler graduates Crom UCSD, he might not 
have any taxpayers to tax, any businesses to 
regulate, any minorities to patronize, and 
even beCore his graduation. he might not get 
enough loot (known in polite SOCiety as tax 
revenue) to finish his education. For this is 
what the " right to education" amounts to: 
the Legislature's goons tell X to fork over Y 
dollars so that Z gets a " free " education. 
Why should anyone believe in such a right? 

The candidates also attract Stadler'S 
attention. The Republicans will nominate a 
rightist and lose. This trivial point can't be 
the real theme of the whole first third of an 
important article. It is actually an attempt at 
self·fulfilling prophecy. an attempt to grant 
in advance Stadler's most fervent prayer (if 
he indulges in such a reactionary pasttime) : 
that Ed Davis never become Governor of 
California . Stadler is scared to death that a 
media campaign will expose Brown 's views 
to people who are somewhat more rational 
than Triton Times ' editors and liberal 
Republicans. and make Davis Governor. 

Tbe rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are inaliena~le, says the 
Declaration of Independence, endowed upon us by our Creator. But do these rights apply to 
aU of us or just all of us except the homosexuals? 

Because I a heterosexual. am willing to speak out in defense of human rights , if this 
initiative becomes law I will not be allowed to teach. Is this the paradise of moral justice

Every initiative vote Stadler complains

UFW seeks benefits of mechanization 

Salinas, CA - The United Farm Workers union , which was expected to launch a major organizing drive this year, has 
instead found itself in 

another battle for sheer survi val. 
The union is threatened by 

isolation as a single-state labor 
group, facing disaster on two sides. 
In California the introduction of 
harvesting machines may wipe out 
half of all farm labor jobs in the 
state by 1985. Only 15 percent of 
California's farm workers are 
c urrently covered by contracts 
with the UFW (another 15 percent 
are negotiating contracts), and the 
fight over mechnization is diverting 
resources that the UFW had 
planned to use in organizing efforts . 

On the other side, the UFW is 
faced with increasing numbers of 
unorganized workers forced to 
migrate from the pervasive 
economic difficulties (and recent 
floods) in Mexi.::o. The union has 
nevereffectivel:r developed ways of 
organizing " ilIe ~al" Mexican farm 
workers who rr alte up more than 
half of the fam . labor force in the 
Southwest and I~ lorida . 

This articl waf written by Doug 
Fo ter, a repof"'e ~ for 'he Salinas 
Californian. 

Ironically. th.: batlle for union 
survival comes at a time when the 
UFW can point tQ concrete, long· 
term benefit s won for farm 
workers, especially in the SlIlinas 
Valley, the "salad bowl" of the 
nation. Wages for I ttuce workers. 
for example. hav multipli d 
several·fold since the hi stori c 
strike led by the FW here in 1970 
and 1971. 

Th hated ystem of contract 
Illbor has be n wiped out . replaced 
by a union hLring hall. " Whcn I 
started out in f..rm work . it wa 

very bad ," recalled an elderly 
Chicano who . like most [arm 
workers , still nurtures a fear of 
being identified in the press. "We 
had only piece rates, and every· 
thing was through the labor 
contracts. He decided everything. 
We didn 't know about politics and 
about laws which were supposed to 
protect us . After striklDg , and 
bringing the union in. we learned 
about those things . Now we ~ork 
under a contract, through the hiring 
hall. We havea say in what happens 
to us ." 

Part of what has happened to 
farm workers since union recogni· 
tion is that jobs guaranteed by legal 
protections , at a liveable wage, 
have led many Salinas workers out 
of the migrant stream into a stable 
life in their communities. 

However, this dream of security 
as non· migrants, which has become 
the backdrop of UFW organizing, is 
under the gun in Salinas. Lettuce is 
the financial backbone of agricul· 
ture in the state. even more 
lucrative than tomato production, 
and California alone provides well 
over 60 percent of the nation's 
lettuce upply . If California's 
lettuce growers were to turn to a 
mechanical harvester, the promise 
of non·migratory farm labor would 
di olve for about 13,500 farm 
workers ~Tlrl Lhl'ir families. 

Currently , lettuce growers -
including the corporate Interhar-
vest farms - are not inclined to 
shift to a mechanical harvester. 
L a bor relations have been 
reilltively smooth and there would 
be no financill l advllntage, at this 
stage. in making the shift. Besides. 
there are tec hnical difficulties: 
re earcher have yet to develop a 
mac hin tll d l supplie-s " fi ld · 
wrapped" Il'ttu e fficienl1y. and 
that is the preferred pa c king 
m thod. 

But the ni ve rsity of 1Ilifornia 
an d th e ' S Depurtm nt of 
Agriculture r main hurd at work to 
provld t hOI 1I1 br lI kthrough in 
fi Id·wrap~lIng . Over $720.000 ha 

been spent at the Salinas Resea rch 
Station to perfect the harvester. 

Lettuce workers have only to look 
over their shoulders to predict their 
future once the harvest is 
mechanized. When cotton was 
mechanized in California nearly 30 
years ago almost 100,000 jobs were 
wiped out and a generation of 
welfare families was created. And 
more recently, when the tomato 
harvester (developed at the 
University of California at Davis) 
took hold in the late 1960s and early 
1970s, many workers in tomato-rich 
Yolo County were stranded in farm 
communities and nearby citles, 
unable to earn enough money to 
move on. , 

Some of the workers found local 
jobs - in gas stations. stores or 
restaurants - but the number of jobs on the bottom rung of the 
employment ladder is limited, with 
stiff competition from teenagers 
and women. The vast majority of 
farm workers displaced by 
mechanization will have to attempt 
to reenter a stream of migratQry 
workers that is already swoll n to 
the point of bursting. 

In the right over mechanization . 
UFW President~~havez has 
zeroed in on the -f public funds 
by the University of California in 
developing ag ricultural machines. 
" It is intolerable". he has aid , 
" tha t the university u s tax money 
to do re earch thllt benefit only the 
few. Mechanization must benem 
everyone, not just the growers. " 

The UFW !Jas propo ed legi la· 
lion in luding a bill to tllX farm 
equipment li nd fund projects to aid 
displaced workers . So far , the state 
legi lature h u kill ed such 
propo als In committee. 

Chavez recently telegrammeti 
Gov . Jerry Brown to usk tnat a 
committee determine the impact of

that a lleges that there will be

" We ' rr not ~fI\"inp ' .. ·· re a lllnst

an aide to Chavez. said ..... . We 
don' t bemoan the technology; all 

- we want is for some of this 
wonderful technology to be used to 
help those who are hurt by it now." 

Brown has not responded to 
Chavez's plea and it is possible , in 
this election year, that he will take a 
hands·off approach to farm worker 
problems. 

The University of California has 
also resisted Chavez's call to study 
the social effect of its mechaniza· 
tion research . During a Board of 
Regents hearing in May . J .B . 
Kendrick Jr.. vice-president for 
agriculture, announced , " The 
university is an agent of change in 
terms of discovery of new 
knowledge and in the analysis of 
public i sues ... .It does not decide 
public policy or compensate losers 
among conflicting societal 
interests .. , 

When he heard a translation of 
Kendrick's remark, a young lettuce 
worker remarked. " They want to 
treat us like pieces of fruit. Once 
you squeeze the orange dry, you 
throw it away. But what will we do 
once we 've been thrown away? 
Where ca n we go?" 

There are rumblings within the 
UFW that havez and other union 
leaders have not done enough in the 
battle over mechanization. Some 
workers openly que tion union 
policy and tactic .

Wa tso nville aid. " The union

Johnson. a social worker at the 
Farm Worker Service in Woodland. 
Many of these families have had to 
turn to welfare . a prospect 
unwelcome in Salinas . 

Stranded families have check· 
ered the map of farming communi· 
ties across the United States this 
harvest season . But growers , given 
a choice, have been using Single 
male farm workers. and that has 
exacerbated the pressure of 
mechanization on farm workers .. 
Single male illegals are generally 
younger. more adventurous and 
easire to get rid of when the picking 
is over. The UFW also has had less 
success in orgllnizing single 
migrants than those with families 
who drellm of 'ettling down .

who lost in his bid for the

" It was well known at Ohio

It didn ' t matter iI I was in a

has been set for the 1981-82 
academic year. 

lfthe plan is adopted, a Board 
of Governors or Advisory 
Committee with student control 
Cor the new center would be 
appointed by the respective 
student organizations and the 
Chancellor. 

The board would be com-
pri ed of eight students (two 
representating the A~UCSD, 
one from each 01 l he four 
co lleges and two from the 
Graduate Student Council, all 
as voting member). the Vice-
chancellor of Student Affair .

consultants from the various

non-voting project director who 
would serve as secretary. 

Under the plan , board 
members would also serve on 
the Building Advisory Commit-
tee during the project planning 
stages and through its design 
ana construction. 

U{)on completion of the 
proJect , the board would 
determIne the operating 
policies of the facilities 
establish any fees relating to 
the use of the center and 
compile an annual report which 
outlines usage and operation of 
the faciliti s . 

Operating re pon ibility for

Archive. Reznikoff is associ-
ated with the "Objectionist" 
movement of the 1930s. 
Working as a lawyer and legal 
writer for most of his life, 
Reznikoff also wrote many long 
historical poems reflecting an 
interest in personal narrative, 
often ' taken from court testi-
mony. Many of these works 
touch on the experience of 
Jewish immigrants in New 
York in the first quarter of the 

~th century . The archive 
includes transcripts and 
notebooks in which the details 
of these long poerrtS" were first 
recorded. 

He says he is meeting with 
representatives of the 
Associated Students govern-
ment, and is being briefed on 
issues such as day care and 
reg fee-funded abortion. " I 
can't speak about them 
intelligently until I know all 
the facts." 

Armitage says he has 
received no special instruc-
tions from Chancellor Mc-
Elroy. " In fact, I've barely 
talked to him at all ." 

Atmitage considers himself 
a " fiscal conservative" and 
realizes that "you can't try to 
make everyone happy. That's 
a basic rule for decision-
making." 

On the subject of student 
needs and requests, Armitage 
says, " It 's very difficult to 
assess the real wants of 
students because there are 
so many pressure groups who 
say they represent the will of 
the students . 

Armitage appears at east: 
talking about how he deals 
with students. 

"I have to make my access-
ability clear to everyone. I 
have to make sure thatI'm not 
insulated by too many layers 
bP.tween me and the services 

" You have to get as many 
P.,Oints of view as possible, and 
If it's clear that a majority of 
the students want a certain 
thing, they can be syre that 
they won ' t get too much 
resistance from me." 

A major portion of the 
archive's actIvities consist of 
sponsoring a poetry reading 
series on Wednesday after-
noons in the Revelle Formal 
Lounge. This series has in past 
featured John Ashbery, 
Michael Palmer , Robert 
Creely, Robert Duncan, George 
Oppen, Adrianne Rich, Carl 
Rakosi , Jackson MacLow, 
David Antin, Susan Griffin and 
Michael McClure, to name a 
few. An open reading will be 
held on Wednesday, June 7 for <, 
anyone wishing to read.

A portrait of the wealth ri 
by Tim Mackenzie 

Arts Editor 
True, the creators of The Greek Tycoon never come right out 

and tell the audience, but everyone and his brother knows this Citm 
would have been entitled Ari & Jackie if there wasn't a delicate 
legal matter called libel. With the exception of a few real·life 
technicalities (Ii~e the terms o~ the supposed marriage contract) , 
however, there IS really nothmg for Jackie and her lawyers to 
concern themselves with . Indeed, 1 found Tycoon to be a richly 
detailed romantic saga, flattering in its portrayals of the late 

Gre~k shipping magnate and the one·time First Lady who became 
his wife. 

It's not easy to get a film like Tycoon to work, given the public 's 
near·morbld fascination and knowledge of the subject matter. 
Everyone has some conception of what Ari & Jackie were like. 1 
half expected this film to be like Gable & Lombard ; kind of schlocky 
with a dash of unmitigated sensationalism. The basic challenge of 
Gable & Lombard holds true for The Greek Tycoon: how to 
adequately portray people that were genuine legends in their own 
time while at the same time making an entertaining film that 
doesn 't overplay it's hand. 

Tycoon is a tastefully done film . benefitting from an obviously 
large budget and some real top·notch acting. No television co· 
stars here . Sorry, but James Brolin with pegged ears and pencil 
moustache just doesn 't come close to Gable . Anthony Quinn as 
Theo Tomasis and J acqueline Bisset as Elizabeth Cassidy do, 
however, manage to rise to the occasion. 

Quinn steals the show with an excellent portraya l of an 
emotional , arrogant yet basically simple man. Quinn was not 
merely imitiating Onassis, for his performance went beyond that. 
Obviously larger in physical stature than the real·life tycoon, I 
didn't see Quinn as Ari , but as any of a number of wealthy men. 

':If you ask me who from rea l life inspired. this character," Qumn says, " I have to say that's like asking Brando who inspired 
him when he played the Godfather. There were many such 
Godfathers. Just as there w re many Greek tycoons. You draw 
from the most colorful. 

"People ask me what it feels like to be playing one of the richest 
men in the world," says Quinn . " I find that a difficult question 
because my character, Theo Tomasis, was not, in the true sense, 
rich . All of us have the misconception that if you own a lotof things 
you're happier because of them, but Toma is ' happiness lay in his 
son, and when he lost his son he lost the fortune inside of himself, 
and he became a very poor man. My character in The Greek 
Tycoon is happiest when he is at his most simple. because he is

in a long, evocative 

"with love the chance of

Black Angel strides towards the 
issue of genocide and takes a 
painfully sympathetic stance . It 
suggests that it is time, not to forget , 
but to forgive . We are everyone of us, 
after all , equally guilty as long as we 
go on hating each other and avenging 
ourselves. 

I recommend this production. 
Cristofer is a playwright of 
remarkable genius and the Mark 
Taper brings his work into sharp 
focus. Seeing Black Angel is like 
being shot by the world's most 
graceful and poetical bullet, like 
falling to the knees in eXQuistely 
beautiful pain and like dying with 
p'hrases of Lieder dancing on the lirS. 
'With love the chance of surviva is 
very slight. Black Angel sighs . But 
"with hate you can go on forever."

YAF halts funds for speakers 
(CPS) - "It's been our first 

really successful venture with 
student fees ," said Bob 
Heckman of the YoungAmeri· 
cans for Freedom (Y AF) ,pride 
and satisfaction evident In his 
voice _ Speaking from Y AF 
headquarters In Virginia , 
HeckIrian was talking abOut the 
victory scored by Ule Univer-
sity of Nebraska ·Lincoln (UNL) chapter of YAF. They 
were able to convince the 
school's regents to halt the 
mandatory student funding of 
the speakers program. 

The key, Heckman said, was 
a first-time apllroach tried by 
the 70-some Y AFers. Following 
a speech given by Jane Fonda, 
the group mailed out 10,000 
letters to Nebraska conserva-
tives, asking them to write the 
regents, and protest the 
funding of " hate America" 
speakers like Fonda through 
mandatory fees. 

The campai~n was success· 
ful. After receiving over 20,000 
letters, the regents passed a 
measure calling for voluntary 
funding of speakers. The 
measure defied a show of 
student support for mandatory 
speaker fees . Students had 
collected petitions with 5,000 
signatures, while a referendum 
produced ad overwhelming 
majority vote for mandatory 
fees. I . . h

director of state and chapter 
services. '·Seeing its effects, 
it's quite possible that other 
chapters may begin to use that 
technique," he added. 

" Usually we start on the 
ground floor with the students, 
and try to get changes throu~h 
a- referendum and such, " said 
Heckman. "But they're rarely 
successful. ' , 

Opposition to mandatory 
student fees has been the 
primary project of YAF 
campus chapters since its 
inception in 1960, Heckman 
said. "YAF's policy is that no 
school or student government 
should require students to 
finance any social, political or 
ethnic group that supports 
views contrary to their own 
moral and philosophical 
beliefs. 
. "We protest against any 

university or college organiza-

tion,- be it black social clubs, 
radical lesbian speakers, 
anyone that uses mandatory 
fees, including student fees, 
tuition dollars or state 
allocations, to take a p,artisan 
role in political issues. ' 

For most Y AF chapters, the 
partisan group at the top of the 
list is the Public Interest 
Research Group (PIRG). As 
Heckman sees It. PIRG S are 
political lobbying groups that (jon't represent all the students 
in their analysis of an issue. 

At UNL, for example, Y AF 
chairman Terrell Cannon 
disagreed with NUPIRG's 
stand on nuclear energy. "The 
statistics they've come up with 
for the dangers of converting to 
nuclear energy are warped and 
contrived," Cannon said. He 
feels the US progress is lagging 
behind other countries in 
nuclear research "because of 
the Naderites." 

"Greek Tycoon" reviewed ... 
(Continued from page 4) 
very human and likes to identify himself with his own people. the 
ordinary folk from whom he has sprung. So he is happiest drinking 
with the sailors at tavernas on the beautiful Greek islands, or 
dancing with the peasant people. Maybe I'm happiest doing that, 
too. 

o 'The movie is not biopic. '· Quinn adds . "To imply that it is would 
be as misleading as saying I'm playing Howard Hughes with a 
Greek accent. Yet the role is an ama 19am. It concerns the inherent 
loneliness of all men of immense wealth, Greek or otherwise, who 
found that riches could not buy life . It's a study in power, in the 
emptiness of power." 

Jacqueline Bisset has a more difficult role, playing Elizabeth 
Cassidy, widow of an assassinated President who later marries 
Toinasis. It is hard to judge her performance, since comparison 
with the still very much alive Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is 
inevitable. Nevertheless. Bisset is secure in a wide range of 
emotions and displays the proper a ir of ha ughtiness one expects of 
her character. 

Edward Albert gives the best performance among the 
supporting actors as Tomasis' free spirited son Nico, who 
eventually dies in an airplane accident. The only disappointm~nt 
among the cast was the stiff performances of James Franciscus 
and Robin CIl:I rke as the Cassidy brothers (nee Kennedy brothers) . 
They acted like they knew their characters would meet the 
assassins' bullet.
