DON’T FORGET: SUN GOD STUDENT FORUM DEC. 4 AT 3 P.M. IN EARL WARREN ROOM

By Christina Homer
Senior Staff Writer

Student voters at the University 
of California’s 10 campuses turned 
out to cast their ballots Nov. 4 at 
a higher rate than the statewide 
average, a UC Student Association 
statement reported last week, and 
UCSD saw the second-highest turn-
out within the UC system. 

In first place was UC Santa 
Barbara with an 81.5 percent turn-
out in eligible voters, followed by 
UCSD at 74.2 percent and UC Santa 
Cruz in a close third at 72.8 percent. 
The state of California had an over-
all average turnout of 67.5 percent. 

The report showed voter turn-
out at the three UC campuses as 
exceeding the average turnout of 
nonaffiliate voters in the campuses’ 
respective districts. At UC Berkeley, 
63.6 percent of students voted, while 
only 60.1 percent of nonaffiliates in 
the district turned out. UCSC stu-

dents voted at a rate of 72.8 percent, 
compared to the 68.8 percent of 
Santa Cruz city voters who cast bal-
lots, and at UCLA the 71.9 percent 
of student voters trumped the 69.6 
percent turnout rate of its surround-
ing district.

“Students’ high voter turnout in 
this election speaks volumes about 
where youth are today and where 

they’re going,” Jennifer Knox, orga-
nizing and communications director 
of UCSA, said in an e-mail. “Young 
people are engaged and taking an 
active role in shaping the world 
around them. Much of the voter 
registration, education and turnout 
work that took place on campus was

13 Months Later, Worker Contract Still PendingUC Berkeley 
Suggests 
Campus-

Specific Fees
By Joyce Yeh
Staff Writer

UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert 
J. Birgeneau released a report last 
month recommending a plan to 
give each UC campus the authority 
to determine its respective student 
tuition. 

The Nov. 21 report, titled “Access 
and Excellence,” proposes that each 
campus be granted the power to set 
its own student tuition, as long as 
it remains within 25 percent devia-
tion from a predetermined midpoint. 
Birgeneau said the objective of the 
plan is to shape the 10 UC campuses 
— Berkeley in particular — into com-
parable alternatives to the nation’s 
elite private universities without 
compromising the university’s public 
nature. 

Birgeneau distinguishes the dif-
ferences between tuition and fees 
within the report, defining student 
fees as an addition to tuition to be 
used exclusively for faculty salaries 
and financial aid. Because the various 
campuses have differing costs in their 
methods of providing education, the 
report contends campus-specific fees

Over 100 students, employees 
and community members rallied on 
Library Walk Nov. 25 in support of 
the university’s 8,500 service workers, 
who have been campaigning for wage 
increases since October 2007.

Amplified by bullhorns, home-
made noisemakers and a steady snare 
drum, the crowd of demonstrators 
marched, chanted and waved placards 
for roughly an hour, ultimately fil-
ing into Chancellor Marye Anne Fox’s 
office.

“It’s not about what we want; it’s 
about what we need,” UCSD ground-
skeeper Jorge Olvera said to the chan-
cellor’s office staff. “[The chancellors] 
are supposed to be here to improve 
and empower the lives of all of us. 
Somehow, that mission got lost.”

According to Olvera — who serves 
on the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees bar-
gaining team — UC service workers 
have seen their wages fall 25 to 30 
percent below average rates at compet-
ing public universities and colleges in 
California. As a result, the majority 
of these employees hold two jobs, and 
96 percent are eligible for public assis-

tance, he said.
The university’s most recent con-

tract proposal, presented Nov. 17 
and 18, includes $26 million in wage 
increases over three years and guaran-
tees a $12 minimum wage in the first 
year of the contract.

In a statement following the meet-
ings, AFSCME officials said the uni-
versity’s offer would translate to annual 
increases of only 1 to 1.5 percent, and 
that it still does not guarantee the step-

based wage-increase system that has 
been one of the union’s key requests 
throughout contract negotiations.

UC spokesman Brad Hayward 
said the university has made repeat-
ed efforts to address its employees’ 
concerns — for example, last week’s 
proposal increased the sum of wage 
increases by $6 million — but that the 
state’s current budget crisis requires 
compromises on both sides.

“We are offering some significant 

wage increases for service employees 
at a time when we and the rest of the 
state are facing a difficult economic 
and budget situation,” he said. “We’re 
looking at the potential of very serious 
budget cuts.”

Although last week’s demonstra-
tion marked the beginning of on-cam-
pus public action for service workers 
this quarter, the event was not the first

 BY BEN HOLM

Neuroscientists at UC Berkeley 
are conducting research on adoles-
cent brains that links delayed devel-
opment of the prefrontal cortex to 
teens’ capacity for complex deci-
sionmaking.

The effects of underdeveloped 
decision processing centers can 
manifest in small and large ways, 
from the inconsequential decisions 
adolescents make on a daily basis to 
decisions to take risks with far-reach-
ing consequences. 

According to recent psychiatric 
studies, more 17-year-olds commit 
crimes than any other age group. 

UC Berkeley assistant professor 
of psychology Silvia Bunge ques-
tions the merit of current legal atti-
tudes toward teenage criminals. 

“Do you put someone away for 
life who lost his temper at 13, or do 
you acknowledge that his prefron-
tal cortex has matured since then?” 
Bunge asked. “The law is slow to 
change, but it will, over time, incor-
porate scientific evidence.”

Bunge is part of the Law and 
Neuroscience Project Foundation, a 
group of neurobiologists and lawyers 
working to incorporate new insights 
about the adolescent brain into the 
legal system. Headquartered in Santa 
Barbara, the foundation’s honorary 
chair is former U.S. Supreme Court 
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. 

Crucial to learning complex rules 
and applying knowledge to chang-
ing situations, the prefrontal cortex 
is also responsible for controlling 
impulses. 

UC Berkeley psychology profes-
sor Robert Knight explained that 
while the prefrontal cortex kicks in to 
remind adults of the consequences 
of their actions and restrain impulses, 
children lack this capacity until the 
brain is fully developed.

“This is a very fundamental issue 
with huge social implications,” Knight 
said. 

Bunge also believes that chil-
dren’s immature brains could explain 
studies that show that they tend to 
take bigger risks than adults and are 
less able to withstand the tempta-
tions of a reward.

“If your friend says, ‘Hey, let’s try 

this drug, it will be fun,’ you might 
not be able to use the information 
you know about the possible nega-
tive consequences to resist,” Bunge 
said. 

After reviewing safety issues 
and security risks, the University of 
California has begun talks with the 
Rothberg International School at 
Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 
hopes of reopening the UC study-
abroad program there beginning in 
fall 2009.

The UC Academic Senate 
Committee on International 
Education approved the plan on 
Nov. 20, and UC Education Abroad 
Program Executive Director Michael 
Cowan is now negotiating terms for 
implementation of the program.

The university suspended the 
EAP program in 2002 after the U.S. 
Department of State placed Israel on 
its travel warning list. In general, the 
university does not sponsor educa-
tional programs in countries included 

on the DOS travel warning list, but 
student complaints have prompted 
the UC Board of Regents to recon-
sider its policy.

The UC risk assessment program 
now utilizes the services of a leading 
risk management technology compa-
ny that analyzes crisis response data 
and regional intelligence to determine 
the changing security conditions of 
regions around the world. Based 
these new capabilities, an ad hoc 
regents working group, formed in 
August, has advised that an excep-
tion to the UC policy is warranted 
for a study-abroad program in Israel, 
as long as the university continues 
to monitor and manage the risks of 
studying in the country.

“The university has undertaken 
a review of the education abroad 
program in Israel and concluded it 
is in the best interest of our students 
to once again provide educational 
opportunities in Israel,” Cowan said. 
“In today’s richly interconnected 
global economy, a study-abroad 
program at Hebrew University of 
Jerusalem would provide a unique 
academic and cultural opportunity 
for UC students.”

of its kind. In June, nearly 400 UCSD 
students and workers staged a similar 
protest with local activists at the same 
site, and their cause drew statewide 
attention in July when thousands of 
service employees participated in a 
five-day, systemwide strike.

In addition, seven labor officials  
representing regional councils in the 
state were arrested in San Francisco 
Nov. 20 after causing a 30-minute 
delay at a UC Board of Regents meet-
ing in protest of the university’s pov-
erty wages.

Rev. Wayne Riggs, pastor of San 
Diego’s Plymouth Congregational 
Church and a member of the local 
Interfaith Committee for Worker 
Justice, delivered an opening prayer 
at last week’s demonstration. He and 
numerous other ICWJ members have 
participated in the service worker 
campaign since negotiations began 13 
months ago.

“Every human being in all of our 
faith traditions is noble and worthy of 
dignity, and when workers are paid so 
little for what they do, it means their 
lives are undervalued,” he said. “That’s 
why we stand with them. This is our 
campus — we’re from right here in San 
Diego — so this is where we come to 
put in our two cents.”

Olvera said Fox and Vice Chancellor 
of Business Affairs Steven L. Relyea 
have previously demonstrated their 
support for the service workers’ cause 
by writing letters to UC President Mark 
G. Yudof, and that if the two officials 
follow up on their requests and engage 
other campus administrators, UCSD 
could set an example for the rest of the 
UC system to follow.

“We are now demanding that they 
put a little more meaning behind their 
actions,” Olvera said.

The chancellor’s office could not be 
reached for comment by press time.

peer-to-peer, meaning young peo-
ple are paying attention themselves 
and working to spread that energy 
among their peers.” 

In the weeks leading up to the 
election, student leaders across the 
UC system pushed registration and 
encouraged students to vote. At 
UCSD, Vice President of External 
Affairs Lisa Chen organized an A.S. 
voter registration drive, and vol-
unteers for the UC Students Vote! 
group made phone calls to nearly 
20,000 students to remind them 
to vote and knocked on a total 
of 4,100 doors in residential areas 
with the highest concentration of 
students. 

Volunteers also stopped and 
conversed with over 8,000 students 
on campus in an effort to increase 
turnout, reminding students of 
their assigned polling locations and 
answering any last-minute questions 
prior to Nov. 4.

On all the UC campuses, stu-
dent governments worked alongside 
other campus organizations to build 
nonpartisan voting coalitions and 
register new student voters.

Turnout data was prepared 
by county clerks for Statement of 
Votes, upon analysis of precinct-by-
precinct registration and turnout 
statistics. Currently, data has not 
been analyzed for UC Riverside, UC 
Irvine or UC Merced. 

“So far we’ve only gotten results 
back from some of our campuses, 
but the early results have been amaz-
ing,” Knox said. “We were hoping to 
get an average of 65 percent turnout 
or more on campuses and it looks 
like we will far exceed that goal. 

Students have been the deciding 
factor in many local and even state 
races. Our work in the past elec-
tion will change the way students’ 
issues are prioritized in this state 
and nation, so we’re looking forward 
to building on our voter turnout to 
win larger victories for students in 
the coming months and years.”

Student voter turnout has tradi-
tionally been lower than the aver-
age California turnout. In 2002, UC 
students voted at a rate 15 percent 
lower than the rest of California. 
However, in the most recent presi-
dential primary, that gap closed to a 
mere 6 percent. 

“We saw that student voter turn-
out has been strengthening over 
the past couple election cycles, and 
knew that students’ enthusiasm 
for this election coupled with our 
strong Get Out The Vote campaign 
would be a recipe for success,” 
UCSC junior and UCSA board 
member Victor Sanchez said in a 
statement.

In addition to encouraging the 
larger turnout, UCSD students and 
administrators planned ahead to 
double the number of campus poll-
ing locations to prevent the long 
lines that voters experienced during 
the 2004 presidential election.

“I do believe students can sustain 
[turnout] and even grow [in influ-
ence] from the last election,” Knox 
said. “Young people have seen their 
work start to pay off and I think 
that will keep them excited about 
tackling bigger and more challeng-
ing issues in our society.”

would allow each UC campus to grow 
academically.

Under the plan, newer UC campus-
es would have the option of decreasing 
fees to encourage recruitment through 
affordability, while the system’s more 
established campuses might choose 
to increase fees — thus reducing the 
student-to-faculty ratio and increasing 
faculty salary to promote excellence in 
research and education. 

Birgeneau added that the fee increase 
would also generate enough money to 
provide financial aid for all students 
who fall within the range of low to 
middle income. Students from families 
of high income, defined as earning over 
$130,000 per year, 
would not be given 
access to financial 
aid and would be 
required to pay the 
full amount of any 
fee increase.

“Some campus-
es might choose a 
lower number to 
enhance their eco-
nomic competi-
tiveness, while oth-
ers, like Berkeley, 
might choose a 
higher number,” 
Birgeneau said in the report. “For 
example, if Berkeley were able to 
institute a fee increase of $2,000 per 
student … it would generate revenue 
up to $70 million per year. A $2,000 
fee increase would increase the total 
cost of attending Berkeley by less 
than 10 percent.”

In addition to a fluctuation in fees, 
Birgeneau said that in order to achieve 
a higher standard of education, student 
tuition should be increased to cover 
one-third the cost of a UC education, 
compared to the currnent one-quarter. 
With the $48 million cut in this year’s 
state-funding and another potential 
$65.5 million midyear cut, in addi-
tion to the predicted freshmen enroll-
ment limit for the 2009-10 school year, 
Birgeneau said his proposal — released 
two days after the UC Board of Regents 

announced the possibility of a student-
fee increase for next year — would alle-
viate some of the university’s financial 
shortcomings.

UCSD spokeswoman Stacie A. 
Spector said Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox has yet to consider any proposals 
as dramatic as Birgeneau’s in address-
ing campus funding issues, continu-
ing to focus on more immediate solu-
tions to the problematic cash deficit. 

“What [Fox] has shared with folks 
from a general standpoint is that the 
current budget challenges from the 
state — and the impact on UC as 
well as the campuses — has prompt-
ed us to cut back on spending and 
costs considerably,” Spector said. “We 

remain focused 
on protecting the 
academic enter-
prise, classroom 
teaching and 
research labo-
ratories, while 
being highly care-
ful and conserva-
tive in how we 
allocate funds.”

Bi rge ne au’s 
p r o p o s i t i o n 
contradicts the 
university’s long-
standing com-

mitment to maintaining equal tuition 
and faculty salaries across all 10 UC 
campuses on the basis that all cam-
puses will eventually reach the same 
level of merit, and the UC Board of 
Regents has consistently opposed past 
proposals to allow campus-set tuition. 
However, UC President Mark G. 
Yudof, new to the issue after entering 
the office in March, said he was open 
to considering Birgeneau’s plan. 

“The president and the univer-
sity respect the views of Chancellor 
Birgeneau, and we will be discuss-
ing those ideas and that proposal 
with him,” UC spokesman Ricardo 
Vazquez said. “Ultimately, it will be 
the regents’ decision.”

By John Garamendi, Lieutenant 
Governor and UC Regent 

Thanksgiving is usually a time when we gather with family and friends to celebrate all the 
blessings in our lives. But for hun-
dreds of thousands of qualified, col-
lege-bound Californians, the holiday 
was filled with anxiety and uncertainty. 
This past weekend was the deadline for 
students to submit their applications to 
state colleges and universities. For far 
too many of these young adults — the 
state’s future workforce — it will be a 
dream unrealized.

California is cutting college admis-
sions and considering tuition hikes 
to help rescue the state from its self-
inflicted billion-dollar financial 
mess. Cutting college admissions and 
increasing tuition would push higher 
education even further out of reach. 
This is a cold dose of reality for an 18-
year-old just getting started.

We are at a critical moment in our 
state’s history. Do we have the same 
foresight to invest in our children as 
our parents before us? Or are we so des-
perate for another short-term fix to the 
state deficit that we’re willing to sacrifice 
our future teachers, solar-energy engi-
neers, film producers and nurses? The 
governor’s proposed $2.6 billion cut to 
education will clearly slam the door 
on 10,000 incoming students at the 
California State Universities. Whether 
it does the same at the University of 
California’s campuses is now in the 
hands of the state Legislature and 
governor. As a UC regent, I urged 
the board at its November meeting 
to remove tuition hikes that had been 
woven into the UC’s budget proposal 
for the next fiscal year.

The regents did the right thing by 
deciding to forgo the fee increases, but 
unless the governor and Legislature 
follow suit and fund the universities, 
fees will rise and enrollment also will 
be cut at the 10 UC campuses.

While there are no easy ways to 
close California’s mounting deficit, 
an inequitable share of the burden is 
being hoisted upon the backs of stu-
dents. That’s unfathomable in a state 
with a $2 trillion economy. This year, 
the only substantive tax increase in the 
budget was a $250 million tax increase 
on the students of California in the 
CSU and UC systems.

The California economy, the sev-
enth wealthiest in the world, was built 
on a free or affordable education sys-
tem that spans from K-12 to commu-
nity colleges, the CSU system and the 
UC system. This has been the founda-
tion of California’s economic success, 
but our commitment to producing an 
educated workforce and astute citi-
zenry is rapidly disappearing with the 
constant tuition hikes. Our state col-
leges are adopting the worst aspects 
of the Ivy League schools — they are 
becoming exclusionary and financially 
out of reach. 

It doesn’t have to be that way. 
California needs about $10 billion to 
close the budget gap, and this will no 
doubt be a painful and difficult task. 
But we are Californians — we perse-
vere in the aftermath of deadly wild-
fires, earthquakes and drought. We do 
so by returning to our core values and 
priorities: the well-being and safety of 
our families, our friends and our com-
munities. Chief among those beliefs is 
the education of our children. We can

Inauguration Day may be over a month away, but with the presi-dent-elect looking more and more 
like the man in charge, I think now is 
a good time to talk about the valuable 
legacy that the 43rd president of the 
United States will leave as he grace-
fully exits the stage after a few last-
minute pardons and appointments 
and such. With so much intense focus 
on Barack Obama, we have read and 
heard little of how George W. Bush 
will go down in history, and while 
many will certainly claim that his 
reign has been a gargantuan failure, 
I argue that we have just witnessed 
his greatest achievement since taking 
office. Without him none of what we 
just witnessed would have been pos-
sible. Without George W. Bush, we 
would have no President Obama.

Let’s start this landscape-altering 
tale with a brief flashback to the year 
2000. That fall, Bush and Democratic 
nominee Al Gore slugged it out for 
the title of Most Boring Older White 
Man in History with Bush declared 
the apparent winner after a painstak-
ing Florida recount. If I had told you 
back then that a young, black junior 
senator from the Midwest would 
completely dominate the entire elec-
toral map, you would have undoubt-
edly looked at me like I was out of my 
head and you would have been right. 
Even in 2004, when Bush was in the 

middle portion of his slow, agonizing 
downward spiral, Democrats contin-
ued fielding their candidates without 
a hint of personality in the form of 
one John Kerry. It was at the 2004 
Democratic National Convention 
that Obama burst onto the scene 
with a riveting speech that conjured 
up more emotion than Kerry could 
have even if he made his acceptance 
speech wearing only his swift boat 
cap. But even at that very recent 
moment in history the American 
people were not ready for a candidate 
like Obama. It would take a man of 
enormous incompetence to pave the 
way for such a radical shift in our vot-
ing behavior. Lucky for us we already 
had our man. And he was ready to 
paint his masterpiece.

The catalog of failures that is the 
Bush administration is nothing short 
of absolute antigenius. In a span of 
only eight years Bush plunged us into 
two prolonged wars in the Middle East, 
eroded our image abroad through 
torture and a stubborn unwillingness 
to compromise with anyone, helped 
to nearly destroy the world’s economy 
and put our country on the verge of 
another depression. Despite all this 
he was also able to make little prog-
ress on important issues like energy 
policy and an overhaul of our Social 
Security and health-care systems. His 
lack of progress in any one area is 

simply astounding. He is obviously 
on a different level. 

However, all of that pales in com-
parison to his ability to get Obama 
elected. It’s not difficult to imagine 
that Bush was planning this the entire 
time. I believe that when he took 
office in January 2001 he set out 
on a deliberate course of destruction 
and failure just so he could ready 
the American people for what was 
coming — and boy did he exceed 
expectations. Not only did he get 
the first black man in American his-
tory elected, but a black man with the 
middle name Hussein who had to 
beat a woman in the primary just to 
earn the nomination. He must have 
just thrown those minor details in 
there for style points as he rewrote 
the rules of political maneuvering.

The educated types will try and 
claim Obama’s election was simply 
a culmination of a number of forces 
that have been at work in our society 
for generations. They will say it was 
inevitable that a strong liberal would 
be elected because of the disturbingly 
conservative flavor the American 
people have tasted for nearly a decade. 
They will say the election of a minor-
ity was bound to happen some day 
as racial and social tensions continue 
thawing in our land of liberty. 

Their arguments may be backed up 
by things like research and data, but I 

adamantly believe that they overlook 
the work of our current president. 

As Obama made his victory 
speech in Chicago, the scene was 
overwhelming. Thousands poured 
into Grant Park to celebrate a sea 
change in American history. People 
of all races, religions and creeds 
cheered an event that could not have 
been possible just a short time ago. 
Many naturally thought of legend-
ary figures from our past like Martin 
Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez 
— men who helped pave the way 
for such a glorious example of per-
severance and willpower. But these 
men were just passing thoughts in 
my mind because I was focusing on 
the man who did the dirty work in 
order to make this happen. The man 
who carefully botched his time in the 
spotlight so that we could all witness 
an event that some thought impos-
sible in our lifetimes. So I want to be 
the first to thank the great George W. 
Bush for sacrificing an entire legacy 
in order to push our country forward. 
Bravo, my good man. Bravo.

GUEST COMMENTARY

By Simone Wilson
Senior Staff Writer

If, after selflessly sacrificing nearly two full years 
of your life, hunched in a scratchy hammock and 
passing your excrement down in buckets, to the 
cause of protecting a helpless, peaceful forest from a 
jock-loving pack of bureaucratic tyrants — if, after all 
that, you still don’t have the support of the Berkeley 
student body — chances are, your gameplan really 
needs some rethinking.

So how did a group of 10 proactive nonstudents 
manage to mess up what seemed like a flawless step-
by-step to fit in with every tree-hugging hippie to ever 
walk the Northern California plains? 

Let’s start with species choice. As irreplaceable 
rainforests all over South America are chipped at 
daily to make space for lumber and cattle — or, if 
in-continent is your thing, as old-growth forests 
find themselves floored and cookie-cuttered into 
vast suburban tracts throughout the United States, at 
exponential rates — the 10-odd starring participants 
in UC Berkeley’s now-infamous tree-sit chose two 
summers ago to protect, drum roll please, a grove of 
common oaks planted in a landscaping project back 
in the 1920s, in danger of being sheared by a big-bad 
athletic structure set to be erected for use by the var-
sity sports teams later that year.

Even if they had been heartbreakingly old or high 
on the endangered list above such wrenching items 
as cute baby tigers, the oaks — in an isolated grove 
surrounded by the concrete and various man-made 
surfaces of a college campus (that is, if we’re not still 
pretending the “green” is some thriving meadow in 
which wildlife still flits and tweets) — could not have 
been crucial to much aside from oxygen production 
and general nature feng shui. Which is why, in initial 
attempts at negotiation, the university promised to 
plant three new trees on campus for each oak that 
took the axe.

But, in virtually the only reasoning the sitters ever 
provided besides love for Mother Earth, they threw 
around vague and unproven claims that the trees in 
fact sat atop historic American Indian grounds. The 
project’s Web site, www.saveoaks.com, refers to a mys-
terious “Grandmother Oak” stump they now wish 
to remove from the grove, even devote 
to the creation of “drums 
and other reli-

gious artifacts.” Even if they cannot be condemned for 
simply being inarticulate, if their movement wished 
to find any real momentum, it needed a clear-cut rea-
son for being so stubborn — one that could perhaps 
engage those not in touch with the spiritual whisper-
ings of the sacred oak grove.

“I see your slogans chalked on the sidewalks. I 
see your Tibetan prayer flags. I pass through clouds 
of your collective body odor and exhaled mari-
juana smoke,” reads the now-famous November 2007 
“Open letter to Berkeley Tree-Sitters” on Craigslist, 
which many still reference in voicing their frustration 
with the protest. “Having observed your actions for 
quite some time now, sometimes I wonder if you’ve 
ever considered just how much damage you’re doing 
to legitimate pro-environment, pro-leftist movements 
everywhere.” With not so much as the staunchest 
of environmentalists on their side — aside from, of 
course, the appreciated few available to lower their 
waste buckets — the tree-sitters indeed under-
mined the liberal expression of discontent 
by making it into a spineless, unorganized 
game.

This precedent, unfortunately, may 
extend to the future punishment of 
such protests. In the end, after 
spending a hard-to-come-by 
$125 million on security and 
police enforcement — not 
to mention a wrap-
around eight-foot 
chain-link fence 
erected around 
the protes-
tors, at 
w h i c h 
point 

they drew the bold, sidewalk-chalk analogy 
“Guantanamo Berkeley” — university officials have 
dragged the tree-sitters to court, twigs still pok-
ing from their dreads-for-the-cause. A high-school 
career’s worth of community service and five days 
behind bars (and they thought the chain-link was 
spirit-crushing) hardly compares to the thousands 
of dollars the university plans to drain from the key 
participants, probably without a thousand dollars to 
speak of, in reparations. Certainly, we can agree, it 
could have been worse. But no matter one’s stance on 
the justness of these consequences, there is a standard 
now set for any legitimate environmental stake-out: 
Could a construction company sue for protester repa-
rations, because their latest tract won’t be done in time 
for the fleet of U-Hauls and shiny-happy families?

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lazaro

Dear Editor,
Why are private businesses being vil-

ified for not printing material they feel is 
objectionable? Just because the Koala is 
exercising its freedom of speech doesn’t 
mean a specific printer must print it. 
The Koala can take its business else-
where if it wants to print material that its 
current printer finds objectionable.

Regarding the content in question, 
if you object to wasting money on a 
statue (which I think is the point of the 
“protected speech”) you can express it 
without taking an image out of a por-
nographic movie. Why does the Koala 
have to appeal to the lowest common 

denominator? All I saw was racism, 
sexism, pornography and general cru-
dity. Are these the things we want to 
expose ourselves to as people who 
are trying to better ourselves through 
higher education?

We need to make sure the 
California Legislature and governor 
understand the history of this great 
state, and how a free or affordable 
public education system has been the 
fundamental fuel for our economic 
growth. California needs to send more 

of its young adults to college, not fewer. 
California needs to attract more top-
notch professors and establish more 
world-class research facilities, not less. 
This will prepare California’s economy 
to excel when it finally rebounds, as we 
all know it will. Our students and our

feeding them. Enough is enough.

▶ Number of undergraduate students who 
received scholarships in 2004, totaling 

$2.53 billion, according to the National 
Postsecondary Student Study Aid.

1,276,000

D awn is breaking and only one page of the philosophy paper has been written. Chemistry lecture is two hours away 
and all but two problems go unanswered. 
Programming homework is due in 20 minutes 
and the code is still a foreign language. Many 
students, even after telling themselves they’ll 
never do it again, corner themselves into situ-
ations where cheating is seemingly the only 
remaining option. 

As the recent arrest of three students 
at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical 
University has made clear, academic integ-
rity is a major concern on college campuses 
nationwide. Accused of hacking into their 
university’s computer system and chang-
ing about 650 grades of over 90 students, 
the suspects face up to 20 years in prison 
for conspiracy, five years for unauthorized 
access of a protected computer and a mini-
mum of two years for aggravated identify 
theft. 

In the aftermath of the allegations, UCSD’s 
Academic Integrity Office is starting up new 
programs, as well as refining current process-
es, to ensure academic integrity on campus. 
This year will see the first of the university’s 
Academic Integrity Seminars, in which stu-
dents caught cheating work with UCSD’s aca-
demic integrity coordinator Tricia Bertram 
Gallant to address the issue and complete  
assignments. 

This year, five undergraduate students, 
serving as peer representatives for the pro-
gram, overseen by Gallant, are putting togeth-
er a campaign for the first week of Winter 
Quarter. 

One issue the campaign will tackle is that 
cheating not only affects the individual, but 
largely contributes to a university’s overall 
academic reputation. 

“As a school gets known as a cheater 
school, employers and grad schools are just 
left to make judgments and assumptions 
about the people they’re seeing; ‘is that per-
son a cheater?’” Gallant said. “It’s actually to 
everyone’s disadvantage if cheating happens 
at UCSD.”

Punishment for plagiarism or 
cheating varies from academic pro-
bation to a quarter- or year-long 
suspension, and — in particularly 
serious cases — can warrant dis-
missal from the entire UC system. 

Last year, there was a record-
high 446 allegations of cheating, 
a total of 56 suspensions and five 
dismissals. However, according to 
Gallant, these numbers don’t nearly 
represent the extent of cheating that 
goes unnoticed. 

“It’s probably just a drop in the 
bucket,” she said. “There’s way more 
cheating than that. Every student I’ve 
talked to has said that.” 

Indeed, there seems to be a lack 
of confidence among classmates as 
campuswide surveys have shown 
the amount of students who actually 
cheat is much lower than the amount 
of students thought by their peers to 
have cheated. For example, though 
only three percent of UCSD students 
admitted to submitting a paper pur-
chased or obtained from an outside 
source, 46 percent believed their peers 
had done so. 

However, when academic dishonesty 
does occur, the social consequences can 
be devastating. 

Computer science graduate student  
Matus Telgarsky got a slap in the face 
when two fellow students turned in a rep-
lica of an assignment he spent a great deal 
of time preparing. 

“For the rest of my life, I will disrespect 
these people,” Telgarsky said. “All that matters 
in academia are your ideas and your reputa-
tion; you can steal ideas, but if people find out, 
your reputation is annihilated.” 

But, according to Telgarsky, getting 
away clean after cheating in the com-
puter science field is extremely difficult. 
Assignments are largely based in submitted 
computer codes, which are checked thor-
oughly by an automated tool that actually 

understands the code. 
Revelle College senior Jason Mallory, a 

transfer student and philosophy major, believes 
that it would be similarly difficult to cheat suc-
cessfully in his department. 

“Some professors use TurnItIn.com; 
you’d have to be really stupid to copy a 
complete paper,” he said. “I can’t even think 
of ways that you could [cheat on an in-class 
exam], it would be so hard to fit so much 
information on a cell phone or even pieces 

of paper.” 
However, dodging the obstacles, some stu-

dents still choose to cheat. 
“The K-12 system is ‘use whatever resourc-

es you need to get yourself into college,’” 
Gallant said. “[They] didn’t counter that mes-
sage with one of integrity and honesty.” 

With 300 to 400 students to a class it can be 
difficult to form a bond with professors, elimi-

A nxious about that impending biochem final? Swimming in a sea of sources for a massive 
research paper? Sarah Lavely has a 
simple solution: break stuff. Turning 
stress and frustration into a quirky 
business endeavor, Sarah’s Smash 
Shack gives everyone the chance to 
indulge their pent-up emotions and 
excess energies by smashing, shatter-
ing, crushing and destroying all things 
breakable.

Located between Ash and A Streets 
in downtown San Diego, Sarah’s Smash 
Shack looks more a cross between  
swanky fine-china shop and hip art 
boutique than a safe retreat where the 
emotionally frazzled venture to blow off 
steam. The small storefront and walls 
splashed with orange paint provide just 
enough room to display the shack’s gleam-
ing breakables — this is where you meet 
Hey Hey (the brown shop poodle), sign 
your life away on a one-page waiver, select 
the items you’d most like to break and suit 
up in a protective red coverall, ’do-rag, gloves 
and mask.  

Once suited up, a tatted-up Sarah or pony-
tailed Ed will lead you to one of two “break” 
rooms. The first is located in the storefront 
and has room for either a solitary smasher or 
a destructive duo. The second room, for groups 

of six to eight, is located at the end of an adja-
cent alleyway. A glowing neon sign leads you to 
this VIP room and  — as always — urges you to 
“break more stuff.” 

Indeed, within these spaces you can wail 
on everything from dishes, shot glasses and 
ash trays (to help you kick the habit) to vases 
and picture frames. You can even bring a 
poster or blown-up picture of your worst 
enemy or ex, and Sarah will pin it to the wall 
so you can play target practice on said enemy’s 
face. She’ll also provide plenty of Sharpies to 
scribble a few spiteful words on all that stuff 
you plan to shatter. 

To further enhance your smashing ses-
sion, each room comes equipped with an MP3 
hookup. Bring music that will pump you up 
— say, Limp Bizkit’s “Break Stuff” — or, bet-
ter yet, music that will piss you off (try Lil 
Wayne’s “Mrs. Officer,”).  The only potential jolt 
from the experience will be the fact that Ed is 
required to watch you through a wide window 
at the front of each break room in the event that 
you decide to pick up a shard of glass. Or, if you  
go too heavy on the  layers that morning, things 
could get nasty under your coveralls.

While one session could be cheaper than 
a visit to a therapist, it could be as pricey as 
unrestricted retail therapy — and leave you with 
some serious buyer’s remorse. There are some 
reasonable packages — like the “Create Your 
Own” deal, allowing you to choose any three 

side items for $33 (this could include a set of 
10 dishes, two vases and six shooters) — but 
the other packages, like the $29 Mystery Box or 
$35 Smash Shack House Special, only include 
10 items. 

Sarah does offer the option of bringing your 
own stuff to smash, but this is just as costly — 10 
of your own items for $20. If the volume of 
items in each of these packages seems modest, 
you’re right. If you don’t pace yourself, your ses-
sion could be over within the span of one track 
off your iPod. After you’ve smashed to your 
heart’s content, however long that may end 
up being, you can wrap up your angst and 
keep it as a memento — Ed will sweep up 
the shards, spiteful scribbles and all, for 
an extra $10.

For a new way to shake the stress 
of finals, get over a messy breakup or 
vent after having worked retail on 
Black Friday, give Sarah’s Smash 
Shack a try.  Sarah understands 
that sometimes you just need to 
break something.

If you have a flair for designing 
golf courses, grew up in the Bay 
Area or simply have an uncontrol-
lable sweet tooth, you may just be a 
candidate for some cold hard cash — 
in scholarships, that is. With tuition 
prices burning a never-ending hole in 
students’ wallets, scholarships from 
UCSD and beyond provide a way to 
dodge debt.

The two major scholarship pro-
grams for undergraduates at UCSD 
are the Continuing Undergraduate 
Scholarship Application and 
the Undergraduate Research 
Application. The first can be found 
on TritonLink in the financial-aid 
section, while the second is located 
at the web address faoforms.ucsd.
edu/forms/9research.pdf.

According to Becky Obayashi, 
the UCSD undergraduate scholar-
ship coordinator for the university 
financial-aid office, the scholar-
ship programs at UCSD are well 
used. She notes that normally 2,000 
applications are turned in each year 
for the Continuing Undergraduate 
Scholarship Application, although 
only 1,000 of these students actually 
complete the application in order to 
be considered. Last year, the pro-
gram gave out 400 scholarships. 
For the Undergraduate Research 
Application, 65 scholarships were 
awarded last year from a field of  81 
applications.

However, Obayashi said that many 
of the prestigious national awards 
such as the Beinecke, Morris Udall 
and Donald Strauss Foundation 
scholarships, reign in surprisingly 
low or even nonexistent numbers of 
UCSD applicants. 

“For the prestigious awards, [stu-
dents] have to be very competitive, 
have really high grades and should 

be well rounded,” Obayashi said. 
“Students of that caliber either think 
they don’t need to go for it, or don’t 
think they need to compete.”

One source of diverse selec-
tions for Tritons  is the Continuing 
Undergraduate Scholarship 
Application, which encompasses 
49 different scholarship programs 
offering up to $5,000 in awards. 
Students can apply to as many 
scholarships as they meet the crite-
ria for; however, only one scholar-
ship is given per student and most 
are for students with a 3.0 GPA 
or above. The application, which 
includes merit, financial-restricted, 
major-restricted and regional schol-
arships, is due February 23, 2009, at 
11:30 p.m. 

The Bay Area Alumni Scholarship, 
granted to full-time students who 
have both financial need and have 
graduated from a high school in the 
San Francisco Bay Area, is one of 
the regionally oriented awards — a 
two-year scholarship providing up 
to $2,000 annually, giving UCSD’s 
NorCal-ers another reason to be 
hella proud. 

For fans of Tiger Woods who 
were tempted to skip finals last June 
in order to watch the U.S. Open, 
the Continuing Undergraduate 
Scholarship Application offers the 
Golf Course Builders Association 
Scholarship for students involved 
in urban studies and contemplat-
ing a future career in golf-course 
design.

The Undergraduate Research 
Application is also an option for 
students. It is open to all majors 
and provides anywhere from $3,000 
to $3,500 in one-year awards. The 
application includes eight different 
scholarships.

For those who prefer a quest for 
cash outside of campus, there is the 
San Diego Foundation Scholarships 

organization. The application can 
be found online at www.sdfounda-
tion.org, and the deadline is January 
23, 2009. It offers roughly 70 schol-
arships for undergraduates, as well 
as a few for graduate students. 

Other private donors can be 
found awarding scholarships for any 
number of reasons and are just a 
Google search away. 

Sophomores, juniors or seniors 
with a weakness for candy may 
be able to get back the money 
lost from trips to the dentist. The 
American Association of Candy 
Technologists Scholarship Program 
is for students who have demon-
strated an interest in confection-
ary technology through research, 
internships, work experience or 
study. 

If you have grandma’s touch for 
knitting itchy wool sweaters, then 
the National Make It Yourself Wool 
Competition can turn your spun 
wool into tuition. The contest is 
open to people from ages 17 to 24 
and runs from Jan. 21 to Jan. 25 in 
2009.

The Little People of America 
and Tall Clubs International offer 
awards to those vertically challenged 
or blessed. A duck-calling co-ed can 
rake in as much as $1,500 and stu-
dents who attended their prom in 
fashions formed solely from duct 
tape could have landed a pretty 
penny toward tuition.

Now adept at scouring through 
scholarships after seven years of 
undergraduate study, Earl Warren 
College senior Jesse Dubler received 
the Donald Stauss Foundation 
Scholarship as well as a number 
of other scholarships over the past 
two years. She received $10,000 
for the Donald Strauss Scholarship,

nating the motivation for academic 
honesty that results from desire to 
keep the respect or trust of a particu-
lar mentor. 

“One of the biggest problems I 
hear from students here at UCSD is 
the lack of connection both to the 
campus and with their professors,” 
Gallant said. “The less relationship 
there is the easier it is for a human 
being to feel like they’re justified in 
duping someone.” 

Furthermore, Gallant believes that 
the “Net generation” wasn’t necessarily 
taught how to correctly handle intel-
lectual property; with ideas, thoughts 
and opinions floating freely online, 
consistently within arm’s reach, she 
feels respect of owners’ rights has 
decreasd. 

Gallant notes that when a stu-
dent is torn between appeasing a 
roommate who wants to use an 
old test and staying true to the 
larger community, the smaller and 
more immediate communities take 
precedent. 

Meanwhile, the integrity of debat-
able study practices such as using 
past exams or working in groups with 
classmates is constatly brought into 
question. 

“There’s a huge gray area,” 
Telgarsky said. “There’s a huge 
spirit of collaboration in schools, 
when you’re in class you talk to 

your friends about it, and at what 
point does that turn into cheating? 
There are technical things you can 
do to mitigate cheating, but there’s 
already a culture formed.” 

Gallant believes this culture is 
partly due to the newness of UCSD’s 
academic integrity program. 

“We haven’t been at it that long,” 
Gallant said. “We need more stu-
dent voice, we need more profes-
sors talking more about it and why 
it’s important. Cheating happens 
in classrooms so academic integ-
rity conversations need to happen in 
classrooms as well.” 

UCSD physics professor Herbert 
Levine said that utilizing or posting 
old exams released by the instruc-
tor is a legitimate and useful way to 
study for new tests. 

“To be fair, there’s a lot of mate-
rial in some courses, and you’d like 
to get some insight into what the 
person teaching thinks is the most 
important points,” Levine said in 
an interview conducted by Joanne 
Tong, an assistant to the academic 
integrity peer educators. “If you 
can get that by looking at past 
exams and talking to past students 
that’s fine.” 

A recent survey on cheat-
ing among college students in the 
North American region, conducted 
by Donald L. McCabe of Rutgers 
University, showed the disparities 

between UCSD and the region. 
Categories in which UCSD students’ 
cheated significantly more than 
the rest of the region were “copy-
ing another student’s homework,” 
“copying material, almost word for 
word, from any source and turning 
it in as your own work” and “turning 
in a paper copied, at least in part, 
from another student’s lab paper, lab 
report, computer program or home-
work assignment.” 

Although glancing at your neigh-
bor’s midterm or copying someone 
else’s homework hurriedly before 
class doesn’t equate to breaking into 
an office building and forging an 
identity to change students’ grades, 
Gallant said that curbing less severe 
behaviors and dealing with them 
early is a possible method of success-
ful prevention.

“All cheating can build habits of 
character that can lead to fraudu-
lent behavior,” Gallant said. “If you 
keep doing little things and get 
away with them and start taking 
short cuts, [it can] lead to more 
serious behaviors. So that’s why 
we want to catch students early 
on. I have more hope for students 
who have been caught than for the 
students who haven’t gotten caught 
but cheat.”

requirements were not as challeng-
ing or academically demanding as 
they appeared. 

“For Donald, I was one of three 
applicants in spite of its fairly low 
GPA requirements,” Dubler said in 
an e-mail. “It may be intimidat-
ing for students to ask for money 
but I’m not sure what’s going on. 
[Scholarships] are surprisingly easy 
to get.” 

The best way to go about snag-
ging these hefty scholarships, she 
explained, is remaining regional.

“The best resource is UCSD 
Financial Aid’s listings as well as 
San Diego Foundation,” she said. “I 
didn’t apply to any of the scholar-
ships listed on [FastWeb.com] and 
the other popular search engines 
since they’re way too competitive.” 

Warren College senior Pouya 
Jamshidi has also recieved numer-
ous scholarships over the past few 
years. For his studies in neuro-
science, he received $3,000 from 
the Chancellor’s Scholarship 
for Undergraduate Research in 
2008, which he found under the 
Undergrad Research Application. 
In the same year he was awarded 
the Howard Hues Medical Institute 
Exceptional Research Scholarship, 
which chooses one student per 

university out of 30 nationwide 
and awards $4,500 for 10 weeks of 
research. The scholarship paid for 
both travel expenses and housing, 
allowing Jamshidi to research last 
summer at Columbia University 
with Nobel prize laureate Eric 
Kandel. 

“The beauty of it is that I got to 
meet people through these scholar-
ships that have potentially changed 
my life,” Jamshidi said. “[The schol-
arships] open many doors and go 
beyond financial support. So many 
people say, ‘I don’t need the money.’ 
It’s not about the money. There are 
many other layers that these scholar-
ships will open up.”

Dubler concurs that money is 
only a small part of the benefits 
and opportunities that scholarships 
bring in.

“After receiving these scholar-
ships, they really did open my doors 
because the more you get, the more 
opportunities come your way,” 
Dubler said. “That’s when I realized 
it is mostly not about the money. … 
It’s about credibility and standing 
out so that other people can find 
you. That is the hidden incentive for 
me now.”

SPLITS 

HOLIDAY 
WEEKEND

By Joe Tevelowitz
Senior Staff Writer

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The Tritons 
picked up their first win of the season 
over the weekend, taking part in the 
Notre Dame de Namur Thanksgiving 
Tournament in Belmont, Calif. The 
Tritons started the tournament off 
right with a 76-53 win over host Notre 
Dame de Namur on Nov. 28. UCSD 
then completed its Thanksgiving 
weekend road trip against Central 
Washington University, starting a 
second-half comeback before even-
tually falling by a 78-70 final score on 
Nov. 29. Junior guard Jordan Lawley 
led the Tritons in both contests, scor-
ing a game-high 17 points against 
Notre Dame de Namur and a career-
best 31 points in the loss to Central 
Washington. UCSD now holds a 1-3 
record overall as it prepares for the 
season’s first conference competi-
tion.

After scoring only one bas-
ket in the first seven minutes, the 
Tritons trailed early against Central 
Washington. The Wildcats built an 
eight-point advantage with four 
three-pointers early in the first half.

However, with Central 
Washington falling ice cold from a 
long distance, UCSD put together a 
10-1 run to take the lead with eight 
minutes remaining in the first half. 
Lawley capped the run with a steal 
and layup that put the score at 20-
19.

Notre Dame de Namur All-
Tournament Team honoree Jake 
Beitinger responded to the UCSD 
streak, scoring five straight points to 
put Central Washington University 
back on top. Senior guard Alan 
Husted’s three-point basket and three 
free throws from Lawley helped the 
Tritons tie the game at 26 with less 
than five minutes remaining in the 
half. Unfortunately, head coach 
Chris Carlson’s squad was unable to 
keep pace with three Wildcat three-
pointers down the stretch, as UCSD 
trailed 44-34 at the half.

With three more connections 
from behind the arc in the first four 
minutes of the second half, Central 
Washington took its biggest lead of 
the game, 57-40. With 15:35 left in 
the game, Lawley and senior guard 
Shane Poppen took over the Triton 
offensive output. After five straight 
points from Poppen, Lawley rolled 
off the next 11 UCSD points with a 
combination of jumpers, free throws 
and a three-pointer. Poppen then 
responded with the next five points 
before Lawley capped the duo’s 
showing with a free throw that cut 
the lead to six — 68-62 — with just 
over seven minutes to play.

As defenses stepped up and the 
hot shooting cooled down on both 
sides, neither team scored for the 
next three minutes. Husted’s layup 
with 3:44 remaining ended the dry 
spell and brought the score to 68-64. 
However, after missed shot opportu-
nities on both ends, Beitinger hit a 
jumper to give Central Washington 
a six-point lead, with the Tritons get-
ting no closer the rest of the way.

“Their guys were just making 
shots and we dug a hole for ourselves 
that was just too big to climb out 
of,” Husted said of the team’s first 
loss to a Division-II opponent. “Our 
defensive intensity was much better 
in the second-half, but we couldn’t 
overcome our lackluster defensive 

Tritons Prove Their Worth at Nike Cup

SWIMMING — After many, many 
miles in the pool, the UCSD swim 
team completed its first major tour-
nament of the season — the Nike 
Cup. It was a long and grueling meet, 
but the Tritons emerged as a stronger 
team with great hopes for the future. 
The team competed in over 20 events 
in the course of three days and con-
fronted Division-I strongholds such 
as UC Irvine, Cal State Northridge 
and Brigham Young University. 
Despite the arduous meet and the 
lofty opposition, the Tritons demon-
strated their grit and determination 
and showcased great performances 
from some of their best swimmers.

The meet began in the afternoon 
on Nov. 20 with a strong showing 
from the women’s 200 yard freestyle 
relay team, which took second place 
with a time of 1:43.40. Led by fresh-
man Shea Kopp and followed by 
senior captain Aubrey Panis, junior 
Ashtyn Douglass and senior Erinn 
Deters, the team gave the Tritons a 
solid first race of the day. 

“We swam really well,” Panis said. 
“It was good to see us go out there 

and swim like that.”
After the Triton women had a 

strong race with their opening relay, 
the men’s team — led by fresh-
man Sam Stromburg, senior cap-
tain Daniel Perdew, freshman Blake 
Langland and junior Todd Langland 
— knew they couldn’t be outdone, 
following with a third place fin-

ish and a final time of 1:22.61. But 
Perdew wasn’t done yet. To epitomize 
the day for the Tritons, Perdew swam 
an incredible 50 yard freestyle race, 
taking first place with a time of 20.44 
seconds.

“I’m not going to lie, it felt pretty 
awesome to swim that fast,” Perdew 
said. “I swam way faster than I ever 

had before at this point in the sea-
son.”

After a strong first day for the 
Tritons, both the men’s and women’s 
teams were sitting in fourth place, 
ahead of Division-I squads UC 
Irvine and University of the Pacific, 

Rookie Nets Top-25 Finish at Nationals
By Brianna Lee
Staff Writer

CROSS COUNTRY — Senior 
Jake LeVieux and sophomore Bre 
Schofield were greeted with an early 
winter when both harriers traveled 
to Slippery Rock, Penn., to repre-
sent UCSD in the NCAA Division-II 
National Championships, which were 
held on Nov. 22. With the ground 
covered in snow and flanked by bar-
ren trees, Cooper’s Lake Campground 
looked like the quintessential picture 
of December, and although it made 
for a great winter landscape it did not 
exactly make for an ideal running 
course. In spite of the frosty condi-
tions, UCSD’s harriers were able to 
battle through the weather and their 
rival runners to finish strong. 

In the men’s 10,000 meter run, 
LeVieux got off to a solid start, occu-
pying 42nd place after the first mile. 
The Triton harrier could not sustain 
his position, but still pushed to a top-
100 finish, seizing 92nd place with a 
time of 33:06. Scott Bauhs of Chico 
State claimed first place in the race. 
The Wildcats have proved to be one of 
UCSD’s tough adversaries; the Tritons 
fell to them earlier in the season dur-
ing the conference championships in 
San Bernardino. Bauhs would go on 
to earn All-American honors and was 
named the Division-II Cross Country 
Male Athlete of the Year.    

On the women’s side, Schofield 
— in her first season of collegiate-
level competition — could not have 
been more true to form as she put 
in another compelling performance 
to complete her outstanding season, 
anchoring 22nd place with a time of 
22:19 for the women’s 6,000 meter 
event.

“I wanted to represent my team 
and the West region well,” Schofield 
said.  “I also wanted to really work 
hard because work ethic creates good 
results.”

In the grand pool of 189 runners, 
Schofield fought for every second 
of her time, coming up short by a 

mere two seconds to Slippery Rock 
University’s Jaime Wright. As for the 
freezing weather, Schofield said she 
brushed it off as the race started.

“The weather was kind of intense,” 
Schofield said. “There was snow in 
my face and my leg muscles began to 
stiffen throughout the race. But being 
cold wasn’t really a factor. When the 
race was about to start, I stripped off 
all my clothes and was fine when the 
gun blew off. I ran in just my buns.”

Schofield’s results mark 
UCSD’s highest finish since 2002. 
Furthermore, she was one of just 
three California Collegiate Athletic 
Association female athletes to earn 
All-American accolades by virtue of 
her top-25 finish.

“It feels great that I was able to be 
an All-American,” she said.  “There’s 
nothing like knowing you earned that 
title. It’s rewarding to bring some-
thing home for my team and for 
myself. Although [coach Nate Garcia] 
and I wanted [my finish] to be in 
the top 15, the race felt like the most 
challenging of the season so I was 
extremely happy with my accom-
plishment.”

Although the men’s and women’s 
cross country teams as a whole failed 
to qualify, LeVieux and Schofield’s 
presence at nationals adds to the 
Tritons’ distinguished team history. 
Moreover, with such a tightly knit 
pack of harriers, the 2008 season 
laid the groundwork for a promising 
future. 

“In the future, I plan to be in the 
top 10 at nationals — never losing 
the number one spot as a goal either,” 
Schofield said. “Us ladies go big or go 
home at UCSD so we set our goals 
high because we know we’re all des-
tined for good things. Of course with 
more experience, the women’s team 
is going to grow and get really strong. 
We will have a tight pack in the future 
and I can’t wait for all of us to be 
rewarded for our hard work.”

The Tritons wasted no time in the largest meet of their season so far, posting impressive swims in the men’s and women’s 200 yard freestyle relay 
races on the first day of competition. Senior captain Daniel Perdew pulled out a first-place finish in the 50 yard freestyle on the opening day as well.

See SWIMMING, page 15

teams notched multiple

and also ahead of bitter rival Loyola 
Marymount University. 

“We killed Loyola Marymount,” 
Panis said. “It wasn’t even close.”

Day two of the meet also had 
outstanding finishes from some top 
Tritons. The women’s 200 yard med-
ley relay team — comprised of Kopp, 
freshman Sadie O’Brien, sophomore 
Jessica Ferguson and Panis — took 
third place with a time of 1:45.50. 
The Triton women also posted a 
strong showing in the 800 yard free-
style relay race, taking fourth place 
with legs by freshman Alexandra 
Henley, sophomore Anju Shimura, 
Douglas and once again anchored 
by Panis. 

“We put together some times we 
would be happy to see in March 
in the finals,” head coach Scott 
McGihon said. “It was great to see us 
go out and perform like that.”

Some outstanding individual per-
formances included senior Kendall 
Bohn finishing second in the 100 
yard breaststroke with a time of 
1:03.79, Shimura taking fourth place 
in the 200 yard freestyle with a time 
of 1:51.46 and Henley placing fourth 
in the 200 yard individual medley 
at 4:27.60. The women’s team took 
fourth overall on the second day 
of competition with the third and 
final day of competition looming 
ahead. On the men’s side, the Tritons 
had a very successful 800 yard free-
style relay, with a team consisting 
of Perdew, sophomore Brandon 
Maryatt, freshman Michael Lorch 
and Todd Langland finishing fourth 
in 6:55.47. 

But the Tritons’ top performance 
was undoubtedly in the men’s 200 
yard medley relay team of senior 
captain Steven Hardy, junior Pablo 
Carrillo, Perdew and Todd Langland. 
The UCSD men took second place 
with a time of 1:32.21 and finished 
the second day in fifth place, looking 
ahead to their last day.

“A lot of people swam faster than 
we expected them to,” Perdew said. 
“The meet went really well.” 

The Tritons continued to post 
strong swims on the final day of 
action. Bohn took first place in the 
200 yard breaststroke with a time 
of 2:16.16 and to close the day, the 
women’s 400 yard freestyle relay took 

fourth place with a time of 3:27.00. 
On the men’s side, Perdew was not 
done with his domination of indi-
vidual events as he took yet another 
first place, this time in the 100 yard 
freestyle in 44.78 seconds. Close 
behind Perdew was another elite 
UCSD swimmer, Todd Langland, 
who took second place in the same 
event, finishing only a quarter of a 
second later. As the day was com-
ing to a close, the Tritons knew 
they needed a strong finish before 
their long break between meets and 
they delivered. The 400 yard free-
style relay team with Todd Langland, 
Brandon Maryatt, Blake Langland 
and Perdew, took second place with 
a time 3:03.74. Overall, the men’s 
team took fifth place at the meet with 
679.5 points and the women’s team 
took fourth place with 817.5 points.

At the end of the three-day com-

petition, the women’s team quali-
fied 14 swimmers for nationals and 
the men’s team qualified seven. The 
Tritons have no competitions in 
December and will commit them-
selves to training for their next meet 
on Jan. 10 when the Triton women 
host Loyola Marymount.

“We have finals week but after 
that we have training camp for a few 
weeks to prepare for our next dual 
meet in January,” McGihon said.

The Tritons will have their first 
real experience against conference 
opponents in a dual meet with Loyola 
Marymount, which will help deter-
mine where UCSD stands. At the 
Nike Cup, the Loyola Marymount 
women finished seventh with a total 
of 383 points.

performance from the first-half.”
Lawley’s 31 points bested his pre-

vious career-high of 24, which he 
scored against Alaska Anchorage in 
the first round of the NCAA tourna-
ment last season. Three other Tritons 
scored in double digits, as Poppen 
added 14 points and a game-high 
seven rebounds off the bench, while 
Husted and senior guard Kelvin Kim 
scored 11 points each.

While committing only one 
more turnover, grabbing three fewer 
rebounds and shooting an impres-
sive 23-of-30 from the foul line, the 
Tritons were unable to keep up with 
Central Washington’s shooting from 
the field. The Wildcats converted 
nearly 60 percent of their shots in 
the first half, including 8-of-15 from 
behind the arc, and shot an impres-
sive 51.9 percent in the game.

The Tritons had the hot hand 
during their opening game of the 
tournament against Notre Dame de 
Namur, as Lawley, Kim, Husted and 
freshman center Ryan Wheeler each 
contributed for the Tritons, scor-
ing the first nine points. While the 
Triton offense cooled down, stout 
defense held the Argonauts to only 
seven points through the game’s first 
12 minutes.

However, UCSD was able to wake 
up on the offensive end to close 
out the half. After Notre Dame de 
Namur cut the advantage to two, 15-
13, with 4:34 to play before the break, 
the Tritons more than equaled their 
scoring output to that point. Husted 
scored 10 of UCSD’s next 16 points, 
including a steal and layup with three 
seconds remaining in the first half, as 
the Tritons went into the break with a 
31-20 advantage.

Husted continued firing out of 
the break, opening UCSD’s second-
half scoring with a three-pointer. 
Lawley followed that up with a pair 
of jumpers and another long-dis-
tance basket as the Tritons quickly 
increased their lead to 16 just four 
minutes into the second half. The 
Argonauts were unable to get any 
closer than 14 points the rest of the 
way, as the Tritons continued their 
shooting exhibition. UCSD took its 

first 20 point advantage of the game 
with 5:58 to play after two Wheeler 
free throws. Wheeler followed that 
up with another jumper for UCSD, 
before Poppen scored inside on con-
secutive possessions with a layup 
and exclamation-point dunk off of 
an assist from senior forward Patrick 
Dreith. Dreith capped off the win 
for UCSD as his layup with 27 sec-
onds left gave the Tritons a 76-52 
advantage and their largest lead of 
the game.

UCSD shot a blistering 69.6 per-
cent from the field in the second 
half and grabbed 36 rebounds in the 
game, compared to only 26 boards 
for Notre Dame de Namur. With 13 
Tritons seeing game action, Carlson 
received a balanced attack from his 
squad. The UCSD bench outscored 
its Notre Dame de Namur counter-
parts 26-12 in the second half, while 
three Tritons scored in double digits.

“It was great for us to get our first 
win of the year on the road against a 
Division-II opponent,” Husted said. 
Guys coming off the bench have 
been doing a great job this season. 
Shane [Poppen] and Casey [Ryan] 
have been doing a great job of pro-
viding a spark and bringing their 
high energy to the court. Our big 
men are doing a great job as well bat-
tling inside and are going to be huge 
as we get into the conference.”

Lawley led the way with 17 points 
and was named to the Notre Dame 
de Namur All-Tournament Team 
after averaging 24 points during two 
games. Husted added 16 points and a 
game-high five assists, while Wheeler 
scored 10 points on 4-of-6 shooting 
from the field. Poppen again grabbed 
a game-high seven boards as UCSD 
scored nine second-chance points 
and 26 points in the paint during a 
victory in which it never trailed.

The Tritons return to action this 
weekend, facing Humboldt State 
in a California Collegiate Athletic 
Association opener on Dec. 5. UCSD 
then hosts Sonoma State on Dec. 6. 
Both games are scheduled for 7:30 
p.m. tip-offs at RIMAC Arena.
