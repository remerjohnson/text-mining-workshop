UC ADMISSIONS 

Institutional barriers 
and limited outreach 
efforts may be culprits 
of stagnant Latino 
enrolfment figures. 

By Hadley Mendoza 
SENIOR STAFF WRIHR 

The U.S. Censu BureaU' report-
ed that as of 2004, 35 percent of 
Californians were Latino. Meanwhile, 
UCSD lags drastically behind in the 
numbers game, and in 2005 onJy 12 
percent of those admitted were Latino 
students. 

According to the UCSD Chicanol 
Latino Concilio, a group comprised 
of alumni, faculty, staff and students, 
the small number of Latino students 
at UCSD is due to strudural inequali-
ties and i not a result of cultural or 
socioeconomic factors. 

ODe IIImiNions statistic is telling 
of where the IfOUP placea the blame: 
As of 2005, only one in five Latino 
studeota admitted to UCSD actually 
enrolled.

For State's Good, UC Panel 
Stresses Health Science Reform 

By Christina Homer 
CONTRIBUTING WRI TER 

The leading advisory body for 
the growth of UC health programs 
recently concluded a study that 
recommended extensive changes 
to the system's schools in order 
to accommodate the state's rising 
need for medical profeSSionals. 

The council's purpose was to 
review an earlier study conducted 
by the Health Sciences Committee 
and recommend specific targets 
for health sciences enrollment for 
2020. 

Ji... June 2005 report released by 
the HSC stated that California will 
be short by as many as 17,000 
phYSicians by 2015, and 116,600 
nurses by 2020 due to an aging 
work force, increasing population 
and lack of growth in medical edu-
cation. Demand for pharmacists 
is also expected to increa e as the 
number of issued prescriptions is 
far exceeding the current number 
of pharmacists in California. 

In addition, the report found 
that California rank 49th in the 
nation in number of nur es per 
patient, and 43rd nationally in the 
number of pharmacists per capita. 

HSC developed its prediction 
model using the number of cur-
rent active physicians in the state, 
the number of first -year graduate 
residents, the number of students 
received from out-of-state schools, 
the expected number of retirees 
and overall population growth. 

The current shortfalls are made 
worse when con idering enroll-
ment in UC health sciences pro-
grams, which has remained flat for 
the past 30 years. During the same 
time, the population grew by 52 
percent. 

In light of the findings, the advi-
sory body, co-chaired by Provost 
and Executive Vice President for 
Academic Health Affairs Wyatt R. 
Hume and Regent Sherry LanSing, 
recommended a large increase in 
enrollment at UC schools in the 
areas of medicine, nursing, phar-
macy, public health and veterinary 
medicine. 

In the area of medicine, the 
council pushed for a 34-percent 
increase in student enrollment, 
including medical residents COOl-
pleting clinical training after grad-
uating from medical school, by

EVICTION 
By Matthew McArdle

Although administrators submitted 
two dates for members of controversial 
satirical student newspaper the Koala to 
submit appeals countering the publica-
tion's eviction from its office in the wake 
of a June discovery of alcohol and drug 
paraphernalia, both deadlines have 
passed with no ad mini trative action, 
and the paper ha kept its office. 

Because drug and alcohol pos-
ses ion is against university policy, 
member were ordered to leave their 
Media Lounge office pace by Oct. 25. 
However, member protested, accusing 
the administration of failing to provide 
adequate time to submit an appeal. 

In response, A sistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Gary R. 
Ratcliff gave the Koala until ov. 9 to 
submit an official written appeal. T hat 
appeal, however, was never formulat-
ed because members felt, as Eleanor 
Roosevelt College senior and Koala 
Editor in Chief David Gregory stated in 
a letter to Ratcliff, that the deadline was 
"artificial and arbitrary.'

Committees Criticize 

Telemedicine Plan 
Within the Nov. 7 education 

bond measure is a $200 million 
al location to expand "telemedi-
ci ne" at UC medical schools - a 
plan that has been shot down by 
two legislative pane ls. 

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger'~ 
enthusiasm was offset by the state 
Senate Education Committee and 
Ihe Assembly Highe r Education 
Committee, who said that the bond 
money sho uld be spent on higher 
priorities, such as . updating build-
ings and equipment, broadening 
medical school e nrollment and 
augmenting medica l care in under-
served areas. 

However, the curre nt telemedi-
cine plan lacks detail, according 
to legislators, who said it seemed 
incomplete. The state still needs 
UC approval before spending the 
money.

The te lemedicine portion of the 
UC expansion proposal appeared 
to "resonate" at the Capitol, which 
caused the state to reorder its pri-
orities, according to UC officials; 
however, they still hope the state 
will fu nd a 10 percent increase 
in medical school enrollment next 
year.

Run at Referendum Split Busts, but 
Vote on Whole Package to Come 
T he A.S. meeting was crowded again with student athletes supporting the athletics fee 
referendum. introduced at the previ-
ous meeting. 

Earl Warren CoUege sophomore 
Arundathi Gururajan confidently 
stated her opinion that the refer-
endum. which would increase the 
quarterly fee students pay to support 
athletics. should be split into separate 
parts. The proposal irked the sea 

is one. there are students who will 
engage in a 'don't vote' campaign and 
that will kill the initiative:' 

John Muir CoUege Sophomore 
Senator Meghan Oair stood against 
the split. comparing it to a table with 
two legs. "Students would be buying 
a crappy table," she said. 

Another councilmember stated 
that if students opted to buy a "crap-
py table:' they were within their full 
rights to do so. "Who wants 10 buy 

a crappy table?" of disgruntled 
athletes at the 
meeting. many 
of whom were 
already upset by 
the amount of 
time the council 
was taking to put 
the initiative on 
the baUot.

College Senior 
Senator Ellen

The propo· 
sition to split 
the referendum 
failed 7- \5-0 and p.feytser.jr@gmail.com 

The split this week proposed that 
the first question include a $12.34 
quarterly increase for each student to 
support student athlete grants-in·aid 
and the annual budget shortfaU. The 
second question was to add $65.05 
per student quarterly to support "the 
growing needs of intercoUegiate ath-
letics and campus recreation sports 
program." 

"It is not the students' respon-
sibility to shoulder something the 
administration should be support-
ing:' Gururajan said. 

Recently impeached former John 
Muir CoUege Junior Senator Aida 
Kuzucan also supported the split. 

"There is a population of students. 
like me. who are rich on paper and 
poor in the pocket; Kuzucan said. 

A.S. President Harry Khanna 
supported splitting the fee referen-
dum. 

"You need at least 4,000 students 
to vote," said Khanna. "' know you

with bureaucratic motions. 

The first was to make the cur-
rent item old business. which passed 
and was immediately foUowed by a 
motion to reconsider the order of the 
agenda, which also passed. 

After a point of privilege by Vice 
President Internal Janine DeI.Iomes 
on proper councilrnember etiquette. 
a motion to suspend bylaws to allow 
debate passed, at which point anoth-
er councilmember motioned to elect 
the speaker. The motion to continue

dum failed. aUowing the council to 
elect Earl Warren CoUege Senior 
Senator Michelle Yetter as speaker 
of the council, who in turn abdicated 
her position for the night to former 
speaker Dellomes, to allow her to 
introduce an amendment to split the 
fee referendum.

President Khanna 
Predicted Defeat 
Against Deans 
~ DEANS from page 1 
ment - 'with the last vote made by 
the John Muir College Council after 
an hours- long debate. 

Many council members argued 
over Ihe swap of elecled col-
lege officials for ones elected by 
the entire campus, a part of A.S. 
President Harry Khanna's attempt 
to trailblaze a new form of univer-
sity politics. 

Several deans spoke out against 
the constitution during the ratifi-
cation process. sparking inquiries 
into deans' role in college politics 
and whether they overstepped thei r 
advisory bounds in publicly chal-
lenging the student legislation. 

" I doubted that college coun-
cils would ever ratify our proposal 
when some of the deans are so 
ardently against the new constitu-
tion;' Khanna stated in an e-mail 
to the A.S. Council announcing the 
docu'ment's approval. 

Muir Dean of Student Aff;tirs 
Patty Mahaffey. the only one of the 
deans to have a vote on their respec-
tive college councils, voted against 
the reformed constitution but did 
not return a call for comment. MCC 
eventually approved the constitu-
tion by a vote of 9-7. 

Khanna, along with a task force 
of A.S. councilmembers, was a key 
aUlhor of the revised policies. He 
said many, including the oppos-
ing deans. perceived his plan as an 
"attack on the coUege system," which 
previously allotted 24 voting posi-
tions on the A.S. Council to coUege 
senators. 

Under the new constitution. that 
number would be halved in favor of 
all-campus representation.

Survey Says: Infonnation 
Illiteracy a Loollling Problelll 

By Natasha Naraghi 
ASSOCIATE OPINION EDITOR 

In a world where Google rules 
the Internet with its continuous 
innovation, our ability to exploit 
its search engine software seems to 
have stagnated. 

At least that was the conclusion 
of the Educational Testing Service's 
preliminary report released earlier 
this month. The organization sur· 
veyed students' information and 
communication technology literacy 
- "the ability to use digital tech · 
nology, communication tools and 
networks appropriately to solve 
information problems in order to 
function in an information society," 
according to the report - and the 
results were both astonishing and 
worrisome. 

The test included 14 short assign· 
ments, each relating to a specific 
area of I CT literacy, and one longer 
assignment assessing what the test 
calls the "Access and Evaluate per· 
formance areas.n 

After assessing over 6,300 stu· 
dents from various colleges and high 

CLARISSE MI GUEUGU;\RD/;\N 

schools (where only seniors were 
tested), the findings showed a popu· 
lation of young adults of which only 
a select few are ICT literate - but 
that isn't even the most su rprising 
part. When searching information, 
·only 40 percent entered multiple 
search terms to narrow results," 
"only 50 percent of test takers used 
a strategy that minimized irrelevant 
results" and only 35 percent could 
choose the correct revision to refine 
the results of a broad sevch. 

And when it carne to assess· 
ing the reliability of the results, the 
students showed equally poor skills. 
When asked to judge the scholarly 
quality of the Web sites, only half of 
the students were able to properly 
gauge the objectivity, authority and 
timeliness. 

Figures aside, however, the dis· 
coveries illustrate a festering prob· 
lem: the disparity between user abil· 
ity and software capabilities. The 
solution, thankfully, is relatively 
Simple and would be hugely suc· 
cessful - educate students. With 
a list of general education reqUire· 
ments that includes everything from 

math and science to language and 
art , the only ingredient missing is 
a comprehensive course on how to 
best utilize available technology. 

For example, Eleanor Roosevelt 
College'S writi nt series attempts 
to achieve this goal, but fails in 
its weak execution. Making of the 
Modern World III requires only a 
one·class visit to the library, with 
an information session on how to 
search the U CSD library catalog, 
along with other scholarly journal 
archives, such as JSTOR. But its lack 
of depth and limited scope make it 
a wholly ineffective solution to the 
problem. 

What we need is a comprehen· 
sive course that explores everything 
from Internet searches, to Web site 
credibility, to accessing UCSD's infi· 
nite scholarly resources, to citing 
this information and how best to 
apply it to various classes. Not only 
would it educate this generation 
about the basics of technology use, 
but it would likely boost student 
performance in other subject class· 
es, particularly the humanities. 

There is only one flaw in the ETS 
study and its conclusions. The pre· 
liminary report did not randomly 
select students for the ICT literacy 
test, slightly invalidating the assess· 
ment. Instead of random sampling, 
ETS left student selection for the 
survey up to the individual schools, 
which used a number of methods 
for picking students. 

According to the report, ·Some 
chose to test students enrolled in 
a particular course, some used a 
random sampling process and still 
others issued an open invitation

tives.n 

As a result, ETS plans to con· 
tinue studying this field of educa·

though, the group estimates the 
test is 88 percent reliable, ·which

reliability of many other respected

Gov. Must Elaborate on Plan for Covering Uninsured

wholesale horror firsthand (i.e. war).

cuffs, jawing about which of their 
kids deserved the last Superman of 
the "Superman Returns" action· figure 
line. Yes, that's war too - when forc· 
es not in your control narrow your 
options so much that only primitive 
and brutal choices remain. 

So since these choices are between 
being charged with assault, being 
assaulted yourself or giving up that 
plastic shit· piece that doesn't even 
look like Brandon Routh; wintertime 
shopping at least dons the battle tenet 
we call "do or die." Nintendo Wii or 
die. Armband iPod accessory or die. 
Tickle Me Elmo or die. 

Yes, more zealousness, but the 
phrase is the foundation of how I 
will measure commercial clout: The 
closer a consumer will get to death 
for a product, the hotter that product 
must be. 

One specimen: Tickle Me Elmo 
Extreme. I assume the surname is 
based on this version's increased 
range of mobility. This doll stands, 
falls, rolls over, slaps the floor a couple 
of times, then gets back up again, all 
the while uttering his staple caw. Just 
by showing more joke appreciation, 
the new Elmo has nestled hlmselfinto 
this season's animatronic must-haves. 
A Los Allgeles TImes article chronicled 
the original doll's booming impact 
on the toy industry, and the likely 
prospect of TMX doing the same. In 
the piece, Scott McCall, a Wal·Mart 
executive, recalled how consumers 
tore through his whole store's Elmo 
supply in 30 minutes. 

I was not so lucky. On Nov. 25 at 
Mission Valley's Target, flanked by the 
forces of motherdom on the rubber 
roundabout of checkout aisle five, was 
the store's last Elmo Extreme. What

Gov. Schwarzenegger 
wants coverage for all 
Californians - now 
he needs to hammer 
out the details. 

By Nathan Miklos 
OPINION EDITOR 

Just weeks ago, Governor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger set Sacramento 
atwitter when he told a Los Angeles 
audience that one of his major goals 
would be to expand he-.tlth insurance 
coverage. 

· We feel we shouldn't have 6rnillion 
people uninsured," Schwarzenegger 
said. "We maybe cannot solve the 
whole problem, but we definitely can 
cut it in half and do something that 
really is impressive, and show the rest 
of the nation that it can be done." 

Then, during a Nov. 27 inter· 
view on NBC's "Meet the Press:' the 
governor went a step further, telling 
host Tim Russert that in addition 
to reforming the prison system and 
pushing forward a redistricting plan, 
he wanted to ensure covfrage for all 
of the state's 6.7 rnillion uninsured 
citizens. The plan would also encour-
age a healthier lifestyle as well as take 
advantage of technological advances 
to streamline medical services. 

The sentiment is a good one: An 
ounce of prevention - particularly in 
health care - is easily worth a pound 
of cure. According to the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality, a 

federal agency that 
gathers data

opportunity to sell old books and buy new ones I 

on the health care system, five of 
the top 10 reasons for hospitalization 
are related to cardiovascular disease 
- which is in many cases preventable. 
Preventive medicine and early detec· 
tion of health problems drastically 
reduce both the cost of treatment and 
the likelihood that medical compli. 
cations will arise. And the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
estimate that physical inactivity and 
obesity cost California over S7 billion 
in medical costs, either directly or 
indirectly. 

Schwarzenegger's plan has the 
potential to save the state billions of 
dollars in the long term - and prob· 
ably thousands of lives - if it can be 
implemented. But the devil is in the 
details, and so far Schwarzenegger 
has only outlined how the plan WOll't 
be paid for, reiterating his seemingly 
eternal pledge not to raise taxes. 

"The governor believes very 
strongly that a solution of this magni· 
tude is going to require shared respon· 
sibility among employers, individuals, 
insurers, doctors, hospitals and the 
state:' Schwarzenegger's chief spokes. 
man Adam Mendelsohn told the Scm 
lose Mercury News. 

What that means in practical 
terms is anyone's guess. 

The governor may turn to a sys· 
tem similar to the one hammered out 
by Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 
- a Republican who also must con· 
tend with a Democratic legislature in 
a typically left·of·cent.er state - that 
requires all residents to obtain health 
insurance by next July. The law would 
apply only if the state determines that 
affordable insurance is available for 
each citizen, and the poor and small 
businesses will receive subsidies to 
help cover the costs of insurance. 
Businesses that don't provide coverage 
for their employees will be assessed 
a fee. 

But many financial analysts 
have suggested that such a program 
would be prohibitively expensive in 

-

California, arguing that the Golden 
State has a larger population of unin· 
sured, poor citizens and illegal immi· 
grant, and a smaller proportion of 
companies that already offer insur· 
ance. According to the California 
Health Foundation, this kind of sys· 
tern could cost the state an additional 
S9.4 billion per year. (The state has 
already spent more than SIO billion 
this year supporting the uninsured and 
underinsured, according to Kimberly 
Belshe, Schwarzenegger's secretary of 
health and human services.) 

Last year, a coalition of business 
interests - with Schwarzenegger's 
blessing - successfully repealed a 2003 
law hastily passed by the Democratic 
assembly just before former Gov. Gray 
Davis' recaU. Many complained that 
the law, which required certain firms 
to provide insurance for their employ· 
ees, didn't go far enough, covering 
only 1 million uninsured Californians. 
Companies, in turn,lamented that the 
bill was expensive enough to drive 
them out of business. Further, the bill 
was silent on the self· employed and 
firms with fewer than 50 employees. 

If a plan covering all the unin· 
sured never gets off the ground, 
Schwarzenegger has indicated he may 

[j

instead try to guarantee insurance 
coverage for California's children. 
Covering the state's nearly 10 million 
kids would be expensive in itself - an 
estimated SSOO million to cover just 
over 760,000 uninsured children. 

But in 2005, Schwarzenegger 
vetoed a similar plan, ironically, 
because the bill contained no funding 
mechanism. 

With the state faCing a budget 
shortfall of over $5 billion, coming 
up with a workable plan that satisfies 
lawmakers, businesses and the public . 
while leaving the state's coffers intact 
would be no small feat. 

Conduding his Interview with 
Russert, Schwarzenegger refused to 
support a specific presidential candi· 
date, saying that he would wait until 
their positions were fully supported. 

" I think that all of our candidates 
that are out there are talking about 
[these issues):' the governor said. "But 
I will see as time goes on when they 
really zero in on those subject :' 

For Schwarzenegger and his as·yet 
nebulous health insurance plan, we'll 
do the same.

ensued was this era's vers ion of the 
Wild West standoff. 

Bed,y, a springy woman in a Puma 
jumpsuit, is awed that she has even 
een the item in per on . 

"Oh my God:' she gasps to the 
cashier, pointing to the fluffy creature. 
"You guys have the new one?" 

"I asked someone already and I 
got the last one:' says Trudi, who 
add that the toy is for her 5-year-old 
daughter. 

It turns out Becky has a 5-year-old 
too. The two continue the info se sion 
casually, uIltil Trudi say, "It wiggles 
its butt too:' 

Becky's eyes narrow. 
"God, my kid would love that:' 

ilence, then the tumbleweed. 
While nothing is said, I can ee the 
two measuring how much flesh they 
would cut for a e ame Street boot)'-
shake. 

"A hu ndred bucks," says Becky, 
Trudi stays quiet, though I'm not 

su re if she's a Iy negotiator, or just 
baffled at the concept of betraying 
her child. 

"Okay, $1 IS, c'mon now," Becky 
continues. 

"You shouldn't do this here:' pleads 
the teenage cashier. 

Trudi ended up selling the doll to 
Bed.:' lor $ I 15 in Target's parking lot. 
Both women - who declined to gIve 
their full names because they realized 
that they looked like they were "acting 

a fool" - were happy with the deal. 
But how clo e to danger would 

Trudi or Becky have been willing to 
go? 

"It's a teddy bear with a motor:' 
says Becky. "I ain't going to fight for 
it:' 

"Yeah:' repeats Trud i. "No reward 
in fighting fo r a motorized teddy 
bear:' 

OK, so no kill -order needed for 
Elmo, just a relatively obscene amount 
of cash and the will to wreck a kid's 
Christmas. 

But omeone ha to be willing 
to kill/die for next -generation video 
game consoles, and I found one of 
these chmuck at Mira Mesa's Best 
Buy on Nov. 21 . Playing a demonstra-
tion version of intendo Wii, I had a 
few elf-revelations. 

For one, I will never look good 
trying to move like a 250-pound 
boxer. Also, I'll never face another 
2S0-pound boxer in the ring. Third, 
the Wii lets me do those things. 

"Man, fucking hurry up;' says the 
kid behind me. 

The tween huffs like he's in the 
throes of asthma, or he's trying to 
intimidate me. He probably just fig-
ured out masturbation, having recent-
ly graduated from nose-picking, so 
I top short of wringing his stringy 
torso. I leave the store without killing 
the twerp. That's my holiday spirit. 
Plus, I don't want to put the Wii on 
the hot list.

THURSDIIV, NOVEMBER 30,2006 THE UCSD GUIIRDIIIN 

.commissioner: Campus Does Not Meet Latino Needs 
~ LATINOS, from page 1 
them. 

"Chicanos and othe.r underrepre-
sented students usually enroll else-
where because the UCSD campus 
climate manifests elitism and insti-
tutional racism," Patrick Velasquez, a 
member of the Conciljo, stated in an 
e-mail. "The current VCSD admin-
istration has yet to provide a plan 
o r any substantive action to change 
the fact that Chicanos have remained 
frozen at approximately 8 percent of 
the undergraduate student body for 
over 10 years." 

The group cites outreach as a key 
failure at VCSD. Velasquez stated that 
he recognizes the Preuss School as an 
alternative to outreach, but the school, 
which caters to low-income students, 
has never made a Significant differ-
ence in VCSD's Latino population. 

According to A.S. Commissioner 
of Diversity Affairs Marco Murillo, 
VCSD doesn't appeal to Latino stu-
dents because the school environ-
ment is not accommodating to its 
Latino students. 

"Many Latino students who visit 
UCSD do not feel welcome on our 
campus, which makes them opt for 
other universities;' Murillo stated in 
an e-mail. 

In order to better serve Latino 
students, the university needs to take 
some serious step forward , Velasquez 
stated. There is a serious lack of Lati no 
students and leader hip on campus; 
all six provosts are white, and without 

a stronger racial balance, even Latino 
students who are admitted will likely 
feel alienated on campus, he said. 

There are also structural issues 
within the state's high school sys-
tem that perpetuate the current racial 
imbalance. Students from poorer dis-
tricts - mainly minority students 
- don't receive the same college prep-
aration, and are critically impaired 
when formulating thei r college appli-
cations. 

"Our education system is failing 
to prepare all students to be UC-eli-
gible;' Murillo stated. "It is usually the 
students who a.re already underrepre-
sented in the UC system who are least 
likely to gain acceptance because they 
attended high schools [that] did not 
set them on a track that would make 
them eligible for UC admission," 

While the university is taking 
sieps toward a balanced racial profile, 
it is n ot doing enough, according 
to Velasquez. In 2003, the Concilio 
recommended hiring a chief diversity 
officer, but the university hired only a 
part-time staff member with no bud-
getary or staff support. 

"Despite our recommendations, 
the Chicano/Latino studies minor 
and program are funded at the 
pathetic rate of about $ 1,000 a year 
(much less than the university spent 
on a rock, bear statue):' Velasquez 
stated. . 

Both Murillo and Velasquez stated 
that in order to boost Latino numbers, 
UCSD needs to take a serious look at

its admission techniques, and work 
harder to adjust its policy in ways that 
would make admission more attain-
able to underrepresented students. 

The Concilio is currently work-
ing with Vjima, a coalition of black 
faculty, staff and students at UCSD, 
to promote a greater level of diversity 
on campus. 

"Given the unequivocal, empirical 
research evidence of the relationship 
between diversity and learning, we 
cannot truly consider UCSD an 'excel-
lent' institution with such a dreadfully 
low level of diversity in all dimensions 
of campus Ufe;' Velasquez stated.

Council Recommends New Vet School 
~ MEDICAL, from pag 1 
2020. Although the council agreed 
that planning should continue for a 
new UC chool of medicine, to be 
located in a medically underserved 
region such as California's Central 
Valley, the co uncil recommend-
ed focus ing expansion on existing 
VC schools using new ProgTams in 
Medical Education at all five UC 
medical centers. 

Designed to help physicians better 
meet the needs of a diverse popu-
lation, P.R.I.M.E. programs at each 
separate school will focus on different 
medically underserved portions of 
the population. 

In 2004, UC Irvine launched 
the pilot P.R.I.M.E. program for the 
Latino community. 

The inaugural class of eight stu-
dents received language and cultural 
traini ng, "hands-on" experiences 
in Mexico and specialized train-
ing focusing on medical issues that 
impact Latinos in higher numbers. 

Other P.R.I.M.E. programs that 
focus on underserved urban and 
rural Californians are planned for 
the medical schools at UCSD, UC 

• • • • • 

••••• 

San Francisco and UC Davis. A final 
P.R.I.M.E. program is planned for the 
UCLA School of Medicine, which has 
yet to adopt a program focus. 

The council recommended a 50-
percent increase in nursing master's 
s'udent enrollment by 20 I 0, a 25-
percent increase betw'ee n 20 I ° and 
20 15 and an additional 25-percent 
increase by 2020. 

The council also recommend-
ed a 100 percent increase in phar-
macy doctoral students and phar-
macy residents by 2020. At UCSD's 
Skaggs School of Pharmacy and 
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Associate 
Dean of Student Affairs Anthony 
Manoguerra said that, currently, the 
school does not have any plans to 
increase enrollment. . 

"It won't be until 2009 before we 
reach our steady state enroll ment 
goal of 60 students:' he said. 

The council recommended a 180 
percent increase in master's and doc-
toral student enroll ments by 2020 
in the area of pUblic health, stat-
ing that this would be an important 
step in responding to the serious and 
growing deficiencies in the state and

national public health work force. 
The council proposed a shorter 

timetable for UC veterinary medi-
cine, recommending tha t enrollment 
increase by 29 new velerinary medi -
cal students by 2008, with the even-

tu~J goal of 60 students. 
The UC Davi.s School of Veterinary 

Medicine has already partnered with 
UCSD to provide a program of veteri-
nary education in Southern California. 
Students at the VC Veterinary Medicine 
Center in San Diego study at the 
Laboratory Animal Medicine Program, 
the an Diego Zoological Society, the 
Navy Marine Mammal Program, the 
Sea World /Hubbs Research Institute 
and the U CSD Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography. 

Although thi s joint program pro-
vides an educational foundation, the 
council emphaSized the need for a 
comprehensive school of veterinary 
medicine in the area, and recom-
mended the creation of a new veteri-
nary medicine program or school in 
Southern California.

Dean Had No Bearing on Revelle Rejection of Constitution, Senator Says 
• COLLEGES, from page 3 

Sixth College Dean James 
Stascavage said that hi s biggest and 
on ly concern lay in the dramatic 
reconstruction of the A.S. Council 
senate. The Sixth College tudent 
Council approved the constitution 
8-2. 

"While it is unlikely, it is now 
possible under the new structure 
that very few senators could come 
from most colleges, and many sena-
tors could come from one college; 
Sta cavage stated in an e-mail. 

But dean, who serve as advis-
ers 01 paper, should not be allowed 
to take a public stance on student 
issues, leanor Roosevelt College 
Senior Senator Erik Rodriguez-
Palacios said. 

Rodriguez-Pala ios also said that 
he often clashes with his own dean, 

Patricia Goen . 
") never understood why the 

dean is automatically the adviser to 
the council and why the adviser is 
a member of the student counciJ;' 
Rodriguez-Palacios stated in e-mail. 
"The adviser for the student council 
at ER is in no way accountable to 
either the student council or to stu-
dents and should therefore not be a 
member of the council." 

ERC ended up ratifying the 
constitution 13 - 3, but Rodriguez-
Palacios, a member of Khanna's task 
force, said that Goen's opposition 
could have swung the vote the other 
way "if the task force was not there 
to stand up to fight for what the 
students wanted:'

sel to students new to the college 
system , according to Revelle College 
Junior Senator Heidi Laidemitt, who 

al 0 serves on the task force. 
Other student politicians agreed, 

saying that the institutional knowl-
edge offered by dt'ans henefit the 
campus' student politicians, who 
usually only serve one term and 
have no long-term reference for their 
decisions. 

"[ Revelle College Dean Renee 
Barnett Terry] is a k.nowledgeable 
source for our council; Laidemitt 
stated in an e-mail. "As an adviser, 
she makes time to meet with our 
councilmembers and help them 
develop in their positions. As a non-
voting member on our council, she 
is our most direct connection to 
Revelle College and the campus:' 

Within Revelle College Council 
meetings, Terry was vocal about her 
opposition to Khanna's plan. She 
was unavailable for comment. 

Revelle College rejected the con-
stitution 6- 7, but Laidemitt said Terry 
had no bearing on the decision. 

Two college deans, Earl Warren 
College's Paul Dewine and Thurgood 
Marshall College's Ashanti Hands, 
voiced no public opinions on the 
constitutional reform. 

Warren's student council rati-
fied the new rules unanimously, 
while Marshall, in effect, rejected it 
because it failed to meet the mini-
mum number of approving votes 
needed for passage. 

Khanna said he respected the two 
deans' decisions to leave "this A.S. 
constitution issue truly a student 
issue and let the students make up 
their minds:'

Koala Accuses Administration of Bias 
• kOALA, from page 1 

·Your office has held evidence 
against us for over four months - one 
week is an insufficient time to deter-
mine our defense and possible course 
of action," Gregory stated. 

In addition, Gregory stated that 
tbe administration's appeal option 
- which would have given Ratcliff 
the final decision regarding the appeal 
outcome - gave too much power to 
one person. 

"In this case, the Koala would be 
denied due process because of its inabil-
ity to depose witnesses, have a fair and 
public hearing and have an impartial 
mediator, arbitrator or student jury; 
Gregory stated. 

Ratcliff responded with his own let-
ter' offering the Koala a later deadline, 
Nov. 21 , with a decision on the eviction 
to be delivered to the Koala by Nov. 27. 

However, the Koala did not submit an 
appeal by the second deadline either, 
and the organization remains in its 
Student Center office. 

"The administration is not han-
dling this situation correctly;' Gregory 
stated in an e-mail. "They're making 
up bullshit procedure as they go." 

Gregory also accused the admin-
istration of being biased against the 
newspaper because of a historically 
rocky relationship with the university, 
including the publication of content 
that lampooned Ratcliff himself. 

Ratcliff, however, stated in an 
e-maiJ that the university "has no 
bias against the Koala," and said its 
interest in the case is solely keeping 
campus facilities free of prohibited 
substances. 

In June, a Student Center employ-
ee walking by the organization's office

noticed the prohibited items in plain 
sight and notified campus police. The 
items, which included a bong that 
contained residue that tested posi . 
tive for marijuana, have since been 
disposed of because the incident was 
not handled as a criminal maner, 
according to Ratcliff. 

Gregory said that the Koala is not 
worried about losing its office and 
that members were "laughing at [the 
administration's 1 impotence." 

"Ratcliff's actions show that we're 
in the right," Gregory stated in an e-
mail. ·Why else would he be afraid to 
face us in an appeal process?" 

The administration has not 
offered any additional propositions, 
according to Gregory.

t's a black-and-white Christmas, and all 
through the house, this audience will snore 
while Toby Maguire squeals like a mouse. If 

your holiday wish is a somber and stylistically authentic 
recollection of the Cold War paranoia your grandparents 
stiU drone on about - with a taste of modem HoUywood 
that only Danny Ocean and Spiderman can offer -
Steven Soderbergh is your Santa Claus. His latest ode to 
a time before color follows two superpowers: the United 
States and the USSR, as they compete for control of post-
WWII Germany; and two superstars: George Clooney 
and Maguire, as they duke it out over the affections of a 
conniving prostitute (Cate Blanchett) for a "Casablanca"-
inspired dose of espionage and intrigue. Dec. 25.

n 2009, aU women will suddenly become 
infertile. By 2027, humanity will have 
descended into chaotic dystopia. Activist-

turned-bureaucrat Clive Owen is recruited by ex-wife 
Julianne Moore and her band of humanitarian rebels 
to save the world's last hope: a mysteriously pregnant 
teenager, the first in 18 years. Not only does this sci-
fi film take a frightening look at the future, it does 
so with pure realism - London 2027 has every last 
technological detail, coupled with street grit a.nd grime 
that shows a society long devastated and without hope 
for urvival. Director Alfonso Cuaron is known for 
his breathtaking and innovative style, from the sexual 
tour-de-force "Y Tu Mama Tambien" to the family fare 
of "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" - and 
his latest seems to be no exception. Dec. 25.

the crew and cast of ' Blood Diamond" isn't shy about it: Their film 
is meant as a commentary. And while most of the prerelease gossip 
whispers about the film's stance on the global diamond industry, 

actor Djimon Hounsou says the film, in which he plays a slave miner who hap-
pens upon some rare bling, touches on other African troubles. 

"We're not just talking about the illicit trade of diamonds:' Hounsou said 
in an interview. "It's about child soldiers, the displacement of villages, wide-
spread corruption throughout the country and so many other things that afflict 
Africans." 

Joining Hounsou on the crusade is Leonardo DiCaprio, playing a heartless but 
conflicted arms dealer, and Jennifer Connelly as a fresh-faced journalist investi-
gating diamond commerce's shameless rape of slave workers in Africa's diamond 
fields. They all wrangle and rile in the messy, war-torn backdrop of Sierra Leone, 
where Hounsou races to save his family from the clutches of Arnold Vosloo in his 
umpteenth tour as a viUain. 

Pick any standard filin-with-a-political-message element (for example: 
• children at risk and families dismantled because of a syndicate of evil people), 
I and "Blood Diamond" has it. But the film's emotional gravitas, DiCaprio said, 
• sets it apart from it pedestrian counterparts, and drawing him to his second 

critically hyped role this year. 
"A political film doesr\t bring any tangible change to audience," he said. 

"One hand feeds another. But it's rare that such a m oving story be attached to 
something political like this, and 1 jumped at the opportunity." 

Shooting on location, the crew was slammed by the worst of the African envi-
ronment. Flaring heat, sudden rainstorms and layers of dust made the production 
unforgiving, but nothing can rattle a Hollywood star with an agenda. 

" It was harsh:' DiCaprio said of the fLlming. "It was physically and emotion-
ally demanding. But it was for a greater cause, for the people of Africa. And that 
was what changed all of us:' 

Amnesty International has thrown its support behind the fUm, and an official 
off-shoot Web s ite encourages audiences to support the film's cause. 

But if you're more inclined to believe DiCaprio himself - and missed Don 
Cheadle's "Hotel Rwanda", Tim Robbins' «Catch a Fire" and the classic "Tsotsi" - a 
trip to see "Blood Diamond" could convince you of Africa's economic and social 
corrosion, then part you from a doUar or two in donations. Dec. 8.

hat could beat watching a group of sorority girls 
getting hacked to bits over the holiday season? 
Throw in cookies made out offamily members and 

nudity - Christmastime gold. "Black Christmas" is a 
remake of the 1974 classic, where eight "sisters" receive menac-
ing phone calls from a previous house resident and begin to die 
- yes, you guessed it - one by one! The original, a brilliant little 
gem predating the rise of the "slasher flick" in the 1970s, was 
remarkably scary and surprisingly tidy, as it relied on the unseen 
rather than smearing it across the screen. 

Unfortunately for every horror buff out there, remakes usually 
translate into "Add more blood!; and director Glen Morgan hasn't 
picked actresses we can root for - or even gawk at. However, one 
of the originals - the talented Andrea Martin, who played Phyllis 
in the '74 version - now tackles the role of Mrs. Mac. Dec. 25.

two, Gardner makes a decision to shoot for a high-paying, professional 
job. But while struggling to land an internship, father and son must first 
endure the trials of being broke: The two are evicted, and at one point 
forced to sleep in public restrooms at the ubway station. "Pursuit" is 
the holiday's ultimate feel -good movie - because what could better 
capture the Chri tmas spi rit than a family's realization that the pur uit 
of happiness revolves around cold, hard cash? Dec. 15.

A college graduate is recruited in the late 
1940s to help jump-start America's new spy ring 
- the CIA - but gets caught up in the para-
noia and deception of the Cold War. Doesn't 
sound interesting yet? Add a script by Eric Roth 
("Forrest Gurnp"), a cast featuring Matt Damon, 
Angelina lolie, Robert De Niro (who also direct-
ed), Joe Pesci (his first film after an eight-year 
absence) and Alec Baldwin. The film looks like 
gold, shiny and worth every pound - espe-
cially with everyone swooning over the formulaic 
Jason Bourne and James Bond films. "TIle Good 
Shepherd" takes the spy game to its earliest days 
of bare-bone secrecy and trench-coat intelligence, 
not necessarily the thoroughly refined organiza-
tion we have come to know. Fear not - guns will 
be drawn, bodies will disappear and trust will be 
shattered all along the narrow European aIley-
W3J1S colored in Cold War shades and film noir 
shadows. And hopefully we'U see Pesci do what 
he does best: beat the living hell out of everyone.

THE HOLIDAY 
The new cut from veteran chick-flick screen-

writer and director Nancy Meyers ("Father of the 
Bride") promises to fill the holiday's feel-good -
romantic-comedy gap. Cameron Diaz and Kate 
Winslet decide to swap houses (and countries) 
after their respective relationships fail, and find 
love where they least expect it. With ditzy 
blonde comedy from the girls, British gag-me

cracks, "Holiday" will provide that annual 
warm fuzzy feeling, but not much else.

This year, 
give all the 
gifts we wish 
were ours 

THE MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION BYMAITHEWlfA\J1TT 
Fashion: W is a fashion magazine that 
couples the standard language of fall 
accessories and must-have frocks with 
some stunning pictures of scantily clad 
celebrities. In fact, it won the 2006 
National MagaZine Award for photog-
raphy, so you can mention composi-
tion and lighting when your girlfriend 
catches you looking at pictures of a 
sand-covered Cameron Diaz rolling 
around on the beach. If you're going to 
let a photograph tell you that you, too, 
can pull off a tunic, at least make it a 
well-shot one. 

Fiction: If the names Haruki Murakami, 
Holiday Reinhorn or Margaret Atwood 
peak your interest, Zoetrope is your 
quarterly. The magazine collects the 
best of a dying genre, contemporary 
short fiction, and presents it under the 
guidance of a guest designer. Each issue 
is unique and artistically independent, 
falling somewhere between the preten-
sion of The New Yorker and the read-

ability of Rolling Stone. You can even 
impress your hipster friends by telling 
them Kurt Vonnegut used to contrib-
ute. 

Nerdy Eclecticism: Have you ever been 
annoyed by that person at a party who 
has a story for every occasion and a sta-
tistic for every story? It seems that, no 
matter the topic of conversation, they 
can incorporate the gestation period of 
a kangaroo mouse or the latest advance 
in neurological nanotechnology. With 
Mental Floss in hand, you will become 
that person. The magazine has how-to 
guides for summer fun, a section devot-
ed to explaining the cryptic and often 
terrifying world of art and humanities 
and the courage to attempt 311 under-
standable expl3Jlation of modern-day 
science. Subscribe and join the thick 
ranks of knoW-it-alls. 

Also consider: Esquire, The Utm Reader, 
Vanity Fair and Nat/onal Geographic

entire life, from birth to age 100 (3Jld 
no, the last step isn't death, but Austin 
Powers' old friend, cryogeniC freezing). 
This nifty guide includes such life-chang-

right-wing (age 50 - complete with flow 
chart!), reuniting your rock band (age 
78) and disinheriting your undeserving

The whole world drinks 
coffee, so why not do 
it in style? Everyone 
could use a good mug, 
not only to warm up the 
chilly winter months, 
but also to arouse 
thoughts of you. Spend 
a few bucks on a coffee 
cup you can personal-
ize by slipping in fam-
ily pictures for a relative 
or coUege snapshots 
for a friend. Whether 
it accompanies its new 
owner to class or work. 
a new custom mug will 
not only help lift energy 
but also morale. 

Customized Calendars: 
Kinko's is good for more 
than just last- minute 
copies and birthday 
catds. It also allows 
for the easy creation 
of personalized calen-
dars. All you have to do 
is pick out one photo 
for each month of the 
year, send them in and 
voila - you have just 
transformed your year-
ly calendar idea into a 
memorable montage.

Woody Allen and His New Orleans Jazz Band 
DEC. 19/8 P.M. 1 COPLEY SYMPHONY HALL 1 $20 

Watch any Woody Allen film 
- the influence of jazz on his life 
and art is undeniable. It was only 
a matter of time before Allen , a 
long-time clarinet player, gathered 
a lineup of talented jau musicians 
and started making the musIc 
himself. 

Normally, film-made celebrities 
who try their hand at making music 
fall flat on their faces with lack of 
talent. But Allen takes a different 
route than rock-star hopefuls like 
Bruce WilliS and Jared Leta: He's 
long surrounded himself with the 
greats and schooled himself in the 
fundamentals of jazz, currently 
living out his dedication to the music 

by touring with his New Orleans 
ensemble. Allen 's understanding of 
the clarinet shines through articulate 
yet slinky notes, crooning alongside 
the scale-sliding trombone of Jerry 
Zigmont and the pulsating horn 
blasts of Simon Wettenhal l. 

Dixieland , often overlooked in 
favor of founding artists like Louis 
Armstrong, Benny Goodman, Charlie 
Parker and, later. Miles Davis, 
played a key role in the growth 
of an American phenomenon. The 
fundamentals of jau - from swing 
to bop to cool-were all introduced 
by early Dixie artists. Allen's highly 
recognized commitment to the 
styles of such an undervalued 

WITH GOGOL BORDELLO

period is key in keeping its soul 
alive. His music is the closest thing 
this side of Bourbon Street to the 
sound and spirit of those crackly old 
78s your grandparents played on 
their gramophone - save for the 
Disneyland Dixie band, but who's 
going to pay $100 to see a band 
with 'a 20-minute set? 

Allen brings his own brand of 
New Orleans jau from the streets 
of Manhattan to Copley Hall on Dec. 
19. Joining Allen in his 21st-century 
resuscitation of an oft-forgotten 
musica l foundation will be Zigmont 
and Wettenhall , Cynthia Sayer on 
piano, Conal Fowlkes on string bass 
and Rob Garcia on drums. (CM)

Honestly, I thought the whole survey was a joke. I did it Jor the free drink. I figured the 
guitar was just some lame way of trying to get people to Jill out the questionnaire. I didn't 
even think there was a real guitar in the case that was on display. 
Anyway, I guess now that I'm holding it I'm glad lfilled out the survey. This guitar 
kicks ass! I was going to buy myself a guitar from Wal-Mart for Christmas but th'is is

'Bobby' Woos a New Liberal Generation 

HANDBOOK (continued) 
Magic Bullet 

A blender is a must-have for any college student living in his or her 
first apartment and, while it may not seem like the most exciting item 
to unwrap, oftentimes it is the most desirable. 

That's where the Magic Bullet comes in. It's billed as a "personal, 
versatile countertop magician that can do any job in 10 seconds or 
less" - all true. The Bullet can do a smoothie in six seconds, a cup 
of spaghetti sauce in five and most adult beverages in four. Plus, it 's 
tiny, taking up less counter space than your average coffee mug - the 
perfect solution for all cramped coeds. - Kristyn Kennedy 

THE SEASON DVD BYCHARLESNGUYEN 
When winter break has you 

looking for a couch-friendly 
DVD, a whole season's worth 
of television can easily do the 
most damage to that sofa's ass 
groove. HBO's holiday buck-
et includes the complete "Six 
Feet Under" series, a 25-disc 
anthology of the show's witti -
cisms and black humor, packed 
into a fancy case resenibling 
a burial plot. That colossal set 
is flanked by another HBO 
gem, "The Sopranos," which 
just re leased the first half of its 
24-episode sixth season. The 
show's writers go for the throat 
by shooting Tony again , hook-
ing Chris y aga in and punching 
Lauren Bacall for the first time 
(see it to believe it). 

~etwork television makes its 
run at the holiday market with 
the fifth season of "24," which 
won Kiefer Sutherland his first 

Emmy for the series. This sea-
son, the life of Sutherland's Jack 
Bauer again goes to shit as he 
hurdles terrorists and dirty 
politicians in a one-day race to 
divert the fifth disaster - this 
time nerve gas - that he's seen 
hit the globe. 

But if worldwide implica-
tions aren' t your flavor, the more 
intimate sett ing of a Beverly 
Hills high school could be your 
thing. For '90s lovers like me, 
it's been a tortuous wait for the 
first season of "Beverly Hills 
90210." Fox execs teased us 
for years by releasing only the 
series' first episode on DVD. 
But now comes all 22 episodes, 
stuffed full of nostalgia (the 
Spring Dance, Brenda lOSing 
her vi rginity, Donna starting 
moking) that you should be 

very embarrassed to acknowl-
edge. Oh, wait ... 

~ BOBBY, from page 12 
mentary footage, in a voice so espe-
cially inspiring and majestic against the 
with-us-or-against-us caveman rheto-
ric of the current administration. 

This film will be analyzed in two 
ways: by those who were alive during 
the assassination and by those - like 
me, and the vast majority of college 
students - who were not. 

My father, 19 and, at the time, not 
old enough to vote, had been cam-
paigning for Kennedy, much like some 
of the film's characters. "I felt powerless 
. .. only liberals with compassion and 
righteousness, it seemed, were mur-
dered;' my father said when I asked 
him how he was affected by the murder. 
Ideals were useless, it seemed, against 
the mindless violence of anti-liberals. 
There would be no one who could 
convince me that justice was obtainable 
through the political process. There 
would be no more Bobby Kennedys 
- our quota of inspiring social reform-
ers had been exhausted:' 

For his generation, seeing this film 
will be an homage, a tribute to a col-

_ _ lective reckoning of the event, ending 
I at the moment of Kennedy's death but 

leaving the audience - swept in by 
the words of one of his most prolific 

speeches at its close - to ponder the 
political climate leading up to to!by. 

Many of the stars in "Bobby" were 
born long after their characters, forced 
to merely imagine the Shattering of 
national optimism by a gunshot. A 
few weeks ago, "Bobby" actors Shia 
LeBeouf and Brian Geraghty sat side 
by side in a downtown San Diego hotel, 
talking about the impact of the histori-
cal event on a new generation. 

"We're not much farther from 
where we were then;' LeBeouf said. "In 
30 years, we haven't made much prog-
ress - we're still in a fucking retarded 
war, you know, still losing people for no 
reason, still got hatred rolling around, 
racism is still alive:' 

" [Kennedy1 was a courageous guy 
- he was selfless," Geraghty said. 
"[Back then1 a presidential candidate 
made contact with people out of non-
selfish reasons." For those of us who 
only have Clinton and the Bushes for 
comparison, the film evokes an unfa-
miliar nostalgia for a hopeful time we 
didn't know, a yearning for a leader 
who let his wall down and articulated 
the possibility of younger input into 
social change. 

"Why do [kids1 vote for 'American 
Idol' more than they vote for the pres-

CONSIDER NURSING 
CHOOSE COLUMBIA 

Columhia l ' nh {'rsity 
School of !\lIrloiing 

ident? 'Cause they see their results," 
LeBouf said. "They call up and vote 
for Clay Aiken and see it go from 83 
percent to 84 percent ... with all this 
red tape, the Electoral College, kids 
feel like their vote doesn't mean shit:' 

I recall waiting in line two hours to 
vote for the first time in the governor 
recall election, only to hear the results 
announced from a TV set before I even 
dropped my ballot in the box. 

"Are you going to vote?" I asked 
LeBeouf and Geraghty - the interview 
was, incidentally, on Election Day. "As 
soon as we get out of here," they said. 

Estevez's ftIm rekindles a shared 
latency, a wish to act, to voice some-
thing, to join someone - but not 
knowing quite what or where or who. 
Hopefully it can remind us of the pos-
sibility for personal and global justice, 
not solely regulated by government 
officials. As always, Kennedy put it 
best: "Each time a man stands up for 
an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of 
others or strikes out against injustice, 
he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, 
crossing each other from a million 
different centers of energy and daring 
those ripples build a current which 

-can sweep down the mightiest walls of 
oppression and resistance:'

Swan Lake -
• Beast Moans 
JAGJAGlIWAR 

***~ 
With a debut album like Beast Moans, it's only fitting that two of indie rock's foremost moan-
ers - Dan Bejar and Spencer Krug 
- would be at the helm of new 
Pitchfork supergroup Swan Lake. 
Curiously enough, Swan Lake is one 
of many projects that both Krug and 
Bejar have undertaken in the past 
few years. Bejar plays a major role 
in the Canadian collective The New 
Pornographers. while Krug spends 
his time gliding between both critic-
and fan -friendly group Wolf Parade 
and Sunset Rubdown. With so many 
musical commitments, it makes one 
wonder how they found the time to 
make the rich and compelling album 
that is Beast Moans . 

Reminiscent of The Decemberists' 
Colin Meloy, Bejar provides passion-
ate sea-chanty vocals for the opener, 

Tom Waits 
• Orphans 
ANn 

****~ 
~ WAITS, from page 14 
do can 'also humble himself to bang-
ing age-old patterns into the drum 
set (or rather, let his son Casey do so 
on "Lowdown") and writing political 
anthems with screaming electric guitar 
riffs and direct Bush bashes ("Road to 
Peace"). 

Most of the unearthed recordings 
of old - ·Some of the tapes I had to 
pay ransoni for to a plumber in Russia; 
Waits wrote - show up on the set's 
second and third discs. Bawlers revis-
its Waits' booze days, when his voice 
dampened to the point of legibility and 
dripped over pluckety island strings 
or his Signature moky-lounge piano. 
And while covers like the tragic accor-
dion blues of "Irene Goodnight" and a 

"Widow's Walk:' But electronic blips 
and echoed harmonies fracture Bejar's 
vocal domination, forcing the listener 
to focus as a stable pop song unrav-
els right in front of him. "All Fires" 
sounds like a softer moment on Sunset 
Rubdown's Shut Up I Am Dreaming 
- until an oscillating guitar pierces 
the track, crescendoing from ear to ear 
and turning Krug's familiar sound into 
something ambiguous and universal. 

Carey Mercer (of Frog Eyes) 
rounds out the group, prOViding raw 
and frantic song structures that are as 
diverse as they are disordered. With 
the power of three songwriters, Swan 
Lake manages to entertain while it 
intrigues, an admirable and seldom-
achieved accomplishment. 

- Jesse Kivd 
STAFF WR ITER 

deathbed reworking of the Ramones' 
"Danny Boy" are enough to earn him 
the throne of Hades, it is on Bastards 
that Waits is most at home. 

Using nothing but larynx-less 
scratches ripped from a tortured throat, 
he can tiptoe-creep through the rafters, 
rifle through the fish market waste pile 
and catfight with lions. His past throw-
aways have been transformed into the 
closest Waits wiU ever come to a great-
est-hits album, his outtakes pigeonhol-
ing those along-the-way details that 
make him so wonderful. 

With a flea market this precious 
available to every kid with $30, Waits 
can't hope to long stay hidden out by 
the railroad tracks, hand-in-hand with 
the outsider anthems that define him.

Tritons Keep Bulldogs • In Check 
Men's club hockey 
team pummels Fresno 
State University in 
10-4 rout to win its 
fourth straight match. 

By Mlltt Croskey 
STAFF WRITER 

It didn't take long for the UCSD 
men's ice hockey.team to freeze out 
Fresno State University at its Nov_ 
L7 home game at Ice Town in UTC 
mall, LO-4_ 

After the opening faceoff, it only 
took the Tritons 39 seconds to get 
their first goal of the game. 

'We came out hard and put 
Fresno State on their heels by scor-
ing early and kept it up by scor-
ing again qUickly," senior co-captain 
and forward Charlie Blake said. 

The second goal came only two 
minutes later, when sophomore for-
ward Ken Yamashita beat the hap-
less Bulldog goalie glove-Side with 
a slap shot from near the blue line. 
The puck banked off the right cor-
ner pole and ricocheted in for a 2-0 
Triton lead. 

The Bulldogs made good on their 
name, fighting back to tie the game 
2-2, but the second goal resulted in 
some controversy. 

"They shot the puck from behind 
the net and it gOI stuck and sLipped 
through a hole at the bottom of the 
net," senior assistant captain and 
defenseman Jesse Tenenbaum said. 
"Everyone around knew it hadn't 
gone in, but there was only one ref 
to look at it and he was on the oppo-
site side and he thought it went in." 

UCSD was called for two pen-
alties in a five-minute span after 
the debacle, giving Fresno State 
the opportunity to take the lead_ 
However, the Triton defense tight-
ened up and warded off the Bulldog 
attack without any damage. 

Sophomore forward Alex Azuma 
came out of the penalty box with 
vengeance and aided freshman for-
ward Michael Frederick in putting 
the Tritons up 3-2 at the L4 min-

ute, 22 second mark of the second 
period_ Frederick flipped it by the 
Bulldog goaltender on the glove-
side for the goal. 

The teams were quiet the next 
few minutes, exchanging shots and 
playing solid defense, until the 
Tritons found themselves with a 
golden opportunity as the puck was 
being slapped around right in front 
of the Fresno State goal. 

The Bulldog goalie smothered 
the puck, and after some pushing 
by both teams, officials had to break 
up a small fight, and senior forward 
Sasan Sharifi along with a Fresno 
State player were sent to the penalty 
box for a two-minute cooldown. 

According to Blake, the four-on-
four played to the Tritons' advan -
tage. 

"We have fast players and the 
four-on-four opens up ice," Blake 
said. "Fresno State had a short bench 
and it gave us a good opportunity_" 

The Tritons took fuJI advantage 
of that opportunity, as Frederick 
stole the puck and raced down the · 
rink with only the goalie to beat. He 
cut right and beat the Fresno State 
goalie glove-Side for a 4-2 lead_ 

The Tritons scored once more 
during the four-on-four on a break-
away by freshman forward Collin 
Smith_ Smith took the pass from 
sophomore defenseman Jeff Ponton 
off a Fresno State turnover and 
flipped it past the Bulldog goal 
tender on the glove-side to extend 
UCSD's lead to three goals. 

Considering Fresno State's ear-
lier comeback from a two-goal defi-
cit, Blake was happy to extend the 
Tritons' margin. 

"A two-goal lead is a false sense 
of comfort and that third goal is 
nice to have," -Blake ·said. "If a team 
scores two quick ones, you still have 
a one-goal lead." 

With 7:39 left in the second peri-
od, Frederick was called for hook-
ing, and it only took Fresno State 29 
seconds into the power play to cut 
UCSD's lead to 5-3. 

After serving hi.s time in the

UCSD Pulls Off Two Ups·ets Equestrian Team Posts 
High Marks in Pomona By Joe T evdowitz SENIOR STAff WRITER 

Following a tough loss at 
Division-I neighbor San Diego 
State University and a disappoint-
ing double-overtime defeat at Grand 
Canyon University to start its reg-
ular season 0-2, the UCSD men's 
basketball team responded impres-
sively at Seattle Pacific University's 
Falcon Las Vegas Thanksgiving 
Tournament, upsetting two top-five 
teams over the Thanksgiving holi-
day weekend. _ 

The Tritons handled No. 4 
Seattle Pacific University with a 
62-52 victory in their tint game 
on Nov_ 24, and then carried their 
momentum into the foUowing day 
by securing a 6L-60 win over No.2 
University of Montevallo. The victo-
ries improved the Tritons' record to 
2-2 and accounted for the first back-
to-back wins over ranked opponents 
since the Tritons ·made the move to 
Division II.

For most riders, sacrifice and 
dedication are words they learned 
early on in order to pursue their 
love of the horseback riding. As 
each moved away to college, this 
desire led them to become a part of 
the UCSD equestrian team, which 
continues to foster the riders' pas-
sion and ability. 

The 30 members compete in 
the Intercollegiate Horse Show 
Association against nine other 
schools in th~ region, including the 
University of San Diego, University 
of Southern California and UCLA, 
and UCSD has consistently been a 
leader in the field of stalwart com-
petitors. 

"The Southern California region 
is extremely competitive," junior 
captain Laur. Erickson said. "But 
this season ou r team· outclasses all 
the other teams In their support for 
each other, their con.ider.tion for 
competitors, respect for leadership." 

The competition. are broken up 
into two different types of show-
manship: Western and English, 
which Is also known u Hunt Seat. 
In Western, a slower and more col-
lected .tyle than EnaIiah, hone and 

and other tasks. 
The English style is faster-paced, 

and involves jumping over fences 
while keeping a rhythm in flats and 
through transitions between gates. 

The main idea of both styles is 
to make it aLI look easy and natural 
to the judges, but a huge challenge 
arises in IHSA's way of promoting 
fairness and cutting costs. Riders 
draw a random horse supplied by 
the host school, and to ride success-
fully at shows, a rider must maintain 
control and perform with an unfa-
miliar animal. 

"The horses tearns use are com-
petition-ready, and [ was mostly 
used to horses [that were I not 
fully trained," sophomore Megan 
Glanville said. "I had never rid-
den a horse that responds to vocal 
commands, so getting used to such 
sensitive animals has been a big 
adjustment." 

To .ddress these adjustments, 
the equestrians must make a 15-
minute trip to the Del Mar stables 
for a three-hour practice, which 
supplement the lessons they must 
pay for on their own. They are only

himself on his next shift. cutting 
through the middle of the Bulldog 
defense, receiving a pass from 
behind the net off of freshman cen-

it between the Fresno State goalie's 
legs to make the score 6-3. 

"It was [Frederick's) first hat

Frederick scored his fourth goaJ

After the Falcons retook the lead 
with 38 seconds left on a jumper by 
Greg Brown, UCSD caJIed a time-
out. After the huddle, the Tritons 
stayed true to their patient offense 
and worked the baJJ around for one 
last shot. Despite having cooled off 
from the first half and scoring only 
four points in the second half, Allard 

. would be given a final opportunity. 
and he nailed a jumper with five 
seconds remaining to give UCSD the 
one-point win. 

"Robby [Peters) drove and drew 
two defends, then passed it to me 
and I dribbled to the open area to my 
left and was able to get it off clean 
before the shot clock expired; Allard 
said. "It felt good to be able to deliver 
the win that the whole team worked 
for and truly deserved." 

Allard led the team with 26 
points in a performance that helped 
him earn CCAA Player of the Week

two minutes early in the first half. 
the FaJcons would never again find 
themselves on top. as the Tritons 
held on for the LO-point upset. 

Lawlor led the team "with 15

from three-pOint range. grabbing 
six rebounds in the process. 

·BasicaJJy in our offense. I just 
let the game come to me." Lawlor 
said about his performance. which 
was only one point shy of his career 
high. "Kelvin [Kim) and Clint 
[Allard) gave me a lot of opportu-
nities to put the ball in the basket 
and J did what [ had to Ito) convert
