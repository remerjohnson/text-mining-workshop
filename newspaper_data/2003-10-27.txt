UCSD grad student wins 

Collegiate Inventors Comp 
Jamie Lmk a UCSD graduate student m the 

department of chemistry and blochemisuy, was 
awarded a $50,000 grand pnze from the 
Collegiate Inventors Competition on Oct 23. 
The competition was sponsored by the National 
Inventors Hall of Fame In N€V.' York. 

lin was awarded he pnze for her Invention 
of a ·smart dust" compnsed of dust -sIzed silicon 
chips that allow SCIentists to rapidly detect a 
Wide vanety of biological and chemical agents. 
The applications of her smart dust involve 
detecting possible terrorist attacks Involving sub-
stances In the air or In dnnking water. 

Her adviser, Michael Sailor, a professor of 
chemistry and biochemistry, was also award-
ed ~ 1 0,000 for his role In he development of 
the smart dust. 

According to Lm she made her discovery 
by aCCIdentally brea Ing a piece of silicon. She 
saw that each piece retained the properties of 
he anginal. She painted particles a specific 

color and programmed them to find particular 
substances such as a toxin. These particles 
would then congregate to form a spot of color 
to mark the pollutant. 

Link's invention has been found to have a 
variety of applications, Including those in med-
Ical diagnostics and research and enVIronmen-
tal research. Potential commeraal applications 
include performmg rapid biochemical assays, 
testing air and water for toxic chemicals, and 
screening chemicals for potential n€V.' drugs.

Advocates to be 
retained at hearings 

Watson responds to A.S. plea 
for student representation 

By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

Univer ity officials have given 
preliminary approval to revisions in 
UCSD's Srudent Conduct Code 
that would allow non-attorney stu-
dent aJvocates to repre ent stu· 
dents at judicial hearings. 

A previous version of the docu-
ment that would have eliminated 
representation of all kinds was 
trongly denounced by the A.S. 

Council in an Oct. 8 resolution. 
" I n response to the concerns 

and recommenda tions of stu· 
dents, the proposed regulations 
have been revised to permit repre-
sentation at hearings by a pool of 
tr dined srudent advocales ," Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Watson wrote in an 
Oct. 20 lerter to the A.S. Council 
and Graduate Student Association 
presidents . 

Under the revisions, rudents 
accused of misconduct can elect to 
be directly represented by a trained 
student advocate. 

"I'm really glad we were able to 
gel this done and that students are 
continuing to be represented in 
non-academic and academic trials," 
A.. President jeremy Paul 
Gallagher said. 

Representation was initially 
removed from the Student 
Conduct Code after a review by 
the UC Office of the General 
Counsel determined that the uni· 

versity cannot differentiate 
between anorney and non -attor-
ney representation. 

To comply with this ruling, 
Director of Student Policies and 
judicial Affairs Nicholas 
Aguilar eliminated non· attorney 
representation on the grounds 
that a ban on attorney representa-
tion had been in place for over 
th ree years. 

According to A.S. 
Commis ioner of Student 
Advocacy jeff Boyd, the new docu· 
men! avoids differentiating 
between attorneys and non -attor-
neys and relies on trained student 
advocates that are technically uni -
versi ly officials when employed 
through the A.S. tudent 
Advocacy Office. 

Aguilar, who was involved with 
receivi ng the Office of the 
General Council's approval for thc 
most recent version of the code, 
placed emphasis on the education-
al experience that judiCial pro-
ceedings provide student advo-
cates . 

" I was able to convince the 
Office of the General Counsel that 
we could distinguish allowing a 
srudent advocate to represent stu-
dents because [the advocates) were 
coming from a program that is a 
campus program that provides an 
important development experience 
for UCSD srudent advocates,"

Vigil protests human rights violations 
VSA among orgs present in demonstration 

By WINNIE CHAN 
Staff Writer 

San Diego youth activists, 
including UCSD's Vi etnamese 

rudent Association and various 
commumty organizations. gath. 
ered behind Linda Vista library on 
Oct. 24 to protest recent human 
rights violations and oppression of 
religious leaders in Vietnam. The 
demonstration included petition-
signing. speeches. a slide show and 
a candlelight vigil. 

"I n the past two wecks, the 
Vietnamese government has 
begun a crackdown on the Unified 
Buddhist Church of Vietnam," 
said Natalie Nguyen, an executive 
board member of the VSA, which 
branches out to nine colleges, 
including UCSD. "The govern-
ment outlawed it and put on a dif-
ferent Buddhist church that is 
government-sponsored and state· 
controlled. " 

David Nguyen, UCSD alumni 
and Vietnam Buddhist Youth 
Association member, said that the 
Vietnamese government was tak-
ing away human rights. 

"The communist government 
in Vietnam took the freedom of 
religion away." he said. 

According to press releases, the 
leaders of the UBCV have been 
arrested and detained in isolation. 

"lbe leaders of the UBCV are 
in two years of house arrest 
because they are seen as a threat 
to the government," Natalie 
Nguyen said. "[The government! 
is a&aid that they're going to 
orchestrate 2nd overthrow the 
government. " 

However, UCSD VSA mem-

David Ung/Cuordion 
Vigilant Members of the San Diego Vietnamese community, indudng UCSD's 
Vietnamese Student Association, protested the impnsonment of monks. 
ber Aimee Vu said that she thinks 
"the government has an agenda." 

"BBC news said that the 
monks were contriving against 
the government," she said . "I 
think the Vietnamcse government 
is trying to go after this radical 
church using di fferent methods. 
It's a way to silence anyone who 
opposes them. The UBCV has 
been under a watchful eye for 
years and now they're being pun-
ished." 

Some of the monks are on 
hunger strikes to protest their 
government's actions. 

"We have the candlelight vigil 
to pray for these monks thar are 
going on hunger strike - to pray 
for their well being," aulie 
Nguyen said. 

The Vietnamese monks are not 
the only people that have gone on 
hunger strikes to prote t the gov-
ernment's actions. Last week in 
Orange COUJlty, five U SD V A 

members went on a 24·hour 
hunger strike to voice their oppo-

It's been about a year si nce the 
one-rate plan was installed. T he plan 
eliminated the lower pnces econd-
year tudents usually paid, instead

one on campus a meal plan and

unjust to enforce on those who had 
won the on-campus housing lottery. 

orne even withdrew their decision 
to live on campus. 

However, there are definite ben -
efits of the Housing and Dining 

e(VIce' plan. It make It ea ier for 
H& D to provide better service and 
options while ultimately enhancing 
the quality of life for both first- and 
econd-year students. 

It all comes down to the money. 
The heart of the matter is, most 
people don't like the idea of being 
told where their money has to go. 
And of all populations, college-
aged kids don't like being told what 
to do. Thus, a plan combining both 
of these no-no's inevitably will 
draw backlash. Students probably 
forget that this extra money they're 
paying is actually for services from 
which they will benefit. 

The one-rate deal requires a

TUilion increases were bad 
enough. 

cverthele~s, It'S one thmg to 
hold students respon Ible fo r 2 
tuiuon fec; It 's quite another to dlc-
tatc how tho e same student 
choo~e to trea t thei r d ic ts and 
cssenoally give oneself a mo nopoly 
over the food market. But appar-

points. True, a lot of the food in the 
dining halls is expensive, but it's bal-
anced our by an array of surprisingly 
low-priced fare; burgers and pasta 
are less than $2 at most H&OS loca-
tions. The same people who com-
plain about the supposedly outra-
geous prices are also the ame people 
who whine about not being able to 
spend all their meal points by the 
end of the year because they've been 
avoiding the high prices. 

The issue is more than just meal 
points. Students living in apartments 
and residence halls receive weekly 
and daily cleaning, respectively. It's 

refres~ng to come home to a dean 
apartment after the weekly accumu-
lation of dust, food particles and 
general filth that compiles in typical 
college habitats. The money that 
students have to fork over actually 
goes toward such amenities, in addi -
tion to the free Ethernet, cable and 
convenience factor. 

peaking of convenience, being 
able to grab a bite in any dining hall 
during the day is a lot easier than 
having to go off campus and buy 
food to cook in the kitchens. 
Granted, this is what students were 
doing until last year, but the ability 
to eat on the run is something that 
should be truly appreciated. The 
amount of meal points wasn't exces-
sive, so you shouldn't feel obligated 
to eat at a cafeteria every meal . 

The kitchens still could be used 

for gatherings and times when you 
just don't want to eat any more 
Canyon Vista food. tudents who 
don't want to eat in dining halls can 
just use points to pick up iflgredients 
in dining halls that they can modify, 
such as vegetables, salad greens and 
grilled chicken breasts. As for the 
usage of extra points, many off-cam-
pus students who previously hated 

PRO 
campus food often develop a 
strangely udden penchant for Plaza 
Cafe's specialties when their friend 
has the meal points to swipe them. 
The admittedly high- priced but 
convenient commodities at Earl' 
Place are another option for spend-
ing meal points. 

For vegans and vegetarians, it 
may be a bit more difficult. 
However, most dining ha lls are 
stock.ed with salad bars and vegetar-
ian choices. In fact, Sierra Summit 
has a daily station devoted to strict-
ly vegetarian fare. [ts not a four star 
restaurant, but it's pretty dam good

Currently, first -year stu-

a slight divergence from the 

previous three- tier policy, in 
which students could purchase 

various amounts of dining

Hardly. 

UCSD estimates the cost of 
room and board for a student living 
at home to be about 52,563 . But for 
a student living on campus who 
eats cafeteria food, the cost more 
than triples, jumping to a whop-
ping $8,620. 

It's not hard to see why it's 
ridiculously easy to run out of din-
ing dollars very quickly in a variety 
of ways. If you require a lot of calo-
ries and need to eat three meals a 
day, for example, you're likely to 
discover early on that $55 a week 
amounts to a spending limit of

The disparity is not due entire-
ly to a faulty meal plan, but for a 
college student paying upward of 
$18,000 per year for a public edu-
cation, each dollar counts. UCSO 
also estimates that meal points 
will last a student roughly until 
the end of the winter quarter. 
Should a student choose to pur-
chase more, he or she will theo-
retically end up shelling out a 
total of about 52,700 on food for 
eight months. 

Who benefits from this? Well, 
it's not the Food Co-op or any of

students to pay for meal points is 
exceptionally easy way to garner a 
large amount of money: roughly 
6,000 new students enter UCSD 
each year and all pay their dues to 
H&O . 

By making the meal points 
non-refundable (and even pro -

ensures its ab olute control ove r

MOst days, the pleasant young Russian fellow wi ll stop by the coffee shop 
where I work for an espresso. He 
i absolutely adored by all the 
employees . When he comes in, 
everyone smiles and tries to have 
his drink ready before he pays. 
Initially, I thought it must be the 
typical love of foreign accents and 
foreigners in general. However, 
upon repeated observance, it 
became obvious that it was merely 
becau e he is s much nicer than 
the hundreds of extremely 
dcmandi ng, uptight caffeine guz-
zlers that precede him every day. 

However, he never goes out of 
his way to be pleasant and he never 
really engages III conver ation 
beyond pleasantries. What makes 
him stand out against the dro'lcs? 

Simply put, he knows his man-
ners. Each time he approaches the 
counter, he smiles and greets the 
employees. Whe n his drink is 
ready, he thanks us and wishes us 
the best for the day. This never 
requires a huge effort, but it means 
a world of difference in terms of 
how peopl e view his presencc. 

nfortunately, thi is acnl3l1y a 
very disturbing discovery, becau e it 
means that etiquette is so depl eted 
that when someone acrually 
exhibi the slllall est bit of decency, 
it comes across as extremely fri end-
ly, rather tllan d te no rm. 

It would be too difficult to try 
to classify Americans in general as 
rude or polite, because then we 
would have to be classified against 
other cultures, where the ru les of 
etiquette arc different. However, 
it can be said that within our soci-
ety, particularly at universities, 
there is a huge lack of basic man-
ners and politeness. 

At UCSD, general rudeness

and take notes, but they use the 
worst possible verbal method: the 
strained voice that tries to sound 
like a whisper, but clearly the 
voice's owner has no real intention 
of speaking any ofter than she 
would at their parties. This funda -
mental disregard for everyone 
around them as well as the profes-
sor is, quite frankly, staggering. 

Worst of all can be easi ly 
observed from near-
ly every type of stu-
dent. No one seems 
to be much better 
than the others. 
Some of the more 
obvious, however, 
include brochure 
disrri butors on

These people are 
by far the rudest 
of the students. 
Due possibly to politeness. /I 

know them and you are probably 
in a hurry. 

There are acquaintances I 
wouldn't walk to class with if r 
were in a hurry because there is no 
time to actually converse. Why 
would I want to make a ' new' 
friend whose sol e reason for 
accompanying me is to recruit me 
to his or her cause? With only 10 
minutes to walk from York to 
\Varren Lecture I fall , it's rude to 
expect the full anemion of some-
one who you don 't know and don't 
care about - as long a they ign 
your petition or club charter. 

There is also, of course, the 
tired and genera lized, but 
resoundingly accurate cliche of 
loud sorority girls si tting behind 
you in lec ture. [c's bad enough that 
they jabber on fo rever about the 

their over-
whelming desire to succeed in 
school, they have never developed 
any social skills, much less a notion 
of manners. They are often shy, but 
aware of their intelligence, and 
thus come across as both inept and 
yet ridiculously smug. 

There are many reasons for 
lack of basic manners. One obvi-
ous reason is that students were 
not taught the words "please" and 
"thank you" when they were 
younger. 

This is not the fault of the tu-
dent; however, if we plan on being 
competent adults, it would be wi e 
to start learning now to appreciate 
those around us. UnfortUnately, 
the university doesn 't embrace this 
at all . n campus, s tuden tS have no 
need o f basic manners because the 
universi ty system, when governing 

our lives in l(}Co pl1rmtir, actually 
encourages confomnity to the uni -
versity bubble, which is a far cry 
from the reality of life. Our world 
consists of studying in ide this bub-
ble. If the only interactions we 
make are either to ask a question 
during lecture or asking for ano th-
cr beer at a party, there is clearly no 
room for etiquette, and smdcn ts 
exemplify this. 

Many will say that etiquette is a 
relative and pointless convention 
- a product of a stuffy society. 
When many think of manners, 
they think placing the fork and 
spoon on the correct side of th e 
plate. This is indeed stuffy, and 
though it would be useful fo r 
everyone to know how to do this, 
it would be much better if students 
could merely remember to say 
"I'm fine" when you ask how they 
are doing, rather than staring 
blankly and moving on. nd while 
it is a convention limited to our 
American culture, which is a very 
vague notion itself, it is the mall 
pleasantries that can make another 
person's day turn around for th e 
better. 

When society speaks of ran -
dom acts of kindness and bei n g 
nice to fellow human bei ngs, it 
doesn 't require saving someone 's 
life or giving them all your money. 

While those are indeed "nice" 
acts, it would be better if we fi r t 
could learn to be polite on even 
the smallest leve l. h 's a shame that 
so many of us are incapable of 
even this small fo rm of respect fo r 
each o ther.

respond to the gross misrepresen-
tation of the U nited Food & 
Commercial Workers' strike that 
appeared in the [Oct. 20J issue. 
Firs t , the characte rizations of 
unions as beholden to the mafia 
and of the grocery workers as si m-
ply "swiping items across a barcode 
reader" are si mply false and ridicu-
lous. Grocery store workers do a 
number of jobs, including some of 
which are very physically arduous. 
U n ions in general represent th e 
needs of the ir mem ber worke rs and 
are a necessary counter to the whim 
of business owners, who will cut 
co sts whenever possi bl e at the 
expense of wo rkers. 

It is true that UFCW workers 
do n ot currently pa y for healthcare. 
T his is the result of years of battles 
with employers who, regardless of 
th eir complaints now of lower 
profit, are still making billions of 
do ll ars each year on the basis of the 
ha rd work done by the 70,000 
employees in So uthern Califo rnia

offered by ons, A1bertsons and 
Ralphs to their employees not only 
requi res them to pay premiums fo r

THE U 0 GUARDIAN MONDAY, ocrOBER Z7, Z003 

The call for a crusade leads to a 
dangerous societal situation 

By BRIAN UIGA 
Contributing Writer 

The problem with evil is that it 
doesn't have a convenient frame of 
reference. everm ind the 16th 
century Eu ropean witch trials, 
where you were forced to pay for 
your own torture, or the modern-
day example of overzealous preach-
e rs who exclaim loudly that "God 
hates fags," a convenient three-
word phrase which provides the 
limit of their vocabulary. No, the 
modern conception of evil is a bit 
narrow-minded, whittled down to a 
single image: a diminutive fellow 
by the name of Adolf who tried and 
failed to systematically destroy a 
population of people during the 
194<ls. 

Interestingly enough, despite 
these incredibly narrow visions of 
evil, Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Moluamad has managed 
to hit them squarely on the nose 
and spark the maximum possible 
amount of controversy across the 
globe. Many want to kill him, and 
many want to kill for him. 

As the leaders of 57 nations lis-
tened at the Organization of 
Islamic Conference, Mahathir 
laced assertions of Jewish world 
dominance into a speech calling for 
Islamic forces to unite against their 
oppressors, even at one point s~t­
ing that "1.3 billion Muslims can-
not be defeated by a few million 
Jews. There must be a way." But 
Mahathir's most surprising s~te­
ment of the evening was a combi-
nation of cry for solidarity and an 
eerie recollection of evil incarnate, 
Hilter: "1.3 billion people cannot 
be simply wiped out. The 
Europeans killed six million Jews 
out of 12 million . But today the 
Jews rule this world by proxy. They 
get others to fight and die for 
them." 

This statement can be taken two 
ways. One interpretation is that like 
the Jews, Muslims can rise to power 
because of sheer numbers . But, 
when combined with his other anti-
Jewish sentiments, Mahathir's 
statement takes on a much more 
sinister tone: that despite Hitler's 
best efforts, Jews still hold too 
much power. 

In the flurry of publicity that 
followed, M3lathir wa unrepen-
tant, saying, "Why i it that when 
people condemn Muslims, the 
European UOIon does not try to ay 
anything'" 

He followed his question with 
an affirmation that the violent reac-

tion to his peech proves that, in 
fact, Jews do rule the world. 

But even if he wasn't misquoted, 
does recalling Hitler really consti-
tute evi l? 

Local succubu Bryan Barton 
takes every chance he can to name-
drop the Fuhrer when there is a 
reporter around; does this mean 
that UCSD is home to the greatest 
evil in San Diego County? Of 
course not. For all of his posturing, 
the sniveling Barton has only used 
the Hitleresque ideal to add con-
troversy to his arguments. 

Mahathir takes the macho pos-
turing one step further by stating 
that Hitler's efforts were noble, but 
they were not completed. This is 

" Evil belongs to the acts that members of these 
races, sexes and religions 
take it upon tltsemselves 

to commit .,.," 

not a small matter of accepting 
Hitler for his elcellence in rallying 
and organization, a belief innocu-
ously held by our governor-elect. 
No, this is the big one. The burn-
ing bodies and genocide one. This 
is the belief that has the capability, 
if mixed with a large dose of politi -
cal power and a nuke or twO, to 
bring on the Apocalypse (or any 
other religious term you choose to 
represent the Big Bleed). 

But why are we bothering 
Mahathir so much for his words? 
All leaders who are religiously affil -
iated are bound to feel some fervor 
and passion now and then. 

After all, look at passionate 
evangelists all over the world, try-
ing their best to convert the hea-
thens to their "correct" form of 
thought. It only seems fair that if 
one of these well - meaning, holy-
wishing fellows enters a place of 
power, that they will continue their 
good work for any God they deem 
appropriate. For example, one 
would be hard pressed to say that it 
was simply a slip of the tongue 
when President George W. Bu h 
called the war on Iraq a "crusade." 

But this is the first time that any-
one in such a position of power has 
publicly stated that the time ha · 
come for another of AdoIrs holy 
cJeansings. No matter how much the

leaders of any number of countries 
with disputcd territory in the Middle 
East pray for completc annihilation 
of the enemy so that they can finally 
have thei r Holy Land back from the 
infidels, nobody so far has becn quite 
desperate enough to come out and 
say it as explic itly as our friend 
Mahathir. 

Yet now that we have estab-
lished Mahathir as a genuine 
threat, we must not completely 
demonize him. A statement, even 
an inflammatory one such as the 
utterance of Mahathir Mohamad, 
means nothing without the proper 
context. Not that the phrase was 
taken out of context in the speech, 
however. Anyone who reads the full 
text of Mahathir's speech will see 
that his claims of being quoted out 
of context are nothing short of 
utter balderdash . 

No, the impor~nt context here 
lies in the entire point of the 
offending speech, that currently 
Muslims are facing hardship the 
likes of which have never been seen 
since the crusades of King Richard . 
The Islamic powers are entrenched 
in a bitter stalemate over Palestine, 
their countries are being invaded 
and singled out by "European" 
power-s, and their forces are being 
torn apart by internal squabbling 
between various sects. It's a time of 
great desperation. 

When faced with similar circum-
s~nces at the end of Wo rld War I 
(or, as we labeled it in our idiocy, 
"The War to End All Wars"), the 
German people were easily rallied 
by a loud leader who offered a con-
venient scapegoat to their problems. 
Well , now Mahathir has found not 
only a convenient scapegoat in the 
Jews again, but called them a gen-
uine threat to their way of life. Its 
Hitler squared. Mahathir may not 
be the one who will lead the great 
conflict, but his words have opened 
the door for the next powerful 
speaker who could . It is now the 
responsibility of the world commu-
nity to defuse this bomb before it 
kills us all . 

Evil belongs to no race, no sex, 
no religion. Evil belongs to the acts 
that members of these races, sexes 
and religions take it upon them-
selves to commit. 

And Mahathir Mohamad, bless 
his heart, ha made it that much 
easier for these acts to occur by 
vocalizing his dcspcraoons during 
uch a high -profile con ference . 

Brace yourself, chi ldren, o ne or tWO 
more speeches and we may havc a 
Holy War.

Comments deserving of harsh rebuking 
Sensitivity required for all backgrounds 

Union: Both 
sides need to 

be understood By SOFIA MARIN 
Contributing Writer 

"The Asians are killing our 
tour. Absolutely killing it - their 
la k of emotion, their refusal to 
speak E ng li sh when they ca n 
speak Engl ish ," said professiona l 
golfer Jan Stephenson in an inter-
view for Golf Magazine's 
November issue. 

This sort of remark is sure to 
have received vas t media cover-
age as we ll as public outrage, 
right? Wron g. Tn fact, seve ral 
prejudiced comments like these 
made by Stephenson rece ived 
relative ly little scrutiny and hard-
ly any med ia a ttention. Unjust 
generalizations of the Asian race 
and culture made by thi s long-
-ime professional female golfer 
were ultimately ignored . 
Shocki ng. 

Stephenson had no hesitation 
in sharing her ever-perceptive 
observations. "Our tour is pre-
dominantly interna tional and the 
majority of them are Asian. 
They've taken it over." Taken 
over, eh? It looks like someone 
fee ls a bit threatened. Of the top 
six players on the money list last 
week, four were Asian . But 
according to Stephenson, Asians 
are "ki llin g" the Ladies 
Professional Golf Assocation tour. 
Perhaps someone ought to men-
tion to Stephenson that, in reality, 
accord ing to the LPGA commis-
sioner Ty Votaw, "attendance, TV 
viewership, Web site traffic and 
purses are up." 

Asians are not damaging 
women's golf - they are making 
it remarkably better. Se Ri Pak is 
just one example of a successful 
and beneficial Asian player on the 

LPGA. She has claimed several 
victories including McDonald's 
LPGA Championship and the 
U.S. Women's Open . 

Stephenson argued that to 
increase publicity of the LPGA 
tOur, women need to "promote sex 
appeal. It's a fact oflife." Since when 
is promoting sex appeal a fact of 
life? Stephenson's attempt to invali-
date the entire women~ movement 
i another issue 31 together. 

Rush Limbaugh's arguabl y 
racist statements about the media's 
coverage of black athletes such as 

" 

John D. Skrenmy, a sociology 
professor at UCS D offers one 
legitimate explanation regarding 
the nonresponsive ness of the 
media and the people to the dis-
criminatory comments made by 
Stephenson. 

"Because S(fm t Asian Americans 
have done well in university and 
professional school ad missions, 
and have generated high incomes 
as a result, many, and perhaps 
most, Americans view Asian 
Americans as a group that has 
done well and does not face dis-

Donovan 
McNabb were 
fiercely criti-
cized while 
Stephenson's Asians are not damaging 

c rimination ," 
Stephenson said. 
"They therefore 
do not respond to 
cr iticism of this 
group as they do 
when someone in 
the media cri ti-
eizes or says 
something racist 
about African 

comme nts on 'll.{ the 
Asia ns went womens gOj- yare 
largely unchal - making it remarkably 
lenged . T here 
must be some better. " 
explana rio n for 
this. 

Such discriminatory comments 
made by Stephenson must have 
obviously received some SOrt of 
punishment, right? Wrong agai n. 
After a few words of rebuke from 
Votaw, Stephenson apologized. 
But that's all . Life continued as 
usual and she played in her tourna· 
ment that very weekend. 

Sure, she received some criti-
cism from other golfers, but that 
is not enough. There were no 
major news headlines, no specials 
on television. Nothing. 

This sort o f a blind-eye reac· 
tion to blatant bigotry is unac-
cep table. T he reaction to 
Stephenson's statement, or lack 
thereof, might be attiributed to 
cultural and psychologica l 
factors. 

Americans." 
Many Americans simply do not 

expect to see discrimination 
against Asians. Part of the world 
view is that Asians are accepted; 
they are not the target of preju-
dice. If the media fai ls to cover 
such a story or neglects to give 
much attention to discriminatory 
comments like those of 
Stephenson, then it is unlikely that 
people wiII find out about it, let 
alone respond to it. 

Psychological studies can also 
prove helpful in understanding 
the comparatively nonrespon-
siveness of Asians themselves. 
Whe n groups have been mis-
treated and abused ,they can, at 
times, become extremely vigilant 
and sensitive to critici m - natu-
rally. The advantage of this type 

" 

of behavior is that it can protect 
the person from criticism or dis-
crimina tion in the future. 

On the other hand, someone 
who has not suffered high amounts 
of racism or discrimination may not 
be sensitive to it or even recognize 
it as such. Cultural research on 
emotiona l expressiveness has 
shown that certain cultures, such as 
the Asian culture, tend to underem-
phasize the open expression of 
emotion. There is greater value 
placed upon ideas of ha rmony and 
consequently, conflict avoidance. 
This is part of the cultural dynamic 
- it cannot be characterized as 
ei ther positive or negative. 

This may be one factor tha t 
might contribute to why there was 
not a prominent public reaction or 
expression against the commen ts 
of Stephe nson. 

\Nhatever the reason is for those 
statements by Stephenson sliding 
by under the radar, one thing holds 
true. Failure to recognize and 
respond to discrimina tion of this 
son is inexcusa ble. It should not 
matter which group of people are 
discriminated against. Racism is 
racism. Discrimination is discrimi-
nation - regardless of the culture. 

A specific race should not 
determine what is constituted as 
newsworthy and what is not. It is 
not only the job of the people to 
recognize prejudice and its nega-
tive effects, but perhaps more 
importantly, it is the job of the 
media to understand that any 
racism is hamlful racism. \Nhether 
it be against Asians, Caucasians or 
Hispanics, racism must not be 
ignored just because the particular 
culture has not neces arily borne 
the brunt of discrimination in the 
past.

SIO marine physicaJ lab staff

how successful the event wa . 

"It has been very well coordi -
nated ' and everything is really 
alive," Rieder said. "The turnout 
has been really steady. I didn't 
think so many people would 
how up." 

The S[O's celebration marked 
the 100th year anniversary of the 
in titution's establishement on 

ept. 26, 1903 . The open house 
wa one of the many festivities of 
cripps to commemorate its cen-

tennial . 
" It took six year to plan the 

centennial celebration, and we've 
been celebrating all year long," 
said Dora Dalton, a communica-
tions director of the Open House 
Committce at Scripps. "The 
UCSD Open House is a culmina-
tion of our entire celebration." 

Dalton said that UCSD 
played a major role in funding the 
Scri pps' join t open house cele-
bration. 

Chandler said that in past 
years, an open house was not 
always plausible. 

"During the 19905, an open 

house could not be held because 
there was a bad budget," she said. 

Dalton, however, said that an 
event like the UCSD Open House 
is essential to the conununity. 

"It's important because a cell -
telmial celebration happens only 
once," Dalton aid. 

The centennial celebration at 
Scripps featured performances 
by the Running Path Tribal 
Dancers and the Hui ke Aloha 0 
Hula, a hula dance group. Old 
Ford roadsters were exhibited a 
wa tile Ring Tank, which 
Scripps scientists tlse to study 
animal physiology. Other activi-
ties included fish printing and 
pumpkin painting. 

The Ellen Browning Scripps 
Memorial Pier at c ripp was 
open for the public exclusively for 
tile event. Built and completed in 
1988, the pier is used stricdy for 
research. 

Overall, Rieder felt the open 
house was succe sful in its goal of 
celebrating the campus and the 
communi ty. 

"Lots of people helped 
bridge the gap between the 
community and the university," 
she said .

High.-tech 
response to 

• terronsm to 
be developed 

By MARGRET GONZALES 
Contributing Writer 

A new, federally- funded research 
project e tablished at UC D to cus-
tOmize exi ting programs to build a 
wirelcss medical response sy~tel1l for 
mass casualties, was given a three-
year $4.1 million grant frolll the 
National Library of Medicine on 
Oct. 23. 

Ca lled the \Vireless Internet 
Information System for Medical 
Response in Disasters, the program 
\\~II recruit dle participation of local 
San Diego police, firefighters, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
paramedics and other first aid 
response teams to develop the use of 
advanced wireless technology in 
response to mass-casualty disasters. 

"We are in a world where we are 
routinely preparing for the 
unthinkable," wn ARD Project 
Director and Professor of Medicine 
Leslie Lenert said. "Disasters hap-
pen in various scales: the World 
Trade Center, dangerous chemical 
leabges, mall pox and epidemics. 
The goal of wnSARD is to come 
up with an infrastrucnlre to make 
medical assistance possible." 

Under current te hnology, fir t 
responders create an immediate 
scene asses~ment and disa ter com-
mand center. Emcrgency per,onnel 
evaluatc victims. provide Lrcatlllcnt 
and prioriti7.e the patientS. This ~1's­
tcm often overwhelms limited 
resource, according to Lenncrt. 

"We are anticipating many situ-
ations, from victi ms inadl'ern:ntly 
contaminating a hospital aftcr 
exposure, to delays In transporta-
tion," Lenen said. "The curren t 
medical informational technology 
is effective but simplistic. They arc 
based on technology from the 
1960s, 1970s and 1980s, rather 
than the current technology." 

VVIISARD will modifY the cur-
rent technologies in order [ 0 adapt 
for mass-casualty disasters. The pro-
ject will employ radio tags th.at track 
the location of victims and respon-
ders, supply frontline emergency 
responders with handheld personal 
data assistants to generate access to 
pauent medical data, and monitor 
"hot zones," or contaminated areas. 
WIISARD will also send medical 
data from the fields to the ho pitals 
for preparatory guidelines. 

"The federal government real-
ized that the local jurisdiction was 
not prepared for di asters that would 
Create such an overwhelming nwn-
ber of victims who are the initial 
responders," said Metropolitan 
Medical Strike Team Director 
Theodore Chan. "San Diego is the 
first to develop this sort of network. " 

WIlSARD will be ba ed n 
third-generation wireless technolo-
gy, which can provide high-speed 
transmission of real -time medical 
and personal data from local juris-
dictions LO a command center in San 
Diego. PDAs will equip an Active 
First Responder system intended to 
locate "hot zones" so that reslXlI1-

La Jolla Playhouse 
raises needed funds 

UC and union reach agreement 
New UPTE contract includes a raise 

New locale for theater 
under construction 

By EVAN WANG 
Contributing Writer 

After five months of negotia-
tions, the University of 
Ca lifornia has reached an agree-By SHANNON EUOT 

Contributing Writer 

The La ]olla Playhouse has SllC-
cessfully met the Kresge $1 Million 
Grant Challenge and plans to con-
tinue efforts on its Capita l 
Campaign through Dccember 2003. 
Funds acquired from the campaign 
are being used to build a new theater 
complex, as well as promote the arts 
in the San Diego community. 

The $1 million grant is one of the 
largest ever awarded by the Kresge 
Foundation to a nonprofit regional 
theater, La Jolla Playhouse represen-
tatives said. It is also the first ever 
awarded to the La ] olla Playhouse 
from the Kresge Fowldation. 

The Capital Campaign, initiated 
in 1997, has collected $42 million to 
date. By the time of public 
announcement in 1999, $18.5 mil -
lion had been raised; after receiving 
the challenge in September 2002, a 
total of $36.8 million had bee n 
raised. An additional $4.2 million 
was acquired over the next nine 
months. 

After achieving the required $41 
million by the July 2003 deadline, 
the La ]olla Playhouse recently 
received an additional $1 million 
from the Kresge Foundation to aid 
in the accomplishment of three 
main goa ls: raising money for 
annual expenses, supporting an 
endowment, and construction of 
the state-of- the-art Joan and Irwin 
Jacobs Center, cheduled to open 
in the fall of 2004. 

La ] olla Playhouse administra-
tors ate taking particular care in 
creating an endowment, which 
would support the production of 
more plays as well as acting classes 
for youths and adults. Capital 
Campaign Chair Geri Ann Warnke 
sa id "the endowment i the key to 
the theater's future ... it will guar-
antee that the Playhouse can con-
tinue to invest in creating even 
more plays, serving more audiences

Named in recognition of the 
Jacobs family's $5 million donation, 
theJoan and IrwinJacobs Center for 
La]olla Playhouse will house 50,000 
square feet of new theater space, 
administrative offices, rehearsal halls 
and a restaurant and cabaret. 

An additional theater will be 
built, giving the La Jolla 
Playhou e's a total of three. 
Traditionally sharing practice space 
with the UCSD Department of 
Theatre and Dance, the La Jolla 
Playhouse nmv looks forward to 
having its own rehearsal space. 

Alluding to the difficulty of the 
overlap of the two groups' perfor-
mance easons. managing director 
Terry Dwyer said the new buildings 
will "greatly facilitate the sharing of 
space by the two organizations."

ment with the University 
Professional and Technical 
Employees union for a new labor 
contract on Oct. 20. 

"We're pleased that we were 
able to negotiate a salary increase 
at a time [in the economy] when it 
is difficult to offer raises," said 
Ann Skinner, director of human 
resources for UCSD Health Care. 
"It shows that we really value our 
employees." 

Affecting the 2, 100 health care 
professionals employed by the 
University of California, the 
three-year, 46-article contract is 
headlined by annual wage increas-
es, effective retroactively on July I 
of this year. 

Other features include 
improved layoff and severance 
benefits, as well as professional 
development and educational-
leave benefits. 

According to Leslie Franz, 
director of health sciences and 
communications for UCSD 
Health Care, the contrac t affects 
the 246 employees at UCSD' 
Thornton and Hillcrest hospi -
tals. 

These workers will receive a 
1.8 percent salary increase this 
year, followed by a 2 percent raise 
in 2004 and a 3 percent raise in 
2005. 

The university cited hard 
work, respect and professionalism 
as key factors in resolving the con-
tract in "just five months," accord-

EXPOSE YOURSELVES! 
The Guardian would like to extend a special offer to groups who might wont to 
advertise in the campus newspaper but find the associated costs prohibitive. 
The Guardian circulates 22,000 copies to all six campuses each week. Our 
distribution team reports that newspopers are flying off the racks more than ever. 
Increosed readership may be due to new marketing efforts, more fulkolor covers, 
or just improved editorial qual ity. Whatever the reason, we like it. And we want 
campus groups who might be stropped for cash to be able to ride the wave and 
get some exposure . You con announce events, meetings, give props, congratulate 
a colleague, or recruit new members. All these messages can be yours; almost freel 
Introducing, the experimental COUPONS FOR AD SPACE PLAN. 
Many Tr itons consume goods and services all over Son Diego, but the Guardian 

(and our client base) likes it when our 
coupons are used. So here's the plan: 
Get your members 10 save receipts 
whenever they use Guardian coupons. 
Each receipt will be worth $4 when turned 
into the Ad Mgr. to be exchanged each 
Thursdoy for advertising space. Pretty 

simple, huh? Note: Although we ca n create your ad in a pinch, we prefer that you 
toke core of it. 
By the way, if your members are not wild about flame Broiler, Advanced Body 
Core, or any of the other cou pons found in each Monday and Thursday issue, 
Michael will toke requesls for new businesses l The idea here is to increase your 
interaction with our newspaper while giving your group some much-needed visibility. 

SOME DETAILS AIOUT THE PUN 
The amount you spend on a coupon is irrelevant. Just keep your receipt and you 
will earn $4 loward the cost of any display ad up 10 a half pagel 
Certain receipls w ill be assigned 0 higher value. AI Ihis time, the only $6 value 
cou pons are the real estate ods (where you basicolly need to buy a condo or 
someth ing, AND Advanced Body Care (Thurs Coupon page) where you can get 
a professionol (I .hr.) full.body massage right now for $251!1 
By the way, here is a sample pr ice list of our ads so that you know approx how 

many coupon receipts you'll need to earn 0 certain ad size. 
2X3" = $24 (6 receipts) 
4XS" = $80 (20 receipts) 
SX8" = $160 (40 receipts) 
8X10" = $320 (a whole bunch of receipts) 
It might seem like a 101 of spending, however, depending on the consuming habits 
of your group, you can build toward 0 sizable ad quicklyl Also, you can pay a 
little "real" money ond use the receipt plan for the balance if you wish . 
Contact us today to sign yourselves upl 

ing to a press release. 
Negotiations began in March 

and ended when a tentative agree-
ment was made in mid-August. 
Official confirmation was made on 
Oct. 20 when the union voted to 
ratify the contract. 

"We're always glad when 
we're able to achieve a contract 
with our workers," Franz said. 
"The work force is what makes 
our system successful , and when 
they're happy, patient care can 
happen ." 

However, sentiments on the 
UPTE union side varied. 
According to UPTE Systemwide 
President]e1ger Kalmijn, the con-
tract was ratified by a margin of 
three votes with a more than 50 
percent voter turnout. 

"Many of the pay scales at the 
University of California medical 
centers continue to lag behind 
industry standards," Kalmijn said. 
"The pay increases are better than 
those received by campus employ-
ees but not sufficient to meet the 
needs for health care profession-
als. The union will continue to 
push for additional increases to 
meet urgent equity needs starting 
immediately. " 

Prior to voting, UPTE San 
Diego President Eric Paavola sent 
out a letter to union members 
around San Diego urging them to 
vote against ratification, citi ng in 
particular a lack of benefi ts for 
local members. 

The three-year of the con-
tract was not beneficial, Paavola 
noted in the letter, as "UPTE has 
been working toward a contract 
that expires at the same time as 
the nurses ' contract [in two 

years), not a year later. We will 
lose bargaining power if we have 
a three-year contract." 

" I ca n't say that there are 
many new features Ito the new 
contract)," Paavola said. "The 
severance pay does not allow for 
those persons who have a reduc-
tion in time to get severance pay. 
We hould not have left bargain-
ing without it . Severance pay is 
only good if you never plan on 
returning to the university. 
Otherwise, it affects your seniori-
ty and medical benefits upon 
retirement." 

According to Paavola, San 
Diego local employees were at a 
disadvantage in the negotiation 
process due to lack of representa -
tion. 

He saiu that the original uele-
gate was unable to manage her 
work at the office and the time-
consuming bargaining process on 
the side. 

The original delegate stepped 
away from the bargaining table, 
and San Diego union members 
were unable to find a replacement 
before negotiations ended, he 
said. 

"The entire nation continues 
to experience a dearth of health 
ca re professionals and the 
U niversity of California 's uncom-
petitive wages will continue to 
cause severe staffing problems in 
an already overtaxed workforce," 
Kalmijn said. "We continue to 
have grave concerns about the 
quality of health care when 
employees have unrealistic work-
loads, can rarely go on vacation 
and get punished when they call in 
sick."

Advocates: 
New code 
includes 

representation 
continued from page J 

Aguilar said. U And thar was consis-
tent with the mission of the univer-
sity and a sufficient (ilstinction to 
justify limiting the representation 
to student advocates." 

Another change in the code 
requires that student advocates 
receive training from the student 
conduct coordinator and the tu-
dent legal servIces office hefore 
they can represent students at hear-
ings. 

"The ralionale for that is, of 
course, to ensure that we have 
someone who has at least a mini-
mum level of com petency 111 rep-
resenti ng the student at a fo rma l 
heari ng or, for that matter, at the 
informal proce s," Aguilar said . 

Boyd says that training will be 
"similar to 0 udicialJ Board train-
ing, but it's going to be focusi ng a 
lot more on [student advocates'] 
role in the formal heari ng and 
informal resolution process." 

In addition to allowing student 
advocates, the new code includes a 
statute of limitations that requires 
charges be brought within one year 
of an incident. 

The vice chancellor of student 
affairs has the power to make an 
exception to the statute of limita-
tions if "extenuating circum-
stances" exist. 

"We've had this system in place 
before ." and we haven't had any 
complaints. It worked well , it was 
educational," Boyd said in refer-
ence to student representation. 
"Had we not intervened, we would 
have 10 t student representation, 
hands down." 

Before taki ng effect, the new 
regulations mu t be approved by 
the vice chancell or of student 
affai rs and the chancell or. 

"Not many students care about 
[representation by advocates], but 
they care about it when it's a service 
that they need," Boyd said. 
"Hopefully, you'll never need it but 
it's nice to Ienow that it's there when 
the need arises."

Fire: Classes canceled, 
UCSD campus clos d 

continued from ~e I 
Diego city limits have been burned. 

t least II persons have been 
confirmed dead by officials. 

The Cedar Fire, which swept 
southwest along Interstate 15 to 
burn more than 100,000 acres, was 
the closest threat to the UC 0 
campus. The fire affected the near-
by San Diego neighborhood of 
Mira Mesa, Mirama r and 
Clairemollt Mesa among others. At 
one poi nt, officia ls said, the Cedar 
Fire jumped over to the west of 
Interstate 805, but was later "com-
pletely extinguished." Road closures 
included Interstate 15 at Miramar 
Road, Highway 52 at Interstate 163, 
and Highway 52 at Interstate 80S. 

Eileen Callahan, a public infor-
mation officer at UCS D Health 
Care, said three people in serious 
condition and everal more were 
admitted to the U SO 1edical 
Center in Hillcrest during the day 
fo r fire-related burn . 

Q uill said the university was 
taking teps to inform campus resi-
dent about the inlution and how 
evacuation procedures would work 
if official determined such actions 
necessary. n announcement 
regarding the campus' HalUS after 
Oct. 27 will be released later that 
day if necessary, Quill saId. 

Some CSD resident~ ,ecmed 
unconcerned w1th the local fire. 

"I'm not really worned because 
it's pretty far and would have to 
burn through a lOt before it got 
here," John Muir ollege freshman 
Racqucl Ling said. 

San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy 
held a press conference at II a.lI1. to 
urge the public to take proper pre-
cautions during the fires, includ1l1g 
limiting water and de tricity usc. 

"It's very importllnl that people 
do their best to tay calm and stay off 
the roads unless they arc evacuated," 
San Diego Mayor Dick lurph , 
said. "I urge the public to watch TV 
and lislen to dle radio for updat s." 

In a statement made at 5 p.m., 
M.urphy asked an Diego employers 
to close businessc and allow their 
employees to stay home on Oct. 27 
to keep the highways clear for evac-
uees and rescue person.ncl. Murphy 
said that keeping busines es closed 
would help conserve water and ener-
gy, adding that employees were al 0 
safer at home than on the roads. 

Southern Ca lifornia's dry condi-
tions and swirli ng win d have 
caused a host of fires reccntl y, as 
firefighters have worked to con tain 
fires in Rancho Cucamonga, ,an 
Bernardino and rhe amp 
Pendleton Marine Corp base. 

San Diego Fire hief Jeff 
Bowman said dlat 100 firefighters 
were deployed on the morning of 
Oct. 26 to fight dIe area', fires .md 
that hW1l1reds of others were recalled 
from the an Bernardino fires . At 
times, morc than 00 firefighters 
were battling the Ced.lr Fire. 

Bowman attributed dry condi-
tion and Santa Ana winds to the 
fires' rapid spread. 

"Fires create their own wind 
and the brllsh " a fllel that hasn'r 
burned In 20 to 0 years," he said.

smiled .Igain and nodded his head 
til welcome toward the lobby. A DJ 
who had JUSt stepped in from the

back and made a beeline to the 
broad aSt room, eqUlpped with a

Standing in front of the official 
producrion chedule white-era e 
board that even features small

John l uir College lunior Steve 
York pontificated about the mcan-

SRTV, 

"Essentially, we're a good 
re ouree, \I e teach student!> how to

together 3 show," said York, who 
works on a call-in question and 
answcr show named " loan and

Inene" 

Thosc who staff KSDT radio 
and SRTV arc slaves to the broad-
cast media, l1ley'd have to be -
working long hours without pay 
takes some major dedication. 

Both stations are located in 
tudent Center, a place that Shah 

de cribed as quite pr gres-ive on 
an dlcrwi 'e slUffy campus. Both 
broadcast thelT own media, pro-
duce their own shows, are at the 
forefront of college media with 
online bro<ldcast' and run their sta-
tions professionally. And both arc 
v e r y 

poised to inundate UCSD. 
Each station, however, is a 
vcry different animal. 

KSDT is the hip dinosaur of 
rudent Center, primed to make 

the leap from the past into the 
future. J the Lcd Zeppelin and 
Bob Dylan vinyl collections anest, 
the ~tudent-run radio station has 
been around longer than the peo-
ple who run 11 have been alive, It's 
dcfinltely gOt semonty, but in 
K DT' case, seniority means a 
passion to aggreSSively pursue the 
K DT motto, "fiercely indepen-

"This used to be the station that 
broadcasted Chargers games," 
Shah said. "Then, we lost our sig-
nal and things went downhill." 

l ie admits that not only did the 
loss of the frequency on the radio 
dial make listenership and motiva-

a rut that Shah is intent on leading 
his staff of 100-strong out of. 'Inc 
upward climb began with a new 
approach to radio and some new

I COLLEGE SURVIVAL GUIDE 
The cure for homesickness is a dose of good old distraction and fun times 

By VINEESHA MALKANI 
Contributing Writer 

It's halfway into the quarter now 
and all your weird new roommates 
are still spending random evening 
out in the common room bonding 
through a game of Truth or Dare. 

In tead of going out and joining 
them, however, you find your elf 
locked in your room clutching your 
baby blanket and dialing the phone 
number of your be t friend from 
home after pending hours reading 
those oh-so-meani ngful "It's been 
fun, have a nice life" messages in 
your yearbook. 
. You realize that uddenl}' ju t 
fWO weeks of bemg away from 
home is already twO weeks too 
many. You kno~ that you have a 
bad case of homesickness, that 

you're just missing the place where 
you wcre sheltered and babied by 
your parents, who found it crucial 
to ensure that everyone of your 
minuscule wants and de ires were 
met. Whether you're one of the 
fre hmen that jets home right after 
class ends every Friday ince 
\Ve!come \Veek, or one of the one 
who acnlally considers CSD to 
be their home, we all get struck by 
thi di ea e some time. 

"Homesickne s affects first year 
students in different degrees," said 
Reina Juarez, director of 

P ychologi al and Counseling 
Services. "It is normal to yearn for 
home because of the transition and 
realization thai home will never be 
the same again. We only get con-
cerned about it possibly leading to 
depression when after six months a 
student i till finding it hard to 
adapt to college life." 

Here are a few pain-free tips 
on how to rid yourself of thi 
infection in no time.

First, make sure you tay busy. If 

you find yourself wilh too mllch

into trus trap, spend more time 
tudying instead of counting the 

individual floor tiles in the bath-
room. Anytime you miss home, just 
remind yourself why you are away 
from home in the first place: to get 
a good education. 

But of cour e, we can't jll t 
study all the time or wc'lI end lip 
depressed and miss out on lhe 
social life that makes the coll ege 
experience what it is. 

"There are several ways to get 
involved," said Ellen Erenea, 
director of the Sludent 
Organi7.ations and Leadership 
Opporrunites. "UCSD has over 
400 organizations in the S.O.L.O. 
database and the six colleges all 
offer other orgs as well." 

Your oplions include everything 
from Greek Ii fe to religiou clubs 
where you can meet other who 
share your views and hobbies , and 
po sibly become your second fami-
ly. More spirited groups, such as 
TritOn lide, will keep you in a 
cheery mood so you forget all 
about home, or you can kill time on 
the fielo playing on the ultimate 
Frisbee team. 0 matter which 
organizations you find to be right 
for you, your evenings will soon fill 
up with meetings and events so that 
at 7 p.m., instead of daydrealTling 
about that family dinner YOll would 
be having right then, you'll be out 
exploring your interests, finding 
your place at UCSD, and malcing 
new friends. If you really want to 
have a quality family dinner, you 
can always go to McDonald's. 
They love to ee you smile. 

Stop being anti-social 
ew friend are another thing. 

\VIUle you're off at college, away 
from everything and everyone 
fami liar to you, it is vital to have 
great friends you can be yourself 
around. Instead of coming home to 
your family, you open your suite 
door to your roommates and 
friends : your default family. Once 
you've found a few people you know 
you'll be dose to, behave candidly 
and don't be afraid to open up to 
them, just as you would with your 

at home. After all, you're 
Stuck with these people whether or 
not you like it. The more comfort-
able you let yourself feel around 
them, the more you'll feel you can 
depend on them.

homesickness is to avoid going 
home as of len as you may want to. 
If you go home every single week-
end, while you may think you are 
doing your elf a favor by easing 
the pain and reuniting yourself 
with your pet turtle, you are only 
digging the hole deeper. Come 
Sunday evening when it's time to 
make your return 10 UCSD, you 
will be reminded of how much 
you wish you could JUSt stay home 
where no one will move your 
laundry if YOll forget 10 rake it out 
of the dryer. Too bad, but you 
acrually have to come back here. 
By going home all the time, you 
risk thinking about the great 
weekend y 1I had at home all 
through the week and h w much 
you can't wait until neXl weekend . 
Going home tOO often can deprive 
college student of leading a full 
campus life because they're so 
attached to home, it'~ like they 
never even left . Instead, try to 
make trips home Ie s frequenl ' 0 
your home life won 't lake over 
your VCSD life. 

Lastly, let's face it, no malter how 
busy you are, how dear your friends 
are to you, or when the last time you 
went home was, there are still those 
times when we just feel 0 bogged 
down by everything. Unfornmately, 
without a car you're stuck here 
because its a four-day walk home. 
For the times that the home ick 
symptoms hit hard, try looking at 
pictures, calling home, or just hang 
our with someone else who went to 
your rugh school (only if yO\l can 
stand him), so you can talk aboul 
your hometown. These quick meth-
ods usually provide some hort-term 
relief for homesickne . 

While UCSD can feel over-
whelming and crowded with m re 
people than you'll probably ever 
know, it is YOUl' home away from 
home for the next four years of your 
college career, or however long it is. 
It will be in your best interest to 
make sure you can make it your 
home, and, if not, then remember 
what they tell you at Psychological 
and Counseling Services: You are 
not alone. According to Juarez, free, 
confidential help is alwa available 
there. 

Strive to stay oplimistic and 
you'll be just fine, becallse as sopho-
more Wendy Peterson said, "Thou 
shalt not be homesick, for the homc 
is where your friends arc, wruch is 
here, near your heart - and 
UCSD."

Media: KSDT and SRTV pave the way for on--campus media creativity

walk around campus, people will 
know what KSDT is." 

KSDT is a special breed, and 
holds its own candle on a campus 
known for scientific research. It is 
no surprise that SRTV was a spin-
off of the radio stanon. A few stu-
dent al KSDT had the rumblings 
of an idca about a student-run lele-
vision station that could broadcast 
live KSDT radio programs and 
IIlcrease its profile as well as air the 
music videos of the bands that were 
featured at KSDT 

Eight years and $30,000 later, 
SRTV Gencral Manager Jared 
Lindo sits in an exceedingly warm 
produclion room, faced with 
numerous televi-

" 

pend ent and started produci ng 
more mai nstrcam-esq ue shows," 
Lindo sa id. "Each year we just got 
stronger, and with the funds we 
received, we were able to get ome 
real equipment in here." 

With three professional quality 
studio cameras, one small 
digital/video handheld camera, two 
new editing computers on the way, 
a stage, and some good old fash-
ioned initiative, SR'IV is truly in a 
place its never been before - pro-
ducing a full season of shows with 
equipmclll on hand , and a staff that 
is growing quickly. 

"Luvmatch," a dating show 
with pre-recorded footage shot and 
edileJ tillS ~Ulnmer, is produced by 

sions and audio 
mixers that look 
like som.cthing out 
of Star Trek to the 
novice. He walches 
over the direction 
of SRTV as it 
changes from a sta-
tion that on ly 
broadcasted KSDT 
radio programs, to 
a station that creat-
ed entirely original 
material.

this campus to know 
about SR1V. I want

crs. It is the high-
light of the station' 
production sched-
ule and is a show 
that everyone takes 
pride in 

" ] want every-
one on this campus 
to know about

echoing KSDT's 
goal. " I want peo-
ple to watch our

the thing to dn , JJ 

"]'m glad ] got 
here when I did 
because SRTV is 
growing and, before 
long, VCSD is 
going to be known 
for it," Lindo said. 
"There's no reason 
it houldn 't." 

- Jared lindo, SRTV 
General Manager 

He leaned for-
ward, seemi ngly 
unaware that the 

programs are so 
good, that it becomes the thing to 
do." 

Though SRTV broadcasts on 
Triton Cable channel 18, SRTV 
also takes an alternative route to 
reaching viewers. According to 
Lindo, SRTV is one in under five 
college televi ion stations in the 
country with an internet broadcast. 
And, it works. The call-in shows 
like "Sexy exy how" and "Moan 
and Groan" can have the station 
telephone lines ringing with ques-
tions until 6 a.m. (ineedcntially, this 
happens most often when the topic 
turns lO ex). 

"We grcw out of KSDT but 
then people really sta rted to pay 
attention when we got more inde-

cameras were on 

him (bul not taping) and his image 
was on the four televisions that sur-
rounded him. He tapped his foot 
and considered the five years ahead 
of SRTv. 

"There will be that point 
where we become really well -
known, and the shows just keep 
getting better," Lindo said . "Until 
then, we waIL: a fine line between 
taying true to the media, being 

indepe ndent and censorship-free 
and becoming popular. It's a diffi -
cult line to walk." 

But SRTV walks it, just as 
KSDT does. They may evcn start 
to run. 

" It's the future down here," 
Shah said. "Things are ready to 
explode."

., I THE EDITORS' SOAPBOX 
Get behind the scenes of the recall 
True confessions of a gubernatorial candidate 

By DANIEL WATTS 
Opinion Editor 

Next time I run for governor, 
I'll keep a few things in mind. 

First, it's important not to take 
yourself too seriously when you 
have no chance of winning. 

My goal wasn't to win the elec-
tion, but to convince the major 
candidates in the race to adopt a 
"lower student fees" plank into 
their platforms. I figured the next 
governor would pay attention to a 
21-year-old candidate gening a 
couple thousand votes. 

Peter Camejo, the main Green 
party ca ndidate, had one of his 
staff members call me and ask me 
for advice on the budget and stu-
dent fees , so I made an impression 
on at least one of the "big" candi-
dates. But I never acted like some-
thing I wasn 't . 

Unlike fellow college candidate 
Bryan Quinn, a 20-year-old 
Republican from Los Gatos who 
looks like he's 15 and acts like he's 
SO. I didn't wear business suits every-
where I went (I wore a $1 7" ext 
Governor of California" t-shirt from 
bttp:II7JTWW.lSbirthtll.com). Using 
"Wheel of Fortune" winnings, I paid 
for my own filing fee and covered 
my campaign expenses, which 
amounted to less than $200. I made 
no pretenses: My baUot designation 
read "Daniel Watts - College 
Student," while Quinn claimed to be 
a 2O-year-Qld "businessman." The 
guy probably had a lemonade stand 
when he was eight, and he thinks 
that makes him a businessman. He 
wasn't fooling anyone, evidenced by 
his lOth-place finish, a few places 
ahead of accused murderer ott 
Davi . 

econd, the media will alway 
misquote you and take everything 
out of context, so candidate 
should go wild and say whatever 
they want. 

ational Public Radio blatant-
ly made up quotes. Fox New used 
a doctored photograph of me 
superimposed over Gray Davi ' 
body when John Gib on intro-
duced my interview. And when I 
told the San Diego UlIIon- Trtbullt 
that lowering student fees would 
help the economy by putting 
money back into students' pockets 
- who'd then spend it on 
videogames and comic books -
the article's headline read, 
" tudent will do his part by read-
ing comic boaks." If there were 
any doubts in my mind that the 
U1IIon-Tribunt is an inferior paper 
ridden with bias, they were van-
qUIshed by that headlme. 

Liberal media outlcts tend to 
trea t minor candidate better than 
the con ervative media . Fox ews 
and the SaCTammlo Bu broadcast 
and published a doctored photo-
graph and the UlIIon-TnbU//t ban-
i hed my artiele to the 
" . nrertainment" section, while 
!.he more liberal LOI Angtlu Timt 
and San JOlt Mercury Nt'WI gave 
me solid, unbiased coverage in 
their front ections. The 7,mn 

even sent a reporter and photog-
rapher to San Jose to shadow me 
for a couple days wh ile I cam-
paigned at junior colleges - a 
considerable expense, especially 
for such a minor candidate. 

A benefit of running, however, 
is that candidates get free stuff. 
Gateway gave me a digital cam-
era, the only accompanying con-
dition being to upload a photo to 
their btrp:llwww.candidoteclrl1lfTa.co11l 
Web site each day - among the 
U SO photos I posted were pic-
rures of my inrendo GallleCube 
and Revelle 's ca nnibalistic 
Unolympics skit. Early in the 
campaign, while visiting a friend 

" I asked a Blockbuster 
clerk if gubematarial 
candidates get free 

movies. Apparently they 
do, and I walked out of 
there with my one,day 

"Chicago" rental without 
paying. A later visit to a 
Thai restaurant brought 

me to the troubling 
conclusion that we do not 

also get free Thai iced 
teas. " 

in Davi , I a ked a Blockbuster 
clerk if gubernatorial candidate 
get free movies. Apparently they 
do, and I walked out of there with 
my one-day "Chicago" rental 
without paying. A later ,'isit to a 
Thai restaurant brought me to the 
troubling conclusion that we do 
not also get free Thai iced teas. 

For all the talk of the recall 
"circus," mo t candidates were 
surprisi ngly intelligent and quali-
fied, if not electable. It' sad that 
so many qualified people had 
absolutely no chance of winning. 
The e people were lawyers, doc-
tOrs, scientists, teachers and engi-
neers. Most of them, with the 
exception of entertainment candi-
dates like Gary Coleman and porn 
star Mary "Carey" Cook, 
would've made better governor 
than half of the major candidates. 

After meeting more than 100 
of these candidates, I've learned 
that the media only treats you like 
a circus sideshow if you let them. 
For example, Jay Leno invited me 
and the other candidates down to 
"The Tonight Show." In the mid-
dle of the taping, candidate 
William Tsangares donned a 
Terminator mask and chanted, 
"Equal time! Equal time'" He 
brought "The Tonight Show" to a 
creeching halt - an interruption 

later edited out for the nightly 
broadcast. He didn't participate in 
Leno's li ttle circus, so his protest 
didn't make the waves it should 
have. The new coverage of "The 
Tonight Show" instead focused on 
the porn star's reaction to one of 
Leno's jokes, completely ignoring 
the biggest event of the night . 
(Strangely enough, the media also 
neglectcd to cover the porn star's 
pre- taping strip show pcrfor-
mance .) That same day, 
Tsangares, who has si nce changed 
his name to "Bill Wyan," declared 
hi s intention to seck the 
Republican party's 2004 presiden-
tial nomination. 

I 've also learned that some 
people just don 't pay attention. 
Out of the hundreds of instant 
messages and e-mails from people 
who visited http://wattsforgovtr-
nor.com, I've gotten dozen asking 
me the same questions: Why are 
you running? Do you think you'll 
win? Why should I vote for YOll? 

The answers are in the first 
three paragraphs of the Web si te 
where they found my e-mail 
address and screen name. Even 
though the e people put ludi -
crous�y little effort into resea rch 
before harassing me, the mere fact 
that they looked at their voter's 
guide to find my Web itc means 
they put more effort into voting 
than most Californians. 

Now that the election's over, 
I'll still come across an occa ional 
reference to me on someone's 
Web site. 

UC 0 students ask, " Ilow 
many peopl e actuall voted for 
Daniel Wan ?" 

1,918 at last count. For a 2 1-
yea r-old college student wh se 
political experi encc consists of a 
4-month stint as prc ident of 
Blossom alley Elementary 
School, that' not bad at all. 

Put into perspective, that's 
eight timcs more than those who 
votcd for the "fake" Bob D Ie for 
governor. 

It 's also five timcs morc than 
those who voted for me for Earl 
Warren College pre ident in 

pring 2003, and twice as many as 
those who voted for 2003 I\.S. 
presidential ca nclidat Kevin 
Shawn Il sli. It wa enough to put 
me in 39th place Out of 135 candi-
dates. 

Having ran for governor and 
been on "Wheel of Fortune" la t 
spring during their college sea rch 
in an Diego, simply going back 
to school would be a real do\vner. 
I need to do omething reall), big 
to keep from sinking into unbear-
able depre sion. 

Therefore, I hereby announ e 
my intention to establish a colo ny 
on Mars, rule it as Martian Prune 
Minister, and populate my fief-
dom with intendo character 
brought to life. My followers and 
I will remake the barren Mar

The second day, railed Choti 
Diwal, is about a demon king

earrings belonging to the mother 
goddess Aditi before impri oning 
16,000 daughters of the gods. 
Lord Knshna killed the demon 
and freed the il11pri oned daugh-

tations which lead and welcome

orful and personal displays that 
each individual family create 
make this a truly family-oriented 
time. 

Rituals of Diwali include 
Lakshmi-Puja, a ritual to Lakshmi, 
the Hindu goddess of wealth. This 
ritual is in the evenings when tiny 
diyas, or lanterns, made of clay are 
lit to drive away the shadows of evil 
spirits. In addition, many sing 
"bhajans," which arc songs dedicat-
ed to pral ing the Hindu gods. Also 
popular is "naivedya," the symbolic 
act of offering traditional swcets to 
the god . " weets are big," said 
Divya Reddy, a Revelle College 
enior. " ulab Jammu are my 

favorite ." 
The Diwali holiday is enthusi-
astic~lIy celebrated for five contin-
uou days and each day i ignifi -
cant with a number of beautiful 
myths, legends and ritua ls. These 
stones are parti ularly significant 
for children in helping them to 
understand their religion. 

"I wish more people knew about 
them. T hey are u h fascinati ng

Patel, a Warren enior. 

The first of the five days of 
Diw,tli celebrations i ailed 
Dh meras, which comes from thc 
word "dhan ," or wealth. Thi day

prepared, and the day is centered 
on the home. It is believed to be 
the rno t promising day to start a 
new venture. 

The fifth and final day of 
Diwali is Bhayya-Duj. As the leg-
end goe, Yamraj, the god of 
death, visited his sister Yami on 
this day. T hey talked, ate sweets 
and enjoyed themselves as they 
never had before. As he was leav-
ing, Yamraj gave hi sister a spe-
cial gift a a token of his love, and, 
in return, Yami also gave him 
something she had made herself. 

ince then, this day is ob erved as 
a symbol of love between sisters 
and brother . 

Diwali ha always been a more 
social and per onal, rather than 
religious, celebration . Families 
enjoy their closeness and forget 
about pervading problems and 
stresses of modern day life. 

"Even though I'm busy with 
schoolwork, I always make a point 
of celebrating Diwali," Patel said. 
" It's a time whcn everyone forget 
what's going on in their own busy 
schedules and appreciates each 
other's company. We celebratc 
and have parties and keep up all 
the traditional ritual . Therefore 
it's omething unique and special 
that everyone look forward to 
every ycar."

San Bernardino fires cancel matches 
Men's and women's soccer games postponed 

By CYNTHIA CHAVEZ 
Sports Editor 

The U SO men and womens 
soccer tcams' ct. 25 matches at Cal 
State San Bernardino were canceled 
due to a wildfire that spread to the 
campus. The men' soccer team, 
whose match was scheduled at 12:30 
p.m., was within eight miles of the 
campus before havi ng to turn 
around and drive back to UCSD. 

Meanwhile, just as UCSD 
women's soccer head coach Brian 
McManus and his team were getting 
ready to leave for San Bernardino, 
Tri ton men 's soccer head coach 
Derek Armstrong phoned 
McManus and infonned him that 
the soccer matches were cancelled. 

Cal State San Bernardino Public 
Affairs Director Sid Robinson said 
that smoke 6lled up the entire cam-
pus and the surrowl(ling areas, forc-
ing the evacuation of the school. 

"It is yet to be determined when 
all regular campus activities will 
resume," Robinson said. 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team was disappointed by the can-
cellation and is concerned about 
the long break between matches. 

"We have not played in two 
weeks," McManus said. "We had to 

head back to U SO and practice. 
IThe womenJ were ready to play 
and they were used lO playi ng every 
Friday and aturday. Wednesday'S 
I CI. 29J match will be hard. h I; 
hard to get back and compete [after 
a long break] ." 

The women's socce r team cur-
rently holds a 12- 1 overall record, 
wi th a conference record of 10- 1, 
clinching their fourth consecutive 
South division title. 

Armstrong and the men's soc-
cer team were also let down by the 
cancellation. 

"Everybody was disappointed, 
especially when you're built up to 
play," Armstrong aid. "But, it was 
an act of God, you can't do any-
thing about it ... rescheduling the 
game will be a major problem 
because of classes and midterms." 

In lieu of the match, the men's 
soccer team held an intrasquad 
match on RIMAC field wh~n they 
returned to UCSD. The men's team 
currently holds first place in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association South division. The 
Tritons need only one point in their 
final two matches to clinch their sec-
ond straight division title. 

Injuries plague the men's soccer 
team, but the intrasquad match 

gave the Tritons a chance to sharp-
en their skills. 

"We have a rash of injuries with 
our defense," Armstrong said. "It's 
inconvenient for us, bur every team 
has to deal with it. This provides the 
opportunity for people to step up 
and we have stepped up the training, 
[we've] increased the inten ity." 

Senior defender and co-captain 
Ryan Blair is out for the rest of the 
season after tearing a ligament from 
an old injury, according to 
Armstrong. Also, junior defender 
Luke Russell would have missed 
today's match with a thigh injury, as 
would sophomore defender Grant 
Nishio, who has a slight muscle pull. 
Armstrong is being very careful with 
his injured players, giving them time 
to heal in time for postseason play. 

"I'm resting Grant [Nishio) for a 
few days and Luke [Russell) is going 
to the medical room," Armstrong 
said. "We're trying to be u1tra-cau-
tious." 

The rescheduling of the Oct. 25 
matches is not yet decided, but the 
men's soccer team will play its last 
regular season match on Nov. I at 
home against Grand Canyon at 7 
p.m . The women's soccer team will 
play a home match on Oct. 29 at 
Triton Soccer Stadium at 4:3 0p.m.

Men's tennis sends a trio to finals 
Chopra, Wilson take second in doubles 

By CYNTHIA CHAVEZ 
Sports Editor 

In the world of sports, there's 
usuallv a team or two that unex-
pectedly craps I£S way into the 
postseason, such as the Florida 
1arhn and the Anaheim Angels. 

Despite being the underdogs, the 
Fi h and the Halos have found 
success. 

The same could be said for 
three players on the UCSD men\; 
tenni team. Junior Bryan wan 
and senior doubles parmers 

ameer hopra and Jeff Wilson 
played solidly at the Intercollegiate 
Tennis Association Small College 
Championships in Corpus Christi, 
Tex. lr was a tournament no one 
really expected them to partal<e in_ 

Swan placed second in the sin-
gle' Con olation Draw, while 
Chopra and Wilson (the lone 
Americans in the draw) placed sec-
ond overall in the Division II dou-
bles final. On the whole, UC D 
head coach Eric teidlmayer was 
pleased with his players. 

"Their performances were 
solid. Bryan [ wan) overcame a 
nervous first set at the tournament 
and played well after that," 
Steidlmayer said . "Jeff Wilson 
played some amazing doubles in 
the semifinal match that they won, 
and in the final of the doubles we 
played a solid match, pretty good 
considering the nerves involved." 

watt, Chopra and Wilson 
won the [TA West Regionals sin-
gles and doubles titles, respective-
ly, and advanced them to the finals 
on t. 16-18 to face ingles and 
doubles title-holders from other 
regions. The Triton played in the 
finals for the first time and con-
tended against mostly older, for-
eign athletes with scholarship . 
The absence of the elite tenms 
school of BYU-Hawaii and 
Ilawai i Pacific allowed CSD 
past the regionals. 

"[The abscnce of BYU-Hawaii 
and Ilawaii Pacific) was good 
because it gave us a chance to 
provc to thc rest of the coun try 
that we are just as good as the 
Hawaii schools," Wilson said . 
"Many of thc other schools don't 
think we can play becausc we 
don't get past regionals." 

erves were a factor at the 
beginning of the tournament. 
Swan said, "we were definitely ner-
vous, being that none of us had 
ever made it this far and we were 
up against the best in the country." 

Swan, who had previously 
edged out 40 other players in the 
West Regionals, lost to Dante 
Cipulli of Southwest Baptist in his 
quarterfinal match-up, 6-1 and 6-3. 

"I played O .K. and competed 
hard, but [Cipullil was just a better 
player and he just plays at a high-
er level than I do," Swatt said . 

This loss dropped Swatt to the

stunning upset of defending champions MaltJas Odone and Akos Ta a of Drury 

consolation draw where he got 
pa t Peter Veselovsky of Downing 
College, 6-3 and 6-3. Swart 
adva nced to the final against 
Gerret Lotz of Northwo d 
University. Lotz captured the title 
with his 6-2, 7-5 win over watt. 

Overall, watt felt he played 
well and learned there are parts of 
his game needing improvement. 

"Everyone I played was very 
good and there were no easy 
matches," watt said. "1 realized 
that I have to get tronger, devel -

more patience on the court. If I 
can do this, it will make a huge 
difference in my game." 

On the doubles end, nerves got 
the better of Chopra and Wilson 
in the beginning, but after a pep 
talk from Steidl mayer, the pair 
was able to edge Pauliu Jurkenas 
and Mario Vergara from the 
University of West Florida, 7-5, 
4-6 and 10-7, on Oct. 16. This 
victory earned them a match 
against the o. I seed and last 
year' double title-holders, 
Andres Bori and Mark Eori of 
Southwest Baptist on Court 1. 
Feeling they had to prove them-
selves with all the schools watch-

huge upset. 

"In the econd match, we came 
out firing against the defending 
champions who were cocky," 
Wilson said . "But we hocked 
them and they just had no 
answers. I had lots of energy and 
confidence in my shots; I couldn't 
miss. I felt like I could just swing 
and the ball would go in, it was a 
good feeling." 

hopra and Wil on finished 
off Bori and Eori in straight sets 
6-4, 7-6(7). Wil on also had high 
praise for his partner, Chopra, 
who "knocked guys over with a

Polo: Tritons lose control of 
speed and rhythm of play 
continued from page 24 

scori ng wi th just 29 seconds 
remaining in the hal f. 

In addition to his five goa ls, it 
was clear that Azevedo led his team 
by orchestrating the offense and 
helping Stanford maintain conttol. 

"Even if he doesn't seore every 
goal, he runs their team," Cooper 
aid. "If we take Tony [Azevedol out 

of the game, we can beat Stanford." 
Clearly, Azevedo's five points 

were not the distinguishing factor 
in the decision, but his ability to 
establish control within the game 
allows him to be a sho,-caller. 

"I think that we could have con-
tained him uelter," Peterson said . 
"He was just scoring the counterat-
tack; othcrwise, he only earned one 
goal off our set defense. " 

Thc Tritons lost each of the first 
two quarters by two goals, but were 
able play better for the closing peri-
ods. In the third quarter, the Tritons 
managed to hold Stanford to twO 
goals to their own one. 

The speed of the game slowed in 
the waning quarters as each team felt 
the effect of its intense counterat-
tacking. Both sides were able to set 
up their offense and defense for suit-
able lengths of time to run more 
plays than in earlier periods. 

"We were able to run the set 
offense later," Cooper said. "We 
had a couple of half -court goals and 

a couple of man-up goals." 
Those late-game conversions 

would not be enough to bring 
UCSD back in the game before the 
clock expired, Stanford up 13-7. 

The Tritons agreed that the 
pace of the game was out of hand . 
This squad relie on comr lIing 
the speed and rhythm of play. 
When that advantage wa lost, the 
ability to regulate the match is lost. 

Azevedo's five goals wcre a 
Stanford team high of 50, while 
UCSD leading scorer Jonathan 
[Iopkins and his brotllcr, Stanford\; 
second-highest scorer, Thomas 
Hopkins, were hoth scoreless. 

"We made a lot of tupid plays 
but hopefully we can make up for 
that and play them again at the 
NCAA tournament," Cooper said.

Volleyball: Injured Wilson returns to the Triton lineup 
com inued from page 24 

ference title as the l"itons trail the 
nation's top team - Cal State San 
Bernardino - by tw games in the 
loss colullln leading into their 
much -anticipated Oct. 31 clash at 
RIMA /\rena. 

The cpt. 19 mat hup betwcen 
CSD and the Colden Eagles of 

Cal tate L.A. proved surprisingly 
easy for the ' I"irons as tlley needed 
just 85 minutes to take care of 
business. The rematch at Cal tate 
L.A.'s Eaglc~ Nest proved to be 
anything but a repeal. 

Gamc one was close throughout, 
hut the .olden Eagles reeled off 
runs at key times to keep the Tritons 
at bay. UCSD ca lled a timeout, 
duwn 25-20 late in game one. Mer 
the Tritons closed the gap to three 
points, Cal tate L.A. pulled away 
and grabbed Ihe 30-23 victory. 

Undaunted, UCSD responded 
well in game two and another tight 
game ensued. There were 12 ties 

throughout the game and the teams 
traded points all tile way to tile end. 
With the Tritons holding a one-
point lead at 29-28, thc Golden 
Eagles' Dione McCrea put down a 
kill to Icvel tile match at 29 apiece. 
U SD then surrendered an :ICC to 

al State LA, which did not waste 
its opportunity. The Golden Fagles 
closed the game with a block for the 
31-29 win and a 2-0 lead. 

Game three offered none of the 
drama of the previous two game 
as UC D was hammered into sub-
mission by a Cal State L.A. team 
thal was determllled to finish the 
match as quickly as possible. The 
Golden Eagles hit an otherworldly 
.636 for the game with 15 kills and 
one error on 22 attempts. The 
Tritons, on the other hand, hit 
-.OJ I as a learn with nine kills and 
10 errors on 32 lOtal attacks. Cal 
State L.A. won easil y, 30-14, to 
complete thc weep. 

The UCSD players were 

understandably upset by the way 
they finished the match. 

"We played like we've never 
played before," said junior setter 
"fcresa hta. "We haven't played 
that bad ly since I've been here." 

Ohta led the Tritons with 41 
a iSlS, outside hiller Stacy 
Dunsmore picked up a team-high 
12 digs and outside hitter Lindsay 

randell adJed 13 kills for UCSD. 
Through the Tritons' long 

tretches on the road, seve ral play-
ers have exprc sed frustration at 
the stresses building due to mi sed 
c1as lime, bu t Ohta insists that 
was not 3n important factor in 
UCSD's recent struggles. 

" lot of people have had to 
take quizzes or tests on the road or 
are ju t studying all tile time," she 
sa id. "But it's always been my atti-
tude that you don't think aboul all 
that tuff once you go in the gym."

24 to face Cal late Dominguez 
llills. Against the Toros, the 
Tritons found a w:ly to expres~ 
their frustrations in " posittve 
manner. 

Mer trailing early in the game, 
UC D put togelher a 9-4 run to 
establish a cu hion that they held 
for the rcmainder of the game, 
grabbing the 30-26 Win. Game twO 
was a laugher as the Tritons routed 
Cal State Dominguez Hills, 30-12. 
The third game held more of the 
saille as UC D rolled, 30- 16. 

The return of one of the 
Tritons' strongest players scrved to 
inspire UCSD and to help finish 
the road trip well. 

"Ln the second game, Bonnie 
[Wilsonl got a chance to play and 
she had so much energy balled up 
from the past couple weeks," Ohta 
said. "Tha t energy was conta-
gious." 

Seeing her first significant 
action since she was sidelined by a 
stre s fracture in her foot, Wilson 
contributed five kill on 11 
attempts during the final two 
games. Middle blocker Kendra 
Canape led the team with II kills 
on the eveni ng while hitting .667. 

anape also hared the team-high 
in blocks with oppo ite hley 
Peterson as each player accumulat-
ed six. Another solid double-digit 
kill night for Dunsmore with 11 ,35 
assists for Ohta, and a team-leading 
eight digs by opposite Lauren Mills 
pushed the Tritons to victory. 

Having put a stretch of difficult 
matches behind them, UC D will 
return home on Oct. 30 without 
reprieve. The Tritons will face an 
always-tough Cal Poly Pomona 
squad in a rare Thursday night 
match before the long-awaited 
battle with Cal State Sa n 
Bernardino on Oct. 3 I. Both 
matches begin at 7 p.m at RL'vIAC.

"[Odone and Tatjal were hitting 
clutch shots in the tie-breaker and 
the whole match," \, t1son aid. 
"They hit perfect lobs III the tie-
breakcr to get an early 3-0 lead." 

Although Wilson and Chopra 
lost thei r finals match, they turned 
heads at the tournament, prompting 
a coach to comment that UCSD was 
"a lot better than he thought," and 
that his team would need "body 
armor" to play against UCSD. 

Wilson and Chopr:l were not 
partners last ycar, but tlley did play 
together once and beat a Division I 
doubles team. They had ~ince been 
wondering if the chemistry dley felt 
would translate well if they paired 
up. The performance at regionals 
and fina ls ans" :ered that question. 

" am~er dnd I have very IInilar 
game ," \Vilson said . ""Vc are both 
tall with quick hands and we both 
like to blanket the net. Now, we 
can be the team to beat where 
other schools are gunning for us." 

In addition, the Tritons enjoyed 
their tay, due in p:lrt to the ho t 
family, the Van Heusens. 

"Oamesl is 3 phYSical trainer so 
he helped us stretch out and [Karcnl 
was the best cook ever, cooking us 
gourtnet meals. [ think I gamed five 
pound on the trip," Wilson said.

Oct. H with C 0 losing to

by junior All-American, two-time

The counterattack mentality

" \Ve sel f-destructed on our 

counteratta k defense," junior 
lark Peterson -aid. "Our set 

defense was pretty good. We con-
tained them on the half court and 
had good two-meter defense, but 
it wa mostly rurnaround goals 
that killed us ... we wouldn't con-
vert on our set offense, then they 
would come back for a one-on-
nobody or two-on-one goal." 

The inability for either team to 
slow the pace of the game reduced 
the match to looking like a swim 
meet with a ball. In addition, for 
Triton players that typically pride 
themselves on their speed and 
counterattacking prowe , it wa 
difficult to constantly sprint the 
length of a 30-meter tank without 
becoming fatigued and committing 
fundamental error . Stanford was 
able to capitalize on too many of 
the-e lipups, accounting for the 
goal differential. 

"That's a tough way ro start, 
especially again t a team ranked 
above you," junior ate Cooper 
said, referring to the early three-
goal deficit. "Our non-counterat-
tack defense was trong and we 
only allowed one or twO goals out 
of the et offense." 

The econd period proved 
omewhat easier to bear, tllOugh 

the Cardinal continued to widen 
their lead as they pushed the core 
up to 8-4. Azevedo knocked in two 
more goals for Stanford as the 
Trirons were hutout through the 
first 6:30 of the period. finally
