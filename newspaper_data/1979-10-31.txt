Fuel ~L'eak in New Tank 
Goes Unrepaired During 
October: 'Fire Hazard' 

MDraho 
Jim Froman holds a bag he used to plumb an oil leak that has lost 
over 2,000 gallons of fu.el during October. 

By Risa Lee Podolsky 
Staff Writer 

A new tank has been leaking fuel oil into the 
ground and sewer system for 26 days. 

The tank, which began pumping Aug. 7, 
filled with 100,000 gallons of fuel, began 
leaking Oct. 5 at the rate of J SO gallons a day. 

It will continue to leak unlll at least Saturday, 
campus engineers say . 

John Hughes, a Lhief engineer for the 
campus Architects and Engineers Department, 
says his office is planning to clean out the tank 
Saturday by sandblasting. 

Hughes says the move has been in the 
planning stage for some time, though he admits 
his office has "made no plans beyond cleaning" 
for correcting the deficiency. 

In the meantime, oil fumes are rising out of 
12 holes dug around the tank while it leaks, 
according to Physics instructor and machine 
shop head Jim Froman. 

The fumes are "very flammable," Froman 
says, and could easily ignite. 

The San Diego City Fire Department told the 
Cuardian that it won't intervene because it 
doesn't have jurisdiction. "The municipal fire

the party's nominee in the next 
election. 

Nationally, among Demo-

crats, Carter is now 
running behind Senator Edward 
Kennedy by margins of close 
to two-to· one - and by even 
greater margins in California 
and other industrialstatea. This 

is a situation 
an incumbent President. 

ever witnessed. 
Carter has vowed to light to 

the finish, brushing aside any 
suggestion that he follow the 
example of Presidents Truman 
and Johnson. Each decided 
not to run for another term ; 

, each was in much better shape 
with the American public than 
Carter is now. 

While there will be. a number 
of caucuses the other skirmishes 
prior to Feb. 26, the New 
Hampshire poUs show Kennedy 
far ahead of President Carter 
and Gov. Brown. In many 
polls in that state, Kennedy 
receives more than the combined 
vote for Carter and Brown. 

Kenn~y could win New Hamp-
shire by a large majority -
something which few previous 
Presidential candidates have 
done in contested races.

troubled timea or the man, the

Al8uming Kennedy wins the

Capitalization Defeats Racism 
Editor: 

In response to James May-

26) to Nadine Adams' letter 
(Oct. 22), I could well begin 
by aaking, "Where ia this nation 
of White?" etc. Thi. I ahall not

I mUit agree both with the 
speciOUI Mayer and the vitrio· 
lic Adams. Both black and 
white should be capitalized 
when referring to people, 
racial identity. The reason has 
nothing to do with inter-
national relations, however. It 
is a siE'ple matter of j(rammar. 

When an adjective of racial, 
national or ethnic identifica· 
tion preceeds a noun it has the 
effett of creating a proper noun. 

I suppose that, more properly, 
it is a proper adjective, for the 
noun itself does not require 
captialization. As we all should 
recaU from elementary school 
grammar class, proper nouns, 
or in thi. case adjectives, must 
be capitalized. 

Example. abound. To wit, 
Chicano, Caucasian and Native 
American to name but a few.

Watch Out For This Man 
Editor: 

Hitchhiking to UCSD lut week I was picked up by a man in a 
brown, late model BMW who identified himself first as Bil and 
then as an exhibitioniat and asked me if I would mind if he 
expoeed himself to me while driving up here. 

When I balked at the idea he told me he quite frequently picka 
up young women hitchhiken and offer. thern money to look at 
him. It'. his trip; he doesn'l seem violent and told me-he isn't into 
rape (moat exhibitioniata do not engage in sexual intercourse; 
their wliole sexual trip ia exposure and masturbation), but he had 
on hia front seat what must have been an aeros-' can of Mac~.

It a110 has the effect of mak-
ing no differentiation between 
the label for the people and the 
concepts associated in West-

it is 81 though no differentia-

The terms black and white

to any .upposed characteris· 
tics of the people described 
other than a crude approxima-
tion of their colors. As such 
they are used as proper terms 
of identification and should be 
capitalized regardless of the 
color used.

Blacks vs. Jews? A Look 
Editor: 

Hidden divisions within traditionally strong black.Jewis~ rela. 
tionships have surfaced recently. Throughout the early so. the 
civil rights movement showed a firm working relationship 
between the black and Jewish communities. This part· 
nership began fading in the late 60s and early 70s and has 
reached a point approaching schism. 

' Why is this so? Is Andrew Young'. resignation the major 
factor? What about some other 
illuea? Take, for eXlUnple, Israeli·South African relations, 
black identification with Arab Muslims, or on the domestic front, 
colege entrance quotas and mandatory busing. These issuea 
have raised tensions between Jewiah and black communities, 
tensions that derive from a basic lack of communication. 

It is imperAtive to overcome this communication gap. We 
mUit eliminate misunderstandings by discounting propaganda 
and reaching the facts. In order to obtain a clear view of the 
illues many sides must be addressed.

US Beefs SE Asia 

SINGAPORE - US Assistant Secretary of State 
Richard Holbrooke said that more US military 
' hardwar~ is being rushed to Thailand. Malaysia and 
the Philippines to strengthen the armies of those 
countries . 

And elements of the 7th fleet are en route to the 
southern harbor of Pu~ari in a show-of-force warning 
to North Korea following South Korean President 
Park's assassination Friday. 

In Prague, meanwhile, Vietnam 's defense chief 
was quoted in a Czechoslovak newspaper as saying 
the United States and China are arming unidentifed 
forces for an attack on Cambodia. 

Holbrooke told a news conference here that the 
United States was again getting involved in 
Southeast Asia by supporting the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations - Singapore. Malaysia. 
Indonesia , Thailand and the Philippines - known as 
ASEAN. 

Asked whether Vietnam would invade Thailand, 
he said "the Vietnamese have stated that they would 
not. We attach great importance to that statement. 

"Thailand is the key to ASEAN and ASEAN is 
the key to Southeast Asia," he said. Only the 
president could decide whether the United States can 
be militaray involved if Thailand were invaded, he 
argued. 

A-Bombs by India? 
NEW DEHLI, India - India will reconsider its 

policy of not manufacturing atomic weapons if 
neighboring Pakistan goes nuclear, the acting 
defense minister says. 

"I shall not be naive enough to declare on behalf of 
all future generations and governments that India will 
not make nuclear weapons." Chidambara 
Subranamium said yesterday. 

"If Pakistan were to develop a nuclear arsenal, 
then a second situation of asymmetry ' (0 1ndia's ' 
disadvantage will develop," the minister added. 
India's other neighbor, China, has nuclear weapons. 

Last weekend, Pakistan President Zia UI· Haq said 
he did not rule out the possibility that Pakistan might 
explode a nuclear device. 

Nukes Must Change 
WASHINGTON - The presi~ential commission 

on Three Mile Island called yesterday for 
"fundamental changes" in the way nuclear plants are 
built, operated and regulated , but said adoption of its 
recommendations.still would not "assure the safety of 
nuclear power." 

The commission told President Carter that a broad 
range of deficiencies - from licensing and regulating 
atomic plants to the training of operators - made an 
atomic accident such as the one at Three Mile Island 
"eventually inevitable." 

The panel called last March's accident the worst to 
occur at a US commercial nuclear reactor, but said 
health effects probably , were limited to "severe 
mental stress" to area residents. 

Radiation released was so minor that it may never 
be possible to detect whether the March 28 accident 
near Harrisburg, Pa ., will cause additional cases of 
cancer among those who live near the facility. 

The 12-member panel's findings are advisory and 
many of its recommendations, including a proposal 
that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission be 
abolished, would take congressional approval. 

. Harsher MPG Rules? 
WASHINGTON - ' The Carter administration 

told Congress Tuesday it is considering setting 
tougher auto fuel-economy standards as part of a 
campaign to make conservation its No.1 energy 
priority. 

Deputy Energy Secretary John Sawhill said 
strengthening the stand~d beyond the 27.5 mile-per. 
gallon performance specified for 1985 models under 
existing law is being studied. 

"Because of the critical role that the automobile 
plays in our energy picture. it is important that we 
continue to explore ways to improve mileage 
efficiency," Sawhill told a House subcommittee. 

He also said an effort will be made to apply the 
same type of fuel economy standards to light trucks , 
beginning in 1982, that now apply to autos. He said 
the energy officials would get together with 
Transportation Department and Environmenlfll 
Protection Agency officials to revie.w the situatio~. 

Prop 1 Clarification 
SACRAMENTO - Under pressure from busing 

opponents, two top state officials issued unUIiUal 
public statements yesterday characterizing 
Proposition 1 on next Tuesday's ballot as an anti-
busing mea"Sure. _ 

The statements by Secretary of State March Fong 
Eu and Attorney General George Deukmejian had 
been sought by Sen. Alan Robbins, D-Van Nuys, 
who has expressed fear voters won't understand his 
proposed constitutional amendment is an anti.busing 
measure. 

Though the immediate reason for Robbins' requea;t 
was his complaint that Deukmajian's short baUot 
summary of the measure was misleading. on a 
broader level it involves probably the biggest 
question of the Proposition 1 campaign - how 
voters understand the measure. 

Robbins contends Proposition 1 would stop what 
he calls forced busing in Los Angeles and elsewhere 
in the state. 

His problem is that bUliing opponents, reading in 
their ballot that the f1)Casure involved pupil 
transportation and the courts, might vote against it, 
thinking they were voting against busing. 

Tijuana Hijack 
SAN D1EGO-A man claiming to have a bomb 

hijacked a Pacific Southwest Airlines jettiner with 
101 persons aboard late last night and was arrested 
by Mexican police when the plane landed i~ Tijuana. 

F1ight 784 arrived safely at San Diego's Lindbergh 
Field only a half-hour late, psA spokesmen a;aid. No 
injuries were reported. 

The plane took off from Sacramento at 8:32 pm 
and had a 30·minute layover at Los Angeles 
International Airport about an hour later, authorities 
said. 

The airline received word that it had been hijacked 
at 10:25 pm··-only ,seven minutes before the plane 
was due to land at Lindbergh Field. PSA 
spokdesman Duane Youngbar said. 

"Everyone on the plane was just fine." Youngbar 
said. "The man said he had a bomb and just wanted 
to be taken out of the country."

such grant given any California arts group this year. 

The other donations include $1 million from the city of San 
Diego, $750,000 from the state of California, $250,000 from 
San Diego County and $2 million in pledges from corporations, 
foundations and individuals. .

Home Beach, Nice Waves Help 
By David Goetz 

Excellent waves and the 
home beach advantage helped 
the UCSD surf team triumph 
over their opponents in two tri-
meets last weekend. 

In Saturday's highly 
competitive match. the Tritons 
pulled off their second win of 
the aea50n again.t SDSU. 
UCSD scored 68.5, SDSU 
58,/ and Pt. Lorna 30.5. The 
T ntOn and Aztec men rolled 

up virtually identical scores 
but UCSD pulled away in the 
kneeboarding and women's 
divisions. 

Point Lorna College 
exhibited some fine individual 
surfing. although as a team 
they did not pose a serious 
threat to either of the others.

ball team joined a little "hus· 
tle" with rooksteady defensive 
play to earn them a pair of 
easy victories last weekend. 

The Tritons rolled over a 
scrappy La Verne College 
team in five games last Friday 
in the gym. Triton coach Doug 
Dannevik called his team's per-
formance "steady and smooth," 
as they "out·hustled" La Verne. 
The Tritons' enthusiastic play 
forced numerous errors on the 
La Verne team. which had to 
struggle to ke-ep pace in the 
games . 

Saturday the Tritons trav· 
elled up to Thousand Oaks to 
devastate the meager Cal Luth· 
eran team in three straight 
games. 15·10. 15·10. 15·5. 
for their ninth win of the sea· 
son. Coach Dannevik thought 
his Tritons were "playing much 
better as a team" in Saturday's 
match. but . he commended 
Cheryl Wright. Beth Prather, 
and Lara Churchill particularly 
for their fine defensive play. 
Offensively. the Tritons were 
led by Elaine Bergman. whose 
skiUful hitting earned the team 
many points in the lo~ided 
victory. 

Coach Dannevik believes that 
these recent back·to·back vic· 
tories may have given the Tri· 
tons the momentum they need 
to make the Regional.. held 
Nov. 23 and 24. Currently, in 
spite of a 6-1 league record. 
the Tritons are in second place 

. in their league, behind unde· 

feated Azusa Pacific· the only 
team that has beaten them. 

To go to the Regionals the 
Triton. must finish first in their 
league. so it is very important 
that they win each of their 
remaining six games.especially 
their rematch next Thursday 
with Azusa Pacific. If the Trit· 
ons continue to turn in perfor· 
mances like they did in last 
weeks victories. they shouldn't 
have too much trouble. 

Friday's match features the 
Tritons at home in the Main 
Gym again.t croll·town rival 
Pt. Lorna CoUege. The team 
faced Pt. Lorna earlier in the 
.ealon on the Pt. Lorna courta 
and took three straight gamel 
from them. Pt. Lorna haa impro. 
ved considerably since that 
first meeting. and the Tritons 
will be grateful for their home· 
court advantage when they 
face Pt. Lorna again this Fri· 
day. Gametime is 7 pm.

Confusing, But Cameralvork Beautiful 
_Bertoluci's 'Luna' S.ort 'of Looks ~t Incest 

8y Lynette Tom 
Senior Staff Writer 

Director Bernardo Bertolucci possesses a deep 
sense of reverence for 'hI! past. ' These feelin'ls are 
manifested in his five ·hour cinematic epic. 1900, 

. which has his childhood memories of Emiiia, Italy, as 
its foundation. He attempts to recapture the same 
atmosphere in his latest quasi.autobiographical effort, 
Luna. However, the 20th Century Fox production is 
ultimately an unfortunate case of being so close and ' 
yet 50 far . 

The story, scripted by Bertolucci, his brother Giu· 
seppe, and Clare Peploe, is clearly about incest 
between celebrated New York opera singer Caterina 
Silveri and her IS-year-old IOn.turned·heroin·addict, 
Joe' Winter. However, the trio presents the relation· 
ship in a roundabout manner, and drags their feet in 

confi~ing it. ;'fl.e 1'esWt is a wancierinJ series of. 
hokey flashbacks , cryptic references, and multiple 
tangents which finaDy fall into place, more or less, at

the end. Even then, there is an uncertainty as to what 
has actually happened during the past two or so 
hours. Minor characters have an annoying tendency 
to be introduced into the screenplay IOlely for the 
sake of introduction, and fade out of the picture 
almost as mysteriously as they had faded in. Overall . 
viewing Luna is a puzzling , frustrating experience. 

merit for their roles. Tomas Milian's performance is 
adequate as Joe's real father, Giuseppe, a man of 
mystery who has a direct tie·in with the inceltUOUI 
involvement. 

The acting, by comparison, is professional and 
superb. Jill Clayburgh's leading role as Caterina is by 
far the most daring and difficult in her film career. She 
pulls off the performance with customary expertise. 
Equally as challenging is the part of Joe, played by 
Matthew Barry. His portrait of the troubled adoles· 
cent is unusually powerful for someone acting in his , 
first motion picture. The characters'of Ca~rina's best 
friends , Marina and Edward, played by Veronica 
Lazar and P-eter Eyre, would have been more intrigu, 
ing had they been more fully developed. Instead they 
seem expendable, and Lazar and Eyre do nothing of 

The cinematoJ(r~p~y in Luna is fantastic . Vittorio 
Storaro's expansive tracking shob, exquisite mise· 
en·scene. and elaborate camera angles are the best 
vie wers will Jiee this year, possibly exceptinA Stoira· 
ro's previous work on Apocalypse Now. The only 
flaw is that it serves no other purpose. The imagery 
neither degrade. nor enhancel the story. 

The operatic sequences are dubbed but sound ~ve, 
although the rest of the musical score i. as discordant 
as the plot. The English subtitles to Ihe Italian portion 
of the di" logue are sorely inconsistent and the editing 
is executed in a slip.shod fashion

Davis Research Could 
Lead to New Preservation 
Techniques for Food 

DAVIS (AP) - The polar fish, 
which dwells in freezing cold waters, 
may help unlock the door to new 
methods of preserving food and tissue. 
A team of UC scientists, led by DaVIS 
profesliOr Robert Feeney, is preparing 
to return to the Arctic Circle and 
resume a project that began some 15 
years ago. 

What the 66·year-old Feeney and 
his associates hope to learn is the secret 
of an ingredient in the blood of polar 
fish that prevents them from freezing in 
the world's coldest waters - a secret 
that has eluded them in 11 previous 
expeditions. 

'They hope the find, when it is made, 
will help in developing superior 
techniques of freezing vegetables and 
fruits for consumption and body tissues 
for surgery without damage. 

ocean temperature is," says Feeney. 
"Fish can take their temperatu.re below 

what the 'ocean temperature ever 
goes." 

. Jne researchers have made seven 
trips to the Antarctic and four to the 
Arctic Circle in the past. trying to 
unlock the secret of the "anti-freeze" 
ingredient. 

Feeney went to Norway to prepare 
for work next summer on the project 
funded by the National Science 
Foundation, the National Institutes of 
Health and the Norwe g ian 
government. They plan to work off-
and·on for the next 21/2 years aboard 
ships at sea and in laboratories , Feeney 
says. 

Pete W ..... .... Neil Morpn arped Iow-c:oat development at. UCSD yesterday. 
"Fish manufacture within the body a 

compound of proteins which lower the 
freezing temperature below what the 

Feeney, a professor of food science 
and technology, says by understanding 
how to . preserve things from freeze 
damage, he and his team of 
researchers also will learn about the 
freezing process .

Froman is positive that the oil is 
leaking into the sewer. "The ground iii

inches of fuel oil. Where else is it going 
to go?" From one of the holes comes 
the sound of rushing water, which 

If the oil is going into the sewer 
system, it will first go to a treatment 
plant before being dumped into the 
ocean at Point Lorna. 

San Diego city engineer Mel Aubrey 
says, "First, it's illegal. It's highly 
flammable because it floats on top of 
the rest of the water. 

"We have a compound here that 
retards the freezing process," says 
Feeney. "By learning how this works, 
we hope to ha ve some information of 
not only basic importal)ce, but 
practical importance as well." 

This m~ns learning how sharp, 
tissue-damaging ice crystals can be 
prevented from forming when water 
freezes, and thus protect cells, tissues 
and whole organisms preserved in the 
frozen state. 

While Feeney says it probably will 
take years before the key to "anti-
freeze" in fish blOod is found, he and his 
associates "take tiny steps forward 
each year." 

Most of the fish studied ha ve been a 
type of cod, Feeney :.ays.

Poll Woes 
C()I1IiIl Il ~d from "(III" 2 
New York, Carter's position 
will be most tenuous, even if he 
has won In Florida. Under 
those conditions it is not too 
farfetched to have President 
Carter taking the dramatic step 
of withdrawing from active cam-
paigning in any of the subse· 
quent primaries, or of with· 
drawing entirely from thenomin· 
ation race. 

However, Kennedy has three 
big negatives in his bid for the 
Presidency. First is the moral 
weakness issue exemplified by 
his behavior at Chappaquid-
dick and the strained relations 
with his wife. Second is the fact 
that he is seen as a political 
liberal. Third is the fear and 
obsession with the notion that 
Edward Kennedy may a110 
die, as his two brothers did, by 
assassins' bullets. 

Regarding Chappaquiddick, 
I think all voters who were old 
enough to see and hear the 
news at the time have a very 
definite idea of what happened 
and already have made a;ud&e-
ment of Kennedy for his role in 
it. 

The public i, quite aware 
. that . Kennedy i. a political lib-
eral. However, I would aus· 
pect that from here on out 
Kennedy may IOften his tiberal 
stance on some issues, thouth 
I would not expect him to 
compromise much on hi, one 
big iuue: national health insu· 
rance. 

Where does California's 
Brown fit into the Democratic 
nomination race? Prior to Ken-
nerly's statements indicating 
that he will make a run for the 
Presidency, Brown, I betieve, 
had a 50·50 chance of defeat-
ing Carter for the nomination. 
Without Kennedy in the race, 
Brown would have received 
enormous media attention as 
the primary challenger to Car-
ter. Now, the Kennedy-Carter 
cOlltest has relegated Brown to 
the sidelines. 

With the pressure off, Brown 
has an opportunity to build his 
image as a thoughtful, innova· 
tive, and concerned person, an 
image that will stand him in 
good stead the next time a pol. 
itical office beckons.
