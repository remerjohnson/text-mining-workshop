Religious groups ·Ieft 
without activity funds 

by Laura A. Richter 
News Editor 

Beginning Winter Quarter, no religious organizations at UCSD will be 
eligible to receive funding through Campus Activity Fee, due to the 
clarification of University policy in an Aug. 29 memo issued by Donald 
Reidhaar, General Counsel to UC. 

UCSD has improperly made yearly allocations to religious groups on 
campus "since I can remember," said Assistant Vice-chancellor of 
Student Affairs Thomas Perego-Brown. The five religious groups that 
were included in the 1977-78 budget were granted funding for Fall 
Quarter, but effective Winter Quarter, they will be denied their al1ot-
ment, pending the result of the current budget investigation. 

Specifically, the memo stated that " religious student organizations 
may be recongized and registered, but not sponsored by the University."

In addition, Reidhaar wrote that certain provisions allow the religious 
groups to hold services and activities on campus and to limit membership 
to members of the particular sect, but that the organization may not 
receive funding from any University source, including the AS.

Brown emphasized that he still encourages the free exchange of ideas 

at UCSD. " I feel that it's important that students explore different 
religions which enable them to make a more informed decision about 
their own beliefs." ,

"I had cancer of the spine and 

ensuing disabilities. They gave me 
two years to live after the 
operation. " 

That was 1962. Randy Woodard 
was 14. 

Needless to say, Woodard 
overcame __ tb~ > dire 
prognosticaUons of the aoctors, 
just as be has overcome the 
physical disabilities that are his. 
Today at age 30 he is the newly 
installed coordinator of the 
Disabled Student Services (DSS). 

tJCSD basically "getting oriented 
to the campus." 

"We've already had an ar-
chitectural barrier survey," said 
Woodard. "The University has 
received $258,000 in public works 
money for removal of barriers so 
we've tried, through surveys, to 
determine those places which 
cp.w;t be made more accessible. '! 

Saying that ' 'this campus iSn't 
that bad," Woodard cited the "too 
high pencil sharpeners" and the 
"too heavy doors" as some of the 

"inconv~niences." Perhaps of 
greater consequence though is 
''the long walk between here and 
Matthews," something that effects 
most of the as disabled students on

Woodard. "This is something the 

" A religious student organization may receive program allocations for 
programs that are open to the entire campus and have as their purpose 
the general welfare of the student body; the programs may not be for the

may personal belief accrue to the sponsoring religious student . 
organization. " 

Bernie Campbell of the UCSD Office of Religious Affairs commented 
that " thinking piously to oneself is not freedom," continuing that he feels 
that religious groups ha~e a constitutional right to expression and to 
connnunication with -. er people. 

Campbell also pointed out that with professors ~d other teachers 
expressing various religious views, and occasionally "a decidedly 
hedonistic one," a balance of expression should be maintained on the 
UCSD campus. " I'm not looking for a perfect 50-50 balance, but in the 
long run, an equitable balance should be achieved." 

Fears that the restrictive language of UC policy pertaining to religious 
groups would be expanded to include political groups were expressed by 
Kevin Eckery, Muir representative to the AS. "The logical extreme to 
which this ruling might be taken is to include any group that tries to 
change an opinion."

Handicapped Student Services at 
UC Riverside for three years and 
Director of Handicapped Student 
Services at atl State Long Beach,

Star Wars no longer fict.ion 
Pentagon prepares for Space Wars via Space Shuttle 

by Joba Markoff 
Space war-now onlx. a movie fantuy-

could add a friglaening new dimension to 
global conflict as early as the mid-198Oa. 

The Pentagon has quietly begun using the 
National AeronAtics ·and Space 
Administration's (N ItSA) new Space Shuttle 
program as a stepping stone to build a 
capability to fight a war in space. 

Military space projects are now taking up 
a significant portion of NASA's planned 
Space Shuttle missions. More .than 100 of 
these first 560 Shuttle flights will carry U.S. 
military satellites and weapons ex-
periments into orbit. 

Congressional critics such as Wisconsin 
Democrat William Proxmire have charged 
that through the Space Shuttle program, 
NASA-the civilian space agency--is 
becoming an ann of the Department of 
Defense, (DoD), increasingly subject to 
military priorities. 

Publicly, most U.S. officiala are on record 
against es:panding the arms race into space. 
In a press conference this month Secretary 
of Defense Harold Brown stated, " I would 
hope that we could keep space from 
becoming an area of active conflict." 

Space a "cIa.eIy area.' 
But some mllitary planners are excited 

about possible star wan, "Space is a dandy 
arena, actually," one DoD scientist was 
quoted as saying in a recent issue of 
Aeroaaalk:, ... .utroaaUica. " You've got 
to' attract .... &ic war off the planet. The 
notion 01-abhorrinc war in space is just plain

system for space launches," a Council 
report states , " there is a danger that in the 
future NASA programs will be orientt>d 
toward military , rather than civilian and 
scientific purposes." 

Rep. Les Aspin (Oem-Wisconsin ) has 
claimed that NASA increased the payload of 
the Shuttle from 25,000 to 65,000 pounds to 
satisfy the Air Force and that Shuttle thrust 
was increased and other technical changes 

'made in the program at the military's 
request. 

In an interview last week, Gordon Adams, 
a research associate at the Council, said 
that NASA has been placed in a po ltion 
where it must indirectly subsidize many 
DoD costs. In 1976 the Air Force refused to 
participate in funding the fourth and fifth 
Shuttle orbiters. " In effect NASA is 
carrying the charge for what they had 
originally anticipated being able to share 
with the Air Force budget," Adams stated. 

But proponents of NASA's new military 
role argue that it cooperation with the DoD 
space program Is both cost~ffective and 
vital to national s~curity. 

Major General Richard D. Henry, vice 
commander of tl e Air Force r earch and 
development agwcy for pace ystems, 
ays, "The huttle represents the next 

threshold for usint~ space for vital military 
and scientific missions. If militar pace

Do mandatory Reg Fee payments 
compromise personal morality? 

Despite the beat of Don Strebel's letter (TT-IOI5) 
and the non-5equitlD'S (TI'-IO/IO), the question of the 
morality of abortion remains intensely personal. 
One's personal morality is not in question here, if 
indeed it ever could be. The iSsue at band is wby must 
legal adults (aka students) pay for non-lnstructlonal 
services they find immoral as a condition of their 
education. 

Whether )'OU personally favor or oppose abortion, 
ask yourself how would )'OU feel if you were forced, as 
a condition of being a student, to pay a special fee to 
bave your morality violated. 

In the dark ages the doctrine ID loc:o pareatll 
declared the all-wise University had the "rigbt" , nay, 
responsibility, to control its students' lives for their 
own good. And as a consequence the Univ.ersity could 
require its students to pay for non-instructional ex-
tras vla a Registration Fee which the students had no 
control over. 

What's reaDy immoral here is the compulsory 
aspect of the Reg Fee, and thus the solUtion is to 
make the social services portion optiooal. If these 
services are truly wbat students want and need, tbey 
will gladly support such services. On the other band . 

Now in this time of enlighterunent the students are 
all legal adults, yet those who refuse to compromise 
their personal morality are denied their education. 
The Registration Fee still exists and is still 
manipulated by non-students. 

Rick Whitehill has already started a move in this 
direction by making part of your health insurance 
package (which eats up one-third of your Reg Fee) 
optional. The main danger of continuing this trend is 
that the Reg Fee bas not been reduced by a 
corresponding amount, a de facto fee increase (aka 
ripoff) . 

It's time for the Reg Fee Committee to get busy and 
right a few wrongs.

Comedian and social activist 
Gregory inspires young audience 

On Friday night. October 
fourteenth, I had the privilege of 
hearing one of the most dynamic 
Black men speak. For close to two 
hours Dick Gregory overwhelmed 
my thoughts and convictions. I 
can't ever remember being as 
enthralled by such a speaker. His 
time on the podium was spent 
without wasting one minute or a 
single breath. 

Mr. Gregory began his lecture 

with mild and agile nightclubbish 
humor. He turned us on with a few 
chuckles concerning DNA 
research (right here at bome 
brothers and sisters), cracks about 
bow the media presented the or;one 
controversy, imd a little subUe 
humor ahout how Ali's God (Allah) 
is doing his fighting for him now. 
My face lit up as his ideas became 
more enlightening to my mental 
interpretation system.

As Mr. Gregory began to warm 
up a bit, a more unique lecturer 
and comedian emerged. Thebwnor 
became more political in subject 
matter. With the transition, the 
lecturer's character changed to 
add more expression. I became 
nostalgic as he strutted around the 
podiwn, leaned on all edges of the 
lecture stand, and put his bands on 
his hips while leaning back in 
shouts. This was characteristic of 
my grandfather who was a 
southern baptist minister. Mr. 
Gregory, however, added more 
unique qualities that not only made 
him disUnct but also a con-
temporary. 

An idea expressed by Mr. 
Gregory, that I found most 
beneficial and valuable, W88 the 
need for youths in our American 
colleges to unite. He feels that if 
we were to put our energies into 
fonnulating as a constructive and 
healthy group we could change the 
system to build a better America 
that serves our purpose instead of 
the power structure's. He -stated 
that youth has the power, but the 
system deliberately keeps us 
physically and mentally 
separated. To express his attitude 
towards the power structure, Mr. 
Gregory, nicknamed it "society's 
pimp ." He expressed having a lot 
of faith in us, but he ended many 
inspirational points by remarking, 
"You young folks have a lot . of 
work to do." Some of his examples 
of the power structure's attempts 
to control us were last suouner's 
Kent State gymnasium con-
struction, the jailing of activiata 
protesting the existence of nuclear 
power plants and some 
psychological tools the system uses 
to control us.

Ambitious rockers-
Beatles of the 70's? 

by MIkel TOOIIl'" 
The Dwiglj Twilley Band have set for themBelves a lofty and possibly 

unattainable goal: they want to be the Beetles of the lWlOs. However, 
unlike the groups currenUy being hyped as the "new 8eaUes" - they 
seem to have the talent and the InteUigence to pull it off. 

On their debut albwn Sblcerely the band succeufuUy espertmented 
with styles ranging from rockabilly to folkrock, tbougb their main In-
nuence was obviously the BeaUes. All the songs were good; some were 
exceUent ("I'm Losing You," "You Were So Wann," "TV," "I'm On 
Fire"); but the album received negligible record company support and . 
few heard it. That situation prompted the band to sign with Arista for 
their second release. 

TwUley DoD'I Mind is a major step forward for the Dwight Twilley 
Band. It is as sophisticated and fully realized as their first album was 
simple and sparse, but it retains the remarkable intensity and visiQll of 
their previous effort. The nucleus of the group is fonned by 
pianist/guitarist Dwight Twilley and drummerlbassist Phil Seymour, 
who handle all the singing chores as well as sharing production credit. 
with engineer Bob Schaper. Together with lead guitarist Bill Pitcock IV 
they have developed a Wlique pop/rock fusion that is perfectly suited to 
their material . 

Twilley writes songs in the classic pop mold of the 1960s. The key to the 
band's success is that he and Seymour, both exceptional vocalists, are 
able to bring the songs to life as has no other pop group in at least a 
decade. "Chance to Get Away," "That I Remember" and especiaUy 
"Trying to Find My Baby" would have been substantial hits in the mid-
sixties, yet they are performed so energetically and believably that the 
don 't seem at all dated . 

The album's biggest triumph was its biggest risk, an attempt to stretch 
the traditional pop ballad to six minutes. Despite its length "Sleeping" is 
an incredibly intense song, made even more amazing by Seymour's 
absolutely breathtaking vocals. 

There are a few faults - there is even a bad song (that's right, one) -
but all in all Twilley Don't Mind lives up to its very ambitious intentions. 
In a t ime when rock music as a whole seems mired in mediocrity this is 
truly a work of rare quality.

~IChristmas in ctober" 
a refreshing 

by JillLGuise Bazeley 
Arts Writer 

If you haven't ever seen veteran 
actor and drama professor Eric 
Christmas do his one man show, you've 
missed the unique oppothmity of el' 
periencing education In both a funny 
and touching way, (You didn't think 
they did that at UC San Diego, did 
you? ) Even for people on their second 
and third go-round with this material, 
last weekend's "Olristmas In October" 
proved lnunensely fresh and moving. 

Under the guise of a lec-
ture /demonstr ation , Ch ristmas 
ebullienUy propounded everthing from 
his loftiest acting philosophies riglt 
down to his dirtiest jokes to a capacity 
crowd in the Mandeville Auditoriwn. 

In explaining tbe relationship of art said, " the craft should be so 
exquisite that 'it is no concern of the demonstrate this, he went through 
some small annotated sketches that Stanislavski roll over In his grave : 
" with great determination' - that pause, count to three, then walk 
on. " Then he performed the motion with great detennination. 

For the less intellectual Christmas concentrated on his 
background in English vaudeville, Shake4tnd pantomime which ' 'doesn't mean 
what you think it means. " Pantomime Christmas (as in Christ) en-
tertainment in England that takes the o[ fairy tale and Commedia 
tradition and sets them off at their somewhat in the fonn of a 
musical comedy. The result is a bawdy spoof of the aforemen-
tioned tra itions, with girls playing playing old bags (flatteringly 
known as principal dames), with girls and equaUy talenUess prin-
cesses, a demon king (of course) a with plwns in her mouth. All in 
the lamest rhyming couplets, and all , by Christmas. 

For the second act of his invited the audience to his 
"dressing room" as he went about scratch (makeup to costume to 
character) a part from Henry IV parts 1 Henry V that he played at a theatre 
in Canada. 

Christmas' understatement and his a~~lpromptu manner were only a few of 
the parts of the immense craftmsn'lhip his creation of the besotted 
character of Corporal Bardolph and the he presented through the 
evening . Just the repetition of a word word - iust Christmas saving one 
word twice was enough to bring the audience_ As for me, weU, In 
ballet we call it a brise and reverence he kicked his heels and curtseyed -
that's what I liked best of all .

Doobie l3rothers 0150 erform 

Pablo Cruise cruisin' 
by TIm Mackeazle 

Arts Editor 
San Francisco is noted for its 

special brand of rock and roll, as 
foUowers of the Dead, Jefferson 
Starship, Steve Miller and others 
know all too well . Last Saturday at 
the Sports Arena was the focus of 
two more prominent ambassadors 
of the San Francisco sound, The 
Doobie Brothers and Pa blo Cruise. 

While the show, which was a real 
treat for the audience, highlighted 
the concentrated assault of the 
Doobies, I found myself more 
impressed by the clean - sounding, 
high energy performance of Pablo 
Cruise_ Building from a strong Bay 
Area foundation, the band has 
come up with a big winner with 
their A Place In The Sun LP, 
featuring the infectious disco-like 
"Watcha Gonna Do." , 

"This one's hot," keyboardist 
Cory Lerios said with conviction. 
"There's a lot of heart and soul on 
it. DurIng the last few months, 
we'd really caught fire in our live 
perfonnances, and I think we've 
captured that intensity on the 
a1bwn, We're older, we're more 
experienced, we know who and 
what we are - and the album is an 
expression of that growth. We're 
very proud ofit." 

The most striking . thing about 
Pablo Cruise is the distinctiveness 
of their sound, which is pure 

California . You can almost see 
breakers and palm trees on a 
sunny day while listening to them -
they exude that much energy_ At 
the same time, I hope that the band 
doesn't become a seventies-style 
Beach Boys, relegating themselves 
to doing surf film souncltracks and 
the like. After all, why should they 
limit themselves? 

Pablo Cruise , highlighted by the 
guitar playing abilities of Dave 
Jenkins , demonstrated that the 
addition of new bassist Bruce Day 
(replacing Bud Cockrell ) has not 
detracted from their concert 
performances. Joining the band in 
August (he was hired through an 
ad in the paper ) , Day has 
responded to the challenge ably 
and enthusiastically. When asked 
how he was enjoying playing in the 
band, Day responded "Hey , I'm 
cruisin' ." I can't dispute that. 

The Dooble Brothers followed 
Pablo Cruise's set with a high • 
energy perfonnance of their own, 
continually bringing the audience 
to their feet. One thing you can say 
about the Doobies is that they have 
improved as a band, thanks to a 
more stylized approach to their 
music . 

Credit the addition of ex.steely 
Dan guitarist Jeff "Skunk" Baxter 
several years ago as the prime 
reason for the Doobies more in-
telligent direction.

Being disabled, Woodward 

knows some of the difficulties the 
disabled students face, but he 
quickly and vehementiy states, " I 
don't think you have to be disabled 
to relate to the disabled." As he 
sees it, the key factor is knowledge 
and understanding, " which 
anybody can gain." Pointing out 
the "general lack of knowledge 
about disabilities," Woodward 
cited some of the warped im-
pressions that the general 
populace holds toward the 
disabled. 

' 'One stereotype concerning the 
-handicapped is that they are 
mentally retarded," said Woodard. 
" People need to be aware that 
handicapped people just have 
different needs and often must do 
things in 'different' ways because 
of their disabilities." 

Woodard hopes that his job can 
bring about "some humanizing 
into the bureaucracy of the UC 
system for the disabled." Through 
such services as early enrollment, 
counseling and the keeping and 
building of a file of "volunteers and 
mobility aids," Woodard and DSS 
hope to make "an easier road for 
the disabled." 

Jobmartet 
" My ultimate priority is to get to 

know the students," said Woodard, 
urging them to seek him out in his 
Student Affairs Office . A 
pragmatist, Woodard notes the 
tigltness of the job market, but 
said, "We (the disabled) have just 
as much of a chance u you in 
geWDg a job and perfonning it 
well." 

'nlough not a " cheerleader" 
type , Woodard urges those with 
disabilities to "go for it. .. 
Admitting that "lots of people still 
won't hire the disabled," Woodard 
nonetheless cited the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 
504, which prohibits discrimination 
against disabled people-
something that should "continue to 
help matters." 

One of Wo04ard's current 
projects is the eventual establish-
ment of a career p~ and 
placement service for- the dlaabled-
~rhaps evlll internahipe with 
pay. "Such working experience 
will show the employer that the 
disabled can work~ they 
seem dubious about." 

Woodward empbuIzed the need 
for student input, 1ft both the DSS 
and the DIsabled Students Union, 
of whim he II an advlaor. "All 
stude'" are welcomed," he uid. 
"Everyone can help." 

Even with jut the openiJw of a 
door, a amile, or the lending of • 
hanel.

Mr. Gregory's thougtu on the 
Bakke declaioo were very unex-
pected for me. He feels that the 
power structure baa set up ~ 
case, purposefully, to fall on it's 
face. Some of his reasons for his 
convictions were as follows: 
Bakke's age (37 years old) waa a 
primary factor in his not being 
accepted in University of 
California u well aa five other 
colleges before the Davia Campua; 
and on the Davis campua theie 
were thirty.four other whites with 
lower grades than Bakke and 
fifteen with higher grades and 
scores. The power structure's 
motive for setting up such a case is 
to influence Africa's peoples. 
Being one of three nations 
struggling to gain Africa's 
resources, America cannot afford 
to oppress it's own Black people 
overUy.

Needless to say, I was quite 
inspired by Mr. Dick Gregory. I 
felt mentally drained after his 
lecture, but it didn't stop me from 

fig~ing the crowd to shake his 
hand and thank him. If there ever 
was a need for a powerful 
hwnanilarian, now is as good as 
any. Dick Gregory has to be one of 
the truest and most dynamic of all 
hwnan beings. Thank you, Mr. 
Gregory.
