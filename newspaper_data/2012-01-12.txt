SURF REPORT

AND JJ MAGALLON 
Staff Writers

 
   Roots, UCSD’s first vegan restaurant, 
opened Monday, Jan. 9.

According to UCSD spokesperson 
Christine Clark, the restaurant — located 
in Muir College below Pines dining hall 
— is part of a growth plan initiated 
approximately five years ago; the growth 
plan itself is part of a master plan developed 
in 2000. The plan, which included the 
2009 closures of Muir College dining hall 
Sierra Summit and Mexican restaurant 
Mercado, designated Roots as Mercado’s 
replacement.   

Housing, Dining and Hospitality wants 
the all-vegan restaurant to reflect the 
department’s commitment to serving the 
dining requests of the campus community, 
Clark said in an email.   

“It’s a healthier option for everyone,” 
Muir Senator Elizabeth Garcia said about 
Roots. 

The Stewart Commons Dining 
Renovation and Roots restaurant 
construction started Jan. 1, 2010. Pines 
dining hall, which replaced Sierra 
Summit, cost an estimated 8 million for 
its year-long construction, according to 
“Facility Design Project of the Month, 
Nov. 2010: The Pines” published Nov. 
1, 2010 in Foodservice Equipment and 
Supplies Magazine. 

According to a March 15, 2011 report 
released by UCSD Facilities Design & 
Construction, Roots cost an estimated 
$792,000 in construction fees.

The restaurant will be open Monday 
through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
and Friday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. As with 
all dining halls, the restaurant will accept 
dining dollars.  

“I think that Roots will be popular 
because Muir is located near the center of 
everything,” Garcia said. 

Aside from Roots, one more restaurant 
is scheduled to open on campus within 
the next two years. 

University Centers is in the final stages 
of approving a new Mexican restaurant 
at the Old Student Center to replace 
the Grove Café, which A.S. Council shut 
down in Spring Quarter 2010. According 
to “Admin. Consider Grove Café 
Replacement,” published Sept. 30, 2010 in 
the Guardian, the Grove Café, which was 
previously a student-run venture, left A.S.

STUDENT ACTIVISM

STUDENTS 
ORGANIZE 
“RADICAL RUSH 
WEEK”

BY NICOLE CHAN
Associate News Editor  

Students from the People’s Assembly at 
UCSD and the Student Sustainability Collective 
are hosting Radical Rush Week to strengthen 
and expand the campus activist community. 

For the event — which will run from Jan. 
11 to Jan. 18 — organizers are arranging buses 
to next week’s Jan. 19 UC Board of Regents 
meeting at UC Riverside. 
     “We want to recreate the energy we had 
when tents appeared in front of Geisel Library 
[last quarter],” Thurgood Marshall College 
senior and organizer Kevin Quirolo said. “We 
would like to get more core people who are 
really involved and not just on the sidelines. 
The central goal is creating more of an activ-
ist community. We already have one, but [we 

want] to expand the one that exists and make it 
more visible to the public eye.” 

According to Quirolo, Radical Rush Week was 
created to commemorate the 20th anniversary 
of January 15, 1992 — the date on which UCSD 
police broke into the General Store to seize 
the building after failed negotiations between 
Groundwork Books and UCSD administration. 

According to the Nov. 7, 2004 UCSD 
Guardian article “Property of UCSD?”, then-
University Center Director Jim Carruthers had 
informed Groundwork Books that it had 30 days 
to decide whether or not to become a commercial 
vendor or to be controlled by the university. 

Radical Rush Week celebrates the enduring 
Co-op Union and hopes to continue the 
development of a progressive political 
community on campus, Quirolo said. The 
week-long rush features different events at and 

around the Old Student Center, ranging from 
panel discussions at Porter’s Pub, performances, 
workshops and a documentary marathon 
at Groundwork Books. Radical Rush Week 
culminates Jan. 18 with buses leaving from 
campus to UCR for the UC Regents meeting. 

The first event, a panel on “U.S. militarization 
from Guantanamo to Home Soil,” coincides with 
an international day of action for Guantanamo 
Bay. Sociology professor Charles Thorpe, visual 
arts professor Ricardo Dominguez, literature 
and ethnic studies professor Fatima El-Tayeb 
and literature professor Luis Martin-Cabrera 
hosted the first discussion Jan. 11 at the Porter’s 
Pub. panel “Reclaim Education: Why We Must 
Act,” which continues today at Porter’s Pub.

Radical Rush Week continues with 
Disorientation Day, a quarterly event that

CSU Students Protest Reinstated Israel Study Abroad Program
BY KASHI KHORASANI
Staff Writer 

The CSU Office of International 
Programs has reinstated its study 
abroad program to Israel after an 
almost decade-long suspension. Cal 
State students at or above junior-
level standing can still submit late 
applications for the program, which 
will start sending students to the 
University of Haifa in Fall 2012.  
      CSU and UC officials froze their 
study abroad programs to Israel due 
to security concerns after the U.S. 
State Dept. issued a travel warning 
during the Second Intifada in 2002. 
Also known as the second Palestinian 
uprising, this was a period of height-
ened Palestinian-Israeli violence that 
resulted in a large amount of civilian 
casualties. 

The travel warning remains 
in effect, but CSU Director of 
International Programs Leo Van 
Cleve announced last calendar 
year that study abroad to Israel 
would be reconsidered due to pres-
sure from Jewish organizations, 
legislators and Israeli diplomats. 

     “We had an external group as well 
as our own risk assessment manager 
and our Director of International 
Programs travel to Israel and do an 
assessment of the security situation,” 

CSU Spokesperson Erik 
Fallis said. “That assess-
ment came back and it 
was felt that the excep-
tion could be made 
based on the conclu-
sions of both the exter-
nal party and our own.” 

     The UC system conducted its own 
risk assessment in 2008 and began 
sending students to Israel again in 
Fall Quarter 2009. 

Both decisions — to initially shut 
down, and later reboot the program 
— were founded only on security mat-
ters, according to Ines DeRomaña, 
UCEAP Principal Security Analyst.

“There were clearly security 
issues for several years, and then 
we were able to reinstate it in 
2009-10 when the security situa-
tion improved,” DeRomaña said.  
  In late 2009, 389 signatories 
endorsed a letter to then-UC Davis 
Vice Provost William Lacy protest-

ing the system-wide reinstatement 
on the grounds that the program 
would be inherently discriminatory 
against Muslim and Arab students. 
A similar open letter was sent to 
CSU Chancellor Charles Reed a few 
weeks ago, with endorsements from 
students, alumni, staff and some-70 
faculty members. 

This letter cited a State Dept. doc-
ument that confirms that U.S. citizens 
with Muslim or Arabic names have, 
on occasion, been given “Palestinian 
Authority Only” passport stamps. 

The letter also called for a com-
parable program in Palestine, and 
included other arguments pertaining 
to safety and limited university funds.   
     “We received the letter, but they did 
not meet with us. It did not affect the 
program’s reinstatement,” Fallis said.  
“It was solely a security decision. We 
have a policy that when a state is put 
onto a list of travel warnings by the 
US State Dept., then we do not have 
our students travelling to those loca-
tions. There is built into the policy 
the possibility of exceptions being 
made.” 

Fallis said that the sole pro-

gram to Israel will be coordinated 
by the CSU system-wide office 
with a single Israeli research uni-
versity, the University of Haifa. 
  “The university that was cho-
sen did appear to be in a more 
secure location,” Fallis said.  
Thurgood Marshall College sopho-
more Emmanuelle Berdugo studied at 
Hebrew University last quarter through 
the UC Education Abroad Program.  
   “Overall the experience was amaz-
ing; I wasn’t stopped from doing 
anything I wanted to do except for 
going to the West Bank,” Berdugo said. 
She also spoke of the mea-
sures taken at universities to 
ensure the safety of students. 
    “Even when I entered my dorm, 
I had to show my ID card. To 
enter the school you have through 
metal detectors and your back-
pack is checked,” Berdugo said. 
   According to Fallis, a CSU risk 
assessment team was also dispatched to 
Mexico late last year, but it is unknown 
how far along the process is.

Survey Showed Student Interest in New Mexican Restaurant

After three councilmembers resigned at the end of last quarter, the room seemed 
a little empty Wednesday night.

A.S. President Alyssa Wing and 
Associate Vice President of College 
Affairs Leonard Bobbit took the extra 
responsibilities 
of speaker and 
clerk respectively, 
which kept the 
meeting running 
s m o o t h l y .

A s s o c i a t e 
Vice President 
of Student 
Services Leigh 
Mason announced that, although 
it doesn’t seem so from the outside, 
CLICS is currently open as an 
available study space for students.

Engineering Senator Parminder 
Sandhu is still excited about 
engineering-on-a-stick, a free hot 
dog-on-a-stick event originally 
planned for last quarter that was 
delayed to Week Four of this quarter.

“I taste tested the product 
yesterday and it is amazing,” he said. 
“Make sure you get a lot of mustard.”

He later opened up a straw poll 
to determine the proper ratio of 
cheese-on-a-stick to hotdog-on-a-
stick, and more specifically, the ratio 
of classic cheese on a stick versus 
pepper jack cheese-on-a-stick. 

These are some major life-
changing decisions and council 
treated the issue with respect.

Wing gave an update on the 
Division I referendum, which 
students will vote on later this quarter.  

“It has gone through [the Office 
of the President],” she said. “The 
[student vote on] the referendum 
will likely be pushed back from Week 
Five, which I announced last fall.”

Vice President of Finance and 

Resources Kevin Hoang announced 
that applications have opened for 
the now-vacant Associate Vice 
President of Student Organizations. 
The former AVP, Lynne Swerhone, 
resigned last quarter following the 
approval of the Division I referendum. 

W i n g 
mentioned that 
the application 
for Associate 
Vice President 
of Local Affairs 
is also open 
after the former 
AVP Ryan 

O’Rear resigned 
for personal reasons.

The new Speaker, Jesus Romero, 
was elected Wednesday night. Vice 
Chancellor Penny Rue dropped by 
with updates about various campus 
affairs, including mid-year UC budget 
cuts of approximately $200 million.

“Mid-year revenue did not keep up 
with [the state’s] optimistic projections,” 
she said. “The mid-year cuts will be 
absorbed by UC reserves, but we will 
probably feel it in the next fiscal year.”

Councilmembers were on the edge 
of their seats when Vice President 
of Student Life Meredith Madnick 
announced the first Councilmember 
of the Week for the quarter.

“The first Councilmember 
of the Week is Associate Vice 
President of Student Advocacy 
Bryce Farrington!” Madnick said. 

Despite the traditional 
“Moves like Jagger” playing for 
him, Farrington opted for a slow 
high-five walk around the tables.

Four other members of council 
had an opportunity to strut their 
stuff in a council-wide audition to 
represent council in the Kappa 
Alpha Theta KAT walk. Work it, 
guys. Bring sexy back to council.

 Radical Rush Week, unique to 

UCSD, intends to 
increase student 
activism on campus, 
Quirolo  said.

“A lot of it is because 
there isn’t a lot of 
political consciousness 
on this campus 
compared to other UC 
campuses,” Quirolo 
said. “There may be, 
but it’s focused more 
on national events and 
not the events that 
affect us here. There 
are a lot of politics 
that affect us here, 
like the California 

government and the Regents.”

No opening date for the new venue 
has been set.

“We have designated the space 
for an authentic Mexican restaurant, 
something along the lines of a taco 
shop,” University Centers Advisory 
Board Director Sharon Van Bruggen 
said.

Van Bruggen said that the 
restaurant proposal will be 

distributed publicly as soon as 
possible, although a 2012 opening 
is unlikely.

Van Bruggen added that that 
University Centers made the 
decision to recruit a Mexican survey 
after gauging student interest via a 
survey about food options and that 
she hopes the new restaurant will 
increase traffic in the Old Student 
Center.

University Centers must obtain 
approval from the campus retail 
committee before leasing the 

space. Retail Committee takes into 
account the nearby businesses in 
order to gauge whether or not a 
new restaurant would hurt the 
existing vendors financially.  
     University Centers will then write 
a request for proposal. Once the 
proposal is approved and distributed 
publicly, restaurants can apply to 
lease the space.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, JANUARY 12,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Gov. Jerry Brown has basically given California voters an ultimatum in an attempt to 
shore up the 2012-13 state budget. 
Either we approve his proposed 
five-year $35-billion tax increase in 

the coming November elections, or 
California public school funding will 
get cut — in the form of a $4.8 billion 
slash to a strained education system. 

But these are just numbers, and 
it is difficult to see past the -illions. 
Let me put it more concretely: If 
California voters don’t vote in this tax 
increase, then the public school year 
could be shortened by a full month. 

Let’s put aside the fact that 
California public schools have 
suffered terrible budget cuts recently, 
especially after Brown’s 2011-12 
budget fiasco. And let’s also put 
aside the fact that due to this budget 
fiasco, the school system was forced 
to swallow a $330 million in cuts 
with the crucial effect of losing state 
funding for school bus services. 
Instead, let’s take a look at the other 
side — the tax increase.

Brown is betting on the fact that 
his $94-billion budget will balance 
itself once voters approve billions of 
dollars in tax hikes in November. It’s 
a budget gimmick at its very best, a 
prediction that billions of dollars of 
excess revenue will emerge out of the 
cracks of the American wallet and fix 
the budget. In short, he is crossing his 
fingers and hoping that voters care 
enough about public schools to forgo 
personal wants and needs. 

And now, reports are emerging 
that Brown’s projected tax increase is 
an over-exaggeration — a $1.5-billion 
overexaggeration.  According to the 
Legislative Analyst’s Office and the 
Los Angeles Times, Brown’s initiative 
would generate only $5.5 billion, a 
far cry from his projected $6.9-billion 
intake. He is too liberal, it seems, in 
his estimated tax intake from top-
income earners. 

This column isn’t a rant against 
politics. It’s a rant against cheap tricks 
and risky ultimatums — the result 
of bad politics. There is no quick-fix 
solution to this mess of a political 
issue, but Brown need not be married 
to the idea of this tax increase for the 
sake of a tax increase. Other options, 
pursued by more economically 
successful states like New York, center 
on tax codes designed to promote 
economic growth. It’s a plan that 
has been promoted by the state 
commission a couple years ago — a 
new one is in the works right now. It’s 
time to listen up.

So in summary: California’s 
2012-13 budget is not balanced. 
It is far from balanced. Gov. Jerry 
Brown hopes that voters will vote in 
a several billion-dollar tax increase, 
because without it, the budget will 
stay unbalanced. And to do so, he 
is threatening to make even greater 
budget cuts to an already struggling 
public school system. Schools will lose 
valuable teachers, maintenance staff, 
school buses and possibly even a full 
month of the school year.

Ultimatum

UCSD found itself the center of a racial controversy at the end of last year. The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. 
Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against 
the UCSD Medical Center on Dec. 6, 2011 for 
employment hiring practices that supposedly 
discriminate against non-U.S. citizens. 

The lawsuit claims that the medical center 
expressly required its non-citizen applicants 
to provide a green card as a verification 
of employment, though other forms of 
identification like Social Security cards or 
driver’s licenses were sufficient for U.S. citizens. 
According to the nationwide Immigration 
and Nationality Act, anti-discrimination laws 
prevent employers from placing unnecessary 
verification burdens on potential employees due 
to national origin or citizenship.

In response to the lawsuit, the UC San 
Diego Medical Center settled, agreeing to pay 
$115,000 in a civil penalty charge but more 
importantly, to implement new hiring practices 
free of discrimination from nationality or 
citizenship. In addition to supplemental human 
resources training for their personnel, the 

department is set to ensure that compliance 
with employment eligibility verification extends 
to the rest of the University of California.

It is certainly a win on the employee 
discrimination front, but the financial effects 
of having newly hired non-citizens turn out to 
be illegal immigrants provides more negative 
consequences for the state than good. A study 
from the Federation for American Immigration 
Reform claims that illegal immigrants cost 
the state $10.5 billion a year. These kinds of 
consequences are the reason why the center is 
so stringent with application documentation 
in the first place, but that does not make such 
discriminatory practices acceptable. 

What is important is that these violations 
of federal discriminatory law do not happen 
again in UC campuses or elsewhere. These laws 
were put there for a reason — to give potential 
job seekers with non-citizen credentials a 
fair chance in the job market. Employment 
eligibility verification ought to be standardized 
across the board based on proof of residency — 
citizenship cards or green cards — in order to 
keep the field level.

Medical Center Hiring Practices Need to be Standardized for Non-Citizens

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is flaring up again. A petition was placed on the desk of the California State University 
Chancellor last month claiming that an Israel 
study abroad option is an endorsement of 
apartheid. This letter — signed by 81 CSU faculty 
members and 46 students and alumni — cites 
concerns over safety, discrimination, budget 
cuts and political issues related to the lack of an 
equivalent study abroad program in Palestine. 
These are legitimate concerns of student 
protection and funding that exist for many 
other travel abroad programs, but not enough 
to prevent thousands of students from seeking 
a first-hand education in Israel. The issue of the 
Israel-Palestine conflict is extremely complex, 
but if there is a demand to study in Israel, CSU 
should allow its students to pursue it in the name 
of education. CSU initially brought the Israel 
study abroad program to a halt in 2002 because 
the country landed on the U.S. State Department’s 
travel-warning list. The petition that came 
out in early December insists that students 
face dangers in Israel, citing events where one 
American student lost an eye and another was 
killed in 2010, though they were not in Israel as 
part of study abroad programs. While these are 
unfortunate instances, the issue of safety goes 
deeper because there are other factors to consider.

Safety is a concern for many study abroad 
destinations — some arguably more dangerous 
than Israel. To go on a study abroad trip is an 
inherently dangerous decision — from diseases, 
to crime, to the naïveté that comes with living 
in a foreign country. Dr. Samuel Edelman, 
executive director of Scholars for Peace in the 
Middle East, insists that the idea that Israel is 
unsafe for students is a way to de-legitimize 
the country. Statistics on the safety of different 
abroad programs are difficult to come by, as 
many students live at universities not affiliated 
with their U.S. college. Yet, every country has its 
horror stories, such as a University of Colorado 
student who contracted a serious case of E. coli 
in India in 2005, a Barnard College student 
who was raped in Mexico in 2001 and three 
St. Mary’s College students who were attacked 
while studying in Guatemala in 1998. Therefore, 
if universities cut off ties with every abroad 
destination that threatened a student’s safety, 
students wouldn’t manage to cross any borders. 

Additionally, the CSU isn’t planning on 
sending their students over to Israel with no 
support — instead, the system sent its director 
of international programs and its risk assessment 
manager to the country to scope out the safety 
of the current environment. The University of 
California did its own safety assessment and was 

able to reopen the travel abroad program in 2009. 
As long as safety measures are taken and students 
understand the possible dangers, CSU students 
should have the option of studying in Israel.

And the reality is, students do want the 
option. According to the most recent Open 
Doors data (generated by the Institute of

abroad in Israel increased 60.7 percent from the 
2008-09 academic to 2009-10. Currently, Israel is 
pushing 17th place for most popular study abroad 
location, with 3,146 American students visiting in 
the 2009-10 academic year.

There is value to be derived from studying 
in a historically rich place like Israel, which 
also holds the title of being the only democratic 
country in the Middle East. One major 
complaint addressed in the petition against the 
abroad program was that students could face 
discriminatory treatment in Israel based on race 
and ethnicity. This is a reality, but a school system 
should not hold a student back from studying in 
a country where human rights violations occur, 
because traveling abroad can be an essential 
opportunity to move out of one’s comfort 
zone and experience how the other half lives. 
Discrimination occurs in every country, which

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, JANUARY 12,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5

Dear Editor,
 The position taken by today’s 

editorial “The Fine Print” is repre-
hensible to say the least. I’m hoping 
its central location on the opinion 
page does not signify its endorse-
ment by the Guardian’s Editorial 
Board. The author implies that dis-
crimination against transgender and 
gay employees is OK if there will 
be more Carl’s Jr.s in California. It 
boggles my mind that the Guardian 
would allow such statements to be 
printed. I’m used to disagreeing with 
libertarians, but this was just too 
much. There’s a pretty simple solu-
tion to not paying for discrimination 
lawsuits: Don’t discriminate.

 Furthermore, I do hope that 
when all of you undergraduates 
(including the author) graduate, you 
find a job that provides government-
required benefits and aren’t fooled 
into taking a job as an “independent 
contractor” just because the CEO 
doesn’t want to cut into his bonus. 
Why be “pro-business” if doing so 
only helps the few at the top, which 
most of you will never be? Being 
pro-economy necessarily requires 
being pro-worker.

In conclusion, I’m sorry to say 
that these regulations don’t just 
“sound appealing,” they are ethically 
mandatory.

Dear Editor,
Students at Phillips Academy 

Andover can take four classes per 
semester in high school only if three 
of them are AP. Otherwise, they take 
five classes, and a few, with permis-
sion, take six. Over 300 students 
from that prestigious prep school 
alone matriculated at Harvard or 
Yale over the past decade (an aver-
age of 15 at each per graduating 
Andover class).

Other Andover students include, 
on average per graduating class: 
12 matriculating at Stanford; 11 at 
U Penn; 10 at Columbia; nine at 
Princeton; eight at Georgetown, 
Duke and Brown; seven at Cornell, 
Johns Hopkins and Dartmouth; 
six at U Southern Cal, Tufts, and 
Amherst; five at NYU, Boston U, 
U Chicago, MIT and Washington 
U-St Louis; four at Trinity College 
(Conn.), Carnegie Mellon U, 
Middlebury College, Boston College, 
and Geo. Washington (D.C.); three 
at Vanderbilt U, Northwestern U, 
Tulane U, Bowdoin College and U 
Michigan (Ann Arbor).

Mindless racking-up-of-points 
to skip the freshman year isn’t as 
important as gaining admission.

Some California public high 
schools over-emphasize quantity — 
for example, North Hollywood High 
has had students take with them 20, 
21 or even 22 AP tests scoring 4 or 5 
to UCLA or Cal.

Worker Protections 
Are Not Optional

must mean the true area of contention is the political 
implication that comes with an American university system 
endorsing trips to Israel. 

  This is a matter of academic freedom — the freedom 
for students to study and experience worlds outside of 
their own. David Klein, a mathematics professor at CSU 
Northridge and the man spearheading the petition, says the 
fact that CSU can actively cut ties with “institutions that 
participate in apartheid” is in fact an exercise of academic 
freedom. He rationalizes this statement by comparing it 
to the United States preventing its students from traveling 
to Nazi Germany during World War II. Ultimately, the 
Israel-Palestine conflict is such a complicated issue that it 
is difficult to determine what is correct. Many countries 
have political enemies (for instance, we have study abroad 
programs in Seoul, but not Pyongyang) and there are not 
arguments about why there aren’t programs in both sides 
of those conflicting states — therefore, the demand for 

equal programs in Palestine and Israel is an overreaching 
request. There are some ways that CSU students could still 
travel abroad to Israel without the school system showing 
a preference of Israel over Palestine. According to Adrian 
Beaulieu, dean of international studies at Providence 
College, it has been a common trend since 2004 for 
universities to put bans on study abroad trips to Israel, but 
students can get around the bans by fulfilling requirements, 
such as gathering signatures for specialized waivers. Stacey 
Tsantir at the University of Minnesota, explains that 
petitions to study in Israel are one of the most common 
and are often approved. Therefore, CSU could essentially 
ban trips to Israel without stifling those who are especially 
committed to the journey.

 It is most important to make sure that the students are 
properly educated in order to make an informed choice on 
studying in Israel. It shouldn’t matter if 81 faculty members 
are against the program — the choice has to come from the 
students.

“Midnight in Paris” isn’t Woody Allen’s best, but it just might be his most fun. While wan-
dering the streets of modern-day Paris, a down-on-his-luck screenwriter (Owen Wilson) 
hitches a ride aboard a time-traveling stagecoach to a prohibition-era soirée hosted by 
F. Scott Fitzgerald. From there, he shoots the shit with Hemingway, submits his novel to 
Gertrude Stein, falls in love with Picasso’s muse and has a particularly memorable run-in 
with Salvador Dalí (a show-stealing Adrian Brody) among many others. �e result is

The Artist

Somewhat of a curveball coming from the lead actor-director team behind “OSS 117”: 
Austin Power’s more subtle, more French counterpart “�e Artist” proved not only a fond 
love letter to the golden silent era of �lm, but one of the most beautifully composed and 
perfectly cast showbiz �lms of the last decade. Amidst this year’s sea of high-budget, high-
tech critical darlings, “�e Artist” reveled in minimalism — reinforcing the sheer power 
of profound singular images (Jean Dujardin’s downtrodden antihero George Valentin is 
consumed by quicksand in a scene from a box o�ce �op), adventurous storytelling, and, 
of course, the incomparable artists themselves — an ensemble seemingly plucked from 
1920s Hollywood helmed by John Goodman, James Cromwell, Berenice Bejo and the im-
mensely talented Dujardin. (RE)

If you didn’t think So�ie “�e Notebook” Gosling could transform into a shotgun-toting, en-
gine-revving, head-stomping badass, you were dead wrong. Insert “Bronson” director Nicolas 
Winding Refn’s eye for style and passionate love for American car-fetish exploitation �lms of 
the 1970s and a strangely unnerving villain courtesy of Albert Brooks, and you’ve got a match 
made in action pulp heaven. Admittedly, there’s nothing all that smart about “Drive” (save for 
a certain instant-classic kiss scene), but that’s precisely what made it so refreshing. And with 
gripping performances from all parties and a near perfect score (Kavinsky’s excellent “Night-
call” conjuring images of leather interiors and purple neon-lit overpasses long a�er you’ve le� 
the theater), brains are simply better le� splattered on Ryan Gosling’s boot heel. (RE)

See FILMS, page 8

Some 50 feature �lms into his tremendously in�uential career, Werner Herzog, master 
of the documentary, shows no signs of easing. “Into the Abyss” pro�les Michael Perry, a 
Texas death row inmate responsible for a senseless triple homicide during a carjacking. 
Aside from the �lm’s stark, “In Cold Blood”-esque objectivity and illuminating interviews 
with not only the accused and the victimized but also the families, friends, accomplices, 
lovers, law enforcement and lethal injection technicians involved, “Into the Abyss” is 
above all else a con�rmation of Herzog’s expert storytelling and willingness to stray from 
the dramatic web of accusation and loss that is the criminal justice system, focusing in-
stead on the hopes and poetic humanity of the condemned. (RE)

BEST
SONGS
“Countdown” - Beyonce

�ere’s not a lot of monogamy on the pop charts these days (just a lot of 
crotches, courtesy of Rihanna and LMFAO), which is what makes Beyonce’s 
marital bliss on “Countdown” such a joy to hear. In a playful paradox, the 
singer proclaims her loyalty to her man (You’re still the one I need / I will 
always be with you) over music that’s far less uni�ed, throwing in a random 
assortment of sounds dating back from the ’70s to the ’90s, including a 
Boyz II Men sample, afrobeat horns and schizo drumlines. (AS)

“Holocene” - Bon Iver
“Holocene” is the kind of sublime acoustic song everyone can cry to. It’s 
elusive — bandleader Justin Vernon’s falsetto is mostly unintelligible and 
many lines sound like they should end in an ellipses (the chorus-closer “I 
could see for miles, miles, miles”) — but the movement of the rising and 
falling chords make it the perfect song for a lost highway. (AS)

“County Line” - Cass McCombs

Cass McCombs has raked in the Dylan comparisons over the course of 
his quiet career, and “County Line” — the organic and minimal Nashville 
Skyline-like ballad o� this year’s fantastic Wit’s End — has become prime 
evidence among critics. But beneath the creeping bassline, liquid organ 
bliss and paper-thin drumbeat lies the wrenching croon and surreal imag-
ery of a con�dent artist all his own. (RE)

“Bay Of Pigs” - Destroyer
“Ambient disco” is not necessarily a genre known for infectious music (or, for 
that matter, existing), but 2011 was just that kind of year. �e 11-plus minute 
closer on Destroyer’s blissfully bougie Eurotrip Kaputt builds slow-moving 
synth ambience under Dan Bejar’s abstract poetry to a psychedelic sing-a-long 
groove, falling comfortably between high art and radio gold. (RE)

BEST ALBUMS
Bon Iver, Bon Iver - Bon Iver                                                                              

Bon Iver, Bon Iver is the perfect example of a band using their sophomore album to establish their aesthetic while 
managing to evolve their sound in the process. Containing everything from abstract folk to one of the year’s sincerest 
attempts at so� rock (the inevitably upli�ing “Beth / Rest”), Bon Iver represents one of the most well-developed folk al-
bums released in quite some time. Bon Iver is also home to an inimitable anthemic quality, with tracks like “Holocene” 
and “Perth” standing out as some of the most TV drama soundtrack-ready songs of the year. Bon Iver never succumbs 
to saccharine emotionalism though, with Justin Vernon’s abstract, o�en perplexing lyrics providing the perfect accom-
paniment to all the melodic poignancy. (AW)

What do you get when you combine a warbly, heavily accented voice, sparse keyboard work, and the occasional o�-kilter 
drum machine? Surprisingly, the most innovative electronic album of 2011. Re�ning his blend of emotive pop, minimal 
R&B and skittering electronic manipulations, Blake managed to meet (if not exceed) the hype created by his astounding 
string of EPs in 2010. On songs like “I Mind” and “To Care (Like You),” Blake engages in the kind of skewed, almost dance 
�oor-ready abstraction that made his early EPs such revelations. Whether he’s cooing daintily (as on the ethereal “Lindis-
farne” suite) or dropping beats, Blake consistently imbues his music with the kind of anything-goes attitude towards compo-
sition so o�en absent in recent dance music. (AW)

�e record in 2011 most capable of evoking a speci�c aesthetic space was without a doubt Destroyer’s excellent Kaputt. 
Meditative ambient dri�, disco rhythms, and a variety of delightful woodwind solos provide the perfect foggy bed for Bejar’s 
poetic, o�en absurd ramblings. �is is a substantial change for Bejar, whose earlier albums tended towards either jangly rock 
or theatrical computer-driven soundscapes.  Particularly remarkable is Bejar’s willingness to cede key emotional moments 
to his talented studio band: Many of Kaputt’s �nest moments can be found in the ambient synthwork or the aforementioned 
woodwind solos. �ese elements all combine to create one of 2011’s most complete, masterful sonic experiences. (AW)

“Niggas In Paris” - Jay-Z and Kanye West
“What’s 50 grand to a mothafucka like me?” asks Jay-Z in Kanye West col-
laboration “Niggas In Paris” — a line that would make any Occupy Wall 
Street protester shake a �st. Fortunately, it’s hard to be resentful when the 
stars are having so much stupid fun — emphasis on the stupid. Exhibit 
A: Kanye rhymes “Jay” with “�sh �llet.” Exhibit B: �e comedy “Blades of 
Glory” is sampled — twice. Clearly, intelligence isn’t their game. Instead, 
being stoked o� wealth and fame is, and it’s a lot more fun that way. (AS)

“You Can Count On Me” - Panda Bear
�ough Panda Bear’s Tomboy hardly lives up to his 2007 release Person 
Pitch, album highlight “You Can Count On Me” had the year’s best vocal 
melodies not already re-released by the Beach Boys. (AS)

“Lotus Flower” - Radiohead
�om Yorke usually sounds freaked out, but on “Lotus Flower” he breaks 
out his inner Prince and gets sexy. In a dreamy falsetto he describes un-
furling with a woman like lotus �owers (whatever that means), with only 
double-tracked drums and a handclap here and there disrupting the �ow; 
for once, the focus is solely on the groove. (AS)

James Blake - James Blake                                                                             

Kaputt - Destroyer                                                                           

Take Care - Drake                                                                          

At a time when everyone from Common to the fake Ghostface Killah blog seems to be convinced of Drake’s inadequacy as a 
rapper, it’s universally surprising that Drake would be the source of one the year’s best hip-hop albums. On Take Care, Drake 
skillfully shi�s between sparse, dark R&B introspection (“Shot For Me,” “Marvin’s Room”) and more straightforward rap 
tracks like the excellent Rick Ross collaboration “Lord Knows.” Even on the album’s more ambitious songs (see the Jamie xx-
sampling title track), Drake proves his skill in any environment, displaying a versatility rare among rappers these days. (AW)

The Muppets
You’d be forgiven for thinking that a Muppets reboot, 12 years a�er the last 
veritable yet critically lukewarm theatrical e�ort “Muppets from Space,” might 
not exactly be a sure�re family winner for the digital age. But the duty of 
breathing life into these lovable puppets’ dusty vaudevillian humor could not 
have been placed in better hands. �e glowing (human) costars Jason Segel 
and Amy Adams, Segel’s own charming and consistently hilarious script, a 
few relentlessly catchy show-stoppers penned by Flight of the Conchords’ Bret 
McKenzie and a load of phenomenal cameos (never again will you witness 
Zach Gala�anakis singing with the voice of Joanna Newsom) all land “�e 
Muppets” a bright spot alongside the best of Henson’s cherished oeuvre. (RE)

Tree Of Life
�ough critics panned “Tree of Life” for its sheer overreaching ambition (ex-
hibit A: an extended sequence chronicling the creation of the universe takes 
us on an detour to a world of CGI dinosaurs and single-celled amoebae), Ter-
rence Malick’s return-to-form a�er his �ve-year hiatus can hardly be called an 
artistic �op. Brad Pitt and Sean Penn deliver expectedly brilliant performances 
and Malick’s breathtaking photography (understatement) and non-linear nar-
rative so e�ortlessly capture the pitfalls of machismo and disjointed memories 
of childhood loss. Most captivating, however, is the simple story of these kids 
— the most realistic and emotionally spot-on portrait of brotherhood I’ve 
experienced in the theater. (RE)

MORE BEST SONGS
▶ SONGS from page 7

“Are You…Can You…Were You (Felt)” – Shabazz Palaces
Shabazz Palaces is full of contradictions. Discordant beats mix with top-
pling piano chords, creating a sound that would be totally chaotic if not for 
the easy �ow of ’90s jazz-rap legend Ishmael Butler (Digable Planets), who 
uni�es the track with one cool refrain — “It’s a feeling!” Indeed, and the 
best hip-hop of 2011. (AS)

“Bizness” – tUnE-yArDs
Be jealous, Adele; though she won’t be featured on “Vh1 Divas” anytime 
soon, tUnE-yArDs’ Merrill Garbus has a voice that’s impossible to ignore. 
On “Bizness” she aims for every note — from deep croons to a symphony 
of short, high-pitched yelps — giving every second of the track at least a 
taste of her soulful wails. (AS)

Father, Son, Holy Ghost - Girls                                                                         
A cherished lo-� band’s transition to a polished, high �delity sound is always a dicey prospect, particularly for a group as 
thoroughly hyped as San Francisco’s Girls. On Father, Son, Holy Ghost, their sophomore album, Girls defy this tendency, 
taking advantage of their cleaner sound to create one of 2011’s most well-cra�ed rock albums. What makes the album 
so exceptional is Girls’ ability to evoke diverse facets of rock music’s past (notice the contrast between the Queens of the 
Stone Age-evoking “Die” and the airy folk of “Just a Song”) without ever sounding uninspired or overly referential. (AW)

Smoke Ring For My Halo - Kurt Vile                                                                         
In a year whose best albums were o�en characterized by glittery synthesizers, R&B crooning and saxophone, Kurt 
Vile was perhaps the staunchest defender of traditional, no-bullshit American rock & roll. On tracks like “Society 
is My Friend” and “Runner Ups,” Vile pairs lush layers of guitar with his gritty, pessimistic drawl. His loose sense of 
composition and keen ear for melody make Smoke Ring for My Halo almost endlessly re-listenable. (AW)

Space is Only Noise - Nicolas Jaar
Pairing minimal techno’s a�nity for sound design and rhythmic experimentation with a skewed pop sensibility reminis-
cent of peer Matthew Dear, Space is Only Noise represents one of the most exciting of 2011’s large crop of dance crossover 
records. �at it is such a success is in part due to Jaar’s relentless e�ort to �ll every inch of his compositions with atmo-
sphere. Even when instrumentation is at its most minimal (see the standout “Space is Only Noise if You Can See”), Space 
is replete with synthesizer texture, fascinating samples and almost unnoticeable rhythmic subtleties. (AW)

Black Up - Shabazz Palaces
From the stark, hipster-baiting “PBR&B” of Frank Ocean and �e Weeknd to the loose, absurdist update of Southern rap 
championed by A$AP Rocky and Main Attraktionz, 2011 saw a lot of hip-hop’s boundaries being challenged. None were 
as revolutionary as Shabazz Palaces, whose blend of dusty jazz samples (a relic of rapper Ishmael Butler’s days in Digible 
Planets), the damp sonic experimentation of UK dubstep, and neo-tribal Africanisms made for some of the most strik-
ingly unique music of the year. Equally stunning are Butler’s lyrics, which �oat e�ortlessly between abstraction, clever 
wordplay, and mysticism. �roughout Black Up, which morphs continuously due to Butler’s refusal to linger too long on 
any one musical idea, Shabazz Palaces prove themselves to be one of the most creative, free-spirited bands of 2011. (AW)

House of Balloons - The Weeknd
Over the course of three remarkably consistent albums, Toronto’s �e Weeknd quickly became one of the year’s most 
fascinating (and o�en mysterious) new artists. �ough all three 2011 releases are excellent, it’s on House of Balloons, the 
�rst part of the trilogy, that �e Weeknd does the best job at creating the dark, druggy R&B on which they made their 
name. On tracks like the moody “�e Morning” or the depraved two-part epic “House of Balloons / Glass Table Girls,” 
singer Abel Tesfaye spins desperate tales of drug abuse and sexual manipulation over spacious, atmospheric R&B. What’s 
most remarkable is the extent to which Tesfaye uses the three albums to create a remarkably cohesive narrative presence, 
hammering out a complete persona that makes his work absolutely captivating. (AW)

Smother - Wild Beasts
2011’s most underrated album belongs to falsetto-loving UK pop quartet Wild Beasts. �ough it was far more restrained 
than their 2009 near-classic Two Dancers, this year’s Smother showcased the band’s keen ear for composition, as well 
as their ability to evoke a great deal of tension with a minimal palate. Each song on the album, from the lusty stomp of 
“Plaything” to “Loop the Loop”’s, heartsick musings, uses the same set of sparse musical tools: tasteful guitar, deliberate 
drumming, and the occasional synthesizer or piano line buried relatively low in the mix. In spite of their Spartan musical 
ingredients, Wild Beasts use excellent songwriting chops and R&B’s sense of vocal drama to create one of the year’s most 
re�ned, emotionally visceral albums. (AW)



9 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, JANUARY 12,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

THE BEST OF THE REST
BEST TV SHOW
Breaking Bad

�ere is something innately satisfying about watching someone go evil. 
�ere is something even more satisfying about watching Bryan Cranston of 
“Malcolm in the Middle” fame discover the depths of his capacity to poison 
kids and plant bombs in order to get exactly what he wants. Four seasons in, 
and the show considered “Weeds” on, well, meth has continued to show o� its 
ability to produce more stunning cinematography, exuberant acting and witty 
dialogue in each 45-minute episode than lesser dramas could produce in an 
entire season. 

It’s a series that doesn’t take itself too seriously, the murders and tortures 
and meth aside. Even when the season villain Gus (played with particular 
aplomb by Giancarlo Esposito) gets half of his face blown o� by a bomb, 
he manages to casually step out of the room and straighten his tie before 
crumpling to his death in a completely disgusting, nearly funny display of 
justice. “Breaking Bad” certainly knows how to send its villains out with style, 
until that is, you realize the show’s greatest villain is still alive. It’s now just the 
protagonist. 

BEST NEW ARTIST
Kendrick Lamar

Cut from the same cloth as Big Boi’s Sir Lucious Le� Foot and Kanye’s 
landmark My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Kendrick Lamar’s debut Sec-
tion.80 proved much more than well-funded imitation. Like Kanye, Lamar’s 
work brims with ambition: he weaves his dynamic stories through the 
interjections of a mysterious �reside narrator, and his production is big and 
bold — full of samples and unexpected vocal melodies, o�en resembling 
fully developed songs rather than mere beats. 

Surprising however, and unlike Kanye, Lamar does not concern himself 
with maintaining stale rap conventions of narcissism and wealth, instead 
rapping about ethnic lines, apathy, self-medication and the disillusionment 
of Reagan-era youth. Even more surprising: it isn’t corny — a mark that can 
be attributed to Lamar’s cutting-edge hip-hop sensibilities, and the simple 
fact the guy is damn smart. Who knew some of the year’s most intellectu-
ally gratifying lyrics and drippiest weed jams would come from the same 
album? 

Kendrick did, of course. “You wonder how I could talk about money, 
hoes, clothes, God and history all in the same sentence,” he spits on elec-
trifying jazz closer “Ab-Souls Outro.” If this is hip-hop’s new direction, get 
excited. 

INSTRUMENT OF THE YEAR
Saxophone

One of 2011’s most 
surprising musical 
developments was the 
emergence of the saxo-
phone as an omnipres-
ent feature of many of 
the year’s best albums. 
From the wild, glee-
ful squeals on M83’s 
“Midnight City” to 
the plaintive, medita-
tive solos that decorate 
Destroyer’s monumental 
Kaputt, the sax was 
an almost inescapable 
part of 2011’s musical 
landscape. Even the 
previously-withdrawn 
Bon Iver joined in the 
sax frenzy, employing 
avant-jazz baritone sax 
master Colin Stetson to 
contribute to many of 
Bon Iver, Bon Iver’s �n-
est moments. Everyone 
from Lady Gaga (on the 
ridiculous “Edge of Glo-
ry”) to indie pop weirdo 
Eleanor Friedberger 
(see “My Mistakes”) 
indulged in a little sax 
action, contributing to 
the formerly-maligned 
instrument’s ba�ing 
(but welcome) rise to 
prominence.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, JANUARY 12,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 11

Looking for a great pharmacy school?

Look no 
further than 

the University of
Michigan.

Meet some alumni of California universities who recently enrolled 
as University of Michigan PharmD students. 1. Financial support unequalled by any

other U.S. pharmacy school.
2. Outstanding pay.
3. Job security in economically uncertain

times.
4. Unlimited opportunities to improve

people’s lives.
5. Unparalleled career choices.
6. Continuous growth potential.
7. Life and career mobility.

8. The prestige of owning a degree from
one of America’s top-ranked pharmacy
schools.

9. Membership in an influential alumni
network spanning the globe.

10. The power to apply medical knowl-
edge at the forefront of technological 
innovation.

11. Small class size to maximize individual-
ized educational experiences.

12. One-to-one learning with world-
renowned faculty.

Every year, UCSD graduates choose the PharmD Program at the Universityof Michigan College of Pharmacy. In fact, nearly 20 percent of ourPharmD enrollment is comprised of alumni from California universities. 
What accounts for Michigan’s popularity among Golden Staters? First, 

we are consistently ranked among America’s top pharmacy schools. Secondly,
we consider a lot more than GPA and PCAT scores when evaluating your
application.

Earn your bachelor’s degree at UCSD, and then earn your PharmD at U-M.
That’s what many UCSD students do every year.

To learn more about the PharmD Program at Michigan, visit our Web site at
www.umich.edu/~pharmacy. Or contact the College of Pharmacy at 734-764-7312 or
at mich.pharm.admissions@umich.edu.

Still looking for a reason to make Michigan your pharmacy school? Consider these:

Your future never looked brighter.

Olympic training center, and clocked 
times fast enough to make the Sri Lankan 
National Team. Running in the Asian 
Athletics Championships in Japan, Merrill 
won the Bronze Medal with a time of 
56.83 to solidify her spot in the 2011 
World Championships in Daegu, Korea. 
There she ran a 57.05, her second fastest 
career time, but failed to make the finals. 
Now, Merrill continues to train with U.S. 
Olympian Sheena Tosta in Chula Vista, 
where both athletes are preparing for a run 
at the 2012 London Olympics — all this 
from an athlete who nearly saw her college 
career come to a close after being forced to 
undergo reconstructive surgery to repair a 
torn ACL her freshman year. 
    Merrill is not the only Triton to graduate 
and continue training. Linda Rainwater, 
UCSD’s school record holder in the high 
jump at 5’10.5”, continues to train in 
preparation for the U.S. Trials. Rainwater 
became the NCAA Division II Champion 
in the high jump in 2010 and the national 
champion in the heptathlon in 2008. Since 
graduating in 2010, she has been working 
as a volunteer coach for the UCSD track 
team. 
     Kelly Fogarty and Stephanie LeFever 
joined Rainwater as assistant coaches 
upon graduating in 2011. Fogarty was only 
tenths of a second off the U.S. Nationals 
Qualifier last year with a time of 11.52 
in the 100m school record and her 23.55 
school record in the 200m. Fogarty also 
garnered All-American her senior year. 
LeFever came in second last year at the 
NCAA National Championships in both 
the high jump and the heptathlon. Her 
long jump distance was within three inches 
of qualifying for the Olympic Trials.
    The dedication and ability shown by 
our alumni is indicative of our school 
becoming an academic as well as an 

athletic presence. UCSD is showing signs 
of becoming much more than our popular 
bumper sticker: “The smart ones.” We have 
as much to boast about our brawn as our 
brains. 
     Our athletic program is evolving 
into something bigger than Division II 
athletics, a division that is becoming more 
and more obsolete. 
     UCSD is becoming good enough to 
stand toe-to-toe with the big dogs of 
Division I.  We have the coaches, like Brian 
McManus and his perennially competitive 
women’s soccer team, Charity Elliot with 
her No. 2-ranked women’s basketball team 
and Patti Gerkins leading our softball team 
to a 2011 NCAA National Championship.
     Senior Alex Henley, who picked up her 
third NCAA Championship title last year, 
was nominated for Division-II Athlete of 
the Year honors and is looking for more 
national titles this year in addition to an 
Olympic dream. I myself am a two time-
reigning NCAA Champion in the javelin, 
and I am determined to take another 
national title on my way to competing at 
the London Olympics.
    The outside world has already taken 
notice of the ground-breaking research 
that UCSD is doing — they may soon be 
recognizing the university for the athletes 
it’s producing. 
     Unfortunately, our student body doesn’t 
seem to realize how good we really are, 
and how good we will be in the future. 
For a glimpse of UCSD’s athletic prowess, 
check out the No. 2 nationally ranked 
women’s basketball team this Saturday 
against the only other undefeated team in 
the CCAA. A win on Friday will signal the 
best starting record ever for the Tritons, 
and more widely may signal to the student 
body that our athletic department is 
something to be proud of.

     In the campaign, Eberts led the Tritons with 
a match-high 14 kills, along with three service 
aces and five assists. Brunsting did well in 
directing the offense, setting up opportunities 
for Andrullis, who finished with six kills, and 
junior opposite Johl Awerkamp, who recorded 
eight kills.    
      “After some adjustments on our part we 
came back and beat Hawaii in three sets the 
second night, earning our first ever victory 
over the Univ. of Hawaii in Hawaii,” Ring said. 
“It was a nice confidence boost for this team 
to get an MPSF road victory so early in the 
season.”  
     On Wednesday, Jan. 11, No. 14 Loyola-
Chicago swept the Tritons in their first official 
home game of the season. 
     In the first set, the Tritons raced out to 
a 6-1 lead off three consecutive points from 
Lennon. But the momentum then swung to 
Loyola-Chicago’s side, as the Ramblers ended 
the set 21-25.   
     UCSD kept it close in the second set, going 
down 23-25, and forced the overtime in the 
third set, although UCSD faltered defensively 
and ultimately fell 25-27. 
     The Tritons were just edged in kills, with 
the Ramblers tallying 40 to the Tritons’ 37.  But 
UCSD really struggled on its side of the net. 
The Tritons committed 22 errors to Loyola-
Chicagos’ 13.    
     Lennon led the Tritons in the attack with 13 
kills, a season high for the sophomore, while 
fellow sophomore Brady put up substantial 
figures, with nine kills on two errors. But 
UCSD’s normal standout, junior Eberts had a 
difficult night, ending the game with a -.071 
hitting percentage, recording seven kills on 
nine errors. The loss drops the Tritons back 
down to .500.
     UCSD will now look to bounce back, as 
the players hit the road in preparation for 
two more non-league matches in the Grand 
Canyon tournament to be held in Phoenix, 
Ariz. 

     On Saturday, Jan. 14, the Tritons face the 
New Jersey Institute of Technology and on 
Sunday, Jan. 15, UCSD will take on the hosts, 
Grand Canyon University.
     The Tritons’ next MPSF match will be 
against the top team in the country, No. 1 UC 
Irvine, but Ring says UCSD is all too excited 
for the bout.
     “That’s the challenge and excitement of 
competing in the MPSF conference,” Ring said. 
“We face the best night after night.”

Tritons to Play in Grand Canyon Tournament Olympic Goals for UCSD Postgrads

This season, the men’s volleyball team goes forward after graduating Phil Bannan, who head coach Kevin Ring 
called “probably the best player we’ve ever 
had.” 
     Bannan — All-MPSF Second Team 
selection as well as UCSD school record 
holder in assists and service aces — is 
replaced by sophomore setter Mike 
Brunsting, brother of senior All-American 
UCSD outside hitter Roxanne Brunsting. 
The sophomore leads the Tritons with 77 
assists this season. 
     “New players, either returners who 
played a back-up role the previous year or 
new players to this year’s squad are now 
put in a position where they can take the 

reins,” Ring said. “Mike Brunsting, a back-
up setter last season, is now our starting 
setter. Sebastian Brady started last year as 
a freshman, but with Calvin Ross finishing 
his eligibility we now have Greg Smith and 
Fred Stahl geared up and ready to play the 
middle blocker position.”
     In 2012, UCSD will contend with 
inexperience while in one of the most 
competitive conferences in the country. 
With only one senior on the roster, 
UCSD’s starting seven is made up of five 
underclassmen and two juniors — freshmen 
Chris Andrullis and Kevin McGinnis, 
sophomores Mike Brunsting, Vaun Lennon 
and Sebastian Brady. 
     “Where there is a lack of match 
experience there is also a level of ‘youthful’ 
exuberance,” Ring said. “I like the hard work 
and dedication of the guys on this year’s 

squad. We want to raise our ‘low end’ level 
of play, at the same time working to raise 
the bar for how well we can play.  If we 
can do both, we’ll be making incremental 
improvements throughout the season.”
     UCSD is 2-2 in 2012, beating Brandon 
College in an exhibition match 3-1 before 
splitting games with the University of 
Hawaii. Playing at the University of 
Hawaii campus, UCSD lost the first match 
in straight sets, but rebounded on the 
following day to win 3-0.
     Ring’s young squad seems to be stepping 
up to the learning curve. In their 0-3 loss to 
Hawaii, the Tritons recorded a .000 hitting 
percentage on 26 kills and 26 errors. 
     The next day, UCSD rallied to upset No. 
11 Hawaii in a game that was broadcast on 
Fox College Sports Pacific.

     UCSD Men’s and Women’s Fencing took to Colorado 
Springs, Colo. on Sunday, Jan. 8 and Monday, Jan. 9 for 
their first meet of 2012, the NCAA West Invitational 
hosted by Air Force Academy.
     The women’s team placed third overall, although 
the Tritons got good results from Division I competi-
tion, first and second place finishers Northwestern and 
Stanford. The women defeated Cal Tech 26–1, Air Force 
16–11, the University of Florida 14–13 and Swarthmore 
College 24–3.
     The women’s team was carried by junior Lexy Stanley 
and sophomore Munira Gesner, who finished with sabre 
records of 13–4 and 12–4 respectively. Sophomore Amrit 
Khalsa led the Tritons in foil with a score of 10–5, and 
senior Casey Gilcrist took epee, going 9–5. 
     The men’s team placed fourth overall behind the 
University of Notre Dame, Air Force and Stanford, who 
placed first, second and third respectively. The Tritons 
had winning records against Cal Tech 25–2, Florida 20–7 
and Swarthmore 23–4. 
     Junior Joseph Schenkel had an impressive showing in 
foil, posting a score of 12–3 and sophomore Luc Ginestet 
went 12–6 in epee. Other strong showings were posted 
by freshman Adam Campbell-Kruger with a 12–6 in epee 
and sophomores Bryan Abilay (10–8) and Nick Bartuzik 
(9–6) made impressive showings in sabre. 
    Both fencing teams will compete this weekend, Jan. 13 
to Jan. 16 at the Division I Junior NAC competition in 
Portland, Ore.

    Graduation’s just as daunting for UCSD 
athletes as it is for any other undergraduate. 
Like any other postgrad, most find what work 
they can or head to graduate school. But for 
some, the end of college does not mean the 
end of their sports careers. This goes without 
question at schools like UCLA, Oregon and 
USC, whose top-round draft picks in the NFL 

and NBA make headline news in much bigger 
newspapers than our humble Guardian. It 
may seem a surprise then, that even UCSD — 
a Division II school — has its share of world-
class athletes on the rise.  
    Christine Merrill is a name that headlined 
many an article in this publication. Merrill 
is the school record holder and 2009 NCAA 
Division II national champion in the 400 
hurdles. Following her success in La Jolla, 
Merrill continued to train at the Chula Vista
