Hundreds of 
Students Walk 
In San Diego's 
MLK Day Parade 
Preparation cost $5,000 and 
took three months 
By BRENDA XU 
Contributing News Writer 

Saturday marked the 14th year of UCSD's 
participation in the Martin Luther King Jr. 
parade. 

. The 22nd annual MLK parade was held 
from 11 a.m. until noon along Harbor Drive, 
ending on Pacific Highway in San Diego. 

An estimated 250 members of the UCSD 
community, including family members of stu-
dents- and faculty, marched in the procession, 
making this the largest group UCSD has ever 
had in the parade. Clad in UCSD shirts with 
the slogan "Freedom Through Education" 
emblazoned on the back, students and faculty 
marched for one mile holding banners repre-
senting each college. 

Members from the UCSD Medical Center, 
the Preuss School and the Early Academic 
Outreach Program marched along wilh 
Chancellor Robert Dynes, Revelle Provos: 
Thomas Bond, and Marshall Provost Cecil 
Lytle in the parade. 

Nikki Cayanan, Chairwoman of the MLK 
Jr. Campus Parade Committee, was pleased at . 
the turnout of the event. 

"It just totally blew us away," Cayanan said. 
"This is the biggest contingent that UCSD has 
ever had. It was huge. We've never had this 
many people." 

According to Cayanan, preparations for the 
event took about three months and cost about 
$5,000. Funds were allocated from various 
sources on campus such as the chancellor, the 
dean and the A.S. Council, in addition. to pri-
vate contributions such as those from the 
Princeton Review. 

A portion of the funds went 10 advertising 
for the parade. Posters and banners promoted 
the parade starting a week before the celebra-
tion . Free tran.sportation to the parade and a 
continental breakfast were provided for stu-
dents and faculty. 

There were also two contests held, one for 
the most participants out of the five colleges,

Suitcase Dance Sends Students Packing 
Annual dance at Muir college awards trip for two to Florida, free meals and other prizes 
By PAIIIICK LII 
News Writer 

Muir first-year students gath-
ered at Sierra Summit Friday 
night to take part in the Muir 
College Council's annual Suitcase 
Dance. 

The doors opened at 8 p.m., 
and Muir first years streamed in, 
lugging suitcases packed for a trip 
to an unknown destination. The 
students checked their suitcases 
as they arrived. The MeC 
announced that at some point 
during the dance, a drawing 
woula be held to determine who 

would win the trip for two to the 
secret location . 

Some students speculated 
about the destination . 

"I think it's Ph illy," said Nigel 
Delaney, a first-year student. 
"They told us it would be cold and 
to bring a snowboard, but that it 
wasn't in California: 

Delaney's prediction proved 
incorrect after the drawing, 
which was held shortly before 9 
p.m. 

Master of Ceremonies Colin 
Parent announced that a limou-
sine was waiting outside to take 
the lucky freshmen to the airport. 

Fortune shined on Kristyn Molle 
that night, as her name wa's 
drawn , awarding her an all-
expense-paid weekend for two to 
the Hampton Inn in Orlando, free 
Disney World passes, and $200 in 
spending cash. 

Nearly speechless, all she could 
say was, "I didn't know: 

"There was enough demand to 
bring [the dance] back and we gave 
them lots of clues to keep them 
interested,· said MCC Chair 
Cristina Villegas. 

According to Villegas, the 
event was entirely Muir-spon-
sored. 

"We wanted it to b a commu-
nity-building activity put on by 
our community," Villegas said. 
"Even the dean chipped in." 

MCC Public Relations 
Representative Matt Bechtel 
served as DJ for the evening. 

Although many left after the 
announceme nt of the winner, 
others stayed to enjoy the music 
and await the other prizes the 
MCC had in store. Throughout 
the night, the MCC gave away gift 
certificates for free meals at 
Islands and In-N-Out and gift 
certificates for merchandise at 
Ralphs and Cost Plus.

by Revelle with 25, Muir with 24, 
Warren with 20 and Rooscvelt with 
15. The Pep Band won the second 
contest with 13 members in thc 
parade, followed by thc Alpha Kappa 
Thcta fraternity with 10 members. 

Thc Marshall College Council felt 
the cvent was significant enough to 
make it mandatory for all council 
members to attend. 

" I think it's important that our col-
lege and community show that we 
still remembcr Martin Luther King, 
not only this day but [a lso that[ the 
things that he did sti ll have effecl on

Council Michelle Law. 

Other Council members agreed 
and wanted to celebra te diversity, 
which is a main focus of Marshall co l-
lege. 

"It's just a time to celebrate how 
far our country has come in terms of 
diversity and apprecia ting other cul-
tures; said Chair of the Marshall 
Counci l Emiko Burchill. 

The lively atmosphere of the 
parade is another reason for some to 
participate. 

" I really like the energy here," sa id 
Jill Donofrio, a member of Leaders of 
the 21 st Century at Revelle. 
"Everyone's happy and cheerful and 
excited. It makes you want to be the 
same way: 

Other participants who were alive 
to witness King's effortS wanted to 
support the memory of his struggle. 

" I grew up in the 60's, so I remem-
ber vividly the freedom marches," 
Dynes said. " I remember Mart in 
Luther King and what he did." 

For some faculty members, march-
ing in the parade is an annual tradi-
tion . 

"I 've marched in this parade every 
year," Bond said. "I think it's a lot of 
fun. It's a chance for UCSD to see 
San Diego and for San Diego to see 
UCSD. It was a beautiful day and 
Martin Luther King is one of my 
heroes." 

For others, the parade was also a 
chance to spend time with their fam-
ilies and feel a sense of unity in the 
community. 

" I've been with the university for 
13 years and I think I've only missed 
twO parades," said Yvonne Reid-
Hairston, who works in thc chancel-
lor's office. "It's like an annual tradi-

BRIEFLY 
GOV. Davis' Budget to Help UC System 

Gov. Gray Davis announced his proposed 
2001-2002 budget last week, which would give 
the University of California a financial boost. 

Under the proposed budget, the annual state 
allowance for the university would increase 6.3 
percent to $3.4 billion allowing for the admis-
sion of an additional 5,700 students to be fund-
ed . The budget would also help maintain afford-
able tuition for students and their families, 
increased employee salaries, and aid in the pro-
liferation of the university 's teaching, research 
and public programs to maintain their increasing 
excellence. 

The budget const itutes the second wave of 
provisions made to create the California 
Inst itutes for Sc ience and Innovation, one of 
whic h, the Inst itute fo r Internet and 
Telecommunications Technology, will be built at 
UCSD in partnership with UC Irvine. 

In addition to these improvements, the bud· 
'get will also allocate more support for UC grad-
uate programs, summer instruction on certain 
campuses and greater student retention pro-
grams. 

Prior to the creation, Davis had made it clear 
that a strong partnership between his adminis-
trat ion and the university would be forged. The 
plan calls for an annual increase in financial sup-
port for the university.

Asian-Pacific Student Association, 
the African-American Student 
Union, the Cross Cultural Center 
and the Women's Club all had

The celebration featured a

World Beat. World Beat leaders 
Nana Yaw Asiedu and Brana 
Matejic arrived with their percus-
sion instruments. The instruments 
were placed around the ci rcle of 
chairs.

from Chancellor Robert Dynes.

praise or one of spite, it is one that is synony-
11I0US with resiliency, compassion and ability. 

When Clinton belts 
out an intention , whether 
it is." I'm going to run for 
Senate," or ''I'm going 
out for a run: she leaves 
the president , fellow 
Democrats and opposing 
Republicans alike shiver-
ing in their Bruno Magli 
loafers, nervous to their 
wits' ends in anticipation 
of the explosion of ideas that usually result 
from her actions. 

Sure, the Climon we all know is the Clin-
ton who wanted to serve as her husband's 
attorney general. the Clinton whose health 
care initia tive failed, the Clinton whose hair-
do never seems to quite fit and, finally, the 
Clinton whose sole purpose as first lady is to 
be a leech on the neck of her husband in 
hopes of funhering her own political ambi-
tions. All this is wrong. Beneath her exterior, 
there is a kinder, gentler Clinton. 

It seems that all we can think about is 
Clinton'S fai led programs, broken marriage 

and rocky road to Capitol Hill. 
What stays hidden is the interior of a 

woman who transformed the traditional 
role. of first lady. For the first time since 
Eleanor Roosevelt, the first lady did not 
exist mainly to enhance her husband's 
political career; she had an agenda of her 
own. Clinton is the first first lady to have 
her own office in the West Wing. 

From her days with the Rose Law Finn 
in Arkansas to her days at the White House, 
Clinton has always been a part of vital legis-
lation: Her drive for educational reform has 
been one of her biggest works in progress 
and has made a world of difference in 

school districts across the 
country. 

She has played vital 
roles in improving access 
to child care, moderniz-
ing adoption processes, 
fighting for international 
human rights, attending 
to Gulf War Syndrome 
and raising awareness of 
breast and cervical can-

cers, Just to name a few. Above all this, she 
has managed to remind America that our 
children are not "rugged individualists" and 
that "it takes a village to raise a child." 

Clinton helped establish the Violence 
Against Women Act and, from her new 
position in the Senate, she hopes to do 
wonders for New York's taxes, environment 
and education. 

I t is a mystery to me how critics can base 
their opinions about such a hard-working 
woman on scandals and events beYond her

MTV Offers a Rare 
Chance to Enlighten 

No 
Angel 

ANGELA CARRIER 
As I wandered around my 

apartment Wednesday night, I 
was stopped suddenly, distracted 
by the program that my room-
mates were watching on televi-
sion. The!rogram had mediocre 
acting an I, at first, thought it 
was one of those silly drama 
series, but I was instantly 
intrigued and cou ldn 't pull 
myself away from the screen. 

There were no commercial 
breaks and I wondered what sta-
tion was airing the show. To my 
surprise, jt was MTV. It was the 
special showing of "A Hate Crime 
Revealed: the story of Matthew 
Shepard. 

I recalled hearing about the 
horrific crime that took place in 
Wyoming and had read an article 
about it in "Time." Though it cer-
tainly was not the first crime of 
such nature and magnitude, the 
case of Matthew Shepard drew 
national attention. 

The harsh treatment of gays 
in America, the "land of the free: 
needed to be brought to light. 
The events surrounding Shep-
ard 's death were unsettling. With 
its portrayal of the violence of the 
men who attacked him and exhi-
bition of small-town anti-gay 
sentiment, the program struck 
emotional chords. 

But the IUOSt disturbing pan 
of the story was the public reac-
tion after Shepard's death. There 
was footage of actual events and 
protests that transpired after his 
death woven into the movie. The 
posters that people made in 
response to Shepard's death were 
appalling. Bold letters on posters 
screamed "Matt is in Hell." 

To know that the people who 
made these posters were so-
called people of the church was 
especially disturbing. Those peo-
ple who claimed to be followers 
of God were certainly not practic-
ing the unconditional love they 
believed was so graciously given 
to them. There can be no resolu-
tion when those who should ease 
the problem only contribute to it. 

I am not saying all believers 
are of the same outspoken and 
judgmental type, but those out-
spoken people are the ones who 
set precedence into the public's 
eye of what all Christians are like. 
It is outrageously hypocritical to 
judge another person without 
considering one's own faults. 

My initial reaction to the show 
was to praise MTV for sparing an 
hour of airtime from the bom-
bardment of advertisements. A 
significant statement was 
made: This is an important topic 
that warrants no interruption. 

The popularity of MTV with 
youth adds to the impact. Eager 
young viewers flip to their 
favorite music channel to find 
something very different. MTV

Year of the Dragon in Review 
Asian-Americans faced many highs and lows in 2000 
I, TOM vu 
Opinion Editor 

After more than a month of 
earnest waiting, I was finally able 
to watch "Crouching Tiger, Hid-
den Dragon" this weekend . I had 
high expectations for the movie, 
and director Ang Lee more than 
lived up to them. The movie 
boasts outstanding directing, 
beautiful cinematography (the 
best I've seen since "Brave heart"), 
lively plot, frantic action, humor 
and tragedy all rolled into one. A 
great modern movie based on 
classic Chinese martial arts films, 
complete with flying and sword 
fights, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden 
Dragon" was simply one of the 
best movies this writer has ever 
seen. 

The release of "Crouching 
Tiger, Hidden Dragon" near the 
end of 2000 capped a roller-coast-
er year for Asian-Americans. Like 
the movie, there were many uplift-
ing moments as well as many 
tragic ones for Asian-Americans 
in 2000. The perceived break-
through of Lucy Liu, the uncon-
stitutional treatment of Wen Ho 
Lee, the ascent of Asians in Amer-
ican politics, and the godforsaken 
"Mr. Wong" are only some of the 
conflicting highs and lows Asian 
Americans experienced last year. 

With Chinese New Year arriv-
ing soon to welcome the Year of 
the Snake, it seems only justified 
to glance back at the Year of the 
Dragon and shed some much 
needed light on the Asian Ameri-
can experiences in it. Perhaps this 
article will open people's eyes, 
brown ones, green ones, blue ones 
or whatever, to themselves and to 

others. As the ancient Chinese 
ph ilosopher Lao Tzu said, "He 
who knows others is learned, but 
he who knows himself is wise." 

Asia n-Americans took great 
steps forward in the Year of the 
Dragon, particularly in politics 
and on the silver screen. Asians 
arc generally 5tereotyped as ind is-
creet, "model minorities." taking 
whatever hits and punches they 
receive quietly so as not to ca use 
commotion. The year 2000 
undoubtedly proved this stereo-

With Chinese New 
Year arriving soon to 
welcome the Year of the 
Snake, it seems only 
justified to glance back 
at the Year of the 
Dragon and to shed 
some much needed light 
on the Asian-American 
experiences in it. 
type wrong as Asian men and 
women stormed the political 
front. 

Perhaps the most prominent 
example of this political uprising, 
if you will, is President Clinton's 
selection of Norman Mineta as 
Commerce Secretary. A former 
mayor of San Jose and member of 

. the House of Representatives for 
20 years, Mineta became the first 
Asian-American cabinet member 
in U.S. history in 2000. Even 
though he was imprisoned in an 
internment camp during the sec-

ond World War, he does not look 
back on his life with blll crness, 
but rather with a voice of opti-
mism. This IS a testament to his 
character (much bener than that 
of his boss) and his abi lity to reach 
across the aisle. In fac t, President-
elect Bush actually appointed 
Mincta to be Transportation 
Secratary in his cabinet. Mincta is 
now a force to be reckoned with 
in Washington. 

"a Magazine." a magazi ne on 
Asian-American lifestyle, recently 
conducted a survey on wh ich 
Asian-Americans had the bright-
est political future. Names includ-
ed in the poll were Mineta, Mike 
Honda and Gary Locke. In th is 
past election cycle, Honda, a fo r-
mer assemblyman, ran against Jim 
Cunneen for a congressional scat 
and barely lost. Locke won his re-
election bid for governor of Wash-
ington state and is already touted 
as a possible future vice-presiden-
tial nominee. 

Other Asian-Americans 
receiving sub.stantial vo tes were 
S.B. Woo, a former Delaware lieu-
tenant governor and fo under of 
th e 80-20 Initiative, Christine 
Chen, director of programs for the 
Organization for Chinese-Ameri-
cans, and Ted Fang, the fi rst 
Asian-American owner of a major 
newspaper, The San Francisco 
Examiner: 

Another art:a where Asian-
Americans made significant 
strides in 2000 was the entertain-
ment business. The Yea r of the 
Dragon was when Liu became 
one of Charlie's angels and her 
name became a household one.

control. For instance, because of 
thr Whit~water scandal. Clinton 
is seen as dishonest, self-centered 
and controlling. But if asked 
today, most Americans would not 
even remember what the scandal 
was ca lled or what it was about. 

What about the Lewinsky 
incident, you ask? Do you know 
anyone e.lse who would forgive 
her husband for cheating on her, 
prompting every journalist in the 
country to vie for her "feelings" 
on the affai r? For that, she 
should receive the Woman of the 
Century Award. 

It scems that Clinton is a 
strong, ou tspoken and deter-
mined woman who lacks the 
fincsse and demurc qualities that 
we have come to expect from a 
first lady. Many men and Republi-
cans are th reatened by her atti -
tude and actions. 

Her cutthroat political abi lity 
and rhetoric leave many to con-
clude that she is controll ing, powcr 
hungry and difficult. That's a new 
one. Politicians who are control-
ling, power hungry and difficult? 
Pkase, give the woman a brcak. 

When you ask Clinton-l1aters 
why they despise her, you will get

many different answers. Some will 
say that her policies and ideas 
have failed . Some will respond 
with simplistic adjectives, saying 
she is cold, mea n, bossy or selfish. 
Some will just say that she is a 
bitch and that they have no other 
justification. 

Even if some of her ideas have 
failed, why should she be consid-
ered useless? How can a woman 
who fights fo r human and 
women's rights worldwidc be seen 
as cold? Does Hillary's use of her 

positiol~ to voice her ideas qualify 
her as a bitch? If all these qualities 
were pinned on someone else 
other than the first lady, would 
there be such an explosion of crit-
icism? Probably not. 

Clinton has graced the covers 
of nearly a dozen magazines, been 
at the top of many Most Valuable 
Politician and Most Influcntial 
Women lists and has assisted in 
many successful dcmocratic cam-
paign victories. 

Clinton is a team player, a dili-
gcnt and compassionatc worker, a 
woman of substance, and a person 
who has always commanded a lot 
of rcspect and attention. Though 
these attributes have made her one 
of thc most loathed women in pol-
itics, they are the very things that 
will make her great.

comings. Where else can we find a 
woman who has supported and 
defended a husband who has 
strayed more than once, endured 
eight years of media criticism, 
worked on countless legislation 
reforms, and simultaneously been 
a mother and run for senator, 
winning with a smile? 

Coming to the Senate in the 
107th Congress, Clinton will be in 
the company of 12 other women 
who will surely change Capitol 
Hill as we know it. 

Clinton, as one of the most 
vocal senators in Congress, will 
definitely give attention to legisla-
tion that would otherwise not 
have been acknowledged. 

She is familiar with struggle, 
controversy and hard - some-
times futile - work. Clinton will 
be one of the grandest additions 
to govcrnment simply because of 
her resilient character. Although 
she will be reminded that she is 
not a popular figure, and many 
will argue about her ability to per-
form , one thing is certain: When 
the next first lady or fema le sena-
tor or the first woman president 
storms D.C., she will have Clinton 
to thank for paving the way. 

Whatever your opinions on 
this lady may be, it is advisable to 
see beyond her rough demeanor 
and image and actually look at 
what she represents. You may dis-
cover she is not so bad after all. 
You may even like her. 

least try to gain a new undcr-
standing. One does not have to 
believe in or accept an idea, but an 
attempt should at least be made to 
understand it. 

It is encouraging to see pro-
grams that touch on important 
events and problems that affect 
our nation . By educati ng the peo-
ple, especially the younger gener-
ation, there is hope for less hate in 
the future. 

Con: 
Clinton is all too willing 
to lie and cheat to win 
contIIwed fronI ... 4 
their jobs. 

Fudging results 'and not firing 
poor teachers to keep influential 
special interest groups happy is 
hardly a sign of Clinton looking 
out for the best interests of our 
children. Here we have proof that 
Clinton's personal and political 
agendas greatly outweigh the issues 
facing the people whom she claims 
her policies will help. 

Aside from being a miserable 
policy maker, on questions of char-
acter or integrity, Clinton's record 
is clear: The truth is something to 
be manipulated, changed and cov-
ered up. In her debate with Rick 
Lazio, Clinton was forced to listen 
to her own lie on the "Today 
Show' concerning her husband's 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky 
when the scandal first went public. 

Hillary listened to herself assure 
the country that the allegations 
against her husband were not true 
and that the entire scandal was a 
'"vast, right-wing conspiracy." 
Upon hearing her own words, 
Hillary stood at the podium, looked 
straight into the cameras and kept 
on lying. She refused to admit a 
mistake, apologize for a blatant lie 
to the American public or acknowl-
edge the truth in any way. There 
was no remorse for her deception 
and she made it clear that, for her, 
pCljury is purely instinctual. 

Finally, on a philosophical level, 
Clinton is plain scary. Therc is a 
philosophy known as "The Third 
Way; which is a political term with 
a storied history among the most 
catastrophic political movements 
of the 20th century. The Third Way 
is essentially a political ideology 
combining fascism and capitalism 
into 'a neofacist structure, which 

Tuesday, January 16, 2001 

embodies state control and lack of 
individual liberties combined with 
the poweJiul elite class of capital-
ism. President Hillary, an elite at 
the head of government, would 
control everything. 

The Nazis used the Third Way 
to describe their system of national 
socialism as some point on the 
social expanse equidistant from 
communism in the Soviet Union 
and capitalism I the West. Trot-
skyists use the term to differentiate 
their own form of Marxism from 
Stalinism. Clint n has described 
her own political philosophy as the 
politics of the Third Way. This 
places her among fellow megalo-
maniacs in the realtp of political 
ideology as well as that of dictator-
ial aspirations. 

Clirtton is not a good person. 
She is not honest. She is a racist 
and an anti-Semite and has at no 
time in her career accomplished 
anything on her own merit. She 
will cut every corner and will break 
every rule to get what she wants. 
She seeks to serve one person -
herself. 

In four years we will be looking 
at an economy which will likely be 
in a worse state than it is now, as 
turbulent affairs continue through-
out the developing world and 
countless other unpredictable 
political, social and economic 
issues crop up. There will be a 
temptation to look to Clinton and a 
new agenda for Ameri~, which will 
simply be a cover for the Third Way. 

Do not be foo led: Remember 
this: If Clinton and her fellow 
enlightened prophets of the future 
do indeed posses privileged knowl-
edge on how to fix America's woes, 
they will not ' tell you. As their 
leader, Clinton will lie, for as soon 
as the public becomes privy to her 
enigmatic solution, it will no longer 
be a secret. Her envisioned future 
will become reali ty, and her self-
righteous role as humanity'S van-
guard will cease to exist.

New Year: 
}ear of the Dragoo forced 
Asians to face reality 
continued fronI .... 
M. Night Shyamalan directed the 
wildly popular "Sixth Sense" and 
the equally dark "Unbreakable." 
Angela Perez B~raquio was 
crowned Miss America, the first 
Asian ever. Rita g was likewise the 
first Asian Miss California. 

Movies such as "Romeo Must 
Die" and "Crouching Tiger, Hid-
den Dragon" thrust Asians into a 
stro'ng leading roles. Yes, this writer 
is aware that neither jet Li nor 
Chow Yun Fat are Asian-Ameri-
cans, but to place Asians into lead 
roles in action )llovies in a culture 
that all too often suppresses such 
roles for Asian men is, to me, quite 
a revolution. More important. 
though, is the popularity of the 
films across ethnici ties. lt was well 
received by most , with Ang Lee's 
movie gaining critical acclaim. 

And then there is Coco Lee. In 
the immortal words of comic book 
kgend Stan Lee (no, he's not 
Asian) , ·'Nuff said, truc believer." 

Of course, not evel)'thing came 
- e,lsily for Asian-Americans in 

2000. With the great stride for-
ward, thae is the juxtaposed step 
backward. In a new decade, in a 
new century, and new millennium, 
everyone - whites, blacks, Latin-
Americans, Asian-Americans -
would like to think that racism is a 
thing of the past decade, century 
and millennium. This, however, is 
as distant from reality as Taiwan is 
from mainland China on Tai-
wanese independence. The Year of 
the Dragon is a prime example of 
thi s. 

The most distllrbing case of 
racism is the persecution of Wen 
Ho Lee by the federal government. 
With ridiculous accusations of spy-
ing and espionage and even threats 
of execution, the federal govern-
ment picked Lee's life apart. After 
imprisoning Lee in solitary con-
finement for nine months, the fed-
eral prosecutors did an about-face 
and released him after he signed a 
plea-bargain stating that he was 
guilty of some minor misde-
meanor. Only days before, Attorney 
General janet Reno had called Lee 
a threat to national security. 

Of all the other physicists at Los 
. Alamos ational Laborato ri es; 
only Lee was si ngled out and pros-
ecuted in such unconstitutional 
ways. The reason: He's Asian and 
had the most reason to spy for 
China. The ridicu lous part: Lec is 
not from mainland China; he is 
Taiwanese. If you're Asian, or at 
leas t Taiwanese, you know this 
makes all the difference in the 
world . Prcsident Climon and the 
U.S. district judge that handled the 
casc harshly criticized thc fedcral 
prosecutors for thei r conduct and 
treatment of Lee. 

But it was too late for apologies. 
The Lee case opened a rather large 
can of worms. It was apparent that 
anti-Chinese sentiment was still 
prevalent and brought up memo-
ries of japanese internment during 
World War II. As "a Magazine" 
writes, "The question had never 
been whether Lee was guilty or 
innocent. The issue was that he 
had bcen a victim of the American 
justice system and a scapegoat for 
federal prosecutors blinded by 
xenophobia and anti-China hyste-
ria ." 

The most blatantly offensive -
and annoying - affront to Asian-
Americans of the year must be the 
"Mr. Wong" online cartoon. Por-
trayed with every offensive stereo-
type one could place on an Asian 
- yellow-skinned, bucktoothed, 
slanted eyes and submissive, Mr. 
Wong spcnds his time trying to 
seduce white women. It doesn't 
take a Dimensions of Culture stu-
dent to sce where this is going. It is 
hard [0 find the words to describe 
the ridicu lousness of "Mr. Wong;

Asian men as a new form of

Editor: 
Throughout the course of the 

year [ have read many articles 
about the lack of school spirit at 
UCSD. From recent articles about 
the poor amount of support for 
school teams, to others about the 
lack of student involvement and 
organization, the student body 
has been accused of basically not 
caring. Well; I would like to 
address this claim by issuing a 
claim of my own: The perpetrator 

of this crime is UCSD itself. 
Take a look around the cam-

pus and discover the truth: The 
student body is separated into 
groups in order to keep it from 
organizing. A look into the his-
tory of the UC system will reveal 
a ploy to keep the student body 
from coming together. 

When the land was originally 
bought from the government at 
the time of the founding of this 
campus, the other two UC cam-
puses, Los Angeles and Berkeley, 

had just gone through a major 
period of student organization-
led protest movements. Thus 
came the development of the col-
lege system at UCSD, a way to 
keep student protests and organi-
zation to a minimum. 

Students are separated so as 
to minimize protest and keep the 
students from organizing (I 
mean, come on, how many of us 
have actually been to ERC?). 
Notice the blandness of the 
buildings, especially at Muir, 
where they look so similar. This 
form of control is also evident in 
the Price Center, with certain 
strategic entrances that can be 
easily blocked off in the event of 
student protest, and which is 
cleverly positioned right next to 
the police station. Walk around 
campus and try to find places to 
sit down with some of your 
friends; benches are few and far 
between, as the only time people 
are really willing to sit on the 
cement in the Price Center and 
listen is when Brother Jed is con-
demning us all to the fires of 
hell. 

While the people in charge will 
push all the benefits of the college 
system, like a small-college feel at 
a big university, they fail to men-
tion the lack of all-campus 
involvement that the system cre-
ates. People do not get up for the 
basketball games. painting their 
faces and filling the stands, 
because they are not unified. 
Events such as the Un-Olympics 
can draw the whole school 
together because they bring the 
colleges together, but to say that 
we are unified under UCSD is 
quite difficult when we all feel so 
separated from those who are not 
at the same college. 

As the creation and develop-
ment of Sixth College begins, I 
ask people to take a moment and 
reflect on the system that has 
developed over the years. The col-
leges have their advantages, the 
closeness they create, the individ-
ual attention. But expectins an 
entire university, already diVided, 
to come together ~nd cheer as 
one at a Division II sporting 
event, is a lot to expect. 

Take my words any way you 
want: as the rantings of a mad 
man who, perhaps, has had too 
much time to think since the end 
of finals, or words that implicate a 
system set up to divide people in 
order to weaken student organi-
zation. 

The choice is ours in the end 
- we can fall victim to the sepa-
ration, or we can rise above it and 
unite, taking pride not only in our 
colleges, but in our university as a 
whole, together as Tritons.

Bush's Choice of Attorney General 
Reignites Post-Election Battle 

WASHINGTON - The con-
firmation hearings for John D. 
Ashcroft, who has been chosen to 
be the next attorney general, will 
be the stage for what has become 
the first major political battle of 

_the new Bush administration. 
Ashcroft, a formet:. Missouri 

senator, governor and attorney 
general. appears before the Senate 
Judiciary Committee on Tuesday 
afternoon. 

Because he brings a long 
record as a staunch conservative 
on school desegregation, affirma-
tive action, abortion, gay rights 
and otho:r emotion-laden issues, 

- the- hearings may serve as the 
opening skirmish in an ideological 

- war that is likely to continue over 
the next few years. 

"It is the salient political event 
of tht: Bush presidency so far: 
said Thomas Mann, a political sci-
entist and authority on Congress 
at the Brookings Institution in 
Washington . "It tells us a lot about 
the new president and tells us 
about the response of the 
Democratic Party. It gives us some 
hints of the dynamics that might 

Liberal interest group 
have vowed to make it 
difficult for Democrats to 
support the nominatUm. 

unfold over the next few years as 
these forces battle and confront 
each other." 

To counter any notion of racial 
insensitivity on Ashcroft's part, 
Republicans handling the confirma-
tion campaign have lined up sup-
port from blacks. Monday, the cam-
paign released a letter of support 
from Charles Evers of Mississippi, 
the brother of Medgar Evers. the 
slain civil rights leader. And Charles 
Polk, a black lawyer from St. Louis. 
who will be Ashcroft's chief assistant 
in t11e hearings, spoke to reporters 
Monday. 

"I've known Senator Ashcroft 
for 15 years, and the man is as 
solid as can be: Polk said. Any 
notion that Ashcroft is unsympa-
thetic to black causes, he said, "is 
a joke. I don't believe it for one 
minute." 

Liberal interest groups have 
vowed to make it difficult for 
Democrats to support the ' nomi-
nation. And The American Civil 
Liberties Union in a report issued 
Monday entitled "Not Moderate, 
Not Compassionate, Not 
Conservative," portrayed Ashcroft 
as an extremist. 

"Taken as a whole: the group 
said, Ashcroft's policy positions 
over the years "reflect a funda-
mental opposition to long-
standing interpretations of core 
constitutional principles: from 
separation of church and state to 
equal protection under the law. 

But GOP leaders in the Senate 
have stated that a\l 50 Republicans 
will vote to confirm Ashcroft and 
they have said they expect some 
Democrats to join them. 
Ashcroft's opponents have asked 
Democrats not to be too quick to 
announce their support, in the 
hope that the situation will 
become increasingly fluid as the 
hearings continue.

Better Schools Honor King, Bush Says 
HOUSTON - In an effort to reach , out to 

blacks, President-elect George W. Bush told an 
audience at a mostly black elementary school here 
Monday that he would honor the Rev. Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr.'s legacy by working to improve 
public schools and to give all Americans a shot at 
success. 

"The dream of eq uality is empty without excel-
lent schools," Bush said as he marked the King 
birthday holiday with a brief visit to Kelso 
Elementary School, in a poor, black area of this 
ci~ . 

"That goal will take presidential leadership and 
leadership from our new secretary of education. It 
is a goal we set. It is a goa l we would work endless-
ly to ach ieve." 

The man whom Bush has chosen to be his edu-
cation secretary, Roderick R. Paige, who is black, 
stood beside him. Paige, who attended segregated 
schools in Miss issippi, vouched for Bush as a 
leader of outstanding character. 

"His presence here today signals he understands 
the importance of this day to you, and to me, and 
to all of us in the nation," Paige said . 

Bush said he had chosen Paige to be education 
secretary in part because "he shares the ideals of 
Martin Luther King: equal opportunity, equal 
treatment and equal rights." 

Bush 's appearance here Monday seemed a tacit 
recognitior. of his poor showing among blacks in 
the presidential election . Bush won only 8 percent 
of the black vote, despite a campaign schedule 
often heavy on visits to minority neighborhopds 
and events that surrounded Bush with blacks and 
Hispanics. 

During the recount of votes in Florida , some 

black leaders argued that black voters had been 
disenfranchised, and some subsequent opinion 
polls suggested that blacks remained deeply skepti-
cal of the extent of Bush's concern for them. 

Bush's remarks here came a day before the 
scheduled start of confirmation hearings for his 
proposed attorney general, John Ashcroft, the for-
mer senator of Missouri, whose record on racial 
issues is expected to come under intense scrutiny.

The same thing has happened 
often during California's energy 
crisis. The alerts mean that 
California's energy surplus has 
grown so thin that energy compa-
nies are looking to buy additional 
supplies to meet demand. 

But the calls served as the latest 
reminder that energy problems in 
one state can affect many other 

state~, owing to the interconnect-
edness of America's energy grid. 
California uses one-third of all 
the energy produced in the West. 
But the same steep price increases 
are occurring nationwide because 
the electricity all flows through the 
same regional grids. 

The flow of power produced in 
the western third of the country is 
controlled by 31 centers like the one 
here. The center manages the flow 
of electricity generated by 50 power 
plants. The energy is pumped into

Although other parts of the 
country were also affected by land-
slides, this neighborhood about six 
miles west of the city was clearly 
the worst hit. Rescue officials esti-
mated that more than 400 people 
were killed nationwide - more 
than 150 of them here. They said 
about a thou-

by utility companies according to 
schedules of estimated need that the 
companies submit to energy bro-
kers by the hour. 

For the workers at the center, 
the trick is to match the need with 
the supply, which is done through 
computerized adjustments. But as 
demand for energy is growing so 
are problems. 

"We're seeing outages that we've 
never seen before: said Joel Bladow, 
manager of the center here. "With 
changes in the market the way ener-
gy is bought and sold, more and 
more we're seeing bulk transactions 
of energy over longer distances, like 
California buying energy from 
Wyoming. We had one instance 
recently where a plant in Utah 
tripped off-line, overloading a line 
between Utah and Colorado that 
was rated to carry 680 megawatts. All 
of a sudden, it was over 800, so we 
had to take quick action. 

"If we hadn't: he added, "anoth-

In China, Your Phone Number Makes a Personal Statement 
SHANG HAI , China - The 

vendors exhibit their wares proud-
ly, separating them into a spectrum 
of premium, regular and discount. 
Signs highlighting the "specials of 
the day" entice shoppers looking 
fo r a cherished commodity in 
today 's China: lucky cell phone 
numbt'rs. 

For Chinese executives, home-
makers and students, prestige wi th 
a mobile phone is less about 

okia, Ericsson or Motorola than 
about 6, 8 and 9. Across the coun-
try, stores have window displays 
with their best numbers. 'A 9 in the 
number might signal longevity, 
wherc<1s 168 might bring "a road of 

prosperity." 
In large cities, auctions lure 

hundreds of buyers with special 
numbers set a~idc by mobile phone 
companies. One number fetched 
nearly $40,000 at a charity auction 
in August in Zhengzhou, Henan 
Province. 

"The best are 8s: said Zhang 
Haosheng, a telephone number 
vendor in Shanghai. "Four or five 
8s at the end is very prestigious; 6s 
and 9s are good too, but one 6 or 9 
is nothing special. You need at least 
two in a row." 

Certain sequences are highly 
sought because they sound like 
Chinese phrases in different 

dialects. In Mandarin, the popular 
sequence 518 can be interpreted as, 
"I want to prosper: and 168 
sounds like, "A road of prosperity." 
In Cantonese, the sequence 289 
sounds like, "Easy long- term 
prosperity." 

In China, phone numbers are 
generally preassigned to cards pur-
chased separately from the phones 
themselves. The cards, and therefore 
the number, can be transferred from 
one phone to another. 

Most are bought wholesale 
from mobile phone companies and 
then sold by independent vendors 
for a base price of about $30. But it 
is not unusual for desirable num-

bers to double, triple or quadruple 
the price. 

The most highly appraised 
numbers stem from Chinese 
numerology, a cultural relationship 
not unlike the West's partiality 
toward 7 and aversion to 13. 

The number 8, pronounced 
"ba" in Mandarin, is considered 
desirable because it rhymes with 
the word for prosper, "fa." In 
Mandarin, the number 9 is pro-
nounced identically to the word for 
long-lasting, "ji u." Thus Sept. 9, 
1999, was a particularly popular 
day for Chinese weddings. 

The number 6 is popular for a 
variety of reasons. Depending on 

the dialect, its interpretation ranges 
fro m "longevity" to "joy." 

In December, Li Songwei, 28. 
received a present from his father, a 
number ending in 8889988, pur-
chased for $2,500 at a charity auc-
tion. 

Since then, the number has 
given Li minor celebrity status. 
"The phone never stops ri nging: 
Li, a businessman, said. He has 
received offers to buy the number, 
invita tions to join associations, 
overtures of friendship and 
req uests for interviews.

Bill Hall, interim vice president 
of Student Affairs, said he is 
"encouraged that students have

large-scale problem." He is calling 
for a committee of students, busi-

explore the security proposal and 
other options. 

The Council of Graduate 
Students and USG have a proposal 
to allow students to hire off-duty 
police officers to help regulate off-
campus parties, using an allocation 
of the funds provided by the Coca-
Cola contract that was signed in 
July. It is estimated that it would 
cost $200 to have an off-duty offi-
cer at a party for four hours. 

The idea comeS from an effort 
to decrease the amount of tights 
and violent crimes that take place 
at off-campus parties. 

Some are looking to the Greek 
community as an example of how 
effective security can control large 
parties. Greek parties are equipped 
with a security guard, guest list and 
marking system for underage stu-
dents.

BOULDER, Colo. - If it 
weren't already difficult enough for 
students to motivate themselves to 
go to class, college-oriented dot-
com companies are giving students 
a legitimate reason to skip class: 
free online lecture notes. 

Companies such as Versity.com,

offer students online lecture notes

The precedent is being set. 
According to the Chronicle of 
Higher Education, the University 
of Florida tried unsuccessfully in 
1993 to sue a traditional note-tak-
ing service. The jury in a federal 
district court found that what is 
said by a professor in a lecture is 
typically facts or ideas which do not 
belong to anyone. 

Professors who oppose the sale 
of their lecture notes are concerned 
about what qualities as intellectual 
property. 

The online sites, however, have 
avoided lawsuits from professors 
and universities thus far by includ-
ing disclaimers on their sites. 
StudentU.com says in its dis-
claimer that "the lecture notes you 
find in StudentUcom are just a 
note-taker's interpretation of what 
was presented in the lecture. They 
are absolutely, positively not the 
professor's lecture notes. They did-

from the teacher - not from the

The Regents may adjust 
their investments 
ContInued from ...,. 10 
increase investment volatility. 

But public health organizations 
argue the tobacco stocks contradict 
California's Propositi n 99, which 
is designed to pull the reins on 
tobacco companies with higher 
tobacco product taxes. 

Coun decisions against tobacco 
companies in the last decade have 
prompted the regents to consider 
precautionary measures of ~xclltding 
the stocks from the funds and re-
adjusting other investments to com-
pensate for the loss of these stocks. 

,Philip Morris currently holds 
$78 billion in companies such as 
Miller Brewing Company and Kraft 
foods. 

Although the conglomerate has 
been involved in public works pro-
jects such as disaster relief efforts, 
AIDS-related charity and food dri-
ves for the h ltngry, such contribu-
tions to charity, while meritable, 
cannol, o!Hweigh 430,000 annual 
smoking-re lated deaths, said 
Richard Levinson, associate execu-
tive dir.:ctor of the American Public 
Healih Association . 

"Kraft Foods produces a whole-
some family image," he said. "But 
no matter what their good contr~ 
butions arc, they have a business 
that is not socially acceptable." 

While university divestments 
are unlikely to economically dam-
age tobacco companies, according 
to Levinson , the divestments may 
help build awareness among fellow 
public institutions. Levinson advis- -
es that universities conduct back-
ground checks on the companies 
in which they plan to invest. 

Harvard, Stanford and the 
Universities of Michigan, Washing-
ton and Wisconsin have already 
divested. Nonhwestern University 
has historically been tobacco-free in 
its investments. 

According to the Social Invest-
ment Forul!!, this procedure of rul-
ing out tobacco manufacturers is not 
uncommon among 84 percent of 
America's "socially responsible port-
folios." Since the replacement of 
Small, the regents have consulted 
Wilshire Associates for financial 
guidance. 

"(Divestment) would make UC 
consistent with the ethical position 
being taken by other universities: 
Brown said. "UC should not lag 
behind."

Police ConsIder 
Alcohol Crackdown at 
PrInceton Clubs 

PRINCETON, N.j. - Borough 
Police officials are considering the 
use of undercover officers apd 
aggressive investigation tactics to 
monitor and curtail underage 
drinking at eating clubs, Borough 
Police Capt. Charles Davall said. 

"What prompted us to ask some 
questiqns were the two sexual 
assaults that occurred recently: 
Davall said. "There have also been 
intoxicated kids sent to the 
[princeton Medical CenterJ, but it's 
really the assaults - and the alcohol 
involved - that got our anention." 

The plan would aim ·to prevent 
underage drinking on Prospect 
Avenue and could lead to tines and 
charges against the eating clubs, 
Davall sa id. 

"No decisions - about the 
investigations and going undercov-
er - have been made yet: Davall 
said. "We're still gathering informa-
tion." 

Borough Police officials have 
sensed a disregard for alcohol laws 
at the eating clubs, according to 
Davall. During a meeting last week 
between police and eating club 
officials, officers discussed under-
age drinking and possible police 
action, 111:: said. 

"We meet with the clubs every 
year to talk about the law and alco-
hol: Davall said, adding that the 
tone of this year's meeting was 
more erious than in the past. 
"They sti ll aren't responsible with 
serving alcohol. That's when you 
have to look at the problem anoth-
er way." 

Eating club officers discussed 
the proposed crackdown at last 
week's rcc meeting, prompting 
some clubs to consider changes to 
their alcohol distribution policies, 

ICC president Dan Winn '01 
said the clubs will be working to 
reduce underage drinking on 
Prospect. "I think the attitude the 
clubs are taking is rather than call 
their bluff, look at how we can 
work to improve the situation: he 
said. • 

Cottage Club will be providing 
additional security and safety mea-
sures in response to the possible 
Borough Police escalation, said 
Cottage president Chris Wolff '01.

Former Harvard 
Professor Enters 
Bush Administration 

CAMB RIDGE, Mass. 
Lawrence B. Lindsey has gone 
from grading Ec. 10 exams to grad-
ing the economy for the leader of 
the free world. 

When President-elect George 
W. Bush announced his intention 
to appoint former Harvard 
University assistant professor 
Lawrence B. Lindsey as assistant to 
the president for economic policy, 
it coincided with the former Texas 
governor's public declaration that 
the country should prepare for a 
potential economic slump. 

Once a section leader for Ec. 10, 
Lindsey served as a member of the 
board of governors of the Federal 
Reserve System from 1991 to 1997. 
During that time, he forewarned of 
the imminent end to the country's 
economic prosperity. Yet even prior 
to his days in the White House, 
Lindsey gained a reputation as a 
valued adviser. 

While at Harvard, Lindsey 
worked closely with Baker Professor 
of Economics Martin S. -Feldstein 
'61. Feldstein, Lindsey's mentor and 
former adviser to the Reagan 
administration, praised the career 
successes of his former colleague. 

Lauding Linpsey's work in the 
College's economics department, 
Feldstein wrote in an e-mail mes-
sage, "It was (the) perfect prepara-
tion for his current job'" 

Still, not all of his former col-
leagues expected Lindsey would 
end up in the White House. 

"He always had an interest in 
public policy (but) there are a lot of 
policy-oriented professors at Har-
vard: Professor of Economics N. 
Gregory Mankiw says. "r wouldn't 
have predicted that he would end up 
in the position he's in today." 

Acknowledging his public poli-
cy expertise, Mankiw says that it is 
Lindsey's advising approach that 
will help him most in his new job. 

"He was a very good teacher. 
Very rarely do people pull you aside 
and tell you how to teach better: 
says Mankiw. "It was nice to have 
Larry pull me aside and give me lit-
tle pointers here and there:

Professors 
understand the 
difficulties of 

being a student 

I> 0 you have your career and financia l future in mind when you register for classes? Do you feel alienated in big lectures? 
Do you feel a distance 

between your professors and yourself? 
Do you spend most of your time at 
work and have no time to study? If 
these questions apply to you, you're 
not surprising your professors. 

Four UCSD professors, comment-
ing on the conditions that face today's 
UCSD undergraduates and the ways in 
which undergraduates respond to the 
surrounding conditions, all agree that 
students' abilities have not changed 
over the past few decades. The acade-
mic atmosphere at UCSD presents 
students with a world of new chal-
lenges that affects their goals and per-
fonnance. 
8oeII: c.r.... n. Acl ••• lc 

Many professors said that over the 
past few decades students have focused 
more on career goals at the undergrad-
uate level than ever before. 

"It's a career education that makes 
students competitive and achievement 
driven; said Philip Roeder, a political 
science professor at UCSD. 

As a bachelor's degree has become 
more a necessary step toward a suc-
cessful career, students have become 
more competitive at the undergraduate 
level. As the college degree has become 
more vital, students have attempted to 
attain it more quickly than ever before. 

"Students zip through their college 
rears and come out the other end mak-
Ing $80,000 per year,W said David 
Crowne, a literature professor at 
UCSD who has been teaching since 
1964. "Why would they stop and smell 
the. daisies?W 

In fact, a survey put out by the 
Career Services Center in 1999 showed 
that average income six months out of 

co llege was $35,600 with 10 percent of 
survey participants making $50,000 or 
more. 

Students also feel the pressure of 
deciding their career goals earlier in 
their education. 

"Education has a broader scope," 
said David Ringrose. a history profes-
sor who has been here for 26 years. 
"Now students try to fit themselves 
into fairly narrow slots." 

These new pressures have 
changed the way students view edu-
cation . 

"Students have a tendency to want 
to know about grades rather than to 
get taken up with a problem or a ques-
tion; Ringrose said . 

In fact. three of the professors 
interviewed said that undergraduate 
students rarely approach them about 
anything other than test scores and 
grades. 

Biology professor Melvin Green 
attributed this shift in education and 
research to the influence of big busi-
ness on education. 

· Students of the sciences have 
always been grade-driven; Green said. 
"However, the big change in students 
is that they seem much more interest-
ed in the financial aspects their career 
has to offer. n 

Green agrees that the entire field of 
science and research is changing and 
that this has (In impact on students of 
the sciences. 

"People who succeed today have to 
be both good scientists and good busi-
nessmen; Green said. 

With such a competitive job mar-
ket, it is not difficult to imagine why 
undergraduates today constantly have 
their careers in mind.

The political system of the 
United States is in shambles and 
III dil nger of breaking. A govern-
ment for the people? Ha . The 
InilJonty of govcrnmcntal action is 
motiva ted by personal greed or 
pol itical allegiance. Democracy in 
thc United States has become a 
farce in recent years, and I am 
complctely sick of it. 

What I am saying is not news 
to many people. Americans are 
upset about the state of our 
nation's fcderal government. The 
problem is that there are so many 
smaller problems behind the big-
ger one that nobody seems to 
kno\\' how to fix it. I don't claim to 
be a polincal genius, but I say that 
if you want to solve problems, you 
tirst have to identify those prob-
lems. Here's my best stab. 

In the wake of one of the most 
contested poli tical batiles in our 
nation's history, it has recently 
become stylish to pay lip service to 
ideals such as bipartisanship. 
Political talk shows are riddled 
with leaders from both major 
political parties discussing how the 
next fo ur yea rs will be full of pros-
perity because both parties want to 
put their differences behind them. 

Anyone who believes this gib-
berish hasn 't been watching 
closely enough. As soon as these 
politicians finish a sentence about 
compromise, they start another

find in the Ivy League circle. 

"One of the nice aspects about 
students here is that competition 
doesn 't turn into backstabbing: 
Roeder said. 

UCSD deals its undergraduates

Politics in the United 
States is flawed, but can 
be fixed with a little effort · 

sentence about how the plans of 
their political foe are completely 
off-base and how no form of that 
plan will be enacted. 

I think we have found our first 
problem: complete and utter party 
allegiance. This allegiance con-
sta ntly kills ideas that would be in 
the best interests of the country. 

Finding a solution for this 
problem is much more complicat-
ed than finding the problem itself. 
I believe the answer lies in a

greater political education for the 
American public. If people knew 
more about what their representa-
tives do, they would be in a better 
position to assess if these repre-
sentatives were acting in their best 
interests or in the best interest of 
the party to which they belong. 

The second problem with the 
system is the parties themselves. 
The Republican and Democratic 
parties have far too much power 
when it comes to nominating and 

introduced in 1964, and they're 
both nostalgic about the one-on-
one relationships they formed with 
the 180 undergraduates at the 
time. 

It's a two-way street that affects 
both the student's learning and the 
professor's teaching. 

"Your first or second year, no 
matter your major, you spend time 
in classes of 100 to 200 kids: 
Ringrose said. 

He said it's understandably dif-
ficult for undergraduate students 
to raise their hands in a lecture of 
200, and the only way he can get 
question-and-answer sessions in 
class is to structure the class so it 
cannot function without them. 

In accomplishing this, teaching 
assistants are a crucial component 
of the learning process. Green 

electing representatives, including 
the president. 

The Republican primary 
poignantly showed this problem. 
John McCain and George W Bush 
were locked in a dead heat after 
the first round of primaries. 
McCain's face was showing up on 
the cover of major magazines and 
his candor and fresh ideas were 
shaking up the face of the 
Republican political landscape. 
Then money was thrown at Bush 
and the contributors to Bush slan-
dered McCain every chance they 
got. The result? McCain went qui-
etly into the night and Bush went 
on to win the presidency. 

I am not saying John McCain 
should have won the election . I 
will say that the ability of the 
political system's big shots to 
choose who will represent the 
people of the United States solely 
based on their political power and 
their deep pockets is wrong. 

This practice is one of the 
forces that is hurting the legitima-
cy of the governmental system 
that the founding fathers set up 
212 years ago. Solving this prob-
lem is tricky because enforcing 
artificial regulations on groups of 
people is generally a violation of 
the Bill of Righis. However, I 
believe there is a way ou t.

said that undergraduate TAs have 
been "especially successful in 
helping students in lower division 
classes." 

Unfortunately, students · must 
choose to accept the help. Green 
hopes that something can be done 
for the students who do poorly on 
exams. 

"The poor students are the ones 
who never ask for help: Green 
said.

research and publishing has 
changed radically for professors. 
Publishing constantly and keep-
ing on the cutting edge of 
research has become crucial for 
securing tenure. This policy is 
common at universities around 
the country and the result is

A spokesperson would be a 

big help on Monday and Thesday, 
but don 't get your hopes up too 

. high . Even if you've worked up a 
good story, the boss may not be 
kt!en on hearing it. Discretion is 
more advisable from Tuesday 
through Thursday. Negotiations 
are tricky, especially if one of the 
players isn't playing by the same 
rules you arc. That person's motto 
is: "All's fair in love and war." The 
pressure on you starts to ease 
around Friday. That would be a 
good vacation day, if you can 
swing it. Saturday'S fabulous too 
- good for being with creative 
friends, traveling and even learn-
ing something new. Cool it on 
Sunday when you'll have a less 
responsive audience. 

Taurus (April 20·May 20) 
Be careful if you're involved 

with a creative project Monday. 
The seamstress in you is liable to 
cut two left sleeves. Better to do 
the planning then and Tuesday, 

teachers are spending less time on 
teaching and more time on 
research. 

"Every minute taken from 
research is a cost to us: Roeder 
said. The result is professors who 
are disinterested in teaching con-
tributing to a "devaluation of the 
profession: as Roeder puts it. 

Professors also have become 
less accessible outside of class. 

"You either have great 
researchers and mediocre teachers 
or mediocre researchers and great 
teachers; Ringrose said. 

Another disadvantage is the 
actual material that is produced by 
professors' research. Crowne said 
the research works published are 
directed toward an author's peers 
and therefore inaccessible to 
undergraduates.

you work together. Thursday'S

probably due to your com mon

you could teach classes, and 
maybe you should. Do what you 
ought to Sunday morning and 
what you can get away with that 
afternoon.

Although it seems I.ke you have 

nothing but green lights on 
Monday, take care. Don't launch 
into an expensive project. Wait 
until you've considered all1he pos-
sible consequences. That may not 
happen until Friday or Saturday. If 
you can wait until then your 
chances of success are much high -
er. As for the middle of the week? 
Research! And on Sunday? Rest 
and pay bills. Not necessarily in 
that order. 

ea.c.r (June 22-July 22) 
You get things fixed up the way 

you want them at home on 
Monday, but take care. The odds 
are good that your roommate or 
partner may not like what you've 
done. Be prepared, and have a 
"Plan B" ready on Tuesday.

I n terms of the sciences, Green 
said, "Research has always been 
important to professors. Tangible 
rewards such as promotions, salary, 
rank, space and respect came from 
research." 

Forty years ago, according to 
Green, one could succeed with a 
small lab, one assistant, one grant 
and one really good paper a year. 
This is not the case anymore. 
With these pressures. on profes-
sors, a distance naturally forms 
between them and the students 
they teach. 

"Everyone has a stake in the sit-
uation," Roeder said . "Students 
want to go to a university ranked 
among the top research institu-
tions, as do faculty."

Cell Phones Provide Easy Access to Friends and 
Family, but at a Cost to One's Health 
Recent studies indicate that repeated cell phone use can lead to serious health risks 
By KEllY WONG 
Staff Writer 

We have all been there. It is an 
awful experience: You need to 
make an important call and realize 
that you don 't have any change. 
Th~n you beg for change, only to 
walt 20 mll1utes for a public 
phone because the person ahead 
of you can't decide what he wants 
for dinner. Now that the phone is 
available, you can't find your 
friend's number. 

Luckily, the icon of the 21 st 
century, the cell phone, is here to 
save you from that aggravation. 
You can call your buddy on your 
cell phone using Pacific Bell's Free 
Mobile to Mobile. As the name 
suggests, it's free, you don 't have 
to wait for anyone else to finish, 
and you can store friends ' num-
bers so that all you need to do is 
press "TALK" to reach them. 
- These are some of the reasons 

why, acc.ording to a Gallup poll 
released on April 26, 2000, half of 
all Americans own a cell phone. 
Nearly half of all cell phone own-
ers are between the ages of 18 and 
29. Not surprisingly, 67 percent of 
them reported that they usc their 
phones every day or several times 
per week. According to the num-
bers, cell phones seem to be dom-
inating ollr lives. 

According to "Time" magazine, 
in the United States, cell phone 
users spend an average of 1 SO 
minutes a month talking on their 
cell phones. 

"This is the most popular prod-
uct known to man," said Ed 

Snyder, who follows wireless tech-
nologies for the Chase H&Q 
investment firm . "More cell phones 
will be sold this year than all the 
computers, TVs, personal digital 
assistants and pagers combined." 

What many people do not real-
ize is that wireless phones can 
affect our lives negatively as well as 
posi tively. A cell phone, like the 
microwave and broadcast antenna, 
emits radio waves that are a form 
of nonionizi ng radiation, which 
can harm body tissues in high 
doses. Microwave 

and launched a series of studies on 
their effects. 

Carlo found that the risk of 
acoustic neuroma, a benign tumor 
of the auditory nerve that is in the 
range of phone antenna radiation, 
was 50 percent higher in people 
who reported that they have been 
using cell phones for six years and 
more. The relationship between 
the amount of cell phone usage 
and this tumor seems to follow a 
dose-response curve, which 
means that the more a person uses 

a cell phone, the 
radio waves are 
1,000 times more 
powerful than 
those of a cell 
phone. However, a 
microwave keeps 
its waves inside a 
steel box, whereas 
cell phones are 
kept close to peo-
ple and are pressed 
to the head for 
long periods of 
lime. 

According to "Time 
-Magazine, " in the 
United States, cell 
phone users spend 
an average of 150 
minutes a month 
talking on their cell 
phones. 

higher the 
response for a 
tumor. 

Carlo sees a 
distinct correla-
tion between brain 
tumors occurring 
at the right side of 
the head when the 
phone was used 
on the right side of 
the head. 

He also found 

In another "Time" study, it was 
determined that when mice were 
exposed to two 3D-minute daily 
doses of cell phone radiation for 
up to 18 months, the mice devel-
oped twice as many brain tumors 
as the mice that were not exposed. 
Other findings link the radiation 
to changes in brain function . 

The New York Committee for 
Occupational Safety and Health 
recently reported the findings of a 
public health scientist, George 
Carlo. Carlo is one of the most 
outspoken critics of cell phones 

that the risk of a 
rare neuroepithelial tumor on the 
outside of the brain more than 
doubled in cell phone users. This. 
is, according to Carlo, a statistical-
ly significant increase when com-
paring people that use cell phones 
to those that do not. 

In 1995, Carlo recognized that 
digi tal phones were interfering 
with cardiac pacemakers. 

The Illost troubling of Carlo's 
findings was that radiation emitted 
from a cell phone antenna may 
actually cause functional chromo-
somal damages and that it follows 

IIr tv 

a dose-response curve as well. 
Another researcher, biologist 

Roger Coghill, also strongly 
believes that cell phones are harm-
ful to the human body. Coghill 
observed that mobile phones are 
linked to headaches and memory 
loss because radiation affects 
those part of the brain. 

He suggests that the waves 
generated by ce ll phones may 
damage the ability of white blood 
cells to fight off infection and dis-
ease. This is the result of a study in 
which Coghill took white blood 
cells from a donor, kept them alive 
with nutrients and exposed them 
to different electric fields. After 
seven-and-a-half hours, he saw 
that only 13 percent of the cells 
exposed to cell phone radiation 
remained intact and able to func-
tion. 

Coghill also claims that the 
body's immune system is partially 
controlled by electromagnetic 
fields emitted by the body, so cell 
phone radiation will damage the 
body's own electromagnetic fields. 
This will cause the dysfunction of 
one's immune system. 

Of course, some people are still 
skepti cal about the negative effect~ 
of cell phone use. Other studies 
have been less conclusive than 
those by Carlo and Coghill. Even 
the World Health Organization 
has stat~d that there is no definite 
answer to the relationship 
between cell phone usage and 
adverse health effects. It states that 
most experiments have only been

Senior Staff Writer 

There are few books out there

emotions from a person . ·Colors

the experience of reading this

"Colors of the Mountain" is 
the autobiography of Da Chen, a 
Chinese-American who grew up 
during Mao Zedong's Cultural 
Revolution in the 1960s and '70s. 
Chen focuses on his childhood,

labor camps, leaving his mother as 
the sole breadwinner of the fami-
ly. This was especially hard for a 
woman, considering the place and 
time. As the youngest of the chil-

the political parties such as major 
lobbies thus neutralized, 
Americans would be able to 
choose for themselves who they 
wanted representing them and not 
be led like lambs to the slaughter 
without even knowing it. 

The third and final problem is 
the simple idea of a career politi-
cian. Without term limits, politi-
cians vote in a way that allows 
them to be re-elected the next time 
they run. This may not seem like a 
problem because it makes these 
people do as. we want, but it actu-
ally is very threatening to the idea 
of a representative democracy. 

We elect people to make choic-
es for us for two reasons. We do it 
because it would be impossible to 
get anything done without repre-
sentatives, but we also do il because 

dren, there was little Chen could 
do to help. 

This being the case, Chen 
focused all his energy on school 
and getting into the University of 
Beijing. As any Chinese student 
can tell you, the pressure to per-
form well academically ' is 
immense. The weight on his 
shoulders came not just from his 
family, but from himself. Chen's 
sole desire was to bring his family 
out of poverty, and he viewed an 
education at the university as the 
way to achieve this. Blessed with 
an amazing mind and adamant 
will, Chen was successful irrdrag-
ging himself from the despair that 
threatened to swallow him. 

What is amazing about the 
book and about Chen is the way 
the story is conveyed to the read-
er. The Cultural Revolution in

normal people may not always 
know the implications of political 
decisions. We elect people we hope 
will understand these implications 
and will make the best decision 
even if it isn't popular. [n our cur-
rent system, however, making an 
unpopular but correct decision is 
political suicide. A lack of term lim-
its is incentive for representatives to 
make decisions that we don't actu-
ally want them to make. 

Nobody knows if doing these 
things would actually solve the 
problems our political system is 
currently facing. What we do 
know, however, is that the current 
"solutions" aren't working and we 
need to try something new. 

These adjustments seem as 
good a place as any to start the 
changes.

Every university is "keenly

emerged in the past 40 years, with 
no solution in sight.

The college student question-
naire, administered by Student 
Research and Information in 1999 
found that 58 percent of under-
graduates work. Furthermore, the 
majori ty of these employed full-
time students work over 11 hours 
per week. 

Working on the olllside may 
make time pressures morc intense.

Review: 
Book offers parallel of 
Chinese history 
Continued from page 17 
China is one of the worst exam-
pks of human depravity and sor-
rO\\. Y~t Chen retells his roming-
of-age not with anger-filled words 
and it mouth filled with spi tt', but 
with humor and humility. 

Lisa See, duthor of "On Gold 
Moulllain," said it best when she 
praised the book. "Born with the 
wretched politica l birthmark of 
beIng' a landlord's son, he has 
1 oked back at his life wi thout 
cyntcism or self-pity," Sce stated. 
"'Colors of the rvlountaln ' is a 
book of great digni ty." 

"Colors of the Mountain" is 
not merely a com ing-of-age mem-
oir. It gives readers an unadulter-
ated window into not only his 
past. but into China's past as we ll. 
Readers can witness the cruelty of 
comm unist China, the mass para-
noia of 3n enti re population and 
the underlying human compas-
sion that is buried beneath it all. It 
gives us the vantage point of li ving

The UCSD Guardian 

remembers being in college, when 
he and his friends read books "like 
demons' and soaked up all the 
information. Something about the 
academic atmosphere here, he says, 
makes someone who pores over 
books for hours seem like a "nut-
cake" for being too interested in a 
subject.

done on animals, and only short-
tenn effects have been considered. 

Ringrose agrees, seeking the 
lack of a niche at UCSD where 
"weird people who are smart can 
say things that make you mad and 
research things that are not promi-
nent." 

Students here are busy. They 
are no-nonsense. They have a pos-
itive attitude but also have a lot on 

. their plates. This appears to be the 
general view of the professors that 
were interviewed. 

All in all , prilfessors have a 
positive view of undergraduates. 
They see room for improvement, 
but mostly attribute the problems 
they see· to the environment in 
which UCS D students are educat-
ed. When as ked how students

ers . to survive. And to witness 
Chen, as a boy, standing above it 
all and succeeding is quite hum-
bling. 

Reading the book was a cathar- . 
tic experience for me, as I am sure 
it will be fo r anyone who picks it 
up and thumbs through the pages. 
At the time that I was reading the 
book, 1 was in dire straits, one 
might say. The book proved to be

inspiration in the book and in 
Chen's struggles to support his 
family and his education. Chen's 
ability to look back at his past and 
simply smile is something I find 
amazing. 

I highly recommend this auto-

According to the Gallup Poll, 
few Americans believe that cell 
phones pose a serious health risk. 
A mere 14 percent say that they 
have heard a great deal about cell 
phone and health risks, 37 per-
cent say tl:ey heard a moderate 
amount, 30 percent said that they 
heard a little, and 18 percent 
report that they have not heard 
such reports at all. 

When the sa me individuals 
were askea how serious they felt 
the risks actually were, only 8 per-
cent answered that risks were seri-
ous, 30 percent said somewhat 
serious, 35 percent said not very 
serious, and 18 percent said not 
very serious at all. 

evertheles~, long-term 
research is underway at tbe 
National Cancer Foundation , 
which will compare risk factors in 

biography to anyone, no matter 
his race, ethnicity or major. 
Despite our differences, there are 
some things that conncct every-
one: the will to succeed and the 
greatness of human achievement. 
"Colors of the Mountains" epito-
mizes these characteristics. 

Those interested in Chinese 
history will also find this book of 
great interest. It provides a win-
dow into the recent history of the 
People's Republic of China and 
the cultural revolution that 
shaped the nation. For those with 
interest in Chinese society, Chen 
gives a frank look at the tradition-
al Chinese family and the values 
instilled in it. The importance of 
education , putting the family first 
and pride of achievement are all 
touched on in this moving book. 

"Colors of the Mountains ' 
offers a range of emotions. Like 
the Pilgrim in Dante's "Divine 
Comedy," Chen travels, emotion-
ally and physically, from hell to 
heaven. The reader is likewise put 
on this roller coaster of feelings. 
Even the ending is bittersweet. I 
won't ruin it for you, but I will 
mention that a friend who also 
read the book was crying her eyes 
out by the last page.

Looks Strong 
The men's tennis team fares well in 2001 
Cal State L.A. Tennis Invitational. 

Sports Writer 

If this weekend was any type of 
barometer, the UCSD men's tennis 
team looks like it will have a good 
spring. The Tritons were weli-rep-
resented at the 2001 Cal State L.A. 
Tennis Invitational, held on jan. 13 
and 14. 

two Tritons tried to make their 
presence known. Unfortunately, 
the results were less than stellar. 
Cory Moderink was unable to get 
out of the first round and Dan 
Albrecht and Jeff Wilson bowed 
out in the second round. However, 
Everett Schroeter did make it to 
the quarter finals. 

The men 's doubles teams were 
not to be outdone in tournament 
play. In the lower flights, the Triton 
duo of Nejad and Schroeter took 
the title while in the upper flights 
the team of Chopra and Wifson 
survived until falling, 9-7, in the 
finals. 

• In the men 's singles lower level 
flights, three out of the four semi-
finalists were Tritons. 

Amir Nejad, Blake Wilson -
Hayden and Sameer Chopra were 
the talented three vying for the top 
spot. 

The final was exclusively made 
up of UCSD players, featuring 
Chopra facing off against Nejad. 
Chopra made quick work of his

than goons (yes, that's a hockey 
term) pummeling each other with 
roundhouses. Hockey is a game of 
skill, speed, instinct, and yes, brute 
strength . If you are a good player, 
there is a reason behind every sin-
gle movement, every flick of the 
wrists, nod of the head, and stuller-
step. 

Though it may not seem so on 
television , hockey is a game that is 
played at a blinding speed. And it 
takes immense skill to move and 
balance oneself while keeping an 
eye out for 100 

it shows they're not playing for the 
money; they're playing for the love 
of the game. 

I cannot find this devotion in 
a ny other sport. Football players 
complain about sprained wrists. 
Basketball players complain about 
sprained ankles. And, on the aver-
age, thes~ players get paid much, 
much more than a hockey player. 

The size of the contract is also 
testament to how much hockey 
players are underappreciated. The 
highest paid hockey player right 
now is the Dominator, Dominik 
Hasek. He clocks in $10 million a 
year, and rightfully so. Yes, $10 mil-
lion a year is absurd to pay for a 
person that plays a child's game but 
compared to other sports, $10 mil-
lion is mere change. Look at Alex

Hockey is a

Trust me, play-
ing goalie is, with-
out doubt, the 
most difficult posi-
tion to play, in any 
sport. A tiny, 
frozen, rubber 
puck flies off the 
stick of Al Mcinnis 
at 11 0 mph and is 
aimed stra ight at

players, fro m a pow<:r-forward the 
size of Keith Tkachuk to the sniper 
Peter Bondra, need soft hands to 
score goals or to make the floating 
pass over defending sticks. At the 
same time, fists of granite like 
those of Darren McCarty's or 
Chris Simon's are needed . to 
defend your team's sta rs. Pure 
skill, like that of jaromir Jagr and 
amazing puck control ski lls are 
also crucial. All the while, brute 
strength is required to barrel 
through a crushing check or two 
defenders. 

Compared to professional play-
ers from other sports, hockey play-
ers stand in a league of their own. 
From their mentality to their will-
ingness to sacrifice everything for 
the team while on ice, hockey play-
ers' devotion to the sport is unpar-
alleled. 

Hockey players play injured. 
Mike Modano played with a bro-
ken wrist in the Stanley Cup 
Finals in 1999. Brent Gilchrist 
took a puck in the mouth , brea k-
ing most of his teeth . He was shot 
up with pain killers and was out 

. on the ice the next period . 
Superstars like Steve Yzerman and 
Keith Primeau lay their bodies on 
the ice to block 90 to 100 mph 
slap shots. 

Though most people would say 
these players are crazy for laying 
their bodies on the line, it just 
shows how much these players 
love their sport. More importantly, 

to be in . 
Despite what most people say, 

watching hockey is far from being a 
bore. As mentioned before, it's a 
fast-paced game, and following the 
puck becomes easier. But the epit-
ome of human achievement in 
sports is winning the Stanley Cup. 
The Holy Grail of hockey is con-

side re~ by many, even hockey 
en thUSIasts, as the most difficult 
championship to win. 

Think about it. After 82 bone 
crushing, regular season games, 
NHL players still have to play up 
to another 28 playoff games. 
Playoff hockey is different. It's 
more intense. It's more electric. 
You can smell the tension in the 
air. The Cup is in sight and noth-
ing, not a broken ann or a concus-
sion will stop the players from get-
ting to it. Non-enthusiasts do not 
realize this, but there is no ending 
a playoff game if there is a tie after 

overti~e. The game continues, lit-
erally, IIltO the wee hours of the 
morning until the final goal is 
scored. 

That's why finally being able to 
drink from the Cup is so revered. 
Despite all that hockey players, 
both the professional and recre-
ational, arc willing to put on the 
line, they do not get the respect the 
game warrants. The history of the 
~ame is rich with long traditions. It 
IS a travesty that the sport is not 
recognized for what it is: the epito-
me of human sacrifice.

V-Ball: 
Despite inspired play, 
Tritons fall 
Continued from ..... 24 

The Gauchos, led by Andy 
Rivera with nine kills and seven 
blocks, were also playing their first 
game of the 2001 Mount Pacific 
Federation season. Rivera was 
backed up by Alex Lienert, who 
had eight kills, four blocks and four 
digs, and Dave Kohl. who picked 
up six kills and three digs to go 
with his two service aces. 

Another key performer for 
UCSB in the win was Anders 
Bengstsson, a 6-foot-5-inch sopho-
more and Swedish import who 
notched eight kills, with no errors 
out of 11 attempts, for a whopping 
.727 hitting percentage. The 
Gaucho bombs were allowed by 
setters Jeff Minc with 22 assists and 
Brett Malang with 18 in the win. 

The Tritons, despite the inabili-
ty to win any of their sets, were 
competitive in each and showed 
signs that the three-set sweep did 
not accurately portray the disparity 
between the two clubs. The play of 
Hite and Cogorno was once again 
impressive, as each had 10 kills, 
with Hite also adding nine digs and 
three blocks. Chen was once again 
the man in charge on offense for 
the Tritons, zapping the Gauchos 
with 12 kills, while throwing down 
four blocks in the loss. Setters Eric 
Perrine and Jordan Have supplied 
the juice to the hitters, with Perrine 
dealing up 22 assists and Have 
dishing 18.

Somewhat yes, but it does not

Theoretically, the Lakers have 
the potential for a lo-year 
dynasty, which would bring glory 
and Championships aplenty to a 
southland void of much to cheer 
about. With the victory the Gauchos 

climbed to 2-D, with a 1-0 record in 
the MPSF. UCSD, playing in its 
first official game, fell to 0-1, in-
league and overall. They will next

Something that disturbs me is 
how the media is blowing this

SWimming: 
Tritons looking good in 
the pool 
ContInued from paC. 24 
the meet at UCLA: 

McGihon said that UCSD's 
schedule, because it includes 
Division I schools like UCLA, will 
be good preparation for nationals. 

"You want to schedule with 
good teams so you can get experi-
ence against fast people: he said. 

Lopez competed in the 200-
meter breaststroke, the 2oo-mcter 
1M, and the 2oo-meter freestyle on 
Sunday, winning all three events 
with times of 

relay teams did well both days. 
Saturday'S relay team, comprised 
of Carolyn Kwok, Evelyn Kwok, 
Sharon Smith and Samantha 
Wong, came in second at UCLA 
(1 :41.10). A similar team, this one 
with swimmers Carolyn Kwok, 
Evelyn Kwok, Smith and 
Christina Guintu, finished first on 
Sunday with an even faster time 
(1:40.39). 

The Triton men's team came 
out with authority Sunday, putting 
in one of their best meets of the 
season. The team had put in a 
tough week of training after return-

in~ from winter break, and it was 
eVident. Leading the way was 
Christian Deck, a junior, who fin-

ished no lower than 
2:21.40, 2: 13.70 
and 1 :57.60, 

- respectively. At 
UCLA she posted 
an impressive sec-
ond place finish in 
the 1 00 breast-
stroke with a time 
of 1 :06 .37. 

Also bringing 
in notable times 
were Jennifer 
Watanabe, a 
sophomore, and 
Carly Ross, a 
freshman. 
Watanabe turned 
in two second 
place finishes in 
the 200 backstroke 
(2:04.87) and the 
200 1M (2 :11.18) 

"UCLA and 
Washington State 
were in the same 
situation, We didn't 
swim our very best 
on Saturday but we 
performed extremely 
well [on Sunday] 
and responded well 
from the meet at 

third in all of his 
events. 

Deck competed 
in the 400 medley 
relay, the 50 
freestyle (21.95), 
the 100 freestyle 
(47.89), and the 
200 freestyle relay, 
finishing second in 
all events except 
the 50 freestyle, in 
which he placed 
third . The 400 
medley relay team, 
made up of Deck, 
Luke Seed, Rusty UCLA." Jones and Ryan 
Wong brought in a 

- Scott Mc8IIIoII mark of 3:31.36. In

at UCLA and continued her 
strong performance on Sunday 
with top times in the 100 back-
stroke (59.23) and the 500 
freestyle (5:07.34). Ross claimed 
first place in the 200 freestyle on 
Saturday with a mark of 1 :54.25 
and the 100 freestyle with a time 
of 54.16 at home. 

The women's 200 freestyle 

relay, Deck, Seed, 
Daniel Fisher and Pat Carter fin-
ished in 1 :28.73. 

"Individually, this was one of 
my strongest mid-season meets; 
Deck said. "We're in a good posi-
tion and it looks promising for 
nationals:

with Deck's performance, both 
individually and with the relay

"He swam about as fast as he 
did in nationals last year; 
McGihon said. 

The next, and final, home meet 
for both teams will be on Jan. 27 
against California Baptist 
University. 

McGihon wants to lise that 
meet as a springboard for the con-

ference and national meets. 
The teams will have two weeks 

off before the conference finals in 
Long Beach, where the goal is to 
allow swimmers who have not yet 
qualified for nationals to do so. For 
those who have already qualified, 
the goal is ~ peak right arounri 
nationals. 

Lopez feels that the Tritons have 

a great shot at winning nationals. 
"We need to come together 

and perform like we know we 
can; she said. "It's going to take 
everyone." 

With the str.ong showing at

good position to achieve their 
goals.

So, why is it that these two 
can't learn that there is no "I" in

The ongoing feud between the 
two Laker superstars, which is now 
being splashed across California 
newspapers' sports pages, is child-
ish. Can't they realize that they 
need each other, and that without 
one another, they won 't win a 
championship? 

Each wants to be the focal point 
of the squad, and both have a very 
good argument. They both are, 
without question, superb athletes, 
and two of the most prominent 
players in the BA. 

Shaquille is the dominant big 
man in the league. He is like no

TOM VU 

A s a hockey fan atic, I feel it necessary to defend the sport that I follow with 
such a passion. From the time I 
started following hockey - when 
the Minnesota North Stars packed 
their sticks and pucks and migrat-
ed down south to Dallas - to now, 
I have noticed that hockey, as a 
sport, and the players that play it, 
do not receive the respect they so 
dea rly deserve. 

Perhaps I find this lack of 
respect as a personal insu lt 
because I too play hockey. OK, OK, 
so rollerhockey isn 't "real" hockey 
and intramural floor hockey is far 
from the ice as possible. And I'm 
not Canadian, Swedish, Russian, 
Finnish or Czech. I'm Chinese and 
Vietnamese. Hell. I don 't think 
there's even ice in Vietnam. 

Despite these setbacks, I still 
carry the mentality of a hockey 
player: The team comes firs t, pain 
is secondary. Sacrifice. Passion. All 
for the sport. 

To the untrained eye, the game 
of hockey is just a bunch of big

the boards. The critics are, well, 
correct. But hockey is much more

PORTS 
Triton$ Fall in Opener 
Volleyball struggles 
against Cal Baptist 
and UCSB in 
opening weekend 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Staff Writer 

The path to success is one paved with 
sundry obstacles, an age-old ~dage that the 
Triton men's volleyball team found to be true 
in its first weekend of-play. It opened the sea-
son with a non-league scrimmage on Friday 
night versus California Baptist University. 

Despite UCSD's pregame intentions, the 
more seasoned Cal Baptist team, which already 
has five games under its belt, took the show-
down in four sets. The Tritons were able to 
mustcr only a third set victory in a squeaker, 
30-27. The other three sets were all Cal 
Baptist, as they took the first 30-22, the second 
30-26, and the fourth and deciding by a tally of 
30-28. 

While they did present a challenge at times, 
especia lly in the close final set, the Tritons 
struggled against opposi tion that should not 
have been very difficult for them to beat. Cal 
Baptist's attack was led by Rafael Paal, who had 
13 ki lls and six digs to go along with his four 
service aces. Other standouts for the opposition 
were Rick Schapler, with 11 kills, seven digs and 
Matt Peacock, who compiled 10 kills and three 
digs. Teammate Ivan Topchiyski also chipped in 
with seven digs in the winning effort. 

There were a few instances of inspired play 
for the Tritons, who looked mainly to be get-
ting the kinks out and the wheels greased in 
their initial match. Senior standout Zach Hite 
looked strong, blasting 10 kills and picking up 
four digs. Donald Chen, the Triton MVP fol-
lowing their 2000 Division III Championship 
campaign, tied for the UCSD game lead with 
11 kills, also adding four digs. Brian Foote, the 
6-foot-6-i nch sophomore middle who is a new 
addition to this year's squad, also had 11 kills 
in the Triton effort . Another newcomer, 
Orange County College transfer Griffin 
Cogorno also showed signs of his impressive 
ability, clubbing nine kills and leading the 
team with seven digs in his first game wearing 
UCSD colors. 

Despite the bright play from these Triton 
leaders, the Tritons fell to their opponent in 
this match. Cal Baptist, 1-3 coming into Friday 
night's game, improved to two wins on the sea-
son and docs not look to be much of a con-
tender this season.

Triton swimming makes an impressive showing in meets with U9LA, Washington St. 
By GLORIA CHUNG 
Contributing sports writer 

The UCSD men 's and 
women 's swim teams participated 
in thei r first home meets of 2001 
last Sunday at Canyonview Pool. 
UC Davis and Claremont College 
were originally slated to compete 
in the meet, but Claremont was 
unable to attend at the last 
minute. 

The previous day, the women's 
team traveled to Los Angeles for a 
dual meet against Division I 
schools UCLA and Washington 
State University. 

Sandra Lopez, a junior who 
turned in stellar performances 
over the two days. said that the 
Tritons were happy to be back at 
home competing against a 

Division II school rather than 
Division I schools. 

"The conditions [at UCLA] 
were far from good. It was a men-
tally challenging meet; she said. 

Head coach Scott McGihon 
concurred that the facilities at 
UCLA's Men's Gym Pool were not 
very good. 

"There was no place to warm 
up or warm down; he said. 

However, McGihon refused to 
use the swimming conditions as 
an excuse. 

·UCLA and Washington State 
were in the same situation; he 
said. · We didn't swim our very 
best on Saturday but we per-
formed extremely well [on 
Sunday) and responded well from
