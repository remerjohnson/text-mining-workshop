SAN OJ EGO - Many 
graduating SDSU students 
have resorted to buying tickets 
to their May 27-29 graduation 
ceremonies from scalpers for 
up to $50 apiece. Demolition 
of the Aztec Bowl has left the 
Open Air Theatre as the only 
campus facility appropriate for 
the ceremonies. Graduates 
from the colleges of arts and 
letters, professional studies 
and fine arts, and business 
administration receive three 
tickets each, while graduates 
of the college of sciences 
receive five tickets each. The 
university plans to televise the 
.ceremonies at several campus 
locations, as well as on public-

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph Watson add ...... students on plans to 
build a new facility for the dance procram at lut nllM's A.S. Council meetl .... 

Atkinson Clears Way 
ForDance Building 
CONSTRucnON: $2.9 
million building is scheduled to 
be completed by Fall 1996 
By Nina Bouahton 
Staff Writer 

In an unexpected attempt to quell the contro-
versy surrounding the renovation of the Main 
Gym, Chancellor Richard Atkinson unveiled a 
plan yesterday morning to build a $2.9 million 
facility for the dance program. 

The chancellor had originally decided to reno-
vate the Main Gym for the use of the dance 
program, which would have prevented many 
recreational sports activities from using the build-
ing. After receiving numerous complaints from 
students and faculty, Atkinson chose to recon-
sider his decision last week. 

The new dance facility will be built near the 
Mandel Weiss Center for Performing Arts be-
hind Galbraith Hall. A capital projects summary 
dated May 14, 1993 estimates the cost of the 
building at $2.9 million, nearly triple the amount 
it would have cost to renovate the Main Gym. 

According to Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph Watson, the building will be 
finished in two years, and the planning phase 
will start immediately. 

"[The plan] will build on previous work and 
move very rapidly," said Watson. 

A.S. President Naomi Falk said Atkinson 
will raise the additional funds necessary to con-
struct the new building. 

"The chancellor told me it would be easy to 
find individuals to contribute," said Falk. "I feel 
[he] will be successful in finding them." 

Falk added that a gym balcony will be reno-
vated and the dance program will be able to use 
RIMAC in the meantime. 

Watson said the plan to build a new d!1nce 
facility was the best solution to the dilemna. 

"The Main Gym, RIMAC and the Rec Gym 
all work together to meet the needs of the cam-
pus," said Watson. "As a whole, they give the 
campus the maximum benefit. [Yet] certainly 
everyone wants to accommodate dance. [This] 
is an excellent solution from the overall campus 
perspective. "

Aflirmative 
Action May 
Have Helped 
Connerly 
CONTRACTS: Regent who is 
against race-based programs 
registered as minority owner 
By Jonna Palmer 
Associate News Editor 

UC Regent Ward Connerly came under fire 
this week after The San Francisco Chronicle 
published an article Monday detailing 
Connerly's choice to list his business as a mi-
nority contractor with the State Energy Com-
mission. 

Connerly, a staunch opponent of affirmative 
action, has announced his desire to phase out the 
UC's race-attentive programs. 

"Until we've recognized that affirmative 
action was intended to be temporary - to rem-
edy past discrimination, not to be tbe device for 
it - they will always look at Ward Connerly as 
a black regent, as a product of affirmative ac-
tion," Connerly said at the January regents meet-
ing. 

According to the Chronicle, Connerly helped 
win three different contracts for his firm, Cali-
fornia Building OffICials, by registering with a 
race-based commission program. The contracts, 
totaling more than S 1.2 million, were secured in 
1989,1993 and 1994. 

The Chronicle also cited the TV program 
"McNeil-lehrer News Hour," which quoted 
Connerly three weeks ago saying the govern-
ment should not set aside contracts for minority-
owned businesses. 

Connerly was not available for comment. 
However, according to The Los Angeles 

Times, Connerly said Tuesday that affirmative 
action has forced him, like many minorities, 
into a difficult position. 

"The classic problem you find is the circum-
stance in which I find myself," Connerly told the 
Times. 

"I haven't benefitted from [affirmative ac-
tion], yet I am being held out for public scrutiny 
and ridicule," he said. 

The Times also reported that Connerly will 
not claim minority-owner status for his business 
on a commission contract that he will bid on 
next week, which commission officials said will 
force his application to be rejected. According

A.S. Debates Support of Campus Affirmative Action Programs 
By Nina Boughton 
Staff Writer 

Putting a national debate on the 
campus agenda, the A.S. Council 
discussed the passage of a resolution 
in support of affirmative-action poli-
cies at last night's council meeting. 

Students supporting affirmative 
action urged the council to pass the 
resolution after learning that theA.S. 
Rules Committee voted against the 
resolution 0-4-1. 

Warren Sophomore Senator I rene 
Feldman said the Rules Committee 
voted down the resolution because 
of its political nature. 

Roosevelt Junior Senator Jason 
Davis, another Rules Committee 
member, said he did not support the 
proposed resolution because it only 
dealt with race as a factor. 

"It's not just race," said Davis, 
"It's a combination of things that 
[make up] affirmative action. We 
need to look at everything as a whole." 

Commissioner of Communica-
tions Farsam Shadab said he thought 
racism was institutionalized and that 
the meeting was not an appropriate 
forum for dealing with affirmative 
action. He also said current affirma-
tive-action policies may need to be 

rethought. 
"I ask why you ask to answer 

institutional racism with more of it," 
said Shadab. "[Also] it's a new era 
and maybe there's a reason these poli-
cies are being called into question." 

However, several members of 
the council were in favor of the 
resolution. ASUCSD Rentals Man-
ager Richard Freye said, "I think we 
really should support something like 
this ... it means we're not trying to 
exclude. I don't even see why we're 
thinking of not passing this." 

"It's a survival issue for us," said 
Warren student Poncho Guevara, 

"If you don 't stand for something, 
you stand for nothing." 

Roosevelt College Chair Alex 
Tom said he also felt the council 
needed to support the resolution. 

"There is discrimination out 
there," said Tom, "I see it. I feel it. 
This is something that needs to be 
addressed. We need to educate the 
students." 

Other students stressed that by 
passing the resolution, the A.S. 
members would simply be support-
ing the UC regents' current policy 
on affirmative action. Commis-

EVOLUnON: Bridgebetween the 'primordial soup' 
and life may have been RNA that acted like protein 

CALVIN a HOBBES by Bill Watterson 

By Rebecc. Hell 
Gutm1ian Reporter 

Two UCSD researchers have 
found important clues to determin-
ing the catalytic role of RNA before 
life existed. This new information 
provides critical insight into how 
life may have evolved from a "pri-
mordial soup" to the complex bio-
logical systems of today. 

RNA in living organisms acts as 
a messenger, carrying needed infor-
mation from DNA to build proteins. 
Proteins, among other functions, 
serve as enzymes 
which facilitate the 
chemical reactions 
necessary for life. 

with a number of molecules to pro-
duce compounds called substituted 
uracils. These substituted com-
pounds contain the components of 
many of the 20 amino acids which 
make up all proteins today. 

Miller and Robertson propose 
that if uracil had been prescnt in 
prebiotic times, it would have re-
acted with molecules such as am-
monia, hydrogen sulfide and hydro-
gen cyanide to produce certain 
"functional groups," or groups con-
tained in proteins which enable them 

to catalyze reac-
tions. 

"We think that... 
by putting these 
functional groups 
on RNA, the mol-
eades are ready to 
carry out all the 
chemistry that's 
done by proteins 

"The 
significance of 

now," Miller said. 
Therefore, the role 
that is now played

In the May 5 is-
sue of Science, 
Stanley Miller and 
Michael Robertson 
of UCSD's Depart-
ment of Chemistry 
provided evidence 
that certain modi-
fl8d RNA molecules 
Illy have been able

tions, a function per-
formed almost en-

t~y, by proteins 
today. RNA wasb'-
merly believed to 
have bad a miDi mal 
capacity to calISe 
cbemical reactions. 

"The signifi-
cance of these find-
ings shows ... that

were likely to have 
been much more di-

like., to have 
been much 
more diverse 
than prevlousl,

_ Stanley Mill" ids. "One can pre-
UCSO Researcher dict that the 20 

amino acids were 
verse than previ- Depart~nt of Chemistry selected because 
ously thought," Miller said. 

The finding supports the "RNA 
world," theory, which suggests that 
RNA served both a genetic and cata-
lytic function in prebiotic time. To-
day, these functions are performed 
by DNA and proteins or enzymes, 
respectively. 

Many scientists, however, do not 
subscribe to the RNA world theory, 
because the RNA present in today's 
cells is not considered sufficiently 
complex to perform the catalytic 
functions needed to sustain life. 

To explore these possible func-
tions, Miller and Robertson recre-
ated the conditions which are be-
lieved to have been present 3.7 bil-
lion years ago, including gases, 
chemicals and temperatures. 

The researchers then mixed 
uracil, one of the four components 
of RNA, with formaldehyde, a mol-
ecule presumed to be abundant at 
this time. The result was 
hydroxymethyluracil (HMU), a 
compound which is able to react 

these were used by prebiotic RNA 
molecules," said Miller. "[Modified 
uracils] are the the missing link be-
tween the RNA world and the DNA-
protein world," he added. 

One problem the researchers 
faced was the random structure of 
prebiotic RNA. In modem RNA, 
proteins ensure that it contains a 
specific sequence that determines 
its role in the cell. In the absence of 
regu latory proteins, there is no con-
trol mechanism in the ordering of 
the molecules. 

Miller and Robertson propose 
that even with a random arrange-
ment of these molecules, a collec-
tion of such substituted RNA mol-
ecules, forming compounds called 
ribozymes, could provide enough 
catalytic capability to provide for 
primitive biological processes. 

Followup research on the sub-
ject includes reacting the modified 
RNA with other molecules to ex-
plore the compound's ability to af-
fect chemical reactions.

Theatre Deparlment Chair 
Jim Carmody said he was ec-
static about the decision. 

"We are all sort of smiling 
over here," said Carmody. "The 
department is eX",*ordinarily 
grateful to the administration for 
coming up with la] solution that 
is so much-to our advantage. I 
think it's making a positive state-
ment about the arts on Ihis cam-
pus." . 

Recreational Director Chuck 
Gormley said he also suppOrts 
the plan. 

"My position has always been 
to leave the Main Gym as a mul-
tiuse facility... rather than an 
exclusive-use facility," said 
Gormley. "Ithink [the new build-
ing] would be wonderful." 

Falk said she was also pleased 
with the solution. 

"The council took a position 
of support for the dance students 
[bu tJ also recognized that the 
Main Gym was an undesirable 
solution to [their] problem be-
cause of the wide varieties of 
activities it houses and the broad 
base of students to which it ea-
ters," slated Falk in a memo dated 
May 10. 

Falk stressed, however, that 
she was dissatisfied with the 
overall process. 

"The decision to renovate the 
gym has been made hastily within 
the last three monlhs, with com-
plete disregard to the long-last-
ing impact it will have on many 
students," Falk wrote in a letter 
to Atkinson. "The faci that no 
effort was made to inform stu-
dents of the decisions Ihat were 
bei ng made or to allow them the 
opportunity to participate in the 
discussions is reprehensible."

Administration Should 
Keep Its Paws Off KSDC 

KSOC, the A.S. closed-circuit TV channel, is an idea 
whose time has come - almost. Yet, because administra-
tors currently outnumber students on the oversight commit-
tee, its membership is questionable. A.S. President Naomi 
Falk submitted an amendment to the KSDC Cable Cbarter 
which would add more voting, as well as ex-officio, stu-
dents to the committee. 

Currently, the number of voting administrators is ap-
proximately the same as the number of voting students, but 
there are no ex-officio student members on the committee 
- all the ex-officio members are administrators. 

The station would cost just over $50,000 to get it run-
ning: A.S. allocated $24,770 last October and it has planned 
to provide an additional $33,835.50 for buying equipment, 
renovation and cable installation. This is student money -
the administration would not contribute anything finan-
cially. Yet, because of the their overrepresentation on the 
oversig. It committee, administrators would have a large 
measure of control over the "students'" cable station. The 
administration seems to be on a quest to control KSDC. 

Furthermore, by design of Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph Watson, the committee does not even include 
any KSOC personnel. Falk's amendment would add four 
ex-officio KSDC managers to the committee, as well as the 
KSDC general manager as a voting member. 

Students should outnumber administrators on the over-
sigbt committee - this should be the case witb both voting 
and ex-officio members. Hopefully, Falk's amendment will 
change the situation to benefit UCSD students, who would 
run KSDC and for whom the station was originally in-
tended_ ~ 

Death Threats Show 
Disdain for Free Speech 

Last weekend, Guardian Staff Writer Peter Chang 
received life-threatening phone calls. The anonymous caller 
referred to Chang's scathing commentary on Voz 
Fronteriza, UCSD's Cbicano/Latino newspaper. 

The dealh-threat tactic is a cowardly and disgusting 
attempt at making one's voice heard. Not only did it violate 
Cbang's rights, but it also illustrated a frightening disregard 
for free speech. It is both surprising and alarming that 
anyone would stoop so low as to threaten someone's life 
over an opinion commentary. 

When people disagree with a commentary which appears 
in the Guardian, they should write a letter to the editor. In 
this case, they could have even written letters to the editor 
of Voz Fronteriza. But under no circumstances should 
anyone have threatened Chang's life. This act was nothing 
less than barbaric, and only gave more publicity to the very 
commentary the caller found intolerable. 

Thumbs Up to 
Chancellor Atkinson ... 

.. .for finally investing money in a worthwhile construction 
project - the TheaterIDance Department's new facility. 
After the Library Walk fiasco, it is refreshing to see that the 
chancellor actually evaluated student needs, instead of 
blindly ordering a useless outpouring of cement for a "view 
corridor." At least thi~ new facility would actively serve 
student needs, since the theater department has been lacking 
appropriate dance facilities for years. 

Just last week, Atkinson was still planning on revamping 
the Main Gym for dance. But this would hurt UCSD's 
athletic and recreational needs, since tbe gym bas long been 
bome to club sports and rec classes. Constructing the new 
dance building would not only belp the theater department, 
but it would not interfere in other student activities, since the 
Main Gym will remain unaffected.

COMMENTARY: You thought hitting the books and attending class 
everyday would prepare you for life after school, but you were wrong 

People forget that college is 
not simply a time to party, meet 
cool people and hang oul. II's a 
time to prepare for a viable ca-
reer. With this in mind, under-
graduates can take advantage of 
a variety of methods to prepare 

use anything specific from college classes in your 
actual job. English majors, do you actually think that 
your ability to analyze assonance in quotations from 
"Macbeth" will ever be of any direct use? History 
majors, do you really think anyone will ask you for 
your views on the Monroe Doctrine after graduation? 
As for all of you in sociology, communications, an-

for the " real 
world." As you 
will see, this 
doesn 't have to 
be a boring en-
deavor. 

First, learn 
to drink foul-
tasting bever-
ages. The No. 1 

drink of the real world is coffee; any-
one observing patrons at the Grove 
or Roma would certainly think that 
college is nothing but four years of 
coping with the combination of hard 
work and caffeine. This training is un-
doubtedly sound preparation for the 
real world. 

However, an extended family of 
beverages awaits the workforce new-
comer. When you're taking clients out 
to dinner in the real world, a basic 
know ledge of wine is helpful, and you 
need at least one "grown-up drink" 
which you can order during cocktail 
hour. Most "college drinks" don't pre-
pare you for this: Lucky Lager and 
King Cobra generally aren't favored 
in the finer establishments, and rum 
and Coke simply won't do. Choose a 
drink and stick with it, and avoid 
things with umbrellas and pineapple 
slices unless you want to be consid-
ered a lightweighl. 

Aside from mastering adult drink-

English majors, 
do you actually 
think that your

do you really. 
think anyone will 
ask you for your 
views on the 
Monroe DoctrIne 
after graduation? 

Friday fever. 

thropology, etc.: I think you get my 
point. Liberal arts majors will be bet-
ter thinkers, better writers and will be 
loaded with seemingly important 
facts which they later realize are 
trivia. Therefore, disregard thoughts 
of tailoring a specific curriculum to 
prepare yourself for a job. Take what 
you think you need - or what looks 
cool. 

College is excellent preparation for 
learning how to make excuses. No one 
seems to write papers or study for ex-
ams until the night before the deadline. 
Those who can ' t pull it off in time will 
need to resort to pleas with the profes-
sor. Think of him as a representation 
of your future bosses, who will listen 
to your excuses with equally skeptical 
ears. 

People in the real world build en-
tire careers around excuse-making; 
prepare for it now. I obviously did not 
use my college years to adequately 
develop this skill. My parents' moral 
Gestapo tactics succeeded to the point 
that whenever I lie, I tum beet red and 
start stammering. But just because my 
excuses don't work, it doesn 't mean 
yours can'l. I've watched people glide 
through college and graduate school 
with a succession of more dead grand-
mothers than anyone could possibly 
have. This skill is essential for when 
you phone in sick with a bad case of 

ing habits, how else can undergraduates prepare for 
the real world? One of the great myths about educa-
tion is that you take classes in college to prepare for 
a subsequent career. While this may be true in the 
sciences or engineering, liberal arts majors who have 
been gainfully employed in the real world know this 
to be an utter falsehood. You probably won't ever 

Another way to prepare for the real world is to ac-
climate yourself to the timetable of working men and 
women. Most people would think I'm suggesting you 
start getting up at 6:00 a.m. But I assert that other meth-
ods are more effective.

CHANG IS IGNORANT OF CHICANO STRUGGLE 
Editor: 

It is obvious that Peter Chang has 
never known spiritual struggle and 
has never seen people's lives de-
stroyed by poverty or prejudice. By 
attacking Voz Fronttriza in his recent 
commentary ("Hypocrisy Alive and 
Well in VoJ.Fronterizo ," May 4)with 
childish insults and narrow rhetoric, 
he attacks the expression of people 
who live the struggle everyday. 

Chang writes, "In a modem, capi-
talistic society, effort and talent and 
a touch of luck are all anyone needs." 
Tell that to the young Chicana who 
is surrounded by violence and can-
not afford the high price of a college 
education. Tell that to the young man 
who is seen by mainstream society 
as a wetback, a thief or a gangster 
because of his skin or clothes. Tell 
that to the senior citizen who is sus-
pected of being "illegal" because of 
his accent and traditional ways. 

We do not have time to listen to 
you, Chang. We are too busy trying 
to survive in your "modem, capital-
istic society." We are too busy fight-
ing for our rights as human beings.

..... '. Attack of M»z 
ConIInenWy Is IbIdst 
Editor: 

Harry Barra demonstrated that 
hatred aod intolerance are by no 
means color blind (Readers ' Forum, 
"Chang's Right-Wing Antics and Ig-
norance," May 8). I guess nobody 
should be able to disagree with 

Barra. It did not seem to bother him 
that somebody threatened the life of 
someone who was horrible enough 
to disagree with the paper which 
Barra edits. Not only is he oblivi-
ous, but it seems he condoned these 
death threats, despite saying that 
nobody involved in his publication 
was responsible for them. 

In addition, Barra's letter shows 
his own intolerance and batred. Ap-
parently, anybody who does not agree 
with, and is bad enough to criticize, 
Voz Fronleriza must be a racist Barra 
tries to change tbe subject in bis let-
ter when he gives his history of how 
racism has affected Chinese Ameri-
cans. Would he have done this if Pe-
ter Chang's last name were Smith? I 
can see some parallels, but it seems 
that Barra isn't really addressing the 
criticisms directed at Voz Fronteriza. 

I'm not sure exactly what Barra 
means when he brings up Pete 
Wilson's and Bill Clinton 's ances-
tors. Does he have proof that their 
actual ancestors the crimes he de-
scribes, or were their ancestors 
merely guilty of being white, 
thereby being guilty by association? 

Barra is even more successful at 
making a fool of himself by attacking 
Chang's persona ra~r than his writ-
ing. In saying that Chang wants to be-
come white, he seems 10 imply either 
that all white people are bad or that 
all bad people are white. Chang is not 
a "traitor" to Asian Americans merely 
because he does not agree with Voz 
Fronteriza or Barra. 

Besides his condoning death 
threats, what concerns me most 
about Barra is his lack of respect for

free speech. Not only did Barra mis-
interpret Chang's article, but he also 
claims that "These are things which 
would get anyone a righteous ass 
kicking anywhere else ... bul because 
he is in an environment of education, 
he gets away with writing racist, 
KKK-style remarks without suffer-
ing tbe consequences. ~' Comparing 
anyone witb a differing opinion to 
tbe KKK is disgusting. I guess "suf-
fering the consequences" means thai 
Chang should get a "righteOus ass 
kicking" for voicing his opinion. 

In addition, Barra states, "Maybe 
Peter should take an ethnic studies 
class or two." I guess the world 
Barra wants to live in is one in 
which people who disagree with 

him get a beating and are then re-
educated. Societies like this have 
existed before, but hopefully, UCSD 
won't turn into one of them.

watt. Stu ........ Over 
... OwnAliu ........ 
Editor: 

Peter Chang'S commentary 
("Hypocrisy Alive and Well in Voz 
Fronleriza," May 4 ) is ignorant and 
uninformed. Chang, employing 
popular right-wing rhetoric, contin-
ues his wordy evasion of genuine 
issues in his attack on Latinos. 

Chang intentionally misrepre-
sents the awareness of Voz FronJeriza 
as "paranoia." I would hasten to re-
mind him that the empowerment 
which follows from this awareness 
is not synonymous with "victimiza-
tion." Chang's equation of what he 
calls "victimhood" with an elaborate 
form of paranoia denies historical 
realities. To accuse Voz and La Raza, 
in general, of "victimhood," is to 
appeal to a current "bulZWord" of the 
right which ignores the legacy of rac-
ism in communities of color. 

Chang conveniently constructs a 
straw man argument with his stereo-
typical references to what he calls the 
"dilution" of college degrees, as well 
as the "crime," "fraud" and govem-
ment infiltration ofthe Chicano com-
munity, while insinuating that 
Latinos are all too willing to consume 
and become addicted to drugs. In 
both cases, Chang strays from his 
original argument to attack an exag-
gerated version of the true issues fac-

i 

ing the Chicano community. 
His assumption that Chicanos or 

Latinos or women are mindless, blind 
and weak followers is equally ridicu-
lous. According 10 Chang, "they," the 
"disenfranchised," tum to yet-to-be 
identified leaders who misguide and 
deceive them. Who are these fascist, 
deceptive leaders? The staff of Voz 
Fronlerizo?! Laura Rodriguez?! Los 
Zapatistas?! Cesar Chavez?! 

And what exactly is Chang try-
ing to attack as hypocritical? Voz 
Fronteriza itself? Chicanos and 
Latinos in general? La Raza? The 
Women 's Movement? Chang 
stumbles over his own argument. 
He extends his attack on one edito-
rial in Voz Fronterizo to the entire 
paper. From the paper, he attempts 
to dismiss not only the issues fac-
ing the Chicano/Latino community 
at large, but also the causes and 
progress of entire movements. 

Chang would have "the people" 
reject collective resistance and em-
powerment in favor of silent accep-
tance.1 question his advice to patiently 
bear oppression. The demographics of 
California aJone demand a persistent 
and more aggressive challenge 10 the 
system. While Chang can continue 
trying his "luck" at capitalism, I would 
suggest that he spend more time act-
ing on pressing sociopolitical issues, 
rather than continue ridiculing them. 
Meanwhile, Voz Fronteriza will per-
sist in exposing the hypocrisy of this 
system aod in empowering tile 
Chicano and Latino community.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Thunday,~ayll,1995 

voz COMMENTARY WAS OBLIVIOUS TO HISTORY 
Editor: 

Peter Chang's characterization 
of the idea that the government 
brings drugs into the barrios as 
"paranoia" is ignorant and danger-
ous. Unfortunately, the assertions in 
Voz Fronteriza have a well-docu-
mented factual basis. 

The U.S. government was in-
strumental in establishing the hard-
drug racket right after World War 
II, when it used Mafia connections 
to undermine the French Commu-
nist Party and French labor move-
ments. Involvement in the heroin 
trade out of the "Golden Triangle" 
(Laos, Burma and Thailand) con-
tinued the trend. The CIA helped 
implement this trade in 1965 to re-
cruit a mercenary army of highland 
tribesmen for counterinsurgency 
operations in Laos. U.S. involve-
ment in Central America drug rack-
ets as part of the Contra-aid scan-
dal is also well documented. Quite 
simply, the clandestine, quasi-legal 
and illegal operations in which the 
CIA and other shady government 
agencies engage require hidden 
funds and resources. These are 
most easily available through orga-
nized crime, which expects a quid 
pro quo. 

On a more subtle level , the 
United States has consistently 
shown that it is not interested in 
stopping the flow of drugs into 
tta.ole communities, despite its 

"~war" posturing. By the CIA's 
o1heatimales, far mOle chemicals 
'f1ow into Utin America t~aa are 
required for any legal purposes. 
Th. c:hK';c I~ are ,,~ed for 
heroin and cocaine processing, 

There has been no significant at-
tempt to counter the diversions. 
Furthermore, drug trafficking could 
be significantly reduced by pros-
ecuting U.S. banks which are 
known to launder drug money. A 
Treasury Department program 
called "Operation Greenback" was 
poised to do just that in 1979, but 
floundered because of a lack of in-
terest by the Reagan-Bush admin-
istrations. Of course, such activi-
ties would hurt U.S. chemical and 
banking companies. Moreover, 
U.S. judicial policies enable those 
with some clout in the drug-impor-
tation business to go free while 
ruthlessly prosecuting street-level 
dealers. This is the origin of the 
"paranoia" about police invading 
the barrios. 

A massive police presence was 
introduced into poor neighbor-
hoods in the mid-1970s on the pre-
tense of battling drugs. Interest-
ingly, this coincided directly with 
the persecution of socially progres-
sive organizations in the inner city, 
a huge influx of illicit drugs, the 
formation of drug-trade centered 
gangs, a disintegration of commu-
nity, a massive incarceration rate 
for young men of color, a drop in 
people of color attending educa-
tional institutions, the 
criminalization of Latinos and Af-
rican Americans and an ongoing 
media blitz which turned American 
people's attention away from the 
budget deficit and to the "drug 
'War. " 

Contrary to Chang's assertion 
that "anybody" can "make it" in this 
society with ingenuity and a bit of

luck are the realities of an inner-city 
educational system which cannot 
prepare students for anything more 
than jobs at the lowest-wage tier, a 
job market which does not even pro-
vide adequate employment at that 
level and a climate of cynical hope-
lessness, all of which stem directly 
from our government's policies. 
This makes drug dealing the most 
rational vocational choice from a 
capitalist standpoint. It is therefore 
not surprising that, in such a des-
perate environment, an ample mar-
ket exists for substances which pro-
vide an escape from an intolerable 
existence.

Cart LeBOX 

EdItor: 
The Executive Board of the As-

sociation of Student Employees 
(ASE) was troubled by a letter 
which recently appeared in .. the 
Guardian (" ASE Member¥ Are 
Lucky to Have Jobs at All," May 
1). In his letter, Ed Wagner exhib-
ited both his ignorance of labor is-
sues at UCSD as well as his inabil-
ity to voice his opinion about such 
issues without having to resort to 
juvenile and mean-spirited per-
sonal attacks. 

First of all, Wagner obviously 
never took the time to educate him-
self about the ASE or the two-day 
walkout before he wrote this letter 
- otherwise, he would never have 
made the unsubstantiated claim that 
"graduate students want more 
money." Nowhere in our list of de-
mands or the issues which we felt 
were central to our struggle did the 
ASE request an increase in pay. The 
issues we stressed were our rights 
to unionize and to have a more 
democratic workplace, a more eq-
uitable and accountable grievance 
procedure, continued and/or in-
creased health benefits, gaining 
some control over class size, in-
creased fee remissions, collective 
bargaining rights and other non-in-
come issues. 

Wagner claims the ASE wants 
this money "from a university that 
has no money." TheASE recognizes 
the time of crises which the UC sys-
tem is bearing. Because of this, the 
ASE wants some assurances that 
academic student employees won't 
be made to feel the unfair brunt of 
budget cuts which wiU be coming 
in the future. Obviously, the ASE 
has no intentions of making 'de-
mands on the UC system which we 
feel would make it impossible for 
the university to run. We simply 
want to be able to have some say 
and some protection in our own 
workplaces. 

Another claim Wagner makes is 
that we are already "grossly over-
compensated" for the work we do. 
Many teacher's assistants, lecturers, 
readers and others in our union put 
in many more hours per week than 
for which we are paid. Since most 
TAs receive less than $14,000 per 
year for the tireless work we do, the 
ASE fails to see how this figure can 
be construed as "overcompensa-
tion." 

As to Wagner's characterization 
of the hygiene of our members, we 
feel this kind of mudslinging speaks 
more of Wagner's inability to en-
gage in intelligent discourse than the 
bodily habits of anyone in our 
union. 

The ASE hopes that in the future, 
if people wish to comment on the 
activities of our union, that such in-
dividuals get their information 
straight before engaging in public 
debate.

STRATEGIES: 
Give yourself plenty 
of long weekends 
ContInued from ..... 4 

Although as a college student I 
knew nothing about the real world, 
I realized later that my strategies 
displayed amazing perception. I 
had amysterious, intuitive under-
standing that no class offered be-
fore 10:00 a.m. could possibly have 
anything good to offer, so I imme-
diately struck those from my sched-
ule. I had no choice but to sleep in 
those mornings. It was a sacrifice, 
but I was resolved to stick by my 
strategy, the wisdom of which I 
fully realized after starting full-
time work. 

In my office, we started work at 
8:30 a.m., and I was always on time. 

But between 8:30 and 9:00, the half-
hour f1iea by. You have to drink your 
coffee (or even make it, if no one 
else hu), then you must greet all 
your co-workers and hear all that 
has transpired in their lives since 
5:00 p.m. the previous evening. 

~ore likely than not, your boss will 
have something to say to you, as 
well, about the day's meetings or 
other business. 

Next thing you know, it's 9:00 
a.m., which means it's lunch hour 
on the East Coast, so you can't 
phone your clients in North Caro-
lina or wherever. Of course', every-
thing you need to do is contingent 
on a piece of information from those 
clients, so it must be shelved until 
you can reach them. As a result, 
nothing gets done until 10:00 a.m. 
anyway. 

I also displayed keen foresight 

The UCSD Guardian 

in perceiving the meaning of Fri-
days in the real world. Aa an un-
dergraduate, I somehow under-
stood that Fridays were just not 
good days for classes. Little did I 
know that this was sound prepara-
tion for a world which never does 
any work on Fridays. Between 
coming in late, leaving for lunch 
early, returraing from lunch late and 
leaving for the day early, a typical 
employee will put in a solid 14 
minutes of work on a typical Fri-
day. 

Therefore, I found my boycott 
of Friday classes to be beneficial 
training for employment. Those 
three-day road trips to the slopes 
and Santa Cruz were truly valu-
able. 

So, as you can see, one's prepa-
ration for the "real world" need not 
be as painful as one might expect.

8 NEWS 

CONNERLY: 
ContInued fnMn ..... 1 
to the Times, Connerly will then file 
a lawsuit against the commission. 

UC Student Association Execu-
tive Director Glen Magpantay said 
he was shocked by the article. 

"I am totally amused by the irony 
that this situation presents," he said. 

"It 's pretty obvious that we have 
a regent who says 'no' to affirma-
tive action, yet he turns around and 
benefits from affirmative action," 
he added. 

However, Magpantay added he 
thought Connerly only did what most 
business owners would do. 

"My honest guess is that Ward 
applied for this money because it 's 
just another promotion [for his busi-
ness]," said Magpantay. 

TIIANKS to 
the cooperation of these 

businesses, you can still rip 
out your favorite Guardian 
coupon at any of these off-
campus distribution sites ...

Hey, on college campuses those "in the know" are the ones who rule. 
And it's not just about being smart in the classroom, it's about being wise 
with your wallet as well. So if you want a great low price on a collect call, 
just diall SOO-CAll-ATI. It always costs less than l-800-COUECI A/ways. 

There are lots of tricky things for you to learn at college, but here's 
something that's easy: KNOW THE CODE, and save the person on the 
other end some serious money. You'll be glad you did.

UCSD CLUB SPORTS 
ROUND-UP 

SHARKS: 
Another miracle? 
ContInued from ..... 12 
far between, Who wants to go to a 
game with a decided conclusion, 
when one can just catch the pre-
dictable, yet entertaining high-
lights on SportsCenter (with all of 
its witty commentary)? 

Equestrian 

Is there something 
funny in the drink-

ing water at 
Michelle 
Avila's home? 
Perhaps that's 

one way to account for her miracu-
lous rise to the topoflHSA rankings. 

As an active member of the 
UCSD equestrian team, Avila's up-
ward mobil ity culminated in herfi rst-
place finish in the Individual Novice 
Equitation Flat class at the IHSA 
National Horse Show on May 4-7. 

Taking place on the campus of 
Colorado State University, the show 
highlighted some of the top riders 
from across the country. The fact 
that UCSD sent two riders is a testa-
ment to how quick the road to cham-
pionship form was, for both Avila 
and her Triton teammates. 

"It's been a great y~ar for our 

team," Avila said. "The dedicated 
riders did very well this season." 

Founded only last year, the 
UCSD equestrian team entered into 
the prestigious IHSA conference, 
which was established in 1967 and 
includes 225 member colleges from 
35 states and Canada. In 'addition, 
the IHSA represents 4,500 riders. 

The upstart Tritons made an im-
mediate impact in the conference, 
regularly holding their own against 
established contenders. 

This year was "Chapter Two" of 
the UCSD success story. In order to 
qualify for Regionals, riders had to 
tally points by placing first through 
sixth at seasonal shows. Two Triton 
riders were up of the task: Kristin 
Smith and Avila. 

At Regionals, Smith grabbed the 
championship in the Novice Equita-
tion Over Fences class. Her team-

mate captured the reserve cham-
pion award in the Novice Equita-
tion Flat class. 

These exceptional efforts qua li-
fied both UCSD riders for the 
highly competitive National Horse 
Show. Smith performed admirably 
at Nationals, dashing to 10th place 
in herciass, wbileAvilaconquered 
all, gamering the gold. 

"Only two people qualified tbis 
year, but the team is rapidly im-
proving," Avila said. "We expect 
the whole team to go next year." 

Both riders credit their success 
to their coach and trainer, Lilli 
I ngasci , and their sponsors, Robyn 
Parsky and Vivianne Warren. 

"We have a good coach ... she's 
very nice and very effective at pin-
pointi ng what a rider needs to work 
on," Avila said. 

-Tedd Ladcl 

In any case, the NHL has the 
seven-game series in the first 
round, so the Flames still have a 
chance to avoid being ousted by a 
team whose regular season record 
could best be described in one 
word: losing. 

Of course, if this were the NBA 
playoffs, these Bay Area hacks 
would need only one more win to 
eliminate a team which is much 
more deserving of being in the Big 
Show. 

Nonetheless, I don't think 
Arturs Irbe and the rest of the San 
Jose Sharks could muster enough 
luck to conquer the rest of the 
playoffs even if they do win this 
one - and even if they skated on 
horse shoes with four-leaf clovers 
tied in their hair and changed their 
name to the Fighting Irish.

12 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian Thursday, May 11, 1995 

KR8FTY 
DAN KRAFT 

The Real Way 
To San Jose 

Is it ju.t me, or have the 
San Jose Sharks made it their 
collective mission in life to 
prove that cliches like "any-
thing can happen in the 
playoffs" and "once you get to 
the playoffs, the regular season 
doesn 't maller," are unfailingly 
true? 

UCSD Blows Out Gusties 

In the 1994 playoffs, San 
Jose knocked off the top-
seeded "Motor City" Red 
Wings, who subsequently 
endured criticism for their 
John Starks-esque perfor-
mance. This year's version 
features those big predatory 
fish at it once again, searching 
for their second consecutive 
post-season miracle. 

And this year's certain 
victim? Why, the Calgary 
"going up in" Flames, of 
course. Their name is certainly 
appropriate considering their 
recent untimely collapse. 

San Jose has captured the 
first two games of the best-of-
seven series 0/1 the road and is 
now in a position to manufac-
ture yet another first-round 
upset. This is unbelievable. 
Not since the U.S. Olympic 
hockey team's "Miracle on 
Ice" in 1980 has a fledgling, 
underdog squad done so much 
with so little. Calgary would 
be onJy the ninth team in NHL 
history to lose the first two 
games at bome and come back 
to win the series - if they 
indeed do so. And they 
probably won't. 

A more likely scenario is 
that the Sharks will sink their 
teeth a little further into their 
prey upon returning to the 
Shark Tank in San Jose. 
Calgary, the Roy Scheider 
(he's the leading man in 
"Jaws, " for all you movie 
illiterates out there) of the 
hockey world, went out on the 
open seas in search of the big 
fish in a mere row boat. Unless 
the Flames get several lucky 
shots, their season will be 
eaten alive. 

I'm certainly not complain-
ing about this rehashing of a 
Cinderella story. After all, if 
ti,e playoffs went as expected, 
what would be the fun in 
watching them? 

REPEAT: The Triton 
women's tennis team 
advances to the semi's 

Staff Writer 
As the UCSD women 's tennis 

team entered the 1 ()q5 Division III 
Women's Tennis Championships in 
Sweet Briar, Virginia, expectations 

for the team were 
high. 

After all, Head 
Coach Liz 
LaPlante ' s rack-
eteers are the defend-
ing National Cham-
pions, as well as the 
owners of a stellar 

14-2 regular-season record. 
After two days of tennis, the field 

of 14 teams has been whittled down 
to four, and t he Tritons still remain 
poised to win their fifth national 
championship in the school's short 
history. 

The defense of the national title 
officially began on Tuesday, when 
the Tritons squared off against 
Luther College of Iowa in the first 
round. 

Because UCSD was slighted a 
bit by a fourth seed, they were not 
able to enjoy a first-round bye like 
the top two seeds. But this shouldn't 
put the Tritons at a disadvantage if 
they continue to playas they have 
been of late. 

laPlante and company continue 
to closely follow the game plan of 
the regular sea-
son: dominating 
in doubles and 
then ultimately 
clinching the win 
in singles. 

Luther's pairs 
were simply 
overmatched by 
their San Diego 
counterparts who 
swept all three 
doubles contests 
in nail-biting 
fashion. 

Of course, it 
helps that 
UCSD's top-
ranked combo of 
Suzy Drage and 
Miki Kurokawa 
is peaking. The 
duo notched an 
impressive 
down-to-the-
wire 9-7 triumph 
over Dana 
Johnson and 

Michele M .......... klll w_ eIrectIv. at number-one for the Tritons, INcline UCSD to the ........ 
the rest of laPlante's powerful 
lineup. 

The number-two team of 
Michelle 
Malephansakul 
and Yumi 
Takemoto also 
impressed all, 
burying Erika 
Schmitt and 
Sara Anderson 
to the tune of 
an 8-5 victory. 

Morgan 
Gessford and 
Hilary Somers, 
the anchors of 
the doubles

match was far enough along to be 
offICially complete, and the Tritons 
clinched the victory. 

It was far from easy, though. 
Malephansakul, UCSD's top-ranked 
singles player, found herself behind 
from the start against the hard-hit-
ting Johnson, who won the first set 
by a lopsided, 6-1 tally. 
Malephansakul played as ifshe were 
possessed in the second set, how-
ever, snatching the 6-4 win. The 
momentum carried her through into 
the third, where she slammed the 
door shut, 6-2. 

The clinching win came from 
number-two Drage, who produced 
some late-set heroics of her own, 
strongly ousting West, 6-7,6-4,6-3. 

In yesterday's quarterfinals, the 
Tritons were pitted agai nst Gustavus 
Adolphus College, who had eeked 
past Williams College the previous 
day, 5-4. UCSD halted the Gusties ' 
run by a 6-3 score. 

tinued their strong doubles play, 
giving Lisa Broughten and Sarah 
Lobland the boot, 8-6. 

In comparison, Gessford and 
Somers enjoyed an easy malch, 
breezing to an 8-3 conquest to round 
out the sweep. 

As a result of its doubles domi-
nance, UCSD needed only two wins 
in singles to clinch Ihe victory. The 
Tritonswentoneover, winning three 
of the solo matches. 

Malephansakul again led the 
charge, posting a 6-1, 4-6, 6-3 de-
feat of Han to stay undefeated in the 
tournament. 

Somers stomped Broughten, 6-
4, 6-2, and Kurokawa vanquished 
Lobland, 6-3, 6-2, to round out the 
Triton scoring. 

Drage faltered at the number-
two hole, where she fell to Erickson, 
7-5,6-1, to even her win-loss record 
in singles during the tournament at 
1-1. In fact, imagine a sporting

Band which once played 
keg parties finds itself on 

major label 
When the bip-hop/metal band Sugar 

Ray started playing fraternity parties in 
San Diego and surf parties in Newport 
Beach, singer Mark McGrath said he 
didn't expect to end up with a rerord on 
a major label. Yet Atlantic Records . 
released Sugar Ray's debut, Lemonade 

and Brownies, a few weeks ago. 
"We started playing keg parties for surf-

ers and that was the extent of what any of us 
expected to do," McGrath said during a recent 
phone interview from his home in Los Ange-
les. "The band kept snowballing. It would 
reach a peak, then level off, and then reach 
another peak. Ourpopularity never went down. 
We were happy playing our Judas Priest, 
Damned, fuck -around covers in front of a keg 
for a bunch of drunk idiots. That was enough 
for us." 

Mixing metal, punk, hip-hop and R&B, 
Sugar Ray, which also includes guitarist 
Rodney Sheppard, bassist Murphy Karges 
and drummer Stan Frazier, plays with the 
intensity for which The Beastie Boys have 
become famous. The band also uses samples 
provided by House of Pain's OJ Lethal, who 
also served as the album's executive pro-
'ducer. 
"Most bands say, 'we like all kinds of music,' 
but I think we are the one band that proves that 

types of music and respect each other's tastes. 
I'm the R&B guy in the group. 
"There's no style we won't play," he added. 
"If someone came up with a country, two-step 
jamboree thing, we'd try it." 

The band also expresses its sense of humor 
onLemonadeandBrownies. With songs titled 
"Danzig Needs a Hug" and an album cover 
which features a naked woman crouched on 
her hands and knees, Sugar Ray doesn't take 
itself too seriously. 

"Our record is very tongue-in-cheek. It's 
something you can put on at partieS and listen 
to. It's not going to change anybody's world. 
It's just a fun thing," McGrath said. "I'm not 
going to compare it to [The Beastie Boys'] 
License to Ill, but it's kind of similar, some-
thing you can put on and groove to." 

Band members now share a house in Los 
Angeles, and McGrath said the arrangement 
actually contributes to the band's creativity. 

"We're all living in one house in LA right 
now, and it gets kind of crazy," McGrath said. 
"It's kind of a springboard for the 
psychophrenic, sonic assault which turned 
into this album. 

"It's pretty scumy. There are some guys 
who are just pigs. Some days are clean and 
other days it looks Like a war. Murphy's room 
is a pig sty at all times, he throws burritos at the 
wall."

on record," McGrath said. "There's 
not one track on our record that sounds 
the same. That was deliberate. We set 
out to do that. We all like different

THE 1995 CALIFORNIA COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION 
TRACK & FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS 

Not just anyone can host the CCAA Track 
and Field Championships. UCSD has been 
granted a rare opportunity this weekend - a 
chance to play host to its conference's biggest 
event of the year and, at the same time, a chance 
to mark this event as its own . 

"We hosted this two years ago as part of a 
rotation, so it was really not our tum yet," Tri-
ton Hcad Coach Tony Salerno said. "We were 
not supposed to have it this year ... 

But due to original host Pomona Pitzer's sub-
standard track, UCSD will present the CCAA's 

anyway. The sparkling, well-kept facilities on 
the northern part of campus will be trod over 
and raced upon by 190 athletes from four Divi-
sion II conference schools - Cal State-Los An-
geles, UC Riverside, Cal Poly Pomona and Cal 
State-Bakersfield. 

"Home field will be a tremendous advan-
tage," Salerno said. "But this is the toughest 
Division II conference in the country. If we fin-
isb in third place, we'll be happy." 

Indeed, Cal State-L.A. and Cal State-Bakers-
field will be toting their big guns with seem-

ingly sub-second times, and the top-weighted 
scoring system will certainly hurt the deep Tri-
ton talent pool. 

However, UCSD has a few racehorses of its 
own - a near record number of NCAA quali-
fiers; multi-event stars like Michele Domico, 
EmestClark, Renee Sprowl and Randy Buehler; 
aod,the familiarity of friendly surroundings. 

WitMall this in their favor, the Triton 
trachlc .. do have a chance to make an impact 
this weekend. After all, unexpected things can 
happen ",hen you're defending your home turf.

By Chl.un Simmons 
Staff Writer 

French Kiss, the latest film by 
acclaimed director Lawrence Kasdan 
(Body Heal, Grand Canyon), is just 
another romantic bit of fluff. 

Meg Ryan stars as Kate (Meg 
Ryan), whose seemingly safe, al-
though boring life is suddenly ruined 
when her fiance, Charlie (Timothy 
HuHon), takes off to Paris 
and falls in love witha French 
beauty. Kate decides to fight 
her fear of flying and goes to 
Paris. On the flight, Kate 
meets Luc (Kevin Kline), a 
French crook with a tender 
heart, who, after planting 
smuggled goods in Kate's 
baggage, must follow herevery move.

Luc (Kevin Kine) ..... K.ta (Mea Ryan) In .-.ta. 
comedic roles previously demon-
strated in A Fish Called WalUUl and I 

Love You To Death, once 
again steals the show. Luc is 
portrayed with just enough 
kitsch and heart to make the 
audience love him, despite 
his obvious flaws. Kline's 
comedic talent is often over-
looked because of his dra-
matic roles in films such as 

The Big Chill and Sophie 's Choice. In 
Kiss, Kline shows that he is one of the 

most versatile and talented actors in 
Hollywood. 

Meg Ryan fans will be happy to 
see that, once again, "the queen of 
comedy" resorts to her usual routines 
to get a few laughs. Ryan has been 
successful with herileurotic,girl-next-
door appeal in earlier films; however, 
in Kiss, this charm becomes formu-
laic, since we've seen it acted out in 
similar fashion again and again. 

French Kiss is showing at theaters 
throughout San Diego.

Helium 
Singer Mary Timony finds 

inspiration in death and dirt 
arM ....... 
Hiatus Editor 

Although several songs on 
Helium's latest album, 77Ie Dirt of 
Lucl, make references to death and 

.., "dirt," it would be a mistake to call it 
a "ooncept album." Rather, as voc:al-
ist-guitarist Mary Timony said during 
a phone interview, the song topics and 
melaphorsare merely things that came 
to mind when she was writ-
ing. 

"The references to dirt 
are hard to explain," said 
Timony, who counts au-
thors such as Margaret 
Atwood and Sandra 
Cisneros among her favor-
ites. "A lot of people have 

Shawn DevIiD and his brother, bassist 
Brian DevIiD. The band released its 
debut, the EP Pirate Prude last year, 
which featured repeated references to 
vampires, a theme Timony said she 
has since abandoned. 

"It [the vampire] symbolized this 
evil force which was sucking the life 
out of me and turning me into a mon-
ster too," Timony, who has described 

Helium as "cartoon music 
meets monster music," said. 
"" is how I felt at the time. I 
guess the vampire would be 
the symbol for the other per-
son in an unhealthy relation-
ship, but I definitely dropped 
that one."

but joking about it I don't really mean 
it in a way. Women are also seen as 
this fertile, earthy, creative thing, like 
Mother Earth. In that way, the dirt is

all. " 

"The songs just evolved differ-
ently. WiththeEP,aIIthesonp,from 
playing them live so many times, be-

they started out," Timony said. "With

comparisons are somewhat limiting. 
Timony doesn't sing with the same

view, but our music is completely dif-

her a lot, but she has a completely

She's more into raw emotion and real 

anger. I 'm not capable of doing that.

songs are more rational and less

between Helium and PJ Harvey. 80th

write about female sexuality. yet the

The Englisbman 
Who Went 
Up A Hill ... 

Hugh Grant stars in 
charming Welsh tale 

By Cr.I. Stold. 
Staff Writer 

news: FfynnonGarw 
is only 985 feet tall. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Cluistopher Monger's The English-
man Who WentUpaHil~ButCame 
Down a Mountain explains itself in 
its title, or does it? The title reveals 
the plot of the story, but there is 
more to a film than knowing what 
will happen next The question is 

It is a hill. The vil- · H..... O.....t ....,. • IMd swveyOl' In n.. 
lagers take action ~. 

how will it happen? 
The year is 1917, and two 
English surveyors (Hugh 
Grant and Ian McNeice) 
are traveling through 
~ Wales, measuring the el-

evations of the local land-
scape for His Majesty's 
Ordinance Survey. In the 
village of Ffynnon Garw 
the locals have much pride in a moun-
tain which shares the village 's name. 
The locals know that it may not be 
the tallest mountain in Wales, but 
they are confident that it is the first 
mountain, since it is so close to the 
Welsh-English border. However, the 
surveyors reveal to the village that a 
summit must be over 1 ,000 feet to be 
considered a mountain. HeMing this, 
the villagers remain steadfast that 

___ their beloved Ffynnon Garw is a 
mountain, and couldn't possibiy be 
a hiU. The surveyors return with bad 

and set out to raise 
the height, by adding earth at the 
"hill's" summit. 

This film does not have a weaving 
plot of murder and manipulation, 

though some scheming and 
deception arises. The English-
man reveals the charm of the 
Welsh, their sense of humor 
and the way a village works 
together to get something 
done. 

Christopher Monger, who 
wrote the screenplay, does us 
a great favor by sharing his 

grandfather's tale, passed down three 
generations. 

Witty and lovable characters,such 
as Morgan the Goat (Colm Meany~ 
the local bar-owner whose dark beer 
is as well known as his randiness; the 
local church reverend (Kenneth 
Griffith), who is prone to sermons of 
the dramatic-pause nature; and the 
two simpleton twins named lbomas 
Twp and Thomas Twp, Too (Tudor 
and Hugh Vaughn) make the film 
appealing. 

always have the momentum for 
which one would hope. The dia-
logue always delivers a witty 
punchline in each scene, but makes 
for a wobbly foundation. 

The film's strengtm lie in the 
charm of the village and the warm 
feeling of a community working to 
meet a goal. The cast is wonderful 
- even the supporting characters 
stand out. Thomas the Trains 
(Howell Evans) is perfect as the eye-
bulging train conductor, who 
puckishly prevents Grant .nd 
McNeice from leaving. Tara 
Fitzgerald as Betty of Cardiff is per-
fect as the sassy woman who keeps 
Hugh Grant's attention while the 
village goes about its mischievous 
deeds. 

In spite of the The Englishman's 
appeal, it isn't a standout film. How-
ever, it does manage to portray the 
warm harmony of village life, some-
thing seldom seen in movies today.

IN 8A:J TASTE 

The Far Side ofClnis Elliott 
By Mike Mrinez 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

avis Elliott is fearless. He shares 
a certain bravery with early Steve 
Martin and the late Andy Kaufman-
that is, he's noI afraid to be not fuMY. 

Hope I didn't break some double 
negative rule there. 

It's safe to say that Chris Elliott is 
ready and willing to work, to visibly 
labor with material that he and every-
one else knows is going nowhere. But 
"nowhere" is the intended destina-
tion. 

The absence of the joke is the joke. 
Like Martin's deadpan banjo bal-

lads, or Kaufman's lip syncing of the 
"Mighty Mouse" theme, Elliott can 
beat the most obscure premise to death 
for an audience that doesn't even re-
alize there's been a murder. His hu-
mor is braille for the deaf. 

So why is he out there? In the last 
decade or so he has made numerous 
appearances on mentor David 
Letterman's shows, starred in his own 
cable specials and a 1V sitcom, writ-
ten a spoof on Mommie Dearest, 
starred in a feature film (Cabin Boy) 
and is now a regular cast member on 
"Saturday Night Live." 

Who (besides Letterman) gets 
Chris Elliott? 

I find him irresistible, yet I can't 
pin down his appeal. His basic per-
sona is distinctly non-endearing-
that of a rather droll fop, spewing 
snide one-liners for his ears only. The 
other inhabitants of his world don't 
usually get it, and neither do we. At 
best, he's merely a harmless, gentle 
misfit like the character he played in 
the Fox sitcom Get A Life. 

Yet he can also grate, like the 
office boor or the smart-ass kid you 
want to swat across the room. I-Je's 
most tolerable in short bursts, where 
he can shine as an absurd counter-
point to the rest of the story. He's 
definitely not up to carrying a whole 
feature-length movie. 

Consequently, he's not essential 
to the best moments in Cabin Boy, an 
in-joke-to-himself which might be 
described as "Sinbad the Sailor meets 
Felix Unger." More laughs are to be 
had from the phony miniatures and 
the tacky, oversize props than any-
thing Elliott does. 

Cabin Boy's belated attention as 
shtick on the Letterman-hosted Oscar 
telecast was the quintessential Elliot 
triumph. Its discordant presence in a 
program honoring the best films of 
the year is one of his most sublime 
jabs at the conventions of show busi-
ness. 

Like Cabin Boy, Chris Elliot's 
humor is like an impressionist paint-
ing - funny moments and asides 
tossed to and fro, with no thought to 
setting up the joke or delivering the 
payoff. 

His lengthier works are like Gary 
Larson collections, panels of nonsense • 
strung together that neither follow the 
last nor precede the ri1=xt. 

He's the cow at the wheel, the 
sissy Hun, the amoeba in the easy 
chair. His ultimate triumph is also the 
craziest juxtaposition of all-getting 
tu tell stories of Chris Elliott in the real 
world. 

And Elliott keeps working, all the 
while having the biggest laugh of all 
-a career.
