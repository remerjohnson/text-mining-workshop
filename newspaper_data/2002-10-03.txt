UCSD music professor 
receives 'genius' award 
George Lewis earns $500,000 for 
prestigious MacArthur Fellowship 

By JUN MA 
Staff writer 

UCSD professor of music 
George Lewis received the presti-
gious MacArthur Fellowship on 
Sept. 25. 

The MacArthur Fellowship, 
awarded by the John D. and 
Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation, provides the recipient 
with a $500,000 "no strings 
attached" grant that may be freely 
used. The purpose of the 
MacArthur Fellowship is to invest 
in the person's insight and poten-
tial, as well as to foster their cre-
ativity for the benefit of society. 

Since its creation in 1981 , 635 
fellows have been named for the so-
called "genius award." The profes-
sor, an improvisational trombonist 
and composer, is one of 24 winners 
this year whose creativity and orig-
inality is honored by the organiza-

tion. 
"For the 

longest time, the 
question was not 
if George Lewis 
would receive 
this award, but 
when he would 
receive it," said

for Lewis on Sept. 30. "The music 
department is extremely thrilled 
that George has won." 

Lewis, who joined the UCSD 
faculty in 1991, co-founded the 
department of music's critical stud-
ies/experimental practices program 
in 1996. The program emphasizes

labor unions 

march for better 
wages, security 

By THOMAS NEELEY 
Associate News Editor 

The Coalition of Union 
Employees, the University 
Professional and Technical 
Employees, and the University 
Council! American Federation of 
Teachers all staged a rally on Oct. 2 
tv make public their labor griev-
ances against the University of 
California and UCSD. 

The three groups, which com-
bined to number about 100 inui-
viduals, marched from the Price 
Center to the Chancellor's 
Complex via Library Walk. 
Demonstrators shouted, carried 
signs and rattled cans filled with 
coins. 

The rally had a minimal effcct 
on university operations. Most stu-
dents watched the rally as they 
passed the group on Library Walk; 
some students participated in the 
rally as a sign of solidarity with the 
muons.

By LAURA MCGANN 
Associate News Editor 

The Che Cafe Collective is 
currently under investigation by 
campus officials due to a possi-
ble violation of federal law for 
providing technical support to a 
foreign terrorist organization. 

A non-UCSD -affiliated 
complaintent from the East 
Coast, whose name is not being 
disclosed by the Office of 
Student Policy and Judicial 
Affairs, alleges that the Che-
maintained Web site, 
http://burn.ucsd.tdu, is providing 
support for the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia . 
The FARC has been labeled a 
Designated Foreign Terrorist 
Organization by"the U.S. State 
Department. 

In a letter to the Che Cafe 
Collective signed by Director of 
the University Centers Gary 
Ratcliff, the collective was 
informed that it is in violation of 
UCSD policies as well as 
Federal law for "using UCSD 
computer network resources to 
provide access to a terrorist 
organization." The letter from 
Ratcliff stated that the "links 
supporting the FARC" violate a 
portion of the USA Patriot Act. 

Members of the CM Cafe 
Collective responded to the let-
ter from Ratcliff, stating that 
they believed the administration 
had violated the "Memorandum 
of Understanding" between 
UCSD and the Associated 
Students, the Graduate Student

BRIEFLY 
Deadline to waive USHIP 

fee approaching 
Undergraduates have until Oct. 4 to 

waive the Undergraduate Student Health 
Insurance Plan. Those who successfully 
waive the fee for Fall will not be assessed 
the $181 fee. 

Beginning In fall 2001, the University of 
California required health insurance of all 
registered students. Those without health 
Insurance or those with a plan that does 
not meet the UC requirements will be 
assessed the quarterly fee. 

Students who miss the deadline or do 
not meet the minimum requirements will 
have another opportunity to waive the 
USHIP fee at the beginning of winter quar-
ter. Successfully waiving the USH IP for the 
fall also exempts students for the 2002-
2003 academic year. 

The requirements and online waiver are 
available via the World Wide Web at 
http'//studentJink.ucsd.edu. 

Professor's contributions 
pave way for new chip 
Intel Corporation has unveiled the 

world's first microprocessor with hyper-
threading. a new technology partially devel-
oped by UCSD professor Dean Tullsen that 
allows chips to process almost twice as 
much information as a normal micro-
processor. 

Tullsen, a computer science and engi-
neering professor, holds the patent for a 
technology: that many in the industry feel 
was crUCial in the commercial adoption of 
hyper-threading. He began his work on the 
patent in the mid-1990s while at the 
University of Washington. 

Hyper-threading is Intel's label for what 
Tullsen calls 'simultaneous multithreading~ 
SMT is based on the concept that threads, 
or streams of programs and applications 
that a processor delivers, are executed all at 
once, essentially causing one processor to 
act as many. . 

Intel believes hyper-threading can 
improve utilization of CPU resources by 
about 40 percent. For now, Intel is the only 
chip maker using hyper-threading. 

As co-director of UCSD's processor 
architecture and compilation lab, Tullsen is 
working on SMT improvements to other 
computing components, such as operating 
systems and compilers.

Biophysics center created at UCSD 
Grant awarded by National Science Foundation 

By CARLAN WENDLER 
Staff Writer 

UCSD, and a cohort of local 
institutions, recently received a 
$10.5 million grant from the 
National Science Foundation for 
the purpose of creating a Center 
for Theoretical Biological Physics. 
While no new lab space will be 
created for biologists and physi-
cistS interested in mathematically 
modeling biochemical phenome-
na, this initiative will facilitate col-
laboration among these diverse 
fields. 

The grant is one of the seven 
major grants the NSF awarded to 
research institutions this year. 
UCSD took three others, making 
it - in conjunction with The Salk 
Institute, The Scripps Research 
Institute and the San Diego 
Supercomputing Center - the 
leading recipient of NSF physics 
funding this year. 

The principal investigators 
involved in soliciting the NSF 
grant were UCSD physics profes-
sors Jose Onuchic and Herbert 
Levine, as well as TSRl biophysics 
professor Charles Brooks m, all of 
whom will co-direct the center. 

As far as the immediate impact 
of the funding on research at 
UCSD, it should coax researchers 
to collaborate more than generate 
new projectS. 

"The center does have some 
specific research projects to 'get 
things going; but most people I 
talk to thinlt the excitement comes 
from having a large visitor pro-

gram, outreach in the form of 
courses and conferences and in 
bringing to~ether people who are 
interested In a wide variety of 
problems," said David Case, a 
molecular biologist at TSRl who 
will be involved In the center. "By 
providing a stimulating environ-
ment and a flexible approach, I 
expect the crBP to be devoted to 
a much larger extent than most 
projects in new venues of 

" What is significant in this 
research, as in much of 

modem scientific 
research, is the 

collaboration itself. 
- Paul Tooby , San Dieao 

SUpercomputer 
research." 

It remains to be seen how the 
introduction of this new center 
will affect undergraduates and cur-
rent researchers in the .Iong run. 
"The overall collaboration that 
SDSC will be part of will be new 
applications and extensions of 
ongoing research, rather than 
completely new lines of 
[research] ," said Paul Tooby, a 
senior writer for SDSC. 

"What is significant in this 
research, as in much of modem 
scientific research, is the coil abo-

ration itself." 
Participants in the crBP pro-

ject are excited about the possibil-
ities the new center presents for 
the world of scientific research. 

"What this does is mark the 
coming together of work in two 
scientific areas that have not had 
ijoint] facilities; it recognizes and 
emerging field," said Keith 
McKeown of TSRl. 

Biophysics is a burgeoning 
field and is expected to become an 
increasingly important part of sci-
entific inquiry into the molecular 
biology and physics world. The 
questions scientists seek to answer 
in this field pertain to the mathe-
matical modeling of biological 
events, activities or pathways. 

An example one researcher 
gave of how the grant can be used 
for interdisciplinary study includes 
using computer-based visualiza-
tion tools to illustrate and under-
stand the 50 proteins and numer-
ous RNA molecules of the ribo-
some more completely. 

Other research will be done on 
the level of the whole cell or even 
population dynamics - a task 
made easier by the .proximity to 
the SDSC. 

Numerous UCSD professors 
are slated to be involved with this 
project, including physicists 
Henry Abarbanel, Terrance Hwa, 
David Kleinfeld and Wouter-Jan 
Rappel, as well as biochemistry 
professors l(jm Baldridge, J. 
Andrew McCammon and Peter 
Wolynes.

Policy review 
process bumpy, 

but well resolved 
I n response to systemwide changes to the student records policy by the UC Office of the President, UCSD 
Director of Student Policy and Judicial 
Affairs Nicholas S. Aguilar made significant 
changes to UCSD's policy over the summer. 

The problem wim Aguilar's enthusiasm for 
the revisions was mat he failed to gather input 
from students in the revision process. 
However, Aguilar demonstrated flexibility in 
his willingness to consider AS. Council input 
once its views were articulated this month. 

The Guardian would like to applaud 
Aguilar for complying with or compromis-
ing on most of the significant points with 
which the A.S. Council was concerned. He 
made complete reversals on the major 
points of the appeals process and the avail-
ability of student photos on StudentLink. 

However, it cannot go overlooked that 
Aguilar initially proceeded without input 
from me students on an issue that directly 
affects us all. He justified himself by saying 
mat he was trying to revise the Policy and 
Procedure Manual 160-2 quickly to comply 
with UC-wide changes. He also said that the 
language needed for the revisions was too 
technical for students. But that does not mean 
that students could not have had input on the 
matter, not needing to write the text, but 
merely advise Aguilar on their position. 

The Guardian would also like to applaud 
the AS. Council for quickly reacting to the 
matter and assuring a student opinion in the 
revisions. The council's quick action got 
reversals on the appeals process and student 
photos, which are key campus issues con-
cerning students' rights. 

It is hoped that situations like this can be 
avoided in the future by allowing a student 
voice from the beginning in all things con-
cerning students. Given the circumstances, 
both the administration and the A.S. 
Council acted appropriately to work out a 
compromise.

Democrats lack moral certitude, 
consistency in deliberation over Iraq 

Many who once supported action against 
Hussein have changed mind for political reasons 

~ DUmN FREUCH 
Contributing Writer 

The old adage, "When your oppo-
nents are destroying themselves, let 
them," has a lot to do with the current 
debate over whether to go into Iraq. 

The ones destroying themselves thls 
time around are congressional 
Democrats. Why? They supported Bill 
Clinton four years ago when talk of war 
with Iraq was brewing, but not today. 
With time having passed and political 
tensions becoming much more 
strained, wouldn't Saddam Hussein be 
even more of a threat to the free world? 
If you ask them - no. 

All this talk of war has pacifists com-
ing out of the woodwork in opposition 
to the current administration, but 
President George W Bush is not waver-
ing. He\; following a moral compass of 
absolutism, wanting to do what is right, 
not what's political. The pacifists are 
clamoring for more time, but how much 
more time do they thlnk we can afford 
to give? Are they blatantly ignoring the 
fact that Hussein has already had over 
10 years to get his act together? 

One man who's certainly not playing 
poli tics is Bush. The core premise of 
his foreign policy is that evil must be 
stopped. Hussein embodies evil; he's a 
horrid dictator who has waged war 
against his own people. (Remember the 
Kurds in tht' north and Shiites in the 
south?) 

To understand the moral clarity of 
Bush, we must look at th e moral obscu-
rity of the opposition. In September, 
former President Clinton explained his 
current position on Iraq: 

"Saddam Hussein didn't kill 3,100 
people on Sept. II . 0 ama bin Laden 
did. And as far as we know, he's sti ll 
alive. We might do more good for 
America's security in the short run and 
at a far less cost by beefing up our 
efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan and 

, 

_.4"",---

NATIONAL 
elsewhere to flush out the entire net-
work and to find him .... We're already 
kind of changing the subject here, look-
ing at Saddam Hussein, who's not going 
anywhere." 

Everyone's entitled to his opinion, 
but what happens when someone gross-
ly contradicts himself? Let's go back 
and see what Clinton said in 1998, 
speaking about the potential threat 
Hussein posed: 

"What if Saddarn Hussein fails to 
comply? We f.iil to act or we take some 
ambiguous third route, which gives him 
yet more opportunities to develop his 
program of weapons of mass destruction 
and continue to press for the release of 
sanctions and ignore the commitments 
he's made . ... If we fail to respond today, 
Saddam and all those who would follow 
in his footsteps will be emboldened 
tomorrow. The stakes could not be high-
er. Some way, some way, I guarantee you 
he'll use the arsenal." 

So why the fl ip-flop from Clinton? It 
should be clear: It's politics, down and 
dirty. Anything to malr.e Bush loolr. bad is 
good; never mind that the security of the 
American people is at stake. Now the 
Democrats' apprehension about voting 
for a war resolution before November 

elections is starting to make sense. 
Joining Clinton in attacking the pres-

ident, Senate Majority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-S.D., said on the Senate 
8001' last week, "We ought not to politi-
cize this war. We ought not to politicize 
the rhetoric about life and death." 

How can Daschle say that with a 
straight face? Since the debate about war 
began, Daschle has been politicizing the 
issue, holding up a vote in the Senate 
that would give the president the power 
to oust Hussein for almost a month now. 

Apparently, he feels that Democrats 
can't vote their real feelings with elec-
tions imminent. But if they're so wor-
ried about how they'll come across to 
the American people through voting -
where, I might add, there's no spin -
they should be. They're not consider-
ing our best interests, just theirs. 
Reelection and power trumps the good 
of the nation once again. 

Also in step with the Clinton doc-
trine of appeasement, former Vice 
President AI Gore's Sept. 23 speech in 
San Francisco is not surprisingly full of 
contradictions itself. He started by say-
ing, "I believe we should focus our 
efforts first and foremost again.,t those 
who attacked us on Sept. 11 and have 
thus far gotten away with it." 

But he then stumbled over that idea 
when he later said, "Iraq does pose a 
serious threat to the sta bility of the 
Persian Gulf." 

Going one further, he also added, 
"We are perfectly capable of staying the 
course in our war against Osama bin 
Laden and his terrorist network, while 
simultaneously taking those steps nec-
essary to build an international coali-
tion to join us in taking on Sad dam 
Hussein in a timely fashion." 

Gore first says we shouldn 't redirect 
our attention to Iraq, then says Iraq 
poses a threat, and then, changing his

Che 'terrorism' controversy raises free speech issues 
horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

U niversity Centers D irector Gary Ratcliff thrust UCSD into the national 
spotlight last Wednesday when his 
letter to the Web site administra-
tors of BURN! and the Che Cafe, 
their online host, made waves at 
bttp:llwww.ncws.com and online 
nerd watering hole 
Imp:117JIlJTW. J/ashdol. org. 

According to bU77wesd.edu, the 
le tter states that "the Che Cafe is 
in violation of UCSD policies and 
Federal law by maintailling the 
burn.uesd.tdll Web site and using 
UCSD computer network 
resources to provide access to a 
terrorist organization ." Although 
the Che site itself has relatively 
mild anarchist propaganda, Mr. 
Ratcliff's letter asserts that "the 
b1lrn.acsd.edlt Web si te includes 
links supporting the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Columbia, an 
organization li sted by the U.S . 
Department of State as a designat-
ed foreign terrorist organization." 

Apparently, under the newly 
enacted USA Patriot Act, provid-
ing "communications equipment" 
is tantamount to providing mater-
ial support to terrorists. And by 
violating Federal law, Mr. Ratcliff 
argues, the Che is violating UCSD 
policy and the universi ty has the 
prerogative to demand the 
removal of the hyperlink. 

The Che, quite predict.1 bly, is 
resisting all attempts from the 
UCSD administration to stem the 
unstoppable tide of leftist activi ty on 

thls campus (no doubt the adminis-
tration fears an October revolution 
is at hand) and is refusing to comply. 
From the looks of a flyer published 
by the Che, its main defense seelns 
to be that there is nothing criminal 
about a hyperlink. As sensible as this 
may seem, under U .S. legal prece-
dent, unfortunately, it is wrong. 

In 2001, longtime hacker maga-
zine 2600 lost a long legal battle to 
major motion picture companies 
that wanted the publi cation to 
remove a link to a program, DeCSS, 
which could crack DVD encryption 
and thus was illegal under the 
D igital Millennium Copyright Act. 
Whi le 2600 had posted the original 
program before and had been nailed 
for it, the U.S. Second Court of 
Appeals decided that linking to 
other sites with the program was 
tantamount to committing the same 
crime. As a result, if the FARC Web 
site provides support to any "terror-
ist" (which it could in any number of 
ways; for example, disseminating the 
lates t political tract agai nst the 
Colombian government to FARe 
members overseas makes it a com-
munication tool), then 
bll77l.l1esd.edll's link is cri minal as 
well. 

While the Che has predictably 
been demonizing the administra-
tion and Mr. Ratcliff for their 
actions, perhaps it should be thank-
ing them; it appears the university 
has followed current policy and 
Federal law. And by pressing the 
matter, they've given the CM a 
chance to actually effect useful 
change in court (as opposed to rant-
ing mindlessly about Wliversity gnr-
d.ming sheds intruding upon the 
fertile groWlds of the revolution). 

The fact that hyperlinks and, 
for that matter, electronic da ta like 
computer programs and Web sites 
are not protected as free speech is 

an egregious flouting of the First 
Amendment. And the university's 
actions have shown , much more 
clearly than the DeCSS case has, 
the consequences of a society in 
which different standards are 
applied to electronic as opposed to 
written communication. 

For example, here is the text 
Ratcliff objected to, in its entirety: 

<II href= 
''http://1J)1J)1J) fare -rp. arg "> 
http://1J)1J)1J) fllre-ep. arg <Ill> 
Have I just committed a feder-

al crime? 
Or how about a couple more: 
<II hrei; 
''http://cubicmtttrcrystal.eomidus 

sldecss.zip">DeCSS<la> 
<II hl·tf= 
"http://www·pflp -pal.org''>The 

Popular From for the Liberation of 
Palmine<la> 

So do we dismiss the value of 
pointing UCSD students from 
UCSD Web servers to sites that are 
"terrorist organizations"? Does the 
rhetoric t1ut these organizations 
espouse have no redeeming acade-
mic value? Are sntdents so blind as 
to be unable to analyze terrorist 
manifestos at an academic level to 
Wlderstand the motivations of their 
writers as opposed to taking them 
as complete pedagogy? And is elec-
tronic publication a "tool for ter-
rorism," above and beyond speech 
protected by the First Amendment, 
and thus criminal? 

Mr. Ratcliff seems to believe so. 
Ironically, it seems his actions 

have only given the opposition a 
shining example of a case where 
the current legal system fails to 
address the more complex issues at 
hand, and provides the impetus for 
.change beyond the paltry con-
straints of Genesee and Torrey 
Pines Avenues.

however, Director of Student 
Policy and Judicial Affairs Nick 
Aguilar now maintains that the 
original letter about the hyperlink 
is no longer valid . Rather, h e now 
argues the Che is providing sup-
port to terrorists by hosting a Web 
page for FARC. 

The page, found at 
http://burn.1Icsd.edul-fare-epl, reads 
in totality, "La pagina de las FARC 
ha cambiado." The page - noth-
ing more than a link itself, essen-
tially - persists for five seconds 
before loadi ng http://1J)1J)1J)fare-
ep.org. This, Aguilar says, amoWlts 
to "hosting terrorism." This is 
patently absurd; anyone who takes 
the time to look at the redirect page 
and the intent of the ori ginal letter 
will rea.lize Mr. Agui lar is belatedly 
turning tail from a patently unten-
able position while trying to main-
tain some semblance of dignity. 

Mr. Agui lar seems the likely 
candidate as the author of the let-
ter, in light of his evasive answers 
as to who actua lly is the author. 
He now says an "official" second 
"clarifying" letter is on its way 
about the redirect page. 

Ironically enough, Mr. 
Agui lar'S attempt to shield his 
uncovered rear has changed little, 
since the original argument 
remains legally valid. If the univer-
sity has identified a violation of 
federal law - namely, the hyper-
link - and refuses to shut it down, 
it is an accomplice in crime. Mr. 
Aguilar has but added one more 
misdeed to the administration's 
list: censorshi p.

While we should welcome any 
international help, we shouldn 't 
depend on the rest of the world for

that Gore, Daschle and the rest of 
their supporters endorse war only if 
the world does. If the act is right in 
and of itself, why do we need sup-
port? It's moral relativism once again. 

Objecting to Gore and the other 
Democratic dissenters, House 
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Tex., 
said on Sept. 27 that taking the case 
to the United Nations would put the 
national security of the American 
people in the hands of others.

6 NEW. THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

UC system pressured to 'Go Solar' 
Lobbying effort coincide with renewable energy bill 

By ROBERT SALONGA 
The Daily Bruin (UCLA) 

(UW1RE) LOS ANGELES 
- In a state often characterized 
bv the amount of su nshi1H! it 
r~ccives, students are trying 10 
parl;l)' these rays inw providing 
energy to a substantia l amount of 
the University of California. 

The UC Go olar campaign 
Ius made Its wa), ro UCLA, with 
orgamzcrs and students currently 
garnering support fro l11 student 
governments systemwide to make 
ali new buildings in the University 
of California powered largely by 
renewable reso urces - namely, 
olar power. 

"California has to transfer ro 
clean energy," said Byron Kahr, a 
field organizer for the Go Solar 
campaign. "We're hoping the UC 
system wi li become a worldwide 
leader in the effort." 

Specifically, the campaign aims 
to have all new buildings in the 
university system installed with 
solar panels capable of generating 
2 S percent of a building's power, 
with an additional 2S percent com-
ing from renewable energy sources 
such as wind or hydraulic power. 

On Sept. 24, Kahr presented 
the campaign to the 
Undergraduate Stu,dents 
Association Council to ask for 
UCLA's support on the student 
government side. 

UCLA External Vice President 

Chris Neal said the campaign i 
well -timed "since [the University 
of California] is doing so much 
building." 

"If this is cost-effective, then 
it's an advantageous th ing to do," 
Neal said. 

According to early esti mates, 
Kahr said the costs would be mar-
ginal ro the university when con-
sidering the decrease in harm to 
the environment. 

Parts of UCLA have been uti -
lizing solar power for more than a 
decade, wi th solar panels on top of 
the high-rise residential halls on 
tlle Hill. Dykstra, Hedrick, Rieber 
and Sproul Halls all have rooftop 
panels accounting for a minimum 
of 40 percent of the buildings' hot 
water, according to Michael 
Foraker, director of housing. 

The campaign comes at a time 
when the University of California 
is building its tenth campus at 
Merced. Kahr said a critical piece 
of the Go Solar effort is the UC 
Merced campus, and if the cam-
paign is successful, it would 
become the first campus to power 
itself largely by renewable energy. 

These efforts to move the UC 
away from oil-based energy also 
coincides wi th a landmark bill 
signed by Gov. Gray Davis in 
September. By signing Senate Bill 
1038, Davis mandated that retail-
ers of electricity in the state must 
increase their use of renewable 
sources by one percent pet year 

anclmllst be comprised of 20 per-
cent renewable energy by 20 17. 

T he effect on the environment 
would be the equivalent of taking 
3.3 million ca rs off California 
roads, said Erin Walsh, a UCLA 
campus coordinator for CaIPIRG, 
the student lobbying group that 
helped propose Senate Bill 1038. 

California's electricity is cur-
rently made up of 12 percent 
renewable energy, said Steve 
M avigli o, a press aide for the gov-
ernor. 

Davis' office hopes the new 
stand ards will decrease 
California's dependence on natur-
al gas and increase the use of wind, 
geothermal, biomass and solar 
resources. 

Pacific Gas and Electric Co., 
one of me state's largest energy 
suppliers and which once had an 
energy monopoly in California 
prior to the utility deregulation of 
the late 1990s, supports the gover-
nor's bill and expects to meet the 
20 percent goal six years ahead of 
schedule in 20 II . 

PG&E currently matches the 
state average of renewable source 
usage at 12 percent, and is already 
increasing its use at one percent 
each year, said Brian Swanson, a 
press aide for PG&E. 

Swanson added that the compa-
ny has signed long-term contracts 
with renewable energy generators, 
including a large number of hydro-
electric plants.

Kimberly Hughes/Guardian 

Speaking up: A union supporter shares her experiences as a UCSD employee 
with fellow demonstrators at the Oct. 2 labor rally on Library Walk. 

Labor: Supporters marched 
on chancellor's complex 

continued from page z 
versity rather than particulars of the 
negotiated contracts. 

Eric Paavola, a clinical lab spe-
cialist at the Student Healm Center, 
is the president of me CWA 911 9 
chapter of UPTE. 

UPTE represents approxi mately 
1,000 researchers and technicians, 
including staff research associates, 
animal technicians, c1inicallaborato-
ry technicians, psychologists, phar-
macists, communications technicians 
and academic computing technicians 
atUCSD. 

Currently, researchers and tech-
nicians hold different contracts at 
UCSD. Researchers have been with-
out a contract since June 30, and 
teclmicians si nce Sept. 4. Bargaining 
has been going on since last May. 
UPTE wants to negotiate for one 
contract between the two groups. 

egotiating a contract is impor-
tant for tllese workers, Paavola said, 
clue to the nearly 30 percent 
turnover rate each year. 

"We're just a training grOlmd for 
pnvate industry," he said. "People 

. move on to bigger jobs." 
UPTE believes that UCSD is not 

bargaining fairly. Paavola alleges that 
me university is using regressive bar-
gaining tactics, where offers are 
made by the university and later 
rescinded. 

Paavola feels that \vith the unions 
beginning to act in accordance with 
one another, their ability to negoti-
ate with the U niversity of California 
will increase. 

"The university is having to deal 
\vim unions in a whole different light 
now that we're becoming more 
orga nized," Paavola said. 

e. U .E., which represents clerical 
workers at UCSD, wants higher 
wages and accused the University of 
California of "bargaining in bad 
faith." A5 of press time, C.U.E. had 
not returned phone calls made by 
the Guardiall to its San Diego 
offices. 

The Oct. 2 rally was a local man-
ifcstation of labor issues being raised 
by university unions up and down 
the UC system, particularly with 
regard to UC lecturers. 

In August, C.U.E . and AfT 
union members at UC Berkeley 
staged a three-day. strike that coin-
cided with the first week of classes. 
Some classes being taught by strik-
ing lecturers were canceled for tile 
duration of the strike. 

The Los Allgeier TImes reported 
on the growing unrest oflecturers in 
a Sept. 30 article. T he article cited 
the growing number of classes lec-
turers were expected to teach, as well 
as the salary gap between lecturers 
and tenured professors as reasons for 
the strife. 

The article also reported that 
two-day walkouts by lecturers are 
planned for O ct. 14 and I S at UC 
River ide, UC Santa Cruz, UC 
Davis and UCSD, although unions 
repre enting groups at UCSD told 
the Gllardia71 tlley were unable to 
say definitively if thcir chapters 

were planning to stage a walk-ollt 
at UCSD. 

Fred Lonidier is a professor of 
visual arts and the president of the 
University Council/AFT Loca l 
2034, the union representing lectur-
ers at UCSD. Like UPTE, he feels 
mat the University of California has 
not bargained to me best of its abili-
ty. 

"The main grievance for all mese 
wuons is me University of California 
is not bargaining in good faith, " 
Lonidier said. "It makes it hard to 
bargain with them." 

One of Lonidier's union 's com-
plaints, similar to that of UPTE's, is 
mat UCSD labor negotiators are 
using regressive bargaining tactics. 

Lonidier said this practice consti-
tutes an wlfair labor practice and 
could be grounds for a strike. 

"The UC labor relations rea lly 
stink," Lonidier said. "Thevniv rs(-
ty is looking at major labor unrest 
from one end of it to the other." 

UCiAFT also believes tim the 
current system of hiring and releas-
ing lecturers is unfair. 

The University of California 
employs about 1,600 Iccturers sys-
temwide. Most lecturers are hired 
for an initial six-year probationary 
period. After this period, the univer-
si ty can choose whemer or not to 
offer the lecturer a three-year, 
renewable contract. 

The current system, Lonidier 
said, is inconsistent and not based on 
merit. 

"It!> very arbitrary," he said. 
Schwartz said what the 

University of Califomia is curren tly 
able to offer its leculrers is "among 
me best in the country." He nored 
that UC lecturers' three-year con-
tracts can be renewed regardles~ of 
whether the leculrer is part-time or 
full timc. 

"Our salaries are very COIllP~t.i ­
tive and, in some instances, are supe-
rior to lecturers at private California 
universities like Stanford and USC," 
Schwartz said. 

UC/AFT also wants to use a 
merit-based system for rehiring 
lecturers to provide more job secu-
rity. The current system has no 
accountability, according to 
UCiAFT. 

Schwartz said the position oflec-
rurer was never designed [0 be a per-
manent career position. 

Lonidier believes tim giving lec-
turers more job securi ty will foster 
more academic freedom, as it does 
for tenured professors. 

"[Tenure's] purpose is for acade-
mic freedom," he said of tenured 
professors. "They're now worthy to 
have an unpopular opinion." 

Addressi ng concerns that leculr-
ers are only looking Ollt for meir 
own interests and not those of tile 
student body, Lonidier feels that the 
demands made by the lecturers will 
also benefit students. 

"We believe we can make tile C;lse 
that undeq,rraduate teaching -31 be 
better," Lonidier said .

their effects on human societies. 

"Lewis' work as an artist and 
scholar, bam in academia and the 
artistic world beyond the walls, is 
extraordinary," Fonville said. "It 
richly merits me recognition and 
prestige of the MacArthur 
Fellowship." 

For Lewis, the fellowship rep-
resents the culmination of over 
three decades of work devoted to 
the exploration of new music and 
creative improvisation as an inter-
disciplinary field . 

"I think that for me, this has 
been amazing," Lewis said. "This 
award is a vindication of what 
we've done, and it will give recog-

nition and awareness to our musi-
cal community." 

Lewis ' career expands into per-
formance, where he has docu-
mented over 120 recordings. He 
has mastered the various qualities 
of me trombone and his composi-
tions cross over traditional bound-
ary lines of music. 

As a pioneer in me application 
of computers, music and improvi-
sation, Lewis created Voyager, a 
computer music program that uses 
algorithms and live musicians to 
improvise notes on a piano. 

For his award plans, Lewis 
hopes to use his prize money to 
further his worlc as a musician and 
teacher of experimental music, 
including me development of 

larger projects with interactive 
computer media . 

"I'm not quitting my job," 
Lewis said, "but I 'd lilce to take 
some time off to finish my book 
on the Association for the 
Advancement of Creative 
Musicians, one of the most influ-
ential experimental music move-
ments of the past quarter-centu-
ry." 

He also hopes the award will 
give greater visibility to the criti-
cal studies/experimental practices 
program at UCSD. 

"This award will help us 
. develop our form of creativity 

here," Lewis said. "It's all about 
UCSD as a window to the world 
for our form of music ...

Only students with meal plans

those sold on OLE!.

year when Housing . nd Dining

groceries, had 5,200 customers last 
year - an increase of 50 percent 
over the previous year. An extension 
to the Earl's Place building was built 
in the past few months to accommo-
date pickups for OLE! 

OLE! was not designed specifi-
cally to pacify on-campus apartment 
dweUers, Weinreich said. 

"[The service] is something mat 
had been talked about for a long 
time, and not tied to the 'One-rate'

The service will help Housing

THURSDAY, OCTOBER J, 2002 

Many of us may remember having imagi-nary friends as children, but good grief, they were never as screwed up as the 
ones portrayed in "Imaginary Friends," now 
playing at the Globe Theatre. 

This new play with music (careful there, 
it's not a musical) writren by Nora Ephron, 
("When Harry Met Sally," "Sleepless in 
Seattlej traverses through an imaginary rela-
tionship between 20th century writers Lillian 
Hellman and Mary McCarthy. Although they 
hardly knew one another, that minor detail 
didn't stop them from hating each otller. 

To understand the premise of the play, one 
needs to understand the history and context of 
the authors. Hellman was a celebrated wit who 
wrote such plays as "The Children's Hour" 
and her famous memoir "Pentimento." 

McCarthy (Cherry Jones) and Hellman 
(Swoosie Kurtz) detested one another until 
the day they each died. Literally. 

Both werc prominent figures in the liter-
ary, socia l and political worlds they circulated 
in . Shocking stories, plays, nove.ls and tem-
pers made them famous to the public and to 
each other. 

Sharing their opposing views, each publicly 
criticized the other from before World War I 
until the late I 980s, when they both died. 

So this play takes these two legendary -
and now nearly forgotten - figures and 
places them head to head in a dramatic and 
comedic play that traces their lives and poli-
tics when they meet in Hell. 

Ridiculous? It sounds like it would be at 
first. but the idea works - for the most part. 
In no other medium could this have been

only those odd intermittent musical numbers 
could have just tied in a little bit better. 
Because they were sometimes a bit far-reach-
ing (imagine twO men resembling singers 
from a barbershop quartet claiming to be 
"Fact" and "Fiction" and then dueling it out 
by tap dancing and singing) and extravagant, 
they detracted from the play, which would 
have been funny even without these scenes. 

Besides the little musical diversions, 
Ephron's script retold the history of the women 
and the politics of the time remarkably weU. 
The ever-changing costumes were consistently 
historically accurate, while Kurtz and Jones 
both played their respective roles perfectly. 

Kurtz was ideal as the cynical and some-
times stoic Hellman. All of her sultriness and 
wicked humor oozed from her with ease, but 
she could turn around and playa Southern 6-
year-old claiming to be "the sweetest 
smelling baby in New Orleans" just as easily. 

McCarthy was a much more serious person 
in life, and Jones portrayed her as a troubled 
yet strong and brilliant woman. Although she 
had a beautiful voice and easy manner, Jones 
could in 110 way compete with the demanding 
stage presence of her counterpart, Kurtz. 

In addition, Harry Groener was hilarious 
as every male character in the pl3y. He was 
dangerously creepy as McCarthy's abusive 
uncle, yet he was also incredibly funny as the 
drunken Dasheill Hammett. 

Although some of the musical numbers 
were simply puzzling, many of them added to 
the play immcnsely. The humorous and flir-
tatious number with the 19305 bartenders 
helped create an atmosphere that could not 

llchieved otherwise. And just 1$

important, the song introducing the 
McCarthy trials was as serious and dramatic 
as the other was comic. 

Each of these sets up an ambiance that 
becomes integral to the scenes that follow, 
whether they are humorous or tragic. 
Incredibly, the play manages to be both, 
which is no easy feat. 

The imaginative use of different mediums 
like projections and puppets were innovative 
and helped in producing a setting and added 
humor where needed. 

Ultimately, the play aptly represents the 
two intellectual women. Even those who 
have never heard of them or don't give a rat's 
tushie about some dead broads will inevitably 
find themselves intrigued . . Perhaps the most 
touching moment comes at the very end 
when the stage is lit up with a montage of ail 
their works, making Hellman and McCarthy 
even more relevant and undying. 

So if you're still wondering whether to see 
it or not, by all means do, bccause it is a great 
play, although unbelievably strange at times. 
But it stiil manages to stay enterta ining with 
a great amount of wit and humor throughout 
the entire three hours. 

"Imaginary Friends" is playing at the Globe 
Theatre in Bal boa Park before it goes to 
Broadway, so check it out while it's here. The 
play is running from now through Nov. 3. 
Tickets range from $25 to $45 with discounts 
for students, seniors and active military. For 
information and show times, call (619) 239-
3355.

think about how far away you are 
from a break. 

At least there is an upside; the 
fantabulous student governmcnt 
that you all know and love - and 
never make fun of - has got some-
dling to look for.vard to: a quarter-
ly music event. Let's see, tllis is fall 
quarter, so then, FallFesr: Exacrly. 

Due to prolongued contract 
negotiations, the identitic wcrc 
not divulged to tlle hiarus sta ff 
until recently. Ncvcrthclc s, the 
Associate Students fesilval taff 
proudl y announces that 
Blackalicious, MxPx and Jurassic 5 
will be rocking the RlMAC Arena 
stage on Oct. II . 

While the former two groups 
seem like the most congruous of 
the three performers, there is 
nonetheless an over-arching posi-
tive vibe toward all the bands. 
Both J5 and Blackalicious are 
known for their alternative sonic 
approach to hip-hop, along with 
breaking with the West 
Coasu"Gangsta" rap tradition . 
They have chosen to move away 
from lyrics about gritty urban 
realism and the accompanying vio-
lence and misogyny that this mar-
ketable formula entails. Rather, 
both of these California grou ps 
have found solace not in huge 
financial success, but rathcr in 
making music that is cri ticaily 
acclaimed for composition and 
intelligent word play. 

Maki ng a different sort of 
impression altogether is MxPx, 
whose name was originally 
Magnified Plaid (apparently it gOt 
changcd because of a demo mishap 
- don 't ask), playing Christian 
Punk of all things. Despite being 
relatively successfu l in thc pop 
scene, where being too much of 
anything, even religious, can spell 
certain doom, MxPx have managed 
to exist counter to groups like Blink-
182; not swearing at dle audience, 
and not even asking girls to remove 
clothing. The elf-proclaimed 
"good guys" mixed DrY cthics for 
ycars - well ... at least the high 
school years - before slowly break-
ing their way into the cene. 

So what do we, the random anci 
ometimes drunken UCSD ~ru­

dent. have in store? Good times, 
come FallFest.

All the mayhem of the Sick and 
Twisted Festival of Animation 

It may look like a children's cartoon, but your 5-year-old 
would be tormented by nightmares of maimed critters 

By RINALDO DORMAN 
Hiatus Editor 

At first glance, one might think this is going to be a very boring DVD: cute, cuddly and downright friendly. "Happy 
Tree Friends" looks like it's something 

out of the child-orientated Golden Book 
series, And then I looked closer; the subtitle 
isn't "fun for all" or "caring is sharing," but 
"Volume #1, First Blood," 

OK, so that's not your typical children's 
style, and neither are the cartoons, which 
make it a point to offer up as much pain and 
animated suffering as one could possibly jam 
into a short. 

The whole design of the series, which has 
several cartoons playing at this year's Sick 
and Twisted Festival of Animation, is going 
for sickly sweet, Somewhere between 
Teletubbies and other benign children's car-
toons in terms of sheer cuteness, each char-
acter is a fuzzy little woodland animal. Be it 
Petunia, the air freshener slrunk, or Handy, 
the armless handy-beaver, they are all twist-
ed, but loveable, 

If there was any amount of confusion 
about what kind of cartoons these are, then 
simply viewing the first of the 14 "heart-
burning episodes in Happy Color" would 
prove that some disturbed individuals came 
up with this, Despite its innocuous begin-
ning, three quarters of the characters are 
soon grue~omely killed by the desire to be 
spun faster on a merry-go-round. 

The use of the DVD's capabilities is done 
well, with 14 episodes (mostly three to four 
minutes each) and ironically punctuated pub-
lic service announcements like: don't forget 
to floss, there are four "smoochies" to "play 

@f------R--=EV~-=-=-= 
with" (which are nothing less then your 
opportunity to take a stab - no pun intend-
ed - at the torture of smaJ.l, smiling, cute 
creatures), The simple games are reminis-
cent of the flash animations, such 3.S a frog in 
a blender or a hamster in a microwave. 
Candy-holic "Nutty" gives you the oppornl-
nity to kill off the squirrel with over doses of 
sugar. 

The other eXtras include the now-obliga-
tory artist/director commentary that never 
finds much to interest this reviewer, but 
beyond that, there is also a discussion and art 
display of the creation process. There is also 
a fun-fact section, where each of the charac-
ters is given a bizarre biography and a per-
sonality that would make your mother cringe 
should she walk in on you. Irreverance is 
mixed with soul crushing depression as 
Shifty, we are told, has crippling emotional 
problems. 

If it's any consolation to you, the look of 
abstract horror that is likely spreading across 
your face is absolutely called for. Trust me.

Let yourself be 'Spirited Away' 
Director's fantastic vision brings a new dimension to 

anime, with close attention to detail and a worthy plot 
By CHARUE TRAN 

Senior StaH Writer 

Dorothy walking down that yellow brick road evokes a certain childhood memory that yearns for escape from reality, When 
Alice tumbles down into Wonderland, the idea 
of being whisked away into a fantasy landscape 
becomes magical. Visions of fantasy and 
enchanonent are conjured up in acclaimed 
director Hayao Miyazakis "Spirited Away," 
which is only matched on screen by the likes of 
"The Wizard of Oz," 

For those unaware of his creative genus, 
Miyazaki is world-renowned as one of the 
masters of Japanese anime with a masterful 
eye in creati ng visually-breathtaking land-
scapes with a painstaki ng attention to detail 
that would blow away even some of today's 
CGI-enhanced counterparts, Some of 
Miyazakis acclaimed works include " Princess 
Mononoke" and "My Neighbor Totoro." 

Witl1 a sharp eye to details and focus, the 
colors from Miyazaki's backdrops ooze with 
glee and joy, From the detailed marble lines 
of a spirit bathhouse tile to the surreal, 
impressionist view of a train gliding across 
the sea, cinema has never saturated the eyes 
with such a fanciful escape from reality. 

The adventure begins when lO-year-old 
Chihiro (voice by Daveigh Chase) moves to a 
new home, leaving her many friends and good 
times behind. Like many children of her agl', 

hihiro is somewhat spoiled and distant from 
her parents, Chihiro's fatller makes a wrong 
turn on the way to their new residence and 
winds up on an isolated road that leads to what 
he calls an "abandoned amusement park." 

Enticed by the smell of food, Chihiro's 
parents greedily snack on food tha t has been 
left out, Unbeknownst to them, tile place is 
actually an enchanted land full of spirits, 
dragons and witches, The gluttony exhibit-
ed by the parents turns them literally into 
pigs. Chihiro must now discover the cause of

all the enchantment and must find a way to 
turn her parents back into humans. 

Guiding her along this path of self-dis-
covery and wonderment is Haku (voice by 
Jason Marsden), who is uncertain of his own 
identity. Haku is not a mere mortal - he is 
also a dragon and just one of the many fanci-
ful characters in the mystical land that 
Chihiro finds herself in. 

VVhen it comes to inspiration and creativ-
ity, Miyazaki shows that he is the master of 
his domain. From spell-enchanted balls of 
SOot that follow the direction of a six-armed 
man to fighting paper birds to a giant-like 
baby that is turned into a mouse/hamster 
hybrid, "Spirited Away" showcases an eclec-
tic mixture of imagination found only in 
places like the minds of Lewis, Tolkien and 
Baum, 

Chihiro's journey is not only limited to 
the attention spans of children, but also to 
those of college students and adults. Adult 
themes of isolation and seclusion are abun-
dant throughout the film. 

Those familiar with Miyazaki's works will 
be happy to see that he still has that magical 
touch, For those who have yet to embrace or 
seen anime, "Spirited Away" is a good way to 
escape from the world and enter tha t place 
over the rainbow.

Beck's n inth full -length 

album begs the question: Is 
rock 's truest one-man band 
getting soft with age? While 
this album does not fall off 
sharply from the progression 
of his previous albums, this 
album does lack the one rock 
track that most of his previous 
albums have offered.

T he String Cheese Incident, 

a jam band that expertly mixes 
bluegrass, rock and funk wi th 
hints of calypso and lati n beats,

Luka Bop Records 

**** 
"Espirituvivo" is an intri-

ca tely crafted lesson in lan-
guage, history, and culture that 
is shorter than the average lec -
ture. 

Baca, a Peruvian si nger of 
African descent, proves that 
emotion can break down any 
language barrier. H er cool, vel-
vety voice commands the car to 
listen to her. 

The lyrics tell the stories of 

scene in 1994 with the hit single 
" Loser " from his album 
"Mellow Gold," Beck has yet to 
be forgotten by an audience 
with an anention span shoner 
than most of Beck's albums. 

While the popular media 's 
fascination with Beck has been 
maintained over the years, not 
much of its attention has been 
spent on Beck's musical outings. 
With a catalog of over 500 
songs, this alleged genius has 
maintained his place in rhe 
world of rock by maintaining 
the originality that his first sin-
gle made so obvious. 

His new album is critically 
acclaimed and is already being 
called Grammy-worthy. T he 
press has taken to the idea that 
this release, along with the new 
Red Hot Chili Peppers album, 
is going to sti r a new revol ution 
of soft albums from the world of 
rock. 

"Sea Change" has melan-
cholic tones throughout the 
albllm. As Beck mumbles over 
ever-changing guitar melody 
with light percussion and sym-

ings of their shows in triple-
album format through thei r 
Web site, and these polished 
releases are a testament to their 
live talent. 

Whi le T he String Cheese 
Incident's studio recordings 
have gained them a solid fan-
base th roughout the country, 
the band 's sound comes alive 
on stage, where simple and 
upbeat ~ongs progress into 
jams often lasting over 15 min-
ures . 

This, however, doesn't inter-
fere with one's enjoyment of the 
songs, which never get boring 
thanks to layers of insrrumen rs 
- the quintet plays the electric 
mandoli n, the djembc, the vio-
lin, the conga , the organ and 
the Rhodes accordion, all 
alongside the more traditional 
guitars, bass and drums. 

The expe rimental "On the 
Road" recordi ng project, in 
the vein of Pearl jam's frenetic 
series of live re leases, encom-
passed al most every String 
Cheese live date (better known 

slavery and the li fe of Peruvian 
peasants. T he vocal sound 
conveys the struggle and cul-
ture of the peasants . The 
result: you don't have to break 
out your Spanish-English dic-
tionary to rea lize that Baca 
means business when she 
sings. T he Peruvian culture is 
alive in her voice. 

Baca is a native of the black 
coasta l barrio of Chorri llos, 
outside Li ma, Peru. She weaves 
her cu lture's traditions, songs, 
dance and rhythms into 
sparkling songs tllat document 
Peruvian history 

Baca and her band spend a 
half-yea r on the coast outside of 
Lima to create the album. The 
six people lived in a house, jok-
ing, singing and playing music 
together endl essly. It's like 
"Real World Peru," except the 
group managed to accomplish 
something. 

The results the perfection of 
a studio recorded album with-
out sterili ty - Baca and the 
band hel d jam session to 
ensure that the spontaneity of 
the music remained . 

phonic overtones, he sounds at 
times like the bastard child of 
T hom Yorke and Eddie Vedder. 

While it probably intention-
ally lacks a true single, ' the 
album's gem is "Lost Cause," 
which is the culmination of 
everything that Beck does well 
on the album. 

The soft percussion , whis-
pering voice and guitar is over-
laid with a hint of rock's new 
techno edge in a song that 
comes off as folksy. The lyrical 
genius that accompanies the 
music is what sets Beck apart 
from his imitators. 

The rest of the al bum's 
songs are slow ballads that deal 
with the idea of being adrift in 
the ocean of life. These ideas 
are best summed up in "Golden 
Age" and "These days I barely 
get by, I don't even try." A sur-
prisi ngly stark album, "Sea 
Change" is at moments as bril -
lia nt as the bright pink disk that 
it plays on.

Refusing to sign to a major 
label, the band has gone from 
playing for free slci-lift tickets in 
their home town of Boulder, 
Col., to setting up their own 
recording company, online tick-
et service and even a travel 
agency catering to their fans . 
T his latest strategy can only 
help them gain a larger fanbase, 
since their live recordings are 
polished and hint at the band's 
fabulous stage presence. 

The band's reputation pre-
cedes them, and rans o f jam

The String Cheese Incident is 
a band worth seeing live. Bu r

Bal i dancing 
troop Cudamani 
to take stage 

UCSD graced by inter-
national preservation 

of heritage and culture 
By JESSICA LONG 

Staff Writer 

During their years of academic life at UCSD, most students will rarely come ac ross men-
tion of Bali. However, o n Oct. 4 
students will get the chance to see 
firsthand the sights and sou nds of 
the country, thanks to Cudamani . 

Cudamani is a group of 25 
musicians and dancers ranging frolll 
ages 8 to 33. This group was 
founded in the 1970s in the small 
village of Pengsekan in Ubud, Bali , 
to preserve and cultivate the cultur-
al and artistic life of their village. 

Cudamani has four main objec-
tives to achieve through their work. 
The first: pass on classical music and 
dance pieces from the old masters to 
the younger generations. The sec-
ond: assist in the development of 
new creative projects by young 
composers and choreographers.The 
third : educate the children of the 
vi1lages in their native forms of 
music and dance. Fourth: support 
the spiritual life of the villages in 
Bali by offering their musicians and 
dancers for ritual ceremonies. 

For the first time, Cudamani 
has a chance to bring their talent to 
those outside of Bali. This is their 
first international tour, and their 
program will include a variety of 
works ranging from treasured clas-
sics to newly-created compositions. 
The main goal of the group is to 
educate others about their art and 
culture. 

Judi Griffith of the University 
Events Office believes that this will 
be a valuable event for students to 
attend. She believes that this per-
formance will be a "unique experi-
ence for the students of UCSD." 
Griffith said this performance 
could be of "particular interest ro 
the Asian students on cam pus , 
especially those whose families are 
from Bali, as this would be a won-
derful chance to experience their 
culture." However, she stresses that 
this is a wonderful chance for a1l 
students to "broaden their knowl-
edge of other cultures." 

Cudamani will be performing in 
the Mandeville Auditorium on Oct. 
4 at 7:30 p.m . Tickets are $20 for 
general admission, $15 for students 
and $18 for UCSD faculty/staff 
and senior citizens. Tickets can be 
purchased at the UCSD box office 
or by calling (858) 534-TIXS.

'Five for Five': Perfect 
ten for new productions 
Excellent opportunity for UCSD students to 
enjoy a variety of theatrical performances 

By MARA EVANS 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

There are some ski lls all col-lege students must have to survive their years of higher 
learning. One of these is the abil-
ity to get top-quality entertain-
lIlent for the lowest possible price. 

For the fourth consecutive sea-
son, the UCSD Theatre and 
Dance Deparonent is giving 
UCSD students an opportunity to 
hone their spendthrift skills by 
offering an opportunity to enjoy 
fine theater at a rock-bottom price. 

Created four years ago by 
Department Chair WaltJones, the 
"Five for Five" program allows 
students to buy one pass for $5 
that will gain them admittance to 
five main stage productions that 
take place from November 
through May. Regular s tudent 
prices are $6 per production. 

"Walt Jones wanted to lIlake 
sure that every student on campus 
had an opportunity to get 
acquainted to really fine theater," 
said Caroline Passeneau, prolllo-
tions manager for the theatre and 
dance department. "It's been a big 
success." 

Unbeknownst to m any, 
UCSD's graduate theater program 
is ranked third in the nation. This 
prt:stigious ranking comes frOIll 
high caliber productions like the 
on es in the upcoming 2002-2003 
season. 

"The program introduces our 

" t j, I li~ 
, ' " 

plays to students who would not 
normally take advantage of 
them ," said Erin Sposato, a work-
study student who regu larly 
attends productions. 

"Five for Five" members will 
be able to enjoy the upcoming 
" Morning Becomes Electra," 
which is directed by UCSD stu-
dent Suzanne Agins . The 
grandeur of this first production 
will be echoed throughout the rest 
of the year with such stage perfor-
mances as "Angels in America: 
Millennium Approaches," "The 
Two Gentlemen of Verona," "An 
Evening of Dance" and the hilari-
ous "Stage Door." 

"'Five for Five' is rewarding for 
all the actors as well," explained 
Patti Harp, management services 
officer of the depamnent. 

Harp explained that a large 
audience is also an important part 
of the training for stage managers, 
designers and directors who gain 
experience through the audiences' 
reactions to the production. 

"The purpose of ' Five for Five' 
[is I to expose students on campus 
to theater and get them addicted," 
Harp said . 

UCSD students who are inter-
ested in taking part in the cama-
rader ie of UCSD theater and 
dance productions through "Five 
for Five" should visit the theatre 
and dance department on the 
south side of G albraitll I [all with

Front row:

After 30 y~ars, Title IX issue still unresolved 
Law against gender discrimination continues to stir debate 

continued from page 20 
Steve Urkel than Steve Young? Maybe 
you're trying to live out your dreams 
through real athletes." 

Nope, I was never a superstar ath-
lete in high school , but I won my fair 
share of team and individual league 
championships. I don't write to live 
vicariously through the athletes at 
UCSD. I love playing sports, but I use 
intramurals to take care of that urge, 
not writing. 

"What's left, then?" you ask. "Do 
you write ro attract the ladies?" 

As glorious as it is to have my head 
shot at the top of each of my colulTUls, 
I'm going to have to say no to that. Its 
not that I don 't wish some sweet, beau-
tiful, intelligent. funny girl is out there 
reading this colulTUl and waiting to 
introduce herself to me. It's that I don't 
think it's possible. Out of the five of you 
reading this, three are guys, one is my 
mom, and my fifth reader already has a 
boyfriend. While it would be a nice 
perk, I don 't think that my colulTUl 
increases my sex appeal all that much . 

"Is it some kind of power trip?" you 
wonder. "Do you get a kick out of hav-
ing your name in print and having 
people read all your thoughts'" 

Good guess, but the only person I 
know who can do something important 
when only five people are listening to 
him is Los Angeles Laker head coach 
Phil Jackson. And if two of my five were 
Shaq and Kobe, I could do a lot bigger 
things, too - Zen master or not. 

"I don't get it," you say. "All this 
time talking, and you still haven't told 
me why you write for the Guardian." 

You 're right. 
But I just financed my next two 

bottles of Gatorade. 

By JEREMY TWntHELL 
The Daily Universe rBYUj 

(U-WIRE) Provo, UTAH -
After 30 years of existence, Title 

IX, the law that prohibits gender 
discrimination in collegiate pro-
grams, is again the subject of a 
national debate. 

A commission appointed by 
the U .S. Department of 
Education is leading the debate in 
a series of meetings across the 
country to discuss the law's future . 

The goal of the four meetings, 
held from August to November of 
this year in various cities, is to 
prepare a recommendation to 
Rod Paige, the U.S. Secretary of 
Education, about how the law 
should be implemented in the 
near future. The second meeting 
was held last week in Chicago, 
and the third conference is sched-
uled for Oct. 22 to Oct. 23 in 
Colorado Springs, Colo. 

Paige formed the Secretary's 
Commission on Oppornmity in 
Athletics in July of this year in 
response to a lawsuit filed by the 
National Wrestling Coaches' 
Association in January. The law-
suit alleges that Title IX, which 
requires universities and colleges 
to provide equal athletic opportu-
nities to members of both sexes, 
has caused many schools to cut 
men's programs to achieve com-
pliance. 

"We completely embrace Title 
IX as it was originally written, to 
prohibit gender discrimination in 
federally funded schools," said 
Mike Moyer, the executive direc-
tor of the National Wrestling 
Coaches' Association. "What 
we're specifically challenging is 

the Department of Education's 
interpretation in 1996. They've 
taken an otherwise great law and 
turned it into a quota system." 

Moyer was referring to pro-
portionality, which is one of the 
three ways that an institution can 
comply with the requirements of 
Title IX. The proportionality 
requirement mandates that a 
school provide 
equal athletic 

" 

to meet the needs of the current 
student body. 

However, according to 
Moyer, proportionality has 
become the measuring stick that 
is used to measure compliance 
with the other two regulations, 
and therefore is the onJy "safe 
harbor" that schools can depend 
on. 

"It's hard to 

opportunities for 
members of both 
genders propor-
tional to the 
school's overall 

We completely 
embrace TItle IX 

believe that propor-
tionality has made 
it this far," Moyer 
said. "You won't 
find this in any 
other are3 of soci-
ety or campus." enrollment num-

bers. Therefore, if 
the student body 
of a university con-
sists of 60 percent 
female, then 60 
percent of the 
school's athletic 
programs should 
be organized for 
women. 

"We're specifi-
cally challenging 
the proportionality 
requirement," 
Moyer said . "You 
cannot measure 
athletic interest 
from enrollment 
numbers." 

The law pro-
vides twO other 
ways that schools 
can comply with 

as it was arginally 
written I to prohibit 
gender discrimina, 

tion in federally 
funded scoo15, " 
- Mike Myer, 
executive direc-

toroft~ 
National 
Wrestling 
Coach's 

Association 

Proportionality 
may be convenient, 
but it doesn't with-
stand scrutiny. The 
one-size-fi ts-all 
proportionality test 
doesn't work. " 

Donna Lopiano, 
the executive direc-
tor of the Women's 
Sports Foundation 
in New York, 
agrees that propor-
tionality provides a 
safe harbor, but dis-
agrees on the inter-
pretation of that 
term. 

"Proportionality 
is the standard 
starting place for 
any anti-discrimi-
nation law," 

Title IX, either by 
demonstrating a history of work-
ing to expand opportunities for 
the underrepresented gender or 
by proving that the school's cur-
rent athletic teams are sufficient 

Lopiano said. "If a 
group represents the general pop-
ulation, no one will allege dis-
crimination. It's a safe harbor; no 
one can tell you you're discrimi-
nating if you comply with it."

Lopiano also said those who 
filed the lawsuit are not really 
trying to overturn the propor-
tionality part of the compliance 
test, but they are rather trying to 
add a fourth part, an interest sur-
vey. 

This would allow schools to 
conduct opinion polls of the atti-
tudes of men and women toward 
sports and their desire to partici-
pate, and then base team numbers 
and sizes on those results . 
However, Lopiano says that is not 
an accurate test. 

"Interest surveys measure am-
tudes, not behaviors," Lopiano 
said. She also pointed out that 
American culture constantly 
encourages boys to play sports, 
and on the rare occasions that the 
same is done for girls, their inter-
est level is just as high as any 
boy's. 

"The real issue is, how can we 
provide nondiscriminatory sports 
opportunities for all?" Lopiano 
said. "Then, the question 
becomes, 'How can we fund all of 
this?'" 

According to Lopiano, most 
schools would be completely 
willing to offer any sports team 
to any gender, but are financially 
unable to do so. If a way could be 
found to improve funding, she 
said, Title IX would not be a big 
issue. 

Although both sides have 
many of their own ideas for 
improving the current system of 
Title IX enforcement, the com-
mission is far from an official 
conclusion. There are still two 
meetings left and the official rec-
ommendation is not due until 
Jan. 31,2003.

Triton soccer reserve receives honors 
Treankler named player of the week for Sept. 16-22 

ByANU KUMAR 
Sports Editor 

Women's soccer reserve forward 
Lindsey Treankler was named tile 
Brine California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Women's 
Soccer Player of the Week for the 
week of Sept. 16 to Sept. 22 . 

"My teammates were all really 
exci ted for me," Treankler said 
after hearing the announcement. "I 
was really excited, and my parents 
were really excited." 

During that week, Treankler pro-
vided UCSD with a spark corni ng 
off the bench, entering all three of 
the Trirons' games as a subsrimte. 
She scored four goals in UCSD~ vic-
tories over Grand Canyon, Sonoma 
State and San Francisco State. 

On her birthday, Sept. 17, 
Treankler scored twice on headers, 
leading Tritons to a 3-0 shutout at 
Grand Canyon. On Sept. 20, the 

forward, who was a red shin last 
se3son out of La Mesa, Calif., 
scored the game-winning goal 
aga inst Sonoma State in the 83rd 
minute of the game. 

To place the exclamation point 
on her week, Treankler helped seal 
the deal with the Tritons' second 
goal of tllcir 2 -0 win against San 
Francisco State. 

Tre311kler leads UCSD with four 
goals. The TritOns, now 6- l in the 
California Collegiate Athl etic 
Association and 7- 1 overall, will 
enjoy the enthusiasm that freshman 
Treankler brings off the bench. 

"I love coming off the bench," 
Trea nkler said. "r would like to 
start, but it's the coach's decision. r 
just try to make the most of it." 

TreankJer and her role as a sub-
stitute should prove to be a crucial 
point in UCSD's quest for a third-
straight Division II national cham-
pionship.

are thriving. While dominating 
the stat sheet, Jennie and Bonnie 
are also helping the Tritons pick 
up wins . The team has opened its 
season with a 10-3 start, despite 
injuries and a general lack of 
cohesion on offense . UCSD looks 
to repeat last year's trip to the 
Division II Final Four this season, 
admitting that lofty standard is 
something they aim for. 

"Every year, our team goal is to 
put ourselves in a position to win 
the national championship," Jennie 
said. 

With the two Wilsons playing 
together, that goal seems ve.ry pos-
sible this season. Jennie's rare tal-
ent as a middle blocker and 
Bonnie's defensive prowess give 
the Tritons two great all-around 
players. It is a testament to their 
ability that Jennie and Bonnie,S' 
II" and 6', respectively, lead 
UCSD in digs. 

While Jennie begrudges 

Bonnie's extra inch of height, the 
two are closer than the inch that 
separates them. 

"The relationship that we have 
is very different than that of any-
one on the court," Jennie said . 
"There's this comfort level that 
you get with very few other peo-
ple in your life where you know 
that there's no line that you can't 
cross ." 

That comfort level will 
undoubtedly be valuable when the 
Tritons look to accomplish big 
things this season. And with 
Jennie and her fellow upperclass-
men leading, Bonnie and the 
Fabulous Fives playing well, the 
freshmen contributing and the 
entire UCSD team coming 
together, this is not a team whose 
goals should be taken lightly. 
There's too much determination 
in these sisters' eyes. There's too 
much fire, too much passion and 
two Wilsons too many for any 
opponent to stop. 

tougher opponents. On Friday, 
they go to San Jose, Calif., to play 
East Coast power Princeton at 
Bellarmine Prep, a neutral site -
except for the fact that it's the 
alma mater of Triton sophomores 
Travi s Boettner and Kevin 
Smoker. 

On Saturday, UCSD travels a 
bit further north to Berkeley, 
Calif., to compete in the NorCal 
Tournamt:nt, which features many 
of the best teams in tile country. 
In thei r first ga m e 0 11 Saturday, 
UCSD draws a tough Pepperdine 
team. T he Waves beat No. 1-
ran ked Stanfo rd last weekend. 

To beat a team like Pepperdine 
and th e other top teams 3t th e 
NorCal Tournament, the Tritons 
will have to play at their own pace. 

"The way to beat teams this 
week is to work harder and counter 
harder," Ellis said . "Most of the 
teams we face this weekend are 
much more physical, and beating 
them in a slower-paced game isn't 
easy." 

UCSD will face Princeton at 3 
p.m . on Friday afternoon and will 
play in the NorCal Tournament all 
day on Saturday and Sund ay.

As I continue working on 
the job that has provided sever-
al bumps in the road for me, I'm 
not going to work around the 
surprises, but prepare for them 
as though I knew they were

shockers provide. 

Individually or as a team, as 
an athlete or a writer, there is 
no doubt that the finish will 
come after going through the 
obstacle course. But hopefully 
next time you can move on 
without stumbling and make a 
smoother run through the 
course.

WE'RE LOOKING FOR SIBLINGS 
IN A BRIEF HEALTH STUDY AT UCSD! 

~ UCSD researchers would like to meet siblings, for a brief study on how heredity influences blood pressure in healthy persons . . Siblings are brothers, sisters, or brothers and sislers; so, practically J everybody is a sibling and has siblings (brothers or sisters) . We are especially interested in sibling trios (J brothers or sisters in the same family). Because siblings share genes, siblings allow us to find 
out how heredity influences traits. We seek bolh male·male, female· 

female, and male·femal!! sibling groups. We seek siblings of either 
sex, age 18 or Older, and all ethnic groups or races. 

The study takes about 4f.l minutes, and includes measurement of 
.blood pressure and heart rate , as well as taking a blood and urine 
sample. We will provide monetary compensation for your time and 
travel. 

If you and your sibling would like to find out more about this 
study, please contact Lily Rao, at tel (858)'552.8585, extension 6158;

Anu Kumar 

R ecend y, I may have taken on a job without completely thinki ng it through. I prob-
abl y should howe seen the trouble 
coming, but r still ran ri ght into it 
as If I were driving th rough a da rk 
parking lot with lily headlights off. 

I've alway., been one whose opti -
nu slIl overshadows the possible set-
backs of every situation. It seems like 
I take on tasks with an expectation 
that they're going to go exactly a 
planned, and at the fi rtish I'll come 
out where I had planned to be. And 
it seems li ke in just about everything 
I do, I am quickJy slapped in the face 
wi th everything that I didn't expect. 

I would like to think that I'm 
not the only one who often faces 
such unpleasa nt surpri es. 
Profess ional athletes deal with 
unexpected obstacles, as well as 
members of Triton athl etic teams. 

With this being the first week of 
O ctOber, and Major League 
Baseball beginning its postseason, 
let's take a look at problems that big 
league teams face . My beloved but 
pathetic Dodge rs, for instance, 
held a four-and-a-half game lead 
ove r the scum o f the N ati onal 
League, the G iants, with only four 
weeks left in the season. Los 
Angeles manager Jim Tracy never 
seriously thought that hi starting 
pitchers, who tOgether made up 
one of the strongest ro tations 
through the first half of the season, 
woul d suddenly have trouble get-
ting Out of the first inning. 

Also, l hcy and the Dodgers 
probably wouldn 't have imagined 
that they would have to deal with 
the loss of rookie Kazuhisa Ishii, 
who was struck in the head by a line 
drive on Sept. 8, leaving the 
Dodgers without one of their solid 
~tarters. The team went into a piv-
otal point in its schedule without 
the personnel Tracy thought he 
would have, and the Dodgers lost 
thei r lead to rival San Francisco. 

After holding an all -but-promis-
ing lead in the race for the final play-
off spot in the National League, the 
Dodgers were hit by a giant surprise 
that a crystal ball wouldn't have 
helped to predict, and Los Angeles 
was left with a bitter taste in its 
mouth when Barry Bonds and the 
Giants clinched the Nl~ wild card. 

However, when you come to a 
bump in the road (as I have experi-
enced personally and observed as a 
sports fan) that seems to prove that 
only unluckiness exists, all you can 
do is hope that you don 't take it like 
a dropped Honda with no shocks. 

Now the Dodgers are going to be 
fo rced to sit and watch the Giants 
battle through the National League 
playoffs and wonder, what if? Now 
Los Angeles wonders how it would 
feel to still be playing baseball, while 
thinking about what it needs to do to 
impr ve for next season. 

N ext spring, teams that missed 
th playoffs, such as the Dodgers, 
wi ll be put to the test, and fans will 
ee if teams can respond to the 

challenge that falling flat on their 
faces stirs up. The Dodgers and 
others will have to answer to the 
challenge of recovering from the

UCSD recovers season at Santa Cruz 
Water polo wins all five games at its weekend tournament 

By OWEN MAIN 
Staff Writer 

T he UCS D men 's water polo 
team had a disa ppoi nting tourna-
ment at the Southern California 
Invitational on Sept. 14 and Sept. 
15, losing all four ga mes. During 
the fo ll owi ~g .two weeks, the team 
was on a miSSion. 

"Si nce we dropped all four 
games in the SoC al tournament, 
the team has worked very hard," 
said head coach Denny Harper. 

While there were no games 
schedul ed in the two weeks 
between tournament , the Tritons 
took the time to get re focused. 

U\ Ve worked Out so hard the 
past twO weeks," said senior driver 
Ke ll an Hori, who scored fo ur 
goa ls in the Tritons' 14-2 win over 
Santa C lara on Sept. 28. "We've 
been doing a lot of swimming and 
getting into good shape." 

The renewed UCSD work ethic 
showed las t weekend in Santa 
Cruz, Calif., at the UC Santa Cnlz 
Slugfest. The Tritons dominated 
the Slugfest against lower-ranked 
tea ms, winrting all five of the games 
they played by a combined score of 
76-14. The closest match came in a 
9-2 victory over Air Force. 

Guardian file photo 

Stay afloat: The Tritons, who went into last weekend's tournament at Santa Cruz with a record of 4-6, used a two-week 
layoff to prepare for the Slugfest. UCSD won all five of its games to pick up momentum for the last ha lf of its season. 

"We've been doing a lot of 
shooting in practice," said junior 

Matt Ellis, who netted five of the 
Tri tons' 20 goals against host team 
Santa Cruz. "It definitely paid 
off." 

UCSD also continued to show-
case its depth, subbing six players 

in and six players out for the entire 
tournament. The Tritons capped 
the tournament with a 15- 1 past-
ing of UC Davis. 

"Everybody's contri buting," 
Harper said. "It's been a lot of fun 

Sister act leads Tritons 
Meet J erinie and 
Bonnie Wilson 

BY BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

What do two of UCSD's top players on the 
women's volleyball team have in common, other 
than being among the team leaders in kills, attack 
percentage, digs and service aces? 

They're sisters. 
Meet Jennie and Bonnie Wilson . Jennie, a 

senior rrtiddle blocker, is one of the leaders of this 
year's team with her tremendous all -around play 
and tenacity. -

Bonnie, a sophomore transfer from the 
Urtiversity of New Hampshire, brings the Tritons 
another strong player at the outside hitter position, 
making an immediate impact. Bonnie joins setter 
Teresa Ohta, outside hitter Stacy Dunsmore and 
middle blockers Katie Hogan and Kendra Canape 
to form the Fabulous Fives: a group of five incred-
ibly talented members of the class of 2005 who 
have proven themselves a force to be reckoned 
with, and whose potential in the coming years is 
sky high. 

"It's pretty exciting to know that we have two 
more years," Bonrtie said. "We have great setters, 
hitters, everything. And there's more to come. 
[Head coach) Duncan [McFarlane) keeps recruit-
ing and trying to bring in the best. It's really neat to 
come into something so strong." 

Had it not been for Jennie's encouragement, 
however, the Fives rrtight have only been four. 
After a miserable year in New Hampshire, Bonnie 
set her sights back on California. Looking for a 
good education and a place to play volleyball , she 
narrowed her search to UC Berkeley, UCLA and 
UCSD. 

"In high school, we shared everything," Jennie 
said . "We shared our room, we sha red the ride to 
school; we carpooled. Every rrtinute- of our day 
was together, and then you go to practice togeth-
er, and if you have a frustrating practice, you go 
home together to study together in the same 
room. We didn't ever break out into a brawl out in 
the middle of the court, but it definitely wasn't my 
favorite." 

With a little space of their own, the Wilsons

or the fame 

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

You've all been asking, so it's time I answered. "Why do you write for 
the GUIlrdillT/?" 

You may assume it's for the 
money. There's one major problem 
with this assumption: I get thirsty 
when I write. By the time I've 
bought the 20-ounce Gatorade I 
need to finish the story, I've used 
half of what I'll earn for this col-
umn. If I need to use the phone to 
do an interview, there's a good 
chance I'm losing money on the 
whole thing. Money is not what 
motivates me to write. 

"For the fame!" you cry. "You 
must be working for the fame that 
you get from being a sports colum-
nist!" 

Fat chance. As my friend Sandi 
so eloquently expressed to me the 
other day, there are only five peo-
ple who read my column, and one 
of them is my mom. While I'd like 
to hope that there are a couple 
more people at UCSD picking this 
up, I admit that writing for this 
paper is not the best way to go 
about being world famous. In fact, 
Sandi would have gotten a kick out 
of me putting her name in print, 
but she doesn't read my column. 

"Uh oh," you grumble. "Are 
you one of those guys who always 
wanted to be a great athlete, but
