THE UPS AND DOWNS OF SUPER-SENIORITY ▶ OPINION, PAGE 4

Members of the A.S. External 
Office will set up shop alongside 
numerous voter registration drives 
taking place on campus this month, 
holding a nonpartisan drive on 
Library Walk and at Student Center 
next week in a push to register 
4,000 students before California’s 
Oct. 20 registration deadline for the 
upcoming presidential election.

Current voter registration num-
bers place UCSD fourth among the 
10 UC campuses in most student 
voters registered during campus 
registration drives.

“UCSD is pretty politically 
active, but obviously there is always 
room for more involvement by 
the student population,” A.S. Vice 
President of External Affairs Lisa 
Chen said.

In the final three days of UCSD’s  
Welcome Week leading up to the 
first day of classes, Chen led volun-
teers from her office in registering 

almost 1,700 incoming freshmen to 
vote in the election.

“The voter registration drive that 
the Associated Students External 
Office is leading is part of the larg-

er University of California Student 
Association vote campaign, which 
is the largest nonpartisan voter reg-
istration drive in California,” Chen 
said.

The registration drive was 
manned by students working as

UCSD professor of pharma-
cology Roger Tsien won the 2008 
Nobel Prize in chemistry yesterday 
for his role in discovering green 
fluorescent protein and developing 
the design of fluorescent molecules  
used to illuminate the inner work-
ings of cells and track the move-
ment of tagged proteins.

Informed of the news by the 
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 
early Wednesday morning, Tsien 
will share the $1.4 million prize 
with Osamu Shimomura of the 
Marine Biological Laboratory in 
Woods Hole, Mass., and Martin 
Chalfie of Columbia University in 
New York City. The official awards 
ceremony will 
take place in 
Sweden this 
December.

Tsien, 56, is 
a professor of 
pharmacology, 
chemistry and 
b i o c h e m i s t r y 
at UCSD, and 
sums up his 
life’s work as 
“building molecules to look inside 
of cells, allowing us to see beyond 
what the human eye can see.”

Before the discovery of fluores-
cent proteins, researchers interested 
in the intricacies of cellular func-
tions had to resort to less effective 
and often destructive methods of 
investigation, such as injecting cells 
with dye.

Using GFP as a research tool, 
however, scientists are able to view  
otherwise-invisible mechanisms by 
adding lights of certain wavelengths 
to proteins encoded with GDF, 
causing them to glow in fluorescent 
color without damaging the cell.

Tsien’s main role in the research 
was to improve the qualitative fac-
ets of invention, finding ways to 
make the GDF glow with more 
strength and in a variety of colors, 
enabling scientists to tag certain 
proteins and track their movements 
in real time. 

He also developed technology 
that allowed proteins to change col-
ors as their environment changed.

During a press conference yes-
terday morning, Tsien thanked 
his family, colleagues, all those 
who have used his discoveries to 
advance science and the jellyfish 
Shimomura first used to discover 
and isolate GFP in the 1960s.

lions of years, though for reasons

The number of cited campus-
area crimes has decreased over the 
past year, with burglary and motor 
vehicle theft at their lowest levels 
since 2005, according to the annu-
al Clery Campus Security Report 
released last week.

The report indicates that in 2007, 
the UCSD Police Department, San 
Diego Police Department, Campus 
Security Authorities and UCSD 
Medical Center recorded 63 bur-
glaries and 67 motor vehicle thefts, 
a decrease from the 2006 report, 
which showed 102 burglaries and 
152 motor vehicle thefts. The num-
ber of sex offenses by force, aggra-
vated assault, arson and robbery 
remained relatively consistent with 
2006 figures.

Despite the stagnant and down-
ward crime trends in the greater 
San Diego area, certain types of 
on-campus crime have increased 
since 2006. In 2007, the UCSD 
Police Department reported two 
sex offenses by force, following a 

decrease from eight such offenses 
in 2005 to zero in 2006. The num-
ber of aggravated assaults also rose, 
from two in 2006 to five in 2007, as 
did the number of robberies, from 
one in 2006 to two in 2007. Arson, 
however, decreased from five inci-
dents in 2006 to four in 2007.

The number of arrests due to 
drug, narcotics and alcohol posses-
sion more than doubled last year, 
with 76 made for drug and narcot-
ics possession and 100 for alcohol 
possession, compared to the 34 and 
36 arrests made, respectively, in 
2006.  

The number of disciplinary 
referrals handed out by campus 
authorities and the UCPD also 
increased, from 131 in 2006 to 247 
in 2007.  Drug-related disciplinary 
referrals totaled 1,591 in 2007, an 
increase from the 1,382 in 2006.

According to Police Chief 
Orville King, the trends observed 
in this year’s report do not nec-
essarily determine the course of 
future police activity. King referred 
to the report as a “retrospective 
analysis of the last academic year,” 
which is more “informational than 
actionable.” Rather than act upon 
the trends found in the report, the 
UCPD acts in accordance with day-
to-day happenings.

The Mic Might Be On 
But Nobody’s Listening

A Loft event Oct. 8, advertised as an “open mic night,” appeared to yield little interest from the student 
body. Event organizers invited students to introduce their favorite songs and play them over the newly 
opened nightclub’s stereo system, but by the start of the night nobody had showed up. 

Though campus crime 
is on the decline, 
narcotics and alcohol 
offenses more than 
doubled last year.

Oral vitamin D supplements may 
help prevent some skin infections 
caused by atopic dermatitis, the most 
common form of eczema, according 
to a UCSD School of Medicine study 
published last week.

Led by professor of medicine 
Richard Gallo and associate profes-
sor of medicine Tissa R. Hata, the 
research suggested that the use of 
vitamin D corrects an immune sys-
tem defect in those affected by the 
skin disease by boosting production 
of a protein called cathelicidin, which 
protects against microbial invasion.

Atopic dermatitis — a chronic skin 
disease characterized by severe itch-
ing, redness and scaling — affects 
10 to 20 percent of children and 1 to 
3 percent of adults, putting them at 
risk for Staph infections, herpes and 
smallpox.

“These results suggest that 
supplementation with oral vitamin 
D dramatically induces cathelicidin 
production in the skin of patients 
with atopic dermatitis,” Hata said. “It 
also slightly elevated its production in 

normal skin in this study.”
Other recent UCSD studies 

have linked vitamin D deficiency to 
increased rates of multiple cancers, 
diabetes and other diseases.

UCSD appointed solar pioneer 
Byron Washom as director of 
strategic energy initiatives on Oct. 
7 amid an ongoing effort to maintain 
its reputation as one of the nation’s 
greenest universities.

In 1984, Washom led his 
entrepreneurial firm, Advanco Corp., 
in setting a world record for solar 
electric conversion efficiency at 
29.4 percent. The record remained 
for 24 years until Sandia National 
Laboratories broke it earlier this year.

Washom has served as a strategic 
advisor for clean energy technologies 
at the World Bank, International 
Energy Agency, U.S. Department 
of Energy and national laboratories. 
He is a four-time Rockefeller 
Foundation grantee and Heinz 
Foundation grantee, and Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox awarded him the 

2008 Community Leader Award for 
Sustainability earlier this year.

“We are delighted that Byron 
Washom has joined the UC San 
Diego leadership team to help 
implement a cutting-edge vision 
and shared aspirations for quantum 
advancements in sustainability,” Fox 
said. 

UCSD’s future energy projects 
include the development of energy 
storage systems, renewable energy 
purchases from the grid during 
surplus periods and co-production of 
hydrogen from its fuel cell system.

“In my entire career and global 
travels, I have never witnessed 
such a combination of visionary 
leadership, opportunity and legacy 
infrastructure to build a global model 
of a sustainable and efficient energy 
infrastructure as we have here at UC 
San Diego,” Washom said.

Researchers at UC Irvine 
announced Oct. 7 that a fatty acid 
found in olive oil wards off hunger 
and could lead to the development of 

new drugs to limit and possibly even 
enhance appetite.

UC Irvine pharmacology professor 
Daniele Piomelli and his colleagues 
found that infusing the fat — oleic 
acid — into the intestines of rodents 
converted it into a fat messenger 
called oleoylethanolamide (OEA) that 
tells the brain the body is full.

“This OEA activates a receptor 
protein causing a specific type of 
satiety,” Piomelli said. “This pro-
tein initiates a series of physiologi-
cal events that lead to activation of 
nerves in the intestine.”

He said the long-term goal is to 
create a drug that slows OEA break-
down in the body, extending the feel-
ing of fullness. 

In addition, adjusting OEA levels 
could help people with decreased 
appetite.

“Our studies identify OEA as a key 
physiological signal that specifically 
links dietary fat ingestion to across-
meal satiety,” the report states. 
“Nutritional and pharmacological 
strategies aimed at magnifying this 
lipid-sensing mechanism, such as 
inhibitors of OEA degradation, might 
be useful in the treatment of obesity 
and other eating disorders.”

The next stage in planning for the 
UC School of Global Health, a pro-
posed systemwide graduate school 
that will train professionals to take 
on a variety of global issues, took 
place last month when university sci-
entists Haile Debas and Sir Richard 
Feachem formally proposed an out-
line for the school before the UC 
Board of Regents.

Debas, director of the UC San 
Francisco School of Global Health 
Sciences, and Feachem, who is a 
professor of global health at UCSF 
and UC Berkeley, intend the school 
to be an interdisciplinary effort that 
will meet the tremendous need for 
the training of new professionals 
to tackle increasing global health 
issues  — including pandemics, re-
emerging infections, chronic dis-
ease, poverty and healthcare dispar-
ities, climate change and the safety 
and security of global food and 
water supplies.

In a statement released by UCSF, 
Debas said the initiative is meant to 
respond not only to rising global health 
challenges in the state of California, 
but also to an enormous demand 
from the nation’s top post-graduate-
school applicants for programs that 
address global health needs. 

“Today’s level of interest in global 
health among UC faculty and students 
is phenomenal,” Debas said. “The best 
and the brightest students see the 
availability of global health training 
as a key factor in their selection of 

schools and training programs.” 
A recent UC survey of 46,505 

students at the San Diego and Los 
Angeles campuses revealed that 54 
percent of undergraduates are “some-
what or very interested” in a major 
or minor in global health, with 11 
percent expressing their interest in 
the persual of graduate-level studies 
in the field. 

A second survey revealed that 
more than 80 percent of UC fac-
ulty whose work addresses global 

health issues recognize a dire need 
for increased training at both masters 
and doctoral levels and in continu-
ing education courses for faculty and 
technical staff. 

“Global health extends beyond 
the traditional definition of interna-
tional or public health to include the 
critical connections between global 
issues and our own local communi-
ties, such as the effects of climate 
change on our health, migration, 

clean energy and the safety of our 
food and water,” Feachem said. “It also 
addresses issues such as the disparate 
life expectancies worldwide, diverse 
health systems, immigrants’ declining 
health while living in California, and 
the role immigration plays in filling 
California’s vast needs for nurses and 
other health-care workers.”

Alec Rosenberg, strategic com-
munications coordinator for the UC 
Office of the President, said that 
extensive development of the future 
graduate school has taken place over 
the last year.

“Planning for the school, which 
has been underway since August 2007, 
was originally proposed by the UC 
Long Range Guidance Team in 2005 
and was subsequently recommended 
by faculty on the UC Exploratory 
Committee,” he said.

According to Rosenberg, the pro-
posed school will be a multicampus 
program, with five or more global 
health centers that will link participat-
ing campuses throughout the state, 
and an administrative center at one 
of the 10 UC campuses. Each health 
center will focus on a separate major 
challenge, whether it be infectious 
diseases, climate change or food secu-
rity.

Initial planning for the UC School 
of Global Health was supported by 
an 18-month grant from UCOP. The 
planning of Phase II is currently 
underway and will be supported by 
grants from major donors.

New Grad School To Address Global Issues
posed activity fee referendum.

Most college senators announced 
that feedback regarding the proposed 
activity fee from students from their 
respective colleges was positive, though 
individuals such as Revelle College 
Senator Katie Hall emphasized the 
need for discussion about where the 
money from the referendum would go.

“If people can see that they’re sup-
porting student orgs, programming, 
especially sustainability [by voting for 
the referendum], I think it’ll make a 
big difference in how people vote,” 
Associated Vice President of Athletic 

Relations Peter 
Benesch said in 
agreement.   

Despite the 
obvious over-
whelming sup-
port for the ref-
erendum, the 
council was torn 

over prioritizing the funding of col-
lege, Student Affirmative Action 
Committee organizations and A.S. 
Programming events in addition to the 
concern regarding the tight campaign-
ing timeline brought up last week.

SAAC Representative Jia Wei 
brought to the council’s attention that 
SAAC organizations were apprehen-
sive that the primary focus of the 
fee would be directly support A.S. 
Programming, while leaving out stu-
dent organizations that desperately 
need additional funding from A.S.

“I don’t want to alienate the SAAC 
orgs,” President Donna Bean respond-
ed.  “They have a huge voice in slates 
that come up, but SAAC orgs are not 
the only orgs on this campus.”

Bean once again implored the 
council to consider the amount of 
funding that the programming office 
needs in order to operate and give 
students the events they have come to 
expect from the council.

The proposed A.S. activity fee increase was once again thrust into the spotlight at last night’s 
council meeting, although a final vote 
on the fee referendum was postponed 
until next Wednesday’s meeting.

The meeting began with a presenta-
tion from the Social and Environmental 
Sustainability Committee during pub-
lic input, which proposed to tack an 
additional $2.34-per-student-per-
quarter increase onto the proposed 
$16.35 A.S. activity fee referendum 
that would fund sustainability and 
green projects.

The repre-
sentatives from 
S.E.S.C. explained 
that the $85,400 
that the fee would 
go toward renting 
out the space for 
the Sustainability 
Resource Center, 
as well as the Green Initiative Fund for 
sustainability and green projects that 
would reduce the university’s impact 
on the environment. 

Brief reports from various council-
members followed the presentation.  
Sixth College Senator John Cressey 
implored senators to come to meet-
ings to discuss plans for the year.

“Thank you, all of you that have e-
mailed me,” Cressey joked. “For those 
that didn’t, you’re fired.”

Vice President of Student Life 
Darryl Nousome enthusiastically 
announced next week’s first ever UCSD 
Homecoming weekend, a new A.S. 
initiative meant to increase solidarity 
and school spirit among students and 
alumni. Nousome emphasized that this 
event is a chance to show alumni how 
much the campus has grown.

After a brief recap of the successes 
and pitfalls of FallFest, the council’s 
attention once again turned to yet 
another lengthy discussion of the pro-

we still don’t understand,” Tsien 
said. “None of this would have hap-
pened without the jellyfish.”

Tsien is now looking to work on 
treating cancer by targeting imaging 
agents and chemotherapy drugs at 
tumors.

“I’ve always 
wanted to do 
something clini-
cally relevant in 
my career, if pos-
sible, and cancer is 
the ultimate chal-
lenge,” Tsien said.

C h a n c e l l o r 
Marye Anne Fox 
offered her con-
gratulations to the 
Nobel laureate.

“I am delight-
ed to join the 
entire UC San 
Diego community, including the 
hundreds of scientists and graduate 
students worldwide who have col-
laborated with him, in congratulating 
and saluting Roger Tsien for win-
ning this year’s Nobel Prize in chem-
istry,” Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
said in a statement. “Roger joins the 
extraordinary and prestigious ranks 
of Nobel laureates at UC San Diego 

whose incredible scholarship is dedi-
cated to improving the lives of people 
throughout the world.”

Tsien earned a degree in chem-
istry and physics from Harvard 
College, received his doctorate at 
the University of Cambridge and 
first became a professor at UC 

Berkeley. 
He arrived to 

UCSD in 1989 and 
has been working  
with GFD technol-
ogy at the Howard 
Hughes Medical 
Institute.

 “Dr. Tsien’s 
work has, and will 
continue to have, 
an enormous 
impact on human 
health by enabling 
researchers to 
study cells related 

to disease in detailed ways that had 
never before been possible,” School 
of Medicine Dean David Brenner

“UCSD students are bombard-
ed by various interest groups on 
Library Walk,” Chen said. “But 
most of those people either get paid 
to do that work, are being given 
money by their organization for 
each card they get or they simply 
aren’t students but rather commu-
nity members,” Chen said.

Although politically partisan 
nonaffiliate groups are also allowed 
to register student voters on cam-
pus, Chen stressed that one of the 
primary goals of the A.S.-sponsored 
election drive is to strengthen the 
student voice at each UC campus.

“The Associated Students in 
coalition with UCSA is a student-
run, student-led voter registration 
drive that has a main purpose to 
build student power at each of our 
campuses,” Chen said. 

She added that the registration 
drive should demonstrate to law-
makers the importance of the stu-
dent voice in this election.

“We are not pushing some politi-
cal agenda, but rather showing legis-
lators that students need to be heard 
and we are an electoral constituency 
that needs to be recognized.”

According to the University of 
Maryland’s Center for Information 
and Research on Civic Learning 
and Engagement, people aged 18-
29 will make up 25 percent of the 
electorate in 2008, up from 21 per-
cent in 2006.

It is possible the same demo-
graphic could account for a full 
third of the electorate by 2015, 
C.I.R.C.L.E. predicts.

“Voter registration is critical in 
a healthy democracy and it’s essen-
tial that we encourage students to 
be a part of the political process,” 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue said. “Our students 
want to make an impact on the 
world and we support them during 
this election year.”

During the 2004 presidential elec-
tion, a number of students waited 
for over four hours to vote, due to 
a lack of available polling places on 
campus. 

Additionally, campus poll work-
ers ran out of ballots long before 
polls closed because they neglect-
ed to anticipate a strong student 
voter turnout, forcing a number 
of students to cast their votes on 
Vietnamese-language or Spanish- 
language ballot forms.

“These were major concerns of 
mine, so we have identified six 
different polling places on campus 
so that students will not be turned 
away by long lines come Election 
Day,” Chen said.

In order to correct this problem, 
the San Diego County Registrar 
of Voters, in conjunction with 
the university’s Office of Student 
Affairs, has planned to double the 
number of polling locations set up 
on campus from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. for 
the Nov. 4 election.

Campus polling locations on 
Election Day are set to be stationed 
near each of the university’s six col-
leges, as well as at RIMAC Arena, 
Mesa Apartments and Price Center.

To further build upon the reg-
istration effort, organizers also 
collaborated with the San Diego 
County Registrar’s Office to create 
a Web site that details the voting 
and registration process for stu-
dents who may be unfamiliar with 
the system. 

The site contains a list of voter 
FAQs as well as a link encourag-
ing students to contact the A.S. 
office with any questions that aren’t 
listed.

trends aren’t easily detected,” King 
said. 

He added that the statistics 
gathered by the report provide no 
conclusive evidence of patterns in 
crime.

“Also, because our numbers are 
low, a high per-
centage increase 
in a particu-
lar crime does 
not necessar-
ily indicate a 
trend,” he said. 
“While Clery 
reports activity 
of the previous 
year, our police 
d e p a r t m e n t 
tracks activity 
in real time to 
try and identify 
and respond to 
trends as they 
develop.”

The UCPD does not plan to 
implement any new changes based 
on the report’s statistics.

“Our statistics are fairly consis-
tent, so no significant changes in our 
methods of enforcement are planned 
at this time,” King said. 

The report, required under the 

Jean Clery Disclosure of Campus 
Security Policy and Campus Crime 
Statistics Act, catalogs the number of 
crimes reported on and around uni-
versity campuses over the past three 
years as well as the policies used 
for crime reporting and prevention, 
campus security and student disci-

pline. 
The act 

requires all colleg-
es and universities 
participating in 
financial-aid pro-
grams to record 
and publicly 
release informa-
tion on crime that 
occurs on campus 
and in surround-
ing areas, as well 
as to keep updated 
warnings on any 
potential threats 
to residents. 

Failure to 
abide by these requirements could 
cause suspension in federal finan-
cial-aid programs and a civil penalty 
amounting to as much as $27,500 per 
violation.

Here’s a little skeleton I’ve decid-ed to let out of my closet: this is my fifth year as a Triton. 
Yup — I’m a bona fide super-senior, 
complete with two almost-degrees and 
only seven classes left between now and 
freedom. 

I actually remember when the 
Tenaya Hall rooms weren’t triples, 
Tacone didn’t exist and the UCSD-
owned cliffs nature preserve in the La 
Jolla Farms neighborhood west of cam-
pus wasn’t locked at dusk to prevent 
freshmen from enjoying midnight ses-
sions on rocky outcroppings overlook-
ing the crashing waves below. (But I 
have to say mad snaps to the female 
security guard who has stubbornly out-
lasted these changes — yes, Muirons, 
she still dutifully patrols the unreal-
istically quiet, “Monsters Are Due on 

Maple Street”-esque neighborhood in 
her rent-a-cop mobile attempting to 
intimidate those trekking their way to 
full-moon keggers on Black’s Beach).

I’ve seen the campus expand 
immensely — through both increased 
enrollment and construction of new 
buildings and labs — watched admin-
istrators come and go and remember 
when annual undergraduate manda-
tory student fees (the university’s term 
for tuition) totaled $5,684, which actu-
ally seems affordable compared to 
the whopping $7,126 currently being 
sucked from us by the UC Board of 
Regents. 

I no longer stress about talking 
to professors, could give a rat’s ass 
about the bizarrely nonhuman pre-
meds slithering their way through 
my biology lectures and have learned 
that shelling out hundreds of pre-
cious dollars for a parking pass is a 

The Loft’s much-publicized wine tasting last week final-ly crystallized the mists 
of hypocrisy that UCSD student 
groups have been forced to deal 
with for all too long. While the A.S. 
Council has had to navigate irratio-
nal administrative roadblocks and 
an outdated and paternalistic alco-
hol advertising policy, it seems the 
rules don’t apply to UCSD’s most 
pretentious newbie. If administra-
tors are set on selectively enforc-
ing this policy — which they have 
repeatedly proved to be by treating 
it with the honor of the Constitution 
when students are concerned, but 
then somehow letting it slip from 
memory when it works to their 
advantage — the policy needs to be 
completely re-evaluated. 

Strictly prohibiting the advertise-
ment of alcohol at events is clearly 
an unnecessary measure in the first 
place. UCSD is not a dry campus, 
it’s a top-ranked public university 
filled with many of-age adults who 
are perfectly able to enjoy respon-
sibly, as illustrated by two years of 
successful Bear Gardens in addition 
to the Loft’s four-drink event. 

Whether the event’s emphasis is 
social or “educational,” the reality 
is simple: Sometimes, hardwork-
ing Tritons over the age of 21 just 
want to take an afternoon off with 
friends, pop some bottles and enjoy 

the day. And as long as they’re safe 
about it, there’s absolutely noth-
ing wrong with that. But this is 
no shock to campus higher-ups; if 
safety concerns were really at the 
root of their uncompromising con-
tempt for all things student-hosted 
and bubbly, they’d at least think 
twice before allowing the Loft to 
so widely publicize, or even host, 
its minimal-security four-drinks-
in-less-than-two-hours shindig. But 
the wine tasting — while snobby 
as all get out — did not confirm 
any of the countless complaints 

administrators have voiced about 
Bear Gardens. Students didn’t flood 
from their classes to attend, no 
outrageous brawls broke out and, in 
fact, not that much really happened. 
Some UCSD students had fun. The 
world did not implode.

The Loft’s wine tasting is a great 
step toward institutionalizing nor-
mal, healthy fun at UCSD. Now 
it’s time that administrators stop 
favoring their own pet projects and 
extend the same publicity privileges 
to the campus’ most important con-
stituency — its students.

Triton Tide’s newest spirit campaign, creatively named Triton Fridays, seeks to 
bedazzle the campus in blue and 
gold by bribing undergrads with 
shiny toys. Every person decked 
out in school gear who stops by the 
group’s booth between 10 a.m. and 
4 p.m. will be entered into a raffle.

The only problem? Rallying for 
a Library Walk dress-code change 
won’t fill the stands. Rather than 
probing students to remember 
UCSD pride when they open their 
closets Friday morning, the cam-
paign will likely make those with 

yellow wardrobes coincidental par-
ticipants, ultimately giving away an 
iPod — what a unique and coveted 
prize — and a Wii to students still 
just as unlikely to attend a game.

Perhaps if Triton Tide is prov-
ing time and time again — any-
one remember last year’s obscene-
foam-finger debacle? — that it is 
unable to spend funds wisely, the 
cash-strapped A.S. Council should 
re-evaluate its commitment to 
funding the athletic pride brigade. 
Plus, thanks to the 2006-07 athletic 
fee referendum students hand over 
tons of money to sports teams, giv-

ing them full capacity to pay for 
their own advertising. 

What Triton Tide just doesn’t 
seem to understand is that lame 
gimmicks are the last way to 
increase campus pride. But time 
after time the group seems to 
believe that if it wastes enough 
money on something stupid, the 
missing spark will ignite among 
undergrads, causing Tritons across 
campus to drop whatever they’re 
doing and rip off their jackets in 
perfect Clark Kent-fashion, reveal-
ing a sea of U-C-S-D body-painted 
man chests. If only.

But until the fiber of the uni-
verse splits, turning La Jolla’s sun-
baked campus into the Metropolis 
of DC Comics, maybe Triton Tide 
should funnel its celebratory ener-
gy and its student-funded budget 
toward initiatives that may actu-
ally encourage game attendance. 
For instance, wouldn’t starting such 
a raffle for school-color-wearing 
game attendees make much more 
sense? That way students would be 
encouraged to dust off the crick-
et-infested bleachers and actually 
show some support for UCSD’s best 
and brawniest.

STUDENT LIFE — Every once in a 
while, an event occurs that pushes 
even most apathetic people to stop 
what they are doing and, even if for 
the briefest of moments, actually care 
about what is going on around them. 

However, this university’s history 
of apathy — demonstrated most nota-
bly by the lack of student interest in  
referenda and even voting to fill the 
office of A.S. president — made the 
possibility for this to happen at UCSD 
laughable at best. 

At least, that was what history would 
have led most students to believe, 
until spring quarter of  2007, when 
school administrators attempted to 
pass a blatantly unconstitutional free-
speech policy during finals week and 
got caught.The entire problem started 
with a surprisingly crafty attempt to 
push the revision of the free-speech 

policy without the students noticing. 
An innocuous looking e-mail titled 
“Review of PPM 510-1 Section IX,” sent 
the week before finals, was designed by 
administrators to prevent any serious 
discontent, since students would sup-
posedly be too stressed to care about 
yet another agonizingly trivial e-mail 
from the university. But this message 
laid out extremely drastic limits to 
campus free speech policy, including 
prohibiting impromptu gatherings of 
more than 10 people.

Then suddenly, out of nowhere, an 
opposition movement arose. Massive 
Facebook groups started appearing. 
Protests started forming, and the 
issue even drew the attention of the 
American Civil Liberties Union. It 
seemed that, for a brief and glorious 
moment, the student body at UCSD 
would finally tell the administration 
to back off.

However, almost a year and a 
half later, the masses have returned 
to silence, and it’s not because jus-
tice triumphed and the administration 
decided once and for all to respect 
students’ rights as (supposedly) mature 
adults. Actually, the administration 
simply changed its strategy, attempt-
ing to outlast students by turning the 
rewriting of the policy into a pro-

cess so long and drawn out that stu-
dents would graduate before any end 
appeared in sight. That way, the policy 
revision could be picked back up after 
UCSD refilled itself with fresh-faced 
first-years unaware of the impending 
policy changes.

Sadly, this tactic has proven some-

what effective. In fact, after a few 
months the student body as a whole 
seemed to have forgotten about the 
issue entirely, and after almost a year 
and a half nothing is left of the bud-
ding student movement but a small 
group of activists, fighting on behalf of 

everyone else who is too busy to care. 
To think that UCSD came so close to 

a movement and then stopped is frus-
trating. More students were involved in 
the debate over the destruction of Sun 
God last year than are currently fight-
ing to maintain basic freedoms. Yes, 
taking away the spirit of Sun God will 
make the campus suck significantly 
more, but giving administrators the 
potential power to fine or arrest any 
student who dares to challenge their 
draconian policy, if enacted, is down-
right scary.  

And it really is the students who 
should be blamed. Although college 
is stressful, what with the studying, 
drinking and visiting parents every 
weekend, civil liberties should never be 
placed on the back burner.

In case anyone has forgotten, this 
policy would have required a permit 
for anyone doing anything anywhere 
on campus that made anyone else an 
unwilling audience. Is the attention 
span of the average UCSD student so 
short that such an insane policy only 
raises eyebrows for a few weeks? Is 
chemistry really so important that it is 
takes precedence over your ability to 
freely express yourself?

There is currently a coalition help-
ing to maintain the fight, but it needs 

all of the help that it can get. To help 
the coalition, fellow students must get 
informed, get pissed and then e-mail 
their A.S. Council representatives and 
administrators to show we will not be 
walked on. 

There’s even a Facebook group, 
“UCSD Defend Your Freedom of 
Speech, NOW,” so that you can get 
involved and find out how you are 
needed without leaving your chair. 
Could it get any easier? Plus, you get 
to satisfy that nagging sense of moral 
obligation, so put the textbooks aside 
for a few minutes and make something 
useful with your time.

Albert Einstein said that “the world 
is a dangerous place to live, not because 
of the people who are evil, but because 
of the people who don’t do anything 
about it.” Unfortunately, it seems that 
the vast majority of the UCSD campus 
fits perfectly into the latter category. 
With the problems present in global 
politics today, can future UCSD gradu-
ates who wouldn’t defend their own 
civil rights be counted upon to con-
tribute and make a positive impact on 
the world? Unless students act now, the 
prospect is disheartening.

What You 
Really Learn

“More students were involved in the debate over the destruction of Sun God last year than 
are currently fighting

Unless campus wakes up 
to defend basic rights, 
administrators will  
continue attempts at 
radical policy changes.

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 9, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

Columnist Fails to Give 
‘Folks’ Enough Credit 

Dear Editor,
Articles like Hadley Mendoza’s 

“Question This Column; Your Future 
Is Too Important Not To,” about the 
upcoming election, demonstrate some 
possible reasons for two trends in cur-
rent American political discourse that 
she probably despises: media “talking 
points” and what she calls “anti-intel-
lectualism” in the heartland.

First, there is the issue of what 
I’ll call the 30-second sound bite pre-
sentation that both Republicans and 
Democrats often utilize when talk-
ing to the media, which, and here I 
do agree with Mendoza, sometimes 
dumbs down the discourse on what 
are often complex and critical issues.  
Pundits like to blame the short atten-
tion span of American viewers for this 
phenomenon, but the experience of 
having my more complex responses 
skewered on the cutting room floor in 
interviews just like Mendoza’s has led 
me to believe that the real reason may 
be quite different.  Proponents of either 
political agenda are forced to neuter 
their arguments and condense them 
into talking points because present-
ing them in that way makes it much 
harder to have their comments cut off 
and spliced together to form any mon-
ster of the interviewers’ choosing (a la 

Michael Moore).  In other words, the 
reason political pundits stick to lame 
talking points is that they are much 
harder for angry liberal columnists 
to manipulate into something never 
intended by the interviewee.

Second, the condescending tone 
Mendoza takes toward ordinary hard-
working Americans is a perfect exam-
ple of the attitude of many liberal intel-
lectuals exhibit toward average folks 
(those would be the people Mendoza 
sneers at for voting based on a per-
sonal affinity for Gov. Sarah Palin).  If 
only these ignoramuses were properly 
indoctrinated, err, I mean educated, 
in leftist university classes, they would 
instantly see the error of their ways 
and, to paraphrase the words of the 
candidate Mendoza obviously sup-
ports, stop clinging to their guns and 
religion. The truly stunning part of 
this attitude is that, after metaphori-
cally upending her drink on America’s 
heartland, Mendoza, and many who 
think like her, have the gall to bemoan 
the “anti-intellectualism” of the people 
to whom she is so condescending. How 
can you spit in someone’s eye and then 
expect them to admire you and say 
“Thank you sir, may I have another?” 
Please. No wonder many people dislike 
the academic elite.

The original intention of the uni-
versity was to be a place where students 
could come to learn about and debate 
all types of intellectual, philosophical 

and political points of view. Necessary 
to this high ideal is a basic level of 
respect; a willingness to accept that a 
fully educated, intelligent and rational 
human being can disagree with your 
political views. And sadly, it seems that 
on UCSD campus, like many others 
around our country, this sort of respect 
is a thing of the past.

Council Must Put 
Students First at FallFest
Dear Editor,

FallFest’s failure did not depend on 
the acts booked or the sheer volume of 
students excited to attend. The failure 
alone sits upon the shoulders of the 
A.S. Council. Councilmembers failed 
to recognize that FallFest is a con-
cert for the students, run by the stu-
dents. They also fail to recognize that 
UCSD undergraduate students are not 
customers and that the council does 
by no means provide customer ser-
vice. Undergraduates do not purchase 
tickets for every concert or council 
event held on campus. We provide the 
money up front through our activity 
fees. Our admittance to every concert 
is paid for, in full, and is not bought. 
For the council to consider itself a 
concert venue extends the concept 
of the council itself. The council is a 

campus organization and not a con-
cert venue. The council does not book 
acts and then sell tickets to the general 
public, therefore undergraduate stu-
dents are not its customers.

This idea that students are cus-
tomers led to the additional prob-
lem of prioritization. Outsiders were 
considered above students because 
they fund “a significant portion of the 
event.” Students provide the bulk of 
the funding and are already charged 
admittance to all concerts. We are 
your primary source of budget fund-
ing. If the funding for a concert is 
at least $200,000, then the $14,400 
provided by outside ticket buyers is 
chump change.

Since all acts require payment up 
front the 800 tickets sold for FallFest 
only replaces a portion of the funds 
that you paid for Lupe Fiasco.

To say that the $18 per ticket is a 
source of revenue is true, however, 
to say that the revenue gained from 
the ticket sales affected your ability to 
book acts is untrue. It may affect your 
ability to fund additional events but 
it should not have a significant affect 
because you separate the total budget 
funds for the year into small events 
and three large concerts for the year. 
If you already know how much you 
will have for each event then keep the 
event within its predetermined means. 
Do not say that we need to have tickets 
to provide for part of the concert if the 

additional funding of $18 per 800 tick-
ets sold does not affect your budgeting 
for the year since it is predetermined, 
but instead say that it provides extra 
funding for future events and your 
T-shirts.

Garrett Berg, you and the council 
forget that the concert is for UCSD 
undergraduates. We come first because 
we are mandated to pay your activity 
fee. FallFest is a concert whose main 
focus is to involve undergraduates and 
anyone who is not an undergraduate 
should not have such an outstand-
ing focus. Your opinion that ticket 
purchasers are an important source 
of revenue does not acknowledge that 
UCSD undergraduates are your largest 
source of revenue. Keep in mind who 
the concert is intended for.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN By Niven Wilson

horrible decision when the neighbor-
hoods adjacent to Revelle College and 
the Theater District are teeming with 
lonely unpainted curbs begging for 
company.

But with this milestone comes a 
price: less financial aid. My Cal Grant 
is dried up and my S.M.A.R.T. Grant 
eligibility has expired, and although 
UCSD supported me through a gen-
erous campus grant this year and I 
took out the maximum Stafford Loan, 
I still did not have enough aid money 
to ride out my final three quarters as 
a Triton without supplementing some 
of it myself.

So, determined not to let the change 
in my financial-aid status get me down, 
I swallowed my reluctance and began 
searching for employment. And not 
just any job, mind you, but one that 
paid more than the $8 minimum wage, 
because there was no way in hell I was 
going to wash dishes at Jamba Juice ever 
again. (Suck it, Strawberries Wild.)

After being turned away by Trader 
Joe’s (not hipster enough, I guess) and 
Best Buy (long story, but I didn’t pass 
the retarded online interview), I started 
feeling discouraged. But then, as I was 
meandering my way through Home 
Depot one fateful August afternoon in 
search of tiki-torch fluid, it hit me: Why 
not apply here? 

So that night I submitted my appli-
cation, and was pleasantly surprised to 
receive a phone call the next afternoon 
requesting that I come in for an inter-
view. After responding to several hypo-
thetical situations (“What would you 
do if a customer was buying a $300 drill 
but you knew the job could be effec-
tively completed with a $100 drill?”) 
and completing my video training in 
Escondido, I was hired. Piece of cake.

And then, orange apron and all, I 
found myself manning a register for 
$10 an hour. Although memorizing 
SKU codes (don’t ask) has been the 
most difficult part of the job, what I 
really want to talk about is how much 
I’ve re-evaluated my own position as a 
customer in a retail environment.

Yes, I went in for one reason: money 

to help me pay for school. But I’ve come 
out with a whole new appreciation for 
retail employees after being exposed to 
the horrors of the customer world.

Seriously, people traipse in all 
flustered and expect you to know the 
exact location of their very specific 
item in a store that sells approximately 
40,000 different products. Directing 
them to a general area is oftentimes 
not enough, and I’ve received a glare 
or two from customers who somehow 
think employees can flawlessly zero in 
on every item in the store within a five-
centimeter radius.

Even worse are customers who 
think cashiers have the answers to their 
intricate plumbing or electrical ques-
tions and seem surprised — even dis-
gusted — when you tell them you need 
to call an associate from the depart-
ment to explain differences in copper 
pipe sizes.

But the customers who take the 
cake are the ones who bitch at you 
for reasons entirely out of your con-
trol: “there’s no price tag on this item,” 
“everyone in the flooring department 
is busy helping other customers,” “you 
don’t carry the product I need” and, of 
course, “these prices are outrageous.” 

So while Home Depot has defi-
nitely fattened my wallet this quarter, 
working in the giant warehouse has 
also helped me realize that people, 
myself included, really need to be 
realistic when they walk into a store 
and wait patiently while the employee 
addresses their concerns. Lighten up if 
an employee doesn’t know the imme-
diate answer to your question as long 
as that employee is doing everything 
within his or her power to find some-
one else who does.

Being a poor fifth-year student 
has definitely forced me to appreciate 
students who work hard to pay their 
way through school; many of them are 
anonymous faces in your local retail 
stores who juggle homework, extra-
curricular activities and a social life 
in addition to their job duties, which 
include dealing with crabby customers. 

That said, I can’t wait until I get a 
real job.

Employees a Break

MADHOUSE COMEDY PROVES THAT LIMITLESS POSSIBILTIES CAN AMOUNT TO A WHOLE LOTTA NOTHING

BY SONIA MINDEN         HIATUS EDITOR

M aybe it’s in his disturbingly convincing perfor-mance as a Slavic gypsy or the mink-swathed ’50s mobster Queenie Bartlett — but at the end of the 
night, director/primadonna Charles Busch’s latest play 
seems an overdone, cat’s-cradle effort to justify his not-
so-secret whimsy for kitten heels. But did we really expect 
anything less from the man who brought us “Vampire 
Lesbians of Sodom”?

Now in its fourth week at La Jolla Playhouse, “The Third 
Story” misses many a sequin in repatching the campy glit-
ter of “Sodom.” Somewhere between mad science experi-
ments, lipstick shoot-’em-ups and country folklore, we lose 
interest in what it’s all adding up to and resign to a state of 
dizzied (albeit entertained) bafflement.

Indeed, the story here is actually a story-in-a-story-in-a-
story, held down by a few spare thematic anchors and knot-
ted loosely with vaudeville one-liners. Every flick of Busch’s 
flamboyant wrist introduces another conflict, another 
costume change, another a-ha climax until the once-giddy 
hyperbole is sucked of all initial shock value, and we’re left 

with a theater full of stylized, fictional clutter. 
The opening story plants us far, far away in an enchant-

ed woods, where Princess Vasalisa (Rebecca Levy) meets 
drag-witch Baba Yaga (Busch), who grants the pathologi-
cally shy girl a socially-endowed identical twin to seduce 
the town prince. The plan goes that once a wedding date is 
set, the double will vanish and Vasalisa will be left with her 
tidy, happily-ever-after ending. 

Cut to 1950s Nebraska. Washed-up screenwriter Peg 
(Mary Beth Peil) tries to convince her son — a self-pro-
claimed postal worker decidedly retired from Hollywood  
— to enter a partnership that will allow him to take one last 
stab at lighting up the silver screen. Aware of his mother’s 
generally selfish motives, Drew (Jonathan Walker) ignores 
her manic sales pitch. 

Their name-dropping banter (“Mom, do you have 
anything in your past besides slugging Ginger Roberts?”) 
persists until Peg digs up one of Drew’s old plays. The 
discovery prompts a rapid unfolding of potential plotlines, 
crammed with desert murder scenes and sci-fi flair.

In concurrent reality, we have already begun to witness 
the fast-unraveling product of Peg’s zealous brainstorming 
— a “third story” hinged on chic mobster Bartlett (Busch), 
whose most threatening adversary is the terminal cancer 
wracking her hefty figure. With couture poise, Bartlett 
asserts that she must find a way to protect her son Steve 
(Walker) from the feds after her death, since the poodle-
prim girly-boy obviously can’t protect himself. 

Only one person can help this femme fatale: her mor-
phine dealer Zygote (Scott Parkinson), a botched product 
of human cloning. With “shit for brains” (literally, as he 
hides an accidental anus under his toupee). Zygote directs 
Queenie to his maker — tough-gal scientist Constance 
Hudson (Jennifer Van Dyck)  — who, after learning of the 
dying woman’s dilemma, agrees to use her experimental 
life’s work to forge Queenie a bona fide twin. That is, until 
she learns of her client’s criminal background, and rejects 
the groundbreaking, scientific prospect on grounds of 

Flimsy Characters Fizzle 
Along ‘Ember’ Quest

City of Ember
   

Starring Tim Robbins & Bill Murray 
Directed by Gil Kenan

Rated PG

By Philip Rhie
Staff Writer

O n paper, “City of Ember” reads like a recipe for cinematic success. Based on a best-selling novel trailing the underground adventures of two 
mousy kids, the flick is produced by famed family man 
Tom Hanks and swamped with award-winning actors, 
including Saoirse Ronan (the Chloe Sevigny lookalike 
of “Atonement” fame), Bill Murray and Tim Robbins 
— even director Gil Kenan has his “Monster House” 
Oscar credentials. Unfortunately, all the prestigious 
guest lists and shiny lights in Hollywood can’t salvage 
this snoozer. 

“City of Ember” may have an impressive cast, but their 
abilities are never exercised, leaving character develop-
ment on the back burner. Instead, we witness a rare 
cinematic occasion, in which a gaggle of esteemed talent 
squawks like amateurs of their craft. The characters never 
mature from their expository shells and, consequently,

“Invasion of the Body Snatchers”

Unfailingly resurrected every 20 years or so,  “Invasion 
of the Body Snatchers” is once again made culturally 
relevant in 2008. First inspired by the economic crisis 
of 1978, this classic paints the politics of fear and 
conformity with a fine sci-fi glaze. Following McCarthyism 
and the recent war on terror, Philip Kaufman upturns the 
original’s catasrophic elements to shed light on more 
modern traumas. (EG)

As the joke goes, UC San Diego is the official hon-ors-nerd backup school, home to an awkward conglomerate of all those academically gifted 
enough to avoid Irvine but too white/Asian/boring to 
get past the UCLA personality and diversity boards.

In this particular nerd’s case, UCSD wasn’t backup 
— in fact, it was top of the list — but that sad fact has 
most everything to do with one silly little error by a 
high-school guidance counselor who, in her careful 
planning of my entire future, somehow got into her 
head that UCSD had a top-notch journalism program 

waiting for me with open arms. (Our university, in 
fact, barely even offers a course in the field.)

Arriving to my dark freshman dungeon in the bot-
tom of Tenaya Hall that fateful September, dejected 
and without a career prospect in the world, I’ll admit 
that I too felt a small wave of the backup-school blues. 
So I unpacked and switched on my cute-ass child-
hood television set — complete with doctor’s-visit 
stickers and a built-in VCR — to find Koala editor 
Steve York’s hairy ass bobbing where my favorite 
Disney Princesses used to prance. And that’s when I 
knew that everything would be all right.

Yep — we might not have had a journalism pro-
gram, but as I learned so very well that evening (and 
the three next evenings I absolutely did not spend 
catching re-runs), we sure as hell had “Koala TV.” 
Now, being an official Guardian head, it probably does 
not serve my cause to admit this — but after hitting the 
racks and thoroughly digging both publications that 
Fall, it was the Koala that made me thank the prison 
bricks above my dorm bunk that I’d ditched Berkeley 
for this science experiment down south. 

The most classic and detrimental symptom of 
fandom is to idealize the way things used to be; still, 
I admittedly compare every new issue of the Koala to

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 9, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  11

MADHOUSE COMEDY PROVES THAT LIMITLESS POSSIBILTIES CAN AMOUNT TO A WHOLE LOTTA NOTHING ethical conduct. This unleashes 
a whirlwind of sheisty behavior, 
culminating in —

Well, we’ll stop the rollercoaster 
there. After all, it would be wrong to 
strip the final surprise from a play so 
dependent on nail-biters. Of course, 
amid the many stilted cliffhangers 
and two-dimensional scene shifts, it 
becomes apparent that “Third Story” 
is framed by some underlying moral 
about a mother’s love. Or twins. Or 
girl power. Or maybe the impos-
sibility of duplicating a mother’s love 
— especially when she packs a hand-
held machine gun in her purse.

Apart from the deeper message, 
a handful of clumsy performances 
keep audiences in slumped confusion 
at a moment intended to set them 

on seat’s edge. Though the opener’s 
Russian fairytale does double trouble 
with childlike whimsy, it teeters on 
stiff quips that protract an already 
lengthy discourse. 

And speaking of contrived, the 
mother-son soap opera in Nebraska 
is all a game of intellectual tug-of-
war, chock with so much eye-rolling 
and snappy comebacks that we feel 
like spanking them when they finally 
reach reconciliation.

It’s not all watch-checking, 
though. The clutter is at least an 
artful mess, and a few characters 
do shine through. Zygote’s faith-
fully exaggerated defects alight an 
equally twisted nature (“I’m a tough 
fit — maybe it’s that pesky seventh 
nipple”). Dr. Hudson balances his 
twitchy self-loathing with a cold 

reservation that only briefly touches 
on humanity.

The heavily streamlined mini-
malism of the set design and car-
toonish costumes also indulge the 
eye, often the only theatrical ele-
ments that keep us locked into the 
picture. Like dressing the Jetsons in 
runway Chanel, a panache of colors 
and bold lines saturate otherwise 
cloudy dialogue. 

It’s hard to say what went 
through Busch’s head when he first 
drafted “The Third Story.” A drag 
queen confronting her Oedipus 
complex? A Hollywood romance 
starring fashionable zombies? 
Whatever the case, Busch’s fun-
house imagination never fails to 
be amusing, if at times inacces-
sible.

Amnesia Caused by Campy Time Warp

Plot Holes Drain ‘City’ of Drama
never forge emotional connections 
with the audience. The entire first act 
is a tedious observation of mundane 
go-abouts — yet we’re shorted insight 
into the motivation behind such rou-
tine activities. 

For instance, when introduced to 
Doon Harrow’s (Harry Treadaway) 
raving obsession with repairing the 
city’s only generator, we’re never 
given reasoning for this degree of 
fervor. Is he attempting to redeem his 
father’s failures, or simply working 
for the sake of goodness? 

Similarly, Lina Mayfleet (Ronan) 
is introduced as a child burdened 
with the task of looking after both her 
grandmother and younger sister — 
yet, we’re never certain as to how she’s 
even capable of upholding this mature 

responsibility. With only foggy char-
acter details and flimsy reasoning, it’s 
impossible to keep our attention span 
from fizzling out. Unsurprisingly, 
the insubstantial characters fail to 

tell a compelling story. By the time 
the first act snails past, our sense of 
detachment has stunted all dramatic 
intrigue. Since the cast functions as 
little more than a rigid plot mecha-
nism, any feeble stab at depicting 
heated suspense or climactic action 
is in vain. When the protagonists are 
forced to solve a number of challeng-
ing puzzles to escape their disinte-
grating underground city, we’re left to 
wonder how they’re even capable of 
making such brilliant decisions under 
pressure. How did Doon realize that 
the arbitrary symbol on the door was 
actually a keyhole, or Lina think to 
look behind the lockers to discover 
the secret passageway?  There’s weak 
basis to our heroes’ wisdom, and this

12  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, OCTOBER 9, 2008

Jizzlam, the Barton regime (archives, 
baby) and the first time I heard a 
Revelle-fat-chick joke. But upon return-
ing from abroad this quarter (read: now 
that I’m a cultured schmuck), eager 
to indulge in some good-old-fashioned 
racist and sexist stabs like only the Koala 
can deliver, I soon felt a new set of 
critic’s welts begin to deepen in my brow 
and a violent urge to complain about 
the fact I hadn’t laughed for a good five 
minutes. So, seeing as one can only deny 
her deepest urges to player hate for so 
long — here it is, my first official rant 
on our nasty little brother next door, 
and perhaps a plea to the new crop of 
recruits (currently barfing and sexing 
all over the Student Center bathrooms 
— good beginnings) to stop talking 
about your dicks for one second and 
realize the ridiculous potential such an 
unregulated publication holds.

First and least importantly, leave the 
dorky shit to us. Alliteration and flowery 
descriptions of the douches on Library 
Walk is an insult to the standards of 
raging inappropriateness on which the 
Koala was founded. We all wish we were 
in the position to be as disgusting as you 
— at least take the job seriously and dig 
a little deeper up your insulting assholes 
for that real gold shit. You owe it to the 
legend of your publication.

Secondly, what being a boring writer 
has taught me is that no matter how 

superficially ridiculous, everything must 
exist for a reason. Jokes about cock-suck-
ing rape victims and Asian losers are not 
funny just because they’re dickish and 
derogatory. Okay, fine, maybe a little. 
But anyone can throw around stuff like 
cunts and sacreligion and dirty fags and 

get a reaction based on pure shock value, 
kindly set up by times not-so-long past 
in which those words represented some-
thing pretty shitty for a lot of people. The 
best racist jokes, in fact, are often making 
a commentary on their own origins. I’m 
all for keeping around the flippant sexism 
and shit — that is, after all, what initially 
turned me on to the Koala — but don’t 
insult your rampant free-speech oppor-
tunity and waste everyone’s A.S. fees by 
using offensive keywords as an insta-
funny factor. And on that note, yes, there 
is a shelf life to “fucking the shit out of 

vulnerable freshman chicks” jokes — the 
new crop of which promptly caused me 
to wind the entire issue around the toi-
let-paper peg in our bathroom at home, 
ready for that moment in which it could 
possibly find a higher purpose to serve.

I’ve shared many a drunken couch 
conversation with the randy kids over at 
the Koala, and know they generally like 
to mouth off about the first amendment 
and dramatically defend their God-given 
right to effectively piss off as many peo-
ple as possible. But if you’re only fighting 
for the luxury of being a douchebag on 
a widely circulated piece of newsprint, 
the whole free-speech thing sort of loses 
sight of its original purpose for existing. 
Being an uncensored dick is only funny 
if one is somewhat self-aware. We’re all 
a bunch of privileged, highly educated 
college assholes with the time to make 
fun of everything and everyone — so 
stop jacking yourselves off and make 
use of it with offensive shit that actually 
means something, because jizzing out a 
self-important party review is surely not 
as wildly funny for everyone else in your 
line of fire.

In the end, carelessly ripping on the 
Koala is just another one of its many 
perks, since its own principles invalidate 
any sort of offense its contributors could 
take. Too bad, really — we need some 
fucking controversy around here. Or 
at least a homemade porn for the new 
generation of freshmen to hope on.

ultimately strips their trials and 
tribulations of all believability.

But “City of Ember” isn’t com-
pletely without merit — its one 
redeeming factor lies in phenom-
enal art direction. Vividly inspired 
compositions of color and light 
work to create a breathtaking 
dream world. Where attention to 
character and story progression 
feels a halfhearted sketch, visual 
aesthetics painstakingly fill in the 
lines. In the opening scene — as 
we’re introduced to the Builders 
of Ember — we follow the bright 
royal blue of a founding father as 
he walks through the pearly white 
of a long hallway, creating jar-
ring contrast in his wake. When 
the camera pans over Ember, the 

pathwork of a city drenched in 
glorious orange hues suddenly 
transpires from the darkness of its 
surroundings.  

While expertly fashioned, the 
almost too-pretty aesthetics can’t 
salvage our suspense of disbelief, 
already shred by unlikable pro-
tagonists and cumbersome story-
telling. At no point does Ember 
seem post-apocalyptic — not to 
mention capable of housing one of 
the last civilizations of humanity. 

Of course, if defined by only 
outstanding art direction, then 
“City of Ember” is truly a modern 
achievement in filmmaking. But 
since a great story can’t rest on its 
digitally rendered haunches, the 
kid flick has little hope of “Harry 
Potter” heights.

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 9, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  13

A s the second installment of the Pussycat Dolls’ pop repertoire, Doll Domination arrives on the heels of lead singer Nicole Scherzinger’s 
planned solo debut, and overflows with such a variety 
of party tricks that it feels like an as-seen-on-TV “Top 
Pops” album, stuffed with B-sides and all sorts of other 
obscurities. 

First single “When I Grow Up” was unleashed on 
the world in advance, and if artistic success could be 
determined based solely on the number of high school 
girls shouting along and gettin’ dirty on the dance floor 
— or by drunk 30-somethings doing the same — then 
Domination might have real promise. 

While most of the songs drown in overproduction, 
hit-maker Timbaland immaculately conceives four 
tracks, including the funky, jazzed-up “In Person” and 
“Whatchamacallit” — complete with laser-show beats 
reminiscent of Britney Spears’ “Toxic.” 

The R. Kelly-produced “Out of This Club” pounds 
a piano track off a kid’s follow-along keyboard — and, 

although the soft duet of Scherzinger and Kelly almost 
paint a scene of two clubgoers having a genuine moment 
mid-freak, the track gets buried in a Lil’ Jon imperson-
ator’s hey-heys and the moans of a bored porn star too 
tired to fake passion. 

In “Bottle Pop,” Snoop Dogg lends smoky smooth 
vocals that embody a chill only possible after a lifetime 
of doobies. But either the Dolls’ management couldn’t 
pay enough or he had to run off for a smoke, because 
Snoop’s presence comes and goes quicker than a dime-
bag. The rest is, essentially, three minutes of filler.

A bonus disc for the album, which delivers seven 
extra tracks to Domination’s bulging 16, includes “If 
I Were A Man” — a hardly remixed version of an 
obscure Jane Child song — and a cabaret tune in bur-
lesque fashion that fits like a corset, highlighting what 
the Dolls do best: put a little back into it.

Deerhoof
■ Offend Maggie
KILL ROCK STARS

T his is where the ’Hoof go acoustic. After a string of solid full-lengths, from the bare-bones chaos of Apple O to the honed pop-noise craft of last year’s 
Friend Opportunity, kid-friendly Japanese singer/bass-
ist Satomi Matsuzaki, drum spazz Greg Saunier, elec-
tric trickster John Dieterich and new guitar-guy Ed 
Rodriguez take the troupe back to a four-piece with 
their ironically subdued ninth album, Offend Maggie. 

The album cover says it all: a pencil sketch of 
a shirtless (and faceless) man posing with his leg 
propped on a chair. Stiffer restraint and convention are 
the new directions Deerhoof unconsciously decide on 
for this go-round — while Maggie marks new heights 
of accessibility that may sting fans of the damaged-car-
toon themes in “Panda” or “Milkman,” the indie-pop 
foursome still holds it down.

Their newfound natural tones are best represented 
in the title track, which pairs religiously fingerpicked 
guitar with Matsuzaki and Saunier’s effortless vocal 
harmonies, all sandwiched between their trademark 
electric crunch. But it feels almost too effortless, like 

the prodigy children got self-aware and lazy amid the 
creative process, always knowing that the end-product 
would still be catchy at the very least. “Basket Ball Get 
Your Groove Back” revisits the overt cuteness of past 
Deerhoof fame but forgets the noise factor, essentially 
neutering their winning formula and leaving behind 
little more than pleasant novelty. 

The blend of innocence and perversion on “My 
Purple Past” starts with rock chug and moves to 
Satomi’s harmless trills, finally reaching a quiet revela-
tion that rises to an orchestrated climax. Sadly, that 
potent gem is followed by the mildly awkward “Family 
of Others,” which finely showcases Saunier’s breathy 
voice, but ends up evoking the wispiness of a cheesy 
folk group, ever-accentuated by ascending harmonies.

Although Maggie may not be as immediate as its 
classic predecessors, many of its tracks keep the weird 
Deerhoof spirit intact and exude a playfulness no other 
band could ever hope to imitate.

14  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, OCTOBER 9, 2008

D etroit just doesn’t stop. Maybe it’s the plight of a city in depression while the rest of the country’s stuck in recession, or maybe it’s 
the deep historic roots of Motor City music. 
Either way, Detroit has been running shit for a 
minute now in hip-hop. Up next is Nick Speed’s 
protégé Danny Brown, who — armed with sharp 
wit, intense delivery and an equally swift pen — is 
poised to continue the city’s hard-hitting tradi-
tions. Although street rap from an ex-con might 
look like the furthest thing from progressive hip-
hop on paper, one listen to a Danny verse will 
show heads that he’s far from the typical mixtape 
rapper.  

Brown’s debut is produced almost entirely by 
Speed, and though it sticks mostly to the streets 

of the D, struggling and smoking weed, Danny’s 
lyrical irreverence and Speed’s  versatility save the 
album from redundancy. 

The uncut energy of Juan Atkins-sampling 
single “What Up Doe” is infectious, but it’s even 
doper that the same duo can turn around and pro-
duce the heartfelt “Two Steps Back,” with neither 
seeming forced. 

It’s refreshing to find a hard new artist who isn’t 
afraid to get sensitive at moments, and whether 
consoling his girl or selling crack, Danny raps 
every line on Hot Soup like it’s his last, channeling 
thug life into every last narrative.

Murs
■ Murs for President
WARNER BROS.

V eteran Living Legends emcee Murs — Making Underground Raw Shit — makes his major-label debut  this fall with Murs for 
President, an awkward mainstream transition 
considering his self-defined indie persona.

President’s production list promises an 
expert array of beats; however, bigshots like 
Keith Harris fall from a once-lofty, self-set 
benchmark. His gimmicky “Lookin’ Fly” slides 
into a predictable top-40 formula despite despa-
rate efforts to mash the manic skittering of the 
Green Hornet theme with recycled insta-beats. 

Fortunately, Murs is occasionally able 
to break out of the plastic pop veneer. “I’m 
Innocent” survives on 9th Wonder’s tried-and-
true Motown methods, and newcomer Scoop 
DeVille contributes a polished slate of flute and 
snare for “The Science,” an easy stroll that pays 
its dues to Cut Chemist’s stripped-down style.

The ambitious Michael Jackson sample on 

“Can It Be” backs an insistent tribute to modest 
beginnings, but the newly jaded Murs loses a 
layer of profundity in his Warner Bros. unveil-
ing. While inspirational lines hailing the “power 
of a pen, power of a vote, power of your words, 
power of your voice” begin to rally hopefuls, 
they are followed by words of jumbled wisdom: 
“Life is like a table, full of, like, glasses of water, 
and your job is to keep ’em all full, you know 
what I’m sayin’?” No Murs, not really. 

Murs for President can best be described as 
unfocused — both in lyrical stamina and the 
instrumention that hardly holds it up. From 
racial banter to adolescent observations about  
Asians “with natural D’s,” it’s not exactly clear 
whether the sitcom rapper will win the popular 
vote this time around.

UCSD Bounces Back From OT Loss

League 
Perfection 

Personified by 
Lady Tritons

All Goose Eggs in Tie With Humboldt

By Matt Croskey
Senior Staff Writer

WOMEN’S SOCCER — After suffer-
ing a heartbreaking double-overtime 
loss to Cal State San Bernardino on 
Sept. 28, the UCSD women’s soccer 
team rebounded with a pair of confer-
ence victories over the weekend. 

The Tritons showed they could 
handle overtime pressure as they 
defeated No. 12 Sonoma State 2-1 in 
the first overtime and followed the 
win with a dominating performance 
over Humboldt State 3-0.

Senior forward Natasha Belak-
Berger said the team rebounded well 
from the disappointing loss to the 
Coyotes against two formidable con-
ference opponents. 

“You never like losing to anyone, 
especially Cal State San Bernardino,” 
she said. “It was a hard loss and we 
just wanted to come out strong against 
Sonoma and Humboldt. Our fresh-
men are improving every game with 
more experience and it shows.”

The victories put UCSD back into 
a tie for first place with Cal State 
Dominguez Hills in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association South 
Division with a 6-2-0 conference 
record.

One freshman came through 
offensively as three different Tritons 
scored for UCSD in the second half 
to topple Humboldt State on Oct. 5. 
After a scoreless opening half, fresh-
man forward Sarah McTigue received 
a cross from junior midfielder Alexia 
Zatarain and nailed the upper right 
corner of the goal to give the Tritons a 
1-0 lead in the 67th minute.

Belak-Berger and senior midfielder 
Laura Borenstein added a goal each in 
the final 20 minutes, and McGovern 

recorded her fifth shutout of the year.
The Tritons rebounded from their 

loss to Cal State San Bernardino in 
their very next game against Sonoma 
State. Starting off slow in the first 
half, the Seawolves scored first on a 
header off a corner kick that barely 
slipped through the grip of a diving 
McGovern.

Looking more composed and con-
fident in the second half, Belak-Berger 
streaked up the right side of the field, 
juked the Sonoma State defender, was 
tripped up in the box and earned a 

penalty kick. As one of the senior 
captains, Belak-Berger showed her 
veteran cool as she nailed the ball to 
the back of the net to tie the game at 
one each. 

With less than 10 minutes to play 
in regulation, McTigue centered a per-
fect ball to Belak-Berger, who snuck 
it by the Seawolves’ keeper for what 
proved to be the game winner.

UCSD preceded the two wins with 
an overtime loss to Cal State San 
Bernardino on Sept. 28. After playing 
a hard-fought 100 minutes, Cal State 

San Bernardino broke through with 
a golden goal in the second minute 
of the second overtime — ending 
UCSD’s four-game winning streak.

Three Triton defenders missed a 
cross by the Coyote forward and two 
touches later the ball snuck by senior 
goalkeeper Jessica McGovern for the 
winner.

 “We were disappointed because 
we knew we could have played better,” 
Belak-Berger said. 

ANDREW RICCI/GUARDIAN
Senior forward Tony Fernandez and the UCSD offense had plenty of chances, but couldn’t find 
the back of the net in a tightly contested scoreless draw against Humboldt State last Sunday.

One hundred years seemed too good to be true. One hun-dred wins seemed too good 
to be true. Unfortunately, for Cubs and 
Angels fans, the rounded digits desig-
nating years from a championship and 
a franchise-record number of wins in 
a season, respectively, were too good 
to be true. So, while Chicago and Los 
Angeles of Anaheim fans recover from 
their teams’ upset losses, the MLB play-
offs are now left without the two best 
regular-season teams. As Dane Cook 
constipatedly reminded us last year, 
there is only one October and so relying 

on what you did during that one August 
or one September or one tequila-fueled 
night in July can only take you so far.

Rays vs. Red Sox
Even with the Yankees out of the 

playoffs, the East Coast-biased media 
gets its wish with an all AL East show-
down. The Rays don’t have the same 
aura as the Yankees, but they have the 
best young lineup in baseball and play 
with more speed and energy than the 
Yanks ever showed. Joe Maddon, hav-
ing learned baseball from Angels skip-
per Mike Scioscia and coaching eye-
wear from “Little Giants” coach Rick 
Moranis, has been able to mold the 
pieces of this team to improve 31 games 
over last season. Maddon never shied 
away from placing a heavy load on 
rookie third-basemen Evan Longoria 
and was quick to discipline and defend 
outfielder BJ Upton. The Rays’ under-
dog attitude has won numerous admir-
ers over the course of the season.

In four short years, the Boston Red 
Sox have gone from being the team 
most were pulling for to a team that is 
just slightly less annoying than Frank 
Caliendo. In that time, Theo Epstein has 
been able to change the Red Sox from 
the group of self-proclaimed idiots that 
won in 2004 to possibly the first back-
to-back World Series winners since the 
Yankees. Almost motivated by a group-
held belief that they’re better off without 
Manny Ramirez (which they’re not), 
the Red Sox are no longer led by the 
swift bats of Big Papi and Manny in the 
middle of the order. Rather, it’s Jacoby 
Ellsbury and fabricated-MVP candi-
date Dustin Pedroia leading things off. 
Overall, this team does not match up 
with either the 2004 or 2007 incarna-
tions.

In the end, the Red Sox won’t have 
to face the former versions of them-
selves, but the current version of the 
Rays. Tampa Bay will try to use its 
depth and the best home-field advan-
tage in baseball this season (57-24) in 
what has developed into an increasingly 
difficult field to patrol. Unfortunately, 
the Rays are relying on a staff ace in 
Scott Kazmir that has not gone more 
than six innings since July. The Red 
Sox pitching, with Jon Lester, Daisuke 
Matsuzaka and Josh Beckett starting 
and Jonathan Papelbon serving as the 
necessary lock-down closer, provides 
them their greatest advantage, even if 
Beckett is not the same dominant force

MEN’S SOCCER — “The sport is 
like that sometimes — the best team 
doesn’t always win,” head coach John 
Pascale said after his men’s soccer 
team played to a 0-0 double over-
time draw against Humboldt State 
University on Oct. 5 at Triton Soccer 
Field. The Tritons failed to capital-
ize on numerous opportunities and 
were forced to settle with only one 
point in the finale of a four-game 
home stand. The draw, coupled with 
a 4-0 loss to Sonoma State on Oct. 3, 
leaves UCSD with an overall record 
of 6-3-2 and a California Collegiate 
Athletic Association mark of 3-3-2. 
The Tritons currently sit in fourth 
place in the CCAA South Division 
with 11 points.

The home side showed the needed 
intensity from the get-go and nearly 
netted an early score halfway through 
the first frame. Senior midfielder Joe 
Shah lined a pass to freshman for-
ward Scott Macbride, who was sit-
ting on the doorstep ready to strike. 
But Humboldt goalkeeper Drew Ryan 
made a strong play on the ball, deny-
ing Macbride an easy goal. 

After a strong first half, the Tritons 
exhibited a sense of desperation as 
they pushed and prodded in their 
attempts to get on the scoreboard. 
The squad exhibited a fluidity and 
precision in their passing game that 
had recently been lacking, creating a 
multitude of opportunities to strike. 
In the 49th minute, sophomore mid-
fielder Josh Jackson played a cor-
ner kick into the box where senior 
forward Tony Fernandez was wait-
ing. Fernandez rose above a group of 
defenders and headed the ball on tar-
get but missed just above the crossbar.

WOMEN’S TENNIS — As head 
coach Liz LaPlante gets set to start 
her 29th year, she will be greeted by 
a recruiting class that could make an 
immediate impact for the defend-
ing California Collegiate Athletic 
Association conference champions. 
Freshman Katie Mulloy, UC Davis 
transfer Anita Athavale and Hilo-
Hawaii transfer Krystal Mizuguchi 
have all caught coach LaPlante’s eye 
during preseason workouts and plan 
to do great things for the Tritons this 
season.

“We have lost three players in our 
top six and those three girls have 
looked really strong in practice,” 
LaPlante said. “They definitely have 
the potential to keep us in conten-
tion for the conference championship 
again.” 

Under LaPlante’s coaching, the 
Tritons have put together a stunning 
streak of dominance in the CCAA. 
UCSD has won 40 straight match-
es against conference foes, a streak 
that goes all the way to the team’s 
final match of 2003. That’s only part 
of LaPlante’s resume — she also led 
the team to four national titles at 
the Division-III level, as well as 26 
straight appearances in the NCAA 
tournament.

Last season, the Tritons fell to 
top-ranked BYU-Hawaii in the sec-

ond round of the NCAA Tournament. 
Expectations are higher now with 
these strong newcomers. This year’s 
team got its highly anticipated season 
going at Cal Poly Pomona for the ITA 
West Region Championships, with 
the men’s team on Oct. 2 and Oct. 3. 
LaPlante put together the lineup for 
the singles and doubles draw largely 
based on experience. She used her 
top six returning players for the sin-
gles portion. In doubles, UCSD had 
three teams and LaPlante picked her 
two most successful doubles teams 
from last year to headline the lineup.

After earning first-round byes, 
fifth-seed senior Ina Dan and eighth-
seed sophomore Cindy Dao both had 
successful season openers, earning 
impressive victories in the process. 
Dan, the only UCSD senior to partici-
pate in the tournament, kicked things 
off with a 6-2, 6-0 win over Fallon 
Blattner from Cal Poly Pomona. That 
win allowed Dan to advance on to day 
two, where she beat Lexy Harrington 
of Cal State Stanislaus 6-0, 6-2. 

In the quarterfinals, Dan had a 
showdown with top seed Heiwenfi 
Li, but couldn’t keep things close, 
losing 6-1, 6-1. Li eventually won 
the tournament without dropping a 
set. Dao, who was part of LaPlante’s 
talented recruiting class from last 
season, started off wonderfully, beat-
ing Stephanie Shelton from Western 

New Mexico 6-0, 6-0 in her first 
match. Against Sonoma State’s Molly 
Maguire, Dao was able to keep her 
game in top form, winning 6-3, 6-3 to 
advance to the third round. Dao’s run 
would come to an end in that round 
where she lost 5-7, 6-2, 6-2 to Cal 
State Stanislaus’ Vanessa Reibstein.

Anita Athavale started off her 
Triton career strong in the singles 
draw by defeating Marie-Caroline 
Legros of Grand Canyon University 
6-1, 6-0. But things got difficult in a 
hurry, as she was dealt a matchup with 
the top overall seed in the tourna-
ment in the next round. Athavale was 
overwhelmed 6-1, 6-0 by Heiwenfi Li 
of powerhouse BYU-Hawaii.

In a first-round dogfight against 
Michelle Stock of Cal Poly Pomona, 
sophomore Taskeen Bains was forced 
to retire because of an injury with the 
match on serve in the third set at 6-4, 
3-6, 1-0. Another sophomore, Valerie 
Tang, the fifth and final Triton in 
the singles draw, had a great start 
in singles play, winning both her 
matches on day one to advance to 
the final 16. Her first match against 
Stefanie Griffin of Grand Canyon 
provided few stressful moments as 
Tang breezed her way to a 6-1, 6-0 
win. 

Her next opponent, Mary Bulich 
of Sonoma State, provided only a 
little more resistance as the sopho-
more won 6-2, 6-1. Tang advanced 

to the quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-2 
win over Bojana Ducovic of Cal State 
Los Angeles, but her run would end 
there with a 6-2, 6-2 loss to Verena 
Preikschas of Cal State Stanislaus, the 
third seed.

In doubles action, LaPlante put 
Dao and Tang together for one of 
the teams. The duo earned a bye into 
the round of 16, then advanced to 
the final eight with an 8-3 win over 
Legros and Stephanie Halderman of 
Grand Canyon. In a matchup with 
BYU-Hawaii’s top-seeded team of Li 
and Jenny Chin in the quarterfinals, 
the doubles team would fall short 
with an 8-0 defeat. UCSD’s final dou-
bles team was composed of Athavale 
and sophomore Roxy Pourmirzaie.  
In their first match together, the duo 
played well but lost in the quar-
terfinals in a tough 9-7 decision to 
Stephanie Luk and Mary Bulich of 
Sonoma State. The partnership of 
Bains and Dan was unable to partici-
pate in their matches — even though 
they were the second seed — because 
of Bain’s injury.

In the coming weeks, UCSD has 
the annual Alumni Tournament on 
Oct. 8, followed by a short hiatus. The 
Tritons will return to action at the UC 
Irvine Tournament during the week-
end of Nov. 15 and Nov. 16.

Phillies vs. Dodgers
With stars Ryan Howard, Chase 

Utley and Jimmy Rollins in the infield, 
as well as the solid Jayson Werth, Pat 
Burrell and speedy Shane Victorino in 
the outfield, the Phillies should have the 
best offense in baseball. Unfortunately 
for Philadelphia, Pedro Feliz might just 
suck enough to screw everything up. 
Rollins was the MVP last season, Utley 
looked like an MVP for the first half of 
this season, Ryan Howard led the league 
in home runs and Jayson Werth should 
never have to split time again after his 
recent success. The Phillies, particularly 
Rollins, need to avoid another one of 
the slumps that plagued them during 
the season. Having won the NL East 
crown for the second year in a row, the 
Phillies now look like they have a better 
sense of what to do once they get to the 
playoffs, particularly with Cole Hamels’ 
curveball breaking like Super Cr3w.

The Los Angeles Yankees have been 
able to collect such a stable group of 
talent that future Hall-of-Famer Greg 
Maddux spends most of his time on 
the bench. Joe Torre again got the most 
out of his team and has guys like Andre 
Ethier, James Loney and Matt Kemp in 
the middle of the lineup, each poised 

for a great game at any moment. Derek 
Lowe continues to play solidly, Chad 
Billingsly is perhaps the most under-
rated pitcher in baseball and Torre just 
needs to avoid making Takashi Saito 
his Mariano Rivera and thinking David 
Ortiz switched teams every time Ryan 
Howard comes to the plate.

Ultimately, this series, just like the 
second-half of the Dodgers’ season, will 
rely on one mammoth of a man: Manny 
Ramirez. Rafael Furcal has been great 
since returning from injury and car-
ried the team at the start of the season, 
but Ramirez has changed the entire 
Dodgers dynamic. He’s crazier than OJ 
trying to get back his memorabilia, but 
in a good homeless-guy-who-comes-
to-dance-at-your-party kind of way. 
The Phillies are forced to rely on Jamie 
“Holy Shit He’s 46” Moyer, either the 
good Brett Myers or the crappy Brett 
Myers and a closer in Brad Lidge who 
has already been lit up in tough champi-
onship series situations. With one move 
the Red Sox gave the Dodgers their 
season back and changed the chemistry 
of their own team. Now it looks like 
that move might lead to one awkward 
reunion in the World Series.

Joe goes with: Dodgers in six.

Moments later the Tritons were at 
it again as Fernandez headed a ball 
forward to Macbride, who ran up the 
left side of the pitch. Macbride was 
able to control the ball and put a shot 
on goal, but was again denied by the 
keeper.

Even the defense got involved in 
the battering of the Lumberjacks’ goal-
keeper. In the 58th minute, sopho-
more defender Jared Kukura came out 
of nowhere and put a diving header on 
a ball that was played through the box, 
only to be denied like so many of his 
teammates already had been. 

Both sides had opportunities to 
go ahead throughout the remainder 
of the second half, but neither squad 
could manage to put one home and 
the match headed into overtime. The 
Tritons and the Lumberjacks defended 
extremely well in the first overtime 
period and it came and went with few 
scoring opportunities. 

The second and final overtime of 
the match saw both teams scram-
bling to secure a victory and earn 
three points in the standings. Chance 
after chance went by in the final five 
minutes, the match often seeming 
more like a video game than real life. 
Despite the offensive efforts, neither 
team could capitalize on the combined 
34 shots taken in the match, and were 
forced to settle for a draw. 

The Tritons’ offense certainly 
looked better in this match, but they 
still need to figure out how to be bet-
ter up front.

“I think it is just a matter of finding 
that last touch or last pass,” Fernandez 
said. “We need to be more of a threat 
in the attacking third.”

The draw means that UCSD has 
not scored a goal in its past three 
matches. Luckily, the Triton defense 
was back to its old ways after a tough 
couple of outings, with senior goal-

keeper Peter Akman posting his sixth 
clean sheet of the campaign.

“I think we are back on track on 
defense,” junior forward Tony Choi 
said. “We worked a lot on individual 
team defending in practice, we just 
have some minor details we need to 
focus on.”

Earlier in the weekend the Tritons 
welcomed No. 4 Sonoma State to 
Triton Soccer Field. The Seawolves are 
perennial contenders for the CCAA 
title and provided a great measur-
ing stick for UCSD. The Tritons gave 
them all they could handle deep into 
the second half, playing some great 
soccer on both sides of the pitch. 
However, the Seawolves are just too 
good to be held down for long and 
netted four goals in the last 20 minutes 
of the match to take the win. Redshirt 
freshman Ben Langwith scored twice, 
with senior Nathan Medina and junior 
Alan Grady each chipping in a goal 
apiece.  

Losing a match 4-0 is never a good 
thing, but many members of the squad 
viewed the match as a good way to 
take a step forward.

“We held them 0-0 for a long time,” 
Fernandez said. “We really felt like we 
had them on the ropes at times, you 
really felt that there was going to be a 
goal coming.”

According to Pascale, the Tritons 
have already learned from the loss.

“In large part, it was the best game 
we had all year, and we lost 4-0,” he 
said. “We were definitely a better team 
when we stepped off the field than 
when we stepped on.”

The Tritons will look to build on 
that confidence as they take to the road 
to play conference matches against Cal 
State Stanislaus and Chico State on 
Oct. 10 and Oct. 12, respectively.

Offensive Opportunities

Both teams had their chances 
throughout regulation and the first 
overtime. UCSD’s best opportunity 
came during the second half when 
freshman midfielder Shelby Wong 
put a double move on the Coyote 
defender. With only the goalie to 
beat, Wong faked right and dribbled 
the ball back left, leaving an open 
net. The ball curved off her foot and 
ricocheted off the right post with a 
demoralizing clank.

Moving into the second half 
of conference play, the Tritons are 
focused on earning a bid to the CCAA 
Championships.

“UCSD has a long tradition of 
playing well in [postseason] tourna-
ments,” Belak-Berger said. “We want 
to have a good end of the season and 
get to CCAA. To get there we need 
to be one of the top four teams in the 
conference.”

If the Tritons continue their win-
ning trend and finish atop the con-
ference standings, no travel would 
be necessary for the champion-
ship, as the CCAA Executive office 
announced Oct. 7 that UCSD will 
host the playoff tournament.

The Tritons have a long road 
ahead of them before they can com-
pete in the championship, starting 
with a three-game roadtrip begin-
ning Friday. UCSD will face Cal State 
Stanislaus on Oct. 10 and Chico State 
University on Oct. 12 before finishing 
roadtrip with a game against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on Oct. 15.
