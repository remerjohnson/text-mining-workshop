WAUKESHA, Wis. - Of all the 
factors driving voters to the polls 
next week, Republicans say they 
expect their candidate to benefit 
most from an intangible advantage: 
Republicans are far more energized 
about Gov. George W. Bush than 
Democrats are about Vice President 
AI Gore. 

There is significant evidence to 
back up that assertion by 
Republicans, including polls, voter 
interviews and observations even of 
Democrats in battleground states.

GRAND FORKS - Drug use 
in the year 2000 has taken a tum 
away from mainstream drugs such 
as marijuana, and is moving 
towards psychedelic drugs such as 
the new DXM and salvia. Drugs 
such as these are finding their way 
onto the University of North 
Dakota's campus. 

These drugs differ from the 
more common psychedelics such 
as LSD, mushrooms and ecstasy, in 
that these are being purchased

Marshall College Welcomes Trick-or-Treaters 
Valencia Park Elementary students enjoy candy and carnival in annual A.GT. event 

By PATRICK LEE 
Contributing News Writer 

Trick-o r- treating second graders from 
Valencia Park Elementary arrived at Marshall 
college Tuesday morning in an effort to eradi-
cate its candy supply. 

The trick-or-treating hoard was on campus 
as a part of the annual Active Community at 
Thurgood Marshall's Safe Halloween event, an 
outreach event th at brings inner-city school 
children to UCSD to enjoy a special Day of the 
Dead celebration . 

The event began at 10:30 a.m. with teachers 
and A.C.T. staff leading groups of 10 to 15 
candy-seeking students through the Marshall 
residence halls and the upper and lower 
Marshall apartments. The trick-or-treating gave 
way to a short lunch on Marshall field followed 
by a Halloween carnival staffed by A.C.T. 

With the help of Marshall residential advi -
sors, club members spread the word about the 
event in advance to prepare Marshall residents 
for the arrival of the trick-or-trea ters. 

"The idea is to get students involved in the 
Marshall spirit while reaching ?ut to the com-
munity: said A.C.T. co-chair Doriana Bailey. 

According to Bai ley, this event is at least five 
years old and is one of several events that A.C.T. 
sponsors throughout the year. Another such 
event is the annual "Senior" Prom, where A.C.T. 
club members visit nursing homes in the spring, 
inviting residents to dance. 

Valencia Park Elementary is a public school 
in Southeast San Diego off Skyline Boulevard. 
It is one of three schools tbat belong to the 
UCSD Friends of Learning program, from 
which the university chooses the participants of 
events such as Safe Halloween on a rotational 
basis. 

Theona Young, a second-grade teacher at 
Valencia Park, praised the event as "a day of safe 
fun ."

Recruits at UCSD 
Students can learn to manage their own 
business over the summer months 

Staff Writer 

Enthusiastic visitors pro-
claiming that students Can make 
at least $5,000 this summer 
through the Summer 
Management Program's intern-
ships are appearing in classes 
throughout campus, requesting 
phone numbers and e-mail 
addresses from interested stu-
dents. 

Brian Golder, a general man-
ager for the Summer 
Management Pro~ram says the 
summer internshIp program is 
an ideal experience for "motivat-
ed entrepreneurs· who are 
interested in heading their own 
businesses for a summer. 

Students are trained and are 
later given responsibility for hir-
ing painters, training new 
employees and eventually 
arranging their own jobs with 
clients. Golder summarized the 
programs as a ·painting intern-
ship." 

·You are responsible for 
finding the painters, getting new 
employees and booking your 
own jobs with clients,· Golder 
said. "Painting is a rejuvenating 
industry - every few years it is 
always needed." 

Golder said that students 
must be extremely diligent and 
put in long hours to reap the 
benefits of the internship. 

Speaker Addresses 
Crimes of Identity Theft 
National expert says the crime is among 
the nation's top concerns . 
ByAUXUI 
Associate News Editor 

Identity Theft Resource Center 
Director Linda Goldman-Foley 
spoke ·at an identity theft work-
shop on Thesday at the Women's 
Center. 

A nonprofit, grant-funded pro-
gram, ITRC works to serve two 
functions : assisting victims of 
identity theft and increasing pub-
lic awareness about the crime. The 
organization was founded late last 
year by Goldman-Foley, a victim 
of identity-theft herself. 

Considered nationally an 
expert in the subject, Goldman-
Foley has traveled across the 
United States in addition to testi-

-fying before courts at the state and 

federal levels and in front of 
Congress. 

The workshop was sponsored 
by the Women 's Center and 
Student Legal Services_ It served 
as a forum for discussing the 
impact of identity theft as well as 
preventative measures for 
decreasing the risk of becoming a 
victim. 

Goldman-Foley alluded to a 
recent WASHINGTON POST 
poll that showed that the biggest 
area of concern for Americans is 
privacy and identity theft. The 
issue ranks higher than terrorism, 
the economy or any other nation-
al problem. 

These concerns are reasonable,

Technology Questionable in Classroom 
UNIVERSITY PARK 

Technology is taking over the class-
room at rapid speed, but electronics 
are seen by some as an obstacle to 
creative and interactive learn:ng. 

Teachers are utilizing computers, 
projectors and videos to help them 
present their material to the class. 
However, many teachers and stu-
dents have differing views of 
whether or not technology is the 
beneficial route to learning. 

Tim Robinson teaches first-year 
seminar classes at Pennsylvania 
State University and believes that 
technology is essential to the learn-
in g process. 

"Students in my classes need to 
know how to use Web searches, 
how to make their own Web pages 
and know how to make PowerPoint 
presentations,· Robinson said. 

Robinson feels that it is worth 
spending the hours creating a pre-

sentation with Microsoft 
Power Point with a huge class 
because once the presentation is 
saved, it can be re-used another 
year. 

As a teacher, Robinson feels that 
some things can't be explained in 
stick figures. He believes that seeing 
the material visually helps almost 
everyone. 

A professor of meteorology, 
Alistair Fraser's views are different 
than Robinson as he thinks that 
professors don't use technology in 
the proper way. 

"Technology has the potential to 
be helpful to students, but some 
professors don't use it that way,' 
Fraser said. 

Although he was instrumental in 
supplying projectors in the Walker 
Building classrooms and uses com-
puters as visual interactive models 
to show students, for example, how

Halloween: 
Children got to trick-or-
treat in safety ConU._ froIIII ..... 1 
formance by "Eminem: 

The Safe Halloween carnival 
featured a variety of ·games and 
activities like Pin- the-wart-on-
the:witch and scary story telling. 

Although most of the children at 
the event planned to be trick-or-
treating Halloween night as weli, 
the A.C.T. safe Halloween gave 
them an opportunity to do so in 
the safety of a college campus 
during the daytime. For many 
children this is the first exposure 
they have had to a university. 

"It's a pretty place, but it's a 
long walk," second grader Macio 
Liller said. 

clouds grow, he feels that not all 
technology is designed for the class-
room. 

"The PowerPoint was not made 
for students or faculty, it was made 
for the business community," Fraser 
said. 

On the other . hand, Rachel 
Scheer ijunior-geography) said that 
technology is essential in her 
Geography 121 (Mapping) class. 
"Without technology, I don't think 
that I would learn half as much. The 
class is very hands on, and it makes 
learning easier," Scheer said. 

Scheer's professor for the class 
puts all of the lectures on the Web, 
which makes listening easier in the 
classroom, she said. Because the 
professor takes attendance, Scheer 
said that she doesn't feel that the 
anendance rate suffers at all.

"Car Accident Victims Get A 
Crash Course On Their Rights!" 
San Diego, CA. - A new free report has recently been released 
that reveals information every car accident victim should have 
before they speak to anyone. Research shows that even a "fender 
bender" can cause poin, headaches, even arthritis. Many car 
accident victims worry more about their car than they do their 
rights. If you have been involved in an auto accident listen to the 
24 hour toll -free recorded message by calling 1-888-244-5936. 
The call is free and so is the report.

Bush's Campaign 
Strategies Prove 
Succesful 

In the past several weeks, most polls have 
written off the idea of Gov. George W Bush 
winning California. Vice Pr~sident Al Gore 
had, for most of the campaign season, held a 
substantial lead over Bush in this state, even 
with Ralph Nader contending. Recently, 
however, under the barrage of television ads, 
the lead that Gore had once taken for grant-
ed has now dwindled. Gore, on the other 
hand, "has yet to spend a dime on ads here," 
as the Wall Street Journal states. By swiping 
California from under Gore's nose, Bush 
could rack up 54 Electoral College votes 
and, with it, the presidential election. 

More troubling to Gore are the states 
north of California. While Gore still leads in 
the Golden State, Oregan and Washington 
are considered integral swing states. And he 
is slowly losing ground there. Thanks to a 
devious television blitz by Bush supporters-
some polls even show the Vice President 
losing these important states. 

The Guardian cannot help but to congrat-
ulate Bush and his supporters for their tact-
ful, if a bit Machiavellian, campaign strate-
gies. Bush has continued to show his 
resilience in California, and it has paid off. 
Just yesterday, Bush and John McCain were 
in Fresno and Burbank campaigning. 
"There's going to be a lot of shocked people 
on Nov. 7, including my opponent ... ," Bush 
said yesterday. Perhaps he might be correct. 

Gore has only recently decided to visit 
California. Perhaps this shows his cam-
paign's inefficiency. Only now, after the 
prospect of losing California has he decided 
to come to Los Angeles tomorrow, his first 
visit to this state in more than six weeks. 

There has yet to be a presidential election 
in recent memory in which the winner has 
not taken California and its 54 votes, more 
than any state in the nation. Perhaps now, 
politicians will begin to take California seri-
ously. 

In the much smaller states of Oregon and 
Washington, the same reality faces Gore. 
The televison ads the Bush supporters are 
running do not mention the name "Bush" at 
all. Rather, the ads are endorsements for 
Nader. Gore is not leading by a large margin, 
and the votes that Nader pulls away from 
him can tip the states to Bush's favor. And, 
for the most part, it seems to be working. 

Though the Guardian has yet to decide 
whom to endorse, Bush's strategies deserve 
applause.

Paradox in American Political Arena 
'Exists In Absense .of a True Leader 

Although Americans could benefit from the prescence of a charismatic political 
leader, the chance that he or she would be accepted is very slim 

By SIMONE SANnNI 
Senior Staff Writer 

One of the characters of Antonio 
Tabucchi's novel "Sostiene Pereira; set 
in Portugal in the early years of the 
Salazar regime, says something to the 
effect of this: Democracy and egalitarian-
ism are good for the British and the 
Americans, but we are Latin, and all we 
need is a leader that we can follow and 
love. 

My Latin eye looks at these words 
with a sad comprehension, but my 
American eye looks at them with a cer-
tain satisfaction, 

These words come back to my mind 
every time I hear somebody - especial-
lyon Tv, it seems - talk about the crisis 
of leadership in this country, and how 
the next president should not really be 
competent in this or that but should only 
posses that ineffable "leadership" quality, 
statements of which everybody seems to 
know the meaning except me. 

While this kind of talk appears to be 
rather productive for one George W. 
Bush - well-known not to be competent 
in any area of human knowledge, except 
maybe in the ineffable ones like "leader-
ship" - to claim that leadership was 
invented by Bush 's campaign would 
probably be going too far. The leadership 
issue has been around a lot longer than 
the Bush candidacy. 

In front of this wave of followers' love 
in search of a target, I would like to pro-
pose the observation that, if there is one 
thing that America does not want, it is a 
leader. In truth, it seems like Americans 
are at their best when they are deprived 
of a leader or when they consciously 
reject one. Examples of this rule can be 
found in such disparate areas that I 
would propose it as general, but for the 
time being, I will limit it to political argu-
ments. 

The American political tradition is a 
mix of declared pride in its form of gov-
ernment and substantial distrust o( the 
same government. This is a cultural 
point of departure for America from its 

I would like to propose the 
observation that, if there is 
one thing that America does 
not want, it is a leader: In 
truth, it seems like Americans 
are at their best when they 
are deprived of a leader or 
when they consciously reject 
one. 

European origins and, as such, one of 
the points that characterizes the 
American experience. 

In Europe, especially in very dirigible 
countries like Prance, the government is 
not just expected to administer the ser-
vices, but also to set the moral and cul-
tural tone of society. Americans do not 
expect this from their government arrd 
have been known to strongly oppose any 
proposal in this direction. 

In other words, Americans do not 
want their government or their presi-
dent (who is the most visible embodi-
ment of the government) to be a leader 
of society, just a good administrator. I 
will not comment on this attitude. I 
think it has advantages and disadvan-
tages but debating them would take me 
too far. I will just take note of the fact 
that this is what most Americans see as 
'the role of the government and their 
president. 

Even if Americans do not specifically 
call for a leader, how does the political 
system adjust to the presence of one? Ln 
the past, presidents exercised strong 
leadership on a number of occasions. In 
many of these instances, such exercise 
went - in the short run, at least -
a,gainst the opinions of a large part of the 
population . The end of slavery was 
strongly opposed by the agricultural 
Southern establishment, political sup-
port to the civil rights movement was 
opposed by many people in Southern 

states, and women's suffrage was 
opposed by, well , men. 

These social innovations were even-
tually accepted by the majority but, at 
the time in which they were hot topics, 
all conservatives and a lot of moderates 
opposed them. Leadership is the capaci-
ty to go against such strong opposition 
and get away with it. 

Given these characteristics, what are 
the chances that a truly charismatic 
political leader would be accepted in the 
current political climate? Very slim at 
best. The public opinion is more and 
more uniform and directed toward 
acquiescence to the status quo, and in 
recent years we have seen the emergence 
of a fast mechanism by which public 
opinion can be coalesced and fed back to 
the political class. 

To resist this constant pressure from 
the public opinion and the polls would 
indeed require a person of uncommon 
characteristics; somebody willing to risk 
political suicide to defend certain princi-
ples. Unfortunately, these are not the 
characteristics that would lead one to 
electoral victory, 

An example of this attitude is the sin-
gular 'fate of Bill Clinton. Probably the 
most intelligent and charismatic presi-
dent in 40 years, his first attempt to use 
his leadership capacity, the ill-fated 
health care reform of 1993-1994, gener-
ated a nationwide commotion against 
him to the point that he has had to fight 
an uphill battle for the rest of his two 
terms, 

America is therefore caught in a dou-
ble impossibility. On one hand, its cul-
tural heritage and political structure 
make it diffident to excessive leadership; 
a softer distribution of power is pre-
ferred . This distribution is breaking 
down into several important points, but 
that is a topic for a diff!!rent column. 

On the other hand, the characteristics 
of the electoral process generate an 
incompatibility between the personal 
qualities of a leader and those necessary

Thursday, November 2, 2000 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

Author Makes Unsuc:cesful Bid for Success Retiring Member of UCSD deserves commendation 
Student decries self-help books as a waste of money and time ule showing us a campus that has 

grown up in 40 years to be a school 
that, at its current level of maturtty, 
is not recognizable to me, 

DIVYA RUNCHAl 
I am a paranoi(t insecure, 

procrastinating. illogical student. 
I'm also poor. It may be due to 
the fact that I spend all my hard-
earned money buying self-help 
books that I think will solve my 
problems but miraculously 
always fail. 

_ I have always been a sucker 
for shows like "Oprah" and "The 
View;" shows that promise to 
help you "remember your spirit" 
and reawaken your inner god-
dess. 

Something about the sappy 
music and the spiritually awak-
ened guests always hits right 
where it huns: in the wallet. 

I' go off and buy the latest 
book to hit the self-help stands 
so I can A) organize my time bet-
ter, B} learn to be happy even 
though my grades are failing and 
I still haven't kissed a guy and, C) 
discover God in everything from 
hair gel to toilet paper. 

My friends think I'm nuts. 
More than $200 later, I am still as 
bitter and unorganized as before. 
I've perused through the books of 
the granddaddy of self-help, Dale 
Carnegie, I've highlighted the 
prose of Anthony Robbins, I have -. 
even memorized some of the 
spiritual laws of the enlightened 
[kepak Chopra to no success. 

Oh, sure, it works for a few 

days, even weeks at the most. Yet, 
myoid self comes creeping back 
to me with a velocity of immea-
surable force, and suddenly, 
Divya, the rational, articulate a.nd 
organized girl, transforms !Ike 
Dr. Jekyl into Mr. Hyde, and the 
dream of an improved me 
bl!comes dust. 

Alright, I'll admit that last 
sentence was a bit dramatic, 

The fact is, self-help 
books do very little if 
you are already a little 
loony from the 
beginning. 
Unfortunately, it has 
taken me a few 
Benjamins to poinrme 
in the right direction. 
which makes m~ recall that exag-
gerating situations is highly 
frowned upon by the self-help 
community. 

I've come to realize how diffi-
cult it is to not "stress the small 
stufF when small things like 
banging your baby toe against a 
door or having uneven eyebrows 
due to a bad waxing experience 
are actually quite annoying. 

OK. maybe Buddha may have 
found it easy to be able to achieve 
an enlightened sense of being 
every day, but I doubt he would 
have been too happy if he had 
two midterms, a paper and next 

month's rent looming in front of 
him. In fact, I think he would 
have been downright irritated if 
he had to dodge crazy San Diego 
drivers and try to say a mantra at 
the same time. 

Come to think of it, I don't 
think Oprah or Dr, Schlessinger 
would be able to maintain a 
higher consciousness if their 
shows were about to be canceled. 

The fact is, self-help books do 
very little if you are already a lit-
tle loony from the beginning. 
Unfortunately, it has taken a few 
Benjamins to point me in the 
right direction . 

Perhaps it may be better if I 
just accept my inadequacies, I 
realize it may be better to be 
imperfect yet still unique. 

And who needs to be on time 
everytime, excluding firefighters 
and paramedics of course. 

I may as well accept my char-
acter flaws as quirks instead of 
weaknesses, although I'm sure 
my future husband would have a 
few problems with that. 

Just in case self-help books 
work though, I have a back-up 
plan. Stashed in my car, along-
side a cell phone for emergency 
uses, I have a copy of the "Seven 
Habits of Highly Effective 
People"carefully placed in my 
car. 

I've skipped chapters one 
through four, but I think I may 
still glean something important 
from the remaining few. ' 

Of course I wouldn't be so 
dumb as to mention this to my 
therapist. I don't think he would 
be too happy to hear that.

Editor: 
I would like to relate a story of 

commitment and service by an out-
standing retiring member of the 
UCSD community. As time was 
approaching to take a campus tour 
for what would likely be my last 
time with Larry Barrett, I realized 
how long I had known ,him and 
how gracious he had been over 
those 25 years. 

My daughter Jackie, a high 
school senior, invited herself along 
to see my alma mater and poten-
tially hers. Larry spent almost an 
entire day out of his hectic sched-

I was one of his first student 
interns in 1976 in the housing and 
food administration department at 
UCSD. The campus had approxi-
mately 10,000 students then, 
whereas today it has over 20,000 
students. 

He went on to explain to my 
daughter that had it not been for 
his prodding, I might arguably have 
taken more time £9 graduate than I 
did, It was difficuft to leave such a 
beautiful beach resort like La Jolla, 
Two of my sisters and a brother-in-
law all came into contact with 
Larry over the years and all we~e 
received by him and aided by hiS 
generosity of time and expertise as 
they pursued their educations at 
UCSD. 

As I see the regentrification and 
the metamorphosis of UCSD to a 
world-class university, . I cannot 
help but think of how much Larry 
has played a part in this process. 
Food and housing for LIS as new 
university students are the 
lifeblood of our collective existence 
as we separate from our families for 
the first time to proceed toward 
this new path of exploration that 
we collectively term the college 
experience. For me, he was an 
adviser in tough times and a coach 
in others, but fundamentally, he 
was a guidepost throughout. 

As the years rolled on, and each 
of my subsequent visits to the cam-
pus allowed me to see the new 
challenges that Larry and the uni-
versity had, to meet, I could see he 
had met each with creative solu-

McCain Pushes for Reform Letters his right to feel angry at the "imbal-ance" in Christianity when com-pared to religious groups, although 
it is not numbers that cause unbal-
ance but the amount of heart we 
put into it. (Actually, I took it as a 
complement that he believed 
Christianity to be more represented 
than any religious group on cam-
pus, because I do not think the low

so much.)

By DAVID ZOlTAN 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

A short while ago, the Balkans 
were in dire circumstances. This 
geopolitically important region , 
the area where World War I began, 
experienced an oppressive dicta-
torship, civil war, genocide and a 
late international community 
response, among other injustices. 

Finally, the people of Serbia 
were given the opportunity to par-
ticipate in a free general election. 
They were able to voice their 
opinions on the government's 
organization and operation - or 
so they believed. Slobodan 
Milosovic, however, denied his 
people this privilege by suppress-
ing the results of the election and 
scheduling a run-off election. 

The people decided to take the 
government by force and throw 
Milosovic out of office. These 
actions should provide us with the 
inspiration to get involved in our 
political affairs. 

Shortly, American citizens, too, 
will have the opportunity to get 
involved in their country's politi-
cal process. In the upcoming elec-
tions, the people of the most pow-
erful nation in the world will be 
given the honor and opportunity 
to decide who will lead this coun-
try and the rest of the world in the 
next century. There has not been 
an election this important in the 
nation's history since the election 
of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 
1930s. Yet, this will probably be 
th e election with the lowest 
turnout in recorded history. 

This disconcerting and sad-
dening thought should weigh 

L IMITED 

deeply on the American public. In 
this country, there simply does 
not exist an interest in politics and 
national or international affairs. 
Why should a country with such a 
strong democratic institution and 
secure civil liberties have such a 
low level of citizen interest in its 
political process? 

The answer is that the gov-
ernment has pushed the people 
away. The people fee l as if they 
really do not have any say in the 
way their government operates. 
The powerful interest groups 
and multibillion dollar indus-
tries, by buying the necessary 
access to the levers of powers, 
really control this country. 
However, there is hope. 

At the beginning of the year, 
during the Republican primaries, 
there existed an astonishing 
amount of interest in politics. 
Most amazing of all was the 
involvement of the youth, primar-
ily college students. The figure 
who captured this nationwide 
attention was Sen. John McCain 
with his campaign finance reform 
agenda, found in the McCain-
Finegold Bill. 

This bill proposes to reform 
the manner in which candidates 
receive their political contribu-
tions. If passed, it will put an end 
to soft money donations, which 
allow undisclosed and unlimited 
contribution amounts. Soft 
money allows wealthy industries 
or individuals to have a large and 
dominant voice. If this bill passes, 
there would be an acceptable 
maximum contribution from each 
source, which would have to be 
declared. This way, the 'American 

S EATING -

public would know which organi- . 
zations and individuals support 
each candidate. 

For the first time in a long 
while, the American people saw 
the potential to cause change in 
the selection of their leaders and 
to empower themselves by dis-
empowering special interests. 
The basis for a political revolu-
tion was set in place. For the first 
time in this country's history, 
someone dared to challenge the 
system and had the opportunity 
to sneak in and take the election 
away from the mainstream candi-
dates. 

By preaching campaign finance 
reform and inspiring the nation's 
youth, including me, McCain cre-
ated many enemies for himself. 
Career politicians and important 
business figures distanced them-
selves from this radical maverick, 
who always speaks his mind 
regardless of popular response 
and who preaches absurdities that 
could destroy the very fabric of 
their way of living. How else 
would politicians raise money and 
secure their re-election if it were 
not .for the elite buying access? 
More importantly, how else would 
the elite monopolize the voice in 
the decisions made for the benefit 
of this country? 

America's youth were inspired 
and motivated by this man and his 
personal quest to restructure the 
government. His actions spurred a 
desire to rid ' this country of its 
cynicism and lack of interest in 
·politics. It became popular to care 
and take an active interest in po Ii-

tions. As I neared the end of our 
campus tour, I began to realize the 
magnitude of the people he had 
come in contact with and had 
impacted over his 3S years of ser-
vice. 

As I reflect on the trail that 
Larry leaves behind with this great 
university, I realize what a great 
leader and devoted public servant 
UCSD is losing. May we, as alumni 
and current students, be so fortu-
nate to find someone to replace 
Larry that is as genuine and devot-
ed as he has been to this university, 
my family and me? Thank yo~ 
Larry, we will miss your class, style 
and leadership.

I am sorry that your writer 

Arnel Guiang is so passionately 
against Christianity on this cam-
pus. I can understand how the 
invitations to Christian events 
could be overwhelming to some-
one who is not a Christian. 

His point of view seems to be 
that of an individual who is m~rely 
annoyed by Christian pressure. It is 

I wanted also to explain to him, 
on a more personal basis, that 
spreading the good news of Jesus is 
my job as a Christian. I know how 
wonderful it is to be in communion 
with God because of Jesus' sacrifice 
to us on the cross: 

God has a plan for my life. He 
loves me more than I can imagine; 
He provides for me and He 
strengthens me. In my kno,!\,ing 
that all people in this world can 
also have that rela'tionship with 
God, how could I possibly be so 
selfish as to hold myself back 
from spreading the good news of 
Jesus? 

Not meaning to offend him or 
belittle his personal beliefs, I would 
like to suggest that he give 
Christianity a chance. We should 
all be given the chance to rightly 
accept or reject the beliefs of oth-
ers, so instead of passing up those 
opportunities of joining the "cru-
sade; see for sure if Christianity is 
nothing more than an obstacle, 
rather than a path to life. 

Our passion comes from God 
and the validity of Christianity.

Even among them, AI Gore will

George W. Bush has lied about 
pretty much everything during the 
campaign, but these lies are per-

rance and, incredibly, this fact 
makes him appealing and might

tics. 

McCain, however, still fights on 
in the Senate for his great cause. 
While be has had some success in 
the Senate passing bills while en 
route to his ultimate goal, he still 
has a long road ahead of him. 

The candidacy of Vice President 
·AI Gore, although his party and 
McCain's stand at odds, offers 
some hope for McCain's vision. 
Gore has vowed to make campaign 
finance reform a strong and imme-
diate priority in his agenda if elect-
ed to office. He will support a 
major portion, if not all of the 
McCain-Finegold Bill. 

Gov. George W. Bush, however, 
has not committed anything 
toward this important legislation. 
Perhaps Bush's lack of commit-
ment stems from the fact that the 
two-party system in which he is 
entrenched is designed to silence 
people like McCain and ensure 

send him to the White House. 
Forget about a leader. Americans 
want a president they can look 
down on. 

If one accepts - at least in first 
approximation - my analysis, it is 
quite natural to wonder why the 
question of leadership capacities 
comes out so soften in the politi-
cal debate. The most obvious rea-
son is that people are seldom 
coherent. This explanation has the 
advantage to apply to everything 
but it explains pretty much noth-
ing. 

I will propose another one. It is 
a puritan belief that hard work and 
strong will bring success. But as 
we all know very well, this is not 
always the case. In this case, rather 

that they pose no threat. 
The na'ive youth, who had the 

misfortune of believing in and 
supporting a man in Washington, 
find that they were right to pro-
tect themselves with cynicism. 
Despite Bush's refusal to accept

than assuming a fatalist attitude 
more characteristic of 
Catholicism, it is often easier to 
look for somebody to blame. I 
cannot help but notice that blame 
assignment is a particularly lively 
activity in America. This is why we 
need a leader; having the power 
and the moral responsibility to 
ensure the public satisfaction, he 
will be the automatic and obvious 
target of every popular disappoint-
ment. 

Creating a leader and then 
crushing him is a lot more satisfy-

decisions that receive widespread 
public support often generate side 
effects that the same p,ublic finds

generation of voters, and disap-
pointed them. He did this by per-
petuating politics as usual. 

However, the sadder part of 
McCain's absence in the genj:l'al 
election is the simultaneous 
absence of interest in the elections, 
particularly among young voters. I

Despite this disappointment, 
there is one lesson to learn from 
the McCain campaign: One must 
voice one's opinions loudly to

especially in this election. 

Next week, the people of this 
nation will have the same opportu-
nity to participate in their govern-
ment that their Eastern European 
counterparts had. In spite of our 
disappointments, we can set aside 
our justified cynicism and achieve a 
similar level of participation, and 
hopefully trigger the passage of the

Putin's First Visit to France 
Attracts uttle Fanfare 

PARIS - It is probably unfair 
to read much into the fact that 
on the last day of the three-day 
visit here of Russia 's president. 
Vladimir Putin . President 
Jacq ues Chirac changed his 
schedule to fly to Cherbourg and 
visit the spot where a chemical 
tanker had just sank in the. 
English Channel. 

But there is no question that 
the leaky tanker was making a lot 
more headlines here than the 
president of Russia . 

That was in part due to the 
relatively low-key nature of 
Putin's fi rst visit to France, a 
country that he had snubbed 
since taking office in May 
because it was so voca l in 
denouncing Russia's war in 
Chechnya. 

Putin did go to the Elysee 
Palace to receive a salute from 
members of the Republican 
Guard in their horsehair-plumed 
cava lry hel mets. And he and 
some European Union leaders 
did issue a joint statement 
declaring that the crisi in 
Chechnya needed :j Foli tical 
solution. 

But everything else about the 
visit was qui!!t. Coverage of 
Putin's tour of the Louvre - on 
a day it was closed - and of a 
Russian cemetery in the suburbs 
was restricted to small numbers 
of photogr.aphers who found lit-

But there is no question 
that the leaky tanker was 
making a lot rrwre 
headlines than the 
president of Russia. 
tie worth recording. 

Much of Putin 's time was 
spent behind closed doors. meet-
ing business and political lead-
ers. And the protests against his 
presence were small. consisting 
of that mysterious assemblage 
usually referred to as "French 
intellectuals." 

But the visit also seemed to 
generate little fanfare because 
the Russians and French were 
clearly working at cross-purpos-
es. Putin had made it clear that 
he wanted to talk about business 

- specifically. about oil and gas. 
The French still wanted to talk 
about Chechnya. 

French and European diplo-
mats seemed willing to gloss over 
the war. After the joint statement 
in favor of a political solution 
was issued. Putin repeated at a 
news conference that there was 
"no way to negotiate with people 
with blood on their hands," a ref-
erence presumably to current 
Chechen political leadership. 

The diplomats ignored that. 
But the French press wanted to 
keep jabbing the needle in. 
When Putin showed his less icy 
side in private meetings. and 
even managed to charm a delega-
tion from the energy. banking 
and communications industries. 
the principal article on those 
meetings in the daily Liberation 
said: "In the official meetings. he 
appeared to say what those he 
met wanted to hear - an art of 
duplicity no doubt acquired at 
KGB school and his years as a 
spy."

Senate Votes to Ta~e a Recess, but 
House ·has Other Ideas 

WASHI GTO - Unable to 
reach agreement with the White 
House on crucial end-of- the-
year issues. House and Seriate 
Republicans were unable even to 
agree among themselves 
Wednesday over what to do next. 

On this confusing day exactly 
one month after the start of the 
2001 fiscal year. the Senate 
approved two stopgap spending 
bills to keep the governmen t 
operating through ov. 14. and 
then voted to recess until that 
date. 

But House Republicans. con-
cerned that the White House and 
their Elemocratic opponents in 
next week 's elections would 
chide them for leaving town 
without finishing work, refused 
fO go along with the Senate. 
Instead. they said they would 
approve temporary spending 
measures that would finance the 
government for on ly one day at a 
time. 

The net result was the 
prospect that the Senate and the 
House will have passed different 

temporary spending bills and 
that the Senate will have to 
return later this week to recon-
cile the difference. The 
Democratic minority was left 
chortling. less than a week before 
Election Day. over what it called 
Republican disarray. 

Many top Republ icans said 

"It's kind of just . 
saying: 'No one can 
push us around, no one 
can make us go home. 
We'll decide when the 
masochism is over. " 

- Pet.rlUn. 
Republican Representative 

that whatever happens later this 
week. Congress would probably 
have to return after the elections 
for a lame-duck session to com-
plete work on measures involv-

ing education and health spend-
ing. workplace safety. taxes, and 
Medicare reimbursement to hos-
pitals. nursing homes and health 
maintenance organizations. 

With the atmosphere in 
Washington so poisoned. 
Democratic and Republican 
leaders in the Senate. agreed that 
a cooling-off period was neces-
sary. 

"We need to take a timeout," 
the Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott. R-Miss .• said of the 
decision to recess for two weeks. 

That still did not sit well with 
all rank-and-file Republica ns in 
the House. 
, "It doesn't serve any purpose 
to be here. because we can't pass 
anything because the Senate's 
gone: said Rep. Peter King. a 
Republica n froln Long Island. 
: It's kind of just saying: ' No can 
push us around. no can make us 

go home. We' II decide when the

Deaths: 
No date has been set for 
defendants trial 
ContI ..... from ..... 1 

They were accused of "having 
led a canyoning trip into the Saxet 
brook in spite of the fact a thun-
derstorm was breaking over the 
Saxet valley; according to a state-
ment rel.eased by the Bern investi-
gating magistrate, Martin Trapp. 

Trapp did not name the eight 
who are accused of allowing the 
July 27. 1999. trip on the Saxet near 
the Alpine resort of Interlaken. 
even though the weather was haz-
ardous. The 45 tourists. equipped 
with life jackets and wetsuits. set off 
in four groups. As they reached the 
riverbed. a thunderstorm ·broke. 
turning the mountain stream into a 
powerful torrent that swept 18 
tourists and three guides to their 
deaths. 

The tourists. aged 18 to 31. were 
taking part in the trendy sport of 
canyoning. which involves 
rapelling down ravines. sliding 
down waterfalls. and swimming 
through rapids. Most of the victims 
were from Australia. . 

Republicans:

Republicans are united. enthusi-
astic and perhaps more likely to vote. 
not ne<:essarily because they think 
Bush is an ideal candidate but 
because they are determined to win 
back the White House after eight 
years and they share a collective 
scorn for the Clinton administra-
tion. 

Moreover. enthusiasm on the 
Democratic side has been damp-
ened because Democrats lack the 
motivation of having to take back a 
White House out of their party's 
control and are more conflicted over 
their standard bearer. Gore. 

"Republicans have an enemy: 
They hate Clinton so they're taking 
it out on Gore; said Sen. John B. 
Breaux. D-La. "If you really dislike 
the people you're running against. it 
makes it easy to get fired up." 

The Democrats' wonies about 
intensity have left the Gore cam-
paign trying to manufacture excite-
ment by sending big name enter-
tainers and Democratic luminaries 
to rallies to attract crowds and pub-
licity. 

Here in this town west of 
Milwaukee, the Gore campaign 
attracted thousands of people to a 
rally on Monday night. However. 

After the incident. Swiss 
authorities suspended all canyon-
ing. Later. they tightened rules 
governing the popular. thrill-seek-
ing draw for young people touring 
Europe. In recent years. 
Interlaken. ideally located in the 
middle of mountainous 
Switzerland. had been the center 
for such " extreme'" sports. which 
include not only canyoning but 
also paragliding. ice climbing and 
bungee jumping. 

Adventure World. a loca l com-
pany that catered successfully to a 
mostly youthful clientele. went out 
of business last May following the 
death of a American man in a 
bungee-jumping accident. An 
investigation into the death. which 
occurred when the 22-year-old vic-
tim jumped from a cable car with a 
bun gee rope that was too long. is 
still under way. 

No date has been set for the 
eight defendants' trial. which will 
take pla~e in Interlaken. Under 
Swiss law. manSlaughter through 
negligence can bring a penalty of a 
prison sentence ranging up to 
three years. or a fine up to $22.346.

introduced "the next president of 
the United States." 

"I wanted to see Bon Jovi." said 
Josh Gresl. 21. a clerk in an antiques 
store. "I wish Bon Jovi was running 
for president. Unfortunately. it is 
Gore." . 

The contrast in energy between 
Democratic and Republican parti-
sans is underscored in several polls. 
A survey released on Wednesday by 
the Pew Research Center for the 
People and the Press found that 
nearly two-thirds of Bush voters said 
they strongly supported him. while 
just over half of the Gore backers 
strongly supported their candida teo 

"Democrats should be scared to 
death that they cannot win the 
ground war the way they did in '98 
because of Democrats' lack of 
enthusiasm about Gore; said 
Andrew Kohut. director of the Pew 
Research Center. 

The Gore campaign countered 
that more undecided voters are 
women - and that the vice presi-
dent enjoys an edge among women.

Gore's positions on education."

Board Rules Graduate Assistants Have Right to Form Unions 
The National Labor Relations 

Board ruled on Wednesday for the 
first time that graduate students 
who work as research a nd teach-
ing assis tants at private COlleges 
and universities have the right to 
form unions to ~egotiate wages. 
benefits and other conditions of 
their employment. 

The ruling. in a case involving 
graduate student assis tants at 
New York University. reverses the 
board's position from the mid-
1970s. when it ruled that interns 
and residents were effectively stu-
dents and not employees and 
therefore could not unionize. 

Labor experts said that the rul-

ing on Wednesday would probably 
spur organizing efforts on many 
campuses and the formation of new 
unions. But such organizing efforts 
face obstacles. as prospective mem-
bers are only graduate students for 
a limited period and they have loy-
alties both as students and employ-
ees, said Thomas A. Kochan. a pro-
fessor at the Sloan School of 
Management at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 

"I don't expect this to set off a 
firestorm -of organizing at all of 
the top universities. but it is likely 
to have an effect at some," he said . 

Although efforts to organize 
graduate assistants in private llni-

Labor experts said that 
the ruling on Wednesday 
would probably spur 
organizing efforts on 
many campuses and the 
formation of new unions. 
versltles have been slow. union-
ization at public universities has 
increased in recent years. In many 
states, including Wisconsin. 
Michigan. California and New 
York. graduate assistants at public 
universities are already unionized, 

and efforts to unionize others are 
underway. Like government 
employees. public university grad-
uate assistants are not covered by 
the National Labor Relations Act; 
their efforts to unionize are cov-
ered under state laws. 

Officials at NYU and other 
univerSIties quickly attacked 
Wednesday's decision. saying that 
introducing collective bargaining 
into the relationship between 
graduate students and professors 
would diminish the graduate edu-
cational experience. 

"Despite what the NLRB says. 
it is virtually impossible to sepa-
rate academic decisions from the 

collective bargaining context. said 
Robert Berne vice presiden t for 
academic and health affairs at the 
university. "There is a strong risk 

.' that decisions about courses, cur-
riculum and who is going to teach 
will be decided in a collective bar-
gaining setting. diminishing the 
quality of American higher educa-
tion." NYU officials said they had 
not decided yet whether to push 
the matter into the courts. since 
they wanted to consult with stu-
dents. faculty and staff on cam-
pus.

Internship: 
Commitment generally 
begins in the spring 
CentInu ... froIII ,.,. 1 

"It's good to have had the expe-
rience of working a 40-hour 
week; Golder said. "You don't pay 
anything to be involved in the pro-
gram, but you must work hard and 
we guarantee each person a $5.000 
net profit. Basically, no one loses 
money." 

Golder also said the company 
makes money by including its 
profits into the overhead costs. 

"We make a profit because our 
profits are factored into the over-
head in each job - it's part of the 
regular business costs.w Golder 
said. "We don't make money if 
they [the students) don't make 
money." 

The Summer Management 
Program is a for-profit organiza-
tion with locations in 16 states 
and annually recruits from 100 
college ~ampuses throughout 
California. According to Golder. 
despite the large number of inter-
ested applicants numbering 
appro"imately 60.000. only about 
250 students will participate in the 
internship.

about painting, and then we set up 
a pre-interview.n Golder said. "We 
also allow the student to ask ques-
tions about us and our company 
so they become satisfied that it is 
not a scam but a full-time job. We 
make sure that they're motivated 
and we allow them to call people 
that have done the program in the 
past. 

"Ultimately. the applicants 
meet with the vice president of the 
company who will try to convince 
them not to do it; Golder said. 

Golder cites school credit as an 
incentive for students to partici-
pate. 

"Many students talk to their 
individual college and try to see 
what classes [the internship) could ' 
apply to; Golder said. 

According to Golder. the com-
mitment for many students may 
begin in the spring quarter. as they 
may try to arrange one-half of the 
painting projects before the sum-
mer starts. 

"In the summer is when the 
work starts and we're not here to 
hire painters, we're here to teach 
you to run your own business; 
Golder says. "At the end-of summer 
you can wash your hands of it.n 

Golder said he believes the 
Summer Management Program is 
a way for undergraduates to distin-
guish themselves from their class-
mates.

Crimes: 
There are two types of 
identity theft 
ContInued froIII ..... 1 

according to Goldman-Foley. She 
says the reason it has become a 

. major crime is because of the ease 
in committing the crime. 

Goldman-Foley said that identi-
ty theft is the one of the fastest ris-
ing crimes in the United States 
today. Perpetrators prey on every-
day transactions that require the 

sharin~ of personal information. 
including bank and credit card 
account numbers, one's income, 
Social Security number. address 
and phone numbers, to name a few. 

Identity thieves co-opt a piece 
of a victim's personal information 
and use it without the victim's 
knowledge to commit fraud or 
theft. One of the most common 
examples of this is when a thief 
uses a victim's personal informa-
tion to open a credit card account 
in the victim's name without their 
knowledge. 

According to Goldman-Foley. 
there are two types of identity 
theft: financial and criminal. 
Financial identity theft occurs 
when an impostor takes a victim's 
information and uses it for their 
own financial gain . Criminal 

~ Siege: 
I 

identity theft occurs when an 
impostor commits crime under 
someone else's identity. usually 
with the aid of a fake driver's 
license. 

One of the themes of the dis-
cussion was how no person is 
immune from becoming a victim. 
ITRC statistics show that most 
victims don't find out about the 
crime until 14 to 16 months after 
the crime has occurred. 

Goldman-Foley elaborated on 
her own experience as a victim 
and the trauma most victims go 
through. 

"Most victims of identity theft 
go through the same range of 
emotions as someone who has 
been a victim of violent crime or 
even rape." Goldman-Foley said. 
"There's denial and a sense of '1 
did something wrong; this is my 
fault,'" 

She went on to say that vic-
tims experience a very deep sense 
of personal violation because of 
the nature of the crime itself. 

"You're trying to prove that 
you haven't done something; 
Goldman-Foley said. "Isn't it our 
justice system that says you are 
innocent until proven guilty? 
Identity theft is just the opposite. 
it's '1 am guilty until I prove my 
innocence,'" 

Students are affected by iden-
tity theft crimes as well. Students 

NEWS 9 

need to be aware of any false 
reports on their credit histories. 
Since college students are at an 
age when most credit card com-
panies are vying for their atten-
tion. students are easy targets for 
identity theft criminals. 

Goldman-Foley stressed that 
victims come in all ages, even 
referring to one case in which the 
victim was a 4-year-old . 

"It's not how old you are or 
how much money you have." 
Goldman-Foley said. "It's the 
credit that they want." 

It is not unlikely for criminals 
to be victims' family members or 
friends. Goldman-Foley said . In 
her case. it was her employer who 
stole her identity. 

Goldman-Foley said that the 
following preventative measures 
would help in decreasing the risk of 
becoming a victim: Carefully 
destroy papers you don't need. 
preferably with a shredder; guard 
your Social Security Number; 
check your credit report once a 
year; block your name from mar-
keting lists; guard your personal 
information by carrying as little as 
possible in your wallet. especially 
extra credit cards; be suspicious of 
telephone solicitors; and lastly. 
demand that businesses you fre-
quent take good care of your infor-
mation and find out how they pro-
tect you from ID theft.

Universi!y of Wisconsin Organization 
Helps IMixed Kids' Come Thgether 

MADISON - When it comes to race, the 
University of Wisconsin Undergraduate Office 
of Admissions allows its students to check 
only one box. 

Yet just below the admissions office, on the 
second floor of the Multicultural Student 
Center in the Red Gym, 30 students gather 
twice a month to celebrate one important fact 
in their lives - that there are not enough 
boxes to cover the entire world. 

The students are as varied as Crayola 
crayons - no black or white, but an assort-
ment of fascinating mixtures as varied as 
black-Chinese, Peruvian-white, Japanese-
Norwegian and other backgrounds that are, as 
UW-Madison senior Zach Maul said, "about 
everything you could possibly imagine." 

Such diversity is the backbone of Students 
from Lives of Intersecting Cultures and 
Environments, a new multiethnic organization 
that Maul and roommate Jason Thompson, 
another UW-Madison senior, helped put 
together last month to address minorities

Little is known about the use of DXM and

http://salvia.lycaeum.org was the most informed 
source for the drug salvia. 

The first of these new drugs, dex-

"SLICE is a community for multiethnic 

students, those who feel they are from non-
traditional cultures and adopted students who 
have a different racial background as their par-
ents," Maul said. "[t's more or less a social 
group just so us 'mixed-kids' don 't feel left 
out." 

Maul, who is Chinese-German, said he 
never fit into any of the established "tradition-
al ethnic groups' on campus, since they were 
only geared to a single race or ethnicity. 

"Back when 1 was a freshman , biracial peo-
ple didn't have a place to go; blacks had their 
black parties, Korean-Americans had their 
hangouts, but we were left out of the picture." 

Through SLICE, Maul and Thompson are 
part of a new community of mu[tiethnic stu-
dents who discuss a wide array of multiethnic 
issues -including campus race relations, the 
color barrier and conventional norms of iden-
tifying race.

it is pharmacologically unlike most recre-
ational drugs, because its closest relatives are 
phenylcyclohexyl piperidine and ketamine. 

Although information about DXM has 
only surfaced recently, according to a DXM 
Web site it has been popular as an "under-
ground' drug for 30 years. It has also found 
its way to parties at UND this year. 

"I took 700 mg of the powder DXM," a 
UND student said, whose name for the pur-
poses of protection of privacy will be with-
held. "The intensity of the 'trip' lasted abollt 
four hours, but 1 cou ld feel the presence of 
the drug in my body for about 20 hours after 
taking it." 

The effects of DXM can differ from per-
son to person, causing anything from mild 
euphoria to "full mind and body disassocia-
tion; as described by a user. 

"My friend did the same amount as 1 did," 
a UND junior said. "He could hardly walk, 
and was talking to trees and vomiting. He 
swore he would never do it again."

INSIDE Album Reviews Calendar Film Review • • • 

I nterestingly enough, Friday night's concert may prove to be the university'S best of the year. This is one of 
those rare jewels in the rough that 
should restore some confidence in 
A.S. Programming for those tired of 
seeing, oh, say, Wyclef Jean or Black 
Eyed Peas for the umpteenth time. 
And the best part - the show is free. 

The concert will open up with a 
3D-minute session from select mem-
bers of the DJs and Yinylphiles Club 
and will then jump into Lost at Last, 
an "ethno/techno' fusion group. The 

12 12 

concert's location - outdoors in the 
Price Center Plaza - creates a perfect 
backdrop for the featured fire 
dancers, video projection effects and a 

s~pp0r:ting cast of musicians adorned . 
With tribal body paints. It's eye candy 
for the masses, a mini-Burning Man 
pulsing in the heart of campus. With 
the snowballing tension between the 
Palestinians and Israelis abroad and in 
our backyard, the concert has been 
dedicated to a hope for peace between 
these two peoples. Boom. A concert 
with a message. 

But it doesn 't end with a couple of 

13 

Beastie Boys calling for peace and 
then popping out five radio versions 
of "Brass Monkey." Lost at Last is one 
of those groups that is as interesting 
to read about as it is to listen to. 

The band formed in Maui and 
debuted its self-titled album at a 
venue on the slopes of Haleakala, a 
10,OOO-foot dormant volcano. The 
three founding members - program-
mer and keyboardist Om, instrumen-
talist Deva Priyo and singer Jaya Lak-
shmi - enjoyed sellout performances 
on the islands, but wanted to take 
their message to the mainland.

"[t soon became clear that we 
needed to depart these peaceful 
shores, [so that) many more people 
could be part of the Lost at Last expe-
rience; said band manager Randy 
NikJason . 

Lost at Last made a second home 
in Northern California as their eclec-
tic electronic style appealed to San 
Franciscans. They eventually carved 
out a musical niche that they called 
"planet hop." But it takes a little more 
to pinpoint their unique sound.

Crush Down 
Like This 

MeA Records 

c 

Sometimes an album cannot be 
analyzed too deeply because it will 
appear shallow and superficial. 
Such is the case for "Like This: 
Crush Down's debut album. Its 
heavy guitar riffs and solid vocals 
make the album just bearable, but 
one listen to the lyrics is enough to 
make the listener cringe. 

The title track is a well-crafted 
hard rock song, but its trivial mean-
ing is made obvious with lines such 
as "You leave me higher than a 
whore." Another song sounds like a 
young adult romance novel, as lead 
singer Justin Raymond sings, "Pain, 
it's a taker, when you 're breakin' up 
and you know it's over." It's almost 
as if the band is anticipating the 
negative response to its album, as 
Raymond sings, "I'm so transparent 
.. . and all the critics increase my 
dosage," in "Patch ." 

Raymond's elastic voice resem-
bles Stone Temple Pilots' singer 
Scott Weiland's on some tracks, but 
the quality of Crush Down 's music 
does not even come close to that of 
STP. This band dOes not have any 
trouble busting out energetic, dis-
tortion-filled tracks, but its lack of 
depth makes its music sound as 
hollow as bubblcgum rock. 

- Brenda Xu 

Black Eyed Peas 
"Bridging the Gap" 

Interscope 

B+ 
All the great ones have a signa-

ture sound. The Black Eyed Peas 
return with a vengeance on their 
second album, "Bridging the Gap," 
blazing out their unique mix of hip 
hop, trip hop, drum 'n' bass and 
jungle. 

BEP's sophomore project flows 
with a stronger club beat, promot-
ed by contributions by Gang 
Starr's DJ Premier and Wyclcf Jean . 
But, apLde.ap and wilLi.am from 
BEP have been the dominant 
forces beh i nd the rest of the 
album's boards. Funky breaks and 
old-school samples from party 
favorites line each track with a 
dance groove missing from their 
debut album, "Bridging the Front." 

Their first commercial release, 
"Weekend ," evidences this dance 
push by capturi ng Debbie Deb's 
'80s smash "Lookout Weekend." 

"On this album," wilLi.am said, 
"we intended the songs to be 
played in clubs because we dub 

motherfuckers. We wanted that 
umph. When we toured our last 
time, a lot of our songs we played 
on tour didn't register live. The 
recorded version is different. On 
this album, every single song that's 
on it, when we play it, it's like the 
way it transforms on stage is ener-
getic enough to play it live." 

BEP takes the hybridization of 
hip-hop to another level, blending 
in classical Spanish guitar licks 
with an all-star guest lineup, rang-
ing from Jurassic 5's Chali 2na to 
pop/R&B sensation Macy Gray. 

"Bridging the Gap" rings true to 
its name by showcasing BEP's on-
stage presence and flare, which 
seemed to have been missing from 
their debut. Look for this album to 
shoot mainstream hip-hop away 
from "trailer trash" rap back to its 
soulful. urban roots.

Limp Bizkit 
Chocolate Starfish and the Hot 

Dog Flavored Water 
Interscope 

13+ 

Riding on an endless wave of 
rock/rap acts, Limp Bizkit is the 
best at keeping judges pleased with 
their raw intensity and blend of 
eclectic hip- hop. After two albums 
with this same formula, the band's 
newest "Chocolate Starfish and the 
Hot Dog Flavored Water" tastes 
like everything they've cooked for 
us before. 

This record slices with a sonic 
chainsaw that encourages heavy-
knuckle moshing. Wes Borland's 
usual, bloody seven-string power 
chords adorn most of the tracks, 
and the trippy soundscaping of DJ 
Lethal form the driving beats, 
reminding you who you're listen-
ing to. Basically, if you didn't like 
Limp Bizkit before, you're not 
going to like them now. 

Head-banging tracks like "My 
Generation" force their way 
through listeners' heads like a 
deafening tornado, while songs like 
the syrupy "My Way" helps even 
out the latter part of the album 
with its steady rhythmic bumps 
and Fred Durst's well-balanced 
rhymes. 

Fans will rave about the band's 
somewhat offensive third outing, 
and once again, Limp Bizkit proves 
that they can still belt out hits that 
snarl like an untamed beast. Wood-
stock '01, anyone?

By CHARUE THAN 
Sen;or Staff Writer 

If life were a game of golf, then 
it is the perfect swing within 
everyone that helps play the 
game. "The Legend of Bagger 
Vance" tries to tie golf to life in 
similar fashion to other films 
such as "The Natural" and "Field 
of Dreams." Whereas those films 
have. a strong plot with under-
standable characters. "Bagger 
Vance" has neither the depth of 
character nor mysticism that 
define a great sports movie. 

Adele Invergordon (Charlize 
Theron) is in financial trouble as 
her deceased father leaves her 
with a debt-ridden but fabulous 
golf course in Savannah. In order 
to promote the course, Adele cre-
ates a golf tournament between 
two golf greats, but the local busi-
nessmen will not sponsor the 
tournament without a local play-
er: -

The only person that can fill 
that role is Rannulph Junuh 
(Matt Damon), a former amateur 
champion who has lost his touch 
after returning from war. Not 
only has Junuh lost his passion 
for the game of golf, but he aban-
dons his girl, Adele. 

Junuh enters the tournament 
even though he has lost his 
swing. Practicing his broken 
swing late at night, Junuh 
encounters an unknown stranger 
by the name of Bagger Vance 
(Will Smith). Vance becomes not 
only his caddie, but also his spiri-
tual guide. 

Without any depth to the 

characters, it is uncertain why 
Junuh was traumatized from the 
war. Nor is there understanding 
of how Adele feels and responds 
when Junuh abandons her. [nex-
plicably, there is almost no ani-
mosity between Adele and Junuh, 
even though Junuh abandoned 
her. Instead, there are a lot of nice 
and overly pleasant scenes where 
everyone seems to get along with 
one another. 

Considering Savannah is part 
of the deep South, it's awkward as 
to how Vance, a black man, can 
easily go anywhere he wants at an

all-white golf course. Bagger plays 
quite a minor role, and his words 
of wisdom do not seem to res-
onate nor even motivate. 

The entire film itself is a wild 
stretch of the imagination in 
terms of plausibility as everyone 
seems to rally around Junuh 
without much reason. The golf 
tournament is also an exaggera-
tion, having shots and plays that 
would be rarely, if ever made, let 
alone being macie over and over 
again in a small golf shootout. It 
is this exaggeration that leaves the 
film unsatisfying. 

It is a disappointment consid-
ering the venerable Robert Red-
ford ("The Natural ," "A River 
Runs Through [t") is thl" direc-
tor. Although beautiful cine-
matography and gorgeous golf 
scenes that mark Redford's films 
are visible, the depth of the char-
acters that define Redford's work 
is not apparent. 

Although 'the film tries hard to 
relate its message of golf and that 
perfect swing with life, it tries too 
hard. The result is a film that is 
pleasant, but not fulfilling to the 
soul.

U2 delivers one of their 
best albums ever 
Continued from page 12

A 

Behind Radiohead 's "Kid A," the 
second most anricipated album of 
the year has to be from those four 
Irish lads collectively known as U2. 
Their most recent release, titled 
"All That You Can't Leave Behind," 
is a bea utiful collection of songs 
that blend the classic "Rattle & 
Hum" of U2 and the technology of 
"Pop." 

Since their first release, "BOY," 
U2 have come a long way. Tw~nry­
two years and over 100 million 
albums later, U2 remain one of the 
most enduring bands of our time. 
Even more remarkable is that no 
one has ever left U2 and no new 
member has ever joined. Guitarist 
The Edge, bassist Adam Clayton, 
drummer Larry Mullen and the 
illustrious Bono have stayed 
together to release over 10 albums. 

After successful albums such as 
"October" and "War," U2 
announced in 1984 that th ey 
would be working with producer 
and experimentalist Brian Eno and 
his protege Daniel Lanois for their 
fourth studio album . The result 
was "The Unforgettable Fire," 
which gave the world the charac-
teristic U2 anthems and included 
"Pride (lnThe Name of Love)." 

U2 soon followed with a string 
of unforgettable albums like, "The 
Joshua Tree," "Rallie & Hum," 
"Achtung Baby" and "Zooropa ."

c-ttnued from paC. 13 

mances propelled them into great-
ness. U2's ability to blend humma-
ble melodies, striking lyrics and the 
soaring voice of Bono enabled 
them to push past basic pop music. 

[t was nearly four years after 
"Zooropa" and their ground break-
ing Zoo TV tour that U2 released 
another album. Though "Pop" 
topped the charts, the musIc critics 
questioned whether U2 were push-
ing the envelope a bit too much with 
their e1ectronica-tinged album. 

"All That You Can't Leave 
Behind" seems to bring together all 
of the qualities that made U2'what 
they are today. Thoughtful lyrics, 
cinematic arrangements and the 
unmistakable U2 riffs from The 
Edge are coupled with the smooth 
electronic beats and keyboards. 

U2's first single and the first 
track off of their new album, 
"Beautiful Day" sets the tone for 
the rest of the recording with sleek 
electronic beats and a melody that 
could've been straight from any 
classic U2 album. 

Though U2 seems to be pulling 
old tricks out their hat, one must 
not mistake U2's new album as a 
way to achieve quick commercial 
success. "All That You Can't ... " is 
merely one of the stops in the evo-
lution of U2. 

"Stuck [n a Moment You Can't 
Get Out Of" is a track that could 
tum out to be one of U2's best 
songs. "Stuck In a Moment ..... 
offers a powerful chorus that you 
think is familiar but it is distinctively 
U2. 

Songs like "Kite" and "Wild 
'Honey' blend the slightly ambigu-
ous lyrics of "Pop' yet they still 
retain the heart-tugging beauty of 
their early work. "Peace on Earth .. 
brings back the socially conscious 
lyrics that led U2 to headline 
Amnesty International's Conspira-
cy of Hope Tour in 1986 and play a 
concert in the fragile political set-
ting of Sarajevo.

Crowbar 
Equilibrium 

Spitfire Records 

B+ 
The latest release from long-

standing metal act Crowbar, titled 
"Equilibrium," returns to the New 
Orleans sound they started with. It is 
a sludgy Southern metal that helped 
form the sound of groups like Cor-
rosion of Conformity and Eyehate-
god. Crowbar proves that they still 
have the might and whiskey-driven 
power they brought to the forefront 
of the not-so-underground scene. 

The music is dark and moving, 
staying mostly at the slower tempos 
they love, but occasionally picking 
up the pace for a riff or two. At one 
point they totally change gears and 
delve into a gothic piano and rain 
track that is simple and beautlful. 
Using only clean vocals, Crowbar is 
far from sludge-core, and may not 
please those out for speed and dis-
tortion. Yet for any who enjoy good, 
heavy music, this is a safe bet.

Open Mike at Java Joe's 
DB coffee spot pours out the poetry every Monday 
By UNDIAY lOYD 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

It is another Monday night in 
San Diego. Another week of class-
es or work are ahead, and people 
are already asking, "Is it Friday 
yet?" 

At Java joe's open mic night at 
1956 Bacon Street in Ocean 
Beach. Monday nights are a lively 
mix of song and laughter. Wendy, 
the open mic's emcee, takes the 
stage and leads everyone in a ren-
dition of the open mic theme song. 
The crowd knows the song well -
many of them come to java joe's 
every Monday night. They come in 
baseball caps and business suits, 
and play guitars. saxophones or 
flutes. One man even plays his 
homemade percussion instrument. 
Each night features a wide variety 
of performers, well worth the $3 
cover charge. 

There is a myth about open 
inic nights: that they are a sort of 
breeding ground for raw, unbri-
dled talent. In most cases, this is 
not true. A usual open mic will 
have a handful of girls singing 
about ex-boyfriends and guys 
growling warped renditions of the 
blues. There are always one or two 
gems but for the most part it is 
painfully obvious why some people 

Lost: 
Group fuses hyprwtic 
beats with ethereal chants 
ContIMIed rro. ..... 11 

The group takes a polar 
approach to its music, blend ing 
"a ncient" influences (Sufi , Vedic 
Ind ian, Afro-Mediterranean, 
Gypsy and American Indian) with 

have record deals and other's 
don't. 

At java joe's, there are more 
than just a few gems. Every per-
former is unique, and shockingly, 
they are very good. On Monday 
night (Oct. 9th) the line-up began 
with Matt Carone, who, after hear-
ing a few jokes about his last name, 
claimed it was French for "I don't 
give a shit." Imagine his set as Bob 
Dylan as a Hell's Angel. 

The dim lighting and intimate 
setting embraced all the performers 
who took the stage. Whether they 
made mistakes or stole the show, 
Wendy was never condescending 
or insulting. He complemented 
everyone and the crowd followed 
his lead. 

Later in the evening, it was 
Johnny Love's tum. Johnny must 
have been a thespian in high 
school because his 10-minute set 
combined humor and camp with a 
rich voice and great songs. Unlike 
most open mics, java joe's allows 
dance, comedy and poetry. Any 
oddball talent is good enough for 
their stage, as long as it does not 
exceed the two-songllO-minute 
time limit. 

So will any of the performers at 
open mic nights become the next 
jewel? Maybe. Or, then again, 
probably not. After the last . laue 

modern (Goa trance, rock, funk, 
ambient, folk) musical styles. On 
record, Lost at Last carries a 
patchwork of hypnotic beats, tex-
tured by Lakshmi's ethereal 
chanting and Priyo's synthesized 
strings. 

Their live shows are touted as 
something different altogether. 
with hand and set drums pounding 
away in full ecstatic effect. Heavy 
on the down beats with enough 

has been poured and the coffee fil-
ters h!lv~ been emptied. everyone 

. goes back to their day jobs. If you 
drive two hours north to Los 
Angeles on any given Wednesday 
(most open mics in L.A. are on 
Wednesday nights) you will find an 
entire calendar section of L.A. 
Weekry full of open mics from 
Common Grounds il1 the suburbs 
to Highland Grounds in the city. 
Anytime live music is played in 
Los Angeles, even if it is someone 
playing the xylophone, there is 
always the underlying hope that, 
somewhere out in the audience, 
there might be. an A&R rep, and a 
waitress could become a rock star 
within a week. Is there any truth to 
this illusion? NO. In Ocean Beach, 
it', all about music that may never 
come out of your stereo but will 
still echo in your head. 

[n a time when decent enter-
tainment is expensive and most 
concert lickets are over $4{), java 
joe's is an affordable yet fun way to 
spend a Monday night - especial-
ly since nobody cracks open the 
books until Wednesday anyway. 
The sign-ups begin at 7 p.m. and 
the show starts at 7:30 p.m. For 
more information check out the 
java Joe's Web site:

0356. 

rave-esque climaxes to put a porn 
star to shame, Lost at Last perform 
ritualistically and orchestrate the 
ebb and flow of the audience's 
energy. 

With the supporting cast of fire 
dancers and projection screens 
geared for future flashbacks, the 
concert looks to be an intense 
night filled with techno-primitive 
fervor and festivity. Sun God 
should take notes.

18 SPORTS 

Polo: 
Busch and Onken come 
up with big games 
cont .... ed from ,.,. 20 

Despite Claremont scoring the 
first goal, UCSD was aggressive, 
as it reeled off 13 consecutive 
points after Claremont's initial 
score. 

During the second quarter it 
looked like the Tritons' early 
pressure began to affect Clare-
mont, as UCSD notched three 
goals to its opponents' zero. 
UCSD went into halftime with a 
commanding 5-1 lead, which it 
would not relinquish for the rest 
of the game. 

After being so thoroughly 
dominated in the first half, Clare-
mon t came out for the second 
half looking a little disheartened 
and flummoxed . 

The Tritons, on the other 
hand, came out ready to rumble, 
and that they did. 

Taking advantage of Clare-
mont's demeanor, UCSD tacked 
on four more goals in the th ird 
quarter. Just (or good measure, it 
added another four in the fourth 
quarter to make the final score a 
demoralizing 13-1 - demoraliz-

il~g from Claremont's point of 
view. 

UCSD shared the wealth in 
this con test. Eleven different 
players scored goals. Some of the 
proliferation of scoring might 
have had to do with the Tritons' 
new rotation. 

After every goal, the Tritons 
are throwing a fresh bunch of 
players into the pool. 

"We want to keep the other 
team on their heels and really 
hammer them up and down the 
court." util ity man Matthew Ellis 
said . "We think we can do that 
with this rotation." 

Byron Spicer, Paul Morschall, 

Ken Woodruff and Dave Swine-
hart threw in a goal each. 

Jon Samuels continued his 
explosive standout year with 
three goals. Samuels leads the Tri-
tons with 63 goals for the year, a 
ratio of almost one goal per quar-
ter played. 

Jason Boettner and Hori had 
outstanding contributions to the 
win. Boettner, though he did not 
score a goal, had two assists. Hori 
scored a goal and had three 
assists. 

At goalie, UCSD once again 
saw two different men between 
the bars. This was similar to earli-
er in the season, when it had 
employed a platoon system for 
the position, rotating between 
Glenn Busch and Lance Onken. 
Later the job went to Busch. 

Busch and Onken played 
against Claremont, and each had 
very good games. Busch had five 
saves and one goal against. and 
Onken had four saves and no 
goals against. 

The Tritons must now begin 
to look forward to next Saturday's 
match against UC Irvine. In the 
not-so-distant future comes the 
Western Water Polo Association 
Championships, which fall on 
Nov. 17 to Nov. 19. If UCSD does 
well and wins, the victory will 
assure it of a chance to compete 
at the NCAA Championships in 
Malibu between Dec. 2 and Dec. 
3. . 

With Irvine a top-three 
tea m, this match is a definite 
tattle tape for the Tritqns. With 
a win or a good showing, the 
Tritons can reaffirm their place 
in the top echelon of teams. 
With a bad loss, UCSD will 
have much work to do to pre-
pare for the season-ending 
championships. 

The Irvine game will take 
place Saturday at Canyon view' 
Pool. Start time is noon .

some big, multinational, corporate

one of the conglomerations that

"The Mighty Ducks." 

That is why every SoCal sports 
fan worth his salt is eagerly antici-
pating the upcoming NBA season. 
I, for one, am looking forward to 
seeing Donald Sterling'S Clippers, 
voted last year as the worst fran-
chise in sporting history, come into 
their own, with a fresh crop of 
young players whose starting five 
may possess less collective years 
than our UCSD men's basketball 
squad. 

Of course there is that other 
team that plays in the Staples Cen-
ter, who are not only competent, 
but pretty much tops in the class as 
their league championship last sea-

games the UCSD women's soccer 
team plays on Thursday, starting 
off the postseason. Then on Friday, 
at a time to be announced, UCSD 
will face Sonoma State University 
for a chance to play the No.1 seed, 
CSU Dominguez, in the CCAA 
Championship match. 

UWho doesn't want another 
shot at Dominguez Hills?" asked 
freshman Jeremy Cookson. 
UThey're definitely a great team 
and I'd really like a chance to play 

son can attest. 
This season, the Lakers look to 

be even better with some key new 
personnel, the departures of a 
whiny chump or two, and another 
season of experience in regular and 
postseason play. 

Isaiah Rider is a welcome addi-
tion to the purple and gold, as he 
adds some thug mentality and 
scoring ability. Horace Grant, 
acquired in the three-team deal 
that sent the token white boy Travis 
Knight and olltside shooter Glen 
Rice (and his wife) to the Knicker-
bockers, adds 13 years of experi-
ence and some good 01' fashioned 
whoopass to the Laker team. Mark 
Madsen, the fresh-faced rookie 
who was the Lakers' first round 
draft pick (29th overall) in the latest 
draft will also be given the chance 
to contribute. 

The Lake Show kicked off its 
2000-2001 campaign Tuesday 
night against their fierce old West-
ern rival , the Portland Trailblazers 
and showed that their success will 
be more than short-lived. Shaq-
daddy knocked down 36 points,

them again. But we'll see. From 
here out all that matters is the next 
game. We can't get ahead of our-
selves." 

At the end of it all, Bobby Saa-
dati was the leader in points for the 
Tritons, amassing 22 points with 
nine goals and four assists. Though 
injured, Bernard placed second 
with nine points on two goals and 
five assists. UCSD accumulated an 
overall record of 11-4-2, going 9-3-
2 in league play. 

and the Kobemeister had 14, while 
Rider, the new kid on the block, 
chipped in with 13. 

One important thing, however, 
to keep in mind is that if you were 
not down with-the Lakers before, it 
would be morally and philosophi-
cally wrong to hop onto the old 
bandwagon at this juncture. 

You should be able to remem-
ber the post-ShpwTime, pre-Lake 
Show days when the only real rea-
son to tune into Laker broadcasts 
was to hear the sweet schtick of 
Laker announcer Chick Hearn and 
watch poor Del Harris squirm in 
the harsh big city spotlight. 

Recently, it seems as if everyone 
is a die-hard Laker fan , yet hasn't a 
clue as to who Nick Van Exel is, or, 
in some extreme cases, what the 
Great Western Forum was. 

But take heart all you true fans 
Ollt there. One of these days, per-
haps six to 10 years from now, the 
Lake Show will end, and the team 
will once again sink into medioc-
rity, as all Southern Californian 
teams do. Then it will be all yours 
once again.

S Ollthern California sports have seen better days. The dearth of any sporting fran-
chises that could even be 

labeled as competitive have the 
SoCal sports fans in search of a 
winner, or at least a team that is not 
excruciatingly painful to watch. 

Our baseball teams, the Padres, 
Dodgers and Angels, are all toiling 
away in mediocrity. The Pad squad 
is simply biding their time until 
they can cash in on their new stadi-
um and start making 'some real 
dough . The Dodgers, with their 
preposterously high payroll, paid a 
lot for what they got, which was 
garbage, and the poor Angels will 
always be a second-tier organiza-
tion . 

Our sole football franchise, the 
Chargers, can barely get to the line 
of scrimmage without tripping over 
their own feet or embarrassing 
themselves in some other pathetic 
fashion . 

Of course, while this tomfoolery 
is going on, our two old footba ll 
teams, the defending Superbowl-
champion St. Louis Rams, and the 
Oakland Raiders with their knife-
wielding misfit fans, have compiled 
stellar. records this season. 

Our two hockey teams, well urn, 
eh whatever. Since Gretzky left the 
Kings I've pretty much lost interest. 
There is no way I am supporting

Gearing up 
for Playoffs 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

Division II competition is much 
tougher than Division III competi-
tion. 

Don't tell that to the UCSD 
soccer teams. 

Both squads, stormillg through 
impressive regular seasons, are 
stepping into their first ever Cali-
fornia Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion Championship tournament 
this weekend. 

The women's team captured the 
CCAA Southern Divis ion after 
sporting a 12-2 CCAA record, 14-2 
overall. 

The regular season title earned 
the women a first-place seed in the 
tournament. They face Cal Poly 
Pomona on Thursday at 1 :30 p.m. 
in the first round . If victorious, thl: 
women will head to the CCAA 
finals on Sunday at 11 a.m. 

The men rumbled through the 
regular season, garnering a record 
of 9-3-2 in the CCAA and 11 -4-2 
overall. Now they must face Sono-
ma State in the first round of the 
playoffs on Friday. If they pass that 
test, Cal State Dominguez Hills lies 
ahead on Sunday at 1:30 p.m. 

Cal State Dominguez Hills is

PORTS 
Regular Season Ends On a Low 
Men's soccer falls to USlU 3-0 in unimportant final game before the playoffs 
By ARVIND YUAN 
Staff Writer 

After every loss, the UCSD 
men's soccer team seems to 
rebound with no problem at all. 

After losing to California State 
University Dominguez Hills and 
Sonoma State University, the No. 
1 and No. 2 seeds respectively in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, in back to back 
matches, UCSD went on an eight-
game streak without a loss, com-
piling a record of 6-0-2 . 

The great streak came to a halt, 
however, when they traveled to Cal 
Poly Pomona to face a talented 
Buffalo team. Their loss in 
Pomona displayed their injury 
woes, as Brady Bernard and Ryan 
Mizumoto were among those 
missing. 

Before the final stretch toward 
the playoffs, the Ua:lD men's soc-
cer team partook in an alumni 
match on Ott. 28 featuring UCSD 
soccer players from years past. 

The older team received a sur-
prise: one of the previous UCSD 
players, Robert Cramplit, flew all 
the way from Japan with his wife 
to play in this game. The game was 
a great one, ending in a 4-4 tie. 

"[t was a w.onderful event to 
partake in," said head coach Derek 
Armstrong. "Seeing previous play-
ers from older days mixing with 
the new talent we have was nice." 

After the Alumni match came 
United States International Uni-
versity on Oct. 3D, the last match 
for the Tritons before they play 
rival Sonoma State University on 
Friday. This game was no easy 
task. US[U is a Division I school 
that has won 14 games this year, 
beating teams with great winning 

Leo Oer Stepanians/Guardian 
HuMIn': The Tritons Bobby Saadati, woo has scored 24 total points this season, hopes to lead his team during their playoff push 
records. 

The game was a struggle from 
start to finish . USIU was hot, and 
its strength and quickness hurt 
the wounded Tritons. The game 
ended in a 3-0 victory for USIU, as 
its dominance cou ld be accredited 
to their Division [ stature. 

"They were very good, being 
more physical and pounding the 
ball around the field ," Armstrong 

said. "With Brady [Bernard] and 
both Ryans [Blair and Mizumoto] 
out, we couldn't handle them." 

It is obvious to see that the 
UCSD men's soccer team is ailing, 
struggling to find offense and a 
consistent rhythm. 

"We must regroup our team for 
the championship run," Arm-
strong said. "We will have Brady 
Bernard and Ryan Blair back, so 

we should have all the elements to 
win." 

While commenting on the 
Somona State match, Armstrong 
said he expects a "good match 
from both sides and a tight match 
throughout." 

"We don't know if they know 
about our injuries or not, and I

Claremont Spanked by the Tritons 13-1 
Men's water polo gets reacquainted with victories in a big way after thrashing an old foe 
By TAIT MILLER 
Associate Sports Editor 

UCSD water polo jumped 
back in the saddle in a big way 
on Sunday when it shellacked 
visiting Claremont College, 13-
1. 

After a dry spell in the win 
column, which included a dis-
appointing, bs:fuddled showing 
at 'the NorCal Tournament in 
Stockton, the Tritons were 
primed and ready to resume 
their winning ways. 

The first quarter saw UCSD 
attack relentlessly with pressure 
on both sides of the ba ll, con-
founding and confusing Clare-
mont goalies in a 2-1 deficit 
when the quarter ended. 

"We were looking to reverse 
a trend," said Kellan Hori, driver 
for the Tritons. "In the last six or 
seven games we have been slow 
out of the blocks, and we want-
ed to change that in this game:
