As UCSD’s new Web site continues 
its metamorphosis, users will witness 
developments in coming months that 
include a feature allowing students 
to change their major online, more 
department-specific pages and general 
alterations that hope to accommodate 
the results of usability surveys. 

Web sites linked to the campus’ 
main site will eventually boast fea-
tures and graphics similar to the main 
TritonLink page. 

“We’re actively developing a mini-
Web site that will provide campus enti-
ties with everything they need to adopt 
the new UC San Diego web brand,”

Undergrad TA Contract: Teaching the Wrong Lesson?

By Matthew McArdle
Senior Staff Writer

For the past two years, Revelle 
College senior Jonathan Kommemi has 
diligently served as an undergraduate 
teaching assistant for the mathematics 
department, working alongside gradu-
ate students, leading discussions, hold-
ing office hours and grading exams.

So after the University of California 
and the United Auto Workers — the 
union representing TAs systemwide 
— agreed to contract provisions outlin-
ing quarterly fee remissions for under-
graduate TAs last October, Kommemi 
eagerly approached his boss with a sim-
ple question: When would he be eligible 
to receive his fee abatement?

Kommemi was told that the con-
tract did not apply to him because he 
did not, in fact, serve as a TA. Rather, he 
was hired as a tutor, so he would not be 
offered a remission of educational and 
registration fees, which amount to more 
than $2,200 per quarter this year. 

Kommemi’s case is not unique.
According to UCSD Labor Relations 
Director Lori J. Trofemuk, the contract 
does not apply to undergraduate TAs at 
UCSD because of a simple discrepancy 
regarding job codes drawn by the UC 
Office of the President under which 
TAs on this campus are hired.

Rather than hiring undergraduate 
TAs under codes 2311 or 2310 — titles 
that are contractually mandated to 

receive remission — UCSD employs 
them under a tutor code, 2860, which is 
not granted a fee exemption.

“It’s tradition at UCSD to hire 
undergraduate teaching assistants 
under [2860],” Trofemuk said. “I don’t 
know why.”

The contract, hailed by UAW as 
“nationally precedent-setting” for 
undergraduate TAs, came after months 
of negotiations. But currently, accord-
ing to UCSD spokeswoman Dolores 
Davies, only UC Davis and UC Berkeley 
employ undergraduate TAs under the 
codes specified for remission.

Both Davies and Trofemuk said 
that UCSD never hires undergraduates  

through codes 2311 or 2310, but Scott 
Rollans, the undergraduate program 
officer for the mathematics department, 
said that as recently as Fall Quarter 2007 
he noticed several undergraduates had 
been grouped under 2310, mostly by 
the biology department. 

“I was surprised that there appeared 
to be some hired under that category,” 
he said.

Mark Whelan, a student affairs offi-
cer in the biology department in charge 
of hiring teaching assistants, refused 
to comment, and instead referred all 
inquiries to Trofemuk.

Kommemi said he is outraged that 
UCSD has refused to offer fee relief for 

Following UC, union  
contract ratification, 
UCSD undergraduate TAs 
remain excluded from key 
fee-remission provision.

Orange County’s toll road agency 
announced last week that it was asking 
the U.S. Department of Commerce 
to reconsider a Feb. 6 decision by the 
California Coastal Commission that 
decisively halted construction plans 
for a toll road through San Onofre 
State Park. 

Heading north, the proposed 
toll road would begin south of San 
Clemente, about 40 miles north of La 
Jolla, and run 16 miles to cut across the 
San Diego/Orange County line.

The commission made its final 8-
2 decision at the end of a 12-hour 
meeting attended by nearly 3,500 
Southern Californians at the Del Mar 
fairgrounds. San Diegans have paid 
particular attention to the roadway 
because San Onofre is a common vaca-
tion destination and the nation’s fifth 
most visited state park.

Many panelists sided with 
Chairman Pat Kruer of Rancho Santa 
Fe in finding the toll road inconsistent 
with California state laws regulating 
development along the coastline.

UCSD’s A.S. Council passed a reso-
lution last year voicing opposition to 
the project, which was submitted by 
then-Eleanor Roosevelt College Junior 
Senator Kerry Kassam.

“I think it’s important to preserve 
what’s left of our natural beauty in 
San Diego,” Kassam said. “San Onofre, 
especially Trestles Beach, is one of the 
most gorgeous places that students can 
visit to camp, swim, surf and indulge in 
a little bit of calm.”

John Muir College senior Kenna 
Crouch attended the meeting in Del 
Mar, and said she agreed with Kassam’s 
concerns. 

“I think that Southern California 
is already an urban jungle,” Crouch 
said. “There are so many people 
with a special connection to [the 
park]. It would be morally wrong to 
destroy it so that people can drive 
faster.”

The state park holds several 
endangered species and an untaint-
ed stretch of San Mateo Creek. In 
addition, it houses the San Mateo 
Campground and several archaeo-
logical sites, including the Juaneño 
American Indian village of Panhe.

Opponents of the $875-million, six-
lane project say it would destroy natu-
ral habitats, wetlands and public rec-
reation areas, including the renowned 
surfing spot at Trestles. Surfers claim 
the road would block the sediment 
deposits that create the waves there.

all qualified undergraduate TAs simply 
because of “tradition,” and that he feels 
his work should be recognized as equal 
to that of graduate students’, who receive 
fee remission and are paid about four 
times as much for doing the same type 
of work he does.

Currently, Kommemi teaches two 
MATH 10C sections, and three gradu-
ate students split the remaining eight 
sections. In the past, Kommemi has 
led four sections to a graduate student 
TA’s two.

“To call their behavior shady would 
be an understatement,” Kommemi said.

Undergraduate teaching assistants such as Jonathan Kommemi remain excluded from contractually bound fee remissions because UCSD labels them tutors.

In the wake of the state’s $14.5-
billion deficit, a state assembly-
man recently proposed legislation 
that would provide members of the 
California National Guard with free 
tuition at state colleges and universi-
ties while simultaneously repealing 
legislation that would allow some 
illegal immigrants to qualify for in-
state tuition.

Assemblyman Chuck DeVore (R-
Irvine) estimated that the cost of cov-
ering tuitions for all persons serving 
in the California National Guard to 
be about $3 million. 

“We are the only state in the 
nation that doesn’t cover our national 
guardsmen,” said Robert Flanigan, a 
senior consultant for DeVore. “These 
men and women are called upon 

New legislation could 
provide free college 
tuition for National 
Guardsmen, cut earmarks 
for illegal immigrants. 

more than any guard in the nation — 
they fight fires, floods, earthquakes 
and wars abroad. It’s due time that we 
properly compensate them for their 
service.”

DeVore’s bill, titled AB 1758, seeks 
to repeal AB 540, legislation passed in 
2001 that granted illegal immigrants 
eligibility for in-state tuition if they 
graduated from a California high 
school and agreed to legalize their 
resident status if given the oppor-
tunity. 

The Legislative Analyst’s Office 
estimated the cost of in-state resi-
dency waivers, granted primarily to 
illegal immigrants, to be $117 million 
in 2005-06. 

Flanigan said that the annual 
$3-million cost of covering national 
guardsmen is a wiser allocation of 
resources, compared to the $117 mil-
lion spent on in-state residency waiv-
ers for illegal immigrants, especially 
when considering the state’s budget 
deficit. 

“When we are in a budget deficit 
and we are cutting vital services like 
Medicare among other things, why 
aren’t we cutting this?” Flanigan said. 
“This should be the first to go, and as 
far as investing in our state’s future,

who is to say these people are going 
to stay here?”

Flanigan explained that tying the 
National Guardsmen issue to the costs 
of funding education for illegal immi-
grants would put economic issues into 
better perspective for taxpayers and the 
Democrat-controlled state Legislature.

“The state chooses to reward peo-
ple who are here illegally with $117 
million, yet is unable to cover guard 
members when it only costs $3 mil-
lion a year,” he said. “Taxpayers need 
to ask themselves, ‘Is this a wise allo-

Preuss School Team Wins 
Regional Science Bowl

A team of five Preuss School 
students won the U.S. Department 
of Energy’s National Science Bowl 
for high school students in the San 
Diego regional championship last 
week, beating 11 other teams from 
San Diego County high schools.

In May, the team will compete 
against 66 others in the National 
Science Bowl finals. Sponsored by 
the National Organization for the 
Professional Advancement of Black 
Chemists & Chemical Engineers, the 
competition tests students’ knowl-
edge of biology, chemistry, earth sci-
ence, physics and math in a fast-
paced, game-show-style format.

UC Receives Top Number 
of Sloan Fellowships

Seventeen UC researchers 
received Alfred P. Sloan Research 
Fellowships last week, marking a 
higher number of awards than at any 
other university. At UCSD, neurosci-
ence researcher Adam R. Aron and 
physics researcher Congjun Wu were 
awarded the grants.

Overall, the Sloan Foundation’s 
$5.9 million in fellowships went to 
faculty members at 64 colleges and 
universities in the U.S. and Canada. 
Recipients were honored for their 
research in physics, chemistry, 
molecular biology, computer sci-
ence, economics, mathematics and 
neuroscience. Fellows may use their 
two-year $50,000 awards for the 
lines of inquiry of their choice. Since 
1995, Sloan Research Fellowships 

have supported the work of out-
standing young researchers early in 
their academic careers. Thirty-five 
recipients have gone on to claim 
the Nobel Prize in their fields and 14 
have received the Fields Medal, the 
top honor in mathematics.

New Web Site Offers 
Professor, Course Ratings

A new Web site launched 
Saturday gives California college 
students the opportunity to view 
grade distributions and professor 
evaluations before they enroll in 
courses.

The Web site, Campus Buddy 
(www.thecampusbuddy.com), features 
graphs of grade percentages as well 
as statistics regarding how many 
courses were included in the analy-
sis. All professors in each department 
are listed, and Web site members are 
able to rate professors and provide a 
written explanation of their rating.

Similar services already exist, 
such as the professor ratings from 
C.A.P.E. evaluations on UCSD’s 
TritonLink Web site, but in a recent 
interview with the Daily Bruin at 
UCLA, Campus Buddy co-designer 
Mike Moradi said the new platform 
enables students to see the most 
objective analysis of professors 
before choosing.

He said the Web site includes 
over eight million grades from 32 
campuses, and that all data came 
directly from school officials. He 
added that since grades greatly influ-
ence job prospects, Campus Buddy 
will ultimately benefit students.

“As students, you don’t get 
paid,” Moradi said. “Your salary’s 
your grade.”

“Not only do I feel cheated out of the 
spirit of the contract, but every UCSD 
undergraduate TA should as well.”

According to UCSD’s policies that 
govern the hiring of academic student 
employees, TAs are responsible for 
“conducting discussion or laboratory 
sections that supplement faculty lec-
tures and by grading assignments” in 
addition to holding office hours and 
proctoring exams. Tutors, however, are 
charged with providing assistance to 
individual or small groups of under-
graduate students who require extra 
help to understand course materials.

Kommemi said he clearly performs 
the duties of a TA rather than a tutor.

“I can provide the same quality edu-
cation as any graduate student, and if 
the department truly doesn’t believe so, 
maybe the department shouldn’t be in 
the business of hiring undergraduate 
TAs,” he said.

Trofemuk refused to comment on 
why UCSD could not simply switch 
the codes through which it currently 
employs undergraduate TAs, instead 
saying that UAW representatives should 
have addressed the issue before the con-
tract was ratified.

“They never came back and request-
ed any other language,” she said. “We 
knew that this would not have any effect 
at UCSD.”

UAW Vice President Christine Petit, 
a graduate student at UC Riverside, said 
the union would keep fighting to force 
the UC system to standardize its under-
graduate TA coding practices.

“They need to recognize our work as 
equal and not make differentials about 
the work that we do based on specific 
campuses,” Petit said.

Fee-Focused Meeting Touts 
Tuition Freezes, Grove’s Growth

A former gubernatorial candi-date dropped in at last night’s brief A.S. Council meeting to 
provide his own two cents about finan-
cial difficulties facing students.

Earl Warren College alumnus 
Daniel Watts took the floor during 
public input to speak about the Grove 
Caffe’s monetary woes. Watts suggested 
that the council dig into its mandated 
reserves — an “emergency fund” for 
A.S. enterprises-in-need that he said 
was holding a tidy $800,000 — to buy 
out the eatery’s $66,000 debt.

There wasn’t a 
discernible con-
sensus among 
councilmembers 
about the sugges-
tion, although the 
thought of spend-
ing $66,000 on a 
coffee shop may 
have shocked any uninitiated Starbucks 
customers in attendance.

Associate Vice President of 
Enterprise Operations Chelsea 
Maxwell elaborated on the cafe’s 
financial health, saying that necessary 
improvements and equipment pur-
chases were to blame for the growth of 
its original $24,000 debt at the begin-
ning of the school year.

Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Sarah Chang also chimed 
in, saying that the Grove is now either 
breaking even or turning a profit on 
a monthly basis, and implied that the 
cafe would be able to work off its own 
debt. Buyer beware: That $66,000 may 
be coming to a croissant near you.

Watts, who graduated in 2006, also 
took the opportunity to tout his unsuc-
cessful campaign for California gov-
ernor during the 2003 recall election. 
His gubernatorial ambitions focused 
solely on the issue of rising college 
tuition costs, which has come into the 
mainstream news once again in light of 

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s recently 
proposed state budget cuts.

Watts endorsed the efforts of the 
student group Tuition Relief Now 
to put an initiative on the ballot in 
November that would cap tuition  from 
rising faster than inflation. 

Vice President of External Affairs 
Dorothy Young kept the cause of ris-
ing tuition afloat by introducing the 
council to the “budget postcard cam-
paign,” which aims to bombard state 
legislators with signed postcards from 
concerned students. During ques-

tion time, Earl 
Warren College 
Senator Peter 
Benesch asked 
Vice President of 
Student Life Donna 
Bean about how 
the planning pro-
cess for next quar-

ter’s Sun God festival was progressing. 
Benesch raised the question in light of 
a controversial report regarding the 
handling of the annual event.

Bean was pleased to report that 
the Sun God advisory committee 
had surprisingly reached a consensus 
between its administrators and student 
representatives. She also reported that 
the logistics for the event had been 
reworked but teased the council by 
saying that she couldn’t release any 
more information, including the head-
liner act, for a few more weeks.

Near the end of the meeting, 
Associate Vice President of Athletic 
Relations Stephanie Chang reminded 
councilmembers about their upcom-
ing participation in the Row for the 
Cure fundraising and boat racing event 
this weekend and caught some of the 
students off guard by asking them to 
sign some last-minute paperwork.

“You just need to sign a form that 
says if you drown it’s not our fault,” 
she said.

said the ruling was a huge win for 
surfers.

“Basically the best spot for pro-
fessional surfing in California was 
going to be ruined to a certain extent,” 
Brajkovich said.

It was estimated that 320 of the 
park’s 2,100 acres would have been 
taken by the project, according 
to the California State Park and 
Recreation Commission.

Transportation Corridor Agencies, 
the company that operates Orange 
County’s toll road system, argued that 
the toll road is necessary to maintain 
the economy, environment and quality 
of life in Southern California, estimat-
ing a 60-percent increase in traffic at 
the Orange/San Diego County border 
by 2025. 

“We are very disappointed that 
the Coastal Commission failed to 
recognize the years of study that have 
gone into this roadway’s planning 
and design to protect the environ-
ment and valuable state park and 
coastal resources,” Lance MacLean, 
chairman of the Foothill/Eastern 
Transportation Agency, said in a 
statement.

TCA also cited independent sci-
entific studies as evidence that the 
roadway will have “negligible impact” 
on San Onofre State Park and Trestles 
Beach.

More than 40 elected officials from 
Southern California, the majority 
of whom represent cities in Orange 
County, spoke at the meeting to sup-
port the roadway.

They said the project is environ-
mentally friendly because it would 
reduce pollution from cars sitting in 
traffic. They also claimed that a coun-
terproposal by environmentalists to 

expand Interstate 5 would result in the 
elimination of hundreds of homes and 
businesses next to the freeway while 
unsuccessfully confronting problem-
atic traffic delays.

About a dozen elected officials 
from San Diego County attended 
the Del Mar meeting. Those from 
Carlsbad and Oceanside supported 
the construction, while those from 
coastal cities farther south protested 
it. 

Crouch said the atmosphere of the 
public forum at the Del Mar meeting 
was encouraging.

“Generally everyone was being 
respectful,” she said. “People were say-
ing that they want to save Trestles for 
their grandkids.” 

Several hundred union workers 
wearing bright orange shirts showed 
up to support the project, shouting 
“We need the work.” 

The road’s opponents, wearing 
blue T-shirts that read, “Save the 
Park, Stop the Toll Road,” booed the 
proponents.

Hundreds of people wishing to 
speak submitted requests to be heard 
at the meeting. 

However, Kruer closed public 
comment at 8:30 p.m., saying that if 
everyone were allowed to speak, the 
meeting could have lasted up to 38 
hours.

Construction on the project can-
not commence without the approval 
of a coastal development permit, but 
the secretary of the Department of 
Commerce has the right to over-
ride the Coastal Commission, a deci-
sion not expected for approximately 
a year.

cation of our resources? Is this how I 
want my money to be spent?’”

Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Grecia Lima, a member of the Migrant 
Rights Awareness group at UCSD, 
expressed her concerns regarding 
DeVore’s proposed legislation. 

“The repealing of AB 540 is not the 
worst part of this law,” she said. “It’s the 
crafting, execution, attention and mes-
sage that it sends to the general public.”

Lima said that passing the bill 
would send the 
wrong message to 
California and the 
rest of the nation 
regarding the state’s 
stance on illegal 
immigration.

“It questions the 
fundamental right 
to education for a 
community that is 
already disenfran-
chised, it adds divi-
sion to the already 
divided American 
public and it reinforces the dualism of 
‘us’ vs. ‘them,’” Lima said.

Lima said that illegal immigrants 
pay sales tax and oftentimes contribute 
to Social Security funds, benefits that 
they may never be able to reclaim. In 
fact, recent years have seen an increase 
in Individual Taxpayer Identification 
Numbers — issued to individuals 
obliged to pay taxes but who can-
not obtain a Social Security number 
— many of which belong to illegal 

immigrants. 
“The truth is that by separating the 

‘illegal immigrants’ from the ‘taxpayers’ 
of our society, we create a dualism and 
division that is easy for people to buy 
into; the illegal versus the legal, the 
good versus the bad,” Lima said. “I am 
tired of having to explain that the ‘ille-
gal immigrant’ community is human 
beings. Not until our society is able to 
embrace that idea will we be able to 
have open dialogue about the downfalls 
and solutions of immigration.”

Lima said that 
AB 540 primar-
ily impacted the 
community col-
lege system, and 
even with the 
benefits provided 
by the bill, high-
tier universities 
like UCSD are not 
within the reach 
of many first-gen-
eration college 
students. 

“I am sure that 
the Assemblyman Chuck DeVore has 
not realized the very low fiscal impact 
that these students actually have since 
waivers of in-state tuition are not only 
provided for illegal immigrants but also 
for other students,” she said. 

AB 1758 is scheduled to be heard 
March 4 in the Assembly Higher 
Education Committee.

EDITORIALS

It looks like the University of California just can’t get its act together, and the Western 
Association of Schools and Colleges 
recently added its name to the long 
list of UC critics in a report that 
carped at bungling university higher 
ups. 

After years of pay scandals, gov-
erning fumbles and zero executive 
transparency, it’s no surprise that one 
of the main accreditors of California 
schools finally said something.  

By now, WASC’s take on the UC 
may be one spook story too many 
(how does infrastructure really 
effect the common student?), but the 
scandal’s magnitude has undeniably 
and irrevocably altered the college 
system’s reputation and repute.

Though the system’s status 
clearly isn’t threatened — no matter 
how out of hand the UC Board of 
Regents gets there’s no way some of 
the nation’s top public universities 
are going to lose their accreditation 
— this is a critic the regents should 

finally start taking seriously. 
When are students finally going 

to see their administrators held 
accountable for rampant incompe-
tence?

The sorest travesty is the extent 
to which our schools’ top adminis-
trators admit their own confusion. 
Simple job descriptions are being 
formed at the regents’ level, and 
the UC Office of the President is 
an entangled ball of yarn.  The UC-
commissioned working group that 
is outlining regents’ responsibilities 
glossed over the inherent troubles, 
choosing instead to formulate a 
broadly weak six-part plan. 

The workgroup is even catch-
ing flak from its own subjects, with 
regents claiming that the plan ignored 
addressing the bureaucratic overlaps 
that pain regents to this day. 

The university’s head doesn’t 
know what its hands are doing, at 
a time when it is set to swap out 
its leadership — the combination 
will prove to be make or break. The 

departure of UC President Robert C. 
Dynes will either allow the university 
to completely reshape its infrastruc-
ture or plunge the prestigious system 
into disarray.  Even if the regents 
have no idea what they’re doing now, 
they need to shape up quick: Within 
a year they will have to tap a suc-

cessor that is both cognizant of the 
university’s problems and capable of 
handling them.

Hopefully Dynes’ departure will 
mean a reality check for the messy 
university administration, marking 
a significant bureaucratic overhaul 
— and fast.

Flops to Assemblyman Chuck DeVore for 
proposing a bill that arbitrarily prohibits 

grant eligibility for illegal immigrants while 
waiving tuiton for National Guardsmen.

Before you read any further, keep in mind that I did, in fact, vote for Sen. Barack 
Obama (D-Ill.) in the primary elec-
tions. 

Early in the election season I 
was a very skeptical Obama sup-
porter, mostly because voting for 
him represented supporting a 
Democratic Party that I have lost 
faith in. However, as the prima-
ries crept closer and closer I found 
myself gravitating more and more to 
the man who passionately spoke of 
change and hope. I was impressed by 
how Obama could motivate crowds 
of people, getting them to chant his 
name one minute and laugh their 
heads off the next. I decided to 
throw my original cautions to the 
wind, and on Feb. 5 I contentedly 
filled in the little ballot circle beside 
Obama’s name. 

Since Super Tuesday, the junior 
senator from Illinois has overcome 
the delegate gap between himself 
and Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.), 
making an Obama win seem within 
reach. With the election victories 
piling up in his favor, I have started 
to pay more attention to exactly 
what he so eloquently says on stage 
after each subsequent primary win. 
Hearing him speak makes me feel 
happy and secure, but after watching 
enough of these speeches over the 
last two weeks I have come to realize 
that he says the same things every 
time, and that in the end he hasn’t 
really said anything at all. 

He boasts of bringing change and 
giving Americans hope to make the 
country better from the bottom up, 
but never did I once hear him spe-
cifically outline how, as president, he 
would work to eradicate our nation’s 
abundant problems. It is easy enough 
to point out what is wrong with the 
United States, but to present a plan 
for bringing about change is what 
actually matters. 

After my idealistic Obama bubble 
burst I took it upon myself to find 
out his stance on many important 
issues. This search made me realize 
that while his projected persona and 
ability to motivate Americans sets 
him apart from other candidates, 
some of his beliefs and plans directly 
counter his speeches’ flowery rheto-
ric. 

He lambasts President George W. 
Bush and the war in Iraq, yet he 
has openly supported continuing the 
War on Terror with a willingness 
to attack Iran and Pakistan. He has 
called for the slow phasing out of 
certain troops from the Middle East, 
yet has simultaneously proposed the 
deployment of an additional 65,000 
Army troops and 27,000 Marines. 
Even the mainstream, conservative-
leaning voices at ABC News have 
said that Obama has “a geopoliti-
cal posture that is more aggressive 
than that of President Bush.” Obama 
claims to stand for change, but how 
is threatening Iran and Pakistan with 
nuclear carnage a change from the 
past eight years of Bush’s foreign 
policy?

When the University of California and the United Auto Workers — the 
union representing TAs across the 
10-campus system — agreed to a 
new contract last October, one of 
the document’s most groundbreaking 
provisions centered on the issue of fee 
remissions for undergraduate TAs.

Under the agreement, quali-
fied undergraduate TAs systemwide 
employed under certain codes devel-
oped and regulated by the UC Office 
of the President would be eligible for 
quarterly abatements of educational 
and registration fees. For the average 
TA, the remission would equate to 
roughly $2,200, a hefty sum for most 
college students.

Naturally, the union hailed the 
contract as nationally precedent-set-
ting. And just as naturally, the univer-
sity has dodged the contact’s intent, 
leaving undergraduate TAs at UCSD 
without remissions and wondering 
why the contract was even enacted in 
the first place.

The codes outlined in the agree-
ment — 2310 and 2311 — are not 
even used at UCSD, according to 
Labor Relations Director Lori J. 
Trofemuk. Instead, nothing more 
than campus “tradition” has dictated 
that TAs be hired under a different 
code: 2860, a label reserved specifi-
cally for tutors.

There’s just one problem: If the 

codes in the agreement are read-
ily in place at every campus, nothing 
more than a technicality is preventing 
extremely qualified UCSD TAs from 
receiving remissions they rightfully 
deserve. TAs at UC Berkeley and UC 
Davis are already benefiting from 
the contract’s provisions, so what’s 
stopping UCSD from catching up? 
Clearly, the answer is greed. Though 
Trofemuk would be the last person to 
admit that.

Her answer about why UCSD 
employs its hardworking undergrad-
uate TAs under a code inappropriate 
for them was, get this: “I don’t know.” 
And that’s verbatim. It’s a shame cam-
pus officials have become so accus-
tomed to sucking money away from 
students that they don’t even realize 
they’re doing it anymore.

It’s obvious that TAs are vast-
ly different from tutors — even 
UCSD understands this simple fact. 
According to campus policies govern-
ing the hiring of academic employees, 
TAs are responsible for grading and 
proctoring assignments and exams, 
hosting office hours and conduct-
ing discussions or laboratory sections 
to supplement faculty instruction. 
Tutors, however, are responsible for 
providing assistance to small groups 
of undergraduates who need extra 
help understanding course materials. 

Undergraduate TAs work along-
side graduate students, who already 

receive fee abatements and make 
about four times as much as their 
undergraduate counterparts. And in 
some instances, lesser-compensated 
undergraduate TAs have even taught 
more sections than graduate students, 
a clear instance of inequality at the 
workplace.

It’s time for UCSD to stand up 
and do the right thing by honoring 
the contract’s provisions. There’s no 
reason why UCSD TAs should miss 
out on contractually mandated ben-
efits granted to TAs at other UC cam-
puses who perform the same duties. 
Tradition is not a strong enough rea-
son for our campus’ TAs  to remain 
marginalized.

STUDENT CENTERS AND 
HEALTH — Feeling distressed, 
students? If so, then you can call 
Psychological and Counseling Services 
to make an appointment — and wait a 
few weeks to get professional help 
— or, according to the mental health 
plan proposed by Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue, students 
can call an academic adviser, then wait 
a few weeks to get un-professional help 
before calling to make an appointment 
at P&CS. If the latter option doesn’t 

seem fit, a student can hope that a 
UCSD faculty member will notice the 
student in distress and confront him 
or her about it, 
then make an 
appointment for 
the student to see 
a psychologist.    

Clearly, the 
best solution for 
the stressed-out 
student here is 
to just make an 
appointment at 
P&CS. But, even 
this option has its 
flaws; the student 
would have to 
wait a few weeks 
before being able 
to speak with a professional — a time 
that may be crucial to the student’s 
mental health. 

In order to close this incubation-

al gap that forces students to wait, 
All-Campus Senator Meaghan Clair 
proposed to Rue that a walk-in psy-

chologist for the 
campus be hired. 
Though the vice 
chancellor consid-
ered this option, 
she brought up a 
legitimate con-
cern: Would the 
p s yc h o l o g i s t ’s 
value be maxi-
mized? 

Worthy con-
cern, but it seems 
that having an 
on-hand psychol-
ogist may serve 
best for students’ 

mental health for many reasons.
It’s true that a lack of students 

seeking regular help from the walk-in 
psychologist would create efficiency 

problems for the already tight-bud-
geted P&CS. 

The school would be paying top 
dollar for a psychologist that wouldn’t 
necessarily be doing much work. But 
with weeklong waits for such impor-
tant care, a walk-in service is clearly 
a worthy investment. What is more 
important than mental health? 

Certainly not cushioning already-
massive administrative salaries, though 
university officials are happy to pump 
tons of funding in that direction.

According to a survey conduct-
ed by the American College Health 
Association in 2006, approximately 
92 percent of university students felt 
overwhelmed at one time or another. 
Out of the 92 percent, 44 percent, 
or about half the students, indicated 
they had once felt extremely depressed 
— enough for them to have trouble 

Delay for On-Campus Psychological Help Too Long to Ignore

“The student would have to wait a few weeks before being able to speak with a 
professional — a time 
that may be crucial.”

New initiatives to 
improve assistance for 
overwhelmed students 
are encouraging, but 
there’s more to be done.

Shady UCSD ‘Tradition’ Shafts Hardworking TAs

RSO Report a Good Idea, 
Deserves a Chance

Dear Editor,
The article “RSOs Designed to 

Regulate, Not Congregate, With 
Students” printed in the Feb. 11 
edition of the Guardian was utterly 
misguided. The writer, Jake Blanc, 
criticized the proposal for increased 
interaction between residential 
security officers and students in an 
attempt to curb the chronic binge 
drinking that no doubt occurs on 
campus. 

In fact, he suggested that “it 
would be a complete waste to 
spend time and money on further 
reports in an effort to bridge the 
gap between students and RSOs” 
and that “[former Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joseph W.] 
Watson’s original hypothesis that 
greater amity between the student 
body and campus security would 
cut down on illegal drinking [was] 
ridiculous.”

In fact, it has been shown both 
in Great Britain and Australia 
that increased positive interaction 
between police and youth has not 
only dramatically decreased youth 
violence and binge drinking, but it 
has also slowed the spread of sexu-
ally transmitted infections through 
education programs regarding safe 
drug use and safe sex. 

I find it thoroughly dishearten-
ing to read another article panning 
these kinds of programs. 

Binge drinking is a major cause 
of death for Americans between 
the ages of 15 and 24, contributing 
to over 45 percent of all deaths (L. 
Blumenthal, M.D., MUSC Student 
Health Services). 

As an Australian exchange stu-
dent, I am well aware of the prob-
lems of youth binge drinking since 
it is a similarly major health issue in 
Australia. Blanc would be better off 
doing more research into successful 
mitigation of binge drinking.

ON CAMPUS — Nestled in a quaint 
corner of UCSD Medical School is 
a little-known culinary haven called 
Club Med. Located between the 
Biomedical Library and the Cedar 
Clinical Research building, this cafe 
and dining hall represents all that is 
good and pure in the gastronomic 
world. Open only on weekdays dur-
ing the morning and afternoon, Club 
Med offers a wide array of food that 
is tastier, healthier and cheaper than 
anything else found on campus. If 
that weren’t enough to attract UCSD 
students, the fact that Club Med 
accepts dining dollars is. 

It seems as though Club Med is 
the paragon of campus eateries, yet 
for as much as it contributes to the 
school, the university powers that 
be have decided its services are no 
longer required and thus it will be 
destroyed.

According to the Dining Services 
Coordinator Ralph Dauphin, the 
school has decided that the space 
that Club Med occupies could be 
better used for the construction of 
another medical building or research 
institute. UCSD has informed the 
dining facility that it will be shut 
down sometime before the end of the 
2008 academic year. The building will 
be leveled in preparation for the new 
medical blueprints. 

The fact that the majority of 
UCSD students immediately connect 
the name Club Med to a rich tropi-
cal resort is indicative of the lack of 
attention that the cafe has been given 
over its decade of existence. Club 
Med has produced a very loyal, albeit 
small, group of followers who show 
up every day at lunchtime to enjoy 
one of its exquisite salads, sandwich-
es, burritos or burgers. Although the 
Club Med faithfuls frequent the estab-
lishment with passionate consistency, 

university officials have decided that 
the cafe does not produce enough 
revenue to warrant its survival. 

Club Med is a simple one-story 
building that consists of a handful of 
outdoor tables surrounding a space 
no larger than Canyonview Pool. 
Considering that towering science 
buildings surrounding it dwarf Club 
Med, UCSD has decided that a build-
ing so small and insignificant should 
be bulldozed to make room for new 
science buildings. Never mind that 
Club Med offers phenomenal street 
tacos for $1.25 or a salad bar that rou-
tinely boasts fresh mango, jicama and 
bell peppers — all that UCSD sees is 
a new high-rise pumping out award-
winning scientific breakthroughs. 

It would be one thing if no land 
were available on the Medical School 
campus, forcing the university to 
choose between maintaining the 
small cafe and its proposed science 
building, but spread out directly in 
front of the zone in question is a 
huge, open entrance lawn. It would 
seem simple enough, if the school 
truly wanted to displace Club Med 
in favor of a new medical building, 
to simply relocate the dining facility 
to another open area or move it into 
an already vacant spot on campus. 
UCSD has considered none of these 
alternatives, choosing to ignore the 
significance that Club Med has for 
the school as a whole.

Club Med is one of the few dining 

halls with a specific theme: healthy 
eating. All of its dishes are made fresh 
daily and consist of healthy ingredi-
ents low in fat and high in yummy 
goodness. The prices are always low, 
with the most expensive meal — an 
entree, salad and drink special — 
coming in at just over six bucks. For 
penny-pinching college students, a 
cheap, revitalizing meal is the perfect 
cure for a Monday morning hangover 
or an all-night study session. 

Since Club Med — as it name 
implies — is situated on the Medical 
School campus, many research scien-
tists mix with students while enjoying 
a quality meal. This presents an envi-
ronment in which undergraduates 
can intermingle with professionals in 
a friendly, nonacademic setting. 

The average student might have 
difficulties approaching a professor 
or administrator to ask a science-
related question, but a piping-hot 
bowl of minestrone or a Brooklyn-
style grilled Reuben can unite all 
walks of life. 

Club Med’s destruction will elimi-
nate a beneficial outlet for science 
majors, and add to the tensions and 
stresses felt by those pursuing a career 
in the medical field.

While understandably disappoint-
ed with UCSD’s decision to close 
Club Med, Dauphin was content to 
know that the bureaucracy respon-
sible for deciding its fate is inherently  
very slow moving; previous deadlines 
set by the school regarding past din-
ing-hall closures were usually never 
met on time. 

Hopefully Dauphin’s prediction 
holds true and Club Med will be able 
to stay open as long as possible, mak-
ing sure to dish up a few more Indian 
curry rice bowls and antipasti salads 
before falling victim to the bulldozers 
of bad taste buds.

6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2008

Another one of Obama’s cam-
paign slogans is “Yes We Can,” a 
statement intended to show his 
belief in the collective action of all 
Americans and their crucial role in 
bringing about change. What most 
people don’t realize is that “Yes We 
Can” is not Obama’s invention, but 
is actually borrowed from the age-
old chant of the Latino commu-
nity: ¡Si Se Puede! The irony of his 
slogan’s roots mirrors his proposed 
treatment of la raza Latina. Obama 
is willing to offer driver licenses to 
undocumented immigrants already 
living in the states, but supports 
constructing a wall along the U.S.-
Mexico border to keep out unwanted 
Latinos. Apparently Obama is will-
ing to plagiarize an entire culture 
but does not want to grant residency 
to the community that originally 
penned the phrase on which his 
campaign is based. 

Obama claims to be a champion 
of civil rights and the only candi-
date that can take America in the 
right direction to bring about racial 
equality. Yet when the issue of racial 
subjugation takes place outside 
of American borders, the senator 
doesn’t seem to hesitate in embold-
ening racial divides. After the state 

of Israel essentially quarantined the 
Gaza Strip and its Arab inhabitants, 
Obama openly sympathized with the 
quasi-apartheid actions of Israel. In a 
letter to the Palestinian ambassador 
regarding Israel’s denial of food and 
medicine to 1.5 million people and 
the cutting off the electricity to the 
entire Gaza Strip, Obama claimed, 
“We have to understand why Israel 
is forced to do this.” Purposefully 
starving displaced peoples and refus-
ing to grant one in seven Palestinians 
access to urgent medical treatment is 
not self defense, as Obama said — it’s 
a crime. 

So while I count myself one of the 
many Americans enchanted by the 
language and abilities of the young, 
inspiring senator, I have also realized 
that it is necessary to look beyond 
his poignant words and promises. 
If Obama becomes our next presi-
dent and succeeds in bringing about 
serious change in America and the 
world, I will tip my proverbial cap 
to him and rescind these critiques. 
But if he arrives in the Oval Office 
and his once-captivating ideals fail 
to fulfill their potential, Obama will 
have betrayed the American public 
in an unparalleled fashion that will 
surely kill any remaining faith in our 
nation and its governing body. 

functioning — 9.3 percent had seri-
ously considered suicide and about 1.3 
percent had actually attempted it.

Apply these statistics to UCSD’s 
undergraduate population and about 
9,000 students could use help, 2,000 
should definitely seek help and 300 
are in desperate need of fast help. 
Additionally, according to Rue, 8 per-
cent — about 1,800 enrolled students 
— have used P&CS. 

Looks like a walk-in psychologist 
would have droves of students to work 
with. 

Unfortunately, it’s likely that not all 
these students will seek the help they 
may need. But a walk-in psychologist 
would help soothe the already over-
whelmed professionals here at UCSD, 
who are swamped with more patients 
than they can handle. If students don’t 
use the walk-in service for immedi-
ate counseling the new psychologist 
can take some appointments that have 
been promised at a later date. In this 
way a walk-in psychologist can surely 
be most efficiently used.  

It’s no wonder that P&CS is over-
whelmed; 1,600 students is a lot for 
a handful of professionals to handle. 
Appointments would be necessary to 
manage the influx of students need-
ing help. But forcing students to wait 
weeks before seeing a counselor does 
them more harm then good. 

Beyond discussion of a walk-in 
service, Rue expressed her own plans 
to better the mental health system to 
the council. She said UCSD students 
have a 3.5-percent higher likelihood 
of being diagnosed with anxiety dis-
orders than students nationwide. Rue 
wants to combat anxiety by promot-
ing the wellness center — a P&CS 
resource that encourages physical and 

emotional well-being and provides 
groups, workshops, outreach and help 
with relaxation and stress-manage-
ment techniques. 

Additionally, Rue is planning to 
train student advisers and faculty 
members to recognize and address 
distress from students early on, which 
will allow psychologists to handle 
more extreme cases.

These ideas are all valid; the well-
ness center in an excellent resource and 
a staff trained to help overwhelmed

May Not Live Up to the Hype

Stressed Students, Swamped Staff Need Walk-In Doc
▶ HEALTH, from page 4 students is certainly ideal. But even 

with these improvements students will 
still need — and have to wait far too 
long for — professional help.

After all, if a student is distressed 
enough to actually seek help or be 
noticed by a faculty member, chances 
are the student is sincerely in need 
of professional help. Talking regular-
ly with friendly student adviser and 
spending time at wellness centers are 
good preventative measures, but they 
cannot help students who have never 
had time or the confidence to actu-
ally take these steps. If someone needs 
immediate professional help, then 
wellness centers or counseling will not 
be able to do much. 

Rue has great ideas, and she’s taking 
a vital step forward to bring students a 
higher quality of psychological help, 
but UCSD needs to stop sugarcoating 
the problem. Students need more effi-
cient help, and the university should 
invest in the campus’ well-being and 
hire professionals to give immediate 
attention to students in need. 

It is ridiculous that distressed 
students have to wait weeks, if not 
months, to get professional attention. 
Yes, implementing a walk-in psychol-
ogist may be costly, but the expense is 
surely worth it.

THE BEST SONGS 

IN HIATUS 
THIS WEEK

H oroscopes, crossword puzzles and investigative journalism are typical components of any American newspaper. One Bay Area serial killer’s fetish for this triad mixes in 
with as many as 37 self-confessed murders. In David Fincher’s 
(“Fight Club,” “Se7en”) enigmatic true-crime tragedy, the 
landscape of past films shift from the chiaroscuro of New 
York to the sunny climate, yellow taxicabs and sulfur 
lamps of San Francisco.

“Zodiac” is the decade-spanning study of a 
few mens’ obsessive toil; Robert Graysmith (Jake 
Gyllenhaal), David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and 
Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) are three San 
Franciscans mesmerized by the murders and 
driven to solve the crimes. Yet, the persever-
ance of the trio’s undertaking becomes a liabil-
ity as it wears down to blunt torment. The murder’s 
taunting sport consumes them. In an era when things 
are accomplished through the ambition of the American will, 
the need to solve the puzzle poisons their lives. It isn’t until each 
amputates their manic search that they can begin to rebuild the lives 
they left behind. 

The film’s color palette bewitchingly defines both its period and  
sinister atmosphere. Interior mustards and manilas meld with tones of 
disabled vibrancy throughout. Although the murders take place in the 
Golden State, Fincher’s California is cynically portrayed as anemic dur-
ing the day and saturated in ink at night.

A remarkable addition to the film is also its labyrinthine composi-
tion. Scenes are loaded with a minutia of imagery, from coded messages 
inscribed along glass windows (“Be Careful, Safety First”) to countless 
motifs (maps, numbers, flags) that resemble a Jasper Johns exhibition. 
A transitory figure of the dada and pop art movements, Johns’ art 
resonates fittingly with the meaningless and media-crazed hype of the 
Zodiac murders and his decade.

Fincher’s dark encapsulation of the late ’60s and ’70s is a film both 
unappreciated and exacting. A masterful rendition of American crime, 
“Zodiac” captures and challenges its audience just as well as any murder-
ous puzzle on the front page of the San Francisco Chronicle.

J uno was a good movie, sure, but the Oscar nod got a lot of people upset, and understandably so. It’s been pointed out before — the film’s first 15 minutes are unforgivable. 
I figured I was in for an hour and a half of forced, seemingly “hip” 
wordplay. “Honest to blog”? That fucking hamburger phone? 

Fortunately, the movie is less cringe-inducing after those initial 
bumps. But its forced, intellectual eccentricity rears its head again and 
again, perhaps most notably with its soundtrack — made up of songs 
with lyrics so corny and in-your-face quirky, it initially  seems like a 
joke. It isn’t. 

Wait, isn’t one of the lead character’s really cool qualities that she has 
good taste in music? How did she let this happen?

Juno does prove to be a charming and original character, one worthy of 
our sympathy, despite having a voice and attitude all too reminiscent of my 
ex-girlfriend’s. However, Michael Cera’s character — if you can even call 
it that at this point — is bascially a rehash of his character in “Superbad,” 
which is a knock-off of his character in “Arrested Development.” 

The point is this — how quirky and original can you be if you get 
caught trying way too hard? Trust me, not very.

H ey Quentin Tarantino, shut the fuck up. Instead of the awesome headliner to an amazing collection of 
schlocky gore and nostalgic exploitation, “Death Proof ” proved to be this 
year’s biggest Debbie Downer, and the worst blow is the unexpectedness 
of Tarantino’s utter failure. He’s like the steadfast boyfriend who always 
opens your door and pays the bills, but then tells you he knocked up your 
mom. After the mischievous bloodshed of “Planet Terror” and the outra-
geous melee of mock trailers, the atmosphere seems primed for Tarantino’s 
notorious violence. But instead of delivering the intensity of “Kill Bill,” 
Tarantino punishes us with the drudgery of a DMV instructional video.

The film itself is a masturbatory stroll through the overrun garden 
of dialogue permeating Tarantino’s brain. It can be broken down into 
a film about chicks discussing random girlie shit at bars and diners, 
encounter a weirdo stuntman (Kurt Russell) and try to survive his 
murderous efforts to kill them with his fancy stunt car. Shampoo, 
rinse and repeat. The only shocking element to the story is the 
disproportionate amount of time dedicated to utterly meaningless 

banter. What is the point of hearing about Arlene’s woes if she’s only going 
to be burned alive in a car wreck 10 minutes later? Anyone? Anyone?

If this film teaches us anything, it’s that Tarantino is one creepy dude. 
In his oddly lecherous tracking shots, it becomes apparent that he not only 
enjoys lingering over his actress’ nubile bodies, but he also has a little bit 
of a foot fetish going on. His focused attention on Sydney Poitier’s dainty 
piggies or Vanessa Ferlito’s ankles as she leans back in her chair is more 
than a little bit awkward. 

What could have been a classy murder romp featuring an aging stud 
and a buffet of fly honeys became a tedious end to an otherwise entertain-
ing feature. It’s too bad Tarantino got sidetracked booty trolling instead of 
writing a movie that’s, you know, watchable.

W hat do Anna Wintour, Willy Wonka, the Little Lad in the Starburst Berries & Creme com-mercial and Javier Bardem have in common? Besides being creepy as hell, they all sport that ridiculous pageboy haircut. After all, 
what can be more fearsome than a maniac brandishing a cattle-killing 
pressurized weapon sporting locks taht would make He-Man jealous? 
In “No Country for Old Men,” Bardem haunts Josh Brolin as a sinister, 
psychopathic killer, yet one can’t help but imagine Bardem running 
in place, decked out in a Victorian-era schoolboy outfit, clapping his 
hands like an idiot while singing, “Berries & Creme, Berries & Creme, 
I’m a little lad who loves Berries & Creme!” in alternating octaves. 
Pegged to win the Oscar for supporting actor, Bardem doesn’t have to 
act the haircut — the haircut acts itself.

I t’s not often that a middle-aged man in 300-pound drag does it for a girl, but when you take the icon that is John Travolta and give him 
breasts, it’s kind of hard not to notice the sexy. As 
Edna Turnblad, a role made famous by legendary 
drag queen Ms. Divine, Travolta hams it up playing a 
housewife in racially turbulent 1960s Baltimore. 

Like the sexy shim-beasts before him, (“Tootsie,” 
“Mrs. Doubtfire”) Travolta proves that there’s some-
thing kind of magical about a leading man wearing 
a dress and looking exactly like a dude … wear-
ing a dress. Without a whisker in sight, there’s still 
something that just isn’t quite right about this lady. 
Hair? Makeup? Oh wait, no — it’s the penis bulging 
through her skirt.

But mad props are in order for a man who donned 
30 pounds of prosthetics day after day to realize John 
Waters’ dream. So what if his plastic boobs are no more 
believable then Zac Efron’s man tan? At least his nurturing bosom is a welcome 
respite from the musical bastardization of the director’s cult classic. So lay on 
the Maybelline, baby, and then lay on me.WORST FILMdEATH pROOF

I f I recall, the last time I opened the door to a used piece-of-shit Chevy, it didn’t turn into Puff the magic robot — at least not when I wasn’t high on PCP. But for some reason, the 
transformer of the 21st century seems to like American consum-
erism — er, cars — and decides to brand a Chevy badge as it saves 
the world one corporate sponsor at a time. 

In Michael Bay’s feature-length commercial, “Transformers,” 
product placement dominates the screen while autobots and 
decepticons reenact the scenes you’d always imagined as a kid, 
clenching Optimus Prime in one hand and Megatron in the 
other. The cinematic descendant of Steven Spielberg’s big-budget 

blockbusters, Bay’s blend of CGI and expensive studio sets makes 
audience members feel like they’re watching a hipper version of 
“Power Rangers.”

The film, and many like it, targets the same group of movie 
goers who can’t seem to find anything more stimulating than 
their childhood fantasies — as if their mental capacity to enjoy 
film peaked in fourth grade.

Overly reliant on explosions and PG-13 humor, “Transformers” 
never ceases to commercialize. It’s amazing what credits can 
do to make you forget you’ve just sat through 144 minutes of 
Chevrolet’s latest marketing campaign.

WORST ENDING
nATIONAL tREASURE 2

by jeff wang staff writer

M itch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) had everything to live for, and, had he survived the flooded chamber underneath Mount Rushmore, he would have become the founder 
of the City of Lost Gold and would have successfully smeared 
dirt over Thomas Gates’ (Nicolas Cage) family name.

Mitch was in a classic villain’s demise scenario: in an 
Indiana Jones-esque chamber of death where water is flooding 
in and the only escape route had to be opened by two people, 
the great grandson of John Wilkes Booth had a blade on 
Thomas’ love interest’s throat. Instead of ordering two of the 
five helpless history nerds to pry open the gates and getting 
himself out, he freed Abigail, opened the gates and told his 
newly found best friend Thomas to run for it. This is a Disney 
movie, but come on, even Cruella can do better.

From the Mitch bandits’ merciless shooting attempts and 
the car chases to try to get clues from the treasure hunter, 
it’s not terrible to imagine an alternate, and possibly much 
sweeter ending, in which Mitch leaves Thomas behind to 
drown and maybe kills off the rest of his family to cover up 
his insane crimes.

T he Bourne Ultimatum,” the final install-ment in the Jason Bourne series, was nothing short of a critical and commer-
cial success. However, despite the franchise’s 
history of incredible action sequences and 
engaging storylines, and despite the fact that it 
crafted possibly one of the most satisfying con-
clusions in any recent movie trilogy, it would 
be awfully misleading to acknowledge the film’s 
blockbuster status without paying tribute to 
the true cause of its success: Matt Damon’s 
immaculate head.

Remember the first time you feasted your 
eyes on the teaser poster — the back of Matt 
Damon’s head beautifully centered upon the 
skyline of New York City, glowing in your eyes 
like the Arc of the Covenant. It wasn’t until the 
moment you had set your gaze upon Damon’s 
majestic dome that you realized the true power 

he held in attracting anyone and everyone to his 
films. What is it about Matt Damon’s head that 
makes it so special, so irresistible? Perhaps 
it’s the unique geometric design — neither a 
rectangle nor an oval, yet something subtly in 
between. Or maybe it’s that the unique geom-
etry constantly teases the existence of a beauti-
ful yet forbidden organic shape that only Matt 
Damon could ever acquire. 

Not even People magazine could deny the 
cultural impact of his cranium, naming the 
Oscar-winner “Sexiest Man Alive.” So congratu-
lations, Matt Damon, you indeed had the best 
head of 2007.

M ichael Cera is just hands down, bar none the absolute fucking best at playing Michael Cera. No one can 
stutter and make otherwise-normal situa-
tions awkward like he can, except for Ben 
Stiller a few years back when he was doing 
the same thing. Whether he’s George Michael 
Bluth, Paulie Bleeker or Evan (his “Superbad” 
character — there’s no way anyone would 
remember that), Cera is a socially inept mess 
who is somehow lovable despite hardly being 
able to carry on a conversation like a normal 
human being. 

There was a dude just like this at my high school. 
I recall that I wanted so badly to throttle him and 
ask him precisely what the fuck his problem was; 
conversation isn’t that difficult. I would probably 
do the same to Cera, but he has started to show that 
he is capable of doing better. In the online shorts 
“Michael Cera Gets Fired from Knocked Up” and 
“Impossible is the Opposite of Possible,” Cera shows 
that he can play an arrogant prick, and do a great 
job of it. Let’s hope that screenwriters know how to 
use the Internet.

It won the Palme d’Or at last year’s Cannes 
Film Festival, appeared in the number-one slot in 
most top 10 lists, and yet, when Oscar nominations 
rolled around, Cristian Mungiu’s gripping, bleak 
drama set during a brutal dictatorship in 1980s 
Romania was curiously left without an nod. “Juno” 
this ain’t, as Mungiu weaves together the tale of 
college student Otilia who, over the course of 24 
hours, races to procure an illegal abortion for 

her roommate, Gabita. “Four Months” is deeply 
rooted in its time period, ironically known as the 
“Golden Age of Romania,” using the omnipresent 
governmental oppression to backlight the political 
and moral state, and undercurrent, of a culture in 
silent turmoil. 

Stick it to the Academy this weekend with this 
shunned piece of art, playing for one week only at

I n case you haven’t noticed, Judd Apatow has a penis fetish. Like Tarantino with feet and Woody Allen with children, Apatow 
always makes sure a wiener pops out at some 
point during his films, literally or in spirit. 
With Jonah Hill’s elaborate childhood draw-
ings in “Superbad” and the accompanying 
penis montage in the credits, 2007 was the 
year dicks made a comedy comeback. But 

Apatow truly erected his stature with 
an infamous 

cock cameo in “Walk Hard,” during which 
John C. Reilly’s Dewey Cox (again, cocks) 
takes a hungover phone call in a hotel room 
with a flaccid wang behind him. 

That penis, ladies and gentlemen, is owned, 
operated and maintained by none other than 
Mr. Apatow himself. It takes a lot of balls 
to show your member on 30-feet Cineplex 
screens all across the country; a lot of balls 
and a lot of heart.

S omewhere between midnight screenings of “300” and the inevitable post-party circle jerk, Dane Cook crept in as every beer-
swindling bro, junior yacht jockey and hanger-on’s 
favorite funnyman. Sure, he’s been around for a 
good majority of the decade, with plenty of album 
paperweights and HBO specials to skip, but last 
year marked the great surge of Dane Cook satura-
tion in our fragile media, with three — count ’em, 
three — feature films. The first two, “Dan In Real 
Life” and “Mr. Brooks,” shouldn’t really count, 
given Cook’s supporting status (not that it aided 
either of the snoozers). But it’s his magnum opus, 
“Good Luck Chuck,” reeking of his loudmouth 
humor and aloof presence, which proves the 
most odious, obnoxious and downright offensive. 
Granted, had the film been rewritten, recast and 
reshot, you could’ve potentially had a decent hear-
kening back to old-fashioned screwball comedies.

What people fail to realize about Cook 
is that he’s not a comedian 

at all. He’s 

a technician. He knows what people want to hear 
— what annoying sounds, drunken asides and 
obtuse kicking rile up an audience that has already 
pregamed itself out of rational coherence. Cook is 
a master, finely tuning each vocal chord to please 
the inebriated. There aren’t any nuggets of humor-
ous truth or logical absurdity, the kind instilled 
in people we deem to be the greatest comedians 
of all time (Carlin, Pryor, Seinfeld, Cross). No, it’s 
just stupidity. Not because it’s funny, but because 
it plays well with people who can’t think in the 
first place.

Need proof? Just go to any party touting mul-
tiple kegs, whisper a quick remark about working 
at the “BK Lounge,” and watch how fast the event 
descends into manic, liquored, arm-flapping chaos 
with all the intensity of caged wild animals, like a 
sick sociology experiment chronicling the collapse 
of western civilization. It’s a brutal sight, but given 
a youth culture that counts a hangover as success, 
it’s not too surprising.

ZACH BRAFF AWARD FOR
ACHIEVEMENT IN DOUCHEBAGGERY

dANE cOOK

W hen was the last time a sheepish hair-line made you blush? This award was a long time coming for Nicolas Cage’s 
current state of follicle glory, and we can finally 
thank “National Treasure 2” for capturing its 
styled essence in full. Broiling in a plot about the 
Lincoln assassination, some mysterious myster-
ies and maybe Aztec gold or whatever, Cage’s 
hair is finally center stage and in it to win it. 
The movie features Cage’s best man extensions, 
receding hairline shine and thinning fluff to 
date, even after equally stellar romps earlier in 
the year, with “Next” and “Ghost Rider.” Not 
even the movie’s two-dimensional baddie, Ed 

Harris, can handle the fierceness of Cage’s coif. 
That’s why he dies, well that and maybe the fact 
that he sacrificed himself at the end.

Whatever the case for the sexual reduction 
of tuft, it will take more then one insipid sequel 
to make Cage pull a Bruce Willis on us and 
hacksaw his wispy man-mane. Don’t you quit 
on us, hair; we need you to prove that we can 
get through the bad times, like the unavoidable 
third installment to the “National Treasure” 
series which is probably on its way to the week-
end box office right now.

THIS WEEK’S PIPING HOT SPECIAL: 

Atlas Sound
■ Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See but Cannot Feel
KRANKY

B radford Cox, the lovesick Marfan Syndrome sufferer from drone-pop band Deerhunter, wants to share all of his secrets. As a product of the blog generation, he 
candidly explains deeply personal issues in interviews and 
posts about his debut solo album under the Atlas Sound 
moniker, the mouthful Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can 
See but Cannot Feel. 

Taking the opportunity to experiment with tones not 
within Deerhunter’s more traditional spectrum, Cox envel-
ops us in a hazy swirl of ambient samples and techno con-
ventions. In “Quarantined,” he repeats the same two lonely 
phrases until the blasted arena drums drop in and bring the 
song to a drugged climax. It’s a transcendent experience to 
hear Cox’s vulnerable voice ricochet off the mellow world 
of echoing keys and percussive flourishes. Unfortunately, 
after a few songs with the same format of breathy vocals 
foreshadowing an instrumental crescendo, it becomes 

somewhat worn and predictable.
Cox focuses almost none of his creative energy on the 

vocal melodies, which makes for a few forgettable tracks 
with shoddy one-line choruses. “Cold As Ice,” for example, 
is just a repetition of the song title in a dry, unfeeling mono-
tone, ostensibly recorded in one quick take. Gripes aside, he 
proves he can write hook-heavy tunes with the traditional 
’60s lounger “Ativan.” It blends a detached pop sensibility 
with cool reverb all over the mix, evoking teenage cruises 
after dark. In many ways, Atlas Sound is to Deerhunter 
as Thom Yorke’s solo work is to Radiohead — more beat 
oriented, less structurally complex and with minimized 
quality control. It’s an intriguing and revealing diversion, 
but these eccentric artists create better work with other 
musicians keeping them in check.

FILM REVIEW: Michel Gondry’s “Be Kind Rewind”

Geisel university librarian and Campus 
Web Site Executive Committee chair, 
said in an e-mail. “This will include 
all of the code, graphics, templates and 
documentation needed to quickly and 
easily build Web sites that integrate 
seamlessly with the new UC San Diego 
home page.”

Visitors can expect to see the addi-
tion of departments and new content 
within the next six to 12 months. 

Schottlaender said that feedback 
on the redesigned site has been mostly 
positive.

“We’re seeing a bell curve of 
responses, strong positive feedback 
along with some confusion, but overall 
indications show us that students like it 
better than the old site,” he said.

Additions that students have 
labeled helpful include more informa-
tion about on-campus events and the 
addition of the athletics schedule to the 
TritonLink home page.

However, some students and staff 
members involved in producing the 
site have criticized it for having notice-
able flaws, saying it fails to address 
content concerns in order to please 
users.

“I think the committee really need-
ed to spend a lot of time looking at 
what information was actually going 

to be available on the new site,” former 
ACT Security Engineer D.J. Capelis 
said. “The navigation needed to be 
built around the content they had to 
present, not who they were present-
ing it to.”

Capelis said the site’s weaknesses 
stem from the content management 
system used to develop it, called 
Vignette, which requires specific 
knowledge to operate it. The system 
minimizes the chances of rapid alter-
ations, or changes made by depart-
ments without members that have 
received the training necessary to 
operate it.

“Vignette simply allows the organi-
zation with the content to communi-
cate it with an audience, not the actual 
person who is in the best position to 
create it,” Capelis said.

Sections of the Web site that have 
not yet been developed as planned 
include the “My TritonLink” page, a 
student profile page that will display 
money owed, a current class schedule 
and any holds on a student’s account. 
While the page has been advertised for 
weeks as launching at the beginning 
of Winter Quarter, it is instead now 
expected to appear sometime before 
the close of the term.

“There is additional testing required 
to make sure students can success-

fully sign off of TritonLink if they are 
using public labs before we can fully 
activate the My TritonLink feature,” 
Schottlaender said. “This is to protect 
student privacy.”

Another issue confronting admin-
istrators is the lack of a sign-off option 
when students are using the tools 
listed on the TritonLink homepage. 
While the sign-off link is available on 
the tools themselves, it is missing from 
pages that students access through the 
tool they are currently using, making 
it difficult to sign out of the entire 
site. 

Providing useful content on the 
TritonLink home page to all the dif-
ferent possible viewers that access 
the Web site has proved a difficult 
task to accomplish without cluttering 
the homepage with extraneous links, 
Schottlaender said. 

“We have a diverse base of constitu-
ents and users — all different people 
who visit the UC San Diego Web site 
for different reasons,” he said. “Trying 
to provide adequate tools and informa-
tion to satisfy as many of those visitors 
as possible while still maintaining a 
clean, clear and usable site was and 
remains a difficult endeavor.”

WEB EXCLUSIVE: “Be Kind Rewind”
By Edwin Gonzalez
Staff Writer

Revival and renaissance lie at the heart of “Be Kind Rewind,” the newest film from the traditionally surrealist director of “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” Michel Gondry. Although 
the film performs on a much less formalistic level, its ardor for the small town marginalized by the corrupted city is both apparent and inspiring.

Mike (Mos Def), best friend Jerry (Jack Black) and girl-next-door Alma (Melonie Diaz) form the trio that propel the film’s curious premise. After being magnetized as a result of a whacky 
stunt, Jerry unknowingly erases all of the footage in the Be Kind Rewind VHS rental store. In order to convince proprietor Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover) not to give up hope in the face of 
commercial urbanization, the two best friends take a chance on an outlandish idea that eventually brings more customers to the store than anything else they’ve ever done: donning various 
homemade costumes, they re-film each movie. 

The group’s renditions of countless movies are capricious, comic and creatively entertaining. Imagining and rearticulating new meaning and significance to the community’s love of film, the 
twenty-minute remakes become an outlet for the town’s personal sense of collective identity. Outside of these scenes, however, the plot-generating narrative comes off as campy and something 
like the themed episode of an ’80s sitcom where the main character tries to save the school’s oldest tree.

Set against the theoretical backdrop of the Harlem Renaissance, “Be Kind Rewind” extols the virtues of a community’s collective effort to define itself through its art. The movie remakes 
may start out with just Mike, Jerry and Alma, but they quickly progress into comedic adventures starring many of the store’s best customers. And unlike the original movies their films are based 
on, the remakes are imbued with post-modern personality. The films create a modern story of one small, forgettable town’s spontaneous rebirth which eventually culminates in a Capraesque 
ending. 

Passaic, the quaint and retrograde town in New Jersey, is where it all takes place; a small town where, pleasantly, all its citizens are unaestheticized by celebrities and Hollywood glamour, 
where small side characters look like the lady you passed by in the theater lobby or a friend’s uncle you met once at a family gathering. Notably the county where William Carlos Williams’ 
Paterson resides — the location of his epic poem of the same name, celebrating his own American small-town home — Passaic also has its own minor claim to fame in the story of legendary 
musician Fats Waller.

 
Although it has the same narrative themes as “Barbershop,” Gondry’s wit and spirited originality help redeem the film’s tired sincerity (and some of Mos Def ’s acting). Glorifying films made 

with heart and for the creators’ personal viewing pleasure (as opposed to the commercialization of mainstream studio pictures), he explores the democratic versatility of the video camera. 

“Be Kind Rewind” is neither Gondry’s best work nor the most powerful movie experience, but it should at least be appreciated for its innovative and unique approach to small-town dilem-
mas. Encouraging a renaissance of creative energy in every American community, it implores future films to be personable and personal again — and turn the credits into a list of everyone 
who attended your birthday last year.

14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2008

things like getting your first serve in 
and keeping the ball away from the net 
man on the return are important,” he 
said. “Most of the time, the team that 
can keep their head together during 
the most crucial moments wins those 
close matches.  I’m just proud me and 
Placek were able to score a huge win 
on our team.”

Having seized the momentum with 
the crucial win at No. 3 doubles, the 
Tritons used the lift to carry them 
through an exciting and extremely 
competitive singles portion. Four of 
the six matches went the distance and 
UCSD won half of the contests to 
secure the victory.  

Steidlmayer was quick to compli-
ment his team on the important win.

“I’ve really tried to challenge my 
team in the past few weeks, and that 
hard work finally showed up in our 
match against Abilene Christian,” he 
said.  “The way our No. 3 doubles 
team fought to win that tiebreaker was 
a huge pick-me-up, heading into the 
singles.  We needed every ounce of 
energy for the singles.  Winning 3-set-
ters in the way we did really speaks to 
how well this team can play when their 
backs are against the wall.”  

At No. 1 singles, Moallemi 
rebounded from a tough first-set loss 
to post a 6-7, 6-3, 6-3 victory over 
Nunez.  Number two singles was 
just as thrilling with Rubens pull-
ing through over Hudson 6-4, 4-6, 
7-6. Negishi outlasted Hawk in a 
three-hour thriller at No. 3, taking 
the match 6-7, 6-2, 7-5. Meister was 
able to keep the team rolling at No. 
4 singles, defeating Joey Farias, 7-6, 
6-2. Abilene Christian was able to 
win the final two singles matches at 
the fifth and sixth spots, but it was 
not enough. Joiner was able to take 
out sophomore Vince Nguyen in yet 
another three-set match at the five 
spot, 5-7, 6-2, 6-3. Number six singles 
wasn’t much of a contest, with UCSD

senior Alex Whitmore falling to Brett 
Proctor 6-0, 6-1. 

UCSD next took on Hawaii-Hilo on 
Feb. 17. The Tritons set the tone early, 
winning all three doubles contests in 
routine fashion, putting them in control 
of the match.  Rubens and Meister beat 
their opponents’ top doubles duo 8-4. 
In No. 2 doubles, Placek and Becker 
took out the Hawaii-Hilo duo of Luiz 
Gonzaga and Mangal Sriram 8-3. In the 
final doubles match, freshmen Armaun 
Emami and Alex Edstrom continued 
their emergence as a doubles team to 
be reckoned with, scoring an impres-
sive 8-5 win.

Moallemi held down the top singles 
spot, taking down Laurent Colombo 6-
3, 6-4.  Rubens, who has been battling 
foot injuries recently, didn’t show any 
lingering effects during a 6-3, 7-6 win. 
Negishi was able to pull out another 
nail-biter at the third spot, coming 
from behind for a 3-6, 6-3, (11-9) win. 
Meister had the quickest match of the 
day in singles, getting by Sriram 6-3, 
6-0 at the fourth spot. Once again, 
UCSD dropped the five and six singles 
matches, but it didn’t affect the out-
come of the match. 

Although Steidlmayer was proud 
of his team’s effort in Arizona, he was 
quick to point out that there is still a 
long way to go, and that the Tritons 
have a lot of improving to do. 

“Obviously, going undefeated when 
you travel out-of state is something to 
be proud of,” he said. “Most of all, I’m 
proud of the way our guys fought hard 
to win the tough ones.  Wins like that 
are a sign of growth, and we will be able 
to use the lessons learned from these 
taxing matches down the road.”

The Tritons had their home match 
on Wednesday against Concordia 
rained out, but will return to the courts 
today when they travel to face Division-
I opponent Loyola Marymount.

Junior first-baseman Jenni Habib has started all 14 games for the Tritons and leads the team in batting average and RBIs, hitting.412 and driving in 11 as UCSD is off to a fantastic 11-3 overall start.

UCSD No-Hit in Finals of  Schutt Sports Leadoff  Classic

getting on runs where the team can get 
four to six sideouts in row will make a 
huge difference.

The development continues this 
week when the Tritons face 2003 
National Champion Lewis University 
Feb. 22 and No. 11 Loyola-Chicago 
University on Feb. 23. 

Although UCSD is 0-4 all-time 
against Lewis, Ring believes that this 
year’s squad offers a good opportunity 
to change that.

“We’re going through the [scouting 
reports] right now,” he said. “Lewis has 
been playing some top opponents close 
but isn’t comparable to the upper teams 
in the [MPSF].”

Last season, the Flyers outlasted the 
Tritons in five games at RIMAC Arena. 
Lewis has faced two MPSF teams this 
year, losing both matches.

The Tritons then travel to face 
Loyola-Chicago, a team that they have 
not seen since 2005, when the Ramblers 
trampled UCSD in a three-game sweep. 
UCSD’s lone victory against Loyola-
Chicago came back in 1996.

The Ramblers are off to a solid 
start in the Midwest Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Association and three of 
their losses have come in five games. 
Ring noted how competitive Loyola-
Chicago has been against good teams 
and doesn’t want to treat the contest 
any different than a normal conference 
match.

“It doesn’t matter whether it’s con-
ference or nonconference, our goal is 
to win both matches,” he said. “We had 
an open weekend in our schedule and 
filled it with two competitive teams.” 

The Tritons will travel away from 
California for only the second time this 
season and while Ring said traveling 
takes its toll, he expects the team to 
perform well. The trip to Romeoville, 
Ill. will be UCSD’s last away game as the 
Tritons will return home for a stretch of 
nine games at RIMAC Arena.

Break From 
MPSF Next

again gave Ward the nod and the 
veteran team leader responded with 
her first career no-hitter. 

The Tritons used Lukk’s fourth 
inning homer and Ward’s six strike-
out no-no to beat 
Dixie College 
State 1-0, send-
ing them to the 
c h a m p i o n s h i p 
game versus Barry 
University.

“[The no-hit-
ter was] exciting,” 
Ward said. “I’ve 
gotten close a cou-
ple of times so it 
felt great to get a 
no-hitter in before 
I graduate.”

In a cruel twist 
of irony, UCSD witnessed the sec-
ond no-hitter of the day, but this 
time from the losing end. Just hours 
after Ward’s gem, Barry’s Megan 

and sailed the ball down the right 
field line, allowing Maze to try third 
base on the initial error. The right 
fielder picked up the loose ball and 
fired it across the field to get the 
lead runner out, but once again the 
throw sailed wide, this time allow-
ing Lukk to advance from first to 
second. Against all odds, the oppos-
ing fielder tried to nail Lukk at 
second and, sticking with tradition, 
overthrew the bag, allowing Maze 
to easily trot home from third as the 
winning run.

“Once the throwing errors 
began, I really wasn’t thinking, but 
instead just running on instinct and 
adrenaline,” Lukk said. “Of course, 
once I realized Maze had made it 
home I was stoked. We had played a 
great game and it was good to get a 
great team win.”

In the semifinal game on the 
morning of Feb. 16, Gerckens once

win the tournament championship.

“It was good to play well but it’s 
unfortunate that we couldn’t take 
the whole thing,” Gerckens said. 

“Our bats kind 
of cooled down 
toward the end of 
the tournament. 
[Young] was a 
good pitcher, 
but we just need 
to learn how to 
make adjust-
ments quicker.”

A second-
place finish in 
a tough tourna-
ment is nothing 
to scoff at, but 
the Tritons are 

aware that a more balanced attack 
will bring them first-place success.

“We were able to have a great 
weekend with a few clutch hits, but 

there is even more offense in this 
team that is ready to bust out in the 
future,” Lukk said. “All we have to do 
is stay relaxed, stay confident, and 
play like we have nothing to lose.”

The Tritons took on Division-I 
cross-town rival University of San 
Diego in a doubleheader on Feb. 20. 
UCSD lost the first game 1-4 but 
responded and came back from a 
four-run first inning hole to beat the 
Toreros 6-5 in the nightcap. More 
details were unavailable at press 
time.

Next, the Tritons will host Cal 
State Dominguez Hills in a four-
game series over the weekend before 
hitting the road for another four-
game series against Cal State San 
Bernardino as they hit the heart of 
their California Collegiate Athletic 
Association schedule.

HOT CORNER

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2008

By Jake Blanc
Senior Staff Writer

SOFTBALL — After a disappoint-
ing weekend split against confer-
ence rival Chico State, the UCSD 
softball team used a week of qual-
ity practices to regroup and refo-
cus. The Tritons’ back-to-basics 
approach paid off as they placed 
second at the Schutt Sports Leadoff 
Classic in Phoenix.

UCSD stormed through the 
pool and bracket play with a per-
fect 5-0 record before falling to 
Barry University in the champion-
ship game. The successful week-
end puts the Tritons’ overall season 
record at 11-3, but even with such 
a commanding win-loss record, the 
Tritons feel like they have yet to 
play to their full potential and are 
expecting to continually improve.

“We still think that we didn’t 
have our strongest weekend again 
[in Arizona],” junior first-baseman 
Jenni Habib said. “But it was good 
for us to know that we can get the 
runs when we need them and back 
up the pitchers and give them the 
support that they deserve.”

The tourney’s opening game 
pitted the Tritons against Grand 
Canyon University. After scoring 
only six runs the entire previous 

weekend versus Chico State, UCSD 
matched that total in one game in a 
shutout victory. 

Senior pitcher Melissa Ward 
threw her second complete game 
shutout of the year while allowing 
only five runners to reach base. 
Pacing UCSD’s offense was sopho-
more catcher Nicole Saari who hit 
her first collegiate homerun, a solo 
shot in the second inning.

UCSD picked up a second win 
later that evening with a clutch 7-4 
win over Missouri Western State. 
After squandering a four-run lead 
in the fifth inning, the Tritons got 
back-to-back hits from Saari and 
sophomore shortstop Amanda 
Eliades with the bases loaded to 
seal the win.

UCSD finished off the last round 
of pool play with another shutout, 
this time thanks to the right arm 
of junior starter Lauren Chastain, 
as she took a no-hitter into the 
seventh inning against New Mexico 
Highlands. 

Habib picked up three RBIs 
while going 3-3 at the plate in the 
team’s 5-0 win, guaranteeing them 
a top seeding for the next round of 
bracket play.

The Tritons entered their Feb. 
15 game needing to go undefeated 
in bracket play to make it to the 
championship. 

The southpaw Ward again took 
the mound, this time against Eastern 
New Mexico University, and again 
threw a complete game shutout. 
Whereas her earlier shutout was 
given plenty of offensive breathing 
room, this victory was made pos-

sible by a bizarre play that would 
have left even Abbot and Costello 
confounded.

Leading off the bottom of the 
seventh in a scoreless game, senior 
third-baseman Jenny Maze singled 
to right. Employing the small-ball 
strategy, head coach Patti Gerckens 
called for the sacrifice bunt to move 
the winning run into scoring posi-
tion. 

Senior second-baseman Danielle 
Lukk placed a perfect bunt down 
the first base line but the crashing 
first-baseman overthrew the bag

UCSD Swept Away By Waves
By Matt Croskey
Senior Staff Writer

VOLLEYBALL — After suffering 
another pair of losses over the three-
day weekend, two nonconference 
games may be just the antidote for the 
UCSD men’s volleyball team.

The Tritons were victorious in only 
one of their last six and are in dire need 
of a momentum change. Last week’s 
matches at No. 9 University of Southern 

SANH LUONG/GUARDIAN FILE
Freshman middle blocker Tyler Kern and the young Tritons will look to end a three-game losing streak 
when they hit the road to take on two nonconference opponents in Romeoville, Ill. on Feb. 22 and 23.

California and No. 7 Pepperdine 
University were no help as UCSD was 
swept 36-34, 30-23, 30-20 and 30-22, 
30-20, 30-24, respectively.

In their match at USC on Feb. 13, 
the Tritons battled hard in game one, 
siding out nine consecutive times to 
push late into the game before the 
Trojans closed it with an ace. In games 
two and three, the Tritons could not 
bounce back, and once again witnessed 
a sweep at the hands of a powerhouse 

Division-I school.
Head Coach Kevin Ring felt the 

teams battled hard, but the Trojans 
played just a little better.

“I thought we played well for 
stretches,” he said. “We sided out, pre-
venting the game from ending about 
nine times, and we battled hard.”

The Pepperdine match proved little 
different from the one the night before. 
The Tritons didn’t match up as well as 
they did in their first contest against 
the Waves this season, when the Waves’ 
All-American was missing.

“We could’ve done some things bet-
ter on our side,” Ring said. “We totaled 
five and a half blocks but they all came 
in the third game. Our hitters didn’t 
always take care of their swings and 
that was the difference.” 

Ring also felt that there were 
stretches where the team played well, 
but couldn’t put together a complete 
match.

“We’re getting one or one-and-a-
half games, but we’re not playing a full 
match of what I call good volleyball,” he 
said. “We’re trying to get a little better 
blocking and strengthen our sideout 
game to allow us to go on runs. You 
have to slow down the other side and 
we just haven’t been able to do that.” 

The two losses drop UCSD to 4-
10 on the season with a single victory 
in conference play. Despite the dismal 
numbers, Ring continues to reiterate 
that this year’s team is still young and 
is still developing the finer aspects of 
the game.

“One aspect of our game that can 
make a big difference right now is 
blocking,” he said. “A block has a big-
ger effect than just that one point. 
Opposing hitters get pressed and it 
forces errors. Our middle blockers are 
young and it’s a skill that takes a while 
to become proficient at.” 

Another area that Ring pointed to 
was the sideout game. He believes that

Triton Tennis Takes Two 
From Wildcats, Vulcans

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN FILE

Senior guard Clint Allard led the team with 14 points on Senior Night but UCSD lost 61-46 on Feb. 16.

By Neil Joshi
Staff Writer

The UCSD men’s tennis team hit 
the road and traveled to Arizona over 
the weekend, going undefeated in two 
matches to improve to 5-1 on the sea-
son. Originally scheduled to play four 
matches, the Tritons settled for only two 
wins against No. 15 Abilene Christian 
and No. 36 Hawaii-Hilo in Phoenix. 
Inclement weather and a cancellation 
caused matches against Brigham Young 
University and Midwestern State to be 
dropped from the program.  

Head coach Eric Steidlmayer asked 
for more from his players, and the 
Tritons responded with 6-3 and 7-2 
victories. Against Abilene Christian on 
Feb. 16, the Tritons came out firing, 
understanding the importance of put-
ting together an impressive showing 

against a nationally ranked opponent. 
In doubles, UCSD took two out of three 
matches to gain the edge before singles 
play began. Seniors Eric Rubens and 
Blake Meister improved to 4-1 at the top 
doubles spot with an 8-4 win over Juan 
Nunez and Ryan Hudson. At the No. 
2 doubles position, Abilene Christian 
evened the match at one apiece when 
Luke Hawk and Hutton Jones beat 
the UCSD duo of junior Kaz Negishi 
and sophomore Bijan Moallemi 8-5. In 
the all-important third doubles match, 
sophomores Alex Placek and Chad 
Becker won a thriller over Brian Joiner 
and Brett Proctor by a score of 9-8.

Becker explained that the key to 
winning tense matches like that is all 
about keeping things simple.  

“When you’re in a dogfight, basic
