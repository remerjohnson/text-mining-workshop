Last month 's Associated 
Students boy ott of campus 
vending mac hines was a 
success, if figures supplied by 
th Housing and Food ervices 
Administration are a n y 
indication. 

Statistics released by that 
office show a one-third decrease 
in machine revenues during 
April , the month of the AS 
boycott. 

However, those same fi gures 
show a sharp increase in 
revenue during the Progressive 
Coalition boycott month of 
Ma rch. 

While students are claiming 
the decrease in use during the 
boycott as a victory for student 
authority, Larry Barrett ,

North City West Project Draws 
Fire from Environmentalists 

By Marc Petrie 
The controversy surrounding 

North City West shows signs of 
heating up as Del Mar receives 
an environmen tal impact 
study's preliminary findings on 
the propo ed development 
Friday. 

North City Wes t is a planned 
community which eventua lly 
will cover 4,000 acres with a 
population of 40,'000, 
according to the proposed 
development's plans. 

"We're concerned," Bob 
Nelson, Del Mar city manager 
said. ''The City of San Diego 
environmental impact report did 
not mention impacts outside the 
city. The main asset of the 
coastal area is the beach , and 
North City West lies in a direct 
line with the beach." 

The San Diego City 
environmental impact report 
was conducted in 1975 to 
determine the impact of the 
proposed development on its 
immediate environment and on 
the city of San Diego. 

The purpose of the new 
report is to raise issues about the 
development's effect on Del 
Mar and to determine the 
positive and negative aspects of 
the project, Nelson said. 

WEATHER 
Continued c1ou~ineu, 

with early moming drizzle and 
some afternoon clearing. 
Winds will be W .SW, 10·16 
knola. 

Breakers of 2·4 feet are 
expected, 'at 14 second 
intervals. The water 
temperature is 63 degrees .

Nelson hopes to delay the 
plan, due June 13 to the San 
Diego City Committee on 
Transportation a nd Land Use , 
until Del Mar ca n " fully pursue" 
the results of the new impact 
study. 

The tudy will investigate 
possible co n g stion and 
crowdi ng a nd its effects on vital 
serv ices such as sewage 
trea tment , school ystems, a nd 
fire and poli ce services, 
according to James Kuebel-
beck, of Williams-Kuebelbeck. 

The study was contracted to 
Wiliiams · Kuebelbeck and 
Criterion, two econometric 
research firms who use 
statistical data to make 
projections and predictions 
about the economic effects of a ,

Saxon to Hold Press 
Conference Her~ Today 

UC President Saxon, here for 
a meeting of the statewide 
AcademiC Assembly, will hold 
a press conference this morning 
at 9:30 and is expected to 
address the UCSD admini· 
strative confilct. 

There is no specified topic of 
discussion for the meeting, but 
the endangered job of 
William McElroy as chancellor 
is expected to draw all the 
questions from the press . 

The conference is scheduled 
for the Academic Senate 
conference room, nex~ to the 
coUege financial aids offices in 
the administrative c9mplex. 

As a part of the meeting 
Saxon is attending, the 

Academic Assembly, compo· 

UC President David Saxon 
sed of representatives from each 
of the nine UC campuses, will be 
voting on a proposal which calls 
for review of the chancellor on 
each campus every four years.

when they destroy th machin s 
they ar taking away the 
I gitimacy of the boycott. 

The boycotts were sparked 
by Chancellor William 
Mc Elroy's decision last sllmm r 
to transfer vending machine 
revenues from the college 
governments to the Housing 
and Food Administration . 
McElroy said his action was 
motivated by the need to 
alleviate a large HFS debt 
incurred by the Third College 
cafeteria . 

The first boycott took place 
from March 5·9 sponsored by 
the Progressive Coalition after a 
planned AS boycott fell 
through. 

The second AS sponsored 
boycott, mounted after the first 
AS failure , was in the se ond 
week of April. 

"We wanted to make it our 
first and foremost priority to let 
the students know what was 
happening and resolve what 
was going on ," ays Nan y 
Laga, AS vending machine 
task ferc coordinator. 

She cites the fact that 
McElroy announced hi 
decision after the boycott to 
re turn to the coli g $30,000 
in revenu whil appropriating 
the rest to the HFS deficit. 

His decision after his earlier 
proposal to offer the colleges 
$18,000 less. The announce.' 

ment was the third policy 
change on vending machines 
from McElroy's office in a year.

HFS, d c1ared in th wake of

action of the student body.

McElroy Drops Plan to 
'Use Hut for Faculty 

By Pat Domowitz 
Staff Writer 

The university administration 
has decided not to place a 
faculty club in the Coffee Hut, 
but is seeking clearance for the 
proposed club to be located in 
the International Center. 

In a letter written yesterday to 
The Friends of the International 
Center, the civic group which 
initially funded the center's 
construction, Chancellor 
William McElroy said, "The 
Coffee Hut was an early 
fa vorite , but a detailed 
inspection indicated that it 
would require extensive 
renovation and equipment 
replacement to be satisfac· 
tory .. . Thus the Board (of 
Directors, Faculty Club) has 
concluded that the only feasible 
possibility is to work out some 
mutually satisfactory arrange· 
ment with the International 
Center. If we cannot do this, I'm 
afraid there simply is no 
prospect in the foreseeable 
future for us to have a faculty 
dub ." 

As Vice President Nancy 

Laga aid the endorsement was 
not an official, Council·voted 
approval, but rather an 
"executive directive. ) 

" A few of the Council 
members endorsed the idea, just 
as any official may use his title 
in signing an editorial letter," 
she said . 

Laga said the AS "intends to 
maintain control of the (Coffee 
Hut) facility ," but has no 
"concrete" plans for its use . 

"Legally , on the books, the 
building belong to the AS. 
There,was a vote to close it, but 
it exists as ours," she said. 

Housing and Food Services 
said it was closing the Coffee 
Hut because of major deficits 
within its food ·serving function, 
although the Hut was the facility 
with the smallest deficit. 

The AS has actively lobbied 
against using the Hut as a 
faculty club, maintaining that 
the space is more properly the 
domain of the student .

McElroy's Future 
E ight hundred UCSD faculty members are voting this week on a resolution of "no confidence" in 

Chancellor McElroy, a vote that is, as far as we 
can tell, the first of its kind in the history of the 

University of California. The UCSD Academic Senate 
action comes in the wake of a 231 -116 vote· against 
McElroy May 29; the second ballot is being taken in the 
hope that more faculty members will participate. 

Whatever the vote's outcome, McElroy knows that 
almost a third of his professors want him out, despite his 
offer to rehire Vice Chancellor Paul Saltman and his 
decision to temporarily rescind the unilateral 
administrative shuffle that sparked the controversy. 

At its heart, the current crisis is not over ,tudent issues. 
Professors have their own interests, and' we presume they 
are voting them. We cannot begin to fathom the personal, 
political and emotional ties that link McElroy and 
Salbnan to their colleagues on the faculty. . 

But we do know that a similar attitude toward students 
by McFJroy - a tendency to act first, consult later - has 
led to similar clashes over vending machine income, the 
CoHee Hut and the daycare center and its fired (and 
subsequently rehired) director. We are reasonably 
certain that if students could vote no confidence in 
McElroy, many would eagerly do so. 

McElroy's current problem is with the faculty, which, 
so far, has not oHiciaily specified the pattern of neglect of 
which it accuses the Chancellor. But the vote is taken 
seriously by UC President Saxon and his associates, and 
McElroy should take it seriously, too. 

Yet we believe McElroy should resign, or be removed 
by the Regents, only if the faculty votes overwhelmingly 
against him in the current mail ballot. Much of his job, 
apart from the organization of the administration, is 
involved with grants and community relations; most 
direct contact between the faculty and administration is . 
through Sallman and his subordinates. Indeed, that'is 
what the SQuabble is about. We don't believe a close 
vote, say 55 percent to 45 percent against McElroy, 
would cripple his effectiveness. 

As they vole, professors should abandon the 
"emotionalism" that Academic Senate Chairman 
Russell Doolittle said characterized the first senate ballot. 
They must decide whether a vote against McElroy will 
mean a loss of funds or prestige for UCSD. On the other 
hand, they must honestly consider whether they believe 
McElroy will change his style of running things to include 
the increased faculty consultation they apparently feel is 
so important, and whether they trust the substance as 
well as form of his decisions_ 

Regardless of the vote, McElroy's position will be 
weakened in the few years he has Ieh here before 
retirement. He has played his hand ag~inst 
administrative rival Saltman and lost. 

Rec Center: Vote Yes 
S tudents have a chance today and tomorrow to decide whether they 'want to add $5 a quarter to 

their student activity fee to pay for a $1 miltion 
recreation center _ 'I'he new facilities, scaled down from 
an elaborate plan rejected by students two years ago, wiD 
include a new swimming pool with jacuzzi, a jacuzzi at 
the existing pool, raquetbaU courts and night lighting on 
the Muir field. 

We -recommetxi a yes vote on the referendum. The 
need for the facilities is clear, and the COlt is minimal. 
Raquetball players need only compare the additional fee 
to the bourIy rate at their favorite commercial court. And 
it is dear such a center will never be constructed unless 
.tudentaclecide to foot the bill directly themaelves. Given 
the effects 01 inflation on buildill8 COlli, there i. no better 
time than now for studenta ·w make that commitment.

Letters to the Editor 

Reg Fees Should Fund Rec Center 
Editor: 

The opponents of the 
proposed recreation facility are 
wrong. So are the supporters. 

Additional recreation 
facilities are definitdy needed 
here.·However, there is a proper 
and long established mech-
anism for funding such facilities 
without assessing ourselves 
additional fees . 

First, the opponents. Their 
argument seems centered on the 
need for additional on-campus 
housing. Apparently they are 
unaware of the large 
construction projects on Third 
and Warren. When these 
housing units become available 
in the fall, the demonstrated 

_ need for undergraduate housing 
will be met and space currently 
occupied by undergraduates in 
the Mesa Apartments will open 

. up for graduate students. 

Thus ther~ is no substantial 
argument against the proposed 
facility. The plans are student-
oriented and responsive to the 
criticisms expressed in the 
overwhelming rejection of the 
"country club" proposed two 
years ago. The need has been 
made clear by the students 
supporting the recreation 
facilities proposal. A separate 
fee, however, is an unnecessary 
burden on student finances . 
One of the stated purposes of 

the quarterly $125 registration 
fee is to provide "capital 
improvements which provide 
extracurricular benefits for 
students." That is, we are 
already paying for recreation 
facilities. We don't have them 
because the student affairs 
administration and the 
registration fee committee have 
consistently squandered 
hundreds of thousands of 
dollars annuaJly on marginal 
social services instead of 
providing for the real needs of 
the students. 

The facts are obvious. The 
registration fee budget allocates 
more to Counseling and 
Psychological Services (used by 
20 percent of the students) than 

to recreational athletics (used 
, by 67 percent of the students). 

Although used by nearly as 
many students (16 percent) 
intercollegiate athletics receives 
only half as much money as 
counseling. 

In the total $3.7 million 
registration fee budget, only the 
most prudent realignment of 
priorities would be necessary to 
free up the $150,000 annual 
cost of the proposed recreation 
facility. 

Therefore, I urge you to vote 
both yes and no on the 
recreation facilities question. 
Mark "yes" (for the facilities) , 
"no" (on a separate fee), and 
write in "use registration fees" 
on the ballot.

,------ Cites Guardian Tenure Coverage 

Reader Can See Through 'Piddle' 
By Lou Ney 

T 'hil year hal brought an interesting change for ·!he Guardian. I say thil more out of deductive reasoning than 
actual documentation. In the past few 

yt:arl the paper has been a self-serving, pro· 
administration, anti-reactionary, fascist piece 

. of piddle (yes, I say piddle), or so I was told by 
my altruiltic, anti-administration, 
reactionary, communist friends. I myself was 
never moved to take notice. 

However, this year the paper has been 
balicaUy a self-serving, pro-administration, 
anti-reactionary, fascist piece of piddle, but I 
at lealt have been moved to take notice. And 
there seem to be a few .timmerl ol hope. 

But before that, let me continue with the 
piddle. For instance, I'm sure that the rest 01 
the student body wal as fascinated 81 I wu to 
learn about "Saltman, the Existential Surfer." 
My immediate reaction was one 01 utter joy al 
I spread several copies 01 the article outon !he 
table .. xl to me al the Revelle Deli, (living the 

birds a target other than myself for which to 
aim. ,-

After all, I figured like would aUract like. 0/ 
course, that was by no means the only article 
this year fit for sllch a purpose, but was, in my 
humble opinion, by far the most worthy. 
Ah, but what of the glimmers I mentioned? 

"Do not despair even over the fact 
that you do not despair." -Kafka 

This quote may have little or nothing to do 
with this letter but I 6gured getting Kafka into 
The Guardian twice in the span of a week 
was worth it. 

What really has inspired this letter is the 
recent special report on tenure by Katherine 
Hafner and, perhaps, a secondary desire to 
take one Iasl parting.shot at Paul Saltman. 

Tenure, in my mind, is one of the few and 
Pfl!hays the only real issue there has been at 
UCSD that profoundly affects UI aU (daycare, 
Coors beer and, of course, the vital coffee hut

USSR, PRe Reconciling? 

MOSCOW (AP) - As the U.S.·Soviet summit 
nears, the Soviet Union and China, the two rival 
powers of the communist world , warily 'approached 
each other yesterday with the idea of warming their 
long-chilly rt:lations. 

The Soviets said they were ready to begin talks with 
China this summer "aimed at reducing tensions" that 
have kept the two countries feuding for two decades. 
Indications from Peking were that the Chinese 
regarded the idea favorably . 

The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Peking said the 
Kremlin proposal , made Monday by Foreign Minister 
Andrei A. Gromyko in a memorandum to the Chinese 
Embassy here, was "under study." 

But Foreign Minister Huang Hua told visiting 
Australian Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock in

according to an unidentified Australian source.

government to respect religious freedom, the full ra nge

If it does so, the pope said, there can be an 
"authentic dialogue" between church a nd state, even 
though the beliefs are "diametically opposed ' to 
Marxism's view of the world. 

The pop's speech put the gov rnment on notice that 
the Poli sh church will continue to press for respect for 
" the cause of fundamental huma n rights, including 
religious liberty." 
It was the fourth day of the former Cardinal Karol

judge told the Federal Aviation Administration to 
ground all U.S.-registered OC-IO jetliners yesterday, 
but the FAA said it would keep the planes flying 
pending a new hearing. . 

Government attorneys asked the U.S. Court of 
Appeals to prevent the grounding order from taking 
effect until the court can hear an appeal. Royc-e 
Lamberth, chief of the U.S. attomey 's office civil 
division , said he is asking for a stay "so we don't have 
to issue a grounding order tonight." 

U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson, Jr. also

Wednesday. If his order remains in effect, it would

Grad School Decision Requires Time 
By Heatherbell Fong 

Staff Writer 
The end of the school year is 

upon us, and many UCSD 
student, are 'pondering the 
choice of continuing their 
studies in graduate school or 
heading directly for the job 
market. 

Jean Fort, assistant dean of 
graduate siudies, warns the 
undergraduate student not to 

,rush into anything. 
"Time and again we find 

students going on to graduate 
school merely because they 
have nothing better to do," she 
NY.. "Then, once admitted, 
they discover it requires a large 
amount of dedication and 
commitment." 

Fort. however. is not trying to 
discourage students from 
continuing their studies at the 
graduate level. .. If you love your 
major and can't imagine doing 
anything else you should by all 
means continue into graduate 
studies," she said. Fort 
emphasizes the need ' for 
students to find out as soon as 
possible what they are letting 
themselves in for. 

Twice a year UCSO's Career 
Planning a nd Placement 
Services offers general 
information sessions on 
graduale schools where 

5tud~ts get advice on selecting 
a graduate program, gaining

graduates from staying on, Eventua lly I do plan to get my 
saying that they would benefit Master's, if not to broaden my 

working base, then to enhance 
my promotional possibilities." 

A slump in demand for 
coUege educa!ed workers, and 
the narrowing of the economic 
gap between the highly 
educated and the high school 
educated are two factors 
influencing students to ask 
themselves the question , "Why 
not get a job now and work my 
way up in the corporation?" 
commented Fort. 

The Bureau of Labor 
Statistics "estimates that about 
one·fourth of the graduates 
coming out of American 
colleges between now and 1985 
will have to settle for jobs tha t 
19 percent in the number of 
education," according to an 
article in The Chronicle of 
Higher Education. 

The same article quotes a 
U S Office of Education study 
on how the labor market affects 
coUege enrollment. "The spread 
between the earnings of college· 
educated workers and those of 
workers with only a high school 
education has continued to 
narrow, and the increase in 
demand for labor in the years 
ahead will be a t less highly 
ski ll ed , non . professional 
levels." 

In addition. the declining 

trend of the population will 
account for a nationwide drop of 
19 percent in the numbers of 
18·year·olds in the next 
decade. Although many older 
students are being attracted to 
go back to school, there is some 
disagreement among ex~.rt 
demographers whether there 
will be enough of them to fill the 
gap left by the decreasing 
numbers of younger graduates. 

In the fall of 1978, the age 
distribution of UCSD gradua{e 
students was as follow.: 21 yr. 
and under, 47 students; 22 yrl, 
150 students; 23 yrs, 237

that there was also an increase 
during March and a decrease in 
April , the trend is not nearly as 
striking as this year's figures . 

In March, 1978, commissions 
amounted to $5569.69. in 
March 1979, $6999.03 . 

In April 1978, commissions 
amounted to $4 ,228.50, in

And Other Chronic Diseases 

Selenium Dose May Keep Cancer Away 
By Dail St. Claire Bacon 

Staff Writer 
Selenium, a trace eleme nt 

found in many common foods , 
can prevent or retard a number 
of chronic diseases including 
cancer, according to UCSD 
chemist Dr. Gerhard Shrauzer. 

Shrauzer, since beginning 
experimentation ten years ago, 
has been the frontrunner in 
selenium research. One 
experiment used mice specially 
bred to develop cancerous 
tumors, and fed them selenium 
in their drinking water. Instead 
of the usual cancer incident of 
80·100 percent, only 10 
percent of the mice developed 
tumors. 

Selenium is an essential 

cofac tor 01 an enzyme that 
protects the cell membrane 
against disease. "You need 
selenium to stimulate a ll the 
avai lable physiological defense 
mechanisms agai n s t ar· 

cino.fCenicstress," said Shrauzer. 
Selenium is a trace element 

found in food , but originating in 
the soil. Its concentration varies 
with geographi c location . 
Consequently, people living in 
regions with large amounts of 
selenium in the soil receive 
higher concentration in their 
diets, 

Shrauzer said there is a direct 
correlation between selenium 
levels i!, the body and inci~ence 
of cancer. Death rates for 
leukemia, and cancer of the 

Today and Tomorrow 

lung, breast, ovary a nd rectum 
are significantly lower in 
Venezuela , where there is a 
higher conce ntr a tion 01 
selenium in the soil than in the 
US. 

Analyzing statistics on breast 
cancer from 17 countries, 
Shrauzer discovered that as 
leve ls 01 selenium in the blood 
increase, the number of breast 
cancer deaths decrease. 

Depending on location and 
the type of food consumed, the 
average American injests 90 to 
150 micrograms of selenium 
daily. Shrauzer said people 
need about 350 to 400 
micrograms daily to maintain 
good health. He recommends 
that people could increase their 

selenium intake throu gh 
supplements or ea ting seleniwn 
rich foods such as bread, whole 
gra in cereals and seafoods, 

There are drawbacks, 
however , to ea ting selenium· 
rich foods . "You would have to 
eat a lot of bread and other 
relatively high caloric foods to 
get enough selenium. People 
today don't move around 
enough to burn all those 
calories," Shrauzer said. 
Instead , he recommends 
anywhere from "ISO to 250 
micrograms of supplemental 
selenium a day." 

Shrauzer also recommends 
that such supplementation start 
at infancy. However, he adds, 
"it's never too late to start." 

Rec Center Election Scheduled 
By Pat Dofnowitz 

Staff Writer 
Students will decide today 

,and tomorrow whether to 
increase fees by $5 per quarter 
in order to construct, maintain 
and operate new rec reation 
facilities on campus. 

The two·day refere ndum will 
determine whether UCSD will 
install a ne w swimming pool 
with jacuzzi, a jac uzzi in the 
existing Natatorium , racquet · 
ball courts and night lighting on 

.. Muir field. 
Construction cost for the 

proposed facilities is estimated 

at $1,006,000, to be provided 
by a Regent's loan, repayable 
over 25 years at 9.5 percent 
interest. 

The $5 fee would pay 
$106,595 in loan payments 
each year and an estimated 
$43,405 for maintenance and 
operation, according to 
literature prepared by the 
facilities committee. 

Those tolal income figures 
were based on a student 
enrollment of 10,000 , Additional 
income could com from non· 
student user fees and renl when 
the school is not in session. 

Registered students would not 
pay any additional fees for use 
of the facilities . 

According '0 the committee, 
no lees would be collected until 
the lacilities are ready for use , 
which is expected to be in fall 
1981. 

The new pool would be 25 
yards by 25 meters , with a 15· 
foot diameter jacuzzi . The 
Natatorium jacuzzi would be 
the same size. The racquetball 
courts would be 20 feet by 40 
feet, with a locker room 
containing 100 dressing a nd 
500 storage lockers . Solar 

heating and natural ventilation 
are included in the designs. 

The new facilities would be 
run by a student committee, as 
are current recreation facilities . 

The referendum will be 
conducted by marshals 
repres nting both graduate and 
undergraduate students, with 
polling places located in the 
Revelle, Muir and Third plazas, 
the university and medical 
school bookstores a nd the 
Scripps In stitution of 
Oceanography snack bar.

DURING YOU'R SENIOR YEAR 
If you're a junior or senior with demonstrated ability in math and 
physics, you may be eligible. If you are selected for the Nuclear 
Propulsion Officer Candidate Program, the Navy will pay you over 
$650 a month for 12 months of your Senior year, Seniors qualify as 
soon as accepted. Atter graduation, and commissioning, you will 
receive graduate level training in Nuclear Power Plant Theory and 
Operation. 
Upon completion of Nuclear Power School, you will receive a $3000 
bonus and will be eligible for a $20.000 bonus after four years

Shrauzer's findings are being 
gradually accepted by the 
medical community. He noted 
that most people a re looking to 
cure callcer, not prevent it. 
"Everything takes iime," he 
continued, saying " Part of the 
problem is that people in the 
health business aren't educated 
in nutrition and don 't readily 
accept this" relation between 
selenium levels and cancer 
prevention.

Willy "Slay 'em" Shakespeare 

.. Bard Knew World of Locker Room 
By Henry J. DeVries 

Staff Writ. 
QWcky - name the bee 

gr_teat 'porttwriteri of all 
time. Now how many people 
said Grantland Rice, Red Smith 
and William Shakespeare? 

Shake.peare? Sports? 
The truth of the matter is that 
the Bard of Avon was into more 
than sonnets and plays. 

Evidence of Shakespeare's 
interest in .ports can be easily 
found in his works. Surely the 
line "My nearest and deare.t 
enemy" (King Henry IV, I) is a 
description of the local 
croutown rival. 

He was an avid football fan. 
u r ..... till the last ~asp" (King 
Hemy VI) and You base 
football .player" (King Lear) 
bear this out. His classic speech 
from King Lear, MThen kill, kill, 
kill, kill, kill, kill,!" is sliU used by 
many pro footban coaches 
today in the NFL. 

W1pleasant'st .words that ever 
blotted paper" (Merchant of 
Venice) or that they were "Done 
to death by slanderous 
tongues," (Much Ado About 
Nothing). 

Shakes~eare seemingly 
knows the Triton coaches well. 
Ex·Basketball Coach Barry 
Cunningham, like Hamlet, felt 
in many games that "All is not 
well, I doubt lOme foul." 

Sometime~ you have to 
translate from Elizabethian 

English to All· American slang. 
"Flat burglary as ever was 
committed". (Much Ado About 
Nothing) means 'we wuz 
robbed' and "A good mouth-
filling oath" (King Henry IV, I) 
comes out as "expletive 
deleted." It appears that 
referees have taken abuse for 
centuries. 

Shakespeare not only knows 
the UCSD coaches; he also 
knows the athletes. 
she be but little, she is 

Midsummer Night's Dream) is 
an apt description of the entire 
Women's Volleyball team. 
More than one Triton swimmer 
must have pondered "What 
pain it was to drown" (Richard 
III). 

The running craze at UCSD 
was predicted by the playwright 
when he wrote "The games 
afoot" (King Henry V) and 
advised everyone to "Jog on, 
. ,on" (The Winters Tale). PE 

Howard 

Hunt has been saying the same 
thing for years. 

The intramural scene here in 
La Jolla provides further 
indication that Shakespeare 
knew what was to happen. 
Many a losing team has 
declared that "All hell shall stir 
for this" (King Henry V), and it 
usually did stir Friday or 
Saturday night at a wild party at 
Muir. "They laugh that win" 
(Othello), but with enough beer 
the losers don't have such a bad 
time either. 

However , what could 
Shakespeare have meant when 
he said " I will make it felony to 
drink small beer" (King Henry 
V I, II)? Certainly if this is to 
become a crime, "The first thing 
we do, let's kill all the lawyers" 
(King Henry VI , II). Its the only 
way to make sure that sports at

"One man in Del Mar thinks

Charlie Daniels Has No Image 
To Project But Love of Music 

In 21 years on the road as a 
professional musician, Charlie 
Daniels has seen a lot - and 
has paid attention along with his 
dues . 

He 's played in honky lonks 
and at the White House, done 
session work behind other 
musicians from a variety of 
disciplines and recorded 12 
albums of his own since the 
1971 formation of the Charlie 
Daniels Band, albums that 
show a musical evolution more 
pronounced than many other 
Southern blues & boogie bands. 
And in a subtle way, Daniels 
has become the chronicler of the 
Southern music movement 
telling the story of its rise and 
decline and , on his latest album, 
paying homage to the genre's 
"martyr," Lynyrd Skynyrd's 
Ronnie Van Zant. 

But Daniels isn't just a rock 
and roller. At 42, he's made 
some astute observations about 
the workf surrounding him. In 
an interview Saturday, just 
before his performance at San 
Diego State's Amphitheater, 
Daniels ' Tennessee . North 
Carolina drawl filled a small 
room at the Town and Country 
Hotel. 

"I don 't have anything I want 
to say through this interview, 
except maybe to get across how 

much I love playing music ," the 
North Carolina lumberman's 
son said. 
. "I don't have some image I 

want to project. I'm just Charlie. 
I'd talk the same to you here as I 
would on horseback down on 
my farm . That way I don't have 
anything to live up to. I don't 
have to remember what person I 
have to be with each new person 
I meet - I'm always the ame 
person. 

"I guess that's' cause I don 't 
feel different than anyone - I'm 
no better or no worse than 
anyone else. I'm not intense -
I'm just laid back," he said. 
"Sometimes people in this 
(music) industry tend to put 
themselves on pedestals, you 
know: 'this is the way a star is 
supposed to act.' I guess a lot 01 
them saw Bob Dylan being hard 
to interview, and thought that's 
what made him famous. 

"But I'll tell you, Bob doesn't 
do that to create an image, he's 
just that way. Even when you 
know him {or a long time he 
doesn't talk a lot - he's shy and 
hard to interview because he's 
just that way." 

Daniels first met Dylan in 
1969 during the sessions for 
Nashville Skyline. Producer 
Bob Johnston called him in 
when the regular guitar player 

couldn't make it for one of the 
sessions - and Daniels wound 
up staying not only for the rest 
of the album, but two more, 
New Morning and Self· 
Portrait. 

The Dylan work gave 
Daniels a real push in Nashville, 
and soon he became known as a 
hot session man, for both guitar 
and fiddle, but in 1971 he felt 
the need . for some self· 
expression and formed COB. 

The first hit was "Uneasy 
Rider ," a humorous talking. 
blues account of hippie life in th~ 
redneck South. 

"Most of ' my lyrics have 
always told a story," Daniels 
said. "Some critics have called 
them too simple, but I think of 
tha : as a left·handed 
compliment . I want them to be 
simple; I want everybody to 
understand ." 

With his common-man 
touch , Daniels strong)y 
resembles Jimmy Carter, whom 
he calls "the best man to hokf 
the · office of the presidency in 
my lifetime. He's just folks, but 
he can't get things done ' cause 
it's a big fashion now in 
Congress to go against the 
President. Those ... those people 
are slowly destroying possibly 
the best man who's ever held 
that office. "

out the following facts pertaining to Friday night's disaster. 

" I. H .. 
1) Two out of four reels had not been rewound from the last showing 

of the film (they were shipped this way). . 
2) Th~l 9penif'1g credits ot the film were in CinemaScope. leading 

out ~Yojectionist to think he had a ·CinemaScope movie. when in 
fact he had a non·CinemaScope print. 

3) The trailer for the film ALIEN was placed on the film without our 
express permission. 

4) Reel number four of the five was not sent (although the 
duplicate reel number bne was labelled "Reel 4"). 

5) Refunds will be available at the Un;"ersity Box Office with 
pres~ntation of your ticket stUb . 

• 

I realize the large Inconvenience cause by the events Friday 
night and wish the whole situation could have been avoided 
We are currently confronting the tllm company involved, 
where the total blame to~ the Incident should be levelled. 

Again my sincere apologies,

Charlie Daniel., the chronicler of the Southern music 
~ovement, played at SDSU Saturday. 

Daniels ' opinion of Carter 
was formed long before the 
presidency while raising 
campaign money in benefit 
concerts before anyone knew 
the peanut farmer from Plains. 

"A lot of people jumped on 
his bandwagon after the 
nomination came through, but 
at first it was just us, Marshall 
Tucker, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The 
Allman Brothers - really 
mostly Gregg, the Outlaws and 
James Tally. We played for him 
before anyone knew who he 
was. 

"Mind you," he said, "on 
stage I don't run a political rally 

- I just play my music." 
However, he said, "If Mr. 

Carter needs me, I'll do 
whatever I can for him , 
whatever that happens to be." 

But when he's not discussing 
politics, either national or within 
the music industry, Daniels is 
eating, sleeping, breathing and 
thinking music . On the road to 
promote his newest album, 
Million Mile Renectiona. he 
admitted that long·time COB 
fans may find it a departure 
from previous fare. 

"It's not a departure for us-
we've been playing jazz and

No.ta/gia in Tuna Square 
- Charles Minflus (Columbia) 

I have no legitimate buainess writing thia piece, actually. Thi. 
reviewer i., to .be frank, 
praclicaDy a jazz illiterate. So I 
ask the well-versed jazz .tudent 
to evaluate my commenl. on 
Charles' Mingus newly-released 
NottalPa in Times Square 
two-dial( album with a little kind 
under.tanding. I'm j~at a 
sincere, well-meaning philistine 
who happens to love this Ip and 
is trying to ex prell why_ 

When I first put Noltalgia (a 
colection of 1959 Mingus 
studio sellionl) on my turntable 
I expected to be intimidated. As 
someone unfamiliar with the 
subtle ways of the jazz medium, 
I anticipated Mingus' music to 
be coldly intellectual stuff 
requiring musical sophistication 
to appreciate. By the middle of 
Side One I knew how wrong this 
assumption was - an I had to 
do was hear him to realize I was 
in the presence of a master. 

How to describe this 
experience is harder for me than 
the simple enjoyment of the 
music . I can't critique lyrics or 
even dwell upon melodies -
Mingus' jazz demands more 

'Zenda:' Sellers Own Co-star 
is not one of Sellers' best movies 
- it offers mild amusement as 
opposed to A Shot in the 
Dark's hilarious entertainment. 

Michael off . 
By choosing a comic 

approach to the story, director 
Richard Quine avoids 
comparison to the 1932 classic 
dramatic adaptation which 
starred Ronald Colman in the 
dual role. Quine directs 
smoothly but the pace is too 
leisurely for a comedy and the 
jokes are spread too thinly. 

Sellers as the lisping Prince 
Rudolf and the cockney· 
accented cabbie delivers two 
funny performahces. His 

than that. It isn't the tunes 
themselves that are so rich and 
entrancing, but how the 
individual players, as a team 
and in solo sports, rearrange, 
embellish and transionn them. 
Most of all, Mingus and his 
sideman keep the music 
MOVING continuoualy, 
combining (in my head. at least) 
the gracefulnes. of ballet with 
the reckless speed of a roler 
derby . . 

The most striking thing 
amidst all this surging sound is 
the vivid individualism of each 
mUlician and inltrument. 
Saxophonists John Handy and 
Booker Ervin, for instance. get 
away with .hameless hamming 
(silly riffs, indulgenl squeals) 
during such numbers al 
" Birdcalls" without knocking 
the tune itself off-course. The 
reed and brass instruments on 
Nostalgia are especially given 
freedom of expression as they 
take on varying character roles . 
I can hear the homs take on the 
air of a prancing hooker during 
"Slop," a languid card sharp for 
"Pussy Cat Dues" and a 
rollicking rodeo clown in the 
midst of "Song with Orange." 
This is more than music - it's 
theatrics. 

If the artists who perform 
here are prone to thowing off, 
they also manage to do it with 
urbanity and discretion. I 
envision pianists Horance 
Parian and Roland Hanna as 
tuxedoed gentlemen who play 
their keyboards with . genteel 
nonchalance, a sly haH-unileon 
their lips. Even when Parlan 
horsel around during a song ~ke 
"Jelly Roll" he remains 
absolutely cool, an upper-crust 
type allowing himself a brief 
moment of giddiness that'l 
memorable and amusing 
because.of his diffident marmer. 

Mingus himself amazes me. 
Coming from a rock 'n' roU 
background, I'm uaed to the 
bass being a rather colorless, 
utilitarian instrument. But the 
acoustic jazz bass, more 
specificaUy Mingus' bass, is 
distinctive and full of 
personality. Mingus' finger. 
p1uckings produce a fat but agile 
melody line. ponderous in its 
movement yet almost delicate. 
Together with Dannie 
Richman 's drumwork Mingus 
proves to my rock· addled ears 
that a rhythm section can do 
more than merely keep the beat. 

Yes, I've decided I like this 
(Please tum to page 13) 

Peter Sellers has the distinct 
honor of being the only actor to 
consistently have himself as his 
own costar. In Dr. Strangelove 
he had three roles (one of which 
was an American President), in 
The Mouse that Roared he 
played two men and one 
woman, and in Underc:overs 
Heroea he portrayed six 
characters. Now, in The 
Prisoner of Zenda Sellers 
takes on the roles of a prince. his 
father the king, and a cabbie 
who happens to be the prince's 
look·alike. Prisoner of Zenda 

The Prisoner of Zenda is a 
comic adaptation of Anthony 
Hope's adventure classic. In the 
film, Sellers plays a cabbie 
whose remarkable similarity to 
Prince Rudolf forces him into 
the job of royal decoy. The plot 
abounds in mistaken identities, 
double, double crosses and 
court intrigue as the good guys 
try to get Prince Rudolf on the 
throne and keep evil Duke (Please tum to page 13) Peter Sellers gets the point in "The Prisoner of Zenda."

No 'Piddle' on Tenure 
(Continued rrom paRt' 2) 
delicate one - controversial enough to have ' 
many sides ~ emotional enough to cause a 
reporter to become biased towards or against 
one of these sides (re: the so·called writers at 
the new indicator - "Popular Pfofessors get 
tenure - 5a1tman vows it won't happen 
again"). 

An article such as this, that. informs the 
public and allows it to form a rational , 
objective opinion is a far more effective way of 
dealing with an issue than say 500 screaming 
indignant radicals "demanding tenure" (or the 
coffee hut, whichever comes first). 

The Guardian (and in particular. 

Hafner's article was both excellently written 
and thoroughly researched. From 5altman's 
"subtle schmuule" to the concerns of the 
junior faculty with regards tQ the secrecy and 
potential politics involved in the process, all 
points of view were handled fairly and as 
completely as possible for an article· sized 
report. The comparison to other ' tenure 
processes and the additional article on 
alternative systems to tenure served to give a 
perspe tive on the iss'ue that I and I'm sure 
most other students did not have before. 

Katherine Hafner , who I noticed also wrote 
the excellent article which foreshadowed this 
one, on the Edelman tenure issue) should be 
commended. With a lillie effort ane a few 
more good staff writers, the glimmer of hope 
may give birth to something that could 
actually cause some real changes a t UCSD. 

As for my parting shot, I would jlJst like to 
quote our favorite vioe chancellor: 'If it looks 
like a duck , and it walki like a duck, and it 
talks like a duck - then it 's a duck ... ormaybe 
it's a pheasant with a haircut. " You said it, 
Paul.

material like this backstage for 
years. The band is constantly 
evolving - we love what we're 
doin', we're involved all the 
time. We keep that heart 
movement going, keep exoted 
about it. If we weren't we'd have 
to quit. 

"You know, if I could, I'd 
play to every man, woman and 
child on this planet at one time." 
Daniels said. 

"When the lights go down 
and they start playin' Tennessee 
Waltz - roy theme song -

West may lead to a lawsuit 
invol~ing these gro ups , 
accordmg to informed sources. 

These sources indicate that 
the Kuebelbeck group was 
chosen because it handles legal 
problems and deals with the 
strengths and weaknesses of 
land use cases. 

"Williams-Kuebelbeck serve 
as expert witnesses in Iand·use 
litigation," James Kuebelbeck 
said. "If a lawsuit were to result, 
the firm woukl testify at the 
direction of the City of Del 
Mar." 

Schwartz 
(Continued from page 10) 

The Co-op, which operates 
out of the Stratford Studio in Del 
Mar, is an attempt to give 
artists, playwrights , dancers 
and actors a place to gather and 
a f~cility to use. 

Though Schwartz says that 
he "can't manage the gloss" of 
Dd Mar he will stay ,in tha t

Nelson was cautious about 
the possibilities of litiga tion. 
" We c ho se Williams -

When we get the final data 
from the impact study, we will 
sit down with San Diego and 
hopefully they'll have answers 
and if not they'll get answers,': 
Nelson said .

Discrimination Would Be IlleglIL 

Vote Nears on Student Housing Bill 
By AlilOn Hall 
Staff Writer 

Finding off-campus housing 
may be somewhat easier for 
• tildents this faU if a bill before 
the Slate Senate this week 
passes. 

conservative than last year's, 
and with what he calls 
"probably the most powerful 
interest group .in Sacramento" 
fighting against the bill, the UC 
Lobby would have to work hard 
to sway the votes. 

Tennyson, his press aide says 
" the bill is too broad, but Craven 
could support one that pertains 
to certain kinds of apartment 
buildings ... there should be some 
exemption for small apartments 
and duplexes." Also, Tennyson 
says the term "students" is not 
defined. It could be construed, 
he argues, that anyone taking a 
course could be a student. 

for us." She cited the Genesee 
condominium complex which 
requires each student in the 
complex earn three times the 
rent he pays per month . 

Hewitt says tha t if the bill gets 
through the Senate a nd the 
Assembly, it could be enacted 
by the end of this summer. 

The main effeci of the bill, 
Hewitt adds, "would be to slop 
blankel discriminalion . If a ny 
landlord wishes nol 10 rent 10 a 
stud nl , though. Ihere a re ways 
10 ci rcllmvent the bill." Hewi tt 
adds tha t the risk of penalty or 
the act of being taken to court 
would dissuade most landlords 
from going around the bill. 

The bill, AB 224, up for its 
third reading before the Senate, 
amends the Rumford Fair 
Housing Act to outlaw 
discrimination against students 
in connection with the sale or 
rental of housing, or rental of 
housing solely because the 
prospective tenant is a student. 

Two hundred fifty le tters 
from UCSD students and the 
Lobby were sent to opposing 
assemblymen March 19 , which 
Hewitt says helped get the bill 
through the Assembly and to 
the Senate floor. 

The bill sets fines for those 
landlords or sellers who violate 
the bill for up to three times the 
actual damages and no less 
than $500. Exempt from the 
bill's jurisdiction are housing for 
the elderly, public and private 
postsecondary institutions, and 
any portion of an owner-
occupied single family dwelling. 

Gloria Spencer of Off-Camp-
us Housing at UCSD ays that 
the "prospects are good for 
listings and options" for next 
year, and that the Summer 
Intern Canvassing Program, 
employed for the past five 
years, will probably turn up 
repeat landlords for students to 
rent from . 

Marathon Planned 
If passed by the Senate,the 

bill will go back to the Assembly 
to resolve the differences 
between the Assembly and 
Senate versions. 

Bret Hewitt, codirector of the 
UC Student Lobby in 
Sacramento, said there is a 
"pretty good chance" that the 
biD will get through the Senate. 
But with opposition from the 
Real E."tate Lobby there, the 
bill'. fate i. not clear. He says 
this year's Senate is more 

State Senator William 
Craven (R-San Diego), who 
represents UCSD students, 
voted agains the bill in the 
Senate Committee on Local 
Government. As John 

WE 

Spencer added thal her office 
does not list any landlords who 
refuse to rent to students. 
Spencer feels that if the bill is 
enacted, "there would be some 
impact on this area-there are 
still landlords who refuse to rent 
to students. It (the bill) will 
probably open up some housing 

"North Cily West Run-
around" is the name of a 
10,000 meter run this summer 
in Del Mar against develop-
ment. 

Organized by a group called 
the Coalition for Responsible 
Planning, and approved last 
week by the Del Mar City 
Council , it is hoped the 
marathon will raise public 
opinion and funds in protest 
against proposed housing in 
North City West.

which will result from having
