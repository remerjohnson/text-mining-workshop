The AS oucil demonstrated excellent skill at last Wed nesday's meeting by 
savi ng the AS $260 as they funded the Summer Bridge Reunion Dance through 
the use of the KSDT "Mobile DJ Unit." 

Summer Bridge representative Efred Duarte approached the Council With a 
request of$610 to cover the co t of their fifth-yeJr reunion dance, to be held at 
the Revelle Cafeteria, aturda)" February 11 , atS pm (open to the public). Rental 
of the cafeteria would cost $150, and hiring of the 9lX mobile DJ unit tota led 
$460. Summer Bridge would prOVide the food , OASIS proVIded the mailing to 
the 400 Summer Bridge alumni , and SM would volunteer help. 

The AS Council showed mterest in the project but expressed that in 
comparison to other dances they had funded in the past, the request for $610 
was tOo hIgh. The Council suggested an altemallve of equal quality to meet the 
needs of Summer Bridge. KSDT has a mobile DJ unit, which provides music for 
$100. KSDTs unit does not include lighting as with the 91X un it. The Council 
proposed to cover the cost of renting the cafeteria, the KSDT mobile DJ unit, and 
$100 to rent lighting from the Universiry Events OlTice . Total COSt to the AS 
would be $350, thus saving $260 (approximately 43%). The Summer Bridge 
representatives accepted the suggestion , and the Counci l voted unanimously to 
fund the reunion dance. 

The Summer Bridge Reunion Dance will celebrate one of Early Outreac h's 

KSDT's mobile DJ ullit will be used at Summer BndRe's ReUll101l Dallcc. 

successful programs. The Summer Bridge progrJm IS J bndge [or students 
between high school ,md their first year at UCSD. As an Educational 
Opportunlry Programl Student Affirmative Action (EOPI M) student, one hJS il 
chilnce to get involved in universiry life bycoming to UCSDbefore others arrive 
and the f,lll quaner pressures begin. The Bridge is an intensive four-week 
program that includes sessions on writi ng uillversiry pilpers, math and science 
preparation for freshman courses and reading college-level matenals. Students 
learn skills thilt will help their study effiCiency manage their study Jnd 
recreation tlIne, and handle rheir course 10ild effectively. There are sports 
activities, field mps to local points of interest, <lnd a variery of social and 
recreational events each week. Also students have the opportunity to learn even 
more about the ul1iversiry through their resident peer counselor before school 
begins. The 400 participants in Summer Bridge over the past five years have 
developed J pride in rhemselves as students at UC D 

When the Summer Bridge alumni gather with the UC D commul1ity 
everyone WIll be dJncing to the sounds of the KSDT mobile DJ unit. Also known 
as the "Party Package," the KSDT fully professional OJ Ulllt provides twO 
turntables, mixer, an announcer microphone, amplifier, two speakers. twO DJ" 
and an all-e ncompassing range of record s, The DJs play from a program 
selected by the sponsoring organization , and / or audience request format. The 
KSDT unit's first use, since its Decemberund erwri ting, at the Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography Christmas Dance was well received. The money made by KSDT 
from the DJ unit will be paid to the AS Council ror the original underwriting. 

The AS Council is responsible for overseeing, coordinating, and runding 
more than 70 organizations here at UCSD. Some Council decisions over the last 
twO quarter have anracted strong critiCism from all sides, Their creative 
decision linking Summer Bridge and KSDT last Wednesday IS an indicator that 
they do have the abiliry to govern su cessfully.

KSDT is a st 
worthy of pro 

den resource 
erfunding 

KSDT, the student-operated CJmpu~ radIO station , 
IS not a moneymaking \'enrure , It Ius limltcd 
broadcasting apabili ties, and it plays an assornnem 
of music that is often c m-oCl zed , ye t It proVide - a 
learnmg npportun It)' tha t makes the -tanon valual-,le 
to CCSD and worthy of adequate fundmg 

It 1- nl new that finding d IJD I not Jhv, ed

More than 100 students each quarter take unpaid 
positions on the staff of KSDT. tudents spend 
between five and 20 (or more) hours a week domg 
specific jobs m one of the station 's eight di fferent 
departments. The depal1mems mclude ales and 
advertising, publi affairs, news and Sports 
broadcasting, and engmeering and programming. 
According to KSDT Program Director Karyn King, any 
student can become involved with the station . 
Pal1icipation is not limited to communications 
students or those interested in broadcasting as a 
career. 

KSOT also maintain!' a good relationshIp wlth the 
ro fessional broadcasting commun ity and the music 

industry. King says that this, tOgether with the 
exp~ rien e workmg at KSDT provides, has helped 
man tudents go on t paymg johs

ha ! \ordmg to Kmg, the budget ~IV(, to KSDT 
alwdys falls 'hort of what IS needed t..1 keep thl> 
station going. When thl - happens the station falls 
back on a va ri et), of fundralsmg measures such as 
bake sales, T-shirt sales, selling advertiSing, and 
pleading for more funds. While the station has 
always managed to pull through , King says it IS 
difficult to continue operati ng with the uncertainty of 
whether or nor the money will lasr. 

Because KSOT provides a training ground for many 
students enablmg them to gain job experience 
without leaving campus, we feel the station is an 
impol1ant resource for UCSD studems and deserves 
adequate funding.

"You have to put that bit more IntO It , over and

In seeking to educate the audIence. KSDT has 
stepped out of the traditional bounds of commercial 
radio. Playmg some of the esnmated 95% of the new 
music coming out neglected by pop stations has been 
one method. Allowing disc jockeys free reIgn wlthm a

Today is my birthday. Who cares? As my first bmhday aWdY from home, it 
sure makes me feel isolated from evel)'one around me . I hdve met many fun 
and Imeres[lng people here at UCSD. But friendships take time to develop , 
and only friends and family know when it is your birthday I went to the 
mailbox to check for birthday cards. There was only a bIll and your Chnstmas 
card. Great mall service here Now I can cancel me loneliness I felt at 
Christmas. 

When [ went 10 pay the bill the clerk gave me a hard mne. I asked him to 
t.1ke it easy: "After all , today IS my bmhday " He said. "Really, prove It to me. 
Let me see your dnver's license ." 

I had classes all day. I remember when you let me stay home from school 
on my btrthday because you sdid It was my day to feel speCial and unique. 
Around here we are told the only special people .lre famous professors and 
infamous grad students. 

The bst class got OUt af,er dark As , w'llked acras the quad I remembered 
there wa~ a Revelle tradition of dunking the btrthday person In the pond I 
used to think It was childish and dumb, now I envy them. I deCIded to get 
out of my funk by jumping In the pond It was empty I That really got me mad 
so I shouted , "Hey. It'S my bIrthday." Someone shouted b,lck, "So what Who 
do you thmk you are, the center of the universe?'" 

Running back to my donn room , I went to the bathroom mirror just to see 
the face of someone who knew me well enough to know It was my birthday. 
Then I started wondet ing, how well do I know myself? Why do [ feel so lonely 
,md msecure without my family and friends from back home? [ thought gOIng 

Letter 
Home 

to college was supposed to give students a Teeling of Independence. But how 
do )'OU get it? They don't give classes m mdependence , or for that matter 
anylhing else that helps you to mature. 

As I sit here feeling more ,md more isolated from people, my body seems to 
be getting smaller and I feel more childhke. The SIghts and sounds around me 
amplify every second of this eternally long day. My philosophy teacher talks 
about zen meditation being an experiencing of the infinite now. I guess I 
must be meditating. 

Why does today have to seem so long? I could really use a long day some 
other time when I have to study for an exam. or when I need to take a day ofT 
and get away from the studies. Maybe I should treat other days as if they were 
my bIrthday. Perhaps they are but I don't know myself well enough yet to 
realize it. Did I say that? I thought only older people had thoughts like mat. 
But then again , I am older, today. 

I just had a creepy thoughr. What if this were my last birthday? [ remember 
in the movie Bladerunner the android Roy had only four birthdays. He wanted 
to know, "Who am l? Why am I here? How long have I got?" 1 only ask myself 
these quest ions when I am lonely. Are birthdays the time when we tl)' to 
answer these questions? Is this why some birthdays feel full and eXCi ting, and 
some feel empty and lonely? 

It's midnight. My loneliness has faded now that today will be just another 
day, or will it? [ think I will go to the Revelle quad at lunch, look for a lonely 
face , and say Happy Birthday. 

Till next week, 
Chris

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVAGE 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Oh please! You don 't have to questIon now! 
Enemy black was everywhere. Monk for a catch - Hayes IS there . C harlie Brown [urns 
- Haynes bats it away. Theismann loops a pass ... interception .. capitalizatton ... 
touchdown RaIders. From the starr . Riggins and the pile never moved. They got stuck 
in the mud . Theismann tried 10 pass bu! a black blanket draped ~he Smur[s. Whl'n 
Plunkett looked downfield , Branch flashed like a Japanese bomber. It was bombs-away 
on the Redskin Pearl Harbor secondary. End of the fourth quarrer - the pnde is 
already poised - and Marcus Allen takes the handoff. Pat Summerall takes over: 
"Marcus reverses. Gets a block. And another one . Marcus is on the loose. Can he go 
the distance? Yes." I he baby is in bed before the babYSitter .Irnves. The Marcus 
touchdown set a record for the longest run in Super Bowl history. The questton was 
never in doubt. It was quiCk. Flores was hoisted up off his feet at the half. The 
champagne corks were popping in the thIrd quarter and AI Davis was reh '!arsing hIS 
acceptance speech with ten mmutes to go. I had no idea Theismann would be .IS 
flustered as he was. The Raider secondary is good but this Redskin offense tsn 't even 
close to the best. Who is Clinr Didier anyway? Welcome to the Los Angeles winner 
circle , O.lkland . Excuse me now - I've ,l.!,Ot 10 fini sh my ham sandwich . 
NOT TO BE BEUEVED DEPT. As I watched the Los Angeles Kings-Edmonton Oilers 
hockey game on television Friday night Cactually, I turned down the sound and 
listened to the Clipper game to see if Terry Cummings would play) it suddenly struck 
me that this garbage is being passed off as one of the nation's four major sports. I 
looked on as Bernie Nicholls slipped the puck past the Oiler goalie for a 3.0 Kings 
lead and then Sighed as a fight broke out at center ice. I watched as the Great Gretzky 
scored on a breakaway in the second period to cut the Kings lead to 5-3 and the~ 
yawned as blows were exchanged behind the Kings' net. I stared in awe as Gretzky 
fired the puck past Kmgs' goalie Marco Baron to tie it at five and then left the room as 
sticks and leather went flying in the massive brawl that broke OUt on the ensuing face-
o ff. This hockey-boxing-wrestling spectacle Simply docs not belong on TV. I would 
rather see the station air reruns of Bat/Ie of the Network Stars. I cannot beheve that the 
NHL feels the players have to resort to a constant display of physical violence to draw 
fans. I must have been subjected to 15 melees during the "hockey" game. Sadly enough, 
this is typical. Channel 8 's Ted Leitner, with whom I rarely agree , chimes in with me 
on this issue. The extent of Leimer's hockey videotape is usually a few brawls and a 
goal. He does this for a purpose. He is disgusted with the game's shenalligans. The 
NHL IS so far gone on thIS scrap-crap that they even forced out a quality player for not 
fighting. Two years ago this month , while playing left wing for the Kings, Paul Mulvey 
refused an order from Coach Don Peny 10 leave the bench and join what became a 
bench -clearing brawl, Mulvey was sent to the minor leagues and then traded to 
Edmonton during the off-season. He was dropped to Edmonton's farm team, the 
MonCIOn Alpines, and released for good after last season. Mulvey was blackballed. The 
NHL must realize that it does nor need to employ the brutish hype that pseudo-sports 
like roller derby and big time wrestling slllvive on . Hockey should change its act to 
avoid a mutiny among its increaSingly apathetiC fans. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. Miami's upset of Nebraska m the Orange Bowl was a big 
one, but it wasn 't as stunning as the one the HUITIcanes pulled ofT in 1933, the first 
year of what later would be called the Orange Bowl. That year, it was called the Palm 
Festival , and Miami faced Manhanan , an Eastern power coached by Chick Meehan . It 
looked like a mismatch . Miami had been blanked three times that season - by 
Rollins, Murray Teachers and Middle Tennessee - and two nights before the game 
Meehan met with the Palm Festival committee and agreed to take it easy "after we 
score our first three tOchdowns." The game almost didn't come off. On the day of the 
game, the organizers were still $1 ,500 short of the guarantee they had promised 
Manhattan . Meehan threatened to take his team home, but just before kickoff. the Palm 
Festival finance director showed up with 15 $[00 bills. The game was on . As ([ turned 
out, Meehan didn't have to worrY about holding down the score. HIS team did it for 
him. Miami won 7-0. 
NEXT QUESTION PLEASE DEPT. Last week's question : What did the five different 
color circles stand for in the 1980 Winter OlympiCS? Answer: The rings, or circles, thaI 
form the Olympic symbol originally represented the five major continents: Europe, 
Asia , Africa, Australia and America (both North and South). The cOl1cept now is that 
the rings are linked together to denote the sporting friendship of the peoples of the 
earth. The colors - blue , yellow, black, green and red - were chosen because at least 
one of them appeared in the flag of every nation on earrh Today's question: If a major 
league baseball player has hit safely in , say 25 straight games and is appearing as a 
pinch hitter and gets hIt by the pitch, does his streak continue? Does it continue if he 
draws a walk? Sacrifice bums? Sacrifice nics? Answer in Thursd, y's issue .

The toughest job 
you'll ever love 

We admit it. It takes a dif-
ferent kind of person to be a Peace 
Corps volunteer. 

We won't mislead you with 
glowing pictures of exotic land. The 
hours as a volunteer are long. The 
pay is modest. And the frustrations 
sometimes seem overwhelming. But 
the satisfaction and reward are im-
mense. You'll be immer ed in a new 
culture, become fluent in a new 
language, and learn far more about 
the third world - and yourself -
than you ever expected. 

You'll a lso discover that prog-
ress brought about by Peace Corps 
volunteers is visible and measurable: 
Such as health clinics e tablished in 
the P hilippines; Fresh-water fish 
ponds constructed in Kenya; roads 
and schools and irrigation systems 
built in Upper Volta; tens of thou-
sands of people given essential skills 
in farming, nutrition, the skilled 

trade, business, forestry, and other 
speciallies throughout the develop-
ing world . 

Being a volunteer isn't for 
everyone, and it isn't easy, but to the 
people of the developing nations 
who have never before had basic 
healt h care or enough to eat, the 
Peace Corps brings a message of 
hope and change. 

We invite you to look into the 
volunteer opportunities beginning in 
the next 3-12 months in Africa, 
Asia, Latin America, and the Pa-
cific. Our representatives will be 
pleased to provide you with details.
