CalPIRG Surveys Candidates 
ELECTION: Three out of four candidates say they oppose offshore drilling 

The UCSD chapter of the 
California Public Interest 
Reaearch Group held a press 
conference Tuesday to publicize 
the presidential candidates' 
positions on offshore drilling 
on California's coast. 

Lauren Yamane, Marshall 
freshman and co-coordinator of 

the~veOurC~tCampai~ 
said that C.aIP!RG surveyed the 
top four presidential candidates 
for their positiors on offshore 
drillina and fowld that every 
candidate ex«pt for Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush opposes new 
drilling. 

Yaman'! said that Vice 
President Al Gore has pledged 

to ban all new oil drilling off 
California's coast. 

"Gore has stated he would 
do everything in his power to 
make sure there is no new 
drilling off the coasts of 
California and Rorida, even in 
areas already leased for drillin§ 
by previous administrations,' 
Yamane said. 

Noah Greer, Muir junior 
and chapter chair of CaIPIRG, 
said Sen. John McCain also 
supports a ban on offshore 
drilling. 

"Sen. McCain told me that if 
the California people want a 
ban on all new drilling, he will 
allow the 36 unprotected leases 
to expire," Greer said. 

Yamane said that in a letter 
to CaIPIRG, tormer Sen. Bill 

Bradley stated that he would 
protect California's coast from 
all new drilling. 

"Bradley stated he will sup-
port and sign an executive 
order to give permanent protec-
tion for the entire Cafifornia 
coast, including the 36 leases," 
Yamane said. 

Yet in sharp contrast to the 
other candidates, Yamane said 
that Texas Gov. Bush has not 
pledged to protect the coast 
from ~ oil and gas drilling. 

"Bush has stated he would 
look at whether or not to allow 
drilling on the 36 leases on a case-
by-case basis," Yamane said 

IJan Bartlett, a spokesman 
for Bush, said that while Bush

TAs Vote 
to Approve 
Strike 
LABOR: UCLA and UC 
Davis overwhelmingly 
authorize walk -out 
., VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

Union-a ff ilia ted teaching 
assistants at UCLA and UC Davis 
voted overwhelmingly last week 
to authorize a strike. Voting will 
continue systemwide through 
next week. UCSD TA will begin 
voting March 6. 

At UCLA, members of the 
Student Association of Graduate 

Employees/Unit~ Auto Workers 
voted 808-95 to authorize a strike. 
At UC Davis, members of the 
Association of Graduate Student 
Employees voted 433-84 in autho-
rization of a strike. 

"These votes show clearly that 
academic student employees will 
not stand for (the University of 
California's] failure to respect its 
legal obligations to our union," 
said Kristen Guzman, UAW bar-
gaining team member and teach-
ing assistant at UCLA. 

In a Feb. 21 press release, the 
union said the University of 
California engaged in unlawful 
bargaining practiCes by making 
unilateral changes in working 
conditions that are the subject of 
bargaining, hand-picking indi-
viduals and student groups to 
bypass the elected bargaining 
team and by bargaining in bad 
faith. 

Brad Haywa{d, a spokesper-
son for the university, said last 
week that those claims are inaccu-
rate. 

A strike authorization vote 
does not necessarily mean that a

I CIENCE: Researchers discover that people can stiII accomplish complex tasks when sleep deprived 
., ......... 

St8ff~ 

After being deprived of sleep, 
the human brain attempts to com-
pensate for its lack of sleep as 
much as poesible, according to 
two studies conducted by UCSD 
psychiatry Profesaor J. Christian 
Gillin and a team of researchers 
from the UCSD School of 
Medicine and the Veterans Affairs 
Healthcare System in San ~. 

Researchers were surpnse<i to 
learn that the prefrontal cortex in 
the brain tends to be more active 
when the brain does not get 
enough sleep. 

The prefrontal cortex Is the 
are.! near the front of the brain 
that allows humans to conduct 

complex cognitive tasks. The 
prefiontal cortex is also what sets 
humans apart from other 
species. 

The temporal loDe, which is 
the region of the brain that is 
involved in language processing, 
was not active in sleep deprived 
subj«ts in the study. However, 
the parietal lobes tended to be 
more active in sleep deprived 
subk.'Cts. 

the parietal lobes perform 
somewhat different functions in 
the learning process. Although 
the subjects' memory perfor-
mance was less efficient, there 
was greater activity in the pari-
etal region, which is aSSOCIated 
with better memory. 

"It is possible that when the 

prefrontal and temporal regions 
were affected by sleepiness, the 
brain shifted the verbal process-
ing to another system in tne pari-
etallobes that could compensate 
for the loss of function," said 
associate psychiatry Professor 
Gregory Brown, a member of the 
team who conducted the study. 
"This suggests that parietal lobes 
might playa special role in the 
brain's compensation for sleepi-
ness." . 

Gillin and his team discov-
ered that although the brain is 
valiant in its efforts to fu.,ction 
when deprived of sleep, the abil-
ity for the brain to perform basic 
cognitive tasks, such as the 
memorization of words or sim-
ple arithmetic involving subtrac-

tion, are greatly diminished. The 
effects of sleep loss are also dif-
ferent depending on the specific 
cognitive task the brain is asked 
to perform. 

The researchers speculate that 
the deprivation of sleep disrupts 
certain electrical patterns and 
chemical activity that keep the 
brain from functioning normally. 

"It is important to remember 
that sleep deprivation does have 
detrimental effects, which we 
sometimes forget as we push 
workers, students and others to 
perform even when they are 
functioning with a lack of sleep," 
Gillin stated. 

Gillin said that sleep loss can

CaIPIRG: 
Next president will 
decide new drilling 
CoRtIn .............. 1 
supports a moratorium against 
new offshore drilling in 
California and Florida, he 
would not invalidate the cur-
rent leases across the board. 

"Gov. Bush doesn't believe it 
is prudent to make those leases 
invalid withoul looking at the 
law," he said. "Several politi-
cians have made those state-
ments without looking at the 
law. The Governor has a clear 
vision. No one knows better than 
a Governor, for he deals with off-
shore drilling constantly." 

Yamane said that the candi-
dates' poSitions on offshore 
drilling are crucial to the future 
of Cali1orrua's coastline. She said 
that 36 1eases in federal waters 
off the roast are currently unpro-
tected by moratoriums enacted 
by Presidents Bush and Clinton 
in 1990 and 1998, respectively. 

"The decision to allow new 
drilling Will'be made by the next 
president, between May and 
November of 2001," Yamane 
said. 

She said current drilling off 
the coast already dumps thou-
sands of tons of toxic metals and

"When you do pull an all-

fluids into coastal waters every 
year and creates a high risk of a 
major oil spill. 

Yamane said the people of 
California are strongly opposed 
to any new offshore drilling. 

"The state legislature has 
passed a bipartisan resolution 
urging the protection of these 
leases from new drilling." she 
said. "The California Coastal 
Commission, Gov. Gray Davis 
and Attorney General Bill 
Lockyer are suing the federal 
government because the leases 
were extended without the 
state's approval," Yamane said. 

Yamane added that the state 
is clearly in favor of banning 
new drilling. 

"CaIPIRG has gathered 
more than 20,000 signatures 
from California citizens who 
support a permanent ban on all 
new drilling:' she said. 
"California is sending a clear 
message to the next president: 
Save our coast from the dan-
gers of new drilling by extend-
ing the current ban to the 36 
unprotected federal lease." 

Yamane said CalPIRG com-
mends Gore, McCain and 
Bradley for pledging to protect 
California's coast, and urges 
Bush to show he will do the 
same by signing CaIPIRG's 
pledge to ban all new drilling 
off the coast. 

nighter, there is a big trade off," 
he said. lIyou may not be as effi-
cient or effective as you'd normal-
ly be. With these studies we now 
have evidence that the brain is 
not functioning as it should after 
sleep deprivation."

cation, for the operation of slot 
machines, lottery games, and 
banking and percentage card 
games on Indian lands. The mea-
sure prevents the shut-down of 
Ind ian gaming in California and 
promotes Indian self-reliance, 
allowing tribes to expand regulat-
ed gaming on their own tribal 
land to provide jobs and to fund 
education, housing and health 
care programs for both gaming 
and non-gaming tribes. 
According to state tribes, reserva-
tions with casinos have seen 
unemployment drop by nearly 50 
percent and welfare by 68 per-
cent. 

Opponents of the measure say 
that by allowing more casinos in 
the state, gaming addicts would 
have more opportunities to gam-
ble their lives away. Opponents 
also c1~im that it is wrong that 
the caSInos, many of which will 
be funded by Nevada casino 
interests, do not pay federal 
taxes . 

We feel that restricting Indian 
gaming is not a solution to the prob-
lem of gambling addictions. 
Furthermore, the measure would 
result in a net gain in state and local 
taxes by prOViding employment to 
California citizens. 

Native Americans have been 
deceived and mistreated in the 
pas t. They have been relocated to 
remote lands where many have 
been forced to support themselves 
through welfare. We support 
Proposition lA because we feel 
that Indian gaming is a positive 
step for the Native American com-
munity.

eo.t.I ProtectIon 110IIII Act 01 
2000 

Proposition 12 ..... 
will provide a 
bond issue of $2.1 
billion to protect 
California's water 
and air quality. It 
would ~ used to 
protect the envi-
ronment on ... ---_"" 
California's coasts, lakes and water-
ways. 

Proposition 12 will help protect 
California's vital water sources, 
assuring clean water supplies for 
drinking water and agriculture in 
the state. It will also provide pro-
grams for planting trees to bolster 
California's forests and help 
improve the quality of air. A small 
portion of the bond will also go 
toward creating community parks. 

The proposition has been 
designed to be economically sound. 
It provides for aMual audits and 
hearings to make sure that the 
money provided by the bond is 
being spent appropriately. The pas-
sage of the bond will not increase 
taxes because it has been designed to 
utilize existing tax revenue. 

Opponents of Proposition 12 con-
tend that the initiative has been con-
cocted to benefit environmentalist 
special interest groups and that the 
$,3.7 billion in premiums and interest 
on the bonds is too high for 
Califomia to pay. 

protection. The projected growth for 
the state of California means the 
growing population will put ever-
increasing demands on the state's 
resources. It is important to expand 
California's water infrastructure 
now to prevent any shortages in the 
future. 

The program will also safeguar(} 
California's water resources by pro-
tecting important sources of water 
from pollution and flood damage. 
Furthermore, it will promote respon-
sible water consumption through 
water conservation efforts and the 
construction of recycling plants. 

California has the largest popula 
tion in the United States and wil 
only continue to grow in coming 
years. Proposition 13 will ensure I 
that drinking water and water sup-
plies for California's vital agricultur-
al industry can meet the increasing 
demands that will result from this 
growth. 

Those opposed to Proposition 13" 
are concerned with California's grow-
ing reliance on bond issues. Interest 
on outstanding bonds currently 
accounts for $3 billion of California's 
$81 billion budget. Opponents also 
cite a 1996 bona of almost $1 billion 
for the purpose of ensuring water 
safety as evidence that any further 
projects are unnecessary.

These funds will not be spent 
on administrative costs and prior-
ity will be given to joint ventures 
between schools and libraries. 
Libraries and reading are an 
essential part of a child's educa-
tion. Although the Internet is rev-
olutionizing access to resources, 
no more than 50 percent of the 
population has Internet access. 
Libraries will remain essential to 
the education and pleasure of 
children, the elderly and others. 

Opponents argue that it is 
impractical to build additional 
libraries when currently existing 
libraries are not open when stu-
dents and working adults can use 
them. Moreover, some opponents 
believe that the Internet will 
make libraries obsolete in five 
years.

an urgent matter, forensic labora-

ject while projects financed from

Moreover, there are many pri-

sarne services that would be pro-
vided by these new or remodeled 
laboratories. Thus, it would be 
much more cost efficient to priva-
tize these functions and send 
forensic work to these labs. 
Another alternative to building 
new crime laboratories is to rent 
private space in already existing 
buildings. Clearly, there is no rea-
son to pass a bond measure and 
spend tax money for this pur-
pose. 

Proponents for the measure 
argue that these crime laborato-
ries are necessary for more effi-
cient and accurate analysis of 
crime evidence. They also claim 
that this will reduce the time it 
takes for a case to go to trial, 
thereby saving taxpayers' 
money.

Proposition 17 .... ----..... 
proposes an amendment to 
California's constitution that 
would change the state's ban on 
lotteries to allow non-profit orga-
nizations to conduct raffles for 
charitable purposes. 

Proposition 17 allows too 
many opportunities for abuse. 
There have been too many cases 
of con-artists passing themselves 
off as philanthropiSts without lot-
teries - this law would provide 
criminals with additional oppor-
tunities to scam citizens. 

There re enough existing 
means of lontributing to c.harities 
without modifying California's 
constitution. Legalizing charita-
ble lotteries does not seem to be 
an effective means of promoting 
contributions. 

Proponents of Proposition 17 
argue that many illegal raffles are 
already conducted in California, 
and often the operators are 
unaware that they are violating 
California Penal Code. 
Proponents view Proposition 17 
as a means of legalizing this 
harmless use of raffles and 
expanding the scope of legitimate 
fund-raising.

murders committed in connection 
with kidnappings or arson, or for 
murders committed "by means of" 
rather than "while" lying in wait. 

Imprisoning and executing 
more prisoners will not solve 
California's crime problem. 
Califomia needs to reduce, rather 
than increase, the legal costs and 
moral impact of capital punish-
ment. No one has been able to 
demonstrate that capital punish-
ment deters murders or saves lives. 

The cost of sending one prison-
er to death row is $2 million more 
than the cost of sending someone 
to prison for life. This money can 
and should be invested in educat-
ing our youth so they do not end 
up in prison. If PropoSition 18 
passes, it could cost the state $750 
million in additional legal costs. 

Supporters say the measure 
corrects discrepancies in our cur-
rent law. · They argue that 
Proposition 18 provides juries with 
the language to impose a death 
sentence or life imprisonment 
without parole upon kidnappers 
or arsonists with intentions of 
murder.

State University peace officers to 
life imprisonment without the 
possibility of parole. The current 
punishment for second-degree 
murder of such officers is 15 
years to life. The murder of most 
police officers in the state is 
already punishable by life 
imprisonment . 

This proposition merely makes 
California's protection of police 
officers consistent. UC police offi-
cers are currently protected by the 
life imprisonment sentence; it only 
makes sense that their CSU coun-
terparts should enjoy the same 
protection. BART officers also face 
considerable danger in their line of 
work and should be afforded the 
same protection. 

Opponents of Proposition 19 
are worried that the text of the 
amendment will be abused. They 
are afra id that it will allow offi-
cers to force ci tizens to join a 
posse or face fines. They are also 
concerned that it increases the 
penalty for making false reports 
to BART officers and would allow

6 OPINION 

PROPS: 
Campaign reform 
and school bonds 
Continued from ..... IS 

This proposition is a round-
about and uncertain method of 
addressing California's educa-
tion needs. In the event that 
lottery revenue does not 
increase dramatically, the pro-
posed amendment would have 
minimal fiscal impact on the 
state's education system. The 
California State Lottery itself is 
not the most efficient means of 
funding education . Only 34 
percent of the money collected 
by state lottery ticket sales 
goes to schools - 50 percent 
goes toward prizes and 16 per-
cent goes toward paying the 
administrative costs of the lot-
tery. 

This proposition is an ineffec-
tive solution to the shortcom-
ings of California's education 
system. The best way to guaran-
tee that public schools in 
California receives the text-
books and educational supplies 
that they require is to allocate 
part of the state budget or to 
Issue a bond toward purchasing 
these supplies. Proposition 14 
on this ballot is a prime example 
of an effective contribution to 
education in California; 
Proposition 20 is not. 

The proponents of 
Proposition 20 correctly warn of 
a textbook shortage in 
California, as well as the need for 
additional instructional aids. 
California is currently ranked 
47th out of the 50 states in text-
book spending per student. They 
project that the passa~e of 
Proposition 20 would prOVIde an 
additional $90 million for text-
books and educational materials 
for 2000-2001. 

21 - Juvenile CMIe 
Proposition 

21 would 
increase the 
punishment for 
many gang-
related crimes 
(including 
authorizing the death penalty _ _ __ -' 
for gang-related murder), require 
suspects who are 14 years or older 
to be tried as adults for certain 
crimes, require people convicted of 
gang-related offenses to register 
with the state and expand the 
number of crimes that are consid-
ered violent and serious felonies. 

Proposition 21 would put the 
option of trying juvenile defen-
dants of murder and certain sex 
felonies as adults in the hands of 
the prosecutor, who will of course 
be interested in seeking the maxi-
mum penalty. Consequently, pros-
ecutors will opt almost invariably 
to try such juveniles as adults. This 
would end the current practice 
that allows judges to practice 
restraint in cases with special cir-
cumstances, such as mental insta-
bility or family abuse. 

The passage of this proposition 
would incur one time costs of 
about $1 billion for additional pris-
ons and $750 million in legal costs 
n.ecessitated by the stricter provi-
SIOn, and would cost California an 
additional $300 million a year to 
pay for longer criminal sentences. 

The state prison system has a 
poor record of reforming inmates 
as it is - placing teenagers in state 
prisons instead of in juvenile facil-
ities that are better suited to their 
needs will not help prevent youth 
or gang-related crimes. It will 
merely take money away from 
other, more effective programs. 

Proponents of Proposition 21 
argue that current laws are too 
lenient and do not provide enough 
of a deterrent for crime in 
California. They insist that 

The UCSD Guardian 

Proposition 21 will fight the grow-
ing trend of juvenile crime. 
22 - Ullllt 011 ... ,.. 

Proposition 
22 would legis-
late that, "Only 
marriage 
between a man 
and a woman 
is valid or rec-
ognized in 
California." If ........ ___ ........ 
Proposition 22 passes, it will be 

• the thirty-first piece of legislation 
of its kind in the United States, a 
state-level version of the national 
Defense of Marriage Act. 

It must be understood, how-
ever, that neither a Yes or No vote 
on this proposition will actually 
change the current legality of 
same-sex marriage in California. 
Whether it passes or not, such 
marriages still will not be recog-
nized. This proposition is merefy 
a preventative measure by Peter 
Knight and his supporters to 
guard against the "full faith and 
credit clause" of the Constitution; 
in the case that another state does 
lift the ban on same-sex mar-
riage. 

Thus, this initiative says that 
even if same-sex marriage does 
become legal in another state, 
California does not have to recog-
nize marriages of couples in anoth-
er state. A vote of no on Proposition 
22 will stop California from becom-
ing yet another state to use democ-
racy to legislate hate and discrimi-
nation. 

Proposition 22 constructs same-
sex marriage as a major problem in 
California when in fact it does not 
cost citizens any money or deny 
them any rights or benefits. Same-
sex marriages are merely a person-
al issue and should not be regulat-
ed by t/le state government. 

Advocates of Proposition 22 
argue that marriage is an institu-
tion which has traditionally exist-

ed only between a man and a 
woman. They fear that other 
states may impose different belief 
systems and legal obligations on 
California should these states 
decide to pass laws recognizing 
same-sex marriages. They contest 
that Proposition 22 would not 
take away individuals' rights, 
but, rather, would defend the 
rights of heterosexual families.

This statute would not 
increase interest in elections 
because it does not offer any con-
structive option that California 
voters do not already enjoy -
voters can already abstain from 
voting for any office or write in 
any candidate's name. For 
decades, American voters have 
expressed their displeasure with 
the choice of candidates by writ-
ing in Mickey Mouse's name for 
the office. 

California's elections are not 
multiele-choice exams. We don't 
need 'None of the above," or "No 
confidence" or "All of the above" 
options on our ballots. This propo-
sition is not an effective means of 
combating the real problems of 
either voter apathy or the poor 
quality of candidates running for 
office in the election. It is not even 
worth the relatively low cost of 
implementation it would incur. 

Monday. March 2. 2000 

Propo~mof Pro~tioo D 
argue that it would increase interest 
in elections and allow dissatisfied 
voters to express their displeasure 
with candiddtes. They believe that 
this initiative would convince more 
citizens to register to vote, more 
registered voters to actually vote 
and attract a higher caliber of can-
didates to elections in California.

To the unin-
formed voter, 
Proposition 25 
seems like a 
good idea. The 
proposition, 
which is spon-
sored by mil-
lionaire Ron 
Unz, would establish contribu-
tion limits from single sources of 
$5,000 for statewide candidates, 
$3,000 for other candidates, 
525,000 for political parties and 
550,000 total per election. The 
proposition would also limit fund 
raising to 12 months before the 
primary election and 90 days 
after the election. In addition, 
Proposition .25 would provide 
public financing for campaign 
media advertisements and voter 
information packets for candi-
dates and committees adopting 
spending Iimim. 

The drawback of Proposition 
25 is that it would cost taxpayers 
an awesome sum of money to 
implement. Proposition 25 will 
cost taxpayers in excess of SS5 
million annually - money that 
would go to finance political 
advertising for candidates. Given 
that most Californians despise 
campaign ads, it seems ludicrous 
that they should be forced to foot 
the bill for them.

More worrisome, the limits set 
by Proposition 25 are impractical 
and unlikely to create any meaning-
ful campaign finance reform in the 
future. The limits were set ridicu-
lously high to ensure that they 
could get past the courts. However, 
last month's Supreme Court ruling 
implied that limits as low as 51,<XX> 
are acceptable. As a result, the 
much lower limits embodied in last 
election's Proposition 2(l! appear to 
be legal. In addition, Proposition 
2~, unlike Proposition 25, does not 
create loopholes for special interest 
groups. 

The Guardilm urges voters to 
resist casting their ba110m in favor of 
Proposition 25 and to instead wait 
for Pro~ition ~ to make its way 
through California's courts, after 
which it will hopefully take effect.

current two-
thirds vote, for 
school con- ~.;...,;;.,,;o,;,""'ioioioi" 
struction and improvement bonds 
and property taxes in excess of 
one percent to pay for bonds. 

California has a 12~year-old 
c:onstitutional protection requir-
ing a two-thirds vote to approve 
local bonds. These bonds are 
repaid only by property owners. 

We support more funding for 
local schools, as do the vast 
majority of Californians. That is 
why, under the current two-thirds 
rule, voters have approved 511.8 

billion in local school bonds in the 
past four years alone. 

Because school bonds are so 
popular with voters, they have 
been passed and we have every 
expectation that they will contin-
ue to be passed with a two-thirds 
vote. Under the proposed majori-
ty rule, bond issues could run 
rampant, forcing lIS to pay billions 
of dollars in interest money alone. 

Also, while all citizens are enti-
tled to vote on bond issues, only 
property owners repay the debts . 
Keeping the current two-thirds rule 
will ensure that property taxes are 
not raised against the will of prop-
erty owners, who will in tum have 
to pass the additional taxes on to 
rentersin the form of higher rent. 

Supporters say that Proposition 
26 makes it easier to raise money 
for schools to fight the educational 
crisis California is faced with. They 
hope that increased bond issues 
would allow schools to reduce 
class size, purchase more text-
books and expand facilities.

Proposition 10 established the 
California Children and Farnilies 
First Trust Fund by creating an 
additional 50 cent surtax on ciga-
rettes and other tobacco product 
sales. Proposition 28 would also 
ban future increases of tobacco 
product surtaxes unless such 
increases are passed by the state 
legislature. 

The Guardian feels that 
California voters have already 
expressed their support for 
Proposition 10 and that 
Proposition 28 is unfavorable 
because it would eliminate 
approximately $670 million annu-
ally in tobac<'O surtax revenues 
now reserved for the early child-
hood development .and anti-
smoking programs of the 
California Children and Families 
First Trust Fund. 

The proponents of Proposition 
28 argue that Proposition 10 created 
a needless bureaucracy and funds a 
childhood program that takes 
responsibility away from parents.

the 1998 com-
pacts negotiat-
ed between the .... ..;.;. ............. 
state of California and 11 California 
Indian tribes to allow these tribes to 
conduct limited gambling on their 
tribal lands. Proposition lA would 
nullify these compacts by granting 
more extensive compacts to all of 
California's Indian tribes. 

The arguments in favor of 
Proposition 29 are the same as those 
for 1 A - it would provide a bounti-
ful source of income for California's 
tribes and provide additional 
employment for California citizens 
in the newly created casinos. 

For those of you who disagree 
with Proposition lA, Proposition 
29 offers a more moderate altema-
tive. It grants limited gambling 
compacts to California Indian 
tribes that are consistent with 
Califomia's current constitutional 
limitations on gamblin~ - no 
house-banked card games or slot 
machines. If you are opposed to 
Nevada-style casinos in California, 
Proposition 29 would continue the 
limited gambling that is currently 
allowed on Indian reservations.

and encourage insurance fraud . 
However, Proposition 30 will 

only raise insurance rates for 
companies who are currently 
making money by failing to make 
payments or by accruing interest 
from delayed payments. 

Ideally, frivolous lawsuits are 
thrown out of court and do not cost 
tax payers any money. Additionally, 
Proposition 31 is designed to limit the 
number of frivolous lawsuits that can 
be filed if Proposition 30 does pass. 

Fear of insurance fraud is an 
entirely different matter, and there is 
no reason to continue to neglect a 
large number of law-abiding 
motorists who are maligned by 
insurance companies merely to stop 
a much smaller number of people 
who practice insurance fraud.

Proposition 
31 would limit 
the cases under 
Proposition 30 
in which insur-
ance compa-
nies could be 
sued. 

Proposition 
31 addresses one of the major argu-
ments against Proposition 30 - yet 
the opponents of Proposition 30, 
mainly insurance companies, also 
oppose 31. It is strange that they 
would ignore a proposition that 
addresses many' of their concerns 
with the original legislation - unless, 
of COI.IfSe, they have other motives for 
opposing the proposition, such as 
preserving the current system so they 
can continue to profit from it. 

Allowing claimants to sue insur-
ance companies that are negligent is 
an important consumer right, but 
there is the danger that unscrupu-
lous lawyers will abuse it. For this 
reason, Proposition 31 is an impor-
tant supplement to Proposition 30, 
and the Guardian editorial staff urges 
voters to pass both propositions.

Israeli Bill May Undercut Barak's Dealings JAPAN: 
Sect has provoked 
fear in country 

discovered in the raid, police said. 
The authorities said customer 

ledgers showed that the Japanese 
companies affected were major 
players in the electronics, food, 
banking, transportation and 
metal manufacturing fields. The 
most prominent corporate cus-
tomer was Nippon Telegraph at 
Telephone, or NTI. 

JERUSALEM Prime 
Minister Ehud Barak suffered a 
political blow Wednesday when 
three of the six parties in his 
coalition government joined 
forces with the opposition to 
approve a bill that would 
require an absolute majority of 
all eligible voters, and not just 
those who report to the polls, on 
any future referendum on peace 
with Syria. 

The bill, which would make 
any such future referendum 
extremely difficult to yass, 
revealed the instability 0 his 
broad-based coalition and com-
plicates his peacemaking efforts 
at a time when he is trying to 
entice Syria back to the negotiat-
ing table. 

The draft bill, which defied 
Barak's appeals for coalition 
unity, could well get tied up in 

LAPD: 
Rogue officer reports 
widespread abuses 
Continued from ..... 1 

Bernard C. Parks, said he was 
proud of his department for hav-
ing uncovered the wrongdoing, an 
assertion critics have widely dis-
puted. Those critics also contend-
ed Wednesday that Parks was 
using the report largely as a cudgel 
to fend off the growing demands 
for an outside investigation of the 
department's management. 

Parks did not propose taking 
any action again t officials who 
failed in their management 

committee deliberations and be 
prevented from returning to the 
floor for months. Many doubt it 
will ever become law. 

The bill's approval 
Wednesday, by a 60-53 vote, 
sends a signal to Syria, which is 
already skittish, that even if 
Barak is willing to concede the 
full Golan Heights in negotia-
tions, he may not be able to win 
public backing for what he 
promises. 

It also reveals a collapse of 
diSCipline within Barak's coali-
tion, points at the possibility of 
defections, and bodes ill for the 
array of key decisions ahead. 

In public comments, Barak 
characterized the vote as a "par-
liamentary trick" and said it 
would not deter him from his 
goals. 

"I don't take lightly what hap-

responsibilities, although he said 
a separate report might address 
them later. He also dismissed 
suggestions that he resign. 

The assessment issued 
Wednesday was undertaken near-
ly six months ago, after a rogue 
officer disclosed widespread abus-
es in an effort to red uce his sen-
tence for stealing cocaine from a 
police evidence room. He reported-
ly detailed wrongdoing at an anti-
gang unit, but now the investiga-
tion is extending to other divisions. 

The report included a list of 
108 recommendations for change, 
among them dozens of measures 
that would give top police offi-
cials more power and financing.

it," he said. "Some 1.8 million cit-
izens have given me a mandate 
to bring a new future to the state 
of Israel and no parliamentary 
trick will stop the majority from 
deciding its stand." 

The coalition parties that 
chose to challenge Barak rallied 
behind a young Likud leader, 
Silvan Shalom, who sensed the 
possibility to thwart Barak and 
limit prospects for peace with 
Syria at the same time. 

"What about all the things 
you promised, Mr. Prime 
Minister?" Shalom said, speak-
ing in the Parliament. "What 
happened to the social issues?"

Underscoring the immense 
fear that the sect provokes in 
Japan, the Defense Ministry and 
Nippon Telegraph at Telephone 
Corp., the country's main 
provider of telephone and 
Internet service, immediately sus-
pended the use of all romputer 
software developed by compa-
nies 1inked to Aum. The govern-
ment said it was considering 
doing the same at all its agencies. 

Among the governrnent agen-
cies affected are those for con-
struction, education and post and 
telecommunications, according to 
documents and commuter disks 

Many of the companies and 
agencies said they did not know 
they were ordering software 
from Aum-related firms because 
their main suppliers had sub-
contracted work to businesses 
affiliated to the sect. 

Although some of the orders 
had been placed under the cur-
rent government, officials did 
not come under immediate criti-
cism, in part because the many 
of the computer companies had 
also concealed their relationship 
toAum.

Child Murderer Troubled 
MOUNT MORRJS TOWN-

SHfr, Mich. - His father was in 
and out of prison. His mother, 
evicted from her own home, sent 
him and his brother to live with 
an unde in a clilapidated house 
here, just north of Flint. There, 
he did not even have his own 
bed and fell asleep in a place that 
neighbors say was filled with 
noise, drugs and guns. 

And on Tuesday, the 6-year-
old got his hands on one of those 
guns, stuffed it into his pants 
pocket and went off to first-grade, 
where he killed a classmate. 

On Wednesday, cars paused 

outside the white clapboard resi-
dence, as passersby tried to get a 
look at the home of a troUbled 
child, a boy who police say did 
not fully romprehend what he did 
when he used a .32-caliber hand-
gun on the 6-year-old girl, Kayla 
Renee Rolland. She was shot once 
in the neck just before 10 a.m. 
Tuesday in front of a group of 
about 22 first-graders as they 
made their way into the hall of the 
Thee J. Buell Elementary School. 

The boy put the gun in a .desk 
after the shooting and simply 
walked away. Questioned by 
detectives, the boy did not cry, 

police said, and afterward sat 
and drew pictures. 

"This young boy appears not 
to have many advantage~ in 
life," said Arthur A. Busch, the 
prosecutor. 

Although the authorities 
appeared to take a sympathetic 
attitude toward a young child 
who look another child's life, 
many residents said the real 
sympathy belonged with 
Kayla's family and questioned 
whether it was safe to send their 
children back to school.

Father and Son - the only 
father and son hip-hop duo in 
San Diego or perhaps the world 
- is on the rise. In the past year 
alone, Father and Son have per-
formed with hip-hop stars such 
as Kurtis Blow and the Whoori-
daz, have appeared on television 
and radio, and have been nomi-
nated for Best Hip-Hop Act at the 
Los Angeles Music Awards. As a 

crowning achievement they have 
released rna Worlz A Stagt, one of 
the most exciting local recordings 
to date. 

11uJ Worlz A SfIlge takes the 
form of a typical hip-hop record: 
There are - beats and samples; 
there is rapping and some 
singing; then! are lyrical themes 
that run throughout the album. 
Some of the songs are upbeat 
dance-floor tracks and others are 
relaxing slow-jams. The produc-
tion on Th4 Worlz A SfIlgt IS prim-
itive but effective, featunng a 
bass-heavy old-school sound that 
recalls classic Bay Area artists 
such as Too Short and tfie RBL 
Posse. The tracks serve their pur-
pose well, providing a backdrop 
for the rhyming of Nicholas Han-
ton Senior and Nicholu Hanton 
Junior, San Diego's favorite fami-
ly rap group. 

The lyrics on 11uJ Worlz A SfIlgt 
are amazing. The Hantons rap 
freely about touchy subjects that 
many fathers and sons are unable 
to discuss even in privacy. This 
Father and Son team is proving 
that hip hop can be a wonderful 
tool for maintaining family.

C ... ,.I •• .., 

Although the Reverend A.K. 
Skurgis manages to include the 
Iongest word in the English Ian· 
guage (antidisestablishmentanta-

• 

rianism) on his self-released 
recording, this disc is not for 
book-lovers. It is a collection of 
consumers' love songs, odes to 
the Trans Am and JUdgeaUd, 
cheap weed and pizza. Althou 
Skurgis' tongue is planted· y 
in hiS cheek as he conducts his 
lyrical survey of strip-mall cul· 
ture, the listener is left wondering 
if the Reverend is trUly in love 
with white trash, filled with 
hatftd, or merely a victim. 

With production values that 
can be described as deliberately 
amateurish, the focus is on Skur-
gis' lyrics. Whether singing over 
country-style acoustic guitars or 
gothic keyboard arrangements, 
he delivers his words with a s1op-
py intensity that recalls Dead 
Kennedy Jello Biafra, sometime8 
prt!S6ing too many words into 
verses in order to make a po"t, 
sometimes drawing them ou 
when there is nothing left to ~( 
However, where Biafra's lyriC; 
are unified by a coherent political 
agenda, Skurgis displays a lack of 
focus that links him more closely 
to Biafra's schizop'~n;nic street-
musician protege. Wesley Willis. 

The Reverend takes us on an 
interesting ride, to be sure. His 
words are at times heartbreaking-
ly honest, and the music accom-
panying him is oc:casionaIly bril-
liant, but this recording still may 
not be universaDy appealing.

lot very commercial fi1ms because it is not 
the whole thing that is commercial. You 
have a zone in 'between that is stunning. 
For example, 'Terminator 2' is a banal ana 
trite film in terms of the story, yet you have 
effects to die for. When you have a cyborg 
versus Schwarzenegger fighting, when 
you realize you have, in the ume frame, 
something which is of the analog level of 
the image and of the digital leVel of the 
image. So this is where you really realize 
that somethin~ ex~rdinary has been 
made possible through the technology. 

'Therefore, within commercial cinema, 
you see art cinema as well as art aspects, 
and vice versa. In art films, at some 
moment the director is tired, at some 
moment there is a lapse moment, and you 
move on to something which is not so 
experimental and avant-garde. You have 
to take this into consideration. A movie is 
going to be something which is less spe-
cific than film. A film is really a sharp 
object that makes you die to study.

You can technically see the poetics of a film 
as it unfolds. And so, you can see recursive 
objects in a film. You can also see the means 
of cinema at work: how a particular film 
has a certain number of strategic dissolves, 
how a film uses music at a certain moment, 
how editing is functioning. So, all the 
means of cinema seem to be in display that 
can be studied technically. 

This is the beginning - the late '70s, 
early '80s when VCRs "became democra-
tized. when you can tell your c1ass 'Buy 
this Hitchcock film. We'U study it for the 
next three weeks: 

This has been enhanced aU the more so 
when after video tapes, we moved on to

ple, the resolution of the image is such 
that you can not only be more pleased, not 
only do you have instant access without 
losing fractions of a second in the shot that 
you are studying, but you have shot res0-
lution, which gives you a clearer indica-
tion of what you want to study and how 
you want to study it. Things appeared on 
the screen that you could not even see on 
the video image. 

At the tiJlle of video image, you could 
reaDy say to people, "'Well, it's nothing like 
seeing it in the theater on the big screen.' 

How do you approach 
a film and have criteria, 
so that you can decide 
afterward if it is good or 
not? You've got to see the 
internal composition of 
the film. So you do study 
it frame by frame, shot by 
shot, sequence by 
sequence. Afterward, you 
have to study the level of 
the narrative unfolding 
that you have in the film, 
as you would with a 
novel or short atl:lry. But 
you also see the poetics of 
recurrences of certain 
images, of certain 
sounds, of certain edit 

With the ~r disc and the shot resolu-
tion, and with the projection of the laser

nothing compared to laser discs them-

. tor wanted it. 
Imagine, in terms of 

cinema, having had a 
restoration, literally, from 
the video effect to the dig-
ital effect. If the '80s could 
be considered the video 
age, we can reaDy say that 
tile '90s and the new cen-
tury ~ the • .ol digital. 
But this is more than just 
technical, it leads to a 
new perception. It leads 

strategies, of how the light is used. You 
also have to cross-reference the style of the 
director vis-a-vis his or her previous films, 
the genre and then the history of cinema. 

Take 'Casino' by Scorsese. 'Casino' is 
going to be situated vis-a-vis Las Vegas 
movies, but it is also going to be situated 
¥is-A-vis the Mafia genre in Las Vegas. You 
also situate it vis-A-vis all the movies 
Scorsese has made previously, before he 
got to 'Casino.' You also see all the direc-
tors who have worked on Las Vegas and 
the Mafia genre. So you are constantly 
cross-referencing, situating it vis-a-vis the 
history of cinema, the history of the direc-
tor, the history of the genre. At the same 

ti~, you are really trying to see what sur-
p~ you in this film. 

Its I like to say, all the laws of deduc-
tion, all the laws of logic, all the laws of 
induction are going to be helpful to the 
extent that you will be able to account for 
the surprise that this film has created for 
y If you do not have a certain surprise, 
yone going to say 'It's hackn~ed. It's 
banal. I've seen this film before. U s like all 
the other films about the war, the other 
films about sex and death ... : Instead it's 
how the film treats the subject, and how I 
am caught by surprise by the film, that is 
going to make the difference. So, baSically, 
the short answer to a good film is finding 
that you are surprised, that you have a 
new ethics, a new aesthetics, a new poli-
tics, or your categories are chaDenged and 
then moving backward retroactively to see 
how that surprise was constructed for you. 
How lies teoIInlloD c ..... d ...

I think it's very interesting to note that, 
in the field of film studies, you can date an 
article before and after the VCR. It's amaz-
ing how, when you read an article before 
1978-79, when we start being democra-
tized. It's amazing to see how imprecise 
people are vis-A-vis the object that they are 
studying. 

With the VCR, all of a sudden, 
overnight, a whole generation was formed 
that could be very technical, very precise in 
terms of some discussion .of a film's study. 
Instead of saying something like 'I like this 
film becauae •••• I like that film becauae .•. : 
Instead of saying the film has track shots, 

to a new aesthetic. It leads 
to a new cognition. It means that all your 
philosophical categories will be enhanced 
by having access to ~ new technology 
and by using it in order to find a synergy 
between your specific study and, at the 
same time broader studies. 
.... do,.. ...... -* ....... ...., .... 
............ , 

We have to think that that which is erot-
ic and sensuous, and could be borderline 
pornographic to some or part of another 
genre for others, is really linked in this 
kind of double bind that desire brings clos-
er and art brings farther. Art distentiates. 

Every time you have something very 
sensuous in cinema, the quality of the 
image, the look of the body, you are simul-
taneously posing that sensuality, that 
body, as an object of desire, therefore 
brought closer. Yet if it is represented in 
terms of art, [it is) brought farther so that 
you have this double bind between desire 
bringing closer and art distentiating. 
Hence, the pleasure really with a great 
director who deals with sensuousness, 
who deals with the body, and who really 
takes the nude the same way as you have 
in art history, the landscape, in still life, 
portraiture. You see the level at which 
they are working sexuality, making the 
spectator voyeur, and at the same time 
sexuality, making it an object of art. 

Hence the pleasure of seeing somebody 
like Greenaway - Godard is unbelievable 
as well - in terms of dealing with eroti-
cism and the same time a nonpomograph-
ic threshold. When the great director 
works with it, it's a thrill because you are 
constantly playing between one and the 
other. To maintain that effect - doser-far-
ther, closer-farther - is a trait of genius.

There are so many. There are so many. 
Going to film festivals, it's stunning to see 
that you have your blue chip directors, 
from who you expect the most. You can't 
wait for the new Scorsese or you can't wait 
for the new film by your favorite other 
director. On the other hand, you are con· 
stantly surprised by the new generation 
and how they treat their object.

Filrncriticsp~y 
driven by deadlines 
ContInued froIII pap U 

Just to give you a quick 
answer, I think Spike Jonze's 
'Being John Malkovich' is a 
tremendous film. The guy has 
captured so much in terms of the 
culture. It would be discriminat-
ing on my part to limit myself to 
one director. or two or three 
because you're bombarded by the 
talent that you see around you. 
Wltllt 1IIIIk •••• ood film

The field of films studies is 
very wide. You have people who 
come to it from very different 
fields. In other words, you have 
people who are in literature, you 
have people who are in history, 
you have people in philosophy, 
you have people in sociology, you 
have people in anthropology. 

It's amazing to see how much 
affluence there is that leads to the 
fie ld of film studies. So, it 
depends on the problematics that 
each scholar, or each diSCipline, is 
setting. 

enormous kaleidoscope that 
encompasses all these possibilities 
and that you have different ways 
of approaching the phenomenon 
of cinema. In my studies, I reaDy 
want to account for the internal 
composition of the film. I'm very 
much committed to the theory of 
cinema where the director has a 
vision and is in control. I want to 
see the style of a particular direc-
tor and the psychology that is 
inherent in the making of a partic-
ular film. I also want to cross-ref-
erence it with and compare it with 
the genre of films. I want to see 
how the The Thin Red Line' com-
pares to the history of war films, 
how the 'The Thin Red Line' com-
pares to 'Saving Private Ryan,' 
how it compares to ot!· r war 
films, whether it is in the Pacific 
Theater, whether it is in the Euro-
pean Theater of World War II or 
whether it is in the genre of war 
. films in generaL You've got to 
compare this as well. 

Then, I really want to see how 
a film creates its own salience vis-
a-vis a culture and how it defines 
a culture and becomes emblemat-
ic of a culture at the same time 
that it is defined by the culture. 

The UCSD Guardian 

we're all hot about what is being 
shown. That is why we all flock to 
film festivals. That is why we 
know that it is the hottest field in 
the world at this point.

A good symptom. They never 
fail to show what is at stake this 
particular year, or what problem-
atics is gnawing at a culture. It's 
always a surprise, in this or that 
category, who is going to make it 
and who doesn't. It's wonderful, 
and not, to see an independent 
study, an independent film like 
'The English Patient' making it 
against bigger studios. 

On the other hand, indepen-
dent film festival director Robert 
Redford said that the indepen-
dent is trying to belong to the stu-
dio system. So it's not as if you 
have a unique desire - on the 
one hand, the independent, on 
the other hand, the commercial 
cinema. No, we aU want to get to 
the level of being seen and being 
applauded by the greatest possi-
blenumber.

In other words, I like to have a 
very solid film analysis, a very 
technicdl film analysiS, through 
which I'm going to be able to phi-
losophize and to find an aesthetic, 
an ethic, a politics. On th , other 
hand, I can see very much how 
friends of mine, historians of cin-
ema, are studying audiences in 
the '20s, audiences of this particu-
lar film. They' re doing, really, 
journalistic research into what the 
audience went after at that partic-
ular movie's opening, what they 
booed, what they applauded and 
what films people were catching 
on a date in the '50s. They're real-
ly after a very different animal. 

This what is so gorgeous about 
an object that is made for a mass 
audience. It costs a lot of money. It 
is a collaborative art, and you can-
not complain about the fact that is 
cost so much money to make 
because if you do complain, you 
might as well make a painting and 
be by yourself and seD on a much 
smaller scale and not be involved 
with the whole distribution system 
and not be involved with the 
whole cost of printing your film. 
You've got to accept that. 

A film critic for a newspaper 
or a magazine is really moved by 
an immediate deadline. If you go 
to a film festival and you're a 
journalist you've got to giverour 
answer, your evaluation 0 the 
film, over night or by the week-
end. Irs the same thing with a 
weekly or monthly deadline.

UCSD ·Crowd 'Caught' By David Parsons 
New York-based Parsons Dance Company delivers a stanning as well as engaging performance 
., HAMWI ~'iih 
Stllff Writer 

lIluminated only by the slow 
flashes of a strobe light, the lone 
dancer levitated around the stage 
to tranquil, spacy music. 
"Caught," one of David Parson's 
most famous dances, was the 
undisputed highlight of last 
Wednesday's performance by the 
Parson's Dance Company. The 
choreography is not complex and 
there was only one dancer on 
stage for the piece, but as its name 
implies, "Caught" was superbly 
captivating - even hypnotizing . 

With its virtually nonstop 
jumping (in the darkness 
betWeen strobe light flashes), the 
dmce was quite an athletic as 
well as technical feat. This con-
trasted with the perceived illu· 
sion of smoothness and spaciness 
to create an even greater effect. 
The audience recognized this and 
gave a standing ovation to dancer

their own film. Of course [critics 
and directors] need each other. 
They live in a parallel universe. 
WIIIIt ...... lint ft .. out 
now? 

I think Jonze's 'Being John 
Mal kovich' is perhaps part of a 
great formation that he had in 
video art as well, leading us to 
thinking about the question of 
simulation - Malkovich prolifer-
ating beyond control; Simulation, 
being perhaps one of the hot sub-
jects about cultur . -

I mentioned the last Scorsese 
film, 'Bringing Out the Dead,' 
leading you back to 'Taxi Driver,' 
1976, that you've got to see again. 
Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a 
delight and perfectly crafted gem. 
'Cruel Intentions' is a new ver-
,sion of the 18th-century leg-
endary novel Dangerous Llaisons 
and Greenaway's 'Eight and a 
Half Women' is deliciously deli-
cate and perverse. 

What are the best films? There 
are so many, that it is impossible 
!p say, but you can say, the films 
that lead you to that salience, to 
that difference, to that surprise 
that we're dying for are going to 
be the best films out. 

It's really unfair to single out 
one film. You have to distinguish 
between the different genres. If 
you're dealing with experimental 
and avant-garde cinema, you 
can't put it in the same basket as 
the wider-narrative films that are 
out there and that are catching 
people because it's a thriller or 
because it's a neonoir. You cannot 
compare them. You have an audi-
ence that goes specifically to 
experimental films. It's really as if 
you were going to a poetry read-
ing. I would really like to pay 
homage to the people who are 
functioning in experimental cine-
ma and poetic and avant-garde 
cinema. I'm moved by 50 many 
things, that I cannot be pinned 
down to Single type of film. 

I have no prejudices against 
very commercial films. I would 
say that 'The Matrix' is a master-
piece. 'The Matrix' leads you to a 
study of levels of reality and unre-
ality, where you can no longer dif-
ferentiate between this and that 
level. Therefore, you are lost in a 
maze of levels where you no 
longer know what is referential 
and what is imaginary. Everything

Jamie Martinez at the end of the 
performance. "Caught" should 
have been last on the night's pro-
gram instead of "Anthem," a 
beautiful but slightly overlong 
dance criticizing nationalism and 
flag-waving fervor. 

In the comedic second piece 
"Sleep Study," dancers spent vir-
tually the entire time lying or 
rolling on the ground. Much of 
the choreograpny was quotidian 
movement instead of difficult, 
technical dancing, but the seven 
lazy figures in bright-colored 
pajamas roDed over and turned 
their heads with a grace that 
escapes most dancers. As in 
"Caught," Parsons' "Sleep 
Study" took a simple idea and 
masterfully expanded it into a 
wonderfuny entertaining dance. 

The idea behind "Sleep St\ldy" 
is the children's ditty abOut bed-
time restlessness: "'there t«rt six 
in tM bed/And the little one SIIid:/ 
Roll uvn, roll (1M' j So tMy /III roIlftl 

over ... " . 
Near the end of the piece, five 

dancers lying next to each other 
rolled simultaneously to the left; 
the petite Mia McSwain, "asleep" 
on top of them, came along for 
the ride, gracefuUy undulating as 
she was rolled across their backs. 

Not an egomaniac like so 
many choreographers who have 
companies named after them, 
Parsons lets some of his dancers 
set pieces on the company. Three 
of the dances on the first half of 
the program, "Strange Humors," 
"Damn, and "Rush Hour," were 
cho~aphed by dancer Robert 
Battle (the lone, stiD sleeper from 
"Sleep Study. H). 

In "Damn," the lights came up 
on one dancer stanaing upstage 
center. As the dance progressed, 
she gradually came forward, 
barely deviating from her straight 
path even as her dancing became 
increasingly frantic. 

Every so often she would stop 

and hold out six fingers. Her 
movements become faster and 
faster, and although she would 
pause and try to draw herself 
together, it was clear that she was 
losing control. At the end, she 
gave a last desperate wail of 
movement an collapsed on the 
last note of the music. Danced by 
veteran company member Eliza-
beth Koeppen, "Damn" was a 
concise, intense portrait of 
descent. 

"Strange Humors" was less 
intense but no less engaging. A 
peculiar mood was set by the . 
movements of two bare-chested 
men and was enhanced by yel-
low-orange lighting and cos-
tumes. One dancer displayed a 
thoroughly amaZing way of 
rolling his torso in one huge 
undulation. Much of the move-
ment carried this same liquidity. 
There was also a flow of tension, 
attraction and nuance between 
the two dancers, who seemed to 

be luxuriatinf in their own move-
ments as wei as their interactions 
with each other. Such movement 
9uality and moods made 
'Strange Humors" wonderful to 
watch. 

As the program notes state, 
Parsons is dedicated to dance 
education. When approached by 
a dance student after the perfor-
mance, the first thing out of his 
mouth was not "Did you like the 
show?" but "Vou took the master 
class? How did she do?" - A ref-
erence to Mia McSwain, the 
seven-year company member 
who had taught the class (and has 
done an excellent job). 

This is something that those 
interested should be aware of: 
Frequently, when a touring dance 
company comes to at UCSD, it 
offers a master class for advanced 
and intermediate dance students 
the day of the performance. For 
more information, caU the dance

becomes intertwined. You're mov-
ing back and forth between all 
these levels and you start enjoying 
a heightened sense of the percep-
tion of the film image because you 
do not know where you are situat-

I think it is related to the ques-
tion of technology. The fact that 
we can freeze frame, stop the 
film, replay instantaneously the 
scene that we enjoyed ~r that cre-
ated a problem. 

When people buy a tape, they 
don't replay the film from begin-
ning to end eVf>ry time. They 
replay their favonte sequences. 
The very act of fast forwarding is a 
critical reaction to a film. In other 
words, you're fast forwarding to a 
scene that you really enjoy that 
you want to study, but it reaJ,ly 
gives you pain beca~se you want 
to see how it is constructed. 

This is perhaps one of the mag-
nificent element of the new tech-
nologies, making the whole cul-
ture more critical, more theoretical, 
more philosophical, more aesthetic 
in terms of the object of cinema. 
Instead of having a passive single 
vision of going to a second screen-
ing of a film, or going for a third or 
fourth time, you are selective. 

I made the case that the remote 
control, by flipping channels, has 
made the whole country much 
more inteIJigent. You see very 
quickly where the narratives are 
leading. You're not after that, you 
are after a higher sensation, a 
higher perception, a higher intel-
lect, instead of being stuck with a 
particular channel or a single film 
or a single TV program.

I think nothing'S right, noth-

I think it's magnificent to see 
the shift between the analog Image 
and the digital image. The juxtapo-
sition within the same frame for 
example in 'Tenninator 2' or in 
'Jurassic Park' makes you feel very 
excited because we see the transi-
tion occurring, in terms of the 
image, right in front of our eyes. 
This is a very exciting time for cin-
ema. Instead of deplOring Holly-

very carefully, and study veJ)lcare-
fully the new technology. Holly-
wood is us, how can we aepiOre it?

It's kind of a rack focus between 
the two. Except in experimental 
films and avant-garde, which are 
purely poetic, basically, the narra-
tive is a safety net. The narrative is 
there to permit the film to !IOar into 
directions .:>f the visuals, of the 
Sound, of the editing, of the li~t. 

Look at 'Lost Highway, for 
example. The narrative seems to 
unfold along a series of possible 
lines. You can construct your nar-
rative, but basicaIJy you go after 
those divine images of sex in the 
desert, of the construction of 
flashbacks that are not flashbacks, 
'the fact that you are fooled by the 
story. On the one hand you need 
the narrative, without which you 
would have pure poetry in cine-
rna. At the same time, you want 
to depart from it ,as often as you 
can because basically you realize 
that you have a begirining, mid-
dle and an end, not necessarily on 
that order, as Godard said, but 
you are basicaIJy watching and 
unfolding. You're not after that. 
You're after, literally, the sawing 
effect. This is what cinema is.

Greenaway described how he 
was very influenced by the 'Sev-
enth Seal' by Ingmar Bergman that 
came out in 1957. I never had a 
marking moment where I realized 
'Aha! Cinema is something else. 
There's really an art form there: 

I think from the start, I realize 
it was an art form. From the word 
'go: I knew, I felt, that it was one 
of the greatest art forms in the 
world. The same way as I was 
taken to the Louvre to write about 
paintings, when you're brought 
with your school at age eight and 
sitting on the floor, I took cinema 
at face value from the start. 

It's later that I realized that 
there could be a distinction 
between an art film and a com-
mercial film. I never made a dis-
tinction at the start. I enjoy just as 
much Chaplin a~ I enjoy Bergman 
as I enjoy all the French new 
wave. I cannot say with the same 
degree of certainty, as Greenaway 
could say about the "Seventh 
Seal", that there was a film that 
marked my life. From the start I 
was there, and r wanted to make 
films, but my privilege is to teach 
films instead of making films. 
What ............ ,.. ...... 
-.." ... lte_ ........... ., 

We play that game in SOCiety. 
What are the must-see films. What 
are the best 10 films of the year. I 
think cinema is made by the book-
end geniuses Eisens~ein, Godard: 
the Russian genius, the French 
genius of the new wave. 

On the other hand you have so 
many really master directors: 
Orson WeJles, Kurosawa, Hitch-
cock, Antonioni, Kubrick, David 
Lynch. Instead of having a canon 
of 10 necessary films, I have a uni-
versal appetite for cinema. I think 
you should see everything you 
can, all the time. As soon as you 

made by a character in a Kubrick 
film, you've got to confront your-
self with the same ethics, as in eth-
ical judgment. It is no longer your 
moral principle. It's how, in this 
situation, would I react myself? 

It really is very important to see 
everything. See everything. See 
everything. Even if you find a film 
repulsive, annoying or boring, you 
Ieam something and extract some-
thing, and that is what is so impor-
tant about seeing everything. 
WIIIcIII ........ IIJIIION to • "l1li, 
........... or ...... ector? 

Well I'm very prejudice. If 
you're after great adfng, great 
performers, I say, go to the theater. 
It's the actor's medium. Cinema is 
really the director's medium. The 
actors are interchangeable. Of 
course a great performance 
counts. Who am I not to recognize 
Brando screaming 'Stella' that the 
film would be dead? 

The great actors of cinema rec-
ognize how much the director's 
creativity matters for her perfor-
mance. In 'Basic Instinct,' you 
only remember Sharon Stone and 
are absolutely amazed by her per-
formance. But, without the great 
direction and great editing and 
decisions made, it would not be 
the sa,!,e film. If you're really 
after the performance of a direc-
tor, you go to the cinema. 
WIIIIt *»,.. ...... fill .......

I am very excited. I've always 
been excited by animation. '1 
heard a fantastic talk at a confer-
ence recen!ly where someone 
pointed out that certain charac-
ters in animation reflected the 
elec.:tric age, how others reflected 

...... .., 
It can be in several directions. 

In terms of the university and 
scholarship, it can remain frag-
mented: with the literature peo_ 
ple, with the visual arts people, 
with the philosophy people, with 
the communications people in 
terms of studying cinema. It can 
brought under the same roof, but 
on the other hand, you would still 
need to do architecture in films, 
philosophy in the films, story 
telling and poetry in cinema. It 
can go in either direction. 

You have a formidable body of 
work, close to a 100,000 films that 
have been made; not to mention 
all the other television produc-
tions in film, which are sometimes 
very good. So you have 100,(XX) 
films made, in which you have a 
formidable body of work, which 
is begging, crying out, for analy-
sis, for dissection, for giving a sign 
of a culture. I think it makes the 
field one of the most gigantic 
fields of endeavor and of research 
that has ever been devised. 

It constitutes itself in front of 
our very eyes, since we are all 
children of the 20th century, 
watching in awe of our creation 
of the medium and at the same 
time bein~ defined by the medi-
um. That s why people say, in 
such a banal way, 'Let's catch a 
flick. Let's see that movie. Have 
you seen this and that?' 

It is both a cultural, banal 
object, and at the same time, it 
could cl) sa1i~nce .and tran-
scendence and give you a sense of 
immortality.

FENCING: 
Men and women fight 
their way to season title 
ContInued from ..... 20 
first in epee, first in sabre and second in toil. 

Despite losing the foil bout against 
Fullerton, UCSD's Wes Bellanca held on to 
his number-one individual spot in the 
conference. 

UCSO's Shawn Pfeil was tied for second 
in epee going to the meet and fin-
ished the day. second in the con-
ference. 

The men rebounded 
against Cal Tech and 
the only dose 
was in the sabre catego-
ry. 

UCSD's Tedd 
Padgitt downed Cal Tech's Cory Loomis 
for the victory, helping the men gather the 
season sabre and overall title. 

The men had never taken the sabre title 
before, and this was their first epee title 
since 1986. 

The women had a better season finish 
as they captured the top individual spot in 
every weapon. 

Foilist Julia Kulla-Mader, who was in 
competition to finish at number one in the 
conference in epee, forfeited her chances 
to compete for a number two finish in the 
foil category. Kulla-Mader came through 
as she took every foil competition against 
Fullerton. She also finished fourth overall 
in epee for the season. 

The Tritons' Jo Roberts also won all of 
the foil bouts to take the top spot in the 
conference. 

In the epee competition, Hannah Griffith 
and Jeanette Wenzel picked up the slack 
with the absence of Kulla-Mader to down 
Fullerton. This gave Griffith the number-

one spot in women's epee for the season. 
UCSO's Maylan Dahan, who usually 

fences epee, competed in the sabre for the 
first time. She combined with Jessica 
Spuehler, who finished the year at first 
place in sabre, to down Fullerton 7-2. 

"Jessica Spuehler is phenomena!," Lee 
said. "It's her first year fencing and the 
first year sabre has been offered; she's just 
caught on quickly. Plus, she's fast. She's 
just not playing fencing; she really fences. 
This is the difference between her and oth-
ers in the conference." . 

Against Cal Tech, UCSD easily 
took foil and epee but 
fell in sabre. 

The sabre loss did 
not affect the conference 

standing, as UCSD finished 
second in sabre as a team. 

Roberts took the individual title. 
"I Roberts) went undefeated 

Saturday," said Lee. "She's a contender for 
nationals. She's top five in the region." 

The women's title in epee is their sixth 
consecutive, having taken it every year 
the event has existed. 

"I think we have a lot of depth on the 
team," Lee said. "The individuals sacrifice 
their individual standings for the team." 

UCSD will not have much time to miss 
Fullerton and Cal Tf'lCh as it will face both of 
them, along with Stanford and Air Force in 
the NCAA ¥kst ReKional Championships 
in Pasadena a week hom Saturday. 

"I think we will beat Fullerton," Lee 
said. "We'll want revenge. I think Stanford 
will beat us. They're Division I and one of 
the strongest teams in the country. Air 
Force is stro~1t will be close." 

"We're ma ' history on our team," 
finished Lee.' . Is far and away the 
best team we've had. This year I've put 
more emphasis on the team 'and not [on 
the! individual. The individuals have 
made sacrifices."

TENNIS: 
Victory over Villanova is 
revenge for last season 
c.. ........... ,.... 
out Villanova's number-one team, 8-6. 

At number two doubles, Dan'Albrecht 
and Michael Meyer had a relatively easy 
time with their opponents, taking them 
out, 8-5. 

"It was the first that Dan and I real-
ly played well together," Meyer 
said. "I was happy with our per-
formance." 

At number three dou-
bles, Ari Frankel and Ryan 
Thompson were locked in 
a close battle with their 
opponents before emerging vic-
torious, 8-6. 

The sweep in doubles was a big vic-
tory. It gave the Tritons the lone doubles 
point and a 1-0 lead heading into the sin-
gles competition. 

In singles the Tritons were dominant, 
winning five of the six matches they 
played. 

At number one singles, Meyer had a 
tough competitor in Robery Waibel from 
Vmanova. 

"He had a big serve and a real big fore-
hand, H Meyer said. "I tried to loop it to his 
backhand because he made a lot of mis-
takes. When I was losing games it was 
because 1 was giving him chances to hit 
forehand winners." 

Meyer was able to work his strategy 
well enough to emerge as the winner with 
a score of 6-4, 6-3. 

"I played better than I did in the 
IWestern New Mexico University) 
match," Meyer said, "But I wasn't as con-
sistent as I wanted to be." 

At number two doubles, Moderhak 

had a much tougher time than he did in 
the previous match when he easily won, 
6-0,6-1. 

This time Moderhak was pushed but 
more than earlier came out on top, 6-3, 6-
3. 

At number three singles, Albrecht con-
tinued his quest back from injury and was 
again pushed as he was in his previous 
match. Albrecht won the first set, 6-2, but 
lost the second set, 3-6. Just as in his last 
match, Albrecht was able to win the third 

set and the match, this time by a score 
of 6-2. 

Thompson lost at number 
four singles with a score of 4-
6, 2-6. This was the Tritons 
only singles loss on the day. 

Frankel had possibly the 
most exciting match of the 

day, winning the first set in a tie-
breaker before getting down early in 

the second set. Frankel came back and 
took out his opponent, 7-5, in the set to 
win the match. . 

At number six singles, Scott Anderson 
had an easy time in the first set and won, 
6-1. 

The second set was a totally different 
story as Anderson was pushed the entire 
way. In the end, Anderson emerged with 
the 7-5 victory. 

The 6-1 victory runs UCSD's record to 
an impressive 5-2 on the year. 

Next up for UCSD is Redlands 
University, the match that the team had 
circled in red since the beginning of the 
year. 

"I think we are all pretty pumped for 
Redlands," Meyer said. MIt shourd be a 
great match." 

That match takes place Friday after-
noon at Redlands. The match will go a 
long way in deciding who will join UC 
Santa Cruz as the second representative 
from the West in nationals this season.

Portland Dominant 
Team in NBA's West 

OK Laker fans, consider 
me your devil's advocate .. 

I am sure that most of you 
are really excited about the win 
the Lakers had over Portland 
two nights ago. Well, I am here 
to tell you why the Lakers will 
not win the NBA title this year. 

First of all, the Lakers are 
not nearly consistent enough 
to go through the playoffs and 
win four consecutive series 
against quality teams. Sure, 
they had times when they 
looked like the best team in 
the league. I have no doubt 
that if they keep these players 
that they will eventually be 
the best team in the league, 
but they aren' t this year. 

Right now they look really 
good . They were good 
enough to beat the 
Trailblazers (the league's best 
team) by three points on 
Tuesday night. They looked 
good when they went on their 
16-game-win streak earlier in 
the season. 

Then they go through peri-
ods like they did at the end of 
the first half when every game 
seemed like a struggle and 
losses were jLlst as likely as 
wins. You have to win consis-
tently to be successful in the 
playoffs. Because of their 
inconsistency, the Lakers may 
not even get to the Western 
Conference Finals against the 
Trailblazers. 

In a seven-game series, the 
Lakers have no chanr.e against 
Portland. Los Angeles has no 
answer for Rasheed Wallace. 
Although Sabonis is no match 
for Shaq, he can do enough 
things on the offensive side of 
the ball to make it &0 the cen-
ter position isn't a total disas-
ter for Portland. 

The other matchup that 
people talked about before 
Tuesday's game was compar-
ing Kobe Bryant to Scottie 
Pippen. Bryant was supposed . 
to double Pippen's offensive 
output if the Lakers were to 
win. This didn't happen and it 
won't happen in the playoffs 
either.

Late Surge Leads 
UCSD to Blow-out 
TIDAL WAVE: After a slow start, the Tritons score seven 
runs in the final three innings ,to demolish Claremont 1 i-3 
Sy TAIl MIUER 
Staff Writer 

The Triton baseball team traveled to 
Claremont College on Tuesday and, in a lop-
sided 11-3 victory, improved its record to an 
impressive 8 and 1. 

The final score was misleading, 
howevp.r, the Claremont team, despite 
event<lally taking the loss, showed 
signs of life early as it hopped out 
to a quick 1-0 !ead in the bottom 
of the first. 

The Stags I~doff man reached 
ba~ on a double. After the Tritons 
recorded an out, another man got on 
wher. he was hit by a pitch, i¥'d then 
the Stags scored their first run on a RBI 
single by their cleanup hitter. 

With two men still on and Claremont 
posed to add to their lead, Alex Cremidan, 
the Triton pitcher, struck out two of the next 
three batters to end the inning and squashed 
the Stags' threat. 

From this point on, the Triton pitchers, 
including Alex Cremidan, who was joined on 
thP. mound by Joo." Beaven, Andy Holloway 
and Brian Hinson, stymied the Stag's offense, 
allowing only one hit over the next seven 
innings. 

Claremont maintained its 1-0 lead until 
the fourth inning, when the Triton bats 

that was all they could muster, and the game 
ended with the Tritons on top 11-3. 

The Tritons received good production 
from the whole lineup on Tuesday, as six dif-
ferent people scored runs and eight different 
people recorded hits. 

Chris Tallman and Brian Terrel account-
ed for six of these runs and each had two 

hits. John Beaven, number 12, 
recorded the win fOl the Tritons as 
he pitched the seconcl, third, 
, fourth and fifth innings. 

Coach Dan O'Brien, when 
asked what made the difference 
in the game, said that it wa& it 

total team effort. In additiou he wid 
that the team Nswung the bats well 

and got some good pitching." 
Interestingly enough, this game was nei-

ther a league nor nonleague contest for the 
Tritons. While Claremont belongs to the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference, the Tritons are an independent 
team. This means that they have no affiliation 
with any league and are free to play 
whomever they wa."t. Cecause of Jhls fact, 
O'Brien said that his team plays ellle of the 
tougher schedules in Division m baseball. The Trailblazers have the best bench in the league and 

the Lakers have one I)f the 
poorer bP.nches among the top 
contenders. [)..lring a seven-
game series this will become 
crucial. Shaq and Bryant can-
not play 48 minutes in all 
seven games. 

Finally, the most important 
reason that the Trailblazers 
will win is that they are just a 
more mature team. Sure, 
some of them are thugs, but 
they have tne experience and 
the talent to g~t to the 
promised land. TI-.e Lakers are 
still a year away from having 
confidence and the experience 
to win when the going gets 
tough. 

• awoke and scored three runs on two dou-
bles, an error and a single. UCSD tacked on 
another run in the fifth inning to make the 
score 4-1. Matt Merrfield scored the run in 
the fifth. 

While they are not affiliated with a league, 
the Tritons can still qualify for playoffs. In 
baseball, p!c:1'oifs are deciaed on a regional 
basis. The Tritons belong to the western 
region and if they finish the year with a good-
enough record, they will be admitted to the 
postseason. 

However, a\l of this will change next year 
when the Tritons move up to Division n and 
become affiliated with the NCAA. 

I know most of you dis-
agree with me, but we will see 
what happens in the playoffs. 
When it is aU said and done, 
Pippen will have another title 
and the Lakers will be at home 
wondering what went wrong. 

Although (hey managed just one hit in 
the first three innings, the Tritons in the 
sixth, eighth and ninth innings added seven 
more runs and eight hits, to make the score 
11-1. 

The Stags tried to make it interesting in 
the bottom of the eighth as they scored two 
runs on a couple of walks and a double, but 

The Tritons face a major tl!St this Saturday 
as they tra~el to Chapman. Chapman, locat-
ed in Orange county, is ranked third in 
Division ll\ baseball If the TritON can Jefeat 
Chapman, this will give them a big boost for 
the rest of the season, and for their push for 
the playoffs.

Lnampionship after a match asainst the 
California institulp. of TechnOlogy and 
Califorr.ia State FLillerton last Saturday. 

The conft:rence title could havt! 
come in hetter fashion as the men's 
tt!am had good but an unimpressive 
performance against Fullerton. 

"We were really close to having a 
sweep of men's events," said Triton fenc-
ing Head Coach Stuart Lee. "Normally 
any other day we would have done it. 
That's a disappointment, but it's the best 
year that UCSD has had by far." 

The Tritons came up short in all three 
squad matches as they lost to Fullerton 
in the foil, epee and sabre competitions 
under very dose drcumstances. 

Despite thE: loss, the Triton men man-

Sports Editor 

Goi'lg into :13 ma,ch on Tuesday 
against Vil\;:nova University, the 
UCSD men's tenni:: team knew it 
would have a tcug~ time agamst a 
tough opponent. It lost to Villanova 
last year, and this year Villan(\va was 
expected to be dS tough as Redlands 
University, who is UC'SD's primary 
rival. 

Th.it is why they play these things. 
When all was said and done, the 

Tritons whitewashed their Division I 
opponents with a score of 6-1. 

In doubl~, the Tritons' play was 
much improved from their perfor-
