Dialogue 
The Muir College Faculty-

Freshman Discussions are fi-
nally underway after months of 
frustration. This program brings 
together Muir College faculty 
members with 3 or 4 students 
each to discuss topics of mutual 
interest in informal weekly sem-
inars. 

Topics run the entire spectrum 
of academic interest, from Math 
5A to Ho Chi Minh, from Psych<f-
analysis to Faulkner. 

These meetings are the work 
of a Professor of AEP, Victor 
Rumsey. The idea started with 
his concern about the negligible I 
contact with the faculty that the 
undergraduates in a large uni-
versity have today. He feels that 
lack was in part responsible for 
the alienation and high failing-
out rate of college students. 

If a student could learntoknow 
a professor as a person, he may 
lose both his fear of asking 
questions and his feeling of iso-
lation from the educational es-
tablishment. 

Professor Rumsey felt that if 
he could convince his fellow un-
derpaid, overworked faculty 
members to work for no pay, he 
would have no problem getting 
student response. 

He was wrong, primarily be-
cause of the abscence of an ef-
fective means of communication 
in the Muir College Community. 
The Muir Convocation, his orig-
inal hope, failed because only a 
few freshmen showed up. 

Last winter, when Prof. Rum-
sey was placed in charge of the 
Muir College Science 2A classes, 
he decided to act on that con-
cern. He replaced TA sections 
with professor sections. The 
switch worked so well that for 
2B he had more faculty volun-
teers than he could use. He , 
estimates that the profs reached 
80 percent of the students in 
this manner rather than the usual 
40 percent. 

The success of that program 
encouraged him to expand it. He 
spent a good part of last summer 
visiting Muir teachers, asking 
each to select four topiCS they 
could discuss without prepara-
tion. 

Still, he considers the progran, 
a successful pilot. The problems 
of time can be worked out in 
years to come. Faculty partici-
pation can be incorporated in 
registration. 

Professor Rumsey hopes that 
other means of bringing the stu-
dents and faculty of Muir to-
gether can be four¥!. Instead of 
a faculty club of the type found 
on most universities, he'd like 
to see a College Community Cen-
ter that welcomes students and 
faculty for coffee, meals, and 
talk. He finds the Coffee Hut 
encouraging in that direction, 
but he'd like to see a place where 
beer is served (like at a British 
university) as part of a com-
mercial plaza on the new John 
Miilr College campus, an idea 
Provost Stewart is working on 
(commercial plaza, that is).

AS,' Prepares for 
Regents Meeting 

A convocation will be held on 
Tuesday, November 19, from 
12:00 to 1:00 p.m. in the Revelle 
Plaza as part of the ASUCSD's 
official preparation for the UC 
Regents' meeting to be held on 
this campus on Thursday and 
Friday, November 21 and 22. 

Faculty speakers will be Dr. 

to avoid that, and the best way"is 
.10 explain to everyone just ex-
actly what is happenin[,,' said 
Shepard. 

He also added, ·We want the 
Regents to understand that we 're 
concerned about the decisions 
they're making. It's important 
that as many students and fac-
ulty as possible get involved so 
that the Regents will really be 
impressed with the number of 
people who are conc~rned. '

Chancellor Explains 
Regents Procedure 

by William J. McGill 
Chancellor of UCSD 

One of the prinCipal ingredi-
ents of the hysteria visible on 
all sides during the October 
meeting of The Regents at Santa 

Cruz, was widespread ignorance 
of how The Regents operate. 
students seemed to believe that 
The Regents discuss problems 
only in a bland, noncommittal way 
during public sessions, and then 
move into executive session to 
make their real decisions. 

This view is quite incorrect. 
At one point during the executive 
session of the Regents' Com-
mittee on Educational Policy a 
group of wildly excited students 
(and others) burst into the meet-
ing room believing that critical 
decisions were being made on 
Social Analysis 139X. The Re-
gents were in fact considering 
the appointment of a Vice Chan-
cellor at San Diego. 

One young lady shouted at the 
Regents, -Why are you meeting 
in secret?" Since at that mo-
ment I was on my feet defend-
ing our appointment, I wanted 
to say, "They do it because 
they are considering the man's 
salary.· I kept my peace. The 
girl would not have believed me 
in any case . 

The Regents of the University 
of California are a public body. 
As with nearly all public bodies 
their meetings have a formal 
structure. Reports of commit-

tees are form ulated and received. 
The President's report is pre-
sented. New business is con-
sidered. These matters are all 
handled via a published agenda 
and substantial matters not on 
the agenda may not be considered 
without due notice (usually one 
month). 

Hence the demand that The 
Regents then and there name 
a college at Santa Cruz -Mal-
colm X College,· presented by a 
group of Santa Cruz students, 
was defective for two reasons. 
First, The Regents do not take 
the initiative in naming campus 
facilities. The campus proposes 
and The. Regents either approve 
or disapprove. This matter had 
not been put on the agenda by 
the Santa Cruz campus. Second, 
The Regents could not act on a 
substantive matter without due 
notice. They took it under ad-
visement which was all they could 
do. 

Angry students then stomped 
out of the meeting. They were 
free to do so but it suggests that 
the student supporters of the 
proposal were more interested 
in sounding off than in getting 
things done. 

Munk, chairman of the San Diego 
Division of the Academic Senate, 
Dr. Baron, San Diego campus re-
presentative to the American As-
sociation of University Profes-
sors, and Dr. Arnold, one of the

faculty committee currently ne-
gotiating with the R~gents con-
cerning the resolution limiting 
guest lecturers to one appear-
ance. 

Muir To Hold 
Righls Meeling 

The full Board of Regents 
meets publicly on the third Fri-
day of each month except in Au-
gust and December. During re-
cent years The Regents have 
visited each campus of the Uni-
versity in this lO-meeting cycle. 
On November 22, they will come 
to UCSD in accord with a meet-
ing schedule published last 
spring. The Friday meeting will 
be preceded by a series of Re-
gents' committee meetings on 
Thursday and by meetings of the 
prinCipa l committees of the Aca-
demic Senate held on the Tues-
day and Wednesday preceding 
The Regents meeting. 

Dr. Munk will speak on what 
the Academic Council, composed ' 
of the chairmen of academic ' 
senate divisions from all the UC 
campuses, is doing to meet the 
challenge of the Regents to fa-
culty autonomy on the Univer-
sity campus. 

Dr. Baron will tell what the 
faculty on the UCSD campus have 
been doing, and Dr. Arnold will 
report on the progress of nego-
tiations with the Regents. 

ASUCSD President Tom She-
pard will also speak to the stu- , 
dents and faculty on what can 
be expected at the Regents ' meet-
ings on Thursday and Friday. 
other speakers will include Har-
old Duncan from SDS, Rick Wil-
liamson, president of Sigma Tau, 
and a speaker from TNC. 

The convocation will be one 
part of an educational program 
sponsored by the AS to inform 
students of what to expect at 
the Regents' meeting and to 
discuss the kinds of action that 
students and faculty have taken 
to date and will take at the meet-
ing. 

President Shepard said that it 
is very important that the stu-
dents on this campus recognize 
what the students at Santa Cruz 
did wrong. 

-They played into the conser-
vative Regents ' hands. We want 

Muir College will hold the 
opening session of its student 
Bill of Rights Convention on Mon-
day, November 18 at 6:00 p.m. 
in Conference Room" A· on Mat-
thews Campus. 

The Convention, in which any 
interested Muir student can par-
ticipate, is the result of a peti-
tion written and circulated by 
the Ad Hoc Committee for Stu-
dent Rights and signed by over 
340 Muir undergraduates. 

By the terms of the petition, 
the Convention must ~onclude by 
November 25, and will be fol-
lowed on December 2 by a refer-
endum by which Muir students 
can ratify or reject the results. 

The petition calls the Conven-
tion a ·a necessary first step 
to a viable alternative to dis-
credited past student govern-
ments' and expresses the hope 
that it might lead eventually to 
a meaningful form of a commun-
ity 
a meaningful form of community 
college government. 

The idea for a Convention grew 
out of student discussion on 
government which were precipi-
tated by th recent decision of 
the Muir College Provisional 
Government to dissolve itself 
and turn over its powers to Ken 
Patric, its former President. 

The m mbers of th group 

which later became the Ad !toe 
Committee for Student Rights 
decided that the perennial prob-
lems of student government-
student apathy and lack of pur-
pose--rnight be overcome by a 
strong Student Bill of Rights 
which would give students the op-
portunity to make truly meaning-
ful decisions affecting their lives 
ar.d would also give any new form 
of government a clear definition 
of function and area of jurisdic-
tion. 

The Ad Hoc Committee is pre-
sently at work on a 12-page Bill 
of Rights which it will present 
to the Convention for consider-
ation. 

Among its more important pro-
visions are sections calling for 
the right of the student community 
to determine its own social rules 
and code of conduct and the right 
to partiCipate directly in the 
formulation and enforcement of 
academic pOlicies and standard 
affecting students, including 
equal repre sentation on college 
committees dealing with these 
subjects. Al 0 inc Iud d is the 
right to specifiC and d tailed 
student regulations free 'rom 
phrases such as -again t the 
best of th univer tty· which 
allow for a wide d gree of 'nter-
pretation. 

Thus the monthly Regents ' 
meeting is a pulse beat that 
organizes the administrative life 
of the University generating con-
tinued policy and new decisions 
with the predictability that public 
bodies come to generate. In 
this way The Regents can make 
long range commitments and yet 
major cr ises can arise at any 
given meeting. We have seen 
much of this pattern of conti-
nuity and perturbation in recent 
years. 

On Thursday morning (Nov. 
21) The Regents Committee on 
Grounds and Buildings will meet 
at 10:00 a.m. This meeting gen-
erally consists of presentations 
by architects on campus projects 
which must be approved by the 
Regents. student regard the 
committee as a very c. ull one. I 
knew that things were confused

~~~------------~ 

People come to the Unlversttyfor many, varied, and debatable reasons. 
One of the generally accepted reasons is that at the University there 

exists a unique atmosphere conducive to, and indeed contrived to 
allow for, the free now and exchange of Ideas and viewpoints and Is 
commonly known as academic freedom. 

At this time when students are demanding a greater share in the 
ability and responsibility to arrange classes, it is of the utmost 
importance to examine student feelings on academic freedom. 

However, academic freedom may not exist at UCSD, not as far as 
the students are concerned. . 

In a recently televised interview, four -representative' UCSD students 
disavowed academic freedom in their reproach of freedom of speech. 

Of the four students, two were characterized as New Lett, one as 
Republican, and one as representative of Black political attitudes. 

The interview was part of an hour long · KEBS program concerning 
Cleaver, Marcuse, and current campus conditions in general. 

The moderator, Pete Kaye, raised the issue of freedom of speech 
in regard to academic freedom when he asked the group if men like 
Cleaver should be heard on campus. The response was affirmative. 

When asked, howe ver , if a man like the late George Lincoln Rockwe 11 
of the American Nazi Party should be allowed to speak, one participant 
voiced a resounding -no' on the grounds that -Rockwell has nothing 
worth hearing.' This 'participant was supported by one of the other 
students while the other two raised no objection. 

One could--and not too unreasonably-imply that the silence of the 
other two was that of tacit consenf: Kaye was visibly shocked by this 
attitude but could draw no more comment. 

So four of four representative UCSD students agreed that a man should 
not be allowed to speak on campus -if he has nothing to say.' 

Dissent? 
One could , in tact, draw up a whole list of those blackballed by the 

strongest campus political group, starting at Lyndon Johnso'l and 
going all the way down to landlords in Logan Heights, and not find one 
who could deliver a 10 minute speech without being Interrupted to 
distraction by those of differing views. That is , if the speaker was 
able to begin. 

Some on campus scream that no one listens to them, that the estab-
lishment is set in its ways and must be overthrown. 

Are these the same people who would nock to hear a Cleaver and 
would not allow a Rockwell a podium? . 

They're so cCinservative, so afraid of whatdiss€!DfersJo their ideal 
of goodness might say, that in a few years, they'll be ideally suited to 
step in and replace the X-wing Establishment with a Y-wing Establish-
ment of their own. One which would be as effective in oppression, 
suppression, and repression as its predecessor. . 

If those who would refuse to hear the other side aren' t paranoid 
Jf dissent then they must feel that -tlle people" must be sheltered 

. from those who would foist monstrously evil plots upon them. This 
would betray a lack of faith In the ability of -the people" to judge for 
themselves and thus suggest an intellectual superiority complex which 
manifests Itself In Irreproachable dogma. 

Don't let anyone--5tudent, professor, or Regent~ell you what to 
believe. Exercise your academic freedom and the responsibility that 
goes with it! No ?ne has nothing to say. 

W hat kind of intellectual pursuit is this? 
. What a perversion of academic freedom! 

prevailing political mood on campus is just as 
by the Governor. 

Dictatorship by the 
unjust as dictatorship 

Guest Editorial YRs: Nixon IS the One 
Richard M. Nixon was the most qualified candidate in the past 

election. Unfortunately, the Congress will remain a reactionary, 
statist body in the pattern of the past thirty-five years. Our contem-
porary problems are the consequences of decades of its "liberal" 
policies. The president-elect must overcome this obstacle. 

Nixon has stated -the first civil right of every American, whether 
he is black Ameri~ or white American ..• is the right to be secure 
from domestic violence.' Since a larger percentage of blacks than 
whites voice concern over the rise In crime, Nixon's position is 
especially important to this minority. 

As to his opposition to civil rights laws, remember that Harry 
Edwards has referred to them as the biggest "nigger" laws in a 
century. These rights are supposed protected by the Constitution. 
No government has the moral right to either grant or deny such rights. 

Concerning poverty, Nlxon has only repudiated proven failures. 
H e has called for tax incentives for companies that would train the 
unskilled and locate new plants in poverty areas--a responsible Re-
publican solution. He also urges new tax exemptions for the poor. 
Furthermore, he supports guaranteed loans enabling the poverty stricken 
to live in their own homes rather than a government slum . 

As for Vietnam Nixon has argued for the de-Americanization of 
the war. He has' said that a final political solution will include all 
parties that renounce the use afforce. He supports President Johnson's 
position at the Paris peace talks. 

Fortunately, Nixon realizes the necessity of maintaining our mlll-
tary superiority. He will strengthen defense pacts such as NATO. 
In light of Czechoslovakia and renewed Soviet threats against West 
Germany this is a vital stand. 

The abolition of the draft-that is one thing Nixon has to offer the 
youth of America. In contrast, Humphrey has called for the estab-
lishment of a lottery of all nineteen year-old males. Incredibly 
enough, Hubert said that -I don't think you can leave it up to individu~is 
is to which wars they want to fight.· To permit draftees to deClde 
which war is moral and which is not would "give a man God-like 
;>owers·(The Denver Post, September 10. 1967). Apparently the Vice 
President is one of the elite few who have such powers. 

To dispel any further doubt, the ultra-conservative New York Times 
(August 29, 1968) said "Nixon is one of the most Intelligent men in 
American politics, with a sharp grasp of an impressive range of 
issues. •

Letter.-
i. eader ~uestions 
Times' Inte llect 
Editor, the Triton Times: 

I feel that your editorial upon 
Richard Nixon, President-elect 

, of the United States, was both 
unjustUied and unsupported. It 
shows the inte llect of the type 
of editor ship that this paper is 
unde rgoing. 

Give the poor fellOW a chance 
to change the country! 

Before he has even taken over 
the reins of office you attack him 
for no reason at all. I suspect 
that the same type of assinine 

I editorial would have followed the 
election of Hubert H. Humphrey 
if it was at all possible. 

I feel that the attitudes that I 
am expresslnc are taken by a 
great many people who have read , 
the editorial and I hope you have 
the couraee and Intestinal forti-
tude to print this. 

Yours truly, 
Michael Hurley

AS Fees~ You 
What You 

Get 
Pay For ... 

by Steve Landau 
Every quarter UCSD undergra-

duates must pay a "student acti-
vity fee" of $6. The AS was 
given the right to levy this fee 
in 1964 when an overwhelming 
majority of the students voted in 
favor of such a fee. A week 
from Monday the students will 
be asked to incorporate this com-
puisory fee Into the AS Consti-
tution in the form of an amend-
ment. 

Naturally the question has been 
raised by many students as to 
just where that $6 goes atter 
they reluctantly part with it. 
Well, that $6 ends up In the hands 
of the elected officers of the 
undergraduate population of 
UCSD, the ASUCSD, and when 
added to the $6 contributed by 
each of the other 2,799 students, 
amounts to some $46,000 over 
the period of a year. 

Quite a sum, $46,000 you might 
say. Well, not really; in fact 
when compared to the "big time" 
up at Calor UCLA,orevenDavis 
or Santa Barbara, it'sonlyadrop 
In the bucket. But the A.S. makes 
the most of it, if tbe vafious 
events it sponsors and organi-
zations it supports are any indi-
cation. 

The major appropriation inthe 
1968-69 A.S budget is made to 
the Program Board. $17,500 has 
been allotted and will be divided 
among four committees: Per-
forming Arts, Lectures, Social 
Events, and Coffee Hut. 

The Lectures committee has 
helped make possible the appear-
ance on campus this quarter of 
Rev. Blaise Bonpane, Eldridge 
Cleaver, and Former Ambassa-
dor Trahn Van Dinh. 

The Social Events committee 
is always on the lookout for big 
name talent, and next week will 
present the heaviest dance-con-
cert in UCSD history, featuring 
top S.F rock group "Quicksilver 
Messenger Service.' The Fla-
min' Groovles, P.A.K., and Hard 
Luck Boy have already been pre-
sented by the AS this quarter. 

The Coffee Hut, completely 
student owned and operated, is 
managed by the AS, which has 
sustained it financially. Week-
end entertainment has featured 

folk and rock acts such as Ma -
terial Stuff Blues Band, SI. Vitus 
dance Band, Three 's Company, 
Sam Hinton, and Rick Dougherty. 
Entertainment costs run about 
$30 Ii night. Wednesday tum 
nights are also financed by the 
AS. 

. The Performini Arts commit-
tee brought the Fireside Thea-
tre to UCSD, and is cooperating 
with the Music and Art Depart-
ments in presentlng events of 
cultural interest to the UCSD 
community. Today they are spon-
soring the appearance of EI Tea-
Iro Campeslno. 

Perhaps the best is yet to 
come, if curre nt plans olthe Pro-
gram Board are any indication. 
Possibilities for the future in-
clude the Paul Butterfield Blues 
Band, Buddy Miles Express, and 
the Ike and Tina Turner Revue. 
A series of symposiums on the 
topic of "The Modern University" 
will commence soon, featuring, 
among others, Dr. Edward Tel-
ler, Dr. Auren Stroll, Dr. Rus-
se Jl Doolittle, Provosts Sallman 
and Rappaport, and Chancellor 
William McGill. Slated for the 
Coffee Hut next quarter is the 
Zorro film series. 

The damn thing is that each of 
these events that the AS pre-
sents for the benefit of the stu-
dents costs money, and numerous 
miscellaneous expenses that the 
students are not aware of mount 
up. These costs include tele-
phone bills, the rental of audio-
visual equipment, the rental of 
security guards at the rate of 
$5 an hour (rent-a-cop), and 
payment for the use of univer-
sity vehicles. 

Of course, advertising is also 
a major expense. The bare 
minimum which would consist 
of merely distributing posters 
around campus, is $15 a shot. 
For larger events , radio spots 
and newspaper ads must be paid 
for. 

The other organization that 
depends largely upon the AS for 
its support is the Communica-
tions Board, which receives ap-
proximately 35% of its income 
from AS appropriations . The 
Communications Board funds the 
recognized campus communica-
tions media: the newspaper, the 

TRITON TIMES; the radio sta· 
tion, KSDT; and the yearbook, 
the TRIDENT, The Board is 
composed of students, faculty, . 
and administrative members ap-
pointed by various campus 
groups. 

The other expense for the AS 
is that of salaries. The student 
affairs office employs an exec-
utive staff of several full time 
secretaries, and the AS contri-
butes to their salaries. They 
coordinate the activities of all 
registered student organizations, 
and take care of most of the 
paper work. Also, several AS 
officers receive salaries: AS 
PreSident, AS ' Vice-President, 
Publicity Chairman, and Student 
Activities Chairman. 

Money was donated last year 
to the Student Center Fund, which 
will be used eventually to bulld 
a student union building. 

Another important AS spon-
sored project is the Student Dir-
ectory, which will list the names 
and addresses, and phone num-
bers of all UCSD undergrads, 
grads, faculty, and administra-
tors. This item available for the 
nominal sum of 25~ will be on 
the stands soon. 

So that's what the AS is doing 
with your $6. Come over to 
the Student Activites office, 
Building 250, Camp Matthews, 
and you'll see that it's no small 
time operation. President She-
pard spends so much time on 
the job that pretty soon he might 
be the best ex-AS prez in the 
army (or Canada). You'll find 
Gary Curtis on the phone trying 
to sign the Stones, or mayhee 
Bob Dylan. Then there's Misti, 

. Rita, and Penny, without whom 
probably nothing would come off 
at all around campus. Then, of 
course, there 's the Trito" Times 
office down the hall where the ed-
itors are busy planning a -Save 
the AS" campaign, since with-
out AS funds they might find 
themselves working for the Cop-
ley Press. 

Anyway, now you know where 
your money is going, so when 
you mark your ballot a week from 
Monday you'll at least be able 
to make an intelligent decision. 
YO'J know now what the AS is 
dOing. Think about it. 

M cGill on Regents, cont. 
at Santa Cruz when 1 found the 
meeting room full. In half an 
hour nearly all the student audi-
ence had left to seek more ex-
citement. 

Grounds and Buildings con-
ducts an executive session gen-
erally for the purpose of ap-
proving architects. The session 
is closed because on occasion 
the identity of firms considered 
but not approved is discussed. 

At 11 a.m . on Thursday The 
Regents' Committee on Educa-
tional Policy meets. Eight of 
The Regents sit on this com-
mlttee , but other Regents may 
attend and participate In the dis-
cussion. 

The matter of Eldridge Clea-
ver and Social Analysis 139X 
tirst came before The Regents 
(in September at Los Angeles) 
in this committee session. The 
committee will in all likelihood 
consider the President's recom-
mendations for liquidating the 
"Cleaver crisis" at the upcomill( 
Regents' meeting. (The agenda 
howeve r is not yet published as 
this article goes to press.) 

Educational Policy also con-
ducts an executive session con-
sidering professorial and admin-
istrative appointments. During 
executive session, all observers 
and all the press are asked to 
vacate the hall. Too session Is 

not conducted until the hall is 
cleared. Executive session of 
the Educational Policy Commit-

te~ will probably be held on 
Thursday afternoon atter The 
Regents break for lunch with 
UCSD faculty. 

Late Thursday afternoon, the 
Committee on Finance meets in 
publJc session. Students I have 
talked to consider this a very 
dull affair though it Involves one 
of the primeval forms of sus-
tenance of the Unlversit},--
money! 

These three Regents' commit-
tees meet on Thursday in se-
quence at the Regents' table. 
The latter seats 26 persons in 
a rectangle with microphones 
set up at each place. Minutes 
of the meetings are kept by the 
Secretary of the Regents and 
t he discussion is recorded on 
tape. Reports of the commit-
les are submitted by their re-
spective chairman during the 
open session of The Regents on 
Friday (11:00 a. m. and again at 
1:45 p.m.). 

Public figures on the Board 
rarely attend the committee ses-
sions on Thursday. The Gover-
nor, the Speaker of the Assem-
bly, and the State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction typicallyar-
rive on Friday plorn1nc (or the 
executive session 01 the full 

Board, preceding the open ses-
sion. 

The executive session deals 
with reports and approvals in-
volving matters discussed in 
executive sessions of The Re-
gents ' committees. The open 
session of the Board generally 
lasts for some 2-3 hours. The 
exchanges reported in the news-
papers occur during this ses-
sion, i.e., on Friday afternoon. 

I want to close by noting that 
I have watched The Regents in 
open session and in executiVE 
session tor more than a year. 
During that time, I have never 
seen them violate tbeir rules of 
procedure. Sensitive matters 
such as SocialAnalysis 139X have 
been discussed only in open ses-
sion. I am impressed with the 
Integrity of The Regents' pro-
cedures and with their evident 
effort to conduct their affairs un-
der public scrutiny. Disruptions 
such as those which occurred at 
Santa Cruz do not create an at -
mosphere In which serious mat-
ters can be discussed seriously. 

I believe we all have a stake 
In keeping The Regents operating 
In the open manner they now fol -
low. Hence we ought to play our 
role as observers In such a way 
as to avoid prejudicing the out-
come against our Interests.

'A.S. Senate Notes 
by Jeff Brittain 

There has been some confusion lately about this column am whether 
or not it is to be taken as objective or subjective reporting. 

It must be made clear that the comments recorded in this column 
constitute the opinion of the reporter as to what goes on, if anyt~g, 
at the meetings of the Senate of the ASSOCiated Students of the UniverSity 

. of California at San Diego. Comments on this column can be forwarded 
to this reporter at Post Otlice Box 4305, La Jolla, or to the Triton 
Times Office, building 250, Matthews Campus. 

At the meeting of 12 November 1968, President Tom Shepard gave 
the following report: 

The 2000 bus tokens have been received from the san Diego Bus 
Company and are now being sold. They can be purchased at the Student 
Affairs Office, 250MC. 

Action has been taken concerning the upcoming Regents' meeting. 
Committees have been formed to publish an AS information sheet to 
inform the students about the meeting. A letter to concerned student 
groups at other UC campuses and the local colleges has been sent 
out to inform those students of the s ituation here and to advise them 
to stay away from the Regents ' meetLng if they are unwilling to abide 
by the programs set up by the AS for that meeting. The policies of 
the AS must be met if the meeting is to be a success for the University, 
Shepard maintained. 

The Regents will meet with the students in the Gym on Wednesday 
at 3:30 p.m. There will be seats for 500 students, on a fir st-come, 
first-serve basis. The fir ::;t priority for seating wlll be for the Asso-
ciated Students of UCSD. 

The committee reports followed that of President Shepard. Jim 
Magill reported on the informat ion sheet about the fee referendum. 
Gary Curtis talked about the new Blake Lounge, where ice cream 
specialties and cokes will be available . The Coffee Hut wlll manage 
this enterprise, which hopefully wUl break even. The hours will be 
from 2:00 p.m. until 1:00 a.m. on weekdays and 7:00 p.m. until 2:00 a. m. 
on weekends. 

The Culinary Co-op report was then given in grand style by Paul 
Ricks. An information sbeet will be put together on the question of 
Instituting a variable meal card plan. 

The Communications Board report followed on the committee agend 
with the announcement that TNC will be using the san Diego Free Press 
justowriters instead of those now used by the Triton Times. The 
problem with otber groups continuing to use these machines still 
exists however. Jan Diepersloot has resigned his Com Board posi-
tion and a new member needs to be appointed, preferably a graduate 
student. 

In conclusion to this stirring list of reports, Trish Cunningham 
reported on the Third College Committees being formed under the 
guidance of Dr. Rappaport. They will be the Honor Code, Oripntation 
and College Government committees . Students are needed for these 
committees and names should be submitted to the proper place . 

On the order oC old business , Paul Ricks' resolution fr om last 
week was defeated after lengthy and perhaps excessive debate. It 
would have added Black Student Council to the list of those who Will 
confer with the Regents next week , but would have also retained Circle K 
and the Young Republicans . The question of what groups are politically 
significant on this campus came up repeatedly. . . . 

The Glider Club was also mentioned as a possible addlhon a long wlth 
the Mexican-American Youth Association. This que stion will be taken up 
at length another time. 

Five faculty members will also be at the - tea " with the Regents 
along with the selected student members and the A.S. Senate on 
Wednesday before the open meeting. 

Senator Biil Eastman's motion for a $75 appropriation to SDS to 
help defray the material costs for their Regents' - meeting campaign 
was passed. . 

Senator Tom Baer introduced a motion to provide $50 for the Indi-
cato r to enable that paper to come out with a l2-page, 4500 copy edition. 
The motion, as passed, guaranteed th t ·the AS will underwrite the 
increase in page-circulat ion of the Ind:::atur. . 

Tr i h Cunningham's motion to provide $226 for each of two electriC 
marquees for the school was passed. Donaiedby Gulf Oil, the marqu~e 
w1ll enable the AS to publicize both its activities and those concermng 
he entire UCSD community. The location of the marquees has yet 

,to bedecided. The money will be used to adapt them fo r the school's use.

teachers of mathematics or sci-
ence, they will be important par-
ticipants In the educational de-
velopment efforts of their host 
countries. During their two year 
sojourn they will have the op-
portunity to earn up to twelve 
semester hours graduate credit. 

The Government of Revelle 
College met again on Tuesday, 
November 22. Dean Ann Con-
klin proposed that the budget 
be discussed first ; the budget 
was later approved at this meet-
ing. 

The purpose of this discussion 
was to review the general areas 
and amounts for expenditure 
which the Sub-Committee on the 
Budget for Vend ing Machine In-
come had proposed. 

The report contained the fol -
lowing allocations: $1,800 , Sa-
laries for student representa-
tives on the Revelle College Go-
vernment; $1,900, student Wages; 
$1,000, Supplies and Expenses;

$1,500 , Student Clubs and Or -

Student Gathe r ings; $750, Art 
Lending Library. 

The budget amounts to $8,850 
and must now be submitted to 
the Ca mpus- Wide Vend ing Mach-
ine Committee. 

The Revelle College Gover n-
ment intends to submit the ir bud-
get to this committee befor e 
it makes its allocations because 
in pr evious years the r eve r se 
proceedure has resulted in the 
money not being available until 
Febr uar y. 

Mr. Allan Blackstock, Revelle 
College Business Mnange r , es-
timated that the board will pro-
bably give Revelle Government 
$6,000 in addition to the $2,200 
left from last year. 

Salaries of $100 per quarter 
for a maximum of three quar-
ters paid to six students wri-

$1800 in the budget, and was 
debated and accepted. It was'

The Draft: Life or Death 

The only thing wrong with David ' 
Harris' discussion of the draft 
last Monday night was that more 
people were not present to hear 
him. For Mr. Harris not only 
condemned the Selective Service 
System as an outrage against the 
individual, but he also went on 
to discuss how American society 
has begun to manipulate and de-
stroy human life rather than 
protect and preserve it. 

Mr. Harris, who is now facing 
a three year jail term for re-
fusing to comply with the draft 
laws , began his presentation by 
examining the society in which 
the present draft system is oper-
ating. He declared that the 
"bloody American presence-
aU over the world is not an 
accident, but rather that it is 
a direct result of the logiC of 
our society. 

Such a social logic, he con-
tends , is based upon the set 
of assumptions which a society 
uses to define its goals and dir-
ection. 

Thus he insisted t hat the pre-
sent election process w11I I)ot 
bring change, because each of 
the new leaders is emeshed In 
the present social logic. What 
is needed, he fee Is, is a new 
social logic. But along with this 
new social logic you must have 
people who are wUling to live 
by it. 

People who will give their lives 
to attacking and destrOying those 
institutions which devalue the 
worth of a human being. Only 
in such a manner will new and 
more viable social and political 
organizations be created. 

One such institution which has 
devalued the worth of a human 
life is the Selective Service Sys-
tem. He characterizes the sys-
tem as one that takes a produc-
tive Individual out of society, 
gives him a gun, and sends him 
half way around the world to 

fight and destroy. 
He goes on to suggest that the 

draft and our social system make 
three assumptions when dealing 
with society. 

The first of these assumptions 
is that the life of a man belongs 
to the State rather than to 
the Individual. Thus a man at 
the age of eighteen Is required 
to spend the next seventeen years 
at the mercy of the government. 
He is further required to carry 
a card which obligates him to 
kill another human being if 
he is so ordered. 

SUch requirements deny aper-
son the right to give direction 
and meaning to his own Ilfe. 
Harris feels that such a den-
ial destroys the purpose of liv-
ing, and that it makes a hollow 
mockery out of the phrase, "de-
mocratic society.· 

The second assumption pointed 
out by Harris is that draft cards 
are used as an educational de-
vice. It educates one to the con-
dition of fear, a condition which 
makes men unable to see the 
world around them. Such men are 
compelled to make decisions on 
the basis of what they fear, 
not what they beUeve in. Thus 
Mr. Harris believes that men 
must be freed from this organized 
policy of fear, a policy which 
is followed by every nation in 
the world. 

The third assumption is one 
which recognizes that 80% of the 
world lives in misery, but which 
seeks to solve this problem with 
the "malled fist- Instead of the 
helping hand. Such a policy is 
followed in Vietnam, where the 
"malled fist- believes that in 

,' order to sava I: vllla(e you must 
destroy It. 

by Clayton Anderson 
This policy dictates that in 

order to save a country, you drop 
high explosives on it; to save 
a person, you kill another per-
son. Thus the question is whether 
you as as individual wish to de-
stroy other individuals, or, as 
Mr. Harris suggests, dedicate 
your life to saving these people. 

The method that lIarrls has 
discovered for saving lives aruJ 
attacking our social system Is 
one of res Isting the draft. U 
you cripple the draft, he believes, 
you cripple the military force s 
which trample on the people of 
the wor ld. He contends that the 
way to cripple the draft is to get 
the draft card carriers , the 
"bricks · of the draft structure , 
to turn in their cards . 

For it is not the Pres ident 
nor General Hershey who give 
validity to the system but the 
people who carry draft cards and 
thus subscribe to the s ystem. 

About two years ago Mr. Harris 
"resigned" from the system, and 
as a result he was given three 
years In a federal penitentiary 
starting next Feburary. The rea-
son that he resigned was that he 
had to decide how he was going 
to live his life. 

He said that he was forced 
to decide what his ideals and 
allegiances were, and that he 
felt he must live by these de-
cisions. 

He chose to reject the alleg-
iance of fear that tie s one to 
the flag or principle of a soc-
iety. Instead he s tates that we 
owe allegiance to the fact of 
people 's lives. 

This belief in the sanctity of 
buman lite Is a person's over-
wbelming concern, and it is tbis 
belief that compels one to re-
ject a draft card which is nothing 
more than a death Warrant for 
another human being. 

Mr. Harris went on to implore 
his audience to see the choice 
between death and life, good and 
evl1, and desructlon and bope 
which is presented to each of 
us. He asks us to assume the role 
criminal which society has con-
ferred upon those who defy the 
law, even when the lax condones 
and supports the "butchery' of 
fellow human beings. 

He went on to state that "all 
you get is what you do·, and that 
if you support the draft in any 
manner you are responsible for 
the consequences. 

Mr. Harris concluded his half 
hour presentation by declaring 
that we must work for the day 
when the words oppresser and 
oppressed have no meaning. They 
will have no meaning because all 
examples of such relationships 
have been destroyed. 

He believes that if we don' t 
attempt to create such a world 
it will never come into exist-
ance. He ended by declaring; 
·you will have company if you 
decide to s tand up. Stand up! 
And not on another man's back". 

At the end of this presenta-
tion he opened the meeting up 
for questions . One 01 the pr i-
mary requests of the overwhelm-
ingly s ympathetic audience was 
for Mr. Harris to elaborate on 
why he wanted to challenge the 
draft. 

Responding to these questions , 
Harris stated that by attacking 
the draft you would be tearing 
away at the forces which have 
created such an Institution. For-
.ces that are not only renected 
10 the system. itself, bIlt also ill •. 
the organization which it sup-

ports, namely the armed ser-
vices. 

For many of the people who 
were in Mr. Harris' audience, 
the need tor changing society, 
and changing It drastically,is de-
monstrated in every aspect of 
American life. 

But the means to sucha change 
is always in question, and it was 
to this problem of effective soc-
Ial action that Mr. Harris made 
his most eloquent plea. 

This plea was for non-violence. 
It was a form of non-violence 
preached by Ghandi, who was a 
believer In the ability of me n to 
be convinced of what was right 
and what was wrong. 

It is a form cif action aimed 
at convinCing people of the right-
eousness of one 's cause, and Mr. 
Harris sees this as the most 
effective policy for changing 
minds rather than des troying 
them. 

He went on to comment that 
the strength of such an approach 
is the people that support it. 
It is people, not technology or 
education, which holds the key 
to changing the social logic. 
People must stop worrying about 
when or how they are going to 
die, but rather turn to the ques-
tion of how they are going to 
live. 

They must direct their lives 
to reaffirming the lives of other , 
and in so dOing they will create 
a concern [or human life through-
out society. 

To tbe suggestion that such 
an approach is idealistic, Harris 
believes that anyone who fee ls 
that the wor ld will survive the 
20th century under the condi-
tions which exist today is being 
idealistic. Harris believes him-
self to be a practical realist, 
a person who recognizes the 
sense less ness and waste that vio-
lence is causing all over the 
world. 

Mr. Harris also makes the 
point that It is easier to shoot 
a policeman than talk to him, 
and that this question of action 
is easily decided when you have 
respect for human life. A per-
son's first response should be 
to "focus in- an opponent, not 
try to eliminate him. He be-
lieves that violence is not in-
stinctive In humans, and that 
people can learn to show their 
respect for themselves by their 
actions towards others . 

During another part of this 
questioning session, Mr . Harris 
made comments on jail life and 
sentence which he faced. He 
stated that if a person had gone 
through 12 years of public school-
Ing, a jail term is no problem 
at all. 

He also believed that he would 
be liable for re-prosecution un-
der the present draft laws at 
the end of his three year term, 
but that he felt that it probably 
wouldn't happen. 

On the question of economic 
sys tems and their organization, 
Harr is believes ttat organization 
and centralization are not the 
same thing. You must always 
have organization, he conte nds , 
but not necessarily centrali-
zation. 

Profit and efficiency s hou Id 
also be modified as cr iter ia for 
economic success , depending on 
what areas you were dea ling 
with. 

Speaking about the prosecution 
of draft protestors , he s tated 
that the delays in prosecution are 
being caused by tbe increased 
number of such cases . He be-
lieves that about thirty cards per 
week are being sent back to 
draft boards both In Los Ang-
eles and San Francisco. Thus 
the movement is ifowlng, and 
It lias brought problems to' FM=-
eral officials.

matrimony with his Jewish sec-
retary. 

The plans are all set; the room 
has been decorated at the temple 
for the wedding. 

He seems doomed to a con-
formist Ufe of Lincoln Conti-
nentals and instant coffee, but 
the taste of a certain potted 
brownie saves Mr. Fine from 
his hopeless fate and leads to 
numerous orgasmic adventures 
among the Venice (L.A.) drop-
outs. Seduced by grass, he and 
his girl friend, played by Leigh 
Taylor- Young, establish rapport 
in his newly psychedellic Lin-
coln. 

Miss Taylor- Young is one of 
the most tantaiizing young belles 
to grace the screen in many a 
moon. What's more, she acts 
magni!1cently too! Her first 
screen performance is a thor-
oughly unexpected combination of 
sex queen and quality actress. 

When scores of hippies invade 
Fine's apartment, and his trip 
turns to a bummer, his sense 
of propriety and order regain 
their influence over his yen to be 
free and he returns to his secre-
tary, his mother, his marriage 
to be, his temple and finally the 
altar. And yet, the prayers of 
stereo cantors cannot seal his 
fate. 

He injects a subtle pathos into 
straight comic material. Ah yes, 
Sir Alec, this is Sellers at his 
dead level best. He makes this 
movie just as he makes Miss 
Leigh Taylor- Young. 

It must be added that the sets 
are as immaculately done as the 
acting. The psychedelicly trans-
formed lawyer's pad is a mar-
velous combination of delightful 
confusion and artistic harmony. 

The colors are of passable 
quality, but most certainly the 
technicolor does not match the 
vibrant hues to be found in a 
Fellini or Antonioni film. Per-
haps Hollywood will catch up to 
Europe one of these days in 
color fidelity. 

Beyond Its abundant hilarity, 
"I Love You, Alice B. Toklas" 
stand up as a first-rate social 
commentary. It aptly chides both 
staid conformism and Hippy-
dropouts alike, and points out that 
freedom remains elusive even to 
the most determined of freedom-
seekers. You will surely be en-
tertained by this movie, now

A mysterious race, with a 
strange language, the Basques 
possess one of the richest and 
most original folklore in the 
world. Once a fierce and war-
like race, the Basques are better 
known today as fishermen, min-
ers and landholders. Yet they 
have resisted assimilation byad-
hering to a unique folk culture, 
different entirely from all others 
and charged with an almost in-
"rpdible vitality. 

The dances occupy a prominent 
place in the program and will 
include from their repertOire the 
Dance of Honor from Aurresku, 
The Dagger Dance, Dance of the 
Basketmakers and the Rounds 
from Leisa. 

Equally impressive is the sing-
ing of the Basques, the distil-
lation of a long and isolated tra-
dition. As much a part ot the 
Basque Festival as its dancers 
and songs are the musictans who 
perform on the traditional Basque 
instruments. 

Following no orthodox program 
format, the Oleata Basque Festi-
val combines all of its dance and

Nobel laureate Dr. Arthur 
Kornberg gave a lecture last 
Friday afternoon in which he 
summarized the progress he and 
his colleagues have made to date 
in their investigations into the 
structure and function of DNA 
Polymerase, the enzyme which is 
held responsible for the replica-
tion of DNA in living organisms. 

He listed a number of proper-
ties which he ascribed to the DNA 
Polymerase. The most novel and 
significant of these properties 
was the newly discovered ability 
of the polymerase to actually di-
gest a single strand of the double 
stranded DNA in the 5' to 3' 
direction while the enzyme si-
multaneously tacks on 5' nucleo-
tide tri-phospates by facilitated 
nucleophilic attack by the free 
3' hydroxy terminus. 

Dr. Kornberg discussed an ex-
periment which provided the bas-
is for the description of the 3' 
hydroxyl group as a primer to 
further growt h. In the exper iment 
ddTTp (which has an 'H' group 
instead of an 'OH' at the 3' 
position) is added in large a-
mounts while a sample of nicked 
plasmid DNA is undergoing rep-
lication in conjunction with the 
presence of DNA polymerase. 
Invariably, the replication ended 

music into a dramatic whole, a 
pageant that reveal the lite of the 
Basques in its varied aspects-
the continuous flow of action in 
dance, song and music.

with the utilization of one of the 
radioactively tagged ddTTp's. 

ThUS, it seems that the 3' 
hydroxyl group is quite vital to 
the continued progression of the 
DNA polymerase up the double 
helical molecule. 

In regard to the physical prop-
erties of DNA polymerase, Dr. 
Kornberg's comments were few 
and far between. He did mention 
that the enzyme has a molecular 
weight of 109,000, and that it is 
a single polypeptide chain. The 
evidence for this later statement 
involved subjecting the purified 
polymerase to quite severe ex-
posure of acid, alkali, and urea. 
In all cases, the exposed enzyme 
sedimented as a single polypep-
tide chain. 

Only one sul!hydral and one 
S-S group have been found as 
side groups on the molecule. The 
sulfhydral group does not appear 
to be involved in the process of 
DNA replication as complexing 
(and labelling) this sub-unit with 
mercury does not visibly affect 
the enzyme's catalytic, polymer-
izing abilities. No other specific 
chemical structures were men-
tioned. 

Dr. Kornberg did disclose de-
tails of an investigation which 
has shown the eXistence of only 
one binding site for all four 
nucleoside tri-phosphates. Bas-
ically, the experiment consisted 
of single and multiple site prob-
ability analyses of preferential 
binding information as regards 
the four nucleoside tri-phos-
phates, Atp, Ttp, Ctp, and Gtp. 
It turns ou that only t he one 
site analyses resu lt in linear 
extrapolations to one at plus 
infinity. 

The forked junction mode of 
DNA replication was reaffirmed 
by Dr. Kornberg in his lecture. 
Here, the polymerase tirst pro-
ceeds up one strand 3' to 5', 
then switches strands, goes up 
the oppositely polarized strand 
in the opposite direction (but 
still 3' to 5' ) until it reaches 
the end, where it drops off for 
a while. Ligase joins up the fork 
segments, when the polymerase 
has returned to the end of the 
newly synthesized strand and 
cranked out another fork . 

There are a number of diffi-
culties with this model which 
still remain to be worked out. 
One of these, readily acknow-
ledged by Dr. Kornberg, is that 
perfectly un-nicked double 
stranded circular DNA is com-
pletely immune to DNA polym-
erase action. If this is true, 
how is it that, say, E. Coli DNA 
(which is circular and double 
stranded) ever gets replicated? 
Clearly, as the theory now stands, 
a nick-producing agent is re-
quired for successful replication 
of such D A. 

Dr. Kornberg was crisp and 
neat in his delivery, and came 
well-equipped with slides and 
blackboard drawings. The lec-
ture as a whole was mostly re-
view, with a few little gems of 
'new ' information. Again, the 
most significant fact re leased by 
Kornberg was the degrading a-
bility of the enz?me DNA poly-
merase.

feels that historical economics 
has been a major focus of social 
criticism and change. He also 
feels that this economics has a 
basic effect upon the discussion 
of various alternative economic 
syste ms , and that its conslusions 
cannot be ignored without study. 

And, moreover, Dr, Orr does 
not feel that economics in any 
form should abdicate its critical 
power. 

Both Dr. Orr, and 80S have 
maintained a reasoned atmos-
phere, except for a few intense 
moments. The arguments have 
basically been quite rational, 
without any sort of personal or 
dogmatic vendetta. There is no 
doubt that both sides of the de-
bate have gained fro .... the dis-
cussion. 

Today for the first time, SOS 
has presented a truly authOra-
tative pamphlet. Previously, Dr. 
Orr has been able to show their 
arguments and sourses to be of 
questionable quality, . by ex-
tensively quoting figures. Yet 
this last article, for the first 
time will force Dr. Orr to dir-
ectly face a heavy battery of 
opinion from recognized sources. 

The true possible benificlaries 
of the debate are of course the 
students. Although little enthu-
siasm has been shown by the 
class as a whole, this is the 
first time this author has wit-
nessed a major disagreement on 
an authoritative level in a class. 
The learning possibilities are 
without measure. 

The dialogue has also saved 
this clas s. Economics I-A is 
basically the learning by route 
of certain basic rules of m icro-
economic theory. This is ex-
tremely boring, and this dialogue 
is all that has enlivened the 
class. 

SOS is to be commended for 
raising these questions. Even 
II Dr. Orr can disclaim them, 
their importance to American and 
world his tory and contemporary 
problems makes their discuss ion 
imperative. 

To a large extent, I he class

Most surely, this crit icis m of

that in the future more udents 
will become Involved with an 
analysis of their own classes. 
It is further hoped that profes-

Dear Editor: 
In tbe November 6 of tbe In-

dicator students and, I presume, 
faculty of UCSD are urged to 
support the inclusion of Black 
Studies in the Humanities Se-
quence. It Is a good and timely 
suggestion which deserves full 
support. However, why do you 
urge Black Studies only? 

Are tbe Black people the only 
oppressed minority in this coun-
try? What of the American in-
dians and Chicanos? Do they 
not have very substantial cUl-
tures of their own? 

The exclusive stress on Black 
studies appears as a further in-
stance of discrimination against 
these already oppressed Amerin-
dian and Chicano minority 
groups. Why should such dis -
crimination be allowed? Why 
not have not only Black Studies 
but Amerindian, Chicano.aJlll 
Black Studies in the Humanities 
sequence? 

The format ot Humanities 
courses in Chicano, Amerindian 
and Black studies needs working 
out. One suggestion is to re-
duce the present 6-course se-
quence in Western Civilization 
to 5 and to reserve the 6th 
course to Minorities Studies. 

This 6th course could be di-
tided into sections of Black, 
4.merindian and Chlcano Studies 
which would be given simultan-

~ously every academic year. 
Within the limitations of maxi-
mum enrollment of each section, 
students would be free to choose 
among these three options. 

Political pressure, which is 
undeniably at work, and political 
expediency, which maybe a temp-
ting half measure, s hould not 
be allowed to interpose with this 
needed tripartite readdress of 
cultural and social justice. We 
can do it. 

I do know that some of my 
colleagues, among the Humani-
ties professor s, are willing to 
instruct in all three options of 
Minorities Studies. Personally, 
] am willing to prepare and to 
give instruction in Chicano stu-
dies. 

Moreover, our students should 
be given free choice to decide 
which ot the three alternat ives 
they wish to take. They are 
entitled to such a cboice. 

Thus, I urge you to amend ' 
your recommendation to include 
Amerindian, Chicano and Black 
Studies in the Humanities Se-
quence. 

Sincerely yours, 
Piero Ariotti

Reagan's Resolution 
(Editor's Note; The following by The Regents is limited 
is the text of the controversial that Regental approval is neces -
rAsolution proposed by Go'/ernor sary before degrees can be awar-

Ronald Reagan at the last meeting ded. 
of the Board of Regents. It is (5) That the power to make 
printed here in order to give faculty appolntm~ is not now 
tbe reader some idea of the im- aoo never has been delegated to 
porlance of next week's meetlng, the faculty, but instead remains 
to be beld here at UCSD. The wil.ll Tbe Regents, the P.resident, 
discussion of this resolution is and the Chancellors. 
also included, reprlnted from .-
the official Regent Minutes.) 

WHEREAS, The People of Cal-
ifornia, ill Article IX Sec. 9 of 
the California Constitution, have 
invested The Regents with full 
powers to organize and govern 
the University of CallIornia; and 

WHEREAS, The CQnstitulian 
autho izes but dolls not require 
Tbe Regents to dele te to the 
fa ul y sUcfi authoTl y or func-
tions a s The Regents deem wise; 
~fi(1 

HEREAS, The Regents are 
' empowered by law to withdraw 
any delegated authority or func-
tions which The Regents deem to 
have been exercised unwisely by 
the faculty; and 

WHEREAS, The Resolution 
adopted by the Berkeley Divi-
sion of the Academic Senate on 
October 3, 1968, evidences many 
misconceptions regarding the au-
thority and functions delegated 
by The Regents to the Academic 
Senate; and 

WHEREAS, It is necessary that 
these misconceptions be correc-
ted in order that the people of 
California may be reassured tbat 
The Regents are exercising and 
intend in the future to exercise 
their power to govern the Uni-
'Versity; 

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RE-
SOLVED 

(I) That the Aca ic Senate 
has no autonomous power to or-
gan e or govern fbe University 
because such power resides , by 
law, exclusively in The Regents. 

(2) That the power to author-
ize and supervise the courses 
delegated to the faculty by Tbe 
Regents IS limited to the speci-
fic delegations made. 

(3) That the Board of Educa-
tional Development is not and 
never as been delegated power 
to initiat course~ . 

This resolution, although not 
intended to be retroactive in 
its effect, Is effective immediate-
ly. 

(4) T t the power to deter-
mine conditions for the award of 
<Jegees delee ted to tile faculty. 

This s tatement should not . be 
interpreted as an attempt to in-
terfere with the long standing 
custom wherein the determina-
tion of wbo teaches courses is 
considered a joint responsibil-
ity of the 'Academic Senate and 
the adm inistration. 

The following statement made 
by President Hitch at the Octo-
ber 3 meeting of the Berkeley 
Division of the Academic Senate 
covers this point; 

-I sense some confusion in 
discussions of The Regents ' 
first resolution between the 
Senate 's authorit y over theap-
pro val of courses, and the de-
termination of who teaches 
course s, which has long been 
recognized as a joint responsi-
bility of the Senate and the ad-
ministration. I think it is sig-
nificant that not a single Re-
gent challenged the validity of 
a course with the subject mat-
ter of 139X. Their action was 
directed at the question oC the 
appropriate role of persons 
without a Univer sity appoint-
ment in the teaching of cour-
ses. -

(6) That exerc ise of the power 
to scrutinize and approve ap-
pointments is separate and dis-
tinct from questions of academic 
freedom and free speech. The 
Regents note with approval in 
this connection the following 
statement from University Regu-
lation 5; 

• Essentially the freedom of a 
Univer sity is the freedom of 
competent persons in the 
classroom. In order to pro-
tect this freedom, the Univer-
sity assumes the right to pre-
vent exploitation of its pres-
tige by unquallIied persons or 
by those who would use it as a 
platform for propaganda. It 
therefore takes great care in 
the appointment of its teachers; 
it must take correspond ing 
care with respect to otbprs 
who wish to speak in its name. 

(7) That The Regents intended 
by their action on September 20 , 
]968, and now reiterate that no 
University facllities s hall be used 
for a program of instruction 
following the substance of Socia I 
Analysis 139X, whether lor credit 
or not, in which Mr. Cleaver ap-
pears more than once as a lec-
turer. 

(8) Any faculty member who, 
by any form of st rategem or 
subterfuge, accredits work in 
Soclal Analysis 139X in VIOlation 
of Regental rulings shall be sub-
ject to disclplinary action and 
any units of credit so received 
by students enrolled in the course 
sha ll not be counted for degree 
purposes, nor shall students in 
Social Analysis 139X be allowed 
to graduate with I S5 than the 
normal number of credit units 
required for degre purpose. 

Th Gove rnor's motion wa 
seconded. 

Regent Simon ral ed a point 
ot order, stating that he did not 
believe the motion was properly 
belore the Board and that he 
felt that the contellt ot tbe pro-
posed resolution countermands 
many of The Regents' Standing 
Orders. The Governor chall~nged 

the point of order on the basis 
that, In his opinion, the proposed 
resolution only re-aUirms the 
Board' s September 20 action. 

On the point of order, General 
Counsel advised that, based on 
the wording of the item on the 
agenda and the fact that the Gov-
ernor 's resolution reters to the 
resolution adopted by the Berke-
ley Division ofthe Academic Sen-
ate, consideration of and a vote 
on the Governor's motion was 
in order. The Chairman there-
upon ruled the Govern or's motion 
to be in order. 

Although he agreed with the 
content of the Governor's resolu-
tion, Regent Canaday appealed 
from the ruling of the Chair 
on the gr ound that The Regents 
had just voted to defer any fur-
ther consideration of this matte r 
until the November meeting. Re-
gent Coblentz joined Regent Ca-
naday in hIS appeal from the 
Chair's ruling. 

The President concurred with 
Regent Canaday's contention that 
the Governor's resolution is con-
trar y to the intent of the action 
just taken by The Regents. Fur-
ther, he did not believe that the 
resolution was a restatement of 
the September 20 action, pointing 
out in particular th2.t item (7) 
therein constitutes a modiIication 
of that action. It was his opin- . 
ion that adoption of the proposed 
resolution at this time would have 
drastlc consequences for the Uni-
versity. 

The Governor stated that in 
his opinion The Regents' action 
of September 20 limited Mr. 
Cleaver to one appearance bto-
fore the class. He pointed out 
that the class is continuing to 
meet, although without credit; 
that Mr. Cleaver has appeared 
before it more than once, and 
that the course has not been 
restructured to conform to what 
he felt was the intent of Tbe 
Regents' action of Sep ember 20. 
To him this was in violation of 
that intent and was a challenge 
to The Regents' duly constituted 
responsibility to govern the edu-
cational policy of the Umversity. 

The Pre~ident stated that the 
entire thrust of his remarks in 
introducing the resolutions at the 
last meeting was to protect the 
academic integrity of University 
courses for c red it. He also 
felt it was made very clear at 
that time that The Regents' ac-
tion applied only to University 
courses for which credit is given. 

Regent Canaday's appeal from 
the ruling of the Chair was then 
put to a vote, and the appeal 
was upheld; Regents Boyd, Brett, 
Canaday, Carter , Coblentz, Dut-
ton, Forbes, Heller, Hitch, Paul-
ey, Pettitt, Roth and Simon vot-
ing "Aye;" Regents Campbe II, 
Finch, Grant, Haldeman, Hearst , 
Raffert y, Reagan and Unruh vot-
ing ·'No.' Regent Higgs did 
not vote.

NCAA vs. AAU: An 
Argument 'or Union 

by La.rry RafUI 
With the electlon now over, 

and Richard Nixon being con-
ceded the presidency, many 
splinter groups in the United 
States are looking to see what 
he will do specifically for them. 
Doctors ·want one thing, lawyers 
want something else, and Indian 
chiefs want something different 
from the other two. 

I asked myself. *Whatdo sports 
columnists ·want? Are there any 
real problems In the world of 
sports that need the attention 
of the President of the U.S?" 

The President has never had 
a real place In sports, except 
for throwing out the fir~t ball 
of the baseball season_ From 
there, sports goes it's · own way 
and the President goes back to 
solving the world's problems. 

Nevertheless, there Is a very 
real and important problem that 
can and should be solved by the 
President. I am speaking of 
the long standIng feud between the 
National Collegiate Athletic As-
sociation (NCAA) and the Ama-
teur Athletic Union (AA U), which 
makes the feud between the Hat-
fields and McCoys look like a 
love spat. 

Although the goals of these 
two groups are similar, they con-
tlnue to stay separate and this 
separation has hurt the athletes of 
the U.S. and athletes olthe world. 

The problem seems to be the 
lack of a kunion" for athletes 
and the need for one, and only 
one, governing body to control 
rules and records of U.S. ath-
letes. 

Unfortunately, the leaders of 
the NCAA and the AAU have acted 
Immaturely by refusing to sit 
down and discuss this proble m. 
Each Is stUbborn and unwilling to 
make the first move and give In 
a little. 

But just one *union- is des-
perately needed. NCAA athletes 
(who are from colleges and uni .. 
versltles of the U.S.) are not 
allowed to participate In AAl' 

No matter 

sponsored events. Likewise, 
AAU athletes (all the other ath-
letes not In the NCAA, e.g. -
amateurs out of college, non-
college athletes, etc.) wUi not 
go to NCAA meets for fear of 
castigation from the AAU. 

There is no reason for some 
of the incidents that have resulted 
from this feud. For Instnace, . 
the AAU refuses to recognize Jim 
Ryun's world record In the mUe 
because he Is In the NCAA. Ev-
eryone knows Jim Ryun holds the 
world record In the mile, and it 
seems stupid for the AAU not to 
recognize this fine athlete. 

So what can Mr. Nixon, as 
President, do to patch up this 
feud and help athletes of our 
country? As socialistic or as 
anarchistic as it may sound, I 
believe Nixon should step In and 
stop the feud, and have a sub-
committee in Congress investi-
gate the problem and, if neces-
sary, act as a mediator to merge 
the NCAA and the AAU. 

This merge would be the best 
thing to happen to American ath-
letes since the Invention of the 
track shoe. It would be the U.S. 
representative In the world wide 
governing body of athletics, the 
International Athletic Union. It 
would review and accept new 
records in all events, and pass 
judgments on all new equipment, 
such as the new brush-spike 
track shoe. 

It would sponsor all athletic 
meets and Intercollegiate sports, 
and would provide a means of 
bringing together the best ath-
letes of the U.S., thus giving 
athletes a chance to compete 
against other athletes, regard-
less of affiliation, in the same 
event. 

I realize that Mr. Nixon has 
more important problems to 
solve. But if and when he has 
a chance, it would be good for 
everyone if he could start the 
wheels rolling towards one ·un-
ion" for all U.S. athletes.

Triton H.rr/.rs 
Los. Close One 

The UCSD cross country team 
dropped a close meet against 
cross-town rival Cal Western 
at Cal Western last Saturday. 

The score was 25-30 (low score 
wins), in by far the closest meet 
of the season. Cal Western run-
ners finished first, third, fifth, 
seventh and ninth for a team 
total of 25. Westerner Ken An-
derson won the meet with a 
21:23 time for the 4-mlle course. 

Jay Segal, Joe Gonzales, Jay 
Gillette, Randy Twombly and Art 
Lujan finished second, fourth, 
sixth, eighth and tenth, respec-
tively, for the Tritons. 

The time between the first and 
fifth finishers for the Tritons was 
2: 14, an improvement In an area 
the team has been working on. 

Triton Jay Segal led the race 
for the first three miles before 
being overtaken by Anderson. 
Joe Gonzales continues to Im-
pr!'ve, and will probably be at 
peak condition In about a week. 
Randy Twombly displayed a tre-
mendous final sprint to hold off 
Hake of Cal Western, who won the 
meet last year. 

The team is looking forward to 
the return of Clark Rosen this 
week, Rosen has been out with 
mononucleosis. 

The next cross country meet 
is the N AlA conference district 
meet at Mt. San Anionio Junior 
College. Approximately 15 col-
leges will be represented on the 
hilly five-mile course.

Tritons Get 31;. 
Cal Tech Wins 

by Dave Warburton 
The Triton football team met 

the fired up Beavers of Cal Tech 
on Saturday In Pasadena. Des-
pite a fine offensive showing by 
the Tritons Cal Tech was able 
to win 34-31. 

The man who did the most 
for Cal Tech was senior quarter-
back Tom Burton. He ran for 
65 yards himself and passed for 
150 more. He completed 14 
of the 23 passes he attempted 
with two Interceptions. 

Burton scored two touchdowns, 
kicked four extra points, kicked 
off and punted for the Beavers. 
He also intercepted a pass. Bur-
ton's favorite target was end 
Lonnie Martin who gained 123 
yards on pass receptions. Both 
Burton and Martin are two-time 
all-league selections. 

Cal Tech scored first as Burton 
carried the baU over from a 
half yard out. He kicked the 
extra point to make it 7-0. 

In the second quarter the Tri-
tons came back. starting from 
their own 22 the Tritons got 
runs of 23 yards by Belton Flour-
noy and 16 yards by Steve Gar-
folo. 

Greg Gleason passed to John 
Ringwood for another 12 yards. 
Then Flournoy carried five times 
to move the ball to the Beaver 
three. Gleason carried it over 
and Randy Herman kicked the 
extra point to make 7-7. 

After the kickoff, Cal Tech 
fumbled a pitch-out and Bob Dosh 
fell on the ball for the Tritons. 
Manuel Myers carried 13 yards 
for the Triton touch down. 

The kick fa iled, and Cal Tech 
got the ball on the kickoff and 
drove for a touchdown. Four 
passes from Burton to Martin 
put the Beavers on the two yard 
line from where Mike Brannan 
carried it in for the touchdown. 
Burton kicked the extra point to 
make it 14-13. 

The Beavers then recovered 
a Triton fumble and Brannan 
scored from 11 yards out. Burton 
converted to make it 21-13. 

The Tritons then marched 71 
yards with Garfolo scoring on 

~JJ 

a run of eight yards. The at-
tempted two - point conversion 
failed. 

The half ended with the score 
21-19. 

Following a- Triton fumble the 
Beavers again started a drive. 
With the Beavers on the Triton 
32 yard l!ne Chris Braeunig 
dumped Burton as he was passing. 
This was the only time the Tri-
ton defense was able to touch 
Burton. 

The Beavers took the ball to 
the Triton five before the de-
fense stopped them. Shortly 
thereafter Burton brought the 
Beavers back again and scored 
himself. He missed the extra 
point and the score remained 
27-19. 

In the fourth Quarter the Tri-
tons scored again on a Gleason 
to Mike Heredia pass good for 
15 yards. An attempted run for 
the two-point conversion failed. 

However, the Beavers were not 
to be denied for long. Burton 
Intercepted on the Triton 22 and 
Brannen scored his third touch-
down three plays later. Burton 
kicked his fourth extra point 
to make It 34-25. 

On the kickoff Mike Griffith 
knocked down a low kickoff by 
Burton and fell on the ball at 
the UC 46. Gleason then com-
pleted passes to Ringwood, 
Flournoy and two to Dan Mikels, 
the final one for a touchdown. 

The Triton offensive unit 
played its best game of the year. 
Greg Gleason was given good 
protection most of the game and 
the running backs had some holes 
opened for them. Playing off-
ensive line for the Tritons were 
Alan Dwyer, Howard Nathanson, 
Chris Braeunig, Ed Couvrette 
and Bob Doyle, with relief pro-
vided by Bill Faddis, Bob Dosh 
and Chris Jorgensen. 

It the Tritons can put together 
the offense they demonstrated a-
gainst Cal Tech with the defense 
they showed against Cal Western 
they will give their remaining 
opponents a rough time.

WANT TO "TRANSFORM SAN ' 
Diego into a thoroughly decent 
place!' ? Nothing less than that 
is the goal ot a group, headed 
by 2 (black) ministers and a 
Cal Western law student. Last · 
June, after Dr. King and Senator 
Kennedy were shot, the three 
(Revs. George and Jesse Mc-
Kinney and Bob Coates) decided 
they had to act. 

They looked about and noti-
ced that, all over this town, 
t here was (is) a great need for 
simple physical work (painting, 
planting, digging, hammering --
building). 

They felt that if people trom 
currently alienated groupings 
could be brought together in the 
egalitarian setting of simple 
"barn raising" work tor the bet-
terment of the community --
not only would there be tangible, 
physical impr ovements, but per-
ahps men (and women, and stu-
dents, and ... ) could come to 
understand each other better ... 
and be able to see and seek lar-
ger and wider solutions to com-
munity (and national?) problems. 

They have persevered. And 
they invite all of us to lend a 
hand. Those interested should 
s how up at 5825 Imperial Ave. 
any Saturday around 10: 00 am 
with hammers, shovels, friends, 
and a smile ... call 262-0421. 
(If you can' t call ahead, just 
come ahead). 

Work sites include: a Neigh-
borhood House, a thrift shop, a 
Youth Authority parolee Half-
way House, a church and com-
munity center, a boy's club , 
and a park.
