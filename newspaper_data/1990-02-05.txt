Greenfield Discusses 
Media And Politics 
By ANDREA ADLEMAN 
Sell/or Staff Writer 

BC News correspondent Jeff 
Greenfield addressed an audience 
of over400 people here on the sub-
ject of politic and the media Fri-
day night. 

Greenfield ' s 45-minute speech 
focused on the media' influence 
on pOlitics. According to Green-
field. the media has ales er impact 
than social scientists, academic , 
and other commonly believe. 

He bases his "minority view" 
on the premise that popular belief 
about media power are "substan-
tially wrong or at least wildly 
over tated, and in some cases flatl y 
contradicted by the evidence and 
in orne cases directly elf-contra-
dict tng. " 

dollop or two of common . en e 
.. . you ee that a lot of time , (he 
assertion of television' power 
blinds u to much more pervasive 
factors in American life." 

As a political and media ana-
lyst, Greenfield, 45, has spent many 
years examining the relation hip 
between the merican public, 
politics, and the media. Having 
served as a speechwriter for for-
mer New York Mayor John Lind-
say and the late Senator Robert 
Kennedy, Greenfield has experi-
enced politics as an in ider. 

One subject Greenfield ad-
dressed was the theory that a uc-
cessful U.S. pre ident mu t be a 
"television pre ident."

media' power can be traced to 
social trends during the early years 
of television. 

"Televi ion came into Ameri-

end of World War II, and that was 
a time when the U.S. was going

ASUCLA Bans Tobacco Use And 
Sales In Most Student Facilities 

Both smoking and sales of tobacco products will be 
banned in all UCLA student association facilities in 
M arch, the ASUCLA Board of Directors decided late 
last month. 

Smoking will continue to be allowed on patios outside 
of some ASUCLA faci lities, but the ban will be enforced 
indoors after M arch 23, the last day of final exams. 

Tobacco products. including cigarettes, cigars, chew-
ing tobacco, and nuff will no longer be sold beginning 
March 3. 

The propo al for the smoking ban was oppo ed at an 
ASUCLA meeting by two students who argued that it 
would adversely affect smokers during cold or rainy 
weather and high stress times such as final exam periods.

While some board members rai ed the question of

smokers who will not comply with the ban, o thers 
argued that enforcement hasn' t been a problem in Uni-

UCSB Demotes 'futorial Director 
Due To Internal Audit Allegations 

Former UCSB Tutorial Center Director James Tepfer 
was demoted at the beginning of this year after an 
internal audit of the center revealed misappropriation of 
University resources and other mi managemenl. 

Since the demotion, T epfer has held the position of 
coordinator of special and drop-in tutorials, according to 
UCS8's A istant Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Ernest Zomalt, who ha taken direct control of the center 
since the audit was released. 

Tepfer will also receive a cut in salary from $54,2 13 
to $44,900, according to Public Information Office Di-
rector Margaret Weeks. 

The internal audit, released in early July, said Tepfer 
and other members of the staff made more than $ 1 ,400 in 
personal toll call from campus telephones. 

Zomalt said he believed the staff members mentioned 
in the audit had reimbur ed the Univers ity for the money, 
but was not certain . 

The audit also di closed "a long-term staffing pattern 
which has resulted in an administrative staff composed 
almost entirely of employees who appear to be affiliated 
with an off-campus spiritual/philosophical organization." 

The purchase of nearly $17,000 of computer equip-
ment and software from a company partially owned by a 
Tutorial Center employee was also questioned in the 
audit. 

Tepfer has said he disagrees with the audit' s findings 
but will not pursue the matter further. 

"I do not propose to initiate any legal action or persist 
in futile polemics," Tepfer said in a written statement to 
the Daily Nex us. 

"Such dissention cannot conduce to the moral health 
or future welfare of our campus community," he said. 

In late July, Zomalt sent confidential memos to four 
tutorial staff members who were criticized in the audit, 
outlining what recourse he would take in response to it. 

Although Zomalt originally said he would announce 
his intended disciplinary actions by Sept. 18, the deci-
sions did not come until early December, according to 
Tutorial Coordinator Manoutcher Eskandari -Qajar. 

The delay was " in orderto afford [Tepfer] due process 
under the review provisions under personnel policy," 
Zomalt said. 

Zomalt confi rmed that Tutorial Center Academic 
Coordinator Tom Brooks, one of the other employees 
mentioned in the audit, received a two-week suspe nsion 
without pay.

MEDIA: ABC News' Greenfield Speaks 
Continued from page l 
,Ible system of apartheid, if people 
are gene rall y feeling more or less 
okay, IS it possible that that is why 
Ill.:y elect the preSident ns opposed 
'0 how he appear~ on television?" 

Greenfield attributes the con-
tinued success of the Republicans 
in winlllng the presidency to this 
"general perception that things are 
okay." 

He exp lained that after Ronald 
Reagan was re-elected to the presi-
dency, "Bush got a line off in hb 
acceptance speech that Reagan ap-
parent ly thought was the si ngle 
best definition of thei r wholec.U11-
paign: s ince we have to c hange 
horses anyway, doesn't it make 
sense to pick the horse that's go ing 
the same way? 

" Jf you ' re going to make that 
argument and your opponent can ' t 
oherentl y make the other argu-

ment. why would voters change? 
This is ca lled poli tics . This is called 
public discourse." 

According to Greenfield, some 
public di scourse ascribes to telev i-
sion "changes in the American 
political 5ystem that in fact aren ' t 
change at all, but adaptations." 

He said that emphasis on the 
symbolic over the sub tant ive has 
been a factor in politics si nce 
Abraham Lincoln was portrayed 
as an average railroad builder. In 
add ition, he aid that negative 
campaigning and attention to a 
candidate' s appearance are long-
stand ing tradi tions in American 
politics. 

"People . ometimes think there 
were no scandals before the age of 
television. I realize that nobody 
takes hi tory anymore, but does 
the word Teapot Dome ring a bell?" 
asked Greenfield, referring to the 
oil scandal in the Warren G. Har-
ding administration. 

Greenfield 's lec tu re was fol -
lowed by an extensive question-
and-answer period, during which 
he commented on political issues 
ranging from abortion to Eastern 
Europe to Panama. 

When asked about Jesse 
Jackson, Greenfield speculated that 
Jackson "won ' t run for mayor of 
Washington, D.C. unless he abso-
lutely feels he has to." He pre-
dicted that Jackson will seek the 
Democratic nomination for presi -
dent in 1992, and " this time, when 
he comes in second to the eventual 
winner, i,ewill say, ' Now you must 
give me the vice presidency.' .. 

Referring to the frequent jokes 
about Vice Pre ident Dan Quayle, 
Greenfield said that "here is where 
television does have a particular 
political impact."

Silliness in the A.S. 

Our Representatives? 
Eve!") year. at the beginning of Winter Quat1er, people start 

point ing out that the Asso iated Student Council is wo r 'e than in 
pa~[ year , and, in fact, i ~ the \IIorst we ' ve ever had. Without 
jumping on that ridiculous bandwagon , it i true that thi , year ' 
A.S. has been plagued with some rea l problems. The problem 
uren 't due to incompetence. In fact, they ' re largely just laughabl y 
si lly - or would be, if they weren ' t so important. 

The A.S. has yet to take a position on the "Fighting Words" 
policy in tituted by UC President David Gardner. This alone 
make the Council negligent , since the policy i ' month old. But 
to make mailers worse, there i a trong po sibility that the A.S. 
will s upport the po/i( y. 

You read that right. The A. ., supposedly the repre entative of 
the student , is like ly to fa il to upport the students' most bas ic 
right : freedom of speech. The policy, which punishes students 
who use words "l ikely to provoke a violence response," is at odds 
with everyth ing a univers ity tands for: 
free di course, di cussion of contrO-A 

:ersia~ issues far from the emotional-
Ism of the outSide \\ orlJ . and the cool 
reason of acudemw . 

The supporters ot the poltc~ argut! § 
that It enhances th l~ atmo phere b~ 
removlllg "verbal abu~e ." rtddtng dl~ 
course of poisoned word . Bur this 0 
polic} has a chi ll ing effect: c\ eryonc 
must hesitate before propound lllg any Idea, for lear the) \~ ill be 
charged with utte ring a ph rase " likely to provoke a \ lo lent 
respome." 

The only thing that has held the Council back from ~upport sO 
far is worrie . about who decides what fighting words are. But 
A.S. President John Ramirez said that if he were sure ~tudents 
would maJ..e the deCision , he would ha e no problem with the 
poli cy, 

A proposal to support the policy was introduced in Council last 
Wednesday, but was wi thdrawn when it was crtticized for not 
addressing the problem in the implementati on of the po licy. But 
a revised proposal , which Mi ll supports the policy but takes issue 
with the policy's vag ueness , is a lmost ce l1ain to pass. 

So how can the A.S. contemplate such an irrespon ible course? 
The answer goe, to the heart of all that is wrong with the Council 
th is year: oversensiti vity to ethnic issues. There is a widespread 
perception around the A.S. offices that if one oppose a certain 
fac tion on the A.S., one will be denounced as rac ist. The fighting

A.S. and Programming: TGs at Risk? 
B~' DA VID BURKHART, Opinion Editor In the name of .. 1I .. hIL d i v t! r~ 1 

they have created divisivene\ \ . The oversen~itivity 10 ethnic 
is,ues mentiont!d in the editorial 
10 the left has extended to an area 
dear to students' heans; program-
ming. The anecdotal evidence on 
the hump suggests that this year's 
TGI Fs have been beller than ever 
before. That's probably an exag-
geration, but there's no queslion 
that UCSD' only real student-
wide tradit ion has been well re-
ceived th is year. Bands uch a 
Red Flag and MOJO ixon were 
very popular. Last year's refrain 
of "not anolher reggae band! " has 
disappeared, 

But a problem aro e at the be-
ginning of the year. Ramirez ap-
proached the A.S . programming 
commi sioner, Matt Schnurer, and 
a ked that several TGs be "cultur-
ally sensiti ve." Schnurer, unfortu-
nately. acquiesced. 

The fi rst sign of real trouble 
was "Elvis Week." Schnurer had 
his hean set on a week devoted to 
a campy celebration of Elvi 
Presley, with possible appearances 
by Mojo Nixon, Elvis impersona-
tors, and perhap even Elvis Cos-
tello. 

But the idea was shot down 
because Eh IS. not , urprisingly for 
a Southerner of hb time. had al-

legedl ~ uttered rac ially insensi .. 
live rt!marks. Th IS apparently 
mude hIm Indlg ible fo r a week of 
light ndlcuk and fu n. 

It didn' t end there. Ramirez, 
\\- IIh the support of the 
n:prest!l1tative he forced chnu rer 
to put on the prog ramm ing 
committee, Vanness Harriss, and 
admini strators, press ured 
Schnurer into signing a document 
agreeing to program the cultural 
TG,. 

This wa a serious mistake on 
Schnurer's part. lie shouldn' t have 

~ig ned the document, and he 
should have explai ned that as an 
elected repre entat i ve, he had the 
right to run hi offi ce as he wished. 
But certain powers in the A.S . 
took advantage of Schnurer's 
inexperience, and Schnurer came 

BENSON 

to regret it. 
Every move he made on pro-

gramming began to be second-
guessed. Ramirez said that when 
he discovered Syd Straw was 
programmed for the TG at the end 
of Asian Awarene s week, he was 
"disgusted." He added th31 Fall 
Quarter's TGs, despite theirpopu-
larity, were not what he was look-
ing for. He i now forcing Sch-
nurer to ubmit weekly reports on 
the progress of programming cul-
turally sensitive events. 

ThepeoplecriticizingSchnurcr 
simply do not understand the 
complexities of programming. As 
one source put it, if you have a 
chance to book a band , by the time 
you take it to commi ttee, the band 
is booked at San Diego State. 
Programming is fast -paced, and 
the critics are not offerir.g to do 
the work. They simply want Sch-
nurer to magically make cultural 
bands appear. The source added, 
"Ramirez has no bu iness in pro-
gramming." 

Schnurer 's critics have taken 
the position they know what's best 
for students; TGs shouldn ' t fea-
ture bands students want to see, 
they should be bands that educ?tc 
students. But that position is non-
sense; the critics want to take one 
of the few unltylng event , at 
UCSD and pOison il with poli tics. 

Wurst of all, ~ uch a vacuum of 
real leadership ereare, a ll opening 
for the administration to exploit 
the situation. There are already 
murmurs around the Price Cenler 
third floorthat administrator (and 
some student leaders) want to get 
rid ofTGs alltogether.This would 
be a tragedy. 

This issue is really a nation-
wide one; mu, ic has fragmented 
into racial cla" ifications. A band 
that anempts to em,sover, , uch as 
Living Colour. i regarded with 
the same intere, t as a two .. headed 
dog. Ramirez made it clear to 
Schnurer that an all black band 
would not atisfy him unless they 
were playing mu ic from their 
"culture. " 

This sort of nonsense has no 
place in deciding what bands to 
program. Schnurer should cer-
tainly program adiversity of bands, 
and he has done so. On his office 
door last week , next to the word 
"programming" wa a post-it 
which said "figurehead of." One 
source said Schnurer's "hean Just 
wasn' t in il anymore." It would be 
a real loss If a talen t such a, Mal t 
Schnurer wa, lo~t to the students. 
Thc A.S. Council hould let Mall

The ABCs of Government 
Editor: 

I th ink the new pub, the Bullseye Tavern (Round Table) is ajoke, but 
even I was astounded at the mo t recent fi asco. Round Table temporarily 
halted alcohol sales after a minor wus arres ted for po~sessi ng alcohol 
and a fake ID (Guardian, Jan. 29). The arrest was made when under-
cover representatives from Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) slipped 
into the pub 's crowd at about 7;30 p.m. Jan. 26, and caughl the sludent 
wit h the alcohol and fake ID. 

Such an incident brings only one calm question to my stunned mind: 
is th is a free country? Since when would we Americans have to fear,uch 
gestapo-like secret services? I certainly don't like the idea of undercover 
infonners hiding behind every turn. If they are " infi ltrating" even pizza 
parlors, who knows what will stop them? How far can they be from the 
sanctity of our own home ? Even honest, law-abiding cilizens should

fear such a tum of events. What if, 
while sharing a pizza wi th older 
friends, you pick up an alcoholic 
drink, even if it is just to move it 
acro s the table? You just might 
find the person next to you slap-
ping some handcuffs on you and 
reading you your rights. And this 
isn't even a big undercover gov-
ernmental agency like the CIA; 
thi s is Alcoholic Beverage Con-
trol !

This has got to stop! If we let 
ABC steal our fundamenta l right, 
what are people in a real govern-
mental agency going to get away 
with? Perhaps they should stan 
routinely searching our homes for 
illegal substance . It is perfectly 
justified if the pub fiasco is! We 
have to choose, now! Are we free 
American or. . . Heil ABC!

Build, More Parking, Not RIMAe 
Editor: 

The proposed ncv. gym/arena (RIMAC) is 
projected to cost students $170 million in fees 
over the next 25 years. Parking shortages prevent 
many students who have paid for parking permits 
from finding a spot even at their own dorm. 
Americans exercise too little to maintain ideal 
cardiovascular health. What do these three seem-
ingly unrelated problems have in common? They 
can all be solved in one simple package deal. 
Here's how: Save $170 million by not building a 
new gym. Spend part to destroy campus parking 
lots and build new ones off campus, say east of 

6 Minute Prints! 
See FUJI's new AP5000 Color Copier 

('[be only macbine in San Diego County) 

Regent Rd. or in Torrey Pines Park. Rcplace the 
p'trking shuttle with ajogging course connecting 
the new lots to campus. The result: Students will 
save over $1 ()() million in fees while getting ade-
quate parking and a 3D-minute daily cardiovas-
cular work-out. 

Seriously, if we could even consider spendi ng 
$ f70 million in fees to build a new gym, why not 
first raise, through higher parking permit fees, the 
fraction of that amount needed to build a parking 
structure in the center of campu and necessary 
parking lots at dorms?

VOTE NO 
ON RIMAC 

A No Vote does not mean no new 
recreation facilities 
Campus Rec facilities are inadequate but the RIMAC proposal is not 
the answer. A NO vote will force the RIMAC committee to consider 
more reasonable alternatives. 

The proposed facility is unnecessar-
ily expensive 
Why does UCSD need a facility bigger than UCLA's Wooden Center 
and the Berkeley Center combined? $70 per quarter is an increase of 
over 500"10 in rec fees and increases current total student fees by 
13%. Students will shoulder over 80% of the financial burden for this 
facility yet will have no real control over the planning and use of this 
facility . 

An athletic facility should be 
considered separately from 
an events areaa. 
The athletic facility without the 5000-seat arena could be more cen-
trally located on land already set aside for such use. Separate plans 
would allow for economical alternatives such as an outdoor amphi-
theater for concerts.

The profe sor, smiling calmly, placed an 
,mn around me and began to care . my back 

po~~e~~ively. "I like your work, but it'~ below 
par. If you come to my house tonight. it would 
most cenainly help your grades." 

Never heard of anything like this? Maybe 
you're tempted to shrug it off. There is no way 
thiS could happen at thi s university , you might 
say. Wrong. Sexual harassment happens-
according 10 Nancy Wahlig,SlUdent Safety 
Awarene~s Coordinator - even at UCSD. 

What is sex ual hara sment? 
Wahlig said: "A 101 of studenls don ' I know 

what sexual harassment is, and a lot of people 
don ' t know what to do." 

The Universi ty says that it is any unwel-
come sexual advance or request, ei ther verbal 
or physical, which is intimidating, affects a 
person's perfonnance, or is used as a ba is for a 
grade, posirion, or job. 

However, Kimberly Kinchen, a member of 
the A.S. Presidential Task Force on Sexual 
Harassment, said sexual hara sment t doesn't 
necessarily imply the intent to have sex. A 

phra~e such as "if you go out with me, you can 
have this job" can be con trued as sexual har-
assment. 

According to Kinchen, A.S. President John 
Ramirez created the task force to show that 
"the Universi ty is serious abo ut dealing with 
the issue of sexual harassment." 

Would YOU Like a Job ()verseas '! 

Kinchen said as most students are oblivious to 
the occurrence of sexual harassment , many 
victim are unaware of the resources that ex ist on 
campu . The task force intends to make such 
resources more accessible. The resources include 
Counseling and Psychological Services, Student 
Legal Services, and Resident Deans' Offices. 

Wahlig is the primary campus staff member 
dealing with sexual harassment. Wahlig offers 
counseling and can help initiate either formal or 
informal proceedings against policy violators. 

However, Wahlig sa id , " I haven'l had any 
students go through formal hearings." 

And, according to the Association of American 
Colleges, most persons sex ually harassed-

Wahlig said that her office has

" I give them option~," Wahlig

they can go to the depal1ment chair

Wahlig sa id that women aren't 
the only victims of sex ual harass-

"Men and women have been 
victims, and men and women have

You could probably survive 
without a personal computer. Af-
ter all , college students have got-
ten by just fine without them,proba-
bly for hundreds of years. 

But today's personal comput -
ers are more than just glorified 
Nintendos or ex pen ive typewrit-

versa tility - anything you can 
think of doing with information, 
you can probably do better and

force hopes to provide a pool of 
peer cou nselors. 

"We want people to know how 
to deal with [sexua l harassment) , " 

The UCSD Guardian 

said Kin(;hen. 
The provision and training of 

peer counselors mu~t be arranged 
with Wahlig, and Kinchen is opti-
mistic about the program. 

"IWahligl expres-.cd a lot of 
enthu siasm about the ta5k rOlee:' 
she sa id . 

Kinchen abo encourages ~t u­
dents to become involved. Plans 
call for member~ of the task force 
to receive training from Wahlig, 
qualifying them to advbe other~ 
regarding sex ual hara~sment. 
Those interested may contact 
Ruben Duran or Auggie Orozco at 
the A.S. office, or Kinchen at 
534-3673. 

Also, those who feel they have 
been sex ually hara sed are urged 
to contact Wahlig at 534-5793. 

Kinchen hopes victims of sex-
ual harassment will get help. 
"[Now 1 there is this proce ,so 
please come forward. If you come 
forward. potential harassers wi ll 
begin to think twice."

faster wi th a personal computer. 

Desktop publishing is one of 
the fastest growing fields of per-
sonal computing. New innovations 
now allow you to create your own 
typestyles, transfer photos or d ra w-
ings onto computer disk, and for-
mat text and graphic ' in previ-
ously impossible ways. 

Many authors have even begun 
to self-publish their work through 
desktop publi shing, therefore 
bypas ing large publishing houses, 
and elling directly to consumers. 

Accounting has always been one 
of the mosl imponant uses for 

personal computers. The field is 
growing wi th larger and easier-to-
use software such as Micro ofl 
Excel , which merges pO\ e rful 
accounting functions with de ktop 
publishing features. 

Communications computing is 
yet anothe r field that has contin-

Computer 
Con tinued from page 9 
come into its own in the past few 
years, mainly because of lhe ad-
vent of the faster machines. Com-
puter-aided des ign is to drafting 
what word-process ing is to typing. 
It a \low~ engineers to fo rmul ate 

de~igns in the compute r before 
committing to their con truction. 

The first IBM Pe rsonal Com-
puters - based on the Intel 8088 
chip - we re introduced in August 
198 1. 

The machines were o riginally 
intended to , tore data on audio 
cassettes. Soon afte r. IBM made 
floppy d isk drives available forthe 
PC which sol ved a lot o f problems. 

With the floppy disk, a user 
could save work pe rmanentl y, 
quickly , and reliably. 

PC-compatibles , or "clones,.' 
can be obtained from a thou, und 
lillie companies from here to Hack-
ensack. or from large r compani es 
slich as Ilewlett ·Packarcl. Zenith , 
and Com paq (the company respon-
sible for the first PC-compatible). 
In fact, the make rs of clones often 
show up IBM when it comes to 
pelfomlance- andcenainly when 
it come to price. 

There are everal reasons why 
many companie produce IBM 
compatible machines. The PC was 
des igned ( 0 be mod ul ar, so anyone 
Wi lh a screwdriver could put i( 
togelher. The pan iB M used to 
build (he orig inal PC were primar-
ily developed and purchased from 
other vendor~.

Triton Rugby Grounds USD, 39-9 
By DOUG SHA DDLE 
SIll)]" Wriler 

UCSD ( 1-2) crushed Ihe Uni -
versi lY of San Diego (0- 1), 39·9 
Saturday afte rnoon in a rugby 
league game o n Warren Field . 

And to put it mildly, the game 
wasn' t even as close as Ihe score 
mig ht seem 10 indicate. 

Somehow, USD managed 10 
jump OUI 10 an early 9-6 lead on a 
s uccess ful try and a long 
dropkick, but Ihat was a ll il would 
get in what proved to be a Very 
long 60 minutes. 

"The team worked together, 
and we dominated Ihe game," 
team captain Adam " Troll " 
Lefkoff aid. "We played excep-
tionally well ." 

You can say thaI again. 
After falling behind 9-6, Ihe 

Tritons came storming back. 
Back Jason Morrison scored a try 
on a sIrong side end run , and 
three minutes later Leftoff 
knocked in a 30 yard dropkick to 
put UCSD up 15-9 at the half. 
TheTriton rugger never looked 
back. 

Thesecondhalfwasall UCSD 
as the Tritons pushed, hit, and 
knocked USD into submission, 
scoring 24 points in thirty min-
utes of hard-hirting action. 

The Trilons' first score in Ihe 
second half was indicati veofhow 
the team played througho ut the 
game. The forwards, anchored 
by veteran Bill Curcy and new-
comer Arne Pike dominated the 
USD offe nse with c rushing hits 
and bruising tackles. Consistently 
taking the ball away, they moved 
it to the backs. 

The backs, led by veterans 
Morrison , Lefkoff, and Pe te 
Christianson, proceeded to walk 
all over USD, making everallat-
erals before Morrison fell in the 
end zone for the try . 

" It was a collective game," 
Head Coach Tom Butler said. 
"The guys played logelher and 
jelled." 

Team captain Phil Te ncer 
agreed. 

"Fluidily was the key ," he said. 
"Un like previous games where 
the backs and the forwards didn ' t 
mesh, today we played as a team." 

NextSaturdayatl:OOonWar-
ren West, the Tritons take on the 
UCLA Bruins in what Butler 
promi es will be a wide-open 
barnstormer. 

"We match up well wilh them, 
and it should be a fast-paced, 
close game," Butler said. Three 
weeks ago, in preseason play, 
UCLA defeated the Tritons 6-4.

DOZEN SnCKS - Men's AAA floor Hockey 

Well, they're finally in the big leagues. Last year·s men's AA floor 
hockey champions have packed up their small· town bags and headed 
for the bright lights of AAA, where they arc being met with rave 
reviews everywhere they take thei r act. 

Do zen Sticks can be ca lled an expansion team of sorts, bu t Ihese 
guys are no Minnesota Timberwolves. After a 5-0 d rubbing of the 
PI/ekillg Drahos las t Wednesday, Slicks is now 2·1 and looking down the 
road towards the pres tigious AAA crown. 

Sticks has not allo wed a goat in their last two games, than ks largely 
to a magician of a goalie, Greg Koran. He has a slrong supporting cast 
for a defense, which is led by Joel Akemine, who could be, pound for 
pound, the stingiest defenseman in the game today. Mea nwhite, Matt 
Nielsen, Lars Haitz and Rand Lewis seem to be scoring at wi ll againsl

SraflWriler 
Entering his ninth season at 

UCSD. Head Coach Lyle Yates 
has turned around a ba eball pro-
gram that, before hi arrival, had 
never po ted a winning record. 

In the last four years. Yates has 
guided the Tritons to four traight 
wi nning easons, three trips to the 

CAA Regionals and. in 1987, a 
berth in the Divi ion III College 
World Series. The upcoming ea-
son has UCSD hoping to make a 
return trip to the College World 
Series and perhaps take home a 
national championship. 

1990 could be just the year to 
doir. 

The Tritons return eleven sen-
iors from last eason 's 23- 19 
squad. With the addition of ev-
eral key transfers, UCSD enters 
the 1990campaign brimming with 
confidence. 

'This is the most balanced club 
we 've ever had," Yates said. 
"We're stronger [this year] be-
cause of our experience and the 
outstanding new tran fers com-
ing in." 

Part of the experience can be 
seen in the Triton pitching staff. 

The tarting rotation is led by 
AII-Amencan Rick Rupkey, who 
posted a 1.64 ERA to accompany 
his 10-5 mark last lleason. Rupkey 
was recentl y rated in a fir t place 
tie as the top-rated player in Divi-
sion III (according to Basehall 
America). 

Senior J.J . Fi her, who struck 
out a team high 70 balters while 

posting a 7-2 record la t year will 
be UCSD' number two starter. 
The third spot in the rotation will 
belong to senior Dann Eaton, a 
transfer student from Emporia 
State Univer ity in Kansa . 

A pair of enior righthanders 
should add some depth to the 
staff. Mike Morgan led the Tri-

the team late la t eason after 
recovering from an off-season 

surgery prior to the 1989 cam-
paign. Both Morgan and To-
moloni will be used as spot start-
ers and relievers in 1990. Junior 
Ian Zook, who aw limited action 
last season, should be used more 
frequently in a relief role. 

In the infield, senior Dave
