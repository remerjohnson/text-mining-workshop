San Diego is 
moving into 
the big time, 
says 0 'Connor 
By ERIC CHAZANKIN 
Staff Writer 

San Diego Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor delivered her annual 
State of the City address Mon-
day night , in Balboa Park's Old 
Globe Theater. 

The address began shortly 
after the scheduled time of 6 
pm , as a standing-room-only 
crowd of more than 600 people 
packed the theater. 

Reading steadily and with 
little vis ible emotion from a 
prepared text, the mayor dis-
cussed several issues that she 
has been grappling with since 
taking office, and made a few 
new announcements . The 
members of the City Council 

sat behind her on the stage, fol-
lowing the speech on advance 
copies of the text. 

Meanwhile, several hundred 
protestors demanding addi-
tional AI DS funding from the 
city were organizing outside. 
Their chanting became audible 
inside the theatre toward the 
end of O'Connor's speech. 

At several points in the ad-
dress, the mayor seemed to be 
attempting to cast San Diego as 
a city important internationally, 
for she made comparisons 
between features of this city 
and several in Europe, such as 
Edinburgh, Scotland; Salzburg, 
Austria; and Paris . She also

'Tipsy Taxi' hits 
the streets today 
By CYNTHIA CHESY 

"Tipsy Taxi," a taxi service for 
intoxicated UCSD students, has 
begun its operation for the winter 
quarter, and free passes for the 
service are being handed out 
beginning today, according to 
Johnny Patterson, Associated 
Students ' Commissioner of 
Operations, Service and Enter-
prises at UCSD. 

Yellow Cab Co. ha been hired 
to provide the taxi service, which 
will run from 5 pm to 3 am 
Thursda ys through Saturdays 
until June 30, 1988 . The cabbies 
are instructed to pick up UCSD 
tudents within a J 5-mile radius 

of the chool as "an alternative 
to either driving a car while 
under the influence of alcohol , 
or being in a car whose driver is 
under the influence ," as stated 
on the purcha e order. 

"If you are at a party, a bar, if 
you a re in trouble or are any-
where a nd need a ride , we want 
y u to use [the se rvice] ," Pat -
ter on a id . "Everyone hould 
use it a much as po ible because 
it i there fo r the student ." 

T he tax i huttle is j ust one of 
the way the A. . is tr ing to use 

registration fees to serve the 
students directly. "The activity 
fee, instead of being used in-
directly as in discounts here or 
there , is being used to serve the 
students directly, so they can see 
it helping them," Patterson aid .. 

Last year approximately 100 
people used "Tipsy Taxi" each 
weekend , according to Patterson. 
This year Patter on expects 
people to use it more readily 
because of a tepped up ad-
vertising blitz. "We are passing 
out cards at EDNA, the libraries, 
record stores, student organi-
zation meetings, buying ad -
vertisement in the Guardian , 
pass ing them out a frater-
nity / sorority meetings, at the 
dorms and stapling them to 
lecture notes," he said . 

Patterson wants to lengthen 
the route as soon a more people 
show interest in the service . The 
current bounda ries for the service 
are ola na Beach to the north , 
east to Inter tate IS in Mira 
Mesa and the 805 freeway, a nd 
extending so uth to outh Mi -
sion Beach .

Proposals for the establish-
ment of an Asian-American 
Studies Program at UCSD were 
submitted to the Committee on 
Educational Policy fall quarter 
1987. 

The two proposals, one origi-
nating from Profes or James Lin 
of the mathematics department 
and the other by the tude nt-
based Asian-American Studies 
Committee (AASC), request the 
institutionalization of an Asian-
American Studies program and 
the hiring of a tenured faculty 
member who would teach the 
core courses and coordinate the 
development of the minor 
program. 

In technical terms, the pro-
posals ask for a 0.5 non-recurrent 
FTE (budget allocation) for at 
lea t three year (four years in 
the AASC propo al) to be used 
exclu ively to recruit and appoint 
part -time vi iting lecturer 
through different departments 
and program . As the program 
develop , some of the eour e 
taught by the e lec turer would 
become regular courses taught

by permanent faculty in those 
departments. 

Lin said that there are already 
some well -qualified UCSD 
facuity members who are willing 
to commit part time to the pro-
gram. What the program cru-
cially needs to get started , how-
ever, is a tenured faculty member 
who will devote his or her time 
fully in the planning and devel-
opment of the program. 

AASC members said that it is 
time for UCSD, which is the 
only campus in the UC system 
not to have an Asian-American 
Studie program, to have such a 
program ; particularly since 
UCSD has a izable Asian-
American student population 
and boa t a graduate school of 
international relations and Paci-
fic Rim studies. 

AASC members noted the 
irony in UCSD having a com-
plete and separate graduate 
school that focuses on the cul-
tures and economies of Asian 
countries, while at the same time 
ignoring the A ian people who 
are Ii ing in and are part of this 
country. They feel that having 
the program at UCSD will give

Dramatic advance in 
accelerator technology 

Los Alamos National Laboratory is 
helping to determine if a new class of 
high-temperature superconductor 
could dramatically advance accelera-
tor technology. 

Lab scientists are measuring a key 
physical characteristic of the new 
ceramic materials, and how they might 
behave if used to build or coat the 
radio-frequency cavities now found in 
most every accelerator. 

"Our measurements will help pin-
point the defense, research and com-
mercial potential of these highly pub-
licized superconductors." said George 
Lawrence, of the Lab's Accelerator 
Technology Division. 

Simply put, radio-frequency cavities 
are basketball-sized particle-boosting 
devices. Inside the devices, electric for-
ces boost. or "kick," particles zipping 
through an accelerator to useful ener-
gies. Cavities made from high-
temperature superconductors could 
lead to a new generation of more effi-
cient and compact accelerators. 

As a result, the lab's work has 
important implications to Strategic 
Defense Initiative programs and could 
significantly impact high-energy phys-
ics research into the basic forces of 
nature. Moreover, the data gleaned 
could have spinoffs to medical, semi-
conductor, communications, and other 
ind ustries. 

Most accelerators , sometimes called 
atom smashers, get a beam "up-to-
speed" by sending particles through an 
array of hundreds of radio-frequency 
cavities made of copper, a good con-
ductor of electricity, But, since 1962, 
researchers worldwide have been try-
ing to develop cavities from supercon-
ducting materials. Copper has measu-
rable resistance to the alternating 
electric currents that produce acceler-
ating forces . As a result, power is 
wasted . 

BLOOM .COUNTY 

By contrast, superconducting cavi-
ties conduct electricity more effi-
ciently, with minuscule power losses. 
Essentially, all radio-frequency energy 
put into these versions is used to 
"kick" particles to higher velocities. 
All the energy goes into the particle 
beam, instead of being wasted through 
resistance that heats cavity walls . That 
could sharply cut an accelerator's 
operating cost. 

In addition, superconducting cavi-
ties could , in principle, give particles a 
more powerful kick over a given dis-
tance, producing higher quality beams 
and more compact accelerators. 

After 20 years of development, only 
now are superconducting cavities find-
ing use in accelerators . Such cavities, 
usually made of niobium, a silvery 
metal, require expensive, complex 
refrigeration systems. And niobium 
must be cooled up to two to four 
degrees Kelvin, or liquid helium 
temperature, to superconduct. 

The new ceramics, however, super-
conduct at much warmer conditions, 
77 degrees Kelvin, or liquid nitrogen 
temperatures. So, cooling systems 
using liquid nitrogen, which costs 
about the same as milk, would be far 
cheaper and simpler to install and 
operate. Still, before the ceramics are 
put into accelerators, with simpler 
cooling systems, it must first be shown 
they are extremely efficient . Other-
wise, it pays to keep using copper or 
niobium technology. 

Canadian research materials 
donated to U C libraries 

The Association for Canadian Stu-
dies in the United States (ACSUS) has 
donated a comprehensive set of con-
temporary Canadian research mate-
rials to the University of California 
libraries. 

The collection is considered the 
most thorough survey and analysis of 
Canadian public policy mailers ever 
conducted. It consists of material on 
Canadian politics , economic, public 
policy and law. Also included is a 
three-volume final report of the Royal 
Commission on the Economic Union 
and Development Prospects for Can-
ada, also known as the Macdonald 
Report. 

Funding for the gift comes from a 
grant by the William H. Donner 
Foundation of New York City, which 
has donated sets of the materials to 
selected American universities to pro-
mote Canadian studies. The value of 
the collection is estimated at $1,500. 

Calvin Moore, UC associate vice 
president for academic affairs, 
thanked the ACSUS and the Donner 
Foundation, saying, "We are very 
grateful for this useful addition to our 
library collection and appreciate the 
fact that the University of California is 
being recognized for its interest in 
Canadian studies. " 

The materials will be distributed 
among libraries at UC campuses to 
complete existing partial colIections of 
the materials. 

Muller-Eberhard recipient of 
1987 Robert Koch Medal 

Dr. Hans J. Muller-Eberhard, 
adjunct professor of pathology at the 
UCSD School of Medicine, is the 1987 
recipient of the Robert Koch Medal in 
gold . 

MulIer-Eberhard was honored for 
his contributions toward the explana-
tion of the human complement system, 
a complex of protein molecules in the 
blood which participate in the destruc-
tion of infectious agents slIch as bacte-
ria and ,viruses. His studies have pro-
vided a precise understanding of the 
molecular basis of complement activa-
tion and the application of these 
insights to clinical medicine. 

Muller-Eberhard received his medi-
cal degree from the Medical School of 
the University of Goeltingen, West 
Germany and a doctorate in medical 
sciences from the University of 

. 

U ppsala, Sweden. He joined the 
UCSD faculty in 1968 and is a 
member of the National Academy of 
Sciences. He was a member of the 
Scripps Clinic and Research Founda-
tion from 1963 to 1988 . 

The medal is given annually by the 
Robert Koch Foundation, West Ger-
many, for extraordinary accomplish-
ments in basic research of infectious 
diseases. Muller-Eberhard was pres-
ented with the award in a ceremony in 
Bonn, West Germany. Dr. Susumu 
Tonegawa, winner of the 1987 Nobel 
Prize in medicine, was the recipient of 
the award in 1986. Tonegawa received 
a doctorate in biology from UCSD in 
1968.

In new theory 
• HIV virus 

said not to 
cause AIDS 
By MAUREEN SPURR 
SIG// Wriur 

Th~ virus said to cause AI DS may not be the culprit, and 
scientists may be misdirecting their efforts in their study of 
that virus, according to a professor of molecular biology at 
UC Berkelev. 

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (H IV), detected in the 
overwhelming majority of AIDS patients, has become the 
focus of Dr. Peter Duesberg's argument. Duesberg, who was 
co-discoverer of the first oncogenes, or cancer-causing 
genes, claims that there should be no cause for alarm if HI V 
is present in human blood, and that the AIDS test only 
measures the antibodies produced by this virus and not the 
virus itself. 

Bio / Technology Journalfeatures Duesberg's views in the 
November issue, with the article summarizing the points he 
made last May in Cancer Rescarch, the leadingjournal in its 
field . 

Three criteria must be met before a virus can be said to 
function as a disease-causing agent, but almost none of the 
data demonstrate that this virus satisfies any ofthis criteria, 
Duesberg writes. A disease-causing virus must be biochemi-
cally active . It mu t infect or intoxicate more cells than the

San Diego: Arts festival on the way the Olympics. "A success here wiII elevate San Diego to the sta-tus of an international sports 
center used year-round by the 
world's best athletes and train-
ers," O'Connor stated. 

Continued from pale 1 
Dostoevsky. 

"San Diego has begun to 
assume her rightful position as 
an actor on the national and 
international stage," O'Connor 
said . 

This international tone was in 
keeping with the one major, new 
announcement the mayor made 

clearly intends to maintain her 
'old' enthusiasm. "For those of 
you bored with my last year's 
obsession for sewers, I offer this 
year's obsession - trash!" she 
said. 

On other issues, the mayor 
said that she wanted to try to get 
federal funding for the restora-
tion of buildings in Balboa Park 

in 1988. She also briefly discussed 
the problems the San Diego 
Police Department has had over 
the last year, mentioned a new 
crack / cocaine detail and the hir-
ing of eight Indochinese officers 
to help ease tensions in San Die-
go's southeast Asian community. 

The mayor then moved on to 
slightly less serious issues, dis-

cussing San Diego's success in 
bringing sporting events here. 
She mentioned the Super Bowl, 
the America's Cup races, and the 
extension of the Padres' lease 
until the year 2000. 

She made one new an -
nouncement in this area : San 
Diego is negotiating to become 
the year-round training site for 

The mayor also presented the 
"State of the City Awards," rec-
ognizing San Diegans who have 
made outstanding contributions 
to the city over the last year. 

O'Connor made only a brief 
mention ofthe AI DS crisis, doing 

See PROTEST, pace 5 
- "that the City of San Diego ,-______________________________ . _ ________ _________ _ 
has entered into negotiations to 
host a month-long festival of the 
arts drawn from the vast trea-
sures of the Soviet Union ." She 
added that the festival "is per-
haps two years away." 

O'Connor began her speech 
by discussing more immediate 
issues, such as the city's rapid 
growth-rate, and some of the 
problems which have accompan-
ied it. "San Diego's inner city 
sewer system was built at the 
turn of the century when our 
popUlation was just 17,000 . . . 
Some of those original pipes are 
still with us!" she declared. 

The sewage problem was a 
focus of her address in 1987 as 
well. This year, she cited addi-
tional federal funding, moving 
to a better water treatment sys-
tem, and making progress on 
preventing Tijuana sewage from 
crossing the border as accomp-
lishments in this area. 

O'Connor seems ready to move 
on to new problems, though 

Plan 
Continued from pace I 

"Every University of Califor-
nia campus has a document 
known as a long-range develop-
ment plan [master plan] that 
guides future physical growth on 
campus," Collum explained in 
her presentation about what the 
UCSD master plan is, and how it 
is being implemented. 

The master plan for UCSD 
was drawn up in 1981,whenonly 
four colleges had been established 
(Revelle, Third, Warren and 
Muir) and Warren was located 
in the Matthews Complex, where 
a "temporary Fifth College" and 
its administrative buildings now 
stand. 

The 1981 plan identified sites 
for the four colleges and pro-
vided for the creation of two 
more colleges, one of those being 
Fifth 'College which is preparing 
to receive its first students this 
fall. 

The fundamental idea behind 
the master plan was that the col-
leges would be grouped around 
the anticipated future center of 
the UCSD campus, which in-
cludes Cenlral Library and the 
Price Center, scheduled to open 
in 1988. The plan also calls for 
the modern architecture of many 
undergraduate facilities to be 
offset by a natural reserve area 
north of Central Library, and 
landscaping that includes plant-
ing new eucalyptus trees and sav-
ing the remaining trees after fin-
ishing construction around 
Central Library. 

Collum said that land has been 
set aside east of Intersta te 5 for 
recreation use and recreational 
and sports facilities , as well as 
for a new track on the northeast-
ern end of the campus. These, 
she said , are just some of the 
expansion plans already un-
derway . 

In response to a student's 
question about the final decision 
of the expan ion of Central 
Library, Collum said that the 
addition to UCSD's main library 
will be entirely underground . [Q)

Editor's note: The following 

article was released by the Soviet

Over the last month the U.S .

in and around the Republic of 
Afghanistan, even as t here

In thi connection, the USS R 
Emba sy in Washington wishes 
to call attention to the oviet 
position on Afgha ni tan, pub-
licly articulated by Mikhail 
Gorbachev during his official 
visit to the United tates. 

Underlying the oviet Union's 
approach to the sit uation in 
Afghanistan is its position that is 
is necessary to assure peoples ' 
right to security, to life, and to 
conducting their national affairs 
as they see fit. We stand for a 
settlement in Afghani tan that

Protest 
Continued from pace 3 
so in her conclusion . As specta-
tors were exiting the theater, 
however, they were greeted by 
several hundred people protest-
ing for increased AIDS funding 
from the city. 

Chanting and shouting from 
behind a line of uniformed police, 
the protestors waved replicas of 
tombstones, each representing 
one of the more than 300 San 
Diegans who have died from the 
disease so far. They used slogans 
such as "AI DS funding now," 
.. ilent no more," "How many 

more must die ," and "Where's 
your honor, O'Connor?" 

As the crowd of spectators 
moved over to the area of a 
reception that the mayor was 
holding following the speech, the 
chanting protestors moved along 
with them. With more than a 
dozen police officers controlling 
their movements, the protestors 
found themselves shouting at the 
crowd from behind a fence and 
several iron gratings. They stuck 
their signs and faces through the 
fence and continued their chant-
ing to the beat of a drum as those 
who had watched the speech 
passed by only a few feet away. 

(In an interview following her

speech, O'Connor said that under 
a city / county agreement , the 
county had responsibility for 
AIDS funding, not the city 
government, which she heads.) 

The chanting from behind the 
fences and gratings continued to 
reverberate through the court-
yard outside the reception hall as 
the reception got under way, 
although it was not loud enough 
to be disruptive inside the hall. 
I nside, people clustered around 
the mayor and city council-
members, eating chocolate cake 
and cookies. Reporters scribbled

Proposal 
Continued from pace 1 
all students the opport unity to 
understand the Asian-American 
experience, and c iCe the ri se in 
racism and anti -Asian violence 
a s a reason for starting the 
program. 

Lin added that he has received 
a number of letters from stu-
dents and other members of the 
communit y requesting such a 
program at UCSD. As a result , 
experimenlal courses have been, 
and are being, offered at UCSD 
(i .e., History 191 offered this 
quarter) to test the response of 
the student population . 

Lin pointed out , however, that 
if student s indeed want an 
Asian-American Studies pro-
gram here at UCSD, they should 
enroll in such classes to support 
the need for such courses and to 
justify institutionalization of the 
program. 

The AASC proposal 
asks that student 
opinion be given a lot 
of weight in the for-
mation and devel-
opment of ,the pro-
gram. 

AASC representative Samoa 
Koria said that the differences 
between the two proposals are 
minimal and that the main rea-
son fort he AASC proposal being 
drafted is to supplement the 
faculty-based proposal with a 
student perspective. 

Lin's proposal structures the 
program so that it has three core 
courses (two lower division his-
tory courses on the contempor-
ary Asian-American community 
and one upper division course in 
history), along with three elec-
tives. 

The AASC's proposed curric-
ulum gives the student a freer 
hand by requiring only that at 
least three of the six courses be 
upper division. Also , the AASC 
proposal asks that student opin-
ion be given a lot of weight in the 
formation a nd developme nt of 
the program. 

If approved , the Advisory 
Committee for Asian-American 
Courses, working closely with 
Vice Chancellor Harold Ticho, 
will o versee the implementation 
of the program in the 1988-89 
academic year. (Q]

Duesberg goes on to say, how-
ever, that the AIDS virus is not 
biochemically active in Al DS 
patients and is only present in an 
extremely small percentage of 

res ts o n the reaso ning that when 
the virus is inactive it triggers no 
AI DS sy mptoms. and wh en 
AIDS symptoms arise the virus 
is inactive. Also, no other virus, 
o r a ny other infectious agent, is 
known to cause disease when it is 
inactive . HIV ma y not contri-
bute to AIDS at all ; in stead , 
Duesberg writes, it ma y just be 
part of the viral baggage carried 
by AIDS patients, and many 
without AIDS , causing few ill 

effects. 
Furthermore~ he co ntinues. 

H IV is said to incapacita te T-
ce lls, o ne of the most cr itical 
compo nents in the immune sys-
tem. S ince retroviruses a re not 
known to kill cells - depending 
on li ving, multiplying host cells 
to survive then it would fo l-
low that T-cells would ha ve to 
tay alive and multiply to keep 

the retrovirus alive.

their susceptible cells . It is a ret- ,------------------------ ----------- - --- - -------------
rovirus , meaning it does not kill 
cells in order to survive. In fact. 
no human diseases have , been 
attributed to retroviruses. 

Duesberg was the first to 
develop a genetic map of retro-
viruses, and his results have been 
found valid for all viruses of this 
type. A member of the National 
Academy of Science and an 
authority of molecular biology 
of animal viruses, Duesberg has 
been working with retroviruses 
for over 23 years. 

Duesberg claims that measur-
ing the presence of antibodies to 
H I V is useless since they develop 
naturally as indicators that the 
body has overcome infection . 
On the other hand , proponents 
of the HIV-AIDS connection 
maintain that antibody produc-
tion is a sign that the virus will 
eventually overcome the body 
and that it remains latent in the 
system anywhere from months 
to years. 

"This is an unorthodox inter-
pretation of antibody produc-
tion ," J)uesberg said in an inter-
view. Simultaneous to infection 
with the virus, no AIDS symp-
toms appear. Genetic experi-
ments indicate that all of the 
HIV virus genes are functioning 
at this time, Duesberg writes. 
There are no candidates for lat-
ent AI DS genes in the virus that 
could become active some five 
years after infection and then 
cause AIDS, he maintains. 

"With something that exists at 
such a low concentration and is 
something hardly detectable, [the 
possibility of it] killing us is 
highly unlikely," Duesberg said . 

This virus does not meet the 
criterion of infection in adequate 
numbers, actively infecting fewer 
than one in 10,000 to 100,000 
susceptible cells , Duesberg 
writes. When other retroviruses 
cause disease they infect nearly 
all susceptible cells. 

In short, Duesberg's claim

V olunteering for peace 
By JULIE MUNRO 
Guardian Inlrrn 

Mention of the Peace Corps 
often brings to mind images of 
the '60s, but the presence of the 
Corps today proves that the or-
ganization is much more than an 
historical phenomenon. Present-
ly, there are about 5,200 Peace 
Corps volunteers and trainees 
working in 62 nations around 
the world . In 1987, 20 UCSD 
students were nominated to 
Peace Corps programs with 13 
having already started their train-
ing. In the fall quarter of this 
year, 21 UCS D students applied 
to the program. 

Volunteers are fully supported 
while abroad by Peace Corps 
funds. In addition, they are sup-
plied with transportation, any 
needed health care, up to 48 days 
of vacation , and an adjustment 
allowance upon return to the 
United States after their two 
year assignment. These material 
compensations, however, hardly 
seem worth fighting over in view 
of the primitive lifestyles adopted 
by most of the volunteers. Appli-
cants aren't even permitted to 
choose the country to which they 
want to go . Bacl:ground in a for-
eign language may be influential, 
but some volunteers are sent to a 
country without any familiarity 
with its language. 

What motivates people to give 
up flush toilet , garbage dispo-

sals, microwaves and televisions 
and head for the Thin4 World? 
Why would anyone want to risk 
spending two years of their life 
eating with their hands, living in 
mud hut , and drawing water 
from a well at sunrise? This seem-
ingly bizarre desire can only be 
explained by what the Peace 
Corps volunteers consider to be 
priceless immaterial benefits. 

Jeof Land, a student at 
UCSD's Pacific Rim Graduate 
School, spent two years teaching 
Spanish in Grenada with the 
Peace Corps after graduating 
from UCSB with a Spanish 
major. He believes that the most 
valuable achievement of the 
Peace Corps is "the experience 
[the volunteers] get .. . . It edu-
cates Americans about what life 
is like in other parts of the world 
and they bring that back to the 
U.S." 

However, volunteers' positive 
experience with the people they 
meet abroad, Land aid, is ex-
tremely important because the 
volunteer' presence can alleviate 
the prejudices about Americans 
and help to improve realtions

tained that "you can't talk about 
global cooperation and global 
peace without first starting at an 
individual level." 

Land was able to establish 
?imself in Grenada by becoming 
~mmersed in the culture and as 
Independent from the Peace 

Corps organization as po sible. 
He became involved in the ports 
which were central to the youth 
in Grenada. He played soccer, 
started a basketball team, coach-
ed a school team, and even start-
ed a surf c1u b with boards he had 
shipped in, as well as with ones 
he and his students made there. 

Bill and Joan Clabby were 
sent to Senegal from 1985 to 
1987, assigned to work on com-
munity development. Bill grad-
uated from UCSD with a double 
major of management science 
and French Literature. Joan 
graduated from San Diego State 
University with a business major.

Although they built a number of 
wells and gardens, Joan said that 
in taking stock of how they made 
a difference in Senegal, "those 
are not the [things] I count." Bill 
added that the way Peace Corps' 
projects "improves [a communi-
ty's] ability to work together is 
what really counts ." 

Joan Clabby's field work was only part of her volunteer experience.

how to clean wounds, were what 
really made a difference. Finally 
Joan said that seeing a white per-
son that was not a tourist "made 
an immense difference in [the 
natives1lives" by disproving the 
villagers' previous conceptions 
that all whites sleep until noon, 
carry cameras around, and are 
rich. However, sometimes the 
villagers were left with different 
stereotypes. Because Peace 
Corps volunteers are the only 
white people who learn Senegal's 
national language, the Clabbys 
and other volunteers' language 
skills left the villagers insistent 
that all Americans learn lots of 
languages. 

UCS D Biology Professor 
Michael Gilpin taught computer 
science in Turkey at the Middle 
East Technical University with 
the Peace Corps from 1967 to 
1969. Gilpin explained that vol-
unteers gain a lot of confidence 
and maturity through the chal-
lenge of the experience. He said 
that he would "recommend [the 
Peace Corps] strongly for almost 
anyone." 

Joan Clabby cxpained that 
the village where she worked was 
also required to supply 20 per-
cent of expenses for any given 
project. This contribution, in the 
form oflabor or supplies, insured 

A Choice, 

the village's interest in projects. 
This way the villagers have an 
investment to protect. For ex-
ample, the Clabby's village in 
Senegal supplied labor and sand, 
which was naturally plentiful, to 
build five wells, which WOUld, in 
turn, collect valuable fresh water 
for drinking, cooking, and wash-
ing. The local government also 
su pplied a percentage of the 
Peace Corps' resources and took 
an interest in the progress of 
these developments because they 
also had a stake in them. The 
C1abbys were required to submit 
reports to the local government, 
and representatives were sent by 
the government to inspect the 
village's progress. 

Although Joan said that volun-
teers are supposed to be as polit-
ically neutral as possible while 
on an assignment, she agreed 
that the placement of volunteers 
is semi-political. For a country 
to get funding, Bill said, "they 
have to please Reagan." Joan 
pointed out that Belize, in Cen-
tral America, is "an itty-bitty 
country, but the U.S. is wooing it 
to keep it from going commu-
nist" with a disproportionately 
large group of about 100 volun-
teers. 

In spite of this influence, how-
ever, the Clabbys feel that Peace

Corps volunteers are in their 
own class and very highly re-
garded by host populations. Al-
though a small civil war was 
being fought near their village, 
the CIabbys always felt safe. They 
had been adopted by a family in 
Senegal who was, like the other 
villagers, very protective of the 
volunteers. The Clabbys were 
confident that the Peace Corps 
would never place a volunteer in 
any dangerous area . 

The volunteers do not always 
complete assignments as plan-
ned. Six of the 30 in the Clabby's 
training group left early. If a 
volunteer turns out to be unsuit-
able for the work, which Peace 
Corps Public Affairs manager 
Chama R. Lefton said is rare, 

they have the option of going 
home. It's difficult to make gen-
eralizations about why volun-
teers leave because volunteer ex-
periences are as varied as the 62 
countries involved. 

Bill warned that volunteers 
must be comfortable alone be-
cause language and cultural bar-
riers may isolate them at first. 
They must also, however, be able 
to give up their privacy because 
they may be constantly surround-
ed by villagers. Joan said volun-
teers must be able to laugh at 
themselves when they get in some 
awkward positions - something 
which is bound to happen in a 
new country and culture. 

Although Lefton explained 
that volunteers are only sent to 
countries whose government has 
sent a job description to Wash.-
ington, D .C., requesting volun-

they do not already have (they 
receive over 2.400 requests each 
year) . These requests do not, 
however. guarantee that the 
Peace Corps will still be wanted 
two years down the road . For 
example, Turkey kicked the 
Corps out two weeks after Gilpin 
left hi university teaching posi-
tion. Gilpin said that the Turks 
"saw Americans as upstarts,"and 
were insulted to have such a rela-
tively young country teaching 
their old, traditional one. 

Although on a one-to-one 
basis Gilpin was received very 
warmly by colleagues and stu-
dents of the Turkish university, 
the students as a group were

lantic Treaty Organization) and 
antagonized the program as a

Men's basketball 
wins fifth straight 

Come from behind to top 
Pomona-Pitzer 77-64 

By MIKE U'REN 
Last night the men's basket-

ball team overcame a 33-29 half-
time deficit to defeat Pomona-
Pitzer 77-64. The Tritons scored 
48 points in the second half, and 
were led by starters Kevin Ste-
wart (19), Andy Wagstaff (17), 
and reserv\: guard Greg Pask-
weitz (15). 

When asked about the play of 
his team, Coach Tom Marshall 
replied , "It was a very poor per-
formance . The first half was one 
of the worst halves of basketball 
I've ever seen ." On a positive 
note Marshall was impressed 
with the play of guards Bill Gerl-
ach, Dan Troy and Paskweitz. 
"Gerlach, Troy and Paskweitz 
applied great defensive pressure 
tonight." 

"These guys often go unno-
ticed but it was their defense that 
allowed us to get the good scor-
ing opportunities we had in the 
second half," Marshall said .

W. B-ball 
loses 67-59 
By MIKE FOLEY 
Stll/.! Writer 

With Western Connecticut 
leading 38-15 at halftime of 
Tuesday night's women's bas-
ketball game in the main gym, 
many fans mllV hav,., h,.,.o wno_ 
dering if it would be worth thei. 
while to stick around for the 
second half. But anyone that did 
decide to leave missed a great 
second half rally by the Triton 
women even though they came 
up short 67-59. 

Tuesday's game started out 
close as both teams traded 
baskets and three-point shots, 
b\lt with the score tied 9-9 West-
ern Connecticut started to take 
control. The Colonials started to 
use their superior size to score 
many easy baskets inside. As 
Western Connecticut started to 
hit their shots consistently, 
UCSD went ice-cold . UCSD had 
some good shots but just could 
not get them to fall. As a result 
UCSD found themselves being 
outscored 29-6 during the last 15 
minutes of the first half. This 
game appeared to be heading 
toward a serious blowout. 

The Tritons closed within two 
points by scoring the first basket 
of the second half, but Pomona-
Pitzer proceeded to open up a 
39-32 lead . After cutting the lead 
to three points, Wagstaff made 
the basket and was fouled. He 
then converted the three-point 
play by making the free throw to 
tie the game at 39-39. 

6'10" Andy Jedynak won both lipotfs In the Trilon victory. 
If the Tritons were going to 

make this game respectable they 
were going to have to shoot 
much better than the 18 Dercent 
they shot in the first half. What-· 
ever Coach Judy Malone said at 
halftime to fire up her team must 
have had some effect on the 
players. UCSD started out 
quickly in the second as Chris 
McCallum quickly hit a turn 

Point-guard Rob Rittgers. 

After a ten-foot jumper by 
Wagstaff and another three-point 
play by Stewart, the Tritons never 
lost the lead and the route was 
on. 

Beside Stewart, Wagstaff and 
Paskweitz, the Tritons also 
placed two other starters in dou-

ble figures . Rob Rittgers, the 
6'1 " point-guard for the Tritons 
scored 12 and senior center Andy 
Jedynak chipped in JO points. 
Gerlach and Nick Capuano 
rounded out the scoring with 
two apiece . Wagstaff was also 
the leading rebounder for the

SPORTS 

Still down by 22 points, UCSD 
now needed some tough defense 
to get back into the game. The 
Tritons started a full-court press 
that caught Western Connecti-
cut off guard, leading the Colon-
ials into making some turnovers 
that UCSD cashed in for easy 
baskets. 

Despite falling by nine points, 
UCSD had to be proud of its 
second half effort. As Coach 
Malone summed up the game, 
"We were like two different teams 
out there tonight." [Q)

Volume 17 

New$ anchored 
in reality 

by kristen mccleary 
features editor 

It's no coincidence that the Christmas season films are all major releases 
attempting to cover or examine issues of epic proportions. It is Academy 

Award time , after alii and studios think the more grandiose their films , the 
higher their chances of obtaining the coveted awa rd. 

One director , however, has foregone the Spielberg route of expansive (and 
expensive) visuals in his filmmaking and opted insteaJ to emphasize those elements 
which made his past endeavor I "Terms of Endearment" (which was nominated fo r 

11 and won three academy awards in 1983), so successful. In his newest film , 
"Broadcast News," James L. Brooks explores an industry of phenomenal size and im-
portance (network news) in a small way: by focusing on its characters. 
Like "Terms of Endearment," "Broadcast News" relies on the strength of its character 

development to carry through a plausible story line. This movie doesn't buckle under the 
weight of the hard-hitting symbolism which often grounded Spielberg's "Empire of the 

Sun," nor does it turn into a tale of clearly defined morality like Oliver Stone's pre-
dictable "Wyll Street ," the season's other film based on big industry. 

"Wall Street" was full of stock characters (no pun intended) where "Broadcast News" 
seems to revel in the complexity and knowability of Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the news 

producer, Tom Grunick (William Hurt), a sportscaster turned news anchorman, and Aaron 
Altman (Albert Brooks), the seasoned news reporter. 
The plot of "Broadcast News" revolves around the lives of these three individuals who become 

embroiled in a love triangle. Jane falls in love with Tom, who is dim but good-looking, and Aaron 
falls for his best buddy, Jane. Their careers add yet another dimension to this geometric tangle turning 
the love triangle into a love 'square.' 

All of these elements combine to create one of the greatest sex scenes filmed without intercourse 
actually occurring. From her control box Jane is linked to Tom, who's anchoring a fast-hitting news story I 
through a hidden ear piece, Aaron watches the newscast from his home and calls Jane on the phone with 
facts and questions to feed to Torn. 
From Aaron to Jane to Tom, information travels with an intimate and rhythmic precision. "h was like great 

sex!" Tom later tells Jane. "You knew exactly when to feed me the lines." 
Director Brooks has a long history of involvement with the news industry_ From a short stint as a copy boy in 

the early '60s to being a co-creator of the "Mary Tyler Moore Show," Brooks exhib.its great understanding of the

Macbeth-
Kabuki 

style 
by barry harris 

Boil , hoil, 
Toil and [rouble. 
Fire hurn and 
Caldron hubble. 

Witches are coming to 
UCSD. But these witches are 
never seen. Uttering Elizabe-
than incantations in dramatic 
than incantations in dramatic 
Kabuki style, they'll be a strik-
ing blend of two distincrly dif-
ferent theatrical traditions. 

When Shakespeare was 
writing his plays in the 16th 
century, Kabuki was reaching 
its artistic peak in Tokugawa 
Japan. Kabuki began as a sort 
of underground theater - a 
high-energy popular form of 
entertainment. Perhaps 
Kabuki's creation was a re-
sponse to the government-
promoted but overly highbrow 
and restrained theater of Noh. 
Kabuki in contrast was a more 
exciting and boisterous form 
of theater which attracted a 
more earthy audience. Many 
of the early Kabuki actresses 
were also prostitutes. 

Macbeth (Irwin Appel) and Lalry Macbeth (Spencer Beckwith) in Kabuki 
Macbeth. 

On the grounds of protect-
ing the public morality, the 
representatives of the Shogu-
nate stepped in and prohibited 
females from acting in Kabuki. 

Since then, the roles of women 
have been performed by men. 
The most esteemed actors in 
Japan have often specialized in 
portraying the Onnagata, the 
idealization of femininity. 

In the production to be per-
formed at Mandeville Audito-
rium' on Friday, Jan. 15 at 8 
pm, Spencer Beckwith will 
portray Lady Macbeth . Some 
of the other roles, the three 
witches for instance, will be 
portrayed by actresses. 

The Acting Company, the 
touring arm of the Kennedy 
Center for the Performing Arts 

in New York, which was 
founded in 1972 by John 
Houseman and Margot Har-
ley, employs select graduates 
of the best dramatic arts 
schools in bringing classical 
and contemporary plays to 
towns and cities across 
America. 

Kabuki Macbeth is Shakes-
peare with a twist. Macbeth 
will be enlivened by the dra-
matic posturing, energetic 
dar)cing, and vivid costuming 
that is characteristic of the 
Kabuki theater.

The 
Dead 

returns 
by phil maClovern 

hiatus writer 

In reviewing" Return of the 
Living Dead, Part 11," all of 
the basic review guidelines 
have to be discarded. The story 
is silly (it is touted as a 
horror I comedy) but that is 
expected from this film genre. 
People who go to see movies 
like this don't want serious 
entertainment. They are after 
only two things: gore and 
laughs. 

If that is what you want, 
that is what you 'll get from 
this movie. "Return of the 
Living Dead, Part II," scores 
high on both counts, providing 
many chuckles for the !lon-
squemish. 

The story 4s the usual horror 
fare. The Army is transporting 
toxic waste of some sort 
through a small town and one 
of the barrels falls off of a 
truck. It falls near a graveyard 
and, of course, this _ waste 
causes the dead to become un-
dead, and the living to turn 
into zombies. All the zombies 
want to do is eat human brains. 

The usual small child defends 
his sister, and the standard 
good-looking cable TV install-
er helps, falling in love with 
the sister. 

There are some goofy grave-
robbers thrown in who catch a 
whiff of the zombie gas, and 
they slowly start to crave grey 
matter. 

Zombies come out of the 
ground in droves, pursuing 
our hapless heroes, who are 
the onty humans in town, 
thanks to an Army evacuation. 
Our stalwart crew defend 
themselves but what good are 
guns against the un-dead? 

In the first movie (that 
brings up an interesting point: 
should this be the "Return of 

the Return 'of the Living 
Dead?") a nuclear explosion 
was needed to wipe-out .the 
nasties. 

In the sequel, the zombies 
are cut up into many pieces by 
many devices (shotguns, fists, 
car windows) and these pieces 
still want to eat human brains. 
This all drags out until the 
smart and brave teenagers find 
some ingenious way to get rid 
of all the walking creepies. 

Supposedly, this is not an 
attempt at a "spoof" of horror 
movies. It is serious. That is 
the scary part. The laughs are 
plentiful, but some are hard to 
take . When a zombie gets pun-
ched in the face and gore 
comes flying out it is funny 

A zombie rises from his grave in "Return of the Living DeaJ Part II ." 

because of the surprised look 
on the zombie's face and dis-
gusting for obvious reasons. 

I have a feeling that "Return 
of the Living Dead, Part II" is 
the type of movie that is a lot 
more fun seen in big groups, 
preferably after a few drinks. 

Otherwise, it really is not 
worth your money to go see 
this movie. Considering the 
price of movies these days and 
that there are better movies of 
this type out on video l you 
might be better off waiting 
until a bargain night.

punk thrashers. 
Since those early days, the 

Meat Puppets have moved 
toward a more individual 
sound, developing their own 
recognizable style. This 
became evident with the re-
lease of their 1985 album, 
"Up On the Sun." It was with 
the release of this album that 
critics and college radio began 
to take notice of the Meat 
Puppets. Their first college 
radio hit, "Swimming 
Ground," was even known to 
be receiving airplay on some 
of the mainstream stations.

the Meat Puppets . Noted as 
one of the hardest working 
bands on the SST Records 
label, the Meat Puppets have 
just released their second 
album in the last year, 
"Huevos." Proving that they 
intend to be an influential 
force in today's music scene, 
the Phoenix trio's latest effort 
is an excellent blend of tunes 
that could only be labeled as 
puppetesque. 

It wasn't, however, until the 
release of "Out of My Way" 
that the Meat Puppets' follow-
ing began to reach its upper 
bounds. The album received 
substantial critical acclaim, 
and enabled the band to get 
top billings across the coun-
try. With the release of their 
following album, "Mirage," 
the Meat Puppets were labled 
one of rock's best bands. 

Curt Kirkwood, Cris Kirkwood and Derrick Bostrom of the Meat Puppets. 

In 1982 the Meat Puppets 
- singer and gui tarist Curt 
Kirkwood , brother Cris Kirk-
wood on bass and vocals, and 
drummer Derrick Bostrom-
released the first sample of 
their music on vinyl. The 14-
song, 12" EP titled "Meat Pup-
pets" was labeled extremely 
raw and punk . Because of this 
record and the tour that fol-
lowed, the Meat Puppets 
gained an early reputation as 

This brings us to the most 
recent addition to the Meat 
Puppets' collec tion , " Hu-
evos." True to their ever-evol-
ving style, "Huevos" is an 
intuitive glance into the heart 

of the Meat Puppets. T ouch-
ing on guitarist C ris Kirk-
wood's ZZ Top and Led Zep-
pelin i.lfluences, "Huevos" dis-
plays a guitar-rock sound with 
a sample of country and blues 
roots. Recorded in Phoenix 
over a six-day period, and 
assisted by co-producer Steven 
Escallier, "Huevos" intends 
to make the Meat Puppets a 
recognizable name in the music 
industry.

News 
Continued from page 1 
mach inations and politics 
which exist behind the scenes 
of television news. 

"Broadcast News" even pre-
dicted the mass lay-offs at 
CBS news, for Brooks had 
written his fictional scenes of 
the same occurrence before 
the real ones took place. 

It comes as no surprise that 
this film explores the disturb-
ing trend in network news to 
put showmanship before con-
tent. For example, Tom gets 
the highly influential anchor 

position because of his good 
looks and ability to "sell the 
news." He's uneducated, can't 
write and has no reporting 
experience. Jane tells him, 
"You represent everything I 
find truly dangerous in a 
person." Aaron, the ethical 
news reporter calls Tom the 
devil "because he is going to 
lower the [news] standards bit 
by bit .... [besides] he'll get 
all the great women." 

Hence, a crucial part of the 
film's love tangle hinges upon 
the morality of its p layers. 
Aaron tells Jane about Tom's 
manipulation of a news tory 
in an effort to destroy their 
romance . Almost the reverse 

of this year's political char-
acter issue, Aaron's betting on 
the fact that the way Tom 
conducts himself in his pro-
fession will affect how he con-
ducts himself in his personal 
relationships. However, a fake 
in the anchor chair is far more 
dangerous than a fake at the 
breakfast table. 

Holly Hunter as Jane brings 
an element of feisty quirkiness 
to the exemplary woman of 
the '80s. Jane is so success 
oriented that she schedules 
time each day to be set aside 
for her regular crying jags. A 
self-described "basket-case," 
Jane shows that success does 
not come cheaply - some-

times you have to pay for it 
with your sanity and personal 
life . Hunter is best known to 
film audiences as "Ed," the 
barren cop in "Raising Ari-
zona." 

Albert Brooks (no relation 
to the director) has some of 
the best comedic scenes in the 
film. Aaron's a bright reporter 
on his way down because he 
isn't telegenic. He can write 
the news but he can't read it 
on television due to the fact 
that he breaks out in a tor-
rential flood of sweat. Viewers 
are busy calling in to ask about 
his health rather than paying 
attention to the news that he's 
delivering. 

Brooks the director seems 
to be acknowledging the fact 
that a bit of salesmanship is 
important to anchoring the 
news. Aaron has the same 
expectations for high quality 
news as does Jane, and as such 
seems to be her perfect intel-
lectual partner. But Jane pre-
fers Tom - like the television 
audience she's a sucker for 
charm and good looks. 

William Hurt as Tom is 
perhaps the one actor who is 
hard to believe in his role. 
Surprisingly, Brooks insisted 
that Hurt was crucial to 
making the film. "I held the 
picture for him," Brooks said 
in a prepared statement. Hurt, 
who is usually known for play-
ing complicated characters, is 
hard to buy as a slow-witted, 
dumb blonde. 

Slowing down his speech, 
Hurt struggles over long words 

and is often left tongue-tied. 
This is Hurt's first comedy 
role and one of the few films 
he's been in where he wasn't 
the leading man. 

The true beauty of the film, 
however, rests in Brooks' in-
clusion of telling details. Jane, 
for example, can never quite 
give up her control - she 
even directs New York cabbies 
to the best short cuts in town, 
never relinquishing her role of 
command. Seeing how the 
newscasters sit on the tails of 
their coats to keep a straight 
seam line is one detail which is 
especially nice for its authentic 
. touch. 

Jack Nicholson's cameo per-
formance is alone worth the 
cost of a movie ticket. In his 
role as the reticent head an-
chorman, Nicholson appears 
to be the very definition of 
screen presence. 

The end of the film provides 
the most realistic detail of all, 
however, as Brooks decides 
not to decide who gets who in 
this equilateral love triangle. 
The movie's finish may leave 
the romantic idealists feeling a 
bit let down, but, for a film so 
reliant on realism, a different 
ending would have been the 
true cop-out. 

Aside from some weaknes-
ses in the film's beginning -
Brooks shows the future news 
stars as obnoxious children-
and a problem in the believ-
ability of Hurt's charactet -
"Broadcast News" is a flim 
which deserves the headlines 
it has been receiving .

The San Diego Public 
Theatre and the UCSD 
Theatre department will be 
staging "Sea Marks" on Sat-
urday, Jan . 16 and Sunday, 
Jan. 17 in UCSD's Warren 
Theatre as a special program 
benefiting the Emergency 
Loan Fund for graduate stu-
dents in the UCSD Profes-
sional Theatre Training Pro-
gram. 

Robyn Hunt of the com-
munications department and 
Steve Pearson of the theatre 
department will star in ·the 
restaging of "Sea Marks," a 
1983 San Diego Public 
Theatre hit about the trials of 
a love relationship between 
people with different back-
grounds. 

Though the play takes place 
in the Liverpool and western 
Ireland of 1951 , the barriers 
that are determined to deny 

the love between a Welsh 
woman of means (Hunt), and 
an Irish fisherman (Pearson), 
transcend time and are con-
temporary issues which affect 
relationships today. 

"Sea Maries" will be pre-
sented at UCSD's Warren 
Theatre on Saturday, Jan. 16 
and Sunday, Jan. 17 at 7 pm 
and 9:30 pm nightly . Tickets 
are $5 (general public) and $3 
(students ). 

Tickets may be purchased 
in advance through ARTS TlX

more than Shakespeare in 
exotic costume. Karen Sunde 
and Sho~o Sato have collabo-
rated once more to rework 
Shakespeare's characters and 
themes into a hybrid form. 
Previously, they have adapted 
Othello and Medea. Kabuki 
Macbeth was originally pro-
duced in 1978. 

The Japanese stylization of 
Western classics has at least 

Western classics has at least 
one precursor. Akira Kuro-
sawa recently adapted the 
themes of Shakespeare's King 
Lear to the style of the samu-
rai epic for his popular film,

is experimenting with this 
blended art, as well. 

The impact and color of 
Macbeth can only be magni~ 
fied by passing through the 
lens of Kabuki. Don ' t miss

the classical arts of two civili-
zations from opposite ends of
