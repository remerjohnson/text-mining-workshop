Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced April 27 that he will refuse to sign any 
state budget that does not contain 
increased funding for California’s 

public colleges. The budget will be 
submitted  to the state legislature by 
May 14.

At an April 27 meeting with 
top administrators — including 
UC President Mark G. Yudof — 
Schwarzenegger said he is committed 
to restoring funding to California’s 
public colleges and universities and 
will not sign the new state budget 
unless it does so. 

The promise falls in line with  the 
spending plan Schwarzenegger intro-
duced in January, which proposed 
to return more than $848 million 

to the University of California, the 
California State University system 
and California community colleges 

after a total of $1.7 bil-
lion was cut from their 
budgets last May — of 
this, $237.9 million go 
toward expanded finan-
cial aid. The state short-
fall has led to higher 

student fees, enrollment cutbacks 
and employee furloughs across the 
board.

“[This is] just to let the legisla-
ture know that  — as they deliberate 

the budget and set their priorities 
 — he makes it clear what his prior-
ity is in terms of higher education,” 
education-program budget manager  
for the State Department of Finance 
Jeannie Oropeza said. 

Schwarzenegger’s January pro-
posals included a 2.5-percent fund-
ing increase for the UC system — 
which would restore about $305 mil-
lion in funds cut from the university 
this year, — along with $51.3 million 
meant to preserve open access for an 

Schwarzenegger’s 
proposed budget would 
return $51.3 million to 
UC financial aid.

A.S. Store 
Charter 
Finalized
By Ayelet Bitton
Associate News Editor

After nearly a year of planning, 
the A.S. Council will vote this week 
on a charter for its new enterprise: an 
apparel store scheduled to debut in 
Price Center by Fall Quarter 2010.

Campuswide Senator Tobias 
Haglund said the total budget for the 
store has not been finalized, but esti-
mated that initial operating costs could 
reach $100,000.

“The starting cost will be the largest 
that A.S. will have to invest in the store,” 
Haglund said. “The by-year cost will be 
significantly lower.”

According to Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Peter Benesch, 
rent for the store’s 650-square-foot Price 
Center location — above Price Center 

Theater and directly 
adjacent to Outback 
Adventures — will 
be $1 to $2 per 
square foot, for a 
total cost of $650 to 
$1300 per month. 

Haglund said 
the store is not 
expected to turn a 
profit within its first 
12 months of opera-
tion.

“It’s obviously 
not going to be 
profitable in a year, 
because you’re 
not going to have 
$100,000 in a year,” 

he said. “I mean, you might, but busi-
ness logic would say probably not.”

Benesch agreed.
“The sole purpose of the A.S. store 

is not to make profit  — it is also to 
provide the students with a service,” 
Benesch said. “But not at the expense

Arizona’s newest immigration 
bill — which requires immigrants to 
carry legal documentation on them 
at all times — has caused mass pro-
tests to break out across the country, 
including in San Diego. A number of 
incoming freshmen at the University 
of Arizona have also repealed their 
intent to enroll.

SB 1070, or the “Support Our Law 
Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods 

Act,” was signed into law 
by Arizona Governor 
Jan Brewer on April 
23. Failure to produce 
documentation is now 

a misdemeanor under Arizona state 
law. Proponents of the reform argue 
it was motivated by the current eco-
nomic crisis, as non-taxpayers place a 
financial strain on public services like 
health and education.

The bill stipulates that any ille-
gal immigrant found on Arizona soil 
is trespassing, allowing officers to 
request documentation if given rea-
sonable suspicion that someone is an 
illegal alien. Those who oppose the 
reform contend that it encourages 
racial profiling. 

In the first version of the bill, 
officers would be allowed to demand 
proof of legality upon any “lawful 
contact” — including incidents such 
as a civilian asking an officer for 
directions. However, it was rewrit-
ten on April 30 to stipulate that an 
individual has to first engage in some 
kind of unlawful action — prompting 
a “stop, detain or arrest” — before an 
officer can ask for papers. Executives 
like Brewer said that this clarification 
proves that the intent of the act is not 
to encourage racial profiling.

AS PER USUAL By Dami Lee

TWO COKES SHORT By Sam Pelle

additional 5,121 students in the UC 
or CSU systems who are currently 
not being funded. He also proposed 
that $367 million be returned to the 
CSU system, and $126 million be 
returned to the community-college 
system. However, these numbers are 
not official, as Schwarzenegger has 
not presented his final proposal.

According to Oropeza, 
Schwarzenegger is working with the 
higher-education figureheads at the 
meeting and the State Department 
of Finance, largely, to land on more 
specific numbers for the budget.

The State Department of Finance 
is waiting to receive final total rev-
enue estimates before it determines 
where the funds should be allocat-
ed. Typically, the state treats the UC 
and CSU systems equally in terms of 
monetary support, while the state’s 
community-college system falls 
under Proposition 98 — which guar-
antees them a certain amount of state 
spending, along with public  funding 
for K-12 schools.

“We think [Schwarzenegger is] 
showing greater leadership in this 

issue,” UCOP spokesperson Steve 
Montiel said. “With all that we have 
fought in the budget process, it would 
be a big step forward. It would put us 
on much better footing than we’ve 
been this year.”

Montiel added that, though the 
proposed funding increase would not 
fully cover the system’s budget deficit, 
it would at least ease the financial 
strain of the UC system.

“It would also provide some 
money to make sure at least some 
of the students that are unfunded 
by the state right now get funded,” 
Montiel said. “There currently are 
14,000 students who are not funded 
by state, and the 51.3 million would 
fund some of them, but not all of 
them.”

The proposal is a departure from 
last year, when Schwarzenegger pro-
posed to eliminate the Cal Grant pro-
gram completely. Now, he proposed a 
$101 million increase for Cal Grants 
in his January budget, the state’s main 
financial-aid program for college stu-
dent, said Oropeza.

The meeting marked the 50th 
anniversary of the state’s Master Plan 

for Higher Education, which pro-
vided more financial aid for students 
to enter into California’s higher-edu-
cation systems. 

Attendees also reviewed a report 
by the Public Policy Institute of 
California entitled “Higher Education 
in California,” which stressed the 
importance of in-state enrollment, 
transfer-student enrollment and 
four-year graduation plans. If these 
are not improved, according to the 
report, the state will have one mil-
lion fewer college graduates in the 
workforce than needed by 2025. The 
report was released in light of UC 
Berkeley’s reduction of its freshmen 
class by 1 percent and enrollment of  
15 percent fewer Californians while 
nearly doubling the number of non-
resident students.

According to Oropeza, 
Schwarzenegger agrees with the 
report, and sees higher education 
and the preservation of the Master 
Plan as a priority while maintain-
ing the economic demands of 
California. 

She said that if the legislature 
passes a budget that the governor 

does not approve, he can veto it. 
Schwarzenegger will present his 

official state budget on May 14, at 
which point the state legislature will 
present a budget for him to approve 
and sign.

The legislation has prompted a 
widespread boycott. Organizations 
like the American Immigration 
Lawyers Association — which is 
based in Washington, DC — have 
targeted Arizona’s tourist industry 
by canceling conferences previously 
held in the state. Independent truck-
ers based in Arizona and California 
announced plans for a five-day boy-
cott, during which they will refuse to 
freight goods in or out of the state.

In a letter released on April 29, 
University of Arizona President 
Robert Sheldon announced that 
admits for next year had begun with-
drawing from the school, saying they 
would rather attend institutions out-
side the state than risk being sub-
jected to racial profiling.

“We have already begun to feel 
an impact from SB1070,” Sheldon 
said. “The families of a number of 

out-of-state students — to date all of 
them honors students  — have told 
us that they are changing their plans, 
and will be sending their children to 
universities in other states.”

Additionally, some critics of 
the bill — like Rep. Jose Seranno 
(D-NY) — have called for Major 
League Baseball to relocate the Major 
League All-Star Game from Phoenix 
in response to the new reform, which 
they perceived as discriminatory.

Some UCSD students joined in 
the protests as well. According to A.S. 
Vice President of External Affairs 
Gracelynne West, immigration-rights 
activists-held a candlelight vigil by 
Geisel Library on Monday, just after 
the bill passed. 15 students also trav-
eled to Phoenix in order to take part 
in the May Day protests against the 
new law.

West said there will be a call-in 
day on Wednesday, when organiz-

ers will encourage students to call 
the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-CA) to express their displeasure 
with Arizona’s new immigration law. 
West said she hopes that the effort 
will discourage similar legislation 
from passing in California.

“What happened in Arizona real-
ly sets precedents for what might 
happen in other states, especially 
California,” West said. “The call-in 
… is so she receives the message 
that students at UCSD are really 
unpleased with what’s been hap-
pening in Arizona. We just want to 
make sure that —when immigration 
reform is coming up at the federal 
level — that [Feinstein] really takes 
that into account.”

The Arizona bill will go into full 
effect on August 24, 2010.

of being able to at least maintain itself 
financially, as well as reserve capital, 
should it require any improvements 
in the future and so on.” 

Councilmembers originally pre-
dicted that the store would open last 
December. However, the opening was 
repeatedly pushed back as council-
members had trouble finding informa-
tion to draft a business proposal. 

Benesch said VP Finance and 
Resources-elect Andrew Ang will have 
to invest a large amount of time to open 
the store by fall. 

“Hopefully, if we can get this 
approved ... by the end of the quar-
ter, we can have it open by Fall 
Quarter,” Benesch said. “The next 
Vice President of Finance would have 
to hit the ground running for the 
store to open in the fall.”

Ang said that he is interested in 
gauging student opinion in a follow-

up review of the business next year. 
He said he will try to find out how 
receptive students are to the store, 
alongside its financial figures.

“From what I know, the criteria 
I’ll be looking for is how popular 
I guess you can say it is with the 
general student body, how often it 
is being used and how the student 
organizations take advantage with 
the resources there and how much 
profit it makes,” Ang said.

The store’s charter includes a 
clause calling for a review of the 
enterprise after the first year of oper-
ations, which the council will use 
to review the project and determine 
whether to renew the charter. 

Haglund said the one-year charter 
reapproval plan may prove problem-
atic, as next year’s council will be 
comprised of representatives unfa-
miliar with the project.

“The concern with the one-year 

trial thing is just making sure we like 
it enough to keep it around,” Haglund 
said. “We thought, originally,  that 
would ease people minds about how 
much money it might cost to open 
the store and making sure it’s going 
to be profitable.”

Haglund said the one-year charter 
could prove harmful to the store. 

“We thought that the one-year 
expiration date on it  — and having 
basically to reapprove the charter in 
a year — it would give the council a 
chance to look it over again,” Haglund 
said. “But the reason it might not be 
as good is because you will have one 
council approve the one-year charter 
,and it’s going to be another council 
that [does it] next year. We’re not 
exactly sure how good that is.”

But even if the Governator manages to 
intimidate a couple state representatives into 
backing higher education, it won’t mean as 
much if thousands of students are still unable 
to afford a college education. Though the gov-

ernor’s proposed budget would restore $848 
million to higher public education — a 12-per-
cent increase from last year’s $746 million — it 
comes hand-in-hand with one glaring problem: 
Competitive Cal Grants will be cut entirely for 
the 2010-11 fiscal year. 

Every year, 22,500 Competitive Cal Grants 
are granted — primarily to cover undergraduate 
tuition and expenses for low-income commu-
nity college students. After barely surviving last 
year’s budget cuts, the $35 million program now 
faces elimination altogether.

Three days before the March 4 Day of 

Action protests, Gov. Schwarzenegger promised 
to preserve the Competitive Cal Grant if the 
state saw an increase in tax revenue. Come Tax 
Day, the state collected a 3.9 percent increase in 
tax receipts — enough to fund the competitive 
grant, though apparently still not quite enough 
to have Schwarzenegger make good on his 
word. 

By suspending the Competitive Cal Grant, 
Schwarzenegger is eliminating a primary 
source of scholarship funding for over 20,000

Gov. Schwarzenegger’s refusal to sign the state budget until it restores more funding for higher education might make 
him look like a hero, but with huge Cal-Grant cuts, the rescue plan’s not as foolproof  as he he’d have you believe.

Would You 
Like a Side 
of  Saliva 
With That?
Working in a dining hall for the past two years, I’ve noticed on-campus 
eateries are microcosms of the 
UCSD social scene. 

The frats and sororities travel 
in color-coordinated packs, gnaw-
ing on bacon cheeseburgers. Sports 
teams — decked in blue-and-gold 
sweats and windbreakers — usually 
claim half a dozen adjoined tables 
for their late-night smoothies and 
salads. And then there’s a collection 
of smaller groups — the hipsters, 
the engineers, the international stu-
dents — trickling through the hall 
in twos and threes.

We workers, however, have a 
relatively unchanged interaction 
with all species of student: what 
I like to call an over-the-counter 
relationship. Of course, a physical 
counter does exist between us, but 
I’m referring more to the limitations 
of our association. 

Many times, I have smiled and 
started to wave at a customer in 
Price Center before realizing that 
our conversations have never pro-
gressed beyond the realm of what 
kind of bread they want on their 
sandwich. At this point, I shove my 
hands in my pockets and find relief 
in the fact that they probably don’t 
recognize me without my uniform. 
That, or the layer of grease from the 
fumes of the deep-fryer that covers 
my face during my shift.

Our relationship is distant even 
when we are standing five feet apart 
and I am tending to your cheese-
burger. Every hour on the hour, 
hundreds of freshmen and sopho-
mores are released from the world 
of biochemistry, and immediately 
rush to the nearest dining hall. It’s 
true: Every other underclassman 
has the same gurgling hunger at 
the same time, and the line at the 
grill stretches all the way back to 
Black’s Beach. But as inconvenient 
as this rush of business is, at least it 
spares us the awkward silence that 
descends when there is no chaos or 
competition for our attention. 

When there’s a line, neither the 
worker nor the customer feels any 
responsibility to engage the other. 
When orders and hamburger buns 
are flying through the air, everyone 
is content to just get out of there 
with a half-decent meal and not a 
word edgewise.

At slow moments, when you 
mercifully interrupt my eternal 
boredom of rearranging cheese and 
refilling bins of onions by ordering 
a sandwich, I am initially somewhat 
(pathetically) excited at the chance 
to do something other than think 
about my paper on Marx. Once I 
have started the order, however, we 
are both left with nothing to do but 
stare at each other and listen to the 
patties sizzle. 

As the clock ticks, my blood 
pressure rises. I can feel your hun-
gry eyes, both on me and your 
chicken breast. To avoid some 
insufferable conversation about the 
fickle San Diego weather, I turn my 
back and pretend that poking at

Task Force, A.S. Divestment Resolution

W e have a historic opportu-nity to stop our university from contributing to the 
violation of human rights. This is a 
controversial issue, as all movements 
for social justice are. 

But let us be clear: The contro-
versy surrounding the Peace and 
Neutrality Through UC Divestment 
From U.S. Corporations Profiting 
From Occupation resolution has not 
been created by any student group 
on campus, but by the University 
of California’s decision to invest in 
corporations involved in tremendous 
violations of international law. 

Two of these corporations 
are General Electric and United 
Technologies. They were mentioned 
in the resolution for their involve-
ment in well-documented human-
rights abuses in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. These are not casual 
accusations: These corporations have 
been well-researched, and the fact is 
that our university has invested $136 

million in General Electric and its 
subsidiaries, which contributes to 
the manufacturing and delivery of 
weapons in these occupied territories. 
Because many students have relatives 
who live in occupied territories, such 
investments force them, in effect, to 
fund the bombs that are dropped on 
their families. This is not a choice any 
student should have to make.

Due to the UC system’s involve-
ment, the conflict in Israel and 
Palestine may be a difficult one to 
hear about, but it is not a difficult 
one to understand. The Palestinian 
people suffer from the longest ongo-
ing illegal military occupation in 
the world. No matter how you spin 
it, a military occupation by another 
power implies the curtailment of civil 
liberties and the lack of democracy. 

So why write a resolution that 
references Israel, one might ask? The 
answer is simple. The U.S. gives the 
Israeli government approximately $8 
million a day, and the vast majority 
of that money is spent on its military. 
That sum is more than we give to 
any other country in the world. This 
money is often used for illegal war 
materials such as white phospho-

Historic Opportunity at Hand Resolution Hinders Progress
'DIQD�%DU]LOD\
President, Tritons for Israel

As a student leader and voice of the pro-Israel community on campus, I left the A.S. 
Council meeting last Wednesday at 
a late hour with pride in the council, 
my community and, most impor-
tantly, my Israeli nationality. More 
personally, I left with dismay and 
hopelessness after what I had just 
faced inside the chambers on the 
fourth floor of Price Center East.

The room was divided before the 
open forum even started. With pre-
made posters, shirts and information-
al binders for the A.S. Council, each 
clearly prepared by the student orga-
nizations in disagreement, the meet-
ing looked more like a rowdy soccer 
game crowd than a formal A.S. meet-
ing. When the public forum opened, 
student by student made his or her 
way to the microphone, carefully 
explaining why the proposed resolu-
tion is important or why it is unfair. 
While many students explained the 
rationality behind their arguments — 
backing it up with political sources, 
facts and possible consequences — 
many personal grievances turned 
into what looked to me like a pity 

fight. Each personal story — whether 
in Israel, the West Bank or Gaza — 
tried to be presented as more painful 
than the one before, and therefore 
more persuasive in the discussion of 
whether A.S. Council should vote for 
or against the resolution. 

I found it absolutely dumbfound-
ing that so many people saw the 
resolution as black-or-white. If it 
were passed, the pro-Palestinian 
community would have felt as if all 
its hard work on drafting this bill had 
paid off, but that it had left another 
community angry. If the bill were 
rejected, the pro-Israel community 
would have felt as if its fight to keep 
the community united was a suc-
cess, but stayed apathetic in the cause 
toward helping the suffering of peo-
ple in the region. It was as if I were 
the only one who noticed that we all 
shared one goal: to end suffering on 
both sides of the conflict. 

My main issue with the whole 
resolution and its debate pertains 
exactly to this problem. If we all want 
the same result, why don’t we take 
the same steps to get there? Why 
do we continuously blame one side 
without looking at the big picture?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
As an active UCSD alumnus from 

Revelle College, I am appalled that 
— even after six hours of emotional 
debate Wednesday night — the stu-
dent government still did not have 
the clarity to recognize hatred masked 
in the disguise of divestment, and 
proceeded to reject the proposed anti-
Israel bill outright. The bill violates 
the rights of thousands of UCSD stu-
dents who have no choice but to pay 
their student fees, and they are legally 
entitled to be assured that these man-
datory fees are not used to empower 
the political aims of an extremist and 
hostile group that seeks to promote 
one-sided propaganda against Israel. 
Student fees must be invested in a 
non-discriminatory way without 
regard to the political whims of a block 
of students. This could become a legal 
battle over the rights of all students.

—David Alpern
UCSD alumnus, 1990 

Dear Editor,
The move to pressure the uni-

versity to divest from investments 
in Israel is a shallow, unjust, wrong-
headed strategy that will never result 
in anything positive. Have you stud-
ied the history of the Middle East? 
The first Jewish temple was built 
in Jerusalem centuries before the 
birth of Jesus, and Jews have lived in 
that part of the world continuously 
since. Many Hebrews were forc-
ibly removed from that area by the 
Romans, who sent them throughout 
the empire against their will. Israel 
is the only real democracy in the 

Middle East, and certainly America’s 
only true friend. Since the creation 
of their state by the wisdom and 
agreement of countries at the United 
Nation, Israelis have constantly 
fought wars simply to survive. They 
are not the aggressors in the Middle 
East. They seek only to maintain 
their own small piece of land — a 
place that is sacred to them — and 
to sustain the only Jewish state in the 
world. 

How many Muslim countries 
are there in the world? How many 
Christian? How many Jewish? How is 
it that Palestinian terrorists — whose 
only goal is to destroy Israel and kill 
Jews — have a presumed right to 
land in that part of the world? How is 
it that Jews — who, along with their 
forbearers, have lived there for mil-
lennia — are denied the same right? 

The Jews, in a few decades, have 
made the desert bloom with agricul-
tural productivity, have maintained 
open religious shrines for those of 
every religion to enjoy and built a 
thriving country with blood and 
sweat that poured onto the des-
sert sand. Should they be damned 
and punished for defending their 
tiny piece of turf — and their very 
survival? This is horribly unjust. 
Divestment denies history, denies 
Jews the right to their only homeland 
and in the end, denies justice itself.

UCLA alumnus, 1973

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

‘Please’ and ‘Thank You’ Can Still Make Magic
your food with a spatula somehow 
speeds up the cooking process. 

My eyes frantically search for 
something to restock or some speck 
of dust to wipe from the stack of 
dishes. I turn in pathological circles 
like a drugged show dog until the 
end of this uncomfortable inter-
action comes into sight. When I 
finally hand over your food, I’m so 
glad to have survived the awkward 
encounter that I’m almost relieved 
to be left in the exclusive company 
of cheese and onions — at least for 
the time being.

This is not to say that I don’t 
find you interesting. I just don’t 
know what to say to you, and some-

times it’s best to say nothing at all, 
right? How do you respond when a 
girl tells you she wants exactly two 
slices of tomato and three slices of 
cucumber on her sandwich? I just 
do as she asks and send her on her 
way, hoping this is the worst of her 
obsessive compulsive disorder. 

Similarly, I never ask a certain 
customer why he wears a full busi-
ness suit to every day of class. I 
simply submit to the fact that he 
will one day be a high-ranking CEO 
who summers in the Hamptons, 
while my disintegrating jeans will 
have earned me a cardboard box in 
North Park. 

And, despite my loyalties to my 
employer, I hold my tongue when 

I see the guy who tries to stuff an 
extra egg in his breakfast sandwich 
every morning without an extra 
charge. Nope — I assume that 
when you come into a dining hall, 
you want a quick bite, not advice, 
friendship or moral admonish-
ments. So I just shut up and hand 
over the goods.

But when you do come to 
the counter with a smile on your 
face and start our exchange with 
a “please,” it makes a difference. 
When you treat me like a fellow stu-
dent, not just a lackey who serves 
the daily special, it makes my whole 
shift a little easier. And who knows, 
I just might be less inclined to burn 
your patty.

rus, which was banned by the 1980 
Geneva Convention because it creates 
horrific burns that continue long after 
contact with human flesh. 

After the 23-day Gaza siege last 
year resulted in 1,400 deaths at the 
hands of the Israeli military, institu-
tions such as Amnesty International 
and the Red Cross confirmed that 
white phosphorous bombs were 
indeed used. But this does not do 
much to describe the daily abuses of 
Palestinians in the occupied territo-
ries: Palestinians must endure long 
waits at check points, illegal searches 
and seizures, the demolition of their 
homes, “Israeli only” bypass roads, a 
lack of access to clean water, skyrock-
eting unemployment, a wall separat-
ing farmers from access to their fields 
and the humiliation of another nation 
deciding the budget on everything 
from schools to roads. 

Our Associated Students now have 
the opportunity to stand up against 
the injustice inflicted against the 
Palestinian people, and to demand 
that our university is never involved 
in a single bomb being dropped on a 
fellow human being ever again.

Many will say this resolution is 
biased — and we could not agree 
more. This resolution is biased for 
human rights, justice and equality. It 
is biased against bombs and military 
occupation. Many will also try to 

argue that this resolution is singling 
Israel out, and is therefore anti-Israel. 
However, this bill does not condemn 
one oppressive apartheid regime more 
than any other. If Spain were occupy-
ing Palestine, then this resolution 
would note that Spanish occupation 
and seek to divest from it. 

This week Chris Cruz, chair of 
A.S. Resolution-Writing Committee 
On Peace and Neutrality, will publicly 
meet with the nine-person commit-
tee to discuss whether or not the 
Peace and Neutrality Through UC 
Divestment From U.S. Corporations 
Profiting from Occupation resolution 
will remain the same.

But do not fall victim to the fiction 
that the current military policies of 
the state of Israel represent the Jewish 
identity. There are an increasing num-
ber of Jewish and Israeli voices calling 
for an end to the occupation, including 
organizations such as B’Tselem, Jewish 
Voice for Peace, Meretz-Yachad, Gush 
Shalom and many others. These orga-
nizations see the occupation as both 
morally wrong and harmful to Israeli 
society. These broad coalitions include 
Holocaust survivors, rabbis and many 
other people of conscience who object 
to the terrible indignity that is forced 
upon the Palestinian people by right-
wing extremists in their name.

Barzilay: Resolution Would Promote Anti-Semitic Sentiment
Why is it that in the 21st century, as 
bright individuals who have been 
granted high education and great 
privileges — and at an age where 
everything is possible — why can’t we 
be more creative?

I proposed a solution to this issue. 
But before I get to that, I would like to 
explain how this bill, the A.S. meeting 
and this past week have affected me, 
because, so far, I have only represented 
my pro-Israel community rather than 
myself. Like every student standing in 
line for his or her turn at the podium, 
I wanted my turn.

As an Israeli citizen, I am obligated 
to serve in the Israeli Defense Force. 
This is a law, not a choice. Both my 
parents and grandparents served in 
the IDF, helping build the state of 
Israel, and my best friend currently 
serves as an IDF officer. The proposed 
resolution would have divested from 
a military operation that is part of my 
cultural and national identity. When I 
move to Israel after I graduate, I would 
like to know that my university sup-
ports that decision. 

I also have the right to be safe 
when I live there, and therefore, I have 
the right to be defended by this mili-
tary. While I understand that this may 
be a stretch from the intentions of the 
resolution to divest from weapons of 
war, had it been passed, the associa-
tion between military spending and 

the IDF would have been clear. The 
association between “war crimes” 
and Israeli soldiers would have been 
there. Clearly, this resolution was more 
of a gesture than a step toward any 
improvements in the Middle East, and 
therefore, this gesture would have hurt 
me and my future decisions.

Secondly, the Guardian may think 
it’s an overstatement for me and my 

pro-Israel 
commu-
nity to feel 
“unsafe” 
had the 
A.S. 
Council 
passed 
this biased 
resolu-
tion — but 
the truth 
holds that 

these anti-Israel sentiments across 
international campuses have caused 
much harm to student life. To single 
out the actions of one government has 
a dangerous effect, because of the asso-
ciations people make with its country 
and its people. A UC Berkeley student 
was physically harassed while advocat-
ing for peace in Israel, insisting on the 
number of times the Israeli govern-
ment had made peace negotiations. 
After the divestment resolution debate, 
swastikas were found on the UC Davis 
and UC Berkeley campuses. When 

Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren 
was invited to speak at UC Irvine, he 
was booed off the stage, intruding on 
his freedom of speech. So yes — it 
is a very far cry to say that my com-
munity is in any way being ostracized 
right now. But I value my feelings very 
highly, and I did fear feeling unsafe on 
my campus had the council decided to 
pass this resolution. 

My hopes for the committee, which 
will meet this week to draft a unified 
resolution, is to stay away from divest-
ment talks. Look — everyone arguing 
over this resolution is pro-human 
rights. I am pro-Palestinian in the 
literal sense of that phrase. I recognize 
the suffering of the Palestinian people, 
and I want to help them. Instead of 
divesting from one source and inher-
ently blaming it for its actions, let’s 
invest in a cause we all care about. 
Let’s raise money for Palestinian 
hospitals and schools in Gaza. Let’s 
donate our time and volunteer in the 
region, as many alternative spring 
breaks do. Let’s invest in a company 
that will ensure all people suffering 
in the region will get help. Let’s travel 
to the region together as a unified 
community and see both sides of the 
situation. Leave General Electric out 
of it. If we’re already letting the A.S. 
Council intervene with international 
policy, let’s actually utilize its resources. 
Let’s be wiser, tougher and more open-
minded than ever before this week.

▶ RESOLUTION, MYVT�WHNL��

So Much for Equal Protection
Not only does the Arizona State Senate’s new bill promote blatant racial profiling, it also dam-
ages U.S.-Mexico relations — as if vigilante border 
patrol and the George W. Bush-approved plan to 
build a fence along the southern border hadn’t 
already made us international villains. 

As the federal government attempts to sort out 
the civil-rights disaster that Arizona has created, one 
thing becomes certain: The bill hastily shoves aside 
any attempts to welcome diversity into Arizona’s 
community and spits right-wing propagandism in 
the face of equality. All Arizonans of Latino descent 
— legal citizens or not — can now be pulled aside in 
public places to be manhandled and humiliated by 
cops because of the color of their skin. 

Rather than addressing illegal immigration at 
large — which obviously concerns individuals of all 
ethnicities — this bill unjustly targets our neighbors 
south of the border. Even though the law’s fine print 
also allows Arizona state police to stop and question 
potential Canadian illegal immigrants, realistically, 
police won’t pull over a white civilian and ask to see 
his papers — even if his pronounciation of “about” 
is a little off. 

Though the ink is still drying on SB 1070, it is 
already under full attack and nationwide scrutiny  
— which is, perhaps, the only positive result of its 
existence. If its publicity during the past week has 
worked to build resistance against this bill, maybe it 
can come to serve as a never-again precedent. 

—Margaret Yau
Contributing Writer

Arizona lawmakers recently passed the controversial immigration law SB 1070 — 
allowing police officers to demand residency 
documentation from anyone they “reasonably 
suspect” to be an illegal immigrant — has 
sparked national controversy. 

But, even if it is an extreme step toward the 
right wing, it does have majority opinion on its 
side.

An April 27 poll conducted by Angus 
Reid Public Opinion shows that seven out of 
10 Americans support arresting people who 
can’t prove they are in the U.S. legally. Almost 
two-thirds of those who responded to the poll 
expressed that they believe illegal immigrants 
hurt the country by taking jobs away from 
American workers. 

The bill is a signal that Americans will not 
tolerate illegal immigration. And, according to 
Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), because the federal 
government has done little to help Arizona with 
its immigration problems, the state has been 
forced to take the matter into its own hands.

So, regardless of whether the legislation 
will be found unconstitutional — if not overly 
extreme — at least it will get the attention of the 
federal government, and encourage the White 
House to find a more levelheaded solution 
to our country’s enormous illegal-immigrant 
elephant in the room.

political platform in Israel. Many 
Jewish citizens oppose it. So, if some-
one tells you that he is “for Israel” but 
only represents this side of the contro-
versy, he’s not telling you the full story.

Let this resolution become the 
piece of legislation that defines our 
generation. Let it be known that 
UCSD will not go on one more day 
until the money that is spent toward 
the oppression of Palestine is not in its 
hands any longer. We must remember 
that UC students have a long history of 
standing up for human rights. When 
Nelson Mandela was let out of prison, 
he thanked the UC students for their 
relentless work in divesting from the 
apartheid regime in South Africa.

 We have a legacy; we have a place 
in the struggle that we cannot ignore 
any longer. It is time that the UC 
students take our rightful place in the 
fight for human rights. We can no 
longer sit idly by as our university 
supports the alienation and the rac-
ist treatment of a group of people, 
no matter who they might be. Yes, it 
will mean an uncomfortable conver-
sation about things we’d rather not 
think about — but when has that ever 
stopped us before?

Arizona could’ve been a little less obvious about the thinly veiled racism in its latest 
wave of legislation. 

After passing a bill that allows police to 
detain anyone suspected of being an illegal 
immigrant and making it a crime to even leave 
your house without proof that you’re a legal U.S. 
resident, you’d think lawmakers would lay low 
for a while and hide, for at least a while, behind 
their corrupt desire for insulated state security 
at all costs.

But whatever credibility the law’s support-
ers may have held to their argument — that the 
legislation is simply a way to realistically enforce 
federal law — disintegrated a mere seven days 
after Arizona Governor Jan Brewer passed the 
bill. 

That’s when the state’s superintendent of pub-
lic instruction proposed a law that would ban 
both ethnic-studies courses and teachers with 
accents from English classes.

You’ve got to be in serious denial to claim 
that the two measures aren’t related — not to 
mention outrageously racist. 

Though Brewer the bull hasn’t passed the 
education bill quite yet, it’s likely she will. And 
even if the bill dies, it will still send a clear mes-
sage to the state’s residents: If you’re not white 
and completely assimilated, you should take 
your freedom elsewhere.

After graduating from UCSD in 2007,
ERIK MAKI  launched a hand-crafted longboard 

business — all thanks to a woodshop   
class he took at Mesa Community College.

T hree years after graduating from UCSD, Muir College almunus Erik Maki owns and operates Maki Longboards. But Maki wasn’t transformed into a small-business owner in a 
UCSD economics course — rather, in a woodshop class 
he took his senior year at a local community college. 

As a linguistics major without a clue what to do 
come graduation, Maki decided to try his hand at 
woodworking at Mesa Community College during 
Winter Quarter 2007. 

“It started as a hobby, and the more I did it, I real-
ized that I could do something that not many others 
can — and it’s making other people happy, too,” Maki 
said. “At least for me, I’m an experiential learner; so tak-
ing classes is one thing, but going out and experiencing 
the things that you’re learning have always been more 
important to me. So it wasn’t until I was immersed in 
woodworking that I started to put everything together.”

Immediately after graduating from UCSD, Maki was 
hired by a high-end home-decor company in San Diego, 
where he continued to learn more about woodworking, 
as well as interior design. However, he said he eventu-
ally became frustrated with what he considered to be his 
complete detachment from the creative process.

“I was working 60 hours a week at a cabinet shop, 
working for someone else — and I was making OK

S ixth College sophomore and editor in chief of the brand new No 15 magazine Kevin Nguyen is a walking fashion spread. Last Monday, he 
paired a green-brown plaid shirt and straight-cut 
black jeans with a nose ring, a wrist of silver spiked 
bracelets and a puffed ’80s pompadour. His own 
trend-busting addiction to style — which Nguyen 
says is inspired by fashion giants Lady Gaga and 
Alexander McQueen — motivated him to found No 
15 in February.

Though No 15 isn’t the first fashion magazine 
to grace the UCSD news stands, the staff ’s self-
proclaimed affinity for “raw and raunchy” style has 
helped it stand out as the edgiest of its kind, accord-
ing to founding member and marketing director Liz 
Kim. Unlike Fashion Quarterly — the first UCSD 
publication to model itself after fashion magazines 
like Elle — No 15 takes on more of a minimalist 
approach, focusing less on product and more on 
people, Kim said.

“When you read Vogue or Elle, you always say, 
‘Damn, I wish I had that T-shirt’ or ‘Damn, I wish I 
was skinnier,’” Nguyen said. “But we keep that real 
and raw aspect. We push the people more and give 
them empowerment. We don’t Photoshop people’s 
bodies and put sixpacks in. We’re showing how they 
really are — not some super fantasy that we decide.”

Despite its alleged bareboned approach, A.S. Vice 
President of Finance and Resources Peter Benesch 
said that No 15’s $8,693.43 startup funds — used 
to produce and print 3,000 issue were the highest 
the A.S. Council has ever allocated to a publication.

LAS CUATRO MILPAS

SITESEEN T he eclectic line spilling out of Las Cuarto Milpas at noon — a 20-person sea of Oxford shirts, 
blue jeans, sneakers as puffy as moon 
gear and every getup in between — is 
telling: The food here is fresher than 
spring water. 

It’s also vetted by a daily cascade 
of patrons who pass through its 
doorway from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., 
Monday through Saturday. Its fans are 
so devout in fact, they shuffle inch-
by-inch for upward of 15 minutes in 
pursuit of the rickety register at the 
other end. 

This line, featured prominently in 
every photo ever taken of the estab-
lishment, is as much a part of this 
Barrio Logan landmark as its faded-
forest green awning, turquoise walls, 
wrought-iron windows, plastic trays 
and gingham tabletops. And it’s no 
wonder: Las Cuarto Milpas (literally 
meaning “The Four Cornfields”) has 
been serving the most delicious and 
unpretentious home-style Mexican 
food in San Diego for the last 70-odd 
years.

But good luck finding it, or a spot 
once you’re there: Milpas is the epito-
me of hole-in-the-wall with free-for-
all table space, bare walls (aside from 
some family photos and a restaurant 
review on one) and a menu board that 
looks like it was lifted from an AYSO 
snack bar. 

It’s safe to say that Milpas focuses 
all its energy on its food. It’s a no-
bullshit kind of business, the kind 
where everything is either cooked on 
cast iron frying pans or pan-fried in a 
pool of lard. Since 1933, three genera-
tions of the Estudillo family have been 
running this old-fashioned, cafeteria-

style joint just 
a few blocks 
from Chicano 
Park; and 
since 1933, 

customers have flooded its cramped 
walls during breakfast and lunch hours 
to enjoy the most authentic Mexican 
food north of the border. 

Not much has changed on the 
menu over the last seven decades. It’s 
an indicator that the place still prides 
itself on the perfected basics: Spanish 
rice, stewed pinto beans, tacos (rolled 
or soft-shell), tamales (chicken or 
beef) and chorizo with eggs. The latter 
two items are the most flavor-packed 
of the bunch, and by far the most 
recommended from Milpas’ hardcore 
aficionados. The only downside is that 
they also don’t have much beyond the 
basics — meaning, no salsa, guaca-
mole or carné asada. But for $7 or $8, 
you can stuff yourself with more than 
enough to hold you over for the day 
— including the best handmade flour 
tortillas in San Diego. 

The whole operation does get 
a little greasy, but that’s a given in 
home-style territory. About half of 
Milpas’ patrons take their meals to go, 

so you can do the same, or find a place 
to sit somewhere in the back. Parking 
can also be a problem (seeing how 
streets in Barrio Logan are slimmer 
than most), so making the 20-minute 
caravan via carpool is your best bet; it 
shouldn’t be hard to find a friend will-
ing to swallow something other than 
stir fry for lunch. And when you get 
there, be proud to take your place at 
the end of the line like so many gen-
erations of hungry people before you.

money, but I was not happy at all,” 
Maki said. “I was doing things for 
other people the way that they 
wanted, and felt that I wasn’t getting 
anything out of it. I decided that I was 
ready for something new.”

It was after his departure from 
Beme International that Maki decided 
to settle down in El Segundo, combine 
his experience as a guide for UCSD’s 
Outback Adventures with his new 
skills as a woodworker to create Maki 
Longboards, a company specializing 
in custom wood surf and skateboards. 

Without the money to rent a 
private workspace, Maki converted 
the two-car garage in his El Segundo 
home into a 500-square-foot work-
shop. Stacks of tools along the walls 
and planks of wood stacked every-
where in between left almost no wig-
gle room for creating the boards. And 
aside from cramped quarters, Maki 
faced the more classic obstacles of 
working in a residential area: Within a 
week of setting up shop, Maki’s neigh-
bors had already complained to the 
cops about noise.

Since the rocky start, Maki has hit 
his stride. The woodworker shapes an 
average of four to five boards a week, 
priced between $150 for the 23-inch 
Mini Longboard to $300 for the 
46-inch Classic Cruiser, each taking 
around three days to perfect. 

Maki first started skateboarding 
his freshman year as a way to get to 
class on time. As a longtime avid surf-
er, he eventually envisioned that the 
practical act of skateboarding could 
take on some of the more recreational 
qualities of surfing. He eventually 
got a personal feel for the intimate 
experience that comes with cruising 
around on a longboard across campus 
— a central feeling to his approach in 
shaping his boards. 

“The more I just went from point 
A to point B and just learned how to 
ride, it was fun, — but that’s where 
eventually I wanted a board that 

reflected more of my personality and 
style,” Maki said. “And that’s where 
surfing came in.”

Maki said he shapes his on-land 
longboards to emulate the sensation 
of surfing a long, slow wave — an 
approach he believes many larger 
longboard companies have abandoned 
in prioritizing mass production over 
quality.

“I guess I’m going against the grain 
because most skateboard companies 

are about 
making a ton 
of boards 
that they 
can get out 
there,” Maki 
said. “Every 
board is 
made the 
same way, so 
the way they 
make them 
different 
is by add-
ing colorful 
graphics or 
art. What I’m 
doing is kind 
of taking 
a different 
approach. 
I’m look-
ing to cater 
to surfers 
who want a 

skateboard that looks as nice as their 
surfboard, feels like their surfboard 
and rides like it, too.”

As soon as his business was off the 
ground, Maki returned to his first love 
and began to shape surfboards as well. 
His models are made of Redwood 
Alaia, a wood that, according to Maki, 
was used by ancient Hawaiians to 
construct surfboards long before the 
Western world made contact in 1778. 
The Alaia boards start at roughly $300 
each.

The UCSD graduate said his most 
important job at Maki Longboards is 

creating the individual design of each 
board. 

“I want to be making boards with 
my own two hands that reflect the 
work and the thought that go into 
every board, and no two boards that 
I’ve ever made have been exactly 
alike,” he said. “With the different 
woods I use — the colors and the 
grain patterns — everything is always 
going to be different, and that’s what’s 
so exciting about it. You’ll get these 
grains that will almost give the boards 
a sense of movement. It’s like a skate-
board that looks like a Ferrari just by 
the natural wood itself.”

Locally, he has sold his boards in 
Muir Surf and Skate in Pacific Beach 
(formerly located in Muir College) 
and the Outback Adventures Surf 
Shop in Price Center. Although he 
prefers to take local orders to because 
it allows more customer participa-
tion in the shaping process, Maki’s 
business is earning nationwide popu-
larity. In the last year, Maki entered 
the world of high art by shaping 
boards for restaurant countertops 
and art galleries in Los Angeles. In 
addition, Maki recently received a 
bizarre request from a man in North 
Carolina who wanted a surfboard 
shaped for his English bulldog. 
According to the client, surfing is his 
dog’s No.1 passion in life. 

“But apparently, he hasn’t been 
able to find a board that is durable 
enough for her, because she spends 
most of her time chewing through 
them,” Maki said.

Though he highly prizes the inti-
mate feel of custom handiwork, Maki 
is not above seeking the corporate 
leg-up in a highly competitive market. 
Though individual orders are still 
his main source of income, he said 
he recently began making prototype 
longboards that he hopes to sell to 
major skate shops, along with crafting 
boards specifically for home decor. 
But until his big break, Maki said he’s 
more than happy carving out a living 

from a pastime he loves. 
“I never know how any day is 

going to turn out, but I know that it’s 
going to surprise me in a good way,” 
he said. I’ve always known that there 
was no one perfect job for me, and 

what I was going to be doing had no 
job title — so I’m glad that I get to 
make up my job title as I go.”

The James K. Binder Lectureship in Literature 

In commemoration of the 400th year anniversary of Galileo’s telescope,
the Literature Department is pleased to present...  

MARIO BIAGIOLI 
Inventing Invention:
Galileo’s Telescope Between
Science and Craft

Galileo's name is routinely associated with the telescope, 
and vice versa.  As obvious as this link may sound today, it 
is in fact the result of historical narratives - narratives 
initiated by Galileo himself. He did not inventthe 
telescope but Galileo's telescope. His instrument, Galileo 
intimated, was different from all others because of the 
way it had been invented (through theory, not haphazard 
practice) and because of the unprecedented astronomical 
discoveries it made possible:  the irregularities of the lunar 
surface, the satellites of Jupiter, and many more fixed 
stars. Galileo's claim to the inventorship of the telescope 
was therefore tied - necessarily so - to what he presented 
as the unique features of his instrument and the 
modalities of its invention.  In the Binder Lecture, 
Professor Biagioli will argue that Galileo constructed his 
originality and that of his instruments through narratives 
that were themselves original, in a variety of ways.

&REE�AND�OPEN�TO�THE�PUBLIC�s�&OLLOWED�BY�A�RECEPTION�

Mario Biagioli is Professor of the 
History of Science at Harvard University. 
His work has focused mostly on the place 
of science and discovery in the baroque 

court, and the uses of instruments, 
imaging techniques, and the tactical uses 

of print, spectacle, and display in the 
making of knowledge Galileo Courtier 
(Chicago, 1993 - translated in German, 
Greek, Spanish, and Portuguese) and 

Galileo's Instruments of Credit (Chicago, 
2006)). Along with a standing interest in 

the scientific revolution, he has also 
explored more modern topics, like Nazi 

science, science museums, as well as 
methodological debates concerning 

science studies and their relationship 
with the humanities additional research 
focused on the history and philosophy of 
intellectual property and on the author 

function in science from 1600 to "big 
science." He is now working on Claiming 
the New - a book on intellectual property 

in science. He is also the editor of The 
Science Studies Reader (Routledge, 1998), 

and (with Jessica Riskin) of Nature 
Engaged (Palgrave/McMillan, in press). 
Prior to joining Harvard in 1995, Biagioli 

was a member of the history department 
at UCLA and co-director of the Center for 
Cultural Studies of Science, Technology, 

and Medicine. He has been a visiting 
professor at Stanford, the Ecole des 

Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (Paris), 
and at the University of Aberdeen.

was warranted, as the publication 
strived to be a work of art that 
wasn’t just “thrown away.”

Kim said that No15’s first issue 
is slated to hit racks this Friday 
— delayed from its original May 
1 launch-party release due to the 
printing company’s inability to 
print the issue the Friday prior. 
To spare the 3,000 glossy copies 
from weather damage, the issues 
will only be placed in locales with 
indoor news racks such as Cafe 
Roma, Price Center and the Loft. 
In addition, she said that all con-
tributors, models and launch-party 
attendees will receive a copy of the 
magazine, and spares will be set 
aside for archives. 

According to Nguyen, No 15’s 
articles on various student fashion 
designers emphasize the artists’ 
inspirations and goals, rather than 
their physical work. No 15 will 
primarily feature undergraduate 
photographers and models, with 
an occasional cameo photo shoot 

by a professional volunteer. Their 
debut issue will host a student-
modeled photo essay entitled “We 
the People,” a homage to the varied 
fashion sense of students at UCSD.

“We wanted some self-expres-
sion: people who aren’t afraid to be 
who they are,” Nguyen said. “So we 
study people. We talk to them, see 
what they’re like and try to capture 
everyone’s essence. [During the 
photoshoots], we have them give 
directional and creative input, so 
it’s about them.”

According to Kim, the magazine 
endeavors to push boundaries — 
just like the Federalist Papers 15, 
which invited Americans in the 
1700s to question the Articles of 
Confederation, and authority in 
general.

“No 15 [of the Federalist Papers] 
was an attempt to open people’s 
minds — a breaking away,” Kim 
said. “We’re not breaking away 
from the fashion industry, but we’re 
making people more aware. It also 
happened to coincide with the cam-

pus’s recent racial climate. I think 
[that] rebellious spirit is captured 
in our magazine.”

There’s no doubt about it: No 
15 is shooting for shock and awe. 
Nestled between fashion-designer 
profiles and question-and-answer 
sessions with nonprofit shoe com-
pany TOMS Shoes are full spreads 
of food porn — gourmet food 
served on nude bodies — and 
women with their breasts on full 
display. But for the editors of No 
15, the controversy these risque 
photos might stir on campus is 
a progressive foray into the real 
world.

“I feel like [UCSD students] are 
really isolated and protected,” Kim 
said. “We live in this bubble. We 
want people to go out and see more 
naked people, see things, I don’t 
know. Pop that bubble, get out of 
your comfort zone and see what 
more is out there.”

went out there and saw it as practice, 
trying to focus on our skills to help 
prepare us for regionals.”

The Tritons traveled to 
Northridge for their penultimate 
game of the season, at which they 
lost every singles and doubles match. 
Three Triton singles players lost in 
straight sets: junior Taskeen Bains 
fell 6-2, 6-1; senior Anita Athavale 
fell 6-3, 6-2; and freshman Melissa 
Breisacher fell 6-2, 6-1. Sophomore 
Samantha Yeung took a set off of her 
opponent, but still fell in a decisive 
third set to lose 6-3, 2-6, 6-2.

The doubles teams fared no bet-
ter against the elite D-I competition.  
The dependable tandem of Athavale 
and Breisacher lost 8-4. Bains and 
junior Natalie Varnay paired up to 
little avail, losing 8-4 and the team 
of Yeung and junior Cindy Dao lost 
8-1. 

After its crushing loss to the 
Matadors, UCSD returned home 
and traveled across town to face 
local rivals SDSU — ranked No. 75 
at the national level.

“San Diego State is a really strong 
school,” La Plante said. “We knew 
that we probably weren’t going 
to beat them. It was just fun to 
play a local San Diego team and 
give the girls some tough competi-
tion so they stay focused after the 
Conference Championships.”

The Aztecs made their superior-
ity known, sweeping all the matches 
for a comprehensive 7-0 victory. 

The Triton’s junior Valerie Tang 
— who wasn’t even on the starting 
roster against Cal State Northridge 
— played the most competitive 
match of the day, but still lost 6-4, 
6-3. 

Yeung agreed with LaPlante that 
the tough D-I competition was valu-
able in preparation for playoffs. 

“Division-I is definitely a lot 
tougher, but we had a lot of close 
matches,” Yeung said. “We know that 

both teams, CSUN and SDSU, are 
beatable. We feel ready to face the 
rest of our Division-II competition 
heading into the postseason.”

UCSD will travel to Hawaii the 
week of May 6 to open up the west-
ern regional against postseason 
nemesis Hawaii Pacific University. 
Last year, the Tritons managed a 
5-4 victory over the Sea Warriors 
during the regular season, only 
to be eliminated by them in the 
regional playoffs with a score of 5-3. 
The Tritons will enter their May 
6 encounter against Hawaii Pacific 
motivated by retribution, hoping to 
reverse their losing trend against the 
Sea Warriors who beat UCSD 5-4 
in a closely contested matchup on 
March 25.

Yeung said the Tritons are pre-
paring rigorously for the challenge, 
and remain confident they can exact 
revenge on the team that has repeat-
edly foiled their national title plans.

“We are getting better prepared 
to go to Hawaii, and hopefully 

nationals after that,” Yeung said. 
“We are hydrating more, staying 
more focused the night before and 
trying to get better mentally pre-
pared.” 

In calculating a tactical approach 
against Hawaii Pacific, LaPlante said 
she is urging the girls to focus on 
the individual players they will be 
facing.

While the players focus on 
mental and physical preparation, 
LaPlante is calculating the tactical 
approach the team will adopt against 
Hawaii Pacific, and said she is trying 
to focus the girls’ attention to their 
individual matchups.

“Now that it is the postseason, 
we are trying to get more specific 
with the teams we are going to face,” 
LaPlante said. “Especially with the 
doubles, we are trying to cater our 
formations to help us against the 
competition as we move ahead.”

KEVIN WU/GUARDIAN FILE
The UCSD women’s tennis team will open up the postseason against Hawaii Pacific University 
on May 6. The Sea Warriors beat the Tritons earlier in the season by a narrow 5-4 margin.

students. Reducing scholarships 
is obviously never a good thing — 
especially in financially challenging 
times. But even worse, eliminating 
the Competitive Cal Grant dispropor-
tionately affects community-college 
students by reducing the number of 
recipients by 45 percent, as opposed 
to 16 percent within the UC system. 

Attending community college 
costs approximately $4,500 each year 
— a much more accessible alternative 
to a CSU or UC campus. Community 
colleges provide an invaluable local 
gateway to higher education — one 
that, unprotected by the governor’s 
Tax Day promise, will now be further 
jeopardized. 

According to the governor’s plan, 
restoring funding to higher-education 
institutions will require the Cal Grant 
program be frozen in its current state. 
In the past, Competitive Cal Grant 
payments have increased alongside 
fee increases. From the 2009-10 aca-
demic year to the 2010-11 academic 
year, the 32-percent increase in stu-
dent fees leaves a $3,000 gap that stu-
dents will have to cover without the 
help of Cal Grants. 

While Gov. Schwarzenegger may 
have promised no more future cuts to 
the other parts of the Cal Grant sys-
tem last week, maintaining a fixed rate 
of aid in full knowledge that tuition 
will rise each year is essentially undo-
ing the promise.

We understand that California’s 
budget isn’t an endless well of funds, 
but guaranteeing money to top public 
institutions while cutting from the 
Cal Grant system will discourage 
upward mobility — disproportion-
ately affecting those populations who 
need the opportunity most. In this 
way, California will be taking a more 
privatized and lopsided approach to 
education.

According to the Public Policy 
Institute of California, by 2025, 
California will have one million fewer 

college-educated residents than the 
economy requires. 

To preserve equal access to higher 
education, California needs a more 
sustainable plan. Like it or not, voters 
need to start investing in higher edu-
cation through their taxes. We need 
to reconsider Proposition 13, which 
freezes property taxes at 1 percent — 
and which, as a result, has diminished 
state funding for higher education. 
After the measure passed in 1973, 

tuition and stu-
dent fees have 
steadily risen. 
It’s clearly not 
possible to 
keep property-
tax revenues 
at a static 1 
percent and 
simultaneously 
preserve qual-
ity, accessible 
higher educa-
tion in a failing 
economy.

Another 
way to close 
the gaping 
hole left by 
the Governor’s 

proposal could be to join state grants 
with non-profit scholarships. Instead 
of remaining isolated in the depths of 
the Internet, non-profit organizations’ 
scholarships could be made available 
alongside state grants, garnering pub-
licity while simultaneously ensuring 
low-income students aren’t left out in 
the rain without an umbrella. 

While the governor’s refusal to sign 
the budget until more funds have been 
allocated to California’s public higher-
education system is admirable, pre-
serving a stable middle class and com-
petitive working force is going to take 
a lot more than optimistic rhetoric and 
a stingy signature for the dotted line.

SPORTS� MONDAY, MAY 3, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 15 

out of this one without spitting out at 
least some revealing secrets. That whole 
“Those lowly humans couldn’t possibly 
know what I’m thinking” act? It’s up.

On June 12, 2010, when Group 
C of the 2010 FIFA World Cup kicks 
off at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in 
Rustenburg, South Africa, before a 
scrutinizing world audience, you will 
have two options to choose from: save 
the queen or bless America. BOOM! 
Bet you didn’t see that one coming! 

But in all seriousness — lame his-
torical references aside — the world 
will be keenly watching Group C when 
the United Kingdom, in all its regal 
glory, faces the U.S., its defiant former 
colony. It’s the kind of mouth-watering, 
politically charged showdown that only 
the World Cup can facilitate.

Considering that America leads 
the world in tickets purchased per 
country, and that Britain takes a close 
third (according to FIFA sales data 
from last February), packs of fans 
from both countries will descend upon 
Rustenburg to cheer on their teams 
in a football-pitch reenactment of the 
Revolutionary War. And, just like the 
first time around, the British are the 
heavy favorite. If the Americans are 
to upset the Three Lions, it will take a 
Yankee performance of epic, odds-defy-
ing proportions. Before you overzealous 
American patriots let your delusions 
go any further, let me serve you a harsh 
does of reality: The British will finish 
atop Group C.

The Three Lions enter this year’s 
World Cup highly motivated. Their 
shocking failure to qualify for the 2008 
European Championships was a deep 
embarrassment for the country — espe-
cially since the British press had hyped 
the team as one of the more talented 
crops of players England has ever fea-
tured. However, the hiring of legend-
ary Italian tactician Fabio Capello has 
promptly turned their fortunes around, 
distancing the painful memories of 
2008.

Capello — known as a strict, pater-
nalistic, authoritative figure — immedi-
ately instilled a sense of discipline into 
a team that, though loaded with world-
class talent, lacked cohesion, consis-
tency and a winning mentality. In 2009, 
England breezed through European 
qualifications, exacting revenge against 
Croatia, who ended their Euro 2008 
qualification campaign a year earlier.

With a roster littered in talis-
manic superstars — midfielders Steven 
Gerrard and Frank Lampard and for-
ward Wayne Rooney, to name a few — 
England stands as one of my top three 
favorites to win the entire tournament. 
However, an unimpressive selection of 
goalkeepers, injuries to key role play-
ers, locker-room stability and a horrific 
history in penalty shoot-outs stand 
to derail their World Cup campaign. 
Nonetheless, the English are heavy 
favorites for the semifinals; at the very 
least.

The Bald Eagles, led by head 
coach Bob Bradley, will likely finish as 
runners-up to Capello’s men —enough 
to qualify for the round of sixteen. 
I have always been highly critical of 
U.S. soccer — maybe overly critical. In 
past years, I might have even picked 
Slovenia or Algeria to advance. I’ve 
never understood how our country, 
capable of producing internation-
ally acclaimed talents in seemingly 
all sports but soccer, has historically 
faltered to field a team whose techni-
cal ability matches its athleticism, and 
constantly lost to teams with less physi-
cally imposing, more gifted players. For 
this reason, I never thought of Landon 
Donovan as anything more than a 
mediocre player, hyped simply because 
he was American.

However, over the last year, I have 
been forced to eat my words. Donovan’s 
impressive performance in England 
playing for local Liverpool-based club 
Everton FC with and against the world’s 
best talents has dispelled all the previ-
ous criticisms — of his arrogance, 
overstated abilities and cowardice for 

not testing himself in the high-level 
European leagues —I had levied against 
him. Donovan and Clint Dempsey, who 
plays for London-based club Fulham, 
have both established themselves as 
useful, quality players at the highest 
level. Moreover, the increasing influx 
of talented Americans into the various 
European leagues has had noticeable 
effects on the entire national team: 
players now compete with the belief 
that they can hold their own with the 
best of the best.

Perhaps no better an illustration of 
the U.S. transformation was its improb-
able run to the 2009 Confederations 
Cup Final, during which it beat a com-
petent Egyptian team, scored a historic 
upset over current No. 1 in the world 
Spain and barely lost 3-2 to eventual 
champs Brazil after taking a shocking 
2-0 lead in the final.

While recent American achieve-
ments have certainly raised expecta-
tions, they may set the team up to flop, 
should they fail to scale such unexpect-
ed heights again.

While the England and the U.S. 
are the clear headliners of this group, 
and deservedly so, both teams would 
be foolish to pay as little attention to 
Slovenia and Algeria as I have in this 
column. Led by Dutch master tacti-
cian Guus Hiddink, a coach whose 
credentials are unquestionably master-
ful, the Slovenians beat out a talented, 
heavily favored Russian team (who had 
made the semifinals of the European 
Championships under Hiddink’s guid-
ance only one year prior). Algeria also 
qualified by scoring a surprise upset 
against an able-bodied Egyptian team, 
which had just won the African Cup of

were forced to return the practice 
courts without any 
in-match train-
ing against the 
Highlanders.

Despite being 
denied valuable 
late-season match-
play experience, 
junior captain 
Vince Nguyen said 
the team managed 
to make produc-
tive use of the 
newly-inherited, 
extra practice time.

“[The weath-
er] cleared up in 
San Diego, so we 
went to practice,” 
Nguyen said. “We 
did a lot of con-
ditioning and pre-
pared for our sin-
gles and doubles.”

With under a week before 
the Tritons depart for Hawaii, 

Nguyen said the team has a spe-
cial plan for getting into the right 

mentality heading 
into the post season.

“We’re planning 
on having an inter-
squad match … and 
that usually gets us 
fired up because 
we’re playing each 
other,” Nguyen said. 
“We trash-talk each 
other and try to get 
everyone fired up to 
go to Hawaii.”

The Tritons 
will face the No. 2 
Seasiders, who fin-
ished with an 18-3 
regular season 
record, in the NCAA 
Western Regional 
on May 6 in Laie, 
Hawaii.

Having sealed the conference title with their rousing 6-3 victory over Cal State Stanislaus on April 
17, the women’s tennis team suffered a 
hangover against Division-I opponents 
Cal State Northridge on April 24 and San 
Diego State on April 26; UCSD lost both 
matches 7-0.

Despite the team’s end of the season 
losses, head coach Liz LaPlante said the 
challenging matches were useful in pre-
paring for the postseason race for the 
regional and national titles, which begin 
May 6.  UCSD needs two victories on the 
Hawaiian Islands to claim a spot in 16-team 
Division-II National Championship brack-
et. The Tritons must first navigate their 
match against Hawaii Pacific University, a 
squad that has knocked the Tritons out of 
the playoffs two of the past three seasons.  

With a win, the Tritons would face 
the winner of a matchup between BYU-
Hawaii and California Collegiate Athletic 
Association foe Cal State Stanislaus.   The 
Seasiders shutout the Tritons 9-0 on 
March 24 while UCSD tallied a pair of 
victories against the Warriors during the 
regular season.

While history doesn’t side with the 
Tritons making Nationals — schools from 
the Hawaiian Islands have knocked UCSD 
out of the playoffs for four straight years — 
LaPlante believes the D-I competition was 
good preparation for the playoffs.  

“Every year, I try and schedule some 
good teams to play between conference 
and regionals,” LaPlante said. “A lot of 
times, they wind up being good Division-I 
schools that are tough to beat. We just

UCSD TO FACE BYU-HAWAII FOR THIRD TIME
By Tyler Nelson
Senior Staff Writer

MEN’S TENNIS — Having concluded the regular 
season with a 12-10 overall record and the No. 30 
Division-II national ranking, the Tritons had postured 
themselves for a top-four finish in the Western Region 
— a requisite for postseason qualification — and 
looked likely to secure their eleventh straight NCAA 
Divison-II postseason bid.

According to the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s 
end-of-season poll, UCSD finished the year No. 3 in 
the region — behind Brigham Young University – 
Hawaii and Hawaii Pacific University — and faced a 
potential encounter with No. 2 seed BYU – Hawaii.

However, any definitive strides towards postseason 
play for the Tritons hinged on the NCAA Selection 
Committee’s April 28 announcement of the region’s 
official seeds, at which point the Tritons’ postseason 
opponents would be revealed.

Prior to the announcement, Nguyen said the team 
was focusing more on their improving their own game 
than worrying about their potential opponents.

“We just have to get everyone prepared to play, and 
we really aren’t expecting anything weird to happen,” 
Nguyen said.

On April 28, speculation was confirmed, as UCSD 
was paired against BYU-Hawaii in the No. 2 vs. No. 3 

seed match up. The meeting will mark the third time 
this year the squads will lock horns, and the Tritons 
will hope to reverse their losing fortunes against their 
Hawaiian counterparts. On Feb. 12, the Tritons fell 5-4 
to the Seasiders at the Paseo Tournament, and lost 7-2 
on March 24 in Laie, Hawaii.

However, UCSD will be buoyed by past postseason 
success against BYU-Hawaii, whom they swept 5-0 
in the West Regional in 2008. Nguyen added that the 
Tritons are much improved since the last time the two 
teams crossed paths. 

“We’ve improved since then, but so have they,” 
Nguyen said. “This will be a different match, and 
anything can happen on any given day. We are just 
going to control what we can and hope that everyone 
performs well that day.”

The UCSD men’s tennis team had hoped to use 
their season-ending April 21 road match against 
Division-I, non-conference opponent UC Riverside as 
a chance to perfect their form and technique heading 
into playoffs. That chance never materialized.

The match, originally scheduled to take place in 
February, was postponed due to rainy conditions 
and rescheduled for late April as a prelude to the 
postseason for both squads. However, the Tritons 
again saw foul weather upset their final match, and

Hawaii Pacific University
The Tritons will open up the west-
ern regional against Hawaii Pacific 
University, a familiar postseason 
opponent for UCSD. The Sea Warriors 
have eliminated the Tritons from 

the playoffs two of the past three 
seasons. During the regular 

season, HPU earned a narrow 
5-4 victory over UCSD. The 
Tritons only beat the Sea 
Warriors twice in their last 

eight meetings.

CSU Stanislaus
As a California Collegiate Athletic 
Association foe, the Tritons have 
recorded a pair of victories over the 
Warriors this season. The grandest 
of those victories came on April 17, 

when UCSD earned a convincing 
6-3 win over CSUS to claim 

the conference title for the 
seventh straight season. The 

Tritons are 4-0 against the 
Warriors after the past two 

seasons.

BYU - Hawaii
BYU-Hawaii dominated UCSD in the 
two teams’ regular-season matchup, 
blanking the Tritons 9-0 on March 
24. The Seasiders are the top-ranked 
team in Division-II, with a 28-0 overall 
record. The two teams have only met 

twice in the past three years, 
and BYU-Hawaii claimed 

victories in both. One of 
those victories knocked 
UCSD out of the western 
region in 2008.
