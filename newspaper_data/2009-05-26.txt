UCSD Medical Center Fined 
$25,000 by State Health Dept.
By Sarah Alaoui
Staff Writer

The UCSD Medical Center and 
Scripps Mercy Hospital, along with 11 
other state hospitals, were charged by 
the California Department of Public 
Health last Wednesday of making 
major mistakes that put patients at 
serious risk of injury or death.

Last June, surgeons at the UCSD 
Medical Center forgot to remove a 
sponge during a lumbar surgery, and 
did not take a post-surgery X-ray. 
The sponge was later discovered  
during a routine X-ray appointment 
three months later.

According to a hospital spokes-
person, the patient underwent a 
second surgery, and the object was 
removed without any long-term com-

plications.
The UCSD Medical Center issued 

a statement acknowledging the error, 
turned in a report to the CDPH and 
later released a statement of apology. 

Scripps Mercy Hospital was 
charged with using faulty respira-
tor equipment while transporting a 
male patient for an MRI exam in 
September 2008. The patient expe-
rienced heart failure and was left in 
a vegetative state as a result of the 
mistake.

The two most recent fines were 
filed on April 24, but were not made 
public immediately because of concern 
over the swine-flu outbreak. 

The two San Diego hospitals, both 
located in Hillcrest, were charged the

A.S. Council Fills Roster 
With AVP Appointments

By Nisha Kurani
Staff Writer

After nearly a month in office, the 
new A.S. Council is reaching its full 
form. Councilmembers conducted an 
extensive selection process last week 
that yielded eight of 10 appointments 
to the council’s associate vice president 
positions. 

Responsible for overseeing many 
of the council’s most important opera-
tions — including the management of 
student enterprises and the organiza-
tion of the annual Sun God Festival — 
the 10 AVP appointees are chosen by 
four selection committees, each headed 
by one of the council’s four executives 
and comprised of several campuswide 
senators and the outgoing AVPs.

According to Vice President of 
Student Life Ricsie Hernandez, the 
committees serve as advisory bod-
ies that provide appointment recom-
mendations to the president and three 
vice presidents. The executives submit 
their final decisions to the council for 
approval. 

After a series of application inter-
views last week, Hernandez — along 
with VP of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch, VP of External Affairs 
Gracelynne West and President Utsav 
Gupta — confirmed six  appointments 
at a May 20 meeting.

The tentative appointments of AVP 
of diversity affairs and AVP of concerts 
and events will be finalized at tomor-
row’s council meeting. 

Former Eleanor Revelle College 
Council Chair James Lintern was 
appointed AVP of college affairs, and 

former A.S. Speaker Jordan Taylor was 
appointed AVP of academic affairs. 

“Taylor was the most professional 
and well-versed in what academic 
affairs entails,” Gupta said. 

Former A.S. festivals coordinator 
Alex Bramwell was appointed AVP of 
concerts and events — the position 
responsible for organizing the annual 
Sun God Festival — pending council 
approval. 

Bramwell co-planned this year’s 
festival alongside 2008-09 AVP of 
Concerts and Events Garrett Berg. 
This involved booking bands, per-
forming logistical work and ensur-
ing that staffing levels were adequate. 
Bramwell said he wants to improve 
the popular campuswide festival next 
year by booking a broader range of 
performers.

“[At next year’s Sun God Festival], 
the goal is to have an even more diverse 
lineup that attracts diverse groups of 
people together on campus,” he said. 

Bramwell added that he intends to 
increase advertising for other events 
throughout the year, such as Bear 
Gardens and A.S. Nooners.

Jasmine Phillips was appointed 
AVP of diversity affairs pending coun-
cil approval. She said prior experiences 
such as working with resource centers 
such as the LGBT Center, the Cross-
Cultural Center and other organiza-
tions geared toward assisting under-
represented students have prepared 
her for her new responsibilities. 

“Having these interactions has 
allowed me to have ideas within me 
to try and make change and pro-
mote diversity on campus, and also 
increase the numbers and reaching out 
to underrepresented groups,” Phillips 
said. 

Phillips said she will attempt to 
encourage diversity by directing atten-
tion to cultural groups on campus and

Despite a significant decrease in 
the number of police officers at this 
year’s Sun God Festival, arrest and 
citation levels remained fairly con-
sistent with last year’s, according to 
reports compiled by the UCSD Police 
Department. 

Of the 64 individuals arrested 
on May 15, 54 were taken straight 
to a detoxification facility located 
inside RIMAC Arena. The remaining 
10 arrestees — most of whom were 
arrested because they either refused 
to cooperate with police or were in 
possession of drugs — were taken 

to jail, according to UCSD Police 
Department Sergeant Doug O’Dell. 

The number of uniformed officers 
at the festival dropped by roughly 
36 percent from last year. While 77 
officers patrolled campus during the 
2008 festival, there were only 45 offi-
cers at this year’s event, due in part 
to last-minute cancellations by offi-

cers unable to commit to their shifts, 
O’Dell said. 

At last year’s festival, 57 individu-
als were taken into police custody. 
O’Dell said that, as in previous years, 
the majority of the arrests made at 
the 2009 event had to do with alcohol

UCSD Extension announced the 
10 most popular career options for 
college graduates in a study last 
week. Game development — usual-
ly those played online and on mobile 
phones — topped the list, followed 
by data mining and embedded engi-
neering. 

The list finishes with feature writ-
ing for the Web, Geriatric health-
care, mobile media — especially 
graphic designers with animation 
experience — occupational health 
and safety, specialized Spanish/
English translation in fields such as 
law, medicine and business, and 
sustainable business practices.

The study was conducted by 
the university’s continuing education 
academic directors based on enroll-
ment trends, an analysis of national 
employment statistics and discus-
sions with more than 750 business 
and community advisors. 

Data mining has become more 
prevalent as more businesses 
search for ways to increase rev-

enues and decrease expenses. 
Miners are responsible for collect-
ing information about service and 
product users to help businesses 
and organizations cater to their cus-
tomers. 

 Embedded engineering — such 
as software design and develop-
ment — came in at number two 
in a separate survey published by 
Jobfox of the top 20 most reces-
sion-proof professions. 

Computer software engineering 
isd expected to be among the fast-
est-growing occupations through 
2016, according to the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics. 

The bureau also said employ-
ment of occupational health and 
safety specialists and technicians is 
expected to increase 9 percent by 
2016, though U.S. unemployment 
has reached a 25-year high. 

Don E. Wayne, chair of the lit-
erature department, was appointed 
Revelle College provost last week. 

Wayne will replace current provost 
Daniel Wulbert at the beginning of 
July. 

Wayne taught at Ohio State 
University before joining the UCSD 
faculty in 1975. He received his 
Ph.D. in literature from UCSD and 
served as the department’s chair for 
the past four years. 

Wayne has received sev-
eral fellowships and grants from 
the Guggenheim Foundation, 
the National Endowment for the 
Humanities, the American Council of 
Learned Societies, the Huntington 
Library and the William Andrews 
Clark Memorial Library. His research 
interests include early modern stud-
ies, U.S. culture from 1945 to 1960, 
history of literary studies in educa-
tion, critical theory and interdisci-
plinary studies. 

“Professor Wayne’s adminis-
trative and academic accomplish-
ments and his commitment to 
undergraduate education make 
him exceptionally well-qualified to 
provide leadership as provost of 
Revelle College,” Paul W. Drake, 
senior vice chancellor of academic 
affairs, said in a statement. “I’m 

delighted that he has accepted this 
important and challenging position.”

Wayne was chosen by a search 
committee chaired by Barbara 
Sawrey, associate vice chancellor of 
undergraduate education. 

“The committee was impressed 
with Professor Wayne’s ... deep 
commitment to enhancing the diver-
sity of the campus,” Sawrey said in 
a statement. 

Wayne is also known for his 
work on relations between poetry 
and early modern science with par-
ticular emphasis on Ben Jonson 
and Francis Bacon. He received 
his bachelor’s degree from Queens 
College in New York. Wayne com-
pleted his graduate education at 
Hunter College, also in New York, 
and the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en 
Sciences Sociales in Paris. 

“I’m particularly excited about 
serving as provost of Revelle 
College because it was the first of 
[UCSD’s] six colleges, and as such, 
its curriculum embodies many of 
the educational principles and 
ideas of the educational leaders 
who planned UCSD,” Wayne said 
in a statement.

consumption and public intoxication.
“Just about every arrest we made 

was somehow alcohol-related,” he 
said. “Just based on that, I think you 
could draw the conclusion that if 
there was less alcohol use, there would 
be less citations and there would be 
less arrests.”

In addition, 94 citations were 
issued throughout the day, slightly 
down from the 105 citations issued at 
the 2008 festival.

According to O’Dell, the major-
ity of the arrests 
occurred during the 
event’s later hours, a 
variation from pre-
vious years in which 
arrests were distrib-
uted more equally 
throughout the day. 

“We didn’t make 
our first arrest until 
4 p.m.,” O’Dell said. 
“It was unusual. 
From 4 p.m. on, we 
were really busy. I 
don’t know if that’s an anomaly or if 
that’s going to hold true for future fes-
tivals. We’ll just have to wait and see.”

In addition to the UCSD police 
officers present at the event, the UC 
Riverside, UC Irvine and San Diego 
State University police departments 
also supplied personnel.

According to Associate Vice 
President of Concerts and Events 
Garrett Berg, the police presence at 
the festival was planned so that fewer 
officers would be on patrol during the 
daylight hours, while more were pres-
ent after dark. 

“Last year, when a lot of students 
arrived at the festival, their biggest 
complaint was that there were so 
many cops at RIMAC,” Berg said. 
“We really wanted to strive to get rid 

of that feeling altogether.”
O’Dell said the redistribution of 

officers provided for a more efficient 
use of security resources.

“We staffed heavy during the 
times where we traditionally had the 
highest level of activity and staffed 
lighter during the times when we 
traditionally had less activity,” he said. 
“In other words, we tried to staff 
more appropriately to the needs of 
the festival.”

Arrests at the 2008 and 2009 fes-
tivals were significantly fewer than 

those recorded at 
the 2007 festival, 
where police issued 
285 citations and 
took 76 individuals 
into custody. 

Following the 
2007  Sun God 
Festival, admin-
istrators insisted 
on creating a safer 
event. Its new for-
mat localizes all the 
day’s activities on 

to RIMAC Field, coralling festivalgo-
ers in a single area. 

Berg said the relatively low arrest 
levels reported in 2008 and 2009 
demonstrate the festival’s potential for 
continued growth. 

“A lot of the fears that came with 
the old format are gone now,” Berg 
said. “This year we had a much big-
ger crowd, much bigger acts   — big-
ger excitement all around. That the 
[arrest] numbers stayed the same [as 
last year] basically shows that the 
festival can continue to grow and con-
tinue to be really exciting without any 
of the major problems that haunted us 
in the past.”

maximum fine of $25,000 for the sec-
ond time since the state began assess-
ing their operations in 2007.

The hospitals were fined under a 
2006 disclosure law implemented to 
inform the public about “immedi-
ate jeopardy” incidents — situations 
in which the hospital’s noncompli-
ance with one or more requirements 
of licensure has caused preventable 
death or serious injury to a patient. 

UCSD Medical Center’s first vio-
lation occurred in August 2007, when 
the high-risk medication Flolan, used 
for pulmonary hypertension, was 
improperly administered to a patient 

with high blood pressure. 
The hospital self-reported the inci-

dent and the CDPH ordered the hos-
pital to turn in a plan of action that 
would prevent similar incidents con-
cerning Flolan in the future.

The first violation at Scripps 
Mercury Hospital occured in February 
2008, when staff failed to administer 
the saline solution ordered by an emer-
gency room doctor to a woman after 
tests showed that her sodium levels 
were critically low. The woman died 
several hours later. 

Seven San Diego hospitals have 
been fined a total of 12 times since the 
CDPH started issuing the violations 

in 2007.
Eleven additional California 

hospitals have received violation 
fines: Brotman Medical Center, 
Clovis Community Medical Center, 
Hollywood Presbyterian Medical 
Center, John Muir Medical Center, 
Los Angeles County Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center, Saint Agnes Medical 
Center, Saint Francis Medical Center, 
St. Jude Medical Center, UC Irvine 
Medical Center, UC San Francisco 
Medical Center and Whittier Hospital 
Medical Center.

pushing for college-specific cultural 
events to go campuswide. 

New AVP of Student Organizations 
Andrew Ang said he will pursue the 
similar goal of raising cultural aware-
ness, assisting student groups in reserv-
ing spots for events in Mandeville 
Auditorium. 

According to Ang, many cultural 
organizations are forced to perform 
their shows off campus due to difficul-
ties securing the auditorium. Ang said 
allowing these organizations to utilize 
the space would save student organiza-
tions thousands of dollars in booking 
fees and transportation.

Benesch, whose office includes the 
AVP of enterprise operations and the 
AVP of student services, said the stu-
dents appointed to these positions were 
selected partly based on their aware-
ness of the offices’ responsibilities. 

“All had experience in the field that 
I had appointed them to,” Benesch said. 
“They had detailed knowledge on what 
each position entailed, and formulated 
plans on what they planned to do.”

According to Benesch, AVP of 
Enterprise Operations Rishi Ghosh 

was appointed because he had experi-
ence running his own business and 
was prepared with a structured plan 
for his new office. 

“[Ghosh] has worked with admin-
istration, has the political background 
necessary to fulfill the job and has 

worked with activist movements such 
as the green movement,” Benesch said. 

Ghosh will oversee such A.S. enter-
prises as the Grove Caffe, A.S. Lecture 
Notes and Soft Reserves. He said he 
will attempt to micromanage the enter-
prises, including their staff and manag-

ers — transforming the position from 
a monitoring role to a hands-on one. 

“A short-term goal is to stabilize 
enterprises that haven’t been doing 
well, mainly the Grove,” Ghosh said. 
“In the long term, [I want to] boost 
profitability without significantly rais-
ing prices for any of the services or 
enterprises.” 

Student services operated by the 
council — including KSDT Radio, 
Safe Ride and the A.S. Graphic Studio 
— will be managed by new AVP of 
Student Services Meredith Madnick. 

Aries Yumul was appointed as AVP 
of local affairs. According to West, 
Yumul was chosen based on involve-
ment with American-Indian tribes 
in San Diego County and passionate, 
clear plans about what he wanted to do 
in the position. 

“He bridges the San Diego commu-
nity with UCSD and acts as a liason,” 
West said. 

The AVP of athletic relations and 
AVP of student advocacy have yet to 
be appointed.
