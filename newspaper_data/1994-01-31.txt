RALLY: Approximately 100 UCSD 
students protest fee increases on 
Thursday night; McCloskey calls 
on students to 'blackmail' regents 
By Jonna Palmer 
Associated Students 

In the wake of the fee increases approved by 
the Board of Regents earlier this month, approxi-
mately 100 protesters attended a candlelight vigi I 
at the Price Center last Thursday night to protest 
the hikes. 

In order to draw a larger crowd, the protest 
was held between the 9 and II :30 p.m. showings 
of Dazed and Confused. Rally organizers de-
scribed the event as "the last time to mourn" the 
$620'hike for the 1994-95 school year. 

Organizers Jenner McCloskey and Nick 
Endres said that the vigil was merely a spring-
board for students to become involved in a cam-
paign that will attempt to gain more funding for 
higher education from both the state and federal 
governments. Students involved with the cam-
paign will also try to pass an initiative which 
would reform the way in which the UC Regents 
are appointed. 

McCloskey said that she was pleased with the 
turnout at the vigil. "I think it was an incredible. 
incredible show of [student] force at UCSD," 
McCloskey uid. 

Many students spoke at the rally, voicing their 
opposition to the fee hikes. While some in atten-
dance criticized the speakers for frequently del v-
in, into profanity, others thoulht the villi wais a 
positive fU'St step. 

"I've never been one to want to contain stu-
dent an,.." Endres said. "I think it was very 
healthy."

REVIEW: Restructuring 
effOits by university 
officials could lead to 
switch to semester 
system, less time to 
obtain degree 
By Philip Michaels 
News Editor 

As a result of the continuing 
budget constraints fac ing the Uni-
versity of California, UC ofticials 
are considering maki ng long-term 
changes in the university' s aca-
demic program .which could sub-
stantially alter the way students 
obtain an education . 

In an effort to reduce costs and 
allow students to attain a degree 
faster, administrators at the UC 
Office of the President are review-
ing changes to the curriculum 
which could include switching all 
nine campuses to a semester sys-
tem, moving to year-round opera-
tion, initiating a three-year degree 
program and lengthening the in-
structional day or week to offer 
more courses in the regular cur-
riculum. 

In a speech to the UC Board of 
Regents earlier this month, UC 
Provost Walter E. Massey said 
that the decline in state funding is 
forcing the university to reassess 
its academic priorities in order to 
maximize efficiency in providing 
an education to UC students. 

"We want to reach a broad-
based agreement on the principles 
and priorities that should guide 
the long-term perspective and to 
make that part of the conscious-
ness and the daily life on each 
campus," Massey said. 

The restructuri ng process is still 
in the early planning stages, ac-
cording to UC spokesman Mike 
Alva. "We're at an active stage on 
this, but we're not at a stage ... 
where we're making proposals," 
he said. 

"We're not operating under any 
set date, but we would like to get 
done as soon as possible," Alv2 
added. 

The proposed changes in the 
UC's leademic program are part 
of a continuin, restructuring of 
the university in an attempt to adapt 
to dwindling state funding. In the 
last few years, the university has 
discontinued and consolidated 
some leademic departments. and 
the ntoe campuses have begun to 
share resoun:es because of the scar-
city in fundin,.

Engineen Release 
Earthquake Rndings 
REPORT: UCSD professors blame inadequate 
flexibility in support columns for temblor damage 
ByD.....,K. Lew 
Guardian Reporter 

In their flfst public release of 
research results, structural engi-
neers from UCSD and Caltrans 
said Thursday that inadequate flex-
ibility in freeway support columns 
was the main cause of bridge col-
lapses in the Jan. 17 Los Angeles 
eanhquake. 

As opposed to longer freeway 
columns which are more flexible, 
short freeway columns are stiffer 
and attract more seismic forces, 
according to Nisei Priestley, struc-
tural engineering professor and c0-
director of UCSD's Charles Lee 
Powell Structural Research Lab0-
ratories. The shorter columris, 
which are only built to withstand 
three to four inches of displace-
ment, or horizontal movement, 
"col1apsed in a brittle fashion" af-
ter they moved approximately 
Winches, Priestley said. 

The failed supports then caused 
portions of freeway bridges to give 
way, "releasing an enormous 
amount of energy" that the re-
maining, longer columns were 
unable to support. 

Priestley added that the strength 
of columns and span-length of me-
way bridges were not the problem. 
"An earthquake requires structures 
to go through displacements. 
Forces are generated in conse-
quence to stiffness, and shorter 
columns attract more seismic 
force. You have to make them as 
flG.ible as you possibly can," 
Priestly said. 

He also cited unpredictable 
ground conditions as a potential 
problem. Excavation of dirt dur-
ing construction of the columns 
makes soil unpredictably soft, re-
sulting in different effects during 
an earthquake. 

Structural engineers asreed that 
damages from the nine majorstruc-

tures were predictable because 
they had not been retrofitted. The 
114 retrofitted bridges in the af-
fected areas sustained insignifi-
cant damage. 

All but one of the nine struc-
turesdestroyedintheJan.17earth-
quake were scheduled to be retro-
fined in the coming months. 

Retrofitting consists of casing 
two semicircular, tbree-eighth inch 
to five-eightb inch "steel jackets" 
around an existing column. Dur-
ing an earthquake, "tensions de-
velop within the jacket, which in 
itself provides a clamping force 
which holds the concrete together," 
PriestJey said. 

According to Brian Maroney, 
Caltrans' senior brid,e engineer, 
retrofitting has been a priority since 
the 1989 Lorna Prieta quake in 
San Francisco. However, Maroney 
does not expect a major increase 
in the number of structures to be 
retrofitted. 

"Evaluating a structure [to be 
retrofitted] is not quite as iimpJe 
as going down achecklist and say-
ing this is safe. First. you have to 
evaluate threat. Someone has to 
go out and do a hazard study, iden-
tify potential fault activity, con-
sider distances and vulnerabiJity 
of the structure," he said. 

Besides steel jacketing, plans 
are also being made to build new 
bridges from composite materi-
als. 

Maroney praised the Powe)) 
Laboratory for its efforts in retro-
fitting and its accessibility. ''TIle 
impact this facility has had on 
earthquake bridge engineering is 
immeasurable. Caltrans' first re-
search contract went to this facil-
ity," Maroney said. I 

"There have been tim~ where 
Caltrans has implemente;d infor-
mation from this facility within

ERRATA 
In the article "Eight Student Organizations May Lose Fun<1ing" (Jan. 20), the Guordian incorrectly 

reported that student organizations are eligible for funding if they meet both sets of criteria outline in list 
"B" and list "C." The article should have said that an orsanization is ineligible for funding ifit meets one 
or more of the criteria on list "B." The GlMJrdion reJrelS the enor. 

\ 
"The Triumph of Liberalism, Revisited," (Jan. 24) as printed implied that progress toward greater 

democracy or better human rights protection has occw:red in Mexico. This was due to a miscommuni-
cation during editing. //

VIGIL: Rally 
organizer wants to 
blackmail regents 
ContInued from .,... 1 
as forcefully as others will, but 
they were there on behalf of those 
students affected by the fee hikes. 
"[I'm here] to show support for 
all of the people who cannot af-
ford to go to school anymore," 
said vigil attendee Doug Cronyn. 

Jay Chevalier, one of the event's 
organizers, said that he has been 
homeless three times because he 
was unable to afford the rising 
costs of attending the university. 
He encouraged students to take 
action to help solve budgetary 
problems. 

"Regents are not dedicated to 
..education. That's the problem in 
the state of California," Chevalier 
~ded. 

A, few of the observers were 
more critical of the rally, how-
ever. Several students supported 
the idea of regent reform but 
wanted more facts from the speak-
ers. Others thought that the ap-
proach was inappropriate. 

"If you're going to try to con-
vince America [of the importance 
of education), don't come across 
as a bunch of sloppy kids trying to 
revive the '60s. It's a good effort, 
Ijust think they're using the wrong 
means," said Muir College stu-
dent Brian Sanders. 

Protesters at the vigil were sur-
rounded by posters and signs de-
tailing the budget crisis, outlining 
the effects of budget cuts at UCSD 
and advertising slogans such as, 
"When the force of logic fails, the 
logic of force must prevail," and 

"F~ .hik~ syck,:' '" 
Protest organizers also hung a 

regent in effigy from the Price 
Center marquee. 

During the vigil, organizers 
solicited the names and phone 
numbers of those students inter-
ested in continuing the campaign 
through letter-writing and other 
creative means. 

McCloskey iUustrated her in-
terest in coming up with new ways 
to influence the regents to focus 
more on student needs by saying 
that she "wants each UC to take 
one or two regents and do some 
investigating to find one or two 
skeletons in each of their closets 
and do a little bJackmailing or 
something." 

After the vigil, McCloskey re-
iterated her stance on blackmail-
ing the regents. 

The UCSD Guardian 

KFMB Reporter .eM Soh interviews a student at tile vICIl. 
"We've been phone calling and 

writing letters, working through 
the system and that has to continue 
for students to be effective, but 
these crazy times demand some 
crazy alternatives," McCloskey 
said. 

It's time to start considering 

different tacts in order to get some 
accountability from the people 
making the decisions," she added. 

MCcloskey said that a plan-
ning meeting wi II be held on Tues-
day night at 6 p.m. in the Price 
Center confrence room, above the 
theatre.

W HATCAUSFS AIDS?Thebulkof AIDS study cenlerson the 1I'IInS-mission of a retrovirus called fUV. Researchers tell us that fUV compromises the human immune 
system, allowing ailments like Kaposi's Sar-
coma and pneumonia to invade the body, result-
ing in death. This is only theory. 

In the last few years, another major theory 
has emerged which discounts the role of fUV 
and focuses instead on other agents that compro-
mise the human immune system. Do you know 
what this theory is? Do you even know about the 
HIV theory, the one supported by the American 
government and the medical research and phar-

maceutica� industries? 
Chances are, you don't. You might know a 

few catch slogans: use a condom and practice 
safer sex . .. don't share needles ... abstinence is 
the only safe sex ... use discretion with regard to 
sexual partners ... get tested regularly for HIV. 
You might even know some half-truthsl slan-
ders! buUshit: a gay flight anendant brought 
AIDS to the United States; AZT will prolong an 
HIV patient's life; only gays and drug users get 

- AIDS, etc. 
The fact is, most people just don't know 

enough about AIDS, and a lot of their knowl-
edge is either false or spotty. Even worse, there's 
a growing body of evidence that indicates that 
the initial HIV/AIDS hypothesis is flawed and 
that the medical industry (which has profited 
enormously via AIDS hype and hysteria) has 
tried to shut out the alternative theory. What is 
even more outrageous is that some AIDS advo-
cacy groups may have encouraged this - in part 

• TO . • Y 

Deeth Rat .. 
In 1987. over 13.000 
people died of AIDS in 
the United States. In 
1993. the death toll 
was more than three 

times as high. Fatalities are expected to 
continue growing. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Alternative theories of AIDS, though promising, have been 
blacklisted by the scientific establishment and medical industry 

WHAT REALLY 
CAUSES IT? 
because the second hypothesis places certain 
segments of society in a very bad light and might 
encourage the moral majority to snuff out future 
AIDS research funding. 

The HIV equals AIDS theory states that if a 
person is infected with HIV, at some later date 
the H1V retrovirus will bring about an immuno-
deficiency syndrome. The problem is that no-
body has been able to link the two. Right now 
there are thousands of chimpanzees running 
around with HIV, none of which have devel-
oped AIDS. I~ the United States alone, there are 

over 5,000 people with AIDS who have not yet 
shown a trace of HIY in their blood. Further-
more, thousands more have died from AIDS 
withoutHIYhavingbeendetectedintheirblood. 

A major alternative hypothesis was devel-
oped. in part, by UC Berkeley researcher Peter 
Duesberg. a pioneer in molecular biology who 
developed much of the early retrovirus theory. 
Duesberg believes that a coalition of different 
viruses, along with environmental factors, act in 
tandem to compromise the human immune de-
ficiency system. Alone, HIV will not cause 
AIDS. In fact, Duesberg argues that HIV is not 
all that dangerous by itself. He points out that 
HIV has been with us for some time without dire 
consequences such as AIDS. 

Monday, January 31,1994 

Researchers have traced HIV -tainted blood 
to 1959. Others have found AIDS-like symp-
toms as far back as the 1800s in scattered medi-
cal journals. In fact, Duesberg believes that HIV 
may be older than the human race, a virus that. 
like other major viruses, mutates and adapts to 
changing host biologies. 

Duesberg's theory is controversial because it 
lays much of the blame for AIDS on "environ-
mental co-factors" such as malnutrition and 
heavy. consistent drug use. He also points the 
finger at AZf, saying that the AIDS scare has 
induced otherwise healthy indi viduals to use the 
drug, effectively killing offheaJthy cells ~it also 
blocks translation ofDNA into RNA), allowing 
infected cells to prevail. 

Originally, people with HlV were expected 
to die within five years. Then the estimates went 
to 10. Now they're at 15. According to believers 
of this new theory healthy people with HIV 
shou Id Ii ve normal Ii ves. 

This opens the question of what specifically 
causes AIDS. if not HIY. Under Duesberg's 
theory, there are two main cause~. First, there is 
the transmission of viruses and retroviruses via 
intravenous drug use and sexuai coniac!. Every 
time a person contract a virus, her immune 
system must fight it. 

Practicing indiscriminate, multiple-partner, 
unsafe sex can result in numerous cases of 
sexually transmined disea.c;es (STDs). Let's say 
you had gonorrhea once, then you "catch" it 
again. You have the same symptoms, but essen-
tially it's another bacterium. In the same way 
that bacteria and viruses mutate which allows

CIffi CAFE SHOULD BE GIVEN BACK TO UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY 
Editor: 

For the past seven months, I have 
fought to gain access to the CM Caf~ 
for the students of UCSD. The rising 
cost of education, exemplified by fee 
increases, makes it imperative that 
registered students of UCSD have 
priority access to all job opportunities 
on campus. 

The first struggle was within the 
~ Caf~ itself. It is no secret that the 
C~ is misnwJaged by a motley group 
of non-students and hangers-on. It is 
open asa restaurantonIy two hours per 
week! Anyone with vision would find 
a great deal of untapped potential. 

In light of the Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) and its legal 
obligations. ] attempted to make 
changes at the CIII! that would not only 
briog the MOU to life, but would add a 
vibrant new sectorto UCSD: a student-
run vegetarian restaurant that offers 
jobs and scholarship money to needful 
students. Further. I offer the valuable 
combination of the restaurant with the 
charity Food For Thought, an organi-
zation which prepares 500 meals a day 
in Balboa Park. 

It doesn', take brilliance to realize 
that this combination is the very for-
mula that would attract money from 
the Clinton Administration, possibly 
millions, as a student jobs program. 
Rather than realize the utility of this 
program and the huge benefits that it 
would bring to the university and the 
students, the members of the C~ 
have engaged in damage control and 
spin doctoring, enlisting the support 
of the Food Co-op and co-op attorney 
loUie Cohen. Her accusatory letter 

contained all sorts of legal threats to 
fon:e me to desist from revealing the 
truth about the CM to the students of 
UCSD. Attacks in the press began 
along the same lines. 

Carla Tesak. president of the 
ASUCSD, calls Food For Thought W1 
"interesting conversation piece." How 
absurd! A charity starting with no 
assets. run by the homeless them-
selves, that costs the taxpayer noth-
ing, is reduced to an "interesting c0n-
versation piece?" 

Whether she knows it or IKlt, be-
cause of the success of Food For 
Thought, I have been invited by San 
Diego's Homeless Task Force Coor-
dinator. Tom Leslie, to implement the 
first of eight city-wide shelters for the 
homeless. As a conversation piece, it 
speaks in volume. 

It is unfortunate that the cacophony 
of personal attacks against me. based 
on both ignorance and self-interest, 
clouds the debate on what is a sincere 
effort to improve both the student life 
ofUCSD and the plightofSan Diego's 
homeless. The ASUCSD should ex-
ercise both the spirit and the letter of 
the MOU, in spite of the efforts of the 
CM collective. for the greater good of 
the campus community. 

I invite those who make a sport of 
trashing my character to join me in 
this movement and become part of the 
solution. This is a clarion call to all 
students to demand public disclosure 
about all issues swrounding the C~ 
Caf~. The jobs of students hang in the 
balance.

CoInmentary Full of 
Factual Errors 
Editor: 

In response to Daniel 1. Hurst' s 
Jan. 20th article, "Deconstructing 
Christ," I would like to clarify a few 
misconceptions. I agree with the con-
clusion that this world wouJd be a 
bener place if we followed the golden 
rule, but the article contains many 
serious historical errors. 

First. the article states that the Dead 
Sea Scrolls "seem to confirm the truth 
that there was a Jesus Christ." Noth-
ing could be further from the truth! 
The historical value of the Dead Sea 
Scrolls lies in their confirmation of 
the accuracy of the Old Testament 
manuscripts. The Dead Sea Scrolls 
make no mentionofJesus (contrary to

the anicle). Even the Christians know 
this. The author failed to mention that 
historical confirmation forthe person 
of Christ can, however, be found in 
the writings of three Roman histori-
ans: Tacitus, Seutonius. and Lucean; 
the Jewish Talmud and the Jewish 
historian, Josephus. All speak ofJesus, 
his miracles and his disciples - yet 
all were by no means friendly toward 
Christianity 

The article blatantly misquotes the 
Bible as well. The Bible makes no 
mention of "Melchisedech" (sic) who 
lived to be 980 years old. Perhaps the 
author had in mind Methuselah, who 
lived to be 969 (Genesis 5:27). The 
Bible says nothing about the Israelites 
wandering the Sahara Desert for 40 
years. Perhaps the author had in mind 
the 38 years in the desert at Sinai. 
. Finally, the article states the we 

should ..... stop getting hung up on the 
historicity of the Bible." Such a state-
ment is ludicrous. The authority of the 
Bible rests on its historical reliability. 
which can be empirically demon-
strated. To ignore the historicity of any 
historical document is to cut oneself 
off from the hope of objectivity. Such 
an approach is doomed to solipsism. 

The article employs this type of 
circular reasoning by beginning with 
the premise that the core of Jesus' 
teaching is to "love your neighbor." 
By selectively rejecting other por-
tions of the Bible when we read it, we 
arrive at a faulty conclusion that in-
evitably mirrors the original premise 
- the core of Jesus' teaching is to 
"love your neighbor."

EdJtor: 
I was just reading lonna Palmer's 

Jan. 20th article, "San Diegan Throws 
Hat in Ring." While I hope that Dick 
Rider gets enough votes to cost Pete 
Wilson the election, I would also hope 
that Rider does not get votes because 
of his program, but because of 
Wilson's failed policies. 

Mr. Rider was incorrect when he 
stated "in the middle of this recession 
[WilsonJ just signed off on a 10 per-
cent across-the-board pay increase for 
state employees." In fact, 18 months 
ago unions negotiated a three-yearcon-
tract with the state which reduced their 
pay nearly five pen:ent. Halfofthe "10 
percent increase" simply reinstated 
what state employees were originally 
earning. As for the other five percent, 
it was the first pay increase which they 
had received in three years.

AIDS: Conflict of 
interests plague 
scientific research 
ContInued from ..... 4 
you to catch the flu every year, you 
can contract different viruses or bac-
terium of the same SID. Similarly, 
viral infections aansmitted via intra-
venous drug use (needle-blood con-
tact) cwld compromise the immune 
system. 

The second cause is environmen-
tal factors, such as malnutrition. Sut 
more important, according to 
Duesberg, is consistent, long-term 
drug use. Cocaine. crystal meth and 
poppers wreak havoc on the immune 
system. Duesberg believesamylnitrate 
inhalants may be the worst: "Poppers 
are mutagenic, carcinogenic, awful 
stuff," he says . 

Unfortunately, this alternative 
theory plays into the hands of moral-
ists. It may reignite the "sinner" ste-
reotype which AIDS activists have 
tried to shed during the last few years. 
Responding to mainstream stereo-
types, AIDS groups have pushed the 
horrific image of "one wrong tuck 
and you're finished" on the public. 

But according to Duesberg's hy-
pothesis, this just isn't so. HIV, in 
collaboration with drugs and other 
immune system destroyers, can kill 
you. Alone, it won't One indiscrimi-
nate fuck, well-spaced drug use, these 
won't kill you. Suicidal debauchery, 
the rock 'n' roll hipster lifestyle-or 
whatever you want to call it - just 
might 

The American medical establish-
ment still clings to the original AlDSi 
HIV theory and has so far refused to 
consider an alternative theory. 

Duesberg claims that the National 
Institute of Health rejected a recent 
grant proposal he made for cancer 
research in part because he disputes 
the AlDSIHIV theory. 

Scientists worldwide have called 
for further research into AIDS, yet 
little funding goes to people like 
Duesberg working on non-HIV 
projects or even those working on 
muhiple-cause, HIV -AIDS research. 
People who test positive for HIV lose 
their life insunsnce, theirjobs-many 
people's lives have been ruined. What 
a tragedy if the AIDSIHIV theory 
turns out to be false. 

Surroughs-Welcome, the pharma. 
ceuticalcompany which manufactures 
AIr, pours money into keeping the 
HIV hypothesis central to AIDS re-
search_ AIr, however, does not save 
lives. It stalls AIDS momentarily by 
blocking RNA to DNA translation, 
but it also stops new cell growth, 
which ultimately spells death forthose 
who take it 

In a brilliantly-written article in 
Edge magazine, Michael Jones de-
scribed the recent world AIDS con-
ferencein Berlin. Several people from 
AIDS-Info Switzerland who were 
pushing for more research into the 
alternative AIDS theory were physi-
cally bearen by Acr-UP members 
from England. Interestingly, 'Ihe air-
fare of these Acr-UP members had 
been paid by Surroughs-Welcome 
(via a £50,000 "donation''). 

Even more horrifying were the 
Wall Street brokers at the conference 
who spent half of their time listening 
to presentations and the other half 
phoning theirclielllS about ''ho('' stock 
tips. the latest phannaceuticaI devel-
opments. Hasn't enough money been 
made off of people's suffering? 

Monday, January 31,1994 

What all of this points to is a lad 
of distinction between corporate and 
public interests. In case after case 
(including those non-AIDS relaled), 
top government-funded researchers 
sell their discoveries for huge profit, 
often owning stock in the cornJXlllY to 
which they sell their research. This 
phenomenon. when science is more 
concerned with financial gain than 
mitigatinghumansufferingorellpand-
ing human knowledge, is epidemic. 

The man who "discovered" HIV, 
Robert Gal 10, fought a hardcwrt battle 
to win the rights to its discovery. This 
has garnered him huge profits be-
cause HIV became synonymous with 
the AIDS crisis. 

Duesberg and other researchers 
woOOng within similar paradigms 
must not be blacklisted. Not funding 
them because their research clashes 
with the cash monopoly of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health (NIH), Na-
tional Science FoundBtiori (NSF) and 
other corporations is crimina!. 

The youth of the world must be 
fully educated about AIDS. The ri-
diculous internment (a.k.a. concen-
tration) camp vision of Lyndon 
Larouche is stamng to surface again. 
Privacy rights, a cornerstone of a free 
sociery, are being threatened under 
the rubric of "public good." Such hys-
teria festers in a realm of authoritar-
ian-enforced ignorance. 

Our children need to be laught 
openly about all 5elluaI preferences. 
They need to know the pros and cons 
of drug use - without distortion. Sui-
cidallifestyles don 'tjust happen. And 
our society has created them on a 
massive scale. If we really want to put 
an end to AIDS, we must open our 
minds and live healthy lives. 

I'm not through holding my breath.

from nine different campgrounds, 
hike on 90 trails or scale up one of 
the 4,000 roc:kclimbing routes

two guides and, depending on the 
length and degree of difficulty of 
the trip, one or two guide trainees, 
who are learning the skills neces-

By ErIn Anderson 
Staff Writ., 

One never knows what role one 
will play during a trip with Outback 
Adventures. When Warren Col-
lege junior Tim Kranz signed up 
to be a trainee-guide for UCSD 
Outback Adventures' Black Can-
yon Canoe and Hot Springs Trip 
to Arizona, he had very little expe- . 
rience canoeing, but thought it 
would be a fun way to learn the 
skill from the other, more accom-
plished guides. When a shortage 
of guides forced Kranz to become 
a secondary guide on the trip, the 
ellperience became a challenging 
test. The first day's route took the 
group on a journey up to the hot 
springs. 

"Basically we're here for the participants ellplore the Anza-
students so they can get out there Borrego desert by day and watch 
on their own and do it inexpen- stars by night. An astronomer leads

"[The other guide and I] were 
basically winging it,just using our 
collecti ve experience, but [we had 
a] lack of knowledge of the area," 
Kranz said. 

The next day, the group paddled 
to a spot right below the Hoover 
Dam and explored a tunnel near a 
hot spring close to the dam. Kranz 
:md the other guides led the group 
through the steam and hot water in 
the tunnel. 

- - "We had them all in a row, 
holding hands, and we went in 
without a light and just started 
stumbling forward until we hit 
the end of the cave. It was really 
neat, it was a good experience," 
Kranz said. 

UCSD's Outback Adventures, 
a non-profit, student-run outdoor 
recreation organization, offers stu-
dents and non-students one of the 
widest varieties of inellpensive 
outdoor excursions and rental 
sporting goods equipment in San 
Diego. 

Director Mike Ruthenberg, a 
graduate of San Diego State Uni· 
versity who worked with the out-
door program there, founded 
Outback Adventures in 1989. De-
spite its humble beginnings, 
Outback now organizes 30 to 40 
outings per quarter and is staffed 
by 70 volunteer guides. 

GUARDIAN 

FEHTUHES 
"Relative to what you'd have 

to pay at, say, The Sport Chalet, 
the prices we give the students are 
really good," said Kranz. He added 
that most of Outback's rentals are 
weekly, instead of daily because 
it's "easier for students. They have 
more time to pick it up and bring it 
back." 

Outback also makes it easier 
for students to visit some of 
America's premier outdoor rec-
reation areas by organizing out-
of-state trips, including destina-
tions as far away as Utah, Colo-
rado and Mexico. 

According to Ludin, two of 
the most popular outings are the 
Black Canyon Canoe & Hot 
Springs trip along the Colorado 
River and the Sliclcrock Moun-
tain Bike tour in Moab, Utah. 

Other trips include more local 
destinations like Joshua Tree Na-
tional Monument where, after a

For water lovers, Outback of-
fers sea kayaking clinics and trips 
to Baja, areas off the San Diego 
coast and Mission Bay. One trip 
includes a moonlight bay paddle 
topped off by a potluck barbecue. 

Although 98 percent of 
Outback's guides are students, 
non-students can also be guides. 
Outback's volunteer staff is the 
true backbone of the organization, 
according to Ludin. "It's the stu-
dents who work for us that make 
Outback who we are. Without their 
volunteering, we wouldn't be 
here," he said. 

Kranz, who has been a guide 
for rockclimbing and cross-coun-
try skiing trips, iriltiaJly became 
involved in Outback because he 
was looking for a place to 
rockclimb. A resident advisor di-
rected him to an Outback guide 
meeting in which a climbing wall 
was discussed. 

"Seing in Outback is a really 
good experience because you build 
up a lot of self confidence. You're 
there with a group of people who 
put their trust in you and look to 
you for guidance tbn>ugh these 
activities," he said. 

Despite the speed with which 
the trips fill up, Ludin said Outback 
aims for more student involve-
ment. "I've had seniors come up to 
me and say, 'I just found out about 
Outback.' We want people to know 
that we're here," Ludin added.

CHANGES: 
uc officials review 
academic programs 
ContInued from p ... 1 
what other universities around the 
country are doing to adjust to de-
creasina resources, you would be 
struck by the fact that in many 
cases, we are much further ahead 
in our actions and planning than 
most other universities," said 
Massey, adding that each campus 
has a committee in place that is 
involved in the restructuring pro-
cess. 

At UCSD, changes in academic 
programs have already been imple-
mented. Last year, the university 
suspended the fledgling School of 
Architecture, while an Academic 
Senate task force made recom-
mendations on the ways in which 
each department could streamline 
and cut its expenses. 

According to Academic Senate 
Chair Stephen Cox, what UCSD is 
doing cannot, in actuality, be de-
scribed as restructuring. "What we 
are doing is keeping and enhanc-
ing what we have, which is a strong 
academic program," Cox said. 
"What we' re trying to do is pre-
serve our traditional strengths and 
add to those." 

The changes currently being 
reviewed by UC administrators 
have not yet been discussed by the 
Academic Senate, but Cox said 
that he expects the Senate to ad-
dress the proposals in due time. 

"We want students to be able to 
graduate as soon as possible. But 
at this campus, we take a very 
strong view toward general edu-
cation," Cox said. If the proposal 
to reduce time to obtain a degree 
means cutting back general edu-
cation requirements, Cox predicted 
that it will meet resistance from 
the Senate. 

A switch fro m the quarter sys-
tem to a semester system would 
spur much debatewithin the board. 
which is divided on the issue. Cox 
said. At UC Davis recently, the 
Academic Senate voted narrowly 
against switching to the semester 
system because of budget con-
strai nts. 

QUAKE: UCSD 
engineers release 
damage report 
Continued from pac. 2 
Ihe same week," he added. 

According to Structural Engi-
neering Professor Freider Seible, 
the Powell Laboratory is able to 
test up to five-story, full -scale 
structures under simulated seis-
mic loads. "We' ve been able to 
test inelastic actions in predeter-
mined locations in bridge struc-
tures. Then we repair them and re-
test the structures," Seib[e said. 

School of Engineering Dean 
Robert Conn concluded 
Thursday's press briefing by an-
swering critics who say the Uni-
versity of California should 
spend more time teaching in 
classrooms and working with un-
dergraduates. 

"Classroom teaching is a very 
imponanl pan of what we do, but 
this research is a[so a signifICant 
partofwhat the UniversityofCaJi-
fornia is all about. If we didn't 
have a research university, all this 
[technical advancement I wouldn ' t 
be. Right now, we' re saving lives 
by properly reinforcing bridge 
structures," Conn said.

Tritons Set 
Back By 
CSULB, 
Trojans 
NINER FIRE: Tritons' 
strong outing spoiled by 
Long Beach victory 
By D8n Kraft 
Staff Writer 

The Triton men's volleyball team 
is undoubtedly faced with one of the 
toughest tasks of any sports team 

The UCSD Guardian 

Jason Rltchle/Guard,an here at UCSD 
- battling top 
Division I foes 
composed of 
highly recruited 
scholarship ath-

Tom BllICk recorded six kill. and 8 t ............ three dip va, USC, 

.. _-I-.L-....,rw letes in the 
Southern Cali-
fornia hotbed of 
volleyball. 

Inevitably, 
many of these 
matches are 
viewed as learn-

ing experiences. UCSD chalked up 
another lesson in Friday night's 
three-set home loss to Long Beach 
State. 

The Tritons played outstanding 
volleyball through two-thirds of the 
first game, but couldn't maintain 
their torrid pace. The Forty-Niners 
scored five straight unanswered 
points to take the first set, 15-9. 

"We played the best we've played 

all year at the beginning of this 
match," Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik said. "We were just un-
able to sustain that level of play 
throughout the match." 

Long Beach quickly seized the 
second set and grabbed control of 
the match with a 15-2 domination. 

At times the Tritons appeared 
disorganized, but Dannevik took the 
brunt of the blame. 

'" have been changing up the 
formation and trying different com-
binations of players," Dannevik said. 
"The guys have been doing a great 
job of playing solid ball despite my 
changes." 

UCSD's never-say-die attitude 
shone in the third and final game as 
the Tritons battled back from a 14-2 
deficit to run the score to 14-7 be-
fore finally bowing out to their stron-

Absolutely! 

gerfoes, 15-7. 
Having to face top Division [ 

opponents may seem a bit unfair, 
but the players view it differently. 

"It 's a challenge," senior Tyson 
Kerr said. "The location and aca-
demic reputation of UCSD will 
eventually get us solid recruits that 
may get us over the top." 

On Wednesday night the Tritons 
got an up-c1ose-and-personal look 
at the number-one ranked team in 
the nation, USC. 

UCSD played a respectable 
match against its northern neighbor, 
but dropped the contest, 15-9, 15-1 
and 15-13. 

Jason Mulholland and Chris 
Underwood led USC with 21 and 16 
kills, respectively. 

Steve Kremsertallied 10 kills for 
UCSD.

HENS: Tritons 
can't coop with Pomona 
ContInued from .,... 18 

resembled a really toughjunior-high 
team. turning the ball over with regu-
larity and shooting a horrendous 29 
percent. 

It took Pomona-Pitzer a whop-
ping 30 seconds to snare its first 
lead of the game, while UCSD con-
structed a sturdy chimney around its 
offensive basket, throwing up more 
bricks than a mason could bat a 
spatula at. 

The Tritons finally found the 
bucket five minutes into the half, 
but by then the Sagehens had upped 
their lead to five. 41-36. 

Pomona-Pitzer hustled to loose 
balls, staked its claim to the boards 
and clamped down on Beaver in the 
defensive low-post. The senior 
scored only six points in the second 
half. 

Malone called a timeout, trying 
desperately to awaken her lackadai-
sical team. 

The UCSD Guardian SPORTS II 

UCSD center Lisa Beaver poured 
home San Diego's first seven points 
and Pomona·Pitzer could muster no 
defensive answer. The Tritons held 
a comfortable 17-9 lead. Then Bea-
ver picked up her second foul and 
was forced to take a seat. 

For the next couple of minutes 
the coach's strategy seemed to work. 
UCSD forged ahead, 4341 with 
12:48 left. With 9:45 on the clock 
the two teams were knotted at 47. 

SenIor point luard Rodney Luaaln (left) coPlected 17 points and four atealaln UCSD'a 79-60 win_ 

Without its go-to player on the 
floor, UCSD grew softer and softer 
on both ends of the court. The 
Sagehens reeled offfive quick poin~ 
to pull within three, 

Beaver reentered the game to 
restore some order with seven min-
utes remaining in the half and UCSD 
regained its composure, taking a 24-
19 lead. 

At the half, the Tritons . were 
ahead. 34-31. with Beaver scoring 
II points and controlling the boards 
with authority. 

Then the transformation took 
place. Exit Jeckyl, enter Hyde. 

During the second half, UCSD 

But the more poised Pomona-
Pitzer bunch now had a tight grip on 
the game's pace. 'Hens sophomore 
Saltari Morrison (25 points) ran the 
show. connecting on numerous driv-
ing layups and bombing from the 
outside. 

The Sagehens led by four with 
five minutes left. by eight with four 
minutes left. by 10 with two min-

-utes left and by II with less than a 
minute remaining. Pomona-Pitzer 
outscored UCSD 18-9 during' that 
stretch and dominated the home 
squad, 44-30, in the second half. 

Beaver finished with 17 points 
and 18 rebounds while freshman 
Kelly McGlothlin netted 15 points. 

M. HOOPS: 
Win streak continues 
ContInued from .,.,e 16 
shots on the other end. With 5:22 
left before the intermission. 
Johnson's three-point launch from 
downtown Detroit put the Tritons 
up, 27-24. and it was bye-bye 
Bethany. Thanks for coming out. 

Lusain (17 points, four steals) 
suddenly transformed a lackadaisi-
cal Triton performance into a per-
sonal vendetta against the atrocities 
of mankind. picking pockets and 
canning three straight jumpers to 
run the score to 35-28. 

Johnson's off-balance, buzzer-
beating fall-away jumper from just

look at what makes 
people choose to 
risk their lives to 
create a better 
world. Noon 

inside the top of the key put UCSD 
up, 39-32. at halftime. 

"We had a lackluster first half," 
Marshall said. "Our offense was set 
up right but we were turning the ball 
over, not making the extra pass. 
There was no attention to detail." 

The Tritons had no such prob· 
lems in the second half. 

Sharpshooter Johnson, no 
stranger to the world of supersti. 
tious behavior, became hotter than 
Georgia asphalt in mid-summer, 
draining three three-pointers during 
the half on his way to netting 19 
points. 

But it was Allen that capped the 
gem of the evening, soaring in from 
orbit to jam a Lusain 4O·foot ally· 
oop lob pass home, running the tally 

to 71-51 with 3:51 remaining. 
" I didn' t Ihink about anything 

but not dropping the ball." Allen 
said. "I knew that if I didn't get that 
one down [Lusain] would never give 
me another one. He's been on my 
back about dropping the ball." 

Rest assured, Allen (19 points) 
will be seeing more of those. 

Allen has his own assessment of 
the Triton success story. "At every 
huddle, I pull [Johnson's I underarm 
hair. 11 works. I'm telling you. Just 
before we took off in the first half. I 
got him a good one." 

" It's the nastiest tradition I've 
ever seen," Johnson said. " And I've 
done it aiL" 

But Johnson understands - al-
ways respect a win streak.

Tritons 
Ranked 
Eighth 
PRESEASON POLL: 
UCSD begins '94 season 
with highest ranking ever 
By Aron Miller 
Associate Sports Editor 

Usually when a team finishes a 
season with a sub-.500 record, the 
accolades don't come pouring in. 

Then there's 
the UCSD 
baseball 
team. 

In 1993, 
the Tritons 
'I'ffl~tiiI""'. ended their 

up- and-down 
campaign 
with a medio-
cre 15-20-1 
marl" 

On the 
bright side, 

they return 17 players, including 
All-American candidate Chris 
Miyake, who last year set a single-
season UCSD record for doubles 
(18) and brings an 18-game hitting 
streak into the 1994 season. 

It's no wonder that when the 
NCAA Division ill preseason poll 
released by Collegiate Baseball 
came out earlier this month, San 
Diego found itself ranked eighth in 
the nluion. 

The UCSD Guardia. 

Mark Hartmann and the Tritons look to uphold their top-10 rankine. 

Of the squads in the top 30, only 
the Tritons failed to tally a winning 
record last season. So much for rat-
ing on past performance. 

"r think the ranking indicates that 
we have a strong program, and also 
that we probably play the toughest 
schedule in the country," UCSD 
Manager Lyle Yates said. 

Among the Tritons' 15 wins last 
season were a 7-5 triumph overtop-
10 foe Eastern Connecticut, as well 
as a victory over eventual national 
champion Montclair State, this 
season's early number-one pick. 
It's quite apparent that the group has 
talent and is eagerto show the rest of 
the country what it is capable of 
accomplishing. 

"As a team we were really sur-
prised [by the ranking]," Miyake 
admitted. "We didn't think we got 
that much respect. [This season] 
we're going out to prove that we 
belong [in the top 10)." 

Senior left-hander Ryan 
Flanagan leads an experienced Tri-
ton pitching staff which includes 
juniors Mark Hanmann and Steve 
Height, and senior Kun Luhrsen. 

"We have a lot more depth this 
year." Miyake said. "We have seven 
or eight guys who can throw for us." 

UCSD begins its season Satur-
day, Feb. 5 at home against Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo.

and Diane Wegienka. Both domi-
naced in the I OO-meter breaststroke, 
turning in blazing times that easily 
outdistanced the rest of the field. 

Senior Allison Dunn also turned 
in an encouraging performance. 
Recovering from an injury which 
kept her out of the water for much of 
the season, Dunn appeared to be in 
top form en route to untouchable 
times in both breaststroke events.

performances turned in by the 
breaststrokers," Daniels said. 'The 
women did especially well." 

Not to be forgotten, the men also 
performed well. showing everyone 
exactly why the men's leam is a

The Cowboys came out of their 
locker room at halftime with fire in

in the gut of Thurman Thomas. Af-

Miller iced a win in the 100-
meter bunerfly and provided an en-
core with a sterling first-place show-
ing in the 200-meter backstroke. 

Sophomore Andrew Hollywood 
made a big splash as well, turning in 
quality times in two of his best 
events, the 100- and 200-meterback-
strokes. Hollywood is looking to 
tum some heads at the Champion-
ships in both events. 

Sophomore Stephen Hansock 
did his part to help out the team. 
sprinting to inspirational perfor-
mances in the 100- and 200-meter 
backstroke and notching personal 
bests in both. Even more impressive 
is the fact that Hartsock accom-
plished both feats untapered. 

The men's breaststroke special-
ist. Chris Jagard. posted a strong 
second-place in the 200-meter 
breaststroke. 

Daniels said he likes his teams 
chances in the championships. "I'm 
very excited about the next few 
weeks." Daniels said. "I'm really 
looking forward to seeing how we 
do at the conference meet."

plaining of "cramps." Quite the com-

Before the game, Enberg de-
scri bed Bills Coach Levy as a schol-
arly man who liked to quote phi-
losophers and presidents. 

As the Cowboys scored the go-
ahead touchdown, the TV cameras 
caught the erudite Levy uttering 
the mother of all cusswords, no 
doubt quoting famed philosopher 
Ice-T. 

It was a predictable drubbing in a 
game where drubbings are becom-
ing a matter of course.

Veto the Bills 

At last. a dynasty is theirs. 
They faced adversity, internal 
dissension and a highly-touted 
opponent. Yet, through it all, they 
tood tall and claimed the glory 

that was destined to be theirs. 
Yes, the Buffalo Bills have 

achieved immortality. 
Oh, sure, it's immortality 

for 10 ing four consecutive 
Super Bowls, but immortality 
nonetheless. In a game that was 
neither super nor played in a 
bowl, the Buffalo Bills 
natched defeat from the jaws 

of victory by falling to the 
hated Dallas Cowboys, 30-13. 
Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas 
and company may be remem-
bered for their inability to wi n 
the big one, but at lea t they' ll 
be remembered. Can the same 
be said for Vince Ferragamo, 
Tony Eason and other lesser 
lights who had the skill to lose 
just one Super Bowl? I think 
not.

UCSD Leaves 
Bruins In Ruins 
BETHANY BASHING: Tritons tally ninth victory in 
last 10 games with 79-60 triumph over visiting Bethany 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

Always respect a winning streak. 
Pitch a perfect game and the socks 
can' t be washed until the next loss. 

Win three in a 
row and the 
coach will take 
the same route 
to the stadium. 
In a profession 
bent on bring-
ing home the 
·W,' supersti -
tions can play 
a major role in 
the minds of 
coaches and 
players alike. 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team (16-4) has developed a few 
idiosyncracies of its own in its re-
cent victory spree, which includes 
three straight wins and nine out of 
its last 10 games. 

Kahl il Allen. The sophomore has 
scored the tirst points in nine of the 
Tritons' last II victories. And one 
never messes with positive results. 

Aune hit Allen at the free-throw 
line. The forward deftly caught the 
ball, sliced his way to the hole and 
banked in a soft four-foot jumper. 

·On the other side of the court Head 
Coach Tom Marshall looked at hi s 
assistants and smiled. Always re-
spect a streak. 

"We are all getting a bit supersti-
tious about that," Lusain said. " I 
don' t think we purposefully just go 
to [Allen], but in the back of our 
minds we know he has been hitting 
[the openerl." 

Unfortunately, Marshall wasn' t 
smiling for long. Bethany (6-15) 
brought a couple of stars of its own 
in forward Joe Woods (23 points, 17 
rebounds) and guard Clint Ladine. 
In the early going, the tandem qui-
eted the packed Triton house in at-
tendance for UCSD's spirit night. 

The Bills can now stand 
proud alongside the likes of the 
Minnesota Vikings and the 
Denver Broncos, the only other 
teams to 10 e as many Super 
Bowls. Of course, the Vikings 
and the Broncos took many 
years to amass their records of 
shame and incompetence. The 
Bills did it in just four years, a 
feat that will probably never be 
equaled in all of sport. Kahlll Allen (rlJht) tiles throu", the air en route to two of l1li19 points. 

Saturday's spirited 79-60 bruis-
ing of visiting Bethany College 
started in the manner the Tritons 
have come to expect. 

San Diego was caught out of 
tune defensively and the Bruinscapi-
tali zed, surging to a 19-14 advan-
tage midway through the quarter. But let's give the Bills some 

credit - they did reach the 
Super Bowl four years in a row, 
something that no other team 
has done. And when you think 
about it, it's kind of insane to 
dismiss a team that's been as 
successful as Buffalo for so 
long just because January has 
been a cruel, cruel month. 

Pomona-Pitzer 'Sagely 
Rodney Lusain controlled the 

ball on the left side of the court and 
spotted a cutting Nate Hantgin, who 
whipped the ball into center Matt 
Aune. Aune knew what to do- find 

But UCSD refused to budge, with 
Aune and Allen sweeping the boards 
and senior Erik Johnson drilling

SETBACK: UCSD women continue to struggle with

nMBER: UCSD wanns up for Pacific Collegiate Swim 
Championships with easy win over visiting Bulldogs 

Oh, to hell with praising 
Buffalo. I bet my good money 
on those bastards, and now I'm 
out for blood. Watch your 
back, Marv Levy .... 

The game got off to a good 
start during the pre-game show. 
Bob Costas was interviewing 
Bill Cosby (I wasn't aware he 
was even suiting up for the big 
game) while 0.1. Simpson told 
the viewers at home that "the 
temperature is 68 degrees and 
the weather conditions are 
perfect," which would be earth-
shanering news if the game 
wasn' t played inside a dome. 

As Bob Trumpy and Dick 
Enberg were quick to point out, 
the Bills won the first half. 
Their offense was clicking. 
The defense was holding Emmit

The Tritons (8-10) held as much 
as an eight-point advantage in the 
first half and looked like a team 
deserving of a playoff berth. 

Of course, during this Jeckyl and 
Hyde-like season, UCSD played 
pitifully at times as well. Unfortu-
nately for the home team, Mr. Hyde 
reared his ugly head toward the end 
of the game and decided to stick 
around until the final buzzer. Final 
score - Sagehens 75, UCSD 64. 

"We were out-hustled, out-re-
bounded, out-worked. We played 
terrible," UCSD Head Coach Judy 
Malone grumbled.

UCSD reponded by turning in a 

solid effort, swimming aggressively 
and posting impressive times in the 
process. 

Before the races, the team held a 
drawing for a new Geo Tracker. The 
giveaway was part of a fund-raising 
event to help the team pay its ex-
penses . 

"It was a good day for us," Assis-
tant Coach Rich Daniels said. "It 
was a chance for our swimmers to 
get in their last races before the big

At the stan of the 1993-94 men's basketball season, s0pho-

Then the injuries to Allen's peers srarted rollinl in, mini the
