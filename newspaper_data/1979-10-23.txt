North City West Plan Approved 7-2 
By Kathy Huffer 

Associate News Editor 
North City West received formal blessings 

from the San Diego City Council yesterday, at 
least temporarily ending years to delays and 
controversy surrounding approval of the 
proposed community just east of Del Mar. 

In a ~even to two vote, the council approved 
the Carmel Valley Precise Plan, the first of nine 
phases of North 'ity West that will eventually 
e xpand to a community of 40,000. 

Construction of thi ' phase will not begin for 
at least a year. A school financing plan. gra ding 
a nd other detail ' of the development must b 
provided for before ground can I)" broken. 

Only two council memb rs, out -going 
Maureen O 'Connor and Bill Mitchell. 
councilman for this distric t, voted a gainst the 
d velopm nl. 

While North City Wes t crossed its toughest 
hurdle yesterda y. it faces two poss ible court 
action ' from North County groups . Hoth the 
Coalition for Responsihle Planning. a Del Mar-
based citiL n group that actively opposed 
approval of North City West. and the City of 
Del Mar are threatening legal action. 

The coalition will not take any action until th 
an Diego Council approves a school financing 

plan for the development this spring. according 
to Gemma Parks. a co-chairwoman of the 
group. 

And Del Mar Mayor AI Tarkington said 
a fter yesterday's vote that a lthough he does not 
know on what grounds Del Mar would take the 
issue to (tourt. the city will discuss " lots of 

possibiliti s" at a special Del Mar Council 
meeting tonight. 

Parks would not concede defeat after the 
council's strong vote of support for North 'ity 
W "st. "We made the project a lot better," she 
said just after the vote. Coalition pressure on the 
council resulted in num rous changes in the 
original proposal. she said. 

Despite their ' upport of North City West, 
council m ember ' seemed reludant to take a 
final vote on the 10-year-old issue. ever ... 1 
members held off the vote at the final moments 
by justifying their approval of th 'development. 

Counc ilman Fred chnaub It , partially 
quoting from Alvin Toffler 's Future Sh()cI~ , told 
the audie nce "there are people .. . who can't cope 
with rapid change, " and urged those present to 
"follow through on our needs." 

Mitchell. on the other hand, read from a 
prepared stateme nt his opposition to th 
development, charging tha t " North City West 
is like putting 100 peopl > in a r staura nt with a 
capacity of 50." 

Before construction of the Carmel Valley 
phase can begin a city-appointed committee 
must come up with a school financing plan. '/h 
plan. is expected this spring. Council members 
stressed yesterday th y will not approve the first 
zoning map until they are guarctnteed no North 
Ci ty West children will be taught in 
"neighborhood garages" or be bused to nearby 
di ·tricts. 

The Carmel Valley plan will accommodate 
more than. 2,000 dwelling unit · wi thin a 378-

Bill Mitchell was one of two City Councilmen to oppose North City 
West. But Mitchell, UCSD's councilman, wall joined only by 
Maureen O'Connor in Irying to defeat the 40,000 person North 
County development. 

Fees 'Will Rise $20-$25: McElroy 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 

News Editor 
Registration fees will have 

to rise $20-$25 a quarter n xt 
year, Chancellor William 
Mc Elroy said in his "State of 
the University" address 
yes terday. 

Inflation will keep the fee 
going up, McElroy said, 
adding that there is " no 
cei ling " on how long fees will 
continue to increase. 

It is <1ls<>" possible, he said, 

Chancellor William McElroy 

that Education Fees, currently 
$100, may rise. 

McElroy addressed a wide 
range of topics during his 
speech, given annually to 
representatives of the staff 
asso 'iation and press. 

"There's no question in my 
mind." th cha ncellor said, 
"that the (six percent) 
retroactive pay raise will be 
d "dared I gaily sound." 

"We will have to go ba'k to 
the Regents to ask for some 

(,lIu,.If .. II '1.010 I" I\t'" ".tnt'" 

hdp on this":,we can't pick it 
up ourselves. 

Employ ees who receive 
their salaries from research 
grants are not covered under 
the state increas, a 
discrepancy McElroy says will 
force the University "to go 
back to the President and 
Regents and ask for some help 
there ... it's dose to i"l 35 
million problem for the 
university as a whole, about 
$3.5 million of that h re ." 

The lame duck Chancellor 
also offered a st.atistical profile 
of UCSD. 

"70 percent of the r >search 

take, so to speak, is from the 
Physics. Biology and 

'hemistry d partrnents. 
"The general budget is 

$247 million, a new high," 
McElroy said . He explain d 
that most of that goes to 
research, the hospital and 
instructional programs, in Ihat 
order. 

McElroy emphasized 
community involvement in Ihe 
university throughout his short 
address. Nothing that the 
university payroll is $ 1 I 
million. McElroy said that 

(51) empluyees and 
students wert' one of the 
It'a<!ing economic forces in 

an Diego County . 
Since most of UC D's 

income comes from federal 
sources, McElroy said UC f) 
produces far more Ihan the 
state puts into it. 

Mc Elroy also said the 
univ 'rsity would continue to 
expand. adding a fifth college 
in five to ten yeilYs. 

McElroy 'uggested that a 
fifth college might revolve 
ilround a theme - perhaps 
oceahography - hut its 
graduation requirements 
would probably 110t be "all that 
different" for those al the other 
l'OlIt'gl's .

Est-Clone Would Love Genghis Khan 
By Wanda MacClaria 

A while back when I faced an important career 
choice, a friend urged me to take Lifespring 
traaning before making my decision. He said 
Lifespring had chang~ his life and this seemed 
true. He had been a tense , nervous man, a chain 
smoker who drank 15 cups of coffee a day . Now 
he appeared calm, self.assured, a nd neither 
smoked nor took caffeine. 

Freelance wriler Wanda MacClaria wrole this 
slory (or Pacific News Service. 

Lifespring Basic Training, like most of the 
businesses in the human potential movement , 
purports to be for "healthy people who want to 
grow." Like its better-known competitor, Erhard 
Seminars Training (est), it is a series of lectures, 
"sharings" with the group, and exercises. 

Lifes pring 's lounder and president, John 
Hanley once told an assistant that "est is like 
Usterine and Lifespring is like Scope ." Hanley 
worked with est founder Werner Erhard at Mind 
Dynamics, another personal growth bl:lsiness, 
before each went his way. 

Although I had always been skeptical of such 
groupa, I signed up. The price for 50 hours spread 
over five days was $250, and there is a money-
back guarantee for the dissatisfied. Hanley says 
"probably Ie .. than one percent" of ' 35,000 
customers have claimed it. 

I was to be included in their number. 
On a Wednesday evening in a San Francisco 

hotel meeting room, I looked around at the 110 
other people in my group and was reassured. They 
looked normal enough. Most seemed to be in their 
20s and 30s, and by their dothes they looked 
middle or upper-middle class. 

A trainer (there are two trainers with six 
. assistants) explained this was an authoritarian 
system, with the trainers in complete control. We 
were to agree to follow instructions and obey rules. 

No Plgce Is Safe 

We agreed. . 
No one could leave the room during the 

training. The room was windowless a nd watches 
or docks were not a llowed . Time hecame an 
undifferentiated /low, and the training bega n to 
seem like the only reality . We slept only lour or 
five hours a night. 

The trainer acknowledged la ter the sleep 
deprivation was deliberate, to make us less 
dependent on our rational minds . 

We plunged into five days on an emotiona l 

People may perform generous 
and altruistic acts, but their 
motive is always selfish. 
rolle r coaster. When I finally got 01/, I decided it 
had been a shoddy and dangerous ride . 

In one early exercise, lor example, we paired off 
with partners and sat opposite them. The lights in 
the room were lowered and we li stened, with eyes 
closed , while the trainer talked about a perfed 
childhood day. 

We were toll to return in our minds to such a 
day and remember that carefree feeling, the 
games we played , our favorite dinner and the love 
of parents. Then we were asked to reme mber our 
father 's laces . Suddenly, Irom the speakers 
around the room came a sentimental song 
crooning about "Dad. " 

I opened my eyes in surprise - I couldn 't 
believe they were using such cheap devices to 
manipulate a response . To my uller astonishment , 
however, I heard a few people in the room crying . 
It became contagious as the trainer said 
repeatedly , "Get into it, le t your feelings flow. don't 
hold back." The room was soon filled with the 
sounds of 100 people sobbing and shrieking. 

In the days tha t followed we were told 
repeatedly that the m.ajor obstacle to self growth is 
a stubborn clinging to "fixed beliefs a nd values ." 
W e were urged to re·examine our fixed belie fs 
a nd , if possible, to reject them . 

'The traine rs were e xplicit about the Lifesprinl{ 
heli efs . One is tha t emotion and intuition, not 
intelligence, are the valuable determinants of 
huma n beha vior . 

Another is that there is no ultimate truth or 
reality . A Lifespring person will never disagree 
with a nything. Instead , he will say, "I'm open to 
tha t, but my experience has been ... " 

"During World War II the Allies thought they 
were right, a nd the Axis powers thought they were 
right ," one of the trainers said. "Germany and 
Ja pan surrende red , received American aid, and 
are now powerful countries." 

That was conclusive prool , he said , that there is 
no ultimate right or wrong . Ye t one side in tha t war 
had murdered six million people in concentra ti on 
camps. I am sorry to report tha t neither I no r 
a nyone else cha llenged the trainer's version. 

A ccording to Lifespring, selfishness governs 
every human act ion. People may perlorm 
generous or altruistic acts, but their motive is 
a lways selfish - to leel superior or self-righteous. 
Trai nees were encouraged to ad on their 
selfishness. 

A middle-aged woman screa med into the 
microphone a t one point that she hated her ex-
husband because he no longer wanted the ir 
teenaged son to live with him. She said he r-form er 
husband wanted to "dump" the son on her to care 
lor, and she didn't want him. 

The trainer asked her why she was "a lraid" to 
throw her son out on the street, which is what she 
rea lly wanted to do. The trainer concluded, on the 
basis of her hesita nt replies , that she had a "marty r 
complex" a nd probably always would. "You

since 1936, with only a four 
year break during WWII 
when .it housed Marines, it has 
been used .as sludent co-
operative housing. 

Students, unlike most 
domesticated animals, feel no 
rE-morse al soiling their own 
homes . 50 alter years as 
student housing the place is 
more than just a little ragged 
around the edges. In fad, it's 
structurally unsound . The 
vibrations from soccer games 
in the halls and beds pounding 
against the walls and the 
amplified bass heat of Phil 
Lesh I.ave, over the years, 
cracked the mortar and 
shaken loose the nails of the 
cooed dorm. 

Even on solid ground it is a 
wonder that the old place 
stands at all. 

So it was with more than a 
little consternation that I 
awoke one morning this 
summer in my bed at 
Barrington to the rumblings of 
on e of th e strong es t 
earth9l!akes to hit the Bay 
area In years. 

The place, I thou ght , had 
about the same cha nce of 
sta nding as a hOllse of cards in 
a nuclear blast. 

As it turned out , the building 
shook like a wet dog, but, for 
some reason only Providence 
knows, it maintained its 

st~uctural integrity . Unfor· 
tunately , as a friend and I 
discov e red lat e r that 
afternoon, ea rthquakes can 
shake more than beds and 
ra ttle more than windows. 

With my friend Trapper 
Byrne - who comprises the 
entire Daily Guardian 
Berkeley Bureau and is a well 
thought-ol reporter at the 
Doily Californian - I was 

looking for a place to eat. We 
settled on downstairs at Kips . 
We never go upstairs, as that's 
where all the frat boys hang 
out, drinking Coors and 
vomiting and standing on the 
tables and singing the old 
lyrics of "Deulschland Ueber 
Alles. " The hippies and bums 
frequent the downstairs, all in 
all a better sort of clientele. 

Our lunchtime conversation 
naturally turned to the big 
event of the day . After 
registering amazement at 
Barrington 's resiliency our 
conversation took a more 
serious tone. 

"What if, " we wondered 
together , "this had been The 
Big One." It was a scary 
thought. 

Visions 01 Barrington 
crumbling like a stale graham 
cracker flashed in our heads. 

Geez, we thought, what if 
there is an aftershock. We 
knew that sometimes 
altershocks are stronger than 
the original quake. The "what 
ifs" continued and we were 
really getting scared. 

We checked around to see 
how Kips was constructed . It 
was brick and we knew that 
brick buildings always fall in 
strong quakes. We hurried to 
pay our bill; it was saler, we 
thought, to take our chances 
on the street than to be crushed 
by intoxicated fraternity 
brothers falling through (he 
'~eiling. 

But once on ~he street we 
nearly panicked . There were a 
thousand ways to buy it. 
Breaking windows , falling 
wires or out-of-control AC 
tr ansit buses'. 

No place was safe. 

We decided the only thing 
to do was to go back to 
Barrington, pick up Trapper's 
brirl friend Judy, and head for 
Tilden Park. 

Back at Barrington though , 
disaster struck. Judy. the poor 
girl, was - unaware of the 
danger and had wandered into 
town. 

Trapper 's spirit was broken. 
Grabbing my arm for 

emphasis Trapper pleaded 
with me to go on alone, but in 
this hour 01 danger I felt I 
should stay with him. "Listen 
Trap, it's probably just as 
dangerous at the park. A 
falling tree can kill you just as 
dead as a lamp post." 

As always. he thought of 
others .

that the government had illegally seized priva te Arab

The government will face several motions of no-
confidence in the Israeli Parliament on Tuesday. But 
it is expected to survive them , and Begin will 
probably rejec t the opposition Labor Party's call for 
new e lections. 

The five-judge Supreme Court ordered that the

Abortion Protestors 
Protest Wilson 
Voting Record 

By Dorothy Houston 
Special to the Guardian 

Representatives of local 
organizations pushing for abortion 
rights gathered yesterday at a 
downtown press conference to "affirm 
reproductive rights" and to oppose the 
"anti-abortion" voting record of Rep. 
Bob Wilson (R-San Diego). 

The press conference kicked off a 
group of pro-abortion activities 
planned for this week by the San Diego 
Abortion Rights Coalition in support of 
National Abortion Rights Week. 

The Rights Week has been designed 
by pro-abortion groups in response to 
national legislation passed this year 
an,d last year that restricts federal 
funding of abortions. 

Judith DiGennaro, a law pr~fessor 
speaking for the Coalition yesterday in 
front of the federal building, said the 
week has been "convened to remind us 
all that the struggle to maintain these 
rights ("reprodoctive") is always with

According to DiGennaro, state and 
federal lawl restrictin~ the public 
funding of abortions are seen "only as 
fiscal limitations on the government's 
paying for abortion," 

The difficulty with that analysis, she 
siad, is that "cutting off funds for poor 
women's abortions is a death sentence 
for many women who in their 
desperation ... will seek a n ill gal 
abortion at the hands of a butcher 
whose services they can afford ." 

DiGennaro referred to tho se 
opposing abortion as "anti-choice" 
rather than b.y the oft-used term "pro-
life. " No anti-abortion groups were 
apparent at the press confer nee . 
Groups represented at the meeting 
included the ACLU. Black Federation, 
National Lawyers Guild , Las 
Hermanas, CalPIRG, the California 
Abortion Rights Action League 
(South) and other groups. 

Two members of the UCSD 
Women's Center attended the 
conference and gave a statement to 
The -Daily Guardian which read in 
part: "We believe that reproductive 
freedom - the right to bear or not bear 
children - is a woman's right as basic 
as the more gender-free rights of 
speech or assembly." 

"Low-income women and young 
women particularly are·in no position

UCLA Adants, Wins 15-13 

Water Polo Strategy Good on Paper, But ... 
Hang Tough v~. UCLA ;:: Vocal Crowd Boost 

By Jon Goetz 
Sport. Editor 

JUit as the UCSD water polo team finally 
mastered it. new defenae, UCLA also mastered 
it, and con.equently beat the Triton. 15-13 
Friday night. 

The new defense is a system that avoids an 
ejection of the defender guarding the opponent 
in the two-meter position in front of the goal. 
After that defender fouls the hole man twice 
(three consecutive fouls results in a kick out), he 
leaves to guard the outside man, the defender 
on the outside wing switches to the center, and 
the center defender moves to cover the hole . 

Sound confusing? Confusion of the offense is 
the objective of the strategy. It forces the hole 
man to pass the ball out to a covered man, 
preventing a quick shot. 

The UCLA hole man, however, figured out 
the weakness in this defense. He ~ssed to the 
open outside wing while the UCSD defenders 
were busy switching men, and that wing scored 
most of UCLA's 15 goals. 

Ignoring those quick shots, the Tritons' play 
was probably their best of the year. The outside 
defense was firm and patient, keeping the ball 
outside for most of the game, 

The offense settled down, making 13 of the 
approximately 18 shots they attempted. As 
usual ; Kai Loedel led the scoring, with five 
goals. Toby Raymond, playing with stitches in 
his eyelid after an accident in practice, scored 
twice. . 

Coach Russ Hafferkamp would like him to. 
Goallie Willie Morris faced somethina he 

hadn ' t s~en this year - a ·teady barra!{e of 
shots rifled into the opposite corners, and they 
eluded him while he defended the deep end 
goal. 

The lead see·sawed between San Diego and 
'LA the whole "ame. Only the fourth Quarter 
sunk th~ Tritons. "We fe ll asleep for just 30 
seconds out of the entire game," said assistant 
Coach Scott Hinman. "We gave up the ball, 
and we gave it up again." UCLA &Cored both 
times and "we couldn't come back from that," 
Hinman said. 

"We fell asleep for just 
30 seconds out of the 

" game. 
One factor that helped keep the score elOIe 

throughout the game was the vocal crowd that . 
showed up for the Friday night contest. "Crowd 
res ponse is something new to water polo 
players ... It really gets the guya amped," said 
Hinman. "The opposing team. are intimidated 
by it. They've never seen it before_" Up to 250 
people have been attending the night game. at 
the natatorillm this year, lind the noise they 
make is amplified to a roar by the acoustics of 
the indoor facility. 

The four goals scored by Dan Crane were a 
pleasant surprise because until recently, he has 
not been utilizing his strong arm all much as 

Dan Crane scored four goals against UCLA 

That home advantage should help the team 
when they host Cal State Los Angeles on 
Friday night, and Cal State Fullerton on Friday.

San Salvador, the capital.

Blondie: ' Plastic, Rock 
By Barry Alfonso 

Contributing Editor 
I'm no theology student, but 

I would swear that Eat To The 
Beat, the new Blondie LP. was 
recorded in limbo, some 
netherworld between the 
realms of heaven and earth. 

Now that I think of it , Deborah 
Harry and the rest of the band 
have the qualities of 
ectoplasmic beings, not flesh 
and blood creatures. Don't get 
me wrong - I like this LP, but 
I have no illusions that it was 
made by real people.

hired Mr. Busy , an oeric..:r in

taking 1100 pictures , 58 of 
which 'are on display here. 

The first impression one 
gets from the autochromes is 
one of iln everyday familiarity 
and honesty . Even the more 
formal of the portraits conveys 
a sense of intima 'y, as if the 
subject felt comfortable havin!{ 
his picture taken and might 
have known Mr. Busy . 'There 
is no attempt to captwe any 
sensational eve nts or 
characters.

'Victim Contests' Kick Off Lifespring 
Continued from f>age 2 
wouid rather he ri!{ht and unhappy than wrong and 
happy." he said. The woman agreed and took her 
sea I. 

In the Lifespring worl<l. each person must 
accept total responsibility for everything in his life . 
If you're poor. for example. it's your own fault. 
'Ine only barriers 10 getting more money are such 
beliefs as: I <Ion't deserve it; there is something 
slightly evil about money; it is easier for a camel to 
pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich 
m'ln to pass through the gates of he'lYen. 

To dramatize this. the trainer stages a " Victim 
Con·test. to Three people who consi dered 
themselves victims volunteered to compete. 

The first was a man in his 40s whose diabetes 
flared up whenever he had a prohlem With a 
woman. 'Ine second was a young woman w'ho 
claimed that her father tried to rape her when she 
was 14 years old. ' Ine third was 'a woman in a 
wheelchair who had broken her h,lCk in a car 
accident. 

To judge who was the greatest victim, the 
trainer held a hand over each of the three in turn 
and the group voted by applauding for ' their 
favorite. 'Ine woman in the wheelchair won. 

'Ine trainees then paired off and performed an 
exercise which demonstrated that Imth victims 
and winners were responsible for themselves. '111e 
thrc!! contest victims th!!n shared with the group 
what they had learned . 

'Ine diabetic man adually had a psychosomatic 
problem, 'Ihe second woman said she had 
probably encouraged sexual advances from her 
father. to compensate for ~the normat love she 
didn't receive. And the trainer told the crippled 
woman that he sensed she WClS a very powerful 
person who couldn't deal with that power, so she 
set herself up to have the car accident which 
disahled her. 

"To - judge who was the 
greatest victim, the trainer held 
a hand ove~ each of the three in 
turn and the group voted by 
applauding .. ,the woman in the 
wheelchair won, " 

'Ihe success of the Lifespring training is partly 
dependent on the tremendous group pressure to 
conform that emerges ,,(hen III people spend five 
days together . The trainers use authoritarian 
methods to manipulate the human desire to 
Ix·lon!{. 

During the first day or two, the tminers willingly 
acknowlcd!{e any skepticism. Later . by a wink or 
the usc of sarcasm. they encourage the group to 

silem:e dissenters. By the end, known dissenters 
ilre not Clllowed to address the group - the trainer 
does not recognize them when they want to speak, 
and they are not given microphones. I was not one 
of the known dissenters. My criticisms were silent, 
or shared with other dissatisfied people I found. 

On the fourth day 01 the trainin!{. one younl-l 
woman stood up to addrelis the group. She said 
that for the first few days she had seen nothing 01 
value in the training. But, she continued, she had 
asked herself how she could he right and 100 
others coulli be wrong. On that basis she now 
thought the training was valuable. 

The trainer smiled hroadly when he heard this, 
and the group applauded the woman. 

'Ihe odds are further stacked against dissenters 
in a most frightening WilY. If anyone did not agree 
with a process or helief in the training. it was 
considered his problem. -Ine training itself could 
never he wrong. Any disaweement was 
summarily dismissed by a variation of this 
argument: " You're just not trying hard enough; 
you don't want to get into it; you're unwilling 
or afraid to let yourself go and experience 
the traini n!{." 

I cal led the Lifesprin!{ area director aft~ the 
training ended to ask for my $250 refund . 'Inere 
was no argument ahout the refund. hut he wanted 
to know why. When I told him som e of my 
objections to the training. he said in true Lifespring 
form, "I'm open to thaI."

Earthquake Shake 
Continued (rom page 2 
which is propelling him to the 
top of the jQurnalistic world, 
"you can buy it anywhere. 
Pink Cloud could overdose 
and murder us in our sleep. 

"We could get gunned 
down by some trigger-happy 
Oakland cop. We could get 
eletrocuted by our speaker 
wires. No place is safe. 

"If I'm going to get it I want 
to go waiting for Judy and 
listening 10 my stereo. " 

He was right. You could 
buy it anywhere. But I didn't 
have a stereo or a girl fri nd 
~nd I was more likely to run 
into the noted druggie Mr. 
Cloud at Barrington than 
anywhere else, so I moved on. 

Back on the street, every 
power pole my enemy and 
every door jamb my friend , I 
wandered, alon . 

Then I saw it. Safety . An 
expansive, solid looking 
parking lot - no ceilings, no 
pow r poles , no glass to 
shatter and b st of a ll a very 
mean looking parking 
attendant to dis ' ourag the 
druggies . 

Not looking exactly like a 
management student myself, I 
paused to buy the New Yorh 
Times at Southside books. A 
bit of respectability could not 
help but ingratiate me with the 
attendant. 

I sauntered up to a 1970 
VW bug, planted myself on 
the rubber bumper guard and 
began to read about all the 
famous people who had been 
murdered that day and the 

buses' and trains that had 
collided and overturned in 
various parts of the Third 
World. 

People in every corner of 
the globe were getting oUed, 
but ' l had found an island of 
safety. 

* * * 
I tell this story for a couple 

of reasons . First I want to 
reassure the people on the fifth 
floor of Central library, who 
jumped like white mice on 
amphetamines during our own 
recent earthquake, that they 
are not alone in their paranoia. 

And I think a communi -
cation I received recently 
somehow ties to all this. 

It seems a Mr. Richard T. 
Bartz, formerly of 812 South 
Sierra, Solana Bea ch, is the 
owner of a VW bug 
construct d between the years 
1971 -77 . 

n e normally effici ent folk s 
at Volkswagen, according to 
th ir communication , blew it. 
The VWs from thos years 
carried a faulty seal on the 
antenna cable allowin lf water 
to leak into th~ dashbo~rd and 
the fuse box . The wa ter , they 
said, could act as a conductor 
and start the car. 

Without a key. Without a 
driver . 

Can you see it, the next 
rainy day, gangs of driverless 
Volkswagens running people 
down'? 

I was stunned . Trap was 
right. 

No place is safe.

Blondie Pl~stic But Entrancing 
Conlinued from page 6 
.l:l surface of g litt ering 
synthesizers and satin·smooth 
voices that's as entrancing as it 
is irhuman. 

Of course, Deborah Harry 
is the star of the album 
throughout, comhining the 
apple·pie virginity of a Leslie 
("It's My Party") Gore or, 
bell r yet, a Shel ley F abaras 
(the girl teen on the old 
"Donna Reed Show") with the 
infla table-doll sensuality of a 
Donna Summer. Harry 's 
vocals on WI To The Beal can 
sound tender ("Shayla "), 
hysterical ("Eat To The 
Beat "), alluring ("Atomic"), 
or hip-grindingly sexy ("The 
Ilardest Part " ) as she 
chooses . 

The songs themselves on 
I·A., I To 'In -'" '3eul are wry, 
hook·laden and thoroughly . 
plasti " appealing in the 'ame 
way that a vinyl miniskirt is 

attractive. Harry's lyrics are 
filled with coy erotic 
innuendos, wicked lines ilbout 
pieces of piaa, tough.as·steel 
macho men and similar 
double-entendre imagery. The 
tunes, mostly the work of 
bandmembers Chris Stein, 
Jimmy Destri and Nigel 
Harrison, are economical, 
streamlined numbers, tasty 
even if artificially flavored <mel 
colored. The title track is 
especially nifty, a rock and roll 
steeplechase that will leave 
you panting for breath. 

flow thi ' LP stands up to 
Blondie 's ' first three, I'm not 
sure yet. On its own merits, it's 
witty, danceahle;lnd (·xpertly 
arranged. If it lacks sincerity, 
that's only because Blondie is
