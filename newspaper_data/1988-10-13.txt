UNiVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO THURSDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1988 VOLUME 65, 117 0 

Complaint Prompts New 
Media Disclaimer Policy 

By ERIC CHAZANKIN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Controversy has erupted over 
the issue of why the UCSD 
administration decided over the 
summer to require disclaimers on 
all student video productions, with 
allegations surfacing of influence 
by "a powerful San Diego insti-
tution." 

The new policy requires all stu-
dent videos produced through the 
campus media center to include 
disclaimers, intended to protect 
UCSD from legal liability. 

The media center has operated 
since 1976 without such disclai-
mers being required. The change 
in policy apparently resulted from 
a complaint about a video pro-
duced by a UCSD student using 
University facilities. 

The video dealt with labor rela-
tions at the San Diego U nion-
Tribune Newspapers, and was 
critical of the management there. 

UCSD student Greg Parman 
produced the video for a docu-
mentary class last spring. It was 
later shown on local cable T.V. 
channels as part of a "labor link" 
T.V. series. Parman feels that 
pressure from the U nion/ Tribune 
resulted in the policy change. 

"What I think we have going 
here is that Helen Copley donates 
X amount of dollars to UCSD," 
he said, referring to the owner 
and publisher of the newspapers. 

Copley vehemently denies tak-
ing any action whatsoever. "Oh, 
for heaven's sakes," she re-
sponded; "That certainly is not 
true. 1 have not talked to anyone 
at UCSD." 

Copley \S not unfamiliar with 

the issue, however. ". have a copy 
of the tape. 1 was told about its 
contents, and I was not particu-
larly concerned," she stated. 

While both students and Uni-
versity officials agree that requir-
ing disclaimers is a good idea, 
there is some disagreement about 
what caused UCSD to implement 
this policy now. The administra-
tion, in particular, seems sensitive 
to the issue. 

When pressed about why 
UCSD suddenly decided to re-
quire disclaimers on videos, As-
sistant Vice Chancellor of Aca-
demic Affairs Tom Hull re-
sponded in the following manner: 

Hull: ". know what you're 
looking for, and I'm not going to 
get into it." 

Guardian: "What ~ 1 looking 
for?" 

Hull: "You're going to trace it 
off campus to someone complain-
ing. I'm not going to get into it." 

"We just discovered the pro-
blem ... and took steps to correct 
it," added Hull. "I just absolutely 
believe there was no pressure to 
do this." 

Media Center Director Sher-
man George gave a similar answer, 
denying that any pressure was 
exerted on the University; "If there 
was a complaint, I would know 
about it." 

When asked why the Univer-
sity had just decided to require the 
disclaimers, George answered that 
"There was a suggestion from the 
Vice-Chancellor's office [of aca-
demic affairs] that it would be a 
good time." 

Other professors offered dif-
ferent information. Fred Lonid-

ier, a visual arts professor who 
works with the "Labor Link"T. V. 
project and who supervised Par-
man's production, told of receiv-
ing calls from concerned Univer-
sity officials. 

". was called by the chair of the 
communications department one 
morning and asked if the com-
munications department was in

Bush to 
Speak at 
Scripps 
Tomorrow 
Republican presidential can-

didate George Bush will make an 
unexpected campaign stop at 
U CS D tomorrow, but the general 
student body is apparently not 
invited. 

The Vice President will speak 
on the Scripps Institution of Ocean-
ography campus down the hill at 
3:30 pm to an audience of some 
Scripps employees, professors and 
graduate students according to 
Bush advance man John Herrick. 

Some tickets will be made avail-
able to the public, but no method 
of disbursing them had been set-
tled at press time Wednesday 
night. 

There is also no word on wh~t 
Bush will be talking abotli., al-
though education is a strong pos-
sibility. 

He has described a possible

Bush administration as an "educa-
tion presidency," but the Reagan/ 
Bush administration has opposed

ment of Education and cut back 
student loan levels. 

After the speech, expected to 
last twenty minutes or so, Bush 
will speak at a private fund raising 
reception at the Embassy Suites 
Hotel on La Jolla Village Dr. 

"There will be some accom-
modation for protesters, " Harrick 

said, "but we don't know what it 
is yet." 

"We'll probably handle it the 
same way we did [U .S. Senator 
Pete] Wilson 's visit earlier this 
year," Scripps infonnation represen-
tative Chuck Colgan said. 

"There will be room for pro-
testers.

whatever can come here if they 
want." 

Sexual Harassment: Facing UCSD's Problem 
By DENISE DADOR 
Staff Writer 

Editor s note: This is part of a two-part 
examination of sexual harassment on 
campus. Part-two will run on Monday, 
Oct. 17. 

A recent disciplinary case against a 
UCSD professor has raised questions 
about the prevalence of sexual harass-
ment on UC campuses, and prompted 
UCSD officials to clarify students' rights 
and provide more support programs. 

Proposed modifications designed to 
simplify lengthy harassment complaint 
procedures, (expected to be approved this 
fall), combined with the addition of the 
Student Awareness Proaram this year, 
exemplifying the University's desire to 
address the problem. 

"The university takes a very strict posi-
tion in not condoning luch conduct," 

said Nicholas Aguilar, Director of Spe-
cial Services. 

"If an individual is determined to be 
engaged in this kind of behavior, he will 
be subject to disciplinary action," he said., 

One such individual, 37-year-old Paolo 
M. Dau, an assistant professor of philo-
sophy, was denied a tenured position as a 
result of proven complaints that he haras-
sed three women graduate students in 
June 1985. 

After repreated investigations and 
hearings that dralled on for 3~ years, 
Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson us-

pended Dau without pay for the spring 
1988 quarter. 

Dau, who is currently on sabbatical, is 
expected to teach for one more year at 
UCSD . . 

ON 
, · ·· · , C~QS 

Assistant vice chancellor Thomas Hull 
explained in a written statement to the 
Guardian that the Committee of Prive-
lege &: Tenure: established that harass-
ment charges against Dau were proven to 
be valid, and that he was in violation of 
the Faculty Code of Conduct. 

The code, adopted by the Academic 
Senate, clearly Itatea that a faculty 

member who initiates a personal rela-
tionship with a current student harboring 
romantic or sexual implications can 
seriously compromise the student-teacher 
relationship. 

UCSD information officers pointed 
out that the term "sexual harassment" 
encompasses any unwanted attention of 
a sexual nature directed at a student in an 
academic environment that creates a hos-
tile atmosphere and interferes with the 
student's academic performance. 

Nancy Wahlig, coordinator of the 
Student Safety Awareness Program, 
described harassers as persons who are 
normally in positions of power over 
other people. 

Such job descriptions include profes-
sors, teachiDg assistants, resident assist-
ants and supervisors of student employ-
ees.

Political Film Series 
Focuses on Chile 

The Committee for World Democracy will present 
the third showing in their series of films this week. 

This week the ftlms focus on Chile. The first film 
shown will be "Chile: Hasta Cuando?" (" How much 
longerj. For security reasons, director David Brad-
bury told Chilean authorities he was visiting their 
country to make a film on music and religion. But his 
real intent was blatantly political; to see what life was 
like under the dictatorship and to assess the possibili-
ties for a return to democracy. It records economic 
and political repression as well as courageous 
opposition. 

The second movie that will be shown is titled 
"Church of Liberation." This film is an overview of 
the "popular church," its transformation into "opting 
for the poor," and what it implies for different sectors 
of Brazilian society. This film is about Liberation 
Theology and also an informative documentary about 
the recent history of Brazil.

modification, nicotine gum and group support, and 
gives special attention to preventing relapse. New 
groups are formed periodically. 

UC Faculty Research Grant 
Applications Due December 1 

The California Policy Seminar is seeking proposals 
from University of California faculty for research on 
issues relevant to the state. 

Grant decisions will be made by the Seminar's 
steering committee early in the Spring of 1989. Dead-

by Berke Breathed 

line for receipt of proposals by the seminar is Dec. I, 
1988. Proposals must be submitted via the various 
campus and laboratory Contract and Grants 'Offices 
which may have earlier deadlines. 

Established in 1977, the seminar links the system-
wide resources of the university with the public policy 
needs of state government through research support 
and through technical assistance involvina conferen-
ces, seminars, data analyses, and publications. 

Since its founding, the seminar has funded research 
in a number of areas important to California includ-
ing agriculture and water resources, economic devel-
opment, education and child care, human services, 
immigration, mental health and natural resources. 

Over the past two years research projects have 
addressed issues ranging from the ecology of Mono 
Lake and state health care polices to the impact of 
immigration reform on seasonal agricultural workers. 
This year, special preference will be given to three 
"priority" areas of research chosen by the seminar's 
steerina committee. These areas include the implica-
tions of demographic chanae for state policy, espe-
cially as it pertains to ethnic minorities, children and 
youth, the aaed, and the homeless; California's ec0-
nomic future; and increasing aovernmental 
effectiveness. 

Proposals will also be accepted in other policy 
areas. However, such proposals must describe their 
importance to California and relevance to state 
policy. 

]n addition, the seminar has established a new 
awards category to encourage faculty workina on 
large projects (not necessarily specific to the state) to 
write policy papers addressing the implications of 
their research for California. 

Guidelines, application forms and information on 
SUbmitting either research or special award proposals 
may be obtained from the California Policy Seminar,

Med School Faculty Distinguished 

, Lecture Series Continues 
Jerrold M. Olefsky, M.D., professor of medicine at 

the UCSD School of Medicine, will present "Type II 
Diabetes: Lessons from Clinical Research and Molec-
ular Biology" as the second lecture of the school's 
1988-89 Faculty Distinguished Lecture Series on 
Thursday, Oct. 20. The lecture will begin at 4:30 p.m. 
in the Leonard Garren Auditorium in the Basic 
Science Building at UCSD and will be broadcast live 
to the UCSD Medical Center Auditorium 'in Hillcrest. 
A reception will follow in the Dean's Office Lobby. 

Olefsky will discuss the role of molecular biology in 
understanding how defects on the surface of some 
cells keep the human body from using insulin prop-
erly, causing diabetes, 

Olefsky is one of the country's leading investigators 
in the field of diabetes. He is head of the division of 
endocrinology I metabolism at the medical school, and 
chief of the Metabolic Section and director of the 
Special Diagnostic and Treatment Unit at the Vete-
rans Administration Medical Center in La Jolla. He 
has published nearly 250 articles in the field of endo-
crinology, most of which deal with metabolism and 
diabetes. Along with a highly-respected team of 
researchers and clinicians, he has conducted extensive 
studies on Type 11 diabetes mellitus, which is often 
related to obesity and can usually be managed by diet 
or agents that lower blood sugar. 

'Safe Halloween' Booklet to 
Benefit Easter Seal Program 

Because of their concern for the safety of San Die-
go's children, the Chargers support Easter Seal's "Safe 
Halloween" community service project. 

"Safe Halloween" was developed to allow children 
to "trick or treat" without the fear of receiving tainted 
candy. Easter Seals produces booklets containing 
coupons for free "treats" from local businesses that 
are absolutely safe as they are redeemed by the child-
ren at the business locations. 

~he booklets are sold for SI by the participating 
bus messes and other concerned civic groups. They 
include coupons for pius, corn dogs, tacos, frozen 
yogurt, and amusements. The total value of this year's 
booklet is $26. 

Since its inception six years ago, Safe Halloween 
~as raised over $354,620 to support Easter Seal pro-
gram for children and adults with disabilities in San 
qiego County.

any way identified in [Parman's] 
program. Later that day, [Assis-
tant Chancellor] Roy Ritchie 
called me; he wanted to know if 
he could see the tape," Lonidier 
said . 

"It is curious as to why the Uni-
versity moved so quickly in this 
case - and I'm curious. When the 
chair of the department calls you, 
and then the vice chancellor calls 
you - gee, you get the feeling that 
there's pressure behind it," Lonid-
ier continued. 

Professor Daniel Hallin, acting 
chair of the communication de-
partment, explained why he called 
Lonidier: "The Chancellor's office 
called me and said that they had a 
complaint. [Apparently] there was 
a complaint to the Chancellor's 
office from someone connected 
with the San Diego Union." 

"I think that, obviously enough, 
this is a case of the University 
running up against a powerful 

institut ion in San Diego," Hallin 
continued. 

This appears to contradict 
Sherman George's earlier state-
meR! that he would have known 
about any complaint; Lonidier 
offered a possible explanation for 
the di sc repancy . "Sherman 
George told me there has been 
some pressure on him as a result 
of this incident," said Lonidier. 

"There is a real question as to 
whether some institutions and 
some people have greater access 
[to UCSD policymaking]," Lon-
idier added ; "I think that a public 
institution has to be protected 
from special interests." 

While the Guardian has learned 
that the Union-Tribune has made 
at least one monetary contribu-
tion to UCSD in the last year, 
Chancellor Atkinson denies that 
any undue influence was exer-
cised. 

"We expect every major corp or-
ation in town to make contribu-
tions," he said . 

"] don 't know who called," 
Atkinson said . "There's no ques-
tion that our interest [in the dis-
claimer issue] was piqued by a 
complaint. [But] J don't see it as 
some devious development ," he 
concluded.

Harassment 
Continued from pale I 
effects on its victims," Wahlig 
said. "It often results in students 
leaving school, failing exams and 
feeling anxiety and confusion." 

She explained that often stud-
ents do not realize they are being 
harassed or else they will tend to 
minimize the situation becuase 
they are afraid of jeopardizing 
their grades or recommendations. 

Aguilar noted that students 
should not fear for their grades 
when reportinga harasser, because 
the University is obliged to ensure 
the student will not be further 
victimized. 

"The important thing is to make 
sure the student tells someone 
about it," he said. "It is unfair to 
ask the University to correct 
something it has no knowledge 
about." 

One student, who did not want 
to be identified, recalled that one 
of her professors had been con-
sistently complimenting her on 
her looks and personality before 
he finally approached her and 
asked her out on a date. 

Although the student was wor-
ried that she would offend her 
professor she "told him exactly 
where we stood. J said, I'm a 
student and you're the teacher 
and we hould keep it on that 
level. " 

Although anecdotal evidence 
cites several instances of professor 

initiating some involvement with 
their students, with higher occur-
rences in graduate studies prog-
rams, the consensus among cam-
pus professors is that romantic 
overtures directed toward pupils 
is destructive to both parties. 

. Literature professor Jack Behar 
said university codes prohibit such 
behavior. 

"It's a bad idea for all the 
obvious reasons," he said. 

Mathematics assistant professor 
Bruce K. . Driver acknowledged 
that such unprofessional conduct 
is damaging to traditional student-
teacher relationships. 

441 don't agree with it, ] think it's 
a conflict of interests," 

Wahlig said that students 
should exercise their rights and 
not allow themselves to be sub-
jected to any behavior of that 
sort. 

Most women who 
experience harass-
ment tend to blame 
themselves for what 
their professors did. 

"It's imponant to realize that 
sexual harassment is illegal. Stud-
ents have the right to work and 
study in a stress-free atmosphere," 
she said. 

Most women who experience 
harassment tend to blame them-
selves for what their professors 
did. Wahligexplained that victims 

sometimes feel that it was some-
thing they did or the way they 
dressed that encouraged their 
professors' behavior. 

It 's important to realize who's 
responsible for it. Who is being 
abusive of their power?" 

A pamphlet put together by the 
Student Safety Awareness Pro-
gram identified several forms of 
harassment which included sug-
gestive or insulting sounds, offen-
sive or derogatory jokes or com-
ments, leering or ogling at private 
parts and attempted or actual 
fondlin~ or kissing. 

Wahlig stressed the importance 
of knowing what harassment is 
because the ability to identify the 
problem will be beneficial once 
students leave college and enter 
the workplace. 

She also added that in many 
instances harassers are not aware 
that their behavior is inappropri-
ate. 

" If a harasser is bothering you, 
he probably has been harassing 
other people and is getting away 
with it. He may not know that he 
is doing it ... that's why we all need 
to learn." 

Sexual harassment has only 
been gainina attention on Ameri-
can coflege campuses in recent 
years, according to Pat Kitcher, a 
philosophy professor and chair of 
the statewide Committee on the 
Status of Women. 

"It's something that people have 
known about for years. But only 
recently have people begun to 
realize that it's the university's

G ood old George. He's always happy, always ready to smile - even when it hurts , like it did in San Antonio last 
night when he had to meet the press and say how elated he was 

after watching his running mate blow a 5-point hole in whatever slim 
margin the Bush-Quayle ticket was nursing until they sent a silly, rich, 
little frat boy out on national TV to claim he was just about the same 
thing as Jack Kennedy. 

The crowd laughed harshly, almost stunned by the dumbness of it , 
and the TV camera showed Lloyd Bentsen licking his chops and 
smiling savagely as poor Dan Quayle continued to jabber distractedly 
at both monitors; he had wandered away from his script and now he 
was lost, out of the channel, wallowing frantically in the shallows of his 
own mind ... His little blue eyes glazed over and his chin jutted out 
toward the camera as the wave curled down on him. 

It was one of those magic moments in politics that come aJong once 
in a lifetime, and Bentsen understood: He had the little bugger by the 
throat - and it had come with no warning, like some accidental 
delivery by the stork ... Not even honest politicians deserve a gift so 
precious as the one Quayle dropped in Bentsen's lap Wednesday night: 

'" have as much experience in the Congress," he said, "as Jack 
Kennedy did when he sought the presidency." 

What? It seemed impossible. A strange hush fell on the studio 
audience fora moment and then came the laughter. It was as if they had 
just heard some giddy bimbo like Mike Tyson's wife compare herself to 
Katharine Hepburn ... Quayle had gone over the line, and the real 
horror was that he didn't grasp it. His ha lf-bright little eyes wandered 
fearfully back and forth around the room as the dull hiss of the crowd 
grew louder and uglier. They didn't like him, for some reason, but he 
knew he had done something wrong. 

A nd he was not alone. Quayle's hideous perception was shared in many high places. George Bush, watching the debate on a 
cheap-looking 16-inch TV set in a motel room near San Anto-

nio, gnashed his teeth and cursed the doomed roots of whatever demon 
instinct had caused him to think he could wrap a handsome little 
albatross like Danny Quayle around his neck and still swim in the fast 
lane of presidential politics. 

The rest is low history - but it counts, and Bentsen seized on his 
jewel with a zeal that will probably go down as the highest thing he ever 
did in this world. His response to Quayle's blunder was the first real 
peak in this wretched campaign since Dole lost New Hampshire ... 

"Senator," he said, "I served with Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was 
a friend of mine ... and Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy." 

Whack! And that was that. Quayle protested limply, but by that time 
even he understood that he had somehow, with one stupid yelp, 
confirmed the worst fears of all those who had called him a rare and 
noble exception to the old dictum that says "you can't make a silk purse 
out of a sow's ear." 

I t was a bad shock for George and the White House crowd. They were riding high before Omaha, and even James Baker, the 
acknowledged central intelligence of the Bush campaign, who 

never liked the idea of putting Quayle on the ticket in the first place, 
was finally beginning to think that maybe they were going to get away 
with it. 

They had, after all, survived the nightmare of shame and public 
exposure that followed Quayle's selection and caused even Bush to 
wonder about dumping him. 

.. . But no, the rain of manure had not come. It was a miracle. Even 
Raker rolled his eyes when the first polls taken after the convention 
showed the hare-brained BUSh-Quayle marriage was so popular that 
the GOP ticket had surged ahead of Dukakis-Bentsen. 

It was awesome. The national media called it a bad Robert Redford 
joke and even high Republican wizards like Baker and Lyn Nofziger 
shook their heads sadly ... 

It wastoo much of an insult to the "women's vote," they said. It was 
impossible that the same women who had chuckled and slapped each 
other on the back every time they heard the cigarette ads cooing 
"You've come a long way, baby" might fall so heavily for a low-rent 
plastic Robert Redford doll that the whole 10 million vote "gender 
gap to would disappear overnight and make Quayle the best thing that 
happened to the GOP ticket since Gary Hart ran wild in Bimini last 
year. 

But it was true. The numbers on the women's vote shifted 12 points 
away from Dukakis in less than a week after what the press and the 
pros called "the debacle" in New Orleans ... Nobody knows why it 
happened; it was a horrible thing to see. 

Many women called it impossible and cursed me for talking about it, 
but the figures were firm and the once-menacing "gender gap" has not 
been mentioned by anybody since it shrunk 12 points after Quayle was 
put on the ticket. 

Who knows? But I am a gambler and I was very depressed by the 
shrinkage. It made Bush the front-runner, and 1 have made some heavy 
bets against that. Bijt the polls are fickle , like women, and I knew that 
even a wombat could make figures on public opinion if the results came 
with a "margin of error" asterisk. of 4.8 percent in a close race. 

That is what we have now. Not even Patrick Buchanan will claim 
that Quayle's performance in Omaha was less than a 5-point disaster 
for the GOP ticket. . . and that makes it about 49-49 right now - so 
that two percent "undecided" will probably decide the election. 

And if it goes wrong for me, I want everyone of those cheap, flaky 
bastards who don't vote on Nov. 8 to know that they are the real swine 
in this queasy generation, and if there is any justice in this world , and 
they will be hunted down like fat animals in winter and chopped into 
stinking offal. 

Letters 
Don't Punish 
A.S. Success 
Editor: 

As an assistant manager of the 
Grove Cam;, I was intrigued by 
Bard-Alan Finlan's letter admon-
ishing the Caffe's success (Guar-
dian, Oct. 10). There are several 
discrepancies regarding the goals 
and status of the Grove. 

Foremost, the prices at the 
Grove are, on average, 50 percent 
less than our off-campus proto-
types. As anyone who frequents 
such coffee houses as the Pan-
nikin, Java, Gelato Vera or Gelare 
knows, a single cappuccino, for 
example, costs between SI .45 and 
$\.60; a double size of the same 
costs between SI .85 and 52.95. 

Compare that to S\.OO and 
$ 1.65, respectively, at the Grove. 
These cost differences are consid-
erable. Taking into account the 
cost of raw materials, it is evident 
that the Grove is not charging an 
inord inate amount. 

Regarding the styrofoam cup 
issue, the problem is litter rather 
than styrofoam waste. The hazar-
dolL'i elements objected to by environ-
mentalists are the chlorofluoro-
carbons (CFCs), an ingredient in 
many styrofoams but not one 
found in the cups used by the 
Grove. 

The A.S. mandate for relin-
quishing styrofoam cup usage by 
campus food services included a 
clause preserving the use of styro-
foam for hot drinks. While search-
ing for an alternative that will 
aJlow the containment of hot liq-
uids without melting or falJing 
apart (as did the paper cups used 
when the Grove first opened), the 
Grove is permitted the use of sty-
rofoam by the A.S. Council. 

Finally, considering the Grove's 
status as a student enterprise -
not a co-op - that is included as 

part of a whole, it has not profited 
for itself, but for all the A .S. 
services. 

In light of the losses acquired 
by A.S. Lecture Notes and As-
sorted Vinyl last year, the finan-
cial gains of the Grove served to 
subsidize those other operations. 

Moreover, by reinvesting its 
profits in Grove expansion, the 
Caffe will be accommodating 
more students and their needs 
with a bigger space in order to 
better serve them. 

The ' Grove has done smash-
ingly well and made huge profits 
in its two years of business. The 
Grove will respond to that mes-
sage by putting its gains into giv-
ing the students what they want. 

Why punish A.S. successes? 
Perhaps that is the burning issue.

'Locker Room' 
Talk is 
Out of Place 
Editor: 

I wish to express disappoint-
ment at your "Editor in a Box" 
commentary about (at least in the 
beginning) trying to win the affections of a woman who had a 
distant boyfriend in Spain (Guardian, Oct. 3). 

In doing so, the writer created a situation to which many can 
relate. No doubt many can rela te to the inescapable cycle of 
pursuit and evasion he described . Many understood the tor-
moment he felt when he saw "evidence of their love" in the form 
of "copious correspondence." 

Toward the end of this column, however, something went 
terribly wrong. For some odd reason, the writer felt it necessary 
to communicate his sexual habits. "I always sleep with someone 
on the first date. Ca\1 me loose," he wrote. 

Don't get me wrong. The sexual habits / history of the writer 
neither interest nor impress me. Rather, I can not help but 
question why the writer included this. 1 understand the author's 
point, but the excessive dwelling on this is out of place. 

Was that rea\1y a necessary point, or simply attached to feed 
the author's ego? 

Overall, J was disappointed with the reduction of this article 
from a sincere and sensitive work to "locker room talk." I am not 
questioning the right of the writer to include these tedious tidbits 
in his articles, but' simply don 't see their relevance in this article.

OPINION 

Beer Won't 
Cure Apathy 
Editor: 

After the disastrous B.G.I.F. 
on Sept. 30, and then a cover-up 
by Programming Commissioner 
Jonathan Judaken, , might refer 
to" A.S." as Associated Swindlers 
rather than Associated Students. 
Another example is the use of reg-
istration fees paid by the student 
body to provide beer for a select 
few . 

J applaud our programming 
commissioner on a classic politi-
cal move: after admitting (Guar-
dian. Oct. 3) that the problem of 
the first TG of the year was "a 
whole lot of drunk people not 
thinking for themselves," he 
pushes a SI4,OOO beer budget 
through the A.S. 

His explanation in the com-
mentary "Herd Mentality at the 
BGIF" is that a "mob mentality" 
was to blame for the early end to 
the concert, but such a mentality 
signifies a beginning to a "revolu-
tion against apathy" at UCSD. 
The fact that over $ 14,000, half of 
the $28,000 programming budget, 
was allotted for beer for TGs (not 
including the thousands in pro-
gramming costs) will not improve 
the apathy of students at UCSD 
for two reasons. 

First , half of the $28,000 pro-
gramming budget goes to serve a 
fraction ofthe student body. Only 
5,000 turned out at the last TG, 
and of that number, many were 
reported to be non-students. As-
suming that students under 21 are 
not served alcohol, I do not find 
providing beer for a portion of 

students a solution to apathy of 
the campus as a whole. Aren't we 
forgetting those under drinking 
age? , call it a n excuse. 

It 's an excuse Judaken would 
like to blame on Chancellor 
Atkinson. The lack of proper 
facilit ies (i.e., an amphitheater) 
somehow causes these failures at 
TGIF, Judaken says. After Sept . 
30th, it is no wonder Atkinson 
does not approve an amphitheater. 

I find it personally insulting, as 
others. do, to be called apathetic 
by my A.S. for not participating 
in beer brawls. "Students who are 
nightmares oft he administration, ft 
as Judaken calls those who stand 
up against stagnancy by partying 
might be a part of the A.S., but r 
do not find many in the student 
body. 

Thursday. October /3. /988 ~ 

Secondly, apathy will only be 
cured by support of the under-
funded student organizations that 
potentially represent all of the 
students rather than a select few. 
With over half of the $28,000 
budget going toward beer, stu-
dent organizations are nearly 
starved of necessary funds . The 
Student Advocate Office, a liai-
son between students and the 
administration, receives merely 
$350 for its total operating budget. 
Student organizations provide the 
education and "exchange of ideas 
outside the classroom, ft not a good 
drunk. ~ 

$ 14,000 on beer? , call on A.S. 
President Maynard Dimmesdale 
to reconsider.

What? No Bumper Stickers? 
Editor. 

You know what is interesting about this presidential race? No 
bumper stickers! 

Think about it. NormaUy, bumpers would be covered by now 
with Bush or Dukakis ads. Not so this time. 

111 bet I've seen more bumper stickers for little-known Liber-
tarian candidate Ron Paul than for either of the old-line party 
candidates. 

N<> one seems to be/or 6.nybody in this race. Everyone talks 
about planning to vote X only to try to keep even worse Y from 
being elected. This is one time we really need the choice none 0/ 
the above on the ballot. I think J'mgoingto vote for the libertar-
ians as a protest vote.

Mediation: Alternative to Legal Battles Continued from page 3 obligation to fix it," she aid . 

Kitcher explained that part of 
the problem may lie with inad-
vertent role switching between the 
professor and pupil. She said that 
teachers have specific responsibili-
ties to their students. 

By BRUNA DARINI 
Contributing Writer 

Relief is in sight. Disputing 
students can now turn to 
UCSD Student Mediator Ser-
vices for arbitration of com-
mon disagreements. 

Through the use of a third 
party, two or more individ uals 
may resolve interpersonal con-
flict by seeking an arbitrary 
solution. 

"People can allow emotions 
to get the best of them without 
ever confronting the source of 
the anger .. ... sophomore and 
student mediator Marisa 
Smith said . 

"Mediation brings people 
together- to say what needs 
to be said." 

Battles over debts, mi nor 
accidents, and property dam-
age may also be settled. Medi-
ation can be an alternative to 
small claims court, according 
to senior Damon Bell, co-
chairman of mediation. 

"It's a non-legal way to solve 
problems. Students can avoid 
the expense and hassle of court 
with our free service ... the 
people involved make their 
own resolution rather than a 
judge making one for them," 
Bell said . 

Initially, students bring in 

their problems to Mediation 
ervice , located in Student 

Center Building B. Each case 
is assigned two trained medi-
ators and an observer. 

In one or two private ses-
sions, a non-binding agree-
ment is generally reached and 
two follow-up sessions are 
scheduled. 

"The agreements are not 
legally binding, but if people 
come willingly to a resolution, 
t here is no reason to break it," 
Smith said . 

"I'd recommend the service 
for anyone with any kind of 
dispute, because little things 
can eventually lead to larger 
problems,"juniorstudent me-
diator Peter Emblat said. 

One recent example of ten-
sions involved two students 
living in the campus dorms. 
The two students disliked each 
other and constantly pulled 
pranks on each other. Finally, 
a physical confrontation en-
sued. Mediation Services was 
able to help alleviate the 
hostility. 

"I can't mention the details 
because of confidentiality ... in 
this case we had two human 
beings who never talked but 
were doing horrible things to 
each other. .. " Smith said . 

"By communicating, both 
came out of mediation feeling 
much better, and they were 
satisfied with their decision." 

Student Mediation Services 
was developed a s an alterna-
tive to Legal Services. Pre-
viously, students who sought 
help to resolve differences 
before filing legal complaints

were referred 10 the downtown 
Community Mediations Servi-
ces, which proved inconven-
ient. 

Headed by Tom Walsh, a 
Muir Resident House Advisor, 
Carrie Wilson, Counseling 
Attorney for Legal Services, 
and Susan Quinn, Mediation 
Services Coordinator, the pro-
gram evolved. Co-sponsors 
include: Associated Students, 
Office of the Vice Chancellor 
for Undergraduate Affairs, 
Housing and Food Services, 
the College Councils and Stu-
dent Legal Services. 

"The students created the 
need and actually should take 
credit for starting the pro-
gram," Wilson said. 

Currently, the Mediation 
Services consists of 15 students 
and five staff mediators. They 
undergo 23 hours of extensive 
training by the San Diego 
Community Mediations Serv-
ices who have provided the 
oversight for the campus based 
program. 

" It's a wonderful program 
that will help students learn 
how to relate with people and 
deal with their own situations 
throughout life," Quinn said. 

Students interested in Media-
tion Services can call the office 
at 534-4443 for more infor-
mation. 

She concluded that sometimes 
professors will misperceive the 
situation and expect more from 
their pupils. . 

"Students are only expected to 
go to class, do their work and be 
attentive. They're not there to 
please the teacher," she said. 

Students who feel they might 
have been victims of harassment 
are urged to seek out and speak 
with information officers located 
at several student support centers, 
including Student Legal Services, 
the Student Safety Awareness 
Program, the Office of Graduate 
Studies and Psychology and Coun-
seling Services, among others. 

Part of an ongoing educational 
effort to inform students about 
the issue will be a sexual harass-
ment workshop on October 27 
sponsored by the Student Safety 
Awareness Program. The work-
shop will run from 2 pm t~3 :30 
pm at the North Conference 
Room of the Student Center. 

"This kind of thing could be 
happening everyday," Wahlig said. 
"It's important for [victims] to 
know that support programs like 
these exist and that there is 
someone on campus students can 
turn to."

Affirmative Action Endures 

UCSD's Program Survives Criticism 
By BRIAN ITOW 
Slaff Writer 

"College has taught me to be 
prejudiced," Lisa Smith, a 20-
year-old junior said. "I don't care 
about color in high school, but 
now that I see all the things that I 
can't have because ['m white, I've 
learned to be prejudiced. That's 
really sad, it's really sad that one 
thin~ I've learned at UCSD is to 
be prejudiced." 

In the Bakke decision of 1978, 
the Supreme COlJrt struck down 
the use of admissions quotas and 
special hirings to reach parity, but 
it did allow for the use of ethnicity 
to determine which qualified ap-
plicants are admitted or hired. 

UCSD admits the top 12.S per-
cent of high school students in 
California. Of 19,129 applications 
received for Fall , 1988, about 

\ook a t w"'~"'~ 
\ ook:fAWAi 

18,000 fell in the top 12.S percent 
and were considered for admis-
sion. The other 1,000 fell below 
that group and were automatically 
rejected unless a case could be 
made for special admission. 

UCSD does not look at eth-
nicity when reviewing most of its 
applications. It automatically ac-
cepts every student with a GPA of 
3.8 and SAT scores over 1100 to 
fill half of the 10,387 applicant 
acceptance pool (applicants who 
will eventually decide whether or 
not to accept the U niversit 's invi-
tation). 

To fill the other half of the 
acceptance pool, the admissions 
office looks at additional factors , 
including ethnicity. 

It is necessary to consider fac-
tors other than straight GPA and 
SAT scores because the "tests have 
their biases against ethnic minor-
ities. The people who formulated

the SATs and the GREs have 
already decided that we are one 
standard deviation below the 
norm, that we are genetically in-
ferior. They don't take into con-
sideration cultural values when 
devising the tests:' Dennard Clen-
denin, the coordinator of Student 
Affirmative Action at UCSD said. 

One of the goals of affirmative 
action IS to attain a group of 
students at UCSD that is propor-
tional to the ethnic makeup of the 
graduating classes of California 
high schools, according to Ronald 
Bowker, atlmissions director and 
registrar at UCSD. 

In 1986, 27.7 percent of the 
state's high school graduates were 
under-represented minorities 
(Black, Latino or American In-
dian). By contrast, only 14.4 per-
cent of UC students were from 
this group. 

In order to help balance these 
numbers, the University of Califor-
nia automatically admitted under-
represented minority students if 
they met the U C Admissions Index 
standards. 

So, under-represented minority 
students were admitted with a 
lower GP A (3.SI) than white stu-
dents (3 .76), although they still 
graduated in the top 12.5 percent 
of their high school classes. The 
University of California follows 
these procedures in order to diver-
sify the campus and comply with 
state regulations, according to 
Bowker. 

An aspect of Affirmative Action 
that continually draws fire from 
some white students and faculty is 
the Educational Opportunity Pro-
gram (EOP), which admits a small 
percentage of students who do 
not meet the requirement that 
they rank in the top 12.5 percent. 
The purpose of EOP is to allow 
students to overcome barriers that 
would otherwise prevent them 
from attending school at the 
University of California. Critics 
of the program call it a "free meal 
ticket .. for "u ndeservi ng" minority 
students. 

"We need to eliminate the ques-

tion of race from the application 
process," said Mark Phillips, a 
19-year-old sophomore. "Most pre-
judice would disappear if we dis-
regarded a person's name and 
race and simply used his social 
security number. Then no one 
would wonder if another person 
was admitted because of his eth-
nicity. " 

Ninety percent of those polled 
assumed that all students admit-
ted under this program are minor-
ities. Actually, the program app-
lies to anyone with a hardship 
that may prevent them from being 
accepted. In 1986, a majority of 
the students admitted through the 
program were white. 

The ignorance of issues dis-
played in white students' opinions 
about the Affirmative Action 
Program depicts one of the main 
causes of racism on campus and 
in the United States, according to 
Billy Vaughn, a visiting professor 
of Communications who taught 
at UCSD last spring. 

"Racism on campus is basically 
all about affirmative action and 
who gets a piece of the pie. White 
students are very angry at the fact 
that they might not get into law 
school - even if they have the 
ability and the achievement scores, 
although highly competitive slots 
are given to ethnics with lower 
test scores than theirs. They have 
a lack of understanding about the 
disparity in the United States. In 
fact, they don't want to under-
stand. All they want is their own 
opportunity and, to a certain 
extent, you can't blame them." 

"A vast majority of those stu-
dents we bring in have the grades 
and, once in, they have to per-
form just like everyone else. 
Affirmative Action does favor a 
certain group and the process 
does close off a few avenues to the 
dominant group, but you would 
be hard-pressed to prove the 
dominant group is underrepre-
sented in anything. 

"Reverse discrimination is ano-
ther attempt to drum up hysteria.

Most whites don't know about it 
and just see it as an easy way for 
minority students to get into the 
university," said Oendenin. 

"They don't realize that minor-
ity students got good grades in 
high school too. Students of color 
have to become more aware of 
what's going on. They have to be 
more assertive. There are some 
students who are afraid of being 
labeled "Affirmative Action" 
because they don't want to be 
stigmatized; they shouldn't feel 
that way. That's just blaming the 
victim, just listening to the argu-
ments of the dominant culture, 
which is exactly what they want. 
They want us to attribute our suc-
cess to reasons other than who we 
are." 

The retention rate of students 
admitted under affirmative action 
is slightly lower than that of white 
students. Of the students who 
entered UCSD as frosh in the fall 
quarters of 1982, 1983 and 1984, 
70 percent were still in school two 
years later. However, only 63 per-
cent of the affirmative action stu-
dents attended for two years. 

According to Barbara Sanchez, 
a Latino professor of literature at 
UCSD, "the law retention rate is 
due to the University'S lack of 
support and activities for the 
under-represented minority." 

"Many minority students come 
into the University without the 
necessary background preparation 
and no effort is made to train 
them in the areas they're lacking. 
The high schools in the barrios 
and ghettos are not up to par. 
They don't even provide the same 
curriculum as the high schools in 
more affluent areas. 

"Biology in East San Diego 
and Biology in La 10lla are two 
entirely different classes. If a stu-
dent gets an .. A" from Biology in 
East San Diego, he still won't 
come to UCSD with the same 
preparation as the students in La 
10lla, so he might lack some of 
the skills to take a particular class 
here. But, he can develop the 
skills as long as he has the sup-
port. The University needs to re-
cognize that, but it doesn't. It says 
'we're not in the area of remedial 

education.' They have to realize 
that it's not remedial education. 
It's additional support," Sanchez 
said . 

One of the barriers that con-
fronts minority students is the 
small percentage of UC full-time 
minority faculty. 

Without a proportionate num-
ber of faculty, a minority student 
often does not have the same sup-
port network that the white stu-
dent does. 

According to Sanchez, many 
minorities don't go in to see their 
white professors or use OASIS, 
UCSD's tutorial service, because 
they fear being subjected to forms 
of subtle racism. 

"The fact that only 10 percent 
of the faculty are minorities, 
teaching at a school with about 40 
percent minorities, it is not repre-
sentative, it's benign neglect. 

By the year 2000 it's estimated 
that over 50 percent of California 
will be non-white," Clenendin 
said . 

"If you look. at our staff you'] 
find minorities huddled into the 
lower paying jobs - the entry 
and service level positions ," said 
Nolan Penn, an associate chan-
cellor for all matters regarding 
affirmative action. "But, on the 
managerial level - the Depart-
ment heads, etc. - you 11 find 
very few minorities." 

While minorities comprise a 
large percentage of the lower staff, 
they hold few lower level faculty 
positions, according to Penn. "We 
have a core of minority faculty," 
he said, "but the problem is that 
we need faculty at all levels. We 
have a number of minorities in 
tenured positions but few in the 
non-tenured ladder rank posi-
tions. 

It usually takes up to eight 
years to earn tenure. Since many 
tenured faculty will be retired in 
10 to IS years, we need larger 
numbers of young ladder rank 
minorities so we don't see a big 
drop-off when the older faculty 
begins to retire. 

"There are a number of de-
partments on campus that have 
no minorities," complained San-
chez. "For example, in political 
science and sociology, a number

Israeli Consul Speaks on Conflict 
By VINCENT ANDRADE 
Staff Writer 

The Arab-Israeli Conflict, underscored 
by the ten-month-old uprising in the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, remains 
an unresolved, festering issue. 

The individuals and nations involved 
in the conflict, however, extend beyond 
its political and regional parameters. 

The San Diego Public Affairs Commit-
tee (SAND-PAC), a UCSD student 
organization, represents the concerns of 
pro-Israel students over the formation of 
American foreign policy. The organiza-
tion reflects both the international tone 
of the conflict as well as the close U .S.-
Israel relationship. 

Affiliated with Washington-based 
AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs 
Committee, a non-partisan pro-Israel 
lobby, SAND-PAC's goal is to serve as a 
focus for pro-Israel student political 
action. 

According to Dan Schechter, one of 
the coordinators of SAND-P AC, its role ' 
is to contribute to a more balanced 
presentation of the issues involved in the 
Middle East conflict. 

While discussing the negative press 
which Israel receives in the American 
media, Schechter described the transfor-
mation of Israel from the role of ~under­
dog" to that of an established nation. 
Israel's transition from a new country 
fighting for its survival to an established 
one altered how the American media 
perceived it. Israel went from the role of 
an oppressed group to that of an oppres-
sor, with regards to the occupied terri-
tories of the West Bank and the Gaza 

Strip, Schechter said . 
The effect the media has on the 

American public's opinion of Israel and 
V .S. foreign policy is the chief focus of 
SAND-PAC. 

According to Schechter, Israel's op-
pressive image is a result of its being the 
only Western-style democracy in the 
Middle East. Cultural and geographic 
conflicts result from Israel's location on 
the cusp of the Western and Arab worlds. 
Freedoms of the press are seen as signs of 
a weak government in a political environ-
ment which otherwise denies citizens 
those rights. 

Schechter characterizes SAN D-PAC's 
role as one which "informs people of the 
situation in the Israeli-occupied territories 
and of the role of the P.L.O." 

Schechter also points out that, with 
respect to the Israeli brutality in the 
occupied territories, "What people see 
for twenty seconds every night on the 
media is not presenting the whole picture." 

Ohad Finklestein, deputy consul gene-
ral of Israel, was invited to speak to 
SAND-P AC in order to present this 
"whole picture. to The topics he discussed 
concerned such issues as the need for the 
Arab world to recognize [srael's right to 
exist, Israel's portrayal in the media, and 
the Israeli parliament's upcoming elec-
tions. 

Ohad Finklestein gave a brief history 
of the problems faced by leaders of the 
Arab world when attempts are made to 
recognize Israel. Every leader, Finklestein 
claimed, who has taken a more open view 
towards the state of Israel has lost his 
political power or his life. He cited the 
examples of Anwar el-Sadat and the 
Shah of Iran. Finklestein speculated that,

should Yasir Arafat follow the same 
course of acknowledging the state of 
Israel, he too would perish. 

Finklestein explained that it is the 
moderate, pro-Western Arab leaders who 
would be most willing to deal with Israel, 
which makes them targets for Islamic 
fundamentalists. 

Finklestein expressed the hope that 
another Arab leader would "follow 
[Sadat's] example and come to the negoti-
ation table." He stressed that "the Arab-
Israeli conflict cannot be solved by war." 

Concerning the media, Finldestein 
demanded "that Israel be given more 
credit than the images you see on the 
television." Speaking for Israel, Finkle-
stein asserted, "I recognize the right of all 
Arab countries to exist, but they won't 
recognize [my country.)" 

One thing the deputy consul did not 
emphasize was the possibility of negotia-
ting with Yasir Arafat. Finlclestein cha-
racterized him as "a cold-blooded mur-
derer," and encouraged that we "judge 
him according to the records." 

According to Schechter, the conflict 

• 

between the PLO and Israel is their 
unwillingness to accept any of the U.N. 
resolutions which serve to define Israel as 
a legitimate state. The differences on this 
issue between the two leading parties in 
the Israel parliament, Labor and Likud, 
are in how open each political party is to 
negotiation with Arafat and the PLO. 

The Israeli electorate faces "a choice 
between the [Labor Party's] willingness 
to abandon the Gaza Strip and some 
sections of the West Bank for a peace 
accord, and the refusal of Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Shamir's [Likud party] to con-
template surrendering territory regarded 
as a religious trust," according to the 
New York Times. 

SAND-P AC, being an international 
pro-Israel supporter, lacks the partiiilll 
biases which domestic political differences 
encourage. SAND-PAC emerges as a 
political group much more general in its 
approach. Schechter explains SAND-
PAC's generalized approach as a result 
of being distant and removed from the 
contingencies oflsrael's domestic politics. 

The divergent views within the Knesset, 
Israel's parliament, emphasize the absence 
of simple answers and an ironclad agenda 
in the Arab-Israeli conflict. 

They also emphasize the necessity for 
compromise in the peace-making process. 

In this country and on this campus 
there are several groups which add their 
voices to the dialogue of issues concerned 
with the Arab- Israeli conflict. SAND-
PAC is one whose role as a non-partisan 
lobby is to educate the public and lobby 
Congress for the benefit of American-
Israel relations. For further information 
contact Danny Schechter at 452-3706 or 
Molly Hauser at 587-0727.

Did you watch the American League champion-
ship series this past weekend between the Oakland 
A's and the Boston Red Sox? I thought I watched it. I 
tried to watch it, but T missed it. You missed it too. So 
did ABC Sports. Completely. 

It was bad enough in the first place that ABC 
television unloaded its fifth-rate announcers on us: 

two ex-jocks and an idiot (Joe Morgan, Reggie 
Jackson and Gary Bender), but the viewers also had 
to endure a camera crew and a director "in training." 
Of course, I don't have any facts on this in front of 
me, but I swear the people behind the scenes were 
amateurs. 

To make a long story short, and I don't know who 
to place the blame on. but the camera work was 
awful. The presentation was so lousy, in fact, that it 
even inspired me to jot down instances which help 
illustrate my point. 

I suppose it wouldn't have been so bad, but the 
ABC production blew a number of crucial plays. Let 
me ~ve you a few examples. 

Game Two: Jose Canseco hits a high drive to left 
field in the late innings. Red Sox left-fielder Mike 
Greenwell sets up as if he is going to catch the ball, 
then makes a J 80-degree turn and watches as the ball 
appears to have barely cleared the Green Monster. 

Or did it clear with ease? It was hard to tell, 
because ABC couldn't pick up the ball as it went 
over. As Canseco cleared the bases, I Wflited for the 
replay. And waited. And waited some more. No 
replay, except for a closeup of his swing. I've seen his 
swing. Many times. Maybe they lost the tape. 

Later that game, Dave Parker is called out on a 
close play at second. This time, ABC showed us three 
replays, probably trying to show off how many 
different cameras it had. But of the three angles, none 
showed us whether Parker was safe. 1 was left in a 
confused state. 

In Game Four, a similar thlOg happened when 
Canseco hit his third home run of the series. This 
time, ABC showed the ball flying out of the park, 
out the live coverage showed us a shot of Canseco 
from the Umpire's standpoint. When you watch a 
batter from this angle on TV, it is near impossible to 
judge where a batted ball is traveling. 

There were other screwups worth mentioning, but

Tritons Silence Dominguez Hills 
Twelve Shutouts for Women's Soccer 

By JAME M. BURKE 
Contributing Writer 

Nineteen years. 
In 1969, the Republican VP liability 

was Agnew, not Quayle, the Grateful 
Dead were playing tiny dance halls 
instead of huge auditoriums and the 
Mets were doing alright then, too. 

On a small ut campus in La JoUa, 
a women's soccer program was inaug-
urated, played Cal St . Dominguez 
Hills, and lost. 

Five years later, the team was still 
losing. 

Five years after that, too. 
And five more years. 
The drought finally ended Monday, 

19 years after it started. For the first 
time ever, the women's soccer team 
beat CSDH, using the steel curtain 
defense they've relied on all year to 
win I-{) . 

The only goal of the afternoon 
came mid-way through the second 
half. 

Felicia Faro took the ball from 
CSDH on the UCSD side of the field 
and rambled into Toro territory. 
There, she made a pass that bounded 
off the back of Heather Mauro and 
back to herself. 

Dribbling up the right side of the 
field, Faro "looked for the sag ri.l(ht," 
she said afterward, and found Karin 
Lindsay for a goal on the left side. 

"I just timed my run," Lindsay 
said. "Nobody was there. I was sur-
prised [to be alone] and took two 
touches and kicked it in." 

The goal was the culmination of 
two key maneuvers by Coach Brian 
McManus. 

First, he inserted midfielder Sheila 
Takahashi into the lineup after ruteen 
minutes had elapsed. Coming off an 
injury, it was her most playing time 
this year. 

"The first fifteen minutes, we gave 
them too much respect," McManus 
explained. 

"Sheila's a battle and a buzz-buzz 
player. She set an example for every-
one. After that , we got into the game. 
Today was her day," he said. 

McManus' other move involved 
the substitution of Lindsay for frosh 
sensation Katy Dulock. 

"They're entirely different. Katy's 
good in her own right, but we needed 
something else. Karin has fast timing 
and is good at getting garbage goals. 
She doesn't care and will do anything 
[to win]," McManus said. 

Lindsay, who has played every-
where this season, pointed out that 
CSDH was keying on Dulock. 

Lindsay, however, "ended up in 
front of their goal alone a lot," she 
said. After missing a shot off the post, 
she was alone in front for her goal. 

'" didn't want to miss" the second 
time, she said. 

Toro Coach Marine Cano had he 
team playing aggressively in the first 
half, stressing a score but leaving 

defensive vulnerabilities. 
" We wanted to get the momentum 

..... 'Wni~'P. 

Bryan Bilyeu/ 
Women 's soccer coach Brian McManus tries, unsuccessfully, to count the 
number of times his team has shut out the opponent this season (above) 
... while below, the ferocious Triton defense has forced opposing teams to 
appear off the mark on more than one occasion. 

in the first half. .. we didn't playas 
well in the first half as we played in 
the second half," he said. "Sometimes 
it's just a matter of who gets the 
bounce. " 

"A professional couldn't have made 
a better play" on the UCSD goal, he 
added . "We were caught napping on 
the weak side. We had opportunities, 

Wya" RosentaJ/Gua,dian 
but we didn't produce." 

With four Division I and II 
games remaining, McManus in-
tends to continue Triton pressure 
on the ball, and urges his defense 
to close down angles [on players]. 
"We've had some lapses at times 
this year. We need to work on 
slowing it down up front. We're

not quite as important. Howabout 
the time when Ellis Burks singled, 
and the replay showed a Bob 
Welch fastball from the Goodyear 
blimp in super- low-mo? We never 
even got to see Burks hit the ball. 

And what about the time when 
Boggs threw an A's batter out on 
a ground ball in Game One and 
we were not permitted to see 
Boggs pick up or throw the ball? 

This is not even mentioning the 
countless times when ABC re-
turned from one of those pitiful 
Chevy truck ads and there was 
already either a count on the bat-
ter or the ball was in the air. 

I could have written an entire 
column on the -disgraceful an-
nouncing alone, but it's not even 
worth my time to mitigate an-
nouncers who say the count is 0-2 
when the batter has actually struck 
out (Bender, Game Four), 

Perhaps the lousy coverage was 
epitomized best when, in Game 
Three, the camera view showed 
five people in the stands with the 
words Haywood Sullivan -
Owner. Boston Red Sox beneath. 
This would have been fine if we 
could only tell which one of these 
guys was Sullivan, but there were 
at least three people that could 
have easily been him. Of course, 
the announcing crew didn't clear 
things up. 

The World Series is next. The 
A's may not win it, but at least 
NBC knows how to televise base-
ball. It couldn't be any worse than 
ABC. TBS would have done a 
better job.

trying to play too fast." 

The victory improved the Triton 
record to 13-0-1 this season. Their 
next outing, Saturday against Div, 
II Westmont College at 2 p.m. on 
Warren Field, will be another 
contest which will likely toughen 
the Tritons for post-season play.

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... God knows why a team such as William 
and Mary of Virginia would travel 3,000 miles across the nation 
to face UCSD tomorrow night at 7:00 p.m. in the main gym. 
Evidently, William & Mary's athletic director must have had the 
crazy assumption that a match against a Division III team would 
automatically improve its record, when the contest was sche-
duled a few years ago. Evidently, W & M's athletic director was 
clueless. So what if William & Mary is Division I? First of all, like 
college water polo and baseball, they can't play volleyball on the 
East Coast anyway. Besides, the back-ta-back defending Div-
ision III champion Tritons are just as good, if not better, than 
any Eastern Division 1 team. UCSD is on a roll now at 23-5, and 
will, at the very least, win two games against William & Mary 
(personally, a school I've a/ways wanted to attend.) So ...

1M Volleyball Busting at the Seams 
We knew that the sport of volleyball 

was fast becoming one of the most 
popular team spons on campus. but 
wlfh the fmal results now In. we had no 
Idea the spon of bound·and·pound 
woutd have arrrved as solidly as It has 

With a grand total of 130 men's and 
women 's teams toeing the back line 
thiS quarter and another 36 on the 
wait ing list to play. 1M volleyball has 
qUickly surpassed the sport of softball . 
as the fastest growing and largest 
sport on the 1M menu This quarter's 
130 teams, coupled With another 170 
destined to sign· up In the spring quar· 
terior Coed Volleyball . all but puts vol -
leyball over the magical 300-teams-
per-year mark for the very first time In 
Intramural Spons annals. 

The \lolleyball success story con-
tinues a UCSO Intramural Sports trend 
that has escalated each and every 
year of operation. Team participation 
has increased In each of the prevIous 
15 years at a greater rate than popula-

tlon growth of the campus. 
Although football took a significant 

nosedive in partiCipation, all other 1M 
sports forthe fall quaner broke all· time 
partiCipation records. 

The continued support for 1M sports. 
however. continues to stress the uni-
verSity's ability to house and feed 
them With most Indoor activities at 
near maximum levels. It Will become 
increaSingly more difficult to program 
sports such as basketba" , volleyball . 
lIoor hockey. and water polo without 
additional Indoor faCIlities. 

Ironically. with field sport fac ilities 
now catching up with campus growth 
trends (with the addition of the North 
Campus Recreation field COmplex) it 
is paradOXical that Interest on outdoor 
sports such as footbal l IS on the 
decline. 

The I M-panlcipatlon meter appears 
be low to give you the big picture on

BUD TEAM OF THE WEEK 
Team Tennis got under way this weekend. and 

boy, some of our participants look as they're just a 
step away from joining the ranks of Steffi Graf and 
Andre Agassi. However, a certain team of individ-
uals. the BUBBLE HEADS stood above and 
beyond the rest. They easily defeated the dorm 
team DISCOVE RY 20--4. Led by the strong play 
of Julie Rodriguez and Brett "Stress" Linzer, the 
Bubble Heads launched themselves towards the top 
of the list of early season favorites. 

Well, good luck everybody in your respecti\le 
sports this week. Once again, congratulations 
Bubble Heads, THIS BUD'S FOR YOU.

ne of the more annoying things about movies 
and movie stars is sometimes you can't look at certain 

.rt'nr .. without thinking of some of their past ro 
" One very good example is Judge Reinhold. 

He is a good actor, performing well in 
many movies, including the two Beverly 
Hills Cop movies. But I can't watch him 

without thinking about his masturbating 
scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. 
Sally Field is another actress who fa lls to this 

syndrome. SLone will always picture her as the 
Flying Nun, some as Gidget, So when she attempts 

to portray a struggling comedienne/ housewife 
Lilah Krytsick in the new movie Punchline, she is 

bound to ultimately fail.

Momix is an energetic dance compan, known fOT iu athletic chOTeograph,. 

by isabelle tihanyi 
hiatul aenior.taff writer 

Momix is back! The innovative 
dance group named after a milk 
supplement for veal calves will 
perform for one night only in the 
Mandeville Center Auditorium at 
8 p.m. on Oct. 13. 

Momix is a spin-off of the Pilo-
bolus dance rroupe named for a 
light-sensitive fungus which grows 
on cow manure. It originated as a 
dance solo for the 1980 Winter 
Olympics by the group's founder 
and director, Moses Pendleton. 

Now into its eighth year as one 
of the world's leading dance com-
panies, Momix is, in the words of 

Pendleton, "something that refuses 
to be categorized." Today, aud-
iences have come to recognize 
Momix as an energetic dance 
company, known for its athletic 
choreography. A highly visual 
experience is created using dance, 
mime, and gymnastics. 

With an unprecedented record 
of box office success, Momix has 
toured through Japan, Holland, 
France, England, Italy, Spain, 
lsrad, and Brazil. In North Amer-
ica, Momix has had repeat en-
gagements in almost every major 
city including Toronto, Philadel-
phia, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chi-
cago, Austin, Santa Fe, Denver, 

New York, San Diego, Los 
Angeles, and San Francisco. 

Momix has appeared in several 
commercials for Japanese televi-
sion and has created video and 
slide presentations for its own 
performances. Recent projects 
include a U.S. tour with the New 
Age rock band Shadowfax, and 
debut performances in Sweden 
and Denmark. 

Momix is brought to San Diego 
by UCSD University Events. 
Tickets are available from the 
UCSD Box Office (53+4559) or 
from TicketMaster outlets. Gene-
ral admission is $1 7 , seniors, $15, 
and students, $12.

Sternfeld captures some 
unnoticed ironies 

by mark kenney 
hiatw writer 

Joel Sternfeld has the unusual 
ability to see forgotten or com-
pletely unnoticed ironies in Amer-
ican life. In his color photographs, 
which form the exhibit American 
Prospects at the La Jolla Museum 
of Contemporary Art, he captures 
the twists and inconsistencies in 
what often appear. at first glance, 
to be unremarkable scenes from 
the life of America. 

which provide his pictures with a 
sense of irony are easily missed, 
placed in a corner or near the bot-
tom of his photographs, as if 
included unintentionally. Other 
times, it is the subject of the pho-
tograph which is out of place 
because it contrasts with the rest 
of the picture. 

One photograph, for example, 
is of a nearly lifeless Arizona 
landscape, with no sign of civiliza-
tion in the picture save for a single 
basketball hoop which rises out of 
the gravel. 

o T o 

One of Sternfeld's photographs 
is of Matanuska Glacier in Alaska. 
The view of the towering glacier is 
reproduced with all of its majesty, 
its natural beauty intruded on 
only by a white sign which proudly 
advertises " Majesti c View 
Estates ... 

Another photograph shows a 
firefighter calmly taking a pump-
kin from a small farmer's market 
while in the background a fire 
blazes through a large house. 

Joel Sternfeld was born in New 
York City in 19#. and graduated 
from Danmouth. He began pho-
tography shonly thereafter, and 
has worked only in color for the 
last twenty years. 

A firefighter plucks a pumpkin at a market while a fire bla~es a large house in the background. 
Almost without exception, 

Sternfeld's photo& are taken from 
a distance, capturing many details 
without seeming to emphasize any 
single object. Often those objects

Randee delegates 
the (right vibe' 

by laura knapp 
hiatw writer 

Tired of hearing about the pre-
sidential election? Tired of getting 
only image and no issues? Happy 
being an apathetic voter? Well , 
now there is an alternative. Ran-
dee of the Redwoods, MTV's 
hold-out hippy, is running for 
pr sident. 

So if you're tired of hearing 

about Mike from Massachusetts, 
and George "the bore" Bush, come 
to Mandeville on Oct. 16 and hear 
Randee of the Redwoods' refresh-
ing ideas on politics. 

His policies are a little sketchy 
( then agai n whose aren't?), but he 
does seem ro have college stu-
dents' issues at heart. If you're in 
Washington and you need a place 
to crash, no problem. Randee 

Randee of the Redwoods 

promises sleeping bags in the 
White House, and a buffalo in 
every city. 

Randee's presidential appoint-
ments could be interesting - he 
says, ''I'll delegate to anyone who 
has the right vibe." Who knows, 
if Randee becomes president, you 
could be the next Secretary of 
State. Look out Mikhail Gorba-
chev. 

His al\ important campaign slo-
gan? "Just Say Whoa." "Whoa 
can be taken many ways," he says. 
"It can be 'whoa' like 'stop' or 
'whoa' like 'hey, hey.' It's an all-

inclusive term. Also, it rhymes 
with 'No'." 

Randee admits to having no 
experience in government issues, 
but they aren't the hot topic of 
this election anyway. His govern-
ment style? "The King Solomon 
approach looks good to me." 

Randee of the Redwoods visited 
UCSD last year as Jim Turner of 
Duck's Breath Mystery Theater, 
so if you'Q like a good laugh and ' 
you're tired of political campaigns

Punch 
Continued from pale 1 

All of Seltzer'S previous di-
rectoral experience (besides the 
average 1986 movie Lucas) has 
been in television. He has done a 
lot of writing, and won a lot of 
awards, so it is rather surprising 
that he churned out such a bad 
script. He is not to blame for the 
limp gags though. The producers 
of Punchline hired about a million 
(or at least it seems that way) 
genuine stand-up comedians to 
write and co-star in the film. They 
also were responsible for coaching 
Field and Hanks (who didn't get 
his start in clubs, but as a classical 
Shakespearean actor) on their tim-
ing and delivery. For Hanks, who 
is a comic genius on his own, this 
wasn't hard. Sally Field, on the 
other hand, is not right for stand-
up. But as I said before, their jobs 
are similar to fine chefs dishing 
out the worst mess hall slop. 

If you can see through some of 
the funny jokes and some enjoya-
ble times that this movie offers 
with some intelligence and insight, 
you will see all the faults in this 
movie. If not, please remember 
some of the actors' and film mak-
ers' .finer moments, rather than 
this movie, because everyone of 
them has had better moments. 

Tom Hanks 

She is not helped along by both 
her and Tom Hanks' very poor 
acting performances. Hanks, as 
the u~and-coming hot comic 
Steven Gold, does have lOme good 
moments, but overall they are 
both pretty bad. But this movie is 
about stand-up comics, 50, you 
may ask, how is the comedy? To 
tell the truth, there are lOme really 
funny jokes, but to find the good 
jokes that are scattered through-
out the barrage of mediocre gags is 
a formidable task. 

But wait! I tead the press kit, 
and found out tbat this movie is 
not supposed to be about comedy 
or stand-up comics. It is (in the 
words of the writer / director David 
Seltzer) "about that secret feeling 
we all carry inside us that we can 
be more than we are, better than 
we are . .. " Seltzer, I think, realizes 
what a horrible script he wrote, 
and tries to bury his disaster In 
shovelfuls of average jokes. 

Lilah Krytsick is a housewife 
who has "always made people 
laugh," but when she tries to do it 
professionally, no one cares. 
Steven Gold is the brilliant (in 
their terms, not mine) comic who 
has the future in front of him. He 
helps her, she gets funny, at least 
the audience in the clubs thinks 
she's funny, the audience in the 
movie theater i. bored by her re-
hash of old Joan Rivers material, 
and then there is a big contest to 
see who can be on the Carson 
show. 

It is with the contest that the 
film has its nicest scenes. Not with 
the comedy, but with the owner of 
the club (played by.Marlc: Rydell) 
and with his rejection of an older 
comic.

with Eric Roth.) But Crystal has 
ome problems with serious dra~ 

matie acting. There are many heavy 
scenes in the film which seem to 
be a prerequisite for battling 
father~on movies such as scenes 
where the son yells at the father 
for never showing that he loved 
him and Crystal just seem phony 
at these times. He tries to make up 
for his lack of skill with a lot of 
volume, but it doesn't really do 
the trick. The fault may lie, how~ 
ever, with first~time film director 
Henry Winkler. 

Alan King, on the other hand, 
does an excellent job with both 
the jokes and the drama. He deftly 
portrays Abe as both annoying 

Lennon 
Continued from pale 1 
dredged up from the absolute bot~ 
tom of the Seatles' barrel. 

Lennon's own voice narrates 
the film. The producers decided 
that the "sound bites" from the 
film footage were sufficient to tell 
their story. Whether this tech~ 
nique imparts a feeling of intimacy 
or limits the scope of the movie is 
up to the viewer to decide. 

Lennon was born on October 
9 , 1940 in Liverpool, England. 
For a long time he played with the 
Beatles. In 1968 John met Yoko 
Ono, a Japanese performance artist 
and started bringing her to record~ 
ing sessions. 

and charming. Jobeth Williams, 
as Abbie's persistent girlfriend, is 
also fine in her role. 

There is a good deal of amusing 
banter between Abe and Abbie; 
the main problem with the film 
has to do with the dramatic asppcts 
rather than the comedy. 

First, again, Crystal has trouble 
with drama. But the problems run 
deeper than the acting; the whole 
storyline seems contrived and 
overly predictable at times. For 
example, I'm not giving anything 
away by saying that by the end of 
the film father and son are getting 
along much better than they were 
at the start; this much is obvious 
just from the previews. Also, all of 
Abbie's personal problems of 

The other three band members 
were none too keen on her and the 
band broke up. Lennon spent the 
next ten years recording what this 
writer considers albums of dub~ 
ious merit, with some time off for 
drinking and heavy drug use. In 
1980 he was murdered outside his 
New York apartment. 

A definite psychosis of the MTV 
mentality is that the daily lives of 
popular musicians are as impor~ 
tant as the music they create. 
Imagine is a product not only of 
that peculiar idea but also of the 
1970s hero~worship of rock stars. 
The "rare, never~before~seen " 
footage about which much bally~ 
hoo has been made is largely com~ 
prised of outtakes from what 
Lennon called " underground 
films" (read: home movies) and 

which we learn within the first 10 
minutes - he can't be serious, he ' 
can't show emotion, and so on 
-are neatly tied up one by one as 
the film progresses, just as you 
knew they would be. 

Besides the predictability, the 
film is so blatantly heartwarming 
and touching that it is almost 
annoying. Whenever an Impor~ 
tant Moment is occuring, loud 
swelling music underscores it to 
make sure you know this is the 
time to shed teats. 

Memories of Me has a lot of 
funny material in it, and as both 
Crystal and King are experienced 
comedians there are a lot of laughs. 
It may be worth seeing just for the 
comedy. However, it is not the 
type of movie that you would 
want to see twice, because then 
you would already know all of the 
jokes and you would have to pay 
attention to the story. 

scenes from what appears to be a 
never~released promotional film 
for the album Imagine (released in 
1971). 

What is shown of John'S per~ 
sonal life depicts him as cynical 
and very, very insecure. His, wife 
Yoko seems to have been more of 
a mother to him than partner. 
Like the rest of humanity, he was 
occasionally very clever and occa~ 
sionally very stubborn. Is this 
interesting? 

It all depends. The dedicated, 
hardcore fan will no doubt enjoy 
he movie no less for the intermi~ 

nable scenes of John and Yoko 
playing snuggle~bunnies in a var~ 
iety of situations. The cinema~ 
goer of more general interest may 
react on a somewhat lower level, 
and engage in appropriate behav~ 

Alan King plays Abe, the mooie extra father, to Billy Crystal's Abbie in 
Memories of Me. The film deals with changing a strained parent<hild 
relationship into a reunion of father and son. 

ior: leaving the theater, for 
example. 

Admittedly, the foregoing criti~ 
cism is a bit harsh. As a member of 
a generation that grew up consid~ 
ering the Beatles brilliant musi~ 
cians rather than cultural messi~ 
ahs, I can only judge the film on its 
cinematic merits and not on any 
dogmatic value it may have. A few 
great scenes are included: Lennon 
singing "Stand By Me" springs to 
mind. There is also a moment 
where John's insight and perspec~ 
tive are shown as he talks to a 
worshipful but befuddled young 
man who has some very strange 
views about Lennon's place in the 
universe. That John Lennon can 
appear so direct and forthright in 
such a situation gives us some hint 
of his true genius. 

Lennon was the greatest pop 
musician of the 19605 and sym~ 
bolized an entire time period and 
way of life, perhaps less willingly 
than he would have liked to. It is 
ironic, given his highly~publicized 
views on individualism and the 
standard of quality he maintained 
in his life and music, that such a 
film as Imagine has been produced 
with the consent of the Lennon 
estate. 

If it takes a movie to convince 
you that John was in fact a real 
human being, or if you are devoted 
enough to want to see the fifteen 
minutes of quality material in this 
two~hour film, go watch it. Oth~ 
erwise, put the White Album on 
your stereo and let the music 
express what no filmmaker can. 
Rest in peace, Mr. Lennon.
