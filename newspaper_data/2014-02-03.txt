The special election that was 
scheduled to take place Week 8 of 
Winter Quarter 2014 was canceled, 
and the referendums that were to be 
voted on during this election will now 
be voted on as a part of the regular 
general election Week 2 of Spring 
Quarter 2014.

Amendments to the transporta-
tion referendum language are the pri-
mary cause of this change. ASUCSD 
MOVES Executive Director Kyle 
Heiskala explained that campus 
administration would not pass the 
referendum language as it was written 
previously, stating it lacked specifics.

“The biggest roadblock that we ran 
into in the original development of 
the referendum was a Catch-22 where 
outside service providers weren’t able 

to give us any guarantees because the 
University couldn’t give us any guar-
antees for what would be provided,” 
Heiskala said. “It’s been a process to 
make sure we have the best proposal 
moving forward. It’s difficult to get 
more than 10 people from different 
interest groups and different depart-
ments on the same page at all times.”

However, due to this timeline set-
back, the language of the referendum 
has been strengthened to favor stu-
dents, including the possibility of low-
ering the referendum amount.

“We have made it way more effec-
tive and way more beneficial, poten-
tially, for students. If they were to 
vote on it they would have a lot more 
options to vote on because of the push 
back on the timeline,” Heiskala said. 
“Students will be paying less money 
for more services.”

Heiskala does not think that the 
change in the date of the vote will 

affect the voter turnout. He believes 
“students will want to weigh into this 
issue no matter when the election 
takes place.” 

However, A.S. President Andy 
Buselt noted the benefits of canceling 
the special election.

“Special elections are kind of cost-
ly,” Buselt said. “It will have to be 
pushed into the spring general elec-
tion ballot, which is good because it 
gets all the students engaging at once.”

All involved parties hope to finish 
writing the new transportation refer-
endum language within the next few 
weeks. Another referendum, original-
ly slated to be on the special election 
that will now appear on the general 
election ballot, is a nonbinding refer-
endum in support of a student graffiti 
and art space.

Faulconer 
Leads in 
Mayoral 
Race

A nonbinding referendum supporting a student 
graffiti art space on campus will appear on the general 
election ballot for Spring Quarter 2014. The referen-
dum comes in response to student objections over an 
administrative decision to paint over “Graffiti Hall” in 
Mandeville Center during Summer 2013. 

While the passing of this referendum would have 
no immediate consequences, the objective of the refer-
endum is to let the administration know that this is an 
issue still important to students. The hope is that the 
passing of the referendum can be used in negotiations 

with administration in regards to reinstating a graffiti 
art space.

The project has been spearheaded by A.S. President 
Andy Buselt, Assistant Vice Chancellor Gary Ratcliff 
and University Centers Director Sharon Van Bruggen.

Buselt hopes that at least “a structure or two where 
people are allowed just to go scribble on” will be in 
place by the end of the year. In the future, he hopes 
that this structure will expand into a community gar-
den, a place for practiced artists to create murals and a 
site for art workshops and other kinds of activities that 

The most recent U-T San 
Diego/10News poll shows 
Republican Kevin Faulconer leading 
in the race for San Diego’s mayoral 
position with 49 percent of the vote, 
while Democrat David Alvarez trails 
behind by 5 percent with 44 percent 
of the vote. The election will be held 
on Feb. 11, but mail-in ballots have 
been available to voters since Jan. 13. 

Although Alvarez has solidified 
his hold on middle-income voters, 
he lacks support from moderates 
and independent voters. According 
to SurveyUSA, these votes are vital 
to his success in garnering the posi-
tion of mayor.

“A Democrat rarely wins an 
election [...] without the support of 
moderates,” SurveyUSA told U-T 
San Diego on Jan. 26. “And today, 
Alvarez trails by 12 [percent] there.”

According to the poll, Faulconer 
has the majority of voters north 
of Interstate 8, which includes the 
districts of La Jolla, Mira Mesa and 
Carmel Valley. He carries a 27-point 
lead against Alvarez in that region. 
However, Alvarez claims the sup-
port of voters south of I-8, which 
includes the districts of North Park, 
Encanto and Barrio Logan, giving 
him a 20-point lead in that region.

Mayoral debates that have been 
taking place since Jan. 15 have 
allowed both candidates to express 
their views on key issues. The civic 
issues covered in these debates 
include pension overhaul, afford-
able housing fees and minimum and 
prevailing wages. 

Pro-labor Alvarez has voiced 
his support for raising minimum 
wage as a way of strengthening San 
Diego’s middle class. He is also ral-
lying to impose fees on commercial 
development for affordable housing 
and the community plan update for 
Barrio Logan, which would enforce 
a five-block buffer zone between 
residents and the shipyard industry 
nearby.

Alvarez has served on the San 
Diego City Council since 2010, 
prioritizing equality of services 
throughout San Diego.

“The inequities that exist in the 
city have been pervasive for the last 
several decades,” Alvarez said in an 
interview with the Guardian. “As a 
native San Diegan, I want to make 
sure that no matter where you live, 
no matter where you come from, 
you have opportunities to have a 
good life. That’s my vision for the 
city.”

Faulconer is pro-business and 
supports the idea of placing city 
services up for competitive bid with 
the private sector, ideas that won 
him the support of the San Diego

An anonymous donor recently 
gave $275 million to the Sanford-
Burnham Medical Research 
Institute, a nonprofit research 
center based in La Jolla. The gift 
breaks all previous records for 
private donations to San Diego 
County organizations.

“This exceptional generos-
ity sets our vision in motion, and 
cements the stature of Sanford-
Burnham as a global leader in 
translational biomedical research,” 
Chairman of the Sanford-
Burnham Board of Trustees 
Gregory T. Lucier said in a Jan. 28 
U-T San Diego article.  

The institute’s primary focus 
has been cancer research and pre-
vention since its founding in 1976. 
It now performs critical work in a 

wide spectrum of fields, including 
infectious diseases, drug discov-
ery, stem cells and nanotechnol-
ogy. It offers postdoctoral training 
for scientists as well. The institute 
routinely works with other orga-
nizations both in San Diego and 
around the country and is also 
highly ranked worldwide for its 
groundbreaking discoveries and 
publications. 

According to Sanford-
Burnham’s website, the organiza-
tion is “dedicated to discovering 
the fundamental molecular causes 
of disease and devising the inno-
vative therapies of tomorrow.”

The institute announced that 
the gift will be spent over the 
next decade as part of a larger 
effort to raise $500 million in all 
of Sanford-Burnham’s campuses. 
The record donation coincided 
with the Board of Trustee’s new, 

10-year strategy to further accel-
erate the institute’s understanding 
of how diseases operate and inno-
vative therapies to combat them.

“Our ultimate goal is to trans-
late basic research discoveries into 
innovative therapeutics that have a 
tangible impact on people’s lives,” 
Dr.. Kristiina Vuori, president of 
Sanford-Burnham, said to U-T 
San Diego. “Our strategic vision 
will enable us to speed cures to 
patients through an expanded net-
work of partnerships with organi-
zations that share our mission to 
conquer disease.”

As a nonprofit medical center, 
Sanford-Burnham relies on grants 
and private donations to fund its 
work, with an annual budget of 
approximately $153 million.

Regional Chamber of Commerce.
He believes that San Diego’s wel-

fare relies on the backbone of small 
businesses and has shown support 
for the recent overhaul of San Diego’s 
pension system which lowered annu-
al payments made to workers’ pen-
sion plans. 

“We’re continuing the reform so 
we have dollars to put back into our 
neighborhoods,” Faulconer said to 
CBS 8 San Diego News. “To pave our 
streets, to keep our libraries and [rec-
reational] centers open on nights and 
weekends. To put more cops on the 
beat, that’s what I’m going to bring as 
mayor and I can’t wait to get started.”

Although both candidates favor 

the convention center expansion, 
they strongly disagree on how the 
project is going to be financed. The 
current plan for this venture will 
come from hotel room taxes that will 
be highest for hotels closest to the 
convention center.

were lost with the craft center.
“The bare minimum that I would 

like to see is just a place for expres-
sion,” Buselt said. “Murals would be 
incredible — we need more art on 
our campus — but at the very least 
we need a space that will provide free 
speech for our community.”

While Ratcliff believes that this 
will create an outlet for artistic stu-
dents, he is not confident that it will 
satisfy students who were most upset 
by the removal of Graffiti Hall.

“Graffiti Hall wasn’t a program 
administered by the university, so 
there was kind of this underground 
element to it that might have had a 
certain appeal that you can’t replicate 
in a program that is officially run 
by the A.S. or the Student Center,” 
Ratcliff said. “We’re going to still 

have a lot of the same concerns about 
this that we did with Graffiti Hall.” 

Some of those concerns include 
deciding whether or not this will 
be a space for 24/7 student access, 
ensuring that the space and is safe 
and illuminated if it is to be made 
accessible at night and guaranteeing 
that the graffiti “doesn’t migrate to 
surfaces that we don’t want to have 
painted.”

The most likely proposed loca-
tion is the Hump behind the Old 
Student Center or an area nearby.

Part of the inspiration from the 
project comes from a graffiti park 
in San Diego, Writerz Blok, where 
plywood surfaces are covered with 
graffiti and are circulated out with 
new plywood surfaces once the 
paint becomes too thick. University 
Centers is not sure what type of 
material would be used to create the 

structures but is considering ply-
wood as well as cellophane, a vege-
table-based, decomposable material.

In the meantime, an event on Feb. 
16 will allow students to practice 
graffiti art on an impermanent struc-
ture made of cellophane wraps. It 
will be placed at the Student Center 
but will be portable enough to be 
potentially moved to Library Walk.

“They’re going to purchase a 
small inventory of graffiti paint and 
are working with Writerz Block to 
identify expert graffiti artists that 
might do some demonstrations and 
then have sections of cellophane 
where students can do their own 
work,” Ratcliff said. 

The general election will take 
place Week 2 of Spring Quarter 2014.

QUICK  TAKES ACCORDING TO THE FOUNDATION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IN EDUCATION (FIRE), UNIVERSITY POLICIES THAT REGULATE FREE SPEECH ARE UNLAWFUL AND SHOULD BE ERADICATED FOR THE SAKE OF STUDENT EXPRESSION.

Super Bowl 
Ad Spots 
Will Buy 
Your Heart

Kelvi n  N oron ha  
knoronha@ucsd.edu

Thinking Caps

With Super Bowl Sunday comes the continuous barrage of TV ads. Some 
are bizarrely funny (Volkswagen), 
some exploit their cuteness factor 
(Budweiser’s touching puppy-and-
Clydesdale companionship story), 
and others advertise boring local 
water softener companies. And 
try as we may to resist, these often 
ridiculous ads still drag us to the 
stores to buy whichever product 
they’re hawking.

When watching the variety of ads 
flashing after every first down, I usu-
ally try to dismiss the extent to which 
ads affect me, but the sad truth is that 
they work without me even realizing 
it. Once I’m in the supermarket aisle 
looking for soap, I’m probably going 
to pick Tide rather than a random 
Super Kleen 3000, solely on the basis 
of brand recognition and the fact that 
its goofy Joe Montana-themed ad 
imprinted its name into my brain.

Of course, all of New York’s 
advertising firms know this, and, 
more importantly, they know how to 
manipulate it. Consequently, they feel 
that it’s worth it to drop $4 million 
on 60 seconds worth of broadcasting 
time. As if that wasn’t enough, they 
take to Youtube en masse in the days 
leading up to the game to place teaser 
trailers for their Super Bowl ads. If 
we think “soda,” we’ll probably think 
of Coke and Pepsi, which show up at 
regular intervals trying to outdo each 
other. They may seem desperate, but 
in the process, they indelibly etch 
themselves into our consciousness 
such that we’ll never dream of buying 
Safeway cola.

Ad making is not all easy, though. 
Advertisers need to carefully select 
the particular image they want associ-
ated with their company. Hilarious 
ads are all very well, but if there’s no 
relation whatsoever to the product’s 
selling point, it’s not very useful. 
Brands like Budweiser and Chrysler 
use varied shades of Americana to 
pull at our heartstrings and stir up 
patriotic feelings — especially appro-
priate for a crowd of football fans 
who may start to second guess their 
imported Coronas and Nissans.

There’s also a fair amount of 
risk involved with trying to appeal 
to emotionally volatile fans. The 
Washington Post’s Paul Farhi writes 
that the outcome of the game and 
its influence on people’s mood can 
render even the most creative ad spot 
unsuccessful. If the game is close and 
heated, people are fixed on their TV 
and raptly absorbing everything they 
see, including the commercials. But 
if the game is a blowout, viewers will 
get bored and/or rage and scowl the 
entire way through — not the senti-
ment that a company wants associ-
ated with its service. As a result of 
this social psychoanalysis, advertisers 
usually place their high-profile com-
mercials in the first half, when the 
game is exciting and people await the 
halftime show.

Luckily, this can be used to your 
advantage for Super Bowl XLIX. If 
you’re the kind of watcher who can’t 
quite tell the difference between a 
quarterback and a receiver and would 
much rather watch the best quirky 
commercials, you can just leave 
before the end of the second quarter. 
If no one on the Billboard top-10 is 
performing, you won’t really be miss-
ing much.

Unregulated free speech may 
have costly consequences in certain 
settings. In fact, the words people 
say often come at the expense of 
the dignity, safety or emotional well 
being of others. The Foundation for 
Individual Rights in Education has 
recently accused several universities 
of setting rules that restrict students’ 
freedom of speech, but they are 
missing the point of these regula-
tions. The aim of these universities is 
not to attack the First Amendment, 
but to protect students’ well being 
while promoting a safe, desirable 
learning environment.

Though First Amendment 
controversies are nothing new, the 
recent expulsion of an Arizona State 
University fraternity after hosting a 
blatantly racist Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day party has added extra fuel to the 
flame for individual rights activists 
groups. This includes FIRE, which 
dubbed ASU’s expulsion of this fra-
ternity a breach in the students’ rights 
to freedom of expression. However, 
the university was more than justified 
in employing firm disciplinary mea-
sures; these clearly communicate that 
any racist behavior targeting specific 
demographics is unacceptable.

Many people are under the 
impression that the First Amendment 
allows anyone, anywhere to say any-
thing, when in reality, it only guar-
antees that the government cannot 
pass “laws” abridging the right to free 
speech. This right to free expression 
should be viewed as just a single 
pillar of our constitution’s underly-
ing objectives. The preamble clearly 
designates the insurance of domestic 
tranquility as a principal ground for 
the entire document; one person’s 
freedom of speech should not super-
sede another’s constitutional right to 
this “tranquility.”

Universities implement codes of 
conduct to protect students’ rights, 
promote ethical standards and cre-
ate an open educational environ-
ment. Enrolling in a university 
should be seen as a contractual 
agreement to follow school codes in 
return for a quality education and 
a holistically enriching experience. 
Without these regulations, students 
may be exposed to forms of dis-
crimination with the potential to 
leave lasting repercussions.

Restricting Free Speech at Universities Violates 
.QZ[\�)UUMVLUMV\�:QOP\[�IVL�;\QÆM�;\]LMV\�-`XZM[[QWV

Censorship on Derogatory Speech Prevents Offensive  
*MPI^QWZ�IVL�8ZWUW\M[�I�:M[XMK\N]T�4MIZVQVO�-V^QZWVUMV\

Freedom of speech is not only 
a student right, but a human right, 
and universities who seek to limit 
this expression pose an infringe-
ment on civil liberties. According to 
the Foundation for Individual Rights 
in Education, 59 percent of higher 
education institutions place restric-
tions on free speech, while 35.6 
percent overregulate it. In a modern 
and diverse society, such statistics 
are unacceptable.

Universities should foster a 
diverse “marketplace of ideas,” and 
it is unethical to evade every issue 
that triggers sensitivities or stirs 
controversial debate. According 
to FIRE, the only exception to 
unregulated free speech is “behav-
ior so serious that it would interfere 
with a reasonable person’s ability 
to receive his or her education.” 
Censorship in an institutional 
context not only breaches personal 
freedoms, but is likely to produce 
individuals who are ill prepared for 
the unsheltered dialogues and bold 
personalities that, in the real world, 
are virtually inevitable. 

College is the place for students 
to discover their individuality, to 
seek out who they are and what they 

believe in. However, true self-dis-
covery can only be achieved through 
experimentation, and this experi-
mentation is impossible without 
exposure to different perspectives. 
FIRE advocates for unregulated 
speech, saying it is a “fundamental 
American freedom, and nowhere 
should it be more valued and pro-
tected than at America’s colleges 
and universities.” If students are 
sheltered from any ideas outside of 
what school policy deems appropri-
ate, their visions will likely become 
mainstream and their understanding 
of the world one-dimensional. 

Curriculum may generate intel-
ligence, but it cannot shape the 
values, foster the originality or 
build the character that will permit 
students to make a larger impact 
on society. Moreover, ideas of what 
is conventional, provocative or 
appropriate differ greatly from one 
individual to the next, and therefore 
it is unfeasible to promote an edu-
cational setting where the clash of 
different views is resolved through 
unlawful censorship.

The idea of free tuition at public universities is infi-nitely alluring, especially in a tough economy. On Jan. 3, Jordan Weissmann, a writer at The Atlantic, 
wrote a follow up article to a piece he had written about a 
year ago proposing a radical change to the federal finan-
cial aid system for colleges. Weissmann suggests that the 
current amount of money being spent on non-loan finan-
cial aid could instead be redistributed and used to drasti-
cally lower tuition across the country at public colleges. 
According to Weissmann, it would only have cost the 
government an additional $62.6 billion to implement his 
proposal in 2013. However, this plan is unfeasible when it 
comes to making it law and actually putting it into action. 

Currently, the tuition system at most public schools 
works as follows: the well-off students pay higher fees to 
free up larger sums of money to aid the poorer students. 
His proposal would keep the situation essentially the 
same, but make costs for low-income students close to 
nothing, and bring tuition down radically to a couple of 
thousand dollars for richer students. As an idea, virtually 
free tuition sounds great, but the implementation would 
create larger concerns. 

Private colleges will face serious repercussions if all 
their federal aid is cut off, as suggested by Weissmann. He 
even admits that “The biggest loser would be students at 
private colleges...with non-loan aid to their students cut 
off, [colleges] would also be forced to reconsider their 

pricing.” Basically, lowering public school tuition would 
force private schools to lower theirs in order to com-
pete. This would be a positive for students and families, 
considering how high the current costs are for attending 
elite private universities, but it is naive to think that these 
institutions will accept the changes just like that. They 
would lobby against the legislation, further causing rising 
costs. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, 
schools like Boston University and Johns Hopkins 
University spent approximately $3.5 million in 2008 lob-
bying against parts of a federal bill that governs higher 
education. 

Additionally, private institutions rely heavily on rev-
enue from tuition in order to stay afloat, unlike public 
schools, who receive a good amount of their funding 
from the state and federal government. The University of 
California system, for example, says on its website that it 
receives about 50 percent of its core funding (which does 
not include money devoted to research) from the state. 
If federal funds to private colleges were completely cut 
off, and they were forced to lower tuition, it is likely that 
some of these schools would no longer be able to afford 
to remain open.

Furthermore, Weissmann fails to consider the inevi-
table bureaucratic challenges that this idea would face, 
and the added costs and side effects that would come 
with such a journey. For example, in his first article, he 

The Price Is Wrong
Radical proposal to lower public university tuition costs lacks 
proper planning and risks bankrupting private institutions.

LETTERS  TO  THE  EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Six days after its membership 

voted in December to implement 
an academic boycott against Israeli 
universities, the American Studies 
Association hurriedly issued a defen-
sive appeal for support bemoaning 
in the wake of a tsunami of backlash 
and censure against the boycott, what 
it defined as a “campaign of intimida-
tion against the ASA.”

Instead of taking responsibility 
for the significant and profoundly 
damaging action it collectively took 
by approving the boycott in the first 
place, the ASA saw the wide-ranging 
negative response from the academic 
community to their action not as 
justifiable criticism of an intellectu-
ally defective boycott but as an attack 
on the organization’s integrity, its 
stated solidarity with the Palestinians 
and its overall credibility as an aca-
demic organization. 

The paranoid notion that “power-
ful and well funded” interests had 
any desire to even notice, let alone 
seek to destroy, the ASA, is ridicu-
lous. More troubling is that this 
statement reveals that ASA members 
naively believed that they could 
institute a broad academic boycott 
against Israel, call for Jewish academ-
ics to be shunned from the commu-
nity of world scholars while simul-
taneously singling out and attacking 
the Jewish state as an illegal, colonial 
occupier on stolen Palestinian land 
and tar the reputation of Israeli 
scholars by making them complicit 
in and responsible for the actions 
of their government in perpetrating 
what the ASA defines as an “illegal 
occupation” without anyone with 
opposing views answering back these 
slanders with counterarguments and 
opposing views.

The ASA claimed that the wide 
condemnation came after the boy-
cott vote, not because the boycott’s 
concept was intellectually defective 
and ran counter to academia’s values 
but “because it dared to express criti-
cism of Israel.”  

More significant is that, in sin-
gling out Israel and Jewish academics 
to be boycotted, many, including 
former Harvard president Lawrence 
Summers, observed that the ASA 
boycott was possibly anti-Semitic “if 
not in intent, then in effect.” “These 
organizations falsely accuse the ASA 
membership of being anti-semitic 
[sic],” the ASA message said, “bent 
on the destruction of Israel.”

Protestations and defenses aside, 
the issue is far more obvious than 
the members of ASA care to realize 
and much less insidious. Academic 
freedom grants the professors the 
right to spew forth any academic 
meanderings they wish, but it clear-
ly does not make them free from 
being challenged for their thoughts.

The core issue is that just as the 
pro-Palestinian activists within the 
ASA have the right under the umbrel-
la of academic free speech to express 
their views — no matter how factually 
inaccurate, vitriolic or repellant they 
may be. Those within and outside aca-
demia with opposing views also have 
the right, under the same precepts of 
free expression, to question the ASA’s 
views and to call them anti-Semitic or 
racist or genocidal.

That the academics of the ASA 
do not understand or choose to 
ignore such a fundamental concept 
is troubling and yet more evidence 
that universities have become, as 
Abigail Thernstrom has described 
them, “islands of repression in a sea 
of freedom.”

proposes that “the federal govern-
ment could send the cash down to 
the states, on the condition that local 
legislatures kept per student funding 
at a certain level, and colleges lowered 
their tuition rates…” as opposed to 
the current method of giving money 
directly to students and their parents.

Although this idea sounds fantas-
tic in theory, in practice it would be 
highly inefficient. Creating a pathway 
down to states from a federal level 
financially would involve creating new 
legislation in every state and forming 
new governing bodies to handle the 
distribution of the money, or giving 
more responsibility to pre-existing 
organizations. Weissmann’s estimate 

does not consider the costs for the 
plan’s affiliated tasks, and only takes 
into account the funds necessary to 
cover tuition.

A prime example of this is the 
current healthcare bill. The goal of 
achieving universal healthcare is 
laudable, yet the federal government 
failed to properly try to mitigate the 
consequences to employers and health 
care providers across the country. 
According to NBC, the bill has had 
all sorts of economic ramifications, 
including thousands of people losing 
their jobs or having their hours cut 
because of mandates like a 30-hour 
threshold for part-time workers 
to receive health insurance. While 
Weissmann argues with regard to 
healthcare that “Americans have an 

allergy to straightforward policy solu-
tions involving the public sector,” the 
current situation is a prime example 
of what happens when legislation is 
put into effect without being properly 
planned out. 

A proposal to reduce the cost of 
public school tuition is something 
the government should explore, but 
Weissman’s plan is overly idealistic 
and doesn’t delve enough into the 
negative consequences of such actions. 
This goal should remain on the hori-
zons of lawmakers and universities, as 
something that could be a possibility 
with the right amounts of research, 
planning, and viable goals.

Universities is Anti-Semitic

TOUCHED
by an

I  t isn’t widely known that Victoria’s Secret model Lindsay Ellingson was once a fellow Triton. Her brief career at UCSD in pursuit of an undergraduate biology degree took an unexpected turn when she was scouted 
on the street in 2004, leading her to snag a highly 
coveted spot as a Victoria’s Secret Angel several 
years later.

But before her modeling debut for Christian 
Dior, it wasn’t uncommon to spot the self-pro-
claimed math and science nerd, who was study-
ing to become a doctor, hitting the books by the 
beaches in La Jolla.

“When I was in college at UCSD, I would liter-
ally walk five minutes to these cliffs that overlook 
Black’s Beach, and that is where I would study and 
read,” Ellingson said in an interview with Miss A, 

a charity and style blog.
Ellingson wasn’t just a member of UCSD’s 

biology department — she was also an active 
member of the UCSD Dance Team. But her time 
at UCSD was cut short at the age of 21, when she 
was discovered by ProScout, an American talent 
and model-scouting corporation. She was quickly 
whisked away to Paris to open for Dior’s Spring/
Summer 2005 collection and since then, Ellingson 
has walked the runway for numerous big-name 
fashion houses, including Chanel, John Galliano 
and Balenciaga. She has also graced the covers of 
multiple fashion magazines, such as Italian Elle 
and British GQ.  

But the San Diego-born model says that work-

DONOR  STUDY:

“The best part of teaching stu-
dents is easily when you’ve got 
the students hooked,” Interaxon 
Publicist Lior Schenk, a Sixth 
College junior, said. “When you say 
something that’s just mind blowing 
to them, and you see their eyes light 
up, and then they can’t stop asking 
questions — that’s how you know 
they’re learning.”

Engaging students is exactly 
what Interaxon, a neuroscience-
focused student organization, aims 
to do. Interaxon reaches out to 
underserved K–12 schools through-
out the San Diego area to teach 
students about the brain through 
interactive presentations a few times 
each quarter.

Though Interaxon was founded 
at UCLA in 2006, a chapter of the 
organization was later opened at 
UCSD in Fall 2009.

 Today, Feb. 3, UCSD’s chapter 
will be visiting El Cajon’s Grossmont 
High School to present to a class of 
medical biology students. 

The organization hopes to 
expand its membership and plans to 
hold a building workshop in which 
members can work on their presen-
tations for future visits.

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
senior Cindy Lam, the president of 
Interaxon at UCSD, said that a focus 
on underprivileged communities is 
key to the group.

“[We] target those areas where 
[underserved schools are] less likely 
to have better funded science pro-
grams or more specialized studies, 
like neuroscience, [to show] them 
that science can be cool; the brain is 
exciting and neuroscience is some-

thing that can be relevant and inter-
esting,” Lam said.

Interaxon uses yearly California 
standardized test results, such as 
the California Standardized Testing 
and Reporting (STAR) program, to 
determine which schools in the San 
Diego County would benefit the 
most from interactive lessons in 
neuroscience. 

More specifically, the group 
reaches out to schools in which over 
50 percent of the students tested 
perform at the “basic” level or below 
on these tests.

The presentations usually take 
a total of 15 minutes. Typically, 
the students are split up into three 
groups for 10-minute rotations to 
maximize each individual’s learn-
ing. Then, at the end, the students 
participate in an activity that puts 
their newfound knowledge to work.  
One example of Interaxon’s activi-
ties is a neuroscientific look at how 
humans react when listening to 
music. 

“Music and the brain is not a 
commonly presented project, 
[because] you don’t think that 
music can intersect with neurosci-
ence, and that’s something that can 
really catch the attention of kids,” 
Lam said. “[For example,] Lior 
played his violin at one of the visits, 
and then they would [...] examine 
some aspects of music and why they 
sound “good” versus “bad” and how 
that is happening in your brain. 
[We] work really hard to make it 
engaging and be more than just a 
passive presentation but be some-
thing that really has the students 
interacting with us.”

ing for Victoria’s Secret was a dream of 
hers since she began modeling.

“I started modeling seven years 
ago, and I immediately wanted to do 
the VS fashion show, so I tried out 
three years in a row,” Ellingson said 
in an interview with The Formula, a 
beauty and lifestyle blog. “The first 
two times, I didn’t get it, but the third 
time, I got the show.”

Ellingson has since walked for 
Victoria’s Secret for five consecutive 
years, sporting a 3D-printed snow-
flake ensemble in the most recent 
show in 2013. However, it was only 
three years ago that she was officially 
signed as one of the lingerie brand’s 
signature Angels.

Ellingson’s success is an inspiration 
for many students and aspiring mod-
els on campus.

“She’s a perfect example that 
models can be beauty and brains,” 
Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Katherine Selina, a cover model for 
the Spring/Summer 2013 issue of 
UCSD’s Trend Magazine, said. “She 
came to UCSD, so obviously, she’s 
really smart. She put her motivation 
into other things. She’s a realistic 
example of someone who’s made it 
big in the modeling world, which is 
such a huge inspiration.”

Of course, behind the glamour 
and the admiration, modeling isn’t 
as easy as many may think, especially 
for full-time students juggling school-
work and photo shoots on the side. 
Regardless, many student models find 
that the joys of modeling outweigh the 
added stress.

“It’s all very exhilarating,” Muir 
College transfer student Jordan 
Garcia, a cover model of Trend’s Fall 
2013 issue, said. “It’s fun to be pseudo-
famous and at the same time, hav-
ing a schedule and going to classes. 
Modeling is an addition to my sched-
ule, but if you really love something, 
you’ll make time for it.”

For Eleanor Roosevelt College 

junior Blia Thao, balancing school-
work, her job as Trend’s Stylist 
Director and separate modeling gigs 
means navigating a sink-or-swim situ-
ation that demands good time man-
agement and prioritizing.

“Time management is very impor-
tant, and the main thing is to stay 
focused,” Thao said. “In order for me 
to do everything well, I make sure 
each hour is not a waste of time. You 
need to figure out what’s most impor-
tant to you and how to prioritize that.”

For many models like Garcia, suc-
cessful modeling is more than a mat-
ter of making time for the craft or 
even having the “right look.” Garcia 
believes that the profession stems 
beyond exhibiting a fit physique or 
attractive features. He described mod-
eling as an art that requires patience 
and skill and at the crux of it all, con-
fidence. Ellingson seems to share the 
same view.

“I think women in all shapes and 
sizes are beautiful,” Ellingson said in 
an interview with Vancouver’s The 
Georgia Straight. “You don’t have to 
look like a model to be beautiful and 
sexy [...] I have sisters, and they have 
completely different body types than 
me, and they’re super confident, and I 

think they’re super beautiful and sexy. 
So you just have to own it.”

Selina agrees with this point. She 
believes that the key to confidence is 
believing in yourself.

“You can be the most beautiful 
girl in the world, but if you go around 
moping and saying, ‘I’m ugly,’ then 
people are going to believe that you 
are ugly,” Selina said. “It’s all about 
what you think about yourself.”

Ellingson’s story of success in the 
modeling industry is a testament that 
students, armed with a healthy dose of 
self-confidence and passion, shouldn’t 
hesitate to venture outside their con-
centrations of study. 

“This is a really good message 
for students at UCSD, a science and 
engineering-based school,” Thao said. 
“By sharing [Ellingson’s] story to the 
rest of the student population, it’s a 
great way of showing people that even 
though we are here studying, there is 
a possibility to break out of the mold 
to pursue something that you’re very, 
very passionate about, like acting, 
dancing or modeling.”

regardless of major, grade level or 
previous experience in science. 
The group has reached out to vari-
ous departments at UCSD, such as 
education, psychology and human 
development. 

“The reason why we’re open 
to anybody regardless of their sci-
ence background is [that] we’ll have 
workshops where we train the mem-
bers in the topic they’re presenting, 
and we’ll run through it with them 
to make sure they actually under-
stand and are comfortable with the 
material,” Lam said.

Lam explained that the special 
focus on neuroscience stems from 
a general lack of education on the 

subject up until AP Biology, which 
some schools don’t offer. 

Although the group visits dif-
ferent schools to educate younger 
children about the brain specifically, 
Lam acknowledges that the larger 
goal is to get students, especially 
those from underserved commu-
nities, excited about science and 
college.

“It’s not just the topic of neuro-
science but also the fact that we go 
there as UCSD students to put an 
image of, ‘You can become this. You 
can become a college student study-
ing neuroscience and doing all these 
cool things,’” Lam said.

UCSD won points by using fast com-
bination attacks, but UCLA dominated 
the net in the long rallies and won the 
set 25–19.

UCLA continued to dominate in 
the second set, leading 15–12 midway 
into the set. The Bruins never let up, 
hitting .500 to UCSD’s .269 as they 
cruised to a 25–18 win. 

Similar to the first two sets, UCLA 
pulled away midway through the third 
when the Bruins led just 14–16 to win 
the match 25–20.

“I think we play better,” redshirt 
freshman middle blocker Ganesh Elie 
said after the match. “In the beginning 
of the season we weren’t really con-
nected very well after we lost a couple 
of key players. But I think we started 
to play better even though we lost to 
them tonight.”

Friday night UCSD went into its 
seventh road contest in nine matches 
against UC Irvine, two-time defending 
national champion. UC Irvine started 
strong, hammering home an unheard-
of three straight service aces. Taking 
the 5–1 lead, UCSD never threatened 
the Anteaters and lost the opening set 

25–11. A tighter second game saw 12 
lead changes with a Triton. The teams 
knotted at last at 18–18, but UC Irvine 
took seven of the nine following points 
to win the set. 

By the third set, disheartened, 
UCSD went under 10–0 to start, ulti-
mately losing the match 25–12.

“Irvine came out with a really good 
start and served well,” Ring said. “We 
struggled to pass and that affected 
our offence, so we didn’t hit that well 
tonight. Our energy was lower than 
last night [against UCLA]. We had our 
opportunities at 18–18 in set two but 
lost. So now we’re looking at finishing 
and winning our games”.

Senior captains setter Mike 
Brunsting and outside hitter Nick 
Iorfino led the UCSD attack with a col-
lective 14 kills. Freshman libero Griffin 
Galvin collected a career-high five digs, 
while freshman middle blocker Shayne 
Beamer and outside hitter Ian Colbert 
made their college debut.

in,” VanDerveer said. “I think when 
that happens, it really puts a lot of 
pressure on the defense.”

Junior guard Stephanie Yano led 
UCSD with 11 points, as the Tritons 
played without leading scorer Seto 
who was out for the night due to 
injury.  

Despite the loss, senior forward 
Erin Dautremont’s 10-point contribu-
tion put her above the 1,000-career-

point mark. Dautremont, now with 
1,009 career points, became the ninth 
Triton to achieve such a feat, joining 
the ranks of former teammates Daisy 
Feder and Emily Osga, as well as 
2012 graduate and current assistant 
coach Chelsea Carlisle. 

After this weekend, the Tritons 
have dropped to sixth in the CCAA 
standings after being tied for sec-
ond only two weeks ago. UCSD will 
now head back on the road, traveling 
to play CCAA foes Chico State on 

Friday, Feb. 7 and Cal State Stanislaus 
on Feb. 8, both of which will tip off 
at 5:30 p.m.

“I think our scouting will be 
important this week, [along with] 
our game prep,” VanDerveer said. 
“Hopefully, [we’ll] find a little bit of 
offensive rhythm. We have played 
well on the road, so hopefully that 
will carry over to this weekend.”

asked about McCann’s milestone. 
“He’s just a really good representa-

he’s capable of.”

Behind McCann’s well-rounded 
performance, the Tritons were final-
ly able to distance themselves from 

the Lumberjacks by going on a 13–0 
run in the second half. Sophomore 
forward Drew Dyer recorded an 
impressive 17 points on 4-for-

dual stages with leg rest. It was lightly 
used. Padding still great, leather is in super 
condition (no tears at all). I just polished all 
of the wood and treated the leather... and 
it cleaned up beautifully, making it even 
harder for me to sell! It’s solid, sturdy, eas-
ily considered in “good” condition. Recliner 
function/mechanics are as precise and solid 
as the day I bought it. Kids or large adults 
alike can be comfortable and balanced in it 
regarding the reclining feature. Hate to part 
with it, but I know it’ll be a great addition 
for somebody’s home. It is slightly large, 
and can supply measurements on demand. 
However, it’s not too heavy. Listing ID:

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Tritons Split Weekend Games
UCSD fell to Cal Poly Pomona before taking down Humboldt State.

BY  Daniel sung       staff  writer

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL VOLLEYBALL

Basketball Suffers Back-to-Back Losses  
UCSD Basketball falls four spots to sixth place in the CCAA after weekend defeats.

The UCSD men’s basketball team split its weekend series at RIMAC, falling to No. 23 Cal Poly Pomona 69–57 on Friday before defeating Humboldt State 75–61. 
The Tritons end the week with a 6–8 conference record to 
land in seventh place in the California Collegiate Athletics 
Association, just one spot behind San Francisco State for the 
final CCAA tournament bid.

Cal Poly Pomona — currently on a 13-game winning streak 
— disrupted the Triton offense throughout the first half, forc-
ing UCSD to shoot a meager 13 percent from the field and 
1-for-10 from three-point territory. 

Cal Poly started the game off with a 9–0 run and stretched 
out the lead to 21 by halftime. 

“They’re one of the better-scoring, defensive teams in the 
country so they obviously deserve some credit for the way we 
shot the ball,” UCSD head coach Eric Olen said. “But we also 
had some good looks that we feel like we normally make and 
those didn’t go in.”

Although down 34–15, the Tritons were able to cut the lead 
down to 10 points with only a minute remaining in the second 
half. By aggressively attacking the basket, the Tritons made 64 
percent of their attempts; however, they eventually failed to 
make a full comeback.

“In the second half we were more aggressive,” Olen said. 
“Obviously we got the ball in the basket and that helped us. 
We were able to attack the basket, stuff around the rim, we got 
to the free throw line.”

Senior guard James McCann scored a game-high 21 points 
and also dished out three assists. Freshman guard Adam Klie 
and redshirt freshman guard Aleks Lipovic added 10 and 12 
points, respectively.

UCSD bounced back the following night to defeat 
Humboldt State. Both teams shot above 40 percent in the 
first half; however, the Tritons had a slight, five-point lead at 
intermission. 

McCann, again, had a terrific performance, scoring 17 
points on top of eight assists. McCann now holds the UCSD 
all-time assist career record in the Division II era with 421 
assists, passing former player and UCSD coach Clint Allard.

“[McCann’s] been huge and tonight was a really good 

See MEN’S BASKETBALL, page 9

The UCSD women’s basketball 
team had a disappointing weekend at 
home, suffering two losses in as many 
games against Cal Poly Pomona and 
Humboldt State by scores of 73–67 
and 63–50 respectively. The Tritons 
now hold an 11–7 overall record and 
are 8–6 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. 

On Friday, Jan. 31 in a tight 
game against Cal Poly Pomona, the 
Tritons remained close throughout 
but ultimately failed to secure the 
win against the first-ranked team in 
the CCAA.

“I think our offense got a little 
stagnant against their zone,” UCSD 
head coach Heidi VanDerveer said. 
“A lot of the problems actually came 
defensively.”

In the first half, the Tritons strug-
gled to pressure the Broncos who 
shot an impressive 59 percent (13–
22) from the field and went 6-for-9 
from beyond the arc. The Tritons 
kept themselves in contention with 
their three-point shooting, sinking 
seven of 13 three-pointers but only 
hitting a dismal three buckets from 
within the paint.

Four of UCSD’s seven first-half 
three-pointers came courtesy of 
junior guard Miranda Seto, who 
scored 11 of UCSD’s initial 13 points. 
Seto would finish the game with a 
career-high 25 points (7–12 from the 
field), along with six rebounds and 

four assists.
“I think [Miranda] has just been 

one of our most consistent play-
ers and been aggressive all year,” 
VanDerveer said. “I think she has a 
lot of confidence.”

After trailing by as much as 13 
points in the second half, the Tritons 
slowly climbed their way back into 
the game, driving to the hole to take 
advantage of Pomona’s early foul 
trouble. UCSD’s aggressive play even-
tually cut the lead to only two with 28 
seconds remaining in the game.

However, the Tritons fell just 
short, failing to find the extra buck-
et while the Broncos hit their free 
throws. 

“We really have to learn as a team 
to compete every possession for 40 
minutes,” VanDerveer said. “I think 
that we can be one of the elite teams 
in the league if we compete for forty 
minutes.” 

On Saturday, the visiting 
Humboldt State — 6–7 in the CCAA 
— upset the 8–6 Tritons.

UCSD shot poorly in the first 
half, sinking a paltry 19 percent of 
their shots on 4–21 shooting. UCSD 
finished the night shooting 30 per-
cent from the field as opposed to the 
Lumberjacks’ 42 percent.

“In the first three or four min-
utes I think we were in a pretty 
good rhythm, and then we took some 
really good shots that just didn’t go 

See WOMEN’S BASKETBALL, page 9

Triton Volleyball Still 
Without a Win in MPSF
UCSD Volleyball swept by No. 1 nationally ranked 
UCLA and reigning NCAA Champions UC Irvine.

The UCSD men’s volleyball team 
suffered its eighth straight defeat last 
week as it fell to both top-ranked 
UCLA and No. 8 UC Irvine.

With the two tough losses, the 
Tritons remain in last place in the 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, 
with a 0–8 conference record.

“A number of the teams [in the 
conference] have a lot of seniors, and 
we have a younger team,” UCSD head 
coach Kevin Ring said. “So every 
match for us, we have to get out there 

and try to get a little bit better. Our 
offense is struggling to keep the effi-
ciency throughout the games, but it 
was nice to see the offense come alive 
a little bit”.

Thursday night, UCSD hosted No. 
1 UCLA, who stepped into RIMAC 
Arena riding an eight-game winning 
streak.

UCSD won the first three points 
in the opening set before the Bruins 
took a 10–7 lead. The Tritons came 
back strong after Ring called a timeout, 
pulling to within one point at 16–15.
