Acrowd of over 800 students, faculty, staff and San Diego locals packed Library Walk 
on Thursday to protest student fee 
hikes and faculty furloughs, in a 
nationwide event named the March 4 
Day of Action.

According to a map on www.
studentactivism.net that charted all 
demonstrations across the U.S., there 
were about 44 protests in California 
alone — including regional rallies in

SRTV Charter 
Reapproved

Staff Writer

After being shut down on Feb. 18 by A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta in reaction to a controversial live broad-
cast of Koala TV, the Student-Run Television  station 
has been reapproved with a new charter. 

The A.S. Council voted on March 3 to reinstate the 
station with a new charter — one that prohibits live 
programming — as well as new name Triton Television. 

Vice President of Finance and Resources Peter 
Benesch and co-station manager Thomas Dadourian 
said the name change will help  to restore the station’s

Amid multiple Day of Action demonstra-
tions on March 4, leaders of the Black Student 
Union announced that the UCSD administra-
tion has agreed to their list of demands, and 
will work with the BSU to improve campus 
climate and increase diversity. 

According to BSU Vice Chair Fnann 
Keflezighi,  students have met periodically 
with administrators over the last two weeks 

— most recently, on March 1 — to share 
drafts of different plans and discuss how the 
demands could be implemented.

History professor Daniel Widener 
announced that the joint agreement had been 
signed during the March 4 rally, and thanked 
those who demonstrated over the past three 
weeks in support of the BSU.

“I want to say ‘Thank you’ to all the allies 
who have come out over the course of the past 
few weeks,” Widener said. “The mass action, 
the rallies, the protests, the demonstrations, 
the rejection of the racist bullshit that people 
here have been suggesting, has focused the 
eyes of the United States on UC San Diego.”

Potheads clinging religiously 
to their medical-marijuana cards 
can rest assured: UCSD’s Center 
for Medicinal Cannabis Research 
released a study on Feb. 11 confirm-
ing weed as a legitimate medical 
treatment.

According to J.H. Atkinson, 
co-director at CMRC, cannabis can 
significantly improve quality of life 
for patients suffering neuropathic 
pain — or, pain caused by damage to 
the nervous system from spinal-cord 
injuries or diseases like diabetes and 
multiple sclerosis.

“The major findings were that 
for chronic neuropathic pain, can-
nabis gave a good foundation — or 
good pain relief — that is roughly on 
par with the relief given by standard 
treatment,” Atkinson said.

The findings are backed by five 
clinical trials and four pre-clinical 
studies (meant to test a product’s 
safety before use on humans). In 
these trials, subjects with either HIV-
related or neuropathic pain smoked 
cannabis cigarettes, or joints, at vary-
ing concentrations. 

“Fifty percent of the patients in 
one trial had a pain reduction of 30 
percent or more, and that 30-percent 
reduction is known to be clinically 
important because it’s associated with 
a better quality of life,“ Atkinson said.

According to Atkinson, chronic 
pain is a serious affliction for those 
suffering long-term diseases, and 
can prevent them from carrying out 
everyday activities. For example, 
patients with multiple sclerosis expe-
rience disabling pain and muscle 
spasms, which could eventually 
deprive them of their ability to walk. 

“[One of the] findings was with 
the specificity of multiple sclerosis,” 

Atkinson said. “Cannabis provided 
moderate pain relief for the muscle 
spasms.” 

The study demonstrated that can-
nabis was just as effective as painkillers 
or pain relievers in treating neuropath-
ic pain. In addition, the trials revealed 
that marijuana’s efficiency does not 
depend on how much tetrohydrocan-
nabinol — the main active component 
of cannabis — the patient consumes.

“Low doses of cannabis were just 
as effective as higher doses,” Atkinson 
said.

In a second study, healthy subjects 
were injected with capsaicin — the 
“hot” ingredient in chili peppers — to 
induce pain after the subjects had 
smoked cannabis cigarettes. The 
results proved a narrow therapeutic 
range for concentrations of THC: 
While low doses of THC did not 
alleviate the effects of the capsaicin, 
higher doses actually increased the 
amount of pain subjects felt.

“There is a narrow therapeutic 
window — that is, a concentration of 
THC in the bloodstream — that was 
therapeutic, whereas all concentra-
tion above or below that amount were 
not,” Atkinson said. 

This finding suggests that the use 
of cannabinoids as a pain reliever 
is complex, and does not follow the 
mechanism of known pain relievers 
such as morphine or aspirin.

The participants were unknow-
ingly given cigarettes with or without 
THC to control for the placebo effect 
— a phenomenon where subjects 
convince themselves they are feeling 
less pain just because they think they 
have consumed medicine. The stud-
ies showed a significant reduction 
in pain with THC compared to the 
placebo.

The use of cannabis as a therapeu-
tic substance has been contested in 
both the scientific and political com-

munities due to its strong psychologi-
cal effects, and relatively unknown 
physiological ones. 

THC alters perception, cognitive 
control, emotions, memory and other 
psychological aspects. It can also 
cause anxiety, paranoia and increased 
susceptibility to psychosis. 

Due to the toxic and carcinogenic 
wastes emitted from cigarettes, the 
smoking of joints also has obvious 
health risks, including lung and heart 
diseases. 

A cleaner alternative to a joint or a 
bong known as a “volcano” vaporizes 
cannabis with heat to release its THC 
— which can then be inhaled without 
the carcinogens and toxic wastes from 
cigarettes. 

Though vaporizer trials have not 
been completed, preliminary CMCR 
studies show that vaporizers allow for 
the same amount of THC to circulate 
the system as marijuana cigarettes.

Like the many of you who haven’t yet succumbed to the real world of hard deadlines 
and meals that don’t come in a box, 
I’m a highly skilled procrastina-
tor. My unwillingness — inability, 
perhaps — to do things in a timely 

manner has historically ensured a 
number of things in life, ranging 
from a ‘B’ in British lit (gasp!) to a 
color-coded closet (well, OK, maybe 
there’s another reason for that). 
Until the other night, though, never 
had my penchant for procrastina-
tion offered me anything nearly so 
frightening as the intent gaze of a fif-
tysomething guy with a full orchard 
of chest hair, head resting gently on 
his pillow. 

Let me explain. 
On Thursday night, while most 

of my friends were out making hazy 
memories in Pacific Beach, I had 
the great fortune of staying in to 
write two papers — both overdue, 
thank you very much — sometime 
before the sun rose or the last of 
the Redbull wore off. After almost 
an hour of exerted effort, a hard-
earned study break was certainly 
in order — but with my polos still 
arranged in perfect rainbow order, 
my news feed devoid of any photo 
thumbnails worth clicking and my 
stomach already well past Nutter 
Butter capacity, I resorted to the one 
stalling mechanism surpassed in des-
peration only by flossing or clipping 
my toenails: AOL Instant Messenger. 

After a few minutes catching 
up with one of my oldest friends, 
it was revealed that she’d forged an 
unlikely bond with someone from 
Bulgaria who was on the rebound 
and conveniently built like a Greek 
god. She said they’d been introduced 
by something called Chat Roulette 
— which, evidently, is not a virtual

The past three weeks of race rallies notwithstanding, it’s pretty rare for most on this 
campus to care about something 
enough to band together and get 
noticed.            

So when Library Walk reached 
max capacity last Thursday, filled 
with students and faculty members 
protesting fee hikes, budget cuts, 
acts of racism and myriad other 
problems within the university, we 
felt a monumental shift from the 
routine air of apathy. Comparable 
to the Vietnam War protests —  
UCSD’s pinnacle of glory for any 
nostalgic activist — the Day of 
Action was the largest rally UCSD 
has seen since the 1960s.

Whereas the Sept. 24 walkout 
tended to confuse and alienate 
potential student participants by 
opting for angry chants over edu-
cational dialogue, last Thursday’s 
efforts, though jumbled, focused on 
enlightening onlookers. Organizers 

provided students with informa-
tional pamphlets on the roots of the 
university’s financial crisis — an 
important measure to ensure that 

participants 
know the 
basics of the 
issues, so 
that those 
students who 
do choose 
to be part 
of the rally 
aren’t merely 
doing so for 
an excuse to 
ditch class. 

Also of 
note is the 
fact that 
the Day of 

Action was not confined to Library 
Walk. Later in the afternoon, stu-
dents and faculty shuttled their 
picket signs to Balboa Park to con-
tinue the protest. While our collec-

tive off-campus efforts weren’t as 
awesome or eye-catching as those 
of UC Davis students, who were 
arrested for attempting to block a 
freeway entrance, or UC Santa Cruz 
students, whose protests resulted in 
a campus shutdown, we’re proud of 
the protesters who continued on at 
Balboa Park Thursday afternoon.

Reprioritizing public education 
in the state legislature will be no 
easy feat — and certainly not one 
that we can expect to realize without 
ample taxpayer support. In mov-
ing our cause away from campus, 
we attracted the attention of com-
munity members who probably 
haven’t felt the tangible effects of our 
deteriorating public education sys-
tem — a group whose support will 
be crucial in ensuring we receive the 
state funding we need at the voting 
booth. 

That said, as is inevitable with 
such a large and diverse group, 
a lesser degree of ignorance and 

indirectness was still present last 
Thursday. One prominent speaker, 
to the crowd’s applause, decried the 
fact that the university has contin-

No one wants to live next door to a sex offender — but not all those on the sex-registry list are as menacing as you think. 
After being convicted of rape, there’s no doubt that James 

Donnelly is a dangerous sex offender. But regulations like California’s 
minimum-distance law, which creates a 2,000-foot buffer between 
homes of sex offenders and schools or parks, also apply to those who 
have committed much lesser offenses. 

In California, you can be placed on the sex-offender registry 
even for mooning someone or peeing in public. By classifying minor 
infractions as “sex offenses,” the goal of Jessica’s Law is diluted.

Similarly, Megan’s Law was intended to create a database to pro-
tect communities from dangerous sex offenders — but a college stu-
dent who streaked across the field during a football game shouldn’t 
be lumped in the same category with the real sickos. As unpopular 
an initiative as it may be, California lawmakers need to reassess what 
constitutes a “sex offense.” Our current standards encompass any-
thing and everything remotely related to indecency, grouping teenage 
mistakes alongside lifelong obsessions with naked four-year-olds. 
Jessica’s Law also often forces sex offenders to be pushed into the 
same part of a city. California is unfairly punishing milder wrongdo-
ers by branding them with the worst of labels, for life.

Associate Opinion Editor 

Despite the fact that there’s a convicted sex offender liv-ing across the street from the local elementary school, 
Piedmont’s police force is absurdly lax on the issue, claiming 
that the situation is being dealt with and Donnelly is expected to 
relocate soon. 

But such a glaring oversight should be cause for major con-
cern. The 2,000-foot parameter established by Jessica’s Law is 
in place for a reason: to protect children from potentially risky 
scenarios, and provide less incentive for prior offenders. Such 
carelessness on the part of the Piedmont police force implies an 
underlying margin for further disregard of dangerous situations, 
exposing community members to perfectly avoidable danger in 
their own neighborhood. 

Though the Alameda County district attorney and the state 
attorney general consider Jessica’s Law unenforceable — a huge 
problem itself — allowing sex offenders to choose their neigh-
borhood without consideration of the law pushes well-founded 
community concerns to the wayside. Confining offenders to one 
part of the already crammed Bay Area might give the impression 
of a makeshift penitentiary, but given the alternative — of allow-
ing them to live near schools — is certainly the lesser of two evils. 

— Neda Salamat

James Donnelly, the registered sex offender and new neighbor of Wildwood Elementary School, in Piedmont, is the official 
guinea pig of a law that never quite reached puberty. Jessica’s 
Law — mandated in 2006 after its nine-year-old namesake was 
raped and murdered by a convicted sex offender — requires a 
minimum 2,000-foot distance separating the residence of a sex 
offender from any school in California. 

But this alleged step in the right direction to safeguard kids 
from regular perverts has proven to be in the case of Donnelly, 
nothing much more than a crinkled bulletin board memo that 
even the government is shrugging off.

Creating a law with no explicit consequences for violation is 
useless for obvious reasons. If no one’s going to get cuffed, what’s 
stopping the nearest kiddie-porn collector from moving next 
to a nest of preschoolers and choosing his next victim? The fact 
that no one is enforcing Jessica’s law — as evidenced by the fact 
that the Piedmont sex offender is still a leisurely stroll away from 
Wildwood’s gates — is a cause for nationwide concern. If proper 
punishments isn’t built into the law — and it could be as simple 
as an eviction notice — another child could be hurt — and we 
won’t be able to say we did all we could to prevent the situation.

THE RIVETER By Ronnie Steinitz

form of the lethal Russian game of 
chance, but an excuse for strangers 
to make meaningful conversation or 
show you their penis. 

Naturally, I was signed on within 
minutes. My friend had warned me 
that ChatRoulette.com — which 
allows users to video chat with per-
fect strangers — was a little different 
for guys than it was for her, but sure-
ly that wouldn’t stop me from meet-
ing a charming Eastern European all 
my own within 10 minutes. You can’t 
hurry love, but I was in no particular 
rush.

After a passing period’s worth of 
failure, though, I found my friend 
couldn’t have made a bigger under-

statement in noting the Web site was 
“different” for guys: It’s configured 
to automatically connect you to 
another user’s Web cam, but also 
provides the option of a “Next” but-
ton, should that stranger’s broadcast 
be unsatisfactory. It’s a useful tool, 
especially when you come across a 
pixilated stream of someone shield-
ing his face with a handwritten sign 
reading “Boobs?”

Most of the matches I came 
across in my extended study break 
were, like me, young, male and 
apparently looking for something 
highly specific. There were, however, 
a couple noted exceptions, such as 
the aforementioned fiftysomething, 
whose coy grin I only discovered 

after several minutes away from the 
page — and took as an irrefutable 
sign that it was high time I got back 
to that Spanish paper. 

After those fleeting minutes of 
creeped-out observation and half-
hearted hope, though, it occurred 
to me that even if the Internet can 
connect me with a saggy 50-year-old 
in five minutes flat it’s not exactly 
the most lucrative procrastination pit 
stop. I’ve got a towering pile of clean 
clothes to worry about before I dare 
start on whatever paper’s due next, 
but I think that next time, before I 
resort to Chat-Roulette desperation 
and risk another unintended stare-
down, I’ll take on the sock drawer 
instead.

Dear Editor,

As a current UCSD student, I am 
saddened to see the behavior on cam-
pus over the past two weeks — by all 
of the parties involved.   

What was originally intended as a 
tongue-in-cheek social event has been 
latched onto by an overly sensitive and 
zealous group of minority students, a 
weak faculty, sensationalist media and 
more misguided reactionaries.  

All of these parties add further 
flame to an ever-growing firestorm of 
bad press directed toward our great 
university, while the rest of the student 
body sits back in disbelief.

It is time to stop the growing 
national media storm denouncing our 
school, the cries of victim and “rac-
ism,” a pathetically late response by 
our faculty and staff and, most impor-
tantly, the inappropriate and insensi-
tive actions of a few juvenile students 
on campus. 

The Black Student Union’s 
response prompted Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox to send out a campuswide 
e-mail condemning the event, yet 
allowing her to side step punishing 
the parties involved for the behavior. 
This was perhaps a bad choice as well. 
Before these two responses, the event 
was relatively below the radar. The 
BSU’s reaction and Fox’s letter thus 
prompted the now-infamous retalia-
tory Koala TV broadcast.  

While allegedly using the offensive 
terminology of “ungrateful niggers” to 
condemn the BSU’s uproar, the Koala’s 
diatribe was historically no different 
from other previously juvenile satires 
of other minorities and majorities 
alike. The “Compton lynching” sign 
later recovered by police most likely 
referred to the social lynching the BSU 
was attempting against the fraternities 

in question, and it was not intended as 
a threat against the black community.  

The Koala broadcast has only 
emboldened the BSU and various fac-
ulty members to speak or act out, and 
this has escalated the national media 
attention on UCSD.

And, again, a cycle of action, reac-
tion and overreaction has occurred.

The crowd went wild when a stu-
dent hung a noose. This draws in the 
authorities and even more national 
media attention. Thus, the student 
confesses. But the twist is that she is 
a minority and apologizes. She is still 
suspended — but is she racist?

The crowd goes wild again, which 
in turn prompts someone else to act 
out. And we are now left with a Ku 
Klux Klan hood on our beloved Dr. 
Seuss statue. These escalations are 
growing on what should have always 
originally been a non-issue.  

What is happening on our campus 
is a cycle of insensitivity and stupidity, 
overreaction and attention and acting 
out by both sides again and again.    

An intended parody has brought 
us into the national spotlight, and as 
these actions become more absurd 
and extreme, we run the risk of a real 
danger or violence on our campus, 
as the UCSD name is drawn through 
the mud.

When you have a college consist-
ing of diverse backgrounds, someone 
at sometime is bound to be offended 
about something. 

But for the sake and dignity of 
UCSD as a community, we need to 
move on. We have an amazing school 
with a diverse set of students and 
faculty, and I have never felt a hint of 
racism before these past weeks.

Let’s stop this cycle now.

Dear Editor,

Thanks to Cheryl Hori for her 
review of the Carnival Cruise to 
Mexico. I will pass it along to the 500-
plus members of the Osher Lifelong 
Learning Institute on campus, so they’ll 
know what to avoid. We are all “teeter-
ing between retirement and death” and 
have lost our interest in spending time 
with drunks under 21 who get off on 
smuggling cheap booze in their back-
packs. Please send more of her reviews! 
I do have to say that, for this geezer 
at least, the other travel articles were 
informative, respectful and inspired 
me to get off my rocker and explore 
— especially Uganda and the Amazon. 
Sincere thanks for those.

Dear Editor,

I’ve been working at the Shiley 
Eye Center since June 2008. When I 

started, I was appalled to learn that 
there is no recycling program here. 
I did everything I could to try to 
have one set up: I contacted UCSD’s 
sustainability group, facilities and the 
person in charge of Shiley. They all 
met to discuss how to start a recycling 
program, but nothing ever came of it. 
You wouldn’t believe how much paper 
is just thrown away here every day; it’s 
truly unbelievable. I get so frustrated 
when I hear UCSD saying how green 
it is when the east side of campus is 
so wasteful. Last time I looked into 
it, I couldn’t find out whether or not 
Thornton Hospital or Moores Cancer 
Center has a recycling program. I’m 
writing you this in hopes that raising 
awareness of this problem can some-
how help things get done here.

▶ PROTEST, MYVT�WHNL��
ued with on-campus construction 
projects despite our financial crisis 
— avoiding the fact that the money 
used to fund construction projects is 
set aside for highly specific purposes 
and cannot legally be used to cur-
tail fee increases. Others still toted 
their “Lay off Yudof ” signs from Fall 
Quarter, evidently oblivious of the 
fact that our university’s problems 
run far deeper than one high-paid 
suit with a corner office in Oakland. 

Of course, it wouldn’t be a cam-
pus protest if comprised solely of 
well-informed, passionate dissenters. 
What’s more important is that the 
campus community turned out in 
such record numbers. A small, dis-
organized faction of rabble rousers 
interrupting lectures won’t intimi-
date the UC Regents or state law-
makers — but an enormous assem-
bly of pissed-off students and faculty 
members might just raise enough of 
a ruckus to shake Sacramento. 

Let’s not forget that on the same 
day of the protest, the Black Student 
Union announced that after two 
weeks of fighting, it had finally 
reached an agreement with the 
administration regarding its list of 
demands in response to a series of 
racist events on campus. We need 
look no further for evidence that 
a peaceful, organized expression 
of indignation can yield tangible 
results — and that’s precisely why 
our momentum can’t stop here. 

A single nationwide day of action 
is a noble start. In order to main-
tain UC accessibility and quality, 
students and faculty members can’t 
simmer down — not until state leg-
islators, the regents and the voting 
body of California recognize that 
we’re a force to be reckoned with.

NEWS� MONDAY, MARCH 8, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 

Keflezighi also spoke about the importance 
of diversity in the undergraduate popula-
tion and the difficulties faced by historically 
underrepresented students.

“When we get here, we need to feel com-
fortable,” she said. “I come here to be a stu-
dent, but the reality is I’m not a student first, 
I’m an activist first, and I think the university 
needs to understand that.”

Keflezighi said all the BSU demands were 
met.

“We fought hard for all our demands, but 
the one we’re especially proud of is matching 
funds for S.P.A.C.E.S.,” she said.

S.P.A.C.E.S., or the Student Promoted 
Access Center for Education and Service, is 
a collaborative area in the Cross-Cultural 
Center designed to empower minorities.

In implementing the demands, the admin-
istration has created two task forces: one to 
recruit minority faculty and another to find 
ways to improve the student-body climate to 
be friendlier for minorities.

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox agreed to 
fund BSU-initiated yield programs —  which 
will work to ensure that more black students 
enroll and graduate —  for at least the next 
three years, and fill the program-coordinator 
position for the African-American studies 
minor  and the Chicano/a and Latino/a arts 
and humanities minor.

Administrators also promised to establish 
a resource center for black, Chicano and 
Native-American communities, and do all 
they can toward returning ancient Native-
American remains found 
on campus grounds to the 
Kumeyaay nation.

Chancellor Fox and Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue could not be reached 
for comment.

UC President Mark Yudof 
and Fox announced on March 
5 that Dean of UC Berkeley 
School of Law Christopher 
Edley has been appointed to 
advise UCSD on improving its 
campus climate.

Edley said he will meet with 
the administration and BSU 
members on March 9. 

“Through these and subse-
quent meetings, [we] will devel-
op a plan for how I might be 
useful,” he said. “It depends on 
what people believe they need 
in light of what’s already been 
agreed, and we’ll take it from there. I definitely 
will not be providing legal counsel in the for-
mal sense.” 

Former UC Regent Ward Connerly will 
also review UCSD’s plan of action to deter-
mine if it violates the California Constitution. 
Connerly, who founded the American Civil 
Rights Institute, helped pass Proposition 209 
in 1996, which prohibits the consideration of 
sex and race in UC admissions.

“We have attorneys as part of our entourage 
to review the plan and determine if it complies 
with Prop. 209,” Connerly said. “We’re primar-
ily interested in if preferential treatment is 
being accorded for black students.”

Connerly stressed that it is not wrong for 
the university to make steps toward increasing 
campus diversity. 

“There’s no problem with the university 
reaching out to make sure everyone, regard-

less of ethnicity, is encouraged 
to apply and receive equal 
treatment,” he said. “But the 
university cannot take action 
designed to give someone 
preference — for example, in 
hiring faculty or in admis-
sions — based on race.”

Connerly said he has no 
timeline for the review, but in 
his preliminary opinion, the 
university’s plans are ques-
tionable, but not illegal. 

“Personally, I think it’s 
distasteful for the universi-
ty, under duress, to sit down 
with a group of students rep-
resenting racial interest and 
agree to their demands,” he 
said. “What about white stu-
dents, what if they want more 
diversity? But that’s not a legal 
issue, that’s just inappropri-

ate public-policy making. They can make 
promises all they want, but they don’t violate 
anything until they take action.”

Keflezighi said that, despite recent prog-
ress, the BSU still has work to do.

“This isn’t a victory,” said Keflezighi. “This 
is a step toward victory, but there’s a whole lot 
of work, language and charters that need to be 
written. We’re nowhere near victory.”

The full list of demands and their imple-
mentation can be found online at www.battle-
hate.ucsd.edu/whatarewedoing.php.

News Editor

Students affected by recent campus tur-
moil can now petition to withdraw from their 
Winter Quarter classes without receiving a ‘W’ 
on their transcript. 

The policy was approved by the UCSD 
Committee of Educational Policy on March 2, 
then announced to the student body via e-mails 
from the college provosts. In addition, students 
who have already withdrawn from one or more 
classes can petition to have those ‘W’s  removed 
from their transcipts.

According to CEP Chair Stefan Llewellyn-
Smith, students must first work with both 
their academic counselor and college provost 
to discuss other academic options. They must 
then file an Undergraduate Student Petition to 
withdraw without a ‘W,’ explaining why with-
drawal is necessary and how academic work 
has been negatively affected. The committee 
will approve requests only after students have 
followed all these steps.

Both Llewellyn-Smith and James Levin, vice 
chair of the CEP, said the special policy was 
created to offer students academic flexibility 
in light of racial tensions on campus, including 
three protests during Week Eight. 

Llewellyn-Smith said the committee, which 
hashed out the policy over e-mail, was unani-
mously in favor of offering students the chance 
to remove their ‘W’s. 

“These are important requests that don’t just 
come out of blue,” he said. “They’re not arbi-
trary constructs. This is for students in unusual, 
exceptional situations.”

Llewellyn-Smith and Levin agreed the 
option should be a last resort. 

“We hope that students can find an alternate 
to this since they would be losing the quarter,” 
Levin said. “We really want students to find 
other options and work with their counselors 
before turning to this. But if all else fails, we hope 
this will reduce the stress level of the students.”

Llewellyn-Smith has approved one request 
so far, and said he may receive more in the 
coming week. 

Although the regular deadline to withdraw 
from specific courses passed on March 5, the 
deadline to withdraw from all classes without 
a ‘W’ has been extended to Friday, March 12.

8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, MARCH 8, 2010� NEWS

Los Angeles and Sacramento, walkouts 
at high schools and community col-
leges and a demonstration at each UC 
campus.

The UCSD turnout was about 800, 
tying with UC Berkeley and outnum-
bering the other eight UC campuses, 
which reported turnouts of 300 to 500 
people. A.S. Campuswide Senator and 
rally organizer Bryant Pena attributed 
this to the recent activism against rac-
ism on campus.

“The racial incidents helped mobi-
lize our community and the rest of 
campus in response of what hap-
pened,” Pena said.  “When I was on 
stage in front of Geisel, I couldn’t see 
where the amount of people ended on 
Library Walk.”

The demonstration was coor-
dinated by the UCSD Coalition for 
Educational Justice and the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee.

The morning started with a Black 
Student Union rally at the Chancellor’s 
Complex, followed by a Faculty Press 
Conference in the Cross-Cultural 
Center. At 11:30 a.m., students and 
teachers walked out of their class-
rooms to gather at Gilman Parking 
Structure, where they marched to a 
rally in front of Geisel Library.

At about 1:30 p.m., buses began 
shuttling protesters to Balboa Park, 
where UCSD protestors joined a group 
of 2,000 more for the All San Diego 
Rally and marched to Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger’s San Diego office.

Though no one was arrested at 
UCSD’s protest, about 150 protesters 
at Berkeley’s event — including 37 
students — were arrested after block-
ing off the Interstate Highway 880, 
according to student-run newspa-
per the Daily Cal. Berkeley students 
also joined a crowd of 10,000 in San 
Francisco — the largest demonstration 
in the state.

At UC Santa Cruz, protestors 
blocked all traffic from entering and 
exiting the campus from 6 a.m. into 
the afternoon. UCSC officials released 
a “safety warning” that shut down the 

campus until 4:45 p.m.
Ralliers at UC Davis also tried to 

block the freeway, but met a blockade 
of 120 police officers that prevented 
them from making their way onto the 
Interstate 80. The protest dispersed 
after police fired pepper spray into a 
crowd of about 300 people and arrest-
ed one student, according to student-
run newspaper the Aggie.

California wasn’t the only state 
up in arms; over 100 demonstrations 
were held across the nation. According 
to the student-run University of 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee Post, 16 pro-
testors at UWM were arrested when 
police turned them away from an 
administrative building and students 
became violent, throwing punches and 
chunks of ice.

At UCSD, in an effort to educate 
students during the weeks leading up 
to the Day of Action, a campaign called 
“Let This Be Public Now” — organized 
by graduate students in the visual-arts 
department — provided informational 
flyers offering support to the BSU, the 
Coalition for Educational Justice and 
other systemwide initiatives. The flyers 
covered the effects of the California 
funding cuts on the UC system.

The campaign culminated on 
March 4, where supporters like visual-
arts graduate student Artie Vierkant 
wove through the crowd, taping fly-
ers to streetlamps and walls, handing 
pamphlets to people walking by. 

The UCSD rally in front of Geisel 
was emceed by Chevelle Newell — a 
member of the BSU — and Pena. 
Performances included a spoken-word 
and dance piece by the Art Collective, 
along with speeches from students, 
staff and professors. 

“Today is about everyone coming 
out, showing support for change and 
that we’re actually going to go forth 
with action,” Art Collective performer 
and Revelle College freshman Shunya 
Wade said. “We’re not just talking any-
more about being upset with things, 
but actually coming with solutions to 
table and saying ‘This is what we want 
to happen,’ and we will continue to 

fight for it until it does happen.” 
Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 

Jake Blanc, a representative from 
the UCSD Coalition for Educational 
Justice, listed the coalition’s five 
demands — including access to public 
higher education, respect for univer-
sity workers, transparency in drafting 
university budgets and a change to 
the composition of the UC Board of 
Regents. He said the board should 
be renamed the “People’s Board of 
Representatives of the University of 
California” and replace its governor-
appointed members with three under-
graduates, two graduate students and 
five faculty members. 

Lincoln High School freshman 
Vanessa Bandith joined 80 of her 
classmates to march alongside UCSD 
students at the campus protest.  

“I’m here to fight for my education 
in the future, to be able to go to college 
without any worries,” Bandith said. 

UCSD groundskeeper Jorge Olvera 
and carpenter David Roger also 
marched to protect higher education. 

“We are supporting our brothers 
and sisters in different community 
colleges,” Olvera said. “Our fight is the 
same fight. Our university system has 
a great impact on the state. It’s critical 
that the community that we are part of 
understands how critical it is for us to 
take it to the streets.”

At 5:12 p.m., the downtown-San 
Diego crowd sat in the street parallel 
to the front entrance to the governor’s 
office. Speakers — including Revelle 
College senior Sam Jung and Marshall 
College freshman Grant White — 
addressed the crowd, as police cars 
blocked off the streets.

“As one of the organizers, I was 
incredibly happy,” Pena said. “It’s defi-
nitely one of the biggest things we’ve 
seen on this campus. Most of the orga-
nizers are in the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee, and to see the rest 
of campus and folks from the universi-
ty community involved was amazing.”

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, MARCH 8, 2010� NEWS

“A lot of people were offended by 

what happened that Thursday some 
weeks ago, and keeping that same 
tag on the station would be like say-
ing ‘Hey, this is more of the same,’” 
Dadourian said. “We really wanted 
to make sure that students knew that 
was not what the Associate Students’ 
television network is all about.”

Benesch said that, in light of the 
Feb. 18 broadcast, the ban on live 
content is necessary.

“We did have station managers in 
the past approving content that went 
on the air,” Benesch said. “There were 
a lot of problems with that, though. 
Basically, individuals could — one 
way or another — gain access to the 
facility by saying that they have the 
approval of the station managers.”

Dadourian agreed that the old 
system was ineffective.

“It was horribly defunct and con-
tained positions that never really 
existed, like operations manager,” he 
said. 

In addition to nixing live pro-
gramming, TTV’s charter places 
heavier restrictions on students look-
ing to broadcast new material. TTV 
hopefuls must first find a “producer” 
— an SRTV member trained to over-
see content — to sponsor their show, 
then run the concept past station 
managers Dadourian and Ali Hadian 
for approval. 

If future content is deemed 
questionable, it will be presented to 
the Program Review Panel — co-

chaired by Dadourian and Hadian 
— which includes Gupta, Associate 
Vice President of Student Services 
Meredith Madnick, two TTV offi-
cers, one producer unaffiliated with 
the station and two A.S. senators. 

The PRP reserves the right, along 
with the station managers, to reject a 
show’s proposal. However, anyone is 
welcome to appeal the PRP’s decision 
at the next A.S. Council meeting. 
Once the show is approved, produc-
ers are responsible for individually 
monitoring each episode’s content 
to prevent the airing of controversial 
material.

The station has a long history 
of controversy and censorship. In 
2005, it was shut down after Koala 
TV creator Steve York made national 
headlines by airing a video of himself 
having sex with an adult-film actress.

Benesch said TTV’s new charter 
mandates far more A.S oversight.

“The [charter] was literally 
scrapped and started from scratch,” 
Benesch said. “In the past, we didn’t 
give the station editor much direc-
tion. The new system is explained in 
much better detail.”

The charter’s broadcast rules 
prohibit airing obscene material 
— defined as  anything depicting 
or describing sexual content in an 
offensive manner and lacking in lit-
erary, artistic, political or scientific 
value. Indecent material — obscene, 
sexual or excretory — is also banned 
from airing between the hours of 6 
a.m. and 10 p.m.

Benesch considers these new 

restrictions practical, seeing as TTV 
is the A.S. Council’s official station.

“[The council] decides what it will 
say — this isn’t some venue where all 
students can come and say whatever 
it is they feel like they want to say on 
television,” he said. “Basically, it’s a 
venue where by Associated Students 
is communicating with the general 
students. Associated Students is cen-
soring itself.”

As a result, Dadourian said he 
doubts that Koala TV will ever reap-
pear.

“I’m sad that a media organiza-
tion is banned, but based on our 
current history, it’s probably in TTV’s 
best interest,” Dadourian said.

Despite the restrictions, 
Dadourian said he hopes to bring 
delayed programming — which puts 
off a live stream for a small amount 
of time — to TTV.

 “We still aren’t sure [if there will 
be delayed television] … We’re trying 
to do some creative financing and 
minimize costs as much as possible,” 
he said. 

Dadourian said that TTV will 
launch during Week One of Spring 
Quarter. He said hopes to implement 
a new advertising campaign, logo 
and Web site along with the launch.

“I kind of feel sad SRTV’s gone, 
but at the same time, I’m excited 
to get a new opportunity,” he said. 
“Hopefully this new system will legit-
imize us.”

“We found that the concentration 
of THC was very comparable — a 
vaporizer did just as well to deliver 
THC as a cigarette,” Atkinson said. 

Politically, the use of cannabis 
— whether through cigarettes or a 
vaporizer — has been highly con-
tested since the federal Marihuana 
Tax Act first made the drug illegal in 
1937. 

Currently, policymakers like 
Michele Leonhardt, head of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, worry 
that dispensaries — pharmacies 
that specifically distribute medical 
marijuana — would open the door to 

more widespread use of illegal drugs. 
Though medical marijuana is 

illegal under federal law and the 
DEA frequently raids dispensaries, 12 
states — including California — allow 
dispensaries to distribute cannabis to 
those with medical-marijuana cards. 
These cards, which can be prescribed 
to a patient by a physician, state that 
the patient needs marijuana to help 
treat symptoms like pain or insomnia.

Because THC remains in fat cells 
for approximately one month, poli-
cymakers are also concerned about 
marijuana’s effects on driving ability. 
Studies at the Lakehead University 
in Ontario have shown that cannabis 

impairs motor skills.
Though UCSD scientists con-

trolled the exact amount of THC 
in the cigarettes they administered, 
Atkinson said that doctors at dispen-
saries do not know the concentration 
of THC in the goods they distribute, 
which makes it difficult to prescribe. 
As the study shows, too much THC 
can actually increase pain.

“I do not think that you can take 
our results and apply them directly to 
what is available to the streets or in 
dispensaries,” Atkinson said.

“ Have you met me!? I just ate an entire jar of peanut butter.” 4:37 P.M.
TIOGA HALL

1 early 10,000 years after three tribal fishermen were buried in what is now the ritzy enclave of La Jolla Farms — just west of the Muir College campus — their bones have yet to find a final resting place.Ever since the remains were uncovered by archeology students from Cal State Northridge in 1976, the UCSD administration and the Kumeyaay 
nation — an American-Indian tribe that hails from Southern California 
and Northern Mexico — have been fighting over the rights to the bones. 
Though the two parties reached a stalemate last year after the university 
refused to deem the remains “culturally affiliated” with the Kumeyaay 
nation, recent unrest on campus has rekindled the dispute. 

The Black Student Union’s list of demands, released three weeks ago to 
address racial insensitivity at UCSD, included a request that the university 
cooperate with the Kumeyaay nation. Now, in a joint statement with the 
BSU on Mar. 4, Chancellor Marye Anne Fox has pledged a commitment 
to continue working toward a resolution with the Kumeyaay nation.

The bones are some of the oldest ever found in the Western Hemisphere. 
They were unearthed from the land beneath Chancellor Fox’s University 
House — purchased by UCSD in 1967 as an official residence for chancel-
lors, and to host events and fundraisers. Though Fox doesn’t actually live in 
the house (NAGPRA) it was deemed structurally unsound in 2004), it’s been 
a site of heated contention between the university and the Kumeyaay nation.

Because the Northridge archeology students discovered the remains on university 
property, they are currently under UC control — stored in a safe at the San Diego 
Archaeological Center in Escondido. Since their discovery, the artifacts have been 
shipped to various locations across the country, displayed at prestigious museums 
like the Smithsonian and studied with particular scrutiny for their age — all amid 
pleas by local American-Indians to have the ancestral remains returned and reburied. 

According to the Native-American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 
1990, all institutions that receive federal funding must return American-Indian cul-
tural artifacts and human remains when a tribe can prove “cultural affiliation.”

The law stipulates that an artifact is culturally affiliated with a tribe’s heritage if 
there is evidence of a connection “based on geographical, kinship, biological, archeo-
logical, linguistic, folklore, oral tradition, historical evidence or other information or 
expert opinion.”

The Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriations Committee — a group formed by the San 
Diego County Kumeyaay tribes in 1998 — submitted a request to UCSD administra-
tors in 2006 asking for the remains to be reburied, claiming they were Kumeyaay 
ancestors. According to members of the committee, though 29 sets of bones were dug 
up in 1976, only the three in question are accounted for. 

Two years later in 2008, the university put together a faculty panel of two anthro-

10 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, MARCH 8, 2010� FOCUS

T ake a smooth bike ride down Expedition Way off North Torrey Pines Road, and you’ll find yourself gazing up at a 10-foot seascape, painted behind an even larger 
whale sculpture. The entrance to the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography’s Birch Aquarium — directly across from the 
Splash Cafe, with ample bike parking alongside it — feeds into a 
large gallery. A swarm of volunteers await you there, hoping for 
a chance to spew infinite knowledge on the aquarium’s exhibits 
— including the Hall of Fishes, the Scripps Explorers Gallery on 
Climate Change and the Education Courtyard. 

A dark hallway just to the right of the Pacific Sardine tank 
— thick with shimmering, silver-scaled fish — will lead you 
into the Hall of Fishes. Here, leopard sharks, iridescently orange 
girabaldi fish and octopi serve as appetizers for the main course: 
a 13,000-gallon kelp forest from floor to ceiling, filled to the 
brim with stingrays, shovel-nose guitar fish and an awesome 
400-pound bass. 

The majority of the Hall of Fishes is devoted to sea life from 
California coastal habitats, from the Pacific Northwest to Baja. 
But if you’re looking for a getaway, skip the local educational 
displays and check out the small aquarium section devoted to 
tropical specimen.

Or, those hoping to unleash their inner fourth-grader can 
take a field trip to the tide pools to gawk at some of the slimier 
ocean stuffs. Goobery sea cucumbers, scuttling hermit crabs 
and bright seastars are all within arm’s reach. And even in the 
off-chance that the pools aren’t so hoppin’, an authentic, brisk 

ocean breeze makes it cool to be 
chill. 

The aquarium’s third wing 
focuses on recent research from 
Scripps, with interactive displays 

and games for all those visitors who are actually four-year-
olds. To avoid a trail of sticky fingers, escape to the “2050 
Television Newsroom,” where you can broadcast your own 
weather report and prediction of what the world may be 
like in the future.

But if you become overwhelmed with mental images of 
a barren planet, seek refuge in the next display: “There’s 
Something About Seahorses.” Though the aquarium’s new-
est exhibit is only about a quarter of the size of the fishes 
hall, its freakish beauty makes up for it. 

If you’ve only seen seahorses in National Geographic 
spreads, you’ll be shocked to learn how small these peculiar 
creatures are: The dwarf species measures just over half an 
inch. The Scripps’ captive-breeding portion of the exhibit 
contains three tanks with tiny baby seahorses tightly clasping 
their tails to blades of grass in simulated current. Even better 
is the exhibit’s finale — a tank full of stunning sea dragons. 
If you had been mindlessly wandering, the dragon display 
will give the trip its sense of purpose. Playing weird, mon-
strous uncle to the seahorse, the dragons are orange- and 
red-striped creatures with translucent leaf-like appendages 
protruding from every angle of their bodies.

Cool down with the few remaining tanks filled with some 
of Birch Aquarium’s best and brightest — like the red- and 
yellow-striped pipefish or the Pacific Spiny Lumpsucker — 
who could double as a ping-pong-ball.

CLUBHOPPING

T hough it may not turn you into the next Bobby Flay, the Cuisine Club can help you 
become less dependent on your 
regular Chipotle burrito. And it all 
started with sponge cake. While 
hunting for a recipe, Muir senior 
Frances Tang stumbled upon a link 
to the University of Washington’s 
Cuisine Club. Intrigued by the 
concept of a student org for food-
ies, Tang founded a cooking club at 
UCSD by the end of last quarter. 

Though she doesn’t have very 
much time to advertise her culinary 
cause, the Facebook group Tang 
created has already attracted 461 
members. 

“Many people who contacted me 
asking for information about the 
club were brand new to cooking,” 
Tang said. “I know some people who 
can’t even operate a rice cooker.” 

Along with fellow founding 
members Warren junior Robert 
Holm-Kennedy, Marshall senior 
Ryan Seely, Marshall junior Victor 
Chun and Muir senior Christopher 
Auyeung, Tang envisions the club 
as a laidback environment for food 

lovers to get together and learn new 
techniques and recipies. 

The club is organized into 
three main divisions: sampling 
different restaurants, holding 
culinary workshops and organizing 
potlucks that vary from comfort 
foods to foods of specific colors. 
The Cuisine Club’s next event will 
focus on creating pizzas and omelets 
according to different skillsets — 
from the amateur who burns water 
to the most seasoned epicure.

“It’s all about the members — 
we all learn together regardless of 
experience level,” Tang said.

The Cuisine Club’s Facebook 
group showcases an impressive 
photo collection of dishes prepared 
by the club’s members so far.
Their first event — an open potluck 
with one stipulation: No chips unless 
they’re homemade — was held a 
week before finals last quarter, and 
attracted around 10 to 15 attendees. 
People brought a diverse selection 
of foods, ranging from Spanish to 
Korean.

CUISINE CLUB
pologists, an ethnic-studies profes-
sor and a retired professor from the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography to 
determine if the bones could be identi-
fied as “culturally affiliated.” The panel 
ultimately concluded there was no 
evidence of cultural affiliation between 
the remains and any living tribes.

“Although there is evidence from 
material culture that people have lived 
in the San Diego region since the late 
Pleistocene or early Holocene, the 
linguistic analyses and archaeological 
evidence indicate that the Kumeyaay 
moved into the region within the last 
few thousand years,” read the panel’s 
final report, released in May 2008.

In a statement made to the 
Guardian in May 2009, spokesman for 
the KCRC Steve Banegas expressed his 
dissatisfaction with the panel’s conclu-
sions. Banegas claimed the unique 
burial positions of the bodies in fact 
reflect an affiliation with the Kumeyaay 
culture. According to the KCRC, the 
position of one young man in par-
ticular — curled up with two severed 
fingers placed in his mouth — was evi-
dence of the tribe’s burial rituals.

“We know that they are cultur-
ally identifiable,” Banegas said. “All 
we want is to merely rebury them … 
respect them and treat them as the 
human beings that they once were.”

Immediately following the panel’s 
report, Vice Chancellor of Resource 
Management and Planning Gary 
Matthews asked the UC Office of the 
President to recommend that the U.S. 
Department of the Interior — the 
branch of government officially in 
charge of Native American affairs — 
to return and rebury the bones. 

Ultimately, in early summer 2008, 
the university withdrew its request 
for repatriation due to lack of sup-
port from the KCRC, which remained 
staunchly opposed to the panel’s clas-
sification of the remains as “culturally 
unidentifiable.”

Almost a year later, the issue of 

repatriation has returned to the spot-
light. In late December 2009, UCSD 
administrators met with National 
NAGPRA Program Manager Sherry 
Hutt to discuss the university’s options. 
The immediate effects of this meeting 
are uncertain, but — according to Vice 
Chancellor of Research Art Ellis — 
the bones can only be returned if the 
faculty panel declares the bones to be 
affiliated with the Kumeyaay.

“UCSD supports the Kumeyaay 
nation’s request to have the remains 
discovered in 1976 repatriated. 
However, until federal law is changed 
to allow the remains to be repatriated 
even if they are not “culturally affili-
ated” we are prohibited from doing 
so,” Ellis said.

Ethnic-studies professor Ross 
Frank, the sole dissenter in the fac-
ulty panel’s conclusion two years ago, 
echoed Ellis’ pessimism that the bones 
would be repatriated. 

“There are complicated things 
happening,” Frank said. “As long as 
the supposed archaeological value 
can be harvested from these human 
remains, there really isn’t any easy way 
to resolve this.”

According to Frank, the panel’s 
conclusions on the cultural identity of 
the bones were biased by the fact that 
they remain scientifically valuable. 

On Feb. 5, Marshall College junior 
and AS AVP of Local Affairs Aries 
Rivers Yumul led a group of about 
60 students on a march to the chan-
cellor’s office, chanting “No debate, 
repatriate” with the goal of calling new 
attention to the issue.

Yumul, who is an American Indian 
student himself, collected over 100 
signatures from students in favor of 
returning the bones to the Kumeyaay 
tribe, stressing to the Chancellor that 
they were indeed “culturally affili-
ated.” According to Yumul, as a result 
of the march, Chancellor Fox and 
Vice Chancellor Matthews responded 
promptly via e-mail. 

“They really do understand how 

important [this issue] is to the student 
body,” Yumul said.

Professor Frank, also present at the 
march, said that the repatriation is a 
concern of many students. 

“It’s about campus climate … the 
ability to attract Native-American 
students and about thinking through 
what the larger ethical and moral 
implications are of the university’s 
research actions,” Frank said.

There are currently 90 American-
Indian students enrolled at UCSD, one 
of whom is Kumeyaay —only about 
0.004% of the student body in a coun-
ty housing more American-Indian res-
ervations than any other in the U.S. 

“The fact that the university has 
remains of the native tribe is a deter-
rent for many native students in the 
community,” Yumul said.

The BSU recently made reference 
to the underrepresented American-
Indian population in its Feb. 26 “State 
of Emergency” address, which includ-
ed a list of demands toward creating a 
more minority-friendly campus.

“We stand in solidarity and strug-
gle with all other marginalized and 
underrepresented communities on 
the UCSD campus, which include but 
are not limited to our fellow Native-
American and indigenous brothers 
and sisters fighting for the repatriation 
of ancestral remains,” the BSU stated. 

 With Chancellor Fox’s renewed 
verbal commitment to resolving the 
repatriation issue — in response to 
the community’s reinvigorated interest 
in the matter — it remains to be seen 
whether the years-long back-and-
forth will finally end in peace.

 “In the future, any recovered 
archaeological artifacts will be coor-
dinated with on-site Native-American 
monitors,” Ellis said. “We also con-
tinue to have an open dialogue with 
the Native-American community as 
we move through this process.”

Unfortunately, the Tritons lost 
momentum in the fourth set. The 
Cardinals took advantage of this lag 
to claim a final 30-20 victory.

Although the match did not end 
as the Tritons had hoped, individual 
players still came out on top. Junior 
opposite hitter Joel Davidson led 
with 17 kills, sophomore opposite 
hitter Carl Eberts added 10 kills on 
.364 hitting and Kiani and freshman 
opposite hitter Alex Simon had 
nine kills each. Senior setter Erik 
Sierks contributed 34 assists and 
sophomore libero Andrew Kaban 
made eight digs.

The Tritons squared off against 
the University of the Pacific in 
Stockton on March 6. Coming 
off the previous night’s loss, the 
team was determined to turn 
things around. Hard work and 
steady momentum paid off when 
the Tritons defeated Stockton 
31-29, 30-17, 33-35, 30-24. The 
victory marked the Tritons’ fifth 
consecutive win over the Tigers 
in as many meetings, bumping 
UCSD’s record to 6-23 overall and 
3-11 in MPSF play.

The first set began as an even 
battle. After working hard to tie 
the set score at 24 apiece, the Tigers 
took the lead 29-28. However, 
UCSD managed to claim the hard-
fought set after a triple block and a 
kill by Fritsch took the score to 31-
29.

UCSD kept a steady pace to 
claim the second set 30-17.

Unexpectedly, the Tigers rallied 
to an early 7-1 lead in the third 
set. UCSD caught up momentarily 
to tie the score at 14-14; however 
Stockton emerged on top of a 35-33 
score.

“We had opportunities to win 
the third set, but the loss was a 
heartbreaker,” Ring said. “We didn’t 
want Pacific to gain momentum 
with the win, so we had to start off 

with a quick lead.”
Although the lead seesawed 

between the teams several times, 
the Tritons held on until the very 
end of the fourth set and claimed 
it 30-24, thanks to a kill by senior 
outside hitter Jason Spangler and a 
Tiger service error.

The win reflected strong 
individual performances from a 
few key players. Fritsch led with 19 
kills, while junior middle blocker 

Adrian Guthals had 13 kills and 
nine blocks. Spangler contributed 
13 kills and 11 digs. Kiani added 12 
kills, and junior setter Phil Bannan 
led in assists with 58.

The Tritons will return to action 
when they travel to Romeoville, Ill., 
to face off against Lewis University 
on March 12 and March 13.

percent from the field, and were 8-of-12 
on three-pointers in the second half.

“Any time a team shoots that well 
from the three-point line, you’re going 
to have your hands full,” head coach 
Charity Elliot said.

While Humboldt was on fire from 
beyond the arc, the Tritons were 
abysmal, hitting just two of 17 three-
point attempts. 

Two Triton centers — junior 
Charity Smith and sophomore Lauren 
Freidenberg — combined for 18 points in 
the first half, keeping the team in the game 
despite a strong start from Humboldt. The 
Lumberjacks shot over 53 percent from 
the field in the first half, but thanks to the 
Triton post players, the teams went into 
the break with the score tied at 35. 

Smith finished with her first career 
double-double, tallying 13 points and 13 
rebounds. Freidenberg posted 11 points 
and six rebounds.

Humboldt found its range in the 
second half, hitting multiple three 
pointers to widen the lead by as many 
as eight points. Ilg, who scored 17 of her 
21 points in the second half and grabbed 
seven rebounds, kept the Tritons alive, 
converting a three-point play with 3:15 
remaining to give the Tritons a short-
lived 70-69 advantage.

However, the lead was erased when 
the home side went on a quick 6-0 run. 

A layup by Ilg with 1:07 remaining cut 
the lead to one, but the Lumberjacks held 
their nerve at the line in the final minutes 
to seal the win. The loss dropped UCSD 
to 25-4 overall.

Senior guard Brittany Taylor and 
senior center Paige Peterson carried 
the Lumberjacks with 16 points each, 
pushing Humboldt to its second straight 
CCAA title game. Humboldt went on to 
win the CCAA tournament, pummeling 
Chico State with a score of 85-55. 

This was the third time the Tritons 
played the Lumberjacks this season; 
in their first two games the home team 
emerged victorious. Seeded No. 4 in the 
CCAA tournament, the Lumberjacks 
ended the Tritons’ perfect 14-0 start to 
the season with an 84-80 victory on Jan. 
21. However, when the teams met again 
at UCSD on Feb. 26, the Tritons came out 
on top with a 86-51 blowout victory.

UCSD is now 3-3 all-time in the 
CCAA tournament, after being knocked 
out in the first round last year and losing 
in the title game to Chico the year before.

The Tritons await the selection 
committee’s announcement if the NCAA 
Division-II West Regional field. The team 
is hoping to receive the No. 1 seed, which 
would allow UCSD to host the first three 
rounds of the regional tournament.

in the long jump, surpassed only by 
UCSD junior Stephanie LeFever. Senior 
Marie Archer, whose best throw was 13 
feet farther than any competitor, won the 
hammer throw with ease.

The Tritons tallied 207 points, giving 
them a comfortable win over second-
place Point Loma’s 157.5-point tally.

In the higher-profile invitationals 
coming up, Salerno said depth will be the 

key to success. 
“We’re going to try to get the 

people going that we’ll need to win the 
conference championship on the men’s 
side, and keep it on the women’s side,” 
he said. “We know who our stars are, 
but it’s going to be the fifth-, sixth- and 
seventh-[place] finishers that will make 
the difference.”

TRACK & FIELD — After being rained out of a 
meet at UC Irvine last weekend, the Triton track-
and-field teams were extra prepared to host the 
San Diego City Collegiate Championships on 
Mar. 6.

Both the men’s and women’s squads posted a 
slew of victories and broke two school records on 
what was a wildly successful day for the Tritons.

“We were ready to go last week, and getting 
cancelled was tough,” head coach Tony Salerno 
said. “We got some decent conditions today, and 
everyone did pretty well.”

San Diego State, Cal State San Marcos, Point 
Loma Nazarene University and the University 
of San Diego all participated in the meet. USD 
fielded only a women’s team. 

“It’s a pretty familiar group — almost a 

friends-and-family meet,” Salerno said. “It’s nice, 
early in the season, to have an intimate meet like 
this.”

On the men’s side, sophomore Nick Howe 
and senior Casey Ryan led the way, breaking 
their own school records in the javelin and high 
jump, respectively. Howe broke his record by 
over five feet with a throw of 206’3,” and Ryan, 
fresh off a season with the men’s basketball team, 
jumped 7’1” in his first meet of the year to set a 
new personal best and school record. Senior Fred 
Cook touched 179’ in the hammer throw, easily 
winning the event and posting a Division-II 
national qualifying mark.

The men finished in first place with 156 
points, and Point Loma came in second with 133 
points.

The Triton women were led by a trio of 
seniors who recorded national qualifying marks. 
Christine Merrill smashed the 400-meter hurdle 
competition in 59.82 seconds, won the 100-meter 
hurdles and ran on both the 4x100 and 4x400 
relay teams. Leah Murphy won the triple jump 

LUMBERJACK REVENGE

One week after a 35-point dismantaling of Humboldt State, UCSD is upset in conference semifinals.
By Liam Rose��  Senior Staff Writer

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — UCSD had 
every right to be confident coming into 
a Mar. 5 encounter with Humboldt State. 
The women were seeded No. 1 in the tour-
nament, and had beaten Humboldt mere 
days before.

However, the vengeful Lumberjacks 
took their shot at redemption — shoot-
ing with the confidence of a conference 

champion — and upset the Tritons 82-78, 
knocking them straight out of the CCAA 
tournament.

Five Lumberjack players scored double 
figures, and the team hit eight threes in 
the second half, powering Humboldt to an 
upset victory.

Senior guard Annette Ilg led the Tritons 
with 21 points and sophomore guard 

Chelsea Carlisle added 15 points, but 
their performances couldn’t offset a night 
of stellar shooting from the Lumberjacks, 
who redeemed themselves from a dreadful 
loss to UCSD only a week before: The 
Tritons won by 35 points on home court.

The Humboldt players shot over 50

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — Coming off a week 
of mixed results, the UCSD men’s volleyball 
team traveled north on March 5 to compete 
in a grueling battle against one of the most 
well-rounded teams in the conference: No. 2 
Stanford University. Unfortunately for UCSD, 
Stanford bettered the Tritons in three of four 
matches, with a final count of 30-18, 30-20, 
28-30, 30-20.

The loss dropped the Triton record to 
5-13 overall, 2-11 in Mountain Pacific Sports 

Federation play.
At the beginning of the match, Stanford 

quickly grabbed the lead, leaving UCSD to 
battle its way back. Against such a sturdy 
opponent, the challenge was too great for the 
Tritons.

Stanford started the first set by scoring 
five of the initial seven points. Though the 
Tritons took the lead after scoring eight of the 
next 10 points — senior opposite hitter Frank 
Fritsch’s kill marking the last Triton point — 
the Cardinal fought back to take the set 30-18.

The Cardinal carried on in winning form, 
easily winning the second set 30-20 and taking 

an early lead of 8-3 in the third.
“We got off to a poor start,” head coach 

Kevin Ring said. “We played well in game one, 
but Stanford kept getting great plays, so we fell 
behind. We knew we had to get off to a better, 
consistent start to win.”

However, UCSD pushed to make amends, 
tying the set 17-17 on a kill from junior 
middle-blocker Calvin Ross. Both teams 
were neck-and-neck until freshman middle-
blocker Cyrus Kiani’s kill won the set 30-28 
for UCSD.
