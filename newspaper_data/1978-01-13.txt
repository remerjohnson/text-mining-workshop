High ch.lorine count in . 
pool hurts six students 

by Steve Gould 
Several UCSD students 

uffered severe visual impair-
ment Tuesday and Wednesday 
due to excessively high chlorine 
content in the swimming pool 
the Triton Times has learned. 
Six students experienced 
burning and swelling in their 
eye and all required medical 
attention at the Student Health 
Center. 

Due to the heavy rains, water 
eeped into the electrical 

system of the Natatorium, 
shorting out the computer 
Which regulates the chlorine 
level and water temperature of 
the pool. Normally, the 
chlorine count varies between 
2.3 and 2.4 parts per million, but 
the mecbanical failure relulled 
in the level rilin. up to 15 parts 
per million or over six times the 
average (and "safe") level. 

Natatorium director Chuck 
Millenbah said "no human 
error was responsible," but 

that "this has happened before. 
We're thankful nobody was 
hurt seriously." 

Students warned 
One of the injured students, 

Kirk Long, a junior at Re~elle, 
told the Triton Times that 
Millenbah "had told us tbere 
was excessive chlorine and 
recommended we wear gog-
gles." But Long .and the five 
others swam in the pool and 
within 30 minutes felt strong 
burning_sensations in their eyes 
and. in three cases, swelling 
shut of the eyes. 

The students wt're treated at 
the Health Center by Dr. Z. 
Drescher Kripke, who later 
reported the incidents to 
Millenbab, suuestiha the pool 
be closed immediately. After 
closing the pool Tuesday 
evening to correct lighting 
problems, Millenbah reopened

Elephant variety threatened 
Does success mean doom for seal? 

. 

by Burney J. Le Doeuf 
Pacific News Service 

Birney Le Doeuf, professor of 
biology at the University of 
California in Santa Cruz, has 
written over 50 articles on 
elephant seal behavior. For the 
past ten years, he has conduct-
ed special university research 
projects at elephant seal 
colonies in California, Mexico 
and Argentina. A longer 
version of this article appeared 
in Pacific Discovery. 

While doze'n of marine 
species teeter on the brink of 
extinction, the remarkable 
return of the northern elephant 
seal to the Mexico-California 
coastline is often cited as one of 
the great wildlife success 
stories. 

Considered virtually extinct 
in 1890, these enormous seal 
mammals today number 
approximately 48,000 and are 
once alain breeding on islands 
spread over a I,OOO-mile range 
in the Pacific. 

But deapite their dramatic 
increase, it would be prema-
ture to conclude that elephant 
seals are safe and that the 
population is fit and viable. 

For though the elephant seal 
has recovered numerically, it 

has become genetically so 
impoverished that it may not be 
able to adapt to any drastic 
changes in its environment. 

Because of their gargantuan 
size elephant seals began to 
be exploited for their oil in 
the first decade of the 19th 
century and this continued at a 
rapid pace for about 40 years. 

Because the elephant seal is 
not afraid of man, it was easy 
prey for sealers, who killed 
seals of both sexe and all age 
indiscriminately . 

.. - ~ 

By the 1890s , scientists 
estimate, there may have been 
as few as 20 animals in the 
entire population, and probably 
no more than 100. this miniscule 
population thus constitutes the 
forebears of today 's entire 
species. 

In 1922, a joint American-
Mexican expedition to the Isla 
de Guadalupe reported finding 
264 elephant seals on the entire 
island . Judging that the 
population would agaill be 
exploited, the Mexican govern-

One of the last interviews with dead leader - Part One 
Steven Biko on black 'resistance in South Africa 
(CPS) - Steve Biko was the most 

important leader of opposition to the 
South AfricaD apartheid system of 
recent years. His organizing, until he 
was banned, aDd the powerful 
influence of his ideas, which reached 
all over the country, made bim feared 
by tbe Pretoria regime. Some 
gruesome details of his death at the 
age of 30 while beiDg interrogated by 
the Secret Police came out during the 
inquest into his death. 

He was kept naked in a cell for 19 
days, most of them in chains, and was 
taken naked and unconscious 750 miles 
in a jeep just before he died. His case 
has roused international attention, 
memorial meetings are being held all 
over the world and his ideas, 
expressed in the Black Consciousness 
ideology, are being carefully studied. 

This interview witb Steve Biko is one 
of the few firsthand recordings of his 
thoughts in the last years of his life. the 
tape of the interview has been 
circulating underground in South 
Africa. It was recently smuggled out. 
Because of its clandestine nature botb 
its origin and the identity of the 
interviewer are unknown. 

The tape begins with the conclusion 
of a statement by a third party. In 
response, Biko gives a history of black 
resistance in South Africa . 
- Dennis Brutus, exiled South African 

poet and professor of English, 
Northwestern University 

INT: _ What are tbe OrielDS of the 
Black ConsciousDess movemeDt? 

BIKO: The history starts off after 
1963~ . If you remember this era , 
there were many arrests i n this 
country which stemmed from 
underground activity by PAC (Pan 
Africanist Congress) , and ANC 
(African National Congress), 'and this 
led to some kind of political 
emasculation of the black population 
especially, with the result that there 
was no participation by blacks in the 
articulation of their own aspirations. 
The whole oppositon to what the 
government was doing to blacks 
came, in fact from white organiza-
tions , mainly student groups like 
NUSAS (Nationa l Union of South 
African Students) , the Liberal party 
and the Progressive party. 

When I came to university, some 
time ill 1966, in my own analYSis and 
that of my friends , there was some 
kind flf anomaly in this situation 
where w)1ites were, in fact, the main 
participants in our oppression and at 
the same time the main participants in 
the op'j>OSition to that oppression. The 
arena Nas controlled Li whites 'n what 
we called "totality of white power." 

We d!Ued that changes can come 
only as result of a program worked 
out by ack people. For black people 
to be ilble to work out a program they 
need to defeat the main element in 
politi cs working against them, a 
psychological feeling of inferiority, 
which was deliberately cultivated by 
the system. So, equally, the whites in 
order to be able to listen to the blacks 
needed to defeat the one problem they 
had. which was one oC superiority. 

( ' . the only way to come about his, 

of course, was to look anew at the 
black maD and what is leading him to 
denigration so easily . So first of all, we 
said black students could not 
participate in multi-racial organiza-
tions because of tbe overwhelming 
number of white students at 
university. Second, these organiza-
tions were concentrating mainly on 
problems affecting the white student 
community. And third , of course, 
when it came to political questions, 
they were far more articulate than the 
average black student because of their 
superior training, and because oftheir 
numbers they could outvote us on any 
issue. This meant that NUSAS gave 
political opinions that were largely 
affected by the whiteness of the 
a&:ganization. 

So in '68 we started forming what is 
now called SASO, the South Africans' 
Student Organization, which was 
firmly based on black consciousness, 
the essence of which was for the black 
man to elevate his own position by 

positively looking at those value 
systems that make him distinctively a 
man in society. 

INT: To what extent have you been 
successful? 

BIKO: To the extent that we have 
diminished the element of fear in the 
minds of black people. In the period oC 
'63 to '66, black people were terribly 
scared of involvement in politics. The 
universities were putting out no useful 
leadership to the black people , 
because everybody found it more 
comfortable to lose himself in a 
particular profession, to make money. 
But since those days, black students 
have seen their role as being primarily 
to prepare themselves for leadership 
roles in the various facets of the black 
community. 

There Is far more political talk now, 
far more political debate, and far 
more condemnation of the system 
from average black people than since 
1960 and possibly before. [' m referring 
to the oppressive educational system 
that the students are talking about. 
And (the) police , in (ace the 
government, wants to further 
entrench what the students are 

protesting about, by bringing police 
saracens, aDd dogs , and almost 
soldiers, so to speak. (Saracens are 
armored cars.) 

Now the response of the students 
tben was in terms of their pride. They 
were not prep-ared to be cowed even at 
the point of a gun, and hence, ~hat 
happened , happened. Some people 
were killed and these riots just 
continued and continued, because at 
no stage were the young students, nor 
for the. matter at some stage their 
parents, prepared to be scared. 

Everybody saw this as a deliberate 
act of oppression to try and cow the 
black masses . Everybody was 
determined equally to say to the 
police, to say to the government, "We 
shall not be scared by your police, by 
your dogs, and by your soldiers." Now, 
this kind of lack oC fear I see as a very 
important determinant in political 
action. 

INT: Since last June something like 
400 young blacks were killed ... 

BIKO: 499, actually. 
INT: 499 ••• And do you think this will 

not be a deterrent? 
BIKO: No . I think it has been a very 

useful weapon in merging the young 
and the old . BeCore then, there was 
obviously a difference in the outlook of 
the old generation to the younger 
generation: The younger generation 
was moviDg too fast for the old 
generation. The old generation was 
torn between Bantustan politics on the 
one side, old allegiances which were 
not progressive, you know, to groups 
like ANC, PAC, without any resultaDt 
action. And there were those who were 
simply too scared to move. 

INT: Do you condemn Bantustan 
leadersbip allOletlter/ 

BIKO: Yes, of course. We condemn 
Bantustan leaders, even the best of 
them, like Butelezi . 

INT: Well. jus, say a few words on 
that. 

BIKO: Our attitude here is that you 
cannot, in pursuing the aapiratioins of 
black people, operate from a platform 
which is meant Cor the oppression of 
the black people. Now we see all these 
so-called Bantustan platforms as 

being deliberate creations by the 
Nationalist government to contain the 
political aspirations of the black 
people and to give them pseudo 
political platforms to direct their 
attention to. Now, men like Butelezi, 
Mafanzima, Mangope and so on, are 
all participants in the white man's 
game of withholding the aspirations of 
the black people. 
. They are leading black people to a 

divided struggle struggle, to speak as 
Zulus, to speak as Xhosas, to speak as 
Pedis, which is a completely new 
Ceatur,e in political life of black people 
'in this-'country. 

We are oC the view that we should 
operate as one united whole towards 
a ttainment of an egalitarian society 
for the whole of Azama. And therefore 
any entrenchment of tribalistic. 
racialistic or any form of sectional 
outlook is abhorred by us. We hate it 
and we seek to destroy it. It is for this 
reason, therefore, that we cannot see 
any form of coalition with any of the 
Bantustan leaders, even the so-called 
best of them, because they destroy 
themselves by virtue of the kind of 
argument that tbey have put up. 

INT: Do you believe dlat by means 
of disturbances like the ODe iD Soweto 
you will bring about a real change of 
this society? 

BIKO: I see this as only one form of 
discontent. I'm of the view that the 
change process is going to be 
protracted. It depends entirely on tbe 
degree to which the Nationalist 
govennnent is prepared to hold 01) to 
power. My own analysis is that they 
want to hold on to power and fight with 
their backs to the wall. Now, conflict 
couid be avoidable only if they would 
be prepared to avoid it. Those who are 
at the seeking end, that is those who 
want justice, who want an egalitarian 
society, <;.an ,only pursue their 
aspirations according to the 
resistance offered by the opposi.tion . 

Now, I am a member of the Black 
Consciousness Movement. I was a 
member of BPe before I was banned, 
and now I have been , [ 'm told , 
appointed as honorary president of 
BPe (Black Political Congress). The 
line of the BPC is to explore, as much 
as possible, non-violent means within 
the country . That is why we exist. But 
there are people, and there are many 
people, who have despaired of the 
efficiency of non-violence as a method. 
They are of the view that the present 
nationalist government can be 
unseated only by people operating a 
military wing. 

I dOD't know if thjs i8 tbe final 
answer. In the end there i8 goln, to be 
a total effect of many agencies for 
change operatiDg in South Africa. I, 
personally, would like to see fewer 
,roups. I would like to see groups like 
ANC, PAC and the Black Conscious' 
nes MovemeDt decidin, &0 form one 
liberation group. It is only when black 
people are so dedicated and 10 united 
in their cause that we can effect the 
greatest result.

Abortion ••. 
(CODUDUed from page 1) 

"There's no reason it ThOUlhnotsureofwhatkind 
shouldn't be in the coverage," of student support there is for 
said Stoltz. "It's a nonnal part the three plaintiffs, Hunt said 
of health care that should be that only "two people have 
avail.able. It's not like anyone's come and spoken with me" (on 
forCing anyone to have an the anti-abortion side), leading 
abortion." 

Make otben piUy? 
Both Unstrot and Stoltz see 

the real issue as not being the 
mandatory $13 health fees, but 
that "these people have been 
trying to make others feel 
guilty about having abortions 
- calling abortions a dirty 
name." 

Though the women believe 
it's "common sense" to try to 
prevent conception, they are of 
the opinion that abortion should 
be seen as an alternative, 
"something that woman should 
decide for herself." 

The assertion of Linstrot, 
that "Nobody has the right to 
pick and choose what they'll 
pay into their reg fees, as 
anyone could object to where 
the money is going," is a 
similar point often made by 
Acting Vice-chancellor of 
Student Affairs Howard Hunt. 

Because of the impending 
court case, Hunt could not 
directly discuss the issue, but 
he did say that he felt "the 
principle of the mandatory fee 
has been upheld throughout the 
country and found cons.titu-
tional. .. 

Hunt said he is encouraged by 
one aspect of the court 
situation , that being the 
" students being allowed to get 
back in school," as he feels this 
is the most important thing ' 'for 
all concerned." 

him to observe, "00 we set the 
course of the university on the 
opinion of two students and 
ignore the other 9400?" 

"Reasonable levels" 
Htrnt believes that the 

situation "has been kept on 
reasonable levels," but is 
disturbed by what he sees as the 
issue being "so planned," 
allowing the university no real 
opportunity to discuss matters 
with, and seeing no motivation 
to talk with the university on 

the part of the plaintiffs . 
"We want the best student 

services for the fees," said 
Hunt. "If the students want to 
change the fee structure, they 
should have a referendum or go 
through the AS." 

Father Bernie Campbell of . 
the Office of .Religious Affairs 
sees the issue as more than 
fees , noting that within the 
university set-up there is "a 
gross misarrangement that 
will pay for abortions but won't 
pay for birth controls." 

Campbell considers the issue 
" a pretty clear injustice," and 
said, " I am in favor of what 
they've (the three plaintiffs) 
have done ." He also noted a 
" general support' among 
members of th e Catholic 
Students Union over the actions 
taken by the three. 

" One cannot say, given the 
::omplexity of our society, that 

Frida"......" 13, 1171 

no abortions should be done," 
said Campbell, "but it is wrong 
to make it a condition of 
enrollment to a public universi-
ty." 

Campbell also has severe 
objections to the frequency of 
abortion on campus, prompting 
him to say, "We're not talking 
about exceptional situations. 
U's almost a casual practice, 
and I think this is wrong." 

Pool ••. 
(Continued from pale 1) 
students required treatment (a 
wash solution and eye drops 
were used to correct the 
injuries), with Long being held 
for observation over two hours. 

Shuatlon corrected 
Millenbah noted that "the 

pool will be back to normal by 3 
pm (Wednesday)" and re-
opened Thursday morning. The 
$20,000 computer system which 
regulates the pool's servicing 
was reportedly repaired by two 
UCSD maintenance engineers .

LP CONSUMER GUIDE 
-by Ted Burke 

The holidays were inundated with new albums, some given as 
gifts, some act of faith purchases, some free from the record 
companies . As happens often, one is pressed to say anything in 
depth about them, but there remains still a burning need -
revenge? - to not let the discs· pass without comment. The 
following are quick comments that hopefully get to the meat of 
the matter without too much fanfare or folly. 

In City Dreams - Robin Trower 
Trower's delve into soulful balladry is hardly the best he can 

do. One song, "Sweet Wine of Love", is a gorgeous blend of Ray 
Charles and Tony Bennett, with an exquisitely phrased vocal by 
Jim Dewar. Other than that, the tracks tend to melt together 
like slabs of butter, becoming an unseemly, over-enriched goo.

EnIgmatic Ocean - Jean Luc Ponty 
Despite the presence of the brillant Allan Holdsworth on 

guitar, Ponty's newest U; yet another dramaturgical trek 
through melodious, tight and generally stale jazz rock. His 
violin work remains superb, but considering the context, it's 
just another touch of velvet in ofC-the-rack rock readymades. C. 
Expres80 - Gong 

Guitarist Allan Holdsworth is featured here again in a much 
bette r environment. His solos , graceful expositions of 
technique, speed and intelligence, are a constant joy here. The 
band touches upon the classics and jazz rock, but they don't 
strive to sla vish Iy adhere to them. Rather, other musical modes 
are used, expanding the vocabulary of " progressive" rock well 
beyond what one would expect. A thoughtful, masterfully 
eclectic a~bum by a band that wisely sidesteps the impulse to 
implement a tour-de-force. A. 
Mongrel - Bob Seger System 

Recently re-released by Capitol, this 1969 Seger session 
shows him in his scuffling days. The music is sharper, tougher 
and more vicious in attitude, and Seger's lyrics are the 
fore runner of the "fuck you" surrealism that New Wave bands 
favor these days . Also, Seger's voice has enough power in it to 
fue l an ICBM to Russia. Two classic cuts, " Teachin ' Blues" and 
"Lucifer", are fantastic rockers that succinctly summerize 
what one may call the punk ethic: Live fast, die young, and have 
fun in the process. A minus. (Please turn to page 7)

powerful performances both in 
the United States and abroad.

to contend with on the inter-
national virtuoso level." And 
the New York Post commented 
on " the beauty of Roge 's 
strong, vibrant playing with its 
subtle nuances." 

Mr. Roge has toured through-
out North America and made

Although the Tritons barley 
held on to win, 73~ , there were 
over sixty turnovers in all with 
passes flying everywhere but 
on the playing surface. 

The Tritons got off to an early 
lead as freshman fgrward Al 
Jacobs was able to score ·from 
the outside. This forced the 
Marines to come out of their 
zone defense and opened up the 

iddle for some smart drives 
the basket by the Tritons . 

half closed with the Tritons 
by six, 41-35 . 

In the early part of the second 
half, it looked as if the Tritons 
would blow the Marines out of 
the gym. They were ahead by

Braxton, who has a tendency to . 
obfuscate his ideas into an 
intellectual concept that unifies 
the progression of music on an 
international scale (a forced 
marriage between Schonberg 
and Coltrane at times, best 
typified on bis Five Pieces

critics do the homework. and 
just play for the sheer jqy of it.

and richly textured, at times 
stridE)nt and jarring in their 
tonal colors, to unnerviDgly 
sedate passages. Tbe soloists, 
particularly Dewy Redman

sax) and Eddie Henderson 
(trumpet) give tboughtful 
performances, avoiding dire 
seriousness , ebuliant note

Elephant seals threatene.d ... 
(Continued from page 1) 
ment granted the species 
immediate and complete 
protection. 

When animals began to 
appear off the coast of southern 
California, the U.S. govern-
ment followed the example of 
Mexico and granted the species 
protection. 

By 1957 researchers estimat-
ed a total population of 13,000 
seals, and within the past 20 
years that figure has more than 
tripled. 

R ece nt d ata, however , 
strongly suggest that the 
extreme population reduction 
of the northern elephant seal in 
the 19th century has left the 
current population with little 
ability to adapt to its environ-
ment. 

When blood samples were 
collected recently from 125 

seals at five different rooker-
ies , the analysis showed a 
startling result. In the labora-
tory the 125 seals looked like 
siblings from the same 
fertilized egg. 

All the blood samples had the 
same genetic structure . No 
polymorphisms (different 
genetic forms) were found in 
the entire elephant seal 
sample. And polymorphisms 
are important indicators of how 
well a population can adapt to 
environmental changes . 

This genetic weakening 
started last century, when , 
nearing extinction, the seals 
were able to breed only with 
closely related individuals . 
Severe inbreeding can lead to a 
condition .. inbreeding depres-
sion" - characterized by loss 

of fertility , growth anomalies 

What can we really expect ... 
(Continued from page 3) 

But can the AS wrest that type of power from the 
administration? This would require greater student involvement 
and support. A student government that could truthfully say it 
represents most of its constituency would lay claim to some real 
clout with the administration. But most students consider student 
government ineffective, and so not worth the time. 

Student government appears to be caught in a vicious Catch-22 
cycle. In order for it to gain more power, it needs to show the 
administration it has strong student support. But most students 
will consider it just a joke, until they see that it has a more direct 

infl!l~nce on their lives.

and metabolic disturbances. 
Another cause of inbreeditlg 

is that male elephant seals are 
extremely polygamous; a few 
males do most of the mating. 
For example, one male may 
inseminate all of the females in 
a harem of 100 or more, and he 
may monopolize breeding in 
this way for four or more breed-
ing seasons, father-daughter 
matings begin to occur after a 
male has been dominant for 
four years in a row . If he 
dominates for seven consecu-
tive years, father-granddaugh-
ter matings would occur in the 
last year. 

One possitHe effect of 
inbreeding and genetic weak-
ening could be the inability of 
the elephant seal to adjust to 
drastic changes in its diet. It is 
believed that the seal feeds 
primarily on a single food such 
as squid. But if the squid supply 
were suddenly depleted, the 
elephant seal population could 
collapse for lack of food 
because it may not have the 
genetic capability to switch to
