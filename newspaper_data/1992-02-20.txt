SAE ApoIngIzes to 
IFC, Panhellenic 
ForC,iticized Flyer 
• No official action taken by university; 
issue may go to Interfraternity Council 
judicial board, leadership coordinator says 
By PhIlp MlchaI'1 

St8"~er 
In the wake of objections 

from the Women's Resource 
Center (WRC) to a fraternity 
calendar of events, members of 
Sigma AJpha Epsilon apologized 
to the Interfraternity Council 
(lFC)and the Panhellenic Coun-
cil at a meeting Tuesday night. 

Representatives from SAE 
also met with Paul DeWine, lead-
ership development coordinator 
for University Events and Stu-
dent Activities, to discuss the 
Oyer which received criticism 
for containing what some con-
sideredsexist images of women. 

SteveAger,JRSidentofSAE, 
said that the fraternity apolo-
gized to the rest of the Greek 
system for any negative public-
ity caused by the incident. 

SAE also apologized to any-
body offended by the c:onIenI of 
the 

"We will look at our attitudes 
to..see if we hold any which are 
dangerous and insensitive to 
women," Ager said. 

Aget added that he will at-
tend tomorrow's WRCmeeting 
to discuss the calendar of events 
and SAE's behavior in this inci-
dent. 

"We will give [the WRC] the 
opportunity to help us see if we 
have thcIe lltitudes, " he said. 

AprsugeseedlhalSAEmay 

plan an event in conjunction with 
the WRC to raise the fraternity' 
awareness of its attitudes towards 
women. SAE will also attend a 
date rape seminar next quaner. 

According to DeWine, no 
action has been taken against 
SAE by the university or IFC. 

"The situation will be re-
viewed on whether or not it will 
be sent to the IFC judicial board," 
DeWine said. 

Ager said he believes that no 
charges will be brought against 
SAE for the flyer incident. 

"We didn't violate any spe-
cific rules, we didn't mean for it 
to be public, we apologized to 
the IFC, and we apologized to 
the WRC," Agersaid. 

"And really, what more can 
we do?" he added. 

According to WRC member 
Molly McKay. the fact that no 
serious action wiD be laken ern-
phasizes a probJem with enforc-
ing student organization behav-
ior. 

"It's problematic that one stu-
dent organization had to respond 
to another in this situation. The 
WRC is only a club. We don't 
have the resources to deal with 
the probIem," McKay said. 

She added. "A [university-
fwldcd) Women's Center could 
have put more pressure on the 
IFC."

Protestors rallied outside of UGL last night before entering the library 
for the night to protest the rising cost of higher education. 

Demonstrators Stage 
Fee Protest in UGL 
• Students spend the night in Undergraduate Library, 
agree to conditions for limited access to building 
By Mary Betty Heard 
News Editor 

A group of approximately 25 student occupied the Undergraduate 
Library (UGL) yesterday in protest of the latest rise in student fees. 

The students began their "Study-In" with a noon rally, then moved to 
UGL, where they remained for the rest of the day. At around 9: 15 p.m., a 
group of the protestors left the library for a torchlight march around campus 
chanting "Education is a right: no fee hikes," and returned to the library at 
approximately 10:45 p.m. 

When the marchers returned, they fonned a group to chant for two local 
television stations, holding six torches, signs and a banner reading, "Fight

UCB Attempts to Get Pub Renovation on Track 
BIDDING FOR TRITON PUB ALTERATIONS • Administration refuses lowest bidders, citing 

improper procedure; Pub may open next fall 
By ErIc Sct.mldt 
Associate News Editor 

University architects offered University Center Board (UCB) mem-
bersanumberofoptions yesterday which would lower the unforeseen high 
costs of the Triton Pub renovation. 

1bc meeting with the architects followed an administrative statement 
that the two lowest bids on the pub renovation would be turned down 
because of alleged improprieties. Before being disqualified. the lowest bid 
was over $40,000 greater than the $242,000 originally predicted by the 
UCB. 

Because of the disqualiflC8lion, the current low bid is at $348,000, 
according to UCSD Director of Architecture and Project Management 
Robert Wielaae. 

Wielage said the next step in the renovation will be to ask the project 
architects to redraw their plans with a number of new options which would 
cut costs by about $60,000. 

UCB Vice 0Wr Erik Swanholt had no problems with the suggested 
cutbacks. .. It seems like some of the systems [in the previous plan) were 
super«luxe," he said. "We definitely don 't want a shoddy renovation,but 
we don't want high-tech." 

Swanholl noted that the atmosphere of the student center precludes a 
hish-fech pub atIIIOSpheIe. 

WaeJaae said the pub could be open by Fall Quaner 1992 following a 
six- toeip&.week bidding process. Swanholt said the project may be ready 
by then, but he cannoc be sure since the pub renovation was first scheduled 
to be compleled Jut fall. 

1be Ihina that '!II frustratina riaht now is just that it's taken a long time," 
said SWIIIhoIt, who hopes to be able 10 patronize the pub ~ he

Uterature DePartment to Offer 
ClaSson LesblanjGayWritings 
By Fraltellco DeV .... 
StMfWriter 

The UCSD Literature Depanment is cur-
rently regiSlering students into a new cJ.s 
thal focuses on the contributions of gay and 
lesbian writers. The class, titled "Literaturel 
English ISO - Gender Text and Culture, 
Lesbian,(iay Literature," has been in the 
planning Slap since last year and is the first 
of its kind in the Litenuure Department. 

Last year, Professor Judith Halbers1am 
was hiaed by the Literature Depar1ment, 
panially for her experience and knowledge 
in the field of gay and lesbian literature, in 
hopes that she would teach a class special-
izing on the subject. 

According to Halberstam, ''The liternture 
department is interested indcvelopingcourses 
in gay and lesbian studies and they have 
encouraged me to teach [such a class]." 

Halberstam said he feels that the class is 
an imponant addition to the university. ''The 
goals of this course are to give gay, lesbian 
and heterosexual students .. . access to a body 
of WOB: that they may not otherwise have 
access to," she said. 

Chandan Reddy, the internal affairs di-
rector of the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual 
Association (LGBA), said he is also excited 
about the class. "The class stans to sponsor. 
within students on this campus. this idea that 
lesbian and gay people have been in litern-
ture since English Literature really was tak-

ing off," he said 
Reddy said he also feels that the class is an 

imponant addition to the university. He said 
that the class is "entirely necessary." 

''There are so many people who want to 
learn about it. Lcsbian/Gay theory is one of 
the most recent scholarly subjects in this 
nation," Reddy said. 

Halberstam was particularly concerned 
with attracting heterosexual students to the 
class, IL'I well as gay and lesbian students. 
She commented that ~it is a class that hetero-
sexual students may also be interested in 
because it is about the construction of sexu-
ality; it is DOl simply about gay and lesbian 
experience ... 

She went on to explain that the develop-
ment of this class "is a response to a diversi-
fication of university curricula in genernl. 
We see diversity in the clirection of elhnic 
studies. This is kindof adiversification in the 
direction of sexual minorities." 

Reddy and Halbersmm both expect a 
large turnout. Reddy said, "I think the 
response 10 this class is going to be over-
whelming. It is ju t going to make more and 
more people realize, administrators and pro-
fessors particularly, how many classes in all 
the fields of academia, .. need to stan having 
lesbian/gay classes." 

Halberstam shared his intelpretation. She 
said the class was formed "in response 10 a

the aIministralion. 

Now, though UCB Clair Molly McKay 's board is much more 
outSpOken on !he subject of srude.tt issues, its VOles seem 10 be 
completely ignon:d by the administration. 

This is not to say thal the UCB shouldn't promoIC srude.tt ~ 
including the plight of UCSO' srudent cooperatives. But perhaps the 
board, led by McKay, has been so aggn:ssive that it has turned off every

ofstudenl foes, and should be cootrolled by students. But IhewUortunaIe 
truth is that the administration has a srranglehold on most every aspect 
of swdcnIlife, including the UCB's money. 

If, through legal means. the UCB can prove !hal it should have a say 
in how Ihe university cenreris run and how Ihe UCB budget is spent, then 
more power to it B .. if that doesn't happen - and it's certainly a good 
possibility that it woo't - then !he UCB will have 00ne noching but

one of Ihe studms' most irnportn and influertial voices. 

Anocherquestion about the UC8 - one which is especiaIJy ~­
tan! if !he board does gain Jeverage in dealing with !headministrarion-
is its composition. Cunaltly, no member of the UCB is eIectrd dinx:tly 
by studeIts. Members are appointed by various studert organiz.aliom, 
and the UCB chair is approved by a v()(Cofboard members. In pest years, 
the UCB chair has been diru:tly elected. But 10 allow graduaIe studerts 
to be eligible for the posilion.!he election NIcs ~ aJtemj .. year. 

This procedure must be cIw1ged. A special graduate studm election

FRATERNITY CALENDAR CONTROVERSY 

Another Black Eye for Greeks 
When !he Inter-Fralemiry Council (IFC) punished Siama Alpba 

Epsilon (SAE) fraternity for .. offensive flyer it circulated last year, 
it seemed that SAE had Ieamcd its lesson. Fl'Ifemity members evco 
took p.n in a "sensitivity wcxbhop." 

As lheoffensiveSAEcalendarpublished in Monday'sGIIQ/'diQn 
shows, the fratemity'sre-educationdoesn't seem 10 have liken. The 
graphic depiction of a woman willl a mouIh and teeth where her 
vll8ina should be was dispstinganliderneaning. Fraternity officials 
claim that the caJendv wasn't for public consumption. 

Nice try. But sexism behind closed doors is sliD sexism. 0bvi-
ously SAE has anempted to keep its sexism away from public view, 
but someone obviously felt enough of the flyer to send it to the 
Women's Resource Center. 

For SAE, it's yet another black eye. For UCSO's greek sySlem, 
it's yet another setback for a group of organizations that seem to 
bend over backward trying to improve their public image. 

Going through the motions of attending a sensitivity workshop 
isn't going to change members of SAE or any other fralemiry. We 
must all wait until they choose to give up their sophomoric, 
neandenhalic views of women ... if they ever do.

A·Unive Sign of_ 
Student Was Misinfonned 
Editor: 

This letter is a response to the student's 
letter (Feb. 13) about the Guardian's 
photograph of two gay men kissing each 
other. 

1be student stated that "a college 
education is supposed to be ... tuming 
America's yOUth into thinking participants 
of society." Furthennore. the student 
realized that returning "to a culture which is 
based on sound, time-tested moral prin-
ciples" gives bener reassurance than "a 
professor or department's twisted political 
agenda." 

Well, our direct answer to that student is 
illooks like you rnight need to go back to 
the professor or department you refer to 
because someone there might be able to 
explain to you that your own moral 
principles are no Janger generally accepted 
by everyone. 

We are ordinaJypeople. We are

In the Feb. 10 issue of

Homosexuality Is 
''TIme-HonoI8d' 
I'AHtor: 
, I do no( make a habit of addressing those 
'who are either 100 afraid or too ashamed to 
mike lheir identities known.. but, as a 
radonal individual who is not homosexual 
and n:spccts the rights of all humanity,l 
feel obligated to reply to the hateful. 
lIIOftymous \etter regarding homosexuality 
and Valerline' s Day. 

The author speaks of the time-honored 
tradition and anctimony of Valentine's. 
However, as Greek an depicts the free 
expression of homosexuality as early as the 
sixth century B,C .• and SI. Valentine did 
not die until 269 A.O., one must wonder 
which of the two time has honored more. 
Furthermore, as Valentine's Day originated 
as a pagan festival of the British Isles, it 
seems unfounded to cite it as the corner-
stone of American values. 

It seems to me, the author feels the 
Guardian's expose will make Valentine's 
Day a "gay" holiday, thereby threatening 
his/herown sexuality. One would be 
ignorant to think that before the Guardian's 
photograph, homosexuals had not partici-
pated in Valentine's Oay. 

Also unwarranted is the author's fear 
thaI he/she will, one day, be accidentally 
anally intruded. Unlike tripping on a curb 
or spilling a glass of water, this is not an act 
that occurs by chance or without the 
knowledge of both parties. It should also be 
noted t)lat anal sex is not the stock and 
trade of the homosexual community. 

Finally, if the author is concerned about 
being accosted with images of homosexual-
ity,l suggest he/she think twice before 
leaving the house.

A Gay YalerJtile's Day 
Editor: 

In an effon to increase visibility, let me 
describe my Gay Valentine's Day. It started 
late as my special someone is a member of 
one of the sports teams here on campus, and 
his practice/competition schedule kept him 
on campus longer than he expected. As it ' 
turns oat. he actually spent the whole day 
cooking. When I arrived at his place, an 
amazing meal was set out on the table with 
fresh-cut flowers as a centerpiece. We had a 
greal dinner and an even better dessen. 

Afteawards we went dancing and met up 
with some of our friends. We ended the 
night at a nearby cafe, laughing about the 
ignorant letter printed in the Guardian the 
day before. Revelling in our "shameful 
lifestyle," "Iimp-wristed" and "lisping" we 
concluded that the lener's author was 
actually some silly freslunan with a bad 

haircut and a J. Crew cata log stuffed under 
his mattress for secret midnight browsing. 

My Valentine and I retumed to his place 
and passionately engaged in acts that 
would get even straight people into Hell. 
But we did it sweetly, safely, and with deep 
affection, Does any of this sound familiar, 
or is everyone as shocked as Miss Rabid 
Hate-Monger? 

Gay visibility is increasing on TV, in 
the movies. in your neighborhood. even, 
finally, right here on campus. Po itive gay 
images are popping up everywhere - not 
because of some radical underground 
movement, but because people everywhere 
are growing tired of hatred, tired of 
ignorance, and tired of the "moral minor-
ity" shouting fire and brimstone anytime 
someone embraces an altemative. 

Dave Mills 

PrejJdice is Never Funny 
Editor: 

The author of the letter, hiding behind the 
cloak of anonymity, vented such vituperative 
and rabid sentiment that it was almost laugh-
able. But in actuality,there is nothing funny 
about the prejudice and bigotry of extremists 
like this-they are dangerous and deadly 
serious. 

- For example, in December, just three 
months after Governor Wilson vetoed legis-
lation which would have protected gays and 
lesbians from discrimination, a 17-year-old 
San Diego boy was attacked, savagely beaten, 
and stabbed to death by a gang of skinheads 
spootlng the same anti-gay hatred that was 
expressed in the Guardian letter. 

The young man, John Roben Wear, was 
the 52ndvictim in a series of unsolved violent 
crimes directed against gays and lesbians in 
San Oiego in recent months, all of which went 
sadly unmentioned by the Guardian, lnstead 
of an article denouncing the recent wave of 
"hate crimes," the Guardian offered a com-
mentary urging us to pmtect"the right to hate 
others" (Jan. 9). 

We should never deny anyone's right to 
express their beliefs. But while we can only 
pity the small-minded cowards who exercise 
their right to hate, we should respect and 
admire those with the courage to exercise 
their right to love.

But even with the myths ac-
knowledged, VA majors symbolize 
a notion that other majors envy: the 
notion of studying a field for per-
sonal, not monetary gain. Unlike 
other students who choose majors 
based on salary prospects, most V A 
majors haven't "sold out" theirshort 
stay at UCSD. 

When a person "bashes" VA ma-
jors in the fonn of jokes or ligtx ridi-

with their choice of major. Or it could 
be a; simple IL<; having a dc:cp-rooted

Writers such as Joan Nestle, the 
author of A Restricted Country and 
co-founder of the Ie bian archives

upcoming book on Gothic mon-
sters, titled Ptrvtrts and Parasitts.

• "...... 1\vo weeks 
of rain-outs could slow 
Tritons' momentum 
., ....... 
GunIIn Repotter 

Beleapnd by six consecutive 
rain-ou1s over the pili two weeks, 
the Triron _ebIU laID is strug-
gling to keep it's rnommlum gained 
after pumrnclins the Pomona Pitzer 
Sagdlem nearly two weeks ago in 
Pomona. 

With doubleheaders against 
Quist CoUege of Irvine on Friday 
and Biola University on Saturday, 
UCSO (2~) can only hope the ex-
tended wait has not soiled its offen-
ive Ihrea1. which has amassed 44 

base hits and 35 runs in two games. 
Centerfielder Ernie Isola feels 

the break from action has stolen 
some of the Triton momentum, but 
has hun their competitors as well. 
"We scored a 101 of run [against 
Pomona)," noted Isola. "We've 
missed a lot of practice since, but so 
has everybody else. We're all on a 
pretty even keel." 

Coach Yates is counting on Brent Hansen to lead UCSD this weekend. 

Junior Steve Wrenn has also felt 
lhe effect of the lay-off. "We 
haven't had much of a chance to be 
outon theflCld,soI'mjusthappyto 
be out playing," the leftfielder said. 
"It's kind of like starting the season 
over again." 

The Triton ' line·up has stayed 
healthy and they should be at full-
strenghth thjs weekend. 

They almost had to play lasl 
weekend without first baseman 
David Rex, who was busy collect~ 
ing $50,(0) on The Big Spin. The 

game was rained out and the senior 
AJI-American will be ready to play 
this Friday. 

Rex, who launched 19 home runs 
last season while playing at San 
Bernadino, pearheads the potent 
Triton attack fromtheclean.upspot. 

Another question raised by the 
two-week lay-offconcerns the pilCh-
ing rotation. 

The staff will be well rested for 
the two doubleheaders this week-
end, yet the lack of recent innings 
may be a problem for this veteran 
staff. 

Righthander Bryan Thomason 
is confKlenl thai the rain~ts will 
not plague the rotation. "We'll aU be 

UCSD SUPERSTARS 
Record Summar •• (1.76-1.11) 

well-rested," the senior hurler as-
ured. 

Coach Lyle Yates will haveallof 
hisstanersathisdisposal thi week-
end. 

Brent Hansen and Ryan Aanagan 
are the pro pective staners for 
Friday's twin bill in Irvine. while 
Thomason and Denny Kubinski are 
pencilled in for Saturday. 

UCSD's doubleheader against 
Christ College of Irvine is a make-
up from Tuesday's raiJH:ancelled 
contest. 

The Tritons will host Biola Uni-
versity at noon on Saturday. 

The game will be UCSD's first 
home game of the season.

Although, defending champion Tim Andre (5901 points in 1991) has completed his eIigibiity and 
moved onto more noble pursui1a,lhis year's competition should be one of the moat c:ornpetitMI_. 

Sasaki (5633 points) and Balderston (5585) finished 2-3 in last year's IMnI and both will be

Women's Basketball 
Takes Fifth In a Row 
By GNG W,.... 

I AssociBte Sports Editor 
After five big wins in a row, the 

UCSD women's basketball team is 
finally putting together the kind of 
games Head Coach Judy Malone 
knew her team was capable of back 
in I'.)ecember. Trouble is, it's just a 
little laic. With only two games re-
maining on the schedule, the Tri-
tons' hopes of continuing on to post- -
season play, even if they win their 
last two games, are not very bright. 

That fact didn't stop the Tritons 
on Tuesday night though as they 
traveled to Occidental College and 
tamed the Tigers 85-62. 

"We just played really well," 
said Malone. "Everything worked 
perfectly and 00 matter what they 
threw at us, we just kept pouring the 
points in." 

Carl Young led UCSD, picking 
up21 points whileLisa Beaver Ihrew 
in l3 of her own. 

The Tritons looked to Beaver 
exclusively during the opening 
moments oftbe game. "They came 
out in a zone defense, and we were 
able to get it inside to Lisa at will," 
said Malone. It was Beaver who 
picked up UCSO' s fll'St four baskets 
of the game. 

Even after they adjusted to Bea-
Vel inside, the Tigers were power-
less to Slop the runal"ay Tritons. 
UCSDwashiningfromeverywhere 
on the floor, am was up 22-4 just 
four minUleS into the game. 

"They weretrying everything-
IIIIIHO-maD, zooe, press- and we 
just kept scoring," explained 
Malone. 

Malone was especially pleased 
with the way her team ran the floor. 
UCSD capitalized on a 48-21 ~ 

bounding edge to lUll the fast break, 
"We were able to run the break 
because they were slower and 
couldn't get back, so we took ad-
vantage of that," said Malone. 

The Tritons headed into the half-
time break. wima52-2.51ead. a score 
built with 59 percent shooting from 
the floor in the half. 

Defensively, the Tritons stuck 
with a tight man-to-man that limited 
Occidental to a meager 31 percent 
field-goal rate in the first half. As a 
result of that tight defense, the Tri-
tons finished with ten steals, five of 
them from point guard Kathleen 
Alvarez. 

The second half sawall of 
UCSD's starters sit down by the 13 
minute mark and not return. "We 
played everybody on the bench, es-
pecially in the second half. It was 
good to see them all get out there 
and play so well for us," said Malone. 

Alison Cartwright had her best 
game of the season, coming off of 
the bench for UCSD. 

Taking over the three-man posi-
tion, Cartwright was four for six 
from the field and two for two from 
the free throw line, giving her ten 
points for the night. In addition, she 
collected five rebounds for the Tri-
ton cause. 

Free throw shooting was yet an-
other bright spot for the Tritons. 
UCSD, normally a SO percent shoot-
ing team, nailed ten oftwelvC: "Even 
our free throw shooting was great, it 
was like a miracle," said Malone. 

As the season draws to a close, 
Malone has nothing but praise for 
htI team. "We played really well. 
These an: the games I expected us to 
win, but the way we've been win-
ning 10 big has been • surprise."

himself as a legitimate 1eader in San

"I understand what San Diego is 
all aboul, and whal it takes," 
Marshall said. 

"There's only a handful of

Marshall has led UCSD 10 a 63-
J 5 overall record in the past three 

years. The wins include three trips 
10 the NCAA Division m playoffs 
in as INDy years. 

MarshalJ said he milhtevenccn-

Chances are, however, Ihat 
Tarkanian, or whoever else came in

Marshalliecls that he wouldn't

Dianna Moreno dido't boIber

But the pilChing wuonly one of the 
weapons in the Triton arsenal on 
Tuesday. The nightcap featured the 
Triton bets steamroIJing the BuD-
dogs 8-1. 

Moreno, All-American and the 
Tritons' all-time leaderin ERA. was 
simply untouchable dvough the first 
four innings before Redlands' Julie 
Ingle managed to poke one down 
the rightflCld line. Ingle made it to 
second. but she would be the only 
Bulldog to make it that f •.

the offaIIe turned CIUllO be as pow-
erfuI.the ....... 

UCSO epin hid seven hilS, but 
it was the maianer in which they 
were collected off of Redlands 
pitcher Michelle Phillipllhlll most 
irnpn:ssed Triton Head Coach Mel-
issa Jamll. "We hit !he ball when 
we needed to. I was real glad about 
that because I knew we should be 
able to hit this pitcher." 

Offensively, the Tritons started 
their scoring off when Moreno 
singled in the second iming. 

After Kerri Carter failed to reach 
base,leadoffhilter Melissa Mazanet 
got to first on a walk. ThaI brou&ht 
up Lisa Mona. who got anothersingle 
and Moreno trotted home with the 
fmt run. 

Things didn't start off thai great 
for UCSO. With Lacie Mounger on 
the mofand, the Bulldop wasted 
little time in scoring. The first in-
ning saw Redlands' Phillips get to 
first on a Triton error. She quickly 
stole sccond and made it home when 
Ingle connected on a double. But 
the BuUdop would be tnbIe 10 do 
more, despi1e picking up four more 
hits. 

Dianna Moreno pitched 8 on&hlt shutout as UCSO notched • 3-(}wtn. 

UCSO didn't wait much tonser 
to increase the lead. 

The third iMing saw one of 
UCSO's six freshmen, Theresa 
Zuniga. get on with the help of an 
enor in centerfield. Another eoor, 

The Tritons evened !he score in 
the thinl when Theraa SwickJa 
scored on a Mazanet sin&Je. 

Then came the sixth iming, and 
the UCSO bats exploded. Seven 
runs would cross the plaIe before 
the befuddled Bulldogs could get 

out of the inning. 
St.tilll the hit parade off for the 

Tritons was Kerri Caner. After her 
score, came Mora. Usa Gil, Rubin, 
Booth, Moreno and Swickla again. 

Coach JarreD was relieved to 
open the ICI80Il on a positive nore. 
"I don 'f know when the lasI year we 
won our opener was. It's hard to 
start the season wiIb a loa. so this

Jarrell was also pleased with the 
performance put on by the young 
team which has only two seniors

Bungee-Jllllping, 
7·11 and Roy 
J usr A Fe'W NO'ru: • So UCSD men' basketball Head Coach 
Tom Marshall has put his hat -
and head and neck - into the 
Shark's tank. Why not? 

The UCSD athletic program i 
loaded with first-class coache 
porting first-rate credentials. But 

Marshall may be at the head of the 
class. Just look at what the Trilon 
have accomplished this year: a 16-
game win streak, a 21-4 record 
and a No. 3 ranking in the latest 
NCAA Division or polls. 

Mind you. thi is a team that 
1051 three staners from the 1991 
squad: All-American Tim Rapp, 
Tom Shawcroft and Gordon 
McNeill. All that group did was 
set a school record for wins. pick 
up the program' first NCAA 
tournament victory and raise 
expectations to the point that the 
1992 squad, sans Ihn:e major cog 
in the engine, might as well have 
gone bungee-jumping without the 
cord. Sman money had the 
Tritons spiraling out of the clouds 
right smack into mediocrity. 

Sman money is now someone 
else's money. 

W JIIL£ llIE performance of players like John Spence 
and Ouis Moore - both of whom 
have plugged gaping holes - have 
helped immensely, the conmon link 
in die ~ of the last three 
seasoos has been Marshall. 

He has succeeded in achieving 
the two major goals of any coIle-
giale coach: consistenc wins and a 
seIf-rejuvcnaring program. Without 
question, Marshall has shown that 
he can build a college program. 

And basketball at any level is 
slill basketball. Granted. in 
Division I the players are a little 
faster, a little bigger, and they 
make more money. But the game 
is still block out, play defense and 
put the ball through the net. 

Why shouldn't Marshall get his 
shot aldie big time? He hIL'i always 
been one of the classiest and 
hanIest-worting ooaches on campus 
- from his dealings with his 
players 10 his deaIinp with the 
media. The next step is a move up. 

R EAUSTlCALL Y, HOWEVER, MarshaIJ doesn'l have a 
dwIce. By IOSSing his hat inIO the 
SDSU circus, he's jl.mped inIO a

Anyone who saw UCSD' 
trouncing of Pacific Christian 
College on Tuesday night might 
be surprised to find OUI that the 
Royalsare aplay-offbound team. 

With an overall n:cord of 20-
16. Pacific Christian is one of the 
top teams in the Conference -
the Small College Conference 
that is. 

Now against schools with en-
rollments that are smaller than 
rnosI high schools. the Royals 
aren't a bad squad, but against 
Division ill powemouse UCSD, 
Pacific Ouistian was little more 
than another notch in the Triton 
win column. 

The Tritons had little b'OUble. 
in the conIeSt as they coasted to a 
97-46 victory to increase their 
current win strcalc to 16 games, 
the longest in UCSD history. 

UCSD, now 21-4 overall and 
ranked third nationally in Divi-
sion m. led from the opening tip • 
and never looked back. 

With an early run that included 
an excellent blend of inside and 
outside shooting, the Tritons ran 
off 14 unanswCRd points and 
scored with evCl)'lhing from a 
Dervin Jackson coasl-lO-Coast 
drive, to an Eric Johnson three-
pointer. 

Meanwhile, the Royals were 
having serious offensive diffi-
culties.
