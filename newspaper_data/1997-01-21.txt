"The student regent has heen invited occa-

Acwrding to Bravin, the chairman of the

Brophy said the UCSA's resolulion would 
not carry much weight with the regents . 

"They' re ask ing that at a very bad time, 
considering our experience with Ihe last two

Regents Appoint New CFO to Manage Hospitals' Books 
OVERSIGHT: Alksne 
says Sakai will prevent 
another $20-milJion 10 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

SAN FRANCISCO - The UC 
Board of Regents last Friday ap-
pointed David Sakai the new ch ief 
financial officerofUCSD's troubled 
hospitals, clinics and medical group. 

Sakai , who comes from Ihe 
Straub Clinic and Hospital in Hono-

lulu , Hawaii , is charged with over-
seeing the financial operations and 
information systems of the UCSD 
Health-care system. 

According to John Alk sne , 
U SO's vice chancellor for health 
sciences. the new position is vi tal to 
prevent" recurrem:e of last year's 
watershed $20 million loss. 

Alksne, who blamed the loss on 
a lack of internal communicatIOns. 
said Sakai "wi II make sure this never 
happens again ." 

"Because of the alarm that oc-

curred lasl spring, we have monitor ' 
in place so we can sec exactly where 
we ' re losing money and how we ' re 
losing money," he said. "We will 
have one person compi ling all this 
data and rl.!porting directly to me." 

After hreaking the news of the 
loss 10 Ihe regenls last May. Dynes 
asked for and received permission 
to begin discus~ions with potential 
strategic partners. 

"Last July, I and Vice hancel-
lor Alk~ne ~at before you and out-
lined the ~i tuation at San Diego. the 

health the clinical enterprise was in , 
and laid out for you a set of option~ 
we were going to look at," Dynes 
said . "The an Diego health care 
community was bracing for the next 
competilive onslaught expected to 
be brought on hy the expecled part-
nership of Sharp- olumhia, which 
wou ld give a private, for-prolit cor-
poration about 33 percent of the an

would have you believe that the

A History of Whitewater 

In 1978, Bill Clilllon won the 
Arkansas guhernatorial race, 
hecoming the youngest governor in 
the state's hiMory. Clinton", salary 
wa, diminutive <It the time, even 
considering the ~i/e of his ~tate . As 
governor, hi~ annual salary was 
$35.000: Mrs. Clinton at the same 
time earned 25.000 at the Rose law 
liml. Weeh hefor ' election day. 
Mrs. Clinton invested 1.000 in 
high-leverage financial instruments 
tied to callie futures. ano in less than 

10 months. she turned her slake into 
$100,000 - spectacu larl y success-
ful even by high-rolling oerivatives-
market standards. The involvement 
of James Blair in Lhis transaclion 
(who had close ties to Clinton eam-
paign contributor Tyson Foods) 
raised suspicions of insider trading. 

Flush with the proceeds from 
caltle futures, the Clintons entered a 
real-estate investment deal with 
James McDougal and his wife 
Susan, and formed the Whitewater 
Development Corporation. Finding 
himself unemployed in 1980, James 
McDougal turned his attention to a 
new proh:ssion: banking. 
McDougal hought a small bank in 
King,ton, Ark ., and named it the 
Madison Bank and Trust Company. 
Three years later, McDougal bought 
a savings ano loan and named it 
Madison Guaranty. In 1984, during 
the carly years of the savings-and-
loan crisis, McDougal borrowed 
$I(X).OOO from Madison Guaranty 
to pay down the original mortgage 
on the Whitewater property. 

The Cli ntons were ripe largets 
for the McDougals: They were 
ambitious, influential and (relative-
ly) poor. McDougal offered then-
Gov. Clinton an irresistible offer: a 
loan of $200,000 from one bank to 
huy equity in Whitewater, and a sur-
reptitious and illegal loan for 
$10,000 from another hank to sellie 
the down payment. From there, 
inexperienced real -estate bungling 
resulted in additional imprudent 
financing, resulting in new loans to 
pay the notes on the old . 

Cli nton as governor allegedly 
interceded on behalf of the 
McDougals when the Arkansas 
hanking authorities began to snill' 
suspiciousl y arollnd Madison 's 
linances. Itimately, Clinton 's 
efforts to protect hi s investments 
and husine" partner are reputed to 
have resulted in a t axpayer-~'\>On ­
so red $60 million federal bailout of 
Madison's bad loans.

MECHA RESPONDS TO GUARDIAN COVERAGE 
Editor: 

This is a leller in response to the 
article wrillen concerning the 
"Mareh Against Injustice" which 
MEChA, eJ Movim ienlfl EsrutiiallliJ 
Chicunuio de A ~IJQn , initiated on 
Nov. 26, 1996. 

We, the Meola DireClil'Q 
(MEChA Board). WCluid like to 
express the anger we felt regarding 
the photo on the front page of your 
Dec. 2. 1996 issue. The issue of the 
"correct-ness" of flag -hurning is 
not our main concern here, but 
rather the stigmatization that affecl-
cd Chicanos/as and Latinos/as on 
this campus after this photo was 
presented in your newspaper. The 
members of MEChA hold a wide 
range of opinions and beliefs on 
many issues, and the burning of the 
flag is one of those very issues. 

For your infonnation: I.) The 
people surrounding the burning flag 
were allempting to block it from the 
news camera behind them so that 
the mcdia would nol exploit the sit-
uation, and 2.) the few individuals 
(who feel no love ror the actions 
that many "Americans" have COI11 -
mitted against Chicanos/as and 
Latinos/as in the United States) that 
brought the flag and burned it were 
not UCSD MEChistas. Finally. 
these individuals burned the flag 
once La Murc/w had already ended. 

The focus of our lIIarcha was not to 
hurn a cu ltural ,ymbol of the 
United States: our purpose was to 
express our resistance to govem-
ment legislation that disproponion-
ately attacks people of Mexican 
dcsl:cnt, .LS well as Latinos/as, other 
l:ommunities of color and womcn 
of all colors, which arc groups who 
have been historically marginali7ed 
oue to institutional racism and sex-
ism. 

Obviously, you have the consti-
tutional right of presenting this 
photo in your newspaper. but not at 
the expense of the MEChistas at 
UCSD who educate themselves in 
the harsh racial and social climate 
that exists hcre. one in which you 
help to create with this type of jour-
nalism . 

In the Thursday, Dec. 5, 1996 
issue of the Guardiall. the editorial 
board also wrote an aniele accusing 
MEChi tas of using chants that 
soundcd ridiculous. First of all , 
chant, are u 'ed during a protest in 
ordcl to en I i vcn the protesters and 
keep the collective energy level of 
the group high. They arc not meant 
to be analyzed and critiqued as an 
essay or speech, which is what the 
editorial board allempted to do. 

Sccond of all. we arc not here to 
argue that genocide and institution-
al racism arc altogether insepara-

interculturaJly can help you in the future?

And now, your newspa[lCr is main-
taming the marginality of

focus of what the march was 
attempting to address: equal access 
to the institutions of this country 
that racist. sexist exclusionary poli -
cies have not permitted. 

In wnclusion, we would like to 
thank Prof. Mariscal for his letter to 
the editor (Gllardial/ , Jan. 13) 
because we understand that it is 
individuals like him that support 
students of color on campus and 
that commit their lives to proactive 
work for socia l change. As for the

thm many ME histas on campus

STARR: 
Prosecutor has his 
own ethics problems 
Continued from pace 4 
attack againsttho~e involved in the 
Whitewater mailer. 

Starr ha.~ ~ured several I;on-
victions, most notably against 
James and Susan McDougal. the 

linton!; partners in the 
Whitewater deal. 

However, the special pro~el.:utor 
hasn 't been the only one pursuing 
Whitewater. The Republican-I.:on-
trolled Senate initiated a year-long 
inve tigation that ultimately found 
that no wrongdoing had heen I;om-
milled hy the prel>ident. 

Republican~ obviously have 
much to gai n if they are succes~fu l 
in pinning unethical behavior on 
Pre~ident Clinton. Look at the 
tremendous effort made by mem-
bers of the Repuhli l.:an Party to pin 
wrongdoing on the Clintons. The 
Senate t:Ommillee just mentioned

familiar with Whitewater. was

where he would exercise diSt:reet 
inlluencc ovcr any potential investi-

himself considered by many to 
have ethics troubles of his own. 

It seems odd that top 
Republicans chose someone with 
his own ethical problems to pursue 
a purported ly fair investigation into 
the Clintons ' ethics. 0' Amato 
seems to have been chosen because 
he could be trusted 10 gi ve the 
Clintons and their staff the hardest 
time possible. 

Dut D' Amato is not the only 
person inveMigating Whitewater 
who has ethical trouhle!'.. Take the 
~o-called "independent wun~el ," 
Kenneth Starr. Starr i~ , in fact. a 
conservative Repuhlican activist 
who represcnts many clients that 
support the Repuhlican Party. Starr 
is sti ll retained hy his tohacco-
industry dients, as well a~ other 
groups that donate heaVily to the 
Republican Party. 

The rhctoric that Starr is truly

Corporation (RTC), a federally 
chartered corporation charged wi th 
cleaning up the savings-and-Ioan 
mess, triggered a Justi l.:e 
Department in vestigation into 
Whitewater and Madison Guaranty. 
When allegations of insider trading 
in cUllle futures surfaced, Mrs. 
Clintun initially claimed responsi-
bility for the trades herself, but then 
backpedaled later in a heari ng. After 
repeatedly ollering conflicting testi-
mony, the Clinton White House lost 
credibility in policing itself. 
WhIte.at. 'GUy 

While Democrats take repeated 
snipes at "partisanship" and the 
alleged sins of the Clintons' 
accusers (including special proset:u-
tor Kenneth Slarr). the mountain of 
evidence of hank fraud , influem:e-
peddling and favor-trading grows.

interest arising from the fact that 

hi~ law linn had repre~ented a com-
pany that had bought Whitewatcr 
property. Amazingly, Starr's own 
law firm not only worked for that 
same company, but Starr himself 

repre~ented the company. 
Thb is a greater conllict of 
intcre~t than Fiske's situation. yet 
the Repuhlicans find nothing

The Cllntons were 
ripe targets for the 
McDougal.: They 
were ambitious, 
Influential and 
(relatively) poor. 
Pleas or innocence sound more and 
more implausible as Clinton busi-
ness partners plead gui lty, one after 
another, to felony charges - includ-
ing Susan McDougal. who refuscd 
to t:oopemte with a federal grand 
jury investigating the mailer. As the 
wall that surrounds Bill C!inton 
crumbles one brick at a time, 
Whitewatcr fon:es us to ask whether 
in fact Clinton is lit 10 hold the 
office to whit:h we elected him. 

Some might ask, "Even if the 
alleg~tions are true, so wharf What 

job Starr has done attacking the 
Clinlons, I wouldn't complaining 
either. 

However, credit for keepir,g 
Whitewater newsworthy docs not 
belong entirely to Starr. A t:onsider-
able amount of credit must go to the 
Clintons, whose poor handling of 
the case will go down in the annals 
of hi story. 

The Clintons, sensi ng the hype 
that the press has stirred up, have 
allempted to minimize the situa-
tion . However, some of their efforts 
have bordered on unethical. For 
example, after Foster's death , Mr~. 
Clinton took it upon herself to 
resolve the ~ituati()n by holding a 
press conferem;e in April of 1994 . 
Comments she made t:reatcd an 
emharrassing situation when one of 
her statements was later proven 
false. 

Another ugly incident occurred

Mrs. Clinton\ - which had been 
under subpoena for more than a 
year by Starr - mysteriously

with running a \.:Ountryr As far as 
the nuts and bolts of real-estate 
finance, nothing. But to the extent to 
which Whitewater is an accurate 
picture of the Clintons' ethics and 
perfonnance under financial pres-
sure, it paints a disturbing picture. 

While there are opportunistic 
politicians who ride Whitewater for 
personal gain (and Starr t:ould very 
well fall under this category ), the 
partisans who seck to discredit the 
investigation f1s "pure polilics" are 
engaging in the dirtiest kind of poli-
ti cs of all - the "Oh, this is just a 
political will:h hunt" defense to fend 
off genuine irregularities in the 
ethics of those to whom we entrust 
lhe protection of our freedoms . 

As the nation 's t:ameras focuserl 
on Bill Clinton's swearing-in cere-
mony yesterday, we heard him 

Tuesday, January 21,1997 

turned up on a table in the White 
House last January. Innocent mis-
take or the result of malevolent 
intent , it still adversely affected the 
public's opinion of the Clintons, 
and Mrs. Clinton in particular. It 
also resulted in Mrs. Clinton testi-
fying before a federal grand jury. 

The Climons have dug much of 
thi s tremendous hole for them-
selves. Several analysts believe that 
most of the Clintons'troubles could 
have been averted if they had sim-
ply told the tMh in the fir t place. 
The question then arises : Why did-
n' t the Clinton~ tell the truth '! 

The be t way to lind out the 
truth is to let Whitewatcr drop into 
the hackground. Without aUention 
from the press and constant pres-
sure from the Republit:an Party, the 
truth will eventua lly emerge. With 
the con 'tam allent ion, the Climons 
will only make the truth harder to 
find . Let Whilewater slip out of the 
stream of consciousness, and let the 
more pressing matters of the nation 
come to the fore . 

swear to "uphold and defend the 
ConstiLUtion from all enemies, for-
eign and domestic." This is no 
empty slogan. Al least , it shouldn't 
be. Leading the free world is a 
heavy responsibility that demands 
character somethi ng that 
Clinton 's conduct in Whitewater 
demonstrates he lacks. 

When there is somethi ng roUen 
in the state of Arkansas, including 
evidence destruction, perjury and 
continuous stonewalling from a 
president who supposedly has noth-
ing to hide, we should be vigilant. 
The answer to Juvenal's question. 
"Who watches the watchmen'!" is: 
"We do ." Through political process 
and prosct:utors like Kenneth Starr, 
we have the right and obligation to 
watch the watt:hmen of our liberty 
with vigilance. The public would do 
well not to forget this.

MOTORISTS NEED TO BRUSH-UP ON DRIVERS' ED 
Iy ..... yu WIIIIace 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Those of us motorists with an 
out-of-state perspective sometimes 
find it diffit:ult to cope with 
California driving. Having driven 
through most of this state, I must say 
that the San Francisco Bay Area is 
the sel;ond-worst place to drive in 
our fair Slate, nexl to Los Angeles. 

But just behind the Bay Area is 
"America's Finest City" - San 
Diego. ot a day goes by when I 
don 't cuss out bad dri vers from 
behind the wheel . So, I've det:ided 
to sharc ollle of the things I've 
learned about driving. and offer 
some advice to those of you who are 
inept motorists. 

Anything that comes standard on 
all vehicles - such a~ wheels, tires, 
seats and windows - is usually 
vitally important to the opemtion of 
said vehicles. You wouldn 't drive 
your car and not use your wheels. 
Therefore, let me remind you of 
some other features of your car. 
h ... P ..... 

Not only docs it accelerate your 
car from a stopped position, it will 
also accelerate your vehicle when 
you're moving. 

Example I: On-ramps to free-
ways. The reason they are so long is 
so that you can accelerate all the 
way up to 65 mph and merge into 
tramc that is likely moving at a 
much faster speed. 

Example 2: Once in a while 
everyhody cuts somebody off. 

Delieve it or not, this is OK as long 
you use your accelerator so the per-
son you're cutting otT docsn't need 
to slam on his brakes. Got that? Cut 
someone off, hit the gas pedal! 

Example 3: When you turn. it's 
usuall y appropriate to accelerate 
halfway through the tum. Do you 
remember learning that in driver's 
cd'! There 's a reason they told you 
that: Most people at:celemte. and 
most CXPCl;t you to do so. too. 
ha,. .. 

The only crucial point I've found 
San Diego drivers missing about 
brakes is that slamming on your 
brakes on the freeway is not a good 
idea. You don't need to use them if 
you notice you're moving a little 
faster than the person in front of 
you. Just gently lift your foot oil the 
act:e\erator for a few seconds. You 
will slow down , trust me. Many 
people nationwide have not yet fig-
ured this oul. You are not alone. 
TumS,,-

Use them. They save lives and 
nerves. If part of your brain has atro-
phied from lack of use, one usually 
uses LUrn signals when turning, 
changing lanes (especially when 
CUlling off someone) or waiting for 
parking spaces. 

Olher drivers are nOI mind-read-
ers. Every driver who litfully 
swerves around you because he or 
she didn ' t realize you were going to 
tum IS doing something dangerous; 
they are likely to hit another car -
or worse, a pedestrian (who, by lhe

wouldn't bother pUlling them in 
every car they make. 

Here's an example of why look-
ing in your rcar-view mirror is a 
good idea. When you are on the 
freeway and doing 65 in the lefl lane 
(also known as the fust lane.) people 
have a ten<.lt:ncy to Ily up on your 
tail and sit there. If you in the past 
have suspected that this was just to 
annoy you. you are right. If you' re 
doing 65, you don't helong there. If 
this happens, get out of the way. 
Even if you are doing 80 in the left 
lanc, it is considered common free-
way counesy to move out of faster 
traffic's wuy. This rule applies to all 
lanes except the right lane. 

Your side mirrors arc also useful 
for t:hanging lanes. They are not 
only meant to be hazards when 
pulling in and out of garages and 
other tight places. You can position 
them so that you can see into your 
vehiclc's blind spots. This is their 
function. 

Here are some other silly things 
I've noticed while driving in 
California. There are a lot of slrect 
signs telling you how to dri ve in cer-
tain areas. It is time to start looking 
at them - partit:ulariy thosc involv-
ing pedestrians and I:rosswalks. 

When you are coming to a light 
near a hill (such as the light at La 
Jolla Village Dr. and Torney Pines 
Rd.) and you I.:an 't see the light, you 
don 't usually need to brake. Ofl' to 
the left is a light you can see that 
will tell you jn advance what the 

traflic light up ahead is showing. 
When you are turning right on a 

red light be sure to look for dri vers 
making U-tumers - they have the 
right of way. 

Oh. in case I forgot to mention it. 
pedestrians have the right of way -
always. This is particularly impor-
tant at the intersection mentioned 
ahove, wherc college students are 
almost run over every day because 
right turners dun' t look in front of 
them or to the right; they only look 
for oncoming trafiic. A lesson for all 
of us: Look around. 

The most imponant thing I've 
Icarned about driving is "Don 't be 
afraid to drive." Use caution, but be 
contiden!. ACl;idents usually occur 
when two people st:rew up - I10t 
just onc, so pay allention, and you 
shouldn't get in an accident. 

I know it's difljt:ult, hut when 
you are driving, as when you are 
doing anything else in lilC, be cour-
teous to others. This dot!s not mean 
docile, but it docs mean lelling pe0-
ple in front of you, panicularly 
when lanes are merging, lelling peo-
ple out of parking spaces, especially 
street parking spaces and not run-
ning red arrows just because you 
don 't want to wait for the next green 
one. Those arrows are there becausc 
they safcly direl:t the Ilow of traflic. 

You are not the law, and you can-
not reinvent it for your own purpos-
es. To those of you who will faith-
fully follow the preceding advice, 
happy motoring!

Top left: Clyde checks on a 
patient who suffered a laceration 
from some broken glass. 
Above: While transporting an 
elderly woman to the hospital. 
John asks about her home life . 
She is often found wandering the 
streets of Ocean Beach , some-
times in the middle of traffic. ~he 
is hesitant to speak, but seems 
afraid of her family, who may be 
stealing her social security 
checks.

lives become painfully real. 
Take the plight of the homeles. which

they call 911 becaw,e of the cold. Many have 
been kicked out of homeless shelters and are

Unil 120 re(;el ve~ many sudl (;alls at nighl. 
especially during the winler months. It 's frus-
trating to field the~e cases. but paramedics arc 
requi red to lake every call that may be a med-
ical emergency. 

In addition to these less serious siluations. 
life-threatening ones invariably arise Ihat can 
be far more depressing. One especia lly gory 
example occurred when two men, driving well 
over 100 mi les an hour, broke through the bar-
rier of a dead-end street. and fell ahout 100 feet 
inlo a canyon. 

The passanger died instantly when a metal 
heum from the car's wreckage pierced his 
sku ll. John and Clyde were harely able to save 
the driver, who probably survived onl y 

hecau~c the ~lcoho l III his system broughl him 
out of shock .

Unit 120 decides which hospital it will take 
patienls upon pickup. This choice is usually 
based upon Ihe severity of the injury and Unit 
120's proximity to nearby hospitals. If the 
patient is taken to a hospital not covered by his 
insurance plan. he will be transferred to the 
appropriate facility later. Palients who cannOI 
alTord medical insurance apply for county 
medical assistance. 

Major Irauma (;enters in Uni t 120'5 area 
include UCSO. Mercy Hospital and Sharp-
Memorial. Less severe cases arc often laken to 
Sharp Cahrillo or Mission Bay Hospital. 

Eadl unit calls a base station ahead of time 
10 confirm beLls arc avail:J.hlc at a certain hos-
pital and to get a nurse's opinion hefore ad min-

istering medication to a patient. Uni t 120's 
base station is UCSO. 

Ten years ago. Ihe only paramedics pro-
gram in San Diego was offered through 
UCSD. OO(;lOrs at UCSD taughl Ihe program, 
and both paramedic students and medical-
school students cou ld lake it. 

The program offered graduates u certificate 
of completion, but nOl a real degree or even 
college credit. Interest in the program grew 
during the '80s. despile UCSD's decision not 
to tum the program inlo a major. After losing 
federal funding. UCSD axed the program alto-
gether. no doubt to avoid a " trade school" rep-
utation. Enrolling tudents who knew what 
they wanted to do with their lives must have 
been too much for the regents 10 hear. 

Community colleges created a new surge of 
intere ted students by offering c~lI ege credit 
for paramedic training at prices significantly 
lower than those of UCSO's old program. 
Recenlly. colleges have beenlUming OUI more

The polenlial savings from consolidaling

Editor in Chief 

It 's Friday night , and a rag-tag 
group of college kids is gelling 
together for ib weekly ritual -
namely, going out to its favorite 
hot-spots to consume frothy 
beverages and dance the night 
away. What better way to wind 
down from a tough week than by 
planting their respective heinies on 
bar stools at the local tavern or 
going club-hopping'! 

Get real, buddy. You' re here at 
UCSD. Those are a bum:h of pre-
meds in the library slurping down 
Alka-SehLer tonics a~ they split 
their time between feverishly 
studying their beloved O-chern texts 
and developing their ulcer~ while 

frelling about their GPA's. Sadly, the 
glory days of college are passing 
them by, but they hardly even 
realize anything is amiss, what with 
thci r eyeballs glued on the torrid 
storylines of their genetics texts. 

I'm sorry to have to break this to 
you, UCSD, but people need some 
balance in their lives. There is morc 
to be experiem;ed in college and in 
life than the musty interior of the 
library, even if it b named after Dr. 
Suess. 

Human heing~ are socia l 
creatures, and inside all of us there 
lurks a party animal waiting 10 
come out. Of course, for many that 
animal is in the deepest recesses of 
thier souls. but it is still there 
nonetheless. And it ' ~ ju~t wailing 
to come out and feed - or at lea~t 
drink a little. 

All work and no play makes 
Johnny a dull boy, and at UCSD 
most of the little Janes and Johnnys 
arc practically comatose. It 's not as 
if there is a dearth of interesting 
things to do around here that makes 
studying such an attractive opti on. 

The fact of the matter is that 
parties, bars and even Mexico for 
the under-21 ~et arc just a few of 
the ample avenues out there to

blo majors may know, letting those 
hormones surge I ~ good for the 
endocrine sy~tcm . 

Being a ,ocinl animal docs 

indeed involve such socia l 
interaction between boys and girl s. 
I know it may seem like a foreign 
concept, but in my extensive 
experience of road-tripping to other ' 
institutions to view and interact 
wi th more highly developed social 
creature , I've seen it happen 
countless times. Boy meets girl , 
tells her a few jokes and ac ts 
charming. Girl pretends boy is 
willy because she thinks he's cute. 
Each has a few tasty adult-type 
beverages, and then they walk off 
into the sunset - or somewhere 
else with the requisite low lighting. 

Fur those of you who have yet 
to venture on to that love roller 
coas ter 0" hormonal bliss, I 
highly recommend trying it oul. It 
may not help you get a higher 
mark in genet ics, but your genes 
will definitcly be happy that you 
decided to ~tart foc using more 
int cntly on the jeans of that 
special someone who catches 
your eye. 

All fun and games aside. I know 
that everyone at UCSD wants to be 
successful , and most of the people 
here arc smart enough to allain that 
goal. However, book smarts and 
glxld grades alone are not enough 

Tuesday, January 21 , 1997 

to propel one up the ladder of 
achievement. People skills and 
personality have a much 10 do 
with landing a dream job as the 
resume. 

Contrary to the popular belief 
here at UCSD. one does not huild 
people skills while in soli tary 
confinement in the library, playing 
DOOM in one's dorm room or 
creating fa ntasy worlds via 
Dungeons & Dragons or Magic. 
People skills are built when one 
interacts socia lly with other people 
- imagi ne thaI. 

Remember the old adage: it 's 
not what you know, it 's who you 
know. Having seen the 
misadventures of many of those I 
know in the job market. I'll 
definitely vouch for the veracity of 
that old saw. And if a st uden t 
spends his en tire time in col lege 
ju~t getting to know his books on 
an intimate level, he' ll be one 
disenchanted individual when he is 
booted into the real world. 

Take my advice, UCSD: get a 
life. If you won 't do it for yourself, 
do it for your future - beyond a 
ste llar transcript and resume, wit 
and personality will make you a 
hell of a lot more marketable.

WHAT'S' YOUR MOST MEMORABLE JOB EXPERIENCE? 

At Haagen Daas in Old 
Town , we'd have foreign-
ers come in. I was just 16 
and I would get excited by 
these foreign guys. This 
sexy European guy came 
to and said [with an 
accent). "I'd like the 
orange Cali stoga." And I 
said, "We don't have 
orange. We just have 
lemon, black currant and 
passion fruit." And he said 
[in a deep voice, with 
accent] , ''£'11 take passion."

I drove a shuttle thaI 
had huge electric doors 
that opened and closed. 
One lady kept coming in 
and out the door, so I 
asked her if she was going 
to stay and she said yes. As 
I was shutting the door she 
changed her mind. As she 
started to leave, the door 
shut on her. She screamed, 
r screamed. The folding 
doors are on her, half of 
her body is out and she's 
turned sideways, one arm 
out. That was the worst

clothes in my size. I wear 
lipstick at work because 
one day I was bored and 
the lipstick was at work. 
You know, actually, lip-
stick is pretty cool because 
it makes you aware of 
your lips, which is actually 
cool. 

I used to work at a 
retirement center and a 
guy threw food at me. I 
gave him white toast and 
he grabbed the food and 
threw the eggs - every-
thing at me - yelling 
"This isn 't wheat!" His 
name was Hal. He was 
super-seni le. He was like 
1,000 years old. He was 
older than dirt, basically. 
That was my last day 
working there. 

One of the customers 
said, "Can I have that sass 
with a bag?" 1 asked, 
"What is that supposed to 
meanT And they said, 
"You know exactly what 
that's supposed to mean." I 
guess because I was rude 
to them.

The UCSD Guardian Tuesday, January 21, 1997 

Against a backdrop of construction cranes, lijis and steel beams, the U.S. 
N~tional soccer team be?an its preparation for World Cup '98 at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium last Friday night, shuffling the line-up in a 
U.s. Cup 97 tournament match versus Peru 

Trying to give his inexperienced 
players some quality time between 
the lines, Coach Steve Sampson 
started many unknown players -
names like Steve Ralston, Brian 
McBride and Predi Radosavljcvic. 
While big names ~uch as Alexi 
Lalas and Cobi Jones were present , 
the theme of the night could be 
summed up in one word: youth. 

" Sure, we might have won if I 
had played some of the 
experienced player, earlier." 
Sampson said. " l3ut I want to see 
these players play. and the time is 
now." 

The team sul"fen:d due tn the 
lack of chemistry on the ~quad , 
surrendering an eighth-minute goal 
to Peru en route to a 1-0 loss before 
a construction- limited ca p,Klt y 

STORY BY 

crowd of 35,232~ 
German Carty's flying header in 

the eighth minute of the contcst 
sent Peru ahead for good. Sampson 
and company failed to capitalize in 
the next 82 minutes. suffering their 
lirst shutout in 10 gamcs. dating 
back tn a 2-0 lo s~ to Bolivia in U.S. 
Cup 'Wi last June. 

" ( told our guys that I wa~ vcry 
pleased with the way they played. 
with one exception: thcir ahility to 
put the hall in the hack of the net ," 
Sampson said . " ( thought we 
dominated the game." 

The Americans did control mo~t 
of the game, particularly in the 
, econd half. creating many scoring 
opportunit ies . In the first half, 
l(l rWard Roy Lassiter got behind the 
Peru defcnder~ . hut he cou Id not 

convert his one-on-one chance 
against Peruvian goaltender Julio 
Balerio COrTea . 

Lalas had a golden chance in the 
second half when Jason Kreis ' 
looping cross !loated over Correa, 
hut Labs headed it over the empty 
net. 

" ( think we played real well in 
the second half," former L,I Jolla 
Nomad Jovan Kirovski said. " We 
were j ust unlucky that we couldn ' t 
score." 

But, nothing was more obvious 
than lhe huge Mexican contingency 
o f fans al the Murph. With chants 
of Me-hico roaring to a climax 
more than an hour before the U.S.-
Peru contest. there was never any 
douht whi ch tcalll held lhe horne 
field advantage.

Nah. 
So let me get this straight. You hit a ball 

- it 's not thrown or moving in any way-
without anybody in your face into a station-

Well , it's not that simple. There are sand

That 's not sports.

Despite all the things that went wrong for 
UCSD, there were still some things for which 
Tritons could be proud. The Pomona-Pitzer 
squad is one of the better teams on the West 
Coast, yet the Tritons weren't phased. 

" We've played beUer teams." senior guard 
Cindy Yamasaki said. " We didn' t play very 
well, and we still cut the lead to five late in the 
second half. But then we got a eouple of 
terrible calls and all of the sudden we were

the club up your ass. Ali, no. NOltlilll , eitlrer. 
I sec. Well , then, there must be a goalkeeper 
or something in front of the hole. trying to 
block the shot. Nope. Not even a shortstop? 

Sports is Steve Young making a beeline

to a streaking. double-covered Jerry Rice 
while being hauled down by Reggie White. 
Sports is Latrell Sprewell burying running 
jumpers, fade-aways and dunks from all over 
the basketball court, despite the tenacious

And "Aloha" means good-bye. 
When athletes dream of the ideal 

road trip, the mental excursion often 
includes fond images 
of an island p3ladise 
interrupted only by 
moments of victory 
in . co mpetition 
against a high e r-
ranked opponent. 

This pa t week, 
the UCSDmen's vol-

leyball team was presented with an 
opportunity to live out the ideal road 
lrip. For the Tritons, the tropical 
paradise was the island of Hawaii 
and the opponent wa national pow-
erhouse and No. 3 ranked Rain-
bows of the University of Hawaii . 

As Triton Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland described it before leav-
ing, Hawaii is the Mecca of volley-
ball and the one place where the 
game is truly a passion for fans and 
players alike. 

UCSD got a first -hand look at 
the passion for volleyball found on 
the islands when nearly 7,000 Rain-
bow faithful packed the Honolulu 
Events Arena for the match on 
Wednesday evening. 

Being the home opener for the 
University of Hawaii , the home 
crowd ex pected hig thi ngs from thei r 
squad, which had come within one 
win from a National Championship 
last year. 

Despite the hostile crowd, their 
highly talented opponents and the 
pressure of playing in front of live 
television and radio coverage, the 
Tritons were not about to back down. 

" It was a fantastic experience to 
play overthere in front ofover7,OOO 
people," McFarland said. " It really 
made it fun forthe players to play in 
that type of a selling." 

Despite losing the Ii rsttwo games 
of Wednesday 's match, UCSD 
Fought the Rainbows from the start 
and forced a number of sideout situ-
at ions. In the third game, the Tritons 

showcd their Division 1 competition 
that they had come to play by forc-
ing Hawaii to its limits. 

After a tough back-and-forth 
game which featured a number of 
opportunities for UCSD to dO 'e it 
out, a questionable ca ll by the offi-
cials allowed the Rainbows to finish 
off the game, 16-14, and the match. 

With no contest to play on Thurs-
day, the Tritons took advantage of 
the chance to do some sightseeing 
on the island. After a snorkeling 
expedi tion, the team traveled to the 
North Shore to see some of the most 
impressive surf breaks in the world. 

. On Friday it was back to busi -
ness for UCSD,again facinganenor-
mous crowd of Hawaii supporters. 
Having een the Rainbow attack, 
the Tritons made a few lineup ad-
justments for the rematch . 
McFarland moved setter Jon Yarri s 
to the outside hitter position and 
brought in senior Satao Minami to 
take over the reins of the offense. 

Both players responded by play-

ing strong matches, with Yarris rack-
ing up 16 kills and Minami dishing 
out 57 assists and combining on five 
stuff blocks. 

After again dropping the lirst 
two games, the Tritons played their 
strongest game of the trip, winning 
15-1 I . With senior outside hitter 
Eric Mai on his way to a match-high 
23 kills, UCSD played the Rain-
bows tough in the fourth game, ty -
ing the score at 10-10 before losing 
the match. Mai played his best vol-
leyball of the young season leadi ng 
the team in kills during both matches. 

"I feel that we are much more 
ready to play those Division I teams 
after getting two good matches back-
to-back with Hawaii ," McFarland 
sa id . 

UCSD will get to test their Ha-
waiian experiences today as they 
travel to the University of Southern 
California. 

As the Tritons bid " Aloha" to the 
Big Island, it is clear that they expe-
rienced the ideal road trip:
