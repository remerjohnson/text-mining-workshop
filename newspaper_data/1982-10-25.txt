Letter to the Editor 

It's too damn noisy 
Editor: 

In hiS letter printed (kt. 7. 

ha\ e passed . Too often 
campus newspapers - the 
Guardian Included 
unconsciously mimic v,'hat 
was done in the past without 
an awareness of \\' hy or how It 
\\ as done. ' 

It was in no way mappro-
priate for the Guardiall to take 
interest in Williams' 
activities. The allegations of 
misuse of university equip, 
ment and funds ar seriou 
and ·tudents have a right to 
know whether or not they are 
true. 

But the Guardian's role, 
oncf' it was aware of the 
allegations, should have been 
purely objective and investi-
gative. Instead, the Guardiall 
chose to pri nt a story that was 
Incomplete and inconclusive. 
Key administrators and 
...t udent s who could have 
clarified or even changed the 
story were never contacted, 
and Williams himself was not 
given the common Journali..,t ic 
courtesy of commentingon the 
LUlirdiul/ 's findings . 

What is wor!>e than the 
Guardi(/I/'s flagrant di sregard . 
for s tandard journali s tic 
procedures IS that t he pOSit ive

not to mention pOSSibly illegal. 

I hope that the Associated 
Students Council will seize 
opportunity to initiate their 
own investigation of the 
sit uation. It will bedifficult for 
them to work out Sid e 

prejudices inspired by the 
Guardial/'s coverage. I trust, 
though. that this inspiration 
will eventually prove to have 
had some meaning and that 
the nature of Williams' 
operat ions will be fully and 
fairly explained.

Letters to the Editor 

Prop. l5 is 'Wrong ments wilh a knifl'? H\ vottng yes. you would be re..,tnrttng I he rights of all cit iren., a., well 
as makingyourselhulnerabll' 

Canole writes back 
Editor: 

"Cri me Rate Drops 60% and 
the Violent Trend in Society 
Seems to be Making a 
Complete About Face." 
Apparently, this is what the 
proponents of Prop. 15 want us 
to believe will happen. [n 
reality. violence in our society 
is a product of the fast-paced , 
intensely pressured li festyle 
that we a ll participate in . To 
equate handguns wit h the 
cause of violence is just as 
logical as aying that apples 
cause hunger. 

differentiating between guns 
used for home protection and 
guns uSlxl for street crimes, a 
criminal will not spend an 
average of $200 and submit to 
a records check before 
comm itt ing a crime. They get 
their guns either stolen, or on 
the black market so that they 
cannot be traced back to them. 
If Prop. 15 pa 'ses, you can be 
sure that these thugs will keep 
and use their illegal guns. No 
mailer what {ali's are passed, If 
someone wmlls a gUll, they will 
gel il. The people who will 
su ffer are those who have been 
rendered defenseles ' by this 
law. 

Our fat her., and grand 
fat hers were ass u rc..'(] I hal the 
ownership of handguns \\ould 
be their right forever. No\\ 
t hat right is being challenged. 
We are all being led to belie\{', 
by thi s proposition, that no 
further legislation concerning 
guns will be enacted. The 
truth is t hat a systematic. 
mass re·registration such as 
this would make it easy to 
confiscate all handguns once a 
bill banning handgun~ is 
passed. After all , Adolf Hitler 
and Fidel Ca ' t ro bot h 
instigated such laws underthe 
pretext of " registration for the 
safety of t he people." 

Lastly, the Guardian al 0 
published a story on a gun 
control s u pporter being 
murdered. Obviously, he had 
not hing to protect herself 
with. In terestingly enough, a

Rece ntl y the Guardian 
pu blished a list of "facl .. 
which stated, fir t, that "2000 
Californians die a a result of 
handgun s every yea r. " I 
assume thi take ' into account 
the unavoidable use of deadly 
force by all state law 
enforcement agencie . which 
will not be affected by Prop. 15 
at all. Second, it was stated 
that "Prop. 15 will require that 
all handguns be regist red, 
thu differentiating guns used 
for home protection an d gun 
used for street crime." What 
was 1101 mentioned IS that 
California already has a 
registration law under which 
each person wanting to buy a 
handgun mu ·t submit to a 15 
day wait ing period before he 
ca n take it home. During this 
period. his crim inal records 
are checked in Sacramento, 
making sure he has no history 
of violent crime. Felons are not 
allowed to bu) or possess any 
sort of firearms in California 
or any ot her ..,t at e. As for 

According to Prop. 15, no 
new guns will be sold in 
California . Citizens wi ll be 
forced to barter between 
themse lve for arms and 
ammunition. Naturally, as in 
all restricted market s, the 
price wi ll skyrocket and very 
few people will be able to 
afford guns at all. Thus the 
rich wi ll be protected while the 
poor remain victims. 

Davenport defends his letter 
Protection is only one use for 

handguns. People do hunt 
with them and nationwide 
competitions are held many 
times a vear. Furthermoe, 
handgun's are used in 
international Olympic 
matches. 

Is t here going to be a knife 
cont rol ba 1I0t next? What are 
t he statistics of stabbings in 
bars, by street gangs. and by 
rapists. such as the one who 
recently abducted a young 
woman at the Mesa Apart,

ably to restrict use of these 
d!Xlrs to t he disabled. Thc ' 
benefit s are obvious. Fe\\ er 
people using these doors 
means Icss upkeep cost and 
greater re!tability. 

It takes Illore than a little 
red but ton and blue hanclIcap· 
ped ins ignia to slow down your 
average s l udent. I hough. 
In stead of having their 
behavior modified to accept 
the arduous task of pulling 
open a door, it appears that 
students are enslaving the red 

button and the buzling 
automat ic doors. (I use the 
word "appear " here because ' 
have only personal observa· 
tions as s tat istical evidence.) 

The duors are adjusted to 
stay open longer t han I hey 
were when act Ivated by fool. 
The rcsult is that dUllng. rush 
periods. I hesc doors often arc 
forced to " 'ork constnntl\ to

figure out I hat this must be 
cven more \\('aring than when 
the d(xlrs opened for a shorter

Monday, O ctober 25, 1982 

Dear l 'CSD Students : 
i\S part of It-; efforts toward spiritual reuemtH)o. the ,\~l 'C"]) 

funds a numlJeI of st urient·(ontrolled alternative media . These 
i ne! udt: h.S DT, \'V..:; Fro 1/ tcriw. I. 'CIIilY im. }ft'It' illtl imtor, I )mph' \ 
Vo icc, etc. Regardless of wheth<:r you partake of these 'icntcl's.tht'tr 
legitimacy should be Judged m light of their conlnbutHIIl (0 a 'iClCI('(\ 
increasingly dominated by the media of capitalism. To say t hal The 
Koala, for example, hm; a low readership and should thereb\ have its 
funding suspended is tantamount to saying (hat LCD's disabled 
·t udents con ·t itute too small a p rcentage of t he campus community 
to merit special assistance. One needs to think about the alien notiun 
of tolerance before condemnmg things of which they are ignorant. 

Most of t he A funded media make no pret ence of being c;bjert in'. 
To be objecti\(~ whde educatmg IS basicall~ Imposslhle. The sign on 
llrey Hall is objective as i~ the legend on the L C. J) map. The 
Guardilill makes Similar claims \vhlle accepting military ads, 
attacking ethnic mInorities. and polluting the forest with 
undistributed bundles of yellow newsprint. To be objective requlre~ 
more t han a tangible objective pre»ence - it requires a commit tment 
to truth and the courage to promulgate it. Granted. Tllc G//ardiall i ~ 
"objectively present" (full garbage cans attest to that ). It lacks . 
however. a go\'erningethical fibr - a spint of honesty and fair play. 

After the du o t settles on their editoriali7cd attack on I~eggie 
Williams' weaknesses. I Will explain what t he AS has done in hght of 
t he obvious need for Ie\ el·headed reason in t hiS debate.

A non-controversial letter 
I regret hm ing to write this. but prompted by a few 

letters and comments bv half witted morons. I will 
at tempt to explain the pu~p()se of the AS Bullettn . 

It has many facets; the first is a forum where Scan 
speak their minds fre ly offering their O/{'ll opinions on 
current issues . Another facet is a humorous article c\'ery 
week or a piece on what the AS is up to. rr the AS is being 
boring, then you will not see boring articles detailing 
tedious meetings. But when something noteworthy does 
occur you' ll read about it here. Thelast part of the bulletin 
contains ads. tudent organizations ads to be precise. The 
AS is saving $4000 by placing the e A UC D funded ad~ 
in the Bulleting. Anyone can write a funny article and 
submit it to the Bulleting. But if you don't like an opinion 
in the Bulletin, talk to the council member yourself. 

By the way, this was a boringweek for the AS, not much 
happened. 0 you are not missing anything yet!

Handling of rape raises AS tneet 
awareness on campus 
continued from page 1 
future assault. is to raise rape 
awareness. " I want women to 
know that even if the suspect 
is caught, t hey should still 
know that this could happen 
again. Females shou ld watch 
out for each other." 

Because there is only one 
ecurity guard for the 800 

unit., Associate Dean of 
Student Houseing Bayer feels 
t he students have to take their 
own precautions. 

In re~p()nst' to qUe"tlons of 
what the VICt im was dOIng out 
so late, [~eading maintain~ 
"She has every right to be (Jut 
at 3 in t he morning if she 
wants to. Women should not 
have to feel they cannot do 
"omet hmg." 

Like Hi Idra, Reading 
emphasizes the point that 
women should be aware. "If 
you are aware and angry, you 
are less likely to be rap<.'<i." 

Pat Uanylyshyn-Adams, 
resident dean of Muir College, 
who is invol ved \~ it h t he Rape 
Prevention Task Force, feels 
the university has been doinga 
good job keeping abreast of 
what has happened. 

According to Adams, the 
universit \' offers many 
services tci mform st udents 
about rape pre\ ent ion and 
awareness. She cites the 
Communlt v Ser\'lce Officers 
(the escort servICe), the Rape 
Education Program and the 
Counseling and PsychologICal 

ervices as a few examples. 
Adams herself gives Rape 

Awarenes Workshops to 
variou. groups th roughout the 
campus. [n a typical 
workshop, she dispells the 
myt hs about rape, such as, 
"She asked for it," and, 
" Rapes only occur in the 
dark ," and she emphasizes the 
need for women to become 
aware. 

"I make suggest ions to the 
groups. I tell t hem to lock their 
doors. and nOl to \\'al k alone at 
night. IIlme\'cr. there is no 
fool proof mel hod to prevent 
an assault." 

Anot her 'ien'ice for women 
is t he self defense class offered 
by the Campu ... Recreation 
Offices. ThIS fall quarter 
cla..,s, hOI\ e, er, \1 as cancelled 
due to lack of interest from the 

~tudents. 
Carla Ruff. an instructor for 

the Women's ,elf Defense 
Council says the class teaches 
women to a"sert themsehes in 
various situations. he also 
maintains that no one is 
immune from rape, induding 
men. 

"I{ape IS a crime of \ IOlence 
involving a sexual act. 
Students must beawarethat it 
can and does happen." 

For students who wish to 
k no \1 m 0 r I' abo u t rap e 
awareness, se\eral work..,hops 
are being offered thIS week by 
the ;\Iesa St udent Jlous i ng and 
the WIK.

An officer and a gen tleman 
continued from page 13 

" I met a guy named To\' who 
used to do Karate work,outs 
every night. One evening he 
described a bout he'd been in 
that shat tered his kneecap. I 
told him he could get out of the 
infantry on a medical 
deferment. After going to a 
doctor he was reassigned to 
another unit as a clerk. I was 
amazed he was in the service 
at all because of his knee. It 
\\as after that situation that 
my under",tanding a nd 
),.no\\ledge of the Army 
bt'came clearer. The Army is 
just anot her huge corporal ion 
that mO\' e" at a slo\\. 
deli berate. corporate pace. The 
Army takes so long to re"'pond 
to Irregular forces. that an 
agile indi\'idual can run Circles 
around it. Mv first twomonths 
of basic ' training had 
physically "ho\\ n me some of 
the Army's techniques of 
problem solving. Techniques 
t hat employed tanks. napalm. 
and hot lead. It was during 
these two months of 
"traming" I continually asked 
myself. " Is this the only way I 
can oblige my country and its 
people? Can r take another 
human life?" Would my father 
lose pride in a son that didn't 
want to be a killer? 

"I left basic training for

I completed my AIT I \\'as

This happened even t hough I 
had answered "No" when an 
officer had asked if I want to 
attend NCOCC. 

.. ow my efforts seemed 
hopeless. The purpose of 
NCOCC was very precise, it 

rai sing more ques tions [ cou ld 
not answer as my grtaduat ion 
from NCOCC came closer. 
'The eastern wor ld it is 
explodin ', fire f1arin'. bullet s

kill , but not for VOlin' . You 
don 't believe in war, but 
what's that gun you're totin'. 

" I announced my inl ention

When I lead I he marches, I he

'Wide river , river of Saigon,

" Again I listened lO our

becoming con c n ' te , a nd

(reassignment to a non ,

Con 'ciencious Objector) and I 
was immediately ordered to

myself from the trainees, and 
remain totally silent about my

induction see med like 
becoming a member of a 
religious cult, I was no\\' bei ng 
deprogrammed. I was now a 
private and was made a clerk 
at brigade headquart ers. My 
job was to process the orders 
that sent my fellow Fort 
Benning ca ndidat es and other 
friend s to Vietnem. Ihe Army 
was making sure I felt gu ilt y 
for my act ions. 

" I remember speaking with

'Don't make waves.' At firs t I

had to find "olut ions to. he 
ended up suppor ting me, even 
wr it ing a letter of support for

thi s increased our love and

II IS a lime to leave a coach 
with gray hair and fmgers 
chewed to t he quick. A 
weekend in which Triton 
soccer coach Derek Armstrong 
must have pulled a few new 
gray hairs form his sca lp, 
popped a couple of Rolaids. and 
walked off muttering to 
himself.

WAIT A MIN UTE DEPT, A high "chool football player 
kIcked a 64 yard fIeld goal? At Oak Park II igh Sch(xli in Agoura, 
Erik Affholter boomed one that school officials said could have 
easi ly gone 70 yards. Affhol ter's kick sent t he entire crowd onto 
the field in a mass frenzy . The funny thing about it was that 
there were still four minutes left in the game. 
THEY (HE) A KED FOR IT DEPT. Tom Collins, agent for 
Clipper number one draft pick Terry Cumming", is asking for a 
lot of money, and the Clippers are willing to gIve it to him . The 
1\\ () side' have yet to come to terms t hough . Collins is request ing 
a two year contract. while Clipper offICials wanl the s tar from 
DePaul to sign for five years. It seeml-> t hat Collins is concerned 
about the stability of t heorganlzat ion wit h Donald T . 'terhng at 
the helm and doesn't want to commIt hI ... pla~ ' crto a s inking ship . 

QUOTES EXTRAORDINAJRE DEPT. t. Louis 
Cardinal fans are certainly rowdy. As Phillie fIrst baseman Pete 
Rose was reaching into the stands for a foul ball, a fan poured 
beer on his head and said, "Hey Pete,thls Bud's for you." 

COULD IT BE DEPT. Well, things are changing. Wit hall 
Ihe pre 'sure on the UC D administration to have a Koala 
football team, Chancellor Richard Atkinson and Vice-Chancellor 
J Watson have secretly worked out a deal with Charger Head 
Coach Don Coryell to run the program for next year. Our sources 
have informed u. that Coryell feels that the strike \\'ill la t 
forever, and the NFL will no longer exist. Apparently, Coryell 
had planned to coach a team in the newly formed United tates 
Football League, but the UCSD admini 'tration's offer of a five 
year, 2.3 million dollar contract swayed his thinking. Finally, the 
administration i<; on the right track .

18 The llCSD Guardian Monday, Odober 25, 1982 

Guardian fencers begin battling '68 Games and is currt'ntly head coach of Cal ,tate 
Fullerton's Fencing Team 
might heighten its popularity. 
'There is one big tournament 
in New York in April where 
they fill t he gym. We do not 
have anything like that out 
here. If we did, I believe you 
would sec many more peOple 
involved in fencing." 

Sports Line continued from page] 5 sophomore. and Keith 
Zakarin , a ret urning sen ior. 

Unfortunately for the 
afficionados of fencing, the 
sport is not going to overtake 
baseball as our national 
past ime. All hough il is a sport 
rich in tradition. it has not 
taken hold in the United tates 
because of its complexity. " It 
isn't a sport t hat you can pick 
up in a couple of day . Fencing 
requires emp loymen t of 
mu des in an unusual way, 
but t he mental concentrat ion 
is comparable to that of a game 
of chess." explains UC D 
fencing Coach Lynn Antonelli_ 

By TYNAN CHMIDT and 
TODD HAINE 

lle D had its first match of 
the season with Cal State 
Fullerton and 'an Diego Stat 
in the UC 0 Recreation 
Gymnasium. Both the Triton 
men's and women's teams 
turned in good performances. 
The up and coming women 
fencer lost 7-9 to an Diego

Played. -

, 

After Los Angele ' hosted 
one of t he first and probably 
last of the FL foot ball all-star 
games. it becam ev ident that 
there is little fan support for 
the player strike. With very 
few people in attendance. the 
game appeared to be a mere 
farce. 

Attendance figures were 
reported differently by various 
sources. The player reported 
5.331 fans. while Coli eum 
official estimated a more 
rea on able figure of 3.000. 
However. most of the fans 
must have had special passes 
or something. because Jim 
Hardy. the Coli eum manager. 
report ed on I y 680 pa id 
adm is ions . Whatever the 
figure. very few people howed 
up at the LA Coliseum. which 
holds 90.000 people. Maybe no 
one showed becau e there 
were few big name stars. Yet 
Dan Pastorini, now a third 
stri ng backup for the NFC 
Eagles, was there, though he 
!:>tarted for the AFC team. The 
whole thing definitely lacked 
the air of professionalism. 

Then there was Ted 
Turner. who bOI h tele\ I~ed the 

game on his C N net work and 
provided most of the monev 
$4.000 to each player of t h~ 
winning team and $3,000 to 
t he losing players. A' he left 
the locker room, Turner told 
the players. "You are the 
game!" The players re ponded 
with "Ted-dy, Ted-dy," orwas 
that "mon-ey, mon-ey?" 

The "all-star" game proved 
that today ' fans do not want 
to ee ju t anyone playing 
football. Whether the fans are 
at the game or watching 
TV.they want to see their 
team win. The players become 
important only if their teams 
are victoriou. And whose 
re pon ible for financing a 
good team? The owner! If the 
players don 't like the money 
they are getting, then why 
don't they try another 
profession. and try to make the 
same amount of money they 
are making now? Many of 
them are doing that right now, 
and they probably don't like it 
at all. 

The final score of the game 
\\'a~ 31-27. in favor of the AFC. 
The next all-. tar game has 
been cancelled. 

tate and 5-11 to Cal Stale 
Fullerton. The men's team 
swept San Diego State in all 
three ~i\'isions (epee. sabre. 
and foil) by scores of 5-4. 5-4 
and 6-3. Against Ca l State 
Fullerton, UCSD won in the 
foil and sabre competition by 
scores of 7-2 and 5-4. while 
they lost in the epee divi ion 7-
2. Team Captain Arthur 
Stevens won the decider as 
UCSD took 14 of the 27 bouts.

Surf meet 
women, first throught third 
respectfully, were Sandy 
Whitehou se. Monica Arm-
strong, and Isabelle Fried. 
Finishing in first for the 
kneeboarders was Bill 
Learner, with Norman Garcia 
second and kip Miller third. 

The populanty 0 1 tencmg I!> 
much greater on the East 
Coa t; the involvement of 
fencing by Ivy League chools 
has helped its cause. Although 
fenci ng has spread toward the 
West. it is nowhere near as 
popular as in the East. 
Heizaburo Okawa. a former 
Olympian fencer who 
competed in the '60. '64. and 

February for the Tritons. who 
present Iy have t he number one 
ranked surf team in the 
nation. He also mentIOned that 
beca u e of t he tough 
preliminary heats many 
potential intercollegiate 
mem bers didn't make it to the 
finals. Roberto Andrade was 
the only non-intercollegiate 
competitor who placed in the 
finals. buUohn Theodore. who 
placed fourth in his third heat. 
and Eric Mears both turned in 
impressive performances. 

Soccer 
continued from page] 6 

All in all . things have gone 
the way Armstrong and 
Assistant Coach Jeff Comfort 
had hoped . "The season went 
more or less the way we 
wan ted i tlo." says Arm t rong. 
"We had a shakey start but we 
played a strong schedule. Last 
year r don't think we could've 
stood up against them (Biola). 
We'll be even stronger next 
year. " 

Comfort echoed the 
sentiments. adding " We've 
definitely come a long way 
since last year. We're getting a 
good sq uad together for next 
year with some good first year 
players like Stacey Holm . 
Barry Thomp on, and Steve 
Davies ." 

Th e previous match again. t 
Biola last Tuesday was even 
tighter. ending in a3-3tie. "We 
cou ld have won it. We should 
have won it," Armstrong said 
af\er"the game. "We had it 
won.

For surf Coach Mike hand, 
it was an exci ting occasion. 
which he described as "a 
tremendous display of new 
talent." The large turnout 
pro\'ided a base for pOSSible 
recru its. and hand ant ici-
pat es a great ..,eason in 

All in all, for competitors, 
photograpers, and spectators, 
it was a warm, friendly. but 
competitive day at the 
breakers of Black's Reach. 

The team is 6-8-2 now. but 
can make the playoffs with 
good efforts in its last two 
games. at Cal Lut heran on 
Wednesday and home to 
Whittier next \\leek.
