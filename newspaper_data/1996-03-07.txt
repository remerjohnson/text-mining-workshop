BERKELEY, Calif. - The 
release of the ASUC Student 
Store's final audit last Friday 
has raised serious doubts about 
whether the store can continue 
as a viable business. The store 
has defaulted on portions of its 
loan agreement with a local 
bank and had its line of credit 
reduced to $400,000, an 
amount insufficient to 
continue operating the store 
through semester's end. In 
addition to not meeting six of 
the eight rules mandated in the 
loan, the ASUC allegedly 
offered Eshelman Hall, a 
building on campus which 
belongs to the UC regents, as 
collateral.

UCSD Professor Secures Permit for 
Atheist Easter Service on Mount Soledad 
SECULAR: Soledad Cross will 
be site of Easter Sunday service 
hosted by Atheist Coalition 
By Ivan DeIY.nthal 
News Editor 

Some San Diegans would call the long-stand-
ing tradition of an Easter sunrise service atop 
Mount Soledad "sacred." This is mainly be-
cause the custom is almost twice as old as the 
42-year-old Mount Soledad cross, which has 
been the source of much controversy in recent 
years. 

This year, however, the early morning tradi-
tion will come to an end, as it will be atheists and 
not Christians who will be leading a "The Park 
Belongs to Everyone" celebration under the old 
cross. 

UCSD political science Professor Peter Irons, 

taking advantage of the "first-come, first-serve" 
policy instituted by the city of San Diego, ob-
tained the necessary permit which wi II enable 
the Athei t Coalition of San Diego to hold its 
service at the foot of the cross in Soledad park 
on April 7. The city requires that any large 
group intending to use a park for an organized 
event obtain a permit. 

The Mount Soledad Memorial Association has 
received the Easter Sunday permit uncontested 
since 1952. 

"My purpose in applying for the permit was to 
show that parks are open to all people, every day 
of the year, even Easter," Irons said. ''The city 
acted very fairly, they granted us the permit as 
they were required to [by law]." 

However, Atheist Coalition Vice President 
Howard Kreisner said that while he and Irons have 
worked together in recent years questioning the

A.S. Debates 
Referendum, 
Constitution 
COUNCIL: Supporter of 
$29.50 activity fee propo al 
gather 3,000 signature 
By Esther Yoon 
Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council reserved at last night 's 
council meeting a place for the $29.50 stu -
dent activity-fee referendum on its upcom-
ing spring election ballot. 
. According to A.S. Vice President Ad-
ministrative Jennifer Nicoll , the authors of 
the referendum petitioned 3,000 student sig-
natures, enough to place the iniliati ve on the 
ballot without the A.S. Council 's approval. 

The proposed $29.50 increase in quar-
terly activity fee continued to raise mixed 
reactions within the counci l, which first 
caucused on the initiative one month ago. 

A.S. President Naomi Falk, in response 
to the $29.50 referendum, proposed an alter-
nale $3.50 A.S . referendum, which failed to 
pass through council. 

"I don ' t think that just because this refer-
endum gets enough signatures to get on the 
ballol means it will necessarily pass and get 
the A.S. additional funding it needs to oper-
ate next year," Falk said. 

In other business, members of the Afri -
can-American Student Union (AASU) and 
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de AZIlan 
(MEChA) expressed disappointment with 
an article published in Monday 's issue of the 
Guardian. 

Marshall senior and MEChA member 
Raoul Amescua, in a public-input forum at 
last night's meeting, cited the article and 
quotes attributed to A.S. Commissioner of 
Communications Farsam Shadab as "misin-
formed." 

"I wanted to clarify that the graduation 
ceremonies discussed in Monday's article 
[sponsored by AASU and MEChA] are in 
no way exclusive, but try to include as many 
diverse peoples as possible," Amescua said. 

Amescua also reproached Shadab's pub-
lic dissent with the practice of the A.S.-
funded graduations sponsored by ethnic stu-
dent organizations. 

"When members of the A.S. Council 
have concerns about such issues, they need 
to contact the student organizations involved,

says new decision 
overturns Smith 
Continued from peee 1 
Plan states that California's higher-
education systems shall be tuition-
free. 

"Will the state follow the Master 
Plan and renew quality tuition-free 
education for thousands oflower- and 
middle-income families, orwill it sub-
mit to the whims of the corrections 
lobby, playing offthe fears of Cal i for-
nians?" Field said. "By rolling back 
fees at a rate of 15 percent per year, the 
system can once again be affordable 
and on par with inflation rates." 

Although UC President Richard 
Atkinson said he would welcome 
state money to reduce student fees , 
hc added that UCSA 's plan would 
actually hurt students who receive 
financial aid . 

" I think it would be adisaster for 
the University of California," 
Atkinson said. "A big pari of our 
financial aid for students comes from 
fee increases. Of course, if the state 
came up with the additional money, 
I'd be enthusiastic about it; but I 
don't think the state will." 

However, UCSA Executive Di-
rector Kimi Lee said that lower fees 
also means less demand for finan-
cial aid. 

"If you were to reduce fees back 
to what they were tive to sil( years 
ago, there would be less people that 
needed financial assistance," Lee 
said. "lthink they ' reconnected with 
each other." 

UCSA resumed its lobbying ac-
tivities after the recent ROJenberger 
VS. the University of Virginia fed-
eral court decision was handed 
down . 

According to Field, Rosenberger 
overtums most ofthe 1993 Smith VI. 
Regents decision . 

The UC Office of the President 
gave UCSA an ultimatum shortly 
after Smith: UCSA could disband 
completely, be replaced by a UC 
Council of Presidents or give up its 
legislative lobbying ability. 

UCSA chose the third option, 
operating through legal loopholes 
until Rosenberger was released. 

According to Field, Rosenberger 
forbade universities from discrimi-
nating against student groups -
such as UCSA -on religious, ideo-
logical or political grounds.

"All ['m tryingtodo is combat

that [Iron 's application] was in-

Atheist Coalition stipulation for 

a separation of

ruled that the crosses had to be 
removed, city officials sold the 
fence-enclosed land directly un-

cross to the Mount Soledad Me-
morial Association for $14,000. 

However, Irons and others 

rlOTNlrl6 

have since argued that the sale of 
the land to the Mount Soledad 
Memorial Association was an 
allempt by the city to circumvent 
the court's decision. The two 
sides are scheduled to appear 
before a federal judge on May 6. 

Irons refuted Kello~g' s clai m 
that gelling the permit was merely 
a strategic move, saying that he 
was motivated by his personal 
beliefs, as well as his views on 
the need for distinct separation 
between church and state. 

"I am an active church mem-
ber, and I'll be singing in the 
church choir," Irons said. 

Ron Harper, an administra-
ti ve pastor at the Maranatha 
Chapel in National City, said he 
thought the atheists' securing of 
the Easter sunrise service permit 
would actually help in the legal 
fight to save the cross. 

"I'm excited to hear that even 
atheists are gathering in front of 
the cross," Harper said. "It shows 
that even an atheist group sees 
significance in the cross." 

"[But] I think the very way 
the government is set up makes it 
so that the cily had to [accord the 
permit to the Atheist Coalition] 
just to show that they aren't bi-
ased loward Christians," he 
added.

v .... '" Services' $5~700 Loss 
Just Anoth. UCSD Statistic 

The recent $5,700 theft of electronic equipment from 
Audio-Visual (AlV) Services serves to illustrate the deplorable 
state of security on campus. After all, the thief or thieves 
entered a supposedly secure room early in the morning, cut a 
hole in the wall with machinery to access the storage room in 
which A/V Services stored the equipment and made off with it 
through the front door. 

For all you would-be criminals, take notice - many of 
these university services and departments do not use motion 
detectors or door alarms and certainly do not employ real 
ecurity people to protect UCSD's assets . If you are planning 

on a criminal career, UCSD is the place to start , 
fn fact, several different aspects of criminal activi ty can be 

explored here. From 1992 to 1994, 356 instances of burglary 
were reported to campus police, and officers made all of nine 
arrests , In 1994 alone, 632 thefts were reported - the police 
arrested a whopping 43 perpetrators . 

And when you leave your locked and alarm- et car at North 
or East Parking, don't be surprised if you find it missing when 
you return. For all the Campus Security Officers handing out a 
dozen parking tickets per hour in every parking lot on campus, 
car thieves ripped off 406 vehicle in a three-year period. 
During that same period, officers arrested 17 car thieves. 

In order for UCSD to protect not only its own equipment, 
but the possessions of the students who support the university, 
it has to invest money in improving security . In the long run, 
the university would save money, rather than spending it on 
replacing everything which is stolen. Furthermore, the univer-
sity would protect its investment. Afte.r all, the studen(s supply 
UCSD with the bulk of its income. 

Administrators, please buy motion detectors and door 
alarms, and, most importantly, hire people to patrol the 
university in order to protect it from thieves. Currently , we 
have a bunch of students on bikes patrolling parking lots for 
parking violations. Redefine their jobs so that their most 
important function is to keep an eye out for illicit activities, 
rather than to make a quick buck for UCSD. 

A.s. Fosters Separatism by 
Funding Ethnic Graduations 

Each year, the A.S. set aside $5,000 for five ethnic campus-
organizations, such as the African-American Student Union and 
MEChA, to hold their own separate graduation ceremonies. 
However, because they give student money for events which are 
exclusionary by their nature, the A.S. has violated the spirit of 
Article II, Section A, Line I of the A.S. Constitution, which states 
that the mission of the A.S. is "to safeguard the rights of students 
to ... participate in all ASUCSD sponsored events." 

The A.S ., using the Student Activity Fees which all UCSD 
students pay, generally finances student organizations which 
are open to all students, regardless of race. Ethnic graduations, 
however, emphasize racial division, particularly because 
nonminority students are highly unlikely to walk at a minority 
graduation. 

Because the students who do attend these separate gradua-
tions also attend the regular ceremonies UCSD holds at the 
end of each Spring Quarter, the issue of separatism is not a 
serious concern in this case. However, these events should not 
be financed by the A.S. 

By only funding minority groups for these events, the A.S. 
puts the ethnic-graduation participants and their respective student 
organizations at a privileged status, above all other student 
organizations. And this is oot to say minority students shouldn't 
hold their own graduation events. On the contrary, these gather-
ings may indeed foster what A.S. President Naomi Falk calls "a 
sense of community for people of color at our school." 

But unlike most other A.S.-sponsored activities, ethnic 
graduations are little more th1n parties intended specifically 
for certain minority groups. Those who wish to have such 
parties should finance these events themselves through fund· 
raisers or private sponsors. They should not depend on the 
A.S. to dish out money intended for all ,tlUknls which would 
be beucr spent elaewhere.

A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE FOR 
LIVING ON THE STREETS

HoffEN 
The Voice of 

Reason 

For seniors, the specter of 
graduation looms more Fore-
boding every day. For those of 
us without concrete plans for 
thc future, this can be a stress-
ful time, forcing us to answer 
impending questions: Where 
will I work? Will anyone give 
me a job? Will my parents let 
me live at home again? Do I 
want to live at home again? 

But fear not - I have come 
up with a fool-
proof plan for 
anyone who 
might be wa-
vering about 

what to do come June: Be a bum. 

throwing a ball around. Now, I am not suggesting that 
you steal a towel ; that would be immoral and mean, 
and it wouldn't be nearly as fun , But if you simply 
"borrowed" a towel from a nice couple while they went 
for a walk on the shore, I'm sure they wouldn' t mind, 
After all , you can return the towel before they get back, 
and they ' ll never know Ihat someone used it. And if 
they notice that it 's somewhat wet, let them wonder. 
Besides, I'm sure they've got a nice washer and dryer 
at home. 

Still, good hygiene entails much more than merely 
a daily shower. In order to maintain a respectable ap-

pearance. you will need to trim your 
hair and, for the men, beards, Cutting 
your haircan be problematic, but there 
are ways around it. Women don't re-
ally need to cut theirs, and men couLd 
just wear it long; but thaI 's often a sign 
of uncleanliness among bums. Instead. 
I suggest finding access to some "pub-
lic" scissors. Our very own Geisel Li-
brary has plenty. 

While I have mused on this option 
before, only recently have I worked 
out the detai Is to make it more plau-
sible. And before you immediately dis-
card this career path, consider its no-
table benefits: It saves you the trouble 
of having to hunt for a job or having 
to withstand repeated rejection . It ex-
empts you from having to fall back on 
that last resort of moving back in with 
Mom and Dad. It's elltremely cheap 
and surprisingly stress free, once you 
learn to be resourceful. Best of all, it's 
not that di fficult. Allow me to eluci-
date .... 

In the first place, to maintain peace 
of mind as a bum it is important to be 
as clean as possible. Most public 
beaches in San Diego otTer free show-
ers, and some even have hot water. 
Beyond just rinsing yourself, though, 
you can quite easily obtain soap and 

But If you 
simply 
'borrowed' a 
towel from a 
nice couple 
while they 
went for a walk 

Now, this can cause problems. but. 
if done properly, it should work. Just 
walk up to a desk and ask to borrow a 
pair of scissors. If they let you take it 
away from the desk, then find your way 
to the nearest bathroom and have at it. 
Otherwise, you will have to do an im-
promptu cut right at the desk. But 
chances are, before they realize what 
is going on, you've already taken care 
of business and will be happy to clean 
up the mess and leave. 

on the shore, 
I' •• rethey 
wouldn't .. Ind. 

Just as easily, though, you could 
waltz into a random department store 
and locate the scissors section. Wait 
until no one else is in the aisle, open 
the scissors and go to it. Most scissors 

horde it in vast quantities. Just go to any local recy-
cling bin and take out an intact glass jar or bottle. Then 
go to the nearest public bathroom (Taco Bell at UTe . 
has some nice ones) and fill your jar up with their liq-
uid soap. While it may not be as pleasant as Prell or 
Pert, it will do the job on your hair as well as on your 
body. 

Drying otT is somewhat more difficult, but still quite 
feasible. We've all seen how people leave their be-
lon,inlS on the SIftd while playinl in the water or 

only have a small, carboard container 
to hold the package in place; and if anyone sees you, 
he'll probably be more scared than anything else and 
won't say anything. 

As for the beards, you may actually have to resort 
to purchasing something. But fear not. Any fountain 
in a local shoppinl mall will have plenty of change 
Iyinl at the bottom - certainly enoup to scrounge 
up close to • dollar. And with that dollar or two, you 
can purchase your very own baa of 10 plastic dispol-

homeless might not 
be so bad 
ContInued from lNCe 4 
able razors. If you use the razors 
frugally and clean them properly, 
they could last you several months. 
Women don't need to shave their 
legs or armpits; enough people have 
already given up that apparently 
outdated custom, so that it no longer 
attracts attention. 

Good breath is equally impor-
lant. If you ask for scissors at the 
library and reek of gum disease, you 
may offend the person behind the 
desk and cause Ihem to question 
your presence. To prevent this, go 
to the nearest restaurant and grab a 
handful of the complimentary mints 
sitting at the front desk. You can ei-
ther try a stealthy swipe right in 
front of Ihe employees. or wall un-
til they leave Ihe desk and then 
scoop some out. 

But if you are more (;oncemed 
about your teeth, you could splurge 
for a toothbrush with your savings 
from the fountain . You don 't really

of a bum isn't all glamor. 
CJean, tiah c:1othes supply the fi-

nal ingredient to a neat and pleasant 
appearance. This, too, may require 
scrounging up some loose change, but 
not much. The Salvation Anny fre-
quently offers clothes to the homeless 
for free, so you might be able to avoid 
spending money altogether. Other-
wise, you can hunt around for local 
garage sales, where shirts and old 
pants often go for under $2. Local 
fountains, pay phones and even the 
ground can provide sufficient change 
to buy someone's leftover disco shirts 
or corduroy pants. 

Whatever method you choose to 
obtain your clothes, just make sure 
that you have at least two sets of cloth-
ing - while you 're wearing one, you 
can wash the other. provided you 
saved some soap from Taco Bell. Take 
your dirty clothes and wash them in 
the public showers al the beach. With 
a lillie soap and a 101 of scrubbing, 
you'll be as efficient as a washing 
machine. You (;an let them dry on the 
grass near the beach, alongside the 
rest of your stuff; after all, everyone 
else leaves their belongings lying 
around at the beach. The only people 
who might steal or use your things 
would be other bums. But you ' ll prob-
ably be friends with most of them by

Of course, you'll need to eat -
hue this isn', as tough as it might seem. 
San DieIO has UI excellent climate 
(and thus is a great city for bums) and 
produces some magnificent orchards. 
Most people's alann systems don't

to lake an orange or two in Ihe slill of 
the night. It's not really stealing -
another will grow back in its place. 
Or you could try fishing; with a bro-
ken branch, some string and a piece 
of orJngc, you could cat(;h enough to 
cal. ightly bonfires at the beach pro-
vide great opponunilies to cook your 

fine catches, too. Think of how 
healthy you'll be: fruit, fish and wa-
ter, which is free from public foun-
tains. 

Still, for a hearty meal every now 
and then, hit the local money foun-
lains for some J1lOI'e change. Fifty nine 
cents will get you a taco from Taro 
Bell. How hard can it be to scrounge 
up 59 cents? 

Being a bum will naturally afford 
you ample free time to pursue a mul-
titude of leisure activities not avail-
able to those who have to work all 
day. No longer wi II you have to juggle 
your schedule to find time to exercise: 
You ' ll have all day long tojog on the 
beach and do push-ups, sit-ups and 
slretches. Imagine that - a bum with 
a ix-pack for a stomach.

in the winter, there ~ easy solutions. 
First, you can catch up on your sleep 
during the day when it's warm. 'Then

Once you senle into the bum 
lifestyle, you can take a bold step. 
Contact any major publishing com-
pany and propose an idea for a book: 
Ihe tales of a college-edu(;ated bum, 
At least one publishing house is sure 
to be interested - after all, how many 
people can claim to have experienced 
what you have? And how many of 
them will be educated enough to write 
coherently on the subject? If the pub-
lishing companies don't offer a means 
10 write the book. Ihe library has 
plenty of available computers fortyp-
ing; so as long as you can "borrow" a

send your rnanusl:ript to the publish-

Suburban kids try their hands 

at thievery in Wes Anderson's 

debut film Bottle Rocket 

riginally a 13-minute black-and-white 
short, BOllle Rocket was turned into a 
feature -length film by director Wes 
Anderson after he showed it at the 1993 
Sundance Film Festival. With the help 
of producers Polly Platt and James L. 
B rooks, A nderson, then a student at the 

University of Texas at Austin , was able 10 
develop the tory further. The result is a light-
hearted look at the lives oflhree suburban kids. 

In Bonfe Rockel, Dignan (Owen C. Wilson) 
pressures Bob (Robert Musgrave) and An-
thony (Luke Wilson) to engage in various petty 
crimes, attempting to give their lives some 
purpose. A few obstacles, however, prevent 
them from being successful- Anthony falls in 
love with a housekeeper (Lumi Cavazos) and 
their boss (James Caan) IUrns QUito be a phony. 

During a recent interview after the San 
Diego Film Festival screening last month at 
Mandeville Auditorium, Anderson and Luke 
Wilson spoke about lhe fUlure of do-it-yourself 
cinema and Bollie Roclcet, which opens tomor-

row at lhe AMC Mission Valley 20 and Ihe 
AMC La Jolla Village 12. 
GuardiMJ: How does the tim reflect 
your own experiences? 

Anderson: This guy in Seattle said he awa 
movie about people who can be optimistic even 
if they don't have any money. I 
don' t think I golthat in Ihere, but 
those were Ihe conditions under 
which I made it. I didn ' I want to put 
big themes in it and make it preten-
lious. 
Are there certain directon 
you consider your model .. ? 

Anderson: I like guys like lhe 
Cocn brothers and Roman Polanski. Francois 
Truffaut's S/IOOI Ille Piano PLayer is like a 
crime movie that includes characters that seem 
like they are from his life. That's kindoflikethc 
characters we have in our film. I'm more inter-
ested in the characters than the crimes. 
How much cId you Ide .. tift willi .... 
clww;ten1 

Wilson: Anthony was pretty easy to play. I 
always think of hi mas a nice guy. I admire him, 
but I can't ever see myself following a guy like 
Dignan. I mighl spend one night drinking a beer 
with him, but I wouldn't hang out with him, day 
in and day out. 

Anderson: I always identi lied 
pretty strongly with Dignan because 
he's the guy who is trying 10 get lOiS 
of projects going even though ev-
erybody rolls their eyes. 
Could you tal( about the 
trend of fiml'Mlcen with

Anderson: It seems thai with lhe accessibil-

possible now. In Hearts of Darkness, the film 
about the making of Apocalypse Now, Franci 
Ford Coppola is in the Andes talking about the 
possibility of a 5-year-old girl with a video 
camera making great movies. I think that k.ind

The Meices 
Dirty Bird 

London R'cords 
The Melces ' third album is by far its best 

effort to date. DirTy Bird combines the band's 
trademark, straightforward, punk-driven 
sound with more sophisticated matcrial, dem-
on~trallng the band 's maturity and cvo lu-
lion. • 

Don't get the idea that the San Francisco-
based group has gone soft, though. The open-
109 track , "Wow," is explOSive and accented 
perfectly by Rocket from the Crypt's hom 
section. "Hey Fella" also showcases the power 
which has typified the group. 

One of the Meices' strengths has been its 
ability to sneak catchy harmonies into its 
fast-paced music. There are several tracks 
on Dirty Bird which arc contagious, includ-
ing the raging "Disenchanted Eycs" and 
"Yeah." 

While It is evident that the band had a 
significant budget to work with on thi s al -
bum, it has avoided the common pitfall of 
over-production. On "Monday Mood" the 
band .even manages to incorporate a small 
string quartet without it coming off as being 
pretentious. 

Another gem is the acoustic number, 
"Uncool." Even though it sounds like an 
unplugged version of "Hopin ' for a Ride," 
from their sophomore effort, the song is still 
a nice addition that helps round out this 
outstanding album. 

The Meices will perform on Sunday at 
the Casbah.

Tori Amos 
Boys for Pele 
Atlantic Records 

The only difference between Boys 
for Pele and your talented little cousin 
is that yourcousi n doesn't sound as if 
she is in a wnstant state of orgasm. 

Amos ' sparse arrangements do 
demonstrate that she is a competent 
songwriter. But , at times, it 's tough 
to hurdle navorless lyrics such as 
"You're my little Fig ewton." 
Without a consistent band to sup-
port her piano playing, the album 

sounds stark and cold. 
The record sounds best when Amo 

downplays the somber piano melo-
dies, such as on the slinky "LillIe 
Amsterdam:' in which she shares the 
spotlight with a rhythm section. 

However, in the end, Boys for 
Pele is long, uninteresting and like 
your cousin ' holiday concert - a 
bit trite.

A Terminal Work 
Weekend-long festival honors 
influential work of playwright 

Joseph Chakin 
By Kristin MadI .... 
Guardian Reporter 

While much of the UCSD com-
munity may not be familiar with leg-
endary director Joseph Chaikin, he 
has contributed a numhcr of rc~ogniz· 
able stagi ng tcchniques in ex pcri men-
tal theater. 

The UCSD theaterdepartmcnt wi II 

host a weekend tribute and sympo-
sium on his career work - which 
includes the founding of the Open 
Theater, a landmark experimental the-
ater workshop, in the '60s. 

An updated staging of the Open 
Theater's 1970 production, '"fermi-
nal," is the weekend's keynoteperfor-
manee. The play's mortality-based 

The UCSD CiuIrdian 

theme and elemen! of Jrief SCCIIIinily 
coincide with Chaikin's current 
mindset. 

Last Sunday's San D~go Union-
Tf'iJJuN fine arts section fealUred the 
grief-stricken Chaikin, still suffering 
fromthe 1985strokewhich 
left him with aphasia. a 
condition which limits the 
ability to connect thoughts 
with words. 

In a stilted statement, 
ClWkin spoke in the Tri· 
bune interview about the 
upd;lted production, which 
opens tonight at UCSD's 
Mandell Weiss Forum and will run 
through Sat., March 16. 

'The dying are often sad; the dy· 
ingarecheerful. We're living short or 
longer; it 's part of the process. Again 

imp~ovisation. Create. So many 

idcas," OuIikin said. 
Chaikin collaborales on the pr0-

duction with Susan Yankowitz, three 
original members of the Open The-
Iler cast and graWate students from 
UCSD's theater program. Borb 

Chaikin and Yankowitz 
cited the prospect of launch-
ing a professional staging 
of the production in New 
York. 

According toNewsweek 
theater critic Jack Kroll, 
"Terminal" established the 
original l4-member, New 
York-based Open Theater 

group as "our most thoughtful, pains-
taking, least malarkey-ridden avant-
garde company." 

In addressing issues of human 
mortality, ritual and illness, '"fermi-
nat" features the extreme physicality 

They shelled It out for your orthodontist bills.

~ It up for your car insurance. 
And forked It over for that fish tank accident. 

Yet they still insist you call collect. 
Thuched by their undying love, you spare them further expense.

of actors who play the roles of the 
livill8 dead. -Blackouts fragment the 
scenes as a means of ref1ecaing pres-
ence and absence within the cycle of 
life. The work contemplates 
humanity's various approaches to 
viewing death. 

The author of Pr~sence of the Ac· 
lor and a recipient of the Obie life-
time Achievement Award, Chaikin 
!llso directed "Serpent," '"fourists and 
Refugees" and "Savage Tongues! 
Love." He will perform his 1985 
monologue, ''1be War in Heaven," at 
this weekend's symposium. 

Registration for the symposium, 
which includes admission 10 all 
weekend activities, is $85 to the 
general public, $45 to UC faculty 
and staff and $25 for all siudents.

TORN: USD takes 
two from Tritons 

• CentInued from PIlle 16 
tons, but she took the loss, as USD 
balled back to score two runs in the 
boItQm of the seventh to defeat the 
visitors, 7-6. 

''[OUo] pitched very well," 
Gerckens said. "She was focused. 
She really wanted to win the 
game." 

Ouo also showed her offensive 
ferocity, going two for four at the 
plate and driving in two of the Tri-
ton runs. 

"[Olto] was very aggressive," 
Gerckens added. "She drove in some 
runs and scored from third on a 
passed ball." 

Senior third-baseman Christine 
Mann spearheaded the UCSD of-

fensive allack, collecting three hits 
in the opener. 

The second game featured more 
of the same for the Tritons. This 
time, UCSD rallied to take control 
or the game, only to see the Toreros 
fight back and win, 6-3. 

Junior shortstop Missy Belmer 
drove in two runs in the top of the 
fifth inning with an opposite-field 
triple to take the lead, 3-2, scoring 
Snyder all the way from first base. 

"I was just watching coach wave 
me around," Snyder said of Bel mer' s 
rope. "That was a really big hit." 

"Belmerplayed incredible out in 
the field too," Gerckens said. "She 
kept us in both games defensively." 

Even with Belmerpatrol\ing the 
infield, UCSD couldn't hold off 
another late Torero surge. The Tri-
tons gave up four runs to USD in 
the bottom of the sixth inning, ul-

The UCSD women's lacrosse 
team continued to roll last week-
end, raising its record to 3-1 with a

Claremont. 
Friday's action pitted the

remaining close at UCSD's heels, 
Whittier was unable to pull off the

upset plans. 

"We just had one really long 
inning," Snyder said. "We just 
couldn't seem to get any outs." 

"We were very evenly

just got the key hits in the end." 

The Tritons will embark on 
a long road trip this weekend.

out ofthe water by a 14-6 tally. 

From there, the effect of Harper's 
rnotivational'words became evident 
The Tritons' final game on Saturday 
was against an improved squid from 
Santa Cruz. UCSD showed no mercy, 
bombing the Slugs, 10-1. 

The Tritons were the first team in 
the pool on Sunday and continued to 
roll against a club team from Davis 
which included ex-intercollegiate 
players and a pair of national-team 
members. Going into the fourth quar-
ter, the team from Davis held a slim, 
2-1 lead. UCSD came up big in the 
final stanza, however, tallying a pair 
of unanswered scores to win the con-

Last weekend UCSD ventured to 

Stanford for the Stanford Ultimate 
Disc Tournament, with the Air Squids 

~ sendi ng two 
~~ teams. The 

~ squads played 
in a fairly competitive field. facing off 
against teams such as Oregon State, 
Colorado, Washington and Stanford. 

The A team was led by captain 
Ben Finkelor, but with most of the 
regular team unable to play due to 
illness, the team focused on balancing 
its offensive attack and having all of 
its players contribute. The team im-
mediately showed its new attitude on 
Saturday, making quick work of 
Sonoma State, 13-2. This philosophy 
also proved effective the rest of the 
day, as the La 10llans went 3-1, with 
the lone loss coming vs. Oregon State. 

~n Sunday morning, the Air 
Squids were matched up against host 
Stanford and lost by a score of 15- 11 . 
UCSD started off slowly, falling be-
hind, 8-3; then it made a furious rally 
to close the gap, 12-10, before finally 
being bested. Despite the disappoint-
ing end to the tournament, the players 
displayed a drive and determination 
which clearly made the event one of 
the best series of games UCSD has 
ever played Teammates Matt Davis 
and1effParlts were outstanding, play-
ing with exceptional poise and leader-
ship throughout the weekend. 

The B team displayed as much 
heart, going 2-2 on Saturday. The B 
tearn, which did not play on Sunday, 
was a mix of first-year players and Air 
Squid alumni. It wasn't long before 
the players adjusted to each other's 
sty\eofplay, defeating Humboldt with 
a trapping defense and playing 
Stanford close before losing, 11-8.

The win over Davis put the Tritons 

into a showdown which Harper was 
"very much looking forward to," al-
lowing him to guage how far his team 
has come. UC SantaBarbara hid taken 
the top teams down-to-the-wire, but 
lJCSD elevated its play and domi-
nated the hometown Gauchos, 8-2, to 
close out the tourney with a victory. 

'This was a much better weekend 
for us [than our tournament Feb. 16-
18]," Harper said. "We are still deal-
irig with the transition to competing 
against Division I scholarship pro-
grams, but I am encouraged by our 
play." 

"Weare looking forward to [swim-
mers] Linda Monroe and Jenny Irwin 
Ooining the team after swim season]," 
Harper added. ''They are both great 
swimmers and great athletes, and I 
think that they will really help us."

UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND~UP 
Rugby 
The UCSD rugby team hit the 

road for the semifinals of the South-
ern California Collegiale Champion-
ship5 on Salurday and overpowered 
the University of Sou!hem 
California, 28-20, to advance 
to next weekend's finals . 

Th~ matchup was tight in 
the first half, with the ruggers from 
San Diego leading, 6-5, at halftime. 
The lead changed hands three times 
in the second half before USC 
evened the score at 20 with 10 min-
utes remaining. However, with only 
two minutes left on the clock, UCSD 
rookie Andy Wilga - who had 
earlier missed two penalty shots-
redeemed himself by converting a 
kick to break the tie. 

Cycling 

UCSD expanded its lead when 
"Dizzy" Dan Brislin scored his sec-
ondtry of the game on the final play, 
to send USC packing. 

Defeating USC advances the 
UCSD ruggers to the champi-
onship finals against 
Claremont at UC Riverside 
this Saturday. Claremont de-

feated UCSD two weeks ago, 10-3, 
giving the ruggers their only loss of 
the regular season. Despile that out-
come, howe ver, the team is confident. 

"Two weeks ago, Claremont was 
disruptive and took us out of our 
game," center Aaron Smith said. "If 
we play our style, we will be victo-
rious."

The Tritons' final game on Saturday 
was against an improved squad from 
Santa Cruz. UCSD showed no mercy, 
bombing the Slugs, 10-1. 

The Tritons were the first team in 
the pool on Sunday and continued to 
roll against a club team from Davis 
which included ex-intercollegiate 
players and a pair of national-team 
members. Going inlO the fourth quar-

Ultimate Disc 
Last weekend UCSD ventured to 

Stanford for the Stanford Ultimate 
Disc Tournament, with the Air Squids 

~ sending two 
~~ teams. The 

~ squads played 
in a fairly competitive field, facing otT 
against tearns such as Oregon State, 
Colorado, Washington and Stanford. 

The A team was led by captain 
Ben Finke lor; but with most of the 
regular tearn unable to play due to 
illness, the team focused on balancing 
its offensive attack and having all of 
its players contribute. The team im-
mediately showed its new attitude on 
Saturday, making quick work of 
SonornaStale, 13-2. This philosophy 
also proved effective !he rest of the 
day, as the La Jollans went 3-1, with 
the lone loss coming vs. Oregon State. 
...--on Sunday morning, the Air 
Squids were malched up against host 
Stanford and losl by a score of IS-I I. 
UCSD staned off slowly, falling be-
hind, 8-3; !hen it made a furious rally 
to close the gap, 12-10, before finally 
being bested. Despite the disappoint-
ing end to the tournament, the players 
displayed a drive and determination 
which clearly made the evenl one of 
the best series of games UCSD has 
ever played. Teammates Matt Davis 
and JeffParb wereoulStanding, play-
ing withexccptional poise and leader-
ship throughout the weekend. 

The B team displayed as much 
heart, going 2-2 on Saturday. The B 
tearn, which did not play on Sunday, 
was a rnix offirst-yearplayersand Air 
Squid alumni. It wasn't long before 
the players adjusted 10 each other's

a trapping defense and playing

test, 3-2. 
The win over Davis put theTritons 

into a showdown which Harper was 
"very much looking forward to," al-
lowing him to guage how far his team 
has come. UC Santa Barbara had taken 
the top tearns down-to-the-wire, but 

. DCSD elevated its play and domi-
naIed the hometown Gauchos, 8-2, to 
close out the tourney with a victory. 

'This was a much beller weekend 
for us [than our tournament Feb. 16-
18]," Harper said. "We are sti ll deal-
irig with the transition to competing 
against Division I scholarship pro-
grams, but I am encouraged by our 
play." 

"We are looking forward to (swim-
mers) Linda MonrocandJeMY Irwin 
[joining the team after swim season]," 
Harper added. "They are both great 
swimmers and great athletes, and I 
thinlc that they will really help us."

Tritons Blast 
BrewCrew 
VAST IMPROVEMENT: On Tuesday, UCSD 
swept the Brewers of Vassar University in three sets 
BySt.v.W ..... 
Staff Writer 

After unveiling its new unifonns 
before the horne crowd at RlMAC 
last night, the UCSD men's volleyball 
team then revealed a rejuvenated play-
ing style with a dominating win over 
Vassar University. 

The Brewers, ranked num-
ber-four in Division m, were 
quickly dispatched in three 
straight games by the third-
ranked Tritons. 

The Tritons found them-
selves down by five points in 
game one before they even 
broke a sweat. Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik called a timeout to make 
sure that the squad did not slip into 
self-de truct mode. 

"We were a lillie tight, trying to be 
too perfect," Dannevik said. "Weju t 
kept telling them during the timeout 
to sen Ie down, relax and don ' t panic." 

Afterthepeptalk,theTritonscame 
out ready to play. Dannevik brought 
freshman Jody Cook-Fisher off the 
bench to rally the team. Cook-Fisher 
wasted no time, responding with two 
big blocking assists. 

'That's Jody 's role," Danncvik 
said. "[He's] the spark offlhe bench." 

results, as the team shut the door on 
the Brewers with two big kills from its 
huge front line. 

The remainder of the match was 
dominated by the Tritons, who made 
sure they were not forgotten by the 
rest of the DivisionllI volleyball pow-

erhouses. UCSD gave the 
Brewers no chance to recover 
in game two, racking up 20 
executions after the teams 
traded sides. 

Senior Tom Black put the 
exclamation pointon game two 
with a huge allack to finish off 
the Brewers, 15-4. 

In game three, junior seller Satao 
Mindmi fired home four serves to put 
thesquadupearly,4-0. UCSDcoasted 
the rest of the way, taking the final 
game, 15-4. 

Throughout the match, the Tritons 
showcased a playing style which fea-
lured high-percentage hilling and great 
defense. The offense was led by Black, 
with 19 kill s, and junior Dan 
Thomassen, who convened 12 of his 
15 scoring opportunities. 

The Tritons also played well de-
fen ively, digging up 39 spikes. The 
combination of powerful front-coun 
play and strong serving kept Vassar 
on its heel in all three games.

by two aces from Guy Mount - to tie 
the score at 14. UCSD'sexperiencein 
close games finally yielded positive 

"This is the kind of win that we've 
got to have," Dannevik said. "We 
have to beat all of the Division ill 
teams we play."

Denny Harper had what he 
termed a "significant moment" 
with the team. 

"It wasn't oneofmy top 10

said. "But we set a goal for 
ourselves to win our last three 
games." 

And that is exactly what the Tri-
tons accomplished. After losing its 
first two contests of the tournament 
to Stanford and San Diego State, the

team was going into the bot-

After the Tritons jumped out to
