After a year of protesting outside UC 
Board of Regents meetings and firing 
insults at UC President Mark Yudof, stu-
dent activists have turned their atten-
tion — and well-honed flyering skills  — 
toward Sacramento, with a ballot initiative 
called the California Democracy Act.

The initiative, drafted by UC Berkeley 
linguistics professor George Lakoff, would 
reduce the two-thirds legislative majority 
required to make any budgetary decision 
to a simple majority.

According to Lakoff, if budget and rev-
enue proposals require support from only 
50 percent of legislators in the assembly 
and senate, much of the budget gridlock 
would be alleviated, and the government 
would be able to increase statewide rev-
enue more easily. 

Lakoff said he hopes that some of 
that extra revenue would make its way 
to the UC system. Chris Ah San, Student 
Organizing Director of the California 
Democracy Act Coalition, agreed.

“There’s a systemic problem with the 
way budgets are made that leads to the fact 
that we can’t get any funding for educa-
tion,” Ah San said. “Basically, the way we 
understand it, none of the problems that 
students are facing right now can be fixed 
without fixing this first.”

Porter’s Pub recently underwent routine renovations, and has reopened its indoor facilities for business. Bartender Luis Saenz, right, is expecting bigger crowds this quarter to reflect the bar’s improvements.

The Coalition of University 
Employees — representing 14,000 
UC-wide clerical employees — filed 
an unfair labor practice claim to the 
Public Employment Relations Board 
last September, after the UC Office of 
the President announced it would be 
implementing temporary layoffs. 

While waiting for a ruling, CUE 
and UCOP temporarily agreed on 
the terms of the layoffs last month. 
Under the plan, CUE employees who 
otherwise would have been laid off 
this year will instead receive a 4-to-6 
percent pay cut. These pay cuts will 
be expressed in the form of tempo-
rary layoffs, or mandated off-work 
without pay. 

CUE chose to exclude its approxi-
mate 14,000 employees from the 
faculty furlough plan, approved by 
the UC Board of Regents last July. 
Effective Aug. 1, 2009 through June 
30, 2010, the furlough plan requires 
18 days off-days per academic year 
and is projected to save $184 million. 

Although the faculty furlough 
plan was meant to represent all 
employees, unionized employees 

could negotiate implementation 
through collective bargaining.

The main perk of the CUE-
UCOP agreement, effective Feb. 2, 
is paycheck consistency. Instead of 
a direct pay cut being employed at 
once or during the period of off-days, 
the plan allows employees to dis-
perse this cut throughout the year by 
receiving consistent monthly salary 
reductions despite the reduced work 
schedule. 

The university is projected to save 
$13 million over a 12-month period. 

Although CUE’s bargaining team 
is attempting to fight the temporary 
layoffs as a whole, they still negoti-
ated the terms of a temporary layoff 
program to help benefit their mem-
bers as much as possible. 

Temporary layoffs have been a 
topic of discussion since all faculty 
furlough negotiations began last July. 
UCOP Associate Director of Labor 
Relations Peter Chester worked with 
CUE’s bargaining team to negotiate 
the agreement. 

“In some form or another, this 
has been going on since July,” Chester 
said. “We started out by negotiat-
ing over the furloughs, and those 
negotiations went on for months. 

But when it became clear we weren’t 
going to find an agreement on that, 
we began bargaining over the impact 
of the temporary layoffs. And those 
negotiations were completed within a 
matter of weeks.”

The plan also encourages sched-
uling of off-days  on the same dates 
as regular university closure days, 
in order to minimize disturbance of 
university operations. 

“In the absence of having them 
coincide, the employees would have 
to use vacation days [or] compensa-
tory time off, if they want to be paid 

for the time, or use leave without pay,” 
Chester said. 

The Dec. 10 agreement marked 
the immediate implementation of the 
plan for Cue employees; according-
ly, the majority of these layoff dates 
occurred during the winter holiday 
closure. The rest of the days off will 
fall on other closure dates scattered 
throughout the remainder of the year, 
and ordinary working days where 
necessary.

“If an employee who is taking a

▶  .7+=; After a long seven months under construction, the Student Center’s best-loved saloon is dusting the dirt off its swankier, second skin.

One week from this Thursday on Jan. 14, 
Porters’s Pub will be hosting a grand-opening 
bash to debut their recently renovated kitchen 
and bar. In dutiful compliance with its lease 
agreement, the pub has revamped its historic 
digs with shiny new sports-bar semblances. 

Since indoor facilities went under the knife 
last May, the pub has kept up appearances on 
its open-air patio, with a fully functional bar 
opposite the stage and servers to keep business 
running smoothly during development. Now 
that renovations are finally complete, owner 
Stephen Lawler and his team are expecting to 
attract a lager amount of students looking to 
grab a bite to eat or kick back after classes.

LIGHTS AND SIRENS

A delegation of nine scientists and 
graduate students from the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography brought 
a scientific eye to the political United 
Nations Climate Change Conference 
in Copenhagen last month, where 
various solutions to global warming 
were under examination.  
       International delegates and politi-
cal leaders attended the conference to 
negotiate policy  regarding the global 
impact of climate change. The con-
vention aimed to create a worldwide 
emissions agreement that would serve 
as the successor to the 1998 Kyoto 
Protocol, which expires in 2012. 
However, that goal was not reached.  
       The Scripps delegation was sent 
to the meeting, held from Dec. 7 to 
Dec.18, by the UC Revelle Program 
on Climate Science and Policy. The 
scientists and students hoped to 
accurately represent the scientific 
background of global warming, cre-
ate public awareness about scientific 
issues and show that researchers are 
concerned with the political aspects 
involved in their field. 
     The scientists participated in press 
conferences, panel discussions, pre-
sentations and side events, discuss-
ing topics from ocean acidification 
and black carbon to rising sea levels 
caused by greenhouse gas emissions. 

 At the event, the delegation set 
up an exhibit explaining how excess 
carbon dioxide causes the ocean to 
acidify, endangering the habitat of 
marine organisms. Professor of bio-
logical oceanography Victoria Fabry 
and professor of marine chemistry 
Andrew Dickson also spoke on this 
topic during a panel discussion.  
        Afterward, the team made its 
mark at the U.S. State Department 
Pavilion, where President Obama 

and his cabinet members were in 
attendance. Distinguished professor 
of climate and atmospheric sciences 
Veerabhadran Ramanathan presented 
his findings on the negative climate 
effects of black carbon, created by 
burning diesel and wood in wood-
burning stoves. Ramanathan also 
highlighted the benefits of using 
cleaner, more efficient technologies 
and fuels.  
      Scripps director Tony Haymet and 
distinguished professor of geochemis-
try Ray Weiss spoke at a press confer-
ence and proposed a way to bridge 
the gap between actual and reported 
greenhouse gas emissions. Weiss sug-
gested using independent emission 
verifications, in which reports do not 
vary by region or country but instead 
are globally standardized.       
     Approximately 40,000 people from 
192 countries attended the event, rep-
resenting governments, businesses, 
special-interest organizations and 

universities. 
      “To have students there who are 
scientists to be able to explain the 
science is very important,” Tamara 
Beitzel, a doctoral candidate for phys-
ical oceanography at Scripps, said. 
“We are the future leaders. [Political 
leaders] need to be able to interact 
with us and pass on their knowledge 
to us.” 
     Weiss stressed the importance of 
incorporating scientific finding into 
political and business operations.  
     “In some cases, it’s the environ-
mentalists against the businesses, but 
in a lot of cases, that isn’t true,” Weiss 
said. “There are a lot of businesses 
who want to do the right thing, and 
they need information that they can 
trust. In that sense, it’s been a great 
success because the word is getting 
out.”

Though our time spent away at college is supposed to con-stitute the golden years, the 
mystical forces of res-life offices and 
Craigslist ads have been known to put 
a damper on your fun: They’re the 
ones responsible for your god-awful 
roommate. 

To avoid the hassle of moving 
into new digs, though, it’s preferable 
to fight back, treating your in-house 
potbellied nudist with the same unsa-
vory medicine you’ve been force-fed 
until he can’t take it anymore.

Here, How-to Guru examines the 
careful art of roommate evacuation. 

The first obvious investment for 
any hopeful evictor: a bumpin’ sound 
system. It’s important to first deter-
mine what kind of music will most 
irritate your roommate, as it would be 
an utter waste to spend half an hour 
blasting System of a Down only to 
learn that the Dungeons & Dragons 
fanatic with whom you share a toilet 
is actually into them. Once you’ve 
finally hit a nerve, milk Mariah 
Carey’s falsetto for all it’s worth; 
there’s no time quite like 7 a.m. for a 
croaky “Fantasy” sing-along. 

 Of course, just you and Mariah 
won’t suffice. If a new roommate’s 
invading your territory, capitalize 
on the fact that this is your home, 
and that your toenail clippings won’t 
be leaving the living-room carpet 
anytime soon. A few stray toilet-seat 
pubic hairs might be kind of gross; an 
outright refusal to shut the bathroom 
door during business time, however, 
is the stuff of eviction champions. 

On that note, outrageous dis-
plays of disregard for cleanliness are 
generally safe bets — but only those 
capable of testing your roommate’s 
kindness. Don’t refrain from bathing 
unless you can commit until a colony 
of flies encircle your head like an 
insectan halo. Instead, consider giv-
ing up on dishwashing; the higher the 
stack of Pizza Pocket-encrusted plates 
left to haunt your roommate’s dreams, 
the better. 

The separate but comparably effec-
tive tactic of uncomfortable flirtation 
also works wonders. Come home 
drunk — or, for optimum creepiness, 
completely sober — and feign attrac-
tion to this roommate or his/her sig-
nificant other, even if he/she possesses 
all the sexual allure of roadkill. 

 Don’t attempt such a daring 
play unless you’ve got serious acting 
chops. Bursting into giggles mid-
come-on will only make you into 
the dick, which will only prompt 
revenge. The objective, after all, is 
not to wreck your roommate rela-
tionship; it’s to end it definitively, 
with no turning back — not even for 
those stale Twinkies he left in your 
side of the pantry.

Most importantly, though, don’t 
be deterred by initial feelings of 
embarrassment at your newfound 
inconsideration. You may not be roll-
ing out the welcome mat, but by the 
time your humble abode no longer 
reeks of nudist musk, you’ll be too 
relieved to worry about guilt.

STATE NEWS —  Mere weeks after the UC 
Board of Regents approved a 32-percent fee 
hike, a group of UC students and faculty have 
stashed away their “Lay off Yudof” picket signs 
and shifted their sights to higher ground: the 
California congressional floor. 

Authored by UC Berkeley professor of 
linguistics George Lakoff, the California 
Democracy Act would allow legislative decisions 
regarding government spending to be passed by 
a simple majority, rather than the current two-
thirds super majority. A simple 14-word change 
to the California constitution might not be a 
permanent solution to the UC budget crisis, but 
the bill would be a giant leap forward for our 
dysfunctional legislative system. 

In 1978, Proposition 13 amended the 

California Constitution to require a two-thirds 
majority vote on every finance-related bill. But 
32 years later, California finds itself in an eco-
nomic gridlock. With the deciding vote thrust 
into the hands of a one-third legislative minor-
ity, the budget isn’t often passed on time, and 
public services have been cut as a result. 

When the California Master Plan for Higher 
Education was designed in 1960, its goal was 
to make public higher education free to all 
California residents. Since then, however, UC 
student fees have ballooned from $147 a year to 
above $10,000 for the 2010-11 academic year — 
largely due to dwindling state funds. Legislative 
measures to financially support higher educa-
tion seldom meet two-thirds approval.

Instead of placing the power in the hands 

of the majority, the current system signs power 
away into the hands of a few dissenting legisla-
tors. With only a simple majority needed, state 
legislators would be able to pass the budget a lot 
sooner — and the sooner the budget is passed, 
the sooner public institutions (the UC system 
included) get their handouts. 

As it stands, California has the only state 
constitution that requires the two-thirds 
majority. And while there’s no guarantee that 
this reform would be a reliable boost to public 
education, there’s evidence it might help. Before 
Proposition 13, our schools consistently ranked 
in the top three in the country; today, according 
to UCLA researchers, we’ve fallen to 48th.

QUICKTAKES

The near Christmas tragedy this year has resulted in even tighter airport measures, as promised by 
President Obama in the past week. 

But travelers already undergo scrupulous safety 
measures, ranging from the removal of shoes in 
security lines to the prohibition of  electronics dur-
ing specified durations of the flight. Yet these security 
measures have yet to save us from another threat. If 
the bomb’s not wedged inside the toe of a shoe, it’s 
strapped beneath someone’s boxers. 

Even if the TSA introduces a more extensive body 
search, we’ll still be one step behind the next bomb-
concealing innovation. Travel will never fully be 
secure, but security has to be more aware of subtle,  
instinctual signs of bad intent to trace the mechani-
cally undetectable.

When the U.S. was warned about pos-sible hijackers before 9/11, our gov-
ernment stood by idly — and still it seems 
that, despite a decade’s worth of pre-flight 
pat-downs, airport security is a little slow 
on the uptake.

Like the 9/11 terrorists, Abdulmutallab 
checked in with no bags and paid cash for 
his plane ticket, something that should 
have — but didn’t — at least calmly alert 
airport officials. And, like the 9/11 terror-
ists, the U.S. government had been given 
several obvious warnings. 

Thankfully, the final outcome wasn’t 
nearly so disastrous this time around — 
but if the same threat indicators continue 
to go unchecked, we won’t be nearly so 
lucky next time around.

The failed Christmas-day bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 raises doubts about American 
intelligence abroad.

Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab — the Nigerian man 
who made it onto a flight to Detroit with an explosive 
in his underwear — wasn’t necessarily subtle in his 
attempt to blow his flight up, yet most hints were 
overlooked. Abdulmutallab wrote about his fantasy 
of becoming a Muslim holy warrior in public online 
posts. Shouldn’t a man whose father altered the U.S. 
Embassy in Nigeria about the possibility of his son’s 
violent intentions and whose name was on a coun-
terterrorism watch list have at least been stopped at 
security? Apparently the National Counterterrorism 
Center, which unites every scrap of evidence on 
suspects, missed the memo; Abdulmutallab made it 
aboard the plane scot-free.

President Obama blamed Abdulmutallab’s pres-
ence on the flight to a communication breakdown 
among intelligence agencies — Abdulmutallab, he 
said, should have been on a no-fly list. 

No shit.
With terrorists constantly employing new attack 

methods — first the shoe bombs, then the water 
bottles and now the clever explosive-underwear 
approach — the U.S. Transportation Security 
Administration is struggling to keep up. The intel-
ligence network must act more preemptively at inter-
national locations, or it runs the risk of more success-
ful terror attacks in the future.

JOB# 726444

Dear Editor,
It has been over a month since A.S. 

Council issued its vote nullifying the 
chances of having a University Centers 
Advisory Board Winter Quarter 
referendum concerning the Loft. As 
both a Sixth College freshman sena-
tor and A.S. Sixth College senator, I 
have had two years of experience with 
the bureaucratic labyrinth that is A.S. 
Council. In this discussion of the cur-
rent council’s position on the Loft, 
my experience with A.S. allows me to 
testify to its own hypocrisy concerning 
student involvement on this campus. 

For those of you who haven’t vis-
ited the Loft, it is the most amazing 
thing that has ever happened to this 
campus. Students can come to free 
world-class shows with the Loft’s Pay 
As You Can (PAYC) method of pay-
ment. With the combined Loft staff 
of students and professional planners, 
this space offers true real-world pro-
duction opportunities for everyone 
involved. Students at the Loft are paid, 
but anyone who wants to learn about 
and support the arts can help through 
the Loft Street Team. As an all-inclu-
sive endeavor, anyone can be a part of 
the Loft and contribute to making it 
an even better place. 

The public university system’s real-
ity is its profound lack of funding. The 
Loft, like so many other organizations 
on campus, does not have permanent 
funding and would need a referen-
dum by Winter Quarter 2010 to main-
tain the same level of programming. 
The proposed fee of $4.65 per quarter 
has been calculated to ensure sustain-
able programming for the Loft. The 
normal cost for unsubsidized shows 
is about $10 per person. By support-
ing this referendum, one could pay 
more or less the same for a year of free 
shows rather than for just one.  

To solve one of A.S. Council’s 
many supposed problems with how 
the UCAB is supported, a Loft refer-
endum proposal was presented, but 
was marked as having no student 
oversight. Student oversight is another 
way of saying A.S. oversight. Those 
elected to positions within A.S. don’t 
like the idea of a space on campus, 
creating student community and cam-
pus life, without their involvement. By 
not allowing the campus to vote on a 
referendum, A.S. Council is prevent-
ing students from actually having a 
voice before they even have a chance 
to vote. Delaying the vote to Winter 
Quarter and thus forcing it to appear 
on a referendum in the Spring forces 
the Loft to stop offering what its cam-
puswide following has come to expect.

The potential Winter Quarter Loft 
referendum was shot down due to 
lack of student control, not enough 
information and a rushed and incom-
plete presentation. These reasons for 
voting it down are incorrect. The Loft 
staff had been working with UCAB 
since last year on the referendum and 
the supposed fair debate and deliber-
ating was quickly controlled, censored 
and decided by A.S. higher-ups before 
the discussion even began. The voice 
of the student body — the people who 
will actually have to pay for the Loft 
and can vote yes or no of their own 
accord — are not being heard.

Student manager, the Loft

Even if it allowed the UC system 

to get its hands on state funding 
sooner, though, the CDA isn’t a cure-
all to the UC budget crisis; it will 
obviously only benefit the UC system 
as long as the majority is in favor of 
our cause. The coalition hopes that 
once a simple majority has control, 
it’ll levy taxes, and some of that tax 
revenue will run off into the UC sys-
tem — but that’s far from guaranteed.

In fact, the bill could hurt higher 
education even more. This past June, 
a proposal to further reduce funding 
for education failed before the state 
senate. But without Proposition 13’s 
two-thirds majority requirement, the 
25-14 vote would have been enough 
to cut funding to even more ridicu-

lous lows — and the university would 
find itself even deeper in the hole. 

On UC campuses across the 
state, students are rallying support 
for the bill. At UCSD, A.S. campus-
wide senator Wafa Ben Hassine, our 
CDA Coalition chapter coordinator, 
will be harnessing the support of 
students and faculty by presenting 
petitions.

Because the Attorney General 
approved the initiative over winter 
break, Hassine said, the initiative 
is just now taking off. Hassine just 
began collecting signatures last 
Friday, but she’s already confident 
they’ll meet their million-signature 
mark by the April deadline. In addi-
tion to public support, Hassine 
explains that many public officials 

have already given their endorse-
ments and support to the act.

While this grassroots effort has a 
less-than-promising 10 to 15 people 
currently involved on campus, its 
intentions are in the right place: It 
is indeed time we quit antagoniz-
ing the regents and knock directly 
on the state capitol’s door. But the 
efforts can’t stop here; for any kind 
of lasting change, we’ll need to lobby 
legislators and voters to prioritize 
higher education. Their lack of sup-
port is, after all, the real root of the 
UC system’s problems — no matter 
how much red tape we cut to make 
their jobs easier.

“The pub used to operate more like a conces-
sion stand,” Lawler said. “But we’re opening it up 
to a full bar and grill to accommodate the student 
community here.”

The latest construction is the first major reno-
vation to the space since February 2008, when 
Lawler and Moses Muñoz took over management 
of the pub from its original owner and namesake, 
UCSD alumnus Rob Porter. Their original lease 
agreement with the university stipulated they must 
renovate indoor amenities on their own dime while 
the university would refurbish the roof and add 
new paneling.

As a student at UCSD in the early ’90s, Porter 
decided he wanted to re-open the Triton Pub  — as 
it was known during the ’70s and ’80s — after a 
four-year hiatus. 

When university officials began construction 
of the Price Center in the late ’80s, they decided 
to close the Triton Pub so they could advertise 
the space currently occupied by Round Table 
Pizza as the only on-campus location with an 
alcohol license. 

Consequently, the owners of the Triton Pub 
decided they didn’t want to participate in the 
bidding war for the new space, and called it 
quits. 

In 1992, officials rethought the closure, opting 
to re-establish the lease for a pub on the funkier 
side of campus. Porter, who had been interested in 
creating a student business and was eager to create 
a space for students to hang out, made an offer. 

In June 1992, shortly after graduating, Porter 
received a call from the university informing him 

that his proposal had been selected. 
“Going to school, I always wanted a cool, little bit 

more of a hangout kind of a place,” Porter said.
In Porter’s day, the pub was one full, contiguous 

space — without the dividing walls that now define the 
stage room, kitchen and bathroom areas. 

The university finished making renovations to the 
space in 1993, when Porter officially began managing 
the pub. At that time, the pub only consisted of the bar 
and bathroom areas — 1,300 sq. ft. at the front of the 
building. 

In 1995 however, the university agreed to expand 
the lease, handing off the additional stage and patio 
areas to Porter’s community vision. 

After over a decade at the Pub’s helm, Porter decid-
ed to move on. In 2008, Lawler and Muñoz officially 
took the wheel. 

The new management team has hired fewer stu-
dents than Porter, opting for a full-time staff behind 
the scenes in the kitchen and up front at the bar. 

“The pub used to exclusively employee their stu-
dents, or as in my case, UCSD alumni,” said Steve York, 
a former Porter’s Pub employee. 

According to York, the decision to hire less students 
changed the pub’s atmosphere. 

David McClearly, who recently graduated last year 
and still stops by twice a day, also worked at the pub 
from April 2008 to April 2009. According to McClearly, 
the pub’s menu expansion in early 2008 helped bring in 
a lot of customers despite the price increase on beers. 
He said he expects the recent renovations will do much 
of the same. 

After the most recent renovations were officially

8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, JANUARY 4, 2010� FOCUS

finished by the end of Fall Quarter, 
many of the bar’s interior amenities 
have been upgraded. In the kitchen, 
a newly equipped char broil grill 
has expanded food options in order 
to accommodate more students 
while the new cooling unit (which 
keeps beers and other stored bev-
erages cold) will allow the pub to 
offer a wider selection of beers. By 
Jan. 14, the team will be coming out 
with a new menu. 

“Last week, I had my first carne 
asada burrito at Porter’s Pub — it’s 
been a long time coming,” said 
Porter. “We were making meals 
without a full kitchen, so we were 
naturally limited in our menu offer-
ings.”

Though the pub’s foundational 
architecture remains much the 
same, most doorways have been 
expanded to accommodate patrons 
with disabilities. In the main dining 
area, a spotless gray wall divides the 
kitchen from patrons, studded with 
a pick-up window for food orders. 

According to bartender Luis Saenz 
— a nonstudent employee who has 
worked for the Pub for about a year 
— a roomier kitchen structure and 
wider walkways between the kitchen, 
bar and seating area have made things 
easier on the staff. Not only that, but 
the new appliances have also made 
recipes more manageable for the pub’s 
cooks.

“Before, the cooks were mak-
ing half that stuff up in their head,” 

Saenz joked. 
The pub has also adopted a 

swankier, clean-cut aesthetic. 
Thanks to its mandatory upgrade, 
shoddy carpets were replaced with 
shiny new spill-proof flooring, the 
walls were painted a dark beige and 
Lawler threw up three new flat-
screen televisions. 

According to Lawler, he also 
hopes to install an additional wine 
rack for faculty, students and alum-
ni who aren’t beer lovers. 

Lawler said he hopes the reno-
vations will provide UCSD students 
— 21 or not — with more reasons 
to stop by the pub. The venue will 
be opening earlier and staying 
open later, with breakfast avail-
able all day. In addition, Lawler 
said he’s looking to serve entrees 
inspired by traditional cuisine from 
the Mediterranean, the American 
South and other regions. 

“We wanted to change things up 
so we could offer more to the stu-
dent community,” said Lawler. 

Now that the roar of construc-
tion has faded, Lawler and his team 
have a new concert series in the 
works, in addition to a winter beer 
garden (building off the momen-
tum of this summer’s Reggae in the 
Garden). 

“It’s going to be good,” Saenz 
said. “I can’t wait to get things rol-
lin’ and get more people in here.”

JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK

SITESEEN

A fter a winter-break won-derland of plastic trees and manmade explosives, it’s 
the right time you revisited some 
simple joys of human existence: 
blue skies, a warm fire and colossal 
rocks.

Though Joshua Tree National 
Park’s 800,000 acres of desert — 
scattered with bedrock boulders 
and Seussical shrubbery — are 
anything but simple, they provide 
ideal ground for getting back to 
basics. 

Each of the site’s nine camp-
grounds offers something different: 
a spot between some gargantuan 
stone, a clear view of the desert 
horizon or close proximity to fields 
brimming the park’s namesake 
tree. Enter through Joshua Tree’s 

south entrance to avoid paying $15 
for a vehicle pass, then head north: 
The coolest campsites are near the 
center of the park. If it’s just you 
and couple of friends, try White 
Tank or Jumbo Rocks. If you’ve got 
an entire posse in tow, try Indian 
Cove or Sheep Pass. Or, in the 
unlikely event that you’re traveling 
with cattle, they’re allowed at Black 
Rock and Ryan. 

Camping fees vary depending 
on where you choose to settle, but 
range from $15 to $40.

There are lots of outdoorsy 
things to do at Joshua Tree 
besides drink beer at your camp-
site. If you’re into rocks that look 
like human skulls, you can visit 
Skull Rock (check the creative 
moniker). If you want to climb 
regularly shaped rocks, there are 
about seven different sites at your 
fingertips. Most of the park’s rec-
ommended day hikes are a breeze. 
It’s three miles roundtrip to a 

49-palm oasis and four to a lost 
horse mine, and you can always 
hike up Mastodon Peak or Ryan 
Mountain to work off that holiday 
fruitcake flab.

If you’d rather cruise the scen-
ery in your four-wheeler, try the 
Geology Tour road’s rough path. 
Beware: The further you drive, the 
rockier the road. Plan to return 
around sundown — you won’t 
want to miss the desert’s flashy 
pink sunset anymore than you’d 
want to get stuck on the trail in 
complete darkness.

Like any of California’s national 
parks, it’s better to visit Joshua Tree 
in spring or fall. But it’s not impos-
sible to brave the desert sands in 
the winter; just make sure to bring 
extra firewood. And blankets. Like, 
five of them. There’s nothing like a 
temperature drop to ruin a merry 
round of campfire kumbaya.

first became law with the passage of 
Proposition 13 in 1978. The main pur-
pose of Prop. 13 was to reduce the high 
property taxes that accompanied the 
real-estate boom of the 1970s, and cap 
the percentage by which they could be 
increased each year. 

According to Ah San, the two-thirds 
requirement — intended to inhibit both 
the raising of taxes and the imposing of 
new ones — is partially responsible for 
California’s current economic strife.

“The majority of legislators … want 
to be able to raise the revenue that is 
necessary to fund higher education,” 
Ah San said. “[But] just 34 percent of 
state legislators in either house in the 
state legislature, all they have to do is 
just say “No” until they get a budget that 
they want.”

Last year, legislators faced off for 
months – largely along party lines 
– over whether they should combat 
California’s economic crisis by rais-
ing taxes, resulting in a record-setting 
85-day delay in the budget’s release.

Though Lakoff ’s proposal would 
help avoid such setbacks in the future, 
there is no guarantee that the initia-
tive would ensure financial support for 
public higher education. Instead, the 

CDAC is appealing to students on the 
grounds that if new sources of revenue 
are found, more money will become 
generally available — and some of that 
will most likely be devoted to colleges 
and universities. 

The coalition is working in con-
junction with nonstudent organizers 
in the larger California Majority Rule 
campaign, and currently has a chapter 
at every UC campus except Riverside. 
Students from schools all over the state 
— including UC San Diego — have 
begun the hunt for public support and, 
more importantly, signatures.

The initiative can be passed by 
voters with no legislative input, but 
requires 694,354 signatures in the plan-
ning stages in order to make it onto 
the November ballot. Additionally, a 
verification process — during which 
many of the signatures can be thrown 
out — means the coalition must aim 
for 1.3 million signatures by the April 
15 deadline. 

Currently, according to Ah San, 
they have around 3,000. 

“We’re just organizing now,” Lakoff 
said. “This is a last-minute grassroots 
effort. It was not planned in advance; 
there is no big money behind it … It’s 
just going to take a while.”

The UCSD chapter of the CDA 
began organizing earlier this week, 
when a total of 15 members gathered 
75 signatures on their first day of col-
lecting. Chapter director Wafa Ben-
Hassine said the chapter is aiming to 
contribute 2,000 signatures to the over-
all campaign.

Opponents of the act argue that 
removing the two-thirds majority 
would result in higher taxes amid an 
economic recession, and would nega-
tively impact the growth of industry.

“The two-thirds rule is the thin blue 
line protecting California from ruin-
ation,” Chris Reed, columnist for the 
San Diego Union-Tribune, said.

Should the campaign gather enough 
signatures by mid-April, the act will 
await voter approval on the Nov. 2 
ballot. 

Ah San said he is optimistic about 
the initiative’s chances of passing.

“People know that it’s time for a 
change,” Ah San said. “This is the year 
where we have to pass it. Otherwise 
we’re just going to be facing a bigger 
mess in California — as if it can get any 
worse than it is.”

4-percent cut — which corresponds 
to 11 days off —uses up all the closure 
days at the holiday time and adds to 
that the days in March and perhaps 
June, there will be relatively few addi-
tional days that would have to be taken 
off,” Chester said. 

Despite these terms, CUE represen-
tatives said members are still unhap-
py about the pay decrease. Further 
negotiations will continue later this 
month, with a mediator between the 
two groups.

“UC brought to us that salary reduc-
tion and furlough plan, and we did not 
agree to that,” CUE bargaining team 
member Dianna Sahhar said. “They 

said if we don’t agree to this, we are 
going to lay you off temporarily instead. 
And we said, well, that’s illegal — that’s 
not bargaining, that’s the same choice. 
So we filed for unfair labor practice, 
which we have not heard the results of 
yet. In the meantime, what we did was 
we bargained the effects of the layoff.” 

Certain campuses — including 
UCSD, UCSF and UC Davis — have 
rejected the CUE-UCOP plan, choosing 
not to implement the temporary layoffs. 

“At UCSD, Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox is the one who said it’s unfair,” 
Sahhar said. “ After break, they might 
be sending out temporary layoff notices, 
but they haven’t yet. We’ll see what hap-
pens.” 

While much negotiation still lies 
ahead, Sahhar said that members of 
CUE are content that, at minimum, 
some effects of the layoffs have been 
mitigated. 

“We’re all unhappy with the pay 
cuts, but our members are really happy 
with what we negotiated for them,” 
Sahhar said. “It’s less cuts than what it 
would have been otherwise, and at least 
now they get their vacation, and at least 
we tried for them. Also, we put in that 
UCOP, and we’ll see how that goes. But 
if we win, our members will get their 
money back.”

Green Bay gave up a whopping 50 
sacks — four times more than the 
12 sacks the Indianapolis Colts have 
under their collective belt. It is a 
good thing Bret Favre isn’t at the 
helm in Green Bay; I would hate to 
see the geriatric break a hip. If the 
Packers want to make the cheeseh-
eads happy and Lambeau-leap their 
way to a Super Bowl, they are going 
to have to cut down these lapses of 
concentration. The Packers’ New 
Year’s resolutions should be to stop 
with the brain farts, keep the yellow 
flags in the zebra’s pockets and con-
centrate on protecting the precious 
arm of Aaron Rodgers instead of 
making his life more miserable. 

Last but not least, the Arizona 
Cardinals need to get to know each 
other better. It’s not uncommon to 
see quarterback Kurt Warner launch 
the ball downfield to wide receiver 
Larry Fitzgerald, who regularly comes 
up with the ball and a touchdown. 
However, on occasion, Warner has a 
knack for passing the ball to a player 
on the wrong team. The Cardinals 
need to remember that turnovers can 

transform a successful season into 
a disappointing playoff exit.  Need 
proof? We need not look further into 
their past than last season’s Super 
Bowl. Arizona, trailing 10-7, was in 
the Pittsburgh red zone with only 18 
seconds until halftime. Then, in a 
moment of madness, Warner tossed 
the ball into the end zone, Pittsburgh 
Steelers linebacker James Harrison 
came up with the ball and returned it 
for pick-six. The Steelers took a 17-7 
lead on that play, en route to their 
eventual 27-23 victory. Will the past 
come back to haunt the Cardinals? As 
of now, the Cardinals have a negative-
five turnover differential, meaning 
they’ve given up five more turnovers 
than they’ve forced. In comparison 
the Packers — the Cardinals’ likely 
Wild Card opponent - have a turn-
over differential of plus-22. That 
means the Cardinals must resolve 
to be a little less generous. Come on 
guys — Christmas is over already.

With that, I conclude the NFL 
team resolution list. Let’s hope they 
take a word from the wise — it’s the 
only way they’ll have a legitimate 
chance at lifting the Lombardi Trophy.

the second night in a row.
UCSD trailed 60-58 with 2:24 

left, but Ilg came up with a steal and 
hit a short jumper to tie the score; 
Carlisle then sank her third three-
pointer of the game to push the 
Tritons ahead.

UCSD also bagged 13 points from 
Hunter, who led the team with seven 
rebounds. CSUDH had three scor-
ers in double figures, but fell to a 3-7 
overall season record with the loss. 
The game was tight throughout, seeing 
13 lead changes and 12 ties before the 
Trtins emerged victorious.

Carlisle’s clutch weekend was a con-
tinuation of an already outstanding 
season.   She is currently the leading 
Triton scorer, averaging 18.5 points per 
game. The sophomore guard has also 
been a consistent team leader in steals, 
assists and playing time.

The Tritons will take a shot at 
extending their record winning 
streak on Thursday, with a CCAA 
home opener against Chico State. 
The game  starts at 5:30 p.m. in 
RIMAC Arena.

the field and adding 10 of 13 free 
throws, along with four rebounds and 
three assists. After just six weeks of 
season play, he reached double figures 
in four straight games. Senior guard 
Tyler Acevedo added eight points to 
the score, while junior and freshman 
guards Casey Ryan and Jake Tarabilda 
collected an additional seven points 
apiece. 

Chris Fields led the Golden Eagles 
with 18 points — 16 of which were 
scored in the first half of the game — 
and five rebounds.

With just 14 minutes left in the sec-
ond half, Lawley sunk two free throws, 
pulling the Tritons within ten at 38-28. 
The Eagles responded by pushing their 
lead to 20 on a three-pointer with eight 
minutes left on the clock. 

Over the following six minutes, 
the Tritons put together a 10-2 run to 
reach 45-55. But the late surge was not 
enough for the Tritons: CSULA held 
tight for the final two minutes to take 
the win at 62-53. 

LA shot at 42 percent throughout 
the game, outscoring the Tritons 26-14 
on free throws. Though the Eagles 
also won the battle of the boards — 
out-rebounding the Tritons 50-24 — 
UCSD has been the better rebounder 
among five of six of its last opponents. 

Though the loss was disappointing 
after such a big win, Lawley said he 
likes what he has seen from his team in 
the recent weeks.

“Seeing our progress over the past 
few games and practices has made 
me extremely hopeful for the heart 
of league play,” Lawley said. “I look 
forward to getting ‘W’s in front of our 
Triton home crowd.”

The Tritons tried to right their ship 
in CCAA play on a trip to Carson, 
Calif., where they took on Cal State 
Dominguez Hills at the Torodome. 
However, their losing trend continued 
for a 55-67 fall. The Toros improved 
to 2-7 overall and 2-2 in CCAA play, 

while the Tritons fell to 2-6 overall and 
1-4 in conference.

The game was knotted up at 39-38 
with 14 minutes left in the second half, 
at which point Dominguez Hills took 
the lead and never looked back. 

Lawley, the only Triton to reach 
double figures, sank five of his 13 shots 
from the field and 11 of 12 from the 
freethrow line. Christian Hatch added 
nine points to the cause, while Jake 
Tarabilda and Dylan Bohanan scored 
eight points apiece. The Toros out-

scored the Tritons 17-1 on second- 
chance points, which ultimately proved 
to be the difference in the game.

The Tritons look to turn their record 
around upon returning home to host 
Chico State and Cal State Stanislaus 
in next weekend’s conference games. 
Before that, UCSD will entertain the 
Wildcats in its CCAA home opener on 
Thursday evening at 7:30 p.m.

THIS DAY IN HISTORY
In 1980, President Jimmy Carter 
announced U.S. intentions to boycott
the Moscow Summer Olympics
as a statement of protest against the 
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. 

The sophomore point guard scored a season-high 28 
points — two shy of her career high — in UCSD’s win 
over Cal State Dominguez Hills. She leads the Tritons in 
scoring, with an average of 18.5 points per game.

MEN’S BASKETBALL — After a difficult 0-4 
start to this season, the UCSD men’s basketball 
picked up its game with two wins over winter 
break. On Dec. 22, the Tritons took their first 
league win of the season: a decisive 64-49 vic-
tory over San Diego Christian College at RIMAC 
Arena. However, they were subsequently hum-
bled in the new year, falling 52-63 to Cal State Los 
Angeles on Jan. 2, then again 55-67 to Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on Jan. 3. UCSD now stands 2-6 
overall and 1-4 in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play. 

Senior guard Jordan Lawley has anchored the 
Triton offense and tallied 20 points in UCSD’s 
home opener against San Diego Christian College, 
connecting on seven of his 14 from the field and 
five of six from the freethrow line. Sophomore 
center Christian Hatch lent seven points and 
seven rebounds, while freshman forward Justin 
Brue gave the Tritons a much-needed boost once 
he got off the bench — scoring six points and 
pulling down 11 rebounds.

UCSD put up a solid defense throughout the 
game, preventing SDCC from sneaking easy bas-
kets and forcing them to shoot 31 percent from the 
field. The Hawks managed only eight field goals 
and a mere 28 percent of their attempted field 

goals in the first half. The Tritons took advantage 
of the Hawks’ slow start by sinking a stellar 40 
percent of their shots, or 22 of 55 attempts. 

After SDCC’s first five points, the Tritons went 
on a 12-point tear, taking a seven-point lead with 
12 minutes left in the first half. Brue topped off 
the run with two jumpers, bringing the score to 
12-7. The Tritons kept their foot on the pedal, 
accumulating a 28-13 advantage with less than 
four minutes left in the half. The team stormed 
into halftime with a 32-20 lead.

The Tritons started the second half where they 
left off, going on a 14-7 run to reach their greatest 
lead of the game, at 46-27. Though the Hawks ral-
lied back with nine straight points pulling within 
10 points of the Tritons — though they were 
unable to cut into their deficit further, and Lawley 
sealed the UCSD victory with six straight points.

Brue nailed a jump shot that gave the Tritons 
a 16-point lead, giving way to a a 64-49 victory. 

Despite his team’s 20-point victory, Lawley 
said he felt “The game against SD Christian 
wasn’t our best performance, but it definitely 
reassured me that we are taking progressive steps. 
We did a lot of positive things on the offensive 
and defensive ends of the court, but I still feel like 
we need to make our big men more of a presence 
throughout the game.”

UCSD hit the road for more conference play 
as they took on Cal State Los Angeles on Jan. 
2. Lawley scored 24 points — a team and game 
high — but his personal victory wasn’t enough 
to contain the Golden Eagles, who had won five 
of their last six games.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL —�Two wins over the 
weekend placed the 2009-10 women’s basketball 
team at No. 1 in UCSD’s record books.

Spending their last two days of winter break 
on the road, the Tritons recorded close wins 
against Cal State Los Angeles and Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, with a combined two-game 

victory margin of only nine points. The wins 
extended the Triton streak to 10 — the first time 
in university history. 

On Saturday, the Tritons defeated CSULA 
65-61. With only 1:08 remaining in a tied game, 
sophomore pointguard Chelsea Carlisle capital-
ized on an LA turnover and sank a three-pointer, 
handing UCSD the lead for the rest of the match.

Carlisle and junior forward Tiffany Hunter 
led the team with 15 points a piece, with senior 
guard Annette Ilg adding 10 points. Despite a 
poor shooting night, the Tritons held on for 
the victory: UCSD shot just 38 percent from 
the field, but made 35 percent from beyond the 
arc. On the other hand, LA shot over 50 percent 
from the field and outrebounded the Tritons 
40-32, but only took four freethrow shots — 

compared to 19 from the Tritons.    
The Golden Eagles were led by junior for-

ward Jordan Kuzma, who put in 15 points. 
Overall, though, fell to 2-7 overall keeping them 
winless in league play. 

The Tritons continued their streak with a 
69-64 victory over CSU Dominguez Hills on 
Sunday. Carlisle once again led the way, totaling 
a 28-point season high — two points short of 
her career high. Though the Tritons came out 
slowly, trailing by as many as 11 in the first half 
and five at halftime, they took advantage of  the 
Toros’ mistakes to score 20 points off turnovers. 
Carlisle scored seven of the Tritons’ final nine 
points, including a go-ahead three-pointer for

With a new year comes new hope for a fresh start. That is, except for the sol-
diers of the gridiron in the National 
Football League. With Super Bowl 
XLIV a mere month away, the start 
of 2010 signals the end for most NFL 
teams’ runs — with the exception of 
one very worthy team.

As the playoffs begin, even 
upper-echelon teams need to tighten 
their game. So, just as any average 
Joe makes New Year’s resolutions at 
the start of January, I propose the 
following strategies for NFL teams to 
kick their bad habits and earn a bid 

at this year’s Super Bowl.
 First on my list are the San 

Diego Chargers, who need to kick 
their procrastination habits. San 
Diego has had an unnerving habit 
of not killing off opponents early 
enough in games, and relying on 
narrow last-second victories. In a 
Week One match against the paltry 
Oakland Raiders, San Diego was 
lucky to eke past with a touchdown 
only 18 seconds before the end of 
the game. In Week Nine, with fewer 
than 30 seconds on the clock, the 
Chargers scored the game-winning 
touchdown to beat the New York 
Giants by a point, and it took a field 
goal with only three seconds on the 
clock to beat the Cincinnati Bengals 
in Week 14. I could go on forever 
about the Chargers’ late-game hero-
ics, but I’ve got a word count to 
worry about here. So let’s just say 
if the Chargers want to pass the 
ultimate Super Bowl exam, they are 
going to have to be sharp from the 
first blow of the whistle to the last. 
We the students could even learn 
a thing or two from the Chargers: 
Waiting until the last second is not 
worth the risk.

Maybe it’s a combination of the 
jet lag and aging players, but the 
New England Patriots have had a 
hard time adapting to away-game 
environments. Coming into this 
weekend’s match, the Patriots sport 
an outstanding 8-0 home record. But, 
as impressive as they are at home, 
they are equally disappointing on 
the road, accumulating a 2-5 record 
in games outside the Northeast. 
This season, New England has failed 
to prove they have what it takes to 
win abroad — their only road wins 
came against the lowly Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers and the mediocre Buffalo 
Bills. Fortunately for them, they will 
host one of the Wild Card games. 
However, should they advance, a road 
game in the Divisional Round of the 
playoffs against either the Chargers 
or the Indianapolis Colts awaits. The 
Patriots have to get tougher on the 
road, or go home for good.

Everyone deserves a chance after 
an honest mistake. But the Green 
Bay Packers have asked for one too 
many second chances, and expect 
automatic forgiveness. Having col-
lected a league-leading 114 penal-
ties as the regular season comes to 
a close, the Green Bay Packers are 
pushing their luck. They also lead 
the league in another dubious stat 
they shouldn’t be too proud of: sacks 
allowed. Heading into this weekend,
