Picture ID Cards May 
Be Issued at UCSD 

by Laura kerl 
If student approval is gained, 

UC an Diego will have tamper-
proof picture ID cards by next 
fall. The cards will be of the arne 
type as in present use at San 
Diego State, according to 

Registrar Ron Bowker 

False Data 
Group 

at UCSD 
A UC San Diego chapter of a 

national organization dedicater' 
to in itiating "interest, research, 
and Increased awareness in the 
Mea of the use of false reports by 
police agencies" has formed . 

Andrew Fleisher, chairman of 
the campus chaptN , says he wi ll 
soon schedule a meeting of the 
group, called t he National 
Commission on Law En-
forcement and Social Reform . 

The regiona l chairman of the 
organizatio n told the Triton 
Times that his organization felt 
that there is a significant degree 
of either incorrect or misused 
Information in files that private 
citizens are not allowed to see. 
"We want to find out how 
rampant this law breaking is," he 
said, adding that the group is in 
contact with Massachusetts 

nator Edward Kennedy and 
other members of Congres . 

He aid K nnedy is currently 
condu ting a similar in-
ve tigation . 

He said the commission is not 
connected with the Fifth Estate, a 
counterint II igence agency .

Assistant Business Manager Donn 
O'Neill. The cards will be made of 
plastic and will contain the 
student 's name and Social 
Se urity number in raised em-
'bossing . 

535,000 
The project will cost from $1 .00 

to $1 .50 per tudent, at a total 
cost of $35,000. 

According to a report made to 
the Chancellor by O'Neill and 
Registrar Ronald Bowker, much 
time cou ld be saved in numerous 
campus offices and departments. 
The cards would be of most use to 
the library , where students 
wouldn't have to fill out book 
cards, in the Financial Aids office, 
the Cashier's offices, and the 
bookstore. 

Students and staff would 
probably need to be 
photographed only once, since 
the cards have a life expectancy 
of four years . Deca ls would be 
attach d to the card for each 
quarter that the student is 
registered and has paid fees . The 

ards for staff members would be 
validated annuallv. 

At the present time, the Health 
Center ees no use that would 
exceed that of the present paper 
10 cards, but Bowker is confident 
that a "Kaiser-type plan could be 
implemented in future ad-
missions" to save time for both 
students and Health center staff . 

For students on the meal plan, 
a magnetic strip, identical to that 
of the present meal card, would 
be in erted . 

No State Funds 
The total cost of the I D cards 

would amount to about $35,000. 
McElroy commented, " I doubt 
whether it (the funding of the 
cards) would be legally possible 
throl!gh state funds ." 
- The funding of the cards, then, 
would have to come from the 
individual students . According to 
the proposal , their cost would 
amount to $ 1.50 for students with 
a meal plan and $1 .00 for those 
without . 

McElroy feels a tudent 
ommittee would be the most 

effective way to obtain student 
approval. lincoln Cushing, co-
editor of CAPE, feels a student 
questionnaire card included in 
the Spring quarter registration 
packets wou ld be best.

Coop Elects 4 Members to 
BR Group for 'Balance' 

In the culmination of much of 
the discussion and tension the 

tudent Cooperative has ex-
perienced since its first regular 
meeting four months ago, four 
members were elected Monday 
to the Coop' budget organ to 
balance any " racial , ethnic, or 
, xual " deficiencies that exist 
among the four members 
chosen by the co lleges. 

Revelle students Oscar 
Mareno and Bert Lee, Muir 
tudent Ann Carberry, and Third 

Gina Capaldo 

student and MECHA chair-
person , Irma Munoz were 
elected from a field of 12 
tudents, nominated at Mon-

day's meeting and on January 
13. 

The college members, who 
have served on the Budget 
Resources Group (BRG) for most 
of this year, are Alex Needleman 
of Fourth, Selma Blake of Third, 
and Steve Pettich of Muir. The 
Revelle College Council is 
searching for a member to 
represent Revelle . 

Breakdowns for the com-
mittee, including coordinator 
Rudy Luque, are one Asian-
American , one black, three 
Chicanos, and three whites .â€¢ 

Compromise 
The procedure of electing 

four at-large members from the 

BRG Coordinator Rudy Luque collects ballots Monday . 
Coop m mbership was devised 
after some complained that the 
BRG was not representative of 
the interests of the whole un-
dergraduate comm un ity . 
Original motions involved 
poolings of representatives from 
the student organizations 
eligib le to receive Coop money, 
and quota systems for -the 
representation of women and 
minorities. The present system 
was approved following a 
compromise last quarter bet-
ween the !.everal dissenting 
factions of the Coop. Two of the 
Coop's most radical and out-
spoken members, Montgomery 
Reed of the Radical Education 
Project and Tom T'anana of the 
Young Americans for Freedom, 
who have often found them-
elves at odds during Coop 
essions, were defeated in bids 

for seats on the BRG. Their 
respective statements before the 

lection were the most involved 
of any pre ented . 

Tenana said he felt the 
committee and the Coop as a 
whole were slanted to the left, 
and said he would provide 
co nservative input and a 
" different philosophy" for 
looking at budget requests . 

Reed responded that uch 

would be ''' pseudo-
egalitarianism," and aid the 
Coop should deal with " what we 
know is the right philosophy and 
do what is necessary " 

"Catered To" 
Another unsuccessful can-

didate, Revelle student Gina 
Ca paldo , said she thought 
minorities were being catered to 
in the Cooperative She aid, 
" There have b en times when 
the debate was supposed to end 
that a black was allowed to 
speak when I know I would be 
told to sit down and shut up " 

In other action, the Coop 
voted to allow local external 
coordinator Marco Li Mandri to 
represent the body at the 
m tings of the La Jolla Plan-
ning Commission, the next 
meeting of which IS chedul d 
for Saturdav ct Revelle 

In addition , there was 
discussion of the possibility of 
sending one or two represen-
tatives of the Coop to the 
conference on raci m on 
February 14 in Boston . It IS 
estimated that the trip would 
require from $300 to $750

hose Who laugh Have Not Yet Heard the Terrible News 
by Ric:hoIrd N.deau 

As the American nation approaches its 
200th birthday, it finds its people in an 
angry, confused, anxious, and 
dissillussioned frame of mind. The 
unprecedented political upheavals of 
1974 - the fall of Agnew and Nixon and 
the rise of Ford and Rockerfeller - have 
been exacerbated by what is rapidly 
developing into a major economic crisis. 
As Americans apprehensively read 'their 
newspapers and listened to their T .V. sets 
on New Years Day, they were faced with 
the news of lengthening unemployment 
I ines, racial violence, further inflationary 
price increases, the prospect of another 
"energy crisis," and a further erosion of 
Kissinger's tinker toy " the structure of 
peace" in the Middle East and in 
Southeast Asia. This type of news was 
itself topped by the human interest story 
of the elderly who were buying and 
eating cat food because their retirement 
incomes and their food stamps had been 
wh Ittled away by galloping inflation and 
then frozen by a desperate and callous 
federal administration . 

So far, the government's attempts at 
r ctlfying this economic and political 
in tability have been about a effective 
a a "snowball In helL" One such 

~nowball, which cannot but help to 
increase political CYniCiSm, is the 
president's recently appointed blue-
ribbon panel, headed by Nelson 
Rockerfeller, wh ich has been allegedly 
et up to "investigate" the C.I A . Tom 

Wicker of the New York Times (jan , 7) 
has amply captured this mood of 
cynicism with the comment " It looks 
suspiciously like a goat set to guard a 
cabbage patch . Having th C.I A. in-
vestigated by such a group is like having 
the Mafia audited by its own ac-
countants." 

The most recent snowball is President 
r ord's new econom ic-energy program 
which can be summarized asÂ· a not too 
cI ver attempt of "robbing Peter to pay 
Paul" In an attempt to put more money 
into the pockets of the American people, 
the program calls for ; a $12 billion tax 
cut for individuals to be distributed 
through rebates ; an additional per-
manent tax cut amounting to an 
estimated $165 billion reduction in 
individual income taxes and a six billion 
rut tor corporations; and the imposition 

of a S2 a barrel levies on domestic and 
imported crude oil, which is expected to 
raise the price of gasoline to about 15c 
more per gallon . In addition, the 
President has asked for a five year 
moratorium on emission control stan-
dards and a one year moratorium on new 
federal program spending, as ~II as 
emergency powers to ration gasoline and 
other petroleum products . There was no 
mention of a moratorium on corporate 
profits. 

This program is doomed to failure , To 
use Senator Henry Jackson's metaphor 
"its like shuffling around the deck chairs 
on the Titanic ." It may even exacerbate 

the crisis since it does not even begin to 
attack the major source of inflation -
corporate profits - and puts an added 
burden on the average consumer who 
will have to pay higher gasoline and 
home heating prices. It Â· also does ab-
solutely nothing to alleviate the chronic 
unemployment situation which is ac-
tually much more serious than the 
picture presented by the government's 
official unemployment statistics. 

A wounded beast is a dang rous 
animal , especially when it feels cornered. 
The present chest beatings of Ford and 
Kissinger in regards to the "Arabs" and 

the North Vietnamese are indications 
that the beast will not go down without a 
fight . What is even more frightening is 
that these chest beatings have occurred 
within the larger context of general 
economic and political insecurity and 
confusion . A counter-revolution also 
seems to be taking place at many levels 
in American society ; in the mass media 
with its glorification of the police 
(looking at television one could easily be 
led into believing that the police con-
stitute two-thirds of the American 
population) and people in positions of 
authority; in the universities where the 
major constraints upon " radical 

prof ssor " is impo ed by the students 
themselves; in the youth culture which 
app ars to have degenerated into a 
pathetic and pathological amalgam of 
lost souls in ~earch for a Guru ; and in the 
great middlE' class "silent majority" who 
in its insecurity and fear may opt for a 
strong arm d "populist " I ike George 
Wallac " to clean it all up." 

And then , of course, there is the 
American Left which seems more 
fragm nted than Humpty Dumpty as its-
constituents claw themselves to pieces 
over sectarian argument~ as to whether 
or not Stalin, Mao, or Marcuse has the

miasma of confusion is the Leviathan

Surely, as Bertold Brecht once wrote, 
" those who laugh have not yet heard the

out for the American people. The picture 
painted here is admittedly a rather bleak 
one - it is a picture of a society riddled 
with contradictions and festering with ' 
decay; a society that wastes millions of 
dollars on ludicrous quiz shows and 
shiny useless gadgets of every sort while 
increasing numbers of peopl find

Edward Simons is on vacation. 

My good friend, Mrs. Charles G. Hood, last week invited me to 
the house party she held last night to celebrate her purchase of an 
old Tudor style home in Coronado. In last week's column, you'll 
remember I predicted the party would be a success, despite Mrs. 
Hood's recent radical hysterectomy. 

Mrs. Etleen 

Mrs. Hood was certainly All 
Woman at her party, which in-
cluded Mr. and Mrs. William B. 
Jacks, Mr. and Mrs. Harvey J . 
Stokes, Mr. and Mrs. Jerald Dye, 
and Mr. Robert "Bob" Darend, 
Coronado's most eligible bachelor. 
The house, which Mrs. Hood has 
dubbed "Billy" after her eldest 
son, who surfs in Del Mar for a 
living, was very nice. Mr. and Mrs. 
John C. Davis, Mrs. George 
Woodcock, and Mr. and Mrs. 
James Willcox all said so. 

Speaking of Bob Darend, you will aU be plea'ied to know that his 
recent "trouble" with his secretary has been resolved, thanks to 
the eminent skill of Dr. Wilbur Jackson, of Pacific Beach's Free 
Clinic . He says he is now on the move again, and hopes to soon 
buy his sailboat back , which he so mysteriously sold three weeks 
ago. 

Mr. and Mrs. Bruce V. McDirdle today celebrate the thirtieth 
anniversary of their dog's death. Their dead dog, Beau, has been 
dead thirty years. As usual, the party will feature Beau (who was 
stuffed by La Jolla's leading taxidermist, Mr, Jansen) as the 
motif. Fur coats are encouraged, as are dead cats, which will be 
placed at Beau's feet during the ceremony. Beau, as you will 
remember, was an avid cat fancier . Two guests, Mr. and Mrs. 
Rollo Pierce, told me that they will arrive at the party dressed as 
dogs, to augment the dog motif. Discreet soundings of other 
prominent guests suggest the idea has met with a lot of positive 
response. 

One of 'La Jolla 's more beautiful homes, " Hilldale." was 
treated to a rare occurrence last night, this reporter has learned. 
Mrs. Norm~n Fields, who owns Hilldale, apparently bought some 
terrible drinks for her guests. She asked me to explain the 
reasons for last nillht's faux pas and apologize to all involved. 

According to Mr. and Mrs, Bill Jones, of San Diego's Southeast 
side, the liquor, which they had imported from Scotland, wasn't 
too good, The Jones' own " Logan St. Liquor, Beer, and Wine ." 

At the fateful party were Mr. and Mrs. Jonathan B. Kelly, Mr. 
and Mrs. J .B. Harris, Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Ellis, Dr. and Mrs. 
Brian M. Fischer, Councilman and Mrs. Harold N. Olvay, Bookie 
and Mrs. Richard E . Bascomb, Mr. and Mrs. J ,J . Barrett, Mrs. 
Albert Quinn, Mr, and Mrs. Franklin Miller Herbert, Mr. and 
Mrs. Philip J . Thomas, Mr. and Mrs. Edward E. Gregory, Mrs. 
and Mr. Anne J . Richet, Mr. Anthony Chadwick, Mrs. Kirk N. 
Logan, and Mrs. William B. Perkins. They all got violently 
nauseous and proceeded to vomit aU over the superb French 
cuisine, which was prepared by San Diego's foremost chef, 
Marcel, and which was served on Mrs. Fields' beautiful antique 
China, which her long dead mother, Phyllis,. brought with her 
when she fled from Atlanta, Georgia, in 1954. It is a beautiful set, 
as all the guests commented, and is valued well in the neigh-
borhood of $10,000 . 

Mrs. Fields asked me to say she is extremely sorry for the 
occurrence, and is suing Mr. and Mrs. Bill Jones for damages. 

San Diego society turned out en masse Thursday night to glve 
Mr. and Mrs. George S, Scott a going away party in University 
Hospital 's posh "Crisis Ward ." The fete was attended by Mr. and 
Mrs. Joseph H. Vogler, Mr. and Mrs, Thomas B. Hanson, Mr. and 
Mrs. IgorT. Zelf, Mr. and Dr. Randolf Metz, Mr. and Mrs. James 
R. Stiller, Colonel James D. Lambert, American Ambassador to 
Texas, and Mr. Larry C. Todd. 

The theme of the party was "Death in the '70's" and featured a 
performance of Sciatica and Dropping Body Temperature by Mr. 
Scott, which was well received. The performance, which was 

d~ne in the semi-lighted darkness of the oxygen tent, was 
highlighted by the death of his wife of fifty-eight years, Matilda. 
Matilda, who kicked during the climactic ending of Mr. Scott's 
"Solilioquyon Pain in the Chest," presented the guests with a 
veritable tour-de-force as she gasped and wheezed her way to 
oblivion. 

Mr. Scott, who reacted as could be expected of a man who 
really didn't give a shit about anything anyway, merely blinked a 
couple of times, turned over on his face and died. 

Neither Mr, or Mrs. Scott ever amounted to much. 

Environmental Laws Studied at UCD 
Enactment of the National 

Environmental Policy Act in ~ )69, 
followed by the California En-
vironmental Quality Act a year 
later, was like tossing a large rock 
into a millpond. 

The ripple effects of these acts 
on established patterns of 
resources developm nt and 
management are still spreading-
in som cases they look more like 
tidal waves-to publ ic agencies 
and their attitudes toward en-
vironmental protection . 

A UC Water Resources Center 
report by Davis political scientist 
Geoffrey Wandesforde-Smith 
analyzes the Visible effects of 
these two laws on the planning 
and construction of public works 
projects affecting environmental 
values . 

On the national scene, he 
points out that judicial in-
terpretation of the NEPA so 
explicit ly specifies both the 
adm inistrative procedures to be 
followed and the basic elements 
to be considered in planning such 
projects that there no longer is 
much leeway . Government 
agencies must give en-
vironmental values and concerns 
at least equal consideration with 
engineering factors, for instance, 
when preparing pro ject reports . 

This new fact of life is being

Film: Steve Esmedlna 

Am,,,cord 
"Amarcord" means "I Remember," and it would seem that even 

the most fervent Fellini admirer must be tempted to occasionally 
yawn and mutter, "So what else is new, Federico?" All of Fellini's 
films after "8 1/2" have been cursed with what must be the 
director's fondest memorabalia. At this point, I wish Fellini would 
start forgetting so he would be forced to create rather than re-
create. For despite all of the unqualifiedly praiseworthy reviews 
"Amarcord" has received, and despite the fact that it was voted 
"Best Film of 1974" by The New York Film Critics, "Amarcord" 
strikes me as an almost complete failure: nostalgia giving headway 
to retrogression and senility . 

Fellini stopped making real movies shortly after " 8 1/2." What 
was a breakthrough for the director in that film has become his 
perennial albatross . The constant shifts between subiective fan-
tasies and obsessions with their influence on objective attitudes 
gave "8 1/2" its heightened, mystical quality, similar to Julio Cor-
tazar's short stories. The primary focus of "8 1/2" was the creative 
drain of a fictional director, said to represent Fellini . There was a 
scene in that film which capsulizes just what is wrong with 
"Amarcord": a writer hired to "assist" the director relentlessly 
criticizes the director's prepared script . He tells him " It's just 
another film about your childhood ... 1t lacks ideas, it was no 
philosophical base. It's merely a series of senseless episodes ." 
Whether or not it was conscious, and it hardly matters, this is what 
Fellini h_as concocted with "Amarcord." 

Short-Lived 
Ceramics 

by Loring Spitler 

If you have not spent the past 
week suffering from the seven-
day blink, then you may have 
been one of the few who ven-
tured down into the hole where 
the Mandeville Art Gallery is 
located and discovered a 
rewarding show of ceramics (I 
said ceramics, not 'pots'). Even I 
must admit that I was not aware 
of it until I stumbled upon it. 
Whatever I do write about it will 
be a eulogy, because, by the time 
you read this, the show will be 
closed. 

I have been attending ceramic 
shows for years, and very few 
have left me with any feelings 
other than the wish that I had 
brought along a tea bag and some 
hot water . This time for the 
unfortunately brief period of 10 
days (Jan . 8-17), John Annaloro, 
the director of the Crafts Center, 
and Dan Ganzer, an instructor for 
the Art department, had put 
together a surprisingly wor-
thwhile and satisfying display of 
pieces. 

John aid that the show was 
comprised 01 works done by 
artists from outside of the 
university environs (mainly 
people who are known to John 
and Dan in the L.A., Orange, and 
S.D. county areas), and displayed 
with the primary intent of 
demonstrating the breadth of the 
ceramic medium to the in-
digenous craftspeople. Perhaps 

this is the reason for the lack of 
publicity on the show. 

The range of subtle im -
plication, intriguing detail, 
massive innovation, and 
provocative statements produced 
by the pieces cou ld only be 
inadequately relayed or described 
within this article since the reader 
does not have the option of 
seeing and experiencing the 
works. Consequently, I only wish 

to express my appreCiation, and 
extend my respects tothoseartist 
who contributed, and e!pecially 
to John and Dan, whose efforts 
produced this fine collection . I 
regret that it was so short in 
duration, and wish to encourage 
them to repeat the performance 
at some future date. At that time, 
I hope it does not come as such a 
short lived surprise, surprises of 
this quality deserve to endure . 

At its most fundamental level , "Amarcord" is mer Iy a senseless 
series of scenes from Italianproviniciallife, circa 1935, which are 
very skimpily based around the experiences of a teenage boy, 
presumably Fellini 's surrogate. Again the director wallows in 
auterism's most glaring fallacy . "Amarcord" bursts the dam with 
Fellinisms. The man has become his own most flagrant imitator. The 
interminable procession of su ltry sirens, fat , grotesque women, 
midgets, indolent old men, rambunctious teenagers, and paper 
mache fascists all strain to evoke the erotic sensationalism of " La 
Dolce Vita," the episodic broadness of " Roma" and " The Clowns" 
and the antidramatic naturalims of Fellini 's one indisputable 
masterpiece, " I Vitelloni." Unfortunately, the mixture doesn't gel 
because Fellini piles everything on us without ever establishing a 
credible focus . The scenes involving the school boys bring to mind a 
vision of the young men in " I Vitelloni" ten years earlier, but there is 
no development. Interest in the boys wanes early in the film 
because almost every scene is constructed apart from any 
recognizable totality . We are watching set pieces that are 
gratuitously strung together . Some kind of grotesquerie is on hand 
at every turn to provide audiences who expect perpetual freak 
parades from Fellini with raucous relief. 

Concert Notes by Larry Deckel 
The omniscient narrator who pops in and out of the film at ar-

bitrary moments is one more example of Fellini 's narcissism . The 
conflicting viewpo,nts marr any effect the film might have had 
except as an auteur variety show. 

The sequential nature of " Amarcord" forces the viewer to respond 
to scenes individua lly, and there are a few lovely moments. 
Giusseppe Rottuno's photography is, as usual, clear, crystalline and 
beautiful. In recent years, it is his delicate images which have 
provided Fellini 's films with their intermittent grace. In " Amarcord," 
the seaside scenes, the boys dancing in the snow, the hollowed out 
countrysides, and the opening bonfire are all as pleasing to the eye 
as the rest of the film is unstimulating to the brain . 

The most disheartening thing about " Amarcord" is ' thdt it has 
been so well received . Many people whose opinions I ordinarily 
respect have gone so far as to ca ll this film a "masterpiece." The 
piece part is correct, but it is surely not the work of a master. Those 
of us who have grown weary of Fellini's rehashed autobiographies 
wi ll probably have to continue suffering through the director's 
torturously boring trips down memory lane.

Records: Musical Notes Larry Deckel 
RELAYER - YES, Atlantic Records 

Yes's new album is a let-Lown, plain and simple. 
Which is not to say the album isn't good, and isn't 
to say the band has lost its strength with the 
departure of Rick Wakeman (on the contrary, new 
keyboardist Patrick Moraz fits in like a glove), but 
there just isn't enough substance to get his album 
off the ground. 

The problem lies with the fact that the road to 
good intentions is often paved with bad moments. 
"Tales of Topographic Oceans" was a plateau 
which Yes had been heading for from the 
beginning. It was rock as symphony without the 
strings. It firmly established the validity of the 
extended song format and proved that length did 
not mean dreariness. 

But it can get dreary if one is not careful, and 
this is the lesson of "Relayer ." The album lacks a 
strong enough motif, a backbone, even a strong 
mUSical theme to stand on . The result is running 
the borderline between progressive-music and 
progressive-muzak. 

Too many of the old tricks, too much of Jon 
Anderson's pseudo-esoteric lyrics (" Faster 
moment spent spread tales of change within the 
sound"), cloud the sense of totality needed to 
bring this sort of music to a focus . 

The album has its moments, and Yes fans won't 
go away altogether discouraged. Some strong 
instrumental work in the center of "The Gates of 
Delirium, " and a few delicious solos in " Sound 
Chaser," keep enticing, but all in all," Relayer" just 
doesn't have the vitality needed to fulfill the 
promise of the band . 

lUST A BOY- LEO SAYER. Chrysalis Records 
Leo Sayer as lyricist, and David Courtney as 

composer, came into some American prominence 
last year when Three Dog Night recorded their 
composition "The Show Must Go On." His first 
album " Silverbird" was a big hit in Britain, and 
Sayer managed to carve out a small following in 
the States 

I must confess I'm not too familiar with Sayer, 

going on hearsay about his unique ,ound, his 
pierrot/ clown image, and yet his name cropped 
up again when Roger Daltrey recorded his "Giving 
It All Away ." 

And so I stumbled on his second album, " Just A 
Boy," and it was certainly worth the stumble 
Sayer has an unique vocal flavor, having managed 
to take the finer qualities of the upper ranges and 
falsetto, and giving it a power attack The effect 1\ 
comparable to Rod Stewart in his chOir boy day~ 
without the rocks in his mouth It is compelling 

The tunes are in that ambiguous non-
classifiable pop genre that defies labels. and yet 
the arrangements are of such a delicate nature, ~o 
carefully reduced to the minimum that the draw 1\ 
oftimes magnetic The opening number . 
"Telepath ," is perhaps the best case In POint 
merely plano embellished with specific flashes of 
strings, clipped, tight , exciti ng 

It's nice to see pop music take on such class

SCORCHING BEAUTY - IRON BUTTERflY. MCA 
Records 

Yup, another reunion . Or sort of one at least 
Erik Braunn (lead vocals/ lead guitar) and Ron 
Bushy (vocals/drums) of the original Iron But-
terfly have come back together With a n w 
keyboardist, Howard Reitzes, and a new baSSI t. 
Phil Kramer. 

The result proof that you can't go back home 
again . The original Iron Butterfly at least had 
charisma. The new Iron B has zilch 

Gone is the energy that made " In-A-Gadda-Da-
Vida" a 60's classic. Gone is the demonic bite of 
Braunn's vocals . Gone is the magic of rock's first 
extended drum solo 

What's left is an unimaginative, run of the mill . 
pop-rock stereotype. Sorry guys, but your butterfly 
sounds real rusty ..

The Q's and the Hobie Cat 
It was an odd position that I found myself in . Listening to a game 

and trying to figure out what was going on from outside the arena. 
The Q 's were playing Indiana, or some other ungodly state that the 

ABA ca lls a team , and there I was listening to the game from the press 
gate. 

There was the usual "C), Ca ldwell Jones" emitting from the PA 
system whenever "C), Caldwell Jones" scored. After about three "C), 
Caldwell lones,"'s, I figured the Q's were ahead, because CJ doesn'f 
score all the Q's points. 

But then a couple, carrying a radio, came along and I found out that 
the Q's were losing 13-10. Oh, but for the want of a few more "CJ, 
Caldwell Jones"'s. 

After finally convincing the man at the gate that I really was a 
member of the Press and did know Bruce Binkowski, the Director of 
Media and Public Relations, I was able to get into the game. 

When I got in the Q 's were actually ahead, but that didn't last very 
long, as I ndiana scored the next 8 points to take a 25-20 lead. 

UCSD Hosts 
All-Cal 
Basketball 

The UCSD Tritons will be 
hosting the AII-Cal Basketball 
Tournament on Friday and 
Saturday. Teams from Riverside, 
Davis and Irvine are expected to 
compete. 

A ction will begin Friday 
evening at 6 pm with the Aggies 
of Davis taking on the Riverside 
Highlanders. The Tritons will th~n 
meet the Irvine Anteaters in the 
feature game at 8 pm 

The losers in Friday's action 
will meet at & pm Saturday in the 
consolation game. The Cham- . 
pionship game will then be 
played at 8 pm . 

Coach Barry Cunningham feels 
his team has a chance to win if 
" the team works hard and plays 
errorl ess basketbalL" Going into 
the tourney one would have to 
rate the Triton s as the und rdog 
as Davis, Irvine and Riverside are 
all NCAA Co ll ege Division 
schools 

The second quarter went just the way the first one did with Indiana 
moving out to a 52-43 advantage, primarily on the ~oves of one 
George M cG innis. 

M cGinnis has moves. Lots of them. And he is BIG. He could 
probably be a starting tight end for most pro football teams. One just 
doesn't argue with anybody like M cGinnis, and t he Q's didn't try to . 
The Q's jllst sat by and watched in amazement as M cGi nnis ei ther 
scored one or two of his 28 points or passed off to Billy Knight for an 
easy lay-up. Knight managed to pour in 34 points wh i le everyone was 
watching McGinnis . 

Sieve Kircher shoots from behind a Paul Trainer screen in the 
Tn'ton 's recent win over Point Lama. Kircher and Trainer wtll 
lead UCSD into the All-Cal Tourney to be held here on FnÂ·day 
and Saturday. 

Th Trito ns are presently 3-1 in 
league play and 7-7 overall. They 
incurred one of their 10 se at 
Davis earlier in the season. 

Halftime featured Miss Conquistador, as she displayed her talent for 
drawing numbers out of a box. The big prize was a Hobie Cat sai lboat, 
which for some unexplicable reason was never claimed by the holder 
of the winning ticket. It's too bad . It would have been the only thing 
San Diego would have won all night.

Winter Season in Full Swing 

rebruary 8 will mark the coming of Superstars to UCSD, or, at least 
those Superstars among us will have the opportunity to be recogni zed 
as uch. 

Modeled aft er the ABC-TV Superstars specia l, the Recreation 
Department has initiated it 's own Team Superstar competition . There 
wi ll be five events, &0 yard dash, 50 yard wim, bench press, free throw 
shooting and the baseball throw for accuracy. 

Teams will be composed of five members, at least one of which must 
be of the opposite sex. With the five v nts, It i n't hard to ome to th 
concl usion that each p rson hould specia li ze in one event. 

If you are at all interest ed in showing off your Superstar status, now 
is the time to get your team togelher, practice and sign your team up 
with Harry Bloom in the Recrea tion Office.

enough teams (13) to form two leagues. Tom Stewart and his Twin 
Cheeks got things roll ing Saturday morn with a 5-0 whitewash of the 
Dolphinphloggers (or some such team). Stewart was brilli ant In the 
net , while teammate Sce lover (?) registered th e fi rst hat tr ick of thE'

vantage of four good guy (E I Chunko) errors to run up it nine run ~Ixt h

special package of services 
designed specifically for col-

College Plan, and here's what 
makes it so special: 
The College Plan 
Checking Account. 
First you get completely 
unlimited checkwriting for 
just $1 a month, (Free during 
June, July and August.) You get 
monthly statements. And the account 
stays open through the summer even 
with a zero balance, so you don't ~ 
have to close it in June, reopen it in 
the fa ll. 
Personalized College Plan Checks 
are included at a very low cost. Scenic or 
other style checks for a little more. 

BankAmericard~ Next, if you're a qualified student of 
sophomore standing or higher, you can also get 
BankAmericard. Use it for tuition at state universities, for 
check cashing identification and everyday purchases. CanÂ· 
servative credit limits help you start building a good credit 
history. 
Overdraft Protection. This part of the package helps you 

BANK OF A"ER IC A NTI SA "E"BE~ FO IC

all your checks up to a prearranged limit.

lege Plan gives you individual 
help with your banking problems. 

Usually students or recent gradu-
ates themselves, our Reps are located 

at all our major college offices and are 
easy to talk with.
