SAN FRANCISCO - UC 
officials addressed the 
problem of recruiting and 
retaining quality faculty 
because of decrusing salary 
competitivness within the 
university at the UC Regents 
meeting last Thursday. 
Officials added that minority 
faculty are bei~g tempted 
from the UC system almost 
before they arrive. In his 
opening remarks at the 
meeting, UC President Jack 
Peltason placed a high 
priority on salary increases 
for UC faculty, since the 
university has fallen behind 
comparable schools by about 
9 percent in faculty pay. 

CSU TIuatMs Vote

SAN FRANCISCO - CSU 
trustees voted last Thursday 
to ask the state for another 10 
percent increase in student 
fees next year. If the fee hike 
is adopted, in-state residents 
will be paying $1 ,740 for the 
1995-96 school year, an 
increase of $156. The fee 
increase would mark the 
doubling of fees over the last 
five years. The trustees 
implied that the only way to 
avoid the fee hikes would be 
if CSU was granted an extra 
$37 million budget allocation.

Half-Hour 
Shuttle 
TRANSPORTAnON: 
Students petition to increase 
number of Hillcrest shuttles 
By Tom Barkley 
Staff Writer 

UCSD graduate students have collected 
over 400 signatures pet itioning for half-hour 
shuttle service to the Medical Center in 
Hillcrest. 

The shuttle was cut to an hourly service 
Aug. 15 because of budget cuts sustained by 
the Medical Center, School of Medicine and 
Campus AJtemative Transportation Services, 
which share its operation costs. 

The initial cost of $300,000 service has 
been reduced to an estimated $175,000, with 
Transportation and Parking Services paying 
approximately $75,000, according to Loretta 
Sconce, financial analyst for Transportation 
and Parking Services. 

The graduate students have been col-
lected over 400 signatures after circulating 
their petition for two weeks, according to 
Communications graduate student Paul 
Fotsch, who helped initiate the petition drive 
with the Committee for a Free and Frequent 
Shuttle. 

The student-organized committee con-
sists of approximately 10 primary members, 
most of whom are graduate students, accord-
ing to Communications graduate student Nick 
Sammond. 

Along with the petition, the group distrib-
uted a flyer which argues that cutting the 
shuttle service not only hurts Hillcrest com-
muters, but also adds to the problems of 
campus parking, and will "contribute to San 
Diego's deteriorating air quality and speed 
up the environmental degradation that Trans-
portation Services is supposed to be dedi· 
cated to slowing down." 

The flyer suggests using a portion of the 
$4 million net revenue from parking permits 
to cover the $150,000 needed to restore half-
hour shuttle service. 

However, Transportation and Parking 
Services contests these figures.

GuMrlI811 Reporter 

Members of the UCSD CALPIRG 
chapter rallied Thursday against Pacific 
Bell's use of ancient forest from 
Vancouver's Clayoquot Sound to manu-
facture ita phone books. 

The 4O-minute protest wu character-
ized by chants from 20 UCSD students, 
including, -Re-use, cIon't abuse" and 
-ForaD, not phone boob." 

"We Californians have 1,700-year-

Clayoquot Sound right here in our homes 
in the form of phone books." said 
Marshall College Junior Julie Trupke. 

Nancy Swasey, manager of Media 
Relations for PacifIC Bell, responded to 
the protest, "I think it's very misleading 
for groups to protest without mentioning 
the tremendous progress that hu been 
made."

UCSD Professor Granted 
Fellowship for Ozone Study 
. Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry 

Robert E. Continetti won one of 20 fIVe-year, $500,000 
fellowships from the David and Lucile Packard founda-
tion. The Packard fellowships are awarded to support 
the scientific research of young faculty members. 

Much of Continetti's award will go toward further 
studies of ozone, a part ofthe earth 's atmosphere that 
may allow higher levels of ultraviolet radiation to reach 
the surface of the earth. 

"Even in the case of this well·studied molecule, 
there are important questions our experiments can 
answer about the fundamental process of ozone de-
struction," said Continetti. 

In one part of his research, Continetti blows apart 
molecules using pulsed laser beams and then ob-
serves what happens to the pieces. Using sophlsti· 

cated detectors, he determines the constituency of 
the pieces and how energy is partitioned among them. 

"Using the funds provided by the Packard Fellow-
ship, we will extend our studies to chemical reactions 
involving the simultaneous collision of three mol-
ecules ," Continetti said. 

"These reactions are of great importance in atmo-
spheric and combustion chemistry, but are yet to be 
studied in great depth due to the technical difficulty of 
the necessary experiments, ' he added. 

UCSD Will Pay $808,400 to 
Settle Discrimination Suit 

It was announced Friday that UCSD will settle 
federal charges that jobs and promotions were denied 
to 28 qualified women and minorities by awarding 
$608,400 to the plaintiffs. 

The settlement will be split among the applicants 
with payments ranging from $1,000 to $25,000 per 
person. 

After a two-and-a-half·year study of employment 
practices at UCSD, the U.S. Department of Labor 
found that the university did not fully consider the 
applicants, who applied for jobs In 1990 and 1991. 

The settlement was part of a 12-page agreement 
that requires UCSD to implement a number of improve-' 
ments initiated by Chancellor Richard AtkinSon last 
December. 

The document requires UCSD to carry out such 
measures as improving training for management to 
help ensure compliance with federal hiring standards 
and providing greater monitoring of hiring practices on 
campus. 

The agreement cites Instances of discrimination in 
various departments at UCSD, including Business 
Affairs, Academic Affairs, the School of Medicine and 
the Medical Center. However, UCSD does not admit to 
any wrongdoing in the agreement.

The decision fully protects 34 
percent ofaayoquot Sound and sets 
aside 21 percent as Special Man-
agement Areas, with priorities on 
protection of wildlifc habitats, rec-
reational opportunities and scenic 
values, 

According to Swasey, Pacific 
Bell will not terminate its contract 
with Macmillan Bloedell, the log-
ging company which provides Pa-
cific Bell with wood pulp from the 
Clayoquot Sound. 

"What our job is as a company is 
to look at the companies we do busi-
ness with and ask ourselves, 'Do 
they abide by the law? Are they 
ethical?' After looking at the evi-
dence, wc'vc found that Macmillan 
Bloedell shares our commitment to 
tbe environment," he said. 

Swasey said that Macmillan 
Bloedcll provides Pacific Bell with 
pulp that is 40 percent recycled, the 
highest of any telephone directory. 

Swasey added, "No one would 
want to see a telephone directory 

that is 100 percent recycled. Re-
cycled paper is thicker and would 
rault in having to put out six phone 
books instead of three.· 

However, Roosevelt College 
Senior Adam Boucher responded, 
"I'd rather have six phone books in 
my house knowing that it was 100 
percent RCycled paper tban having 
three that made me directly related 
to t~ destruction that is happening 
in British Columbia. " 

Boucher added that the wood 
pulp. "Doesn't havc to come from 
an ancient foresl. It can come from 
tree farms or other sources .. . be-
cause when you cut into an ancient 
forest, you're cutting into a delicate 
ecosystem. " 

During the rally, Boucher also 
accused the British Columbian gov-
ernmcnt of purchasing 50 million 
shares of Macmillan Bloedell stock 
10 days before granting permits to 
the company for logging in 
Clayoquot Sound. 

"This kind ofpolitics is illegal in 
the United States. We, as United 
States citizens, cannot get directly 
involved in British Columbian poli-
tics. But we can, as customers and 
consumers, demand that Pacific Bell 
no longer make us a part of this 
destruction." Boucher said.

4'be flyer portrayed the money 
[from parking) as just sitting in a 
pot, • said Shuttle Driver Supervi-
sor Frank Buono. "There are other 
expenses, such as debt service, 
which the money is already covcr-
ing.-

According to Sconce, the $4 
million figure "doesn't even begin 
to cover costs after paying for op-
erating expenses." Besides $2.8 
million in debt service, Sconce 
pointed to additional costs of 
$620,817 for the campus parking 
shuttle and $830,650 for construe· 
tion. 

However, Sconce agreed that 
thcre is probably enough money to 
covcrthecostof a half-hour shuttlc. 
"Thc biggest obstacle is not 
whether the money is there, but 
whether people who park on cam-
pus should subsidize people's free 
ride from the medical systcm. " she 
said. 

"We bad meetings with [Direc-
tor ofTransportation and Parking) 
Greg Snee, and he has been sympa-
thetic. He's very much in favor of 
tbe shuttlc, but doesn't trunk it's 
feasiblc to take the money from 
people who drive to campus, Fotch 
said. 

Fotsch agreed that the main 
problem was political and said, 
"Trying to convince those inchargc 
that permit payers would be will-
ing to pay for something that 
wouldn't benefit them." 

He added, howevcr, that he be-
lieves they would be willing, be-
cause a half-hour shuttle would re-
duce parking on campus. 

However, Buono argued that it 
would be unfair to use parking funds 
to "pay for a cenain percentage of 
people's needs. If you do that you 
should maybe pay for people com-
ing from other parts of town." 

Fotsch disagreed and said that 
the cut hurt many UCSD commut-
ers who moved to Hillcrest be-
cause of the shuttle service. "The 
Hillcrest shuttle is unique because 
of its connection to the Medical 
Center," he said. "A whole com-

NEWS 3 

munity of UCSD faculty, staff and 
students havc already developed 
there." 

Fotsch said he plans to take the 
issuc to the next Transportation 
Policy Committee meeting, which 
advises the administration on 
policy. The meeting has yet to be 
scheduled. 

According to figures collected 
by Buono. between the first day of 
classes on Sept. 19 and Oct. 14, a 
total of 334 riders were left behind 
by the shuttle. 

"Thc numbers are not as large 
as I thought they would be," Buono 
said, pointing out that based on last 
year's average of 850 riders per 
day, the number of displaced could 
have been as high as 425 per day. 
The figures, however, may not in-
clude riders who have seen long 
lines and have left before the shuttle 
arrived. 

"For Transportation and Park-
ing services, leaving people be-
hind is always bad," Buono said. 
"Other sources of money and other 
issues still need to be discussed. 
Unfortunately, as we talk about it, 
people are still being left behind."

O nNov.S,CalifOrnilm will have the oppor-tunity to secure tan-
gible improvements in medical care 
and lead the nation in health-are re-
form. Proposition 186, written by • 
wide spectrum of health<&re profes-
sionals, would establish a single-
payer, health-care system covering 
all Californians and reducing to(aJ 
medical costs. To understand Propo-
sition 186, it is useful to examine the 
debate on national health-care re-
fonn. 

The Clinton Administration's 
health-care reform eliminated the 
single-payer option in its early stages 
of formulation: The administration 
concluded that a single-payer sys-
tem was not a political reality. This 
shifted the focus of debate from re-
fonning medical care, so that uni-
versal coverage could be attained, to 
an argument over who would get 
stuck with the bill. 

This was no mere tactical error. 
The problem stems from the fact that 
universal health care isan essentially 
progressive goal and cannot be 
achieved by the private sedor. At-
tempts to provide universal cover-
age, while containing costs, can only 
succeed when profit is not the linch-
pin of the system. Universal health 
care will only be achieved when 
those who can afford medical 
care cover those who cannot. If 
we eliminate the cost of sup-
porting insurance-industry profits 
and inefficiencies, the total cost for 
everyone would decrease, Such. system 
is mdistributive, and everyone would be 
better served IS • result. 

The impasse on national reform keeps 
us where we were in 1992: increasingly . 
losing health coverage, being stuck in unsatis-
factory jobs for fear of losing coverage and 
facing spiraling medical inflation. Medical in-
flation, if unchecked, threatem to drive govern-
mental deflCitc, and suffocate both the public 
and priv.te sedorE. 

Nearly every other Western industrialized 
nation bas some form of universal health cover-
age. Despite the United Statca' much-touted 
lead in medical techaoloiY and innovation, we 
are not even in the top 10 by such buic criteria

But Qinlbn's move, though a p0-

He knew, as many Americans know, 
that Adam Smith's principles of the 
"unfettered market" are disasterous 
when appl ied to such basic human needs 
as health care. According to Census 
Bureau statistics, last year 38.9 million 
Americans were without any coverage 
whatsoever; six million of whom reside 
in California. And these numbers are 
going nowhere but up. 

Well, there isn ' t 
enough money to both

decide which side 
you're on. And basi-

Principle Author of Proposition 186 have that person 

Taking its cue from the fledging 
national debate, a group of health-
care experts, headed by UCSF physi-
cian Vishu Lingappa, drafted the 
Health Insurance Act (Proposition 
186), a single-payer plan which prom-
ises to provide comphensive health 
coverage to every Californian. If 
passed, the proposition would over-
throw the health-insurance industry 
and funnel premium money into the 
tax system, saving Californians $40 
billion per year, according to propo-
nents. 

Last Friday we had the opportu-
nity to interview Dr. Lingappa, the 
proposition's principle author, at 
Grossmont Hospital in San Diego, 
where he hadjust finished speaking to 
- and debating with - doctors, ad-
ministrators and other healthcare pro-
viders about Proposition 186. 

Aa - introduction, ..... 
........ 01 PropHItIon18l? 

We started writing this proposi-
tion about two years ago, because we 
had a bad feeling about Washington, 
that it wasn't going to happen there. 
Why? Because the insurance industry 
has bought and paid for as many con-
gress people that they need [to block 
health<are reform]. 

So we expected that Clinton's plan 
would fail. First, becauseofthe power 

industry. That's not 
what it's there for. Let 
them go sell orange juiceorlV selsor 
whatever they want, but health care is 
different from other commodities be-
cause its something very personal, 
very specia~ for all of us. So that was 
the origin of it. 

A key thing we had realized over 
tbe last few years is the amount of 
money the insurance industry wastes . 
It's the amount of money that would 
cover not only all of the uninsured, but 
would improve the benefits of evory-
one who ha insurance now .... 

If your parents ended up in a nurs-
ing home, they would spend aU of 
their assets down, until they got to 
poverty, to pay for the nursing home. 
Medicaredoesn'toovernursing-home 
costs .... It's crazy to be bankrupting 
our people for something like that-
that 's a health-care thing. 

The Canadians cover nursing-
home care. And 1 made the point 
during my talk [at Grossmont Hospi-
tal] that this is not to defend every-
thing about the Canadian system, it 
has its problems. But the biggest rea-
son it hu its problems is that Canadi-
ansarespending40pm:entlessmoney

But they cover all of their people, 
we only cover one in five. They cover

the best expertise we could find in 
crafting this plan. 

We spent a lot of time aking about

First, some things in government

elected, so they are 
ICCIOUntable .... And you say to that 
penon, "You are responsible for both 
balancing the budget and providing 
the benefils;" so he couldn't just say, 
"Great, I'll provide everything, you 
worry about paying for it." 

So [there is] aneIccted health com-
missioner. (The opposition caUs it a 
czar - an elected czar, that's an oxy-
moron.) That elected individual is IC-
countable to the people. Who is the 
board of directors of an insurance 
wmpanyaccountable [to]? Patients? 
Not a chance. Doctors? No way. To 
stockholders. ... 

The only thing that will change 
that is to say, "Wait a minute, this is 
ourhealtlH:aresystem ... ltsmuld meet 
ourneods, not the insurance industry's 
needs." So we cut them out, the $20 
billion they wate .... 

. You hear about, "Well, gee, this is 
going to be a temb1e economic bur-
den." Oh yeah? Two out of three busi-
nesses pay health benefits for their 
employees now. They pay an average 
of 11 pm:entofpayroll. The one out of 
three which don't - tile IIIIIlI busi-

don't provide bealtb beaefils. .. (be-
cause] it wouIdClOlt 15 or 20 pen:eatof

And we say, let us raise, in taxes, 
the same amount of money we are 
paying in premiums now. So, taxes go 
up by $40 billion, premiums go down 
by $40 billion. The amount of money 
raised in the first year, if this plan 
passed, is the same amount of money 
we would spend on health care other-
wise .... The 28 cents of the dollar we 
are spending on adminis1ration now,

But being unimured doesn't mean 
you don't get health care. It means 
you walk into the emergency room 
when you are sick, have thousands of 
dollars spent at the taxpayers' ex-
peme, instead of getting primary care 
for $100. So, we would be spending 
our money much more wisely, and we 
have enough left over to improve our

one who we love and care about who 
may be at risk. The difference is, if a 
catastrophe were to happen to your 
parents, let's say, today; and let's say, 
you had an inheritance of $500,000, 
just for the sake of argument; a long-
term care biD would be S50,000 per 
year. They will pay that out of [your] 
inheritance, until they're in poverty. 
then Medical will help them. What this

them - to pay 2.5 percent of taxable 
income. 2.5 pen::ent to protect your 
inheritance - if you want to 100k al it

ment doesn't employ the doctors or 
own the hospitals. I n fact, you can 

think of this aIlIIOIII • a voucher sys--
tem of sorts because._ you take your

the doctor or hospital of your choice.

tition for quality. If yO!! have a doctor 
whom you rike, or whom the data 
shows is I really good doctor, that 
person is going to have plenty ofbusi-

You have a Health Maintenance

lousy. that is rippingoff30 cents out of 
every premium dollar to pay for a $3 . .5 
million CEO bonus. .. are you going to 
take your card there? I don't think so. 
You're going to go where your money 
is going to help you. So those ineffi-
cient or unscrupulous providers of 
health care will go out of business. 

So this is competition for quality.

Let's talk about that University of 
California Health Economist Duane 
Banks. ... He's never done Slate or 
national hc:aIth-<:are financing calcu-
lations, let alone submitted them and 
published them in a pcerreview. which 
is the standard foncademic work His 
analysis ... [makes] addition enors to-
taling about $20 billion dollars. And 
it 's not as if health economists could 
debate this point. 

He writes down $11.9 billion for 
what Medicare spends in California 
in a given year. WeD, that year, Medi-
care says they spend $15.65 biUion. 
Here's the numbers, here's their own 
data, he makes a $4 billion adding 
mistake. Hedoes thataaoss the board,' 
program after program. That's not 
underfunding, that 's called stupidity .... 

Point by point, Dorothy Rice, who 
is the past statistician for the U.S. 
Department of Statistics, has looked 
at thosenumbelli and has said that our 
numbersarelotally funded and Bank '5 

analysis is bogus. ... 
Our analysis his us with a S4 bil-

lion surplus in the first year, and grow_ 
ing thereafter. [Kevin] Grumblch and 
Grobenhiemer, who didouranaJysis, 
have published health<are calcula-
tions on state and national expendi-
tures in every leading academic jour-
nal. They are the nationaJ experts on 
these kinds of calculations. Whereas, 
Banks doesn't know his you-know-
what from his you-know-where on 
this.. ... 

But it's not just .these numbers. 
The Canadians are spending 40 per_ 
cent less money per person than us, 
why is it that we're not doing 40 
percent better than them?'How come 
they cover all of their people and we 
don't? How corne they have the high-
est satisfaction in the Western world? 
How corne their outcomes, not just 
from infant mortality and things like 
that, are better than ours?

That's an interesting point. There's 
this myth that says, "Oh my God, if you 
make health care available, you're go-

The UCSD GaardiaD 

ing to just UIC it like it', CIDdy." Well, 
stop and think about that argument. 

First of all, we have talked about 
the factthatemapncy care is already 
available under federal law, so every-
body is getting emerpncy care. What 
we are providing now is the opportu-
nity for them to get primary care. 
Primary care saves money; you don't 
wait until you need a multi-thousand 
dollar emergency visit. Primary care 
services are actually very cost-effcc-
live. If ... 20 peroent of the population 
were dying in the streets, they can go 
to the emergency rooms. And who 
would pay for that? The taxpayers. 
We're already paying for etneIBency 
care. All this proposition allows... is 
primary care when they need it 

Under the initiative we have a 
mechanism called global budgeting 
which allows the medical society to 
establish what are called practice pa_ 
rameters, these are the norms of a 
practice on average. For example, if 
you saw 1 OOpeopJe, 1 Oofthem would 
need this, five of them would need 
that and whatever. If you have some 
doctor who cheats - for every 10 
people they saw, they did 20 ofthese 
services-that person stands out like 

a ICft thumb in a ainsJe peir. 
Becauae you have one computer 

which aU of the biHiDg is flowing 
through, so you 're able to say, "We're 
going to leave 95 pen:ent of the d0c-
tors a10ne becaUIC they're within the 
global budget. .. The five who are out-
side of that limit, we will look at them 
a little more closely." That's in COIl- -
trasI to what we do now .... We have 
hundreds of different insurance 00I'I1-
panies, and every doctor gets scruti-
nized for every patient, every note, 
every hospital, every day. That's 
what's wasteful .... 

People say, "Ob my God, you're 
selling in place this big, new bureau-
cracy." No, it's a tiny bureaucracy. 
Look at an example: Blue Cross in 
Massachusetts, cr, has 6,300 em-
ployees for its health plan which cov-
ers 3.1 million [people] in Massachu-
setts. The health-are administration 
for the province of British Columbia, 

~ which also has 3.1 million 
residents, has 400 employees in its 
single-payer health insurance system. 
Its more than a 1 O-fold decrease in the 
numberofemployces. .. There'sahuge 
amount of waste we have built into the 
system ....

The truth of the matter is that this

bum out. What • can guarantee ... is 
that we're going to face (increasing

whether we pass this initiative or not. 
The difference is, if we pass this, the 
$20 billion we are wasting every year 
will be spent better .... 

Alii can say is that we have taken 
every precaution that we, as bumam, 
can come up with to make sure it 
would be accountable to the peopJe,to 
make sure that critical judgment pre-
vailed and beyond that, to make sure

SURFERS FACE A VARIElY OF 
DISEASES WHILE IN TIlE 

OCEAN OFF OF SAN DIEGO 
Continued from .,.,. 1 
Estep's skin and eyes were yellow, 
his doctor told him that jaundice had 
already set in. Tests revealed that 
Estep had contracted the Hepatitis 
A virus ~A V). 

" I thought I was going to die," he 
said. " I was yellow, and aliI wanted 
to do was sleep. I couldn ' t sleep on 
my side because my liver was so 
swollen. I lost my memory at times, 
because the bile would back up into 
my brain. Nobody wants to get this 
disease." 

Estep's symptoms lasted for 
more than two months, and he is 

fever - set in quickly. As the dis-
ease progresses, jaundice, a severe 
infection of the liver, turns an in-
fected person 's skin and eyes yel-
low, as bile begins to flow through 
the bloodstream. Changes in the 
color of urine and stool often occur. 

Unlike its more serious cousins, 
Hepatitis Band C, there is no vac-
cine for Hepatitis A. However, of-
ten agammo-globulinshot can boost 
the immune system enough to effec-
tively prevent the onset of the dis-

At UCSD, surfboards are almost 
as common as backpacks full of 
books. It is a campus fuJI of beach-
lovers. But the beautiful, blue wa-
ters, which are just minutes from 
campus, are not always as pristine 
as they look. 

San Diego has some of the most 
polluted ocean water in the country, 
and the risks faced by ocean-goers 
are rea\. Despite the on-going ef-
forts of County Public Health offi-
cials and others, pollutants from un-
treated human waste often linger 
just off shore. For the moment, the 
best the government can do is post 
warnings and close beaches, and 
hORC that people will get the mes-
sage. 

Polluted water can infect a per-
son with anything from 
"Montezuma's Revenge" to Hepa-
titis to a head cold. 

But given its frequency and grav-
ity, Hepatitis is the one of the most 
serious threats to surfers. 
'Nobody W..u to let ""'.' 

According to Dr. Michelle 
Ginsberg of the Department of 
Health Services, 513 cases of HA V 
were reported in San Diego County 
last year. Although Ginsberg said 
that most of the infections did not 
result from polluted ocean water, 
she cautioned that the risk is real. 

"Surfers need to be careful and 
check for warning signs about high 
bacteria counts," she said. 

HAVis a virus, and part of a 
large group of infectious agents 
which includes everything from the 
common flu and chicken pox to HIV, 
the virus which causes AIDS. 

luted water," said UCSD Student 
Health Medical Director Brian 
Murray. 

Mumy encourages anyone who 
has surfed in an area with posted, 
high-bacteria warnings, or who is 
planning to surf anywhere in Mexico; 
or any other Third World country, to 
get a gammo-globulin shot. 
......... Nat All 

While among the most serious, 
Hepatitis is by no means the only 
health risk which surfers face from 
polluted water. According to Dr. 
Gordon La Bedz, a physician at 
Kaiser Permanente, the most com-
mon ailment caused by contami-
nated water is otitis externa, or 
swimmer's ear. This inner-ear in-
fection is extremely painful and can 
sometimes permanently damage 
hearing. 

Gastro enterritus, or 
"Montezuma's Revenge," the infa-
mous bane of American tourists in 
Mexico, is also carried in polluted

rare, have also been ()()ntracted from 
contaminated ocean water. 
,..,... ..... 

The situation, however, may not 
be as daunting as it sounds. "In 
general, surfing is a very healthful 
sport," said La Bedz. ".But if you are 
surfing in an area that has been in-
fluenced by human wute, you are at 
great risk." 

La Bedz recommends a number 

Since few people Cln always fol-
low such a healthy regimen, La Bedz 
offered several other suggestions. 

Swimming or surfing near storm 
drain outflowa, river mouths, and 
near the Mexican border all put a 
penon at risk, he said. In addition, 
while the surf is often best shortly 
after a rainstorm, there is no worse 
time to be in the water. 

"It is very unhealthful to swim 
within 72 hours of rain," La Bedz 
said. "Everytbing that has been col-
lected in storm drains is swept out to 
sea, untreated. That includes raw 
sewage from overflowing septic 
tanks. It is quite foolish to surf after 
rain." 
"'ttIIiC ... tile ,-

While surfing in California is 
relatively safe, San Diego County 
has the most polluted beaches in the 
state, according to Pierce Flynn of 
the Surfrider Foundation, a non-
profit, environmental lobbying 
group which represents surfen 
around the country. 

Water in San Diego county is 
tested 20 times per week by County 
Public Health, Uling some of the 
most accurate techniques available. 

Because it is difficult, if not im-
possible, to directly detect many of 
the disease-causing bacteria in wa-
ter, scientists use what are called "in-
dicator organisms". Indicator organ-
isms are, in this case, bacteria which 
are usually present only when other 
harmful diseases or bacteria are evi-
dent. Indicators are generally absent 
from clean water and they must be 
easy to isolate, identify and measure. 

The most common test used is 
for "total coliform bacteria" - a 
group of several different bacteria 
mostly of intestinal origin. 

This testing hu several draw-
backs, however. Total coliforms can 
regrow in water and become part of 
the natural fauna rather tban simply a 
resultofwater poIlution,cauaing what 
seientisla call a "false positive." 

In addition, a number of danger-
ous bacteria survive longer than lO-
tal coliforms in water, leading to a 
negative test result even though bac-
teria may be present. 

Unlike HIV, however, Hepatitis 
is contagious - the disease is trans-
mittable through contaminated food 
and water. Because the virus can 
survive for several days in ocean 
water, surfers and swimmers are in 
danger if they come into contact 
with water which has been contami-
nated by untreated sewage. 

Surfers can f8C •• ywlety of w.teHIom ....... 

In 1993, San Diegana witnessed 
n7beach-closure ua result of high-
bacteria counts - more than any 
other county in the nation. Another, more difficult method 

tests for "fecal coliforms," a sub-
group of total coliforma, and is a 
more accurate indicator of 
thepresence of fecal pathogens.

Cholera, typhoid fever and res-
piratory infections, though quite

againstocean-bomdiseues, he said, 
is good health. 

"Get eight hours of sleep. keep a 
diet of mainly fruila and vegetables 
get daily exercise and manage your 
stress level. If you do all of this, no 
germ in the world can touch you," 
La Bedz said. 

That ranking may be somewhat 
misleading, however. Aocording to 
the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, an environmental group 
baaed in Washington, DC, San 
Diego 'I water-testill8 system is one 
of the best and therefore most strin-
gent in the country, and compari-
sons to other counties can be some-
what deceptive.

WIPED OUT: 
Treatment plant may 
help solve problems 
ContInued from .... 10 
cific harmful bacteria if necessary. " 
.......... , ...... 

The majority of harmful bacteria 
and viruses in water come from hu-
man waste. "Wut~ater is ()()ntami-
nated by sick individuals," said Os-
car Gonzoles, a wastewater expert 
and a member of the Scientific Re-
view Board of the Surfrider Founda-
tion. "Even though the water is 
treated, most treatment plants re-
move only the solids and hardly any 
of the viruses or bacteria. However, 
because the wastewater [in the 
United States) is taken far offshore, 
the organisms die before they get to 
shore." 

Mexico does not take the same 
precautions with its waste, creating 
much of the contamination of San 
Diego beaches. In Mexico, untreated 
sewage generally flows directly 
down the rivers and drains into the 
ocean. Even if the sewage is treated, 
it is often not delivered far enough 
off shore for the bacteria to die. 

A major source of San Diego's 
pollution is the Tijuana River. An 
ocean current which runs south to 
north most of the year brings pol-
luted water from the river to San 
Diego's beaches. 

The beaches closest to the border 
suffer the most. Imperial beach was 
closed 186 days last year~ and two 
areas, from Seacoast Dr. south to the 
Tijuana River and from the mouth 
of the San Luis Rey River to 

Oceanside. have been closed for 
nearly 10 yean II a result of high 
bacteria counla. 
IoIvIItC tile PMIII •• 

California bas contended with 
pollution off its coastline for de-
cades. As cities have grown and 
much of the state has been ()()vered 
with asphalt and cement, more pol-
luted-rain runoff feeds into the 
ocean, rather than percolating 
through the soil. In addition, 
Mexico's population has grown be-
yond its ability to control and treat 
sewage. Both of these factors have 
made California beaches some of 
the most polluted in the nation. 

In an effort to reverse this t~nd, 
Congress passed the Clean Water 
Act, which requires states to test for 
contaminates and warn the public of 
any potential risks. 

Recently, the United States 
stepped up efforts to control Mexi-
can-generated pollution that reaches 
California. The U.S. government has 
begun constructing a $338 million 
sewage-treatment plant in the 
Tijuana River Valley. Construction 
of the 25-million-gallon-per-day 
plant began in July and is planned to 
be in operation by late next year. 

However, the project has ()()me 
under heavy criticism. ~ technical 
study conducted by Engineering 
Science, Inc. of La Jolla, reported 
that there is a "fair likelihood" that 
the harmful bacteria found in Mexi-
can sewage will continue to con-
taminateCalifornia beaches because 
the plant would only filter out sol-
ids. 

"The problem with that is that the 
ocean current will circulate [bacte-

ria) and brill8 it right back to shore," 
said Flynn of Surfrider. 

The Surfrider Foundation and the 
Sierra Club have filed a lawsuit in an 
effort to halt ttie construction of the 
plant by December. at the end of the 
first phase of construction. The two 
environmental organizations have 
suggested a cheaper, and in their 
opinion more effective, technique 
for treating tbe sewage. 

A Surfrider Foundation press re-
lease stated that the organization 
"applauds the elected representatives 
who have worked so hard for the 
beginning of this project. We are 
demanding though~ that steps be 
taken to review and consider the 
'ponding' alternative." 

Costing an estimated $45 million 
to construct, tbe "ponding" alterna-
tive would be far less expensive, and 
would cleanse wastewater to the poi nt 
that it ()()uld be used for agriculture. 
It would produce no ocean outfall. 

The International Boundary and 
Water Commission, which is build-
ing the plant, could not be reached 
for ()()mmen!. However, regardless 
of which plant is built, people who 
spend time in the ocean will always 
be in danger. 

"My fearis that we don ' t take this 
disease seriously enough," Estepsaid. 
"People trip over the [waming) signs 
to get out and surf. The risk may not 
be big for tourists who only go in the 
water every once in a while, but if 
you're a serious water person, then 
you need to be really careful." 

But, he admitted, that is often 
hard advice to follow. "When the 
waves are good, you just want to get 
out there and surf."

SHOOT OUT 
ContInued from PIC. 24 

But Armstrong was a fresh spring 
breeze compared to the first of my 
~o competitors, a little girl named 
Katie. This was an absolute night-
mare. No matter how good my shots 
were, eventually Armstrong would 
stop one and I was going to lose to 
her. After all, what kind of heartless 
keeper would deny a little girl? 

Apparently, the Derek Armstrong 
kind. After I had made all three of 
my shots, it was her tum. Katie's filS 
altempt was straight and true, and the 
chivalrous Armstrong dove to avoid 
theball. Katie 's second shot was also 
well hit, directly at the keeper who 
reflexively caught it. Big mistake. 

The boos that cascaded down 

were deafening. Armstrong looked 
chastened while Katie, who prob-
ably thought the crowd was booing 
her, looked like she was about to cry. 
No matter how mlJ1Y national titles 
he wins in the future, I believe Derek 
Armstrong will always be remem-
bered as The Man Who Stopped The 
Uttle Girl 's Shot. 

The third competitor, Derek 
Bennett, and I ended up tied after the 
first round and headed into sudden 
death. 

As I lined up for the shot, 
Armstrong smiled !=Onfidently. He 
knew I was just a Yankee football 
heathen, there was no way I was 

_ going to get this by him. Well, he 
was right He stopped it off-handedly 
as if to say, "Why not just stick to 
writing, reporter boy?" I sighed, all 

The UCSD Guardiu 

was lost. But Bennett kept me alive 
when he apparently forgot that s0c-
cer is not football in this country and 
he kicked it well over the crossbar, 
as if booting a 55-yard field goal. 

It all came down to this shot. I 
carefully lined up, examined all the 
angles, closed my eyes, held my 
breath and slipped the ball into the 
right corner. Unfortunately for 
Bennett, the plucky senior still had 
not gotten football and soccer 
straight and launched his shot over 
the crossbar and into Arizona again. 

After the whole experience was 
over, Armstrong walked up to me, 
smiled warmly, stuck out his hand 
and said "If you ever tell anyone you 
beal me, I'll have you killed."

"Early losses have come back to

"IlIey think they're doing better than

Every goal matters. A 1-0 game was

we did today. I bow the [NCAA) 
selection committee, and I don't 
want to give them a chance of keep-
ing us out [of the postseason)." 

"It has been a tension-packed, 
season and we knew it was going to 
be after we lost some games early. 
We have no room to maneuver. I just 
want to get into the playoffs and 
wipe the slate clean. Then we will 
be back to where we want to be," 
Armstrong concluded.

Despite its less-than-inspiring 
name, the Mount Baldy tournament 
turned out to be a an important step 
for the UCSD water polo team on 
its road to' the NCAA playoffs. 

The Tritons finished third in the 
12-team weekend tournament, win-
ning three games and dropping one. 

Saturday'S first game against

Marymount team. But the Tritons 
were still on a roll and poIdIed the 
Lions, 9-1. With the victory, UCSD 
won its bracket and headed into 
Sunday's first contest against rival 
Air Force. 

The tenth-ranted Falcons were a 
tougher adversary for the 12th-
ranked Tritons. Tied 4-4, Air Force 
grabbed the momentum with a 
seven-meter, two-point shot that 
"should never have scored, "lCICOrd-
ing to UCSD Head Coach Denny 
Harper. 

UCSD had a chance to tie the 
game or draw within one when the 
Falcons had a player ejected, but the 
Tritons collapsed mentally and 

ended up with a player ejected them-
selves. Instead of a man-up situation, 
the teams were even, IDd Air Force 
scored again to take oontrol of the 
game and went on to win, ll-S. 

UCSD's final pme wu a 13-12 
triumph over 11th-ranked University 
ofMIIIICbUII8eUJ-Amberst. UMasa 
pulled ahead, but the Tritons came 
bect and outscored their foes, Sol, 
in the final quarter. 

UCSD's Mite Yellic:h won the 
game with only seven seconds show-
ing on the cloek. In addition to 
Yellich's heroic:a, James Staalen 
soored sill goals while goaIteeper 
Sean Osborne, -bad a great game, " 
Harper said.

Tritons Showcase Depth at Invite 
BRONCO: UCSD men's and women's squads capture third place overall 
ByTeddUdd 
AssocIIIte Sports Editor 

Do you want to know the mean-
ins of the word "depth"? "Depth" 
isn't having a couple of extra line-

backers on 
the bench or 
being able to 
send in fresh 
men late ina 
basketball 
game. 

No, to 
experience 
'depth ,' 
you'd have 
to have been 
in UCSD 
cross coun· 

try Head Coach Ted Van Arsdale's 
sneakers last weekend. 

Van ArsdaIe sent his youthful Tri-
tons northward to Bonelli Park in 
San Dimas early SaturdaYI perhaps 
anticipating his 'B'-tearners to be 
fodder for such fierce foes as the Air

remarkable depth. The Triton ' B' 
teams grabbed third place overall in 
both the men 's and women 's Divi-
sion n races at the highly competi· 
tive Bronco Invitational. 

"We've worked hard to develop 
strong ' A' and ' B' teams," Van 
Arsdale said. "Now the line divid-
ing the two [teams] is not so well 
defined." 

The UCSD men's squad garnered 
97 total points, skewering its near-
est opponent Concordia University 
by a dominating 71-point margin. 
Southern California College took 
first at the meet with a low 55-point 
tally. 

Rhodes Walton, Van Arsdale's 
male selecti9n for the Triton-of-the-
week, grabbed the reins for UCSD, 
finishing first on the team with an 
llth-place finish in 26: 13. 

ing to 17th and 19th maries in 26:45 
and 27:05, respectively. 

UCSD's Steve Varnell took a 
solid minute off his most recent ef-
forts, galloping to a 24th-place fin-
ish in 27:36. 

"The men 's squad is really com-
ing together," Van Arsdale said. 
"They backed each other up ex-
tremely well at the meet. " 

Mark .. Latka" Vargas (27:37) and 
Richard Erkkila (28:04) vaulted up 
to the fifth and sixth UCSD sooring 
spots with 26th- and 30th-place 
overall performances. 

"Four years ago, this team could 
have beaten our 'A' team," Van 
Arsdale said. "I'm really proud of 
them." 

In a formidable field of]OO run-
ners, K.C. Klinger (28:11) and Pe· 
ter Devine (28:]3) proved to be up 
to the test, closing out UCSD's scor-
ing. 

" For many of our athletes it was 
their last opportunity to compete," 

"[Walton] ran 20 seconds faster 
than lut year on thi.s same track," 
Van Arsdale said. "He had a surgery 
lay-off earlier in the year, and now 
he's coming on strong." Van Arsdale said. "It 's the best seven '. 

Tritons Mike Wallace and Alan 
Grant weren't too rar behind, sprint-

[runners] from now on."

Tritons Scavenge Win Over Coyotes 
STREAKING: UCSD (20-5) won its seventh consecutive 
match defeating Division II UC San Bernardino in five sets 
By D .... Kreft 
Sports Co-Editor 

Coming into Friday night's showdown with 
Division II Cal State San Bernardino, the UCSD 
women's volleyball team had tasted victory in six-

consecutive matches. The 
last time the Tritons had 
been dealt a defeat was 
against this same CSUSS 
squad on Oct. 8. With a 
chance to earn their 20th vic-
tory of the season and 
avenge their most recent 
loss, the Tritons had all the 
motivation they needed to 
beat San Bernardino. 

UCSD dominated game 
one early on. Middle blocker 
Christine Chi rose up and 

rejected a Coyote spiker and then recorded a ser-
vice ace to take the Tritons to a 3- t advantage. 
Some creative moves by UCSD extended its lead. 

First, outside hitler Angelle Crochet tapped a 
roll shot over and in, and then setter Jennifer 

'Schofield smacked an errant pass by the Coyotes 
into the open court for another point. A number 
of passing errors by CSUSB quickly led to a 9-3 
lead for the Tritons. 

UCSD stumbled, however, relinquishing the 
next five points to allow the Coyotes back into 
the game at 9-8. The Tritons rebounded on a 
couple of errors by CSUSS and a kill by senior 
Julie Harvey to grab a three-point cushion at 12-
9, but then suffered yet another let down. The 
Coyotes took full advantage of UCSD's late-game 
woes, running the table to win the game, 15-12. 

"We didn't play tough enough at the end of 
game one," UCSD Head Coach Doug Dannevik 
said. "We didn't focus and we caved in a bit." 

The second game was crucial for the Tri-
tons who could ill-afford to go down by two 
games to a strong Division II foe like CSUSB. 
The Tritons and Coyotes were neck-and-neck 
early, until UCSD strung together five points 
which boosted it to an t t -5 lead. 

From tbat point on the Tritons played San 
Bernardino even, which was enough to earn 
a game point at 14-10. UCSD's blocking 
corps made sure that this opportunity would 
not pass them by, rising up to stuff a Coyote 
hitter and tally the final point of the game. 

Early in the third game, the two squads 
were once again deadlocked in a tough battle, 
with neither side able to grab a substantial 
lead. That is, until Crochet stepped up to serve 
for the Tritons. 

Crochet served her first ball with UCSD 
trailing by one, and Harvey slammed the ball 
down on the left side to knot the match at six. 
Crochet was still serving when, seven points 
later, sophomore Madelyn Ripken cranked 
one of her 16 kills between two Coyote 
blockers to boost the Tritons lead to seven 
points at 13-6. 

When CSUSB had finally dislodged Cro-
chet from the server's box, it took advantage 
of UCSD's token hospitality and climbed 
back to within striking distance, 13-I 1. 

The Tritons ' blocking once again saved 
the day, however, as Jenn Cross and Crochet 
crammed a bad pass back down the Coyotes' 
throats to bring UCSD within a point of the 
game. Cross struck again at game point, this 
time in tandem with Schofield as the two 
walled off the right side of the net and re-
jected a huge spike attempt by San 
Bernardino's leader in kills, Nicole Wasson.

V-BALL: Tritons 
down CSUSB in five 
ContInued ......... 1.1 

"We came back and played sol-
idly in games two and three (after 
the tough loss in game one)." Dan-
neviksaid. . 

The 15-11 vic:lory gave UCSD a 
2-1 lead going into the fourth game. 

Just as in the previoul three 
games, the Coyotes and Tritons were 
locked in a tight battle. Midway 
through, the squads were tied at nine. 

UCSD grabbed a narrow two-
point lead at 11-9. when Cross 
crushed home a perfect slide set 
from Schofield on the right side. But 
CSUSB quickly taUied two points of 
its own to knot the contest once 
again, this time at 11 . 

The VCSD GuardiaD 

The Tritons scored two of the 
following three points to grab a 13-
12 lead and were within a point of 
the game when Chi served up an ace. 
San Bernardino quickly called for a 
timeout to slow UCSD's momen-
tum, and the move paid off. The 
Coyotes snared the next two points 
and forced the Tritons to call 
timeout. 

TIm Cllen/Gulnfian

UCSD's timeout did not have the 
desired effect, though. and CSUSB 
sent the contest into a fifth set with 
a 16-14 triumph. 

Game five was a nerve-racking 
affair with rally scoring imple-
mented to quicken the pace of the 
contest. The Tritons. however, came 
out fired up. 

"When we got into that fifth 
game, we tried to be excited about 
the opportunity," Dannevik said, 
"It's impon&nt to be ready to play 
those fifth games in NCAAs." 

Good defense gave the Tritons an 

early lead. Crochet stuffed a dink 
attempt by the Coyotes for a point, 
and then Chi made a spectacular dig 
which led to another UCSD point 
and a 7-4 lead for the Tritons. 

Cross fired a ball past the San 
Bernardino defense off a quick set 
from Schofield and then put a tough 
serve into the deep-left comer, that 
the Coyotes mishandled. That error 
gave UCSD a 9-5 cushion. San Ber-
nardino burned a timeout to regroup 
and tallied the next two points be-
fore the Tritons slammed the door 
on its hopes. 

Once again it was Crochet serv-

ing strong and the Tritons 'D' that 
came up big. Ripken made a big dig, 
and Chi slammed it home to end a 
five-point run and bring UCSD to 
the verge of victory. After dropping 
two points, the Tritons put the match 
away, 15-9. 

The UCSD stat sheet showed 
some incredible numbers for the Tri-
tons, including 32 digs for Crochet 
and an astounding .737 hining per-
centage for Chi en rouu to her game-
high 17 kills. 

"(It felt] fabulous," Schofield 
said. "We're confident we can com-
pete at the national level."

nine out of 10 timCi he gets all baD." 

On the offensive side, the Tritorll 
owned Cal Lu, controlling the ball 
the entire half and permiting only 
one shot on UCSO keeper George 
Allison. 

And yet, as Armstrong was quick 
to point out, the score was knotted 
0-0 as the first half whistle sounded. 

"Cal Lu was not a good team and 
I realized the potential for disaster 
today," Arl1lstrong said. "We let 
them into the game by not scoring. 
This was a must win game and we 
had a little bit of a wobble. They 
started to pick up confidence and we 
were falling. If we make one mis-
take then we are a goal down, and 
we 're in trouble. I know my team 
does not work well in those situa-
tions. I don ' t like wasting 45 min-
utes, and it took far too long to put 
them away."

we were going to walk in and roll 
these people over. Chapman and 
Oaremonl both beat these teams by 
a good margin so we had to stay con-
sistent with those lanes, if we had 
a ahot at the playoffs. " 

The Tritons second goal came at 
the 57:19 mule. After some sloppy 
defense by Cal Lu, senior Todd 
Cunan found Waldman on the right 
endline. Waldman faked to the 
middle, turned to the baseline and 
fired a bullet-crossing pass that 
skimmed by Kingsmen keeper Ryan 
Kaufman and hit a breakaway 
Turner in perfect stride. Turner 
throttled a right-footed shot to the 
far left comer of the cage to give 
UCSO a 2-0 advantage.

Turner again made his presence 
known in UCSO's final score of the 
day at 69:28. Handling the ball be-
tween midfield and the 18-yard line, 
Turner launched a picture-perfect 
pass to Curran and found himself 
with only one Cal Lu defender to 
beat. Although the usually rock-

Tritons pound Regals 
Contln ..... from ..... 24 
The Tritons completely dominated 
play from the opening whistle, leav-
ing the Regals without any scoring 
chances . While Cal Lutheran 
notched only two shots on goal, they 
did manage to keep Schwartz busy 
during the first half. But Schwartz 
was a lonely keeper during the sec-
ond half because of a Triton defense 
which shut out the Regals, giving 
them no shots after intermission. 

She timed it perfectly and trapped 
the ball, only to find Carver coming 
out of Ote goal to challenge her. 
Lauren Johnson slid the ball to the 
left side and into the net for the 
game's first score. 

"[lee] crossed it and I saw it go-
ing over the defense and just antici-
pated it. We're always supposed to 
start wide and then cut to the 
middle," she said. 

The Tritons second score came 
14 minutes later. This time it was 
UCSD's Brenna Cox who fed 
Lauren Johnson, but the fClult was 
the same. She dribbled to the top 
right comer of the penalty box and 
nailed a bud grounder to the fu post 
that just beat a diving Carver. 

, __ the Tritons up 1-0. 

Hetherington befuddled the Cal Lu 
defense, and Hethering-ton's aim 
from 12-yards out to the far post 
proved far truer than anything the 
out-of-their-league Kingsmen could 

The UCSD offense was busy as 
well. The Tritons were making the 
most of their sideline opportunities 
with deep runs and crosses galore. 
And when Cal Lu tried to take away 
the sides, UCSD was took the ball 
straight up the middle. 

The Triton scoring turned out to 
be a family affair. With four-and-a-
half minutes to play, Lauren's sister 
Amanda Johnson took a throw-in 
from Usa Wilkinson along the left 
sideline, about 30 yards from the 
goal. Amanda Johnson looked 
around for a second and then seem-
ingly lofted a shot as an afterthought. 
The ball was a rainbow that would 
have made Kermit the Frog proud, 
but somehow managed to arc over a 
befuddled Carver before dropping 
straight down behind the keeper and 
into the net.

"It's a chronic case with this soc-
cer team. As soon as we get the first 
one, the Oood gates open," Fujii said. 
" I guess that first goal really boosts 
our confidence, and then we really 
start playing to our capability." 

"! think Armstrong gets a little 
nervous and frustrated," Assistant 
Coach Ted przybylek said. "This 
was a game we needed to win big. 
Going into OT or a tie would have 

muster. 
"It was a pretty goal," Fujii said. 

"All the passes connected like con-
nect the dots." 

Fujii nearly added his name to the 
goals-scored list with 10m inutes to 
play. The breakaway forward made 
solid contact with a Turner cross 
from the right side, but Kaufman's 

See M. SOCCER, Page 14 

Although the opportunities were 
there, the Tritons didn't convert un-
til 28 minutes were left on the clock. 
UCSO's Dawn Lee came up from 
her sweeper position to take the ball 
on the left sideline, 10 yards inside 
Cal Lu territory. She lofted a text-
book centering pass toward the 
middle of the penalty box. Team-
mate Lauren Johnson, meanwhile, 
saw the pass and ran for . the spot.

"This was a great victory for us," 
Lee said. "We knew it would be big 
and it turned out to be one of the 
better skills games we've hael" 

"We scored three great goals and 
that means we're finishing our op-
portunities better," UCSO Head 
Coach Brian McManus said. "In the 
first half, they were sending every-
body up to hit us, but in the second 
half we just relaxed." 

While it was a big win for the 
Tritons. it probably was not the best 
thing that could have happened to 
them at this point in the season. Be-
cause of a lack of financing, it is 
likely that only one California team 
will make it into the WCltern Re-
gional finals. And despite the ract 
that the Tritons are the second-
ranked team in the country and Cal 
Lu is number six, the two teams will 
probably meet in a preliminary 
round on Nov. 2 to determine who 
gets to go to those regional finals. 

For that reason, this win could not 
have come at a worse timt for 
UCSO. "They saw everything we 
had today," McManus said. "And 
now they have two weeks to plan to 
beat us, because they've seen our 
best. It's absolutely ridiculous to 
have these two teams playing in a 
preliminary round. It's criminal." 

Lars really had the 
blahs, and not even 
acupuncb.lre (p. 20) 
provided any relief. 
After a dozen cups of 
Joe at Java City 
(p.17) he called 
Council Travel (p. 7), 
booked a flight to 
HawaII and put it on 
his VIsa (p. 8). As 
he took off out of

a better idea.

GREGG WRENN P RT~ 
The Halftime 
Shootout UCSD Soccer· Makes Cal Luse 

You'll excuse me if this is my 
last column, because pretty soon 
I'll be too busy winning games for 
the tJCSD men's soccer team. You 
see, I won the Halftime Shoot-Out 
at yesterday's women 's soccer 
game, and if that isn't reason 
enough to be playing for our boys 
in blue, I don 't know what is. 

SPANKING: Tritons start off slow but blow by 
Regals in second half to take 3-0 victory over 
arch-rival and extend unbeaten streak to 35 

This halftime shoot-out is 
roughly along the lines of the 
infamous basketball Halftime 
Shoot-Out, which was so popular 
the last few years but was 
unfortunately canceled when 
~veral hundred rowdy fans, eager 
to get a good space in line, 
trampled the teams, which were 
still involved with playing the last 
five minutes of the first half. 

With the soccer contest, no 
mobs of shoot-out crazy fans 
charge the goals while the teams 
flee for their lives. No, this shoot-
out is very orderly. If you are in a 
shoot-out kind of mood when you 
arrive at the field, you can fill out 
an entry blank that states your 
desire to participate in the contest. 
Then you drop the form in a box 
and hope that when the first half 
ends, the announcer calls your 
name to "report to the south goal 
immediately!" (Helpful tip: You 
stand a much better chance of 
having your name drawn if you 
fill out 50 entry forms and then 
remove everyone else's entries 
from the box.) 

Naturally, I was euphoric after 
hearing my name called, and I 
clearly remember the thoughts 
that went racing through my mind 
as I confidently strode onto the 
pitch: "Dear Lord, please don't let 
me miss the ball completely, slip 
and fall on my butt, because now 
the entire crowd knows my name 
and'I'm sure they're taping this to 
show on ESPN tonight, and it's 
funny how the crowd has 
suddenly grown from 300 to over 
three-quarters of a million 
now .. . ". 

Well, that kind of embarrass-
ment was nothing compared to the 
nightmare I faced as I arrived at 
the top of the penalty box. The 
goalie turned out to be none other 
than UCSD men 's soccer Head 
Coach Derek Armstrong, the man 
who has led the Tritons to three 
national titles. Not only did he 
know what to do as the goalie, but 
I could feel him inside my head, 
reading my mind and knowing 
what I was going to do with each 
kick even before I did. Even his 
accent was intimidating. 

By area Wrenn 
Co-Sports Editor 

If this really was a playoff pre-
view, the postseason future looks 
bright for the UCSD women's 

soc c e r 
team. The 
Tritons, 
Western 
region's 
top-ranked 
team, got 
off to a ten-
tative start 
against 
nemesis and 
second-
ranked Cal 

Lutheran yesterday, but came 
alive after halftime to dominate 
the Regals and walk away with a 
3-0 victory. 

With the win, UCSD improved 
its record to 10-0-3 on the season 
and extended its school-record, 
regular-season unbeaten streak to 
35 games. UCSD's last regular 
season loss came at the hands of 
Cal Lutheran on Oct. 9,1992. 

The 1994 version of the game 
was just as close as the '92 con-
test - for the first 45 minutes of 
the game as the Tritons came out 
of the blocks a bit uptight. 

The Regals spent the first 20 
minutes of the game in control, 
keeping a steady pressure on the 

UCSD defense. On the other half of 
the field, Cal Lutheran has always 
been a physical opponent and 
Sunday's game was no different. The 
Regal defenders spent the first 20 
minutes knocking Triton attackers 
off the ball and keeping UCSD from 
controlling anything in the Cal Lu 
half of the field. 

But UCSD settled down from its 
nervous start and got its first real 
opportunity on a 3O-yard shot from 
Brandie Hayungs that forced Regal 
keeper Kimberly Carver into a div-
ing stop. The ensuing corner kick 
didn't work for UCSD, but from that 
point on, the Tritons evened out con-
trol of the ball. 

UCSD also discovered its speed 
advantage along the sidelines. Tri-
ton Carin Pugh spent much of the 
game outrunning the slower Regal 
defenders and teamed up with 
sophomore Ele Johnson on a nice 
chance with 11 :55 to play in the half. 
Pugh raced up the left sideline, burn-
ing Cal Lu's Shelly Burgess before 
making a move to the inside. The 
Triton tried an outside-foot cross to 
Johnson who was swinging in from 
the right side. Carver wu there to 
cover the cross, but bobbled the ball 
before recovering with Johnson 
standing over her. 

The second half was an entirely 
different ball game from the first.

CORONA nON: Tritons abdicate Kingsmen, 3-0, 
in must-win confrontation with Division III rival 
By BrIM K. Hutto 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Triton men's soccer team 
(10-6-1) knew the road to the play-
offs ran through the Cal Lutheran 

University 
Kingsmen. 
Inevitably it 
always does. 
So one would 
think that 
UCSD's 3-0 
skunking of 
the visiting ri-
vah! yesterday 
would have 
them bnUing 
open cham-

pagne bottles and kissing babies in 
the streets. 

Guess not. "[Head Coach] Derek 
Armstrong loves to yell," junior K. 
Christopher Fujii said. "Even when 
we're playing all right, he is still yell-

ing. Sometimes it gets frustrating. 
But I think we, as a team, responded 
well to the pressure of the game." 

Armstrong had ample reason to 
be miffed in the first half of the 
physical match up. UCSD simply 
manhandled the Kingsmen on both 
sides of the ball. Sweeper Jay New-
comer patrolled the midfield with a 
vengeance, knocking over anything 
purple while senior defender Mike 
Yen's no-nonsense tackles repeat-
edly upended the Kingsmen front 
line. 

Cal Lu's Brian Collins found that 
out the hard way. Working down the 
right side with 11:42 left in the first 
half, Yen absolutely crushed the 
Kingsmen forward with a tackle Jun-
ior Seau would be proud of. CoIJins, 
the team's second leading scorer, left 
the game with an injured ankle.
