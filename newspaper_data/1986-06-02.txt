101 the PerS<l1l <II rhc Ycar, 

Peter Irons 
Professor Peter Irons has 

taught under UC D's political 
sc ience depanment for the past 
four years , 

Irons ha been active in the 
student protest movement as a 
student and as a faculty member 
for 25 years , beginnIng with me 
Civil Rights movement , the 
Student Non-violent 
Coordinating Committee, 
Students for a Democratic Society 
and many other organizations, 
He first demonstrated against 

apanheid in front of the South 
African embassy in 1962, As a 
graduate student at Boston 
Uni ve rSIty during dle Viemam 
War, Irons organized a campus 
s trike to close the university 
down fo r severa l days after the 
Invasion of Cambodia. 

Guardian: How do you view 
your role as an educator? 

Peler Irons: Well . I think thal 
It is Important to expose 
students to a p erspective on law 
.IS a soc ial institution - to help 
to understand thal the law is 
more than Just a set of rules and 
procedures. but that it is really a 

way in wh ich society tran sforms 
values and profits of the values 
into a system regulating behavior. 
More important than 
understanding legal doctrine is 
the idea that, people should look 
at the way in which the society 
itself shapes the laws that people 
live by, 

G: What has been your 
participation with the student 
movements at UCSD - me 
Coali tion for a Free South Africa 
and the Anti -War Action 
Committee - over the past 
year? 

P.l : I have actually been 
involved over the past couple of 
years in the faculty group for 
divestment and against 
aparth eid . There is a group of 
concerned faculty , maybe 20 to 
30 people, mostly from the 
humani ties and social sciences, 
who have been working on the 
issue of divestment; and who 
have, in fact, succeeded in 
passing a Senate referendum 

" supporting divestment, But I 
~ have also been working on the 

issue of divestmem and have 
also been active aCting as an 
adviser and working with me 
students in the anti-apanheid 
movement. 

G: What suggestions would 
you make to me university to 
enhance the student college 
experience and make it more 
fulfilling? 

P.I .: Two mings: 1) Involve 
students more in university 
government. There needs to be 
avenues for allowing students to 
panicipate meaningfully in 
university decis ions, 2) I think 
that the university should 
encourage multiculturdl 
experiences by the students -to 
expose them to more cultures , 
cultures. The university I don't 
think adequately appreciates that 
we are only a few miles from the 
Third World. The vast majority 
of students on this campus go to 
Mexico just as tourists, There are 
shanties just across the border, 

and he added . "I ended up 
graduating with honors in Music 
and English . but was on 
academic probation my secon d 
year, which made me H Illore 
understanding provost." 

During his college career. 
Stewart supponed himself by 
p laying jazz Itl local nightclub s, 
but he reali zed he did not have 
the ta lenr [Q pursue his goal of 
becoming a co mposer, so he 
enrolled as a graduate stUdent in 

the Ohio Stare Engli s h 
department. 

DeSignating June 1987 as hIS 
retirement . Stewart rene ted on 
his most fulfilling experien ces at 
UCSD, "The most exciting timcs 
of my life were spent watchi ng 
MUIr College forlll . but I think 
I'm very fo rtunate in having the 
chance to develop a vari ety of 
relat io nships with students," 
Stewart said . 

Stewart said that creating the 
Contemporary Issues department 
has been o ne of his most 
enjoyable endeavors at UCSD, 

"I like going on backpacking 
trips with CI 20 (the Wilderness 
and Human Values elass) and 
putting o n co ncerts fo r students, 
It gives color and variety to m y 
life," said Stewart .

Save the trees 
Editor: 

When I came lO UCSD as .1 
freshm.ln In 1983 , one of the 
thing~ that Impressed me most 
about the school were the rows 
and rows of eucalyptus trees. 
DUring the years that I have been 
here. I have enjoyed walkIng 
through this artlflcal forest to 
classcs. I find these walks vcr)' 
peaceful and relaxing - a break 
from the monotony of lectures 
and long hours at the librar)'. I 
cannm speak for all, yet for 
mysel f. I know that places free of 
cement, glass and Wire , are 
necessary for my sanity I feel 
that these groves are an 
Important part of the UCSD 
expenence, and I hope future 
students WIll have the 
opponunlty to enJoy them as 
much as I have . 

As I have wathced UCSD 
evolve, much to my dismay, I 
have seen thesc beautiful groves 
of trees being re placed by 
bUIldings. Although this growth 
is necessary for a major 
unive rsity such as UCSD , I hope 
that mher considerations are 
being taken IntO account in the 
planning of this sc hool. It would 
be a terrible loss to have aU of 
these groves replaced by 
build ings. The largest section of 
the artificial forest planted by the 
Marines that still remains 
relatively untouched, is located 
behind Central Library, becwecn 
the Warrcn Apartments and the 
Super Computer Ce ntcr. If thiS 

grol'c was beIng conS id ered lor 
development, I would bc willing 
to fight to salT it. 

In order III cre,lte an 
dwareness among facult), and 
students of the decreasing 
number of cucalyptus trees on 
campus, a group of students in 
Contemporary Issues 20 -
WIlderness and Human Values 
- has ymbohcally posted 
notices on several of the trees 
around the school The nlers WIll

Against apathy 

What will th is campus look like on its 50th birthday? I 
Joe Watson has greatly impacted UCSD this year, and 
the effects of his efforts have made us both fear and 
hope for the future of this institution . 

We must begin to wonder what qualities our 
university leade rs should mani fest. What is the 
direction of the university community and what will its 
needs be tomorrow? The time has come for us to analyze 
the results of the actions of our officials. 

This year students have taken the initiative to 
institute their own programs, but in stead of facilitating 
student ac tions , the ad ministration has postponed 
beginning programs in whi ch students are most 
interested . 

Invest igation into women's academic and social 
needs on campus and the poss ible institution of a 
Women's Center (whi ch was due to start last January) 
has been left on the back burner all yea r long. Although 
man}' women have lobbied for research and planning, 
administrati ve commi ttees have failed to address the 
problem in a timely manner. 

Every effort should be made by the un iversity officials 
to help students organize and criticize their ideas. A 
university education should be a series of exercises in ' 
independently inaugurating projec ts which will benefit 
tli e greater community. Unfortunately, we have learned 
this year that being an active student at lhi s university 
necessarily means fighting against the bounds of official 
process. 

The admi n istration has tried to decide for us exactly 
how much we can act upon our beliefs. Joe Watson 
introduced Desmond Tutu this spring, and he 
advocated the bishop'S poliCies, but when students 
themselves tried to ac t against apartheid by building 
shanties, Watson directly and immediately opposed 
the ir initi ative. 

Watson's major concern is the reputation of UCSD. 
Instead of creating a coherent program which is 
concerned with the best interests of students, he has 
consistently promoted policies with the intent of 
impress ing conservatives outside of the UCSD 
com munity. 

Watson says that he is interested in working with 
students. But when this year's alcohol policy was being 
discussed and implemented , he completely avoided 
student input. Over the summer, university policy was 
covertly changed without including students in the 
deliberation. 

W e need our officials to advocate student 
involvement and encourage students to act. Apathy now 
runs rampant here. We must learn to become caring 
members of our community, and our administration 
should encourage us to be actors in society. We must not 
be taught to accept a controlled environment where we 
are powerless to institute change .

locused on the state's toxic 
problems can help free us from 
the threat of contaminated air 
and water. 

Californians face a $40 billion 
pricetag and alarming heallh and 
enviromental costs over the next 
10 years unless the state turns 
sharply away from its decades-
old mismanagement of toxic 
chemicals. 

Before the year 2000 an 
estimated 25,000 Cali fornians 
will die from cancer induced by 
toxic chemicals. Health care 
costs and environmental resource 
losses will total almost $14 
billion. 

The "C hemical Safety Act o f 
1986" is a bipartisan legislative 
package designed to make 
necessary changes in the way we 
manage toxics - changes that 
matter to every Californian. 

The package is the result of an 
intensive study by the California 
Commission for Economic 
Development. The commission 
looked into the staggering 
economic and health effects of 
toxic contamination and created 
recommendations designed to 
lead to a new era of safe 
chemical management. 

The seve n-bill package has the 
following goals: 
- Chemical Plant Safety -

Identify and monitor to 
minimize toxic emissions in the 
air. 
- State Superfund Reform -
Rank s ites by health threat and 
·cost explosion pote ntial." 
- Safe Drinking Water -
Demonstrate efrective 
tec hnologies to remove chemical 
contaminants from groundwater. 
- Environmental Quality 
Assurance - Promote use of 
indepenc' '1t c hemical safety 
expens. 
-lndepc'Ident Technology 
Testing - Establish unbiased 
review process for demonstrating 
efficacy of treatment 
tec hnologies, building public 
confidence in the sys tems. 
- Emergency Medical Training -
Train medical coordinators to 
safeguard health of public and 
response teams at chemical 
mishaps. 
- Safe Facilitics - Create 
res idual repositories for non-
liquid trealed waste res idue . 

This package addresses head-
on the new realities of chemical 
use in this state . Businesses fast 
are becoming aware of boltom-
line advantages in treating and 
recycling toxic chemicals. 
Citizens no longer will accept 
dumping of cancer-causi ng 
pOisons into the water, so il or 
air. 

Evidence of solid public 

support is needed to ensure 
enactment of the Chemical Safety 
Act, and involvement and 
activism by the student 
communi ty could be the key to 
getting these proposals into the 
spotlight.

Constitutional query 
Editor: 

Mary Rose Alexander's letter to 
the editor of May 27 , supposedly 
des igned to dispel "misleading 
information," is not only 
misleadining in itsel f but docs 
not deal with any of the 
accusations brought agJinst the 
Associated Students and the 
Election Boa rd , both of which 
have shown total disregard for 
the ACUCSD Constitution , the 
AS Election Bylaws dnd thc basic 
constitutio nal and democratic 
nghts of the students and 
election candidates to due 
process and eqUity. 

According to Article V of the 
ASUCSD Constllutlon . winter 
1985 , Section B, subo;ectlon a, 
"the Election ManJger shall 
appOint and chair no less than 
two (2) committces," for the AS 
elections. This prollslon is 
designed to ensure thdt the 
elections arc fair and properly

had not had time to read the 
mere cwo pages of provi sions of 
the AS Constitution rcgarding 

the~~ committees. 
Futhermore, according to the 

AS Elcctl on Bylaws, 1986, the 
election manage r must · present 
the Election Calendar a nd 
Supplementary Regulations to the 
AS for approval at least four (4) 
weeks prior to any regular 
eleclion ." Again , election 
manager RlOs admiued , dUring 
the Judi ciJry Board hearing on 
Tucsd ,IY. the 22nd, that h e had 
not had "timc" to follow thiS 
provision , by notifying the AS of 
the change m polling places 
before c hanging them . It IS quite 
clear th,1l he has no respcct for 
the AS ConstitutIOn or the 
Elect ion Byl,lws , and that be has 
no intention of even making a 
pretense of followmg them 

Furthermore, the behavlOr of 
the Associated Studcnts In 
conduumg the elections has 
been one of ignonng the 
co nstitutional nght~ of the 
election cJndldmcs (not to 
mention the democratic rights of 
the students themselves) to due 
process Jnd eqult)'. b), changing 
the elections procedures to their 
detriment and behind their 

backs. The poll ing places for the 
election, the procedures for 
determining fair reimbursement 
of candidates fo r election 
expe nses (on the whim of o ne of 
the candidates, without the 
knowledgc of th e other 
candidates), and the very 
procedurcs for numerical 
determination of the winning 
candidates, were aU changed 
without a U candidates being 
notified. If one candidate can 
request and redeve a change in 
the elec tion regulations, or if the 
AS can c hange those regulations 
secre tively and a t whim, the 
opportunities for the corruption 
of those membcrs, and for the 
violation of the basic 
constituti onal and democratic 
nghts of the sUldems, are leglOn 

If thc students have any 
respecr whatsoever for 
democracy and for thm 
constitutional nghts, they will 
remove the Associated Students 
from office and insure thaI lhe 
new elections arc held which 
uphold theIr demoCrdtlC and 
constitutional nghts If not, the 
fbgrJnt abuse of thc AS 
Constitution and the corrupt 
vlOI,ltIon of the ba~lC rights of 
the students to due process by 
the Associated Students will 
continue unabated.

were being put to trial There werc times when 
actually ignored the kindness 
rhar Ihc person wa~ shOWing me. 

And so I bargained that if my 
family could be spared this 
agony, I'd learn to accept these 
bad habits , and that I'd learn to 
accept thiS person. I didn't think 

So, [ began to think. This 
auld have easily happened to 

me . And if I had been faced with 
the possibility of having such a 
disease, it would have made no 
difference how many pairs of 
Guess jeans [ had or what kind 
of car I drove. What was going 
to matte r was the relationship 1 

I can't help wondering If It 
was all of those unkept promise!> 
which brought me a situation 
that gave me one of the worst 
scares of my life. My happy littlc 
eXistence came to a halt one day 
when I was tOld that a very close 
family member of mine might be 
In the clutches of the merciless 
disease called multiple sclerosis. 

Of course. I didn't believe this 
pOSSibility at first. Rotten things 
like that only happened to othcr 
families, not ours. The idea of 
something being scriously wrong 
with a member of my family 
seemed so unlikely that it was 
almost unimaginable . 

Being scared , hun, angry and 
powerless, the only thing I could 
do ~"IS hope . And when I found 
that hoping wasn't enough . I 
decided to try Just one more 
timc to strike another bargain . 
But I \Va~n't qUllc sure cxacdy 
what to promise. omcho\V, 
promiSing that I would stay 
home on weekends or thm I 
would not pro mstinate or that 
I'd try to control my temper 
didn't seem appropriate . I wasn't 
going to get off that easily. 

So, I looked back at the past 
couple of years and found that I 
had spent much of the timc 
hating that pcrson (the possible 
vict im) for smoking toO much . 
exercising too little and nOt 
recognizing that thiS was hurting 
mc emotionally. This person 
seemed to be under the 
misconception that as long as no 
onc else 's health was being hurt, 
it W<lS okay to go on likc thiS. 

But somehow, life has a way of 
catching everyone . .. indeed, I got caught. 

But thc reality of thiS Situation 
began to dawn on me when I 
noticed that our house was filled 
with an air of fear. A big black 
cloud had settled over our lives. 
We were being te ted . Our love 
for each other and our stamina 

[ recognized the consequences 
of these bad habits. And [ didn't 
want to have to watch someone I 

I could ever approve or like 
thcse habits , but I was going to 
have to stOp trying to change 
people. Accepti ng these bad 
habits would hurt much less than 
losing th:- person. 

The dark cloud was, indeed , 
lifted . But I don't thmk my 
bargain WJS what spared us. I'm 
surc it WclS luck. And I'm quitc 

had with my close friends and 
especially my family because 
from them . I could derive 
51 re ngth and love . 

I didn't need to strike a 
bargain or make promises 
anymore. I didn't need to force 
myself to appreCiate life. I wanted 
to do it - and that's even bener 
than a forced promise . ~

John Mar" s 'CCCI\'C~ AII -Amcnc(ln honors as a Jrc,hmoll . 

Tennis duo less 
than dynalllic 
By JOHN SCHACHT, Sp, 'rrs E:J lCor 

I T I A classic case of one man's begmning beIng another man's end. For 
Triton tennts Stars Mark 
Sandknop (a sentor) and John 
Mapes (a freshman ), thei r 
disappointing showing m the 

ationals at Claremont two 
weeks ago represents a 
watershed in both their tennis 
ca reers. WIth meir fIrSt round 
el imination In doubles and 
Mapes' Singles loss in the thIrd 
round, the Triton duo returned 
home having learned some 
valuable lessons during a 
controversial year for men's 
tennis. 

For freshman Mapes the future 
looks bright. Makl'lg his first 
appearance in the tournament, 
Mapes played a grueling senes of 
matches the first day before 
bei ng ousted on Fnday in hIS 
th ird smgles match . HIS mtenm 
coach Jim Shanback blamed a 
series of painful leg cramps and 
insufficient conditiOnIng for 
Mapes' ea rly departure . 'John 

played a very tough match at 9 
am (takIng hl~ opponent m twO 
sets , 7-5 6-4)," saId Shanhack, 
"and developed some cntmps In 
hIS second match th.l( really hurt 
hi s play later." M<lpes won that 
second match easily, defeating 
his opponent from Principia 6-3, 
6-1. 

Mapes <lnd Sandknop then 
teamed up for theIr first round 
doubles' match at 3:00 that same 
afternoon . Hmdered by Mapes' 
lack of mobihty , th e Tntons lost 
6-3, 6-4 to the eventual national 
champs , Alex Paladino and Jack 
BUlta of Kalamazoo College. 

The doubles match was 
particularly frustrating for the 
paIr, who were seeded number 
[\",0 going into the tournament 
and who had only lost one 
match all year to DIvision HI 
opponents. "One of my goals 
gOIng into the scason was to win 
a national champIOnshIp ," said 
Sandknop, who played for the 
Tritons for three years , "And 10

The cup runneth over 

So you thought the Super Bowl was a big deal. 
The Super Bowl looks like a Pop Warner game 
compared to the World Cup; the absolute 
ultimate in proessional sports. The fight for the 
Jules Rimet Trophy is so fierce , that on the day 
of the final , the world comes to a stand-still as 
close to three billion people (that's a "B" as in Big) 
watch the event on television. At last count, there 
were four and a half billion people on this earth 
(give or take a few million). Not even the Cosby' 
Show gCtS these kinds of ratings. 

How seriously does the rest of the world take 
the World Cup? Well, consider thi s: 
- After Mexico's first round elimination In the 
1978 World Cup held in Argentina , severa l 
hundred people showed up at the airport and 
greeted the team by pelting theIr plane with 
rocks. 
- In 1982, Bmzil. the favorite to WIn the Rimet 
Trophy, was up et by Italy in the semi-finals and 
over a dozen people committed SUICIde. 
- A fan from Argentina , not being ab lc to sec hIS 
tcam practice for this year's Cup, shot hImself In 
the head . 

I anonal revolts and nOts <Ire common in 
Intc rnatlonal soccer. All this adds dlmensll1n f 
excItement to a SpOrt th t ha~ faIled miserably in 
the United States. Maybe s~t:mg thIS 'car's 
version of the World Cup in a country a close 
as MeXICO will give AmerIcans a chance to se 
un ndled passion and nationalIstic fervor that 
even he OlympIC' cannot match . Maybe 
someday, real cer will rake hold of thIS 
country Instead of the pInball versIon the), ca ll 
Indoor soccer. 

This year's Cup has no clear-cut favomes.

The "Row" ed to Cincinnati 
FOR MANY AT this UnIversity, the day after finals means a trek to the 
sands of Waikiki , some Palm 
Springs sunshine or time in the 
Big Apple . But for nIne girls at 
UCSD, four days in Ci ncinnati , 
Ohi o WIll be the ultimate 
vacation. 

Obviously there are better 
places to spe nd a few summer 
days than C111c111na ti , but when 

the U.S. Rowing Collegiate 
Nationals are held there , there 's 
no other place for the women's 
novice crew. Crews from such 
schools as Harvard , Yale and 
Michigan will be represented in 
this event.

us on the crew are really excited 
about gOIng," said novIce 

member ChriSty Dueck. 'Some 
people arc saying that we might 
be outclassed going up against 
Yale and Harvard, but we Just 
want to try our best and put 
UC5D on the map."

its strength at least on the West

first round was really 
discoumging. Ir's a small 
consolation that they went on to 
win the thing (the National 
Championship). I must have 
spent 10 or 15 minutes on the 
court after the match just staring 
into the windscreen ." 

"I really felt bady for Mark," 
said his partner Mapes, "He's put 
a lot into the progmm. They 
(Kalamazoo) moved really well 
and commun icated well . I don't 
know if they were bener - it 
was just a case of my legs nOl 
being conditioned as well as they 

might havc been ." 
AnOlh er factor ci ted by both 

players was that those players 
who had qualified for Nationals 
with their team - like these 
from Kalamazoo - had been 
playing since Monday. "I think it 
was a real advantage ," saId 
Mapes. "They were used to the 

. courts and the conditions. 
Besides, at home when we 
learned that we weren't going to 
Nationals as a team , it was kind 
of hard to get court time . A 101 of 
the other guys had catching up 
to do in their studies." 

Mapes lost in the third round 
in si ngles on Friday, 6-3 , 6-1 , 
despite leading in the first se t 3-

aRdknop and Mapes received 

All-American honors for their 
doubles play, and both expressed 
mixed feelings about the year. 
"Tennis has always been a 
pastime for me ," said Sandknop, 
"a great personal outlet, but 
school has always come first. I'm 
really glad I played; I met some 
great people and some real turds 
- on both sides of the net." 

Mapes is contemplating 
tntnsferring, and has already 
recei ved offers from Abeliene 
Chri stian University in Texas 
and Cal Poly Pomona . "It's 
basically a financial thing. I want 
to go where the athletic 
department has more money, 
and I'd like a scholarship. We 
have to stri ng our own rackets 

here and pay for our own shoes, 
and it takes away from studying 
time," said Mapes. 

Sandknop was "disappointed" 
with the way the administration 
handled a mid-season coaching 
change when coach Steve MOlt 
left the team for "personal 
reasons." They could have gotten 
someone with a httle more 
familiarity with the team, 
someone wi th a little more 
experience at the college level," 
said Sandknop. Mapes fclt that 
his game improved "leaps and 
bounds" under Mott , and less so 
under Shanback. 

"I respect him (Shanback) as a 
person ," said Sandknop, "but I 
don 't fee l he knows th is level 
well enough to coach it." !ill

l~urAL SNDENT SPORTS STAFF 
They say you always save the best for last. This Is ~finitely the case for our last Miller Ute Team 
Of The W~k. Tris hlnorable group you see in front of you is ~ of the n~asons for the '.vti"er 
Ute Team Of The WI!8. Without these hearty souls dedicating themsellies to the Intramural 
Program, the program would not be enjoyed as it is. It takes quite a unique indivi<1Jal to want 
to sacrifice as rruch as they have for the 1M program. Missed classes (rig1t Matt?). bst sleep .. 
less party time and stucty time diminished. But I'm sure you INiIi all agr~ the end results have 
shlwn that they all haIIe done a great JOD. 
Special mention must be ~ to the SI)( wtIO are graauatlng on to greener pastures: 
Dan Walters (Skinny) - Has been INith us for four years. The pri~ of the TJ(E's was also 
someone we are all proud of. 
Jay Kuo ISumari) - Out of Hawilll,Jay came into our office four years ago INith a skateboard in 
hand and will leave with a diploma andt~ knowledge that he helped make our prgram better. 
Matt Adams (Professor) - A professional student whl was also a professional ~ it came to 
his job. 
Bob ArmelllC\J~) - Modesto's loss was our gain. The dude is a great f}JY and worker. 
Mike Fahltlusch (Art Schllcter) - Mike always made life interesting. Our resident A.s. member 
always got our \/Ote. 
GirlS lMlod (Glmp) - A:i good at being an SA. as ~ was at playing cards. 
Thanks f}Jy5 for all your \I\IOfk. You·re t~ Miller ute Team Of The Year.
