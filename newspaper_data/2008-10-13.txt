Chinese Officials Participate in 
Campus Education Training

By Omair Quazi
Contributing Writer

UCSD has signed a historic agree-
ment with the Chinese Ministry of 
Education to train student affairs 
officers from universities throughout 
China. 

Thirty-three officers, selected from 
a wide variety of programs and univer-
sities, have begun instruction at UCSD 
Extension for what will be a 13-week 
program.

Those participating in the program 
will study English while receiving 
instruction on how student affairs are 
structured in a higher-education set-
ting. English-language improvement is 
an essential aspect of the program, due 
to the ubiquity of English in matters 
of science, technology and business. 

Participants are expected to return 
to their native institutions with an 
understanding of student affairs in the 
United States, so as to adapt and imple-
ment similar policies within Chinese 
institutions.

Roxanne Nuhaily, director of inter-
national studies at UCSD Extension, 
was responsible for assembling the pro-
gram’s curriculum at the request of the 
China Scholarship Council, an affiliate 
of the Chinese Ministry of Education 
that provides financial assistance for 
education overseas. Nuhaily said the 
program has so far exceeded her ini-
tial expectations. She credits Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue and special assistant to the vice 
chancellor Cynthia Davalos with facili-

Revelle College Provost Daniel 
Wulbert will step down from his 
administrative post at the end of this 
academic year to return to his posi-
tion as professor 
and researcher in 
the mathematics 
department. He 
served for five 
years as Revelle’s 
academic and 
administrative 
head, and two 
years as chair of 
the Council of 
Provosts.

Wulbert’s decision to leave his 
current post stems from his desire to 
return to mathematical research. He 
has been granted a one-year sabbati-
cal from UCSD, and he will pursue 
research with a group of mathemati-
cians in India for two months. 

“It will be good for the college to 
have a new provost with fresh enthu-
siasm and creative ideas to guide 
the college in defining its role as the 
university settles in to a steady state,” 
Wulbert said in an e-mail. “I value 
and like university administration, 
but teaching and research are my

The UCSD Rebecca and John 
Moores Cancer Center received a 
$1.14-million research and training 
award from the Susan G. Komen for 
the Cure Foundation this month, a 
sum that will support four separate 
researchers’ study of the development, 
spread and potential treatment of 

breast cancer.
Komen for the Cure awarded 

$600,000 to professor of biology 
Randall S. Johnson. The donation will 
go toward funding Johnson’s project, 
“Hypoxic Response and Inflammation: 
Role in Breast Cancer Progression,” 
which will focus on the relationship 
between low oxygen levels in tumors 
and inflammation in breast cancer 
progression.

Each of the other three researchers 
received $180,000 awards. 

Professor and chair of cellular and 
molecular medicine Marilyn Farquhar 
will use the funds for a project called 
“The Role of Giv/Girdin and G 
Proteins in Metastatic Progression of 

Breast Cancer.” Farquhar and her team 
will research the role played by a spe-
cific group of proteins in the spread of 
breast cancer. 

The funding will support research 
by postdoctoral fellow Mikel-Garcia 
Marcos in the area of endocrine ther-
apy. 

Also performing research in 
the area of endocrine therapies for 
breast cancer will be postdoctoral fel-
low Weizhou Zhan, funded by the 
$180,000 awarded to professor of 
pharmacology and pathology Michael 
Karin, in UCSD’s Laboratory of Gene 
Regulation and Signal Transduction. 

That team will conduct their 
research under the “Role of lkk/

Nf-kappab/BMi-1 in Mammary 
Carcinogenesis and Metastasis” grant, 
focusing on a group of enzymes that 
potentially affect the development and 
spread of breast cancer.

Professor of medicine and Howard 
Hughes Medical Institute investigator 
Michael G. Rosenfeld also received 
$180,000 to fund the grant titled 
“Tumor-Associated Macrophage-
Mediated Inflammatory Responses in 
Serm ‘Resistant’ Breast Cancer as a 
Therapeutic Target.” This award will 
support research by postdoctoral fel-
low Chunru Lin, who will study the 
role of inflammation in treatment-

The Future Will Have a Touchscreen

By Sarah Alaoui
Contributing Writer

The SAT’s already highly debated 
role in college admissions received 
another blow late last month with 
the release of a national report that 
found the test does little to accurate-
ly measure an applicant’s academic 
potential.

Released by the National 
Association for College Admission 
Counseling on Sept. 23, the report 
urges universities nationwide to 
begin placing less weight upon 
SAT scores in considering applica-
tions to their respective institutions. 
Entitled “The Use of Standardized 
Tests in Undergraduate Admission,” 
the report questions the value of 
the SAT in admissions, alleging that 
the examination does not cater to 
students of all socioeconomic back-
grounds.

NACAC Director of Public 
Policy David A. Hawkins said in a 
Daily Spectator article that the study 
was undertaken with the intent of 
illustrating to national universities 
just how unnecessary the SAT may 
be in judging ability. 

“The commission certainly sug-
gested that there are more colleges 
that could probably go test-option-
al,” Hawkins said. “That is all part of 
the effort to invite colleges to take a 
closer look at why they are requiring 
the use of standardized tests.”

Most universities now require  
SAT or other standardized test 
scores in addition to other applicant 
information, such as GPA and a 
resume of extracurricular activities. 
The report emphasizes that the SAT 
is a poor criterion for determining 
a student’s ability to perform well 
in a college setting, finding the test 
to be more a measure of parental 

education level or a student’s ability 
to afford SAT tutoring. 

According to the report, the test’s 
“one size fits all” comprehension 
of applicants fails to recognize the 
strengths and capabilities of each 
individual student. It builds upon 
the common student complaint that 
the SAT does not fully represent 
their intellectual abilities and leaves 
them shorthanded in their college 
applications. While standardized 
tests offer less academically oriented 
students an opportunity to dem-
onstrate their intellectual abilities, 
such examinations may also be a 
disadvantage to those who perform 
well in classes but are unable to 
achieve a high SAT score due to an 
aversion to testing. 

In addition to the alleged failure 
of the test to reflect future academ-
ic potential, the report also finds 
that  standardized testing often does 
not adequately reflect the academic 
requirements of individual universi-
ties. Public and private institutions, 
the report says, both large and small 
in scale, each cater to varying types 
of students and therefore should not 
accept applicants based on a single 
universal test. 

Dean William Fitzsimmons of 
Harvard University Admissions 
and Financial Aid revealed in late 
September that his university would 
likely consider an eventual removal 
of the SAT from its rigorous admis-
sions criteria, basing his prediction 
in part on the findings contained 
within the NACAC report. 

In responding to the report’s 
findings, the College Board, the 
corporation responsible for pro-
ducing and administering the SAT, 
released a statement claiming that it 
would collaborate with universities 
to ensure that the test continues to 
provide admissions officers with a 
fair and objective evaluation of a 
student’s projected academic per-
formance.

Scientists at UCSD’s Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography have 
discovered that a genetic mutation is 
likely responsible for the creation of 
weak “hybrid” offspring that results 
when species of marine crustaceans 
called copepods diverge and then 
reconnect. 

Hybrids, which are produced 
when a species that has separated 
and gone through genetic muta-
tions while apart reconnects and 
interbreeds to create offspring, often 
exhibit symptoms of weak evolu-
tionary fitness such as lower fertil-
ity levels, slower development and 
higher levels of mortality. 

The new research described 
by Christopher Ellison and Ronald 
Burton of the Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography is published in 
this week’s online edition of the 
Proceedings of the National Academy 
of Sciences.

Ellison and Burton have been 
studying copepods of the species 
Tigriopus californicus for the past 
several years by breeding speci-

mens from different locations and 
observing the hybrid specimens in 
their environments during high and 
low tides. They found that certain 
genes that usually allow copepods 
to manage the stress caused by 
rapid change in salinity levels dur-
ing tide were not activated in the 
hybrids, leading to low surivorship.

“When the incompatibility [of 
genes in hybridized populates] 
affects something as central as 
cellular energy production, as in 
Tigriopus, it is not surprising that 
hybrids show slower growth and 
reduced reproduction and survivor-
ship,” said Burton, a professor in the 
Marine Biology Research Division at 
Scripps. “In addition to informing us 
about evolutionary processes, this 
research has important implications 
for a variety of biomedical and agri-
cultural practices, such as stem cell 
production and cloning of domestic 
animals.” 

Former UCSD professor and 
Nobel laureate George Palade died 

at his home on Oct. 7 after a long 
battle with Parkinson’s disease.

Professor emeritus of medicine 
and cellular and molecular medi-
cine and founding dean for sci-
entific affairs at the UCSD School 
of Medicine, Palade, 95, was con-
sidered the father of modern cell 
biology. 

“We are saddened by the 
death of our respected colleague,” 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox said. 
“Dr. Palade had a tremendous 
impact on the course of science, as 
well as a personal impact on count-
less colleagues and students who 
were inspired by his teaching and 

his example. His legacy will certainly 
live on in the work of so many bril-
liant scholars who benefited from Dr. 
Palade’s guidance and wisdom.”

Palade shared the 1974 Nobel 
Prize in Physiology or Medicine with 
Albert Claude and Christian de Duve 
for discoveries in the understanding 
of cell structure and function. 

He used the newly invented 
electron microscope to better study 
cells, which led to his discovery of 
the ribosome, and helped develop 
the technique of cell fractionation, 
which allows for the components of 
cells to be broken up and studied 
individually.

resistant breast cancer and as a possible 
target for therapy.

The $1.14 million is part of the 
2008 portfolio of grants being dis-
tributed by Komen for the Cure. The 
sum of the awards, which will support 
scientists in the United States as well 
as internationally, comes to a total of 
$100 million distributed throughout 
81 universities and hospitals located in 
27 states and five countries. Following 
a strict application process, Komen 
distributed the awards based on the 
scientific soundness of the received 
proposals.

“The application process follows 
a pretty detailed procedure — we ask 
scientists, doctors and institutions 
to submit requests for funding with 
detail about what they’re studying and 
what they believe their study should 
answer,” Komen for the Cure Director 
of Communications Andrea Rader 
said. “This is peer reviewed — that is, 
a team of scientists, medical doctors 
and advocates meet to review what the 
applicant is proposing.”

Komen for the Cure takes special 
interest in projects that are likely to 
provide concrete results and that can 
be more quickly translated into medi-
cal assistance for patients.

“We base our judgments on several 
criteria, including whether the peer-
review group believes that the science 
behind the proposal is sound,” Rader 
said. 

The grants awarded to the Moores 
Cancer Center researchers are the only 
research and training awards of their 
kind that Komen for the Cure has 
granted in San Diego this year.

tating contact between the Chinese offi-
cials participating in the program and 
the UCSD Office of Student Affairs.

“The participation, enthusiasm and 
warm welcome of our campus admin-
istrators has been gratifying,” she said. 
“It has made me proud.”

UCSD has a history of opening its 
doors to foreign scholars looking to 
continue their research and broaden 
their academic scope abroad. Six years 
ago, communication was initiated with 
the Chinese Ministry of Education to 
eventually allow for Chinese scholars 
in the fields of science and engineering 
to observe American professors teach-
ing at UCSD, in a push to improve their 
own scientific and technical teaching 
methods in China.

“They really enjoyed and appreci-
ated the style of American professors 

in terms of engaging the students,” 
Nuhaily said. 

Students noted that impromptu 
discussions, in-class humor and pro-
fessors’ loose adherence to lesson plans 
differed from the Chinese approach to 
instruction in similar fields. 

Participants in the program hail 
from top-ranked Chinese institu-
tions, such as Shanghai Jiao Tong 
University, Tsinghua University and 
Fudan University. The selection pro-
cess for the program at UCSD was rig-
orous and competitive. Unlike earlier 
exchanges, current participants repre-
sent a broader set of fields, including 
nonscientific disciplines. 

UCSD was selected as the pro-
gram’s host institution in part for its 
high rankings in both the social and 
physical sciences. 

“We are on their radar screen as a 

[noteworthy] campus,” Nuhaily said. 
Henry Devries, communications 

director for UCSD Extension, said 
the program’s exchange of ideas and 
culture falls in step with Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox’s mission to interna-
tionalize UCSD. 

“One of the things that UCSD 
wants is local impact, national influ-
ence and global reach,” he said. “This 
will open up doors for partnerships 
in the future with UCSD and Chinese 
universities.” 

Nuhaily will visit China next 
month to report on the success of the 
program and gather input regarding 
similar partnerships that incorporate 
U.S. teaching practices into Chinese 
education systems.

exactly how long I will stay on leave 
or where I will locate.” 

As Revelle’s provost, Wulbert 
oversees the college’s various aca-
demic programs with the goal of 
maximizing every’s student’s educa-
tional experience. His many duties 
include facilitation of student-orga-
nization activity and oversight of 
advising, general-education cours-
es, writing programs, housing and 
events such as orientation and grad-
uation. Wulbert also works closely 
with other college provosts in moni-
toring campuswide undergraduate 
programs and the 
general under-
graduate curricu-
lum.

Additionally, 
Wulbert initiated 
a program last 
summer to teach 
the third quar-
ter of the Revelle 
H u m a n i t i e s 
sequence in 
Rome, since it 
discusses the 
Renaissance. He 
also collaborated 
with Associate 
Vice Chancellor 
for Academic 
Affairs Barbara 
Sawrey to orga-
nize a seminar 
for new faculty 
on teaching at a 
research univer-
sity and — in conjunction with Ross 
Frank of the ethnic studies depart-
ment — designed a program to 
recruit and mentor students applying 
for the country’s most prestigious 
fellowships and graduate awards.

Incoming students may be 
most familiar with Wulbert’s work 
as the chair of the committee that 
redesigned the Welcome Week 
Convocation this year, which was 
attended by over 3,000 incoming 
students. He has also worked to gen-
erate scholarship support for under-
graduates, serving as founding chair 
of the Scholarship Committee for the 
past five years. 

Wulbert reflected on some of the 
challenges in store for his replace-

ment as provost.
“The university has doubled in 

size and grown from three to six 
colleges since I came here,” Wulbert 
said. “With changes that dramatic, 
the university struggles with deciding 
which functions are better delivered 
centrally and which are best deliv-
ered from the colleges. Similarly, we 
in the colleges struggle with deciding 
in which ways the colleges should be 
similar to each other and in which 
ways we should exhibit individuality 
— even idiosyncratic individuality.”

However, Wulbert is critical that 
the six distinct sets of general-edu-
cation requirements set unfair and 
overspecific standards for its stu-

dents.
“My college 

requires a year 
of calculus — a 
requirement com-
pletely inappropri-
ate for everyone at 
an academically 
c o mp r e h e n s i v e 
university of our 
size, and Sixth 
College is devel-
oping require-
ments that only 
an elite small col-
lege would dare to 
attempt,” Wulbert 
wrote.

Wulbert also 
expressed a con-
cern for student 
d i s s a t i s f a c t i o n 
with campus life. 
He has identified 
several factors 

leading to this discontent, includ-
ing the lack of a vibrant city district 
adjacent to the university, a lack of 
four-year on-campus housing and a 
more science-oriented, studious stu-
dent demographic than observed in 
other universities.

Wulbert entered administration 
gradually, initially entering UCSD 
to conduct research in mathemat-
ics. He chaired Revelle’s Curriculum 
Committee for over 10 years, co-
developed several undergraduate 
courses and served as acting provost 
at Thurgood Marshall College for a 
total of two years.

Personality 
Quirks Don’t 

Define a Leader 
If you’ve had a chance to follow any coverage of the presidential campaigns this year, you have 
undoubtedly received a heavy dose 
of information about the candidates’ 
personal lives.

Some of this information can be 
used in forming logical opinions 
about the candidates. Sen. Barack 
Obama was editor of the Harvard 
Law Review, an elite position that 
requires both intelligence and the 
ability to embrace responsibil-

ity. Sen. John McCain fought in the 
Vietnam War and was held prisoner 
for over two years, no doubt instill-
ing in him a mental toughness and 
perseverance few situations could 
replicate. Gov. Sarah Palin rose to 
fill the top position in the Alaskan 
government, all the while helping to 
raise five children, certainly proving 
an impossible work ethic and perse-
verence. Joe Biden was elected to the 
U.S. Senate at the tender age of 30, 
up to the task of demanding deci-
sion-making even in his most young 
and restless years.

Unfortunately, the Democratic 
and Republican conventions also 
provided us with information com-
pletely unbeneficial to the process 
of selecting the next leader of our 
country. Obama experimented with 
drugs when he was young (yes, stu-
dents at Harvard like drugs, too). 
Palin is an apparent expert at driving 
her children to hockey practice — 
and equally good at driving strange 
young men back home from hockey 
practice. McCain apparently has no 
idea how many homes he has.

Examples are endless. To most 
Americans, these biographical facts 
may seem like simple par for the 
course, but if one looks deeper, they 
reveal an obsession voters have with 
the personal lives of candidates — 
a huge distraction from the more 
pressing issues at hand. 

Part of this problem is the ridicu-
lous length of the campaigns them-
selves. The current candidates have 
been on the campaign trail for over 
a year, still with three weeks left 
until Election Day. I’m still waiting 
for either Obama or McCain to strap 
a camera to his head and star in his 
own reality show. Laugh now, but I 
think “Barrack’s House” would be 
a hit.

As, always, the media also plays 
a huge role. Networks are keen-
ly aware that their viewers crave 
carnal knowledge about the com-
petitors, never hesitating to pump 
us full of monotonous drivel. The  
American public simply must know 
how much Sen. John Edwards pays 
for a haircut, or the cost of McCain’s 
footwear of choice. These are clearly 
matters of national security.

The 2008 presidential election 
has been particularly telling of our 
society’s obsession with political 
persona. Obama has garnered such a 
fervent following that he has under-
gone a sort of deification in some 
circles.

Disunion

By Reza Farazmand
Senior Staff Writer

NATIONAL NEWS — Just last 
week, the UCSD Police Department 
released its annual Clery Campus 
Security Report, a comprehensive 
list detailing the number of times 
that crimes of various natures were 
recorded on campus over the period 
of one year.

The report — required for all 
universities participating in federal 
loan programs — allows students, 
parents, faculty and any other inter-
ested parties open access to this 
information, theoretically granting 
the public a necessary degree of over-
sight regarding our campus security 
forces while offering a glimpse into 
the sorts of illicit activities that are 
taking place at our university. 

The problem, however, is that the 
report, released this Oct. 1, offers 
readers information about crimes 
that occurred only between January 
and December of 2007 — so, any 
incident you might read about in 
this report is at least eight months 
old. 

Eight months. That’s almost as 

long as the human gestation peri-
od. In the time it takes the cam-
pus police department to compile, 
organize and publish this report, 
a child could be conceived and 
born, a man could walk from San 
Diego to Portland and back again 
and Lionsgate Entertainment could 
release six more installments of the 
“Saw” franchise. It’s like watching 
the vice presidential debates eight 
months from now and thinking, 
“My god, we really must do some-
thing about this Palin woman.” 

To be as succinct as possible: eight 
months is a long-ass time, and by the 
end of all that time a lot of crimes 
have happened, occurrences that 
likely affect the sort of bearing this 
report’s information actually has on 
current campus crime activity. The 
information contained within the 
Clery report is not timeless — and, in 
essence, absolutely useless.

So what exactly is this report 
supposed to be? A historical record? 
A glimpse into the past? Or perhaps 
a mode by which to fondly recall 
bygone days? What sort of insight, 
other than meaningless retrospect, 
are we the public meant to gain 

by reviewing incidents that most 
people have probably forgotten by 
now? 

Our own campus police chief, 
Orville King, said in a recent inter-
view with the Guardian that the 
report does little to influence law 
enforcement at UCSD. In his own 
words, “While Clery reports activ-
ity of the previous year, our police 
department tracks activity in real 
time to try and identify and respond 
to trends as they develop.”

In a perfect world, the Clery 
report would be released at the 
beginning of each school year, 
detailing crime information com-
piled over the course of the previous 
academic year. This would allow us 
the opportunity, as informed citi-
zens, to review the types of crimes 
reported, observe any trends in 
these occurrences and subsequently 
voice our concerns to the powers 
that be. By delaying the release of 
the report an entire eight months 
past the conclusion of the period in 
question, the report becomes noth-
ing more than an outdated docu-
ment with a whole lot of numbers 
that have absolutely no influence on 

the day-to-day activities of campus 
law enforcement. 

Of course, our local campus 
police department isn’t to blame for 
the utter uselessness of this report. 
The Clery Act is a piece of federal 
legislation, and its policies and reg-
ulations are determined by a much 
higher power than UCSD’s finest. 
The stupidity of this report is sim-
ply a testament to our nation’s love 
affair with convoluted bureaucracy 
and stalling the release of any infor-
mation that could actually prove 
useful or interesting to the public. 

If the Clery report is to remain 
a requirement for our country’s 
universities, it should at least be 
one that doesn’t waste everybody’s 
time and money with the reporting 
of meaningless, outdated informa-
tion. Let’s keep Clery around, but 
in a manifestation where it might 
actually contribute to informing the 
public and assisting our law enforce-
ment officials. Until then, we might 
as well be reading last year’s news-
papers.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
— The scene is reminiscent of a B-
list action flick: anonymous masked 
intruders sneak into some impor-
tant building, scrawl crude hand-
written threats demanding unreal-
istic accommodations and leave an 
incendiary device meant to detonate 
the next morning as employees walk 
in for their daily shifts, before flee-
ing into the night.

Unfortunately for many UC sci-
entists and students, situations like 
these are very real and come at the 
hands of backward, crazed organiza-
tions such as the Animal Liberation 
Front, which is filled with screw-
ball activists who among other 
actions advocate the release of lab 
animals nationwide via intimidat-
ing and often frightening guerilla 
tactics meant to incite fear among 
researchers.

In fact, several failed fire-bomb-
ings aside, high-profile instances of 
violent backlashes by animal-rights 
activists against UC personnel 
within the last few years include 
the flooding of a UCLA researcher’s 
home with a garden hose — an 
action that caused nearly $30,000 
in damages — and a terrifying inci-

dent in Santa Cruz during which 
a scientist’s husband was attacked 
by a group of intruders who inter-
rupted her daughter’s birthday party 
demanding the researcher cease her 
lab’s groundbreaking breast-cancer 
studies.

Letters filled with razor blades, 
firecrackers set in mailboxes and 
vandalism are common tactics used 
by ALF goons to intimidate scien-
tists, and it was just last December 
that animal-rights operatives called 
in a bomb threat at UCSD’s Leichtag 
Biomedical Research Building, a 
stunt that forced the FBI to evacuate 
the entire School of Medicine and 
shut down a large portion of cam-
pus before ultimately being deemed 
a hoax.

The sad reality is that the groups’ 
extremism is getting progressively 
worse, with some militants who 
formerly only protested the use of 
nonhuman primates and dogs now 
calling on labs to stop using fruit 
flies in their experiments.

Responding to these increas-
ingly brazen moves, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger signed into law 
this month a long-overdue measure 
to shield scientists from attacks by 

animal-rights activists, finally safe-
guarding the welfare of hundreds of 
researchers who use animal subjects 
in their laboratories and providing 
more stringent oversight of personal 
information used by groups such 
as ALF to carry out the cowardly 
attacks.

Specifically, the legislation pro-
tects statewide academic research-
ers, which it deems as “any per-
son lawfully engaged in academic 
research who is a student, trainee or 
employee of UC, CSU, an accredited 
California community college or a 
Western Association of Schools and 
Colleges accredited, degree-grant-
ing, nonprofit institution.” 

By granting protection to stu-
dents in addition to researchers, law-
makers have successfully proved that 
they are serious about putting a stop 
to these militant zookeepers, at last 
shielding the most vulnerable targets 
— future scientists who might oth-
erwise be scared away from the field 
— from potential harm.

Moreover, the law forbids the 
publication of private information 
about — and physical appearances 
of — researchers and their imme-
diate families with the intent to 
commit a violent act or threats of 
violence, and against trespassing on 
scientists’ private property to com-
mit such crimes, while also increas-
ing penalties for offenders.

The University of California is 

an institution driven forward by its 
scientists, who secure grants and 
eventually publish their work, in 
effect branding the university’s name 
across academia. Animal research 
is always conducted humanely 
and only when absolutely neces-
sary, while experimental protocol is 
strictly outlined by federal govern-
ment regulations. From antibiotics 
to joint replacement, the vast major-
ity of modern-day medical tech-
niques dictating the treatment and 
control of disease are derived from 
knowledge gained by the results of 
experiments that used laboratory 
animals. The new law will permit 
scientists to continue this important 
work without worrying about their 
cars being fire-bombed.

Animal-rights extremists por-
tray scientists as vicious torturers, 
but that assertion is ludicrous; these 
researchers have dedicated their 
lives to finding new medical break-
throughs meant to improve the lives 
of both humans and other animals. 
By signing this law, Schwarzenegger 
has proved his commitment to mak-
ing sure these vital experiments con-
tinue. Hopefully, the lunatics from 
ALF and similar groups will realize 
that their pet projects will now lead 
them straight into the waiting jaws 
of law enforcement officials.

New Study-Abroad Program 
Lacks Organization 

Dear Editor,
The 2008 Costa Rica Global 

Seminars study-abroad program was 
memorable and was an experience 
none of us will forget. However, the 
program was the product of misleading 
advertising by shoddy, money-mind-
ed administrators. Issues arose before 
we even embarked on our journey. 
Orientation information implied that 
scholarships and financial aid would be 
easily obtained and costs would not be 
a problem. Later, we were told that we 
didn’t qualify for aid and the fees were 
nonrefundable. By then we had paid 
nearly $3,000 of the required $5,000.

The administrators provided us 
with a breakdown of costs — which 
consisted of our tuition, housing and 
program fees. What they did not tell us 
(until billing) was that we were to also 
pay a “Special Summer Session.” We 
later discovered that we were paying 
for the University Center and recre-
ation facilities. But being in Costa Rica, 
how could we take advantage of these?

The Global Seminars representative 
was rude, uninformative and unhelp-
ful. When students had problems, they 
were told to go check the Web site or 
deal with it themselves. Polite assis-
tance rather than snippy responses 
would have been appreciated.

In Costa Rica, the list of admin-
istrative grievances increased. 
Communication between UCSD 
and Centers for Academic Programs 
Abroad (our study-abroad provider) 
were poor. We paid for five weekend 
excursions but only received three. We 
were informed on the day of two of 
these trips that we needed to buy our 
meals. Several of us didn’t carry enough 
money so our professor, Milton Saier, 
paid. Upon reaching our destinations, 
we were twice told that the excursion 
fees were unpaid.

Our homestay families were not 
paid adequately and tour guides some-
times vanished; we paid $3,500 for this?  
Painfully, a group from Mississippi 
told us they had paid only $1,000 
per person for similar excursions. We 
asked the CAPA representative for a 
breakdown. The reply: only UCSD had 
the information; later, UCSD told us 
that CAPA had it. It was then that we 
realized where most of our money had 
gone: administration.

Global Seminars Need a 
Budget Makeover

Dear Editor,
This summer, 31 students and I 

went to Costa Rica where I taught in 
the UCSD Global Seminars program. 
While we felt it was a worthwhile 
experience, there were major prob-
lems.

1. One of the students had already 
taken one of the classes offered, but 
she still had to pay the course fee. Two 
students discovered after signing up 
that the expenses would cause finan-
cial hardships; they were not offered 
a refund.

2. Global Seminars administrators 
were not willing to fund a teaching 
assistant. Although I had empha-
sized the importance of having a TA 
months before departing, my request 
was denied.

3. The students had paid $3,500 
to cover expenses (excluding flight, 
personal expenses, etc). The study 
abroad provider, Centers for Academic 
Programs Abroad, paid for only three 
weekend excursions. Furthermore, in 
two of the three excursions, meals 
were not fully covered.

4. Students were housed with 
Costa Rican families and conditions 
were often squalid. The host families 
were paid slave labor wages by U.S. 

standards. As a result, sickness was 
a major problem; only four students 
didn’t get sick, some being ill for up to 
two weeks with strep throat, flu, colds, 
ringworm and of course Montezuma’s 
revenge.

5. CAPA lacked facilities in Costa 
Rica, so it hired another organization, 
Costa Rica Spanish Institute, a Spanish 
language school. Although several 
students wanted to take Spanish, no 
funds were provided.

6. Students wondered where their 
money went but were told that this 
information was not available. Upon 
returning to UCSD, Global Seminars 
administrators were equally unre-
sponsive.

7. Information provided was some-
times conflicting: At UCSD (after stu-
dents had paid the fees and could 
not get refunds) they were told that 
absolutely no alcoholic beverages or 
“inappropriate behavior” (not defined) 
would be tolerated. Moreover, it was 
my responsibility to police them. Then 
once in Costa Rica, we were told by 
CAPA that San Jose had great bars that 
we should take advantage of.

8. At the end of our first week, we 
knew that we didn’t want to spend the 
full five weeks in San Jose, but CAPA 
decided otherwise.

9. When still in San Diego, I was 
asked if I wanted a one-bedroom 
apartment or a larger one. Since family 
members wanted to visit, we agreed to 
pay over $1,000 extra. However, once 
in Costa Rica, we were told that any-
one who stayed with us would have to 
pay an extra $50 per day. 

10. My wife planned to join us on 
excursions, but we were told that she 
couldn’t unless we paid an additional 
$1,200. For three weekend excur-
sions?  

Frustrations abounded since we 
felt we’d been ripped off. The Global 
Seminars and CAPA administrators 
gave us the impression that they were 
PRIMARILY interested in money, not 

students. There must be a better and 
less expensive way to go abroad than 
having Global Seminars administra-
tors arrange the trip.

Triton Fridays a Group 
Project to Boost Spirit

Dear Editor,
My name is Peter Benesch and I 

am the A.S. associate vice president of 
athletic relations. I’m writing to express 
my concerns with a recent article titled: 
“Triton Fridays: Another Misguided 
Publicity Stunt.” There were several 
inaccuracies in the article, as well as 
several questionable assessments that I’d 
like to take issue with.

The article mentions that the project 
is a waste of Triton Tide’s money and, 
by association, the A.S. Council’s activ-
ity fee, particularly with reference to the 
“toys” we’re giving away. Unfortunately 
this is completely false. No A.S. fees 
have been spent to acquire the iPod 
Touch or the Wii we will be giving 
away, it was completely funded by the 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs. Rue 
fronted the money because she believed 
there was real potential for this project 
to spark a new tradition at UCSD.

At the very beginning of the article, 
it states that Triton Fridays is Triton 
Tide’s newest campaign. In reality, this 
is incomplete at best; the event was 
actually planned by me in my capac-
ity as AVP Athletics. Triton Tide has 
volunteered its time and effort to sup-
port the project because the members 
believe in what it stands for, but they are 
not the only ones. Members of the A.S. 
Council, the athletes themselves and 
even the college councils have stepped 
up and volunteered to help; without 
their help the event would not have 
been able to happen. So if you wanted 
to bash on Triton Fridays, you’d have to 
start with me, then Rue and then go on 

to ALL of the groups involved. To casti-
gate one support group to the exclusion 
of all others seems completely inappro-
priate to me.

The article calls the event a “raffle” 
and that students will win the “toys” by 
coincidentally wearing blue and gold. 
This is just plain wrong: it’s a contest, 
the most spirited people will win the 
large prizes. We are giving away calen-
dars (which have the dates of athletic 
events for a majority of the academic 
year) to all who participate but no one 
who just happens to be wearing blue 
and gold will have a chance in hell of 
winning the Wii or the iPod Touch.

The end of the article suggests that 
Triton Tide should give away prizes to 
students who come to athletic events 
wearing blue and gold. This comment 
demonstrates a complete lack of under-
standing of the purpose of the event. 
The event’s primary purpose was to 
increase school spirit among ALL stu-
dents at UCSD. As hard as it may be 
to believe, many students are apathetic 
about athletics (as the AVP Athletics, 
it’s especially difficult for me to under-
stand this). Thus, Triton Fridays are an 
effort to reach out to all students and 
foster a sense of school pride regard-
less of their inclinations about sporting 
events.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lazaro

Kansas. A menthol-smoking com-
munity organizer who attended 
Columbia and Harvard. A hand-
some young man who speaks so 
silky smooth that if he ever fails in 
politics he would instantly have a 
lucrative career in commercial narra-
tion. Sounds like Abraham Lincoln’s 
second coming just dropped down 
from heaven.

Thus far, the focus on Obama’s 
personal life and appearance has 
worked in his favor. In essence, his 
lack of experience in the higher 
ranks of government has led the 
public at large to home in on and 
celebrate useless facets of his per-
sonality — never mind his economic 
plan or how he figures to provide 
universal health care.

Don’t get me wrong: Obama’s 
ability to inspire is extremely impor-
tant to public participation. Neither 
candidate will be able to implement 
policies that are 100-percent effec-
tive, but if the next president can 
force individuals to take the well-
being of the country upon them-
selves, that may be more than any 
policy could ever achieve. But if vot-
ers are turning all their attention to 

home-life details instead of trying to 
understand the issues he’s attacking, 
this country may be in for a world 
of hurt.

I believe most people would 
claim that while they certainly 
notice these juicy little nuggets of 
information, they are not shallow 
enough to let them shape their final 
sophisticated opinions. Despite this, 
nearly every time I witness some-
one engage in political conversation, 
the focus inevitably boils down to 
meaningless factoids. An informed 
political debate constructed solely 
on character-free issues is truly hard 
to come by.

This problem is perhaps best per-
sonified with the “who would you 
rather have a beer with?” voter. You 
know, the guy who at the bar who 
says he is standing by the policies of 
President George W. Bush because 
he would be a great guy to knock a 
few back with. And you know what 
— this guy’s right. There is no doubt

Just north of Malibu during the summer of 2006, percussionist and UCSD music professor Steven Schick encountered a curious home-
less man who inquired what he was doing. To the 
homeless man, who had spent 18 years of his life 
roaming among those streets, Schick was no ordi-
nary passerby — he wore a large backpack, tennis 
shoes and a hat, and appeared unruffled by his 
busy surroundings. Schick explained that he was 
traveling from San Diego to San Francisco by foot, 
listening to and recording the sounds of California. 
Along his journey, Schick continued to leave a 
wake of inquisitive, bewildered or — more often 
— envious witnesses. 

“The romantic notion of a one-way trip is 
important to them,” Schick said. 

Long determined to make the trek, Schick was 
propelled by two key motives. Foremost, he wanted 

to experience the changing sounds of California 
firsthand, questioning whether music can be found 
in one’s natural surroundings or whether it’s all just 
useless noise. 

In a confusing world filled with sounds, Schick  
is acutely aware of the unremitting interference 
of our technologies, often numbing us to noise. 
Frequently used electronics like laptops, stereos, 
cellular devices and televisions tend to distract  
from the detection of enviornmental sounds. 

“I couldn’t help but notice that everyone uses 
iPods wherever they go, blocking things out,” 
Schick said. “What if we listen to outside noises the 
same way we listen to Mozart’s Quartet?” 

His second reason for traversing the coast of 
California was unrelated to his quest for musical 
enlightenment — he wanted make a courtship ges-
ture to his fiancee, who lived in San Francisco.

At one point in the trip, while sitting in a cafe 
in Santa Maria, a psychiatrist questioned his men-
tal well-being for voluntarily choosing to take the 

trek. Schick responded, “[You] should tell all your 
patients to try this.” For him, walking over 20 
miles a day, alone with his thoughts, was of 
therapeutic caliber.

The idea of taking a long walk had 
always fascinated Schick. He recognized 
that great men had walked in medita-
tion before — John Muir 
walked from Indiana to 
Florida when he was 30, 
and Martin Luther King, 
Jr. marched from Selma to 
Montgomery, Ala., during 
the civil rights movement. 
He casually mentioned the 
idea to his students dur-
ing a lecture the previ-
ous spring quarter. Schick 
recalls quickly refuting the 

Ifirst learned the rules of Washington while studying American government in high 
school. One book, required reading 
for the class, taught me more about 
our political system and the media 
than any class I’ve taken before or 
since, and it still stands smartly on 
my bookshelf. What I didn’t know 
when I read the book six years ago 
was that I would one day intern for 

its author, personally learning the 
ins and outs of Washington from a 
veteran in the political game. 

The book was called “Hardball,” 
and its author is Chris Matthews. 
The rules inscribed in the book break 
down national politics in no-non-
sense logic, and most are easy to 
memorize — if hard to exercise: it’s 
not who you know, but who you 
get to know; don’t get mad, don’t 
get even, get ahead; and only talk 
when it improves the silence. Secrets 
and schemes are peppered through-
out the text, and I’m sure if there 
had been an interesting lesson to be 
learned from a sexual escapade,  even 
that account would have been used. 
Unfortunately, the book was origi-
nally published before the Lewinsky 
scandal. 

Matthews now has his own show, 
also called “Hardball,” on MSNBC, 
and his mantras and methodology 
still intrigue me, aspiring political 
journalist that I am. So when I applied 
to intern at the National Broadcasting 
Company in Washington, I hoped 
that my cover letter and resume 
might land on his desk, giving me 
the chance to play the game of hard-
ball myself.

QUID PRO 
QUO: THE 

PRESS AND 
POLITICIANSA t the distribution center, four docks fill with trucks unloading their goods — custom sweatshirts, snack foods, 

shampoos, textbooks, greeting cards, iPods — 
all eventually headed to the UCSD Bookstore, 
where student employees will sift through the 
rubble, stocking various product departments 
on an hourly wage. 

Similar products find their way to smaller 
vendors next door though on a scale more in 
tune with the stores’ stature. Products placed 
on cramped shelves of the campus co-ops go 
through the hands of little-paid communal 
workers, or even unpaid volunteers.

Of the three textbook sellers on campus 
— the UCSD Bookstore, Groundwork Books 
and the General Store Co-op — the UCSD 
Bookstore in Price Center is easily the most 
visible. Because of this, it gets more criticism 
from students, as well as more business.

“I know it’s cheaper to buy books online, 
but some people don’t get their books [deliv-
ered] until [a few weeks] into the quarter, 
so it’s more convenient to buy them at [the 
UCSD Bookstore],” Eleanor Roosevelt College 
junior Kevin Staight said. “Price Center is so 
much easier and it’s central.”

Textbooks are the one item in the bunch 

that offer students almost no choice in selec-
tion. Professors make the call and we bow 
to their better judgment, but while students 
have little say in what to purchase, we can still 
decide where and why.

“I prefer purchasing books at Groundwork,” 
said Chris McCoy, an Eleanor Roosevelt 
College junior and an Associated Students 
senator. “It focuses more on social justice and 
progressive issues and it’s not just the UCSD 
corporate model; it’s a lot different.” 

Owned by UCSD, the bookstore reports 
to Business Affairs rather than Student 
Affairs, which Price Center management and 
University Centers fall under. At UCLA, a 
bookstore run by Associated Students is able 
to use profits for student activities, but also 
to receive funding from student fees. Here 
at UCSD, student funds do not provide for 
the UCSD Bookstore’s operation, but conse-
quently, proceeds never make their way back 
to students other than through the store’s ser-
vices, allowing it to maintain capital for future 
expansion of inventory or repairs.

Part of that difference is in management. 
While the UCSD Bookstore is corporately

Yes, they will be 
on campus soon! 

at all odd hours of the week for 
most of last year, I was able to build 
off that experience and my career 
— as an unpaid intern for the show. 
And let me say, watching the game 
on a broadcast is a lot different 
from watching it in the home team’s 
dugout. 

The first day I walked into the 
“Hardball” office, I immediately 
noticed the full-size cutouts of Sens. 
Barack Obama and John McCain 
plastered on an office window, 
standing so close to one another I’d 
swore they were best friends. Every 
day, the two oversee handfuls of 
national magazines and newspapers 
that are delivered and stacked neat-
ly for the researchers, producers, 
guests and anchors to easily peruse. 
Television monitors are stationed 
at every desk, where live political 
coverage from all the NBC channels 
— NBC, CNBC, MSNBC and the 
local affiliates — streams through 
the room like a lifeline. Computers 
are connected to the wire service, 
which updates every few seconds 
with breaking news from all over 
the country, categorized thoroughly 
by topic. 

I knew that the industry was 
fast paced from my time at the 
Guardian, but this was a whole 
different league. There’s a lot of 
preparation involved for an hour of 
television, but just as much impro-
visation. Here, if you don’t hit the 
ground running, you’ll get caught 
with your pants down, and unlike 
former President Bill Clinton, you 
won’t be able to get out of it. 

I thought I was used to this pace 
by the time I introduced myself to 
our host. So when he walked over 
to my desk and asked me what I was 
doing, I knew that he wasn’t inter-
ested in what was on my computer 
screen. I was ready to prove myself. 
Looking up at him with a half-

smile and a furrowed brow, I asked, 
“What would you like me to do?” 
He paused for less than a second 
before stating, “Good attitude. I like 
that. Can you get me a large coffee?” 
Needless to say I was promptly put 
back in my place, lesson learned: 
I’m still just a benchwarmer.

My tasks throughout the day 
put me in direct contact with the 
producers and guests as I assist in 
researching the latest news and 
numbers coming from the White 
House, the Capitol or the cam-
paign trail. I run tape feeds to “30 
Rock,” the office in New York, and 
coordinate guest lists in time for 
the 5 p.m. edition of “Hardball.” 
I’ve already met most of the NBC 
anchors and correspondents, like 
Andrea Mitchell, Norah O’ Donnell, 
David Shuster and Chuck Todd, 
as well as the show regulars who 
come in the form of strategists, his-
torians and journalists — people 
like Todd Harris, Steve McMahon, 
Howard Fineman and Joan Walsh. 
I’ve even had the chance to meet a 
few politicians, notably Rep. Brian 
Bilbray from San Diego who asked 
me how often I visit Black’s Beach 
and seemed unsurprised when I 
informed him that it was a nude 
beach. “Not legally, of course. I 
never passed legislation on that,” he 
told me with a wink.

It was surreal to watch this same 
seemingly friendly and engaging 
congressman walk briskly into the 
studio, where two minutes later his 
face filled my monitor and quickly 
turned shades of red as he and the 
anchor battled it out over the nature 
of the financial rescue package and 
how it would impact the economy. 

But that’s the catch when it comes 
to the media and politicians: they 
make up a balanced coexistence that 
is neither appreciative nor pretty. 
My favorite rule from my well-worn 
“Hardball” text was one that Richard 

Nixon articulated from experience: 
“The press is the enemy.” Most poli-
ticians and public figures are either 
immediately wary of the press and 
keep their distance or else they learn 
to do so the hard way. 

However, my time at “Hardball” 
has proven that the relationship 
between politicians and the press 
is much more intricate. Sure, politi-
cians hate the media and, for the 
most part, the media hates them 
back. The producers of the show 
groaned when they discovered that 
the secretary of treasury sched-
uled an evening press conference 
without warning, because it meant 
they needed to pull strings to get 
more coverage of whatever it was 
he needed to say. “Does he have to 
wait until the last minute to give 

this conference? What’s the hold-
up?” our host demanded. Although 
Secretary Henry Paulson probably 
didn’t mean to ruin the early start 
of the weekend for our staff, he 
needed the media there to cover his 
speech. He might have earned more 
brownie points with the media if he 
had done it a little earlier. 

Local and national politicians 
face the same dilemma when it 
comes to the media, but if they know 
how to work the situation, it doesn’t 
have to be painful. The Obama or 
the McCain campaigns might have 
their gripes about the MSNBC cov-
erage of the day, but their numbers 
are on speed dial and they send 
spokespeople to the studio every 
chance they get. The McCain cam-
paign has already complained about 

the unfair line of questioning and 
biased filter that the “liberal media” 
uses against Gov. Sarah Palin. And 
on “Saturday Night Live,” Tina Fey’s 
flawless impersonation of the vice 
presidential candidate probably isn’t 
helping her public image, but it’s 
getting coverage. Palin is already 
booked to appear alongside her tele-
vision persona for an episode of 
SNL just a few weeks before the 
election, because in the end, she 
needs the coverage as much as Fey 
needs her to say ridiculous things 
— proving yet another lesson found 
in “Hardball”: politics make strange 
bedfellows.

notion, which prompted his students 
to ask, “Well, why not?”

“I couldn’t see a reason [not to], 
except for the fact that it was nuts 
— but obviously that didn’t stop me,” 
he said.

Schick covered 700 miles by 
foot in nearly six weeks. His travels 
began in a McDonald’s parking lot in 
Imperial Beach and concluded as he 
crossed the Golden Gate Bridge and 
slapped the Marin County sign.

Because he was walking up and 
down hills for long distances at a 
time, Schick had to be cautious about 
what he packed. Every ounce could 
make a difference in his physical con-
dition at the end of the day. When he 
originally reached Los Angeles, after 
setting out with only the clothes on 
his back, he was called back to San 
Diego a few days later for work. He 
made a detour by renting a car from 
Los Angeles International Airport 
and driving back home. But, that 
first stretch ended up helping Schick 
determine which essentials he needed 
to bring along for the rest of the jour-
ney: when he picked up where he’d  
left off, he brought a backpack filled 
with extra clothes, food and water. 
Schick spent his evenings in different 
motels, where he did his laundry and 
kept in touch with  friends and family 
with his cellular phone. 

According to Schick, the most 
difficult part of the trip was the act 
of walking on the highway, particu-
larly the Pacific Coast Highway 101, 
where roads are narrow and cars veer 
dangerously along cliffs. He recollects 
the importance of making eye contact 
with every driver so that he or she

Joseph Stubbs, a former Revelle 
College student from the mid-’70s, 
still remembers the time-honored 
UCSD tradition of streaking after 
the organic chemistry final. He also 
remembers the Watermelon Drop. 
Most of all, he recalls the simplicity 
of the university’s campus during its 
early years. 

“We used to joke about the Central 
Library — we called it the not-so-
central library,” Stubbs said. “At the 
bottom of Revelle they had a deli 
place and a foosball game and that 
was about the extent of it, and the 
bookstore was simply that, where you 
got your books.” 

Stubbs also reminisces about the 
openness of the campus and sur-
rounding areas that he experienced 
during his undergraduate years. 

“In 1971, the AAU Cross Country 
[Championship] race was held right 
next to where the Central Library 
is because there were just open dirt 
roads,” Stubbs said. “Now it’s just 
completely grown over and expanded 
miles east of the campus where there 
was nothing. You kind of miss that but 
I guess growth and progress — you’ll 
never be able to stop it.” 

Currently a Chula Vista resident, 
Stubbs, in revisiting the campus and 
La Jolla years after his time at UCSD, 
noticed the physical changes that the 
area had undergone.  

“[La Jolla’s] become so much more 
congested,” Stubbs said. “When we 
went there you could zip down and 
get to La Jolla and get back out so eas-
ily because there was nothing there. 
The area around UCSD was just open 
land and it kind of made it a special 
place because it was a college up onto 
itself.” 

However, Stubbs believes that 
while La Jolla’s population growth has 

made student transportation more of 
a struggle, the university has still been 
able to retain its old charm. 

“It’s bigger but a lot of the things 
still remain the same,” Stubbs said. 
“[It has] maintained its beauty even 
though [it has] grown so much. It has 
maintained its open spaces.” 

Meanwhile, Rafael Andrade, a 
former Thurgood Marshall College 
student, has noticed changes curbed 
toward the university’s social respon-
sibility. 

Andrade recalls a sit-in he attend-
ed with his peers in order to institute 
the name Emiliano Zapata for the col-
lege now named Thurgood Marshall, 
which in the ’70s was still just Third 
College.

Although the sit-in did not prove 
ultimately successful, Andrade feels 
as though such political and social 
student activity has somewhat faded 
from the overall campus atmosphere.

“It seems to me that we have got-
ten a lot more conservative,” Andrade 
said. “Back in the ’60s and ’70s, there 
was a strong student movement and 
students were a lot more politically 
involved, at least when I visited. I don’t 
really see a lot of Hispanic movement 
as much as I used to.”

Also, as Andrade attributes his 
educational opportunity to minority 
outreach programs, he questions the 
strength of such programs in today’s 
system. 

“Back then they [gave] a lot more 
opportunities to minority students 
through equal opportunity,” Andrade 
said. “I don’t know how effective that 
program is now, because I under-
stand it’s very hard to get into UCSD. 
When I got into UCSD back then, I 
was able to get in because of the pro-
grams available to minorities.” 

However, UCSD’s social and phys-
ical campus environment is not the 
only aspect to have been affected by 
the university’s growth over the past 

50 years. 
Allan Havis, provost of Thurgood 

Marshall College and La Jolla resdi-
ent of 20 years, has seen how the 
university and its extensions, such as 
the La Jolla Playhouse, have fostered 
the town’s growing culture. 

“It’s clear that the university and 
the playhouse are at least half of what 
powers the city,” Havis said. “The Old 
Globe is partnered with UCSD, and 
there are smaller theaters, but the 
three major equity companies are in 
the lead and a lot of our faculty and 
graduates feed into the network.”

As a playwright and professor, 
Havis has witnessed the absorbing 
of art from metropolises such as Los 
Angeles and New York, which he 
believes has made La Jolla what it is 
today.

“The playhouse and the univer-
sity have brought in a tremendous 
amount of enrichment from those 
areas [and] turned a navy retirement 
town into a much more cosmopolitan 
community,” Havis said. 

Also, Havis notices even minor 
points of culture that have been 
affected by the university’s influence 
on the surrounding areas. 

“The journalism in La Jolla has 
changed because of the performing- 
arts dynamics on campus,” Havis 
said, adding that there were “fewer 
coffeehouses and poetry readings.”

However, in reminiscing about his 
own dynamic undergraduate experi-
ence in New York City, Havis would 
have preferred the campus to be 
located in an area more accessible to 
a local, active town. 

“To get out of the separateness of 
the campus, you’d have to walk a few 
miles to get to an actual village; if we 
had that kind of intersection there’d 
be a little more stimulation and cross-
pollination of going to school and 
seeing people going to work at the 
same time,” he said. “But we can’t 

change the geography. We have to 
work with what we have.” 

Paul Churchland, professor 
of philosophy at UCSD and Valtz 
Philosophy Chair, has been a part of 
the university since 1984. For him, 
what stood out about UCSD’s devel-
opment was the formation of the 
cognitive science department in the 
late ’90s. 

“Scholars of all departments 
and of different research interests 
got together,” Churchland said. “We 
formed an interdisciplinary com-
munity that still exists to this day. 
People at UCSD don’t appreciate how 
there’s a lot of interaction between the 
department boundaries.” 

Although Churchland remembers 
a period of recession, his memory 
of UCSD’s development is generally 
positive. 

“I remember back in the early 
’90s when we had an economic turn-
down,” Churchland said. “We all had 
to agree to a 5-percent pay cut right 
across the board, everyone in the 
university. The building paused for 
a little bit until the budget turned 
around. But mostly its been growing, 
the number of students, I think. Also, 
the university’s ranking nationally 
slowly climbed, the quality of people 
that were here slowly improved as 
the university grew, and we weren’t 
in the top 25 when [my wife] and 
I first got here in ’80s. It flourished 
academically.” 

Overall, Churchland notes that 
UCSD’s effect on the surrounding 
community has been constructive. 

“I think the effect on northern 
San Diego has been profound. All the 
things you’d hope a university would 
do, we’ve been lucky enough to do,” 
he said. “This is one hell of a place 
to be.”

could acknowledge his presence. 
“I knew which driver was on the 

cell phone from far away, and they 
were the most dangerous,” Schick said. 
There were times when he had to dive 
into bushes along the road to avoid 
getting hit by a car. In Big Sur, clumps 
of poison oak among the bushes made 
this more difficult.

But Schick’s musical journey began 
long before this coastal ramble. He 
was raised on his parents’ farm in 
Iowa, where at the age of four, he 
decided to take piano lessons. Flipping 
through the Yellow Pages one day 
Schick found a picture of a piano, 
dialed the telephone number beside 
it and asked the perplexed stranger at 
the other end of the line to teach him 
how to play the piano. 

His interest in percussion gradu-
ally developed in school. Schick stud-
ied at the University of Iowa, where he 
developed an interest in contemporary 
percussion that engaged both tradi-
tional and experimental instruments. 

Schick is certainly not the only 
musician to examine the sounds of 
the outside world and bring them 
into the concert hall. For 10 years he 
was a part of Bang on a Can, a con-
temporary organization in New York 
of musicians who shared his interest 
in unconventional sound. The group  
members used mallets to bang on cans 
and incorporated sirens and whistles 
into their pieces.

“At some point when I was hitting 
things, inevitably I was going to hit 
something else,” Schick said.

Aside from a decade spent in 
New York, Schick also stayed in 
Geneva, Switzerland, for four years 
and served as Artistic Director of the 
Centre International de Percussion de 
Genève. Currently, Schick teaches var-
ious seminars and a symphony course 
at UCSD. He additionally took the 
position of music director and con-
ductor of the La Jolla Symphony and 
Chorus two years ago after making a 
name for himself by founding percus-
sionist ensemble Red Fish Blue Fish 
and teaching a wildly popular course 
on the Beatles. 

During those six weeks of walk-
ing, Schick observed the way different 
social settings can take on distinctive 
rhythms. He was fascinated by how 
sounds changed as he passed from 
subculture to subculture.

In more urban settings, he noted 
how the air filled with steady man-
made noise, saturated with the sound 
of automobiles, people and airplanes 
overhead. 

“The only thing you notice is when 
something stops happening, when 
there is a brief moment of repose or 

silence,” Schick said to KPBS host Tom 
Fudge at the midpoint of his excur-
sion. Once a week, Schick would call 
These Days, a KPBS morning show, 
for a series of interviews that informed 
the San Diego community of his dis-
coveries along the way.

He noted that in rural areas, partic-
ularly Big Sur, there existed an every-
day backdrop of noise that often went 
unheard by people in the city, namely 
birds, insects, wind and surf. 

“Along the coast, where there are 
very little motorized sounds, [the pass-
ing car] becomes the event,” he said.

Suburbs like San Diego and San 
Luis Obispo had their own ebb-and-
flow tempo, waves of silence and pass-
ing traffic. There was no steady hum 
of automobiles or unbroken noise of 
nature. Instead, the air was punctuated 
by sounds of both.

With each day that passed Schick 
became attuned to previously unoticed 
harmonies. When walking through 
Marine Corps base Camp Pendleton, 
for example, he heard a recording of 
“Pomp and Circumstance” for a sixth-
grade graduation overlapped by the 
firing of machine guns and tank artil-
lery on a nearby range. On the road, 
he sometimes found himself drawing 
a connection between the sounds he 
was hearing and certain parts of famil-
iar compositions he knew and appre-
ciated. At a certain field in Oxnard, 
Schick associated the sound of sprin-
kler heads clicking on and off as metal 
percussion instruments from Iannis 
Xenakis’s Persephassa. 

Schick did some recording on his 
trip, though he admits they pale in 
comparison to the live experience. He 
made a tape at the end of one tiring 
day in a bustling restaurant, where the 
clattering of voices and Willie Nelson’s 
voice overhead provided a warm back-
ground. However, when he replayed it 
later, Schick realized it sounded almost 
raucous. Other listeners would not be 
able to identify with the traveler’s ach-
ing feet, the pleasures of sinking into 
a chair or hearing the voice of his 
father’s favorite musician playing over 
the speakers.

Schick met the end of his trip with 
conflicted feelings, joined by his fian-
cee and one of his students during the 
last couple hundred feet. After crossing 
the Golden Gate strait, Schick called 
his friends and family on his phone to 
inform them of the commemorative 
moment. Despite the sense of accom-
plishment, Schick could not help but 
feel sorrowful. 

“[Even as I finished], the road kept 
going,” he said.

14 FOCUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 13, 2008

modeled and oversees 190 lower-
level student job positions, the co-
ops are an experiment in com-
munity. 

According to the Groundwork 
Books Web site: “The co-ops are 
not-for-profit organizations that 
provide students, faculty, and staff 
at UCSD with the highest qual-
ity merchandise and services at 
the lowest prices possible. [They] 
are an educational experiment in 
nonhierarchical organization. All 
members of the UCSD community 
are invited to participate in this 
experiment.”

All proceeds from Groundwork 
Books go to the UCSD Co-op 
organization, helping to sustain 
the system as well as provide for 
the general-stock books available.  
According to the Web site prices 
are set as low as possible in an 
attempt to “provide off-beat alter-
natives to the items and the atmo-
sphere offered by mainstream cor-
porate UCSD.”

While the UCSD Bookstore sets  
a 25-percent profit margin before 
discounting books, Groundwork 
exceeds the recommended retail 
price set by publishers on less than 
1 percent of texts. 

“The suggested retail price is 20 
cents on the dollar,” Groundwork 
Textbook Co-Coordinator Rudy 
Duran said, noting that the increase 
is an increase on the price paid 
directly to the publisher and doesn’t 
account for the cost of shipping. 

Regardless of the difference in 
profit margin, neither store should 
receive the same textbook orders 
from professors. Some depart-
ments, such as ethnic studies, 
tend to order their books through 
Groundwork only.

“We ask professors not to order 
through both the [UCSD] Bookstore 
and Groundwork,” Duran said. “But 
we’re not interested in competition 

with the Bookstore; we’re not seek-
ing to stop them from existing. 
We’re interested in general stock 
— textbooks just keep the store 
afloat.” 

A third campus vendor, the 
General Store Co-op, competes 
directly with the UCSD Bookstore 
for sales, and guarantees lower 
prices on the same materials. To 
facilitate this, the UCSD Bookstore 
provides a list of the textbooks 
ordered through them to the 
General Store.

“It makes life easier,” UCSD 
Bookstore Director John Turk said. 
“If we don’t do that there can be 
an interruption to the universi-
ty system. Our mandate is not to 
monopolize. It is to provide service 
to students.”

However, the General Store tries 
to stock texts that have sold well in 
the past.

“We stock mainly science books 
based on past sales and student 
enrollment,” General Store staffer 
Jeff Wang said in an e-mail. “We 
generally stick to books that had 
high demands.”

But when it comes to pricing, 
the General Store does its own 
research.

“We check at the bookstore and 
online to make our prices lower, 
and we try to stock as many used 
books as possible,” Wang said. 

Due to limited space, the 
General Store is not able to offer 
the same vast selection as the UCSD 
Bookstore. But it can keep prices 5 
to 25 percent lower, because — like 
the UCSD Bookstore and unlike 
Groundwork Books — the General 
Store is not dependent on text-
books for survival. 

“We stock the books that the 
[UCSD] Bookstore sells because we 
want to give the students a cheaper 
alternative to buy books,” Wang 
said. “The bookstore charges unrea-
sonable prices for the required texts 

because they know students will 
buy [them] there. We provide our 
business not to gain profit but to 
stick it up to the Man, basically. We 
want the students to know that the 
bookstore isn’t doing business for 
the sake of them.”

The university is largely sup-
portive of the co-op lifestyle and 
keeps rent low for both the General 
Store and Groundwork; however, 
like those at the UCSD Bookstore, 
operating costs play a large role in 
sustaining business and all three 
have recently undergone expansion 
and construction.

Instead of renting the space like 
all other retailers in Price Center, 
the UCSD Bookstore owns its prop-
erty within the center, including 
the new Sunshine Market in Price 
Center East and Perks, the cafe 
located on the northwest corner.

“Conventional wisdom thinks 
that we’re connected with Price 
Center, but that is just not true,” 
Turk said.

While student-approved fees 
paid for the expansion of Price 
Center, the UCSD Bookstore’s 
expansion was self-funded. A con-
tract creating a multiple-income 
source for Price Center’s construc-
tion and expansion separated the 
bookstore from the university as 
a business. The bookstore itself 
boasts newly expanded electronics 

and textbook sections, as well as 
more space for supplies, clothing, 
gifts and home and bath products.

“This expanded area, if success-
ful, will allow us to pay the debt 
on expansion and construction,” 
Turk said. 

Turk also noted that the book-
store will now be able to extend 
its hours, pay for the higher cost 
of using paper and canvas bags (in 
a push to eliminate plastic) and 
expand inventory.

“We get a lot of student input 
and we are listening; students want-
ed longer hours, and there is a push 
for sustainability,” Turk said. “We 
are trying to answer demand.”

Staff at the General Store Co-
op, however, have complaints about 
their new facility.

“Around two years ago when 
we were at Groundwork’s new 
location, we used the room where 
KSDT is now located to sell books,” 
Wang said. “That area was very 
advantageous to our textbook busi-
ness because it’s in the heart of the 
old Student Center and a short-
cut where all students had to walk 
through if they want[ed] to get 
from Revelle or Muir to the other 
colleges. But now we are located 
on the outskirts of the old Student 
Center where no one can see us 
unless they are going to the pub or 
the Grove.”

With the popularity of buy-
ing books, and not just textbooks, 
through online vendors like 
Amazon and Half.com, indepen-
dent bookstores have been shutting 
down. 

But with an expanded space 
— even if not ideally located — 
and a wide selection of products, 
neither the UCSD Bookstore nor 
the General Store is too danger-
ously threatened by the external 
pressures plaguing all book-only 
outfits, though both noted a recent 
decline in textbook sales.

If it weren’t allowed to sell text-
books, Groundwork Books would 
have a much harder time main-
taining operations and offering 
students the alternative business 
model.

“We’re really interested in stu-
dents having a voice in the business 
on campus and experiencing a non-
hierarchical work environment, but 
we have a need for life, so we sell 
textbooks,” Duran said. 

McCoy is one of many students 
who have enjoyed this alternative. 

“I just like the feeling of 
Groundwork better,” McCoy said. 
“It feels so much more corpo-
rate at the UCSD Bookstore. [At 
Groundwork] it’s more of a home 
feel.”

Nevertheless, as an A.S. senator, 
McCoy is interested in finding a 
way to use textbooks as funding for 
student activities. 

“I’m trying to see how A.S. can 
run a bookstore,” McCoy said. “It 
would be the most self-sustaining 
way to put money back into the 
student body.”

UC Berkeley used a student-run 
bookstore model in the past similar 
to UCLA’s. But while UCLA’s book-
store — which McCoy noted as an 
inspiration to his idea — has been 
a success, UC Berkeley’s store was 
eventually leased to a private party 
after the student body failed to pro-
vide adequate service and refused 
to hire professional management.

With a wealth of current options 
and the possibility of future addi-
tions to on-campus textbook pur-
chasing, it all comes down to stu-
dents, professors and vendors to 
decide which business model, price 
and location they prefer. Options 
may be limited in purchasing text-
books, but they’re not in where, 
when and how we purchase.

CROSS COUNTRY — Drawing on 
momentum from their excellent 
seasons thus far, both the men’s and 
women’s cross country teams posted 
second-place victories during the 
Triton Classic, held on Oct. 11. The 
men’s 10,000-meter event proved 
to be an explosive start for Alaska 
Anchorage as five of its runners 
placed in the top 10. Nevertheless, 
UCSD put in a powerful run as 
junior Jesse Morrill led the way 
for the Tritons and raced toward 
the finish line with a time of 32:34 
to ultimately claim seventh place. 
Fellow Triton senior Jake LeVieux 
clocked in shortly thereafter with a 
time of 32:41, placing ninth. 

“They are amazing,” senior and 
men’s captain Daniel Anderson 
said of his teammates Morrill and 
LeVieux. “They’ve been working 
together all season, pushing each 
other, and they have really stepped it 
up to improve from last year.”

Anderson, who was the top over-
all finisher in the 2007 Triton Classic, 
did not race Saturday because of a 
recovering ankle injury.

Distinguished by numerous turns 
and a hilly terrain, the UCSD home 
course proves a challenging track 
for most harriers — an important 
advantage for the Tritons as they are 
set to host the NCAA West Regional 
in November. 

“We know our course well,” 
Anderson said. “It’s a really excit-
ing course and we try to push to the 
top of the hills and run the turns 
very fast.” 

In a field of 126 runners, fresh-
man Bre Schofield and senior captain 
Ashleigh Montgomery displayed an 
obvious knowledge of the course as 
they blazed ahead for UCSD in the 
women’s 6,000-meter run. Clocking 
in at 22:23, Schofield garnered 
eighth while Montgomery, at 22:50, 
pushed for ninth. Schofield, who has 
had a stellar rookie campaign thus 
far by placing within the top 10 at 
all of the Tritons’ events, credits her 
steady focus along with her mental 
and physical self-motivation.

“When I’m running, I focus on 
what I’m going to do and tell myself 
things that will keep me going,” she 
said. “With those things you can’t go 
wrong because you have it locked in 
your head that you’re never going 
to give up.” 

Amassing 62 points for the men’s 
event and 61 points for the women’s, 
the Tritons were able to win dual 
second-place finishes — a high-note 
ending as they enter their two-week 
break before the conference cham-
pionships in San Bernardino on 
Oct. 25. 

“We will train hard and recover 
when we need to,” Schofield said. 
“This will give us time to work 
toward our goals and treat our bod-
ies well. We will definitely study the 
course and work together as a team. 
On and off the course we are going 
to be there for each other and be 
ready.” 

Following the conference cham-
pionships, UCSD will host the 
NCAA West Regional meet on Nov. 
8.

MEN’S SOCCER — The UCSD 
men’s soccer team traveled to Cal 
State Stanislaus on Oct. 10 looking 
to get back on track after a three-
game winless streak. Unfortunately, 
the Tritons were unable to over-
come poor playing conditions and 
an early deficit, falling 1-0 on the 
road. The loss dropped the Tritons’ 
overall record to 6-4-2 and their 
conference record to 3-4-2. The 
loss leaves UCSD in fourth place in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association South Division with 
11 points, trailing leaders Cal State 
Los Angeles, who sit atop the table 
with 22 points. 

The Warriors got on the board 
quickly, scoring the lone goal of 
the match during the 11th minute 
of play. Warrior defender Trevor 
Grimbley won a header at midfield, 
playing the ball into Triton terri-
tory, where forward Jose Velasquez 
was able to squeeze a goal between 
the legs of normally reliable senior 
goalkeeper Peter Akman. While the 
goal may not have been pretty, the 
Warrior defense made it stand up 
and secured three points for the 
home side. The Warriors’ win looks 
even more impressive considering 
Cal State Stanislaus was playing 
a man down for over 30 minutes 

after defender Thomas Janz was hit 
with a red card.

UCSD has now gone four match-
es and over 400 minutes of play 
without posting a goal. The frus-
tration has been magnified due to 
the fact that the offense has looked 
much cleaner over the last several 
matches. The Tritons have created 
their share of chances, outshooting 
the Warriors by a mark of 14-9. 
However, none of that mattered for 
the Tritons as they were unable to 
put the ball in the net for the fourth 
straight match. The Tritons will 
need to score goals in bunches in 
their upcoming games if they hope 
to make a push for a spot in the 
conference tournament.

Even though head coach John 
Pascale was proud of the way his 
team played against the Warriors, 
he pointed to execution problems 
as the cause of the Tritons’ down-
fall.

“We pretty much had control for 
most of the game but just couldn’t 
put one away,” he said. “We had the 
ball in their end for large portions 
of the game but had bad execution 
in front of the goal.”

Senior forward Tommy Caplan 
agreed that the Tritons will need to 
do a better job attacking on offense 
if they want to score goals going 
forward.

“We need to be a little more 
focused in the offensive third,” the 
Triton captain said. “It seems like 
we get a little nervous and have 
trouble executing plays.”

five wins and a draw in their first

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — At the 
halfway point of the conference 
season, the No. 15 UCSD women’s 
volleyball team has really started 
to click. After struggling to put full 
games together, the Tritons appear 
to be reaching their potential. 

With a durable defense and 
an offensive barrage, the No. 15 
Tritons swept their two weekend 
matches, dominating Sonoma State 
25-15, 25-12, 26-24 on Oct. 10 and 
dismantling Humboldt State the 
following night 25-17, 25-21, 21-
25, 25-21. The victories improved 
UCSD to 14-3, 8-2 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association, 
good for a tie for first place with 
Cal State San Bernardino, which 
lost to Cal State Los Angeles on 
Oct. 11.

The Tritons improved to a per-
fect 8-0 all-time versus Humboldt 
State after their victory on Oct. 
11. UCSD looked to be playing in 
peak form, despite the best efforts 
of the scrappy Lumberjacks (6-11, 
4-6 CCAA). 

The Tritons cruised in game 
one, scoring the first five points 
and staying ahead 14-7 after a kill 
by sophomore middle blocker Cara 
Simonsen. UCSD would lead by at 
least four points for the remainder 
of the set, taking the win on a kill 
by freshman outside hitter Hillary 
Williamson. 

In the second game, UCSD fell 
behind 15-11 and had to contend 
with Humboldt State’s resiliency 
while fighting to tie the game at 
19. Not letting the Lumberjacks get

In its last three games, the women’s soccer team has not allowed a single goal from its opponents.

Senior outside hitter Rebecca Bailey set the UCSD career record for kills with her 1,183rd kill in UCSD’s game

out of hand, the Tritons buckled 
down and finished strong. Senior 
outside hitter Kimberly Carpenter 
was a major factor in UCSD’s lead, 
and she finished the set with the 
final kill.

 The Lumberjacks came out 
strong in the third game and never 
trailed. Down 15-19, UCSD fought 
back to tie the match at 20, but 
Humboldt was able to force two 
UCSD attack errors and did just 
enough to take the set. 

The fourth game was without 
question the hardest-fought set of 
the night. There were nine ties and 
five lead changes, including one 
late in the game when the Tritons 
rallied off five straight points after 
trailing 20-19. Leading 24-21, 
junior setter Elaine Chen finished 
it off for the Tritons with a delicate 
touch-kill to end the match. On 
the night, the Tritons were paced 
by junior outside hitter Sylvia 
Schmidt, who tallied 13 kills and 
five digs, while senior outside hit-
ter Rebecca Bailey and Williamson 
each recorded eight kills. 

The Tritons seemed to have 
Sonoma State (15-4, 7-3 CCAA) 
scouted out perfectly in the first 
game, as they scored 10 of the first 
14 points and led handily through 
most of the set. Bailey, in pursuit 
of the UCSD all-time career kills 
record, totaled six kills in the open-
ing game, including the final three 
kills, and was a major motivator for 
the Tritons. Head coach Tom Black 
felt that his team performed well 
considering its opponent’s abili-
ties.

WOMEN’S SOCCER — Head coach 
Brian McManus said his team has 
now entered the most difficult part 
of the season.

With five of their last seven 
games on the road, the Tritons are 
going to make their playoff push 
away from the comfort of RIMAC 
Field. 

To make matters even more dif-
ficult, this will be the first extended 
road experience for the freshmen. 

While they now have the experi-
ence of on-field competition, seven 
players, including some of those 
freshmen, will have to take quizzes 
on the road. McManus said that 
while this can be distracting, his 
players can handle it. 

“There are no dummies at 
UCSD,” he said. “Our athletes do 
well and get good GPAs. Other 
schools can’t do it. These bright 
kids work to our advantage on the 
field.”

If the team was distracted, 
it didn’t show on Oct. 10 at Cal 
State Stanislaus. The Tritons and 
Warriors battled for 86 minutes 
before senior midfielder Laura 
Borenstein broke through in the 
scoreless game.

team recorded two 
shutout wins over the 
weekend to regain sole 
possession of first place.

Zatarain placed the UCSD corner 
kick into the box where freshman 
forward Sarah McTigue one-timed 
it to Borenstein for what would be 
the game-winning goal. 

UCSD had the overall edge in 
the match on the offensive with 15 
shots to Cal State Stanislaus’ nine. 
Eleven of the Triton shots came in 
the second half, and senior goal-
keeper Jessica McGovern tallied 
four saves while earning her fifth 
shutout of the season.

The win brings the Tritons’ 
overall record to 10-2-1 and their 
conference record to 7-2-0. They 
again own sole possession of first 
place in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association after Cal State 
San Bernardino ended its game in 
a tie. 

Chico State was next up for the 
Tritons on Oct. 12, and the Tritons 
continued their winning ways with 

“Sonoma is a good team so 
we were happy with our success,” 
Black said. “The first two games I 
thought we executed really, really 
well. We had some adversity in the 
third game with the service line but 
we responded well.”

Holding the momentum after 
the first game, UCSD continued 

to attack the Seawolves behind the 
play of senior defensive special-
ist Michelle Torres. Trailing 5-7, 
Torres served up 10 straight points 
as part of an 11-0 run for the 
Tritons, which brought the score 
to 16-8. From there, UCSD never 
looked back, finishing the set with 
an outstanding .469 attack percent-
age with 16 kills against just one

error. 
Without realizing it at the time, 

Bailey’s kill to give the Tritons a 
24-12 advantage was record-set-
ting. With 1,183 career kills, Bailey 
took over the UCSD record previ-
ously held by former Triton Stacy 
Dunsmore, who totaled 1,182 kills 
in her career from 2001-04. 

“I didn’t even know that I had 
broken it when it happened, but 
I was extremely excited when I 
found out,” Bailey said. “It’s some-
thing that takes all four years to 
achieve and not just a game. I think 
that there are going to be other 
players that will work hard after 
me and will probably break it, but 
I get to hold it for a while which is 
really special.” 

In the third game, the Tritons 
were in control 14-10 when Sonoma 
State started chipping away at the 
lead. The Seawolves tied the set at 
20 and 24, before Bailey and fresh-
man outside hitter Katie Condon 
put away the last two points for 
UCSD. 

As a team, the Tritons hit a 
season-high .408 clip, the highest 
percentage since 2004. They were 
paced by record-setter Bailey, who 
finished with a match-high 19 kills 
on .486 hitting and Condon, who 
recorded eight kills on .615 hit-
ting. Chen continued to be an on-
court leader, chipping in 45 assists, 
six digs and two kills. After the 
game, Black attributed much of the 
Tritons’ success to their prepara-
tion.  

“We had a pretty specific scout-
ing report and the girls did a great 
job of following it,” Black said. 

The Tritons look to continue 
their winning form next week when 
they travel to Cal State Dominguez 
Hills on Oct. 16 and Cal State Los 
Angeles on Oct. 17.

a 3-0 victory over the Wildcats. Of 
the two teams, UCSD has domi-
nated the head-to-head matchup, 
winning seven of the last 10 face-
offs with the Wildcats.

Three different Tritons scored, 
helping UCSD hold its lead over the 
Wildcats. Senior forward Natasha 
Belak-Berger notched her team-
high ninth goal of the season with 
junior midfielder Alexia Zatarain 
and freshman forward Alexa-Rae 
Navarro also adding scores for the 
Tritons.

With only five games remain-
ing, UCSD will have to do what it 
has already done well this season: 
win on the road.

MEN’S TENNIS — The Tritons 
started action this year at the 
Wilson/ITA Small College Regional 
Championships, an individual 
singles and doubles tournament 
that guarantees the winners a spot 
at the prestigious ITA National 
Championships. The tournament, 
hosted by Cal Poly Pomona, took 
place on Oct. 2 and Oct. 3. The 
Tritons are in the midst of replac-
ing veterans Eric Rubens and Blake 
Meister, who won the doubles title 
last year and earned a spot at the 
National Championships.

Coach Eric Steidlmayer was 
quick to admit that it will be tough 
to replace those two, but said he 
feels the Tritons still have plenty 
of firepower left to compete in 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play. 

“With Blake and Eric gone, 
we lost two very good players,” 
Steidlmayer said. 
“They meant so 
much to the pro-
gram and will be 
missed. However, 
we have some 
young, eager play-
ers that want to 
lead the team and 
will do a good job 
with that.”

S t e i d l m a y e r 
had five Tritons 
play in the sin-
gles draw. Junior 
Vincent Nguyen will play a larger 
role this season as he fills in for 
the departed stars at the top of the 
ladder. His 2008-09 season debuted 
with a 6-3, 6-4 loss to Andrew 
Khuri-Yakub of Sonoma State. 
The match was closely contested 
throughout, with Khuri-Yakub 
earning only a single break of serve 
in each set to advance on to the 
next round. Nguyen went 11-8 in 
singles play last season, mostly at 
the No. 6 position where he went 
8-5.

Junior Brandon Stevenson had 
better luck in his first match of 
the season, defeating Jonathan 
Przybyl of Grand Canyon 6-4, 6-1. 
Stevenson’s aggressive play slowly 
wore down his opponent, espe-
cially in the second set where his 
game was working on all cylinders. 
Stevenson was a redshirt last year, 
but had the opportunity to practice 
with the team and has developed a 
great game from the baseline. 

“[Stevenson’s] got a strong 
desire to improve and has worked 
hard at it,” Steidlmayer said. “His 
forehand has really developed over 
the summer, and could become a 
big weapon.”

Sophomore Naveen Dixit also 

made his debut as a Triton, losing 
to James Lee of Cal Poly Pomona 
6-3, 6-2. Like Stevenson, Dixit was 
also a redshirt last year, but as a 
sophomore is certain to have a 
large impact on how UCSD per-
forms over the course of the year. 

“[Dixit’s] glaring weakness 
is experience,” Steidlmayer said. 
“[But] his consistency from behind 
the baseline allows him to attack 
with his forehand, and will allow 
him to succeed in pressure filled 
situations.”

Sophomore Erik Elliott and 
senior Kazumi Negishi earned first-
round byes in the tournament. They 
started play on the second day, and 
each won a match before falling in 
the next round. Elliott appeared in 
only two matches last season, but 
looked sharp in dispatching Luke 
Salazar of Western New Mexico 6-
2, 6-2 in his first match. In his next 
match, Elliott got off to another 
strong start, but couldn’t sustain 
his level, falling 4-6, 6-0, 6-3 to 
Joshua Lau of Cal Poly Pomona. 
In Negishi’s first match, the senior 
defeated Quan Vu of Sonoma State 
with a solid 6-4, 6-4 win. The next 
round provided a much stiffer 
opponent in Connor Olsen, also of 
Sonoma State. But Negishi couldn’t 
get his game together in that con-

test, losing 6-
2, 6-2.

For dou-
bles play, 
S t e i d l m a y e r 
put together 
two teams, 
one that had 
e x p e r i e n c e 
and the other 
a new pairing. 
One doubles 
team featured 
Nguyen and 
Dixit, who 

teamed to go 1-1 for the tour-
nament. In their first match, the 
duo defeated Jeremy Heckley and 
Khuri-Yakub of Sonoma State, but 
lost in the next round to a doubles 
team from Cal Poly Pomona, 8-5. 
Steidlmayer’s other doubles pairing 
consisted of Stevenson and Negishi, 
who had a solid showing. In their 
first match, the pair beat Lynch and 
Salazar of Western New Mexico 
8-4. Their run continued with 
another 8-4 win over a Western 
New Mexico team, Timosi Fa and 
Chris Toli. However, their dreams 
of earning a trip to nationals ended 
when they fell in the semifinals to 
the top-seeded team of Rong Ma 
and Agnel Peter of BYU-Hawaii 
8-0.

With no one advancing to the 
ITA National Championships in 
Alabama, the Tritons can now turn 
their attention toward their first 
team match on Oct.17 when they 
host Cerritos College. That match 
will precede the annual Alumni 
Tournament, a lighthearted event 
featuring former players on Oct.18 
at North Courts.
