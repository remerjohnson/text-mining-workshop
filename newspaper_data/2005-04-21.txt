Students protest fees, budget 
Students meet with governor's official 

By PATRICK ALLEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Hundreds of students from 
an Diego colleges and univer i-

ties, joined by middle and high 
school students, gathered at an 
Diego City ollege and marched 
to ,ov. rnold Schwarzenegger's 
San Diego District Office as part 
of a ,tatewide day of pro te t on 
April 20. 

Rall ying against ri sing costS of 
education and Schwarzenegger 's 
proposed budget, approximately 
70 UCSD students joined the 
crowd along with those from 
San Diego State University, San 
Diego City College, Cal tate San 
Marco and various other city and 
community colleges that marched 
through downtown streets. 

"We are at the governor's 
office to let him know that you 
cannot continue to tax students," 
A.S. Vice President External Rigo 
Marquez said . "Any way you put 
it, raisi ng our fees equals taxa-
tion ," 

According to Elea nor Roosevelt 
College sophomore Anh To, the 
protest was nece sary becau e it is 
students who bring about change.

Fee rally: Students from state-funded San Diego public schools marched from San 
Diego City College to the governor's distnct office to protest expected tuition increases. 

"[The protest] might not lead 
to results, but as a student, I have 
to do what r can," To said . "At a 
minimum, l want recognition from 
the school that there is a problem 
with student fees. At most, I hope 
that they do not raise fees." 

SDSU Associated Students 
Vice President External J arad 

anchez said that thc rally was 
meant to put pressure on the 

Legislature to fund Proposition 
QR, which would pr,ovide more 
state money for public school and 
the community. 

"We have a number of things 
happening," Sanchez said . "We 
are doing joint lobby visits, writ-
ing letters to legislators, and 
organizing other campus event

Bill would allow use 
of race in admissions 

Similar effort vetoed last year 
by Gov. Schwarzenegger 
By CHARLES NGUYEN 

Staff Writer 

A.S. senators approved a resolu-
tion in support of a bill written by 
Assembly Speaker Fabian uiiez 
(D-Sacramcnto) that would autho-
rize the University of California and 
California State University systems 
to consider fac tors such as ethnicity 
and gender in admissions. 

The llllnamed bill, known 
as AB 1452, is movi ng through 
the California Legislature. On 
April 5, the Higher Educa tion 
Subcommittee passed the bill by a 
vote of 5- 1. The bill is now being 
reviewed by the appropriati ons 
COllUllittee, according to Nunez's 
spokesman, Alex Tra~erso . 

The lcg islation would allow 
the UC and C U systems to con-
sider culture, race, gender, eth-
nicity, national origin, geographic 
origin and household income in 
admissions processes, so long as 
no preference is given. Preference 
based on race is prohibited under 

Propo irion 209, passed in 1996. 
If :lpproved by th e L~gi,laturc 

and signed by the governor, the bill 
wou ld work in conjunction with 
Proposition 209 rather than ovc r-
ride it, according to ' l i-avcr~o. 

"The bill h:1; no impact on 209," 
hc sa id . " It's more of a tool to give 
to the CS and UC S\,StC I11S that 
they can u e to be :1wa~c if lhc{rc 
not reaching a certain group of ~1lI­
dents or if they nced to outreach to 
a certain community." 

Revell Collegc Scnior cnator 
Ted McComb drafted a resolu ti on 
in support of J uiiez's proposal; the 
resolution was passed 14-6-4 by :1 
roll-call vote April 15. A1cComb,

University admitted fewer 
lower .... scoring students 

Ludacris to perform at Sun God 
No changes made to admission 

process, administrators say 
By NAVELI PAGAZA 

Contri buting Writer 

The University of California has 
aid that it made no changes to its 

admissions procedures that would 
explain why it accepted fewer stu-
dents with low SAT scores last year 
than in 2003. Last year, the univer-
sity came under criticism from one 
of its own regents, who argued that 
administrators were accepting too 
many unqualified sn1dents. 

An analysis by the Los Angeles 
Times released earlier this month 
- before the most recent admis-
sion numbers for next fa ll were 
available - showed that UC cam-
puses admitted 2,200 fewer appli-

cants with scores of 1000 or below 
in 2004 than in 2003, a drop of 26.6 
percent. 

However, UC Office of the 
President spokeswoman Ravi 
Poorsina denied tha t the univer-
sity has changed its criteria, aying 
"external factors fluctuate the out-
comes of how the fres hman class 
wi ll look from year to year." 

Assista n t Vice Chance ll or 
of Admissions and Enroll ment 
Services Mae W. Brown said there 
are significant reasons to explain 
the discrepancy in admission statis-
tics from 2003 to 2004.

Programming commissioner praises 'diversity' 
By IAN S. PORT 
Sen ior Staff Writer 

Ludacris, the Wa lkmen, 
Phantom Planet and D amien 
Marley wi ll be among the art-
ists performing at this year's Sun 
God festival, A.S. Commissioner 
of Programming Rishi Shah 
announced earlier this week. 

The confirmation came after 
weeks of speculation by students 
and campus media outlets, fue led 
largely by preannouncement post-
ings on ba nd Web sites. 

The fu ll lineup for the 23rd 
annual festiva l wi ll include, on the 
main stage, Ludacris, Phantom 
Planet, and Damien Marley and 
tile Empire. On the side stage, 
the Walkrnen, Rufio and a yet-
to-be-named "special guest" will 
perform. 

New this year is the addition 
of up-and-coming national bands 
Gatsby's American Dream and 
Over It to the daytime stage in 
Price Center, complementing the 
group of local and student bands 
that usually perform there. 

''I'm really stoked about the 
lineup," A.S. Commissioner of 
Programming-elect Eric Morris 
said. "We have a real diversity of 
bands this year, which we haven't 
had before. We haven 't had a reg-
gae act like Damien Marley in a 
long time, if ever." 

The remaining "special act" 

will also contribute to the variety, 
according to Morris. 

"We've got one more act com-
ing that, if we confirm, will add 
even more di versity to the lineup," 
he said. 

As is customary, the un God 
performers were the subjec t of 
hot speculation among students. 
Adding to the rumors this yea r 
were postings on the Web sitcs of 
the Walkrncn and Marley, how-
ing UC D's RIMAC Field as a 
May 13 tour stop. 

Morris said he is thrilled to 
have a currently popul ar act like 
Ludacris performing. 

"Luda is huge," he said . "We 
get flak sometimes for picking art-
ists that, even though they may 
have been really big, maybe aren't 
so much anymore. Wc're really 
happy this time to get someone at 
the apcx of their career." 

The Atlanta hip-hopper def-
initely still is, according to his 
recent sales. His last two albums, 
Chiekm -N- 8w' and The Red Ligbr 
Dim"iet, both reached number one 
on the Billboard Top 200 and Top 
R&B/Hip-Hop lists and fostercd 
a string of hit si ngles including 
"Stand Up." 

The rapper has also acted in 
numerous film , including the 2005 
rap movie "Hustle and Flow," and 
2003's "2 Fast 2 Furious."

Race: Law would violate 
Proposition 209, group warns 

continued {rom page I 
stated in an e-mail. "By loolcing at 
the whole picture, we're getting 
a better sense of how well these 
students really are performing, 
given their context, and at the 
same time we're brealcing down 
the ultimately discriminatory 
selection mechanisms that keep 
underrepresented groups out of 
the UCs." 

A portion of AB 1452 would 
require the UC system to report 
student-body statistics to the 
California legislature every two 
years, Traverso said. If signifi-
cant differences between stu-
dent groups are reported, the 
law would either givt! lawmakers 
the chance to address problems 
themselves or allow UC and CSU 
admi nistrators to remedy the situ-
ation, he said. 

"It helps keep the UC and 
CSU systems accountable," 
Traverso said. 

Opponents, however, are skep-
tical of the bill's legality. 

"This isn't a question of diver-
sity," said Craig DeLuz., spokes-
man for Assemblyman Tim Leslie 
(R-Sacramenro), [he only Higher 
Education Subcommittee mem-
ber to vote against the proposal. 
"What this bill wants to achi eve 
is completely illegal because of 
Proposition 209. There is no way 
you can have consideration of 
factors such as ethnicity wi thout 
havi ng preference." 

In a legal opinion on the pro-
posed legislation, Pacific Legal 
Foundation attorney Sharon 
Browne said the "no preference" 
proviso was a "meaningless dis-
claimer to protect the bill from a 
legal challenge under Proposition 
209." 

"It does nothing to counter 
the express encouragement to 
use and consider race and gen-
der in admissions decisions," 
Browne stated in an email. "It is 

our legal opinion that it violates 
Proposition 209." 

Browne has worked for PLF, a 
conserva tive-Ieaning group, as an 
enforcer of Proposition 209. 

However, Traverso said that 
AB 1452 does not allow student 
affirmative action. 

"We have been extremely 
careful to alleviate everyone's 
concerns about the bill superced-
ing Proposition 209," he said. 
"AB 1452 is a way to ensure that 
each of these groups of students 
is given an equal opportunity by 
having CSU and UC look at their 
own numbers. Nowhere in the 
bill does it mention things like 
racial or gender quotas." 

UC administrators have 
taken no position on the bill, 
according to UC Office of the 
President spokeswoman Ravi 
Poorsina. 

"Our lawyers have advised that 
[it] would not provide additional 
flexibility in the admissions pro-
cess due to the constraints we 
face under Proposition 209," she 
stated in an e-mail. "The bill will 
not affect UC admissions policies 
or procedures." 

A similar bill was proposed 
last year by Assemblyman 
Ma rco Firebaugh (D-South 
Gate) but was vetoed by Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger. While 
Traverso admitted the current 
proposal is almost identical to 
Firebaugh's failed bill , he said 
Nunez is hopeful of his propos-
al's chances. 

"Since last year, there has been 
legislative council opinion that 
a bill such as this wouldn't put 
any weight on preferential treat-
ment," Traverso said. "Some of 
the governor's concerns with the 
last bill have been addressed since 
then."

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
A.S. Meeting '28 - April 20 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
Items C-E 

John Muir College Junior 
Senator Neil Spears, Commissioner 
of Student Advocacy Denis 
Shmidt and A.S. Student Assistant 
Di Lam were appointed to the 
Compensation Review Board, 
which will make recommendations 
on the size of council stipends for 
the upcoming cOWlcil. 

According to Spears, the board 
will recommend the termination 
of senator stipends, an $80 per 
year stipend for executive mem-
bers and commissioners, and $10 
and $ 15 per week for the senate 
chair and vice-chair, respectively. 

Item F 
The council unanimously 

passed a resolution calling on the 
administration to halt the process 
of naming Sixth College after for-
mer UCSD Chancellor and UC 
President Richard C. Atkinson. 

According to the resolu-
tion, the Sixth College Executive 
Committee did not elicit student 
opinions and misinformed the only 
student on the committee about 
the meeting time for the vote. The 
resolution also said that the name 
of the college should reflect Sixth 
College's dedication to the promo-
tion of culture, art and technology. 

Reports 
Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Denis Shmidt 

Shrnidt reported that his office 

is accepting applications for stu-
dents seelcing to become the next 
commissioner of student advocacy. 

Council Caucus 
Commissioner of Student 

Services Kian Maleki told the 
council that the A.S . Safe Rides 
program is discussing placing a 
limit on the number of times 
a student can use the service. 
According to Maleki, students 
would be given one ride per quar-
ter in order to reduce the costs 
of the program. Students would 
be able to earn more rides by 
attending educational seminars 
throughout the year. 

Members of the council opposed 
the limitations, however, saying 
that students should have access to 
A.S. Safe Rides in order to reduce 
the number of drunk drivers on the 
road and assist students who are in 
difficult situations. Some cOWlcil-
members suggested that students 
who overuse the service be charged 
money in order to ride. 

Old Business 
Item} 

The council indefinitely post-
poned an amendment to its sen-
ate bylaws that enumerate spe-
ci fie reasons for which the senate 
meeting can be closed. Warren 
College Junior Senator Josh 
Martino said that the legislation 
was postponed to allow the coun-
cil to discuss raising the neces-
sary vote to close meetings from 
a two-thirds majority to three-
fourths of the senators.

Langley to leave for 

Georgetown job 
Vice Chancellor of External 

Relations James M. Langley has 
announced his intention to leave at 
the end of t~e academic year to take 
over as vice president for alumni and 
university relations at Georgetown 
University. 

"Although his commitment to 
UCSD remains steadfas~ this is an 
opportunity that rarely comes along.' 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox stated 
in a campuswide e-mail announcing 

Lan~ey's resignation. 
As vice chancellor, Lan~ey has 

helped the campus double Its annu-
al total of private donations and has 
led the university's "Imagine 'M1at's 
Next" campaign (or $1 binion in gifts 
- an effort that is two-thirds of the 
way complete. More recently, LanRiey 
also spearheaded the campus' fai'led 
efforts to raise private money to pay for 
the rebuilding Df University House, the 
official residence of the chancellor. 

'Although I have only worked with 
him for the last nine months, I imme-
diately knew the impact he had made 
on UCSD upon meeting him: Fox 
stated. "His tireless efforts and advo-
caCf on extemal relations have built 
the solid foundation that we will use 
to move forward in implementing our 
vision for UCSD~ 

Langley's replacement has not yet 
been announced. 

State committee 
passes video game bill 

Backed by a coalition of Girl 
Scouts, parents, psychiatrists and legal 
experts, the state Assembly's Judiciary 
Committee unanimously voted to 
approve a bill that would restrict the 
sale of "ultra-violent" video games to 
children. 

"The Judiciary Committee spoke 
loud and clear today that this bill 
is not only the right thing to do to 
protect our children, but it is consti-
tutional as well," Speaker Pro-Tem 
Leland Vee CD-San Francisco/Daly 
City) stated in a press release. 

Vee sponsored the legislation. 
The bipartisan B{) vote will mean 

that the measure will likely move on 
to another committee before fac-
ing the full Assembly. The legislation 
would prohibit the sale and rental 
of video ~ames that show injuries to 
humans In a manner that is esr;-
cially heinous, atrocious or cruel. It 
would apply to customers 16 years of 
age or you nger. 

Under the pian, violators would 
face a fine of up to S 1 ,000. 

The entertainment industry spent 
significant amounts on lobbying 

efforts in an attempt to defeat the bill, 
according to Vee. 

Students optimistic 
about finances 

College upperclassmen are more 
optimistic about next yea(s economy 
than older adults, and have a bet-
ter financial outlook than they did 
last year, a second annual survey by 
financial literaCf program City Credit-
ED has. shown. 

In the poll, juniors and seniors said 
they were confident about achieving 
early financial independence, though 
they expected salaries no higher than 
those surveyed last year, 

The data also showed that stu-
dents said they were more likely to 
spend their post~raduation disposable 
income on "Instant gratification buys" 
instead of planning for their retirement 

Overall, 42 percent of upperclass-
men said they planned to live a com-
fortable lifestyle with little or no debt 
as early as three years after gradua-
tion. This number was seven percent 
higher than a year ago. 

In addition, only 22 percent said 
they would save or invest money left 
over after expenses, down by almost 
a third from last year. 

Nobel laureate to 
deliver physics ledure 

UC Santa Barbara physics professor 
David Gross, who received the 2004 
Nobel Prize for his work on explain-
ing how the nuclei of atoms work, 
will deliver this year's annual physics 
department lecture. Scheduled for 4 
p.m. on AVril 21 in the medical school's 
Basic Science Buading. the event is free 
and open to the public. 

The annual talk is organized to 
honor the memory of Norman Kroll, 
a pioneer in quantum physics and 
founding member of the campus' 
physics aepartment 

In 1973, Gross solved the remain-
ing problems in what is known as 
the "Standard Model" of quantum 
mechanical picture Df reality. 

Students support 
savings accounts 

Almost 70 percent of college stu-
dents said they were concemed that 
Social Security would not pay them 
benefits when they retire, and more 
than half said they would favor private 
savings accounts, accordin~ to a sur-
vey from Harvard University's Institute 
of Politics. 

In the poll, Social Secury ranked 
second after war as students primary 
issue of concem.

'UC admits all eligible freshmen 
Number jumps 11 percent to hit record 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
News Editor 

A year after it told more than 
8,000 freshman applican ts they 
had to attend a communiry col-
lege instead, the Universiry of 
California announced this week 
that it has found a place for every 
qualified applicant at a UC campus 
for next faJl. 

Overall, total admission of 
California residents at the uni ver-
siry jumped almost II percent from 
las t year, totaling a record-breaking 
50,017 . 

"We are very pleased," UC 
Director of Undergraduate 
Ad missions Susan A. Wilbur said. 
"The universiry i very proud of its 
historic commitment to accommo-
date all UC-qualified students." 

At UC 0, administrato rs 
offered admission to 17.787 new 
freshmen for the first two quarters 
of next year, up 3.7 percent from 
last spring. The figure included 
a number of students who were 
also offered admission to other UC 
campuses. 

The numbers mean that UCSD 
has offered more than two our of 
every five applicants a spot at the 
campus in the fall, up sli ghtly from 
a year ago. By comparison, both 
UC Berkeley and UCLA admitted 
just 27.7 percent of appli cants, the 
most competitive ratio in the uni-
versiry system. 

Growth for underrepresented 
snldents - made up of minoriry 
ethnic groups - also exceeded the 
rise in general population num-
bers, after dropping last year. Only 
Mexican-Americans posted a yea r-
to-year decline. 

In addition, biology, chemistry 

and bioengineering represented 
the top major picks by new admits 
at UCSD, respectively. Political 
science and economics rounded off 
the top five most popular majors. 

Systemwid~, however, Wilbur 
said the un.iversity saw few unex-
pected trends in the numbers th is 
year. 

"This year appears to be a year 
of good stabili ry for us, and there 
appear to be no surprises ," she said, 
explaining that the universiry was 
pleased that it was able to offer a 
seat to every eligible student. 

Most demographi c data 
remained _ largely unchanged , 
though average high school grades 
and SAT scores of admitted Stu-
dents dropped slightly. At UCSD, 
the average GPA remained flat at 
4.05 and the SAT scores were rel-
at ively uncha ngecl , at about 1300. 

"We are very pleased with the 
qualiry of the class - the academic 
profile is very impressive," Assistant 
Vice Chancellor of Admissions 
and Enrollment Services Mae W. 
Brown said. 

Though the campus is stil l 
working on finalizing the data for 
transfer srudents, Brown said she 
was also happy with the nllmbers. 

Statewide, Northern Californ ia 
and the San Francisco Bay Area 
posted the largest proportional 
annual increa es in new admits 
across the universiry, Wilbur said. 
More than four out of every five 
Bay Area applicants were offered a 
spot at some UC campus, the data 
showed. 

According to Wilbur, UC 
Merced's sched uled opening next 
year also helped this year's record 
rate' of admission. To fill its 1,000 
spots, the campus offered admis-

sion to nearly 6,000 freshman stu-
dents. 

Like other UC campuses, 
Merced's ad mission numbers 
exceed the total number of new 
students because many applicants 
often choose to attend a different 
campus or universiry. 

Much of this yea r's growth 
represents a correction from last 
year's "anomaly," Wilbur said. At 
the time, the governor's budget 
proposal forced the university to 
initially deny admission to eligible 
students for the first time in more 
than three decades. 

Compared to 2003, the last 
"normal" year, this year's numbers 
showed only slight growth . 

The uni versity credited its 
funding compact with Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, signed last year, 
for the returned ability to find 
a seat for all qualified students. 
T hough the state Legislature will 
not ratify a fi nal budget for next 
year until the summer, UC Office 
of the President spokeswoman 
Ravi Poorsina said the univer-
sity was confident that lawmakers 
would adopt the numbers in the 
compact. 

"We are definitely confident 
about the compact and we have 
faith that the governor will follow 
through on it," she said. "We hope 
he will pull through with it." 

T he most recent data, released 
by UCOP, excludes admission 
information for out-of-state and 
international students. 

At UCSD, numbers in the two 
ca tegori es posted increa cs over 
both 2003 and 2004.

Fox must share the 
pain, end house ordeal 
W hen they raised stu-dent fees in each of the last four years, 
the regents told us we had 
to adapt to a lean state bud-
get, like everyone else. The 
University of California 
has said the same thing to 
its service workers, despite 
studies showing that they are 
grossly underpaid. 

Even UC President 
Robert C. Dynes has done 
his part, taking a pay cut, 
compared to the sa lary of his 
predecessor. 

Yet while administrators 
have asked students and 
employees to share the pain 
of state cuts, they have not 
asked the same of Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox. In fact, to 
comply with the provisions 
in her contract, the univer-
sity has scrambled to raise 
$7 .2 million to build Fex a 
house and has been paying 
her monthly rent of $6,500. 

In every letter and every 
public event, our chancel-
lor loves to praise this great 

university, calling it one of 
the best in the world and 
extolling her empathy for 
students and employees. 

But while these same stu-
dents and same employees 
continue to bear the pain 
of state budget, Fox has 
not offered to unilaterally 
change her contract by drop-
ping the housing provision. 
Nor has she even offered to 
extend the four-mile radius 
within which the university 
must house her so as to give 
administrators extra flexibil-
ity. 

This page has long sup-
ported moderation and 
understanding in the univer-
sity'S response to fiscal real-
ity. But this position should 
extend to everyone involved, 
whether they're covered by a 
bureacratic contract or pro-
cedural safeguards. 

Chancellor Fox: If you 
are as happy and fortunate 
to be here as you always tell 
us, you must .share the pain 
with the rest of us. 

U,House fund,raising 
project a waste of time 
Plans to rebuild the bloat-ed University House have been scrapped. 
Good riddance. The uruver-
si ty has much more I2ress-
ing problems than budding 
a $7 .2 million roof over 
the head of a lavishly paid 
chancellor. It's a shame that 
the university spent untold 
amounts of time and effort 
pursull1g th is ul timately 
doomed fund-raising drive 
instead of securing funding 
for projects that WIll benefit 
the university as a whole, not 
just a few fa t cats. 

Not only will the univer-
sity now have to give back a 
pointedly undisclosed sum 
of money to the donors 
willing to support the 
University House project, 
but the time and effort now 
outgoing Vice Chancellor 
of External Relations James 
M . Langley spent trying to 
ralse the $7.2 million is for 

naught. While the univer-
sity languishes and students 
struggle under the weig-ht 
of l:iudget cuts and riSing 
tuition, Langley spent six 
months working on behalf 
of already privi leged elites. 

His time would have been 
better spent raising money 
that would better the uni-
versity. 

In fact, administrators 
willingly admitted that com-
peting fund-raising priori-
ties nurt their attempts to 
raise the money. Surely, 
log-ic would follow, that 
thiS particular fund-raisin~ 
project hurt the university s 
att~mpts to find upport for 
truly necessary programs. 

While the university cites 
budget cuts for all its short-
comings and mercilessly 
squeezes students, diverting 
time and resources to serv-
ing university elites is unfair 
and unwise.

Lack of guilt over illegal file,sharing 
ensures the failure of RIAA lawsuits 
By ROBIN AVERBECK Ind 

MARIANNE MADDEN 
Staff Writers 

Even with the specter of 
Recording Industry Association 
of America lawsuits looming over 
their glowing computer screens, 
illegal file-sharers continue to 
ope rate gleefully and generally 
free of guilt. Our generation is the 
first to be reared on the Internet, 
and we operate according to a 
double standard and a question-
able ethical code: Shoplifting CDs 
from a store is abhorrent; down-
loading the same albums for free 
on i2hub is a fun afternoon . Why, 
when all other social norms of 
"do not steal" are understood and 
observed, does this maxim fly out 
the window when we get in front 
of our computers? 

The technology of the Internet 
burst upon the scene when we were 
comi ng of age, lacking a guide-
book and spreading like wildfire 
while our identities and morals 
were sti ll developing. Without a 
road map or rules, parents had no 
idea hmv to handle this new tool. 
or even what it was. while our 
generation took to the technology 
like fish to water. Becoming com-
puter savvy is similar to learning 
a language: Those who start out 
at an early age seem to catch on 
more quickJy. Hence, the college 
students now being served sub-
poenas by the RIM were mere 
middle-schoolers when they first 
learned the magic of the Internet, 
and they learned it before their 
parents or any other authority fig-

ure dispensed the moral do's and 
don 'ts of cyberspace. 

So, we made up rules on our 
own - and we decided that down-
loading illegal copies of music 
and movies definitely does not 
count as an ethical trespass, or if 
it does, it is a minor one that is 
made less severe by the perceIved 
transgressions of the music indus-
try: inflated CD prices, homo-
geneous and subpar offerings, 
and so forth. Unforrunately, the 
RIM - spurred by its own moral 
codes, or merely the bottom line 
- vehemently disagrees. 

Many of us expect the music 
industry to adapt to our addiction 
to free music. or we revel in the 
idea of spoiled pop stars getting 
ripped off. At the very Icast, we 
operate blissfully unaware of the 
possible consequences of denying 
the music industry our dollars. 
A UCSD student the Guardian 
interviewed. likely facing an RIM 
lawsuit, said the lawsuit has made 
him stop downloading music. but 
he "didn't really feel bad" when 
he did it. 

"If I was downloading music 
from J ay-Z and I saw he was hav-
ing a rough year then I'd feel bad, 
but most of the artists I download 
I don't see doing badly." the stu-
dent said. 

Another student currently 
assigned to an lP address listed 
in the recent lawsuit told us, "I'm 
getting in trouble for having a 
Janet Jackson song and Usher. 
U her is walking around with my 
college tui tion on his wrist!" 

Clearly, the Illusic industry has 

yet to convince this generation that 
downloading music is significantly 
harming the profits of individual 
artists. How, in a world where VH I 
and MTV lineups are stacked full 
of shows documenting the excesses 
of celebrity lifestyles - with an 
cmphasi:. on female pop starlets. 
hip-hop artists and their entou-
rages. all laden with bling bling 
- could we ever buy the argument 
that snldents are forcing musical 
artists out of house and home? 
Another UCSD ex-downloader 
expecting prosecution described 
herself as "scared shitless" about 
the lawsuit. but described the music 
lawsuits as "a lost cause that they're 
stressing too much over. ". r feel 
like people are sti ll going to buy 
CDs .... There's nu way the music 
industry is going to go kaput." 

She speaks for a generation of 
American college students, and 
ahecdotal evidence supports tile 
assertion that downloading may 
be taking a small slice Ollt of 
CD purchases, but not obliterat-
ing them. Whatever the economic 
reality, the RIM is perceived as a 
greedy bully, not as a legitimate 
victi m of stea ling. 

The RlAA started a suing spree 
two years ago that has continued 
with settlement after settlement 
- leading many to conclude that 
the RlM is draining downloaders' 
pockets and lining their own to 
compensate for a small loss from 
illegal file-sharing. 

Although the average suit from 
the RIM is settled out of court for

Ba.nkruptcy: better than servitude 
lines in 
the sand 

Ian S. Port 

I was 9 years old, and the phone in our hou e had a weird problem: It kept ring-
ing with calls from people I didn't 
know. They'd ask for "Mom or 
Dad" in a stern voice. And when 
I told them Mom and Dad weren't 
home (as was usually the case), 
the voices would leave omi nous 
messages: "This is so-and-so from 
Macy's (or Visa or MasterCard or 
Discover or San Ramon Bank). 
We're calli ng about the overdue 
invoice from May (or April or 
March or ovember) . Please send 
payment as soon as possible." 

I could always sense irri tation 
when I took their message, as if 
they thought I was the reason 
their money never showed up. 

I wasn't. Like many American 
divorces, my parents came with 
the added bonus of severe financial 
hardship. At the time, I didn't get 
why we had to drop off my dad's 
new car at some random parking 
lot in Martinez with the keys inside. 
I didn't understand why we had to 
move out of our house and into a 
different one farther from where 
I went to school. Or why, even 
after the bank repossessed a car and 
a home, the "creditors" - what 
my parents called those angry tele-
phone voices - didn't stop calling. 

What I did get was that their 
calls were not as important as 
they sounded. What was impor-
tant then was whether or not one 
of my parents would stick around 
long enough to cook dinner - or 
even talk, for that matter. Usually 
their "talking" started out OK. 

but more and more often it would 
devolve into fights that would 
last for hours. with both of them 
screaming at each other from dif-
ferent sides of the living room 
in the same malicious tone. And 
when they would see a note that 
one of the "creditors" called, the 
screaming only got louder, until 
one of them would shut them-
selves up in their room (they slept 
in separate rooms after we moved). 
Then the talk was over, and soon 
after, one of them would leave. 

Our family's downward spiral 
ended in two drastic legal measures: 
divorce and bankruptcy. When 
you're pulling coi ns out of the sofa 
to buy groceries and not talking to 
your spouse except to lacerate him 
or her with more blame and/or 
hurt - when there ain't no way 
things are getting better on their 
own - all you can do is wipe the 
slate clean and move on. 

But this week President George 
W . Bush signed off on a piece of 
legislation that makes it harder 
for families to do just that. The 
Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and 
Consumer Protection Act of 2005 
makes it so that even after filing 
for bankruptcy. many debtors will 
have to devise a way to pay back 
some of those angry telephone 
voices. 

The credit industry (and the 
Republican legisla tive majority 
that passed the bill) claim that it 
will put a stop to "abusive" bank-
ruptcy filings, which they say have 
been escalating. Too many people 
living the high life, and forcing 
others to pay for it, they say. The 
new laws will make credit cheaper 
for everyone. they say. 

Uh huh. 
Filing for bankruptcy. by tile 

way, makes the next 10 years of life 
for the filer absolute hell. Being 
poor sucks now. but try living 

in the real world wi th the worst 
credit rating pOSSible. You can't 
get a credit card (so you can't buy 
anything online or by mail-order, 
buy a plane ticket or ren t a car). 
You can't get a loan, so good 
luck buying a house or a car. In 
a consumption-driven world, you 
might as well have your hands tied 
behind your back. 

A recent Harvard study found 
that half of all U .S. bankruptcies 
are re lated to illness or medi-
cal bills. I bet the other half are 
related to divorce. 

Or they are from people who 
got tricked into acquiring a huge 
amount of credit debt - lord 
knows it's hard wi th all these cred-
it card applications clogging our 
mailboxes every day - and even-
rually can't pay anymore. 

But in any of these circum-
stances. what occurs that entitles 
the debtor to be stripped of his or 
her right to a clean slate? In a soci-
ety that depends on its members 
buying commodities with terminal 
voracity. don 't we at least owe our 
fellow consumer the chance to 
start over, with no grudge? 

That if how it's been since 1898 
- but this is a new era of American 
politics, where The Good Ideas 
We Had are meaningless . Where 
the explanation for each increas-
ingly inexplicable action by the 
body that claims to be our gov-
ernment lies in the intricacies of 
special-interest lobbying. 

In other words. follow the 
money, and you'll find yourself 
looking at a group of interests 
- Credit, Retail, Evil - that've 
been clamoring for the first major 
banlcruptcy change in 27 years. 
That don't seem to care that their 
advertising trickery and dauntless 
persistence have created an over-

Complaints about ERC 
J-8oard not justified 

Dear Editor: 
After reading the articles about 

the elections at Eleanor Roosevelt 
College, it is necessary to defend 
what went on. as a member of 
Srudent Council at ERC and the 
Judicial Board chair and as an ERC 
student. I find it surprising and 
unfoTnmate that students at this uni-
versity behave so childishly about 
these matters. and. in this situation, 
find it flat-out offensive consider-
ing we went through the correct 
process. per both our elections and 
Judicial Board bylaws. 

The hearing was open to all 
members of the public and closed 
to members of the press, as request-
ed by vice chair candidate Roger 
Chin . Who showed up to the hear-
ings was beyond my control but 
it was not just members of Onka 
present at the hearing. Ignorance 
is no excuse for negligence. My job 
as Judicial Board chair is to provide 
students with a fair trial, providing 
them the means necessary to thei r 
rights, which I ensured. Because 
I am not a voting member on 
the Judicial Board and all the vot-
ing members are not members of 
SCERC, the so-called SCERC bias 
cannot have existed . 

Further, if the Judicial Board is 
biased, then how was the Dynamite 
slate previously granted the right 
to rei nstate former ERC at-large 
representative Michael Stockin after 
the Elections Conunittee deemed 
him ineligible to participate in the 
election in a hearing prior to the 
one concerning the disqualification? 
Also, the Judicial Board granted the 
Dynamite slate a temporary restrain-
ing order, which allowed it to keep 
its campaign material lip and leave

and fully deliberated and made our 
decision. I find the articles published 
to be hypocritical and one-sided -
not to mention inaccurate - so I am 
not trying to arrack eitller "side"; but 
no one is a winner in this matter. 

The Judicial Board does not take 
side; it imply interprets ERC's 
bylaws in light of the facts presented . 
What is discussed in the delibera-
tion among Judicial Board members 
is not made public to protect the 
students involved, and it is not the 
obligation of the Judicial Board to 
make public anything more than the 
votes based on the facts. It is not the 
responsibility of the Judicial Board 
to decide why or how something is 
the way it is but rather to make a 
decision based on the information 
offered and the pre-existing bylaws, 
which is exactly what was done and 
will continue to be done.

RIAA: Illegal 
file .. sharing 
not seen as 

taboo 
continued from page 4 

$3,000 or so, the fines can rWl in to 
the hundreds of thousands, and such 
financial consequences contribute to 
the ethos of downloading as rebel-
lion agai nst corporate America. Yet 
such a justification provides little 
comfort when the fat cats come 
knocking on your door - exactly 
the simarion faced by the 25 UCSD 
students being hwned by the RlAA 
after using i2 hub. Yet guilt and 
remorse are no t all several of these 
students say they are fee ling as tlley 
await court documents. In tead, they 
feel victimized and unfairl y targeted, 
but resigned to their fates. 

One ta rget for a subpoena said, 
"1 don't think ]facing a lawsuit] is 
fair at all. It's kind of sad that I'd like 
to see more people get punished for 
it. It's such a small num ber. Onl y 25 
students - come onl T hat 's not even 
an elementary school classroom ... . 
It's like you have three murderers 
and you only convict one. " 

Clearly, the die has been cast. 
Whatever condi tions that wou ld 
have created a sense of ethi cal 
bo undaries on the Internet com-
muni ty have been lost, and it's too 
late to create them. Or maybe our 
scruples are simply superseded by 
the ease of do wnloading music, even 
when facing a slim chance of being 
caught and payi ng a heavy price. 

What's cermin is that this gen-
eration of prosecuted file-sharers 
- and th e droves of unprosecuted 
ones hiding in the shadows - sp,lre 
no sympathy for musical artists and 
espeCially the RlAA. While it seems 
mo t students targeted for lawsuits 
at UC D will stop sharing fi les 
online and warn their friends to 
do the same, it sti ll remai ns to be 
seen whether RIAA lawsuits, or even 
more extreme mea ures, will wipe 
out file-sharing altogether. If his-
tory holds, several new peer-to-peer 
networks will spring up to replace 
any that are eradicated, bo lstcred 
by hordes of downloaders fueled by 
the convenience of file-shari ng and 
bi tterness toward the music industry 
and the tactics used by the RIAA.

to ensure tha t people are a ware of 
what is goi ng on." 

During the protest that took 
place in the street, student lead-
ers from each campus met with 
San Diego Field Office Director 
Cameron Durckel. After the meet-
ing, Campus Organizing Director 
and Vice President External-elect 
Kevin Mann said that the meeting 
with Durckel was unusual. 

"We heard some 

" 

cap on the rate that student fees 
ca n increase. 

Many students, however, said 
that they are not comforted by the 
cap. Marquez said that he attended 
a community college for two years 
in order to lower the costs of edu-
cation, but that he will still have 
a large amount of debt when he 
graduates in July. 

"We will not stand for the 
increases," Marquez said . "Screw 

very interesting 
things," Mann said. 
"The fi rst thing we 
asked him was if the 
state believes that 
education is a right 
for all tud ents. 
They said they 
thought that edu-
cation was a right 
for [kindergarten 
through grade 12], 

We wiU not stand 
for the increases. 

the compact. I'm 
fed up that we have 
to miss class just to 
fight to make edu-
cation accessible." 

Despite student 
opposition to the 
fee increases out-
lined in the com-
pact, it is unlikely 
that the rally will 
lead to change, 

Screw the compact."

but not for higher education." 
Both Durckel and 

Schwarzenegger's press o ffi ces 
declined to comment, saying that it 
was a closed meeting, and referred 
all questions to th e Cali fornia 
Department of Finance. According 
to the Deputy Director of Exte rnal 
Affairs H.D. Pal mer, the governor 
has made a commitment to higher 
education. 

"The governor has made it very 
clear that higher education is an inte-
gral part of the state," Palmer said. 
"At a time when California has to 
close a budget gap of $9 billion, the 
governor's budget full y reflects the 
compact [between Schwarzenegger 
and state universities]." 

Palmer also said that the com-
pact calls for an increase of more 
than $76 million for basic budget 
support and $36 million for enroll-
ment growth, while also placing a 

according to UC 
Office of the President spokes-
woman Ravi Poorsina. 

"T he compact is what has saved 
us from having to cut enrollment," 
Poorsina said. "Both the governor 
and the UC president have com-
promised in a way that everyone 
would have to shoulder some of 
the responsibili ty. Unfortunatel y, the 
students are feeling the burden. T he 
bottom line is that we never like fee 
increases, but if you look at the state's 
fiscal situati on, we are very rel iant on 
the state for our funding." 

Marquez and Mann said that they 
wi ll continue to lobby against stu-
dent fee increases and for the protec-
tion of outreach funding. In addition, 
they said that they plan on another 
student campaign when the budget 
revisions are released in May.

SAT: Critics have questioned 
comprehensive review 

continued /rom fXIie I 
lic universities last year reduced in-
and out-of-state applicants," Brown 
said. "Also, international students 
faced increased costs in purchas-
ing student visas, which resulted in 
an admission drop throughout all 
groups of students." 

UCSD, for example, showed a 
five-percent overall drop last year 
in applicants as a result of fee hikes 
caused by state budget cuts during 
2004. 

To adjust to these challenges, UC 
campuses became more selective in 
admission procedures due to the 
limited number of spaces available. 

Another reason university offi-
cials admitted students with higher 
SAT scores last year was because 
students had a more competitive 
edge in 2004, with an average score 
of 1210 compared to 1197 in 2003, 
according to Poorsina. 

In 2004, 51 percent of appli-
cants with SAT scores of 1000 or 
below were accepted, as opposed 
to 63 percent the year before, the 
report showed. There was also a 
small -increase in acceptances for 
students scoring 1400 and above on 
the SAT exam. 

UC Regent John]. Moores 
released a report in late 2003 crit-
icizing UC Berkeley for admit-
ting nearly 400 students with SAT 
scores of 600 to 1000. 

Last March, in an article written 
for Forbes magazine, he accused 
the university of admitting low-
scoring students as a way to get 
around the sUte's ban on affirma-
tive action. 

Moores told the Times that he is 
happy that the UC system has taken 
a stand against admitting below-
average SAT scorers because, he 
said, tile university is "victimizing 
these kids by admitting them with 
low scores." 

Calls to Moores' consulting firm 
were not returned. 

Critics have charged that the 
2002 "comprehensive review" 
policy, which factors in students' 
hardships and awards extra consid-
eration to first-generation college 
applicants, is a way of admitting 
more minorities who do not score 
well on the SAT 

Brown denied that the universi-
ty favors underrepresented minori-
ties. 

She said campus administrators 
"follow the guidelines approved by 
the faculty" and that readers of 
applications can't determine appli-
cants' ethnicity, gender or national 
origin during selection. 

She also said that 77 percent of 
comprehensive review is based on 
academics, which "includes high 
school grades, honors classes and 
test scores, as well as community 
service." 

"We place greater weight on 
the four years students are in high 
school where they are taking diffi -
cult courses than we do on one test 
like the SAT," Brown said . 

The newspaper's analysis and 
the university's critics have focused 
only on criteria used for admis-
sions, Poor ina said. 

"The main point is that crit-
ics and studies revealed by the Los 
AngeltS 7imer look at SAT scores 
alone and seem to question our 
criteria, as though we are bring-
ing less-qualified students to the 
UC system," she said. "We must 
ulte into consideration that there 
will be fluctuations 1T0m year to 
year where, for example, there will 
sometimes be more highly quali -
fied students - but we have never 
deliberately changed our criteria."

THURSDAY. APRIL 21. 200S THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATU 9 

Translating dirty diplomacl into 
matters of hfe and death 

Pollock thriller 'The Interpreter' gives a whole 
new meaning to international politics 

By JAKE NARE 
Staff Writer 

For a movie that never gives the viewer one moment to s top and think, "The Interpreter" lays down a fairly dense 
plot that demands the audience's attention . 
Dozi ng off for a seco nd could spell the 
end of understanding who's who o r what's 
what. Evidence and bodies turn up too fast 
for even the 1lI0st attentive filmgoer to fo l-
low, but don't think 100 hard ; like Illany 
thri ll ers, you have to take what the writers 
give you and not question it. Despite a plot 
that leaves some questions lingering, this 
fi lm never bores. 

Nicole Kidman - looki ng surprising-
ly good for a change - stars as Silvia 
Broome, a very private and unremarkable 
United Nations interpreter who inadver-
tently overhears a death threat against an 
African head of state who is scheduled to 
address the UN. In the first of a number 
of credibi lity-chall enging coincidences, the 
threat is spoken in a rare language that few 
can understand - but she can. Silvia has a 
lot invested in these African relations; she 
herself is African-born, being from the fic-
tional state of Matoba, where genocide and 
revolution occur every day. 

Director Sydney Pollock gives Silvia 
pl enty of time to state her world view. She 
may only be an interpreter, but she under-
stands that a mistake in translation can 
have global consequences. She also voices 
her preference for diplomacy over violence, 
a view she shares with her employer, the 
United Nations. The writers may be using 
this action film to make a politica l state-
ment, but thankfully it's all in the subtext. 
Politics too often interfere with entertain-
ment - and this movi e is all about enter-
tainment. 

Film 
REVIEW 

Much of the tilm 's excitement comes 
from th e interactio n between Kidman' 
character and Sean Penn, a federal agent 
charged with protecting Silvia. either 
Silvia nor Tobin trusts the other; Tobin is 
never quite sure if Silvia is telling him the 
truth, or even if she herself is in volved in 
the assassi nation plot. 

The characters are set up to mirror 
each other - he's trampled by personal 
demons, while she' doi ng everything she 
can to protect the secrets of her pa t. T his 
re lationship allows fo r a quasi- romance, 
which could have easily taken thi s movie 
down, had the writer and director got-
ten caught up in it a little more. But this 
potential romance is downplayed, and is 
used to make long, dialogue-driven scenes 
that slow down the action and reveal lay-
ers of the dense main characters , allowing 
P enn and Kidman to display their best 
(a nd highly acclaimed) dramatic acting. It 
may be a little too melodramatic at times 
- a prob lem for both of these acmrs - but 
their characters are likable and their rough 
pasts make it easy to sympathize.

Garbage 
Bleed like Me 

Sub Pop 

** 

Remember to years ago? Vaguely? Well that's when Garbage released 
their first album; a fresh 
look at grunge with hard yet 
catchy guitar riffs, a new-
wave productovn sound and 
a female singer with a voice 
both intense and seductive. 
Their sound hasn't changed 
much since then. Blted Like 
Me, Garbage's fourth albwn, 
may very well mark a creative 
dead end for the band. 

With the recent parade 
of female poppers craving 
to be rockers (no need to 
mention names here), l i\~d 

female lead singers have 
moved from being novel 
to being a joke. It would 
seem like a good time for an 
experienced rock vocalist like 
Shirley Manson to step in 
and stop this, but all she does 
is give us a self-pitying cry of 
pain. ill the tide track "Bleed 
Like Me," the words "You 
should see my scars" ring in 
the background; it's enough 
to leave listeners with scars 
of their own. 

Manson is still passionate 
and forceful, but her overly 
depressing lyrics are nor. In 
"Sex Is Not the Enemy," 
Manson dives deep sing-
ing "True love is like gold! 
There's not enough to go 
around." 

The guitar riffs can't save 
this as dley are bland to the 
point where many tracks, 
especially the last few, blur 
together. "Run Baby Run" 
provides the lone exception; 
an experiment in the new-
wave sound that would make 
anyone want to pop in some 
New Order. Maybe Garbage 
should have embraced this a 
little more, instead of trying 
to be so angry all the time.

Will Smith 
lost and Found 

Interscope 

** 

In the hip-hop of the 21st century, gunshot wounds dictate success more than 
talent, and being "hard" is 
the only way to assert cred-
ibility. It is nice to find an 
artist \villing to buck this 
trend, but - shock' - Will 
Smith ain't enough of a trail-
blazer to break the current . 
mold. 

Simply making fun 
of Smith's Lost ond Found 
would be easy (not to men-
tion fun), but there is much 
to be said for some of the 
risks taken by the former 
Fresh Prince. After starting 

wi th three of the most tri te 
party rap songs you'll ever 
hear, "Mr. Niceguy" and 
"Mr. Holy Roller" will leave 
your jaw hanging wide open. 
"'Niceguy" isn't quite a diss 
song, per se, but Smith takes 
shots at many who "mis-
take nice for soft," including 
Eminem and the androg-
enous Wendy Williams. 
"Holy Roller" is less spe-
cific, but equally personal, as 
Smith attacks self-righteous, 
born-again Christians . 
Needless to say, hearing this 
sort of passion coming from 
Smith is rather surprising. 

But many songs sound 
hackneyed and sophomor-
ic. "I Wish I Mllde That" 
sounds more like a rookie's 
attempt at a breakout song 
dlan an old-schooler trying 
to re-establish himself, and 
"Could U Love Me" uses a 
beat mat sOlUlds like it was 
stolen from Fabolous' stu-
dio. The-listener is left with 
one simple question: Why, 
Will Smith, why would you 
make another albwn when 
you make $20 million a 
film)

The (oachwhlps 
Peanut Butter and Jelly 
live at the Ming lounge 

Sire 

***1 In the midst of his fam-ily leaving him, German composer Karlheinz 
Stockhausen starved him-
self for days and wrote 
verses such as the fo llow-
ing: "Play a sound/ Play 
it for so long/ Until you 
feel that you should Stop." 
These pains are evident in 
Stockhausen's work during 
this time. 

San Francisco trio the 
Coachwhips take a similar 
approach to music . 

Except their verses are 
more like : "Don't take 

a shower/ For weeks on 
end/ Until you pound 
down the dirtiest album 
in town." 

Indeed, me Coachwhips' 
raunchy, primal and riff-
heavy garage rock sound 
can only be me result of 
today's young refusing 
to adapt to standardized 
hygiene. 

Peanut Butter- and ]e/Jy 
Live at the Ming Lo!mge 
is not a live album, but it 
fee ls like it came straight 
from the be ll y of a cliched 
shady rock club. While 
the public's fascination 
with garage revivalism 
dies down, the 'whips 
continue the good fight. 

They are, however, 
far more advanced from 
such pseudo- pose rs as 
the Hives or the White 
Stri pes. P'ea1lUt Butter- is 
a wa ll of garage noise 
packed with incoherent 
lyric s. Half the so ngs 
on the record sound the 
same, and that is exactly 
the way a garage album 
should sound : repetitive 
and dirty.

TicketS for the 
performance are 
a bit steep, rang-
ing from $32 to 

ny, which was originally dedicated 
to Napoleon Bonaparte; but when 
Beethoven heard Bonaparte had 
crowned himse.lf emperor, he torc up 
the title page in a betrayed fury. 

$36 for me general public to $18 
for UCS 0 students. Reg-Jrdless, the 
Eroica Trio are a huge thing in the 
business mese days, and they put on a 
technically proficient and enthusiastic 
show. Additionally, the trio perfonns 
exclusively in clothing designed by 
Cannen Marc Valvo, whose evening-
wear can be found in Neiman's and 
Saks everywhere. So t"is is where aJl 
that ticket revenue goes. The Eroica 
Trio \~II perfonn April 23 at 8 p.m. 
in Mandeville Auditorium. 

On the program for their April 
23 perfonnance is Beethoven's "Trio 
in E-Aat, Op. I "; three tangos by 
Astor Piazzola: "Otono Porteno," 

"Obli~on," "Primavera Portena"; and 
lVlaurice Ravel's "Trio in a Minor." 
1ne Beethoven piece fulfills the req-
uisite classical-style piece requirement

Interpreter: 
Stretches 

plausibility 
a bit far 

continued from page 9 
Pollock shows why he is such 

a respected director, contro lling 
the pacing brilliantly. This is most 
evident in the film's strongest 
scene, a super-intense moment in 
the middle of the film where sev-
eral characters converge on a bus, 
all of them in much danger. T he 
end couldn't quite compe te with 
this fantastic sequence, bur Po llock 
gIves it a shot, jump-cutting his way 
through charac ters JUSt to let the 
audience know that things could go 
wrong a t any m o m ent. 

The film s tretches plausibility 
on more than one occasion (ho pe-
fully the real Secret ervice could 
shut down the terrorist act in the 
film or we're all screwed), but hey, 
that's all part of this genre, right? 
Despite the be lievabili ty iss ues, 
"The Interpreter" does enough 
to entertain and manages to hold 
suspense through the whole two 
ho urs , a rare feat for thrillers_ 

Mars: Their 
live show is 
better than 
the record 

continued from page B 
of a blow torch to a roomful of 
addicts, and you beg'in to approach 
the experience offered by Mars 
Volta's live show. Fo r as interest-
ing as Fronces ,be 1I1utr may be in 
the comfort of your own h ome, 
it's elevator music compared to the 
presentation offer~d at a live show. 
On the record, only the musical 
composition ami insttumema[ion 
feed the fire of musical adJiction, 
but during the live show, Mars-
Volta use any means necessary 
to create the most aggressive and 
exciting presentation possible. 

" During the live show, 
Mars Volta use any 
~ necessary to create 

the most aggressive 
presentation possible. " 
To say that a Mars Volta 

show is "high-energy" would be 
an understatement of the highest 
order. Throughout the course of 
their live set, Bixler and Rodriguez 
literally demoy the stage with a 
noisy ferocity that is the envy of 
any self-respecting punk band, but 
the silences in between these sonic 
explosions also somehow manage 
to maintain the same frenetic ener· 
gy. Don't expect too many pauses, 
though; the Mars Volta have been 
known to play two-hour sets with 
nary a break in the music. 

Yelling, screaming, kicking and 
dancing, the musical ghosts of Led 
Zeppelin and Santana are smiling 
down upon the Mars Volta , and if 
you look closely enough you might 
notice that the entire crowd is smil-
ing, too. Despite personal tastes for 
prog rock, or electronica, or Latin 
music or any of the other individual 
styles that come together to form a 
Mars Volta tune, one cannot deny 
that every minute of the combina-
tion is simply irresistible. 

This is 3 highly recommended 
show, and very sold out, so be sure 
to arrive early to ensure that you 
get a decent spot on the dance 
floor. Mars Volta will play RIMAe 
Arena on April 22 .

Track: Hinga 
finishes with 
record 4380 

points 
continued from page ,6 

5000-meter competition and fin-
ished fourth out of 44 runner 
overall. Although she was compet-
ing in the event for the first time, 
McGregor met the NCAA provi-
sional time and placed sixth in the 
nation for Division 1I schools for 
the event. 

"1 thrive off of comperition," 
she said. 

When McGregor strode past a 
former high school rival, who cur-
rently runs with UC Irvine, she was 
exuberant. 

"It was redeemi ng just to show 
how much college training had 
helped me and my race," she said. 

Sophomore teammate Elisa 
Holiday ran the 100-meter dash 
in 12.08 seconds and finished firth 
of 55. 

At the Mt. San Antonio College 
Relays and Heptathlon on April 13, 
I-linga and junior Amy Beeman fin-
ished 12th and I 5th, respectively, 
Out of the 26 competitors. 

The heptathlon event, which 
includes the 100-meter hurdles, 
high jump, shotput, 200, long jump, 
javelin and 800, occurs only twice 
during the track and field season. 

Hinga finished the competition 
with 4380 points - a new school 
record . She competed solid ly 
throughout the two-day competi-
tion, jumping 16 feet, six inches in 
the long jump, throwing for 124-6 
in the javelin and running 2:3!).04 
in the 800. 

Despite her persona l record, 
Hinga says the event was not every-
thing she hoped for . 

"1 was honestly frustrated 
because I didn 't fini sh very strong 
in the 800," she said. "But I was 
pleased that it was a personal best 
for me." 

Beeman set a personal record 
with her finish of 4023 poinrs, the 
third -best finish in school histo-
ry. Beeman finished the 800 in 
2:32.34, while jumping 16-5 in the 
long jump and throwing for 102-6 
in the javelin. 

Hinga and Beeman will concen-
trate on decreasing personal ten-
sion during the event, especially 
for the 800. 

"Amy and I both have the prob-
lem of tightening up instead of just 
relaxi ng and pushing through the 
pain," Hinga said. "But you need to 
be mentally tough and just do it." 

The Tritons track and field 
teams will next compete on April 
22 and April 23 at the UCSD 
Triton Invitational. The first event 
on the opening day will commence

Hernandez reached on an error 
and would score from third base 
on a sacrifice fly from sophomore 
catcher David Morehead. 

With two outs, sophomore des-
ignated hitter John Roth and junior 
outfielder Matt Lawson singled. 
Senior first baseman Brian Robinson 
walked to load the bases for senior 
third baseman Alex Gascon, who 
sent a deep drive over the center-
fielder to clear- the bases and give 
UCSD the 4-0 lead through four 
innings. 

In the sixth inning, Cal Poly 
Pomona second baseman Matthew 
Lopez. hit a one-out triple to cen-
ter field. But Navarro battled 
for the Tritons and produced a 
ground-out and a strikeout to 
end the inning and strand the 
Bronco runner on third as the 
score remained 4-0 UCSD. The 
Tritons added an additional run 
in the bottom of the eighth and 
shutout the Broncos. 

Against Point Lama (28-
12), UCSD junior starter Byron 
Grubman (3-2) pitched six innings, 
allowing six hits, one run and strik-
ing our five. The TritOn bullpen of 
junior Matt Sweany and freshman 
Adam Butler retired the side in 
order for the last three innings, not 
allowing a ball out of the infield. 

Offensively for UCSD, 
Robinson hit a two-run home run 
to break a 1-1 tie in the fourth. In 
the Triton eighth, Roth was hit 
by a pitch and Lawson singled to

Hernandez's two-out RBI single 

to center scored Alarcon for the 8-
1 advantage and eventual win. 

"Obviously, this team has many 
seniors with college experience," 
Triton senior ace Logan Boutilier 
said. "Take the example of the late-
inning games that we've played .... 
We are a lot more mature in those 
situations. We've been there before 
and we have done it and are victori-
ous. In past years we were falling 
in those games, and this year we 
consistently come out more on top. 
Maturity is a big thing for our team 
this year." 

It is this ma turi ty that the 
Tritons must depend upon for 
their final 13 conference games of 
the 2005 season. 

In addition, pitching has been 
key for the Tritons this season 

with Boutilier (8-2) on pace to 
break the school record for single-
season wins of 10, and Lipetz. one 
save away from tying the record 
of seven.

Softball stifles late Stanislaus rally 
Tritons split two-game series against Warriors 

, By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

T he T ritons successfully rallied 
in the second game of their dou-
bleheader against rival Cal State 

tanislaus in Turlock, Calif. , on 
April IS to keep the Warriors from 
sweeping the series. UCSD lost the 
first game by a score of 3-1, before 
coming back to \vin the finale, 7-5. 

UCS O's April 16 doublehead-
er defeat, by scores of 7 -0 and 7 -6, 
respectively, against Chico State, 
(22-1 1 overall, 13 - 10 California 
Collegiate Athl etic Association) 
was a sad loss because the Tritons 
(16-22 overall, 10- 15 CCAA) 
swcpt the Wildcats earlier in the 
first doubleheader meeting of the 
season, with UCS O winning by 
scores of 6-5 and 5-0 on Feb. 25 
at home. 

Although the Tritons took a 
4-0 lead after two innings, Chico 

tate fought back relentlessly with 
two runs in the third and four more 
in the fifth to take a 6-4 lead. 

Nonetheless, the Tritons refused 
to concede the game and tied it up 
agai n in the top of the sixth. 

"Offensively we did well, but 
we couldn 't hold them off," Hurst 
said. 

Both teams had plenty of scor-
ing opportuniti es in the game, 
with Chico leaving 14 runners on 
ba\c and UCSO stranding 10. 

T ritons freshman pitcher 
l kole Fullerton performed well 
Jnd gave up one run on four hits 
in 3.2 innings of work. 

"Full erton shut everybody 
down," Hurst aid. 

After a series of massive hit 
and RBIs from the Wildcats, the 
Triton rally fizzled out ad the 
Wildcats won the day. 

In the first game on April IS, 

the Tritons could not stop Cal 
State Stanislaus' (18-22 overall , 
12- 13 CCAA) relentless plays. The 
Warriors scored three times in the 
first inning on some heads-up base-
running to take the game, 3-1. 

UCSD scored once in the third 
inning and had runners in scoring 
position in the sixth and seventh, 
but cou ld not bring them in. 

The second game saw the 
Tritons explode to a 6- 1 lead. The 
Tritons scored five runs with two 
outs on the board in the second. 

"We came out rea lly strong in 
the first couple of innings," senior 
team captain Jami e Hurst said. 

Preempting the Warriors' 
belated offensive, UCSO tacked 
on a final run in the sixth. 

Although Cal State Stanislaus 
scored four times in the bottom of 
the sixth to cut the lead to 7-5, a 

spirited Triton defense kept their 
opponent from squeezi n~ out any 
more runs in their final at-bat. 

"We played really well and 
had some good hits," Hurst said. 

Several defensive standouts 
emerged in the Tritons' fierce bat-
tle to reject a Cal State Stanislaus 
comeback. 

Freshman pitcher Melissa 
Ward took the win to improve 
to 5-7. 

Junior Jenny Spencer led 
UCSD at the plate, going 3-for-4 
with a pair of runs. 

Senior Breanne Cope plated a 
pair of runs on a home run and 
went 2-for-3 with two runs and a 
pair of RBIs. 

The Tritons return to action 
April 22 through April 24 at 
the Mountain Dew Classic in 
Bakersfield, Calif.

CCAA Championships 
All-Americans Duckworth and 

Dolby earn all-conference honors 
By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's golf team 
placed fifth in a field of eight 
teams at the April 18 and April 
19 California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championships, which 
took place at Hunter Ranch Golf 

, Course in Paso Nobles, Calif. 
The morning of April 18 found 

tile Tritons starting things off with a 
297, nine over par, which put them 
in a tie for fourth place. Following 
what seems to be a pattern, UCSD 
returned in the afternoon to post 
their lowest round of the tourna-
ment, a 289. Unfortunately, the 
pattern continued into the follow-
ing morning, when the Tritons 
turned in their highest scoring 
round, a 298. Overall, this gave 
UCSD a tournament score of 884, 
20 over par. 

Competition was clearly cut-
throat, as Cal State Bakersfield and 
Chico State actually tied for first 
place before going into a playoff. 
Both squads posted a final score of 
877, with Bakersfield doing it by 
rounds of 298, 287 and 292, while 
Chico shot 302, 283 and 292 . In a 
tieoreaker, Bakersfield pulled ahead 
to claim first place. 

Cal State San Bernardino missed 
a three-way tie for first by one 
stroke, finishing with an 878, earn-
ing rounds of291, 286 and 301. Cal 
State Stanislaus was also right in the 
fray, coming in fourth with an 881 . 
Stanislaus shot 290 and 294 on in 
the first two rounds, respectively, 
and 297 ori' April 19. 

Cal State Monterey Bay just 
missed UCSD to take sixth place, 

earning rounds of 303, 293 · and 
289, respectively, to finish with 
an 885. Sonoma State University 
found itself in eventh place after 
shooting rounds of 297 and 290 on 
April 18 and 3 lO on April 19, for a 
total of 897. Cal State Dominguez 
Hills rounded out the pack of eight 
teams with a 974 off rounds of 317, 
336and3 21. 

Individually, senior Brian 
Duckworth once again took the 
lead for the Tritons, and placed in 
the top 10, finishing in a tie for sev-
enth place with a 220, four over par. 
Ouckworth started things off with 
an even par 72 in the early round on 
Apri l 18, and returned in the after-
noon with a 73 . On April 19, he 
earned a 75. Duckworth 's perfor-
mance in this tournament and over 
the course of the season was more 
than good enough to earn him a 
place on the A11 -CCAA team. 

Sophomore Luke Leveillee con-
tinued to show that he will be a big 
part of the Tritons' future, as he 
managed to earn a tie for 11 th place 
with a total score of 221. Leveillee 
earned a 75 on the morning of April 
18, and then came back to post two 
consecutive scores of 73 . 

Senior Joe Dolby, third for 
the Tritons, tied for 15th overall. 
Dolby turned in a 76 in the early 
round on April 18, but came out 
that afternoon to turn in a 69, 
the low score for UCSD in the 
tournament. Unfortunately, Dolby 
slipped a little on April 19, posting 
a 77, and finished with a 222. Dolby 
also earned himself a spot on the 
A11-CCM roster.
