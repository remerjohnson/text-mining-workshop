AS-CaIPIRG Rally 
By Doug Campion 

Science Editor 
Nuclear power was verbally 

attacked from all sides at a 
noon rally co-sponsored by the 
Associated Students (AS) and 
CalPIRG Friday in front of 
the gym. Speakers addressed 
the issue from s,everal 
different perspectives , 
including environmental, 
health and economic aspects. 

Karen Orsulak of the 
Community Energy Action 
Network (CEAN) dealt with 
the monetary issues relating 
to nuclear power production 
and the potential dangers 
stemming from it. Citing a 
study conducted by the 
Atomic Energy Commission, 
Orsulak said it had been 
projected that about 27,000 
people could be killed in a 10-
mile wide circle surrounding 
a nuclear power plant should a 
serious accident occur. She 
went on to estimate a possible 
expense resulting from such a 
disaster to be somewhere 
around $17 billion. Noting that 
the liability of the insurance 
coverage of nuclear facilities 
is limited to about $500 
million, she concluded that 
"the injured would have to 
make up the difference." 

"Another big problem with 
nuclear power is dealing with 
nuclear waste," said Orsulak. 
She mentioned the amount of 
time required for complete 
radioactive decay, which 
often stretches out millions of

on p. 12 

years, and the history of 
poor1y designed waste 
disposal systems. "We've 
been in the nuclear age for 30 
years," she said, " and to date 
there is still no satisfactory 
means o( disposal." 

Orsulak noted also that 
after a nuclear power plant 
has been in use for several 
years. it must be "decom-
missioned" in order to avoid 
the dangers brought on the 
facility by the passage of 
time. "Estimates for-
decomissioning ," according 
to Orsulak, .. are from 25-100% 
of the original cost of building 
(the plant) . " She added, "The 
federal government has no 
real -plans for waste disposal 
or decommissioning." 

The audience heard second 
speaker Glen Barlow draw 
from his work on geological 
studies to discuss the San 
Onofre nuclear power plant 
specifically, and its suscepti-
bility to dumage from earth-
quakes, 

According to 'Barlow, there 
are several earthquake faults 
located in the vicinity of San 
Onofre, the closest being only 
3000 feet away from the 
generators. 

Barlow also mentioned the 
possibility that the Rose 
Canyon fault, which is located 
offshore of La Jolla, might be 
connected with the fault zone 
in the area of San Onofre, 40 
miles north of here. If this 
were found to be correct, he 
speculated, the faults could 
combine to produce an 
earthquClke of far greater

Revelle Provost Named 
Chia-Wei Woo, Physicist from Northwestern, 
Picked by Saltman, Still Faces Faculty, Regents 

By John Hondros 
Associate News Editor 

Chia-Wei Woo, a professor of 
Physics at Northwestern 
University, has been chosen for 
the post of Revelle College 
Provost, Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Paul 
Saltman announced Friday. 

Saltman was responsible for 
electing one of the toree 

candidates recommended by 
the Revelle Provost Search 
Committee to fill the po ition 
left vacant by June Tapp last 
yea r . 

Saltman ' d ec is ion is 
contingent on two facto'r : It 
will first have to go through 
faculty review, then it will have 
to be cleared by the Regents. 

" It was an extraordinarily 
difficult decision to ma ke," 
rem a rked Sallman , who 
delayed announcing hi s choice 

for a week because he was 
" seriously torn between two of 
the finalists (Woo and UCSD 
Professor of History Stanley 
Chodorow) ," 

8altman selected Woo 
because "he was universally 
perceived as an exciting person 
for the post and a fun person to 
work with ." According to 
Saltman, Woo received the 
highest ranking from the 
Search Committee. 

Mary Anne, Rodgers , student 
member on the 8earch 
Committee, said she is " very 
enthused" about Woo. 

" Woo will be coming to the 
campus with new ideas ... the 

niver ity will benefit from 
hav ing new blood ," a id 
Rodgers. 

"( Love UCSD" 
Woo wa a n a sistanL 

resea rch physicist at UCSD 

from 1966 to 1968, and, as he 
commented from his home in 
Northbrook, III. yesterday, 
" loved it." 

"It has always been my 
obsession to get back (to 
UCSD), " remarked Woo. 

Woo said he visits UCSD 
" roughly once a year .. J've 
seen the University grow, and 
it's very exciting." 

Woo commented that he likes 
the concept of four individual 
colleges and philosophies at 
UCSD . This concept makes the 
University " rare," said Woo, 
adding that he would "like to 
see these separate characters 
kept. " 

Woo said he admires Revelle 
College for its " strict " 
graduation requirements .

Emergency Meeting Called Over Armitage Move 
By John Hondros 

Associate News Editor 
The Registratiolf Fee 

Committee held an emergency 
meeting Friday because of 
"substantial" budget cut 
suggestions made to Chan-
cellor McElroy by Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Richard Armitage. , 

Armitage identified a 
$229.048 cut in Student Services 
funds-to the Chancellor without 
first consulting the Committee, 
Chair Kenzie Nicoll argued at 
the meeting, which was held to 
"bring this matter out into the 
open." 

Armitage said he made his 
move upon the request of the 
Chancellor that he propose 

AS Elections 

ways in which a $180,000 
reduction in the Student 
Services budget might be 
accomplished effective July 1, 
1979. 

Armitage explained that he 
did not consult the Reg Fee 
Committee at the time because 
he "preferred not to interrupt 
the timeta ble of the Committee 
until its basic annual budget 
review was completed." 

According to Campus Budget 
Officer Robert Oakes, the 
impact on student services 
from the University budget cut 
"won't be very much." 

"The Chancellor is seeing to 
it that the student side of the 
house is treated fairly, " said 
Oakes. 

However, Don Strebel, a 
UCSD graduate student , 
contended that Student 
Services will be cut by 23 
percent - :'more than double 
the cut any other area is 
getting." 

Before th~ meeting, Nicoll 
said he was angry with 
Armitage because he " iden-
tified almost $230,000 in 
(Student Services) cuts rather 
than $180,000 like he was 
supposed to ... and he failed to 
consult with any people on the 
Committee." 

Armitage ' s budget cut 
recommendations were "not 
representative" of the 
Committee, Nicoll commented.

Filing Deadline Extended 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Associate Manarlng Editor 

The election filing ,dea~line 
for college council and AS 
college representatives has 
been postponed from today 
until Friday, Marietta 
Williams, Acting Student 
Org~nizations Advisor decided 
yesterday. 

The last chance for AS 
Commissioners and Presi-
dential and Vice Presidential 
candidates to register their 
candidacy will remain today at 
noon, Williams also ruled. 

The deadline was originally 
set for today at noon for all 
candidates, but Phil Ganezer, 
Elections Commissioner. told 
The Guardi.an advertising 
department Friday that he was 
extendin" the dPadline, later 

getting Williams' approval. 
Ganezer, reached yesterday, 

said he made the change in 
response to pressure from the 
college Deans, who, led by 
Revelle Dean Ernie Mort, say 
they were not told by their 
college representatives until 
Friday that the filing deadline 
was today. 

Ganezer's move aroused 
considerable interest in the AS, 
though. The AS Council set the 
election timetable last quarter 
and several Council members 
objected that Ganezer's move 
exceeded his authority. 

So , Williams decided 
yesterday to move the 
Commissioners filing date back 
to the original period, leaving 
the college choices where they 
are now. 

.. Campaigning for represen-
tatives positions will begin 
Friday noon. Commissioners 
will still start their campaigns 
tomorrow at noon . Those 
representatives who have 
completed their elections 
petitions before Friday may 
begin campaigning as soon as 
they hand those petitions in, 
Williams said. 

Williams is acting for Randy 
Woodard , who is in Washing-
ton, D.C. this week. Woodard is 
acting for Tom Brown, who left 
the position this past February. 

Williams says she has no 
constitutional basis for 
delaying the electioo, but AS 
President John Jenkel and 
Ganezer have said that they 
upport her move "com-

pletely."

College View of 
Boycott Explained 

Editor: 
Every so often, a situation 

a rises which a llows students to 
throw off their accustomed 
passivity and take an active 
part in the determination of the 
quality o[ their a cademic lives. 
That this situation exists and 
that students are willing to take 
advantage of it, I hope will be 
proven by their active 
participation in the scheduled 
vending machine boycott this 
week. 

Why boycott? What possible 
effect could candy bars have on 
student life? A large per-
centage of vending machine 
rayenoes have in the past been 
allocated to the four college 
councils and the Graduate 
Student Council and have 
enabled thue bodies to fund a 
variety of events which further 
the Interests of their con-
stituencies. These funds have 
gone toward senior graduation, 
freshman orientation. picnics. 
lbe Muir Day on tJ\e Green and 
lbe Revelle Almost Anything 
Goes, tonamejusta few events. 
Last summer Chancellor 
McElroy made the decision to 
place these funds entirely 
under the juri8dicUon of Food 
Services with the OItensible 
purpose of paying 0(( an 
accrued debt, 

Quite obviously. this leaves 
lbe coIlep couacUs and the 
GSC without lullds. Or does It? 
We are told that we may 
receive alternate funding 
through Reg Fee. How reliable 
Is such funding? It is well-
known that Reg Fee allocates 
on a year to year non-
discretionary basis. This point 
is an importa'nt one. Thecollege 
councils and the GSC are used 
to having the ability to decide 
what they wish to tum their 
money toward. This, after all, 
is t.!le reason ,)!olleges were 
instituted In the Cirst place: 
they were each to develop 
unique characteristics, unique 
personalities which would 
engender feelings of belinging 
fn their students . Non-

Editor 

di~retiona ry or even limited 
discretiona ry funding curta ils 
the colleges ' a nd the graduate 
students' rights to decide what 
type of institutions they wish to 
have. If we dispute these rights, 
we might as well all transfer to 
UCLA and be done with 
colleges alltogether. 

The fac t tha t Cha ncellor 
McElroy expropriated these 
funds without student consent 
does not bode well forthe future 
of student say in the quality a nd 
the extent of their university 
educatioos. We are at school , I 
hope, to lea rn independence 
and wisdom. It is neither 
independence nor wisdom to 
have funds previously 
controlled by students removed 
without the slightest con-
$ultatlon. Accepting this is 
tantamount to admitting that 
student funding is .merely an 
allowance to be bestowed or 
withheld by administrators 
holding parental roles. 

We are boycotting to make a 
statement that we are not 
children, that we are 
independent, that we are wise 
enough to know how to allocate 
our own funds (vending 
machine revenues, after all, 
rome mainly out of students' 
pockets) . Our aim is to have 
separate contracta lor vending 
machines; that is, the 
adminilltration will control the 
revenues of some vending 
machines on campus , the 
students will control the 
revenues of others. We are 
boycotting to prove to the 
administration that we are not 
willing to settie for less than 
what we believe to be equita ble. 

Where does this leave you? I 
am asking you and all your 
friends to participate in this 
boycott and make it work. I 
think it's time UCSD students 
gain spirits other than those 
necessary only for getting into 
Medical School . It 's not too 
much to ask. All you have to do 
is abstain from eating candy 
bars between Monday and 
Friday. You'd be dOing your 
body a favor.

Nuke Scare Nothing New 
At Least 7 Previous Accidents Missed Headlines; 
Scientists Who Challenged Industry Got Shaft 

By Harvey Wasserman 
Pacific News Service 

Radioactive steam pouring out 01 the Three. 
Mile Island nuclear power plant near 
Harrisburg. Penn.. has driven home the 
ultimate question about atomic energy - can 
we afford to keep these plants operating? 

Through it all. the nuclear industry has 
repeatedly assured the public that the plants 
are safe. But for more than a decade. some of 
the world's leading doctors and scientists have 
been warning about the dangers of nuclear 
energy. Dr. John Gofman, co-discoverer of 

There are now 70 active nuclear power 
plants in the U.S. with 90 under construction, 
an overall average of more than three for 
every state In the union. Nearly every major 
American city is within 50 miles of at least one. 
Chicago is ringed with them, as is, to a lesser 
extent, New York City. 

Do the risks of another Three Mile Island 
outweigh the staggering capital and energy 
costs of dismantling this mammoth nuclear 
program? 

A lonttime anU-nuclear activist. Harvey 
Wasserman bas written lor the Boston Globe, 
the Nation, the Progressive and PNS. A 
collecllon of his articles on nuclear energy will 
be published under the Utle Energy War: 
Reports from the Front. by ~awrence Hill this 
fall. 

Consider the following : 
In 1957 a major accident occurred at the 

Windscale reactor in England . Massive 
radiation leakages forced the confiscation of 
cows and sheep for many square miles. 
Thousands of gallons of contaminated milk 
were dumped into the Irish Sea and abnormal 
radiation levels were recorded as far away as 
London, 300 miles distant. 

In 1966, the Fermi I reactor at Monroe, 
Michigan suffered a partial meltdown. The 
plant had been bitterly opposed by the UAW. 
which took its case all the way to the Supreme 
Court, but was otherwise a mystery to most 
residents of the state. On October 5 of that 
year , the plant experienced an emergency 
shutdown that forced its operators to consider 
the possibility of evacuating Detroit. 

In 1975, a major catastrophe occurred atthe 
Browns Ferry, Ala. , nuclear plant. The 
accident began when a workman , inspecting 
some wiring with a candle. ignited a $100 
million fire tha t threatened a holocaust even 
worse than what 's now happening in 
Pennsylvania. 

Last year, a nother major accident occurred 
at the Duane Arnold reactorinIowa. And there 
have been others - at theSL-1 reactor in Idaho 
where three men were killed; at two separate 
expe-rimental reactors in Canada: and at a 
nuclear dump in the Soviet Union where 
indications a re strong that an a rea of70 square 
miles wa s obliterated. 

None of these accidents made headlines . In 
fact , I was an editor of a daily newspaper and a 
UPI correspondent in Ann Arbor 40 miles from 
the Fermi pla nt when th e 1966 uccident 
occurred. But neithe l' l nor a nyone else I knew 
heard a word about it until se\'en yeurs I<lte r . 
with the publicution of J ohn G. Fuller's " We 
Almost Lost Det roit. " 

uranium 233 isotope and a participant in the 
Manhattan project that developed the atomic 
bomb, predicted five years ago that normal 
operation of American nuclear reactors _ 
even without a m~or accident - could cause 
some 30,000 additional deaths each year from 
cancer, leukemia and birth defects. 

Dr. Ernest Sternglass of the University of 
Pittsburgh has repeatedly published findings 
that residents of the area near the shipping 
port reactor close to Pittsburgh ha~e suffered 
from abnormal cancer rates. Dr. Thomas 
Mancuso, also of the University of Pittsburgh, 
has found that nuclear workers also suffer 
abnormal cancer rates. 

And there have been others: Dr. Rosalie 
Bertel. Dr. Martha Drake. Dr. HelenCaldicott, 
all with the same basic warning. And all 
receiving the same basic response - ridicule 
from the industry. loss of jobs. suppression of 
statistics. 

Mancuso's study of Hanford Cor a federal 
agency was suppressed. Gofman was e<Jsed 
out of his job at Lawrence Livermore 
Labor<Jtories. 

It wasn't really until May , 1977, when 2,000 
members of the Clamshell Alliance marched 
onto a nuclear site at Seabrook, N.H .â¢ that 
'ltomic energy became an issue widely 
debated by mainstream America. At that, it 
took the rather bizarre spectacle of Governor 
Meldrim Thompson locking 1 . 400 
demonstrators in the national guurd armories 
before <Jtomic energy became a really hot 
topic. 

Why did it take people getting arrested en 
masse to grab attention for this issue ? Had 
"The China Syndrome" not been released this 
month , would the networks be providing 
substantial coverage to the Three Mile Island 
accident ? 

Through it all. there rem<lins one overriding 
question . How many more Three Mile Islands 
will it take before the nucle<Jr industry is 
stopped ? 

For months now . the press has been 
proclaiming the premature death of the 
nuclear industry. Soaring construction costs. 
uncertain fuel supply, slumping electrical 
demand â¢ .md rising political opposition have 
dampened th e climate for nuclear 
construction. More than 100 reactors were 
ordered by Americ.m utilities in the early 
1970s: less than 10 have been added since 1976, 
with many of the others cancelled or 
postponed. 

Today the anti-nuclear movement has 
largely concentra ted on plunts under 
construction, such a Seabrook. There have 
been some <lUempts to close down operating 
re<lctors. e specia lly at Trojan . Oregon and the 
notorious Vermont Yankee plant a t Ve rnon.

" nuc lear lemon ."

Q 

UCSD Backs 
Development 

Shops Would Ease Mesa Isolation 
By Kathy Hurfer 

Associale News Editor 
While final approval of plans 

for a development neur Mesa 
AparLments has not been 
granted. UCSD's Campus and-
Communit y Planning Com-
mittee has indicated its support 
of the project. 

The proposed Brittany 
Village. to be located directly 
east of the Mesa Apartments, 
h<ls been under scrutiny by the 
committee for several months. 
Although the project will not be 
on university-owned land . the 
committee is involved with . 
making recommendations to 
both the city <lnd developers. 

According to Lea Rudee. 
committee chairman . a 
recommendation has been 
made which is "generally 
favor.able" of the development. 
He was unable to elaborate on 
the recommendation. 

Plans for .Bril.t<lny Village 
have undergone several 
revisions since the concept fi rst 
originated in January of 1978. 
Initial plans called for 600 
residential units and space for 
commerica l use. While 
commerci<ll plans have not 
altered, developers have 
reduced the number of resident 
units and have added plans (or 
a 3Oo-room "hoptel. " 

The hoptel. a combination of 
regular hotel rooms and rooms 
a vaila ble for 'rent , will attract 
vi itors to the university 
instead of " the typical tourist 
off the freeway," accordingtoa 
committee meeting report . 

More thun 550 condominiums 
and apartments aI-e included in 
the development plun s. 
Recrealion and food facilities 
will be constructed ne<.lr the 
residential units. 

In addition , several com-
mercial buildings will be 
included in the 27.5 acre 
development. A supermarket , 
drug store and retail facilities 
will <llso be built on the 
property. 

"Mesa students aye very 
isolated from things," Rudee 
commented. Brittany Village 
would offer Mesa residents 
" convenience shop s " and 
grocery facilities, and reduce 
this sense of isolation, he said . 

Evan Fletcher. a resident at 
Mesa who opposes the 
development, said that traffic 
and safety problems will arise 
as a result of the increused 
population in the ar ea. 

According to thecommitlee's 
data , the averuge daily traffic 
(ADT) on Regents Roud , 
location of the Mesu upurt-
ments , wus 1,800 in 1977.

Harvard Sweeps Crew Classic 
By Phillip Stuller 

The Seventh Annual San 
Diego Crew Classic was held 
Saturday and not surprisingly, 
Ivy League power Harvard 
dominated the meet. Thou-
sands lined the shores of 
Mission Bay and saw UCSD 
rowers race against major 
college teams. 

The Varsity Eight Grand 
Final (eight rowers with 
coxswain in 1.1 2,000 meter 
course) was won easily by 
Harvard . in six minutes and 
twelve seconds. Following the 
Crimson eight were UC 
Berkeley , University of 
Wisconsin, University or 
Ptmnsylvaniu, Brown Univer-
sity and Navy . Neithel' 
defending NCAA champion 
Washington nor International 
Rowing Associution titlelist 

Tritons Go Nowhere, But Fast In Cal Cup Quest 
Sy racuse managed to qualify 
for the final from their first 
heuts. 

The major race for the lower 
echelon schools was the Cal Cup 
won by Long Beach State 
followed by San Dieog State und 
StanCord. 

Best performances by UCSD 
were seen by the men's 
lightweight eight and the 
women's lightweight eight. The 
men took an early lead in their 
qualifying heat. but slowed at 
the halfway (l,OOOmeter) mark 
to finish third behind Loyola 
and Santa Clara. 

In the finals, the Tritons 
again burst into the lead, but 

could not fight off Washington, 
the west coast powerhouse. As 
Wushington took a com -
manding two to three 
boatlengths lead, it was a butt Ie 
between UCSD, Loyola and 
Berkeley for second. With only 
u.couple of feet separating the 
three at the 1.800 meter-mark, 
Loyola made a strong sprint Cor 
the finish to take second. with 
Berkeley und UCSD tmiling, 

Lead by veterans Susi 
Luftner, Connie Sullivan, 
Astrid Holgerg und Karen 
Butler, the women's light-
weight eight finished a strong 
third , seconds behind Berkeley . 
Washington took top place in 

thut race but the team wus 
optimistic. "No one's going to 
write off UCSD anymore, said 
coxswuin Amita Desai, 
"They're going to have to 
contend with us." 

The heavyweight four ran 
into troulbe in theil' mce, which 
included crews Crom Harvard 
and Michigan State . 

The novice men .und women 
did not fare well in their race . 
The men got off to a bad start 
when one or the rowers lost his 
seut and others caught crubs. 
As they tried to recover, the 
other teums dashed uwuy at the 
start leuving the UCSD squ<ld 
behind . Nevertheless. the 

Tritons were able to catch the 
Mission Bay Rowing Associa-
tion boat. 

The women finished firth in 
their race. "Our coxswain in 
the race had the boat in a good 
position," said coach Jack 
Vallerga, "But the other novice 
coxswains were ort position and 
forced our boat in a bad 
position," The result was the 
shortening of a 1,000 meter race 
into u 750 meter race, 

The freshmen crew lead by 
Bob Jones took a third place in 
their heat behind Washineton 
and Irvine, but finished last 
among a strong field in the 
fina ls. 

The men's and women's 
novice squads placed sixth and 
fifth , respectively, in their 
races, each managing to beat 
one other team, 

Women's Track Tr~ounces Pt. Lama 
BJ' Jon Goelz 

Senior Siall Writer 
Karen Hunter and ' Sherre 

Lilley paced the women 's track 
team to u 44-28 victory over host 
school Pt. Loma Saturday. 

Lilley placed first in three of 
five field events and also won 
the javelin throw with a 102 foot 
effort. and finished first in the 
shot put with u 32 feet !W~ inch 
effort. She took seco'nd in the 
long jump and high jump to Sue 
C<lrnahun of. Pt. " Lorna . 
Running her first lOll since she 
was in high school. Lilley won in 
13.9 seconds and missed the' 
school record by 3110 of a 
second. She is working toward 

Hunter and Lilley Pace Tritons. in 44-28 Victory 
an eventual pent'athlon 
competition next season. 

Hunter complemented 
Li lley's wins with three ,of her 
own in the middle und long 
distance runs. Her 2: 41.8 800 
time and 5: 31.51500 finish were 
good for victories . and she won 
thE' 3000 in 12: 06 .1 by a 20 second 
margin . 

. 'Kuren is quite u remarkable 
athlete," said coach Gruham 
Parnell. "She's been improving 
tremendously in the past few 

weeks und I'm euger to see 
whut she c<ln do in the next few 
weeks." 

Two newcomers to UCSD 
track bot.h placed in their first 
meet Cor the Tritons, Juh-
Waundee Cham'pion, after one 
week of practice, took second in 
the juvelin, third in the lOll , and 
third in the long jump .â¢ Her 
friend Rose Murie Wolgamut, 
also after one week of working 
out. Look seconds in the shot put 
and discus throw in her j irst 
competition. 

"They're good sports," suid 
Purnell . "they just jump in, 
work hurd, and don't com-
plain." 

MEN'S TRACK 
Hampered by their lack of 

depth in the sprints, the men's 
track team lost to Pt. Lomu but 
bcul Chapman College in a tri-
meet Suturday . 

"As always . the meet a~uinst 
, Pt. Lomu was our best meet of 
the season." said coach Andy 
Skier. "We just didn't have u 
sufficient number of people. 
The few who didn' t uttend the 
'meet could hÂ·<.Ive scored Cl point 
01' two more in each event." 

UCSD did dominate some 
events. but lacked the all-
around prol'iciency to top their 
rivuls from the peninsula . 

Several field event victories 
went to the Tritons. Chris Sando 
and Bob Peterson finished 1-2 in 
the high jump. Sundo cleared 
6':l" for the victory. 

l.QQ Doubles Thrown 

Kevin Seeman placed first in 
both .the long jump and ..,iple 
jump. His 22'2 3h" long jump 
topped Triton decathlete John 
Sereno's 20'7" second place 
finish. Seeman's 44' triple jump 
also won, with Greg ~ronga in 
second with a 39'6" leap. Ken 
Clifton vuulted to a third in the 
pole vuult ut II feet . 

John Sereno lOok the only 
victories in the running events 
with first in the LID and 400 
meter hurdles. He will be 
competing in the Cal Poly 
Pomon<\. decath Ion on the 21 st of 
this month. 

Rich Schmidt, Ed Lee,and 
EUI'I Cabanas finished 2-3.-4 in 
the 100 meter sgrinl.. No Triton 
finished better thun third in any-
of the longel- runs, though. 
Scott Bernstein placed third in 
the 200, Jon Halperin took third 
in the 800 and Pete Dolan 
finished third in the 1500. 

Pt. Lorna Cops Tennis Win 
By Pam Gold 

The score was 4-4 as the 
crowd watched Beth Alley und 
Chris Enright of the women 's 
tennis leum butlle Pt. Lorna 's 
third doubles team . The 
winners would break the tie und 
determine the finul outcome or 
hlst Tllul-sdtly's tennis match. 

UCSf> yielded 6-4. 4-6, 3-6, 
fighting ,~t ..,n to the wire 
in 11 losing effort, resulting in a 
4-5 . overall defeut for the 
Tritons. 

Couch Pat Stewart ex-
plained, " Pl. Lorna threw their 
first doubles in order to 
strengthen their second and 
third doubles. Theypuiredtheir 
first and sixth,ranked players 

thei I' chance of victory in the 
oth 'J' double matche ." 

Excitement mounted <.IS the 
mutch was split at 3-3 after 
singles action . Debbie 
Shupiro's unerring ground-
strokes lead her to u 6-3. 7-5 win 
over PI. Lomu's first ingles 
player, as she relentlessly ran 
her opponent Crom corner to 
(.'Orner. 

According to Stewart , "It 
was obvious from the start th:!t 
Debbie had the edge and wus 
gOing to win."

Money Concert Uninspired 
In those not so distant days 

when going to rock concerts 
was t.he highlight of my life, I 
usually managed to have a good 
time regardless Â·of the 
circumstances. If the sound 
was lousy, I'd put my fingers in 
my ears and listen to the guitar 
player take one of those endless 
slow blues solos and pretend 
that rock and roll now had an 
improvi sational base that 
reveled jazz. If the band was 
terrible, l'd spend my time 
smoking other people 's 
marijuana . or space out on the 
alphabet-soup of drugs I'd 
taken prior to the concert and 
amuse my addled senses with 
the faces of the crowd. 

Years pass, though, and not 
surprisingly my attitudes have 
changed towards rock and roll . 
I demand more these days, 
small things that I don' t think 
are too unreasonable to expect: 
good songwriting , strong 
playing, inspiration , some 
amount of blood and guts 
vitality. Too orten, though, 
what's served up is something 
very, very, professional . and 
very, very dry, Much of the

rock and roll that sells these 
days is slick, workmanlike, and 
bereft of imagination. There 
was a good double dose 
example or this at last 
Suturday's Eddie Money 
concert in the MLiin Gym. 

Sad CLlCe, the opening act, 
were the more " proCessional " 
of the two <:Icts. professional in 
the sense thut they ' re overLIlI 
<:ItLitude wa one of clocking in 
for yet another shift ' at the 
plant. Their sound WLiS tight. 
the instrumental talent was 
high, and their style was 
varied , but there w as 
absolutely no character to their 
act. They bridged several 
motifs - funk, jazz/ fusionl 
English progressive-rock, Lind 
hard rock - with enough skill, 
but their performance had no 
real cutting edge, no identi-
fi<:lble center, no memorable 
melodies or hook riffs to come 
away with. Over all, Sad Cafe 
was a mish-mash of ap-
proaches, sounding like a band 
who couldn't make up their 
mind who they wLinted to 
emulate.

other hand. seems like a nice 
guy. Running around the stage, 
twirling the wmbourine as 
though it were a baton , 
grabbing the microphone and 
belting the songs with 
admirable passion , Money 
exuded LI nuturLiI exhubel'ance 
that's rare in these days of acts 
behLlving LIS though they' re 
doing the audience a favor. His 
voice is a strong . husky, bluesy 
bellow in the tradition of Mitch 

,Rydel' and Eric Burdcn. Li nd he 
hLi the skill. like that of Joe 
Cocker at his best. to wrench 
out honest emotion from lyrics 
that would otherwise be sad-
sack sentimentLility. 

Money, though, was beset by 
a band whose ability to give the 
performance a distinct 
dimension, sounding too often 
like the faceless L A session 
men whose run-of-the-mill 
competence has ruined many a 
potentially good pel'formance. 
Only the occasional lyricism of 
guitarist Jimmy Lyon shined 
th'rough the apathetic morass, 
yet even he didn' t seem to be 
putting out us well as he could.

T onio K Paints Bleak 
World Laced With Humor 
Tonio K brings modern 

civilization into musical focu 
with their debut album LHe In 
The Foodchain. The title cut 
explLlins the dirty gLime of 
politics Lind tormenting love 
LlffLlir in terms of one simple 
biological fact: "It 's do 01' 
die/ It's down to push and 
shove / becLlllse everybody ' s 
hungry and there ain 't just 
quite enough." 

There is not yet a category 
this sound fLills readily into, 
though its base is a I'Ock should 
.i milar to that of the J . Geils 
Ba nd. Laye red on th is is a blend 
of country funk Lind no -
nonsense punk. Thi is done 
with the help of the many 
ar tists who appear on the 
album. Among them are Earl 
Slick (ex-Bowie guilLlrist), 
Albert Lee and ex-Band 

keyboardist Gl.Irth Hudson . The 
lyrics are potent poetry 
examining politic , love and 
pluin human survival , giving <:I 
pretty bleak picture on the 
world's slate of a ffl.l irs. The 
instmmenLI trl.lnsitions are 
from hurd meWI to funk put 
humor into the album. 

TLike. for example, "Funky 
Westel'll Ci vi lization." The 
gui lal' on this cut is so twangy 

th~lt it reminds one of clucking 
chicken " But the song is no 
country-western workout - not 
with lyrics like "They putJesus 
on the cross/They put a hole in 
JFK/ They put Hitler in the 
driver seat. .. I Just because 
we ' re hypnotized don' t mean 
we just can ' t dance." 

Tonio K seems to accept the 
present human condition . 
Touches like a French feamle 

voice singing the chorus in 
" Funky Western Civilization" 
demonstrates the band ' s 
sa tirical and intelligent flair. 

Life in The Food Chain 's 
closing song, "Hatred," is 
ingeniou . The ear-jerking 
transformation of a sweet blue-
grass intro into bilter punk 
rock in this song is a startling 
contrast. The group spells out 
the meaning of hatred with 
more power than a speaker at a 
stadium political rally. This 
love song is a concise and fast-
paced Ramones ballad. 

I guarantee nothing will 
come 10 your ears quite like the 
futuri tic l1.Ilent oC Tonio K. It's 
not what one would call 
progressive in sound, but it is 
progressive in the industry and 
to we huml.lns of 1979.

"One. two. three. four. get the

supporters at a community 
rally on Saturday in Balboa 
Park. The rally was sponsored 
by tbe Community Energy 
Action Network. (CEAN) in 
response to the nuclear react()r 
accident at Three Mile Island in 
Harrisburg. Pennsylvania. 

CEAN spokesman Jim 
Jacobson said " We're calling 
for the shutdown of San Onofre 
and all nuclear plants in this 
country." 

Jacobson cited the fact that 
San Onofre was built aCter the 
discovery of a faUlt . 1.5 miles 
away from the plant. Another 
fault. located 3000 ft. from the 
plant wu considered to be

hear flOw is, let's close the 
plants." Lingo said, "very little 
inCormation is getting out a bout 
the good side." 

Rally speakers elaborated on 

the health hazards of rcldiation, 
radioactive wastes and 
alternative sources of energy. 
Speaker Richard Wharton said 
radioactive elements are 
released into the air and water 

during the normal operation oC 
a nuclear power plant. Wharton 
said. " The radiation from one 
x-ray can cause damage to the 
Cetus if it's not directly focused 

(Please turn &0 page 13) 

Jacobson said that if a 
meltdown occurred at San 
Onofre it would affect everyone 
within a 70-mile radius oC the 
site.He added that no adequate 
evacuation exists Cor these 
areas. 

Representatives from the 
John Bi rch Society protesting 
at the rally said there was no 
reason to shut down a ny 
nuclear plant because , 
"nothing has happened yet."

form oC energy. Nuclear plants 
aren't bombs." 

Lingo said the people should 
decide whether or not they want 
the plants shut down after both 
sides have been clearly 
presented. Lingo believes that 
right now people aren't in a 
position to deciae one way or 
the other because the 
information on nuclear power

intensity than had been 
prepared for in the conÂ· 
struction of the San Onofre 
nuclear power facility . 

According to Barlow. " If 
you had a Cull meltdown after 
a n earthquake you would only 

, have a few hours to evacuate 
everyone." He added that the 

, quake would probably also 
damage freeway systems and 
roadways , hindering any 
effort to move the popillation 
oC San Diego away from 
danger. 

Citing the proximity of the 
San Onofre plant, and the Cact 
that "the wind usually blows 
in this direction from San

his disapproval of the use of 
nuclear power for generating 
electricity: ,Â· It 's really a 
matter of s urviva l," he said, 
" H's even heavier tha n Viet 
Nam - it aCCects each of us 
directly ... 

After a brief description by 
medical student Val Cata n-
zarite of the ill effects 
r a diation has on human 
health , AS Lobby Annex 
Di rector Linda Sabo dis-
cussed tbe use of nuclear 
power in the development of 
weaponry. 

Speaking about the work 
done at UC's Lawrence 
Livermore Labonllories, 
Sabo said .â¢ ' Fifty percent plus 
oC their time and energy is 

spent on weapons . " She 
added, " H seems that our 
motto 'Let there be light ' 
when it comes to the labs is 
'Let there be light - one big 
flash .' .. 

In an effort to " put 
pressure" on the universi ty to 
stop weapons research. Sabo 
said that a sit-i n a t the 
Livermore labs is being, 
organized . A meeting to 
discuss this action will be held 
today at 4: 30 in the North 
ConCerence Room of the 
Student Center. 

Those who attended the 
rally Friday also heard "anti-
nuke" Colk songs performed 
by the group " Bread and 
Roses ."

he remarked. "The general 
philosophies (of Revelle) are 
<.I II to my liking." 

Woo . who is curre ntl y 
ch<.lirm(.ln of the Physics

n iversity. was born in 
Sh<.lngh<.li. hin <.l in 1937, and

the utiona l Science FoundaÂ· 
tion si nce 1977. He is al 'o 
President of the Chi cago 
c hu pter of the ation u l 
Association of Chinese-
Americans. 

Woo believes Revelle's s tuff 
is "one of the best found 
a nywhe re ... J've <.I lso met about 

20 students (at the collegc) and 
they were vcr. keen ." 

According to Woo. the quality

the sa mc, Howe\,cr, when it 
comes to rescarch , "UCSD is 
stronger thun olthwe tern," 
said Woo. ' 

The atmosphere of the two

''I'm su re the move will be a 
financial dis<.l Â·tcr for me ." he 
laughcd, "becmlse of the dr'op 
in salary and also because 
housing is more expensive in 
southern Ca lifomia."

of the meeting, saying, "It fs 
very difficult to explain things
