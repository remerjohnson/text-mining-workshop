Harris wins in a squeaker,

What's wrong 
with Tuesday? 

They should have just stuck with Tuesday. 
The AS run-off election , originally 

scheduled for Tuesday and then reset for 
Monday, ended up on both day . 

Was it an unusual how of compromise in 
an otherwise dog-eat-dog election? Not 
exactly. 

It seems that the Election Board didn't like 
the date that its code had chosen for the run-
off, Tuesday. Cinco de Mayo was on Tuesday, 
and the run-offs might conflict with the-
holiday, Elections Commissioner Melissa 
Ligman reasoned. 

So to avoid interfering with festivities that 
did not begm until late in the afternoon -
about the same time elections polls would 
have closed - the com iss ion violated its own 
codes and set the big day for Monday. Later 
their decision was upheld by the Judicial 
Board. 

Then someone remem red that the 
tallying ystem, on loan from the San Diego 
County Registrar, wa already re erved 
Monday for the counting of the city's 
convention proposition_ 

The commis ion decided to count the 
ballots themselves, and Monday became the 
official run-off day. 

But it just didn't work out. The polls, 
scheduled to open at 9 am, instead opened at 
noon because of a delay in the printing of 
ballots. 

To maintain its equity standards, the 
commission extended the run-oifs through 
half of Tuesday.

J hua Harris won the A 
presidential election Tue day, but 
wa immediately di qualified for 
what amounted to be a 93-c nt 
campaign overexpenditure. 

Opponent Jules Bagneri , who 
lost in the run-off 766 to 738 (Ies 
than a two percent difference) wa 
named AS president last night by 
the AS council. His term formally 
begin next Wednesday, until 
which time Harri ' disqualifica-
tion sti ll can be appealed. 

Harri s' vice presidential 
running mate Eric Singer, who 
lost to Bagneri ' running mate 
Alma Key (835 to 638), wa al 0 
disqualified. 

ince Tue day' run-off, Harri 
has turned in additional campaign 
receipt totalling $17 over the 
limit. Tue day 's Judicial Board 
di qualified Harris and inger for 
the 93-cent overexpenditure with 
the under tanding that the total 
wa actually higher, accordin~ to 
Elections Commis ioner Meltssa 
Ligman. 

Harri and Singer were cited by 
the Elections Comm! ion for two 
violation of the election code: 
overspending their allotted $50 
limi t by 93¢, and not filing receipt 
and copie of poster with the AS 
before the poster were posted . 

''I'm not plea ed and I don't 
think 760 tudent wi ll be either," 
Harri s sa id yesterday. " I 
understand that if (a candidate) 
goes over by one penny (h has) 

violated an election cod , but it 
wa n't the most prof ion ally run 
el ction." 

The Election Commission 
could not com.e up with a milder 
punishment. The commi ion did , 
in fact, consider two alternative: 
ubtracting vote in proportion to 

the amount over pent, and 
nullifying the election . According 
to commission member David 
B kman, the proportional y tern 
wa con idered too difficult to 
ca lc ulate . Likewi e, the 
commission decided that 
nullifying the run·off was out of 
the que tion. But , "hort of 
removing Harri from the race was 
to do nothing," B kman aid. 

Said Bill Topkis, A pre ident, 
"What went down wa bogu. 
When you work a hard a Jo h 
ha , I find it really diffi ult to 
believe that (theJudicial Board and 
the Election Commis ion) came to 
a deci ion which a bridged t he voice 
of the tudent ." 

Harri s consulted with Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affair 
Richard Armitage yesterday and 
decided to appeal his case to the 
judicial board · 

"It is a matter of opinion 
wheth r it wa absent·mindedne 
or ignoring the election code ," 
commented Bruce Napell , member 
of the Election Commi ion . "In 
either ca e it wa a violation of 
code, and the Election 
Commi sion decided under the 
circumstances that removing him 
from the race was warranted. By

---letters-------------------------------

'Guardian,' 'ni' misrepresented Gavin 
Editor: 

Anyone who had faithfully 
been reading the two campus 
newspapers last week would 
undoubtedly have learned of 
the curious legal circum-
stances surrounding this 
apparently controversial 
character by the name of John 
Gavin_ At the risk of seeming 
naive I am writing this letter 
to the editor because I do not 
understand how these t~o 
newspapers . although 
possessing identical sets of 
detailed data. could reach 
uch diametrically opposed 

conclusions about the subject 
of their stories. On Tuesday. 
the new indicator termed this 
fellow in question an 
" apolitical" and " well -
meaning" individual who 
conducts his life "in a 
responsible manner; " but. on 
Thursday. in a splashy four-
page article by Guardwn 
editor Kathy Huffer. this 
man is portrayed a being 
beset by romantic "obses-
sion." publicity - eeking 
insecurity. and criminal 
refractorines . Are these two 

newspapers discussing the 
same individual? Are readers 
simply being treated to a 
second-rate campus version 
of a notorious "Jack and 
Shan a" polemic? Who is one 
supposed to believe and, more 
importantly, who really even 
cares one way or the other? 

Firstl}'. my advice is to 
believe neither of these 
tabloids. Any regular reader 
of both the indicator and the 
Guardian has certain ly 
discovered by now that the 
staff of the former is 
infiltrated by rascals while 
the staff of the latter is 
populated by stooges. One 
would no more select a broker 
on the advice of a Robert 
Vesco than he would engage a 
Reverend Jed for contracep-
tive counselin~. Don't expect 
that a univerSIty press is not 
a microcosm of the world at 
large. Rogues and fool are 
alway at bay. 

Secondly, with re peet to 
the que tion of who gives a 
damn anyway, the whole 
issue really does seem to be a 
trivial a a wart of a flea ' 

Why not stop and 
listen to CARP 
Editor: 

I want to say a few words 
about the April 16 CARP 
rally. The one article you 
printed was very negative 
and you wento so far as to call 
CARP dangerous. I was at the 
rally Thursday, and I saw a 
bunch of people doing their 
best to disrupt it; people you 
seem to applaud were viola-
ting CARP s right to speak. 
rreedom of speech isn't 
freedom to drown out 
another with "bullshit" 
yelled at the top of your 
lungs. Freedom of speech is 
freedom for everyone to 
express their ideas without 
interference. 

EI Salvador is an emotional 
issue. America 's involvement 
in it concerns us all. It seems 
that the people against the 
rally condemn American but 
supporl USSR and Cuban 
involvement because they 
(the Russians) are helping to 
tree an oppre sed people. 

That i a wonderful goal , but 
historically, whenever a 
communist " liberation" 
movement has succeeded, a 
chaotic and repressive. ever 
murderous. political situa-
tion has followed. Whether it 
be Stalin's executions and 
forced starvations, Mao' s 
purges (legitimized murder), 
the Berlin wall , Cambodian 
slaughter or Southeast Asia's 
boat people, the record is the 
same - the people who the 
revolution was fought on 
behalf of don't like the 
results. 

It's pretty clear the world 
situation isn't just going to 
peacefully go away and leave 
us alone. So maybe we'd 
better find out what' going 
on and not yell omeonequiet 
just becau e we don't like 
what they're saying -
because what they're saying 
just might be true.

derriere - except for the 
involvement of the campus 
police, of course. In case your 
chief interest in newspapers 
nowadays is clipping coupons 
and lining bird cages, permit 
me to remind you that the 
campus police constitutes 
that illustrious cadre of 
public ervice official who 
have considerable difficulty 
tracking down rapists and 
burglars but not political 
demonstrators and expired 
meters. 

The e same police are 

spending their time and 
manpower on a regular basis 
in an attempt to incarcerate 
an individual who, according 
to even the Guardian, has not 
been convicted of guilt in the 
matter of any allegation and 
who, even at the time of his 
arrest, was merely drinking 
beer with a few friends in 
Argo Hall. 'Certainly, the 
campus police can find more 
productive pursuits than the 
harrassment of a student's 
guests who have been 
accorded by court order the 
right to assemble and 

associate at social events 
planned by their obliging 
hosts. 

If anyone would care to 
terminate this wasteful 
abuse of comm unity 
resources, one solution, 
although not recommended. 
is readily available. Simply 
cal l the police anytime, day or 
night, to report a figure 
lurking in the shadows of 
Argo Hall . Perhaps they'll 
pick up a rapist on the drive 
over. Remember, 4S2-HELP! 

John Gavin 

PLO speaker was well received 
Editor: 

I read the letters to the 
Guardian about Hatem 
Hussaini, the PLO represent-
ative who spoke hereon April 
23, and I was much 
surpri sed_ The letters were 
all negative, yet most of the 
sentiment in the room was 
positive. Several members of 
t he audience - Israelis, 
American, Blacks, Whites, 
people of all descriptions -
poke to tell Hussaini they 

were with him . They 
supported his cause. 

Hus aini's po ition wa 
simp le without bei ng 
simplistic. He defined the 
Israel-Palestine question as a 
land question , and the goal of 
the PLO as the return of 
Palestinians to their homes. 

During the question and 
answer period he was asked 
to explain the PLO's use of 
violence. He cited a UN 
resolution supporting the 
right of people to use arms in 
struggl es for national 
liberation. and described the 
Palestinians as people 
expelled from their homes 
with the right to return to 
them. That seem like a 
struggle for national 
liberation to me. 

Hus~niwuaskedwh~ 
would replace the status quo 
in the Middle East. He 
answered that the PLO 
supported a single, democrat-
ic secular state, but that a 
two- tate olution would also 
be acceptable. He spoke about 
the need for negotiation and 
de cribed PLO efforts to 
brin8 negotiations about. He 
dechned to predict what 
compromise would actually 
be reached n the ground 
that "that's what negotia-
tion are for." Hi answer 
se med , a exten ive as 

anyone but a prophet could 
supply. 

Hussaini dealt with a few 
issues on a humorous basis. 
Asked why Palestinians were 
not absorbed by the rest of 
the Arab world he compared 
by hypothetical possibility of 
Californian being absorbed 
by the rest of the US . The 
subject of biblical claims to 
the land was dismissed with 
Hussaini's inability to believe 
that God is a real estate 
agent. 

All in all I found that when 
Hussaini took a position it 
was defendable, and that he 
answered questions well. I 
was favorably impressed by 
him. 

f wish I could have the 
same respect for the cali ber of 
the audience. Throughout 
the evening. UCSD students 
who I knew and recognized 
asked the most irrelevant 
questions about Jews as a 
nationality, and why not 
send the Palestinians to 
Jordan; I was a lit tle 
embarrassed. 

As a Jew I found Hussaini's 
position perfectly acceptable. 
He went out of his way to say 
that there is no necessity for 
Jews to leave, only for 
Palestinians to return . 
That's good enough for me. 
After all, the Pa sover service 
say next year in Jerusalem, 
not next year own Jeru alem. 
And we are specifically 
commanded to welcome the 
stranger among us and to 
remem ber t hat we were once 

' strangers to Egypt. Even the 
most religious should be 
atisfied by that argument. 
For tho e of us who are not 

religiou , the PLO position 
eem more than fair . Maybe 

I can't peak for everyone, 
but I knQw that most of the 

audience applauded very 
enthusiastically when 
Hussaini finished . 

So please set the record 
straight. In spite of last 
Thursday's letters, Hussaini 
was very well received.

Sexuality 
in turmoil 
Editor: 

I'm concerned . What ha 
become of freeing our elves 
from the inhibitive sexual 
attitudes of former genera-
tions? It appears to me that 
two main problems we live 
with are: 1) our perpetuated 
sex-role stereotyping and 
conditioning of what a 
woman and a man should be, 
taught to us by parents, 
schools, media and employ-
ment, and 2) lack of open and 
honest communication about 

exua lity among lovers, 
friends, family, students and 
educators, media and others. 

The amount of misinfor-
mation, misunderstanding 
and neglect we maintain on 
'exual issues is a toundin~. 
Sexual gratification IS 
per hap one of the most 
common desires women and 
men share; yet it 's discus ed 
with the least ease and 
honesty. 

The women' movement 
opened our eyes not only to 
the oppre sion of women but 
also to the oppression of men . 
I n 't it time that we see our 
mutual oppression and 
interdependence on each 
other and join forces to free 
our elves? Or i it not the

-Editorial-----------

No respect 
Jo hua Harris defeated 

Jule Bagneri for the AS 
pre 'idency Tue day, but a 
combination of insensi-
tive ill-con idered and just 
plain stupid rulings by the 
Elections Commission and 
its Judicial Board seem to 
have robbed students of 
their duly elected presi-
dent . 

There are two different 
i ues involved: first, the 
commis ion voted on 
Tuesday to un eat Harris 
because he spent over his 
limit by 93 cents. 93 cent ! 
Are these people serious? 
The arrogance of both the 
commission and the 
Judicial Board is almost 
palpable. 

The commission char-
ged Harris with turningin 
receipt late, but most AS 
candidates did that and 
suffered no penalty. 

Then Harri s came 
before the commission 
yesterday, volunteering 
the information that he 
over-spent by $4 because 
of a misplaced receipt. 
Clearly, Harris, who says 
his campaign finances 
were bungled by the 
absenl:e of his campaign 
manager, is sincere in his 

tatement that the very 
minor over·spending \Va 
accidental. 

The elections commi -
ion , chaired by Melis 'a 

Ligman , and the Judicial 
Board , chaired by former 
si lly AS President Jeremy 
Charlton, have further 
destroyed the integrity of 
the AS . 

If Bagneri takes office, 
it i unlikey that his 
administration, pro peets 
for which are made 
difficult by institutional, 
raci m at UCSD, wi ll be 
made any ea ier by a belief 
that he i an " illegitimate" 
president. 

If Harris succeeds in 
getting the ruling over· 
turned, he willI ) start his 
administration on a bitter, 
antagonistic note and 2) 
set another in a long series 
of precedents for interven-
tion in AS elections. 

Neither candidate will 
get the chance to re tore 
the '"re peet" they argued 
was so important to the 
student body. 

The Elections Commis-
sion and the Judicial 
Board have done a real 
di sservice to UCSD

But are gimmicks uch a 
cut glass or a ide of beef the 
way to attract young car-
buyers? Hardly. 

Recent market surveys 
indicate that , on the whole, 
young people would prefer a 
car loaded with performance 
and comfort opt ions, but turn 
more cost-conscious when 
facing a minimum $6,000 or 
$7,000 investment. 

General Motors spoke -
man Harold Jackson told our 
reporter Michael Duffy that 
young people want car with 
low fuel and insurance costs. 
Dealers report they're 
ordering scaled-down cars Lo 
meet these needs. 

Unfortunately, car aren't 
getting any cheaper. While 
Ford and Chry ler have 
promised to hold prices down, 
GM ha n't done itself any 
favors by raising sticker 
prices almost $400 last 
month. The average GM 
model, according to Automo-
tive News, ells for over 
$10,000. 

What are car-buyers 

getting in return for higher 
prices? Not added safety. Last 
week, GM announced a halt 
in it air bag program. It said 
it will encourage the federal 
guvernment to lift require-
ment for "pa ive re-
s traint .. in future car 
mnrlel . Meanwhile, foreign 
automakers are proceeding 
as planned with air bags on 
1983 models. 

Nor do Americans believe 
they're getting a turdier car 
from Detroit, a cording to a 
recent New York Times poll. 
Reports of imperfections in 
what the automakers call " fit 
and finish " - for example, 
how a door or molding fits to 
the c'ar body - have 
increa ed among car owner 
recently. Even GM admitted 
last month that it X-cars

Quality standard . 

Young car-buyers are being

high-priced cars.

points of my letter of support 
for Josh Harris as ASUCSD

am not the Chair of the 
Studenr Center Board. I am 
the AS rep to the Board. 
Second , my endorsement of

Harris wins, but

continued from page I 
disqualifying Massara, the 
Election s Commi ss ion 
suspended him from a day of 
campaigning. 

Harris i skeptical that, if 
he decide to fu r ther appeal 
his case, the Judicial Board 
will be less strict now that 
additional receipts have been 
submitted . 

Any additional appeals 
w ould be heard by the 
Judicial Board. T he board 
voted 3·2 Tuesday to 
disqualify Harri and inger, 
with Chairman Jeremy 
Charlton pIa ing the deciding 
vote. 

A ked Charlton, "What 
kind of puni 'hment could 
Josh have been given once the 
polls were closed?" 

T he admini trat ion has 
refused to become involved 
wi th the election disputes. 
Bot h Armitage and AS 
Advi or Randy Woodard said 
they wi ll provide Harris only 
wi th consultation . 

After t he Judicia l Board 
announced its support of the 
E lection Commission 's 
decision late Tue day, Harris 
immediately d isputed the 
overexpe nditure charge, 
claiming he was charged for 
330 flyers which he never 
used. 

But Ligm ann said she " told 
him (las t Wednesday) that 
th e co mm iss i o n co uld 
reassess thecost ofthe fl yers, 
bu t he never brought them 
in. " 

Campai~ protocol calls for 
each candIdate to submit to 
the AS office a form for 
a pproval, all receipts and two 
copies of the fl yer. 

T here wa no indication 
that Bagneris played a ro le in 
the violat ion s charges 
against Harri s and Singer, 
which were filed by A 
Commiss ioner of Welfare 
Reggie Williams. 

Bagneri s said he wa 
"totally independent" from 
the decis ion to file the last· 
minute campaign charges. 
"I'd rather it not have 
happened that way," he said . 

Alma Key, running mat of 
Bagneris . who won over 

inger, aid s he wa . "looking 
forward to a hard year's 
work" and noted that "thcr 
will definitely be orne 
chang s in next year' A ." 

Key agr e s with the 
Election Commis ion 's 
deci ion to di qualify Harri '. 
"This wa the run ·off 
election. Everyone should 
know the rules by now," Key 
commented.

State Legislature swamped with bills 
Anti-tuition bill among only a handful that affect UC students 

BY RICK DOWER 
s.crameato eorre poadeDI 

SACRAMENTO - The State Legislature hit 
its most frantic stride so far last week. with 
swamped committees in both houses considering 
testimony on hundreds of bills, a handful of which 
directly affect coIlege students. 

Legislation to eliminate unemployment benefits 
for students, prevent fraternity hazing, crack down 
on the state Student Aid Commission, set aside land 
for low-income student housing and provide for 
correction of inaccurate student records was all 
heard last week, with mixed results. 

Assem bly mem bers and Senators were 
scrambling to beat the May 1 deadline for all biIls 
with a fiscal impact to be heard in committee in 
order to be considered for pa age this year. 

AIl non-financial biIls have until May 22 to be 
considered at the committee level. There, most of 
the real legislative work takes place as witnesses 
testify in favor of or against bills and lawmakers are 
forced to defend their mea ures. 

Some committee hearings last week lasted 10 or 
12 hours and ran far into the night and even early 
morning_ Tempers of legislators ometimes grew 
short as they attempted to juggle hearing or hustle 
from committee to committee to push their own 
bills through_ 

The University of California was the direct target 
of two major bills that would drastically limit the 
UC Regents' power to set tuition at the University 
by granting a legi lative veto. The measures, one in 
the Senate and one in the Assembly, were strongly 
endorsed in their respective committees. 

Another far-reaching proposal to prohibit 
unmarried minors under age 18 from having an 
abortion without written parental consent or a 

court order also was approved in committee. 
Following are some of the other bills most 

effecting college tudents that cleared their first 
legislative hurdle last week. All the measures -
especially the tuition biIls and abortion proposal-
till have a long, possibly rocky road to go in both 

houses before they can finally be enacted into law. 
Benefits - Assemblyman Richard Robinson's 

plan to stop coIlege students from collecting 
unemployment benefits if they can 't accept full-
time work won strong support from an Assembly 
committee. 

The mea ure by the Garden Grove Democrat 
would overturn a recent state Supreme Court 
decision holding that a student need only look for 
part-time work while in ch I and still be able to 
collect payment . 

Cal Grants - The Senate Education Committee 
swiftly approved a bill by Alan Sieroty (D-LA), that 
would empower the Legislature to review and veto 
the state Student Aid Commis ion (SAC) in the 
matter of setting the income ceiling for financial aid 
recipients. 

The legi lation, . imilar to a bill also up for 
consideration by an Assembly committee authored 
by Santa Barbara's Gary Han, grew out of a recent 
flap when the SAC quietly raised the income ceiling 
from $33,000 to $40,000 for Cal Grant A recipients . 
The move, condemned by one lawmaker as "an 
elitist rip-off." threatened to bump hundred of 
lower-income and minority students who would 
have gotten grant . Under fire, the commission 
modified it tance and has since adopted a sliding-
scale income ceiling. 

Hazing - Lawmakers on the A sembly Criminal 
Justice Committee unanimously backed a measure 
to stiffen the maximum penalty for anyone found 

guilty of hazi ng during fraternity initiation rites. 
The bill , AB 1265 by Jim Cramer (D-C hico), 

increases the penalty for hazing to a $5,000 fine, a 
year in jailor both and require all public colleges 
and univer itie to adopt rules to implement the law 
and make it public. 

According to the California State tudents 
Association, which spon ored the bill . nine people 
have died from hazing nationwide in the last two 
years. 

Records - A proposed law to set up procedures for 
college students to purge their academic records of 
incorrect information such as wrong grades and 
seek impartial review oft he records died in a Senate 
committee when committee members deadlocked. 

The bill. introduced by Sen Bill Greene, (D-LA), 
revolved around the ongoing case of former UC 
student Donald Parks, who alleges he was kicked 
out of UC Davis Medica l School on the basis of 
incorrect academic records. UC official say they 
cannot comment on the case, which has recently 
been reopened by the US Office of Civil Rights. 

Current law does not require an educational 
institution to correct any errors in a tudent' 
record, only to allow the student to pre ent evidence 
of the errors. 

Housing - An As embly committee endor ed a 
measure to ask the UC Regents to determine 
whether housing is needed for low-income students 
before any surplus university land is sold . The bill , 
AB 1480 by San Diego Democrat Larry Kapiloff , 
would effectively prevent the sale of university land 
if there is a shortage of low· income housing on or 
around a campus and freeze the land for housing 
purposes. The measure would only take effect if the 
Regents adopt a re olution supporting the idea_

Sexual 
turmoil 
case that we're all oppressed? 

For a while I entertained 
thoughts of a men's center on 
campus, but that would only 

~erve to segregat e not 
mtegrate men and women. [ 
think it's long overdue that 
we get a healthy grasp on the 
sexual ituation together. 
Along with Sisterhood and 
Brotherhood it's time we 
begin internalizing such 
concepts as Peoplehood (or 
Siblinghood). 

What are your feelings and

....-- A.S. Socks It 
To The Guardian 

"Many have known the thrill of victory, and still more have known the agony of 
defeat." Truer words have never been spoken as in the case of the A.S Council 'IS, 
The Guardian staff. On Sat. April 25 the A.S. Council defeated the Guardian staff in 
a challenge match baseball game by a score of 19-7, Not to be outdone, the 
Guardian challenged the AS. to a rematch where they were resoundingly 
defeated apln. A soccer challenge wa~ then given by the Guardian and they 
looked towards Sat. Mlr<I 2 with hope. 

Saturday, Miry 2, proved to be equally dismal for the Guardian when, by a score 
of 4-1 they were defeated in soccer by the AS. Council. It should be roted that 
the only point scored by the Guardian was by AS, Council member Reggie 
Williams who joined their ranks because of a person shortage. 

We, of the AS Council say to you, the Guardian staff "How does it feel to get 
your As- whupped twice." Perhaps your expertise lies in other areas such as 
solving cross word puzzles or deciphering anagrams, It definitely is not in 
baseball or soccer, 

By a unanimous vote, we of the AS. Council have decided to let you, the 
Guardian staff win the next game "you" challenge us to. You pick the time, place 
and the game and to insure that you'II win - we won't show up,

Cyclers overcome disasters 
Place third in Western Championships 

BY BLAKE SHAW 
lofl Writer 

Everyone has days where it 
eems they got up on the 

wrong side of bed . The UCSD 
Cycling Team had one of 
those weekends, yet still 
managed to place third out of 

I twelve teams competing for 
the Western Intercollegiate 
Championships last weekend 
at Stanford. 

In the course of the 
weekend , three bicycles were 
stolen, illness sidelined two 
riders and crashes eliminated 
three UCSD riders from 
competition. sending two of 
them to the ho pital and 
ruining the frame of one 
bicycle. 

The Championship were 
divided up into four events . 
Saturday morning there 
were individual 10 mile time· 
trials for the novices and the 
women, and a 20 mile four · 
man team time trial which 
each team cou ld enter. In the 
afternoon road races were 
held on a hilly, windy and 
grueling 28 mile course 
which formed a loop through 

otherwi e beautifully scenic 
countryside southeast of 
Half-Moon Bay . Sunday 
morning' criterium (which 
are similar to Gran Prix auto 
race ), were held on the 
Stanford campus, in which 
riders circled around a .75 
mile course. whid' include 
ix 90 degree turns. 
The outstanding UCSD 

performance in the time 
trials wa achieved by Tim 
Rodden, who came in first 
place out of 60 rider with a 
time of 23:46 for the windy 
ten mile course, 22 seconds 
faster than his nearest rival. 

In the women's 10 mile 
time trials, Gina Fleming 
rode the fastest for UCSD. 
placing sixth among the 25 
competitors with a time of 
28:03, 1:19 behind the fir t 
place fini her. 

The men' team time trial 
squad suffered from its lack 
of experience riding together, 
finishing seventh. The squad 
had to be reorganized last 
week when Paul Vine, coach 
and enior member of the 

ITT quad , came down with 
ache t infection, 

]n the 28 mile novice road 
race , Tim Rodden launched a 
010 breakaway wit h five 

miles remaining in the race. 
With the help of teammate 
Greg Schermann trying to 
keep the pace of the eight 
man chase group low , 
Rodden's breakaway wa 
uccessful , winning the race 

handily. Schermann finished 
third in the race out of 80 
starters. 

In the women's road race. 
Gina Fleming was the victim 
of a spectacular crash. At the 
l5 mile point of the course. a 
2-mile long hill followed by a 
treachero u , narrow , 
winding downhill stretch, 
with two blind hairpin turns 
caught Fleming' s control. 
Fleming, trying to make up 
for lost time, took one of the 
curves too fast and flew off 
the edge of the road , down a 
steep embankment and intoa 
barbed wire fence. She wa

Innertube waterpolo 
gets everyone wet 

BY VALERI • ANDERS 
Intramural innertube 

waterpolo la t Monday night 
saw the undefeated Foul Play 
take on the two and one 
Floatie . 

With the team po itioned 
at t heir respective ends of the 
pool, referee Dan Crane 
dropped the ball at mid-pool 
and the game was underway. 

Each player splashed and 
kicked their way toward the 
ball, which while ittingin an 
innertube i no easy feat. 

Each person being chased 
and even dumped from their 
tubes by oppo ing players, 
the ball was flying through-
out the game from end to end. 

At the end of the game it 
was 22·3 in favor of Foul Play. 

Although every player on 
Foul Play i experienced, 
most playing five year or 

more, it was Ed Martinez 
who did mo t of the et ups or 
scoring. At 6'4" Martinez 
require a pecial large 
innertube. and is able to 
manipulate the ball like a 
tenni ball because of his 

lara~e hands. 
Barbara Baitel, also of Foul 

Play, scored numerous goals 
and prevented the Floaties 
from scoring many times 
with her agresive pur uit. 

In game number two Sklif 
got by the Tu be Sharks 13-12. 

In the third game Destiny 
easily beat the Scremen 
Seamen ]8-0. 

Thi coming weekend, a 
team formed with members 
from Foul Play and De tiny 
will travel to UC Santa 
Barbara to compete in the All· 
Cal Intramural Sports 
Festival. 

Mike Hipp of the Intra-
mural office stated that the 
popularity of innertube 
waterpolo at UCSD allows it 
to be offered more than once 
during the year.

Golfer s 
hole fine 
showing 

BY NANCY LEE 
Stalf Writer 

The UCSD Triton golfer 
did well a a team and 
individually at the NAIA 
Di stric t Champion hip 
Tournament on Monday, 
May 4. Originally scheduled 
at Soboba Spring, the 
tournament was moved to 
Rainbow Canyon Golf 
Co.urse, in Rancho California. 

The Tritons placed third in 
the Dist r ict behind the 
University of Redlands and 
Point Lorna College with a 
fi nishing score of 650. 
R~lands took fi rst place 
With a total of 631. Point 
Lorna pulling a close second 
wit h a score of 643. 

Individual victories for 
UCSO were made by Bruce 
Nakamura, Ian Langdon, and 
Mike O'Brien, w ho placed 
overall in the tournament 
third, eigth and ni nt h 
respectively . Nakamura 
made the first Team AII-
Conference with a score of 
158 for the day, and both 
Langdon and O'Brien made 
econd Team All-Conference 

NAJA, with total scores of 162 
and 163 respectively. 

The five school in the 
District played two rounds of 
golf for a total of 36 holes. 
T he first round was in the 
morning, followed by lunch, 
and then another round in 
t he afternoon. 

After the fi rst round of golf, 
UCSD was in second place, 
only four shots be hind 
Redlands and four shots in 
front of Point Lorna. 

During lunch the perfect 
playing co ndi tions were 
swept away by 30 mph 
winds. Only two people in 
the tournament were able to 
break 80 on the 72 par course. 

Redlands increased its lead 
in t he afternoon, and Point 
Lorna overtook UCSD, to 
occupy the econd rung in the 
tourney's ladder. 

UCSO's fi fth man on the 
six man team failed to make 
the tournamen t due to a 
couple of midterm exams 
scheduled for the same day. 

Triton Golf Coach Mike 
Wydra commented , "Had we 
been able to have our fi ft h 
man here with us, we would 
hav e c hallenged both 
Redlands and Point Loma for 
the first olace."

Film/Mike Thomas 

Slamming 'Heaven's Gate' 
Two editors sit in an 

editing room in Hollfwood. 
"OK . what's next." 
"Heaven's Gate, the hort 

ver ion" - dialogue from 
Albert Brooks' A Modem 
Romance 

Well here it is at la 1. 
Michael Cimino's equivalent 
of the Tilanic, Heaven's Gal. 
Even people who don't know 
Ingrid Bergman from Ingmar 
have heard about thi four 
hour $40 million fiasco that 
wa withdrawn after only a 
week' run in New York and 
then ent back for . alvaging 

in the editing room. Well, 
United Artists obviou ly 
haven't much fait h in the 
movie, and it has been 
unceremoniously dumped on 
the market place with 
virtually no hope of 
recouping its investment. I 
it really that bad? No. not 
quite. 

There are actually quite a 
number of thing to like 
about Heaven's Gate. The 
photography, by the great 
Nestor Alemendros, is 
nothing short of sublime. 
The opening equence at 
Harvard (actually shot at 
OX\0rd) is fi lmed through a 

mi~ of rust tinted diffu ion 

fi lt.er and gives the 
commencement and dance 
cene an air of lost dream· 

like innocence. The musical 
core by David Man field 

(formerly of Bob Dylan" 
backup band ) i richly 
evocative. and t he entire 
production, from a technical 
point of view, is f1awle . So 
what happened? 

Cimino was so obsessed 
with recreating detail and 
ambience that he forgot to 
put a story up there on the 
screen . Atmosphere i great 
when it' part of a well· 
constructed narrative, but it 
can't function in place of 
u h crucial elements as a 

well·crafted script, decent 
acting and a well-thought 
de 'ign about thedirection the 
film should take. Cimino wa 
obviously tryi ng for a grand 
slam wit h thi movie. It reek 
of .an attempt at epic making 
cinema, but in his grandio e 
scheme to make the Great 
American Movie, Cimino 
reveals him elf to be a 
superior technician, but a 
minor talent. 

And clearly this is hi ' 
movie, he wrote the cript as 
well as directed and his name 
is featured more prominently 
than any of the actors, indeed 
it's almost a big as the title 
of the film it elf. Had he 
allowed someone to come in 
and ?Olish his script he 
might ve actually pulled off 
the whole enterprise.

bCIIIIbun People moy normally 

associMe the sword Excalibur and 
Camelot with King Arthur and Lancelot 
(a, perhaps, with Rich¥d Burton). Bu~ 
after they see thiS movie, they should 
automatically think of Merlin, the 
magICian ard pc:M'er behird the throne. 
Nicol Williamson, as Merlin, IS the touch 
that aUCMIS John Boorman's film to rise 
abc:Ne the crowd. Sure, t~ special 
effects are nice, the battles realistic, the 
men hardsome ard vallOnt, the women 
beautiful - in other words, the 
Arthurlan legend brought forth 
accurately - bu~ Without Merlin, th is 
wouldn't be a potential classic. The 
sure test IS In the latter stages of the 
story, .....nen Merlin IS missing from the 
scene. Thires really slow at that point. 

Bu~ thanlcs to Williamson's Merlin, .....no 
is at turns mystical, fnghtening ard 
vulnerable, thiS IS a definite "don't 
miss" fT1OVIe. 

H.oId Ind M8udc: The key here, 
you have to remember, IS that Harold 
lo.-es Maude. And Maude ICllles H/II'old 
What you can't forget, though, IS that 
Maude IS pushire 00 and HarOld IS a 
schoolboy. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon 
play the most IntfigUire pair o f lo.-ers In 
some time and their relationship serves 
as the centerpiece for thiS utterly off, 
thewall story. The other subjects are. 
SUICide, aging, peace and war, though 
nO( necessari ly In that order If you 
haven't seen thiS yet, It'S your tough 
luck. If you have seen It, you should see 
it again. 

Suy Aa You Arc: Marcelle 
Mastroiaml IS a mlddle'aged man and 
Nastassia Klnski a teenage girl In thiS 
story of ICIIIe, dreams and lost romance. 
Mastroianni meets KlnskJ In a ga-den 
ard soon falls in k:Ne with her - he 
sees lost youth, ard an old girt friend, In 
her; she is In se/ll'ch of a father figure to 
replace the father she nevcr knew. 
EIo'tntually, MastrOIanni dlsco.-ers he 
mlgrt be her fllttler Out of thiS tension 
comes a bltte~et, erotiC, wonderful 
mCNie. As a~, MastrOianni IS solid 
and deep KIOSkI, on the other hard, IS 
at turns dingy, sexy ard melancholy -
and always fetchingly beautiful. 

T_: Ni!Stassia Kinski, as Tess of the 
DUrbelvilles, IS a woman .....no any 
decent man would gNe his soul fa. 
With dark, expressNe eyes ard full 
mouth, she is the soul of thiS mCMe, the 
reason It ultimately succeeds. Of 
course, Roman PolanSki - in a radical 
depaltlle from hiS usual type of movie 
- does a fine job in bringire the 
Thomas Hardy no.-el of lo.-e and 
Itfpoc"sy to the screen. The rank 
InjUStice of late 19th century Englond 
blend well with the beautiful, enduring 
countryside But if Kinski dldn't exiSt, 
Polanski would have had to Irt.'ent her. If 
the actress piaylre Tess Isn't someone 
the audience can care for, no one 
would Sit through this three-hour 
retelling of her traY/Ills at the hands of 
lustful, heartless men ard an uncaring 
society. By all means see th is, the best 
mCMe of 1980. 

0rdInIry People: Robert Redford 
did a masterful Job in puttlre together 
this film adaptation of the best-selling 
no.-el about hard times m subUrtlla. 
Mary Tyler Moo'e, a sweetheart in TV 
land for SO long, plays the bltc hy 
mother In a f4lT1i1y that starts to 
disinte!lllte following the drownire 
death (j a fCMll'lte son. Donald 
Sutherland IS her sympathetiC husband, 
trying to hold the family together. 80th 
are good, but Timothy Hutton, as the 
younger son.....no blames himself for hiS

Now you haVe to teU your rooDlmates. 

You've been trying to get to ~ow her better since 
the beginning of the tenn. And when she mentioned how 
hard it is to study in the donn, you said, 
"My place is nice and quiet Come on 
over and study with me:' 

Your roonunates weren't very 
happy about it. But after a little 
persuading they decided the double 
fea~ure at the Bijou might be worth 
seemg. 

They're pretty special friends. 
And they deserve a special "Thanks:'
