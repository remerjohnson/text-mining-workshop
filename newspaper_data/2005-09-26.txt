From the recent ladies of disaster - Hurricanes IUtrina, Ophelia and Rita 
along the Gulf Coast - to the 
monstrous tsunami in the Indian 

Ocean, Mother Nature is assum-
ing an active role. Mudslides, 
wildfires and earthquakes have 
swept Cajifornia lands while 
ominous questions buzz in our 
minds: Are climate change and 
natural disasters related? Is 
human society beginning to see 
repercussions of its use of the 

uc allows file-sharing 
services to court schools 

By CHRISTINE CLARK 
Senior Staff Writer 

I n an effort to curb illegal 
file sharing, the Universily of 
California agreed this month to 
permit apster and other online 
music vendors to offer univer-
sity-based services on its cam-
puses. 

Although CSD is curre ntl y 
not in negotiations with Napster, 
administrators are in the final 
stages of approving a deal with 
another legal Internet music pro-
vider for fall 2005, according to 
Academic Computing Services 
Director Tony Wood . 

"I he university system wrote 
letters to seve ra l on lin e music 
retai lers such as apster, asking 
for a legal tile-sharing service 
to curtail illega l music down-
load ing on ca mpus, and received 
responses from four of them, 
Wood sa id . 

Among the four vendors were 
apster and Cdigix, but UCSD 

is only considering the Cdigix 
offer at this time, according to 
Wood. 

"We are negotiating with 
Cdigix, and that should be se t 
up by the end of fall quarter,"

Appliance vendor, A.S. 
share complex history 
Student government recejve benefits 

as part of contract with Micro 101 
By VLADIMIR KOGAN 

Senior Staff Writer 

For sel eral hundred ,tudents 
living at CS D, renting a refrig-
erator and microwave on cam-
pus - and having the a ppliance~ 
hrought to their room - is a con-
venience roo good to pass up. Each 
year, the students find help from 
the university 's student govern-
ment, which runs just such a pro-
gram, and their elected officials, 
who staffed tables thi .. move-in day 
promoting the service. 

In add ition to a commission 
from the ren ta I service offered by 
Micro 101 Solution, the company 

• that worb in partner~hip w.ith the 
A . . enterprises office, the .5. 
Council receives additional perks, 
which are shared by both the coun-
ci l and other university depart-
ments. This past move-i n day, the 
compa ny also paid $10 per hour 
to the A.S . student officials who 
staffed the tables and were respon-
sible for marketing the equipment 
to resideI1ls, according to informa-
tion obta ined by the Clllmliflll. 

Earlier thi s summer, Sixth 
Col lege Senior Senator Slatt 
Corra les raised some doubts ahout 
the Micro 10 1 partnership, ques-
lioning whether it provided the 
best deal for students, according 
to information acquired hy the 
GllfWe/il/lI. In particular, Corrales 
wondered whether the A.S. 
Council generated adequate prof-
its in the transactions, and whether 
the prices paid by students renting 
the app li ances were reasonable. lI e 
wondered if students would he hel-
te r off si mpl purchasing lheir own 
refrigerators or microwave~. 

In a response lO Corra les ' 
concerns, A.S. Commissioner of 
Enterprise Operations ngela 
Chen defended tile arrangement 
as a very good deal for all those 
involved . As part of the arrange-
ment, Associated Students receives 
$25 for every unit rented, with the

Sound historian 

earns 6lenius' award 
Last week, the John D. and 

Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation 
bestowed the title of 2005 
MacArthur Fellow - dubbed the 
'genius" grant - upon UCSD 
audio historian Emily Thompson. 
As reward, Thompson will receive 
$500/000 in funding over the next 
five years. 

The grant was based on 
Thompson/s research on the his-
torical landscape of American 
sound. Thompson has published 
a book, "The Soundscape of 
Modernity/ ' which explores the 
history of sound technology, sci-
ence and production from the 
turn of the century to the opening 
of Radio City Music Hall in 1933. 
The grant will fund Thompson's 
current project, a book analY1ing 
the evolution from silent to mod-
ern films. 

Admissions administrators said 
that final enrollment figures will 
most likely show that the number 
of Asian and white students on 
campus will be nearly the samet 
according to the onhne publica-
tion 'Insiae Higher Ed". This year's 
freshman class has a white enroll-
ment of 31 percent, Latino enroll-
ment of 11 percent and black 
enrollment of 3 percent. 

A significant contribution to 
large Asian percentage is the envi-
ronment of Berkeley, which has a 
large Asian population, Associate 
Vice Chancellor for Admissions 
Richard Black told the publication. 

'Inside Higher Ed" also report-
ed that Berkeley is accepting Asian 
applicants at a higher rate than 
ever before, while Asian students 
are choosing Berkeley as their col-
lege of choice more often . 

Of all Asian applicants accepted 
to the university, 49 percent chose 
to attend Berkeley, as compared to 
only 43 percent of students gener-
ally, Black stated.

The Office of Stud.ent Research 
at UC Berkeley has reported that 
the school enrolled approximately 
48 percent native Asian, Asian-
American and PaCific Islander stu-
dents in its freshman class, an 
ali-time high for the school where 
Asians made up more than 40 
percent of the student body last 
year. 

Even with the growing num-
bers, the data show a somber 
picture, where American Indians 
between 18 and 24 years of age 
rank much lower than the national 
average in college enrollment.

to the students. Any money ResLife 
gets is given to ICRA, the Inter-
College Residents' Association and 
is used for programming for resi-
dent students." 

However, ICRA President Meg 
Gullo said she was unaware that 
her organization, which puts on 
programs for campus residents, 
received any share of the revenue 
from the deal. 

"I know absolutely nothing 
about it," Gullo ' said. "[ would 
assume if we did, I would know 
something about it." 

Under the current funding 
scheme, Housing and Dining 
Services allocates 52 to ICRA for 
every student living on campus, 
according to Gullo. In addition, 
the organization's nearly S28,OOO 
budget includes 510,000 for travel 
expenses, an amount Gullo said 
she believes is a gift from HDS. 

Both the general allocation 
and the travel funding are exactly 
the same as those included in the 
ICRA budget last year, and nei-
ther appears to be contingent on 
the number of refrigerator and 
microwave units rented. In addi-
tion, the organization's constitu-
tion provides that "ICRA is fund-
ed through an annual monetary 
allocation from UCSD Housing 
and Dining Services, based upon 
the number of undergraduate resi-
dents living on campus," making 
no mention of the Micro 101 pro-
ceeds. 

Chen sent her wrinen response 
after close of business on Sept. 23, 
after most university staff had left. 
Neither HDS Director Mark P. 
Cunningham nor any of the resi-
dent deans at UCSD's six colleges 
responded to e-mail inquires over 
the weekend, which asked about 
the ResLife portion of the profits. 

But even the share of profits 

retained by Associated Students 
is bener than what students were 
getting out of the deal just sev-
enl years ago, according to Jeremy 
Cogan, a 2005 Joim Muir CoUege 
alumnus who served as A.S. com-
missioner of enterprise operations 
in 2003-04. 

That year. the council set up a 
sepante office to manage its prof-
it-making ventures. Previously, 
the same department that oversees 
AS services, like Student-Run 
Television and A.S. Sa~ Rides, 
ran the enterprises. 

"They wen so overburdened 
with dealing with the co-ops and 
Triton Tui and aU of those ser-
vices that Micro 101 was basically 
overlooked, .. Cogan said, referring 
to the days when a single commis-
sioner oversaw both types of A.S. 
opentions. 

At the time, the Safe Rides 
service was called Triton Tui; its 
chronic budget-busting cost over-
runs have proven to be a headache 
for A.S, services commissioners in 
recent years. 

Prior to his arrival, students 
were not seeing a single dime of 
the Micro 101 profits, Cogan said. 

"Before I came in, it was sort 
of managed by the st2ff of A.S., .. 
he said, explaining that the profits 
were redirected to pay for special 
staff training of career university 
employees - including those not 
officially affiliated with the student 
government and not on the A.S. 
Council's payroU. 

At the time, the university had 
already contracted with Micro 
101 for several years, Cogan said. 
Though he said his staff had con-
sidered seeking alternate proposals 
from approomately sill other com-
panies providing similar services, 
the plan never came to fruition 
before he left office. During his 
term, Cogan had instead worlced 

to upand the enterprise office, 
completing a joint ropes course 
with the university's recreation 
department and starting a short-
lived partnership with HDS, which 
allowed students to use their "din-
ing dollars" at Grove Cafre. 

Since then, much of the focus 
has been on the poor-perform-
ing A.S. Lecture Notes and Soft 
Reserves, with the job of reform-
ing the two enterprises charged to 
an awkwardly named Associated 
Students of UCSD Ad Hoc Task 
Force on Assessing the Common

"It really would not be difficult 
for A.S. to put together a com-
parison of different vendors and 
decide one that is cheapest and has 
the best service, " Cogan said of the 
current Micro 101 enterprise. 

That is exactly what was done 
this yeu, according to Chen , 
though she said only two compa-
nies participated in the bidding, 
because the others "were unable 
to accommodate our requests." 
However, she said the name of 

the other company was confiden-
tial and could not be released, 
because it was not selected as 
the service provider. Micro 101 
was again chosen as the vendor 
becaUse it offered a lower cost, 
Chen explained, though she would 
not say how much lower. 

Chen also would not release the 
names of councilmembers who, in 
addition to ResLife staff, were on 
the conuninee that chose Micro 
10 1, though she said none were 
among those on Micro \01 's pay-
roll on move-in day. 

Under UCSD's official con-
flict-of-interest guidelines, "it is 
university policy to separate an 
employee's university and private 
interests and to safeguard the uni-
versity and its employees against 
charges of favoritism in the pur-
chase of goods and services." 

Though the policies were 
developed with career employees 
in mind, they apply in principle to 
student employees as well, accord-
ing to the university's purchasing 
manager Linda Collins. Collins 
forwarded specific questions about 
the Micro \0 I deal to the universi-
ty's manager of business contracts 
Diane Wynshaw-Boris, who was 
unable to respond by press time. 

However, the university'S poli-
cies appear to only scrutinize busi-
ness transactions that involve com-
panies that are at least 10 percent 
owned by university workers, not 
those that simply share overlap-
ping employees. It's also unclear 
whether the conflict-of-interest 
policies would even apply to the 
Micro 101 agreement, since the 
company provides its services to 
students, not to the university, 
and simply gives the council and 
ResLife a commission. 

Chen said councilmembers' paid 
role in the marketing of the service 
does not raise any red flags. 

"Micro 101 wanted A.S. stu-
dents who were familiar with the 
process, and they worked on move-
in day as Micro 101 employees," 
she stated in an e-mail. 

One such employee, though, 
John Muir Collge Sophomore 
Senator John Polkinghorne, said 
he perceived at the time that he 
was acting in his capacity as a 
member of the A.S. Council, not 
as a Micro 101 employee, but one 
simply compensated by the com-
pany for his time. At the time, he 
even wore his official A.S. polo 
shirt. Polkinghorne spoke only 
reluctantly, explaining that he did 
not want malc.e to it seem like he 
was contradicting Chen and that 
his perception was not in any way 
an official one. 

Polkinghorne said he did not 
see anything unethical in the deal , 
since he was simply trying to 
inform srudents of a useful service 
provided by the A.S. enterprises 
office, one they would not have 
learned of had he not been there. 

"Micro 101 asked for A.S. stu-
dents familiar with the processes 
and enterprises of A.S. to help 
out in order to ensure efficiency," 
Chen stated in an e-mail. "Because 
Micro 101 is an A.S. enterprise, 
the A.S. member would have been 
able to answer questions about 
Micro 101 as an A.S. enterprise 
and about A.S. itself. If Micro 101 
had wanted anyone at all to worlc., 
the opporrunity would definitely 
have been open to any student." 

In addition, Chen said that later 
this year, the enterprises office 
would for the first time consider 
whether srudents could get a bet-
ter deal by simply purchasi ng the 
appliances, as Corrales originally 
suggested.

I f your federal finan cial aid lags even further behind you r newly increased college fee 
next year, some of the blame can 
be la id at the feet of Elmo, Charl ie

It all happened this summer,

by 100 million the amount of 
money the government gives 
to the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting, the company that 
passes the bucks to your favorite 
National Public Radio and PBS 
stations. In response, the st.1tions 
aired commercials wa rning of th e 
impending doomsday, urging their

Under its own rules, the House

Private donations can 
help attract leaders 

By HANNA CAMP 
Associate Opinion Editor 

L ast Thursda y, a committee of the UC Regents sent a controversial budget pro-
posal to the full board without a 
recommendation , a testament to 
the difficulty of the issue the bud-
get addressed. 

The proposal suggests solicit-
ing private donations to supple-
ment the salaries of 42 top UC 
executives to bring them up to at 
least $350,000, an amount that 
only eight of the 42 currently 
bring home. Committee members 
commented in frustration that the 
idea was complex, difficult and 
ultimately uncomfortable . 

Adopting this proposal would 
mean significant change in the 
governance of the nation 's top 
public school system, but if top 
UC officials are correct, it's a 
necessary one. Even if they aren't 
telling the whole truth, it is worth 
it for us to consider that when it 
comes to leadership, we may very 
well get what we pay for. 

It's hard for srudenrs to see this 
as a problem that needs attention 
at all , given our own problems 
in fin ancing our educations, and 
considering that these executives 
are already making around or in 
excess of $350,000 a year. At the 
very least, the message that tile 
regent arc so conce rned with 
giving bonuses to chancellors is 
an uninspiring one, while we are 
paying more than we bargained 

for to continue at the university at 
all . But we often forget that this 
university is at its heart a business, 
and the issue of paying top execu-
tives highcr salaries is a business 
interaction, meant to improve the 
quality of leadership. 

A report commissioned by the 
committee found that salaries 
for the top UC executives are 
about 15 percent less than those 
of equivalent positions in the rest 
of the United States. Other public 
university systems in Virginia and 
Texas have already opted to mix 
private and public funds in paying 
their own executives. 

Moreover, UC President 
Robert C. Dynes has insisted that 
the private donations used to sup-
plement salaries would be money 
that wouldn't otherwise go to the 
UC system, because particular 
donors have approached him and 
expressed interest in helping bring 
"leaders" to campuses. Funding 
from the state of California con-
tinues to drop, making the money 
brought in through research and 
private donations even more 
important. 

As always, there are other 
groups who believe that their 
needs are more pressing. The 
chairman of the Academic Senate 
at UC Davis insisted that "our first 
priority for fundraising should be 
graduate srudent support." Union 
officials have argued that the UC 
system should focus on improving

By ROBIN AVERBECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

A s the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina became increasingly clear on our 
televisions, the faces of the report-
ers staring back at us loved asking 
that one pivotal question : Why? 
The question would always lead 
to an awkward discussion about 
God with a visiting religious guest 
often explaining that we musm 't 
blame God, but do what we can to 
reduce human suffering. 

If the media can't pin responsi-
bility on God for the hurricane, you 
best believe they can try to pin the 
outcome on somebody: that some-
body being, most popularly, the 
federal government. Whether it is 
President George W. Bush or the 
Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, Americans - or the media 
that informs them - have an acute 
need to point fingers. They assign 
blame as if the world is a very sim-
ple place where almost any event, 
no matter how complex or diverse, 
can be attributed to a fairly narrow 
set of perpetrators. 

Such reasoning is ridiculous, 
but even more so in a nation 
like ours. For whatever reason, it 
seems that most of the American 
population has forgotten that our 
government is a federalist one; the 
states having been given a certain 
amount of autonomy in the U .S. 
Constitution, there are a series 
of governments with intertwining 
authority, from the federal, to the 
state, all the way down to local city 
governments. 

Everyone seems to like this idea 
just fine - even the most loyal 
lovers of big government want the 
citizens to be able to run the show 
on their own tenns - but we hit a 
rock when it comes to its partner, 
responsibility. Authority implies 
responsibility, yet Americans 
apparently want plenty of the for-

-

mer and none of the latter. If any 
seminational crisis occurs, a million 
cries of negligence, callousness and 
incompetence rise up with fingers 
aLI pointed in one direction: That 
of the federal government. Even 
if the federal government were the 
sole authority, it is still a demo-
cratically elected authority, involv-
ing at least a lninimal amount of 
participation from the masses. But 
politically, the American citizenry 
does not seem to realize this -
they want W to be held account-
able for everything. Yet being able 
to blame everything on the guy at 
the top is a trait of an authoritarian 
regime, not a federalist republic 
such as ours. 

The politics on campus mirror 
this tendency. Listening to fellow 
srudents go on tirades about the 
worthlessness of all individuals in 
srudent government, it appears that 
a simple change of office holders 
would make aLI the world right 
again on campus. And of course, 
when parking fees do not go down, 
when student organizations are not 
blandly inoffensive, and when the 
hot water in the donnitory goes 
out, it is necessary to vote the 
morons out come next election. 
What's that? No one has ever been 
able to really fix these things? Well 
then, the world is full of idiots save 

. you. What a pitiful fate. 
The lesson is not new: If you 

want to complain about how 
something is being done, then 
you best try to show that you can 
do better. Judging from the dismal 
participation in campus politics 
at UCSD, it's fair to say that the 
srudent body has completely for-
gottcn that maxim. Those who 
are politically active can almost be 
split into two groups: one group 
that does, and one group that ridi-
cules what is done. 

Even when there is blame to 
be laid, the alacrity with which 
we go about assigning it is almost

equally as disturbing. Obviously, 
the chaos of Katrina could have 
been prevented or eased if sev-
eral groups and individuals had 
behaved differently. But politics 
finds the honest answer of "human 
error" unacceptable. Mudslingers 
often assume they'll never be wor-
thy of getting hit; apparently they 
themselves have never made a 
mistake, and are omniscient in the 
matter of all things, weather and 
social science included . 

Is it simply that we cannot make 
sense of this world without morons 
and weasels? If you note the rheto-
ric flung around campus during 
election time, people of all sorts are 
not only incompetent, apparently, 
but pernicious as well. There's 
nothing like having someone to 
knock down, and it's horrible to 
have a woe without a perpetrator. 

College srudents in particular 
are awful about this. There is 
a collective ethos among many 
that if only we were in charge of 
things, everything that's wrong 
would be right. 

Truly, how long can one be 
involved in campus life with-
out hearing one of these tirades 
against everyone save the spealeer 
and their group - and how many 
of us have at'll) somewhat embar-
rassingly found ourselves spouting 
the same? 

We rarely loole at things from 
a distance; we never stop and 
notice that there are a million 
threads twisted together to cre-
ate an event, and their relations 
and influences on each other are 
equally tangled . Perhaps it is our 
anger that our problems cannot 
be 50 simply ascribed to a single, 
insidious source that drives us all 
50 mad, and malees us insist on 
the only conclusion we can come 
to with our short vision: Someone 
has done us WTong, and were we 
only in charge, we would not have 
been so mistaken.

ous denial. Both NPR and PBS 
already rely on advertising, includ-
ing ads from tobacco manufactur-
ers and other socially irrespon-
sible multinationals - they just 
call it "underwriting messages." If 
these ads have not already deleteri-
ously injured the quality of pro-
gramming, there is little reason to 
believe that more ads - the likely 
consequences of reduced subsidies 
- would make public broadcasting 
a corporate flunky. 

What public broadcasting pro-

provided even if the government 
stopped subsidizing it, because the 
demand would still be there. Two 
of the most popular current shows 
on public radio, "Marketplace" 
and "This American Life," are 
already distributed by Public Radio 
International, not NPR. Unlike 
NPR, PRJ is a private company, 
and it syndicates its shows not 

only to public radio stations but 
also other content providers, lilee

unaffected by government fund-

its rich viewers and listeners could 

still spring for the satellite pro-
gramming. 

In a perfect world, our society 
would be rational and we would 
not spend one out of every 520 our 
economy produces on the military. 
That way, we could fund social 
services and public broadcasting, 
and still have money left over to 
pay down the national debt. Alas, 
democracy works in strange ways, 
especially when it is driven byemo-
tion and the stupid get a vote. 

Faced with America's continu-
ing problem of having really, really 
filt lcids, "Sesame Street" changed 
one of its signarure tunes earlier 
this year. Instead of his classic "C is 
for Cookie," the Cookie Monster 
now serenades viewers with "A 
Cookie is a Sometimes Food ." 
Maybe funding for public broad-
casting should be too.

Regents: Pay disparity presents hiring problems for UC 
continued from page 4 

the pay and benefits of university 
employees. A past president of 
the UC Faculty Academic Council 
emphasized that the faculty teach-
es and researches , and questioned 
why prominence should be given 
to senior management. 

But it is a mistake to assume 
that there must be better places 
to spend the money, or that top 
executives already have healthy 
salaries is reason enough to move 
on to other things. It's difficult 
to keep good people in any posi -
tion if they could be making more 
money for the same job elsewhere, 
and it' s especially vital to keep 
good people in these jobs. 

UCSD is being paid to do 
things for us, true, but it is also 
involved in competitions for hun -
dreds of millions o f dollars in 
research grants and is a major 
employer and a pivotal member 
of the San Diego economic and 
social community. Running such 
an entity is an extraordinarily dif-
fi cult job, and business entities 
that cannot pay their executives 
competitive salaries will have seri-
ous trouble hiring the best can-
didates. These salary boosts may 
well be what are necded to make 
the U niversity of California more 
competi t ive and more productive , 
which is what will cvenrually ben-
efit us a II. 

There are troubling indications 
that the pay deficit might not 

be so pressing. The same report 
that reported on UC salaries also 
estimated that UC health benefits 
are higher than the average by 
10 percent and retirement medi-
cal benefits are about 63 percent 
higher. Salaries reported by the 
UC system do not include bonus-
es or expense accounts, and the 
IRS figures show that significant 

" These salary boosts may

to make the University of 
California more 

competitive and more 
productive , which is what

us all." 

bonuses have already boosted the 
salary of one of the 42 executives 
well bcyond $350,000. If private 
donations should fall short in a 
f. lture year, what happens? Is it 
trul y private money when public 
fund are spent on the fundrais-
ing?

system has played a major role in 
bringing the best in education to 
lower-income students. Increasing 
ruition makes that a more difficult 
tradition to sustain. 

There is a serious question for 
the regents to consider: Can the 
private donations in question, or 
the effort put into soliciting the 
private donations, better improve 
the starure and productivity of 
the university if invested in the 
executives who run the system, 
or in the system itself? It doesn't 
have to be a choice between one 
or the other, but for the moment, 
the difficulty of finding good lead-
ers for universities suggests that 
recruiting and keeping these lead-
ers is indeed a worthy goal. But 
as new facts come to light and 
new arguments are presented , that 
eva luation could change. 

The proposal will co m e up 
for a vote in N ovember, and it 's 
enco uraging to sce many o f the 
regents comment that it will be 
hotl y debated. Tt needs to be. 
While many question r.he wisdom 
of changing such a long-standing 
policy, others worry that the state 
will use it as a reason to redu ce 
fundin g for the university even 
more. Hopefully, the vote will be 
made based on wh at is best fo r the

Budget: A.S. Safe Rides could receive boost 
continued from page I 

mid-summer and that's when we 
know for sure how much will 
carry forward . 

Our council this year did a 
great job in budgeting a con-
servative dollar amount for our 
carry-forward, and now we have 
the flexibility to put those funds 
back into the line items that we 
previously had to cut." 

The carry-forward in 2004-05 
from the previous year was also 
larger than anticipated by about 
$121,000, according to Murphy. 

The newfound funding pres-
ents a potential bone of conten-
tion as many A.S. senators want 
to see that money go to their 
preferred organizations. 

In the original 005-06 budget, 
the A.S. Council voted to spend 
more money on student orga-
nizations and less on A.S. Safe 
Rides than originally proposed 
by A.S. President Christopher 

Sweeten. Safe Rides, an A.S. ser-
vice, formerly known as Triton 
Taxi, that provides free trans-
portation home to intoxicated or 
otherwise stranded UCSD stu-
dents, had its funding cut down 
$1,400, to $27,000, in order to 
add to annual event funding. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Senior Senator Kate Pillon, a 
proponent of A.S. Safe Rides, said 
she predicts that the program will 
be one of many considered when 
it comes to additional funding. 

"Now that we have all the 
numbers from last year] think we 
will be able to better eva luate how 
much we need in the ISafe Rides] 
account this year," Pillon stated 
in an e-mail. "If we were right 
about the prediction last year and 
we don't need the $1 ,400, then 
there is no need to put it back 
there. All I am concerned about 
is that the program can run at 
its full capacity .... If that means 

allocating more money, that's 
what 1 think we need ." 

Murphy expects some senators 
to advocate giving more money 
to college councils or to fund 
more operations, such as student-
initiated ouueach and A.S. Safe 
Rides. 

He said he hopes senators will 
vote for more funding for cam-
pus student organizations and the 
A.S. programming office to go 
toward events like the Sun God 
Festival. 

"My basic concern is that if 
we decide to allocate more to our 
line items, that we do it fairly 
and consistently," he said. "J also, 
hope to see a large portion of the 
carry-forward stay in our general 
unalloca ted account to pay for 
those things that randomly come 
up in the middle of the year.

Wood said. 
He said that Cdigix works 

like most other Windows-based 
subscription services, but would 
not comment on pricing because 
financial terms of the deal are 
currently tentative. 

Cdigix, a service exc lusive 
to college campuses, offers four 
areas of digital media: Ctrax, 
a music library of 1.5 million 
legally downloadable so ngs; CAix, 
for video media from companies 
such as ES Pl ; Clubs, which dis-
tributes educational media; and 
Cvillage, which handles cam pus 
media distribution, according to a 
Cdigix press release. 

"The commitment by the uni -
versities to introduce Cdigix to 
their tudents is yet another show 
of support of the entertainmcnt 
industry's Hght against piracy, " 
the press release stated. 

UCSD is not expected to 
accept I apster's offer because it 
would force the university to pay 
expenses that Cdigi .~ agreed to 
cover, Wood sa id. 

Ilowever, the company 
remains optimistic that other UC 
campuses will accept its bid. 

"We have been talking with a 
bunch of UC schools," apster 

spokesperson Avery Cotler said. 
"We are in talks, but I just can't 
comment until the deal is done. 
So far, we have almo t 29 cam-
puses on line and now we have 
ju t partnered with Dell and XM 
Radio. We are a sma ll compa ny, 
but we are music people. We have 
the deepest catalog of songs and 
we have good relations with vari-
ous artists." 

Severa l universities, includ-
ing CSD, have been court-
ing legal file-sharing networks 
in response to the Recording 
Industry Association of America's 
crackdown on college campuses 
for illegal Hie sharing. 

Last year, the RlAA sued 27 
UC 0 students for downloading 
music illegally. The students fac-
ing litigation from the RIM were 
using the "i2 hub" network, which 
is based on I nrernet:? - a tech-
nology exclu,ive to 200 collcg!! 
campuses. Although i2hub limited 
its access to only Internet2 users, 
students who used it to download 
music illegally were targeted by 
th e I~IAA . 

"There were more than a 
co uple students [who faced legal 
troublesJ with the RlAA ," Wood 
said. "By the end of spring we 
turned in the names of laboutJ 

25 students. Once [they contact 
usJ, it is Out of our hands. They 
sent us a subpoena and we were 
obligated to respond ." 

Wood said that if illegal file 
sharing is detected on an IP 
address located at UCSD, the 
owner of the copyright for the 
material could contact him with a 
warning and that he would pass it 
on to the user. 

Students who had been shar-
ing large numbers of files were 
warned, and subsequently sued, 
by the RlAA. 

While RlAA spokesperson 
Amanda Ilunter stated thar most 
of the students sued last year have 
already settl ed, she would not 
comment on the dollar amount of 
each settlement. Currently, 16 of 
27 individual users at CSD have 
settled Oll t of court, according to 
[ I unter. 

Although CSD is expected to 
offer students access to discount-
ed subscri ption~ to Cdigix and 
possibly other vendors, Wood 
sa id he expects the RIAA to con-
tinue to monitor the practices of

Funds: Higher enrollment 
a factor in large carry ... over 

conlimied from page 7 
events Ithat) most directly affect 
the most number of students will 
see an increased allocation. " 

Pillon wouJd like to see some 
money go into the student orga-
nizations unallocated line items, 
as that is a place in the budget 
where she sees financial gaps. 

"Not only did we keep the line 
item roughly the same as last year, 
which doesn't allow for the nec-
essary growth that occurs every 
year in student organizations, but 
we are requiring the college fes-
tivals, Cultural Celebration and 
Ellcel Leadership conference to 
request out of it," Pillon stated in 
an e-mail. "That's over $30,000 
worth of programs more that 
need to come out of the stu-
dent orgs. unallocated line items, 
which stayed roughly the same as 
last year. It is just not enough to 
adequately support our student 
organizations and their events." 

Murphy attributes the larger-
than-predicted carry-over to a 
variety of factors, including an 
increase in UCSD student enroll-

are not used automatically carry 
forward to the next fiscal year. 
More specifically, we had ~ome 
staff salary carry forward because 
a couple of positions were not 
filled during certain periods of 
last year." 

One example of a program 
that spent less than allocated is 
student outreach, which is con-
tributing $2,651.22 to this year's 
carry-over. 

The A.S. Council also voted 
last spring to eliminate stipends 
multiple positions, including the 
A.S. elections manager and all 24 
A.S . senators. 

"I would still like the majority 
of the money to stay in general 
unallocated, however .. . it is not 
necessary to spelld money just 
because we have it," Pillon said.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK 
MONDAY, EPTEMBER 26, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Eleanor Roosevelt College freshman Elgene Crescini carefully studies the campus map in search of the lecture hall for his next class. It takes him a few 
moments, but he finally gathers his books and heads out. 
Cresenci is among the bright-eyed freshmen who must 
not only find their way around the large campus but also 
in the world of academia. 

According to a repon by ACr, producer of one of the 
nationally administered tests used for college admissions, 
half of high school graduates statting college this fall do 
not have the reading skills needed to succeed in college 
courses. Even fewer are prepared for college-level math 
and science courses. 

The repo" used the ACT College-Readiness 
Benchmark, first developed last year, which correlates test 
scores of earlier students and the grades that they received 
in' their first year of college. 

"The reason for the report is simply to help future 
generatioll~ of students to prepare themselves better, to be 
able to see where we are now and how well we are prepar-
ing them in general for college," ACT spokesperson Ed 
Colby said. 

According to the benchmark, students who score 21 or 
higher on the ACT reading test are "likely to succeed," or 
eam a "C" grade or higher in their college social science 
courses. Only 51 percent of the 2005 graduates reached 
that score. 

Additionally, only 41 percent and 26 percent of those 
students reached the benchmark for math and science, 
respectively. There were 1.2 million students who took 
the test last year. 

While only 14 percent of graduates in California took 
the ACT, as opposed to the more popular Scholastic 
Aptitude Test, college readiness has been a long-standing 
issue among educators and policy makers. 

Colby said that the root of the problem lies in failing to 
prepare students while they're still in high school. He said 
that more informative programs addressing the impor-
tance of challenging students early on should be available 
to parents and teachers. 

"We're urging schools and also the states to look at 
their graduation requirements, making surc that those 
requirements are at a certain level for students to be pre-
pared for college and the work force," Colby said. 

Director of Media Relations of Student Educational 
Achievement Michael Dabney, who provides academic 
enrichment programs for students both in high school 
and the undergraduate level, said that lack of suppo" from 
parents sometimes prevents students from getting the 
preparation they need. This could be a result of students 
coming from low-income families or having parents who 
have not attended college themselves and do not have 
proper infonnation for their children. 

"Parents playa "ery integral part in student preparation 
in college," Dabney said. "Even beHeving that college is 
possible is necessary." 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of Admissions Mae Brown 
agrees that early preparation is key to success in college 
and having support from parents can help students to bet-
ter equip themselves for the future. 

mostly because those admitted were already part of an 
academically strong pool. 

Students accepted to any UC campus must clear the 
Entry Level Writing Requirement (fonnerly Subject A) 
before they can sign up for writing courses. For a UCSO 
student, failure to meet this requirement could be a sig-
nificant roadblock to completing his or her college core 
sequence, such as Dimensions of Culture or Making of 
the Modem World, which are necessary to clear general 
education requirements. 

UCSD students who do not meet the minimum 
requirement of a score of three or higher on the College 
Board Advanced Placement Examination in English; score 
of a five or higher on the International Baccalaureate 
Higher Level Examination in English, a "C" or better in a 
UC-transferable English composition course or a passing 
score on the UC Analytical Placement Examination must 
complete course work at San Diego C ity College. Only 
after passing the exit exam for this course and maintain-
ing a "C" or better can students go on to their writing 
courses. 

"This requirement makes sure that when students 
come to their college writing sequences and other course 
that require writing, they will be able to communicate rea-
sonablyand have a certain degree of Hteracy that will allow 
them to succeed in those courses," Basic Writing Program 
Coordinator George Hansen said. 

Hansen estimates that 680 UCSD students will take 
the classes at SDCC to meet the requirement this fall. 

Higher-level math courses also require students to 
.:omplete either the S.A.T. n math exam with a certain 
score, Advanced Placement math, a UC-transferable 
course in mathematics or a placement examination. The 
requirements are similar for the chemistry and language 
depanments. 

Even with these requirements in place, those who will 
be attending college courses for the first time still have 
concerns. 

"I took all the AP classes," Crescini said. "I'm taking 
classes that I supposedly already had in high school, but 
honestly, I'm afraid that high school docsn't compare at 
aU." 

Since high school preparation is one of the key fuctors 
in college readiness, most seem to agree that students are 
not being offered the challenging courses that they need. 

According to a recent study by the Educational Testing 
Service, most Americans say that high schools arc not 
challenging students. 

"Parents by and large want all their students to gradu-
ate with the same ski lls and abilities as if they were all 
going to college," ETS spokesperson Tom Ewing s~lid . 
"They don't necessarily believe all tudents need to go 
straight to college, they may go to work or vocational 
school, but regardless of where they go, students should 
get the high-quality educations." 

ERC freshman I latty Lee said that she is aware vf 
the differences between college and her high school 
classes, but is not sure whether or not she is prepared for 
her courscs this fu ll. llowever, Lee ~'lid that ~he already 
took language classes at communiry colleges dul'ing high 
school.

A.c. T. study: A report indicates that ha~ of 2005 high school graduates 
do not have the reading skills needed to succeed in college courses. 

"We're admitting academically prepared students here 
at UCSD," Brown said. "tn the last year, only about 5 per-
cent of students were experiencing academic difficulties at 
the end of their first year." 

Brown said that most students at UCSO are doing well

"The question is: When the 
time comes, are we going to be 
ready? Will we understand enough 
science? And most importantly, will 
we have trained people who will 
know what to do? And that's what 
universities do. We need to prepare 
the world to detect problems," said 
Kennel, leader of a new program 
that will deal with global environ-
mental issues. 

Kennel will step down as SlO 
director by fall 2006 to lead the 
program and assume a teaching 
position. 

Faculty members at UCSD 
and SIO announced plans over the 
summer to develop a new collab-
orative initiative that focuses on 
addressing crucial environmental 
issues, including biodiversity, con-
servation, climate change, air pol-
lution and issues associated with 
the coastal cities of San Diego and 
Tijuana. 

The goal of the program will be 
to understand the nature of these 
environmental problems in terms 
of science, economics and culture, 
Kennel said. This knowleflge, in 

tum, is to be used by legislative 
bodies. 

"[E)ducating several genera-
tions of students about [environ-
mental] science is a main goal of 
this program as I understand it," 
said M yrl Hendershott, a professor 
of oceanography and supporter of 
the program. "I think it is a very 
important matter, one that the uni-
versity is in many ways uniquely 
equipped to address." 

Plans are quite premature, and 
a true agenda has yet to be cre-
ated. However, talk exists of a new 
building initiative requiring all new 
buildings to comply with new envi-
ronmental standards. 

The new program will join 
a national effort to improve the 
environment. Currently, there 
are 14 other programs in the 
United States, including projects 
at Columbia, Duke, Yale and UC 
Santa Barbara. 

However, UCSD's will be a 
unique, interdisciplinary effort, 
with the combined forces of multi-
ple depanments including biomed-
ical sciences, earth sciences, social 
sciences, information sciences and 

engineering, according to Kennel. 
"There is a tremendous amount 

already going on that we could tie 
together," Kennel said. "We want 
to collect the pieces of the mosaic 
into a very broad fabric that is big 
enough to solve problems." 

Various department profes-
sors, including Hendershott, have 
voiced thei r support for the pro-
gram, whether or not they are to 
be involved. 

However, coordination among 
departments and finding a common 
ground will be one of the biggest 
challenges that the program will 
face, according to Kennel , who 
acknowledged the difficulty in 
"getting a political cientist and an 
earth scientist to talk." 

Another challenge th e pro-
gram will face is the desire to meet 
"green" goals while facing often 
stark realities. This means al 0 tak-
ing finance, regulation and managc-
ment into consideration along with 
environmental concerns, according 
to Raymond Clemencon, a politi-
cal science professor at UCSO. 
Establishing "relevant practical 
implementation rather than feel-

good activism" will be one of the 
barriers the program will have to 
bypass, he said. 

Specifically, the program will 
focus on environmental sustainabil-
ity - a self-preserving practice for 
the human race, Kennel said. 

"If you look forward abollt 50 
years or so, you're going to find 
that the United Nations will pre-
dict that the world 's population will 
level off at about 9 billion, and that 
world population will have to feed , 
clothe and shelter itself," Kennel 
said. 

Kennel hopes to ride UCS O's 
recent wave of scienri fie notoriety, 
highlighted recently by ewswcek, 
whieh named the campus "hottcst 
for science" over the summer. 

"This is one of the most exciting 
scientific environments I've evcr 
been in," Kennel said. "The three 
areas that J think arc most impor-
tant to this program are ea rth i>Ci-
ence, biology and medi ci ne, and 
information science. Some univer-
sities may be better than UCSD in 
one of these areas, but I don't think 
any university in the country has a 
collection of the three as strong as 

UCSO." 
Funding for thc program is cur-

rently nonexistent, but will come 
primarily from federal research 
grants and private dono rs, with 
little or no funds coming from 
the university, Kennel said. The 
practice is co nsistent with most 
research done at UCSD, which is 
one of the most succcss fu I univer-
sities in the COUJ1try at obtai ning 
research grants, he said. 

"Somc of the science and engi-
neering required is global and can't 
be learned or practiced cheaply," 
he said. 

Although the program i~ still 
in the preliminary !.tages, there is 
lIluch support comi ng frolll the 
snldcnr population, Kcnnel ~aid. 

"Volunteers have nlfllcd up ~a)'­
ing they really wallt to \\ ork for 
us," he said. "Thi., is the 1II0,t elicit-
ing part of the process, e~peciall)' 
sincc there arc Illany profe~sors and 
students among the volunteers."

. Behind the 
Master Plan 

Part Two: 
Higher education 

blueprint may 
head for changes 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

I n 1960, a rivalry between California 's two top univer-sity systems - the University 
of California and the precursors 
to the Cali fo rnia State University 
system - gave birth to the state's 
Master Plan for Higher Education, 
a document laying the foundation 
and infrastructure for the state's 
college-bound students. Ea rlier 
this swnmer, the two sides agreed 
to change one of the plans central 
tenets, the UC system's exclusive 
control of doctora te degrees. As 
part of the summer deal, the elite 
un iversity system sa id it would 
allow for CSU campuses to award 
the education doctorate. 

But that agreement places the 
rest of the Ma ter Plan in a conun-
drum: If the university admits that 
the doctorate provisions of the doc-
ument have become outdated, then 
perhaps the enti re documcnt isn't 
as holy as UC leaders continue to 
maintain , and perhaps other por-
tions need to be revisited as well . 

"Ln ofar as the doctorate again 
becomes an i ue of contention, it 
cou ld spark [talks about the rest 
of the plan]," said Ethan Rarick, 
whose recent biography of forrner-
Cov. Pat Brown suggests that the 
universities' competition over the 
degree - the "Golden Fleece" of 
higher ed ucation - largely igni ted 
the dialogue that led to the Master 
Plan. 

According to Jennifer L illa, 
who served as president of the UC 
Srudent Association last year, the 
document has already stopped being 
a doctrine that is set in stone. ' 

"The Master Plan, just as any 
document, is a malleable docu-
ment," she said . "Pcople use it the 
way they want to use it, to sui t 
their pol itica l siruation. And it's 
rea lly frustrating, because people 
laud it as the paragon of hjghcr 
education." 

Yet UC Director of Educational 
Relations lbdd G reenspan argues 
that any changes that needed to be 
made already have been, through 
iterative reviews spearheaded by the 
state Legislature - even though 
these appear to be the very kind of 
political meddling that the Master 
Plan 's authors hoped to avoid. 

"I'm Idnd of surprised when 1 
see statements in the newspapers 
that this is a 45-year-old document 
and that it hasn 't been reviewed," 
he said. "That's just not true. It's a 
living document and it has evolved. 
... Basica ll y, its core parts have been 
reaffinned by the Legislarure." 

But the view that the document 
may not be that sacred has found 
supporters in the highest echelons 
of state governll\ent. In his com-
pact with the CSU and UC sys-
tems, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
has promised university funding 
estimates that are largely divorced 
from the levels projected in the 
higher education blueprint, with 
even the Legislative An alyst'S Office 
calling the governor's formula arbi-
trary. T he budget compact also 
requires UC campuses to play a 
bigger part in tra ining the state's 
math and science teachers, a role 
the crafters of the Master Plan saw 
as the exclusive responsibility of the 
CSU system. 

In his 2005 budget, 
Schwarzenegger also proposed 
diverting thousands of UC-qual i-
6ed students in to community col-
leges - a plan later abandoned 
after drawi ng substantiaJ criticism 
- marki ng the first time in more

'Plan: "Golden Fleece" plan unraveling 
continued from page 13 

than four decades that students 
eligible under the guidelines of 
the Master Plan would not have 
had a place on a UC campus. 

On the other hand, state law-
makers as high up as Assembly 
Speaker Fabian N unez, Lt. 
Gov. Cruz Bustamante and state 
Superintendent of Ed ucation 
Jack O'Connell have all suggest-
ed that, perhaps, the UC cam-
puses should be enrolling more 
students than the caps set in the 
Master Plan. 

During debates over the tight-
ening of eligibility last fall, all 
three opposed a proposal - later 
adopted by the regents - to 
reduce the number of students 
eligible to apply to the university 

to the Master Plan levels. 
Schwarzenegger's lateS[ 

appointee to the UC Board of 
Regents, businessman Frederick 
Rui z, also suggested that the caps 
were not as hallowed as the rest of 
the board believed, voting against 
the changes. 

"Today, we lcind of see the 
Master Plan brealcing down ," 
Rarick sa id, explaining that the 
state has stopped providing the 
kind of funds that would make 
the vision of the original docu-
ment a reality. "I think actually 
the state is already unintention-
ally revisiting a lot of the issues 
of the Master Plan, because if 
we don't begin to invest more 
heavily in higher education, we 
won't have space for every stu-

dent .... Whether we intend to or 
not, we're already revisiting the 
Master Plan." 

Rarick likes to point to a 
historical comparison: During 
Brown 's tenure as governor, the 
state built three new UC cam-
puses; in the subsequent 30 years, 
the state opened none. 

Whether the r.ew debate 
over the Golden Fleece forces 
Californja to rethink its long-term 
higher education vision, he argues 
that those numbers alone show 
that the Master Plan has largely 
lost its ability to keep higher edu-
cation a state priority. 

Greenspan and other UC 
heads, including UC President 
Robert C. Dynes, on the other 
hand, disagree. 

Study: College success starts 
in high school, experts say 

continued from page 9 
classes]," Lee said. "But I kind of 
know what to eKpect in college, that 
there's going to be nobody babying 
me, watching out when or if J go to 
class. 1 know that r have to do it on 
my own." 

For UCSD students who do 
find themselves in a bind during 
the quarter, several programs offer 
assistance. The Office of Academic 
Support and r nstructional Services 
(O.A.S.LS.) offers tutoring in vari-
ous subject areas from math to lan-
guage classes. OAS.l.S. also has 
a Summer Bridge Program where 
selected incoming freshmen attend 
classes during the summer for four 
weeks. The program also includes 

activities that help su.dcnts a cli-
mate to UCSD. 

"The first year is such a critical 
year in a student's academic career," 
Dabney said. "Everything's new, and 
everything's 3 challenge. College life 
can be overwhelming if you're not 
prepared for it." 

Dabney said that the biggest 
obstacle to early preparation and 
avoiding difficulties during college 
is an overall commitment to educa-
tion from all areas. 

"I feci that commitmenr needs 
to be there," Dabney said. "The 
ed ucational system needs to be re-
CKamincd and we need to ask our-
selves if we are tr-dining the best 
students that we can."

Davis football upsets 
Stanford in final seconds 
Aggies hand Cardinal first loss 
to non-Division I-A opponent 

By DAN McMENAMIN 
The California Aggie (UC Divis) 
(CSTV U-WIRE) DAVIS, 

Calif. - People will be talking 
about this game for a while. 

The UC Davis football team 
went into Stanford Stadium on 
Sept. 17 as heavy underdogs in a 
game against the Cardinal, which 
had never lost to a non-Division 
I-A team. 

But it was the Division 1-AA 
Aggies who had the last word in 
the game. 

UC Davis (1-2) surprised 
Stanford (I-I) with an unexpected 
20-17 comeback victory, capped 
off by a short touchdown pass 
from Davis quarterback Jon Grant 
to Davis wide receiver Blaise 
Smith, which put the Aggies in 
the lead with just eight seconds 
left in the game. 

That score completed an 
improbable comeback by the 
Aggies, who trailed 17-0 in the 
second quarter before rolling off 
20 unanswered points to come up 
with the historicaJ victory over 
Stanford. 

Several thousand students, 
alumni and fans made the trip 
down to Palo Alto, CaJjf., to see 
the historic game, cheering on 
their team as it made the come-
back charge. 

"When they announced the 
schedule, our fans were really 
excited and got together and 
bought tickets," Aggie defensive 
line coach Fred Arp said. "I've 
been here 39 years and nothing 
compares." 

Davis caught a bit of a break 
in the first quarter when Cardinal 
starting quarterback Trent 
Edwards went down with a hand 
injury. 

Edwa rds' absence added 'to the 
setbacks of a Stanford team that 
was already missing the contri-
butions of Evan Moore, its top 
wide receiver, who dislocated his 
hip in the team's season-opening 
41-38 win over the U.S. aval 
Academy. 

These key injuries, as well as 
an impressive performance by the-
Davis defense, kept the Cardinal 
offensive team out of the end zone 
for the entire game. 

Nevertheless, the home team 
capitali zed o n some early Aggie 
mistakes to jump out with a quick 

lead. After Stanford kicked a 
field goal, its defense scored two 
touchdowns off of Aggie fumbles, 
including a 54-yard fumble return 
for a touchdown by linebacker 
Michael Craven that made the 
score 17-0 late in the second quar-
ter. 

However, the Aggie defense 
brought the team right back 
into the game by recovering two 
Stanford fumbles and giving the 
offense the opponuniry to convert 
them into touchdowns. Running 
back Nelson Dons finished both 
of these drives with touchdowns, 
which cut UC Davis' deficit to 
17-14 midway through the third 
quarter. 

The Aggies had a few chances 
to score in the fourth quarter, 
but kicker Emmanuel Benjamin 
missed two mid-range field goals 
that could have tied the game. 

Davis' third and final chance 
came with just under three min-
utes left in the game. After com-
ing up shoTt in the two previous 
offensive drives, Grant's third try 
was the charm as he led the Aggies 
72 yards down field for the win-
ning touchdown. 

On that decisive drive, Grant 
was responsible for every yard that 
the team gained on offense, com-
pleting five passes for 57 yards 
while also making three rushes for 
15 yards. 

With the game on the Line, and 
the clock ticking down to less than 
10 seconds left, Grant scrambled 
toward the sideline on a third-
down play and found Smith open 
on the side of the end zone. T he 
three-yard score gave the Aggies 
the 20- 17 lead with eight seconds 
left. 

Stanford had the chance to 
make one last throw, but it fe ll 
incomplete, givi ng the Aggies the 
historic victory. 

After the final whistle sounded, 
many Aggie players went to the 
stands to thank the fans that had 
craveled out [Q the Bay Area [Q 
SUppOTt them. 

Other players from the team 
snuck up behind Davis head coach 
Bob Biggs and doused him with a 
tub of Gatorade to celebrate th e 
upset vic[.[1ry. 

"That's just an . un believable 
win, the way those guys battled 
back," Biggs said, sti ll soaked from 
his Gatorade shower.

No.5 Tritons extend season record to 14--2 after Slug Fest 
By ANGELA LIN 

Associate Sports Editor 

T he CSD men's wate r polo 
tea m kicked off the UC anta 
C ruz lug Fest with two big wins 
over Santa C lara University and 
Ca liforn ia Luthe ran niversityon 
Sept. H. 

T he o. 5 Tritons improved 
the ir overall record to 14-2 by 
beating the ama Clara Broncos 
12-5 and showed no signs of wea-
riness later tllat day, cruising past 
t he Ca l Lutheran Kingsmen with 
J score of 17 - I . T he men post-
ed some big scores in the fourth 
period agai f!~t the Broncos with 
li \ e goal~ and opened hig with 
J 7- 1 ha lftime lead agai nst the 
Ki ngsmen three hou rs later. T he 
I'ritom then added six more goals 

in the third pe riod and another 
four to close out the match. 

This week, senio r Jo nathan 
Ilo pki ns, from Coronado, was 
na med the TritOn Athlete of the 
W eek. Il opkins, in the course of 
his collegiate career, has twice been 
na med the Di vision Il Player of 
the ea r and Division I honorable 
mention. In 16 games, Hopkins 
currently leads th e team with 31 
goa ls and 23 as ists. 

The Tritons have steadily 
increased their national ranking 

th i~ eason , starting the ea on at 
o. 8 and moving up to fifth last 

week. The standing comes as no 
surprise - II of the 29 players on 
the team are seniors, making the 
Tritons one o f the most experi-
enced teams in the coun try. 

The Tritons came into the 
Slug Fest with a big 7-5 win over 
10th- ranked Loyola Marymount 

niversity on Sept. 23 . 
The men hosted Loyola in 

front of 1,091 fans at Canyon view 
Aquatic Center, handing the Lions 
their sixth loss of the season. 

The Tritons put their first mark 
on the board witll a goal from 
sophomore drian Jerkovic at the 
three-minute, 51 -second mark. 
T hree minutes later, Jerkovic was 
able to fi nd another hole and put 
the hall thro ug h the righ t side of 
the net, givi ng the T ritons a 2-0 
lead. 

' enior Chri s E ichholz was able 
to ne t anothe r goa l at the 6:45 
mark of the second period before 
the Lions answe red back with one 
o f their own , making the score 
3- 1. Senior C hris Finego ld then 
took a pass and rammed it past 
the goalie to resume the ' rritons' 
three-goal lead . 

The team 's fifth goal came 
econds later after Jerkovic broke 

away from the pack with a steal 
before being fouled and awarded 
a penalty shot. Hopkins made the 
shot to give the Tritons a four-goal 
lead . By the end of the half, senior 

Andrew Mo/Guordion 
Try me: Senior goalie Colin McElroy focuses on blocking a shot during practice. The Tritons will face Long Beach State on Oct. 1. 
Brandon Borso gave the Tritons 
another goal, but the Lions were 
able to score once more before the 
half was called. 

The Lions were able to catch 
up to the Tritons in the third quar-
ter, pulling within two goals and 

holding the men scoreless for the 
entire quarter. 

Coming off the momenwm of 
the third quarter, Loyola scored 
another goal with 4:41 remaining 
in the game. Junior Ty Lackey 
answered back with a hot in the 

upper right corner for the last goal 
of the game, giving the Tritons a 7-
5 win . Next month , the two teams 
will meet again in Lo Angeles. 

The men will have a week- long 
break before they face Long Beach 
State on Oct. I. 

Women's volleyball 
topples two CCAA foes 

Nicole Courtney's kills help Tritons 
top Chico, Stanislaus on the road 

By RAEL ENTEEN 
Sports Editor 

The women 's volleyball team 
added to its already impressive 
record in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association matches by 
taking out Chico State and Cal 
State Stanislaus in consecutive 
road wins on Sept. 23 and Sept. 
24, respectively. 

The No. II Tritons (12-
2 overall , 4-1 CCAA) beat the 
Warriors (2 -7 overall , 1-4 CCAA) 
on Sept. 24 in four games, 30-
23 , 30-20, 28-30, 30-21. Junior 

icole Courtney had 17 kills and 
five aces and led the Tritons to 
the much-needed victory. One 
of Courtney's 17 kills ended the 
first game for the Tritons and 
gave them a small lead after the 
Warriors kept it close throughout 
most of the opening set. 

In the second game, the 
Warriors jumped out to an early 
3-1 lead before the Tritons took 
advantage of three kills from 
freshman Rebecca Bailey and 
three errors by the Warriors to 
score six straight points for a 7-
3 advantage. T he Tritons never 
looked back, extending their lead 
to 19-7 before Courtney ended 
the game with a kill, giving the 
Tritons a 30-20 win in the game 
and a 2-0 lead in the match. 

T he Warriors managed to take 
the third game 28-30 after the 
Tritons fought to keep it close, 
but let the game slip away, despite 
taking a 27-24 lead late in the 
game. The Tritons were not fazed 
by the Warrior~' attempted come-
back, as they took a quick 12 -5 
lead in the final game on an ace 
from Bailey. 

The Warriors managed to fight 
back within four points, 20- 16, 
but CSD, led by another three 
kills from Courtney, pulled away 

for the 30-21 win in game four 
and a 3-1 victory in the match. 

The win came less than a day 
after the Tritons earned their 
third CCAA win over Chico 
State. The Tritons were tough on 
the Wildcats, who stole the first 
game 17-30, before the Tritons 
took over and came away with 
the next three games, 30-21, 30-
26, 30-22, and the victory. Once 
again, Courtney led the Tritons 
with 20 kills and 13 digs while 
junior Kristin Halvorsen added 
35 assists. 

"After we lost the first game, 
we realized that we needed to step 
up and really show them who the 
Tritons are," sophomore Amber 
Ries said. So we increased our 
energy and hustle and we came 
out and won the next three." 

The Tritons, now riding a four-
game winning streak, moved up in 
the CCAA standings after their 
last two wins. 

"We went into the games pret-
ty confident and we knew how we 
had to play to get the job done," 
Ries said. 

Now the Tritons have 13 
more league matches coming up 
to close out the regular season. 
The next two games will bring the 
Tritons home to face Cal State 
Dominguez Hills and Cal Poly 
Pomona on Sept. 30 and Oct. I, 
respectively. 

'''Our team is looking very 
good, seeing how many starters 
from last year we lost and how 
many players this year haven't had 
a whole lot of time playing college 
volleyball, " Ries said. "The rest 
of the season should go well if we 
play our be t. We have a couple 
of really strong opponents still to 
play, but I'm hopeful that with a 
littl e energy, confidence and fan 
suppOrt, it' still going to be a 
grea t eason . "
