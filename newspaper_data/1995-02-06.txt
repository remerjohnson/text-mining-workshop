LOS ANGELES - A UCLA 

. Campus Events advertisement 
depicting Jesus drew protest 
from the Rev. Paul Dechant, 
associate director of the 
University Catholic Center, at 
a recent student government 
meeting. The advertisement, 
whiclrshowed a drawing of 
Jesus labeled as "some holy 
guy" next to a rock band, 
asked the readers who they 
would prefer to see. "It is 
unacceptable at UCLA to 
degrade anyone because of 
their Jewish, African, Muslim 
or Latino heritage," Dechant 
wrote in a statement to the 
student government. "The 
exception though, seems to be 
in regards to symbols of 
Christianity." Student 
government members decided 
to defer action on Dechant 's 
complaint to a later time. 

UCD Students Take 
Integrity Pledge 
DA VIS - The UC Davis 
Campus Judicial Board 
sponsored Academic Integrity 
Week last week in an effort to 
make students more aware of 
the consequences of academic 
dishonesty. The board, which 
is comprised of 10 students 
and four faculty members, set 
up a table outside the dining 
commons and allowed 
students to take a pledge to 
uphold integrity. "If they 
commit to the idea of integrity 
in writing, then they are much 
more likely to follow 
through," board chairman 
Aaron Carruthers said. 

Ua.A Retrofit Could 
Cost $1 billion 
LOS ANGELES - UCLA's 
eight-year-old Seismic 
Correction Program could 
continue until the year 2007 
and could cost up to $1 billion, 
according to university 
officials. Current and planned 
construction costs total $155 
million, with up to 90 percent 
of the university 's seismic bill 
underwritten by the Federal 
Emergency Management 
Agency. The remaining 10 
percent will come from state 
and local sources as well as a 
$113 per year student fee, 
beginning Fall Quarter 1996.

State Democrats Blast Wilson Fee Hike 
BUDGET: Senators send 
letter to Wilson opposing 
bu~get proposal 
By Jonna Palmer 
News Editor 

Calling proposed higher educa-
tion fee hikes a "tax on the middle 
class," California Senate Democrats 
sent a letter to Gov. Wilson Tuesday 
sharply criticizing his state budget 
proposal, which would increase UC 
fees 10 percent per year for the next 
four years. 

Authored by Senate President Pro 
Tempore Bill Lockyer and signed 
by 22 Democratic senators, the let-
ter is the first strike by Democrats 
against Wilson's proposed fee in-
creases. 

" In the past five years ... student 
fees will have increased by 157 per-
cent at UC, 123 percent at the CSU 
and 350 percent at [community col-
leges]," the letter states. "This enor-
mously increases the burden on 
middle-class families that depend 
on these public universities and col-
leges for affordable higher educa-

"They ' re still low, but not as low

He added that the fee increases were 
intended to improve access to the 
higher education systems. However, Caves declined to com-

ment specifically on whether the 
letter would block Wilson 's budget. 

Carl Rogers, a spokesman for 
Wilson's education department, 
said, "There's no question that the

·Students' Backs 
PROTEST: Shirts collected 
from all nine ues will be given

By Ivan DelYenthal 
Senior Staff Writer 

Students at all nine UC campuses will be 
"giving the shirts off their backs" for the next 
two weeks to protest a 10-percent fee increase in 
Gov. Wilson's proposed budget. 

The campaign, which was initiated by the 
University of California Students Association 
(UCSA), culminates before next Thur day 's 
9:30 a.m. regents meeting at UCSD, at which 
they could vote on the budget. 

Shirts are being collected throughout the 
week at the Price Center and at the other UC 
campuses. The shirts will be signed by studp.nts 
at the Price Center on Feb. 15 and given to the 
regents preceeding Thursday 's meeting at the 
Price Center Ballroom. 

After the shirt-signing on Wednesday, A.S. 
will host "UCSD Unplugged," an all-night anti -
fee concert on the Price Center lawn from 4 p.m. 
until 11 a.m. Thursday.

SDSU President Steps Down Under Pressure from Chancellor 
RESIGNAnON: 
Thomas Day agrees to 
leave post by July 1996 
By Tom Barkley 
Associate News Editor 

San Diego State University Presi-
dent Thomas B. Day announced his 
retirement Wednesday, agreeing to 
step down in July 1996. 

Day came under pressure from 
California State University Chan-
cellor Barry Munitz, who felt that 
the future of SDSU wou Id no longer 
benefit from the president's high-

intensity leadership style, accord-
ing to the San Diego Union-Tri-
bune. 

Munitz also told the Union-
Tribune that his concern for Day's 
health factored into his decision to 
ask for his resignation. "[Day's] 
tenacious, committed, no-holds-
barred defense of San Diego State is 
all-consuming .... After a whjle, it 's 
my obligation to look after him not 
only professionally, but personally," 
Munitz said. 

Day, 62, became SDSU's sixth 
president in 1978, after serving as 
vice chancellor at the University of 

Maryland. His leadership tactics 
came under fire immediately, when 
he suggested closing several SDSU 
departments to deal with a budget 
crisis caused by Proposition 13. 

Day handled the 1992 budgetary 
problems in a similar fashion by 
putting forth a plan to shut down 
nine departments. Although the plan 
was not implemented, students dem-
onstrated and painted a mural de-
picting him with his head in the 
guillotine. The plan was aborted 
when special CSU funding was used 
to retain some of the classes. 

Day is recognized for solidify-

ing SDSU's "teacher-scholar" 
model, which attempts to keep class-
room teaching fresh through in-
creased faculty research. 

CSU will begin a nationwide 
search for Day 's successorin March, 
with a new president expected to 
hold office July 6. 

Day, who was a physics profes-
sor at the University of Maryland 
from 1961-64, earned his bachelor 
of science in physics from the Uni-
versity of Notre Dame. He began 
his post-graduate studies at Notre 
Dame and earned his Ph.D. from 
Cornell University in 1957.

Exiled Chinese Poet 
To Lecture on Campus 
READINGS: Bei Dao's work covers personal and 
political subjects from an exile's point of view 
By Erik Johnson 
Senior Staff Writer 

Bei Dao, one of China's premier 
poets, will hold a series of readings 
of his work at UCSD beginning 
Wednesday. Exiled in 1989 follow-
ing the Tiananmen square massa-
cre, Dao has been runner-up for the 
Nobel Prize in lit-
erature for the last 
three years for his 
innovative and 
sometimes politi -
cally charged po-
etry. 

In one of his poems, he wrote, "I 
am no hero/ In an age without he-
roes/ I just want to be a man." 

Born in 1949, the same year as 
the Communist Revolution in China, 
Dao served briefly as a member of 
the Red Guard. 

Later, Dao and other writers pub-
lished an alternative 
journal called Today 
which played a sig-
nificant role in the 
1978 movement for 
democracy 
China.

In his latest 
work, "Old Snow," 
Dao's contempo-
rary voice resonates 
with those of older 
Chinese poets . 
Dao 's poems, from 
mystical reflections 
on his life to politi-
cal calls for action, 
are colored by his 
state of exi Ie.

In early 1989, Daowrote an open

thors and intellectuals, urging the 
release of Chinese political prison-
ers. 

He is also a board member of the 
New York-based organization Hu-
man Rights in China. 

However, Dao says that he is not 
a political activist. "Politics is very 
different from poetry," he said. 

"In the last five years, I haven 't 
been involved in organized political 
protest. I talk in interviews about 
my difference of opinions with the 
government, but I don't think this is 
organized political activity."

Saying that he is weary of travel, 
Dao's plans after the spring are un-

"No one can see tomorrow," he 
said. 

Dao will read his poetry at the

UCSD Pioneer in Geophysics Honored 
The National Academy of Sciences will honor Victor 

Vacquier, professor emeritus of geophysics at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography (510), for his outstanding 
contributions to science. 

Vacquier. 87, is known for inventing the "flux·gate" 
magnetometer in the 1930s, which led to the discov· 
ery of magnetic patterns on the seafloor. 

The "flux·gate" magnetometer measures magnetic 
field more rapidly and with 100 times more sensitivity 
than previous instruments. It was originally used in 
aircraft during World War II to detect submarines. 

On oceanographic expeditions in the 1950s and 
1960s, Vacquier conducted magnetic surveys of the 
Pacific Ocean seafloor and found that similar mag· 
netic features were repeated on opposite sides of 
oceanfloor fractures. 

Since the fractures were hundreds of miles apart, 
the repetition was evidence of ·seafloor sprE:i:lding"; 
the result of the earth's large tectonic plates shifting 
their position. 

"His research has yielded not only new scientifIC 
knowledge, but also a wide range of research meth-
ods, instruments and geophysical concepts," 510 
Director Edward A. Frieman said of Vacquier. "It is 
fitting he should receive the honor." 

The academy will award Vacquier a bronze metal 
and a $6,000 prize. 

Vacquierwas born in Silint Petersburg, Russia, and 
came to the United States in the 1920s to study 
electrical engineering at the University of Wisconsin. 
He joined Scripps Marine Physical Laboratory in 1956. 

Clinch Mountain Boy. to Play 
Traditional Appalachian Music 

Bluegrass musicians Ralph Stanley and the Clinch 
Mountain Boys will be playing at Mandeville Audito-
rium on Fri., Feb. 17. at 8 p.m. 

Stanley, 68, has been performing bluegrass and 

traditional Appalachian Mountain music on the banjo 
since the early 1940s, basing his music on English 
ballads and tunes that were handed down from his 
mother and father. His mother played the two-finger 
·clawhammer" style of banjo picking. 

The Clinch Mountain Boys include bassist Jack 
Cook, who has played with Stanley for over 30 years, 
singer.guitarist Kenneth Davis and often, Stanley'S 
son, Ralph Stanley II. 

Stanley began his musical career with his brother 
Carter, touring as the Stanley Brothers. They appeared 
regularly on the Grand Ole Opry and toured the country 
and the world. 

The Stanley Brothers stopped performing after 
Carter's death in 1966. 

Tickets for the concert are $14 for general admis· 
sion, $12 for seniors, and $10 for students. For 
information call 534-4090.

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

PINION 
The 

Affirmative Action is Detrimental to 
Equal Opportunity 

By Derek van Hoften, Staff Writer 
"I have a dream that my four little chil-

dren one day will live in a nation where they 
will not be judged by the color of their skin, 
but by the content of their character." . 

- Marti n Luther King, Jr. 
Indeed, the dream has died. And nothing 

more clearly illustrates its death than affirma-
tive action. Few social policies have failed 
more miserably in achieving their goal than 
this program. Although affirmative action was 
intended to lift obstacles faced by minorities, 
it has instead exacerbated these disadvantages. 

It's time for California to eliminate affir-
mative action. Thankfully, the opportunity will 
come in the 1996 elections, with the Califor-
nia Civil Rights Initiative, a proposal which 
would end preferential treatment of women 
and minorities in job and college appl ications. 

Affirmative action does precisely the op-
posite of what King hoped would happen: It 
judges people by the color of their skin, rather 
than by their character or accomplishments. 
Hiring or accepting minorities over more 
qualified candidates of any color is a blatant 
form of discrimination. The 1986 Supreme 
Court ruling, which gave special treatment to 
minorities, "even when those who benefit 
have not themselves suffered from discrimi-
nation in the past and when those who are 
hurt have not themselves been responsible for 

,'1 , 

past discrimination," clearly demonstrates the 
absurdity of affirmative-action policies. 

Affirmative action misses its target in other 
areas, as well. The notion that this program 
helps poor or oppressed minorities is mislead-
ing; affirmative action is more likely to ben-
efit middle-class minorities who need less help 
succeeding. In his Washington Post column, 
William Raspberry noted, "The result [of af-
firmative action] is that some blacks - most 
likely those that have been least likely crippled 
by racism - get special-admission college 
seats and affirmative-action promotions ... . 
Black executives who already hold good jobs 
get promoted to better ones .... And the people 
who provide the statistical base get nothing." 

The 1986 Supreme Court decision ex-

posed that there is little 
distinction between minori-
ties who have suffered dis-
crimination and those who 
have not. Affirmative action 
assumes perpetual, universal 
discrimination against 01/ minorities, 
which simply isn't the case. Racism cer-
tainly exists and plays a role in some hir-
ing practices, but not to the extent that pro-
ponents of affirmative action suggest. So-
ciologist Charles Sykes points out that" .. .it 
is far from clear that overt racial bias is 
the dominant or determining factor in em-
ployment disparities. According to one 
study reported in Public Opinion, a ma-
jority of black Americans reported that 
they had never themselves been discrimi-
nated against on the basis of their race." 

Sykes identifies affirmative action's 
main problem: It attempts to provide 
equality of results, rather than equality of 
opportunity. Even if affirmative action 
were to target the correct and descrving 
segments of the population, it would still 
be inappropriate and detrimental to its 
stated objectives. Affirmative action 's ba-
sic tenet states that minorities are iII-pre-
pared for college and the workplace. This

We Must Open 
More Doors for 
Disad vantaged 
Students 
By Christina ' Baine 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Affirmative Action - these two words 
embody the ideals of American compromise 
- an agreement to progress forward. This is 
exactly why affirmative action was initiated 
during the Nixon administration, in the form 
of quotas. The country wanted to finally shed 
its repressive skin and move into an era of 

egalitarianism. Finally, women, African 
Americans, Latinos and other disadvan-

taged groups were allowed into the 
once-indefatigably guarded society of 

the white male. The original intent 
of this highly controversial pro-
gram was to open doors for mi-
norities. Now, there is contention 

that minorities have kicked the door 
down and a.re taking opportunities 

from more qualified Caucasians. 
It has been approximately 30 years since 

the birth of affirmative action. Many students 
who are now between the ages of 18 and 22 
have no recollection of the injustices which 
spurred the need for reparation. Everyone is 
familiar with the 1954 case of Brown vs. the 
Board of Education, but not about those cases 
which have lost some of their notoriety in the 
passing of time. 

Long before Brown, there was a 1936 case 
in which the Supreme Court overturned a 

Missouri state law barring African-
American students from attending the 
University of Missouri's law school, 
but giving these students tuition to 
attend out-of-state universities. Other 
states, such as Georgia, Maryland 
and Virginia, had similar plans, but 
were all desperately underfunded. 
Such blatantly racist attempts to 
segregate reveal the obstacles 
placed before minorities prior to 
affirmative action. 

In 1948, the Supreme Court 
convinced the University of 
Oklahoma to either accept 
African Americans into its law 

school or create another law program for 
them. Out of elitist spite, it chose the more 
costly route of creating a separate school. That 
same year, the University of Oklahoma was 
for.ced to admit African Americans into its 
other graduate programs. This time, however, 
the university did not have enough funds to 
create separate schools for each specialty. 

The university didn 't want to completely 
concede to the Supreme Court's decision, so 
it made a freak of the first of its African-
American students, O. W. Mclaurin. He had 
to sit in a desk designated solely for his use 
in the library, and a special room in the stu-
dent union was assigned to him for his meals. 
The university consented to the letter of the 
Supreme Court 's law; however, this did not 
stop it from dehumanizing and ostracizing 
Mclaurin. The lengths to which these uni-
versities went to avoid having minorities in 
their Wonder Bread environment is what 
prompted the government to establish affir-
mative action. Obviously, discrimination was 
an ever-present part of the system, and even 
Supreme Court rulings did little to change

COMMENTARY: The truth about affirmative action is often overshadowed by myths 

AN AFFIRMATIVE RESPONSE 
To dispel the myths about affir-

mative action, here are the facts: 
• All students who are admitted 

under affirmative action td the Uni-
versity of California must meet the 
academic 'Standards required for 
admission. 

• Affirmative action is not the 
same as special action. Special-ac-
tion admits are six percent of the 
total enrollment class. Four percent 
of these are set aside for disadvan-
taged students, which include En-
glish as a second language, absence 
among family members of anyone 
with a college degree, lack of ex-
posure to academic role models, 
work or other commitments during 
school, lack of exposure to domi-
nant culture and inadequate pri-
mary or secondary education. The 
other two percent is reserved for 
cases of special talent and techni-
cal exceptions including legacy. 
The majority of special-action ad-
mits are not students of color. 

• Affirmative action does permit 
students who, as a result of inad-
equate high school education, were 
unable to meet all the A-F require-
ments, but who are otherwise quali-
fied to enter the university. 

• Affirmative action is designed 
to retlect the broad cultural, racial, 
ethnic, geographic and socio-eco-
nomic diversity of California. 

The debate about affirmative ac-
tion revolves around the assump-
tion that students who do not meet 
certain standards are taking the 
slots deserved by others. This pre-
supposes that all individuals have 

access to the same pool of resources: 
a high school curriculum geared to-
ward college enrollment, exposure 
to academic role models, family 
members with a college degree and 
an environment conducive to learn-
ing. Yet, there is little or no debate 
about the actual implementation of 
affirmative-action programs or the 
feeble budgets upon which these 
programs depend. 

Therefore, discussion is now lim-
ited, resting heavily upon the asser-
tion that affirmative action is no 
longer needed. This suggests that 
racism and discrimination are no 
longer among our most demonizing 
problems. Within a larger context, 
urban centers which are populated by 
large numbers of people of color are 
suffering from the physical deterio-
ration of their neighborhoods. These 
populations are virtually powerless 
'in representation and ability to eco-
nomically affect their conditions. 
Affirmative action acknowledges 
that these inequities exist today. 
Strategies which attack affirmative 
action only serve to hide the inher-
ent injustice of this societ)'. 

In an attempt to broaden the pa-
rameters which have limited this 
discussion, consider practices in this 
country which have benefited the 
cause of white privilege. Red-lining 
practices are an American tradition, 
stemming from the earliest GI Bill, 
following the conclusion of World 
War II, and the creation of the Home 
Owners Loan Corporation, which 
guarantees low-interest loans for 
new homeowners. The corporation's

red-lining is the system of appraisal 
which rates districts in one of four 
categories. As a result of red-lining 
classifications, "traditional" fami-
lies more easily receive home loans, 
while poor, ethnic areas are consis-
tently denied loan approval. The 
first grade (A and green) describes 

areas which are homogenous and 
clean places of residence for 
"American" businessmen and pro-
fessionals . The second security 
grade (8 and blue) is "still desir-
able" but is not an A grade, due to 
the close vicinity of "undesirables. " 
The third grade (C and yellow) con-
sists of neighborhoods which are 
definitely declining. The fourth-
grade (0 and red) neighborhoods 
are described as areas "in which the 
things taking place in C areas have 
already happened." Certain people 
live in slums while others have ac-
cess to the suburbs. 

White affirmative action is the 
history of the suburbanization of the 
United States. Both the public and 
private sectors have combined in this 
effort. From this perspective, the 
cries of the disenfranchised become 
indictments of a system of white af-
firmative action, in which the backs 
of people of color have been the step-
ladder. For those who are interested 
in truth, this information is available 
in Chapter 11 of Kenneth T. 
Jackson 's Crabgrass Frontier. 

The debate over affirmative ac-
tion has been about as honest as the 
Price Center is integrated. Underly-
ing the rhetoric which consistently 
fills up the daily paper is a political 
struggle over access to higher edu-
cation and, in a larger sense, con-
trol of the resources of our society. 
In response to California's chang-
ing demographics, PropOsition 187,-
and indeed Gov. Wilson, rolled on 
a landslide of popular support. The 
next step is to eliminate the most 

hated of the civil-rights reforms: 
affirmative action . 

To say that affirmative action is 
a perfect program is to make one-
self susceptible to ridicule. We real-
ize that the program actually does 
not address the needs of the most 
economically and socially impover-
ished. Again, affirmative action is 
not a cure-all, and before target goals 
are met within the university, the 
philosophy of affirmative action will 
need to be embraced and equipped 
with the resources it needs to be 
more effective. Racism and discrimi-
nation are societal debts which must 
be paid sooner or later. History has 
given us glimpses with the Watts 
Rebellion and the uprising in Los 
Angeles. As Dr. David Breneman 
stated, " It [racial discrimination] is 
a recipe for disaster if continued, 
given the demographic tidal wave 
about to wash over this state." 

Our goal in writing this is to edu-
cate people who are uninformed 
about affirmative action, yet are 
convinced that they are aware of its 
policies and standards. We hope that 
people will educate themselves 
about the realities surrounding af-
firmative action, rather than being 
misled by commentators who are 
themselves misinformed, thereby 
perpetuating the myths.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, February 6, 1995 

COMMENTARY SIMPLE-MINDED AND OFFENSIVE 
Editor: 

I currently work in the Student 
Affirmative Action & Human Re-
lations Programs (SAA & HRP) and 
am a former chair and member of 
the Student Affirmative Action 
Commitlee (SAAC). I am also an 
ethnic-studies major who was very 
offended by Peter Chang's comment 
that my major does not "require the 
kind of education or thinking" re-
quired in other majors ("A Modest 
Proposal," Jan. 26). I would like to 
know how many ethnic-studies 
classes he's taken to make this ob-
serVation. I was also very offended 
by the way he displayed disrespect 
for the memory of Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. by mocking his words. 

In response to Chang, I thought 
the article was utterly ridiculous and 
incredibly simple-minded. First of 
all, in his flawed analogy of affirma-
tive action and basketball, Chang

proposes that Asians have nets at 
different heights to insure that once 
they are admitted to a team there is 
fair representation . I challenge 
Chang to find any professor on this 
campus who has a different grading 
scale for Student Affirmative Action 
(SAA) students. In this university, if 
you can't "score like the big boys," 
then you need to find a different way 
to score or a different game to play. 

Chang claims that UCSD low-
ered its SAT and GPA requirements 
for targeted groups. If this is the 
case, I would like to know where 
he got this information. I think the 
negative perceptions which many 
people have about SAA programs 
are based on misinformation. Many 
people confuse SAA efforts with 
admissions policies and with the 
category of special action. Accord-
ing to SAA & HRP, affirmative ac-
tion policies include "academic ad-

PROBLEM:

is generall y true, due to under-funded 
educational facilities, but granting 
minorities admission to colleges and 
entry into the workplace throws them 
into situations for which they are un-
prepared. It inevitably results in 
lower success rates, as evidenced by 
the 72-percent dropout rate among 
students who attend black colleges. 

Supporters of affirmative action 
feel that minorities should be thrown 
into situations which require pre-
cisely the preparation and training 
that they were denied in the first 
place. Efforts should be refocused to 
improve primary and secondary edu-
~--iiiiii" cation. If minorities were to receive 

adequate education before college, 
their success rate in the workplace 
would markedly improve. 

However, poor education is not 
the only reason for lower success

numbers invalidate the claim that 
underqualified minorities are stealing 
positions from white males. A 1990

crease the numbers of graduating 
high school seniors from 
underrepresented groups who are 
UC eligible. Special Action allows 
for students that did not meet all the 
university's A-F requirements, but 
who demonstrate outstanding ac-
complishment and ability to be ad-
mitted to UCSD." Students admit-
ted under special action are not nec-
essarily reflective of color, nor are 
they necessarily SAA students. 

According to Student Outreach 
an~ Recruitment, all UCSD appli-
cants are ranked according to an 
academic index based on GPA, 
course work beyond A-F, AP 
courses and test scores (maximum 
8000 points). This index is used to 
rank the first 60 percent of appli-

rates. Statistics show that during the 
early years of affirmative action, 
two-parent households fared far bet-
ter than single-parent households. 
According to the National Research 
Council, children of one-parent 
househo s scored lower on IQ- and 
school-achievement tests, earned 
less money with less-privileged jobs 
and were more prone to illegiti-
macy, dependency, poverty and 
crime, than children of two-parent 
families. King recognized the im-
portance of the family for poor mi-
norities: "Nothing is so much 
needed as a secure family life for a 
people to pull themselves out of 
poverty." Affirmative action does 
nothing to strengthen the family. 

Affirmative action was intended 
to be a temporary policy, but it has 
lingered on, without solving the 
problems which it set out to amend. 
In fact, conditions for minorities 
were better 16 years ago. According 

American males, only 581 attained 
bachelor's degrees. This contrasts 
with the 10,629 white males out of 
75;262 who attained bachelor's de-
grees. Six percent of African-Ameri-
can males received degrees, com-
pared to 14 percent of white males. 

In the work arena, the statistics 
are even more illuminating. In a 1990 
U.S. Department of Labor study, Af-
rican-American males account for 
11.3 percent of the unemployed, 
whereas white males account for 4.8 
percent. In 1991, unemployment 
among African-American and Cau-
casian males escalated, with each 
increasing by 1.6 percent. It is unfair 

cants. The remaining are ranked 
using this index plus other objective 
and subjective factors of which 
ethnicity is only one. Other factors 
include low income, veteran status, 
physical disability, residency, com-
munity service, leadership, honors 
and awards, special talents and spe-
cial circumstances or difficulties. All 
of these factors combined are worth 
a maximum of 2000 points, so no 
one can say that anyone can be ad-
mitted to UCSD because of his race. 

Most students who apply to 
UCSD are qualified. SAA is used to 
provide fairness in the admissions 
procedures for all students, particu-
larly for students who are qualified 
in every way except that their high 
school did not offer prep English or 
math (certainly not the fault of the 
student). Lastly, all students admit-
ted to UCSD are qualified to be here. 

EmeIyn ..... Pen. 

to the National Research Council, in 
1979, the average black woman 
earned eight percent more than the 
average white woman. Affirmative 
action has succeeded in reversing the 
trend toward racial amity which be-
gan in the 1970s.11 has increased the 
problem of racial discrimination by 
judging people by their skin color 
rather than by their character or ac-
complishments. And it has worsened 
minorities' positions in the work-
place. Yet, despite the enormous evi-
dence that affirmative action doesn't 
work, efforts are still devoted to ad-
justing or strengthening it, rather 
than examining other alternatives to 
the problem of racial disadvantage. 

Affirmative action is not a solu-
tion. Instead, inner-city and under-
developed schools should be brought 
up to par with that of the rest of the 
country. Only then will there be equal 
opportunity for all. For King's dream 
to live, affirmative action must die. 

to surmise that minorities are steal-
ing jobs when their unemployment 
is proportionally higher. 

If the California initiative to elimi-
nate affirmative action is passed in 
1996, there had better be a back-up 
plan which provides better resources 
for minorities. This plan needs to pre-
vent discrimination at its source: In-
equality must be eliminated starting 
at the elementary school level, thereby 
avoiding the entire issue of quotas at 
the university level and beyond. Ide-
ally, everyone would start out equally, 
which was the well-intended mean-
ing behind the late-blooming theory 
of affirmative adion.

Caves said that the quality of the

were to remain at their current level, 
but indicated that access might be 
affected if fees increase to percent 
for each of the next four years.

The anti-fee hike campaign is 
specifically targeting a proposed 
$360 per year increase in graduate 
and undergraduate fees, as well as 
an additional $1000-$2000, which 
professional students would have to 
pa y to attend the Uc. 

In 1985, the long-term fee Policy 
Bill capped fee increases at 10 per-
cent per year. However, the regents 
have disregarded the bill, raising 
fees by 136 percent over the last 
four years. Last quarter marked an 
18 percent increase from 1993-1994.

University of California Students 
Association Representative Kimi 
Lee said that she pleased that Demo-
crats have taken a stand against fee 
increases. However, she added that 
the regents have autonomy from the 
legislature, and could still choose to 
raise fees. "We think it's great... that 
the democrats [are] showing sup-
port for students, ... but we still have 
to be careful with the autonomy of 
the university," she said. 

Lee said that the regents fre-
quently discuss raising student fees 
as a first alternative to compensat-
ing for state budget shortfalls. She 
said that the regents could find other 

"Taking out massive loans and 
working over 40 hours a week is not 
an affordable education," falk said. 
"The UC Regents must make a stron-
ger commitment to provide an ac-
cessible education to all students 
across the state," she added. 

Based on Gov. Wilson's pro-
posed budget, which calls for a 10-
percent fee increase each year until 
the year 2000, UC Office of the 
President calculated that UC will 
receive approximately $36 million 
of new state support, while $80 mil-
lion must be funded by student fees, 
including enrollment, parking and 
on-campus housing costs.

crats are planning to take their mes-
sage to the students. "We want to try 
to increase visibility," she said. 

According to Caves, some of the 
senators will be attending rallies at 
college campuses to help organize 
students to fight the proposed fee 
hikes. "They're pricing kids out of 
an education," she said. 

paign organizer Erik Nielson said. 
Falk suggested other ways the . 

University of California could deal 
with the budget crisis. 

"All nine campuses are supposed 
to get several new buildings next 
year, but enrollment is droppi ngand 
wedon't see the need for new build-
ings right now." Falk said. 

So far the "Take the shirts off our 
backs but don't raise our fees!" cam-
paign has received only 15-20 shirts 
at UCSD. At UCLA, however, sev-
eral hundred T-shirts have been do-
nated. Collection points at UCSD 
are next to the hump and at the Price 
Center from 11:00 a.m. until 2:00 
p.m. through friday, Feb. to. 

"UCSD Unplugged" will feature 
local performers Knuckle Girl, 
Groove Omelette, Oversoul, Mon-
key Wagon, Wheel, and John

the idea to start out the day with a 
Bloody Mary, except without the 
tomato juice, mix and celery. A small 
group quickly formed and made the 
bottle of Vodka into breakfast. It 
looked stupid enough for me, so I 
joined in. 

At some point in the morning, 
two people puked in their seats. No 
one seemed to notice by that point. 

When we arrived at Steamboat 
after 24 hours, only five 12-packs 
and a scattering of vodka bottles 
remained. We had survived. 

The bus ride, in fact, was easy 
compared to years past, which are 
recounted in stories of broken-down 
buses, snow storms and 30-hour 
trips.

Getting out on the slopes became 
something to look forward to, once 
I realized that cold air felt good 
when your head throbbed and your 
mouth felt like the dried-up sock 
that had been stuck in your ski boot 
all the day before. 

Steamboat boasts some of the 
bestskiingin the country , with plenty 
of black and blue mogul slopes, and 
long runs that keep you interested. 

On Tuesday evening, snow fell 
on Steamboat,leavinga foot-and-a-
half of fresh powder. 

Wednesday was the one day I got 
up early, and once I figured out how 
to make turns under all that snow, I 
had one of the best skiing days of 
my life. 

Skiing, however, was a mere 
conversation piece in the All-Cal 
party. The real action took place off 
the slopes. 
The 41st Winter C ..... lv .. 

The All-Cal isn't just a vacation 
of skiing and partying. Okay, it is, 
but it also includes a competition 
between the University of Califor-
nia campuses for the vaunted AII-
Cal Cup. 

Now in its fourth decade, the 
schools compete in ski racing, drink-
ing games, dirty dancing and idiotic 
winter sports such as snow volley-
ball (try spiking in ski boots). 

UCSD sends the most students 
every year (possibly due to the pent-
up frustrations of being a college 
student in geriatric La Jolla), and is 
the team to beat. Nobody could re-
call the last time UCSD gave up the 
All-Cal cup. This may be the one 
UCSD competition which invokes 
that elusive thing called "school 
spirit." 

Although scheduling connicts 
resulted in two separate AII-Cals 
this year, with UCSD battling UC 
Riverside and UC Irvine, the com-
petition for the cup was intense dur-
ing the week. Because it sent only 
200 students this year, UCSD's title 
was at stake. 
(Special) Ice Capadu 

Broomball has to be the dumbest 
sport ever played. Twenty people 
wearing tennis shoes on an ice 
"court" fall down and run into walls 
as they chase a ball with small rakes. 
However, a game 's value is rarely 
measured by how much sense it 
makes; and the broomball tourna-
ment moved the UCSD team into an 
early lead on Monday. 

UCSD beat UC Irvine and UC 
Riverside, winning the match against 
the latter when first-year student 
Angel Lopresti made her second 
shoot-off goal. 

The ice-sculpture contest came 
after broomball. Following the 
theme "Heaven and Hell," our team 
scu Ipted a student passed out be-
tween a bottle of Jack Daniels and a 
toilet bowl filled with puke. A local 
dog ran up to the third-place sculp-
ture, lifted its leg on the student, and 
licked the hot chocolate which was 
poured into the toilet bowl to look 
like vomit. Fitting.

ALL-CAL: 
UCSD came up big 
in dirty dancing 
ContInued from .,... 9 
confrontation would be played out 
for the cup. 

UCSD and UC Irvine were neck 
and neck, and only two competi-
tions remained: Thumper and dirty 
dancing. 

The sport of Thumper involves 
an intricate combination of rhythm, 
recall, speed and the ability to re-
main conscious, as you beat the table 
and try to eliminate your opponents 
by showing the other team's sign, 
usually a gesture, without them no-
ticing.

"From D" Bates has mastered these 
skills and has taken the game to a 
new level, uMervingopponents with

From D, the returning champion, 
sparred against seven UC Irvine 
enemies in the final round of 
Thumper, being the only UCSDstu-
dent left after all his teammates were 
eliminated. 

Even facing these odds, his an-
tics went on unabated. He called "I 
want you" to one of the female op-
ponents and discussed course mate-
rial with one of the guys in an effort 
to throw them off. 

Although From B went down in 
the end, he put up a heroic fight. 
Gruesome ThreesoMes 

The stage was set for the final 
competition: dirty dancing. 

The UCSD Guardian 

UCSD had lost its edge after the 
Thumper upset and would have ~ 
tum raunchy in the dancing contest 
to remain proud. We were not to be 
outdone. 

The dancing started out innocent 
enough, but turned ugly when each 
man took on two women and clothes 
began falling to the floor. 

Although a full description is 
inappropriate and lost in a fuzzy 
memory bank, modesty was cer-
tainly not the dancers' main con-
cern. 

UCSD ' s talented threesomes 
took first and second place in dirty 
dancing, bringing home thecup once 
again. 
Homew_ Bound 

The bus ride back was basically 
a blur, which either means I had a 

great time or that I had killed off the 
remainder of my brain cells. 

The partying picked up for a 
while, but nearly everyone passed 
out early, except for some poor 
masochist who vowed to stay up all 
night and party. 

Everyone was on a more friendly 
basis. especially one of the women 
by the bathroom, who goosed ev-
eryone who passed. 

We put back more cans of Key-
stone Light, circulated the bear bong 
and lost the rest of our cash in Las 
Vegas, but the bus seemed to move 
more easily down 1-15 on the way 
home, and we were back in San 
Diego in 17 hours.

Alpha Chi Omega 
Have a Heart Week 

For those of you who 
think that the Greek' System has 
nothing to offer but large social 
gatherings, exchanges and dances, 
think again . Sororities and 
Fraternities individually 
participate in philanthropies. This 
involves haVing annual events to 
raise money for a particular 
organization. Alpha Chi Omega 
dedicates the month of February to 
their involvement in such events. 

When Alpha Chi Omega 
colonized at UCSD in the Spring of 
1992, they decided that they needed 
to set a time throughout the year to 
focus their attention on their local 
philanthropy, The Women of 
Domestic Violence. The charter 
class came up with "Have a Heart 
Week" and has made it a tradition 
ever since. '''Have a Heart Week' is 
a time when we take a hands-on 
approach to helping others and to 
makeadifferencein'someoneelse's 
life," reveals Katie Jardine, Alpha 
Chi Omega's Chapter President. 
"Have a Heart Week" has been 
celebrated in many different ways. 
There have been nights of bowling 
and sharing sundaes, to days of 
sitting in the Price Center selling 

baked goods or collecting cans and 
clothes to take down to the San 
Diego Battered Women's Shelters. 

In 1992, Alpha Chi 
Omegas all over the nation decided 
to adopt Women of Domestic 
Violence as a national altruistic 
project. The money which is raised 
is given to these shelters to help the 
thou sands of women who are 
victims ofthis abuse. [tis a fact that 
every fifteen seconds, a woman in 
the United States is abused by her 
husband, boyfriend, or live-in 
partner. We have to realize as a 
group of women that this could 
happen to us, so it is extremely 
important to us to make this 
contribution. 

Laura Dickson, Rush 
Chair of Alpha Chi Omega, feels 
that "Have a Heart Week" is "our 
chance to raise funds and plan 
activities that will benefit the well 
being of others." This year, "Have 
a Heart Week" falls on February 8,9 
and 10. .HA

Greek Perspectives ... {~(rj;:~;:~-\.~ 
~J"""\I"~ Domestic Violence - ~ ~~ 

Sally sits trembling on 
the floor, while watch ing the blood 
ooze from her wounds. MPlease 
don' t hurt me," she whispers, just 
as a hand comes crashing against 
her face, knocking her head against 
the stove. She tumbles over, 
unconscious. Rushed to the 
emergency room, she claims to 
have fallen down the stairs ... The 
sad thing about it is that instead of 
leaving "him," she keeps going 
backbecauseshe" loveshim.H This 
is a scenario common among most 
women who have experienced 
domestic violence. No matter 
what anyone says, be it friends, 
family or loved ones, the man is 
never wrong and there's always 
an excuse to stay. 

The cycle of abuse falls 
into three main categories. This 
includes the tenSion-building 
phase, the beating phase, and the 
loving phase. ltissimplyamazing 
how many women fall for "I love 
you;" ''I'm sorry/ or H I'll never do 
it again," and the cycle continues. 

The image of what most 
people have of the victims is 
skewed. Stereotypically, battered 
women are those who are 

uneducated, and have a lower 
economic status. According to the 
American Psychological 
Association, approximately Hone in 
three US women will be assaulted 
by a male partner during her 
lifetime. n Domesticviolenceoccurs 
at a rate of about forty percent, and 
ranges anywhere from severe 
beatings, to the use of a weapon. 

Domestic Violence may be 
one of the most under-reported 
crimes in theUStoday. Womenare 
frightened to report it simply for 
fear of future, more violent acts. 

So, what can a woman do 
when faced with this situation? 
Admitto yourselfthat you are being 
abused. (Beatings are not done out 
of love.) Make sure that you have a 
place to go in an emergency. Know 
that number of the police 
department. Most importantly, see 
a doctor. Your injuries may be worse 
than you think. If you are in a 
relationship such as this, GET OUT 
NOW!

As the promotional and 
entertainment coordinator, 
Godwin makes up the creative side 
of 7N7 Productions. His friend 
and fellow Sigma Chi, Chris 
Buerger, handles the business side 
of the small enterprise. The two 
have been in business for a little 
over two years now. 

though. I think most students 
would have a better college 
experience if a place like this 
existed: 

Godwin ' s own college 
experience is drawing to a close. He 
is currently in his final quarter. 
Having pledged in the spring of his 
freshman year, his membership in 
Sigma Chi has spanned over three 
years.

Tenacious Triton Tennis: A Weekend Racket 
MEN: Four players advance to second round of S.D. tourney WOMEN: Roll over Redlands, 8-1, for second victory of year 
By Hilary Somera 
Guardian Reporter 

You would have thought the UCSD men's 
tennis team had seen enough of the Univer-
si ty of San Diego after a Jan. 2810s5, but those 

persevering Tritons 
were at it again. 

I nvi ted back to 
USD for the San Diego 
Intercollegiate Tour-
ney last weekend , 
UCSD 'put Division I 
schools in their place. 

Triton Robert Ho 
played in the top-two 
singles fligh, and was 
beaten back, 6·2, 6·) . 
I n his consolation 
match , however, he 
closed out one of UC 

Santa Barbara's top players, 9-7. In Ho's third 
match of the day, his Redlands opponent wore 
him down, 6·3, 4-6, 6·0. 

UCSD's Frank Heeb handily defeated his 
first-round opponent from Cal Lutheran, 6-3, 
6-4. But this confidence booste r was not 
enough. Heeb was unable to overcome his San 

5 part time positions 
earning $10 hr. up to 

$250 per week.

Diego State opponent, slipping 6-3, 6-3. 
Dan Brounstein had a huge first-round win 

agai nst the sixth seed from Pacific, crushing 
him, 6-3,6-1. But Brounstein couldn't keep 
up with his next opponent from SDSU, fail-
ing 6-2, 6-2. 

UCSD's Mike Wilson took care of his first-
round Cal Lutheran opponent, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 
but in the second round Wilson fell to the sec-
ond seed from Pacific, 7-6, 6-1. 

Triton freshman Ping Yeh proved his col-
legiate tennis abilities this weekend. Yeh made 
it to the semi-finals of his flight before los-
ing, 6-3, 6-2. Emilian Miliet also stepped it 
up, knocking off a Division I opponent from 
Loyola Marymount, 3-6, 6-0, 6-3. 

UCSD's Ari Marken caught a bit of bad 
luck, drawing the number-one seed from the 
University of Pacific and eventually losing, 
6-3,6-2. 

It was a short weekend of doubles for the 
Tri tons. All four teams got rocked early by 
tough first-round draws. 

"This was a great tournament for us. It is 
remarkable that four players made it past the 
first round," Turner said. "Everyone played 
well." 

By D.n Sweeney 
Staff Writer 

Eight and one must be the UCSD Women's 
Tennis Team's magic numbers. The Tritons 
(2-0) hit the road on Saturday and felled host 

Redlands 8-1, the 
same score by which 
they defeated Long 
Beach State two 
weeks ago. 

The match was a 
first in one regard: It 
introduced a new for· 
mat, in which doubles 
matches are played 
via pro sets as op-
posed to the tradi-
tional best of three. 
The only noticeable 
result of the new for-

mat was that UCSD buried its opponents that 
much quicker. 

" It was nice playing with the new format ," 
Head Coach Liz laPlante said. " It shortened 
the match quite a bit which is the purpose 
behind it." 

Other than the new scoring, it was busi-

ness as usual for the Tritons. 
Sophomore stalwart Michelle 

Malephansukal was in the middleofit all. Af-
ter shutting out Buyak-Sveveman, 8-0, at the 
top doubles spot with partner Miki Kurokawa, 
she dispatched the number-one singles oppo-
nent with similar ease, 6-0, 6-1. 

Kurokawa was equally dominating at her 
number-four slot, winning 6-0, 6-1. 

As always there was no letting up through-
out the formidable Triton lineup. Number-two 
Hilary Somers blanked her counterpart 6-0, 
6-0. Suzy Drage, who is settling in nicely at 
the third slot, dismantled her adversary 6-1, 
6-2. Yumi Takemoto, holding down the sixth 
spot, reduced her opponent by the same 6-1, 
6-2 score. 

The only loss for the Tritons came at the 
fifth spot, where Morgan Gessford absorbed 
a 2-6, 6-0, 6-4 defeat. After completely domi-
nating the first set, she let up enough in the 
second for her opponent to get back in it and 
eventually win. 

Drage-Somers were successful in the 
doubles arena, however, winning 8-1. To 
round out doubles scoring, Gessford-
Takemoto defeated Clark-Hasegawa 8-3.

W.HOOPS: 
Tritons feel lucky 
Continued from pale 18 
Henricks, When time finally ran oul, 
the Tritons accompanied their 13th 
victory with a sigh of relief, 

"We are glad to escape with this 
win," Malone said, "I'm just going 
to keep on knocking on wood," 

Among the other statistical lead-
ers for UCSD was Oviatt, who tal-
lied 10 points to complement her 
great performance on the boards, 
where she pulled down 14 on the 
evening, It was the inside play of 
Oviatt and Jungwirth that made the 
difference in the game for the Tri-
tons, whose traditionally strong 
long·distance shooters were firing 
blanks (0 for 11 to be exact). 

"We are starting to get the ball 
into them more," Malone said, 
~They really made the difference the 
other night [against Pt, Loma] also," 

It was the victory over Pt. Loma 
on Thursday night which propelled 
UCSD into the match-up against 
Chapman on a three·game tear. 

Trailing by nine points in the sec-
ond half, the Tritons did not quit and 
came roaring back to life, eventu-
ally tying the contest up with eight 
minutes to go and setting up some 
last·minute dramatics, 

Pt, Loma tied the contest at 67 
with 1 :30 to play on a three-pointer 
by Robin Blaylock, UCSD didn 't 
take a timeout and brought the ball 
up court, looking for the lead , 
Henricks delivered, aggressively 
driving down the heart ofPt, Loma's 
defense and scoring the basket 
which put the Tritons up for good, 

A free throw by Jungwirth with 
six seconds remaining in the game 
gave UCSD a three·point edge, and 
a desperation heave by Pt. Loma 
wasn't even close as the Tritons 
cameback for a 70-67 victory, 

"We are much better at not get-
ling rattled [when we're down]," 
Malone said, "We are playing very 
well for as young as we are," 

MaHOOPS: 
UCSD bites Panthers 
Continued from pace 20 
only 15 turnovers overall 
UCSD 's confidence was brimming. 

This Triton assurance continued 
to show itself as the second half 
began, A 13-point UCSD halftime 
lead immediately ballooned to a 19· 
point margin because of red-hot 37 
of71 (,520) shooting from the field, 

"Everyone contributed," 
Lanthier said, "It was the first game 
this year where we as a team played 
up to our ability," 

Some opportune points from 
downtown (13 treys total) and nifty 
inside work by center Mall Aune 
(t 7 points) kept UCSD comfortable 
for most of the second half, 

"[Aune] has improved a lot. He's 
a little quicker". and he's in much 
better shape than he was at the be· 
ginning of the year," Lanthier said, 

Chapman kept the Tritons hon-
est, however, closing to within five 
with 1 ;30 left in the game, It was 
then a race to the finish - a test to 
see which team could hit the most 
free throws before time expired, 

And when it was all over, the Tri· 
ton pressure defense had beld fast. 
UCSD walked away with an upset 
victory, one step closer to an even 
record. 

"A great team effort like this one 
is a lot of fun, We continue to im-
prove," Lanthier said, "[A ,500 
record] is attainable,"

four-leaf clo-
vers tied in her 
hair, horseshoes 
hanging from 
her pockels and 
her fingers 
crossed. 

The Tritons 
have been 
hanging onto 
the hope of 
making the 
playoffs by the 

slimmesl of margins. Simply put, 
they need to win to ens.ure them-
selves a place amongst the nation's 
Division III elite. 

If they cannot win the remain-
der of their games, then it will be 
up 10 the NCAA committee to de-
termine their fale - and no one 
wants 10 leave it in their hands. 

Taml Oviatt had 10 points and collected 14 rebounds In the win. 

UCSD (13-5) has been doing its 
job, though, earning its fourth-con-
secutive victory on Saturday night 
by downing a Chapman squad, 53-
47. The Tritons showed a great deal 
of poise in the contest, withstand-
ing a second-half ru-n by the Pan-
thers 10 hold on for the victory. 

UCSD marched into the half 
with a six-poinl cushion, 28-22, but 
when the second stanza began, 
Chapman was on the attack. The 

Panthet:S chipped away at the Tri-
tons ' lead until Carrie Glodt made 
a layup that knotted Ihe contest at 
34 wilh just over 12 minutes to go. 

For a brief period, UCSD was 
baUling small deficits; however, it 
wasn't long before Ihe Tritons 
surged to Ihe fore once again. Tami 
Oviatt put UCSD back in front when 
she converted an inside hoop on a 
sweel dish from guard Amy Franzen 
to make the score 42-40. 

The Tritons continued to extend 
their advantage going up by four 
points when sophomore forward 
Sarah Schneider put the ball up and 

in on anolher beautiful dish, this 
lime from point guard Marcia 
Jeffries. 

Chapman called timeout to re-
group. Fortunately, the sliff UCSD 
defense prevented the Panlhers from 
making another run down the 
streich, because free-throw shooling 
for the Tritons was less than depend-
able (48 percent). UCSD eventually 
put the game away on an inside 
hoop from leading scorer Karli 
Jungwirth (11 points, nine re-
bounds) and a couple offree throws 
by Jungwirth and ~·ichelle

Tritons Take Tree to Five 
WINLESS: UCSD falls to Stanford and Pacific in a two-game home 
stretch and is still looking for its first win of the young season 
By Jeremy l't'Ialamed 
Staff Writer 

Another weekend of league com-
pelition has come and gone, and the 
UCSD men's volleyball team still 

fi nds itself 
searching for 
that elusive 
first victory. 

Second-
ranked 
Stanford came 
to town on Fri-
day night, and 
the University 
of the Pacific 
paid a visit to 
RIMAC on 

Saturday afternoon. The Tritons had 
high hopes for the two-game week-
end series. Bul disappointment 
struck Ihe young UCSD squad once 
again, as il dropped two straight, 
falling to 0-5 (0-4 in Mountain Pa-
cific Sports Federation games). 

Friday's match was Ihe much-
anticipated rematch agai nst Divi-
sion I powerhouse Stanford (4-1,1-
0). The legions of RIMAC fans who 
showed up were not disappointed. 
It was an intense, classic battle Ihat 
saw the Tritons fall inches short of 
pulling off another miracle upsel. 

UCSD got the crowd inlo the 
game early on, stunning Stanford by 
stealing game one 16-14. Stanford 
then roared back, handling the Tri-
tons easily en route to a 15-4 game-
two victory. The Cardinal seemed 
to be in control. 

But the Tritons were not ready 
to pack it in just yel. They put to-

gelher another courageous effort lacked focus. 
and made Ihe number-two team in 
America sweat it out, winning game 
Ihree, 15-13. 

Stanford cruised through game 
four, 15-2, setting up the climatic 
fifth game, to be played under rally 
scoring. The Tritons hung tough 
throughout the final bailie, staying 
close to Stanford and evenlually ty-
ing the match at 10-10. 

However, in the end, the 
Cardinal's tremendous height ad-
vantage Ihat proved to be too much 
for UCSD to handle. Six-foot, 10-
inch Brian Moore learned up with 
Mike Lambert (28 kills) 
to stymie the Trilons bid 
for an upsel, and Stanford 
look the match with a 15-
11 game five victory. 

"That was one of the 
biggest games I can re-
member playing in. It was 
a tough loss, but we put 
in a strong learn effort," 
UCSD's Tom Black said. 
"It was a physically 
draining match. We got 
up for game one ... [we 
were] drained for game 
two, and then we got up 
again for game three. It 
was an intense match." 

The Tritons hoped to 
rebound from Friday 
night's disappointment 
with a win against Pacific 
(3-2, 1-2) on Saturday. 
Bul with thoughts of the 
one that slipped away still 

Pacific left town with a four- sel 
victory, 15-4,9-15,15-7, 15-8, led 
by Malt SUllie, who recorded a 
game-high 23 kills. 

On the Triton side of the ball, 
Black recovered from his slow start 
this season with two huge games. 
He gave UCSD a spark of intensity 
by tallying 20 kills, to help his team 
hang close in the Stanford match. 

Black a1so played extremely well 
against Pacific, tallying 19 kills, 
while teammale Tyson Kerr contin-
ued his strong play with 33 kills 
over the weekend.

20 SPORTS 

RHHFTY 
DAN KRAFT 

What Next, Sf, 
Monopoly? 

I've always been very 
particular about the sports 
upon which I choose to bestow 
my all-important, omnipotent 
blessing. Sports which are 
truly deserving of being 
written about in the glamorous 
section of the local newspa-
pers. 

I'm from the John Madden 
school of thought on this i ue. 
You see, a sport is an activity 
which requires you to sweat. 
Sweat a great deal. Sweat so 
much that you can collect it in 
large, yellow buckets and 
justify sitting next to giant fans 
called "Mr. Coo\''' 

But there is a catch: This 
sweat must be purely because 
of physical activity, not mental 
strain. 

It was on a seemingly 
innocent day just two weeks 
ago that I received one of the 
greatest shocks of my life, 
while I was flipping through 
the pages of the holy book of 
the sporting community, Sports 
Illustrated. 

There I sat, non-chalantly 
browsing through the plethora 
of bold, full-color photos when 
I stumpled upon an article 
dedicated to that outcast of the 
sporting world: chess. 

Yes, chess had earned 
almost a page of high-quality 
press from the most esteemed 
publication in the sporting 
industry. In retrospect, I am 
amazed at the self-restraint 
that prevented me from caning 
up to cancel my subscription 
right then and there. 

This incident leads us to a 
disturbing question: What's 
next? Will Sf now grace its 
cover with the strained 
expressions from a heated 
match of Monopoly or 
Parchesi. 

For goodness sakes, this is 
ridiculous. These aren't sports, 
they're board games. They 
certainly don't meet the sweat-
through-physical exertion test 
of a true sport. John Madden 
would be appalled. 

What is this world coming 
to when men who never had to 
set foot in a weight room are 
honored in the sporting bible? 
If I ever see a full-page color 
photo depicting the awe-
inspiring atmosphere of the Pin 
Ball World Championships, I 
am certain I will lose my lunch 
all over that issue, and shortly 
thereafter, I will lose my 
subscription. 

After all, my self-restraint 
only goes so far.

Tritons Smash sec 
TWIN KILLING: Third-ranked UCSD began its season by sweeping a 
double-header from the Vanguards on Saturday afternoon, 16-4 and 8-6 
Sean Rahlml 
Guardian Reporter 

Everyone. was talking about the 
pitcher from Southern California 
College. lIa Borders was going to 

pitch in the sec-
ond game of a 
double-header 
against the Tri-
tons on Satur-
day afternoon, 
and an impa-
tient media en-
tourage awaited 
her arrival on 
the mound. The 
UCSD baseball 
team grabbed 

the spotlight, however, conquering 
the Vanguards by scores of 16-4 and 
8-6 to sweep t~e afternoon set and 
post its first two victories of the sea-
son. 

The Tritons opened their season 
by crushing SCC in the first game 
with an offense that roared and a 
defense that began sluggishly, al-
lowing four runs in the first two in-
nings before stiffening to prevent 
any further damage. 

Starter Steve Height (three Ks 
and no walks) gave up a quartet of 
runs in the first two innings because 
of what appeared to be a case of the 
first-game jitters. However, he 
settled down and shut out the Van-
guards the rest of the way with some 

help from the bull pen in the late 
going. 

"Steve is a really good pitcher. 
Everybody gets jitters. He and Ryan 
[Ward, who started game two], did 
a solid job," Head Coach Robert 
Fletcher said. "I thought we came 
out well. Everybody played very 
well." 

The Triton offensive machine 
manufactured five runs in both the 
first and fourth innings to put the 
game away early. Craig Birk (2-3, 
three runs and four RBIs) ignited the 
team in the first inning when he un-
leashed a titanic three-run blast that 
cleared the right field scoreboard 
and brought UCSD back from a 2-0 
deficit. 

For the remainder of the game, 
the Tritons offensive fuel came from 
all over the field. Catcher AI 
DelFavero went three-for-five with 
a double and a pair of RBIs, while 
first baseman Dan O'Brien pitched 
in by driving home two runs on two 
doubles. Short stop Chris. Miyake 
did his part, notching a triple and 
scoring three runs in the contest. 

The Tritons ended the first game 
with 16 runs on 13 hits. To finish 
off a near-perfect afternoon, center 
fielder Jason Aguilar made an in-
credible diving catch on a slicing-
line drive into right-center field that 
clinched the victory. Unfortunately, 
Aguilar suffered an injury making 

the play. 
Ward threw the second game of 

the double header for the Tritons 
and was faced with the daunting 
task of facing off against the highly 
touted Borders. 

However, Ward and company 
were unphased and sent Borders 
packing by the fourth inning. The 
SCC southpaw started well, but 
could not hold off the Triton offen-
sive juggernaut. Her defense didn 't 
help either, committing four errors 
while she roamed the mound. 

"We go into every game with the 
same attitude. She is a decent 
pithcer and pitched well," said 
Fletcher. 

The Tritons broke the game open 
in the fourth inning, scoring three 
runs to take a 6-2 edge. UCSD was 
led by the efforts of Eric Quandt (4-
4, four runs) and Miyake (2-2, three 
RBis). DelFavero and Craig Birk 
also pitched in with two hits apiece. 
The Tritons made it interesting in 
the ninth, when the Vanguards 
closed the gap to 8-6 and had the 
bases loaded. But with the pressure 
on, Mark Hartmann charged out of 
the pen to save the day, striking out 
SCC's Josh Sewell with some 
wicked high heat to earn the save. 

"Everybody had a job to do and 
did it. I thought everyone chipped 
in when the team needed it," 
fletcher said.

game, for

Playing in 
the un -
friendly 
confines of 

Chapman University, the youth-
ful Triton hoopsters selected VIC-
tim number one, whalloping an 
experienced Panther squad, 102-
95. 

"To be honest, the game 
wasn't nearly as close as the 
score," UCSD Head Coach Greg 
Lanthier said. "They were reel-
ing most of the time." 

Chapman jumped out to an 
early six-point lead to start the 
contest, but UCSD quickly ral-
lied to make it 29-29 at mid-pe-
riod. 

"At one point, we went on a 
12-2 run and pulled away from 
them," Lanthier said . "We 
played some real aggressive ball, 
despite the fact we couldn't get 
a call all night." 

The UCSD offensive ma-
chine was paced by a consistent 
effort from all nine active play-
ers. Four members tallied 
double-figure point totals, led by 
high-scoring forward Matt 
Minehan (19 points). 

"I thought it was easily 
[Mineha(J's] best game of the 
year," Lanthier said. 

UCSD guard Todd Benetar 
(17 points) dropped in three treys 
to match Minehan's perfer-
mance, and teammate Kahlil 
Allen was his usual productive 
self, notching 18 points and three 
rebounds. 

The Tritons marched into the 
half, 59-46, feeling good about 
themselves. With their offense 
humming and rarely misfiring-
