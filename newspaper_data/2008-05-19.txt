In its new format, the Sun God 
Festival attracted the first-ever sold-
out crowd in its 26-year history, with 
A.S. programmers distributing and 
selling a total of 20,000 wristbands in 
the four days leading up to the May 
16 event.

By Thursday night, programmers 
had run out of entry wristbands for 
undergraduates and could only offer 
leftover guest admission at the price 
of $35. To conform to the capacity 
of RIMAC Field, the local fire mar-
shal capped the number of distribut-
able wristbands at 20,000. Festivals 
Coordinator Garrett Berg said about 
150 undergraduates were forced to 
purchase admission once wristband 
stocks had been depleted.

Earl Warren College senior 
Jonathan Guidry said he came to a 
location to pick up his wristband at 
6 p.m. on Thursday but was turned 
away because event staff had exhaust-
ed their supply.

“I had no idea that there were 
a limited number of wristbands,” 
Guidry said. “The [informational] 
pamphlet and Web site definitely 
have no mention of a limited number 
of undergraduate wristbands … all I 
wanted to do was support my friends 
performing on the Midway stage, but 
evidently A.S. doesn’t want me to do 
that.”

Berg said that the programming 
office plans to work with the fire 
department next year to increase the 
field’s capacity and the number of 
wristbands offered to students.

Aging UC Landmark in Need of Repair 

By Sarah de Crescenzo
Senior Staff Writer

The traditional home of the UC 
president — located just four miles 
north of the UC Berkeley campus 
— is in need of comprehensive 
repairs costing up to $9 million to 
make it a suitable living residence 
and meeting place, the UC Office 
of the President announced last 
week.

The three-story, 13,239-square-

foot home, known as Blake House, 
is currently undergoing a profes-
sional restoration assessment to 
determine if it will or can be used 
again to house the UC president. 
Although departing UC President 
Robert C. Dynes has been living in 
Blake House for the past five years, 
university officials have concluded 
that the house is no longer fit for 
use as a residence.

Blake House has suffered from 
years of deferred maintenance, and 
its location on an active geological 
slide has led to foundation prob-
lems that have caused problematic 
roofing and wall conditions, UCOP 
spokesman Paul Schwartz said. 
Schwartz added that due to the UC

UCSD administrators are cur-
rently reviewing the proposed Staff 
and Academic Reduction in Time 
program, a plan proposed by the 
University of California Office of the 
President on May 6 as a temporary 
means of helping the university cope 
with approaching state budget cuts.

The goal of S.T.A.R.T. is to 
achieve salary savings from tem-
porary and voluntary reductions in 
work time by eligible employees. 

According to Judy Johnson, 
chief of staff for Vice Chancellor of 
Business Affairs Steven W. Relyea, 

the feedback has been positive since 
S.T.A.R.T. was proposed.

“Respondents have expressed 
interest in the proposed program,” 
Johnson said.

The program’s parameters pro-
vide that any full- and part-time 
nonprobationary staff employees 
and academic appointees, with the 
exception of faculty and student 
academics and postdoctoral schol-
ars, would be eligible to voluntarily 
reduce their work time.

faculty, student appointees, medical 
residents and research appointees

Until restoration efforts 
are complete, future UC 
president Mark G. Yudof 
won’t occupy the historic 
presidential digs.

Study Identifies Link Between 
Vitamin D, Breast Cancer
Researchers at the UCSD’s 

Rebecca and John Moores Cancer 
Center have utilized new data on 
worldwide cancer incidence to 
show that a deficiency in sun-
light exposure, specifically ultra-
violet B, increases the chances of 
developing breast cancer.

UVB exposure triggers pho-
tosynthesis of vitamin D3, which 
is also available through diet and 
supplements, in the body.

“This is the first study, to our 
knowledge, to show that higher 
serum levels of vitamin D are 
associated with reduced inci-
dence rates of breast cancer 
worldwide,” Cedric F. Garland, 
professor of family and preven-
tive medicine at the UCSD School 
of Medicine and Moores Cancer 
center member, said in a state-
ment. “Even after controlling for 
known variables such as meat, 
vegetable and alcohol intake, 
cigarette consumption, weight, 
fertility and others, the inverse 
association of modeled vitamin-D 
status with breast cancer inci-
dence remained strong.”

The study, which is pub-
lished in this month’s issue of the 
Breast Journal, uses a new tool 
developed by the World Health 
Organization’s International 
Agency for Research on Cancer 
called GLOBOCAN to access a 
worldwide database of cancer 
incidence, mortality and preva-
lence for 175 countries.  

The study’s authors said that 
this was an analysis of countries 
rather than individuals and find-

ings that relate to countries may 
not apply to individuals.

Every year, an estimated 1.15 
million people develop breast can-
cer worldwide, resulting in about 
410,000 deaths. Approximately 
215,000 new cases and 41,000 
deaths occur in the United 
States.

Berkeley Senior Dies After 
Falling From Roof

UC Berkeley student Alan 
Hamai was found dead after fall-
ing from the roof of his three-story 
house this past weekend.  

Police are still investigating 
whether Hamai’s death was an 
accident, Berkeley police officer 
Lyle Ledward said in a statement. 
He added that alcohol may have 
been involved in the incident.  

Hamai, who was a 22-year-old  
anthropology major, had attended 
his graduation ceremony the day 
before his body was discovered 
by a pedestrian in the front yard of 
his house early on May 17.  

“Considering everything that 
has happened, there is an inves-
tigation by homicide detectives,” 
Ledward said in a statement, in 
reference to the recent homicides 
that have occurred in the Berkeley 
area.

Berkeley resident Maceo 
Smith was shot and killed May 13 
near Hamai’s residence, and UC 
Berkeley student Chris Wootton 
was fatally stabbed near the Chi 
Omega sorority house on May 3. 

“There is no evidence to sug-
gest foul play at this point, no sign 
of a struggle,” police Sgt. Mary 
Kusmiss said in a statement.

system’s tight budget and Dynes’ 
occupation, only minor repairs 
have been made recently.

“Over the past several years, 
Blake House has undergone 
approximately $130,000 in minor 
repairs such as painting and patch-
ing roof leaks, but no comprehen-
sive repairs,” Schwartz said. 

The findings of the restoration 
assessment will be made available 
to the UC Board of Regents in sev-
eral months, according to univer-
sity officials. The assessment will 
then be used to determine if the 
house will serve as home to future 
UC presidents or be utilized for 
other university activities.

Due to its condition, incom-
ing UC President Mark G. Yudof 
will not live in the house, which 
has been home to a number of UC 
presidents and their families since 
1969. Instead, the Yudof family will 
be housed in a 6,800-square-foot 
residence in Oakland, for which the 
UC Office of the President autho-
rized a two-year lease last week. 

The lease for Yudof ’s house and 
its furnishings will be $11,360 per 
month, and will increase to $11,750 
per month in the second year. In 
addition, university officials expect 
around $2,025 per month to be put 
toward utilities, gardening, garbage 
collection and other such services.

The house will serve both as the 
Yudof private residence and as a 
site for official university events.

The money to repair the Blake 
House would come from a pri-
vate endowment of donated funds, 
Schwartz said.

mers corralled all council-sponsored activities 
onto RIMAC Field, where students ate food pro-
vided by vendors, scaled rock-climbing walls and 
watched concert acts. Berg said that the single-
location layout was easier to manage.

“Our approach to safety was to offer as much 
activity as possible,” Berg said. “We believed that 
people would control their behavior if they had 
enough to do and things to see. It’s when there’s 
nothing to do that when disorderly people go into 
a free-for-all.”

Three hundred and fifty five people — 197 
students and 158 nonaffiliates — were arrested 
or cited at last year’s Sun God, with almost all of 
the incidents being alcohol-related. Berg reported 
preliminary numbers that were drastically lower at 
this year’s festival, where approximately 60 people 
were cited or arrested by 9 p.m. Friday night.

“The authorities were ready and we were 
ready,” Berg said of his staff, which also included 
numerous staff and faculty volunteers. “Tons of 
festivals work easier because it is easier to super-
vise within one space.”

The campus was nearly bare elsewhere during 
the day, with traditional festival activities either 
relocated or eliminated. The descending fountain 
in Price Center, where students have enjoyed a 
festival ritual of bubble baths, was cordoned off 
by caution tape. Security also tried to block the 
slip-and-slide attraction customarily hosted on 
Sun God Lawn by the campus’ satirical publica-
tion the Koala.

Berg said that the event’s new format promot-
ed a more controlled, festival-like ambiance than 
in previous years, allowing students to better enjoy 
the half-day experience on RIMAC Field.

“With the number of attractions and activities 
available, we were able to establish a true festival 
atmosphere that connected to the UCSD student,” 
he said. 

Campus programmers are ecstatic about the 
success of the festival’s new setup, Berg said. 

“It has been an incredibly long and difficult 
process to rebuild this festival from scratch,” he 
said. “But the process has officially produced 
the most-attended Sun God Festival ever. We’ve 
solidified the new festival, so it can only grow 
from here.”

are also included among those eli-
gible to participate in the program.

Under the program, eligible 
employees may volunteer to reduce 
their work time by 10 to 50 percent 
for as little as one month to a max-
imum of two years. Additionally, 
employees may participate in 
S.T.A.R.T. more than once, provided 
that participation is finished by the 
program’s conclusion at the end of 
June 2010.

Participating employees would 
earn vacation time, sick leave and 
UC Retirement Plan service credits 
on a month-by-month basis at the 
same rates they did prior to the 
commencement of S.T.A.R.T. They 
would also be eligible to receive 
UCRP benefits.

Participants would have to 
remain on pay status for a mini-
mum of 50-percent time so that 
benefits remain unaffected. Any 
greater reduction would negatively 
impact employee benefits such as 
medical and dental insurance, the 
status of which would otherwise be 
unchanged by S.T.A.R.T.

Despite optimism about the plan 
from university officials, not all eli-
gible emlpoyees share a similar out-
look. Philosophy graduate student 
Tim Jankowiak, who serves as a 
teaching assistant in the humani-
ties department, said the program 
appears especially unappealing to 
those in his position.

“I don’t have much a of a sense 
of whether it would be popular,” 

Participants Would Receive Same Benefits
▶ S.T.A.R.T., from page 1 Jankowiak said. “I doubt many 

grad students would go for it. I 
wouldn’t.” 

Jankowiak added that university 
officals should consider seeking 
budgetary solutions in other ways.

“It might be nice if the university 
could give individual departments 
more encouragement and assis-
tance in seeking private donations,” 
Jankowiak said.

All S.T.A.R.T. participants are 
required to obtain approval from 

the appropriate department head 
and sign a contract that stipulates 
the amount of time that will be 
reduced throughout the course of 
their participation in the program. 
Early termination of the contract by 
either the head of the department 
or the participant requires a 30-day 
notice of intent to withdraw from 
participation.

With the implementation of 
S.T.A.R.T., concerns have been 
expressed about the amount of work 
that would be redistributed among 

employees, particularly those who 
are exempt from the program, 
Johnson said.

“Although exempt employees are 
normally expected to work their 
appointment percentage, greater 
emphasis is placed on meeting the 
responsibilities of the employee’s 
position than on working a speci-
fied number of hours,” the UCOP 
program proposal states. “For this 
reason, it is important that super-
visors make appropriate workload 
adjustments for exempt employees 
who participate in S.T.A.R.T.”

This is not the only proposal 
targeting the problem of the univer-
sity’s looming budget cuts. Johnson 
said the program is arbitrary, and 
therefore does not guarantee any 
specific dollar amount that the uni-
versity might be expected to save.

“The amount of salary savings 
achieved is directly related to the 
number of employees who decide to 
participate in the program,” Johnson 
said.

At this time, all UC campuses are 
reviewing the proposed program.  
After the review period, UCSD is 
due to submit comments to UCOP 
by June 6.

If approved, S.T.A.R.T. would be 
enacted as of July 1 this year, and 
may be extended through June 30, 
2010, at the discretion of respective 
UCSD department heads, chairs and 
vice chancellors.

OPINION

Love it or hate it? How Sean Kingston, Coheed 
and Co. completely changed Sun God culture.

WILL PARSON/GUARDIAN

By Charles Nguyen
Senior Staff Writer

STUDENT LIFE — Believe it or not, Sean 
Kingston’s performance at the Sun God 
Festival this year can teach us all something 
about the new format of the event and what 
it means to its 25-year history.

With his nighttime set, the super-sized 
darling of Top-40 R&B attracted what 
Festivals Coordinator Garrett Berg called one 
of the largest crowds in Sun God’s history. 
The strong showing disproved preliminary 
predictions that Kingston, a new-age reggae 
artist with relatively specialized following, 
would crash and burn on stage in front of a 
lackluster crowd. The former was certainly 
true, with Kingston demanding sing-alongs 
with little response and committing what 
showmen could consider a mortal sin; his 
staple single “Beautiful Girls” was purposely 
cut off to make way for a record-label protege 
who trounced and bounced around stage to 

an unenthused 
crowd. (Tip: 
Don’t interrupt 
one of the few 
crowd-pleasing 
ditties you have 
in your already 
short musical 
repertoire with 
a worse act.)

So the question is: What magical formula 
brings big crowds to a bad act? Programming’s 
formula has been a year in the making, sub-
stituting concert acts with students as the fes-
tival’s centerpiece and relocating everything 
onto RIMAC Field. This year, it was hard to 
not be caught in awe by A.S. programming’s 
final product, the culmination of their year-
long effort to rebuild the festival from scratch. 
Maybe it was the crowds, which packed nearly 
every center of activity from the grassy seat-
ing areas to the street fair dubbed Sun God 
Avenue. Or it could have been the seemingly 

endless barrage 
of activities, 
which began 
its 12-hour run 
at noon. By 
Saturday morn-
ing, the festival 
was deemed 
successful from 
nearly every 

angle, breaking attendance records for both 
undergraduates and nonaffiliates. 

Programmers deserve credit for an 
intensely involving process; this year, they 
had to reinvent, popularize and manage a 
larger festival. But they have unavoidably 
failed at preservation, because the Sun God 
as we knew it is dead.

The crowds that once lined Library Walk 
were gone. No one was playing with bubbles 
in Price Center’s fountain. The entire day 
saw little life buzzing around campus. Koala
members trying to host the annual slip-and-

slide had to duck authorities throughout the 
morning.

So this is the eulogy to Sun God as we 
knew it — but how long should the grieving 
process be? Upperclassmen like me are shed-
ding tears; the new festival is a gaudy Triton 
carnival that ropes all the fun into one area. 
But it’s a shorter funeral for newer Tritons, 
who will undoubtedly enjoy their safer, more 
organized experience.

Whatever formula, strategy or technique 
programmers utilized, its continued use 
bodes well for a festival that — at the begin-
ning of this year — was tied to a whipping 
post and flogged for its unsafe and unman-
aged impact on the campus. A year’s worth of 
negotiations, debriefings and discussions has 
given programmers what they had planned 
all along: a bigger festival that students that 
gather around.

Sun God MVPs: Speedo Champs, Gorillas and Legends
So the much-anticipated new Sun God Festival finally went down last Friday, and I’m sad 
to say the toned-down day definitely 
did not meet the expectations of this 
seasoned Sun-God-goer. 

I can see why administrators 
would love the new format — it 
herds students to one highly moni-
tored section of campus. But Sun 
God isn’t about administrators. It’s 
the one day for students to truly let 
loose. 

And traditionally, it’s been an 
epic day of debauchery and drunk-
enness; a day made of free food and 
loud music; a day of dancing in a 
bubble-filled Price Center foun-
tain and skipping past the box-
car derby; a day when even the 
quietest coeds can shout “Happy 
Sun God!” to a passing stranger; a 
day of unapologetic cheer when all 
22,000 Tritons are out in full force, 
bedazzled and beaming on every 
bit of campus. 

It was the stuff of legends. A 
day that every incoming freshman 
eagerly awaited, that every upper-
classman marked ceremoniously on 
his calendar and that every grocery 
and liquor store owner could count 
on to clear his stock.

But Friday saw our beloved fes-
tival brutally castrated by the Sun 
God Planning Committee, with 
most students falling unfortunately 
into the trap. It looks like UCSD’s 
higher-ups are looking to squelch 
this last, passionate blast of spirit 
and community, and it’s clearly up 
to students to make Sun God the 
amazing event that it can be. 

So this column goes out to all the 
Sun God 2008 MVPs, who took a 
bold stand in the name of tradition 
and did what they could to keep the 
celebration lively. 

1. Mad props to the Speedo-ed 
heroes who wouldn’t take “no Sun 
God Lawn booths” for an answer, 
stopping at nothing to engineer a 

giant blue-tarp slip-and-slide for all 
to enjoy. These fine gentlemen pro-
vided a classic midday adventure for 
students who stripped down to their 

bathing suits and skivvies to take 
the slippery plunge.

2. Also, a big shout out to all the 
grassrooters, who did what they 

could to keep the party pump-
ing. This means all the people who 
started spontaneous dance parties 
like those at Foodworx and KSDT. 
And all the decked-out under-
grads who took festival attire to 
new heights, most notably the girl 
dressed as a tree and the guy who 
wore a full-blown gorilla costume 
all day. We count on people like 
you to keep the day’s energy going; 
all you decorated, dancing beauties 
deserve a big high-five for helping 
to bring the impulsive flair back to 
our favorite bird.

3. And finally, the Living 
Legends and the crowd at their 
show deserve some big recogni-
tion. The crowd is an essential part 
of this MVP award, because you 
guys embraced the Legends and 
all they stand for, laughing in the 
faces of administrators and secu-
rity and indulging in Sun God’s 
oldest pillar — inebriation. (That 
festive odor wafting through the 

audience definitely wasn’t incense.) 
Not only were the Legends hands 
down the best afternoon act to 
begin with, they’re great perform-
ers who really understood the 
event — Sun God isn’t the place 
to see your favorite band, you just 
need music to get your hands up 
and your hips low — and they kept 
the beats bumping and rhythms 
flowing accordingly. 

So to all the MVPs, and the 
other champs I might have missed: 
Thank you. For you, my friends, 
are the character and life of Sun 
God and I sincerely hope to see 
you out and about next year, doing 
what ya do.

My Cairo apartment has defi-nitely fallen into disrepair. Well, not exactly disrepair, 
but it has seen better days — and my 
roommate Wesley Horne and I are 
getting ready to move out. Our lease 
ends on May 26, a day before the last 
day of classes here at the American 
University in Cairo, and we have started 
to worry about get-
ting our sizeable 
security deposit, 
a whopping 1,700 
Egyptian pounds 
($300), back from 
our landlord.

We originally 
moved in because 
of the area’s local 
charm. The apartment is located in 
the middle of a small web of alleyways 
between the two major roads harboring 
the AUC campus. Just up our tiny street 
is a subsidized bakery where neighbors 
come from all over the area to buy 
bread through a small window at prices 
drastically below production cost. The 
mornings are usually filled with shouts 
contesting anything from a neighbor 
cutting in the line to the outlet not 
selling more than five loaves — each 
the size of a pita bread piece — per 
individual.

At midday, vendors clamor up the 
road calling out their services in chant 
and banging on all sorts of utensils to 
call attention to their products. I have 
no idea what they’re selling, or if anyone 
does, but they pass every day nonethe-
less. The alley around the corner is used 
as a chop shop where old cars are torn 
apart and run-down Frankensteined 
models are created. 

We knew we wanted to move in to 
9 Haret Selim, and we didn’t even mind 
living below the day-care center on the 
second floor, but we were a little wor-
ried about paying a security deposit. 
If our experience in Egypt had taught 
us anything, it was that there was little 
chance we would be getting our money 

back, deserved or not.
For four months Horne and I have 

tolerated our landlord Amar and her 
son knocking on our door in the middle 
of the night to ask us to pay random 
bills. Sometimes it was 20 pounds for 
stairwell cleaning, and other times it was 
grossly overpriced 100 pounds for elec-
tricity. Occasionally they simply offer to 

clean our carpets 
(for a price) and 
once a month they 
ask for rent, usu-
ally before the due 
date. We decided 
to put off paying 
the last month, and 
bargain for our 
deposit. 

Amar protested against using our 
deposit as rent and her English-speak-
ing son Kareem insisted it was illegal 
and impossible — affirming our fears 
that we would not see our money again. 
There was only one solution: we had to 
buy a baby camel and leave it in our liv-
ing room by the time we left.

The cheapest camel sold at the mar-
ket is about 2,000 Egyptian pounds, 
and that camel will likely be in pretty 
rough shape after traveling up the Darb 
El-Arbein, the 40 Days Road, from 
Omdurman, Sudan, to the Birqash 
Camel market 35 kilometers northwest 
of Cairo.  Although the camel’s route is 
a little easier today — it takes 30 days 
instead of 40 — the name remains, and 
the 775-mile journey mostly through 
the desert begins near the capital of 
Sudan, Khartoum, and ends in Darwa, 
a city in southern Egypt.

From the camel market in Darwa, 
the unpurchased animals are trucked 
up to Cairo. The quality of these 
camels tends to be sub-par. Hobbled 
and herded, many are covered with 
the marks of a harsh desert trek and 
scarred from discipline or scuffles with 
other camels, which have a fierce pro-
pensity for biting. 

We did have a few reservations about 

purchasing a camel for our apartment. 
Of course, spending 2,000 pounds in 
response to not receiving 1,700 seemed 
a bit irrational. But irrationality is what 
we were looking for in our vengeance. 
More important were the logistics of 
actually getting a baby camel into our 
apartment.

Camels are not a common sight in 
Abdeen, the neighborhood where we 
live. Perhaps in the past, the nearby 
Abdeen Palace — which is now princi-
pally used as a museum — saw visitors 
arriving by camel, but these days trans-
porting the pet would definitely draw 
attention on the midtown Cairo streets. 
Even if we could manage to hire a 
truck and get the camel to our door, 
up the stairs and through our cramped 
entryway, we would have a camel in our 
living room. Camels are significantly 
more work than cats, or the tiny purple 

beta fish named Hamagi that has lived 
in a whiskey bottle on our coffee table 
all semester. Despite our reservations, 
we still needed to go to the market and 
try our luck. 

Only open from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. 
on Fridays, the Birqash Camel Market 
was also difficult to travel to for penny-
pinching American students. At just 
after 6 a.m., Horne and I met with 
Brigid Grund and two other friends 
at our apartment and hailed a cab 
out on the main street. After a quick 
debate on our way to Imbaba, where the 
“Lonely Planet: Egypt” travel guide had 
informed us we could catch a minibus 
to the market, we decided to take the 
cab driver’s offer of 40 pounds to drive 
us all the way. Seven minutes later, in 
Imbaba, he said we had arrived. The 
fare could have easily been 10 pounds, 
and he had clearly missed the news that 

the market had moved years ago. We 
handed him a 20 and headed toward 
the buses.

But there were no buses to Birqash. 
There apparently never were. “Lonely 
Planet” had tricked us. We hired a driver 
to take us to the market for 50 pounds, 
which quickly jumped to 70 when we 
asked him to wait for two more people. 
The driver said he knew where the mar-
ket was; he didn’t.

The market was opening when we 
set off out of Imbaba and along a Nile 
Delta backroad. The city quickly faded 
into lush green vegetation and palms. 
Purple Jacaranda trees dotted the thin 
brown canal and added contrast to the 
colors of farming. Our driver slowed 
frequently, either to avoid potholes in 
the dirt motorway or to ask passing

farmers on donkey carts how to get 
to Birqash. The answer was always, 
“Straight ahead.”

Finally, sometime around 8 a.m., 
we arrived. We had passed through 
mile upon mile of date farms and 
wetlands, Nile Delta suburban towns 
and eventually rocky desert wasteland. 
It was in this last terrain where the 
corpses of camels could be seen pep-
pering the highway. 

Our journey was a short one. The 
camels that greeted us as we entered 
the market had traveled much fur-
ther and it showed; some were scarred 
and fatigued. Others were lively and 
endured fierce canings when they 
broke from the crowd. Some of the 
huge, awkward-looking, aggressive 
beasts snapped their jaws at the herd, 
clamping onto elongated necks.

It was only an instant before we 
realized our hopes of dragging one 
home to the disdain of our landlady 

were far from achievable. It took a 
mere 20 minutes before the novelty 
wore off and the herders’ harsh disci-
pline became too much. We could only 
see a camel whipped with a large stick 
so many times before we wished they 
would use other means to keep them 
out of the main causeway.

We left the market at 9:30 a.m. My 
roommate had discussed prices and 
casually chatted with sellers — not with 
the intention of buying, but because we 
had come with hope and needed to see 
it through, if only half-heartedly.

Still stung from the overpriced ride 
out to Birqash, we climbed into the 
back of a truck and for 10 pounds rode 
to the nearby train station, which was 
nearly empty when we arrived. It was 
hardly more than a cement platform 
along the tracks. We each paid a pound 
for our tickets and were told the train 
would arrive in 30 minutes.

At 12:30 p.m. we boarded the third-
class train and spent the next hour and 

a half chatting or drifting in and out 
of sleep. The train stopped, or only 
slowed to let people hop off and on, 
at countless small stations along the 
trip back to the city. We paid another 
pound each for the metro home and 
made our way a few blocks back to 
the apartment. We slowly crept up the 
stairs, hoping to not attract the atten-
tion of our landlady. The camel market 
had not been a success, but it was an 
adventure. 

Besides, we can always just draw on 
the walls we paid to have painted, or 
steal the sink faucet we repaired our-
selves. We could even collect dozens 
of Cairo’s stray cats and give them a 
temporary home. Or we could suck it 
up. After all, it was cheaper to live here 
for five months than to rent a place for 
one in San Diego.

also be a part of the 4x400 relay 
team, joining Merrill, senior Corey 
Sheredy and sophomore Anna Lee 
McGregor. Knudson will also join 
a handful of her teammates in run-
ning in the 100-meter hurdles. 

UCSD’s lone participant in 
the pole-vaulting event is senior 
Christina Sloyer, just as junior 
thrower Sarah Hendy will be the 
only Triton in the discus competi-
tion. Junior jumper Leah Murphy 
will join Johnson in the long jump as 
the pair tries to earn UCSD a clean 
sweep of the event. Rounding out the 
Triton squad at nationals is fresh-
man multi-event runner Stephanie 
LeFever in the heptathlon. 

Having such a range of partici-
pants in so many events gives UCSD 

the rare opportunity to score points 
across the board in order to compile 
a total big enough to earn them a 
top finish.

“On the national level it’s about 
just having a good meet and put-
ting together a couple of good days,” 
Salerno said. “We’re glad to have this 
many people going; most programs 
only have about one-and-a-half ath-
letes per average going to nationals. 
So we’re real happy with how many 
people we have [at nationals] so hope-
fully that will give us a good chance.”

The Tritons have never broken 
the top 10 as a team at the NCAA 
National Championships, but appear 
to be in fantastic position to make 
2008 a banner year for the UCSD 
track and field program. In her 
first season as the head coach of 

the women’s team, Darcy Ahner has 
the chance to establish the Tritons’ 
rightful place among the best in the 
nation. With so many phenomenal 
athletes representing UCSD at the 
national finals, there is no reason that 
the national championships cannot 
be the springboard for the Tritons, 
sending them soaring to the upper 
echelons of collegiate competition.

“We’ve been through so many of 
these [national meets] that it’s really 
just a chance for the athletes to show 
what they’ve got,” Salerno said. “We 
want to have a few good days and for 
things to go our way. It’s been a great 
year no matter what, so this would 
just be icing on the cake.”

Streaking Panthers End Tritons’ Run
By Neil Joshi
Staff Writer

MEN’S TENNIS — The No. 18 Tritons 
saw their season come to an end in 
Houston on May 14, losing 5-2 to 
No. 4 Drury University in a Sweet-16 
encounter. The team finished its sea-
son at 11-12 after playing a schedule 
filled with Division-I opponents and 
top-notch teams from Division II. The 
Panthers have been on a roll through-
out the season; they improved to 24-2 
for the year and have gone 18 consecu-
tive matches since their last loss. 

Despite their opponent’s intimi-
dating streak, the Tritons came out 
firing, starting strong in doubles to 
grab an early lead, but the Panthers’ 
dominating singles play secured their 
spot in the Elite Eight. UCSD showed 
it could compete at the Panthers’ 
level for long stretches, but couldn’t 
sustain it long enough to pull off the 
upset victory.

“We played good doubles and aver-
age singles and lost to a good team,” 
head coach Eric Steidlmayer said. “We 
competed hard today but in the end 
didn’t improve enough during the sea-
son to win here in the tournament.” 

UCSD’s tournament run began 
with a bye in the first round that set 
up a second round matchup against 
Brigham Young University-Hawaii. 
The Tritons looked strong in defeating 
their West Region rivals 5-0, which 
earned them a trip to Texas, where the 
rest of the tournament took place.

In doubles, UCSD raced to an early 
2-1 lead, winning at No. 1 and No. 3. 
At the top doubles position, senior 
Eric Rubens teamed with sophomore 
Alex Placek to upend Drury’s team 
of Stefan Borg and Nikola Prpic 8-6. 
It was quite a victory for UCSD’s top 
doubles pair since Borg and Prpic 

were the nation’s fourth-ranked dou-
bles team. The Panthers evened the 
score at the second doubles position, 
with Nahom Serekeberhan and Florian 
Perche defeating UCSD’s senior Alex 
Whitmore and junior Kazumi Negishi. 
Whitmore and Negishi struggled to 
get any kind of rhythm going and 
lost by an 8-1 score. Sophomore Bijan 
Moallemi and freshman Erik Elliott 
managed to get the Tritons back in 
front, concluding doubles play with 
an impressive 8-5 win against Anton 
Khadasevich and Federico Levi.

Holding a lead entering singles, the 
Tritons were feeling optimistic about 
their chances of scoring a major upset 
and ending the Panthers’ long winning 
streak. 

“The guys were pumped and ready 
to go after the tremendous way we 
started things off in doubles,” Negishi 
said. “All year long, we’ve used our 
doubles play to win matches. Starting 
off the tie so well in doubles really 
gave us confidence that we could pull 
through and advance.” 

But things didn’t go according to 
plan. The Panthers displayed their elite 
form in winning four of the six singles 
matches to come back and secure the 
win. The other two matches were sus-
pended because they had no bearing 
on the outcome. At the No. 1 singles 
spot, Borg beat Moallemi 6-1, 6-2. 
Borg had a score to settle after a disap-
pointing start in doubles, and came 
out firing on all cylinders. Drury’s 
three other singles victories weren’t 
nearly as one-sided, but each of them 
came in straight sets. At the second 
spot, Levi got by Rubens in a tough 
two-setter, 6-4, 6-4. In the fourth sin-
gles spot, Khadasevich nailed down 
the Panthers’ third singles win with 6-
3, 6-4 over sophomore Brandon Low. 
Antonio Garcia Santos registered the 

team’s fourth and final win by getting 
past Placek, 6-2, 6-4. 

In the other two singles matches, 
Drury secured the first set in both 
and was in good position to win. At 
the third spot, Negishi was trailing 
Nahom Serekeberhan by a set at 7-6, 
but the match was on serve in the 
second set, with Negishi up 2-1. At 
the sixth and final singles spot, sopho-
more Vince Nguyen lost the first set 6-
3 to Prpic. The two were engaged in a 
tough battle in the second set, with the 
match all squared at five apiece.

For the year, Moallemi, Nguyen 
and senior Blake Meister were the 

team’s standout players in singles. 
Playing a majority of his matches as 
the team’s No. 1 player, Moallemi put 
together a 9-7 record at the top spot, 
finishing the season 12-8. Meister had 
the team’s best overall record in sin-
gles, going 12-4, while spending time 
at the second, third and fourth spots. 
He holds an undefeated streak of 10 
matches when playing in the fourth 
spot. Nguyen compiled a solid 11-8 
record this season and will be one of 
the team’s key returnees. 

UCSD’s top doubles team for the 
year was Elliot and Moallemi, who 
teamed to go 10-2, playing all their 

matches at the second doubles spot. 
Placek and Rubens were also one of 
the Tritons’ best doubles pairs, win-
ning six of the nine matches they 
played at the top doubles spot. 

Seniors Rubens, Ramesh 
Thonadapu and Whitmore will be 
graduating and played their final 
matches as Tritons. But with a group of 
freshmen and sophomores returning, 
most of whom got to see major action 
in key matches for UCSD, the Tritons 
have high hopes for the future.

Tritons Send Record Number to National Finals
By Jake Blanc
Associate Sports Editor

TRACK & FIELD — With the NCAA 
Division-II National Championship 
a week away, the Tritons can feel 
confident knowing that they will 
head to Walnut, Calif., with their 
largest contingent in school history. 
Fifteen Tritons from the women’s 
side and one from the men’s team 
will participate at the national meet 
from May 22 to May 24 on the 
Mount San Antonio College campus. 
Beside the large number of represen-
tatives at the final competition of the 
2008 season, UCSD will further be 
helped by the location of the meet. 
Lying just north of Los Angeles, the 
Mount San Antonio campus’ prox-
imity to San Diego will allow many 
Tritons to drive just a few hours to 
cheer on their teammates.

Even though the Tritons have 
not competed as a team since the 
California Collegiate Athletics 
Association Championships over two 
weeks ago, a select group of UCSD 
athletes had the chance to partici-
pate in the Occidental Invitational 
on May 10. The meet provided an 
opportunity for a few athletes to 
work out some kinks before heading 
to nationals, and also gave seniors 
one last chance to qualify for the 
national finals. This year, UCSD’s 
performance at the Occidental 
Invitational showed that the Tritons 
are relentless in their competitive 
drive and do not let up even if just 
for a second-thought meet. 

“Usually [the Occidental meet] is 
just a tune-up for the people who are 
already going to nationals and a last 
chance to possibly sneak somebody 
in, but this year we had some out-
standing marks,” men’s head coach 
Tony Salerno said. “[Sophomore 

hurdler] Christine Merill’s time in 
the open 400-meters placed her in 
the top 10 in all of Division II, and 
it was the first time that she had ever 
ran an open 400 — she normally just 
runs the hurdles. We thought she’d 
run fast, but we didn’t expect any-
thing close to what she did.”

Sending such a high number of 
athletes to nationals instills a greater 
sense of confidence in the team, one 
that was already feeding off the self-
assurance of being nationally ranked 
all season.

“[The team is] pretty excited, 
especially the women’s team, which 
is so empowered to show the rest 
of Division II what we got,” Salerno 
said. “There’s definitely a real team 
focus on this one. It’s unusual to 
have that at nationals where you 
normally only have a few people 
going; but we have a good part of the 
team going this year.”

The lone male Triton compet-
ing at nationals will be sophomore 
jumper Casey Ryan, who will enter 
next weekend seeded eighth with his 
season and personal record leap of 
6’10.75” in the high jump. Ryan has 
the opportunity to make a name for 
himself at his first national champi-
onship and gain the men’s program 
some momentum heading into next 
season.

The women are led by senior 
jumper Whitney Johnson, the CCAA 
female athlete of the year, who will 
take part in both the long and triple 
jumps. Merrill will participate in a 
team-high four events at nationals 
by competing in the 100- and 400-
meter hurdles and both the 4x100- 
and 4x400-meter relays. Sophomore 
distance runner Linda Rainwater is 
the top-seeded athlete in the hep-
tathlon and will also participate in 
the high-jump competition after 

her season-best mark of 1.71 meters 
earned her a twelfth seed. 

Although UCSD was one of the 
highest-ranked programs in Division 
II, it still benefits from being under-
rated on the national level, giving it 
the ability to take its competition by 
surprise.

“I don’t think we’re the team to 
shoot for, we’re kind of still the up-
and-comers,” Salerno said. “A few 
outstanding athletes can make all 
the difference at nationals and that’s 
what we’re looking toward. Our 
women’s team, if they put it together, 

could have a top-five finish; a lot of 
things have to happen right for us. 
Rather than just having a few people
