UCI Medial c.t. 
Sued for $2.1 Mil 
IRVINE - Radiosurgical 
Centers Corp. CRCC), designers 
of a proposed gamma-knife 
center, has filed suit against the 
UCI Medical Center. RCC 
claims UCI contracted it in July 
1994 to develop and operate a 
gamma-knife surgery center, 
and that the university subse-
quently canceled the contract 
and decided to bui Id and operate 
the center on its own. The 
company is seeking $1.5 million 
in actual damages and $1 
million in punitive damages. 
RCC's attorney claims the 
company provided UCI with 
blueprints and instructions on 
the operation of the center 
before the university withdrew.

Stanford Police Officer James 
Fitzhenry has filed suit against 
the university for wrongful 
termination and violation of his 
civil rights after being dis-
charged from the Department of 
Public Safety more than a year 
ago. Fitzhenry claims he was 
fired after testifying on behalf of 
another former officer, David 
Hensel, after Hensel was 
accused of stealing a television 
set during a 1992 police search. 
A year before his termination, 
Fitzhenry filed a complaint 
alleging that he was unfairly 
demoted, harassed and treated 
when he requested sick leave.

UNC Rejects $11.8 
Million Settlement 
CHAPEL HllL, NC -
University of North Carolina 
Chancellor Michael Hooker 
announced last week that the 
university would reject a $15.8 
million settlement proposed by 
attorneys representing the UNC 
Housekeepers' Association. The 
five-year-old suit seeks to 
redress historical grievances 
against the university . The 
settlement, which Hooker 
rejected as "excessive in the 
extreme," would require the 
university to make one-time 
payments of $1 ,000 to desig-
nated heirs of all black employ-
ees at UNC between 1793 and 
1960. Current housekeepers and 
grounds keepers would also 
receive $4,OOO-per-year raises.

New North Campus Entrance Construction Forces Detour 
TRAFFIC: Campus-
loop users di veTted to 
N. Torrey Pines Rd. 
8y M8ry HI"lns 
Staff Writer 

Construction of a new campus 
entrance began Wednesday on 
North Torrey Pines Rd. and is ex-
pected to affect UCSD traffic for 
at least three months. 

The c.urrent entrance on 
Northview Drive will be closed 
when the new access route is com-
pleted at the end of March 1996. 

The construction the initial 
phase of a City of San Diego-spon-
sored ~.:configuration of the North 
Torrey Pines Rd. and Genesee Ave. 
intersection. The work will take. 
up to 90 days and requires the 
clesure of Scholars Dr. between 
the information booth and the 
southern entrance of Lot 356. 

Drivers must detour around the 
fenced-off construction area by us-
ing Salk Institute Rd., North Torrey 
Pines Rd. and Northview Dr. 

Individual drivers are not the 
only ones who will feel the impact 
of the construction. The campus 

loop shuttle was also rerouted to 
follow the detour. 

The shuttle schedule has not 
been altered, although UCSD Park-
ing and Transportation Services 
predicts delays because of the new 
route. 

Lots 356 and 357 will remain 
open, although some spaces at the 
north end of the lots will be un-
available during construction. The 
lots will gain between six spaces 
and 12 spaces once the first phase 
of construction is completed. 

Completion of the new entrance 
will mark the end of construction 

on campus, but only the beginning 
of problems for commuters who 
use bordering streets. 

The second phase of the con-
struction involves revamping the 
North Torrey Pines-Genesee in-
tersection, which is already con-
gested. Construction on the inter-
section is expected to take between 
three months and five months, not 
including the time needed to land-
scape the new inters~tion . The 
entire project is expected to take 
up to one year to complete.

Shuttl •• Make Debut 
FUEL: Compressed, natural gas is more cost-
efficient and poHutes less than regular gasoline 

Gunlan Reporter 
The roar of gasoline-powered 

shuttle buses cruising around cam-
pus is a sound as familiar to UCSD 
Sludents IS alternative music blast-
ing from the hump. 

But with the pur-
chase of four new, 
compressed, natu-
ral-gas-powered 
(CNG) shuttle buses 
last November, 
UCSD transporta-
tion officials arc 
seeking to change 
thil noisy trend. 

buses will be added to the UCSD 
shuttle system. Aside from the four 
to be used for the campus loop, two 
buses will run from Sorrento Valley 
- the nearest Coaster stop from 
campus - to the Northview en-
trance. 

The Coaster is a 
commuter rail line 
linking North 
County to down-
town San Diego. 

Following the 
lead of an environ-
mentally conscious 
city, transportation 
officials purchased 
the CNG buses to 
replace the shuttle 
buses presently used 
in the campus-loop 
service.

The second shuttle

Last year, 
UCSD's transpor-

inquired into the 
possibility of buy-

buses - which is 
made up of both unleaded- and die-
sel-fueled buses - the new CNG 
buses will reportedly offer 9O-per-
cent cleaner emissions. 

"'The buses provide for cleaner-
burning fuel. [CNG] is cheaper thin . 
gasoline; and in the Jong term, it's 
less expensive and better for the 
environment," UCSD Shuttle Su-
pervisor Frank Buono Slid. 

The CNG buses were purchased 
for $137,000 each, while their gaso-
line-powered counterparts cost 
$112,000 per unit. The new buses 
were funded by the department's 
vehicle-replacement fund and were 
subsillized, in part, by San DielO 
Gu and Electric. 

Each time the transportation de-
partment collects money, a percent-
IJC of it is lUcked away in the ve-
hicle-replacement fund. This money, 
in tum, is used to purchase new 
vehicles when old ones wear out. 

Transportation offICials said the 
CNO buses 'will be quieter and will 
offer a smoother ride because of an 
air-ride suspension. In addition, the 
new shuttles will be wheelchair ac-
cessible. 

"Evcrythin,1ooks good from the 
standpoint of comfort, " Buono said. 

Eventually, a total of six new 

transportation of-
ficials decided to 

spend the money. 
"From the standpoint of the en-

vironment, it's good. It will offer 
long-term maintenance and add 
newer vehicles to the fleet," said 
Buono. 

According to UCSD Fleet Op-
erations Coordinator Jim 
Bonnardel, CNG shuttles offer 
several advantages, including 
lower maintenance costs, lower 
cost of fuel and cleaner air. The 
currentguoline- and diesel-pow-
ered buses have a life expectancy 
of fi ve years; while theCNG buses 
are upected to lut for JO years to 
IS years. 

'1'bis will secure ourservic:es for 
many years to come. The [CNG] 
shuttles will improve the quality of 
life, there will be no smolte and the 
pollutants will be reduced. The 
shuttles will be much more user-
ti'iQldly," Bonnardel said. 

UC Santa Cruz is the only other 
- UC campus presently using altern.-

tive-fuel vehiclcs,althouJh UCSC' 5 
buses run on propane, a much more 
expensive fuel. 

While there is currently no natu-
raI-lu fuelin, station on campus, 
Bonnardel said plans are in the works 
to build one in the near future.

A.S. Will Vote on Constitution; Middleton Resigns 
FUNDING: February 
special election could 
cost $3,000 
By Esther Yoon 
Staff Writer 

A.S. councilmembers will con-
sider funding an open election for 
a new A.S. constitution at its next 
council meeting. 

The new legi s lation was 
authored by A.S. Vice-President 
Administrative Jennifer Nicoll, 
who requested the spec ial elec-
tion to pass the constitution . The 
special election would be held 
Feb. 6 and will not affect Spring-
Quarter elections. 

If approved,the elec tion would 
require $3 ,000 in funding from 
the A.S. Council budget, accord-
ing to Nicoli. 

"The figure, $3,000, was put 
down arbitrarily - J'm hoping it 
will cost less than that," Nicoll 

said. "To me, it seems the most 
expensive part is duplicating and 
advertising the revised constitu-
tion." 

Nicoll planned for the special 
election to be held during Winter 
Quarter, prior to spring elections . 

"If we elect a new constitution 
during spring, it will just sit 
around for a year," Nicoll said. 

"Another proposal in the consti-
tution requires that the officers run 
as a ticket," she added. "What it 
does is it places three A.S. vice-
presidents - internal, external and 
finance - in committees and clas-
sifies commissioner positions." 

Revisions in the constitution in-
clude adjustments to the makeup of 
the A.S. Council structure and a 
proposal to elect five senators from 
each of UCSD's five college. 

The new legislation also pro-
poses the elimination of open elec-
tions for commissioner positions 
- including commissioner of stu-

dent advocacy, commissioner of 
communications, academic-af-
fairs commissioner, programmer

- Naomi Falk 
A.S. President 

and commissioner of operations-
services and enterprises . 

A.S. President Naomi Falk 
queslioned the propriety of hold-
ing a special election and allocat-
ing $3,000 of A.S. funds. 

"The voter turnout in past spe-
cial elections has been e)ltremely 
low," Falk said. "Whatever the 
content of the proposed constitu-
tion may be, the A.S. cannot af-
ford to hold a special election 
which does not require a set voter 
turnout to pass." 

Within council, Warren Senior 
Senator Ian Middleton 's resigna-
tion was announced. According 
to Middleton, a written request 
from A.S. Administrative Repre-
sentative Paul DeWine enforced 
the resignation - due to a failure 
to maintain "good standing" aca-
demically . 

Middleton's removal from the 
A.S. Council raised discussion at 
last night 's senate meeting over 

determining the means of cancel-
ling a term. 

"In sending this notice, sev-
eral steps to the removal process 
were sidestepped," said Greg 
Hearn, a former A.S. 
councilmember who spoke on 
behalf of Middleton at the senate 
meeting. 

"The judicial board was nol 
consulted, the individual involved 
was not consulted, records were 
not consulted properly and the 
Warren dean was not appealed to 
for any form of a waiver," Hearn 
said. 

In other counci l news, a UC 
facuity proposal to postpone the 
UC Board of Regents ' vOle 
against affirmative action to the 
1997 -98 academic year, as well 
as anotherpropo al from UC Stu-
dent Regent Ed Gomez to rescind 
the entire decision , will be dis-
cussed at the upcoming Jan. 18 
UC regents' meeting.

Mer. Luck Accounts for 
Wilson'. Generosity 

For the first time in his tenure, Gov. Pete Wilson look an 
active role in relieving students of their financial burdens, 
announcing last week that his 1996-97 budget would cover 
the $57 million it woul<;f take to prevent fee increases in the 
UC, CSU and community college systems. 

While this announcement has given students hope that 
Wilson will mitigate future fee increases, we must keep in 
mind that the governor's announcement came after analysts 
discovered a state revenue surplus of $300 million. There-
fore, Wilson's announcement amounts to extra credit on his 
part -:- he put forth no concerted effort to slablize the 
volatile student fees. Wilson can offer this money not 
because he was working hard on the students' behalf, but 
because of a lucky surplus of revenue. 

If Wilson wants to endear the voting student body to him, 
he cannot simply rely on another financial luck of the draw. 
He must take active steps to not only cap fee hikes perma-
nently, but make efforts to decrease student fees. The UC 
Master Plan promised affordable education for all qualified 
students, a promise which has clearly been broken fpr 
nearly a decade. It's time to realize the promise once again. 

As students, we ought to appreciate Wilson's gift - after 
all, he could have given even more money to the penal 
system. But while we owe him gratitude, we ought not lose 
our perspective: Next year, the state may not have a surplus, 
and history has shown that Wilson is far more willing to 
build a new prison than allocate more money to education. 

UnIversity Must Allow More 
&Kilts for Double Majors 

This summer the UCSD Academic Senate announced that 
it had never officially passed a 1991 proposal to raise the 
maximum number of units for students with double majors. 
Until Fall Quarter 1995, academic advisors allowed students 
with ~ouble majors to take up to 230 units instead of the 
single.-major maximum of 200 units. 

Though students who already have the 230 units ap-
proved will be able to continue, those who have not already 
declared double majors could be affected if the proposal is 
not approved. In fact, if the proposal is rejected, the double-
major option could be axed entirely. 

Though the administration may fear that double majors 
will still be hanging around in 10 or 15 years, the way to 
prevent this is not by eliminating the double major. Rather, 
the proposal should mandate that double majors must 
graduate in a certain number of years. Therefore, those who 
want to broaden their studies will be allowed to undertake 
this challenge, without preventing new students from 
entering the university. 

Once a university no longer encourages - and goes so far 
as to dcny- its students the chance to further their education, it 
fails in the very endeavors it claims to promote. If the whole 
basis of a college education is to continually challenge oneself 
with new ideas, then the university officials must not legitimize 
limiting this quest for knowledge to only one major.

HO~ 
The Voice of 

Rea.son 

As 1995 fades from 
memory, we tend to recall 
only those issues that the me-
dia and general public dis-
cussed mosl. frequently. On 
this campus, the most popu-
lar theme seemed to be criti -
cizing ucsb and listing ils 
endless faults. Fees were too 
high, the quarter system was 
inefficient, the regents were 
corrupt, the administration 
was uncar-
ing, the stu-
dents were 
apathetic, 
the social 

life was non-existent and the Library 
Walk was unnecessary. It was cenainly 
a rough year for UCSD. 

But UCSD is not simply a third-rate university in a 
nice environment; it is generally considered to be one of 
the beuer schools in the United Statcs. While most of last 
year's negativity focused on the realities ofUCSD's poor 
quality of education, we mustn' t let that detract from our 
present pursuit, which is a discussion of UCSD's admi-
rable traits. The bottom line is that, despite what actually 
lies within the classrooms and books, outsiders think 
UCSD offers a high-quality education. 

And more importantly, outsiders - including poten-
tial employers and visiting friends - do not witness the 
left-wing political bias afflicting UCSD. Although we 

have to suffer through the personal agen-
das of communist professors and listen 
to propaganda about the coming "social-
ist revolution," the companies interview-
ing and hiring us don't know whal actu-
ally goes on inside UCSD's walls. In 
other words, UCSD has an excellent aca-
demic reputation - yet another justifi-
cation for coming here, and one more 
impressive attribute worth appreciating. 

Thus, as 1996 begins, we should 
make up for last year's shottcomings by 
striving to defend our fine institution and 
to protect its name and rcpullllion. There-
fore, I submit a detailed discussion of 
UCSD's finer attributes, which collec-
tively define one the best universities in 
the world. 

So not only 
can RlMAC 
provide • 

Along the same lines, perhaps 
UCSD's best characteristic is that it s not 
8erU/ey. We don 't have a collection of 
bums loitering around campus or block-
ing important entrances. (While some of 
the people hanging out at the Hump may 
appear to be bums, they're really jllSl 
donning the proper hacley-sack, drum-
beating attire.) We don't need a massive 
police ~nce just to walk to or around 
campus. We don 't live adjacent to a 
crime-ridden neighborhood which sends 
its leftovers to our campus. 

First of all, let's remember the main 
reason most students choose UCSD: It's 
in San Diego, "America's Ii nest city." If 
a student at UCSD didn't come here for 
lhe first-rate science programs, chances 
are he came for the weather. While all 
his buddies are buried under two feet of 
snow back east, he can go for a late-af-
ternoon jog on the beach. And when his 
friends are braving »mph Arctic winds 
just to get to class, he is leisurely stroll-
ing through campus in shorts and a T-

Thursday, January) I, 1996 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

COM_NJARY: As Bill Gates makes more and more money, the American and international public continues to 
. fall victim to Microsoft's suspicious and questionable business practices 

Contributi", Opinion Writer 
The Microsoft Corporation and 

its co-founder, Bill Gates, are often 
spoken of as being synonymous 
with the best software in the com-
puting world. However, Microsoft's 
latest operating system (OS), as well 
as its cutthroat business practices, 
have exposed a side of the company 
which is decidedly less than user-
friendly. 

Windows 95 is supposedly an 
easy-to-use OS designed to protect 
you, the user, from the daunting 
complexities of Ihe archaic Disk 
Operating System and other more 
intricate and confusing operating 
systems. Windows is based on the 
concept of a graphical user interface 
(GUI) developed by Apple, Xerox 
and others - a concept which 
Microsoft had little hand in devel-
oping. It is promoted as efficient and 
simple, but it seems 10 be 
o\lersimplistic in some ways, pre-
venting you from uti lizing the 
muscle your computer was designed 
to nex. If the original purpose of 
computers was to se rve you, it looks 
as though the tabl es have been 
turned. 

The central feature of Windows 
is the GUI, the widespread system 
of using icons in an attempt to pro-
vide a user-friendly gateway be-
tween Ihe computer and ils user; a 
way of giving any simpleton a 
chance to enter the realm of home 
computing. But the end result is a 

bloated mess thai piggy-backs on 
DOS, removes user control, takes 
away virtually all flexibility and re-
duces application and computing 
speed to a crawl - all while pro-
viding near-zero stability. Thus, 
Windows complicates matters, 
rather than simplifies them, because 
it forces your computer 10 go 
through countless extra and unnec-
essary indirecl steps. 

There is no problem with a sys-
tem which lends a helping hand to 
the new user. Anyone should be able 
to jump right into the computer 
world. But he should also be able 
to find out whal he is doing. Other-
wise, only those who write software 
will be able 10 determine what the 
average person needs and what 
should be included in a software 
package, as opposed to enabling the 
layperson to operale a computer 
based on his own individual needs. 
If everyone had the ability to cus-
10m-tailor his computer, Ihe PC 
world would be a much better place, 
especially with the distribution ca-
pabilities and potential of the 
Internet. Windows 95 does not al-
low the user to do this. 

The situation with Windows 95 
can be likened to what is encoun-
tered in trying to repair an automo-
bile. If you don ' t know the first 
thing about Ihe-inner workings of a 
car, you put yourself at the mercy 
of every mechanic who services it. 
Although nobody expects you to 
know everything about your ve-

Microsoft 
becauayou

available: Shop 
.000nd. 
hicle, it would be highly beneficial 
to learn at least a thing or two -
just enough to keep you from being 
totally powerless before a self-serv-
ing auto shop. With something like 
Windows 95 , the program renders 
the user completely powerless. 

Much like the limitalions 
Microsoft ha~ incorporated into Win-
dows 95, the company itself appears 
to be lIying to limit the choices of the 
consumer. Microsoft's near-mo-
nopoly on OS is a very acute case of 
manipulation, primarily because its 

immense markel share is due moslly 
10 fooling people into thinking one of 
IWO things: either they are making a 
free choice for the best product avail-
able, or they are getting a great deal 
with pre-installed software and that 
there is no need to buy anything else. 

To those of you who chose 
Microsoft because you thought it was 
Ihe best product available: Shop 
around. As for those of you who were 
pleased to end up with Windows on 
your computer bec,ause it came that 
way, the following information about 
how Microsoft conducts its business 
may be of some interest. 

Microsoft has two prices for its OS 
software as sold to personal-computer 
vendors. One price is per-copy, and it 
is about 15 percent less than the retai I 
price. The other price is "volume dis-
COIInt," and it is substantially less. The 
calch for the vendor is that they can 
only get the "volume discounl" price 
if they buy one copy for every central 
processing unit they ship out the door. 
Thus, any high-volume PC seller 
would spend close to 5O-percentless 
by going with the per-machine instead 
of the per-copy price. With an incen-
tive like that, almost all PC retailers 
have opted for the volume discount. 

However, this means that the cus-
tomer ha<; to pay for Windows even if 
he wants the system delivered with a 
different OS. Most people are either 
glad that they don't have to make an 
effort purchasing and installing an OS, 
or they realize they've already paid 
for one (without any chOice) and 

won 'I pay for another one - even if 
it's better than Windows. This is how 
Microsoft has prevented smaller com-
panies with better products from get-
ting a share of the market. There is 
just too great an investment risk and 
too greal of an expenllC for a PC ven-
dor 10 include a competing OS. 

Before this tactic was put into play, 
Microsoft drove an even harder bar-
gain. There was a long-standing con-
tractual agreement requiring that a 
royalty had to be paid to Microsoft 
Corporation on any machine sold with 
an Intel microprocessor, the "brains'! 
on which almosl alllBM-wmpatibie 
computers are based. ffiM, Toshiba 
and others won a lawsuit against 
Microsoft last fall which allowed 
hardware vendors 10 provide other 
operating systems on Intel'powered 
machines. Hardware vendors are now 
looking for ways to provide osn, 
Solaris or other operating syslems on 
an Intel compatible chip set - all 
without paying the extra dollars to 
Microsoft for an OS they aren't go-
ing to usc. The lawsuit was sparked 
when IBM tried everYlhing in its 
power to not put Microsoft's'software 
in its machines, but il was md with 
InteVMicrosoft legal challenges at ev-
ery comer. 

Even more examples exist of 
Microsoft's attempts to dupe and ex-
ploit the very public they claim to 
serve. On May 22, InjornllJlion Week 
reported that, "Microsoft officials 
continn that beta versions of Win-

We also have RIMAC, a question-

most students now seem to appre-

to the same bureaucracy that afflicts 
most other parts of campus, and it 
probably shouldn't have cost as 
much as it did; but, in the end, we

can RlMAC complement the sty-

It is one thing for a company to 
lake an inventory of its network of

that just happens to be extremely 

construction. Still, what's done is 
done, and it would be fruitless to 
change it back to its original state. 
Thus, the most productive ap-

about UCSD, just tell them: ''The

they've already heard about it. 

Still, aside from the minor

UCOP Searches for New Offices 
PROPOSALI: 
University officials 
are considering sites 
By Mn DeIventh8I 
Associate News Editor 

Six Bay Area developers and build-
ing owners submittetl proposals to the 
University of Cali fomi a Office of the 
President (UCOP) last week regard-
ing potential locations for the UC's 
principal administrative offices. 

UCOP will selcct its new head-
quarters when the lease on its current 
office space expires in April, 1998. 

The proposed sites, which include 
UCOP' s current location on Lakeside 
Dr. in Oakland, were compiled from a 
list of 21 proposals which the UC 
received from local developers and 
building OWl)Crs in response to the 
university 'S Request for Proposals 
(RFP) for office space last August. 

The sites range in size from 
I 13,000 square feet 10 353,000 square 
feet and include options for the uni-
versity to lease or buy the property. 
Depending on the size of the selected 
site, UCOP would either continue to 
operate under one roof or would split 
its offices between two separate sites. 

The six sites from which UCOP 
will choose are: 

• 300 Lakeside Drive, Oakland; 
353,000 square feet in a 28-story build-
ing. This is UCOP' s current location. 

·2201 Broadway, Oakland; 
178,000 square feet in an eight-story 
building. 

• 1333 Broadway, Oakland; 
194,5 I 2 square feet ina IO-story build-
ing. 

• 12th and Broadway, Oakland;

ley; 118, 100 square feet in a six -story

university and the property owners 
have enough time to prepare the sites

on a variety offactors including: low, 
long-term costs; location within the 
central Bay Area; location appropri-

second phaseto determine thosewhich 
best meet our criteria." 

If none of the locations is found to 
be suitable, Dolgonas said that the UC 
has the option of rejecting all of the 
proposals and launching anew search. 

"At this point, 1 think that's really 
unlikely; but until we get to the last 
site or two, it's hard to tell," he said.

UCOP cur-

moved to its present location in 1988 
in an effort to consolidate its offices, 
which were then scattered over eight 
locations on the Berkeley campus and 
in the surrounding city. 

At its current site, UCOP employs 
1,189 employees in systemwide ad-
ministrative departments and in the 
health and retirement benefits office 
for the entire university, as well as 
staff for the regents, the UC General 
Council's Office, the Office ofTech-

for programs such as AIDS, tobacco 
and breast-cancer research.

Beach in Marin County, Califor-

source to receiver. Because sound nia." 

The UCSD Guardian 

The NMFS did no( conduct an 
necropsy on the whale because "the 
carcass ... was in a state of moderate 
decomposition." Instead, NMFS 
buried the whale in the sand. 

Mary Frampton, executive di -
rector of Save Our Coast, believes 
the necropsy would have turned up 
some unpleasant results for SID, 
forcing the costly ATOC project to 
cease operating. 

"Scripps has not been candid about 
the project from the beginning," 
Frampton said. "A TOe was clearly 
responsible for [the whale's) death. 
We haven 't been tokl the truth." 

"Whales use theirhearing tonavi -
gate and find food ," she added. "Hu-
mans mainly use their sight.... I 
mean,just imagine if you went blind 
for 20 minutes, every four hours." 

Munk maintains that "an autopsy 
was not performed on the dead whale 
because it was not an acoustic kill-
ing." 

"To marine animals, the sound 
from ATOC's speakers is similar to 
a large ship going over ihe surface 
of the water," he said. "And we're 
doing tests at 1,000 meters deep .... 
At that depth, it's a million times 
less likely to affect marine life." 

According to the final NMFS 
report, five days after the dead whale 
was found on Stinson Beach, the 
NMFS was notified that there was 
another dead whale, "noating ap-
proximately eight miles to 10 miles 
offshore the Farallon Islands."Then, 
on that same day, a second dead 
whale was reported to the NMFS at 
approximately "five miles north of 
Southeast Farallon Island."

According to the NMFS report, at 7 
p.m. the "towing bridle broke free 
of the vessel." The retrieval effort 
was finally "terminated due to dark-
ness and heavy seas." 

On Nov. 10 at noon, the Coast 
duard continued its search but could 
not find either whale. At 6 p.m. on 
Nov. 10, the search was called off. 
The NMFS report states that "the 
last sighting of a dead noating whale 
was made at 1:15 p.m. on Nov. 17 
by a commercial fishing vessel,"

After weighing possible causes 
of disease, biotoxin poisoning, com-
mercia I-fishing entanglements, ves-
sel collisions and underwater aquatic 
noise, the NMFS was still "unable 
to determine the cause or causes of 
the recent humpback-whale deaths." 

Jim Lecky, Chief of the Protected 
Species Division of the NMFS, said 
the whale deaths "were purely coin-
cidental" in conjunction with the 
A TOC project. 

"Whalesdie,just as humans die," 
Lecky added. "Whales wash ashore

The NMFS report concluded that 
ATOC probably had nothing to do 
with the deaths because "the two dead 
humpback whales most likely died 
north" of the range of sound and floated 
southward. Moreover, "the state of 
decomposition of the two whales in-
dicates that they died four days to 
seven days prior to their sighting." 

Environmentalists like Frampton 
aren' t buying the explanation. 

"ATOC has been a potential di-

10 OPINION The UCSD Guardian ··Thursday, January II, 1996 

COMMENTARY: With so few students showing up for various protest gatherings, the A.S. should recognize that 
its money would be better spent on issues supported by more people 

A.S. WAS'I'ES ITS TIME WI'IH RALLIES 
By Scott P ...... 
Senior Staff Writer 

As 1996 gets underway, the 
ASUCSD Council needs to make 
a New Year's resolution to aban-
don the pointless protest rillies 
which plagued last quarter. The 
A.S. should resolve to replace 
them with events which might ac-
tually help its constituents, the stu-
dent population. 

Whether it is trying to gain sup-
port for some great cause, show 
the UC regent s the infallible 
strength of the students ' voice or 
improve student involvement and 
school spiri t, the council places far 
too much faith in the effectiveness 
of its rallies . If the A.S. continues 
to sponsor such poignant displays 
of ineptitude, it will only further 
prove that it has no clue how to 
serve the needs of students. 

Our noble council seems to be-
lieve that it can gather together a 
few boisterous individuals, place 
them in a highly visible part of 
campus and expect that they will 
be able to convince the multitude 
of passersby that support is needed 
for some "new" cause. 

The inherent problem with this 
approach is that it is almost im-

• Oliver Peoples 
• Gualtier 
• Matsuda 
• Fred 
• Cartier 
• Armani 

possible to convince anyone of 
anything. Take smoking, for ex-
ample. Millions of Americans still 
aren't convinced that smoking is 
all that bad. If the billions of dol-
lars spent annually on anti-smok-
ing campaigns can't persuade 
smokers to break a habit which 
could easily kill them, why does 
the A.S. think that the relatively 
small amount of money it spends 
on these rallies will do anything 
more than create a mockery of lhe 
cause it 's trying to peddle? 

In a sense, trying to convince 
someone of a particular viewpoint 
is like a business trying to sell a 
certain product. It would not make 
sense for any business to continue 
marketing a productlhe public has 
already rejected. 

This commonsense approach 
cannot be found anywhere at an 
A.S.-sponsored rally. Here, the 
council often tries to sell ideas that 
it, rather than the majority of stu-
dents, deems important. Just like 
the business which can't sell a 
product that nobody wants, rallies 
supporting the pet issues of the 
A.S. eJltemal office will almost 
certainly rail upon deaf cars. The 
A.S. needs to find out what the

majority of students really needs 
from its representative govern-
ment. Too often, it sponsors ral-

lies which do little more than add 
air to the already over-inflated 
egos of its councilmembers. 

In defense of our council, not 
all of its rallies were staged to con-
vince the audience of some 
greater, A.S.-sponsered truth or 
wisdom. Some were held to make 
a statement, a statement which 
draws its impetus from the vast 
numbers of students lhat a cause 
can unite in one place. 

Take, for instance, the 13,000 
students who assembled in front 
of Regent John Davies ' office ... 
oh, I'm sorry, that 's 13 students 
who voiced their opinions about 
the regents ' decision to overturn 
affirmative action. A handful of 
students vehemently demanding 
that this decision be retracted is 
wonderful, but 13 angry protest-
ers cannot accomplish anything 
unless the UC system was com-
prised of, say, 25 students. The 
A.S. does not realize that it is deal-
ing with a board of regents which 
makes policy decisions that it be-
lieves are in the best interest of the 
majority of students, not 13 out of 
the hundreds of thousands who 
comprise the UC system. 

The A.S. loves to point to its 

tour de force, "Freedom City," and 
say: "Ha, this tremendously suc-
cessful rally proves that almost 
everyone at UCSD supports affir-
mative action." This may be true 
in the minds of our council mem-
bers, but an examination of some 
numbers might indicate otherwise. 

While the Guardian listed the 
attendance of the noontime rally 
to be a lofty 500 supporters 
(roughly 3% of the student popu-
lation), I strongly disagree with 
this estimate. As a Price Center 
employee working at the event, I 
can say that the crowd at Freedom 
City was nothing eJltraordinary. 
The vast majority of onlookers 
were simply part of the normal 
lunchtime crowd. In reality, the 
rally only attracted about 100 or 
so true supporters_ This not only 
sounds like a failure in terms of 
attendance, but it also indicates 
that the campus is far less unified 
in support of the issue than the 
A.S. realizes. 

How can the A.S. mak c a 
strong statement about an issue 
when the two biggest rallics of the 
last quarter, the protest at Regent 
Davies' office and Freedom City,

Sean Penn's Acting Drives 
Dead Man Walking 

Tim Robbins' film provides a tough 
look at the death penalty 

By Jeff Hies .. 
Hiatus Editor 

Tim Robbins' new film, DeadMan 
Walking, makes a preUy 
convincing argument 
against the death penalty. 
The problem with Robbins' 
film, however, is not its 
politics, which he delivers 
with more subtlety than his 
debut, BobRobens. Rather, 
because Dead Man Walk· 
ing plays with emotions so 
explicitly, it often comes across as 
manipulative, even as it presents a 
balanced view of a sensitive issue. 

Actress Susan Sarandon met Walk· 

BRANAGH: 
'Shakespeare's plays are 
never just one thing' 
Continued from pace H11 
almost as if lago has given up his 
humanity. He's withoutemotion, with-
out remorse, without regret. It re- . 
minded me of seeing documentaries 
about serial killers who killed to see 
what it was like. 
And whld'i ~ about 
this Y8I'IIan of 0theI0 Is that 
the ... lIlY Is, tID .. extent, 
the ........ l. 

Y cah, it's an interesting device. [ 
suppose Richard m is another ex· 
ample of someone whom the audi-
ence is forced to go along with. I think 
it puts the audience in an interesting 
emotional dilemma. I think that does 
create discomfort. I think Shakespeare 
enjoys having a cold, detached ob-
server like lago, who points out, 'This 
could be you. Do you see how stupid 
people are?" 
How modem are the race is-
lues? 

I think Jago has a measure of rac-
ism, but his contempt for people goes 
across the board. I think.Iago suffers 
from class oppression. He isn't the 
young Florentine darling that Cassio 
is. I don't think his conlempt for 
Othello is purely race-based, although 
it has that element. I didn ' llind it a 
driving force. I know there's a kind of 
obvious comparison 10 the 0 .1. 
Simpson case; but the play is more 
universal in the way it addresses hu-
man emotions, rather than any spe-
cific issue of domestic violence. 
What keeps you coming back 
toShak...,....? 

They're great parts and very rich 
roles. In a play like this, tragic though 
it is, there's a good deal of humor. It's 
the same with the comedies, like 
"Much Ado About Nothing." The 
wedding scene in that play is very 
ugly. SoShakespearc' splays arc never 
just one thing, and that makes therr. 
interesting. ·He also seems to have a. 
view on every human situation: rage, 
betrayal, greed and treachery. And 
yet, he is so elusive himself; you can 
never wort out what Shakespeare's 
politics are or what his religion is. I 
love the fact that he was a shareholder 
in his own theater. He was writing for 
a popular audience, and that makes 
his plays feel like they belong in the 
cinema.

Buck-O-Nine's Not Scared of Success 
Ska-punk band will play at Belly Up Tavern tonight 

IIy Jeff N ..... 
Histus Editor 

To some puriSls.lhe mainSll'ealll success of 
punk bands like Rancid and Green 
Day has signaled the end of the mu-
sicaJ genre's capacity to exist on the 
cuuingedge. ButBuck-()..Ninesinger 
John Pebsworth has a different view. 

"1 love both Green Day and Ran-
cid, both before they were popular 
and after. 'think their newest records 
lie their best yet," Pebsworth said, 
OIIarecenaaftemoon while he worbd 
his "day job" at Taang! Records in Pacific 
Beach. "I'm kind of on the fence because I'm 
one ofthoseold school JUYL TrIditionaIpunken 

are all pissed off about their popularity. I don't 
see anything wrong with it. It's the kind of 
music I've liked for a long time." 

First formed in 1992 through a 
seriesof ads run in the Reade,. Buck-
()"Nine has released three albums. 
Its latest release, a five-song EPtitled 
Waler in My HeotJ. came out just a 
month Il10. A local band which has 
opened for punk bands like Face to 
Face and Agent Orange. Buck-O-
Nine performs tonight at the Belly 
Up Tavern in Solana Beach. 

Pebsworth. 24. said he first became inter-
ested in .. when he was a teenager living in 
Los Anaeles. 

"When I was in sixth grade. I had two older 
friends who liked bands like Madness and the 
Specials. That was the first type of music I ever 
associated myself with. That whole thing died 
and then I got into punk rock." he said. "Sb 
started resurging a few years ago and then when 
bands like the Bosstones took the original for-
mula of ska and mixed it with punk or some-
thing different, I SIarted getting back into it." 

Pebsworth said major labels aren't exactly 
fighting over the band but that·s just fine with 
him. He said that the group is thinking of Iong-
term success. 

Buck-O-Nine will perform with the 
Skeletones tonight at the Belly Up Tavern. For

Goodness 
Goodness 

While Alanis Morissette, Natalie Mer-
chant and PJ Harvey have been getting the 
lion' s share of critical acclaim among female 
vocalists, Goodness singer Carrie Abe might 
be the best of them all. despite the fact that 
she is not supported by a major label and has 
not been on the cover of Rolling Stone maga-
zine. 

Abe, formerly of the Seattle rock-band 
Hammerbox . can sing like Barry Sanders can 
run. Her vocal skills include a powerful range. 
which allows her to stop on a dime. shake-
and-bake and then accelerate back to full 
speed in an instant. 

Akre's voice ranges fmma seducti ve whis-
per to a hurricane force in songs such as 
"Wicked Eye" and "Smoking." 

She is also able to croon with understated 
beauty on tracks such as the Suprernes-inHu-
enced "Labor Day" and the sparse and haunt-
ing "Between You and I." 

Goodness has other bright spots besides 
Akre. The band members are all skilled. but 
more importantly. they play tightly enough 
to keep up with Abe's vocal abilities. 

Garth Reeves and Danny Newcomb com-
bine country-western· twang with rapid-fire 
rock riffs. while the rhythm section is an-
chored solidly by drummer Chris Friel and 
bassist Fiia McGann. 

McGann also sings back-up vocals. ac-
centuating Abe's show-stealing voice -
which the band justly places front and center.

cided to pursue other interests (he 
now fronts the Letdowns). 

Although it might be hard to imag-
ine a band going on without a singer 
whose theatrical displays were such 
an integral part of its live perfor-
mances. Fishwife's three remaining 
members (guitarist Gar Wood, bassist 
Matt Ohl in and drummer Chris

slightly ambiguous phrasing and 
unique metaphors to depict his emo-

banle with diabetes. 

"About four years ago, I wasdiag-
nosed with diabetes. The song was 
about the weird feelings I had before 
I knew I had diabetes." Wood said. "I 
thought of motivational tapes and 
therapy because I was so down. I just 
kept getting worse and worse. until it 
was a big problem."

received its share of hype.

18 OPINION 

MISGUIDED: 
Students' needs not being 
met by A.S. 
ContInued from..... 10 
attracted only 0.08% and 0.6% of the UCSD 
student population, respectively? Regent 
Davies probably has bigger turnouts at his 
birthday parties - a statement which is as 
much a joke as the A.S. 's pitfall rallies. 

When Louis Farrakhan assembled one 
million men in Washington, D.C., people look 
notice of his cause. Whether observers agreed 
with Farralthan or not, the sheer size of lhe 
crowd forced the public to at least acknowl-

The UCSD Guardian 

edge his message. When the A.S. assembles 
a dozen people in front of some 30-story of-
fice building, no one cares. This turnout 
should show the A.S. that rallies will have no 
impact at UCSD if they can't draw a signifi-
cant aRM)URt of support. 

Because the A.S. 's pint-sized rallies are 
truly ineffective at reaching the ends the 
council seeks, maybe it is time to shift gears 
and put a greater emphasis on - oh, I don't 
know - serving UCSD students, rather 
than pandering to the members' personal 
agendas. The only way 10 truly unite Ihis 
campus and raise school spirit is for the stu-
dent council to organize events that students 
wanlto attend, as opposed to events the A.S. 

t/tinJu students should attend. 
I wonder if our beloved council ever asked 

itself, "Now, just how many sIudenls actually 
w .. us to go off and waste their money on an· 
other poorly attended rally in suppon of affir-
mative action." Because the overwhelming ma-
jority of studenIs fail 10 aacnd any AS.-spon-
sored raUies, it is safe 10 say that the answer 10 
this question is an emphatic "No." 

Rather than sit high above its consCituents 
on the third floor of the Price Center and bicker 
with one another, the council should carefully 
examine the attendance lIXaIs for a1IAS.-spon-
sored events. Most likely, they will find that 
leading the list of the most well-attended events 
would be council-supponed movies and con-

..

certs, with raUies at the boaom. This is not to 
say that the A.S. shoujd pump all of its money 
into the programming budget; it simply iIIus-
II'lIICS that rallies do not wort. 

I cIon't want 10 suggest to the council what 
new jdeas it should consider; listening to the 
opinions and ideas of one or two people is some-
thing the council has aIn:ady mastered. I sim-
ply want to encourage the AS. to change its 
direction a little - yes, my beloved council, 
you will actually have to do some thinking to 
tackle this one. It has always been ironic that 
our student government would squander what 
little power and influence it had on events which 
accomplish nothing. Let's try to change this 
course of events during the next year. 

POLICE CREATE CLIMATE OF FEAR FOR CYCLISTS 
Editor: 

The behavior and actions of many 
members of the UCSD Police Depart-
ment seem intended to create an atmo-
sphere of intimidation and harassment 
for cyclists . 

My concern is that the overly legalis-
tic interpretation and application of traf-
fic laws by members of the police depart-
ment is stifling the desire to use bicycles 
as a means of commuting. Although 
UCSD participates once yearly in the 
"Ride 10 Work Day," bicyclists mostly 
undertake their commute with the fear 
that they will be pulled over by a police 
car that was hidden away in order spe-
cifically to entrap cyclists. Instead of 
punishing cyclists, the police should fo-
cus on enforcing laws to protect them. 

As a member of the cycling commu-
nity, I have two central issues to address: 
. First, the community, the police, the

BLOWOUT: 
UCSD dominates 
Continued from ..... 20 
to play a long time, get the ner-
vousness out and get in a rhythm," 
Malone said. "It also gave us a 
chance to see what th.ings they 
need to work on, what things we 
need to emphasize with [the team] 
in the next couple of days." 

With illness and injury plagu-
ing UCSD starters, impressive per-
formances from the less experi-
enced players will be necessary in 
this week's conlests against Divi-
sion III contenders Chapman Uni-
versity and Whittier College. 

Veteran guards Marcia Jeffries 
and Amy Franzen are still slowed 
by the flu, and starting forward 
Karli Jungwirth is out with a.knee 
injury. 

"[Jungwirth's injury] really 
hurts," Malone said. "She's been 
our leading rebounder and second-
leading scorer." 

Yamasaki, however, stayed 
healthy enough (0 provide leader-

FRAUD: NFL is 
actually run by FBI 
ContInued from PIC. 20 
"second season" has become inex-
plicable: Great teams are folding 
while mediocre squads are soaring. 
Storied franchises at the height of 
their powers, like the Kansas City 
Chiefs and the San Francisco Fony-
niners, have been stomped by lesser 
adversaries. Teams with no busi-
I16seven being in the playoffs (read: 
Indianapolis Colts) are vying for 
conference titles. 

There is only one answer - one 
feasible scenario - which ad-
equately accounts for the travesty 
which has befallen this most sacred 
of institutions, the NFL playoffs. 
Natnely, that the entire thing is a 
sham - a conspiracy of epic pro-
portions - staged by the FBI in 
cahoots with countless other ultra-
secret coven government organiza-
tions, overseen and masterminded 
by NFL Commisioner Paul 
TagJiabue to plunge American soci-
ety into a stale of chaos. 

How else can ooc' explain the 
downfall of the 4gers, last year's 
Super Bowl champs, who were con-
quered at home by a Green Bay 
team that, though led by a proficient 
quartefback, was clearly inferior? 

It appeared on Saturday that the 
Packen' owned a personal copy of 
San Francisco's game plan. In fact. 
they probably did, thanks to the su-
per high-tech eavesdropping equip-
ment lent to them by the FBI. Green 
Bay knew each play before the 
Nincn did. 

How else might one account for 
Sunday's miserable Chiefs debacle 
qainst the woeful Colts, a contest 
Sieve Bono threw - literally -
alona with his three interceptions? 

Just as detriniental in the garne 
were Lin Elliot's three missed field 
goals, all of which were well within 
his normal range. While some be-
lieve he just shanked the kicks, it 
seem. much more plausible that 
blackmail was involved. Undoubt-
edly, the ,overnment possessed 
some photopaphs which Bono and 
Blliot preferred to keep tucked away 
in some closet, and the only way to 
ensure their -=rec:y was to hand the 
win over to the Colli. 

hard for the 
squad to main-
tain intensity and 
play tough 
against what 
little competi-
tion the Cy-
clones had to of-
fer. 

Chapman and 
Whittier later 
this week pose a 
much bigger 
threat to the Tri-
tons. 

"They're the 
kind of games 
you have to 
win," Malone 
said. "But yet 
they're scary be-
cause there is a 
potential to lose 
them too." 

Malone

ContInued from INC. 20 
Fortunately for UCSD and Boyd, 
theTritons' times against UCDwere 
an improvement on those recorded a 
week earlier in a disappointing meet 
versus Air Force. 

On the women's side, the Tri-
IOns took the wood to their Divi-
sion U opponents, winning by a 
final tally of 112-62. Freshman 
standout Kelly Byrne and senior 
co-captain Carrie Parker per-
formed well in the freestyleevents, 
with Parker winning the 200-yard 
free (I :59.35) just ahead of Byrne 
(1:59.62). Parker also swam to a 
first-place mariting of 5.24.31 in a 
new event for her, the 500 free, 
while Bymetook first place-and 
the nine points that come with it-
in the 100 free. 

Freshman Linda Monroe did 
her share to secure a victory for 
UCSD by slicing through the wa-
ter in the 200 1M (2: 19.63), the 200 
butterfly (2:20.72) and the 200 
breaststroke (2:31.12).

afternoon, as she reeled in a first-

The UCSD diving squad did its 
share tocontinue the team's domi-
nance of the Aggies by sweeping 
the top three places in both the 
one- and three-meter boards. 

The men were less fortunate in 
the final tally (falling 148·89), 
though they too made solid strides 
toward meeting coach Boyd's ex-
pectations . Sophomore Tim 
McAteer and senior Mike 
Jefferson both turned in quick 
swims in the 200 freestyle. 
McAteer topped off this perfor-
mance with the swim of the day, 
capturing first place in the 500 
free with a time of 4:53.52, more 
than seven seconds ahead of the 
nearest Davis swimmer. 

Other good swims for the Tri-
tons were Kaley Parkinson's first 
place, 49.54, dash through the 
water in the 100 free and Dave 
Tudury's 4.22.97 in the 400 indi-
vidual medley. 

As UCSD diving fans have 
become accustomed to seeing, se-
nior diver Adam Burgasscr held 
the diving banner high by taking 
first place in both the one- and 
three-meter springboard events.

Playoffs or 
Payoffs 

Gradually, the image of 
professional sports is becoming 
soiled by various conspiracies, 
plots seemingly masterminded 
by thieves who are unafraid to 
taint this country 's great, 
athletic institutions for 
personal gain. Ice skating had 
the Tonya Harding-Nancy 
Kerrigan saga; boxing was 
victimized by the Tyson-
McNeeley bout; baseball fell 
victim to the eight-men-out 
scandal. Indeed, the integrity 
of these sacred sports has been 
stolen by the underhanded 
dealings of crooks and good-
for-nOthings. But, of course, 
there is professional football , 
the great American game 
which has remained pure 
through the decades, reminding 
L1S that there are still establish-
ments which transcend human 
greed - until now. 

For the die-hard football 
fan, there is nothing more 
important than the NFL 
playoffs. It is a time for the 
great players to separate 
themselws from those who are 
merely good, a forum in which 
the elite teams rise from the 
ashes in spectacular fashion, 
while the vanquished must 
slink home in defeat. It is a 
time for bone-crunching hits, 
resoundina thuds, tattered 
jerseys, throaty grunts, icy 
fields and pummelled, grass-
stained quarterbacks. 

It's no wonder that, come 
championship time, the 
collective testosterone levels of 
the throngs of crazed, body 
painted, beer-bearing male 
football fans run off the charts. 
At thislpoint, everything is 
magnified that much more. 
The action on the gridiron is 
more intense than it has been 
all seaSon. Teams are playing 
for all the marbles - win a 
game and they move on to the 
next level; lose, and the reward 
is a couch-side seat next to the 
kids for the remainder of the 
playoffs. 

Occassionally, the unex-
pected happens and an upset 
transpires. Most of the time, 
though, one can pretty well 
guess how things will shape 
up. The Niners and Cowboys 
always face off in the NFC title 
game, the Bills inevitably 
collapse in the Super Bowl and 
the Steelers are somewhere in 
the mix. Yes, a lesser team 
occassionally pulls a first-
round upset, but rarely. 

So what's going on this 
year? Suddenly, the NFL's

SUU8III'ER: UCSD's youngsters gain 
experience, as Tritons smash lowly Mills College 
By Robin Kezlrlan 
Staff Writer 

The Mills College Cyclones 
brought little intensity to RIMAC 
arena last night in their match-up 
against the UCSO women' s bas-
ketball team. The Tritons stormed 
past the slower, less-experienced 
squad from Mills for the 
11th-straight year, earning 
their seventh victory of the 
season, 88-31. 

From the first jump ball 
to the final buzzer, the Tri-
tons dominated both sides 
of the ball, the entire paint 
and every other aspect of 
the contesl. Thanks to a three-
pointer and steal by junior guard 
Cindy Yamasaki, UCSO took a 5-
o lead in the first two minutes of 
play. 

The Tritons capitalized on the 
Cy.c1ones' numerous turnovers, 
caused by UCSO's overpowering 
defense, quickness and size ad-
vantage. Junior forward Sarah 
Schneider controlled the inside, 
finishing with five offensive re-
bounds and JO points. 

The fast-breaking play of 
guards Marcia Jeffries and 
Yamasaki pushed the Tritons 
ahead of the Cyclones, 33-12, with 
8:07 left in the first half. 

to the younger Tritons on the 
bench. Freshmen guards Tristen 
Teasdale and Amy McClure con-
tinued the UCSD scoring momen-
tum, sending her team to the locker 
room ahead, 49-22. 

The Tritons' full-timers , led by 
junior forward Anne 

Westmoreland, boosted the 
their intensity at the begin-
ning of the second half. 
Westmoreland, on fire for 
the last five games, posted 
an impressive 17 points in 
only 15 minutes on the 
court. 

Seven minutes into the 
second period, UCSD had a 40-
point advantage (65-25) over the 
tiring, eight-member Cyclone 
squad. Sophomore guard Krista 
Poehler, McClure, Teasdale and 
the remainder of UCSD's bench 
once again took control on the 
court . 

Poehler's ball handling and 
quickness provided 1 I points and 
nine rebounds for the Tritons, 
while Teasdale and McClure 
posted 10 and eight points respec-
tively . 

Due to the Tritons' tough sched-
ule early on, their bench had little 
game experience before last 
night's match-up.

Pays UCSD a Visit 
FUTURE CHAMPS?: Wolverines, favored to win 
NCAA title, will swim against the Tritons on Sunday 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

To say that UCSD doesn't h:&ve the opportunity 
to host a team like Michigan very often is a huge 
understatement. As a Division III school, it is rare 

for the Tritons to even face-off 
against a Division I opponent, let 
alone one favored to take the na-
tional title. But that is exactly who 
will be paying a visit to our very own 
Canyon view pool this Sunday at 
noon: the number-one ranked Michi-
gan Wolverines women's swimming 
team, a squad favored this year to 

program,ofsorts, with UM. 
Boyd traveled to Michigan 
last summer to help train the 
Wolverine sprinters and 
learn how their program is 
run. So, on its way back 
from meets against Hawaii 
and USC, Michigan will be 
paying a visit to Triton-land 
in what promises to be a fun Youth: Freshman such as Kelly Byrne have helped UCSD. 

displace perennial national-champion Stanford Uni-
versity at the top of the NCAA mountain. 

This opportunity came UCSO's way as a result 
of Head Swimming Coach Doug Boyd's exchange 

meet for everyone. 
While UCSD'sswimmers will have a chance 

to hit the water against some of the best in the 
nati9n, including several who have designs on 
the '96 Olympics, the fans in attendance will 
have the privilege of watching these same world-
class athletes from poolside. 

The Tritons prepared for the Wolverines by 

taking on Division n UC Davis on Saturday after-
noon in a "fax" meet. After the Aggies were 
fogged in,the two teams ran the races on their own 
and faxed the times to each other for scoring. 

As is always the case with the Tritons, the only 
important factors in a meet are the times posted 
and what they reveal about the team's progress.
