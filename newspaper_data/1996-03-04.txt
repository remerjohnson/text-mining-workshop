Forum Addresses Student Unionization 
DISCUSSION: 
Unions, faculty and 
administrators attended 
By Mary Higgins 
Staff Writer 

The five-year battle for graduate-
student-employee union recognition 
continued Wednesday night when 
several dozen graduate students as-
sembled in Solfs Hall to participate in 
a forum entitled "Should TAs (Teach-
ing Assistants) and RAs (Research 
Assi tants) UnionizeT 

The forum, which gave students 
and faculty an opportunily 10 discuss 
the potential unionization of gradu-
ale-student employees, was ponsored 
by the UCSD Graduate Student Asso-
ciation (GSA). 

Graduate students Kate Bums and 
Dan Johnston represented the Asso-
ciation of Studenl Employees (AS E), 
an affiliate of the United Auto Work-
ers. Former Office of Graduate Stud-
ies and Research (OGSR) Assistant 
Dean Audrey Lillietieid and current 
OGSR Associate Dean Dave Sworder 
argued against unionization on behalf 

of the UCSD administration. 
Academic Senate Chair John 

Wheeler, who is also a professor of 
chemistry and biochemistry, moder-
ated the forum, which consisted of 
brief opening arguments from both 
parties followed by a two-hour ques-
tion-and-answer session. 

Johnston and Bums argued pas-
sionately in favorof a union, claiming 
it would help guarantee fair treatment 
for the university 's graduate-sludent 
employees, ensure fair wages, trive 
for affordable health care and day 
care, call for comprehensive sexual-

harassment policies and assure smaller 
class sizes by establi hing a col!ective 
bargaining voice. 

Bums, a graduate tudent in the 
department of literature and a former 
Warren WritingTA,assertedthatlhese 
provisions are necessary for all em-
ployees. He also said umon activists 
will not rest until they are granted the 
right to unionize. 

"It's a waste of time and energy to 
fight against us," Bums ·aid. 

However, UCSD administrators 
contended that unionization would be

To some, they are racially diviSIve event!> that 
'egregate the student popa lation. To many, UC 0 ' ~ 
ethnic graduation ceremonies arc a way of ret:og-
nizing minority achievement on a t:ampus which 
can often appear unwelcome to people of color. 

Amid the current conlr~versy surrounding the 
repeal of affirmali ve aClion and an upcoming vote 
on Ihe California Civi l Rights Iniliative, one thing 
is t:ertain: UCSD's oldest alternative graduation 
ceremony, held for African-American student , 
will take place as it has for approximately the last 
15 years. 

On June 15, the UCSD African-American Stu-
dent Union (AASU) - formerly known as the 
Black Student Union - will hold its evenl at the 
New Creation Church in southeast San Diego. 
According to AASU President Sharon Apple, Ihe 
gathering allows "[San Diego's] black community 
to see our graduates." 

"It's our way of recognizing our students," 
Apple said. "I think it's tougher forthem [to go to) 
UCSD and graduate .. .. We want to congratulate 
them."

Library Celebrates Dr. Seuss' Birthday With Cake, Reception 
PARTY: Ted Geisel's 
alter ego would have 
been 92 years old 
By Mae,a Pal 
Staff Writer 

UCSD celebrated the 92nd birth-
day of the late Ted Geisel - the 
well-known children's author and 
illustrator who went by the name 
Dr. Seuss'- in front of the recently 
renamed Geisel Library last Friday. 

The celebration was first orga-
nized by the Mandeville Special 
Collections Library three years ago 

as an inaugural party for UCSD's 
Geisel Collection. After gaini ng the 
approval of Geisel's wife, Audre. , 
the library decided to hold an annual 
birthday celebration in his honor. 

"After we got the collection ... 
we decided it would be a great idea 
to do this every year," Mandeville 
Special Collections Library Direc-
tor Lynda Claassen said. 

In 1993, two years after her 
husband's death , Audrey Geisel 
donated a large part of her husband's 
works to the Mandeville Special 
Collections Library. Two years later, 
the second part of the collection -

then at UCLA - was brought to 
UCSD. 

The Mandevi lie Library now has 
the entire 9,OOO-piece collection, 
consisting of sketches, drawings, 
books and photographs. A portion 
of the collection is currently on dis-
play inside the Geisel Library. 

Friday's party was held the day 
before Geisel's actual 92nd birth-
day because library staff members 
"wanted to celebrate on a day when 
students would be around to enjoy 
it," Deputy University Librarian 
Phyllis Mirsky said. 

Several faculty members wearing 

"Cat in the Hat" hats served cake and 
punch to the more than 60 students 
who gathered for the ceremony. In 
addition, the librarycarillonist played 
songs from Geisel's The Cat in tile 
Hat Song Book. 

Although many tudents admit-
ted they just showed up for the cake, 
everal said a birthday party for Dr. 

Seuss was an excellent idea. 
"He was so interested in our 

school. .. Ithink it 's greatthat we're 
celebrating his birthday even after 
his death," Muir sophomore Megan 
Armor said.

Illegal Student Group 
Feeds Homeless 
CHARITY: Organization distributes leftover food 
to hundreds in Balboa Park every Thursday 
By Kathl .. n Gallagher 
Guardian Reporter 

Several members of the illicit 
UCSD t:harity group, Food For 
Thought, gathertogetherin Balboa 
Park every Thursday to hand out 
donated food to the homeless. 

San Diego law requires that any 
group reeding more than 75 people 
at a time obtain a permil. How-
ever Food For Thought founder Jir~ Stevens said the group's per-

less in San Diego," he said. 
Stevens ' efforts ha ve snowballed 

into the Food For Thought organiza-
tion at UCSD. With nearly 200 regis-
tered members and 20 active mem-
bers, the club feeds hundreds of men, 
women and children every week. 

'" was totally surprised at how 
friendly [the homeless) were," 
Revelle freshman Chad Kretchmann 
said. "They are very cooperative." 

Students volunteer every Thurs-
mit applications 
have repeatedly 
been denied. 

"It is an interest-
ing feeling to know 
that something 
you're doing to help 
the community is at:-
tually against the 
law," Warren fresh-
man Emily Hinton 
said. 

"It Is an

" It was nice to 
go out and help 
people one on 
one," Warren 

l'rought has never 
h4ld any problems 
with police. 

The organization Ii rst began reed-
ing the homeless la~t year. Stevens, 
a lonner New York attorney, was 
himself homeless for several years 
alier giving up all his belongings 
following his 27th birthday and 
moving to Calilomia. 

Stevens lived among the home-
less for several years, claiming to be 
searching lor more meaning in life. 
At one ~int, he lived on the UCSD 
campus and attended classes to learn 
more about the homeless problem in 
America. 

Stevens said that, after experi-
encing the plight ofthe homeless, he 
decided to dedicate his time and 
energy not only in feeding them, but 
also in raising awareness of home-
less issues. 

"It's a chance to let swdents make 
uptheirown minds about [the] home-

- Emily Hinton freshman Mike 
Warren freshman Linscheid said. 

"You look at [thc 
homeless) in it different light once 
you 've interacted with them on a 
personal level." 

Stevens said the organization is 
branching intoareasotherthan imple 
food distribution. He has created a 
team of homeless people which com-
petes in the San Diego Marathon 
each year. 

"Regaining their health is the first 
step to a new life, gelling a job and 
being a productive member of soci-
ety," Stevens said. 

UCSD track team members will 
be joining the homeless team, along 
with several world-class runners, in-
cluding triathlete Scott Tinley and 
fonner mile-world-record holder 
Steve Scott, to show their support for 
the homeless cause. 

The group meets Mondays to 
recruit. new members and to discuss 
different ways to help the homeless.

Capital Punishment

Like the issue of abonion, the ques-
tion of the morality involved in capital 
pUOlshmenttends to provoke very passion-

tal punishment is the only proper response 
10 serious I.:rimes such as murder and rape. 
Opponents denounce it as bloodthirsty and 
brutal, as equally heinous as the crimes

While this moral debate 
has been raging since the 
Supreme Court reinstated 
the death penalty nearly 20 
years ago, we seem to have 
made very little progress on 
the issue. As a result. it is 
now necessary to I.:onsider 
capita l punishment on a 
more practical level. 

One of the arguments 
used by advocates of the 
death penalty involves the de-
terrent effects of capital pun-
ishment. Would-be murderers. 
it is supposed, are less likely 
to I.:ommit their 
crimes if they 
know that Ihere 
IS a good 
chance Ihey 
would be e)( -

is lillie evidence 
that the threat of

execution gives 
pOlential felons any pause whalso-
ever. Inmales on dealh row often indi -

\I cate that they gave little thought to capi-
tal punishment when they committed their 
crimes. More lei hng is that the murder rate~ 
in states which have capital punishment arc 
no lower than those which do nOI execule; 
in facl, Ihey arc often higher. 

A 1991 study published in Ihe journal 
Criminology considered the relationship be-
tween the publicity accorded executions and 
murder rates. The study found no discernible 
relationship betwccn the two. For eumple, a 
Florida corrections onker, intimately aware 
of thcdlcn-pending execution of murderer Ted 
Bundy. ~ommilled a brutal murder 
within a mailer of weeks afler 
Bundy's judicial murder.

the death penalty must pay. Be-

spent nearly $1 billion getting its ex-

only one inmate was executed. Typically. a state 
spends in excess of $2 million on the execution of 
one inmate. It is also estimated thjll keeping an in-
mate incarcerated t'or life is one-tilth to one-third as 
costly as executing a prisoner.

Death Penalty Provides 
Answers for the Country's 

Problems 
Certain people just don't be-
long in a civilized society. 

When people can'l follow 
the laws of the majority. it 
is in society'S best interest 
to separate them from the 

free public. And when the 
worst of such cri minals of-

fer no hope for rehabilila-
tion, supponing them be-
comes an unnecessary 

burden on all law-abiding 
citizens. At that point . it is in 

the best intereSI of society to ex-
ecute these offenders. 

In reality, the debate over the 
death penally is not a debate at 
all. While a debate entails a ra-
tional exchange of ideas with 
refutation and discussion, the is-
sue of Ihe death penalty often 
comes down to a competition 
between professed morals: Op-
ponents claim that murder in the 
form of execution is cruel and 
should be avoided at all costs, 

while supporters claim that the 
death penalty is simply jus-
tified retribution. 

Opponents often cite 
other reasons to avoid the 
death penalty, beyond its 
mere immorality. They 

claim that state-sanctioned murder is 
just the modem form of a primitive 
human emotion - revenge. They also 

• drag out the misunderstood and mis-
leading notion that executions cost 
more than keeping prisoners injail for 
life. Occasionally, they assert their 
"moral" trust in man's ability to be re-
formed. or the belief that one innocenl 
person executed is not wonh the ex-
ecution of 999 who are guilty. But all 
these ideas simply stem from misin-
formation and misguided ideals. 

In the lirsl place. revenge is more 
than a primitive emotion whieh should 
be avoided by " civilized" and 
"evolved" humans. Regardless of how 
developed humans are, they still pos-
sess such instincts. To deny Ihe exist-
ence of innate emotions like revenge 
is silly. Indeed, the mere reality of such 
instincts does not enlirely justify their 
realization in society. After all. a soci-
ety requires the suppression of some 
desires, and it was the criminal's in-
ability to harness his own outlawed 
desires which led him to death row. 
And we can only shudder at what so-
ciety would look like if every man felt 
free to carry out his instinctive sexual 
or violent desires. 

But society also recognizes and jus-

nia Supreme Court. This enormous 
burden precludes the timely resolu-
tion of other legal disputes, such as 
the resolution of important issues in 
state civil law. 

Added to the economic costs as-
SOCiated with the death penally is the 
intense emotional strain put on the 
families of victims by lengthy appeals 
processes. An average of nine years 
passes between the commission of a 
capital crime and the execution of its 
perpetrator. Much of this anguish 
could be avoided if we substituted life 
in prison for the dealh penalty. Fami-
lies of victims would then not need to

tifies some of these instinctive emo-
tions, and revenge is one of them. 
On the most basic level. if one man 
steals from his neighbor. the victim 
will seek revenge or retribution. 
Society 's function, as well as that 
of the justice system. is to resolve 
such conflicts fairly, and to prevent 
rampant vigilantism. While il cer-
tainly includes the notion of preven-
tion through deterrence, justice is 
sl i II just another form of revenge. 
Thus. the death penalty is simply a 
nalural extension of this practice for 
<!xlreme cases. 

This discussion affords us the op-
port unity 10 debunk another of 
sociely" great myths: Two wrongs 
don ' t make a right. Wilness any 
criminal trial : A man stands charged 
wilh assault . Ihe firsl wrong. The 
court then sentences hlln to 6ne year 

worry about criminals getting off on 
some technicality invented by a judi-
ciary opposed to capital punishment. 
Moreover, wouldn't the millions of 
dollars afforded to executions be bel-
ter spent on compensating the fami-
lies of victims? 

Evidence also exists that the death 
penalty has a negative impact on rales 
of conviction. A 1990 study published 
in the JOUI7UJI of Applied Social Psy-
chology found that jurors are less 
likely to convict a defendant if they 
know there is a possibility that the 
death penalty might be imposed. Ju-
rors must be convinced well beyond a 
"reasonable doubt" if they are 10 find 
omeone guilty of a capital crime. 

Eliminating capital punishment might, 

in prison. which can be considered 
a second wrong. While it may ap-
pilar on the surface to be "right" 
because it is a valuable function for 
the betterment of society, it is still 
holding someone captive for an en-
tire year. But because it operates as 
the second wrong. and thus as the 
retribution for the original crime, 
society accepts it. 

The death penalty is no different: 
A citizen committed the firsrwrong, 
and society will exact the second. The 
only di fference lies in the extent of 
the crime and the ultimate need of 
society to punish the criminal. 

Even those who have no moral 
qualms about the death penally still 
express opposition due to the finan-
cial cost. Everyone has heard the 
cliched cries about how it costs 
more to e)(ecute the criminal than 
10 keep him alive for his entire life 
in prison.

gerous criminals behind bars. 

Capital punishment is also im-
posed disproportionately on minori-
ties. Alarmingly, approximately 40 
percent of death-row inmates arc 
black. Even more disturbing statistics 
come from Georgia, where a black 
convicted of killing a white is 24 ti mes 
more likely to be sentenced to death 
than a black who kills another black. 
This racial bias on death row is re-
sponsible for endless numbers of ap-
peals by inmates and costly litigation

Advancement of Colored People). 
These actions contribute even more

cite biased and misleading statistics. 
Tlley take into accounl the entire 
cost of the execution: the original 
court case, the court appeals. the 
requests for pardons. the stays of ex-
ecution. the salaries of those in-
volved in the case, the cost of sup-
poning the criminal while he was 
in jail and the actual cost of the ex-
ecution. But keeping a criminal in 
jail for life has just as much red tape 
and far more amenities . 

Still. such a long list of costs sug-

fectively nullifies any complaints 
about the expense of executions: Fix

If capital punishment accom-
plishes anything, it is the escalation 
o{ !lICial tension in our country. This 
is not to suggest that there should be 
racial quotas in sentencing, for every 
criminal deserves to serve his time. 
regardless of race. But as a practical 
matter, the abolition of the death pen-
alty may actually improve race rela-
tions. 

Tllere is also something to be said 
against the media anenlion given 
death-row inmates. Media coverage 
surrounding executions tends to fo-
cus on the criminal rather than his 
crime. We all will remember the name 
of Robert Akon Harris. but do any of 
us remember the names of his vic-
tims'! Do we really consider his 

of years down the road due to long 
delays. And. if a criminal is sen-
tenced to dealh, kill him. Too often 
we hear stories of people sitting on 
death row for 15 years before being 
executed. 

Consider Mitchell Rupe. a 4()()-
pound murderer who has somehow 
Slaved off execution for years by 
citing his Constitutional right to 
avoid cruel and unusual punish-
ment. He is 100 falto be hanged. and 
the state of Washington has no other 
fonn of execution. This case alone 
calls for serious reform . States 
should be less picky about the form 
of execution, so as to avoid hin-
drances. The righl of the criminal to 
avoid cruel and unusual punishment 
should not supersede those of the 
law-abiding citizens who have to 
plly !O feed and bathe this man. If 
that requires amending the Consti-
tution, so be it. If it is the will of the 
people loday. it should be law. 

OPINION 5 
. I 

cnmcs? II would be far better for us 
to lock up and forget about killers like 
Harris, rather than immortalize them 
and fail to remember their victims. 

Capital punishment is a simplistic 
and ineffective reaction to this 
country's epidemic of v)olent crime. 
At bottom. it isjust am'lher knee-jerk 
response to a difficult problem. It 
would be better to concentrate on the 
prevention of crime than on blind ven-
geance. Prevention takes many forms: 
education. the expansion of economic 
opportunity and the strengthening of 
our families and our faith arc all part 
of the mix. All these will do far more 
to strengthen and ennoble our soci-
ely than Ihe brutality of the death pcn-
alty. 

Some people voice concern that 
hasty court decisions and execu-
tions. along with limited appeals, 
will inevitably lead to the e)(ccution 
of innocent people. But we cannot 
concern ourselves wilh such infre-
quent exceptions. No system is 
without error, and every system may 
unfairly convict one while justly 
convicting 999. It is an unfortunate 
by-product of the system, but one 
which is necessary for -the overall 
maintenance of society. 

The bottom line is that some 
people simply do not belong in so-
ciety, and do not deserve to be sup-
ported and kept alive in prison ei-
ther. Tlley cannot be rehabilitated 
and will never leave jail. At that 
point , especially if judicial reforms 
are initiated. it would be much 
cheaper to dispose of them than to 
pay for Iheir subsislence. By kill-
ing them. we will improve ourcoun-
try both economically and socially.

GSA: UCSD says

Continued from pc. 1 
detrimental to the educational goals 
of the university. 

"After looking at (similar] pro-
posals at Serkeley, we've decided 

said. 'The difference is that right 
now, it 's one-sided. As long as [bu-
reaucracy is] on their side, [the ad-
ministration is] OK with it." 

As an alternative to forming a 
union, Littlefield advocated the ex-
isting policy of airing job-related 
grievances to a superior. 

• [that allowing graduate students to 
unionize] would be counterproduc-
tive," Sworder said. 

'1'here are distinct job descrip-
tions for TAs on campus; if you're 
doing too much, you should repon 
it. (fyou're having problems, talk to 
your advisor," Liulefield said. "If 
that doesn't solve the problem, talk 
to the department head." 

, . 

In addition, Littlefield pointed to 
a potential loss of student jobs as a 
result of unionization. 

"If III had to deal with a union, 
I'd simply hire a staff member [in-
stead of a graduate-student em-
ployee]." Littlefield said. 

While claiming to suppon the 
idea of unionization in general, 
Sworder said he fears acknowledg-
ing a union of graduate students 
would only funherbureaucratizethe 
system - something he "wants to 
avoid." 

Muir Writing Program TA An-
thony Navarrete said he thought the 
administration has a double stan-
dard when talking about "bureau-
cracy." 

"[Students] are the ones who ha ve 
to deal with bureaucracy," Na varretc

GSA President Steve Dubb said 
complaining to a superior often ex-
acerbates problems. 

"If you complain to your depan-
mentchair,you're likely to be passed 
up for employment the next time 
around," Dubb said. "(Littlefield] is 
asking students to take a real leap of 
faith ." 

Several T As present at the forum 
complained of unfair treatment, in-
cluding burgeoning work loads 
which exceeded the 20-hours-per-
week ceiling requirement. 

Sworder acknowledged that "in 
new writing classes ... TAs could not 
get done in 20 hours what needed to 
be done, but we 've adjusted to that."

"I think we all know that (a 20-

"[The administration's] main ar-
gument is that we're not employ-
ees," Navarrete said. "[But] the UC 
is increasingly like a corporation-
bureaucratized. We need something 
that is prepared to keep up." 

Last October, after nearly three 
months of hearings with both San 
Diego ASE and UC administrators, 
the California Public Employment 
Relations Board (PERB) accorded 
UCSD readers, tutors and acting 
instructors the right to bargain col-
lectively. The decision, which does 
not apply to T As and RAs, is now 
being appealed by the university. 

Navarrete said the university is 
pursuing an appeal of PERS 's Oc-
tober decision in hopes that gradu-
ate-student employees would aban-
don their quest for unionization. 

"It seems (administrators] don't 
even care about winning; they want us 
to get tired. graduate, get Ph.D.s and

ing to spend millions and millions of

"I really hate this, right here," said 
'Jane,' a student at UCSD, as she poked 
her stomach. "I cat one lillie thing and it 
just blows up, so I have to get rid of ii, 
and there's on ly one way . [My family and 
friendsjtreal me like I'm crazy, like I'm 
some sort of victim, and I get really pissed 
off because I don't see myself like that. 
This is me; this is how I control my 
body." 

Jane is one of millions of women in 
the United States with an eating disorder. 
After engaging in frequent bouts of binge-
ing, followed by purging, she was finally 
medically diagnosed as bulimic. 

Eating disorders have long been attrib-
uted to psychological factors. But does 
this adequately explain why such disor-
ders have become a national epidemic 
among women'! 

Some experts don'l believe so. instead, 
they point 10 a number of social and cul-
tural reasons as the cause, particu larly lhe 

The UCSD Guardian 

on e wa 
Long condUJered a PdychoLogicaL problem, 
eating duorderd may be a reduLt of cuLture 

media's role in advertising images of the 
ideal woman - the incredibly emaciated, 
fit, Cindy Crawford type. Health ex pens 
believe that abnormal eating behavior can 
also be a rebellion against this ideal and 
the way women are expected to acl. 

"It's problematic to talk about women 
wilh eating disorders as victims because 
then il focuses on the pathology of it, the 
way in which it is individualized, ignoring 
the way the cultural contexl or sociely 
determines femininity," said Sarah Banet-
Weiser, a visiting professor of women's 
studies and communications at UCSD. 

Licensed clinical social worker Susan 
Ward holds workshops which help 

women at risk feel more comfortable with 
their bodies. She emphasizes that the 
image of the ideal female figure is largely 
constructed by the advenising industry. 

"The cu lture in Southcrn California 
says, 10 be happy, you need to be as skin-
ny as possible," Ward said. "We compare 
ourselves to magazine images that have 
been created by a computer plus a lens, 
and the [model] could have starved for the 
ad, so that may not be her natural body. 
So we are comparing ourselves to - and 
striving for - a distoned image." 

On the other hand, others suggest that 
eating disorders could be an attempl by 
women 10 gain some measure of conlrol

over Iheir bodies. Sanel-Weiser said that 
prematurely identifying the problem as 
"psychological" may overlook the disor-
der's true origin. 

Many experts feci the advcrtising 
industry is not solely culpable for the out-
break of cating disorders . The typical 
female co llege student might restrict her 
diet as a way of cOnlrolling one aspect of 
her life, while she watches other things, 
such as grades, failing relationships and 
homesickness, spiral out of control. 

"Sometimes it's difficult being in 
charge or yourself, especially if it's your 
first time being away from home," psy-
chologist Beverly McCreary said. 

Of course, some women feel pressured 
to limit Iheir weight in order to maintain 
social relationships, orten employing dras-
tic measures to reach these ends. Jane.

cause. 

"Sometimes I think that if I 
were thinner or prellier. we might 
~till be together," she said. "I just 
want to make sure that the next 
lime I' m with someone, he'll be 
happy with what I look like." 

Ward describes a woman like 
Jane as the "bulimic who is almost 
like the 1950s woman," rebelling 
against the modem conventions of 
the professional "superwoman." 

Ward believes that , in many 
ways, the idealized woman depict-
ed in the media is not as feminine 
as she was in years past. 

"[Someone like Janel wants to 
be all things to men," Ward said. 
"She wants to be sexy, sweet and 
as soft as possible. She wants to be 
as feminine as possible in a world 
where it 's just not as fashionable 
to be feminine as it used to be . 
They have 10 perform in a male 
world , when the truth of the mailer 
is that they would rather not." 

In Tire Ob.l'e.fJion: Reflection on 
lire Tyranny of Slenderness, author 
Kim Chernin argues that a 
woman's eating disorder may be a 
reflection of the frustrations 
caused by the behavioral restric -
tions placed upon females, in 
which they arc expected to act pas-
sively, "lady-like." 

Chenlin writes that in starving 
herself, the woman is in fact strug-
gling with her femimty - a feel -
Ing which derives itself from her 
body. 

"The body holds meaning," 

Chemin wrote. "Through her con-
cern with her body, she is express-
ing a serious concern about the 
state of her souL" 

In addition, experts have theo-
rized that anorexics adopt the iden-

_ tity of the mind in opposition to 
the body, viewing the two as dis-
tinctly separate entitles. Women 
see the body as demanding, uncon-
trollable and something to be over-
worked. 

It is also through the body that 
the traditional conventions of 
womanhood are openly defied; in 
other words. some women restrict 
their diets to avoid femininity. 

Malnutrition often makes an 
anorexic's menstrual cycle irregu-
lar, and her body loses its natural 
womanly curves. which are often 
viewed by the anorexic as fal. By 
fasting, the anorexic might be act-
ing on her fear of becoming a 
woman. 

"I am suggest i ng that the 
changing awareness among 
women in this society has divided 
itself into two divergent move-
ments , one of which is a move-
ment toward feminine power, the 
other a retreat from it, supported 
by fashion and diet industries 
which share a fear of women 's 
power," Chemin wrote. 

Surprisingly , anorexics were 
looked upon as saints in earlier 
centuries because of their willpow-
er to suppress biological drives . 
Now, starvation has shifted from a 
religious practice to the religion of 
our culture - namely exercise, 
slimness and body image. 

But not all women suffering 
from these problems are necessari-
ly malleable victims of the media.

The UCSD Guardian 

As Hilde Bruch discusses in her 
book. The Golden Cage: The 
Enigma of Anorexia Nervosa. 
some women ignore their exces-
sive thinness because remaining 
slender has become a statement of 
power. 

"It 's true." Lisa. an anorexic. 
said. "When r don 't eat, I feel a 
sense of superiority. I can control 
my own body 's urges. Most people 
can't do that; they just give in to 
whims. and then they don't have 
control." 

At 5'4" and 99 pounds, Lisa is 
"proud" of herself. She used to be 
much thinner. 

"I know I have a problem." she 
said. "And I'm working with (my 
therapist) at fixing it. But right 
now, I'm happy with what I look 
like." 

Aside from the obvious health 
risks of malnutrition. there are 
other harmful and possibly perma-
nent effects which can arise from 
eating disorders, such a.. infertility, 
and even death. 

""'s a condition; it's nor, make-
up, it's not hair, it's nOl a phase or 
condition that 's going to change," 
Ward said. "It's a contrived, con-
trolled body that goes against fem-
ininity. Make-up and hair enhance 
femininity . Eating disorders hurt 
femininity ." 

Susan Bardo. author of 
Unbearable Weiglrt : Feminism, 
Western Culture and the Body, 
argues that an anorexic's body is 
inscribed with everything that is 
wrong with our culture. 

"Far from being the result of a 
superficial fashion phenomenon, 
these disorders reflect and call our 
attention to some of the central ills 

of our culture - from our histori-
cal heritage of disdai n for the 
body, to our modem fear of loss of 
control over our future, to the dis-
quieting meaning of contemporary 
beauty ideals in an era of greater 
female presence and power than 
ever before." Bardo writes. 

Ward noted that anorexia and 
bulimia can stem from an emotion-
al trauma, such as the loss of a 
boyfriend, death of a parent, not 
gelling into a school or not making 
it onto a team. Many of these hard-
ships result in the woman feeling 
some sort of personal pain, a 
though she has failed somehow. 
The eating disorder sets in when 
she tries to regain control of some-
thing in her life. 

In a fast-paced , competitive 
society, those who attempt to 
achieve the ideal are rewarded. 

Live In 

Monday, March 4, 1996 

despite the harmful physical and 
physiological sacrifices made in 
the process. Most experts therefore 
agree that society should recognize 
the undue pressures brought on by 
trying to emulate these images, 
and it should make an effort 10 
eliminate the positive feedback 
from such virtually unattainable 
goals. 

"Culture could assure her that it 
values her precisely for the femi-
ninity emerging now in her body, 
admire the power of the feminine 
and find meaning in its relation-
ship with nature," Chemin said. 

Indeed, if society as a whole 
were to reevaluate the way these 
cultural images are constructed -
and change them - women would 
not feel the pressure of having to 
live up to such an unreachable 
ideal.

CSUDH Bests UCSD 
By Only Two Strokes 
RIVALRY: UCSD and Dominguez continued a 
tradition of tight fmishes, as CSUDH won, 308-310 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

The lasl six times the UCSD 
golf team competed against Cal 
Stale University Dominguez Hills 
(CSUDH) . both team s 
battled right down to the 
wire. A mere six shots or 
less separated Ihe two 
squad s in each of those 
meetings. 

Friday 's trip 10 CSUDH 
was no different , as the Tri -
ton s trav eled to Palos 
Verd es to duke it out with 
Dominguez at the Los Verdes golf 
course. 

Unfortunately for UCSD. th is 
duel went the way of its foes from 
up north , as Domingucz Hill s 
snuck past the Tritons in a typi -
cally tight contest, winning by a 
slim , two-shot margin. 308-3 10 . 

At the top of the ladder. the two 
squad ~ were dead even. The med-
ali st award - gi ven to the pl ayer 
with the bes t score over the cou rse 
- had to be split between UCSD', 
Arni e Campbell and CSU DH' s

Adame both posted rounds of 74 
to lead their respecti ve clubs.

Greg Johnson chipped in

golfer in the mix, finishing 

with a round of 83 . 
"Our matches with Dominguez

"Unfortunately for us. we came

Tritons Split in MuddviUe 
ONE-FOR-TWO: The Tritons chalked up their 
third win of the year in Friday 's split with eMS 
By Mike Stange 
Staff Writer 

If only you cou ld th row out your 
worsl Inning like dropping your low-
eSI test score. The Tritons missed a 

Iwo-game sweep over 
Claremont-Mudd -
Scripps by one frustrat -
ing inning on Friday 
night. UCSD gave up 
seven first-inning runs 
to the Athenas in the 
opener, forcing them-
selves to play catch-up 

through the remainder of the contest. 
'They came out tearing it up," 

freshman pitcher/outfie lder Sarah 
Bumssaid. "Wejust weren ' t on tOpof 
things." 

The Athenas took advantage of 
some early Triton walks and put the 
ball in play to manufacture those seven 
deadly runs. 

UCSD didn't get down, however, 
coming back strong with six runs of 
its own, but its efforts proved too 
liUle, too late, as it was not able to 
overcome the early CMS tallies. 

"Honestly, we dominated them 
after that [first] inning," Bums said. 
" It was really frustrating. We just 
couldn't make it bappen." 

Bums moved in from her day job 
in centerfield to the pitcher'S circle as 

UCSD doubled up CMS, 6-3, in the 
nighlcap. The Athenas, again, scored 
tbe Ii rsl ru n of the second game, bul 
this time the Tritons were able to stop 
theblecding. CMS only managed one 
run in the bollom of the second in-
ning, and UCSD look over in the 
third, scoring three quick runs to take 
command of the game. 

Bums, proving she can do it all for 
the Tritons. doubled in second-
baseman Adrienne Vasquez to take 
the lead for good in the third inning. 

"We had some key hits," Bums 
said. "We were getting on ba e and 
hilling the ball a lot better. We got the 
hits when we needed them." 

The Athenas didn't challenge un-
til late in the fifth inning. By thaI 
poi nt, the Tritons were battl i ng mother 
nature as well as eMS. The rapidly 
selling sun Ihreatened to suspend the 
game unless the necessary five full 
innings had been played. UCSD, lead-
ing 6- 1, played for outs LO speed up 
the game and leI two Athena runners 
to cross the plate in the waning min-
utes of twi light. 

UCSD moved to 3-5 with the split, 
but allowed CMS ( 1-8) to pick up its 
first win of the season. The Tritons 
will play another doubleheader 10-
morrow against cross-Iown rival USD 
at Alcala park. 

UCSD Bombed by BYU 
By Steve Walsh 
Guardian Reporter 

After an all-to-brief slint against 
a fe llow Division III team in its last 
malch, the UCSD men 's volleyball 
team was agai n sacriliced LO 
the Di vision J li ons - make 
thaI the Brigham Young Uni-
versi ty (BYU)Cougars - of 
the Mountai n Pacilic Sports 
Conference. 

The Truons traveled to 
Provo on Friday to take on 
11th-ranked B YU and were' 
not treated kindly by thei r hosts. 
Tbe Cougars made quick work of 
the Tritons, sending them back home 
after a three-game sweep. 

Once again, the Tritons found 
themselves overmatched by their 
Division [ opponents. The Cougars 
dominated the game at the net, stuff-
ing back 15 of the Tritons' kill at-
tempts and racking up a hilling per-
centage even Steve Timmons would 
envy. 

An intimidating crowd of 1,578 
saw the Tritons unable to stop the 
powerful Cougars in game one, as 
BYU put away 26 tills for the 15-9 
win. In the second game, Head 

Coach Doug Dannevik and hi s 
troops were unable to overcome 12 
hilling errors on the way to dereat. 

"We started off slow," UCSD 
middle blocker Devon Jeffcoat said. 

"Bul we showed some hean 
in game three and started 
playing wilh some fire." 

The Tritons got over their 
weak play just in time to give 
the Cougars a battle in the 
fi nal ga me. The Tritons 
played with inspiration, pUI-
ting II points on the 

scoreboard before finally being laid 
LO rest by the Cougars. Senior cap-
tain Tom Black and sophomore Malt 
Riley led the UCSD resurgence by 
recording 15 and 12 kills, respec-
tively. 

"We ' re a young team," said 
Jeffcoal. "We make inexperienced 
mistakes, bUI that is only going to 
make us a stronger team in the fu-
ture." 

The loss dropped UCSD's record 
to 2- 11 on the season. The Tri tons 
geltoshowoffwhallhey've learned, 
as Ihey open a five-game home stand 
against Vassar University on Tues-
day.

llitons Begin Qualifying Season With a Bang at Aztec 
AIM HIGH: UCSD posted a number of NCAA-qualifying marks at the San Diego State Aztec Invitational last weekend 
By Dan KnIft 
Sports Editor 

March I, 1996, was the ,first day 
that NCAA track qualifying marles 
could be recorded. As a result, ath· 

letes across the COlIn· 
try declared open sea-
son on automatic and 
provisional times, as 
well asheightsanddis-
tances, trying toeam a 
spot at the champion-
ships come year's end. 

"';;'..:.:.1_- UCSD's athlete 
were no different, as the Triton con-
tingent made the short trip south to 
panicipate in the Aztec invitational at 
San Diego State University Saturday. 

The Aztec Invite boasted not only 
Division 1 collegiate athletes, but also 
local club runners and national team 
members from other countries. Con· 
sidering the competition, the resul~ 
were panicularly satisfying for UCSD. 

Among the most impressive high·

lights for the Tritons was the perfor-
mance of freshman high jumper 
Heather Winberry , who managed to 
catapult herself over the 5'5" marle. 

Winberry 's leap landed her nOl 
only a personal record but a provi-
sional qualification to the NCAAs as 
well . Winberry will undoubtedly be 
lookmg for an upgrade to an auto· 
matic bid later in the season. 

Lisa Shepard showed the lield of 
triple jumpers what a Division 111 
athlete i capable of accomplishing. 
Shepard bounded to a distance of 
37' I 1.5", taking second place behind 
Amy Conole of SDSU. Shepard 's 
performance earned her an automatil: 
bid to NCAAs. 

On the men 's side, it was a pairof 
distance gallopers and hammer 
throwers who made the biggest im-
pressions. J.J. Castner's 3,OOO·meter 
time of 8:25.07 was a school record, 
while teammate Goss Lindsey placed 
fourth in the 1,500. 

Though tbe majority of the colle-
giate runners ballied it out in the open 
division, Lindsey stepped in with the 
big boys at the invite division and 
finished only behind a pair of national 
tearners and a club runner. His ti me of 
3:53.1 I was good enough for an auto-
matic NCAA bid. 

"I haven ' l seen [Lindsey] run thai 
strong, aggressive and confident in a 
mce of that caliber since he has been 
at UCSD," HeadCoach 

Although this rounded out the 
qualifiers for the Tritons, other ath-
letes took advantage of the stiff com-
petition to show what they (;ould do. 

Sophomore Gavin Klinger, com-
peting in the 5,000 for the first time, 
finished fourth withatimeof 14:56.91 
only two seconds shy of an NCAA-
qualifying time. 

"[Klinger] has been consistent with 
hi s preparation for meet ," Van

toss, I 66' 10". 

Arsdale said, adding that his tremen-
dous improvement has followed his 
strong work ethic. 

Doug Olander's second-place fin-

ish in the triple jump was notable 
because it was a personal record by a 
foot . Meanwhile, Juan Magdaraog 
held the sprint banner high for UCSD, 
finishing the 100 in 11.21 seconds to 
capture the win in the open division. 

"[Magdaraogj gOI a good start and 
jusl ran away from lhe field," Van 
Arsdale said. "He's reaiiy taking over 
the driver's scat of our sprint team." 

TIle women's sprint team also had 
a good day on Ihe track, with both 
Kathy Li and Joyce Lee running well. 
The duo has posted imprOVed times 
under the tutelage of sprint coach Wes 
"Magic"Williams, which could make 
this year a good one for the Tritons. 

Other notable fini shers for UCSD 
were hammer thrower Tara 
Monaghan, who took third in Friday's 
event ; freshmen Jenny Card, who 
reeled in a personal be ·t in the 1,500; 
and Maggic Dwire and Robyn 
Hcrskowirz, who fini shed 2-3 in the 
open 800 meters.

Biola,5-0. 

The Trilon hardballers wenl 10

Virginians. Senior southpaw 
Mike Bryant slaned the con-

throwing eight strong innings 

. and allowing just one run. 
!,refers to the UCSDbase-

ball team ' s losing streak. The 
long list of consecutive fail -
ures ended last Thursday 
when the Tritons defeated

Though things stayed almost 
too close for comfon, Andy

Tony Lin 's sacri ficial squeeze 
brought in the winning run for the 
Tritons. 

"It was a real good ballgame," 
UCSD Head Coach Roben Fletcher 
said. "It was basically a pitcher's 
duel, and [Bryanl] pitched real well 
for us. He's our number-one pi~cher 
right now." 

UCSD finished ils road trip al

test by a score of 4-0. The game was

UCSD Unable

GAME OVER: The Tritons season ended, as no UCSD 
fencer managed to qualify for a trip to the NCAAs 

By 0.. Kr8ft 
Sports Editor 

The "rebuilding season" is a phrase often 
repealed among sporting circles when a coach 
wants Co put a positive spin on a potentially 

Tritons e.gaining an NCAA bid, as 
he was named the second alternate 
for the west. 

Other top finishers for UCSD were 
Matt Soskins and Ted Bertier in sa-

grabbed ninth place in epee.

negative situation. This year's 
UCSD fencing endeavor was 
dubbed just such a year by Head 
Coach Lisa Posthumus. How-
ever, her athletes proved to her 
that rebuilding can hold some 
elements of success. 

On Saturday and Sunday,the 
Tritons hosted the western 

regionals, an un fficlal NCAA event which 
determined what individuab would be scnt to 

repre~nt the "left coast" at the NCAAs. 

The Triton women were expected 
to be more successful, and-accord-
ing to Posthumus - were capable of 
qualifying a few competitors for na-
tionals. And while the foi lers demon-
strated clearly the vast improvements

weekend 's unofficial NCAA regional event held in UCSD's Main Gym, 

The m(m had first crack at qualifying on 
aturday, and SD was forced to settle for 

fourth overall among the top-six teams from the 
Wc!>t Coast which had heen invited to compete. 
The Triton men 's foi I and sahre tcams each took 
fourth place in thcrrrcspecl!vcdisciplines, while 
the cpee squad wa\ forced to settle for fifth . 

Foilist Vikral1l Hatti'was closest among the 

they made this season, the epee team proved to 
be a bit of a disappointment. 

The foil team fini shed fourth overall while 
epee placed third. Individually, the epee squad 
was paced by Jeannie Rockway (7th), Janet 
Wertz (9th) and Suzanne Walters ( 11th). 

Wertz, although she linished second among 
her teammates, was the lone fencer chosen as a 
possible west repre entative in NCAAs, when 
west coast coaches voted her to the third alter-
nate position. Her honor was based on her 

consi tently dominant performances through-
out the season. 

'" expected better re ults [from epee)," 
Posthumus said. ' ''They dominated conference 
this year, butthis was a bad day forthe women's 
epee team. It just fell on the wrong day." 

The foilists offered Posthumus something 
to smile about, as Jeni Terrell, Connie Szeto 
and Hannah Griffith placed ninth, I Dth and 
12th, respectively, while demon~trating the 
large strides they have made. Perhaps the

The Forty-Niners had easily beaten UCSD in 
their fir t meeting of the season, 15-1 . How-
ever, on this day, the battle came down to the 
last match of the contest, whi h Long Beach 
captured to escape with the 9-7 triumph. 

"We started off knowing that this was going 
to be a rebuilding year for us," Posthumus said. 
"And (think that is exactly what we succeeded 
in doing."

According to Tri-

Turner, the sole 
doubles win may not 
have given the Tritons 
their first point, but it 
did raise their hopes.

Dreams Vanish 

the 3..:6 singles seedings 
By Nloole Sunderland 
Guardian Reporter 

The UCSD men's tennis team 
demonstrated its depth at home lasl 
Friday, defeating Cal State Los An-

geles, 4-3, and im-
proving to 3-2 on the 
season. 

After failing to 
pick up a point for 
doubles action, the 
Tritons had to rely on 
strong singles play to 

........... _ ... gain the victory. 
"We had never lost '\ doubles 

point this season," UCSD number-
six singles player Ping Yeh said. 
"But I felt pretty confident that we 
could make up the gap in singles." 

The tandem of Dan Brounstein 
and Anthony Melichavek could not 
fulfill its duties at the number-two 

_ spot. losing 8·3, while Emil Mihet 
and Steve Shabcl were defeated in 
the third seat. 8-2. 

The lone victory for UCSD in 

"The first losses 
put us a little behind, 
but [Wilson and 
Steidlmayer's) win 
gave us some momen-
tum into our singles 
matches," Turner 
said. 

After the botlom-
three singles players 
earned easy victo-
ries, the deciding 
match was played out 
in the third spot. 
Steidl mayer came 
through again , 

Yallov ZoIoIom/GuMfian outlasting his oppo-
nent , 6-4, 7-6. Comeback kid: Eric Steidlmayer came from 

behind to win his doubles match and then 
took his singles contest in straight sets. 

'" wasn't really 
worried about win-
ning or losing the 

match; , just tried to win every 
point," Steidl mayer said. 

doubles came from Eric Steidl mayer 
and Mike Wilson, who won 9-8 in a 
match which switched leads almost 
as often as the players switched sides.

TIME'S UP: UCSD was ousted from the 
Division III playoffs by the Tommies of St. 
Thomas (MN), 66-42, on Saturday afternoon 
By Robin Kezlrlan 
Staff Writer 

Thi s eason has been a dream 
come t rue for the UCSD women's 
basketball team. The Tritons 
claimed 19 wins and suf-
fered only seven losses 
against a schedule of top-
ranked opponents, as they 
made their second-ever 
Division III playoff ap-
pearance. 

They left their mark in 
the UCSD history books, 
defeating Pomona Pitzer Col-
lege, 58-57, in the first round of 
the Division III tournament last 
Wednesday night for their first-
ever tournament win. 

"We improved over last year," 
Triton Head Coach Judy Malone 
said . "We played a tougher 
schedule, had a better record and 

were ranked higher in the re-
gion." 

Like all good things, however, 
the UCSD women's season had 
come to an end. UCSD dug deep 

but could not overcome 
the squad from the Uni-
versity of St. Thomas last 
Saturday, losing 66-42. 

"We never gave up," 
Malone said. "We worked 
hard and didn't quit. We 
just got beat" 

Before they left for 
St. Paul, Minn ., the Tritons 
knew how tough their oppo-
nent would be. SI. Thomas , 
whose 24-2 record included 22 
consecutive, home-court victo-
ries, would provide the Tritons 
with their fiercest competition 
of the season. UCSD fell be-
