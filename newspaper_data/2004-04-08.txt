Stu~5hows 
drop in 

foreign grad 
enrollments 

Math professors call for 
lower textbook prices 

By (HllmNE PAl 
Senior Staff Writer 

Foreign graduate student appli-
cations and enrollment in research 
universities in the United States 
dropped considerably this year due 
to heavier student visa laws enacted 
as anti-terrorism measures, accord-
ing to a survey conducted by the 
National Association of Foreign 
Student Advisers, the Association of 
American Universities, the 
National Association of State 
Universities and Land-Grant 
Colleges, the American Council on 
Education, and the Council of 
Graduate Schools. 

The report stated that such a 
statistic indicates the "stagnation 
and decline" of international edu-
cation exchange programs in the 
United States. 

"The perception appears to be 
that it reflects an unwelcoming cli-
mate in the U.S., and that it's diffi-

CalPIRG, faculty members 
urge publisher to take action 

ByUSAMAK 
Staff Writer 

Over S40 mathematics faculty 
at more than 125 of the nation's 
universities have joined forces 
with the California Student 
Public Interest Research Group 
to urge textbook . publisher 
Thomson Learning to reform its 
production and pricing practices. 
The joint call for action began 
after Thomson Learning, in cor-
respondence with CalPIRG stu-
dent advocates, dismissed con-
cerns and refused to take steps to 
reduce textbook costs, according 
to CaIPIRG. 

CaIPIRG's Jan. 29 report on 
the textbook industry, titled 
"Ripoff 101: How the Current 
Practices of the Publishing 
Industry Drive up the Cost of 
College Textbooks," found that 
students pay an average of $900 
per year for textbooks, an 
increase of 24 percent since 1996. 

The report also found that pub-
lishing companies use various 
methods to inflate the price of 
books. 

Thomson Learning's widely 
used calculus text, "Calculus: 
Early Transcendentals," served as 
an example of how book prices 
are raised. A comparison of the 
founh edition of the text, pub-
lished in 1999, and the 2003 fifth 
edition, reveals minor changes 
that, according to student and 
faculty advocates, do not justify a 
new edition. 

"[Thomson Learning] is basi-
cally an example of what's wrong 
with the whole textbook indus-
try," Derlin Hsu, a CalPIRG text-
book campaign coordinator said. 
"Also, calculus as a subject hasn't 
changed in the last hundred 
years, so it's safe to say that calcu-
lus booles only have a certain jus-
tification for getting new edi-

Only two races proceeded 
into the single runoff process, 
introduced for the first time 
in the 2004 election season, 
after A.S. officials announced 
A.S. general election results 
late on April 7. 

"We expect voter turnout 
to be very low," said A.S. 
Elections Manager Tom 
Chapman. 

In two days of voting, 
April 8 through April 9, inde-
pendent candidate J eon Pae 
will compete against Students 
First! contender Harish 
Nandagopal for the A.S. 
presidency. Jane Bugea and 
Jose Zamora will also face off 
to fin the second at-large 
position at Thurgood 
Marshall Conege. 

Chapman estimates that 
publicity and candidates' 
voter drives will bring out 
slipdy more than nine per-
cent of the eligible voters, or 
balf of the participation in the 

, 

general election. 
Pae had 222 more vote 

than Nandagopal in .the gen-
eral elections. 

"We've just got to get 
people out to vote - that's all 
there is to it," Nandagopal 
said about his campaigning 
plans for the runoff period. 

After Chapman read the 
results of the general election 
at Round Table Pizza, former 
independent presidential can-
didate Steve York announced 
his suppo" for Pae. 

"Jeon Pae is a legitimate 
candidate who is full of 
integrity and honesty," York 
said. "I'm going to throw all 
my support towards her, 
whatever little suppo" that 
is." 

Unity presidential nomi-
nee Jeremy Cogan did not 
back either of his former 
opponents, though he said 
many on his slate would also 
suppo"Pae.

Jane Goodall to receive 
award at Scripps on April 30 

The Scripps Nierenberg Prize for Science in 
the Public Interest will be awarded to prima' 
tologist Jane Goodall in a ceremony in front of 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography on April 
30 at 7:15 p.m. Goodall WIll be awarded 
$25,000 and a medal in recognition of her 
work studying chimpanzees and raising aware-
ness on the relationships between animals 
and humans. The ceremony will be followed 
by a free public presentation called "Reasons 
for Hope" and a book signing with Goodall. 

Goodall's research in East Africa explores the 
evolutionary past of humans. She has worked 
under the mentorship of anthropologist and 
paleontologist Dr. Louis Leaky, and has traveled 
to Tanzania, Africa, to study wild chimpanzees in 
the Gombe Stream Reserve. Goodall found that 
chimps, who were previously thought to be veg-
etarians, were actually meat eaters. She also 
observed the chimpanzees' abilities to make 
tools and documented the social organization of 
the animals in the wild. 

Goodall eamed a doctorate in ethnology 
from Cambridge University. She created the

I A.5. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
Meeting.2S 
April 7, 2004 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
Item A 

The A.S. Council reallocated $8,000 
from the operations and services income 
account to Triton Taxi by a vote of IS-I-I. 
The funds will be used to cover over $9,000 
in outstanding bills &om Qoud 9 Shuttle, 
which provides the Triton Taxi service. 

According to Commissioner of Student 
Services Kelly Vasmt, a dramatic increase in 
the number of students using Triton Taxi 
caused Cloud 9 to increase the number of 
shuttles reserved for the service, therefore 
increasing unexpected costs. 

Thurgood Marshall College Freshman 
Senator Alan Haimowitz objected to the . 
allocation because Cloud 9 did not inform 
the A.S. Council of the increase in shuttles . 

According to Vasant, there is no feasible 
way to estimate how many students will use 
the service. 

ItemC 
The council approved the appointment 

of Anjanette Urdanivia to Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joseph W. Watson's 
Strategic Planning Team by consensus. 

ItemE 
The council approved the appointment 

of Lindsey Stevens as the undergraduate 
representative to the Task Force on 
Underrepresented Faculty through spring 
quarter 2005 by consensus. 

Reports 
ReveOe CoUege Senior Senator Stefani 
Martinez 

Martinez reported that female Revelle 
College students who are graduating in 

spring or summer 2004 are invited to a tra-
ditional afternoon tea at the home of Ellen 
Revelle on April 24 at 3 p.m. The event is 
limited to 40 students. 

John Muir CoOere Sophomore Senator 
Nam Bui 

Bui encouraged councilmembers to 
attend the Muir Musical's production of 
"Company" on April 8 through April 10. 
Students may purchase tickets at the UCSD 
Box Office or Middle of Muir for $6. 

Old Business 
ItemE 

The council approved a $400 allocation 
to the Black Student Union to attend the 
AfricanlBlack Coalition Conference from 
April 30 to May 2. 

ItemF 
The council approved an ad hoc task 

force to compare and evaluate marriage and 
domestic partnership benefits/policies at 
UCSD after a vote to pull the item from 
committee failed. 

The task force is charged to research and 
evaluate marriage policies and benefits and 
evaluate the impact that the removal of 
domestic partnership policies would have. 

ItemG 
The council successfully overturned a 

presidential veto of legislation that requires 
the vice president internal to appoint a 
council parliamentarian by a vote of 14-0-2. 

ItemS 
The council successfully overturned a 

presidential veto of legislation that makes it 
possible to pull an item from committee 
with only a majority vote. The veto was 
overturned with a vote of 14-1-1.

Foreign: Laws blamed for enrollment drop 
continued from pace I 

cult to obtain a visa, II NAFSA 
spokeswoman Ursula Oaks said. 

According to associate director 
of the International Center 
Michael Hindi, however, the influx 
of foreign students, scholars and 
faculty to UCSD has not dropped 
in the past few ~ despite the 
more complicated visa application 
system, but has rather steadily 
increased, especially among for-
eign undergraduate and graduate 
students. 

In the 2000-01 academic ~, 
UCSD received 2,690 interna-
tional scholars, faculty, grad stu-
dents and undergraduate stu-
dents. By the 2002-03 school year, 
the number rose to 3,431. Results 
from the 2003-2004 year are not 
yet available. 

"I think UCSD is a magnet 
school, and students from all over 
the world are interested in com-
ing here," Hindi said. 

Hindi also said that UCSD 
receives international students 
primarily from East Asia, Europe 
and Latin America, and noted that 
institutions who receive many stu-
dents from the Middle East and 
South Asia may have lower num-
bers of enrollment. 

According to the report, of the 
250 universities that participated 
in the survey, about half of the 
prospective international gradu-
ate programs in Fall 2004 report-
ed a decline in student applica-
tion, while 38 percentreponed no. 
change and 14 percent reponed 
an increase. The drop is "particu-
larly acute" among the 25 doctor-
al and research institutions that 
accept the highest number of for-
eign graduate students. 

"We had been hearing signifi-
cant [informal] information about 
students who experienced visa 

delays in the process, II Oaks said. 
"In terms of what the problem is, 
it was more serious in the gradu-
ate area." 

Compared to applications for 
Fall 2003, the survey shows a 60-
percent decline in 130 research 
and doctoral graduate school 
institutions, while 28 percent 
reported no change. 

An investigation by the U.S. 
General Accounting Office 
revealed similar trends. The 
GAO's study specifically investi-
gated science research students 
from China, India and Russia who 
applied for a student or exchange 
visa. 

According to the GAO report, 
obtaining a visa can be delayed up 
to 67 days for foreign science 
research students in China, India 
and Russia. The interview process 
with a visa consulate may take two 
weeks on average in Russia, but 
five to six weeks in China and 12 
weeks for an interview in India, 
the study stated. 

"The key is that when the 
applicant applies for the visa, it 
takes a certain period of time. The 
applicant must understand that 
they need to apply early," GAO 
spokesman Jess Ford said. 

Both reports cite that the pos-
sible reason behind the decline is 
due to increasingly strict visa 
issuances inspired by higher secu-
rity measures implemented by the 
United States to control terror-
ism. 

"There exist conflicts between 
a freer issuance of student visas 
for the United States and main-
taining homeland security, partic-
ularly after the events of 
September 11,2001," Ford said. 

According to Wayne 
Cornelius, director of the UCSD 
Center for Comparative 

Immigration .Studies, the 
reports' results highlight the sit-
uation of foreign graduate stu-
dents rather than undergraduate 
students because graduate stu-
dents "have more options" and 
other countries are less stringent 
in issuing visas. 

"If they're qualified to attend 
graduate school in the United 
States, they're probably just as 
qualified to enter Ph.D. pro-
grams in European countries or 
in Japan," Cornelius said. "They 
probably have more options, and 
franldy, those other potential 
host countries are less problem-
atic in terms of getting student 
visas." 

Cornelius noted that the ter-
rorists of the September 11,2001 
attacks had tourist visas, not stu-
dent visas. He also said the answer 
to controlling terrorism does not 
lie in strict student visa issuances 
but in monitoring issuance of 
tourist and temporary visas. 

"If you wanted to crackdown 
[on potential terrorists!, that 
would be the area," Cornelius 
said. "Student visas are the least 
likely to be abused." 

NAFSA recommends a "bal-
ancinr system" to encourage for-
eign students to study and research 
in the United States ~t acconuno-
date homeland security by request-
ing the Department of State to pre-
sent a more efficient and timely 
visa-issuance system. 

Cornelius expressed concern 
that if the problem is not resolved, 
U.S. research institutions and 
programs may be undermined. 

"We need to maintain competi-
tiveness in certain scientific fields 
and we really cannot hope to do 
that if we don't have access of the 
best brains from abroad," 
Cornelius said.

Books: Math professors at 
UCSD sign CalPIRG letter 

continued from page I 
tions." 

In the repo", CalPIRG stated 
that American students pay signifi-
cantly more for "Calculus: Early 
Transcendentals" than students in 
other countries. According to 
Thomson Learning's Web site, the 
book costs $122 for American stu-
dents, $65 for British students and 
$97 for Canadian students. 

"There's a huge price discrepan-
cy," Hsu said. 

In a Feb. 9 letter to Thomson 
Learning, CaiPIRG requested that 
the company take four steps to 
address the issue of textbook prices. 
These included continuing to pub-
lish the current edition of 
"Calculus: Early Transcendentals" 
until there is a significant need for a 
new edition, establishing a fairer 
pricing system to reduce the price 
discrepancy between costs to 
American and students of other 
countries, ensuring that faculty are 
informed about all textbook 
options, and producing an online 
version of the text to pass cost sav-
ings on to students. 

In a response dated March 15, 
Thomson Learning declined to 
directly address these requests or to 
acknowledge that a problem exist-
ed. 

"We can only assure you that 
we do our best to match our busi-
ness practices with our customers' 
needs - a responsibility we take 
quite seriously," the lener stated. 
"We respect PIRG's right to dis-
agree with those practices, 
although we question efforts to 
single us out, disseminate incorrect 
information about one of our text-
books, or to contact our customers 
directly." 

Student advocates reiterated 

the same requests in an April 6 let-
ter to mathematics faculty mem-
bers at universities across the 
nation urging them to sign the let-
ter. 

"I find it outrageous that 
Thomson Learning has treated stu-
dents with such contempt by break-
ing their promise to reduce the 
prices of textbooks," UCSD visit-
ing mathematics professor Henry 
Tuclcwell said. 

To date, eight UCSD mathe-
matics professors, including half 
the professors teaching calculus 
this quarter, have signed the letter 
to Thomson Learning. 

"Professors are under constant 
pressure from publishers to use the 
latest (edition]," Tuckwell said. "In 
reality, in mathematics in particu -
lar, many of the older texts are as 
good or superior to more modern 
ones, making it clear that the only 
motivation for the string of new 
expensive texts is financial gain for 
publishers. " 

In February, Thomson 
Learning announced a new line of 
reduced-price textbooks, called the 
Advantage Series, available in the 
summer of 2004. 

However, according to 
CalPIRG, the new line covers a 
small number of booles and does 
not address other concerns, such as 
the lack of new content in new edi-
tions and the price difference 
between books for American and 
students of other countries. 

Hsu hopes that the current 
Thomson Learning campaign will 
help to change publishers' pricing 
policies. 

"It's the first step toward the 
change that we want to make in 
the whole textbook industry," Hsu 
said.

Vote Nandagopal in the 
. presidential runoff 

After three days of vot-i~g, .the general elec-
non IS over. 

Time to vote again. 
In the runoff election, our 

first choice for A.S. presi-
dent, Steve York, has been 
eliminated, and the remain-
ing combatants are Students 
First! candidate Harish 
Nandagopal and indepen-
dent candidate Jenn Pae. 
Nandagopal is the most 
effective of the two, and 
deserves the uppo rt of 
UCSD undergraduates in 
the runoff. 

Although Nandasopal 
focuses on off-campus Issues 
more than we would like, he 
has made an attempt to be 
more inclusive this year. His 
efforts to include groups tra-
ditionally ignored by the 
slate show that despite his 
fiery rhetoric, Nanaagopal 
does believe in uniting the 
campus and bringing people 
together. He has expanded 
Students First! to mclude 
the Greeks, and his platfonn 
even calls for reaching out to 
the College Republicans 
during a planned voter regis-
tration drive. While he is an 
outspoken political liberal 
and a progressive activist on 
campus, ne still cares about 
issues facing the average stu-
dent: Triton Taxi, concerts, 
athletics and, above all, 
diversity. 

Next year's A.s. Council 
will face a $175,000 short-
fall, regardless of who 
becomes president. 
Nandagopal has a plan, 
albeit an intimidating one, to 
show students the reality of 
what would happen with 
such cuts. He wants to pass 
two versions of the A.S. bud-
get - one that incorporates 
a proposed fee increase to 
compensate for the cuts, and 
one that does not. Students 
would see their favorite 
clubs and events getting cut, 
and understand tile reafity of 
the situation. No other can-
didate has such a realistic 
plan. Nanda~opal's telling it 
like it is: Things will be cut 
unless fees are raised, 

And that~ one of his most 
attractive qualities - unbri-
dled honesty. Where other 
candidates traipse around an 
issue or seek to avoid con-
troversy, Nandagopal says 

what he believes. In that 
respect, he is very similar to 
York. There is no doubt that 
Nandagopal would be open 
with his constituents. In 
one-on-one encounters, he 
is charismatic - even if his 
public persona is sometimes 
off-putting. Nandagopal has 
the knowledge of the cam-
pus necessary to get things 
done. He knows about every 
nook and cranny of UCSD, 
every backdoor, every 
opportuni ty available for 
students to fight for their 
rights. He mows how to 
negotiate with administra-
tors and work with them, 
but, in his words, he will 
"never workfor them." 

Pae is also an approach-
able personality, and has a 
full resume of leadership 
positions, but lacks the 
foresight and concrete 
plans of Nandagopal. Her 
past experience ranges from 
Vice President Internal to 
student representative of 
the UCSD Chancellor's 
Search Committee, and 
Pae recently captured 
Triton Athletic Council's 
endorsement. She has com-
petently chaired this year's 
A.S. Council meetings, but 
those meetings have not 
yielded much change in the 
campus community. 

Campaigning on a plat-
form of sincerity, integrity 
and ambition, Pae alludes to 
the problems UCSD faces, 
but IS quite vague on what 
the solutions are. Pae does 
not approach the position 
with as much visible excite-
ment, thought and planning 
as Nandagopal. 

Nandagopal was one of 
the few qualified candidates 
on the Students First! slate, 
and he deserves to be elected 
A.S. president. 

The runoff system gave 
students a chance to vote for 
independent candidates like 
York. Next year's implemen-
tation of Instant Runoff 
Voting will be even better 
for UCSD democracy. 
• York must remain 

involved. There is an open 
senior senator position on 
Muir College Council, and 
MCC chair-elect Billy 
Lieberknecht should sen-
ously consider the eloquent 
York to fill the seat. 

We shouldn't need to care 
A.S. candidates roost understand that 

a good student pernment is one 
that we don't feel the need to involve 

ourselves in.

THURSDAY, ArRlL 8, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

How did we survive before the mini-skirt? 
San Diego's youth shed their clothes, don sandals and rub on 
the pumpkin orange "tan ... in ... a ... can" whenever the sun shines 
indecent 
exposure 
Marianne Madden 

I t's spring. Let's all take our clothes off. Such appears to be the 
prevailing sentiment at UCSD 
these days . On the first day of 
spring quarter, newspapers 
reported that "Dozens of high 
temperature records were brollen 
in southern California," and what 
more excuse do UCSD girls need 
to test new and eliciting ways to 
display 99% of their surface area? 

Naturally, no discussion of San 
Diego weather is complete with-
out the comment, "San Diegans 
are incredibly spoiled, because the 
weather is always so beautiful 
here." So here it is : San Diegans 
are incredibly spoiled, because the 
weather is always so beautiful 
here. 

But here's something you may 
not know - I'm actually not even 
sure I know it myself. 

According to reliable, 
unnamed sources, the typical 
southern Californian is comfort-
able in a range of temperatures 
spanning about 4 degrees 
Fahrenheit. I'm guessing this 

range is between, say, 72 and 76 
degrees. Compare this range to 
the average Canadian (comfort-
able within a range of tempera-
tures spanning 20 degrees, the 
lower limit being zero Kelvins, or 
absolute zero), the average north-
ern Californian (comfortable as 
long as their Starbucks latte pro-
vides a nice warming feeling or, if 
they are a college student, as long 
as their fingers are warm enough 
to easily light a joint), and the 
averl-ge Floridian (comfortable as 
long as their pink plastic lawn 
flamingos don't melt). 

Fine, fine. I can accept this. Go 
ahead, make cracks about how 
southern Californians have the 
adaptive ability of a newborn 
sponed owl with jaundice and a 
lazy eye. We don't mind - we're 
too busy testing the bounds of 
indecent exposure laws. (Not to 
brag, but - properly equipped 
with a wooly turtleneck sweater, a 
heavy snowboarding jacket, fleece 
pants, and U boots - I am able to 
comfortably subsist in tempera-
tures dipping down to 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit.) 

Joy be upon us, San Diego is 
enthusiastically bounding toward 
a sweat-beaded summer, and this 
means one thing: skirt season. If 
it's frilly, transparent and descends 
no more than five inches from 
one's crotch, girls are wearing it 
right now. Wide, bright stripes are 
in this season, because apparently

1t Easter Sunday Mass: 

we weren't exposed to enough 
hideous '80s fashion the first time 
around. And it's attractive for 
one's behind to resemble that of a 
zebra. But I digress. 

Like creatures rising up from 
the deep, such skirts appear when-
ever temperatures rise from "sort 
of warm" to "OK, it's definitely 
warm now" - and UCSD girls, if 
we do nothing else with pride, it's 
wearing these skirts. Men are left 
pondering such crucial questions 

" If it's frilly, transparent 
and descends no mare 
than five inches from 
one's crotch, girls are 
wearing it right now, " 

as, "What sort of benevolent 
being invented these garments?" 
"What are these girls wearing 
underneath'" and "Will I pick my 
jaw up off the ground in time to 
make it to my next class?" These 
are good questions, and ones that 
this column won't attempt to 
answer. 

Instead, I'll instead avoid 
answering another pressing ques-
tion: Why do some girls find it 
appealing to dye their skin the 

color of baked ham' Day-Glo 
orange skin, especially when 
paired with bleach-blonde hair, is 
simply not a natural, healthy or 
attractive feature . Maybe these 
girls are able to see inro the 
future, when "Skin Cancer is the 
new Pink!" Or do these girls wish 
to enhance their tan lines, thus 
highlighting their naughty bits so 
their mentally challenged 
boyfriends won't face any sort of 
challenge when displaying their 
extremely large, uh, personalities? 
I can only wonder. 

Between buttoning my skirt 
and slipping on my regulation-
height Reef sandals this morning, 
I wondered how people in the 
1950s survived such heat as we're 
experiencing right now. Surely the 
poor wretches, trapped in pleated 
pants and knee-length skirts, 
sweated to death in southern 
California springs and summers? 
Maybe it was colder in the '50s 
than it is now. Yes, it must 've been 
- being forced to cover any sig-
nificant amount of skin in 75-
degree weather is just inhumane. 
Perhaps the naming of the Cold 
War as such was a manifestation 
of these oppressed peoples' dream 
to be freed from the clutches of 
excess heat! Perhaps nuclear win-
ter seemed lille a welcome respite 
from sweaty feet and tight belts! 
(Perhaps nuclear winter should 
not be milked for its comedic 
value.) 

Certain sc ienti sts talk a lot 
about global warming these days, 
and a certain man who happens to 
be the president of the United 
States systemati cally ignores the 
findings of their research. What 
more evidence of systematically 
rising temperatures do we need 
than an obvious long-term fashion 
trend, that of rising hemlines? 
Demand create supply, people. [ 
think I'm onto something. Or 
perhaps the people of earlier eras, 
living in the terrible dark ages 
before bottled tans came on the 
market, simply couldn't make 
their legs an acceptable shade of 
"sultry bronze" (also known as 

pump~in orange) to wear short 
skim. 

Well, we shouldn't burden our-
selves with such depressing 
thoughts. At the rate hemlines are 
rising, in the year 2030, skins will 
actually ri c six inches above one 's 
waist (leaving approximatel), 20 
percent less to the imagination 
than present miniskirts) . How will 
lawmakers revise decency laws to 
adapt to the evolving fashion, I 
wonder? 

Well , no matter .. It's d ropped 
below 72 degrees, so I must locate 
my parka.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY. APRIL 6. 2004 

Lofty goals and empty promises 
from ASUCSD candidates 

Average students don't care about UCSD 
politics, just want to get on with their lives 

By MARIANNE MADDEN 
Associate Opinion Editor 

In the midst of this year's batch 
of A.S. candidate statements -
among the lofty promises to fight 
for this and advocate that -lurk a 
few strange propositions made by 
otherwise straight-shooting can-
didates. One candidate aims to 
"open A.S. to all students;" anoth-
er words this sentiment a little dif-
ferently by promising to "create 
la] welcoming A.S. environment 
for all." 

And yet it gets worse. During 
April 2's candidate debates, two 
candidates voiced their number 
one goal if elected as increasing 
student involvement in Associated 
Students. Students Rirst! candi-
date Harish Nandagopal is quoted 
as saying, "My number one prior-
ity as A.S. president will be to 
change the A.S . structure so we 
get more students involved." 
Independent presidential candi-
date Steve York voiced this same 
sentiment, lamenting that "A.S. is 
a closed-door club." 

If the A.S. Council is truly a 
closed-door club, this is a problem 
- a government composed of 
only an exclusive group of people 
is a sign of an aristocracy, not a 
democracy. Yet it's odd for many 
candidates to claim to seek 
increased student involvement in 
student government when most 
UCSD students have made it 
abundantly clear that they don't 
want to be involved with the A.S. 
Council in any way, shape or 
form . Furthermore, if student 
government is competent, stu-
dents have even less incentive to 
want to get involved. If govern-
ment works well, the average per-
son barely has to think about it. 

To be fair, the candidates who 
are effectively advocating bigger 
government were perhaps simply 
padding their candidate state-
ments or spouting empty rhetoric 
during the debates. If either of 
these scenarios are the case, then 
candidates should be ashamed for 
degrading the quality of their own 
campaign. Yet the truth is proba-
bly uglier. These candidates aren't 
content to wile away their college 
careers advocating on behalf of 
their constituents - they want to 
drag the constituents themselves 
into the lumbering, bureaucratic 
process of student government. 

But why? If UCSD students 
wanted to get involved with Stu-
dent government, they would run 
for office, attend town hall meet-
ings and vote. But UCSD stu-
dents, as a whole, willingly avoid 
all these tasks. Less than 20 per-

cent of UCSD students voted in 
last year's A.S. elections, as scan-
dal-laden and heavily publicized 
as they were. Furthermore, when 
town hall meetings are held - for 
example, the ones held in regards 
to the University Centers expan-
sion - a negligible number of 
students actually attend. 

Should UCSD students be 
brow-beaten for being apathetic 
toward politics? Who knows -
but in any case, it's unproductive 
to do so. The average person -
the average student, especially -
has immediate interests (like com-
pleting class assignments) that 
supersede the issues that concern 

gover~entrepresentatives. ~ost 
UCSD students don't want to 
worry about fee referenda, the 
best way to improve the parking 
situation, or any of the other mat-
ters that the A.S. Council con-
cerns itself with - they simply 
want problems fixed, enjoyable 
events offered and the like. And 
that is the precise reason why stu-
dent government exists - so a 
small group of dedicated students 
can act in the interests of other 
students. Most of us aren't inter-
ested or qualified to go through 
the bureaucratic red tape that's 

" The new A.S. Council 
would be weU .. seroed to 
get back to basics and 

realize that it serves the 
students, and the average 

student simply doem't 
desire to became 

embroiled in the council's 
weighty but bureaucratic 

affairs. " 
necessary to accomplish anything 
in student government. 

The whole point of electing 
government is to elect a compe-
tent group of representatives that 
are in tune with their constituents 
and act on their behalf. If this 
process occurs, the constituents 
(in this case, UCSD students) 
should not have to worry about 
their government or the issues 
they're working on. So if this 
year's A.S. candidates truly want 
to fight on our behalf, they should 
hardly demand that more students 
become involved with the A.S. 

Council. Government representa-
tives should make politics their 
job so the average person doesn't 
have to. 

Governments, especially stu-
dent governments, face the unen-
viable task of fighting on the 
behalf of an unappreciative con-
stituency. Furthermore, when a 
government works well - when 
it's small, streamlined, effective 
and efficient - the average con-
stituent should barely notice it's 
there. Only when a government 
makes a mistake or fails to serve 
their needs do people notice it 
even exists. 

Regardless of why UCSD stu· 
dents as a whole shy away from 
voting and other forms of civic 
involvement, it's clear that we 
don't want to get involved with 
government, or feel we don't have 
to for things to run reasonably 
smooth. Thus, our elected repre-
sentatives should hardly concern 
themselves with dragging more 
people into the long meetings, 
drafting of resolutions and paper-
work of UCSD student govern-
ment. Very few of us are "student 
government types," which is for 
the best - if we were all intense-
ly interested in the issues con-
cerning the A.S . Council, no deci-
sions would ever be made. 

Lying behind the candidates' 
basically identical campaign 
promises lies a fundamental con-
fusion and disagreement over the 
role the A.S. Council should play 
within UCSD, San Diego and 
California. This confusion should 
be explicitly addressed as next 
year's A.S. Council is assembled, 
for a government needs to under-
sund its role before it proceeds 
with anything else. 

Present council members are 
often maligned for allegedly wast-
ing time on resolutions regarding 
sute or national political issues. 
It's healthy for our student gov-
ernment to be aware of issues 
larger than the university, but 
needless to say, concerns immedi-
ate to UCSD should be a higher 
priority than drafting such resolu-
tions. The disagreement about the 
usefulness of these resol utions 
reflects this basic tension between 
what the councilmembers want to 
do and what they were elected to 
accomplish - as does this current 
spat of misguided campaign 
promises. 

The new A.S. Council would 
be well-served to get back to 
basics and realize that it serves the 
students, and the average student 
simply doesn't desire to become 
embroiled in the council's weighty 
but bureaucratic affairs.

Runoff: York endorses

Some members of the Unity 
slate also attended a meeting right 
after results were announced to 
work 00 Pae's campaign, according 
to Copn, though he said that the 
slate's backing was not unanimous. 

"After talking to a lot of people

Eric Guico, who finished in 6rst 
place, automatically becomes one 
of the colle,e's at-large candidates. 

Though no at-lar,e candidates at 
Eleanor Roosevelt CoIIe,e received 
the plurality of votes, coIle,e elec-
tion officials chose not to use the 
runoff' system, Chapman said. 

The A.S. Council voted last year 
to implement an instant runoff vot-

Second inde-
pendent candidate 
Kris Saradpon said 
he was undecided. 

Though no 
contender for A.S. 
commissioner of 
communications 
received more than 
50 percent of the 
general vote, the 
number required 
to win in the regu-
lar election, Unity's 
Emily Castor with-
drew her candidacy 

I feel at this point 
that I would like to 

~UPport Hillary 
because I feel she is 

ing system in cam-
puswide elections. 
Under the plan, 
voters would rate 
all candidates by 
preference, and if 
none received the 
majority of first-
choice ratings, the 
arrangement would 
have eliminated the 
least popular candi-
da tes and trans-
ferred their support 
to the voters' sec-
ond-choice. This 
would continue 

more qualified. " 

an hour after learning she would 
face Hillary Elder of Students 
First! in a runoff. Finishing second 
in the general election, Castor 
trailed Elder by 140 votes. 

"I feel at this point that I would 
like to support Hillary because I 
feel she is more qualified," said 
Castor, stopping short of a full 
endorsement. "Out of the candi-
dates that are remaining, she is the 
choice I that I would place above 
my owI\ candidacy."

until one candidate 
finally achieved the support of 
more than half of the voters. 

However, after StudentLinlc pro-
grammers announced that they 
would not finish the IRV system in 
time, the council chose to allocate 
the last two days of the election 
period for a separate runoff election. 

As in the general election, voters 
will cast ballots on StudentLinlc or 
on library walk, though the ballot 
will be much shoner and will fit on 
a single page, Chapman said. 

Voting for the runoff election 
will end at 4 p.m. on April 9.

commissioner of student services 
and Angela Fornero for commis-
sioner of enterprise operations. 

The position of president will be 
decided in a runoff vote, which will 
take place April 8 and April 9. 
Independent presidential candidate 
Jenn Pae, who garnered 1,138 
votes, will face Students First! can-
didate Harish Nandagopal, who 
won 916 votes. 

"There were a lot of people who 
helped me, and I wish I could thank 
them all," Pae said. "My hope is ... 
to continue what I've been doing 
and to put myself out ¢ere." 

Nandagopal stressed the impor-
tance of voter turnout in the runoff 
elections. 

"I'm pretty happy right now," 
Nandagopal said. "We've just got 
to get people out to vote. That's all 
there is to 't." 

Hillary Elder of Students First! 
was set to face Emily Castor of 
Unity in a runoff for the position of 
commissioner of communications, 
but Castor withdrew following the 
announcement of the results. 

Students First! slate members 
celebrated following the 
announced results. 

"I loved everybody 1 worked 
with [and) I'm so happy for them 
all," Yapuco said. "Today was really 
hard because we had all those 
grievances filed against us at the 
very last minute, so it was all really 
stressful, but it all paid off." 

Unity slate presidential candi-
date Jeremy Cogan thanked his 
slate members for their effort dur-
ing the elections. 

"I feel good about having done 
this," Cogan said. "I will never be 
more proud of a group of candi-
dates than those I ran with ... 1 will 
always be proud of them." 

Unity candidate for vice presi-
dent finance Denis. Shmidt echoed

the sentiment. 

"I feel pretty upset, of.coUrse, but 
it was a good fight," Shmidt said. 

According to A.S. executive sec-
retary Kyle Nakanishi, student 
tumOUt for the election increased by 
0.7 percent compared to last year, 
with 3,497 students casting ballots, 
or 17.8 percent of the student body. 

"I'm glad we had students come 
out," AS. Elections Manager Tom 
Chapman said. "I think we had a 
pretty good percentage for only 
three days of voting." 

In a grievance filed against 
Students First! by John Muir 
College senior Konstantinos 
Roditis, the Elections Committee 
found that the slate violated UCSD 
posting policies on two counts -
once for using tape instead of 
string to hold up a poster, and once 
for not including a contact number 
on a poster. The committee gave 
the slate one point toward disqual-
ification for the violations. In a 
grievance filed against Students 
First! by student Adam Richards, 
the committee ruled in favor of the 
slate, throwing OUt the claim that 

they put up posters at Earl's Pla.ce 
for lack cj evidence, and ruling that 
Nandagopal's speech during the 
March 30 John Kerry rally did not 
constitute a campaign contribution 
from Kerry. The committee ruled 
against the s1a te for using issues of 
the Nrw I"diatars to weight 
posters in a case brought by Muir 
senior Bryan Barton, asse56ing the 
slate another point toward disqual-
ification. A fourth grievance, filed 
by Muir sophomore senator candi-
date and Unity slate member Lulu 
Ge, was withdrawn. 

"I thought [elections were) a lot 
dirtier than I expected, but our slate 
was so close," Song said. aI think 
we're reaDy going to be able to do a 
lot in office next year because we 
have the support and general goals 
that we all want to work on." 

Results for the second 
Thurgood Marshall College at-
large representative will be deter-
mined through runoff voting.

THURSDAY, APRil 8, 2004 

Boasting crudely titled animated shorts such as "Hut Sluts," "How to Cope With Death," 
"Petting in the Park." '"The Big 

Abandoned Refrigerator 
Adventure" and the trankly stated 
"My First Boner," Spike and Mike's 
Sick and Twisted Festival of 
Animation leaves little to the imag-
ination. 

The festival, widely regarded 
for its irreverent and macabre sense 
of humor, has generated fandom 
even among the international com-
munity, appearing at the long-
established, high brow art-film epi-
center, Cannes Film Festival, and 
soon hoping to broaden its tenure 
to Japan. And while the Sick and 
Twisted festival, in its all-star sta-
tus, has stretched trom venues 
ranging from crowded soccer 6e1ds 
in Annecy, France to the Sundance 
and SI.mdance film festivals, it has 

aI~ys .felt most at home in 
California. 

Yet the festival's affection for 
the Golden State is at best a pecu-
liar one - probably best evi-
denced in the 10-6 short, MHut 
Sluts," a local favorite that depicts 
the off-kilter beach culture of La 
Jolla. The short follows the mean-
dering narrative of two vapid, 
flaxen-haired women who eventu-
ally faU into sexual depravity in 
me vein of "Last Tango in Paris." 

Based out of Riverside, Calif., 
Craig "Spike" Decker, and Mike 
Gribble (deceased, 1994), two 
self-described Mu-hippies," first 
conceived the idea for a shon-ani-
mation festival devoted solely to 

the fringes of independent, sub-
culture animation in the late 
19705. During Spike's stint as a 
bass vocalist for a local Riverside 
'50s style rock band, the two 
screened kitschy clips of dated 
19405 "Superman" and "Betty 
Boop" cartoons, "Star Trek" 
bloopers, and animated cult 
favorites, such as Marv Newland's 
"Bambi Meets Godzilla." Demand 
for the duo's eclectic film selec-
tions soon outstripped the popu-
larity of the band itself. Spike and 
Mike took the hint and founded 
Mellow Manners Production in 
1977, named after a Riverside art 
commune, and began producing 
animated shorts. 

The first offshoot of Mellow 
MaMers Production was Spike and 
Mike's Classic Festival of 
Animation, which claims such 
famous alumni as Tim Burton 
("The Nightmare aefore 
Christmas,,), Nick Park ("The 
Wallace and Gromit Serial,,), Bill 
Plympton ("I Married a Strange 
Person!"), and even the figureheads 
of the now ubiquitous Pinr 
Productions, Pete Docter and 
Andrew Stanton. 

Counterpoised with this collec-
tion of sentimental and often 
adonbly cute shorts is the Sick and 
Twisted Festival, begun in 1990. 
With meager beginnings at 
Riverside City College and a mis-
sion of "overcoming the stigma of 
Disney and Bugs Bunny," the festi-
val has since snowballed into a 
nationwide cult favorite. And fit-
tingly for this alternative festival, 

Film review: 
'Ella Enchanted' 

is a channer

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

the list of featured artists reads like 
a roll call of animators that couldn't 
be any further from Walt Disney: 
Mike Judge ("Beavis and 
Butthead"), Matt Stone and Trey 
Parker ("South Park,,), and Eric 
Fogel ("Celebrity Deathmatch,,). 

Currently, along with other 
Sick and Twisted West Coast fes-
tivals in cities such as Santa 
Barbara, Calif., and Portland, 
Ore., Spike and Mike's Festival 
has encamped at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art, San Diego in 
LaJolla. With a rich history at the 
La Jolla MCASD, once known for 
its raucous midnight shows, this 
year's lineup includes shorts 
which Spike calls "the best quality 
in years," ranging from basic 
hand-drawn cartoons to the pol-
ished-glimmer of CGI. 

Several highlights from this 
year's run are Breehn Burns and 
Jason Johnson's highly regarded 
3-D gem (free 3-D glasses with 
every ticket) "Here Comes Dr. 
Tran," and their perverse earlier 
work, "Beyond Grandpa." Other 
entries include Lane Nakamura's 
CGI-crafted "Snowman"; "Old 
Folks Love" and "Petting in the 
Park" by the incomparable car-
toon sadist Bill Plympton; "No 
Neck Joe" by Power Puff Girl 
progenitor Craig McCraclcen; and 
Mondo Media's "Happy Tree 
Friends," figuring Pokemon-like 
creatures as not-so-Pikachu-
friendly. 

It's been a long, hard road since

seedy rocIc 'n' roll lairs. But with a

Decker isn't surprised in the

10 HIATIJS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Company educates and entertains 
Bold choreography and music highlighted in performances 

By JESSICA LONG 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Parsons Dance Company will take the stage at Mandeville Auditorium for 
an evening of energetic and ath-
letic dance on April 14. Headed 
by David Parson, who has been 
hailed as one of the most promis-
ing choreographers of his genera-
tion, the dance company has been 
praised for delivering perfor-
mances that are exhilarating and 
captivating. 

For almost 10 years, Parson 
performed as a leading dancer 
with [he Paul Taylor Dance 
Company as well as making guest 
appearances with New York City 
Ballet, ine Berlin Opera, MOMIX 
and the White Oak Dance 
Project. In 1987, Parson left Paul 
Taylor Dance Company and 
founded the dance company that 
now bears his name. He started 
the company with lighting design-
er Howell Binkley in order to give 

himself a venue for creating his 
own work. 

Specifically, Parson wanted to 
create work that focuses on collab-
oration with composers and lead-
ing artists in theatrical design. In 
faCt, out of the more than 60 pieces 
that Parson has choreographed for 
his company, 20 of them have 
unique commissioned scores. 

Not only does Parson choreo-
graph for his own company, but 
he has received commissions from 
American Ballet Theatre, New 
York City Ballet, Alvin Ailey 
American Dance Theatre, the 
American Dance Festival, the 
Spoleto Festival, Het 
Muziektheater in Amsterdam, 
Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, and 
now Paul Taylor Dance Company. 
While he works on these projects, 
he also allows dancers in his com-
pany to choreograph for them-
selves. 

Parson is not only interested in 
creating dance, but also in educat-
ing the public about it. The com-

Dance 
PREVIEW 

pany conducts tours around the 
country and has residency compo-
nents in Wisconsin, Delaware and 
Ohio. The Parsons Dance 
Company is well known for their 
lectures, symposia, workshops and 
master classes that are offered to 
the communities in which they 
perform. 

'The Parsons Dance Company 
is made up of nine dancers who 
indulge in Parson's brilliant and 
daring choreography. The compa-
ny will perform at Mandeville 
Auditorium on April 14. Tickets 
are $27 for the general public; $26 
for faculty, staff and senior citi-
zens; and S 15 for students. and 
can be purchased online at

'Girl Next Door' is not another teen movie 
Film is a strange mix between the funny and the not-so-funny 

By vu MAl • 
Staff Writer F II m 

Seductive shots of a woman's mouth forming suggestive and inviting expressions appear 
while a cheeky trail of male whis-
pers fade in and out with porn-
esque music. Another sequel to "9 
112 Weeks?" No, it's actually the 
beginning of "The Girl Next 
Door." What was expected to be 
another B-class teen flick actually 
grabs the movie-viewer's attention 
as something more. 

Narurally, the enticing intro-
duction rurns out to be nothing 
more than a misleading scene of a 
high-school senior picrure day (a 
sneaky test for the dirty mind). 
With this comes the realization 
that the film rests upon a basic 
"coming-of-age" plot about a 
righteous high school senior, 
Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch, 
"The Emperor's Club"), deciding 
between doing the right thing and 
doing the wrong thing for the 
right reason after he meets the 
love of his life, Danielle (Elisha 
Cuthbert, "Love Actually") . 
However, things become interest-
ing when Matthew finds out that 
his mysterious hottie is actually a 
bona fide porn star. 

~ REVIEW 
Unfortunately, "The Girl 

Next Door" cannot possibly 
make it up to the high-quality 
line with the mediocre perfor-
mances delivered by Kidman and 
Cuthbert, who have almost no 
chemistry together. It would be 
nice to see Cuthbert in some 
other role than the risque sex-
goddess ("I'm all wet, can I come 
inside?"). By the end, you'll real-
ize that the entire time you've 
been paying more attention to 
the secondary actors and graru-
itous cameos by silicon implants 
than to the principal actors and 
their so-called "obstacles." The 
effort is very cute, but sadly the 
movie could have been just as 
funny without it. 

Still, the film manages to up 
the ante with quite a few thrilling 
antics. Who can say no to the 
uproarious acting by Timothy 
Olyphant ("Rock Star") as Kelly, 
Danielle's misfit porn-star pimp? 
He and other bizarre men chase 
between Hirsch and a nearly 
naked James Remar ("Sex and the 

City"), who plays snazzy porn 
king Hugo Posch. The intrigue of 
the film proves (in a good way) to 
be a little racier than expected 
with its ballsy appeal. Several 
scenes actually keep your interest 
perked and ultimately turn out to 
be quite clever. 

Yes, "The Girl Next Door" 
should inevitably be categorized 
as a second-rate teen movie. But 
all in all, kudos to director Luke 
Greenfield and co-writers David 
Wagner and Brent Gold~rg for 
refraining from adding a stoner 
friend and too many staged high 
school parties with suspiciously 
old-looking high-schoolers. "The 
Girl Next Door" is more unique 
than the otherwise archetypal 
teen-comedy. It's no film classic, 
but aside from the disappointing 
acting, it does loyally deliver what 
it is supposed to - some good, 
old, twisted humor.

'Ella Enchanted' is a sweet 
treat with an all-star cast 

Fairy tale a cute, funny yet flawed 
story for a new generation of viewers 

By ANNE CONCi-HUYEN 
Hiatus Editor 

I t's about time another live-action fairy tale film was made for kids, because lcids today haven't got 
the same array of fantasy movies like 
"The Princess Bride" and "Legend" 
that are both intelligent II1Id fanciful. 
Although "EJla Enchanted" leaves 
much to be desired, it ultimately suc-
ceeds in being a cute and fun movie 
with likable characters and lively, 
colorful settings. 

The tale is a simple one, sott of. 
Ella (Anne Hathaway of "The 
Princess Diaries" and "Nicholas 
Nicldeby") is a beautiful maiden 
who is enchanted (or cursed, either 
way) with absolute obedience. If 
anyone makes the slightest com-
mand ("Ella, hold your tongue!") 
she cannot help but to obey. So our 
darling heroine must go off and 
find her fairy godmother (Vivica A. 
Fox) to take back the gift. Along the 
way Ella finds true love with the 
handsome prince (of course), meets 
an elf with aspirations of becoming 
a lawyer, and gets rescued from a 
blue giant with a plumber's crack. 

So the cinematic journey begins, 
and what a surprisingly enjoyable 
one it is, complete with allusions to 
present-day politics and pop culture 
and an all-star cast that is undoubt-
edly having fun making their own 
rules. Sure, the acting isn't quite of 
the award-winning caliber, but that's 
not the point with films like this. 

The talented actors playoff of 
one another very weD and mak:e what 
could be a laughable attempt at a 
film a rather enjoyable one. Cary 
E1wes returns to the humor fantasy 
genre to play the Regent Prince 
Edgar (thinlc. Prince Humperdink of 
Princess Bride, only he sings "Shake 
Your Booty") and his regent prince is 
one sly yet silly evil-doer. Minnie 
Driver ("Good Will Hunting", 
"Return to Me") plays the defunct 
house fairy Mandy who is adorable, 
yet annoyingly bereft of any agency. 
Not much can be said of our hero-
ine, who is for the most part simply 
pretty . and likable. It is incredibly 
refreshing, however, to see a fairy

tale heroine who is not a demure and 
simple girl who waits for fortune and 
happiness to come to her. Instead she 
is one with spunk. who rejects the 
prince and who attends the prince's 
pre-coronation rally to protest seg-
regation of giants, ogres and elves 
("Say no to ogre-cidelj. Hathaway 
does a decent job of presenting a new 
female role model who breaks with 
the convention of female obedience. 

Special commendations must be 
made to the evil stepmother and 
stepsisters, however, who succeed 
in being incredibly disagreeable 
and comical at the same time. 
Joanna Lumley (one of the comic 
geniuses behind "Absolutely 
Fabulousj plays the wicked step-
mother Dame Olga perfectly. She 
is vain to the point of near self-
destruction and is a lot of fun to 
watch. Lucy Punch, as the blonde 
wannabe bombshell stepsister 
Hattie, is the real gem of the film. 
Great care was put into the charac-
terization of the clever Hattie, who 
is the president of the Prince 
Charmont Fan Club and insanely 
jealous of his affection for her step-
sister, and if is palpable in Punch's 
portrayal of her. 

Of course, "Ella Enchanted" can-
not quite compare to "The Princess 
Bride" or even "Shrek", but it is 
without a doubt a much needed 
comic fantasy film appropriate for 
people of all ages. Sure it's meant for 
kids, but most people will appreciate 
the clever one-I i ners ("If the gauntlet 
doesn't fit, you must acquit!j, the 
bright and lively settings, and, of 
course, the great music.

West's approach of sampling old-school

two fieriest examples are "Slow Jarnz" and

West's rapping skills are often doubted, 
but more often than not, he's up to the task. 
His rhymes are deeply affecting on the amaz-
ing "All _ails Down." They range from 
hilarious to tasteless on "Never Let Me

The SO-SO state of 'LelD': .

Writer/director Matthew Ryan Hoge of "The United States of Leland" has stated that 
with this film, he attempts to get 
away from exploiting the criminal

Social dance: The dirt behind dirty dancing Leland: Film provides more 
questions 

than answers 
Despite the popular belief, the bump 'n' grind is not dancing 

short kids 
are cool 

Jessica Long 

What has happened to social dance lately? Now, you are most likely 
wondering what I'm talking about. 
Let me explain. Throughout his-
tory, Americans have come 
together to dance. Waltzing, jit-
terbug, swing, even disco: Specific 
dances with specific steps that 
took at least a modicum of talent 
and practice to perform. 

we went to checlt out some of the 
bands. We found a band doing 
covers of popular songs and decid-
ed to stick around. What better 
way to celebrate than watching 
white men with afros try to rap? 

Anyway, we spent more time 
trying to ward off advances from 
guys than we did actually dancing. 
After trying to explain to guys that 
were obviously drunk, way too 

" 

may be. There are no specific 
steps anymore, most likely because 
the majority of people can't do 
more than bob and shake in place 
while wearing three-inch heels, 
skin-tight pants and low-cut shirts 
that have been deemed proper 
dancing attire these days. 

Are we really so starved for sex 
that we feel the need to imitate it 
while (barely) clothed in the mid-

old, or otherwise 
just creepy, I final-
ly let a guy dance 
with me. Way back when, 

people ..oould ask 
one arwther if they 
wanted to dance, 

dle of a dance 
floor? Or are we 
just so unimagina-
tive that this is the 
best we can come 
up with? 

1n any case, it's 
more than a little 
pathetic. 

But not anymore. What does 
our generation have? Freaking. 

There are no steps anymore. 
Just bumping and grinding against 
another person. Or even thin air. 

Well, this guy 
thought that 
because I let him 
into my personal 
space, he was 
allowed to touch 
me. I was distract-
ed from dancing 
by trying to keep 
him from grab-
bing my ass every 
time I moved. 
Since 1 did let him 

Now don't get 
me wrong, I have Not anymore. nothing against 
dancing that looks These days " it's grab sexy and might 

What makes a good dancer at a 
club these days? Whoever can 
make people want to get with 
them the most. No need for talent, 
just a vague sense of rhythm or a 
willingness to shake your ass while 
wearing tight pants. 

firs and ask J _6- " even . be a bit t 1UleT. shocking. I mean, 

And there is no etiquette these 
days. Way back when, people would 
ask one another if they wanted to 
dance. Not anymore. These days, 
it's grab first and ask later, 

Case in point: One of my 
friends and I went down to the 
Gaslamp District for Mardi Gras 
this year. After a fabulous dinner, 

keep dancing with me, he figured 
he had the right to stick his tongue 
in my mouth. He was wrong. 

After removing him from my 
personal space, I was forced to do 
what my sister calls "playing the les-
bian card," which means I told the 
guy that my friend was in fact my 
girlfriend. Luckily, he fell for it. 

And thati where we are today. 
Our dance is simply gyrating, 
pulsing, thrusting against our 
partner or partners - as the case 

when waltzing first 
became popular, it was scandalous 
because men and women were 
(gasp!) touching each other, The 
twist horrified parents because their 
children were (oh the horror!) mov-
ing their pelvises. But I think it's 
gone just a little too far these days. 

I'm sure it all started out as a 
good thing. Just look back at 
"Dirty Dancing." Oh come on, I 
know you've all seen it at least 
once. The dancing was sexual, but 
it still looked as if it required a

scrap of talent to perform. And 
you had to dance with a parmer. 

Now it's just dancing on your 
parmer. Loole at the "Real World" 
or some of the other reality shows 
(don't get me started) that have 
popped up to copy. All you have to 
do to be considered a good dancer 
is be willing to dry hump your part-
ner in public. And of course this is 
being perpetuated in movies and 
television shows. I've been told it 
has in the episode "The Escape" on 
the 'IV show "The O.c." (Though 
I can't claim to know for sure as I've 
been avoiding this show since it 
came out, but I won't go there ... 
this time.) 

And when did we become so 
voyeuristic that we wanted to 
watch this? If you want to watch 
people get it on, go buy some 
porn. When did we become such 
exhibitionists that we willingly go 
into clubs and let people watch us 
do this? The way some people 
dance these days, they might as 
well incorporate a pole and get 
paid for it. 

Does anyone really think that 
there is any shock value left in 
this anymore? Television com-
mercials show sweaty bodies 
jostling around on a dance floor 
to advertise everything from 
alcohol to deodorant. 

So why don't we do ourselves, 
and the rest of the world, a favor 
- leave the foreplay in the bed-
room and bring dance back to the 
dance floor. 

cominued from page 12 
Klein subtly captures the essence 
of a helpful boy overwhelmed by 
inner rage. Lena O li n and Kevin 
Spacey pulsate wi th energy as 
Leland 's paren ts, and Martin 
Donovan is compelling as a griev-
ing father. 

The film raises several ques-
tions, particularly regarding the 
characters' impulses. yet it pro-
vides very few answers. The motive 
for murder remains unclear. T his 
state of ambiguity makes the film 
interesting because it inspires dif-
ferent interpretations, but at the 
same time it causes it to become 
somewhat tiresome and difficult to 
digest. The plodine of a too-good 
criminal who teaches Pearl about 
life and love is a stretch, the other 
subplots are a bit tOO contrived, 
and at different moments, some 
characters almost become carica-
tures. 

Yet, with all of its faults, "The 
United States of Leland" has a few 
poignant thoughts to offer. It is 
entertaining to watch some of its 
actors delve into deep emotional 
reserves, even if they often have lit-
tle to say.

THURSDAY, APRIL 8, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

I CLUB spons 
Dancesport 

The UCSD dancesport team 
took first place at the prestigious 
San Francisco Open competition 
on the weekend of April 2 through 
April 4. The event, held at the San 
Francisco Marriott, attracts com-
petitors from all over the world. 
UCSD competed in the formation 
team event, which features seven 
teams from California colleges and 
studios. 

The tcam performed its exciting 
punk-rock No Doubt-inspired 
Latin medley routine, impressing 
judges with its technically sound 
dancing and charisma. Final point 
totals gave UCSD first place, well 
ahead of runner-up Claremont 
College. 

"Claremont looked really 
clean," said UCSD co-captain 
Lawrence Ortiguerra. "Their 
lines were nice, their dancing was 
nice ... everything was nice. The 
difference was that we just had 
that extra difficulty, that extra 
excitement that won over the 
judges." 

With the team's multiple wins at 
tough competitions, co-captain 
Lindy Cabot is optimistic about 
the remainder of the season. 

"This year's team is amazing," 
she said. "They arc talented, 
enthusiastic and incredibly hard-
working. They always give their 
best effort, and I think that this 
competition has set a great stan-
dard for the rest of our season." 

The team leaves April 9 for its 
nen competition a.t Stanford. 

Dance tcam 
The UCSD dance team placed 

third at the National 
Cheerleaders Association/ 
National Dance Alliance 
Collegiate Nationals in Daytona 
Beach, Fla., held April 1 through 
April 8. It is the largest and most 
competitive collegiate dance com-
petition in the world. 

UCSD competed against 18 
other Division II schools from 
around the world in the five-day 
tournament, taking third place 
behind Japan's Tamagawa 
University and Hawaii Pacific 
University. The preliminary round 
on April 1 landed UCSD in sixth 
place, but the team was able to step 
it up a few notches for the finals on 
April 2. 

The third-place finish is the 
dance team's highest finish at 
Nationals in four years. Earlier this 
year, the team earned a first-place 
win at the College of the Adantic 
Collegiate Championships. 

The NCAINDA Nationals are 
scheduled to be televised on Fox 
Sport Net in late April. The exact 
date and time were unavailable at 
press time. 

Equestrian 
The UCSD equestrian team 

sent five riders to Twin Falls, 
Idaho, April 2 through April 4 to 
compete in the Zone 8 
Intercollegiate Horse Show 
Association Championships hosted 
by the College of Southern Idaho. 

Although just two points held 
the Tritons back from sending the 
entire English team to Zone 8, they 
were well-represented by senior 
Linda Torres, junior co-captains 
Maree Evans and Kate McComas, 
junior Shannon Ward and sopho-
more Alicia Cunningham-Bryant. 

Torres finished first in 
Intermediate Fences, fourrh in 
Open Flat and seventh in Western 
Open Horsemanship. Evans took 
second place in Novice Fences, 
while M,<:Omas finished fourth in 
Open Fences. Ward placed first in 
Walk-Trot-Canter Equitation and 
Cunningham-Bryant landed an 
eighth-place finish in Western 
Intermediate Horsemanship. 

The top-two riders in each class 
qualified to compete at IHSA 
Nationals at Middle Tennessee 
State University in Murfreesboro, 
Tenn., from May 6 through May 9. 
Evans, Torres and Ward will repre-
sent UCSD. Riders in IHSA con-
tests compete on borrowed horses 
in both Western and English equi-
tation, where the rider is judged on 
her ability to communicate with 
the horse on the flat, in English 
courses with fences ranging from 2 
feet, 3 inches to 3-3, and in 
Western patterns. 

Badminton 
On April 3, the undefeated and 

reigning national champion UCSD 
badminton team won its final 
league game of the season against 
San Diego State. The win secured 
UCSD a second consecutive con-

ference championship. 
UCSD took the win over 

SDSU, 11-4. The combined point 
totals of the men's and women's 
sides needed to be at least a total of 
eight in order to win the game. 

UCSD badminton is training 
hard for the upcoming 
Intercollegiate National 
Badminton Championship, to be 
held at Stanford May 7 though 
May 9. The team will defend its 
national tide - a lofty goal, espe-
cially after losing three of its start-
ing players last year due to gradua-
tion. Nevertheless, the team is 
proud of its conference champi-
onship victory and loolcs to win it 
all again nen season. 

TriathaloD 
The UCSD triathlon team 

began its season at Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo on March 13. The 
team traveled north to compete in 
Cal Poly's annual March Warm-
Up and began the West Coast 
Collegiate Series. The team placed 
second, behind UC Berkeley and 
ahead of Cal Poly. The teams are 
scored by combining the times of 
the top three male and female 
triathletes. UCSD's scoring ath-
letes were Sharon Bergquin, 
Natasha Cridler, Emily Vala-
Haynes, Brendan O'Brien, Daniel 
Dcrkacs and John Burke. Outside 
of the Collegiate Division, O'Brien 
placed first overall and Derkacs 
placed fourth. Andrea Collopy, 
Alex Banos and Richard Ahn com-
pleted their first triathlon. The 
team's nen race will be at Lake 
Havasu for the Collegiate 
Nationals on April 24, in Havasu, 
Ariz.

PhoIo courtesy tl UCSD AeaeIIion 
Hoof It: The Tritons' equestrian team held its own at the Zone 8 Intercollegiate 
Horse ShON Association Championships in Idaho, earning several top honors. 

Track: Steeplechasers come through in clutch 
continued from page 20 

fourth-best all-time position at 
UCSD. 

Senior Pat Runinger put in a 
solid ninth-place finish in the pole 
vault, reaching a height of 15-1, 
which, likewise, put him at ninth 
place in the UCSD record books. 

"On the women's side, Michelle 
DiMeo had a great meet, placing 
sinh with an NCAA qualifying 
time," Salerno said. 

DiMeo, a sophomore, compet-
ed in the 1,500-meter, racing 
4:38.10, an NCAA Provisional 
Qualifier time that also enabled her 
to leap to the third-best all-time 
position for the event at UCSD. 

Sophomore school-record-
holder Kaylin Siever leapt 39'S" to 
place fourth in the triple jump. 

The 1,600-meter relay team, 
comprised of senion Elizabeth Tsu, 
Hillary Mills and Clan Wilson, 
with freshman Elisa Holiday, fin-
ished in 3:54.06. The time gave 

them a seventh-place finish at the 
meet and the second-best all-time 
position for UCSD. 

"Clara Wilson was also a stand-
out, placing seventh in the 400 
intermediate hurdles with an 
NCAA qualifying time," Salerno 
said. 

Mills and Wilson also gave 
exemplary respective performances 
in the 4OO-meter hurdles. While 
Wilson was seventh in the event 
with a time of 1:03.11, Mills was 
ninth with a time of 1 :04.58. Both 
women were named NCAA 
Provisional Qualifiers. 

Freshman Brenda Stevens 
scored a ninth-place showing in the 
3,OOO-meter steeplechase, finishing 
in 11 :34.55, which made her the 
third-best all-time athlete in that 
event. 

The UCSD women ranked 
13th among 20 participants in the 
team standings with 18 points. San 
Diego State garnered 167 points, 

enough to earn it a first-place over-
all finish among the women's 
teams. 

To prepare for the meet, many 
members of the team rested dur-
ing the week prior to competing. 
The team will use the same strat-
egy for nen week's meet at UC 
Riverside in order to conserve its 
strength for major meets in the 
future. 

"We will field as competitive a 
squad as we can, but may rest some 
people who competed this week at 
San Luis Obispo as we prepare for 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championship meet in 
May," Salerno said. 

UCSD will be back in action at 
UC Riverside on April 10, compet-
ing against Division I schools 
including Southern Utah 
University and UC Riverside, 
along with Division IT Claremont 
and Division II conference rival 
Cal Poly Pomona.

After a frustrating spring break 
performance. the UCSD softball 
team continued to struggle at the 
Easton Tournament of 
Champions on April 2 through 
April 4, held in Modesto, Calif., 
winning only two of its five 
games. 

UCSD started the tournament 
on a high note, defeating Western 
Oregon in its first game, 8-6. 
Offense was in full effect for the 
Tritons, who started off the first 
game with an RBI double by 
senior second baseman Kim 
Aggabao, scoring senior third 
baseman Amy Mettee. UCSD 
added three more runs in the 
fourth inning and two more in the 
fifth. jumping out to an early 6-0 
lead. 

Western Oregon managed to 
tie the game at six, but in enra 
innings, Aggabao got a two-run 
single, giving UCSD an 8-6 
advantage, good enough for the 
victory. Aggabao went 4-for-5, 
with four RBIs. Mettee went 2-
for-4 on the day. also added an 
RBI. and crossed the plate three 
times. Sophomore outfielder Niki 
Anderson provided another RBI 
and scored once while going one-
for-three. Sophomore shortstop 
Desiree Franciscus. sophomore 
outfielder Jenny Spencer, junior 
catcher Jamie Hurst, and senior 
first baseman Jodie Bland added 
two hits each. 

Freshman starter Tina Rowe, 
sidelined earlier in the season 
due to a back injury, threw five 
solid innings, giving up only one 
run. However, the wheels fell off 
in the sixth, as "she gave up five 
runs, including the game-tying 
run. She left the game with a no-
decision. Junior Kelley Bryant 

finished the sixth inning for 
Rowe, and the game for the 
Tritons, pitching 2.1 innings of 
scoreless relief, netting her third 
win on the season and bringing 
her record to 3-2. 

In its next game of the tourna-
ment, UCSD took on the 
University of Hawaii-Hilo. The 
Vulcans quickly jumped to a 7-0 
lead off starting pitcher Bland, 
who Jave up seven runs. six 
eame , in 2.1 innings. This out-
ing resulted in her ninth loss of 
the season and brought her record 
to 9-9. Bryant provided 4.2 
innings of relief, giving up only 
one run, but Hawaii-Hilo already 
had enough to solidify its 8-4 vic-
tory. 

Offense was spotty for the 
Tritons, who scored one run in the 
third and fourth innings and two 
in the fifth. Spencer led the team 
with a 3-for-4 performance. two 
of her hits doubles, and knocking 
in two runs. Hurst went 2-for-4 
and scored twice, while netting an 
RBI. Mettee and junior outfielder 
Breanne Cope scored the other 
two runs, while freshman catcher 
Nildci Palmer knocked in the final 
run for UCSD. 

The second day of the tourna-
ment found the Tritons much 
worse off, as they lost their first 
game to Hawaii Pacific, 9-0, in 
five innings. Rowe started the 
game but was knocked out after 
only 1.2 innings of pitching. She 
gave up five earned runs and lost 
her fourth game of the season, 
dropping her record to 7-4. 
Bryant came in to throw 3.1 
innings of relief, but gave up four 
more runs. two earned. She fin-
ished the game with a no-deci-
sion. 

UCSD managed to put togeth-
er three hits for the game, coming 
from Mettee, Aggabao and 

Spencer. 
Unfortunately, the second 

game on April 4 was not much dif-
ferent for the Tritons, who fell to 
Western New Mezico. 8-0, in six 
innings. Bryant started the game 
and pitched 2.2 innings. but gave 
up three unearned runs. Despite 
this, she still took the loss. bring-
ing her record to 3-3 on the sea-
son. Franciscus pitched three 
innings in relief, allowing five 
runs, three of them earned, and 
came away with a no-decision. 

The four hits of the game came 
from Mettee, Franciscus, Aggabao 
and freshman outfielder Brittni 
Carino. 

The Tritons finally turned the 
tables on April 4. blanking oppo-
nent Cal State San Bernardino. 8-
0, in five innings. Bland pitched a 
masterful complete-game shutout, 
giving her a 10th win on the sea-
son and placing her record at 10-9 
on the year. 

The bats awoke for the 
Tritons, who scored one run in 
the second inning, four in the 
third and three more in the 
fourth. Franciscus provided the 
most fireworks. going 2-for-3 
with two RBis and two runs 
scored. Joining her with big num-
bers was Hurst, who went 2-for-
2, crossing the plate twice and 
grabbing an RBI. Teammate 
Aggabao also scored twice and 
had an RBI. going 2-for-3. 
Spencer provided both another 
run and an RBI with II I-for-3 
outing, while Mettee scored the 
remaining run off an Anderson 
hit. 

UCSD will be back in action 
on April 7 when the Tritons takes 
on Point Loma Nazarene in a 
two-game doubleheader that will 
be held at Point Loma. Cali£. 
The results of this game were not 
available at press time. 

"(The series at UC Davis) was a 
tough weekend for us. but the 
weekend is over and now it's time 
to get ready fo r our next battle." 
UCS D head coach Dan 'O'Brien 
said. "Great teams can rake blows 
li ke this and move forward , and 
that's just what we'll do." 

Triton junior second baseman 
Ricky Pinocchio tripled in the top 
of the fourth inning and scored on 
a wild pitch from UC Davis start-
ing pitcher Travis Bearden. pulling 
UCSD to within one. 

Women's crew: Second to Western Washington 

In game two, the Tritons put 
up three runs in the top of the 
fi rst inning, which would turn out 
to be the only runs scored by 
UCSD in the contest. T he Aggies 
countered with two runs in the 
bottom half of t he second inning 
before scoring three additional

The positive results on April 3 

bode particularly well for key

decision to skip this year's San

held April 3 and April 4 at Mission

UCSD reaches· third in conference 
Womens tennis goes 1-2 at Florida Tournament 

By ANGELA UN 
Staff Writer 

On the weekend of April 2 
through April 4. the UCSD 
women's tennis team treldced 
across the nation to play at the 
University of West Florida 
Invitational in Pensacola, Fla. The 
women faced a difficult field from 
around the country, including top-
ranked BYU-Hawaii and fourth-
ranked West Florida. Despite the 
tough competition, the Tritons 
managed to pull a win out of the 
tournament. making their tourna-
ment record 1-2. 

On April 4, the Tritons lost a 
close match to fourth-ranked West 
Florida, 3-6. The Tritons lost all 
three doubles matches, with sopho-
more Tara Siddiqui and freshman 
Katie Bronowiclti losing a close 9-7 
match at No. 2 doubles. 

Despite the initial setback, the 
women were able to put three 
points on the board, with big wins 
by freshman Katie McKee at No. 6 
singles. Siddiqui at No. 3 singles 
,and sophomore Leigh Roberts at 
No. 4 singles. 

Siddiqui highlighted the match 
with a win, holding off a close 
comeback in the second set. defeat-
ing her opponent, 6-4, 7-6. 

"Tara [Siddiqui) was injured for 

the mQSt part of the year, but she's 
making it back to the top of her 
game," head coach Liz LaPlante 
said. "She really peaked at the tour-
nament and had great games 
against both Delta State and West 
Florida." 

McKee was also able to pull out 
a win for the Tritons, winning her 
match in a decisive third-set 
tiebreaker. McKee lost the first set. 
6-4, but won the second, 7-5, and 
then beat her opponent, 10-6. 

On April 3, the Tritons beat 
13th-ranked Delta State for their 
only win of the tournament. Senior 
Julie Westerman had perhaps her 
best showing of the season, beating 
her opponent in a quick 6-1, 6-0 
match at No. I singles. Westerman 
teamed up with junior Jasmin Dao 
to defeat their opponents. 8-5. at 
No.1 doubles. Roberts and McKee 
defeated their opponents in rela-
tively easy straight sets to seal the 
victory for the Tritons. 

The tournament brings the 
Tritons' overall season record to 
13-8. The Tritons have only two 
more matches - against Cal State 
San Bernardino and Point Lorna 
Nazarene - before they begin 
regional qualifier matches for 
NCAA Division II Nationals.

tuning everyone's game right now."

laPlante said. "The Florida tour-
nament showed us what we needed 
to work on to compete against 
tougher teams." 

After UCSD's loss against 
Hawaii-Hilo on March 31, the 
Tritons are third in their confer-
ence and will have to play the sixth-
ranked team in their region, either 
Grand Canyon or Cal State Los 
Angeles. in the first round of con-
ference play beginning April 16. 
The winner of that match will then 
face Hawaii-HiIo to see who will 
move on to Nationals.

coupled with good efforts in prac-
tice, we will be 6ne." 

UCSD recovered from its losses 
by blanking California Collegiate 
Athletic Association rival Cal Poly 
Pomona on the road, recording its 
13th win of the season. This was 
the second meeting between the 
two teams. UCSD also won the 
fint, 8-1, back on Feb. 10. 

The Tritons attacked the 
Broncos early, earning a 3 -0 lead 
after winning all doubles matches.

dle and brought Burton home. 

Just when the Tritons saw the 
game within reach in the bottom 
of the ninth inning, UC Davis 
came up big. driving in a run to 
win the game 4-3 . 

The Aggies scored four times in 
the seventh inning to win game 
four, sweeping the series 4-0 for a 
second year in a row over the 
Tritons. The win was the 16th con-
secutive CCAA victory for UC 
Davis. 

Even with the losses, the Triton 
baseball team remains optimistic 
about the rest of the season and 
making the playoffs. 

Also, UC Davis is ineligible 
for the 2004 playoffs because of 
their current transition to 
Division I. 

With three CCAA series left for 
the Tritons, the UCSD baseball 
team continues to be in competi-
tion for a playoff berth.

four-game series &om April 16 
through April 18 at San Francisco,

only four games in all three dou-
bles matches. 

The Tritons' performance in 
doubles carried over into singles, not 
giving the Broncos a chance to come 
back. Needing to win only two sin-
gles matches to seal the victory for 
UCSD, all Triton singles players put 
forth solid performances and com-
pleted the sweep .. Swan, jwtior Emil 
Novak, Wilson, sophomore Brent 
Molden, Nejad and freshman Seth 
Spector each recorded a singles vic-
tory for the day. 

The victory was key for UCSD 
becaU$e it vaulted the team to the 
top of the CCAA ranlcings with a 
3-0 conference record, followed by 

UC Davis, who is 2-0. UC Davis is 
ineligible for postseason play 
because it officially moved up to 
Division I, but is not yet in full 
Division I status. 

The Tritons have been playing 
without senior Sameer Chopra, 
who is on the injured list, for the 
past four matches. Chopra. who 
normally plays No. I doubles with 
Wilson and No. 1 singles, is 
expected to be back nen week, 
according to Steidlmayer. 

UCSD wiD rest for a week before 
returning to action across town 
against Point Lorna on April 14 at 
2:30 p.rn. This will be the first of its 
final four regular season matches.

that higher-seeded teams are clos-
er to shore," first-year head coach 
Mark Davis said. 

In the second-from-outside 
lane, UCSD's boat looked like a 
raror slicing through the flat waters 
of Mission Bay, as the eight rowers 
and junior coxswain Shannon 
Oliver leapt out strong with the 
leaders and vied for first against the 
nation's best competition, includ-
ing Minnesota. UC Irvine. and 
community college heavyweight 
Orange Coast College. 

"Lane five is pretty far from 
shore, so it had rougher water, but 
we raced our hardest," said Davis. 

In the closing strokes, the 
Tritons found themselves ahead 
and then behind in a neck-and-
neck sprint for third place with UC 
Irvine. In a near photo finish, 
UCSD mustered the energy neces-
sary to swipe the bronze from the 
Anteaters, defeating its rival in a 
time of 6:36.25, versus the 6:36.45 
posted by UC Irvine. Also in the 
race was crosstown rival San Diego 
State University. who finished last 
in the heat and sixth overall. OCC 
took the Men's Cal Cup Grand 
Ymal in a display of sheer power, 
IiII'ninJ the gold in 6:25.40, tniled 
by Minnesota for the silver. 

This season, Davis helped his 
team oudine a new strategy to win 

the crucial spring regattas rather 
than to put emphasis on dual meets 
or less-important races. The San 
Diego Crew Classic was the first in 
a series of regattas between early 
April and early May that will deter-
mine the Tritons' national ranking. 

The Tritons set the bar high for 
the 2004 Crew Classic, planning to 
walk away from the regatta with a 
gold, but instead took third - 10 
places above their 2003 finish . 

April 17 will be the next oppor-
tunity for the Triton varsity eight 
to assault their opponents, as 
UCSD will face off against SDSU 
and University of San Diego in the 
annual San Diego City 
Championships. As in the Crew 
Qassic. the Tritons are refusing to 
allow themselves any slack from 
the intense ambition of proving the 
viability of the UCSD program to 
the national crew community, and 
have been committed to earning 
the gold medal at the event. 

If the Crew Classic is any indi-
cation of how the Tritons will fare 
against the local opposition, then 
UCSD may be looking to 
improve on its third-place status, 
as the Tritons sunk each of the 
other teams handily at the April 3 
and April 4 event. 

The San Diego City 
Championships will take place on 
Mission Bay at 8 a.m. on April 17.

Men's track charges 
to eighth place finish 
Women earn 13th place 

of the 20-team field 

Hila Mcy1J/Wotdian file 
Irs I stretch: The Triton women's track and field team struggled in the 
California·Nevada State Championships, but the men broke several school records. 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Triton men's track and field 
team gave a strong performance at 
the California-Nevada State 
Championships, held April 3 and 
April 4. The men's team ranlced 
eighth out of the 23 total entered, 
which marked the highest finish a 
UCSD track team has ever had at 
the meet. Meanwhile, the women's 
track and field team finished 13th 
out of 20 teams. 

The UCSD men's eighth-place 
finish was possible because seven 
individuals scored in eight events 
and both relays. These efforts gave 
the Tritons the highest finish 
among non-Division I male com-
petitors. 

The Triton men accrued 43 
points, 84 behind first-place Cal 
State Northridge. UC Davis, who 
is transitioning from Division IT to 
Division I for the 2005 season, 
barely edged out UCSD, finishing 
in seventh place with 47 .5 points. 

"The meet went very well over-
all ," head coach Tony Salerno said. 
"The men's team had a particularly 
good meet." 

Most of the competition was 
Division I teams, so UCSD's 
results were an accomplishment. 
UCSD beat Division I teams UC 
Irvine, UC Riverside and UC 
Santa Barbara, while leaving all 
Division II competitors in the dust. 

A number of strong individual 
efforts made a big difference in 
accumulating points for the team. 

Senior Julian Nahan finished 
the 3,000-meter steeplechase in 9 
minutes, 16.57 seconds, earning 
him the second-place position and 
an NCAA Provisional Qualifier. 
He also caprured the second-best 
all-time place in the UCSD record 
books. 

The steeplechase event had 
many other solid performances 
that resulted in UCSD record-
breaking and NCAA-qualifying 
times. 

Sophomore Carl Lostrom took 

fourth in the steeplechase, finish-
ing in 9 :25.54, which was the 
fourth-best all-time performance 
forUCSD. 

Senior Eric Nilsen was the sev-
enth-fastest finisher in the steeple-
chase, timing in at 9:33.70, which 
qualified him for the 10th-best 
time at UCSD. The steeplechase 
was one of only two events where 
UCSD had multiple scorers. 

"Julian Nahan was definitely a 
standout for the men in the 
steeplechase, along with Neil Kalra 
in the 5,000," Salerno said. "We 
had three scorers in the men's 
steeplechase, which is exceptional." 

Kalra, a senior, gave a third-
place effort in the 5,OOO-meter 
race, crossing the finish line in 
14:44.77, which makes him an 
NCAA Provisional Qualifier. His 
time earned him the fifth-best a11-
time position for the event at 
UCSD. 

Sophomore Jon Patton was 
another standout in the meet. 
Although Patton took fourth place 
in the 400-meter hurdles, racing in 
53.33 seconds, his performance in 
the IIO-meter hurdles eclipsed his 
400-meter event. He finished fifth 
in the 11 O-meter hurdles, crossing 
the line in 14.68 seconds,-a perfor-
mance good enough not only to 
name Patton an NCAA Provisional 
Qualifier but also to become the 
second-fastest time in UCSD his-
tory. 

"Jon Patton had a great meet 
scoring in both the 110 hurdles, 
400 hurdles, 400 relay and 1,600 
relay," Salerno said. 

The men's 400-meter relay 
team finished sixth, in 42.65 sec-
onds, and the 1,600-meter team 
wound up in ninth place, racing in 
3:20.18, with Patton a member of 
both relays. 

Sophomore Matt Borzage 
made another record-breaking 
effort with his solid time of 48.64 
seconds in the 400-meter, earning 
sixth place at the meet and the

Tritons top CCAA rankings at 3--0 
Men's tennis smothers Cal Poly Pomona 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
Sports Editor 

After making an unprecedent-
ed jump into the top five of the 
Division II national rankings, the 
UCSD men's tennis team hit a bit 
of a skid. The team lost its third 
consecutive match on April 4 to 
Division I Fresno State, 6-1, but 
bounced back and swept Cal Poly 
Pomona on April 6, 9-0, in a cru-
cial Division II match. 

Fresno State defeated the 
Tritons, with the lone UCSD 
point from senior Jeff Wilson's 
win against Jakub Cech at No.3 
singles. Junior Bryan Swatt and 
senior Amir Nejad paired up to 
win at No. 1 doubles, but because 
Division I rules only allow for a 
point awarded in doubles to the 
team taking at least two of three 
matches, UCSD was not credited 
the doubles point. The Bulldogs 
proceeded to sweep singles, hand-
ing the Tritons their ninth loss of 
the season. 

UCSD is currently 3-4 in play 
against Division I schools. The final 
Division I match is against UC
