The Chancellor 
Governor Brown ' s proposed 1979-80 budget has , 

understandably, excited a considerable negative reaction 
in systemwide UC admi nistration. 

If the budget passes the legislature more or less intact, 
the University will be asked to remove a bout $20 mitlion 
from existing programs. In trying to cope with that cut, the 
University has handed down a directive to a ll UC 
chancellors a llowing each one to cut programs, 
departments, administrative units and colleges on each 
campus at their own discretion, without reference to the 
Regents. 

The Guardian Wl'd J , III " . 1'1/" 

Chancellors in the UC system have always had ;.It least a 
de facto right to make those c uts, but explicit pennission to 
make them has never before existed . Chancellor McElroy 
said in his press conference Monday that no major 
academic or administrative cuts will result [rom this year's 
budget problems, and we have seen no indicution thut 
proposed cuts within the system justify giving ch;.lncellors 
such draconian authority. South 'Nam 

• Trouble In 
Contact with other Universities has convinced us that 

Chancellor McElroy ha been more solicitou th;.ln most 
chancellors of student and fuculty advice (though with 
mixed results) . Especially with his widened authority, we 
hope Chancellor McElroy continues to consult the general 
campus population in deuling with a difficult budget that is, 
after all, designed to administer us. 

Massive Flooding, War Damage Culprits 

CSU Funding 
The AS voted la t week not to allocate $315 to the 

Communications Student Union, which intended to co-
sponsor, along with the Communications Program, a beer 
bash and faculty- tudent get together at Third College. 

We believe the AS made a mistake. 
Council members successfully argued that the bash 

would only erve a "limited audience," even thou,gh 
Christy Drale, CS chairwoman, repeatedly told the 
Council the gathering would be open to the public . 

Others in the Council argued that funding the bash would 
set a bad precedent, wishing uloud that the AS wouldn't 
become known as simply a sponsor of beer oriented events . 

We believe the point, though , is not that the AS does or 
does not sponsor alcohol oriented events, but that the CSU 
proposal provides a n opportunity for an informal meeting 
between faculty and students, and increases faculty-
student cooperation . All departments need more of th<.lt 
kind of cooperation, especially the Communications 
Program, so often under attack from University officials. 
The AS , whose main function is to help students , s hould 
promote such events , not deny them. 

The only other Council objection to the funding was that it 
violated Activity Fee bylLJws to use Activity Fee funds for 
alcohol , but the AS itself eems to have successfu lly 
circumvented those re trictions . and we believe the 
Council should help the CS do so , too . The A 'decision 
should be rec on idered.

Already stra ined to the limit 
by the military campaign in 
Cambodia , Vietnam is 
continuing to fight a rear-guard 
battle agai nst a n equally 
ancient enemy, starvation. 

The food shortages here in 
the former South Vietnam 
capita l are so severe that the 
government is now considering 
ending (ood rations to the 
unemployed in order to force 
them into the rural New 
Economic Zones. 

"The main thing we a re 
thinking about now is providing 
enough glucose to prevent 
sta rvation ," said an economic 
specialist during a cundid 
briefing. 

He added that the pre ent 
monthly ration o( 13 kilo oC 
Coodsturrs per person Cor 
Vietnam's urban population is 
" not enough ," The population 
oC Saigon, now renamed Ho Chi 
Minh City, is suffering the 
wo rst malnutrition in the 
country, he said . He blamed the 
situation on a general shortfall 
throughout the country, bad 
management and the inability 
to get local authorities in the 
South to carry out policie 
ai med at easing the city 's 
plight.

wiped out nearly 3 million ton 
of paddy , according to official 
figures . The overall food deficit 
for the country is put by Hanoi 
officials at over 3 million tons . 
Foreign assistance is not 
expected to make up most of 
that shortfall. 

The urban population has to 
bear the brunt of the food 
shorWge. Last September, the 
government had to cut the 
official ration from 15 kilos to 13 
kilos a month , acco rding to both 
official and unofficial sources. 
OC this total, government 
workers get only t hree 
kilograms in rice and ordinary 
citizens get only one kilogram 
in rice, say unofficial source . 
The remainder of the ration is 
in wheat flour and 'weet 
potatoes. 

Only two years ago , 
according to private citizens in 
Ho Chi Minh City, each person 
received nine kilograms of rice 
per month along with six 
kilograms of wheat flour . Those 
engaged in manual labor could 
obtain an additional nine 
kilograms of rice per month. 

The supply of other CoodstuHs 
providing protein - meat , fish . 
eggs and milk - is also "ve ry 
low," according to the Hanoi 
official. 

The ma lnutrition in Saigon is 
not blamed enti rely on the 
[loods. "We have shortcomings 
in management," said the 
economic s pecialist. " Ho Chi 
Mi nh City is such a big city that 
our distribution system is not 
a dequate. " 

Politic • .! l , administrative 
problems have a lso adver ely 
aflected the supply of food to 
the city . The black murkct in 
rice. primarily carried out by 
individuals bringing bags of 
ri ce into the city from the 
co unll'ys ide, was forbidd n 
Crom t975 to mid-1978, a th 
government tried to gain 

co ntrol over the politically 
sensitive rice market. 
- But in August 1978, so little 
rice was making its way into.Ho 
Chi Minh City through official 
ch,lO nels that the government 
decided to lift the rest ri ctions 
on the private trade in rice. 
Orders were passed to 
provincial and local authorities 
not to interfere with individua ls 
bringing rice into the city to 
sell , according to Hanoi 
ofricials. 

But a lthough the order has 
been carried out in some areas, 
it is being ignored in others. 
Checkpoints a re still being 
manned by militiamen on main 
highways, as [ could observe on 
three trips outside Ho Chi Minh 
City. Buses are still being 
stopped and supplies of ric.-e 
greater than required for a 
single family's needs for a week 
are being conCi cated. 

A NOlthern official explained 
this insubordination by local 
Southern authorities by citing 
their interest in keeping rice 
prices as low as possible in their 
own areas. The price of ri ce on 
the bluck market is said to be 
three times higher in Ho Chi 
Minh City than in towns on ly 100 
kilometers away. 

Despite the food shortage in 
Ho Chi Minh City, thel'e has 
been virtually no movement of 
population out of the city to the 
government-orgunized "New 
Economic Zones" Cor more 
tha n a yeur . There arc now 
between 300,000 and 400 ,000 
unemployed in th e ci t y , 
accord ing to official here, 
about 800,000 fewer tha n there 
were in May 1978. 

" We ' ve been trying to 
persuade them for three and u 
half years th ,lt thcy mus t make 
,I n hones t living ," said onc Ho 
Chi Minh City offici.d . " but It's 
not easy to fOl'ce them to go. 
They will go today but orne

"I look thc physical and 
failcd. This p,'csented me with 
a gloomy outloot I didn't 
smoke ... (but) I never 
exe rcised and I had a lot of 
tension ... 

The ,'esults of his physical 
examination "frightened" 
Doolittl- into joining an 
exercise program at UCSD. 
" We met every day behind the 
cience and Engineering 

Library and would walk in 
circle around the trees - tI:1is 
used to exhaust me.;' , 

Doolittle attributed "social 
pressure" as the stimulus 
which kept ' him runnjng . 
However, when the exercise 
group evaporated ' in the 
summer, helound it very easy 
to skip running .. 'I'm the sort of 
guy wh 0 needs a goal." 

This "goal " came when 
I)()olittle heard about Bay to 
Breakers, a 7.6 milf' running 
event held annually in San 
Francisco. " I had never ran 0 
mile in my life," said Doolittle. 
" It sounded like an interesting 
ro ce, so I trained for it." 
Doolittle participated in Bay to 
Breakers the following year, 
along with 12,000 others. " I did 
wonderful. " he added. 

Shortly after, Doolittiejoined 
the San Diego Track Club, and 
began tt'oining for the local 
marathons. "By this time, 
running was a big craze and I 
was getting better," hesaid. He 
'took part in the Heart of San 
Diego and Mission Bay 
Marathons, both in which he 
became eligible to run in the 
Boston Marathon. "At this 
time, I amseriouslyplanningto 
go," said Doolittle. 

People interested in running 
a marathon should train for at 
least three months, running a 
minimum of 50 miles a week. 
Doolittle sa id . 

"One thing should add, 
when you finish a mara thon. 
you're tired." 

According to Doolittle , 0 
person " can't just run for 20 
minutes: with the stretching 
and shower, you need two 
hours." In wi nter, Doolittle 
enjoys running Crom 11 : 30 am 
to 1: 30 pm. " You c entially 
lose weight by skipping lunch." 
he laughed. During daylight 
saving time, he run from 5 to 7 
in the evening. Doolittle ca lls 
the se periods , " time not 
wasted . " 

" ] run alone - I get my best 
thinking done without inter-
ruptiun," said Doolittle.

TritonCagers Lose at Forum 

By Eric Jaye 
Los Angeles- On the court 

where great games have been 
played and NBA champion-
ships won, the Tritons looked 
somewhat more amateurish 
than usual as they went down in 
defeat 92-78 at the hands of 
Southern California College ilt 
the Forum here last night. 

In the game which preceded a 
La kers-New Jersey Nets 
matchup, the Tri tons showed 
some enthusiasm bu t little 
grasp or the rundamentals of 
basketball as they turned over 
the ball 25 times, passed poorly 
and were weak on the boards. 

"In college basketball you 
just have to have the 
fundamentals down and we still 
have a lot more work to do," 
said Triton Coach Barry 
Cunningham . 

According to Cunningham . 
SCC " was just a tronger 
team" and after Calling behind 
in the first period the Tritons 
had a poor chance of ever 
catching up. He added that the 
Tritons would have had to play 
an unusually strong game to 
beat SCC. 

The Tritons held their own 
against SCC until mid-way into 
the first period when SCC broke 
an 18-18 tie and jumped to a 26-
18 lead. After that the Tritons 
never got close. 

points to tie his season high. 
Also, though out-clilssed. the 
Tritons came up with a few 
impressive plays and showed a 
little spirit while going down to 
defeat. 

Confused 
The officiating last night WilS 

confused at times. On one 
occ,lsion the officials lined up 
the Tritons to take a penalty 
shot. then. after listening to the 
arguments of the SCC coach. 
the of[icials pulled the Tritons 
back and made them tilke the 
ball out. 

Cunningham said he thought 
the officials were " protecting" 
the SCC center Randy Adams. 
who scored 22 points and paced 
the SCC victory . 

Can't win 
Waiting for his own game to 

start. Lilke,' Ron Carter had a 
few words to say about the 
Tritons us he looked on from the 
side lines. 

" They ' re beat on the boards 
and they hllve to be more 
cilreful ilbout their shot 
selection. They put up some bad 
ones. 

" You cil n' t win like th at. "

There is a certain feeling of 
guilt that starts to build up 
while one stands "bout 
" intellectualizing" about thi 
Viet Num experience. Two 
forms of relief ure apparent 
however. One is that the 
intellectuulizing began with the 
urtist himself <IS he aimed the 
camera and snapped the 
shutter. The other form is 
provided by Thompson in the 
color photographs he offers. 
Nature studies and ex -
periments with lights <lnd time 
exposure act as a meuns of 
keeping sane at the time they 
were tuken, The two provide a 
ense of emerging from stark 

I'eulity with the incentive to 
transform the experience into 
,!n expression or creativity.

McElrpy Discusses Budget Cuts 
(Continued from P Ie I) 
libraries, McEI '0 said that 
library hours are ikely to be 
cut in the wa!; of budget 
reductions , "Students are 
going to have to tearn to study 
in their dorms or at home, " he 
remarked, 

Teaching Assistants (T A ' ), 
too, will be reduced in number, 
As many as lOOTA's,especially 
from the writing programs, 
may be cut from the university, 
according to McElroy, 

McElroy di cussed areas 
that the univer ity" cou ld let go 
of that wouldn't hurt the next 
two or three year ," They 
in lude the maintenance of 
building , " Ietting the grounds 
d teriorate, " dclaying of 
purcha ing, a nd ridding of the 
auditing system. 

tudent fces , too , may 
increa e a ' a rc 'ult of budget 
cuts. "If wc get additiona l 
cuts, " McElroy s,lid, " we' ll 
have to increa ' C it (fc's) to 
cover the co t ."

Play 
( ontinued from pagt' 9) 
tates their downfall a well. The 
moral is to lie, but don ' t lie too 
much . Be-corduroyed and 
shaggy-haired, he eems out of 
place in the glittering fishbowl 
aristocracy as embled for the 
evening in Celimene's flat. 
Celimene, beautiful and 
unfaithful , the bane of Alce te's 
existence, is characterized 
very nicely b y Ro ina 
Widdowson-Reynolds. In fact, 
M , Widdowson-Reynolds is the 
plea ante t thing about the 
production - h' is lovely to 
look at, her low melodious voice 
is very agreeable and she i not 
dressed in blue !
