Keep Big M~c Out of Coffee Hut 
Editor: 

I am outraged by the 
Chancellor'S desire to turn the 
Coffee Hut into a faculty club, 
Revelle needs the additional 
capacity provided by the Coffee 
Hut during lunchtime, us the 
Deli would not be able to hilndle

would be the result of the Hut's 
closing. One need only shoot 1.I

that undergrilduiltes c.lt UCSD 
ure treilted with a bit more 
considerutiol1 than laboriltory 
anim .. lls. whieh I often doubt. So 
let there be a faeultv club if we 
need it so budly. B~t not at the 
expense of one of the most 
popular and beloved restc.lU-
rants on campus! This brings 
us to the Ch,lI1eellor-s assertion 
that due to eeonomic eonsidcr-
ations. the Hut would be closed 
nex t yea r if not converted to c.l 
club. I eu nnot believe. thut the 
restaurant is truly operating in 
the red . It is just too popular u 
hungout. Therefore. I ean only 
regard the Chilncellor's 
"ssel'tion as a thinly veiled 
threat. 

also the I'CIllOl'aI of vending bewildering how these 
Illuchine revenues fmm the seund;.rlous proposals have a

mushrooms "fter " rain.

Before going on , I'd like to 
consider individuully the 
reasons for the Chancellor's 
proposal. Most obviously he 
must feel that UCSD needs a 
faculty club. This is legitimiJte, 
perhaps. since most colleges 
und univer ities huve them. 
But it should not be in the Coffee 
Hut. Many students who have 
clusses or jobs during normul 
dinner houl's rely on the Coffee 
Hut ilS the only plaee to eat at an 
appropriute hour whieh

NEWS BRIEFS 
From the Associated Press 

Workers Take Over Iranian Oil 
ABADAN. Iran (AP) - Iran 's oil industry, once the world's No . 

2 supplier, is in the hands of radical workers who demand a major 
role in deciding who gets their product and at what price. 

Marxists are actively recruiting among them, although they 
remain a minority. 

Labor leaders who organized the general strike that halted oil 
exports and brought the Iranian economy to its knees say they are 
willing to allow oil to be sold to anyone except Israel and South 
Africa once they receive orders from the provisional government 
of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. 

Deputy Prime Minister Amir Entezam said the new government 
hopes to resume selling oil abroad in .about two weeks. 

But in interviews with The Associated Pre s, workers made 
clear they expect the government to heed their demands - among 
lhem redistribution of income, an end to foreign control of the 
industry and the right to reject management appointees. 

They also expect Iran to press for a ubstantial boost in oil prices 
above the level set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Cou ntries. If their demands are ignored, they said, many are 
prepared to resume the strike and shut off the flow of oil. 

INTERNATIONAL 

Although most workers claim to be devout Moslem followers of 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and disavow atheistic communism, 
they espouse social and political view very clo e to Marxism. 

" We do not think we have completely achieved the objectives of 
the revolution," aid Habib Khabiri , a member of Abadan's oil 
worker committee. " Only the elementary stages have been 
completed_ For example, the government is a transitional one and 
has not yet announced its policies regarding redistribution of 
incomes and labor laws. If the former class order is to remain in 
this country , c1ashe will be more widespread and bloodier .. ' 

ominally the government-owned National Iranian Oil Co. 
controls the industry . but the real masters of the fields a nd 
refineries of Khuzesta n province are members of revolutionary 
worker committees established by Khomeini. 

Managers left over from the previous regime are careful to 
avoid any decisions that might conflict with the wishes of the local 
committees, who also have power of arrest. Hassa n Nazih , a 
human-rights activist and attorney, has been named by Bazargan 
to head NIOC, but he has not yet begun wholesale replacement of 
key supervisors.

BANGKOK, Thailand (AP ) - Well-informed Chi nese sources in

It quoted the sources as saying China' s ,. punitive action" will

Kyodo a lso reported thal peking R adio said Chinese troops had 
engaged Vietnamese army regular in hand-to-hand fighting near 
Dong Dang. a village three mil~ inside Vietnam. Most reports

NATIONAL 
US Might Intervene 

WASHINGTON (AP) - Two administration officials said 
yesterday the United States is prepared to use military force if 
necessary to protect oil sources and vital interests in the Mideast. 

" Protection of the oil flow from the Mideast is clearly partof OUI' 
vilal interests ," said Defense Secretary Harold Brown. '· .. .In -
protection of these vital interests, we'll take any action that's 
appropriate, including the use of military force ." 

Energy Secretary James Schlesinger, speaking of U .S_ interests 
in the Persian Gulf, said : " The issue of a U.S. military presence is 
under con ideration , That wo'uld involve militury personnel. 
Whether it would involve a deployment of troop ... combat arms of 
the ground forces. is another question ."

Brink's Crooks Steal Hearts of Audience 
By Beth Accomando 

&&aff Writer 
Historic Million Dollar Heist , 'Perfect': 

Because of the laws and 
restrictions of society, 
American audiences often find 
the lawlessness of the criminal 
appealing and fascinating, 
Audiences are always ready to 
accept a new folk hero from the 
criminal line-up, and in the 
light-hearted caper film The 
Brink's Job they find one, 
Director William Friedkin~as 
chosen an especially aUractrve 
band of crooks and an amazing 
crime with which to captivate 
modern audiences, 

Falk Leads Softened Version of Real Gang 
and no on~ was hurt. The As Pi no, Falk heads a bandof 
robbery was committed by-an inept thieves who look 
unlikely crew of small tjme incapable of stealing candy 
crooks who had spent more from a baby. Falk, with his of(-
time in jail than out. The leader beat charm, delivers one of his 
was Tony Pino (Peter Falk) , a best performances as a man 
compulsive crook who stole with big dreams who is barned, 
anything from underwear to first by the ease of his crime 
refrigerators. Pino discovered and then by the sudden 
the Brink's vault and noticed adoration that the public 
that it cheap security system heaves on him. Warren Oates 

Friedkin 's Brink's robbers 
are a oftened version of the 
real men who tole over $] 

-million from the prestigious 
Brink's company, but his 
depiction _ of their crime i 
extremely accurate. The 
Brink's robbery is a perfect 
crime for capturing the 
imagination of the public: it 
was on a huge cale, its victim 
was an impersonal company, 

made it an easy target. In ]950, 
after about a year of planning, 
Pino and his cohorts finally 
pulled off (in a mere 20 
minutes) the job that would 
make crim inal history. The 
FBI, eager for the publicity, 
tarted a man hunt that would 

la t 6 years, cost $25 million, 
but that never recovered the 
money . The FBI, however. did 
secure the robber' arrests 5 
days before the statute of 
limitatinns ran out.

on his fellow criminals. Gena 
Rowlands. a rare scree n 
pleasure, has only a Inken role 
as Pino's wife but she gives a 
warm, credible performance. 

Overall , Friedkin handles the 
film well and refrains from 
including any strictly ex-

pository scenes about the 
robbery plan. His scenes are 
crisp and smooth but they 
remain a bit cool : the audience 
never really gets caught up in 
the suspense or in the li ves of 
the crooks.

Ryder Still Capable: Wants Comeback •

hysterical female fans . his 
billowy satin shirt stained with 
perspiration. Eventually, 
though, the hits stopped (;oming 

endless replaying of a LeFreak

and his new buckup greup. 
Resolutely I fought a creeping

The n.an is somewhat 

puunchy now. no longer the

Ryder ' s lungpower and

to regain his place in the rock 
stur world badly, which 
heightened the drama of his 
performance all the more. 

A shopping center cocktail 
lounge on the fringes of a San

unlikely spot to showcase a 
former rock star looking for a 
comeback. Certainly it isn't the 
kind of place I normally hang 
out in - yet there I was last 
Thursday, silting stage-side at 
the Bacchanal on Clairemont 
Mesa Blvd: awaiting Mitch 
Ryder's first local concert 
appearance since 1966. Such 
are the urious ways of show biz 
and rock journalism, 

"The man is somewhat paunchy now, no longer the teen 
idol in fancy c.1othes but Ryder's lungpower and 
delivery remain strong ... " 

The songs Ryder and his band 
offered were an enjoyable mix 
of old favorites and new 
material. Ryder belted out a 
blood-curdling " Take Me To 
The River," a soulful rendition 
of Lou Re d's " Rock and Roll" 
and franlil:<llly funked-up 
versions of Bob Dylan 's " The 
Wicked Messe nger " an d 
. 'Subterranean Homesick 
Blue ." From hi new How I 
SPCIl' My Vacation ulbum 
Ryder sa ng " ice 'n ' Easy, " 
" Cherry Poppin ' " and other 
plea ingly raunchy tune . The 
band supporting Ryder was , in 
a word , excellent, able to be 
d 'Iiea te 01' earsplitting as the 
mood required. 

Ryder, I felt, was worth going 
out of my way to see. Over a 
decade ago this Detroit blues-
rock singer (aka Billy Levise) 
had a string of hit Singles, most 
notably the screifming bodgie 
medley " Devil With A Blue 
Dress On/Good Golly Miss 
Molly ." Ryder in his early 20s 

and Ryder slipped ' into 
ob cudty, moving to Colol'ado, 
working in a Detroit warehou 'e 
for a time. 

Could Ryder 10 years later 
hope to equal the anguished 
abandon of his past per -
formances? I was curious , and 
so endured an irritating 
opening band, a seemingly 

make the Bacchanal Kearny 
Mesa 's Number One nightspol 
east of Convoy stl'eel. Then a 
rath er nonde cript-Iooking 
mun appeared on stage ,with a 
few musicians. Moments later 
the lounge was ringing with the 
sublime din of good hard blues-
rock und the enraptured 
screami ng of Mitch Ryder

By William Gi bson 
Last Saturday night was a 

bad one for me. Not that this is 
unusual for a student of the 
Arts. My m ind was, as usual, 
brewing Its dark formulas, 
sti rred by the dregs of past 
existences ; the past, when 
there was good and evil rather 
than psychology and lifestyles, 
you know? Well then, to lighten 
the tone of my foul thoughts I 
turned to that infamous 
divertis ement, the television, 
to ease my mind with its 
empathic electric emanations. 

What did I find, on Channel 
i5? The Prisoner, a B.B.C. 
show of the sixties starring 
Patrick McGoohan as a 
resigned Secret Servi e agent, 
condemned to live in a plac(! 
where the prisoners can't be 
di cerned from the warders: 
just the thing. The Evil Warden 
was playing environment 
games with McGoohan, who 
teadfastly refused to admit 

why he had resigned . 
ReSigned? Does one resign 
from such imbroglios ? 
Anyway, the show is good, 
perhaps especially for 
paranoid, tray -s pinning 
Revelle Chern major : it airs 

I 
each Saturday evening at 7: 00 ' 
p.m., on Channel 15. 

Next, I diverted myself by 
thinking about Public Opinion, 
that ostensibly all-powerful 
political force - look' at Iran. 
There , the People have risen 
and ousted a heinous fiend , a 
puppet of the imperialist West 
etc. ad infinitum. This set me 
thinking about Day ca re , 
UCSD's own burning issue. 
This proved depres ing , 
however. as I realized that this 
issue is not aquestionexcept for 
the more messianic Left-
Wingers, of whether our poor 
children will be clothed and 
cared-for while their parents 
pursue their studies , but 
whether lhey will have salar ied 
teachers: a n economic 
question, in which ocial ethics 
is doomed to play. a small role. 

The only thing for it, [ next 
decided, was the End Of The 
World . So I ran blithely off to 
The Late Great Planet Ear th at 
the Clairemont Cinemu. Hal 
Lindsey reully did it up this 
time: here may be seen Jesus, 
Saint John experiencing the 
Hevelation, the Reverend Moon 
sercuming in Korean in the 
AstI'odome and much more in 

the .space of two hours. How 
real is real, indeed. The movie 
is a horrendously propa-
gandistic compilation of the 
evidence that the End Times 
have arrived, something people 
(including Jesus . if the Gospel 
is to be believed) have been 
saying for centuries. 

It turns out that the Hebrew 
character which we translate 
666 merely imply that man (6) 
shall turn himself into his God 
(666), or so suys Lindsey. Now, 
when one sees Comrnunic<ltions 
majors scuttling out of the 
bookstore, gleefully clutching 
copies of Schiller'S 'The Mind 
Manager ano "ow Real is 
Real. these lUke on an insidious 
tinge to one sensitive and silly 
enough to study the Arts. 

The only total boo-boo I 
caught Lindsey making is 
d 1"<1 win g the n a i ve .1 n d 
groundless distinction between 
",III the events of history" .lOd 
the " will of God." Why the hell. 
especially in the Christian 
view. shuuldn't the aelions of 
men in history bt- the wi II tif 
God'~ Oh well. I guess it's 
difficult 10 be sm:lrt and a 
I'eligiuus fanatic these days.

Greg Griffen, the AS

" What wc wcrc looking for 
was some idca of whethcr they

Nicoll isn ' t surc of just how 

v<.Ilu<.lble thc rcfcrendum is at 
all. "I don't thi n k any 
rcfercndum (at l CSDI 
succecds in judging student

He <.Icknowledges, though, 
th<.lt the referendum is 
important in other ways. "1 was 
re<.llly surprised at the largc 
turnout.. .il's a forcc thc Reg 
Fee Committee will have to 
contend with." 

Martha Mangold , Third 
College representative to the
