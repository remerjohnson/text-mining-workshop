SPIRIT NIGHT DE-SPIRITED

Administrators overseeing the Spirit Night 2014 plans made sweeping changes to the way UCSD’s residential colleges were judged for their participa-
tion, with particular emphasis on decorating standards. 

After each annual Spirit Night, representatives from A.S. 
Council, the six residential colleges and the UCSD admin-
istration usually review the event proceedings and discuss 
possible areas of improvement for the next year. They then 
meet several times during fall quarter to coordinate and 
implement these changes.

This year, the college deans intervened in the process, 
deciding to cut down the Spirit Cup criteria and proce-

dures, ostensibly to cut down student organizer workloads. 
Furthermore, they wished to promote year-round school 
spirit instead of focusing too much on a single event.

Matthew Sapien, A.S. Council’s AVP of Athletic 
Relations, has been attending the meetings for four years 
and plays a large role in organizing the preparations.

“We knew that there were going to be changes,” Sapien 
said. “In the past couple of years, administrators brought up 
that [decorating] is a stressful job on students, so last year, 
we had representatives from each of the colleges who felt 
strongly about it come to the meeting to try to eliminate 
some of the stress factors that were making it too tough 

A former UC Santa Barbara stu-
dent is suing the UC Board of Regents 
over allegations of sexual abuse by a 
TA. She is also suing her purported 
abuser, Jeffrey Beckstrand, a graduate 
student in UCSB’s English department.

The student, known only as Jane 
Doe for the duration of the lawsuit, 
attended UCSB from 2008 to 2012. 
She is seeking punitive damages for 
sexual assault and battery, as well as 
emotional distress and negligence and 
holding the UC Regents responsible 
for premises liability.

Doe claims Beckstrand was a TA 
for one of her classes and that she 
had asked him for help on a paper on 
Valentine’s Day 2012. 

The lawsuit states that Doe met 
Beckstrand in his campus office at 9 
p.m., at which point he began asking 

her personal questions and touching 
her breast without her consent. 

“Beckstrand blocked her attempts 
[to leave],” according to the lawsuit. 
“He stated ‘You won’t leave unless I ask 
you to leave.’” 

Doe further claims that Beckstrand 
told her he had a knife.

“Beckstrand then forced plaintiff 
onto her knees. Plaintiff struggled to 
escape but Beckstrand overpowered 
her,” the lawsuit continues. “Beckstrand 
then forcibly opened plaintiff ’s mouth 
and forced her to orally copulate him. 
Beckstrand also struck plaintiff in her 
face several times with his hand.”

Doe is being represented by Jeffrey 
Coleman of Tustin. 

Representatives from the University 
of California could not be reached for 
comment. 

UCSB Student Sues UC 
Regents After Sexual Abuse

UC  SYSTEM

Representatives from the UCSD 
Child Care Oversight Committee in 
conjunction with the UCSD Grad 
Parents Network and Undergraduate 
Student Parents Network met with 
Campus Climate councilmem-
bers last week to discuss concerns 
regarding student-parent support 
and the lack of readily available, on-
campus childcare resources.

The research team included 
Graduate Student Association Vice 
President of Diversity Don Johnson, 
CCOC member Brandon Stephens 
and Student Parent Wellness intern 

Rochelle Lorkovic. The team pre-
sented findings from a 2013 
Childcare Survey demonstrating 
that student parents are unsatis-
fied with affordability and access to 
childcare support on campus.

 A 2009 graduate parent-only 
survey inspired the CCOC sur-
vey, asking parents why a major-
ity of them were not using campus 
resources and subsequently asking 
about the alternative solutions that 
they were turning to instead.

Lorkovic used a contracted uni-
versity company to release the sur-
vey in the Mesa and One Miramar 
Street housing communities as well

FLEETING THOUGHTS By Irene Chiang

#OMG! Follow us on Twitter #NOW! 

of a job.”
According to Sapien, colleges used 

to be judged on six main criteria in past 
Spirit Nights. However, many of them 
were reformatted this year. Firstly, while 
college campus decorating was weighed 
as heavily as ever, students were no longer 
required to decorate the residence halls or 
dining halls. Decorations in the RIMAC 
arena were also severely reduced, primar-
ily due to concerns over eco-friendliness. 
Colleges were instead allowed to display 
their own customized banner. Finally, 
attendance at Triton Jam, spirit rallies 
and sports games leading up to Spirit 
Night were no longer taken into account. 
Spirit Night attendance, college cheers 
and the halftime competition remained 
unchanged. 

Although Sapien understands the 
rationale behind the administration’s deci-
sions, he is unhappy with the sudden man-
ner by which they were introduced and 
disagrees with the scale of the perceived 
stress problem.

“It was presented so quickly, we couldn’t 

have much of an input,” he said. “We didn’t 
realize how drastic the changes would be. 
We put so many resources into advertis-
ing select things that weren’t actually that 
highlighted anymore. It was frustrating on 
my end and pretty ironic that the deans 
wanted to minimize stress for us.”  

Warren College sophomore Akshay 
Tangutur is the Commissioner of Warren 
Spirit and coordinated participation in 
Spirit Night in conjunction with other 
Warren organizations.

“For me, the workload was much dif-
ferent [...] and it didn’t really alleviate 
much [stress], as I had to change all my 
thoughts and ideas to what had now been 
proposed,” Tangutur said in an online 
statement. “I believe that they can keep it 
the same next year, but the one thing that 
I would really like to change is the fact 
that we don’t get to decorate the gym [...] 
Other than that, I guess I can live with 
the changes.”

The Council of Deans was unavailable 
for comment.

get involved.

STUDENT EVENTS

Weekly events and opportunities just for students.

as through the Grad Parents and 
Undergraduate Student Parents list-
servs.

The survey was released for three 
weeks, garnering replies from 140 
graduate and undergraduate student 
parents.

“This survey [was] very impor-
tant because it provides information 
about the needs of student par-
ents, the effectiveness of current 
resources and especially because it 
provides the data necessary to pro-
pose changes,” Lorkovic said.

According to the climate council 
presentation, UCSD currently pro-
vides two campus childcare facilities 
— the Early Childhood Education 
Center and Mesa Childhood 
Development Center — although 
only about 13 percent of graduate 
student parents utilize the centers.

“Compared to childcare cen-
ters across other UCs, childcare at 
UCSD falls slightly above the aver-
age range by about $300 per month,” 
the presentation said. “Students, 
faculty and staff have the perception 
that both ECEC and MCDC are not 
an accessible resource due to both 
the high cost and long wait list.”

Although subsidized for applica-
ble student parents, ECEC month-
ly costs for child care range from 
$1643 to $124, while MCDC costs 

range between $1512 and $756 per 
month.

According to the survey, approx-
imately 50 percent of university 
graduate families earn less than 
$45,000 annually, with graduate 
parents in all income brackets rec-
ognizing that the current monthly 
costs of the two centers prohibit 
many student parents from utilizing 
the spaces.

To combat the issue, Lorkovic, 
Johnson and Stephens analyzed the 
survey results and developed rec-
ommendations to alleviate child-
care concerns that were presented to 
administration.

“We don’t want to look at [child-
care] as a student problem,” Stephens 
said. “It’s a campus problem.”

The proposed actions include 
the creation of a low-cost university 
childcare co-op and the introduc-
tion of an application-based slid-
ing scale reimbursement plan that 
would finance childcare support for 
low-income families not qualifying 
for subsidized childcare aid.

 The team hopes to meet the con-
cerns of the undergraduate student 
parent population as well, marking 
the first of such an initiative.

“We were focusing more on 
graduate students because of where 
we’re coming from, but it’s clear that 
undergrads also need support, and 

I really do think it’s important to 
emphasize the resolutions that we 
are going for,” Stephens said.

Last quarter, the GSA passed a 
council resolution in favor of rein-
vesting in graduate parents, call-
ing for action to support student 
parents unable to pay for campus 
care and advocating for a graduate 
student fee referendum to subsidize 
childcare.

The resolution also supported 
the creation of a childcare website 
to provide ready access to childcare 
resources in and around UCSD, an 
initiative that was also discussed at 
last week’s campus climate meeting.

Lorkovic, Johnson and Stephens 
expect to introduce a similar reso-
lution to A.S. Council in the near 
future, hoping to gain undergradu-
ate student support.

The team now hopes to gain more 
administrative support in imple-
menting its recommendations, with 
plans to pass a formal, detailed reso-
lution through Academic Senate. 

“Brandon, Rochelle and I have 
essentially started precursor steps 
toward a movement, and to further 
it, there needs to be a larger critical 
mass of people that hold adminis-
tration accountable,” Johnson said.

An intern for La Jolla Playhouse, 
Helen Ly, kicked off last night’s council 
meeting with a story: “When I was an 
underclassman I would ask my friends 
if they would want to go to a play, and 
they’d be like, ‘No, I want to go study.’” 

Wait, isn’t that just every UCSD 
student ever? Kidding, kidding. Sort of.

Kyle Heiskala is “five for five,” 
coming out to 
this week’s council 
meeting to encour-
age students to vote 
for the mayor and 
sign pledge cards 
to vote for SOVAC. They need 2,900 
pledges by Tuesday to get a grant from 
Engage San Diego; if you plan on vot-
ing, go help them out! If you don’t plan 
on voting, you should vote.

UCSD undergraduate SHIP rep-
resentative Stephanie Bailey then pre-
sented to explain how UC Office of the 
President plans on handling the $61 
million deficit incurred by negligence.

“It’s like spending money and never 
checking your account,” Bailey said. 

Really, UCOP? I don’t even do that, 
and I literally (almost … sadly) don’t 
have money to spend.

VP External Vanessa Garcia then 
explained UC Student Association’s 
initiative, Fund UC, that encourages 
Prop 13 — a property tax initiative that 
would force corporations to pay their 
fair share since, according to Garcia, 
they currently pay tax rates from 1970. 
Another initiative UCSA is advocating 
is that, should a California cannabis 
and hemp initiative make its way onto 
this year’s ballot, the funds should go 
toward higher education. 

Muir College Senator Hope Czbas, 
who I have never seen at council before, 
was kind and cheery, wishing everyone 
luck on their midterms and asking 
them to take pictures with a teddy bear 
for her. It seems council hasn’t broken 
her spirit, and maybe if she continues 

not showing up it never will.
Then things got serious, when ERC 

Senator Chris Klein announced that 
SCERC failed all parts of the new con-
stitution, and thus that there will, at this 
point, be no changes to council struc-
ture. Additionally, the meeting during 
which SCERC voted was an executive 
session closed to the public, render-

ing the informa-
tion confidential. 
Basically, no one 
knows why they 
didn’t pass the con-
stitution, or why 

they decided council bylaws warrant  
an executive session.

Garcia summed it up perfectly: “It’s 
really disheartening to see that every-
thing just kind of fell through. I saw so 
many members of council work tire-
lessly on this to really no avail.”

SCERC President Ali Younes 
responded, “On a lighter note, I don’t 
have a social life after 5 p.m., so you 
are all open to talk to me.” He then rec-
ommended that council watch a two-
and-a-half-hour debate on creationism 
versus evolution in their spare time.

A final resolution by the Union of 
Jewish Students about the shortened 
winter break for next year — sup-
posedly made to help observant stu-
dents avoid a holiday conflict — was 
passed unanimously by council. UJS 
Vice President of Religion Zev Hurwitz 
announced an OVAL approval rating 
from students of over 87 percent.

“Our community was one of the 
first that got a finger pointed at us 
— the middle finger,” Hurwitz said. 
“These changes actually make things 
harder for us, we never asked for this, 
and had anybody approached us about 
this, we would have said, ‘No, this is 
stupid.’”

Oh, UC admin. Between SHIP and 
the calendar change, tonight was not 
your night. Maybe next week.

UCSD students don’t usually get riled up about much, but when we returned to 
school in the fall to find Graffiti 
Hall covered with monochrome 
grey paint instead of the usual 
explosion of colors, the student 
body made it clear they were livid. 

Graffiti Hall was possibly the 
only place for pure expression on 
our stoic campus (not to mention 
a great venue for hooking up) and 
with its disappearance, we need to 
find a way to get a new one. A.S. 
Council’s referendum on the mat-
ter, which has been pushed back to 
the spring quarter general election, 
would merely show the adminis-
tration that we do want our space 
back, but makes no actual binding 
promise for change. Under these 
conditions, students will need to be 
proactive if they want to see a free 
expression space return to campus.

At UCSD, Graffiti Hall was 
one of the only icons of subversive 
counterculture, and its original 
location was ideal — an out-of-the-
way nook discreetly tucked into 
Mandeville Center. The series of 

stairwells is seemingly useless for 
any other purpose besides storage, 
but for years, students used them 
to express themselves and connect 
with a community. Graffiti Hall 
quickly became an important sym-
bol of creativity on our campus.

The old location added an 
added wonderment to the first time 
a new student stumbled upon the 
labyrinthine maze halls. We cur-
rently seem to have no such luck 
with the possible replacements. 
Potential locations for the new 
space include the “hump,” an out-
door grassy area located behind the 
Old Student Center, or the nearby 
grove of eucalyptus trees.

Though these replacements 
sound less than stellar, the old 
space was riddled with safety 
concerns that make reinstating it 
unfeasible. Administrators were 
justifiably concerned that the pre-
vious confined space was full of 
dangerous paint fumes and other 
toxins. Combined with the lack of 
any kind of surveillance, Graffiti 
Hall had been sketchy at night and 
a tough sell for any administrator 

to support.
Last Thursday, Assistant Vice 

Chancellor of Student Life Gary 
Ratcliff told the UCSD Guardian 
that as a program not administered 
by the university, Graffiti Hall had 
a “certain appeal that you can’t rep-
licate in a program that is officially 
run by the A.S. [Council] or the 
Student Center.”

Ratcliff is right that the former 
Graffiti Hall had a certain rebel-chic 
charm. But it would be irresponsible 
to create a new free expression area 
that jeopardizes safety of visitors or 
imposes an arguably hostile environ-
ment for other groups within the 
campus community. 

If students pass the non-binding 
referendum next month (as they 
should), student leaders and torch-
bearers for the original hall should 
help create the new space that 
doesn’t endanger passers-byers and 
the administration should, as they 
did in the past, turn a blind eye 
to allow free expression. After all, 
UCSD should jump at any oppor-
tunity for a little more artistic vibe 
on campus.

You Will 
Meet a 
Tall, Dark 
Reality

When Woody Allen’s sexual abuse allegations resur-faced last week and loyal 
fans slipped into a state of shock, I was 
reminded of an affliction called the 
Paris Syndrome.

The name conjures up images of 
wannabe-hipsters drawing curlicue 
mustaches on their fingers and “That 
’70s Show’s” Eric Forman falling prey 
to his anticipated college “beret-
wearing phase,” but the disorder is 
more serious than it sounds. Every 
year, around a couple dozen tour-
ists visiting Paris for the first time 
suffer psychiatric breakdowns when 
reality does not meet their deeply 
romanticized expectations of the 
City of Light. Paris — most notably 
in Japanese media — is portrayed as 
an idyllic city in which dainty fash-
ion models skip down the winding, 
cobbled streets of the film “Amelie,” 
and attractive couples nibble on 
macaroons at quaint cafes along the 
Champs-Elysees.

Allen, with his trademark ’60s 
thick, black-rimmed glasses, tweed 
jacket and perpetually quizzical 
expression, outwardly appears as 
respectable as his five-decades-long 
Hollywood career. On Feb. 1, Allen’s 
adopted daughter Dylan Farrow 
defaced this image when she wrote in 
an open letter to The New York Times 
that the auteur had molested her 
when she was 7 years old — reopen-
ing the 1992 accusations that were 
before the times of many of us.

The media tends to reaffirm 
the positive image of high-profile 
American icons by making agreeable 
aspects more salient, while down-
playing minor unfavorable instances. 
Farrow’s charges are by no means 
small enough to ignore. When 
people experience a discord between 
expectations and reality, many 
instinctually leap to reconcile these 
differences in favor of their long-
standing perceptions. As expected, 
many have rushed to Allen’s defense 
without first evaluating the facts or 
likely even reading the entirety of 
Farrow’s public admission.

This is the wrong way to 
approach an unpleasant revela-
tion. It is understandable that, for 
the fiercely devoted Woody buffs 
who can rattle off lines from 
“Manhattan” and “Annie Hall” by 
heart, even thinking about the 
possible truth of these accusations 
riddles them with anxiety. However, 
fans must understand that without 
his four Academy Awards and 24 
nominations, Allen is as human as 
any other person. Celebrities, too, 
stand in line at grocery stores, get 
stuck in traffic and, unfortunately, 
also engage in illicit activities. 
The ugly truths behind charming 
onscreen personas might not be as 
evident as with the ever-morphing 
Michael Jackson, but they do exist, 
and fame doesn’t erase them. 

Allen’s 2011 film “Midnight in 
Paris,” with its museum-like scenery 
and hackneyed romance-in-Paris 
theme, certainly did not help tour-
ists banish their dreams of Parisian 
waiters bursting into song and dance. 
Allen fans should realize that by 
blindly defending an act they have 
never witnessed, they are likely only 
clutching onto an idealized worldview 
in which artistic genius and corrup-
tion are mutually exclusive.

End the Bus Fuss
The transportation referendum will hit this spring’s general election ballot, 

but students will need to vote to end our ongoing transportation crisis. 
ILLUSTRATION BY JEFFREY LAU

A.S. Council announced this week that they plan to move their transportation referendum to the general elec-tion rather than holding a special election, an idea we’ve floated during our editorial board meetings for the past few weeks. It’s basically like they read our minds.
Whether Council came to this conclusion on its own, or if the admin twisted its arms into changing the 

referendum, it’s a major win for everyone. Moving the resolution to the general election means it’s likely that more 
students will participate, and more opinions will be heard. Even the 20 percent student turnout we normally get for 
Council elections is probably more than we would have seen in a special election.

The transportation referendum as it stands is unfortunately vague in regards to where the funds will be going. We 
do applaud Council for taking a few extra weeks to modify the language in a move that will hopefully clarify what 
our money is being spent on. It’s perhaps most prudent to make the referendum about immediate solutions to our 
buses and shuttles. The much lauded bike paths seem like a major construction project that will take years to fully 
execute and to tie them to the shuttles just seems like a good way to slow down the entire process.

And we certainly don’t need to spend our money on any more videos.
There’s really no way around the fact that any transportation solution has to include price hikes. Transportation 

and Parking Services is broke in a big way, and they need the cash to continue operating the shuttles at all, not to 
mention to handle all the upgrades and repairs to the shuttles. However, it is important for students that the price 
increase is reasonable and that we get our money’s worth. A good way to do that is to give us a transit pass that 
includes the MTS buses and the trolley. With trolley stops coming to Sixth College in a matter of years, it might be a

SOLVE FOR X By Philip Jia LETTER  TO  THE  EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Staff writer Charu Mehra’s 

rebuttal of “a radical proposal” 
to lower public university tuition 
costs, showing a cartoon of the 
at-risk Stanford University [once 
viable, now boarded up], was hilari-
ous. Gifts to that Palo Alto private 
university in a recent Fiscal Year 
topped the scale at $1.035 billion; 
even UC San Diego racked up $135 
million in that one fiscal year alone.

Stanford University surpassed its 
previous record of $911 million.

The $1.035 billion is equal 
to nearly $56,000 for each of its 
roughly 18,500 students, though 
typically endowment money is 
used for research and construction. 
Although NYCC had free tuition in 
the 1930s — as did UC San Diego 
in the 1960s — today’s trend is for 
higher public university tuition 
costs.  An L.A. Times’ article pub-
lished the same date as the Mehra 
article, “Long Beach City College 
experiments with tiered pricing,” 
reports “high-demand courses are 
offered at a higher price.”

A monthlong winter extension 
course at LBCC under the program 
could cost up to $225 per unit, 
nearly five times the normal price. 

Educators and experts say col-
leges nationwide may be watching 
the Long Beach experiment, one of 
the few such programs in the coun-
try, as a way to get around budget 
cuts and high demand for required 
courses. 

The state’s 112 community col-
leges sustained $1.5 billion in bud-
get cuts between 2007 and 2012.  
A two-year public college in this 
state typically charges $46 per unit, 
among the lowest in the country.

The five higher-priced winter 

courses at Long Beach included 
offerings in environmental science 
and geography. The college had to 
cancel a business course because 
of lack of interest. Critics decry 
the idea, saying it gives wealthier 
students an unfair advantage. “It 
creates two types of students: those 
who can pay and those who cannot. 
And it’s unfair to the students who 
have to feed families and are unem-
ployed,” said Andrea Donado, the 
student representative on the Long 
Beach Community College District 
Board of Trustees.

Of the 64 comments on the 
article posted on the Feb. 3, 2014, 
LA Times website, most were 
supportive of the current tuition 
pricing structures at California’s 
Community Colleges. 

One commentator remarked 
that free tuition was before Prop 13, 
while another doubted that public 
university chancellors were then 
making $600k per year.

good idea to establish a precedent 
of including the MTS line in our 
campus transportation. By taking 
the extra time until the general 
election, Council might be able to 
negotiate a better price for a trans-
portation pass than what was origi-
nally expected.

Whatever the pass looks like, 
it should last for a full year, as 
students have spent two-thirds of 
the 2014–15 school year unsure 
of when their bus stickers would 
expire and whether it would cost 
them to acquire new ones. 

What definitely shouldn’t 
happen in the next few months is 
a price increase, followed by more 

cuts to service anyway. Shuttles 
are an excellent resource for any 
campus, and particularly UCSD, 
as they decongest parking areas 
and reduce our carbon footprint. 
The consolidation of the Nobel 
shuttles already caused major 
headaches for off-campus students, 
with reports of impossibly long 
lines and MTS buses that simply 
couldn’t stop for more riders. 
Students living on campus as well 
as those in University Town Center 
depend on the shuttles, and they 
shouldn’t have to deal with fewer, 
more expensive shuttles. Ideally, the 
referendum would include a clause 
asking TPS to consider a freeze on 
any additional service cuts.

Though our opinions are pri-

marily directed at those writing 
and modifying the referendum, 
the rest of the student body isn’t 
off the hook either. Last year, the 
University Centers Advisory Board 
referendum didn’t even scrape 
enough votes to be considered 
legitimate. Transportation is an 
issue that our campus has been up 
in arms about for over a year, so 
here’s hoping that the voting results 
will reflect the activism we’ve seen. 
It’s an old saying that decisions are 
made by those who show up, and 
it’s important for us to take advan-
tage of any opportunity to send a 
message to the administration. 

So whether you vote yes or no, 
don’t forget to send us your letters 
to the editor.

Y oung the Giant, the Irvine-based quintet whose 2010 debut album produced catchy indie rock tunes like “Cough Syrup” and “My Body,” recently released their second 
album “Mind Over Matter.” Notable 
for its heavier sound, the guitar-based 
single “It’s About Time” has earned the 
band praise for their decision to opt 
for a harder sound while maintain-
ing the catchy melodies that defines 
their sunny SoCal sound. The UCSD 
Guardian spoke to guitarist Eric 
Cannata about their latest release, the 
struggle to overcome writer’s block and 
his favorite current bands.

Guardian: Could you explain the album 
title, “Mind Over Matter”?
Eric Cannata: After coming home 
from a long tour, we felt pressured to 
reconnect with the fans who had sup-
ported us for the past couple of years. 
We realized they have certain expecta-
tions. The idea of “Mind Over Matter” 
is that there are certain obstacles that 
you need to battle throughout your life, 
and some of the songs on the album are 
about moments of failure — a feeling 
of paralysis — while some of the songs 
are about getting over those difficul-
ties. Battling writer’s block and writing 
the title track got us out of our comfort 
zone.

G: Why was “It’s About Time” chosen 
as the lead single? Is it representative of the rest of the album as a 
whole?
EC: I think each song on “Mind Over Matter” has its own vibe, so 
it’s hard to pinpoint a sound that represents the entire album. The 
idea was that, when people listened to “It’s About Time” before 
we released it, and when we were listening it, we felt it showcased 
our growth as a band — we wanted to come out with something 

unexpected. We wanted to stay true to our roots as a rock band 
but go in a different direction other than the 
traditional verse-chorus structure. To me, 

the chorus on “It’s About 
Time” breaks down to some-
thing sonically unexpected.

G: Was there a different 
approach to making the second 
album as to avoid the so-called 
“sophomore slump” — the 
infamously, difficult second 
album?
EC: We were definitely more 
prepared this time around, 
and we have a lot more expe-
rience from playing live and 
touring. I think we got bet-
ter at songwriting together. 
We have a very democratic 
system. It takes some time, 
but everyone has their say. 
While trying to figure out our 
vision for the album sonically, 
we found a producer [Justin 
Meldal-Johnsen] who we 
thought could take that vision 
and make it grander. Also, 
like I said before, we wanted 
to get out of our comfort zone 
by trying to write songs in 
different ways using differ-
ent instruments; for example, 
starting a song with a synthe-

sizer rather guitars, which we’ve done in the past.

G: What have you been listening to lately?
EC: I think Arcade Fire is a great band. Here We Go Magic is 
another one. And Volcano Choir — I have to mention that — I’ve 
listened to their new album probably every day for the past couple 
of months. It’s Justin Vernon’s [of Bon Iver] most recent endeavor.

?

Every time I finish a record, I think, ‘Alright, my next record will [have] upbeat, pop songs.’” Greg Laswell chuckles in self-awareness. “But every time I get a chance, I end up gravitating towards sad 
stuff.”

The singer-songwriter and producer is notorious for 
composing melancholy ballads like “Comes and Goes (In 
Waves)” and “What a Day.” In fact, the musician has a knack 
for turning your favorite cheery tunes into the gloomiest 
songs you’ve ever heard: Take his minor-key, acoustic rendi-
tion of Cyndi Lauper’s “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,” which 
sparked controversy in 2011 after “Glee” used Laswell’s 
slowed-down composition without giving him credit.

But moody melody aside, Laswell is getting the last laugh, 
releasing a whole album’s worth of previously recorded songs 
all in the same vein of his Lauper rearrangement.

“I kind of covered myself !” Laswell says about his new 
record “I Was Going To Be an Astronaut.” “I love decon-
structing songs and changing them to the point where 
they’re almost unrecognizable.”

Despite the novel sound of the album’s several tracks, 
much of it is old news for his listeners.

“Before I started a new record altogether, I kept getting 
people coming up to me after shows … asking for [recorded] 
versions that I do of a lot of my songs [when I play live] 
because they differ quite a bit from [the original] recordings,” 
Laswell says. “And so it happened enough times to where I 
thought, ‘A lot of people keep asking for it. I’ll give it a try.’”

But “Astronaut” is more than simply a sampling of fan 
favorites or a unique spin on a “Best of ” album. It’s a purely 
San Diegan record, charting not only each track’s pre-pro-
duction sound but also Laswell’s own musical roots.

GUARDIAN GOES GLOBAL: J.WOK
The Guardian samples the world’s cuisine in San Diego. This week: Thailand.

When you approach it from the outside, j.wok looks like a futuristic warehouse, 
with wide doors and wood panel-
ing on the front — but it’s cozy and 
welcoming inside. With a mix of 
blue-collar comfort and chic interior 
design, j.wok is the perfect place to 
find delicious, Asian fusion dishes. 
Located between Horton Plaza and 
Petco Park, j.wok offers an easygoing 
restaurant to relax and take in the 
best that downtown San Diego has 
to offer.

J.wok’s menu features predomi-
nantly Thai curries and noodle dish-
es, but they also serve Korean and 
Chinese dishes, like kimchi and kung 
pao chicken. The appetizer menu has 
perhaps the greatest and most afford-
able variety, with dishes ranging from 

potstickers to egg rolls to short ribs. 
Get the most bang for your buck 
with the delicious chicken potstickers 
starter ($5.75) filled with cabbage, 
green onion and onion.

Before ordering your main course, 
take a gander at their drink menu. 
Looking around the restaurant, it’s 
clear that the Thai tea ($3.75; with 
boba, $4.25) is a customer favorite. 
But if you’re looking for something 
lighter, go for the mango iced tea 
($3.75). There are free refills, and an 
attentive wait staff will make sure you 
never get to the bottom of your cup.

As traditional Thai entrees go, 
j.wok offers two to-die-for curries, 
the yellow chicken curry and the red 
curry, in either entree or wrap form. 
The yellow chicken curry entree 
($10.25) comes with white-meat 
chicken, bell peppers, onion and 
potato. The red curry ($10.25) comes 
with your choice of tofu, chicken, 
beef or shrimp, zucchini, bell pep-
pers and onion. For the same price, 
you can turn either dish into a crispy 
roll. Both the entree version and the 
crispy roll version come with rice and 
a side salad. The side salad comes 
with either peanut or a spicy lime 
dressing. The rice comes steamed, 
brown or fried, but don’t hesitate to 
jump for the brown — j.wok cooks it 

to perfection.
If you aren’t in the mood for a 

salad-and-rice combination, don’t 
hesitate to ask your server for a 
substitute. The Tom Kha (regularly 
$4.75) comes with either chicken or 
tofu and is made with coconut milk, 
cabbage, mushroom, cilantro and 
limejuice. And if you prefer some-
thing light, then try one of j.wok’s 
several “little plates,” each less than 
$5. Guests can try out different fla-
vors for themselves or and share their 
plates buffet style.

 J.wok’s dessert menu has just 
four options, but it’s honestly all they 
need. Their fried banana with ice 
cream ($5.75) is melt-in-your-mouth 
goodness. The wait staff will refuse 
to disclose too much information 
about their “secret” J-OMG dish, but 
it’s worth taking a chance on — at the 
very least, you’ll learn how the dish 
got its name.

Next time you need a break after 
a day of Fashion Valley shopping or 
are heading to a Padres game, make 
a pit stop at j.wok. Its chill, industrial 
vibes will give you the break you 
need from a high-energy day and 
excellent food to boot.

“I owe San Diego a lot,” Laswell 
says. “Working on this record made 
me very nostalgic because I was 
basically re-recording pieces of the 
last seven years of my life so it took 
me back in time.”

Though he grew up in Long 
Beach, the singer-songwriter gradu-
ated from Point Loma Nazarene 
University and lived in San Diego 
at the start of his career, forming 
and fronting alternative rock band 
Shillglen. But since then, Laswell 
has flown solo as a musician and a 
producer, a success he credits to San 
Diego, although he is currently liv-
ing in New York City.

“I love San Diego — I miss it,” 
Laswell said. “I lived in LA for 
awhile, too, but … I find myself 
missing San Diego more. That’s 
where I got my start. … A friend 
of mine, [fellow San Diegan-based 
singer-songwriter] Anya Marina, … 
used to be on the radio [as a deejay] 
on 94.9. … She heard the record 
[‘Through Toledo’] and insisted that 
I look for a manager and hooked 
me up with my first manager, and 
really put the idea in my head to 
see what I get out of this album that 
I had just finished. So I credit her 
a lot and also San Diego, too. I got 
signed while I was in San Diego. It 
was a great place to learn how to 
perform and the San Diego Music 
Awards were always really kind to 
me. I miss those days. They were 
really, really like a community. It’s 
relatively small compared to LA or 
New York. … But the community 
that exists there is comforting and 
encouraging.”

Laswell jokingly confesses that 
he’s “looking forward to being in 
San Diego and eating Mexican 
food!”, but admits that he had 
weightier reasons for kicking off his 
tour for “Astronaut” in San Diego.

“I thought it would be fitting to 
do a full circle,” Laswell says. “I did 
my very first CD release show for 
‘Through Toledo,’ my first record, 
at Lestat’s. And so now I’m going 
to do my CD release show of this 
record at Lestat’s [on Feb. 11]. The 
only difference is, you know, I think 
there were twelve people there [at 
my first gig], and now both shows 

[for ‘Astronaut’ at Lestat’s] are sold 
out.”

Since his start in San Diego, 
the musician has rubbed shoulders 
with luminaries of both coasts: his 
close friend Elijah Wood starred in 
a music video for his hit “How the 
Day Sounds,” and his last record, 
2012’s “Landline,” featured col-
laborations with his musical peers, 
Sara Bareilles, Sia, Elizabeth and the 
Catapult and New York-based sing-
er-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson, 
whom he tied the knot with two 
years ago. But even living and occa-
sionally touring with the “Maybe” 
artist hasn’t changed Laswell’s out-
look on music. 

“[Michaelson and I] always 
laugh about it because we imagine 
that people picture us sitting at our 
house with guitars, writing and 
singing and doing music all the 
time, and they think that it must be 
this musical house,” Laswell says. 
“And it’s really not! … I think we 
just kind of subconsciously made a 
decision to just keep it separate.”

A purely independent artist, 
Laswell simply cannot be pinned 
down to one genre and concedes 
that he’s not strongly influenced by 
the music he listens to.

“People are always surprised 
to hear that I’m a huge metal fan,” 
Laswell said. “I love hard rock and 
heavy metal and old country like 
Johnny Cash … Whenever I do 
listen to music, it’s at least 20 years 
old, so I’m hard-pressed to think of 
anyone that I’m influenced by that 
is currently doing music. So I think 
it’s a weird mixture of late ’80s and 
’90s Tori Amos mixed with heavy 
metal.”

With plans to return to the 
studio to record another album at 
the end of his tour for “Astronaut,” 
San Diego’s own singer-songwriter 
continues to shoot for the stars and 
promises to keep delivering literate, 
elegant compositions. But whether 
Laswell will finally take a jauntier 
tone with his next record is yet to 
be seen, but one thing is for sure:

“I can’t do heavy metal [covers],” 
Laswell says with a laugh. “I think it 
would confuse other people.”

RESTAURANT  REVIEW

H ow can it be possible that the course of events of World War II was significantly altered by 
a small group of museum directors, 
curators and art historians?

George Clooney, adding another 
directorial credit alongside “Good 
Night, and Good Luck” and “The Ides 
of March,” teams up with his actor 
pals — Matt Damon, Bill Murray and 
John Goodman, among others — to 
tell the story of one of the greatest 
treasure hunts in history, where the 
prizes are not gold but Rembrandts 
and Rubenses.

Based on a book by Robert 
M. Edsel, as well as the actual 
Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives 
unit commissioned by the U.S. gov-
ernment, “The Monuments Men” is 
a race-against-time film about the 
little known art preservation efforts 
conducted in Europe during World 

War II. Confronting the final chap-
ter of Hitler’s Reich, Clooney plays 
the dignified George L. Stout, a role 
based on the real-life museum direc-
tor and art connoisseur tasked with 
a seemingly impossible mission: to 
infiltrate enemy lines in order to 
save countless pieces of hidden art 
stolen by Nazi thieves before they 
are destroyed by Hitler.

The central question of the movie 
becomes evident early on: Is this 
unlikely group of characters willing 
to risk their lives and the lives of their 
fellow comrades in order to save some 
Michelangelos and Picassos? With the 
amount of people dying during war-
time, who cares about art? Is saving 
art worth the sacrifice of human life?

Clooney treats the subject matter 
with reverence and sentimentality, a 
contrast to the explosions and gore 
that usually dominate war movies, 

showcasing how art is linked to human 
achievements and culture. When art is 
in danger of being lost forever, so are 
centuries of human history. Credited 
with one of the more poignant lines 
of the movie, Clooney’s character asks, 
“Who will make sure the Mona Lisa is 
still smiling?”

Skeptics might be tempted to 
overlook the movie, quickly dis-
missing it as just another World 
War II movie to add to the pile 
along with Tarantino’s somewhat 
recent out-of-control Nazi killing 
spree, “Inglourious Basterds.” On 
the contrary, “The Monuments 
Men” is heartfelt. (Well, as heart-
felt as a movie that takes place in 
Nazi Germany can be.) The story 
is adorned with funny dialogue — 
John Goodman’s physical comedy 
provides many laughs, as do Matt 
Damon’s attempts to speak French 
— and, in the end, ends up being 
memorable not only because of the 
suspenseful storyline but also the 
camaraderie within the group.

Just when we thought Hollywood 
had wrung the World War II movie 
genre dry, “The Monuments Men” 
provides a refreshing point of view, 
shedding light on the value of cul-
tural artifacts — something with the 
unexpected ability to connect us dur-
ing a time when the world seemed 
more disconnected than ever before.

Young Triton Squad Will Host Concor-
LQI�WV�.MJ�����)b][I�8IKQÅK�WV�.MJ���
▶ TENNIS, from page 12
the pair came back from a 6 –2 deficit 
and rallied against Nicole Koehly and 
Layla Sanders to record a 9–8 victory 
in the No. 1 slot. 

LaPlante noted that this year’s 
team is far younger than past rosters 
and that the team is hoping to gain 
experience in its early matchups. 

“We have a lot of strong freshmen 
that are starting,” LaPlante said. “We 
have a lot of really tough matches 
coming up, so I’m hoping they will 

continue to get their confidence up 
and play up to their potential.” 

After its opening weekend, 
UCSD’s young squad now look ahead 
to a full slate of matches with few 
breaks in between. 

The Tritons will next host 
Concordia on Thursday, Feb. 6 at 2 
p.m. and Azusa Pacific on Friday, Feb. 
7 at 3 p.m.

SWIMMING  AND  DIVING

Tritons End Regular Season With Victory
UCSD defeats University of San Diego, looks toward conference championships.

The UCSD women’s swim and 
dive team finished off its 2013–14 
regular season on a high note as 
it cruised past crosstown rival 
University of San Diego 189.5–108.5 
at USD’s Sports Center Pool on 
Saturday. The Tritons had recently 
moved up from No. 6 to No. 5 on 
Friday and completed their dual-
meet schedule with a record of 8–6 
after the win against USD. 

UCSD is now 11-1-1 over its last 
thirteen annual meetings with the 
USD Toreros.

“It’s always a good meet with 
USD,” UCSD assistant women’s 
swim coach Dan Perdew said. “It’s 
been pretty close over the last few 
years, and we saw a lot of excitement 
from the team going into the meet.”

Senior co-captain Anji Shakya, 
recently named one of the seven 
amateur Stars of the Year for 2013 

by the San Diego Hall of Champions, 
and freshman Jaimie Bryan were 
the stars of the meet, each winning 
three individual events. Shakya won 
the 200 freestyle (1:51.95), 200 back-
stroke (2:07.96) and 500 freestyle 
(5:02.09) with a comfortable lead of 
at least a second and a half. Shakya 
also served as anchor for the 200 
freestyle relay behind sophomore 
Colleen Daley, freshman Austine 
Lee and junior Sierra Robbins, con-
tributing to the first place win.

Bryan won the 100 and 200 
breaststroke comfortably, with times 
of 1:06.62 and 2:23.0, respectively. 
The freshman also took the 200 indi-
vidual medley with a time of 2:11.24, 
just seconds before teammate soph-
omore Naomi Thomas who finished 
second with a time of 2:14.31. 

Other victories included a win 
from Daley, who took the 50 free-
style with a time of 23.87, just ahead 
of fellow teammate, junior Jaclyn 

Amog, who finished with 24.57. 
Daley placed second in the 100 free-
style (53.04). 

Among the seniors, Sandy 
Hon earned top honors in the 100 
backstroke with a season-best of 
58.63. Fellow senior, diver Natalie 
Mouzooni scored the highest total 
across four competitors on the one-
meter springboard, scoring a 208.95. 

With the regular season behind 
them, UCSD can now look for-
ward to the Pacific Collegiate 
Swimming and Diving Conference 
Championships next week, Feb. 12 
through Feb. 15 in La Mirada. 

“We’re excited, training well and 
we’re in a great place mentally,” 
Perdew said. “We’ve seen a lot of 
great swimming this winter, and 
we’re looking forward to the chal-
lenge.”

The UCSD women’s tennis 
team kicked off its 2014 season on 
Saturday, Feb. 1 with a strong 6–3 
victory at home against Division-III 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, followed 
by an 8–1 home loss to Division-I UC 
Davis on Sunday. 

In their first contest of the year, the 
Tritons performed well in singles play, 
taking four of the six total matches. In 
the No. 1 singles slot, sophomore 
standout Kyra Scott handily defeat-
ed Katie Kuosman (6–2, 6–0). Scott 
expressed confidence in her abilities 
but was quick to acknowledge room 
for improvement.  

“I’m very consistent,” Scott said. 
“I’m working on trying to get a little 
bit more power on my serve and 
some other shots. I missed a couple 
volleys in doubles, but I’ll clean that 
up.” 

In singles play, three other Triton 
victories came via freshman Nava 
Nowamooz in the No. 4 slot over 
Yvonne Likomanova (6 –4, 6–2). 

UCSD freshman Shannon Theisen 
in the No. 5 slot bested Victoria 
Nichols (6–1, 6–2) and junior Kellie 

Taylor in the No. 6 slot won over Erin 
Coughlin (6 –3, 6–3). 

In the doubles component, UCSD 
took two of its three contests as the 
team of Scott and sophomore Paula 
Chou defeated Caroline Ward and 
Kuosman (8–6) in the No. 1 slot, 
while senior Tara Vanooteghem 
and junior Laura Wilke downed 
Likomanova and Sheena Patel (8 –3) 
in the No. 3 slot. 

“I think the doubles teams this 
year are going to be much stronger 
than last year,” Scott said. “Everyone’s 
working really well together.” 

On Sunday, the Tritons struggled 
to keep up with UC Davis.

The Aggies dominated, sweeping 
all six singles matches against UCSD, 
while only surrendering one loss out 
of three total doubles contests. 

“It was just a good test to see what 
we need to work on,” UCSD head 
coach Liz LaPlante said. “Playing bet-
ter competition gets us ready for our 
important, Division-II competition.”

In spite of the tough, overall loss, 
the doubles team of Scott and Chou 
provided optimism for the Tritons, as

UCSD Splits in Openers
The Tritons win against Claremont, fall to UC Davis.

In last Sunday’s season opener, the No. 39 Tritons swept in a non-con-
ference doubleheader against Holy Names University. !e Tritons handily 
beat the Hawks in both games, scoring 20 total runs on 22 hits and only 
allowing one run on nine hits.

“Our defense played great today,” UCSD head coach Eric Newman said 
to the UCSD Athletics Department. “We made one error in 18 innings, 
pitching and defense is what we’re going to hang our hat on this year.”

In the "rst match, senior le# "elder Justin Rahn hit a three-RBI double 
in the "rst inning to put UCSD on the scoreboard. Up 3–0 in the third 
inning, senior catcher Nick La Face — a two-time Daktronics All-West 
Region selection — hit an RBI double. Shortly a#er, junior transfer, "rst 
baseman Michael Mann would bat La Face home to give the Tritons a 5–0 
lead.
!e Hawks’ lone run of the day came in the fourth inning when junior 

Zach Verlaan hit a double and was able to score two pitches later. !e 
Tritons struck again in the "#h inning, scoring three unearned runs o$ 
Holy Names errors. !e Tritons would strike twice more in the seventh and 
once in the eighth to "nish their "rst game of the season with an 11–1 win, 
scoring 11 runs o$ of 12 hits and no errors.

UCSD senior pitcher Blake Fassler only allowed one run on four hits 
and threw six strikeouts. Fassler pitched "ve innings before sophomore 
right-hander Adrian Orozco took over for three before handing the ball to 
senior right-hander Scott Zeman, who closed with both allowing one hit.

UCSD showed no slowing in its second game Sunday. As in the "rst 
game, Rahn — named the conference player of the week last Sunday — 
started o$ the scoring in the second inning with a two-run homer over 
center "eld to give the Tritons a 2–0 lead. Later in the inning, with the 
bases loaded, a wild pitch allowed freshman out"elder Christian Leung to 
score.
!e third inning was quiet on both fronts, but UCSD scored six runs 

o$ of "ve hits in the fourth. Sophomore out"elder Corbin Wirta, senior 
in"elder Spencer Frazier, junior in"elder Erik Lewis, Mann and junior 
catcher Brett Levy all registered RBI in the fourth inning, with Lewis gain-
ing two o$ a well placed single.

“On o$ense, we want to be disciplined when it’s time to be disciplined 
and aggressive when it’s time to be aggressive,” Newman said to the UCSD 
Athletics Department. “I thought we really did a good job of that today.”
!e rest of the game was silent as junior pitcher Dan Kolodin threw "ve 

scoreless innings with only two hits. Junior pitcher Chad Rieser took over 
for the sixth through eighth innings and held the shutout, while sopho-
more closer Troy Cruz pitched a perfect ninth for the 9–0 win. !e Tritons 
scored nine runs o$ ten hits with one error while the Hawks had no runs 
o$ three hits and one error.

On Feb. 8 the Tritons will kick o$ conference play against reigning 
CCAA tournament champion Cal State Los Angeles in another double-
header at Triton Ballpark.
