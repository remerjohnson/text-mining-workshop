Seat belt law 
takes effect 

Under California 'S new safety 
belt usage law that took effect 
January I , 1986, both drivers and 
passengers will be required to 
wear searoelts. 

Drivers who do not comply 
with the new law will face fines

California Highway Patrol's 
4,700 officers will strictly enforce 
the law in the 3 million stopS 
they make annually on state 
highways, said California 
Highway Patrol spokesman Kent 
Milton . 

Additional proVlsions of the 
law state: 
• drivers and passengers will be 
ticketed individually for not 
wearing seat belts; 
• passengers driving older 
model cars not onginally 
equipped with seat belts are 
exempt; 
• motorists with physical 
disabilities that make seatbelt use 
Impractical are exempt if cleared 
by a phYSICian; 
• CitatIOn can be Issued only If 
the dnver has been stopped for 
another violation, and 
• aulO makers w III be reqUired to

Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown CD-San FranCISCo), who 
authored the CalifornIa law, 
added an automatic restramts

The provision came In 
response co a U .. Department of 
Transportanon order that aU cars

UC studies library 
automation 

UC will undertake a maJol 
study of hbraf} automation al the 
umversuy, focu 109 both on the 
campuse~ and on the system a3 
a whole. The commmee and 
dates for the UCSD stud}' have 
yet to be estabh shed. 

"Technology IS changing so 
rapidly In hbrary aUlOmanon that 
we need to reassure ourselves 
that the dIrection we've chosen 
to go with is optimal. Or, if It 'S 
not , we need to change that 
direction ," said Wilham Frazer, 
UCs vice preSIdent for academiC 
affaIrS. 

The reason the study IS 
Important is the increasmg 
popularity of UCs electromc 
catalogue system MELVYL, Frazer 
said. As more facult}, use office 

computers to ,!Ccess the 
atalogue. the com puting power 

of the s}'stem IS In rea singly 
hard -pressed to provide 
response within reasonable time 
'limits. The study groups Frazer i 
appointing will look mto the 
different library automation 
projects and decide whether 
MELVYL's relative importance 
entitles It to more funding. 
Scripps scientist 
tags white sharks 

Two white sharks in the ocean 
waters surrounding the outheast 
Farallon Island in the Point 
Reyes/ Farallon National Marine 
anctuary have been tagged with 
d~~~~0!1i( lnstruments for shark 
behavioral studies conducted by 
Dr. A Peter Klimley, a research 
scientist in marine biology at 
UCSD's Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, La Jolla, Calif. 

The study focuses on the 
white sharks' home ranges, their 
daily behavior, and how their 
activities are influenced by 
environmental factors . 

White sharks are abundant in 
the sanctuary, and through 
predation on seals and sea lions, 
they probably have a major 
impact on the area's marine 
ecosystem. More adult white 
sharks are caught along the 
sanctuary's coastline, extending 
from the Farallon Islands to 
Tomales Bay and Bodega Bay, 
than along any other location on 
the west coast of :'\orth America. 
accordi ng to Khmley. The island 
where the sharks were tagged IS 
approximately 18 mtles from the

Roger Hedgecock. Mayor of the City of San Diego, reSigned from office In 
December. 

San Diego needs mayor 
By DANIEL THOMAS 

SAN DIEGANS have been forced to elect a ne ..... mayor foUowing Mayor Roger 
Hedgecock's resignation and 
sentencing December 11, 1985. 

Acting Mayor Ed Struiksma 
recommended holding an 
election to fill the remainder of 
the term. 

The primary election for the 
vacancy wiU be on February 25, 
1986. If no candidate gets more 
than 50 percent of that vote , the 
top twO will run 10 a final 
election on June 3, the date of 
the regular 19 6 statewide 
pnmary. 

City Council Member and 
Acting Mayor Ed Struiksma made 
his last-minute announcement of 
candidacy on the afternoon of 
Thursday, January 2. 

The filing deadlme was 
January 3, 1986. That evening, a 
few minutes after the deadline, 
Dean Klampe of the Clerk's 
elections office released the 
names and self-descriptions of 
those persons who had 
completed the filing, and who 
will aU probably be on the 
pnmary ballot of February 25 . 

They are: Mary Christian 
Heising, Pollrical Scientist, 56; 
Bill Cleator, City Council 
Member, 58; David Crane.

There was speculation that 
Chief of Poltce William Kollander 
would run . However, when the 
election was declared , Kollander 
did not file for candidacy. 

The comest may "realistically" 
be between CleaLOr, O'Connor, 
Struiksma and Morrow, 
according to local political 
columnists. 

Republicans now fear 
Struiksma's last minute filmg 
might split their fund -raising 
between Cleator and Struiksma. 

This year's mayoral election is 
the third such vote in four years; 
a series of changes began when 
Pete Wtlson resigned following 
his 1982 election 10 the U.S. 
Senate. Roger Hedgecock was 
first elected Mayor in 1983 to 
serve the remaining part of 
Wilson's third term; Hedgecock 
was then reelected in 1984. 

The next regularly scheduled 
mayoral election is in 1988.

City are part of the San Diego

Media budget proposal: source of controversy 
By JOHN SCHACHT 

A PROPOSAL to restructure funding for UCSD's alternative media -
brought before the AS council on 
December 4 and then labeled 
over the Christmas vacation -
is scheduled to come up before 
the AS this Wednesday, January 
8, but its author, 
Communications Commissioner 
Michael Fahlbusch, has stated 
that another postponement is 
likely. 

The controversial proposal 
seeks to limit the funding of 
each of the campus' seven 

AS III (./(11011 

alternative pub\t ' ations to 
$4,000. The money comes from 
student actiVIty fees. 

The proposed plan would give 
each publication enough money 
to publish twice a quarter. There 
would be no restrictions on 
additional issues, but funds 
would have to be generated by 
the media themselves. Current 
funding limits each publication 
to no more than 25 percent of 
the $47,000 allocated for all the 
publications. 

Reaction to the proposal has 
been predominantly r:legative 
from the alternative media 
themselves, even though some 
could receive an increase under 
the plan. At the studem forum 
on December 4, the California 
Review was the only publication 
voicing support of the proposal. 

Negative reaction to the ceiling 
proposal has focused on the 
timing of the proposal, the fact 
that Fahlbusch did not consult 
with any of the publications 
before making the proposal, the 
lack of srudent input, and the 
"ideological attack" aUegedly 
underlying the plan. 
Representatives of the 
publications opposing the 
proposal also feel that many 

avenues remam unexplored and 
that the media board is negligent 
in its duties because it has not 
researched other alternatives. 

"We decry the fact that the 
medias were not consulted , and 
that no meeting of the media 
board was called ," said Chris 
Harrington of the Koala, "we 
don't believe a $4,000 ceiling is 
the answer. " 

"As far as the timing of the 
proposal is concerned," 
Fahlbusch said, "I was nm trying 
to railroad it through before the 
vacation - I just felt that it was 
time to make people aware of 
the problem. I could have got it 
through, I believe , but I wanted 
to stir things up and get some 
concrete feedb ack, instead of th e 
usual call for more money. Some 
of these journals feel they have 
some SOrt of ordamrd nght to 
money " 

Students arfth,Hed with the 
alternati\e meUIJ , however, leel 
thar the real I,,~ue IS "not 
equahf), but umfllrrmty" said 
Dan F pperly of the nt'W IndICator 
"It's another case of the media 
board acting In the best interests 
of the administration, not the 
students," Epperly said. "The 
administration has wanted us off 
the cam pus for years." Fahlbusch 
contends that the ceiling is not 
an ideolgical attack on the n.i. ; 
"The n.i. just happens to be in 
the position of receiVing the 
most money," he said. 

Many in the alternative media 
feel that the question of student 
support was deciaed by the 
referendum in spring of1984, 
when students voted against a 
$20,000 ceiling for the entire 
media budget (excluding KSDT), 
proposed by former 
Communications Commissioner 
Tim Pickwell. "The students 
voted at that time that they 
would rather have no ceiling on 
the alternative media than 
Pickwell's," Epperly said, "which 
said to us that cutting budgets 
was not the answer - the 
students didn't want it. "Ever 
since I've been at UCSD," 
Fahlbusch said, "some of the 
media keep talking about the 
large base of support they have. 
But I don't think it exists - the 
1984 referendum was so 
ambiguously worded that it could

be Interpreted 100 many ways. If 
I see a mass of opposition to my 
plan, I'll withdraw and say it was 
a mistake , but if I see the same 
old core come up with any plan 
for augmenting the budget for 
the new medias, I won't even 

look at it - the money IS JUSt 
not there." 

The Journals met over the 
vacation with AS President Mary 
Rose Alexander. They said they 
felt unexplored options remam 
to be studied. "That was our 

maIO objection (0 the plan ," 
Byron Morton of the new 
Indicator said, "there were no 
feasibility studies made, and our

UCSD's Twenty-fifth anniversary series 
A committee composed of 

organizations on campus met on 
December 5 to discuss the UCSD 
Bookstore. 

The meeting was chaired by 
Roy Ritchie of the History 
Department and included 
representatives from the AS, Muir 
College, Third College, UCSD 
Medical School , the Business 
Affairs Office and the UCSD 
libraries. 

In an eITort to provide 
selection and convenience, 
according to a bookstore 
representative, the Bookstore will 
move into the soon to be 
completed University Center, 
which will allow aU of the 
departments to double in size. 

The UCSD Bookstore has 
increased their prices over the 
suggested retail price (set by the 
publishers), but nevertheless has 
the same profit maT)!,ins as the

rest of the country. They aim to 
ha ve neither the highest nor the 
lowest prices and consider their 
public image when pricing 
books, according to Paul Mares, 
General Manager of the 
bookstore. In the interest of 
improving their image, the UCSD 
Bookstore has decreased its 
former 26 percent profit margin 
over the publisher's suggested 
retail price to 23 percent, which 
places it in the middle price 
range of California University 
Bookstores, Mares said . 

The UCLA and UCB 
Bookstores charge less for 
texroooks because they have 
major sports programs and can 
make up for their losses on items 
such as clothing, which are in 
high demand by alumni and the 
general public, said a bookstore 
representativt' . 

Both UCLA and the UCB 

Bookstores are AS owned. Thus , 
one must take into account the 
environment in which the 
individual bookstore exists when 
comparing prices. 

One student raised the point 
of customer service which, she 
said, is frequently discourteous. 
In an attempt to resolve this 
frequent complaint, Mares said, 
the UCSD Bookstore is in the 
process of "recon~ing" its 

departments and WIT! provide a 
combined special 
orderlinformation desk staffed 
by an employee whose sole job is 
to help customers. 

In addition, the UCSD 
Bookstore will be proViding 
shopping baskets this quarter, 
Mares said . 

The Bookstore is owned by 
the UC Regents, who provided 
the initial investment capital.

A question of money, the media and equality 
It's a new battle between the AS and alternative media but the war is 

growing old . Communications Commissioner Michael Fahlbusch's new 
proposal to fund all nine current media equally, at a $4,000 ceiling, will 
do away with the ridiculous and unfair ritual of hammering out a new 
budget every year and will eradicate the somewhat questionable practice 
of the AS financially supporting one journal more than another. It's toO 
bad Fahlbusch proposed the idea in such a sloppy way. Those journals 
directly involved by the proposal (Alternative Visions , the Birdcage Review, 
the California Review, the Koala , La Voz , L'Chayim, the new indicator, 
People's Voice, and Sappho Speaks should have been allowed input in the 
matter and the time to submit their own alternatives before Fahlbusch 
dragged the proposal before the Council last December. 

mcrease In funds they'll have to earn it themselves. The new proposal 
promises all the existing media $4,000 a year, enough to publish two 
12-page issues a quarter, and allows all new papers up to $2,500 in seed 
money to prove themselves in a year probation period. The equal 
allocation does not favor or extinguish any viewpoint; $4,000 should be 
enough for any group to publish more or larger issues, it's time they 
took the financial responSibility for it. Money is the reality in publishing 
a newspaper. 

However, having any type of government, even our AS, fund a 
newspaper is dangerous because it negates editorial independence. You 
can't print (our views if you don 't have money to pay for paper and ink. 
Freedom 0 speech does not entail government sponsorship , only its 
protection and right to exist. It's a mistake to be finanCially dependent 
on an organization whose members and priorities change yearly. 

But in exchange for this freedom the alternative media gains security 
in the importance the AS places on allowing students to express their 
beliefs. The AS does playa vital role in exposing students to varying and 
even unpopular ideas and philosophies. This is, after all, an institution 
of higher learning. A happy medium, comends Fahlbusch , is to offer 
equal funding for all journals requesting it. This is the safest and fairest 
way if the AS is going to continue to support campus media. It prevents 
the AS from favoring one paper over another, but it also burdens them 
with the financial responsibility of supporting an unlimited number of 
student newspapers. We hope the AS realizes this when it votes on the 
proposal this Wednesday. 

Dan Epperly of the new indicator, which was budgeted $9,742 this 
year ($2 ,000 more than any of the other eight journals) and will 
consequently be hit the hardest by Fahlbusch's proposal, claims the 
commissioner's action is blatant discrimination against the journal. But 
if there is one paper on campus that has been treated favorably by our 
AS, it's the new indicator, who, after all, has been receiving the most 
funding year in and year out. 

Money is the alternative media's problem and money is its solution. If 
the AS isn't giving the paper enough then they should be out selling 
advertiSing, finding subscribers or holding fund raisers. If strong suppOrt 
exists for their publications, they should take advantage of it. We realize 
that La Jolla isn't Berkeley and advertisors are hard to find for most of 
the alternative papers, but it does exist and they'll just have to work 
harder to find it. The objective is not to make a profit but to make 
enough money to print. 

Commissioner Fahlbusch must take equal blame for the media's 
dependence on AS dollars. Juggling the monetary proportions isn't going 
to bring in more money. Why doesn 't his proposal offer incentives for 
the papers to go after outside money? Give a starving man a fish and 
he'll eat for a day; teach him how to catch his own and he'll eat for the 
rest of his life. 

It would be great if the AS had enough money to give the alternative 
media all they wished , but they don't, and if the journals want an 

Out of financial independence comes editorial independence. 

Coop housing blues 
By MONTE ROSEN 

Cooperative housing has been 
a long, unfoldmg viSIOn at 
UCSD, WIth a modem twist. First 
proposed to the administration 
by interested and motivated 
students m 1979, it received 
some minor attention , but was 
stopped dead by the grossly 
expensive Environmental Impact 
Study (in 1979 at a cost of 
$25,000.00). ThIS fi nancial 
constraint undercut the thrust of 

the housing project, which tried 
to create on-campus, student 
owned and operated cooperative 
hOUSing. A student referendum to 
look into the subject was passed 
last year and the AS has formed 
a committee to study the coop 
future , but is still seeking srudent 
panicipation. The bottom line is 
that creation of any hOUSing by 
students IS an issue which affects 
all of us and depends enitrely on 

the students' wiilingness [0 work 
to make it happen. Why should 
you care? 

If you have spent any time 
livi ng on this campus, you might 
have an understanding of its un-
fulfilling nature. Living on-
campus does not prepare you [0 
live anywhere else. It's nothing 
more than an expensive grace 
period after your parents send 
you off to school. If the idea of 

hVing in on-campus housing fills 
you with revulsion, you 're forced 
to learn about the options. Most 
UCSD students Opt for living in 
off-campus houses, apanments, 
or condos. The majority have 
discovered the reality of high 
rents and other hassles. 

In response to the alienating 
choices presented to students, 
cooperative organizations asked 
in a Spring '85 referendum 
question, "Do you support the 
creation of on-campus student-
owned and operated cooperative 
housing?" Student support 
overwhelmingly favored creating 
Co-op Housin~. Thus the initial 

vision of alternative on-campus 
housing produced a powerful 
student mandate, and provided 
elected student representatives 
and administrative officials with 
a clear voting beacon. Later 
Chancellor Atkinson said he 
supponed this kind of hOUSing, 
an idea only the referendum 
could instill. 

It might help to define the 
type of project being undertaken. 
This idea of coopera tion is as 
old as mankind. Cooperatives, 
however, have an identifiable 
nineteenth century hiStory. They 
differed from other utopian

Altering view 

Editor: 
We the undersigned are 

opposed [0 the AS. 
Communications Commissioner 
Michael Fahlbusch's media 
budget cut proposal for the 
following reasons: 
• It appears to be only a tactic 
to harrass some members of the 
Alternative Media and to disrupt 
some media production 
schedules. 
• The proposal itself is a five 
page diatribe filled with 
inaccuracies and cliches, pulled 
out of thin air. 
• The proposal was drawn up 
without the benefit of student 
input. 
• At no time did Mr. Fahlbusch 
discuss the issues with members 
of the Alternative Media in order 
[0 come, up with a more realistic 
proposal. 
• At no time did Mr. Fahlbusch 
seek the advice of the several 
UCSD experts in mass 
communications. 
• Mr. Fahlbusch has repeatedly 

made public statements against 
the progressive press on campus. 
• Over the Christmas holidays 
Mr. Fahlbusch, and the AS. 
preSident conspired unilaterally 
and without the knowledge of 
the AS. Council to freeze the 
new indicator budget and thereby 
delayed the production of their 
first issue in 1986. 

For the above reasons, we feel 
that Mr. Fahlbusch is as 
contemptuous of student opinion 
as he is ignorant of the 
operations and functions of a 
campus/community newspaper. 

Mr. Fahlbusch did not 
campaign for the post he now 
occupies with promises [0 slash 
the budgets of the progressive 
press in the name of "eqUity." 
Now he has done this in a 
proposal which we can only find 
unacceptable because it is 
UNDEMOCRATIC and grossly 
INCOMPETANT (sic).

More than meatballs 
An open letter to UCSD students: 

I'd like to take a few moments 
of your day and tell you about 
something you may nO( have 
heard of, and if you have, you 
probably dismissed it as wishful 
thinking or impractical. 

The place is called Sweden 
and the program is called the 
Education Abroad Program 
(EAP). Right now, here in 
Sweden, there are 18 students 
from UC, three from UCSD, who 
are haVIng the time 01 their lives. 
What we are doing here in 
Sweden is somewhat similar to 
what you are doing at UCSD. but 
at the same lime, it's completely 
different We are living here in 

Sweden, almost as if we were 
Swedes. You may ask, how could 
those Americans almost be 
Swedes since Swedes speak 
Swedish and there is no Swedish 
at UCSD. It's taken care of. You 
don't have to have any language 
background since you learn 
Swedish here during the summer 
before the official school starts 
and during the fall tenn . 

We live in corridors with 10 
to 12 other people, all sharing a 
common, fully-equiped kitchen. 
We live in single rooms, which 
are bigger than the double rooms 
in Argo Hall and have private 
bathrooms with showu. The 
other people on the co-ed 
corridor are nO( feUow Americans 
but rather Swedish students, 
some from the nonhern reaches 
of Sweden, some from close by 
Lund (the city where we live) in 
the south end of Sweden. And 
Swedes are fantastic people. 
They are friendly, helpful and 
(most Imponantly for us) very 
patient with our newly learned 
Swedish . You live With them, talk 
with them, and buy your food 
from them . The environment IS 

Swedish. 
The whole point of this letter 

is to make you aware mat there 
is a great program available in 
Sweden for adventurous students. 
That does not mean JUSt juniors, 
as the flyers tend to suggest. In 
addition to juniors, our program 
has founh-year seniors, fifth-year 
seniors (finishing up over here) 
and grad-students. Our group 
has a wide range of majors, 
including Microbio, 
Anthropology, Kinesiology, 
Music, Political Science, Drama 
and Math. 

The University of Lund (which 
is where you take classes over 
here in Sweden) is world-class, 
with a broad range of 
depanments for whatever line of 
study you are going through , 
even if it is • American Political 
Systems." For those of you who 
feel like this might interrupt your 
scholastic plans for higher 
education, I can point out that 
we have a pre-med, pre-law, and 
a pre-veterinary med among us.

by a mile. Student social hfe here

potent fixes in the form of 
military hardware. This mindset 
is pervasive from the lowest paid 
employees in a defense 
installation or military unit to the 
Pentagon's joint Chiefs of Staff to 
the President himself. And like 
the chronic drug addict, the 
outcome ultimately leads to self 
destruction. But in this case 
millions of innocent people are 
in jeopardy of suffering the same 
consequences. 

Administration's largest 
peacetime military buildup in 
U.S. history, this country will , by 
1988, be pumping into the 
defense budget $87 of every 
$100 of capital investment, 
which could be going into the 
private sector, according to 
Seymour Melman, senior 

industrial engineer at New York's 
Columbia University. 

Despite huge sums of money 
being funneled into the Pentagon 
and defense contractors, the 
monthly economic statistics of 
the nation show the general 
economy is in the doldrums. The 
Commerce Depanment's 
measurement of the leading 
economic indicators rose a 
dismal 0.1 percent in November. 
Yet Reagan Administration 
bigwigs regularly gloat about 

folly alone is projected to cost an 
estimated $1 trillion . Incredibly, 
a majority of Americans polled 
by Gallup approve spending 
whatever amount Reagan deems 
necessary to erect a shield that, 
at best, might block 90 percent 
of incoming nuclear warheads 
launched by the Soviet Union. It 
will still allow in about 1,000 
strategic weapons - based on 
1985's count - or enough to kill 
almost all 240 million Americans. 

If you don't believe the 
defense-industry pannership 
isn't intoxicated by massive 
doses of taxpayer-provided 
revenue, consider this: by 1990 
enough money will have been 
spent on weapons-related 
projects, over a 45 year period 
- nearly $4 trillion , based on 
1972 dollars - to, in 1983 
values, buy every house , building, 
corporation , plane, car, 
appliance, furniture, that is every 
material object in America. At 
this moment, six million of this 
country's best minds are 
directing their God-given talents 
toward creating ever more lethal 
weapons systems instead of 
working on a cure for cancer or 
similar humanitarian endeavors. 

In 1980, prior to Ronald 
Reagan's election, [or every $100 
of new capital invested in the 
civilian sector some $38 was 
siphoned off to fuel various 
military-related activities. In 
japan, in contrast, only $4 per 
$100 went to defense outlays.

these persistently abysmal 
figures , describing them as being 
vinually as rosy as Nancy 
Reagan's cheeks. But ask the 
man or woman on the steet their 
opinion and lhey will credit 
Reagan with turning the country 
around. A more accurate 
description is that Reagan, led by 
his more intelligent handlers, has 
succeeded only in turning the 
economy squarely on its head. 

For example , factory orders for 
"big ticket," durable goods, rose 
0.9 percent in November. But if 
it were not for the defense 
orders to contractors which 
increased a whopping 17.2 
percent, the acrual figures would 
have shown a drop of 0.3 
percent, indicating the economy 
is basically £Iat. 

If military spending wasn't 
already out of control, the 
President wanlS to increase 
defense expenditures, despite 
being responsible for a five-year 
annual budget deficit totalling 
$2.2 trillion. Rea,l(an's "Star Wars" 

The economic repercussions 
of uncontrolled defense spending 
are making themselves known in 
myriad ways. The joint 
Economic Committee, a 
nonpartisan co ngressional 
investigatory arm of the House, 
found that income among 
families with ch ildren -
representing 53.3 percent of the 
nation's popUlation - had an 
income drop of 19 percent from 
1973 to 1984. Single parent 
households had incomes some 
40 percent lower than the 
average incomes for two-parent 
households. The situation has 
worsened considerably, 
beginning in this decade . 

Thiny years ago President 
Dwight David Eisenhower 
forewarned what is now 
happening. "There is no way," he 
said, "in which a COUntry can 
satisfy the craving for absolute 
security - but it can bankrupt 
itself, morally and economically, 
in attempting to reach the 
illusionary goal through arms 
alone." ~

Continued from page .. 
visions because they tied directly 
into the work-place and sought 
answers to the existing problems 
with concrete solutions. 
Cooperative societies sprung up 
and found a comfortable place in 
a depression-era America. On 
UC Berkeley'S campus the 
COUntry's first student 
cooperative housing association 
was founded in 1932. Berkeley's 
clear example and other student 
run hOUSing associations show 
that cooperative housing is not 
only financially feasible , but a 
practical, inexpensive solution to 
the continually rising need for 
student housing. Cooperative 
experiments at other campuses 
have shown that a non-profit 
cooperative has the capital 
means to enlarge its propeny 
holdings, providing greater 
student access to inexpensive 
housing without exploiting the 
student members and residents 
of the corporation . 

The initiation of variated 
quota systems provides 
protection against race and sex 
discrimination a claim no 
fraternity or sorority house can 
make. This also opens the 
channels to federal housing 
grants. 

The only block to the 
successful culmination of this 
student mandate is your lack of 
participation, only solid 
commitment to student 
cooperative living will make this 

on-gOing vision real. 
In 1979, the students who 

helped create coops believed 
student cooperative housing 
projects would be an excellent 
extension of the thriving coop 
network. They faced the same 
housing dilemmas we are facing 
today, but like all good coopers, 
they pursued their desires with 
concrete action. Out of their 
organization, cooperative 
resources from state and federal 
agencies were pursued to create 
housing at the least possible cost 
to students. Likewise, other 
campus student housing 
cooperatives were requested to 
se nd organizational materials for 
review and research into the best 
method to organize. Contacts at 
the State level, specifically in the 
Office of Consumer Affairs, will 
provide the invaluable in-roads 
into state agencies to facilitate 
the construction . Important to 
say, over and over, student 
apathy and general ignorance 
has prevented the utilizaiton of 
these resources and the 
realization of this project. But it's 
clear that the more students hear 
about this project, the more 
enthusiastic they become. 

In pursuing their vision in 
1979, students first went th rough 
the standard administra tive 
channels. They talked to the 
main man in the office of 
architects and engineers, Chuck 
Powers, who is stlll doing 
phenomenal amounts of work. 
He gave them a list of necessary 
steps that would pave the way 
for construction of an on-campus 
Geodesic Dome which would be 
cooperatively run. Unfortunately, 
his method involved professional 
commitment. something he gets 
paid quite well for. Students lack 

these resources , which is why 
they are students and not 
administrative profeSSionals. The 
congested administrative 
channels , which are accepted 
aline 1"S'lI given on this 
campus, are now blocking the 
student mandate. 

With this referendum, 
students are pOinting out their 
need for creating their own 
environment and running it the 
way they see fit. They can ask 
the administration to do it, using 
sutdents' money, or they can do 
it themselves, for themselves. An 
example of the fonner method is 
now underway with the 
University Center, where 
students plan its purpose under 
the guidance and will of the 
administration. There is no 
example of the laner at UCSD, 
yet there is student initiative. 
There is a coherent student will , 
it just isn't coherently directed . 

The realities of student 
distraction have made any 
student initiative easy prey to 
contrary administrative agendas. 
Issues pop up and disappear 
with agonizing regularity; 
students sufferi ng from short 
memories, and the 
administration capitalizing on 
this transience . For students to 
gain the long-tenn benefits of 
coop housing and to even get 
the buildings constructed, it 
requires the organization of all 
intersted students into a non-
profit corporation that is also an 
official student organization -
possessing both a chatter and 
by-laws for both distinctions. 

Admininstrative interests, 
which need to see student 
service as businessess and see 
research as marketable , have not 
felt a directed student will for 

years. The issue of cooperative 
housing has the power to cohere 
students around a specific issue , 
to further combine their will and 
direct it in the interests of 
students. This vision of student 
power has precedents, many 
precedents, both here and at 
other schools. It comes not from 
elected officers of associated 
student councils, also it isn't 
found entirely in sympathetiC 
administrators who are important 
too, but is found in the students' 
own willingness to participate, to 
educate themselves, to go outside 
the requirements of their majors , 
and make their opinions and 
vision known . Student power is 
YOU ! 

Housing cooperative are 
businesses incorporated as stock 
companies where 
members/ residents own shares. 
Members vote according to the 
prinCiple: one member, one vote. 
The stock companies (i.e. the 
associated students) own the 
hOUSing and members elect a 
board of directors to manage the 
property. Each member agrees to 
pay a monthly housing cost, with 
no landlords! The benefits to 
housing cooperatives are many, 
accrued to both student 
consumer/ residents and to the 
University community as a 
whole. 

However, coop housing in its 
synergestic definition also 
derives benefits for the univerSity 
community which are best 
exemplified by Berkeley's 
Cooperative Association . 

Its primary purposes are: 
e To promote the social and 
general welfare of the 
community by offering low-
rent hOUSing to all university 
students, regardless of race, 

Monday, January 6, 1986 7 
OPINIONS 

creed, color, or national 
origin, and thus influence the 
community to eliminate 
prejudice and discrimination 
in housing. 
eTo advance the cause of 
education by proViding 
inexpensive board and 
lodging for university students 
with limited resources, so that 
those who might nOt 
otherwise be able to continue 
at the Universtiy because of 
economic need, may enjoy the 
fruits and benefits of higher 
education. 
eTo relieve the government of 
the State of California from 
the burden of building and 
operating state-owned 
donnitories by creating 
housing facilities for students 
at low cost on a cooperative 
basis: and to continually 
expand and extend those 
facilities in the community 
interest. 
eTo engage in a continuous 
educational program designed 
to eliminate prejudice and 
discrimination in housing, 
and to further the principles 
of tolerance and cooperation 
through mutual, self-help 
living at minimal cost. 

These purposes are currently 
utilized by the largest cooperative 
housing association in the UC 
system, and represent an ideal 
for UCSD's future . Let me close 
with a plea for your 
participation ; tomorrow and 
beyond I guarantee long hours of 
thankless work and frustrations, 
but the payoff - the payoff is a 
rare sense of satisfaction which 
can only be characterized as the 
"satisfaction of cooperation." Ask 
anyone who knows', there is no 
turning away afterwards. ~

AS considers ceiling for media funds 
AlTERNATIVE MEDlA BUDGET PROCESS PROPOSA1.5 

I. Introduction 
In the past the media budget process was characterized by 

lengthy, ,bitter confrontations between the AS. and the 
alternative media at UCSD. The process, aside from being 
tedious and laborious, was always met with ciriticism 
regarding its subjectivity and fairness. Paratially due to this, 
as well as due to factors outlined below, this office feels a 
need for change is In order, 

The following is a package oudining the mode of thinking 
behind the proposal in front of you. Its foundation lies in 
the unquestionable nted for fairness , equity, and 
responsibility, amongst all altemative media. A guideline in 
the writing of this proposal is the objective of accumulat ing 
as many diverse viewpoints at UCSD as possible. At present 
this is not the case. 

Finally, fiscal restricitons demand that a change is 
implemented. It is Imperative that the ASUCSD represent the 
student body's interests, and require responsible use of 
<;(udent money by various organizations. A measurable return 
must be persued in the interst of responsibility by all panics 
involved. 

This office realizes that the proposed change appears 
somewhat drastic, but it IS hoped that the picture as a whole 
is seen before forming an opinion. 
II. Historical Background 

I). Process: In the past a line-item budget was submitted 
by each alternative media. This was reviewed by the 
Media Board, and frequently adjusted to meet fiscal 
restrictions. as well as to reflect realistic needs on part of 
the alternative media. 
2). The individual budgets were combined into a si ngle 
Media Budget, brought to A.S. Council, and decided on. 
3). Publications &: Size: At present the ASUCSD, through 
student funds, subsidizes and suppons 9 different 
alternative medias. These range in appropriations 
between roughly 512,000 [or the New Indicator to $844 
for the California Review. They publish between one to 
four times each quarter. At present no publishing 
schedule or deadlmes are required by the ASUCSD. No 
editorial input (even though it could legally be made) is 
exercised by the ASUCSD. Editors have total control and 
freedom in runntng their individual papers. Only in the 
last year has income (via advertising sales) been required . 

Ill. Reasons [or Change 

manual was funded from General Unallocated). 
2). There is at present no room for growth (i.e . additional 
media). At present there is no available money to fund 
prospective new papers such as the "La Jolla Forum". 
3). At present there is no measurable return to students; 
the invested money is almost totally student funds and 
not from medias own contributions. 
4). Equity has to be attained and maintained amongst all 
media. 
5). Media have to fight amongst themselves for funding, 
instead of supponing each other's diverse viewpoints. 

This year the Media Budget obtained unprecedented levels 
of money, yet it was not possible to fund all of the existing 
papers even with this dramatic increase in overall funding. 
There is at present no money left in the Media Unallocated 
account, so that while the intent to foster new viewpoints 
may exist, realistically this is impossible. Continued support 
of the medias as it stands will not be possible due to fiscal 
restrictlon , and only by moving towards greater financial 
independence can the continlled growth and existence of 
alternative media at UCSD be supported. Such a move would 
also exemphfy the dedication and committment to their 
respective viewpoints by the individual papers. The follOWing 
proposal is one that rises OUI of necessity, but has the 
intention to strengthen and foster the diverser vlewpomts 
already in existence at UCSD. To be gUided by a belief that 
the flow of funding is endless and will contmue to increase 
can only be looked at as a tOtal misconception. It will not be 
the case. The alternative media as a whole must take the 
mitial step towards ensuring a sound future at UCSD. The 
present system is unequalled within the UC group, but 
change, foresight, and planning is needed now to secure the 
continued, strong existence of alternative media at UCSD. 
IV. 3-Year Plan Proposal 

The following is a proposal geared towards all tabloids 
funded by the ASUCSD. Its intent is to bring all media to an 
equal level of support by student fees. This is to be done by 
lowering! raismg the respective allocations until an equitable 
level IS attained by all . 

Part A: General GlIidelines 
I ). All media shall be funded up to a level of $4000.00. 
2). This allocation shall cover production costs of six (6 ) 
issues during the course of the year (2 Issues each 
quarter), as well as production costs associated with 
running a newspaper. 

4). 'Color, special projects, and special fonna[ting shall be 
paid for by income obtained by individual medias. 
5). Each media wiD be responsible for providing a 
publication schedule at the beginning of each quarter. 
6). Each media is free to extend and/or expand their 
publication wihtin the rules as provided by the Media 
Charter, with funding coming from internal sources, such 
as advenising revenues. 
7). Non-compliance with any of [he above anicirs shall 
result in the review o[ the particular media by the Media 
Board, and can ultimately cause the freezing or 
reallocation of the panicular budget. 

Pan B: New Medias 
1). Prospective new medias shall, upon review by the 
Media Board, be funded up to 52500.00 the first year. 
This is to cover costs for one issue per quaner for three 
quarters. 
2). Instatemem of a new media to full fundmg shall be 
pOSSible in their second full year of existence, and shall 
come under review of the Media Board. 
3). All medias, and their policies, shall come into 
quarterly review by the Media Board . Failure [0 comply 
with existing bylaws can result in freezing and/ or 
reallocation of a media's budget. 

Part C: Existing Medias 
I ). Existing medias have the option to publish less than 
six ( 6) times a year. Funding, as reViewed by the Media 
Board, shall reflect this. 
2). Media presently recieving fundmg In excess of 
$4000.00 shall, over a period of 3 years, have this excess 
reallocated to Media Unallocated. This process shall take 
place in 3 equal installment payments. 

l.a Voz present allocation is 

$1 ,700.0013 - $566.66 

$5,700.00 
-4,000.00 

1,70000 

Allocation in year I - $5,133.34 
Allocation in year 2 - $4,566.68 
Allocation in year 3 - $4,000.00 

3). The reverse process shall be use to bring up the 
desired level all medias receiving funding below 
$4000.00. I). Budget process is not efficient since it appropriated 

media money from different sources. (Disorientation 3). COSt shall reflect usage of newsprint paper; black ink only; 10 halftones per issue; 12 page issues and delivery. 4 ). This policy shall come into effect startinJ1, with the Please tum to page 24

there is a problem, but we'd like 
to add our own ideas - but 
Fahlbusch has already set the 
agenda." 

the proposal could create a 
lOgjam of journals whIch would 
funhcr increase the strain on the 
media budget Fahlbusch agrees 
that th e appearance o( ten new 
journals would create a problem 
with the plan , but feels that this 
situation is unlikely to arise . "I've 
been here three years , and only 
one new media (Alternative 
Visions) is getting money." 

(2) surveying studem readershIp 
of the journals and (3) seeking 
advice from some of the 
communication experts on 
campus. 

"Ken Carriffe (last year's 
communications commissioner) 
tried to conduc t a survey and it 
proved to be a horrible failure . A 
good scientific survey could cost 
thousands of dollars to 
implement, and we just don't 
have the money," Fahlbusch 
said, "besides, the plan is not 
etched in stone - Mary Rose 
and , are going to suggest that 

an ad consultant be hired in 
order to facilitate raising funds 
In some equitable manner, for 
instance."

student referendum now. 
Fahlbusch said that he did not 
want to wait for [he elections to 
put his proposal on the baUot 
because '" want to get something 
done now. We have some 
budgetary problems involving the 
typesetter and new journals (the 
proposed La Jolla Forum), and I 
wanted input immediately." 

media feel that a "long-term, 
coherent counterproposal" will 
take longer than the time allotted 
to develop. Fahlbusch comends 
that the time period IS not 
concrete. "I'm willing to wait [WO, 
three more weeks, as long as 
there is some concrete work 
being done. , will not wait 
indefinitely, however." 

"The proposal is iU-conceived 
and doesn't really address the 
problems of the media ," said 
Mathew Mayer of the Birdcage 
Review. 

"We've listed our complaints 
against the proposal this issue, 
and we'll do whatever is 
necessary to defeat it," said 
Epperly, "even if it involves a

1964: Changes, from motel-living to donns 
By DAWN WAIT. Staff Writer 

Twenty-one years ago last 
September, UCSD enrolled its 
first undergraduate students. The 
181 freshman constituted the 
class of 1968 at Revelle College, 
the first of the four existing 
UCSD campuses. 

John Stewan, provOSt of Muir 
College, staned his career at 
UCSD during these early years m 
1964. UCSD's Chancellor York 
contacted Stewan, who had been 
professor of Engl ish at 
Danmouth College fo r IS years. 
and a ked him to design a flOe 
arts program for the unlversll} 

I had been workmg at the 
Hopkm~ Center [or Ans at 
Danmourh smce 1900," Stewan 
explamed'RO\ Pearce, who wa~ 
on the fa ul t\ at UCSD. \\a~ ,U1 
old fnend 01 mme from OhIO 
~l,1tc where we \\ae offIce mates 
lie 'new .Ihout m) work in the 
,m~ at Danmouth and suggested 
th,l( I could d(,~lgn an an~ 
program for LCSD " 

lohn (,albrallh, the Incoming 
chancellor, liked Stewart's Ideas 
for the propo ed ans program 
for the university and asked 
Stewan to join the staff. 

It was an opponunl ty I 
couldn't pass up," Stewan saId . 

After Stewart settled in he was 
asked to be provost of Second 
College, now known as MUir. "I 
never anticipated I would be 
asked to be a ProVOSt: said a 
smiling Stewan. 

"I asked five of my friends to 
meet at my house. We would sit 
around and talk about our 
utopian ideals of a college while 
listening to chamber music. 
Gradually we put together a 
CUrriculum," Stewart says, 

Since the univerSity lacked a 
full faculty , Stewan also chaired 
several of the depanments, like 
drama and music m addition to 

John Stewart, MUIr Provost - "We would ralk about our utopian ideals 
of a college while listening to chamber music. Gradually we put together 
the curriculum ... 

heading the new arts 
depanment. 

The university 'S faculty was 
quickly changing during 1964. In 
September Dr. Roger Revelle . 
lounder of UCSD, resigned a.d 
accepted the directorship of 
Harvard 's Center for Population 

Studies. Chancellor Herbert York 
reSigned for health reasons and 
John Galbraith replaced him in 
December of 1964. 

Although they left the 
university, both Revelle and York 
kept in close contact and both 
eventually returned. York 

resumed his position as 
chancellor from 1970 to 1972 
and Revelle returned to UCSD as 
a professor emeritus after he 
retired from Harvard in the late 
seventies. 

"We are so fortunate that they 
(York and Revelle) kept close 
contact," remarks Stewan. "Roger 
Revelle made my work easier .. . 
he was very, very supportive of 
having strong programs in the 
arts " 

DespHe these changes, UCSD's 
fIrst undergraduates arn ved in 
the fall of 1964. They took 
clas~es in Ute} Hall, the school's 
first lompleted bUIlding. tewan 
explained that \1ayer Hall was 
also huilt , hut nOl read} for use 
"Ure)' Hall was tilt' huddlng . all 
the dassrnoms, the lJilices .lOd 
the hhr,lT) were In that hUlldlng. 

Beeau e no dorms or 
,lpanmCnt5 were built vet 
.,tudents had to 11 \ ,(' In' facliltles 
ll fl call1pu~ 

'Students stayed at the La Jolla 
Shores MOIel for the firs t 
qua rter," saId Ted Forbes, who 
was Dean of tudents In 1964. 

Although the accomodatlons 
were inconvenient Forbes said 
'The students dld~ 't seem to ' 
mind that much , in fact they had 
fun stayi ng at the motel. I 
remember one student replaced 
the "S" in Shores on the motel 
sign with a 'W for a joke. 
(SpeDing La Jolla Whores Motel). 
The motel owners didn't like that 
very much." 

By the second quarter of the 
1964-65 school year, students 
were able to move into residence 
halls on ReveDe. 

Although the students finaDy 
received on-campus hOUSing, 
they yet lacked bus service to or 
from campus. Forbes, who was 

in the Depanment of Physical 
Education recalled , "We hired a 
bus for a minimal expense to go 
to Torrey Pines Inn where we 
held swimming classes." 

Recreation on campus was 
abundant, but only because 
students improvised and the 
Education Depanment fixed -up a 
recreation field on Mathews 
Campus. "We created a gym out 
of one of the buildings left from 
Camp Mathew!>," explains 
Forbes. tudents voluntanly 
signcd up for SpOrts: int ramural 
flag foot hall and sand volleyball 
were very popular We've had a 
(anti! tiC turn-out from the very 
fIrst day," sa id Forbes. 

The hrsttudent puhhcatlon , 
the "Newsletter " and a ,tudent 
organization were stanrd in 
1964 The organIzation designed 
J swdent constttutlon, which 
wa~ appnwed by the faculty, 
which mcluded an honor code 
but that only 1.l5ted one quaner' 
Forbes commented, "The honor 
code started out ,) kind of a 
dream, but It Just didn 't work 
our." 

The MUIr Special Project, 
another addition started by 
Stewart. began In '64 and 
continues to this day, with an 
average of ten students a quarter. 
"These are fascinating projects," 
says Stewart. "One of the first 
projects done was one where a 
young man studied seals in the 
Antarctic for one month, and 
went to the Arctic for six weeks 
after that." 

Stewan also initiated two other 
programs: the Muir/Dartmouth 
exchange and the Chicano 
Studies Project. Both started 
duri ng the 1968-69 school year.

1966: Library, sports, housing stir opinions 
By GLENN CRESWELL 

Th~ first undergraduate class 
began their long haul th rough a 
new but qua.lity university system 
in 1964 and later in 1966, UCSD 
continued to forge ahead with 
dramatic changes in the 
appearance of the campus, and 
the students. A professor of 
history transferred from UCLA to 
assume the position of UCSD 
Chancellor from November of 
1964 through August of 1968. Dr. 
John Galbraith , remembers those 
changes weD, as his foreSight 
and dedication LO the 
educational system were 
responsible for many of them. 

Galbraith himself was facing 
some possible changes in 
February of that year \ :Ien he 
and Vice Chancellor Raben 
Byron submitted their intent to 
resign w the Board of Regents. 
"The approximare cause of that," 
Galnaim recaDs, "was that we 
had proposed plans Cor Central 
LiIDIy and Cor rhe boundaries 
oa_ medliral school, ~ 
,.... aJIf covts",k=ion wirh 
me, tbe a~bi(!isuation at 
Berkdq" lit t1IlM!d these two 

~ms from the agenda .. 
Galbraith ~ys he W;Jsn'( 

disturbed about thIS setback, as 

Central Library was under 
construction by 1968. 

The library Qroiect was one 
of Galbraith's objectives in 
creatine a credible academic 
institution of UCSD. "The 
campus staned Out," Galbraith 

John Galbraith 
UCSD's second chancdlor 

expla llled , "WIth a great 
emphaSIS on the phY!>lcal and 
biologIcal s<.'Iences." AccordIng to 
Galbmlth there were (Ir~t d.tss 

professors at UCSD in physics, 
chemistry , biology and applied 
chemistry. "One of the 
necessities during my tenure," he 
reflected , "was to develop special 
departments primarily in the 
humanIti es such as history, 

SOCiology and anthropology." 
With the help of John Stewart, 

the provost at that time, 
Galbranh expanded U D In to 
the fine ilrts humanitIes and 
SOCIal 'o(lences But somclhlllg 

was needed to attract first-class 
people into [hose areas. "In the 
case of humanities," he 
explained, "this is particularly 
difficult if the library is not first 
class." 

Other pans of campus were 

changing face as well. Early in 
the year, $2 million wa allocated 
for con!>ITUction of three new 
dorm ltOrlc!> <\1ld $40 mill IOn se t 
off the pl.tns 101 Ihe schnol of 
medICine Abo dUring thIS t1m~ 

the administration complex was 
being moved to Camp Mathews, 
and according to Galbraith , "The. 
ground breaking was in 1966 for 
the basic science building and 
medical school." The most talked 
about structure, however, was the 
future Central Library which was 
being designed in 1966 as 
sketches of the "space-ship· 
could be found all over the La 
Jolla newspapers. 

So as not to be lost in the din 
of construction, the students at 
UCSD were finding much to be 
verbal about. While the ink on 
Galbraith's reSignation was still 
wet, a revolt had begun over the 
unfairness of the restrictions 
placed on visiting privileges in 
the residence haDs. Students 
were being aDowed the hours 
between 2 ~nd 5 pm Cor personal 
room visitations d uring the week 
with an extra hour on the 
weekends. "I think that revolt 
was largely a result of a fa ilure in 
communications," says Galbraith. 
"Obviously, there was a 
breakdown here between the 
adminIstration and the students."

quarter? 

Many students complain about 
the high prices and long hnes at 
the UCSD Book Store , but 
according to Paul Mare , general 
manager of the Book Store , it's 
"lower than average among other 
book stores on the West Coast." 
Countering this statement by 
Mares are the results of a survey 
conducted last year by the 
Associated Students. The most 
glaring difference in price on a 
single book was found to be 
close to $10.00 on Chemical 
Principles, 4th edition, by 
Dickerson. Whereas the UCLA 
Book Store seDs t'lis edition for 
$27.95, th e pric UCSD charged 
at the time of the survey was 
$37.75! 

Since last year, however, the 
UCSD Bookstore has "lowered its 
prices in response to the ill will 
high prices create," said Mares. 
The price we pay includes a 3-
10% markup over the suggested 
retail price set by the publisher. 

In response then, to the high 
prices of the UCSD Bookstore , 
KB Books was founded . Its main 
goals are to "make buying books 
less of a hassle and [0 bring 
competition into the market," 
said Ken Appel , one of the 
original founders of this student-
run enterprise . 

Located in the back of the 
Good Eanh Vitamin store in La 
Jolla Village Square and open the 
first month of every quaner, KB 
Books IS run by students who are 
interested in helping other 
students avoid the long lines, the 
"di scouneous service and the 
unreasonable return policy of the 
UCSD Book Store," Appel said . 

All textbooks ordered from the 
publisher are automatically 
discounted 20 percent from the 
suggested retail price, if not 
more, when a book Slore places 
an order. In the past few years , 
freight COStS from the East Coast 
(where most of the publishers 
are located) to the West Coast 
have increased drasticaDy. Oust 
think how much more it costs to 
send a lener.) Depending on the 
book store, and [he profit 
deSired, the mark-up will be 
anywhere from 30 percent (10% 
over the suggested retail price) at 
the UCSD Book Store, to 20 
percent at Groundworks, to 18 
percent at KB Books. All in all , a

mark up between 18 and 23 
percent seems standard. 

A way to counter the 
sometimes unaffordable COSt of 
ncw books, however, is to check 
the supply of used books at the 
UCSD Book Store , KB Books and 
Revelle Bargain Books. Although 
the pri ce of a used book varies 
accordmg to demand for the 
book, a 50 percent return on the 
onglnal suggested retail price is 
ave rage , regardless of whether or 
not the book will be used the 
next quarter. KB Books buys 
books back for a "little more than 
50 percent, and then sells them 
for a little less than 75 percent of 
the new retail price," said Appel. 

The UCSD Book Store, 
however has a set policy of 
paying "half of the new retail 
price to students selling books 
back and then selling the books 
at 75 percent of the retail value," 
said Mares. 

For those interested in more 
of a return, Revelle Bargain 
Books offers that option. They 
sell used books on conSignment 
£rom students. While suggesting 
a 50 percent mark-down from 
the original price, books in high 
demand may be priced at up to 
75 percent of the original price. 
Revelle Bargain Books then adds 
on 15 percent of the price asked 
for itself. If the book sells, the

An additional advantage of 
Revelle Bargain Books is that 
they will buy back books at any 
time during the quarter. 

In this way, according to Steve 
Howard, a Revelle Bargain Books 
work-study employee, students 
have the option to "buy books 
cheaper," as well as "sell them 
back and make more money." 

When buying books this 
quarter, you may also want to 
check the other book stores 
catering to UCSD students. 
Although KB Books has a smaller 

inventory than rhe UCSD Book

textbooks for the larger, more

for language, literature, history,

Galbraith described another

anticipated." 

Galbraith expressed his 
distaste for ultimatums and in 
general , his dislike for the way 
the students handled the entire 
incident. "The issue was not: he 
explained. "whether it was 
deSIrable to change the rules but

students took place 'n sympathy 
wah the Berkeley stullI'm \I ho 
were striking over policy 
disagreements, silent rallIes and 
occasIonal marches by banner-
waving students were held on 
Revelle' Plaza . These protests, 
according to Galbraith, were 
relatively mild in comparison to 
UCB, but, they didn't remain 
sympathy protests for long. "It 
started off that way, but by the 
middle 60's, they had moved to 
an emphasis on campus protests 
of Viemam. It was no longer a 
free speech emphasis." 

The war in Vietnam had other 
effects. "It affected the campus 
vely greatly," Galbraith explained , 
"in terms of such manifestations 
as change of dress. When these 
students came m, the boys were 
wearing short hair and girls were 
wearing dresses. By '65 Qr '66 
there wa~ a great change in hair 
style and c10thmg styles. The 
dentms had to be hlea(hed " 
GalbraIth sa}'s thai the dramatic 
change in appearance was part 
of a national phenom non that 
the students tried to be a pan of. 
Some students formed a "fairly 
aCtIve" branch of a nanon-wide 
organization called 'Students for 
a Democratic Society' (SDS) 
which opposed the war and 
protested companies hke DOW 
Chemical and military recruiters 
on campus. 

Pursuit of SpOrt and social life 
offset the antagonism caused by 
the protests. November of 1966 
saw the groundbreaking for the 
gymnasium and natatorium, and 
a growing intramural sports 
program. It was decided early in 
UCSD's history that athletic 
scholarships would not be 
offered so as to preserve an 
academic environment, but 
maximum paIticipation would be 
stressed in the intramural 
activitIes. 'There was 
considerable faculty opposition," 
GalbraIth remembered, "to 
having the semi-pro athletics. 
There were a couple of members 
from our literature department 
who came from Ohio State who 
didn't want to have confusion 
out here." 

LaJolJa was not waiting with 
open arms to welcome the 
university on the mesa in its 
beginning and so had very litde 
to offer students in the way of 
social living. Students 
complaIned about having very 
little to do but study. "This 
campus was regarded by some 
students as being a 'drudge 
campus,'" re members Galbraith . 
"There wasn't as much initiative, 
as there might have been on the 
part of the students to do some 
things for themselves. It was 
possible to organize and get 
some of these ame nities." 

In hopes of improving the 
social climate at UCSD, Galbraith

she got back on her feet. 

Another situation the ProVOSt 
recalled was one where a young 
man had financial problems 
because he would not take 
money from his parents. "This 
student was trying to break free 
from his family, who wanted him 
to be a doctor or something ... 
he wanted to go into 
oceanography. Since he didn) 
have any money, he lived in a 
cave in Torrey Pines Park and 
pIcked through the garbage can 
for his meals." [n this situation , 
Stewart intervened between the 
student and his family "His 
parents eventually let up ," he 
said. 

When Muir College enrolled 
its first undergraduates in 1967, 
they were housed at Mathews 
campus, now Warren. In 1970 
Muir's campus was moved to its 
current location. Stewart recalled, 
"The students didn't like moving 
from the landscaped Mathews to 
the barren Muir campus." 

Stewart recaUed the faculty'S 
surprise when undergraduate 
enrollment exceeded the 
graduate enrollment: ·Originally 
we planned on having many 
more graduate students than 
undergraduates ," He adds, "We 
planned only one large lecture 
hall, which turned Out to be a 
problem with the number of 
undergraduates who enrolled." ~

course, not plowing into the car 
ahead of you or getting plowed 
into from behind. We've aD 
heard about those atrocious San 
Joaquin Valley accidents where 
52 cars pile together one after 
another like so many dominoes, 
and 18 people are killed and 135 
others seriously injured. Hen, the 
measly litde ten-ca~ pile-ups 
don't even make the news any 
more. 

"Avoid a pile-up. Get out of 
this alive." That's aU we thought 
about as we drove. You'll be 
drivi ng along, and the fog hits 
- boom! - and there you are. 
The cars in front of you are 
gone, the cars behind you are 
gone . It's ridiculous to keep 
going 60 miles an hour in this 
Sluff, but if you slow down so 
much that you can actually see 
where you're going, you'D soon 
be attached in a permanent way 
to the front end of the semi 
behind you. 

You have to come up with a 
plan. Fi nd a pace car, and don't 
let go. As long as the car ahead 
of you doesn't run into anything, 
you shouldn't either. So you get 
behind a car, and as long as you 
can keep a reasonable distance 
behind it without losing it, you're 
fine. T hat car follows another 
car, that one follows still another 
car, and so on. Theoretically, at 
the beginning of this chain is 
someone on the other side of the 
fog bank. Or maybe it's just some 
poor slob who isn't smart enough 
10 get behind someone, or who 
thinks that there's nothing to 

worry about, that seeing where 
you're going isn't July aI that 
big of a deal, that since there 
isn't anythinJ in the=that isn't 
Ptcre nonnally you . as well 
go along at a normal . or 70. 
It's a scary thought 10 think that

taiDights. Two little red dots in

staring at twO red blips ahead of 
you - not daring 10 blink, not 
daring to breathe. Then the fog 
suddenly gets denser, and the 
dots dim and dim - and 
disappear! ' Oh (swear word)! 
Now what?!" Stay calm. slow 
down a little. Say a few Hail 
Marys. Is that a truck about to 
barrel inlO us at 70 miles an 
houri?! No, it's just some lint on 
the rear view mirror. Are those 
brake lights ahead?! Is that a 
pile-up?! Are those bodies on the 
side of the road? No, you're 
hallucinating. You're fine.Just 
meDow Ollt 

From out of nowhere some 
jackass speeds by you in the left 
lane. I don't understand how 
these people dri~ like that.. Talk 
about a 52-car pile-up waiting to 
happen - there it goes in the 
left lane. As much as I wanted a 
pace car, 1 just couldn't gel the 
nerve to get behind these guys 
and go as fast as ~y did, and 

so the twO red docs they 
provided would disappear into 
the distance. 

To make the Irip jusl • little 
I1IOI'E aciting. as if it wasn't 
aImIdy (and it was), the car we 
were driving had some kind of 
alipncnt or suspension problem 
and handled horridly. 10 that

bodt ~nt through ~ral pairs 
of underwear, and I had such a 
tight grip on the steering wheel 
that I thought my fmgers would 
nev.:r srraighten out again. 

That was the most nerve-
wracking drive of my life. The 
fog was thick through most of 
California's Central Valey and 
much of Oregon as wen. How 
commuters in these areas survi~ 
during the foggy season, I don't 
know. Some don't, 1 guess. 

We survived, of course, but 
that was a scary ride. We actuaDy 
saw a rile-up on the opposite 
side 0 the freeway somewhere 
in Cenrral California. It was an 
almost unreal sight - out of 
nowhere appeared whirling red 
and blue lights as about five fire 
engines and se~ral other 
emergency vehicles clamored 
around some accident that we 
couldn't see and didn't reaDy 
want 10 see. 

That's what I did during my

La..] aHa Classic starts Friday_ 

X-mas brings .500 tidings to cagers 
By MAIT lAII, Staff Writtr 
A week after Christmas, 
And all through the gym 
Basketball playoff hopes, 
Look rather dim. 
20 foot jump shots 
Hung in the air, 
And some oj the Tritons 
just didn 't care. 
Visons oj going home 
Danced in their head 
And some oj the games 
They lost when they led. 
Vacation is oyer 
A New Year begun 
The Tritons are ready 
To run and to gun . 
The players and coaches 
Have reached the conclu ion 
That winning theIr ga mes 
Is the Year's resolution. 

YES, it appears as if San ta Claus didn't get Coach Marshall 's wish for a 
7-foot-7-inch Manute Bol. 

The Tritons went 4-4 during 
the vacation makmg their record 
6-6 overall . 

Just before finals , UCSD 
played and lost a hard tought 
battle against USIU 107-112. 
Even though Marshall believed 
before the game his team would 
beat the Division I school, he felt 
they had "nothing to be ashamed 
of," desp ite the fact that they 

·committed key fouls and made 
some crucial mistakes." The teams 
will meet again later in the year. 

The next night the '1 ritons 
beat La Verne 89-80 in a yawner. 

"We were extremely fIat , 
mainly because we were totally 
annihilated and debilitated by 
the night before . Lucky for us 
our schedule was such that we 
played a very weak team ," 
Marshall said. 

On the last day of finals the 
Tritons beat Claremont Mudd 
99-94 in a game that wasn't as 
close as the score indicates. 
UCSD played well except for 
their defense, which Marshall 
admits "is still a little weak. " 

To start the holidays o ff in a 
bad d irection , th e Tritons lost to 
Whittier 109-85. Wi th W h ittier 
shooting 70 percent from the 
field and 92 percent from the 
line , it's hard to blame the team 
for losing. What could they do? 
Marshall said , "They had a 
'V~llonova fimsh ' type game. We 
had a sluggish type of game. It's 
expected with the residual effect 
of finals ... the team was feeling 
a li ttle burned Out." 

The Tritons then bounced 
back to beat the Master's College 
84-80 in double ovenime. 
Marshall felt that this was 

another game that was closer 
than it should have been. We 
didn't "get the help from the 
bench that we could have ." 

UCSD then took second place 
in the Stanislaus Tournament. 
The Tritons beat Notre Dame in 
the first round, in overtime , 74-
72, but lost the finals to the 
tournament host, Stanislaus, 53-
51 , on a last second prayer. 

Greg Kamansky and Brian 
Backens received All-Tournament 
honors. In addition to the 
exceptional play of these two 
starters, Andy Jedynak and Mark 
Sutherlin "have been putting in 
very quality time," according to 
coach Marshall . 

Marshall believes this team, 
with seven freshmen and three 
transfers, still needs to "get 
together." Marshall has tough 
prdctices planned to "get back 
the conditloning and lose the 
bad habits that they have p icked 
up along the way." His New 
Year's resolution is "To have a 
defense whic h is really going to 
surprise people." 

The next fi ve games are at 
home with: Fresno Paci fi c, 
Trini ty University and the La 
Jolla ClaSSIC. The "Dash for 
Cash" will be fea tured at halftime 
during the latter two games. ~

The Best-and worst-of '85 
We live in an era where physical firness reigns 

supreme. With celebrities like Sylvester SIaIIone and 
Jane Fonda serving as role mo<kls, men and women 
alike work their muscles to their very limits. 
sculpting their bodies iOlo Adonis-like structures-
every muscle finely chiseled into rock-hard puffs. 

Well , for those of us on the other end of the 
scale, where fat seems to cling on the body like wet 
sand, 1985 was the year we found our inspiralion. 
Why? Because it was "The Year of the Fridge.-

Yes. WiUiam Perry, the J08 .,. defensive lineman 
and pan-tirne running back for the Chicago Bears 
provided the biggest story in 1985, but there were 
also many other newsworthy ~ in the ever-so-
wide world of spons, so we here at Wire-IO-Wire 
would like to take you on a IinIr ~ thfOUlth the 
obUptory and dreaded )ar in mliew' we wiIf 
chrisl£n "The Best, So-So, and Worst of 1985.-
THE ATHlETE MOST DfSEIMNG OF 
PUJUOIY BECAUSE OF SIZE: Wiliam "the 
Rdri&erator" Perry - thanb to Mike Ditka, head 
coadi of me Chicago Bears, dtc Fridge has been 
the most refreshing thing to happen to professional 
sportS since the Detroit Tigers had a pilcher and 
nUl named Mark "The Bird- Fidyrich, who endeared 
himself with the sporting public by talking ro the 
baseball before every pirch. Peny's presence on 
offense gives the heretofore anonymous linemen the 
chance to vicariously live the dream of touching the 
ball. Though the commercialization of the 
Refrigerator may cause some to become weary of 
this novelty. for many William Peny has shown that 
round is financially sound. as well as fun . 
THE ATHlETE LEAST DESERVING OF 
PUBUCITY BECAUSE OF SIZE: Terry Forster, relief 
pitcher for the Atlanta Braves - When David 
Letterman caDed Forster -a silo on the mound" and 
"a tub of goo·, no one could have expected the 
media attention that these few words wouldmgger. 
Possessing more tires on his body than an eighteen 
wheel rig, Forster gave new meaning to the term 
"athletic phYSique." ,A change of hean - and the 
fear of a c~d one - caused him to check mto a

Auerbach's droopy face after the game - minus the 
vicrory cigar. 
THE MR. HUMIUlY AWARD: Larry (I Be the 
Champ) Holmes lost the IBF boxing tide to Michael 
Spinks and thus lost the chance to end hIS career 
undefeated as the legendary Rocky Marciano did in 
the '50s. Holmes exemplified the true sportsman 
that he was by saying: "Rocky Marciano couldn't 
cany my jockstrap." Like a real man , Holmes waited 
tiD Marciano was dead to say this . 
THE MOST SPECT AClJIAR CATCH: Ahmad 
Rashad, the cool and suave co-host of NFL '85 on 
NBC looked like a withering blob on national 
television as he proposed LO the gorgeous Felicia 
Ayers-~n (Clare Huxtable of "The Cosby Show") 
on Thanksgiving Day, The "yes" that Felicia softly 
whispered from her mouth not only turned Rashad 
inw a Don Knons, but also made him the envy of 
miRions of men throughout the free world , Rashad 
made some pretty incredible catches as an All-Pro 
with the Minnesota Vikings, but this was definitely 
his most dazzling. 
THE WORST PERFORMANCE BY A FATHER-TO-
BE: John-John McEnroe is one of the greatest tennis 
players that ever lived . He also is one of the biggest 
morons that ever lived . He lives in Johnny Carson 's 
house, he's going out with Tatum O'Neal, and he 
expects ro be treated like John Q. Public . Tatum's 
rumored pregnancy wreaked havoc on Mc Enroe, as 
reporters at the Austrailian Open cared more about 
his play orr the court than on . After a couple of 
fights and denials of any rumors that Tatum was 
pregnant, he finally confessed to a Los Angeles 
Huald Express reponer that they were indeed 
expecting a child. Somehow, yo u gct the feehng that 
McEnroe must be getting some pointer from Sean 
Pp.nn. 
THE BIGGEST UPSET: The Villanova Wtldcats 
pulled orr what could arguably be the biggest upset 
in college basketball hislOry by defeating Patrick 
Ewing and the GeorgeLOwn Hoyas in the 
Championship game of the NCAA T ounament. The 
second half of the game was perfect execution of 
basketball strategy by Villanova as a slow white guy, 
Medowlark Lemon , and three no names were able 
to stun the basketball world . The real secret for 
upset though lies in the fact that Villanova coach 
Rollie Massimino is Italian. In 1983, North Carolina 
State Coach Jim Valvano, another Italian, pulled orr . 
an incredible upset of the "Phi Slamma Jamma" 
Houston Cougars prompting this exclusive Wire-to 
Wire prediction: St. John's, coached by Lou 
Camessecca, will beat North Carolina in the 1986 
NCAA Championship game. Remember, you heard 
it here first. 
THE BEST AU-AROUND SPORTSCASTERS: Bob 
Costas (NBC) and Chris Berman (ESPN). Costas, 
anchor of NFl.. '85, may need a booster seat to

deemphasize his stature, but that's all the boosting 
he's going to need as he is the heir apparent to 
Dick Enberg's position as the No. 1 guy. COSta's 
carefree and humor-filled approach to spons is the 
direct antithesis of the stodgy Cosell's . Bennan is 
the most e njoyable because o f his habit of 
christening n icknames on players, such as Ron 
(Bo rn in the U.S.) Cey and Mario (Scotch and) Soto. 
THE MOST EXCITING INNING OF THE YEAR: 
Bottom of the ninth , SIXth game of the World 
Series, SI. LOUIS vs. Kansas City. Sweden's most 
important expon to Kansas City, Dane lorg, hit the 
game winning hit to beat the Cardinals and aDow 
the Royals to get into the seventh game of the Series 
and eventua~ win it all, 
THE MOST BOISTEROUS UCSD CROWD: (not 
including a USB 2722 lecture) THE HEAD Game 
a.k.a . NCAA Western Regional Final versus the 
Claremont Mudd Stags (?). Throngs packed Warren 
Field , including the roofs and balconies of the 
Revelle Apartments, trying to get a glimpse of the 
historic victory against the hated Stags, who, had 
defeated UCSD in their previous two meetings. A 
close runner-up was the Women's Volleyball 
Regional Final against laVerne where the noise 
level caused Triton Pavillion to creak and sway, 
and where the Sun God mascot was upstaged by a 
WIld man named "Dabo." 

Go East, young man, go east. .. 
Rumor has it that San Diego is not a good 

basketball town . Cold hard facts suggest that San 
Diego IS to basketball what Lake Michigan is to 
surfing: noth ing. Yet given this town 's experience at 
the p ro level with the hapless Rocke ts, 
Conquistadors, Sails and Clippers at the p ro level, 
some feel the local population is justified in turning 
a cold shoulder toward the ma rvelous game of 
roundball 

The legacy of lOSing inherited by the C\i'p pers, 
thei r flaky owner and Peter Graham's imrigues with 
the city over the leaky sports a rena have left a bitte r 
taste in the mouths of San Diego's basketball 
commUnlty. Talk o f bringing a CBA franchise to Sa n 
Diego has dwindled , and the future of p ro hoop in 
San Diego is an open and very shut case. 

Unfo nunately. college ball has also suffered in 
San Diego, reflec tive o f a trend up and down the 
west coast. The c urrem state of the Aztecs at State 
belies the gains made by the Torrerros as USD, and 
the lack of attendance and community suppOrt for 
the teams strengthens the case of the naysayers who 
feel that no matter how good the product on the

reporters on a no-expenscs paid vacation and fact 
finding tour into the centcr of the hardwood 
heartland - North Carolina - to chronicle the 
differences. 

College basketball in North Caroli na is big - real 
big. It should be noted , however, that there is li ttle 
else happening in North Carolina - sponswlse or 
otherwise . With no pro franchises in any major 
sport, college and prep Sports re ign supreme. 
Nonetheless, college hoop in th is area has 
attendance figures, community support, and media 
coverage that easily exceeds college popularity on 
the west coast and rivals that of many pro 
franchises. College hoop in the east is aU business. 
Where else can you sce the North Carolina game 
against Chaminadc in Hawaii live? Begin ning at 
1:00 am in the morn ing? 

Although there are Carolina schools in other 
conferences, it is the Atlantic Coast Conference -
perhaps the best in the nation - that commands 
the most attent ion in North Carolina. Five of the 
ACe's eight teams were ranked in the top fony in 
The Sporting News' pre-season poll - including the 
number one, three and five p icks. By compari son, 
there is only one school fro m the enti re west coast 
in the top fony - Pepperdine came in at number 
34. 

North Carolina is home to four of the eight teams 
in the ACe. The number one ranked Tar Heels. 

number thrce Duke , the Nonh Carolina State 
Wolfpack and Wake Forest all call North Carolina 
home. Additionally, Virginia, Maryland , Clemson, 
and up-and-coming Georgia Tech compete in this 
powerful conference. 

The popularity of all these teams is due , in part, 
10 the intense rivalries inspired by their regional 
proximity. A visit to a local wa tering hole revealed 
the depth of the di ffere nt allegiances. Accordi ng to 
one Duke fa n, an intra-ACC game is like no other 
event in the Carolinas. "When Duke travels over to 
Chapel Hill 10 play the Ta r Heels in January, you 
can bet that half the student body'll be there with 
'em." Indeed, 10 play the Wolfpack in Raleigh , the 
Blue Devils of Duke can walk over to the game from 
their home in Durham. 'The enthusiasm is always 
so intense." said a Tar Heel fan , · 'cause eve n if your 
team isn't doin ' that well in the ACC that year, 
chances are their opponent is still one of the best 
teams in the nation ." Sellout audiences are the norm 
in the ACC , particularly in January when inter-
conference play begins. The locals themselves were 
at a loss to explain why the East has had so much 
success compared to the West. They scoffed at the 
attendance figures that the Holiday Classic rung up 
in San Diego. "tf a top team like Memphis State was 
playin' a team from the ACe. you can bet there'd be 
a lot more'n 3,000 folks in the stands," said one 
incredulous patron, "We do love our basketball 
down here." 

Of course the main reason for basketball 's success 
in the Tar Heel State and all over the East is the 
depth o f the pool of talent. Even though last year's 
conference was underclassmen heavy, the ACC still 
had 12 players taken in the NBA draft, more than 
anyone conference in the nation - including the 
big East - according to Doug Doughty of the 
Roanoke Times and World News. With the rise to 
power of the Big East conference - home to 
Georgetown, St. Joh n's, Syracuse and Villanova -
the well chronicled talent migration east may 
increase even funher. Recruitment wars are reaching 
new heights (depths?) among schools in the mid -
west and east, and talented prep players from the 
west coast can be sure of one thing when lhey 
graduate - the east and mid-west offcr better 
ve nues fo r their talents than anywhere west of the 
Rockies. 

Things may not actually be as bleak as they seem 
for the west coast schools. The Pac 10 is still the 
home of many great players, even though the overall 
depth of these schools in inferiror to those back 
east. San Frahcisco's retum to the WCAC bodes 
well for the west coast, and strong teams in • 
Pepperdine and localy at USD may help should a 
western backlash be in the near future. But until 
college basketball can generate the same fa naticism 
in the west that it does elsewhere, the vicious cycle 
of talent migration east is likely 10 continue.
