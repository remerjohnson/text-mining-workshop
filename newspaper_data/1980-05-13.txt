US-Mexican Studies 
Operate Nex.t Fall 

BY JANE GILBERT 
UCSD's US-Mexican 

Studies program win be in full 
operation next fall. The goals 
of the program include original 
research, training and public 
education of the full range of 
problems and i .. ues affecting 
US-Mexican relations. 

Key concerns will be 
immigration, trade, energy, 
foreign investment and 
technology transfer. 

In an effort to achieve these 
goals, the program will be 
.pon.oring re.earch and 
training fellowships for visiting 
.cholars and advanced 
graduate student. from 
Mexico and the United States. 
Public conferences, briefing 
session. for journali.ts who 
write for mass circulation 
publications and preparation 
of educational material. for 
use by public .chool. and 
community programs, and a 

.tudent exchange .ervice 
are also planned. . 

Wayne Cornelius, director 
of the program, feel. that 
undergraduate. will also 
benefit. Instead of passively 
attending lectures or 
consortiums, undergraduates' 
active participation is 
encouraged. Opportunities 
will be available for working as 
re.earch assistant. with 
vi.iting .cholars or with 
Cornelius. 

Undergraduates along with 
graduate .tudents are al.o 
invited to attend a year-long 
core seminar which will draw 
on faculty resources in several 
UCSD departments and from 
visiting professor •. 

Comeliu. emphasizes that 
the program i. "externally 
funded" and does not compete 
'with exi.ting UC programs. 

Testing Offered For 
Tay-Sachs Disease 

Gene Carriers Screened 
BY MARIA HANSEN 

seaff Writer 
Testing for Tay-Sachs 

disease, a fatal genetic 
disorder which affects 
children, is being held on 

~ all week at no charge 
to UCSD students, staff and 
the community. 

According to Scott 
Bernstein, student coordina· 
tor of the UCSD Tay-Sachs 
prevention program, "Ever~­
one on or oft campus .s 
encouraged to come in for a 
free screening." 

Tay-Sachs affects infanta 
and .mal children. "The 
child will appear perfectly 
nonnal, then, "r.dually the 

child will lose intelligence, go 
blind, deaf, .uffer from 
seizures and lose all musde 
coor~ination," Bernstein 
explains. 

'This deterioration progres-
ses until the child dies, a 
"vegetable" at age four or 
five. '~ere is no cure or 
treatment for Tay-Sachs," 
Bernstein stresses. 

However, Tay-Sachs can 
be detected in adult carriers, 
and the genetic disease can 
even be ICreened in the 
developing fetus.

Police Officer 
Charged with 
Store Theft 

BY JONATHAN KROLL 
A UCSD campus police 

officer was charged last 
Thursday morn in g with 
stealing cash from the 
Groundwork Bookstore , 
according to Kathe Vie-
brooks , spokeswoman for the 
Groundwork collective. 

Viebrooks ' released this 
official statement from the 
Groundwork Bookstore: "A 
member of the Groundwork 
Collective, Roberto Riley , 
hiding in the Groundwork 
Bookstore to find out who had 
been ripping off money, filed 
charges against a UC 
policeman at approximately 6 
am Thursday morning." 

Campus Police Chief Hugh 
French said a complaint has 
been made, but refused to 
release further information. 
He added that the theft is 
under investigation and hopes 
that it will be concluded by the 
end of the week. 

The bookstore, located in 
the Student Center, has been 
robbed repeatedly over the 
pas t year , according to 
Viebrooks. 

"Small but noticeable 
amounts, ranging from $5 to 
$25 have been getting ripped 
off," she said. 

As a result, the collective 
has tried to prevent the 
robberies, through a makeshift 
camera device , and by taking 
turns "staking out" the 
bookstore, according to 
Viebrooks. 

On the morning of May 8, 
collective member Riley had 
been sleeping under a couch,

US Seeks $1 Million 
For Tijuana Bridge 

From the Auociated Pre .. 
Officials are asking for $1 

million in US disaster relief 
funds to rebuild a bridge 
washed out by torrential rains 
in Mexico not the United 
States. 

The 1 ,OOO-foot bridge in 
Tijuana has linked rail freight 
service between San Diego 
and Imperial counties. At the 
time of the February storms, 
the Metropolitan Transit 
Development Board was 
pla~ning to begin freight 
serVIce. 

In all , 49 miles of the 
board's San Diego & Arizona 
Eastern Railway runs through 
Baja California and is 
controlled by the Sonora and 
Baja Railway. 

Tom Larwin, the board's 
general manager, said: "We 
haven't been told 'no' yet that 
we can't use the money outside 
the country." 

"My suspicion is we'l be 
turned down," Larwin said 
Sunday. 

A hurricane damaged 
portions of the rail line near the 
Imperial-San Diego county 
line. That damap haa been 
substantially repaired. But 
Larwin said Sonora and Baja 
Railway has yet to draw up 
plans for a new bridge. 

Meanwhile, Highway 1, 
which heavy winter rain runoff 
knocked out in February, is 
open all the way from the US 
border to Ensenada again.

Groucho Marxist cadre, IS 
entering its final stages - and 
word of our imminent success 
has leaked to the national

the public , so that the

In 1968, u part of a well·

Since then, our cadre have 
gained ever-increasing power, 
and have been preparing for 
the Comedic Revolution.

Experience Irrelevant -
Sillies Think Correctly 

Editor: 
In your article of May 8 about the victory of the Very Silly 

Slate, Vice President·e1ect Bill T opkis said he was "worried" 
about the qualifications of certain Very Silly candidates. He 

. claimed that they didn' t know anything about their posts. 
It's true the Very Silly Slate doesn't have a lot of 

"experrence" in the affairs of the AS, b that's probably why 
they were elected. The victory of th Very Silly students 
indicates that most people don't care too much about 
experience. 

I voted for the silly students because I thought a change 
was needed in the leadership of the AS. Experience can be 
easily acquired, but what's more important is that the leaders 
of the AS have the right intentions and beliefs.

AS Council Ended 
On Disgraceful Note 

Editor: 
As AS representative from Revelle College, I am disgusted 

and humiliated at the behavior of the council at last 
Wednesday's meeting. Having lost quorum in half an hour, 
the meeting was adjourned. 

Although the new council has been elected, the old council 
has not completed old business. There were items on the 
agenda that were short.changed due to irresponsible and 
uncommitted council members. 

It's disgraceful that the old council should end in this way . . 
To those organizations that were shafted, I apologize, and to 
next year's council, I wish you better luck. .

would (in the event Prop. 9 passes) end up paying taxes of 
only $117.33, a reduction of 70.1 percent, or $275.07" i. 
totally misleading. ThOle figures are accurate providing you . 
are married with II children or lingle with 14 children. 

Perhaps Redmond meant to say "taxable" income of 
$15,OOO? In that case, a married couple'. taxes would be 
reduced $112 (from $158to $46). Thus, thi, married couple 
does not now pay nor would they have their taxes reduced by 
the $275 that Redmond daims. .

Military Options In 
Iran Would Only 
Escalate ' Crisis 

BY WILLIAM ARKIN AND MICHAEL KLARE 
Pacific News Service 

The White House, vowed Defense Secretary Harold 
Brown after the failed rescue mission in Iran, "has not ruled 
out any option" in its continuing effort to free the hostages. 
Indeed , at the time many Pentagon observers fully expected 
that more grandiose military options were even then about to 
unfold. 

But does America really have any more military options in 
Iran? 

The question is il1}portant to consider, given the growing 
frustration over the nation's apparent impotence in the face of 
the hostage crisis. If that frustration continues very long, it is 
bound to result in growing public pressure on candidate 
Carter to resort to further military options. What are they; 
what military assets are available for carrying them out; and 
what are their risks? 

From the most limited to the full· scale, these are the 
William Arkin is a staff analysJ at the Center for Defense 

Information, and Michael Klare is a military affairs 
specialist at the Institute for Policy Studies . 
measures from which the President can choose : 

"'Covert operations - Secret sabotage·type missions, the 
sort used to topple the Allende regime in Chile, are an 
atl.ractive option because by definition they are clandestine 
and thus can be pursued while diplomatic maneuvers are still 
under way. 

To mount such operations, Washington has considerable 
assets: a large pool of former SA V AK agents and US·trained 
military personnel who, through friendship, inclination or 
avarice can be recruited for US-backed missions. Because 
these operatives can be easily mobilized and are already in 
place, or can be infiltrated without difficulty, it is natur.a1 to 
assume that Washington would be tempted to use them in 
some capacity. 

Potential covert operations include: participation in future 
rescue operations, or divisionary moves; sabotage of Iranian 
military and petroleum installations; incitement of political 
and religious strikes; promotion of anti·Khomeini terrorist 
activities and armed rebellion, especially among minority 
groups such as the Kurds, Arabs, and Baluchis; assassination 
of key government and religious leaders. 

The risks involved include the death of the US hostages if 
the operations are detected. Even if undetected , they could 
result in erosion of the Iranian government's authority with a 
concomitant risk to the hostages; internal riots and disorders 
resulting in the death of some or all of the hostages ; 
uncontrollable guerrilla warfare leading to the 
dismemberment of Iran and possible Soviet interventiqn; and 
a wider Mideast upheaval, resulting In US military 
intervention. 

"'Naval operations: of all possible military options, naval 
operations have been the most widely discussed in public. 
Certainly, US assets for such action are considerable: the 
.largest US Reet ever assembled in the Indian Ocean now 
comprising 32 warships, including two aircraft carriers with 
some 150 combat aircraft. This fleet can be augmented by 
other warships now deployed in the Atlantic and Pacific 
oceans. Optioos range from the mining of selected Iranian 
harbors to a complete blockade of Iranian shipping. 

Because such actions would be conducted off the coast of 
Iran, they are perhaps Ies~ risky than other military options. 
Nevertheless, the risks are considerable: the execution of 
some of all US hostages; the alienation of other Persian Gulf 
countries and of US allies dependent on Iranian oil; possible 
Iranian counter action leading to full· scale US military 
intervention; and possible confrontation with Soviet warships 
leading to a superpower conflict. 

'f Another rescue operation: despite the failure of the recent 
rescue attempt, Washington may be tempted to try another 
such effort once Iranian vigilance declines . Presumably, the 
assets for such a move are the same as those used before: an 
elite commando force with access to America's full military 
arsenal , plus the two US aircraft carriers in the Arabian Sea. 
moreover , any clandestine operatives infiltrated into Iran for 
the last raid are presumably still there. 

Now that the hostages have been dispersed, an exact 
replay of the last rescue attempt is out of the question. But 
several other options remain: multiple commando raids on 
some or all hostage locations, in conjunction with covert 
operations or other diversionary moves; or a full· scale 
military assault on the cities with the largest concentration of 
hostages. 

The risks of such an attempt are essentially the .ame as 
those of a naval blockade. In addition, another failure would 
generate widespread public frustration leading to even more 
extreme and dangerou. action. 

Clearly, even the most circumscrIbed military options pose 
a great ri.k of escalation and catastrophe. In none of the 
poaaible scenario, are the hostages likely to. aurvive. And 
each one courts the possibility or probability of wider war and 
deeper US humiliation. 

In short, our military options are not options at all. They 
are only path. to greater crisis. 

Man Shot By Police; 
He Yelle'd 'Kill Me!' 

AZUSA, Calif. - A man 
who called police and said he 
was going to "kill a cop" was 
shot to death by an officer who 
said the man yelled " Kill me ! 
Kill me!" and l\lnged at him 
with a machete and a police 
baton, officers said yesterday. 

. Azusa Police Lt. Gil 
Trujillo said Sgt. Ken 
MacChesney and four other 
officers went to the apartment 
of Richard Joseph Husava, 
2 1, at 11 :30 pm Sunday after 
residents complained about a 
disturbance. Trujillo said 
officers could hear screaming 
inside the apartment when 
they knocked on the door. 

He came to the door with 
baton in hand, Trujillo said, 
and yelled: "Come on in and 
get me." 

Neighbors said he then 
picked up a machete and 
lunged at MacChesney 
screaming: "Okay, go ahead 
and kill me! Kill me!" 

Although neighbor Frances 
Johnston said he had been 
"just crazy" before police 
arrived, other residents were 
baffled by his behavior. 

The managers of the 
apartment building, Robert 
and Roni McGuire, said 

Husava had resided there 
about a year and was "one of 
our better tenants. " 

"He always had a kind word 
for somebody, always 
something nice to say," said 
Mrs. McGuire. "That's why I 
was so surprised to hear about 
trouble at apartment 34," she 
added, referring to the victim's 
address. 

Test Shows New 
Fault Stress 

LOS ANGELES - A test 
well drated northeast of Los 
Angeles found that shallow 
rocks along the San Andreas 
Fault are under unusually high 
stress, says the US Geological 
SWVey. 

But geophysicist Barry 
Raleigh emphasized the 
finding is based on a single 
borehole. 

"Before we can come to any 
sound judgements we11 have 
to measure at several sites," 
Raleigh said. "It could be that 
11'5 high here and it might be 
low elsewhere."

Prime Rate Falls 
To 161/2 Percent 

NEW YORK - The prime 
lending rate dropped to 161f2 
percent a t some major banks 
yesterday, reflecting a steep 
drop in the demand for 
business loans as the economy 
sinks into a recession. 

Morgan Guaranty Trust 
Co., the nation's fifth .largest 
bank, cut its rate one full 
percentage point from the 
17 liz percent rate it had set just 
last week. Some other banks 
followed the move. 

The 161f2 percent level is 
the lowest since late February, 
when the prime began an 
upward surge that peaked at 
20 percent in early April . 
Since then, the rate has been 
on the decline . 

Wall Street analysts

borrowers - would drop even

Sadat Accepts 
31 Resignations 

CAIRO, Egypt 
President Anwar Sad at 

\ , 

accepted the resignations of all 
31 Cabinet ministers 
yesterday in a reorganization 
move expected to place 
greater emphasis on Egypt's 
domes tic problems of inflation, 
housing shortages and 
mounting religious strife. It 
was not believed there would 
be a significant shift in foreign 
affairs. 

Sadat asked Premier 
Mostafa Khalil to head a 
caretaker government, but did 
not ask him to form a new 
government, and observers 
saw this as an indication Sadat 
might take over the 
premiership. 

Khalil hu been Egypt's 
chief negotiator in the stalled 
Palestinian autonomy talks 
with Israel, which were 
suspended Thursday at 
Sadat's request, and he was 
asked what effect the 
government shakeup would 
have. 

He said the question "is 
premature. Everything will

"I think that the only way a 
school or campus is going to 
be closed is if the students stop 
coming," said Saxon. 

"Furthermore, I would hate 
to be in.the position of having 
taken an action that 15 years 
from now would be regarded 
as absolutely foo~.h. Anyone 
who think, about the future of 
health care needs in the state 
of California would quickly 
come to the conclusion that we 
need these medical schools to 

serve the state." . 
California is behind the 

national average of medical 
education al opportunities, 
according to Saxon. He said 
that young people graduating 
from coUege today have about

a medical education in 
California than the average

This is in contrast to recent 
national studies indicating 
there is an overabundance of

Saxon also said he does not 
agree with former UC

statement supporting tuition in

Officer Charged in Theft 
Conlinued from />age 1 
behind boxes used for 
camouflage in the bookstore. 

Before hiding under the 
couch, Riley had cleaned the 
cash box in order to get a good 
set of fingerprints in case a 
burglary occurred. 

Unnoticed, he watched a 
campus police officer enter the 
bookstore using a key, 
according to Viebrooks. 

Riley saw the po~ce officer 

go to the cash box drawer and 
take some bills, Viebrooks 
said. 

The officer was easy to 
identify because it was sunrise, 
she added. 

Viebrooks would not 
release the name of the 
accused officer pending 
litigation.

Shuttle Astronaut De-eDlphasizes Her Sex 
Kathryn Sullivan, Mission Specialist 
Talks Mostly About The Program 

BY MARK WILSON 
Staff Writer 

It's not easy to be one of 
only .ix women preparing to 
lift·off in NASA's Space 
Shuttle later in the 1980., but 
Kathryn SuI~van has found 
the experience to be quite 
meaningful-more as a 
scientist than as a woman. 

Speaking last Thursday 
evening to a group assembled 
in USB 2722, Sullivan talked 
primarill about the operation 
of the !)pace Shuttle and the 
functioning of its 35 astronaut 
candidates and placed less 
emphasis on her role as a 
woman in the program. 

"I'm there because I'm 
qualified," .he told the 
audience. "I know it and they 
know it." And .he is quufied. 

Sullivan did her undergrad. 
uate work in Earth Sciences at 
UC Santa Cruz and continued 
her studies to receive a 
doctorate at Dalhousie 
University in Nova Scotia. 

Her academic research 
involved the use of remote 
sensing to obtain data from the 
ocean floor and, she said, this 
experience led her to use the 
remote sensing technique in 
space. 

The Daily' Guardian 

Science 
"The opportunity to be in 

space viewing your own planet 
from such a radically different 
perspective intrigued me," she 
said. Sullivan seized this 
opportunity; she app~ed for 
and was eventually granted a 
chance to become a space 
shuttle candidate. 

Throughout her speech, 
S~van stressed that "the 
space shuttle is a cargo 
vehicle, the Greyhound bus or 
the Conastoga Wagon of the 
space frontier. It's incomplete

and sole element of the 
system." 

"It (the space shuttle) is 
meant to be a vehicle to get 
there (space) frequently and 

rela~iyely cheaply," she 
continued. 

The cargo hold of a .pace 
shuttle is 60 feet long and 15 
feet in diameter. It has been 
de.igned to carry virtually 
anything ranging from 
satemtes to .pace.labs, and, 
pos.ibly future construction 
materials. 

The projected start of the 
space shuttle's flight is March, 
1981 , beginning with a 
series of four test flights which 
will not involve any of the 35 
astronauts in the NASA 
program. The.e astronauts, 
like Kathryn Sullivan, will 
begin their Hights a year and a 
half after the .huttle' s first 
flight. 

The fir.t three experiments 
that are planned for the shuttle 
are, in order, a biological and 
medical package, an 
assemblage of astronomy 
experiments and a material

solidifying such things as 
metals and glass together will 
be explored, and the 
possibilities creating new 
materials, with the combined 
properties of each. 

Another planned project for 
the shuttle is the placement of 
a apace telescope outside the 
Earth', atmosphere which 
could overcome the difficulties

Screening For Tay-Sachs Disease Is Free 
Continued trom /XIRe 1 
genetic disease. For a child to 
be affected , it must receive one 
recessive gene from each 
parent. Carriers, who are 
individuals with one of the 
recessive Tay·Sachs genes, 
are perfectly normal, healthy 
people. 

Jews of eastern European 
descent, current medical 
statistics have shown 
otherwise. 

" However , it was not 
known until the late 1960s 
what actually CilUSed Tay-
Sachs," he said. 

John O'Brien of the UCSD 
School of Medicine found that 
Tay-Sachs was " a storage 
disease" caused by the lack of 
a c rucial e nzy me. This 
enzyme, hexosami nidase , 

breaks fatly substances that 
would otherwise accumulate in 
the brain and other body 
tissues. 
. Today , there are alterna-
tives for couples finding that 
they are both carriers of the 
fatal Tay-Sachs gene. Such 
parents, called "high risk" 
couples by doctors. have a 25 

~rcent chance of producing a 
Tay-Sachs child. 

Bernstein stresses the 
importance of encouraging 
everyone to be tested . "Even if 
a person has no intention of 
having a child , this person can 
at least notify other family 
members if he or she if lound to 
be a carrier. " 

"Everyone is a carrier lor at 
least seven or eight possibly 
lethal recessive genes," 

"Presently, one in 27 Jews 
of eastern European descent is 
a carrier for the Tay-Sachs 
gene, and one in 200 persons 
in the general population carry 
the potential for the disease," 
Bernstein says.

Yet the shuttle's main 
advantage is that it is 
reuseable. " A reuseable 
vehicle gives you the 
opportunity to go back into 
space to a satellite that is in 
use, already being productive, 
and either change it, maintain 
it, repair it or bring it back 
home." Sullivan suggested 
that this capability would be 
very attractive to commercial 
users of the shuttle. 

Sullivan'~ job as a mission 
.pecialist, which is similar to 
that of a chief scientist'. on a 
research vessel, is not an 
ordinary one. "Although there 
is a lot of fun, excitement and 
challe"f.e in the job and I 
wouldn t trade it for anything 
known on Earth, it is like any 
other job, in one respect. 

"To get something as good 

as a successful space shuttle 
mission, there are lots of small, 
mundane and seemingly 
meaningless things that have 
to be taken care of, and they 
all have to be don e 
conscientiously and done 
right." 

Part of her present work is 
making general reviews of the 
systems in which she works. 
Not only must these systems 
function, they must also be 
comfortable for the astro-
nauts. Another part of her job 
is to cooperate with other 
scientists in developing 
experiments for the shuttle that 
make use of its capabilities 
rather than working against 
them. 

It iI estimated that the 
shuttle, once it becomes fully 
operational, will be making 40 
to 60 flights a year, but this 
goal is still distant. Until then, 
Sullivan and her fellows will 
keep on training.

Bookstore Cash Box Pilfered 
Continued from page 4 
Riley brought charges against 
the officer he had seen ente!: 
the bookstore. 

Riley and the bookstore's 
cash box drawer were brought 
down to the police station, 
accompanied by the officer 
charged and VJebrooks, who 
had arrived to open the 
bookstore. 

much good," said Carlson. 
After this robbery, the 

Crafts Center stopped 
handling cash and began 
accepting only endorsed 
checks to the UC Regents. 
Their cash box was 
subsequently hidden in a 
different location, and a 
second robbery attempt was 
unsuccessful, Carlson said. 
There was no vandalism. 

number of robberies on 
campus has greatly increased 
since custodians were taken 
off night duty in order to save 
money. Carlson believes the 
janitors were a deterrent to 
thefts. 

Despite the break·ins, the 
Crafts Center has not changed 
its locks, due to the expense. 

there was no vandalism, and 
campus have not found any 
suspects, according to Corlew. 

The Food Coop took 
protective measures after that 
robbery. In addition to the 
deadbolt, they . stopped 
keeping money in the store. 

A month before the March 
robbery, the Food Coop had 
discovered $40 missing, "but 
this may have been a 
bookeeping error, " said 
Corlew. 

The robbery attempts at the 
Food Coop continue, and 

"there is an attempt to break in 
at least once every two 
weeks," said Corlew. 

Mary Ann Mason , 
custodial maintenanc e 
supervisor at EDNA, also 
reported theft problems. There 
have been small discrepancies 
in the cash box that holds 
vending machine money, she 
said. But they have not been 
reported to campus police, 
because they "could not 
pinpoint who, what or why the 
money was missing," said 
Mason. At the police station, Riley 

was asked who was employed 
at the bookstore: "The police 
asked whether Jon Bekken, 
Barry Hyman and practically 
the whole staff of the new 
indicator worked for the 
bookstore," said Viebrooks. 

After the robberies, campus 
police were notified. No 
detectives were brought in, no 
fingerprints were taken and nQ 
suspects were found, said 
Carlson. 

The Food Coop, however, 
has installed a deadbolt on its 
front door in response to a 
March 18 burglary, when the 
front door was forced open 
and more than $250 was 
stolen, according to coop 
member Bob Corlew.

Carlson said that the Like the Crafts Center, 
Other thefts in the Student 

Center have been reported this 
year, but there is no evidence 
that Thursday's bookstore 
theft is connected with them.
