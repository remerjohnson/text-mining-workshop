Carruthers orders Che Cafe closed; 
collective votes to stay open anyway 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
N~wlEdlttw 

Amid accusations by Che Cafe members 
that the administration knew about rat in-
feltation problems in the cafe's kitchen and 
failed to effectively do anything about it, the 
Che was closed over the weekend by 
University Center Director Jim Carruthers 
for endangering "the public health," but 
members of the Che planned to resist by 
holding a free breakfast at 8 a.m. this 
morning. 

Over 300 flyers and several banners were 
made up by Che members last night in 
preparation for an anticipated attempt by 
the UCSD police to close the restaurant. 
Keith Abouaf, the Che member responsible 
for health and safety, said that "the collective 
will remain open using any means possible, .. 
though he did not specifically state the 
means. 

Campus Sanitarian Bill Bernard recom-
mended last Monday that the Che be closed. 
In a memo to Carruthers, Bernard recom-

mended that he "close the food facility to 
abate a potential public health hazard." He 
went on to say that once the rat control 
problem was eliminakd "once and for all ... 
we can work together to discuss the future of 
the food facility." 

Carruthers notified Abouaf on Thursday 
that the Che was supposed to be closed. 
Abouaf called Bernard and asked him if the 
Che could remain open if some sheet metal 
was placed over the holes in the kitchen 
where the rats were coming in. Abouaf 
claims that Bernard agreed, as did 
Carruthers, and the metal was installed on 
Thursday. 

Carruthers, Abouaf, other co-op members, 
and A.S. President Maynard Dimmesdale 
agreed on Friday to have an inspector from 
Environmental Health and Services (EHclS) 
examine the Che to determine if the rat 
problem had been solved. The EHclS, a 
UCSD department, which Barnard works 
for, may only make recommendations to the 
administrator in charge of a particular 
problem. In this case, that administrator is 

Carruthers. 
Instead of waitin~ until Monday, though, 

Carruthers inspected the Che Saturday 
morning. In an interview last night, he said 
that he went with the intention of checking 
out the work Abouaf had done. Abouaf, 
Dimmesdale, and Tamar Murachvr, another 
co-op member who was at Friday's meeting, 
all claim that Carruthers agreed that the Che 
could clean up whatever rats remained over 
the weekend in order to prepare for Monday's 
inspection. 

Carruther's disagrees. "My comment is 
that the public health situation [is foremost]," 
he said . "They had two events over the 
weekend ... [and] it's my understanding that 
the kitchen was available ... Abouaf conceded 
that events were held both Friday and Satur-
day, but he didn't know iffood was served or 
not. 

"I was outraged he had gone in on Satur-
day," Murachvr said in an interview last 
night. Dimmesdale also was surprised at 
Carruther's actions: "When I left [Friday'sl 
meeting, the agreement was this - the Che 

would stay open pending an 
inspection on Monday, when En-
vironmental Health and Services 
came by." 

Carruthers responded by re-
iterating several times that he 
was first and foremost interested 
in the public health, and that he 
had not agreed not to come in 
over the weekend. "The problem 
is larger than the solutions we've 
attempted," he said. 

While in the kitchen Saturday 
morning, Carruthers found a rat 
lying dead in a trap, which he 
considered ample evidence that 
there was still a rodent problem 
at the Che· 

That afternoon Abouaf re-
ceived a memo from Carruthers 
that outlined his conclusions and 
recommendations. "The rat in-
festation problem at the Che 
continues to be a public health 
hazard," he began, noting that 
"all of our collective efforts do 
not seem to be solving the 
problem." 

"We agreed in our Friday 
meeting, that if any further trace 
of rats were found in the kitchen 
area, we would close. We do not 
need to wait for an inspector to 
confirm the obvious, " Carruthers 
wrote. Abouaf claims that the 
rat Carruthers saw was trapped 
in the kitchen Thursday when 
the sheet metal was being in-
stalled, and that "several people 
had seen the same rat in the same 
place the next couple of days." 

Thus, Abouaf says, that rat 
was the last remaining remnant 
of the problem. Carruthers dis-
agreed, and wrote in his memo 
that "The kitchen and food pro-
duction will remain closed until 
EHclS is satisfied that we no 
longer present a public health 
hazard." 

Among the problems facing 
the Che, according to Carruthers, 
is its location in an environment 
conducive to rodent problems. 
"It's a breeding situation," he 
said. He refers in his memo to a 
"program for eradication" that 
may include "efforts at the Re-
Cycle Co-op, and Farm Co-
op/ garden", but he denied he 
wanted to do away with the 
project , only get "them away

Musician 
Continued from palf 1 
cine. 

As an accomplished musician, 
Lytle admits that he is "some-
thing of an anomaly," particu-
larly because it is rare for "musi-
cians and artists to play an active 
role on campus." According to 
Lytle, academics such as physi-
cal scientists and social scientists 
tend to think in a systematic 
way, which often lends them to 
function better than artists at 
administrative levels. Lytle hopes 
to use the insight he has gained 
as a musician to ignite a "creative 
spark" in undergraduate and 
graduate learning. In fact, Lytle 
believes that a student's success 
should not be measured only by 
what is learned in classes, but 
also by success in human devel-
opment. 

Lytle feels that this success is 
marked by a broad knowledge of 
various subjects, or "breadth" in 
general education terminology. 
By adhering to this philosophy, 
an engineer should be educated 
in humanities while a liberal arts 
major should be educated in 
scientific progress. 

Additionally, Lytle believes 
that there is presently a differ-
ence between those upper-di-
vision students who are desig-
nated as Research Assistants and 
those designated as Teaching 
Assistants. This, according to 
Lytle, is symptomatic of UCSD 
and of a Western educational 
system divided between teaching 
and researching. By focusing 
more on the individual college 
rather than on departmental 
efforts, a system can be created 
in which students understand 
both "different methodologies as 
well as the nuts and bolts" of 
their discipline. 

This is better accomplished in 
a college-oriented university . 
rather than a department-orien-
tated university because, in the 
former, instructors from varying 
fields can contribute to student's 
growth, Lytle said. He is con-
vinced that "educators spend too 
much time telling what to do and 
not so much why to do it." 

The position of Provost, Lytle 
feels, is unique in that the Pro-
vost has the ability to "create an 
environment" at the individual 
college. Lytle bas outlined goals 

that he would like to accomplish 
while at Third College. Among 
them, Lytle would like to "in-
crease the faculty appointments 
to support interdisciplinary and 
ethnic studies of the college." 

While this is a departure from 
the more traditional approach of 
departmental faculty appoint-
ments, Lytle steadfastly believes 
that thil is a major issue for all of 
the colleges, especially the new 
Fifth College, with its emphasis 
on International Studies. 

UCSD's colleges, said Lytle, 
"are a hotbed of ideas." In fact, 
the emergence of some of the 
University'S newer departments, 
such as COmmunications and 
Urban Studies, from individual 
colleges, indicated the power of 
the individual colleges to influ-
ence the University's develop-
ment, Lytle views Third College 
as especially exciting because of 
its focus on interdisciplinary 
programs, whereas "Revelle is 
commonly associated with the 
physical sciences and Muir with 
humanities. " 

With UCSD's recent rapid 
growth, Lytle strongly believes 
that each college's staff can be 
strengthened in number. Lytle 
contends that UCSD has the 
same number of staff as ten years 
ago when the campus had one-
third fewer students. This has 
resulted in problems such as ri-
diculously long registration lines. 
"We can't have another commit-
tee or study kick it around for 
five years," said Lytle. "I think 
the Administration will under-
stand the problems if ... one of 
the vice chancellors is asked to 
stand in line.... [Afterall,] stu-
dents are our customers." 

Lytle would also like to see 
more senior faculty involvement 
in -,he University. Lytle notes 
that there is currently"a core of a 
couple dozen senior faculty 
mostly involved in the colleges ... 
The more established and famous 
faculty members - who Lytle 
jokingly refers to as the "gla-
mourpusses" - should teach 
both introductory courses and 
senior-level courses, thereby 
allowing students to "rub shoul-
ders with the best in the busi-
ness ... 

Lytle's plans for the future of 
Third College appear to be well 
defined. As far as his personal 
plans once his term begins, the 
new provost wants to ensure that

Lytle was born and raised in 
Harlem, New York . By the age

Biology reforms

fltr reforms was substantially 
ailltrltd. Hltrlt is the fNUl of'hlt tut

By J. BERESFORD-HOWE 
Oplldoll Edit", 

Spurred by a professor angry 
over troubles his T As had get-
ting credit for classes taken at 
other universities, the Biology 
Department is nearing a radical 
reform of its advising and transfer 
policies. 

Among the changes under 
consideration: 
• Elimination of the Biology I, 

2 and J requirement. The classes 
would become "highly recom-
mended," and not mandatory. 

• Full credit for basic biol-
ogy, physics and math classes 
taken at other universities. Cur-
rently, the department rarely 
gives students credit for study. 

• A shift in the advising sys-
tem which would assign all stu-

dents to a faculty advisor but 
allow any faculty member to 
advise any student. Students now 
mostly see a staff advisor when 
trying to transfer credits from I 
other universities or departments. 

• Institution of orientation 
sessions for transfer students. 

A consensus for these changes 
emerged at an al1-day Biology 
Department meeting Saturday, 
May 7, according to Biology 
Professor Milton Saier and 
Department Chair Richard 
Dutton. 

"The changes will be very much 
along the lines of what we talked 
about at the meeting," Dutton 
said. 

A final list of recommenda-
tions based on that meeting and 
subject to approval of the entire 
faculty was considered [May II 
and 12] by the department's 
Undergraduate Curriculum Com-
mittee. 

Saier IS primarily responsible 
for bringing the debate to the 
department.

Fight for Rights 
Dr. Milton Saier, Bard-Alan Finlan and Kristen 

Crabtree will probably never get together to share a 
glass of wine, but they share experiences which have 
the potential to benefit us all. 

All three took on the University and, in the face of 
massive bureaucratic inertia, or hostility, appear to 
have won at least some kind of victory. If we take 
their gutsiness to heart , we can change the Univer-
sity. 

Saier, a professor of biology, challenged his 
department over its transfer and advising policies . 
The department 's hard-nosed members wanted to 
give UCSD a reputation (at the expense of its 
students) as a tough place unwilling to accept 
anyone else's sense of what comprises a biology 
class. Staff advisers supporting that policy were told 
to just say no to undergraduate petitions. Saier 
sought and documented the cases of 15 students 
who had been forced to repeat classes taken at other 
universities . Because of Saier's activism in the face 
of a hostile department, students will, pending a 
biology department faculty vote, be able to go to 
faculty advisers expert in biology instead of un-
trained staff and get credit where credit is due. 

Finlan, a quiet undergraduate, had his records 
opened to an extra-university agency by a university 
more concerned about cooperation between bureau-
cracies than student privacy. UCSD's actions were 
and are clearly illegal and injurious to Finlan, yet 
the University has found it impossible to admit 
error. The tenacious Finlan has pursued his case for 
nine months . He still has no admission of guilt from 
the University , but A .S . president Maynard Dim-
mesdale is considering his appointment as A.S. 
student legal advocate. 

Crabtree, a well-known activist undergraduate, 
was arrested at a speech by a Contra (you know, the 
ones like our founding fathers) and charged with 
assaulting a police officer. After a closed hearing at 
Third College (closed for reasons known only to the 
administration; Crabtree waived her right to privacy 
and asked for an open hearing), she was acquitted 
on the assault charges but then convicted on charges 
of carrying a concealed weapon, i.e., a form of brass 
knuckles she carries, like many women, as a possible 
line of defense against rape . Crabtree never pulled 
out or used the brass knuckles at any time during the 
incident. For this "offense," she has been placed on 
disciplinary probation for the rest of her life at 
UCSD. Her hearing was not "legal" in the sense of 
having the force of law; in a court of law, the case 
would have been thrown out after the original 
assault charges were dropped. Crabtree is appealing 
within the University's legal structure. We think she 
should sue in a real court for denial of due process. 

There was no breakdown in protection of the 
rights of students in these various cases; the fact is 
that students have precious few rights to begin with. 
As Saier pointed out in a commentary last week in 
the Guardian, students and faculty are not chal-
lenging the administration, allowing it to rule by fiat. 

We ask Chancellor Atkinson to appoint a special 
campus committee to study the problem of student 
input and representation in academic, disciplinary 
and policy-making areas. We ask also that the 
committee be composed of students, faculty and 
staff at UCSD and have the freedom to investigate 
all areas of administrative life, and that the 
committee be charged with finding ways to open 
administrative decision-making. 

We'd like the see the A.S. appoint a similar 
committee on its own toward the goal of creating a 
comprehensive student policy on student involve-
ment in the administration. 

We would also like to see the A.S. publicize 
heavily and devote extensive time and money to its 
legal service function , Further, we'd like to see an 
A.S . Ombudsperson's Office of experienced . stu-
dents as a first resort for students dealing WIth a 
confusing and aLientating structure.

Letters 

Jackson at 
Convention 
Editor: 

I would Ii ke to correct a statement 
that appeared in an article entitled 
"UCSD grad is Jackson delegate" 
[Guardian, May 5). 

The mistaken sentence reads as 
follows : "Wainio plans to support 
an educational bill of rights being 
developed by the California Alliance 
of Progressive Student Activists 
(CAPSA),-which will be presented 
for adoption at the convention." 

Actually, the educational bill of 
rights is being developed by the 
three California Third World student 
networks: A/ PSU (The Asian / Pa-
cific Islander Student Union), A/ 
BSSA (African / Black Student 
Statewide Alliance) and MEChA 
(Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano 
de Aztlan). 

The three Third World networks 
organized a major conference on 
education (at which Jesse Jackson 
spoke) at Stanford University May 
14. It is out of this conference that 
the educational bill of rights -
stressing the need to make education 
serve the needs of the majority of 
people, not just the privileged few -
will emerge. Students will then bring 
this document to the Democratic 
Party convention in Atlanta in July, 
in an attempt to have it adopted by 
the Democrats as their platform on 

education. 

CAPSA has been invited by the 
Third World networks to participate 
in the conference, as bave the student 
government associations of the Uni-
versity of California, California 
State Univenity system and Cali-
fornia's community coUeges. Butthe 
conference on education, the edu-
cational bill of rights, and the nation-
wide movement to democratize our 
educational system are aU being led 
by students of color. 

By the way, keep up the good 
work . The Guardia" has been 
showing steady signs of improve-
ment for the past several months. 
Your endonement of the people's 
candidate for President, Jesse Jack-
son, was a clear indication tbat you 
people know what you're doing.

'Repressive 
Editor: 

I was very amused by Joe Watson's 
assertion that the Univenity was 
correct in accessing a student's 
record even though it violated UC 
Policy [Guardia", May 9]. 

How hypocritical can an offICial 
get? It is the very heart ofthe UCSD 
system: "Rules Cannot Bend. ". have 
seen many unfair and some UJICODlti-
tutionallaws come into effect at this 
school; no matter what the case is a 
student has no choice but to obey

Former Che member and 
UCSD alumni Scott Kessler 
claimed that "they [the admin-

in, down. They've tried a number 
of ways to shut down the rest-
aurant. Rata are being used as a 
subterfuge for stopping student 
control of autonomous spaces."

Abouaf claims that all the 

problema with the prden and 
the compost acne rated by the

that Carruthers and the ad-
ministration have ulterior 
motives as far as the Che ia 
concerned. "The Univenity haa 
an obvious .take in seein, the 
ChC closed," he said . 

About a month a,o the Che 
wa. shut down because of the rat 
problem, and the co-op memben 
cleaned out the place thorouJhly. 
Accordin, to Abouaf, the Uni-
venity Center was supposed to 
seal up the kitchen so that rats 
could not act in, but instead of 
usin, metal, they use styrofoam, 
which the rata ate thru rather 
rapidly. 

"We told them not to styro-
foam," Abouafsaid. "I'mcertain 
the Che people thought that was 
intentional." He explained that 
the Che suspected the ad-
ministration was trying to ensure 
the rat problem at the restaurant 
became so severe that it could 

Carruthen denied the charge. 
"From where I sit, I think the 
Che plays a very important role 
in the cultural and social life of 
the univenity," he said . 

Asked why he didn't take 
action sooner to arrest what 
became a serious rodent problem, 
he said he didn't know about it 
until EH.tS pointed it out in 
April. However, co-op member 
Tamar Murachvrclaims that SO~

cusses the rat problem. Tucker 
could not be reached for com-

Sister Mary Hartman 
Crossing international and cultural 
borders to help those in need 

By VINCENT ANDRADE 
GUG,diGII [lite,,, 

She is a quiet, reser"ed woman. 
Seemingly meant for a life of solitude 
and devout meditation, she has worked 
for the last 26 years in Nicaragua fight-
ing misery and poverty. 

It is the deprivation and death she has 
witnessed there which have taught her 
the importance and value of individual 
human dignity. 

Horrified by the violence with which 
transnational corporations treated the 
people of Nicaragua as an expendable 
labor force, Sister Mary Hartman came 
to understand the importance of self-
determination of a state and its people. 
This American nun has witnessed what 
she calls brutality and violence of Amer-
ican foreign policy, first under the 
puppet dictatorship of Somoza, and 

then, after the formation of the Sandi-
nista government in 1979, by the low-
intensity warfare waged by the CIA-
backed Contras under the Reagan 
administration . 

In the early '60s Sister Mary Hartman 
was sent down to Nicaragua as part of 
the Catholic Church's program of evan-
gelizing Latin America. Working oI1lhe 
Atlantic coast with the Miskito Indians 
she taught English to primary and 
secondary school students. Hartman 
was shocked to see the rampant tuber-
culosis among the Miskito caused by 
work in mines and by living condi-
tions which encouraged the spread of 
the disease from the mine workers to 
their families. She was equally disturbed 
by the lack of care or compassion. 

"No one was concerned about this 
because there was always someone to 
take their place" Hartman said. 

The food, clothing, and medicine 
which was sent down underscored what 
was still lacking. It was, she said, "like 
putting a band-aid on a cancer spot. 
There was never enough for everybody, 
and the sickness broke out alain." 
Hartman was likewise horrified by the 
general perception ofthe pooras an inev-
itable, natural occurrence. 

According to Hartman, "never think-
ing of the 'why' of it all, that the poor 
you will always have with you," and the 
role religion plays in offering a distant 
reward but not a foreseeable improve-
ment, left a firm impression and came to 
affect her own work. 

After working on the Atlantic coast 
of Nicaragua, Hartman was sent to work 
in Managua, the capital of Nicaragua. 
According to Hartman, the earlier 
experience of desperate poverty while 
working with the Miskito Indians had 
laid the groundwork for an openness to 
the Theology of Lil]eration she found 
developing in the barrios of ManaJUB. 

Liberation Theology as an "option 
for the poor" developed in the early 
'60s. "It made people realize their own 
importance, and that they could form 
their own destiny," Hartman empha-
sized. 

"Support of dictatorships 
instead of democratically-
elected presidents" has 
been the foreign policy of 
the United States in relation 
to Latin America. 

-Sister Mary Hartman 

Contrary to the established church 
which was part ofthe social hierarchy of 
Latin American society, the Popular 
Church of Liberation Theology sup-
ported and unified the poor in the bar-
rios and countryside, not only of Nica-
ragua, but in all of Latin America, 
Hartman said. 

This new theology received approval 

Sister Mary Hartman has devoted 26 
years to helping others in Nicaragua. 

at a meeting of Latin American bishops 
in Medellin, Columbia, and was ac-
cepted by the Church hierarchy. 

According to Hartman, approval, 
however, within the established church 
was not whole-hearted since it required 
that the clergy de-emphasize the rich 
and secure upper-classes and re-focus 
their ministry on the poor and desperate 
peasants. This meant evangelizing and 
living among the lower classes in the 
process of rediscovering Christ's origi-
nal ministering to the poor, she said . 

In Managua, Hartman mel a diligent 
young priest working in a barrio cum-
munity preaching the Theology of Lib-
eration. She described how the priest 
taught that the barrio Christian com-
munity should "organize themselves and 
work for each other and not' live a life of 
competition." This philosophy shaped 
her own world-view ofthe Third World 
citizenry. 

Hartman claims that she found her 
niche in this struggle for the oppressed 
and poverty-stricken of Nicaragua, and 
that she has come to see the importance 
01 the nght to self-determination for the 
Nicaraguan state and its people. 

In her worle as a nun for the welfare of 
the down-trodden of Nicaragua, Hart-
man witnessed the overthrow of the 
oppressive Somoza dictatorship which

I Several years ago, Saigon Penn charged the San Diego Police department 

with police brutality. In recent 
months, the murder of Karen 
Knott has brought even more 
scandal to the department's al-
ready tarnished reputation. With 
the community's growing distrust 
in the police force as a whole, 
Deputy Chief of Police Norman 
Stamper is working to facilitate 
better relations between the de-
partment and the community. 

Stamper, noted as being the 
"resident intellectual," is develop-
ing a Ph.D. thesis and book on 
the discrepancies between the 
values and the policies of big -city 
police executives. 

pared their comments with those 
of the people working below the 
executives to see if the chiefs 
were actually doing what they 
professed. The survey's statistics 
will show whether the police 
chiefs are "practicing what they 
preach," said Stamper. 

Stamper feels his most signifi-
cant achievement is "working in 
an organization ofvery connict-
ing values . .. in a harmonious 
way.

As early as 1973, Stamper 
formulated a program in an 
effort to get police officers closer 
to the community by having tllcir 
beats extended in a particular 
neighborhood or community. 

"Effective and re-
sponsive action re-
quires support from 
both the police force 
and the community." 

-Norman Stamper 
Deputy Police Chief 

"The program envisioned 
police officers as community 
analysts," said Stamper, and 
allowed the officers to "use more 
imagination and creativity in 
problem solving." Stamper be-
lieves that "effective and respon-
sive action requires support from 
both the police force and the 
community." His central idea is 
to "provide police officers with 
awareness and sensitivity . .. hard 
knowledge and skills . .. [and an 
ability] to get the job done."

they must suppose that the 
information is appropriate and-
l or informative. 

And according to Regan, 
who's doing his best to make 
these revelations as long-lasting, 
messy, and lucrative as possible, 
said horoscopes were influential 
in the White House, to the point 
where calendars were color-
coded to indicate what the stars 
said about that day in Ronnie's 
life. 

Conservative apologists keep 
pointing to figures in the his-
torical past who've used astro-
logical advisers, such as Queen 
Elizabeth I and Adolf Hitler. I'm 
surprized they haven't brought 
up Albrecht von Wallenstein, a 
generalissimo who during the 30 
Years War had his horoscope 
drawn up by no less than 
Johannes Kepler. 

Now here's the part that makes 
me mad. Education Secretary 
William Bennet has consistently 
complained that schools aren't 
working hard enough, colleges 
aren't making students work 
hard enough, public education's 
doing a lousy job, we need more 
and better scientific education, 
we need education like it was in 
the good old days, we should 
support parochial schools 
because they do a better job, 
yammer yammer yammer. 

I won't deny the state of 
education in this country is dread-
ful. But here I am. sweating away 
in three Revelle-style non-con-
tigious fields of study, including 
a minor in math, after 12 years of 
public school. On the one hand 
I'm being told I'm a lazy 
ignoramus and, on the other 
hand, the first lady is beholden 
to a musty Babylonian predic-
tive pseudo-science. 

Maybe this country should 
elect Shirley McLaine for 
President. Maybe, despite what 
Bennett says, we need a re-
education policy more than we 
need a new educational policy, 
although an ounce of prevention 

Maybe we've just found out 
why the Reagan Administration 
seemed to be reacting more than 
acting in major world crises. 
They've been holding off until 
the psychic advice came in. 

Oh yeah, I nearly forgot to tell 
you what happened to von WaUen-
stein. One night in 1634 he woke 
in his bed to find his bodyguards 
preparing to butcher him with 
swords and halberds . I don't 
think Kepler predicted that. 

Lions 
Continued from pale .. 
Preservation Fund. 

The message is clear and 
frightening - if a grassroots 
organization is opposed to the 
State's mismanagement of our 
natural resources, that organi-
zation may be sued by the State. 

Why are the DFG and the 
FGC so bull-headed and insistent 
on carrying out a mountain lion 
trophy hunt? Perhaps it has to 
do with the fact that all of the 
Deukmejian-appointed Fish and 
Game Commissioners are hun-
ters with no background in 
wildlife management. 

Please write to the governor at 
the State Capitol , Sacramento,

mountain lion trophy hunt .

Softball 
finished 

St. Thomas 
beats Tritons 
2-1 in 9 

By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

Another heartbreaker for 
Triton athletics reared its head 
last week as the UCSD women's 
softball team was eliminated from 
national competition with a 2-1 
loss to St. Thomas College of 
Minnesota in their third game of 
the 1988 NCAA Western Re-
gionals. 

Details of the final game of the 
Triton softball season were un-
available by press time. It is 
known that the game went two 
innings beyond the regulation 
seven. The Tritons finish their 
season with a record of 35-10-1. 

The Tritons had faced St. 
Thomas in the first game of 
competition and lost, 3-2. 

St. Thomas scored two runs in 
the fifth inning with a single by 
Kathy O'Reily to take the lead 
for good . . 

The Tritons had led by scores 
of 1-0 (after an RBI triple in the 
first inning by Tracy Kehr) and 
2-1 (Kehr scored in the fourth on 
an error) but could not hold on 

for the win. 
UCSD managed four hits in 

the game. Triton starter Stacy 
Sasaki took the loss, allowing 
seven hits through seven innings. 
Jean Eweld earned the win for 
St. Thomas. 

Playing in the losing bracket , 
the Tritons faced No.4 Luther 
College. Luther had lost to the 
top ranked Central College 8-2 
in their first game. 

The Tritons eliminated Luther 
(5-10) from further competition 
with a 2-1 win. 

UCSD drew first blood in the 
fifth inning when starting pitcher 
Patty Hurtt drove in Pam Har-
nack with a single. 

Luther tied the game in the 
seventh with four straight singles 
after two outs had already been 
recorded. However, they left the 
bases loaded when Harnack 

. . ~ 

snagged a sharp grounder down 
the first base line for the putout. 
With runners going on the pitch, 
had that gotten through, Luther 
would had an easy two more 
runs. 

Harnack then led off the bot-
tom of the seventh inning with a 
walk. Two sacrifice bunts later, 
Harnack scored from third on a 
passed ball by Danielle Kittleson 
(9-5). Hurtt (16-4) got the win. 

Behrens finishes second at Nationals 
By JONA THAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's tennis 
team's season ended early last 
week with a frustrating 5-4 loss 
to Kenyon College in the semi-
final round of the 1988 NCAA 
Division III National Champion-
ships. But Christine Behrens, the 
team's No. I player, wasn't fin-
ished yet , having qualified for 
the individual tournament for 
singles play. 

Despite her third place finish 
in last year's tournament, Behrens 
was unranked this year. She 
cruised through her matches in 
the team competition and easily 
won her first two preliminary 
matches. In fact , she took the 
quarterfinals against Anne Wil-
liams of Franklin and Marshall 
College in 37 minutes, 6-2, 6-0. 

She then upset the No. 4 ranked 
Lynn Greer of Whitman College 
in Washington in three sets, 6-2, 
2-6, 6-4 to make it to the finals 

Cycling to Nationals 
The UCSD cycling team 

finished fourth in a field of 22 
teams two weekends ago (May 
7-8) at the 1988 Western Col-
legiate Cycling Conference 
Championships. 

Hosted by UC Irvine, the 
two-day competition consisted 
of a 3.75-mile individual time 
trial and a criterium on the 
UCI campus. The champion-
ship was also to include a 
road race around Lake Mat-
thews, but the event was can-
celled due to poor planning: 
the course would have taken 
the riders onto roads with 
heavy traffic. 

UCSD went into the race 
tied for third place with Stan-
ford, behind Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo and UC Santa 
Barbara, the second and first 
place teams, respectively. Cal 
Poly SLO took the cham-
pionships this time, Stanford 
took second place and UCSB 
finished third . 

By placing in the top six 
during the regular season, the 

UCSD cycling team will be 
allowed to send its top five 
men and top three omen to 
Nationals, to be held in the 
hills of San Luis Obispo, 
California. 

UCSD's national partici-
pants in the men's division 
this year are Mark Wineman, 
Andy Nevitt, Jeff Winkler, 
Mike Robertson, and Larry 
Fiorentino. Dave Warren will 
attend as an alternate. 

The UCSD women will be 
represented by Cindy Brown, 
Christi Wellington and Sherri 
Coble, with Jennifer Poodry 
as the alternate. 

Twenty-four teams will be 
invited to Nationals from the 
five conferences around the 
United States: Western, Ea t-
ern, Rocky Mountain, South 
Central, and South Western. 
With the way the UCSD 
cycling team ha performed, 
they could be in the running 
for a top spot thi year.

where the competition was bound 
to get tough. 

Playing for the other final spot 
were Carolyn Bodart of Menlo 
College and the No. I seed Julie 
Harvanik of Trenton State. 

"We were rooting for Carolyn 
to win the match," said Triton 
Head Coach Liz laPlante. 

"Christine didn't want to play 
Julie . Julie tends to lob the ball a 
lot which is frustrating for an 
opponent," laPlante said. 

With hindsight, Behrens and 
laPlante may have wanted to 
face Bodart as the Menlo Col-
lege player beat Harvanik in three 
sets, 6-4, 6-7, 6-4 and then pro-
ceeded to take the title with a 7-6, 
2-6, 6-3 win over Behrens. 

Behrens had faced Bodart once 
already, this year in a dual match 
at Menlo, but had lost decisively, 
6-2,6-4. 

"That was a pretty one-sided 
match," laPlante said. 

This time, Behrens gave it her 
all, but a few key points by 

Bodart made the difference. 
"[Behrens] felt she had played 

her best. [Bodart] just mixed up 
her shots enough to take the 
match," laPlante said. 

Because of her second place 
finish, sophomore Behrens 
earned All-American honors for 
the second straight year. 

Behrens also qualified for 
doubles with partner (and team 
captain) Rhonda Meier. Unfor-
tunately, they had to play the No. 
I singles player Harvanik and 
her partner in their first round. 

"They both [the Trenton team] 
stood back at the baseline and 
lobbed all their shots," laPlante 
said. "We had to hit 10 over-
heads in a row to win a point." 

Meier and Behrens just could 
not keep up and eventually lost 
the match 6-3, 6-7, 6-2. 

The Trenton team made it all 
the way to the final round where 
they lost to the team from 
Pomona-Pitzer. 

Track qualifies 5th 
runner to Nationals 

Gisele English's 4:37.06 time in the 1,500-meter run Saturday at 
Occidental made her the fifth UCSD track team member who will be 
heading to Nationals. 

The other four UCSD students who will compete in the national 
meet (which will be held in Northfield, Minnesota from May 24-28) 
include Denise McFayden, Shannon Quigley, Rick Harper and Tim 
Vallez. 

Even though Saturday's meet was supposd to be the last possible 
chance for UCSD track team members to qualify, Coach Mark 
Stanforth pointed out that possible meets in Santa Monica and at 
Cal State Northridge next weekend may give them one last chance. 

Still trying for a spot are pole vaulter Greg Ronlov and runners 
Kevin Carter and Merrel Hora . Hora' 14:45 .57 time in the 5,000-
meter race Saturday broke the chool record by 10 econds and was 
three second shy of the National qualifying time.
