The plan was proposed to the Revelle faculty by the college's Diego.

often duplicate studies of great works in different Humanities classes. 
Also, some works are left off individual reading lists, at the discretion of 
the professor. TAs are often unaware of the original idea of the program, 
that of imparting the knowledge of centuries of Western thought to the 
student in two years, with an emphasis on writing. 

With T A funds getting scarcer and workloads increasing, th amount of 
writing in the program has decreased. Often, courses require only one 
paper a quarter, and the emphasis is on concepts, not writing and style. 

In addition, it is becoming obvious to the committee that the high 
schools have not taught acceptable writing skills to many of its 
graduates. 

And if students don't learn to write in the Humanities program, they 
won't learn to write at all. 

Writing Program Crucial 
The committee felt too much change at one time might cause an 

upheaval that would hurt the program. It was decided to concentrate first 
011 writing. 

The Humanities segment will change little, with two lectures and one 
.rccitation scc~ion ~er week. In addition, there will be the writing 
laboratory. whIch WIl\ be taught by a different teaching assistant. 

For the first quarter, graduate students from the Department of 
I,iterature will teach the writing portion. Thereafter, qualified graduates 
from any department will give the instruction. . 

The laboratory will center on clear, expository writing on subjects 
relcvant to the current quarter of Humanities lectures. Students will 
write a minimum of 1500 words per quarter. 

One necessity of this plan is developing a certain level of proficiency 
among the faculty and teaching assistants in the subject. A. summer 
course was developed and held in the summer of 1975 in which the year 
was " preplanned." People involved met every day in a trial course, 
planning and preparing themselves to teach such courses. The program, 
funded on a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities was 
considered a success by the committee. ' 

F~nding for the proposed change is to come from monies currently 
a~allable for the Literature/E~glish 10 courses. Literature/English 10 
~Ill no longer be offered according to Avrum Stroll, faculty advisor to the 
Vice-chancellor of academic affairs. The committee also hopes that 
another grant will ?e forthcoming from the NEH, hopefully a major 
development grant 10 the range of $300,000-500,000. This pilot program, 
whcn completed and running smoothly, is hoped to be used as an example

Grobstein To Hire Officer 
To Promote UCSD Image 

by Vera M. I. Todorov 
Staff Writer 

Although UC San Diego is well 
known in the academic com-
munity, the campus is not well 
known in the " national mind" 
according to Vice-chancellor ~f 
University Relations Clifford 
Grobstein. 

To remedy this deficiency 
Grobstein plans to hire a senlo; 
public relations person, with ex-
perience in the national press 
corps. This new information offIcer 
will fill a post vacant since Cy 
Greaves retired last year. 

Grobstein feels there are many 
things worth publicizing at UCSD-
including research projects, the 
collegiate structure, visiting 
lecturers and the hiring of world-
renowned professors-becawse of 
the general Interest In scientific 
research and the liberal arts. 

No Football Team Blamed 
Grobstein blamed the campus' 

relative newness and lack of a 
football team for its paucity of 
national exposure. 

Although national publicity has 
been given to uam, notably as a 
result of the Nov. 25 demonstration 
against the CIA and the discovery 
of an general anti-allergen by 
faculty member Robert Ham-
burger, Grobstein feels the campus 
has not received enough national 
exposure. 

Grobeteln said the new in-
formation officer must have 
national media experience in order 
to Insure acceu to naUonal 
markets and publications. 

Additional national exposure 
may help U~D students get jobs 
upon graduation and increase 
private funding for the univ rsity, 
Grobstein said. 

Questioned by UC attorney 
Milton Gordon about the events 
that occurred during Saxon's walk 
from USB 2622 to Matthews 
campus, Bookman said he was 
pushed down on the bridge and was 
concerned for his health and 
safety. Bookman said he was 
concerned during the incident that 
the bridge might collapse since it 
was not build to hold 100 people 
jumping up and down." 

Bookman said that the students 
who linked arms caused the 
congestion on the bridge. He also

said it took "more than touching" 
for him to move the students who 
linked arms. 

Smiling and Talking 
Defense attorney Tom Bowden 

showed Bookman a series of 
photographs taken during Saxon's 

Student Center Director 
Mark Bookman (TT Photo : 
Tad Sperry) 
walk from the bridge to Matthews 
campus, which showed Saxon 

smiling and talking with students. 
The only photographs in which 

Saxon appeared to be upset were 
those taken as he tried to enter a 
police car on Matthews campus. 

Bookman said that Saxon's 
displeasure was probably caused 
by his inability to enter the back 
door of the car. Saxon had to be led 
around the car before he could get 
in. 

Bowden also showed Bookman a 
series of ohotographs of students 
linking arms in front of the crowd, 
none of whom were among the ten 
charged. 

The two hour hearing was lightly 
attended, with only three student 
spectators. Three of the charged 
students were present, after 

. resolving Friday night to boycott 
the hearings. Bowden was the only 
member of the defense present. ' 

Bowden requested that a 
separate verdict be made for each 
student on each of the charges 
against them : endangering 
Saxon's health and safety, im-
peding his movement and not 
following the directions of the 
University official. Lugannani 
directed the defense to prepare a 
brief on the dismissal of the 
charges by March 23. 

The hearings will reconvene 
AprilS at 10 am. 

Coop Action Center to 
Study SBPC Question 

by Ken Stipanov 
Staff Writer 

.The Student Cooperative avoided 
a major battle over the withdrawal 
of UC San Diego's representation 
on the Student Body Presidents 
Council (SBPC) Monday night by 
setting up an action center to study 
the question. 

The action center is charged with 
the broad role of examining the 
SBPC, UCSD's involvement on 
statewide committees, UC student 
gove rnment in general and 
alternatives to the present student 
government structure. 

The action center, which is open 

Researcher 
Â·Dies After 
Operation 

Paul Caldwell, the uc San 
Diego researcher who was in-
jured In a hangliding accident 
last week at Torrey Pines park, 
died last Sunday night from 
complications resulting from a 
second operation to repair his 
ruptured aorta. 

Before Caldwell died he used 
about 50 pints of blood. 

Friends close to the Caldwell 
family say it will be impossible 
for relatives and friends to 
completely refund the blood bank 
for what was u d and donations 
from the UCSD community are 
needed to repay the deficit. 

Blood should be donated in 
Caldwell's name to the San Diego

findings to the Coop and make 
proposals on which the Coop is to 
act. 

The Coop had been scheduled to 
make a concrete decision on with-
drawing from the SBPC at the 
meeting. 

No timetable was advanced for 
the completion of the action cen-
ter's study. 

Propaganda Collective Quizzed 
The Coop also discussed the 

responsibilities and actions of the 
Propaganda Collective action 
center. 

Mark Rapaport questioned 
whether the collective had been 
publicizing the activities of the 
Coop as it should. 

Collective members replied that 
they were publicizing meetings, 
but that they were over-extended 
because most of the members were 
involved in other action centers as 
well. 

BRG Inve tlgated 
The Coop briefly discussed the 

Student Registration Fee Com-
mittee investigation of the 
BudgeVResource Group (BRG) . 

Bob Simon, cochalnnan of the 
committee, said the conunittee is 
looking into how the BRG had

BOA Needs Students 
The Board of Authority needs applicants. 
The board was formed last month to provide for student control, in 

conjunction with director Mark Bookman, of the Student Center. It is an 
atlempt to allow more student control over their lives in the university. 
Among BOA's responsibilities will be budget planning, space allocation 
and personnel selection. 

An ad hoc committee, made up of representatives from the Student 
Cooperative, the Graduate Student Council and the student center staFf, 
will choose the BOA memberships. Members of the board will be 
rl'presentative of the same units. 

But the ad hoc committee needs people to make their selection from. U 
you think student control of the St~dent Center Is worthwhile, If you think 
student self-government is a worthy objective, then you should apply. U 
you are interested in making the Student Center responsive to student 
need, apply.

Letters to the Editor 

Open Letter to Anti-Cia Coalition 
We support the recent actions 

of the U~D community in ex-
posing and opposing the in-
volvement of the CIA at UC 
campuses. UC President Samn 
and the UCSD administration have 
consistently denied responsibility 
for and attempted to obscure the 
issues of CIA research contracts 
with professors and recruibnent 
programs at the University. This is 
unacceptable to us. 

We affirm the right of students to 
control their educational in-
stitutions, and the responsibility of 
students to act to prevent these 
institutions from implicit or ex-
plicit support or CIA activities such 
as : 1) creation and support of 
fascist regimes in Third World 
countries, 2) attempts to 
assassinate Third World leaders, 
3) sterilization programs to in-

Mud Slinging 
At Men 

I have heard enough mud-
slinging by you " liberated" women 
lately in the Triton Times to give us 
guys a castration complex. It 
seems logical to me, at least, that if 
you gals find the reporting and 
editing so objectionable, that you 
go out and submit your own 
columns of political news, sports, 
and other journalistic prose. I find 
it hard to believe that the "sexist", 
" male-cha vinist-domi na ted" 
editorial board would refuse a good 
story, even from a female. 

If you women, the vocal minority 
(and I do optimistically hope you 
are a minority), insist on blatantly 
criticizing the work of men without 
yourselves getting involved, then I 
dare say society is correct in 
retaining men to be the 'doers." 

Additionally, let me suggest that 
you firebrands take yourselves a 
bit less seriously. From the way 
you rant and rave, it sounds like 
women are b~ing deprived of equal 
opportunity. Incidentally, it's just 
as hard for a guy to enter a 
professional career as it is for a 

~irl (and many find it more dif-
fi cult because they are males. ) 

Finally, I wonder why "Big 
Sister" hasn't gwnption enough to 
expose her true identity.

Writer Takes Harder Look 
At Pre-Med Preparation 

This letter is written in response 
to the "Pre-Med Student Laum;" 
letter (TT, Feb. 'l1). Certain 
clarifications and additions must 
be made in order to present Scott 
Rubin's entire medical success 
story. 

Rubin failed to mention all the 
research he really didn't want to 
do, the smiles he had to throw at 
the right people, and the suspicion 
of people around him. The 
pre-medical student should not be 
deceived into beli.eving that 
medical schools are receptive to a 

non-science major without a 
science background. How many 
courses would it take for Scott 
Rubin to complete a biology 
major? I believe that a complete 
disclosure of Scott Rubin's 
biologjcaVmedical involvements 
and activities would seriously 
undermine his claim of acceptance 
due to a major in the social 
sciences. 

Lastly, Rubin's pri\ise of the pre-
med counseling service is biased, 
because Scott was accepted to a 
med school in January. 

JOELC. OON 

Mind Suppression 
It is unfortunate to see the 

tremendous degree of closemind-
edness still prevalent among the 
student population. Regardless of 
the issue, young opinions today are 
set far more firmly than those of 
even a half generation past. 
Creative radicalism is mocked, 
labels are far too frequently and 
easily thrown around. Any attempt 
to break down the artificial social 
conditioning that has been forced 
upon us as guilt is chided as either 
absurd or immature. 

Analyse the premise upon which 
you base those values which are so 
important to you. Restriction of 
individuality is the fundamental 

basis of that foundation supporting 
and producing your feelings of 
anti-self. Disregard the cultural 
fantasy imposed upon you as real 
and you are left with the essential 
being. The redirection of creative 
energy by society, that amorphous 
"THEY" that people refuse to 
acknowledge as themselves, eats 
away the potential for ad-
vancement. What are YOU doing 
to enjoy the paradise surrounding 
us. Break the chains of self 
restriction, the trivial rules and 
regulations of "it jilst isn't done." 
Perhaps then you may start to 
realize and actualize your potential 
being.

Wt'lluclldoy, March 10,1971 

TRB 

Same Time Last Year 
A year ago America's I6-year involvement in Vietnam 

cracked and crumbled. What is left are some young 
Americans in exile, a national mental blockage amounting to 
near psychosis and some behavioral quirks that would 
delight a psychiatrist: distrust of ourselves, alienation, a 
lassitude of will and a clutch of presidential candidates 
roam!ng the nation and warning against the federal govern-
ment. 

America's allies pray that we will snap out of it soon, using, 
perhaps, the standard therapy of such cases: reconstruction 
of the painful events, one by one, leading up to the blackout. 
"One year ago," munnurs the patient on the couch . "It 
seems like a century, an age!" It was only March 5,1975, 
however, that newspapers inconspicuously noted the start of 
the new North Vietnamese attack in the Central Highlands. 

It was the beginning of the end. Ford was "terribly 
disappointed" that Congress delayed $522 million sup-
plemental aid in the emergency. But a year ago the nation 
was fed up: Gallup reported 78 percent of the public opposed 
more aid; the House Democratic caucus voted 1119-49 against, 
it. 

The fall of the Lon Nol regime in Cambodia " could vitally 
affect the national security of the United States," Ford 
warned Congress on March 17. Such nonsense seems in-
credible a year later. But we had heard statements like that 
for years and, besides, South Vietnamese troops began 
abandoning provincial capitals, followed by hundreds of 
thousands of pitiful civilians. On March 20 last year, Ford 
linked the retreat to the uncertainty of US aid, and Defense 
Secretary Schlesinger charged " niggardly" support. 

Hue fell, the former imperial capital. W~shington tension 
grew. The New York Times unexpectedly declared on March 
21 that it would be " unconscionable" to cut off ammunition 
for Saigon, and it urged a three-year terminal aid program 
" to remove the Vietnam issue from next year's (1976 ) 
presidential election." The Communists removed it them-
selves. Americans on television watched South Vietnamese 

â¢ rl.oll '11J1('S 
troops fight civilians to get on thlast plane from Da Nang. 

Was that only last year? Silrely it must have been longer ! 
The climax came soon, but as always, with surprising 
details. Scoop Jackson told the Senate, April 8, that he was 
" reliably informed" that former President Nixon had ma de 
"secret agreements" with Saigon: Yes, said the White House 
the next day, but only to assure Saigon (in 1973 ) that the US 
would " react vigorously" to any violation of the pending 
cease-fire agreement. We wanted Thieu to come along, just 
as we had when Kissinger electrified the nation, just before 
the 1972 election, that "peace is at hand." 

The Communist advance rolled forward. Ford suddenly 
asked an evening joint session of Congress, April 10, for $722 
million more aid to help Saigon " save itself." Maybe this 
wasn't an effort to put the monkey on Congress' back but it 
looked like it. It was evident the end was near. The Pentagon 
estimated that $780 million of US-supplied arms had been lost 
in the retreat. 

Cambodia surrendered, April 10. That ended one US ad-
venture : an unprovoked and unconstitutional presidential 
war. It recalled the Christmas bombing of Hanoi and 
Haiphong, also ordered by Nixon without consultation. The 
bombing was too bad, State Department officials agreed 
later, because this most intensive bombing in history (2000 
strikes in 12 days) was not a military necessity; it was a 
sweetener to persuade Premier Thieu to come along with the 
cease-fire negotiations. 

Sa igon surrendered April 30. That ended 30 years of 
bloodshed. Thc war began as a na tive rebellion, led by Ho Chi 
Minh, to throw off French colonial rule . The US was half 
sympathetic at first but finally decided French mora le had to 
be bolstered. The US provided financial aid to France, and 
after she was thrown out began supplying military advise rs 
to the South in the Civil war that followed. Always there were 
two beliefs, first the belief that all undeveloped countries 
would love America if only they got to know us a nd second, 
the belief in monolithic Communism. It was as simple as 
that : good and bad. 

The first belief brought the classic peroration of Senator 

Pagel 

Ken Wherry in Missouri discuss ing China in the '405. " With 
God's h Ip we will lift Shanghai up . nd up - ever up, until it is 
just like Kansas City." 

And the other belief brought hardly less roma ntic ut-
terances: Secretary Dulles tha t we would make Laos a 
" bastion of the free world , " and Jack Kennedy tha t " the 
security of all Southeast Asia will be endangered if Laos loses 
its neutralist independence." 

We knew these things were true- until a year ago. 
" Probably the only people who have the historical sense of 
inevi table victory are the Americans," Englis h political 
scientis t Denis Brogan once wrote with awe. And so it was 
never understood in Washington, 'explained David Halber-
stam, that what was happening in Vietnam " was a 
revolutionary war, and that the other s ide held title to the 
revolution because of the colonial war which had just ended." 

Europeans watc hed Was hington and Saigon with equal 
curiosity a year ago. The Sunday Times (London ), April 6, 
saw " a pitiful lack of dignity" in Washington : "The 
President rails at Congress, as if a few million dollars could 
change the course of history." The Dally Telegraph decided 
that America's other alliances were safe: " The United States 
never at any time had the ' will to win' in Vietnam." 

The London Times summed it up - there were " two fla ws" 
in Ame d can policy [rom the first , it said: " one was the 
tendency to see the tentacles of a centrally-directed com-
munist conspiracy everywhere ... The other was the tendency 
to see the Amer ican polit ical system as the natural and 
universal goal of human endeavor." 

Exactly. And these myths departed a year ago as America 
lost its innocence and came of age. It happens to nearly 
everybody, soone r or later , but it is hard to face . It helps 
account for the d isillusionment and alienation of the election 
mood. F ord still a ttacks Congress : the other day he clllled it 
"gutless" about Angola. We sent 550,000 to Vietnam, but it is 
still ha rd to forgive Cuba for sending 10,000 to Angola. 
Congress is still to blame; we lost the Great Society and got 
inflation in the war ; some draft evaders are still in exile 
wishing they had a pardon like Nixon, and the thing cost the 
US $170 bi llion and 55,000 lives. It ended a year ago.

Finally the tea being cold she's working on the work for tomorrow 
running back and forth once in a while a comment caught on the run. 

Seeing things too clearly yu might put some meat into an understanding 
the threads that connect severing for at least a while. In that while the 
gaps. Keep thinking there's someone that yu are but i'm there with that 
other so the dream all comes true. 

Bernadette defends her dishes in suitcases bolted to the living room 
floor. 

Something saying for a way perhaps on the cany~n wall becky cries 
through someone i'm gonna ' tell this all too but she's knowing now doing 
the dishes. 

There are. things more valuable than sleep when you are up against the 
wall punching without any bags or gloves and every stroke has to count. 
This no longer gets literary or dream like it no longer imagined no way of 
a definition this is love that can be touched and tasted its problems only 
shining on its bright manuscript. Every cut from now on a johnna be with 
precursor fine honed precision with sharpness as the guiding edge. And 
the end issues is moving towards an end result envisioned long before 
Blake laid the foundation. 

Renedgade in a bush lasted about 25 years more. When death stares yu 
in the face work becomes so clear. Read about Skelton. 

So the next morning here i am hitchhik ing in sm after being thrown out 
of court for an offense not committed only wished committed the valley 
here opens up into the sky and the pasture across the highway smells like 
a pasture. With dew clear in contrast to these subdivisions sitting in 
waiting to thumb a ride. 

A dairy truck makes a left past MY vantage point while grey clouds 
drifts on in from the coast. Smells together for rain but fuck this is 
California and it hasn't rained but for yesterday. 

Noises from the house next door drown the silence preceeding the 
. beating from the green house, dark in the slenders of Santana off a stereo 
and a big front tree. In bed with another man 's woman is such a crock of 
shit. Egg truck passes by. ' 

This other house here has chickends. The one behind me a yellow . 
Mazda. The lady in there called the cops. It is the depths of the suburbs. 
All the rabbitts pass by. 

Forty more years we got at the most so let the chains rattle and belch 
doors slam and parking benches be set with a boom. Crapped cropped 
hair in the movies as the wind shield roar by cropped hair in the wind-
shields as the movie roars by. There's a knock at the door hours earlier its 
a german accent man looking for Gonzalez. Turns out to be the new next 
door neighbor aren't the old ones enough she let me use the phone, said

San Diegans Plan Walk For Disarmament 
The San Diego segment of the 

national Walk for Disarmament 
will begin Friday morning with a 
trek from the Mexican border to 
the Naval Administration Building 
in downtown San Diego. 

The walk, which begins at 9 am 
a t the San Ysidro border 
monwnent on Dairy Mart Rd., is 
coordinated with the Continental 
Walk for Disarmament and Social 
.Justice, which started in San 
Francisco Jan. 31 and is scheduled 
to end at the Pentagon in October. 

Education About Nonviolence 
The walk, according to local 

organizers, is " in recognition of the 
need for education about non-
violent resistance as a means 
superior to annaments in defense, 
to raise the issue of disarmament 
and to demonstrate how global and 
domestic economic problems are 
interconnected with militarism. " 

Groups sponsoring the walk 
include the American Friends 
Service Committee, and Catholic 
Peace Fellowship, the Gray 
Panthers, the National CoWlcil for 
Universal Unconditional Amnesty, 
the Southern Christian Leadership 
Council, the Socialist Party, the 
Women's International League for 

Peace and Freedom and the War 
Resisters League. 

Local participants plan to walk 
eight miles Friday and spend the 
night in a church in Chula Vista. 
Saturday morning they will con-
tinue the remaining eight miles to 
the naval building. 

Sunday morning a motorcade 
will transport walkers to River-
side, where they will join the main 
walk at a rally and picnic. 

Two meetings concerning the 
walk, a benefit and a planning 
session, have been held in recent 
weeks. Monday night at San Diego 
State's Aztec Center potential 
walkers were instructed in non-
violent discipline. 

Last Monday night Daniel 
Ellsberg spoke to over 400 spec-
tators at a benefit for the walk on 
the SDSU campus. 

Gregory&ndoff 
EIlsberg also took part in the 

opening stages of the walk in San 
Francisco, which saw a reported 
1000 people sent off by Dick 
Gregory, who said, "Anyone who 
walks across the country in the jet 
age is depending on spirtual 
power." 

Local organizer Debbie Tippin, 

Buy.cente 
t 

an SDSU student, sees the walk as 
an excellent way to present the 
case for disarmament to the 
people. 

"The simple action of walking 
symbolizes that great goals are 
reached slowly, and that fun-
damental change must begin in our 
neighborhoods where the issues 
are discussed," Tippin said.

Bad Company--Forgettable; Pretty Things--

Not Too; Sweet--Teeny-Boppish 
by Alex Bennett 

StaHWriter 
Run With The Pack - Bad Com-
pany. Swan Song. 

This la Bad Company's third 
albollD. In it, they remain true to 
(heir commibnent to gutsy, down-
to-earth rock-n-roll. Afficionados 
of HItS-style rock should enjoy the 
strong and honest simplicity that is 
found throughout the album. 

Paul Rodgers' brisk vocals and 
Mick Ralphs' biting guitar 
dominate the albwn. They also 
wrote most of the songs, some of 
which reveal their softer sides 
(l ike " Love Me Somebody") 
without sacrificing their rock 
foundation. 

Despite the album's consistency, 
there are few songs that really 
stand out. It is as though they felt 
that it was enough that the music 
was rock, and did not need to be 
made more exciting. 

Savage Eve - Pretty Things. Swan 
Song. 

The Pretty Things ' have been 
around since 1964. Rolling Stone 
called them "a seminal influence 
in British rock ." Other critics and 
stars have also expressed ad-
miration for them. No, I had not 
heard ofthem before either. 

If their latest album is a 
reflection of their seminal in-
fluence, then perhaps it is in the 
sense that it represents rock's 
lowest common denominator. This 
might be too harsh, but in the face 
of such hype, one expects 
something more than "Savage 
Eye" delivers. 

The Pretty Things have suc-
ceeded in slickly combining many 
disparate elements of rock music. 
The nwnbers range from rowdy 
tunes with an accented beat to 
excursions into the Crosby Stills & 
Nash kind of spirituality. The 
problem is that they have not 
achieved anything beyond the grist 
they were working with. The music 

sounds either empty or like so 
many other songs. One senses at 
times an artistic vision , but it is 
never developed into a distinctive 
expression. 

Give Us A Wink-Sweet. Capitol. 
Sweet is mainly known for their 

AM hit " Fox on the Run II a 
beautifully sexist hard-r~ker. 
They are members of the genre 
that includes such groups as Kiss 
and Blue Oyster Cult ; their music 
is characterized by a relentlessly 
pounding beat. Their appeal seems 
to be more towards the teeny-
bopper audience, as a look at the 
tastefully juv~nile cover of the 
album would indicate. 

Some might consider the music 
ins ide to be tastelessly juvenile as 
well, but it does have a real appeal 
when one is in the right (i.e., 
rowdy) mood. It has a consistently 
strong, fast-paced beat that carries 
the listener solidly and smoothly 
through the songs: what m y friend 

Continued on Page ~ 
The only song that really sticks 

in the mind is the title track, " Run 
With The Pack." Many of the 
others tend to be forgotten once 
they are over. The result is that 
unless you are especially ' in-
terested in this sort of music, the 
album is likely to seem pleasant 
but nondescript. 

Two One-Act Plays Set 
Â·Two new one-act plays by 

Michele Tikhonoff, a graduate 
student in the UC San Diego drama 

Writing Lab .... 
for other universities which are attempting to change their writing 
program. The committee emphasizes that this program is not a remedial 
program. It is designed to improve students' skills and writing style. 
Every student would have the chance to improve his writing in such a 
situation . 

Reactions Varied 
Reaction to the program is varied. David Crowne chairman of the 

committee, emphasizes the need for a program such as this, as does 
Stroll. Alden Mosshammer, chairman of the Hwnanities committee 
declined to comment. ' 

In an informal poll conducted on the Revelle plaza, reactions were also 
mixed. A majority of those polled were against the new program. Such 
comments as "We have enough work already," " that's the job of the high 
schools," "We already have the same thing: LiVIO, and why bother?" 
were common. 

Those in favor of the program saw a need for a writing program; some 
people felt that the program would add grea te r de pth to the current 
lIumanities sequcnce. The Revelle faculty was overwhelmingly in favor 
of the new program. 

department, will open in the UCSD 
Studio Theatre, MC 409, at 8 pm 
Friday. 

The first play, "Jacks," deals 
with both the positive and the 
negative aspects of jealousy and 
possessive love. The director, 
Benny Sato Ambush, is also a 
graduate student in the depart-
ment and has previously worked 
throughout New England_ 

The second play , " Dover 
Beach," presents its audience with 
original insights into the nature of 
maturing feminine consciousness 
in a society that has only recently 
recognized women as having 
minds as complex as men's. 
" Dover Beach" is directed by Tom 
Reynolds, a graduate director with 
pl'evious experience at UC Santa 
Barbara. 

The plays will be repeated at 8 
pm Saturday and Sunday.

THE THRILL 

~ ITZ 
I by STEVE ESM EDNA 

The State of Rock Cri ticism 
In the current issue of "Rollin~ Stone,"critic-columnist Jon Landau 
bo~s out tearfully from rock criticism. His reasons are various : he's 
1.!0 J ~g to concentrate on record production (searching for new 
Sprmgstecns no doubt, ) he needs a vacatioll from deadlines; but mostly 
h . belie~es that rock writing is in an aesthetic vacuum. He cites the lyric' 
ol'lentatton of most rock reviewers, noting how too many of the reviews of 
Pa ul Simon's "Still Crazy After All These Years" concentrated on the 
litcral level of the record while ignoring the eclectic musical structure. 

Landau's allegations are valid enough, but what he fails to deal with at 
Icngth is that he is one of the prime offe nders in this regard. Any critic 
who can make an a morphous pronouncement that an artist as rooted in 
J'ock and roll readymades as Bruce Springsteen is " the rock and roll 
fu ture" and never explain it in aesthet ically reasonable terms should be 
the last to complain a bout the lack of crit ical substance. 
. Anyway, i.n vie.w of Landau 's writing in the last two years, I say good 

riddance, big shit a nd small stakes. I suspect that rock criticism will 
function with or without him. 

~t's funny. In 1967-68, when rock criticism was in its fledgling stages, its 
primary function was to argue for the Art of rock music. Journals like 
"Rolling Stone," "Crawdaddy," "Fusion," "Eye," and books such as 
Richard Meltzer's " The Aesthetics of Rock," Richard Goldstein's 
"Greatest H!ts" and Pa ul W.illiam's "Outla wBlues" took deliberate steps 
to put rock mto an aesthetic framework on par with what "Sight And 
Sound" and "Cahiers Du Cinema" did for movies. These attempts, while 
often pretentious (Meltzer) and naive (Williams), were exhilarating in 
their selfless seriousness. 

From this first wave of " rock-as-art" came a number o[ excellent 
young wl'iters whose sensibilities undoubtedly encouraged the rock 

re~aissance ?[ the late sixties. Robert Christgau, Lester Bangs, Langdon 
Wmner,. C?rell ~arcus and even Jon La ndau were outstanding critics, 
each writing With sharp aesthetic, technical and sociological tools. What 
most distinguished these writers was their willingness to m eet their 
subjects straight-on, deal with them at length, and to open up the works, 
not to simply trumpet the'm haphazardly or dump on them smugly . 

To see how these critical ideals have been shoved under the record rack 
a quick glance at some of last year's most renowned records is in-
structiona l : Bruce Springsteen's "Born To Run," The Who's "By 

umbers, to Neil Young's "Tonight's The Night" and Â·Â·Zuma. " All of these 
records, and more like them, are by my ear , terrible. Springsteen's is 
b labored myth-mongering, The Who's is a moribund exercise in rock 
star ~c1f-pity , and Young's are ragged. wretched, boringly formless 
confessions of depression. 

[f one takes the reviews ser iously without fir st listening to the records, 
he learns that Springsteen is a " tough, operatic consciousness who puts 
rock's rebel precepts into an aesthetic." Uh-uh. What he is is an un-
mitigatcd blend of Del Shannon a nd Conrad Birdie who sings everything 
with the same bogus urgency that threate ns eventually to give Bruce a 
severe case of laryngitis. This is a "seventies consciou ' ness? The future 
of rock and roJJ? " Hmm. A more appropria te monicker would be the 
.. Fonzie of rock and roll." 

The Who's " By Numbers" and Neil Young's twin sob stories have been 
applauded for thei r " searing honesty and candor." Never mind the fact 
that they are all melodically barren, rhythmica lly retarded, and so un-

Snaring Snakes 
It was morning. I had just finished some tea and a newspaper for 

brelOk'ast. I was walking across my estate, between the first and second 
hOuse, when I saw it lying in front of me. 

I jwnped away. I am not always a brave man. But, of course, I crept 
back for another look. It did not move, but it was alive. 

I hurried to the telephone. 
"Peter," I said, "gopher snakes don't have triangular-shaped heads, do 

they?" 
Silence. Peter had just gotten out of bed. He is a workingman and it was 

a weekend. "No," he finally answered. "Why? What's up?" 
"Rat' ler!" 
"I'll be right over." Click. 

â¢â¢â¢â¢ 
Now, I'm no hunter. U's a dead-or at least dying-sport from another 

age. Maybe if I had been raised in Outer Mongolia, or Michigan, I would 
see things differently. 

But looking out in the evening over the few acres of greenery I have 
retained from the developing La Jolla landscape, and watching the foxes 
and squirrels and rabbits and quail that come into my yard, I usually 
cannot see any reason for killing them. 

I will confess that I am in the middle of some rather vicious un-
derground warfare with the resident gophers. I do not grow vegetables 
for them. And I go fishing because it helps satisfy the needs I have inside 
of me in a variety of places below my shoulders and above my knees. But, 
basically, I do not have much to do with hunting. 

However, when my life is threatened .... 
â¢â¢â¢â¢ 

Peter majored in biology and cuts open cats in a lab so I figured he 
would be a good partner in the hunt. Even though he forgot to wear his 
shoes when he came over, I had confidence in him because after he saw 
the snake he said, "We're gonna need some special equipment. " I have a 
lot of faith in special equipment guys. 

We fashioned a forked snake-stick out of some baling wire and a piece 
of green bamboo we found in the tool shed. I also picked up a long, pointed 
~take. You never know. 

We went back to the snake, but it was gone. 
" Damn," said Peter. "I want to get him. I've never caught a rat-

tlesnake before." 
I have never caught Parkinson's disease either, I thought to myself. 

But this was a deadly creature in our midst so I said, "Maybe it's under 
that planter. I'll lift it up and you look underneath." 

When I raised up one end of the wooden box Peter said quietly, "There 
hc is." Peter reached out with the weapon towards the snake. I could see 
the dangerous reptile. It was at least 12 inches long. It looked angry. 
Fierce. Wild. It had two nubs on the end of its tail that I think would have 

- been a rattle if the snake were not so little. I had hear that the smaller the 
rattlesnake, the deadlier its bite, so I was glad to be holding up the planter 
box instead of doing battle. 

The fork We had made for the snake-stick was too big to hold the little 
demon. So Peter reached down with his hand and picked up the snake

is trying to do. 

Sweet Harmony - Marta M ...... ur. 
Reprise. 

Maria Muldaur's new album 
offers a variety of differert moods, 
ranging from hooky-tonk to 
nightclub to mellow. Her beautiful, 

â¢ n. .... IIIII'S 

delicate voice adapts itself weD to 
each song, adding delightful 
nuances. For one who is not close 
to her music, I found it quite 
pleasurable and interesting 
listening. 

Of special interest were the sch-
maltzy songs that affected a 
nightclub atmosphere, These could 
have come off as ridiculous, but 
Muldaur put her voice into it, so 
that the SOI1lS were enhanced by 
all the little conceits she added. 
Also, the extensive instnunental 
backing increased the effect.

nasty-looking fangs. Its mouth was open wide enough to swallow at least a 
~ood - sized stink bug. 

I was impressed. 
Peter put the live snake into an aquariwn filled with dirt that I had once 

used to keep a praying mantis in. Peter was shaking slightly. The only 
thing I could think to do was olfer him a beer even though I did not have 
any. I knew he would not want ' one anyway since it was early in the 
morning. He did not, but it was the thought that counted. 

Peter took the rattlesnake home.

From such an exciting adventure, I have gained ~ new appreciation for 
the sport of hunting. There we were, pitted against a sheer, brute, natural 
force. Life and Death was riding on the outcome of the perilous struggle. 
And I think I felt something in the area below my shoulders and above my 
knees. 

I still cannot see myseH becoming much of a hunting entJlI~iast. Not in 
this time and place. But, last night, I did set out an extra gopher trap. 

Rock Critics . . . 
disguised in their woe-are-we sentiments that they arE.: simply unbearable 
to listen to past the cursory stage. 

What are we supposed to get from The Who's " we're geUin' too old to 
be doing this" crying towel? I say hang 'it up. What are we supposed to 
gather from Young's declaration that he's " stealing tunes from the 
Rolling Stones" because he's " too wasted" to write his own? Aw shucks 
Neil, ain't that a shame. Next time, stop off at your analyst's office on the 
way to the studio . 

I realize I am being glib here, but I see no other alternative when horrid 
albums such as these are treated upon arrival as gifts from above. There 
are a nwnber of excellent rock artists-Roxy Music, Eno, Little Feat, 
Robert Fripp, JOM Cale, Sadistic Mika Band, and others-who deserve as 
much (more) textural analysis as fops like Springsteen have gotten. My 
question is simple : because an artist such as Bruce, Pete, Neil, Elton, 
J oni, Bob, or whomever says " I am in this state of mind" is that sufficient 
reason to give their music a go-ahead? Wouldn't it be beUer if their ar-
tistic personnas had some levels of psychological, musical , or aesthetic 
depth? And whatever happened to musical competence as a criterion? 

When I read recent rock criticism, I can think of these questions and 
nothing else.
