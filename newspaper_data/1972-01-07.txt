The artisticall,v gifted group is well 
known in the Chicano movement. The 
Ballet Folklorico, in its stage 
performances, combines traditional 
Mexican cultural themes along with 
additions of the modern Chicano 
experience, In addition to their 
recognition within the Chicano 
movement. the group has received 
positive acclamations and reviews 
when performing before other cultural 
groups . 

The two Azteca is a musical group 
from the neighboring cit~' of Tijuana . 
Their repertoire consists of the 
traditional Mexican bolero. The songs 
which come from their Spanish guitars 
are reminiscent of one of Mexico's 
most famous groups, Los Panchos. 

Due to the lack of organizational help 
only ISO tickets are on sale. The\' can

MOSCA members have extended 
their warm invitation to all UCSD 
students and hope man~' will attend, 

should not run the niversitv ot 
California . " the Unlversitv can't run 
without the taxpayers " . 

Taxpayers Should Not Interfere 

He does not leel il IS proper for a 
taxpayer to directly tnterf ere 10 the 
daily operation of the Rlversitv , Last 
spring. Mr. Steven Balkam. · a San 
Diego stockbrokcr . attempted twice to 
tear down a Viet Cong flag from a 
Physics graduate student's office on 
campu s. Higgs cites this incident as 
one of Improp r interference in UC 
op rations. , 

Higgs feels there should be academic 
freedom on a college campus, There 
should be a free exchange of all idcas 
and Higgs does not feel that he must 
agree with all 01 them . However . he 
clearly dlfferenl1ates between a 
proles or VOICing oppOSition to an issue 
and a professor urging vlolenl 
opposition The latter. Hlgl!~ states. IS 
not academic freedom 

Due to hiS prOXimity to UCSD. Higgs 
IS well informed on many Issues. Hc 
voted for Third College when it was 
onginally presented tu the board for 
approval a nd he " c,)minues to support 
It " The college has Its problems, he 
leels. and there ha ve be'n a lot of 
misunderstandings about it. however 
he is ' In tavor 01 Its baS IC cune pt~ "

Possibilities 
Dancer's Workshop 

San Francisco DaD ers' 
Workshop is now scheduling 
auditons for a new Community 
Workshop led by Ann Halprin 
and beginning Jan. 10. In order 
to maintain a cultural balance 
in the community some 
scholarships are available for 
Blacks, Asians, and Chicanos. 
The workshop will meet 
Monday/ Wednesday/ Friday 
from 2 lo 6 p.m. Dancers' 
Workshop is at 321 Divisadero, 
San Francisco, phone : 626.{)414. 

In relation to the content of 
the workshop, Miss Halprin 
noted, "We will be working on 
rituals that come out of the 

here-and-now situation of a 
group in the process of 
becoming a community. The 
£irst weeks will be concerned 
with a total involvement in 
movement . Through the 
movement experience we will 
gel in touch with the content of 
our group and begin to find 
ways to ritualize our conflicts 
and loves as we begin to realize 
our community . We will 
complete our experiences by 
taking our rituals inlo the 
broader community in which 
we live . Throughout the 
workshop our overall purpose 
will be to recognize that each 
community is its own art. "

UC Regents vs Pepper Canyon 
by j ohn Demirj ian 

There have beelllllauy words that have passed before me as I 
have read of the Pepper Canyon School .of the Le.armng 
Community here at the University of Califorma at San i?lego: 
In a memo out of the Office of the President of the UmvefSlty 
dated July 8, 1971 , came the recommendation from President 
Hitch that. .. 

" ... continuation of an elementary school on the 
San Diego campus operated by th~ L~armng 
Community. a registered student orgamzahon. and 
supervised by the Office of the Vice Cha~cellor for 
Student Affairs be approved for a pertod not to 
exceed two years, subject to agreements bet~een 
the Learning Community and the San Diego 
campus administration whi h are a~,ceptable to the 
President and the General Counsel. 

This recommendation followed a proposal which carried 
With It the endorsements of Acting Chancellor Herbert York . 
Revelle Provost Paul Saltman and Vice Chancellor for Stu.dent 
Affairs George Murphy. The new propo al a~sured a direct 
relationshIp between the school and the off!ce of the vice 
chancellor for student affa irs. thus prov ldmg deSirable 
measures of supervision and control. This relationsh!~ would 
have permitted several campus departments to utlhze the 
chool as a practicum experience for theIr candidates for the 

Caltfornla tf'achin~ credenllal. thu assuring nece sary 
educatIOnal sub tance to the program and effective means of 

on~omg program evaluatIon 
The proposal was well balanced with rational!tv and 

po esslOn of sound rea on The Learntng Community IS a 
registered student or~aOlzalion on the an Diego campus With 
member hlp ltmlted to students. raculty and staff of the 
Cnlversitv . Consistent with the nature of a rommuOity school. 
many of the members of the Learmng Community were 
parent of children in the school It has been supported

dimensions of UCSD out of existence. . 
I personally consider it an asinine move unique. t~ the 

bureaucracy that has remained so .• well and alive Within l.tS 
rigid hierarchy. The people concerned with Pepper Canyon WI\l 
wonder perhaps why the children of the school must be 
deprived of true academic freedom because some other 
persons failed to see the priceless value of the bea.uty mherent 
in the atmosphere of what was offered. Chlidren wer~ 
permitted to transcend the de~oralizing "educatl.onal ~ystem 
that is so dominant in our society, and get to gnps With what 
education really was. 

In order to assure that academic substance woul~ ~e the!'e . 
the Learning Community and the campus admlOlstratlon 
jointly proposed a formal relationship between the school and 
the Office of Gc?rge S. Murphy . In addition to provldtng direct 
University.Learning Community supervIsion and control of the 
school an'd maintaining the financial integnty of the school. 
that relationship would have provided the means.of maktng the 
school available to the several departments which planned to 
utilize it for practicum work for students seekl~g th 
California teaching credential. The Departments of SOCiology. 
biology. literature and mathematics, among others. appeared 
as those most immediately involved . The scho~l was also 
utilized by San Diego State Co\1ege and Untted tates 
International University. The latter even hoped to contlOu.e 
uti li zing Pepper Canyon for teacher practlcum purposes as It 
did this past academic year . But it looks as If such hopes must 
now be cast to those winds that bureaucracy does command . 

I am sorrv for what the people involved in Pepp~r Canyon 
School have 'lost and for what the Regents of the Umverslty of 
Ca lifornia have killed in thei r supreme arrogance. Perhap~.

16 Matches 

Swordsmen On Streak 
Mark Liska 

"One of the teams to beat 
this year will be UCSD.' Yes, 
fans. it's true, UCSD is gaining 
fame . fortune and glory in the 
sports world, though many of 
you don ' t realize this . 
Consider : what UCSD varsity 
squad has a 16, that IS right, a 
16-game winning streak going? 
What team won 10 straight last 
year to finish second in the 
stage, placing being UCLA, 
perenn ial power? What team is

USC, Long Beach State and 
other major powers? What 
team was the only team to 
upset UCLA last year? Yes. 
sports fans, UCSD is a power, a 
strong power. in the fencing 
world. 

The season has already 
started for the team. and it 
started in usual winning style.

Ruggers Win Tournament 
Over Christmas Vacation 

The Triton Rugby Club did outstandingly 
well over the holidays in two 7' Aside 
tournaments. The club took its teams to the 
San Fernando Tournament on Dec. 11. 

The first team was unbeaten in four games 
and challenged only twice, in the first game 
where they had the "freeway doldrums" and 
had to go into overtime to beat the Long Beach 
R C . 8-4 . The winning try came off a kick 
ftelded by Kang Beanan , passed to Gates and 
then to Sertic. who tantilized the last defender 
With a series of false passes before giving the 
ball to Paul Liebow. who went in for the 
score. 

The l's then breezed over Loyola and UCLA, 
II\. 24-0 and 22·0 before meeting host San 
Fernando Valley State for the championship. 
ThiS was a hard-fought game . with SF leading 
6·4 .... Ith one minute to go when Dick Duncan 
broke for a 6O-yards run for a score. which pu t 
the Trttons ahead with no time left on the lock. 
The .... hole first team of D.Beanan. B. Gates. 
R OToole. P Sertic. J . Ringwood. D. Duncan 
and P Liebow played extremely well . 

The UCSD II's and Ill 's wound up with 2-2 
records in their division . The II's were led by 
the sco ring of Jeff Wostman and Jim "The 
Ankle Man " Viglienzone. in victories over 
Bakersf ield and Harvard . The most 
s~eclacu l a r show, however. was put on by the 
II,. With a "Drunken " Waasdorp. twisting 

runs by Frank "Gyro" Barnes. and timely 
scoring by Kaplan, Haber and Lance De Long. 

Wah one trophy under their belts. the ('s. 
with the addition of Waasdorp. Dick Ostrup 
and George Clinton , went to the All-Cal 
tournament at UCLA the next week. UCSD 
eaSily handled UCR 18'{). Irvine 14-0. Cal 
Lutheran 24-6 and Santa Cruz 18-10. The big 
tests were against UCLA I and UCLA I l. 
teams of equal caliber . 

The fir st game was against UCLA I. and the 
Tritons had them on the ropes during the fi rst 
half. but were unable to score due to another 
set of "freeway hands." UCLA came back in 
the second half to win 18-0. Against the CLA 
II's the Tritons led at the half 9-0 on a trv bv 
Ringwood and a penalty and conversion by 
Bates. In the second half UCLA came back 
with a try and with one minute to go UCSD led 
9-6 : however. UCLA managed to pull it out l0-9 
with a tr.v Dick Duncan . Doug Beanan and 
John Ringwood were named to the AII-
Tournament team and all other were equally 
deserving. 

This weekend the Triton take on sa me of 
the best teams in the nation at the San Diego 
Tournament be ing held at Robb Field . Ocean

Tritons Win Big 
Mo rk Young 

Christmas came a little bit late for the lCSD basketball 
team th is year. as they were presented with an 88·45 vlctorv 
over the visitors from PaCifiC ChTlSllan Before a rowdv crowd 
Tuesday night. the Tritons unwrapped. embarrassed and 
virtually undressed the haples opposing players. who 
managed to show up for the game The WIO was the most 
Impressive margin of victor\, In this verv voung season and 
left UCSD with a 3-4 record and smllmg faces 

The outcome was never In any real doubt as the TCIlons 
jumped out to a 10-point lead before five minutes had elpa ed 
on the scoreboard From there on. the cOring of Dave Wright 
and Jon Lelevler. With the rebounding of Scott Wright . Paul 
Trainer . and Pete Henderson . was enough to add to the earl~' 
lead . The score at ha lftime saw the Tntons holding a 20,polnt 
lead . 38·18 

The second half proved to be Identical to the first. The qUick 
hands of the UCSD guards forced many turnovers. which 
resulted in easy lay-ups. ThiS. plus the fine board work . proved 
too much for the chagnned factIOn from PaCIfic Christian 
Final stalistics showed the Tritons sconng 50 pomts In the 
second half as compared With the opponents' 'lI Dave Wnght 
led a\l scorers With 18 potnt . while Tom HarkinS tallied 14 for 
the losers The real edge. however. was In rebound L'CSD 
managed 61 rebound . as compared to PaCific Chnstlan s 2; It 
looks like Coach Cunningham must have fed the team a little 
ra w meat before the game. because the~' looked ml~hty mean 

The victory . however. did not belong solely to the startln~ 
five In fact , the most crUCial bucket of the game came on a 
free throw b:.· reserve center Al Woodward wtth three seconds

with our low air fares. flying PSA isn't a whole lot

your thumb in the phone instead, and dial us for 
a reservation?
