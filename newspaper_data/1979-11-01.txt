Hall. 

The 65 pound San Diego 
Wild Animal Park-donated 
pumpkin carried with it 40 
pounds of candy.

AS Argues Over 
Continuing Daily 
Guardi'an Ads 
. 

By Ri .. Lee Podolsky 
Staff Writer . 

One AS Commissioner said that advertising in the Dail" 
Guardian made him "sick" while AS President Carlos Montalvo 
contended that it was a "good deal," as the council debated last 
night whether to discontinue all advertising in the newspaper. 

Two proposals were submitted regarding Guardian ad money. 
The first, proposed by Activities Commissioner Bill T opkia, 
Appointments and Evlautions Commissioner Brad Barham, 
Warren College Representative Jan Breslauer, would freeze a 
AS and AS sponsored organizations advertising in the 
Guardian. It would use the money to distribute AS Bulletin Board 
flyers around campus. 

The second proposal, from Montalvo, urged the continuance of 
AS advertising, but left open the possibilities of flyers and 
advertisements in alternative media. Montalvo's proposal would 
give the AS a $10,000 contract with the Guardian. 

He points out that last year the AS spent $1 7,000 in 
advertising, while his proposal would "let student organizations 

advertise, they'd get more 
pages than la t year, and it 
would be cheaper." 

T opkis said. "The idea of 
the AS subsidizing the 
Guardian for $1 0,000 sickens 

" me. 
While proponents of cutting 

off Guardian ads said they 
would do so because the paper 
was no longer an effective way 
to reach students, several AS 
members admit that the AS 
has not been very happy 
recently about the Guardian's 
news coverage. 

Linda Sabo, Commissioner 
of External Affairs, said, 
"There are more reasons for 
this bill than are being 
outwardly discussed. You 
don't cut funds for advertising 
if what you're really upset with 
is the news reporting, 
editorials, and editorial 
policy." She calls the Topkis 
bill a "drastic, drastic bill." 

Even Breslauer admits that

Halley's CODlet Will 
Be Seen Up Close 

By Ed Barenthin 
The 1986 return of Halley' Cornel will give the UCSD 

Chemistry Dept. a unique opportunity to learn about the nature of 
comets and the origins of the solar system. 

The UCSD staff is developing an instrument for the NASA 
probe that will pass Halley's Comet and later, in 1988, 
rendezvous with Tempel-2, a sm~lIer and less active comet that 
returns once every five years. 

"We really know almost nothing about comets . they' re just a 
'dot in your eye ' even through a tele cope," says Dr. James 
Arnold, professor of chemistry. 

"The tail and the other spectacular visual display are just dust 
and gas particles blown off the surface by solar radiation," say 
Arnold. "The 'core' is a complete unknown: one theory has'it that 
they are a conglomerate of rock and ice, but we aren't even sure of 
their sizes. Tempel-2, even though a very well·studied comet, is 
probably about the size of La Jolla, but then it could be as large as 
10 miles in diameter or as small as half a mile." 

The instrument under development is a gamma-ray 
spectrometer. physically a 100 cc lump of germanium (a semi-
conductor material often used in transistors) which produces an 
electrical pulse every time it is struck by one of the high-energy 
rays. 

Originally developed for cosmic ray study, its use on the 
mission will be to measure the spectra emitted by the surface of the 
comet's core under cosmic ray bombardment. After being 
converted to a number and transmitted back to earth, the 
amplitudes of the pulses are summed to produce a spectrum of the 
surface (to a depth of 30 centimeters) and so tell what it is made 
of.

Christianity Solves Guilt 
Editor: 

I am writing ~ response to 
Ted Burlce'. ~tive review 
(Oct. 24) of Bob lJylan'slatett 
album, Slow Train Cominll, 
not because I'm etpecially 
fond 01 this album or even of 
Bob Dylan's music in general. 
I'm writing in response to the 
bad review Christianity got in 
this article; I'd like to offer a 
diHerent perapective. 

Burke objects to the 
~r~"of"the 

~orn.again variety" on 
Dylan'. a1bum~ He complain. 
that the menage communi-
cated by the album, in a void 
01 artistic merit, is a message

of Catholic school. " A. a 
reauIt of the . "propaganda" 
they received, he and his 
daumates, "grew up with 

• guilt complexes that wouldn't 
quit." He says that the album 
i. "pu.hy, preachy, 
dualistically apocalyptic 
and ... arrogant." Burke 
compares Dylan to "evangeli-
cal chest thumpeu" in 
presuming "he can wipe 
everyone else's (slate) clean." 

I can't answer for nuna, 
priesta, "evanselical chest 
thumper." or Bob Dylan. I 
think that beyond the personal 
lIaw. of theae individuals, 
however, there is something 

.more buic: in Burke's reaction 
to Christianity. He refer. to the 

",uilt complexes" that were 
brought on by the Christian 

. "propalJanda" he W81 exposed 
to. I don't believe that any 
human being can instill guilt in 
another. Who can say that he 
has never felt guilty?

rationalize it. lbe more it is 
ignored the less it will trouble 
you on a daily basi •. 

I think one thing that turns 
many people oH to Christianity 
i. the thought that there i. a 
holy God with holy atandarda 
againat which we can be 
judl(ed and found failing. In 
luch a .y.tem there ia no 
provi.ion for rationalizing ' 
guilt. I have often heard people 
refer to Christianity 81 a 
religion which forces guilt 
feelings on its followers . But it 
is actually the only religion 
that offers a true solution to the 
problem .of ,uiIt. 

God wanta to (orgive each 
of us because our guiltiness 
alienates us from Him. He of·

incurred. He wanta us to 
experience His love for UH. He 
wanta us to know Him, for 
then and only then, will we be 
truly happy and fulfilled. 

But these things caMot 
happen as long ' as we are 
alienated from God, as long all 
we refuse to admit our own 
guilt and accept God's gift of 
forgiveness and a new ~fe 
through and in Jesus Christ. 
God is anxious for us to turn to 
Him. There'. a verse in the 
Bible, in the Old T estarnent, 
that says " ... The Lord longs to ' 
be gracious to you, and ... He 
waits on high to have 

. " compaulon on you .... 
(Isaiah 30: 18). 

Burke's criticism of the 
presentation of the Chriltian 
rneuage ("pious nUM and 
prielta," "evangelical cheat 
thumper." and Dylan's 
"pushinea. '') is a popular 
respOnse to a message that 
challenges people to face their 
own guilt in'order to deal with it 
once and for all. If you can put 
a negative label on the people 
who communicate the 
Christian message, then you 
can comfortably ignore it. I 
urge you to look beyond the 
human fallibility which 
surrounds ~ presentation and 
consider God's offer of l6ve 
and forgivene .. through Jesus 
Chrilt.

Research Pqper Ads 
Worse Than Manual 

Editor: 
Something strange is going 

on with the hassle over the 
Disorientation Manual and 
your crusade against Jon 
Bekken . I see some 
contradictions in your 
righteoulinesll. 

The manual mentioned that 
students have been known to 
forge signatures on petitions 
but warned students doing this 
to send petitions by mail. This 
information reprinted from the· 
1972 DilOrientation Manual, 
was communicated out of a 
conviction, albeit misguided, 
that studenta deserved to know 
about it. 

Coors Abuses 
Workers, Ads 
Shouldn't Run 
Editor: 

Over the last weeki your 
paper has run two full·page 
ads for the Adolph Coors Co. 
They, the makers of Coors 
beer, are notorious for . their 
anti-union, anti-worker 

polic~ and have been the 
subject of a long union 
..,onsored boycott. 

The Coors company 
regularly subjecta it. worker. 
to polygraph test. and waaed 
a vicious anti·union campaign 
against their worken, 
culminating in a decertification 
campaign in which union 
member. - out on a Rveral· 
month long .trike; were not 
pennitted to vote. 

The boycott co~timJeli to 
this day, and has IUCCeeded in 
drastically reducing sales of 
Coors beer. It is indeed sad 
and ironic that The Daily 
Guardian, ~hich has .been 
prote.ting of late about the 
immorality of the ASUCSD 
and the wrongness of deriving 
revenue from the sale of beer, 
should choose to take 
advertising from lIuch· a 
source. 

The Coors company asks, 
in your pages, "What's in a 
Name?" The Adolph Coors 
company hal a name all right. 
Why does your paper choose 
to allociate with it? 

THE PROGRESSIVE 
COALITION 

The Daily Guardian, on the 
other hand, published ads for 
firm semng plagiarized papers. 
It thus puts such people in 
touch with students who can 
then proceed, for a sum, to 
plagiarize, to cheat in classes. 
The Guardian performs thili 
servi<;e not out of a conviction 
that it is right or wrong, but for 
material gain. 

I suggest that the actions of 
both the manual and the 
Guardian are morally 
Qdutidftable . • But it is mora 
odious and hannful to oneself 
and one's fellow students to 
cheat on class work than to 
fake signatures on a petition. It 
is also worse to foster a 
dishonest act for the sake of 
material gain than to do so out 
01 a misguided conviction that 
it is right. 

As for criticisms in your 
pages of the new indicator, at 
least it has observed lOme 
moral .tandarda on adverti· 
sing. Also, it does a pretty 
good job. Ita Oct. 3 iuue, for 
example, is excellent, and 
would compare favorably to 
any college new.paper. '

DC-IO Down in Fog 

MEXICO CITY - US Federal Aviation 
Administra tion officials focused on a severed engine 
yesterday as they investigated the crash of a Western 
Airlines DC·I0 jetliner that slammed onto a closed 
runway at smog·shrouded Mexico City airport, 
killing at least 63 of 88 or 89 persons on board. 

The plane plowed into two buildings as it touched 
down on the runway, shut down for repairs, hit a 
parked truck and killed or injured on the ground. 

One of the DC-lO's thr~ turbines came to rest 
intact near a fence about 900 feet from the res t of the 
wreckage. It was not known whether the engine fell 
from the plane before the crash or was hurled away 
on impact. 

The US Embassy here said the turbine was the tail 
engine of the DC-lO. A sPokesman said it landed on 
the side of the road, across the street from a densely 
populated slum district. 

In Los Angeles, Western Airlines officials said the 
black box flight recorder was retrieved from the 
demolished airliner. The box was turned over to 
Mexican aviation authorities. _ 

Expedition Collides 
COPENHAGEN - A Soviet ship carrying 

scientists and equipment for a polar expedition was 
lost in flames yesterday after it collided w;th another 
Soviet vessel whae sailing in the wrong sea lane of a 
busy Danish strait, officials said. One man was killed, 
three were missing and 95 were saved. by a swarm of 
rescue craft. .... . 

Two Soviet crewmen suffered critical burns and 
four others less serious burns, officials said. All seven 
women aboard were saved. There was no indication 
if the missing persons were crewmen or part of the 
41 -member polar expedition and hone was 
immediately identified. 

Nuke Halt Favored 
NEW YORK - Americans disagree with a 

major finding of the president's commission on Three 
Mile Island , saying that no more nuclear power 
plants sh~uld be built until safety issues a re resolved , 
an ASSOCIated Press NBC News poll shows. 

Majority sentiment for a moratorium on nuclear 
power plant construction is not a result of the accident 
at the Three Mile Island plant earlier this year. At 
most, the a cident appears to have intensified the 
existing support found lor such a moratorium in an 
AP·NBC News poll late last year. 

In interviews this month, 57 percent agreed with 
such a moratorium and 36 percent disagreed. Seven 
percent were not sure. 

This is up only slightly from the finding of the 
APNBC News poll taken in September 1978, when 
52 percent of those questioned were in favor of a 
moratorium on nuclear power plant construction. 
Thirty-nine percent were opposed and 9 percent were 
not sure. 

-Laser Ban Sought 
WASHINGTON - The Air Force 

chief said yesterday the United States probably could 
develop a workable laser beam weapon against some 
Soviet satellites within about four years. 

But Lt. Gen. Thomas P. Stafford said, "We 
decided not to push it." Instead, he said, "We would 
hope to negotiate a treaty" with the Soviet Union that 
would ban such weapons. 

A high.intensity laser generates a concentrated 
beam of light that scientists say could burn out a 
satellite's electronic circuits and key equipment, thus 
disabling it. The United States also has explored the 
possibility of using lasers against hostile miuiles and 
planes. . 

No Pay for Justices? 
SACRAMENTO - State Controller Ken Cory 

asked an appeals court yesterday to let him pay state 
Supreme Court justices while it is determined if they 
violated the constitution by holding cases longer than 
90 days. 

"The potential cost of checking the record. of each 
of these judges each month is staggering," Cory said. 
"Therefore we are asking .. that the injunction be 
stayed until the case is tried on its merits." 

Cory's office petitioned the 3rd District Court of 
Appeal to stay a preliminary injunction cutting off 
pay to the seven justices because they had not ruled 
on some cases 90 days after all arguments were 
submitted. 

The ru~ng was made Sept. 27 by Sacramento 
Superior Court Judge Babich on a suit filed by the 
Law and Order Campaign Committee, which 
unsuccessfully tried to unseat Chief Justice Rose Bird 
in her confirmation election last year. 

LNG Site Occupied 
SANTA BARBARA - Between 30 and 50 

Native Americans and their supporters matched 
onto the proposed liquefieJ natural gas terminal site 
at Point Conception yesterday, vowing to stay until 
they are arrested or until trenching operations at the 
site are halted. 

"They're ready to stay until they're carted off, or 
until they're pretty sure the trenching will not 
proceed," said Johnny flYM, spokesman for the 
Santa Barbara Indian Cente,. 

Sheriff's deputy Douglas Tiffany confirmed that a 
group of Native Americans had moved on to the lIite 
30 miles west of Santa Barbara around 5 am. 

"They ran four guards olf and look over one of 
their vehicles," Tiffany said. "We haven't sent any 
tropp. in. We're waiting to lee what they're going to . 
do."

UCSD Chemists to 
Probe Halley's Comet 

Continued from page I . 
Earlier work by the research team includes radiation studies of 

lunar samples and the design of a similar spectrometer for use of 
the Apollo miuions. 

The UCSD project is only one of a dozen instruments to be 
included for the T empel-2 rendezvous and an additional seven for 
the Halley "f1y.by" portion of the journey. These will monitor such 
thinaa a. mall, magnetic field, dust and various other spectra 
beside the gamma. 

The p~t is still only tentative, says Arnold, requiring the 
approval of Congre ••. Since this approval depends largely on the 
value and cost of the experiments, the people designing them ha ve 
more variables than just the physical with which to contend. 

Auuming the project receives approval, the probe will be 
launched from Shuttle by a small chemical rocket sometime in 
1985, pals Halley in November of the same year and then arrive 
at Ternpel-2 in July, 1988. It will continue sending data for one 
year.

AS Debates Over Ads 
Continued' (rom ()aRt! I 
"there's been a lot of sour 
grapes. I proposed this to 
make people think, to have 
time to cool down." 

Montalvo says, "I believe 
the proponents of this bill have 
taken the issue to an irrational, 
emotional level. In raising this 
to the emotional level they're 
overlooking the facts, and the 
facts are that we are saving 
$7,000." 

Breslauer, who is chair of 
the Rules Committee, explains 
that by taking the bill to her 
committee, the committee 
could amend the bill to make it 
less of ar all-or-nothing 
proposal. "This is not an 

ultimatum," she said. 
The issue will be put to a 

vote at next week's AS 
meeting. 

While the AS deliberates 
the ad issue no student 
organizations will be receiving 
advertising money. Montalvo 
used his discretionary fund for 
an "emergency" ad announc-
ing a 'lpeaker sponsored by the 
Israeli Action Committee this 
week, but the AS council is still 
deliberating whether to 
reimburse him. 

In other business last night, 
the AS resolved to "actively 
support Lumumba-Zapata 
(Third) College and UCSD as 
a whole to recruit minorities," 

and to investigate a renovation 
of the Coffee Hut as a student-
run food facility, and al>j>roved 
the budget for the Student 
Center Board and student 
organizations. 

The council also voted to: 

-Organize a task force to 
look into the possibility of 
rajsing the activity fee from $6 
to $10; 

-Aid CASINO in 
receiving a $27,000 grant

A Real Choice 

Derivative - Befuddled - Excessive Good 
By William Hamilton

One could argue that there 
is artistic merit to this band 
because they are so bad that 
they are camp. But I will 
instead argue that the Only 
Ones are so bad that they are 
terrible. They cannot sing. 
They cannot play. They 
cannot compose. They cannot 
Iyricize. They are a very 
derivative early-Kinks clone 
band, the difference is that the 
Kinks were similar 

material more competently 
(if teen years ago. 

Listening to the lead 
vocalist creates imagery o( 
Donovan with emphysema, or 
Bob Dylan in labor. Enjoy 
profound lyrics like: 

" Run from the beast 
there's darkness in his mind 
• He's been looking fot 
you for a long time .

Jimmy Messina - Oasis 
(CBS) 

Someone drained Jimmy's 
Oasis, building in its stead a 
nice steakhouse where they 
play this album backwards, 
(orwards, sideways, inside-

out, and there is no intelligible 
dillerence. I have with great 
interest (ollowed Messina's 
career since Buffalo 
Springfield days, through two 
pleasant Poco albums, and 
finally to Loggins and 
Messina, where his musician-
ship reached fruition . He 
would have been better off, I 
think, had he launched his solo 
career immediately after L & 
M's demise as did his former 
cohort, Loggins, since the two-
and·a-half year grace period 
he took off for deep reflection 
seems to have befuddled him. 

This album is difficult to 
appraise. It is not bad. The 
production is as clean and 
crisp as any I have heard, the 
back.up band taste/ul, and the 
background vocals exception· 
al. But there are no 
memorable compositions, 
hummable melodies, catchy 
hooks, interesting lyrics ... no 
nutlin'. Each tune blends into 
the next almost imperceptibly. 
The recorq is very listenable, 
yet I would not particularly 
care to hear it again. 
Purchasers expecting Loggins 
and Messina-caliber music will 
be disappointed to hear a 
cocktail lounge band with a 
poor vocalist playing anemic 
Pablo Cruise tunes sporting a 
Jamaican flair. C 
Rick Derringer - Guitars and 
Women (CBS) 

Hard rock musicians should 
not play . pop music. 
Additionally, they should 
avoid Todd Rundgren, the 
mosroverrated producer in the 

business . Derringer has 
committed both errou, 
allowing this album to be 
molded into a Rundgrenesque 
menagerie of sickeningly cute 
pop ditties, interspersed with ' 
an occasional decent rocker. 
All tracks feature Todd and 
members of his band Utopia 
singing backups to Derringer's 
horrible lead vocals . 

Derringer was once highly 
touted as the rock guitarist to 
watch (or in the '70s. If hi. 
playing on this album is any 
indication, we will be waiting 
until the 25th century. A poor 
imitation of Edward Van 
Halen's "Spanish Fly" graces 
side 1. A three·second 
Hendrix guitar-jack·of! 
embellishes another cut, 
totally incongruous within the 
context of - the liong. 
Derringer's guitar playing i. 
plagued by the same excessive 
utilization of special effect. 
(e.g . . f1angers, echo units) 
which is, not coincidentlllly, 
Rundgren's trademark. 
Derringer should either join a 
band with a co·composer and 
a good lead vocalist, and 
practice like a maniac for the 
next year, or plan on selling Sc 
pencil, on streetcorners over 
the duration of his hopefully 
brief career. C minlU
