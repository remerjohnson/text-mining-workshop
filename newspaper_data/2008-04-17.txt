Yesterday afternoon, the town hall 
meeting held to discuss the findings of 
two curricular reports on Thurgood 
Marshall College’s Dimensions of 
Culture writing program erupted in 
a string of public accusations that 
TMC Provost Alan Havis and D.O.C. 
Director Abraham Shragge were fail-
ing to commit to the reports’ recom-
mendations and quality undergradu-
ate education. 

At the meeting, UCSD students 
and faculty members posed ques-

Five UCSD professors partici-
pated in a campaign for cheaper and 
more affordable textbooks Tuesday, 
signing statements acknowledging 
that they will implement cheaper 
online textbooks into their courses 
whenever possible and appropriate. 
They join more than 1,000 professors 
from 300 colleges across the country 
demanding “open textbooks,” a more 
affordable option to those currently 
made available by publishers. 

Open textbooks are complete 
textbooks that are accessible online 
and are reviewed by qualified aca-
demics. As opposed to conventional 
textbooks, open textbooks are under 
open license, allowing users to cus-
tomize and print the textbooks as they 
see fit for a small fee. 

The Affordable Textbooks 
Campaign is a coalition of student 
private interest and research groups 
(PIRGS) and student government 
associations across the country 
attempting to make higher educa-

tion more accessible and financially 
feasible. Originating at UC Irvine, 
the campaign has partnered with the 
California Student Public Interest 
Research Group in an attempt to 
implement open textbook programs 
nationwide. 

So far, open textbooks have been 
implemented at some of the nation’s 
most prestigious universities, includ-

The number of in-state students 
admitted to the Fall 2008 class of the 
UC system increased for the fourth 
straight year to 60,008, representing 
a 4.7-percent hike over last year’s 
admissions and the largest class to 
date, according to a report released 
this week by the UC Office of the 
President. At UCSD, Fall Quarter 
freshmen admissions among in-state 
applicants rose by 1.5 percent to 
16,992 students.

Additionally, the number of black 
and Chicano/Latino resident stu-
dents admitted systemwide for the 
fall increased by 11.3 percent and 16 
percent, leading to 2,305 and 12,432 
admitted students from each under-
represented group, respectively.

Ricardo Vázquez. “That said, [those] 
students continue to be underrepre-
sented at the university. It’s still not 
reflective of the state itself.”

UCSD posted gains similar to 
the systemwide statistics in Chicano 
and Latino admissions with an 11.5-
percent increase to 2,525 students. 
However, campus admissions saw a 
dip in black admits for the first time

D.O.C. program. Some of the struc-
tural concerns raised included the 
absence of ladder-rank faculty, short-
age of educational resources, contro-
versial content material and the lack 
of collaboration among faculty and 
teaching assistants. 

A.C.E. and FCC — curricular 
committees charged with evaluat-
ing the writing program — recently 
released two comprehensive reports 
suggesting a mass overhaul of the 
program. 

The release of the reports has 
fueled further criticism and protest 
against Shragge, who in a controver-
sial move to not rehire two D.O.C. 
teaching assistants last spring quar-
ter.

At a climactic point during the 
forum, UCSD literature profesor Luis 
Cabrera called to have Shragge oust-

ed from his administrative position, 
claiming that Shragge’s dismissal was 
needed in order to successfully enact 
the recommendations outlined by the  
reports. 

Scott Boehm, one of the two 
D.O.C. teaching assistants dismissed 
last year, said that Shragge has wors-
ened many of the weaknesses associ-
ated with the writing program.  

“Shragge’s silence on the curricu-
lum committee report, just like his 
obstinacy during the D.O.C. con-
flict last spring, further demonstrates 
how out of touch he is with campus 
consensus that D.O.C must change,” 
Boehm said.

Other audience members voiced 
concerns that the TMC and D.O.C. 
administrations would fail to imple-

A state bill designed to protect researchers who 
conduct animal testing from harassment by animal-
rights activists will be reviewed by the California State 
Assembly Judiciary committee today.

Assembly Bill 2296 proposes to prohibit the per-
sonal information of University of California animal 
researchers from being displayed on the Internet and 
would allow UC officials to withhold such information 
from public records. The legislation would also man-
date harsher punishments for those who commit acts 
of violence or harassment against researchers, making 
such acts a finable misdemeanor.

Authored by Assemblyman Gene Mullin (D-South 
San Francisco), the proposed legislation is a reaction 
to increased violence against UC researchers over the 
past year. 

Specific acts cited as reason for the bill include a 
February incident during which six masked men dis-
rupted the home of a UC Santa Cruz biology professor 
and breast cancer researcher. The protestors attempted 
to enter her home during a child’s birthday party and

Digital Smoke Machine Cuts 
Computer Graphics Costs
UCSD computer scientists have 

developed a fog and smoke machine 
for highly realistic computer graphics 
that cuts the computing cost of cre-
ating 3-D images from scratch. Their 
findings will be showcased today at 
Europe’s premier computer graphics 
conference, Eurographics 2008, in 
Crete, Greece.

This new advancement achieves 
greater realism through the use of 
“ray-tracing algorithms,” which have 
recently become the basis of a major 
shift in the computer graphics, film, 
animation and video-game indus-
tries. These algorithms calculate how 
light in computer-generated imag-
es would behave in the real world, 
based on the laws of nature.

Specifically, UCSD’s recent work 
uses “photon mapping,” a subset of 
the ray-tracing algorithms that col-
lects all lighting information in com-
puter-generated scenes at once and 
minimizes the amount of unwanted 
visual noise that previously obscured 
images.

“We took an algorithm that is 
already great and made it more effi-
cient,” said Wojciech Jarosz, the 
first author on the new Eurographics 
paper and a doctoral candidate from 
the department of computer science 
and engineering at UCSD’s Jacobs 
School of Engineering.

The new method is an improve-
ment upon the Academy Award-win-
ning photon-mapping technique that 
UCSD computer science professor 
Henrik Wann Jensen developed dur-
ing his doctoral studies. Jensen and 
fellow UCSD computer science pro-
fessor Matthias Zwicker coauthored 
the paper that will be showcased at 

the Eurographics conference.

Scientists Predicts Major 
Earthquake for SoCal
California has an almost 

guaranteed chance of being 
struck by a major earthquake 
in the next 30 years, Southern 
California scientists said this week 
in the state’s most comprehensive 
geologic forecast.

The state faces a more than 99-
percent chance of being hit by a 
magnitude 6.7 temblor — the size 
of the 1994 Northridge quake — 
the report stated. According to the 
report, there is also a nearly 50-
percent chance that California will 
experience a magnitude 7.5 quake, 
which could inflict catastrophic 
damage if it is centered in a large 
city such as San Diego, Los Angeles 
or San Francisco.

“We can expect that we’re going 
to get hammered by a big earthquake 
and we’d better be prepared,” 
Southern California Earthquake 
Center Director Tom Jordan said. 
“Magnitude 7.5, that’s a really big 
earthquake. You’re talking about an 
earthquake that might span 200 miles 
of fault length and a displacement of 
12 feet or more.”

Jordan said there is a 37-percent 
chance that a 7.5 magnitude quake 
will hit Southern California, compared 
to a 15-percent chance in Northern 
California, largely due to the 1906 
San Francisco earthquake, which 
relieved stress from the San Andreas 
Fault in that region.

The 1906 San Francisco quake 
was estimated to have a magnitude 
of around 7.8. The last quake of this 
size in Southern California occurred 
in 1857.

Council Could Move Voter Drives into 
Dorms for ’08 Presidential Elections

Last night’s A.S. Council meeting was built on a theme of social awareness as councilmembers 
entertained discussions about activism, 
philanthropy and civic engagement.

Alma Natalia De Castro of 
the Student Senate for California 
Community Colleges spoke during 
public input about a protest April 21 to 
oppose Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
proposed budget cuts to public educa-
tion. She said the San Diego rally will 
coincide with similar events elsewhere 
in the state. She asked the A.S. Council 
to send a representative to speak at the 
event; the invitation  didn’t garner a 
response.

Eleanor Roosevelt College Senator 
Stephanie Usry 
asked the coun-
cil to participate 
in UCSD Cares 
Week, which is 
scheduled to take 
place during week 
five. Usry said the 
event could pro-
vide a “last hurrah to give back to 
the community” as this year’s council 
enters its final weeks.

Sixth College Senator John Cressey 
took up Usry’s call later in the meeting, 
asking for philanthropic brainstorming 
from his colleagues. Facing a dearth 
of responses, Cressey let the lack of an 
idea slide but still committed to signing 
up the council for UCSD Cares Week 
anyway, presumably with the hopes of 
identifying a more specific plan soon.

The council also debated the issue of 
“dorm storming,” which refers to non-
partisan voter registration drives enter-
ing the domain of student dormitories.

At issue was a resolution that favored 
the implementation of dorm storming 
with the permission a college’s resident 
dean in pursuit of greater civic engage-
ment. The practice seemingly brought 
two favorite causes of student leaders 

into conflict — privacy and voting.
Thurgood Marshall College Chair 

Lana Blank was first to express skepti-
cism over the proposed resolution.

“I feel like we should have a certain 
respect for the residence,” she said of 
voter-registering dorm stormers. “It’s 
one thing if you can go into OVT, [but] 
it’s another thing if you can come into 
my suite.”

Blank also related the prospect of 
dorm storming to student complaints 
about overly nosy residential security 
officers not being respectful of stu-
dents’ privacy. 

“Why are we making ourselves just 
like things we’re fighting against?” she 
asked. “We don’t like RSOs going into 

private spaces.”
CalPIRG rep-

resentative Daniel 
Teplitz attended 
the meeting to 
speak on the mat-
ter and encouraged 
the council the pass 
the resolution in 

light of the upcoming presidential elec-
tion. When UCSD begins Fall Quarter, 
student organizers will have less than 
a month to register voters before the 
deadline, an opening that Teplitz said 
could be used effectively with the help 
of dorm storming.

“[With] access to the dormitories 
… we could register so many more 
students on campus than we have 
[before],” he said. “It’s one of the best 
ways to talk to students because they 
have time when they’re at home.”

President Marco Murillo said 
that he was worried that the resolu-
tion lacked the strategic wording and 
concrete details necessary for admin-
istrators to take it seriously and rec-
ommended the council postpone the 
resolution for two weeks. The council 
agreed with his suggestion and will 
revisit civics later this month.

reportedly assaulted her husband.

UCLA researchers and graduate 
students have also reported person-
al threats, violence and harassing 
phone calls and e-mails. The wife 
of one researcher received a box 
of razor blades and fur in the mail. 
Additionally, several Molotov cock-
tails have been left near the homes 
of faculty members, prompting the 
resignation of one professor and  
UCLA administrators to pursue 
restraining orders against several 
animal-rights groups.

UC Santa Cruz Chancellor 
George Blumenthal said at a press 
conference that research conducted 
using animals is highly regulated 
and subject to strict standards. 

“People get nervous with living 
specimens but this research is very 
important for the future of health 
care,” Blumenthal said. “Addressing 
the discomfort of that research with 
terror is unacceptable.”

UCLA Chancellor Gene Block 
said that the harassment of UC 
researchers disrupts important sci-
entific progress. 

“These scientists are doing very 
important medical research and 
they should be free to pursue that 
research without the harassment of 
themselves or their families,” he 
said. “The behavior we’re seeing is 
really outrageous and we need to 
put an end to an intolerable situ-
ation.”

Steven Beckwith, UC system-
wide vice president for research and 
graduate studies, said in a telecon-
ference this week that these activi-
ties are comparable to terrorism.

Zipcar Merges into UCSD Fast Lane

By Larisa Casillas
Contributing Writer

Zipcar, the world’s largest car-
sharing service company, announced 
last week that it has partnered with 
UCSD to provide new transporta-
tion options for the university. The 
partnership, which began last year, 
comes as part of Zipcar’s national 
integration with Flexcar, UCSD’s 
previous communal car service com-
pany.

There are now 14 Zipcars, for-
mer Flexcars, strategically placed 
around campus for students, faculty 
and staff who are over the age of 18 
to access 24 hours a day. Riders 21 
and older can also access Zipcar’s 
extended car network throughout 
the United Sates and in the United 
Kingdom. For an hourly or daily 
rate, the self-service cars — with 
gas, insurance, maintenance and 
parking provided — can be reserved 
via phone or online.

UCSD Rideshare and Marketing 
Manager Curt Lutz said the cars are 
useful for anything from running 
quick errands to weekend trips. 

“Car sharing can be a convenient 
and cost-effective solution to driv-
ing your own car to campus,” Lutz 
said. “Students who live on campus 

and only need a vehicle occasionally 
could save quite a bit on parking fees, 
insurance and other vehicle costs for 
a vehicle they may rarely use.”

Zipcar has worked with UCSD’s 
rideshare program to fulfill a con-
tract agreement with Transportation 
and Parking Services, and is offer-
ing subsidized Zipcar membership 
and rates for all UCSD students, 
staff and faculty.

Zipcar General Manager of 

Universities Jenny Larios said in a 
statement that there are benefits to 
alternative transportation options. 

“Zipcar helps alleviate the stress 
that individually owned vehicles 
bring to the students, the university, 
and most importantly, the environ-
ment,” she said.

UCSD is now one of the many 
colleges to employ Zipcar as an 
alternative means of transporta-
tion. Other colleges include MIT, 

Columbia, Georgetown, University 
of Michigan, University of 
Minnesota, University of Toronto, 
University of North Carolina and 
University of Chicago.

The founders of Zipcar said they 
were inspired to create a commu-
nal method of transportation in the 
United Sates after observing a simi-
lar method in Berlin. Since then, 
they have strived to decrease car 
usage, and promoted other trans-
portation methods, such as biking, 
walking and public transportation.

“Car-sharing programs like 
Zipcar are part of the broader spec-
trum of programs offered through 
the university’s rideshare programs,” 
Lutz said. It is meant to give access 
to personalized cars when needed 
for those who participate in ride-
share programs such as ride-match-
ing, carpooling, vanpooling, public 
transit and bicycling.

At the end of March, the 
Rideshare Operations program 
of T&PS received the San Diego 
Association of Governments’ 2008 
Diamond Award for “Ongoing 
Commitment” to improving region-
al commute.

“The university is working as 
part of the greater community to 
reduce our share of traffic and park-
ing impacts, to reduce pollution 
and to better use resources and 
work toward greater sustainability,” 
Lutz said. “Together, we are moving 
in the right direction.”

“We are very disappoint-
ed,” Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Admissions and Enrollment Services 
Mae Brown said of the decrease in 
black admitted students. “Our pri-
mary goal at this point is to continue 
to work hard to encourage students to 
accept our offers of admission.”

Brown said that the “slight decline” 
in the number of black students admit-
ted to UCSD could be caused in part 
by the higher level of selectiveness 
exercised by the campus in the face of 
an increasingly large applicant pool.

“We certainly will do a lot of analy-
sis to see where we saw decreases in 
the admission of African-American 
students,” she said.

UCSD’s acceptance rate among in-
state freshmen applicants fell from 
41.1 percent to 40.2 percent this year, a 
trend that Brown said she expects will 
continue as strong academic programs 
and faculty bolster UCSD’s reputa-
tion.

Budget Cuts May Affect Future Applicants
▶ ADMISSIONS, from page 1 The increase in admissions to the 

UC system comes at a time when its 
funding outlook is uncertain. Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 2008-09 
budget proposal fell $417 million 
short of what the UC Board of Regents 
requested to support the 10-campus 
system for the next fiscal year, but the 
system has continued “to offer a space 
to every California resident applicant 
who is UC-eligible,” according to the 
report.

“The cuts proposed by the gover-
nor are potentially devastating,” said 
Vázquez, adding that students would 
encounter reduced services and larger 
class sizes as a result. The proposed 
cuts would also impact the univer-
sity’s ability to live up to its “histori-
cal promise” of offering admission to 
every qualified California resident.

“Enrolling additional students 
without additional funding is not sus-
tainable in the long run, so it clearly 
will … bring pressure on next year’s 
admissions,” he said.

“When someone comes into your 
house and threatens your family or 
floods your home and threatens to 
set it on fire or kill you, we refer to 
that as terrorism,” Beckwith said. 
“This is criminal behavior which 
is intended to terrorize ordinary 
citizens, not free speech.”

Although federal legislation 
designed to protect researchers cur-
rently exists, Block said that the pro-
posed bill would protect researchers 
more effectively and close a num-
ber of loopholes that activists have 

taken advantage of in the past. 
Concerns have been raised, 

however, over the degree to which 
the bill would limit information 
accessible to the public. 

Although the personal informa-
tion of UC researchers can current-
ly be accessed through the National 
Institutes of Health — a federal 
database — the text of the bill states, 
“No person, business or association 
shall knowingly publicly post or 
publicly display on the Internet 
the home address, home telephone 
number or image of any employee 

of an animal enterprise.”
Mullin, however, said that cer-

tain limitations to the release of 
public information are necessary to 
ensure the safety of UC research-
ers. 

“We are not in the business of 
narrowing constitutional provi-
sions,” Mullin said. “We’re trying 
to balance those protections along 
with making sure researchers aren’t 
subject to dire consequences.”

Bill Would Seal Loopholes in Federal Law

Confronted with both increasing 
enrollment and potentially decreasing 
state funds, Vázquez said that “one 
thing the university will not do is 
lower our standards.”

Brown echoed Vázquez’s concern. 
“If there’s not a change [in the pro-
posed budget] then the campuses 
and the system will have to look very 
carefully at enrollment planning,” she 
said. 

Brown also speculated that this 
year’s economic downturn could 
persuade more admitted students to 
enroll at selective public institutions 
like UCSD instead of more expensive 
private universities.

A larger-than-expected level of 
new student enrollment through-
out the UC system could add to the 
system’s financial difficulties of the 
system, which experienced overenroll-
ment at some campuses last fall.

Havis: D.O.C. Changes Being Considered
▶ D.O.C., from page 1
ment the changes in the report, espe-
cially because executive decisions 
regarding changes to the structure 
of an undergraduate writing course 
require the creation of an implemen-
tation committee.

Literature professor Jorge Mariscal 
said that the TMC administration 
should act now rather than continue 
to debate changes to the program. 

“Pre-emptive action, not more 
committees, will go a long way to 
creating the space that you men-
tioned in your commitment to 
implement the changes made by the 
faculty committee,” Mariscal said. 

Havis, however, reassured con-
cerned audience members that  
TMC administrators were taking 

the necessary measures in following 
implementation procedures.  

“Doing a meeting like today is 
good faith that we are in change,” 
he said. “Doing a meeting like today 
[means] that we are thinking of the 
implementation of the report. We 
project perhaps too much pessimism 
about next year or in next two months. 
This is really bad thinking in my idea 
because we are going forward. We 
have to have the willingness to believe 
that the process is unfolding.”

Despite these reassurances, many 
TMC faculty members continued to 
voice their doubts over the effective 
implementation of the two curricu-
lar reports’ findings.

History professor David 
Gutierrez, chair of FCC, said that the 

current D.O.C. faculty would have to 
be cleaned out in order to facilitate 
the future realization of the curricu-
lum reports’ recommendations. 

A number of D.O.C. TAs have 
expressed that under the current 
administration they feel unwelcome 
and discouraged from expressing 
curricular suggestions to faculty 
members for fear of hostile reaction 
to their ideas. 

“I feel that there has been an 
atmosphere of hostility,” D.O.C. lec-
turer Lynn Ta said. “In fact, I was 
told that my suggestions were quote 
‘horseshit.’ This is extremely unpro-
fessional to me.”

as some of the nation’s largest educa-
tion systems, including the California 
Community College system, the 
California State University system 
and the Arizona State University sys-
tem. 

Erin Steva, the UCSD campus 
organizer for CalPIRG, said that 
both students and professors are 
frustrated with publisher tactics that 
drive up prices for quality textbooks. 

“Oftentimes, when choosing text-
book materials for their classes, fac-
ulty members find that publishing 
industry prices are not readily avail-
able,” Steva said. “In fact, a recent 
survey titled “Exposing the Textbook 
Industry” reported that 77 percent 
of the faculty surveyed felt that text-
book marketing representatives rare-
ly volunteered textbook pricing, and 
of the faculty who asked for prices, 
only 38 percent got an answer.”

Steva added that university faculty 
members play a crucial role in creat-
ing optimal and sustainable solutions 
to high textbook prices. 

“The statements of intent signed 
by faculty members create support 
and awareness about open textbooks 
and emphasize that both high qual-
ity education and affordability are 
important criteria’s in choosing text-
books,” Steva said. “Professors and 
faculty are part of the solution and 
are our closet allies in the struggle for 
affordable textbooks.”

Steva said that transitioning to 
open textbooks would also create 
sustainability and a greener cam-
pus because of a lesser reliance on 
printed material. 

“Oftentimes, publishers will 
release new editions of a textbook 
with only a few changes as a tactic to 
drive up textbook fees and sell more 
books,” Steva said. “Bookstores can 
no longer sell the older version of 
the textbook and oftentimes students

cannot resell their older version as 
well. This often results in tons of 
wasted books and paper. With open 
textbooks, professors and students 
can choose to print only specific 
sections of textbooks, which is both 
cheaper and environmentally friend-
lier.” 

Nicole Allen, the national advo-
cate for Open Textbooks at CalPIRG, 
said that the rising costs of textbooks 
are becoming a substantial part of 
total student fees. 

According to a study conducted 
by the Government Accountability 

Office, textbooks cost students an 
average of $900 a year, roughly equat-
ing to a quarter of annual tuition 
at four-year public universities and 
nearly three-quarters of annual 
tuition at community colleges across 
the country. 

“At community colleges tuition 
amounts to about $20 a unit,” Allen 
said.  “With students spending an 
additional $900 a year because of high 
textbook prices, textbooks can price 
students out of higher education.”  

Earl Warren College  Senator 
Peter Benesch was present at this 
week’s press conference, where 
UCSD faculty members announced 
their support for open textbooks.  

“Open textbooks directly address 

issues regarding access to and afford-
ability of a public university and 
higher education in general,” Benesch 
said. “Oftentimes, affordability and 
accessibility towards higher educa-
tion is not given enough attention 
and a lot of people skirt the issue, but 
in the end, a lot of people, especially 
students who don’t receive any type 
of financial aid, end up paying the 
price.”

Benesch said that textbook fees 
can oftentimes exceed the estimated 
yearly average of $900.

“As a political science major, I 
pay relatively less compared to a lot 
of my friends in the hard sciences,”  
Benesch said. “A lot of my friends 
who are in science majors like biol-
ogy or chemistry can pay up to $500 
a quarter for textbooks, and that 
equates to $1,500 a year, much more 
than the national average.”

Benesch added that students often 
get stuck with textbooks they cannot 
sell back to bookstores because of 
changes in versions. 

“From what I gather, approxi-
mately 20 percent of students get 
stuck with old textbooks that they 
cannot sell back to vendors,” Benesch 
said. 

Benesch added that UCSD pro-
fessors who are participating in the 
campaign can select textbooks that 
are available online, and students can 
then have copies of the text printed 
for about $10.

“Hopefully, if the program goes 
over well with the initial faculty that 
is participating in it, we can see an 
more professors utilize open text-
books over the coming quarters,” 
Besesch said. “When it comes to 
affordable, accessible, and qual-
ity education, open textbooks are a 
win-win situation for professors and 
students.”

EDITORIALS

The loud trumpet call across the University of California feting large gains of minor-
ity admissions is conspicuously 
quiet at UCSD. This university’s 
newest admissions data shows 
that the most underrepresented 
students at this campus — blacks 
and American Indians — are slip-
ping in numbers. It marks a grim 
indication of the long, steep climb 
in store for campus leaders.

At UCSD, admissions of 
underrepresented students 
showed a 6.9-percent increase 
overall, buoyed by a jump in the 
number of Latino admits. But 
the admission of blacks and 
American Indians dropped 10.2 
percent and 21.8 percent, respec-
tively. The number of those stu-
dents who enroll at UCSD could 
be even smaller, considering its 
relatively undeveloped outreach 
and diversity-related offices. And 
only 8.4 percent of admits were 
from local areas, which could be 
mined for even larger gains in 
Latino admissions. 

Sandra Daley, named the cam-
pus’ chief diversity officer in 
January, is UCSD’s most apparent 
instrument in the fight to widen 

the admissions pool. 
The relatively new diversi-

ty office holds potential, with 
administrators  emphasizing 
Daley’s firsthand experience with 
local outreach and her ability to 
forge collaborative and vital part-
nerships. 

A meeting with the Guardian’s 
Editorial Board showed much 
of that shine; Daley’s impres-
sive resume with diversity issues 
in health care was still dwarfed 
by her uncurbed enthusiasm to 
pick at the mountainous issue. 
Her local hands-on work with the 
underrepresented better positions 
her to address this campus’ needs, 
and sweetens the prospect of local 
diversity-related partnerships and 
initiatives. Daley has a knack in 
that exact area, as she oversaw 
the creation of programs like the 
Community Outreach Partnership 
Center at the UCSD School of 
Medicine. Daley herself speaks of 
UCSD’s diversity problems like 
a sociologist, hoping to critical-
ly examine trends and prod the 
world of academia for solutions.

Daley’s office will hopefully be 
the machine that generates more 
than just diversity-related grants, 

scholarships and programs, but 
a tangible, vibrantly progressive 
social consciousness at UCSD.

Daley’s best-suited partner 
could be right across campus. 
Lisa Chen, the newly elected A.S. 
vice president of external affairs, 
has also expressed a flair for col-
laboration, citing partnerships 
between underrepresented work-
ers and students in the common 
cause for standard wages. Daley’s 
academic take on the diversity 
problem makes a unique mesh 

with Chen’s student-worker col-
lective; together, the two cover 
widely separated, but equally 
important, solutions. 

And both will be blessed with 
S.P.A.C.E.S., an outreach center 
in Price Center which should be 
the site of any campus-related 
outreach work in local areas. It 
will offer a much-needed physi-
cal space dedicated to diversity-
related work. Its effectiveness 
will be needed to address UCSD’s 
now-glaring problem.

At different universities, cer-tain traits come to mind that separate one area of higher 
learning from another. 

At Loyola Marymount University 
in Los Angeles, for example, a com-
bination of well-manicured lawns 
and ripe palm trees dot the campus 
landscape. At Pepperdine University, 
arguably one of the nation’s most 
beautiful campuses, ocean breezes 
sweep in from the beaches and into 
the university’s park-like ambiance.

Of course, wickedly coarse uni-
versities exist, and must somehow 
contribute to feelings of learning 
in wantonly aggregated pestilence. 
Chief among these laggards are 
(in no particular order): Cal State 
Monterey Bay, Harvey Mudd College 
and UC Berkeley. And somewhere 
in the middle of these extremes 
resides our own campus.   

Two weeks ago, I met one of 
my close friends at Harry’s Coffee 
Shop on La Jolla’s Girard Avenue 
where, dining on bacon and eggs, 
we spoke on topics ranging from the 
rate of iceberg depletion in Alert, 
Nunavut to how best to navigate 
incoming calls while in class. As a 
San Diego State University student, 
she had never been to UCSD. And 
as she was celebrating her spring 
break that week, I thought it well to 
invite the Aztec over to my haunts 
to check out where “the smart ones” 
intermingle. 

We spent some time around for-
est-y Muir College first, where I 
estimated that a good conversation 
could develop around the serene, 
old, curiously droopy eucalyptus 
trees. Yet after this initial venture, I 
was at a loss. Should we head south 
to historic Revelle College, where a 
student burnt himself in the name of 
peace, or might we instead traverse 
the newer portions that constitute 
Eleanor Roosevelt College? 

I was at an impasse at that 
moment, but I mustered enough 
foresight to consider that perhaps 
my guest would like an authentic 
UCSD beverage. And so, we headed

The base mission of Thurgood 
Marshall College’s Dimensions of 
Culture writing program is steeped 
in ideals of social justice and bet-
terment. It’s a touchy subject that 
brings fever to those who believe 
those principles have been tar-
nished. Throw in allusions to rev-
olutionaries and TMC’s founding, 
and the controversy surrounding 
D.O.C. becomes something wider 
in scope and importance. In fact, 
how UCSD treats D.O.C. in the near 

future will shape its approach to the 
entire six-college system.

This realization comes easy 
because there is no simple solu-
tion. The core cirriculum of D.O.C. 
cannot be improved without deeply 
rooted surgery of university infra-
structure. The newest report from 
D.O.C. overseers calls for a cage-
shaking that includes overhauling 
recruitment methods and establish-
ing faculty leadership.

Essentially, the social health of 
D.O.C. curriculum is married to 
the teaching quality; will classroom 
teachers be committed to the pro-

gram’s purpose as an social enlight-
ener? Will they have the verve to dig 
deep into the prickly spheres of race 
and culture?

As it stands, such moxie is rare to 
find in ladder-rank faculty. D.O.C. 
even banks on teaching assistants 
to lead some classes. The loudest 
voices in the D.O.C. debate, from 
professors like David Gutierrez, are 
exactly the type that need to have 
charge of classes if the program’s 
original principles are to be pre-
served.

The report points to systematic 
weaknesses as the deterrent for pre-

mier faculty from teaching D.O.C. 
Simply put, there is no incentive. 
Faculty equipped to handle the 
expansive, perpetually complicated 
realms of diversity, race and social 
improvement won’t bite on the unsa-
vory bait of the D.O.C. program. 

There is no bonus given, no 
rank bestowed for teaching D.O.C. 
classes, aside from the privilege of 
furthering the program’s mission. 
But even worse, the best faculty 
are not being lured from D.O.C. — 
they’re being forced from it. After 
all, why would a professor steer 
from department-demanded grants 

and projects to handle an under-
graduate class without some meaty 
incentive? The system is naturally 
set up to funnel the highest-quality 
faculty away from D.O.C., yet the 
core mission suggests that it needs 
the best faculty.

In a sit-down interview with the 
Guardian, TMC Provost Allan Havis 
strung the problem across all of the 
colleges’ writing programs. While 
each of the colleges’ writing pro-
grams wield their own themes and 
mission statements, they all clumsily

Almost nothing can spoil sweet victory, unless it’s the surprise that’s ruined. 
Newly crowned A.S. President 
Donna Bean had her surprise 
ruined months ago when she 
entered the race as the lone can-
didate, having enjoyed her vic-
tory last week almost mocking-
ly. As a whole, Student Voice! 
won unsurprising victories in a 
sweep that brings the slate to the 
forefront of student politics. The 
most promising sign shows the 
council’s most senior positions 
— the president and its three vice 
presidents — flying a singular 
flag mission statement and set of 
principles.

The flaccid attitude of the 
elections may not last long, as 
Bean will push budget discus-
sions up a week to accommodate 
an early absence at the quarter’s 
end. Debates over the budget will 
provide the first signs of trouble, 
as councilmembers tackle hulk-
ing financial questions. The larg-
est question hovers over the Sun 
God Festival’s ballooning costs, 
in which students may be forced 
to shoulder via a wildly unpopu-
lar activity fee hike. Budget dis-
cussions will also undoubtedly 
touch on hot topics such as the 

increasingly questionable vitality 
of the Grove Caffe and expendi-
tures of athletics-related entities 
like Triton Tide.

SV! candidates say that they 
substituted the time and effort 
usually reserved for competitive 
campaigning for bonding over 
and discussing pressing campus 
issues. It is intangible, emotive 
work that should help to unify 
the council; it is the kind of work 
better done earlier than later.
Considering the quick turnover 
of student leaders, stability in 
slate agendas and concentrated 
effort on singular aims are the 
best chance at securing UCSD 
student empowerment.

The health of student empow-
erment, SV!’s platform, will make 
or break Bean’s legacy, and even-
tually that of the slate. Her hope 
toward institutionally strength-
ening the student hinges on her 
senatorial transition program, 
which will help ease new students 
into the campus’ political process 
and hopefully equip them with 
the basic understanding of their 
areas. 

The council is currently 
languishing without any pro-
cess through which to train or 
familiarize new politicians with 

their duties and responsibilities. 
Freshmen are eager to learn but 
are naive and unknowledgeable, 
while upperclassmen are often-
times content to serve only a nar-
row sect of constituents.

But now, we are told that the 
picture will be different. With the 
SV!-led council, near-finalized 
constitution, early start on politi-
cal work, and blinders-on inten-
tion of increasing student power 
on campus, Bean promises stu-
dent politicians that will be more 
active, well-informed and single-
minded on students’ needs.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lazaro
Springtime Light Rail Trip 
Highlights Green Agenda

Dear Editor,
As a UCSD student, I know our 

generation, and the generations after 
us, will suffer the most from global 
warming, traffic, peak oil and growing 
transportation problems. That’s why, 
with nearly 50 other college students 
from all over California, I decided to 
do something a little different for my 
spring break.

We went on a road trip, but not 
to Mexico. Instead, we traveled the 
route of the proposed high-speed rail 
line from San Francisco down to San 
Diego, and met with local leaders and 
reporters along the way to share why 
we students believe high-speed rail is 
essential to the future of California. At 
our San Diego stop, Escondido Mayor 
Lori Holt Pfeiler, National City Mayor 
Ron Morrison, Solana Beach Mayor 
Joe Kellejian and High Speed Rail 
Authority Board Member Lynn Shenk 
joined us in calling for the high-speed 
rail project to be built as quickly as 
possible.

Global warming creates rising sea 
levels, which threaten our coastline 
and decrease snow pack in the Sierra 
Nevada that in turn reduces our water 
supply; the largest source of global 
warming pollution is our use of oil for 
transportation. We need cleaner and 
more efficient cars, but we also need 
to drive less in order to reduce our 
pollution levels by 80 percent by 2050, 
as scientists say we must to avoid the 
worst impacts.

Building a high-speed rail line is 
not just about reducing global warm-
ing pollution. More than 37 million 
people live in California right now, 
and our population is expected to 
grow to 50 million residents by 2030. 
Traffic congestion in our urban areas 
already ranks as some of the worst in 
the country, wasting our time and gas. 

For example, the average commuter 
in San Diego spends 57 hours a year 
stuck in traffic. Skyrocketing oil prices 
serve as a reminder that the era of 
cheap oil is already over.

If we don’t build a high-speed rail 
line, we will default to more roads 
and highways instead, not to mention 
expensive airport expansions. Those 
alternatives don’t just increase our reli-
ance on cars. They are actually more 
expensive than building high-speed 
rail. I know that we need people like 
me speaking out in support of the 
high-speed rail, which for too long has 
been delayed by politicians who want 
to spend money on roads instead.

So that’s why I decided to do some-
thing a little different for my spring 
break. I want to be able to get from the 
Bay Area to Los Angeles in less than 
three hours by train. Because we need 
to reduce our pollution. Because traf-
fic will only get worse without alter-
natives like high-speed rail. Because 
California has a choice to make about 
our transportation future, and high-
speed rail is a much better choice than 
more highways and airport runways.

Full-Blown Recruitment Evaluation Needed
▶ D.O.C., from page 4 battle college writing programs 

for the same pool of professors. 
Oftentimes, departments win out 
because faculty are more attracted to 
grants or published works.

If the campus wants to fulfill the 
original, lofty purposes of D.O.C., 
the program simply needs to install 
the right teachers to run it. But to 
achieve that, rearrangement will 
need to happen within the admin-

istration and operation of TMC to 
make D.O.C. a magnet for faculty of 
that caliber. 

And even beyond that, the same 
technique could be applied to all of 
the colleges’ writing programs. It’s 
a much-needed solution, as all six 
programs suffer from complaints of 
watered-down, shallow curriculum 
tied to a lackluster crew of ladder-
rank, or lower, faculty.

east, passing the singing trees and 
the dirt that surrounded them while 
we followed the concrete path.

Nearing Price Center, I offered 
a sit-down at the Roma Cafe but 
Jamba Juice seemed to be the bet-
ter deal. After all, winding through 
UCSD’s various plateaus could 
exhaust even the fittest guest, and 
my own agreed with my position 
that that a cold drink would prove 
more satisfying.

It was there, at that moment, 
that I realized that all of my tal-
ents could not 
substitute my 
inadequacy as a 
personal campus 
tour guide. After 
some mumbo 
jumbo about

Beachy Decor Could Be Key 
to Livelier Campus Look

▶ PRAGMATIST,PRAGMATIST,PRAGMATIST from page 4 about the scenery in and around my 
fair campus. I managed to reason 
that the prison-like facade of the 
biology department couldn’t attract 
an aesthetic thumbs up. Nor could 
the creaky eucalyptus trees neces-
sarily substitute the lush tropical 
aura of the grand palms over at 
SDSU. 

Then again, coming up with 
overly ambitious words to cover the 
acronym CLICS may also be viewed 
upon as a geeky move to an outsider. 
Yet, I can also see why there is a prob-
lem with naming a college “Sixth,” 

for the poor 
place doesn’t 
appear to belong 
anywhere.

Interestingly, 
it would seem 
like I have gotten 
nowhere with 
this bit of shared 
experience. In 
turn, what I 
have discovered 
is that I am in 
fact at a draw if I 
were to proclaim 
UCSD a genu-
inely beautiful 
area in which to 
pursue a higher 

education. Perhaps stimulating the 
environment by bulldozing a por-
tion of the sad eucalyptus grove and 
inserting bright and cheery palm 
trees may do the trick. 

Or maybe adding an escalator to 
connect Geisel library to the sum-
mit of that bluff where the top half 
of UCSD resides would not dis-
suade otherwise level-ground-lov-
ing individuals. Alas, I am again at 
an impasse.

As best I could decipher, howev-
er, UCSD is not ugly nor particularly 
beautiful. Somehow, it’s neither.

THE BEST SONGS 

IN HIATUS 
THIS WEEK

By Chris Mertan
Associate Hiatus Editor

I t’s official: Judd Apatow doesn’t sleep. Ever. Instead, the current go-to guy for American comedy gets his rest by endlessly green-
lighting films, jumping from project to proj-
ect with the frequency of a cheap ham radio. 
Movie-geek-Bible www.imdb.com currently 
tabs five Apatow films somewhere in the pro-
duction stages among others on deck (really 
looking forward to “Untitled Judd Apatow/
Adam Sandler Project” slated for next year), 
with Apatow filling shoes as writer, director, 
producer or executive producer on any given 
flick. The man’s got his hands so deep in real-
istic sentimentality and dick jokes that you’d 
expect it’d only be a matter of time before he 
nosedives and crashes into the Hollywood 
wasteland inhabited by has-beens like John 
Hughes (who, incidentally, co-wrote Apatow’s 
other recent release, “Drillbit Taylor.” “Walk 
Hard,” that ill attempt at biopic mockery 
from last year, seemed to suggest it, but alas, 
Apatow strikes his mighty paw back with 
“Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” 
a fine comedy which jettisons 
much of the past sweetness of 
“Knocked Up” and “Superbad,” 
ups the male full-frontal and 
spins the year’s funniest film 
thus far.

Apatow regular Jason Segal 
(who penned “Forgetting Sarah 

Marshall”) stars as perennial slacker Peter, a 
composer for a CSI spoof and recent ex-boy-
friend of said show’s lead sex kitten, the titular 
Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell of “Veronica 
Mars”). After an unexpected breakup, he wan-
ders his apartment in wanton abandon, aim-
lessly crying and bedding as many women as 
possible to numb the pain.

Of course, it doesn’t help, and with the 
aid of his stepbrother Brian (Bill Hader), 
Peter jumps the glamorous bowels of Los 
Angeles for a beachfront getaway in Hawaii. 
So does Sarah Marshall, alongside new beau 
Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), a remarkably 
promiscuous British rocker who finds every-
way conceivable to combine his favorite pas-
times of music, sex and humanitarianism. 
Helping Peter cope with the unexpected run-
in is hotel receptionist 
Rachel (Mila Kunis) 
and another parade of 
Apatow’s cavalcade of 
comedy, including per-
petually stoned Paul 
Rudd, Jonah Hill of 

“Superbad” as an employee and Jack McBrayer 
(“30 Rock”) as a religious newlywed aghast 
at discovering what a honeymoon actually 
entails. The series of subplots featuring Peter 
and his gang, not to mention phone confer-
encing with his stepbrother, are some of the 
best laughs.

From there you can almost shout out the 
plot points minutes before they occur, from 
Peter’s breakdowns to the inevitable blossom-
ing of his relationship with feisty firebrand 
Rachel, extroverted enough to break Peter 
out of his emotional shell. They’re paint-by-
numbers, but “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” was 
never meant to be about narrative originality. 
Rather, Segal and director Nicholas Stoller 
prop up each scene with tremendous charac-
ter attention and thousands of zingers.

Take the scene where Rachel and Peter are 
fatefully coerced into a dinner date with Sarah 
and Aldous. The scene plays with incredible 
tension; Peter is uncomfortable, both women 
are secretly vying for his affection and Aldous 
just sits back. After the ice is broken and a 
few dozen bottles of wine are opened, the 
dialogue really flies as they debate the virtues 
of relationships, Aldous and Sarah clashing 
over the purpose of sex. As the conversation 
develops, we slowly realize Aldous, aloof and 
deviant in his own way, is probably the most 
honest of the bunch. If Segal is good at any-
thing other than jokes about pearl necklaces 
and bad shirts, it’s his penchant for crafting 
fully flawed but completely relatable charac-

H i p - h o p will make a n o t h e r 
stamp on cam-
pus on  April 18 at 
Porter’s Pub, with the 
arrival of a Southern 

California trio and one New York native. CashUsKing, 
DJ Exile, World and Sene are set to perform in an event 
hosted by UCSD’s Hip-Hop Club. Even though these 
names might be unfamiliar to some, it’s sure to be a 
worthwhile show.

CashUsKing is a relatively new MC out of Los Angeles. 
In a short amount of time and through work with cats 
like Blu, Ta’Raach and fellow performer DJ Exile, he has 
started to establish himself as a serious lyricist and a 
seriously dope MC. His rhyming partner and fellow Blu 

collaborator Sene, out of Brooklyn, will 
also be on deck 

to perform 

with CashUs and display some of his own material. 
The show will most likely benefit from the performers’ 
familiarity — all have already worked together directly 
or indirectly.

Exile is probably the most seasoned artist of the 
bunch. He had beats on the last Mobb Deep album, 
released his own LP, Dirty Science, and partnered with 
fellow Los Angeles native Blu to create one of 2007’s 
best LPs, Below the Heavens. 

He’ll be DJing for CashUs as well as performing 
a beat set of his own, displaying new and previously 
unheard material through his wizardry with the MPC 
sampler. Ex has also brought fellow producer World 
along to show off his own head-knocking creations. 
The show’s most exciting aspect, besides the fact that 
the acts are top-notch, is that this isn’t a standard per-
formance from an established group; instead, it features 
some of the best new artists in Southern California.

Friday, April 18, the Stage @ Porter’s Pub, open to every-
one 18+, free, limited capacity, show starts at 8:30 p.m.

NEW HOP HITS THE PUB

APATOW’S NEW BABY DROPS THE DRAMA, KEEPS THE COMEDY

To say that Bob and Greta are an unlikely match is an understatement. Bob favors 
rock guitar, while Greta is a fan of classical piano — somehow, it works for the two 
founders of the Hush Sound, an indie band from Chicago. Three albums after they 
met at the movies, the Hush Sound is on tour with Panic at the Disco, Motion City 

Soundtrack and Phantom Planet. When I arrived at 
the venue, it was hours before the show and over 90 
degrees outside. But Greta Salpeter took some time 
to chat with me in the air-conditioned cool of her 
tour bus.

The Guardian: How did The Hush Sound first start 
out?

Greta Salpeter: Well, Bob [Morris] and I met through mutual friends when I was 
maybe 13 and he was 17. He and I just ended up gravitating toward each other 
and we started to just write songs together for fun. We would sit around 
and make up these stories like “A guy comes into a bank with a gun” and 
then I would play really low on the piano like dun dun dun. It was just a 
whole lot of messing around. So anyway, we started doing that for fun 
— actually, when he got signed to his other band he told me that, 
“Now that I’m a signed musician, I’m not going to be able to record 
music with you because I’m contractually obligated to the other band.” 
That lasted about two weeks and finally Bob was like, “You know, screw 
it, let’s just make this work.” Very soon after, we found Darren [Wilson], our 
drummer and Chris [Faller] our bass player.

TG: And then, how were you discovered by Ryan Ross from Panic at the Disco and 
signed?

GS: Okay, I’ve never actually talked to Ryan about it, which is funny. I probably should 
know this story better, but apparently Ryan heard us on the Internet when we were 
streaming our first record. Ryan heard it and e-mailed Pete Wentz and said “Hey 
Pete, there’s this band from Chicago you should check out called the Hush Sound.

“Young @ Heart”
LANDMARK HILLCREST & LA JOLLA / OPENS FRIDAY

Sonic Youth tunes by senior citizens don’t seem to 
mesh, but hell if a choir of octo- and septuagenarians 
can’t convince you otherwise, belting out everything 
from old-school punk to modern-day rock. The title 
“Young@Heart” is intended to imply that age doesn’t 
equal vigor, and while it initially looks trite and “cute,” 
Stephen Walker’s emotional documentary chronicles 
the trials of the members as they rehearse, undergo 
surgeries and even die. Nonetheless, while it does 
confront the black abyss, it’s never morbid, but instead, 
touching and funny, offering a brand new look to “I 
Wanna Be Sedated.” (CM)

TOWER BAR / APRIL 19 / 8 P.M.

Chipmunk punk from the UK, coming to SD! Pre takes 
Deerhoof’s ADD riffs and Japanese chick wails, reshaping 
them into careless noise morsels. Though their delivery is 
blatantly too-cool, seen on rapid-fire anthem “And Prolapse,” 
the quintet speeds through tracks with scenester conviction. 
“Nope Fun” mirrors local art-punks Dmonstrations’ angular 
jams, now with cooing and odd moans from Akiko Matsuura’s 
mouth. Cute, yet disturbing. (CK)

sad-sack love story misses the curve
By Sonia Minden
Associate Hiatus Editor

I t’s hard to tell if “Smart People” is one of those self-dep-recating films that pokes fun at depressed intellectuals, or if it’s actually attempting to seem clever by beating 
its audience over the head with lofty witticisms and stilted 
dialogue. Unfortunately, while it might be going for the for-
mer impressive-without-trying genre (see: “Juno”), “Smart 
People” is more like a UCSD student 
— going overboard, yet still lacking 
certain depth.

For a flick that relies on compelling 
protagonists to boost a scatterbrained 
plot, its unlikable characters succeed 
only in driving an already slow sto-
ryline to a 95-minute halt. The script 
is hinged on flung-about contrivances 
that never culminate to any substantial 
point — we get the whole shpiel within 
the first 20 minutes.

A widowed, potbellied professor 
(Dennis Quaid) who treats his students 
(and everyone around him) like shit 

gets injured, and in his newfound disabled state he must rely 
on others to give him rides. This admittance of helplessness, 
after years of delusional self-reliance, eventually forces him to 
realize that he needs love and happiness just like everyone else 
— even dumb people.

 His socially impaired Young Republican daughter Vanessa 
(Ellen Page) does a fine job mirroring Quaid’s neuroticism, 
believing that having a perfect SAT score is better than hav-
ing friends. Of course, this changes when the professor’s 

sloppy adopted brother, 
Chuck (Thomas Haden 
Church) moves in. 
Chuck smokes weed, 
can’t drive and could 
care less about preten-

tious academia — but it doesn’t take long to realize that he is, 
in fact, the smartest of them all. Cheap, naked butt shots aside, 
the thinly veiled lesson here is that life isn’t just about routine 
obligations and blue-ribbon prizes. 

First-time director Noam Murro spends an unnecessarily 
long amount of time elaborating on the inexplicable relation-
ship that flourishes when Chuck introduces Vanessa to (gasp!) 
alcohol and (gasp!) fun, and teaches her the value of taking 
the stick out of her ass once in a while. But amid all of this, 
Vanessa’s father also falls in love — albeit a sad sack’s idea 
of love — with former-student-turned-neurosurgeon Janet 
(Sarah Jessica Parker).

These implausible parallel relationships may have made 
for intriguing filmmaking, but somehow they fall short of 
compelling. This is mainly because: 1) We ultimately just feel 
sorry for dead-battery, witch-wrinkled Sarah Jessica Parker, 
and 2) There’s too much disrupting subplot for either romance 
to develop meaning. Good thing there’s a painfully indicative 
soundtrack telling us when to laugh and/or cry (cue the senti-
mental acoustic music when something important happens).

Still, there are a few glimmering moments of intelligence 
in this try-too-hard film, and the backhanded sass sometimes 
compensates for lagging characters. Just don’t call it “smart” 
— you might inflate its ego.

ters. Sarah is pompous and sneaky, but she’s 
also fragilely human. Aldous may only have 
sex on his mind, but he’s unbelievably kind to 
Peter, even offering McBrayer’s character some 
bedroom advice.

This is all a testament to Segal’s screenplay, 
so well defined and deliberate. The film itself 
suffers from moments of choppy editing — as 
certain scenes start to work and we begin to 
get into their groove, we’re suddenly jolted into 
another moment and feel as if there’s dialogue 
we missed. The theatrical cut looks as if there’s 
an unrated, extended version waiting for a 
DVD release, where sequences are given room 
to breathe. There’s also a point where we feel 
the film has overstayed its welcome, throwing 
in one too many little episodes which would 
make fine extras on the aforementioned DVD, 
without taking away from the story, and leav-
ing room in the main feature to tie up more 
than a few loose ends.

But these are minor quibbles. The grand 
finale of “Marshall” — a lavish musical num-
ber performed by muppets — is one of the 

more absurd and ridiculously funny ones you 
have seen in a long time. And it hits the right 
note too: All of Peter’s anxiety and curious 
proclivities are bound to swell up at one point. 
That this point is surrounded by an adapta-
tion of the Dracula legend with Sesame Street 
extras makes it all the more amusing, and lifts 
the film out of cliche hell. It’s been a long time 
since we’ve had a straight comedy, uneven as it 
is, that keeps us tuned in and laughing at our 
own sympathies.

Muppet Madness Takes Paradise
▶ MARSHALL, from page 10

Pacino Psych Thriller Dead on Arrival
By Charles Nguyen
Senior Staff Writer

The opening of Jon Avnet’s psych thriller 
plops a drunken Al Pacino in the middle of a 
crowded college-age bar, where he shimmy-
shakes to a clubbed-up remix of Usher’s “Yeah.” 
For the next “88 Minutes,” he’ll stretch his rip 
‘n’ roar style as far as it can go, but isn’t mix-
ing Usher and Pacino bad enough? The film 
implodes as time ticks away, failing to drum up 
enough nuggets to tantalize until the inevitable 
end; we instead do our own countdown, want-
ing to purge ourselves of whatever secret Pacino 
is chasing. 

The film begins during a let-loose night for 
Pacino’s Jack Gramm, a forensic psychiatrist 
and college professor who is celebrating the 
impending execution of Jon Forster, who strings 
up women and bleeds 
them dry as the serial-
killing “Seattle Slayer.” 
Gramm’s testimony as 
a psychiatrist was key 
to locking Forster away, 
so while the tipsy prof 
rubs elbows barside 
with enamored 20-year-
old students, Forster 
feeds his lust for venge-
ful machinations. Life 
unravels for Gramm 
when, the next day, the 
FBI comes knocking, 
his students start dying 
and Forster receives a 
stay of execution. And 
of course, the biggest 
problem is the call with 
the gravely voice: “You 
have 88 minutes to live. 
Tick-tock.”

As a filmic device, Avnet’s countdown does 
little to tense up the drama or animate the char-
acters. Gramm keeps the death threat to himself 
for much of the film, zipping around Seattle’s 
dreary sceneries in a scramble for clues. The 
supporting characters zip too, but only around 
Gramm himself, needlessly pecking at him like 
flies at a trap before they get ensnared in strings 

of glue and glop. 
It’s hard not to be mesmerized as Pacino 

navigates the screen. His presence is absolute 
in “88 Minutes,” straddling every scene and 
nearly every line. Avnet doesn’t leash the hot-
blooded Pacino, letting him throw his impul-
sive stagecraft around, particularly in gleeful 
moments when Gramm faces down Forster. 
But the best Pacino has always proved to be a 
more muted one, when he was icy as Michael in 
“The Godfather” or calculating as Will Dormer 
in “Insomnia.” Avnet’s Pacino lacks that under-
handed fortitude, partly because his character 
doesn’t take the time to sit and stew, but mostly 
because he devours the film’s weaker side char-
acters with his frenetic, all-engulfing aura.

Avnet resurrects bad TV with the support-
ing cast, bringing in Amy Brenneman (“Judging 
Amy”) and Alicia Witt (“Law & Order: 

Criminal Intent”) as 
Pacino’s partners in 
his race against time. 
The two give terri-
bly coined perfor-
mances: Brenneman 
as Gramm’s gay sec-
retary Shelly Barnes 
and Witt as his 
cutesy student Kim 
Cummings. More 
characters come into 
play as the clock ticks 
on and Gramm’s sus-
pect list grows lon-
ger. The culprit could 
be the other lesbian 
Lauren Douglas, 
Gramm’s sharpest 
student, played by 
Leelee Sobieski. Or 
it could be his most 

outspoken one, Mike Stempt played by another 
bad TV veteran Benjamin McKenzie (“The 
OC”). Even with the structure of time, the 
film’s many red herrings writhe around each 
other in too jumbled a manner. By the end of 
“88 Minutes,” Avnet’s big reveal halts a ride that 
started oddly, dipped around in the middle, 
then slowed to a stop — it’s not the track a 
thriller should follow.

Hush Makes Pick on Boy Bands and Bears
[...] Anyways, so Pete listened to it and he sent us a mes-
sage from his Sidekick that had very bad grammar and it 
said, “I am Pete from band Fall Out Boy. What band are 
you up to?” He basically came over, met with us, said he’d 
like to sign us and we were so impressed with the Fueled 
By Ramen family and just how warm and enthusiastic 
they were so we just said, “yes.”

TG: What are the perks of being on tour?

GS: The perks, I mean, first of all just meeting so many 
incredible bands on tour and getting all these new influ-
ences. It’s just learning as much as you can about other 
people and then, obviously, playing a show and being able 
to play the music live and connect with the people who 
are at the shows. (In a low voice) You know, the chicks. 
The chicks and the champagne. (Laughs) 

TG: Did your parents ever discourage you from pursuing 
music growing up?

GS: No! They were a little hesitant at first because it’s so 
easy to get taken advantage of in the music industry, but 
we were fortunate enough to immediately fall into good 
hands. I remember it was the day that I took the ACT, I 
was a junior in high school and when I came home Pete 
came over to my house and just sat down and talked to 
my parents and was very well spoken and very intelligent. 
He immediately impressed my parents and they thought 

it was a good idea.

TG: It’s like he was asking you out on a date or some-
thing.

GS: I know!

TG: Would you rather be on the cover of Rolling Stone 
or Time magazine?

GS: Oh, I don’t know. I don’t read Time magazine. It’s a 
really conservative magazine, isn’t it? Rolling Stone or 
Time? I would rather be on Rolling Stone.

Chris Faller: Now? Rolling Stone is lame, I gotta say.

GS: True. Lindsay Lohan’s been on the cover of Rolling 
Stone.

TG: Backstreet Boys or *NSYNC?

GS: *NSYNC. Oh yeah. That was my first concert.

TG: Would you rather play a large arena concert or a 
small venue?

GS: It depends. I prefer smaller clubs because you can 
actually see who you’re playing for and the sound is just 
so much better. When you play in an arena, while it’s very 

exciting with that many people, you can’t hear any-
thing and they can’t really hear you ... I know from 
when I saw *NSYNC when I was 10 that I wish I was 
closer to the action. 

TG: Would you rather be a polar 
bear or a grizzly bear?

GS: The polar bear’s 
environment is rapidly 
being destroyed so I’d

Man Man
■ Rabbit Habits
ANTI

W elcome to Man Man’s third carnival-rock spec-tacle, Rabbit Habits, a finely honed blend of hobo weirdness and indie introspection from one of 
Philadelphia’s finest experimental outfits. The territory 
isn’t new — ringleader Honus Honus and his band of 
bearded tricksters thoroughly explored these charming 
back alleys on past release Six Demon Bag, but now they’ve 
ditched most of the percussive bustle and noisy charades 
in favor of meticulously fat-free pop.

The show starts with the immediately bouncy “Mister 
Jung Stuffed,” the feminine background vox and Honus’ 
cracking yelps still intact, along with a tight bass/organ punch 
to keep the jam from getting too out of hand. Then we’ve got 
“Hurly/Burly,” whose jittery helium-pitched chorus holds 
back an otherwise inspired and eclectic marimba and gui-
tar-lick frenzy. Onward to a cartoon-montage intro leading 
into the character-driven track “The Ballad of Butter Beans,” 
which concerns a first-person narrator chasing B.B. for her 

own sinister ends. Also, a New Orleans funeral march finds 
its way into “Big Trouble,” a morose take on mundane living 
through the eyes of a man/zombie lamenting his bad luck 
with girls. Slightly to the band’s detriment, the tune never gets 
truly heartfelt because of their preoccupation with weirdo 
shrieks and spaced-out sound effects. 

But the minimal piano ballad “Doo Right” serves as an 
interlude to creepier and ever-polished fare; for the rest of the 
voyage, Man Man attempts nearly everything from makeshift 
kitchen-sink techno on “El Azteca” to jauntily crafted nug-
gets like “Rabbit Habits” and the instant-single strut of “Top 
Drawer,” a perfect entry point on the Man Man train. This 
sums up Rabbit Habits perfectly in relation to group‘s other 
records: pick this one up first to ease yourself with the crafted 
Tom Waits-lite stylistics, and then move on to Six Demon 
Bag’s manic delivery for a taste of the harder stuff.

Gnarls Barkley
■ The Odd Couple
DOWNTOWN/ATLANTIC

A lthough Gnarls Barkley’s experimental blend of rock, rap and neo-soul in St. Elsewhere was all the rage in 2006, Cee-Lo and Danger Mouse’s collaborative suc-
cess certainly didn’t end there. The Odd Couple — a fitting 
title for the producer and multi-instrumentalist duo whose 
theatrical excellence has enchanted fans with costumes from 
the “Wizard of Oz” and “Star Wars” — is insistently up to par 
with their imaginatively illustrious freshman album as yet 
another delightfully rendered schizophrenic fairytale.

Aiming to outdo St. Elsewhere’s Grammy-winning 
“Crazy,” the break-beat syncopation and polyrhythm of 
“Run (I’m a Natural Disaster)” incite the b-boy/b-girl inside 
us, yearning to bust out toprocks and headspins on broken-
down cardboard boxes. On second thought, listening to 
Cee-Lo frantically rant and rave “I have got a beast at bay … 
Run children/Run for your life” also makes us want to punch 
someone in the face for no reason whatsoever. But whether 

you’re rocking it old school or embarking on an arbitrarily 
violent rampage, you’ll love “Run”’s drug-like adrenaline 
rush running through your veins.

Though much slower than “Run”’s crack-induced tempo, 
“Who’s Gonna Save My Soul” also bubbles with top-20 rota-
tion potential. Meshing Danger Mouse’s electronic loops 
and beats and Cee-Lo’s soulful Motown voice and menacing 
lyrical intensity (“Who’s gonna save my soul now … / Oooo 
I know I’m out of control now hoohooo/Tired enough to lay 
my own soul down”), the song is a moody, dramatic tem-
plate typical of these musical masterminds. 

Not to be mistaken as a lackluster attempt to stray from 
traditional genres, Gnarls Barkley’s The Odd Couple is defi-
nitely in a category of its own that deserves props for its col-
lective, multi-leveled intuitiveness and creativity.

school at the University of Chicago 
and Patterson will intern at a law 
office before enrolling in law school. 

For these student athletes, perhaps 
the best part of the ceremony was get-
ting recognition for their hard class-
room work as well as their athletic 
achievements. Ward, the left-handed 
ace for the nationally ranked women’s 

softball team, enjoyed being seen as 
more than just a jock at an otherwise 
academic-focused school.

“Most of the time at this school 
you are recognized for being an ath-
lete,” Ward said. “It’s nice to get recog-
nized for being a student.”

Many of the honored athletes are 
upperclassmen, and as their sports 
careers come to a close here at UCSD, 

they must face the prospect of life 
after school. Luckily for these stu-
dents, they have been able to domi-
nate the classroom just as much as 
their athletic competition, leaving 
them in a position not only to handle 
but to excel at their chosen fields.

mate Patrick Bauer, who ended up 
tied with Cal State Stanislaus’ Jesse 
Contreras with a cumulative score of 
215, good for one under. Junior Billy 
Olsen led the Tritons, shooting an 
even par third round of 72 to finish 
at 216 (+8), which was good for a tie 
for 16th individually.

Fellow junior Nathan Phan fin-
ished second on the team with a 227 
(+11) that put him in a tie for 39th. 
Phan managed to improve his score 
with each successive round, begin-
ning with a first round 78, followed 
by rounds of 75 and 74. Phan has 
been UCSD’s most consistent golfer 
this season, with a 75.6 scoring aver-
age and a .694 winning percentage. 
He also has posted the Tritons’ best 
round of the season, shooting a 69 
at the Sonoma State Invitational in 
October. 

“There’s no secret to my game,” 
Phan said. “I work hard in prac-
tice, and never get satisfied with the 
strides I make. I always feel like my 
game can improve, and with that 
attitude, I’ve managed to have some 
success that I hope can continue as 
we approach the most important part 
of our season.”

Freshman Keith Okasaki finished 
in a tie for 56th with a score of 233 
(+17). After starting strongly with 

a one over 73, the freshman stum-
bled down the stretch, finishing with 
rounds of 81 and 79. Right behind 
him was sophomore Austin Alfonso, 
who shot a cumulative 234 to end 
in a tie for 60th. He also shot a first 
round 73, but finished with scores of 
80 and 81 in the final two rounds, 
respectively.  Junior Noah Moss shot 

a 242 (+26), which put him in 76th 
place, as he shot rounds of 78, 83, 
and 81.

Head coach Mike Wydra has 
developed quite a program at UCSD 
during his 29 years, but last August he 
may have received the school’s high-
est honor when Golf Digest Magazine 
named UCSD men’s golf as the top 
Division-II program in the nation in 

their annual rankings of the top 400 
golf schools in the country. The rank-
ing takes six factors into account, 
including academics and climate, and 
looks at colleges in Division I, II and 
III. Overall, UCSD finished as the 
21st best program in the country, the 
top Division-II school in academics 
and the best school of all divisions 
in climate. When asked about the 
rankings, Wydra deflected the com-
pliment toward his team.

“All the credit goes to the team 
and the achievements they’ve made, 
both on the course and in the class-
room,” he said.

With no seniors leaving the team 
that earned that honor, the awards may 
only be the beginning for the Tritons. 
Last year, UCSD finished their season 
by placing 6th in the NCAA Division 
II West Regional, missing out on 
the National Championship tourna-
ment for the third straight year. This 
year, the team hopes to make that 
tournament for the first time since 
2003-04. The Tritons must finish first 
at the CCAA Championships and 
NCAA Super Regionals on May 5 to 
7 to gain admission into the Division 
II Championships in Houston that 
begin on May 20.

as compiled by the U.S. Track & 
Field and Cross Country Coaches 
Association, has UCSD’s women in 
first place with the Triton men com-
ing in at sixth place. Last season, the 
women finished in second and the 
men did not even crack the top-10, 
signifying how much the 2008 squad 
accomplished.

“In most sports there are power 
rankings where it’s just coaches vot-
ing, but in track everybody submits 
their best marks in all events and the 
teams are then matched up head to 
head,” men’s head coach Tony Salerno 
said. “It indicates the overall strength 
of the program for how we score at 
dual meets so it allows us to compare 
ourselves against national teams that 
we would normally never compete 
against.”

The Tritons will participate in 
three different competitions spread 
out all over Southern California this 
week. UCSD’s distance runners are 
currently competing in the Azusa 
Heptathlon/Decathlon, which started 
on April 15 and ends today. After the 
specialized meet, almost all of the 
team will participate in the Beach 
Invitational at Cerritos College on 
April 19. Along with those two 
meets, some of the Triton’s top ath-

letes will travel to Walnut, Calif. for 
the Mt. Sac Relays, the site of the 
National Championships in early 
May. Participating in the Mt. SAC 
competition will allow a select few 
from the Tritons to get comfortable at 
a stadium where they hope to domi-
nate at nationals. 

“These are the meets to sharpen us 
up,” Ahner said. “This is the time that 
we are starting to get into our peak so 
these meets are a great opportunity to 
roll us into the conference champion-
ships and nationals after that.”

With such high rankings and sea-
son-long worth of momentum, the 
Tritons look poised to make a strong 

run in the remaining few weeks of 
regular season competition before 
charging into the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Championships 
and the national finals. 

“Right now we just need to keep 
the feeling of just going for it, to 
let yourself compete and not think 
too much,” Ahner said. “It is always 
easy for UCSD students to think too 
much, so it’s important to just go in 
with complete confidence.”

The men, who have not had an all-
american since the 2006 campaign, 
have a legitimate shot this season to 
finish in the top three at the CCAA 
finals and send a sizable contingent 
to nationals. The women hope to 
retain their No. 1 ranking for the rest 
of the year and make a run at the 
program’s first Division-II National 
Championship title.

“The only challenge for the women 
will be the fact that the rules allow us 
to only bring 32 athletes to the con-
ference championships, so there will 
be people who would certainly do 
great but have to get left at home,” 
Salerno said. “As a team, having too 
many qualified athletes is definitely 
the best type of problem to have.”

one final win.
After the final match of their regu-

lar season, Ring and the men were 
admittedly disappointed with the loss 
but ended on a reflective note. 

“The message was: what did we 
accomplish this year?,” Ring said. 
“We defeated the defending national 
champs. We beat UCSB in three games 
just to name a couple. The guys are 
excited for what is to come.”

The future looks bright for a 
team that will bring back all but one 
player next season as well as two 
injured starters from the previous 
year. Sophomore outside hitter Will 
Ehrman exited early this season due 
to surgery and sophomore middle 
blocker Adrian Guthals went down 
late last season during practice with 
knee problems.

Ring sees the returning players 
adding to the already deep core of 

guys at both positions. 
“Will is such a fiery competitor 

and Adrian was our top middle last 
year until he got hurt,” he said. “We 
thought we’d get Adrian back this year 
but that didn’t happen. He’s been prac-
ticing but hasn’t played. [Will] is going 
to help us from the service line and is 
a guy you like to play with.”

Seven Place in Top Five at UCLA

By Robert Ingle
Contributing Writer

The UCSD Department of 
Intercollegiate Athletics recognized 
several of its student athletes at a lun-
cheon held at the UCSD Faculty Club 
on April 14 in celebration of National 
Student-Athlete Day. Seniors Todd 
Bettisworth, Randelle Bundy, Diane 
Dunn, Meaghan Noud, Henry 
Patterson, David Payne and Melissa 
Ward, juniors Ryan Bailey, Garrett 
Imeson, Jillian Sola and Caryn 
Urbandczyk and sophomore Steven 
Donohoe were honored for their ath-
letic and academic accomplishments 
as well as community service projects 
on and off campus. All of the hon-
ored student athletes have earned 
both Provost and Athletic Director’s 
Honor Roll while being important 
members of their respective teams. 

Softball’s Bundy, a senior majoring 
in environmental systems with a 3.69 
GPA, was the student athlete who 
spoke on behalf of those honored. In 
particular, Bundy chose to share the 
credit for their success with all of the 
adults that play such crucial roles in 
the lives of student athletes. 

“Most of this is due to the won-
derful coaches and administrators 
that are here at this school who have 
helped us and stood by our side, 
even if it’s been difficult at times,” 
she said. 

In addition to coaches and admin-
istrators, the student athletes were 
quick to recognize their teammates 

as being just as dedicated in their aca-
demic endeavors. Noud, a first team 
All-CCAA selection for the women’s 
basketball team, understands the 
challenge that constant travel can play 
in keeping up with UCSD’s demand-
ing schoolwork.

“Everybody works really hard,” 
Noud, a senior biology major with a 
3.62, said. “We’re studying on every 
road trip, and I really think that it 
shows a lot with all these athletes; 
that they can do this sport and com-
pete with other students academically 
as well.” 

While the athletes were quick 
to give credit to others who helped 
them, they were also appreciative of 
the hard-earned award. Patterson, a 
member of the CCAA Tournament 
Champion men’s basketball team, was 
excited to be honored academically 
so soon after accomplishing such an 
important athletic goal.

“It feels great,” Patterson, a senior 
political science major with a 3.4 
GPA, said. “To be able to carry [such 
an academic load], regardless of if 
you are playing sports or not, I think 
it’s a tremendous feat.” 

The distinguished group also 
went beyond the assumed norm of 
academics and sports as all honored 
recipients brought impressive resumes 
of community service. From work-
ing with programs ranging from the 
After-School All-Stars to Habitat for 
Humanity, the honorees took on a 
load that demonstrates just how much 
can be accomplished as a student ath-
lete at UCSD.

In all cases, these athletes will 
continue with the dedication that 
brought them recognition, some even 
at higher levels of education. Noud

TRACK AND FIELD — With the 
most hectic week of the 2008 season 
approaching, the Tritons took part 
in the UCLA Rafer Johnson/Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee meet on April 10 to 
12 and placed seven athletes in the 
top five in their respective fields. The 
three-day event was held at UCLA’s 
historic Drake Stadium and hosted 
many of the Division I national lead-
ers, yet the Tritons had no problems 
holding their own in the tough com-
petition.

“I was very satisfied with how the 
team did this past weekend,” women’s 
head coach Darcy Ahner said. “I feel 
like there were a lot of great indi-
vidual performances and overall they 
had a great feel of intensity.”

The women were led by sopho-
more jumper Linda Rainwater’s first 
place finish in the open high jump, 
as her leap of 5’05.25” was .25 inches 
higher than that of Sacramento State’s 
Moira Johnson. After setting the all-
time UCSD record at last weekend’s 
Divisional Challenge, senior pole-
vaulter Christina Sloyer placed third 
at the UCLA meet with a mark of 
11’7.75”. Senior jumper Whitney 
Johnson earned a fourth-place fin-
ish in the invitational triple jump, 
an event that was won by UCLA’s 
Division-I All-American Renee 
Williams.

On the men’s side, sophomore 
jumper Casey Ryan took third place 
in the open high jump with his mark 
of 6’6”. The other top-five for the 
Triton men was third place junior 
distance runner Jake LeVieux, with 
a time of 9:34.86 in the 3,000-meter 
steeplechase, also good for third 
place. LeVieux’s time in the event 
earned him CCAA Athlete of the 
Week honors, the fifth such award for 
a member of the track and field team 
this season. Ahner was especially 

proud of how the Tritons were not 
mentally intimidated by such top-
notch competition.

“[The UCLA meet] definitely is a 
different type of meet,” Ahner said. 
“Drake stadium has a real big time 
feel to it and our divisional chal-

lenge last weekend was a home meet 
so there was a lot of comfort for us. 
They handled the meet really well 
and didn’t get intimidated at all.”

VOLLEYBALL — The Tritons aren’t 
allowing their uninspiring end 
to the season dampen all the suc-
cess they achieved over the course 
of the year. Despite dropping their 
final two games to No. 3 Cal State 
Northridge and No. 14 UC Santa 
Barbara, the Tritons had one of their 
best campaigns in program history 
with season sweeps of UC Irvine and 
University of the Pacific, a win over 
UCLA and a three-game sweep of the 
Gauchos. UCSD also reached double-
digit wins for only the fourth time in 
the program’s history.

Despite these accomplishments, 
UCSD has still failed to make it 
to the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation playoffs. That is the next 
step according to head coach Kevin 
Ring.

“In all the years I have been 
involved at UCSD, we have always 
wanted to make it to playoffs,” he 
said. “But that has never really been 
a reality. For this team though, it’s a 
serious goal to make it there. Even 
some of the matches we’ve lost this 
season have been very competi-
tive and we know we can play with 
them.”

The Tritons finished 10-19 over-
all with a 6-16 record in the MPSF, 

arguably the toughest conference in 
the nation. As proof of its difficulty, 
the MPSF claims 10 of the top 15 
teams in the country according to 
the American Volleyball Coaches 
Association.

Ring recognizes the challenges 
that playing such a tough conference 
brings, but nevertheless loves the 
opportunities that come with it.

“We are at a point now with this 
program that we can beat teams with 
just our everyday play,” he said. “Our 
opponent doesn’t have to play poorly 
for us to win anymore.”

The two losses to the Matadors 
and Gauchos didn’t come as a sur-
prise to the team. Northridge was 
competing for the regular season 
conference title, and it showed as 
the Matadors plowed through UCSD 
in straight sets 30-21, 30-19 and 
30-24. The Tritons had no answer 
for the Matador offense and found 
themselves lost during serve receive 
without their starting libero, junior 
Eric Leserman, who was out with a 
hairline fracture in his wrist.

“He has been a starter all year 
long and that made things a little 
more difficult,” Ring said. “Eric is 
our captain and is really coming into 
his own.”

UCSD didn’t fare much better 
against the Gauchos, a team it beat 
in straight sets earlier in the season. 
The Tritons fell 31-33, 30-17, 31-29, 
32-30, with multiple opportunities 
to close out games three and four but 
couldn’t finish. Up 28-22 in game 
four, UCSB battled back to steal the 
game, giving its coach of 30 years

GOLF — The Tritons took part in 
the Buzzini/Cal State Stanislaus 
Invitational, the final tuneup before 
next week’s California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Championships 
on April 14 and 15 and finished 
in 13th place at the 16-team tour-
nament. The three-round, two-day 
tournament was held at Turlock Golf 
and Country Club, where Sonoma 
State University won the event with a 
score of 872 (+8). UCSD finished at 
916, 52 shots over par. 

The Tritons opened the tourna-
ment with a 301, then shot 309 in the 
second round before concluding the 
tournament with a 306. Each team 
brought a squad of at least five golf-
ers, with Sonoma State and Cal State 
University Stanislaus bringing six, 
and Barton College bringing seven. 
The best four scores from each round 
created each team’s total.  

Sonoma State’s Jarin Todd posted 
the best individual score with a 208

out of 83 to finish the tournament
