UCSD Professor Fired in Kenya 
WILDLIFE: Political 
factor may have 
motivated dismi al 
By Annette E, de la Llana 
Guardian Reporter 

For the second time in four 
months , CSD Professor 
David Western was fired from 
his position as direc tor of 
Kenya 's wildlife preserves. 

UCSD Biology Professor 
David Woodruff said the rea-
sons behind the termination 
appear to he political intrigue. 

"Western was fired for polit-
ical reasons that had nothing to 
do with hi s successfu I manage-
ment of Kenyan wildlife ser-
vice," said Woodruff, who is a 
friend and co lleague of 
We~tern . 

Woodruff said that Western 

resisted effort s hy the Kenyan 
government to start mining and 
hui1ulllg hotels on land that was 
reserved for herds of elephants. 
lions, giraffes, zebras and other 
animals and plant life. 

Woodruff also said that in 
order get someone who would 
permit the mining and building 
on the preserve lands, Kenyan 
President Daniel arap Moi 
released Western from his posi -
tion and appointed Richard 
Leakey, a renowned anthropol -
ogist. Leakey at one time held 
thi s position, but Moi lired him 
for emhezzlement in 1994. 

According to Woodruff, 
after Western replaced Leakey, 
he restored the money that 
Leakey had embealed by 
obtaining donations from the 
World Bank. 

Woodruff said that Leakey, 

angered oyer his termination, 
sought help in family friend 
and Moi asso<.:iate harle ' 

jonjo. Woodruff also said 
Njonjo inlluen<.:ed events lead-
ing to Western 's firing and 
Leakey 's replacement of hi m. 
However, traveling in another 
country, Moi was unaware of 
thi s action. Upon returning, 
Moi had Western reinstated. 

Four months later, the 
Kenyan president fired Western 
and reappointed Leakey as 
apart of an apparent plan to 
develop the preserves. 

"[Western I was caught in 
the middle of the wrruption of 
Kenyan politics," Woodruff 
sa id . "He is a quiet field ecolo-
gist. He is an unlikely person to

president 's first tenn. 

Reich dis<.:ussed the current state of thc 
Ameri<.:an ewnomy and the possibility of a 
worldwide recession. Reich said that he 
hoped that the Federal Reserve Board 

hairman Alan Greenspan would lower 
interest rates by a full percentage point 
before the end of the year in order to spur 
ewnomic growth. 

"There needs to be a coordinated lower-
ing of interest rates in major industrial 
nations," Reich said. 

Reich also spoke of a new global e<.:o-
nomic order and stressed the importan<.:e of 
globalization, education and technology. He 
also said that he believes edu<.:ation and

LGBTA Celebration Sets a 
Positive Example for UCSD 

UCS D's Lesbian , Gay, Bisexual and Transgender 
Association (LG BTA ), and groups like it around the 
country, are recogni zing Thursday, OCL. 8 as National 
Coming Out Day. To celebrate the tenth year of thi s 
annual event, LGBTA is stagi ng a noontime celebra-
tion at the Price Center. 

Coming out is often a s tressful and emoti onal 
experience . Organizations like the LGBTA and 
events like Nati onal Coming Out Day provide a com-
fortabl e and unde rstanding e nvironm ent in which 
individuals can stop hiding from soc ie ty. 

UCSD is not a campus where stude nts should be 
ashamed of who they are. It is not a place where peo-
p le shou ld fee l the need to blend in. On a campus that 
promotes, even seeks out, diversilY, students should 
be encouraged to celebrate the ir individuality and 
uniqueness. 

Even more, students and facu lty should ce lebrate 
themselves, whatever that might be. Today's celebra-
tion sets an example for the degree of acceplClnce and 
enthus iasm the Guardian hopes to see throughout 
campus. 

Porter's Pub Expansion 
Improves UCSD Community 

Tw weeks ago, CS D students reaped the bene-
(it s of the alcohol license ex pansion at Porter's Pub 
and were ullowed to take the ir alcoholic drinks onlo 
the Pub 's pati o. The area in the Pub where students 
may legall y consume alcoholic beverages, one of 
only two places o n campus w here students can do 
so, has more than doubled as a result of th is exten -
s io n. 

This change recogni zes that studen ts over the age 
of 21 have a need to sociali ze while on campus. The 
Guardiall welcomes Ihe ex pansion o f the alcohol 
license as an important step toward the formation of 
a more live ly stude nt life on campus. 

Many on-campus ac tiviti es that are des igned 
designed 10 create a sense of community cate r onl y 
to firs t- and second-yea r s tudents w ho li ve in 
UCSD 's dorms and apartments. An outdoor soc ial 
venue, such as the Porter 's Pub patio, will certainly 
attract many juniors, seniors and graduate students. 
Drinking-age Tritons who may feel di sconnected 
from the UCSD community now have a place to 
gather and socialize.

PARKING CONDITIONS 
WORSEN As SCHOOL EXPANDS 
COMMENTARY: 
Even if you ' re lucky 
enough to find a parking 
spot on campus, you'll 
still need to hike to class 
By Walt Dickinson 
Editor in Chief 

If you ' re like me, you've noti ~ed 
it"s gelling worse . 

Finding a parking spOI at UCS D 
has hecome more difli~ult than gett jng 
up for that 8 a.m. bio lecture the day 
alkr thc Sun God Fesli val. Okay, 
there's no class Ihe day after Sun God, 
hut you get my poi nl. 

It wasn' t an issuc during my lirst 
year when I was li ving, ea ting and 
working on campus. Venturing beyond 
the boundaries of the school was a rare 
and strange journey. Without any per-
sonal conveyan~c, I was for~ed 10 rely 
on buses, bicycles and friends' cars. 

Midway through my second year I 
was fortunate enough to a~quire a car. 
II was nothing much to look at, lind it 
had its share of $800 repairs during the 
first few months. Even though I still 
lived on campus and didn 't use my ~ar 
ali that often, I bought a parking per-
mit for the damn thing and tried to 
park as dose to my Matthews apart -
ment as pOss ihle. 

It was during my third year at 
UCSD Ihat I rca lly starled 10 appreci -
ate my car. I was dri ving hack and 
forth hetween school and lairemont 
every day, and allh ugh I was shelling 
out what seemed like a lot of money, I 
could usually lind a parki ng spot in 
one of the lots ncar class. 

This ycar the situation changed for 
the worsc. 

It hit me ahoUl a week ago wh.:n I 
pulled onto carnpu ~ carl for.1 mc.:l-
ing. I wa, ,uppo,cd to he there hy 
II :30 a.m .. so I got thcre ahout an hour 
early to park, walk in, get coffee, ctc. 

It made me curious as 
to where my $99 per 
quarter goes, and why 
there hasn't been a 
new parking lot built 
in the last four years 
while the 
undergraduate 
population continues 
Its steep rise. 

See if any of Ihis sounds familiar. 
10:30 a.m. 

My deSlination is the Student Center, 
so I need to find the closest student 
parking. Now, one might assumc that 
the Student Center might have somc 
student parking nearby, but it doesn't. It 
has Lot I 13, which is small and has per-
petually fi II cd mctercd spaccs. I' m 
aware of this and have co rne to terms 
with iI, so I hcad directly for Lol 508, 
the Medical School parking lot. 
10:35 a.m. 

Mosl of the spaces are full , butI'm 
not really .:oncerned. De'pite the fa~t 
thaI thi, lot i,n't very clo,c to anylhing

Howcver. IIIIS 101 i, wry hig, and I've 
ncver ,een il completely full of ~ars . 

10:50 a.m. 
The cntire 101 is full. I' m shaking 

my hcad in disbelief and wondering if 
I shou ld hunt down someone who may 
be walking to his or her car. 
11:00 a.m. 

Fo llowing pcdestrians is deemed a 
frui tless effort , as Ihere are 100 many 
other ca rs doing the same thing. The 
odds agai nst linding someone pulling 
out arc worse than being st ruck hy 
lightning. 
11:05 a.m. 

I' m heading up to Revelle. My col-
lege has two lots (102 and 103), bOlh 
of which are almost always packed 
during school hours. Once in a great 
while a spot can be found in the south-
west comer. Thesc spots are no prize, 
though, as they arc far away from the 
center of campus. 
11:20 a.m. 

I don't experience much shock or 
amazement to find these two lots 
devoid of spots but full of yet-
un parked cars with frustrated students 
driving in slow, monotonous circles. 
It 's time for thc nex t 101. 
11:30 a.m. 

I am now late and hopeles 'Iy 
·earching Eleanor Roosevelt 's Lot 
405. I reali ze the futility of my search, 
circle through the small lot quickl y 
and head back to the Student Centcr. 
11:40 a.m. 

I' ve parked in a loading zone in the 
Student Center 101 just long enough to 
leI the pcople I was mceting with know 
what was going on . Had l heen late to 
a class Ihe professor wouldn 't havc 
heen nearly as understanding. It occurs 
to me that there isn' t a parking space 
on the cntire south side f campu~.

AMERICAN VALUES ROOTED IN THE DOLLAR 
COMMENTARY:

By Simone Santini 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

You ' \c heard thaI ~oou 01'

,aid that people just don 't helievc

None of thi s is truc. however. The 
only real American va lue is money. 
and it seems to be doing exceplion-

Only money and wea lth yield 
socia l res pe~t and acceptance. 
Everybouy looks to their urround-

ICY" hasic needs (food, waler and a 
reasonable shclter), we desire the 
things that wi ll gi ve us slature in 
our communit y. In the United 
States, this stature. thi s power. 
comes with money. 

You may have heard a different 
story, of course. You may have 
hea rd of American values such as 
honesty, integrit y, family commil -
ment , morality and so on. 

Hones ty is enforced, at least in 
the form of obeying the law. In a 
larger ethical sense however, thi s 
issue is considcrahl y more ~ompli ­
cated. Ethi~a l honesty appears to 
be quite ·closc to that olher va lue 
thaI peop le call integrilY. So let us 

associate ethica l honesty wi th 
integrilY·

TV ENGRAINS PHILOSOPHICAL IDEALS SPACES: Af~er parking, pre-
pare to take a hike 
Continued from pag_ 4 

COMMENTARY: 
Television stresses the 
importance of putting 
forth a "good image" 
By Brlndusa Cracluneanu 
Contributing Opinion Woter 

I was once told hy a high 
school teacher, who I otherwise 
respec t, that I would make a poor 
philosopher. 

"Whatever you do, don' t major 
in philosophy. Please," she said. 

The comment closed a 1m of 
doors for me. I can still hear the 
BANG of the door slamming, 
along with the sad , di shelieving 

que~ti on : Can I at ""1St he a skcp-
tic'! Mayhc a sophisl'1 

So, in co llege I hecame a com-
munications major wi th the hope 
to one day make the world a lTlore 
wildly phi losophical place hy 
designing television commercials 
and advertisements. 

It may not sound like the kind 
of joh thai mothers go to chu rch 
and light candles about. I have not, 
however, set out 10 save livcs or he 
the lirst person to bui ld a human 
dwell ing on Ihe moon, I refuse to 
go down in hi story or bask in the 
glow of popular glory, All I want 
for myself is 10 he a new-age 
philosopher mass producing high 
thought~ in Ihe I wesl place of all : 
your lelevision. 

There are pcople you do not 
know (and given a chance to meet 
them you'd probahly decline the 
invitat ion) who have mude you 
ask epi stemological que~t ions !'it 

lor the end of the mill ennium . 
Just think about the popul ar slo-
gans "Got milk '!" and " What 
would you give for hea lthy, sh iny 
hair'!" 

The ad I would have particular-
ly I i ked to des ign is the Tombstone 
Pizza commercial. I am envious of 
the subtle mind that made philoso-
phy oul of grease and pepperoni , 

"What do you wan I on your 
tombstone'l" is the new-age trans-
lalion of ''To he or not to he." 

Indeed, once you huy milk as 
the result of a commercial or 
would give anything for a good 
hair day, you' re probably ready to 
contemplate the answer La the 
question posed hy Ihe pizza w m-
mercial. 

The medi a make all of us 
strange ly aware of how important 
it is to put forth and cult ivate a 
"good image." They deline this 
image for us via pictures of lu xury 
cars dri ven hy gorgeous women 
who wear Tina Earnshaw's latest 
romanlic makeup line, whi Ie out 
for a light dinner wilh a polile, 
godly male. 

Wilh a se lection of colors such 
as "Inde pendent ," "Rehe ll iuus" 
and "Hearthroken," Earnshaw 
made it difTicult for me to dec ide 
which color malches each of my 
t:lasse~ . I think I' ll wear 
"Passionatc" in Illy X a.lll . hiology 
t:lass. "Ex hilarated" in human i ti e~

weekends.

The ad I would have 
particularly liked to 
design Is the 
Tombstone Pizza 
commercial. I am 
envious of the

Nevertheless, it is safe to infer 

that many more people will see 
what you decide 10 put on your 
tombstone. This is nol simply a 
choice about pizza; it is now a ter-
rifying task that encompasses a 
philosoph ica l concept: eternity. I 
bow in front of thi s loft y idea, and 
overwhelmed as I am, would like 
to make a few suggestions regard-
ing the possih le epitaphs of people 
and institutions Ihat arc currently 
ncar, though not necessari Iy dear, 
to all of us. 

Oprah Winfrey: ' 'Thus, I made 
the ultimate connection, Hard

Peter Jennings: "And thai's Ihe 
way it all was." 

Pele Wilson: "I kicked an ille-
ga l oul to get thi s plol'" 

Andy Rooney: "Ever wonder 
why you die'!" 

Monica Lew insky: "Who's 
afraid of the hig, bad woW?" 

The Dalai Lama: ''The main 
problem wi lh the world is that you 
never know what sli ce you' re

Snow Wh ite: "Seven small

This whole experience left me 
wondering about UCSD's Parking 
and Transport ation Services . It 
made me curious as to where my 
$99 per quarter goes, and why there 
hasn't been a new parking lot built 
in the last four years while the 
undergradu ate popul ation conl in-

I wondered why student parking 
is so decentralized and wh y stu-
dents continue to put up with dri-
vi ng to school, parking as quickly 
as possible (if they can before their 
class starts), then hik ing all Ihe way 

a~ross ~ampu s to get there. 
I thoughl of the advert isements 

on shullies and in the school news-
paper that w mpliment the parking 
offi ce on the frequency of shult les. 
I wondered about the number of 
on-campus events made possible 
by taking away parking spaces thai 
students use on a weekly basis. 

Here arc some numbers you 
won' t sec in UCSD Parking and 
Transportation Services ads: 

Zero, that 's how many parking 
spaces I can rind on the entire south 
side of campus. 

50, that's how many min utes I 
was late to my meeting. 

None, that's how many students

Thunnan (guitar/vol:a ls) are famished al'ter a 
day on thc ru'td. It 's roughly !{ p.m., and the 
hand, which left Sl:oltsdale, Ariz. this morn-
ing, has already played a gig in Laguna Nigel. 

'This who le band just started out as fun 
- the four of us lout of li vcl arc long timc

music, llri nk, anll pl!oplc startell coming out 
to our shuws," Alan say~ bctween hites of

If thi s sou nds like a laid-back attitude, 
that 's hecause the hand memhers make every 
errort to ha ve a good time with their music, 
which is a tasty mixture of James Bond, 
futuristic surf and, of course, swing. Alien 
Fashion Show llidn ' t originate as a swi ng 
hanll - in fa~t they had no intention othcr 
th:tn having a good time. 

" It was really prclIy loose and it evulved

role of main spokesperson thi s evenin~. as 
the others scarf down their llinner.

Show had heen c)(perimenting with swing 
long before it became the rage. Swing's 
rapidly increasing popularity, the band agrees 
betwl!en mouthfuls, is ultimately a result of 
the fact thaI "it's just a hlast, a lot ofrun." 

Judging from AFW's fans , swing music is not 
Dnly fun but also appeab to a broad audience. 

"What wc' ve ~een in recent mont hs has 
heen IS-year-o lds up to 70-year-olds, which 
is pretty cool .. . everybody's just there to 
have a greattimc," Daetwciler said. 

A predominantly col lcge-age crowd attend-
ed the Oct. 3 AFS show at Porter's Pub and 
true to the hand's outlook on life and musil:, 'a 
greattimc' was hall by those who came. 

The night stancd at 8 p.m. wilh a swing 
dancc competition judged hy the members of 
Alien Fashion Show. Prizes ranged from AF 
T-shirts to tickets ror the upcomi ng Big Bad 
Voolloo Daddy c.:onecrt at RIMA . 

After the competition, the band took the 
stage for two short, but intense, 3S-l11lOutc 
sets. The band disphlyell tremendous energy, 
a characteristic inherent in their live perfor-
mances. All throughout the show, the horn 
players (who arc si tting in for th duration of 
the lOur), jumpell up anll llown and llunced 
outrageously on stage. 

During thc opening "Detroit Swing City," 
only a few hrave couplc~ ventun:d onto the

tion (j'f Esdler's work will be on display althe 
San Diego Museum of Art in Balboa Park 
through Jan. 3, 1999. 

M.e. Escher: A Centennial Tribule fea-
lures H4 works lhal span lhe lenglh of the 
artist's cateer. A Dutch architecl Imned prinl-
maker, Escher (18YH- 1 972) was inspired by 
his falher, a civi l engineer, 10 develop an 
inlerest in malh and science. 

His anistic lalent and malhemalical sk ill 
helpcd him 10 create the amazi ng images for 
which he is now famou s: compos ilions of 
complex inlcrlocking shapes thaI evoke jig-
saw pua les, perceplual gamcs in which Iwo-
dimensional ohjects appcar to be three-
dimen ional and architectural designs Ihal are 
physically impossihle (0 construt:t. 

MOSI of Escher's works were printed 
inslead of drawn, using various prinlmaking 
techniqucs such as woodcuts, lilhographs and 
mezzotinl s. 

Displayed are both his more ret:og ni zed 
prinls such as Drawing Hands, I Y48, and his 
Icsser known works such as Melamorphosis 
III, 1967-68. This piece is a 23-1'001 woodCUl 
of 33 blocks, used to prinl an image onto six 
sheets of paper Ihal Escher then colored by 
hand. The rcsult is a long, horizontal stream of 
consciousness that blends togcther geometric 
shapes lhal morph inlo hoals, fish, birds, Ili es, 
bees, a city, a chess board and bat:k into shapes. 

Circle Limit, 1959, demonstrales Escher's 
theory of "the regular divi sion of a plane." He 
puhlished a book with lhis litle in 1958 thai 

posed of four segmenls: 
Self Portraits, The World Observed, lnncr 
Visions and Metamorphosis. Self Portraits 
contains one of Escher's earliesl represcnta-
ti ons of himself as a young man. The World 
Observed di splays works from Escher's Slay 
in Ilaly, and Inner Vi sions feal ures Escher's 
visual experi menlS. Metamorphosis contains 
only Ihe co lossa l MClamorphosis Ill , along 
with examples thaI explain his development 
of the idea. 

Escher combined the polar worlds of arl 
and mathemalics within his work, which can 
be appreciated by co llege students for decora-
li ve reasons and by scienti sls for Iheo reti t:u l 
purposes. 

Because M.C Escher Iislcned to Bach as 
he created his intriguing works of art, the San 
Diego Museum of Art is also hosting u series 
of conce rt s centered on the famous composer. 
Pianisl David Korevaar will kickoff the Bach

Byrd credil s his diverse choreographic ~ly l e

vihranl style of modern dance hy comhi ning 
lhe lechnique and grace of hallci wilh jazz and 
African dance movcment s. He say~ his main 
inlention in JaaTrain is 10 go "beyond lhe pre-

barefoot does not hinder Ihe perfonners from 
execuling any movemenl , from incredible 
leaps to lriple pirouelles. 

JazzTrain is divided into dilTerent sessions 
of non-stop dancing and incredible artistry. 
The music of three separate artisls, Max 
Roach, Vernon Reid and Geri Allen help 
estahlish a differenl Ilair for each session. 

Jazz I, the lirst acl, drew lhe audience in a, 
the company walked on slage and proceeded 
wilh an a cappe lla dance sequence. A hush fell 
across the crowd and Ihe onl y audible sounds 
were the deep brealhs of lhe dancers and an 
occasional snapping of lingers. Music came 
in laler to supplemenl Ihe movement with a 
percuss i ve tone. 

The dancers wore simple black costumes, 
which drew more allention to the dancing. In 
conjunction with lhe slyle of music, the 
movemenls tended to be quick, energetic, 
rhYlhmic and graceful. The act concluded jusl 
as it began , with lhe a cappella dance 
sequence and a final linger snap.

mood than Ihe first. The string music , roman

The company danccrs were evcn l1Iore

agilily and slyle. Asidc from a slrong modern-
dance foundation, the performers also re ly on 
ballet c la~ses in New York Cily to prcparc

During the class. Byrd emphasized some 
of hi s dance values , including his belief thai 
"you should never think of dance as a noun, 
hut onl y as a verh." 

Dance, Byrd said, is all about acti on and 
movement, as we ll as Ihe relati ons hip 
hctween mind and movement.

ANTZ MAKE THEIR WAY FROM SINK TO THEATER 
This faits animation breakthrough gives our favorite bathroom critters a new name 
By Dan Lacey 
Guardian Reporter 

"Antz" promised to be a cool 
fi lm. The TV di ps showed it was 
made by Steven Spei lherg 's studio 
Drea ll1 work s, 
which is alway~ a 
sig n of quality, 
and the anima-
tion in the pre-
views looked 
exce llent. 

"Ant z" is evcn hetter than 
expected. The ani mation is good, 
the hest digi tal work seen to date, 
and the story is fa ir. Drea mworks 
has discovered what fans of Japan-
ese animation have known for a 
long time: The voiccs make a di f-
fe rence. 

Woody Allen plays the lead. a 
worker ant named Z who is di ssat-
islied with hi s lot in life . Allen, 
though not always successful in his 
previous films, did exce llenl work 
this time around. Sharon Stone is 
the voice of Princess Bala, an ant 
also less than enamored with what 
her future has to offer. 

The head villain is Bala's 
fiancee General Mandible. voice 

by Gene Hackman. Rounding ou t 
the othe r big names are Dan 
Aykroyd. Anne Baneron, Danny 
Glover, Jennirer Lopez, Sy lve ter 
Stallone and Christopher Walken. 

There are no 
compl ai nts In 
the acting 
~epartmen t. 

The plot is 
perhaps the 

weakest part of the fi lm, a ra irly 
standard " insignilican t peon over-
comes great odds and performs 
wondrous acts to win the lady of 
higher station" story. That havi ng 
been said, it is still not a had adap-
tation of that story. The college 
crowd i not necessarily the market 
the Ii 1m aims ror, but the ri 1m is 
qu ite ent ertai ning and the plot 
being light ma kes it a good movie 
ror a date. 

Without question, the movie's 
strong point is the computer ani -
mation. The company responsible 
for the visual magic is ca lled POI. 
One of the directors, Tim Johnson, 
was also the director on the Simp-
sons' 1995 Halloween special in 
which Homer was rendered in 3D. 

courtesy of OreamWorks Pictures 
Insect.: The unmistakable voice of Woody Allen, as wel l as the advanced technica l animation, bring 
these famous ants to (larger than) li fe. 
Johnson and his associates have 
put the intervening yea rs to good 
use. For you tech sorts, POI wrote 
their own sc ripting language and 

so ft ware to produce good fac ial 
ex press ions and rea list ic water 
effects. 

Even for peop le that are picky 

with their cinema, thi s is a good 
mov ie. "Antz" has an entertaining 
script and story, an all-star cast and 
a fantasti ca lly diffe rent selling.

room. She is a larger than life. tormen ted and 
a true everywoman . Even with three hand 

member~ Ilanking her, Manson radiated a 
glow that took command or the hackstage and 
carried over to the show. 

Indeed, it seems as if Man~on is the quin-
tessential rod star; she takes life as it comes. 
She sings abou t her philosophy in "When I 
Grow Up," the song that she used 10 close the 
show, and track three on Garbage 's newest

Manson talked to the crowd on Thur~day 
as if they were sitting on the couch ncxt to

And if only ror a while. we lived with the

-****, 
Listening 10 the latest alhum hy 

moe. is like listening to a fantastic 
battle hetween acoustic instruments, 
guitars, drums, horns and vocals. 
With a style that encompasses 
southern hluegrass, western music 
and rock, thi s band cre.lles a hlend 
that results in a creati ve and playful 
sound. The music is unique and 
smart - an hour of good fun. 

Most significant is the album 's 
ability to entrance the lis tener with 
awesome guitar ritTs filled with 
unexpected turns, such as in " paz 
Medicine." The first fi ve seconds 
of the song have a Dukes of Hazard 
air ahout them, bringing to mind a 
scene of our two fa vorite cousins 
being chased hy the sheriff. 

Listeners will sing "Hi and Lo" 
all day. It is a simple, catchy tune 
with Chuck Garvey's mesmerizing 
voice. However. the great instru-
mental jams during some songs 
seem to distract from the lyri cs and 
the smooth voices of Garvey, AI 
Schnier, Rob Dcrhak. 

Moe. recently performed in San 
Diego and at the Further Festival. 
This album would be enjoyed by 
Ph ish, Grateful Dead and Allman 
Brothers Band fans who appreciate 
a good jam.

Starfl yer 5<)'s new album, rhe 

Fashion FOCIIS, demonstra tes 
th eir great talent in maki ng 
music. Though it proba bly 
helongs in the all-encompassin g 
and horrifyingly broad category 
of alternati ve mu sic, the album 
di spl ays an intri guing musical 
style di fferent from today's alter-
nati ve groups. 

Most notably, the album has an 
almost mesmerizing aspect to it. 
Songs like "We're the Ordinary," 
have an unusual mi x of melodies 
and ideas. This song contains a 
mysteri ous and insidious theme, 
which makes the music so hypno-
tlZlllg. The repeating themes 
almost seem suhl iminal. Lead 
si nger Jason Marlin at times 
sounds like Tom Yorke. He has a 
calm voice that imparts a sadn.:ss 
to the music, such as in "Fell in 
Love at 22." 

Its hard to pinpoint the best 
aspect of this band 's style. Most 
prohabl y, as demonstrated in "All 
The Time," it would the design of 
the music. An acousti c guitar, hass 
guitar, stri ng ensemble, piano and 
drums accompany a beautiful voice 
and powerful electri c guitar. mak-
ing this a worthwhile album.

Blue Aeroplanes 
Spitting Out Miracles

*** 

There's nothing better th un a 
good band, good tunes and great 
song titles. which is exactly what 
Blue Aeropl anes' alhum, Spilling 
a li t Miracles, amounts 10. The 
hand could he appreciatcd by a soul 
who never left '80's rock. It has an 
air of familiari ty, reminisccnt of 
The Cure or the Smiths. No style 
can compare to the e '80's rock 
gods, hut Blue Aeroplanes suc-
ceeds in .:stahli shing a similar 
mood. 

The last track, " Do The Dead 
Know What Time It Is," best 
embodies thi s connection to the 
past. It is a collage of sounds and 
themes - an intense piece of 
music that ends in tranquillity. 

However, thi ' song also repre-
sents the limits of Gerard Langley's 
voice. When he sings melody, like 
in "Winter Sun," it is beaut iful. But 
just like '!lOs rock, his singing style 
is to speak the words. Thus, the 
album tends to get monotonous. 

Interestingly enough, the music 
downplays Langley's voice and 
instead emphasizes the arrange-
ment of instruments. The hest song 
on the album, "Teaching Engli sh 
Through Sex and Death," has a fas-
cinating mandolin start which con-
tinues throughout the song. 

If you are in the nlOod for a 
slightly different sound with fa mil-
iar ro t , then Spilling Out Mira-
cles would be an idea l candidate. 
Overa ll , the album is a creative and 
engagi ng musical experience.

-Brat/ SWnjield, Magic Love 
Foullfaill 

Glancing at the psychedelic 
cover of Magic Love Fountain's 
alhum Free, one would naturally 
assume that this band 's roots li e 
in the class ic rock of the '60s and 
'70s. 

In one sense, th is assumption 
is accurate. The Los Angeles-
hased tri o's laid -back, ' 60s coun-
terculture attitude is ev ident in 
their lyri cs . The group 's songs 
focus on a surpris ingly wide 
range of subjects, from love to the 
Internet, and the rel ati onship 
between open-mindedness and 
free love. 

However, Magic Love Foun-
tain d earl y draws on influences 
ot her than the classic rock icons 

of yesteryear - most notably, 
modern rock. They integrate all 
of these different styles into a 
cohesive whole. Des pite thi ' 
un ique comhinati on, the hrand of 
rock tends to be s li ghtly generic 
in a musical sense. 

The true soul of the album 
revo lves around the songwriting. 
Magic Love Fount ai n's I yric~ 
escape fro m th frequent ly dark, 
drugged-out , or nonsensica l 
world that oft en characterizes the 
genre of modern rock. Instead, 
they si ng of life, love and music. 

The best cut s on Free are the 
addictive "Who Do You Think 
You Are" and the lyrically bi zarre 
"Slow Motion Dream." Listeners 
will hear a fresh, upbeat and 
melodic collection of songs, but 
should not expect any spectacular 
jamming. 

While the band is loose ly 
co ined as a modern rock outfit , 
fans of straight forward rock ' n' 
roll , rather than their grunge-lov-
ing counterparts, will appreciate 
MLF's sound.

Alumnus to Head Tennis 
MOTIVATED: Former Triton, Eric Steidlmayer, fires up his new squad 
By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

This past summer. the U SD 
athletic department hired Triton 
alumnus Dan O· Brien to take 
over Triton haseball . 
O·Brien. formally the 
interim coach. led 
UCSD through such 
a great season and 
had such a strong 
rapport with his players 
last year that UC San Diego 
director of athletics Judy Sweet 
decided to keep O' Brien on as the 
official head coach this year. 

Last week. under simi lar cir-
cumstances. Sweet hired another 
UCSD alumnus to lead a di fferent 
Tri ton program to great success. 
This time it was former men's ten-
nis slar Eric Steidlmayer. fresh 
rrom a two-year stint as ass istant 
tennis coach at UC Davis. 

Valuable Player. he earned a berth 
10 the NCAA Div ision III 
National Championsh i p~ . 

Overall . the players are happy 
to have Steidlmayer back as head 

coach. Fifth-year seni or 
Ping Yeh. who played 

with Steid l mayer. 
was' espec ially 
pleased to have the 
alumnus back and 

leading the team. 
"Eric brings a lot of confi-

dence to the team. The guys are 
happy to have him here." Yeh 
said. " ISteidlmayer! is very moti-
vated. he is tired-up and he is very 
knowledgeable." 

Yeh al so commended 
Steid lmayer. who earned a mas-
ter's degree in economics from 
UC Davis. on his intelligence. 

" oOOdy is smarter than him. I 
don' t think there wi ll he any coach 
that wi ll out -think him th i~ year," 
Yeh ~ai d . 

team's first meeting lasted we ll 
over two hours. with Steidl maye r 
running down his lis t of goa ls fo r 
the men's t enn i~ program well 
into its planned move to Di vi~ lon 
II. 

" Eri~ wants us to be ve ry ~om ­
petiti ve in our region. and in live 
years, he wants us to be as domi -
nating in Di visiun II as the 
women's volleyball team is right 
now in Division 1/1." said Yeh. 
"He is very intense." 

Though the official season 
doesn't stan unti l the winter. a few 
members of Triton tennis. like 
Yeh, Steve Shabel. Dan Albrecht . 
Vi ncent Darmoju odo. Joe 
Zcrboni and Jason Hipp. will stan

Gustafson admired the Fijian 
sense of community. 

" In Fiji. a mother and fat her

Chin adm ired thei r si mple lire. 
"Thc Fijian people are so beau-

Soccer Struggles Mightily 
BAD TIMES: Monday's 3-2 10ss to Cal Lu dooms post-season hopes 
By Travis Hill 
Associate Sports Editor 

It 's new and it's not fun. 
As a mailer of fac t. the UCSD 

men's ~occer team's 3-2 lo~s at the 
hands of rival California Lutheran 
Universi ty las t Monday night at 
RIMAC Field was beyond 
"not fun ." It was 
absolutely horrible. 

Funice llo. For the fi rst time in 
quite a few matches, th t! Tri tons 
seemed to have that killer instinct. 

The huild up to the tir~t goa l 
was impressive. as the Tritons 
showed ~ome creati vity. Doug 

McBride took a ball down to 
the endline, turned and 

loft ed a nice cross to the 

As has been the ,.,, •• is 0 C C E R I 
case all season, the 

back post. where 
Funice llo was 
wailing to strike. 

Tri tons were close, but 
not close enough. They 
could have. would have. should 
have done so many things on so 
many tight plays, but in the end. it 
just wasn't enough. 

The loss wi II make the postsea-
son a tough destination for UCSD 
to reach. To make matters worse. 
hated Cal Lu did the damage. The 
ri va lry hetween these two schools 
has hecome an annual war. 

UCSD entered the game as 
underdogs. They would he with-
out two of their hest players, goal-
keeper Lucas Cunolo and cent ral 
midrielder Camero n Adams. 
Some thought th at injured forward 
Brady Bernard would al so be out . 
but he made hi s return to the team. 

The Tritons opened the game 
playing like a team that knew its 
back was against the wall. They 
were playi ng with intensilY to the 
poi nt of desperati on, and it 
worked. 

UCSD capitalized in the 10th 
minute and got a wonderful goal 
fro m the head or Anthony 

The Tri tons 
were fired up. It was 

huge for Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong's boys to get out in 
front earl y. 

Then the Tritons frustrated the 
entire crowd when they let down 
and allowed a goal in the very 
next minute. 

ThaI goa l stunned the Tritons, 
but they quickly regrou ped and 
hegan to work hard again. A fcw 
mi nutes later. Bernard made a 
gr.:at run on a counterattack and 
got a great through ha ll. He hroke 
away from the defensc. but was 
taken down from behind inside 
the I H. The referee awarded the 
Tritons a penalty kick. but inex-
plicably he did not give the Cal Lu 
defender a red card - he didn' t 
even give him a ye llow. 

Still . the Tritons could lake the 
lead on the penalty kick. Usually, 
Adams would take the kick -
Adams is fa ntas tic fro m the stri pe. 
He was in ~ trec t clothes, though, 
and lorwurd Scan Salinas took the 
kick - and missed it wide. 

Still , as the li rst half came tu a 
close, it looked like UCSD would 
havc ometh ing positive to take 
into the bre'lk. As has been their 
pai nfu l habit for the l a~ t few 
matches. though, UCS D broke 
down in the last few minutes of 
the lirst half and allowed a cheap 
Cal Lu goal. 

The Tritons would not give up. 
They just kept halliing. Especially 
Bernard , who was obviously SOIl!-
Iy missed in the last few games. 
He was working so hard for every 
ball and making such great runs 
that in the 51 5t minute. it paid off 
again as he got another break-
away. This tilllc there would be no 
penalt ies as he heat the goaltender 
on a marve lous chi p into the left 
corner of the net. The Tritons were 
lired up again . They had tied the 
match. 

The emotion was short-lived. 
however. as al Lu answered 
quickl y. Five minutes later, they 
got a free kick fro m about 30 
yards out. Charl ie Noble of the 
Kingsmen took the kick and sent 
an ama7 ing hall hending over the 
wa ll and dipping sharply just past 
the outstretched hands of Triton 
reserve keeper ei l SafTer. 

That was the hackhreaker. The 
Tri tons battled for the rest of the 
match, but the Kingsmen sat eight 
pl ayers. somet imcs nine back in 
their zone and shu t the door on 

CSD. Even though the Tritons 
had some very dose call~. it ju~t 
wasn't enough and they fe ll 3-2.

INT A IONAL "God's 
Land" ENDEAVORS 

By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

In Fij i, the buses come late, din -
ner isn' t served unlil after sunsel 
and if a joh doesn' l gel lin ished 
today, Ihere is always tomorrow. 

The locals on Viti Lcvu, the 
main island in the Fijian group, call 
Ihis "Fiji ti Ille." 

Revelle Senior Willis Chin and 
Marshall Senior David Gustafson 
got used to "Fij i time" Ihi s summer. 
They loved the spontaneil y and Ihe 
flexibilily of Ihe Fijian allitude that 
paid no alienI ion 10 regimented 
schedules. 

Chin and Gustafson spent most 
of August and part of September 
living on the dry side of ViIi Levu 
in a lillie vi llage called Tau. The 
purpose of their trip was to surf and 
to sel up a church in Ihe small fi sh-
ing communit y. 

After fund rai sing Ih roughoul 
the school year and sending money 
and suppli es 10 the small village, 
Chin and Gustafson took an 11 -
hour night over Ihe Pacific in mid-
August, and were greeled in their 
new village by Ihe Heritage family 
- thei r hOSI family in Tau. 

For the nex t four weeks, hin 
and Gustafson spcnllhei r mornings 
surling and their afternoons build -
ing. 

··W\.:' d get up al 6:30 in Ihe 
murnin g, Iil k\.: a live-minute hus 
ride 10 Sea~h e ll Covc, and then get 
on a boat thai would lake us out to 
Wilkes Reef," Chin said . "After 
surfing perfect rights for a few 
hours , Ihe hout wou ld take us hack 
to the ((lve al noon and thcn hy 
I: 15 lpm I wc wae working on Ihe 
church." 

everyone in the community pitched 
in and Ihat it was the church 111e111-
hers and Ihe other vill agers who did 
the majority of the work . 

''The Fijian people were hi ghl y 
skilled," Gustafson said . "( felt like 
I was always a slep behind them. I 
was probabl y Iwice as tall a~ them, 
hut they gOI Iwi ce as much done." 

Chin agreed. 
"We were just weak American 

donkeys." Chin admitted. "They 
were big, slrong and powerful." 

Chin said Iha1 hi s host falher, 
Jack Heril age, a Tau villager, also 
helped bui Id I he church. Chin 
described hi s host family as "well 
off" by Fijian standards. 

"We'd probably say Ihal Iheir 
house was a shack," Chin said . " It 
was a four-walled building wilh 
two rooms - a living room, and a 
kitchen and bathroom. Bul their 
house was ni t:e for Fiji ." 

Chin al so said that his host fam-
il y is accustomed 10 Western intlu-
ent:es and spoke English well. 

Second in a 
Three-Part Series 

Jack Herilage has a wife, 
Louisa, who works al a heallh t:e n-
ler. and a li ve-year-old daughler. 
Lorraine. 

AI the Herilage house, Ihe boys 
mosll y ate "Kasaba" for dinner. 
Kasaba, which is the Fijian equi va-
lenl 10 a pOlato, "tasted like nOlh-
ing," according 10 Chin. The kasa-
ba meal was al so accompanied by 
boiled fi sh Ihal was cooked 111 

coconut milk . 
Chin said that the coconul fish 

was good, but Gu ·tafson said that it 
tasled like cardboard . Incidentally, 
Gustafson lost 10 p()unds on the 
Irip and ended up sali ~ fy in g his 
appelite wilh a box of Powerhar ·. 

Halfway Ihrough the Irip, 
Gustafson and Chin took a break 
from Tau, and went to a 'mall 'urf 
resort ca ll ed Yanuthu. Chin 
described Ihe resort as being like 
Tavarua (a wel l-known surf resort 
in the Fijian chain) but more "Iow-
budgel." (It was about $25 a day, 
which induded four meals, lodging 
and transportation) .. 

AI Ihe resort, Ihey were greeted 
by Ihe chief and participated in Ihe 
lradilional "Cava" ceremony. Cava 
is a drink Ihat is made of crushed-
up cava rool and waler. The con-
cocti on is numbing 10 Ihe moulh 
and sli ghtl y intox icaling. crlin said 
Ihal Ihe drink was hard 10 swallow. 

" It looked ill, and lasled even 
more ill ," Chin said. "You are sup-

po,ed to clap once before drinking 
ii , and then clap three limes after 
you drink it. Then you pass it 
around. The cup is supposed 10 go 
around seven or eiglll times, but I 
only lasted Ihree rounds." 

Guslafson and hin also surfed 
al Yanuthu. It was aboUI an hour-
long boat ride oul to the mysto-reef 
break , called Friggcl's Pass. 
Located in the middle of the ocean, 
Frigget 's, Chin said, "was a gnarly 
IeI'I. The locals claim that it is as 
good as Cloudbreak ." 

Chin and Gustafson caughl 
Frigget's Pa~s at about double-over 
head. Chin only had a 6'8" with 
him, bUI he said that the ledgy 
drops were slill manageable. BOlh 
Guslafson and Chin made it 
Ihrough the trip with only minor 
reef cut s, bul Chin said Ihat he saw 
a surfer get chewed up by the shal-
low reef. 

After their Iwo-day excursi n al 
Yanulhu. the two Iraveled back 10 
the dry side of the island 10 contin-
ue working on Ihe foundation of 
Ihe church. 

Sept. 2 was a memorable day in 
Tau . For one, il was hin 's hirth-
day. Secondly, it was the hardesl 
working day of the Irip. 

After digging Irenches for six 
hours under the hOI Fijian sun, 
spared only by breaks for juice and 
hot lea , Gustafson and Chin laid 
down Iheir pick-axes and prepared 
for Chin's 2J51 hinhdny t:e /ehra-
ti on.

The Tritons 
had an 
outstanding 
weekend) 
going 3-0 tn 
the Slugfest 
Invitational 
at UC 
Santa Cruz 

By Travis Hili 
Associate Sports Editor 

Santa Cruz is a very strange and 
unu ."ual place. 

When dri ving through thi s 
quaint ocean town, it would not be 
out of the ordinary to he stopped by 
a very happy homeless guy with a 
vi kin" helmet on and a bottle of 
Southern Comfort in hi s back 
po<.:ket who just wanted to say 
hello in Japanese. It would also not 
he uncommon to run into a Banana 
Slug. whatever they are. Hey, "The 
Lost Boys" was fi lmed there, what 
do you expect'? 

So it shouldn ' t be at all surpris-
ing to find out that when U Santa 

ru z hosted its Men's Water Polo 
Slugfest In vitati onal Tournament 
las t weekend. th re was no win-
ner. 

But if the very politicall y t:or-
re<.: t Slugfest tournament would 
have <.: rowned a champion, U SD 
would have definitely heen the 
winner. The 'Tritons went 3-0 over 
the weekend in the round-robin 
format, defeat ing Da vis 17-8, 
Santa lara Uni versity 9-6 . nd

escaped the weekend wi thout a 
loss, thus making SO the und is-
puted "(;hampion" of the wel:kend. 

Whi le thi s tournarpent pro-
vided no hardware, it did 
prov ide UCS D 
and every other 
squad there 
so m e th i n g 
much m m: import ant at 
the midseason point : a sneak 
pre view into conferen<.:e play. 
UCSD will hattie with the likes of 
UCD, UCSC, Santa Clara and oth-
ers like Loyola Marymount 
Universit y, Redlands University 
and Claremont Co llege for the 
chance to play in the postseason. 

What did those other teams find 
out '? That the Tritons arc one of the 
best squads in the league. Head 
Coach Denny Harper has his boys 
playing great polo ri ght now, and it 
showed in the three games they 
had. 

The first matchup was on 
Saturday aga inst UCD. It was 
important that the Tritons corne out 
and make a statement ea rl y, 
because ri vals Santa lara, LM U 
and UCS had already posted 

impress ive victories, espec iall y 
Santa Clara, who had posted two 
wins by the time UCSD took the 

pool. 
Harper's troops indeed 

came out fir-
ing, as they 
recorded a 
spe<.: t ac ul a r 

six goa l performance. 
The defense also came up 

huge, as it shut the Aggies out in 
the first stanza. The Tritons contin-
ued the onslaught in the second 
quarter and fini shed the first half 
leading, 10-2. From there, the 
Tritons crui sed to a 17-8 win. 

UCSD looked very solid in their 
first game of the tournament and 
balan<.:ed in its atta(; k. Andrew 
Burkhalter, Ian Zakrzewski , Bryan 
Traverso and Gordon Beh ea<.:h tal-
lied three goa ls. Also contributing 
were Vladimir Djapic, Ryan 
Dandy, Michae l Plough, Paul 
Motachall and Paul Blessman, 
each with a goa l apiece. 

The second game of the Tritons' 
journey was the opening game on 
Sunday. or course, it was against 
the Broncos or Santa lara. The 

Bron<.:os were 2-0 on the weekend 
and would most likely run the tah le 
i I' they could get the win. 

The Bro n<.:os were playi ng 
tough, but they had nu idea what 
was waiting ror them in the water. 
Junior All-American Ross Mecham 
was shut out in the UCD game. 
Apparentl y, that upset hi m. 
Apparently that upset him enough 
to go out and s<.:ore seven of 
UCSD's nine goals on the match. 

"Ross blew up that game." 
Traverso said. 

Santa Clara put a scare into the 
Triton ' in a d ose match, but goals 
by Dandy and Doug Cole put them 
over the top. 

UCSD rode the momentum of 
that win into the UCSC game and 
although it allowed 12 goals, the 
Tritons tallied 19. Mecham only 
had three goals, but Cole had a 
huge day with six s<.:On:s. 

The Tritons carne horne from 
their "trip" to Santa Cruz with a 
new perspecti ve on their <.:onfe r-
ence play. AlLhough the Air Force 
Academy still looms large, Harper 
and the boys have to feel good 
about the se<.:Ond half of the sea~on . 

Don't get me wrong, I defi -
nitely informed them of j ust how 
wonhless they all were, and' ~ 
also took the liberty of telling 
them to shut the hell up. I was 
almost drowned out . though. hy

TAPPED: Tritons tame terrible Tigers and turn to tremendou matchup with Cal Lu this Sunday 
By Jacob Gordon 
Sports Editor 

ome games are a war. Trudging 
through the trenches, the playing 
11eld hecomes a hattlefield. It is a 
challenge, hoth mentally and physi-
cally. Fighting for every possihle 
advantage, every player stretches 
themselves to the limit. The game is 
always in question. up for gmbs 
until the last possible second. 

On the other hand, 'ometimes 
ou so totally humiliate an oppo-

nent that you ean put your ~oali at 
forward . 

That is exactly what happened 
las t Monday in Los 
Angeles when the 0 
women's soccer team 
destroyed Occidental 
College 10-0. 

The score was 
9-0 when oach 
Brian McManus 
pulled goalkeeper Jennifer 
Hetland and put her at forward. 
It was clear that all the time in front 
of the net didn ' t take away from her 
skill in the field as sh capped olf 
the win with a goal of her own. 

Tru th be told, the Tritons had 
expected a harder game than they 

got. 
"I almost feel ashamed 

or beating them that 
badly," sophomore 

hri sty Abizaid 
said. "We thought 

they were going to 
give us a game, but they 

had some problems." 
Occidental's main problem was 

that its tarting goalkeeper blew out 
her A L before the game. With no 
backup goalkeeper, the Tigers had 

to use a field player in goal. The 
lac k or experience in the six-box 
increased the Triton's scoring 
opportunities. 

The scoring was spread evenly 
through out the team, however. Of 
UCSD's 10 goa ls, n one Triton 
cored more than two, with rresh-

man forward Jennifer Cordova net-
ting a pair. 

The win may have been a big 
confidence hooster, but the Tritons 
might have liked more of a chal-
lenge as they prepare to play rival
