On gasoline gl u ts and 
the new state taxes 

A funny thing has been happening lately - funny 
for motorists, not so funny for the oi l conglomerates. 
Gasoline prices have shot past the $1 per gallon mark 
- this time heading downward - and have hit prices 
as low as 92.9 cents per gallon for regular and 96.9 
cents for unleaded here in San Diego County. 

T o whom are drivers indebted? To themselves, to 
be s ure . By purchasi ng more fuel ·efficient 
automobiles and by driving fewer miles, Americans 
have decreased the demand for gasol ine. Al 0, drivers 
should be indebted to a worldwide oil "glut" which 
has forced OPEC na tions to reduce the price of crude 
oil, reducing it by $5.50 per barrel. 

Motorists should be grateful to themselves and to 
the oil surplus for the decrease in prices. Motorists 
should definitely not be grateful to the oil companies. 

These multinational giants are not as sweet as they 
seem, and they don't seem all that sweet in the first 
place. They are getting every penny they can possibly 
squeeze out of the consumer , plus one or two more. 
This can easi ly be seen by examining the recent price 
fluctuations of both gasoline and diesel fuel, and by 
acknowledging the factors involved. 

Of special interest is what has happened in 
California with the state gasoline tax approved by 
voters in November. As oUan. I, a twocent per gallon 
surcharge has been added to the cost of the fuel. 
Coincidentally, most major oil companies lowered 
their wholesale prices by - look at that - exactly two 
cents - just enough to compensate for January's tax 
hike. The oil giants absorbed the two cent loss. and 
Californians are beginning to get needed 
improvements for the roads they travel. Exxon, 
Mobil , Shell , Chevron, et al. didn't absorb this loss out 
of the goodnes. of their hearts; they absorbed it 
because the price was already the highest the market 
would bear. 

:--Iow as the federal five cent gasoline tax 
approaches, we see gas prices steadily decreasing. 
Just hefore the tax goes into effect on April 1 , expect to 

~ee :-,ome or all of the five cent increase to be absorbed 
as losses to the multinationa l petroleum corporations, 
th us resulting in little price change for the consumer. 

On the other hand, look what has happened 'with 
diesel prices. A fe\\. years ago, before the tremendou s 
rise in popu larity of diesel automobiles, this fuel cost

Letters to the Editor 

In search of nostalgia food 
Au open leiter to the students 
alld faculty at UCSD. 

The writer Calvin Trillin 
ha s described a popu lar 
affliction ca lled "Hometown 
Food Nos talgia " which results 
in million s of pounds of 
sausage. cheese, cand y and 
ot her goodies c risscross ing the 
country every year in sea rch of 
desperate ex patriates. The 
theory was developed by a 
fri end of Trillin's as hI' s tood 
in the post office line, holding a 
package of K a n sas City's 
famed Wolferman's Engl ish 
muffllls that hc was about to 
.,end to his son 111 Virgll1ia_ 

We are two \\.illlllg \lctnTIS 
of lIolllctown Food Nostalgia 
and co nfess to lifetime 
allegiances to such special 
American foods a<, the creamy 
carame ls made by the nuns of 
Our Lady of th e Mississi ppi 
Abbey in Dubuque, Iowa; the 
thick potalochips fried in pure 

lard from Dieffenbach 's in 
Womelsdorf, Pa. and the puffy 
Common Crackers from the 
Vermont Country Store in 
Rockingham, Vt. 

We think others wou ld like 
to know about America's time-
honored foods made a t firm s 
where quality ha s nev er 
wav ered, so we are compiling 
examples of America' s best· 
loved food s for a book to be 
puhlished in 1984 by a major 
puhli shi ng hou se. However, 
we nced your hrlp to make 

s ure your s tate is well 
represented. Please le t u s 
know about any food products 
from yo ur hometown or 
elsewhere that you consider 
absolutely firs t·rate. We' re not 
looking for alcoholic beverages 
or a house s pecialty from a 
restaurant (u nless it also is 
avai lable in stores or bv m ail · 
order), but soups, cak-es, ice 
creams, snacks, canned food s. 
mea ts, cand y, etc. tha t are 
truly onc·of.;\·k ind .

Editor: 

Fond as r am of Britain, and 
as much as J hate to crit icize 
t hat cou ntry on t he eve of 
Queen Elizabeth's visit, I feel 
forced to respond to Peter 
Hopkinson's defen!'.e of Briti"h 
food (Feb. 14). !'v1r. Hopkin"on 
s tat es t h at t ho'>e who 
disparage Brit Ish cooki ng 
"have ob\'iou!'.l} never been 
treated to the glories o f a well 
prepared roa s t beef and 
Yorkshire puddlllg, a bread 
and butter pudding, a trifle, a 
Devonshire cream tea , or a 
cornish pastie. " 

J have sampled all these 
di shes. It' s true that when 
well ·prepared they are all 
good, and some are very good 
indeed. But Mr. Hopkinson's 
conclUSIOn, "The cooking of 
Britain surpas,>es that of any 

other natIOn for full flavor," is 
Simply a bs urd . The only 

re~pect In which Briti s h 
cu i;' lne ;, urp~sses that of any 
ot her natIOn is in a propens ity 
to overcooked vege tables _ 
Britain ha~ a large number of 
very g<xx.l restaurant s, but 
most of these are run by 
immigrants from Europe, 
As ia, Africa or the Caribbean , 
or by Britons who learned to 
cook abroad. 

Even a s ide from the fact 
that "American" food has 
become extremely popu lar in 
Britain , Mr. Hopkinson'sgibes 
about American cooking are 
out of place. Hot dogs and grits 
may be delicious or awful, 
depending on the qua lity of 
preparation . As for MeDon · 
a ld \, Mr. Hopkinson must be 
a wa re that the Original fil~t 
f(xxi hamburger \.\a '> British. I t 

is st ill avai lable at establis h· 
ment s known as Whimpy 
Bars , and makes a Big Mac 
ta s te like prime rib in 
comparison. 

Perhaps Mr. Hopkinson 's 
letter is an exam !Jleof the pos t· 
F(llklands assertiveness thal 
Mrs. Thatcher hopes will 
revitali7e Britain . Certainly 
the Britis h have muc h of 
which they ca n be proud , in 
the present as wel l as the past. 
For example, neither good 
newpapers nor good manners 
are yet extinct in the Briti sh 
Isles. Ye t no one wou ld claim 
world bealer stat us for 
Britain 's indust rial relation s, 
Briti s h Rail, t he Briti s h 
climate, or Prince Andrew s [Q. 
Loya l Rriton s and Anglophiles

Aggie didn 't know what to 
say. So she didn't say 
anyth ing. Later, she cried. 
Later, like a lot of people, s he 
asked why it happened. 

The cops who know the area 
rarely bother to ask that 
anymore. 

"You don't have to have a 
reason," Patrolman Jim 
Murphy told me. "These are 
gang·bangers. They s h oot

people because they like to."

"I was going through a

" He'd 'iay to me: 'Don ' t worry, 
Jim , it 's gonna work out ok, 
you 'll see.' " 

Murphy and Ralph had 
lunch everyday just before 
Ralph went on duty. They got 
a long real well. 

"On the days that 1 get

they dOll't take to st rangers ,

At Sicilia's, you can have

On a small pile of missives 
typed hard with angry words 

By JAM ES RALPH PAPP 
Staff Writ er 

[ was going to begi n thiS 
editorial by saying that the 
Sun God had brought down 
upon us a rain of letters, but 
that is too utterly bad a pun. 
However, t he lette r from Scot 
Rhoads in the Thur'iday, 
February 3rd ech tlOn precipl' 
tated (there I go again ) a :-mall 
pile of mlsive!'. typed hard 
\\ ith angry hand., None uf 
these letter \.\nters has liked 
the Sun God and I disagree 
with all of them. I not on ly like 
the Sun God but think it is 
good. Niki de St. Pha lle had a 
glorious in-tention and carned 
it out well. 

ReplYing to each letter in 
order, Scot Rhoads gets to be 
first. He starts his piece with 
the word s, "My God!" but on 
reading further one find s that 
he does not object to the Sun 
God on religious grounds. 
Indeed it is difficult to find 
exactly why he objec ts to It. 
Buried in his allusl\e high 
rhetoric, the closest reference 
to a bas is for his displeasure is 
the term 'tragicomic cocka· 
trice,' which st ill does not 
make matters perfect Iy clear. 
He also, In a feti s histic pur uit 
of alliteration, refers to the 
scu lpture as a 'brobding· 
nagian bogy.' That, Chem 
students, mean s that he 
thinks it is too big. It is forthi 
exasperating elusiveness that 
I have, on two occasions, tried 
to strangle Scot Rhoads, both 
times uns uccessfully becau e 
of his habit of always wearing 
a heavy s hirt and two coats,

Comments on the Sun God Gas taxes 
ruin profits continued (rom page 3 different way of raising his 

hat. The writers of those 
letters may not like color and 
excitement, their favorite 
color may be grey and their 
favorite size small, but I 
cannot imagine missing the 
fun of walking by the Sun God 
every day. 

The writers also pale like 
elderly gentlewomen at what 
they think is a breach of good 
ta te on the campus. As I 
looked with a friend at the Sun 
God a few days ago, I pointed 
out that one can hardly breach 
the good taste of the Muir 
parking lot, to which he replied 
that Harvard would put 
something grand and inspiring 
next to a parking lot, and I said 
that Harvard puts parking lots 
next to grand and inspiring 
things, which is not the same 
at all, and ra ther worse. If I do 
ay so my elf (and 1 do), mine 

was the victorious side of the 
exchange. 

Giving the sc ulptur e 
nickname is the least 
constructive course of all.After 
looking at the Sun God r 
bumped into my art profes or 
and asked if he had seen it. He 

called it the psychedelic 
penguin , which was reductive, 
and 1 told him so (toadying is 
not my whole life). Even worse 
is simply 'the bird: which is a 
greater evil than the one it 
thinks it is making fun of, for it 
lacks any imagination or even 
thought. Scot Rhoads' This 
thitlg' is better even than that, 
or the giantpurplevolleyball· 
net. That reminds me of the 
urprisingly unfair practice of 

judging 'the net' before it is 
hardly begun . How many of us 
would be unconcerned if our 
profe sors barged into our 
rooms and took our essays 
away to grade before (he 
things were half finished? 

Finally there is money, and 
the shock of people on 
discovering that art has to be 
bought, which is not lessened 
by the fact that the money, 
through no st retch of the 
imagination, comes from their 
pockets, nor would probably 
ever have found its way there 
as a scholarship or anything 
else. Whet her money should be 
spent on art or on scholarships 
is as silly a qlle tion as 
whether the stuff should go for 
scholarship or front yard

People spend their money 01)

enjoy the work of Niki de St.

outside the ranks of Op and

the ranks of engineers and

enormous amounts of alcohol 
in his room becau e someone 
has given him far morethan he 
need for college, leaves many 
unthrilled. 

Those people who do not like 
the Sun God because it is big, 
or has color, or is not cement, 
will, I have no doubt, be 
unswayed by this article. 
Those who think that other 
people ought to spend money 
not on what those 0 1 her people 
want, but on what those 
without the money want, will 
not give this editorial a second 
thought. Nickname coiners 
and protectors of the public 
taste will be unmoved. But I do 
hope than anyone who hasn't 
thought of enjoying the Sun 
God , enjoyi ng it as 'art' or 
anything else, might try doing 
that, if only to escape from this 
uperfatted piece of prose.

con iderably le ss than 
gasoline did . That made sense; 
diesel fuel costs less - much 
less - to produce, s ince far 
less refining is needed to 
produce it than is required for 
both leaded and unleaded gas. 
But today diesel runs 15 to 20 
cents per gallon more than 
ga oline, simply because it' 
less available and oil 
companies can get away with 
charging more. Thi becomes 
clear when looking south of 
the border, where diesel costs 
less than half of what gasoline 
cos t s. Oil compa ni es in 
America are charging $1.20 
and more for it there, becal~se 
they can get it. It's as sim ple as 
that. 

The imposition of gas taxes 
may ruin the oil corporations' 
string of Qu arterly reports of 
record-breaking profits. What 
a shame. And all those who

Jud y Sweet submitted the

If th ings go as it appears 
they will. Sweet will be 
presented with a total of 
$144,000 to divide among the 
22 head coaches next year. The 
question is: How will s he slice 
the pie? CO~1nentary------------------------------------

Sweet has al ready estab-
li s hed that s he will not divide 
it equally among the 22 
coaches. Although no figures 
were quoted, the salaries will 
probably fluctuate from $3,000 
to $10,000. some coaches work 
quite a few hours a week more 
than others during i he season, 
and that will be a factor in 
determining individual 
salaries, as will the length of 
the season . 

Another factor which merits 
consideration , according to 
Sweet , is "added contribution 
to the program." By si ngling 
ou t a handful of coaches, 
Sweet explained what the 
term "added contributions" 
mean s. "Volleyball Coach

UCSD: Serious about sports? 
By MIKE GREENBERG 

SlUff Writer 
February 18th is a date that 

will go down in the annal s of 
UCSD hi story. A TGIF was 
held , A Jll/ie Hall was played at 
Mandeville Audi torium , and 
the Intercollegiate Athletic 
Progra m received $\06,000 in 
an effort to upgrade their 
disasterous coaching sa lary 
s ituatio n . Although so me 
might disagree, lhe mos t 
signifi cant development of the 
three concerns [ntercollcgiate 
Athletics. Simply because it 
affects the most people() know 
there are a 101 of Woody Allen 
fans out there), but it's true. 
The salary increases (w hich 
by the way are not fin ... 1 until 
the last week of April) , will 
have a twofold effect on the 
coaches. One, they now will be 
able to pursue a career a t 
UCSD knowing they are on 
more solid financial ground 
and, tv, 0 , t here wi II not be as 
much int 'rnalgripinggoingon 
among them. 

But what will happen to the 
l.A. department now that it 
has apparenLl y won 11 s long 
hard battle with the Reg Fee 
Committee? Will the program 
flouri s h no\\ that the coaches 
will be less likel y to cause a 
mutiny? What does the future 
hold for Athlet ic Dir ctor Judy 
Sweet and the department 
itself? Whatever may occur in 
the not ·so·dis tant fut ure 
remains to be seen, but one 
thing's for certain: Intercolle-
giate Athletics is in much 
better s hape t han it was before 
the c ruci a l deci s ion was 
handed down to them la. t 
Friday. 

What the LA. department 
must protect agains t is 
complacency among all parties 
tnvolved . A likely mi~con ep-
tion of the cOCllhes' salaries 
di lem ma wou ld be the 
altitude. for example; "Great. 
the coaches' salaries got the 
money they deserved." When 
looking in from the outside, it 
is easy to see how someone 

could come up wnh that 
assessme nt. Afte r much 
publicity, the coaches fi nally 
got the ral~e they \\ ere seek1,:g 
and one of th e reasons for I h1s 
was s tudent concern Bu t 
under closer ..;crut in\, one 
would find that an average 

~alary of $6,500 up from an 
aggregate $1.900 is st111 \ el') 
minimal in relative lerms . 

After all. trying to ma ke a 
living in this fashion would be 
hard enough for 11 college 
student , let alone a collegiate 
head coach. , weet must mnke 
sure that the salan issue 
doesn't die because, en' n with 
the increase, coaches are still 
vastly underpaid . But weet. 
who has been the school 's 
Athletic Director for the past 
eight years , real1 7es the 
problem of c()mplacency . 
"Complacency (IS) certainl~ 
somethtng to be measured and 
I will make e\ery attempt to 
prt'vent 1t if it does arts ."

Isra~l and the Middle East; conflicts 
continued from paj:!c 1 
has attempted to budd a 
coalition, or "fi"t" a. Rothm;1n 
caIls it, bet ween five pro-
Western Mid-East cou ntrics: 
Israel. jordan , Saudi Arabia, 
Egypt, and the Sudan. This 
" fist" would basica ll y 00 used 
to challenge the threat of 
Soviet aggression , as well as 
Islamic fundamentali s t 
expa nsionism. In the past 
week, this "f ist" was 
successful in preventing an 
attempt by Libya to overthrow 
the government of Sudan. 

Secondl y, with the ascen-
sion to power of Ayatollah 
Khomeini in Iran , the US 10 t 
acce to Iranian oil. 
Therefore. US reliance on 
Saudi oi l became essential. 
and the US committed itself to 
maintaining the Saudi family 
in power due to this reliance. 
As Rothman tated , "If 
tomorrow, on the Arabian 
peninsula, there were a 
revolution, the Saudi family 
would cease to be the factor. 
that the name of the Arabian 
peninsula would probably be 
the Democratic People's 
Republic of Arabia, or the 
Is lamic Republic of Arabia." 

The third, and most 
important, reason for US 
involvement in the Mid-East is 
its commitment to Israel. This 
commitme nt, Rothman 
believes, is based on many 
dimensions. They include: 
American military acces to 
the Israeli port city of Haifa 
and the US built airbases in 

the Negev desert: the fact that 
Israel is the onlv <!emocr;1cy in 
the region (and therefore the 
most stable): and the notion 
that the US can aVOId a direct 
confrontation with the Soviets 
by using Israeli forces as 
surrogate~ (as happened in 
1969-70) when Israeli planes 
shot down s ix Soviet -piloted 
Egyptian planes)_ Yet the most 
important facet of the US 
commitment to Israel is the 
moral commitment. According 
to Rothman , "More than 90 
percent of the American people 
believe that America has a 
commitment to Israel's 
survival." 

Conversely, and in compar-
ison with the US, the USSR's 
interest in the region is less 
complex . The main interest, 
Rothman stated, is the Soviet 
desire to gain access to warm-
water ports. The USSR has 
only one open warm·water 
port: Vladivostok. In order to 
accomodate the huge Russian 
fleet, the Soviets have 
established close ties with 
Libya, yria, Iraq, and South 
Yemen. 

Rothman believes this first 
level of conflict. between the 
US and the USSR is, in 
realistic terms, irreconcilable. 
Rothman told the audience 
that if the US and Soviet 
Union ceased in playing the 
pivotal role as superpowers, 
new superpowers would rise 
to take their place, and 
inevitably lay claim to the 
Middle Ea~l in terms of 

··national INerc"t " 
The Second Conflict 

The second level of conflict 
Rothman discu;,sed was that 
bet ween Israel and the Arah 
s tates which border her. 

"When I first spoke at 
UCSD in the late 19605, if you 
would have suggested to me 
that t here would have been a 
formal peace treaty between 
Israel and its largest Arab 
neighbor, I would have told 
you you were crazy," Rothman 
said in reference to the Camp 
David accords. As a re~ult of 
Camp David, Israel and Egypt 
established diplomatic 
relations , cultural exchanges, 
and, Israel returned the 
occupied territory of the Sinai 
back to Egypt. Rothman 
jokingly told the audience 
"You can -take a bus from 
Jerusalem to Cairo, and you 
can come back, and vice 
versa. 

UCSD athletics 

The one question that 
troubles Rothman and other 
Middle East analysts: did 
Israel sign a peace treaty with 
Egypt or with Anwar Sadat? 
That is, since the a<;sassin· 
ation of Anwar Sadat, has 
Egypt had second thoughts 
about Camp David? Rothman 
admitted that no one actually 
knows. Sadat' s successor, 
Hosni Mubarek, is acting 10 a 
"pragmatic way" Rot hman 
stated. Mubarek's two main 
policy objectives are t o 
reintegrate Egypt back into 
the leadership of the Arab 
v"orld, while simultaneouslv 
maintaining peace with Israei. 
Mubarek will not jeopardize 
losing the Sinai once more to 
the I raelis. But as Rothman 
pointed out, "Who knows 
what will happen aftcr 
Mubarek." 

continued from page 5 
One a~p\:"ct that has plagued 

the LA. dept is lack of ·t udent 
support at paid admission 
contests. The I.A. department 
IS partially to blame for this 
due to lack of publicity. The 
athletic department simply 
does not promote their events 
(unle s one counts a banner 
across the front of t he gym the 
day before the events take 
place) and the end effect is 
students being uniformcd 
about upcomming ballgames. 
Judy Sweet desperately needs 
a full -time staff person to take 
charge of publicity and 
promotion (a full -time Sports 

Information Director would 
also help) to correct this 
adverse situat ion. 

UCSD sports get less media 
coverage than La Jolla High 

chool and Sweet recognizes 
the need for a full-time 
employee. In the past few 
weeks, both the athletic 
department and the Reg Fee 
Committee has emphasized a 
need for a public relation, 
director. It would be the 
responsibility of the adminis-
tration to provide funding for 
such a position. At the present 
time, some prominant names 
are being mentioned for thejob 
if it arises. 

In relation to Mubarek , 
jordan's KlIlg Hussein is al"o 
being " pragmatic .. · Hus~etn·~ 
main concern is to keep hIS 
throne; and to keep from losing 
it, he must avoid conducting 
direct negotiations with the 
Is raelis . History has been a 
con:-;tant reminder to I [ussein 
of what happens to Arab 
leaders who propose peace 
with Israel. In 1951, Hus~ein 
was a witness, and almost a 
victim himself. when his 
grandfather Kiog Abdullah 
was as. a . inated in Jerus·

Students and administrators take a gander at a darkened quad east of Muir Cafeteria. The 
major problems that planners have encountered in allowing for campus safety has been 
balancing aesthetics with the pragmatic approach, i.e. minimizing vegetation. Costs, too, can 
be prohibitive, with taller lamps running as high as $20,000. 

Behind Urey Hall there was 
a concern that there were no 
lights by the parking spaces. 
Powers noted that there were 
only 5 B permit staff spaces 
there, and it would be a 
cheaper olution to take out 
the parking entirely. 

Behind the GuardianlChe 
Cafe parking lot, there are 
many overgrown bushes . 
UCSD Police argeant Bill 
Mott aid because there are 
parking meters, it is a 
de ignated parking area. Thi 
area seemed treacherou , 
although correcting the 
problem would be costly, as 
lights run in the area of about 
$2000 a piece for the 20-
footers . 

Surveying the area by the 
Revelle Deli and Cafeteria, 
after closing, there are no 
Itghts and everything look 
prell y dis mal. Powers 
announced: "Ah, now we've

When they reached theAPM 
quad, it wa completely dark. 
Weltzien said on la t year' 
walk, the group had talked 
about installing flood lights on 
the wall. Even the light on the 
ground and in planters need to 
be put back into operation. 

Walking throughout Third

remarked, "if you took out 
every other (alternate) fixture, 
you'd still have adequate

seem to have the most 
inadequate lighting). Unfor-
tunately, most of the campus 
is not as well lit as Third

On the path from TLH to 

Central Library, students had 
earlier suggested a call box be 
installed. As the group pa sed 
thi area, a call box was indeed. 
installed there, but whether it 
is new or ha always been 
therenoone eemedtoknowat 
the time. Powers noted that, 
"It' illegal technically to have 
thi . call box installed so high 
that it's out of reach for the 
handicapped." Happily, when 
two of the call boxe were 
opened to see if they were, 
working, the police responded 
instantly. 

gt. Mott ended the walk by 
'aying: "I appreciate you guys 
telling u about problems; if 
we don't look out for one 
another as a community, 
there's no hope." 

Gragg stated at the finale of 
the walk, "We're going to call 
people and check upon it."

UCSD production • s 
smctly for the 'Birds' 

Aristophanes' comedy The 
Birds will be presented by UCSD 
drama students nightly at 8 pm 
on friday. March 4 through 
Sunday. March 6 in Mandeville. 

This production is the 
premiere of an adaptation of the 
classic play by Michael Addison. 
provost of Warren College and 
drama professor. 

The Birds. one of the greatest 
of comic fantasies, was first 
performed in Greece about 414 
BC. It follows the adventures of 
two war-weary Athenians who 
convince the local bird 
population to help them build a 
utopia, dubbed "Cloud-Cuckoo-
Land." a strategy designed to 
make the two men lords of both 
heaven and earth. 

Addison will direct The Birds. 
Graduate student Peter Ward 
has written an original musical 
score for the production, and 
undergraduate Roger Costello 
has designed the costumes, "a 
bizarre amalgamation of 
contemporary and ancient 
clothing. from clown costumes 
to punk rock outfits. plus more 
feathers than have ever been In 
one place at one time." 
according to Addison. 

The cast includes Liza Bobo. 
Carol Mellen. Wendy Wilson, 
Maria Porter. Chrysanne Lowe. 

Jeff Klein. Scott Haven and 
Bryant Bradshaw. 

After its UCSD appearance. 
the cast will perform at UC 
Irvine and then will travel to 
England. There it will perform 
The Birds at the University of 
Exeter, the Stephen Joseph 
Theatre in Scarborough (Alan 
Ayckboum, artistic director) 
and at the fine Arts Center in 
York. In exchange. drama 
students from North Riding 
College will perform at UCSD 
next year. 

The production is funded by 
an Instructional Improvement 
Grant from the University of 
Cal ifornia. which is given for the 
purpose of enhancing 
undergrad ua te ed uca tion. 
Addison explained that this 
production will provide an 
intensive theater experience for 
the student cast members. 
giving them first-ha nd 
knowledge of theater touring 
and all aspects of the theater 
arts. There is no crew for the 
production. so the cast must 
manage its own lights, props 
and costumes from one English 
stage to the next. 

Tickets for The Birds are $3. 
and they will be available only 
at the door at Mandeville on 
nights of the performance. 

The Royal Uchtenstein, Quarter Ring, Sidewalk Circus will 
perform in Revelle Plaza at noon on Wednesday. for the past eleven 
years the Royal Uchtenstein Circus has toured the U.S. with a 
lighbting-paced potpourri of acrobatics, comedy. magic. unicycling. 
juggling and animal ads. as well as a mime show. The cast includes 
veteran gymnast. Jens Larson, unicyclist. Dan Trainor. and dance-
mime [ric Wilcox. The Ringmaster is Nick Weber. who founded the 
circus. The menagerie includes Dan Rice, the world's smallest 
performing circus stallion. The presentation is free of charge and is 
sponsored by the Office of Religious Mfairs.

'Werewolf 
and 'Thingsl 

By ClYD[ N[ N[E 
Last year when Rick Baker 

won the Academy Award for the 
makeup etfe(ts in American 
Werewolf in London. one of the 
few names that he reeled off in 
his acceptance speech was that 
of special effects makeup art ist 
Bill Sturgeon. ( he image of the 
typical makeup art ist doesn·t 
seem to fit Bill Sturgeon; he is a 
very down to earth type of 
person, tall. good looking. and 
at age 21 has an impressi ve list 
of films to his credit. This lineup 
includes The Nowling. The 
Thing. and most recently the 
controversial film Videodrome. 

Sturqeon started his career at 
16 when a friend got him a job 
building props for the Jim 
Danforth film Tim ega te. Whlle 
working on this film he became 
friends with special effects 
makeup art ist Doug BesWick. 
After work had been done on the 
preliminary props for the film 
the proj ect was cancelled. 

After this Sturgeon. through 
the help of Beswick. was able to 
secure a position on The 
Nowlin!!. 

Zany, exuberant, musical 'Boyfriend' for La Jolla 

BeswICk introduced Sturgeon 
to Rick Baker after The Nowling 
was completed. At the time 
Baker was beginni ng \'work on 
two projects and hired Sturgeon 
to assist him \'with them. These 
films were Night SkieS, the 
Steven Spielberg film that Cdme 
before E. To, and An American 
Werewolt 

By JOAN fORSBERG 
A taste of pink cotton candy. 

The Boy friend, a musical spoof 
of the zany 1920s, is currently 
being presented by the La Jolla 
Stage Company at the Parker 
Community Auditorium in La 
Jolla. 

Written and composed by 
Sandy Wilson. The Hoy friend 
contains all the razzle-dazzle of 
the 1920 musical comedies: 
blitheful plot, tuneful melodies. 
and exuberant youth who burst 
into song and dance at a whim. 

The scene is Madame 
Dubonnet's finishing School for 
proper young English ladies on 

the romantic Riviera. It is love 
at first sight when the wide-eyed 
ingenue Polly Browne spies the 
earnest messenger boy Tony 
Brockhurst. The young lovers 
are caught in a whirlwind of 
romance. 

Neanwh Ie, the flirtatious 
flappers of th e school 
passionately pursue their 
dashing beaus on the sunny 
beach and at the elegant 
masquerade ball. Love abounds. 
Even the sophisticated 
headmistress of the schooljoins 
in the fun asshe renews a liaison 
with a debonair suitor of the 
past. The evening blissfully 

progresses to the predictable 
"happily-ever-after" ending. 

The Hoy friend made an 
overnight success of Julie 
Andrews when it opened on 
Broadway in the early 1950s. 
Recent New York revivals have 
featured Sandy Duncan and Judy 
Carne. 

The La Jolla Stage Company's 
production is aptly directed by 
Jack Tygett. The energetic cast 
performs the melodramatic 
action and the rigorous dance 
routines with spontaneity and 
enthusiasm. A highlight of the 
show is the flaming third-act 
tango number with its

Rock and 
roll at the 
Berlin Wall 

I Anewkindo{popularmusic 
b rising from tile youth who 
liue in the literal shadow of 
fast-West confrontation. West 
Berlin teens call it "Wall Cily 
Rock," a combination of punk 
and polItical protest - a wail 
against all (orms of restrictive 
ideoloqij. 

By fRANK VIVIANO 
r .. dfic NeW5 Senice 

BERUN - For 35 year~ thi~ 
nervous, divided city has bccn a 
chief sounding board for 
superpowcr confrontation, but a 
new kind of commentary on 
East-West tcnsions, in a most 
unlikely idiom, is evolving here 
these days. 

Thc intcnsel y disaffected 
young of Berlin call it " Wall City 
Rock" - a blend of punk music 
and political critique that 
directs its anger equally at 
Washington, Moscow, and Bonn. 
It has emerged as the new 
German anthem of a generation 
that sees little but madness in 
the conservatism of its parents 
or in the dogmatic left-wing 
views of its older siblings. 

" In my film, I'm the star. I 
only get along with myself ' 
declared the lead singer ofldeal. 
one of Wall City Rock's most 
popular groups, in a recent hit 
record. "The Ice Age begins with 
me, the labyrinth ofthe Ice Age. 
Ninety degrees below zero:' 

Says Thomas Starr, a 
musician who has played with 
several local bands: "These kids 
see themselves as the crazy 
products of a time and place 
that don't make any sense: 
they've grown up in a city that is 
insane, thanks to politics. 
Logically, the wall and 

I everything else about Berlin 
I must be a joke, but it isn t. 

'What Wall City Rock says is 
that the way we are suppost.d to 
look at the world - the 

I programmed. ideological way 
- is clearly ridiculous. And it 
says it right from the gut." 

1 It also says it in verman. a 
I sharp de parture from 
, conventional pop music in this 

country. which has been 
dominated by the English 
language since the early] 950s. 
The shift started about three 
years ago. when New Wave and 
Punk records first turned up in 
Germany. A few musicians -
most notably an East Berlin 
singer named Nina Hagen -
soon began experimenting with 
German lyrics and German 
themes. 

What they discovered. 
contend some, was a perfect 
match of subject. form and 
function: the illogical nature of 
life in Berlin described in a 
harsh , staccato German that 
meshed well with Punk 's harsh, 
staccato rhythms. 

The Wall City Rock followers 
who gather at places like the So-
36 Club in Kreutzberg, an area 
along the wall known for its 
large Turkish immigrant 
population. are lumped in with 
the city's huge "alternative" 
political culture by most 
observers. But there are crucial 
differences between them and 
the " Green " alternative faction. 
which is led largely by late 
1960s student activists now 
approaching middle age,

By JOHN NEE 
As popular music undergoes 

its constant changes. the names 
and faces of the musicians tend 
to drift into a void of obscurity. 
In the entire . pop' genr£;, there 
are just too few m usiLians that 
have the ability to be 
lechnicdlly superior as well as 
creating mu~ic that "ill endure. 

. During the I 970s, a trend 
developed towards a rnuskal 
gonlOlless with the popularity 
of -,>uch bands as Van Halen, Led 
Zeppelin Rush. etc. One 
music.ian who surpassed the 
dictates of the typical public 
and maintained musical 
integrity is Robert fripp. 

Throughout his career, Fripp 
has played with the various 
incarnations of King Crimson, 
the League of Gentlemen, David 
Bowie, Brian Eno. The Roaches 
and Peter Gabriel to name a few. 
fripp also has acted as a 
producer for numerous albums 
and has written ma,IY articles on 
his approach to music in 
Musician. Since his decision in 
1967 to become a profe~ional 
musician, he has developed a 
musical technique thal has 
become Frippertronics:' 

Crimson (which he disbanded in 
1974), Fripp became a vanguard 
of the entire progres.sive 
movement that spawned such 
bands as Yes, ELP, and Genesis. 

However , fripp saw the 
beginning of the end for thC5e 
musical ideals. for a time, he 
would only appear sporadically 

plea!>e turn to page 6 

Frippertronics relies heavily 
on the use of various 
synthesizers allowing fripp to 
bring about the sounds that he 
sees that will fit into a specific 
work. In composition, Fripp 
seems to view his artistic 
contribution as one driving 
more towards a whole than as a 
chance to purely showcase a 
guitarist.

The ever-popular rockabilly maniacs. The Blasters, will appear

Lords of tbe

I in concert 
contioued from page 5 
on albums of other artists and 
took an extended hiatus from 
performing. 

During the period from 1974 
to 1977, Fripp pursued his 
education at the International 
Academy for Continuous 
Education. Finally in 1978 he 
returned to music with a solo 
preview of Frippertronics at The 
Kitchen in New York. This 
coming Wednesday, Robert 
Fripp will once again present a 
solo presentation in Mandeville 
Auditorium. Whatever Fripp 
decides to purvey on this 
particular evening should be 
more than worthwhile. 

The lords of the New 
Church will playth isevening at 
The Distillery East in Escondido. 

There will be a battle of the 
bands in Revelle Cafeteria this 
Saturday featuring The Odds, 

I Damaged Goods, No Names, The 
I Tops and who knows what else. 

Rocking at 
the 'Wall' 
continued from page 4 

The differences came into the 
open this year with the 
publication of a novel by Franz 
Joseph Degenhardt. an 
immensely popular fOlksinger 
of the earlier era. Observing the 
contemporary West German 
youth scene, with its anarchistic 
squa tter movement and 
sco rnfu l.- individualisti c 
attitudes. the chief character in 
Degenhardt 's book finds 
unacceptable chaos and an 
absence of necessary 
ideological consciousness. 

His conclusion may find a 
sympathetic reaction among 
Berl iners of Degenha rd 1's 

"The labyrinth of 
the ice age . .. 
generation. who have preserved 
the atmosphere of '60s student 
radicalism here to an uncanny 
extent. This city is the last 
stronghold of a protest-era style 
that has long since pa~('d 
almost everywhere else: Its 
co ffee shops sti II feature 
sandalwood incense, Beatles 
music and a clientele garbed in 
denim workshirts, wire-rimmed 
glasses and hiking boots. 

The Wall City Rock kids share 
these Berliners' aversion to 
being nuclear pawns, to be sure, 
as do virtually all Europeans 
under 40 today. They are much 
less inclined, however, to 
believe that any earlier decade 
offered convincing answers to 
the dilemmas of the present 
moment. 

Pointing to the Berlin Wall 
and the divisions it symbolizes, 
one Wall City Rock group calls 
upon its audience to "dance to 
the tune of Konrad Adenhauer," 
the consummate Cold War West 
German leader of the ·50s. But 
as for the '60s, proclaims Ideal, 
"All the words have been said a 
thousand times, every question 

I 
asked a thousand times, every 
feeling felt a thousand times:' 

This is " the labyrinth of the 
Ice Age," and none of the old 
ideas will eaiJy melt it. 

sturgeon: some 'special' effects --AT THE MOVIES-
continued from page J 
and he had Doug and I make Ule 
mechanisms for the anns. Rick 
then made a videotape of the 
allen and sent it over to 
Spielberg, who loved It and gave 
the go-ahead for the prc?fect," 
said Sturgeon. . 

After The Thing was finished 
Baker called Sturgeon to work 
on Videodrome. a Canadian flIm 
by David Cronen berg. 

"When I first read the script a 
was really weird. If it had ever 
been made it would have been 
rated Triple-X. It was real neat 
but it never could have been 
made. Up until a few months ago 
it was rated X, but they edited it 
down until it had an R rating:' 

There were also some 
problems with the script. 
Sturgeon, Baker and the other 
makeup artists designed effects 
for the first script. Then the 
second script changed some 
things, so they went back and 
worked on something new. By 
the fourth script things were 
rea lly busy on the set. 

"It was really hectic. but it 
made us come up with a lot of 
innovative ideas real fast when 
they chan~ed scriDts:' 

One of the most talked about 
parts of the special effects 
makeup that was done on the 
film was the casting of Deborah 
Harry's torso. 

" I didn 't do the body cast." he 
confessed. "Steve Johnson went 
up to New York to cast her torso. 
We never used it in the film. so it 
is lying around the shop 
somewhere:' 

Often the script would call for 
things that were almost 
Impossible for them to create. 
'ihe original ending would have 
been pretty weird," said 
Sturgeon. "It called for Max 
Renn (James Wood) and NJcko 
Brand (Deborah Hany) to have 
sex organs growing out of their 
hands and elbows, but this was 
changed after the first few 
scripts." 

The dark sIde of Bill Sturgeon 

One scene in particular that 
David Cronen berg was 
interested in was the one in 
which Max Renn shoots one of 
the leaders of Videodrome, 
Barry Convex. " Origi nally, 
Cronen berg had wanted a blob 
to be shot from Max's gun and 
hit Convex in the forehead, and 
then have the blob get bigger 
and start to consume him. But 
th is would have been almost 
impossible:' related Sturgeon. 

At the moment. Sturgeon is a 
college student at Loyo la 
Mar y mount University, 
majoring in communications 

and will probably switch over to 
business. But If a goodjob came 
along he would probably leave 
school to work on it. 

"looking back on the past 
few years, Rick Baker has been a 
terrific boss. Although I don't 
miss the long hours, breathing 
poisonous chemicals and 
having the pressure of getting 
hundreds of thousands of 
dollars worth of special effects 
due the next day. School is a 
different kind of pressure, you 
only have to worry about a 
grade . 

" It is magic to see the things 
that you do up on the screen. 
but most of the time it is real 
hard work. It kind of gets in your 
blood a little, and it is very 
satisfyinQ." 

Kevin Brennan who has 
work ed with _ Baker arid 
Sturgeon on American 
Werewolf (he was in the wolf 
suit during the transformation) 
and Videodrome said, " I don't 
remember laughing for the past 
few years." 

"You see the same seven 
people every day for a year. and 
you are in the same room day in 
and day out. We were thinking 
about making a film about the 
real makeup industry." 
Sturgeon dreams, "where there 
are these young people chained 
to a table in a dark dungeon 
making special effects, every 
once and a while one keels over 
and dies. Then Rick goes to his 
little Roledex and looks under 
kids from Kentucky to replace 
him:'

Israel's three- pronged dilemma 
~'on li nll('d from page 7 
IS "t he only initial I\e \~ Jth am 
realIst ic hope of working:' 
Thcse rccent dc\ elopmcnts. 
coupled with the fact that tl1(' 
Begin government itst'lf has 
\ ptoed the Reagan plan 
(because it calls for an 
immediate halt of all I"raeli 
<;ett lement s being built). "how 
that chances for a p()~lti\'e 
outcome are few. 

[f there is one neighbor uf 
fsraeJ's who cou ld stand in the 
way of peace, it is Syria. Led by 
President I [afez Assad. Syria 
ha!> been a strong supporter of 
the PLO (especially its radical 
factions) ever since Assad 
assumed power in 1971 . But 
Assad himself mu st act 
pragmaticall y if he is to 
survive. In the past year, there 
have been two attem pts from 
wi thin to overthrow hi 
government. 

In determining whether or 
not peace could come between 
Israel and Syri a, Rothman told 
the audi'ence a short story 
comparing the sincerity of 
Egypt's peace with Israel with 
that of Syria. After the 1973 
war. Rothman said. Israel and 
Egypt signed a disengagement 
agreement with Israel ending 
all hosti lities. The Israelis 
gave back to the Egyptians the 
border city of Suez. which had 
been dest royed in the war. The 
Egyptia ns rebu i I t and 
repopulated the city. 
conveyi ng the idea that they 
had set tled for peace. "Who 
would rebui ld and repopulate a 
city if they still had hostile 
intention ." asked Rothman. 
Six months after Egypt signed 
the treaty with Israel. Syria 
signed une with Israel as well. 
The Israe lis returned the 
occupied cit y of Kuneitra (the 
capital of the Golan Heights) 
back to t he Syrians. To this 
day. the city s ti ll lies in ruin . 
and sparsely popul ated. For 
Rothman, this conveys the 
idea that Syria sti ll has hosti le 
intentions. 

As for Assad, Rothman 
stated, " It 's possible Assad 
may go in the not too distant 
future. We don't know who 
will succeed him." 

The final country which 
borders Israel is Lebanon. 
"The border bet ween Israel 
and Lebanon was a quiet 

border from 191H 10 the mid 
1970s. There \\as no confllci 
on I hat horder. The C! ,n I IICI on 
that burder lwgan \\ llen the 
PLO was expelled fnH nJorrian 
and came ifllo I phanon. " 
Rothman said . li e went on to 
';tate that the PLO entered 
Lehanon via a treaty -;igned in 
CaIro. The Lebanese ngrC't'd 10 
the treaty because 1\ stipulated

Le ba nese terri tory. II owcv('r, 
"the PLO violated both points 
of the Cairo agreeml'nt." ;;aid 
Rothman. 

From areas in southern 
Lebanon. the PLO constantly 
bombarded town s and 
settlements in northern Israel. 
In 1978, to end the PLO 
attacks, Israe l invaded 
southern Lebanon. After the 
PLO was pushed back past the 
Litani river (some 25 mi les 
from the Israeli border), Israel 
agreed to a ceasefire upon the 
condition that a United 
Nations peacekeeping force ' 
move into southern Lebanon. 
A UN force moved in. but as 
soon as the Israelis withdrew. 
the PLO moved back in and 
began shelling areas of 
northern Israel once more. 
The UN failed to stop the PLO , 
and Rothman added "quite 
frankly . UN troops were 
caught gun·running for the 
PLO." 

The continued shelling of 
Israeli towns and settlements 
led to Israel's second invasion 
of Lebanon in June of 1982. 
Only this time, Israel's army 
pushed the PLO back to the 
:apital city of Beirut. where. 
after months of bitler fighting. 
the PLO agreed to leave 
southern Lebanon and Beirut. 

Rothman stated [hat the 
current problem in Lebanon 
has to do with the many 
foreign armies currently 
there. In the south and in 
Beirut are the Israelis and a 

multi·na~ional peacekeeping 
force made up of French. 
Italian, American, and a few 
British troops . In the north 
and east are PLO nd yrian 
soldiers. The Lebanese want 
all foreigners out. "The 
hangup today is that no one 
will move fir s t. " added

In addressing the massacre 
of nearly ROO Palestinians by 
Lebanese Christ tan Phalan · 
gISts I hal took placl' in thl' 
refugee camps of Sabra and 
S hat il Ia . Rot h man lold t hr 
audience that "Mas<,acres In 
Lebanon are not new." He also 
pointed out that between 1975 
and 1982, 11 0.000 people died 
in Lebanon 70,000 
Christians and 40.000 
Muslims. 

This doesn't mean however 
that Rothman condoned the 
massacre of the Palestinians. 
On the contrary, Rothman 
stated' "When Bahir Gemayel 
and 36 of his aides were kIlled . 
a fury went through the 
Phalange Party. Israel's error 
is it should have known the 
Phalange would want to take 
revenge." 

The ma!';sacre created a 
political upheaval in Israel. 
When news of the massacre 
was announced in the L raeli 
media, nearl y half a million 
people (1/7 of the popu lat ion of 
Israel) marched in Tel Aviv 
demanding an investigation as 
to Israel's role in the massacre. 
The government appointed an 
independent commission to 
look into the matter. 

Two day before ~othman 
delivered his lecture at UCSD. 
the Israeli co mmi ssio n 
concluded that certain Israeli 
officials had been negligent in 
performing their duties when 
the massacre occurred. The 
highest indicted government 
official. Defense Minister Ariel 
Sharon. was' relieved of his 
cabinet post 48 hours after the 
deci sion was handed down. 
Rothman amusingly added. 
"By the way. it took a lot 
s horter for the Is raeli 
government to act than the 
American government to act 
when it came to Watergate."

Our int~rdisciplinary cours~ on . . ~.i human sexuality was off~r~d 
for th~ rirst t1m~ in 1978. w~ ar~ ' , .' pl~~d to be able to sch~dule it 
again this spring, and welcome Interested students. 

The goal of the course Is to emphasize the place of sexuality in the 
achievement of personal identity, a social role, and a satisfying relationship with 
others. Therefore, instead of a cours~ with the exclusive emphasis on anatomy of 
sexual function and cl)sfunction (though these are included) we are offering one 
that considers human sexuality in terms of anthropology, history, literature, 
economics, the law, political science, ethno-botany, psychology, and psychiatry.

FOR ALL YOU DO ... THIS 
BUD PAGE IS FOR YOU! 

Superstars Rodeo Starts Today 
Well, pahdner, it's glttln' to be that 

time II year asln. Yessiree, Billy Bud, It 
shore does seem to come around 
Quicker these days, don't it. 
Probably ... the: biggest happenin' In 
these parts since the: last midte:rm In 
O<hem. 

Yep, it's Rodeo We:ek here at the 
UCSO Ranch. Y'know that crllZY sports 
thing the: Intramural folks call 
SuperstMs. Every kind of sports event 
that you ever heard of In that thing. 
About the: only one: they overlooked 
was my favorite ... calf-roping, 

It's suppposed to git under w/IY 
today and from what I hear the 
competition this year is going to be: a 
bambume:r. 

Folks are: comin' from all over. Rick 
Wilbet (the 1981 champ) is 

supposedly shootin' for the: record 
again (6064 points). And there's 
Elaine Bergman (UCSO's best female: 
athlete: ever) IItd Matt CIIr1son too. 
Matt's the young buck from up north 
who just missed nipping Wilbert last 
ye:lII for second place. And there'll be 
a pack of others too. Country Ed 
Novak and Eric Spangenberg, and 
Randy McNi-;:holas and Jay Kuo and 
plenty more. They'll all be there. 

Can't wait to see these fOlks shoot it 
out at the OK Corral. Those crazy 
point tables that the 1M Looney Birds 
have concocted will keep these kids 
hoppin' all weekend long. 

Yep, Billy Bud, think I'll grab a cool 
sixe:r and mosey on over to Muir Field 
this aftemoon. There ain't nothing like 
a good oI'fashioned rodeo_ 

Socccr In Thc U.S.A. 

So you thought the: Wood ':up 
soccer tournament was played last 
year In Spain amongst the: top teams 
all over the planet Well, I happen to 
know for a fact that that must have: 
been some kind of a minor league 
tournament I happened to be out at 
Lake: Pryatel field around 10:00 am 
two weeks ago and stumbled (my 
usual dipsomanic state) on these guys 
playing soccer like I have never seen 
before on this continent These guys 
were awful serious. Uniforms, $60.00 
shoes, goalie uniforms and even tan 
clubs of rabid tans, As I watched them 
play, I reaHzed that they not only 
looked the part, they played like they 
knew what they were doing. Scissor 
kick goals, head shot goals from 
parallel to the ground. Wow! Who 
were these guys? I got as close as I 
could to hear them converse:. Then I 

f--------- Superstars '83 Early Lln~ Dope Shed ------------1 realized who they were. Not one bit 
of English could be heard. These 
players were from all over the world. 
Soccer is an international sport and it 
is no different at UCSD. We have teams 
from Brazil, Argentina, England, 
Ireland, Iran and Mexico. Word has it 
that they were probably recruited 
here to win an 1M championship. I 
knew they COUldn't have been from 
the good 01 U.SA. We don't play 
soccer here, we hack at soccer.

Bud Basketball Poll 

As the games progressed I telt that 
the World Cup must be at stake. This 
was national pride at stake. This was 
the players' chance to show that it 
was a fluke that Italy was the World 
Cup champion. I don't see any way 
Italy could be any better than our very 
own Supremex led by Geralto "Fane) 
Feet" Costa or the Boca Juniors led by 
Chiemela " Lightning" Nwosa. 

The UCSD World Cup will be played 
Sunday March 13 with the winner 
advancing to the world toumey. We 
have some guys and gals who am play 
this game. We American hacks can 
learn from these friends from far away 
lands. 

Isn't it nice that we at UCSD have an 
avenue for almost everyone who 
wants to recreate?

" We became a team tonight. 
Th is was the game J was hoping 
for all season long. " 
- T riton Head Coach John 

Block 

Oh, what an upset! Only 200 
spectators were fortunate 
enough to view the UC D-
Westmont game Tuesday 
night in the Pavilion, but for 
Triton fans the game was well 
worth the price of admission, 
and (hen some. After two 
overtimes and nine lead 
changes, the men's basketball 
team accompli shed omething 
eight other teams in league 
play fai led to do: defeat 
Westmo nt. Aided by t he 
performances of Ray Banales, 
Steve Flint, Mike Dabasins-
kas. and Dave McGui re, the 
Tritons tarnished nationally 
ranked Westmont, previously 
undefeated in NAIA District 
IfI action (1 ] -0), with a 64-60 
double overtime victory. 

UCSD's ] -2-2 match-up zone 
defense was the tell ing factor 
in the Warriors' demise. 
Westmont entered the contest 
with the league's best team 
field goal percentage. 56.2% 
(five percentage points better 
than the runner up). Agains t a 
defense created by ASSIstant 
Coach Tom ;\klr~hall. the 
Warriors were onlv ah le to hit

Block while relaxing in hi s 
office after the win. "We

was probably the most intense 
game wr've player! thi . year." 

Trailing 24-22 at halftime, 
UCSD was "Iuggish in the first 
10 minutes of the seco nd half. 
The Warriors capitalized on 
three Triton turnovers and 
some defensive lapses to build 
up the largest lead of the night. 
eight points. at 41 -33 with 
!>even minutes left. Never 

quitti ng, UCSD rall ied with 
eight unanswered points to 
deadlock the contest at 4 l with 
3:20 to go. Arter tradi ng 
baskets and a free throw, 
Westmont su rged ahead 46·44 
on an l 8-foot ju mp shot by Joe 
West. With UCSD down to its 
final l4 seconds of su rvival, 
Block elected to isolate Bob 
Goodman one·on·one. It was 
pitty·pat with the old heart as 
UCSD's leading scorer drove 
the lane, s plitting two 
defenders. and launched an

College Basketball 
If Mr. Webster were a haH· 

court hoops fan, he wouldn't 
just define parity as "equality 
of power." He'd also ay it 
de cr ibes very accurately 
what's happening In the game 
of college basketball today. 

Look at the polls. The norm 
today seems to be a new ;\lo. I 
learn every week. The No. I 
pot in t he polls IS like a hot 

potato. Nobod) ~eems to want 
it. Knocking at the door ha\'e 
been Indiana, Kent uck:--. St. 
John's MiSSIssippi, trCLA, 
Virginia, plus a flot illa of 
others. 

The reasons for t his are 
many. The most ob\'ious one i . 
the freshman rule, which does 
not allow the dynasty colleges 
to tockpile the blue·chippers 
like they did year ago. What 
you used to do was bring in a 
great freshman team. break 
'em in as sophomores. and pia, 
'em as juniors and ..,enior~ . 
Today, a blue chip freshman 
wants to p1<1\ right :lway or 
he'll go somewhere el..,(' \\here 
he will. becam,e most kcepl'r~ 
have theIr eyes on the pros 
down the road . And , un like the 
sit uation in foot ball . turning a 
program around and taking a 
trip Uptown costs only a 
couple of blue·chlppers and the 
right complementary players 

What all thIS has done is 
spread the high school blue· 
chippers throughout 50 to 60 
schools in DiviSIOn I, and thi 
is a first big step toward 
equality. 

The NCAA has also lowered 
the amount of scholarships 
schools can give. At no time 
can they have more than 15 
basketball p ia) ers o n 

scholarship. T hey can bring in 
15 in one year. or spread it over 
four years. but at no time can 
th ere be more than 15 on 
scholar hip. 

That' step No.2.

coaches' salarie du ring last Friday's (Feb. 18) meeti ng. 
Obviou s ly, the s t udent voice ca n be, and in th is case was, 
acknow ledged as a legitimate opinion. For those of you who took 
the time to wr ite a letter to the Reg Fee Comm ittee, the coaches 
owe you their appreciation . 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. Fernando Va lenzuela had to 
resort to an arbitration hearing to obtai n the one mill ion dolla rs 
he so ric hl y deser ves . The "big mill " is onl y a fraction of w hat 
the " big gu y" should earn . Fernando is a t remendous attend a nce 
drav,,' both at home and on the road , a nd he eas il y generates ten 
times w hat he is paid. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. The people in the City of Brotherly 
Love have something to be happy abou t. Both the Flyers of the 
NHL and the 76ers of the NBA own t he best records in their 
respecti ve sports. The fa ns better enj oy it while they can because 
neither will go far. DEATH PREDlCTlON: the Flyers wi ll die in

those not populated by Arabs 
to remain under Israelt

Israel! concessions under

DaVId. Farouk Kadoumi . 
foreign minister of the PLO. 
ha st ated "The PLO 's 
po ition is that Israel has no 
right to exist." Another PLO 
official, Rothman said. stated 
" We are prepared to establish 
a Palestinian state on any part 
of our territory which may be 
hberated. Our first step is the 

return of Israel to the 1967 
lines. The second step IS the 
return of israel to the 19H 
partition line~. The third step 
is the democratic secular state 
of Palestine" Rothman 
interprets thIS statement as a 
denial of Israel's right to exist. 

Rot hman belteves reconcil-
iation between Israel and the 
PLO is possible. But it depends 
on the outcomes of the current 
se ion of the PNC in Algeria. 
"If they (PLO) allow Hu sein 
to move." Rothman stated. "it 
will mean a . ignificant hift in

Rothman concluded hi
