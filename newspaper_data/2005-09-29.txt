Three A.S. seats retnain vacant 
Sweeten temporarily fills two empty spots 

By ERIKA CERVANTES 
Contributing Writer 

The A.S. Council has begun 
the chool year short three mem-
bers, with no commissioner of 
alhletics, commissioner of diver-
sity affairs or vice president exter-
nal. 

Former Commissioner of 
Athletics Bryce Warwick left his 
post vacant after graduating last 
year, with the sole candidate nlll -
ning to replace him disqualified 
weeks before the election. 

In addition, former 
Commi sioner of Dive rsity Affairs 
Eiko Arseniak decided lO transfer 
out of CSD during the ~um­
Iller, leaving her position open as 
well. .S. Vice President External 
Kevin Mann resigned from his 

position on ept. 28, citing per-
sona I reasons. 

The departure of Mann and 
rseniak leaves A.S. President 

Christopher Sweeten as the o nly 
remaining candidate from last 
year's e lection who ran on the 
Student Empowerment! slate. 

weeten, however, believes that 
he can sti ll work with his current 
cabinent well. 

"The election was the election 
and that's past," Sweeten sa id . 
"Now comes who will be working 
with each other for the better-
ment of the sUldcnts on ca mpus." 

ntil the positions are filled , 
Sweetcn is juggling three major 
positions, as he continues his 
duties a~ president and also fulfills 
responsibilities of cOllllllissioner 
of diversity affai rs and athcltics. 

" I am handling the three posi-
tions with a positive attitude," 
Sweeten aid. "My concerns are 
with the students and I wa nt to 
make sure that the students who 
these positions serve are sti ll 
being fulfilled ." 

The vice president externa l 
position will be filled temporar-
ily by Sama ntha Petersen, who 
worked as an administrative liai-
son for the external office. 

Arseniak sa id that she hoped 
her old office would gain more 
recognition and funds in the 
council through the work of her 
successor. 

" It's definitely an important 
part of AS," she sa id. " Il opefu lly

Business school budget to 
include campus funding 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
News Editor 

UCSD's Rady School of 
Management, which was originally 
planned to be funded privately, 
wi ll now pull from campus funds to 
expedite the fucility's construction . 

UCSD's newest graduate school 
is receiving a boost in its capital 
budget through changes approved 
by the University of California 
Board of Regent~ at its meeting last 
week. 

The regents approved a 43.6 
million budget fo r the first phase of 
the Rady School of Management, 
a total hike of approximately $12.1 
million, to be spent on "preliminary 
plans, working drawings, conslruc-
tion and equipment, " according 

to the regents' written approval. 
Almost all of the increase will come 
from campus funding, which jumped 
from $360,000 tO$12.5 million . The 
change was requested to accolllmo-
date increases in umll1ticipated pro-
duction costs when the project wa, 
origina lly phlllned in 200 I.

Study finds finandal 
savvy among teens 
Today's teenagers, and especially 

ethnic minorities, call monetary sav-
ings a priority, according to a national 
study by FI N D /SVP. a provider of busi-
ness analysis and research. 

lMlen divided by race, the study 
found that of the 40 percent of 
participants between the ages of 14 
and 18 that have a checking accoun~ 
Hispanic teenagers rate considerably 
more likely to have a checking account 
than other ethnicities. Meanwhile, the 
report also found that Asian teenag-
ers are the most likely to save their 
finances for future use. 

Roughly 36 percent said that rais-
in~ savings IS a goal of education, with 
Asian teens ranking hi8hest in prioritiz-
ing money for schooling, followed by 
Caucasians, blacks then Hispanics. 

' Interestingly, teens across all races 
seem to conSider the same issues 
when managing their money and all 
are thinking about their future rv:JN,' 
stated Elizabeth Rowe, a senior ana-
lyst for FIND/SVP, in a press release. 
"Teens seem to have embraced new 
technologies and typically research 
the details for family purchases, but 
money seems to be a different mat-
ter. Parents and other family mem-
bers still wield that influence." 

To conduct its study, the firm sur-
veyed 300 teenagers with questions, 
that induded money-5pending habits 
and financial services. 

Brands not important 
to college students 
lMlen addressing coIlese consum-

ers, brand name recognition is not 
an extremely viable marketing tool, 
according to a new survey released 
by Anderson Analytics and BrandPort 
Insights, which are both research 
companies. 

In the survey, which came from 
1 ,000 retumin~ American college stu-
dents, no single brand was named 
as the "favorite' by more than 6 per-
cent of respondents. Of the preferred 
brands, Nike placed fi~ with Coca 
Cola in second. dothing brands Polo/ 
Ralph Lauren and American Ea~le 
both tied for third place in the study.

UCSD to host first 
mayoral debate 

San Diego Councilwoman Donna 
Frye and former Police Chief Jerry 
Sanders will face off against each 
other and field audience questions 
in the first debate between the two 
mayoral hopefuls. The even~ to be 
broadcast on UCSD-TY, will focus on 
city govemment reform, fair elections 
and effective govemance among 
other topics, accordin~ to university 
spokesman Barry Jagoda. 

Both candidates are expected to 
present plans for recCNery for San 
Diego's financial turmoil. The two-
hour public forum will begin at 6 
p.m. in Price Center Theatre on Sept 
30. Dean of Arts and Humanities 
Michael A Bemstein will moderate 
the debate. 

High definition video 
unveiled at UCSD 

Scientists from across the world 
have united through the use of a pio-
neering technology: super-high-defini-
tion digital video, which can transmit 
images at about 4,000 horizontal 
pIXels. 

Study: Survey finds liberal 
leanings in most professors 

SHD images are about four times 
the resolution of most high-defini-
tion television formats and 24 times 
crisper than a regular TV signal. The 
4,ooo-pixel broadcast there dosed a 
gap between UCSD and Tokyo's Keio 
University through 9,000 miles of 
gigab~ Intemet Protocol optical-fiber 
networks. 

The broadcast was presented by 
Keio President Yuichiro Anzai and 
UCSD Chancellor Marye Anne Fox at 
iGrid 2005, a symposium address-
ing networking technology, earlier this 
week. 

"Seeing such dramatic examples 
of networked 4K media for science, 
medicine, education, culture, art and 
entertainment inspires the imagina-
tion about what can be done with 
advanced visualization and commu-
nications technology," Fox stated in a 
press release. 

continued from page r 
the 5UJVey, s13ted in a press release 
that despite the impression cre-
ated by the nwnbers, the percentage 
of satisfied professors has increased 
over the last lwO surveys. 

"While it may be disheartening 
that just 50 percent of taday's faculty 
are satisfied with the quality of their 
students, it should be noted that 
the current figure is actually higher 
than it has been in recent years," 
Lindholm S13ted in a press release. 

Forty-four percent of educatOrs 
were satisfied with the quality of stu-
dents in 2001, while only 42 percent 
were satisfied in 1998, HER! stated 
the press release. In addition, the sur-
vey reponed that those college pro-
fessors who arc self-described liberals 
outnwnber their conservative coun-
terparts, corresponding to 52 percent 
and 20 percent of the instructor pop-
ulation, respectively. In the 2004-05 
academic year, 29 percent identified 
themselves as moderates, a conrrast 

take the 
cost 

out of your 
costume! 

to 40 percent 15 years ago, the press 
release stated. 

Faculty members' views on goals 
for undergraduate education also 
varied, although they said that the 
top three were developing students' 
abilities to think critically, helping 
students master knowledge in a disci-
pline and promoting students' ability 
to write effectively, with 99, 94 and 
87 percent of the faculty backing 
each, respectively. 

"The focus of today's faculty is 
developing the practical skills embed-
ded in a libe.ral education," UCLA 
education professor and director 
of the Higher Education Research 
Institute Sylvia Hurtado stated in a 
press release. • 

QnJy 30 percent of faculty mem-
bers view the chief aim of a college 
education as increasing students' 
financial-eaming potential.

I AJ. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
A.S. Meeting .6 - Sept. 28 

Public Input 
Students Raising A.I.D,S. 

Awareness organizer Pat AJlen 
announced UCSD's participation 
in AJ.D.S. Walk San Diego 2005, 
to be held Oct. I at Balboa Park. 
Information is available at http:// 
'IJIIII'W.llidJ"Wlllltsd.org. 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
Item B 

The council approved a con-
tract with Cloud 9 Shuttle Service 
to provide "reliable and personal-
ized" shuttle service for students 
participating in the A.S. Safe Rides 
service by a vote of 17-1-0. Under 
the deal, the council agreed to pay 
Cloud 9 a fee of $9 per hour, plus 
a one-time charge of $60. 

Item C 
Voting by consensus, the coun-

cil also retroactively approved a 
contract with appliance company 
Micro 101 to provide refrigerator, 
freezer and microwave units for 
the campus residence halls for the 
2005-06 school year. 

Reports 
President Christopher Sweeten 

Sweeten reported the recem re -
ignation of Vice President External 
Kevin Mann due (0 unspecitied per-
sonal reasons. I Ie announced the 
interim appointment of Samantha 
Peterson, an administrative liai-
son for the external office, to fiU 
Mann's position until applications 
are reviewed at a later date. 

Council Caucus 
The recent controversy over 

pornographic images on Student-
Run Television became a topic 
of debate for councilmembers as 
amendments to the A.S. Media 
Charter were being contemplated. 
The inclusion of die three-pronged 
Miller test of obscenity, which 
is designed to prevent airing of 
"obscene broadcasts" at any time, 
was debated by some as violating 
the First Amendment as weU as 
previous Supreme Court rulings 
against censorship. 

Earl Warren College Sophomore 
Senator Daniel Palay argued that 
the Miller test could ban poten-
tially inoffensive material such as 
sexual health videos from being 
seen by students. 

Members also addressed the 
ability of SRTV officials to monitor 
content and stop ~ffensive broad-
casts before they air to the public. 
SRTV co-manager Andy Tess said 
that proactivity, while potentially 
able to solve some content prob-
lems, would "open up the door" to 
potential legal troubles. 

"Don't sit around and tell me 
that you can't be proactive, because 
you ca n," Thurgood Marshall 
College Senior Senator Kate Pillon 
said in response to 1ess' statement. 

When revisions of the charter 
were addressed, councilmembers 
debated whether or not immediate 
changes would be the best course of 
action for the A.S. Council to take. 

"A change to the charter would 
be reactive, and it would be in 
error," Tess said. 

The media charter currendy 
doe not apply to SRTV.

A.S.: Sweeten to emphasize athletics post

• more funding, making it a more 
active position." 

The commissioner of athletics' 
office works with athletic depart-
ments, students and the A.S. 
Council to increase Triton pride 
and support for athletes, accord-
ing to Warwick, who described 
his former position as the founda-
tion for school enthusiasm. 

"The office serves as a cru-
cial liaison between the student 
athletes and the student govern-
ment," he said. "But on top of 
that, it's a central place for spirit 
on campus and the driving force 
behind getting people to sup-
port our teams and grow pride in 
UCSD." 

The lack of applicants for the 
commissioner of athletics posi-
tion is a possible expression of the 
lack of athletic pride at UCSD, 
Warwick said, something that 
Sweeten and others are seeking to 
change. The job's responsibilities, 
however, are specialized, Warwick 
said. 

"It takes a special kind of per-
son to have the charisma to moti -
vate and also the administrative 
slolls to be able to run an office 
and work with day-to-day details," 
he said. "Even the people who are 
excited about athletics are unable 
to make the big time commitment 
or handle things like balancing 
the budget." 

Meanwhile, Sweeten hopes to 
give the future commissioner of 
athletics a central role in A.S. 
affairs by prioritizing athletics and 
Triton pride. 

While temporarily tilling the 
position, Sweeten has attended 
freshman and transfer orienta-
tions and handed out UCSD 
Tri ton posters to celebrate school 
spirit. 

" I have made the position seem 
more approachable this quarter 

by making the position parr of 
the backbone of my agenda to 
establish a community and pride 
around Triton pride, and a lot 
of response has come forth from 
that," he said. "So all and all, mar-
keting has been the key." 

Vice Chancellor for Student 
Affairs Joseph W Watson is also 
seeking to increase emphasis of 
athletics on campus. 

Last spring, \\fa tson offered a 
proposal to the faculty Academic 
Senate that would give athlet-
ic scholarships of $500 to each 
UCSD athlete, new and continu-
ing, provided they meet a mini-

" A great academic 
and research 

institution can 
co,exist with a great 
athletic institution," 
- BIyce WcIIWic:k. fOrmer 

AS. commissioner 
of athletics 

mum GPA requirement . 
Watson developed the pro-

posal in an attempt to comply 
with recently modified CAA 
Division-II regulations that 
require universities to offer a 
minimum of $250,000 in athletic 
scholarships by this fall. UCSD 
has obtained a waiver from the 
requirement for the 2005-06 aca-
demic year, but Watson hope that 
his proposal will meet approval by 
the senate, or that a joint commit-
tee offaculty, stude nts and admin-
istrators will offer an alternative 
this year. 

"The proposal 'for athletic 
grants-in-aid has hecn designed 
to complement the mission, phi-

losophy and priorities of CSD, 
including the co-curricular needs 
and interest of students and the 
campus community," Watson 
aid. "I believe there is interest in 

athletic among UC 0 snldents. 
Most of the students .I've spoken 
to expre s a strong wish for inter-
collegiate athletics to contribute 
to school spirit and excitement on 
campus." 

Warwick, who worked on the 
scholarship propo allast year, also 
said that an emphasi ' on atilletics 
increases school pride, leading to 
larger donations from alumni . 

"The more you love your 
school ... the more you'll givc 
later," he said. "Athletics docs a 
lot to increase pride." 

vore on the proposa 1 was 
delayed until this fall, as some fac-
ulty members expressed concerns 
that the scholarship would take 
emphasis away from academics. 

However, UC D deserves an 
athletic image that mirrors the 
high academic standard on cam-
pus, Warwick aid. 

.. A great academic and re earch 
institution can co-exist with a 
great ath letic i nstirution," he ~aid . 
"[The scholarship proposal] is not 
a huge measure that will dr:lSti-
cally reshape the campus, hut it's 
definilelya start." 

The A.S. Council will fill the 
empty spots by conducting an 
open application proce s, which 
will continue until 4 p.m. Sept. 
30, at which point applicants will 
parricipate in screening inter-
views with Sweeren and rwo A.S. 
senators, according to Sweeten. 
Currently, the response has been 
largely positive, Sweeten ~ald , and 
he is pushing for approval o f lhe 
rwo positions by the third week or 
thiS' quaner.

A.S. enterprises in need 
of major reinvention 

T he central lesson from the mess that is the A.S.-Micro 10 1 enter-
prise should not be about 
ethics, but about the dysfunc-
tion that plague .. -run 
businesses. 

A~ Micro 101 shows, the 
enterprise office is stuck 
hetween a rock and a hard 
place, without clear vision or 
purpose. The A.S. Council 
must urgentlr answer the fol-
lowing questions: Is the office 
designed to build successfu l 

bll~ines'je,> and student entre-
preneurship opportunities 
- irre~pective of their va lue 
to the student body? Should 

thl:~ generate :1 health¥ prof-
it, instead of simply breaking 
even? 

Part of tile problem is the 
structure of enterpl; es. Many 
run as parmerships with out-
side departments, . which 
dilutes risk and costs - the 
goal of the parmership - but 
also reduces authority and 
accountability. No rrue busi-
ness venture would wvive 
under such an arrangement. 

But the bigger challenges 
lie in the structure of the 
enterprise operations office. 

Currentiy, its commissioner-
ship serves as a stepping-stone 
for students interested in 
hjgher office, elected largely 
on campaign promises not 
on business qualifications . 
Once in office, candidates 
lack the instin.tional knowl-
edge to direct managers, who 
actually run each enterpri e. 

An easy solution is to make 
the office an appointed one 
- like the commissioner of 
advocacy, anotiler position 
that requires s~cialized skill. 
Raising the office's stature to 
the level of a vice presidency 
would also help, attracting 
more qualified candidates. 

A second problem, though, 
is more difficult to solve: the 
failure of imagination, one 
made clear by comparing 
UCSD's office to the one 
run by Stanford Univer ity's 
student government, the 
model on whjch our office 
was based. The big debate 
in last year's A.S. election 
was the viability of an ice 

.cream cart in Price Center; 
at Stanford, the enterprises 
office rwlS a $6-million bank-
ing and investment venture. 
The contrast is stark enough. 

A.S. should save budget 
surplus for a rainy day 

W hat was initially a blessing, a spnre L03,198.95 in the 
AS budget, may actually be 
a curse for the council, with 
infighting and bickering for 
the extra funds an inevita-
ble result. A first reaction 
for councjlmembers may be 
to flash back to last year, 
accounting for Ijne items cut 
in months of budget talks. 
However, they must restrajn 
themselves. 

For example, student out-
reach, extra funds for which 
snldcnts vetoed, may be a pri-
ority for many councilmem-
bers. But they must remem-
ber that tile tudent Initiated 
Outreach and Recmianent 
Commission failed to spend 
all of its allocation from last 
year, which suggests that car-
ryover monies should not to 
go to outreach wHil a con-
crete spending plan is in 
place. 

Perhaps the best idea 

comes from Vice President 
Finance Greg Murphy, who 
suggested a broad, but safe, 
option: Place the windfall 
into general unallocated, the 
biggest pot in the budget 
available for genera l use. 

This proposal would not 
raise unrealistic expecta-
tions for .nextyear and would 
give the AS. Council much 
more flexibiljty in distrib-
uting funds. The council 
would also be able to bet-
ter scrutinize organizations 
and programs that request 
funding. In addition, extra 
ftlllds in the unallocated pot 
would provide a hedge for 
unexpected costs not already 
included in the budget. The 
need for wlbudgeted u e 'i 
almost guaranteed to arise 
again in hiring lawyers for 
co-op negotiations, which 
are approaching a close. 

"Save for a rainy day" may 
be the best adage to heed in 
upcoming weeks.

Super.-friends Donna Frye and Pat Shea 
team up to take on San Diego's fiscal crisis 

lines in 
the sand 

Ian s. Port 

One is a sun-worn surfer-activist who wants to open the long-closed doors of 
local government. The other is 
a clean-cut, Harvard-educated 
business attorne), with a pen-
chant for frankness . 

They seem like an unlikely 
pair. But Donna Frye made a 
great deci ion when she brought 
in friend and fir t-round oppo-
nent Pat Shea as an adviser, 
adopting parts of his shrewd plan 
for San Diego's recovery intaV1er 
platform. 

He may look like a square, 
but Shea has one of the brightest 
minds in the city these days. It's 
often overlooked that this San 
Diego boy earned hoth an MBA 
and a JD from Harvard - not 
one after the other, but concur-
rently. 

The Tvy-Leaguer lends one 
more awesome credential to the 
Frye camp: He's got the only 
per pective on the city's prob-
lems that's clear enough to work. 
(VVhether or not that will get 
Frye elected is another story.) 

Why do Frye and Shea hold 
the only key that will work? The 
city's mess is fabulously com-
plicated - few even pretend to 
understand all of it - bllt- the 

years of ugliness present us with 
one glaring fact: The city owes 
at least $1.7 billion more than 
it has. 

The recipients of that money 
are now set to be city workers 
- many of them union members 
- whose leaders basically took 
pension benefits instead of big-
ger pay increases. 

Since the le.lders, who were 
on the pension board, were going 
to benefit (far more than the 
workers), the benefits are prob-
ably illegal - although the ques-
tion of their legality and how 'to 
determine it is still a fiery topic 
among many, including the can-
didates. 

So San Diego has thousands 
of workers who were guaranteed 
more money than the city can 
pay them. This leaves two clear 
options: Cough up the money, 
or find a way to pay the workers 
less. Since pans of the workers' 
pensions are probably (definitely, 
according to the city attorney) 
illegal, and San Diego is a rather 
poor city these days, Frye and 
Shea's answer is: Get the benefits 
declared illegal, and find a way 
not to pay them. 

That last part is trickiest -
getting worker to show up to a 
meeting and discuss how much of 
their pay they are going to give 
up. That's the part that Pat Shea 
- and now Donna Frye - have 
a good plan for. 

Shea's original plan was 
to take the City of San Diego 
through a court-ordered Chapter 

9 Municipal Reorganization. 
Some call it bankruptcy, though 
Shea shied away from that term 
in prilllary debates for obvious 
reasons. 

That was a good plan for 
one reason: The ta k of coax-
ing workers - for whom the 
semilegal pension benefits are 
earned - to the bargaining table 
to give up their pay is impos-
sihle. A restructuring would 
reverse the situation: If work-
ers want pensions at all, they 
would have to negotiate with 
the court-appointee! bankruptcy 
agent - the city council. 

Unper that plan, the same 
corrupt group that got the city 
into this mess would be the one 
responsible for getting it out. So 
Frye did Shea one better: Instead 
of a bankruptcy proceeding, Frye 
plans to get the voters to pass 
a multifaceted ballot measure 
that would, among other things, 
reduce the benefits to an afford-
able leveJ, easing the city out of 
the huge pension deficit. 

There are other ways to do it: 
Frye's opponent, Jerry Sanders, 
wants a court to decide the legal-
ity of the benefits while mortgag-
ing city land and issuing more 
debt in the form of pension-
obligation bonds to pay down 
the deficit. He also wants to fire 
300 city workers to trim the fat 
... though he doesn't \mow who 
JUSt yet. , 

Sanders thinles he can get the

Christian schools can teach their own curricula 
But they can't make serious universities accept religion as science 

8y MARIANNE MADDEN 
Opinion Editor 

I magine wallcing into a college calculus course on the first day only' to have the lecture inter-
rupted by a snldent who rejectS 
the mathematical tenet that 
2+2=4. Or watching your study 
partner struggling with physics 
assignments because shc refuses 
to aclcnowledge the law of grav-
ity. Or listen to your roommate 
creating a ruckus in his history 
class when he publicly disavows 
the existence of azi concentra-
tion camps. 

Sound absurd? Sure it is. It 
goes without saying that to grasp 
certain subjects at a college level, 
one must accept the keystone 
of various discipline from which 
all else follows: the syn tax of the 
English language for a writing 
class; properties of numbers in a 
math class; or evolution in a biol-
ogy class. 

The UC system alleges, cor-
rectly, that gaining a decent 
knowledge of high school-level 
biology only follows from grasp-
ing the theory of evolution and 
that Creation-centric science pro-
grams don't do enough to pre-
pare students for college-level 
science courses; nor do they fuJ-
fill UC admis ions requirements. 
in retaliation, the Association of 
Christian Schools Lnternational, 
representing more than 800 
Christian schools in California, 
is suing the university for dis-
crimination. According to them, 
enforcing clearly defined admi~­
sions requirements is tantamount 
to quashing freedom of speech 
and religion. 

Taylora Dial, the principal of 

one of the schools in question, 
Calvary Baptist, alleged in an 
Inland Valley Daily Bullet in article 
that graduates are put at an unfair 
disadvantage by the university'S 
admissions requirements. She 
fails to acknowledge, however, 
that the Christian high schools 
themselves are putting students at 
a disadvantage. Most high schools 
list "college preparation" as their 
primary goal, and those that take 
it to heart equip srudents well 
for writing essays, 

" 

When a student's high school 
education is so obviously lack-
ing, the University of California 
is hardly displaying "hostility 
towards Christianity" (as the suit 
alleges) in rejecting such courses 
or such students. It is displaying 
hostility toward ignorance and 
closed-minded ness. 

It's not surprising that in the 
ACSI's mission to C hristianize 
the university, it attacks the very 
right of the university to enforce 

any admissions 
critica l thinking 
and other chal-
lenges of college. 
It's abundantly 
clear that Christian 
high schools, on 
the other hand, are 
doing nothing of 
thc sort. How can 
they ever expect 
their tudents to 
do well in college 
when their sci-
ence curriculum 
has Creationism 
at its center while 
evolution hovers 

. awkwardly in the

standards at all. 
Yes, the C sys-
tem is public; but 
every university, 
whether public 
or private, has 
admission stan-
dards of some sort 
or another. Not

grasping the theory 

.1 l ' " OJ eva utzan ... Of course, it is 
worth remember-
ing that a certain 

percentage of such Christianized 
hjgh school graduates wish to 
pursue a nonscientific course of 
study in college, and their igno-
rance of evolution becomes moot. 
No doubt a staunch Creationi t 
could do fine as a literature major. 
Yet, still, we come back to uni-
versity's goal of providing a well-
rounded student, and only acccpt-
ing students who have already 
completed a broad, well-rounded 
course of srudy. And even non-
science majors often have to pass 

shadows, at best? 
One Christian 

school, the Calvary Chapel 
Christian School of Murrieta, 
isn't just botching its teaching 
of biology - the University of 
California also refuses to accept 
its physics, history, government 
and English courses because the 
texts used are "primarily religious 
texts." What, then, are these 
kids being taught, if not biology, 
physics, history, government or 
Engli h? A few words of Spanish 
between Bible study and chapel, 
pcrhaps? 

science-related general education 
requirements in college, which 
often entails taking at Icast onc 
class that has evolution as its obvi-
ous or implied cornerstone. 

One must also remember 
that there are Christian srudents 
aplenty in the UC system, prov-
ing that being Christi;!n and being 
able to function in a world where 
evolution is the basi of science 
classes arc not mutually exclusive. 
Few of such successful Christian 
students came from as fundamen -
talist Christian of high schools 
as the ones represented in th e 
lawsuit, and the pigheadedness of 
the suit reminds us why. 

When the ACS I builds up the 
straw man of the University of 
California squashing freedom of 
speech and religion, they forget 
the legions of Christian students 
who are, at this very moment, 
enjoying freedom of religion and 
freedom of speech, and are al 0 
willing to familiarize themselves 
with evolution (even if they don't 
accept it as fact) so as to pass their 
science classes. Being Christian 
and being educated aren't at 
odds; they only clash when cer-
tain religious schools teach such a 
dismally narrow curriculum that 
their students emerge without the 
knowledge needed for college or 
the real worle!. 

After all, a student cannot sur-
vive college courses on Christian 
dogma alone. Well, unless it's one 
of the many Christian universi -
ties around the country, like Bob 
Jones University - which gradu-
ates of Christian schools are wel -
come to attend if the University 
of California is truly too stringent 
and narrow-minded in its admis-
sions standards.

It might work. That 's really 
the best that can be said. Because 
when it comes down to it, what 
motivation is thcre really under 

anders' plan for workers to give 
up the pay they earned? 

There really isn't any. Thc 
pension boa~d has already com-
pletely refused to give up docu-
ments necessary to get the city 
going again out of consideration 
for its own self-interests. "''hat's 
to keep thcm from saying they 
earned their benefits and the city 
can sell "surplus real estate" and

or four or five decades to make

Rady: Local 
market created 

difficulties 
continued from page I 

million earlier this year, lleUmann 
said. Since then, the university has 
implemented several cost-saving 
changes to the project's bid, includ-
ing allowing contractors more free-
dom in choosing materials, lowering 
the overage by $3 million. 

"Coming from campus sources, 
I funding for the construction of 
facilities) will slow down current 
construction projects," Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox told the regents 
at the meeting. "But this is a large 
investtnent that we should make as 
soon as we l.'3I1." 

The business school open ed 
last week in temporary quarters at 
Pepper Canyon Hall. ' Iroubles with 
the construction of the school were 
caused by S'an Diego's super-heated 
real estate market, Fox said. 

The sa turation of the market, 
combined with contractors over-
loaded with projects and downtown 
Sa n Diego's urban high-rise devel-
opment plan, is only one of the 
factors that has delayed construction 
and increased costs, according to 
HeUmann. 

"We are dealing with an incred-
ible set of circumstances," he said 
at the meeting. "We don't tltink the 
facility is toward the exmlVagant side 
in budget design, but rather toward 
the modest ide, when compared to 
schools we arc competing with." 

Despite rising costs, Fox clllpha-
sir.cd the need LO establish a well-
funded faci li ty for the school. 

"We recognire that the busi-
ness world is a very competitive 
sphere," she said. "And the tempo-
rary housing that we have right now 
is not equivalent to the talent of the 
students we have and want to he 
artracting." 

Rady School of Management 
was first approved by the regents 
in 2(0), and currently enrolls 174 
students. Sixty of those are full-time 
M SA students, while 114 are in the 
FlcxMBA program, which enrolls 
wqrking professionals. The school 
currently has II faculty members. 

The school will also eventua ll ), 
-be self-funding, relying primarily on 
executive education, tuition, grants 

. and contracts, as well as philanthrop-
ic support from donors, according to 
Dean Robert S. Sullivan. Students 
and faculty plan to move into new, 
more pennanent facilities in spring 
2007, he said. 

Originally, the school was sched-
uled for a fall-2003 opening, with 
preliminary plans that placed the 
school ill the northwest region of 
ca mpus, according 11) a university 
press release. 

A total of $31 million dollars was 
eamtarked for the first phase of the 
school 's construction, and so far $27 
million has been raised, with the 
bull< coming from businessman and 
investor Ernest Rady. The universi-
ty is confident that it can obtain the 
remaining funds, Hellmann said. 

The budget's augment2tion will 
not only allow the university to 
move Rady School of Management 
from its temporary quarters, but will 
spare space for a booming under-
graduate population, Fox told the 
regents. 

"Undergraduate growth. has far 
outstripped our buildings to accom-
modate them," she said. "We're 
always playing catch-up, since we've 
increased 4,000 full-time [students) 
in over five years." 

In addition, the regents approved 
the design of UCSD's east campus 
graduate housing project at their 
meeting. The project, with 800 beds 
for graduate students, will relieve 
burden on students, given the high 
cost of rent in San Diego, Hellmann 
said. The regents' approval moves 
the project's construction forward, 
with a groundbrealcing held earlier 
this week.

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2005 THE UCSO GUARDIAN 

. Report: Watson to create more committees 
continued from page I 

made multiple recommendations, 
including increasing the number 
of events where alcohol is per, 
mitted and generating campus-
wide discussion on the topic. 

A recommendation thar could 
radically improve student expl!-
rience is on-campus housi ng, 
according to Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox, who identified under-
graduates as a key area of empha-
sis upon her arrival last year. 

"I've always been a proponent 
of better housing options for stu-
dents," Fox said. " tudents who 
are on campus longer feel CO;l-
nected to UCSD in a way that 
ultimately leads to a better col-
legiate experience." 

The USESC surveys echoed 
Fox's feelings, reporting that 
commuters were 20 percent more 
likely to feel secluded from cam-
pus li fe than those wh o lived on 
campu . Currently, the university 
guarantees two yea rs of on-cam-
pus housing for incoming fresh-
men, which the committee hopes 
to expand into a four-yea r prom-
ise. However, both the commit-
tee and Fox acknowledged major 
hurdles in the plans for a more 
extensive undergraduate housing 
plan . 

"We've been sea rching for 
ways to move forward in housing 
plans, but we have this problem 
with debt capacity," Fox aid. 
"The question is, 'How do we 
match our budget to implemen-
tation?'" 

C urrently, the best option 
under consideration is to go to 
a third-party builder, Fox said. 
Meanwhile, the committee pro-
duced no concrete suggestions 
about how to develop a four-year 
housing guarantee . General rec-
ommendations by the committee 
are evidence that there shou ld 
be, and will be, further work 
on issues raised by the report's 
findings, ::ccording to commit-
teemember and Associate Vice 
Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Education Mark I. Appelbaum. 

"There's no silver bullet, and 
we malce it obvious throughout 
the whole report that there is no 
cure-all method for our campus," 
he said. "While there are many 
items that can be immediately 
addressed, there is much more 
work that has to be done through 
ongoing discussions and tasks to 
be fulfilled.» 

As of now, specific areas are 
not important, as the campus 
should first address broader prin-
ciples of things, according to Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
J oseph W. Watson, who, along 

with former Acting Senior Vice 
Chancellor of Academic Affairs 
David R. Miller and form er Vice 
Chancellor of Externa l Relations 
James M. Langley, was charged 
with assembling the committee. 

" It's important not to pigeon-
bole results and recommendations 
that the committee released ," 
Watson said. "Subtleties are 
critica l, but discussion is most 
important to have in a campus 
conununity before we move for-
ward." 

While some members of the 
A.S. Council expressed enthusi-
asm at the committee's findings, 
others were leery of the possibil -
ity of tangible results from the 
report. 

" There's 110 silver 
bullet, and we make 
it obvious throughout 
the whole report that 
there is no cure,all 

method far 
our campus. " 

- Maril L ~beum, 
associate vice chancellor 

of ur.deiiiaduate 
educ.ition 

"1 feci that the establishme nt 
of this committee was a step in 
the right Idirection) ," Thurgood 
Marshall College Junior Senator 
Jason Hoskins stated in an e-
mail . "It involved current stu-
dents , as well as alumni and staff. 
However, ] don 't feel that the 
report as a whole is a concrete 
step in any direction . The truth 
of the matter is th at UCSD is 
stretched to the limi ts of what 
we can expand/improve on cam-
pus." 

Fox, however, said that the 
report would not be "shelved 
away," but would be part of an 
ongoing effort underway by mul-
tiple administrative offices. 

The committee itself recom-
mended action by the external 
relations, student affairs and aca-
demic affairs depanrnents on th e 
report's findings. The student 
affairs office is in the process of 
fonning committees to address 
appropriate specific recommen-
dations, according to Watson. 

"The real value of our report 
on undergraduate life is yet to 
come," he said. "It is not what's 

been done at this point, because 
we have the task of integrating 
everything we've discovered into 
campus life and actively engaging 
the principles we have established 
for ourselves." 

Ithough it is not yet a cer-
tainty, each department plans to 
publicize the resul ts of individual 
committees quarterly, Watson 
said. 

The report a lso contained 
"key recommendations," which 
covered all of the needs the com-
mittee felt sh o uld have been 
add ressed. One recommendation 
to "address the need for a greater 
physical, socia l and emotio nal 
community" included proposals 
to enhance campus shuttle sys-
tems, while anotll er encouraged 
improvement of sUldent-faculty 
relations. 

The findings , released last 
week, were produced through 
committee dialogue with stu-
dents and campus groups. T he 
committee organized its findings 
inro nine basic principles. 

"This wasn't just data col-
lection from papers," commit-
tee co-chair and Sixth College 
Provost Gabriele Weinhausen 
said. " [USESC membersl went 
out and asked sUldcnts, faculty 
and staff the daring questions, 
which led to more questions, 
which led to even morc ques-
tions. In doing that, we exposed 
many weak points of the campus, 
which was a novel and very pow-
erful way of approachin g such a 
report. " 

The report 's principles include 
campus "support of the transi-
ti on to adulthood" and "focus 
on studenr housing options" for 
undergraduates, who account for 
roughl y 80 percent of UCS D 's 
student population. 

To publish the report, USESC 
met weekly as a focus gro up 
and discussed plans and conclu -
sions, according to member and 
Revelle College A.S. representa-
tive Jared Feldman. The com-
mittee also met with 20 cam-
pus groups, including. the A.S. 
Council, every college council 
and the Interfraternity Council 
to hear concerns and sugges-
tions on what issues to include in 
the report. Data were also vital 
to the process, Feldman said, 
explaining that the committee 
used statistics from various sur-
veys in the report. In addition , 
US ESC accepted an)' UCS D 
stude nt's comments through a 
Web site.

Not your father's John Cage: the mutant bass versus the hyper piano 
By MEHRDAD YAZDANI 

Senior Staff Writer 

Mark Dresser has bee n a UCSD music facul ty mem-ber sinee the fall of 200-l 
and has wowed audiences in the 
San Diego comillunity ever since. 
It is no wondcr, having toured 
and workcd with such impo rtant 
figures as Anthony Braxton, J ohn 
Zorn alld countless others, that 
Dresser produces such crushing 
~ounds . T he concert reperto ire of 
thc lasr acadeillic yea r was hest 
highlightcd by the duo of teacher 
and world master Bert Turetzky 
and Mark Dresser a the two 
accomplished b3~si;rs played a 40-
plu,> minute set.

Elcctro-Acoustic Improvisation 
Quartet" October 2 at 8 p.m. in 
Warren Lecture I hili Snldio A. 

Guordiall: So what should audi-
ences expect from a concert 
titled "UC E lectro-Acoustic 
Improvisation Quartet"? 

MD: Well , first of all, this quar-
tet will consist of two musicians 
and two computer musicians. The 
computer musi cians will be trig-
gcring sampled sound s from thc 
computer. 

Then there is a jazz pianist 
and composer who will be play-
ing hyper piano. Ilyper pi ano is a 
rather elaborate tcchnique of the 
pianist not just playing the piano 
in the usual way but also hitting 
the stri ngs of the piano and how-
ing the strings and th rowing balls 
and various objects at the strings. 
It 's different fro m J ohn Cage's pre-
pared piano stuff. The piano here 
is filirly unprcparcd. 

s for me, I' ll be playing a bass. 
I'll be having a kind of mutanr 
bass actuall>" something that has 
custom-made pickups insta ll ed in 
it that wi ll ampli fY frequen cies you 
dOll 't no rmally hear. 

G: I've noticed that you've 
been working with electronics 
and electronic musicians for a 
long time, since at least the 
early '80s. For example, on the 
work "Invocation," you worked 
with electronic musician and 

composer Lamont Wolfe. 
Of (.'Ourse, the digital age has 
greatly changed the way things 
are done over the years. How 
do you feel that your work has 
been impacted with the digital 
revolution? 

MD: I rea lIy am sti ll an acous-
tic Illusician . What I ampli fY on 
the bass arc sounds I call mjcro-
sounds. These are the sounds 
that [ can hear when practicing 
but no one else can hear. ruse 
microphon es or various means to 
amplifY and blow up these fre-
quencies and make them have 
a real mu sica l pre ence. T ha t's 
a road tha t I've been develop-
ing for over 20 years. I sta rted 
Otlt with microphones and then 
crucle bass-guita r pickups. Now, 1 
have magneti c pi ckups embedded 
into thc neck and I ca n access a 
whole range of new sounds. So 
I'd like to say that one person's 
noise is another person 's music. I 
find that parts of the sound that 
people used to consider defects 
have become a rea lly rich part of 
the voca bulary and you can find 
mea ning in them .

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN IIIATUS 9 

. r""" .... :"ft'''~-----------------­~."UI U1l15~ 

Little Brother, the orth Carolina col-lective consisting of MC's Phonte, Bi g Pooh and producer 9th Wonder, has 
given K:l nye Wcst's Late Regist" atioll a se ri-
ous run for its money with The Mimtrel 
Show. This sophomore effort ea i1 y avoids 
any sort of slump with a clever co ncept and 
perfect execution. 

The Minm·e! Sbow takes th e form of 
V B ,a fictional TV station, in order to 
sa tire hip-hop 's superficiali ty in th e 21st 
century. Though skits arc usually needless 
filler, here they are h ilarious pokes at hip-
hop fad s and fashiun trends. "Ch eati n" is 
a laugh-out- Ioud parody of today's R&B 
music, yet it is still better than any part of 
R. Kelly'S · ·II'a pped in th c Closet." 

It is not, however, all fun and ga mes for 
Little Bro ther. Phonte ,md Bi g Poo h pen an 
ode to their fathers on "All For You ," and 

LiHle Brother 
The Minstrel Show 

Atlantic 

"Sincerely Yours" is Big Pooh's respon -e to 
those who ca ll him " the weakest link" in the 
collective. T he twO address cyni cal critics 
unable to recognize a cla ssic album when 
they see onc on "Not Enough," one of the 
stronger tracks on the disc. 

Lyricall y, Big Pooh and especially 
Phonte are very impressive. but what really 
makes this album great is the consisrently 
soulful production of 9th Wonder. The 
common thread of simple drum bcats with 
well-chopped soul sa mpl es ho lds the proj -
ect together. This is without a doubt the 
best hip-hop album of the year for a very 
simple reaso n, articulated by Phonte: "dope 
beats, dope rhymes, what more do y'a ll 
want?" Indeed .

Devendra Banhart 
Cripple Crow 

On one level it see ms co mplete ly wrong to ca ll Dcvendra Banhart's C,·ipple C1"01I' mature. Its 22 songs waft between child-
ish romanticism and solemn innoccnce, even 
waxing dopey to a point wh ere it seems 
Banhart mi ght be going off the deep end. 
But that's remarkably different from his last 
two records, where h e spent Illany moments 
hangin g over the edge. 

Looking back from the light of tllis new 
document, it's cl ear how Banhart's ga-ga-
guru pe rsonality effort obscured the rugged 
grace of his older songs: Ln place of the 
overdone vocal vibrato he used to tllrow in 
everywhere, Banhart sings, sometimes in hi s 
native Spanish, with straight-up sin cerity. 
King Weirdo's vocals sti ll have their warbly 
quirks, but now he's got a voice, not a gim -
mick. 

XL 

**** Similarly, his songs have grown into deli -
cate, diverse movements where echoes of 
Latin percussion envelop imprompnl hip-
pi e howls, and might t hen rep out into a 
reverb-y, electric rock-stomp or somcwhere 
equally far- flung. T he lush piano rippl es o f 
" Ikard omcbody Say" watercolor a back-
ground as effortlessly bea utiful as any of his 
previous nmes, with war-lamenting lyrics so 
heart-pluckjngly simple they could have been 
penned hy a toddler. 

That line between the absurdi ty and pro-
fundity of youthful naivetc has always been 
home nlrf for Banhart. U nlike his previous 
efforts, C,·ipple c,'ow puts him confidently on 
the profound side.

Ali Farka Toure and Toumane Diabate 
In the Heart of the Moon 
World Circuit/Nonesuch 

A Ii Farka Toure was once known as "The Bluesman of Africa ." That is, before he quit the music business to become a rice 
filrmer in Timbuktu. Since then, the noble-
born Toure has been elected mayor of his 
region, coming out of hiding only a few times 
to record, and somehow winning a Grammy 
in the process. This time, its a live recording 
with Toumane Diabate, the second-genera-
tion kora (the West Afriean harpllute) player, 
who is injmjtable on the instrument, sound-
ing like a harpsichord-playing). S. Bach from 
the jazz era, elCcept from Mali, and playing a 
completely different instrument. 

The set was rccorded live in six hours 
(though there are unnecessary overdubs by 
Ry Cooder and Co.), an unbelievable feat 
in the face of the complexity and beauty of 

**** Diabatc's melodies, which are complimented 
by TourC's unusually gentle, rain-like gui tar. 
T he music is inspired and engaging as thc 
pair maintain an ambient tonc, each player 
responding to the other with understated 
virtuosity. As the story goes, when John Lee 
Hooker introduced Toure to the blues, Toure 
instantly recognized tile elements o f his folk 
music in its American derivative. Toure plays 
the African blues, a more unrestrained blues 
than Hooker could have imagined, but sti ll 
ba sed on call -and-response, improvisation 
and soul. Diabate may be the most vocal 
player on the album, but soul radiates from 
Toure, the Mayor of thc African Blues.

THURSDAY. SEPTEMBER 19, 1005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

CuR director explores the m.., sides of violence 
By CHRlmNE CLARK 

Associate Hiatus Editor 

Can violence be a good 
thing? However unsettling 
that may be, that is a question 
posed in David Cronen berg's 
latest, "A History ofViolence, " 
one of his best works to date. 
In this brilliant portrait of 
a man facing what mayor 
may not be his past, Viggo 
Mortensen plays -10m Stall, a 
character who embodies the 
all-American filJnily man - a 
pillar of his Midwest com-
munity, a loving husband to 
his wife (Maria Bello) and 
a caring father to his young 
daughter and teenage son . 
But his tranquil life is dis-
rupted when Stall, who runs a 
diner in a small Indiana town, 
thwarts a robbery in his coffee 
shop and almost effortlessly 
kills the assailants. Tne men-
tion am-acts a menacing mob-
ster named Carl Fogarty (Ed 
Harris) who approaches Stall 
and his family and claims that 
Stall is a fonner Philadelphia 
mobster named Joey Cusack 
- a notoriously ultra-vio-
lent man who scraped out 
Fogany's eye with a piece of 
barbed wire decades prior. 
Fogarty is upset and wants 
revenge, but his. threats to 
, tall's family force them to 
confront the fact that their 
passi e father might nOl be 
the man he ays he is. 

A HistDry of VIOlence 

**** Stamng Viggo Mortensen, 
Maria Bello. Ed Hams 

Dlrected by DaVId Cronenberg 
Rated R 

It is a straightforward story, 
but it wmlvels in a highly 
innovative fashion. Although 
the film deals with the Irish 
mafia and was loosely based 
on a graphic novel, it is more 
of a small-town character 
study than a big-city crime 
saga. 

"History of Violence" 
explores the intoxicating 
effects of violence by com-
paring it to drug abuse. 
Violence gives people power, 
but it deteriorates the foun-
dations of familial relation-
ships. "History" shows how 
thugs and heroes use violence 
everywhere in society, even 
in sleepy Middle America. 
Each of Stall's family has to 
cope with violence in their 
own way, including Stall's 
16-yea r-old son (Ashton 
Holmes), who battles a vio-
lent buJly at school. 

In addition to slcillful sto-
rytelling, it is the sUI>crb per-
fonnances by the venerable 
cast that enhance the film 
overall. Harris and William 
Hurt both· ret..sh their roles 

Film 
REVIEW 

as ruthless mobsters, each 
playing their parts with a 
blend of sarcasm and mer-
cilessness. Bello, who has 
many intensely sexual scenes 
with Mortensen, gives a dar-
ing performance as Stall's 
distraught yet devoted wife_ 
But it is Mortensen's complex 
perfonnance as a man who 
can convince his family that 
he is a loving father and a 
sadistic lciller within the same 

. moment that is both captivat-
ing and chilling to watch. 

Cronenberg has been 
hailed as an actor's director 
on par with Clint Eastwood. 
His past works include 1988's 
"Dead Ringers" and 2002's 
"Spider," and with his latest, 
he continues to delve deep 
into the psychological depths 
of his characters. Mortensen's 
Tom Stall is his most seduc-
tive thus far .

Playoffs: Cardinals, Astros,. 
Angels, BoSox to advance 

continued from page f 6 
three in Boston and grab the East, 
leaving the BoSox in a tie with 
C leveland for the wild card. Boston 
will win the tiebreaker match and 
that leads us to a White Sox vs. 
Red Sox and Yankees \'s. Angels 
division series. 

Yankees vs. Angels 
I despise the Yankees more 

than any other team in profes-
sional sportS. They have an unfair 
advantage in payTolI in a game 
that should mandate a level play-
ing field. However, 1'1\ discuss 
this ar a later dare. The 2005 
Yankees are not the caliber of 
previous Yankee teams. Randy 
Johnson wa thought 10 be a good 
pick-up. ) lowever, he , like his 
fellow overpaid Yankee pitchers, 
has performed below expectations 
with a subpar season. The Yankee 
lineup is :fs terrifying as it has 
been in years past, but I don't sec 
the Yankee pitchers being able to 
quiet Big Daddy Vladdy Guerrero 
or the rest of the stocked Angel 
lineup. Meanwhile, Bartolo Colon 
has had a career year with 20 
wins. Expect Frankie Rodriguez 
to shut down the Bronx Bombers 
in the ninth while Mariano Rivera 
watches from the bullpen. I'll take 

the Angels in four. 
Red Sox vs, White Sox 

The White Sox have played 
horribly in September and are 
lucky to even make the playoffs 
with the way the Indians have been 
playing. However, [ do believe 
that the White Sox will be able to 
barely hold them off and will wind 
up playing the Red Sox in the first 
round. Facing the Red Sox is no 
easy task, as the Yankees learned 
last year, and the White Sox do 
not have the momentum needed 
to succeed in the playoffs. The 
Beantowners have a lineup like no 
other (except maybe the Yankees), 
but it will come down to their 
pitching. Pitching wins World 
Series. 1I0wever, J can't imagine 
Curt Schilling pulling any heroic 
antics this year 10 lead the Sox to 
victory. But, beacuse the Red Sox 
are still a bener team and will have 
more momentum than the White 
Sox coming into the series, they'll 
advance after four games. 

That is all the predictions I 
can pull out of my crystal baseball 
for now, so until the next edition 
of preposterous predictions, enjoy 
the MLB playoffs and expect an "I 
told you so" column next week if 
['m right.

,Soccer: Tritons win third straight game 
continued from page 16 

After Belak-Berger was sent 
off, the Broncos launched into an 
aggressive offensive push, which 
resulted in siJC corner lUcks and 
four legitimate offensive anacks 
in the final 35 minutes. 

"Ln the second half, we were 
able to push the Broncos, but we 
did not have lots of opportunities 
for scoring," sophomore Kathy 
Sepulveda said. 

Two of the Broncos' four 
shots were saved at the mouth 
of the UCSD goal by freshman 
goalie Mia Shirley, the only 
UCSD saves made during the 
evening. . 

Though the Broncos earned 
six second-half corner kicks, none 
of them were able to find the back 
of the net. The Triton defense 
greW' more assertive and fought 
hard against the offensive pushes 
of the Broncos in order to hold 
on to the lead. 

"In the first half we laid off 
with defense, but in the second 
half we really stepped up the 
pressure," McManus said. 

Furthermore, despite the fact 
that the Broncos had a notable 
8-1 edge in comer kicks for the 
game, they were unable to con-
vert any of them into a goal. 

J n addition, the Tritons topped 
Cal Poly Pomona in shots. The 

Broncos were on the short end of 
a 15-4 count for shots, but spent 
the large majority of the second 
half at UCSD's end. 

"It was a frantic game - Cal 
Poly Pomona played their 'A' 
game," junior Kelly Cochran 
said. 

The game turned into an 
intensely physical match on both 
sides of the field, as evidenced by 
the 32 fouls called and five cards 
assessed. 

"We stayed strong and every-
one played their hearts out," 
junior Heather Sugg said. 

With the loss, the Broncos 
fell to 2-6-1 overall and 1-2-1 in 
league action. 

Earlier in the week, the 
Tritons shut out No. 12 Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, 2-0, on the 
road, ending a two-game losing 
streak against the Toros dating 
back to last season. 

UCSD freshman Kelly Mayo 
notched her first goal of the sea-
son at just over four minutes into 
the ~ontest, taking a cross from 
junior Alise Malley and beating 
Toro goalkeeper Lisa Agramonte 
to the near post for a quick 1-0 
lead. 

The goal was the first of 
Mayo'S career, while Mailey'S 
assist was her sixth of the season. 

Seemingly shell-shocked, the 

Toros managed only five shots 
in the fi.rst 45 minutes, with most 
coming from long range. 

The Tritons took that 1-0 
lead into intermission and built 
on it early in the second half as 
junior Megan Dickey sent home 
a goal at the 48-minute mark of 
the match . 

Dickey, who entered the con-
test the league leader in points, 
took an unassisted rebound off a 
blocked shot and beat Agramonte 
for her eighth goal of the season. 

The Toros, who seemed a step 
slow all afternoon, put together 
valiant attempts at a comeback, 
but failed to put pressure on 
Shirley, who was bolstered by her 
team's assertive defense. 

Shirley notched her first 
career shutout with the win. She 
made seven saves in the Triton 
win, while Agramonte notched 
only two saves in the loss. 

The Tritons took two more 
shots on the night than did the 
Toros while attempting two less 
corner kicks. 

Both teams had one yellow 
card in the match while Cal State 
Dominguez Hills committed 12 
fouls to UCSD's nine. 

UCSD returns to action next 
week, traveling to Sonoma State 
on Sept. 30 and San Francisco 
State on OCt. 2.

into the tournament was just to go 
in ulere and win our four mal~h ­
es," I [arper said . 

Unfortunately, the game 
was marred when senior Clark 
Peterson went to block a ama 
Cruz backhand and broke two 
bones in hi right han<\. According 
to Ilarper, he is expected to be on 
the disabled list for 4-12 weeks. 

After the two-day tournament, 
the Tritons improved their overall 
record to 16-6, capping off their 
first four weeks of intensive play. 

Borso put up five goals for the 
Tritons in Sunday's games com-
bined, while Iloplcins also scored 
multiple goals in each game. 

Led by IJarper, the Tritons 
have enjoyed success as one of the 
top programs in the country. Last 
year, the Tritons gained valuable 
experience as a young team and 
lost only one senior this year. 

"This is a group of individu-
als that have been together for 
five years; basically, what it comes 
down to is that these are older 
guys that know what is expected of 
them," Harper said . 

Due 'to strategic team plan-
ning, the Tritons lost only one 
senior last year, Nick Cooper, and 
had redshirted players in order to 
improve the experience and skill-
level of the team by the players' 
senior year. 

The Tritons will host No. 8 
Long Beach State in their third 
consecutive weekend match on 
Oct. I at 6 p.m. 

The first time the two teams 
met at the Southern California 
Invitational, the Tritons pulled 
away with an 11 - 10 victory on 
Hopkins' game-winning goal that 
came with 23 seconds left in sud-
den death overtime. 

"Long Beach State is a a very 
good team, there were many criti-
cal plays that could have gone 
either way," Harper said. "Their 
coach will probably bring some-
thing new to the table that we'll 
have to prepare for. We were 
very appreciative of the turnout 
last Friday. Hopefully we can 
repeat that again for Saturday'S 
big ga'me."

Men's soccer: Tritons heading to NorCal 
continued from (Jage f 6 

with No.4 Cal State Dominguez 
Hills in Carson, Calif. 

Krupansky tied the game in the 
second half, which thrust the game 
into overtime, where neither team 
was able to score a game-winning 
goal to end the match. 

Before Krupanslcy's heroics, in 
the game's 18th minute, Cal State 
Dominguez Hills senior Francisco 
Corona was the beneficiary of a 
turnover, and was fouled inside the 
box after collecting the loose ball. 

Capitalizing on his penalty kick 
opportunity, Corona tapped the 
baJJ to the far post as Ruhland 
guessed incorrectly, diving to his 
right for naught. Corona's second 
goal of the year pushed the Toros 
to a 1-0 lead at just over the 18-
minute mark. 

After intermission, UCSD capi-
talized on an ea rly scoring oppor-
tunity. 

Krupansky sailed up the left 
sideline after taking a pass from 
Tannenhaus at the 46:30 mark, and 
lofted his shot into the upper inside 
corner of the far post, just over 
the outstretched arm of Cal State 
Dominguez Hills goalkeeper Kyle 
Polak, knotting the contest a t I- I. 

The Toros and Tritons played 
evenly in the first frame, with 
neither side giving an inch. Both 
defenses dominated and kept the 
match knotted at one goal apiece 
throughout the first overtime peri-
od. 

"We showed up with the imen-

" We showed up with the 
intensity to not be beat. 
This game shows that 
UCSD can compete 

, " agalnst most teams. 
- Derek AnnstronJ, 

men's soccer head cOach 

tion to not be beat," Armstrong 
said. "This game shows that UCSD 
can compete against most teams." 

The 65th minute saw the 
Tritons nearly lose the game, 3S 
the Toros had a golden opportu-
nity to regain the lead. 

Toro sophomores Sammy Rivas 
and Nick RippetO teamed up for a 

Like to 

two-on-one fast break. 
After Rivas had his initial shot 

blocked 10 yards from the goal, he 
collected the rebound and found 
Rippeto, who quiclcly rerumed the 
pass to Rivas' feet, who blasted it 
by Ruhland. 

The effort was called back, 
however, as the Toros were called 
offside , negating a momenrum-
changing play. 

The teams played two extra 
frames, with neither capitalizing on 
the other team's stingy defense. 

U Although it was a very hard 
game, everything went reasonably 
well," Armstrong said. 

The Toros out-shot the Tritons 
by a 17- 10 margin and had a 5-3 
advantage in corner kicks. 

UCSD was called for five less 
fouls in the match, while Cal State 
Dominguez Hills was whistled for 
12 infractions on the day. 

The tie gives UCSD a 1-0-1 
record on the year against top-five 
ranked teams as the Tritons posted 
a 2-0 win on Sept. lover then No, 
2 Seattle University. 

The Tritons return to CCAA 
play next week, traveling to 
Sonoma State on Sept. 30 and San 
Francisco State on Oct. 2.

The UCS () w()Jllen'~ soccer 
team took advantage of Cal Polr 
Pomona 's severe offensive woes on 
Sept. 24, hlanking the Broncos 1-0 
in a California Collegiate thleric 

ssociation home match. 
The No. 20 Triton, (7- 1 over-

all , 3-1 CC A) frustrated the 
Broncos with a single mOll1cntous 
goal that ca mc on a pen'l lty kick by 
freshman atasha Belak- Berge r in 
the 53rd minute of the second half 
of the game. 

Belak-Berger asserted herself in 
an exciting four-minute stretch in 
the second half, beginning .at the 
51 :07 mark when she was assessed 
a yellow card on a hard tack le. 

Only a few minutes later, Belak-
Berger was taken down inside the 
Cal Poly Pomona penalty area 
and awarded a penalty shot, which 
she carefu lly knocked into the left 
corner of the goal. 

The party was over for Belak-
Berger soon after her goal. After 
an attempt to slow down a Bronco 
penalty restart, Belak- Berger was 
carded again for an infraction. 

Belak- Berger found herself with 
two yellow card~ for the night, 
which automatically re,ulted in a 
red card and an ejection. 

The ejection came at the 54:45 
mark and left the Tritons with a 
player down for the remainder of 
the match.

UCSD wins big over 
two ranked opponents 

Tritons beat No. 20 UC Santa 
Cruz, No.8 Long Beach State 

By ANGELA LIN 
Associate Sports Editor 

On Sept. 25, the I o. 5 UCSD 
men 's w.lter polo team completed 
a tlawless performance at the 2005 
UC Santa Cruz Slugfest. The men 
po, ted a 4-0 tournament record 
with two big wins over o. H 
Long Beach State and No. 20 C 
Santa Cruz. 

The Tritons, led hy co-captains 
senior Brandon Borso and junior 
Joe \I\'oodri ng, started the match 
off strongly, scoring six goals in 
the first period , while a llowing the 
49crs only three goa ls. 

In the second qua rter, borh 
teams scored two goa ls apiece, 
hut after halftime the Tritons 
had renewed energy and netted 
three more goa ls to Long Beach 's 
two. In the fourth quarter, the 
4gers gave one last push, but were 
unable to cap the victory, and the 
Tritons walked away with a 12-10 
wm. 

'One of the key moments on 
a po itive note ]from the tOurna -
ment] , was when we came out anti 
outscored Long Beach ]Stare] in 
the first quarter with tremendous 
ourside shooting," head coach 
Denny Il arpcr sa id . " It was defi -
nitelya different way to beat them 
then the last time we played Lon g 
Beach where ]senior] Jonath an

remember last October viv-

idly - the seven-ga me nail -biter 
series, the walk-ofr home runs , 

Carlo~ Beltran's heroics and, of 
course, the mimcie BoSox come-
back - but it is now time to 
push tho~e memories a~ide to 
make room for tbe all - new 2005 
,\lajor League Baseball phlyo ffs. 
Some races arc yet to be decided 
and therefore the matchups for 
the playoff~ arc not set in stone. 
Ilowe\ er, I would like to use my 
comprehensive baseball knowl -
edge to enlighten the world to this 
year\ Division Series winners in 
my 2005 ,\1 LB playoff preview. 

Natiol1<ll League 
Division Series 

The I atiunal League has a 
clear playoff picture, with two 
clinched divisions and one on the 
way. The Ilou~tOn Astros have the 
wild-card slot almost wrapped up 
and, harring an autumn miracle, it 

~eem~ that the St. Louis Cardina ls 
will play the San Diego Padres 
and the \danta Braves will face 
the '\ ~I ro~ . 

Cardinals vs. Padres 
' 1 hi \ one'., a no-hrainer. The 

Patin: .. cou ld hecome the fir~t te,lIll

record .Ind the Cardinab could win

I he h.lt, of Pujol .. and Edmond., 
to complement their elite rnt.l-

tion , led hy 21 -game winner and 
Cy Young Award candidate Chris 
Carpenter. The Padres have a 
fighting chance if Peavy ca n match 
lip againH Carpenter in ga me one 
and take the lead in the series. I 
doubt that will happen , however, 
and give the Cardinals the win in 
the series in three games. 

Braves vs. Astros 
This one is a coin-flip. The 

Braves have now won 14 srraight 
L East titles, but for the first 

time this year, they accomplished 
it with a youth invasion. Andruw 
Jones' breakout year was long 
overdue and helped the te,lm beat 
ou t tough cOlllpeti tion in the I L 
East with the additional help of 
2 1-year-o ld Jeff Francoeur. The 
'S tros will ride Roger Clemens' 
bleach-blond highlights and 1.!l9 
ERA, coup led with Roy Oswalt's 
19 wins, to a second-straight wild-
card finish. T his series will be 

c1o~e, but the Baby Br<wes lack the 
playoff experience they used to 
rely on and do not have the pitch-
ing that the tros hring to the 
tahle. Look for the Astros to upset 
in five games. 

American Leagu e 
Divis ion Series 

Before I begin this AL playoff 
preview, I must announce that 
three playoff spots are still up in 
the air in the AL and therefore 
I can not guarantee the match-
up~ for the two divi~ion series. 
For this preview, I am assuming 
the following: the Chicago White 
Sox will hold off the Indians and 
take the A L Central title . Iso, 
the Yankees will take two our of
