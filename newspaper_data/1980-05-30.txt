Only 50 Stay for Guild Speaker

Several hundred quiet 
students were all who showed 
up for yesterday's San Diego 
Students for Peace "resistance 
and education" anti-
registration rally on Revelle 
Plaza. 

Aside from a core group of 
about 50, few people stayed in 
the midday sun to listen to the 
eight speakers lecture on 
topics ranging from how to 
undermine the draft 
registration process to how the 
mass media is misrepresenting 
the anti-war movement and 
encouraging an atmosphere of 
blind patriotism. 

The featured speaker of the 

rally was Kathy Gilbert, from 
the National Lawyers' Guild, a 
group which has pledged its 
support to counsel those who 
refuse to register for the draft. 

"We face a deadly threat of 
a draft and we face it very 
soon. Our very lives are at 
stake," she said. 

She al 0 charged that the 
draft has been and remains a 
process "with racist and class 
bias. " 

"The Selective Service 
exploits the lower classes and 
minority groups," she said, 
drawing the loudest applause 
of the afternoon. 

She further explained that 
men born in 1960 and 1961 
would most likely be required 

erratum 
It was reported in yesterday's Daily Guardian that AS 

councilwoman Pam Gerber "argued that Student Affirmative 
Action Committee representative would merely be a token 
(on the Student Center Board) and should remain a non-
voting member. " Due to an editing error, what Gerber 
actually said, that the 5AAC and Co-ops and Enterprises 
representatives to the-SCB, two new voting positions on the 
Board approved by the AS last night, "could adequately 
represent their interests as e~-officio (non-voting) members," 
was garbled. ...

Editor: 
Th. letter i. in behalf of the UCSD 

Black Student Union, in regard to the 
Registration Fee Committee's recent 
recommendation fo replace the full·time 
legal aid coordinator, Nick Aguilar, 
with student interns from USD. 

We feel that student legal services 
would decline disproportionately if the 
recommendation were to be 
implemented. Student. would no longer 
be provided the capable and necessary 
legal assistance offered by a full·time 
,qualified lawyer like Nick Aguilar.

Editor: 

I would like to say that I found the 
visit of John Anderson's children to 
UCSD most useful in helping me to 
decide to support Anderson for 
President. 

Therefore, we are in strong support 
of MEChA's current stance and 
grie¥ances against the proposed 
recommendation of the Reg Fee 
Committee to restructure student legal 
aid. 

Proposition 9 Backed" 

On the issues, I learned that 
Anderson favors an increase in our 
conventional arms (although how he 
would achieve it by cutting $30 billion 
out of the defense budget was left 
unclear). I also found that Anderson 
was going to raise revenue by a 50 cent 
tax on a gallon of gas, but this would be 
balanced by a 50 percent reduction in 
social security taxes (althoulP how this 
would benefit students, the poQr and the 
elderly who pay little or QO social 
security taxes was also left unclear). I 
also learned that the Trilateral 
Commission was only a "social group" 
which has "no impact upon the policies 
of the US government" (after all, 
everyone knows that the heads of big 
multinational corporations have no 
effec t upon this country 's policies).

housing crisis facing Cape 
Town's Blacks is so ' severe 
that more than AOO,OOO 
people are in need of adequate 
places to live. 

Most of them are now 
among an estimated 250,000 
" squatters" who live in 
homemade shac ks of 
corrugated sheet metal , 
forming illegal camps with 
populations up to 40,000. 

The official response to 
these communities has been 
straightforward and nearly 
uniform: squatter camps are 
r eg ularly lev e led by 
bulldozers. Women and 
children are forcibly deported 
to the homelands, or they 
scatter into the bush with their 
belongings , where many 
tenaciously gather to rebuild 
their communities. 

For three years, Livonia 
Mandela and her five children 
lived in the bush, sheltered 
only by a piece of plastic . 
Then, in 1975, she built a 
shanty in the squatter 
community of Modderdam, 
n ear' Cap e Tow n , a 
community which was to be 
destroyed three years later. 

"The police didn't warn us," 
she.told me. "They came very 
early with dogs and tear gas, 
and the bulldozers began 
breaking everything." She and 
her children fled to a church at 
four that morning, leaving by 
daylight to go back into 'the 
bush. Once again the family 
lived under a plastic tarp, 
which was soon ripped apart 
by an inspector. 

The family then built 
another shanty, this time in a 
squatter community called 
Unibel. They had lived there 
just silt months when the police 
came once more to level the 
community. One of her 
children was only a month old, 

but she managed to do what 
she had done before, when 
Modderdam was bulldozed: 
she buried her furniture. There 
was no other safe place to put 
it. A month later, she and 
some friends would come in 
the middle of . the night to 
recover it. 

S quatter communities. like Modderdam and Unibel are not simply 
defiant violations of apartheid 
laws. They are attempts to 
satisfy pressing needs for 
shelter , stable family life , and a 
minimum of economic security 
against the odds of massive 
legal barriers. 

Permanent Black commu· 
nities located near "White" 
cities are considered a ' threat, 
and one of the measures the 
government has employed in 
attempting to destabilize and 
slow their growth is restricting 
the availability of family 
housing. Following an official 
policy decision in the late '60s, 
construction of Black family 
housing in White areas 
dropped , increasing over· 
crowding and lengthening the 
waiting lists . In the Cape Town. 
area , a virtual moratorium on 
construction of homes for 
Blacks began in 1966, and 
eased only recently. 

But the jobs are in the 
"White" cities, and the use of 
Black labor is essential to the 
White economy. Thus, Black 
men are allowed into White 
areas, not as permanent 
settlers, but as migrant 
laborers with one year 
contracts, required to live 
without their famil~s in dreary 
single·sex ho~tala. They may 
work for 40 years in the same 
area, renewing their contract. 
every year, and atill be 

'd' d " con .. ere temporary 
. sojournera" while their wives 

are "superfluous appendages" 
who must remain in the 
homelands. 

The homelands, which 
comprise about 13 percent of 
South Africa's land area , are 
impoverished , tribal reserva· 
tions populated mostly by 
women and children or the 
aged and infirm left behind by 
able·bodied workers. 

I n Cape Town, 60 per· cent of the Black men 
live in single sex hos· 

tels. In Langa, a nearby 
African township, the low 
brick barracks of one such 
compound strip a barren and 
dusty plot of ground. The 
quarters are dark, with the 
damp cement chill of a 
basement, and they smeil of 
sour beer. The cliffs of Table 
Mountain and neighboring 
peaks form a grand and harsh 
background to these strange 
homes where six workers 
share one room, furnished 
only with cement slabs for 
beds. Some wives and children 
are present - illegally - and 
consequently in corttinual fear 
of arrest, fines and deportation 
back to the homelands . 

"Migrant labor and a jail 
term as far as our conditiqns 
are concerned, are not very 
different - for even in our 
residences we can hardly sleep 
because, of the relentless raids 
by the ,EOlice," one worker 
said. "The day you are 
fortunate enough to get a 
contract, your life as a convict 
has begun ." 

M ore than one million families are split by the migrant labor sys· 
tern, involving nearly a third of 
South Africa's total Blac:k 
population. In the Cape 
Peninsula, the situation is 
particularly difficult for those

Carter Clears Sale 
Of Arll1S to China 
W ASHINCTON - In a 

hiatoric move, the Carter 
administration yesterday 
cleared the way ' for the first 
sale. of mili tary. rei a ted 
equipment and technology to 
the communist government of 
China. 

Def~nse Secretary Harold 
Brown made the announce. 

. ment after extensive talks with 
Chinese Vice Premier Geng 
Biao. Brown said the US 
govrnment had approved 
export license applications for 
a wide range of equipment 
such as air defense radar, 
helicopters and communica. 
tions gear, and the sale of 
computers. 

Brown and Geng stressed 
that the actions are significant 
in what they described as a 
"step.by.step relationship" 
between the two superpowers, 
which once were enemies on 
the Korean battlefield. 

Brown emphasized the 
moves did not represent the 
beginning of a formal alliance 
between the countries , 

although he said "the People's 
Republic of China and the 
United States are friends." 

He noted the landmark 
approvals do not involve the 
sale of weapons or anna. 
Other defense officials, 
speaking anonymously, said 
such sales are not under 
consideration. 

But Geng, speaking 
through an interpreter, seemed 
to imply China may later ask 
to buy American weaponry. 

"I don't think there is such a 
possibility. at present, but I 
believe there may be such a 
possibility in the future ," Geng 
said. 

There was an atmosphere 
of warmth and cordiality as the 
two defense leaders faced 
reporters after about two hours 
of wind·up talks climaxing 
Geng's visit to Washington. 

Gens, the highest ranking 
Chinese defense official to visit 
the United States, has 
conferred with President

Shot, Injured 

FORT WAYNE, Ind. -
Vernon E. Jordan, Jr., 
president of the National 
Urban League, was seriously 
wounded by a sniper armed 
with a rifle early yesterday as 
he returned to his motel in a 
car driven by a civil rights

the ambush by a gunman lying

yesterday, pavng the way for

BH: I don't do a lot of 
acting; I do acting a4 a kind of 
pleasure, I don't do it for a 
living. I do it ismply to 
accomodate a kind of 
hangover from a long time ago 
when I was an actor for a 
while. And it gives me a kind 
of pleasure that the other 
things don't. I mostly do other 
things for a living, arrd its just a 
kind of avocation for rile. 

DG: So you do acting 
mostly for pleasure? Is that 
what you're saying? ' 

BH: Yeah, I don't do a lot of 
acting. I appear now and then 
in films friends of mine make, 
and I do Saturday Night Live. 
I've been doing that show 
since it started a couple of 
thousand years ago. 

DG: In the roles I've seen 
you play you've always played 
sort of a real ordinary guy, a 
clerk·type person. Is this by 
choice, or are the parts written 
for you that yvay? 

BH: Who are these 
ordinary, clerk-type people? 

DG: Well, for instance, in 
Heaven Can Wait, you played 
the clerk-type angel. 

BH: Well , I don't know to 
answer that. I was hired as the 
co-director of the film. Which 
is what I was there mostly for, 
and I've acted in a ' lot of the 
films I've written, almost 
always by accident. In this 
case it seems that there was a 
part that I could reasonably 
play. There is no interesting 
answer to the question. I wish 

, there were. They haven't all 
been clerk-types, but you' re 
right, some of them have . One 
is limited to an extent by 
certain physical accidents. I 
mean I'm not going to playa 
weight lifter and I'm not likely 
to be in competition for the 
same part Warren Beaty is 
going to play. And since I'm 
not in the acting market 
looking for joba, a lot of people 
forget that I do acting. I do 
tum down five or six parts a 
year in films that I know aren't 
going to be very good, or vesy 
interesting, or because I'm 
doing something else I'd rather 
do. I'm not terribly interested 
in acting in films anymore, 
unless its very interesting 
directing. 

DG: Any special reasons? 
BH: No, I don't have a 

dislike for it. I do something 
else for a living, and it takes a 
lot of time. I write scripts for a 
tiving, or I direct films . And 
what I do on the other things is 
just a passing glllJl:e.

British Tide in A:, 
New Wave Is Just-Rock 'n 

Little popular music' has 
attracted as much attention in 
the past decade as New Wave, 
which is rapidly expanding its 
influence from its precocious 
puck·rock roots in the mid-
seventies. 

There are obvious and 
undeniab le similarities 
between the contemporary 
form and the R&B, rock 'n 
roll-influenced British invasion 
0/ the mid-sixties, both in 
terms of the song-composition 
and public image which New 
Wave artists are attempting to 
project. 

"It was the disco movement 
which did more to add to the 
confusion than any thing else," 
says one former Capri corn 
Records artist-and-repetoire 
man. "The music industry 
didn't catch onto disco until it 
had crept up and taken over on 
the charts." 

With the "death of disco", 
the conf usion ,s pread , 
especially in the States, where 
recor d companies were 
un familiar with such 
performers as Johnny Rotten 
or the Clash, who were 
conquering the British Isles ' 
with their raw, unpolished 
music. 

"The ' Englilh lubsidiaries 

were more willing to take a 
chance with the punk-rockers, 
since they contract for fewer

England was a test market for 
the American companies. 

"Polydor, especial ly , went 
'bananas ' and began signing 
everybody in sight. In one 
month alone, they released 15 
New Wave albums. CBS, on 
the other hand, saw that Clash 
and Angel City were selling 
big regionally, and finally 
released their albums through 
Epic in the States. T hey're 
cleaning up ," he says. 

In fact, tbe rush. to sign 
American New Wave bands 
was characterized by 
confu sion. 

"In '78, nobody was doing a 
good job of predicting m arket 
trends ," he says. "When we 
finally picked up the disco 
thing, it was on its way out. 
We were panicking. Then, 
especially on the West Coast, 
but simultaneously in the 
densely -populate d urban 
centers, the punk thing was

"Sure, we have A&R men 
in the field all the time looking 
Jor new talent. But there was a 
period , especially in 
Hollywood, when all there was 
to hear was New Wave. Every 
club, concert, showcase (a 
formal presentation of a 
band's original material for 
record company people) -
you name it - was New 
Wave. A&R men got their 
instructions that · this could be

enough about the music to 
judge the quality."

And indeed, it appeared 
that the higher echelon was 
right. Record companies saw 
how much money Elvis 
Costello was bringing in for 
CBS/Columbia , saw the 
faddism centering around the 
New Wavers , and decided 
that this was the promised 

land. But for how long? 
Says the former Capricorn 

man, "Well , about the time 
that the rush to sign was on, 
New Wave was mellowing out 
from its punk roots. There 
seemed to be two lines of 
demarcation involved, 
between the basic punkers, the 
British Inv as ion 60 's 
copycats, and what has 
evolved into power por'" 

An example 0 this 
metamorpho s is is the 
Pretenders, who this week 
hold the number 14 spot on the 
Billboard top 1 00 singles 

chart, and have their 
American debut album firmly 
ensconsed in the top fifteen. 

Stan Pachter, a long-time 
musicologist and professional 
musician notes, "When I 
heard one of the old 
Pretenders' British releases, it 
was crude, Oawed and rasty, in 
that it is a far cry from 'I'm 
precious, so fuck you' to 'I'm 
special ... got to have some of 
your attention _'" 

The record company 
problem has been that each 
expected that the New Wave 
movement would gain 

momentum like the early 
British invasion as a social 
phenomenon replete with fads 
like dress, speech and 
behavior. 

"This hasn't materialized," 
says Pachter. "The record 
sales are good, but they aren't 
all the rage disco was. This 
was what was hoped for . No 
one is doing a very good job of 
predicting what is going to 
happen next."

"Roughly 40 to 50 percent 
of the regional and local acts

Amold points out that many 

former progressive rock and 
mainstream rocks are hopping 
onto the bandwagon. "It • like 
the 'old .chool' believed that 
studio excellence came before

Wavers are .aying is that 
emotion and message are 
more important than the 

t~cal aspects of music. If I 
see a band live or listen to them 
Oft record, I want to be 
moved," he says. 

Arnold ajrees with the 
current belief that the New 
Wave movement i. primarily 
an urban phenomenon. "It 
began with a radical 
disenchantment over the state 
of affairs of the world - the 
same sort of alienation which 
sparked the acid rock in San 
Francisco in the late sixties," 
he aa3'l. 1he primary urban 
centers were Detroit, LA and 
New York, and the sound was 
influenced by early Nugent, 
Seed. and Standens. "In this 
respect, it is like a resurgence 
of the old Motor City sound," 
Amold says. 

New Wave has evolved 
from its punk roots into a more 
refined, sophisticated formata, 
owing to the influx of 
sophisticated production 8Jld 
slick songwriting into the 

~nre. Arnold believes that 
'there ill a definite shift to what 

we call 'power pop'," and that 
"the next trend might be 
towards a technology-
influenced venue, like what 
Garr, Neumann is putting 
out. 

Arnold sees no let.up in the 
local sense, and points to the 

mounting popularity of local 
groups like the Rick fJias 
Band, Fingen , and the 
Penetrators, in terms of their 
ability to draw crowds to 
locally-produced shows. 

Popular music , by 
definition, appeals to a wide 
cross· section of the buying 
public. The consumer has little 
interest other than to be 
entertained, and is not 
particularly concerned about 
the musicianship, material or 
originality of the artist. 

As a result many overlook 
the obvious similarities 
between the new 'power pop' 
and its precursive influences 
(Beatles j early Who, Stones, 
Sam and Dave, and the 
Detroit Scene of the sixties). 

Pachter points out, "Take 
Angel City, who are being 
plugged heavily by Epic. 1heir 
stuff is just good, straight-
forward rock·n' roll, 
indistinguishable for the most 
part from any other you've 
heard. There is not one 
particular outstanding 
musician, and this is one trend 
I have noticed recently. It's 
getting back to the synergy of 
the unit, especially with 
respect to live performances." 

In a recent San Diego 
appearance of Angel City at 
the Roxy, the after-concert 
mood was one of business-as-
usual. The band played before 
a moderate-sized enthusiastic 
crowd. "Sure, we're riding the 

crest of New Wave," says 
drummer Graham "Buzz" 
Bidstrup. " But we're not 
looking to market ourselves a 
a New Wave act. We're all 
rock n' rollers." 

The band has been billed as 
"the only band ever invited to 
tour with David Bowie," and 
has a rapidly-dimbin~ album 
on the national charts, but has 
yet to achieve a breakthrough 
analogous to Costello, the 
Pretenders or the Cars. 

"I don't have any particular 
opinion on New Wave. It's just 
another form of music," he 
says. "If they want to lump us 
with that type of music, that's 
OK. We're concerned about · 
ourselves and what we're 
doing, not with what someone 
else is doing." 

Similar views are expressed 
by Wally Palmar_ and Jimmy 
Marinos of the Romantics, a 
CBS entry which was highly. 
touted and perhaps over-
hyped by the company. A 
Detroit-based group, they site 
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit 
heavies as their main 
influences. 
. "We don't look at what 

we're doing as really being a 
part of the new wave thing," 
insists Marinos , although he 
concedes that the image the 
band has used (matching 
leather suits in a sickening red, 
Beatie haircuts and pointed 
shoes) is deceptive to this 
argument. "We've played all 
kinds of music. Our influence 
comes from the kind of stuff we 
like to listen to. If we sound like 
we're a page out of the sixties, 
then that's fine with us." 
. Palmar points out that the 
New Wave movement has 
helped their concert 
popularity. "It just happened 
that what we've been doing for 
years is r:IO popular," he 
says. 

The band admits that their 
debut release lacks the power 
and excitement that their stage 
show generates. "We are a 
concert band, no doubt about 
it. Our debut album was 
disappointing to us, because it 
didn't project this," he notes. 

Slouching Towards 
New West 

BY MARCIA BRISBOIS 
Nadine bought the cardboard box at exactly 7:16 pm. She 

knew it was exactly 7: 16 because her Dior quartzite watch said 
so. Dallas had given her the watch for their sixth wedding 
anniversary. When he used to love her. Before the cat died. Oh 
,well. She wouldn't think about that. Her cat. 

They hadn' t wanted to tell her about the cat. Her mother called 
that morning. "Your father wants to talk to you," she said. 

"Oh," said Nadine. She'd already begun to think about the 
cookie house. 

"Your father has never understood," said her mother. "But you 
don't care either. " 

Her father 's voice came through the line. 

Marcia Brisbois is a graduate student in English literature. She 
is convinced that the only person who would build an elaborate 
cookie house is the central character in a Joan Didion nouel. 

One small package pink party mints shaved on one ~ide to 
make them flat. Did Dallas leave his razor? 

"Nadine," her father said, "it's your cat." 
She was still looking at the picture. Windows: six scalloped 

rectangular tea cookies (21/4 x 1 W') decorated with icing. 
"Nadine, are you there?" 
Where would she get the tea cookies? Doors: two long fig bars 

(3 5/8 x 1 W') available at soda fountains. The Sugar Shack, she 
thought. Hot summer time. Knees pressed against cool marble. 
"Two small yellow gumdrops for door handles," she said and 
hung up. 

Dallas came home. He looked at her. "Baby you need a drink. 
Your cat is dead. Get dressed. We've got to go to a fundraiaer." 

She never remembered how long she had screamed. She must 
have stopped eventually, because there were new checked 
curtains in the kitchen and she was looking at the cookie box. She 
was going to build the cookie house on page 64. And she had the 
box. The cardboard box that she was going to cover with exactly 
twelve kinds of cookies, three varieties of candy. With sugar 
cement walls. And a chocolate cat like in the picture. A chocolate 
cat.

TV Show Libels Profs 
Sex Wins Out 
Over Veracity 

BY PETER MORTENSEN 
St.ff Wriw 

The scene on the television screen 
shows a voluptuous young woman 
removing her garments, preparing to 
hop in bed with a middle-aged 
gentleman with too much hair on his 
chest. 

True, this is something you might 
expect to see on commercial television 
these days, but the surprise is, this is a 
scene from a recent "docudrama" on 
recombinant-DNA-

The Henderson Mon ster, (CBS, 
Tuesday, 9 pm) promised to deal with 
the current controversy of the alteration 
of life in the laboratory. In reality, the 
show's scientific unintelligibility kept the 
plot out of the lab and confined to the 
bedroom. 

From a layman's perspective, it is 
easy to say that The Henderson Monster 
was network television at its worst; the 
acting was mediocre and the storyline 
slow, disjointed and diched. 

But one must heavily weigh the 
opinion of a scientist whose work the sow 
show tried to portray. 

And he says "they just blew it .. .!t

ry Gales. (2 hr.) 

wasn't even entertaining." 
Melvin Simon, a UCSD biology 

professor, who is himself involved with 
laboratory recombinant·DNA, was 
unimpressed by the show. "I watched 
the first ten minutes and it became 
obvious it was a script from· an old 
Wonder Woman movie or something," 
he says. 

"They got the 100 most-used words 
by molecular bioligists sprinkled into the 
first few minutes," he noted. That flaw 
was definitely a foreshadowing of the 
remaining portion of the show. 

"Hollywood has done this number on 

the scientists for years," Simon said, 
commenting on the quality of the script. 
"It is a real interesting issue that could 
have been brought up very nicely, but 
instead they did a real job on it." 

"I watched an hour of the Nova 
program (PBS) on lasers which was 
absolutely fascinating," Simon said. He 
feels that a more practical and leas 
"Hollywood" program would have been 
more appealing to the general public. 

"I think anyone would realise the 
charicature of scientists there," he said. 
"I'm convinced no one watched that 
show because it was so stupid." 

The Henderson Monster, aside from 
having the obvious problems of weak 
scripts, stereotyped each of ill 
characters with demoralizing accuracy. 

There was the old man scientist on the 
verge of going to the big lab in the, lky 
(Nehemiah Persoff), the pig-headed, 
rude, arrogant, sexist, racist, otherwise 
unlikeable Nobel-prize winning scientisf 
(Jason Miller), the beautiful, seductive 
and slightly dinghy lab assistant 
(Christine Lahti) and her drunk, science-
fiction writing husband (Stephen Collins 
from Star Trek) . 

At times, Ernest Kinoy's dialogue did 
pick up, as was the case during several 
sharp exchanges between the scientist 
and the drunk writer, but the abysmal 
gaps between these barbs were almost 
unbearable. 

OG: And then if you 
mention The Graduate or 
Catch 22, they say ... 

BH: Who cares? 
DG: ... that he ' s a 

somebody. 
BH: Oh. A television series, 

a half hour television series is 
just what it is: an amusement. I 
don't think there's any reason 
to give it any more worth than 

it deserves. It had an 
interesting moment in its time. 
It was the first popular show on 
television that made fun of 
what were then somewhat 
sacred institutions: the FBI, 
the CIA, and the government 
in general. And even to a 
certain extent, attitudes about 
war; more generally about 
violence and institutionalized 

violence. But I would be hard 
put to muster a heavy 
argument for it as a major 
cultural institution . It was an 
amusement, and that's what it 
was intended to be: a satire. 
And once in a while we got 
lucky and were able to 
possibly instill in countless 
childrens' minds a sense of 
skepticism about some of the 

things that their mothers and 
fathers held a little more 
sacred than they were going 
to. 

OG: Are you satisfied with 
your achievements so far in 
TV, and acting and movies? 

BH: I don't know anyone 
who 's satisfied. Everyone 
would like to do a little more, a

Softball Title Races Get Underway Soon 
Six Intramural Leagues 
Begin Playoffs Sunday 

BY BARBARA HAAS 
Sport. Editor 

The Intramural Softball program 
begins its playoff season Sunday, 
with the largest number of teams in 
the history of UCSD scheduled to 
corflpete. 

Of the six different leagues, only 
two have a clear-cut favorite . The 
games are supposed to end June 8, 
although competition will continue 
through the week. 

In Men's AAA, one of only two 
leagues that are using double 
elimination format, No Nukes has to 
be considered the favorite. They won 
the AAA winter quarter 
championship, and at 7-0 for the 
season they should easily annihilate 
the competition. Some second-year 
medical students, coagulating under 
the name of Longballers, aim to 
provide some opposition, and TDH 
& Co. at 5·2 might also prove tough. 

One of the tightest leagues is Men's 
AA, since the presence of so many 
teams have forced the use of the 
single. elimination format. Winfield's 
Revenge, the number two seed, is a 
good pick, but will have to beat the 

heat put out by Too Cool if they're to 
win the crown. Both teams are at 7-0. 
The darkhorse in this race, and the 
favorite of the Czar in the Intramural 
office, is 86 who played to a 5-2 
record this season. 

Shadow Prices in Men's A stands 
out of the entire program as having 
the easiest time in the playoffs. 1be 
economic students have a 7-0 mark, 
and if they don't suffer from inflated 
confidence should breeze by In the 
Hole and Ice Man of GA, the only 
possible chaUengers. 

The Women's league is the only 
other division small enough to use 
double elimination. "There's been 
some good competition this year. 
There were enough teams to make 
two full leagues," said Scott Berndes 
of the 1M office. Butts To You and 
Pep Girls, both won with 6-1 records, 
are favored, although Oldies and 
Moldies at 5-1 might have a chance., 

The two coed leagues are the 
largest ever. Coed A is of gigantic 
proportions, and 37 of 72 teams are 
going to post season play. Kroc's 
Kids, Sliding Draebues and Flash and 
Co. all ha ve a chance

Iran Debate Brings 
Fire to Prof's Eyes 

BY LARRY FINKEL 
EmOtiOIll ran high last night 

during a two-hour faculty 
dilcuaaion of US foreign policy 
and ib effect on the Iranian. 
crisis_ 

The participanb in the 
discuslion sponlored by the 
Auociated Studenb included: 
Prof, James Kurth who lpoke 
on "Sacrificing Long-Range 
US Interesb," Prof. Jean 
Smith, speaking on "The 
Dead Letter of the War 
Powers Act" and Ambas-
sador Frank Maeltrone, who 
spoke on the government's 
responle to the Iranian crilis 
and hil experience as US 
counsel to Iran in the 1960's. 

The discussion began with 
Prof. Kurth comparing the 
capture of US hostages by the 
Iranians with the Revolution-
ary Government in China 
taking hostages at the US 
Embaasy in 1949, He 
preceded to outline how this 
caused hostility between 
China and the US at first , bet 
that after a 30-year cold war 
we are now finally dealing with 
each other with some degree of 
cooperation . He then 
suggested that the same may 
happen in Iran, 

Ambassador Maestrone 
chided Kurth for his "excellent 
exercise in hindsight." Adding 
the decisions now are never 
made in the same context in 
which they will later be 
studied, 

Ma e st ron e ci te d th e 
difficulty the US faces because 
the foreign policy establish-
ment can' t penatrate "the 14th 
Century skulls of some of"the 
clergy" in Iran. 

While Maestrone was 
making his remarks several 
members of the audience 
began hissing and booing, 

One of the few points on 
which Maestrone and Kurth 
agreed related to the futility of 
trying to aid any secession 
movements in Iran , Both 
agreed that this would place 
Iran in the hands of the 
Sov ie ts _ However , the 
problem now is trying to 
communicate with what little 
formal government there il in 
Iran, 

Kurth noted that the 
hostagel were taken on Nov , 
4, 1979 and that the 
presidential election will fallon 
Nov. 4, 1980, Kurth lees little 
likelihood that the ho.tages 
will be released in the near 
future becaule their political 
value will increase 'as this 
country get. cloler to the 
presidential election, 

Kurth compared the 
aborted US rescue attempt in 
Iran with President Ford's 
rescue of the Mayagues while 
that ship was held by the 
Cam bodian government. 
More people were lost during 
the resuce of the Mayagues 
then were saved. However, 
President Ford's effort · was 
regarded by the public as a 
success, Kurth added. 

Kurth said further that the 
rcublic tends to beli~ve that, 

Dead or alive, at least the 
hostages won 't still be in the 
embassy_ " Kurth sees 
economic elites as controlling 
much of the direction of US 
foreign policy_ 

Maestrone and Kurth 
agreed that the US actually 
supported the Shah because of 
our ' dependence on wha t 
Maestrone termed the "life 
blood," oil. 

"The Shah was democra ti· 
cally elected as much as any 
leader in that area is 
democra tically elected." In the 
1950 's the Iranians were 
la rge ly ill ite rat e a n d 
uneducated and didn't really 
unde r st a nd d e m ocracy , 
Maestron asserted. 

Prof. Smith sees the aborted 
resuce attempt as a "flagrant 
violation of the War Powers 
Act." This is just one more 
addition to the Imperial 
presidency, he added. 

) n e W ar Powers Act, 
approved near the end of the 
Nixon presidency, requires 
consultation with .Congress 
before any military manuever , 

"The presidency is gaining 
a total control over foreign 
affairs equal to that of any 
17th century monarch. The 
only difference that the office 
is not hereditary," Smith laid , 

C've Bargaining 
Conlinued from palle 1 
of confidentiality that apply to the other negotiators , 

"The law does not spell out, however, who can represent the 
studenb (graduate, undergraduate or both), when the 
representatives can comment, (begiMing, middle, or end of 
lession) , which negotiations they can participate in (academici 
al well as non-academicl), or what terms of confidentiality will 
bind all participants," Rogers said, 

According to UC Systemwide Collective Bargaining 
Coordinator tom Mannix, "No one in the Univerlity sees the 
students as negotiators - participants) yes, But students will not 
be bargaining, I personally believe students do not belong at the 
bargaining table. I believe this is a bilateral process," 

He added that students' rights will be protected, 
According to Jim Tamm, regional Director for PERB, there 

a re currently no specific methods of enforcing students' rights in 
general. If students feel their rights are being violated , they must 
file a suit in civa court or a petition with PERB. Both alternatives 
will take time, T amm noted, 

Students have already been excluded from the hearings which 
are determining the bargaining units - whether the campus 
police, dormitory custodianl and cafeteria workers , for example 
will be r~presented on individual campuses or systemwide QIlly. 

Once' bargaining begins students will not have the same 
opportunities available to employeel or employers to protes t 
unfair practices to PERB. If students feel they are being 
di llCriminated against, they mUlt rely on finding a sympathetic 
employee or the employer to file a suit on their behalf.

DG: But certainly you're 
not ashamed of anything 
you've done so far ? 

BH: Oh there's things I've 
done tha t I wish I hadn't. I've 
done a lot of films that weren' t 
very good, and I wish they 
were better, But you know that 
going in , and there are a 
couple of pictures that I wish I 
hadn't written, and a couple of 
pictures tha t I wish I hadn' t 
been in, I would have rather 
done some thin, else that was 
better, but that s a1 wavs tru P. . 

DG: H a ve things really 
changed on this campus, since 
when you were on college 
campuses? 

BH: Its really hard for me to 
tell; live only been here a few 
hours, but I think its probably 
much less structured, 

DG: Do you have anything 
to say, or comments to make 
about just anything? 

BH: I think students, like 
other people, should be careful . 
not to murder their parents, or 
at I as t not both of them.

Continued from poge I 

Both McElroy and 
Herbenar said that Ledden 
had consulted with Atkinson 
and Darling over the a sistant 
to the chancellor position I and 
recommended that it be 
abolished . Ledden would not 
comment on the decision . 

Geraldine Mele, Herbenar's 
attorney, called the layoff 
de cis ion " pre- emptory, " 
explaining that _ "there · has 
really been no evaluation of 
the needs of the chancellors' 
o ff ice." 

She argued that Herbenar's 
12-year work record a t UCSD 
has been excelle nt and 
"speaks for itself. " While 
McFJroy agreed, he specu-
la ted that her abi lities were not 
the reason for Atkinson's 
decision. 

In accordance wi th 
u n iversity reg ul a t ions, 
Herbenar and Ne le met 
yesterday with McElroy, UC 
General Counse l Dave 
Dorensen and A merican 
Federation of State, County 
a nd Munici pal Employees 
Steward Jim Stroml ky, But, 
" they didn't want to do 
a nything," Herbenar said. 

Herbenar said..she will "go 
all the way" in her grievance, 
which will probably not be 
settled for several months,

"Our children never know 
their fathers, and we as women 
take the wrong way just 
beca use we mis s our

African woman, "Aa a wife, 
you have no rights, 'They send 
you to the country and the

That is divorce, " Faced with
