UC campuses begin alcohol initiatives 
I 

UCSD not included in programs' grant funding 
By EIIIA CEIVANIES 

Staff Writer 
A $6.9 millioo grant awarded by 

the National Institute on Alcohol 
Abuse and Alcoholism to the UC 
Berlc.eley Prevention Research 
Center is being used at various 
UC schools for alcohol awareness 
programs. 

The intercampus program 
began in 2003, when health ser-
vices directors for the UC sys': 
tern resolved to pursue a proj-
ect on alcohol prevention, PRC 
Senior Research Scientist Robert 
F. Saltz said. The original design 
of the program involved all eight 
undergraduate campuses and was 
expanded to include six California 
State University campuses. 

The five-year program involves 
DC Davis, UC Berlc.eley, UC Santa 
Cruz and DC Riverside as what 
Saltz calls "intervention sites," 
where funds have been allocated 
to implement alcohol-awareness 
and -prevention strategies. The 
other four undergraduate campus-

es - UCLA, DC Santa Barbara, 
UC Irvine and UCSD - serve as 
"comparison sites" to gauge the 
program's effects, according to 
Saltz. 

Through annual surveys, 
researchers have learned that 
across the board, most alcohol-
related problems occur outside of 
campus borders. 

"In most all the cases, incidents 
of student drinlc.ing were related 
to off-campus parties, especially 
Greelc. houses, which we consider 
to be off campus," Saltz said. 

To address the problem, inter-
ventions launched at Berkeley, 
Davis and Santa Cruz in the past 
year involved measures to help 
prevent injuries, assaults and drunk 
driving associated with off-campus 
parties. Riverside has postponed its 
involvement in the program. 

According to Saltz, the imple-
mented measures came from 
the NIAAA5 lask Force Report, 
titled "A Call to Action: Changing 
the Culture of Drinlcing at U.S. 
Colleges." 

"The data showed that the envi-
ronment in which high-risk drink-
ing led to the greatest nwnber 
of negative consequences for stu-
dents, such as alcohol poisoning, 
assaults [and) property damage, 
was off-campus parties at houses 
and apartments," UC Davis Health 
Promotion Supervisor Michelle 
Johnston said. 

UC Davis implemented a "Safe 
Party Campaign," which focuses 
on responsible party hosting, poLice 
patrolJjng for parties and publicity 
for ordinances and laws relating to 
dri nlc.ing. 

"The goal of the safe-party ini-
tiative is to reduce problems by 
creating safer party environments 
and by building a closer sense of 
community between students and 
nonstudent neighbors," Johnston 
said. "We hope to reduce high-
risk drinlcing, lower negative con-
sequences and improve relations 
among Davis residents."

Committee establishes 
international standards 
Group recommends full credit for 

academic courses taken abroad 
By mPHANIE SIMPSON 

Contributing Writer 

UCSD's International Strategy 
Committee recently identified three 
specific goals designed to broaden 
the school's international presence, 
including strengthening ties with 
foreign universities and enhanc-
ing current programs. Another 
goal included hiring a new cam-
pus administrator to oversee the 
coming changes, according to Vice 
Chancellor of Research and com-
mittee Chairnlan Richard Attiyeh. 

UCSD is already one of the most 
intemationally oriented campuses in 
the UC system; it includes on-cam-
pus international progmms such as 
International House and has 1,000 
thousand snldents who go overseas 
each year, according to UCSD's 
Programs Abroad Web site. 

However, the conunittee is seek-
ing to find ways to bolster current 
UCSD international experiences. 

"We want to make the intema-
tiona I programs even more user-
friendly by offering 100 percent 
credit for classes taken abroad," said 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Edward]. Spriggs. 

It is currently possible for students 
to study abroad and still graduate in 
four years, but in some instances, stu-
dents receive only transfer credit for 
courses taken while abroad, accord-
ing to Programs Abroad Director 
Kim Burton. Increasing credit for 
classes taken at other universities 

will allow further involvement for 
students concerned about falling 
behind, she said. 

The committee said it hopes to 
accommodate students whose majors 
require them to take classes only 
available at UCSD by establishing 
summer programs and intern hips 
overseas. current example is the 
Prime Program, a service for engi-
neers who wish to perfonll re earch 
abroad during the summer, accord-
ing to Burton. 

Ilowever, the committee's goals 
are not limited to travel options. 
Members also said they emphasized 
the importance of varied academic 
options, and hope to encoumge more 
major and minor choices that have 
global perspectives, such as migm-
tion studies and European studies, 
according to political science profes-
sor and Director of the Institute for 
international, Comparative and Area 
Studies William Chandler. 

"Our international studies major 
has been a tremendous success 
already with some 700 or so stu-
dents," he said. "I hope that we can 
strengthen ourselves in certain areas 
of the world that are of increasing 
importance to DCSD and America 
in general, for example South Asia 
and China." 

The committee plans to develop 
ties with foreign universities in coun-
tries such as Mexico and China, in 
order to enhance faculty exchanges

UCSD alcohol 

program wins award 
A new program, used to address 

high·risk alcohol consumption by 
students, was honored with an 
award from the Automobile Club 
of Southern California and the 
Center for College Health and 
Safety, according to a university 
press release. 

The program, called Substance/ 
Alcohol Feedback and Education, a 
brainchild of UCSD Psychol08ical 
and Counseling Services, was given 
a monetary award and plaque for a 
regional win in the "College and 
University Drinking and Driving 
Prevenllon Award" contest. 

The program employs a unique 
technique called "motivational 
enhancement: which increases the 
need for change in drinking habits, 
according to SAF.E. Director and 
campus psychologisl Jerry Phelps. 
The SAF.E. program utilizes mul-
tiple components, including alco· 
hoi screening surveys distributed 
online, counseling and referral of 
student violators of alcohol pol icy 
to trained peer educators, 

UC Davis scientists 
predict earthquakes 

California has a 25·percent 
chance for a magnitude· 7 earth· 
quake in the next 20 years, accord· 
Ing to UC Davis' "Virtual California" 
computer simulation. 

The simulation also predicts 
that chance to rise over time, with 
a 50· percent chance that such an 
earthquake could hit in the next 
45 years and a 75·percent likeli-
hood that it will occur by 2086. 
Specifically, the San FranCISCo Bay 
Area also has a 25-percent chance 
of an earthquake occurrence of 
magnitude 7 or greater. That 
chance rises roughly 1 percent 
every year, the simulation found. 

The computer program employs 
a technique to predict earthquakes 
that is similar to weather forecast-

ing, accordingto John Rundle, direc· 
tor of the UC Davis Computational 
Science and Engineering Center. 

Online educational 
systems merge 

Former competitors WebCT 
and Blackboard are mergin& but 
will remain separate entities with 
separate services, according to a 
Blackboard press release. The two 
companies provide enterprise soft· 
ware and services to educational 
institutions. 

Over time, however, the merger 
will result in a combination of 
methods between the companies, 
according to the release. 

Blackboard plans to use feed· 
back from customers to incorpo· 
rate the best elements of both 
services into a new product suite. 

"We will combine WebCT's 
strong history and reputation for 
responsiveness with Blackboard's 
significant infrastructure invest· 
ments to deliver industry lead· 
ing support to all clients: the 
press release stated. "In addition 
to maintaining each client's current 
service level agreements, we com· 
mit to deliver even higher quality, 
more individualized support and 
service for both hosted and locally 
installed clients~ 

Company invests in 
Preuss School 

Gen·Probe Inc., a company 
that specializes in DNA research, 
is devoting time and money to 
UCSD's Preuss School, a univer· 
sity charter school for disadvantaged 
and minority students in grades \he 
six through 12. 

Gen-Probe's investment includes 
$108,000 over the next three years, 
which will mostly go toward the 
school's science department The 
funds will serve to create a bond 
between Gen-Probe scientists and 
Preuss School students, induding 
field trips to the company and men· 
toring opportunities.

similar program, dubbed the "Just 
Say Gnome" campaign, publicized 
through T-shirts and posters of a 
gnome urging students to "party 
small." 

The campaign focuses on hold-
ing smaUer patties to avoid alco-
hol-related problems that go along 
with larger festivities and unex-
pected "crashing" guests, accord-
ing to Michael Dorenw, the UC 
Santa Cruz projects coordinator. 

"We poUed students to find out 
what they wanted in parties and 
overwhelmingly they indicated 
that their preference is for smaller, 
more intimate gatherings where 
they felt safe to socialize, dance and 
have fun," Dorenzo said. "Hence 
the party-small approach - pany 
small, as in moderate consumption, 
minimum consequences, maximwn 
fun ." 

Santa Cruz students have 
expressed concern over a "cost-
response" rule, which aUows" the 
city to charge pany hOlits for police 
costs as well as a line for disruptive 
parties, according to Dorenzo. 

Fines have been increased from 
$35 to $250 for first-time viola-
tions, while second and third viola-
tions within a 12-month period at 
the same address increase to $500 
and S I ,000, respectively, Dorenzo 
said. 

"Its aim is to assist police to cur-
tail loud and unruly parties in local 
neighborhoods," he said. 

Despite student concern over 
increased fines, Dorenw also said 
that student response to the initia-
tive has been largely positive. 

"How can you go WTong with a 
small, cheerful, bearded fellow in a 
Ted pointy hat?" Dorenw said. 

Saltz said that while UCSD is ' 
currently a comparison site, for 
the PRC program, he hopes to 

UNIVERSITY CENTERS 

see the campus, as well as the rest 
of the UC system, be included as 
a fuU-fledged intervention site in 
the ·future. 

The UCSD Police Department 
made 46 arrests for on-campus 
alcohol offenses last year, not 
including those for driving under 
the influence and dnmk·in-public 
violations, according to Lt. David 
Rose. 

Between July 2004 and JWle 
2005, UCSD police officers 
recorded 181 arrests or detentions 
for being drunk in public and 46 
our arrests, although not all were 
UCSD students, Rose said. 

In the recent Undergraduate 
Student Experience and Satisfaction 
Report, committee members who 
compiled the report found that 
many students complained about 
the laclc of alcohol at UCSD. 
Specifically, students expressed a 
desire for alcohol at campus-spon-
sored events, like the ~Thank God 
It's Friday" concert established 
years ago, when parties with alco-
hol were held every Friday, accord-
ing to the report. 

"The campus should either bring 
back TGs or create a new regular 
event fuJ6J1ing these needs," the 
report stated. "For example, having 
a barbecue with music and alcohol 
every Friday . .. would be a regular 
event that students could look for-
ward to and reflect positively upon 
after they graduate." 

While a separate committee 
wiU look into the report's findings, 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W Watson said he is not 
convinced that alcohol is a means 
to create a more positive srudent 
experience. 

"Events that bring srudents 
and other members of the campus 
community together wiU incrcasc 
student satisfaction and feelings 

of connectedness to the campus," 
Watson said. "The most importam 
feature [of campus events) is bring-
ing members of the campus com-
munity together for an enjoyable 
event, not the presence or absence 
of alcohol." 

The A.S. Council has proposed 
alcohol-related events in the past, 
including a beer garden at the Sun 
God festival, which Watson reject-
ed last year. The council's proposal 
would have allowed distribution 
of beer to students of legal age to 
prevent binge drinking during the 
day, fonner A.S. President Jenn 
Pae said at the time. 

Although an abundance of 
alcohol at Sun God require addi-
tional police presence, the pro-
portion of violators is small when 
compared to the number of event 
attendees, according to police Cpl. 
Doug O'Dell. 

"At the last Sun God we made 
over I ()() arrests," O'Dell said. " I f 
you think about it, you have 20,000 
people at the event, [and] most of 
the people are there just to have 
fun . A small percentage of indi-
viduals take the Sun God as a poim 
to overindulge, and they're the 
ones that cause problems. We have 
to staff for those people and take 
care of them." 

A beer garden was held over the 
ummer during the Jack Johnson 

concert and went without violations 
or arrests, which may be attributed 
to the fact that the concert had an 
older audience, O'Dell said. 

"Problems at events really 
depend on the mixture of the peo-
ple coming to the event," O 'Dell 
said. "At certain events, there is a 
disproportionate amollnt of people 
there that arc drunk."

deserve to die with dignity 
By NATASHA NAIIAGH. 

Contributing Writer 

F r e e d 0 m to smoke. Freedom to 
drink. , Freedom 
to engage In 
unprotected sex. 
Freedom to eat (or 
not). Freedom to 
expose ones.elf to 
the sun. Freedom 
to drive. 

The contradiction of these 
freedoms should be obvious. 
person can freely and significantly 
increase his chances for lung can-
cer, liver disease, Hrv, cardiac 
arrest, skin cancer and even death. 
Bm in 49 states, when he is given 
less than six months to live, he 
suddenly loses the freedom to die. 

The' only state that current-
ly gives tc'rminally ill patients 
the freedom to end their life is 
Oregon. Bur now, the stare's abil-
ity to recognize this inherent free-
dom is at stake. 

In 200 (, then-Attorney 
General John Ashcroft spoke out 
agai nst assisted suicide, threaten-
ing to revoke a doctor's ability to 
prescribe drugs if he or she did 
so for the purpose of ending a 
patient's life, claiming the prac-
tice was not a "legitimate medical 
purpose" and therefore violated 
the Controlled Substances Act. 
Whether or not he acted within 
his ju ri sdiction wh en he voiced 
those threats is now for the .5. 
Supreme COUrt to decide. 

Behind the politics and minute 
legalities rests a far more potent 
threat than that which Ashcroft 

rre~ented to doctors four yea rs 
ago - a threat against the free-

dOJl1~ of American ci tizens not 
only in Oregon but across the 
narion as well. 

Before understanding the true 
danger posed by the prohibi -
tion of these freedoms, one must 
understa nd the principles behind 
Oregon's Death with Dignity Act, 
which Ashcroft so vehemently 
condemned. 

Fi rst and foremost, the act does 
not give doctors the right to sim-
ply kill patients and murder the 
sick, as many commonly presume. 
Rather its purpose is to let termi-
nally ill patients feel in control of 
their situation and to let them die 
in peace ;ather than helplessly and 
with much suffering. 

According to the seventh 
nnnual report regarding Oregon's 
Death with Dignity Act (DWDA), 
published by the Department of 
I-Iuman ervices (DHS), "The 
Oregon Revi cd Statutes specify 
tha t action taken in accordance 
with the Death with Dignity 
'\ct does not constitute suicide, 
ass isted suicide, mercy killing or 
homicide, under the law" and "the 
most frequently mentioned end-
of-life concerns during 2004 were 
a decreasi ng ability to participate 
in activities that made life enjoy-
able, loss of autonomy and a loss 
of dignity." 

• 

aSSlste 

Lawmakers took great pre-
caution · in assuring that termi -
nally ill patients understood both 
their decision and their condi-
tion before a doctor prescribed 
any lethal medication. Under the 
DWDA, Oregon requires that the 
terminally ill patient, a condition 
determined by two doctors, be free 
of any psychiatric problems that 
may inAuence his or her decision, 
including depression, before doc-
tOrs fill any prescription. 

Moreover, the patient must be 
the one to ask for letha I medication 
before doctors consider the option 
or share it with the patient. After 
making two requests for a lethal 
prescription with at least 15 days 
between each request,. the patient 
must sign a written statement wit-
nessed by two people before drugs 
can be administered - and even 
then, never by the doctor who 
prescribed them. 

What many perceive to be a 
simple process in which a sick 
person's life is rashly taken is actu-
ally a long procedure during which 
doctors are forced to look. out for 
the needs and wants of the suffer-
ing person. 

Fundamentalist Christian 
groups like the Family Research 

Council (FRC), have spoken Out 
against the DWDA, acknowl-
edging a profound discrepancy 

" If a man can legally 
increase his chances 

far death by 
smoking, then he 
should be able to 

freely decide to end 
his life when given 

less than six months 
to live - and John 
Ashcroft ought to 
not be so bothered 
by his decision." 

between a doctor's right to give 
life and the right to take it. 

"To pervert the medical pro-
fession so that it becomes one of 

killing rather than healing poses 
a danger to everyone, particu-
larly the disabled," Bill Saunders 
of FRC's Human Rights Coun.sel 
said. 

Saunders misinterprets the 
position doctors have when treat-
ing tenninally ill patients. Assisted 
suicide is not a question of 1cilling 
or healing, because tenninally ill 
patients have vim13l1y no chance 
of surviving their diagnosed illness. 
Patients who will almost certainly 
die within an exceedingly brief 
period of time can have a doctor 
alleviate pain they might otherwise 
experience. In the same way one 
would argue this to be "playing 
God," one might also argue that 
treating a cancer patient with che-
motherapy in order to prolong his 
or her life is also playing God. 

~I feel strongly that approving 
this legislation is sending a very 
poor message that we, as a state, 
are somehow condoning suicide. 
Helping another person commit 
suicide is a very serious crime. 
Significandy lightening the pos-
sible consequences for those who 
commit this crime sends a very 
dangerous message that we feel 
their actions do not warrant strong 
punishment, " Sen. John Ki.ssel (R-

Michaet Sung/Guardian 

Conn.) said . 
Using the same . mindset, 

Kissel should also share a dis-
taste for a citizen 's fundamental 
right to 3 do-not-resuscitate order 
that courts have long upheld . 
Funhermore, the Department of 
Human Services' annual report 
on Oregon's DWDA clearly states 
"the Oregon Revised Statutes 
specify that action taken in accor-
dance with the Death with Dignity 
Act does not constitute suicide, 
assisted suicide, ' mercy killing or 
homicide, under the law." 

Those opposed to assisted sui-
cide commonly argue that 1cilling 
oneself conflicts with the innate 
human will to survive, but humans 
also possess an equally innate 
desire to avoid suffering. It is cru-
cial that the individual has the 
freedom to choose between the 
two when they come in conflict 
with one another. 

If a man can legally increase 
his chances for death by smoking, 
then he should be able to freely 
decide to end his life when given 
less than six months to live - and 
John Ashcroft ought to not be 
so bothered by his decision. The 
freedom to live and die should be 
neither partiar nor conditional.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

~ I LInERS TO THE EDITOR 
A.S. Council oaths 

stifle dissent 
Dear Editor, 

I am not sure who neutered 
the members of the A.S. Council, 
turning them from pie-in the-sky 
ideologues one imagines of 1960s 
Berkeley radicals into the pitiful 
bureaucrats of UCSD, requiring 
loyalty oaths and running scared 
from administration edicts that 
limit student free speech. UCSD's 
student representatives are little 
more than a younger incarna-
tion of other bureaucratic state 
employees, indebted to rhe fra-
ternities that put them in office 
and the administrators who pay 
their sa laries. 

Loyalty oaths ensure rhat 
only those "loyal" to the views 
of those in elected offices will 
receive committee appoi ntments 
and the stipends that come along 
with them. Such a policy clearly 
eliminatcs all dissent in the ranks 
of campu government - a policy 
that actual government officials 
could only dream of enacting. 
The claim by Mr. Murphy - that 
the A.S. Council represents the 
stuilenr body - is a bsurd because 
less than 20 percent of the student 
body votes in student elections, 
and our A.S. president and vice 
president finance (Mr. Murphy) 
received 36 and 41 percent of 
that vote, respectively. Despite 
their delusions of grandeu r, Mr. 
Sweeten and Mr. Murphy rep-

resent the approximately 1,500 
students who voted for them -
significantly less than 10 percent 
of the entire campus. Funher, an 
important distinctiC!n is neces-

• sary - the A.S. Council does not 
appoint "A.S. Council represen-
tatives" to committees, but "A.S. 
representatives." Appointees rep-
resent the Associated Students, 
not the A.S. Councilor any par-
ticular member of the council. 

A.S. vice president finance 
Greg Murphy claims that appoin-
tees must only limit their dissent 
when they are speaking as A.S. 
representatives, but such a claim 
is simply absurd. t best, such 
a requirement leads to a chilling 
effect whenever a representative 
attempts to put forth an opinion, 
for fear at that moment of being 
in orne "representative capacity." 
. When r disagreed with the 

opinion of former A.S . President 
Jenn Pae , I was removed and 
she replaced me with herself on 
the Regi tration Fee Advisory 
Committec. Current and future 

.S. pre idents should take the 
stcps Ms. Pac did and merely 
appoint themselves to each of the 
campus committees to en ure the 
outcomes they desire. If they do 
not have time to attend all of 
the e ' meetings, they can operate 
in true govern mental fashion and 
appoint their friends - an out-
come I as ume is intended by such 
loyalty oaths. Even an admini tra-
tion accused of cronyism - an 
administration I presume most 

of the council loathes - has not 
dared impose such an adjuration 
upon its nominees.

Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 

Report on MCC 
budget misleading 

Dear Editor, 
I must clarify the mislead-

ing information about the Muir 
College Council budget present-
ed .in "Warren approves higher 
retreat, internal budget," on Oct. 
13 . MCC has budgeted only $200 
for its one-day retreat this year. 
It also contributes to two leader-
ship- conferences: the Muir ew 
Leaders conference in the fall 
and the Muir Spring Leadership 
Retreat in the spring. 

The New Leaders Conference 
is for new leaders at the col-
lege, not exclusively MCC mem-
bers, and the Spring Leadership 
Retreat includes house advisors, 
orientation leaders, Muir orga-
nization executives, employees 
of the Muir College Center and 
MCC members for the upcoming 
year. MCC allocated $( ,500 for 
the twO conferences this year, the 
same amount as last year. 

Since the leadership confer-
ences are not exclusive to MCC 
members and are not even planned 
by MCC, other coll ege groups 
also contribute funding to these 
meaningful and college-enhanc-

ing events. Clearly, these confer-
ences are not MCC retreats. 

MCC always invites all mem-
bers of the community to engage 
with us in our discussions on 
Thursdays at 6 p.m. in Muir's 
Half Dome Lounge.

Muir College Council chair 

Depletion of ozone 
layer not a crisis 

Dear Editor, 
In this day and age, many ques-

tions ari e concerning the environ-
ment - with great arguments on 
both ides of the debate. The issue 
is of vital importance to envi ron-
mentalists, and of no importance 
to critics. I, persomlliy, believe 
that environmental protection is 
oftentimes exaggerated by scien-
tists who are hungry for funding 
or fame (a lthough I must admit 
there are those rare individuals 
who do it for the betterment of 
the world). In Norman ,"'ye r's 
book, "Scarcity or Abundance?," 
the trurh is revealed about chlo-
roAuorocarbons (CFCs) and its 
so-ca llcd "damaging effects." In 
fact, "CFCs at the peak of produc-
tion level were only a quarter of 
a percent (0.0025) of the amount 
of chlorine released every year by 
the sea," implying that the regula-
tions to decrease human-produced 
CFCs i absurd and costworth y.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK 
TH RSDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2005 THE U D GUARDIAN 9 

A mind without borders 
Students, senators learn from immigration studies innovator 

.y KRISTEN WONG 
Contributing Writer 

P olitica l science profes-sor Wayne Cornelius approached the lecrure podium inconspicuously, the leeves of his royal 
blue shirt folded neatly at the elbows. 
Before him a crowd of undergradu-
atc students greeted one another, 
warily eyeing the battery of tcaching 
assistants that had blockaded a por-
tion of the first few rows. 

"First let me congratulate you 
on taking this course on immigra-
tion," Cornelius in toned, his reso-
nam voice chasing away the last 
echo of chatter. 

His next task was to conduct a 
survey to de termine the percent-
age of students descended from 
foreign-born parents. Discovering 
that hi s sample yielded a percent-
age of 75 , he deadpanned wi th only 
a glimmer of a smile: "Immigration 
is really too important an issue to 
leave to the poli ticians." 

For several decades, Cornelius 
has worked tirelessly to prove the 
merit of this statement. As di rec-
tor of the Center for Comparative 
Immigration tudies, begun in 1999 
with Elea nor Roosevelt College, he 
has brought the politics of immi-
gration policy in to the jurisdic-
tion of academia, capita lizing on 
UCSD's arsenal of intellectuals and 
garnering the suppOrt of acadc mic 
think-tanks. 

Idean Sa lehyan, a poli tical sci-

ence graduate student entering 
the final leg of his Ph.D. ca reer 
at UCSD appeared unfa zed by 
Cornelius' assertion regarding 
politicians. His eyes widened in 
agreemcnt as he remarked, "The 
politics of immigration tends to be 
really emotional ... and professor 
Cornelius does a really good job at 
doing real serious academic work 
and then making it relevant to 
political discussions." 

When Salehya n first met 
Cornelius, he was one of a myriad of 
undergraduates attending the pro-
fessor's "Politics of Immigration" 
course. Presently, Cornelius presides 
as a member of the candidate 's dis-
se rtation committee, and Salehyan 
has lea rned much about his mentor 
over the past six years. 

"He's proba bly one of the most 
meticulous people that I know," 
Salehyan said . In his research, in 
his cia ses, even in his personal 
life, he's very exact about the way 
he does things. And he rea lly pays 
attention to all of the details, not 
just the big picture." 

Though meticulous, the profes-
sor is hardly austere. "Are you afraid 
of dogs?" he asked with a mark of 
concern before opcning the door 
to his bright, immaculate office. A 
moment later a chocolate brown 
Labrador retriever bounded up to 
the entrance to welcome his owner 
with a profusion of friendliness.

However, Cornelius admitted 
his path to becoming a univer-
sity professor and world-renowned 
immigration expert was not quite 
so linear. 

"If I had to do it all over again, 
I probably would be a musician 
ra ther than a college teacher, but 
that's neither here lIor there," sa id 
Cornelius Witll an easy smile. 

In fact, the professor's inaugu-
ra l years as an instructor began at 
MIT in 197 1, and it was not until a 
growing Mexican studi es constiur-
ency at UCS D lured him from his 
perch at the el ite technica l institu te 
that he left for California. 

"T his place had a vaguely 
fo mled idea in 1979 that the uni-
versity wa nted to take advantage 
of its position as the only ma jor 
research university on the .5. -
Mexico border, so it occurred to 
a few people here that they should 
have a research center devoted to 
Mexico."

Outreach promises remain unfulfilled 
Despite programs, minorities continue to lag in admissions 

By VLADIMIR KOCiAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

A frer California vot-ers banned the gov-ernment use of racial preferences through Proposition 209, 
University of California administra-
tors and regents scrambled to find 
ways to assure minorities access to its 
elite campuses. As part of the effon, 
the university invested hundreds of 
millions of dolJars into programs 
designed to prepare disadvantaged 
students for the rigors of attaining 
UC eligibility and twice revamped 
its admissions policy. 

But despite the money and chang-
es to the way the university selects its 
students, underrepresented students 
have only dropped further behind 
their white and Asian COWlterparts, a 
GwrdUm analysis of UC application 
and admission data show. 

In press releases, the universi-
ty has generally emphasized rising 
numbers of both minority applicants 

and admits, pointing to the increas-
es as proof of progress in maL:ing 
the university's roUs look more like 
the polychromatic face of the state. 
But in relative tenns, each minority 
applicant has acruaUy seen his or her 
chances of admission drop in recent 
years. 

For example, among students 
applying to enter a UC campus in 
1998 - two years after the affinna-
tive action ban - almost seven out 
of every 10 black applicants and 
almost eight out of every 10 Chicano 
and Latino applicants received an 
offer of admission, according to uni-
versity data. This fall, in contrast, 
fewer than six out of every 10 black 
applicants and fewer than seven out 
of every 10 Chicano and Latino 
applicants were admitted, despite 
heavy invesonent in outreach and 
academic prepar.1tion programs by 
the university in that seven-year 
period. 

Approximately eight of every 10 
white and Asian applicants, by com-
parison, were offered a spot at a UC

( fY'ItL"l't i", ~~ 

campus this faU . 
While students of all ethnici-

ties have seen their admission ra tes 
drop since 1998, largely because UC 
campuses have become more com-
petitive, the dedines for underrep-
resented groups have been larger in 
magnitude. 

uIn tenns of admission rates, we 
have been relatively flat, and we have 
to work harder to improve those," 
UCSD Assistant Vice ChanceUor 
of Admissions and Enrollment 
Services Mae W. Brown said. "But 
we can't use any facto rs that violate 
[propositionI 209." 

Unlike the rest of the unive.rsity 
system, UCSD has actually seen the 
admission rates of underrepresented 
minorities increase over the past five 
years. However, it's stiU harder for 
minorities - especially blacks - to 
gain a UCSD admission than admis-
sion to the average UC campus, 
according to university data .. While 
55 percent of blacks applying for

admission to a UC campus for this 
fall were accepted, UCSD accepted 
just 26 percent of black applicants. 
By comparison, nearly half of all 

ian applicants and more than 
40 percent of whites were offered 
admission. 

"There are certainly other cam-
puses where students continue to do 
well," Brown said. "We really have a 
long way to go before we can reach 
that level of 3ccessibility. ['m greatly 
concerned that we are not making 
up that ground." 

An era of admission.~ reforms 

I n 1999, the UC Board of Regents enacted a new path to eligibil-ity - known as Eligibility in 
Local Context - that guaranteed 
the top 4 percent of studen ts a t every 
California high school 3 spot on at 
least one UC campus. 

"This new approach to eligibil-
ity represehts an hi toric change in 
California higher education admis-
sions," then-UC President Richard 
C. tkinson said at the time. 

The move, Atkinson explained, 
would send a message to all stu-
dents, including those in rurJI and 
"inner-city" ehools - the latter a 
euphemism for urban schools with 
heavy minority populations. 

Two yea rs later, the regents 
approved a massive overhaul to the 
university's admissions, creating a 
more "holistic" approach they called 
Comprehensive Review. Under the 
new system, students received extra 
points for overcoming "Ufe chal-
lenges." 

At the time, conservatives, includ-
ing the Paci6c Legal Foundation, 
one of the groups that helped pass 
the state's ban on racial preference, 
criticized the move as a potential 
back-door attempt to bring back 
race-speci fic admissions. 

"There is a pretty good likelihood 
of a lawsuit," said Sharon Browne, 
one of the group's attorneys, in an 
inter.iew wi th the Los Angeles Times 
a t the time. 

Browne's fears appear to have 
been largely unfounded. 1n fall 2002, 
the first time an incoming freshman 
class applied under Comprehensive 
Review, minorities actua lly saw 
their admission rates drop slight-
ly, according to university dat;\. 
r rhough admission rates have hl!len 
fo r all !,'TOUpS since 1998 , the num-

bers for blacks, American Indians 
and Chic-ano and Latino appUcants 
sagged more than the average.) 

In 2001, the first year new stu-
dents entered through E.LC, black 
and Chicano and Latino applicants 
saw their admission rates rise slight-
ly. But the rates for white students 
rose even more. 

"We have not seen the num-
bers change dramatically, despite 
Comprehensive Review," Brown 
said. "The greatest weight [of 
Comprehensive Review] does con-
tinue to fall to academic achieve-
ment." 

A focus on outreach 

A year before voters fornlally rejected affinnative action, the UC regents pa sed a 
resolution that eliminated the con-
ideration of race, ethnicity an.d gen-

der in the university'S admissions. 
The same year, the regents estab-
lished a special task force to see how 
they could use outreach programs 
- designed to make students aware 
of the university and prepared for its 
admissions - to continue to attr.!ct 
diverse students. 

"In the course of ... discussions, 
considerable attention was given to 
the questions of student eligibility 
for outreach," the task force stated 
in its fiml report, delivered in 1997. 
"The wliversity's outreach programs 
are open to all but, to the extent pos-
sible under the law, should empha-
size increases in underrepresented 
racial and ethnic minority participa-
tion in postsecondary attendance." 

One of the reasons UCSD has 
not seen its minority admission 
rates drop in recent years, accord-
ing (0 Brown, has been its focus 
on outreach programs. While other 
campuses have cut funding to their 
academic preparation progrnms in 
the face of state-funding reductions, 
UCSD has maintained outreach as a 
priority, Brown said. 

"We reaUy have to continue to 
strcss the importance of aCddemic 
preparation," Brown said. 

[n recent years, students them-
selves have begun paying for out-
reach efforts . In addition to the n1il-
lions doled out by the UC Office of 
the President, student governments 
across thc system have invested 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
~tuJcnt-initiated outreach. UCSD's 
A.S. Council alone will spend 

approximately $40,000 this year on 
similar programs. 

One fervent advocate of oua-each 
has been UC President Robert C. 
Dynes. 

"I'm willing to put academic 
preparation money - outreach 
money - into anything that proves 
successful. No goofy ideas, but 
anything that actually achieves suc-
cess," Dynes told GlIllrdinn edi tors 
in January. "In my view, success is 
preparing young people so they can 
actua L1y compete by the II m grade 
and will be eligible for the Uc." 

However, not all believe that 
the money spent on outreach has 
actually been a success. After Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger released his 
budget in January, me state' inde-
pendent Legislative Analyst'S Offiee 
largely rejected the budget'S hopeful 
enrollment growth numbers, modi-
fied to take into account the rise in 
enrollment as a result of outreach 
efforts. That's because the univer-
sity had no evidence at the time 
that academic preparation actually 
led to increases in rates of college 
participation, LAO high.er educa-
tion analyst Anthony Simbol said at 
the time. 

"I didn' t get anything else in 
the pa t months that has changed 
that," Simbol said in an interview 
last wcek. 

Outreach's mixed record 

A p. proximately 44 percent of black, Latino and American Indian freshman attending a 
uc campus in 2002 took part in 
one of the university's outreach pro-
grnms, the university concluded in a 
report for state lawnukcrs. 

While this and similar reports 
do show the success of students who 
take part in the programs, they have 
stopped short of proving tha t the 
programs themselves were respon-
sible for that success, imbol said. 

"It's unclear what has caused 
these things to happen," he said. 

The problem is what social scien-
tistscall a "selection bias."Evaluating 
outreach program is like evaluating 
heart disease patients on a certain 
drug. While the patients may have 
more heart attacks than the general 
popula tions, there may be no reason 
to think that the drug's side effects 
are responsible; after all, people who 
rake heart Il1cdic,ltion start off with 
weaker hearts.

To get around selection biases, 
drug companies rely on placebos, 
but outreach programs have no pla-
cebo. And without one, there is no 
way to know whether the students 
who participate in them wouldn't 
have been accepted to a UC campus 
anyway - without outreach. 

"We've funded outreach pro-
grams, and there's no accountability. 
'We don't know where the money 
goes," state Sen. Jackie Speier (0-
San Francisco/San Mateo) told a 
group of UCSD student leaders in 
a meeting last year. "If it's all abeur 
having [the wliversity] go out to high 
school campuses and say, 'IIi, we're 
here, come apply,' it's not going to 
change the nwnber of minority stu-
dents that are attending here." 

Speier serves as a member of 
the state Senate's Higher Education 
Subcommittec. 

The 1997 outreach task force 
set up goals for the university's pro-
grams, but they focus morc on the 
number of students that participate 
and how they do academically, not 
on establishing the effica<.y of aca-
demic preparation. 

"UC eligibility and competitive 
eligibility lIumbers have increased 
for students participating in many 
of the university'S student academic 
development programs and in most 
categories are on track to meet the 
[task force'sl numerical goals," a spe-
cial panel of experts stated [0 Dynes 
in a 2003 report evaluating UC 
outreach. 

However, the panel conceded, 
the numerical goals fail to estab-
lish a causal relationship mat links 
academic preparation and higher 
admission for its participants. [f 
outreach were a medical treaonent, 
its effect on patients would not be 
proven. 

"UC's evaluation of its outreach 
activities has produced outcomes for 
all major programs, but does not 
establish unequivocal cause-and-
effect relationships," the experts 
stated in their report. 

One outreach program that has 
len t itself to a di fferent kind of analysis 
is UCSD's Preuss Schoof Founded 
whjle Dynes was still UCSD's chan-
cellor, the charter middle and high 
sehool was designed to target low-
income and minority students. 

Because too many qualified stu-
dents applied to cnter its first class, 
a random lottery ystem was used to 

fill Preuss School spaces; those who 
were not accepted made up a perfect 
placebo group. 

While university officials proud-
ly announced that 90 percent of 
the school's first graduating class 
received an offer of admission to a 
four-year university, a June 2004 
report painted a much more mixed 
picture. The report compared Preuss 
School students to identi<'"31 students 
who had applied to the school bur 
lost in the lottery. 

"Students in the lOth and II th 
grades at Preuss School and in the 
comparison group seored essential-
ly the same" on state standardized 
tests, the r~port concluded, noting 
that both groups also had nearly 
identical GPAs in the 2003-04 aca-
demic year. 

Criticism of the wliversity for 
failing to show the efficacy of its 
outreach progr.llTl in recent years 
has mounted. 

In 2003, lobbying group Citizens 
gainstGovernment Wastecalled the 

programs a "$62 million marketing 
budget," one that "has no purpose." 
The same yea r, SchwarLenegger 
proposed eliminating state funding 
for UC outreach efforts. 

"I can't imagine a better pro-
gram for him to eliminate," Regent 
John Moores 5<1id to the S(m Ditgo 
Unioll-Tribune at the time. "Those 
dollars could be much better spent 
elsewhere. " 

The state Legislature even-
tually re tored the cuts, but 
Schwarzenegger again proposed 
eliminating outreach in his January 
budget proposal this year. Though 
he grudgingly agreed in the summer 
to return the money, he stated in his 
budget message that he was doing 
so "on a one-time basis, with the 
understanding that the university 
will work with the administration 
to fully evaluate the cost-effective-
ness of each program and eliminate 
those that cannot demonstrate an 
adequate return on invesonent." 

The university is expected to 
present to the Legislature new data 
in th e coming monms - data wat 
will causally test the uccess of its 
outreach programs, Simbol said. 

Even if the data does demon-
strate the programs' effectiveness, 
underreprese nted swdents will 
continue to lag their white and 
Asian counterparts in C admis-
Slons.

Cornelius: Professor pioneered 
unique migration studies minor 

continued from page 9 
minor unique to UCSD and the 
Mexiean Migration Field Research 
and Training Program . . 

Over the years, Cornelius has 
traversed ivy league campuses, 
rural migrant enclaves and borders 
of hom time and space. 

While he's garnered the atten-
tion and respect of media engines 
liL:e "60 Minutes," and advised 
poU tica I coalitions on immigration 
strategies and fallouts , it is his role 
as a teacher and mentor that has 
won him acclaim among colleagues 
and students alike. To be sure, he has 
navigated significant political cur-
rents. This past spring, he advised 
a committee suited with the task of 
crafting an immigrdtion refonn bill 
for Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) 
and Edward. Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
using student-collected data. 

"The result is a piece of legisla-
tion that is much more balanced and 
hwnane and likely to be successful 
in the real world than might other-
wise have been the case," he said. 

However, teaching has proven 
to be Cornelius' crowning achieve-
ment. Christina Ortiz, who has 
selVed as Cornelius' executive assis-
tant since last March, characterized 
his capacity to teach in glowing 
terms. 

"He is devoted to his classes, 
a.nd thrives working with the young 
minds that crowd his classes," Ortiz 
said . "On me same note, his ex-
alumni retum time and again aslc-
ing for advice and guidance in their 
careers." 

Cornelius' current project, pio-
neering the international migration 
studies minor, exemplifies his com-
mionent to undergraduates especia l-
ly. Salehyan spoke of his mentor's 
exhaustless energy in spearheading 
the movement for the minor, which 

has attracted new faculty members 
to teach across a spectrum of disei-
plines. CorneUus also supervises the 
selection process of all applicants 
to the Mexican Migration Field 
Research and Training Program. 
Once he has carefully appointed 
his panel of 22 UCSD undergradu-
ates (graduate students and students 
from universities in Mexico com-
prise tlle reSl of the group), he 
equips them widl what he tcnns 
a "ski ll set" to interview disparate 
migrant populations, analyze statis-
tical data and draw conclusions that 
will be featured in a published text. 

"P hope] t1ut the interna -
tional migration studies minor 
will become a vehicle to qualify 
more student' to work in the field 
of international i:nmigration as 
researchers, lawyers [and] public 
officials," Ortiz said. 

"It's a great way to pick up 
skills," Salehyan said of the new 
minor. "It's a really unique minor 
too because it's not just course 
work .... They definitely build in 
more than just going to class." 

Cornelius spoke candidly of 
favorite authors, historical charac-
ters that fascinate and rCI>e1 him, 
his participation in the San Diego 
Master Chorale as a second tenor, 
and an abundant library that spills 
into three rooms. 

Speculating briefly about me 
possible sequence of his life had he 
defied the recommendation of an 
early voice coach to avoid a career in 
singing, he spoke with even greater 
gravity of me carcers of UCSD stu-
dents who he says suffer from a lack 
of knowledge on border issues; "[tn 
studying immigration I we're study-
ing a live, evolving, sociological 
phenomenon that is both changing 
in itself and is changing us in ways 
that we can only begin to imagine."

Shuttle: Funding a problem 
for capacity ... plagued system 

conlinued from /Jage 1 
a decision on the number of spots 
dlat wi ll be rcsclVcd for student 
parking in that stmcture, according 
to Snec. 

'10 accommodate the rising tu-
dent needs for campus tran porta-
tion, Shuttle SelVices have added 
an extra bus that run during peak 
hours of 7 a.m. to noon, according 
to Shuttle Services Manager Frdnk 
Buono. The increase in shuttle lines 
has not improved the time it takes 
for transportation to arrive, accord-
ing to Warren sophomore Anthony 
Maeay:lg, who frequently parks in 
east <:ampus. Maeayag said he waits 
up to 10 minutes for the shuttle to 
arrive before taking a five-minute 
ride to his parlcing lot. 

Poor fuding inhibits tile improve-
ment of the shuttle system, accord-
ing to the A.S. representative to 
TPCJosh Martino. 

"With on.ly parking fees and a 
few outside sources of income it is 
difficul t to increase the programs 
ftmding," Martino said. "The lack of 
funds may contribute to the shuttle's 
inefficiency. " 

Students have also turn cd to 
the option of parking off campus 
and using Ci tyshuttle, which has 
increased the number of its stops, 
and now serves the Lebon and 
Regents Road area with 27 inbound 
and outbound stops, according to 
Martino. 

Ilowever, Revel.le CoITege senior 
Arabelle Aguirre said she sti ll waits 
up to 20 minutes with a crowd of 
other tudents for a Cityshuttle to 
arrive. 

" I try to leave my house an hour 
in advance just [0 make sure I can 
get to class in time," Aguirre said. 
"[The shuttle] comes more often 
now, but still not consistently." 

long with financial concems, 
public transporCltion efficiency con-

tinues to be a dilemma in the face 
of a growing COllUlluter population, 
according to Martino. 

" I have seen a Cityshuttle pass by 
completely full, only to be foUowed 
by one that was nearly empty," 
Martino said. "Cityshuttle program 
usage has increased tremendously 
over the past two ycars, jumping to 
over 7,000 riders per day, on aver-
age." 

Even witll parlcing pennits, some 
comllluter sUlden ts have trouble 
finding any parlcing on campus. 

"After twO years of trying, I don't 
even bother to look on campus any-
more," Apuy:ln said . 

Based on surveys taken during 
the first two weeks of mis quar-
tcr, cast campus student spaces, or 
"S" spots, remain relatively unused; 
there are more man 1,000 vaC3U1t 
spots even during peak times, Snee 
said. The tota l number of srudent 
parking space has remained rela-
tively unchanged over the past year, 
but removed spots from lots closer 
to campus were replaced at a djffer-
ent location, Snee said. 

"We did add srudent spaces [inl 
east campus during the swnmer of 
2004 to provide for the projected 

Ios..~ of 'S' spaces lin J the west cam-
pus via the rea llocation that took 
place in January 2005," he said. 

Parlcing in cast campus requires 
a bumpy shuttle ride and a tiresome 
hike to class, Apuyan said. U ntil 
construction begi ns on the Hoplcins 
Parking Structure, parking services 
shoujd consider creating spots that 
accommodate both UCSD tudents 
and staff, Maeayag aid.

No.5 Tritons split four 
games at NorCal Open 

Water polo' beats St. Francis, VCI 
but falls to Stanford, Pepperdine 

By NICKY BUCHANAN 
Contributing Writer 

The No. 5 UCSD men's water 
polo team fought long and hard 
on the first day of the two-day 
Northern California Open at UC 
Berkeley against some of the coun -
try's top-ranked teams. They sent 
out a strong wake-up ca ll to the 16 
teams prescnt at the competition 
with a crushing 17-9 win over No. 9 
St. Frdncis in their first game of th e 
tournament on Oct. IS. 

The Tritons put six goals 
through me net in tile first period 
to reach a 6-2 lead going into the 
second. Once the Tritons got hot. 
St. Francis had a hard time kecping 
the UCSD offense under control , 
allowing another four goals in th e 
second quarter to give the Tritons a 
commanding 10-2 lead by halftime. 

It was smooth sailing from 
intermission on as the Tritons 
added seven more goals before th e 
fina l gull to win by a score of 
I 7 -9. Seniors I:!randon Borso and 

Jonathan Ilopkins took control of 
the game with four goa ls each, while 
teammates junior ' I")r Lackey and 
junior Jesse Casell ini added three 
each. Senjors Chris Finegold , Kevin 

Smoker and Steven Jendrusina each 
contributed a goal as well. 

The Tritons hoped to use 
their momentum to their advan-
tage in thei r next match against 
No. 4 Stanford. The lritons and 
the Cardinal went back and forth 
in the matchup; however, it was 
the Cardinal that managed to pull 
through in the end for the close 
7 -8 overtime win . Hopkins netted 
mree goals in the game and Borso 
added two. Meanwhile, Jendrusina 
and Finegold kept the team afloat 
with one goal apiece. 

Movement on the scoreboard 
was slow and each goal pivotal to the 
game, as the score jumped around 
in me first three quarters from 2-2 
to 5-3 to 6-4, with UCSD lead-
ing heading into the last quarter. 
Stanford was the only team able to 
score in the final quarter, fighting 
its way back to a 6-6 tic at tile end of 
regulation. When overtime arrived, 

tanford was able to outscore the 
Tritons 1-2 to win the game . 

On the second day of the event, 
the Tritons topped o . 6 UC 
Irvine 11 - 10 before falling to No. 
7 Pepperdine 7-12 ill the afternoon 
game. Details were unavailable at 
press time.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Volleyball: Courtney's 20 kills lead Tritons 
continued from page 16 

looked past their deficit and scored 
tile next mree points for a 28-29 
lead. Cal State San Bernardino 
could not convert its game-point 
opportunity, forcing the game 
into overtime. The teams plit the 
first two overtime points, creating 
a 31-31 tie. Coyote sophomore 
Katie Hatch notched one of her 
10 kills to give her team a second 
chance at game point. This time, 
however, a UCSD error gave the 
Coyotes the point, the game and 
the 0-1 lead. 

[n game two, th e Coyotes 
jumped out [0 another early lead, 
but the lritons fought back to 
within one, 20-2 1. Once again, 
the Coyotes stepped up their game 
when the Tritons were hot on 
their heels, this time scoring three 
straight for a 20-24 lead. T he lead 
lasted and the Coyotes wound up 
winners in game two, 24-30. 

Down two games to none, 
the Tritons were on the verge of 
losing meir mird-straight game 
to ranked oppone nts. Earlier in 
m e year, the ' Ir itons fell to then-

o. 16 Cal State Los Angeles, 
then- o. 18 Cal Poly Pomona 
and to th e oyote when they 
were ranked econd. This time, 
however, would be differcnt, as 
the lriton sta rted what would 
be their biggest comeback of the 
year. 

Andrew lAo/Guardian 

The comeback began with 
a 7-1 run and a 14-6 Icad to 
open game tllree. Ca l State San 
Bernardino made it as close as 
19- 15, but me Tritons mai ntai ned 
their must-win attitude and scored 
three straight points to regain a 
more comfortabl e 22- 15 lead. T he 
Tritons had no problem closing 
out the game, with junior Kristin 
Halvorsen's ace giving them the 
30-20 win. 

Set Up: Senior Laura Watkins prepares to return a shot to Cal State San Bernardino 
on Oct. 15. The Tritons won the match 3-2 after losing the first two games. 

Despite the easy win in game 
three, the Tritons still needed to 
pull off two more victories in 
as many ga mes to complete the 
comeback. They started tile task 
by goi ng up 7-2 and then 20- 10 in 
ga me four. With a sizable advan-
tage in attack percentage, .295-
.200, the Tritons rolled to meir 
second-straight 30-20 victory and 
forced a decisive game five. 

T he Coyotes took a 0-1 lead in 

the last game before UCSD took 
advantage of two attack errors and 
junior icole Courtney's kill to 
steal the lead, 3 -2. Cal State San 
Bernardino managed to tie it up at 
four apiece, but the Coyotes tal-
lied another two attack errors and 
UCSD freshman Rebecca Bailey 
notched a kill to give the lntons a 
7-4 lead. The Coyotes got back to 
within one point after two UCSD 
anack errors made it 8-7. The 
Tritons finally earned a sizab le 
lead, 12-9. after a 1011 from sopho-
more Amber Ries and a Coyote 
attack error. The Coyotes then 
got back-to-back kills from Lisa 

Dogonyaro to make it 12- 11 , but 
the Tritons countered with a point 
off a Coyote error to make it 13 - I I. 
Freshman Kimberly Carpenter's 
1011 gave the Tritons a game-point 
opportunity, which tlley promptly 
converted on the Coyotes' seventh 
attack error of the final game to a 
IS- II win in game five and a 3-2 
win in the match. 

1 he Tritons, now riding me 
momenuJln from tile comeback. 
will depart on a two-gamc road 
trip, starting against 50nOll1<1 State

No. 9 UCSD gets ninth-straight win 
Tritons hold on to early lead to beat No. 18 Chico State 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The No. 9 UCSD women's 
soccer team extended its win 
streak to nine games with a 2-1 
win over Chico State on Oct. 16 
in Chico, Calif. 

The win was the Tritons' third-
straight over ranked opponents, 
following impressive wins over 
then-No. 12 Cal State Dominguez 
Hills on Sept. 2 1 and then-No.2 
Seattle University on Sept. 10. 

Senior Heather Szafraniec 
helped the Tritons get on the 
board when she squeezed a low, 
bouncing ball just inside the left 
post in the ninth minute, the first 
of the senior's career. 

The goal was set up by junior 
Megan Dickey, who weaved the 
ball through traffic before cross-
ing the assist to Szafraniec. 

Freshman Laura Borenstein 
gave LJCSD a 2-0 lead in the 
52nd minute when she buried 
sophomore Kathy Sepulveda's 
cross from 12 ya rds out. 

The goal was Borenstein's 
second of the season. 

"Before the game, no one was 
able to score more than once 
against the Wildcats," McManus 
said. "The Wi ldcats have the 
best defense in the league." 

Chico State was not bereft of 
chances to score, and put up a 
strong battle against the visiting 
Tritons. The Wi ldcats, who have 
been shut out on ly once thjs sea-
son, got on the board in the 70th 
mjnute.

Coons was the one to ignjte the

No. 21 men's soccer 
wins 1-0 in overtime 
Caplan's goal propels Tritons to 
win over Chico State Wildcats 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Freshman Tom Caplan netted 
the game-winner in the fifth min-
ute of overtime to push the No. 
21 UCSD men's soccer team to a 
crucial 1-0 victory over Chico State 
on Oct. 14 in Chico, Calif. 

"We struggled a little bit since 
the lield was hard and bumpy, which 
made it hard to control the ball," 
head coach Derele Armstrong said. 

Perhaps due to the adverse play-
ing conditions, both teams played 
to a scoreless tie in the 90 minutes 
of regulation play. 

Nonetheless, the Tritons man-
aged to sti ll outshoot Chico State 
by a 10-3 margin. 

"We were threatening [Chico 
State) all of the second half," 
Armstrong said. 

The three shots allowed by the 
Tritons ties a season low by their 
opponents, tying the output of Cal 
State Baleersfield at Triton Soccer 
Stadium on Sept. 17. 

LJCSD's leading scorer, senjor 
Matt Davey, made the notable assist 
for the first goal, which was the 
second of Caplan's career and the 
second in as many matches. 

The golden goal came at the 
94 minute, 57 second marle, when 
Caplan pounded a shot off a Chico 
State defender and into the net to 
lift the Tritons to a thrilling vic-
tory. 

However, itwas UCSD's defense 
that leeyed the victory. 

"Defwsively, it toole a bit of 
adjusting, but we had a good 
command, despite the bad field," 
Armstrong said. 

UCSD senior goalkeeper 
Edward Ruhland picked up the 
shutout, his fourth and the team's 
seventh of the season. 

Ruhland was called on to make 
only one save in the match, as the 
Triton defense kept the Wildcats 
at bay. 

Chico State, which also played 
well defensively, allowed just 12 
shots, five of which were on goal. 

ophomore Wildcat goalleeeper 
Brian Linne tallied five aves. 

The overtime win brought the 
T ri tons' record to 9-3 -1 overa II 
and 6-3- 1 in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association play. The 10 s 
pushed the Wi ldcats record to 3-
9-2 overall and 3-5- 1 in league 
action. 

The victory was encouraging for 
the Tritons, who suffered a frustrat-
ing 2-1 defeat at the hand of Cal 
State Bakersfield on Oct. 12 when 
a Roadrunner nailed a penalty kick 
with one second left. 

UCSD beat Cal State Stanislaus 
1-0 on Oct. 16, but details were 
unavailable at press time. 

The Tritons return to action 
to conclude their season-long 
three-match road trip at Cal State 
Stanislaus on Oct. 18.

The UCSD golf team placed 
sixth out of 12 teams competing 
in the Chjco State Wells Fargo 
Invitational on Oct. 10 and Oct. 
11. The Tritons squared off 
against several of the top teams 
in the nation, including NCAA 
Division-I member UCLA, the 
eventual winners of the event. 

Cal State Baleersfield toole 
the lead on the first day of the 
event, with a total score of 573. 
UCLA turned in an impressive 
performance as well, trailing the 
Roadrunners by only three strolees, 
with a first-round score of 576. 

T he Tritons combined for a 
600, good enough for seventh 
place after day one. Senior Justin 
Grant, who shot a combined score 
of 149, with rounds of 76 and 73, 
led the Tritons. 

Freshman teammates Billy 
Olsen and Ryan Bailey were 
close behind, each with 150. The 
seventh-place standing left the 
Tritons awaiting a second chance 
to move up on the second day of 
competition. 

In the final round on Oct. II, 
the Bruins shot the low score of 
the day with a 290, bringing them 
from three strolees bacle to win the 
12-team title. UCSD's second-
round score of 294 allowed them 
to pass Grand Canyon University 
for sixth place in the competition. 

Olsen and senior Ryo Yamada 
led the way for the Tritons with 

scores of 73 each. G rant shot a 
74 in the final round and Bailey 
and sophomore Chris Hirahatake 
added scores of 75 and 78, respec-
tively. 

The total score of 294 was the 
third best of the day and gave 
the Tritons a three-round score 
of 895, one point behjnd fifth-
place Notre Dame de Namur and 
two strokes ahead of seventh-place 
Grand Canyon University. 

The Triton golfers performed 
consistently throughout the com-
petition with similar final scores 
at the end. Grant (223), Olsen 
(223), Yamada (225), Bailey (225) 
and Hirahatalee (236) all finjshed 
in the top 30 to propel the Tritons 
to their sixth-place finish. 

"Surprisingly, I was pretty 
relaxed during the tournament 
and the other guys helped malce it 
really comfortable for me," Olsen 
said. "Of course, I could have 
saved a few strokes here and there, 
but overall I was satisfied with 
how I played." 

Head coach Milee Wydra said 
he was pleased with the outcome 
as well. 

"The new freshmen are really 
starting to come out strong," he 
said. "It looKs lilee it will be a good 
season after aU." 

The team gets the opportu-
nity to see if the grass really is 
greener on the other side, of the 
ocean that is, in the Hawaij Hi lo 
Intercollegiate Tournament on 
Oct. 31 and Nov. I in Mauna 
Lani, Hawaii.
