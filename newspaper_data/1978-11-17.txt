"Affirmative Action Reasons Explored 

I 

Dr. Percy Russell , head of 'he Medical School's SpeCial 
Admissions Sub-t.'ommil&ee 

By Steve Morus 
Staff Writer 

Two UCSD Affirmative Ac-
tion administrators believe 
that the comments made by 
visiting British Philosophy 
professor Antony Flew (Guard-
ian, Oct. 20) show ignorance of 
the facts behind Affirmative 
Action programs in this coun-
try. 

Bill Byrd and Dr . Percy 
Russell, as the heads of Educa-
tion Opportunity Programs 
(EOP) and the Medical 
School's Special Admissions 
Sub-committee respectively, 
are intimately aware of the 
reasons behind and the 
workings of undergraduate and 
graduate Affirmative Action at 
UCSD. 

What is important to re-
member, said Russell, is that 
for years Blacks in this country 
were prevented from entering 
educational institutions by law. 

Thus, said Russell, when 
Flew argues that Jews, Poles 

and Italinas ha ve made it in the 
system and Blacks have not, 
"he has completely neglected 
these facts , probably because 
he doesn 't kllow about them." 
As recently as 25 or 30 years 
ago , added Russell , there was 
still blatant discrimination 
against Blacks. 

Byrd is confident that Flew's 
statements will "serve as a bad 
example," and hopes that this 
will encourage students to seek 
the facts about Affirmative 
Action . 

Medical Admissions 
Affirmative Action at the 

graduate level, in light of the 
. Bakke deCision , received 
considerable public attention 
recently, said Russell . 

"Special Admissions at the 
Medical School," according to 
Russell, "is not, and never has 
been ethnically oriented . " 
Instead, he explained, special 
consideration depends on proof 
of disadvantage, whether 
economically or culturally, 

provided by the applicant. 
A culturally disadvantaged 

student, Russell said, would be 
one from a background where 
scholarship is not encouraged. 
Typical areas are inner city 
ghettos or remote rural areas, 
such as white Appalachian 
mountain communities . Most 
often, added Russell , economic 
disadvantage is almost indis-
tinguishable from cultural 
disadvantage. 

As for the Bakke decision, 
Russell explained, since the 
Medical School has never 
maintained quotas , (the prac-
tice of reserving a specific 
number of student openings) , 
the recent Supreme Court 
ruling "has no impact here." 
Instead, be said, the number 
and race of special admissions 
students varies every year, 
from 5% to 28% . 

According to Russell , out of 
the current class of 124 medical 
students, 12 are special ad-

The administration is angling 
to cut programs that don't 
produce research grants as 
prolifically as the core 
sciences, Linda Sabo, Aca-
demic Affairs Commission 
member, told the AS Council 
Wednesday. 

Administration discussion of 
program cuts was sparked by a 
letter from Governor Brown 
asking state agencies including 
UC to look into cutting 10% of 
their budgets through elimina-
tion of the five current pro-
grams they determine are most 
wasteful. 

If the total from the five 
programs cut doesn't reach 
10% , agency directors· were 
told to keep cutting until they do 
get to 10%. 

Agency directors are then 
instructed to report to the 
Governor on the possible 
effects of such cuts, and to 
detatl where they would be 
made. 

Sabo said that she had talked 
with Paul Saltman, Vice-

Mesa Fire 
A small eraN fire at the 

southwest end of the UCSD 
Mesa Apartments preoccupied 
residents of the nearby apart-
ments for a little over half an 
hour yesterday afternoon. 

Tbe fire whicb started around 
1: 30 pm charred several 
hundred square feet of brush. It 
was put out after twenty 
minutes. One of the firefi,bters 
stated that If the wind had 
turned the fire towards the dry 
grass field instead of the 
apartments at lea t two more 
fire companies would have 
been required to put out the 
blaze. 

UnlYenlty ot C.lltoml., S.n .Dlego 

Chancellor for Academic 
Affairs, and that Saltman was 
leaning toward cutting those 
programs that don't bring in 
research monies. 

Specifically, Sabo said, that 
means programs like Urban 
and Rural Studies and Third 
World Studies. If such cutbacks 
are made, Third College would 
suffer most, she added. 

Kevin Eckery, UCSD repre-
sentative to the Student Body 
President's Council, said that 
systemwide UC administration 
was given only thirteen days to 
reply to Brown's letter, and 
that a 10% cut might mean a 
loss of $77 million to the UC 
system. 

Sabo added that systemwide 
was considering, as she under-
stood it, closing UC Santa Cruz, 
UC Riverside and one medical 
school if the UC system is 
required to cut the full 10%. 

However, the possibility of a 
full 10% cut, Eckery said, " is 
almost nil. .. he ' ll cut a few 
highly publicized programs 
and then stop. " 

Nevertheless, AS reaction to 
Brown's letter was hostile . 
Communications Commis-
sioner Bill Friedman said that 
closing non-science orieoted 
programs was part of a tradi-
tional emphasis at this school

Flu May -Cut Into 
Blood Drive Goal 

By Ka&berine Hafner 
The UCSD Semi-Annual 

Blood Drive wiD take place on 
the Revelle Campus today, 
collecting donations for the 
University's Reserve Fund at 
the San Diego Blood Bank. 

Accordtng to Ann Rossi, 
Blood Drive Coordinator, 
UCSD's reserve at the Blood 
Bank is available to faculty, 
staff and their immediate 
families. All those who donate 
the requisite pint of blood 
tomorrow will be adding 
"credits" to the UCSD Fund. 

Rossi hopes that this year 
they can beat the 151 pints 
donated last sprin,. Matt 
O'Brien, a UCSD student In 
ch rae of Public Relations for 
the drive, said: "A lot depends 
on the weather. When it' nice 
and lUIUIy out, lots of people 
donate. It's ort of impulsive. 

"Lots of people have had 
colds and flus, and that might 
prove to be a problem," said 
O'Brien, for that is a temporary 
disqualification. 

The Bloodmobile will be on 
Revelle, at Lower Blake Hall, 
between 11 am and 3 pm. 
Anyone in good health, weigh-
ing 110 lbs. or more, between 
the ages of 17 and 65 may 
donate. 

IC you miss this drive, your 
pint of blood can always be 
donated to the San Diego Blood 
Bank, 440 Upas St. San Diego, 
with your specifying that it go 
to the UCSD Reserve Fund. The 
Blood Bank recommends that 
you eat a ,ood meal before you 
donate and drink no alcohol 
within four hours of donation 
time.

Devi I Exists Here 
Says Demonologist 

"The Devil exists, ladies and 
gentlemen, just as he did in the 
days of Jesus Christ. He 
oppresses, possesses and 
attacks . OJ These were the 
words of demonology expert Ed 
Warren, who spoke Tuesday in 
the Revelle Cafeteria during a 
lecture with his wife Lorraine 
on the supernatural in general, 
and ghosts and demons in 
particular. 

The Warrens' mail'temphasis 
that evening was to caution the 
audience not to fool around with 
the supernatural and/or take it 
lightly because it could leave 
the door wide open for unsavory 
characters, such as the Devil, 
to sUp in and do interesting 
things, like take possession. 

Said Ed Warren, "We are 
urrounded by the negative and 

the positive, the angelic and the 
demonic ... we should never fool 
around with the occult." 

By not foolin, around with 
the occult, they mean not even a 
Ouija Board. "Tbe Ouija Board 
is dangerous," said Lorraine 
Warren, "but it's not the board 
Itself .. . lt is an excellent 
vehicle .. . for communication 

(with spirits)." 
In order that the audience 

would take their point eri-
ou ly .. the Warrens came 
equipped with slides and 
anecdotes of their past ex-
periences, some of them nice, 
most of them not. The nice ones 
generally comprised of the 
ghosts of friendly relatives who 
came back to be with their 
loved ones and then appeared in 
a photograph. 

Most of their stories dealt 
with houses that were invaded 
by the Devil or poltergeists. 
One of their comparatively 
amusing stories was related by 
Ed Warren: 

"The father, mother, daugh-
ter, son antt even the family dog

Library Closing, Arts Fee 
Editor: 

Last Saturday afternoon I 
spent studying at Central 
Library, and at 4: 30 pm (a half 
hour before closing time) the 
lights were blinked several 
times to let the students know 
the library would be closing. 
This procedure has been a long-
standing practice for Hbraries, 
and I do virtually the same 
thing as an employee at Scripps 
Library, except our lights are 
blinked at a quarter till the 
hour. I was surprised, though, 
that at a quarter till five (15 
minutes before closing) all the 
lights were turned off. I do not 
know if this is their normal 
procedure, but if it is. I think it 
is rude to have the students 
clamor about in the dark 15

minutes before closing time. 
As long as I am pissed off 

enough to write about CUL's 
closing procedure I might as 
well get something else off my 
chest. I've always found it 
upsetting that there is a 
standard $10 material fee for 
any film course offered through 
the Visual Arts, no matter 
what the class size is or the 
number of films viewed. This 
procedure for charging stu-
dents is simply not consistent 
with some of the other courses I 
have taken. In all of the labs I 
have taken (4BL, 4AL and 
143AL) I have never been 
charged for any of the ma-
terials I have utilized in 
experiments, and in fact , as is 
standard with lab courses, I 

have been allotted an addition-
al $3-5 breakage fee. Does this 
seem fair to all of the students 
involved, or is it just another 
example of how this school 
caters to the sciences over the 
liberal arts. 

It has always been my 
contention that most things in 
life go unnoticed, and more so 
that all of the " big deals" have 
been unnoticed. This is not to 
say that our awareness of 
things has a pitiful destiny, but 
rather than the whole process is 
going to be harder than it 
seems. Indeed, the most that 
we may ask of ourselves is that 
we continue to notice things one 
by one.

that parents who are seeking a 
subsidy to provide day care for 
their children are not willing to 
bear the full costs of their own 
education as he is . He suggests 
that we should delay our 
education if we have children 
and cannot pay the full cost of 
their care. 

Now undoubtedly Strebel is 
not receiving financial aid in 
the form of scholarships or 
'Other subsidies while he's 
attending UCSD . His letter 
bespeaks the righteousness of 
the self made man - one who 
has cared for himself finan-
cially from an early age. But 
one suspects that he has lived in 
a cocoon which has provided 
him with the illusion of self 
sufficiency. Doesn't he realize 
that his education is subsidized 
by the tqxpayers of California 
or would'he have us believe that 
this is television's Fantasy 
Island come true where one can 
pay the cost of their education 
for only $257 per quarter? Does 
he really think that he would be 
subsidiZing someone else 
without being subsidized him-
self simply because a portion of 
student fees go to the day care 
center? Don Strebel cannot 

have been that protected! It is 
Simply outrageous to believe 
that a person would delude 
themselves into believing that 
they can pay the cost of their 
own education when without 
state subsidy a UC education 
would cost in the neighhorhood 
of $5,000 per year. 

The issue IS nOl wnether we as 
students should subsidize the 
cost of someone else's edu-
cation or expenses ' but how a 
system which is overwhelm-
ingly subsidized can be struc-
tured to provide equality of 
access to those who would be 
students regardless of their 
status as parents or non-
parents. 

As for Strebel's contention 
that voluntary charitable 
funding be organized in support 
of day care, I'm certain that 
parents do not have the time to 
develop and organize a funding 
campaign while pursuing their 
studies anymore than he would 
have if he had to raise $5,000 
each year to support his own 
unsubsidized educatioll . Stre-
bel is not being ripped-off by 
the day care program at UCSD 
anymore than he's ripping-off 
the citizens of California.

'Revelle Five': What 
Have They Sacrificed?' 
Editor: 

I have a much more ap-
propriate and practical means 
of punishing the "Revelle 
Five" as they have come to be 
known. Imagine if you will 
constructing five wooden 
crosses in the Revelle Plaza. 
Organize alot of people. maybe 
get a live band, and have a bon 
fire. After the appropriate 
introductions Judith Edwin 
could then nail all five food-
fighters to the crosses amidst 
cheers from lhe crowd. As we 
all walch them suffe r and 
repent {or their wrongdoings 
the Revelle cafeteria could 
serve a buffet type dinner, of 
course they would punch our 
mealcards. We could really do 
it up goOd. All five mothers 
could arrive teary eyed and 
looking generally concerned. 
Maybe get some volunteers for 
apostles. who then could write a 

book about the history of 
Revelle and the plight of it's 
five saviors. The cafeteria staff 
might dress in Roman clothing 
and keep yelling at the crowd to 
watch their kings die. 

Look at it this way, besides 
the Revelle staff getting due 
satisfaction for the food fight, 
they would be supplying a much 
needed social event for the 
socially prehistoric atmos-
phere at Revelle . Then forty 
days after their death all five 
could r turn to deliver us all 
from th l' horrors and unknown 
forces b ·hind the alleged food 
fight at the Revelle cafeteria.

Will Not Pass Quietly Into the Night · 
By Se&b RoM.feld 
Pacific News Serviee 

The nation's moawxtreme 
death penalty W88 put on the 
books in California last week 
after a silent campaign that left 
voters lal'lely ignorant about 
the life-and-death decisions 
involved. 

Proposition 7. which replaces 
a more limited capital punish-
ment law passed l88t year over 
Governor Jerry Brown's veto. 
broadens the application of the 
death sentence and radically 
alters the judicial process that 
determines who dies. 

(Seth Rosenfeld is a Bay Area 
freelance joumalilt.) 

The measure passed two to 
one. although there had been no 
campaign for its support since 
June when it was placed on the 
ballot by Republican slate 
senator John Briggs with 
395,136 petition signatures 
gathered through a sophis-
ticated direct mail solicitation. 
It was the first time this 
marketing technique was used 
in a California initiative. Until 
now, signatures have been 
collected face-to-face.

Editor: 

Thanks to much hard work

excellent start. Our first week 
of business provided many of us 
with a real sense of accom-
plishment; when one bas been

red tape and hassles as we 
have. it's really nice to see our 
efforts finally being appre-
ciated. 

your input if we are to be 
successful. 

We are staffed entirely by 
volunteer labor. People who 
wish to contribute their time, 
can find out more about the 
inner workings of the Co-Op at 
one of our Tuesday night 
meetings. The meetings are 
held at 6 pm at the ~orth 
.Conference Room of the Stu-
dent Center. A splendid time is 
guaranteed for all. 

Brigg's other initiative, Propo-
sition 6, which demanded the 
firing of homosexual teachers, 
and Proposition 5. which would 
have restricted smoking in 
public places. Bolh measures 
failed . 

Proposition 7 supporters 
spent about $500,000 to get the 
measure on the ballot but 
almost nothing during the 
campaign. according to Briggs' 
administrative assistant. Don 
Sizemore. 

"Debate sometimes makes 
voters uncomfortable ." he 
explained . "Nobody likes a 
strong clash of opinion. They 
like nice things. They like to be 
told how to vote. They like 
authoritative statements. " 

Computer-personalized let-
ters and petition froms based 
on this philosophy were sent to 
voters selected with modern 
marketing methods from 
precinct lists. A typical mes-
sage read: 

"Peggy, you can protect 
yourself (rom ruthless killers 
who are walking the streets of 
Castro Valley if you sign this 
petition and return it to Citizens 
for an Effective Death Penalty 
Today." 

An accompanying brochure 
showed a long-haired man, with 
a sign suggesting a swastika on 
his forehead , who was pointing 
a gun at the reader. 

"If Charles Manson sent his 
'family' of drug-crazed killers 
to slaughter your family , 
Manson would not face the 
death penalty under California 
law," the brochure advised. 
Nor would Sirhan Sirhan, it 
maintained, were he to kill 
Bobby Kennedy today. 

Like last June's Proposition 
13, the death law expressed 
citizens' anger at government 
and a decision to take matters 
into their own hands. And just 
as Proposition 13 set off a 
national movement to cut 
taxes, Proposition 7 may 
portend a growing push toward 
harsher crime laws. 
In Oregon, the only other state 
where the issue was on the 
ballot this last election, voters 
chose two to tone to restore 
capital punishment. 

For those of you who have not 
visited our store yet, we are

Passage of Proposition 7 was 
assured early. A Mervin Field 
poll taken in October indicated 
80 percent support. 

Yel many law enforcement 
officials opposed the bill , as did 
most major newspapers. politi-
cal, religious and labor groups. 
including the Teamsters. Many 
shared the concern of San 
Francisco District Attorney 
Joseph Freitas that the bill is 
too broad in scope to meet the 
judicial challenges that any 
death penalty measure must 
face. "The earlier law was 
designed to withstand such 
challenges ," Frietas noted . 
" but Senator Briggs' propo-
sition was not so carefully 
prepared." 

The bill extends the crime 
categories punishable by death 
from 11 to 19. 

One of the controversial new 
provisions states that death 
may be ordered i{ "the victim 
was intentionally killed be-
cause of his race. color. 
religion, nationality or city of 
origin." 

San Francisco Assemblyman 
Willie Brown has called this 

clause " racist. " arguing that 
"j{ there is any evidence at all 
that the homici~e was racially 
motivated, the defendant could 
be sentenced to death ." 

The list of peace officers 
whose killing can now draw the 
penalty is stretched to include 
toll bridge operators. food and 
drug inspectors and 44 others. 

The new law also curtails 
discretion of both judges and 
juries in deciding whether to 
apply the death penalty. rt 
imposes mandatory require: 
ments on each. 

While the previous law 
charged the jury to "take into 
account and be guided by the 
aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances ... and deter -
mine whether the penalty shall 
be death or life without parole," 
Proposition 7 requires that 
juries determine if "aggr-
vating circumstances outweigh 
the mitigating circumstances" 
and orders the judge to impose 
a death sentence if the jury so 
concludes.

Minorities Lose 
In Broadcasting 

WASHINGTON (AP) - MI-
norities "are still being sent to 
the back of the bus" in all areas 
of public broadcasting, a new 
study said Thursday. 

"They are still drinking from 
segregated water fountains. 
They are still nonentities." 

The report said a vicious 
cycle exists to exclude minor-
ities from public broadcasting. 
As an example it cites difficulty 
in obtaining funds from tradi-
tional sources of station sup-
port. 

"The U.S. Department of 
Health, Education and Wel-
fare's Educational Broad-
casting Facilities Program, 

which awards grants for the 
start-up, continued expansion, 
and improvement of public 
broadcast stations, awarded 
$UI.24 million to local stations 
between 1963 and 1976," the 
report said. "Of this amoUnt, 
less than $2.1 million was 
awarded to minority-controlled 
public broadcast stations." 

The report, financed by the 
Corporation for Public Broad-
casting, had harsh words for its 
sponsor as well as the two other 
national public broadcasting 
organizations - National 
PubliC Radio and the Public 
Broadcasting Service.

Jarvis Turns Against Gann 
Over Proposed Measure 

SACRAMENTO (AP) - Pro-
position 13 autbor Howard 
Jarvis says bis tax-cutting 
partner, Paul Gann, is pushing -
a new spending limit ballot 
measure to make money, and 
Gann says Jarvis is "irra-
tional." 

The bitter, name-calling rift 
between tbe co-sponsors of 
California's property tax cut 
initiative was revealed when 
tbe men were filmed this 
montb by public television 
crews. 

As be relaxed with aides', 
Jarvis said a proposed ballot 
measure sponsored by Gann to 
limit state and local govern-
ment spending was "shit." 

"I am not going to blast him. I 
don't give a damn," Jarvis said 
without turning off the micro-
phone. "Gann is trying to 
promote something to make 
money. For Gann, " added 
Jarvis, who represented a 
group of apartment owners in 
the 13 campaign. 

Sbown the film, Gann denied 
he was making money off the 
initiative campaign and 
launched his own attack, 

saYlDg Jarvis was "irrational" 
and suffered from "diarrhea or 
the mouth." 

"Howard has a very difficult 
. problem with the Eaglish lan-
guage," said Gann, a 66-year-
old retired real estate agent... 
"It's hard forbim to get above a 
two-letter word. He says 'I' 
and 'me' very well. 

"Howard should be careful 
how be makes statements like 
that in the first place. He did lay 
himself libel (sic). If I were the 
type of person that wanted to 
use it, I wouldn't because I 
know Howard and I know how 
irrational he is." 

Jarvis' comments and 
Gann's reaction will be sbown 
Friday, Saturday or Sunday on 
12 Public Broadcasting Sys-
tem stations in California. The 
film was shown yesterday to 
The Associated Press. 

The two men, heads of 
different groups which joiDed 
forces to qualify 13 for the June 
ballot, were known not to be 
close, but they bad insisted 
previously that their relation-
ship was cordial. 

Modified Treaty? 

The slaty, ~year-old Jarvis 
was filmed on election day in 
Los Angeles by a California 
Public Television crew that 
fitted him with a wireless 
micropbone he could tum oU 
when he didn't want his re-
marks recorded. 

WASHINGTON (AP) - Dis-

soon/ol/, 

Under 0 OfW-ton wrecking btUl, 
For Fifty yeors it's been oround this 

town, 
Now the city council wants to teor it 

down." 

I n these words by Mission Beach poet Eddie Forrey the 
uncertain fate of the 

Belmont Park roller coaster is 
summarized, striking a tender 
chord in the hearts of many who've 
known its thrills and fear its 
demise. 

If one is inclined to venture down 
to Belmont Park nowadays, a 
desolate ghost town is all that 
remains of a once-thriving amuse-
ment park . Creaking boards 
swinging in the breeze and empty 
Coke cans blowing down the 
windswept walkways are taunting 
imitations of the screams of joy 
and the blaring Calliope music 
which used to ring out ipcessantly. 

The park was closed last 
November after owner Bill Evans, 
losing money, decided he wanted 
out. Its 17.6 acres are now walked 
by security guards instead of 
laughing chlldren clutching cotton 
candy and caramel apples. 

Amid the abandoned buildings 
rises the dilapidated structure 
which has been the 80Urce of 80 
much recent controversy - the 59-
year-old roller coaster, the pride 
of Mission Beach; the envy of 
people from as far away as 
Australia; the "last monument to 
thrills and joy." 

Eddie Forrey wonders a lot 
about what sort of "callous 
people" would vote to destroy this 
monument. The answer lies with 
city hall. The controversy has 
involved budget-minded city 
Officials and staff members on one 
side, and historical buffs and 
entimental residents on the other. 

The Guardl .. 

It all began several years ago, 
when the local historic site 
cOmmittee, created by the CitY" 
Council, dubbed the Belmont Park 
roller coaster local Historic Site 
No. 90. Recently, the state 
affirmed this action by recom-
mending to the federal govern-
ment that the coaster be placed on 
the National Register for Historic 
Sites. 

If this is accomplisbed, the city 
could not itself demolish the 
coaster without risking federal 
matching funds. While the out-
come remains in limbo, con-
troversy rages on in city hall. 

City engineers say the coaster is 
structurally unsound, too ex-
pensive to refurbish as well as too 
dangerous to operate. Also, they 
contend, it has no place in the new 
park redevelopment plans. 

City Councilman Larry Stirling, 
reflecting this sentiment, called 
the coaster an "historical nui-
sance." 

Technically the coaster does not 
actually belong to the city, but 
rather to private owner Evans. 
Evans called tbe coaster a 
"landmark" and o(fered to donate 
it to the city. Cost estimates range 
between $50,000 and 'lOO,~ust 
for cosmetic refurbishing 

Council members, however, 
voted 4-1 last Tbunday in a special 
hearing to order Evans to apply 
for a demolition pennit. The one 
dissenting vote was cast by 
councilman Tom Gade. The 
motion must be passed by a full 
council in order to take effect. 

The city is not worried about 
risking federal matching funds, as 
was earlier feared, because the 
coaster is technically private 
property still, and it is Evan's 
respoDsibility to address the 
restrictions on it as an historical 
site. 

A city staff member said the · 
only possible penalty facing Evans 
if he demolished the structure 
might be a loss of the income tax 

deduction for the 
work. 

Meanwbile, a coalition of 
coaster advocates, led by Eddie' 
Forrey, has been mobilizing 
support for the preservation of the 
historic monument. In his Mission 
Beach headquarters, on the 
boardwalk outside of Hamel 's 
Bike Shop on Ventura Place, 
timely slogans and pieces of 
coaster history portrayed in 
newspapers adorn the-wall. "San 
Diego needs something besides a 
zoo!" reads one slogan. A yel-
lowing newspaper article refers to 
the coaster as "a guady, faded 
queen - adored from afar, 
ignored by those who know her 
best." 

Forrey talks with wistful 
enthusiasm about his special 
concern. "Paint it, fix it up as a 
shrine/Dedicate it to happiest, 
childhood times," is his prescrip-
tion for the coaster, wbich is one of 
only 200 left standing in the United 
States. In fact, one compromise 
alternative proposed to the 
Council was an offer by Aero 
World representatives to save the 
coaster cars and a portion of the ' 
stnicture to be used as a display in 
the proposed $55 million aviation 
theme park in Mira Mesa, de-
signed by Meyers Jacobson. 

But Forrey says the community 
would like to retain the coaster in 
Mission Beach in order to preserve 
the memories of all those who rode 
it or knew it in its heyday. "It was 
simply exhilarating, a real thrill to 
ride," said Forrey. "I would call it 
a sort of happiness tranquilizer." 
Forrey would ultimately like to 
see the roller coaster restored to 
operating condition, but lamented 
that "everytbing nowadays is 
equated with a fast buck. If 
something is inefficient, 'tear it 
down' is the first reaction of most 
people." 

As the sun sank into the grayish 
waters off Mission Beach, the 
coaster loomed monstrou Iy in the 

I 
J 

~ 

t 

twilight, dwarfing Forrey's wiry 
figure. The white peeling paint and 
rusted steel tracks seemed to 
blend together, looking like some 
vastly enlarged plumbing system 
to the imaginative mind. Forrey 
nostalgically concluded his tribute 
to the coaster: 

"The echo 0/ children's loughter we'll 
no longer h~or. 

The end/or thO' cooster I/eor is n~ar. 
It stands u"\4Iant~d, poi", puling 

awoy, 
Why? children Qs.k me; what con I 

soy?" • 

If the Council decide to order 
Evans to raise the tructure , 
another cultural 10 s will be added 
to the long Ii t of van! hing specie 
of which only memories remain.

USE ENCARE OVAL 

• 
• 

Encare Oval" was introduced to Ameri-
can doctors in November 1977. Almost 
immediately, it attracted widespread phy-
sician and patient attention. 
Today. Encare Oval is being used by 
hundreds of thousands of women. and 
users surveyed report overwhelming sat-
isfaction. Women using Encare Oval say 
they find it an answer to their problems 
with the pill, IUD's, diaphragms, and aero-
sol foams. 2 EFFECTIVENESS 

ESTABLISHED IN 
CUNICAL TESTS. 

Encare Oval" was subjected to one of the 
most rigorous tests ever conducted for a 
vaginal contraceptive. Results were 
excellent-showing that Encare Oval 
provides consistent and extremely high 
sperm-killing protection. This recent U.S . 
report supports earlier studies in Euro-
pean laboratories and clinics. 
Each Encare Oval insert contains a pre-
cise, pre measured dose 01 the potent, 
sperm-killing agent nonoxynol9. Once 
properly inserted. Encare Oval melts and 
gently effervesces. dispersing the sperm-
killing agent within the vagina. 
The success of any contraceptive 
method depends on consistent and 
accurate use. Encare Oval " is so conve-
nient you won't be tempted to forget it. 
And so simple to insert, it's hard to make 
a mistake. 
If pregnancy poses a special risk for you. 
your contraceptive method should be se-

31ected after consultation with your doctor. NO HORMONAL

ices, but students aren't aware 
of this ." 

Althougb a separate facility 
from the sex clinic, the Con· 
tracepti ve Counseling and 
Education Service works in 
conjunction with the clinic to 
provide "all types of birth 
control," said Keating. The 
clinic itself does nOJ provide

Therapy, according to Pates, . 
"usually lasts from four to

treatment of the type recom-
mended by Masters and John-
son, which involves "(;ouple 
related therapy." 

Pates says that "It is better if 
individuals come to the clinic 
with their partners," due to the 
fact that " the Masters and 
Johnson techniques involve 
treatment primarily designed 
for steady couples with sexual 
dysfunctions ." Treatm e nt

"Over the lpt four year,," 
said Pates, "Approximah'v 
220 students, iDcIudiDlIJ'8CIu' 
ate and medical atudentl, bave 
undel'lone treatment at the sex 
cUnic." 

The orillnal aims of the 
clinic, establilhed In 1974, 
included meetiq the increased 
demand for sexual counseling 
and to provide treatment within 
the limited time framework 
that college life presents. In an 
article that appeared in the 
TrilOn Times prior to the first 
session of the clinic, individuals 
or couples seekinl sexual 
counseling or information were 
invited to attend the informal 
weekly session. 

Actual counseling and thera-
py at the sex clinic is "com-
pletely verbal, " said Keating. 
"Couples are given sUliestions 
for the solutions of their 
problems. Then they go home 
and practice them." Couples 
will then report back to the 
clinic the following week and 
report on whether the "sug-
gestions" helped to resolve 
their sexual problems. Ac· 
cording to Keating, "if the 
suggestions didn't work, then 
we find out why they didn't. " 
Additional counseling in pro-
vided until the problem is 
resolved. 

" Students are misled," said 
Keating, "into believing that 
the sex clinic is an actual 
clinic." The clinic itself is an 
office in the Revelle Provost's 
office. Interaction between 
couples "on a physical level" 
takes place in the student's 
privacy, away from the clinic. 
Said Keating , "There is no 
supervised sex taking place at 
the sex clinic." 

The UCSD sex clInic, which 
provides free service to stu· 
dents , is open on Thursdays 
from 1-2 : 30 . Students may 
come in for advice or sched· 
uling for treatment, said Pates. 
"on a drop-in basis."

St dy: Possible Pill ........ Skin Cancer Link 
By Kevili MeKeaa 
AP Sd(jIIft Wrt&er 

NEW YORK - A study in 
suburban Saa Francisco has 
turned up a possible link 
between the use of birth control 
pills and skin cancer, but an 
expert says the finding may be 
a "falae alarm." 

The link appeared in an eight-
year study of 17,942 women 
enrolled in the Kaiser Foun-
dation Health Plan in Walnut 
Creek, Calif. 

Women who had used the pill 
for four years or more were 
about 70 percent more likely 
than non-users to develop 
malignant melanoma, an often 
fatal cancer of the pigment 
cells of the skin which kills 4,300 
Americans a year. 

The study also said women 

with a history of skin cancer 
and women who already had 
malignant melanoma were 
more likely to be pill users. 

But the authors of the study 
said the number of cases - 22 
new cases of the disease among 
the sample group - was too 
small to draw a definite 
conclUsion. 

Melanoma is thought to be 
touched off by the ultraviolet 
rays of sunlight, and people 
who are fair-skinned, blue-eyed 
or given to frequent sun baths 
are more likely to get it. 

The authors of the study said 
it was possible the pill in-
creased susceptibility to sun-
light. 

But they said, in a report in 
last December's British Jour-
nal of Cancer, that other effects

might be causing the problem 
and more study was needed. 

"I think it may be a false 
alarm ," said Dr . Donald 
.~ustin, head of the California 
Tumor Registry at Berkeley. 

"There's a good possibility 
that womerr on the pill may 
h-ave more sun exposure than 
women not on the pill. We know 
that women who choose the pill 
are different from other women 
in other ways." 

One example of that differ-
ence turned up in· an earlier 
study based on the Kaiser plan. 
Dr. Savitri Ramcharan, head of 
the Kaiser study and co-author 

of the melanoma report, said an 
increase in cervical cancer 
among pill users could be 
partially explained by dif-
ferences in their sexual be-
havior. 

Austin noted that the rate for 
malignant melanoma was 
rising in the San Franciaco 
Bay area as fast for men as it 
was for women. The rate for 
both sexes has increased from 
about 5 new cases per 100,000 
per year in 1970 to about 10 per 
100,000 in 1975, he said. 

In the Kaiser study, th'! rate 
of malignant melanoma for 
long-term pill users was set at 

29 per 100,000, compared to 17 
per 100,000 for women who had 
never used the pill and 24 per 
100,000 for women who had used 
it.less than four years. 

Birth control pills are known 
to stimulate the formation of 
melanin, the skin-darkening 
pigment produced by the cells 
involved in melanoma. A 
darkening of moles and birth-
marks is a not-uncommon side 
effect. 

There is a well-established 
link between use of the pill and 
circulatory diseases , espe-
cially for women who smoke. 
But · no firm link has been 
established between the pills 
and cancer. 

Ocean Drugs Promising 
By Donald Lawson 

While· cautioning against 
excessive optimism, Dr. D. 
John Faulkner last week 
described promising research 
which may lead to new antibio-
tics and anti-tumor drugs from 
marine organisms. 

Dr. Faulkner, Associate 
Professor of Marine Chemistry 
at Scripps Institution of Ocea-
nography, spoke at the last of a 
series of public lectures in 
honor of the 75th Anniversary of 
the founding of Scripps. 

Dr. Faulkner described the 
two main approaches used in 
the search for potentially useful 
compounds from marine 
sources. In the "screening" 
approach, marine organisms 
are collected at random , 
extracted, and the extract used 
in a biological test for anti-
microbial or anti-tumor ac-

tivity. Currently, about 11% of 
the marine organisms tested 
show compounds with anti-
tumor activity (versus about 
3% of the plants tested by the 
National Cancei-lnstitute) . One 
of the most interesting samples 
discovered by Dr. Faulkner'S 
group was a sponge that 
arrived "stinking to high 
heaven" in a brown paper 
parcel from a vacationing 
biologist. While this -approach 
can be rather slow and un-
certain, it is unlikely to miss 
any interesting compounds. 

In the "ecological " ap-
proach, Dr. Faulkner and bis 
colleagues study the observa-
tions of marine ecologists, 
particularly animal behavior-
ists, for clues to the presence of 
active compounds. For ex-
ample, many apparently de-

fen~less organisms wb·'!h are 

not attacked by predators 
produce or store toxic sub-
stances which may be useful to 
man. 

Dr. Faulkner cautioned , 
however, that "it is up to the 
pharmaceutical house, not the 
university scientist, to decide 
which pharmacological effect 
is desirable to develop into a 
marketable drug. This process 
requires 10 to 15 years of work 
at a current cost of about $50 
million." 

Dr. Faulkner also expressed 
the hope that pharmaceutical 
companies would not pillage 
the sea for their raw material, 
but would produce their own 
drug supplies . "I certainly 
hope," he said, "that corals 
won't be used as a source for 
prostaglandins, as has been 
proposed by some."

" A hairbrush came up , 
whizzed past us, went down the 
hallway and almost hit one of 
the TV crewmen. I heard him 
say 'These people ha ve got to be 
kidding!' and w.e lost the 
crewmen that night." 

In describing another house, 
Lorraine Warren said "We had 
salad oil , ketchup, soda , 
colognes that would just 
levitate 0(( of the shelves, out of 
cabinets, and go across the 
room, tum over, unscrew their 
caps, and empty their contents 
in different parts ofthis home." 

Lorraine and Ed Warren 
were party to the investigation 
of the Amityville house on LoIlg 
Island. This was the scene of a 
series of terrifyine happenings 
in 1975. These events occurred 
during the 28 days that the Lutz 
family stayed in their new 
home. 

One of these incidences 
involved the night visits of a 
little pink pig to five-year-old 
Missy Lutzes bedroom. She 
called this pig Jody, and it 
conversed with her telepath-
ically. The Warrens believe 
that this pig was an incarnation 
of the Devil, who appears to 
have been trying to gain a 
foothold on the family through 
the little girl. 

Kathy Lutz experienced quite 
a few horrifying moments when

'Waiting for Godot' is Bizarre 
The San Diego Repertory 

Theatre is unique among San 
Diego theatres in that it is" a 
church building. As Is often the 
case with the unique, i~ is also 
uncomfortable; to sit in pews 
(albeit padded ones) for two 
hours is not exactly soothing. 
Neither is the play which 
finishes its four week fun this 
weekend, Beckett's Waltln, 
For Godot . Shows are Friday, 
Saturday, and Sunday evenings 
at 8:00 pm. 
"Yes, now I remember. Lasl

ESlragon 

Waiting For Godot is a 
dangerous piece to criticize. 
Attempts at exegesis often 
degenerate into weak plot 
summaries, or befuddling 
interpretations . This is not 
surprising in that the play's 
action is truly bizarre, that is to 
say commonplace in real life,

cleverly resolved . This fact 
alone places the piece outside 
the realms of Tragedy and 
.Comedy as conventionally 
defined. After all the talk of 
minimalism, of parables, of 
tragicomedies, there remain 
these four droll creatures 
haunted by their selves and by 

because unexpected a~ such . 
Here is the flighty. the sanguine 
one, who is _beaten up every 
day, the poet. His hypertense 
pleas and flippant petulance 
provide sharp and poignant 
counterpoint to Didi's wet-
fishiness. All through the play 
these men perform slapstick 
"canters," hugging, dancing, 

spe nds waiting on Pozzo 's 
whims or standing, slumped, 
laden with Pono's materiel. 
This hopeless creature is nicely 
played by Clark Miller, with 
grey face and hair and a 
muttering, mechanical voice. 
He too is afflicted; in the second 
act he is dumb. This dumbness 
and Pozlo ' s blindness are

on a stage which used to be the 
chancel of the St. Cecilia 
Chapel , an adjunct of the 
neighboring funeral parlor. 
"Don't question me! Don't 
louch me! Don' l speak to me! 
Stay with me!" - ESlragon 

Despite the improbability of 
many of their conversational 
topics, Vladimir and F.J;tr:Ulnn 

really the only events which 
could be construed as some sort 
of " statement" of Beckett's 
part, but be careful , the events 
are non-events , occur outside 
the play's action if at all , and 
for them there is no discernible 
reason . 

" . mind the goats, sir." -
Boy, to Vladimir 

Guardian 

exchanging hats in a way that 
led Norman Mailer to hypothe· 
size that they are homosexuals , 
a connotation readily derivable 
from the action . Again this is 
interpretation. The men are so 
closely bound up with each 
other, so organically needful of 
one another, they orten seem to 
be one man rather than two. 
"He's all of humanity." -
Eslragon, of Pozzo. 

The Boy a ppea rs a t the end of 
each act, to tell the hapless pair 
that Godot won 't be coming 

he was approaching perfection 
in his expression, after many 
years of expression in blind-
ness . He wrote Godot in a 
month's time. Like most of his 
work , Godot is almost shame-
fully autobiographical ; one 
safe summation of the work 
might be " Sam Becketts (sic) 
confronted by humanity." 

Humanity definitely gets a 
short end of the deal , and 
Becketts gets the other. There 
are no heros to arouse fear or 
pity, only fools to laugh at with 
vague loathing. Nonetheless, 
I've seen the play six times and 
I think it's beautiful (but then, 
I'm the kind of guy who would 
go to Waiting For Godot six 
times) , as the expression of a 
man soaked in literature and 
philosophy, complex to a point 
nearing silence, with an acute 
sense of the history of human-
kind as well as a sense of his 
own humanness. 

The Rep's production of the 
piece is by no means perfect,

These two confront Pozzo and 

Lucky , a master and his slave.

play, itself rather good, is about 
three insipid young women who 
go from being daffy high school 
cheerleaders to yammering 
college "coeds " to bitchy , 
disillusioned thirty year olds. 

The disillusionment, it 
seems, arises from the fact that 
Joannie, Kathy and Mary (but 
especially Kathy and Mary) 
have lost the theme for living. It 
was easy in their Texas high 
school - "Over the Rainbow" 
homecoming dances and "Twi-
light Time" proms. In college, 
the games and dances gave 
way to the sorority - " Kappa 
Kapers " and " KKG Eter-
nally." But after that there are 
no more corny themes to live 
by, no schmaltzy slogans to 
chant - it's the real world. 
Joannie turns to a boring life of 
planned breeding in a Con-
necticut suburb. In New York, 
Kathy is " kept" in a garden 
apartment and Mary sells high 
class pornography in an ex-
clusive gallery funded by 
various bedroom endowments. 

Edythe Pirazzini has staged 
these three phases in the 
women's lives without an 
intermission. The entire play,

enters the theatre. (The set is 
equipped with three vanity 
mirrors for costume and 
makeup changes, while mov-
able cubes suggest living areas 
and furniture.) 

The acting in VanUies is not 
oarticularly good - the charac-
terizations are neither well-
differentiated nor well- con-
trolled . But this flaw, per-
formance, is easy to overlook 
as it is subsumed into the 
overall enjoyability of the 
production. Vanities works 
because its text is compelling 
and not old hat. Mediocre 
acting diminishes its force only 
a little.

Asked if the Board antici-
pates any problems resulting 
from the sale of alcohol , 
Lapping responded, " No. The 
contractor will be responsible 
for checking I.D.'s , and any 
alcoholic beverages purchased 
must remain on pub premises. " 

Students, faculty and staff 
were asked to fill out a quest-
tionnaire set up by the Board in 
a recent edition of The Guard-
ian . According to Lapping. the 
results indicate support for the 
pub and "were, on the whole, 
positive.' He added that the 
administra tion is also sup-
portive of a pub on campus. 

Choosing a contractor is the 
Board's " highest priority ."

step, Lapping said . Bidding will

'Paradise Alley' 
Another Winner 
From Stallone' 

By Bed! Accomando 
Sylvester Stallone is be-

coming a raconteur of lower 
class fairy tales where sen-
timental fantasy and gnlty 
reality live side by side. In 
Paradise Alley, as in Rocky , 
Stallone synthesizes these 
seemingly incompatible ele-
ments into a wonderfully 
charming and vibrant film . 

Paradise Alley tells the story 
of the Carboni brothers: Cosmo 
(Stallone), a street hustler 
always looking for a one-way 
ticket out of Hell's Kitchen; 
Lenny (Armand Assante), a 
war hero now working as an 
embalmer; and Victor (Lee 
Canalito), a muscular iceman 
who dreams of living on a 
houseboat with his Chinese 
girlfriend. The Carbonis want 
to get out of their grim lifestyles 
and they find their means of 
escape in Victor's ability to 
wrestle. 

The film has a firm founda-
tion in optimism and sentimen-
tallty, but Stallone keeps it 
fresh by continually adding 
twists to stock situations, such 
as having Stallone's romantic 
moment cut short when the girl 
notices pigeon shit on his 
shoulder. 

Stallone's Paradise Alley is 
strongly reminiscent of Frank 
Capra's wonderfully uplifting 
films of the thirties . Stallone, 
like Capra , is charmingly 
corny, is a staunch believer in 
an individual's ability to 
overcome all odds (Stallone 
'himself is an example of what 
he calls " roaches to riches" 
success), and is the major 
creative force behind his films. 

On Alley he costars, directs , 
writes, and even sings the title 
song, a feat for which he says 
the music critics will probably 
murder him. Although Stallone 
craves creative, control he 
doesn't use it to push aside 
others: he surrounds himself 
with an exceptionally talented 
cast and he gives them plenty of 
room to grow. 

The acting in Alley is superb. 
Stallone, who has the rare gift 
of being a powerful screen 
presence, gives a brilliant and 
above all entertaining per-
formance . Assante and Can a-
lito are also excellent as the 
other brothers. The standouts ' 
of the fine supporting cast 
are Frank McRae's touching 
performance as the past-bis-
prime wrestler; Kevin Conway 
and Terry Funk as the de-
liciously evil villains; and Anne 
Archer as the girlfriend that 
gets left behind once too often. 

Alley is not a flawless fUm but 
its flaws, such as some loose 
ends in the plot, aTe trivial 
when compared with the film 's 
power to entertain. Stallone 
charms an audience with his 
sense of humor, daring nature, 
vitality and hardcore op-
timism. Stallone reveals that 
not only is he a talented writer 
and actor, but also an excellent 
director with an outstanding 
cinematic sense. Even though 
Stallone is still like a rough 
diamond in need of polishing, 
his natural brilliance still 
shines through. 

Overall Paradise Alley is a 
vivacious piece of entertain-
ment which does not have a dull 
moment.

Great Acting Makes 
By Be&II Aceomaado 

Map: II an eerie study of a 
man, obaeued with failure and 
terrified of success, who seeks 
escape In the alter ego he 
creates out of his ventrilo-
quist's dummy _ The true magic 
of this film, though, lies in the 
stunning performance of An-
thony Hopkins as the schizo-
phrenic magician. 

Tbe plot focuses on Corky and 
his brash, obscene dummy, 
Fats; together they form a fast-
rising magic act. Corky soon 
finds himself on the brink of 
great success and he cannot 
cope with it. For a brief time he 
finds solace in his outside voice 
of Fats, through whom he is 
able to release his fears and 
anger. This, however, does not 
prove enough of an escape so he 

hides out in the countryside. 
Once in the country Corky finds 
a satisfyi", relationship with 
an old high school love, but even 
this happiness cannot destroy 
the nightmare world that Fats 
creates for Corky. 

Magie tells a thoroughly 
engrossing story but it also 
suffers from a couple struc-
tural flaws, such as an overly 
jumpy beginning. In addition, 
William Goldman. who adapted 
the script from his own best-
seller, does not give his lesser 
characters enough room to 
develop. These script defects , 
though, are not serious because 
the major focus of the film is on 
Corky , and here Goldman 
creates a fascinating and 
uncanny character. 

The film gre .. tJy benefits 
from Richard Attenborough's 
superb direction _ Atten-
borough, who started out as an 
actor, coaxes fine perfor-
mances from his cast: Ann-
Margret as the romantic 
interest is excellent but unfor-
tunately appears too briefly, 
and Burgess Meredith also does 
a fine job as Corky's agent Ben 
Greene. 

The film, however, belongs to 
Anthony Hopkins as Corky. 
Hopkins is an extremely gifted 
actor of the stage, Equus, and 
TV, QB VII , but Magic finally 
offers him a film role worthy of 
him. Hopkins dominates al-
most every scene, and he 
delivers an intense and in-
triguing portrait of a man 

Anthony Hopkins as a schizophrenic magician gives a superb performance in the movie "Magic," 
now showing at the Valley Circle Theatre.

The reaction of most Council

programs wasn 't racist; Sabo 
replied .. (Saltman) has those 
tendencies, but it's more a

Students of the Urban and Rural Studies Department will offer a one-day workshop which 
will p rovide a basic concept of ethnicity in the Social Sciences and a definition of 
ethnici within the community .. 

The Da -long conference will include the presentation of ethnicity workshops in the 
following areas; psychology, education, economics. sociology, urban and rural 
studies/anthropology, political science. and history. 

Throughout the day there will be speakers, such as Ruben Dominguez, Human Resources 
Administrator, San Diego County, and Art Goodman, Vice President, Economic 
Development Program, San Diego Urban League, supplementing each workshop with 
fresh viewpoints from within the community_ 

Competition for UCSD's pair

representing all districts of the 
Pacific Southwest, Central, 
Southern and Northeastern 
conferences will be vying for 
national honors. The top 25

By Sheri Tbomas

Greenburg. "Everyone en-
couraged each other. I'm really 
proud of the girls ." 

Possibly due to their over-
confidence, the girls were upset 
in the second and third games, 
but they managed to hold their 
opponents during the fourth 
game, 15-4. 

earlier in the week by tbe 
nationally ranked second squad 
from San Diego State Uni-
versity. "Ali I can say is that we 
knew they would be very 
tough, " commented Prather. 
"We were very psyched out in 
that match." 

SDSU experience and overall 

height advantage were the 
crucial factors in State 's 
victory, 1~, 15-11, and 15-4. 
While the Tritons fluctuate in 
height, SDSU maintains a front 
row with 5'U" to 6'0" team 
members. 

" We could've made up for 

their tallness with our de-
fensive play , " explained 
Ishihara . "Our strong defense 
kept us going in that match." 

Attributing to the defense was 
team member Cheryl Wright, 
who played last year against 
SDSU. 

"We played our best game of 
the year against Azusa Pa-
cific, " exclaimed Beth Prather 
of the women's volleyball 
team's performance last Fri-
day night. Although UCSD lost 
the match in five games, 15-5,0-
15,2-15, IH, and 1-15, tbe team 
displayed tbeir enthusiastic 
spirit once again in an intense 
batUe. 

"Tbe team played long 
ralUes for every point," said 
Coach Grace Greenburl, "We 
really jelled togetber and 
worked tolether in every sense 
to earn points." Tbe Tritons 
played expert defense and 
offense in tbe first game 
alainst AP, batUing to a ten-
point win. "We communicated 
well during that game," added 

"We had great blOCking and 
hitting play during that 
match," commented team 
member Ann Ishihara, "Sberri 
Lilley, in a large part, was 
responsible for our success in 
those games that we did win. " 
Lilley's efforts were also 
commended by Goach Green-
burg. Lilley aided her team on 
several accounts In the last 
game. Nevertheless, UCSD 
couldn't overcome their op-
ponent's successful drive .

mowed-down pasture," Skief 
remarked, "It is really hard to 
get good footing on this 
course." 

The mass start may not prove 
to be a problem if the Triton 
runners follow the strategy 
they've used all year. "Both . 
guys are fairly slow starters, 
usually they work their way up 
to the front from the middle of 
the pack." Jacobson admits 
that in Saturday's race he may 
have to alter his strategy and 

"start a little faster than 
norma!." 
Skief predicts that the win-

ning lime will ~ under 25: 20 for 
5 miles. Jacobson's season best 
of 26: 15 puts him in a large pack 
of other runners. "The runners 
from the Midwest will have the 
advantage," Skief commented. 

This race is very important in 
"determining the criteria that 
UCSD athletes have to meet in 
order to compete at the national 
level," emphasized Skier.

The women's swim team at 
USD is probably still wondering 
what hit them last Friday 
afternoon at their own pool. 
Coming out 'of the cold, wet 
conditions UCSD women ' s 
swim team romped over the 
weaker USD squad, 94-25, 
despite weather adversities 
and small starting blocks in an 
outdoor pool. 

"The '!Vhole team (23 girls) 
went and the whole team 
swam," remarked women's 
coach Diana Dann. "It was 
really an exciting meet for us." 

One of the highlights of the 
meet was a tie for first place in 
tbe 100 yard butterfly between 
two Triton swimmers, each 
swimming in the event for their 
first time ever. Shawn Blais-

University of Wisconsin, near 
Kenosha today. Their mission: 
To compete in the NA[A

ETHNICITY IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES 
Saturday 

I 

November 18, 1978 
........ 

at 
Third College Cafeteria, 

Patio, and Center for the People 
Students of the Urban and Rural Studies Department will offer a one-day workshop which 
will provide a basic concept of ethnicity in the Social Sciences and a definition of 
ethniCity within the community .. 

The Day-long conference will include the presentation of ethnicity workshops in the 
following areas: psychology, education, economics, sociology, urban and rural 
studi s/anthropology, political science, and history. 

t · 

Throughout the day there will be speakers. such as Ruben Dominguez, Human Resources 
Administrator. San Diego County, and Art Goodman. Vice President, Economic 
Development Program, San Diego Urban League. supplementing each workshop with 
fresh Viewpoints from within the community. 

Competition Cor UCSD's pair 
will be tough. Over 400 1'UIlDtI"S, 
representing all districts of the 
Pacific Southwest, Central, 
Southern and Northeastern 
conferences will be vying for 
national honors. The top 2S 
runners ' In the race will earn 
All-American status. 

Coach Skief says that he is 
•• asking Doug and Pete to finisb 
in the top SO. How well they do 
depends on the climatic condi-

. tions," Skief continued. "It's 
very . cold up tbere, they'll 
probably be running in gloyes 
and stoelting caps." At last 
report there was no snow on the 
ground, although it was near 30 
degrees at the race mte. 

[n his second trip to tbe 
nationals Jacobson, beeause of 
his experience, baa the edle.

during tbe race. 

All 400+ runners will be

Volleyballers Fall to #2 Ranked State 
By Sheri Thomas 

S&aff Wrller 
Greenburg . "Everyone en· 
couraged each other. I'm really 
proud of the girls." 

Possibly due to their over-
confidence, the girls were upset 
in the second and third games, 
but they managed to hold their 
opponents during the fourth 
game,lH. 

earlier in the week by the 
nationally ranked second squad 
Crom San Diego State Uni-
versity. "All [can say is that we 
knew they would be very 
tough," commented Prather. 
"We were very psyched out in 
that match." 

SDSU experience and overall 

height advantage were the 
crucial factors in State ' s 
victory, 15-6, 15-11, and 15-4. 
While the Tritons fluctuate in 
height, SDSU maintains a front 
row with 5'11" to 6'0" team 
members. 

" We could've made up for 

their tallness with our de-
fensive play ," explained 
Ishihara . "Our strong defense 
kept us going in that match." 

Attributing to the defense was 
team member Cheryl Wright, 
who played last year against 
SDSU. 

"We played our best game of 
the year against Azusa Pa-
cific," exclaimed Beth Prather 
of tbe women's volleyball 
team's perfonnance last Fri-
day night. Although UCSD lost 
the match in five lames, 15-5, 0-
15,2-15, IH, and 1-15, tbe team 
displayed their enthusiastic 
spirit once again in an intense 
battle. 

"The team played long 
rallies for every point," said 
Coacb Grace Greenburg, "We 
really Jelled together and 
worked tGtetber in every tense 
to earn points." The Tritons 
played expert defense and 
offense in the first game 
a,ainst AP, batUing to a ten-
point win. "We communicated 
well during that game," added 

"We had great blOCking and 
hitting play during that 
match ," commented team 
member Ann Ishihara, "Sherri 
Lilley, in a large part, was 
responsible for our success in 
those games that we did win." 
Lilley's efforts were also 
commended by Goach Green-
burg. Lilley aided her team on 
several accounts in the last 
game. Nevertheless , UCSD 
couldn't overcome their op-
ponent's successful drive. 

Swimmers Swamp USD 
in 94-25 Outdoor Victory 

The Tritons were defeated 

Championship ' Run 
(Coa&iDued from pa,e 1%) 
mowed-down pasture," Skief 
remarked. "It is really hard to 
get good footing on this 
course." 

The mass start may not prove 
to be a problem if the Triton 
runners CoHow the strategy 
they've WJed all year. "Both 
guys are fairly slow starters, 
usually they work their way up 
to the front from the middle of 
the pack." Jacobson admits 
that in Saturday's race he may 
have to alter his strategy and 

"start a little faster than 
nonna"" 

Skief predicts that the win· 
ning time will ~ under 25: 20 for 
5 miles. Jacobson's season best 
of 26: 15 puts him in a large pack 
of other runners. "The runners 
Crom the Midwest will have the 
advantage," Skief commented. 

This race is very important in 
"detennining the criteria that 
UCSD athletes have to meet in 
order to compete at the national 
level , " emphasized Skier.

The women's swim team at 
USD is probably still wondering 
what hit them last Friday 
afternoon at their own pool. 
Coming out 'of the cold, wet 
conditions UCSD women's 
swim team romped over the 
weaker USD squad, 94-25 , 
despite weather adversities 
and small starting blocks in an 
outdoor pool. 

"The '(Vhole team (23 girls) 
went add tbe whole team 
swam," remarked women's 
coach Diana Dann. "It was 
really an exciting meet for us." 

One of the highlights of the 
meet was a tie for first place in 
the 100 yard butterfly between 
two Triton swimmers, eacb 
swimming in the event for their 
first time ever. Shawn Blais-
dell, who is also a diver, and 
Bunny Stein turned in identical 
times of 1: 13. "That's a great

praised Dann. 

In the SO yard freestyle event 
DaDO entered five swimmers 
including first timers Martha 
Carey (34.0), Carol Del Vecchio 
(37.0). Conklin and 

Martha Smith (32.0) . The race 
was won by UCSD's Susie 
Zneimer in 27.9. 

In the individual medleys 
Chris Evans swam a 2: 30 in the 
200 1M, which Dano stated ,

Affirmative ction Needed 
Afflnnativ~ ~ction programs 

are needed, added Russell, 
because fon decades there 
existed in this country laws 
specifically designed to keep 
blacks out of traditional 
institutions, particularly edu-
cational institutions . Thus 
when black slaves were 
stripped of thei r African 
culture they were forced to 
form a new culture where 
scholarship had no value, he 
said.

locate and provide promising 
students with the social strokes 
and "affinnative action" or 
encou ragement needed to 
excell in the highly competitive 
academic environment. 

In response to the criticism 
that special admissions stu-

~nts are less qualified than 
their regular admissions peers 
both Russell and Byrd agree 
that what is relevant are not the 
student's abilities when he 
enters a school, but rather his 
abilities after graduation. 

For Russell, these objections 
specifically fail at two points. 
First, upon graduation, all 
medical students must pass the 
same examination in order to 
receive a license to practice, 
regardless of the rationale for 
their admittance to medical 
school. Secondly, special 
admissions students must be 
well qualified wheQ admitted 
since they are capable of 
passing the licensing exam 
after graduation, he said. 

EOP Office 
A difficult part of the Amr-

mative Action process aside 
from graduating students who 
enter under special admissions 
programs is finding students 
for initial admission to school. 

According to Byrd, UCSD's 
EOP office administers pro-
grams fiJlanced by several 
sources that contact promising 
minority and low-income 

students at the junior hiih 
through graduate levels and try 
to hold them till graduation. 

From registration fees, Byrd 
said, UCSD's office of EOP 
receives monies aimed at 
generating UC systemwide 
admissions requests from 
under-represented student 
populations. To this end, he 
explained, all nine UC cam-
puses cooperate together by 
splitting California into sepa-
rate territories. 

The EOP office, Byrd con-
tinued, has six full time 
recruiters who meet with high 
school and Junior College 
students and counselors from 
Redding to Yuma to discuss the 
UC system in general and 
UCSD in particular. Byrd 
pointed out, however. that the 
recruiters "don't stamp (the 
students) UCSD ." What is 
important, he stressed, is that 
"the recruiters just encourage 
students to go to college in 
general, whether UC or a JCor 
whatever. " 

Considerable Success 
The statistics Byrd quotes 

indicate considerable success. 
Out of a total undergraduate 
population of approximately 
8000 students at UCSD, 1269 
gained admittance through the 
encouragement or assistance 
of Byrd's EOP office. This year 
alone, recruitment efforts 
produced 973 applications of 

UCSD .Roars By USD 
94-25 in Swim Meet 
(Cont, from page 13) 
was "good for the conditions." 
The team's "oldster" at 21, 
Linda Buchanan, swam a 1. 11 
in the 100 1M, her first effort in 
the event. 

Dann had "everybody in the 
water" for the 200 yard free-
style relays. UCSD entered five 
relay teams, including the 
victors at 1: 54.4. 

"We're maintaining so far," 
commented Coach Dann on her 
team's progress. "This was our 
first dual meet so our times 

haven't dropped too much yet. 
Only by tenths of seconds here 
and there ." 

The women go on a road 
trip to Las Vegas today , 
taking on UN Las Vegas on 
Saturday afternoon at 3 pm. "I 
think they'll be a tougher match 
than USD but I really don't 
know too much about how good 
they are," said Dann. "They 
just started a women's team 
about two years ago and 
they've got some pretty good 
girls." .

which 664 were admitted . 
Of this group of 614 new 

students, 414 gained entrance 
through the normal UCSD 
admittance procedures. The 
remaining 180 students were 
granted special admittance. 

/ --.:. -
EOP Direc&or Bill Byrd 

Whether an EOP student 
enters regular or special 
admission procedures depends 
on whether a student has 
fulfilled the University's 'a' 
through 'f' requirements (basic 
requirements for high school 
academic subjects) , said Byrd. 
Those that have not are either 
directed to a JC or enter special 
admissions proceedures. 

Byrd also pointed out that 
once a minority or low-income 
student is past the entrance 
proceedures his involvement 
with the EOP of(jce is far from 
over. Frequently, Byrd said, 
the only person an EOP student 
knows when he first comes to 
UCSD is the recruiter who first 
contacted him. EOP solves this 
problem by helping new stu-
dents with their housing, 
financial aid and academic 
problems until they become 
settled, Byrd said. 

In this function the EOP 
office works closely with the 
Provosts and OASIS, among 
others, Byrd said. EOP will 
even help, Byrd stated. if a 
student wishes to change 
roommates. 

Pal1nershlp Program 
Besides encouraging high 

school and JC students to apply 
to the University, Byrd's office 
is intimately involved in two 
programs aimed at preventing 
disadvantaged students from 
dropping out before high school 
graduation. 

The first, which works with 
disadvantaged 7th through 10th 
graders and their parents. is 
known as the Partnership 
Program. According to B)'rd, 
the Partnership Program 
responds to the 40% drop-out 
rate among minorities between ' 
9th and loth grades. By pro-
viding some 3000 students at 30 
San Diego junior high school~ 
with careful motivation and 
role models, Byrd said, over 700 
of these students went on to 
high school who would not have 
otherwise. 

As we 11 as dea Ii ng with 
students, the Partnership 
Program also talks to their 
parents because, said Byrd, 
often "they may not under-
stand how important college 
is." Based on the success of this 
two-pronged attack, Byrd sees 
the Partnership Program 
expanding in the future. 

After students advance past 
the Partnership Program they 
are picked up by another 
statewide program that leads 
directly to the 12th grade 
recruitment program, at which 
point. if things go right, they 
continue through UCSD and on 
to graduate school. 

Devil Invades Ho~e; 
Makes Voice Heard 
(Continued from PIlle 8) 
she woke up to confront a 
mirror renection that had a 
startling resemblance to the 
Wicked Witch of the West. In 
this case hallucination could 
have been poISible, but every-
one in the family heard most of 
the noises that exuded from 
various and sundry corners of 
the house. 

Ronald DeFeo, one of the 
sons of the previous owners of 
the house, shot the six other 
members of his family In a 
mass murder. Afterwards he 
claimed that "voices" bad told 
him to do so. He is now serving 
six life 8enteDCe8. 

The Warrena are convinced 
that the Devil had invaded this 

. home. When the Lutz family 
left the house with only a few 
changes of clothes they had 
been convinced also. 

"Before the home wu eyer 
put 00 tbl. property . . , tbe 
Sheecock Indian. had an 
encionre wbere they kept the 
sick, the mad, the mentally ill. 
And yet, according to the 
records they would not bury 
their dead there, saying that 
the land w·as inhabited by 
demons ," explained Lorraine 
Warren. 

She also cleared up another 
point that Jay Anson makes in 
his book, The Amityville 
H?rror . "You 've read in the 
book where spirits can 't cross 
water," she said , "that's the 
most ridiculous thing in the 
world." For a spirit anywhere 
in the world "all we would have 
to do is give recognition to 
that .. . and it could be here." 

For someone who thinks that 

their house is "haunted," 
Lorraine Warren's advice is to 
contact "the clergy, in hopes 
that the clergy might be 
understanding of what took 
place, but.. .even if you felt you 
didn't have an open-minded 
clergyman ... probably the best 
thing to do would be to aks him 
to bless it, not even mentioning 
the fact that you believe the 
house was haunted ... and this in 
itself will be of great help In 
getting rid of what I. there." 

Upon beiDI BIked why be and 
bls wife bad remained un-
scatbed through 30 years of 
working. with thia .ubject, Ed 
Warren replied, "I feel that 
ever since I moved into the 
(baunted) borne, from (the age 
00 5 years old ... in Bridgeport, 
Connecticut, that I bave bad 
protection from the Bleued 
Mother, wbo I baYe lJ'eat faith 
In, Midlael the Arcbangel, and 
of coune Jesua Christ. 1 believe 
that our knowledge in this area, 
which has been acquired not 
through books, but tbrough 
being Involved over 30 years, Is 
wh~t keeps us going. " 

The Warrens have re<:enUy 
had a book accepted for 
publication . Says Lorraine 
Warren, "Our book will go into 
the psychology of the Devil -
cases like Amityville, the 
effects on people living there. 
the effects on people like 
ourselves who go into homes 
like that. 

"It'll go into cases of 
possession. into a great deal 
about our bacqround, (and) 
into haunting experiences that 
we have been involved in in all 
areas . "
