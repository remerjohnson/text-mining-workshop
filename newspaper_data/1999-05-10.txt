HANOVER, N.H. -
Dartmouth College has 
imposed a moratorium on the 
formation and recognition of 
any additional Greek houses. 
The moratorium comes in 
response to the Board of 
Trustees' social and residen-
tiallife initiative and will 
remain in effect until after 
the Trustees have decided on 
what the College's new 
social system will be. Acting 
Dean Dan Nelson said that 

. students are free to plan and 
take steps toward the forma-
tion of additional Greek 
houses, but that formal 
recognition and rights which 
go along with that would not 
be granted at this time. He 
also said students should not 
view the moratorium as any 
indication of what is in store 
as a final result of the initia-
tive.

Medical School Earns Grant 
HEALTH: NIH gives 
$5.3 million to study 
women's hormones 
By Vincent Gr.,nanl 
Senior Staff Writer 

The National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) recently granted 
UCSD a five-year, $5.3 million 
grant to study women's repro-
ductive health. The grant will 
transform the current 
Specialized Population Research 
Center into an NIH-designated 
Specialized Cooperative Center 
in Reproduction Research. 

The Specialized Population 
Research Center has been at 
UCSD for 20 years and its direc-
tor. Samuel Yen, a professor of 
reproductive medicine, will 
retire next month. Pamela 
Mellon, professor of reproduc-
tive medicine and neuroscience, 
will serve as director of the new 
center. 

Mellon said that although the 
old center was funded by the 
NIH, the new grant will give the 
center more money to work with 
and the ability to expand. 

The new center will study 
women's health concerns such 
as infertility, polycystic ovary 
syndrome and problems related 
to menopause. Mellon said that 
the new center will focus on 
problems in women's health that 

concern their hormones. 
Yen said that he is pleased 

with the new center and the peo-
ple who will be working in il. 

"The new Center for 
Reproductive Biology and 
Disease and its investigators are 
dedicated to translating basic 
researclr into clinically relevant 
treatments for a host of disor-
ders," Yen stated. 'The cohesive, 
interactive team will address 
women's health and disease, from 
gene expression and ceIl function 
to the reproductive system." 

Mellon said that the grant 
affects eight professors, all of 
whom have laboratories staffed 
with researchers at various acad-
emic levels. 

Mellon said that the new cen-
ter will include more modem 
technology than the current cen-
ter and will also include a new 
seminar series. 

Mellon said that the center is 
important because it will focus 
on women's health issues and 
involve collaboration' with the 
community. 

"In recent years there has 
been growing awareness of 
women's health as a specialized 
area of research as well as clini-
cal practice," Mellon stated. 
"This center will allow us to 
build upon the important basic 
and clinical research that has 
been under way here for many 

years, with the goal of better 
understanding all aspects of 
reproduction, in order to develop 
and improve upon treatments for 
disease. 

"In addition," Mellon contin-
ued, "this center will allow us t.O 
raise the profile of reproductive 
biology research in San Diego 
and increase communication and 
collaboration among experts in 
the field, to accelerate the pace 
of discovery." 

Melron said that the center 
will create a communication net-
work with local biotechnology 
firms , the Salk Institute and 
local hospitals such as the Navy 
Hospital, Sharp Hospital and 
Scripps Hospital. 

Mellon added that the collab-
oration will help increase the 
productivity of research. 

"It 's an educational program 
and a communication program 
that will allow us to synergize 
the research we do," Mellon 
said. 

Mellon said that UCSD lias 
one of the top five programs in 
reproductive endocrinology and 
that it will eventually interact 
with 15 to '20 other sites desig-
nated as cooperative centers by 
the NIH. 

Mellon added that after five 
years, .UCSD will attempt to 
renew its funding by reapplying 
to the NIH.

C.R.E.A.T.E. 
Director 
Appointed 
OUTREACH: Current 
co-director Hugh Mehan will 
serve as new leader 
By Jeffrey M. Barker 
Senior Staff Writer 

Applications from underrepresented 
students to UCSD will soar and college 
student will earn course credit for per-
forming community service if Hugh 
"Bud" Mehan has his way. 

Marsha Chandler, senior vice chan-
cellor of academ ic affairs, announced 
thaI Mehan, a sociology professor and 
director of UCS D's Teacher Education 
Program (TEP). wi ll be the director of 
the Center for Research in Ed ucational 
Equity, Assessment and Teaching 
Excellence (C. R.E.A.T.E.) last Friday. 

C.R.E.A.T.E. is a UCSD research 
center dedicated to the educational needs 
of underrepresented students. 

A nationwide search concluded with 
the appointment of Mehan as the head of 
C.R.E.A.T.E. He has been involved with 
educational issues at UCSD and at local 
K-12 schools long before the founding of 
C.R.E.A.T.E. and has served as its co-
director for the one and a half years it has 
exi ted. 

"The rea~ issue is gelling students 
from underrepresented backgrounds bet-
ter prepared to enter the uni versity," 
Mehan said. 

Mehan 's research has concentrated on 
Ihe achievement gap of minority and 
low-i ncome students. To close this gap, 
Mehan said there are four goals to work 
toward. 

He said the first goal for C.R.E.A.T.E. 
is to work closely with the UCSD 
Medical School to improve the health of 
studenls in C.R.E.A.T.E. 's partnership 
schools. The second goal is to enrich the 
academic environment at schools that 
have lower achievement records. The 
third is to emphasize parental involve-
ment which Mehan said is a very impor-
tant part of students' success. The fourth 
and final goal is to train and improve the 
ski lis of current educators. 

• Mehan said he is a strong advocate of 
offering course credit to students per-
forming community service. 

"A real key to all this success is get-
ting UCSD students involved in this 
enterprise," Mehan said. 

Mehan also added he wants to learn 
more about students' lives. Mehan said 
thatlhis year's decline in applicants from 
underrepresented backgrounds is "trag-
ic." He said there is a large pool of under-
represented students who are very close 
to being eligible for the university, but 
are missing something, perhaps conti-

Paul Drake, who has shared 

C.R.E.A.T.E.' director responsi-
bilities with Mehan. said that 
Mehan has been instrumental in 
developing partnerships. 

Mehan said that whether 
C.R.E.A.T.E. is successful in 
preparing more underrepresented 
students for university entrance 
wi 11 not be seen for four or Ii ve 
more years. 

"Academic preparation is unfor-
tunately a slow process." Mehan 
said. 

Until that time. Mehan said that 
C.R.E.A.T.E. will be looking at 
"benchmark measures" to deter-
mine thei r effects. Some such mea-
sures are an increased enrollment 
in Algehra I, considered 'a gateway 
course to more difficult collego.: 

C.R.E.A.T.E. look at San Diego's 
high school program, 
Advancement Via Individual 
Determination (A . V.l.O.). Much 
like C.R.E.A.T.E .. A.V.I.D. strives 
to better prepare underrepresented 
students for college entrance. 

Roosevelt senior ArLO Mansury, 
who has been working with Mehan 
since the summer of 1997 as 
C.R.E.A.T.E.'s undergraduate rep-
resentative, said that while she does 
not easily give her "stamp of 
approval," she ' is pleased to see 
Mehan appointed as the new chair 
of C.R.E.A.T.E. 

" He's passionate about educa-
tion - and that comes through in 
everything he doe ." Mansury said. 
"I couldn' t have been happier with 
the decisitJn."

parents versus a biological parent's right to privacy. 

Topics include the legal and social implications 
that will affect the adoption triad, the role of adoption 
agenCies and affiliated public institutions, and infor· 
mation for adoptive parents whose adult child is con-
templating a search. 

Birth mothers Darlene Gerow and Denise Garcia, 
adoptees Bill Lipis and Ann Wren, and adoptive moth-
er Patty Werdowatz will all speak at this presentation.

Advancements in genetics can 
save lives by providing 
organs and tissues 
By jennifer DeButts 
Staff Writer 

Cloning is no longer science fiction . First came 
Dolly. and within a few years there could be the first 
human clone (if someone has not secretly done so 
already). But before that day arrives. it might be wise 
to stop and evaluale thc consequences of cloning. 
That is. we should see how the petri dish affect s our 
culture. 

On the question of whether or not we should go 
forward with human cloning. thc answer is yes. The 
benelits of thi s new technology are well documented. 

The Korean Ttmes. for example. reponed in March 
that the cloning technology of xenoplantation could 
supply organs such as hearts. kidneys and li vers to 
those in need of transplants, which is .tremendous 
news for the 200.000 people expected to die this year 
while wai ting for an organ transplant. The 
Washington Post has also reported that cloning mam-
mal cells could be an eflicient means of producing 
human insulin for millions of diabelics. 

Addi tionally. cloning might help patients wi th 
Parkinson 's. Alzhei mer's and other bram diseases by 
providing them wi th neural ti ssue that is genetically 
idcntical to their own. Burn victims could receive 
son, new skin grown in a laboratory. while patients 
with myelogenous leukemia could gai n a reliable 
source of healthy bone marrow. which might eventu-
ally result in a cure. 

Combined with gene therapy, cloning may also 
make it possible for scientists to eliminate the trans-
mission of Tay-Sachs and other genetic di seases, 
which would save the li ves of millions of infants. 

Cloning also gives infertile couples the opportuni-
ty to have children of their own. 

Despite these tremendous scientific benefits of 
-cloni ng technology. the majority of people still har-
bor rcservations. These qualms. howe vcr. are due to 
negati ve portraya l' by sc ience fi ction, from Aldous 
Huxley's vision of a cloned race of sub-intelligent 
workers to the 1970 film "Boys from Brazi l," 
where clones of Hitlcr are raised secretly in the 
SOl::h American junglc. Comic books suggest the 
rise of slave clones or subhuman soldier clones. and 
si nister clones have also appeared in popular shows 
such as "The X-Files," which mi srepresent the tech-
nology as a "xerox ing" of human beings. 

This is one of the biggest cloning misconceptions 
created by science fi ction - the idea that human 
clones wou ld be identical not only physically, but 
also in per onality and behavior. Hence, opponents 
invoke a mental image of troops of clones ceremoni -
ously marching and chanting in unison. Yet . there is 
no reason to believe in these ni ghtmarish scenarios. 
for new technology frequently creates controversy: 
in-vitro ferti liza ti on. artificia l insemination and 
amnioccntesi were once t110Ught repugnant but now 
occur routinely and with little notice. 

Another misconception of cloning is that the tech-
nology may fall into the hands of dictators and othcr 
"evi l men" who cou ld continue their mulevolcntlega-

cie~ throughollt all of time. If this were true. then 
mankind shou ld quickly clone Henry Kissingcr and 
other great minds of our time in order to keep their 
intelligence alive for generations to comc. In other 
words, even if we could keep one mind alive indeli-
nitcly. we must not as~ume that it would have 10 be a 
bad per~on rather than a good one.

Cloning and genetic 
engineering have no 

apparent benefits 
By Shannon Castle 
Staff Writer 

Since the national media blitz following the arrival 
of Dolly, the cloned sheep, in 1997. the possibility of 
cloning humans has loomed large on the horizon. 
With this new possibility came new questions: What 
uses does human cloning have? What are the possible 
consequences of these uses? Will cloning humans 
help us or hun us'! Is it morally acceptable'! 

Closely linked to the idea of cloning humans is the 
po sibility of genetically engineering them. This 
involves a kind of mixing-and-matching of genetic 
material to produce desirable traits. Genetically engi-
neering humans would allow the formation of indi-
viduals with no genetic diseases or defects. and would 
also allow parents to "design" children with the 
"right" eyes, hair. height, sex, etc. 

Proponents of cloning and genetic engineering 
claim that advances in the field will allow a greater 
quality of life for humans. Suppon for this viewpoint 
ranges from the above-mentioned possibility of erad-
icating genetic disease to the possibility of cloning 
deceased children. In some areas. especially that of 
genetic di sease, genetic manipulation does seem to 
promise grcat results. In other areas, proposals for the 
use of cloning and genetic engineering border on 
lunacy. In general, the probable negative consc-
quences of the ability to manufacture people far out-
weigh its benefits. 

"Human cloning" is a term that refers to a number 
of proposed processes, including the growth of single 
organs as well as "c'lpying" an entire person. As it is 
used herc. in reference to the growth of a whole 
human being whose entire genome has been taken 
from another human. These two people. the "donor" 
and the clone, are genetically identical. This would 
most likely be accomplished by using a procedure 
similar to the one used to make Dolly. The procedure 
involves injecting the entire genome of an adult sheep 
into an egg cell from which the DNA was removed. 
This egg was then placed into the uterus of another 
sheep. and thus Dolly developed normally in utero. 

Some questions arise when applying the mecha-
nisms of cloning to humans: What could this do for us? 
How would human cloning benefit society, if at all'! 
The answer is that it presents no justifiable benclits. 

The Human Cloning Foundation 's web site 
(hltp:llwww.hllll1ancloning.org) presents case aftcr 
case in which human cloning would be desi rable; 
many involve the cloning of a lost loved one. The web 
si te docs ·admit, however, that no personality can be 
cloned. This is evidenced by identical twins, who ha~e 
exactly the same gcnelic material, but have unique and 
often very different personalities. Cloning a lost loved 
one, thcn, gives an entirely different person in an iden-
tical body. Thus, cloning would not be very beneficial 
or hclpfulto the people who are grieving. 

Another proposcd, albeit not well-accepted, use 
for cloning is of a human being for "sparc" organs and 
body parts. People seem to forget that a clone is as 
much of a li vi ng individual as anyone else. Thc vcry 
real possibility of "farming" people for medical use 
brings up a whole set of questions about the value of 
human life. If such a situat ion occurred, cloning 
would improve life. but only for those with power 
over the means of cloning. The quality of life for the 
clones might be much less desirable. 

Genetic engineering adds a new dimension to the pic-
ture. It would allow us not only to duplicatc humans, but 
to "perfect" them as well. This seems beneficial enough

CINCO DE MAyO DESERVED MORE RECOGNITlON 
Editor: 

Upon seeing the Thursday edi-
tion of the Guardian ("Cinco de 
Mayo" May 6). I was extremelv 
pleased to see a large picture of one 
of the child Ballet Folklorico 
dancers from the previous day 's 
Cinco de Mayo festivities on the 
front page. However. when I anx-
iously looked forward to reading 
the accompanying story, I was dis-
appointed to lind that there was 
none. 

This year's Cinco de Mayo <;el-
ebration was significant for a 
number of reasons. all of which 
the Guardian failed to inform the 
student body of. Besides obvious-
ly being the biggest and most suc-
cessful celebration in a number of 
years. it was also the first time all 
the Latino student organizations 
came together in a united coalition 
to put the event on togethcr. The 
political implications of this seem 
very obvious to me. 

Aftcr weeks of reading about 
petty cxchanges in e levators. I 
was extremely disappointed that 
no one on the paper 's staff took 
the time or elTon to find out any 
of the event 's nackground. If a 
reporter would have spokcn with 
anyone on the committee for even 
five minutes. I am surc th ey 
would have neen informed as to 
why the Latino community here at 
UCSD was especially excited 
about this year 's event. As far as I 
know. no one was ever 
approached. 

I believe proper recognition was 
not given to the event and the num-

ber of hardworking and dedicated 
organizations that was quite justly 
due.

Main campus Station 
Is the Way to Go 
Editor: 

In recent weeks, the issue of 
locating a San Diego trolley station 
on campus (or near it, at leas:) has 
again resurfaced. Except for one 
Guardian Opinion feature ("A 
Track for the Future" April 26), 
however, little support or di scus-
sion has been given publicly for 
anything except the administra-
tion 's choice of an east-of-the-free-
way station. In fact. the administra-
tion 's choice for an east side loca-
tion i patently inferior and their 
reasoning continually tlawed, com-
pared to other alternatives. 

The administration, and others, 
assert that by 20 I O. east campus 
will be much more developed and 
the "center" of campus will be 
located closer to 1-5 . While the for-
mer is true. the laller is absurd. 
Though it is true that the ';geo-
graphic" center of campus has and 
always will be near the freeway, the 
functional center will always be on 
main campus. we t of the freeway. 
The "center" of campus. where stu-
dents hang out between classes, 
where vis itors rest and watch the 
going-ons, has moved from 
Reve lle Plaza to the Student 
Center. now to the Price Center and 
Library Walk. This "center" wi II

cast. Think about it ... will the "cen-
ter" of our campus ever be the mid-
dle of a freeway? 

As east campus develops. none 
of the uses there will ever cause that 
side to dominate ovcr main campus, 
and never will more potential riders 
for the trolley come from East rather 
than West. By 2010, East Campus 
will have the Preuss School (all stu-
dents bussed in and out equals no 
trolley riders), an expanded 
Thornton Hospital (continually 
underused equals few trolley riders). 
and a science research park (possi-
bly some trolley rider '). The mai n 
trolley riders from east campus wi II 
come from undergraduate and grad-

uatc housi ng. Now. in 2010. what 
will main campus bave? Well , just 
25.000 students. six or seven col-
leges, RlMAC, expanded Price and 
Student Centers, Geisel Library. as 
well as the majority of all student 
housi ng. Naturally. most trolley 
users will come from main campus . . 

Some, such as Jeffrey Barker, 
say that students won't ride the 
trolley. On the contrary. students 
are one of the demographic groups 
most likely to ride public trans-
portation, such as the trolley. We 
are already on tighter budgets, have 
more Ilexi ble lifestyles and, being 
younger, physically more able to 
walk to and from transit. 
Considering all of the parking . 
headaches recently. the trolley 
would be welcomed by many stu-
dents to help them get to and from 
classe ' and activities. 

Despite all of the advantages 
that the trolley would bring, the 
administration is insisting on plac-
ing thc station in a remote location, 
by Thornton Hospital, that will 
lower ridership and campus use of 
the station. It is we ll known to tran-
sit planners that ridership shoots 
down when peoplc have to walk far 
(such as across a freeway) or trans-
fe r to another servicc (such a a 
shuttle) to get to where they ' rc 
really goi ng. namely, main campus. 
That is why. despite the ad ministra-
tion 's insistencc on an east side 
si te, trolley planners continue to 
study on-campus alignment s that 
would have better ridership level. 
With all of the obstac les facing an 
eastern locat ion. people wi II just 

rather drive. 
Administrators. however. give 

nothing but excuses as to why a 
station can't be placed in main 
campus. " It will interfere with 
research." they claim. But. of Ihe 
top ten federally-funded research 
universities (UCSD is number 
three) half have trains running near 
or right through campus (all but 
one underground) and two others. 
including us, are considering them. 
'That looks like research and trains 
actually can mix to me. Studies 
done by trolley engineers con-
firmed that surface and under-
ground trolley routes could reduce 
vihrations to acceptable levels. 

Unlike our line instituti~n , the 
University of Utah is actively wel-
coming a light rail line. like (he 
trolley. to come to [itsl campus. 
Administrators there are planning 
three or four stations on-campus, so 
that they can relieve their uni versi-
ty's parking and traffic problems. 
Administrators here should begin 
to see the trolley as an advantage. 
as the University of Utah does, and 
shou Id work for a trolley that, i r not 
brought fully lontolmain campus, 
should at least come to the west 
side of the free~ay, as trolley plan-
ners decided in 1995. Instead. they 
insist on seeing it as a disadvantage 
- to be shoved into a remote cor-
ner of the campus - and lose such 
a great opportunity to act ually 
solve some of our schoo l's prob-
lems, instead of making thcm 
wor e.

the incident took place, and I 
remember that an angry male caller 
managed to place all of the blame 
on the harmful effects of single 
mothers and homosexuals ... keep 
in mind that at the time. no one 
knew anything about the two 
shooters. let alone their family 
structure or sexual orientation. 

Now, however, the focus on 
cause has shifted to the trench 
CO<l ts the two boys wore 
throughout high school and 
were wearing on the day of the 
murders. It seems that all of the 
news reports refer to "the trench-
coat Mafia" and "the trenchcoat 
killers." Perhaps thi s article of 
clothing is becoming linked with 
the very idea of murder and may-
hem - if one was to go by the 
media repons, Harris and Klebold 
were certi fied nut cases not 
because they shot a hell of a lot of 
people, but because they wore big 
black coats and looked a bit 

spooky. 
Of course, it gives the story 

such a dramatic touch to keep harp-
ing on the trenchcoat factor. It 
makes the killers seem more dark 
and chilling (as if they weren ' t 
already?), si milar to Leonardo

shooting people while clad in black 
coats. 

One can almost imagi ne the 
news editors and TV producers 
telling their staffs, "Hey, that 's a 
great angle! Keep mentioning the 
'ominous' trench coats ". and the 
black clothes! Make sure you talk 
about the black clothes as much as 
possible, too!"

Medical division ~ THE PRINCETON REVIEW 

And now, the result is trenc coat 
hysteria : black trench-coat-wearing 
kids are being condemned because 
of their clothing choices. Surely 
there are some sick litt le punks out 
there who might consider it 
absolutely hilarious to sudden ly 
start wearing a big black coat just 
to freak everyone out at school. but 

the public needs to ca lm down, 
take a deep breath and remem-
ber that clothe ' are just that -
clothes. 

Black clothing, after all, is 
not an outward symbol of men-

tal instability - it 's 'a fashion state-
ment. I once went through a phase 
where I wore only black year-
round, and somehow I managed to 
pull through without causi ng 
myself or anyone else physical 
harm. My dad was a loner-type 
who wore a trench coat in high 
school . as well, and I doubt that 
anyone ever felt that his clothing 
choices made him a possible killer. 

After witnessing the horrible 
events at Columbine, it 's a natur-
a l reaction to try to explain how 
seemingly normal kids can turn 
on their peers. However. the 
worst possible reaction is exactly 
th at whi ch is occurring: the 
media. schools and parents are 
hysterically condemning the 
trench coats and black clothing of 
other teens. 

Banning these i n' t going to 
stop the next schoo l shooting. 
however; Homicidal maniacs can 
create ju ,t as much mayhem and 
murder while dressed in school 
uniforms. By succumbing to 
trench-coat hysteria and treating 
any and all misfit kids like poten-
ti al murderers, the same sort or 
mi strust and victimi zation that 
Harris and Klebold accomplished 
at Columbine Hi gh School is 
being continued.

scientific advancements, it has enormous 
potential for misuse. If we decide to cont rol

Imagi ne the first day of classes 
for fall quarter. We're all standing 
in line outside Groundworks, wait-
ing for the books for our interesting 
classes and thinking that in some 
parts of the world "fall" refers to a 
season, not a quarter. We make 
sympathetic conversation with fel -
low students and look around at 
some representatives of the student 
body. Some of us look and think, 
"Wow. How long ago was it that I 
had that kind of youthful opti-
mismT' 

I'm not saying that I' ve lost my 
youth, but I have taken the longer 
way around when it comes to my 
higher education. I started out at 

my first college right out of high 
school. I even had a bunch of AP 
credi ts to jump start my matricula-
tion. Unfortunately, I finished up 
my first semester with a stack of 
medical bills and the decision to 
take a semeste[ to recover. 

Having 'lost my scholarships for 
the time off, I went to my second 
college as a pan-time student and 
came close to a degree in dance 
while I was supposedly continuing 
my literature major. I spent signi fi-
cantly more time in the studio and 
at my job than I did studying for 
my general education courses, and 
time slid by me. 

Three years after high school 
graduation, I visited a friend in San 
Francisco. Within about three days, 
I decided to move there and after a 
summer back home raising moving 
funds. I had a Berkeley address. I 
got an office job, went to a lot of an 
shows at the Califomia College of 
Arts and Crafts and drank red wine 
at dinner parties. 

I flew down to San Diego on a 
family mission to visit with some

Basically, my friends worry when-
ever I go anywhere new that they ' ll 

be receiving change-of-address 
notices in the near future. 

Somewhere along the way I 
ended up at UCSD with a cenain 
new status: "non-traditional stu-
dent." Personally, I like being con-
sidered non-traditional because of 
my stunning individuality - not 
my age. But hey, labeling is "in" at 
UCSD. 

Being "non-traditional" (though 
only by a couple of years) I find 
myself making comparisons 
between who I was eight years ago 
and who I am now. I find myself 
wondering what the hell I have to 
show for )!ight years that must have 
been chock full of opportunities. 

I'm always amazed that it 's 
been that long - yet high school 
memories seem rea lly di stant. I 
know I'm a completely different 
student than I was when I first tried 
to do the whole college thing, but

Welcome to the 12th Annual 
UCSD Undergraduate / 
Research Conference. 

The purpose of UCSD 's AnnuaL Research Conference is to 
recognJze the outstanding scholarly work produced by our 
undergraduates and to stimulate additionaL interaction between 
students anq faculty at the research Level. Another goaL is to 
encourage more undergraduates to pursue doctoraL degrees 
and careers in research and college teaching. 

A total of 94 students will' be presenting papers at the 
conference this year. All participants have been nominated 
by a member of the faculty who has judged their work to 
be outstanding. All students will be awarded a certificate 
as a research scholar. 

The conference is organized into 15 small roundtahle 
discussions. At each roundtable, five to seven students will 
present their papers with one or more faculty members serving 
as moderators. Each student has 15 minutes to discuss his 
or her paper and 5 minutes to answer questions. After all 
presentations are completed, there will be additional time 
for group discussion . Students will present their paper! at 
either a morning or afternoon roundtable. During the 
sessioll when they are not presenting, students will attend 
a roundtable of their choice as a member of the audience. 

This conference was made possible by generous support 
frol/1 the Vice Chancel/or of Student Affairs, Joseph Watson,

PSYCHO THERAPY 
The slow pace of a Comm major is actually the smarter route 

MARY HIGGINS 
Senior Staff Writer 

killing machine, designed fo r only 
one thing" (uh ... killing?) and "It 
eeks and destroys" (wouldn 't that 

be two things?). I know, r know ... 
everyone"s a critic. 

OK, one more gripe before I 
start issuing my weekly pearls of 
wisdom. You may have read Jake 
"Bucket" Gordon 'S sports column 
las t week, which analyzed the 
much-hyped Koala v. GlIardian 
sloshball tournament. Now, let me 
start by saying that Bucket is a 
man of many talents - he's a 

hit the ball. but I almost made it to 
first base. 

r was also a star when we took 
to the field. Hovering somewhere 
between first and second, I was 
never actually called upon to par-
ticipate (I made sure of this by cov-
eri ng my face and diving to the 
ground every time the ball headed 
toward my highly cherished teeth) 
but I cleverly hurled insults at the 
Koala staffers as they barreled past 
me around the bases. 

I think I made Tulley Rafferty 

et's evil twin Travis "Coach" Hill. 
Last week things got a lillie ... 
competitive. 

It was the night before the 
midterm, and I was frantically 
photocopying 90 pages out of Bar-
ber's reader when Bucket, Coach 
and I decided to combine forces 
and study together. This is the 
Universal Law of Comm: "Thou 
shalt not study in advance ... thou 
shalt run around the night before 
trying to mooch the reader off of 
your classmate, then study mania-

ion (I read the first and last para-
graphs of each article). Bucket 
brought up the rear by taking a 20-
minute trip to the water cooler then 
burying his nose in last month 's 
copy of Sports Illustrated. Ten 
hours later we found ourselves 
pulling a "Tulley Rafferty" -
regurgitating the entire contents of 
our study binge into our blue 
books. 

There are only two things I did 
last week worth mentioning. Fir 't, I 
went to see "The Matrix," so I'd 
like to brielly vent about that expe-
rience (don't worry, I won't give 
away the extremely lame ending). 

I want to applaud the Valley 
Guy/Shakespeare-loving actor 
Keanu Reeves - he made it all the 
way through the film without say-
ing "Bogus!" or attempting to 
recite his lines in iambic pentame-
ter. 

In "The Matrix," Keanu departs 
from his usual California-surfer-
with-a-deviated-septum shtick and 
tackle his Tole as a pasty-faced-
computer-eng i neer-wi th-a-dev i at-
ed-septum. The transformation is 
amazing and I'm really not being 
sarcastic ... r heard rumors that 
Reeves ac tually spent two weeks 
locked in the basement of AP&M 
learning to program in Pascal in 
order to prepare himself for the 
role. 

This is the Universal Law of Comm: "Thou shalt' not 
study in advance '" thou shalt run around the 

night before trying to mooch the reader off of your 
classmate, then study maniacally until you wind 

up face dotun in a puddle of drool. " 

Before I reveal the results of our 
exams, let me start out by saying 
that at the time 1 felt 1 deserved a 
higher grade than Bucket and 
Coach. OK, so maybe we all stud-
ied equally poorly and maybe they 
attended the same percentage of 
lectures that I did (approximately 
6%). I still considered myself more 
deserving than those guys .. . I'm a 
slacker too, but at least 1 feel bad 
about it. At least I kid myself by 
vowing never to procrastinate 
again. Bucket and Coach, on the 
other hand, have a serene accep-
tance of their binge-and-purge 
study strategy. All of us are slack-
ers, but the difference is that I used 
to be a nerd, so 1 still feel 1 should 
be achieving A's even though I 
can't even recall the name of the 
course. 

Indeed, the acting was the least 
of the film 's problems. The major 
Ilaw was the script, which supplied 
such gems as: " It' the ultimate 

good writer and a good hiller -
but Bucket has a lousy memory. 
After taking one too many pitches 
to the head, he apparently suffered 
from a mild case of amnesia and 
careless ly left out my own out-
standing contributions to Team 
Guardian. 

Allow me to elaborate. Arriving 
just in time for the last inning, I 
played ferociously with the 
courage and strength of a lion 
(despite my nearly incapacitating 
fear of gelling smacked in the face 
by the ball). Not only did I actually 

cry, although other players reported 
that he was not doubled over in 
tears, but merely barfing up the 
contents of six or seven cans of 
really crappy beer. Anyhow, shame 
on you, Bucket, for forgelling your 
MVP (Most Valuable Psychothera-
pist). 

Perhaps I'm just bitter, though. 
You see, Bucket and I have a 
comm class together along with 
several other Gllardiall veterans: 
Graphics Editor John "I have a 
thing for penguins" Barber, Senior 
Staff Writer Scott Yager and Buck-

in a puddle of drool." Some people 
make fun of comm for being an 
easy major and to this r counter, 
"You think it 's EASY cramming 
live weeks worth of reading into

So anyway, the three of us sat 
around shooting the breeze for a

The sun is in Taurus all week 
long, good for making solid deci-
sions and falling madly in love. 
That 's especially likely on Monday, 
with the moon in Pisces. Dreams 
will be allainable then, or at least 
they'll look like it. On Tuesday, the 
moon goes into Aries, causing us 
all to take spontaneous action, a 
feeling that continues through 
Wednesday and into Thursday. By 
late Thursday, we' ll all realize we 
need to get more practical, and 
that's the theme that pervades 
through Friday. Put off imponant 
decisions until then, if at all possi-
ble. Saturday and Sunday are your 
best days this week for communi-
cations, especially if money is 
involved. 

ARIES

advice, however. Something you

live impact on your financial situa-
tion.

academic life seemed so bad when 
I considered the alternative. 

The biggest difference between 
then and now is what motivates me. 
My parents are still pleased and 
proud when I do well, but this is 
my undertaking, for better or 
worse, 'til death or graduation do 
we part. The effort is mine, the 
stress is mine, the debt is mine, the 
glory is mine. I take it all both more 
and less seriously than I did at 17. 

Of course, there are some social 
ramifications of my status as well. 
There are days when I feel old. 
There have been lower division

that specifically illuminated the age 
gap. Every once in a while 1 talk to 
someone and think, "Wow, you're 
18 aren't you?" And of course my 
best friend tells me I'm old on a 
fairly regular basis, just in case I 
forgel. Thanks Jess. 

I've been at parties where the 

cops show up to tell everybody to 
quiet down and I find myself hid-
ing out in the back. Years ago it 
would have been because I was 
underage. Now I worry that as one 
of the only people of age, 1 could 
get charged with contributing to the 
delinquency of minors. 

Take all of that and try dating. 
Nobody bats an eyelash if a guy 
dates a woman who is five years 
younger, but flip that around and 
some people might cllll it "socially 
inappropriate." Some friends of 
mine do. 

All in all, I'm glad I had the 
time and the,c;xperiences that I did. 
I would tell, any graduating high 
school senior to take a year off first 
because the experiences of life out-
side of academic circles will shape 
you and teach you and expand 
those horizons everybody keeps 
talking about. Sure, I occasionally 
get the voice in my head that says, 
" If you 'd just gone straight through 
... " but I don't tend to give that 
thought much attention. I may have 
a few things I'd forget if I could, 
but I 'd never go back to change 
them.

MARY: 
OUf MVP! (Most 
Valuable Psycho) 
ContInued froIII ...co 12 
Coach got an A, the bastard . 
When 1 saw our grades, I initial-
ly felt cheated I 

Then I had an epiphany of 
sorts. I realized that all of my wor-
rying and stressing did not help to 
improve my score. I realized that 
the sports guys are not lazy bums 
at all , they are geniuses! They 
have grasped the Meaning of Life: 
have fun, study minimally, enjoy 
life, relax. 

While everyone else is sitting 
like a zombie in lecture, they 
occasionally by-pass campus alto-
gether and head for a Padres game 
or Vegas ... and they still have 
damn decent GPAs! They lead 
good lives. I've realized that I ' m 
not resentful of them at all .. . I 
admire them. 1 want to be like 
them. After all, if the world were 
to be vaporized by a giant asteroid 
tomorrow, I wouldn't want to 
spend loday biting my nails over 

some midtenn. 
The moral of the story is this: if 

you ' re lucky enough to be a 
savant like Coach and Bucket you 
can get away with being the 
Slacker King. Anal retentive peo-
ple like myself should learn to 
accept this and stop guilt-tripping 
ourselves into lots of pointless 
studying. Slacking really can pay 
off, unless you are (a) not intelli-
gent enough to "wing it" or (b) are 
hell-bent on becoming a brain sur-
geon or some other insanely 
demanding occupation. 

There are plenty of good rea .. 
sons for slacking. Stress-free peo-
ple have more friends, lower 
blood pressure, a better sex life 
(be honest, when was the last time 
you felt like making out right 
before your o-chem midterm?) 
and more lime for recreation. I'm 
not saying that over-achievers are 
bad - they just need to get a little 
perspecti ve, 

I still take bio classes from 
time to time and half of the pre-
meds in those lectures don' t even 
LIKE whatlhey study. My point is 
this: if you are busting your butt 

\ 

FEATURES 15 

over your o-chem books, I hope 
that at least you're enjoying it. A 
little hard work won't kill you, but 
being miserable might. 

When she's not playing soft-
ball, or frantically studying COI/I -
munications, Mary is busy think-
ing of ways to finish up her colum-
nist career. For those of ),011 who 
want to contact Mary and tell her 
what you think of her column 
before she retires at the end of the 
year, drop off a letter upstairs at 
the student center, or e-mail Mary 
at mhiggins@ucsd.edu.

heresy. I have Ii mited recall of the 
glory that transpired on Saturday so 
all that is written are statements 
pieced together after a night of wild 
claiming that followed the event. 

We set up camp to the south of 
the main trai l. This was not an easy 
task as the maneuverability of two 
full kegs down a sheer cliff as well 
as arm fulls of hot dog buns. salsa, 
tortilla chips not to mention our 
surfboards, wet suits and towels. 
required the grace of a mountain 
goat and the might of the World 's 
Strongest Man. 

Once si tuated, we were con-
fronted with another setback: The 
tap was broken. Despite a valiant 
effort from an engineering student 
- from here on known as the 
Ladies Man - the tap was stuck. 
Needless to say. we were a 
resourceful and thirsty group, so 
we came up with an ingenious 
solution: shake the keg. We shook 
the keg with fervor and 10 and 
behold the beer flowed and the 
contest could go on. 

Origi nally. the contest was 
goi ng to be a tag- team event. There 
was tea m Shores. team Poole 
Street, team Bitter, team Valley and 
team Old Guys. But once the drink-
ing ensued. such coordination 
proved to be too dirticult. so we 
resorted to an individual. winner-
take-all format.

The alumni, coming in after 
back-to-back nights of belligerence 
- they say they party more now 
than when they were students -
seemed to be in good trai ning. So 
did team Valley, who were espe-
cially amped, donning duct-taped 
boards claiming "East of 1-5." But 
then again the members of team 
Shores. team Poole Street and team 
Bitter. were more than ready as 
well. 

Only time and two kegs would 
tell who would eventually win "El 
Campeon" - the coveted Beer 
Open championship mug. 

The contest got underway at 
noon. Six hours. two keg shells, 
five account of puking, one set of 
lost keys. one broken board and 
one finger badly bitten by a rabid 
squirrel later, the champion was 
crowned. It was Keith E helman,

ing his board. Their request was 
granted and a beer was run over to 
the contestant, who by then was 
staggering in the white-water. He 
grabbed the beer and began pound-
irig. Mid-beer, he bent over and 
puked it up - we believe it was 
due to our diet. fueled by salsa on 
hot dog buns. The crowd booed. He 
resumed drinking. By beer's end, 

the alumnus had puked not once, 
not twice. not thrice, but four times. 
He headed back into the surf with a 
frothy ring of beer-foam and barf 
around his mouth. 

Another glorious endeavor was 
the sand-battle between Douglas 
and Frenchie. Frenchie had earlier 
suggested, to no one's approval, 
that the contest be po tponed -
the weather was bad and the surf

was too big. Douglas was an out-
spoken opponent of the French 
man 's idea. The conniet later tran-
spired into an epic sand-duel, and 
Frenchie was last seen being 
chased to Scripp by a crazy drunk 
guy threatening him with a lengthy 
lump of kelp. 

While Frenchie was avoiding 
seaweed, Charlie was frolicking 
with the squirrels. We were set up 
at the base of the cliffs where the 
happy rodents make their home. 
Charlie had befriended the squirrel 
earlier and earned its trust with 
handfuls of tortilla chips. Call it a 
love bite, or at best a slight misun-
derstanding, but t~ little guy 
snapped at Charlie's finger, draw-
ing blood from both sides: A sec-
ond Beer Open ' wounded soldier. 
But Charlie, also part of team 
Valley, sucked up and continued to 
drink and surf in stride. 

The judges were al 0 entertain-
ing. Justin, sidelined with a broken 
wrist due to an earlier skating acci -
dent, was the most reliable beach 
marshal anyone could ask for. He 
was the ultimate beer-getter, mak-
ing sure nobody entered or exited 
the water without a cold one, and 
also made sure that the heats got 
otT on time. 

Pi. pair 'of judges were a equally 
dedicated to the cause as beach 
marshal Justin was. The twosome 
had to go to the bathroom really 
badly during one heat, but they did-
n' t lose focus. Rather. they 
remained in the judges' chairs and 
pissed their wet suits without miss-
ing a single wave, all the while 

Monday, May 10, 1999 

laughing as a hot trail of pee 
drained from the ank le cuffs. 

Similar heroic and entertaining 
acts took place in the water as well. 
Ladies Man hobbled ashore after 
losing his board to a set wave. He 
pounded a beer without hesitation 
and little protest. Peter got sea-sick 
while Big Dave pulled into a barrel 
and Douglas earned bonus points 
for his unparalleled grace while his 
6'8" frame and 7'2" board went 
over the fall s. I struggled in my 
heat, but received some consola-
tion points for at least paddling for 
a wave. 

But Keith 's story was the best. 
In the finals alone Keith proved 
why he deserved to be crowned "El 
Campeon." During the 30 minute 
heat, he drank si x beers and got a 
handful of waves - more than 
anyone else. His sixth and final 
beer came with seconds to go and 
ended up becoming the deciding 
factor. He drained it, then collapsed 
in the sand. Waves washed over 
him as the crowd ran to crown him 
champ. 

Nobody could have asked for a 
better Beer Open. Frenchie was 
right : The weather was bad and the 
surf was big. But when you're 
drinking and surfing with friends, 
new and old, sunshine goes unno-
ticed. And large surf - even when 
you're drunk and swimming for 
your board because you don't have 
a leash - is never something to 
bitch about. So for Keith and the 
rest of us who drink beer for break-
fast , the Beer Open will always be 
peas and carrots.

POLO: 
Tritons tough it out 
at Nationals 
ContInued from ..... 20 
Tritons wa finished, immediately 
putting them in the losers bracket. 

The Tritons' second game on 
Friday was against No. 13 
University of Maryland 
strangers to the UCSD women's 
water polo players, having never 
played them in season game . In 
the first round, Maryland had lost 
to UCLA, 12-2. so the Tritons went 
into the game with confidence. 

Maryland started strong, and 
ended the quarter ahead two goals. 
In the second quarter, however, the 
Tritons stepped up offen ively and 
brought the score to a familiar tie, 
2-2.

left New Jersey a winner. 

The victory of their last game 
faded fast as the Tritons went up 
against a strong San Jose State on 
Saturday. Earlier this season, the 
Tritons took the Spartans into 
overtime at the UC Santa Barbara 
Invitational. but fell 5-4. 

In the consolation-round match 
on Saturday afternoon, the game 
started fast with 3 goals by SJSU 
in the tirst quaner. countered by 
UCSD's single tally. The second 

quarter was a stalemate, as no 
team scored, and the game stayed 
at 3- 1 at the half. Both teams man-
aged to put 2 goals apiece away in 
the third quarter. keeping the con-
test tight up until the final quarter. 

However it was in the fourth 
quarter that the~Spartans pulled 
way ahead, leaving the Tritons 
down and out. The Tritons' I goal 
cold not match the Spartans ' 5 
final quaner goals. 

Freshmen Erin Welsh and

one goal against SJSU, as did

potentially hazardous acti vi ties 
in the annual Beer Open.

a few of the guys li vi ng on 
Poole Street created the first-
ever drinking and surfing 
marathon. From there. the Beer

Open is run in heats. We had 19 
students and alumni signed up 
so we ran four first-rou nd heats 
lasting 20 minutes made up of 
either four or five men (no 
women signed up). The top 
three men in each heat advanced 
to the semi-fi~al s . The two 
semi-final heats were extended 
to 25 minutes due to the 
increased intoxication, The top 

, three surfe rs, rather, drinkers 
from each of the semi -final 
heats advanced to the finals for 
a 30 minute showdown, 

ow that you have the 
basics, let me give you the 
details. Unlike conventional 
surfing conte t where a surfer 
is rewarded for the quality of his 
turns, a Beer Open surfer is also 
rewarded for the quality of his 
drinking. 

Before each heat begins. all 
surfers have to pound a beer. 
The one with the quickest draw 
and the least amount of spillage 
is awarded two points and is 
judged on four waves instead of 
three - a considerable advan-
tage. 

Once in the water, a surfer 
can paddle in to pound a beer, 
Doing so earns the surfer 2 
additional points. 

The last twist, and the one 
that makes this event so unique, 
is the use of leashes. They are 
not allowed, 

Now with the groundwork 
set in place, let us move on to 
the nilly gritty. Of course from 
here, I must admit that all infor-
mation that follows is mere

The UCSO women's water polo 
team put up a tight thi s weekend at 
the 1999 Women 's Collegiate I 
Water Polo National 
Championships, hosted by UC 
Davis. Entering the competition 
seeded 12th, the Tritons fell to 
Uni vers ity of Hawai i in the tirst 
round of games, then rallied to beat 
Maryland in the second round, end-
ing Friday 's games, 

Saturday, the Tritons lost to San 
Jose State sending them into' an 

eventual rematch with Long ~each 
State on Sunday for 11th place. 
Unfortunately, the Tritons, fell to 
the 4gers, but not without a 
tight. 

The Tritons 
have had a 
tough hi story 
with Hawaii , 
having lost to 
Rainbows at the start ·of the 
season in two away games. But in 
these pair of games, the Tritons 
were without senior hole defender 
Jenny Irwin, who was unable to 

play to because she was in swim 
season. As a re~ult, the Triton 
defense suffered and the Rainbows 

crushed the Tritons in two 
brutal games, the final 

score for the 
tirst game was 
17-6, and the 
second 14-4. 

Twenty -s ome 
games and a season of 

improvement later, the Tritons 
proved how far they've come in 
their first game at Nationals against 
Hawaii, The Rainbows stepped 

Tritons' Title-Hunt Lives On 
TRIO: Olsen, Nguyen and Tadlock continue the challenge at Div. ill Nationals 
By Jake Gordon

After a tough loss, the only 
thing to do is put it completely out 
of your mind and start fresh . That 's 
what UCSD women's tennis 
players Kirsten Olsen, Maria 
Nguyen and Lyndsay 
Tadlock had to do 
this weekend. 

Everything was 
peachy after the 
Tritons beat Mary 
Washington College (Va.) 
last Tuesday to advance to the 
round of the NCAA Division III 
Women 's Tennis National 
Championships in Ewing, New 
Jersey. But the team 's tournament 
wa brought to an abrupt end on 
Wednesday with a tough loss to 

eventual National Champion 
Amherst College (Mass,), 

After the close defeat to the 
undefeated "Beast of the East," the 
Triton's top players had to shift 
gears and clear their minds to play 

10 the singles and doubles 
part of the champi-

onships. This 
strategy worked 
for some, but not 
for others. 

The No. I singles 
player for UCSO the past 

two seasons, Olsen was unseeded 
going into the singles competition, 
but apparently someone forgot to 
tell her, The Triton sophomore 
ripped through her first round 
opponent, Wendy Floering of 
Denison University (Ohio), in 

straight sets 6-3, 6-0. Yet she was-
n' t done. Apparently, advancing 
past the first round just wasn't 
enough for Olsen, 

Saturday afternoon, Olsen pro-
ceeded to upset Mary Missbach 
from University of the South again 
in straighl sets 6-4, 6-4. Missbach 
was the sixth seed entering the 
tournament, but Olsen sent her 
packing. 

The next round was played late 
Sunday with Olsen facing her best 
challenger 10 date, top-seeded 
Jamie Cohen of the feared Amherst 
College. Not only did Cohen lead 
her Jeffs to the National title right 
through the Tritons to cap off an 
amazing 20-0 season, but she did it 
by easily besting Olsen 6- I. 6-0

ahead during the lirst quarter with 
two goals, but the Tritons checked 
them in the second quarter, ending 
the half with a 2-2 tie, Freshman 
Emma Kudritzki and senior 
Kathryn Ozaki scored the two 
goals that brought the Tritons to a 
tie with Hawaii. 

The Rainbows tipped the scales 
however in the third quarter to end 
the scoring for the game, and leav-
ing Hawaii up 4-2. The fourth quar-
ter was empty, no goals from either 
team, and the first game for the
