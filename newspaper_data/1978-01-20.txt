Space: the final frontier. 
As the technological eye of 

man probes into the complex 
nature of the expanding 
universe, a vast history is also 
revealed. Galaxies, as they 
appeared lO billion years ago, 

re expected to be observed in 
what Rirhard Harms, assistant 
research physicist in the UCSD 
physics department, calls " the 
most exciting thing to hapen in 
a tronomy in the 1980s." 

Harms, the principal scienti-
fic investigator of a team of 

CSD cientists, will supervise 
the design and construction by 
the Martin Marietta Corp. of a â€¢ 
700 pound faint object specto-
gra ph under a $10 million 
contract from the National 
Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration (NASA) as part of the 
Space Telescope Project to be 
launched in 1983. 

Space history 
Because of the time it 

req uires light to travel 
through space, scientists will 
be observing the history of 
galaxies and the universe, and 
information is expected to be 
gained about the evolution of 
each. Curiosity will a lso direct

At last week's AS Council

Dave Eisen asked a series of 
questions concerning a new 
campus telephone counsel-

Eisen most about AS funding 
for the service, he said later, 
was the lack of information 
th council had about 
campus counseling services 
in general.

"Happy Hours" to happen at 
campus beginning this spring 

by Andy Schneider 
Associate News Editor 

"The Chancellor has approved the concept of 
a beer pub on campus," AS Muir Representative 
Gary Moser recently announced. 

Located in the Student Center's Building C, 
the new pub will share space with Future Foods 
Restaurant. Scheduled to open Spring Quarter, 
the new facility "will provide a gathering place 
for faculty , students and staff. It will be a social 
center that draws people together," said Moser. 

Through the campus Purchasing Office, the 
pub will be contracted out to a local business 
which in turn applies to the Alcoholic Beverage 
Control (ABC) board for the license to serve 
beer and wine. 

Objecting to possible enforcement problems 
and legal questions, similar plans had been 
routinely rejected by the Vice-chancellor of 

tudent Affairs' office during the last ten years. 
The effort to change campus policy was 

directed by an AS Task Force appointed by 
President Jeff Leifer and chaired by Moser. 
" the results of a research report showed that UC 
Irvine, UC Davis, and UC Berkeley all had set 
precedfent with successful arransements. If 
they could do it , so could we," Moser said. 

Moser continued to explain that the 
independent contractor becomes responsible 
for checking age indentification. Although the 
contract will be designed to meet UCSD's 
specifications, it probably will be closely 
patterned after Berkeley's well known Bear's 
Lair. 

"When you come down to it, students pay a lot 
.ot have the Student Center. Why not fill some of 
the space with a pub where people can meet and 
be in a relaxed atmosphere? Our primary 
concern is student community, " Moser said. 

Next Friday the AS plans a " T.G.I.F. with 
beer", on the lawn in front of the Student Center. 
Both Student Center Director Maggie Brown 
and Assistant Vice-chancellor for Program-
ming have approved a proposal for the one-day 
liquor license. If the application is accepted by 
the ABC, beer will be included with the GIber 
refreshmenu plaODed. A band for the twill

deliberation for the commit-
tee. 'I Due to the allegations that 
have been raised, Sindler feels 
that "we (the committee) have 
to clear the air" and lay the 
matter to rest. . 

The committee has not yet 
begun work on the inquiry 
because they claim they have 
been too busy. 

The allegations against 
Drapeau concern two occasions 
on which he rented car while 
on AS business attending 
Regents board meetings in San 
Francisco (Triton Times, Nov. 
30) . The money was used to pay 
the bills came from Drapeau 's 
External Affairs budget. 

The AS has not yet ct up 
guidelines for expenditures 
from AS budgets and is , 
according to Leifer, operating 
under what are popularly 
known as " Regents ' rules ." 
The Regents ' rules concerning 
travel state that the least 
expensive method of trans-
portation must be used . 

The allegations of misuses 
stem from the fact that public 
transportation was available to 
Drapeau and would have been 
less expensive. 

Cour t. 
Credit for work 

Of fu r t her im por t to the 
students was the agreement by 
the defendant (the Regent of 
the Univers ity of California) 
allowing credit for all academ-
ic work by plaintiff Patton for 
all quarter 1977, and also the 
granting of a retroactive leave 
of absence for plaintiff 
Rhomberg during fall quarter 
1977, and a refunding of all of 
his paid fees for that same 
quarter. 

Also announced at the pres 
conference was the joining of 
five additional students to the 
original three (Susan Erzinger. 
th third plaintiff, was to b an 
entering freshman to the school 
last fall ) . 

Robert Arenz, Tfe-Ling Fong 
and Eric Riedel have placed 
their fee in trust with Joan 
Patton. Don trebel has ent hi 
fee to C Pre ident axon. 
while L w Goldberg's fee wer 
given to Chancellor William 
McElroy. 

Arrangements are now being 
mad by the plaintiffs to hav 
the e fee also placed in th 
court tru t. It i expected that 
even more students will join in 
placing th ir fee in tru tat th 
beginning ofthe pring quarter. 

The Counsel for the Regent 
will respond to the complaints 
of the plaintiff on February 15.

Ab rtion lawsuit 
"good" issue 

The lawsu.lt over campus abortion policies recently brought by 
three students represents what we in the newspaper business call 
a good issue. Its implications are varied and potentially far-
reaching. It is not a simple two-sided issue on which people can 
take easily-reduced positions, but rather a complex, highly 
emotional problem that can readily set best friends at each others' 
throats. 

The lawsuit was filed by students who feel they shouldn't pay for 
the mandatory health insurance policy because it includes 
abortion coverage. The students, all Catholics, who say they are 
forced to fund abortions through the health plan, and that violates 
their religious beliefs. The university says the students can't 
enroll for classes until they pay their fees. 

There are many implications involved in the lawsuit, not all of 
them immediately apparent. A partial listing includes: 

-the effect on campus health insurance and abortion policies. 
The most visible of the implications, this portion of the lawsuit 
could mean an end to both mandatory health insurance, which now 
costs students $13 oftheir Registration Fees, and, atthe very least, 
to the inclusion of abortions in the policy. 

-an answer to the question: Why is health insurance a 
mandatory part of the reg fee? Acting Vice-chancellor of Student 
Affairs Howard Hunt says students in the past decided the policy 
should be mandatory, but students here now don't seem to know 
when such a decision was made. One apparent reason for a 
mandatory plan is that otherwise the UCSD policy would not 
include enough money to make it as far-reaching a plan as it is 
now. But students should have the right to decide. ina referendum 
this spring. 

-the effect on UC's fee structure. This implication could easily 
have the most far-reaching effects of any part ofthe lawsuit. IUhe 
judge rules that the students do not have to pay for the .health 
policy, it would open the door to the destruction of mandatory UC 
Cees. And , iUhe mandatory fee structure is shot down, no one could 
really expect the state Legislature to pick up the added tab. 

-an answer to another question: Why do so many abortions take 
place through the campus health plan? Though no one seems able 
to pinpoint the exact number, 250 is apparently a good guesstimate 
for how many abortions UCSD students helped fund last school 
year. Why . then, did the 3500 women students here need so many 
abortions? University women are supposed to be among the most 
educated people around. If they need approximately one abortion 
for every 14 women, something is wropg in the sex education 
classes around the country. 

Obviously, the abortion lawsuit is also a controversial issue. 
That point has been emphasized time and again this year for staff 
members at the Triton Times . The day after our first story about 
the anti-abortion students ran in September, two people {rom the 
Women' s Center came to our office to protest the story's 
placement. The women felt that , if the story should have been 
published at all , it should 've been placed at the bottom of the page 
or, probably, beneath the c1assifieds . The women believe the three 
students filed the suit only to bring publicity to the pro-life cause. 

UCSD administrators also have had problems with the issues 
raised by the lawsuit . Both Associate Vice-chancellor of Student 
Affairs Rick Whitehill and Hunt, are very reluctant to discuss the 
case's specifics, because they might be called as witnesses in the 
court case. 

Campus health center director Robert Allen doesn't want to 
talk about the issue at all. Soon after he explained the abortion 
process to a reporter earlier this month, he phoned back. and 
asked that he not be quoted by name. Even though he said nothing 
of substance as Car as opinions are concerned. Allen said that 
because of the lawsuit he though all attributed quotes should come 
from one source, such as the student affairs office . AI\en 
threatened to deny he had ever talked to the Triton Times if he was 
quoted by name. 

Despite all the hooplah in official circles surrounding the 
lawsuit, a vast majority of the student body is apparently still 
unaware of the case, or at least of how it could affect them. If they 
ever become aware of those implications , the campus could be 
torn in hal f. as students f actionalized over the va rious facets of the-
case. However. considering the somnolent nature of UCSD , I doubt 
that very much.

What Pabst and Plato could never do 
Burke ignores essential experience 
Editor: 

Mr. Ted BlRe's naive and callous cClTWJlentary 
concerning Cmstians in the Triton TImes (Jan. 13, 
1978) requres an expose. After readin, the anicle a 
couple of times I sou,ht to uncover in it the natlre of 
Mr. Burke's ,rievance. That is. what really caused 
him to respond so v.ehemenUy to the ",oapel" 
presented him by some old friendJ? If his response 
had simply issued in a rejection of what they 
presented. that would have been acceptable . 
However. their presentation appeared to be the 
"breaking straw." What followed in print was an 
onslau,ht of insults decorated with philosophical 
prose hardly recognizable as meaningful 
journallsm. 

After further consideration. three things became 
obvious to me. 

First o( all. Mr. Bwice is suffering fr(J'll severe 
poverty of fundamental political understanding. He 
states that his "annoyance" canes not fr(J'll what we 
as Christians believe but in Olr act of believing . 
Specifically. that adherents of the faith feel c~npelled 
to sll'ead "the wml" and "sucker in asmany gullible jerks as possible." Does sll'eading "the w<rd" by 
speaking annoy Mr. Burke? Does using one 's mouth 
to pass on to other human beings the testimonial of 
one's consW1lT\3te human experience bother him? 

If I may quote fran the 1st AmenOnent o( the 
Constitution of the United States of America, " .. make 
no law respecting an establislwnent of religion. IX' 
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; a- alridging the 
freed<rn of speech. IX' of the press ... " Is it not ironic 
that the very Constitutionalll'ovision fa- Mr. BlRe's 
freedom to comment is that which guarantees to 
Christians the freedom to speak concerning the 
faith? It is more than embarrasing for a journalist to 
be caught in this kind of error. 

Secondly, Mr. Burke clearly possesses zero 
knowledge of what constitutes being a Cmstian. He 

sardonically throws out plrases such as ..... chronic 
lack of inalination.. .. .. .vacant eyeri and vacant 
brained ... ... . wasted thtmselve . .. .... etc. Once again 
Mr. BlRe needs s<rne basic education. Has he 
forgotten the Reformation and its consequences? Has 
he never heard of Luther, Wesley IX' Whitefield? Does 
he not realize the Jrincipal f<rce which 1I'0peiled the 
Ref CITIlIItion out of the Dark Ages was the mass 
ll'inting of the Bible and its distribution to the cClTWJlon 
people? Without the Refmnation Mr. BllIite might 
weU be today a member of an iWterate servile class of 
people . Wake up , Mr. 8urit:e, out of YOIr altnitted 
drunken stupa-! Was the Reformation and what 
followed the wa-k of "non-imaginative". "vacant 
brained" men whose lives you have categaically 
labeled as "waste?" 

These men like all ~enuine Clwistians are sinple 
hlmllns who have receIVed into thtmselves the liCe of 
God. This is regeneration a-to be " bcrnagain ." Tobe 
a Clristian is pre-eninently a matter of entering into 
this experience . 

FinaUy, Mr. BlRe has revealed his own spiritual 
misfcrtune by openly confessing his preference to 
retreat into a poetic abyss he has col\iured up fIX' 
himself fr<rn the wens of T.S. Eliot . Karl Marx and 
Friedrich Nietzche. It is reaUy pitiful that a man has to 
slllVive on such shallow experiences as canbined 
inebliation (on beer. no less) and philosophical 
nmination. Far wcrse is the juvenile mplication that 
since this is his highest experience. nobody else could 
possibly have a more meaningful one. 

In conclusion Mr. BllIite. it must be stated that we 
Clwistians refuse to have our speaking quenched by 
sloppy. rhetmcaljournalilm. The gospel will continue 
to be verbally sll'ead as it has been fIX' 20 centuries. 
The personal experience of its content brings hlmllns 
into a ream of existence that "Pabst and Plato" never I 
could!

Comment on UCSD politics 
Editor: 

This is a response to Stadler's article in the Friday. January 13 issue. 
Were I free to choose a headline for my letter, it would read: "Senior 
Editor" Stadler: Can ' t tell his AS from a hole in the ground. But I won 't be 
surprised if another headline is used. because for years now it has been the 
frequent practice of the amateur yellow journalists running the Trite On 
Trash to attach a headline which discredits the author, rather than 
represents the content, of any letter disagreeable to the Trash world view . 
Similarly. if key words or sentences are botched or omitted, or if my 
punctuation is or syntax is altered to the point where my intended 
expression is lost, I won 't be surprised. 

A pathetically disillusioned Mr. Stadler asks, " What can we really 
expect from the AS? " A year ago. supporters of the Student Cooperative 
Union explained exactly what to expect. based upon UCSD's previous 
experience with an impotent. corrupt AS. We also based our predictions 
upon an historical analysis of student movements and of the functions and 
power structure of universities in modem monopoly capitalist countries. 
Of course, I know these subjects are way beyond Mr, Stadler's present 
intellectual development. but perhaps he may be persuaded to read at 
least aD introductory text like David Smith's Who Rules tile Universities . 

Stadler fantasizes that "During the five years since the last AS, 
administrators grew into the habit of ignoring student government when it 
made decisions." The fact is that administrators implement the 
"decisions " (read; "recommendations") of student councils or 
assemblies only when they agree with the students. The only exceptions to 
this rule: (1) outside liberation. such as a court order, or (2) when students 
are organized and united enough to apply massive pressure and protest. 

Such militance. not student governments. was responsible for the 
abolition of restricted "visitation hours ' between the sexes in the 
donnitories . Such militance won students the right to free speech on our 
campuses - rallies and information tables were, until very recently. 
punishable activities. Many of the rights , services and options students 
have today are the fruits of hard struggles waged by our predecessors. 

Stadler doesn't believe this . To him it's just a matter of " reason and 
accountability" residing or not residing in the student government. The 
administrators love this sort of distracted stupidity. As long as a 
substantial amount of student body attention is focused on criticisms of a 
relatively powerless student council or student assembly, no real progress 
(in terms of concessions from the administration) toward more 
democratization of the university can be expected. 

For years now. the TT has criticized student "government" much more

UCSD 's JV basketball team 
is playing strong fundamental 
winning basketball. The team 
has won four straight games 
before losing a close encounter 
to Long Be ac h State on 
Wednesday. The Tritons, who 
have jelled since the quarter 
break, have combined a strong 
offense with a tenacious zone 
defense. 

King Wayman substituted 
freely throughout the game and 
was very pleased with the 
overall performance of his 
players. Wayman was espec-
ially high on freshman guard 
Tony Filer who fed off for six 
assists.

mnth game of the season. 77-54 . Trailing 
~-30 at half-time. Cunningham noted. " We 
J~st ran out of gas . We've been playing 
tired. both at practice and in games." 

In explaining the loss. Cunningham said 
" There's a lack of execution or 'game: 
slippage.' We 're not executing in games 
like we do in practice ." No execution 
combined with a thinned out roster' 
dropped the Tritons' overall record to 4-9: 
Joe Greenstein led UCSD with 12 points 
while Peter Volk, Bart Bradley and Tom 
Omalev each chipped in 10 . Cunningham 
says he 'l run a ball control offense to 
regulate (and s low down) the tempo of the 
game. "A perfect game for us would be to 
win 38-31. "

WIll not be the consensus choice to repeat 
as conference titlist. The Lancers lost four 
starters (Micnael Ja ckson, Rommie 
Rogers, Stanley Oldham and Clarence 
Brown) from their 76-77 team. The four 
were dismissed from school for their roles 
in numerous cam pus burglaries . 

Point Lorna looks like the class of the 
Southem Divi ion, having compiled an 11-
4 mark this year. UCSD and Cal Baptist 
will most likely fight for second and third 
place , followed by Southern California 

Forward Paul Gardener, 
center Tom Polk and forward 
AI Jacobs make up the heart of 
the Triton offense. They have 
accounted for over sixty 
percent of the scoring in the 
first six games. The addition of 
6'6" Mark Runyan on perma-
nent basis will make the Triton 
front line one of the strongest in 
the junior varsity ranks. 

The Tritons have lost their 
two games by a total of only 
three points. A few missed field 
goals and an inability to hit 
consistently from the free 
throw lire have been the road 
blocks to a perfect record. 

Following is a summary of 
the Tritons' last three contests:

Tom Polk had another fine 
game lor the Tritons. He led all 
scorers with 28 'points while 
pulling down six offensive 
boards. AI Jacobs (I? points), 
Paul Gardener (17 points) and 
Ron Samuels (12 points) all had 
strong offensive games. 

Long Beach State 65 UCSD 63 
UCSD lost their first game of 

the new quarter to a very strong 
Long Beach State squad. The 
contest remained close the 
entire evening as neither team 
could pull away by more than 
four points. 

With two minutes left to go in 
the game it was still anyone' s 
ballgame. The Tritons were 
down by three , 61-64 , when Ron 
Samuels went to the line for a 
one and one free throw 
situation. Although only 
shooting 60% on the year he was 
able to hit the two crucial free 
throws to put CSD back by 
one. Or. the next play, a Long 
Beach State player was called 
for charging and UCSD 
regained posses ion withjust54 
seconds left to play . The Triton 
were unable to duplicate their 
amazi ng comeback of Friday' 
game , however . as Ron 
Samuels missed an off balance

tried desperately to signal his 
players for a time out but 
Samuel s s hot was history 
before it was acknowledged.

Wilder strikes again 

by JW LoalIe Bueley 
ArtsWfller 

"The World's Greatest Lover" is a lood old 
faabioned boy gets Iirl-boy loses girl-boy leta 
lirl back 88ain romance, a film made fllDDY by 
writer/directorlstar Gene Wilder's typical 
sl,-htly offbeat, slapstick-type humor, and 
sullied only by a little too much intellectualiza-
tion here and there. (Before this, the last movie I 
saw that didn't bowl me over with meuap was 
"For the Love of Benji"). 

''*W. ~." â€¢. 1171 

The messa,e in this case has to do primarily 
with acting, but Wilder executes quite a few 
pointed attacks on the film industry and ita star-
makin, apparatus as well. Making something of 
a case for method acting, the impossibly inept 
Rudy Hickman becomes a stardom-bound Rudy 
Valentine and proves he can only act 
convincingly as the world's greatest lover when 
he is actually suffering an emotional upheaval, 
which is always conveniently occuring just 
before a screen test. The coup de grace comes 
when Rudy, awarded the title of the world's 
greatest lover by a motion picture studio that 
has tested thousands of men not ~uite so sexy as 
he, announces, " This is not real ,' and with tears 
in his eyes, rides out of the soundstage to pursue 
his estranged wife, who is traveling by train to 
Milwaukee. Naturally, the horse catches up 
with the train ... 

_ ............ 

Lover" are over-indulged and over -
intellectualized, but the pathos approaches the 
Chaplinesque in a fine and commanding way. 
This is a very funny movie, sometimes wry, not 
too terribly vulga r, and not too terribly silly . It is 
also very sad. Sad and funny at the same time. 

Rudy Valentine simply cannot act; in fact, he 
habitually sticks his tongue out whenever he 
gets nervous. The character only succeeds to 
stardom by his honest emotion, by his caring for 
another human being . It is this type of 
sentimentality that I think Wilder is 
particularly good at expressing. The slapstick 
routines and the jok~ in " The World's Greatest 

But "The World's Greatest Lover" is still 
over-indulgent, which is a common naw in films 
written, directed and acted by the same man. 
We all think ourselves a wee bIt funnier than we 
actually are . The indulgence to beat all 
indulgences , however, is that Carol Kane, who 
plays Rudy 's wife, looks like Wilder (she's 
prettier, though) and acts like Wilder. It's 
almost as if Wilder were playing all the roles , as 
well as doing everything else; in this movie, the 
world is Wild~r and he is his own greatest lover.
