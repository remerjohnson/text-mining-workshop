While owning a smartphone may 
prove distracting during lecture, 
UCSD students now have no excuse 
to avoid doing research. The librar-
ies recently released mobile version 
of their website. 

The new site allows any owner of 
a high-tech mobile phone to navi-
gate library resources and informa-
tion through faster-loading websites 
better suited for a mobile device.

The website, which can be 
reached at www.libraries.ucsd.edu, 
will automatically direct the user to 
a more streamlined version of the 

library website when accessed on 
any mobile device with a browser.

Although the speed of the mobile 
website is weaker than that of a 
computer browser, the mobile web-
site is dependent on the carrier of 
the mobile device and the strength 
of the connection. 

The front page of the mobile 
site contains six clearly visible icons 
users can choose. 

Once a user clicks one of the 
icons, the website directs to a page 
with information organized in a 
simple list format. 

Using this mobile site, smart-
phone users can look up hours for 
all-campus librarians and access 

tools ranging from indexes and 
archives to periodicals for every 
area of study. 

Other features include maps and 
directions to each library and con-
tacts specializing in the category of 
the request (i.e. by subject area of a 
research topic or by library).

The website also features the 
“Ask a Librarian” service, through 
which students can directly com-
municate with a UC librarian about 
research or library-related inquiries 
through chat, text message or a 
phone call.

To increase access to California’s 
higher education system, Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger signed 
two bills — SB 1440 and AB 2302 
— last Wednesday that guarantees 
admission into the California State 
University system for community 
college students who complete a 
restructured transfer degree.

“It’s a step in right direction 
toward making a four-year educa-
tion available to many more students 
who might not have the opportuni-
ties given to them earlier on,” Warren 
Senator and transfer student Maclen 

Zilber said.
Transfer Senator 

Adam Powers, who is 
the only other transfer 
student involved in A.S. 
Council, agreed.

“Any bill that streamlines that 
process [and] any bill that makes 
it so that if you go towards … the 
transfer certificate — that is really 
good news for me,” he said. 

Under SB 1440, which is also 
known as the Student Transfer 
Achievement Reform, California 
community college districts are 
required to set up associate degrees 
for transferring to a four-year uni-
versity, in addition to establishing 
guaranteed associate degree for 
transfer students with junior status 
for the CSU pathway. 

Under this bill, which was writ-
ten by State Senator Alex Padilla 
(D-Pacoima), California commu-
nity colleges are also responsible 
for limiting the number of required 
course units to reduce unnecessary or

When Carol Padden saw a missed call from an unknown number on her video relay phone, she thought noth-ing of it and left off calling back until the next day. 
But when the phone rang again with the same number, Padden 
answered and received news from the sign language interpreter 
that would change her life. 

Last Tuesday, the UCSD communications professor and sign 
language scholar was awarded a $500,000 MacArthur Foundation 
Grant for her “creativity, originality and potential to make impor-
tant contributions in the future.” The MacArthur award, often 
called a “genius grant,” is a no strings attached reward to be used 
however the recipient wishes. 

“The person identified himself as from the MacArthur 
Foundation, and I thought at first that they were calling to ask 
me to write a letter for them,” she said in an e-mail. “It caught me 
entirely by surprise.”

This year, Padden is one of 23 researchers nationwide to receive 
the award for her work, all of whom were chosen through a series 
of anonymous nomination by peers.  

Padden has worked in the UCSD Communications Department 
since receiving her doctorate in linguistics here in 1983. She cur-
rently teaches courses to hearing undergraduate and graduate 
students on topics ranging from mind and culture to language 

globalization. Because she is Deaf, Padden uses an interpreter who 
speaks as she signs. 

The researcher bases her career on “the study of sign languages 
and what they teach us about the nature of human languages.” 

Eight years ago, Padden accidentally discovered a new sign lan-
guage in a Bedouin village that had existed for about three genera-
tions. She has watched as it developed sentences, words and complex 
grammatical structure out of hand and body gestures. 

Seeing this kind of language evolve all on its own allowed 
Padden and her colleagues to “test theories about how a symbol 
emerges, is conventionalized and then spread throughout a com-
munity to become a part of a larger language system,” as well 
as “develop artificial language models to compare with what we 
observe emerging naturally in a community.”

Her other groundbreaking work includes research on language 
building in communities, as well as looking into finger spelling as a 
means of increasing literacy in young, signing Deaf children. 

Padden has also received acclaim for her work on sign language 
syntax. Her dissertation, for example, suggested  that ASL uses a 
three-part pattern of plain verbs, special verbs and agreement verbs, 
clarifying misconceptions about the grammatical use of visual space.

Padden was born to Deaf parents, both members of the Gallaudet 
University faculty, and attended a school for Deaf children until she 
switched to a special program for hard-of-hearing children in the 
third grade. This early exposure to both the hearing and non-hearing 
world was a major catalyst for her current work. 

“I’ve always been interested in human language in general, and 
sign languages, specifically,” she said. “Communication is funda-
mental to my life, and it is natural that I would be drawn to the 
study of communication and language. I see my job as describing 
how language can be both unusual — as a sign language — and 
natural, as all human languages are.”

Although Padden admits that maintaining relationships with 
sign language users in exotic places can be challenging, she hopes 
to continue working in the field in the future and to continue her 
travels in hopes of better understanding other signing cultures. 

Padden has not said what she plans to do with the large and 
unrestricted MacArthur Foundation grant, but the magnitude of the 
award itself is a sure sign that silence is indeed golden.

available on the computer brows-
er, users may appreciate that the 
design of the mobile site allows 
pages to load much faster than the 
computer browser version, which 
may be sluggish when accessed on 
a phone.

The site was developed by User 
Services Technical Analyst Dan 
Suchy and Web Technical Manager 
Matt Critchlow. 

They observed a need for stu-
dents to access the UCSD Library 
resources via mobile phone and 
developed the project idea in 
January and February of 2010. 

Suchy and Critchlow decided to 
create this project because of the 
high volume of traffic the library 
website experiences on a daily 
basis. 

More than 7,300 people visit 
one of the university’s nine libraries 
and the website receives more than 
87,500 hits. 

“We knew that the mobile 
site was needed a long time ago 
because most students on campus 
do have a smartphone … and the 
mobile site is accessible through 
any device with a browser,” Suchy 
said.

It was this ubiquity of smart-
phones at UCSD that tuned Suchy 
and Critchlow into the demand 
for a convenient virtual bridge 
between the libraries and a prod-
uct that the majority of students 
already use in their day-to-day 
life. 

“We noticed that [students 
have] an increasing standard for 
this technology, because most on 
campus constantly have a mobile 
phone in hand … so the project 
was about plugging into their life-
style,” Critchlow said. 

Critchlow and his team created 
the coding for the website. The 
site, which took approximately 
two months to construct, was pre-

sented to staff in August and made 
public on Sept. 22. 

The website used in-house 
library staff and resources for 
funding and did not require out-
side contributions.

“We definitely had ‘streamlined’ 
in mind for the design,” Suchy said. 
“We did a bit of research, [and 
adapted into the site] what we knew 
other universities had to offer, and 
integrated the information we felt 
most users would desire, such as 
library hours and research tools 
[i.e. article databases for a variety 
of studies].”

Although Suchy and Critchlow 
have received mostly positive feed-
back from the colleagues since the 
official release of the mobile site, 
they are planning to assess it in 
greater detail this coming spring by 
evaluating students’ reactions to the 
program. 

They also welcome student 
feedback via a link in the mobile 

site (under the “contacts” icon) 
and hope to integrate the site with 
the existing UCSD mobile web-
site and application for iPhone and 
Blackberry. 

Suchy and Critchlow also 
emphasize that a library catalog is 
currently under construction on the 
mobile site, and will be debuting 
later this fall. 

The catalog will condense the 
UCSD Libraries’ resources and ser-
vices and will allow users to find 
and request library items by subject 
title, author title or keyword. 

“Obviously nothing will replace 
actually going to a library and talk-
ing to a librarian,” Critchlow said. 
“But the mobile app and ‘Ask a 
Librarian’ simply offer users dif-
ferent venues through which the 
UCSD librarians can be accessed.”

excess coursework. The law requires 
CSUs from requiring additional 
courses beyond 60 units juniors need 
to obtain a bachelor’s degree.

“Part of my long stay at communi-
ty college was due to the fact that the 
requirements were not entirely clear 
for community-to-college transfer,” 
Powers said. “It’s very, very easy to get 
stuck taking classes without knowing 
if they’ll be instrumental in getting 
you into CSU.” 

About 73 percent of California 
college students attend community 
colleges. 

However, 22.7 percent of those 
who intend on transferring to a four-

year university follow through with 
the plan, according to the Institute 
for Higher Education Leadership and 
Policy.

The second bill, AB 2302 
by Assemblyman Paul Fong 
(D-Cupertino), adds to SB 1440 by 
calling for a transfer pathway to the 
UC system as well as for CSUs. 

The pathway would also provide 
a transfer with associate degree and 
system admission.

“It’s good step forward overall,” 
Zilber said. “I do worry that we could 
get to a point where [there is a] 
devaluing of those degrees, but I do 
think that making [the transfer pro-
cess easier] is a good move for the 

system.” 
States officials estimate the new 

law will save about $160 million a 
year since transfer students cost less 
to subsidize than freshmen. They also 
estimate the bill will help 40,000 com-
munity college students on their way 
to a four-year university. Currently, 
an estimated 50,000 community col-
lege students transfer each year.

This year, UCSD enrolled a record 
number of 2,943 transfer students out 
of the 14,286 who applied for this fall 
quarter. 

This is approximately 1,000 (or 
33 percent) more than last year and 
three times the number enrolled in 
1999. 

The trend of enrolling more trans-
fer students has been increasing. 

According to Zilber, the freshmen 
to transfer student ratio has been 
steady at about 3:1.

“We deliberately made the deci-
sion and are trying to increase the 
number of transfer students we 
accept,” Admissions Director Mae 
Brown said in a statement. 

In efforts to diversify the student 
body, the admissions office turned to 
community college applicants, who 
are more diverse in race, age and 
income.

BumpyÊRide

I entered UCSD as a transfer stu-dent, so I wasn’t quite as wide-eyed and enthused as some of the 
freshmen straight out of high school. 
And instead of having my parents 
pack the family minivan with all my 
worldly belongings and drive off into 
the sunset, I began my journey by 
boarding a blue-and-white shuttle bus 
from the east parking lot. 

Since then, every ride has been 
the same. I flash my ID card and nod 
in recognition to my sleepy-eyed 
shuttle driver as I step onto the aisle 
way and stumble into a seat. The 
first time, I couldn’t help looking out 
the window to stare at my car, sitting 
alone like a neglected puppy in the 
East Commuter parking lot. “Don’t 
look at her, Mims,” I told myself. 
“You’re on the shuttle now. There’s 
no going back.” 

Despite the $549 I shelled out for 
a parking permit, by the time I arrive 
on campus at noon, finding a parking 
spot on campus is like finding a $10 
bill in the laundry machine, and I’m 
forced to park on the other side of the 
freeway. So, it’s the shuttle for me.

The ride begins as the bus roars 
into life and the driver suddenly 
springs into action. I feel like it’s only 
be a matter of time before I see my 
breakfast again. Each time I think that 
I’ve never met anyone who hit the gas 
and pumped the brakes as indiscrimi-
nately as this driver. And with every 
ride, the current driver becomes the 
worst driver I’d ever met.

And as I sit on the shuttle, violent-
ly bouncing up and down at the mer-
est hint of a speed bump, I can’t ignore 
the ‘what if ’ questions sweeping my 
brain. What if she hits that little Smart 
Car? What if the guy next to me eating 
a breakfast sandwich starts blowing 
chunks? 

By the time I reach campus all I 
can usually muster is a meek “thanks” 
to the driver. And I mean “thanks” in 
the way a drafted soldier thanks his 
buddy for shooting him in the foot. 

But despite all that, we’ve all 
depended on the shuttles to get to 
us to and from class. As bumpy and 
stomach churning as they are, shuttles 
are a necessity for those of us without 
$549 to blow on permits or two hours 
to waste in search of parking. No mat-
ter how nausea-inducing that morn-
ing ride is, shuttles are good for us.

Don’t get me wrong, I love my 
car, and there’s nothing like making 
a late-night Rigobertos run after the 
buses have long stopped. But there 
are few things that replace the con-
venience of the shuttles.

 Those friendly blue and whites are 
a gift given to us so that our legs don’t 
fall off as we trek across campus. They 
compensate for overcrowded parking 
lots, distill the fear of death by parking 
tickets and reassure students that they 
won’t be trapped on campus with no 
escape for nine straight months.

Aside from the needs of the 28,000 
people on campus, these metal giants 
are good for the environment too. 
On average, 5,000 UCSD students 
use the shuttles daily, nearly a quarter 
of the undergraduate population. nd 
especially at a school as environmen-
tally conscious as UCSD, it’s worth 
an uncomfortable 10 minutes to do 
our part to stave out global warming.  
Though my stomach might not agree, 
the shuttles make life at UCSD a little 
bit easier.

HIGHER EDUCATION — Community 
college students across the state are jump-
ing for joy. On Sept. 29, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger ratified Senate Bill 1440, 
which guarantees all California community 
college graduates admission into a CSU.
Though ensuring more Californians have 
bachelor’s degrees might be the prescription 
the California economy needs, we have to be 
careful of the hidden side effects the bill may 
present. 

Right now, the state of our economy is on 
everyone’s mind — and rightfully so. With 
the Golden State over $43.5 billion in debt, 
it’s  long been time for a statewide financial 

makeover. 
Before Schwarzenegger signed SB 1440, 

community college students were taking on 
average of 20 credits more than the associate 
degree requirements due to inconsistent and 
constantly changing transfer requirements. 
Cutting the number of units a student needs 
to transfer will save both the student and the 
state money. In fact, merely streamlining the 
arduous transfer process will lead to nearly 
$160 million dollars in savings.

With the new bill, as long as California 
community college students have junior 
standing, they will be awarded with an asso-
ciate degree and guaranteed admission into 

a CSU. According to the Institute for Higher 
Education Leadership and Policy, currently, 
73 percent of California college students go 
to a community college, yet only 22.7 per-
cent who aspire towards transferring to a 
four-year public university actually achieve 
their goal. 

This measure will grant 55,000 more 
community college students a year a shot at 
a bachelor’s degree. And that’s good news, 
because if just 1 percent of Californians 
in community colleges earn a bachelor’s, 
our economy would grow by $20 billion,

Regardless of what you think of Republican Renee Ellmers’ recent “victory mosque” ad, 
it’s difficult not to ask why a congressional can-
didate from the Second House District of North 
Carolina is broadcasting her opinion on a New 
York issue. There’s a simple answer: Ellmers, too, 
wants her 15 minutes of nationwide fame.

Last week, Ellmers launched her “No Mosque 
at Ground Zero” initiative, which features the 
provocative ad. It also encourages her supporters 
to sign a petition against the proposed Islamic 
community center. 

Although it’s tough to think that people of 
North Carolina are truly terri�ed of Muslims 
who seize abandoned coat factories — whether 
in New York or in their own hometowns — it’s 
possible that Ellmers’s outlandish comments are 
garnering the attention her campaign needs. 
Positive or negative, any press is good press. 
However, even if she decided to plant her cam-
paign �ag on moral issues, there are dozens of 
other issues that hit closer to home — abortion, 
gay marriage, gun control –—while the attack 
on the “victory mosque” in New York (some 
500-odd miles away) reads like the public rela-
tions gimmick that it is. For Ellmers, receiving 
the attention of America is apparently worth the 
sacri�ce.

ÔVictoryÊÊMosqueÕÊCommercial

North Carolina’s Republican Congressional candidate Renee Ellmers recently released 
a campaign video denouncing plans for an 
Islamic mosque near Ground Zero. The heavy-
handed criticism over the content in her video 
has resulted in Ellmers being publicly forced to 
swallow her words by a number of major news 
networks. 

Still, you have to give her some credit. Her 
commercial, lacking logic and reason, show-
cases the spirit of a person fighting a fire with a 
flamethrower and a tank of gasoline.

How many politicians would choose to 
tackle a sensitive issue far outside of their legal 
jurisdiction? Renee Ellmers would. Choosing 
the words “the terrorists haven’t won” as her 
first televised sentence takes more brawn than 
brain, but it’s not a career move for the faint of 
heart. In balancing the delicate line between 
attention-grabbing media whore and ignorant 
flagrant racist, Palin-backed Renee Ellmers is 
snatching name recognition through the media 
frenzy surrounding her controversial video.

Perhaps this was her plan all along. “Crazy 
victory mosque lady” may not be the nickname 
that will catapult her to a senator seat, but it 
will — and has — generated enough publicity 
to make her politically relevant. For now. 

—Margaret Yau
Associate Opinion Editor

In an effort to strengthen her platform in the North Carolina election, Renee Ellmers created 
an incendiary ad — using the words “Muslim” 
and “terrorist” interchangeably. So, it’s not surpris-
ing that her intolerance has made headlines.

This blatant ignorance is deeply offensive, and 
is a weak attempt to manipulate people’s prejudic-
es to her own advantage. Ellmers’ ad implies that 
once the mosque is built, Muslim terrorists will 
be loitering on street corners, handing out bombs 
disguised as candy and gleefully brainstorming 
new ways to strike fear into the American people. 

Ellmers openly identifies all Muslims as ter-
rorists — an unfounded correlation. Her platform 
is insulting to not only the Muslim community, 
but also to those who realize that a small group of 
extremists do not — and should not — define an 
entire religion. 

This argument is reinforced by bigotry, ste-
reotyping and a healthy dose of fear to keep her 
audience in rapt attention — unfortunately for 
Ellmers, she appears pro-racial profiling by asso-
ciating terrorism with the entire Muslim com-
munity. The people of North Carolina should see 
Ellmers’ ad not as a heroic stance against terror-
ism, but as the product of a basic misunderstand-
ing of the Muslim community and an example of 
shallow attention-seeking politics.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
       �is coming Wednesday at 
UCSD, two soldiers will recount 
their personal experiences of serv-
ing in the Israel Defense Forces 
(IDF) including checkpoints, its 
2009 attacks against Hamas in Gaza 
and 2006 attacks against Hezbollah 
in Lebanon. �e soldiers, Orit and 
Jonathan, will answer questions and 
discuss their backgrounds and life 
in Israel, sharing experiences rarely 
told by the international media. 
�ey will provide testimony high-
lighting their personal accounts of 
the IDF’s moral code. �eir testimo-
nies contrast sharply with reports of 
alleged IDF misconduct, including 
the Goldstone Report and the recent 
Gaza �otilla incident. Orit and 
Jonathan will speak at Price Center 
West Bear Room in Sungod Lounge 
on Oct. 6, 2010 at 5 p.m. �e event 
is sponsored by StandWithUs, an 
international, non-pro�t Israel

Dear Editor, 
This past Tuesday, my organiza-

tion Young Americans for Freedom 
had the pleasure of hosting con-
servative activist and film maker, 
Christian Hartsock. He spoke about 
activism, gauged club members, and 
talked about his trip to Iraq. His 
speech — entitled “What I Did Find 
in Iraq”— noted the war in Iraq is 
not a lost cause and that Iraqis are 
grateful to the United States for 
continual support and aid. There 
was even a debate sparked during 
the question and answer section — 
signifying the varying opinions held 

among members in regards to the 
Iraq War within the conservative 
movement.

Additionally, Christian Hartsock 
was one of four conservative activ-
ists to appear on CNN this past 
weekend in a segment called, “Right 
on the Edge” alongside Lila Rose, 
Jason Mattera and Ryan Sorba. 
CNN investigative reporter Abbie 
Boudreau covered these young 
activists and their involvement in 
the Conservative Movement in their 
respective spheres. The nature and 
slant of the documentary is debat-
able to most conservatives, though. 
Nevertheless, Christian was featured 
in the documentary in regards to 
his film making. He is best known 
for his involvement as a b-roll 
director for the ACORN investiga-
tion in San Bernadino, California, 
and as the director of a music 
video entitled “Victicrat” featuring 
ACORN investigative journalist, 
James O’Keefe.

Bringing the conservative per-
spective to campus is pivotal when 
trying to engage in campus dialogue. 
Universities tend to lean left, mak-
ing conservative viewpoints heavily 
underrepresented. We host a slew of 
speakers, activities, projects and ini-
tiatives geared towards the notions 
of limited government, defending 
the Constitution, free market prin-
ciples and traditional values. If you 
identify with any of the principles 
mentioned, then I encourage you to 
join Young Americans for Freedom 
this year.

state and local tax revenue would 
increase by $1.2 billion a year and 
174,000 new jobs would be created. 

But despite the 
economic benefits 
of SB 1440, we can’t 
forget that the CSU 
system is bursting at 
the seams with over 
450,000 students 
crowded into the sys-
tem. Last year, for the 
first time in 48 years, 
the CSU system put a 
cap on its enrollment, 
denying 10,000 stu-
dents admission. 

The CSU system 
was forced to cap 
their admissions 
due to a lack of state funding, 
and if we add more students to 
the system without adding more 
funds it’ll only be a recipe for 
disaster. According to California 
Community Colleges Chancellor 
Jack Scott, the bill will directly 

save California $150-$200 million 
a year. However, if the revenue 
from the bill doesn’t go back into 
the CSU system, the CSU system 

be faced with 
an additional 
55,000 students 
they simply can-
not afford to 
educate. 

While SB 
1440 was signed 
with good 
intentions, if 
we can’t follow 
through, both 
the students and 
the CSUs will 
be in a worse 
place than they 
started. 

The CSU system will have to 
cut more classes and students will 
be short-changed with a lower 
quality education. 

Neither the CSU system nor the 
students will benefit from this bill 
if we don’t see the dream all the 

way to the end. 
Currently, UC officials are dis-

cussing creating a similar program 
for the UC system, but they’re 
delaying anything official  and for 
good reason. If the CSU system is 
unable to accommodate the addi-
tional students, it’s reasonable to 
assume that the other state-funded 
higher education system won’t be 
able to accommodate the overflow 
either. 

Who doesn’t want this new bill 
to work? In an ideal world, the 
additional revenue from the bill 
will be put back into the CSU sys-
tem and we’ll see a huge increase in 
state revenue which will allow us to 
slowly pull both individuals and our 
state government out of debt. 

After all, the goal of the bill is 
to create a more educated state that 
benefits everyone.xw

MUIR WOODS

Every morning, Dr. Pascal Gagneux shrugs into his lab coat, heads off to the UCSD School of Medicine and then spends his day dealing with a whole lot of monkey business — figuratively speaking, of course.
Dr. Gagneux, assistant professor of cellular and molecular medicine at the 

UCSD School of Medicine, studies evolutionary biology and primates. Specifically, 
he studies the role that glycans play on the surface of mammalian male reproduc-
tive cells. That’s right. He studies monkey sperm.

 Glycans are a type of sugar molecule that control a huge portion of the repro-
ductive process. For non-biology majors, this means that Gagneux is interested 
in the way mammals’ cells recognize each other, how this has changed through 
evolution and how it can affect reproductive capability. Gagneux is currently 
trying to answer the question: Do the different sugars on chimpanzee and human 
sperm affect reproduction? Can chimpanzee sperm provide the key to problems with 
human fertility?

Gagneux decided to study chimpanzee sperm as a result of the observations 
he made on the  different mating systems of chimpanzees and humans, as well as 
their different sugar molecules. Because chimpanzees practice polygamy, there are 
much higher levels of sperm competition in chimps than in humans. 

It’s a complex concept to grasp. “Given that the glycans on sperm are involved 
in mediating interactions between sperm and the female — her reproductive tract 
cells, immune system and ovum — I decided to focus on sperm glycans,” Gagneux 
said. By studying the differences between human and chimp sperm, especially the 
sugars on the outside of the sperm and how they bind to female reproductive cells, 
scientists can determine what helps sperm bind to eggs — potentially solving the 
problems that plague human fertility.

For Gagneux and his colleagues, the most difficult part of carrying out an 
experiment like this is obtaining live sperm from chimpanzees. It’s messy work.

“It requires training of captive chimpanzees by positive reinforcement,” he said. 
“Luckily the [chimpanzee] keepers consider it a form of enrichment.” Basically, 
keepers have to coax chimps to masturbate into a tube. (And you thought your 
job was tough).

Once the sperm is collected, Gagneux studies it under a microscope. He is 
particularly interested in chimpanzee sperm’s saitic acid and how it might help  
females choose the most compatible mate. Human cells create a similar saitic acid, 
but do not have the correct enzyme to produce the chimp’s version. 

“Understanding how glycosylation affects fertilization is innovative and inter-
esting,” said Jeffrey Esko, co-director of the UCSD Glycobiology Research and 
Training Center and Gagneux’s colleague for the past 10 years. 

Sandra Diaz, senior lab technician in the Varki Lab and a colleague of 
Gagneux’s since 1998 when he joined the lab as a post-doc, said that his research 
is original in field of cellular medicine.

“Pascal is a very creative individual, not only in coming up with experiments to 
test his hypothesis, but also in the ways in which he illustrates them,” she said. “He 
builds models — sometimes huge, sometimes small, always interesting.”

Gagneux earned his masters in population biology and his doctorate on 
population genetics from Basel University in Switzerland. He has been studying 
the population genetics of West African chimpanzees since he came to UCSD as 
a graduate student 17 years ago. He was drawn to the school in part by Professor 
David Woodruff, who pioneered a method of amplifying mitochondrial and 
nuclear DNA from shed hair samples, allowing Gagneux to learn genotyping 
techniques.

He remained at the university for post-doctoral experience and eventually 
earned an assistant professorship.

“I like the open-minded curiosity so commonly encountered among research-
ers here, combined with the relative lack of hierarchical thinking [when] compared 
to European universities,” he said.

In the future, Gagneux wants to explore the parallels between reproduction and 
infection, comparing the “tricks” sperm uses to hide from the female’s immune 
response to the way successful parasites and pathogens conceal their true identity. 

With a lab full of primate sperm, Gagneux clearly has no time to monkey 
around.

 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7MONDAY, OCTOBER 04, 2010

I’m not a very good driver. Sure, I like to hurdle down 
Interstate Highway 5 at 90 mph as much as the next girl, but 
odds are I’m going to make as least one San Diegan scream in 
terror along the way.

So, a scant 15 to 20 minutes from campus, the Miramar 
Speed Circuit offers the opportunity to quench this rabid 
thirst for speed, at almost all hours. The track is seemingly 
always open — I showed up at 9 p.m. on a Friday (it’s open 
until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, 9 p.m. Sundays and 
Mondays and 11 p.m. every other day) with enough time for a 
few sessions before closing. Though the track isn’t very big — 
it takes a minute at most to go around the whole thing — the 
excitement comes from navigating its sharp right-angle turns 
as your tires screech with effort, and dodging (and sometimes 
ramming) other drivers.

Twenty-three dollars earns you 10 minutes on the track 
(they also have lessons and a Grand Prix option, among other 
things), and after forking over the money, you’re directed to a 
set of doors with “drivers only” scrawled along the top. There’s 
a flurry of movement: families sitting on the side of the track 

watching, numerous people careening down the track’s lanes, 
employees warning daredevils to slow down. Glaring fluo-
rescent lights illuminate the indoor track, and kart colors are 
thrown into sharp relief. It’s exhilarating.

After donning a head protector that resembles a black 
polyester condom, it’s time to pick out a helmet from an array 
of color-coded sizes. At the track, an elusive employee (these 
men are neither chatty nor easy to flag down) explains the 
rules: no excessive ramming, slow down when the light is 
yellow or when you’re causing yourself undue pain. No dying. 
Check, check, check — let’s race.

There were four other people entering the track as my 
racing partners: a couple out on a date and a father-and-son 
team. Since the son seemed to be 12 years old (at most) and 
definitely did not have a valid driver’s license, I was totally 
positive I was about to kick some seventh-grade ass. 

I sat down in my kart (ladies: no skirts, trust me on this 
one) and awaited instructions. The kart was designed like 
every standard go-kart (think a poor man’s Ariel Atom minus 
the intense torque, supercharged speeds and overall “holy-

shit” factor) with one pedal for gas, another for the brakes, a 
number stamped on the front, and a wide bumper around the 
edges for safety. Once I settled myself into my seat, a short, 
dour man came to start up my kart. Three false starts later and 
I was off, trailing the father-son team. 

Miramar’s race karts only reach up to 30 mph, but it seems 
a hell of a lot faster. The top of the kart is uncovered, the wind is 
rushing at you, and you’re heading straight at a wall. The effect 
is a lot more overwhelming than going at blistering speeds 
down a freeway. After the first 30 seconds, I began ramming 
the dividing walls at top speed — not by choice, mind you — 
knocking the wind out of me and making my ribs scream with 
pain. An employee hopped over the divides with practiced 
diligence and wagged his finger at me. Slow down.

With my ego badly bruised, I cruised along down the track. 
Soon, I heard the sound of a motor behind me: I was struck 
from behind by the 12-year-old (actually, he looked more like 
a 10-year-old) and unceremoniously shoved to the side of the 
lane. The kid was killing it down the track at an impressive 30 
mph with his father tearing it up beside him. After being tossed 
aside by the obnoxious child four more times, I hit the gas. I’m 
normally not the kind to bully someone who can’t reach the top 
shelf at the library, but no one the size of an Oompa-Loompa 
was going to make a fool out of me. 

I didn’t beat him — he’d lapped me about a thousand times 
at that point — but I did ram him in the rear pretty hard on the 
way back to the starting point, which was enough to make the 
$23 racing charge worth it all on its own. 

Miramar Racetrack brings out the competitive side in its 
patrons, inspiring heated adrenaline rushes as they gun down 
the race lanes. It’s a good option for those looking to get drunk 
on a Friday and put a few people to shame — assuming you 
know how to, you know, drive.

“An apple a day keeps the doctor away,” 
is a familiar saying to mothers everywhere 
attempting to sweet-talk their children out 
of shoving a fourth cookie down their throat. 
These same mothers cram reluctant feet into 
soccer cleats and lug shrieking seven-year-
olds off to AYSO practice, hoping for an 
afternoon of supervised exertion. But what if 
it took more than a healthy diet and regular 
exercise to ward off childhood obesity?

Dr. Jeffrey Schwimmer, associate professor 
of pediatrics at UCSD and director of weight 
and wellness at Rady Children’s Hospital, 

published a paper in the journal Pediatrics 
on Sept. 20 that argued a radical new idea: 
obesity as a virus. 

Schwimmer and his colleagues Charles 
Gabbert, John Arnold and Michael Donohue 
studied 124 children ages 8–10 to assess 
the relationship between a particular virus, 
adenovirus 36 (AD36) and obesity in chil-
dren. The researchers hypothesized that if a 
child was to catch this virus, and subsequently 
develop an immunity to it via antibodies, they 
became more likely to have a higher body 
weight than children who were not exposed 
to the virus at all.

Childhood obesity is a huge public health 
concern in America, and — according to 
Schwimmer’s paper — obesity rates have 
more than tripled in the past three decades. 
It’s become such a widespread concern that 
Michelle Obama has made it a point to com-
bat childhood obesity during her time as First 
Lady. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention estimate that 17 percent of 
children and young adults are obese, which 
will shorten the child’s life expectancy by as 
much as 20 years if he or she should remain 
obese into adulthood. 

Schwimmer was intrigued by this particu-
lar topic after some in the scientific commu-
nity began suggesting a link between microor-
ganisms and body weight regulation. 

“I wanted to know — number one — do 
these results replicate? And — number two — 
are they relevant to children?” he said. 

Schwimmer and his team recruited chil-
dren from the San Diego area specifically 
for the study. The children were classified 
according to their body mass index percen-
tile as either obese or non-obese, and the 
presence of AD36-specific antibodies was 
determined. 

The results of the study revealed that 78 
percent of children found to be AD36-positive 
were obese. In addition, 22 percent of obese 
children had the virus, compared to only 7 
percent of non-obese children — statistics 

that supported an association between obesity 
and the presence of AD36 antibodies. 

Although these results proved the research-
ers’ hypothesis, other possibilities for the link 
include increased susceptibility to infection 
within obese children, as well as an increased 
likelihood of lingering AD36 antibodies.

“There is a lot of research around nutri-
tional and activity factors and sedentary 
factors — sleep, stress, certainly genetics 
— and there are other things that are specu-
lated to play a role,” Schwimmer said. “It’s 
hard to actually prove something in people, 
because the only way to prove it is to do an 
experiment where you actually control the 
parameter.”

The biggest challenge to the researchers 
was securing funding. Many potential inves-
tors were skeptical of a hypothesis that sug-
gested something other than poor diet and a 
sedentary lifestyle could cause obesity. 

“Some people sort of oversold it, as if we 
were suggesting that this is the whole story 
underlying the obesity epidemic,” Schwimmer 
said. “And that’s certainly not at all what we’re 
suggesting. I think that the reality is [that] it 
is not going to turn out that any single factor 
is the whole story.”

Schwimmer hopes to better understand 
how, exactly, the virus affects or leads to 
increased body fat. 

On a grander scale, however, Schwimmer 
wants to continue studying fatty liver disease 
or NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or 
fatty liver disease), which is the most common 
form of liver disease in children. It was for his 
work with this disease that he was awarded 
an American Gastroenterological Association 
Young Investigator Clinical Science Award in 
May 2010, and it’s a condition for which he 
hopes to eventually find a cure. 

“He is one of the leading researchers on 
NASH in children,” Dr. David Brenner, Dean 
of UCSD School of Medicine, said. “His study 
is the first to show a relationship between a 
viral infection and NASH. This will provide 
new insights into the mechanism of the dis-
ease.”

In the interests of both helpless international 
students and ambitious natives, there’s a lan-
guage exchange program at my university in 
Barcelona. The premise is simple: Indicate your 
name, phone number, e-mail address, perceived 
Spanish ability and first language on the sign-up 
form, and wait for the call to meet for coffee. 
Or, you know, talk about Lady Gaga over a beer 
or two — whatever comes naturally. I learned, 
however, that “natural” isn’t easily feigned, and 
the road to fluency is frequently littered with 

uncomfortable encounters with locals.
Fortunately for me, within an hour of sign-

ing my name to the list, I’d gotten the call. 
David pleasantly introduced himself and men-
tioned that he was going to be out of town for a 
couple of weeks, but perhaps after that we could 
meet to talk (half in English, half in Spanish)? 
Sounded good to me. I saved his number in my 
phone as “Davide Lang,” clumsily adding an “e” 
to account for the foreignness of his pronuncia-
tion, and I waited. 

Perhaps it’s worth noting that my Spanish 
ability is not what it once was. Not to sound 
immodest, but in seventh grade with Mrs. Angst 
— yes, the irony was lost on me at the time — I 
was the cream of the crop. I knew miles from 
millones. I conjugated the present tense with the 
best of them. I might even have possessed the 
aptitude to ask for directions to the bathroom.

Yet the rest of my ascent to fluency wasn’t so 
swift. In a moment of middle school embarrass-
ment last winter, it took an inappropriately long 
time for me to realize that my Spanish 2B TA 
really just wanted me to put my cell phone away. 

And while I have indeed been in Barcelona 
for a month taking Spanish-only classes, any 
sense of immersion has been compromised by 
hours of “Desperate Housewives,” and by hav-
ing a roommate who has to practice English for 
her Australian ex-model boyfriend. Plus, when 
I ask for bathroom directions here, the usual 
response is in English. What am I supposed to 
reply, “gracias”?

So when David called me last week to set 
something up, I was ready. The plan was to 
meet for coffee in front of the main entrance 
after I got out of class. Easy enough. I asked two 
friends of mine if they cared to join me (after all, 
I was meeting with a stranger after dark), and 
they happily agreed. 

The three of us waited anxiously for David’s 
arrival. The only working characterization I had 
was of a friendly, sort of feminine-sounding 
guy who had just come back from two weeks of 
vacation. This didn’t narrow the prospects as we 
examined the passing foot traffic. 

When David did arrive, 20 minutes late (but 
only five, really, on Spanish time), we were all 
a bit surprised. Expecting, as I was, a fellow 
university student, David wasn’t exactly the 
man I had pictured. Sure, “friendly and sort of 
feminine-sounding” hadn’t been inaccurate, but 
“white-collar and middle-aged” wouldn’t have 
been off the mark, either. 

We sat down at a cafe across the street from 
campus, where I immediately sought to clear 
the logistics: 15 minutes in Spanish and 15 in 
English? It was utterly un-Spanish in sentiment 
and probably rude, but a graceful, planned exit 
was preferable to faking an emergency to get out 
of a conversation with a man old enough to be 
my father.

David laughed and countered by propos-
ing 30 minutes in each. I couldn’t summon the 
proper vocabulary to argue. Sí.

I had expected, at best, an awkward dinner 
invitation out of our meeting with David, but 
I had to suspend any judgment: More than 
anything, he was interested in talking about 
Chelsea Clinton’s wedding and our university 
homework. He politely corrected grammatical 
slip-ups and, after a beer, even complimented 
my Spanish. 

This, I’ve belatedly realized, is how to learn a 
language: by occasionally making a fool of your-
self in conversation with someone who knows 
better, sure, but mostly by having the courage to 
blather on without hesitation in the first place.

Reese Ehrlich: Conversations with 
Terrorists: Middle East Leaders on 
Politics, Violence, and Empire - 
Peabody Award winning journalist 
Reese Erlich draws on original 
research and firsthand interviews 
in his new book, Conversations 
with Terrorists, wherein Erlich 
offers critical portraits of six Middle 
Eastern leaders sometimes labeled 
as terrorists: Syrian president 
Bashar Al-Assad, Hamas top leader 
Khaled Meshal, Israeli politician 
Geula Cohen, Iranian Revolutionary 
Guard founder Mohsen Sazargara, 
Lebanese leader Ayatollah 
Mohammed Fadlallah, and former 
Afghan Radio ans Television 

Ministry head Malamo Nazamy. 
Veteran journalist Reese Erlich 
offers them a chance to explain 
key issues and to respond to 
charges leveled by the United 
States. Critiquing these responses 
and synthesizing a broad range 
of material, Erlich shows that 
yesterday’s terrorist is today’s 
national leader, and that today’s 
freedom fighter may become 
tomorrow’s terrorist. He concludes 
that the global war on terror has 
diverted public attention from 
the war’s real goal—expanding 
U.S. influence and interests in the 
Middle East—and offers policy 
remedies. 5pm – 7pm / Great Hall

Basia Bulat at the Loft - Since the 
age of three, Basia has been sitting 
on piano stools and trying to hammer 
things out. It started with her mum, 
but along the way Basia picked up 
guitar, autoharp, banjo, ukelele, 
sax and flute. In high school her 
instrument was the upright bass – a 
lone girl among 'eight-foot-tall guys, 
goofing off with the tubas'. There's 
a sense of play that still suffuses her 
music, jostling under the songs of 
regret and love, want and joy. When 
her brother began to play drums with 

punk bands, Basia would be there with 
her demerara voice, joining happily in 
the jam. When she left for university 
in London, Ontario, musicians began 
to drop by her downtown apartment, 
where she honed her craft. 8:30pm /

Men’s Tennis Doubles Team Wins ITA West Regional Title
By Liam Rose
Sports Editor

TENNIS — Both the men’s and wom-
en’s tennis teams saw some success 
in early-season action this weekend, 
with a UCSD doubles team taking 
home a title for the second con-
secutive year at the Intercollegiate 
Tennis Association West Regional 
Championships.

The ITA tournament, held at the 
Billie Jean Tennis Complex on the 
campus of Cal State Los Angeles from 
Sept. 30 to Oct. 2., was the first of the 
season for both teams. The competi-
tion does not affect season standings 
and each took only partial squads.

Senior Erik Elliot and sophomore 
Austin West took home the dou-
bles title this year, beating out the 

team of Rong Ma and Agnel Peter 
from perennial powerhouse Brigham 
Young University–Hawaii. 

The win earns the pairing a chance 
to compete at the ITA Small College 
National Championships, held from 
Oct. 14 to Oct. 17 in Mobile, Ala.

Senior Vincent Nguyen, junior 
Sam Ling and West also competed 
in singles play, but each failed to 
advance in the tournament. 

The women’s doubles squad of 
seniors Taskeen Bains and Natalie 
Varnay also made it to the finals, but 
lost to the top-seeded pairing of Yuan 
Jia and Elwen Li of BYU–Hawaii by 
an 8–3 decision.

“It was great that they got to the 
finals,” head coach Liz LaPlante said. 
“We were very happy to see them get 
all the way there.”

Despite their finals appearance, 
LaPlante said she feels the pairing can 
do better once the season starts.

“They didn’t play as well as they 
could have today,” LaPlante said. 
“BYU–H is a very good team. … 
[Bains and Varnay] definitely can 
beat them, but they’ll have to play 
better.” 

The tournament is held well 
before the start of the regular season, 
so players generally enter with only 
the preparation from summer train-
ing and year-round play.

“We had had three days of prac-
tice,” LaPlante said. “The girls tried 
to play on their own as much as they 
could, but no one was really ready for 
this type of competition. It tells us we 
have a lot of hard work ahead of us, 
and it’s a good way for us to gauge 

where we are.”
UCSD had four players compet-

ing in the singles competition, but 
none was able to advance past the 
first round. 

The pairings of sophomores 
Jacquelyn Davis and Melissa 
Breisacher as well as junior 
Samantha Yeung and sophomore 
Lisa Hardebeck were advanced to the 
second round in the doubles com-
petition.

The Tritons will open their regu-
lar season by hosting Point Loma 
Nazarene on Feb. 8. The men’s team 
will compete in the San Diego State 
Tournament next week, beginning 
Friday, Oct. 8.

This week: women’s volleyball picks up a win and roll Tide.

Tritons Get Back on Track

When a team starts to reach 
record-breaking levels of losing, it’s 
difficult for the players and coaches 
not to think about it. Each loss 
brings more pressure to the next 
game, which rarely helps the cause 
of righting the ship.

UCSD’s women’s volleyball team 
has recently had such difficulties, 
suffering its longest losing streak 
since 1992 and falling out of the 
national rankings for the first time 
since 2001. 

To be fair to the team, how-
ever, the skid was only five games 
long, and the team plays 30 or more 
matches per season. There are many 
programs around the country — 
even some in the Triton’s conference 
— that would consider five straight 
losses simply unfortunate or even 
normal. 

But for the UCSD squad, the 
slide is not taken so lightly. A team 
that has made the NCAA postseason 
every year that it’s been in Division 
II has higher standards for itself. 
The fact that a five-game losing 
streak is noteworthy is a testament 
to the quality of the program.

It should not be forgotten that 
the team lost two All-Americans 
and their head coach in the off-
season. It is normal for turnover of 
important personnel to create some 
growing pains, and this is true of 
any sport at any level. 

With the two wins over the week-
end against Cal State Los Angeles 
and Cal State Dominguez Hills, the 
Tritons appear to be back on track. 
Time will tell if they will stay that 
way, but getting out of the rut they 
had fallen into should certainly ease 
some of the pressure. Head coach 
Riccie Luyties expressed it best after 
snapping the streak: “I am going to 
be able to sleep tonight.”

Who Can Stop the Tide?

In Saturday’s college football 
action, the Crimson Tide jumped 
a major hurdle in their path to a 
second straight national title, steam-
rolling No. 7 Florida, 31–6. 

Alabama looked, if possible, 
even better than last year, while 
Florida appeared a sad shell of its 
former self.

Somehow, this game served to 
grow Tim Tebow’s legacy even more, 
despite the fact that the former 
Gator quarterback has moved on 
to the NFL. Without him, Florida’s 
once-formidable spread offense 
looks inept, even with considerable 
talent at every position. Perhaps 
new quarterback John Brantley 
should not shoulder all the blame, 
but the fans down in the Swamp are 
surely thinking about “the good old 
days” of Tebow’s reign.

The SEC is a tough conference, 
and there’s a lot of football still to be 
played. However, it’s worth noting 
that for three of the last four years, 
the team that emerged victorious 
from the Florida-Alabama game has 
gone on to win the national cham-
pionship. College football is always 
full of surprises, but — after beating 
Arkansas on the road and crushing 
Florida — the Crimson Tide look 
well on their way to once again roll-
ing to the BCS title game.

Condon had 12 kills and 10 digs, Werhane contributed 
a game high of 20 digs and the Tritons got the victory 
despite playing sloppily at times. 

“We’ll take any win we can right now,” Luyties said. 
“Coming off last night’s win, I wanted them to stay away 
from complacency. It was not our best match but I’ll take 
it.”

Setter Thalia McCann added 30 assists and 11 kills for 
the match.

The Tritons trailed by as many as five in the first set, 
but rallied to tie the set at 22 apiece. After hitting errors by 
both teams, Potter hit a straight-down kill to win the first 
set for the Tritons. 

The Tritons gave themselves a comfortable lead in both 
the second and third sets, but each time the Toros cut the 
lead down to two. UCSD managed to get the final points in 
each set to avoid having to move to a fourth frame.

The win moved the Tritons above the .500 mark to 7–6 
overall on the season, including 4–5 in CCAA play. Cal 
State Dominguez Hills dropped to 1–11 overall and 1–6 
in the CCAA. 

While four of the five losses in the streak came on the 
road, Luyties emphasized that travel was no excuse.

“It always helps being at home, and fans can always 
give some kind of lift, but I don’t think it was a home-away 
thing,” Luyties said. “I just think it was not closing out 
games.” 

The Tritons will host Cal State San Bernardino next 
Friday at 7 p.m. The Coyotes currently sit atop the confer-
ence standings with a 12–1 record, including an unblem-
ished 9 –0 mark in the CCAA. UCSD will welcome Cal Poly 
Pomona the following night at the same time.

With a nine-day rest from competition closing, 
the 13th-ranked UCSD men’s water polo team (6–5) 
traveled to Los Angeles to compete in UCLA’s presti-
gious SoCal Tournament on Oct. 1 and 2. 

Coming off a 20–10 victory over Chapman 
University on Sept. 23, the Tritons were one of 16 
teams invited to the tournament. The competition 
hosts some of the country’s best teams, including 
the Triton’s first opponent, Stanford University (4-2). 
Despite the victory over Chapman, the team still had 
many defensive issues to deal with, as shown by their 
game against fourth-ranked Stanford on Saturday 
morning.

UCSD went into the tournament riding a three-
game winning streak, with victories over No. 19 Air 
Force, No. 16 Navy and the crushing victory over 
Chapman University. However, at the first sprint of 
the game it was clear the Tritons — even a new strat-
egy and intense preparation — could not compete 
with the overwhelming strength of the Cardinal. 

Stanford scored the first three goals of the game 
and never looked back. The Cardinal had four play-
ers score three goals to lead the offensive, while the 
Tritons struggled to get going for much of the game.

“We play the rest of the teams in the tournament 
during the regular season, except for Stanford,” head 
coach Denny Harper said. “We could not just seem 
to stop any aspect of their offense, whether it was 
counterattacks or front court offense, and before we 
knew it, it was halftime and we were down.”

Sophomore utility Brian Donohoe and junior 
driver Graham Saber scored two goals apiece on 
power plays after Stanford penalties, but little else 
went the Tritons’ way. Stanford outswam the Tritons 
and consistently scored on fast break opportunities 
through the game. UCSD didn’t manage a significant 
offensive threat until garbage time in the fourth quar-
ter when they were already down 18–7, with both 
teams playing reserve players.

“We played well offensively, but we definitely took 
a few steps backwards,” Harper said.

 “[Stanford] is just better: big, strong, fast, full 
scholarship players. It’s tough for us to compete with 
that, but they just completely outplayed us.”

After their drubbing at the hands of Stanford, 
UCSD was placed into the loser’s bracket and squared 
off against No. 17 Concordia later in the day. With 
only a few hours to rest and strategize between 
games, the Tritons had just enough gas to go head to 
head with the Eagles.

When the game began, it seemed to be deja vu of 
their earlier game for the Tritons, as the Eagles scored 
the first two goals. However, the Tritons buckled 
down and came out strong in the second quarter, 
taking a 7–3 lead into halftime.

Coach Harper attributed the team’s success to 
taking some time off practice before the tournament.

“Resting worked out in our favor because we 
probably played one of our best games of the year 
against Concordia,” Harper said.

Despite exhaustion from having to play only a few 
hours before, the Tritons sped past the Eagles in the 
pool and banged in fast break after fast break shot. 

“[Against Concordia] our game plan worked 
perfectly,” Harper said. “We wanted to outswim this 
team, grind it out, and sure enough, we just started 
wearing them out. They’re not an incredibly disci-
plined group: They’re very emotional, and we just 
had a really good team effort.”

The hero of the game was junior goalkeeper 
David Morton, whose school record of 21 saves 
helped seal the game for the Tritons.

UCSD finished off their round of action in Los 
Angeles on Sunday afternoon, beginning by fac-
ing off against No. 9 Pepperdine at 10:40 a.m. The 
last time the Tritons played the Waves was at the 
Triton Invitational on Sept. 5, where Pepperdine just 
squeaked past UCSD 12–10. The Tritons aim to fin-
ish the tournament with two more strong wins and 
spend the rest of the week resting in preparation for 
their match against No. 8 Cal State Long Beach this 
Friday, Oct. 8, at 6 p.m. at Canyon View Pool.

including a diving header by Coyotes striker 
Albert Cabrera, who hit the crossbar in the 78th 
minute. But neither the Tritons nor the Coyotes 
could pull out another goal, and the game 
moved on to extra time.

San Bernardino earned three corners in the 
first period of extra time, but the UCSD defense 
was able to deal with all of them without inci-
dent. UCSD’s best chance in the extra period 
came from senior forward Kasra Sarabakhsh, 
who sent a shot just wide after a through ball 
from freshman defender Andrew Keimach. 

Even with 44 shots between the two teams, 
each side had to settle for just a point from the 
draw. 

On the Triton’s side, experienced senior play-
ers led the strong defense. 

“Dave Bakal and Jared Kukura put so much 

energy and effort into their game, Pascale said. 
“You’ll get so much out of them. Those two guys 
have really been doing great.”

Kakura — who has earned all-CCAA honors 
in each of the last three seasons — anchored 
the back line that gave up just one goal in 23 
shots. The Tritons were also able to prevent the 
Coyotes from scoring on any of their nine cor-
ners. Brennan provided six saves for the Tritons.

The draw brings the team to 2–3–2 CCAA 
standings. The Tritons are now unbeaten in 
their last three games.

The Tritons will return to action next week-
end by traveling to Cal State Dominguez Hills 
on Oct. 8, followed by a trip to Cal State Los 
Angeles two days later.

MENS SOCCER — The UCSD men’s soccer 
team continued its positive streak in a draw 
with Cal State San Bernardino on Friday, Oct. 
1, playing to a 1–1 tie with the team ranked 
16th in the country.

Playing in front of a home crowd of close 
to 1,000, the Tritons did well to equalize before 
halftime off a goal from sophomore midfielder 
Kian Malek. Both sides put pressure on their 
opposing defenses, but neither could find a 
winner before the end of the second period of 
extra time.

The Tritons got off to a disastrous start after 
the Coyotes made the initial breakthrough in 
only the second minute of the match. Redshirt 
freshman keeper Jesse Brennan rushed off his 
line to gather a loose ball, but Coyote striker 
and CCAA points lead Obi Agwu beat him to 

it, and the striker lifted the ball over the keeper 
for the opening goal. 

The Tritons managed to pull themselves 
together and prevented the Coyotes from run-
ning away with the game. Malek capitalized off 
a beautiful give-and-go with sophomore for-
ward Scott MacBride, scoring in the 35th min-
ute of play. MacBride sent a well-placed flick 
off his heel into the path of Malek, who coolly 
finished past the charging San Bernardino 
keeper. The teams went into the half with the 
score tied at 1.

Coach Jon Pascale emphasized the impor-
tance of finding the equalizer early on in the 
match. 

“Goals help you get some energy and 
momentum,” Pascale said. “It’s certainly easier 
when you’re not chasing a goal.” 

Both sides had chances in the second half, 

After five straight losses, the UCSD
volleyball team sweeps its

weekend games to get back on track.

Stuck in program’s worst losing streak since 1992, the Tritons didn’t just want a win; they needed one. The UCSD women’s volleyball team duly delivered this weekend with wins over Cal State Los Angeles and Cal State Dominguez Hills. The first vic-
tory snapped the Triton’s five-game losing streak, and the pressure lifted almost visibly 
off the squad’s shoulders.

“It feels wonderful,” head coach Ricci Luyties said. “I’m going to be able to sleep 
tonight.”

UCSD defeated No. 23 Cal State Los Angeles on Oct. 1 in a 3–1 decision. 
“It feels great,” junior libero Janessa Werhane said. “It feels like we’re playing as a team 

again. I think the hard work in practice this week paid off tonight.”
Junior outside hitter Katie Condon contributed 12 kills and 19 digs as the Tritons 

defeated the Golden Eagles 22–25, 25–22, 25–16, 25–21 — their first victory in nearly 
three weeks. Senior middle blocker Kaitlin Potter also added 12 kills, and Werhane tallied 
19 digs for UCSD. 

The Tritons were able to remain calm after losing the first set, refusing to yield any of 
the next three sets despite trailing in each one. 

All-American junior outside hitter Roxanne Brunsting returned to the lineup after 
recovering from an ankle injury, and senior outside hitter Hilary Williamson was in her 
second game back after also missing time due to injury.

“We’ve had a few freshmen doing a pretty good job for us back there,” Luyties said. 
“But getting Roxy Brunsting and Hilary Williamson back gives us a little bit more calm. 
It helps us mentally, knowing they are out there.”

Brunsting tallied 12 digs in her return, and Williamson added 10 of her own. 
The Golden Eagles ended the Tritons’ season last year with their 3–0 win in the 

NCAA West Regional Semifinals, but Luyties stressed that Friday’s game was not a 
grudge match.

“We weren’t thinking about Cal State Los Angeles as anyone special, just our next 
opponent,” Luyties said. “We had just one goal: Get off our losing streak and win.”

UCSD out hit the Golden Eagles on the match — .214 to .162 — and totaled eight 
aces. 

The Tritons were able to stay on the winning side with a 26–24, 25–20, 25–20 victory 
over Cal State Dominguez Hills the following night.
