Tuition for

That's what Leg 
Analyst pushes 

BY RICK DOWER 
SKramenlo CorretJpoadeat 

The state's Legislative 
Anafyst recommended 
Wednesday that the Univer· 
sity of California's already 
meager budget for next year 
be pared an additional $29.5 
million, partly by instituting 
tuition for graduate and 
professional students. 

According to the study of 
Gov. Brown's proposed 
budget for UC, prepared by 
the state's chief analyst 
William Hamm, all but $8 
million of the newly 
suggested cuts can be 
achieved without eliminating 
any university programs or 
reducing services from this 
year's level. 

But as one way to make up 
for some of the shortfall, 
Hamm's office is recommend· 
ing that the legislature ask 
the Regents to implement 
tuition for all graduate and 
health science professional

Is the pot calling the kettle black? 
Editor: 

Well excuse me; am I 
mistaken or is the pot calling 
the kettle black? Last 
Monday's political (?) diatribe 
by Mr. Laura consisting of 
regurgitated liberal plati· 
tudes simply cannot be 
ignored. :Sorry, l'etey, but 
unlike constructive criti· 
cism, your "good·humored 
attack' was neither factual 
nor pertinent to issues at 
hand: Ronald Reagan 's 
ability to run the Federal 
Government, and a basic 

understandin~ of United 
States foreign policy 
req uiremen ts. 

What Nancy Reagan has to 
do with the price of a lliyonov 
rifle in EI Salvador is beyond 
me. By your logic, Carter's 
broken collar bone only 
verifies what we already 
knew about him - he is as 
inept on the slopes as he is in 
the Oval office. 

You think General Haig is 
"the most qualified and 
experienced person in the 
obstruction of justice." What 
happened to 'innocent until 
proven guilty'? Since when 
were you named judge, jury 
and executioner? 

So "t hreats and the use of 
force simply will not work in 
the international arena 
anymore," huh! Obviously 
the Soviet bloc countries 
don't subscribe to the same 

newspaper as you do. There 
are about 30 million Poles 
surrounded by 100·plus 
armed divisions just waiting 
for Brezhnev to get a 
translation of your last rose· 
tinted discourse in foreign 
affairs. While you're at it, 
why don't you send copies to 
Ethiopia and Angola - oops 
- too late! 

What's this? The world 
free press doesn't know that 
the Soviets are washing arms 
through Cuba to EI Salvador 
leftists; what newspaper do 
you subscribe to, Action 
Comics? The AP and UPI (no, 
not where you go shopping 
and how you send your 
packages) have been all over 
this story. A government 
report was just released 
confirming what I said in my 
last letter, thank you. 

It is more than just the 
American elites who believe 
that the US is the last 
obstade to the Soviets' goal of 
total world dominance. Sad 
but true, sans American 
arms, the Soviets could roll 
through western Europe 
mighty fast and the Chinese 
are decades away from being 
on a par with the US and 
Soviet military capabilities. 
Unlike France which has 
rolled over twice to foreign 
invasions in the last 70 years, 
if the Soviets ever succeed in 
attaining their goals, who 

Just another statistic 
in LJ's crime wave 
Editor: 

After a hard morning of 
classes, I walked out to my 
car that had been safely 
tucked away in a UCSD 
parking lot to find that my 
new cassette deck had just 
become another statistic on 
the police list of stolen 
stereos. 

Although many other 
students might have been 
outraged at this theft: I was 
overjoyed to learn of it. After 
all, it is just one more way in 
which I can help out the 
destitute people of La lalla. 

Let me point out the truth 
behind this and other similar 
thefts. Some people may 
think that it is just an easy 
way for bored youngsters to 
get extra money, but this is 
not the case. 

Picture the typical poor La 
lalla High student. His 
parents are too poor from 
making payments on their 
condominiums and Mercedes 
to buy him thedrugs he needs 
to survive in his harsh world. 
So he decides to go to work 
and earn some money. ' 

However, he realizes that it 
is not good for the economy to 
spend legally earned money 
on illegal drugs. S6, of course, 
the well meaning student 
turns to theft. This keeps 
illegal money illegal, and 
balances the whole economic 
system. 

What better place to turn 
to than the UCSD parking 
lot? College students are rich 
- they must be if they can 
afford to go to college. For 
some reason many of them 
cannot afford to insure their 
stereos, but this is all the 
better because then the theft 
won't affect the insurance 
premiums of the thief's 
parents. Of course, higher 

premiums would only help 
inflate the economy.' . 

It is not an easy task to 
keep the economy under 
control. Theft is a high risk 
job. Certainly the parking lot 
is heavily patrolled by UCSD 
police. Haven't we all 
received enough tickets to 
evidence this? 

After evading the police, 
the student must go through 
the tricky business of 
removing the stereo. There's 
always th~ clanger of cutting 
his finger on a wire, dropping 
the stereo on his toe, or 
perhaps smashing his finger 
with the crow bar. Once he 
has the stereo, he must again 
sneak through the heavily 
patrolled area. 

Even if he manage to lip 
past the alert police with his 
stolen stereo (and whatever 
else he took, for instance my 
fire extinguisher, a necklace 
and even myoid cassette 
deck) he mu t then deal with 
selling the hot items and 
trying to get his money's 
worth out of them. 

So theft is not actually 
getting something for 
nothing. These students are 
desperate for money and 
work hard for it. Since all of 
us that are college ,students 
always have so much extra 
money anyway, it's only fair 
that we should help out the 
poor high school students 
who are trying to support 
their drug habits on their 
own. Our dutY is clear. As 
soon as I can save enough 
money, I'm going to rush 
right out and have another 
stereo installed in the hope 

, that it will fall into the hands 
of some needy La 101lan. If we 
all do our part, the world will 
be better for it. 

P. Halloran 

will come to our rescue? With 
this in mind, let's now take a 
closer look at the grim picture 
and American defense needs. 

Political scientists have 
predicted another revolution 
or even the total collapse of 
the Soviet Union for 60 years 
now. What you fail to note is 
that Soviet society does not 
enjoy the free flow of 
information that we do (i.e., 
publishing of your letters , 
etc.) that is needed for a 
national revolt (among other 

things). This along with 
government-instilled zeno· 
phobia via propaganda has 
allowed people like Trotsky 
(Lenin's partner and heir 
apparent) to become a non· 
person (his name cannot be 
found in any Russian text) as 
well as allowing Stalin's 
butchering of20 million of his 
own people to go almost 
unnoticed in the USSR. Let's 
not be naive, Petey, the 
Soviets have had shortages 
and alcoholism since its 

inception; we better keep on 
our toe or they may soon 
develop a liking for Kentucky 
bourbon, 

Sure, there are two sides to 
every issue and I'll be the 
first to admit that there are 
aspects about Reagan that I 
don't like; but just as there 
was a need for Carter's 
innocence in the post · 
Watergate election , there is a 
need for Reagan's decisive· 
ness now! 

Harley Bassman 

So what's wrong with being 
comfortable in hot weather? 
Editor: 

Here's to nol looking. at 
you, Daniet Burrier, and 
especially your attitude. 
Attitudes sure do need 
changing, as is evident from 
your hardly liberal, 
typically chauvanistic 
outlook on women and their 
apparent efforts to entice 
the "drooling, starved and 
sexist segment of the male 
population: ' . 

Surprised, are you, that 
women should date to wear 
shorts and cool tops on a hot 
day? Not to shock you or 
anyone, dear, but occasion-
ally women do find it 
slightly more comfortable to 
shed their winter woolens 
when the sun doth shine. 
Naturallv, you neglected to 

Editor: 
After reading Danie] 

Burrier's article "Here's 
looking at you" (Guardian, 
Feb. 23), my immediate 
reactions were anger and 
disbelief. That a self-
professed liberal should 
take it upon himself to tell 
women that their style of 
dress is somehow relevant 
to their status (or lack of) in 
society was infuriating and 
inSUlting. It brought to 
mind cases in which rape 
victims have been blamed 
for their own victimization 
because of their "provoca· 
tive appearance" - this, of 
course, defined by men. 

Editor: 
How dare Daniel Burrier 

make uch generalized, 
perverse, sexist remarks 
about women who attempt 
to keep cool in above-SO 
degree weather by wearing 
shorts! (Guardia", Feb. 23). 

Yes, you do miss the 
. point. Women should be 

able to walk down the street 
or on campus wearing 
anything they damn well 
please, and if the immature 
deviants you associate with 
can't handle it, that is their 
problem. 

But th~ most sick minds 

mention the many bare-
chested men in your attack 
on the "Mademoi~e1le·ites." 
Why should you bother to 
point out their lack of 
clothes? Males are never 
harassed for dressing as 
they please. Only women 
are brazenly told that their 
show of flesh excites 
"drooling," sex-starved 
males. 

Daniel, get a clue to life! 
Why should men or boys 
feel the need to change 
archaic attitudes when 
wonten are "dressed to 
entice," you ponder? 
Because all this sexual 

. enticement garbage is in 
their outrageously horny, 
perverted heads (and I use 
that term loosely). A women 

Mr. Burrier speaks of 
abortion, the ERA and 
equality for women and 
suggests that a different 
style of dress may somehow 
convince men of the 
importance of these issues. I 
don't see a relation . Will 
demure dress change men's 
attitudes toward women? I 
doubt it. Is it possible to 
force men to accept women 
as equal? I also doubt that. 

Legislation can and 
should be passed guarantee-
ing women's equal rights 
and the right tq rcproduc 
tive freedom, but will men 
with attitudes such as Mr. 
Burrier's enforce these 

can rationalize just about 
any injustice they do to 
women by dredging up that 
old familiar p~rase, "She 
asked for it." Everyone, 
male or female, has the 
right to stay cool and 
comfortable when it is 
warm, and we are not about 
to walk around in long 
skirts and pants on a hot 
day just because you and 
your pals can't learn to 
control your libidos. 

Perhans some women 
dress to "entice"lOI1lemen, 
but that is their business. 
So get your facts straight 

doesn't gain her freedom or 
become the new successful 
woman by attempting to 
rationalize with sexist 
attitudes such as yours. If 
you feel the urge to observe 
women and make irrational, 
biased judgments from 
mere appearances, then do 
so in ~rivate. You can get all 
the 'mammae" you desire 
from the numerous porno 
magazines, and if you really 
~t your thrills watching 
'buttock-splitting-short-

clad, tube-topped" women 
bend over, then be sure to 
see "Debbie Does Dallas" 
the next time it shows on 
campus. It might just befit 
your mentality. 

Jane Grafton 

laws? Attitudes cannot be 
legislated. 

Mr. Burrier suggests that 
the burden of change is on 
women alone. I feel very 
strongly that it is necessary 
for all of us - men and 
women - to critically 
examine the roles and ' 
attitudes that we have 
accepted in society and 
make conscious chan~s in 
them. It is only With a 
critical consciousness that 
we can become aware of our 
social and political realities 
and make necessary 
changes in our attitudes 
and in our society. 

Sheryl O'Rourke 

before you go passing 
judgment on everyone and 
perpetuate the myth that all 
women are only out to tease 
men. 

It sure appears to me that 
your "ego' is getting a little 
blown out of shape if you 
actually believe that all 
women who wear shorts on 
·hot days (as do many men) 
are really doing it Just to 
"entice" you - believe it or

things to do than give you a

Why Reagan's economic~ will not work 
WASHINGTON -

When it comes to accuracy in 
forecasting, columnists rank 
with weathermen. Indeed, 
we can't forgert that some of 
our senior colleagues wrote 
confidently about the "New 
Nixon" and predicted the 
shilh of Iran would remain in 
power. 

However, some of the 
worst marksmen can be on 
target. About two years ago, 
we predicted that George 
Bush would be Ronald 
Reagan's running mate. 

As Presi dent Reagan 
unveils his economic 
recovery package this week, 
we'll try our luck at 
forecasti ng again: why it 
won't work. 

Presiden t Reagan 's 
economic package -
basically a reduction in taxes, 
regulations and government 
spending - won't reduce 
inflation or unemployment, 
or build a base for long· term 
economic growth. 

The rhetoric behind the 
Reagan , package is nothinll 

more than the old trickle· 
down theory. The myth is 
that if you provide more 
capital to the folks who 
already have it, they'll 
produce more, create new 
jobs and everyone will 
prosper. Supposedly, a rising 
tide carries all the boats with 
it. 

President Reagan and his 
neo-conservative team point 
to government regulations as 
the cutprit that has 
prevented expansion in the 
private sector. Yet Japanese 
and German corporations, 
which are su bject to toughter 
environmental and safety 
regulations, have expanded 
tremendously in the past 
decade. 

But could it be, as some 
economists suggest, that 
Japan and Germany have 
better corporate managers 
than we do? Are US corporate 
managers just interested in 
short-term profits? Are they 
handicapped bcause they 
come primatily from legal 
and financial backgrounds

Police gave no 
advance notice 
Committee hears testimony 
about November reception 
continued from page 1 
Council, were protesting 
because they felt they had not 
been awarded a substantive 
enough voice in the process 
by which Chancellor 
Atkinson had been selected. 

Entering the Mandeville 
Auditorium lobby, the 
students began marching 
clockwise in a circle (they 
later changed their direction 
to afford a better view of the 
building 's e ntr ance), 
chanting inoffensive slogans 
and carrying signs. 

The protestors were not 
obstructing the path of people 
attending the reception ; 
many who passed the 
picketers smiled and 
murmured about their 
presence, but none seemed 
bothered by them. 

At approximately 4:50 pm, 
after the students .had been 
protesting for 45 minutes, 
campus police officers began 
to herd the demonstrators 
toward the door, failing to 
give any verbal warning or 
explanation for their action. 

One student, AS Student 
Advocate Jon Bekken, sat 
down in the middle of the 
doorway. This move clogged 
the exit, a situation worsened 
by the narrow opening and 
constant police pushing from 
behind. Bekken was quickly 
picked up by police officers 
and thrown out. 

Once outside the building, 
the protestors sought an 
explanation for their forcible 
removal by the police. They 
received none. 

Before long, a handful of 
students pressed themselves 
and their signs against the 
glass doors of the Mandeville 
lobby and beat upon them 
with their fists. The police 
quickly moved toward the 
students and issued an 
unidentified verbal warning 
to cease, which was obeyed. 

There was no further 
protest. 

Questions from committee 
members following the 
students' testimonies 

f~sed on t~e following: 

--intent of the protestors 
in picketing the reception; 

--the students' opinion 
about the level of disturbance 
their presence was causing at 
the demonstration; 

--the students' fee lings 
about the use of police 
photographers at the Oct. 14 
demonstration and ot her 
protests; 

--the possible existence of 
a specific incident or change 
in t he pattern of the picket 
that might have sparked the 
sudden , forcible measures 
taken by the police. 

While all five of the 
students who addressed the 
committee yesterday agreed 
that the campus police acted 
hastily and with unwarran· 
ted force , AS Revelle College 
Representative Martha 
Bauman was particularly 
distressed by their behavior. 

"I got squished as 1 was 
being herded towards the 
door," said Bauman, visibly 
upset . "I couldn't see and 
wasn't given enough time to 
leave, to go through the small 
doorway. 

"When I was first pushed 
towards the door, I asked a 
policeman if 1 could get my 
purse and books before 
leaving. He wouldn't let me. I 
asked him three times and he 
just wouldn't let me," she 
said. 

Bauman then asked a 
police officer with whom she 
was acquainted if he would 
retrieve her belongings. He 
refused, telling her she could 
get them when the reception 
was over, at least an hour 
later. 

It was not until ten 
minutes later, when fellow 
protestors outside the 
building asked dfficers , 
"What harm can it do to ~et 
her purse?" that the pohce 
complied. 

"ram not an activist ," said 
Bauman, "I'm a very 
conservative person. 1 just 
couldn't comprehend that 
people (police officers at the 
picket) could be so mean."

Int'l Center has 
sociable Friday 

Tuition for grads, pros? 
Free food, chance to get 
to know int'l students 

That's what Legal Analyst is proposing 

BY LISA SULLIVAN 
If you seek an escape form the doldrums of cafeteria life, 

but can't hold out until the TGIF's on Friday, you should 
check out "Coffee Hour Fridays" at the International 
Center. 

"Coffee Hour Fridays" are casual get·togethers (with 
plenty of free food) for students from around the world who 
want to meet their American peers at UCSD. 

Sandwiches, fruit, dips , veggies and drinks will be on 
hand for those dropping in the Center's Lounge bet'o.;veen 11 
and 1 pm each Friday. 

It 's purpose is simply to create a community feeling 
between foreign and American tudents in a casual, social 
setting, says Dorothy Edwards of the International Center. 

Edwards says the new "Coffee Hour Fridays" are ba eQ 
on a similar event at t he University of Georgia, but credit 
Phyllis Clark, Dean of International Education , for 
developing the idea at UCSD. 

The Center is just eastof the student center. All student 
are invited to stop by between 11 and 1 pm on Fridays. 

Jerusalem a-v presentatfAyn 
The 1erusalem City Museum will present a multi · 

. screen/audio-visual presentation of Jerusalem at La Jolla

"This is very distressing," 

said UC Student Lobby c0-
director Paul Rogers. "We'll ' 
vigorously oppose any 
attempts to start grapuate

Rogers said the analyst's 
recommendation for tuition 
was "a total surprise" and 
that the pos ibility of tuition 
being considered by the 
legis lature for this year had 
not seemed likely.

Hershman said , "and I can't

The analys t 's detailed , 
non· partisan recommenda· 
tions to the legis lature on the 
state budget are generally 
highly influential in helping 
legis lators make up their 
minds regarding the complex 
appropriations process.

the state's finances in .near-

in windfall profits that its 
five teaching hospitals took 
in last year. The governor 
has al ready proposed the 
univers ity give back $10

The two proposals would 

wipe out that $25 million pot, 
most of which the state 
loaned UC in the first place 
until it could collect its 
outstanding debts from the 
hospital ' patients.

Guitarist DiMeola fast but dull-witted 
Hotel Sple1ldido - AI Di-
Meola (Columbia) 

For those who love guitar 
played faster than data cards 
spat from an over-taxed 
cQmputer, AI DiMeola has 
just the item for you. 
DiMeola, an alumni of Re-
turn to Forever, again speed-
freaks his way through the 
two sides of is recent Hotel 
Splendido with a manner and 
confidence few other fusion 
rock guitarists can manage. 
But while he does impress 

virtuoso who has refined his 
talents to the lowest common 
denominator. At heart, old AI 
is a clever crowd-pleaser 
whose bag of tricks is small 
and near-empty. C minus. 
M'Boom . - (Columbia) 

that ' bind us, hold us far

well but the words don't read 
well. C minus. 
Love to La~ - Sorrows 
(pavill ion) 

one ,)0 the level of pure 
technique - I tend to think of 
DiMeola as something of a 
musical . . logical positivist 
whose confidence in 
technique seems to usurp the 
province of intuition and 
imagination - the music. 
oddly enough, is not rousing 
or exciting. It comes down to 
something no more profound 
than that. DiMeola's records 
are suffering from sameness: 
the compositions are again 
souped-up latin-rock jams, 
ala Santana (sans the 
moments of spontaneity) and 
DiMeola's guitar work hasnJt 
changed an iota, oonsisting, 
typically, of lethargic slow 
starts, muted phrasing and 
sudden, pseudo-climatic 
bursts of speed culminating 
in a monotonous. hysterical 
frenzy. It's obvious by now 
that DiMeola is not an 
improvisor of any calibre, 
being rather a calculating 

Drummer Maz Roach, a 
premier percussionist whose 
skills have lent themselves to 
a number of the great jazz 
artists, has on M'Boom 
gathered some of the best 
percussionists available for a 
jazz record that pushes the 
concept of percussion beyond 
what we would expect. 
Employing inst ruments such 
as vi braphone. marimba , 
orches tra bells and timbales . 
among the over 100 
instruments that the 
ensemble utilizes. M'Boom-
members including Roach, 
Roy Brooks. Ray Mantilla, 
Warren Smith. Freddie 
Waits , Omar Clay and Fred 
King - works in near-perfect 
consort. synchronizing the 
indigenous tones and pitches 
of their instruments for a 
music that swings from the 
abstract colorations of 
Monk's "Epistrophy," the 
lilting melodicism of 
"Twinkle Toes," to the hard-
bop contours of a couple of 
other tunes. Rather than 
being a random bongo-jam, 
M'Boom has the gift of 
orchestration. producing a 
jazz that. while lacking 
conventional rhythym 
section or reed instruments, 
is nonetheless compelling. A. 

AI DiMeola 

Yet another entry into t,he 
already over· saturated power 
pop area, Sorrows is of 
interest because Shel Talmy, 
the Who's original producer 
is the one taking production 
credits for this record. (peter 
Townsend, remember, was 
the first to coin the phrase 
"power pop"). As is, Sorrows' 
sound is, like the hordes of 
other power-pop units, a 
competent though faceless 
gathering of influences by the 
Beatles, the Hollies, 
Raspberries and others. In 
two cases, though, they may 
have radio hits on their 
hands: "Rita," a crunchy 
rocker with a guitar riff lifted 
straight from the Animals old 
hit ~'It's My Life," and 
"Cryin' Time," a semi-
reggae performance that's 
sufficiently de-ethnicized to 
appeal to a mass audience 
that doesn't want to stray too 
far 'from what it's accus-
tomed to_ And that's the 
problem with Sorrows: 
though they sound as though 
they might be able to come up 
with some attention-
grabbing material in the 
future - there are nice 
flourishes here and there -
they've chosen to play it safe 
this time out, a choice that's 
made them utterly without 
character. Remember what 
someone said about first 
impressions being the most 
important? C minus_

Standing On Rock is Winter's

BY KATHY FINE 

The UCSD gym's north 
balcony fills with the sounds 
of jazz. Soft wh~s~ of "five, 
"ix, seven, eight" spread 
across the room. Four at a 
time, 4ancers chausse' and 
pas de bourre' toward the 
center of the floor. Pat 
Rincon, current director of 
the UCSQ dance dept ., sits by 
the record player, pen and 
clipboard in hand, and looks 
from dancer to clipboard to 
dancer. One dancer has her 
hand out of line with the 
others. . 

"Stop'" The dancers are 
sweating. It is the fifth time 
they've rehearsed the ·piece 
this afternoon. 

"This isn't create-your·

Rincon. "Let me see that 
position again. Hands flat to 
the front , head back but not 
crun ched, energy in the 
arms. OK. let's try it again .

energy and enthusiasm in 
creating the Winter Dance 
. Concert. 

Five years ago this same 
. gym was the stage for the 

first dance concert. At that 
time Margaret Marshall, 
UCSO's only full time dance 
instructor, started the 
department from scratch. 
She took the 20 dance 
students brave enough to 
appear in public in leotards 
and tights, and despite the 
lack 01 funds and support 
from other departments , 
despite constant reminders 
from the PE' office that she 
was in a physical 'education 
department and not a ballet 
school, she organized the 
dances, mus ic , light s, 
costumes and publicity for 
the performance. The concert 
was such a success that it has 
become an annual event with 
close to 140 students and 
faculty part icipating. T o this 
day there is a lack of funds for 
t he department, bu t t he 
perform ances have, never-
t heless, moved from the gym 
to Mandeville Auditorium. 

Dance at UCSD, as Pat 
Rincon puts it , "is bursting at 
t he seams." Attendance has 
quadrupled in the past six 
year s. The 22 classes are 
fi lled to capacity and each 
quarter t here is a long 
waiting list. It has become 
one of t he biggest depart· 
ments in physical education.

interest in dance? 
One senior chemistry 

student, who has been 
dancing at UCSO for two and 
a half years, claims dancing 
helps her keep her sanity. 

"It is something I can 
invest myself in," she says, 
"a source of total concentra· 

tion outside of science." 
A female medical student 

and ballet dancer had a 
similar response. 

" It is the only thing that 
gets me away oompletely 
from the medical school. You

DO YOU KNOW THIS PIAN?

If not, maybe you shouldl 

To Pat Rincon, dance is like 
a religion. It encompasses 
everything, the body, the 
mind and the spirit. 

"You walk into the studio 
with your leotards and 
tights, put the rest of your 
things on the side of the 
room, and from there on out 
you think of nothil,ll{ but 
where your feet are going and 
the rhythm of the music. It's 
not until the dancing stops 
that you beg;in thinking 
about what you re going to do 
with the rest of the day and 
how you plan on facing the 
real world." 

To her there is something 
more su btle and more 
appealing about dance than 
the feeling of well·being one 
obtains from t he exercise. 
T here is a special relation· 
ship that forms between 
dancers, a physical relation· 
ship, one t hat come from the 
interaction of bodies and the 
exchange of movement. 

The annual dance concert 
provides the students with 
the opportunity to bring 
toget her all they have learned 
in cla ses. . 

" You tell a student that he 
puts his arm in the wrong 
place and he wants to know 
why it matters," says Pat 
Rincon. "Performance shows 
him why ." 

The students ·learn how to 
dance with each ot her; they 
learn rhythm, timing and 
cost ume oes igning. The 
teachers, a lso, are able to put 

them elve in the lime light 
as professional choreogra-
pher and dancers.

Cheap horror film digs O\vD grave 
BY RJCK GREENE 

In a 1931 horror film, a 
man named Renfield meets 
Count Dracula for the first 
time as he hears the repeated 
baying of Transylvanian 
wolves. "Listen to them," 
says Dracula (Bela Lugosi), 
"the children of the 
night ... what music they 

Film drips bloodlust, gore and carnage' the early and mid '60s (Taste The Blood of Dracula, Torture 
Garden, etc.) lmd in The 
Tu4' Chainsaw Massacre, 
probably the first thing of its 
ilk. The recent wave of 
dismem berment and lacera-
tion was kicked off in 1978 by 
director John Carpenter's 
Halloween, an authentic 
cinematic experience. After 
Halloween's great financial 
return, the Exploitationists

cashing in on cashing out 
ever since.

The same year a quite mad 
H~ Frankenstein (Colin 
Clive) discusses a str~e, 
lifeless form under a white 
sheet. "That body is not dead. 
It has never Jived. I created it. 
I made it with my own hands 
from the bodies I took from 
graves, from the gallows, 
anywhere!" 

"There are some things 
that man must leave alone," 
said one scientist of The 

Invisible Man in 1933. while 
after the climax King Kong a 
saddened Carl Denham 
(Robert Armstrong) says "It 
wasn't the airplanes that got 
him, it was beauty killed the 
beast!" 

That's all great stuff, 
classic examples of clever 
dialogue from some of the 
best motion pictures in the 
most popular of American 
film fenres - the horror 
film. t's easier to make a 
person (or an audience) 
scream than to laugh, cry or 
get involved in character 
development. Terror is the 
most readily evoked 
cinematic. emotion. 

Some of the dialogue in the 

recent release My Bloody 
Valentine, the latest in a 
string of cheaply made gory-
death films, is as follows: 
"Hey you clowns," "Let's go 
guys,' "It's no skin off my 
nose" and a memorable 
female rebuff to a male's 
advances, "Suck it in and zip 
it up, will ra!" Then, of 
course, there s the old man 
warning the young funloving 
teens, "Laugh now, but you'll 
be sorry you didn 't listen to 
me!" and "Don't say I didn 't 
warn you!" 

This is not so much a 
review of My Bloody 
Valentine as it is a comment 
on the death of the horror 
film and the horror of the

'·Thi. means that we. must 
fight just to receive the funds 
we got last year. It doesn't 
even take into account the 
rising expenses." 

One thing that bothers 
Harper is that the coaches 
were given only two weeks 
prior notice about the 

meeting. "I don't under tand 
why Sweet would wait to the 
la t minute to inform the 
coaches. I'd hate to see our 
request turned down becau e 
we weren't prepared . I don 't

The women's basketball team is on a streak of sorts-
two games to be exact - after winning their last two 
matches against league opponents. The Tritons edged Cal 
Lutheran 68-64-last week and handily defeated Cal Baptist, 
60-50. 

Mary Egan led UCSD with two big perfo~ances , 
scoring 26 points against Cal Lutheran while pullIng down 
18 rebound .. and 37 points against Cal Baptist with 25 
rebound. Egan was 16 for 26 in the Monday night game, 
and was, "pretty much the whole game," according to her 
coach Judy Malone. 

The team closed out their season with two home games. 
The first is against LA Baptist Friday at 5 pm. Saturday 
they playa rematch with Cal Lutheran at 4 pm. Both games 
are in the Main Gym.

A quick look at orne team 
statistic will show that the 
Triton waterpolo program 
ha improved dramatically 
over the past four years. 

Four years ago, Ru s 
Hafferkamp wa coaching 
the Triton team. Hafferkamp 
has been credited with laying 
the foundation for the 
program. According to . nior

Under the direction of 

Harper, the Tritons ended 
their season with a record of 
19 wins and 10 losses and a

As Profumo notes, most of 
these losses were to NCAA 
Divis ion 1 schools. 

With a strong group of 
recruits ent ering next year , 

Harper hopes that UCSD 
may gain a playoff berth in 
the NCAA tournament. "I

Sham won't use police anymore 
continued from page 1 

Sham defended the closed 
meetings yesterday on behalf 
of professors as well as those 
with cases before the CEP, 

"In my opinion, having 
reporters at the meeting is 
very inhibiting ... Idon't think 
untenured, young prQfessors 
would serve on the commit-
tee in those circumstances, or 
they would at least be placed 
in awkward positions ," he 
said. 

Sham has argued in the 
past three weeks that the 
committee also had to meet in 
secret because they were 
considering the case of a 
student he refused to name, 
Montgomery Reed. 

CEP member Ronald 

Langacker Monday submit-
ted to the committee a two-
page report on Reed's case. 
Reed successfully petitioned 
to shift six incomplete and 
two "no records" to letter 
grades so that he could 
graduate and apply to 
graduate school. They were 
rolled back to "F's" at the 
request of Third College 
Provost Joseph Watson, who 
argued that the grades had 
passed the one-quarter 
deadline allowed for the 
make-up of Incompletes. 

Langacker found that "Mr. 
Reed' case differs not in kjnd 
from that of many students, 
but only in degree, specifi-
cally to the su bstantial 
number of (Incompletes) 

involved, .. 
"Both in tructor and the 

Registrar accepted the 
request-for-incomplete forms 
despite the lack of a stated 
reason for the request. We 
have no reason to doubt that 
t he tolerance of this and 
similar omissions in filling 
out such forms has been 
common, or at least not 
unheard of... 

"There has been confusion 
and inconsistency by 
everyone involved," Lang-
acker wrote. 

CEP Graduate student 
representative Wayne Dick 
said yesterday that the CEP 
debated the report for over 
two hours during the 
"intense" meeting. 

Dick also said there was a 
feeling on the committee that 
"Level 2" of the report, 
dealing with the Incomplete 
policy at UCSD, should be 
"watered down." 

Lankgacker's report will 
not go before the Academic 
Senate, which has been asked 
by CEP to review the case. 

Senate Chairman J . 
Freeman Gilbert said 
Tuesday that the Senate will 
appoint a faculty judicial 
comittee to review Reed's 
case and act on the CEP 
report . 

The Senate was to have 
considered the problem 
Tuesday, but neither the 
Senate nor the Senate's EPC, 
which is empowered to act in

the Senate's place, could 
reach a quorum. The 
Sena~e's next meeting is the 
end of March, but the EPC 
will meet Tuesday (the same 
meeting the Guardian will 
petition) to appoint the 
judicial committee. 

Several students and press 
representafives present at 
Monday's CEP meeting plan 
to attend the EPC meetil!fl. 

Four students - including 
a reporter from the GlUlrdul1' 
and the new indicator - were 
barred from Monday's 
meeting by campus llOlice for 
the second meeting In a row. 

Originally scheduled to 
convene in the Academic 
Senate conference room, the 
committee reconvened next 
to the police station after the 
reporters and students 
entered the building early. 

About 45 minutes prior to 
the meeting, the front door of 
the Academic Senate room 
was locked and the shades 
pulled down, to bar the 
students froAl entering. 

However, the students 
entered an unlocked rear door 
despite the protests of two 
secretaries in the building. 
They·waited for a half hour 
before the location of the 
meeting was changed. 

The meeti~ was barred to 
all but commIttee members 
and one campus police officer 
by Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage, who had earlier 
refused a request by Sham to 
take disciplinary action 
against students who had 
refused to leave last week's 
CEP meeting. 

Backed by several campus 
police officers and detectives, 
and several administrators 
who had been asked to urge 
students to avoid a 
"confrontation," Armitare 
said he was ' "mere y 
following Dr. Sham's orders 
to keep the meeting closed." 

Armi tage supported 
Sham's request to close the 
building and the meeting, "on 
the basis of all legal opinion," 

According to university 
officials, including the UC 
General Counsel, the 
University of California is 
not a state agency and is not 
bound by laws that require 
state agencies to hold open 
meetings, 

Students who tried to 
attend Monday's meeting, 
however, claim that UC is a 
state agency and is bound by 
all applicable laws that 
mandate open meetings.

Meantime, how can there

PresIdent Reagan slashes the

who need the skills to do

those skills if the education

18 The Guardian - Thursday, February 26, 1981 
, 

'Paranoias' prevent test ban treaty - York 
ContiDUed from' PIlle 7 
Disarmament agency and the 
Department of Energy meet 
to formulate a basic plan. 

"There is fundamental 
disagreement within the 
government and debate is 
more heated with them than 
with the Russians," said 
York. 

There is flexibility, and 
options are discussed frankly 
in the Washington planning 
process. However, the 
President has the final say. 
"Up until Senate approval 
the President has absolute 
authority with respect to 
establishing the American 
position," added York. 

Once the policy was 
formulated the negotiating 
team flew to England to 
"make sure that Great 
Britain and the United States 
were on the same wave-
length, and to make sure each 
understood the other's 
position." Then on to Geneva 
to negotiate with the Soviets. 

York, who represented the 
President, traveled with a 
team that varied from 15 to 
20 fellow negotiators. These 
people were representatives 
of the same agencies tht had 
advised the President in 
Washington. 

One of the functions of 
these peOple. which included 
lawyers and seismologists 
(for verification purposes), 
was to monitor the proceed·' 
ings and provide technical 
expertise. 

The other reason being to 
monitor York, "to make sure 
I obeyed instructions and did 
not step outside my 
instructions. Once overseas, 

ambassadors have no 
authority over substance. 
Flexibility and options are 
spelled out by the govern-
ment," he said. 

"Generally our relations 
with the Russians were 
cordial, but not friendly, The 
political gap is simply too 
great to bridge," commen· 

DOO.a.UIY 

ted York. 
The fate of the negot iations 

are ,uncertain. "Whether the 
negotiations will resume is a 
question that I can't answer.

amount to, if agreed to by the 
legislature, but the analysis 
notes that UC currently 
charges about 30 percent less 
than other comparable public 
insti tutions for health 
science and graduate study. 

This is the third year in a 
row the Legislative Analyst 
has recommended health 
science tuition, but it was 
rejected both previous times 
by lawmakers. An across-the-
board increase in fees for 
graduate students has not 
been suggested before. 

An ot her s ignifi ca n t 
casualty of the analyst's blue 
pencil was a proposed 
allocation of. $5 million for a 
microelectronics research 
center at UC Berkeley, one of 
Gov. Brown's pet projects, 

The budget analysts say 
the ambitious project should 
be denied until the university 
can better justify why it 
needs the new research 
center when other centers at 
Stanford and Cal Tech may 
a lready otter the same 
service. The UC lab would 
have primaril~ benefitted the 
state s growing computer 
industry, which was 
expected to provide matching 
funds. 

The analyst is al so 
suggesting that UC give up a 
$2.3 million loan to help 
finance Medicare and 
MediCal patient reimburse-
ment at its hospitals and $1 
million in individual faculty

Valentine 
continued from page 14 
tHe air hose of a fully 
outfitted and masked mine 
worker just before he impales 
her. Later , her bloody, 
gouged-out heart is delivered 
to the mayor in a candy box 
as a warning - don't hold the 
Valentine's Day dance or 
else, The bodies begin piling 
up. One women is incinerated 
in a clothes dryer, several are 
pick-axed through the chest 
and one kid is even drowned 
in a pot of boiling hot dogs! 
And all the while the killer, 
breathing through his air 
mask like an asthmatic 
Darth Vader, keeps deliver· 
ing severed hearts in candy 
boxes. 

it 'S' sickening just to read 
about it, much less see it. 
There's no tension or 
susoense here. It doesn't 
matter who lives or dies in 
this drek as long as the screen 
drips , with bloodlust, gore 
and carnage every 12 
minutes. Yeeeccchhh! 

Although most of t<xlay's 
horror films are of this slash-
and-cash type, there have 
been a couple of recent non· 
cheapo ventures. Th e 
Awakening was a sorry 
attempt to bring back the 
Mummy movie without a 
mummy in it. Perhaps the 
biggest di appointment of all 
wa last summer's The 
Shining, which suffered from 
too much misplaced comedy, 
too much obscure Kubrick 
and not enough horror. 

So it seems that , for now, 
the horror film is temporarily 
dead , But the Wolfman is due 
for a comeback and you can 
be sure that, once all that 
squirting blood clear from 
filmgoers' eyes, the horror 
film will again ri e from the 
grave.
