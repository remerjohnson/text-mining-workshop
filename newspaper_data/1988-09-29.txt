Gang Slaying Hits Home at UCSD 
By DENISE DADOR 
Staff Writer 

The tragic slaying of a 19-year-old Filipino man in 
Southeast San Diego has hurled gang-related violence 
into the media spotlight and has prompted UCSD 
police to be on the lookout. 

"Gangs do come up here," campus police officer 
Randy Fedak said. For the most part they're here to 
visit friends or to make a buck." 

• 

Fedak also said that officers have recently undergone 
training sessions with San Diego gang unit specialists to 
be prepared in the event of gang disturbances. He aid 
he has sighted gang members attending school functions 
on several occasions. 

He said that most gangs deal with drug-related activi 
ties, whereas some gangs are primarily concerned with 
territory. Fed~k explained that Blad: gangs, called 
"Crips" and "Anti-Crips," deal in rock cocaine while 
Latino gangs will engage in criminal activities within 
their "turf. " 

The ullexpected death of Weber L. Gabriel of Para-
dise Hills hits even closer to home for UCSD student ' 
Jennifer Gabriel, the victim's sister. 

"Gabriel said that her brother was arguing with the 
assailants, who were members of the Hispanic gang 
"Pl\radise Hills Locos" on September 19, when he 
noticed they had a gun. "He started running, but he 
could not escape," she said. 

to see him have something in life," she said. "He was -
taken away from us so early." 

According to Fedak, Crips usually wear blue and 
white clothmg and scarves. To identify themselves, this 
gang will greet each other by saying "What it 'C'like". 

Anti-Crip gangs, called "Pirus," a name which orig-
inated from a street in Los Angeles, are into the color 
red and refer to themselves as "bloods." Fedak says 
these gang members will greet each other with "What it 
'B'like. " 

Detective Felix Guirre of the San Diego police gang 
unit said 2,000 "gangsters" have been documented in the 
city, and that some gangs "have no borders." 

San Diego Police report a juvenile and an adult man 
have been arrested in connection with the killing. The 
fatal shooting marked the 23rd gang-related death in the 
city this year. 

Gabriel, 21, referred to her brother as the silent type 
who valued his friends most of aU. "My family wanted 

UCSD police officer Fedak explained that although 
gangs and gang-related activities are on the rise, campus 
police have been able to keep a tight rein on the 
situation. 

"We have a very safe campus. Gang member types 
wouldn't fit in. They don't carry back packs or ride 
likateboards. They would stick out like a sore thumb." 

Fedak classified gang participants into three types: 
hardcore members, associates and affiliates. Fedak said 
that a lot of people grow up in gang areas and have no 
choice but to know the members.

Penn's goals for student affir-
mative action at UCSD begin 
with increasing the number of 
underrepresented minority stu-
dents. 

In addition, Penn would like to 
see increased support both finan-
cially and academically for mi-
nority students. Penn stressed that 
to help students academically the 
minority students would not be 
put in remedial courses, but rather 
they would obtain academic sup-
port from programs such as 
OASIS and EOP. 

Another of Penn's goals for 
affirmative action programs is to 
follow students all the way from 
recruitment to after graduation, 
when they enter the work force or 
continue their studies. 

The affirmative action commit-
tees strive to make sure that the 
students they have selected are 
developing well intellectually and 
that their activities are flowing 
smoothly. 

If student affirmative action is 
going to work, then staff and 
faculty affirmative action must 
work." Penn said. "In a nutshell, 
we need to hire minority faculty, 
and that include Blacks, Chica-
nos, American Indians, Hispan-
iC:i, and women." 

As for staff, Penn believes that 
UCSD needs better representa-
tion of minorities and women in 
upper managerial positions. He 
added that models need to be 
created, so that lower-level staff 
members have a sense of some-
thing to achieve. Penn suuested

Lecture Notes in the Red. 
By DAVID BROOK.S 
Staff Writer 

. 

A.S. Commissioner Luis Ramirez announced 
last night that two A.S. enterprises lost a total of 
S19,000 during the 1987-88 academic year. 
Assorted Vinyl, the campus record store, re-
ported a 54,000 loss while the A.S. Lecture Note 
Services posted a S15,000 loss. 

However, two other A.S.-run enterprises 
reported profits totalling over 554,000. A.S. Soft 
Reserves, responsible for distributing tests from 
previous quarters and course readers, made a 
S16,000 profit. The Grove Caffe, an outdoor 
coffee and pastry eatery, brought in over S38,000 
in profit. 

Ramirez was quick to point out that despite 
the losses, students should look at the A.S. 
enterprises "as a whole." 

In related matters, Vice President of Finance 
Eduardo Rallo-Verdugo submitted a proposal 
for expansion of the Grove Caffe. The $22,000 in 
the proposal will reportedly come from the 

Grove Caffe's account. 
In other financial matters, Programming 

Commissioner Jonathan Judaken submitted a 
528,000 allocation for programming expenses 
Of these funds, over S 14,000 has been allocate 
exclusively for beer for the 14 planned TGs this 
year. 

The allocation will be voted on during next 
week's meeting, after the Finance CommJttee 
has made its recommendations. 

In other news, Parliamentarian Eric Chazan-
kin resigned after serving for two years. Chazan-
kin told the Guardian that "It wasn't anything 
against the A.S. It was time to give someone else 
a chance." Sophomore Evette Lee Gee was 
unanimously voted in as the new parliamen-
tarian. 

In other matters, Student Advocate Bard-
Alan Finlan reported that UC President David 
Gardner signed legislation severely limiting stu-
dents' rights during grievance hearings. 

Finlan told the A.S. that his protests to the 
University of California have resulted in "no 
response."

UC Berkeley Athletes to 
Compete in Summer Olympics 

For 10 Olympic athletes and three coaches, the 
road to Seoul passed through Berkeley. 

Former UC swimmers Matt Biondi and Mary T. 
Meagher head the list of a Berkeley group that com-
peted in Seoul, South Korea, at the 1988 Summer 
Olympics, which began September 17. 

Biondi, a spring 1988 graduate, qualified for seven 
ev nts at the U.S. swimming trials in Indianapolis. 

Meagher, who graduated last December, made her 
third Olympic team by qualifying for the 100- and 
200-meter butterfly. 

Other former Bears representing the United States 
will be four-time water polo All-American Kevin 
Robertson, women's field hockey standouts Sheryl 
Johnson and Marcy Place and rowers Chris Hunting-
ton and Mark Zembsch on the men's crew team. 

Three current UC Berkeley athletes performed for 
different homelands. Hiroko Nagasaki of Japan and 
Kim Chen of Taiwan both swam the women's 100-
and 200-meter breaststroke, while sprinter Atlee 
Mahorn ran for Canada's men 's track team. 

As for the coaching ranks, baseball skipper Bob 
Milano is an assistant to Stanford's Mark Marquess. 
Men's swimming head coach Nort Thorton is an 
assistant for Richard Quick, and Steve Heaston, an 
assistant under Berkeley's Pete Cutino since 1982, will 
have an identical role with the U.S. water polo squad . 

SPOTLIGHT 
Wassermen Named Chairman of 
U CSD Medical School 

Stephen 1. Wasserman, M.D., a noted immunolo-
gist and allergy specialist, has been named chairman 
of the department of medicine at the University of 
California, San Diego School of Medicine. 

Wasserman, 45, joined the UCSD faculty in 1979 
and has served as acting chair of the department of 
medicine since 1986. His appointment as chair is 
effective October I, 1988. 

"After a national search involving outstanding can-

BLOOM COUNTY 
,......------., 

didates from across the country, the individual who 
emerged as the leader was Dr. Wasserman," said 
Gerard N. Burrow, M.D., UCSD vice chancellor for 
health sciences and dean of the School of Medicine. 
"He is a respected scientist and brilliant clinician, and 
he proved his administrative mettle during his tenure 
as acting chairman." 

The chairmanship of the department of medicine is 
considered one ot' the pivotal positions at any medical 
school, because of the size and scope of the depart-
ment. UCSD's department of medicine has 170 scient-
ists and physicians on the faculty and 15 divisions, 
with a departmental budget of $30 million. Besides its 
extensive patient care and research activities, the 
department plays a leading role in the education of 
medical students, and has 76 interns and residents and 
100 postdoctoral fellows in its postgraduate programs. 

Wasserman is considered to be a consummate 
physician-scientist, directing basic research to solve 
medical problems. He has made significant contribu-
tions to the current understanding of mast cells, 
important mediators of allergic and immunological 
response. 

Wasserman is professor of medicine and chief of 
the division of allergy at UCSD. He was appointed 
acting chair in 1986 when Helen Ranney resigned to 
become a Distinguished Physician at the Veterans 
Administration Medical Center.

Dependency Recovery Programs, will present, "Why 
Can't You Hear My Cry For Help?" at noon, Friday, 
October 7, at the S_an Diego Gas and Electric build-
ing, 101 Ash Street. The event is free and open to the 
public. 

Chappell's lecture continues the "Blueprints for Bet-
ter Living" series sponsored by the Vista Hill 
Foundation. 

Chappell examines how the alcoholic/ addict, his 
family, peers and employers deny his addiction. 
Chappell, from an alcoholic family himself, says 
denial is pervasive; people don't want to see or recog-
nize the problem. 

"Alcoholics have learned 'survival manipulation' to 
get through the system day to day. They know how to 
make an employer feel sufficiently gUilty about ques-
tioning their problem so they will hesitate to ask 
again!" 

Chappell will graphically illustrate one's progres-
sion from social drinking to fully developed chemical 
dependency, including the warning signs that occur 
before medical symtoms are visible. Chappell, for-
merly the Commanding Officer of the Naval Alcohol 
Rehabilitation Training Center, will also demonstrate 
how the liquor industry uses subliminal advertising to 
influence drinking behavior.

Volunteer Connection Needs Help 
Are you getting depressed hearing about the 

homeless problem? Have you seen the ads by 
PLUS (Project Literacy U.S.) about the fright-
ening realities of illiteracy in our country? Do 
you wish you could do something about all the 
kids dropping out of school or getting hooked 
on drugs? 

Many of San Diego County's non-profit 
agencies are doing their best to address some of 
these issues. They can't .do it alone. The Volun-
teer Connection and the UCSD Guardian want 
to help you get involved. Each week we will 
highlight various volunteer opportunities in San 
Diego. The amount of commitment is up to 
you. Every little bit helps. For more informa-
tion, call the VC at 534-1414 or stop by our

As many as 23 million adult Americans are 
functionally illiterate, lacking basic skills beyond 
a fourth-grade level. Another 35 million are 
semi-literate, lacking skills beyond an eighth-
grade level. The San Diego Public Library is 
offering literacy instruction to adults 16 years or 
older who ordinarily speak English in daily life 
and are not being served by other educational 
programs. They are looking for tutors to work 
three hours a week to assist them.

UC Berkeley AIDS Class 
Taught by Undergraduates 
By IRENE CHANG 
Staff Writer. D8i1y Ctdilornitur 

BERKELEY - A class on 
AIDS is being offered at UC 
Berkeley for the first time this fall . 

"AIDS in American SocietY,"a 
Democratic Education at Cal 
course sponsored by the peace 
and conflict studies program, will 
focus on a disease that is well 
known but poorly understood, 
according to junior Kim Toevs. 

"We want to eradicate the fear 
and anxiety around AIDS,"Toevs 
said. "Only homophobia comes 
from that ." 

Toevs, majoring in peace and 
conflict studies, is coordinating 
the class together with junior 
Damon Walcott, a genetics major. 

Walcott described the course as 

a "socio-political" analysis of the 
way AIDS has affected the Uni-
ted States. 

A few classes in other depart-
ments, such as psychology and 
biology, have touched on AIDS 
issues, Walcott said, but "no class 
has been specifically targeted to 
the interaction of AIDS and 
American society. " 

E~ch two-hour session will be 
devoted to an issue such as AIDS 
testing before marriage, religious 
stands on AIDS and discrimina-
tion in the workplace, Walcott 
said. 

Two sections will be offered,. 
each for 15 students. 

The class will feature guest 
speakers, including Paul Volberd-
ing, a UC San Francisco profes-
sor who discovered the AIDS 
epidemic, according to Walcott. 

Both Walcott and Toevs said 
they were interested in starting a 
class on AIDS because of their 
plans to become medical doctors. 

Toevs is also involved in the 
gay movement, and said she was 
concerned about the high level of 
apathy among her peers. 

"A lot of my friends are into the 
radical movement, but don't under-
stand how AIDS is 'a 'political 
issue," she said. 

Toevs said that one of the most 
pressing questions was whether 
employers should be alJowed to 
require that workers be tested for 
the AIDs virus. 

Students infected with AIDS 
who enrolled in the class would 
greatly benefit the other students, 
Walcott said. 

"I hope we can get their pers-
pective," he said. 

SCAM: Eight Defraud State 
Continued (rom pa.e I 
schools. Dan Parker of the Stu-
dent Aid Commission said the 
accused are people who "utilized 
their knowledge of how the sys-
tem works." 

According to Parker, Stern 
allegedly opened a bank account 
in his or a conspirator's name, 
and filed forged applications to 
get authorization for the loans. 

The Student Aid Commission 
was tipped off by a bank employee 

who was suspicious that a school 
employee should apply for a stu-
dent loan. 

The Commission, which ad-
ministrates the state and federal 
loa~ programs for California, 
receIVes 300 to 400 individual or 
institutional cases per year. It is 
also responsible for auditing the 
loan programs of the state's post-
secondary schools. 

"In all instances of illegal loan 
program activity, the Commission 

is aggressively seeking prosecu-
tion," Dr. Samuel M. Kipp lll, 
Student Aid Commission Execu-
tive Director, said. 

"The result is a $ 1.5 million sav-
ings and increased integrity for 
California's student loan pro-
grams." Kipp said . 

Kipp noted that 99.8 percent of 
the annual $875 million in state 
student loans are used for legiti-
mate educational purposes.

.. Thursday. Seplember 29. 1988 

A lot of people bitch about life turning weird on them, but most of their bitching is nonsense. There are only a handful of people in the world at any given 
time who know what "weird" really means, and the word is too fast and 
sharp and functional to be debased by casual yuppie usage. There are 
other words like "dumb" or "ugly" or "stressful" available to that 
crowd. They don't deserve an elegant word like Weird. 

But I have used it very comfortably for many years, if only for 
reasons of space ... My life has turned weird so many times that it 
seemed only natural when I finally began getting paid for it . 

The work of the truly Weird is almost always done at night, when 
Normal people are trying to relax. "The universal alertness level is 
lower at night ," my friend Edward Bennett Williams once explained to 
me. "It's a metabolic thing," he said . "People are lired at night. They 
eat , they loaf, they get drunk. Their guard always drops, if only just a 
little ... 

He laughed . "You can jump just about anybody at night, as long as 
you catch them alone." Then he stood up and smacked me on the 
shoulder, smiling like a wolverine ... "Except people like us," he added. 
"We're different, Doc ... Hell, I'd never jump you at night. No. It 
would be about 9:30 in the morning, fo r you." He burst into wild 
laughter and called for more whiskey. 

E d was evi~, in his way, but he had a good heart, and his brain was a thmg of beauty . It could move in three directions at 
once, always at full speed. There's one less great driver in the 

world, now that Ed Williams is gone . .. 
He died in August at the age of 68. The obituaries called him a 

"brilliant superlawyer." Which he was. He specialized in criminal 
matters involving the rich and the powerful and the doomed whose 
chances we.re utterly hopeless. He was the counsel of last resort, the 
fastest gun In the world, and he only took terminal cases. which he won 
with a consistency that awed his friends and demoralized his opponents. 

By the time he got bored with The Law and took up big-time sports, 
he was such a legend in the courtroom that even judges trembled when 
they saw his name on their dockets, and opposing lawyers wept. 

When Ed took a case, nobody else involved in it was going to get any 
sleep until they went to the final mattress . And probably not even then. 
There was always the possibility of a humiliating reversal when the case 
went up on appeal, which it always did . Ed understood the appeal 
process, which is mainly a question of " How high do you want to roll, 
brother? Are you sure you want to roll against ME?"Not many did. Ed 
walked alone, at the end. His last big victory was the 1988 Super Bowl, 
as president and managing director of the Washington Redskins, a 
flaky operation that had been his major hobby for almost 20 years. He 
also owned the Baltimore Orioles, but baseball was mainly a way to 
ward off boredom during the summer months, until football started 
again and he could get back to winning. 

Ed hated to lose. He was a player. He was one of us. He went to his 
grave wearing an NFL championship ring on one hand and clutching 
an iron-clad Personal Services contract with God in the other . . . or 
maybe the contract was with Lucifer, the fallen angel. Who knows? Ed 
never talked much about his contracts . All he knew and all he needed 
to know was that wherever he went, he would naturally be The 
Counsel. Edward Bennett Williams was a jewel, a man with the nerves 
of an assassin, the instincts of a smart gambler, and a talent so sharp 
that his enemies and victims were proud to be seen with him. 

M y agent had been calling about another weird jo b opportunity and I got to thinking about Ed, who would have liked this one ... the offer came from a profoundly 
exclusive Beverly Hills firm that represents the high side of the 
mushrooming Rent-A-Judge industry, one ofthe most lucrative gigs in 
the service sector. According to my agent, I could earn at least S500 per 
hour just for being honest; and she needed my final decision 
immediately. 

T he Honorable Hunter S. Thompson . . . why not? I was just about 
to sign the contract when the phone rang again. It was Skinner, calling 
from Washington, demanding to know whether there was any truth in 
the rumor that I had just been offered ajob as senior media consultant 
for the Dukakis for President Campaign. "It's all over town," he said. 
"Congratulations. Are you going to be traveling on the plane with 
him?" 

"Why not," I answered. 
There was a silence on the other end of the line. I could hear heavy 

breathing, and when he finaUy spoke, his voice was like a whisper. 
"Incredible," he hissed. "Incredible then it is true!" 

I said nothing. 
"Jesus," he said, "the poor bugger is more desperate than we 

though!. " 
"The numbers are grim," I said. "Bush is looking faster, funnier and 

meaner than ever before, and the Dukakis people can't handle: that 
kind of vicious speed. His mistake was getting involved with a tribe of 
whining P,encil-necks." 

"This is dacker than I'd imagined," he whispered, getting darker all 
the time . . . "Anything could happen now." 

In a business :-vhere you never leave home without a fistful of speed 
and a huge Halliburton full of money, the real difference comes down 
to r~ur staff people, how quick, how me~~ and how sharp they are. Ed 
Wilhams was a Democrat. He took politiCS seriously. He would have 
been embarrassed to be stuck with a candidate who couldn't even 
outsmart George Bush.

Parking Office 
Is a Thief 
Editor: 

This year, the UCSD Parking 
Office will sell over 10,000 student 
parking permits at $144.00. Ex-
cluding the substantial income 
the Parking Office stands to gain 
from the considerably more expen-
sive staff/ faculty parking, this 
amounts to over SI ,OOO,OOO. 

In the 1987-88 academic year, 
over 400 parking permits were 
reported stolen and almost 200 
vehicles were burglarized. How 
can the parking office justify its 
increase in rates when it does not 
even provide desperately needed 
security in the lots? 

As far as the students of UCSD 
are concerned , there is no distinc-

Parking Office and the thieves 
that roam the parking lots of this 
university.

comprehension that a university 
of such caliber, which should 
pride itself on the catering of 
necessities to its students, should 
be so oblivious, so ignorant as to 
undermine its patronage with such 
neglect . However, with the clo-
sure of Central Library's fifth 
floor typing room , a room which 
I rarely saw vacant and myself 
depended on, this atrocity has 

befallen us.

are the machines that used t(

Injunction 
Against the 
Regents? 

By BRIAN HILL 

So I was surprised that a 
number of people expressed en-
thusiasm concerning the last "Low 
Grade Beef," which argued that 
the UC Regents should have to 
face elections. Reader response 
increased 700 percent. Which is to 
say I received seven phone calls. 

Therefore, just a few more 
thoughts on getting the regents 
elected . 

Did you know that the state 
constitution requires that the 
regents "shall be able persons 
broadly reflective oft he economic, 
cultural and social diversity of the 
state, including ethnic minorities 
and women?" 

It says that . Are they? Well, 
nooooo, not even . . . remotely. But 
give them another chance: Wait 
until a strange wave of mutations 
caused by a pimple on the sun 
turns everyone in the state white, 
rich and over 60. Then they'l be 
representative. 

I agree with one reader who 
called to say he thinks it might be 
possible to get an injunction 
against the regents making any 
more decisions until they meet 
this diversity requirement. Im-
agine how they would react to 
that - babies get so infuriated 
when you take their rattle away. 

I'm trying to arrange for the 
papers serving each of the' UC 
campuses to run simultaneous 
editorials calling for regent elec-
tions. My editors are reallyenthu-
siastic about it, but one keeps fal-
ling asleep at the terminal while 
editing a story about your moth-
er's morals and the other one is 
investigating a tip that Elvis'fore-
skin may have been substituted 
for the O-ring in the doomed 
heroic flight of the space shuttle 
Challenger. 

Then I think someone, maybe 
you, because it's certainly not 
going to be me, should lobby the 
presidents of the student unions 
on each UC campus to introduce 
bills in support of regents elec-
tions. After that, a number of 
municipal elected officials and 
state legislators could be con-
vinced . . .. You get the idea. 

It's not a new idea. One reader 
brought in a SLATE pamphlet 
from 1963 calling for regents 
elections.

New Scripps Aquarium 
Approved by UC Regents 

By CHRISTINE OVERHOLT 
Contributing Wrilt!T 

Already a center of "interna-
tional si~nificance,~ the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography is 
expanding its premises and re-
organizing its displays. 

Recently, Scripps received ap-
proval from the Regents of the 
University of California at San 
Francisco to begin construction 
of a new aquarium-museum. 
scheduled to open in the Spring of 
1991. 

" It is a high quality program 
that is educational and caters to 
the San Diego community," Asso-
ciate Director of Scripps Tom 
Collins said. 

The proposed construction de-
sign will help Scripps fuifLU more 
effectively one of the primary 
purposes of its original chaner: to 
maintain a public museum. 

However, ColJins emphasized 
that Scripps is "not seeking to 
maximize the number of tour-
ists." Scripps has an estimated 
360,000 people from San Diego 
and around the world visit its 
facilities annuaUy. 

According to Scripps director 
Don Wilk.ie, the new museum is 
meant to "greatly expand 
[Scripps1 capabilities to serve San 
Diego as an educational and cui· 

Mode. - Shown above is the design for a new $7.6 million 
aquarium-museum at UCSD's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 

tural resource." 
Scripps upholds a level of edu-

cational activity through the high 
attendance ofiocaJ students attend-
ing tours and a large number of 
graduate students conducting re-
search there. 

The location of the new mu-
seum is at an elevation of 240 feet, 
overlooking the La JoUa Coast-
line and the rest of the Scripps 
Inst itiution. 

The museum will include a 
bookstore, an educational center, 
scenic overlooks, a man-made tide 
pool, as well as display areas and 
aquariums ranging up to 70,000 
gallons. 

$7.6 million has already been 

raised for the project through pri-
vate gifts and donations from a 
fundraising campaign during 
UCSD's twenty-fifth anniversary. 

However, this amount only 
covers the cost of the building's 
construction. An additional $.6 
million is needed for the interior 
decor and professionally made 
displays. Fundraising for these 
extra costs will begin after the 
completion of the facility. 

According to Collins the old 
museum will be closed to the pub-
lic, and wiH house a portion of 
Scripps' scientific collections, in-
cluding venebrate, invertebrate, 
fish, geological, and sediment 
samples.

ESReranto SReakers Travel the World 
Int' Tongue Destroys 
Language Barriers 
By ELEANOR CASTILLO 
Sraff Writer 

Driven by the desire to tear 
down the language barriers that 
promoted chaos and hatred be-
tween classes and races living in 
late nineteenth century Europe, a 
you ng Polish Jew created the lan-
guage called E peranto. Little did 
he know that his efforts would be 
credited ac ross the globe over one 
century after Esperanto's creation. 

Ludwik Zamenhofwas born in 
Bielstock, a territory between 
Poland and Lithuania. As a young 
child he grew up in a community 
of Poles, Germans, Jew and 
Russian . Each group spoke its 
own language, creating fear and 
distrust between the cultures. 

The solution: create a neutral 
la nguage t hat would satisfy all . At 

the age of 16, as a schoolboy in 
Warsaw, Zamenhof invented the 
international language, Esper-
anto. 

In 1887·, with the help of his 
father-in-law and his wife, Zamen-
hof published his first book. The 
work generated interest and drew 
supporters of his quest. 

Today, the language has spread 
to over 80 countrie . It is esti-
mated that a half million people 
speak E peranto. 

Esperanto consists of 28 letters 
(like the English alphabet, but 
without four letters which are 
replaced with six new letters). It is 
the simplest language to learn. 

Each letter has only one sound. 
In addition, Esperanto is based 
upon sixteen basic rules which are 
unchallenged by exceptions or 
irregularities. 

The language contains between 

Peter MeMI'obianl Guardian 

Dr. Ralph Lewin exchanges letters with Chinese and Russians . 

15,000 and 20,000 roots, with 
which over 150,000 words can be 
formed. 

"Just from reading a (lesson) 
book you can learn [Esperantol," 
said UCSD anthropology profes-
sor David Jordan. 

Jordan first came in contact 
with the language when in high 
school. Today, he serves as Presi-
dent of the San Diego Esperanto 
Deligito (chapter). 

"It's a marvelous language'" 
exclaimed Dr. Ralph Lewin, a 
marine biologist at Scripps Insti-
tute of Oceanography. He grew 
up speaking Esperanto. 

"I hated it at first," he said. "I 
thought it was silly." 

Lewin's passion for the lang-
uage came alive when he attended 
his first international conference 
as a young "lad" (he grew up in 
England). 

"We were on the train to Swit-
zerland," he recalled, "and it was 
so amazing that we could all 
speak and understand one anoth-
er. There were no barriers!" 

At this point we arrive at the 
question: Why hasn't Esperanto 
become the official international 
second language? 

"Look at the metric system," 
said Lewin. "Since its existence, it 
hasn't even crossed the Atlantic to 
the United States!"(In 1975 Con-
gress passed the Metric Conver-
sion Act, but it is 0 bvious that the 
metric system is not being widely 
used here). 

.Because English dominates num-
erous foreign countries, "Nobody 
needs it [Esperanto]. People learn 
something for only two reasons ," 
said Jordan. "They either have an 
investment in knowing it or they 
are curious about the subject." 

By the vast numbers of those 
who speak Esperanto, it does 
have its rewards. The countries 
one could write to and exchange 
information with are many. 

In his office, Dr. Lewin pulJed

out three envelopes. "Look, here 
are three letters I received today. 
All are written in Esperanto (one 
was from Madagascar, the other 
from China and the last from 
Moscow). 

"If Esperanto didn't exist, then 
I would have to learn each of 
those languages to communicate 
with those people,' , Lewin said. 

In addition to writing one 
another, Esperanto speakers enjoy 
traveling the globe and meeting 
other Esperanto enthusiasts.

porta Servo", they can stay in a

country. 

San Diego is the home of many 
Esperanto speakers. The language 
was first introduced here by Frank 
Helmuth . He came in contact 
with the language during his trav-
els in Europe. 

The first Esperanto class in San 
Diego was taught at San Diego 
High School in 1955. 

Charlotte Millson and her hus-
band, Wallace, first heard about 
Esperanto in 1974 (Wallace was a

Courses Examine Fridges and Soap Bubbles 
By DENNIS WOO 
Slaff Writer 

Somewhere on campus students 
are studying refrigerators and soap 
bubbles. No, they are not in classes 
about overeating and bath-taking. 
They are in one-unit seminar 
courses offered this quarter by 
different campus departments. 

"We're going to gct a good 
refrigeratol'," instructor David 
Miller said. "And we're going to 
put a leak in it. The students will 
have to find the leak and fix it." 

The potential damage of freon 
leaked into the atmosphere will 
also be discussed. Chemical com-
panies are seriously looking for 
aiternatives to fluids now used in 
refrigerators, according to Millcr. 

the back of the refrigerator is 
another common repair problem. 
In that case, a towel or a sock may 
have faUcn on the heat exchanger, 
or dirt may have collected on it, 
Miller explained. Students will 
learn to clean it off. 

Rubes® By Leigh Rubin 

In a course entitled "The Re-
frigerator" students are learning 
how a refrigerator works and how 
to make ret'airs of simple break-
downs, such as freon leaks. 

"We will be very careful not to 
discharge freon into the atmos-
pherewhen we'redoingtheexper-
iments in this course," Miller said. 

Miller says the course is a good 
way to get non-engineering stu-
dents to appreciate the kind of 
analysis that engineers do. The 
students will also learn-some basic 
physics and chemistry by study-
ing the cycles of refrigerators.

School). They began taking classes 
and wrote letters to delegates in 
order to meet other Esperanto 
speakers. 

Since 1983, Charlotte has 
volunteered to serve as the infor-
mation link to the community for 
the local chapter. Boasting ap-
proximately 70 members, the San 
Diego chapter is one of 14 deligi-
toy (chapters) existing in Califor-
nia. 

Although Esperanto is not the 
"universal~ language Zamenhof 
hoped it would be, its strength is 
evident by its survivaJ for 10 1 
years after its creation. 

The creator of this international 
language can be proud that it "has 
become a bridge between the 
races, (it is spoken in countries 
such as South Africa, Japan and 
Arabia as well as in the U.S. and 
Canada),"said Charlotte Millson 
with a smile. "The lallJU8ge knows 
no political or religious boundar-
ies. When we speak Esperanto, 
we are in Esperanto-land!" 

Anyone interested in learning 
Esperanto can take a class here at 
UCSD. It is taught in Linguistics 
19. 

Also, during winter quarter, 
Lewin will be giving a seminar on 
the language (contact Revelle 
College). Information can also be 
obtained by calling or writing the 
Esperanto chapter at 582-1968 or

Continued from paae 9 
titled "Soap Bubbles as a Serious 
Science," will engage students in 
the tradition of soap bubble 
science, which began in the time 
of Sir Isaac Newton. 

Seminars arc being spent 
observing the colors of soap bub-
bles and analyzing the bubble-
clustering effect of shaving cream 
foam . 

Professor Hassan Aref, a lec-
turer for the course, says studying 
the geometrics of bubbles gives 
insight into materials science and 
the structure of living cells. 

Professor MorteUl Gharib, also 
lecturing, will be demonstrating a 
device for observing the fluid flow 
of soap film. Gharib's device is 
driven by water running out of a

faucet. This relatively small and 
simple contraption allows him to 
conduct experiments similar to 
those currently performed in a 
large wind-tunnel. 

The bulk of the apparatus is 
built from dime-store parts - the 
soap film flows between two 
reshaped wire hangers. A laser is 
needed, however, to check the 
flow. 

One of the course highlights 
will be a demonstration of how 
oap film can be used as an analog 

computer by stretching it across a 
wire frame. Such a device solves 
the so-called "traveling salesman" 
exercise (a common beginning 
computer science problem) even 
more accurately than an electronic 
computer.

SHARE Feeds the Hungry 
By ADAM LEVY 
Staff Writer 

Recently, due to the upcoming 
presidential election, the plight of 
the hungry and destitute in Amer-
ica has once again emerged as a 
potent political issue. A non-profit 
organization called SHARE 
offers a solution that is apol-
itical, costs tax-payers nothing 
and has proved effective in com-
bating hunger in the U.S. (as well 
as in Mexico and Guatemala). 

On the nationwide level, 
SHARE operates on the last Sat-
urday of every month. The organ-
ization distributes food to thou-
sand of people in 13 citie~ inclu~­
ing San Diego, Ph?emx, Bir-
mingham, San FranCISco and the 
Bronx, as well as in cities of the 
Midwest and New Jersey. SHARE 
works to supplement meager diets 
with low-cost food. 

Participation in the program 
requires onJy $12 and two hours 
of community service. Many 
volunteers use their two hours of 
service to help in the much needed 
process of packing the food. Oth-
ers help with community projects 
or other activities aimed at im-
proving life. 

Participants, in return, receive 
a food package valued at 530-35. 
It usually weighs about 40 pounds 
and includes staple foods like 
chicken, beef, turkey, pasta, vege-
tables and fruits. More than one 
food package can be purchased, if 
so desired. 

One participant said the pack-
ages hold over many families at 
the end of the month when cash 
becomes scarce. 

The program is not restricted 
to the needy. "Anyone can qualify 
for the program," said Betty 
Barber, a member of the adminis-
'trative team. The purpose of the 
program, Barber added, is to 

enhance the quality of life. 
The concept behind the pro-

gram emphasizes community in-
volvement and self-reliance. 

"SHARE i not a charity and 
not a government program," rea~s 
a SHARE flyer. "The program IS 
powered by the ~alizalion th.at 
spiritual and phYSical hunger eXist 
needlessly and that people are 
their own best resource." 

Sponsored by the Roman Cath-
olic Diocese, the program is lar-
gely run at the local level. Local 
organizations like churches, 
schools, hospitals and unions par-
ticipate as "hosts" and provide the 
local administrative tools to im-
plement the program. 

The "host" organizations are 
responsible for collecting the 
money of participants and for 
making sure that community ser-
vice is carried out. 

The hosts are aJso responsible 
for picking up the food from the 
warehouse and bringing it to the 
host organizations where partici-
pants can pick up their food 
packages. 

The administrative and coor-
dinating team consists of a hand-
fuJ of people who are responsible 
for buying the food. The money is 
pooled together and the food is 
bought in bulk directly from the 
producer. 

"Every attempt is made," said 
one adminstrator," to buy the best 
quality food at the lowest price." 
Some food producers donate food 
or offer it at a lower than usual 
price. 

Presently there are three people 
on the staff who buy the food. 
However, expansion and interest 
in the program is so biSh, said 
executive director Andy Morik-
awa, that the numben of buyers 
will be increased to five. 

Sue Ellen Sorenson, also a di-
rector of the program, although 

comparing it in ome respects to a 
co-op, emphasized the driving 
force of energy and good will that I 
the program generates. 

"Wedon"t liketocall ita co-op, 
that's more of a business ... the I 
food is part of it, but it's more I 
spirited than that, "Sorenson said . 

The program has enjoyed tre-
mendous success, she added . 
Started in 1983 in San Diego by 
Deacon Carl Shelton, the pro-
gram helped only a few thousand 
people. Last yearthe program has 
expanded to reach more than 
142,000 families, and distributed 
33 million pounds of food in 
1987. 

SHARE also contributes inter-
nationally, operating in Guatem-
ala and Mexico. The international 
aspect of SHARE works closely 
with the Agency for International 
Development or Aid. 

Food is obtained for this pro-
gram from government-b~ugh 
U.S . surplus and sometimes 
private donations. Since most of 
the Mexican and Guatemalan 
people involved in the program 
have little money, they only pay 
$.35 for their food package. In 
addition to the smalJ fee. recipients 
of SHARE food packages must 
work on community projects like 
roads, sanitation systems and 
other public works. 

SHARE also provides some 
vocational training in an attempt 
to provide a more permanent 
solution for the needy recipients. 

The best thing about SHARE, 
commented Andy Morikawa, is 
"the tremendous spirit of com-
munity" that one finds there. 

This richness ofspirit, he added, 
helps people from becoming home-
less and destitute by "standing as 
a preventive measure ... and pro-
viding an overriding sense of 
cooperation, trust, self-help and 
caring."

Year of the Finger 
By 1. BERESFORD-HOWE 
Opinion Edilor 

It was the Year of the Finger: 
Bob Ojeda lost his, Chub Feeney 
shared his with the world and got 
fired for it, and Tony Gwynn's 
couldn't stop him from winning 
another batting championship in 
the sadly demeaned National 
League. 

Ojeda, who presumabiy could 
afford a gardener, nearly sheared 
his fingers off a couple of weeks 
ago, thus depriving the Mets of 
their best big game pitcher and 
giving the Dodgers a chance to 
win, say, one game before find ing 
deserved obscurity as one of the 
worst divisional winners ever. 

Chub Feeney, way, way, past 
his prime-which wasn't great in 
the first place- had a lost and frus-
trated season and finally shared 
his good wishes for the crowd on 
Fan Appreciation Day here in 
San Diego by giving the finger to 
two swinish La Jolla businessmen 
carrying a "Dump Chub" or 
"Scrub Chub" or some other bull-
shit bedsheet banner through the 
crowd. 

second); Kansas City is in the top 
third and Texas and Chicago are 
poised to make big leaps upward 
in the standings. Even Seattle , 
with Mark Langston as one ofthe 
best fi ve pitchers in baseball , can 
make noise from time to time. 

Only the disorganized and con-
fused Angels, who, in this age of 
collusion, can not be expected to 
bail themselves out with huge free 
agent cash infusions, have no 
prospects of improvement. 

The American League East is 
in trouble. The Yankees will never 
be better than they are from right 
now until a couple of years after 
that pig George Steinbrenner 
finally sells them. 

The Tigers, finally losing super-
star performances from Alan 
Trammell, Lou Whitaker and 
Jack Morris, and the Blue Jays 
will probably clean house and 
start over. Look for several "Jays 
Visit Player in Rehab" stories in 
the off-season. The Indians and 
the Orioles will be forever wret-
ched and the Brewers are doing it 
with mirrors. 

What do the playoffs hold? The 
Red Sox, behind Clemens and 
Hurst, will upset the A's, whose 
starting pitching is the weakest of 
the four teams, while the Mets 
ream the Dodgers. 

In the World Series, the Red 
Sox, thirsting for revenge, will 
find someone to replace Bill 
Buckner as goat and lose in six

SOCIOLOGY 159 
The Asian-American Experience 
Tues./Thurs. 2:30-3:50 pm 
Humanities Undergraduate 0236 
This is an introductory course which 

FALL explores the varying experiences of Asians 
in the United States. We will look at the 
images and stereotypes of Asians, issues of 
ethnic identity, and racial discrimination 
and prejUdice, political movements and 

1988 Asian-American culture . 

Gwynn is the best hitter in the 
National League. A finger that 
would have caused many of us to 
give up racquetball or fumbling 
around in car seats, did nof stop 
him from apparently cruising to 
another National League batting 
championship, despite a degraded 
average that willlanej somewhere 
around .315, the lowest league-
leading batting average ever. ;-----,---------------------' ... -----------

There are a lot of theories about 
why pitching is so dominant in 
the National League this year. 
Some people will tell you it's the 
weather-a colder-than usual sum-
mer in most NL cities has a 
proven effect on averages. 

I personally blame the White 
Rat, St. Louis manager Whitey 
Herzog. His marginal success with 
a "sequential offense," a bunch of 
fast people with no bats - end-
lessly bunting, stealing and leg-
ging out infield hits - has con-
vinced GMs in Montreal, San 
Diego, San Francisco, Cincinnati, 
Pittsburgh, and Chicago (!) that 
the Earl Weaver two walks-and-
a-homer offense is useless. 

Averages aren't down as much 
as On Base Percentage is - some 
tearns, like the indescribably bad 
Atlanta Braves, barely have two 
regulars with OBP's over a wret-
ched .300 . 

No power and a bunch of guys 
trying to punch out scratch hits 
makes the National League pro-
duce the most boring possible 
brand of baseball. 

Finally, one oft-noted effect is 
that ofthe lack oCa DR in the NL. 
Every minor league uses the DH, 
so the N L gets new generations of 
pitchen every year who have never 
swung then bat in their life. It's 
finally caught up with them. 

Whereas pitchers used to hit 
. 1 SO to .170, many teams now 
have whole groups of pitchers 
who can't manage .100. Power 
hitting by pitchers, once impor-
tant in the days of Tony Clonin-
ger, Bob Gibson and Juan Mari-
chal (at least against the Dodgen), . 
is completely gone, 

The American League, on the 
other hand, hu produced a new 
powerhouse division - the AL 
West. The A's and Twins are, 
arguably, 1-3 in ability among all 
major league teams (with the Mets

Rugby Heads for Third 
Consecutive Championship 

If you have ever passed by 
Muir Field on a Saturday after-
noon, you might have seen a 
game played which was part 
football, soccer, and hockey. After 
watching for a few minutes, you 
would know that this could only 
be the UCSD rugby team. Not 
only is it the oldest spon on cam-
pus, but also the only other 
organized contact sport aside 
from lacrosse. 

Established in 1960, the club 
has won over 280 games, in addi-
tion to capturing many presti-
gious tournaments. In character 
with this winning tradition, UCSD 
has gone undefeated in league 
play and has taken the Southern 
California Collegiate Champion-

Finger 
Continued from pale 13 

games. A good potential goat is 
rookie shortstop Jody Reed; also 
check Rich Gedman to see how 
tightly his fingers are wrapped 
around his throat. 

One sad consequence of the 
Ojeda injury is that it kills a 
potential Hurst-Ojeda World Se-
ries matchup in Game Two; it 
would have been lost in the Cle-
mens Gooden hype, but Hurst-
Ojeda are two of the smartest, 
most thoughtful and interesting 
pitchers around. Watching NBC's 
su perior handling of baseball and 
those two work would have been 
a pleasure. 

ship two years in a row. 
Accumulating an overall re<:urd 

of 28-7, the highlight of last sea-
son came with a 31-6 crushing of 
Occidental College in the cham-
pionship match. 

This year's squad of young 
"ruckers" will return to the rugby 
pitch looking for a repeat of that 
successful season. 

Leading the team this year is 
veteran fullback John Tillenback, 
who was named to the Southern 
California representative side last 
year, and went on to play at the 
national level with the Junior 
Grizzlies. The Triton backline will 
get a lot of help from returning 
scrum half Stanley Bar and hard-
hitting Danny Schliefer. 

According to head coach Tom 
Butler, the chances of winning the 
So. Cal championships for the 
third year in a row look quite 
promising. 

"This year we've got a lot of 
good players, and I feel that with 
our schedule and caliber of play 
we will win the title again," Butler 
said. 

The impressive UCSD rugby 
schedule includes opposition from 
as far away as New Zealand, Aus-
tralia, and England, plus the regu-
lar out-of-state tournaments, 
including one in Houston, Texas. 

The team is still looking for 
anyone who is interested in partic-
ipating. Call Tom Butler at 259-
2491 for more information. 

DON'T FORGET ... 
.• . the fifth annual BGIF (Blue-Gold Incred-

ible Friday) is coming up this Friday. The day 
features men's water polo games at 3 p.m. and 
6 p.m., a men's soccer game at 3:30 p.m., and a 
women's volleyball game at 7 p.m. The day's 
events will be topped off by a performance of 
the Untouchables on the hump after the vol-
leyball game.

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... Anytime UCSD is com-
peting against a Division I team in any sport, it is 
practicaUy assured that the Tritons will have to put 
forth their highest caliber of play in order to overtake 
the opponent. Saturday's game against Division I Cal 
State Long Beach at 6:00 p.m. in Canyonview Pool is 
no exception, especially considering the fact that 4-4 
Cal State Long Beach is currently ranked fIfth in the 
country. Nevertheless, it will be a home game for the 
7-7 Tritons, and ranked eighth in the country, they 
will certainly be no pushover. In addition, it will be 
free poster night and that probably means there will 
be hundreds of fans, all cheering for UCSD. There-
fore, PHIL advises you to ...

nevik was qu ick to praise Men-
dez's performance. " Her play was 
far superior to that of a ny other 
player on t he court," Dannevik 
stated in a post-game interview. 
"We would have had a better 
chance to win without her there ... 

Nevertheless, the tea m did 
accomplish t heir original goals of 
scoring in double figures and forc-
ing the Aztecs to call the first 
timeout of the match. Not only 
did the Tritons do that. but they 
actually managed to steal one 
game from the 10th ranked Aztecs. 

Leading the way for the Tritons 
was Dia na Klintworth, who came 
up with 17 timely kills a nd 16 
digs. Rachel Vetter also performed 
well offensively with 12 kills . but 
committed nine c~stly errors. 

San Diego State overpowered 
the Tritons by domi nating net 
play. While UCSD managed only 
two block assists and 38 total 
kills, the Aztecs compiled 14 block 
assists and slammed home 52 
kills. 

Friday, the Tritons will battle 
t he tough Biola Eagles in t he gym 
at 7 p.m.

For several years the students 
and faculty of UCSD's music 
department have demanded more 
extensive cultural programming. 
The music department cites a 
need for more cultural perform-
ances and classes. Students have 
also been frustrated with the exist-
ing programa. After teaming the 
UCSD music' department with 
the Univeraity Event Office's 
Musical Programming committee, 
a viable and exciting response to 
these demands has arrived. 

The result of this collaboration 
is a new cultural music cia .. and a 
new series of cultural music con-
certs. The course, World Music 
( 13), will investipte the music of 
Africa. Asia, America, The Far 
East, and Latin America. In addi-
tion to the regular lectures, the 
students will be required to attend 
five concerts being presented by 
the University Events Office in 
Mandeville Auditorium. Follow-
ing the performances. the artists 
will lecture and answer questions 
from the class. Though the con-
certs are designed around the class • 
students, staff, and community 
members are highly encouraged to 
artend. 

The first of these concerts will 
be staged Tuesday. October 4 , 
and will highlight the African 
Marima Ensemble. Dumi and 
Minanzi Ill. Hailing from Zim-
babwe, Africa, Dumi is considered 

us 

the foremost instructor and per-
former of mbira (often called 
thumb piano), marimba, Shona 
singing, and African dance and 
drumming. Sinte coming to the 
United States in 1968 to teach 
edmomusicology at the Univer-
sity of Washington. Seattle, Dumi 
has traveled extensively in the 
U.S., teaching and performing the 
traditional music of Zimbabwe. 
Recently returning to Seattle for 
his Ph. D. after a prominant stay in 
his native Zimbabwe as Director 
of Recreation in the Ministry of 
Youth, Sport. and Culture and as 
Deputy Secretary of Culture, 
Dumi has recorded a new album, 
Mwe,a, and is touring the U .S. as 
Dumi and Minanzi Ill. 

The marimba ensemble will 
dJ light UCSD with its joyous 
African mUlic Tuesday night. and 
follow with a guest lecture appear-
ance in the World Music (13) 
cia .. on Wednesday. 

Though the collaboration of 
live performance and traditional 
coursework is new to UCSD, the 
class was filled immediately. In 
Older to meet this demand. the 
music department has offered a 
second section which still has sev-
eral openings. 1he concerts will all 
take place in Mandeville Audit~ 
rium and tickets are available at 
the UCSD box office. Don't miss 
out on this chance to share a rare 
and culturally mo ving experience. 

Second City, the touring group 
of Chicago's famed comedy thea-
tre, will appear one night only on 
Oct. 3 in Mandeville at 8 pm. 

The face of American comedy 
was changed 25 years ago when 
Second City became the parent of 
improvisation. Since then. each 
decade has brought a wave of such 
notables as Mike Nichols, Elaine 
May and Ed Alner, followed by 
Jerry Stiller. Joan Rivers, Shelly 
Berman, Anne Meara. and Alan 
Arkin, and later by Dan Aykroyd, 
Gilda Radner , and the Belushi 
brothera. 

From Second City in Chicago 
and Toronto came the first head-
liners for the television show 
"Saturday Night Uve" with Bill 

Murray, Radner, Akyroyd. and 
Belushi. Second City also fueled 
the television series "SCTV 
Comedy Network," produced by 
the Toronto chapter. The show 
was aired by NBC in the late-
Friday-night slot. Movies also felt 
the influence of Second City 
theatre, with such films as "Animal 
House," "Meatballs." "Stripes." 
and "Cadd~ack." 

Tickets for the Second City 
TOUring Company are on sale at 
the UCSD Box Office (534-4559)

Piece together parts of ska, soul, 
rap, reggae and the ability to make 
almost anyone dance, and you 
have created the Untouchables. 

Since their formation in 1981 , 
the well dressed sextet has earned 
the reputation of the ultimate party 
band. Becoming one of the most 
sought-after bands for college 
campus events, the Untouchables 
will return to UCSD tomorrow 
night to climax the annual Blue 
and Gold Incredible Friday. 

The Untouchables 
• Don't miss them on 

Friday, Sept. 30 on 
the gym steps 

c 

couple of Singles, most predomi-
nantly, the club favorite, "Free 
Yourself" which won the 1984 
Billboard Award for Best Inde-
pendent Video. "Free Yourself" 
helped the Untouchables land their 
first official record contract. 

Their debut album, "Wild 
Child" spawned the hits, " I Spy 
For the FBI," "What's Gone 
Wrong," and included the already 
successful "Free Yourself." The 

acclaim generated from "Wild 
Child" allowed guitarist Clyde 
Grimes, singers Chuck Askemeese 
and Jerry Miller, vocalist Tony 
Brewster, drummer Willy Dred 
McNeil and bassist Derek Break-
field to tour Europe and Japan 
extensi vel y. 

Sinct. then, the Untouchables 
ha ve gone on to criss-cross the 
U.S. numerous times headlining 
and opening for bands such as 
UB40, Psychedelic Furs, and X. 
Their success on college campuses 
even earned them a headlining 
role on the Spin/MTV college 
tour last fall and during the 
Daytona Beach Spring Break 
Concerts. 

For anyone who hasn't yet heard 
the Untvuchables, Friday's perfor-
mance will be an uplifting exper-
ience. For those who know them 
the show will be an energetic 
riveting showcase of the songs 
you've come to love. Excited and 
thrilled, UCSD welc;omes back 
the Untouchables. 

Symphony season 
sounds smooth 

by phil macgovern 
hiatus writer 

One of the more cultural events 
of the UCSD community, the La 
Jolla Civic-U niversity Symphony, 
opens the 1988-1989 season with 
a tribute to the glorious music of 
Ludwig van Beethoven. 

This" All-Beethoven Concert" 
will be presented Saturday, Octo-
ber 1 at 8 pm and Sunday, October 
2 at 3 pm. Both shows are in the 
Mandeville Auditorium. The or-
chestra is under the direction of 
Music Director Thomas Nee, and 
the Choral Conductor is David 
Chase. 

Some of the most good-natured 
works of Beethoven have been 
chosen to open the Symphony's 
35th season. The program opens 
with the "Symphony No. 8 if F 
major, " which is sometimes re-
ferred to as the "humorous" 
symphony, a reference to the 
"overflowing high spirits" of Bee-
thoven at the time it was written. 

rhythmic music." 
She continues, "Beethoven 's 

musIC tells a lot about the state of 
the human soul." 

Next is "The Choral Fantasy" 
for piano, orchestra and chorus. 
This piece features award-winning 
pianist Kenneth Bookstein. 

The last piece, rivall ing the 
"1812 Overture" in percussion, is 
"Wellington's Victory," written 
in honor of King George IV after 
England's victory in the Battle of 
Vittoria. 

The season contines on No-
vember 19 and 20 with a concert 
featuring some famous works of 
the 1920s. Later shows include 
pieces by Mozart and Mahler, a 
Christmas Concert and then con-
cludes on June 4 with the Young 
Artist's Concert. 

Originating as a Ska/ Mod band 
in Los Angeles, the Untouchables 
quickly gained enough recognition 
to land the role of house band at 
the legendary Roxy Theatre. Their 
successful live performances in-
spired the band to record an 
independently produced LP and a These fun guys will supply the rowdy dance tunes for this Friday's BGIF. 

Susan Rands, the manager of 
the La Jolla Symphony, recom-
mends the Beethoven perfor-
mance. She says, "It's a good 
introduction to more unusual 
music, and it is likely to appeal to 
people because it is very tuneful, 

For more information, call the 
La Jolla Symphony Association at 
534-4637. Tickets are available 
through the UCSD Box Office, 
534-4559, 10 am to 5 pm Mon-

W hen someone comes over to Bill Weiser's house, first comments are always about the multitude of pottery that 
decorates every available space, The fifth year biochemistry/ cell 
biology students makes pots, planters, vases and lamps that are· 
created with a talented but simple style; one that allows the 
medium to express itself, instead of hiding the clay within a 
specific design. When asked about his style, Weiser commented, 
"My style of pottery was influenced greatly by Ed Thompson and 
Kenichi Saito, professional potters whom I met through the craft 
center." 

Bill Weiser creates pottery that is functional above all else, but 
lately he has been interested in making Raku pots and vases. Raku 
is a Japanese style of fast firing the pottery in which the hot piece is 
thrown into a trash can lined with newpaper, The hot pottery 
piece creates a bonfire in the trash can. The fire cracks the plate 
while the smoke colors the crack less gray. Or, if the glaze has a lot 
of copper in it the Raku technique creates a swirl y metallic design, 
Raku work is delicate and is not functional. However, much of 
Bill's work is functional ware, with rich dark colors and beautiful 
designs. 

Bill Weiser will be Artist of the Month atthe Grove Gallery this 
February. Stop by to see some of his work on display there now,

cassette, or compact disc in srock with your entry! Remember to

thinking caps on, and good luck!
