United States Issues 
More Warnings to China, 
Finally Apologizes 

WASHI GTON - Striking a 
slightly stiffer tone with China, the 
Bush administration warned 
Beijing on Sunday that its rela-
tionship with the United States 
was already being hurt and that it 
risked further harm with every day 
that the crew of an American spy 
plane remained in detention . 

Senior U.S. officia ls again firm-
ly rejected the kind of apology that 
China has demanded for the colli-
sion between the American plane 
and a Chinese fighter jet on April

Limits of Court Tested 
By California Utility

LOS A GELES - When the 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. filed 
for bankruptcy protection Friday, 
a shudder swept through corpo-
rate suites across the nation . • 

Not only is California's largest 
utility directly challenging the 
authority and power of regulators to 
set retail rates, but it is testing the 
reach of the federal bankruptcy 
judge overseeing a case unprece-
dented in its scope, said industry

U. Michigan Law 
Admissions Ruling Could 
Go to Supreme Court 

LOS A GELES - A federal 
judge halted the use of affi rmative 
action at the University of'" 
Michigan 's law school March 29. 

The university plans to take the 
case to the U.S. Supreme Coun, and 
if it succeeds, the decision could 
determine the fate of affirmative 
action in admissions nationwide. 

What makes the case unique is 
that the University of Michigan's 
undergraduate affirmative action 
program was recently determined 
to be constitutional by another 
federal court judge.

UCSD Admits More Underrepresented Students 
2001 Admissions Statistics demonstrate a ri se in the number of applications and acceptances 
By MAn SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD, often criticized for a 
lack of diversity, increased its 
admittance of underrepresented 
students by 16.6 percent this year, 
as the total number of applicants 
reached an all-time high. 

As a result of Proposition 209, 
students of ethnic backgrounds 
are not given advantages in getting 
into UCSD. Proposition 209 ends 
all affirmative action practices in 
hiring, firing, admissions and con-
tract awards have been illegal in 
California state-funded organiza-
tions for over two years. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor 
Richard Backer said that the high-
er number of underrepresented 
students is an indication of the 
higher caliber of applicants overall. 

"For both African-Americans 
and Mexican-Am~ricans, the 
response is the same," he said about 
why he thinks there was an increase 
in African-American admissions. 
He also attributed thl:: higher num-
bers to the increasing popularity of 
the campus. Backer also said that 
students are becoming better pre-
pared for a UCSD education. 

Admittance of African-
Americans increased to 239, up 
16.6 percent from last year. Latino 
admittance is up to 379, which is 
an increase of 17 perceht. 

Admittance . of ative 
Americans decreased by 8.S per-
cent to 55. Backer said this is 
nothing to be alarmed about, as 
the decrease in statistics is not an 
accurate representation of a 
change in the number of Native 
Americans at this school. 

Because the number of Native 
American applicants is already 
low, any small increase or decrease 
has a large effect on percentages. 

" ative Americans do not have 
the college-going tradition of other 
groups," Backer said. "We have been 
more aggressive in the last two years 
to change that by visiting reserva-
tions more frequently." 

However, the increased per-
centage of underrepresented stu-
dents is only a small part of what 
the admissions data suggests 
about UCSD's changing ways. 

UCSD received 38,161 applica-
tions, the second highest in the UC 
system this year. More than 16,300 
students were admitted this year, 
breaking last year's record by more 
than 2,600 students. 

"We get so many applications 
because we are a great university 

in a great location that provides a 
first -rilte education and soci,1I 
experience," Backer sa id. 
"Students want to be here." 

The school expects a lower per-
centage of those admi tted to regis-
ter this year, and is planlllng on a 
freshman class of 3,850 sllldents. 
There were 2,600 more students 
admitted this year than last yea r, 
with only 650 additional spots. 

In addition , the 4.04 average 
GPA of those admittcd is an indi-
ca tion that UCSD has reached the 
academic level of other prestigious 
and academica lly celebrated 
schools. 

"We are attracting a higher cal-
iber of student who also conSider 
UCLA, Cal , the Ivies, Stanford, 
etc.," Backer said.

BRIEFLY 
Ocean Wanning Traced to Humans 

Tim Barnett and David Pierce. researchers at 
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, have 
recently pinpointed global warming in the upper 
3,000 meters of the ocean to human beings 
rather than natural causes. 

The researchers found that obse'rved global 
ocean temperature rose along with climate 
model taken from the U.S. developed Parallel 
Climate Model , indicating that global warming 
could be attributed to man·made causes. 

This finding applies to all of the world 's 
oceans and wil l be published in the April 13 
issue of the journal Science. 

The study results will also help measure the 
accuracy of computer climate computer models. 

The study was funded by the Nat ional 
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Associat ion 
Climate Change Data and Detection Program 
and the U.S. Department of Energy Office of 
Energy Research. 

Regents Appoint David Russ 
as UCSD's New Treasurer 

The UC Regents appointed David H. Russ as 
their new treasurer and vice president for invest-
ments last week . 

Russ formerly served as the public markets 
managing director for the University of Texas 
Investment Management Company and replaces 
Patricia A. Small , who resigned in August after 
serving on the post for five years. 

Russ will begin his new position June 1, 
2001. 

At the University of Texas Investment 
Management Company, where he has worked 
since 1997, Russ was responsible for all global 
publ icly traded investments and alternative mar-
ketable assets, among other things. 

Russ ' other experiences include his tenure 
both as director of investment management and 
portfol io manager for Pac ific Telesis Group and 
as a portfolio manager for Stanford Management 
Company, which is in charge of all of Stanford 
University's investments. 

UCSD Physicists Verify 
Snell Law Reversing Material 

Physic ists at UCSD have verified the first of a 
set of composite materials that they believe 
would reverse the behavioral characterist ics of 

fundamental electromagnetic properties. 
The scientists discovered that electromag-

netic radiation travels through the new material 
in a manner never witnessed before. The new 
material could be instrumental in creating new 
kinds of antennas and also a "per fect lens' that 
could focus light and other radiation in a way 
that no other lens can. 

The researchers findings were published in 
the April 6 issue of Science. 

The composite material differs from ordi· 
nary materials in that it bends electromagnet-
ic radiation in the opposite direction while 
ordinary materials deflect light in the same 
direction; it possesses a negative index of 
refract ion . 

The researchers have filed for a patent for 
their new material. Their study was supported by 
the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency and the Air Force Office for Science 
Research, which are investigating potential 
applications. 

Bingham Scholarships to Help 
Students Working on Campus 

The Darcy and Robert Bingham Endowed 
Scholarships, "Helping Students who are

Six scholarships of $1,500 each will be 
awarded to students in the 2001-2002 academ-
ic year. 

The Darcy Bingham Recreation Student 
Employee Scholarship will be awarded to an 
undergraduate student employed by UCSD 
Student Recreation. 

The Bingham Student Affairs Student 
Employee Scholarships will be awarded to two 
undergraduate students employed by Student 
Affairs. 

The Bingham UCSD Student Employee 
Scholarships will be awarded to three UCSD stu-
dents employee by any campus department.

~D & NATION 
D.C. Lobbyists, Congressional Allies 
Concerned About Budget Proposal 

WASHINGTON - Even before the formal 
release on Monday of President Bush's detailed bud-
get and the cuts it would make in various domestic 
programs, influential constituencies have begun to 
howl in protest. 

BUI Vice President Dick Cheney warned Congress 
on Sunday not to go too far in restoring spending 
programs, saying that Bush WQuid reject spending 
that he viewed as excessive. 

"The president has the right to veto appropria-
tions, and this president is eager to veto appropria-
lions that come in over budget," Cheney said on the 
ABC program "This Week." "If Congress is going to 
pass porked- up appropriations measures, they will 
run Into a veto." 

In rckasing his $1.96 trillion budget on Monday, 
Bush will propose cutS in corporate subsidies and in 
some housing, health and social welfare programs. 
. Thl' Whllc. House say~ the cuts are needed to put 
federal spending on a more sustainable path after 
sevcral years of rapid growth. But some members of 
Congress from each party have objected that the cuts 
are needed mainly to help offset the cost of the large 
tax cuts that Bush has been seeking. 

Lobbyists, having learned many of the details, are 
mobilizing efforts - with their allies in Congress -
to preserve or expand the programs. 

The presidcnt will. for example, propose eliminat-
ing federal loan guaran tees for people who buy com-
mercial ships built in AI1)crica n shipyards. But the 
American Shipbuilding Association is determined to 
get $100 million of loan guarantees this year, and it 
I:as lined up support from powerful Republicans 
from coastal states like MiSSissippi (Sen. Trent Lott) , 
LOUISiana (Rep. Billy Tauzin) and Alaska (Sen. Ted 
Stevens) .

and the Amencan Academy of Pediatrics have joined

dn:n 's programs. Tht: administration wal1ls to trim

cuts, including one to slice $700 million from a pro-
gram for construction ~nd repair of public housing. 

A Wide range of bUSinesses are scrambling to pro-
tect the Expon-Import Bank from cuts that will be 
proposed by Bush. Defenders of the bank include the 
US. Chamber of Commerce, the National

Former Shoeshine Boy Leads Polls 
In Peru Vote, Runoff Appears Likely 

LI 1A, Pertl - Alejandro 
Toledo, the former shocshinc 

bo~' who climbed out of poverty 
to lead the opposition against· 
former President Alberto 
Fujimori, stood close to winning 
the presidency on Sunday. But 
he appeared to fall short of the 
majority requi red to avert a 
runoff. 

An exit poll indicated that 
Toledo had won 40.1 percent of 
the vote. followed by former 
Presiden t Alan Garcia , a leftist 
populist, with 24.3 percent, and 
former Congresswoman Lourdes 
Flores, a moderat~ conservative, 
with 22.8 percent. Four other 
candidates trailed badly. 

Toledo, who stands ideologi-
cally between Garcia and Flores, 
stands to pick up the majority of 
votes of either of his rwo princi-
pal opponents in a runoff unless 
voters begin to show more in ter-

China: 
Officials have hinted at 
souring foreign relations 
Continued from page 1

States would not give up its right to 
conduct such eavesdropping 
flights. 

"The relationship is being dam-
aged," Secretary of State Cohn 
Powell warned on Fox News 

he had used drugs and aban-
doned an illegitimate daughter. 

The voting was orderly, in 
contrast with last year's. Toledo 
strongly challenged Fujimori and 
might have beaten him had it not 
been for th e open support the 
former president received from 
the armed forces and an election 
apparatus and tabloid and televi-
sion news media largely con-
trolled by his government's intel-
ligence operation. 

While there were reports of 
polls opening late and computer 
software problems before the 
balloting, there were no reports 
this year of co nvicts voting ille-
gally, ballots mangled to exclude 
Toledo's name or ballots fi lled in 
before they were distributed . 
And unlike last year, the tally 
sheets did not disappear mysteri-
ously for hours. 

"Everything is going perfect-
Iy," said Prime Minister Javier 

Sunday. "The damage can be 
undone, but in order for the dam-
age to be undone al)d no further 
damage to occur, we've got to bring 
this matter to a close as soon as 
possible." 

Bu! i1Pparently in an effort to 
mollify the Chinese, Powell used a 
slightly different formulation to the 
"regret" expressed last week and 
said for the first time that 
Washington was "sorry" about the 
loss of the Chinese pilot, who e 
plane crashed in the South China

secretary-general who took 
office in a transitional govern-
ment put in place by Congress 
after Fujimori fl ed the co untry 
and resigned in ovember. 
"Everyone is voting freely with- ; 
out imposition." 

None of the major candidates 
or international observers 
reported serious voting prob-
lems, and the transition govern-
ment appea red to be enti rely 
neutral in an election that was 
viewed as vital for the consolida-
tion of civilian democracy, not 
only in Peru but for the entire 
region . 

"This is a great celebration; 
said a relaxed Toledo, 55, after he 
cast his vote in a Lima school 
Sunday morning. "It's been a 
long and hard fight."

Internet Porn Business 
Still 'Going Strong 

With the dark clouds of hard 
times filling the skies, many high-
technology companies are dltting 
back and hunkering down. But 
some brave entrepreneurs are con-
tinuing to innovate. Take Duocash, a 
New York company that is pursuing 
·one of the fondest longtime dreams 
of technology entrepreneurs and 
privacy advocates alike: anonymous, 
secure payments over the Internet. 

One of the biggest stumbling 
blocks for such systems so far has 
been to come up with a form of 
online cash that businesses and 
customers will actually use. 
Duocash has found a way around 
the problem - it uses prepaid tele-
phone long-distance cards, a sys-
tem already in widespread use. 

And what was the first Web 
company to sign up with 
Duocash? Entertainment etwork 
Inc., which runs thousands of so-
called "adult" sites. 

The interest of an adult-enter-
tainment company should come as 
no surprise, according to Bruce 
Fancher, the vice president for mar-
keting at Duocash. "They're always 
the first," he said. "This industry 
has led the market in new tech-
nologies," 

There aren't many industries 
that can ca ll themselves recession-
proof, but pornography companies 
can make the argument more cred-
ibly than most. Overall, X-rated 
Web sites continue to grow, 
according to figures tallied by ana-
lysts at Jupiter Media Metrix. 

The number of individual visi-
tors at such sites grew more than 
27 percent from December 1999 to 
February this year - to nearly 28

If the outcome is that tht: util -

California's flawed deregulation

"[ ihink this could have an

in New York. "If the commissions

And the adult-content compa-
nies have profit mar.gins that their 
owners cheerfully acknowledge are 
obscene. Though not being too 
specific, Gerard Vanderleun, direc-
tor of the online site for Penthouse 
magazine, says that the Web si tes' 
profit margins "would be well 
above 50 percent and well below 
200 percent." 

Or, as Entertainment Network's 
founder, David Marshlack, put it. 
"It's almost like I owned a bank and 
was printing my own money." 

One reason the online fleshpots 
can weather recession iI; that "We 
don 't rely on advertising," said Bill

Second, indusJry experts say 
that any rate increases included in 
a reorganization plan would have 
to be approved by the' California 
Public Utilities Commission . 

"The tension then," Seife, the 
lawyer, said, "is, whose interest is 
paramount? The consumers or

JOne' Wins Complaint Against JUnity' 
Campaign posters called into question in A.5. Elections Board hearing 
Iy MARGARET O'NEILL 
Staff Writer 

The A.S. Elections Board of 
Inquiry ruled unanimously Friday 
that Jeff Dodge and the Unity slate 
were guilty of posting violations in 
their campaign fo r the 2001 A.S. 
Council election. 

Three members of the One 
slate filed formal complaints with 
the elections committee against 
the 22-member Unity slate for 
violating this year's posting poli-
cies. Unity was found guilty of 
posting signs over five feet in 
length and hanging banners on 
the Gilman Drive and Veterans 
Affairs Hospital bridges that were 
made of paper, rather than cloth 
as is mandated in A.S. bylaws. 

Against committee chair Vince 
Vasquez's recommendation, the 
One slate requested a formal 
hearing. The hearing was held at 
10:20 p.m. Thursday in the 
Student Leadership Chambers. 

The committee ruled that the 
Unity slate must write a formal 
apology to those filing the viola-
tinns and all other candidates 
affected by the violations. Also, as 
reparations for the extra publicity 
provided by the posting violations, 
the Unity slate was limited to 13 
posters in and on the Price Center 
from noon. Saturday to 11 :59 
p.m. Monday. This number 
includes slate and candidate post-
ings. 

The conditions surrounding 
the correction of the violation 
were in question at the hearing 
Thursday night. 

"Most of the problem I had 
was that the violations weren 't 

corrected in a timely manner; 
said One presidential candidate 
Ali Yazdi, one of the slate mem-
bers who filed a violation. 

"There was over a 30-hour 
period in which they could , have 
taken down the posters; said One 
vice president internal ca.,didate 
Shana Thakur. 

The Unity slate cited busy 
schedules, trouble locating proper 
supplies and difficulty mobilizing 
the 22 members as reasons for the 
delayed reaction. 

"It was just a delayed- time 
reaction, there was no malicious 
intent," said Dodge, Unity's presi-
dential candidate. 

The Unity slate admitted guilt at 
the hearing to the posting viola-
tions. Slate members had received 
an outdated copy of A.S. posting 
policies, which they blamed for their 
violations. Upon notification of the 
error, Dodge said he was not able to 
immediately attend to the posters. 

"When these violations were 
brought to my attention, it was 
8:30 a.m. on Monday, and I was in 
bed," Dodge said . 

He said he had classes all day 
that day, and he met with his slate 
that night to discuss the poster 
size problems 

The bridge posters were fIXed 
Monday afternoon. The Gilman 
Drive bridge signs were removed 
and the VA Hospital bridge sign 
was attached to cloth and tied up 
with string. 

The oversized posters in the 
Price Center were cut down 

. Tuesday by Vasquez. . 
"The average height of the ones 

I cut down was six feet or in excess 
of that," Vasquez said at the hearing. 

The One slate requested the 
hearing because of the publicity 
allotted to the Unity slate result-
ing from their oversized signs. 

Unity slate members admitted 
Thursday night that they erred in 
their delay to correct the viola-
tions. 

"Their argument rests solely 
on that there are 22 of us and we 
should have [taken down signs[ 
faster," said Unity slate member 
Nick Lieberknecht. "And we 
should have." 

Dodge agreed. 
"It is a violation, and it is a big 

deal," Dodge said. 
The Board's decision was well-

accepted by both slates. 
"I think it was an extremely fair 

ruling. We had offered to do this 
and more before the hearing," 
Dodge said. "Our slate and myself, 
we're extremely compliant in try-
ing to get this done." 

Thakur was surprised with the 
slate's cooperation in the matter. 

"I'm surprised that they decid-
ed to have some repercussions," 
Thakur said. "Since we could not 
decide in our informal meeting on 
adequate consequences, I'm 
happy with the decision." 

The Unity slate corrected the 
violating posters and continues to 
follow the current posting poli-
cies. 

"I think the elections board 
ruling was fair and it provides 
everyone with a chance to cam-
paign equally," Yazdi said. 

A.S. elections are being held 
today through Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 
p.m. Students can vote at

EATU 

A crash course in what you will be voting 
for this week in the A. S. elections 

W ith A.S. dcctions finally upon us, one can't help but wonder if it is going to be 
another year of apathy, or if this is final-
ly the y.:ar that UCSD students will 
come together and make their collec-
ti ve voice heard. 

Apathy l1<1s plagued UCSD from 
the trying times of the voting booth -
ask any Dade County residen t how 
hard that can be - to the current 
convenient method of computer vOt~ 
ing. 

One reason students might not be 
so eager to go out and vote is that they 
don'.t know what they are actua lly vot-
1I1g for. Sure, they see the fancy ti tles on 
the ba llots, but do the students really 
know what these people'~ responsibil i-
tiCS an: onc<, they get elected? It is 
doubtful. 

With that in mind , here is a Wish 
course In AS positions that should 
come in handy when co nsidering 
II'hol11 to vote for in this year's clec-

tion. 
President 

The school's top spot is not too dif-
ferent from our nation's president, if 
you really think about it. True, the A.S. 
president doesn't have a hoard of sexu-
ally frustrated interns to choose from, 
l'ut there are many similarities .. 

The A.s. president serves as the 
chief executive officer of the A.S. 
Council and is the official represen ta-
tive of the undergraduate body. He 
prepares and submits an annua l oper-
ating budget. The president also has 
veto power over any item passed by 
the A.S. Council. 
Vice Presidents 

Unlike the federal government, A.S. 
Council breaks the job of the vice pres-
ident into three separate jobs: the vice 
presidel1l internal, the vice president 
external i1nd the vice president finance. 

The vice president internal is the 
second in command in A.S. Council. 
He is the ac ting A.S. president in the 

president's absence. He runs the coun-
cil meetings, appoints student repre-
sentatives to campuswide committees 
~and also oversees the internal affairs of 
the A.S. Council, such as policies, pro-
cedures and administra tive council 
matters. 

The vice president external is in 
charge of lobbying for student issues 
on a state and national level. He is also 
in charge of organizing the campuswide 
voter registration campaign. In addi-
tion, the vice president external serves 
as UCSD's representative to both the 
University of California Student 
Association and the United States 
Student Association. 

Finally, the vice president finance 
is the loca l guru of everything bud-
getary at the school. He advises the 
president and the council on all bud-
getary matters and is in charge of 
enforcing all A.S. policies on expendi-
tures of the activity fee. The vice pres-
ident finance also assists the develop-

ment of all student organiza tion bud-
gets, organizes the quarterly Student 
Organization Funding Advisory Board 
and reviews expenditures of student 
activity funds. 
Commissioner of Student Advocacy 

The coml11issioner of student advo-
cacy, while not one of the more publi-
cized positions, is one of the most 
important in terms of direct involve-
ment with the students. 

This person informs, advises and 
represents students when co nflicts 
with the university arise. He also acts 
as the A.S. Council's liaison to the 
Office of Student Policies and Jud icial 
Affairs. 
Commluloner of Communication. 

Whoever takes this spot in the elec-
tion will be in charge of all the A.S.-

~unded student media on campus, 
lI1c1udll1g newspapers, magazines, tele-
vision and radio.

I don't know what it is, but there

something to do with the fact that 
summer is rapidly approaching. 
The thought of a three-month

that warm, fuzzy feeling inside.

A Pointless Rant About Various Things 
Going on Both at Home and Abroad 

for the past few days. So, here 
comes a series of mini-rants that 
will hopefully tide y'all over until I 
get really pissed off about some-
thing in the future. . 

First off, I have to say a few 
words about our president, Dubya. 
Wow, has he done a bang-up job as 
pres-o-dent so far, or what? I am 
truly impressed. Not only has he 
made up enough words to com-
prise a new dictionary, but he has 
also bombed Iraq and managed to 
anger the Chinese, the one real 
threat to America. 

All of that aside, I have a sug-
gestion for our new president. 
Dubya, for the love of all that is 
good and holy, please get some 
sleep! When Clinton displayed the 
luggage under his eyes, it was like, 
"I stayed up all night working hard 
for you, the American people." The 
bags under Dubya's eyes only tell 
me one thing: "I was up all night 
snortin' coke, drinkin' a 40 of O.E. 

. and makin' words up! " 
Along those lines, I wonder how 

Dubya feels about being the first 

president in history to have a 
Comedy Central sitcom dedicated 
to making fun of him. That must 
suck. 

I also have to say that my heart 
truly goes out to the American 
pilots in China right now. They are 
being used by the Chinese to test 
the waters-with our new president. 
They were just doing their job 
when Chinese aircraft were stupid 
enough to get in their way and take 
them down. They did everything 
they were supposed to except for 
torching the plane. I only hope that 
Bush can rise above his -third-grade 
reading level and negotiate the 
pilots' return quickly and smooth-
ly. 

On the home front, I am truly 
disturbed by the recent incidents of 
school violence. Maybe it's just me, 
but I cannot even fathom what was 
going through the minds of these 
kids as they strolled through the 
halls and shot at people. I'll grant 
them that kids can be cruel with 
the things that they say, but why 
shoot innocent people? What good 

does that do? 
Personally, I was glad to see the 

anitudes of some of the students 
from Granite Hills High School. 
Some who were interviewed did not 
say that they were sad and dis-
traught over the incident. Instead 
they lamented feelings of anger that 
someone would do something like 
that at their school. I think that it is 
about time that the students realize 
that this shouldn't be tolerated and 
keep each other in check. If they 
hear about the possibility of a 
shooting, they should react swiftly 
and harshly to discourage it, instead 
of egging the person on as was the 
case in the Santana shooting. 

The media should take the· 
alarming incidents of school vio-
lence that have been springing up 
with a dangerous frequency as a 
wake- up ca ll. If they continue to 
glamorize these events by stretch-
ing them out and repo'rting on 
every aspect of the shootings, then 
these kids will cont inue to get ideas 
to go on killing sprees. Do you 
rea lly think that it's necessary to 

interview one of the victim's fourth 
cousins? This is an exaggeration, 
but it's not far from the truth. I 
agree that the media has a respon-
sibility to report these things, but at 
the sa me time, they shouldn't 
glamorize it. Simply reporting the 
facts and moving on would suffice. 
If anything, they are just making 
things harder for the students who 
are trying to put the incidents 
behind them .

Jeff Dodg~e. ____ ~ 
After interviewing all of the 

A.S. presidential ca ndidates, the 
Guardian editorial board awards 
Its endorsement to Uni ty candi-
da te Jeff Dodge, based on his 
extensIve experience and prac tical 
ideas. 

Dodge, the curren t vice presi-
dent internal. has served on the 
A.S. Council since his freshman 
year. While A.S. experience does 
not automatica lly qualify a candi-
da te to become president, Dodge 
has distinguished himself as a 
councilll1ember that gets involved 
and gets things done. 

His experience on council is 
wide-rangll1g. He has served as a 
senator for two years and an exec-

Ali Yazdi~-~-
ne candidate Ali Yazdi is well-

qualified for the offi ce of presidcnt, 
but falls short of belllg as qualified 
as his opponent, Jeff Dodge. Yazdi, 
who unsuccessfully ran for presi-
dent last year, has sat on the A.S. 
Council for two years, most recently 
as Revelle senior senator. 

Yazdi 's ideas are unique and we 
agree with most of them. 

For example, Yazdi has pro-
posed climinating Club Ritmo and 
WinterFest in order to have a better 
FallFest and Sun God Festival, and 
10 possibly bring back the MTV 
Campus In va sion, which would 
bring another big name to campus. 
While we don't necessarily agree 
with the elimination of Club 
Ritmo, we agree that the $40,000 
WinterFest should be eliminated so 
that we have more money to spend 
on the other two festivals. 
Programming at UCSD needs a lot 
of help, and we believe that next 
year's council needs to do some-
thing significant, possibly drastic, 
to improve the situation. 

Yazdi also proposes saving 
money by eliminating AS. execu-
tive budgets, which provide council 
executives with extra money for 
miscellaneous business-related 
expenses. We applaud Yazdi for 
making such a proposal and we 
hope that if he is elected, he sticks 
to that plan, putting the good of 
the students in front of his own. 

utive member for one year. When 
he was a sophomore senator, the 
senate elected him as its chair. 

Dodge has sat on both the A.S. 
infernal and finance committees, 
the Chancellor's Budget 
Commillee, the University Centers 
Advisory Board and the Student 
Initiated Outreach and Retention 
Committee. 

Dodge said that if he is elected, 
he would do his best to promote a 
nimble and effective executive 
cabi net, which consists of the 
president and three vice presi-
dents. 

He stressed that it is absolutely 
necessary that the executive cabi-
net set the pace of the entire A.S. 
Council, and for that reason, he 
sees it as crucial that the executive 
cabinet be able to work together 
despite any personal or ideological 
differences. 

He said the key to keeping 
unity in a cabinet that could con-
sist of more than one slate is to 
identify and work toward common 
goals. 

Dodge noted that the A.S. 
Council under last year's President 
Tesh Khullar was very effective in 
this respect. It was a divided coun-
cil, but since it was so determined 
to fight for compromise, it was able 
to get things done, Dodge said. 

One of Dodge's main selling 
points is his strong advocacy for 
increasing support for student 

Yazdi has a plan to link Triton 
Taxi to other local colleges and 
universities. While we feel that' 
such a plan is impractical, we sup-
port a ge neral expansion of Triton 
Taxi co ncurring with Yadzi's 
intentions. 

The Guardian also has mixed 
thoughts on Yazdi's campus safety 
plan. While we support more call 
boxes on campus and security in 
parking lots, we find his plan to 
implement weekend shuttle service 
a waste of money. 

One idea that Yazdi and many of 
his slate members proposed was 
making the A.S. Council 
autonomous. While the Guardian 
will not yet take a position on such 
an issue, we believe it at least 
deserves to be looked into. Yazdi 
realizes that this is not something 
he can do in one year, but if elected, 
he promises to get the ball rolling 
by studying such a proposal. 

Yazdi said in his interview that 
rather than taking on the popular 
issues of parking and housing, he is 
focusing on more realistic issues 
such as campus safety and pro-
gramming. Yet in his candidate 
statement he promised increased 
student parking and solutions to 
housing problems. We question 
this anomoly, and hope that it is 
not an accurate representation of 
what otherwise seems to be an 
honest person. 

Yazdi has the ideas and the 
experience to effectively represent 
students, but in the end, we believe 

organizations. 
He proposes more than the typ-

ical increase in funding for student 
organizations championed by vir-
tually every candidate who wishes 
to have the slightest chance of vic-
tory. Dodge emphasizes the need 
for a physical presence in student 
organizations to help better under-
stand their needs and to offer the 
assistance of the A.S. Council 
whenever it is needed. 

Dodge maintains that it is not 
enough for A.S. Council members 
to help fund a student organiza-
tion's event, with the council's only 
presence being a little icon in the 
bottom corner of some flyers. He 
would insist that members of the 
council physically show up to the 
events that they sponsor, noting 
that it would contribute to the 
event's success as well as project a 
positive and pro-active image of 
the A.S. Council. 

Of course, Dodge also publicly 
supports expansion and increased 
funding for student organizations. 

His goals are to help facilitate 
the expansion of the Cross 
Cultural Center, the Lesbian Gay 
Bisexual and Transgender 
Resource Center, and the Women's 
Center. He also wishes to create a 
commuter and transfer student 
center. 

Obviously, doing these things 
will cost money. Well, Dodge even 
has an idea of where he'll get it. 

The Guardian also has 
mixed thoughts on Yazdi's 
campus safety plan. 
While we support more 
call boxes on campus and 
security in parking lots, 
we find his plan to 
implement weekend 
shuttle service a waste of 
money, 
that Dodge will do a better job. If 
Yazdi is elected, however, and holds 
true to many of his promises, he 
will make a positive mark on this 
campus. 

Muir junior Noah Levin mar-
kets himself as a visible member of 
the campus community and one 
who has met over 1,000 UCSD 
students. He says he loves UCSD 
and wants to make the campus a 
university that students can be 
proud of. 

Levin has experience on Muir 
College Council and identifies two 
big problems at UCSD as being 
programming and parking. 

Levin believes that the lack of 
UCSD pride could be solved by 
stronger programming. He propos-

Gazing into the 
horizon 

. According to Dodge, tens of 
thousands of dollars go unused by 
clubs and student organizations 
every year. This money comes 
back to the A.S. Council at the 
beginning of the next year and 
goes into a large unallocated 
monies fund that is not included 
in the annual budget. Dodge said 
that he is in favor of using all of 
that money to increase funding of 
student organizations. 

On the issue of increasing racial 
and cultural diversity at UCSD, 
Dodge has a plan that takes into 
account the fact that he will not be 
able to do everything himself. For 
this reason, he says he would create 
a commissioner of cultural affairs 
position with the specific purpose 
of promoting cultural diversity on 
campus. 

At a school known for its acad-
emics more than anything else, 
Dodge has some ideas to help stu-
dents to learn more and to have 
more flexibility. 

Specifically, Dodge is advocat-
ing a 24-hour library during finals 
week. He also said that he strongly 
supports the efforts of O.A.S.LS. 
and the Academic Success 
Program. 

Candidates who are new to the 
A.S. Council often make the point 
that spending too much time on 
the council can lead a person to 
become too much of a politician. 

While Dodge has been on 

es that there should be at least one 
social event per weekend, and a 
spirit night once per quarter. He 
plans on funding these events by 
working with sports teams and stu-
dent organizations, co-sponsoring 
the events with them. 

To alleviate parking problems, 
Levin said he will look into a stu-
dent-funded shuttle program to 
take them from local apartment 
complexes to campus. 

The program would be similar 
to the Hillcrest Medical Center 
shuttle program and would be 
cheaper and more convenient than 
parking on campus. While we 
doubt that such a program is prac-
tical, Levin said he would be open 
to any suggestion that others might 
have. 

We believe that Levin is on the 
right track in terms of identifying 
student problems. We think that he 
would do a good job improving our 
school spirit, but his scope is too 
narrow and his experience does not 
match up to that of Jeff Dodge or 
Ali Yazdi. 

Jennifer Christine Villanueva 
Ganata has good intentions but 
lacks the knowledge and experi-
ence to be an effective president. 

As a member of several Student 
Affirmative Action Coalition orga-
nizations, one of Ganata's main 
goals would be to increase diversity 
on campus and on the A.S. 
Council. While this is a concept 
supported by the Guardian, as well 
as by many students, Ganata does 
not have a specific plan to accom-
plish this goal. 

Ganata worked with the A.S. 
~ounci~ in last year's voter registra-
tion dnve. She also worked with 
the United States Student 
Associa tion and the Student 
Initiated Outreach and Retention 
Committee. 

Ganata eli eves that A.S.

active on campus and should not 
see themselves as being above 
anyone. She wants to make sure

council since fifth week of his 
freshman year and has always run 
with a slate, we have seen first~ 
hand that he is not bound by slate 
loyalties. 

As Vice President Internal, he 
has run council meetings in a fair 
and unbiased manner. Last year, 
when two members of his former 
slate, Students First, were caught in 
a scandal, he was not afraid to pub-
lically criticize them. 

Finally, when asked during an 
interview which A.S. president was 
most effective in the past three 
years, he named Joe Leventhal, a 
president who was often at odds 
with members of the slate Dodge 
was on at the time. He gave less 
cred it to current presiden t Doc 
Khaleghi, with whom Dodge ran 
on a slate last year. 

[n terms of experience, Dodge 
has the obvious upperhand. He has 
participated in such a broad spec-
trum of UCSD activities that he 
knows this campus and its students 
as well as anyone. He also knows 
the A.S. Council. He is easily the 
most veteran member of the coun-
cil running for a position. 

His platform is well-polished 
and it shows maturity, experience 
and forthought . With so much 
experience and such a solid and 
realistic platform, the Guardian 
cannot help but throw its weight 
behind Jeff Dodge for A.S. Council 
president. 

Greek students are represented, 
rather than marginalized, on this 
campus. 

If elected president, Ganata said 
she would like to increase funding 
for student organizations. Yet when 
asked where she would find the 
additional funds, she said she 
would look to the chancellor's and 
student affairs departments' bud-
gets. While it would be nice to have 
such a source for additional stu-
dent funds, student .organization 
money can come only from student 
activity fees, not from taxpayers or 
education fees. . -

An A.S. Council president 
needs to have a better knowledge 
of how the council works. For this 
reason, we do not endorse 
Ganata. 

John Bwarie is a highly energetic 
and enthusiastic student but is lim-
ited to A.S. experience on the col-
lege level. While he may be a good 
motivational spaker, he has no 
new ideas and no goals to imple-
ment. 

As president, Bwarie said he 
would listen to his fe llow council 
members and motivate them to 
implement their own itleas. He says 
that people currently view the 
office of president as something 
that it is not. 

We believe that the presidency 
is an office that should be filled by 
a strong and knowledgeable leader. 
While any A.S. president needs to 
be open to new ideas and willing to 
work with fellow council members, 
he must also have ideas, goals and 
plans of his own. 

Bwarie, an individual studies 
major in his third year, currently 
coordinates Preuss School admis-
sions and outreach. He designs and 
reviews applications, speaks at local 
schools and recruits UCSD stu-
dents to serve as volunteers and 
tutors at the Preuss School. Bwarie 
has also served as an apprentice 
eighth-grade teacher in Mira Mesa. 

While his resume is impressive, 
we do not believe that it qualifies 
him to be A.S. president.

Guardian endorses One candidate 
Shana Thakur. As the current sen-
ate chair, Thakur not only has A.S. 
Council experience but also has 
experience running meetings, 
which is one of the vice president 
internal's primary jobs. She current-
ly chairs meetings of 20 senators. 

We see Thakur as someone who 
will listen to student concerns and 
actively fight for these issues. She

tor for two years, but has also

Commission and in the A.S.

One of Thakur's main goals is 

to make A.$. council members work

also wants the council to interact 
more with student organizations 
and A.S. affi liates such as the Co-
ops, Volunteer Connection, the 
A.S. Internship Office and A.S.-
sponsored media. 

If elected, Thakur said she will

The Guardian enthusiastically 
endorses Sam Shooshtary, a mem-
ber of the Unity slate, and the sole 
candidate for vice president finance. 

To better serve AS funded Stll-

would send sma tors to dub meet-
ings, and have them submit regular 
reports to krep the AS CounCIl

of any difficult ies the organir.ations 
are experiencing. 

In particular, Shooshtary believes 
Student Affirmative Action 
Coalition organizations and the cul-
tural clubs on campus are under-
funded, and he would like to sec 
more funding go their way. 

Shooshtary takes issue wi th the 
fact that the Committee for World 
Democracy is givcn special treat-
ment when it comes to funding, 
something he finds illegal according 
to A.S. Council funding regulations.

In addition, we admire Thakur 

for taking the unpopUlar stance that 
the A.S. Council should stop hand-
ing out schedules of classes and 
blue books to students for free. 
While most students probably 
appreciate the giveaways, the $5,000 
can be better spent on funding 
events, especially since schedules of 
classes are available online.

The Guardian endorses Dylan 
Nicole de Kervor for the position 
of vice president external. De 
Kervor, who is running on the 
Unity slate, has experience in the 
office and currently serves as the 
national affai rs director for the 
A.S. external office. 

To the outside community, 
the vice president external is the 
most high-profile of the three 
vice presidents on the A.S" 
Council. The vice president 
external has the responsibility of 
being the students' liaison to San 
Diego and the community sur-
rounding UCSD, as well as to 
other universities. The vice pres-
ident external is also UCSD's 
chief representative to statewide 
and national student associa-
tions. 

In terms of her current posi-
tion within the A.S. Council, de 
Kervor is similar to her oppo-
nent, Ernesto Martinez, who is

Her goals are well-outlined and 
include fighting for diversity, cam-
pus safety and increased athletic 
support. 

[n the end, Thakur received our 
endorsement primarily because we 
believe she is the candidate more 
likely to stand up for students 
rights and interests rather than 
those of the admiistration. She has 
actively done so in the past, and we 
trust her to continue to do so in the 
future.

the A.S. externa l office. However, 
de Kervor seems to have been 
exceptionally active in a broad 
base of the external affairs 
office's agenda. 

As national affairs director for 
the past year, de Kervor has 
worked with both the University 
of California Student Association 
and the United States Student 
Association to coordinate lobby 
visits with state and local repre-
sentatives. 

De Kervor was UCSD's dele-
gation leader at the 2001 USSA 
Legislative Conference in 
Washington, was active in the 
coordination of the UCSA's 
Focus Attention on Retention 
campaign and served as chair of 
the logistics committee for the 
UCSA's 12th Annual Students of 
Color Conference.

which will mostly come from

and although 
both would excel 
at thiS position, 
Baclch has the 
edge. 

Both candi-
dates recognize 
that student 
media has been 
brgcly ignored at 
UCSD, and that 
work must be 
done to increase 
its funding and 
to increase ci rcu-
lation among 
stud ents. Both 
have good ideas

goals. Each can-

While both candidates are

can do a better job. 

For commissioner of academic 
affairs, the Guardian endorses One 
candida te Lance Feller. Feller 
boasts an impressive resume, 
which includes on-campus experi-
ence such as servi ng as a represen-
tative to the undergrad uate admis-
sions committee. 

He has far-reaching knowledge 
of UCSD admissions, and of the 
ca mpus in general. due to his 
extensive involvement. 

Feller has worked for the past 

Student

The commissioner of student 
advocacy is responsible for inform-
ing students of their rights and 
advising and representing students 
when conflicts arise between stu-
dents and the university. He also 
acts as the A.S Council's liaison to 
thc Office of Student Policies and 
Judicial Affiars. 

The two candidates for the pos-
tion are Kyle Biebcsheimer and 
Omid Sabet. Becasue one of the 
candidates is a writer for the 
Guardiall, we decided not to

it would present a conflict of inter-

two quarters with Commissioner of 
Academic Affairs Lana Krcdie and 
therefore knows the office well. 

While he said he approves of 
the job she did, he would be more 
strict in making appointments to 
committees and hold his 
appoin tees more accountable fo r 
their performance. 

Feller also understands the 
problem of campus overcrowding 
and said he will push for new lec-
tun: halls. He does not support the 
proposed lO-minute passing peri-
od because it will result in people 
arriving late to classes. As a tempo-
rary solution to overcrowding, he 
proposes extended class hours as 
the lesser of evils. 

Feller said that if elected, he 
will fight for guaranteed on-cam-
pus housing for all freshman, 
sophomore, transfer and interna-
tional students - something that 
will improve student life on this 
ca mpus. 

Feller's opponent, Unity candi-
date Jennifer DeCamp, does not 
have as much experience as Feller. 
She is proposing a dead day on 
Monday of finals week, something 
we cannot support because it will 
result in more students having 
exams on Saturday. 

Feller boasts an 
impressive resume, which 
includes on-campus 
experience such as 
serving as a 
representative to the 
undergraduate 
admissions committee. 

We therefore endorse Feller for 
commissioner of academic affairs 
based on his experience and 
knowledge of campus issues.

• • 'Gazing into the 

ommlSS oner horizon The UCSD Guardian Associated Students Election Guide 
Programming 

The- A.S. programmer is a posi-
tion in which each student should 
have a vested interest, as the impact 
of the A.S. programmer's work is 
felt directly on campus. With that 
in mind, the Guardian feels confi-
'dent that incumbent Assistant Co-
Programmer Eisha Christian will 
be able to make the transition to 
the next level as programmer and 
end the bad feelings between her 
office and the student body. 

Christian, running of the Unity 
slate, has worked in the program-
ming office for almost a full year 

and has expcrience working with 
bands, agents and the A.S. Council. 
She knows what is expected of her 
and how to accomplish what she 
needs to accomplish. Now it is only 
a matter of accomplishing the lofty 
goals she has set for herself. 

The Guardian likes Christian's 
idea of bringing in corporate spon-
sors for shows, as it would increase 
the money that could be offered to 
the bands. At a 5chool criticized for 
lack of entertainment on campus, 
this solution may be the best way 
to bring an end to this notion . 
Although the corporate sponsors 
wou ld advertise their names on 
campus, the Guardian considers 
this is a small price to pay for the 
change in dynamics that more 
money could bring to any festival 
or show UCSD holds. 

In addition, the GuardiOll likes 
how hristian plans to bring bigger 
names to the UCSD campus. By 
forming a partnership with other 
schools in the area, and booking a 
series of shows so the band plays at 
each school on consecutive days, a 
band would be more likely to 
accept an offer to come play at 
UCSD at a cheapcr fee, knowing 
that it is able to play many shows in 
a short time. 

By joining forces with area 
schools such as SDSU, we would 

Christian has worked in 
the programming office 
for almost a full year and 
has experience working 
with bands, agents and 
the A.5. Council. 
be able to allure bigger acts that 
would not normally play at this 
school. Because UCSD's program-
ming budget is already small, we 
need to stretch our dollar as much 
as possible.Thi s crea ti ve idea 
would allow for just that. 

The Guardian also thinks it is 
important to continue with "noon-
ers" on Wednesday afternoons, due 
to the high turnout for each of the 

shows this year. Christian plans to 
contin ue having these shows and 
expects to expand them III the 
future. 

Finally, Christian plans to con-
tinue with Club Rltmo next ycar: 
which could provide the extra 
social atmosphere that the school 
is looking for. By working with cor-
poratc sponsors, the quality of acts 
would improvc over ncxt year as 
bigger bands and DJs would agree 
to play. However, the club lost 
money this yea r under Christian, 
so we will wait to see if it can bc 
successful in its second full year of 
inccption . 

Similar to the se ntiments 
expressed by many students over 
Club Ritmo, the studen t body over 
the last few years has become 
increasingly frustrated over and 
angry with the quality of acts 
brought to campus. Though the 
problems may continue to persist 
in the short run, at least Christian 
has the knowledge and the ideas to 
rework the system so that UCSD's 
social life can. match its academic 
one. 

While her opponen ts, Mall 
Bechtel and Derek Baurmann, have 
good inten tions, they lack the 
experience and practical ideas that 
Christian has. We therefore 
endorse Christian for progran1mer. 

Services and Enterprises 
For the posItion of commis-

sioncr of services and enterprises, 
thc Guardian editorial board 
endorses Colin Parcnt. Parcnt dis-
tinguishes himself by his experi-
ences and the ideas he wishes to 
institute if elected. He currently 
serves as assistant to the present 
commissioner, Matt Conroy. This 
experience will be invaluable to 
him next year. 

One idea that Parent would 
like to implement is to make Soft 
Reserves a free service that all 
students could participate in . To 
supplement the cost of this 
action, he would like to advertise 
more vigorously for the rental of 
miniature refrigerators, another 
service that is coordinated by this

office. Parent says that it makes 
more sense to rent now because 
of the lack of a guarantee of on-
campus housing for second-year 
students. 

Parent also hopes to increase 
the boundaries of Triton Taxi to 
the border. To help stimulate 
demand for such a service, he 

hopes to institute a sign-up 
process that . would be done 
through resident advisors. 

One more action that Parent 
wishes to take is to increase fund-
ing to the Academic Success 
Program and O.A.S.l.S., a worthy 
goal but something that he may 
have trouble finding funding for. 

Parent distinguishes himself 
from his opponent, Joseph 
Sherman-Villafane, primarily 
because of his experience with the 
job. He simply has a better grasp of 
what it takes to run the office. 
Sherman-Villafane has similar 
ideas but less of an understanding 
of how to implemcnt them, and for 
this reason the Guardiall editorial 
board is endorsing Parent.

14 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

Fee Referendum 1 - No 
Fcc Rcfermd um Ques tion 1 

seeKS to increase th e A.S. 
Activities Fec by $2 per quarter 
for t'ach UCSD student to pay fo r 
membership in the United Statcs 
Stude nt Associa tion and the 
Ul1Ivcrsity of California Student 
ASSOCiation. 

The Guardian editorial board 
does not endorse this increase in 
fees and strongly urges students 
to vo tc against it. This referen -
du m basica lly provides A.S. mem-
bers and future candidates better 
resou rces in terms of money, 
meetin gs and conferences to help . 
fu nd their campaigns and trips to 
statew ide and national confer-
ences. 

The disbursement of fees 
would break down as follows : 19 
ce nts (approximately 10 percent) 
would stay on campus to help 
fund A.S. cam paigns, 91 cen ts 
(approximately 45 percent) would 
go to membership fees to join the 
USSA and 90 cents (approximate-
ly 45 percent) wou ld go to UCS D 
membership in UCSA. While th is 

amount seems quite small , sum-
ming them together would wo uld

see a problem with jo ining 
UCS A, which is, as its name 
implies, associated w.ith the UC 
system, there are a couple of rea-
sons why the Guardian d<?es not 
support this fee referendum. 

T he first is that it requires 
membership into the USSA, an 

outside organization and a lobby-
ing group not affiliated with the 
UC system. UCLA had passed a 
refe rendum similar to this, and 
the chancellor also signed it , but 
was struck down by the UC 
Rege nts for exactly the same rea-
son. 

T he UCSA lobbies to state and 
local representatives on issues 
that directly affect the UC system. 
On the other hand, the USSA 
lobbies the federal government, 
and does not have the University 
of Cali fornia's interests specifical-
ly in mind . 

It is unfortunate and unwise 
that the sponsors of this referen-
dum chose to include member-
ship to both the USSA and UCSA 
in the same referendum. 

The Guardian would whole-
heartedly endorse a small fee 
increase to pay for membership in 
the UCSA, but the fact that this 
membership was linked to the 
USSA membership prevents us 
from supporting Fee Referendum

Amendment 1 - No 
Constitutional Amendment 1 

seeks to clari fy th e classifica tion of 
A.S. senate candidates as fresh-
man, sophomore, junior or senior. 
The logic behind this amendment 
is that with the increase of stu-
dents entering with many AP units 
and an increase in transfer stu-
dents,. it is difficult to determine 
who can run for which senate 
positions 

This amendment would 
address the ambiguity by taking 
the decision out of the A.S. 
Council's hands and leaving the 
decision up to the individual col-

leges to formulate their own elec-
tion regulation s. It also seeks to 
give the colleges more autonomy 
as to who it can allow to be a sen-
ator for each class level. 

The Guardian does not support 
this amendment. We believe it 
would subvert the interests of stu-
dents and create m.ore problems. 

With individual colleges able to 
create their own by-laws in choos-
ing their senators, colleges with 
more lax requirements would be 
abl to attract prospective student 
leaders to them, dtpriving the 
other colleges of this leadership. 

Amendment 2 - Yes 
Due ' to widespread apathy on 

this campus, the Guardian endorses 
Constitutional Referendum 
Question 2. The referendum 
makes it easier for the A.S Council 
to amend its constitution, ' some-
thing counci lmembers have 
unsuccessfully tried to do for the 
past several years. 

The question eliminates a 
requirement that the council pro-
duce a petition signed by 15 per-
cent of the student body. 

While we support the system of 
democracy and feel the students 
should have a voice, student apa-
thy has in the past made it difficult 
for the council to amend its con-
stitution . 

Currently there are two ways to 
bring a referendum to vote. The 
first is a direct referendum in which 
15 percent of the student body is 
required to place an issue onto the

ballot for a vote or it can be voted 
on by the A.S. Council, requiring 
two-thirds majority for passage. 
Once it goes to the ballot, it then 
requires a majority vote of the stu- . 
dents at UCSD. 

A second way bypasses the ballot 
but requires much more effort. This 
second way, which is affected by this 
amendment, requires three-fourths 
of the A.S. Council, three-fifths of 
the colleges and 15 percent of 
UCSD students to sign a petition. 
This amendment would discard the 
petition requirement. 

When council members 'have 
solicited student signatures in the 
past, they have done so on Library 
Walk and have offered free blue 
books. They are present to answer 
questions, but most students do 
not take the time to understand 
what they are signing, they only 
sign and take their bluebook. This

Th is may then force colleges to 
'compete for student leaders, relax-
ing their by- laws too. Th is co uld, 
in turn , cause an imbalance in the 
quality of leadership at the fi ve 
colleges, which would direct ly 
affect quality of student life. 

Secondly, and more generally, 
the student councils at the col-
leges are less experienced than the 
A.S. Council in writing these by-
laws. 

For these reasons, the Guardian 
does not endorse this amendment 
and urges students to vote against 
it. 

process is meaningless and should 
be bypassed. 

Another aspect this amendment 
touches on is the required three-
fifths of the colleges to vote. 
Currently there is no requirement 
to approach all the colleges with a 
referendum. For example, Tesh 
Khullar, the A.S. President last year, 
approached only the required 
numbers of colleges, completely 
leaving the others out of the loop. 
This amendment, beyond merely 
removing the 15 percent require-
ment, would require that all col-
leges need to be approached with a 
referendum. 

The A.S. Council constitution 
only affects students indirectly, but it 
affects the council directly. 
Amendments are usually made to 
make the council run more efficient-
ly. Therefore we believe the counci l 
should make those decisions.

Continued from page 11 

Dc Ken'or's view of the ex ter-
Ilill affairs office as much more 
than a platfo rm for outreach to 
underreprcscllted students is cer-
tainly a prudl'll t one. 

As Illustrated by her ac ti vity 
with the Focus Attent io n on 
Rctcntl oll GlInpalgn and her work 
I'LlI' the Studcnts of Co lor 
COI)fc rencc, she IS grea tly con-
cnncd with Ihe lack of diversity at 
UCS 0 , and III the UC system in 
genc ral. 

She has other goa ls for the 
office, such as improving and 
IIlcreasi ng the sca ll' of the exte r-
11a l office's vo ter registration 
drive, which she believes could be 
much more organized and effec-
tive than It was last year. 

If elected, she also plans to 
improve relations between the 
external oftice and student-run 
busi nesses such as Groundwork 
Books, the Co-op, the General 
Store and the Che Cafe. 

De Kervor pl ans to increase 
student illvolve ment and aware-
Ill'SS by tcaming LIp with the A.S. 

As illustrated by her 
activity with the Focus

campaign and her work 
for the Students of Color 
Conference, she is 
greatly concerned with

events to issues that the A.S. 
external affairs office is facing. 
She said she believes this will help 
inform more students of how they 
can get involved with the council. 

Both candidates have reason-
able proposals for and relevant 
experience with the lack of diver-
sity at UCSD. 

Martinez and de Kervor say 
they want to increase and expand 
outreach and retention programs. 

Specifically, de Kervor would 
seek to collaborate with the A.S. 
internal office on the A.S. 
Outreach Program. She also 
would focus high school outreach 
visits to those schools that alrl'ady 
have Uplift and GEA R UP pro-
grams. 

De Kervor would continue to 
lobby the state legislature to 
increase budget allotmen ts for 
retention programs. She also said 
she would fight to increase fund-
ing to existing retention programs 
such as O.A.S.l.S., A.S. Lecture 
Notes and the Academic Success 
Program. 

With her extensive experience 
and high level of activity in her 
current position, it is the opinion 
of the Guardian that de Kervor is a 
high-quality candidate and the 
best choice for the next A.S. vice 
president external. 

In making our candidate enaorsements, the Guardian editorial board inter-
viewed each A.S. Council candidate and then deliberated on who would 
be best for each position . For the referendums, the board researched the 

. referendums by speaking to current A.S. Councilmembers.

Examining the Generation 
Gap in Asian Families 

BookReview A humorous and dark look at the subject 
By TOM VU 
Senior St aft Writ er 

We often hear people refer to 
the ge neration gap when dis-
cussing the rift between parents 
and their children . The generation 
gap is a source of division and awk-
wardness between the child and 
parent, ranging from music to 
slang terms to social cultures. 
When looking at Asian-American 
families, however, the generation 
gap is even wider. Exacerbated by 
the very conservati vt> and tradition-
al values parents ad here to (and 
expect their children to abide), set 
against the more liberal American 
culture the children have taken to 
heart, the gap sometimes pi ts one 
agaTnst the other in a way only 
ASian families can understand. 

Christina Chiu's first book, 
"Trouble Makers and Other 
Saints," examlll~S, in both humor-
ous and dark ways, the generation 
gap in three fictio nal Chinese fam-
ilies: the Wongs, Shengs and Tungs. 
Chiu is an up-and-coming writer 
who has a mastds of fine arts from 
Columbia University. She is also 
one of the origTna l founders of the 
Asian-Amencan Writers 
Workshop. "Trouble Makers and 
Other Saints" has undeniably pro-
pelled her into the forefront of 
Asian-American literature scene. 

A collection of 11 short stories, 
"Trouble Makers and Other 
Saints" gives a refreshing and often 
very stark look at what tears these 
families apan - the inability of the 
parents to adapt to their children 
and the childr~n's unwi llingness to 
give Tn, even a little, to their par-
ent's desires. Th~ stories, though all 
fictional, are very accurate in their 
examTnation of Ch inese culture 
and families. They touch on the 
high expectations parents have of 
children getting in to a well-known 

university, how parents like to 
co mpete with other parents by 
showing off their child's accom-
plishments and the more subtle 
relationships within the family. 

Chiu masterfully weaves a 
macabre web, intricately connect-
ing the three families and the 11 
stories. While each story can stand 
alone, it connects with one other 
through events and characters, and 
span 10 years from beginning to 
end. In the first story we read of 
Laurel, whose grandmother has 
recen tly passed away. By the end of 
the story, Laurel has decided to kill 
herself through starvation. It leads 
into the second story, which is 
about a successful doctor, 
Georgianna Wong, who looks after 
Laure! while she is in the hospital 
for anorexia. Georgianna, on the 
other hand, is al ienated from 'her 
parents for marrying a black man . 

The issues that Chiu touches 
on arc very real and inflammatory 
in the Asian-American household 
- issues that most Asian families 
prefer to ignore and brush beneath 
the metaphorical couch, hiding 
them and hoping they will simply 
go away. Some stories delve into 
the dark world of suicide while 
others examine interracial mar-
riage. Others involve the issue of 
sexual orientation: a bisexual 
daughter and a gay son. 

One of the most poignant sto-
ries is titled "Matriarch." It deals 
with Georgianna's grandmother, 
Peony, who communicates with 
her dead husband and envisions a 
dark future for her younger grand-
daughter, Rachel, who will have an 
abortiori. The grisly description of 
Peony's vision of the aborted fetus 
is reminiscent of Cassandra's 
prophetic ravings in Aeschylus' 
"The Oresteia; filling our minds 
with a sense of hopelessness, 
depravity and confusion. 

Chiu utilizes strong language in 
her storytelling. Poignant, fra nk 
and even offensive to some as she 
hits the truth, hers is an "unflinch-
ing voice" as Hal Sirowirz, author 
of "Mother Said," referred to it. 
Not everything in life ends with a 
smile. People hide the truth from 
one another, even in extreme situa-
tions. They hide it from their 
friends, their famili es and even 
themselves. Though the stories 
revolve around three Chinese-
American families, the issues Chiu 
openly touches on are taboo in; all 
Asian families. 

Ultimately, we must ask, who 
are the troublemakers and who are 
the saints? While I would give away 
the most important aspect of the 
enti re novel by answering this 
question, a reader can come to his 
own conclusions and still be cor-
rect. Each story focuses on a char-
acter that faces a fork in his life -
to stay on the same course or to 
change. 

As we read "Trouble Makers 
and Other Saints," we are put 
through a catharsis as the charac-
ters discover themselves. In the 
end, some do not change while 
others do and, as the title-suggests, 
find redemption. In turn, we, the 
readers, are also redeemed by their 
trials by fire. As the famous Asian-
American author Mei Ng rraised, 
"These compelling tales 0 loneli-
ness and loss, hunger and need, the 
pain and crazy love for family will 
break your heart, and strangely. 
leave you feeling uplifted." 

"Trouble Makers and Other 
Saints" is an intricately written 
·novel, filled with frankness and 
honesty, but not anger and spite. 
With abundant metaphors, this 
novel is perfect for the student 
majoring in literature. But more

" Your IIIrtIIcIIIy Is tills WMIc 
Expect romance to become pro-

gressively more complicated in the 
coming weeks and months. Many 
Aries natives wi ll now experience 
rapid ly increasing social and 
romantic options. Much of this 
newfound passion ends almost a 
17-month period of lost ambi tion 
in key relationships or social disin-
terest. Let new emotional commit-
ments and rekindled attractions 
develop at their own pace. After 
mid-June, business roles may also 
dramatically change: Travel, distant 
job opportunities and revised 
employment duties will be an ongo-
ing theme throughout the summer 
months. A busy and emotionally 
rewarding year, Aries. Enjoy!

Taboo topics for Asian-

sexuality, mental disorders, suicide, 
the troubles of "mixed" families 
and interracial ' marriages. She 
walks a fine line between despair 

and cynicism, anger and loss, yet by 
the end her skills bring us into

I would also highly recommend 
this novel to any who are interest-

Baseball Loses Two 
to Cal State LA 
Tritons have tough time on road, 
losi ng 9-4, 5-0 over the weekend 
By ANDREW QUADRI 
Staff Writer 

Rain wiped out what was to be 
the second half of a four-game 
series, Saturday's UCSD-Cal 
State Los Angeles doubleheader, 
and maybe it was just as well. The 
Tritons lost the first half of the 
series at Reeder Field in Los 
Angeles. 

The Tritons dropped Friday's 
first game 9-4. The Golden 
Eagles ' Chris Johnson pitched 
seven innings and got the win to 
bring his record to 5-1 for the 
year. 

UCSD staning pitcher John 
Beaven struck out six batters and 
walked four. Beaven gave up all 
nine runs, only two earned, and 
took the loss. His record this year 
is now 3-6. 

After two Innings the Tritons 
were aln:adl down 7-1. The Tri-
IOns made SIX errors, four of them 
In the tirst t\\\ IIl nlngs. Shonstop 
Tyler Sullival dnd first baseman 
Eric Thorpe l'ach made two 
errors. Sull ll' ln now has 28 errors 
this yea r. 

Rat' Bl'r~'1 l' m relieved Beav-
en III the \l cnth and pitched 
two perfect 'I Il lllgS, striking out 
the Side ill e boltom of the 
eighth . 

The Tntl" fa red only slightly 
better at thl' late. Sullivan and 
second basl'l n Anthony Loco-
co each went fo r-4 and drove in 
a run. Thorp walked twice. He 
leads the teal" with 17 walks this 
year. 

All of the Tritons' eight hits 
were singles. The Tritons left 11 
runners on base. 

Third baseman Chad Addi-
son, who is notoriously hard to 
strike out, fanned once. It was 
his sixth time in 126 at-bats this 
year. 

The Tritons were shut out 5-0 
in the second game on Saturday. 
Cal State LA's Dave Peters threw 
his second straight complete 
game shutout, giving up seven 
hits and striking out four. 

UCSD's Andy Hanau gave up 
five runs, twO of them earned, 
and nine hits in seven innings. 
The loss dropped his record to 
2-6. 

The Tritons had more troubles 
in the field as shortstop Ian Nagy 
made two errors in the second 
inning. 

Cal State LA again led early 
and was ahead 4-0 at the end of 
the second. The Golden Eagles' 
shortstop Rashawn Owe ns 
homered to right field to lead off 
the sixth inni ng. Owens was 2-
for-2 with one home run , one 
RBI, two walks and two runs 
scored. 

The Tritons ' designated hitter, 
Ryan Larson, went 2-for-3 and 
walked once. Larson has six hits 
in his laSt three games and leads 
the team with a .419 batting aver-
age. 

UCSD is now 10-23 overall 
and 5-1 8 in CCM play. 

The two rained-out games will 
be rescheduled and played later in 
the season.

Track Com'petes in 
Meet at POint Lorna 

Column: 
Today, there is no reason 
for artificial turf 

UCSD does not send a large 
squad, but shows well on the field 

ContInued from ..-ge 24 
stadiums in the Northeast used to 
opt for the fake junk. Let's see, here 
in San Diego, the weather is never 
too cold, never too hot. There is no 
need for artificial turf. By ROBERT FULTON 

Sports Editor 

The UCSD track and field 
team competed with a number of 
other schools at Point Lorna 
Nazarene University on Saturday. 

[n addition to UCSD and the 
host school. California State Uni-
versity San Marcos, Azusa Pacific 
University and the University of 
San Diego were present. 

The Tritons did not field a full 
squad on either the men's or 
women's side. 

The Triton women had a num-
ber of top competitors in the field 
competition. Tina Summers took 
second in the hammer throw with 
a distance of 46.74 meters. Megan 
Bergin was right behind her with a 
toss of 42.68 for third. 

The UCSD women were also 
deadly with the pole vault as Kelly

"It's looking good for us; our 
coach, Tony Ontiveros, is talking 
with the rec club," Gottschalk 
said. "As long as we can set up 
some matches for next year, we're 
going to make the transition." 

For Gottschalk, a senior, there 
is on Iy one regret for the past 
season. 

"[ would really like to have 

Mimnaugh, Juliana Mittino and 
Jackie Vu took the top three 
spots, respectively. 

Jen Rubin took first in the 
triple jump for the Triton women 
and Sarah Raoufi took second in 
the high jump with a le.ap of 4 
feet, 10 inches. 

The men had a few good per-
formances on the field. 

Rob Ewanio took second in 
the hammer throw with a dis-
tance of 49.30. Yogi Defor came 
in third with a throw of 45 .28. 

In the pole vault, Tritons Steve 
Pease and Mark Gomez took the 
top two spots. 

The long jump also saw a stel-
larTriton performance as Kennon 
Kwok finished second. 

Next up for UCSD is a meet at 
home on Saturday, when it will 
host the UCS D Collegiate Invita-
tional at 11 a.m. 

been an All-American; he said . 
"I'm probably going to be work-
ing at a lab and take a class in the 
fall and keep wrestling." 

Whatever happens, he is sure 
to keep in touch with the friends 
he has made through wrestling. 

"The guys have gotten to be 
real tight: Gottschalk said. "It 's a 
great feeling. I'm definitely going 
to keep in touch, stay a pan of the 
team ." 

With everyone returning next 
year, there's no doubt that UCSD 
wrestling is a submission hold 
away from the national champi-
onship. 

Astroturf is well-suited for 
domed stadiums. See. back when the 
Houston Astrodome first opened, it 
was the first of its kind. They made 
the ceiling transparent: The glare 
from the glass made it difficult to 
catch fly balls, so they painted over it. 
That caused the grass to die and 
Astroturf was invented. [don't know 
of any domed stadiums around here, 
unless someone is thi[lking of con-
verting RlMAC Arena into an Arena 
Football League ven·ue. 

Additionally, grass technology 
has increased by leaps and bounds. 
There is grass that can last a long 
time withouf much water or sunlight 
- perfect for many of today's domed 
stadiums. [t is a hardier grass that is 
able to weather the elements. Many 
professional baseball and football 
stadiums are phasing out the fake 
stuff, with only a few venues left now 
with the fake grass. So, with perfect 
weather, no domed stadiums and 
new grass technologies, there is no 
reason for UCSD to have anificial 
turf anywhere on campus. 

You would think that at a cam-
pus such as ours, with so much 
intelligence, ideas such as anificial 
turf would be laughed at. Astroturf is 
awfu l on the body. The knees, 
ankles, legs, back - they all suffer 
from the impact of foot on n1bber 
plastic pavement. Players' careers 
have been cut shon because of this 
stuff. Joints get worn down and 
whacked out of place. It is bad news. 

Fake plastic grass? Please. Hun-
gry Moses probably gets heartburn 
thinking about it.

The UCSD team is funded par-

The star of the competition for 
UCSp was Kyle Kleinschmidt, who 
went 3-3 in the 174-pound weight 
class to finish in the top six and 
earn All -American honors. He is 
the first All-American wrestler in 
the history of UCSD. 

"Kyle has a real good chance Ito 
be a national championl, if not next 
year, then the year after since he's 
only a freshman," Gottschalk said. 

Gottschalk himself had the sec-
ond best performance for UCSD, 
going 2-2 and making it to the top 
eight before being eliminated in the 
quanerfinals. 

Nathan Uchida, competing in 
the 133-pound division, went 10 
the fifth roltnd of the consolation 
bracket before being eliminated,

Water Polo Tosses Pomona 
Triton women put the hurt on Division III Sagehens, win 17-5 at home 
By SCOTT BURROUGHS 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD women 's water polo team suit-
ed up in its finest Speedo-endorsed att ire and 
hit Canyonview Pool on Saturday to square 
off agai nst Pomona-Pitzer College in a hard-
fought battle to the death . Well , not quite to 
the death, but the heated action and Triton 
attack led the onlookers to believe tha t lives 
could be in danger. In the end, Pomona 
Pltzer's record was the only thing to take a 
beating, as the UCSD II/omen swam away 
with a 17-5 victOry. 

It was a big day for Dana TLicker and Emma 
Kudritzki, each scoring four goals in the Sage-
hen stomping. Courtney Hemmerly was also 
impressive. tallying a hat trick , whi le Danielle 
Boyle and Erin Welsh each had a pair. Megan 
Hubbs was solid in the cage, making f?Llr saves 
in three quarters. Andrea Corn ford relieved 
Hubbs in the fourth and closed out the victo-
ry, making one save in the process. 

Sagehen Jacquie Cole notched three goals 
and goalie Claire Townsend knocked down 
nine saves in the loss, which caused the team 's 
record t drop to 3-6. 

With the win, the Tri tons improved their 
record to 12- 10 on the season and are current-
ly ranked 11 th in the Collegiate Water Polo 
poll.

Volleyball Can't Catch a Break, Lose Two More 
Tritons can't match up at home against juggernauts UCLA, Irvine this weekend 
By SCOTT BURROUGHS

The UCSD mcn's volleyball 
team clashed with a pair of titans 
(wer the weekend, taking some 
serious lumps from two of Califor-
nia's tOp collegiate powers. 

The team went to battle with 
UC Irvine on Friday night at the 
Macky, where it gave a valiant 
effort but did not have the fire-
pow.cr to overcome the Anteater 
attack . The scoreboard reflected 
this. its bright lights glowing with 
30-15, 30-26, 30-24 scores in 
Irvllle's advantage. 

The ~lIrborne sweep started as 
soon as the Ilrst spike found hard 
wood. as the Anteaters madc their 
prescnce fdt by domlllating the 
Ilrst set and then gilding through 

th~ next two to pick up the victo-
ry. The TritOns opened up neck 
dnd neck with UCI, until. with the 
score knotted at fOLlr, the 
Anteaters went (1 n a 14-2 run and 
m:vcr looked back. 

Senior Donald Chen had an 
impressive yet sporadic game fo r 
the Tritons, leading the team with 
10 kills but commi.tt ing eight 
errors. Team mate and fellow 
fou rth-year player Zach Hite also 
did his part, knocking down nine 
kills and adding fi ve digs. Jordan 
Hove was the dish master once 
agai n fo r UCS D, passing out 34 
assists. 

Erick Helenihi had an awe-
some game fo r UCI , beating the 
TritOns down wi th a whopping 18 
ki ll s. Fellow Anteaters Jimmy 
Pelzel and Brenden Wata mull also 
mad~ ~heir presence felt, with nine 
and eight kills apiece. Todd Stein-
ert was the man behind the men, 
kicking down 38 assis ts in the vic-
tOry. 

By sweeping UCS D, the 
Anteaters improve thei r record to 
6-9 fo r the season. 

The next night posed an even

greater challenge for our beloved 
Triton volleyball squad. It faced 
UCLA, a perennial powerhouse in 
the collegiate ranks, which was rid-
ing high on the horse with a 10-4 
record for the season. The Tritons 
were not impressed, though, and 
opened the evening up with a rous-
ing 30-26 first set victory in front of 
a 513-person crowd. 

The set win got the party start-
ed at RIMAC Arena, as many 

began to smell an upset. But what 
many thought was upset aroma 
turned out to just be unwashed 
sweat socks, as the Bruins roared 
back to take the next three sets. 
30-26, 30-22 and 30-18 to silence 
the raucous Triton fans and to seal 
up their 11 th victory. 

Once again , Chen was the 
main man on the UCSD attack, 
smashing a stellar 19 kills and 
logging six digs in the effort. Hite 

was also a force , with 12 kills and 
five digs, while fellow Tritons 
Griffin Cogorno, a solid 12 kills 
and team leading 10 digs, and 
Eric Perrine, seven digs also had 
highly respectable outings. Hove 
did his thing, compiling a mas-
sive 55 assists in the vali ant 
effort .
