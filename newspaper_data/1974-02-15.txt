Sem inar To Be Held on Dorm 
Privacy Problems 

by Roberta Rehm 
Would you rather be busted by the campus police or 

your resident dean? 
A seminar on the 27th of February will attempt to 

present the pros and cons of each option . Raphael 
Levens, an attorney in the Office of Student Affairs , will 
present the legal aspects of dorm privacy and a bust by 
the resident deans versus a bust by the campus police. 

Within the next two weeks all resident students will 
receive a position paper, stating the legal pros and cons 
and a questionnaire . The questionnaire will attempt to 
determine the preference of students in the matter and 
the results will be presented to the advisory committee 
on dorm contracts for consideration before approval of 
next year 's dorm contract. 

The 8-11 pm seminar, which will be held in the Muir 
Five and Dime is being organized by a comm ittee of 
resident students and others interested in the legality of 
the present resident halls contract . 

"Students may not want the resident deans carrying 
out the powers of the police," Levens said . If this is the 
case, the committee will attempt to have the residence 
halls contract changed to reflect this sentiment. Levens 
stressed that there are pros and cons on both sides of 
the question, however, and that the deCision has " got to 
come from students and residence halls people ." 

Right now, Levens said, the resident deans are acting 
as private citizens with the right of any landlord, upon 
entering a room and as such , are not· obi igated to 
conform to search and seizure laws . The campus police, 
on the other hand, are law officers and must follow 
these rules . 

Although the police must obtain a search warrant , 
unless there is immediate "probable cause" (such as the 
smell of dope in the halls); they also have the legal 
power to arrest a student and to prosecute a case 
Levens stated that the resident deans are more ' ~i~ely , to 
handle the problem within the school and less Illtely .to 
prosecute thE' case . 

Crafts Center 
Facing FundinR Problems 

The appearance of marijuana plants in many dorm 
windows and recent threats by Muir Resident Dean Cleo 
Malone, that he will be strictly enforcing drug laws in 
Muir residence Halls lead several students, who con-
sequently contacted Levens, to question the legality of 
the co ntract and the privacy rights of resident students . 

Next year 's residence halls contract has already been 
drawn up but final approval by George Murphy, Vi ce 
Chancellor for Student AffairS, and the contrac t ad-
visory committee is being held up pending the outcomE' 
of the Questionnaire and seminar 

Crafts Center Facing 
Critical Problems 

Levens stated, on Wednesday, during a meeting of 
the comm ittee, that ac'cordin g to the contract, a 
resident dean may enter a student's room if he has 
reasonable cause to believe something illegal is going 
on inside. He continued, however, that according to the 
most recent decisions in federal courts, rooms may be 

ntered only in the furtheran ce of an educational 
purpose. 

The committee working on the seminar and 
questionnaire includes Tom Lean se, Co cha irper on of 
the Student Fee Committee, representatives of PAGE

The myth that "anything 
to do with ceramics is just 
good therapy for students" 
has been physically 
disproven by the present 
success of the Arts and 
Crafts center at UCSD . 
There are now over 365 
students attending classes 
at the center, and at least 
150 more students unable 
to attend classes due to the 
fac t that the center's 
bu ilding is already 
cru mbling beneath the 
weight of student interest. 

The center was originally 
designed to be a commuter 
lounge and small scale arts 
and crafts, photography , 
ce ramics, jewelry al'\d 
enamel ing workshop "get 
away". The building was 
not constructed to meet the 
present flooding demand of 
since re students interested 
in ceramics , not to mention 
jewelry , enameling, and 
photography . The floors are 
Visib ly sagging due to 
overuse. Three gas kilns are 
standing unused in the 
backyard of the center 
awaiting the replacement of 
the wooden beam supports 
in one area of the building's 
ceiling by steel supports so 
that the kiln can be 
operated accord in g to 
environmental and hazard 
board regulations . 
Photographic materials in 
the center are being 
destroyed by heavy dust 
filtering into the darkroom 
trom the Student Center's 
construction site. 

These problems represent 
only a part of the im-
mediate crises which is 
effecting the basic func-
tioning capabilities of the 
center . 

John Anoloro, Director of 
t he Arts and Crafts Center 
Vivid ly outlined in a rec nt 
InterVIE'W , the tenuou 

balance on which the 
ce nter is operating . 
Economically, the center's 
si tuation parallels that of 
most student activities at 
UCSD, namely, insufficient 
capital. A long with the 
success of the center has 
come a sizable budget for 
basi c operation . Not being 
an accred ited department , 
the center is unable to 
receive any state funds. The 
fifteen dollars from student 
fees, complimented by 
monies from Reg . Fee, have 
up to now been the center's 
sole sources of funding . 
These monies, although 
representing a substantial 
amount in comparison to 
other student activities are 
and will continue to be 
insufficient in keeping the 
center above the red line on 
the books . 

What follows this 
predicament is an in -
tertwining , inter-related set 
of problems which involve 
not only economic ten-
sions, but also tensions 
evolving from the center's 
obvious need for larger 
space . 

One of the most major 
concerns facing the center 
is the present situation with 
the "backyard kilns". Many 
students are having to wait 
months to fire their 
ceramics as there is but one 
kiln available for firing . The 
additional kilns would not 
only disperse the growing 
collection of unfired 
ceram ics at the center, but 
would allow beginning 
students the ability to see 
the process of ceramic in 
its consecutive entirity 

" The situation" can be 
remedied when the wood 
beam are repla ed by st I

Government Lawyers? 
President Nixon' is 'seekin'g appropriations to pay 30

A request for funds for 30 uns'pe~1fied White House 
jobs was contained in the fine print of the feae~al 
budget Nixon sent to Congress. last week .' .' 

A White House spok~s~'an ' said ' in response to 
questions that 30 positions would be "used if necessary 
for professional and supportin~.p~rso~~el !n~h~ Whit;

-American Achievement 
' In commemoration of the 48th annual celebration of 
Afro-American History Week, February 10 through 16, 
the San Diego Human Relations Commission has set up 
a display of literature which features biographical 
sketches of Black women and men who have achieved 
fame in politics, science, business, athletics, and the 
arts. The display may be seen at the HRC office, 3730 
Fifth Avenue, San Diego. 

The Week's founding organization, the Association 
for the Study of Afro·American life and History, 
Initiated the event in 1926 to "promote an apprpciation 
of the life and history of the Afro·American, as en-
couragement of an understanding of present status, and 
as enrichmpnt of the promise of the future " 

The general theme for the 1974 nationwide ob-
seivance is " Helping America Understand " 

On this occaSion, the HRC encourages all ci tizens in 
the county to hare actively In the observance of 
History Week and to partiCipate In any sc heduled local 
events .

task force, besides 
contacting professors 
about teaching Women's 
Studies courses, will also 
be coordinating lecture 
series, film series, 
seminars, and workshops . 
These will deal with 
subjects such as auto 
Qlechanics, self-defense, 
regal rights, sin gle 
parenthood, and returning 
students. 

The Medical Services 
task force will be 
evaluating the doctors and 
services available in the 
UCSD/La Jolla area. It will 
gather information on 
what UCSD student in-
surance will and will not 
pay for . Self-help courses 
will be developed and a 
referral service for i n-
formation on birth control 
and abortion will also be 
provided. 

The services provided 
by the Women's Center 
will be available to all 
UCSD students, regardless 
of sex. The Center has

Low 
Blows 
and Cbeap 

by EciwardSimons Shots 
Revelle Dogs Again 

Shakespeare, Ralf , and Amudor were peacefully 
sett led around a tree in the Revelle Plaza . As luck would 
have it, the wind wh ich had been blowing fiercely off 
and on through the day carried a copy of the Triton 
Times close to Shakey . 

" Interesante," he aid . The sleek cocker spaniel 
ambled over to the paper and st raddle!:! it to keep the 
page from moving as he read . 

Ralf raised a disgusted eyebrow . " I was under the 
impression you were 'house trained' some time ago, 
Shakey ." 

'What a shame the writer of this article wasn 't ," 
Shakespeare commented. 

"What're you reading," All - Messed - Up - Dog - Of -
Revelle asked , "Low Blows an'd Cheap Shots?" 

"Worse than that . It 's an article about the im-
poundment of stray dogs ." 

Amudor looked at Ralf . " Could that mean us?" 
Ralf shrugged . "I doubt it. I mean, I stay here all the 

time . That doesn't fit my definition of stray." 
"This article is just ," Shakey barked, " the very 

worst obtainable ." 
"Why do you say that?" asked Amudor . "What does it 

say?" . . 
"Well, it says that 25 students have be.en . bitten by 

dogs in the past three years . The only incident described 
is when a seeing-eye dog bit some chick . A seeing-eye 
dog wouldn't fit anyone's idea of a stray . Another 
problem is dog droppings, it says . Again , one instance." 
Shakespeare lool.ced at the newspaper wistfully. "Almost 
wish I weren't house-trained, " he mumbled . . 

Ralf rose to h is feet. The big German shepherd 
shook the loose grass off of his thick brown coat ." Jesus! 
Those allegations are ridiculous ." 

" Yeah, really," Amudor agreed . 
" I'm sure we just go around , wantonly biting students 

for no reason ," Sh akespeare added caustica lly . " I 
wouldn 't Qite one of those zombies on the leg if he had 
it wrapped with beef ." 

Ralf and Amudor glanced at Shakey With evident 
disbelief . 

"Well," Shakespeare relented , " not if it cam ~ from the 
cafeteria ." At this , Ralf and Am udor nodded In so lemn 
agreement. 

" Probably get some hei nous socia l disease from biting. 
'em, anyway." 

"No doubt " Shakey agreed , " though the chances ot 
getting it her~ in Revelle could bri ng down the national' 
average ." 

Ralf looked up from the newspaper. He looked angry.' 
" I've got half a mind to make this piece of yellow 
journalism a little more apparent to the casual glance ." 
He lifted a leg, considered, then brought it down again. 

"I'll agree with the first part of that statement," 
Amudor quipped . 

"You know," Shakey mused, " there are loopholes .. .' 
"What really bugs me," Ralf continued, "is that the 

only dogs they'll 'a llow' on campus are seeing-eye dogs 
What a joke! The only clear cut case of a dog bitin~ 
someone and who did it? - a seeing-eye dog . Gentlemen, 
I rest mv case ." 

"What bugs me is when these people from La Jolla brirJB 
their twin Afghans over here to 'walk them ' , as they call n. 
Ha! I know better," Amudor declared. 

" But listen," Shakespeare aid, " there's a way to get 
around this rule ." 

"What's that?" Ralf barked . 
"Seeing-eye dogs! All we have to do is wear dark 

sunglasses. Then we can take turns being each other's 
seeing-eye dog." Shakey m iled easily . " We're home 
free ." 

Ralf and Shakespeare both jumped up and leaped 
arou nd for a while, frolicking and rolling in the grass. 
Then they settled down long enough to start thinking 
about where they would get the shades . Amudor felt a 
little left out . He cleared his throat and spoke . 

"I counted, and I know there are only three of us. If 
you two are going to be dog and master, what do I doll 
mean, I'd look pretty silly wearing shades without 
seeing-eye dog" 

Shakey looked at Ralf. The big German shepherd 
could offer no suggestions. Shakey looked at A 
thoughtfully, his eyes focused somewhere hp\/Onrl 
Slowly, a smile crept across his face. He looked 
Amudor . . ' 

"Te ll me," Shakespeare conspiratorily asked, "do you 
play gu itar?"

Moving across the AN OVERVIEW 

The immediate concerns 
and needs facing the Art 
Center are definitely not 
obscure or whimmish . 
Rather they lie within the 
realms of reality; that 
reality being that the center 
must receive aid if it is to 
continue to serve the 
students at UCSD. The 
obvious question readers 
would be expected to form 
at this point is, why aren 't 

services would partly ex-
plain their inabili~y to 
provide the center with 
more than S3,6OO for next 
year's budget . UCSD 
happens to be one of the 
few campuses in California 
who must Pi'Y substantial if 
not all of the costs for many 
student services usually 
paid for by the state . One 
example of this is the fact 
that the University , not the 
state pays for the salaries of 
the personnel working in 
the Financial Aids Office. 
Over a year 's time this 
amounts to quite a chunk of 
the Reg . Fees' money. 

Nothing has come easy to 
the center since it opened 
two years ago, and in view 
of the Reg . Fee Committee's 
present situation, it is 
unlikely things will come 
easily in the near future . 
What should be applauded 
here is the center's abil ity to 
continue its operations 
withstanding all its present 
dilemmas . Sincerity 

overrides the need fOr 
therapy at the center ; it is 
obvious much more than 
" desire for release" prods 
students to struggle with 
the cold, with lack of 
sufficient kilns, with 

spectrum of the center's 
needs, the questions of 
funds lies yet unanswered .

Higher Education 
Subject of New Oass 

"The Legislature and Higher Education" will be the 
subject of a class to be taught Spring Quarter through 
the Contemporary Issues program at Muir College . The 
class which is being sponsored by the Student Lobby (her~ at UCSD), will cover three major aspects of public 
higher education . 
. During the quarter the issues to be explored are 1) 
Collective Bargaining in the University; 2) The Master 
Plan for the University & the Extended University, 3) 
Affirmative Action (at UC), specifically at UCSD. The 
class will meet as a whole to hear guest presentations 

I related to the topic areas .. 
John Stull, author of the famed Stull Bill on teacher 

accountability and Senator for the 38th District , has 
tentatively agreed to speak and a response is being 
awaited from Assemblyman Vasconsellos . Both men 
served on the Joint Legislative Committee on the Master 
Plan, the group which authored a document by the 
same name which deals with the U C. System . 

Students interested in the Course should sign up 
through the Contemporary Issues office (see Lola Ross 
in the Muir Provost's offi ce complex) or contact Lee 
Burke at x2493.

Time Running Out 

Time is running out on the Marijuana 
Decriminalization Initiative. As of last week, the 
petition drive was still 125,CXJO votes short of the goal 
that must be met by February 18. We must act NOW if 
the initiative is to have any chance at all . Celebrate the 
end of mid-terms by carrying a petition around campus 
or in your neighborhood. Numerous petitions are 
available in the Triton Times office. Signs for petition 
tables can also be obtained . 

Fourth College Academic Plan 
I Intellectual Character 

Like the other Colleges 'of UCSD, the 
Fourth College will be a liberal arts 
college in the best sense of that term . Its 
faculty will be in all diSCiplines 
represented on the campus and its 
students will major in all departments. 
The exceptional flexi bi I ity of the 
graduation requirements (see below) will 
encourage departments to develop 
special majors of greater than usual 
depth, and many students will be en-
couraged to complete double majors 
when that is appropriate to their in-
tellectual, professional, and career in-
terests. The College will encourage the 
development of interd iscipl inary 
programs based on the genuine interests 
of both faculty and students . It appears 
that the "programs of concentration" 
provide the best vehicle for this 
development. 

The College recognizes that while the 
responsibility for planning his post-
baccalaureate career lies principally with 
the student, it is important that the 
resources of the University be available 
to assist him . In particular, the College 
will inform its students of the wide array 
of professions and careers available, and 
provide an academic context in which 
preparation for them is possible. 

Finally, it is hoped that the College 
become a community to which its 
faculty and students have a lively at-
tachment. The experience of the campus 
shows thatthis is not easily done: the 

~rse interests of the faculty and 
. students make common intellectual 

experience difficul t to achieve. The 
Colloquium is one way in which the 
College will address this question. 

II The Graduation Requirements 

To graduate from the Fourth College, a 
student must, in addition to the 
university-wide requirements, complete 
the following: 

i A two-course sequence in writing. 
ii A two-course sequence in any 

subject which uses formal or a lgorithmic 
reasoning (symbol ic logic, computer 
science, mathematiCS).

Other equences, su h a~ one in 
PaRe 4, Triton Times FebruilIfY 15, 1974

sciences, are to be encouraged. 
iii A major 

A student in Fourth College may at-
tempt any major . The individual 
departments will establish the pre-
requisites for their majors . Some 
departments (e.g. Chemistry, Physics and 
AMES) will take advantage of the flexible 
breadth requirements to oHer majors of 
special depth . Other departments are 
encouraged to develop similar majors in 
the College. It is also anticipated that 
some of the cross-departmental or inter-
diSCiplinary programs of concentration 
will develop into major programs. This 
would occur after a program had 
established interest on the part of both 
faculty and students sufficient to warrant 
the increased scope and additional 
resources . 
iv Programs of Concentration 

A student must complete two 
programs of concentration, each of 
which consists of six courses. At least six 
courses of the total of twelve must be 
upper division courses, and at least one 
of the programs of concentration must 
be in a diSCipline area outside that of the 
major. 

The programs of concentration will be 
supervised by three faculty committees, 
one for each of the discipline areas : 
Humanities & Fine Arts, Social Sciences, 
Science & Mathematics . The mem-
bership of these area committees will be 
drawn from all the departments in the 
area in which the College has faculty. 
The committees will be active in the 
planning and development of the 
programs of concentration as well as in 
of their progress . Cross-departmental and 
inter-disciplinary programs are to be 
encouraged by the area committees ; as a 
general principle such an in-
terdiSCiplinary program should include at 
least one course which will provide a 
unifying function. 

Each year the individual area com-
mittees will approve between ten and 
fifteen programs of concentration in 
each area. It is understood that the list 
may change as the success of eac h 
program is appraised and as the needs 
and intere t s of the students and facu lty 
change. 

Students who transfer to the Fourth 
College from other institutions must 
complete the graduat ion reqUirem ents of 
the College Six of the twelve courses 
whi ch consti tute the program ~ of 
concentration must be taken at UCSO In 
order to determine which coursf'S may be 
applied to the grilduation requiremf'nts 
the Office of the Provost will make an 
evaluation of prior work for each student 
at the time of his first enrollment 

I I Special Programs 

I Colloquium 
Twice a year (in the rail and In the 

Spring) the College will sponsor a three 
day intenSive examination of a particu lar 
topic of wide-spread interest. DUring 
these three days, all of the ordinary 
operations of the College will be 
suspended so that its faculty and 
students can participate fully . There will 
be workshops, panel discussions, and 

lecture~ , depending on the topic , the 
tudents and faculty will participate

Open Letter To David Durkin 
By Leslie Todd 

Dear David : 
It was with more than a passing in-

terest that I read your letter in the T.T. 
concerning your dissatisfaction with the 
UCSD SOCiology department . The 
problem you· focus on is, of course, not 
unique to the particular department you 
seem to be most acquainted with . The 
problem is universal, in the widest sense. 
How many students, here and around the 
world, hope that the University might be 
the place where racism, sexism, poverty, 
war, exploitation, etc. are revealed for 
what they are? And hoW Iflany discover 
soon enough that the mechanisms 
behind every evil plaguing human 
existence are rarely dealt with in any 
serious way by the paragons of ex-
cellence that teach and control the 
schools? Not hope, but further 
disillusionment awaits every generation 
of students, as their professors strive to 
retain their mastery over their pupils 
under the guise of mastery over a 
" subject." All the evils found out there in 
the world exist in here at the University. 
But of course, the University is, after all, 
in the world. Laputa belongs to the 
imagination . 

Just how corrupting and degeneratin~ 
the University is reveals itself in the 
delusion that the escape form the 
stagnant morass of ethnomethodology 
(or ordinary lauguage philosophy, or 
structuralism or . . . ) lays open in the 
pages of Gall>raith ,Mead, Greer, Cleaver 
or Casteneda (or Marx or Freud or . .. ). 
Understanding the world and all its evils 
is not necessary in order to change it, 
either for better or for worse. Un-
derstanding the world is certainly not 
sufficient forchanging it.History is full of 
benignant and malignant accidents. And 
yet, ,with-out understanding, power is 
bland and uncontrollable. The power I 
am speaking of, the only power that 
matters to me as an earthly being, is 
political power. And though your 
professors may try to convince you that 
political power is the unique possession 
of those holding elected office and their 
appointees, the truth is that political 
power belongs to anyone or any group 
that is in a po ition to limit your life-
activity What di t inguishes the mugger 
or rapist from th e cou rts and pri ons 
when you stand before the will and 
mercy of either? What dlstinqllishes the 
professor from the legislator when both 
put coniditons upon your remaining 
whf're you want to be? From the former 
group you may try to escap , from the 
lattN you may take your leave; but 
wh<'rever you choose to go there are 
other rapists, judges, professors and 
legislators waiting, making their 
d mands, limiting your activity. The 
ma t rs understand the world, and they 
control it. Most of them will continue to 
exercise their power over you ,in such a 
way as to maintain that power. Main-
tenance of what is, not overhaul, not 
essays at what is not but ought to be, 
haracterizes the rapist as well as the 

university professor. Most ot those in 
whom we place so much hope and trust, 
our teachers and leaders of all kinds, are 
m r mechanics who spend their 
lifetimes primmin& and trimming the 
machines that ma~ them, that maintain 
th m, and which, since they owe their 
livelihood to them, they sanctify, invite 
us in to watch the mechanics at work, 

lure us into the grinding gears, praise us 
when we grease their palms or their egos, 
and in the end, we who came to watch, 
become watchmen ourselves . 

Teaching large classes and being 
condemned to publish meaningful 
contributions in one's field, are not 
hindrances to the university professor, 
but necessities if he is to perform his job 
and keep the machine running. A 
generation of teachers, of dismantiers, of 
creators would not be impossible. 
Professors set their own demands; they 
are the others they try to convince us are 
the ones who make them do what they 
do. legislators set their own demands, 
though they all claim to know what the 
people want,believe,desire, demand, etc. 
And we know what happens to the 
dismantlers and the creators: they're 
either fired or fired upon. look around 
you at those who have made it and tell 
me what you see? Are these the 
people to lead us out of racism, sexism, 
poverty, war and exploitation?"And who 
is standing in line to succeed them? Their 
proteges, for the most part, and a few 
idealists and dreamers that they will have 
no trouble in rendering impotent. They 
must be replaced, but they will not 
permit it. They possess the most powerful 
weapon of all : the power of silence . 
Nothing can make them re pond if they 
do not wish to. They can ignore anything 
they choose to ignore. And if they are 
confronted with something which they 
cannot ignore without weakening their 
power, they won't ignore it; they'll 
destroy it. 

Wherein, then, lies our hope? In giving 
them again and again something they 
will want to destroy? Perhaps. In saying 
"No" to them again and again? Perhaps. 
In trying to replace them legitimately? 
Perhaps. I n trying to educate the masses? 
Perhaps, but I doubt it, since the masses 
have their own peculiar way of learning 
things, and it's always the hard way . In 
trying to replace them illegitimately? If 
you'd like certain death . To ignore them, 
then? That's 'their prerogative; what is 
power for them is weakness for us . By 
liberation movements that aim at giving 
more people a chance to be machanics 
too? Unworthy of a reply. By course 
eva luations or writing letters to your 
congressman? Or maybe we should just 
think about it for a few centuries until 
there are enough people who really ar 
one way or the other? Yet, it is difficult to

do not care about their Victimization

Town 
Center 

The article " Planners and 
Developers Clash On Town 
Center" of Feb. 5th set the 
stage for re~ew~d 
discussion of the University 
Town Center development. 
The article led the reader to 
believe that the evening 
consisted entirely of a 
pitching bout between the 
developer and the city . 
Those present at the teach-
in may agree that the 
discussion was a bit more 
complex. In addition to 
those speakers mentioned 
in the article : Mr. Klein, Mr. 
Gilman, Dr. Grobstein, and 
Dr. Heifetz, were two key 
speakers whose subjects of 
expertise catalysed the 
prime issues on debate: the 
environmental impact, and 
housing. 

The question is not 
whether the U.T.C. will exist 
(its existence has already 
been predicated in the 
University Community 
Master Plan), but rather 
how large. Thus we come to 
the environmental 
ramifications of size. Also 
present on the panel was 
leik Myrabo, a grad student 
associated with the AMES 
and Chem Depts . He along 
with a group of 5 students : 
Joe Capora letti, Bruce 

Gardner, Tony Stanonik, 
Tom Webster, and Mike 
Zyda; under the direction 
of Prof . Kent Wilson, did a 
study of the "oxidant air 
quality impact on the San 
Diego Region by the 
proposed University Town 
Center Development ." This 
study was done at the 
request of the Planning 
Dept. of San Diego City, 
and was not a CAlPIRG 
study as stated in the Feb. 
5th article . A copy of the 
results went to the En-
vironmental Quality Dept. 
for their Environmental 
Impact Survey . In addition, 
the study was also partially 
supported by a small 
stipend form. the Graduate 
Student Council. 

Mr. Myrabo stated that 
" the primary source of our 
information to do this 
analysis came from a paper 
by Ashley Economic Ser-
vices Inc. who did an 
analysis in March 73 for the 
UTe.. deve lopers of the 
mark. potential for the 
proposed center . It was 
their primary conclusion 
that 'an exceptional op-
portunity is available for a 
regional shopping center at 
the proposed site' ." The 
Ashley report also sum-
marized the market sup-
port and from this doc~ment Myrabo and his 
group were able to define 
where the pe.oPle were 
coming from. Results of this

study yielded a computer-
based model abl e to 
calculate the auto 
emissions generated by 
customers in transit to and. 
from the U .T .C. The 
Planning Dept. calcu lated 
the total trip generation 
figures of 120,000 t rips/day 
for the originally proposed 
Phase I, II and III 
development, and 46,000 
trips/day for the second 
"reduced Phase I" proposal. 
Calculations thus showed 
that the Phase I scale would 
"probably cause the Federal 
oxidant quality standard of 
.08ppm to be extended an 
additional several times a 
year over the immediate 
UCSD region . . . the air 
quality impact of the 
originally proposed Phase I, 
II, and II development 
would be approximately 3 
times as great as Phase I 
alone! " The above statistics 
reflect significantly on the 
quality of the air we 
breathe. 
The second area of heated 
discussion was that of 
housing. Speaking on the 
subject was Mary Manaster, 
a city planner. According to 
Mrs. Manaster there are two 
key questions to be con-
sidered : 1) What kind of 
housing? 2) What price? The 
community plan specifies 
that 30 percent of the Town 
Center should be- in 
residential use in order to 
provide the center with 24 
hour vitality . But as Mrs. 
Manaster stated "we don't 
know what the housing 
needs are because there 
hasn't been a full-scale 
study of these needs ." In 
spite of the absense of a 
survey, the developers have 
already decided on "what 
kind" - " Iow·rise units (53(}-
40000)" and " high-rise 
units (over 540,(00)" . (Are 
these meant for students?> 
On an economic stand-
point, why shouldn't the

"after all, there is a ready 
market for middle to high 
cost housing." For Mrs. 
Manaster , there are alter-
natives to high housing 
costs. One approach is 
using the idea of "minimum 
critical mass", ie. high rent 
housing could help sub-
sidize a reasonable quantity 
of below-market housing. A 
second approach would 
utilize a provision of the 
Federal Housing Act (1969) 
w'hich has never been used 
in this area. It encourages 
the development of " ex-
perimental housing", 
particularly that which 
would combine low cost 
and increased livability 
through loan guarantees. 
There are ways to make the 
plan acceptable for 
everyone if those involved 
in decision making will 
follow a few guidelines: 1) 
Find out the housing needs 
of the community. 2) The 
developer should accept at 
least some of the 
responsibility . 3) There are 
a Iternatives to high cost. 

The issues of air quality 
and housing were only 
briefly covered in the Feb. 
5th article but they are 
tremendously important in 
determining the future of 
the University Town Center. 
In understanding the issues 
at hand it's necessary to 
look at all the facts . I hope 
I've cleared most of the 
am biguities . 

Sincerely,

".,.".: Musical Notes 
Tubuw 
Mille OIcifit Id 

V ...... leconk VIC 13-105 

Well, this appears to be 
the album to defy all ex-
pletives. During the twenty 
times or so I've played it for 
both myself .and others this 
week, we've generated such 
a cacophony of positive 
reactions that ,it'\ hard to 

anything in par-
ticuliar. 

My first listening reaction 
is perhaps most descriptive. 
You know how it is oc-
casionally at a really great 
concert or play when 
uncontrollably the blood 
rushes to your head and you 
tingle all over? Well that's 
the kind of dynamite this 
album is loaded with . 

Usually when one speaks 
of a "dynamite album" of 
course, it refers to a certai n 
explosive musical force. 
Here however its just the 

opposite. The album is 
tightly structured not to 
e)(plode. It generates an 
inner dynamic which 
ripples out in bells . 

The album is by and large 
Oldfield's one man show, in 
which he plays about a 
dozen -a nd-a-half in -
struments blending into an 
amazing multi-textured 
piece. The album has two 
sides, no individual cuts, 
and merely passes through 
a number of moods and 

directions. 
Side one is the initially 

more impressive of the two, 
starting off with a rippling, 
haunting, pattern on piano, 
joined by glockenspiel, 
organs and bass, which 
leads out into a web of 
variations on a texture. 

The beauty here lies in 
the variety of contrast of 
the instruments, from the 
tingling bells, the crisp 
piano, the heavy bass, 

.. _______________________________ ..... which paints an in -

strumental myriad of color . UCSD Theatre: 

Blood Wedding 
, 

"Blood Weddi"ll" From the title we 
get a taste of the power and the poetry in 
t his modern folk tragedy by Spanish 
playwrigh t Federico Garcia Lorca, whi ch 
will be presented by the UCSD Depart-
ment of Drama for seven performances 
beginn ing Friday, Feb. 22. 

The three-act play wi ll be directed by 
Michael Add ison, associate professor of 
drama, and wi ll be given in the UCSD 
Theatre, Build ing 203 , Ma tthews 
Campus. 
. Performances will be at 8 p.m. Feb. 22, 
23, 24 and 28 and March 1, 2 and 3. Due 
to the nature of the play, no seating will 
be perm itted after a performance begins. 

Admission is $2.50 for general ad-
mi ssion and $1.25 for students. Tickets 
are avi lable t hrough the UCSD Drama 
Department at 453-2000, ext. 2491 . 

" Blood Wedding" is the story of a 
young girl in love with a man who is so 
poor her father won't let them marry . The 
young girl 's f ather later arranges for her 
to marry the son of the wealthiest woman 
in the vi llage . The bride runs away on her 
w edding night wi th her formerlove , the 
groom pursues them and the two men kill 
each other. 

According to Addison , "The UCSD 
production strips away the external 
Spanish details of the play to focus on 
the primary .. actoon pattern and to 
concentrate on H.arzing Lorca's poetic 
vision of the theme. I asked the di rector 
i f he could clarify :hf phase " the external 
Span ish details" lnd was told that the 
desire in this prc. duction was to move 
"through an abstmct theatrical metaphor 
IOto the central ( ramati c action u f l l,c 
play " "As a cons .. ~uence," he said, "we 
are not conce rneo with any rea lization of 
" Spanish-ness" 

Neruda .) Lorca was suspected of leftist 
leanings during the Spanish Civil War 
and was killed in 1936 by the forces of 
General Francisco Franco. 

"The play depicts a very repressive 
society wh ich inhibits natural passions so 
much that emotional forces build to a 
breaki ng point," Addison said. "These 
forces ri p the fabric of society apart, 
leaving death and mourning in their 
wake." Addison explained the conflict as 
of "repressed and diverted passions and 
sexui'.l ity exploding into conflict within 
the shaping forces of a manipulative 
soc iety." 

Some criti cs have found "Blood 
Weddinll" to be the play in which Lorca 
best achieves an integration of poetry 
and drama. The moments of the play's 
greatest dramatic intensity are in verse. 
The poet Pedro Salinas said "Blood 
Weddinll" gives " . . . the concept of 
human fatality," and there is a greater 
abundance of poetic themes in this play 
than in "Yerm~" or "The House of 
Bernarda Alba." 

The set, designed by Daniel Dryden, is 
a round burnished metal platform which 
covers a mound of dirt. A massive metal 
object in th e center of the platform 
suggests the ri gidity of the ~ociety . 
Addison prefers that any more definite 
associat ions with the symbol be left to 
t he audience. 

Costume designer Deborah Dryden 
used coa rse fabrics in muted tones to 
crea te abst racted garm ents wh ic h 
symbol ically revea l character. 

It is amazing when really 
conSidered, that Oldfield 
bas ica lIy on Iy uses 
keyboards, percussion, and 
guitars to achieve thi s 
effect . It is the variations on 
an instrument that make it 
work. The guitars employed 
on the album for example 
include bass guitar, electri c 
guitar , speed guitar , 
mandol in-like guitar, fu zz 
guitars, acous ti c gui tar , 
double speed electric 
guitars, gui tars sounding 
like bagpipes, and so on ... 

One has to be amazed at 
the number of variations a 
gu itar can be brought to . 
This facet is then .climazed 
in the latter portion of the 
first side, as from a basic 
pattern , Vivian Stanshall. 
(formerly of Bonzo Dog 
Band fame) su cci nctly in-
troduces each instrument as 
it takes its turn at the 
melody l ine, finally 
climaxi ng in the in -
troduction : "Plus: Tubulilr 
Bells!" Ectasy. A chorus of 
girl s voices " ah" in the 
background. 

Side two, a subtler attack 
on similiar contrasts, uses a 
less predictable pattern , 
and an amazing segment 
with concert tympan i. After 
establ ishing a flowing style 
for nearly 20 minutes it then 
wrenches free and dashes 
into a folk sy "Sailor's 
Hompipe" whi ch generates 
into a trenzied climax. 

I could go on and on 
about the virtues of this 
album and sti II never really 
say much about it. Allow 
me to Simply say that this is 
the most continually 
listenable album I've en-
countered this year. I woLild 
recommend this album to 
nearly anyone, whatever 
your musical persuasion . 

Whe~ . 

News to Peruse: 

Well , it's finally hap-
pened . Someone has 
con structed a com-
puterized survey at-
tempting to correlate 
personalities with popular 
music tastes. His name is 
David Voelker and he 
constructed an inventory of 
100 rock music ians and 
groups, 40 rock 50ngs, and 
60 statements designed to 
reveal some facet of per-
sonal ity r tested 100 people 

and dumped the whole 
works into a computer. 

Som~ of the resul ts were 
quite inte rest ing, some 
expected: Jimi Hendrix and 

Marijuana use - and some 
suprising : Uriah Heep and 
"I read the newspaper 
often ." One of the most 
frequently appearinl 
personality traits was 
marijuana use, which 
correlated positively with 
15 different groups. The 
strongest: Spooky Tooth, 
Jethro Tull, Fleetwood Mac, 
and the Grateful Dead. Pot 
smoking identified 
negatively with Creedence 
Clearwater, Three ,DOl 
Nighl and The Carpenters. 

Politics was another itt:m 
that popped up often, but 
the results were lopsided: 
while 20 groups were 
correlated with the political 
left, one one identified with 
the right - The Carpenters. 

Sports fans prefer 
Chicago, the Guess Who, 
Three Dog Night and 
Creedence, and people who 
liked 2001 : A Space 
Odyssey l iked J. Geils Band, 
Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and 
"Purple Haze." 

Here's a strange one for 
you. If you sleep in the 
nude ch ances are the 
Beatie's "Come Together" is 
one of your favorites. (Draw 
your own interpretat ion!1-
The Greatful Dead was the 
only group to correlate with 
the statement, "A good sex 
l ife is of great importance 
to me." Unfortunately, the 
correlation was negative. 

Of course this survey was 
pretty simplisti c, but the 
pathway is clear. As David 
warns, if a guy appears on 
your doorstep trying to sell 
you Al ice Cooper albums 
because he knows you like 
snakes and have a doll 
collection , you'll know that 
the day has come. 

And for you statistics 
fans: Ever wonder what the 
difference between a gold 
record and a platinum 
record were in record biz? 
Well , a gold record is for a 
million dollars in sales, 
while the platinum record is 
given for a million units 
sold (which at S6.98 a LP is 
quite a few dollars indeed). 

TV appearances are in 
the wings for such diverse 
Warner Brothers artists as 
Alice Cooper and Rob 
McKuen . Alice will debut 
on the box as a young witch 
(typecast i ng?) on an 
episode of "The Snoop 
Sisters" entitled " And up 
Jumped the DeviL", while 
mellow McKuen has been 
signed for. appearance on 
"The Hollywood Squares" 
( whew , .... is this 
typecas ti ng??) .

Concentrat ion on the central dramatic 
act ion IS cert a inly a valid emphasiS, as it 
was the pr imal "ction of a newspaper 
account of an inCident In Al meria (nearly

Like To Read Plays? 
UCSD's Script Library, specializing in dramatic play 

scripts, has on hand almost 1,000 scripts by modern 
playwrights, and the ability to purchase any other play 
scripts requested. 

Many of the plays in the library are, for the most part, 
not available anywhere else, since hard cover " readirg 
scripts" are generally not published for several years, 
and then, only for " major plays," according to Larry 
Deckel, the library'S director. 

The library could be of great use to a large number of 
students for reference in contemporary dramatic 
literature as well as for recreational reading, he believes. 

Located in " the Space" building 257, Matthews 
Campus (formerly the Anomaly Factory) across from the 
quonset huts , the Script Library is open Mondays 9-10 
a.m., Tuesdays 4:30 - 5 p.m., and Thursday 9-10 a.m. and 
4:30 - 5 p.m. Books may be checked out for 2 weeks by 
UCSD students and faculty . For information or special 
arrangements, contact Larry Deckel, 453-9045.

SALK TO SPEAK 
HERE TUESDAY 

Dr. Jonas Salk, the genius behind the Salk Institute 
and the inventor of the polio vaccine, will be speaking 
at 8:30 pm on Tuesday, February 19th in the Revelle 
Cafeteria. He will speak on his own work his 
philosophy, and the current directionsof the institute . 
An informal discussion will ensue during which he will 
answer questions form the audience. 

While cancer research at Salk is well known, answers 
to m~ny other questions are being pursued there, most 
relatively unrelated to one another. Birth control 
through the manipulation of brain hormones is the aim 
of one research group, psycho linguists areinvestigating 
how man learns a language,and other people are trying 
to find a plausible theory for the origin of life. 

For those interested in finding out about the Salk 
I nstitute first hand, the Revelle Guest in Residence 
Comr.nittee, as well as bringing Dr. Salk to campus, is 
offering to take you to Salk Institute. 

The tour will be held the same day Dr. Salk is to 
speak, that is, one week from today, and you are invited 
to bring a sack lunch . One of their scientists will at-
tempt to explain something of the Institute, show you a 
film, and take you around . You can sign up for the tour 
(and a ride) at the Resident Dean's Office . Both the talk 
and the tour will be free .

developed to secure new sources of e nergy, there will 
be o ne eventually . Part of his course will involve ex-
plaining exactly why; another part will involve an 
examination of so lutions. Current research and popular 
theories on the energy problem will be paramount to 
the cour e . Dr. Thomas intends to keep the course 
relatively informal, and therefore will be open to 
student suggestions .

considerable f.n,flwc of shoppers ta ,uaranteed by 
this area's lacll of high Jlnance competition. In the 
developer'. eye, here sitteth a piece of cau. 

To put it in market analysta ter"", that ta, 01 the 
Ashely Economic Service. put it: 

Patterns of house..... lDeome dlroupout &he market

Apart /rom producing di.may in the hearts of 
some and money in the poeJtets of other., the UTC 
development would also produce hydrocarbons in 
the atmo.phere. Automobiles converging on the 
center should alter the ambient air quaiit)'. How 
much is uncertain. 

A computer model (SDAIR), developed by the 
undergraduates of The Senses Bureau for the 
purpose of predicti", the charlIe in air pollution 
stattstically caused by a given change in land 
usage. This model indicates an lncreGle In pollution 
should UTC be constructed. 

A group of .Lx student. worJted for over three 
weelts to apply the SDAIR model to the case of 
UTC. Their effort, under the direction of Dr. Kent 
Wibon, WGI to iriform the community, the ,overn" 
ment, and the developers of one ramijication of the 
proposed project. FollOwing is a .wnmary of their 
worll, written by them, includin, a description of 
the model Uled, the re.ult. obtained, and some 
suggestions for those involved. 

Nobody needs a computer analysis to discern that 
UTC will amply repay tho .. who invest money in it. 
However, the sentiment that UTC will not 
ameltorate either UCSD's or the surrounding 
commwtUy's envi~onment is not uncommon. The 
UTC proposal ta presently in abeyance impenrl.ng 
further ,"ve.tigation, and tho.e who feel their in-
terests are at stake may find thi. report 
galvanl.zlng. 

Thi UTC .tudy was requested by lack Van 
Cleave, A .. t.tant Planning Director of the Cit)' 
Planning Department, and WGI carried out by Lelk 
Myrabo, Ioseph M_ {;aporaletti, Bruce Gardner, 
Tony Stanonik, Thoma. F. Webster and Michael 
Zycla, under the auspices of Dr. Kent Willon . 
Financial support came from the National Science 
Foundation a"d the Graduate Student Council. 

Input To The SDAIR Model 
(1) The consulting firm of Ashley Economic Services 

in their marketing analysis study (dated March 16, 1973) 
for the proposed University Town Center. described the 
geographical position of the four primary market areas 
and the percentage of customer financial support that 
each would provide . On the basis of this market 
analysis, we have calculated the automobile emissions 
that would be generated by these customers in transit to 
& from the University lown Center. 

(2) The total trip generation figure of 46.000/ day for

UTe may also cause atmospheric pollution to exceed 
Jeaalltancbnk more often in the area of ueSD_ 
the second "reduced Phase I" proposal was obtained 
from the San Diego City Planning Department. Also 
received from the Planning Department was a 
description of the Attraction Constrained Mathematical 
Model, which was used in our analysis to distribute the 
attracted trips per market area to smaller statistical 
subareas. 

(3) the emissions factors relating vehicle miles and 
primar( air pollutants and the base case emissions for 
the basin are careful estimates for 1975, and thus, for 
simplicity, UTC is evaluated as if it all were to be in 
existenCe in 1975, in spite of the fact that actual con-
struction might be phased over a longer period. 

Results 
Our detailed analysiS of UTC traffic patterns indicates 

that the average trip length is about 9.2 miles/ trip, as 
opposed to the City Planning Department's estimate of 
7.0, and the developer's value of 3.7. 

TotaJ reactive hydrocarbons generated by the traffic 
associated with UTC amounts to about 1500 kg/ day or 
anincreasein approximately 1% of the total predicted 
1975 automotive emissions for the whole San Diego air 
basin (155,000 kg/ day) . It is interesting to note that San 
Diego air basin traHic emissions (reactive hydrocarbons 
variety) equal 84% of the overall 1975 total - which 
includes both fixed sources (i.e . power plants, airport • 
ground operations, gas stations, dry cleaning establish-
ments, etc .) and mobile sources (automobile trucks 
etc .). ' , 

As a result of running the SDAIR model on the 
proposed University Town Center, it can be said that the 
Phase I scale would probably cause the Federal oxidant 
air quality standard of .08 ppm to be exceeded an 
additional several times a year over a significant portion 
of the San Diego region immediately surrounding 
UCSD. 

Recommendations To Govern-
mental Agencies And Concerned 
Citizens 

We recommend that the developer of any proposed 
new complex source in the San Diego Air Basin be 
required to generate a county-wide analysis of the 
traffic pattern both before and after the development is 

~ssumed completed. Such a procedure would improve 
the present traffic studies which do not take into ac-
count either

A Stab At Fencing 

II UNTITLED V 
by Mark Liska 

It reminds me a little bit 
of the commercial with the 
computer repairman . You 
know, the guy who couldn't 
graduate from eighth grade 
and can type faster than he 
ca n read Dick and Jane 
books . Anyway, this guy's in 
a brand new suit driving a 
brand new Porsche 914, or 
is it 911? - well , what's the 
difference . He's got a bright 
smile and painted perfect 
white teeth . His speech 
starts out with something 
like, " I want to work with 
my hands. but not get any 
d irt under the fingernails ." 
The statement seems to 
have an allegory in fencing -
" I want to be a jock but I 
don't want to get hurt, have 
a giant pair of biceps, (or 
whatever else you might 
like to include in here) ." 

People that fence are the 
c ultured elite of the sport 
world . They abhor the 
violence that is inherent in 
football or rugby . You'll 
p robably never spot them in 
a ballroom brawl. They 
revel in history and culture 
a nd know everything from 
Shakespeare to Napeleon 
when it comes to Europe . 
They frown upon those 
new-Bourgeoisie slobs who 

play tennis . That sport is 
simply getting too crowded 
for these loners and 
besides, it's gotten to the 
point that even the simplest 
peon who makes S40,OOO a 
year can play . Fencing 
elitists pass off this sport 
and head for higher ground . 

Fencers are the kind of 
people that eat at fine 
French restaurants . (It has 
to be a French restaurant 
since all the famous fencers 
- including the Three 
Musketeers and Douglas 
Fairbanks - seem to have 
French names that end in 
oux, or eau and are fighting 
for the queen.) Their meal 
naturally begins with a fine 
French wines, such as 
Chateau Margot 1967 and 
includes some hors 
d'oeurves . The main course 
would be beef , naturally, 
like Steak au Paul/re . For 
desert one would finish up 
with an after dinner apertif. 
If one was in a restaurant 
and observed th is dinner, 
chances are his epee would 
be in the car . 

The question that tickles 
the mind a little bit is why 
someone would ever 
choose fencing over more 
co nventional activities . 
One answer might be 

PE Credit Alive 

Extension Granted 
by Eric Raisters 

Last Mo nd ay afternoon . the Committee o n 
Ed ucational Pol icy met to vote on a measu re to give 
o ne-half un it credit to Physi ca l Education Classes . The 
Committee d eCided to postpone the vote for two weeks . 

Th~ volunteer student group that has been trying to 
convin ce the CEP that students want the c redits and 
that PE courses have academi c me rit we re able to 
collect only 400 sig natures . mostly by taking the time to 
wa lk through several of the dorms asking people to sign 
the petitions . 

. If the movement is to succeed. many more signatures 
will have to be collected in the week and a half that 
remains before the C EP meetin g (nearly three to four 
t housand more. by the estimate of the volunteer 
students) . 

It is for this reason that the volunteer students are 
asking for help with the actual carrying around and 
asking people to sign the petitions as well as people to 
vo lunteer to talk with the CEP members (a list of which 
was printed last week in the Triton Times. 

A new development has arisen in the arguments for 
t he proposition, and that is that all PE credits from other 
UC campuses are automatically transferred to the 
students UCSD transcript and can be used toward 
graduation . 

Th is is a disadvantage to the UCSD student because 
he is unable to get credit for his PE classes, ~hile the 
transfer student can use as many as eight classes (four 
units) fro m any PE classes toward th eir graduat ion . This 
holds at UCSD in all but a few cases; such classes as 
Sc uba a nd Skin Diving . Nutrition a nd Fencing have 
bee n abl , after much wrangling with th CEP to obtain 
cred it. '

because of the French 
culture and fancy 
vocabulary one gleans from 
the c lass . Another 
possibility is that the class is 
required . Many clubs and 
fraternities require that 
fencing be taken as part of 
their entrance 
requirements . These ideas 
are sound but hold as much 
water as a sieve. There must 
be a deeper, more' relevant 
meaning behind fencers . 

Fencing is a graceful 
elitist means of learning ali 
those things that other 
sports teach . It is exce llent 
for reactions, believe it or 
not, ranking seco'nd only to 
handball or squash . It is a 
very fast-moving game and 
requires speed and 
quickness . If you have ever 
watched the sport , you 
know how hard it is just to 
keep your eyes moving 
back and forth . 

Win Streak Extended to Two, 
Spikers Face OMBAC Tonight 

It also requires strength . 
Fencers often make the 
same movements over and 
over again . Fencers also use 
structure form and 
positions . This serves to 
develop certain muscles 
that the fencer didn 't know 
he had (any beginning 
fencer can surely attest to 
this fact as he lies awake at 
night, writhing in pain with 
a tight unknown muscle ). 

There i< <till someth ing 
else, some unnameable 
someth ing that you can't 
put your fingers on It 's for 
people who like to be 
unique . These people st rive 
to h ave class , to d o 
somet hin g different. 
Probably, this is why UCSD 
has one of the best fencing 
programs around .

tercollegiate Volleyball

tators need seeing-eye 
dogs to follow the action , 
the Tritons showed their 
mettle as they demol ished 
lBCC in four sets. Even the 
referee, who had no 
linemen or umpire. and 
who excused his bad calls 
by saying he "had a co ld". 
could not stop UCSD from 
winning the match . 

In the first set. the 
Tritons, playing without 
Tim Myrick and Mike 

McMahon . who were not 
able to make the trip, fell 
behind in the early going, 
9-2. Setting a new stan-
dard for volleyball team s 
at UCSD. lhe Tritons made 
a spectacular comeback 
to tie the game at 14-all 
The novelty of th IS 
position, as well as some 
bad passes, gave the first 
game to the opposing 
team . 

The second set saw the 
Tritons again falling 
behind in the early goi ng, 
but after settling down to 
consislent playing, the 
Tritons were able to slip 
past Long Beach, 16-14 . 

The third game saw the 
Tritons dominating LBCC 
in every department, as 
they tore the Viking 
defense apart . 15.f>. The 
last set again saw UCSD 
falling behind , 9-2 and 14-
9, but with another great 
comeback effort . led by 
everyone's digging and 
h itting, UCSD battled 
back to a 14-14 tie . The 
game then progressed to 
15-15. with both sides 

trading se rves and spikes. 
and was finished by two 
quick serves and blocks by 
the Tritons. 

Everybody played well 
in the games, but sp ecial 
mention must be made 
about Ceorge Yamashita, 
who . c old and all . 
replaced Myrick in the 
front row, and had many 
awesome blocks and h its

under . around and 
through the LB blocks 
were hitters Bruce Caz-

also had an excellent day 
blocking. and ErIC 
Raisters, who made hiS 
first start of the season 

Pass ing was the best 
that it has been all season. 
and thiS was due mainly to 
the work of Mark Duret 
and Dave Rosenberg . the 
local back-row speCialists 

All in all , the triP up to 
Long Beach was an 
educational experience 
for all , and the Vikings will 
be returning the favor 
when they mkke a visit to 
the confi nes of the old 
main gym next Wed-

The Tritons are looking 
forward to this rematch to 
prove t hat their win was 
no fluke, but before they

Women Cagers 
Down USIU 

Monday afternoon the 
women's intercollegiate 
basketball team ran USIU 
right off the court , There 
didn't seem to be much 
question from the opening 
jump shot as to who would 
take the game, The Tritons 
held the lead from the start, 
increasing the gap between 
the scores with each 
quarter. By the end of the 
game, the women easily 
conquered their opponents 
by a 35 point margin 57-22, 

Always in the thick of 
action, Judy Lower deftly 
handled the ball, bringing 
in 30 points . Right behind 
her were Allison Chin, 
Aliena Salmon and Oiana 
Barba . Their indiVidual 
experience on the te,am was 
evident, but it was the 
organized teamwork that 
ultimately served as the 
catalyst to win the game.

Tomorrow night at 8 

p.m. in the main gym the 
UCSD league basketball 
fortunes will be on the 
line as they take on 
league leading Fresno 
Pacific College . 
Presently the Tritons are 
in third place with two 
league games remaining. 
If they win both games 
they still have an outside 
shot at the league title. 

In non-league action 
Tuesday night the 
Tritons hosted a very 
tough USD five and 
came out on the short 
end of the 83~3 score. 
The game itself was 
decided in the first 8 Y, 
minutes as USD , 
utilizing a full court 
press, jumped out to a 

24-4 lead . From that 
point on the Tritons 
managed to play even-
up basketball, but it was 
way too late to salvage a 
win , 

UCSD did manage to 
play with spirit 
throughout the game, 
mak ing several charges 
at USD but never getting 
any closer than 14 
points . Mark Read came 
off the bench to lead the 
Tritons with 12 points. 
George Calhoun tossed 
in another 11 points 
followed by Steve 
Kircher and Steve 
Higgins with 10 points 
apiece, and Joe Co it and 
Paul Trainer with eight 
points each , 

The deciding factor in 
the game was obviously 

USD's superior height as 
th~\' dominated the 
boards at both ends of 
the court, getting off two 
or three shots to every 
one that UCSD took. The 
USD press, in the early 
stages of the game took 
its toll as the Tritons 
committed numerous 
turnovers in the early 
part of the game. 

As far as crowd en-
thusiasm and the 
cheerleaders were 
concerned it has never 
been better . The 
cheerleaders did several 
new routines and the 
crowd came to life in the 
second half as the 
Tritons made a couple of 
charges at USD while 
employing a full court 
press of their own .

Fourth College Continued from Pale 4 
IS to provide an environment in which the expert 

knowledge available on the campus and in the com-
munity is brought intensively to bear upon a particular 
topic , All the members of the College community 
should find such an environment conducive to the 
sort of intellectual exchange which otherwise rarely 
occurs. Among the many topics which has been 
proposed for the Colloquia are : 

The Energy Crisis; Moral Questions Raised by 
Science; International Relations in the Last Quarter of 
the Twentieth Century; Urban Planning and Urban 
Technology, 
ii Career Planning 

Since the majority of the graduates of UCSD and of 
Fourth College seek employment or specific 
professional education upon graduation, the College 
will be concerned that its students are aware of the full 
range of career and profeSSional opportunities available 
to them. This will involve more extensive career advising 
than presently available , In addition, the College will 
develop field placement. intern · programs, and other 
forms of academically directed employment experience 
to supplement the basic liberal arts education which it 
offers , Although the extent of these programs will 
depend upon the interest of the faculty of the College, 
the flexible college requirements and the intensive 
coop ration of the Office of the Provost should provide 
many opportunities for faculty sponsorship of useful 
and interesting programs,

the development which would be diverted by the 
development. (For example, a Del Mar resident might 
decide to shop at UTC rather than Fashion Valley . This 
factor results in an over estimation of air quality impact 
due to this project.) 

(2) accelerated growth which may be caused in areas 
adjacent to the development thereby creating increased 
local traffic (Tlie leaving out of this factor leads to an 
underestimation of the air quality impact of UTC.) , 

Computer programs for such analyses exist and are 
available to commercial consultant groups , They can be 
used to provide the accurate information necessary to 
more exactly compute the environmental impact of 
such a development. This would allow more accurate 
analysis of the changes in traffic congestion. air 
po llution, and energy usage generated by a proposed 
project, 

Open Letter To David Durkin 
Continued from Page 4 

abolition of all courts and all prisons? Why look for 
more creative and critica l teachers and legislators when 
what is really wanted is the end of all Universities and 
Legislatures? What is really wanted is really impossible. 
We should be demanding from our Universities not 
better theories of racism and sexism, but that the 
masters of them cease being racists and ' sexists. We 
should demand from our Legislatures not more civil or 
human rights legislation, but that their members begin 
acting like civil, human beings. We should, in short, be 
revealing the masters for what they are, 

Durkin and I have offered a few observations of our 
own. for whatever they might be worth , I hope that 
o thers will do the same.

.clculty do most of their 
work in ethno-
methodology." Secondly, 
Dr, Cicourel suggests that I 
review a series of eleven 
classes which deal "with 
areas of sociology that have 
nothing to do with ethno-
methodology, " This, he 
believes will thoroughly 
contradict my proposition 
that the U.C.S.D. SOCiology 
department is committed to 
the promotion of 
ethnomethodology as a 
"pet theory". 

In' regards to the first 
point, let me say the 
following. Dr. Cicourel's 
implication that only 'I. of 
the sociology professors are 
ethnomethodologists is 
simply not true , It might be 
possible that only 'I, of the 
faculty are primarily 
engaged in ethno-
methodological research , 
But the percentage of 
professors who concentrate 
on ethnomethodology in 
the undergraduate 
classroom is certai nly larger 
than 33% In fact, this 
percentage includes a 
substantial majority of all 
professo(s as well as nearly 
all senior faculty , Dr. 
Cicourel is certainly more 
of an authority than I on 
what type of sociological 
research is being done in 
the department , But I 
respectfully consider myself 
more of an. authority than 
he on the content of un-
dergraduate sociology in 
the classroom situation, 

Dr , Cicourel 's second 
critique, that of 11 course 
titles which sUPi>0sedly 
have nothing to do with 
ethnorltt!{nooolUgy, re -
minded me of a well 

x 

traveled cliche ... " You 
can't tell a book by its 
cover" . Tra slated into 
sociological terms , this 
could mean "You can't tell 
a class by its title", Based 
on personal classroom 
experience, I can 
categorically state that 
several of the courses 
mentioned by Dr, Cicourel 
are tau~ht from a strol1g 
ethnomethodological per-
spective . Its common 
knowledge among 
sociology majors that 
course titles and course 
descriptions are often 
atrociously inaccurate . 
Regardless of the class title. 
the majority of sociology 
classes are taught with a 
bias toward 
ethnomethodology, Of the 
13 undergraduate sociology 
classes offered in the 
Winter , 1974 schedule, I am 
certain of at least seven 
which will emphasize the 
theory of ethno-
methodology in one form or 
another, Several of those 
courses mentioned by Dr. 
Cicourel fall into this 
category.
