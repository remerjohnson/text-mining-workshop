Detnocrats betray 
• • party, gIve In 

to Deuktnejian 
By PETER MORTEN EN 
Tom Bradley's defeat in his 

gubernatorial contest with 
George Deukmejian has to be a 
bitter one for Bradley, and for 
all those who consider 
themselves above allowing 
race to figure in the evaluation 
of a candidate's quali fication 
for public office. Had Bradley 
been elected , it would not have 
been because Californians are 
ready for a black governor; it 
would have, I hope, been 
because Tom Bradley was 
most qualified for the positIOn. 

Sadly, though, the opposite 
holds true in this case. Bradley 
was not elected, an IndicatIon 
to me that Californians are not 
ready for a black governor 

tatewide election returns 
suggest to me that Deuk· 
mejian won not because a 
plurality of voters felt he was 
the best person for the job, but 
because a minority of "race 
conclous" (read racist) voters 
who would have ordinarily 
voted along conventIOnal 
Democratic party lines crossed 
to vote for Deukmejian, or 
chose not to vote at all , because 
they were in some way 
repulsed by Bradley being 
black. 

I realize thiS IS a difficult 
hypothesis to proye. A little 
L'om m(m sense applied to the 

~ltua tlOn along with a basic 
understanding of American 
politics, though, will bear me 
out. 

Consider the other state· 
Wide races in which 
Democrats opposed Republi· 
ca ns . (This excludes the 
contests for U.S. senator and 
s tate ' uperindendent of 
schools. Jerry Brown 's 
Sickeningly sweet romantic 
view of politics turned voters 
to the bland but palatable Pete 
Wilson. But bland things have 
a way of sitting in your 

~tomach. I predict indigestion 
as early as january. And the 
vote for schools chief is 
uppo edly nonpartisan, even 

though Riles and Honig bear a 
startling resemblance to a 
Democrat and a Republican.) 

Particularly relevant to this 
argument are the election 
results for lieutenant 
governor, secretary of state, 
attorney general and 
treasurer. In each case, the 
Democrat won by nearly 10 
percentage points over his or 
her Republican challenger 
None of t he~e con tests was 
distinguished to the extent 
that a negative image of the 
candidates cou ld have been 
laid in the minds of a 
significant number of voters 
from both parties. D mocrats, 

who held a maJonty among t he 
voting population in thiS 
election toed the party line -
perhaps even with t he help of 
ome liberal Republicans who 

found objectionable the 
generally conservat ive nat ure 
of their party's offering. 

Then what could have 
caused this Democratic 
majority to betray party 
conventions and vote for 
Deukmejian or vote not at all 
in the gubernatorial race? As 
with the above four offices, the 
gubernatorial election was 
relatively calm; a little less 
than the standard amount of 
political mud was s lung. What 
was different ,.,as the ethniC 
background of the Democratic 
candidate. Tom Bradley is 
black. In new!-.paper pictures 
and on televiSion screeens, he 
is black. You can 't tell whether 
a man or woman believes in 
the deat h penalty by looking at 
hiS or her image . Even 
something as basic as honesty 
doe~n't tell on the face . But 
being black docs. And for the 
disgusting minority who 
discriminate on the ba~ls of 
race - whether consciouslv or 
subconsciousl~, act1vel\ " or 
pa~slvely - tom Brad"ley's 
fare told It all. 

A "orn' few fkmouat lC 
,'uters bei rayed t heir part}. 
and, in my mind the Ix""t 
umdidat e for t he Job by 
stopping at the face and 
ignOring the issues raisc'Cl hy 
the man Tom Bradley. 
Nat urally. ,>ome Repu blican 
\ oters who su pported 
DeukmeJlan may have 
conSidered Bradley's race as 
an j""ue. While unfortu nate, it 
is of lesser Importance because 
it IS a mentality I expectlo flOd 
among the more conservative 
Republicans. And they showed 
in the elections for other 
statewide offices that a 
majority of the party would 
have voted f()r Deukmejian 
without regard for any 
opponent's personal or 
political ideologies. 

I realize that my analysi of 
the situation may be 
oversimplified, and I hope you 
understand this is attributable 
to a lack of time and certain 
resources. I'm not even sure 
that I can't do any better than 
to provoke you to think about 
the issue. I would like nothing 
more than to come upon an 
alternative explanation to the 
election results, an explana· 
tlOn that would tak away the 
anger In me brought by the 
knowledge that even among 
tho,>e who conSider them·

Letters to the Editor 

AS investigation into Reggie 
Williams proves inconclusive 
Editor: 

In regards to the article 
dated Oct. ]8, 1982 pertaining 
to Mr. Reggie Williams and the 
Umversity type etter: 

It is important to remember 
to maintain the policy that al\ 
people are innocent until 
proven t,TUilty; adopted from 
the United States Constltu· 
tion. It is 10 t he best in terest 
for the Guardian to undertake 
responSible journalism In 
researching any and all 
allegation.., against an 
organization or an individual. 
to ayoid possi ble erroneous 
allegations and or potent ially 
libelous statements. I do not 
'iupport and do not feel that the 
l niversity supports the not ion 
that a school ne\\'~paper\ 

responsibility IS to assume the 
role of a judge but rather 
support the theory that 
newspapers should be non· 
biased, factual, and informa· 
tive publications. Facts are 
facts and should be printed as 
such. 

The Media Board and 
Commissioner of Communi· 
cations Lisa Lincoln deter· 
mined through their own 
invest Igat ion of t he matter 
that there is no \\ay to prove 
any of the al legations that the 
Cuardiall irresponsibly 
printed towards Mr. Reggie 
Williams. The AS in Its own 
research ha ... determined that 
while t here may be procedural 
problems III the v\ a~ the 
typesetter i~ assigned to the 

Media, we are cu rrently 
revamping typesetter poliCies 
which willi elimmate the 
problems we have had in the 
past. 

Therefore. as Commissioner 
of Student Welfare I am deeply 
concerned for the rights of Mr. 
Williams and all students. 
along v.lth the implications 
that this situation has made 
nece!-.sary to exanllne. [ 
respectfully requesl a 
retractIOn and an al)Qlo~n 
addres-,ed Il) Mr . Reggi e 
\VII hams and to t he AS. I urge 
the Guardian 10 assume a 
more responsible role in 
reportmg news on t hiS campus 
in the future.

Do you . .loon Sung. know 
ho\\ long t hesl stl'rl'otypes

thing to write about that you 
have to rehash t he same old

the lint in your navel next 
time; 11 might be a lad more 
original (maybe avant·garde 
physio·vi su al sensation 
producing art would be a good 
title for such an article). 

From my observations, 
EEC and pre medical 
students are extremely hard· 
working and dedicated 
students. They have goals and 
they work to achieve them. 
Those that make It through 
these programs should be 
congratulated, not sneered at. 
The intellectual challenge of 
these programs IS obviously 
beyond Joon Sung, who 
eviden tly has lilt Ie to talk 
about beSides "gir ls," 
"parties." and "sex" (that is 
all he talked about in the 
article any\.,ayl. Even 
Communications, which jmn 
Sung seems to pass off as an 
easy major, is probably too 
advanced for him. 

As for hiS statem nts 
concerning undeclared

Students in Action 

An interview with " Friends of 
Sierra Club" founder Dan Kolk 

By LISA LAPIN 
Opinion Edilor 

Dan Kolk . a senior at 
Revelle, is a biology major and 
the founder of t he latest 
campus organization; The 
Friend,\ v/lhe Sierra GIl/b. 

Guardian: Why did you fed 
It wa'i Important to have a 
Sil'rra Clllb branch on 
campus? 

Kolk: ThiS school has a 
large population of biology and 
science majors and there are 
organizations present on 
campus for a ll purpose, but 
there were none in existence 
for environmental move· 
ments. It seemed that wit hour 
scienc focus that there would 
be a strong potential for 
interest. I was approached by 
Jay Powell . the Con 'ervation 
Coordinator for the San Diego 
Chapter, who was interested 
in starting a branch at UCSD, 
'0 I took it from there. 

Guardian: What got you 
interested in the Sierra Club? 

KoJk: Right now we are at a 
dangerous period with respect 
to our re 'ources, due to the 
current Reagan Administra· 
tion. There has been a 
deregulatIOn of dangerous 
chemicals, such as carClno· 
gens, insecticides and 
herbicides. The acid ram 
problem is being ignored. The 
Environmental Protection 
Agency is not leveling fines. 
and there IS a lack of 

enforcement of environmental 
laws. These problems need to 
be dealt wit h immediately. In 
order to cause a change In 
society you have to take a 
means which is social ly 
acceptable. The Sierra Club is 
a well established organiza-
tIOn with over 300, 000 
members and a strong lobby In 
congrpss. It is a legitimate way 
to cause change In faw)r of the 
nation's environment. 

Guard ian : What Issue 
should UCSD students be 

The most recent 
election was a 
diaster fo r our 
environment in 
Calzforn ia. 
most concerned with? 

Kolk: The most recent 
election was a disaster for our 
environment in California. 
Governor elect D ukmejian 
has openly stated that he 
wants to open the California 
coast to offshore oil drilling. 
This would mean the presence 
of 011 fields as dose as three 
miles to the an Diego 
coastline. Anyone who 
remembers what happened in 
Santa Barbara knows the 

potential for dl"aster here. 
Guardian: What do you 

recommend students do with 
an Issue of concern such as 
offshore drilling? 

Kolk: They couln write a 
letter to Deukmcjlan statlOg 
that the\ don't want to see 
drilling (lff of our coast. If their 
t Imc is too yaluable to give to 
the campus club. [ would 
recommend that t hey JOin the 
national group. If they' have 
more time J suggest t hey sit in 
on the meetlllgs of t he Friends 
0/ the Sierra Club and become 
in\!olved in our organization. 
More immedi'atley they could 
write to congressmen about 
the current problems with acid 
rain. carcinogens, the EPA. 
offshore drilling, and Watt's 
allowance of oil drilling in 
natural reserves. 

Guardia n : What doe ' the 
Sierra Club repre ent, and 

'what is their current 
platform? 

KoJk: The Sierra Club 
defines itself as a conservation 
organizat ion for the promotion 
and preservatIOn of \\ IIdhfe. 
They organize outings and 
outdoor actiVIties becau!ie 
they want to educate people 
about the beaut\' of the 
outdoors and the irnportance 
of preserving it. ThiS IS the 
first year they ha\e endorsed 
IXllitical candidates. and t his IS 
due to the ecologlcall} 

dangerous programs heing 
promoted by james Watt. He 
wants to sell more government 
land thiS year than ha" heen 
sold In the last 35 years wtal. 
The Sierra Club would like to 
compromise. but Wat t i<; 
unv\ iliing to make an\' 
concessIOns. Another Reagan 
AdministratIOn problem IS 
t hat the EPA IS being 
dismantled. The Sierra Cluh 
saw these factors as so 
detrimental to the environ· 
ment that the\" felt that their 
onlv comeback would IX' to 
hecome politically active 
They are endorsing candidate" 
\\ho are In favor of

Guardian: What do you 
hope to alhle' t' \\ ith Frll'lId~ (~r 
Ihl' :Jifmr Club? 

Kolk: We have such a w(,l1-
roundt'Cl campus with 'iuch 
-.trong background ... in 'iL'ienn'. 

t hat we wou Id hin e a great 
ability to promote change in 
sodet y. I hope I hat mem her"

Strange structures on 
campus a re identified 
confinued from page 5 
out ide. beginning with a 
mural of a student sitting 
under a eucalyptus treee with 
Central Library in the 
background. Extending 
outward from thi image are 
dark-skinned peoples, followed 
by groups of animal pairs. The 
work i igned by "Louise 
5/76." 

Other mailer work are a 
painting of "City Lights" by 
"Skip, Class of '81" and a 
Grateful Dead keleton with 
roses by "Randi," who leaves 
her phone number and avs 
he specializes in art work for 

"Dead heads." A bit of 
literature exist on the walls 
in an implonng voice saying. 
"Oh . peak again bright angel 
for thou art as glorious to thi!' 
night" and simply signed. 
"MUlR." 

The building itself wa . once 
a water storage tank for Camp 
Matthews. according to 
Gordon of the Vi ual Arts 

pace and Facilities Depart· 
ment. When taken over by the 
Univer ity in the mid-60s, 
doorways were dnlled through 
the thick concrete and it was 
used for furniture storage and 

inventory purposes. 
In 1972, tHe VA Department 

gained u e of the facility and 
renovatd it as work pace for 
faculty arti ts. It pre ently 
contains eight odd·shaped 

tudios, and although 
omewhat unkempt, they 

serve a basic purpose of space 
and lighting for various 
projects by painters, sculptors 
and filmmaker. 

Earlier, and reputedly 
"better" painting exi ted on 
the outer wall until they were 
covered with a coat of sterile. 
cream colored paint at the 
opening of the ·tudio. The 
present drawing~ are fairly 
recent. in spite of the fact that 
they are se\erely chipped and 
peeling. 

Another remnant of the 
Marine camp is the Che Cafe 
buildinJ:!. which \\ as crated 
from odd~ and ends of Camp 
Matthews and combined intoa 
supposedly lemporary 
structure. The temporary 
status became permanent 
when the Che Cafe kitchen 
and the Guardiall offices 
mO\'ed in. Now the bUIldmg 
has a charming "clubhouse"

Atkinson holds 
etnpty open foru1n _DOO ______ ~Gfd1ta~· 

By RAYDELLE ARCHIVAL 
Slaff Wriler 

Only 11 students responded 
to Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson's open invitation to 
meet with him and discuss 
student issues, gripes and 
questions during the Chancel-
lor's monthly open forum 
meeting held for students last 
Friday, Nov. 5 at 11 a.m. in the 
Student Center's North 
Conference Room, 

The atmosphere of the 
meeting was informal and 
relaxed. While he listened 
intently to the students 
pre ent. Atkinson app ared 
reserved, calm and unawareof 
many of the student issues 
being raised. Although the 
grou p that at tended was 
:-;mall. several key issues were 
brought up, and the meeting 
prmed to be an interesting 
one, as well as an mformative 
one for the Chancellor. 

The meeting began With the 
'iubjecl of funding a 
coordmator for Ihe Women's 
Center (WO. The members of 
the WC who \ ~'ere pre~ent felt 
I hat the $3,000 funding for the 
roord1l1utor should fall on the 
unI\,ersrlr iOstead of . AAC, 
t fll' Stlident Afflrmatl\ t' 
\ct!lln Committee Thc\' also 

t '\ pn'""l'Cl t hei r m'l'd~ -for a 
coordinator, c1aimmg that an 
Indrvldual was necessan' for 
I he orgamzal ion 10 ':kl'cp 
going. " 

"E\t'rythmg is mlunll'er. 
f~lght no\\', howewr. wc are 
getting to the lXlInl where we 
need a lot of updating on files, 
more pt.'ople arc in\'ol\'t.'Cl and 
It's getting confusing. We need 
one person on \\' hom we can 
focus thIngs," Silld one 
member. 

"It would not necessanl\' be 
a student \\ ho fills 'the 
position. but we do have 
sl'\'cral proplc 10 the (I'nler 
\\ ho are interested in workmg 
the 20 hours. Of course, lIlt' 
coordmator Will be a woman." 

,\tkinson, however. stated 
I hat I her(, I,). a~ not much h 
could do nbout ' tlit' prohlem 

since it did not fall within his 
realm, 

"I hate to tell you this , I 
mean thi is the way these 
meet i ng go. You have alerted . 
me to the problem, but this is 
not the sort of orohlprn T r<> .... 
respond to. r assume it goe 
through Vice Chancellor Joe 
Watson's office," responded 
Atkinson. 

In spite of thIS, the WC 
member. were assured that 
somet hing would be done 
about their problem. 

Anot her issue brought up to 
Atkin~on'o.; attentIOn was the 
A proposal to remove beer 
from the TGs. Much 
discussion was devoted to this 
su bject since It IS one whIch 
dIrectly affects all students. 
Marc Geiger. AS commisioner 
of public relations, who is 
against the proposal, was 
present to \'oice hiS dissatis-
faction. 

"I personally do not think it 
IS a good Idea. The AS has 
already screwed enough 
students We s hould not 
change something the

Lisa Stenmark stated that 
the laws of the state and of the 
uni\'erslt\ should be adhered 
to. She' behe\ e:-; that the 
problem is due to the fact thaI 
TGs are synonymous with 
beer. 

"Tht're is t he hazard of 
people who check IDs bemg 
t hrea tcned and st tlden t s 
takmg cuts in line to get beer. 
It's a definite problt·m. I don 't

mood of the TGs should be 
ft'stl\e and not geared toward 
the beer.

TG or not TG: This 
is not the question! 

Most of us at UCSD are aware of the social value of AS· 
ponsored TGIFs. We stud y hard all week and deserve a 

chance to party with our friends and cia smates. The AS 
established TGs for thi purpose and doe~ not intend to 
cancel them. What is being debated is how we can 
maintain the festive atmosphere as well as obey the 
alcohol la\\' that we have hitherto been flagrantly 
\'iolating. 

Whether we like it or not, we are upagainst a numberof 
unyielding state law that prohibit most of the very 
practices we hold so dear. Among them: 
Serving Beer to Minors: Thi happens a lot at the TGS and 
it i illegal. The use of fake IDs is admitted by everyone to 
be the primary method for getting around the over·21 rule. 
Brute force i another troublesome, albeit Ie common 
method of obtaining beer. Two parties are liable for the e 
infractions - the drinking minor, you perhaps, and the 
spon~or organization, the A UCSD. Common. ense and 
UC in~urance guidelines dictate that this practice cease. 
The A IS \\'orking with the Alcoholic Beverage Control 
department (ARCD) and the registrar to figure out a better 
fD check s) stem If you're pissed about this sort of 
crackdown, tough beans. 
J\'ou·As spoJ/sured beer: Ever not ice how some people show 
up at a TG with bottles of Lowen hrau and t\1oosf'hrad? It' ~ 
illegal to bring ~our 0\\ n when the A '\ own is Ix'mg 
,ened. The AS is respon~ible for confiscatmg alcohol 
illegally brought on campus. Most p ople don't appreciate 
this precaution . This i~ a justifiable thing to get mad 
about. but the AS is obliged to preserve the sanct ity of 
their own beer - especially if the TGs themselves are 
endangered by "alien beer". People should know that 
when their beer and our beer get tog ther, havoc and the 
UC D IX)lice may result. 
/jabililv: If YOU end up in the morgue after an AS TG, we 
can be sued.\Ve don't want to be sued, nor does the lIeS}) 
administration. Even mdi"idual and institution ha ... the 
unalienable right to cover their a ... s. In debating the T(} 
lssue, I he .\S is not t rymg to be an t i·f un. W (' are tr:.:ing to 
assume a responsible attitude to\\'ard drinking on thi~ 
campus. All students should share t his concern.

Student Center in phase III 
Contin ued (rom page 5 

According to AS President 
Henry Chu the list of ideas for 
the new center ranged from a 
multi-purpose room and an 
arcade to the po sibility of 
offices and a bank. 

There are no firm sites, 
though . Watson mentioned 
that the project has a long way 
to go before they can talk in 
"concrete terms." 

The center is expected to be 
located near the existing 
center. But in terms of specific 
sites, design, and number of 
storie, no clear decisions have 
been made. 

Wat on feel that it is 
imperative that there be a very 
broad input, not only from the 
advisory committee but al 0 
from the student body in .. 

general. 

HI think we are in a 
part icularly good position this 
year to do the project," says 

Watso n. Given that everyone 
agrees and there is a positive 
student referendum vote, 
construction could begin in a 
year or so. 

CP&P needs rOOnl 
Continued from page 5 
which led to an ad-hoc building 
advisory committee. A new 
building was proposed for the 
Career Center, and a spot just 
north of the International 
Center was selected as the 
choice si te. 

Finally, the Career Center's 
proposals passed to the 
Registration Fee Committee 
for final approval. With the 
Regi stration Fee Committee's 
approval, the plans for the new 

CPPc will move into 
action. 

Many things must be done 
before building even begins: 
accepting bids for construc-
tion. approval of a site and 
awarding of various monies 
are only a few . However, with 
the proper approval. the 
Career Center can begin With 
its plans, and in the futurewill 
be able to offer all of it s 
'ervices to students from one 
larger, more efficient locatIOn_

Another little-known 
structure IS behtnd the 
Warren ReSidential Hall s. 
Here stands a two-floor, 
brown, wooden buiding, 
known as t he "Outback Cafe." 
According to the handpainted 
sign, it was fou nded In 1977. It 
was originally used as a 
st ud nt recreatIOn and lounge 
area, and had a small 
kitchenette hooth that sold 
candy and other goodies, thus 
explaining the use of the word 
cafe.

tentative plans for (he

expansion of the Student 
Center offices, but nothing 
definite has been announed 
yet. 

Ju st beyond the Outback 
Cafe, traveling on the UCSD 
Truck Route toward cnpps 
Hospital , lies the Biology 
Greenhouse complex. This 
consists of a small, main house 
and se\ eral small greenhouses 
in the area behind it. At one 
time this space was occupied 
by the US Department of 
Agri cu lture and their 
green houses. They were bu i It 
in 1962. 

In the early 70s, the USDA 
picked up their greenhouses 
and moved to headquarters in 
the Imperial Valley and UC D 
constructed its own green-
houses for biology field study.

reknowned botanisl who once 
worked for t he USDA and is

Is alcohol a busing people or vice versa? 
By COLIN TYUL 

The word abuse imparts a 
negative connotation to every 
word adjacent to it. ft is 
interesting that alcohol is 
as ociated with the word 
abuse. Alcohol long has been 
related to medicinal uses and 
criminal acts Before the 
discovery of hydrogen 
peroxide and betadine. alcohol 
wa, used a. an antiseptic and 
germicidal agent. Many 
criminal actions are performed 
under alcohol's influences. As 
anthropologists notice that 
Homo sapiens are the most 
socialized creatures. archae-
ologi ts surveys support this 
with their artifact collections. 

ociologists also discovered 
that thi species has a well 
developed attractive instinct 
toward the oppo ite sex; this is 
explained by p ychologist as 
Oedipus or electra complex 
and biologists as a differnence 
in chromo,omes. female with 
XX and male with XY. The 
result of the e complexitie i 
ummarized by mathema. 

tician as Malthu ian theory: 
population increase exponen.

Running Thoughts 
By MIKE GREENBERG and JEFF SAVAGE 

Slall \\ ritcr~ 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Five days ago. the 
Clippers' number one draft pick I erry L.ummlOg" l)eCarne the 
properly of Donald Sterling when he signed on the dotted line. 
With the addition of Cummings. an Diego should climb from 
the depth of disparity to the midst of mediocrity. igning the 
DePaul AII·American to a four vear contract was a sound move. 
and should a llow the Cli pper to be competitive within the 
league. All t he way around the table it sure looks like a good deal, 
but wit h Donald 1"s history of blunders, there has to be a catch. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. The UC 0 baseball team 
is goi ng to China. One would think the United States would 
prefer a powerhouse like Arizona State or USC representing 
them in the People' Republic. Instead, it will be Tnton blue and 
gold making history. A tip of the hat to Head Coach Lyle Yates 
and Athletic Director Judy Sweet for winging the deal. It IS well 
known that UC 0 excels in academics. but this major 
development proves that we have an at hletic program as well. 
Admini tration take note. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. Is the nited tates Football 
League going to be more powerful than even they had presumed ? 
Wit h the collapse of the NFL. a group of player represent alive;. 
met \0\ ith U . FL Commissioner Chet Simmons and expre!'N'd an 
interest in joining the newly founded league. Contracts run out 
next year for 25% of the NFL players. a nd when polled. ever\ one 
of t hem said t hey would join the I I FL if the opport unit} 
presented it"elf. The player:. will hear opportumty knock Ing 
when the NFL has been declared "offlcialh terminated .. With 
this recent de,'clopment, more pressure is 'put on both Sides to

World class athlete visits UCSD 
By TYNAN SCHMIDT 

Staff Writer 
The era of male-dominated 

a thletics has passed, and with 
the advent of the liberated 
woman, more and more 
females are getting physically 
into shape. Yet some women 
hesitate to venture into such a 
fi eld w h i ch has been 
considered non-feminine. For 
these women who are 
pondering the thought of 
getting exerci e, or even those 
that have already started , the 
word from female body builder 
and marathon runner Gayle 
Olinekova i "Go for it! " This 
i a lso the appropriate title of a 
new book by Olinekova, who 
appeared on campu last 
Friday on a promot ionaltour. 

Go /01' It' is a book which 
'answer!, the questions for 

women who want to get into 
hape. rt is also a motiva· 

tional book to get women 
interested in athletics. 

Olinekova is an extraord-
inary athlete. From her win as 
runner at the Junior 
Championship at age 16, toher 
book release 14 years later, 
Oliekova has spanned a 
lifetime of achievements. She 
is not only a marathon runner, 
but a champion cycl is t , c ross-
country skier, speed s kater, 
and even a world-class body 
builder. But w hat makes her 
a ll the more ex traordinary is 
that she sti ll looks like any 
ot her woman off the street. 
She is not brawny or full of 
bulging muscles. as are many 
mall' atheletes. he IS 
gracious, courteous and no! 

overbearing. When asked 
what is t he "woman" of th~ 
80's i like, Olinekova says, 
" Her body is functional yet 
leek and strong." ft is a if she 

i describing herself. And 
what abou t her femininity ? 
" Look , the only way your 
going to lose your femininity is 
on the operating table," she 
replies. 

Olinekova is a true model of 
what a woman athelet should 
be. She lifts weight to get in 
hape and for exerci e, a nd she 

feel men s hould not be 
intimidated by this because 
" Secure men are not 
intimidated ." he is now 
trying to share th se Idea~ 
wit h other women and get 
them into the \\orld of 
at hletlcs.

an o\'l'rall gameplan for the

Coach Doug J)annevlk said the 
team needed a win against 
l ISF, and at least a strong 
showing in Santa Clara before 
returning home. Things went 
t rue to form . Friday night in 
San Francisco, the Tritons 
jumped out to a quick two 
1,1(Ime lead, were denied a win 
momentari ly as the Dons won 
the third game. and went on to 
fini"h their busin ss in the 
fourth. The squad had their 
hest offensive performance of 
the year, hitting at a .333 clip. 
All· American Tammv Smit led 
the Tritons in t hat cal egory at

broke two school records. 
Playing in front of her family

qUIte a performance with an 
Incredible 27 kills, accounting 
for more t han half the team's 
point s, and she did 1l in 50 
attempts. Who needs a home 
court advantage? The game 

core~ were 15-4. 15·8.8- ]5.15·

<.;howing indeed. As the 15-1 1,

extremely close. In the fourth

ref uSing to surrender, came up 
wit h five pomts to cut t he lead

Seminar 
for safety 
and fitness 

A fitness and safety seminar 
for women will be held in the 
Canyon Room at University 
Towne Centre Saturday. 
November 13, from 10 to 11:30 
and from 12 noon to 1:30. 

Speakers at the seminar will 
be Bobbi Bennet t. ASbistant 
Director, Rape Emergency 
Assibtance League. and Anne 

chupack, National Women 's 
Self Defense Council. 

The purpose of the seminar 
is to introduce women to a new 
program called DEFE SE 
ERCl E. which combines th 
popularity in exercise wit h the 
need for women to guard 
against assaults and rapes. 

Bill Kelly, the founder and 
organizer of DEFENSE· 
ERCISE, sa id he want 
women to feel "free to do 
things alone." He s t ressed that 
the theme of the program is 
"Exercise Your Right To 
Protect Yourself." 

SD debuts 
in MISL 
continued from !lage 19 
franchis such as San Diego. 
However, many teams are 
looking at these " rookie" 

I team as just that - rookies 
who are Inexperienced and 
offer little or no competition. 
The leagues's schedule 
makers were not easy on the 
newcomers, and have pitted 

an Diego again t the M£SL's 
number one and two teams for 
their first matches. 

Friday's conquest was a big 
hurdle for the ockers . but 
tomorrow nigh l 's game w ill be 
a bigger one; not only 
competitively speaking bu-t 
also to see if their fans will 
bring last year's enthusiasm 
back to the Sports Arena . A 
longer season (48 games) and 
increased TV coverage 
(Channel 51 is televising 13 
road games) shou ld give the 
San Diegan the exposure they 
so desperately crave and 
deserve. 

Athletic 
funding 
continue d from page 20 
will allow coaches to put more 
energy into their teams, and 
thus get more energy out of 
them. Jt may also help reduc 
the attrition rate among 
coaches. Right now. noone can 
be blamed for leaving a 
coaching position here as soon 
as hegains enough expertise to 
land a bet ter job. 

The most important issues 
here are not only the 
discrepancy in salanes. but 
also the discrepancies that this 
in turn represents between the 
university's words and its 
deeds. 

£f this proposal does not 
pass, intercollegiate athletics 
would not perish. It would 
simply grit its teeth and 
mu s ter that much more 
fortitude. And while the 
rej ct ion of this proposal 
wou ld not dampen the spirits 
of the athletes and coaches, lt 
would mar the reputation of 
t he university wit hat (lint not 
asily denied: that thi s 
unJv~rsit y supports only 
superficially id('(lls wl11Ch it in 
no way Inl ends to support 
materiull) or I angibly

stre sing the importance for 
immediate action . 

Watson wrote back a month 
and a half later, telling Sweet 
that she needed to submit a 
formal proposal (something 
that might have done with a 
phone call). In his letter, 
Watson stated that he was 
familiar with the problem. "I 
understand that the minimum 
coachi ng sa lary at other 
colleges and univer itie is 
over $15,000 while our UCSD 
salary is less than $6,500. I am 
threfore supportive in 
principle of increases in 
salaries for our coaches." 

the affected team and total 
program in general. Thi , in 
the word of VCUA Joseph 
Wat on, is in line with 
UCSD's master plan . 
"According to our philosophy, 
a coach should come to UCSD 
for awhile then leave, " he 
says. 

The reason the administra· 
tion's philosphy clashes with 
that of th coaches is the idea 
that academic and athletics 
cannot go hand in hand. This 
philosophy stems from past 
administrations' reasoning 
that tudent life at UCSD is 25 
hour a week in the classroom. 
The head of the Physical 
Education Department 
Howard Hunt di agrees. 

((According to ourphilo-
sophy, a coach should come 
to UCSD for awhile and 
then leave. " 

Sweet pointed out in her 
reply a few days later that, 
"Although it is techinically 
true that UCSD coaches 
salaries are less than $6,500, 
the information I presented to 
you previously indicates that 
the current average salary is 
actually less than $2,000.' 

Becuase of their minimal 
salary, many coaches have 
said privately that they are 
going to leave. For a team to be 
succes ful, or in the least 
competitive, a strong liason 
mu t be present bet ween a 
coach and the players. Most 
coache stre s that this 
u ually takes a couple of year 
to develop. 

Many UCSD coaches in 
recent years have ju. t finished 
mtroducing themselve before 
finance forced them to wave 
goodbye. The men's basketball 
team has had 3 coaches in four 
year and ba eball ha had 
three coaches in two years. 
Other ports how similar 
patterns. 

The high turnover in the 
coaching staff result in a 
severe lack of continuity for 

"Student life can be enhanced 
with a sound athletic 
program." 

Skeptics argue that 
athletics would hamper the 
high standard of academics 
stressed here at UCSD. There 
is no evidence that this would 
occur. Although academics is, 
and should be, the most 
important aspect of this and 
any other university, chools 
like Notre Dame and Stanford 
have proven that a fine 
academic program can blend 
with a sound intercollegiate 
program. Ivy League schools 
have succe fully committed 
to athletics as well as 
academic excellence.

Kobayashi says they show 
little inclination to rectify the 
problem. 

"The Reg Fee committee is 
generally compri ed of 
tudents who don't care about 

Intercollegiate Athletics and 
would rather channel that 
money into other palce '." 

The most frightening 
pro pect for "tudent athlete is 
the Admim"tration's apathe-
tic attitude, not only toward 
the Athletic Department but 
towards the st udents interests
