Harvard Subsidizes 
Student Abortions 
CAMBRIDGE. Mass. -
Harvard University has sub-
sidized abortions for its stu-
dents for over a decade, a 
fact that was announced by a 
Harvard Crimsol1 columnist 
on Oct. 28. Each semester. 
University Health Service ' 
(UHS) requires that all stu-
dents pay a Health ervice 
Fee of $323. UHS officials 
said that Harvard pools this 
money into a budget, from 
which money is withdrawn to 
finance all students ' medical 
treatment at UHS faci lities. 
From this fund UHS provides 
$275 toward funding each 
ahortion procedure. tudents 
are expecled to pay the dif-
ference between UHS 's suh-
sidy and the actual cos t of 
the abortion. UHS officials 
said.

By Vincent Gragnani 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A. . ounci l voted last Wednesday 
night to approve the remaining item on the 

ni versity of alifornia Students 
ssociation's (U SA) dvocacy Agenda 

that calls for the uni versi ty administration to 
recognile TA unions. 

The t:Ounci l approved the agenda item 
wi th 13 memhers voting in favor of it , seven 
voting against it and one abstaining from the 
VOle. 

A.S. Vice President Ex ternal Kirk 
Matsuzaki said that he was pleased that 
almost tWO-lhirds of the councilmembers 
upported the item. 

"I thought the fact that the counci l over-
whelmi ngly approved Ithe iteml is a good 
sign for our A . . government ," Matsuzaki 
said. 

Mat~ulaki said many A.S. oflicers have 
ed ucated themselves on the issue in recent 
weeks, and he believes they have voted in 
accordance with what they have learned. 

"They came to realile that the graduate 
students' working condi tions are the under-
graduates' learning conditions," Matsuzaki 
sa id . 'That's what their decision reflectcd." 

A.S. President Joe Leventhal , who 
opposed the agenda item, said he felt the

Previously, Leventhal said he was 
against the item because he did not believe 
that TA unionization was an undergraduate 
issue . He also said he wa ' concerned about 
the questions brought up by the Graduate 
Student Association regarding the source of 
moncy for the increased employee benefits 
that unionization wou ld bring.

Puente Project 
Receives High Honors 
MENTORING: Program assi ts high chool and 
community college students in move to college level 
By Elaine Wong 
Staff Writer 

The Puente Proj ect, a Uni versi ty 
of Californ ia and Cali fo rni a 
Community C olleges program, 
rece i ved the Innovati ons in 
Ameri can Government Award last 
week . This award is given to pro-
gram s that arc innovati ve and 
effecti ve in improving the academ-
ic success of educationally under-
represented students. 

The Innovations in A meri can 
Government Award is funded hy 
the Ford Foundati on and adminis-
tered by the H arvard Uni versity 
Kennedy School of Government in 
partnership with the Council for 
Excellence in Govemment. 

The Puente Project combines 
teaching, counse ling and mentor-
ing, providing students with a 
focused and continuous academic 
program. 

The project was se lected from a 
field of 1,500 applicants. Along 
with the Puente Project, nine other 
programs recei ved the 199B 
awards. Each of the recipients will 
recei ve $100,000 grants. 

In 19B I. Felix Galaviz and 
Patric ia McGrath - faculty mem-
bers at Chabot College in Hayward, 
Calif. - founded the Puente 
Project. The mission of the pro-
gram was to increase the number of 
Mexican Ameri can and L atino 
community college students who 
transfer to four-year colleges and 
univer ities such as the Uni versi ty 
of Californ ia. 

Over the past 17 year, the 
Puente program, which is open to 

all students, has been deve loped at 
3 community colleges and 21 high 
schools th roughout California. 

Additi onall y, educators in 
Sweden, New Zea land, A ustralia, 
Canada and South A fr ica have 
requested information on th is pro-
gram . 

" In recognizing the su eces~ of 
the Puente Project, the Innovations 
program is poi nting the way for 
communit ies and ed ucators to 
bri ng about posi t i ve change," 
M cGrath , Puente Proj ect co-direc-
tor, said. 

In the Puente program, commu-
nity coll ege students work with 
Puente counselors and discuss plans 
for college and career opportun ities. 

Student or adult mentors also 
provide the community college stu -
dents with advice. Students in the 
program must take a two-year 
Engl ish course. Field trips are 
taken to college campuses and to 
pro fess ional workplaces, in an 
attempt to inspi re the students. 

Nearly half of all students in the 
Puente program transfer from com-
munity co lleges to four-year insti-
tuti ons like the Uni versi ty of 
Cali fornia, while only 7 percent of 
non-Puente students transfer to 
four-year institutions. 

The Puente Proj ect assists more 
than 7,000 new and re turning stu-
dents annually. Of these 7,000 stu-
dents, apprO)timately 5,500 stu-
dents attend com munity colleges 
and 1,500 are enrolled high chool.

SECURITY: 
Theft is common 
near residence areas 
Continued from page 1 
the UCSD Police Department, and 
that the department supports a 
proacti ve crime prevention uni t 
that works cl osely with commulll -
ty members to make UCSD a 
safer place. 

" Anyone can ask fo r the crime 
prevention officer and talk with 
him," UCSD Police Officer 
Stephanie Martinez said . 

11le crime prevention unit reg-
ularly gives presentations on top-
ics such as personal safety, vehi -
cle and residential security, offiee 
security and rape prevention. The 
unit also presents self-defense and 
personal-safety workshops and 
many other crime awareness pro-
grams throughout the year. 

The report also stated that cam-
pus residents should take their per-
sonal safety seriously because of 
the open nature of campus. 

The report stated that campus 
residents should be advised that all 
rooms and apartment doors should 
remain locked at all times because 
theft is the most common criminal 
problem in the resident i al areas, the 
report stated. 

"They occur in various places 
all over campus," M artinez said . 
"Some examples are vehicles bro-
ken into, or in libraries where 
backpacks were left unattended 
while the student went to go pick 
up a book and other places as 
well, such as housing areas." 

The report also ·tated th at 
UCSD stu dents and employees 
w ith substance abu se problems 

create a health and safety ri sk for 
themsel ves and for others. The 
UCSD campus has been designat-
ed "drug- free" and only under cer-
tain circumstances is the con-
sumption of alcohol permitted. 

Additi onally, the possession, 
sa le, manufacture or distribution 
of any controlled substance is ille-
gal under both state and federal 
laws. Such laws are enforced hy 
the UCSD Poli ce Department. 
Violators are subject to university 
disciplinary acti on, criminal pros-
ecution, lines and imprisonment. 

The section of the report that 
warns students about their sa fety 
and UCSD's disciplinary codes 
also appears in the quarterl y 
Schedule of Classes. 

" We wanted to pick a resource 
that all students would need to 
have in order to survive at UCSD, 
and the [Schedule of Classes] 
published every quarter is some-
thing that each and every LUdent 
must have and read," UCSD 
Police Detective Sergeant Robert 
Jones said. 

" Although not every tudent 
goes through the beginning pages, 
where it has safety tips for stu-
dems on crime prevention topics 
like rape, burglary, etc., at least it 
is an important resource that stu-
dents have and an important sec-
tion to go through," he continued. 

The report stated that the U C 
Police put a special emphasis on 
laws invo lving weapons, alcohol , 
drugs and narcoti cs. UCSD and 
other UC police offi cers have the 
authority and duty to conduct 
criminal inves ti gati ons, arres t 
possible suspec ts and prevent 
campus cnme. 

The report also details the 

The UCSD Guardian 

composi ti on of UCSD's police 
force . The UCS D personnel is 
composed of 27 sworn police oni -
cers t hat are arilled and possess 
the same authorit y under the law 
as do municipal police oflicers. 

" Basically, UCSD's police 
offi cers have the same duti es as 
pol ice onicers fro l11 Sun Diego 
[Police Department I." said Greg 
Runge, who is a UCSD student 
ami police dispatcher. 

Onicers patrol the campus 24 
hours each day, 365 days a year. 
Al so, the pol ice department 
employs 12 unarmed Residential 
Security Oflicers (RSOs), who 
patrol the student residential areas 
of campus during the evening 
hours. 

Runge said RSOs are not 
police oftl cers but security guards 
that work for the police depart -
ment and are paid by the UCSD 
Housing. 

Additi onally, 25 Community 
Service Ollieers (CSOs) prov ide 
escort services, lock-up bui Idings 
and assist in special security details 
and scheduled university events. 

"CSOs are students who are 
employed by the police depart-
ment to go to dances, games and 
do escort services," Runge said. 

Seven dispatchers also work in 
the department, taking calls and 
dispatching offi cers. The UCSD 
police department provides imme-
diate re 'ponse to all police, li re and 
med ical emergencies. Automobile' 
and bicycle accidents arc also han-
dled by the department. 

The report also stated that the 
police department 's detec ti ve 
bureau is responsible for handling 
all cri minal investi gations on the 
campus.

GSA president also 
spoke before council 
Continued from page 1 

The A .S. Council approved the 
other six items on the Advocacy 
Agenda Oct. 28. 

UCSA, a student advisory hoard 
to the UC Regents, organtzes annu-
al edu(;atlOnal .:ampaigns for stu-
dents. UCSA will center its annual 
campai gns around the entire ~.:ven 
points on the agenda. 

The agenda is subject to the 
approval or the A.S. Councils and 
Graduate Student A ssociations of 
each UC campus. 

Thi s year 's agenda consists of 
the following seven points: outreach 
to underrepresented minority stu-
dents in higher education; address-
ing the rising costs of the University 
of California; making the UC 
Regents more accountable to stu-
dents; the spending of California 
money on prisons instead of educa-
ti on; improv ing the methods of 
repay ing student loans; calling for a 
code of conduct to prevent clothing 
bearing the University of 
California's name from being manu-
factured in sweatshops; and calling 
for the r.:cognition of Academic 
Student Employees/United Auto 
Workers (ASElUAW) by adminis-
trations at all UC campuses. 

Several speakers on both sides 
of the issue of TA unioni zat ion 
spoke at the beg inning of 
Wednesday 's meeting. 

Graduate Student Associati on 
(GSA) President Katynk a M artin ez 
said that although the GSA has tra-
ditional ly taken a neutral stance on 
TA issues, it approved the enti re 

NEWS 3 

U SA agenda last week. 
M artinez said that (he GSA has 

taken a neutral stance on TA issues 
because it feels that the Association 
of Student Employeesl United Auto 
Workers (AS ElUAW) is better ahl.: 
to address the i ~sues of unionization. 

" We recognize them I the 
ASE/UAWJ as the only group that 
can address TA issues," she said. 

The GSA passed a resolution 
last year call ing upon Chancellor 
Dynes to recognize the ASEfU AW. 

Mark Warsl1aw, a graduate stu -
dent and TA in the department of 
phi 10 'ophy, said he questions the 
administration 's priorities. 

"Their prioriti es are in the 
wrong place," Warshaw said . " We 
need collecti ve bargaining to force 
them to do the righl thing." 

Panlilo M arquez, who is also a 
gmduate student, spoke against TA 
unionization. 

Marquez said that he believes 
the university has not yet analyzed

Taking a closer look, however, we

AMERICA FORGETS THE VALUE OF INDEPENDENCE 
COMMENTARY: 
Our hard-fought 
history reminds us to 
honor our veterans on 
their day 
By Brook Garrettson 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

On Nov. II our nation wi ll 
honor those Americans who sacri -
ficed their live ' for our freedom 
and way of life. 

Milli ons of men and women 
have served in the Armed Forces 
and courageously fought in wars 
with the seltless motivation that, 
even if they di e there, fUlure gener-
ations will li ve in liberty, prosperi-
ty. and independence. These men 
and women deserve our utmos t 
apprec iation and gratitude. 

Many of our so ldiers are sta-
tioned nearby and are on call 24 
hours a day, prepared for Ii fe-
threatening duty. Because they arc 
there, we can go about our lives as 
degree-pursuing universi ty students 
with the conlidence that our way of 
life will remain intact. This is a 
luxury that few other nations enjoy, 
and we should be thankful and vig-
ilant about preserving our security. 

The independence declared by 
the original 13 colonies nol only 
gave birth to a new nation but to a 
new kind of individual: Ameri can. 
From the hard-fought indepen-
dence of the new nation grew men 
and women who were independent 
as none before them. Our founding 
fathers pledged thei r lives, their 
fortunes and thei r honor to the 
United States or America. relying 
on Divi ne Providence for her pro-
tection. 

At the time of the American 
Revolution , my own family had 
been in the Colonies for 100 years. 
When I visited my family on the last 
fourth of July, my elderly grand-
mother presented an originaillaxen 
American tlag that had been passed 
down lo her. Its 13 hand- titched 
stars and battle stains were an emo-
tional testament to the pledge that 
my family made to the new nalion 
more than two centuries ago. 

July 4, 1776 would become a 
source of hope for many. The ener-
gy spread to break the chains of 

Mexico ... 
Australia 

tyranny everyw here. Shortly after 
the American Revolution, on July 
14, 1789 Parisia ns stormed the 
Basli lie and set into motion the 
French Revolut ion. 

In contrast to the destructive 
chaos that followed the revolut ions 
in Europe during th at time, 
Philadelphia wi tnessed the cremion 
or something entirely new - a 
Constitution that remains unpa ral-
leled in its simplicity and right-
eousness . Even today, emergi ng 
nalions model their constitut ions 
after our own. 

Our nation's fathers provided a 
framework solidl y based on the 
rule of law. individual rights, the 
guarantee of property and a com-
1110n American identity. It has since 
been up to successive generations 
to see that these principles reaffi rm 
their status as inalienable ri ghts. To 
do so. we must all pay a price. 

The price is self-sufficiency and 
acceptance or responsibility for 
one's own ac tions and fortunes. 
The price is making the most of an 
opportun ity but never expec ting 
anyth ing more than opportunil y. 
The price is to never depend on 
good will from earthly powers but 
solely from that of God. 

Individuals from around the 
world came to this country, wi lling 
to pay the price. Princes and di stin-
guished scholars made ends meet 
by driving taxi cabs and cleaning 
Iloors to earn the opportunity of 
becoming American. Children or 
wealthy families raked leaves and 
delivered newspapers to earn for 
themselves the honor of being 
American. The name -'American" 
became sy nonymous with "i nde-
pendent" and the young nation 
became the symbol of man's best 
qualities for the world to view. 

In its second century, the young 
nation sent the best of its young to 
save the world time and time again . 
Because America was free and 
independent. it was a beacon of 
hope for those in other lands that 
had lost their freedom . So long as 
every American retained the spirit 
of independence, America wou ld 
remain independent. 

This is the American spi rit that 
moti vated our veterans to ri sk and 
sacri lice thei r lives, to protect the 
freedom and independence of pre-

Our founding fathers 
pledged their lives, 
their fortunes and 
their honor to the 
United States of

Divine Providence 
for her protection. 
sent and future Americans. There 
was no question in an American as 
10 whelher or not he or she wou ld 
go IU war wi th the poss ibility or 
uying for continued American 
independence. 

However. omi nllus changes 
began abou t three decades ago. 
During Ihe I 960s. a generation was 
pe rsuaded to go ahout destroying 
the old. They were enliced by Ihe 
promise of increasing goods and 
services provided by a government 
that, instead of guarding opportuni -
ty, would hencerorth distribute 
opportunilY and privi lege in a "fair 
and just" manner. 

The governmenl ended up fOOL-
ing the bill for individual failure 
and ending selr-surticiency ror mil-
lions by providing an ever-growing 
array of "entitlemenls." Knowledge 
is the primary lOul of indcpen-
dence, but instead or being taught 
knowledge, school children and 
adu llS alike would be ~ubjec ted to 
political agitation in the classroom 
and by much of journalism, philan-
thropy and entertainment. 

We are the onl y nati on in the 
world that has taught ilself ~elf- re t ­
ribution whi Ie we shou ld have been 
celebraling America 's greatness. 
By the millions, Americans fed 
themselves the poisonous rruit and 
lost thei r independenn!. 

Thi s loss has led mainstream 
America to lose sight of Ihe va lue 

of independence, the'price that ded-
icated. courugeous Americans paid 
for wi th their blood and sweat. 
While federal cmployees enjoy 
yearly pay raises, our soldiers have 
gotten none since Ih Reagan era 
leaving most helow Ihe poverty 
line, according to former-marine 
Craig Burney. 

High tu rnover has ensued in our 
armed forces wi lh Ihe lack of ex pe-
ri cnced so ldiers laxing our ability 10 
defend America. Retraining costs 
far outweigh the savi ngs from the 
under-compensalion of our soldiers. 

Faced with the all-important job 
of defendi ng our great land. our 
so ld iers have to make do wi th 
aging and unrcliable equipment , 
lack of protection from malicious 
fon;cs, the threat of powerful hos-
lile militaries and 'l commander-in-
chi ef who, never risking hi s life in 
a uniform. sends our most dedi cat-
ed young soldiers to light under the 
command of foreign interest '. 

The military employs millions 
of people who perform their jobs 
all around the world day and ni ght. 
II must be understood that military 
service rcquires the highest profes-
sional standards to defend America 
and it must be accepted that Ihose 
who risk their lives daily in the line 
of dUly wi ll not be known for great 
humility. 

ReL:ently, the military has been 
hounded by a relentless lynch moh 
of feminist groups. gay ri ghts 
activists and lefti st tax -exempt 
think tanks. 

Career military professionals 
are not prepared or trained for the 
vicious ly personal and politicall y 
motivated attacks they have only 
relle nlly started receiving. They 
lack the means 10 defend against it 
and they do not deserve it. This has 
done irreparable damage to our 
nation's defense ,lIld must end. 

Even the honor of death in 
defending America has been sold to 
.the highest bidder by the president. 
Those who have never se rved in the 
American armed forces are bei ng 
buried in Arlington National 
Cemetery. The lack of appreciation 
and respect in thei r second-class 
ci ti zenship coupled with the 
domestic adversity that they face 
has many of our serviL:cmen and 
women asking whether it is worth 

ri sking their li ves for our country. 
Two thousand years ago the 

nation of Greece began Ireating it · 
militury in a similar manner. Shortly 
after. Greece was success ive ly 

. invaded and then raped and pillaged 
by ncighboring empi res unceasingly 
through World War II with the Nal.i 
invasion. never gaining the opportu-
nity to recover rromtheir mistake. 

America is liow governed by too 
many d 'ctcd onidals who have 
never tasted the enli vening surge or 
independence, having li ved oil the 
public purse all their lives. They are 
surrounded by appoinlees who 
share their passion for Ihe global-
izalion of America. Their ignorance 
of the value and nature of indepen -
dence is revealed when Ihcy dele-
gate overeignty to Ihe United 
Nmions. conclude global environ-
mental treaties or continue gutting 
our defense establ ishment. 

Few nations regard America 
with dispassionate neutrali ty. 
America elicits affeclion, admira-
tion , envy and hostilit y, but never 
indifference. Ameri ca must 
respond to affection. remai.n wor-
thy of admiration, teach se lr-surti -
L:icncy to the envious, and maintain 
a healthy fear in the hostile in order 
to retain independence as a nation. 

We have and will continue to 
depend on a military thai is com-
mined to helping America remain 
independent so that she may remain 
the success story in a globa l sea of 
failure. This cannot happen unless 
Americans restore their indepen-
dence as individuals. Our soldiers 
must keep the will to risk thei r lives 
for America. I:' they don' t and we 
become the target of aggressive 
action by a hoslile power, you and 
your loved ones would suffer dearly 
and the odds would be that our chil-
dren wou ld never again experience 
independence. 

This Veterans Day, join each 
olher in the military town of San 
Diego in appreciation of . the great 
sacri rice our servicemen and 
women have made for America and 
the ca lling to whieh they have 
served. Think of them when giving 
thanks for the stability we enjoy 
that allows us to pursue a univer 'i-
ty educati on.

As reported by UCSD police, a

a~ross it. According to the Hate 
Crime Identifi cation Checklist, 
the defacing , removal or destruc-

Also nOled by UCSD police, a

words considered offensive to 
pl.!rson~ of a speci fi c race/cthnici -

served students can succeed, that 
communities can make changes at 
the local level," Felix Galaviz, 
Puente Project co-director, said . 

[n the high school segment of 
the Puente program, students must 
participate in an accelerated 
English writing composition pro-
gram . Students are provided with 
academic cou nseling, and also 
recei ve mentori ng from a profes-
sional in their community. 

"At a time when Americans 
across the country are concerned 
ab ut the educational advancement 
of minority students. the Puente 
Project pro vides solid evidence that 
with innovative leadership, 
answers can be within our grasp," 
Dav id Gergen , editor at large of 
u.s. News alld World Reporr and 
chai rman o f the Inn ovation s

MEETING: 
Matsuzaki thinks 
approval is a big step 
Continued from page 3 
would be comple tely leveling con-
ditions campus wide." 

Prior to voting on the issue. 
Revelle Senior Senator Leila Niazi 
motioned to make the vote an open 
roll -call vote because not all mem-
bers of the A.S. Counci l were pre-
sent at the meeting. An open roll 
call would allow members to cast 
their vote unti I Friday. 

Niazi's motion was narrowly 
defeated. She said she did not 
understand why the motion failed . 

"They had no reason to oppose the 
motion," she said. '''They just wanted 
to get the issue out of the way." 

A.S . External's Campus Office 
Director Jodi Empol said she was 
pleased that the A.S. Council 
approved the agenda item. 

' 'I'm glad that there's been over-
whelming support," Empol said. 
"Now it 's up to us as the A.S. and 
UCSA to bring the issue back to 
our campus on a united UC front 
and really inform the students." 

Matsuzaki said that he believes 
the council's approval of the issue is 
a big step in the eventual recognition 
of TA unions by the administration. 
He said that he believes opponents 
of the issue have often tried to divide 
undergraduates and graduates. 

"I think that once they [the 
admini tration) realize that there's 
bi lateral support between undergrad-
uates and graduates, and once they 
realize the importance ofTAs in our 
education , then the university will 
have to cave in," Matsuzaki said. 

Matsul.aki added that if the TAs 
go on strike, studcnts should see 
such a move as an issue between 
students and the administration. 

"What 's really important, " 
Matsuzaki said , " is that we as 
undergraduates hold the un iversit y 
accountable, not the TAs." 

Leventhal said that although he 
thinks UCSA will work hard ror the 
recogni ti on or TA uni ons, he 
believes the uni ver ity wi ll onl y 
recognize the unions if politicians 
pn,:sMlrc the un iversi ty to do so. 

" I don't th ink the uni versity 
ever plans to recoglll Lc the unions," 
Leventhal said . "If the uni vcrslly 
recogniles unions, it will only be 
when pOliti cians step in and try to 
tcll the sYl>ll:m how they should 
be running their schools."

ow did you get your 
name? 

Ping stands for peace, 
and Yung stands ror forever. 
So I'orevcr peace. My sis-
ter's name is Anne, and in 
Chinl.!se. Ping and An ne is a 
phrasl.! that means peace 
and tranquillity. 

Why did you choose UCSD? 
I cho,c this college hecausl: it was a place where 

I cou ld cxperiem;e a lot of things. I knew the sym-
phony wasn't exc lu~ive to musIc Illaj()r~ . I knew that 
there were wind ensembles, or the La Jolla sympho-
ny, that I cou ld tryout and mayhe get into Ihecau~e 
I also play the French Horn I. 

Tennis -wise. I huped J cou ld play competit ively. 
Ilike the baltic. llike going out and giving my best. 
When it's on the line, it 's heller. Whcn there's pres-
sure, thcn that's great. That \ why we play thc gamc. 

r also got into the I.!ngineering program. I love 
the environmt:nl. and the area is hcautirul. The com-
munity with the heache~ arc great. I've cvcn surfcd, 
What Student Organizations are you 
involved In? 

Last year I had the opportunity to he presidl.!nt of 
the Triton Engineering Student CoulH.:i l, whir.:h diJ 
huge program, like D.E.C.aJ'., which is the Di~<.:i ­

[1line~ of Enginecring Carecr Fair. This lIlade 
enough money so we could have belt!.:r outreach 
projects for the yuung sludent~ in San Dicgo coun-
ty that we go out and tl.!m:h. 

We also have a coup le or llIentor~hip programs 
that werc started last year to h.::lp sUJlJlort studcnt& 
entering UCSD. I rcmcmocr how talking to facul ty 

aJvisor~ and ()t hcr~ i~ intimidating, so I thought it 
would be a good idea 10 have a pcer llIelliorship pro-
gram, in addition tu an indu~try Illcntorship program. 

There arc J whole ~lcw of engineeri ng societies. 
Ba, i<.:all y the Triton Engineering Student ound l is 
compri~ed of the 16 l:nginccring societil.!s 0 11 cal1l-

pu~. Each ~ociety has its own rocus, whether it's a 
li cld of study or cultural or gender basl:d. 

Our job is to 'ipeak for them, get them Illoney and 
gct them space on camJlus. That '~ very important 
because right now, proje"s are being built in Illy 
garage. We're always pushing lor space. This cam-
pus is very lalge, Hnd the profc~sors are often 
research focuseJ , sOllletime~ students get I ()~ t in the 
shuffl e. But it's getting much hell cr. 11 's our job to 
make the school know that thl: students arc here and 
are paying to learn. Doing project~ not only aid their 
education, hut support UCSD's naille. 

The National As~ociation or Engineering StuJCi1l 

oum:i l is where we focus on natiGn'll projel·ts. I'm 
on the steering commillee called project BEST. or 
the BrochUi c for Engineering Students of Tomorrow. 
A lot of students whose parents aren 't engineers, or 
whose high school isn't ne'lr a university, or some 
place that has a school of enginecring, leavc a lot of 
students without any information abuut what engi -
neers do. On this committee, we'vl.: made a brochure 
of rea l engi necrs and real people in academia. We 
asked them questions that give students a direction. 

[ also work in the Center for Magnetic Re~ording 
Research (CMRR) for Professor Talke. Hc runs the 
lab very well, likes the lab clean, likes people to d 
their work, and is always making sure we work with 
the newest technologies, which is impol1ant in this 
lield. This type of tedmology is fast paced. It 's fun 
because you' re doi ng stull that influences every Held. 

I do test ing on what happens on the inside of y ur 
compul er hard dri ve, which is where you store your 
inr rmation, like your ones and your zeros. Your hits 
and your. hytes. A hard dri ve is a great example of 
where mCl:hanical engineering mcrges with electrical 
engineering. We have to get your hi story papers saved 
as ones and leros, and that's where it happens. 

It 's i Illpurtant to know thc whole story. My 
re~earch is about what happens to your lap top or 
computer when you accidentally drop it. These arc 
medmnislllS that are very sensitive. We're dea ling 
with di stances that are less than wavelengths of light. 

What happens when you drop your lap top two 
inchcs when you're setting it down, or it fall s while 
being transported. Will your computer crash') Will 
you loose your IInal paper? How can this be pre-
vcnted? That's why [ see it as very influential work. 

This summer I was fortunate enough to work at 
IBM ; not Hewlett-Packard because my mom IVorh 
there and J IVant to do my own thi ng. I n the hard 
drives that IBM i, Icurrently] producing, there arc 
paris that were worked on by Illy group. It 's scary, 
bec;lusc th is is MulT that is influcncing all liclds. 
How hard is it to play for the tennis team? 

I'vc mellowed out a lot. I ju~t enjoy the game 
now. When I walk out on the court , J zone out and 
everything else i~ gone. 

Tennis is about gelli ng in shape and finding out 
how well you can balance your physical side and 
your mental ~ide together. Anger i, like fire, because 
it can pump you up hut can bc very dangerous. You 
want to stay even keel , but wi th hi gh intensi ty. That\ 
the balance of every thi ng. There's intensi ty, but you 
have to be aware. When yuu're angry and intense, 
thing~ move very quickly. You could loose or win 
quickly. That's the balance that has to he achieved 
am.! that i~ why you always have to be aware. 
What do you like least about UCSD? 

Student apathy when it comcs to Mudent athletics 
i~ huge. My voicc is hoarse all the lime screaming 
and yelling and leadi ng cheers. People should go to 
games because it is such a fun thing to do. Athletes 
don't get any rcrkl>, so they do it for the love of the 
game. Studcnts at other schools can't say that. 

Ath letes enj oy having people in the stands. II 
makes a hig difference. [When I was inl Dartmouth, 
and they won the Ivy Icague championShips in foot-
ball, no one sut. despi te zero degree temperature and

PSYCHO THERAPY 
The insensitivity of men knows no boundaries ... or so says Cosmo 

MARY HIGGINS 
Senior Staff Writer 

whine about exal:tly the same 
things (i.e. our l: lasses. our lal:k of 
money and our signifkant others). 

Now let us examine how I fell as 
chucked the glossy publication 

into my garbage l:an after I linished 
reading it. 

I think my sentimenl at the time 
was: "Men are selfish, arrogant, 
l:Onniving sex-mongers !" 

How could I think otherwise 
when the anonymous author made 
assertions like. "The bull hippo, for 
example, gelS horny, sniffs around 

be true after all? What if guys were 
m:tually heartless jerks'l What if my 
guy fri ends just happen 10 he sensi-
tive, When-Harry- Mel -Sally-
watdling freaks of nalure'! 

I decided to do my own 
research. You may remember Ihis 
was a topic of concern last week; I 
asked you male readers 10 write to 
me in defense of yourselves. 

Needless to say, I rel:eived a full 
array of responses. 

"I am an insensitive dod," wrote 
in one male reader. 

readers : I am not l: )aiming that 
women have the monopoly on sen-
sitivity ... I know plenty of fcmalc 
hippos.) 

Mostl I was hoping for some 
evidenl:e that the COSIIIO artide was 
wrilten by just one shallow guy 
who in no way represents the entire 
male kingdom. 

I spent half a week in total 
despair. 

And then I got e·mail from a 
Sensitive Guy (from here on 
referred to as SG) who wanted to 

I was reading Cosmo the other 
day (yeah, I watch "Days of Our 
Lives" too ... call me girlie) and I 
nOlil:ed something interesting. 
Fashion magazines usually portray 
women as savvy, successful and 
powerful, yet co nstantly belea-
guered by men who are seltish, 
arrogant. conni ving sex-mongers. 

I came to this Earth-shattering 
conclusion while I waited in line at 
the grocery store and skimmed 
through an article (written by an 
anonymous guy) titled : "JUSI 
Because I Slept With You Doesn' t 
Mean I' m Your Boyfriend ," 

Just Because I Slept With You Doesn 't Mean I'm 
Your Boyfriend. " A numbing sensation slid over 
me like ice cubes down the back of my shirt. I 

thought to myself, Jeez, maybe juan, jeff Pedro, 
Sven, j ean-Philippe and Chaz aren 't really in love 

with me ajter all.!" 
A numbing sensation slid over 

me Jike ice l:ubes down the back of 
my shirt . I thought to myself. "Jeez. 
maybe Juan . Jeff. Pedro, Sven. 
Jean ·Philippe and Chaz aren't rea l-
ly in love wilh me after all!" 

I knew I had to buy thi s "Spel: ial 
College Issue" of C OSIIIO at once. 

Lct's backtrac k a moment and 
ex plore my state of mind beforc J 
pkkcd up the magazine. I' ve 
always hought into the theory thai 
deep down men and women are 
essentially similar creatures: co n· 
fused. pass ionate and well-mcan· 
ing. This belier is based on the fact 
Ihat my guy fri ends are usually a 
lot like me .. . we spend hours on 
the phone togcther and we always 

unti I he linds a fetching femltle, 
and then stands up on hi s hind legs 
10 make love ... Males of the human 
spel:ies are like that too." 

No wonder the author didn ' l 
want to take Ihe credit. What kind 
of an idiot compures his love-mak-
ing skills to Ihose of a hippo'! 

He further wro te thut mcn arc 
"quite capahle of the phys ical pu rt 
bUI totall y unable to handle Ihe 
emotional side ... Generall y, we 
know Ihat we want yo ur body, hut 
we just arcn' t sure that we want 
you." 

Sadly, all it took was onc stupi d 
art ide in C OSIIIO to scnd me inlO u 
full ·blown panic. What if the 
stereotype about men turncd out to

"Womcn Ihink guys are all 
about helching and farting:' thc 
ncxt guy wrote. "Well OK. may be 
thai w nsists of aboul 90 perce nt of 
our li ves, hut the other I 0 fJI.~n: e nt i ~ 
other things." 

T.:n percent Isn ' t so had. J rea~­
sured myscl f. I Gill deal wi lh a guy 
who is ~.: ns iti vc onl y JO pcrl:.:nt of 
Ihe time. 

But who was I (."i dding'l A 1)0 
pcrcent farl fal:IOr" That '5 a lot or 
melhane. 

I guess what I was reall y look· 
ing for from you hippos ... er. I 
mean men ... was an explanation 
for your behavior. Maybe ~omc 
self·analysis or what make~ you 
different from the l adi c~. ( ote 10 

give mc an "appropriate insight 
inlo one man's heart and mind." . 

Without going into Ihe dctails of 
what he wrote, I will tell you this 
- il fl oo rcd mc. I couldn ' t bc licve 
Ihal anyone would take the time 
and t.: lro rt 10 wri te me a page and a 
ha lf ahoul hi s personal ph ilosophy. 

I loY<: ev.: ry single e·mail I gel 
fro m you guys (including the oncs 
Ihal lell me I stink). but Ihe notc 
rrom SG rcally took mc by sur· 
pri sc. 

I printed it out and took it home 
with me. I read it again , I thought 
about it some more. I was 
intrigued. SG providcd me wilh 
evidem:e Ihat Ihere arc men oul 
Ihcre who huve morc sophisti l:<llCd 

manners than those whil:h you 
mighl see on the "Wild. Wild World 
of Animals." 

But again I had doubls; perhaps 
S.G. was an oddi ty like my guy 
pals. 

I tigured at the very least S.G. 
was a literature major who was 
used to spouting off verses of poet· 
ry. I e·mailed him bal:k to ask if he 
thought he was like most guys. or if 
he thought he was an exception. 

SG wrote back, "There are men 
like me who allow thcmsclvcs a few 
moments of freedom from life and 
society 'S expel:talions. but the 
majority of men are ei ther 100 afraid 
to let go or don'l know how. Some· 
limes you l:an see the masks l:ome 
off both men and women. Some· 
times il 's just a smile or a laugh, or 
even a look .. . Everyone is different 
in the ways they express themselves. 
bUI all that matters is that Lhey do." 

And Ihere was my answer.

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 
Change of address (and jury duty) isn't all fun and games 

DAVE LUBITZ 
Pho/n t.Clitnr 

A lot of college ~tudents lead 
nomadic lives. in some ways very 
similar to the ancient wanderings 
of our distant ancestors. In~tead of 
following migrating caribou herds 
or moving livestock to beller graz-
ing. collegiale nomads move 
bel ween classes and summer jobs, 
friends and family dispersed acros, 
the nation, or even the globe. Whi Ie 
the territory may be rather va~t , and 
the hunt for a meal no longer is the 
driving reason. Ihe transienl nature 
of college life isn' t Ihal differenl 
from the past. 

It is Ihe lemporary nalure of col-
lege Ihal di 'courages people from 
pUlling down roots. Quaners lasl 
10 wceks. During the holidays, a 
general exodus occurs a~ ,tudenl, 
migrale to visit family, lake shon-
term jobs or have no real purpose, 
other then to just Iravel. I once 
wandered through Price Cenler on 
Thanksgiving Day. wondering if 
I'd missed the evacuation order. 
People ju. t don 't stay on thi s I.:am-
pus when classes end. 

Because of this transiem;e. the 
registrar's office asks for two 
addresses for each ·tudent : a 

"school" address and a "perma-
nent" one. But even this isn' t really 
su flicient. Witness the annual 
"housi ng dash." 

Every year in August and Sep-
tember, herds of collegiate nomads 
Sl:OU r the local area searching for 
new dwelling places as their old 
friends and roommates corne and 
go. After four years al UCSD, I am 
proud to say that I have linally 
managed to get all of my appropri-
ate addresses correct, and on Ii Ie. 
with the registrar'S o fli I.!e. Though 
temporary. thi s ranks as one of my 
greatest accomplishments at 
UC D. ot that this situation will 
last for long. 

Ask yourself: How many times 
have you changed addresses during 
yuur lenure as a w llege student? Or 
been "bet ween addresses," ~ urli ng 
from one friend 's couch tn another 
while you searched for a place to 
live without signi ng a yearlong 
lease. Ever had problem~ hecause 
the UC Regent ~ , fami Iy or a gov-
enunent agency couldn ' t keep up 
wi th your address hopping'! 

Modern technology helps make 
Ihis lifestyle feasible. if not practi -
cal. As it becollles cheaper and eas-
ier to travel. people arc more likely 
to travel ral1her and farther afi eld. 
JUSI jump in the car and go. And 
si nce you lravel around in Ihat car 
so much. why not just move into 11" 
The lIlevitabll.! explanatIOn for Ihe 
landfill-like nature inside most stu-
deOl 's vehides: " I live in my car." 

This whole situation is caused 
by the struclure of life at this insti-

Just check the 
appropriate excuse 
and send It In week 
before the assigned 
date. Oops, missed 
that deadline too. 
With no other 
avenues, I called 
the information 
number on my 
notice, figuring I 
could just explain 
the whole situation, 
come to some kind 
of agreement with 
the Justice 
Department, and 
avoid sharing a jail 
cell with convicted 
jaywalkers, 17-year-
old curfew breakers, 
and other evil doers 
with no respect for 
the law. 
lution. ow, I uon ' t rcall y mind the 
nomadic libtyk. iI " ddinitel y 
good lor a laugh. BUI I'm ~till 
gOing to hlame the unlver~ily for 
any prohlem~ that ari~e 1'1'0111 it. 

Example: Recently. the Justi ce 
Department decided thaI it was 

time for me to fulfill my civic duty 
and serve on a jury. II duly mailed 
out a summons telling me when 
and where I was to report, and 
blindly assumed that I was now 
informed or its wishes. Unfortu-
nately, the department did this in 
the middle or the summer. when I 
wasn't in California. It also sent Ihe 
uoti ce to an address where I hadn 't 
liVl.!d in over two years. Needless to 
~ay, hy the time I held the summons 
in my hands, I had already missed 
my reponing day by three weeks. 

I also found OUI that I had COI11-
mitted a grievous cri me punishable 
by tille~ andjail time. I'd fail ed to 
report ror my "civic duty." This 
caused me a certain amount of COIl -
cern. The nOlice explained in great 
tietai I all the possible consequences 
of rai ling to report. I could basical-
ly [OUIlt on being blacklisted by all 
levels of Ihe U.S. government. 

I found my~elr wondering how 
~uch an odd ~itua ti ()n had ari~en . 
There is no law that requires you to 

en~ure that you receive all mail sent 
10 YOll . The Postal Service isn't at 
fault; they just sen t Ihe summons to 
the address on i I. I f the J lIstiee 
Department can charge people who 
don't show up for jury uuty. then il 
should at least semi summons by 
regiMered mail to ensure that the 
addre~sccs receive them. 

The Ju,ticc Departmenl had 
at:tually l:ndoseu a wnvenient 
"cxt:use" form . Ju , t check the 
appropriate excuse, and send it in a 
week hefore the assigned date. 
Oops, missed that deadline too. 

With no other avenues, I called the 
information number on my notice, 
figuring I could just explain the 
whole situation, corne to some kind 
of agreement with the Justice 
Department, and avoid sharing a 
jail cell with convicted jaywalkers, 
17-year-old curfew breakers, and 
other evil doers with no respect for 
the law. 

I never did get to explain 
myself. An automated system 
answered the phone, and never 
gavc me Ihe option of talking to a 
real person. The number was basi -
ca ll y a telephone version of the 
excuse form . I spoke at th appro-
priate times, and it recorded my 
voice, presumably 10 allow some-
one to be able to handle my case 
without actually having to interact 
with me. l still don 't know when or 
if I' m go ing 10 have jury duty, jail 
timc or both. As far as I cou ld tell, 
they're going to send out a new 
nOlice for me ... probably to the 
same place then sent the last one. 

I Sli ppose there's no reason 10 
worry. If the depanment can't even 
get a leiter mailed to me, it proba-
hly couldn't lind me either. If they 
necd me to be judgmental badly 
enough, the dcpar1ment will find 
me. 

Anyway, the whole thing is sti ll 
SO's fault. or course. I don ' t 

real ly have lillle to spend a week 
~crving on a jury anyway. So 
maybe I shouldn't complain 100 
mut:h. eh? Hmmlll ... actually, just 
forgcl everything [' ve said. Li re 
isn't so had .. .

"I th ink the resu lts turned out

election was one where, for 
the most part, I was actually 
fighting wi lh the notion where 
there were two decent

"I voted Democratic, so it was

" I think a lot of people voted,

were voting on. A lot of 
propaganda. You know how 
Sea World had that one do ll ar

handed out all those nyers

books behind and show some school

we need more people to show up and 
get a taste of how exciting it is. 
How do you find NIMC.? 

I start the day otl' preLly early. I'm 
lucky because I don 't need much 
sleep. My best days arc when I begin 
with yoga. It sets the day up. and is a 
very peaceful thing. I've been doing 
it for two years through the recre-
ation classes and it 's a lot of fun. 

Basically my day is classes and 
doing research at the CMRR. We 
just had a research review that went 
very we ll. Tennis takes up a block of 
time in the afternoon. The night is 
for studying, or going out. 

lt 's important to schedule in eat-
ing and sleeping. It sounds ridicu-

lou~, but a lot of people on this cam-
pus arc so busy that they forget to eat. 

The mo~t important thing is to 
schedule time for yourself. A lot of 
people on this campus give a lot of 
themselves to the community and to 
their peers. It's important to schedule 
time for yourself. TIlat's why yoga's 
i mponant. You just sit, and ju ,t he. 

Yoga entails a lot of stretching 
and breathing and balancing. It \ 
kind of analogous to time manage-
ment, which is about balance. 
Who .re your heroes, or who 
h •• Influenced you the most? 

My parents. They arc so hard 
working. My fri ends. Everything that 
I love about UCSD are the students 
giving of themselves for the commu-
nity, whether they are doi ng the new 
buddy program, or commuter coun-
cil. wanting to be a teacher, or work-
ing at their parenL~ grocery store to 
help oul. That stull Ii res me up. That 
makes me wake up early in the mom-
ing, and get the day started, and to do 
everything with quali ty.

and then went back and met my 
mom. They came here in the 70's,

My mom started working in this

working as a magnetic tape check -

years ago, she started working with 
Ihi s company called Hewlett-

the HP branches in Europe and

mom is cool. My dad has hi s own

thing intensely, and believe very 
strongly in giving back to the com-
munity because two of my friends , 
Shelley and Amanda, passed away 
in car accidents. I think about it 
every so oft en. and that 's one thing 
that my parents don't know. 

And then Mr. Riches, our school 
principal, battled brain cancer, was 
only supposed to live a few months, 
but went on to live years through the 
love and support from his famil y 
and school. 

Why do they die when they were 
such wonderful people" I became 
dis illusioned. Now, I get my 
strength from knowing that anything 
can happen. Why not have fun , and 
do everything with passion'! I think 
about my fri ends and family who 
have lost this chance. [That'sJ when 
I think that now is when I need LO 
give it everything I've gOI. 

I keep a diary to track how my 
values have changed. I've learned

you have to live like today might be 
the best day of your life.

box. But goa lkeeper Jennifer 
Het land had already come out to

The UCSD Guardian 

As Beggln, 
Alfredson and 
Hetland all came 
together, the ball 
ricocheted away 
and toward the net, 
falling just inside 
the left posto The 
goal was a dagger 
into the hearts of 
the Triton players 
and fans alikeo 
UCSD's whole 
season now 
seemed very much 
in jeopardyo 
the Tritons to gain the cqualil.er, 
but the re~ult was the same. The 
ball kept going wide or right into 
the goa li l.:'s hands. It ~i mply was 
not to be. A~ the duck finally ran 

out, it was hard to comprehend 
what had just happened. The 
UCSD women's soccer dynasty or 
the past three years had ended in 
the lirst round. 

Words cannot describe the feel-
ings of misfortune that were fe lt 
by the players after the loss. The 
players just couldn't understand 
what happened - bad luck 
sceilled to be the onl y explanati on. 

"We were just unlucky, re;\ lly 
unluck ," junior midllelder Angie 
Mann said . "We kept missing 
goals by inches." 

Alrredson tried to make sense 
or the lone goal. 

"I can't rea lly understand it," 
she said. "We were just control -
ling the hall so much, but when we 
wcnt to sleep for a second , they 
had the breakaway." 

The se nsc that the Tritons were 
somehow cheated secmed to 

~pread through the team. Losing 
wa!> just never an option in th ir 
minds . 

"We left everything we had on 
that licld yesterday," cu-captain 

SPORTS 15 

Harispe said. "\ don't know what 
else we could have done. The gods 
were just against us th is time." 

So instead of the 51. Benedict 
match being a small hurdle for the 
Tritons before a toogh matchup 
wit h undefeated Wi lI amelle 
Col lege (OR) on Sunday, it was a 
sudden end to a great season. 

In the other regional matches, 
Willametle beat University of 
Wist.:onsi n- tevens Point before 
the UCSD gaille on Saturday, and 
last night defeated the Blazers 2- 1 
in sudden-death overtimc to 
extend their record to 18-0-4 and 
to earn a trip to the National 
Quarterlinals. 

The Tri tons ended their season 
with a record of 12-3-1. The good 
news for Head Coach Bri an 
McManus is that on ly Thiele and 
Hurlcy wi ll he graduating thi s 
year. The freshmen and s pho-
mores wil l all be back next year 
with more experien 'e under their 
belt . They will comprise the 
nucleus of a Triton squad hungry 
tu start a new winning tradition.

The Wild Ride Ends 
COASTER: UCSD can't pull off season-ending upset 
By Travis Hili 
Associate Sports Editor 

It 's been "Mr. Annslrong's Wild Ride." 
With wobbly legs and dizzy heads, Head 

Coach Derek Armstrong 's UCSD 
men 's soccer team has finally 
cnded its roller coaster ride of 
a season. True to form, the last 
Iwo games of the season for 
UCSD were up and down, as 
the team defeated Division 11/ rival 
Pomona-Pitzer College, 1-0 in over-
lime, then fell to Division I Cal State 
Northridge, 3-1 . 

Last Wednesday night. the Tritons trav-
eled to Pomona-Pilzer for a tussle with the 
Sagehens. UCSD had already been knocked 
out of postseason contention, but it was a 
whale of a game, as both sides played unbe-
lievable defense. The Tritons were forced to 
go with a makeshift lineup. as midlielder 
Cameron Adams. defender Bret Munson 
and forward Anthony Funicello were all still 
on the bench with red cards. Sweeper John 
Brandon did not start the match, but he 
would enter the game later. 

Future stars Jamie Lutlon, Jo hua Davis, 
Joshua Figgs, Mike Sanders and Daniel 
Appel all played very well for Armstrong, 
and the Tritons found themselves in a dog-
fight. Neither team cou Id score. 

Ninety minutes was not enough time so 
it was on to sudden death overlime. 
Armstrong had substituted Brandon earlier 
in the match for forward Sean Salinas. but 
Salinas came on again and scored the game-
winning goal for the Tritons. 

It was a great win for the Tritons, who 
took that mumentum with them for their 
match last Saturday night at Northridge. As 
the women's soccer team endured possibly 

the biggest upset in its history as it was 
knocked out of the playo ffs by unrank ed 
College of SI. Benedict. the men 's team 
almost pulled it off against the Matadors. 

Although it didn ' t look thut way 
early. as UCSD allowed goul s in 

the 22nd and 34th minutes. But 
the second score awoke. the 
Tritons, who came alive, net-
ting a goal in the 37th minute. 

. Brady Bernard. the leader of the 
Triton offense, converted a free 

kick from Shanne Sleder and UCSD 
began to put serious pressure on CSUN. 

As UCSD went into halftime, it felt con-
fidenl. The Tritons were down 2- 1, but scor-
ing again was by no means an impossible 
task. They came out in the sel:ond half with 
the momentum and continued to apply pres-
sure. Yet they could not not make it happen. 

"At the half we were in it." Brandon 
said. "We played with them for most of the 
second half, too." 

This match was Brandon's last game as a 
Triton, and Armstrong let him play up front 
for the occasion. Not surpri si ngly, the co-
captain performed ex tremely well . 

Still, the Tritons could not keep up with 
their Division I opposition. The Matadors 
added a late insurance goal to make it 3- 1, 
making UCSD's final reco rd 9-8- 1. 

It was definitely a roll er coaster ride of a 
season. Although U SD didn't make thc 
playoffs for the first time in years, the play-
ers kept their spirits up. 

Brandon spoke grace full y ahout hi s 
career as a Triton and hi s las t season in the 
gold and blue. 

"I' m not retiring from the ga me." he 
mused. "I'm just graduating from co llege. 
I'll miss those guys. It was a bias\."

Tough Losses Hurt 
FRUSTRATION: UCSD loses to UCLA and Pepperdine 
By Travis Hili 
Associate Sports Editor 

AAA HHHHRRRRRRGGGGGG I I II 

Going into the founh stanza, UCSD had 
the momentum and were in striking dis-
tance, down 11 -8. But the Bruins had a little 
bit more left in their tanks, and their offense

National Champion 
women's SOCl:er squad 
was upset at home by an 
unranked team in the first 
round of the NCAA playoffs. and 
the men's soccer team ended its di sap-
pointing season with a loss to Cal State 
Northridge. The No. 10 men's water polo 
team added to the frustration, recording a 
painful 16· 11 loss at UCLA on Friday and 
an even tougher one, 12-4, at home against 
Pepperdine yesterday. 

The Tritons traveled to West Los 
Angeles to open their weekend against the 
Bruins in UC LA's Sunset Rel:reation 
Center. UCLA is ranked No. 2 in the nation 
and is perennially one of the top teams in 
the country. But the Tritons have had the 
look of a giant-ki IIer all season long, w m-
ing within a hair's length of upsets over No. 
I USC and No. 8 Long BCilch State. 

Head Coach Denny Harper 's troops 
came out Ilat. however, and the Bruins 
ral:ed to a 4-0 lead at the end of the first 
quarter. They continued their domination in 
the second quarter and by the half UCSD 
was down, 9-1. 

It looked like the rout was on, but the 
Tritons answered the call in the third quar-
ter. With Doug Cole, Ross Mecham and 
Jal:ub Maze li s leading the charge, the 
Tritons l!xploded for 7 goals in the third, 
including a miraculou ' half-court, two-

period . 

away. 
. UCSD could only 
come up wilh three 

points and the match linished 
at 16-11.11 was a wild one, as UCSD 

had the mighty Bruins on the ropes, but 
w uldn 't deliver the knockout punch. 

Cole finished with 3 goals, Mecham had 
3 points on 2 goals, Mazelis had a two-
poi nter, and Gordon Beh, Vladimir Djapic 
and lustin Wylie each notched a goa l. 

UCSD went hack to La Jolla with a very 
familiar cliche bouncing painfully around 
its head: coulda, woulda, shoulda. The 
Tritons have been able to beal the top-
ranked teams they have been bauling. Every 
game has been a war, and the Tritons have 
come up just a bit short every time. That is 
the kind of feeling that can really begin to 
affec t a team 's performance; that is exactly 
what happened on Sunday. 

The Tritons took the pool against the 
Waves of Pepperdine and got swept away, 
12-4. Sunday was the last regular season 
game for the Tritons, their last tune-up 
before the postseason. The mentally -
r'lligued Tritons si mply let their guard down 
in a very forgettable performance. 

Now the Tritons must regroup and refo-

No.4 Tritons to Host NCAA West Regionals 
WINNING: UCSD will play winner of WillamettelLinfied match in 2nd round on Friday at 7 p.m. in RIMAe Arena 
By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

It wasn ' t the best weekend to be 
a Triton fan. The three-time 
defending National Champion 
women 's soccer team domi-
nated SI. Benedi ct's all 
night, but fe ll 
1-0 10 the 
Blazers after a 
nuke defensive 
breakdown. The men 's 
waterpolo team lost, twice. But 
alas, there were some bright 
moments for the Triton fan that 
came fro m the likes of UCSD's 
women 's volleyball team. 

Though luck didn ' t side with 
the Tritons at home, life was 
brighter for UCSD on the road . On 
Saturday night. the vo ll eyba ll 
women were in Orange, fini shing 
up their 1998 regular season cam-
paign; their dessert for the evening 
was Occidental College. 

"Pleased" may have been an 
understatement. McFarland played 
all 13 of his healthy players, and II 
of those athletes had at least one 
kill . 

One of those players was 
middle blocker Jen 

McLain . 
McLai n had a 
great outing, 

as she was one or 
three Tritons who had 7 

kill ' . Four of those kill s came 
in game two. 

"len McLain had a really good 
ga me for us," Ml:Farland said. 
"She was perfcct in game two, wi th 
1.000 percent hill ing percentage." 

Another Triton who stepped it 
up Saturday night against the 
Tigers was freshman middle-block-
er Katie Vater. Like McLain . Vater 
was also perfec t in game two. 

Earlier in the season the Tritons 
feasted on the Tigers in three 
games. 15- 1, 15 -2. 15-1. On 
Saturday, the final course was no 
different when the Tritons satisfied 
their appetite with another win. 
The team swept, 15-4, 15-4. 15-6, 
in UCSD's 21 st three-game win of 
the season. 

"Katie had a real good game hit-
ting-wise." McFarland said . "She 
was 5-5 in game two." 

Overall , the Tritons were 86-43 
on the allack and eomm illed onl y 
15 hilling errors. 

Lisa Huff/ Guardian 
Slap It: Senior Katherine Brynjestad smacks a kill past Westmont blockers. The Tritons beat Westmont 
at RIMAe on Wednesday, then ended their regular season with a win at Occidental on Saturday. 

Just as it was in the first 
matchup of the season. the lutest 
Occidental win came with case to 
the Tritons. 

"1 was pleased wi th the way we 
played:' Head Coac h Duncan 
McFarland said.

But volleyball is not just a game 
of hilling. There is a softer side -
selling. Three different Tritons -
junior Christine Kueneman. senior 
Dana Suiter and freshman Donn.1 
Tripiano - shared their soft tou~h 
on the ball . 

Kueneman , UCSD' leaJing 
seller wi th 8R7 assists thi s season, 
opened up gllme one wi tl II 
assists. Salter took over qUirter-
backing in game two and slowed 

great results with 14 assists. In 
game three, McFarland substituted 
Tripiano. and the rookie seller per-
formed like a veteran, dishing up 
16 assists. 

"Donna ran a good offense in 
game three," Md"arland said. 

So many players performi ng 
well at this point in the season 
makes McFarland'!. job even mure

postseason. As an NCAA rule, a

McFarland carries a 16-membcr 
roster, however. Things might get a

hampionship coach when he has 
to make a decision on 16 equally

However, McFarland says he 
is n't too cum;erned with his

just pleased with Saturday 's perfor-

"We w<l l1led to play well and 

use the rnat L: h as training for the 
playoffs," McFarland said. "And 
we were unsure abou t the competi-
tion. But we got something good 
out or it." 

If there is one thing the Tritons 
got from Saturday 's match, it was a 
plate full or conridence. They will 
have a week to prepare for this
