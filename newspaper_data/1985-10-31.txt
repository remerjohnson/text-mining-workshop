Job fair features 
prominent finns 

Representatives from over fony 
high-technology organizations 
will meet students at an 
engineering and sciences job fair 
on Friday, ovember I Inside

the Scripps Clinic and Research 
Center will be present. 

"Y ou don't necessarily have to 
be looking for a job to attend the 
fair ," said Maxine Bailey, 
associate director of Career 
Services. The fair will give 
students the chance to meet 
contacts that may lead to 
placement in summer jobs 
according to Bailey, but the 
central focus of the fair will be 
career placement.

students an opponunity to make 
contacts."

Career Services Center takes 
place from 10:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m. 
and admission is free. 

AP credit to 
be reviewed 

For a number of years the 
university has granted credit for 
completion of the College Board 
Advanced Placement (AP) 
examinations with scores of 
three, four or five . Students who 
have achieved these scores have 
recei ved on average five to 10 
credits toward the baccalaureate 
degree. 

The Board of Admissions and 
Relations with Schools (BOARS) 

has recently expressed concern 
about the amount of credit 
granted and the minimum score 
level accepted by the university 
for these tests, In panicular, 
BOARS is interested in reviewing 
the way in which the credit is 
used by each of the university 
campuses to waive breadth or 
depanmental requirements. 

BOARS has expressed interest 
in receiving comments and 
suggestions from high schools on 
the university's AP credit, policv. 
School officials should forward 
their suggestions to Carla Ferri , 
Admissions and Outreach 
:iervices, 317 University Hall , UC 
Berkeley, CA 94720.

usn Women and Law 
conference recorded 

Legal issues concerning 
women are the subjects of six 
videos produced at the 15th 
Annual Conference on Women 
and the Law. These videos 
portray six of the conference's 43 
workshops and are available for 
public viewing. 

One video discusses access to 
abortion and focuses on "clinic 
terrorism," the arson of birth 
control clinics, often ascribed to 
ami-abonion activists. "It's really 
a First Amendment issue -
freedom of expression, the right 
to protesl.. . and on the other 
hand the woman's right to 
privacy," Diane Lowry, the 
conference coordinator, said. 

Other topiCS are : prostitution , 
mothers in prison separated 
from their children, women 
running for public office, 
comparable worth (the idea that 
jobs dominated by women 
should receive the same salary as 
male-dominated jobs deemed to 
have equivalent value) and the 
retention of the judiciary. The 
latter topic refers to the 
maintenance of Justice Rose Bird 
in 1986. 

Anyone wishing to view the 
videos for research or other 
purposes should contact USD 
Women in Law.

Communication 
chair wins 
peace award 

Plans for University Center 
edge toward completion 
By Rachel Freifelder, Senior Staff Writtr 

D r. Helene Keyssar, chair of the UCSD Dept. of Communications, will 
receive the 1985 Peace and 
Friendship Award for her role in 
promoting international peace, 
according to Chainnan of the 
San Diego Society for US-Soviet 
Friendship, David Bickel. 

Bickel specifically cited 
Keyssar's co-sponsorship of the 
simulcast "Moscow Calling San 
Diego: Children and Film," as 
the reason for her award. "Her 
(Keyssar's) promotion of peace 
and friendship with the Soviet 
Union should be recognized." 

The simulcast featured twO 
hours of children's films and 
gave children from the two 
countries the chance to talk to 
each other via satellite. The 
people-to-people presentation 
received international acclaim for 
its message of peace and 
friendship to the American and 
Soviet audiences in the twO hour 
telecast, according to Bickel. 

A DELEGATION of UCSD students and administrators will meet 
with the Kaplan, Mcloughlin and 
Diaz architecture firm to discuss 
recently drafted plans for the 
UCSD University Center 
complex this Friday in San 
Francisco. Members of the 
Student Center Board, University 
Center Programming Board 
Advisory Committee (UC;:PBAC), 
and Tommy Tucker, Student 
Center Director, will attend. 

Robert Lewis of the Student 
Center Board said that he was 
pleased with the plans presented 
by Kaplan, Mcloughlin and Diaz. 
"Aesthetically, it's very well done. 
There's a plaza half the size of 
Muir Quad with a water stream 
running along the walkway that 
leads into the center that 
surrounds the plaza. 

"One thing we wanted to 
make clear (to the firm) is that 
we don't want a cement brick 
building," Lewis said. "Certainly 
more planning is going into our 
University Center than went into 
other centers like Santa Barbara's 
or Berkeley'S: 

Lewis sa id there were still 
several problems that needed to 
be corrected, such as placement 

of handicap access ramps and 
elevators for the proposed four-
story building. Lewis said that on 
Friday the UCSD delegation 
would "give the architectural firm 
our gripes." After the meeting, 
the architecture firm will revise 
the plans taking into account the 
UCSD input, according to Lewis. 

The new University Center 
has been in the planning stages 
since about 1979, Lewis said. 
Builders will break ground in 
September or October this year 
at the site of the current 
registrar's office, which will 
either be moved or tom down 
completely or partially. 

The entire Universiry Center 
project will cost approXimately 
$20 million . Plans for the Center 
include a ball room, a five 
hundred seat movie theater, 
offices for large student 
organizations in addition to 
smaller rooms for other groups, 
meeting rooms, a new Pub, a 
coffee shop, a sundry store, a 
bookstore and sections for food 
vendors. 

A space of 72-76,000 
assignable square feet will be 
available. "Itl1 be twenty times 
the size of the Career ~rvices 
Center: Lewis said. Ii:! 

The award will be presented to 
Keyssar at a meeting of the 
Society for US-Soviet Friendship. 
Speakers at the meeting of the 
Society for US-Soviet Friendship 
will include Bob Simmons, 
professor of law at the University 
of San Dle~, floyd L. Morrow, 
fonner city councilman and 
president of the United Nations 
Association of San Diego, and 
David Bickel. The meeting will 
take place Saturday, November 9 
at the Granada Room in Baboa 
Park.

UC changes 
applications system 
By Dennis Woo, Associate News Editor 

T HE UNIVERSITY of California has adopted a new filing system and will 
put into effect new requirements 
for undergraduate applicants for 
fall , 1986. 

Under the new system 
students will have the option to 
apply simultaneously to as many 
uc campuses as they wish 
through a single application 
fonn . For the same current fee of 
$35, they will be considered at 
two campuses. For each 
additional campus , the applicant 
will pay an added $20. 

Applications for undergraduate 
enrollment at all of UC's eight 
general campuses have more 
than doubled in the paSt several 
years, from 39,464 in fall , 1980 
to 63,900 in faU, 1985. The high 
number of applicants lended to 
the decision to switch to a 
multiple-filing system, according 
to a press release from UC 
President David Gardner. The 
previous system did not permit 
multiple filings , 

Under the old system, 
students sent one application to 
their first-choice campus 
indicating a second-choi~e 
campus if they wished. If they 
could not ~ accomodated there, 

student enrollment as of the 15th 
day o~ the quaner. 

Points about UCSD enrollment 
include: 
• TOtal UCSD undergraduate 
enrollment is 12,110, up from 

applicants were redirected to 
their second-choice campus or 
to other UC campuses where 
space remained available. 

The new system is expected to 
improve students' chances of 
being accepted at a campus that 
is close to their first choice, 
according to the release. They 
also will learn sooner than under 
the old system if they have been 
accepted or rejected. 

The new qualification 
requirements were approved in 
1982, and will take effect this 
fall. The subject requirements 
include: one year of U.S. 
history/ government; four years of 
English; three to four years of 
mathematics; one to three years 
of laboratory science; twO to 
three years of a foreign language; 
and four years of college 
preparatory electives in English, 
advanced math , fine altS, foreign 
language, history, lab science or 
social sciences. 

According to the release, the 
aim of the new qualification 
requirements is to provide 
students entering the University 
with a broad-based academic 
background and to improve their 
chances of success at Uc.

lfProp, Ais "anti-growtb,"whyare

Undoubtedly, many developers 
honesdy believe Prop. A will be 
good for San Diego. However, as 
of 1983. 68 percent of the vacant 
developable land in San Diego 
was owned by twelve 
developer /landowners. Perhaps 
some realize that by limiting the 
availability of competing land 
they can increase the value of 
their own holdings. 
What's WI'OI18 with haYina the city 
vote on shifts &om the Future 
Ulbanwna areas? 

Elections are expensive. The 
City Clerk estimates the marginal 
cost of a ballot measure 10 be 
$35,000. In addition to campaign 
costs, developers will experience 
carrying costs while waiting for 
an election. The COsts of Prop. A 
could easily add up to hundreds 
of thousands of dollars that will 
be passed on to the consumer. 
These costs will be incurred even 
if the voters approve of a 
development, regardless of a 
project's merit Besides. land use 
shifts are complicated, dull 
matters. The City Planning 
Department's report on La Jolla 
Valley was almost 300 pages 
long. These details aren't easily 
summed up in a thilty-second 
TV spot. Only the La Jolla Valley 
shift was reaDy contrOVersial. All 
other shifts have been less than 
1,000 acres. The tentative 
approval last year for Torrey 
Pines Enterprises only involved 
fifteen acres. It is for mundane 
matters such as these that we 
elect a City Council. A vote on 
every shift request would be 
expensive and unnecessaty. 

If you are about to graduate 
and leave San Diego, then you 
probably couldn't care less about 
Prop. A. However, if you'd like to 
be able to buy a home here, or 
rent a place off campus, then 
Prop. A should concern you, 
Unless your idea of improving

Letters - Hot Winds 
Editor: 

Dave Richard's left-handed 
SWipe at the anti-apanheid 
movement for its alleged 
dilemma regarding human rights 
abuses in other country -
specificany the Soviet Union -
contains an elementary flaw that 
must be addressed. 

Aside from the fact that racism 
in South Africa is "morany 
wrong" as Richard eloquently 
puts it, he asks us to find some 
"priorities regarding what it is 
they are protesting: It becomes 
evident on closer analysis, 

however, that it is Richard who 
should re-examine his criteria , 

The protesls against the Botha 
regime are equally protests 
agai nst the United States for its 
hand-in-glove relationship with 
that regime. People of conscience 
in the United StaleS are often 
lambasted for their alleged 
"turning of the other cheek" in 
regards to the Soviet Bloc. But in 
fact, for the past 40 years, the 
United States government has 
ovenly and covenly pursued a 
program of anti-communism all 
over the globe. 

Whether one suppons this 

foreign policy or not is of 
secondary importance at the 
moment to the fact that it has 
been a stated policy of the 
United States government. There 
is no need to protest the human 
rights abuses of our enemies 
because our government has a 
policy that does its for us -
often to the exclusion of these 
same ptincipals it claims to 
stand for, What many people 
who protest the Borha regime are 
objecting to is the hypOCritical 
manner in which the concepts of 
democracy and freedom are 
applied to aUies and enemies. 

Reagan's suppOrt for the Botha 
regime lies primarily in his fear 
that given their freedom , blacks 
will choose a system which does 
not proVide the United States 
with the same "favored-friend" 
treaonent it now receives. 
Economic and strategic interests 
are again put In front of the 
basic democratic right of self-
detennination, and the result is a 
system which - whether better 
or worse than the Soviet Union's 
- has very little to do with the 
concepts of democracy so often 
invoked when the non-capitalist 
bloc is criticized by our 

government 
The United States is, in the 

final analysis, only concerned 
with human rights when it does 
nor: interfere with its economic 
interests. This is the issue that 
motivates many people to 
demonstrale against the South 
Aftican policy. Until the United 
StaleS removes the log from its 
own eye, the hot wind about 
freedom and self-determination 
will continue to be taken 
seriOUsly only by those gullible 
enough to believe It actually 
exists in U.s. foreign policy.

violators. In the Republic of Soulh Aftica, police in speCially 
designed combat vehicles pursue 
children (whose heinous crimes 
include chanting at funerals , 
stoning heavily armored police 
vehicles and boycotting school 

,classes) and then proceed to 
apprehend, viciously flail and 
eventually arrest, detain and 
tonure them without any due 
process of law whatsoever. In th~ 
Republic of South Aftica police 
routinely open fire on crowds of 
individuals in response to their 
protests to being denied basic 
human rights - rl2hts denied 
them solely on the basis of the 
color of their skin. We in this 
nation are aware of this because 
these are stark images presented 
to us each evening via our own 
news media. 

dissidents, political prisoners 
and other persecuted parties 
(Soviet Jews in panicular) are 
frequently tortured and 
sentenced to life m inhumane 
labor camps in Siberia, and a 
land where the request to 
immigrate is grounds to be 
declared legally insane; the Soviet 
Union takes its place as one of 
the world 's leading human rights 

Yet from the perspective of the 
American student there are 
imponant differences in the 

client states. In contrast a large 
percentage of the vehicles 
utilized by the South African 
police, for the same purpose, are 
manufactured by General Motors 
Corp. In addition, the tools for 
controlling the Soviet populace 
are of Soviet design. in South 
Africa the tools for enforcing the 
injust tribal homeland policy are 
complex computers provided 

A little closer to home, 
thousands of university students, 
here at UCSD and elsewhere, 
have begun to protest the 
reprehensible conditions under 
which South African blacks are 
forced to reside. These students 
find the actions of the South 
African government to be 
offensive and inconsistent with 
the concepts of equality, justice , 
liberry and civility; concepts 
which the un iversities and their 
shared histories teach them to 
hold in the highest esteem, It is , 
however, somewhat surprising 
that a few individuals are a bit 
confused as to why South Africa 
attracts more attention from the 
protestors than some of the 
other, more notorious, human 
rights violators, the Soviet Union, 
Poland, Chile and Guatemala 
being a few examples, For these 
unenlightened individuals 
(Guardian staff writer Dave ' 
Richard in particular), the 
follOwing paragraphs are 
intended to serve as 
enlightenment. 

In searching for a case 
example, the Soviet Union comes 
immediately to mind. A land 
where political opposition is 
illegal, where panicular socio and 
religious groups are consistently 
-oppressed as a matter of 
governmental policy, where 

cases of the Soviet Union and 
South Africa. For instance the 
small black vehicles utilized 
by the KGB to apprehend 
and transport political 
dissidents are Soviet made or 
manufactured by one of Russia's

Crossing Cruz 
Editor: 

I Want to express my deep 
appreciation to those who 
o rganized and part icipated in 
the protest last Wednesday 
(October 23) on the front ste ps 
of the Institute of Americas at 
UCSD. For those who did not 
attend the event , I want to assure 
them that the rallying students 
did an excellent job at drowning 
out the voice of the "faSC ist ," 
"imperialist," "bastard ," (Arturo 
Cruz) who was attemping to 
spread his self-evidently false 
point of view concerning 
Nicaragua. 

In fact , Sr. Cruz's point of view 
is so wrong that he docs not 
eve n deserve the right to 
Freedom of Speech as stipulated 
by the First Amendment - to 
the U.S, Constitution, that is, 
The rallying students went 
beyond traditional protesting and 
courageously abandoned the 
limiting tenets of American 
liberalism (as expressed by John 
Locke and codified by James 

Madison and Thomas Jefferson) 
in order 10 silence Sr. Cruz. They 
adopted a more internationali st, 
Latm American - specifically 
Sandinista Nicaraguan -
approach [0 such malconte nts. 

To be fair, though , the UCSD 
rallying stud ents have a ways to 
go to measure up to the 

stanqa~ of their compa triOts in 
icaragua. The Sandin istas a nd 

their supporters have a muc h 
more principled way in which to 
handle Anuro Cruz. As reported 
in the New Republic (on October 
8, 1984 by Roben Leiken of the 
Carnegie Endowment), "When 
Cruz began to speak (in 
Chinandega. Nicaragua to a large 
crowd which supported his quest 
for presidency), dozens of 
(Sandanista supporters) armed 
with sticks, stones and machetes 
surrounded the field ... , They 
proceeded to break the windows 
and puncture the tires of the 
(pro-Cruz) demonstrators' cars . .. 
(Then lhey) attacked the 
demonstrators themselves." 

So you see, UCSD ralliers, 
Anuro Cruz has been silenced 

much more effectively in his own 
country. It is a shame you could 
nOt have banged your d rums and 
ye lled your anti-Cruz slogans a 
little bit more loudly so as to 
have made all his words as 
inaud ible as most of (hem were. 

Review Reply 
Editor: 

Russ AUyn 

W e, three ed itors of the 
Ca liforn ia Review, must commend 
[he author, Mike Coste, and [he 
"undersigned" political science 
graduate students for their 
downright silly response to our 
"In Review" note on Professor 
CorneliUS, and their subsequem 
childish tirade on the California 
Review. 

All CR editors were compared 
to Joe McCanhy and 
Torquemada for the Cornelius 
mention "In Review." 
Considering the off-beat 
humorous context of the 
Cornelius commentary (which 
was printed below one grisly 
remark and above one obituaty 
notice) the comment , which 

and maintained by such 
companies as IBM and ITT. 

The list of differences 
continues and it serves to 
illustrate the main point. The 
governmental policy of the Soviet 
Union and the human rights 
violations emanating from it 
received their stimull (financial 
support) from the Soviet 
economy. It is also the case that 
the South African policy of 
apartheid receives its financial 
backing from the South African 
economy. The difference lies in 
the fact that the South African 
economy is maintained by 
numerous investments and 
enonnous profusions of capital 
prOVided by Westem nations, 
the great majority coming from 
Britain (approximately $17 
billion) and the United States 
(approximately $5 billion). 
Consequently, Western nations, 
while consistently condemning 
apartheid , are empirically 
providing the "wheels on which 
apartheid runs." 

It is quite important to nOte 
that, unlike [he Soviet Union , the 
Republic of South Aftica fancies 
itself a civilized western nation. 
The fact that its superficially 
democratic structure stand out in 
comparison to the numerous 
socialist as well as communist 
regimes surrounding it, makes it 
quite attractive to Western 
leaders. These leaders look upon 
South Aftica in an almost 
parental sense. South Africa has 
become the "democratic" child of 
the West with a system of 
government to be developed. 
Since the early 1950s the United 
Nations has annually condemned 
South Africa's policy of 
apartheid , tenning it immoral , 
reprehensible and unacceptable. 

derived from one edilOr's 
opinion of Cornelius, hardly 
qualifies as a scrious threat 
agaInst Cornelius worthy of a 
CongreSSional heanng. 

Let us remind you, Mr. Cos te , 
'et ai, that contrary to your 
twisted perceptions. we do not 
have the power of 15th century 
inquisi tors . nor even members of 
u.s. Se nate . Rather, we are 
merely undergraduate students 
who publish one of the fi nest 
collegiate conservative journals 
(whic h earns the cont inual 
praise of William F. Buc kley, Jr., 
George Will and General 
Alexander Halg - to note a 
few). 

You, Mr. Cos te. and your 
cohorts. as graduate students 
who hould hold a higher degree 
of integrity and responSibility, 
have made specious charges 
against us. Because of your 
patent pettiness, we believe that 
all of you signers of that 
dabbler's declaration, as graduate 
students, TAs, and evaluators of 
undergraduate performance. are 
a potential threat to academ ic 
objectiveness. 

As for Thomas Jefferson, we 
have no reason to attack this 
great deist because he, among 
others, insured our right to exist 
as a publication. Without 
Thomas Jefferson we probably 

Even so, Western leaders still 
accord South Africa with the 
same Status and legitimacy as 
any of the NATO all ies. These 
facts also set South Africa apart 
from its fellow oppressors of 
human liberty. 

Thus it is exceedingly 
appropriate for the Western 
student activist to place South 
Africa at the forefront of his/ her 
protest agenda. The reasons fof 
doing so are both prudent and 
responsible ones. Therefore the 
insinuation, (which Mr. Richard 
puts forth ) that student 
protestors choose to focus their 
attention upon South African 

a~~ocities solely because they 
happen to be presented with 
more documentation (be it via 
television, print media or 
whatever) is an offensive insult 
to the integrity as well as the 
intelligence of the thousands 
who march in defense of liberty. 
Of course this is not to say that 
it would be appropriate to ignore 
the well-documented violations 
of other nation states. Yet it is 
qu ite difficult to protest a na tion 
in which your protestations carry 
no weight and have little 
influence. Indeed it would be 
silly to prese nt (0 the East the 
message that the protestors seem 
to be presenting to the ruling 
South African regime. "We 
recognize the fact that the 
Republic of South Africa is a 
sovereign nation and the 
responSibilities of decision 
making are its own. We further 
recognize that if it is the 
intention of the ruling regime to 
adhere to its immoral policy of 
apartheid until the nation is 
awash in the blood of its 
citizens, we cannot SlOp you. We 
can however make clear that if 
this is indeed your intention , we 
condemn it in no uncertain 
terms and you can expect no 
assistance from us ( financial or 
otherwise)," As the position of 
the American student is clear in 
the East, so should it be in South 
Africa. And as the wave of 
protest across the universities of 
the West continues, it is quite 
apparent that it will be. ~ 

would not have been able to sue 
and to win our lawsuit, 
guaranteeing our Constitutional 
rights 

Lastly, Mr. Coste, please te ll 
your buddy. Mr. I Iulk Hogan of 
Rock'n Wrestling, that upon 
graduation we will not be his 
script writers because , 1) we only 
listen 10 classical music , and 2 )

for little kids up until a few years 
ago. They'd put on a witch's 
mask or cut eyeholes in a sheet 
and go out trick-or-treating in 
the neighborhood . Recently, 
though, the grown-ups have been 
catching up. ow it looks as if 
the adults might just take over 
Halloween as their special 
holiday. 

Each year more adults 
celebrate Halloween. With no 
e ffon a t all you can spot gorillas 
in grocery stores, pirates in 
parking lots , ghostbuster bank 
tellers , cavemen driving cars and 
French maids all over the place. 

There used to be a gas station 
on every comer before they all 
turned into banks. The next 
logical progressIon may change 
the ubiquitous banks into 
costume shops. They're doing big 
busmess, especIally around this 
time of year as we all seek to 
transform ourselves into 
somebody or somethi ng else. 

Why do we carve pumpkins, 
dress up In costumes and go 
mck-or-treaung? What do 
witches, black cats , ghosts and 
goblins have to do Wlth It7 

Elizabeth Memholz-Pineda, 
who teaches a course for UCSD 
ExtenSIon called "Exploring the 
History of Holiday Traditions ," 
says, "Very few peop1e have an 
in-depth understanding of the 
complex historical background 
behind the customs we now call 
'Halloween traditions.'" 

She says these traditions are 
rooted almost entirely in world 
religions. That's how she got 
involved with holiday traditions ' 
she earned a Master of Arts 
'degree in The History of 
World Religions at The George 
Washington University in 
Washington , D.C. Meinholz-
Pineda adds with a smile that 
she also has a real , personal 
fondness for the traditional 
holidays, "espedally the ones In 
the fall " 

She says the term "Halloween" 
IS connected with AU Samts Day, 
a major Ch risuan feast day 
which has been celebrated on 
Nov 1 sinc e the nmth century. 
In medIeval usage , the festival 
was known as All Hallows, and 
the evemng before It was caUed 
All Hallows Eve 

MedIeval Chnstlans m 
Western Europe devoutly 
observed Oct 31 as a solemn 
religlOus occasion by attending 
masses ,md reclllng prayers for 
the dead. But centunes before 
the ChriStian era , MelOholz-
Pineda says, Oct. 31 and ov. I 
were religious festival days of the 
pre-Roman Celtic tribes who 
inhabIted present-day France, 
Great Bntain, Ireland and 
Scotland. 

October 31 was the eve of the 
new year for the Celts, the time 
when Sam ham, a deity of the 
dead , was honored . The Celts 
believed that on this night each 
year, Samham reviewed, Judged 
and sentenced the souls of the 
dead . Since November is the 
beginning of the darkest and 
most barren time of the year, the 
festival picked up a smister 

significance, with ghosts, witches 
and all kinds of demons. 

Some scholars think the 
Christians purposely selected 
Nov. 1 as All Saints Day to 
counteract the continuing 
practice of the Celtic rituals 
since the date was already 
associated with the spirits of the 
dead . 

Many of today's secular 

Halloween customs and symbols 
were brought to the Untted 
States by Insh immigrants in the 
19th century Apples were put in 
a rub of water; an),one who could 
pIck them up usmg only hts 
mouth would have good luck. 
And the Jack-o-Iantem can be 
traced back to the legend of an 
Irishman named Jack. 

Accordmg to (raditlon , Jack 
was a stingy drunkard who 
trlcked Satan Into promIsing not 
to claim his soul. When he 
finally died he was refused 
admittance to both heaven and 
hell, doomed instead to wander 
the earth until Judgemem day. 
Meinholz-Pineda says, "To help 
keep Jack warm and Illuminate 
his way on eanh , the deVil 
tossed him a live coal from the 
fires of hell , which Jack carried 
about in a hollowed-out turnIp ." 
The substitution of a pumpkin, 
she says, is an American 

development. 
T rick-or-treating most likely 

originated from European 
CUSlOms aSSOCiated with All Soul's 
Day, a Christian holy day of 
pra yer for the souls of the 
departed who were believed to 
sti1J suffer in Purgatory. In 
England , for example, people 
walked from house to house "a-
souling" or "soul-caking." At each 
home, "soulers" were given small 
cakes or breads, called "soul 
cakes" in exchange for their 
promise to recite prayers for the 
deceased . 

One of the best known 
Halloween symbols is the old 
witch flying on a broomstick 

"~th her black cat Her famihar 
profile , with its Jutting wany 
nose and receding mouth and 
chIn, was most likely due to lack 
of dental care. "She probably 
dldn'( have tOO many teeth left," 
Memholz-Plneda says 

WItches were often older 
women, practicing the old ways 
of diVInation or working with 
herbs. But these activities we re 
seen as diabolical by the 
authorities , who hunted down 
and persecuted anyone 
suspected of practici ng 
WItchcraft. 

Meinholz-Pineda says it wasn't 
until the mId-19th century -
after the pOtato famme brought 
hordes of Irish immigrants to the 
United states - that the 
tradition we know as Halloween 
began to take shape. The holiday 
has changed a lot since then , but 
those jack-o-lante rns , goblins 
and witches are here to stay. 

Driving to the sounds of silence 
By KEN FURIE 

It 's Halloween, but that doesn 't 
bother you much. It's also 311m, 
but that doesn't trouble you 
either. Well, not very much , 
anyway. 

What does bother you though , 
is the night itself. This type of 
warm, windy autumn night has 
always set your nerves on edge, 
because the night seems, to the 
very essence of the word; alive . 

The night isn't gloomy you 
notice , because the wind has 
dispensed with all the clouds. It 
isn 't chilling either, since there is 
no moon. But as you walk down 
the street alone to your car, a 
lively breeze stirs the fallen 
leaves with a mighty sigh, 
tumbling (hem aimlessly; the wind 

rattles and creaks a ric kety 
pi ket fence, which had such 
nostalgic Innocence in the 
daylight. And the wlOd carnes 
long, shuddering howls from 
distant dogs who cry in response 
to even more distant, softly 
mou rn ful sirens. A cat scurries by 
suddenly, and SIlently crouches 
beneath a car, disappearing 
completely except for his 
gleaming eyes , which shimmer-
glow blink at you for a moment, 
and then disappear altogether as 
you approach . 

Everywhere you look the night 
comes alive , resurrecting itself 
softly but surely, and this image 
is only heightened by your slight 
drunkeness from the party .. 
Your senses have begun to take a 
direct path to you imagination. 

Reaching YOUi' car, you look 
around , listening to the darkness 
whisper. You tell yourself, with a 
sudden surety: · On a night like 

thiS, there is evil about." Hu Hee! 
Did you hear that? Evil! Hee Hee! 

Your car seems sluggish to 
respond , and you're having 
trouble keeping it from swerving 
as you tum onto the freeway. 
Gradually, you accelerate and 
settle into the fast lane . The 
freeway is empty. Completely 
desened . 

Rolling down your window, 
you put your head outside , 
hoping that the wind will brace 
you awake. After a moment , you 
tum on the radio, and a lazy 
male voice sings to you: 'There's 
something happenin' here. What 
it is, ain't exactly clear." 

Buffalo Springfield , you think, 
smiling, but then you notice that 
there is no music and that the 
radio is off. Hee Hu! You put 
your head out the window again , 
and shake it, trying to disperse 
the vague buzzing, the miSty 
haze that your thoughts seem to 
be wandering in , numbing your 
control. You tum the radio on. 
"Stop! Children, what's that 
sound, everybody look what's 
going down . Stop! Children, 
what's that. .. " 

There's a low, bristling, animal 
snarl behind you in the back 
seat , mean and angry. Gasping 
in horror, you whirl violently, 
throwing yourself forward OUt of 
reach. The car lurches with you. 
But there's nothing in the back 
seat. Whirling back around, you 
th rust the wheel to the left to 
avoid hitting the rail, and slam 
on the brakes. 

Slowly, after a long while , your 
hean stops its thumping on your 
rib cage, and you begin to relax .. 
Shaking you head again , you 
make a solemn vow never to 
drink again, but still your head 
doesn 't clear. "Please , God : you 
pray, realizing the seriousness of 
the situation , "jUSt let me get 
home without killing myself." Hee 
Hee. Tee Hee Heel 

Eventually, you're back in the 
fast lane , but gTlpping the 
steering wheel and driving very 
slowly. There is sti ll no sign of 
other cars. But you're ready now. 
Waiting, You know something 
crazy is going to happen because 
you're drunk and afraid and 
you're ready for It. 0 you sit 
there , nerves te nse. 

But nothing happens. You 
begin to relax after J long while , 
and you stan to pick up speed 
agin. But you don't turn on the 
radio. Still, you walt. Nothing. 
Now. Take him. Tane him! 

Shifting your weight in the car 
seat, it s lowly dawns on you how 
strange it IS that there have been 
no other cars. A Saturday night is 
a Saturday nigh t. But you realize 
that not only are there no other 
cars o n the road , but the re are l 
no longer any street signs or Jr 
a road divider or, in fact, any 
city at all. You're driving along 
on a long, empty highway, and 
by the signs of the brush by the 
side of the road , you're in the 
desen. 

You can feel your hean begin 
to labor again , and an urging, 
desperate heat surges up in your

gut. "What the hell . .. ?" 

Looking from side to side you 
see nothing. Blackness. Without 
any city lights, without any 
residents at all, without even a 
campfire in the vast emptiness of 
the desen, a dreadful, black 
lonely darkness stretches beyond 
eternity on all sides. Your 
headlights bounce out in front , 
reaching groping, grasping, but 
gaining no hold on the night. 

You are alone. In all of the 
universe, there is only you in 
your car, travelling along silently 
at 60 miles an hour; you, and 
your reaching headlights, lost 
forever, desolate. There are no 
stars, there is no wind. 
Everything is still. You notice 
that now, at last, you are 
completely sober. 

Seeing nothing but an 
occasional tumbleweed, 
blundering across your path in 
the windless night, which 
threatens and then disappears 
into oblivion; feeling nothing but 
the steering wheel and a 
painfully mounting terror, you 
drive on. Hours. Hours go by. 

Suddenly, away in the 
distance, you see a spark of light 
. You blink, and it is gone. But 
no, there it is again. Hope 
springs up inside of you, and . 
you push the accelerator to the 
Ooor. The light grows brighter, 
and then broader, developing a 
wide corona. Then it splits itself, 
and you can recogize them now 
as headlights. But they seem to 
be lifting, climbing higher, as 
they grow and grow, Perhaps, 
you think, they belong to a large 
truck.

Still they come closer and 
closer, and your hope turns sour, 
dwindling into doubt and then 
to fear. These lights seem to 
menace you from afar, rushing 
toward you, straight at you. Too 
late, you realize that it will run 
you down . You try to swerve, but 
you can't The wheel won't 
respond. 

The headlights are immense 
now, blinding, hungry for you, 
for your car, for your life, your 
essence, your soul. Closer, closer 
it comes, until it's almost on top 
of you. It will swallow you, engulf 
you. It swells up suddenly, and 
you throw yourself on the floor 
and there 's a blinding flash . Hee 
Hee! Tee Hee Heel Hte Hu Hte! 

Opening your eyes, you see 
nothing. But then your eyes 
adjust, and focus on your clock. 
4 :10 it reads. You're in your 
bedroom, lying on the Door next

grip on your blanket, which is 
on the floor with you. 

You notice you are fully 
dressed, still in you HaDoween

the window, and there's your car. 
But it's parked on the lawn. 

Thrusting a fist into your eye , 
you try to wipe the sleep from 
them. ·Was it just a dream, 
then?" you ask yourself. "But how 
did I get home?" Taking an 
uneasy step backward, your head 
whirls. Still drunk, you concede. 
So it was a dream, imagination. 
It was aD in you mind. Throwing 
off the costume, you fall into 
bed, where sleep is not long in 
overwhelming you. 

Dark, autumn, windy night 
runs whispering through the 

streets , restless, past houses and 
th rough alleys. Flutre ri ng here 
and there, kicking up leaves, 
slUicing through picket teeth, it 
pauses only momentarily by one 
house before it flees . It pauses in

snag of tumbleweed caught, like 
a half eaten branch, in its

Portrait of a teenage addict 
By Phil Lauder 

(This is the first installment of 
what is euphemisticalry termed 
"The Best of 'the writer's i.' .. This 
article was first published on Feb. 
21, 1984, 6- is rtprirued here 
because Phil was too damn ~ to 
write a column this week.) 

I was in 11 th grade when I 
first got turned on to it. By that 
age most of my friends had tried 
it. I heard the whispers in the 
corridors. A few red-eyed junkies 
even came right up to me and 
encouraged me to try it. 

So I did , I got away with it, 
too, so I tried it a few more 
times while still in high school. 
But I was careful not to get 
nailed, and reminded myself that 
the laSt thing I needed to do was 
get in trouble just before 
graduating. Bright boy. 

Then came college: a little 
more freedom , a little more 
responsibility. At first I did it 
only occasionally - moderation 
was the key. I was in control. I 
knew I could take it or leave it. 

And then I got a job, and 
gradually I staned falling more 
and more behind . I had to tum 
to it a few more times. But it was 

OK I knew I could take it or 
leave it 

Then the job got more time 
consuming, and the classes got 
harder. life's pressures staned 
beating me to a pulp. Suddenly 
my casual habit became a 
necessity. I couldn't make it 
without it. I kept saying I could 
take it or leave it, but the fact 
was, I was already a hopeless 
case. 

I was a full-fledged addict. I 
was a cramaholic. 

You've heard the pitiful story 
of the crammer before. Perhaps 
you're a closet crammer yourself. 
It's just so hard to keep up in 
school. You know you're 
supposed to read those three 
SOO-page poIi. sci. anthologies in 
the first six weeks of the quaner, 
and you know damn well you're 
going to be tested on the 
material in the seventh week. 
You also know more-than-damn 
well that you can't afford to 
attend school on the nine-year 
plan. You know all this . 

But still things come up. I 
mean six weeks - whal's that, a 
book every two weeks? No 
problem. In the meantime, those 
other classes surely deser::: ;Orne 

attention. So does your/'ob; you 
have W suppon yourscl . Besides, 
how often do the Olympics come 
around? 

And then you look at your 
calendar for the quancr. 
Midterm? Poll. sci. midterm? 
Tuesday? Oh yeah, that midterm. 
But you had six weeks to 
prepare for that one. What went 
wrong? "Covers first three texts." 
Three times 500 - that's 1500 
pages. 

So you do it. You cram. 
One all-nighter, twO all-

nighter, three all-nighter, four. 
You, Mr. Coffee and Mrs. Olsen 
get to know each other on an 
intimate basis. Where are those 
CI!If Notes w~en you need them? 

As your cram session begins, 
you take every shortcut you can 
in this, your hour of need. Take 
the first book, Pattern of 
Irnptrialism in 19th Century 
Indochina. Catchy tide. First 
chapter 75 pages. Must be 
introductory - skip it. All of a 
sudden you're on page 76 -
good job! Time (or a break. 

Sure, you get through it all. 
You always do. You stumble into 
your class for YOU! ~~~v and 
regurgilBte as many mufti-syllabic 

adjectival expressiorts as you can 
dredge out of what's left of your 
brain to describe 19th century 
Indochina. "In this paper I will 
discuss the socio-political 
ramifications of the French 
influx on the region of concern 
while presenting perspicacious 
perceptions on the derived 
effects - be they detrimental or 
beneficial - later experienced 
by poSt-World War II 
progressively pseudo-industrial 
societal members." Yeah, you 
crammed an ri2ltt. 

You've completed the cram ... 
and survived to tell about it once 
again. Perhaps that's the worst 
part. As your feet instinctively 
seek out the nearest spot on 
which to become horizontal, you 
feel somehow satisfied . 

Of courSe, having worked so 
hard at your cram, you're nO( 
about to touch another poli. sci. 
book for at least four weeks. Not 
until you next look at your 
calendar. "Final? Poli. sci. final? 
Tuesday? Covers texts four 
through seven?" And the vicious 
cycle continues.

# 1 Stanford coming to town 
UC Watennen lose to #2 team in nation 

By DAVID TEDROW, Staff Writer 

T HE UCSD's men's water polo team played a good game last Saturday. 
Unfortunately, when you go up 
against the number two team in 
the nation , you need to play 
better than "good" or you will 
lose . That's what happened to 
the Tritons as they fell under 
number two ranked UCI 13-7. 

The Tritons were nO[ 
intimidated by Irvine's high 
ranking as they came out strong 
s[Opping Irvine on their first 
possession, and then scoring the 
first time they were on offense. 
After a good feed from hole man 
!.any Sanders, Tom Moore put 
UCSD on top less than a minute 
into the game, but UCI utilized 
their speed advantage and 
scored two quick counter-attack 
goals. "They have a lot of fast 
guys: said Moore , "and their 
counterattacks really hurt us." 

outside shot into the net. This 
came after Moore had scored 
one the old-fashioned way - in 
a man up situation - to begin 
the second quarter. These goals 
pulled the Tritons to within one, 
but by the end of the first half 
they found themselves trailing 3-
7 . 

The abil ity to score this type 
of goal is what gives teams like 
UCI their big advantage. On the 
other hand, teams like UCSD 
must work [0 set up their offense 
and deliberately put the ball into 
the net. "Our offense is geared to 
work for ejections," explains Dan 
Kahl, "The players on our team 
like Jeff Smith and Greg and Jo 
Wade are not big enough to fight 
off their man and get the wide 
open shot off. But aD those guys 
are great at drawing kickouts and 
so we work hard on scoring in 
situations where we have a man 
advantage. 

Midway through the third 
quarter, with UCI on top 9-4, 
coach Denny Harper put his 
team in a different offensive set. 
hoping to catch UCI unawares. 
UCSD had both Kahl and 
Sanders down low, and they 
worked the ball between them, 
trying to draw a quick kickout or 
possibly score. Kahl believes that 
it's "a good offense to bring in 
because it surprises the other 
team. Chances are they haven't 
practiced against it or seen it in 
a game because very few teams 
use it. But we can't run it for very 
long, because the defense 
evenruaUy adjusts to it and is 
able to Stop it: The surprise 
seemed to work however, for on 
their first possession with this 
offense, Kahl was able to score 
and the next time down, UCSD 
drew a kick out. The Tritons 
were not able to score on the 
man up situation however, nor 
were they able to convert the 
majority of their other 6 on 5 
chances. 

Goalie Duncan Millar makes a save against Irvine last Saturday. Millar 6- Co. meet Stanford, Friday 

Apparently no one told Greg 
Wade that he wasn't supposed to 
be able to beat his man and get 
open, because he did just that, 
using the opportunity to fi re an 

'We only scored on three of 
the nine times we had a man 
advantage," said Moore. "We 
should score 60-70 percent of 
the time, and we can't beat 
teams like UCI by missing on 
those opportunities." 

Meanwhile, UCI made the 
most of its chances and opened 

the fourth quarter doing what 
they do best, scoring two qUick 
goals on counterattacks. The 
Tritons kept fighting, though, 
and Greg Wade made a good 
steal at half pool which led to 
another goal by Kahl. It was not 
enough lO overcome the big 
deficit However, and UCSD had 
to settle for a six-goal loss. 

It doesn't get any easier for the 
Tritons as they play the number 
one team in the nation , Stanford, 
Friday afternoon. Moore feels 
that to win, "We have to play out 
of our minds for four quarters. 
and we have to overcome their 

UCSD's FenCing Team recorded two victories over the weekend . Against Cal Poly 
Pomona our men and women eaSily oUI-pointed their competition. The women won 12 of 
the 16 foil matches, whereas the men were defeated in foil , 5-4, but won easily in epee 7-2 
~ .,d sabre 8-1. Against SDSU , the Triton women lost 7-0 in the foil. but the men took aU

bench strength by controlling the 
ball and stopping their 
counterattacks." Kahl believes the 
Tritons "have the talent to beat 
Stanford, we just need 
confidence. Maybe the UCI game 
will give the younger guys the 
experiencl" they need against tOP 
teams so that we can go out and 
play our game against them." 

The Tritons played a good 
game against Irvine and still lost 
by six goals, so obviously they 
will have to playa near perfect 
game if they are going to beat 
the number one team in the 
nation. Game time is at 3:30 pm, 
and all those in attendance at 
Canyonview will receive a poster 
of this year's team. Il3 

Sea Deucers diving 
into new season 
By let Peterson 

H AVE YOU ever been interestd in our mysterious ocean? Ever 
stayed up late watching Jacques 
Cousteau, or are you the type 
that watched Jaws 11 times? Well 
if you have (and even if you 
haven't), the UCSD Scuba Club is 
for you. It's a great opportunity 
to explore, party and meet new 
people. 

This should be a great year for 
the Sea Deucers. There are many 
new dive masters and instructors 
and there will be a great many 
dives. The club typically dives 
about four times a week. Some of 
the most favorite spots are the La 
Jolla coast, Hospital Point and 
Scripps submarine canyon . 
Scripps offers the opportunity for 
"wall diving" and has some of 
the most spectacular sights 
around. They also sink to depths 
of 150 feet or more where the 
sunlight is never found . There 
will also be an exciting 
expedition to Cabo San Lucas 
later in the year that is sure to 
provide some great diving 
experience and adventure. 

Anyone can join, no 
experience or training needed. 
The club, along with the school. 
offers introductory classes to get 
you started diving. Stop by the 
back-left side of the gym for 
more information. Tanks are 
rented at low cost and members 
receive all the free air they can 
use. Joining the Scuba Club is an 
excellent way to meet people and 
have lots of fun . Along with 

diving they have a great many 
parties, social gatherings, fund-
raisers and so forth . 

Meetings are held on the 
second Wednesday of every 
month at the Rec. Hall at Spm. 
Lee Olsen of the San Diego 
Council of Divers spoke at the 
first meeting on the efforts to 
save the abalone beds in our 
area. The Sea Deucers will plan 
to help the SDCD in their task 
of reseeding the troubled abalone 
beds. Anyone imerested in the 
club should stOp by and find out 
all the current news and 
information. Membership fees for 
the club are a mere $30 a year. 

President Flip Hunter says of 
his club , "We are a diverse 
organization made up of perhaps 
the strangest assortment of 
students, semi-srudents and non-
students on the campus. Our 
objectives are clear: to get people 
in the water, to drink beer on 
the sandy beaches of Baja 
California and to have a damn 
good time. (Not necessarily in 
that order.) We have no

12 Thursday, October 31, 1985 

....--BUDMAN'S INTRAMURAL FOOTBALL RATINGS-..... 
I have been asked numerous times the question "How the heck do you orne up wIth those 1M 

ratings?" U uaUy I basIcally Igncre the question or come up wIth my theories on why my poll is 
more legItimate than the UPI, AP or the Bottom Ten polls. But wIth the addition of around 1,000 
new studems thIs year at the "BIg U,"I think It time to finally expound on the most talked about 
IS ue on campu , the Budman' incredIble ratmg y tern! . 

It IS Imponant to reahze that these ratings arc done with the greate t of care and with the fine t 
In technology. Every Monday the Budman' ratings committee, made up of your truly, the 1M 
staff. the Chancell r and Mary from the Pub, meets to dISCUSS the pa t week' activltie . You talk 
about a group of Monday mormng quanerbacks. thIS group tops them all. Everything from color of 
uniform to the olor of a wIde receIver's gIrlfriend's eyes IS dISCUS ed at length. 0 ro k goe 
unturned. 

But with any large group, dIsagreement cern to be the norm. 0 It wa up to )'ours truly to 
come up with a et of guldehne to determme who's number one Much thought and 
consternation went mto the guldehnes. But after a night at the local spInes estabhshment,l finally 
stumbled upon a et of guidehnes. They are now u ed, abused and misused by the pollster at all 
weekly poll meetings. They obVIously eem to work. There don't seem to be any teams not In the 
top ten who de erve that pre tlglOu dIstinction 

ow for the gUldehne as defined by your trul . 
1. Team Name-The first thing the poll ter look for I the quahty and imagmatlon in choosmg 
the alllmponant team name ubtlty and cream'lty are a plu , being biatam IS a negam'e. 
2 . Team Unie- Thl I not a hIgh priomy. But thIS category can swmg a vote your way If you 
have a uniform that exhIbIts untque feature only ElVIra would apprectate ( he IS one of the many 
pollsters. It also should be noted .) 
3 . Margin of Victory-ThIS IS J \'er)' Imponam category Teams wlshmg to move up In the rating 
tread a flOe line here Pollsters hke to ee a convln 109 margin of VI tory, but a omplete blowout 
as In 60-0 can be a very large negative Close game against good competition will never hun your 
raung, but 10 e game agam t dogmeat competitIOn are a defmlte negative. 
~ . Competitiveness of League-If you are a bIg fi h In a mall pond, eating every small fish In site 
I a negative If you are a bIg fl h 10 a small pond and onl), ntbble politely, It IS a posltlve. If you are 
a bIg fish In a large ocean, that be omes a large positive If you arc a small fish In a large ocean .. 
GOOD LUCKI 
5 . Imagination of Offense or Defense- Imaglnatlon IS a large part of the game. Who (bes ides 
CB ) wants to go out and see the Dallas owbo s play week after week? Their otTense is about as 
excmng as watchmg a tree grow \low take the "Fridge". flattening the ompetltlon In 
ChIcago that's Imagination. 
6. Scouring System-The key here IS the number of outs Per Team Per Game ( PTPG). The 
SPTPG facLOr can be used to benefit an ' team If It IS used right. The Ideal SItuation IS to have one 
s out for cvery pia er on the team to be scouted Hlstoncally, the top tcams In the ratings have a 
very hIgh SPTPG rating 
7. Complaints About Ratings-Teams complalnmg to anyone assocIated with the Intramural 
Departmem about their team s rating tran lates Imo an automatIc drop In the rating [WO Spots. 
An 'one omplalnmg that they should b rated and are not probably never Will bel 
8. Verbally Abusing Referees-Another category that the pollsters look upon negatively 10 teams 
that can t secm to understand that every call made by the referees IS totally correct. Habitual 
bit her:. are habitually left off the Top Ten. 
9 , Pub Visitations-ThIS can turn your rating from poor to \'ery high In a matter of minute . 
Yours truly frequents the Pub rather often. A purchase of a few pitcher of beer for yours truly ha 
never hurt anybod)"s Top Ten rating. ~o one ever aid the pollsters are above being bought. In 
fact, I'm still trying to figure out what wa wrong With gIVing Kenneth DaVIS $38,000 to play at 
TCU 
10. What Brew You Dnnk-If, on one of your VI liS to the Pub. you are observed dnnkmg 
something othcr than Budwcl cr b) yours truly, I wouldn't look for your team's name In the Top 
Ten the next week LeI ~ put It thIS way II you don t dnnk Bud, your team can't be that good! 

Well folks. there you havc It Everythmg you wanted to know Jbout the Infamous ratlngsy tem 
The most Important thing for }'ou to all remcmber IS, "The Budman I ne\'erwrong!" lfhe IS,It was

I always get a little nervous whenever a nation declares a musician a 
"national treasure." In this country, at least, there is that fear, possibly 
irrational, that the person will be strip-mined or drilled for his precious 
resources. 

Now, it's extremely doubtful that such a fate should befall Raymond 
Thevenot, but the Swiss-born champion of Andean music might be wise 
to watch his step when he performs with his group Macchu Picchu 
Saturday night at 8 at the Mandeville Auditorium. Thevenot, it seems, has 
been declared a national treasure of Peru, for his efforts in what has been 
described as "researching, performing and disseminating the music that 
constitutes the authentic heritage of South America and expresses the 
depth and beauty of human spirit." 

Whew! And there's a slide show, as well, "seen on a background of 
soul-touching tunes that transport the audience to the mountains, valleys, 
plains and rivers of the High Andes." It is to be hoped that Thevenot, who 
will be accompanied by gifted guitar player David Sandoval, will make 
more sense than that statement does when he performs Saturday on the 
quena, a resonant cane flute that is tuned exactly to the pian? •

Theatre. 

Love, despair, jealous)' Eugene Onegin is sung in English, as will the The Marriage of Figaro and The 
Lighthowe. For those operas 
not in English (this season 
Orella will be sung in Italian), 
Opera Text is used - a means 
of projecting the English 
translation of a foreign 
language onto a screen above 
the stage. 

minimum of two years in 
advance, but usually about 
four years ahead. Campbell 
began planning Onegin in June 
1983, the same month he 
toole his position as General 
Director. by mariaret (arlin 

Saturday marked the 
premiere of Eugene Onegin at 
the Civic Theatre for the San 
Diego Opera, which began its 
21st season in September. 
Onegin, based on a literary 
work by poe,t Alexander 
Pushkin, is regarded al the 
finest of Tchaikovlky's 10 
operas. Set in 19th century 
Russia, the lessons to be 
learned from this story of 
love, despair, jealousy and 
tragedy are still relevant 
today. 

Saturday's production, 
under the direction of John 
Copley, successfully captured 
T chaikovsky's romanticism, 
bringing the characters and 
their surroundings alive. A 
few comical moments added a 
touch of humor to the 
otherwise serious nature of 
the opera. 

Copley, Resident Director 
at Covent Garden Opera in 
London, first directed Eugene 
Onegin at the Ottawa Festival 
in 1983. The sets and 
costumes being used for this 
production are , in fact , 
originally from the Festival. 
The simple setting of a house 
in the countryside in Acts I 
and II contrasted with the 
grandeur of a palace in the 
final act. 

Diego Opera as the young 
Tatyana, a role she first sang at 
the Ottawa production in 
1983. Our sympathies are 
captured by the innocent 
Tatyana, hopelessly in love 
with the fastidious Eugene 
Onegin. 

Cast in the title role, bass-
baritone Michael Devlin first 
portrayed Onegin at New 
York's Metropolitan Opera in 
1979. Tenor Richard Greagar 
from New Zealand made his 
San Diego Opera debut as the 
ill-fated poet Lenski, a role he 
will also sing with the 
Australian Opera in 1986. 
The strong vocals of each 
prod uced a c harming 
harmony when singing 
together. Their characters 
were convincing, as they were 
able to act as gracefully as they 
sang. 

The accompanying music 
portrayed the mood of the 
story well. The emotional 
expression characteristic of 
Tchaikovsky's works added 
to the appeal of the story. The 
orchestra, led by conductor 
Stuart Challender, nicely 
complemented the singing, 
although a few times it seemed 
to overpower the voices. 

Eugene Onegin offered 
traditional dance styles of the 
time period, including a 
peasant dance, a waltz, 
mazurkas and a polonaise, 
directt:d by John Hart. 

Other international operas 
to be performed during the 
1985-86 season at the Civic 
Theatre are Mozart's The 
Marriage of Figaro and Verdi '5 
Otello. During May, The 
Ughthowe (Davies) will be 
performed at the Old Globe 

As the General Director of 
the San Diego Opera, Ian 
Campbell makes the decision 
of which operas are to be 
performed. "I choose the 
operas to some extent to my 
own taste and interest, but 
also we look at the 20-year 
history of the Company and 
see what has been done. We 
see what is missing in the 
repertoire, and Russian 
repertoire has been missing 
for a while. Onegin has, in fact , 
never been done before (here) 
and I think it's a major classic 
that should be done. 

" We also look, obviously, 
at audience response ... 
Although I might, for instance 
in a four opera program, think 
of four operas I would love to 
see done, I have to balance 
that with what the audience 
wants to see. So always we try 
to put in something like a 
Boheme or a Traviatta or 
Rigoletto or a T osca for those 
who like those, and then 
balance it out with a variety of 
others. So, generally, every 
year we look for an opera that 
has not been done in San 
Diego and this year Onegin 
was the choice." 

"On Wednesday (Oct. 23) 
we finalized out first draft of 
what we think we will do in 
'89-90. And that's only the 
first draft. It'll change but we 
are already set for '86~7, '87-
88, and '88~9 is pretty well 
fixed, as well. It has to be in 
order to get the singers. Good 
singers are engaged three and 
four to five years ahead." 

In choosing singers, tty o~ 
audition , you go to 
performances, and you then 
put together a cast that you 
think will sound right 
together - the voices will 
blend," explains Campbell, 
who was himself a principal 
singer (tenor) with the 
Australian Opera for seven 
years. "You try to get singers 
you think will look right 
together, that can act, that will 
get on together in rehearsal , 
that are going to fit into the 
way we work. 

"For example, a singer 
coming to San Diego has a 

differen~ rehearsal schedule 
from the schedule he would 
have at the Met. At the Met, 
he might be doing an opera at 
night and he'd rehearse for 
only half the week. Here we 
rehearse them very hard, non-
stop for two and a half weeks. 

Among the nine principals 
of the cast, soprano Kathryn 
Bouleyn made her fourth 
appearance with the San Critics of San Diego Opera's Eugene Onegin leap for joy Operas for the coming seasons are decided a

From October to June the La Jolla Playhouse, 
whose annual summer seasons are justly acclaimed, 
belongs to this school. Or more properly, UCSD 
has use of the Mandell WeiSli Center for the 
Performing Arts. 

The Weiss Theater is state-of#the art: It has 
computer#operated lights stereo#enhanced 
acoustics, a fly#rail system for backdrops and the 
newest equipment for workshops, all of which 
improve the quality of the dramatic performance. 

UCSD's Graduate Drama Program educates 
would#be actors in various aspects of this 
professional and very competitive business. The 
selection of plays for UCSD's theater season is 
based on the needs of these individuals. Here, 
students worry about their craft and not 
commercial success. 

This quarter, the department will present 
William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Ben Jonson's 
The Alchemist, Charlie Russell's Relaxin' at 
Camarillo and Neil Simon's The Good Doctor, as 
well as two nights of cabaret at the Triton Pub. Two 
of the plays - Twelfth Night and The Alchemist -
are classics, while Relaxin' is a play in process and 
the Simon piece is an undergraduate project. 

" Of all the things we're doing this quarter, 
(Twelfth Night) holds a special excitement for me," 
said Drama Department chairman Richard Riddell ,

by arthur salazar 
who added that second#year graduate student# 
actors will be experimenting with the play. "This 
Twelfth Night is a work-in#progress based on the 
finished text. It's a fresh approach to a student 
trying to discover something about Shakespeare ... 

The A lchemist, the fall season's main stage show, 
provides "an outlet for outrageousness and 
audacious behaviour," according to director Walt 
Jones. Oanes, currently preparing a show in New 
York starring Treat Williams and Raul Julia, is the 
new head of directing in the UCSD graduate drama 
program.) The New York Times has called The 
Alchemist "one of the great comedies of our time." 
It concerns Elizabethan con artists who love life, 
gold, science and sex - "If there is a theme," said 
Jones, "it's that people are willing to be cheated." 

The play which at first glance seems to be heavier 
in content than the others is Relaxin' at Camarillo. 
This work deals with the problems endured by jazz

The Good Doctor is the undergradutes' one 
opportunity this quarter to produce a show. Last 
fall, the undergrads elected to mount LysistTata, 
which prompted Riddell to comment, "This is a 
nice contrast to last year. Rather than trying to 
channel the undergraduates' energy into a classical 
text this year, we thought we'd give them a chance 
to do a contemporary text that they came up with. II 

Around finals week, thank God, the Drama 
Department has decided to put on a cabaret of 
"skits, bits and anything" at the Pub -
"appropriate for the kind of atmosphere you find 
in a bar," Riddell noted, " people shounn', the 
television goin' on. It has to be big stuff, pretty 
RA W comedy!" 

Riddell is encouraged by the state of affairs in 
American theater today. He singled out an increase 
in playhouses around the country; San Diego's 
growth; non#profit theaters; and UCSD graduates 
finding jobs right out of the program here as 
healthy indications. 

On the other hand, he said, "The danger I see is 
the lure of movie and television, to writers worse 
than (to) any other group. We need writers 
desperately. The financial attraction of Hollywood 
is so much greater than (that of) the theater."

Pinecones artd more 
by alicia a801 

Mention arts and crafts to 
someone and what is the 
typical reaction? "People get 
this image of putting sequins 
on pinecones," sighs Ron 
Carison, Czar of Program-
ming, big cheese, plumber, 
electrician and all around 
director of the Craft Center. 

Although 99 percent of the 
student body has set eyes on 
the Craft Center itself, not 
many have actually taken the 
plunge and ventured inside. 
From its prime location, the 
Craft Center faces TG's, 
rallies, noontime sunwor-
shipers, and other s.uch 
campus goine's on. However, 

not many people know of the 
classes given, the artwork 
sold. and shows the Grove 
Gallery puts on. Says Carlson, 
"We offer college leveL classes 
on a quarterly basis. Our 
major area of concentration is 
in ceramics, but there has 
been a renewed interest in 
jewlery. " The classes 
themselves number from 8~ 12 
per quarter, meet between 
two and three hours a week 
and run for nine weeks. The 
artwork made in class, 
however, is not guaranteed a 
spot in the Craft Center store. 
. "We try to offer the best 
possible thinl/:s available in the 

store, be it ceramics or 
jewelry. We try to sell the 
stuff made in class, but it's 
more that the students aspire 
to have their stuff in the store. 
We do have a craft sale twice a 
year where the students have 
more of a chance to get in the 
store." The prices are kept 
low during the December 2--4 
sale, and also throughout the 
year with studio memberships 
offered to faculty, staff and 
the off~arnpus community.

At Grove 

Designating art 
by jay greathowe 

Various schools and 
factions stm wage war for the 
exclusive possession of the 
undefinable designation of 
art. The Bauhaus ( 1919# 
1933) revolutionized art by 
combining the "pure arts" 
with the study of crafts. In 
many ways, contemporary 
society defines modern art 
within the context of Bauhaus 
aesthetics. The superb finesse 
with which the constructivists 
grab the eye with graphic and 
sculptural works cootaining 
an architectonic emphasis that 
reflects our technological 
society is still evident today. 
Excellent examples of this 
style are now at the Grove 
Gallery in a joint show called 
"Illusions/ Allusions." 

Artists Jay Whaley and 
Carolyn Clark Bush are 
showing jewelry, wood 
sculpture and hand#painted 
silk kimonos through 
Saturday. Concerning her 
painted silks and kimonos, 
San Diego artist Bush says, 
"The patterns in my current 
work allude to the objective 
image of fish; the form of the 
kimono alludes to the 
function of ceremonial 
clothing. II She relentlessly 
explores the relationship 
between object and pattern. 
form and function. 

Bush has an art studio in 

San Diego and is a gallery 
assistant at the Installation 
Gallery. Whaley, whose roots 
are in the Southwest, is 
strongly influenced by 
Scandanavian design and 
today's popular high~tech 
styling. His jewelry and 
sculpture are understated and 
contemporary. In contrast to 
much contemporary art. he 
resists " . .. the influences of ~ 
bizarre forms and exotic 
materials, preferring to create 
forms with a more enduring 
and intrinsically valuable 
quality." 

While the obvious utility of 
some of the work adds new 
fuel to the "What is art?" 
controversy, Whaley'S larger 
pieces bridge any controver# 
sial gap in indivi-dual 
aesthetics . "Ligh tweight 
Anvil" and "Light Bar" are 
elegant three-dimensional 
puns, manisfestations of pure 
joy. Their precise con# 
struction forestalls any 
thought of casual effort in the 
embodiment of poetics. 
While much art today 
requires an education to 
appreciate, this is not the case 
with this show. With the 
assumption that most of the 
UCSD population falls 
between the classifications of 
quintessential art buff and 
cultural cretin, there is 
something here for everyone.

Carlson noted that "most of 
our programs require studio 
space. It has always been a 
plan of ours to add on, and 
with a deal struck with the 
chancellor, we got three-
quarters of the funds needed 
to build another room. For 

next three years, it will be 
in the daytime as a

classes, however, stays very 
high. Carlson is happy that 
"people return because we 
have a quality product. We 
have the best possible staff. 
UCSD is a tough school to get 
through to, though. There's 
such a strong emphasis on 
academia that the value of 
creative learning is not 
pushed." 

Carlson feels that the Craft 
Center workings bridge the 
gap between the average 
student and the UCSD Art 
Department. "It is a lettered,

It's October. You've taken 

that "One Last Ride" that Jan

unfortunately now it's time to 
hit the books. Happily, even 
though you probably don't 
have access to a VCR and 
MTV (unless you live in one 
of those decadent frat houses 
or - worse yet - you're a 
graduate student), you still 
have one legal diversion 
available to you: your stereo 
system. But before you drop 
down your ducats on some 
vital vinyl, feast your eyes on 
the copy below, where I've 
surveyed a few of the recent 
album and 45 releases. For 
those of you who can't wait to 
get started or don't believe in 
recreational reading, each 
entry has been assigned a 
number of stars varying from 
one (dregs of the earth; the 
musical equivalent of a 
philosophical discussion with 
Pee Wee Herman) to five (Will

Albuma 
Digney Fingus: Digney Fingus 
(Columbia) 
You might think that, as the 
Smuckers people say, a group 
with a name as unappealing as 
this (sounds like dingy fungus 
to me) has got to be good. Not 
quite. "The Girl With the 
Curious Hand," which leads 
off this set, is a primo cut -
danceable pop, with a heavy 
hook and just quirky enough 
for its own good. The rest of 

this mini L.P., however, is 
dispensable, lightweight rock, 
competently performed but 
eminently forgettable. Save 
your money and buy the 
single instead. * * 
SPK: Machine Age Voodoo 
(Elektra). 
I'm assured by the manager of 
one of my favorite record 
stores that this album is all the 
rage among certain a~dio­
philes. I have no idea why. 
This is monotonous synth 
rock with nary a shred of 
melody: all the sounds and 
rhythms of Today's Music 

without any comprehension 
of what to do with them, 
uselessly performed by an 
outfit from Down Under. 
Dismal. * 
Carpenters: Yesrerda, Once 
More (A&M). 
Sure, I know they're one of 
the least hip duos ever to grace 
the airwaves. But with as 
many as 15 years distance 
between the original release of 
these songs and now, it's 
possible to examine them with 
a little more objectivity. There 
are 27 "greatest hits" on this 
double album. Separated

image, "S\Jperstar," "Good-

others hold up particularly 
well. Of course' there's some 
awful M.O.R. dross here -
any radio station pro-
gramming "Top of the 
World" should immediately 
have its license revoked - but 
taken for what it is, and in 
moderation, this is actually 
fairly appealing stuff. And 
whatever you think about this 
type of music, the quality of 
Karen Carpenter's voice 
remains indisputable. Pardon 
me now while I go to the 
dentist. I feel a cavity coming 
on. * * * * 

Sina1el 

Marillion: "Kayleigh" 
(Capitol). 
On its first two albums, 
Marillion sounded like 
Genesis at the height of its 
progressive period, right 
down to the frequently 
obscure lyrics and epic (and 
uncommercial) lengths of the 
songs. It didn't hurt, either, 
that lead singer Fish sounds 
more than a little like Peter 
Gabriel. "Kay leigh, " the first 
single from the new album, is 
stylistically a change both in 
its short duration and in its 
more direct lyrical treatment 
of a relationship. For this 
song, MariLlion has brought 
together one of their most 
appealing melodies to date 
with an intense vocal delivery. 
All summed up it may (and 
should) equal a U.S. hit 
record, and not a bad one at 
that. * * *

Let's tvvist again 
by mikel coombe 

If you were wondering about the identity of that great 
singer who sang two songs - Elmore James' "The Sky Is 
Crying" and Hank Ballard's "Look at Little Sister" -
during Stevie Ray Vaughan'S show at the gym earlier this 
month, you need only to be at the Belly Up Tavern this 
Sarurday night. 

There you will find Hank Ballard himself, in the 
company of the current version of his band, the 
Midnighters. And you will no doubt find the r&.b legend 
in fine spirits, still ecstatic about that show and also an 
earlier Vaughan concert at the Greek Theater in L.A. 

"(Vaughan) really blew my mind at the Greek 
Theater," said Ballard, "so I followed him down to San 
Diego ... After the Stevie Ray Vaughan show, we drove by -
the Belly Up - only one of the bouncers was still there, 
but we gave him a press kit . So, good things came out of 
it. " 

Ballard first met Vaughan ("one of the nicest persons 
you'd ever want to meet" in Austin, when the latter, 
whom Ballard knew only by name, asked to sit in on a 
couple of songs. Ballard said, with obvious sincerity, 
"That was a big highlight of my life. " 

Of course. Ballard is no stranger to big highlights, nor to 
big disappointments. Providing an ample mixture of both 
was "The Twist," the trend-setting song that made 
Chubby Checker's name, while leaving Ballard in relative 
obscurity. 

Still, when asked to name the favorite of his songs, 
Ballard replied without hesitation, " 'The Twist.' And 
then, my favorite groove song is 'Let's Go, Let's Go. ' And 
'Finger Poppin' Time.' And then there's the 'Annie' 
songs: 'Work with Me, Annie,' 'Annie Had a Baby· ... " 

Although 'Finger Poppin' Time' is a catchy 
masterpiece, the 'Annie' songs are particularly important, 
since they aroused the ire of the 1950s counterparts to the 
Washington Wives. (While not entirely unsubtle, it is 
easy is determine the drift of "Work with Me, Annie" by 
noting that the immediate follow-up - discounting, for a 
moment, Etta James' answer of "Roll with Me, ,Henry"-
was "Annie Had a Baby.")

national opera company. But 
they tend not to live here, 
because if you live in San 
Diego and have an inter# 
national career, you're 
spending all your time going 
to Los Angeles to get a plane 
to go somewhere. If you live in 
New York, you can get to 
many of the significant opera 
houses like Houston, Miami, 
Boston, Philadelphia and 
Washington. You can get 
there so quickly compared 
with going from San Diego. So 
you're forced to go East, and 
that's not going to change very 
much." 

According to Campbell, the 
biggest problem with opera is 
that it is labor intensive. 
"That's the good old 
economic expression - labor 
intensive. It means it takes a 
lot of people to produce the 
goods. 

ttThe orchestra would 
number about 48 to 52 for an 
ordinary sized production. 
Chorus for something like 
Onegin numbers about 50. 
Then we have eight dancers. 
We have about eight 
principals. We have 10 people 
that we call t supers. ' Those are 
extras, in movie terms, who 
stand around on the stage -
do things on stage but don't 
actually sing." 

Others include the 
cond uctor, elec tricians, 
technical director, production 
manager, makeup staff, 
dressers, wardrobe staff and a 
stage director with three 
assiltants. 

ttThe reason he has three 
assistants is not that he won't 
talk to anyone, he talks 
direcdy to people! But we're 
dealing with a stage that is 55 
feet wide, and in the 
performance people have got 
to be cued on and off, so one 
of the assistants is on each side 
of the stage during the 
performance making sure 
things happen. 

ttSo when you add all of 
that up and compare it with a 
play at the Old Globe that has 
four actors, you can see why 
opera is so expensive!" says 
Campbell with a laugh. 
ttBecause if you do a play at 
the Old Globe, half the time 
they don't even have to 
change the set. It's usually a 
unit set. 

ttOur theatres are, in a 
sense, too big - 3,000 seats, 
whereas many of the 
European theatres in the best 
houses have 2,000 or less. 
There are many 1,0Q0#seat 
opera houses all over Europe, 
so the stage is a bit smaller ... 
they're very intimate theatres. 
But when you get a big theatre 
with a big stage, you get into a 
big stage crew as well." 

The result of all this 
concentrated effort is quite 
enthralling, as is evidenced by 
the poignant Eugene Onegin. 

A 50% discount on remaining 
tickets is gitJen to full-time 
students with identification for 
purcluues 4.5 minutes before 
curtain at the theatre's box 
office. Regular price tickets 
range from $9 to $39. Eugene 
Onegin concludes with 
performances tomorrow and 
Sunday nights at B.
