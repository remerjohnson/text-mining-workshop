Public scrutiny of 
tutoring program 
led to cuts, iaternal 
memo suggests.

A SOCIATE N EWS EDITOR 

A large budget downsizing 
ordered by Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph w. Watson 
to the Offic of Academic Support 
and Instructional Services' fresh -
men outreach program has been 
implemented one year early due to 
public scrutiny of the complex for-
mula used to place students into the 
program. The total budget reduc-
tion for O.A.S.LS. next year will be 
$150,000, according to the program's 
Director Patrick Velasquez. 

O.A.S.I.S., a free universitywide 
resource designed to provide assis-
tance to students struggling with 
coursework, offers many programs 
that help students improve their 

academic performance. In addition 
to providing study management 
programs and support for student 
learning English, O.A.S.L . offers 
weekly tutoring sessions for those 
having a hard time with math, sci -
ence, economics or foreign language 
c1as es. 

The bulk of the recent budget cuts 
- about $100,000 - stem from the ' 
O.A.S.LS. temporary budget, which 
has undergone increased public criti-
cism over a formula applied to the 
office's Community for Learning and 
Academic Success program, designed 
to provide counseling, networking 
and tutoring workshops for fresh -
men, Velasquez said. 

The formula used to deter-
mine CLAS eligibility, dev!!loped by 
Watson's office, uses an incoming 
freshman's AT scores and GPA to 
predict his or her freshman GPA. 
Using the calculation, the Student 
Affairs Office links all students with

The u.s. House of Representatives 
closed the book on one of the largest 
cuts to student aid in history after 
months of congressional debate, send-
ing President George W. Bush legisla-
tion that includes billions in cuts to 
student aid. 

The budget bill began its trek 
through the Legislature late last year, _ 
when it was approved by both the 
House and the Senate by narrow 
margins. In the Senate, where Vice 
President Dick Cheney cast the tie-
breaking vote, Democratic opponents 
made a ·point-of-order" objection 
because of minor changes made to the 
bill. The parliamentary maneuver sent 
the legislation back to the House for a 
vote; where congressmen approved the 
bill 216-214 on Feb. I. 

. The final $12 billion slash to stu-
dent-loan programs stunted last-ditch 
efforts by higher education interest 

~ which had been lobbying leg-
islators to oppose the cuts en masse 
since last year. The effort worked in 
some cases, when groups were success-
ful in swaying traditiona1ly conserva-
tive politicians to vote against the bill 

"The budget that was drafted in the 
House-Senate conference was a better 
budget and I voted for it in December:' 
Rep. Rob Simmons (R-Conn.) stated 
in a press release. "Since then, I have 
met with an9 listened to a wide range 
of constituents. ... The consensus is

Student-Run Television task force

remained unsure about whether or

UC wants guaranteed

By Charles Nguyen 
NEWS EDITOR 

Students could expect more pre-
dictable and perhaps smaller forms 
of fee hikes under a new bill passed 
by the California Assembly on Jan. 
26. 

The legislation, introduced 
by Assemblywoman Carol Liu (0-
Pasadena), would place several caps 
on annual student-fee hikes at public 
schools, including an 8-percent limit 
for undergraduate-fee increases in the 
UC system. Liu's bill was passed by a 
45-10 vote in the assembly, and was 
generally supported because of its pri-
oritization of students, according to 
Liu spokeswoman Candice Chung. 

"The biggest problem has been 
that students haven't been able to 
pl.an their .college careers;' she said. 
"You have students having to drop out 
because of one year when fee increas-
es go through the roof unexpectedly. 
[Students J'should never have to worry 
about not knowing if they can afford 
college, year after year:' 

Traditionally, student fees have 
largely been based on the health of the 
stale economy, according to Chung.

Ethanol as Effective 

as Gasoline 
Researchers at UC Berkeley 

have released new findings dem-
onstrating that putting ethanol in 
an automobile's fuel tank saves 
oil and that burning ethanol is no 
worse for the environment than 
burning gasoline. 

Published this week in the 
journal Science, the researchers 
hope their findings will help in 
the ongoing debate over whether 
ethanol is a good substitute for 
gasoline. The study weighs these 
findings against other work claim-
ing that it takes more energy to 
grow the corn used to make etha-
nol than the amount of energy 
produced by burning it as fuel. 

Researcher Dan Kammen, who 
spearheaded the study, indicated 
that results showed that ethanol 
prodUCe!! 10 to 15 percent less 
greenhouse gases than gasoline 
and that more ethanol could be 
produced efficiently if synthesized 
from woody, fibrous plants rather 
than corn. 

Regents Approve 
New Heart Center 

UCSD has received approval 
from the UC Board of Regents 
to improve patient services by

The project will create the 
new center at UCSD's east-cam-

establish patient-care and teach-
ing activities in both heart a nd 
vascular disease treatment and 
stroke management. 

Emergency care, however, wi II

$30 milliori for the construction 
of the new addit ion, which will

In tota l, the project will cost 
about $136.5 mill ion and will 

be funded through a combina-
tion of hospital reserves, loans 
and philanthropy. Construction 
is expected to be complete by 
December 2009. 

Health Institute 
Encourages Minorities 

The National Institutes of 
Health have granted UCSO $1.29 
million to develop a program that 
will increase minority stu{lents' 
interest in clinical research and 
health careers. 

The new program will be based 
at UCSD's School of Medicine 
and will send medical profes-
sionals to local high schools and 
bring students to hospitals and 
clinics. The program will integrate 
itself with high schooLprograms 
already designed to boost student 
interest in clinical research. It will 
begi n in spring with about 50 · 
high school students. 

Along with attending lec-
tures, students will participate in 
field trips during each year of 
the program to UCSD Medical 
Center. Selected students will also 
receive summer inte rnships with 
the UCSD faculty members taki ng 
part in the program.

A Council Thriller: Bringing 
Fees Back from the Dead 

Backers· Praise 'Fiscal Responsibility' of Cuts 

I n contrast to the politically charged meetings characteristic of pre-special election January, the 
first A.S. Council meeting of February 
was relatively calm and productive; 
the decision by roughly 8-percent of 
the student body last week to overturn 
a Student-Run Television porn ban 
attracted surprisingly little focus. 

The only SRTV-related discussion 
took place during the reports, when 

breached again during council cau-
cus. where A.S. President Christopher 
Sweeten asked for council opinion 
about a proposed increase in student-
activity fees to be submitted to Vice 
Chancellor of Srudent Affairs Joseph 
W. Watson. 

The council was asked whether or 
not it would prefer to propose an S8 fee 
increase per quarter earmarked espe-
cially for the A.S. Programming Office, 

or a $4-per-quarter 
increase for unre-

However, the bulk of the bill's 
supporters stuck with it, emphasizing 
fiscal responsibility in the face of a 
growing federal budget deficit. 

Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio), 
chairman of the House's Education 
and Workforce Committee, called-the 
bill a "common-sense" proposal. 

"[The bill] preserves and expands 
critical student benefits while simulta-

, neously generating savings in higher 
education by making programs more 
efficient and effective;' Boehner stated 
in a press release. 

All House Republicans voted to 
~ass the cuts. 

The legislation also light-
ens financial burdens on specific 
groups, Boehner stated. The legisla-
tion included suspension of loan 
repayment for up to three years 
for active-duty military and loan 
forgiveness for math. science and 
special-education teachers at low-
income schools.

however, is cuts to student loans by far

youth:' he stated in an e-mail .. 

The bill will hike interest rates 
for some student loans, including a 
Parent PLUS loan interest-rate hike 
from 7.9 to 8.5 percent. 

" I would say students and col-
lege groups lost big time on this bill:' 
UCSD Financial Aid Director Vincent 
De Anda said about the Senate ver-
sion last year. "Generally, it will cost 
students more to obtain loans and 10 
retire the loan obligation."

"We are on track for getting the 
station back on the ai r," Khanna said, 
addi8g that the goal of the task force 
was to submit the new charter within 
the next week. Khanna added that the 
task force has been in talks with acting 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student 
Life Gary R. Ratcliff to get the station 
running between the hours of 6 a.m. 
and IO p.m., hours in which the airing 
of pornographic material is banned by 
the former charter in voluntary com-
pliance with federal regulations. 

Although the council's porn ban 
was technically defeated by the elec-
tion, there was nothing but smiles 
and applause for Special Election 
Manager Puneet Gupta, who officially 
announced the results to the council 
and thanked them for their partici-
pation in advertising the vote to the 
student body. 

"J want to thank tho e of you who 
helped spread the word to your con-

Gupta said. 

The topic oC student fees was 

ing the two options, councilmembers 
wondered about thei r ability to garner 
student support for a fee increase, and 
whether or not the idea of an increase 
was itself contrary to the council's posi-
tion on lowering the cost of higher 
education for students. 

"It seems like every freaking year 
we have a fee increase:' Revelle CoUege 
Senior Senator Rachel Corell said, 
speaking in support of the gradual 
increase option. 
.. Thurgood Marshall College Senior 

Senator Kate Pillon took a more cau-
tious stance on the referenda. 

"[ think we just need respect 
enough to only ask for what we abso-
lutely need; she said. 

However, Cor John Muir College 
Senior Senator Conrad Ohashi, things 
seemed a bit more cut and dry. He 
concluded, "A.S. needs the money. 
Period." 

Ultimately, the council decided in 
an informal straw poll that the major-
ity supported the $8 programming 
increase. 

• BILL, from page 1 
Therefore, students attending college 
during an economic slump are auto-
matically at a disadvantage, she said. 
When the economy is bad, the UC 
system is forced to increase fees in 
the place of less state funding, plac-
ing an unfair burden on students, 
Chung said . 

"Th ere have been declines

The bill bases predictability on

rates, according to Bruce Hamlett, 
chief consultant for the Assembly 
Education Committee that Liu chairs. 
The legislation's strategy is dramati-

also provides for a uniform fee hike 
of 8 percent over 10 years, he said.

UC officials, however, have 
already voiced their displeasures 
about the proposal.

to run their institution; Hamlett 
said. "They've testified before our 
committee that they want a guaran-

has been made, and the bill would 
make funding issues harder, accord-
ing to Chuck Nicol, a consultant 
to the Assembly Appropriations 
Committee. , 

"[Plarticularly, the limiting of

8 percent may not be practicable;' he 
stated in an analysis of the bill. 

Although, u,!lder the bill, taxpayers 

would have to pay extra money dur-
ing poor economic time to replace 
student fee hikes, the reward is far 
greater than the cost, Chung said. 
The state has already shown that 
it can handle the cost of its stu-
dents, Chung said, referring 10 the 
governor's $75 million buyout of UC 
student-fee increases. 

The governor vetoed a nearly 
identical bill in 2004 because it con -
flicted with his compact with the 
university, which was new at the 
time, Hamlett said. 

If passed, the bill waul;! stlU act

Legislature and the university with-

A Full-Time Campus Needs 
a Full-Time Chancellor 

W ith the haggis undergoing its first incision, arid the bagpipes blasting, Chancellor Marye Anne Fox snuck out 
through the back door. Fox was 
at the John Muir College honor 
society induction late last week, 
where she gave a speech about 
excellence and quality - big 
on rhetoric, small on specifics 
- before absconding. 

C h ances a re Fox did not 
leave to attend a meeting of 
one the many corporate and 
nonprofit boards on which she 
sits. But the same can't be said 
of more than 180 other hours 
over the past year that she spent 
attending to business - but not 
the university's business. 

As the San Diego Union -
Tribune reported last week, 
Fox spe nt her first year at 
UCSD serving as a director of 
10 corporations and nonprof-
its , more than all other UC 
chancellors and most univer-
sity heads. During the same 
time, she received compensa-
tion from these 

of institutional review boards 
that must approve faculty proj-
ects and have access to propri-
etary information about them . 
Her dual roles represent the 
very appearance of a conflict 
of interest the new university 
policy aims to avoid. 

So far, the explanation offered 
has been woefully inadequate. 
Through her work, adminis-
trators have argued, Fox has 
helped the university increase 
collaboration with the corpo-
rate world. 

However, UCSD's success in 
commercializing new inventions 
long predates Fox's arrival; in any 
case establishing public-private 
partnerships is the job of the 
university's technology trans-
fer office, not the chancellor. 
Nor is it likely that Fox receives 
much real-world insight by lis-

the university and the potential 
for conflic ts of interest. 

"Employee members of 
the university community are 
expected to d evote primary 
professional allegiance to the 
university and to the mission 
of teaching, research and pub-
lic service;' the UC Board of 
Regents announced 'in a new 
"statement on ethical values" 
last month, a statement Fox 
herself sent to the rest of cam-
pus' employees. 

Quite presciently, the state-
ment concluded: "Outside pro-
fessional activities, personal 
financial interests or acceptance 
of benefits from third parties 
can create actual or perceived 
conflicts between the universi- -
ty's mission and an individual's 
private interests." 

There is no doubt that Fox's 
moonlighting creates just such 
a perception. As part of her 
compensation, Fox has accu-
mulated more than $1 million 
in stocks, including stock in 
companies that may compete 
with the university for grants 
or" bid to license faculty inven-
tions. ~ 

For example, Fox is a direc-
tor of both a medical device 
developer and a clinical research 
company; at the same time, she 
is privy to UCSD research in the 
same fields through a variety 

The fact is if the university 
was truly interested in bring-
ing a corporate culture to cam-
pus, it could have picked a new 
chanc~lor who actually worked 
in the private sector, like UC 
President Robert C . Dynes, who 
spent many years as a renowned 
physicist at Bell Labs. Fox, by 
contrast, is a life-long academ-
ic. 

Sadly, the university's tight-
lipped handling of the current 
controversy isn't surprising. 
Since her arrival last year, Fox 
has been plagued by a series 
of scandals, from unreported 
compensation to controversy 
surrounding University House, 
the mansion she was supposed 
to live in. In all instances, the 
university has responded with 
righteous indignation, suggest-
ing that .UCSD is lucky to have 
Fox, at any cost. Too little has 
been done to provoke an hon -
est and thoughtful debate about 
the chanceHor's role, and her 
responsibilities. 

This culture of entitlement

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Ashley Green 

Wha 1! "hic" I can stop drinking oil whenever I feel like it ... 
and I DON'Tfeellike it right now! You wanna fight about it?! 

Watch Out, Folks: These People 
Really Like Their Undie Runs 

Sometimes I pretend to be a serious journalist. So, when three students from Students 
for a Sexier Campus came tromp-
ing into the Guardian office shortly 

G: Oh. Now that we all kno~ch 
other and I'm acquainted witli your 
group, we're going to play Twister. 
It's gonna be awesome. This Twister 
set doesn't get very much action, so I 

figured you guys 
would be down. 

after 4 p.m. on a 
Sunday afternoon, 
I was somewhat 
prepared. I had 
invited them, after 
all. We were to 
have an interview. 
A sexy interview. 

Indecent .s: Are you 
.ielID1U? • Exposure - G:Yeah. 

[Then we 
Marianne Madden played some 

There was 
mmadden@ucsd.edu TwIster out in the 

hallWay. Their 
Shannon, the 
founder and president of the club; 
Mary, the PR vixen; and Will, the 
photographer, who's probably the 
only ~erson who takes pictures of 
nearly nude college girls without get-
ting paid. I was hung over, and told 
them so. They sat in th ree chairs 
arranged in a semicirqe; I sat with 
my laptop balanced on my 'quiver-
ing loins as the questions m typed 
up for the interview swam on the 
screen in front of me. They glowed 
with the success of their second-ever 
midnight Undie Run, held on Jan. 20. 
I clicked on my Virgin tape recorder 
~d the fun began. 

GlUlnliIIn: S.o how did you guys 
get the club [Students for a Sexier 
Campus] started? 

Shannon: Well, I've been talking 
to friends at other schools, and they 
always raved about the crazy things 
that happened on campus and their 
big events. All we have here is Sun 
God, and thought that was pretty 
sad . .. so [ decided that we'd start an 
Undie Run here on campus. 1 talked 
to my friend at UCLA, and they have 
an Undie Run there, every quarter. 
So the first week back from winter 
break I started making flyers. 

G: How awesome was the Undle 
Run, on a scale of I to IO? 

S:20! • 
G: You're ve.ry modest. I appreci-

ate that. 
Mary: Well, there's not much bet-

ter than people running around in 
their underwear. 

G: I was looking at the pictures 
on Facebook and I couldn't quite tell 
- how many people were actually 
there [at the Undie Run)? 

S: There were about 70 people 
who ran but at the end, there were 
probably more. People joined In 
when they saw us out there. 

WID: I actually counted . .. the~ 
were about 80 people in one of the 
pictures I took. 

Twister technique 
was obviously honed. Their limbs 
twisted in a pleasing manner. They'd 
done this before. Mary'S behind came 
close to Shannon's face at one point; 
Will played with disinterested attaeh-
ment but eventually won the game.] 

G: Well, that was fun. OK, more . 
questions ... on a scale of 1 to 10, 
how sexy is UCSD? 

S:Um .. . S. 
W: Iil say a 4, based on my genet-

ics class. 
G: On a scale of 1 to 10, how sexy 

amI? 
S: 10! 
M: .. . 
W: .. . 
G: Come on guys, this is a serious 

question . 
M: .. . 
W: .. . 
G: What is your organization's 

mission, besides holding crazy orgies 
every weekend? 

S: Well, that's pretty much it. 
G: The orgies? AWesomel 
s: [suddenly serious) The point is 

to have more traditions. 
G: You mean sexy traditions? 
S: Yeah, sexy traditions! Things 

that, y'know, people come to and 
they have fun. 

M: If you ask any" current or past 
UCSD student, they'll say the thing 
they dislike about UCSD is the lack 
of pointless fun. We don't have a 
rivalry with another school . .. we 
don't band together for big football 
games or anything. 

S: The point is to have more on-
campus activities that anyone can do 
if they want. 

M: Yeah, more on-campus activi-
tiel. We don't have Frat Row, we don't 
h.ve • lot of other things ... we don't 
have a lot of activities that you can 
walk to and then walk home. 

S: And our campus " 10 big, 
too! We have the .Ix coIIep 1)'IIem, 
which i. meant to am people the 

feeling of a small community, but it 
doesn't really. 

G: Does your group have any 
membership requirements? Because 
you guys are sexy, but not everyone 
is. 

S: It's an open club. The only 
official part of the club is that it's a 
Fa<;.eboolt SIQUP. That's the poiDt ... 
sexy is a state of mlnd .. lt rea11y is. 

S: If you're willing to be in your 
underwear, you can be in our pub. 

G: Has it occurred 'you that 
your club discrimlnafes against asex-

ua� people? 
S: [laughs) 
M: [laughs) 
W: [laughs] 
G: We're gOIll\il play the game Hot 

or Not. Chancellor Fox: Hot or not? 
M:NOT. 
G: Fair enough. If you could do 

one thing to her to make her sexy, 
what would you do? 

M: See her half-naked. 
G: You want to see Chancellor 

Folt ~aIf-naked? Are you serious? She 
probably wears, like, men's boxers. 

SAM: That's fine. 
S: To each their own! Sexiness is a 

state of mind. 
G: Come on. Chancellor Folt looks 

like a potato with a bad haircut. 
W: I'm sure she has a good per-

sonality. 
G: She doesn't. Hot or not: my 

boobs. 
M:Hot. 
S: Hot. 
M: Small boobs are sexy. 
G: Awww.thankyou.Doing it in

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR-
Soft Reserves Does 
Not Deserve Stigma 

Dear Editor: 
As the manager of A.S. Soft 

Reserves, I would like to clarify some 
of the issues brought up in your Jan. 23 
article, "Professors Groan Over Class 
Reader Embargo." There were com-
ments in the article regarding our "lead 
time." We set a deadline that is one 
month before the start of the upcom-
ing quarter. This deadline guarantees 
the readers' availability on the first day 
of classes. This month is necessary to 
properly obtain permission to photo-
copy as well as compile >and print the 
reade.rs. 

Materials submitted after our dead-
line are often available early in the first 
week, if not the first da)' - we just 
can't guarantee it. Any readers that are 
turned in during the first week of the 
quarter, barring a large copyright prob-
lem, are ready by the second week. 

It is very important for us to receive 
copyright clearance prior to reproduc-
ing articles for a reader so that faculty 
authors receive the appropriate royalty 
credit from the publisher. 

Another issue concerned our avail-
ability during breaks. A.S. Soft Reserves 
is open during breaks to prepare read-
ers and to work with professors for the 
upcoming quarter. The student staff is 
required to work "break hours" so that 
the course materials are completed -by 
the start of the upcoming quarter. 

A.S. Soft Reserves is committed to 
prOviding professors and students with 
the best possible service and keep-
ing the prices at the lowest possible 
price. If we are out of stock, by using 
our campus location and Imprints, the 
campus copying service, we are able to 
guarantee students a reader within two 
days. I f the reader is urgently needed 
for a midterm or test, we can usually 
have it available die same day. 

Now that other companies are 
re<JUired to follow the same cash-han-

dling polides that A.S. Soft Reserves is 
required to follow, the playing field is 
closer to being even.

Nietzsche's Thesis 
Misinterpreted 

Dear Editor: 
Marianne Madden, who frames 

much of her argument in ~When 
Paternal Administrators, Ignorant 
Alumni and" Hedonistic Students 
Rumble" (Jan. 26) around Nietzsche's 
"The Birth of Tragedy,' might do well 
to re-read that work:. 

Her simplistic summary traduces 
the text and glosses over its ironies, 
its self-deconstruction and its highly . 
problematic positions. Her own text, we 
might say, in its apparent "Dionysian" 
enthusiasm for philosophical words! 
concepts, completely unravels in the 
reading. It is, we might say, a "mad-
dening" miasma of misinterpretation. 
Still, she does turn a nice phrase, and 
her opinions are certainly provocative; 
they provoked me.

GUEST COMMENTARY------
Debt Saddles College Students with Worry 

By Christopher T. SweettJI 

On Feb. 3, the U.S. Secretary of Education's Commission on the Future of Higher 
Education is holding a meeting in 
San Diego. It will discuss questions 
about access, quality, cost and more 
- an awful lot for one meeting. As 
a student facing these issues right 
now, there's really just one question 
on the commission's agenda that [ 
care about: "What Is the true cost of 
a college education?" 

For me, and for millions of other 
students around the country, the 
true cost of a college education is 
more than just dollars: It's debt. 
Debt from student loans can take a 
lifetime to payoff and have major 
consequences. When [ start paying 
over $200 a month on my student 

ioans, how will I save for retire-
ment, buy a house, start a family or 
even afford to work in my chosen 
field (teaching, social work, etc.)? 
Plus, Congress just approved higher 
interest rates for student loans: 6.8 
percent for students and 8.5 percent 
for parents. That could mean thou -
sands more in interest payments for 
borrowers like me. 

Student debt is already the high-
est it's ever been: Two-thirds of full -
time students at four-year schools 
have student loans, and their aver-
age debt load grew a whopping 60 
percent over the last decade. That's 
because even public universities 
now cost more than most people 
can afford, not to mention othe 
necessities like housing and text-
books. Nationally, students graduat-
ing from four-year public colleges in 
2004 .had an average of $17,600 in 
student loans. 

As for myself, I a[ll the first per-
son from my family to attend a 
university - a dream my family 

has fought for me to achieve. The 
importance of going to college lies 
with the ability to give back to the 
community from which I came, the 
ability to give someone hope. 

The importance of going to col-
lege is to know that one day you 
will be <\ble to give back to soci-
ety through teaching, social work, 
health care, and numerous oppor-
tunities that can influence change 
withiJ!'our country. Having to bor-
row money through loans puts a 
Significant burden upon those going 
through the college system. Not 
knowing whether I will be able to 

ying to borrow 
o ey through loans 
puts a significant 

burden upon those 
going through the 
college system:' 

- Christopher 1. Sweeten, A.S. 
President 

find a job that would allow me to 
make payments to my loan lender, 
pay rent, afford affordable health 
care, and so on. I am a student who 
has to work in order to afford my 
status in the university. I work full 
time, carry a full -time class load, 
and maintain advocacy on behalf of 
the students at UCSD. By the time I 
graduate, I will be $25,000 in debt, 
which leads me to doubt whether 
I will be able to afford to go on to 
attain my master's degree and even-
tually my doctorate degree. 

Everyone tells you that borrow-
ing for education is a good invest-

ment, that you'll make a million 
dollars more than people with just 

. a high school diploma and thai you 
should do whatever it takes to get 
that degree. And we do, because a 
college degree is just about the only 
way to get into, or stay in, the middle 
class. But student debt can hold you 
back, instead of helping you get 
ahead like college is supposed 10 . 
Not everyone gets a high.paying 
job when they graduate. Even if you 
do, what if the company goes under, 
your car breaks down or your mom 
gets sick? A heftY student loan bill 
every month leave 00 many young 
adults without anything to fall back 
on when times are tough . 

Student debt is the true price we 
pay for college: We pay a lot longer 
than it takes to get a degree, not to 
mention a lot more than we actually 
borrow thanks to a nearly incom-
prehensible system that keeps pil -
ing on interest and fees even when 
struggling borrowers do everything 
right. In a case from Seattle, the 
U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled 
that the government could even take 
money out of retirees' social security 
checks if they still owe money on 
their student loans. 

Having to borrow more and more 
to get a decent education makes col-
lege riskier instead of more accessi-
ble, limits our choices of schools and 
careers and jeopardizes the quality of 
our education. If the commission is 
truly concerned about access, choice 
and quality, then it should address 
the growing problem of student 
debt and consider reforms to our 
financial aid system. Student loans 
should help increase opportunity, 
not condemn the college-educated 
to fmancial instability. 

Christopher' T. Sweeten is the A.S. 
President.

By Yasha Sharma 
STAFF WRITER 

D espite five consecutive nomi-nations for the Nobel Peace Prize and a base of celebrity 
and community support for the gov-
ernor to grant him clemency, Stanley 
"Tookie" Williams was executed on 
Dec. 13,2005. 

But there was an important politi~ 
cal outcome of Williams' execution. A 
group of Current and former criminal 
prosecutors mulled a two-year mora-
torium on executions, which was ini-
tially endorsed by the Democrats in 
the legislature until a political battle 
made them fear it could hurt them 
in the upcoming elections. Hopefully, 
they now understand what a waste of 
time it would have been. 

The aim of the moratorium was 
supposedly to discover the reasons 
behind the sentencing of the six men 
who were wrongfully convicted and 
released by the state over the last 20 
years. But it was presented without 
any kind of plan for studying the 
criminal justice system or passing leg-
islation to reform it. 

A flawless judiciary is nothing but 
a utopian fantasy, and convictions of 
innocent men and women are unfor-
tunate consequences, but a simple 
short-term moratorium is not even 
the beginning of a solution. It is, in 
fact, nothing but a cheap cover-up 
of the deeper problems, and would 
do nothing to bring justice to those 
inmates. The better course - and 
therefore the harder one - would be 
to put in the long and difficult work 
needed to improve the opportunities 
to appeal and negotiate a plea that 
are currently available to aLI those on 
Death Row. 

According to Elisabeth Semel, 
a professor at UC Berkeley's Boalt 
Hall School of Law and director of 
Boall's Death Penalty Clinic, more 
than 200 of those on Death Row will 

wait for four to eight years just for the 
appointment of a counsel to handle 
their appeals. Inmates sentenced to 
life wait even longer. 

What are the chances that an inno-
cent person will be helped by a two-
year moratorium? How many more 

_ might be helped if the Legislature 
- especially the Democrats who were 
seemingly willing to support the mor-
atorium - instead focuses its efforts 
on getting competent, lJmely repre-
sentation for these individuals? 

One cannot say which is worse 
- the death penal!}' or life imprison-

' [ simple short-
tenn moratorium 

[on executions] is not 
even the beginning-of 

a solution?' 

ment - but in the personal opinion 
of many, the two can certainly be 
compared in their degree of punish-
ment. How much n'Iore does a man 
on Death Row lose than a man who 
spends the rest of his life behind 
bars? 

It is the former who receives the far 
greater share of attention and resourc-
es, but a study of the legal system and 
its shortcomings, however, would be 
far f90re effective - in the long run 
- in serving all those who have been 
wronged at the hands of the state. 

Executions are carried out at a 
notoriously slow pace: There have 
been only 11 done in California in 
the past 13 years. By the time many 
inmates are able to appeal and are 
actually executed, they may well be 
in a sitUation similar to Clou:ence Ray 

Allen, California's most recent execu-
tion. Allen arranged a triple-slaying in 
1980 while serving time for another 
murder, but was 76 at the time of his 
execution, Twenty-three years in San 
Quentin had left him diabetic, legally 
blind and confined to a wheelchair 
outside his cell, He had had two heart 
attacks and a stroke and was too weak 
to grant interviews. 

Allen's argument was that he was 
too old to die, and that it would 
be cruel to kill him, He called San 
Quentin's health care system chroni-
cally deficient, and said that it was 
"punishment enough:' Many have 
faced a similar predicament. Forty-
eight of those on the Death Row have 
died in California before appeals ran 
their course. These people served a 
sentence that was functionally indis-
tinguishable from a sentence of life 

' in prison, yet they were able to tie up 
the legal system and demand a greater 
degree of attention than a person who 
received the "lighter" sentence in the 
frrst place. 

The focus should be on why so 
many innocent people have been 
wrongly convicted, and whether the 
state is capable of fairly enforcing 
capital punishment at all. Perhaps 
that was the Legislature's intent, but 
it .,pnly made it to the moratorium 
part and seemed to have lost inter-
est. The resuLt was a weak temporary 
measure that neither tried to stop 
capital punishment nor offered any 
improved justice to those. wrongfully 
sentenced. 

Lf the true aim of politicians is 
to offer justice to these individu-
als, including the many more who 
serve lengthy sentences for Crimes 
they didn't commit, then improving 
the health conditions of California 
prisons would be a good place to 

.start. After that, they can take on the 
responsibility - which only th!!y have 
the power to assume - of reforming 
the shortfalls of the legal system.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2,2006 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS 7 

O.A.S.I.S. Funds Based on Freshmen Grades A.S. Control of SRTV Shifts 
to Communications Officer • PROGRAM, from page 1 a predicted CPA of 2.8 or lower to 

the eLAS program. If a CLAS stu-
dent has a CPA of 2.0 or lower by 
the end of his or her first year, or if 
the student completes fewer than 
36 units, O.A.S.LS. loses roughly 
S1,800 per student, even if they 
never use the tutoring service. 
Conversely, if the student main-
tains a CPA above 3.0 and accumu-
lates 36 urnts, O.A.S.LS. receives an 
estimated additional $600. 

What makes the formula err, 
however, is that it is applied to all 
freshmen with predicted GPAs of 
2.8 or lower, regardless of whether 
they have used O.A.S.I.S. services 
or not, Velasquez said. Not only 
was the technique skewed to make 
the program budget less predict -
able, but it was difficult to reach 
out to that number of underachiev-
ing students, he said. 

Other UCSD entities, includ-
ing the Academic Senate and the 
Guardian's editorial board, lam-
basted the formula, forcing Watson 
to begin reducing the program's 
temporary funds, according to 
Velasquez. 

"IWatson] didn't like the criti-
cism of the funding formula," he 
said. "I think that it had some prob-
lems, but I think that the principle 
was sound. [Watson's] perception 
is that freshmen need help in tran-
sition, but we need money to help a 
wide spectrum of students." 

In June 2005, Watson sent 
Velasquez a memo, which has 
been obtained by the Guardian, 
unexpectedly cutting off the three-
year temporary funding for the 
CLAS program one year earlier 
than originally promised. Watson 
indicated that the reason for the 
cut was Increased outside scrutiny 
of the CLAS formula, according to 
the memo. 

"The continuing pUblic com-

plaints that the trial budget alloca-
tion formula is inappropriate and 
unfair to O.A.S.LS. has proven to 
be distracting and counterproduc-
tive," Watson stated in the memo, 
"I am therefore concluding the trial 
with this academic year," 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Edward Spriggs, 
however, flatly denied that Watson 
was "cutting off funding" for 
O.A.S.I .S. He said that the office 
staff knew that the cuts were com-
ing because the original agreement 
between O.A.S.LS. and Watson 
established a temporary funding 
program for CLAS that would be 
gradually reduced over a three-
year time span. After three years, 
according to Spriggs, O.A.S.LS. 
would need to find a way to main-
tain the program without an exten-
sion of its original temporary bud-
get. 

"After three years, temporary 
funding was to be ended and office 
budget matters were to be handled 
internally," Spriggs said. 

Spriggs altO said that the bud-
get reductions did not come as a 
result of criticism of the CLAS for-
mula, whi.::h is a separate issue. 

"The reductions are absolute-
ly not related to the formula," he 
said. 

Spriggs also indicated that 
Velasquez's interpretations of the 
budget reductions were mistaken. 

"Yeab,~ Spriggs said when 
asked if be thought Velasquez was 
wrong. 

He added in an e-mail that, 
although the office's resource pro-
gram seems to be working, it needs 
to demonstrate "concrete results" 
of its success in order to keep its 
budget from being reduced. 

"It is easier to gauge program-
matic outcomes in some areas than 
in others, and it is particularly 
challenging in academic support

programs like O.A.S.LS., where so -
many factors can influence expect-
ed outcomes," Sprius stated in an 
e-mail. "As to the impact of these 
efforts on academic performance, 
definitive results continue to be 
needed." 

This year, an additional $46,000 
will be cut from the program's 
annual general fund, which is cur-
rently set at nearly $1.264 million 
including salaries and benefits for 
office staff. Watson has also prom-
ised a similar cut in the upcoming 
fiscal yea.r, according to Velasquez. 

Velasquez said that the univer-
sity had no reason to cut the money 
and that it can find evidence of stu-
dent success as a result of O.A.S.I.S. 
by spending more time on inter-
nal and external evaluations of the 
office . . 

" It's kind of distu rbing and

real need to cut this money. I have 
to interpret it as a lack of priority.~

had power over SRTV in the A.S. con-

Artemis Quartet Pays 
Respect t~ Ligeti's Legacy 

By Meh,..dacl Yazdani 
ENIOR TAFF WRITER 

The critics, judges and internation-al audiences agree: The Artemis Quartet sO\lnd as sweet as their 
repertoire. Originally formed in 1989 
in Germany' Musikhochschule in 
Luebeck, the Quartet has won praises 
internationally ever since. Performing 
under the direction of established 
gia.nts such as the Alban Berg Quartet 
and the Emerson Quartet, it is no 
su rprise that the youngsters' musica l 
language reflects that of their teachers. 
Their performances have been well 
calalogued on CD and these record -
ings arc testaments to the outstand-
ing quality of their musicianship. Now 
they're on ' to take over t he world one 
ity at a time, La Jolla included. 

The schedu led performance at 
\Iandeville Auditorium consists of 
Mozart 's "Stri ng Quartet o. 22 in 
B-flat Major;' Gyoergy Ligeti's "String 
Quartet No. 1" and Franz chubert's 
"String Quartet No. 13 in A Minor." 
Although the Artemis Quartet'~ dis-
cography contains fairly difficult and 
courageous works. the ~cheduled 
pieces featured he re are rather tame 
and dry. Their more intere ting reper-
toire include works from Zemlinsky, 
Wcbern and WoLf. I n fact, the only 
in tere ting work on schedule i Ligeti's 
fi rst string quartet. 

Ligeti wrote "String Quartet No. 1 n 

during his early composition period, 
when the composer still !.ived in com-
munist-controlled Hungary. The pup-
pet regime, a expected, censored and 
controlled a g reat deal of the arts. 
including music and performance. The 
enforced art form of the time was 
called " ocial reaJism," which was real-
ly propaganda. Artists and composers 
had no contact with the West and 
their works were carefully monitored. 
De pite Big Brother efforts, however, 
artists continued to explore their craft 
regardless of the consequences. Many 
si mply did nol publish their works and 
worked in the dark. Ligeti was one of 
them. He never expected his ILfst string 
quartet to be performed and it never 
was lIntii he ned to Austria in 1956. 
Once in the West, he discovered and 
worked with contemporary geniu es 
such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz 
Stockhausen. From there, Ligeti devel-
oped his "micr polyphonic" pieces and 
became one of the mo t important 
composers of the 20th century .• 

"String Quartet No.1" is fairly 4if-
ferent and straightforward compared 
to his latcr electron ic and erialist-
influenced pieces. Obviously this is 
before his development of micropo-
Iyphony, 50 the composer' voice still 
had not matured. In tead, the quar-
tet is highly chromati in the style 
of early 20th -century yostromantic

'Imagin"e Me & You' - in a 
Three-Way - with Another Girl 

COURTESY OF FOX SEARCHLIGHT 
Someth ing blue: Matthew Goode (left) stars as a groom spumed by confused bride-ta-be Piper Perabo (right) in 
"Imagine Me & You,' a British romantic comedy that cross-pollinates "Runaway Bride" and "Brokebock Mountaill ."

CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

What's the name of those awards ' for poi-gnant films that leave an ache in your heart but a smile on your face? Actually, 
it doesn't matter, because "Imagine Me & You" 
won't be nominated for any awards. It won't net a 
Best Actress nomination nor one for Best Picture, 
because face it - Oscar material is in a class 
apart from this cheesy sorta fairy tale. 

"Imagine Me & You" starts out as the classic 
Turtles song ("Happy Together") doe - unbear-
.ably cute and romantic - becau e newlyweds 
Rachel (Piper Perabo) and Heck (Matthew 
Goode) make an adorable couple. However, like 
a bad remix of a better-left-alone love song. 
there is something which doesn't sit weU: Rachel 
has a twinkle in her eyE' for a female newcomer 
at her own wedding. There's supposed to be a 
heart -jarring moment between the two strang-
ers, although Perabo (from "Coyote Ugly") as an 
actress doesn't carry this emotion well. It's hard 
to elicit a true understanding when she has little 
going for her be ides a pretty face. 

The movie does have its saving graee, though . 
Nearly every scene is laugh -out-Ioud funny, 
whether it's banter between quirky father-in-law 
Ned (Anthony Head from "Buffy the Vampire 
Slayer") and his sarcastic wife Tessa (Celia 
Imrie) or between Heck and his arrogant best 

arc delightfully witty, and sometimes resemble 
caricatures, but there is a chink in the chain 
- they're extremely one-dimensional. 

It's hard to criticize a chick flick when the old 
romantic comedy formula i destined to have 
a joyously sappy ending, even if this chick flick 
has double the "chick" and triple the cheesi-
ness. It's meant to be acceptable for characters 
to be a Iitt le-on the predictable side. It's expected 
for everyone to conveniently !.ive happily ever 
after. But even a simple recipe can be distaste-
ful if there's no modicum of substance to it. The 
actors and actresses always say the right thing 
at the right time, which makes for an easy plot 
but imultaneously rebukes any kind of reali tic 
tension between the characters. Simply put, this 
movie is Like a smooth ride down Lesbian Lane, 
and without real bumps in the road; it lacks the 
heartfelt sympathy which could make it a memo-
rable success. 

That isn't to say that "Imagine Me & You" 
won't qualify as a 94 -minllte tres -reliever, but 
it su isn't worth the . of admis ion.

rampant than in Stephen Frears' 
World War II -era musical com-

of how the first live nude shows hit

Cat Power 
• The Greatest 
MATADOR 

***~ 
Confession: Ever since this reviewer was but a wee girl {well, almost}, she dreamed that one day Chan Marshall, A.K.A. Cat Power, would 
get together with Elliott Smith. In their perfect 
love, they would combine vulnerability and ten-
der, subdued despair into a ball of naked emotion 
unsurpassed since the late Nick Drake. Of course, 
the plan could very well have backfired, their bliss 
making their music's broken beauty evaporate 
away. Sadly, we'll never know, as Elliot Smith's 
depression led to a tragic end; so it's real hard not 
to give hearty blessings to Marshall for taking the 
recovered-tortured -artist route. 

Still, coming from the woman who once turned 
"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" into a tearjerker, 
prepare fpr whiplash. Her old bare-bone, trem-
bling piano/guitar arrangements often sounded 
like she was about to break down and stop - and 
reponedly, on stage, she often has - but her latest, 
The Greatest, is (comparatively) saner and sweeter 
than sipping Sunkist on the front porch. 

Boris 
• Pink 
TlAOlK 

**** Real men wear pink, and real bands change their sound. japanese intelligent-sludge rock-ers Boris take a completely different spin on 
their craft with their latest release, Pink. The key 
word here is intelligent, not sludge or rock. Boris, 
without a doubt, is the thinking man's metal 
band, and their musical change in Pink is no 
random occurrence. While on previous efforts 
such as Amplifier Worship and Feedbacker, Boris 
twinkled more with volume knob tweaks than 
catchy mdodies, here they delve into sonic tex-
tures mastered by bands such as My Bloody 
Valentine and late Unwound. 

But Boris is a lot smarter than that. Pink isn't 

And in good company, too. The native south-
erner went home to record with some of the musi-
dans whose soul she was nursed on, talents who 
have played with the likes of Al Green and Booker 
T. and the MG's. The result of this concept is pol-
ished, professional and pretty, but doesn't always 
stick. Marshall's on -edge voice drowns in this 
studio perfection, at times dwindling her to the 
inevitable Norah jones 'COmparison, yet she man-
ages to regain control in spurts. The opening title 
track and the dosing "Love and Communication" 
are eerily graceful bookmarks proving that the 
concept can bear fruit, while "Hate" is a throw-
back. all bare guitar and stripped voice, featuring 
the repeated line "I hate myself and I want to die:' 
Somehow, that's hard to buy. Not like the new, 
palatable Cat Power, which, for better or worse, 
should buy the erstwhile shy performer a whole 
different fanbase. Good luck out there, little one.

a mere copy or derivate of the previous master-
pieces like Loveless or Leaves Turl( Inside You. 
Boris knows how to write kick-ass riffs, riffs that 
rock heavily like the old Kyuss records or some 
moments of Queens of the Stone Age. One would 
think incorporating riff-rock into sheogaze and 
atmospheric rock to be dangerous and poten-
tially cheesy territoTY, and in theory it certainly 
is, but Boris pull it off perfectly. Lmagine Loveless

Youthful Prodigies Take on 
Ve Olde Mozart and Schubert 

~ ARTEMIS, from page 8 
composers like Anton Webem, Alban 
Berg and, most of all, Bela Bartok. 
Bartok was a great in.(Iuence on Ligeti 
due to Bartok's interest in Hungarian 
folk music and nationalism. In short. 
Ligeti's first string qlllU'ti:t is a formula-
ic sum total of early 20th-century chro-
maticism mixed with Bartok. resulting 
in a musically challenging yet highly 
accessible piece. 

It is unfortunate. however. that 
the Artemis Quartet will not perform 
Ligeti's much more important and, 
frankly, better "String Quartet No. 
2." Perhaps the reason for choos-
ing his first quartet instead is that it 
"flows" better with the Mozart and 
Schubert pieces. Still. the selection 

is very unfortunate. The Mozart and 
Schubert pie~ are certainly not a 
highlight of their respective genius. 
For example, the Mozart piece is fea-
tured on a CD titled Night _ Music: 
Classical Favorites for Relaxing and 
Dreaming. For many classical music 
consumers. their only experience 
with the Mozart and Schubert piec-
es is as background music. perhaps 
for sleeping. or simply relaxation . 
But hopefully, the Artemis Quartet's 
impeccable musicianship will evoke 
the original excitement and brilliance 
of these classical masters. 

Artemis StringQlUlrtetwill perform 
at 8 p. m. at Mandeville Auditor-ium on 
Feb. 4. Tickets are $16 for students and 
$36 for general culItIission. 

In 'Much Ado,' Se~ret Agent 
Theme ·Far-Fetched, But Fun 
~ SHAKESPEARE, from page 8 
sparring steals the show and fills the 
most deliciously clever scenes of the 
play. . 

It is their stubbornness and pride 
that prohibits them from admitting 
their love for one another until their 
friends decide to intervene by trick-
ing them into believing that the other 
is concealing a secret crush. Sharply 

cont~asting them is the romantic and 
impulsive love between the naive 
Claudio (John Lavelle) and the sweet 

' Hero (Kathryn Merry). 
. "Much Ado· is a complex play that 

straddles the fine line between com-
edy and tragedy. Claudio and Hero's 
love story has aU the ingredients of 
a potentially tragic outcome due to 
the villainous meddling of an embit-
tered rival. Don John (portrayed by 
chameleon Louis Butelli. who also 

plays two other minor characters in 
the show). It is only narrowly saved 
from a grim ending by a convenient 
solution and a happy song, brilliant-
1y composed by the multitalented 
Cochrane (who oddly resembles a 
younger James Lipton). 

Still, "Much Ado" is a charm-
ing and memorable performance. 
combining the wit of Shakespearean 
dialogue with physical comedy that 
beautifully illustrates the humorous 
elements otherwise hidden in the 
original text. Plus, with these domi-
natrix-style vixens to teach you about 
the psychedelic side of Shaltespeare, 
who needs Mi1ce Myers? 

"Much Ado" pUlys at La Jolla 
PUl)lhouse through Feb. 19. Tickets 
range from $26 to $55 for students 
and can be purChased olllille at www.

which I had to suffer. It's not even 
that I despise the Lakers or Kobe, 
but put it into perspective: Anyone 
shooting more than 50 percent of a 
team's shots better be making more 
than half of the team's points. This is 
simple logic. 1 don't deny that Kobe's 
talented, but just because you beat 
a team with a poor record does not 
automatically qualify your team as 

,playoff caliber, much less allow you 
to pump your ego up when your 
entire team hinges on one man. It's 
just hard to justify such flamboy-
ancy over a team that's barely on the 
road to the playoffs. . 

Another violator of the annoying. 
fan tendency is none other than the 
fans of the University of Southern 
California football team. It's hard for 
me to put such an awesome team on 
this list, but a team is not neces~ar­

Decked from head to toe in red and

yell at you until you concede defeat 
and bow down. The bottom line is 
that they're just too smug for their 
own good. 

After all this ranting, you may 
wonder then what IS a team that is 
over-the-top but not conceited. Ever

been to Oakland? This is where the 
distinction between being a die-hard 
fan and an annoying 'one comes; 
Raider fans are notorious and steal 
much of the team's thunder with their 
body paint, tailgate parties and inten-
Sity. But they've always been that 
way. They know when their team's 
doing poorly, but they'll still dress 

up regardless - because to them 
it's not just a Sunday tradition, it's a 
way of life, and that is what makes 
it respectable. True, they get in your 
face just to get under your skin but 
that's what the "Black Hole" is noto-
rious for. Which other sports teams 
have people going to their games just 
to see what their fans look like? They 
don't throw octopi on the ice after a 
big game and they don't even do the 
Tomahawk Chop in unison. Instead, 
they're there to celebrate their leams' 
shortcomings as well as wins, and 
that's what makes them die-hard, 
respectable fans. 

Don't get me wrong, it's deft -
nitely fun to be the biggest, mosl 
die-hard fan when it comes to your 
favorite sport teams. There's nothing 
wrong with a little trash- talking here 
and there; hell, slap a few guys up. 
But just make sure that, when you 
start spewing, you can back yourself 
up. After all, when the talk is big-
ger than the game, you don't gain 
respect . Instead, you gain a large 
group of people who would like 
nothing better than to see your team 
fall. So go ahead, sport your jerseys 
and strut your stuff, bllt if your ego 
is bigger than YOllr favori te team's 
salary, don't preach to others until 
the championship party.

Roethlisberger to Succeed Where 
Young Dan Marino Failed in 1984 
• BUS STOP, from page 16 

The Steelen have a few things 
the Seabawks do not. The team's got 
two good tailbacks to split carries 
and complement one another. a more 
complete defense that is strong at 
every position, and it's gOing to have 
a Detroit crowd biued in its favor, 
despite wearing Pittsburgh's contro-
versial road jerseys. As important as 
. their fashion choices are, the Steelers 
also live and die on Bill Cowher's 
decision-making. Cowher. who is the

High atmosphere. much like it did at 
the 1J0toriousIy noisy RCA Dome .• 
saw team memben poised, focused 
and completely dependent on them-
selves instead of fans, noise or hype 
- I saw a team very capable of win-
ning the Super Bowl. 

Matchupwise. Pittsburgh holds the 
advantages. Its defensive line is strong

a few gimmick plays out there, but, 
basically, the Steelers are going to 
pound the ball, wear you down and 
beat you in an unsurprising and _~­
cient manner. 

In an era when the creativity of 
Bill Belichick is praised as geniUS, the 
fundamentals of Cowher's Steelers 
might be viewed as a deterrent. 
The Seabawks should not bet on it. 
These Steelers are not fundamental 
in the boring Tim Duncan sense 
of the word. They're fundamen -
tal in that they will devour you in

terbacks selected before him in the 
draft watch the game with 40 million

eluding defenders, showing a pocket 
presence beyond his years and taking 
the big hit to complete the deep ball. 
Furthermore, the one-two punch of 
Big Willie Parker and Bigger Jerome 
Bettis is stronger and more deter-

particularly, will be the story leading

for Bettis to have a couple of goal-

Tritons Split Games Versus Arizonas 
• RUGBY, from page 16 
the Wildcats. 

"A lot of credit has to go to our for-
ward pack. led by senior Dave Chen 
and jllhior Pete Zi1a(, who ran and 
tackled hard all day long. and to our 
senior tlyhaIf Kevin Hannegan, who 
played a superb gune.- Stoner said 

Stoner converted all three kicks in 
the second half and went 6-fur-6 on 
thit day, bringing his total to a game-
hi&h 13 points. 

"Nick Stoner is probably one of 
the best tadden OIl the tam and has 
become a wry rftiable kicker; O'Hara 
said. 

}u time ran QUI, UCSD left Arizona 
in the cold, beating the Wddcats by 18 
points. 

The win brings the team's record 

to 1-2, but with five more games in 
the season, the Triton men are opti-
mistic . 

"We play at the Division-I level 
in an extremely competitive 1eague 
and we feel that provided we play our 
pattern, hit hard and low and run for 
all SO minutes, we can play and win 
against any team on our schedule," 
Stoner said 

In addition to a strong strategy. 
the team has stepped up its training 
regiment and ~ two SO-minute 
conditioning practices to the regular 
seuions run by assistant coach R.'. 
Haas. 

"The sessions [are I filled with 
running almost nonstop, including 
stair runs, timed miJes and sprints, 
which are interchanged betweett sets 

of push-ups and sit-ups;' Stoner said . 
O'Hara anticipates a good game 

against the team's upcoming oppo-
nent Cal Stale Long Beach. 

"None of our opponents so far this 
year have played them, but last year, 
they were a playoff-caliber team; he 
said. 

Stoner also commented 'that the 
team is looking forward to playing 
hard in the contest next week. 

"They are a good side [thatl will 
have size and speed, and it will be 
important to come out in the first 10 
minutes with hard running and solid 
taddes to set the tone of the game; 
he said.

STEEL FOR 

PITTSBURGH 
Super Bowl XL in Detroit is more than just a football game; it's commercials, camaraderie 
and constant conversation through-
out the game. Although we don't 
have character like Terrell Owens in 
this year' big game, there are plenty 
of other side stories leading into this 
game to entertain me as I munch on 

uper Bowl snacks come kickoff.

The Seattle Sea hawks have, as 
George W. Bush would say, been "mis-
underestimated" all season. Many 
contribute this to the fact that they 
play all tucked away in the northwe t 
corner of the country, far from any 
other NFL team. I dismiss this claim 
on the basis that I) Washington is not 
the Lost City of Atlaniis, and 2) Even 
if it was the Lost City of Atlantis, 
ports media are 0 rapidly expand- • 

ing that I could probably still learn 
all about Coach Mike Holmgren's 
life, including information about his 
team, how sad he gets when it loses 
and how much he loves Fall Oul Boy. 

I accounl eattle's low level of 
respect to the la k of wins over qual-
ity competition this season. However, 
that all changed on Jan. 22 when the 
eahawks proved that the win over 

the Giants wasn't a fluke (OK, it kind 
of was) and that the win over the 
Redskins was impressive (all right, 
maybe not) and that they deserved 
a trip to the Super Bowl by handing 
the red-hot Carolina Panthers a 34-14 
beat down. 

0 , is the reason Seattle can wi n 
that its only impressive win over a 
playoff team came in the playoffs? 
Exactly. Seattle won when it mattered. 
The best team in FL history was the 
1969 Minnesota Vikings, but it lost to 
lhe Kansas Chiefs in Super Bowl IV, 
o nobody cares about the team any-

more. Nevermind that the Seahawks 
might not have been the best team 
the entire season; if they win Super 
Bowl XL, they can claim that honor 
as the champions of the FL. 

Of course, Super Bowl win or not, 
this Seattle team is no slouch. It's got 
MVP Shaun Alexander as running 
back and Pro Bowlers in quarter-
back Matt Hasselbeck, fullback Mack 
Strong, tackle Walter Jones and guard 
Steve Hutchinson. Wide receiver 
Darrel Jackson is also healthy now, 
while fellow wide-out Joe Jurevicious 
has experience under the Super Bowl 
spotlight. This dynamic offense has 
scored no fewer than 13 points in any 
game all season and has racked up 
over 30 on eight separate occasions. 

Smells like team spirit? No. Sure, 
offense is exciting and probably 
defining for this squad, but as the 
adage goe , defense wins champion-
ships, and fortunately, like Starbucks, 
rain and grunge, Seattle has that, too. 
lts defense led the NFL in sacks this 
year and rookie middle linebacker 
Lofa Tatupu has taken control of the 
defen e in his first year in the NFL 
and has made eattle an actual force. 

Can this team score points? Yes. 
Does it have to keep up in a shoot-
out? No. Would it have made the 
playoffs in the AFC? Probably not. 
However, it was lucky enough to play 
in the mediocre NFC and will repre-
sent the weaker conference to the best 
of its abilities come game time.

Tritons bounce back

with a 38-20 win over 
the Wildcats.

STAFF WRITER 

The UCSD men's rugby team 
fought hard to overcome a valiant 
effort from the University of Arizona 
on Jan. 29 at Warren Field. The Triton 
men trumped their Wildcat counter-
parts, ranked No. 17 in the nation, by 
a final score of 3S-20. 

The Tritons were determined to 
come out on top after a tough loss 

late in the game against Arizona State 
University, just two days eaI'l1er. 

"We lost by only three points 
on Friday to an ASU team that we 
felt we should have beat, so that 
was a real motivation going into the 
Sunday game against U of A, [which 
is] a much better [team]:' senior 
tearn captain Nicky Stoner said. "We 
just knew we needed to come up big, 
and I think everyone approached 
the game with the mindset that we 
would not have a repeat of Friday.' 

Despite the motivation, the play-
ers knew they had a tough game 
ahead of them. 

"Going into Sunday's game, we 
felt like we had to cut out our mis-
takes arid play smart:' coach Tim 
O'Hara said. "We managed to do that 

and played a solid game:' 
The match starteci off at a quick 

pace, with junior crumhalf Chad 
Allen and rookie flanker Dallin 
Lindahl each scoring tries. Stoner 
converted both tries for two points 
each and contributed a penalty kick 
before the end of the first half. At the 
end of the first 40 minutes, the score 
was tied at 17 points. 

The University of .Arizona carne 
back early in the second half with a 
penalty kick, but it would be the last 
time it scored' in the match. Three 
more Triton tries, two from junior 
Nik Cherwink and one more from 
Allen, coupled with an imPenetrable 
defense, proved too strong a force for

Fans Need a 
Visit to the 
Black Hole 
B ehind every good sports team (and bad, in many cases) is a legion of die-hard fans, 
but whether they're band wagoners 
or faithful groupies, they all join 
together for one purpose: to rag on 
other teams and convince others 
that their. team is going to the top. 
In the past few weeks I've come to 
realize the thin line between being 
a die-hard sports fan and being an 
annoying one; the distinction comes 
as a blur, but when you cross the 
line, there's no turning back. For 

the ones who openly talk uniniti -
ated trash and those who sport their 
favorite jerseys and walk around 
with the same cockiness as the let-
ters emblazoned on their backs, I 
have four words for you: Get over 
it. Quick. 

Trying to compile a list of the 
most annoying fans wasn't hard. 
Granted, there will always be a bias 
in anyone's perception, but the big-
gest offenders of this line are, hands 
down, the Los Angeles Lakers fans . I 
cannot even count how many Kobe 
jerseys I saw the day after Bryant's 
SI -point contribution over the 
Toronto Raplors, one of the worst 
teams in the NBA, and, further-
more, the myriad "the-Lakers-are-
coming-up" conversations through

Tritons Force Overtime, But Fall to Chapman

SIAFF WRITER 

Good things do not come in 
threes for the Tritons. After taking 
two games in extra periOds earlier 
this season., UCSD dropped a heart-
breaker in its final nonconference 
game, losing to Chapman, 70-64, in 
overtime on Jan. 31. 

The game started looking more 
like a blowout than a thriller in the 
flTSt half, as the Tritons fell behind by 
nine in the first two minutes and were 
never closer than five points at'ter the 
early Chapman run. 

While the Panthers could not put 
UCSO away in front of the hometown 
crowd inside Hutton Sports Arena, 
they did grab a double-digit lead mid-
way through the first half, and pushed 
their advantage to as much as 1 S. 

"That's two games in a row with 
slow starts, and there is no real expla-
nation, [except] that the other tearn 
has been the aggressor both nights:' 
sophomore guard Clint Allard said 
about, the Tritons' first-half perfor-
mance. 

Freshman guard Shane Poppen 
helped UCSD avoid being decimated, 
coming off the bench to score nine of 
the Tritons' 21 first -half points. 

"I really focused on driving the 
lane, getting by the defender, pret-
ty much getting to the rim," said 
Poppen, who has bounced between 
the starting lineup and the bench 
this season. "This led to free throws 
and layups, which are high-percent-
age shots. Whether I arn starting or 
coming off the bench, I am ~ 
comfortable. [I'm] just trying to belp 
the team anyway I can." 

Coming out of halftime, down by 
13, the Tritons exhibited that team 
mentality, staging a much-needed 
comeback for the second-consecu-
tive game. With Poppen adding four 
more points and the tearn playing 
staunch defense and moving the ball 
effectively, the Tritons matched their 
first -half output just over six minutes 
into the second half. With its defense 
allowing only seven points in that 
stretch, UCSO now found itself with 
an improbable 42-41 lead. 

"We were more aggressive, we had 
more energy and we started to play 
defense," senior guard Odioh Odiye 
said. 

Any cobwebs present during 
UCSO's slow start seemed to have 
been brushed away, as the team held 
on to its lead. 

While never extending to a truly 
comfortable lead, the young Triton 
squad played poised basketball and 
stayed in front for most of the sec-
ond half. However, with less than five 
minutes left, the Panthers pounced, 
regaining the. lead with seven-straight 
points. Not phased by the new deficit, 
the Tritons executed perfectly after 
the Panthers' Patrick Carney missed 
his second free th .. ow. 

"We pushed the ball in transi-
tion after a missed free throw, and 
J was able to get free for a relatively 
unguarded lane to the baskd," Allard 
said, describing his game-tying basket 
with 41 seconds left to play. "When 
[Chapman) came back down, we rec-
ognized they were running the same 
play that they had just run, and so we 
switched the screens and I was able to
