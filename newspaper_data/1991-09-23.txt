UC'a AccountIIC 01 Nucllar Plants 
QuestIoned by F8dera11rwestIJptora 

WASHINGTON, D.C.- Federal invesciplOrl lie-
cused the University of California in cady August of 
failing to account for more than $4S million worth of 
government propeny used by the UC to manage three 
nuclear laboratories. 

Blaming the failure on the university's invenlory ac-
counting practices and its "lax" oversight of the labs. 
auditors told U.S. lawmakers in Washington that the UC 
was unable to account for more than 2,700 items it 
purchased with tax money. 

However. the lUliversity rejectedthecharges. University 
officials say their accounting methods, which do nor keep 
tabs on items which cost less than $1,000, are sound. This 
method accounts for nearly two-thirds oftbe money that 
the federal auditors say is missing. 

The findings were presented by the General Account-
ing OffICe, an investigative branch .of Congress, to a 

. House subcommittee on science. space and technology.

The Parking Question 
News EclJtor 

You stood in two-hour long lines and 
braved the computer system 
breakdowns at Ihe cahier's of-
fice to pay your fees for parking 
on campus. But will your check 
book buckle under the recent 
parlcing fee hike? And is the 
privilege to park on campus 
wonh the price? 

At the beginning of the sum-
mer, Vice Chancellor of Busi-
ness Affairs Steve Relyea approved an in-
crease in parking fees for the UCSD commu-
nity. But while the rise may seem dizzying, 
the increase is a compromise between two 
parlting proposals that raises the basic permit 

prices by the smallest increments possible. 
This year. students purchasing the basic 

.. s .. parking pennit will pay a $75 quarterly 
(three month) fee. Staff mem-
berswillpay$IOI.33perquar-
ter for "B" pennits, and fac-
ultywiUpay$IIO.83perquar-
ter for "A" pennits. 

This is an increase of $3 
per month for student parlcing 
and $4 per month for bolh 
faculty and staff parking per-
mits. 

In compromising, Relyea chose the low-
est proposed increases from both administra-
tion and Transportation and Parking Advi-
sory Committee (TPAC) proposals.

• Student leaders opposing 
feedeniedre-vote onRIMAC 
By SheIyI Wolcott 
Associate News Editor 

Despite objections voiced by student lead-
etS,the UC Board of Regents voted last Thurs-
day to approve funding for UCSD's contro-
versial Recreaaional/lntramural Athletic and 
Events Center (RlMAC). 

In addition, the finn of Parkin Architects 
was officially named project architect.. 'The 
Los Angeles company has worted over the 
past year with the RIMAC Building Advisory 
committee in developing a tentative design for 
the 533.5 million structure. 

The bulk of the funding for RIMAC is to 
come from $29.5 million in loans, which. due 
to the regents' decision. UCSD now has the 
authority to seek. accOrding to Vice Chancel-
lor of Student Affairs Joseph Watson. 

The university has pledged two million 
dollars from the campus discretionary funds, 
and ·the remaining two million dollars will 
come from students in the fonn of a $70 
quarterly fee, to be implemented upon comple-
tion of the facility in 1994. 

Graduate Student Association (GSA) Presi-
dent Denise Fenton and A sociated Students 
(A.S.) President Agustin Orozco attended the 
regents' meeting in San Francisco to addre s 
concems regarding the student RIMAC quar-
terly fee. 

1bose attending the meeting Ii tened to 
Fenton read a joint letter authored by Fenton. 
GSA Vice President Internal Brian Ladner, 
A.S. representative to the University of CaJi-

" If [the approval of funding] 
goes through, there is not 

very much we can say. 

" AUGusnN OROZCO 
A.S. President 

fornia Student Association (UCSA) John 
Edson. and Lee Butterfield of the U CSA. The 
letter outlines the objections of both student 
government councils to the events center 
project, and asked for a second vote on this 
referendum. 

The student governments have had objec-
tions to RIMAC since a student referendum 
concerning RIMAC passed by a narrow mar-
gin in the spring of 1990. 

Quoting a July, 1991 letter written by UC 
Vice President WiJ1iam R. Frazer, Fenton 
read, ''The establishment or increase of a 
compulsory campu -based fee must be sup-
poned by persuasive evidence that, on the 
whole. the students on the campus favor these

This year, the Guardian is redoubling its efforts to 
represent the diversity of views which characterize chis 
campus. There is no truIh CO any notion that this 
publication prints only that which conforms to the 
political ideology of its editors. 

Difference of opinion is the lifeblood of any college 
paper. These paps are reserved for lively debate.. We 
fail when all we have to offer is just a bunch of quasi· 
intellectuals spewing forth similar philosophies, with 
similar rhetoric, issue after issue, week after week.

the age of 82. A campus memorial 
service is planned for October 14. 
ar ...... 
SenIor Staff Writer 

OnacJoudy summer afternoon. the people who knew 
Roger ReveUc pIbered at the odae of the ocan and bid 
him farewdl. 

They remembered him as a spiriled man who man-
apd to bmnce a respecIed career in the sciences with a 
love forthe humMUties, a world-i-enowned ICientisa who 
moll people simply called "Roaer." 

Roser Randall Dougan Revelle was 82 when he died 
of complicationsofcardiac arresIon July] S. He was the 
man who sugesled Ion& bem anyone else that a 
"Greenhouse Effect" was causing the wmniatg of the 
Earth, was one of the fllSt to study the eanhquake- and 
volcano-causilll movement of earth 's tectonic pIates-
and was the man who spearbcadcd the founding of a 
Univenity of California campus in San Diego. 

Revelle will be remembered here at UCSD on M0n-
day, October 14 at 3:30 p.m. in the new Mandell Weiss 
Forum Theater. The one-hour program will be in~ 
duced by Olanoellor Richard Atkinson. and will feature 
ooeanographer Walter Munk, University of Califomia 
President Emeritus am Kerr, and former Revelle 
student Justin Lancaster, now at Harvard. 

People will be seated on a first come. first served 
basis, so those interested in attending should arrive early . 

The mernoriaI service held by the Scripps Institution 
of <keanognIpby (SIO) four days after Revelle's death 
was not what you might expect upon the death of an 
elderly scienlist - but for Roger Revelle, it seemed 
appropriate. 

Hundreds of people gathered on a lawn near . the 
Scripps Pier and told stories about him, SlKIg songs. and 
reflected on what Revelle loved most in life. 

"I find myself very reluctant to acccpc [Revelle's 
deatH] because there were many, many things that were 
incomplete about my relationship with Roger, and many 
things that I wanted to ask him." saicl SIO director 
Edward Frieman. 

Frieman recaUcda mysterious story titled "The Wolf 
of Gubio" that Revelle had told him on several occa-
sions. 

According to Frieman, Gubio was a harsh medieval 
town. Legend has it that in the 13th century the town was 
terrorized by a gigantic wolf. One day, St Francis came 
to Gubio and encountered the wolf. reproaching it se-
verely for its misdeeds.. The wolf. realizing the evil it had 
done, burst inlO tears. Then, sacrificing its front paw as 
restitulion, the wolf promised to Dl;ver harm anyoncever 
again. Then it died. 

"What did it mean?" Frieman asked rbetoricaIIy. "I 
don't know ... Perhaps it's as it should be." 

Those at the SIO remembrance also raised their

The UCSD Gurdiul 

UCSO will say ioodbye to Roger Revelle in an Oct. 14 
memorial service at the Mandell Weiss Forum. 
voices in tribute to Revelle, singing the folk song 
"Seafarin' Men" and a version of "My Favorite Things" 
whichrevealcd tbatdolphins, Mozan,Adlai Stevenson, 
Woody Allen, and the San Francisco 4gers were 
among Revelle's favorite things. 

Geologist Robert Fisher remembered Revelle as a 
sailor. 

"He had a great love for ships, and respect for those 
who could use them well," Fisher said. "The sound of 
the sea was the first and the last stimuli he received 
each day of his life." 

JeffFrautschy, the former deputy direclor of S[O, 
recalled that Revelle never let his age get in the way of 
his work. 

"Roger knew he was 82. Hejust wouldn't acknowl-
edge it." Frautschy said. "Roger was a young man. In 
our memory. he will a1wllYs be a young man." 

SIO oceanographer Walter Munk recalled a per-
sonal aspect of Revelle that might have initially led 
him to studying the sea 

"Roger wasn't afraid of anything," Munk recalled, 
"except for heights. It was that fear which drove him 
to ... oceanography." 

Munk remembered Revelle's individualistic Hair, 
and his willingness to confront controversy. He re-
called the controversy over the introduction of a 
loyalty oath for all state employees. Revelle vehe-
mently opposed the oath. believing that ideelogy 
should not be a concem in the wortplace. Munk 
recalled one particular occasion when Revelle spoke 
out against the oath, and someone asked him if he was 
a communist "No," he replied. "Why the hell didn't 
you say so?" the person retorted. 

Munk also recalled the lighter side of Revelle. On 
Revelle's SOth birthday, his colleagues hired a famous 
stripper named "Texas Bobbi" as a son of binhday 
surprise. According to Munk, "Bobbi" was carried in 
a Iarp black box. The box wasopeneci,Bobbiemerged. 
and pulled Revelle in with her. 

According to Munk. several of the pany-prs then 
proceeded to cany the box around the block where the

If you're thinking about graduating to the power

help ease the cost. 

Buy any NeXT CPU between August 15 and 
October 31 we'll give you WordPerfec~ the premier 
word processing program, Soft~ the AT-class MS-
DOS-emulator, and Diagram!, the powerful drawing 
and diagramming package, for less than $300. 

That's nearly $1400 worth of software. Software 
you'd probably buy anyway, for less than $300 . 

And since Marllemalica- comes free with every 
NeXT machine sold on college campuses in North 
America, altogether you'll be saving as much as $2000 
on some of our most popular productivity tools. 

And don't forget about the revolutionary computer

a NeXT computer you're moving up to the one 
desktop computer that can carry you through 
college, graduate school, and beyond. 

That's because no other desktop computer 
brings such a full suite of high-performance worksta-
tion features to bear on such a wide range of research, 
analysis, report writing, and problem-solving tasks. 

And no other desktop computer surrounds so much 
performance with the easy-co-use graphical interface 
(and the easy-to-live-with price) of a personal computer. 

So when you purchase a NeXT computer and some 
powerful software, we'll kick in enough savings to help 
pay for (he computer itself. 

After all, if you're bright enough (0 graduate early, 
we wouldn't want a little thing like money to stand in 
your way.

foremost an oc:anographer, but he 
was far more than that. He was

IbM he doesn't give special weighllocertain ques-
tions oyer others. Instead, he and his staff try to use 
the fouIfeen responses on the card to create an 
imaae of the penon who filled iloul, try to uncover 
a clue to their personalities. 

'11', very subjective," Wood says. "For ex-
IIIIpIe.I wouldn't march someone who says they 
w.nbishiY religious with someone who says they 
w.n very accepting of alcohol, because ~'s 
pcobIbIy quite a value conflict there. 

'"We look for responses that suggest connonaI-
ity, rIIher than those that suggest cloning." he 
explain&. In other words, the Warren College staff 
tries 10 march compaIible personalities, not identi-
cal twins. 

RevclIeCol\ege's method of pairing up the 800 
IIUdenIa who will live in their JeSidcnce halls this 
ymris not entirely surprising - they take the high-
tech appoach. Resident Dean Tim Purpura, unlike 

his~atMuirand Warren, was one of the 
tu.1O .lCCeISfully usc the new housin& computer 
I)'IICnlIbal has been installed to work with the new 
ClqJUlwide ISIS computer SYSiem. 

"The new system works the~ or better than 
the computer sySlemS of the J*," PuJl!ura says. 
RevdIe College has been using compuecrs to malCh 
up I'OOII1IDIIteS for nine years. 

The new computei' system, unlike the older 
S)'IIeII1 Wood used 10 match Warren students. 
mIdIea every student it is given. The Warren 
'yllaD wiD only pair people who filled out their 
cards identically. The new system also pairs people 
whole cants are nearly identical, with just a few 
minor variabom in their ~. 

Fifth CoUegeResident Dean Jane Heu also used 
the new system 10 march the approximately &SO 
studeaIS who will live in the college's ~idenoe 
hIDa Ibis year. 

"'Ibis year the computer syslem's been quite 1 
c:haIlen&e. because it's new," Hett says. Next year, 
the system will be used by all five colleges. 

However, boch Purpura and HcU say ... using 
a CCJn1lUIeI' system isn't supposed to be a quantum 
leap in quality, but, rather, is designed 10 make the 

time-consuming job of maaching cards 
easier for both them and their .... 

"I have as many yeaB experiaa 
with marcbinS students by computer as 
by hand," Heu says. "And .... youChe 
truth, I don't mink ~·s mucb differ-
ent in terms of our success rate. But 
[the computer) does save 
time." • , 

The only Revdle 
and Fifth students 
mM:hedby hand are 
those who live inspe-
cialty areas-Revelle's 
BeaaIe Hall is geared coward people 
who want 10 speak differeal 
languages, as are several dif-
ferent suilleS at Afth College. 
In addition, Revelle College 
has a 'health and fitness'-
geaftld floor in Argo Hall, a 
residence hall based around 
community service, and two 
halls which serve as home for trans-
fer SIUdcnIs. 

Because the computer sy5Can is so new, it 
occasionally WOIbd incolm:dy - causing some 
poeenIiaIlyemt.nassinsmors forresidential staffs. 

"The ~ has a map of all our rooms." 
Purpura says. "In some cases, it skipped the map ... 
and, for example, put males in female suites." 

He explained that while his office carches most 
of the errors. the large number of residents at the 
college makes it difficult to ~ them all indi-
vidually. 

"Bue reaDy," PuIpura says. "our problems with 
the new housina computer system are minor com-
pued with the problems studera are having willi 
the new ISIS IystaD. " 

Simplycheckinglfewbundndcardsforgendcr 
wouldn't seem to bea very dif'liculttuk. But what 
compIicaIes the job is the consta'lllychansing flow 
of students. 

"Our occupency... changes every single day

during the summer, and will continue that way 
through the second week of school," he says. 

"As we fill up, the list of possible matches keeps 
chansing. " Wood says. "It does become a bit of a 
nisfttmare· .. 

Some students fail one of their classes during 
their senior year in high school and are not allowed 
to enroll at UCSO. Others may prefer to go to 
another school, and when they are finally allowed 
in, they drop out of UCSO. Purpura says that some 
students decide not to come to UCSO and don', 
noCify his staff of their intentions, leaving a tempo-
rarily empty room. 

A shortage of residents at Revelle prompted 
Purpura to convert two of the 'mudhut' residence 
halls into housing for transfer students from allover 
campus.

The Pre-Communication 
Major is Dead! 

LongUve 
Communication! 

As of FaD 1991 students are no longer required to 
take 8 classes (outside of the major) before becaning 
a Communication major. 

Students wishing to take upper division comrmmica-
tion classes no longer need to take more than the 
Jower division sequence and the specific prerequisites 
for the upper division class. 

The major now consists cif 14 upper division classes 
and two loYJer dMsion classes, Com/Gen 20 and 21 
(the latter wiD have basic elements of video combined 
with theory.) 
Those pre-communication majors that have com-
pleted VISUal Arts 70 will need to petition VA 70 to 
count for Com/Gen 21. 

Com/Gen 100 will be a required course for anyone 
wishing to enroll in any upper division production 
class. 

There is an information briefing scheduled for Friday, 
September 27th at 11:00 a.m. on the patio of MCC 
to answer any questions you have about these 
changes. 

You may also contact Gregory Griffin, the Student 
Services Coordinator in the department.

"At that point, we usually ask

All the deans emphasized that 
studentS are rarely used to living in 
close proximity to someone who is

Gender DiHerences: 
The Impact of Environment and ~iology 
on Human Development 
This course will draw on the reseorch and theories from several 
disciplines in the biological and social sciences. The approach is 
different from others in this field in that it is an integration, rather 
than simply a compilation, of the information .that has been available, 
but scahered, because of the multi-disciplinary approaches. The 
primary format for this synthesis is a different description of male and 
female development from conception through adulthood. The current 
understanding of the contributions of, a.nd interactions between, 
environment and biology during this developmental period will be 
discussed .

or sell property to Jews. In addition 
10 baalina the lOli-semitic covenant 
of La Jolla ral CSIIIe, Revelle cre-
&led a new subdivision for Scripps 
profasors. partWly because some 
of them would not have been al-
lowed to live in La Jolla. 

,"He was a major leader in the 
sense that he had 111 enormous vi-
sion of what could be accom-
plished." Frieman said. "His ability 
to ponray what a future university 
could become -out of a few sinall 
buildings - was amazing." 

In Revelle's last years. he con-
tinued 10 work and teach. He tauJht 
two undergraduate courses every 
year. The hean attack Revelle had 
last year forced him to move the 
course to SIO from the Revelle Col-
lege provost's office, but he contin-
ued to teach it. 

According to Revelle College 
Provost Tom Bond. Revelle had a 
special fondness for students. 

"AtReveIIeCoI\ege graduations. 
Roger would always insist that he 
shake the hand of every graduate," 
Bond said. 

Though UCSD's first college 
bears Revelle's name, there an: no 
buildings ormonumentson the cam-
pus that bear his name. 

"Every time we uie<! 10 put up a 
monument with his name on it," 
Bond said. "Now thai he's gone, 
I'm su~ thai we will find some way 
to honor him. " 

DcspifieaD Revelledid forUCSD, 
chances IR good thai he will be 
remembered most for his contribu-
tion 10 the study of global wanning. 

"Intcmalionally, as viewed from 
Mongolia - well, nobody in 
Mongolia has heIrd of UCSD," 
Frieman said. "But they have heard 
oftbe 'Greenhouse Effect.' A bun-

~ years from now, when the text-
books are written, they'll list him 
among the leaders in dial research. 

"Roger's work on die 'Green-
house Effect' will be remembered 
long after the buildings aI UCSD 
have cnunblcd. " he said. 

In the wodc being done on lhe

just to name a few. 

"]t is not our intent to be political 
[in the support groups]," Giebink 
said. "Our job is merely to take care 
of the psychological needs people 
may have." 

Giebink noted that therearemany 
cultural conflicts cenain students 
face when they are just entering the 
universiry. "We try to help these 
students bridge thegapbetween their 
culture and the academic world," 
Giebink explained. 

The focus groups are more issue-
centered. According to Giebink. 
there are over 30 focus groups, deaI-

Psychological Services also has 
a program where students counsel

are peer counselors for alcohol and 
substance abuse, gay/lesbianlbi-
sexual support groups, and women's 
needs. 

"People of a college age are in 
transition, "Giebink explained. "It's 
a process of individuation. Some 
people may havedifficulry with that 
process." 

"Some people come to college 
thinking all of their problems will 
disappear and everything will get 
better," he said. "Sometimes they 
don't Sometimes their problems 
only get aggravated. " 

UCSD is a relatively high-stress

add to the stress," he said. But, he

The college sySlCm is primarily 
modeled after the universities of 
Oxford and Cambridge in England. 
But in crossing the Atlantic and 
North America, there were a few 
changes. 

UCSO's colleges are more indi-
vidual than the colleges at UC Santa 
Cruz, which serve little purpose be-
yond on-campus housing - but 
they're a far cry from the system as 
it exists in England. 

The original plan was 10 have 
faculty members tied to each col-
lege-but sinceprofcssors seem to 
prefer dealing with people within 
their own disciplines, departments 
became a stronger bond than col-
lege affiliation. So UCSO's under-
graduate colleges are divided by 
geography, on-campus housing. and 
general education requirements . 

But within that relatively small 
range of differences, there's a lot of 
diversity. Most UCSDstudents(per-

Tripped Up at the Start 
• 1-0 OT loss to CSUSB 
drops men's soccer to 
worst start since 1982

Sports Editor _ 

Derek Annstrong stalked angrily 
off the field, leaving his team mill-
ing around the sidelines behind him 
to contemplate its 1-0 double over-

0.. ~a...- time loss to CSU San Bernardino 
Sergio Salvador entered the game Friday afternoon. As he marched 
as a substitute In the second half. toward the locker room he flipped 

the remaining wateroutofhis boule 
in disgust and then paused, glancing 
back at the field as if pondering the 
fates that had brought his Tritons to 
a 3-3 record - their worst stan 
since he took over the program in 
1982. 

A historian of the UCSD men' 
soccer tearn would probably excuse 
the head coach for going into a bii of 
a funlc. After all, he finds himself in 
very unfamiliar tenitory. Last year.

Pepperdine Outlasts Tritons 11-9 
• Waves come out on top in an 
early season showdown of top 10 
teams in men's water polo 
By Robin Maclean 
SenIor Slaff Writer 

If UCSD Head Coach Denny Harper i 
correct, this year's men's water polo team 
could prove to be something pecial. 

According to Harper, the Tritons are cur-
rently playing at only 70 percent, due in part to 
intense training and weight conditioning. 

Harper's knowledge that the 10th-ranked 
Tritons are not yet in top fonn made Saturday's 
11-9 loss to Pepperdine a little easier to bear. 

TIle Waves are currently ranked sixth in the 
nation. and, according to at least one expert 
(Harper, whoelse?).couldchallenge top-ranked 
Cal for the national title this year. 

Harper came away from the contest pleased 
with his team's perfonnance, choosing to focus 
on the team's improvementoverthe beginning 
of the season, rather than the actual game. 

Some of this improvement may be due in 
part to returning seniorredshirts Jason "Turtle" 
Brown (a 1989 All-American) and Greg 
Goodrich, both of whom add experience as 
well as talent to the roster. 

Saturday, the Tritons stayed close through-
out, but were unable to overcome the Waves. 

After falling behind 2-0 early in the first 
0.. _Gc.dir> quarter, Goodrich scored to bring UCSD within 

UCSD (front) swamped Loyola Marymount 15-3 (above), but fell to sixtlHanked Pepperdine 11·9. See W. POLO, Page 911

It's good to be the king - or 

queen. 
Take, for instance, this sam-

pting of quoles from UCSD 
woaaa', volleyt.U Head Coach 
Dous Dlmevilt - leader of the 
defendin, Division m NCAA 
nationII championI. and wimer

"Our pnctices 8Je often more 
competitive than our pmes. " 

"We ... runanotJense so much 
IDORsophisticated tt. the IC8ms 
wc're plaYina." 

.... We·re stronger and more 
pnysical than the other Division 
m teams right now." 

That just gives you an idea of 
whallife at the top can be like. In 
fact, the Tritons often have to go 
to exrrernes to find some com~ 
tilion. 

For instance. of rhe Tritons' 
cwo losses in II matches, one 
came against 20th-ranked San 
Diego Stare. Uh, that's 20Ih in 
Division I . 

1be other came to founh-

ranli:ed Cal State Bakersfield Vb, 
that·s founh in Division U. 

In fact, atone point this season 
UCSD traveled to Cal for a pre-
season tournament with just Di-
vision I and IT opponents. Along 
the way, the Tritons decided to 
stop and scrimmage Sian/or(/] 
Of course they got waxed. but as 
Dannevik said. "It was funjuslto 
go up there."

Whether or not higher powen

Glee GoodrIch led • late rally with 
two &o8ISand a sensational assist. 

W.POLO 
one. 

On anotherday,lhe sccondquar-
termighrhave been the turning point 
of the game,,, the the Waves scored 
twice more before UCSO WIUI able 
to retaliate. The Tritons responded 
by ripping ofT four straight goals to 
lake the lead. 

Butlhis early in Ihe season, the 
Tritons wereclearly not yet ready to 
kick it into high gear. With one 
minute left in the half, the Waves 
scored again to tie Ihe game. Sec-
onds laIer lhey netted another to 
regain the lead at the half 6-S. 

Pepperdine carne out of Ihe gate 
fasl in the third quarter, scoring an 
early goal to go up by two. But 
UCSO's Mite Naludrew afoul and 
senior Jay Hagan converted Ihe 4-
meter penalry shot to bringlhe Tri-
tons wilhin one. 

The end of the third quarter 
proved to be Ihe turning point of the 
game, as UCSO WIUI unable to capi-
talize on two Peppentine ejections 
and instead ended up surrendering 
two goals arxI fell behind 9-6. 

Converting in man-up situations 
has been a sore spot for the Tritons, 
according to Harper. This inabiliry 
to execute was particularly impor-
tant in light of the large nwnber of 
Pepperdine ejections. 

Paced by Goodrich, the Tritons 
made a lasr-ditch comeback in che 
fourth quarter. Goodrich scoftd to 
close the game to 9-7. 

Bullhe Waves took advantIF 
of a Ooodrich ejection -the only 
UCSO ejection of the game - 10 
score twice apd extend lheir lead to 
11-7. 

The Tritons made il close in the 
end when Gary Seelhorst convened 
a sensational pass from Goodrich to 
cut the lead 10 thrce. Goodrichadded 
anolher with just 3] seconds left in 
Ihe game 10 close out Ihe scoring. 

The loss carne on the heels of the 
Tritons' 15-3 win over a decidedly-
outmatched Loyola MaJymount 
squad. Still, Harper w.. more 
pleased wim the team's play SIIur-
day, than the first half of Ihe LMU 
game when the Tri~ played slug-
gishly. 

According to Harper the team 
should be stuting to peak within 
two weeks - just in time for the 
CaIemont TOUJ1IM1eIII where the 
Tritons wiD meet up with some old 
riv .... includina Brown and ninth-

. As a result, UCSO'sJeny Schwartz 
finished 2151 (second among the

Another fIctor was the high hu-
midity, a weaIber condition almost

The humidty may have caused the

"We came ow real agrasive. At

where I thought we should be, but 
we just aren't ready to race yet," 
Stanforth said. 

"At th~ point in the season, our

The men's and women's results 
were in stark contrast to the Tritons'

finished 19 points behindSUU with

four of the top five fmishers in that

Revelle's rqJU1IIion is one thai 
revolves around'1Citnce and enJi-
ncering majors, mostly hrcause 0( 
the coJ\eae's science and math re-
quirernelllS. Revelle's large number

some lifted eyebrows among stu-
dents from other collegea. As 
Revelle College offICials say, their

COueGE 
CanIIi .......... asa 
CoIIcae has remained wid! I num-
ber for a name lnOIIIy due to its 
tumultuous past. Originally envi-
sioned as a history-based colIep. a 
group of students rose to by and 
take control of the coIlcF'sdclliny. 
While their demands to renamo the 
college "Lumwnba-Zapala" were 
not met. the college was altered to 
become one focusing on ethnic di-
versity and social issues. To this 
day, Third still sbnds apan in its 
focuses and rcquinmcnts. This year, 
Third has inaugwatcd a new core 
course, "Dimensions of Culture." 

Attempts to finally give Third 
College a new name have repeat-
edly been defeated. Last year, it 
seemed as if it would be renamed 
"King College," after slain civil 
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. 
But King's family chose to work 
toward creating· a King College of 
theirown in the South. Though some 
students still feel the need tochange 
Thint's name, it seems that Thint 
may be Third for a long time to 
come. And after all these years, the 
word "Third" has acquired a special 
meaning all its own. It's no longer 
just a number. 

UCSO's founh college, founded 
in the mid- '70s, is Warren College. 
Warren students have to explore 
completely different fields of study 
- all must have I major and two 
minors, each being in noncontiguous 
subjects. This means that all Warren 
students must take at least six courses 
in the sciences, social sciences, and 
humanities. These requirements 
make Warren students some of the 
most broadly educated students on 
campus. 

Due to its far-flung \ocalion and 
the fact that it houses all its on-
campus students in apartments, 
Warren seems III times to be an _ 
"invisible" college. But as the ceo-
lerof campus moves closer to War-
ren, and as plans continue to build 
residence halls and a cafeteria be-
hind the Warren Apartments, War-
ren may go from being "invisible" 
to being in the center of it all. 

Begun in the fall of 1988, FIfth 
College is UCSD's newest college. 
It is also its smaI1est - but like all 
new colleges at UCSD, it will no 
doubl pow in time. In 1Iddition, 
Fifth is likely to have anew name by 
the end of the year. This is the year 
that Fifth's first class will graduate. 
and Fifth College Provost Jamie 
Lyon has said thai he'd like them 10 
gradualefrom acollegewithaname. 
Fifth 5Iudents who bave grown ac-
customedtolhelWllCshouldn'tfear, 
though - anyone who ~t to the 
college while it was named "Fifth" 
wiU still be able to have thai appear 
on their diplomas. 

Because of its relative yo.uth. 
Fifth hasn't pined as iiM:h of a 
reputaIion a the ocher c:oUeges at

Giebink pointed to a survey of 
recent UCSD graduares which asked 
them what they learned in college 
which helps them jnost in "the real 
wodd.. It One of the top answers, 
according to Giebink, was coping 
with SU'CsS. 

"College can be a very suessful 
time. But it is also a time for great 
development. well,"Giebinksaid.

"The organizations are meant to 
be separatist, but not to the exclu-
sion of anyone else," he explained. 
"Anyone inlaested in or COIiCCilllcd 
with issues affecting that popula-
tion are invited to help." 

Jemison said that the 0rganiza-
tions serve to acclimale students to 
the UCSD environment. 

"It can be a big help to new 
students," Jemison said. '"1bey ... 
help students become comfortable 
in 'the UCSD climare, and then the 
students may branch out into the 
larger campus community. These 
organizations provide the opportu-
nity for a fmn footing in whi<:h to 
base a c:onncction [widTUCSD)." 

He also explained that !he orp-

point -venae· 

"We've lOla very liberal drop 
policy - up to !he niIIIh week of 
cia&," Bond said. "That's wry li~ 
eraI. Other UC schools feel we'm 
too soft." 

In addition, Bond said thai the W 
is not the black madt on the trail-
saipl that some studenrs feel it is. 

'"The W is not inrended 10 be a 
penalty," he explained. "It just indi-
cates you were in a coune.. and 
wirhdrew from iL My own IICIIIC is 
that one or two W's CXI a student·s 
record will be vinually ignored. 

One way to avoid beinS mistak-
enly enrolled or mistakenly not en-
rolled in acoune is by checking·the 
course confinnaIion fonn that is 
sent out to all sludenrs early in the 
quarter, Bond said. 

"You're respons.ible foryourreg-
istration," he said. "You're resp0n-
sible for mistakes. " 

This quarter, students have 
through Oct. 11, the end of the sec-
ond week of classes, to add new 
classes 10 their schedule. They may 
c:hanaetheirgradingoption between 
pa&S/not pus through the end of the 
fourth week, Oct. 23. 

When students are worried about 
doing !heir classwork, meeting new 
people, and dealing with !he little 
problems thal always seem to crop 
up, deadlines seem toapproach with 
little warning. A mninder on a cal-
endar may be the best way to malee 
sure that your transcripl (or wallet. 
in !he case of late fee payments) 
doesn't become impacted by a sim-
ple memory 1ap5C. 

"In education, we emphasise the 
dme R' 5 as being reading, writing, 
and arithmetic," Bond said.. "When 
it comes to deadlines, we empha-
size another dme R ·s."
