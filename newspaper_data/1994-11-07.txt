MUD-SUNGING 
CANDIDATES 

BATTLE OVER A 
DIVIDED STATE 

••• pag. · 01 

The '94 elections have proven to be. one of the most bitter in California's history. High-profile Democratic and Republican candidates have 
poured millions into their campaigns not 
to bring their message to the masses, but 
to discredit their opponents. They 've 
mastered the art of slinging mud. 

But the conflict goes much deeper than 
simple politicking. Proposition 187, the 
so-called "Save Our State" initiative, has 
divided the state and is likely to bring a 
number of otherwise non-voting citizens 
into the election process - a major 
watershed for Democrats . 

By all counts, tomorrow's elections 
are extremely important- its results will 
extend far beyond the next four years.

Prop 187 
Target of 
Protest 
ELECTION: Students dressed 
as Border Patrol agents check 
IDs at door to lecture hall 
By Elizabeth Mackenzie 
Staff Writer 

Members of the Coalition Against Racism 
(CAR) set up a mock citizenship checkpoint in 
front of Warren Lecture Hall Thursday morning 
in protest of Proposition 187. 

The demonstration was an effort to illustrate 
the possible effects of Proposition 187, accord-
ing to event organizer and Muir senior Siamak 
Malek. "This is not necessarily a pro or con 
view. It depends if you like showing your ID," 
Malek said. 

Dressed as Border Patrol agents, members of 
CAR demanded proof of American citizenship 
from students bCfore they were allowed to enter 
the lecture hall. 

Birth certificates, passports and Social Secu-
rity cards accompanied by two forms of picture 
identification were acceptable forms of proof of 
citizenship. 

If Proposition 187 is approved by California 
voters tomorrow, illegal immigrants will be 
ineligible to attend public schools, including the 
University of California. In 1992, the Univer-
sity of California was uncertain of the residency 
status of 362 of its students. 

Nick Endres, a participant in the protest who 
was dressed in black with a Border Patrol 
armband said the purpose of the checkpoint was 
to get people to think about Proposition 187. 

"Proposition 187 is tantamount to slavery. It 
allows people to work here and have no rights," 
Endres added. 

First-year Muirstudent Damian Carroll, who 
was stopped at the checkpoint, said. "I think [the 
protestors are] absolutely right. This is what 
California will turn into. Proposition 187 will 
hurt the character and morality of California for 
decades to come." 

Proposition 187, the so-called "Save Our 
State" (SOS) initiative, would deny public edu-
cation and non-emergency health care to illegal

"We have seen in the last three

systemwide. " 

Enrollment fluctuations ' are

cus, four straw polls were taken, and 
the council was unanimously in fa-

ing an effort to increase enroll-
ments," he added 

According to UC President Jack 
Peltason, the UC is making 
systemwide efforts to increase en-
rollment, especially that of first-
year students. 

The projected enrollment for 
first-year studtnts in the UC sys-
tem this year is 22,000, which 
would be the largest entering class 
to date. The previous record of 
21,825 students was set in 1988. 

Peltason said that the change in 
UCenrollment policy isa result of 
a four percent increase in state 
funding to the UC system. 

"'We are thankful that the legis-
lature and the governor were able 
to provide a small increase in state 
funds for this academic year," 
Peltason said. 

"'It signals that education is a 
priority at a time of extraordinary 
fiscal difficulty. We hope that the 
California recession is over so that 
we can begin planning at all levels 
of higher education for the 800,000 
additional students who will be 
seeking access to postsecondary 
cduadion by 2010," Pelllwn added. 

According to Backer, UCSD is 
also looking to increase its enroll-
ment.

UCSD Tears Up Panthers 
SEASON FINALE: Tritons handle visiting Chapman in three games to 
wrap up regular-season at 25,6; will host NCAA Regionals this weekend 
By Den KNIt 
Co-Sports Editor 

Like a sprinter whO wants to fin· 
ish the race strong. the UCSD 
women's volleybalileam had noth-

ing less than 
a resounding 
victory in 
mind when it 
strode into 
the Main 
Gymnasium 
on Friday 
night to facc 
off against 
Chapman 
University. 
The Panthers 
were the Tri-

tons' final hurdle of the season as 

UCSD gears up for the NCAA Di· 
vision III Playoffs which will begin 
next weekend. With hopes of host· 
ing the playoffs still strong, the Tri-
tons didn't want to give the NCAA 
selection committee any reason to 
deny them the opportunity - and 
they certainly didn't offer one, as 
they pummeled Chapman in straight 
sets (15·9,15·12,15-5). 

UCSD wasted no time asserting 
itself in the opening game of the 
contest as it sprinted to a 9·2 advan-
tage, The Tritons then suffered a 
lapse of concentration, allowing the 
Panthers to come roaring back with 
seven straight points to knot the 
match at nine. 

"We lost some of our momentum 
in the first game," Head Coach 

MedeIyn RI ................ M.e __ In the win OY., CMpmen • 

Doug Dannevik said. "Chapman 
played a very slow pace and it was 
tough for us to play our game." 

With tlfe Panthers threatening to 
pull into the lead, UCSD snapped 
back to life and reeled off six con· 
secutive points of its own to tally 
the victory in game one. 

The second game saw Chapman 
regain some of the momentum it had 
built in ;ts game-one comeback. 
Early on, the Panthers grabbed the 
lead and forced Dannevik to use a 
timeout, 

After a tough battle, Chapman 
found itself on top again late in the 
game at 12-10. However, the Pan· 
thers 'luck quickly ran out when tbe 
Tritons awoke and recorded a five-
point streak to win the second game 
and take a solid lead in the match. 

"We did exactly what we had to 
do," Dannevik said. "I think some 
of the seniors were a little tight be-
cause of the senior farewell between 
games two and three, but they 
calmed down in the third game." 

Calm may not be the word for it, 
but the whipping that the Tritons 
laid on Chapman in the final game 
was ·severe. The team as a whole 
tallied a .56S hitting percentage en 
route to a commanding 9'(} lead. 
After suffering a brief lapse which 
allowed the Panthers a glimmer of 
hope, UCSD turned the lights out 
with another six-point run to close 
out the contest. 

"We were always in control," 

Chuck NCurenl Gunf.n 
Julie Hervey billed 11 kill. In the Trtton.' victory over Chapman • 
Dannevik said. "We got sort of un- Defensively, Crochet was the 
focused when we got leads, but we leader with 12 digs, followed by 
played solidly and had a lot of fun." Schofield with 11 digs and Harvey 

Outside hitter Angelle Crochet who managed to scoop up 10 balls. 
paced tbe Tritons' offensive on- The Tritons will begin the play-
slaught with IS kills, while sehior offs next weekend when tbey bost 
Julie Harvey returned to form by the NCAA Division ttl Western 
smashing home 11 kills. Regionals Friday and Saturday . 

Senior setter Jennifer Schofield UCSD will have a rematch with 
continued her strong, late· season Chapman on Friday and will play 
performance, setting up teammates the winner of tbe Cal Lutheran -
to the tune of 42 assists. Occidental rontest.

. testors that argued against the use 
of the Minuteman for the Univer-
sity of Massachussetts, because it's 
a sexist symbol or the Cowboy for 
the Dallas football tesm, because it 
perpetuates a stereotype. 

Which brings me to question 
number two: Is anyone happy with 
their mascot in the sporting world? 

I mean, you go to the World Se-
ries two years in-a-row and all some 
people care about is that your mas-
cot is a Brave. 

I still don't know exactly what a 
Triton is, but that doesn't mean that 
I'm going to write in and complain 
that its trident resembles some guy's 
tallywhacker. 

Perhaps the worst part about this 
whole University of Kentucky de-
bacle is that the school is actually 
going to change it. No write-in cam-

UCSD Makes Waves in 17-16 Loss 
PSYCHIC: Harper predicts win over top-ranked Stanford ne~t Friday night 
., ...... K. Hutto 
Senior sr." WrIter 

The lIth-unked Triton men's 
water polo squad is growing weary 
of merely eaming the polo world's 

respect. After 
suffering bitter 
losses to sev-
eral of the 
nation's elites 
including 
UCLA (11-9), 
USC (11-9), 
UCSB (8-7), 
UC Irvine (6-
5), last Satur-
days' gut-
wrenching 17-
16 home de-

feat to fourth-ranIced Pepperdine, 
left Head Coach Denny Harper a 
frustrated man. 

"I'm pretty sick of moul victo-
ries," Harper said. "We're way be-
yond moral victories by now. It's 
brutal. Pepperdine spent most of the 
game wondering, 'What in the hell 
is going on here; who are these 
guys?' I think theircoac:hes wanted 
to start bitching to the refs, but they 
were forced to deal with the fact that 
the game had nothing to do with 
how it was called. We're just a damn 
fine water polo team." 

From the opening sprint, the Tri-
tons had upset in their sights. Se-
nior hole-set James Skaalen was a 
burr in the Waves' suit all night. 
When he wean't dismantling tbe 
Waves' defense, Sbalen (six goals, 
eight points) un the UCSD offense 
like the conduc:tor of the San Diego 
Pbilarmonic, setting up Micbael 
Yallech and Gregory Salvinski on 
bac:k-to-back ac:orea to give the Tri-
tons a 3-2 first quarter lad. 

But Pepperdine's Devin Hurst 
struck quickly for two scores in the 
second quarter, and it appeared the 
mighty Waves would DIn away from 
their over-achieving foes. Harper 
would have nothing of it, demand-
ing a time out to set his team stmigIL 

Slcaalen responded, lobbing a 
long two-pointer which trickled past 
Waves' keeper Nathaniel Mulhern 
to put UCSD back on top, 5-4. 

Relentless defense and intensity 
fueled the Triton attack, and San 
Diego surged to a 7-S advantage on 
Carlos De La Barra '5 skip shot from 
the right wing on one ofthe Tritons 
numerous man-up situations. Yet the 
Tritons, in aU their zeal, failed where 
the water polo elites must prosper: 
taking advantage of the lucky breaks 
to put away the game. 

Craig GDlber's steal just before 
the half might have propelled 
UCSD into uncharted winning wa-
ters, but tbe Tritons fell short, cling-
ing to an 8-6 halftime spread. 

Pepperdine chipped away in the 
third quarter, tying the score 8-8 on 
Hurst's man-up conversion, but 
UCSD countered with a resounding 
two-pointer from Teague Soderman. 

Salvinski padded the margin, 11-
8, blasting a rifle shot from the right. 
wing on yet another six-on-five 
play, and later assisted Skaalen's 
tap-in score from the left post with 
30 seconds in the quarter to push the 
tally to 13-10 in favor of UCSD. 

But lady unluc:k struck again, as 
Soderman's two-point launch from 
near half-tank in the waning seconds 
of the third period careened off the 
right post as the hom BOunded. 

A IS-10 Iwt going into the fi-
nal quarter might have done it, but 
the see-saw battle for supremacy 

aeen mI telcviaion 

began anew, and with 2S seconds 
remaining, the rivals were knotted 
at 16. Unfortunately, UCSD 
c:racked, wmmitting a costly turn-
over trying to feed Skaalen in the 
hole. The Waves' Alan Herrman 
made the Tritons pay with a turn-
around skip shot from the two-meter 
position, putting Pepperdine up 17-
16, as the game clock struck :06. 

And yet, a glimmer of hope re-
mained. The Waves' keeper was 
called for stalling the game after 
Skaalen '5 desperation lob-shot 
sailed over the cage and UCSD was 
awarded the ball. With three Tritons 
camped a mere two feet from a wide 
open net, the capacity crowd 
screamed with glee, but a rushed 
shot by De La Barra slammed into 
the cross bar as the hom sounded, 
ending the briiliant battle. 

"You don't give the ball up in 
your own pool with 25 seconds 
left," Harper said. "But aside from 
the loss this WIS great for the cam-
pus and great for this program. 
There were people out there who 
just wrote us off this year, saying 

• we were red-shirting all of our stars 
and didn't take us to be anything. I 
wonder where those people are now. 
I think this is the best team we've 
had since 1989, and I don't like to 
compare teams. This is au amazing 
group that can play with anyone. 

"I think we're"just building this . 
one up to IaIock off the number~ne 
team in the nation. Tell the whole 
campus, we are going to beat the 
team that is head and shoulders 
above everybody else right DOW. 
Ream ... your schedules, because 
next Friday night [when UCSD 
faces Staaford) the nation is in for 
one hell of a pme," Harper said.

14 SPORTS 

M. SOCCER: 
Top TIgers, Gusties to 
advance to quarters 
ContInued from .... 18 
highly favorable odds that UCSD is 
peaking when it counts. 

Colorado ColIege learned the 
hard way. San Diego stormed the 
Tigers' defense from the get-go, 
netting all three of their goals in the 
first half. 

With 22:32 elapsed, UCSD 
worked one of its potent offensive 
set-plays to perfection. Junior full-
back Nick Terlecky hurled a blister-
ing throw-in from the right sideline 
to Chilton, who was cutting toward 
Colorado's right post Leaping high 
above his defender and nicking the 
ball just out of the reacb of charg-
ing Tiger goalkeeper Doug Bow-
man, Cbilton head flicked the balI 
back to an unmarked Erik W!lldman 
stationed at the far-left post. 
Waldman's subsequent tap in to a 
wide-open net put UCSD up to stay, 

1~. 

Senior Todd Curran added an 
insul1UlCC score at 34:38. Fresbman 
Shayne Ferber controlled the ball on 
the left side of the Tiger '5 goalie bolt 
when he saw Chilton sprinting for 
the left end line. Ferber quickly 
tapped it to Chilton, who immedi-
atel y blasted a perfect cross to a 
breakaway Curran in front of the 
cage. Bowman didn', have a prayer 
as Curran directed his shot just to 
the right ofthe diving keeper to up 
UCSD's margin to 2~. 

Fiuingly, Chilton himself re-
corded San Diego's final talIy at 
40:57. A long open-field clear by 
TerJecky found three Tritons, in-
cluding senior Robert Ripley, Ferber 
and Chilton, bunched on the upper-
left side of the Tiger's goalie box 
with only one defender still in tbe 
running. Chilton snared the ball and 
unleasbed a rocket left-footed 
screamer from IS-yards out to the 
upper-rigbt-hand comer of the net 
to conclude the affair, 3~. 

Wbile the offense wu draining 
shots on its side, UCSD's always-
stauncb defense more than amply

. The UCSD Guardiaa 

held up its end of the bargain. Se-
nior Mike Yen, sopbomore Jay 
Newcomer and junior Ken Bums 
along with Terlec~y and Cbilton 
stifled every Tiger counterattack. 

In particular, Terlecky hounded 
Colorado's main-scoring threat, 
Arron Lujan (13 goals, 37 points), 
not allowing him a shot on goal un-
til less tban four minutes remained. 
Triton sopbomore goalie George 
Allison posted his eighth shutout of 
the season. 

"No one came out witb butter-
flies," Chilton said. "At least it 
didn't show on the field. We treated 
this like just another game, no one 
choked and everything clicked. Our 
defense wu excellent and (Allison] 
smothered some hard shots in the 
cage. I don't see many goals being 
scored on this defelllC. " 

The results of round two of the 
playoffs were equally u pleuing 
for the Tritons. Gustavus Adolphus 
advanced with a 1-0 win over 
Claremont Mudd Scripps (15-3-1) 
on Saturday to recall lut year's 
memorable first-round rematch loss 

w. SOCCER: 
Beat Pointers 3-1 to 
reach Final Four 
CGntInued ......... 18 
off tbe opening kick as teammate 
Dawn Lee boomed a pass from deep 
in her own half. The ball sailed over 
the Warriors and landed midway 
between the sweeper and goal-
keeper, both of whom assumed the 
other would take it. Johnson flew 
put the sweeper, picked up the ball 
and beat keeper Nikki Johnson to 
score the game '5 only goal, five sec-
onds into the contest. 

The Tritons did have another 
opportunity about 2S minutes into 
tbe second half when St. Mary's 
Katie Kortsch chopped down Triton 
Carin Pugh from behind, u Pugh 
headed toward tbe goal on a 
breakaway. Kortsch wu red-carded 
and tossed from the game,. and Lee 
took the ensuing penalty Itick, but 
her shot went wide left. Pugh hurt 
her ankle on the play and was ques-
tionable for Sunday's game but 
manapd to suit up and play. 

It wu a low-scoring game but 
not for a lack of opportunitiea. "We 
dominated most of the game," 
UCSD Head Coach Brian 
McManus said. "They bad a couple 
of good cbances, but we hit the 
croubu a couple of times." 

to UCSD. Both squads played to a 
0.0 tie, but the Tritonllhatterecl the 
Guatiea' hopes after DOW-graduated 
senior atris Romey pocketed the 
final penalty Idck. 

Witb their bearts beot 00 re-
venge, Gustavus Adolphus stepped 
up its game. Although the Tritons 
nearly scored on their fint posses~ 
sion only 40 seconds into the first 
half, the Gusties quickly and effec-
tively baited most ofUCSD's offeo-
sive efforts at midfield for the re-
mainder of the half. 

Armstrong inserted Joel 
KosaIroff, who, wheo healthy, bas 
been likened to "the team's quarter-
back," to jump start the Tritons' of-
fense, but the 1ess-tban-l00- percent 
midfielder collapsed in pain after 
attempting to drive a erossing pus 
and appears to be lost for the year. 

"They were a good team, give 
them credit; they were aggressive 
aod they hustled," Chilton said. 
"They did a great job slowing us 
down, and I think we were a little 
tired from [the Colorado] game. But 
in the second half, our forwards tore 
them apart. " 

Indeed they did. Only] 1:49 into 
the second baIf, Chilton sent a long 
cross from the 
midfield over to 

. Hetherington on 
the right sideline. 
Hetherington 
knew what to do 
from there, badly 
burning both 
Gusty defenders 
Vince Brama and 
Andy Hemenway 
to the punch, drill-
ing a cross to the 
middle of the 
goalie box. A late-
surging Curran 
couldn't track the 
grounder down, 
but 5 '2" sopbo-
more midfielder 
Jose Ocampo bar-
reled into the sub-
sequent melee, 
netting Gusty Pe-
ter Beck's weak 
deflection into the

cap to Jive UCSD al~ advantap. 
Triton forward KeD Christopher 
~jii allo got into the scoring act at 
64:13. Newcomer spotted 
Hetherington in the middle, about 
30 yards away from the Gustavus 
Adolphus cage. The sophomore 
beaded the long pus to a wi~n 
Fujii on the left side. Fujii juiced to 
the inside, faked left and moved 
right, leaving Gusty defender Drama 
in a daze and drawing out Gusty 
keeper David Graham. Once he wu 
sure of the angle, Fujii booted a 
grounder into the far-right comer of 
the cage to increase the Triton lead 

to2~. 
"They really zoned in on Chilton 

and Terleclty, which showed they 
scouted us pretty good." Annstrong 
said. "We played 10 well yesteiday. 
They knew they had to play a big 
game today to come close to us. 
They played very well, but it is dif-
ficult for any team to hold us for 90 
minutes. Witb Hetberington and 
Fujii out there, they are going to 
opeo you up." 

What bas opened up most is 
UCSD's c:bances of maltins another

The Tritons outsbot the Wuriors, 
14-8, and took ]0 corners, compared 
to one for St. Mary '5. 

"The field wu very slick and so 
it came down to a case of who was 
going to make the least number of' 
mistakes," McManus said. With the 
win, the Tritons eamed the right to 
play Wisconsin-Stevens Point in 
yesterday'S final. But McManus 
wu not ready to celebrate on Sat-
urday. "Stevens Point looks really 
good," he said. "They've got good 
strength in their midfield and have 
four or five players that are bead and 
shoulden above us in size. We may 
just have to pull something out of a 
hat." 

The only thing the coach needed 
his hat for 00 Sunday wu too keep 
warm. The host Pointers took a ]..() 
lead 26:53 seconds into the contest 
when Janie Probst took an Erin 
Leinweber feed and converted on a 
lucky bounce off her toe. But the 
Tritons were not impreued. ·We 
dominated the tint half, to McManus 
said. "They got the goal, but I don't 
think that's the way she wu look-
ing to score. At halftime, even the 
playen were saying that we bad 
notbing to worry about." 

UCSD overran Stevens Point in 
the second balf. Seven minutea af-
ter the intermiuion, lee rifled a 
corner Itick in jUl' the right spot for 
teammate Diana Mucbowski, who 

rocketed in a header before anyone, 
especially Pointer keeper Savonte 
Walker, had time to move. 

Mucbowski struck again, just 
three minutes later. UCSD's Carrie 
Peer took the ball up the right side-
line before crossing it in front of the 
goal. Walker dove for the .. II and 
tapped it out to a group of three 
Pointen and Muchowslti. The jun-
ior calmly took the ball away and 
slipped it into the comer of tbe net 
to give the Tritons a 2-1 lead. 

The Tritons capped off the scor-
iag when Peer collected her second 
.. ill, this time putting up a cross 
from the right side. FJe Jobnlon wu 
there and bent over to head the 
chest-high pass just inside the near 
poll for a two-goal UCSD edge. 

"We were worried about their 
midfield Saturday night so we bad 
talked about cbanging our 
gameplan. But yesterday moming 
we just said forget it. Brandie 
Hayungs and Amanda Jobnson 
played terrifically and won the 
midfield for Ia," the ooacb said. 

Now the Tritons will try to cap-
ture their fint title since 1989. 
UCSD will face sixth-ranked North 
Carolina Wesleyan (15-2-3) Satur-
day at 1:30 p.m. The other two 
teams, second-ranked Trenton State 
(20-1) and 17th-ranked SUNY-
GeIIIIeO (19-3-1) will battle it out 
at 11 a.m. on Saturday.

People these days have way 
too much time on their hands. 

You don' t believe me? 
Well, you 've heard about how 
tough things are in the 90s, and 
how people are working longer 
hours for less money. You 've 
probably heard the sob stories 
from whining ninnies about 
how life is too fast-paced, and 
how we just gotta slow down 
and smell the plants. 

I disagree with all that 
rubbish. In fact, I'll prove to 
you that people have too much 
time on their hands. I'm not 
talking about baseball or 
hockey players. And I'm not 
referring to Mike Tyson or 
Leona Helmsley. 

And really, I'm not talking 
about the time I watched that 
Elvis Presley movie "Harem 
Scarem" 15 times in-a-row, or 
the way I sat transfixed 
through the whole three-hour 
Pay-Per-View concert featur-
ing David Hasselhoff live in 
Japan. 

I'm not mentioning the 
Tonya Harding fan club or a 
fr iend of mine who makes 
mock magazine covers in his 
spare time using old photos 
and lots of glue.

No, J'm tossing out all of

It seems that even in this

complain that the Kentucky 
wildcat closely resembles -

Only now, in this new era of

That's right. The University

Tritons Blow 
Away Gusties 
GALE FORCE: UCSD triumphs, 2-0, over Adolphus at home 
By Brlln K. Hutto 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD men's soccer Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong's "new season" has arrived in the 
form of the 1994 NCAA Division III National 
Championships, but as Colorado College (12-
6-2) and Gustavus Adolphus College (15-4) 
can attest, the Tritons (13-6-1) are still up to 
their same old winning tricks. 

The Tritons ousted both squads last week-
end, thrashing Colorado, 3-0, in Saturday 'S 
North CentraVFar West ~egional first round, 
before returning on Sunday to finish the Re-
gional job on Gustavus Adolphus College, 
2-0. 

UC San Diego now advances to the 
quarterfinals, where it will be pitted against 

Bethany College in West Virginia. Bethany 
(15-5-1) moved on with a 1-0 overtime win 
against Virginia Wesleyan on Sunday. 

"Once we've made the playoffs, we have a 
whole new season on our hands 'that lists only 
five games. If we play to our capabilities, we 
can definitely have a go at it," Armstrong said. 

"When -we are on, nobody can stop us." 
junior defender Matt Chilton added. "If we 
play like we did this weekend, I like our 
chances." 

With results like the Tritons' 4-1 upset vic-
tory ()ver Division I-power UC Irvine in its 
regular-season finale (Oct. 26) and this last 
weekend 's two-game playoff romping, even 
the most skeptical of bookies would lay down

GIVE 
'EM WHAT 
THEY WANT 

Electoral politics have always been an ugly businesS. 
Behind the grand promises, cheering crowds and patri-
otic milieu of elections past, candidates have invari-
ably engaged in bloody and merciless battles for the 
coveted election prize. The smiles and baby kissing 
were always superficial. . 

Though we may romanticize our political past 
- the days when politicians were supposedly 
statesmen and politics purportedly an art - it 
js undeniable that, somewhere along the line, 
electoral politics have radically changed. 

\bters have never been more cynical and 
disaffected. And politicians, who are generally 
considered to be cynicsl by nature, have never 
been more desperate, willing to do and say anything -
as Michael Huffington's ads proclaim - to win their 
respective offices. 

., In California, these trends have produced a particu-
lady nasty election battle. Voters, distrustful of poli-
ticians and fearful of the state's imminent demise 
at the hands of criminals and illegal immigrants, 
have demanded that California '8 politicians 
embrace some of the most extreme politics 
the Golden State has seen in many years. 

And the candidates have delivered-
en masse. Pete Wilson, along with virtu-
ally every GOP candIdate, has exploited 
the anti-illegal immIgration sentiment to 
placate California's mad-as-heLi elector-
ate. And nearly everY candidate in the 
state has jumped on the "get-tough-on-
crime" bandwagon, each trying to prove 
that he is "tougher" than the other - re-
gardless of how destructive or irrational 
his "solutions" may be. 

Although candidates have essential!y 
shaped themselves to fit-the electorate's 
demographic profile, California voters are 
still unsatisfied. Perhaps they sense that 
many of today's politicians lack authentic-
ity. Or perhaps they do not believe that the 
candidates represent their interests -
squandering their money on private parties 
and special interests. But maybe they sim-
ply expect too much from their elected of-
fICials - demanding nothing less than 
social, political and economic miracles:

THE BEST OF THE WORST 
Govemor: Take 
Wilson out of office 

The major parties have forced Califor-
nians to make a particularly difficull deci-
sion in the gubernatorial race this year. 
With incumbent Pete Wilson and Demo-

cratic challenger 
Kathleen 
Brown both 
vying for the 
state's highest 
office, the deci-
sion amounts to 
choosing the beller 
of two bad candi-
dates. 

Though Wilson 
has steered the 

state through some of its worst economic 
times. he has accomplished very little of 
merit during his career as governor. His 
claims of a "California Comeback" nol-
withstanding, the state is still haunted by 
economic and budgetary problems, and his 
bragging rights don 't extend much further 
than few smart pro-business decisions and 
approval of much-needed worker 's com-
pensation reform. On the other hand, 
while lamenting about how Califor-
nians must "share the burden" of 
budget cuts, Wilson cheerfully 
signed AB 971 , the fiscally destruc-
live "three-strikes" crime bill. 

Aside from proposing tax credits for 
new California businesses, Wilson has vir-
tually no economic plan. On the other 
hand, Brown has proposed a broader ta)( 
incenlive program and unveiled a $1 bil-
lion bond-financed "Rebuild California." 
Though widely criticized by Republicans, 
the proposal could play an important role 
in jump-starting the stat.e's economy and 
shifting its funding priorities. 

Wilson's re-election campaign, which 
is based almost solely on his incendiary 
anti-illegal immigrant polities and simple-

Senate: Feinstein 
is our best choice 

The editors of the Guardian endorse 
Dianne Feinstein for the position of U.S. 
Senator. Although the thought of voting 

for a "Repocrat" 
for public office 
may be somewhat 
of a disappoint-
ment, Feinstein is 
clearly the lesser 
evil. Californians 
must cast their vote 
for Feinstein to 
prevent her most 
threatening oppo-
nent, Michael 

Huffington from gaining office. 
Huffington, a first-term congressman from 
Santa Barbara, is truly nothing more than. 
a power-hungry businessman. 

While Huffington claims he is not a 
"career politician," e has become an ex-
pert at using the devious political tacties 
from which he would like to disassociate 
himself. Instead of projecting his past suc-
cesses and future goals, he stresses 
Feinstein's weak points in mud-slinging 
advertisements . The fact that Huffington 
lacks any significant accomplishments in 
Congress explains his reluctance to pro-
pound on his own record. 

Huffington is a proven hypocrite. 
Though he strongly supports Proposition 
187, he was forced last week to admit that 
he hired an illegal immigrant for whom 
he did not file taxes. When questioned 

minded "tough-
on-crime" rhetoric, si-
mullaneousiy reflects both his 
lack of political substance and "gritty 
political cynicism. Though Wilson has 
grabbed Proposition 187 as his cause 
cilebre, he has long been an advocate of a 
free-flowing U.S.-Mexican border. How-
ever, as the state economy soured and the 
coveted election prize once again appeared 
on the horizon, Wilson flip-flopped, trans-
forming himself into California's saviour 
from migrant "tax takers." 

See BROWN. page 4 

about this discrepancy, Huffington tried to 
justify his actions by asking, "Who among 
us has not broken the law?" He feels he 
can legitimize his own actions by saying 
that "everyone has done it," yet he shows 
no hesitation in cracking down on anyone 
else who is guilty of breaking the law. Who 
among us wants a politician who has no 
conscience? 

Huffington's stance on issues is as dis-
turbing as his recent statements. 
Huffington has made Proposition 187 the 
backbone of his campaign. He not only 
supports the major provisions of this ini-
tiative, which include denial of education 
and "non-emergency" health care, but goes 
so far as to support denying citizenship to 
U.S.-born children whose parents are ille-
gal immigrants. 

Huffington's record on social and en-
vironmental issues is equally reprehen-
sible. He opposes federal funding for abor-
tion except in extreme cases. He supports 
prayer in school. He opposed the Califor-
nia Desert Protection Act and co-spon-
sored a clause which allowed home own-
ers to challenge the Endangered Species 
Act rulings. 

Feinstein's record shows that she has 
steeted several important measures 
through Congress and has a strong con-
cern for social issues. Feinstein voted for 
the abortion-clinic access law and has 
pledged to nominate only abortion-riJbts 
supporters to-the federal bench. In addi-
tion, she co-authored a policy which man-
dates suspension for any student who is 
caught with a gun on school grounds.

Representatives: 
Schenk fights for 
our rights 

In the race for the 49th District of the 
House of Representatives, Democratic in-
cumbent Lynn Schenk is running against 

three-term 
County Supervi-
sor Brian Bilbray, 
who is a former 
mayor and city 
councilman of 
Imperial Beach, 
and Chris 
Hoogenboom, the 
Libertarian 
Party's offering. 

The Guardilln 
endorses Schenk, wbose previous accom-
plishments include co-sponsoring federal 
legislation which fought to ban certain as-
sault weapons as well as legislation whicb 
prohibits offshore drilling on California 
coast. 

Schenk also opposes Proposition 187, 
which would deny social services, primary 
education and "non-emergency" medical 
care to illegal immigrants, opting instead 
to strengthen border enforcement. Oppo-
nents Bilbray and Hoogenboom both sup-
port this so-called "Save Our Slate" ini-
tiative, in addition to increasing border 
control. 

Scbenk opposes scbool prayer on the 
grounds that it violates the Fint Amend-
ment. However, Bilbray, like many Re-
publicans, makes the ridiculous claim 
that organized prayer in IIChool can lOIIIe-
how accommodate everyooc's spiritual 
needs or the lack thereof, in the case of 
atheists. 

Buod on her remarkable record as a 
flIbter in Congress and her views on im-
portant social illues, tbe Guardian 
endorces Schenk for Congress. 

The UCSD Guardiaa 

In the race for the 78th Assembly, in-
cumbent Dede Alpert is running against 
Peace and Freedom party candidate James 

~ Fife, and Republi-can candidate Bruce Henderson. 
Alpert and Fife 

are running on 
similar campaign 
platforms. Alpert 
believes proposi-
tion 187 would 
"cost our of 
schools millions of 
dollars" while Fife 

has stated that "all studies show that im-
migrants contribute more to our economy 
than they take out in services." Henderson, 
however, strongly supports this initiative. 

Alpert and Fife both oppose using 
public tax dollars for private school 
vouchers, and each of these candidates 
has expressed the need to boost the fund-
ing for public education. Henderson sup-
ports state-funded school vouchers. 

On the issue of abortion, Alpert has 
stated that the choice should be accessible 
to everyone, regardless of economic sta-
tus. 

Fife also supports federal funding for 
abortion. 

Although Henderson claims to M pro-
choice, he docs not support uaing federal 
funds for reproductive-bealth services. 

Alpert has managed to stick to her 
liberal views in a county which is largely 
conservative. She also displayed an un-
canny integrity when she admiUed tbat 
th ... "three-strikes and you're out" biII, 
which she voted for, would not solve the 
crime problems and Ihould be amended 
to onl), include violent offenden. Al-
though Alpert and Fife have similar 
stances on key issuC8, the GIIIU'tIitm en-
dones Alpert, bej;luse of ber strong-
willed display of leadenhip as an Assem-
blywoman. 

TAKING THE INITIATIVE 
Proposition 187: Measure is mean-spirited and dangerous 

Propolition 187, 
tbe so-callect... "Save 
Our Slate" initiative, 
seeks to deny public 
social.lervicel, in-
cluding "non-emer-
gency" medical care 
and K-12 education, 
to illegal immigrants 

in California. The 
proposition, which 
was widely sup-
ported early in the 
campaign, has 
come under fire from all political corners: 

Californians have become increasingly 
aware of its dangerous implications 

and dubious legal standing. 
One of the primary facets of the 

bill - denying primary educa-
tion to "illegal" children - is 
unequivocally unconstitu-

tional, violating the 1982 Su-
preme Court ruling Plyer v. Doe, 

which reaffirmed "illegal" 
children's right to public primary edu-

cation. Proponents of the measure, in-
cluding our illustrious governor, Pete 

Wilson, assert that Proposition 187 would 
ultimately challenge and overturn Plyer . 

Though moat legal schoIus 
disagree, the anti-eclucation 
provision is instructive of 
the overall tenor of the bill: 
cruel, irrational and costly. 

Such a policy would 
amount to giving an esti-
mated 300,000 "illegal" 
children a one-way ticket to 
America's underclass. De-
nied basic education and 
subsequently opportunity, 
many of these children 
would only add to the 

state's woes by turning to crime and gangs, 
and ultimately, by filling its jails and morgues. 

To enforce this provision, the proposition 
would tum the state's educators into de facto 
Immigration and Nationalization Service of-
ficials, forcing them to report "suspected," un-
documented children and their parents to lo-
cal, state and federal authorities. Such police-
state tactics are also illegal, however, violat-
ing the Federal Family Right and Privacy Bill, 
which could cost California schools billions 
in federal funding. t;\Il told, the Legislative 
Analyst estimates a loss of $15 billion dol-
lars in federal funding, if the proposition is 
passed and enforced. 

Though tbe educational provision has been 

subject to the mOlt criticism, Proposition 
187's .ncmpt to bar illegal immigrants from 
"non-emcrgency" medical care is just as iII-
conceived and dangerous. Denying "illegal" 
children immunization sbots and more gen-
erally, making a trip to the hospital for illegal 
immigrants synonymous with being'deported 
or imprisoned, would be, as many health-care 
providers have pointed out, a public health 
disaster. 

In addition, the proposition would mandate 
five-year prison sentences for possession of . 
false documentation. Under this provision, 
Californians would be forced to spend millions 
to imprison "illegal" mothers who attempt to 
enroll their children in school and "illegal" 
workers who attempt to find employment. 

Proposition 187 is a simple-minded and 
misguided attempt to "solve" the problem of 
illegal immigration. Rhetoric aside, illegal 
immigrants are already barred from the vast 
majority of SQCial services, including welfare 
and food stamps. Illegal immigrants, however, 
do not come to California for social services, 
they come for jobs. 

If passed, the proposition would do noth-
ing to stop the flow of illegal immigration, 
making a sizable number of California resi-
dents needlessly suffer. The Guardian 
strongly urges a "no" vote on Proposition 187. 

Proposition 188: A cure for California s health-care ills 
In 1993, Califor-

nians spent over $40 
billion on health care. 
Never has California 
spent so much and re-
ceived so little: An es-
timated six million 
Californians, 60 per-
cent of whom are 
working middle-class 
families, are without 
coverage; many others 
are denied the neces-
sary cOverage because 
of pre-existing medical 
conditions; and most 
Californians' health insurance is limited, de-
nying basics such as medication, mental-
health (:Jre and long-term care. 

Though national health-care reform re-
mains an elusive goal, Proposition 186, tbe 

I Health Security Act, provides Californians 
I with an alternative. If passed, Proposition 186, 

the Health Security Act, would dismantle 
California's for-profit insurance industry and 
establish a comprehensive, single-payer 
health-care system in California. 

Headed by an elected Health Commis-

sioner, the state agency 
would, serving as the single 
insurer, pay hospital and doc-
tor bills, as well as negogiate 
health-care fees, global bud-
gets and drug prices. Under 
the plan, Californians would 
be able to choose their 
health-care providers - be it 
private practi tioners or 
Health Maintenance Organi-
zations (HMO) - fostering 
competition-and improving 
overall quality of service. 

Despite fears that Proposi-
tion 186 would create another 

daunting, inefficient, state bureaucracy, the 
truth is that the single-payer system is inher-
enll y more efficient than the current unregu-
lated insurance system. According to several 
independent studies, Proposition 186 would 
save Californians between $13 and $20 billion 
annually - enough to provide every Califor-
nian with comprehensive health-care coverage. 

Under Proposition 186, the money which 
is currently funneled into the insurance in-
dustry would be collected through business 
and income taxes. Businesses would pay be-

tween 4.4 and 8.9 percent payroll tax (depend-
ing on their size); and individuals would pay 
2.5 percent income tax (five percent if they 
earn over $500,000 per year). 

While opponents claim that Proposition 
186 would hurt California businesses, health-
care expenses would actually drop under the 
measure. Currently, businesses spend between 
to and 17 percent on employee health care, 
while Proposition 186 they would spend a 
maximum of 8.9 percent. 

Though Proposition 186 has been subject 
to much misinformation (the insurance in-
dustry has spend over $5.5 million in its ef-
fort to derail the initiative), it is a logical, 
well-tbought out plan which would both pro-
vide Californians with comprehensive 

heaIth~are and contain skyrocketing health 
care costs. 

As such, it is not surprising that several 
large mainstream organizations have endorsed 
the proposition, including the American As-
sociation of Retired People, League of 
Women Voters and Consumer's Union, the 
publishers of Consumer Reports. In addition, 
John F. Alksne, dean of UCSD School of 
Medicine, recently endorsed Proposition 186. 
The Guardian urges a "yes" vote. 

Proposition 184: 'Three strikes' will cost the state billions 
Proposition 184, the 

"t h ree~stri kes-and-
you're-out" anti-crime 
measure, follows on tbe 
heals of a number of re-
cently passed "three-
strikes" crime bills, in-
cluding California's AS 
971. Though virtually 
identical to the current 
law, Proposition 184 
would have tbe unfortu-
nate effect of embedding 
the flawed "three 
strikes" legislation into 
California's legislative foundation. Proposi-
tion 184 would require a nearly impossible 
two-thirds legillative vote - as opposed 10 
the present majority vote - to repeal 

Californians have every reaoa 10 .. void 
this lituation. While violent crimi_ must 
be kept off the atreeb, the current law and 

Proposition 184 seek to 
"strike out" every repeat, 
nonviolent offender in the 
state. Only ooc third of the 
"third-strikers" are violent. 
This is not only morally 
bankrupt, but will ulti-
mately COI~ California's 
taxpayers billions of dollars 
per year . . 

The California Depart-
ment of Corrections esti-
mates that under "three 
strikes" the state's prison 
population will double from 

126,000 to 232,000 by the year 2000, push-
ing prilon coats from S3 billion to close to S6 
billion annually. Prison officials project that 
California will be required to build an addi-
tional 25 prisons to handle the inmate explo-
lion. 

Ten years aao, California spent three per-

cent of its annual budge, on prisons; today, it 
spends seven percent. In the next JO years, 
Californians can expect an even larger slice 
of the pie will be used to "strike out" crimi-
nals, severely limiting the state's ability to 
maintain and expand its services and infra-
structure, including primary and higher edu-
cation. 

Though the current law and Proposition 
184 do have the immediate effect of keeping 
violent felons off the street, little evidence 
suPPOrts proponents' claims tbat it will act as 
a deterrent; "three strikes" laws are more con-
cerned with serving criminals with their "just 
desserts. " 

However, by not distinguishing between 
"tbird-strikers" convicted of selling marijuana 
and those convicted of murder and rape, the 
current law and Proposition 184 make a 
mockery of justice while forcing Californians 
to foot the bill. The G""rdUut ufles a "no" 
vote on Proposition 184.

MEASURING Up 
Proposition 181: Passenger rail bonds are too costly 

Proposition 181, the Passenger 
Rail and Clean Air Bond Act of 
1994, would allow California to sell 
$1 billion in general-obligations 
bonds to fund intercity-, commuter-
and transit-rail programs. ' 

At first glance, this may seem 
like a step in the right direction to 
increase California's use of alterna-
tive transportation. ,However, it 
would be an under-used system of 
transportation. In addition, a closer 
look at the financing of this propo-
sition reveals that it would be a step 
backward for California 's 
economy. 

It would take 
up to 20 yeara for 
California to pay 
off the expenses 
incurred by this 
bill. Because sell-
ilig bonds is sim- ' 
ply a way for the 
state to borrow 
money, interest 
payments would 
be relatively 
high. This act 
would ensure a long-term borrow-
ing policy; thus, California's Gen-
eral Fund would be forced to pay 

off a 
amount 
money. 

buge 
of 

The General 
Fund had a 
$19.4 billion 
debt as of July 
1, 1994, of 
which $14.4 
billion was 
from general-
obligation 
bonds sucb as 

the one proposed for this initiative. 
The Legislative Analyst estimates 
that if Proposition 181 is passed, 

California's General Fund debt 
would total $22.4 billion by 1997. 
Assuming that the interest rate 
would be six percent, the state 
would have to pay an average of 
$81.5 million in interests per year. 

The General Fund should not be 
used as a bottomless grab-baa to pay 
for every environmentaUy-oriented 
project whicb the Senate Transpor-
tation Committee or the Business, 
Transportation and Housing Agency 
dreams up. It would be detrimental 
to tbe state's already ailing 
economy. Tbe GlUlrdian urges a 
"no" vote on Proposition 181. 

Proposition 183: Measure would infringe on voters' rights 
One of our constitutional rights, 

as voters, is to recall state elections 
in a timely fashion. Under current 
law, the Secretary of State certifies 
the validity of petitions to recall. 
The governor must then call a spe-
cial election to be held between 60 
and 80 days after the date of certifi-
cation. 

Proposition 183 would amend 
the constitution to permit the gov-
ernor to recall elections within 180 
days of certification, rather than 60 
to 80, so .that they could be incor-
porated into regularly scheduled 

elections. 
Although pro-

ponents of 
Proposition 183 
claim tbat it 
would save Cali-
forn ia taxpayers 
millions of dol-
lars for separate 
recall elections, 
the measure 
would simulta-
neously remit 
their right to take irresponsible poli-
tician:; out of office. 

In the last 81 
years, qnly four 
recall elections 
have been re-
called in Cali-
fornia, three of 

. which were held 
between 1913 
and 1914. What-
ever the cost of 
special elec-
tions, they do 
not occur often 

enough to place significant costs • 
on the state. 

However, if the right to immedi-
ate recall is taken away by this ini-
tiative, the results could be devas-
tating. 

Proposition 183 would allow 
state officials, no matter how cor-
rupt they may be, to remain in of-
fice until the next scheduled elec-
tion, whicb could be as long as six 
months. 

The initiative would grant them 
time to do as they wish, while they 
still retain their government office. 
We can't afford to give politicians 
this luxury. 

Proposition 185: Vote for clean air, jobs and transit efficiency 
Proposition 185, also known as 

the Clean Air, Jobs and Transporta-
tion Efficiency Act, would call for 
a four-percent tax on gasoline to 
fund public transportation improve-
ments throughout the state. Oppo-
nents of this bill want to convince 
voters that this initiative would raise 
taxes by an exorbitant amount; how-
ever, this bill would actually save 
money by creating a special trans-
portation fund which could not be 
raided by legislators. 

Proposi tion 185 would save our ai r 
and energy by converting existing 
transportation systems to electrical 

and clean fuel sys-
tems, as well as 
mandating that fu-
ture systems fol-
low the same 
clean fuel sys-
tems. The fi rst 27 
percen t of rev-
enues wh ich this 
initiative proposes 
to generate would, 
in part, fund elec-
tric- and clean-ve-
hicle research and development. In 
addition, Proposition 185 would pro-
vide funding for the protection of eco-

logically sensi-
tive lands, tree 
planting and bi-
cycle and trail 

" projects. 
Transporta-

tion efficiency 
would also be 
greatly improved. 
Seventy-three 
percent of rev-
enues would go 
toward projects 

such as the improvement of the Los 
Angeles-San Diego rail corridor, and 
the restoration of rail service between 

San Diego and Imperial counties~ 
Furthermore, these projects would 
create new jobs for Californians. 

Proposition 185 would also en-
force Californians' safety in several 
ways. It would reduce accidents by 
providing funds for the enforcement 
of efficient grade-crossing laws. In 
addition, it would make roads and 
bridges earthquake-safe and up-
grade public transportation for the 
elderly and disabled. 

A four-percent gas tax is a small 
sacrifice, considering that it could 
improve our air, (!)ur economy, our 
transportation and our safety. 

Proposition 188: Don't be a sucker to cigarette companies 
Proposition 188 is a carefully 

worded but thinly veiled piece of 
legislation which would harm the 
quality of health for Californians. 
With its biggest backers being the 
corporate smoking monoliths Philip 
Morris and RJ Reynolds, common 
sense clearly dictates that the propo-
sition could not possibly serve the 

health interests of Californians. 
Meanwhile, the American Cancer 
Society, American Lung Associa-
tion and American Heart Associa-
tion vehemently oppose the pro-
posal. 

While the proposition purports 
that it would ban and regulate smok-
ing advertisements and market ven-

ues, and increase penalities for seil-
ing tobacco products to minors, its 
premise lies in centralizing all 
smoking legislation in the state. The 
result would repeal tough local 
sanctions against smoking and re-
place them with considerably less 
stringent laws. 

Not only are Californians 

harmed by the detrimental effects of 
first- and second-hand smoke, but 
taxpayers could potentially be 
forced to subsidize health-care costs 
for individuals afflicted with smoke-
related diseases. 

Clearly, Proposition 188 would 
only devastate California's already 
declining quality of life. 

. Proposition 189: Vote to keep rapists off our streets 
When someone i!' arrested on a 

criminal charge, the alifornja State 
Constitution requires the courts to 
release him on bail while awaiting 
trial. Exceptions to this are cases in 
which the alleged criminal is ac-
cused of "Capital crimes ... felony 
offenses involving acts of violence 
on another person ... or felony of-

BROWN: 
ContInued ........ 2 

Brown, of course, bas used 
her opposition to Propoaition 
187 to distinguisb herself from 
Wilson, saying that the measure 
would only compound 
California's aociaI and economic 
problems. In line with otber 
Democrats, Brown bas instead 
advocated tigbter border en-
forcement and, disturbingly, use 
of "tamper proof" California ID 
cards. 

Billing berself as a fighter for 
education, Brown has promised 
to freeze higher education fees 
at their current levels. In addi-
tion, Brown says she would cut 
primary school administration 
by 13 percent to establisb drug-
education and after-school pro-
grams; and sbe proposes estab-
lishing "Joi>Ready," a college-
preparation and job-training pro-
gram. Wilson, a long-standing 
supporter of "school vouchers" 
and "charter scbools," has no 
education plan outside of push-
ing for privatization. 

Though Brown's opposition 
to Proposition 187 and mild edu-
cation-reform proposals are liig-
nificant, she has more in com-
mon with Wilson than the rheto-
ric suggests. Like most politi-
cians in the state, Brown has 
taken up such hot-button issues 
as welfare reform and crime. 

Both candidates support two-
year limits on welfare; and 
Brown additionally proposes 
cutting welfare grants five per-
cent and freezing cost-of-living 

, adjustments. 
On crime, BrowJ:l and Wilson 

are nearly indistingui!rhable. 
Regardless of her "personal" 
opposition to capital punish-
ment, Brown says would not in-
terfere with her signing capital 
offender's last rites. Ironically, 
the so-called fighter for educa-
tion also unconditionally sup-
ports California's fatally flawed 
"three strikes" crime bills: AB 
971 and its twin sister, Proposi-
tion 184 - both of which "strike 
out" non-violent third-timers. 

Third-party candidates are 
worth considering. However, tbe 
Libertarian, American Indepen-
dent and Peace &. Freedom party 
candidates each advocat~ politics 
which are even more destructive 
than those of tbe status quo. 
Gloria La Riva of the Peace and 
Freedom Party, for example, is 
running on an platform of taxing 
"big business" and doubling 
minimum wage to $8.50 - a 
very good recipe for economic 
disaster. On the other band, lib-
ertarian candidate Ricbard Rider 
would, if he bad bis way, abolisb 
all state service, save perbaps tbe 
National puard and CalTrans. 

Even if one can stomach 
these candidates' politics, prac-
tical issues remain: Either Wil-
son or Brown will occupy the 
Governor's Mansion in a couple 
of days, and California will have 
to live under one of their regimes 
for four years. Considering the 
gravity ofthe issues in this year's 
election, a protest vote is a 
luxury which many Californians 
cannot afford. 

Though Brown is far from the 
ideal candidate, her opposition to 
Proposition 187, apparent com-
mitment to educ:ation and con-
crete economic plan give ber the 
one-up over Walloa. The GIM"yJ-
iM endo .... KIdIIeea Brown for 
governor.
