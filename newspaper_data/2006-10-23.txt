A recent lawsuit between the 
Web site www.pickaprofcom and 
the University of California chal-
lenged the 6-year-old Web site on 
issues of student privacy and inap-
propriate usage. 

Pick-A-Prof currently serves, 
without conflict or dispute, over 
200 universities nationwide, provid-
ing students with access to class-by-
class grade distribution and student 
opinions on various professors -
for a fee. According to Karen Bragg, 
the director for university relations 
at Pick-A-Prof, it is the former that 
makes the Web site worth its price 
against free competitors.

The first of four Bear Gardens 
- an offshoot of once-weekly "Thank

its doors Oct. 20 to a crowd of 550, 
although a campus policy prohibiting 
the advertisement of the presence of 
alcohol at university events hindered 
desired attendance levels, according to 
multiple A.S. councilmembers. 

Rather than a concert, the Bear 
Garden was a penned-in area full of 
carnival-style booths where students

free food and drinks - or free beer for 
the over-21 crowd.

UC Faculty Join 

Institute of Medicine 
Eleven UC faculty members 

have been recently chosen among 
65 new members inducted into 
the ational Academies' Institute of 
Medicine. 

The UC system showed the high-
est representation this year with 11 
new members, compared to othe r 
universities that had a maximum 
of four in the election. There are 
currently a total of 1,051 members, 
161 of them from the University of 
California. 

This honor is considered one of 
the highest bestowed upon medical 
and health professionals. Appointed 
by current members, ca ndidates 
undergo an intensive selection pro-
cess and are nominated on the basis 
of professional achievements and 
commitment to service. 

This year's members include 
researchers, department chairs, pro-
fessors and university officials, and 
their backgrounds range from law . 
to medicine to psychiatry. The new-
est members are from UC Berkeley, 
UCLA, UCSD and UC San Francisco, 
four of whom are from UCSD. 

Young Adult Health 
Needs Attention 
The healthiness of young adults 

lags far behind adolescents, with 
mortality rates more than ' double 
that of teens due to increased rates 
of injury, illness, homicide and sui-
cide, according to a new UC San 
Francisco analysis by adolescent-

medici ne researchers . 
Young adults mirror adolescents 

in terms of hea lth issues, but they 
have received little attention from 
today's researchers, policymak-
ers and professionals, according 
to M. Jane Park, a uthor of "The 
Health Status of Young Adults in the 
United States." As a result, research-
ers emphasize the need for more 
focused research and programs tar-
geted towa rd adul ts, comparable to 
earlier efforts directed at teens. 

Among 18- to 24-year-old adults, 
suicide rates are three times higher 
than adolescents, with young men 
being six times more likely than 
young women to commit suicide. 
Unintentional injury is the lead-
ing cause of death, however, with 
about 70 percent attributed to 
motor vehicle accidents and a large 
number of them involvi ng alcohol 
use. The incidence of homicide 
also peaks in young adulthood, 
with males being more likely to 
commit a homicide. 

Young adults also make up the 
group with the lowest rate of health 
insurance coverage, with only 38 
percent of young men and 31 per-
cent of young women insured. 

Another fador that sheds light 
on the statistics is drug use, with 
the rate of tobacco use by young 
adults - the leading cause of death 
among all ages - over three times 
that of adolescents. The rate of heavy 
drinking among young adults is five 
times higher than that of teens, 
and rates of illicit drug use nearly 
double that of adolescents. 

"Many young people are left to 
fend for themselves, as their risk 
for health problems gets worse," 
Park said.

UCSD Posts Grade Distributions for Free 
• PROfESSOR, from page 1 

"No one else gives the grades;' 
Bragg said. "By doing that, we just 
take the whole concept of rating 
your professors a little more seri -
ously than the others:' 

However, it is this same feature 
that spurred UC Davis's original 
complaint about student privacy. 

"[The UC schools] didn't con -
sider grade breakdown public 
information; Bragg said. "But we 
felt that students had the right to 
know so that they could pick the 
professor that best suited them and 
their particular learning environ-
ment." 

Chris Patti, the attorney who 
represented the University of 
California in the lawsuit , said that 
Pick-A-Prof claimed that the grade 

. breakdown was covered under the 
California Public Records Act, a 
"statute ... that allows members of 
the public to attain records from 
public agencies." 

In addition to privacy concerns, 
Patti said, the UC system was wor-
ried "that the data [on the Web 
site] would be used in a way where 
students would essentially be tak-
ing courses based on [past] grades, 
which would create additional 
problems between professors who 
might try to raise their grade aver-
ages just to get more kids to sign up 
for their classes." 

In a suit spanning a few months, 
the UC system, particul.arly Davis, 
agreed on a settlement. 

"We ended up negotiating addi-
tional protections for privacy; Patti 
said. "We excluded courses with 
10 or less students; we excluded 

courses in which all the students 
got the same grade. We didn't real -
ly have any evidence in hand of the 
negative consequences of posting 
the grade distribution, so we I ulti -
mately] decided to turn over [the 
grades I to [Pick-A-ProfJ ." 

Ultimately, the terms of the 
agreement were acceptable to both 
parties. 

"It was to the satisfaction of 
the university that student privacy 
was going to be respected; said 
Ricardo Vazquez, a UC Office of 
the President spokesman . "We set-
tled, and the grades were turned 
over to the [Web site] beginning 

I 
It was to the 

satisfaction of the 
university that student 
privacy was going to 

be respected" 
- Ricardo Vazquez, 

Spokesman, UC Office 
of the President 

with UC Davis." 
Though this seemed like a win 

for Pick-A-Prof, many UC schools, 
including UCSD, have taken mea-
sures to make it harder for the Web 
site to gain a significant follOWing in 
California, and without that, Bragg 
said, "We just won't bother offering 
the service to the schools." 

Associate Vice Chancellor for 

Und~rgraduate Education Mark 
Appelbaum said that his office 
"decided that it hardly seemed fair 
to make UCSD students pay for 
something that , according to the 
state's ruling, was their property 
anyway." 

In accordance with that belief, 
Appelbaum said that UCSD has 
posted all the grade distributions 
that are currently "for sale" on Pick-
A-Prof for free at the registrar's Web 
site. 

"I doubt [Pick-A-Prof is] goi ng 
to make much money off of UCSD 
students, because now they can get 
that info for free;' sai5!-Appelbaum, 
who added that he had never 
thought about posting the infor· 
mation before that time because 
it had never occurred 10 him that 
students might be interested in 
obtaining it. 

"It doesn't seem to be the way 
UCSD students operate," he said. 
"Students here take courses because 
they're interested in the subject, o r 
because they're required to. Most 
students here don't really use the 
grade distributions in the way of 
picking courses:' 

Also, according to Appelbaum, 
word seems to get around about 
"wicked" professors, whether or 
not the university posts grade dis-
tributions. 

"All our students really want to 
know is if they'll stay interested in 
the class," he said. "They're all smart 
enough that if they stay interested, 
the grades will just come:'

Weighing 
the Costs 
of Higher 
Education 
F ifty thousand dollars. That's the bill I'm looking at six months after graduation, 
when the deferment period for my 
student loans ends. And frankly, it's a 
terrifying prospect. This is debt that 
has accumulated despite scholarships, 
despite working multiple jobs, despite 
having a tight budget. At the same time 
as degrees become more important in 
the job market, they also are becoming 
far less affordable. 

In fact, college costs have increased 
rapidly across the country over in the 
last decade, with students paying 42 
percent more for tuition in 2005 than 
they paid in 2000, a rate that far out-

~ a Turnip

paces the rate of inflation. But as col-
lege costs have increased, financial aid 
has decreased_ In 1975, the average Pell 
Grant covered nearly 84 percent of the 
cost of college; today, the average only 
covers 36 percent. This means that 
for many students, loans are quickly 
becoming necessary to pay for col-
lege. According to separate analyses by 
the American Council on Education 
and the CoUege Board, close to two-
thirds ofloans students take out are for 
bachelor's degrees, averaging a debt of 
more than S 15,000 each. At UCSD, the 
rate is slightly lower, with 54 percent 
of UCSD undergraduates taking out 
federal or private loans. 

Unfortunately, even these are 
becoming more costly, as the Deficit 
Reduction Act of 2005 recently 
increased the rates for the federal 
Stafford loan. 

But is a bachelor's degree even 
enough? According to a Capitol Hill 
testimony by James Merisotis, president 
of the Institute for Higher Education 
Policy, 87 percent of Americans think 
that a high school graduate should 
continue onto college instead of start-
ing a job. With so many people bent 
on getting a bachelor's degree, such a 
degree no longer becomes remarkable 
on resumes - it becomes required. 

And, according to White House 
economists, wage stagnation is hitting 
people with bachelor's degrees for the 
first time in 30 years, despite the fact 
that the nation is growing economi-
cally. Starting pay is especially low for 
humanities degrees like mine, with 
salaries for English majors declining by 
4.1 percent last year. 

It's not as if this is a temporary set-
back either; wage erosion is expected 
to continue as the ' number of coUege 
graduates rises in China, India and 
other offshore hubs. It's obvious that 
a bachelor's degree isn't enough to 
ensure a good job anymore. 

But at the same time, I'm forced to 
ask myself this question: Can I afford 
to go even further into this hole In 
order to get a graduate. degree? 

In many ways I'm lucky; at least I 
have a parent who is able to CO-sign on 
my loans. But for many low-income 
families, even these loans are outside 
of their reach. 

Several recent reports have criti-
cized the fact that, despite the percep-
!ion of progress, gaps between col-
lege-attending low- and high-income 
students are actuaUy wider than they

Language Requirement 
a Must for Integration 

English-Only Provision 
Encourages Isolation 

By Matt L'Heureux 
SENtOR STAFF WRITER 

A s any self-aware American can tell you, life can be bro-ken down into three basic 
cycles - birth. death and filling 
out extensive government paper-
work for just about everything in 
between. Similarly, he or she could 
direct you almost immediately to 
the back or bottom of said forms. 
on which every direction is print-
ed in some combination of other 
languages - or at the very least, 
in Spanish. Even an agency like 
the Department of Motor Vehicles, 

America without speaking her lan-
guage. 

Though English is admittedly 
difficult to learn - one may argue 
that there are certain economic bar-
riers to adequate education in the 
United States - many resources are 
available for those who actively seek 
to participate in facets of American 
life. Whether it's a regular second-
ary and university education, adult 
education programs. or vocational 
English classes to train people for 
certain careers, the ways one can 
leam English outnumber the excus-
es why he or she cannot. 

When it comes down to it, there 
known for making every-
thing as inconvenient as 
possible, has a sister Web 
site "en Espaflol." One

excuse for adult citizens 
not knowing the lan-
guage that dictates busi-

then must wonder: Is this soci-
etal norm merely a courtesy, or a 
crutch for those who do not speak 
English? 

Sen. James lnhofe (R-Okla.) 
clearly agrees with the latter, hav-
ing propOsed a bill on Aug_ 3 that 
would effectively conduct aU offi-
cial U.S. business in English, thus 
removing bilingual messages from 
government documents. According 
to Inhofe's Web site, the purpose 
of the bill is not to discriminate 
against non-English speakers, but 
to encourage integration among the 
people of our nation. 

While at first glance it may seem 
rash to eliminate this ~ing stone 
altogether, profiCiency in English 
is already required by law in order 
to be a citizen of the United States. 
In that sense, the sentiment behind 
Inhofe's bill is neither revolution-
ary nor particularly shoddng. But 
it does make an effort to address 
those people who - for one reaaon 
or another - have slipped through 
the cracks, and currently live In 

ness in their country of residence. 
Many nonspeai<ers with English-
speaking children or spouses rely 
on their loved ones as interpreters 
for official business, providing yet 
another step of distance in a cul-
turally polarized society with little 
integration between its economic 
classes. Multiply that by the more 
than 36 million people living in 
California alone, and it poses some 
questions without easy answers. 

As such, the real issue becomes 
clear: How much cuhural isolation-
ism can America tab! before some-
thing is done about it? 

Some of Inhofe's main detractors 
have ca1Ied the quest roc linguistic

A "land of opponunity" in the eyes of many, the United States draws a huge number 
of immigrants each year - and with 
them comes a steady flow of foreign 
languages. In recent memory, the fed-
era! government has repeatedly tried 
to pass laws declaring English the 
official language, making immigrants 
struggle without the chance to receive 
translation of official documents. The 
most recent piece of legislation con-

Muir Remodel Favors Aesthetics Over Function 
Bathroom doors 
that don't lock, poor 
drainage, cracked 
showers: Welcome to 
John Muir College. 

Hadl9 Mendoza 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

There is· no question: When it 
comes to stylish decor, the newly 
remodeled Tioga residence hall 
clearly outclasses the decades-old 
interior of its sister Tenaya. But 
the residents of John Muir' College's 
Tenaya Hall need not worry - they 
live' in the building that has what 
really counts: functionality. 

The Tioga remodel, though spar-
kly and new, was poorly planned and 
executed. Many second-year resi-
dents, house advisers and Muir resi-
dent councilmembers have already 
voiced their criticism. Addressing 
the issue of complaints in an e-
mail. Mark Cunningham, director 
of Housing and Dining Services, 
stated, "The functionality of some 
of the remodeled space and some of 
the new furniture would describe a 
large portion of the concerns which 
were brought to me and the need 
for student involvement." 

Although the lack of student 
involvement in such projects has 
been a big issue, no students were 
invited to participate in the renova-
tion planning committee. 

What is especially frustrating 
about the renovation is that many 
of the new "improvements" are less 
practical than the originals. For 
example, the bathrooms used to 
have a central drain, but this is now 
gone - the smaUer stall drains can-
not properly drain the water, which 
reportedly pools on the floor. The 
post-remodel bathroom doors don't 

lock, wbich has raised questions 
about the safety of lone showering 
students. It could be reasoned that 
a showering student could simply 
lock the suite door; however, the 
new suite doors also seem to be a 
safety concern as well, since many 
doorknobs have already fallen off. 

The bathrooms seem to be par-
ticularly troublesome. For example, 
the once-large toilet paper dispens-
ers have been replaced by smaller, 
yet more stylish, ones. Although 
these new dis-
pensers are cute, 

tance of longevity. The couches in 
Tenaya residence hall are probably 
older than most of the students -
because remodels are meant to be 
long-lasting. It's not every summer 
that an entire Muir residence hall 
is essentially gutted and renewed. 
Much of Tioga's furniture is cheap 
and disposable, and bardly stands 
a chance against the regular wear 
and tear of rowdy college freshmen . 
Sure, the new desk chairs are space-
agey and cool, but the thin plastic 

will never hold 
up for the next

penser's worth

Meanwhile, the 
old copper pip-
ing was left alone 
to leak for anoth-
er 20 years. 

Another 
less pragmatic 
adjustment was 
the method of 
ordering new 
furniture . The

So why were 
these cheaper

sen? 

H&DS cer-
tainly isn't short 
on dough. With 
a record-break-
ing number of 
new freshmen 
living on cam-

based its lounge-
furniture design off of the bottom-
loor lounge; however, tbat lounge 
is significantly smaller than all of 
the others. Because the committee 
didn't take this extra space into 
account, the majority of house 
lounges are inadequately furnished . 
With a record-breaking number of 
students, lounges need more seating 
space, not less. The list goes on, as 
examples such as these are apparent 
in every aspect of the modernized 
space from bedrooms to bathrooms 
to common rooms. 

Besides the apparent ridiculous-
ness of many of the changes, H&DS 
didn't take into account the impor-

pus this year, 
H&DS is raking 

in the chips. Altbough costs for the 
re.model are still being finalized, 
according to Cunningham, there is 
so much unexpected revenue from 
incoming freshmen tbat Muir stu-
dents alone should have financed 
the remodel with money to spare. 

With a record-high number of 
incoming freshmen, 147 double 
rooms in Muir are being used as 
new ·plus one" triple rooms. Even 
ignoring the 160 or so unexpected 
Muir freshmen living in ReveUe, 
that's an extra 147 people's worth of 
housing payments. Cunningham's 
stated explanation i.s that "our goal 
is always to make all non -regular

spaces as close to 'revenue neutral' 
- we discount the 'room portion to 
aU occupants of the triple equally 
and that amount is based on all the 
estimated costs we incur in provid-
ing these unanticipated extra beds." 
But this explanation doesn't hold 
water - unlike Muir's new shower 
staUs. 

The H&DS Web site estimates 
the cost of living in an on-campus 
double to be $8,200 per student, 
per year. This comes out to $16,400 
revenue per double unit. Because 
there are now three students living 
in this same space, the H&DS fee 
is lowered by $500 for each student 
living in the "plus one" triple room. 
After subtracting this $1,500, the 
"plus one" rooms generate $23,100 
each. This is an extra $6,700 per 
triple room. With 147 of these 
rooms set up through Muir. tbe 
total is 5984,900 in extra income 
from these residents alone. 

Keep in mind that this reve-
nue was entirely unanticipated. 
The remodel was planned and set 
into action long before enrollment 
numbers were finalized. Therefore, 
there is no way that this money has 
already been spent. Since no extra 
space was added, we can assume 
there isn't a substantial increase in 
cleaning or maintenance services 
to pay for. Then it appears that the 
extra beds purcbased for students 
must be made of gold, since 147 
simple dorm beds cost H&DS near-
ly $1 million. 

Even by the most conservative 
measure, it's clear that the abun-
dance of triple rooms generated a 
hefty excess revenue. And if the 
bulk of the interior Tioga residence 
hall is flimsy and already falling 
apart, bow is this money really 
being spent? 

Cunningham was unavailable 
for comment before press time.

were 30 years ago. The Advisory 
Committee of Student Financial 
Assistance argues that 1.4 million to 
2.4 million bachelor's degrees will be 
lost this decade as "financial concerns 
prevent academically qualified stu-
dents from the lowest income bracket 
from attending college:' According to 
the U.S. Census Bureau, 75 percent of 
qualified high-income .students enter 
college today, while only 3 1 percent of 
low-income students do. This essen-
tiaUy means that students with the 
highest test scores in the lowest socio-
economic group attend coUege at the 
same rate as students with the lowest 
test scores from the highest socioeco-
1I0mic group. It's terribly ironic that 
education, often viewed as a ticket out 
of poverty, is being denied to those 
wbo most need it. 

With federal funding for educa-
tion faUing, it's not likely that these 
trends will be turned around anytime 
soon. The conversation is only barely 
entering the national agenda, witb 
efforts like U.S. Secretary of Education 
Margaret SpeUings' hopefully bein 
the first of many. Even if the situ-
ation does change, it's not likely to 
affect me or anyone else who is cur-
rently in school. lostead, recent and 
future UCSD graduates face increas-
ing 'pressure to compete for a declining 
number of high-paying jobs without 
having the luxury of a leisurely job 
search. I know I don't have the time 
to waste, not with my loan payment 
schedule banging ominously over my 
bead. Gone are the hopes of travel, or 
of having space and time to adjust to 
the real world. 

A real world that, for me, is 
approaching all too quickly.

Linguistic Nudge Needed 
to Break Isolation Habits 

• PRO, from page 4 
for internationar communications 
or schools that encourage bilingual 
education supplemental to English. 
For senior citizens in the process of 
acclimating to a new language, an 
interpreter can be prOVided under 
Inhofe's bill. The legislation is as 
accommodating as possible, without 
deviating from the core message. 
Ultimately, according to recent polls 
by Zogby International, 84 percent of 
Americans - including 77 percent of 
Latinos - agree with making English 
the national language. 

Still, failed attempts at similar leg-
islation in the past show that the 
concept behind this proposal has not 
been - and will not be - universally 
accepted. Whether it boils down to 
partisan politics, underlying social 
agendas or good old-fashioned spin 
doctoring, it's clear that some feel 
they deserve to be exceptions to the 

standards to which every citizen is 
expected to adhere. However, like 
the parent who pushes his shy child 
into a room full of new faces and 
says, "play;' the end result of common 
language interaction can only help 
these new Americans interact with 
those around them instead of isolat-
ing themselves. The gratification may 
not be instant, but later the child will 
be more well-rounded and worldly 
because of it. 

While the process of making 
every American fluent in English is 
certainly not one to be taken lightly, 
the benefits ultimately outweigh the 
temporary inconvenience. The goal 
in this process is not the exclusion 
of minorities or any groups for that 
matter - the goal is the inclusion 
of all those who live in the United 
States under the one, overarching 
cultural characteristic that defines us 
as Americans. 

English-Only Bill Alienates

an English Plus resolution was even 
introduced in Congress. 

There are alternatives to mak-
ing English an official language. In 
response to U.S. English, another 
group has risen that promotes a dif-
ferent type of learning. English Plus 
supports the idea that all U.S. citizens 
should have the right to become pro-
ficient in English plus one or more 
languages. The group encourages

Either of these two ideas are Iikdy 
to end up as a law in the coming 
years as the congressional discussion 
grows. The tint rises from the idea that 
immigrant assimilation should entail 
leaving the native language behind, 
while the second supports learning 
Eng1ish as well as preserving heritage.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK 

OnfJoming 
TRAFFIC 

UCSD's Parking and 
Transportation office has made 
some long-anticipated changes, 
and has already seen results. 

By Megan Durham 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

U (SD students, like those of any university in a city, have com· plained so much about parking for so long that there never 
seemed to be anything new to say. 
Anyone who has outlived their two years 
of guaranteed housing knows all the old 
complaints. In fact, numerous Facebook 
groups are dedicated to griping about 
such things as how much it sucks to 
find a spot on campus at 11:25 a.m, on 
a Monday, 

A number of cbanges to UCSD's 
parking and transportation system 
are aimed at improving all that. 
Brian d'Autremont, the new direc-
tor of Transportation and Parking 
ServiCes, has only been at UCSD for 
JO months, but his new programs 
are already garnering impressive 
results. 

Students probably already know 
about one program: the plan to offer 
discounts for site-specific permits 
for the East Campus lots. Because 
of their distance from campus, these 
lots are rarely ftlled to capacity. To 
get a feel for how many people might 
be interested in such a program, the 
department sent out a mass e-mail 

MONDAY, OCTOBER 23,2006 

on Oct. 20 to staff and faculty. By 
1 p.m . that day, hundreds of people 
had already e-mailed in reply. Due 
to the positive reply, d'Autremont 
expects to be able to move 1,200 
staff spots off of main campus, free-
ing those spots up to be reassigned 
for student parking. 

The San Diego public trans-

portation system is undergoing a 
series of changes, as well . Not only 
do students, faculty and staff have 
access to 38 add itional miles of free 
Metropolitan Transit System routes, 
but negotiations are currently under 
way with North County Transit to 
try to expand the route even fur-
ther. On top of those changes, there

Colleges across the country, including UCSD, are stocking up on the new vaccine against 
human papillomavirus, or HPV. But it comes at a price. 

By Matthew Leavitt 
ASSOCIATE FOCUS EDITOR 

I t seems that estimations dominate the medical world. Associations will tell you statis· 
tics that in and of themselves are 
interesting, but without context are 
hard to understand. According to 
the American Cancer Society, about 
3,700 women WIll die from cervi· 
cal cancer tbis year. According to 
tudent Health Services, four types 

of human papillomavirus, or HPY, 
cause about 70 percent of all cases 
of cervical cancer. . 

Accord ing to Debbie Pino· 
aballe tt, th.e di rector of health 

information at SHS. about 50 per· 
cent of sexually active people will 
contract HPV. more commonly 
known as genital warts, within their 
li fetimes. In an effort to keep UCSD 
students from becoming just anoth· 
er cancer statistic, SHS has begun 
offering the HPV vaccine at tbeir 
Nur es' Clinic. 

There arc aboul 30 different 
types of HPV that affect the geni· 
tal area, most of which are low· 
risk. Only a few are known to lead 
to cervical cancer or genital warts. 
However, regardless of sexual activ· 
ity. the vaccine i protection against 
cancer. 

HPv itself cannot be cured 
once contracted, but the vaccine 
can prevent against the other three 
high. risk stains if someone already 
has been infected with one. The 
vaccine is 100 percent effective in 
preventing the four strains of HPV

Ihat cau e cervical cancer - if the 
patient has not yet been exposed to 
the strains. 

The necessity of immunization 
before exposure sparked a debate 
between abstinence advocates and 
sexual health advocates while the 
vaccine was u ndergoing the FDA's 
approval process in early ' 2006. 
Abstinence advocates, worried that 
if younger gi rls are immunized 
before exposure then the vaccine 
can be seen as a green light to engage 
in exual intercour e because of the 
lowered risk of contracting HPV, 
ometimes discouraged its use and 

opposed making vaccination man · 
datory. 

But the immunizat ion process 
available at SHS con ists of three 
shots recommended for women 
between the ages of 9 and 26 years, 
and Pi no · aballett stressed the 
importance of receiving all three 
injections. Without all th ree. the 
vaccine is not 100 percent effec· 
tive. 

At $125 an injection, howev· 
er, it is not the effectiveness of 
the vaccine that is in question. 
Despite the costs imposed on stu· 
dents each year for enrollment in 
the Undergraduate Student Health 
Insurance Program, the new HPV 
treatment is among the services 
that are not insured. 

"Student health insurance does 
not cover [the shots J because it is 
such a new vaccine. ... It was just 
approved last June or July," Pino· 
SabaUell said, bringing the total cost 
of a full immunization to $375. In

is open co both men and women; no appointment is necessary to remve the ooa:ine. 

the future, she said, the Student 
Health Insurance Committee will 
look at the cost-benefit analysis of 
the vaccine and determine if it will 
be covered by S.H.I.P., but for now, 
students who want the vaccine must 
bear the brunt of the costs. 

The ambiguity surrounding the 

vaccine extends beyond its insur-
ancecoverage. Pino·SaballettcouJd 
not estimate the amount of vaccine 
ordered for UCSD, nor its expect-
ed demand from the students here. 
Doctor's offices are notoriously rife 
with waits and delays. It fits. then, 
that SHS, which has the normal 

problems of a doctor'. office com-
pounded with the unique issues 
of a university. is advenising the 
vaccine but baving trouble with 
its application to the campus. As 
with all new acquiliti6ns. it may 
tili time before SHS figures out 
the vaccine's place at VCSD.

Permit Sales Fall Short of Expectations 

Will PARSO NIGUMWIAN 
UCSD's shuttle system has been expanded beginning this year, offering extended routes for students who liveforther away from campus, and 
effectiuely outsourced student parking to many of those areas instead of to campus spats. 

• PARKING, from page 9 
the free bus route instead of driving 
a car to campus will save $4.000. 
on top of not buying a permit," said 
d'Autremont, referring to the costs 
of gas and car maintenance over an 
entire school year. 

But perhaps the most interesting 
program, and one that few students 
seem to be aware of. is the Flex Car 
program. For $9 an hour, which 
includes gas and insurance, stu· 
dents, faculty and staff can reserve 
one of the eight cars parked on or 
near campus. 

Unlike most rental car compa-
nies which require renters be at 
least 25 years of age and are thus 
inaccessible to most students, Flex 
Car is available to 18- to 2l ·year· 
olds. If the program succeeds, stu-
dents who live on campus could 
leave their cars at home but still 
maintain mobility in case of emer-
gencies, freeing up parking spaces 
that currently seem permanently 
occupied for commuter students. 
But anyone within reach of the 
campus, or the free bus zone, could 
also use these cars and avoid the 
hassle and cost of owning their 
own car. 

"We're the only campus in the 

country that has both the Flex Car 
and the Enterprise Rent-a-Car pro· 
gram; d'Autremont said. Both ser-
vices are available to aU students. 
regardless of age. 

Arguably, these programs have 
contributed to the parking office

permits last year are instead using 
alternate form s of transportation, 
such as the free bus route, according 
to d'Autremont. 

He also cited the 200 students 
who have joined the Rideshare pro· 
gram as a positive step in further 
reducing the number of cars tak· 
ing up "S· spots on campus. The 
Rideshare program is an amalgama. 
tion of ideas that include offering 
reduced-price permits to students 
who carpool to school together, and 
aWMding 10·day permits and free 
rentals of the Flex Car to students in 
the Pedal Club (students who bike 
to school) and the Transit Coaster 
Club. 

This decrease in the amount of 
permits sold and the 100 visitor 
spaces now available at Thornton 
Hospital have saved $4.6 million. 
that UCSD had expected to spend 
in order to build another parking 
structure, a result that d'Autremont 
is very happy with. 

"My goal is to never have to 
build another pa rking structure," 
d'Autremont said . He's adamant in 
his claim that the money, and that 
land, should instead be used for aca· 
demic pu rpose. "Because that's the 
reason we're all here." he said .

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAV, OCTOBER 23, 2006 

Courtney Contributes 14 Kills Over Coyotes 
• VOLLEYBALL, from page 16 

In the crucial must-win game four 
for the Trito'OS, they came out firing, 
taking a qUick 3-1 lead, only to see it 
evaporate a moment later. The' teams 
traded points for Ihe second straight 
game, but this time UCSD was able 
to pull away. 

With the score tied 23-23, the 
Tritons went on to close out the game 
30-25. Junior outside hitter Rebecca 
Bailey tallied the final three points 
with kills. 

In the decisive fifth game, the 
UCSD fans' voices began to rise again. 
Cal State San Bernardino exploded 
to a 9-5 start , silenCing the anxious 
crowd and forcing Black to call a 
timeout. 

"1 try to take each playas it comes,· 
Black said. "If a game goes well or if 
a game goes badly it comes back to 
pass, set, hit. 1 told the girls to focus 
and serve to the right person and we 
will win:' 

Bailey then recorded three blocks 
in a row, tying the game at 9-9. After 
kills by Koche and Bailey, the Coyotes 
called a timeout, down 11 - ) O. 

Cal State San Bernardino 
responded, getting a kiU out of the 
timeout and once again tying. the 
game. The Tritons regained the lead 
on a Bailey kill, 12-1 L Senior setter 
Kristen Halvorsen then put up two 
tough serves resulting in a bali-han -
dling error and an ace, solidifying 

ARASH KESHMIRIANIGUIIRDM N 
Senior outside hitter Nicole OJurtney led the Tritons in their victory over Cal State San 
Bernardino at UCSD on Oct. 21, ending the third-ranked OJyotes' undefeated season. 

the UCSD lead 14-11. 
After a Coyote attacking error, 

the students flooded the court, sur-
rounding their victorious women's 
volleyball team. 

"It's always fun to have the stu-
dents rush the court," Koche said. 
"We have to be good sports and slap 
[Cal State San Bernardino's 1 hands, 
but it was really exciting:' 

Senior outside hitter Nicole 
Courtney led the Triton squad with 
13 kills and 29 digs. Bailey and 
Koche added 13 kills apiece. 

"This team has an unbelievable 
amount of character," Black said. 
"After those first couple of losses ear-
lier in the season, the team has real -
ly responded with the wins at Chico 
[Statel, [Cal State Los Angeles] and 
now last night's match against an 
undefeated tea m. There's no quit in 
these girls and they never s top fight -
ing. It's grati fying to watch." 

Often t imes, the game before 
such a big match can prove to be 
problematic because the fo cus is 
on the upcoming game. However, 
UCSD took care of business on Oct. 

20 by defeating Cal Poly Pomona 30-
20, 30-28, 28-30, 30-21. 

Courtney recorded a near triple-
double with 12 kills, 14 digs and 
nine aces. 

"Nicole's a great player; when 
she's on her game, she'll play well 
against anyone," Black said. "She's 
worked hard to get to t he level she's 
at and tonight was just what it looks 
like when she's executing:' 

ere's no quit in 
!Lese girls and they 

never stop fight-
ing. It's gratifying to 

watch?' 
- Tom Black, 
Head Coach 

The Tritons jumped out to ~ 7-
o lead in game one on four aces 
by Courtney. Cal Poly Pomona 
never got closer than eight as UCSD 
cruised to a 30-20 win. 

Game two proved to be a bit more 
difficult as Cal Poly Pomona often 
took a nine-point lead in the match . 
Sophomore outside hitter Michelle 

Torres then led a furious comeback 
as UCSD scored six straight points to 
pull within three at 23-20. 

The Tritons then tied the match 
24-24 and Bailey sent down the final 
two kills, giving UCSD the comeback 
win 30-28. 

In game three, UCSD opened a 27-
23 lead before Cal Poly Pomona made 
a co'meback of its own, tying the game 
28-28. Two Triton attacking errors 
later, Cal Poly Pomona forced a fourth 
game, winning the third 28-30. 

"We knew were going to win, but 
it was just one more game than we 
would've liked," Koche said. 

The Tritons got back on track in 
the fourth game as they built a 14-7 
advantage. The lead stretched to 22-10 
before Cal Poly Pomona was able to 
cut the it back to 23-16. It was the last 
ray of hope as UCSD closed out the 
match on sophomore middle blocker 
Hannah Gary's kill. 

The women only have four games 
left in the regular season before pl.ay-
offs begin. The team is back in action 
Oct. 25 at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 

"It's really important to train 
with the end in mind," Black said. 
"Of course we need to focus on the 
moment and the next game, but we 
still need to see the bigger picture. 
There has to be a sense of urgency 
and the team does a great job of 
that."

MONDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2006 THE UCSD CUARDIAN SPORT 15 

Hard-Hitting Rugby Eyes Nationals .Berth No Rest Ahead for No.5 
Tritons on Road at Davis • RUGBY, from page 16 Anthony Gannon earned the first 

try for the Tritons, eight minutes 
into the first half. 

Fellow junior fullback Will 
Cowell followed with a kick con-
version, which was his first of four 
on the day. Junior trop Tyler Barret 
then contributed two tries just 
before halftime to make the score 
21 -0. 

Point Lorna Nazarene University 
seemed to get back on track as it 
controlled the ball for the early 
part of the second half and scored 
a try, but missed the kick conver-
sion. 

That score se-emed to wake the 
Tritons up again, as they proceeded 
to shut the Sea Lions down for the 
rest of the game. 

The remainder of the half 
looked very much like the first half 
with the Tritons in control of the 
ball and in their opponent's terri -
tory. Junior outside center Kevin 
O'Leary found himself in the try 
zone for the team's only points in 
the second half. 

According to Cherwink, Barret 
carried the Tritons to victory. 

"Tyler was unstoppable today," 
Cherwink said. "He was running 
over people and no one could stop 
him ." 

Following a somewhat medio-
cre season, due to injuries and a 
small roster, the Tritons aim to 
erase last year's memories with a 
raised bar of expectations for th is 
year's team. 

"As opposed to last year, we 
have a larger rookie class," junior 
serum half Brady Ruebusch said. 
"We have more players and have a 
big and solid team. This year we've 
revamped our method of playing 
guys. It's going to be a new sea-
son." 

With two early preseason wins, 
the Tritons have high expectations

we can, we have a legitimate shot at 
making the playoffs. But we have

it won't be easy." 

Only the top two teams from the 
league will go on to the nationals, 

and the Tritons are optimistic that 
they will be contenders. 

"r think it's the best team in the 
four years I've been here," Cherwink 
said. "Cal Poly [San Luis Obispo) 
and [UC) Santa Barbara will be our 
main competition. r expect us to 
compete for that second seed." 

The Tritons are back in action 
on Oct. 28 at 1 p.m. at the Rookie 
Tournament hosted by the University 
of San Diego.

Senior two-meter offense Ty Lackey 

led the Tritons with six goals, includ-
ing five straight in the second quar-
ter. Senior driver Adnan Jerkovic and 
freshman two-meter offense Daniel 
Garcia each netted two goals for the 
Tritons. 

"Ty Lackey and Adnan Jerkovic 
were unstoppable today," Harper said. 
"I could have played those guys all 
match and they would have domi-
nated." 

Lackey's six goals pushed his 
team-leading total to 47 on the year, 
while Jerkovic's two strikes gave him 
29 on the season. 

Randall attributed the easy victory 
to the Tritons' superior work ethic 
and team speed. 

"[Pomona-Pitzer] is a big team 
but they are slow," Randall said. "We 
watched a lot of film on them and 
knew that we were much quicker and 
we were able to exploit that the entire 

match." 
After a string of close matches, 

Harper ~as happy to get an easy win. 
" [Pomona-Pitzer] looked like 

they were not up for the challenge~ 
Harper said. "It was kind of a relief 
to not have a stressful game; it was a 
great team effort." 

The win pushed UCSD's record 
to 19-4 overall and 10-0 in Western 
Water Polo Association play, and the 
Tritons remain 6-0 at home. Pomona-
Pitzer, which came into the match 
ranked No. 2 in the NCAA Division 
III standings, now holds a record of 
8-13. 

The Tritons look to defend their 
perfect conference recora on the road

Bump Win 
Streak to 10 
Women's volleyball 
continues impressive 
run, beating Cal Poly 
Pomona and Cal State 
San Bernardino.

STAF F WRITER 

Often times match ups between 
two top-notch programs fall short 
of expectations and are uncharacter-
istically one-sided, but the Oct. 21 
match between No. 3 Cal State San 
Bernardino and No. 12 UCSD did not 
fa il to deliver an impressive. perfor-
mance - a five-game marathon that 
lasted just over two-and-a-half hours. 

"We've been training really hard 
ever since the end of last year, so 
we weren't worried about going five 
games," senior middle blocker Brianna 
Koche said. "We were fitter and you 
could see that they got tired:' 

The Coyotes were trying to pre-
erve a flawless record while the 

Tritons were attempting to move up 
the rankings and establish themselves 
as a premier squad. 

"They're the best team in the 
region and it's good to know you can 
win at that level:' head coach Tom 
Black said. "We've said the entire year 
that if we execute, we can win, and 
the ladies really believe in that right 
now." 

A reported 1,009 cheering fans 
witnessed UCSD's defeat over Cal 
State San Bernardino 30-19, 23-30, 
29-31, 30-25, 15-11 -and .contributed 
added motivation to the Triton play-
ers. 

"[The fans] were awesome:' Koche 
said. "Right as the match was about to 
start, about 10 guys with their chests 
painted came in chanting 'UCSD' and 
it really got us pumped up. It's more 
exciting to play in front of a crowd 
like that:' 

RlMAC Arena buzzed with antici-
pation of the upset as the first serve 
was hit and play got underway. UCSD 
took the lead early, 8-3, on junior 
libero Natalie Facchini's back-to-back 
aces. 

The advantage was stretched to 
23-10 after a Coyote attacking error. 
Koche's kill sent the fans into a craze 
as UCSD took the first game 30-19. 

In game two, Cal State San 
Bernardino bounced right back. The 
Tritons kept it tight early on, but the 

oyotes were able to pull away after 
taking the lead 9-8. Cal State San 
Bernardino went on a 16-7 run from 
there to take command and eventually 
won the game 23-30. 

The Tritons fe ll behind 5-8 in game 
three before tying it 10- 10 on a Coyote 
attack error. Neither team could take 
control, exchanging points without a 
clear lead on either side. 

With the score tied 28-28, the 
crowd erupted a freshman middle 
blocker Sylvia chmidt got a block 
to put UCSD lip -29-28, giving the 
Tritons an opportunity to erve out 
the third game. 

Cal tate an Bernardino showed 
why it is the third-ranked team in the 
cOlin try as it battled back, scoring the 
next three points, causing the Tritons 
fall to 29-31 and quieting the UCSD 
crowd. 

"None of us were nervous and 
we knew we had to win [the fourth 
game]," Koche aid. "We knew if it 
went five we would win because we 
were more fit."

Backed by impressive individual 
performances, the UCSD men's and 
women's cross country teams plac~d

Athletic Association championships 
held at UCSD on Oct. 21. The meet

nated the meet, comming away with 
both the men's and women's cham-
pionships. 

Chico State's top men took first, 
second and third place while their 
top women took first, second and 
fifth. It was the men's team fifth 
straight championship and the 
women's fourth in five years. 

"It was a little surprising how 
fast they raced, but we always expect 
[Chico State] to have a strong show-
ing:' junior captain Diane Dunn 
said .. 

In addition to the Wildcats' 
dominant performances, Chico 
State head coach Gary Towne was 
also awarded the Most Valuable 
Coach of the Year awards for both

Although the UCSD men's team 
did not place as high as it had 
hoped, freshman Max Mullender

After a ~ries of tough matches 
at the annual Southern California 
Tournament, the UCSD men's water 
polo team was looking to reassert its 
dominance against Pomona-Pitzer 
Colleges at Canyonview Pool on Oct. 
21. The No. 5 Tritons had already 

won a match against the Sagehens 
this year, on a 21 -5 win at the Inland 
Empire Tournament on Sept. 9. 

The focused Tritons squad wast-
ed no time attacking Pomona-Pitzer, 
jumping out to a 10-0 lead early in 
the match. 

"We had a lot of energy and we 
wanted to come out and show that 
it was not going to be easy play-
ing us," ~nior goalkeeper Jeremy 
Randall said. "We were in better 
shape and wanted to come out and 
make a statement after a tough loss 
to UCLA." 

By halftime, the Tritons held an 
11-1 advantage and looked to give 
everybody on the team solid min-

utes in the pool. 
The ~cond halfofthe match fea-

tured fewer goals than the ons.laught 
of the first and ~cond quarters, but 
the Tritons nonetheless cruised to a 
14-3 victory. 

Head coach Denny Harper was 
pleased that the Tritons rebound-
ed from the grueling Southern 
California Tournament with a strong 
showing against Pomona-Pitzer. 

"We had a great workout on 
Friday and the team responded well," 
Harper said · We wanted to make 
sure we did not overlook Pomona-
Pitzer:' 

[ ROUT, p.15) 

MuUender said. "What we expected 
to do on an OK day was to hope-
fully beat [Cal Poly Pomona), but 
we'U get them at regionals." 

The Triton men finished 61 
points behind Chico State and 32 
points behind Cal Poly Pomona, 
with the winning time of 25 min-
utes, 44.9 ~conds coming from 
Chico State senior Charlie Serrano. 

The Triton ...women were not 
able to defend their 2005 CCAA 
championship, but they placed 
third behind good races from Dunn 
and senior Nina Miller. Dunn and 
Miller placed fourth and sixth, 
respectively. 

"[Dunn and Miller] did a real-
ly nice job working through the 
course together," assistant coach 
Nate Garcia said. 

Dunn's finish was a much-wel-
comed improvement from past 
years. 

"I'm happy about how I fin-
ished," Dunn said. "For the past 
two years, I've finished ninth and I 
wasn't about to repeat that." 

In addition to placing sixth, 
MuUender received the Freshman 
of the Year award, decided by the 
coaches of the seven CCAA teams. 

"I was surprised," Mullender 
said. "I expected [freshman Jessie 
Morrill) to get the award." 

Mullender's finish was the 
highest out of all freshmen racers. 
Morrill also had a strong race, plac-
ing 17th for the Tritons. 

"Max really stepped up and 
engaged with some of the better 
runners in the country," Garcia said. 
"He handled the race very well" 

With the regional champion-
ship meet coming up in less than 
two weeks, both teams have their

With tackles so hard that the 
flesh-on-flesh impact could be heard 
from across the field, the UCSD 
men's rugby team defeated Point 
Lorna Nazarene University 28-5 in 
its second game of the preseason. 
The win improved the team's pre-
season record to 2-0. 

The Tritons dominated from the 
first minute of the game, scoring 
21 points in the fint half. Despite 
a less-than-impressive second-half 
showing, head coach Tim O'Hara 
was pleased with his team's perfor-
mance. 

"I thought we played really weU 
in the first half but let up a little in 
the second," O'Hara said. "This is 
only the second game of the pre-
season, so I'm not worried." 

Senior captain and inside cen-
ter Nik Cherwink echoed O'Hara's 
sentiment. 

"I think we displayed real good 
teamwork," Cherwink said. ·We 
played as one team rather than 15 
individual members." 

During the first half, the Tritons 
were relentless at keeping the ball 
in the Sea Lions' half of the field.

wards pulled off one strons pin
