Starting next academic year, students can 
postpone worrying about finding off-cam-
pus housing for one more year. According 
to Housing, Dining and Hospitality Services 
Director Mark Cunningham, the HDH 
department plans to extend the on-campus 
housing guarantee for qualified students to 3 
years, starting Fall 2011. 

This new contract is possible because 
of several on-campus housing projects cur-
rently being built, including Phase Two of 
the transfer housing complex The Village. 

“With the completion of these proj-
ects, the campus 
will extend a 3-year 
housing guaran-
tee to all incoming 
freshmen starting 
in 2011-12 — a first 
for UC San Diego,” 
Cunningham said. 

In addition, 
Cunningham said 
his department is 
working to provide a 
guarantee of 2 years 
of on-campus hous-
ing to all incoming 
transfer students. 

The additional housing is part of the 
UC Office of the President initiative to 
decrease the number of commuter students. 
According to Capital Planning Director Cara 
Fladd, the goal is to house 50 percent of stu-
dents on campus.

Currently, there are four student hous-
ing projects in the works. Muir College and 
Revelle College are expanding the number 
of rooms in their apartments to house 275 
undergraduate students and 510 sopho-
more and upperclassmen, respectively. The 
Rita Atkinson Residences at the School of 
Medicine campus currently being built will 
house additional graduate and professional 
students.

In addition, The Village at Torrey Pines 
East is under construction and will provide 
housing for 800 upperclassmen.

The first phase, The Village at Torrey 
Pines West, was finished in May 2009 and 
officially opened January 2010. The project 
was in development for 2 years and cost $12 
billion. As with all student housing, funding 
comes from University of California Long 
Term Revenue Bonds approved four years 
ago.

This past Wednesday, UCSD cele-brated an accomplishment almost 6 years in the making when it 
became the first school in California (and 
the second in the nation after University 
of Wisconsin-Oshkosh) to become fair 
trade certified. 

The honor came as a result of a newly 
signed fair trade policy, meant to increase 
human rights by ensuring that farmers 
who produce products like coffee receive 

a fair living wage. The policy — drafted 
and signed by administrators, campus 
vendors and members of the student 
organization One Earth One Justice — 
came into effect June 14.

According to the policy, vendors are 
required to sell only fair trade coffee, tea 
and sugar. Vendors who sell chocolate, ice 
cream, grains and quinoa are required to 
make one of the above available in a fair 
trade option. The policy also allows for 
future university expansion into other fair 
trade products, if and when they become 
available. 

At the ceremony in Mandeville, mem-
bers and alumni of OEOJ, founded in the 
fall of 2004, were recognized as major 
driving forces behind the on-campus 
fair trade movement. Since its inception, 
OEOJ has been fighting to broaden the 
presence of fair trade products on campus. 

The organization is almost singlehand-
edly responsible for raising the amount of 
fair trade tea, coffee and sugar on campus 
from zero to 64 percent in 5 years. With 
the new policy in place, members expect 
this number to rise to 100 percent. 

The battle began 6 years ago, when the 
group was decided to focus on expand-
ing fair trade options to all the vendors 
on campus. Having, with the exception 
of Fairbanks Coffee, accomplished this 
goal, members began work on a university 
policy that would make it mandatory for 
all on-campus vendors to carry fair trade 
coffee, tea and sugar.

 “We sat down and hashed out what 
would be a reasonable policy based on 
the availability of fair trade products and 
their price,” OEOJ core member and

LastingÊWeightÊLossÊPossibleÊWithÊPre-PackagedÊMeals
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Aurora Le
Staff Writer

A 2-year study conducted by 
Moores Cancer Center confirmed 
the weight loss claims of at least one 
major diet company. 

In the trial, researchers provided 
a randomized clinical trial of 442 
overweight or obese women age 18 
to 69 with free pre-packaged meals, a 
structured weight loss program and 
long-term counseling. The results 
showed that long-lasting weight loss 
is feasible. 

“We provided the program with-
out charge,” principal investigator 
Dr. Cheryl L. Rock of the Moores 
Cancer said. “This is what we call 
a ‘proof of principle study’. Not 
enough research has been done with 
independent researches putting diet 
program to the test, so we did a ran-
domized clinical trial of Jenny Craig 
to see if it actually works.”

The women were sorted into 
three intervention groups — in-per-
son, center-based or telephone — all 

of whom received weekly one-to-one 
weight loss counseling and free pre-
packaged prepared foods from the 
popular weight loss program Jenny 
Craig, Inc. 

The third group received two 
individualized weight loss counsel-
ing sessions with dietitians who kept 
in monthly contact.  All three groups 
eventually moved to a meal plan that 
was not based off Jenny Craig. 

The additional incentive for 
returning for check-ups was a mon-
etary compensation of $25 mon-
etary compensation for each com-
pleted clinic visit. 

Over this 2-year period, there 
were follow-up appointments 
between November 2007 and 2010 
to check the progress of the par-
ticipants. 

Rock and her team also encour-
aged the subjects to increase physi-
cal activity to 30 minutes a day, 
whether it be at a gym, walking 
around their neighborhood or any 
other recreational activity.

“There were no drugs involved 

in this study or any procedures 
performed,” Rock said. “It [weight 
loss] is just a matter of changing 
behaviors in diet and exercise, eat-
ing sensibly and having structured 
meals.” 

After 2 years, the data showed 
that women in the center-based 
group were able to lose an average 
of 16 lbs. from their initial weight, 
the women in the telephone-based 
group were able to lose 14 lbs. and 
the control group lost 4 lbs.

“Anyone who is sincerely try-
ing to lose weight should find this 
study to be very encouraging,” Rock 
said. “With moral support, motiva-
tion and a willing to change there 
is hope, and it can be done without 
drugs or surgery.” 

Rock plans to conduct further 
research on how weight loss can 
affect and increase the chances for 
survival for women who have been 
diagnosed with breast cancer. 

Beginning in the spring, she will 
launch a study that uses one’s phy-
sique and metabolism to create more 

individualized plans. 
“One size doesn’t fit all,” Rock 

said in term’s of people’s abilities to 
change their lifestyle and weight. 
“No two people are the same and 
that’s why everyone cannot have the 
same weight-loss plan and have it be 
effective.” 

This study was published in the 
Journal of the American Medical 
Association.

A.S. Council will appoint two 
remaining associate vice presidents 
next week, after failing to approve a 
full cabinet last spring and extending 
the application process to encourage 
new candidates. 

Last spring, council failed to 
appoint all 10 of the associate vice 
presidents, who are cabinet mem-
bers in charge of managing various 
aspects of student life. 

In particular, A.S. President Wafa 
Ben Hassine’s candidates for the 
offices of college affairs, academic 
affairs and student advocacy were not 
approved. 

The AVP of College Affairs serves 
as a liaison between students, college 
councils and the A.S. Council, while 
the AVP of Academic Affairs works 
on creating university academic pol-
icy. The AVP of Student Advocacy is 

responsible for defending students’ 
rights in university disputes. 

The candidates appointed to 
these positions —  former AVP of 
Local Affairs Aries Yumul, former 
Campuswide Senator Desiree Prevo 
and Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Arohi Sharma, respectively — were 
instead hired on a temporary basis 
until Week Four. 

According to A.S. protocol, by 
Week Four the candidates must reap-
ply and be reappointed and approved. 

However, Ben Hassine decided 
last week to delay associate vice 
president appointment to extend the 
application period.

“The application went online a 
few weeks ago, and was only open 
for a week,” Ben Hassine said. “Sixth 
College Senator Parminder Sandhu 
said it should be up for at least two 
weeks, so we opened up the applica-
tion process again.”

In an e-mail to the A.S. listserv 

on Oct. 4, Sandhu expressed concern 
that there was not enough time to 
publicize the positions —  which are 
paid $3,500 per year — and for inter-
ested candidates to apply.

“There simply could be no way 
that applications for such important 
positions would only be up for less 
than five days on the A.S. website,” he 
wrote. “These two positions are some 
of the most important positions that 
the A.S. council offers, and they cer-
tainly merit more than four days of 
notice to potential applicants.”

Though the applications were 
reopened, and closed on Oct. 22, Ben 
Hassine said there have been no other 
applicants other than Yumul, Prevo 
and Sharma. 

Interviews will be conducted next 
week and the new associate vice pres-
idents will be appointed by Nov. 3.

In May 2009, A.S. Transfer 
Student Senator Adam Powers said 
200 of the 1,060 beds available were 
not being used due to its high costs.

Powers said the complex was not 
a popular choice to live in because 
it was not an affordable place to live 
— rent at The Village costs between 
$1,200 and $1,400 each month. 

However, UCSD spokesperson 
Christine Clark said that, as of Fall 
2010, all space in The Village and on-
campus housing is filled.

Currently, The Village at Torrey 
Pines East is under construction and 
is scheduled to open in Spring 2011, 
when it will house about 800 upper-
classmen.

According to Cunningham, the 
university is in the final stage of con-
struction and completion of the new 
transfer-housing unit is scheduled for 
Feb. 1, 2011. 

This project was initiated in 

response to the 2005 Undergraduate 
Student Experience Report survey. 

In the survey, students recom-
mended that the campus have more 
housing options because on-cam-
pus housing builds community and 
allows access to the university and its 
surrounding neighborhoods. 

“[The new structure] will be one 
of the most innovative and energy-
efficient student housing complex-
es,” Cunningham said. “The unique 
design of the five residential and two 
mixed-use buildings allows the ocean 
breeze to come up through the com-
plex’s hallways and dorms, removing 
the need for air conditioning.” 

A computer model was used to 
determine the orientation of the 
building to maximize ocean breeze. 

As a result, the buildings are slant-
ed, with openings facing west to elim-
inate the need for air conditioning.  
Cunningham added that the proj-
ect is reaching completion 7 months 

ahead of schedule. Phase Two of the 
Village will include a market — simi-
lar to the ones present in Phase One 
— as well as a restaurant and new 
meeting rooms. 

The university is also trying to 
achieve LEED (Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design) Gold 
certification for the new building, 
which means the buildings meet sus-
tainability performance requirements 
such as energy savings, water effi-
ciency and carbon dioxide emission 
reductions. Phase Two of The Village 
already fulfills LEED Silver certifica-
tion.

The housing structure will be 
apartment style, with two doubles 
and two singles in each apartment. 
In addition, solar panels, costing an 
additional $1.4 million, will be used 
on the roofs to provide hot water.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG/OPINIONMONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 2010

These days, it seems like we can do anything online — we can shop, socialize and even date via the Internet. Not to be outdone, higher education has also hopped aboard the information superhighway. Blackboard, an educational software company, and 
K12, a company that allows students to attend kindergarten through high school online, 
have announced that, starting next year they’ll design remedial online courses taught by 
K12 instructors and will be sold to community colleges. And while many accredited online 
universities like Kaplan and the University of Phoenix have found massive success in offering 
online education and fulfill a certain niche, it’s dangerous to blur the line between them and 
public community colleges. Outsourcing tech-support might cut corporations’ costs, but the 
only thing that will be cut when outsourcing college courses to corporations will be the qual-
ity of education. This is the first time a private educational company will attempt to package 
and sell an entire course, instead of just the facilitating software. 

Blackboard and K12 decided to create these classes to help students “catch up,” basing 
their curriculum off the assumption that community college professors “are not there to 
teach high school English and math.” But these reasons are exactly why community colleg-
es shouldn’t reach out to the private sector. If students are struggling with remedial English 
and math, according to King’s College School of Education, a sole reliance on online edu-
cation is “seriously flawed in principle because [it does] not encompass a consideration of 
learning issues.” 

It’s true that Blackboard and K12’s new class system could eliminate some of the stress 
community colleges face with remedial students. According to the U.S. Department of 
Education, 42 percent of students at community colleges must take at least one remedial 
class; with such a large percentage of community college students taking remedial courses, 
it’s not hard to see why a community college would want to take the stress of designing 
curriculum and providing such classes off the table. It’d save the colleges both time and 
money to outsource their remedial students to the Blackboard’s open arms, but it’s not as 
straightforward as outsourcing tech-support to India. We’re dealing with higher education. 
When creating systems for something as valuable as education, our community colleges 
shouldn’t pass the buck to private companies for the sake of convenience. 

The students signing up for remedial courses are the students that need more personal-
ized attention than the run-of-the-mill college co-ed. They’re not taking remedial classes 
because they want to impress with “relevant coursework” — they’re taking it because 

When I changed my rela-tionship status from “single” to “in a relation-
ship” last week, it didn’t occur to me 
that everyone and their mother would 
see it — including my own. During 
my next phone call with my mom, she 

asked how Brett was doing. 
“Brett? He’s great. I’m surprised 

you remembered his name, I’ve only 
mentioned him a few times.” 

“Well, apparently you’re in a rela-
tionship with him.” 

This was unreal. Facebook told 
my mother that I’m in a relationship. 
Facebook also told her my plans for 
Saturday night. She warned me that 
when I’m ready to get married, she 
expected to find out in person, not by 
reading “Madeline Mann is engaged” 
on her newsfeed.

This finally made it real how big of 
a deal being “Facebook Official” really 
is. You are declaring, to your entire 
world, that you are in a relationship 
with someone, allowing each of your 
hundreds of friends to click the name 
of your new significant other, judge 
your selection and conjecture how 
long you’ll last.  

At the summer camp I worked at 
last year, one of my coworkers fool-
ishly posted on Facebook that he was 
in a relationship with a camper. Smart, 
right? The 17-year-old counselor and 
15-year-old camper could have dated 
in real life without any real reper-
cussions, but because of the virtual 
announcements, the situation blew up. 
As rumor has it; he’s not being hired 
again next year. All because of a silly 
relationship status.

Changing your status to “In a 
Relationship,” means living out your 
relationship in the public eye. Not 
only will everyone see when you’re 
“official,” but also when you break up 
— along with the string of “omg, I’m 
so sorry!”s from your friends. 

Not to mention, breaking up 
through a changed relationship status 
has become the all-time lowest way 
of getting dumped (it even beats the 
20-character text). Worse yet is the 
story of Emma Brady, who found out 
through a Facebook update that her 
marriage of 12 years was over. 

This one Facebook option is 
rocking our love lives. People use it 
to project their most desired image, 
just as men upload pictures of them 
standing with a bunch of girls to seem 
more desired (but we know the truth 
— those are his cousins). Friends jok-
ingly say they are “married” to make 
themselves look like they are not 
living poor, desolate love lives. Being 
“engaged” to your BFF has become the 
adorable thing to do, but even then, 
when someone breaks off that fake 
relationship in exchange for a real one, 
feelings are hurt. 

By announcing a couple’s com-
mitment to each other, Facebook 
adds pressure to young relationships 
by making it so public (even if it’s the 
pressure that many girls want and have 
been asking for). It’s a way of making 
things real. When college students find 
someone that makes them smile — 
despite the three midterms they have 
yet to study for — they want legitima-
cy, or at least proof that it won’t vanish 
tomorrow. It’s the modern equivalent 
of getting “pinned” in the 1950s, 
where the man pins his school pin to 
his lady’s cardigan to show the world 
she’s taken. Pins are too old school for 
our generation, so instead we turn to 
what we know best: the Internet. It’s 
emotional security; and this security is 
certainly case sensitive.

The recent discovery that Facebook applications are dispensing personal information to dozens of third-party advertising com-panies isn’t the first to make the multi-billion-dollar social network the subject of controversy. And while surely it’s not the last, 
we shouldn’t worry. 

Every few months, there’s another late-breaking story on how Facebook has, in some shape or form, breached our privacy rights. 
But there have been no mass movements of outraged citizens deleting their Facebook accounts. Instead, we trusted—and rightfully 
so — that Facebook would handle the situation. 

Last week, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that his website will develop technology to combat the 
problem of personal IDs being leaked. He also mentioned that Facebook would take immediate action to disable all apps that vio-
late its terms. The issue certainly can’t be addressed overnight, but Zuckerberg’s promise should be enough to calm privacy-con-
scious Facebookers all over the globe — at least until the next debacle the website encounters. After all, each time its Internet safety 
was repeatedly and publicly compromised, Facebook enhanced its privacy settings accordingly.

Besides, it’s highly unlikely that addicted FarmVille players will ditch their virtual cows and sheep anytime soon, crisis or no. We 
can only hope that the newest privacy problem gets the same speedy response as all the others. Until then, Facebook knows it can 
count on its users to keep coming back. 

In Facebook We Trust

It’s time to realize that nothing on the Internet will ever be truly private. We can  complain about the lack of security until our jaws fall off, but that won’t change the fact that it is possible to recover anything posted on the Internet, no matter how long ago 
it was deleted. 

Regardless of how private our profile pages get, anything posted in cyberspace is vulnerable.  This can be more revealing than 
we’d like, as the Facebook ads targeted toward gay men has taught us. Innocently clicking on these ads has larger ramifications, by 
telling the advertiser the IP address and sexual orientation of the reader.  

This lack of Facebook security sucks, it’s true. But when we write an angry wall post about our boss on a coworker’s wall, we 
can’t expect that it’ll stay private. Likewise, with the Internet so open and unsecured, it’s irrational to expect our information to stay 
sealed in a box. Instead, anticipate that anything and everything posted online can make it into the wrong hands.

As long as Facebook exists, there are going to be privacy breaches. The only true way to protect ourselves is by not posting 
anything online that we don’t want our mom, boss and professors to see. While it’s easy to blame Facebook when scandalous docu-
ments end up in the wrong hands, we have to take responsibility for what we post. Instead of relying on the company to protect our 
privacy rights, we must take matters into our own hands and consciously monitor what we post.

The day that Facebook develops a 100 percent privacy guarantee will be the day I decide to post those outrageous photos from 
Sun God. But until then, I am keeping them under lock and key on my hard drive.

Facebook Can’t Share What You Don’t Post

It’s easy to get outraged at Facebook for releasing private information to third parties every time we innocently click “allow” on applications.  Instead, try embracing it with open arms. 
Facebook assures us that, although third parties do have access to some of our information — like our relationship statuses or 

tastes in music — the information is not misused in any way. 
There’s little personal danger.  I’ve spent the past few years being bombarded with ads for muscle milk and V8 engines.  Now 

that it’s common knowledge that I “like” fashion, third party advertisers can cater their ads to me.  If we’re going to be forced to see 
advertisements on our sidebars, they might as well be for things we’re actually interested in.

We live in a world that is saturated with advertisements. Everywhere we go, we pass advertisements, both blatant and deceptive-
ly subtle. Whatever the method, there’s little we can do to escape their presence in American culture. Instead of making a fuss about 
how personal the personalized ads on Facebook have gotten, we should welcome the tailor-made attention.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
UCSD Chancellor Marye Anne 

Fox: Does she know what a univer-
sity is? And you, if you do want a 
university, are you willing to pay for 
it? University libraries are reduc-
ing the number of journals. Many 
staff members on contract are los-
ing their jobs. The new National 
Science Medal winner’s compensa-
tion as a director of Pharmaceutical 
Product Development, Inc. for 2007 
was $181,917. The UCSD Chancellor 
has been a director of Boston 
Scientific since 2001 ($201,407). Dr. 
Fox has served as the Co-Chair of 
the National Academy of Sciences’ 
Government-University-Industry 
Research Roundtable and she served 
on President Bush’s Council of 
Advisors on Science and Technology. 
She also is a member of the boards of 
directors of Red Hat Corp. ($222,500), 
W.R. Grace Co. ($164,000) and 
the Camille and Henry Dreyfus 
Foundation.  

Industry-funded research is over-
whelmingly more likely to favor spon-
sor’s interests compared to research by 
non-profits or government sources.

The most important issue is access 
to higher education. That, of course, 
means diverting public funds toward 
the higher education sector. 

What is a university education 
worth? Who derives the benefits? And 
who should pay for it? These were 
just some of the questions that pushed 
their way onto the UT front pages 
recently.  It is high time Qualcomm 
stock be awarded to the University 
of California to pay for the depreda-
tions of former UCSD Chancellor 
Richard C. Atkinson, among others.

Dear Editor,
The name “Tea Party” is perfect 

(because it means nothing) for the 
intentionally dishonest, immoral and 
deceptive corporate-run Reactionary 
& Irrational Republican (C-RIR) Party, 
which has netted $500 million from 
anonymous corporations that are 
motivated solely by profits. They want 
to rule America via a previously illegal 
route rendered possible by five politi-
cally motivated, Republican-appointed 
Supreme Court Justices. As Democrat 
Baron P. Hill correctly enunciated 
during a debate with his C-RIR oppo-
nent:  “Climate change is real, and man 
is causing it.” Virtually all evidence pro-
duced over the past 50 years by climate 
change scientists supports this conclu-
sion. Yet Norman Dennison, a C-RIR 
co-founder, responded:  “It’s an outright 
lie,” adding revealingly that he based 
this conclusion on “Rush Limbaugh 
and [his interpretation of] the teach-
ings of Scripture.” Do Californians and 
the US want rational government led 
by common sense, logic and scientific 
inquiry, or do they prefer one that 
practices a policy of lies and deception 
motivated by ignorance and corporate 
greed? We can choose on November 2, 
2010. Let’s reject the C-RIR party alto-
gether!  (Based on an article, “Climate 
Change Doubt is Tea Party Article of 
Faith” by John M. Broder, New York 
Times, Oct. 20, 2010)

DRAWING FIRE By Johan De La Torre

they need extra help. By eliminat-
ing personalized 
instruction and 
ignoring differ-
ent learning styles, 
Blackboard and K12 
are creating a one-
size-fits-all solution 
for a problem that 
comes in infinite 
shapes and sizes. By 
outsourcing their 
remedial classes 
to Blackboard and 
K12, community colleges are elimi-
nating the individual attention, office 
hours and varied explanations that 
only a human can provide.

Another glaring problem our 
community colleges must take into 

consideration is that Blackboard 
and K12 are private companies, 

and as such, their 
primary motiva-
tion is their own 
pocketbooks. It’s a 
conflict of interest 
for Blackboard and 
K12 to be selling 
both an education 
and the course 
texts. When a col-
lege puts an entire 
course in the hands 
of a private com-
pany, the private 

company has a complete monopoly 
on the materials the students need 
to buy. Instead of perusing various 
used bookstores and www.Half.com 
for the cheapest textbooks, students 

could be forced to buy books that 
are only distributed by the com-
pany, at any price the company 
chooses. 

When assessing whether com-
munity colleges should join forces 
with Blackboard and K12, they need 
to remember their end goal: to give 
the highest possible quality educa-
tion to every student that passes 
through their doors. While it might 
be more convenient in the short run 
to ship students off to money-hun-
gry private corporations, in the long 
run, the priorities must lie in ensur-
ing the best education they can pro-
vide — by any means necessary.

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

We may have outgrown trick-or-treating, but for those 
interested in dodging the typical booze-and-slutty-costume 
fare, The Haunted Hotel — located 25 minutes away from 
UCSD in the Gaslamp District — may be the perfect solu-
tion. Open from Sept. 24 to Oct. 31 (7 p.m. - 11 p.m. on 
Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday and 6 p.m. - 1 a.m. on 
Friday and Saturday), this walk-through freakshow is the 
longest running haunted house in San Diego, and was fea-
tured on Travel Channel’s “America Haunts IV” in 2009.

From the outside, the supposed “hell on earth” doesn’t 
look much different from the lame Subway next door. 
The only tip off to its fright potential is the line stretching 
down the street. In Disney-gone-mad style, several morbid-
looking characters — covered in ripped, blood-soaked shirts 
— taunt the patrons, at the same time providing a distraction 
from the painful wait (fast passes are an extra 10 bucks). 

It may be a sneak preview of the much-anticipated hor-
ror, but the sidewalk version of the B-movie shtick — fake 
chainsaws, “boos” and all — repels cynics and innocents 
alike.  For the patient: Once through the line, you’re forced 
to spend a steep $17 and are subjected to a quick recap of the 
rules (no touching the actors, no photos) and liability issues 
(if you faint, it ain’t their problem). 

Once it’s finally your group’s chance to scream, you get 
your very own creeper as your escort. A woman with dishev-
eled hair or a mad scientist leads you through the rickety 

elevator, where, surprise, the tour starts with a fright. The 
window in the elevator is jerked open by a man covered in 
scars (a “shocking” turn of events), and as you begin your 
walk down the halls, proper etiquette in regards to personal 
space is thrown out the window. 

It turns out that San Diego’s Haunted Hotel is a basement. 
Each room of the “hotel” is different and offers an array of 
expectedly unexpected terror. A blood-drenched vampire 
awaits you in an antique coffin. Flesh-eating zombies rumble 
around in cages. A possessed-looking little girl climbs the 
wall. A blood-thirsty maniac suddenly emerges from a dark 
corner, screaming gibberish and revving his chainsaw. For 
the light-hearted, it may be jarring at first, but for anyone 
over the age of 16, it’s hilariously lame.  

Don’t worry, the actors aren’t allowed to actually touch 
you — although walking through groups, growling, whis-
pering and laughing hysterically are all acceptable practices. 

Thrill-seekers are then forced into a tough dilemma: to 
speed-walk and ignore the ghouls or make the most of your 
hard-earned dollars, interacting and taking your time in 
every room? With the price of an inevitable parking ticket 
on Market Street looming, you’ll probably go for the former. 

The problems with the Haunted Hotel are mostly predict-
able. Haunted houses are inevitably cheesy and overpriced; 
you wouldn’t spend $17 for the Disney Haunted Mansion 
alone, would you? We all want the whole kingdom too. It’s 

just not worth the spine tingles otherwise. 
In this case, you’d probably get just as much of a fright re-

watching “The Shining” on AMC, and you wouldn’t have to 
stand in theme park-worthy lines. If you’re still on the path 
to avoiding that Halloween frat party, try pre-gaming and get 
a laugh out of this seasonal attraction instead. Fear may be 
nowhere to be found, but humor is worth a shot.

THOUGHT

UCSD alumnus Rishi Ghosh said. 
Not that it’s been easy goings for OEOJ . Members met 

with the administration once a month for 5 years, coor-
dinated events like Ben & Jerry’s ice cream give-aways on 
Library Walk to raise campus awareness and circulated a 
petition that amassed 1,000 signatures. Still, the students 
found it difficult to make any headway.

“There was a tremendous amount of bureaucracy,” 
OEOJ core member and UCSD alumnus Chris Westling 
said. “We spent a long time talking to the wrong people that 
weren’t making the decisions.” 

The difference between their cause and similar ones, 
Ghosh said, was the students’ persistence.

“We found ourselves dealing with a lot of skepticism 
from the administration,” he said. “The administration per-
ceived that we were concerned students, but I imagine they 
thought that we would eventually go away. We were very 
pragmatic in our tactic — we didn’t villanize the adminis-
tration. We realized that they have a lot of obstacles to deal 
with themselves.”

According to Ghosh, the turning point came during Fall 
Quarter 2008 when OEOJ sat down with Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox and convinced her of the environmental benefits 
of Fair Trade products. Having talked her around, discus-
sion of the fair trade policy picked up speed, though there 
were some moments of doubt. 

 “Our original goal was not compromised at all [in the 
policy], but that doesn’t mean that we didn’t have a lot of 
long conversations about compromising it,” Ghosh said. 
“There were a lot of really tough times where we weren’t 

making any progress.” 
Still, OEOJ’s efforts haven’t gone 

wasted. UCSD has joined the ranks 
of Fair Trade Certified universities, 
most of which are in the United 
Kingdom. To become fair trade certi-
fied by FairTrade USA, universities are 
required to have one fair trade prod-

uct at each vendor. In addition to making fair trade coffee, 
sugar and tea available at all campus vendors and dining 
halls, the university is hoping to expand into other prod-
ucts, like chocolate and ice cream within the next few years.  

Fair trade items can be identified by a small, mono-
chrome sticker, which features a figure laid atop a globe, 
carrying two jugs. Items on campus that are currently 
fair trade include, among others,  Ben & Jerry’s ice cream 
(select flavors) and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.

For the money-conscious college student, the price dif-
ference between fair trade products and other items on the 
market are pennies on the dollar — though the price gap 
increases based on the product in question.  According to 
Ghosh, while fair trade tea and coffee cost the same as the 
regular stuff, sugar tends to be two to four times more. As 
for products newer to the fair trade line, like produce, the 
cost difference is more substantial. 

 “Initially, the product has to be certified and there is a 
cost for that, which is built in,”  Westling said. “But what 
fair trade does as well is that it builds a more direct connec-
tion with the farmer, the roaster, producer and consumer. 
And in doing so, it takes out a lot of the middlemen, so that 
saves a lot of money. So more or less, fair trade coffee costs 
the same as not fair trade coffee.”

Jessica Wall, a UCSD alumnus and a former OEOJ 
member, said fair trade products are higher quality than  
the average.

“There has to be some recognition of the quality 

improvement,” Wall said. “Fair trade producers are held 
to higher standards, resulting in a superior product with a 
more ethical footprint.”

Besides food, the policy states that fair trade sig-
nage will be displayed prominently at all locations, and 
employees will receive special training about the benefits 
of fair trade to continue to promote fair trade products. 
Additionally, there are guidelines for a new Fair Trade 
Advisory Committee, tasked with ensuring the new policy 
is upheld and that the university submits an annual report 
to FairTrade USA. 

UCSD tailored its policy for rapid growth from the 
FairTrade UK model. However, with the UK chapter lead-
ing with over 120 certified universities and counting (the 
first in the world was Oxford Brookes, certified in 2003), 
there’s a lot of work to be done.

“We have the optional products available right now, and 
hopefully those can eventually become policy,” Westling 
said. “Fair trade wine just came out last year. There’s wine at 
Zanzibar at the Loft. That’s something we could do.”

Wall agreed with Westling, mentioning that fair trade 
still had kinks to work out.

“We can always do better with sustainability; everyone 
can,” Wall said, “It is a path, rather than an endpoint to be 
reached. While fair trade certification is far from perfect, it 
is a huge step up from the status quo.”

For Ghosh, it’s a question of both cost effectiveness and 
morality.

“This campus is of the students and for the students,” 
Ghosh said. “Then the businesses on campus should also 
be of the students and for the students.”

FOCUSÊ MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 2010Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 

The last thing UCSD alumnus Faraz 
Ellahie  — better known as comedian Feraz 
Ozel  — wanted to be doing after he fin-
ished school was working on odd jobs. It’s 
not that Ozel, who graduated with a B.A. 
in political science magna cum laude last 
year, had no other options —  his mother 
called him every time a new law school 
acceptance letter came in, and the bur-
geoning funny-man was accepted to study 
at Santa Clara, UC Davis and other top-
tier law schools. But Ozel decided to defer 
his ambitions as a lawyer and try his hand 
at becoming a comedian. 

“They’ve been more supportive than 
most people from our background would 
be,” Ozel jokes of his Pakistani family. “I 
thought they were going to disown me.”

For Ozel, the decision was an easy one: 
He’s been the class clown since his ele-
mentary school days. As the self-described 
“fat kid with a great rack,” Ozel said he 
used comedy to avoid being the butt of 
everyone else’s jokes. Instead, he became 
the funny fat kid, experience which came 
in handy when he performed a comedic 

musical skit on stage for the first time at 
age 15 to a Pakistani audience of over 600 
people.

“I turned the best jokes I had into a 
song all about Pakistani culture,” Ozel 
said. “It was all about how they feed you 
too much, how my mom turned me into 
a fat kid with all her curry and rice, why 
they always make you drink tea, how 
everything you say has to rhyme and a lot 
of inside jokes.”

A few years later at UCSD, Ozel 
entered a comedy competition hosted by 
his fraternity, Lambda Chi Alpha, and won 
a $100 gift card.

“It was another musical skit that I still 
use in my shows today, just amped up,” 
Ozel said. “It was about how my girlfriend 
gave me a guitar for Christmas. I still 
dumped her a week later, but I kept the 
guitar because she got to keep the herpes. 
It was only fair.”

Most of Ozel’s jokes are geared toward 
a more mature audience — his favorite is 
about the video game Halo and its morbid 
relationship to the Go Army ad campaign. 

Generally, his material ranges anywhere 
from marijuana use to taking a shit on a 
classroom floor. 

“I have this one joke where I needed to 
go to the restroom one time in a lecture 
hall at UCSD and the teacher was like 
‘Well, is it an emergency?’” Ozel said. “I 
was like, well, back when I was six years 
old and didn’t know anything I would be 
like ‘Yeah, this is an emergency’ but I’m 
older now, I know what an emergency is. 
9/11 is an emergency, Hurricane Katrina 
was an emergency — I’m just going to 
shit on your floor. It’s just a code brown, 
maybe a code orange.”

His jokes have garnered some interest-
ing responses from audience members — 
most of them inappropriate.

“And then this guy in the second row, 
[who had been] quiet the whole time, was 
like, ‘Man, I’ve done that shit,’” Ozel said. 
“And I was like, ‘What, you shit on the 
floor? You had a teacher who wouldn’t let 
you go to the bathroom?’ He was like, ‘I 
just needed to shit.’”

He isn’t all about shits and giggles 
— for Ozel, developing his craft is a top 
priority. Last year, the comic performed 
throughout Europe in countries like 
Slovenia, Austria and Romania, and was 
interviewed by a Hungarian magazine. 
Ozel hopes to follow in the footsteps of 
some his favorite comedians — David 
Chapelle, Louis CK, Greg Giraldo and 
Sebastian Meniscalco — and write more 
political jokes.

“I started picking up the science of 
jokes, like the analogy and misdirection,” 
Ozel said. “So, with misdirection, it’s 
when people say, ‘You’re Pakistani; does 
that mean you hate Jews?’ And I’d say, 
‘No, what kind of ignorance is that? That 
means my grandfather hates Jews.’” 
Since returning from Europe, Ozel has 

begun working with a group of local com-
ics (which has helped land him several 
gigs) and booking two to three gigs a week. 
His connections have also been essential 
to the success of the Loft Out Loud series. 
LOL is a string of comedy shows, featuring 
both local and celebrity comics, that Ozel 
hosts once a month at the Loft.

 “I bring the best comics in SD [togeth-
er] — the guys who headline shows at bars 
and clubs,” Ozel said. “I get guys from L.A. 
who are normally on TV to come down 
and headline. LOL really is one of the best 
shows you’ll see in the city, better than 
some of the clubs. It’s definitely the best 
show you’ll see if you’re under 21.”

Once LOL has made a name for 
itself, Ozel hopes to partner with Triton 
Television to broadcast LOL on TTV and 
turn it into more of a late-night comedy 
show.  

Eventually, Ozel hopes to be able to 
move beyond San Diego into the bigger 
comedy scenes, like in San Francisco or 
Los Angeles. Luckily, the start-up comic 
has already managed to beat some of the 
pre-show jitters that trip up most come-
dians.

“Any rituals? Yeah, I like to make sure 
I stretch — touch my toes, limber up, do a 
few push-ups.” he said, “No, I don’t fuck-
ing do any of that. I just like to look over 
the crowd for a second. When I first start-
ed up, I would lock myself in the bath-
room and go over everything a few times 
in the stall. But now, I’m so comfortable 
that I just wait for them to call my name. I 
just run up there and do it.”

Ozel will be performing at the Comedy 
Store in La Jolla on Oct. 28 and The Loft’s 
next LOL show on Nov. 9.

Einstein, the Moon and the Long Lost Soviet Rover - 
One of the greatest successes of the former Soviet space 
program was a lunar rover called Lunokhod 1—Russian 
for “moonwalker.”Landing on the moon on November 
17, 1970 with a laser reflector, it wandered around 
the moon’s surface for 11 months then mysteriously 
disappeared -- until last spring. On April 22, nearly 40 

years after Lunokhod 1 disappeared, a team headed 
by Tom Murphy found the reflector and pinpointed 
its distance from earth to within one centimeter. The 
discovery came as part of a long-term project Murphy 
heads to send pulses of laser light to the moon from a 
telescope in New Mexico. The purpose, which he will 
describe in his talk, is to look for deviations of Einstein’s 
theory of general relativity by measuring the shape of 
the lunar orbit to within the accuracy of one millimeter, 
or about the thickness of a paperclip.

UC San Diego Halloween Contest - Costume 
registration ends when the contest begins at 11:45. 
Zombies and ghosts wander aimlessly in graveyards 
during the dead of night and hauntingly mumble 
and sigh amongst themselves, 'Who has the intestinal 
fortitude to enter this most gruesome and grueling 
of contests - and at their own risk?' They're eternally 
horrified that UCSD humans have the audacity to 
drag their costumes over to the PC West Plaza. If not 
to win spookdracular prizes, then to bear witness to 
the heart-wrenching and post-mortem thrills. If that 
isn't enough to frighten you into joining the fun as a 
spectator or contestant, perhaps the list of categories 
and monstrously delectable prizes will whet your 
appetite. Er...ah...good luck? You'll need it! 11:45am /

WOMEN’S SOCCER — The women’s 
soccer team secured its seventh con-
secutive win on Friday as the No. 21 
Tritons took a 1-0 victory against Cal 
Poly Pomona.

Despite being outshot by the 
Broncos 14-7, the Tritons were able to 
secure the win with a lone goal from 
sophomore midfielder Alexa Enlow 
in the 57th minute. The win moved 
UCSD to 9-2-2 in CCAA play, and 
makes them unbeaten in the last 10 
matches.

In the first period, the Tritons were 
frustrated in possession by a well-con-
ditioned Bronco squad that record-
ed nine shots. The energized Bronco 
offense tested junior goalkeeper Kristin 
Armstrong, who was forced to make 
five saves within a 5 minute period 
early in the game. However, the Triton 

defense stayed strong and Armstrong 
picked up her ninth shutout of the 
season while recording a season-high 
eight saves.

“It was a pretty rough start to the 
game,” Armstrong said about her role 
in the shutout. “I just tried to do my 
best to keep the slate clean, because we 
know how hard it is to play catch-up 
the rest of the game.” 

The Tritons came into the second 
half invigorated and hungry for a goal. 
Within the first 15 minutes, UCSD 
connected on the offensive end to gath-
er the game winner. Forward Annette 
Ilg sent a cross into the goal box that 
found the head of Enlow, who then sent 
the ball into the far post, beating the 
Pomona goalkeeper. Enlow — a mid-
field substitute for fellow sophomore 
Jessica Wi — put the ball in the back 
of the net for the first time this season, 
while Ilg registered her fourth assist.  

“I was lucky enough to have the 

perfect ball sent to me from Annette 
[Ilg],” Enlow said. “It was seriously the 
biggest rush I have felt in a while.” 

Thanks in large part to the energy 
of the reserves, including Enlow, com-
ing off of the bench, the Tritons were 
able to maintain their 1-0 lead to secure 
the win.

“The second half was a lot better 
for us,” Enlow said. “It’s always hard 
playing the team away at their field, but 
good teams find a way to win.” 

As the race towards conference 
playoffs tightens up, the Tritons — cur-
rently in second place behind CSU Los 
Angeles — will need to continue their 
winning streak to secure a spot in the 
post season. The squad will look to 
pick up their eighth consecutive win on 
Sunday, Oct. 24, against Cal State San 
Bernardino.

Women’s Soccer Makes it Seven Straight

By Liam Rose

MEN’S SOCCER — The men’s soc-
cer team eight-match unbeaten streak 
finally came to halt on Friday, when 
the Tritons fell 2-1 to Cal Poly Pomona.

The Tritons had a poor start to 
the match, letting in a goal in just the 
10th minute. Pomona’s Tyler Reinhart 
put in a close range shot from Luis 
Gonzalez’s pass to give the Broncos an 
early 1-0 lead.

“We came out a little bit flat and 
the other team got off to a very good 
start,” head coach Jon Pascale said. 
“They put us under a lot of pressure 
early. With our success recently, we 
came in with a bit of a target on our 
back.”

The Tritons failed to create any 
good chances in the first half, and 
the score remained at 1-0 going into 
halftime.

“We were a little bit slow in the 
beginning and they came out playing 
really well,” Pascale said. “For some 
reason — and I’m not sure what that 
reason was — it took us 45 minutes to 
get into the game.” 

UCSD came alive in the second 
half, getting off 12 shots and main-
taining good possession. However, the 
Broncos caught a break early in the 
half when Gonzalez found himself 
clear of the defense, and the forward 
was able to finish past freshman keep-
er Josh Cohen to put the Broncos up 
2-0. 

“I thought we had a good second 
half, and their second goal was a little 
against the run of play,” Pascale said. 
“Pomona has some very good for-
wards, and they really made the most 
of their chances.”

Despite the offensive pressure, the 
Tritons could not find the back of the 
net until the 88th minute. Freshman 

defender Cory Wolfrom sent in a cross 
that found the head of senior captain 
Jared Kukura. Kukura’s header beat the 
keeper, giving the defender his third 
goal of the season, but the Tritons 
didn’t have enough time to muster a 
chance to find the equalizer.

The Tritons face another tough test 
on Sunday, when they will travel to 
face No. 6 Cal State San Bernardino.

“San Bernardino is obviously a 
very, very good team,” Pascale said. “If 
we can play as well as we did in that 
second half, we can beat them. That’s 
as good as we have played this season.”

The Tritons battled to a 1-1 draw 
with Cal State San Bernardino on Oct. 
1. The Coyotes currently sit atop the 
CCAA South Division standings with 
28 points, while the Tritons are in 
fourth place with 21 points.

“I’m excited that we were ahead of a team the 
whole game and finished them off,” Luyties said. 
“It was a three-set victory, and our first where 
we didn’t let the other team back in it at all, so 
I’m very happy about that.”

Brunsting had 11 kills, 18 assists and 10 digs, 
Condon had 10 digs and 14 assists and senior 
middle blocker Cara Simonsen had a season-
high 10 kills for the Tritons.

Simonsen said that the team is different 
from the one that suffered the five game skid 
earlier this season.

“The team as a whole is doing really well,” 
she said. “Our defense has picked up, we’re get-

ting good passes, and Katie [Condon] and Julia 
[Freidenberg] and all the hitters up front are 
doing great.”

Luyties echoed Simonsen’s assessment, but 
maintained that there is still work to do.

“I think they have gelled together in a lot of 
ways,” Luyties said. “Defensively, they are more 
aware of where one another are on the court. 
There have been a few miscommunications in 
every game, but we’re doing well in that area.” 

UCSD is now 12-7 overall and 9-6 in CCAA 
play. The Tritons have won five straight and are 
winners of seven of their last eight, but remain 
in a tie for third in the CCAA standings with 
seven matches to play.

“I feel we have to win all of our games in 
conference to have a chance of going to the 
tournament,” Luyties said.

The Tritons will travel to Hayward on 
Wednesday to face Cal State East Bay — another 
team UCSD lost to in five sets in the previous 
meeting between the squads.

“I haven’t even thought about East Bay yet, 
just because this weekend was so big for us,” 
Luyties said. “I’m going to start watching film 
of them tonight and we’ll prepare for them just 
like anybody else.”

goalie Andy Stevens. LMU received yet 
another ejection, and this time UCSD 
took advantage of the six on five with 
a score by sophomore utility Brian 
Donohoe. 

Another goal for LMU again put 
the Lions ahead by two goals, until 
UCSD freshman utility Josh Stiling 
found the net as the final seconds of 
the second quarter ticked off the clock. 

With the score at 4-3, the Tritons 
came back fighting for the second half 
of the game and converted a six on five. 
Donohoe got a clean shot to the back 
of the net to tie up the score at four 
apiece. But another ejection gave LMU 
an advantage, and the Lions scored 
quickly to pull ahead again. 

“They were getting cross passes 
from one side of the pool to the other 
and then shooting the ball, and so it’s 
really hard to get there in time and 
make it to the top to block the shot,” 
junior goalkeeper David Morton said. 
“They were really tough shots and they 
made some good shots.”

The fourth period opened with a 
5-4 lead for LMU. The play was rough 
throughout the game, and LMU’s 
Albert Samuels got yellow carded and 
then rolled with almost 2 minutes 
left on the clock. Despite numerous 
attempts on goal — including a ball 
that floated right on the line but did 
not cross over — UCSD could not 
score again, and LMU put away two 
more goals to seal the win. 

“It was a good, entertaining ball 
game — a hard-fought game,” Harper 
said. “It had a lot of edge and spice 
to it, and I won’t quite take my hat 
off to them, but I will tip my hat to 
them because they played well and 
they won.”

Despite the disappointment of los-
ing, the team remained respectful to 
LMU for a solid game. 

“We tried our best and I think 
we’ve got a lot to learn from this game,” 
senior defense Jakub Bednarek said. 
“The next time we play, we’re going 
to do a lot better. We’re going to keep 
working, and we’re going to come out 
and really play.” 

Up next for the Tritons is an away  
match at No. 2 UCLA on Oct. 30. 
The Tritons will then return home to 
Canyonview Pool on Nov. 2 to face 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps.

course in 25:51. Levy finished in third over-
all behind two unattached runners. Levy was 
followed by five more UCSD runners: junior 
Patrick French, freshman Mario Flores, junior 
Alex Corliss, freshman Ben Rich and freshman 
Ryan Lok. 

Although Chico State appears to have the 
conference title locked up, the race for second is 
wide open with the Tritons right in the thick of it.

“After running [Pomona] pretty close 
here, I think it will be a really fun meet in two 
weeks,” Garcia said. “I think with [Pomona] and 
Humboldt State — who [Pomona] tied earlier the 
year — the three of us should be neck and neck 
at conference. So I’m excited where our guys are.”

The women’s team was led by freshman 
Kamilah Foley, who clocked 22:55 over the 6k 
course to take sixth place. Junior Aaryn Kobayashi 
and sophomores Jackie Sikkema, Heather Hisgen 
and Katie Kane rounded out the Triton scorers.

The women’s team ran close to Cal State 
Stanislaus, and the conference meet promises to 
be just as competitive.

“We were only one point behind Stanislaus, 
which was a lot of fun,” Garcia said. “It came right 
down to the end, and I know our gals are hungry 
to get back out there and get another shot at them 
in two weeks.”

The Tritons will return to the Legg Lake 
course on Nov. 6 for the CCAA Championships.

Tritons Head Into Final Stretch With Wins
WOMENS VOLLEYBALL

 Entering the �nal three weeks of the season, the Tritons start their push for the playoffs with a weekend sweep.

The womens volleyball team recorded its fourth and 
fifth consecutive victories over the weekend, including what 
was perhaps the squads most comfortable win of the season. 

The Tritons rallied to beat San Francisco State on Friday, 
overcoming a rough first set to win 19-25, 25-22, 25-9 and 
25-19. UCSD was then dominant against Cal State Monterey 
Bay on Saturday, sweeping the Otters with scores of 25-15, 
25-14 and 25-17.

Were definitely on the rise, head coach Ricci Luyties 
said. Coming back from the injuries that we had, I knew 
wed get better, and I think [the players] are starting to 
believe that too. I think we are a team to be reckoned with 
now.

Junior outside hitter Katie Condon and junior Roxy 
Brunsting led the way against San Francisco State, when 
Condon had a match-high 16 kills and Brunsting recorded 
her third consecutive triple double with 10 kills, 26 assists 
and 14 digs. The Tritons hit just .093 in the first set, but 
rebounded to hit .298 for the match  their second highest 

mark this season.
Saturdays match against Monterey Bay marked the 

beginning of a stretch in which the Tritons once again play 
the opponents they lost to during their five-game losing 
streak earlier in the year. Luyties said he was confident his 
team is ready to avenge the programs longest losing streak 
since 1992.

We had that five-game stretch where we lost to all these 
teams, and it was so bitter for us because they were all so 
close, Luyties said. Were excited about playing them again 
and we want to get revenge on them. We know we have to 
win all of them, and I think were coming out ready for it.

The Tritons proved Luyties right in the match against 
Cal State Monterey Bay, whom UCSD lost to in five sets on 
Sept. 17. This time, however, the Otters were thoroughly 
humbled, as the Tritons hit .347 on the match and saw 
Brunsting record her fourth straight triple double.

Staff Writer 

The mens water polo team played 
a fierce, physical game with Loyola 
Marymount University on Saturday, 
but an excellent defensive display was 
not enough to overcome offensive dif-
ficulties and the Tritons fell, 7-4.

The last time we did beat [Loyola 
Marymount] we gave up seven goals 
but our offense was dysfunctional 
today, head coach Denny Harper said. 
I dont really have any answers as to 
why we shot the ball so poorly. Theyre 
a really good defensive teambut to 
be fair, we just did not shoot the ball 
well at all.

The game got off to a competitive 
start, with an ejection for each team 
within the first minute of play. The 
Lions got the first six-on-five advan-

tage and used those 20 seconds to 
score a goal on junior goalie David 
Morton in the upper right corner. The 
Tritons gained the advantage and an 
offensive turnover, but their shot went 
high and sailed over the cross bar.  

LMU scored another goal, but the 
Tritons recovered and sophomore util-
ity John Butler tossed in a clear shot 
past the goalie to bring the score to 2-1. 

The second period started with 
another ejection in favor of UCSD, but 
the Tritons were unable to convert and 
a six-on-five in favor of LMU swiftly 
nullified the advantage. The Lions 
Albert Samuels sent in a shot that was 
tipped into the goal by Ikaika Aki to 
send the score to 3-1. 

Butler made another attempt on 
goal, but was stopped by the Lions

The UCSD cross country teams 
traveled to Whittier, Calif. over the 
weekend to compete on the course that 
will hold the CCAA Championships 
in two weeks time. The course seemed 
to suit them well, as the Tritons came 
away with first and second place fin-
ishes at the Bronco Preview Meet on 
Saturday.

The mens side had six of the top 
eight finishers, winning the meet with 
a perfect 15 points, while the Triton 
women had five runners in the top 15 
to take second overall.

The meet was held at Legg Lake 
in Whittier Narrows Regional Park, 
which is the home course of Cal Poly 
Pomona. The Triton men narrowly 
lost to the Broncos two weeks ago at 
the Triton Classic, but were denied 
another shot at Pomona as the Broncos 
fielded only three runners in the race. 
However, this allowed the Tritons to 
rest some of their athletes, and head 
coach Nate Garcia was pleased with 
the results.

It was a very good meet, Garcia 
said. The guys we had running this 
week really stepped up. We had an 
opportunity to rest some guys this 
week and still perform well. Winning 
the meet and finishing with 15 points 
was a really nice accomplishment for 
us, and we got some guys to step up for 
us in ways they hadnt yet.

Freshman Kellen Levy led the way 
on the mens side, finishing the 8k
