Tutu, Jackson and Chiefs of Staff highlight the year 

Controversy, construction characterize 85-86 
By CHERYl.. CARIWRIGHT, Staff Write r 

The past academic year has 
seen an impressive 25th birthday 
celebration of prestigious 
academic awards, numerous 
hefty grants and extensive 
expansion and construction at 
UCSD. The statistics look 
impressive for the infant 
university - in the tOP 10 
percent of undergraduates who 
go on to earn PhD's and first in 
the nation in the perc~ntage of 
students eaming doctoral degrees 
in the life sciences. 

stop busses 30, 34 and 301 at 
the corner of La Jolla Shores 
Drive and Torrey Pines Road 
hoping to apprehend illegal 
aliens. Some UCSD students are 
stopped and asked to show 
proof of their citizenship. 

But the year has also been one 
of continued political conflict 
between students and 
administrators , funding 
controversy between the 
Associated Students and the 
alternative media, and discord 
because of the new alcohol 
policy. Protests against the 
university'S lack of divestment 
from companies in South Africa 
nd civil disobedience over the 
university's complicity with the 
military, CIA and INS 
(Immigration and Naturalization 
Service) continue to escalate.

In the fall , a 39-year-old 
female UCSD staff member was 
raped at US in the afternoon 
while she jogged through the par 
course , north of Central Library.

was arrestcd after throwing red 
paint on the table of military

recruits on Revelle Plaza. 
Although UC student vOled for 

divestment of stocks from 
companies doing business in 
South Africa, the UC Regents 
instead decided that the 
university would create UAClR (a 
nine member committee of 
faculty, staff, student and alumni) 
to discuss possible solutions to 
divestment. UC President David 
Gardner said that the university 
would not invest in companies 
which are not "actively opposing 
apartheid," but this statement 
was "nOt a policy of divestment." 

Student prot~sts 
In response , the I<S Council 

and the Graduate Students 
Association voted to support an 
all-day campus strike to 
commemorate Intemational Day 
for Solidarity with Political 
Prisoners and National Anti-
Apartheid Day. 

In early October, twO students 
and members of the Coalition for 
a Free South Africa, Sadhana 
Bery and Russell Andalcio, were 
handcuffed and detained at the 
UCSD police station for one 
hour for "interfering wim a 
(police officer)" and because 
"they just would not get out of 
John 's (Anderson's) face," 
according to police Lt. Jay 
Dwyer. 

Before "Twenty-five Years of 
the presidency" was held at 
UCSD in Januaty , never before 
had eight chiefs of staff of the 
United States convened. The 
impressive line-up of chiefs of 
staff from Presidents Eisenhower 
through Carter included Sherman 
Adams from the Eisenhower 
Administration, Alexander Haig 
and H.R Haldeman from the 
Nixon Administration, Donald 
Rumsfeld and Richard Cheney 
from the Ford Administration 
and Hamilton Jordan from the 
Carter Administration. 

At Revelle Plaza and Mandell 
Weiss Theatre , students 
protested the meeting of the 
chiefs of staff with a "Rally for 
People's History" and speeches 
to "Oppose Disinformation." 

South African Bishop of 
Johannesburg, Desmond Tutu, 
winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace 
Prize , spoke on Thursday, 
January 23 to a gym full of UCSD 
students. "Those who invest in 
South Africa ought to know quite 
dearly, whemer they like it or 
not , that they are supporting one 
of the most vicious systems the 
world has ever known," he said . 

After Tutu's address, several 
students anacked evangelist 
BrotherJed and his pro-South 
Africa sign . In the commotion,

Russell Andalcio, a student 
member of the Coalition for a 
Free South Africa, was later 
accused of "lynching, prompting 
others to assault university police 
officers, threats of violence or 
conduct that threatens the health 
or safety of any person on 
university propeny .. . ." according 
to the police report. 

The charges against Andalcio 
were eventuaUy dropped , 
although Professor Peter Irons, 
adviser to the student movement, 
instigated an Academic Senate 
investigation into me univerSity'S 
handling of the incident. 

In February, Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 
students and representatives 
from the Black Students' Union, 
the Asian-Pacific Students 
Alliance, MEChA, and the 
Women's Resource Center raUied 
to "address economic, racial and 
gender-based discrimination 
within the university" and to 
"encourage unity between me 
minority factions on campus." 
Dennard Clandenin, BSU 
representative , assened me SMC 
students to "find unity in a 
collective effort and no longer 
suffer manipulation by the 
administration ." 

Crowd at Jesse Jacllson raUy 

1)1 March; a group of 30 
students from California visited 
Nicaragua to acquire information 
thrQugh me project, Protocol for 
Peace. Meetings wim Nicaraguan 
officials were coordinated by the 
U.S. State Department. After the 
trip, a Peace Conference was 
held to produce a Declaration of 
Negotiations with the goal of 
illustrating that "students do have 
an impact when working 
together, that peace needs to be 
defined and that conflicts can be 
resolved through negotiations," 
according to conference officials. 

A crowd of 50 to 100 people 
protested Nicaragua contra leader 
Arturo Cruz when he spoke at 
UCSD's Institute of the Americas. 
Cruz is one of three leaders of 
the United Nicaraguan 
Opposition (UNO). 

Three thousand UCSD 

students attended a rally .for 
student involvement on Revelle 
Plaza when the Reverend Jesse 
Jackson spoke in April and 
encouraged students to get 
inolved, register to vote and 
"choose another course" of 
action . "We must live together as 
brothers and sisters, not die 
apart as fools . We must tell the 
desperate , 'Do not choose 
Rambo, choose Rainbow (the 
Rainbow Coalition).'" he said . 

Due to charges of election 
mismanagement conceming me 
thousands of students 
disenfranchised when the 
Central Cashier's office was 
delinquent in processing 
registration fees and the last-
minute distribution of misleading 
campaign materials, both the I<S 
elections and run-off elections 
were postponed in late April, 
costing the AS an additional 
$4,000. 

Following a rally on April 24 
in protest of U.S. foreign policy 
in Central America, South Africa 
and Libya, more man 30 
students occupied me Career 
.Services Center demanding an 
end to the use of UC student 
fees for military recruitment 
purposes, including that of the 
FBI, CIA and INS. 

By spring quaner, students 
had constructed shanties on 
Revelle Plaza or "Biko Plaza" as a 
symbolic protest against South 
Africa. UCSD police tore down 
the shanties Citing an invalid 
permit for the shanty 
construction. Another permit was 
negotiated, and the shanties will 
remain until June 15. 

Policy conflicts 
In September, despite 

recommendation by the Alcohol 
and Substance Abuse Committee, 
Dr. Joseph Watson , vice 
chancellor of undergraduate 
affairs , instituted a residence 
halls' alcohol policy which 
limited the acquisition of alcohol 
to students under 21 , restricted 
consumption of alcohol in "semi-
private" space and banned kegs 
because they encourage 
"excessive consumption" of 
alcohol. Resident Dean of 
Warren College Mary Ruth 
Wamer said that the kegs are · 
not allowed because they 
"produce an unconstructive 
attitude." 

"This rule gives us a way to 
control flagrant irresponsible use 
(of alcohol)," Dr Richard 
Whitehill, head of UCSD's 
Psychological Services said . 
"Clearly there are going to be 
some students who are going to

was inconsistent and 
unenforeeable . "We need a

In fall quaner, AS 
Communications Commissioner 
Michael Fahlbusc h introduced an

Fahlbusch said . "I'm trying to be

LUHHS LUHHSLuHHS LUHHS L 
Shantytown revisited 
Editor: 

1 am writing with {WO related 
purposes. The first is to urge all 
graduating students and faculty 
participants in UCSD 
commencement exercises to wear 
white armbands on their robes. 
to protest South African 
Apartheid and to demand that 
the UC Regents implement a full 
divestment policy. 

Both the students and faculty 
on this campus have voted to 
support the divestment demand. 
which would be a step of both 
real and symbolic importance in 
cutting UC ties with the 
abhorrent system of racial 
apartheid . The wearing of white 
armbands. as part of a national 
graduation protest. will manifest 
our positions on this crucial 
issue . 

My second point is that your 
June 2 article on the StatuS of the 
Revelle Plaza shantytown was 
superficial and presented only 
the administration 's voices. Your 
story neglected to report that 
issuance of a third permit for the 
shanties came only after 
intensive negotiations with Dean 
Ernie Morc of Revelle College. 
and despite virtual intransigence 
on the part of Vice-Chancellor 

Joe Watson. 
1 was asked to conduct these 

negotiations as faculty advisor to 
the Ann-War Action Committee. 
the student group that erected 
the shanties. Dean Mort and I 
had both Signed a valid permit 
that extended through June 15. 
but it was supposedly "lost" by 
the University Events office and 
was not "found " until AWAC 
members threatened to bring suit 
against the UniverSity. Although 
a second permit had an 
expiration date of May 22 . the 
first permit. in fact. committed 
the UniverSity to allow the 
shantytown to exist through the 
end of the quarter. 

Your article quoted Dr. Watson 
as saying the shanties were 
removed (at 6:00 am at the 
beginning of a th.ree-day 
weekend) because they were 
allegedly -in violation of size and 
noise regulations" and because of 
unspecified complaints from on-
campus residents. There are no 
such regulations and the permits 
included none. The shanty 
residents had been bombarded 
with dangerous missiles from 
nearby dorms and the 
administration took no action to 
halt these attacks. The shanties 
were removed. in facl. by fiat of

JUSt for a second, the {WO biggest 
events on campus, and the most 
memorable, are the remarkable 
speeches given by the Reverend 

Jesse Jackson and South African 
Bishop Desmond Tutu. Their 
messages of courage and 
freedom, of never letting us forget 
the struggle of those in our own 
country and around the world, 
are what a university education is 
all about. 

I hope that someday the 
students. faculty and staff will 
wake up and realize what an 
opportunity they have to learn 
and change the world they live in . 
Let's not settle for healthy jobs 
building bombs, let's find a way to 
be rid of them forever. ~

Dr. Watson . 
My negotiations with Dean 

Mort were both protracted and 
productive, with compromises on 
both sides as we hammered out 
the "time, place and manner" 
details of a new permit. I asked 
for a meeting with Dr. Watson 
and organized an ad hoc faculty 
committee to impress on him 
our concern with his antagonism 
to the shanties and his veto 
power over any permit. He 
finally agreed to give Dean Mort 

the power to conclude an 
agreement, but nor, in my 
opinion. because he wanted to 
see the shanties on this campus. 

It is distress ing that the 
administration has reacted with 
such obstructionism and 
"midnight rclid" tactics to this 
visible symbol of opposition to 
apanheid. The shanties may be 
ugly. but apanheid is infinitely 
uglier.

Editor: 

We are writing this letter in 
order to clear up a point of 
confusion over who is 
responSible for the current efforts 
to expose both the A.S. and the 
UCSD administration's 
complicity in sham elections 
which have disenfranchised 
literally thousands of students. 

Both your paper and the A.S. 
have given the credit for these 
efforts to the new indicator

would like to point out that this 
is patently false and must be 
corrected. The organization that 
should be receiving the credit for 
this important work is the 
Organizing Support Group of the 
Student Cooperative Union 
(OSG-SCU). 

While it is true that there are 
members of the OSG-SCU who 
are also new indicator collective 
members, the collective as a 
whole has never decided to 
panicipate in . or to endorse. the 
OSG-SCU's activities. The OSG-
SCU has never asked us to do 

so. In addition, while the new 
indicator collective does endorse 
the OSG-SCU's asse.nion that the 
present AS. is an illegitimate 
body. and is only an advisory 
committee to the chancellor, we 
do not necessarily endorse all of 
the OSG-SCU 's actions. 

The new indicator is a multi-
tendency forum of progressive 
news and views, and members of 
the staff belong to a wide variety 
of other organizations-groups 
which often have differing views.

A big advantage in Coed Softball is the team 
with the "Big Claw" women at first base. h 
allows you to put all your macho males in their 
favorite positiOns. No bruised egos can equal a 
championship team. HiUary fills this capacity 
well, She can scoop it with the beSt or them. The 
Garv would be envious.

RBIs: 35 

The Budman has one quality he looks for in 
an all-star second baseman, the ability to rum 
the deuce. This year's all-star second baseman 
can do it with the best of them. What we didn't 
figure was a second baseman who could hit. 
Most second basemen couldn't hit water ir they 
rell in it. But Jimmy makes a big splash 
whenever he goes to the plate. 

Third Base - Htlmut Dorausch 
Team: As You Were 
Batting Average: .700 
Home Runs: 20 
RBis: 80 

Everyone's favorite MSO, Helmut not only 
panrols campus with vigor, but patrols the hot 
comer like Brooks Robinson. Most MSOs don't 
carty guns. That is, most MSOs excluding 
Helmut. This guy carries a gun wherever he 
goes, it's called his right arm. At the plate he 
drives the ball with the power of a Boris Becker 
setVe. Rumor has it that he has already Signed a 
big bonus contract to take Graig Nettles' third 
base spot on the Padres. The rumor must be true 
if you'vI! seen him driving his hot red Mercedes 
around campus lately. 

Shortstop - Kt:vin Naltamum 
Team: Bo hica 
Batting Average: .400 
Home Runs: 2 
RBis: 25 

UCSD is a titde weak at shortstop this year. 
We rcally had to beat the bushes to find a talent 
wOlthy of yours truly. We finally found him 
playing shortstop on Unda Lovelace's favorite 
team, the BOHlCA gagger~. Kevin must have 
patterned himself after Garry Templeton of the 
Padres. Not much or a bat, not much hustle, but 
when the ball is hit his way you can bet he will 
make the play. 

Left Field - Dr. Tom Bannan 
Team: Take No Prisoners 
Batting Average: .725 
Home Runs: 20 
RBIs: 85 

To be the all-star left fi elder you must have a 
Dr. in front of your name. Tom does and so do 
the two previous all-star left fielders. Tom 
desetVes this honor as he won the triple crown 
this year leading the IMs in batting average, 
home runs and RBIs. Tom' been preaching 
how good he is for eight years now. You see, 
Tom's his own beSt fan . Tom will not repeat 
next year. He I done at Med School and will be 
Joining the world of medicine. Watch out 
though, if you arc referred to Dr. furman , 
remember he also led 1M in errors, Bad hands 
you know. 

Center Field - Chris Stavros 
Team: Juan Harry Boosh 
Batting Averelge: ,620 
Home Runs: 15 
RBIs: 42 

This rormer UCSD baseballer, better known 
as "chicken hawk. " showed us all how 
centerfield is supposed to be played. Speed is 
his game and he has as much as The 
Roadrunner, Any ball hit 10 the outfield he will 
run down. He plays so close that his team 
sometimes uses him as a second baseman and 
the centerfielder at the same time. 

Right Field - Shawn Stingfcy 
Team: Mongerel Bitch 
Batting Average: .560 
Home Runs: 4 
RBIs: 28 

Shawn Stingley, the pride of South lake 
Tahoe, is our all-star rightfielder. It's a natural 
that Shawn make the team since he learned 
from the master, Hubba Jubba himself, the 
legendary Bob Moss. Bob teaches all the P.E. 
sortball classes and is a master or the game. 
Shawn learned his lessons well as he reminds 
one or the ramous Robeno Clemente. A great 
arm. great bat and total humility. Eat your heart 
out, Wal~ 

Catcher - Kim Whitmore 
Team: Foreplayer For Girls 
Batting Average: .744 
Home Runs: 10 
RBis: 44 

Catcher is not one or the glory positions. In 
ract, in coed, a lot or teams don't need a catcher 
because of all the chauvinistic ball hogging 
males who WOn't let the females take the throw. 
In Kim's case . no male on her tcam would even 
think of taking a throwaway from her. If they 
did, they know they would be in order for a 
deserving quick kick in the ying-yangs. She 
does the ladies proud, I wish more of you would 
take this attitude. 

Pitcher - Lortn Albcrtaui 
Team: DSP 
Wins 8 Losses 0 
ERA: 0.95 

The most important position in 1Ms is the 
pitcher. A good pitcher can make a mediocre 
team great. This is the case with DSP (Delta 
Sigma Phi for all you GDls). DSP is a bunch of 
great guys and they wear hot uniforms, but 
these dudes would be nowhere without this 
year's Cy Young winner, Loren. He throws the 
ball so high it almost brings rain. Another thing 
the BOOman likes about Loren is the fact that he 
can make all those who go to the plate looking 
for a walk swing the bat. Why even take a bat to 
the plate ir you're looking for a walk? In fact , 
against Loren, why take a bat at all? You 
probably won't get a hit anyway. 

Manager of the Year - Fran!! "Slrippa 
fittgmdd 
Team: Strong Up the Middle 

This goes to the one 1M athletc who may not 
be able to win games with his bat or his glove, 
but who C'an steal a game with his brilliant 
strategies and ingenious moves. What better 
person ror this award than somebody already 
nicknamed "Skipper: Skipper may not have 
the most talented squad , and he doesn't, but his 
tcam always does well . That has to be attributed 
to his leadership. He gets the beSt team money 
can buy, A George Steinbrenner he's nOl, but a 
couple of Six-packs can get some great 1M 
ballplayers. Using the Skips computer-like 
brain, his team finished second in their league 
and lost their first round or the playoffs. 
Without the Skip this team of nerds probably 
would never have won a g,une. Get some tillem 
next year, will ya kip?

Budman's Empty Beer Can Awards 

It 's the end of the year and its time to recap all the ups and downs of another big year in 
Intramurals. Read 'em and weep! You all earned them. 

The Coveted 1M Cot.-\_d .... This award is presented yearly to the person who spends the 
most time in the intramural office. ThiS year's recipient is Roben Carden IV from the Geeks 
From EECS. Roben spent so much time down at the 1M office that the staff thought he worked 
there. 
Old M4I" of the YftP'A_rd .... This year it goes toone Todd Nonon. Todd already has a leg up 
on every old maid by being a walking catalog of Soap Opera trivia. He is the originial coach 
potato. 
Older MAIn of lhe YftP'A_d .... Andrew Keeler is actually the original "Old Man" of UCSD. 
Working on his second decade of schooling at UCSD. Andrew is an institution at the big "U'" 
Rumor has it he might be graduating this Spring. 
0ItJeit Man of lhe Yr. Award... . Sorry Todd and Andrew, but the Oldest Man or the Year 
Award goes to the oldest acting 1M athlete, Ross Kay. One of the best athletes on campus when 
he was younger, Ross JUSt seems to get older and older by the minute, Bones and muscles 
become susceptible to injury the older you get. Just look at Ross. 
Best 1M FrCltmtityOn Ca'"l""Award .... Phi Delta Theta without a doubt I With a tough win in 
the lFC soccer tournament, and a questionable win in the IFC softball tournament (who paid 
him?) there's no doubt who won this award. Look for the Phi Dehs to get better and better. and 
the perenially strong TKEs to become a nonentity. U., M4In oflhe YftP'.... Hands down Todd Jacobson wins this award. He's sooooo ugly that 
(make up your own joke. Whatever it is will be appropriate). 
Worst Division in Intnlmurlll Sports. ... Volleyball players are historically known as airheads. 
The Men's AM Volleyball division certainly proved that to be true. This past fall they thought it 
would be all right to interchange teams whenever they wanted. Nobody will care, right? Wrong! 
All teams were declared illegal because or ineligible players and for the first time ever no 
championship was held in a spon, I guess all volleyball players are as clueless as campus 
voUeyball guru Doug Dannevik. 
Pop-Off of 1M Yeer Award .. . .This goes to frisbee addictJeffWinkel. "Nooooooobody will beat 
us this year," so saidJeTf at the beginning of the Spring Ultimate season. Well.]efT is enJoying a 
large Nike in the mouth after his team's loss to Cardiac Arrest in the Ultimate Disc finals. 
&a CaB In IMs 1986.... I'm sure evetyone has their own ravorite. But mine was made by CIF 
and intramural umpire Tony Mello, He was umpiring agame in which 1M DirectorScOlt Bemdes 
was playing in . He also knew that anyone on Bemdes team who struck out was fined a Six-pack 
or Bud. Tony proceeded to call a phantom third strike on Scott, thus causing a fine . Ha, ha , ha, 
hal 
Best 1M AtItku oflhtYtarAward- Mcdt.... I'm sure his ego doesn't need this but doggone it, 
he earned it. Randy Bennet is our male 1M athlete of the year. He won and set a new record in the 
intramural Superstars COntest. The field was loaded with talent but Randy won easily. 
Best 1M Atlaleu of tilt: Ymr Award - FmllK.... Probably deserves best 1M athlete of the year, 
Karen Prather. Karen won the IntramlJral Superstars Contest setting a record, won the women's 
Floor Hockey championship, won the coed Aoor Hockey championship, won the coed 
Innenube Waterpolo championship, is also on the #1 rated women's softball team and is an 
awrully nice gal to boot. 
RaId", Hills Gradu/JUS oflhe Ytm' A_d.... Two of the best athletes at UCSD used to be two 
or the biggest consumers of alcoholic beverages, Mike Mitchell and Mike Dabosinskas (Dabo). 
These are some large people who could consume large amounts of fire water, It could be 
dangerous being around these dudes when under the influence. Mike was seen trying to knock 
down the Rec Gym one time (I wish he had) and [}dbo was seen carrying a BMW down 17th 
Street in Del Mar. But thank God, now you can't pay them to take a drink.1t's amazing, but the 
world and UCSD is a sarer place than ks to Raleigh Hills. 
Besl Units In Iltt: IUs A_rd.... The 1M sortball learn named after one of our great leaders, 
Moammar Khadafi. The Khadafi Hit Squad could be mistaken for the US Marines on a mission. 
They come to each game dressed in combat fatigues complete with amounage on their races. 
Haircuts were also parr of theirunies. Each had a razor CUI. Heck, these gus won half their games 
on inllimidation. The other team was afraid to beal them for fear of their lives. 
Sh~1 Elbows in IMs A_rd.. Paul Rasmussen's elbows are so sharp he could cut a hole in 
a piece of glass. JUSt ask any AAA basketball player or hockey player. 
Best Individu4ll Unit A_d .. .. Jennife'f'lCollins, 1M player and ref, used nashy outfits to 
distract the competition. Talk about wanting to win. One day she wore a polka-dotted outfit that 
everyone is still talking about. he won the gamc, though. What a way to win. I love it.

T Niki Newland.1i he courtyard shared by the 
Guardiall and the Che Cafe has a lot 
of memones for me. LIst Se ptember, 
Phil Willon and Andrew Keeler 
Interviewed me lor the production 
worker position. We sat around a 
rickety' old pI ni wble and I can 
remember Phil telling me, "The 
people who work at the GuardlQ ll arc 
very dedicated to their work. Often. 
the editors attend UCSD JUSt so that 
they can work at the Guardla~I . " 

Winter quaner, the Associate 
News Editor position was open and I 
applied. After a gruelling Interview 
dunng which my friends became 
serious colleagues, I made It ! I was the 
Associate News Editor for the 
Guardian and I was 0 proud. 

Two shon weeks later, the News 
Editor left for Taiwan and I changed 
desks. It took me weeks to pick up 
where she left ofT and a month before 
I could actually see the top of my 
new desk. 

Throughout this quarter. I greeted 
my friends' proposals that I run for 
editor with a · Yeah. nght ., .. Sure I'll 
run for editor in chien" in very 
sarcastic tones. 

Gradually. though, the idea 
became plausible , then a definite 
possibility and final ly reality. 

Before I make my way up to the' Bay 
Area this summer, I think I'd like to go 
outSide and sit In the counyard for a 
while. The Guardiall has become my 

I Suzanne Lif.~on t'S imponant to enjoy a few little 
pleasures in life - a wedge of aged 
brie, warm french bread. a bottle or 
two of German Reisling or if you 
must , some Ferrara Almond de Luz, 
and the pleasant odor of musky 
jasmine everywhere. Simple, isn't it? 

"Let's have fun !" is my war cry,and 
some of the battles have been a blast 
at UCSD. I WdS fresh off Wrigley Field 
when I landed in Muir College, and 
adjusting to the new So-Cal culture as 
well as college life was trying Luckily, 
my "sllll -to-this-Jay-and-always" 
buds from the donn kept the laughter

admit that several times in the last 30 
weeks my seholastic motivatton 
stemmed from my desire to work at 
the Guardian, ridiculous as that 
state ment is. 

It would be nice to Sit back and 
think without the pressure of 
deadlines. To think of tlte fun , yet 
rather strange time we shared. I can 't 
believe that some of the people I gOl 
to know so well at 2 am arc "outta

A Phil Willon nd so It went on through the 
night ; the quiet sc reams of 
desperation, the cheap red Wine and 
the buzz of a fly that JUSt would n't 
quit. When the door finally slammed 
shut I rca hed for my last Lucky 
Strike. my only comfort in thiS God-
forsaken hell-hole they called Los 
Angeles. It was ·getting old, and that 
face in the mirror was looking like the 
receiving end of one of Harry's 
Friday night beer brawls. I had to get 
out or I would have been dead before 
I turned 18. 

So I moved down San Diego way. 
found myself a house on the beach 
and staned writing about surfers. 
Yeah. that 's it. Surfers. Then one day I 
stumbled across some shack in the 
woods, next 10 this greasy spoon 
called the ChI' Caf~ . It W.lS a

newspaper. I decided to look into it. 

When I stuck my foOl In the door I 
could almost smell the stench of the

pouring onto the newspage like

o nee '::n~m::::as a 
little girl with blonde hair and an 
idealistic vision of the future who 
liked 10 tell stories. In fact , this little 
girl laked to tell her tales 10 so many 
peoplc lo far away places that she 
had 10 find a job in order to pay the 
big, bad men at AT&T. (She was quitc 
a chatterbox. that little gIrl was.) So 
she got all dressed up and took a 
journey. And finally she faced the 
gray, loomang Ca reer Center 
monster. 

She picked up her referral and ran 
to apply. A few days later, she got the 
job and was ecstatic. She did not 
know then , however, what kind of 
.Iddiction she was about to contract. 
By the cnd of fall quarter, her 
scheduled l4 hours a week of 
typesetting became 20. and she was 
writing news stories for the paper as 
well. 

After Chnstmas she came back 
and still could not get enough. The 
once mild· mannered typesetter and 
writer aspired to still greater heights. 
She took on more news aSSignments 
and learned more about the 
fundamentals of journalism. Then, 
her big break came. Old iVUC was 
thanking about retiring, and he 
thought he might give the little girl a 
chance and let her write some 
opinions pieces. 

She made a lot of enemies. 
Some of them called her up, and 

some of them wrote her letters. But 
she was still happy. because at least 
those people had staned thinking 
and acting rather than Just sitting 
back and lemng their lives wasl! over 
them. And she learned a lot about 
herscl r. 100. 

The people that site talked to and 
the friends that she made at the 
GuardlQn encouraged her to think 
and change and take risks that she 
wouldn't have had the courage to 
take before. And shc-loved them all, 
and she thanked them for being 
intelligent, ethi a! people, and for 
helping her become one , too. And 
they lived happily ever after. rn

All th is led me to that 
dilapidated , mouse-infested 
shack we caU home - the

tutelage of one Wolfgang Johann 
Schacht - I tried honing my 
skills to become the next Jim

But alas, it was aU for naught. 
Alth ough Yin Sc ully had Red 
Barber, and Red Smith had 
Grantland Rice , my respect for 
my mentor was somewhat 
suspect, as he was a Padres 
afficionado. 
There were other major chinks 

in the armor: the chain-smoking, 
the lewd ogling of female 
colleagues, and the c rude, ye t 
acerbic wit. And altho ugh he 
discovered his own version of "Dr.

exterior would shine through . 

Now don 't quit reading 
becausc you think this is some 
drippy soliloquy about fading 
mem ories as "Pomp and

Being low man on the totem pole is something Pat Weishan 
relishes; in fac he thrives on it. Pat, a junior Management Science 
major, is the Triton's top golfer and in the golfing world, low is the 
name of the game. 

How low can he go? Pat, two year NCAA Division 1Il All, 
American, was the Triton's low man this season in 12 of 19 
matches. He placed first in the Southern California Intercollegiate 
Tournament with a 148 for 36 holes and a low round of 69. 

This season Pat has been a medalist in nine matches and has 
posted a 76.0 round average in 19 matches. Most recently Pat 
participated in the NCAA Division II Golf Championship and for 
the second consecutive year reigns as the National Runner'up, 
losing by just one stroke. 

For his consistent play and his recent sterling performance at 
the Nationals, UCSD Athletics is very pleased to name Pat 
Weishan as May's Bud light Athlete~f,the·Month.

After much deliberation and incredible rumors 
(everyone short of Bruce Springsteen was at some point 
slated to play the TG), Wire Train has been "tentatively 
confirmed" for tomorrow's TGIO. University Events' 
Frank Yahr said late Wednesday afternoon, "Nothing has 
been signed yet or anything, but whatever we do have will 
be something good. II 

X was scheduled to perform, but was cancelled Monday 
due to demands of the movie being made with band 
member Xene Cervenka. No contract was signed because, 
according to AS Programmer Joel Schachne, "It takes too 
long. It's too much of a hassle." Schachne also noted that 
an oral agreement between band management and UCSD 
is usually all that is needed. So, for right now it's Wire 
Train. Thank God. 

Touchy Subjects will be 
appearing this Thursday at the 
Spirit Club in San Diego with 
special guests Slo' Ponies and 
Uncommon Ground. On 
Friday, hear L.A. recordin2 
a rtist Circle Jerks plus 
Ministry of Truth and SWA. 
On Saturday the 7th, the 
Flourescent Iguanas will be 
opening for The Jacks 
featuring Buddy Blue and 
Chris Sullivan. For more 
information, contact Mad-
elene at 276-3993.

Jimmy Witherspoon will be 
appearing on Saturday, June 7 
at R pm in Sherwood 

~ 
\\11\1\1111\\11 

Auditorium at the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary 
Art. Born in Alabama in 
1923, Witherspoon is one of 
the last links with the Kansas 
City style of blues singing, and 
he has performed with such 
artists as Miles Davis. His 
honest lyricism and warmth 
of deliverv can be heard in 
such hits a~ "T'ain'tNobody's 
Business," "No Roll in' 
Blues" and "Big Fine Girl." 
Tickets to this special 
performance are available at

plus UCSD and SDSU box

Don't" leave 'home

ut oy a woman who 
obedience-trains his dog back 
home in Baltimore. 

Again, tight plotting and 
relentless action are not what 
you'll find in this novel. What 
you will find are teen-age girls 
complaining about the 
confiscation of their fake 
I.D.'s, a family that is a 

household-hints columnist's 
dream, or nightmare, a 
reckless yachtman and 
publisher who marries Leary's 
sister, a small dog and small 
children. 

To sum, this novel (which 
probably won't be out in 
paperback before the summer 
is over) is a pleasant 

exploration of a pleasant 
character. It would make nice 
summer reading, and at 355 
pages is sure to divert for at 
least an afternoon. If you want 
action, plotting and brevity 
for your beach reading, I 
recommend another compe-
tent Baltimore-associated 
author in Edgar Allen Poe.

Anne Tyler's The Accident-

al Tourist is pleasant and

sort of book Tyler's main 
character would read on 
airplanes if he ever finished 
the 1,198-page book. He's 
been reading on planes for 
years. Macon Leary is the 
main character in a book

a middle-aged man whose son 
died in a hold-up, whose wife 
is divorcing him and whose

He develops strategic plans 
for getting the best seat in 

movie theaters and he doesn't 
like to travel. 

Leary's job is to write travel 
guides for people who don't 
like to travel but who have to 
anyway, ina series called "The 
Accidental Tourist." "I am 
happy to say that it is possible 
now to buy Kentucky Fried 
Chicken in Stockholm," he 
writes . Travel is supposed to 
be broadening, but that idea is 
entirely foreign to Leary. This 
is why his very character is 
changed, his life enhanced, his 
perspective broadened, not by 
a chance . meeting in Tokyo

There is a professor in the 

drama department who 
started teaching here when 
most of us were still infants . 
He could have earned his 
living solely on the basis of his 
talent. In a profession that 
hires less than 2 percent of its 
auditioners, the international 
prestige he brings to the 
campus by his presence is 
great. However, most 
students remember Eric 
Christmas as the high school 
principal in the Porky's films. 
Christmas leaves UCSD at a 
time when theatre in the local 
community is on the upswing. 

"Theatre is a gamble but I 
want to continue working, " 
Christmas said, " I want to act 
in some of the theatres that 
I've had to say no to since I've 
been here." 

For more than two decades, 
Christmas has overseen the 
expansion and notoriety of 
drama on campus. An invited

ERIC CHRISTMAS 
as a person who demanded no 
less than the highest 

"There was a lot of 
disruption in the academic 
world, so I used those vantage 
points to put on a play that 
had some revolutionary 
elements in it, II he said. "The 
way that students dress 
nowadays is an indication," 

Christmas said of the 
differences between yesterday 
and today. "They are neater 
and certainly, superficially, 
more comfortablt!. II 

This year's Undergraduate 
Arts Festival has been 
dedicated to Christmas, who 

is very flattered. A staging of 
Shakespeare's Midsummer 
Night's Dream under his 
direction will be presented 
free this afternoon at 4 pm in 
the Humanities Library 
building room 126 (Studio 
A). 

Continued from page 3 
specified the type of 
architecture our Warren 
Theatre would eventually 
have, Christmas helped 
UCSD's drama department 
become one of the League of 

Pre~professional Theatre 
Training schools. He will be 
remembered by those who 
benefited from is instruction 

disciplinary standards .. 
Christmas recalls the social ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

unrest during his first years of 
teaching at UCSD. He was 52 
years old; the time was the late 
'60s and the first production 
Christmas' students under~ 
took was Marat Sade.
