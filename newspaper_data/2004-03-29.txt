Regents talk of 
higher student fees 

U ndergrad fees could increase 
further to offset grad fee hike 

By GAlLLE FAURE 
News Editor 

The UC Board of Regents dis-
cussed budget and fee increases at 
length during its March 17 meet-
ing, and while 1)0 action was taken, 
scenarios considered included rais-
ing student fees by over 10 percent. 

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
budget proposal has called for a 10-
percent fee increase for UC under-
graduates and a 40-percent fee 
increase for graduate students, but 
fear that a 40-percent hike could 
discourage too many students from 
pursuing a graduate degree at the 
university prompted talks of aug-
menting the undergraduate fee 
hike from 10 percent to 15 percent. 

This comes despite the gover-
nor's recommendation of capping 

fee increases at 10 percent per 
year. 

Vice President for Budget Larry 
Hershman, who made a presenta-
tion on the budget and various fee 
increase scenarios , stressed the 
importance of linking student fees 
and state 'funds . 

"We cannot agree on a student 
fee policy that does not take into 
account the support of the state," 
Hershman said. "We need to make 
it clear to the governor that any fee 
policy has to link fees to the com-
mitment they're making to the uni-
versity.' 

Some expressed concern that 
driving away graduate students . 
would also affect the quality of the ' 
university for both undergraduate

Senior Staff Writer 

Likely Democratic presidential 
nominee Sen. John Kerry (D-
Mass.) will speak at a rally in Price 
Center Plaza on March 30 as part 
of a visit to the San Diego area. 
Students and others can enter the 
plaza through the northeast 
entrance near the shuttle loop 
beginning at 8:30 a.m. 

The raUy will consist of enter-

Brain and 
mind center 
created with 
$7.5 mil. gift 

ByUSAMAK 
Staff Writer 

UCSD announced the inaugura-
tion on March 10 of the Kavli 
Institute for Brain and Mind, a new 
virtual center that will use interdis-
ciplinary methods to conduct 
research on the relationship 
between the brain's cellular makeup 
and the mind's behavior. The center 
will be funded by a $7.5 million 
endowment, announced on the 
same date, from the Oxnard-based 
Kavli Foundation and its founder 
and chainnan, Fred Kavli. 

According to Jeffrey Elman, 
KIBM co-director and UCSD asso-
ciate dean of social sciences, the 
main goal of the new research insti-
tute is to increase interdisciplinary 
collaboration in order to under-
stand the connection between the 
brain and mind. KIBM will consist 
of researchers from over 20 acade-
mic disciplines, including biology, 
anthropology, cognitive science, 
psychology and linguistics. 
Researchers from UCSD School of 
Medicine, the Salk Institute, The 
Scripps Research Institute and the 
neurosciences graduate program, 
which is ranked first in the nation 
by the National Research Council, 
will also be included. 

"There's probably the largest 
collection of people [at UCSD] 
who are interested in the mind and

Regents say Moores' 
views not their own 
By GAlw FAURE 

News Editor 

, The UC Board of Regents 
passed a resolution reaffirming its 
commitment to the use of com-
prehensive review in admissions, 
at the same time singling out UC 
Board of Regents Chairman John 
Moores for his views on admis-
sions and stating that his views 
were not representative of those 
of the board as a whole. 

The resolution, which was 
passed by a vote of 8-6 at the 
March 18 Regents' meeting, 
caused heated discussion among 
the Regents, some of whom came 

to the defense of Moores. The 
resolution states that the views he 
expressed on admissions in an 
opinion article in the March edi-
tion of Forbt:s magazine, as chair-
man of the Board of Regents, do 
not represent the views of the 
Board of Regents. 

"I can't believe this. Here we 
are contemplating the resolution 
to censure a member of the 
board for one article published in 
a magazine," UC Regent Ward 
Connerly said prior to the vote. 
"We will disagree on any number

uc applicants hit by false 
e-mails, Internet glitches 
UC Davis has issued an apology to 6,000 

admitted students who received a n e-mail on 
March 22 indicating that they had received a 
Regents Scholarship, an award that offers stu-
dents up to $7,500 a year toward their college 
costs. 

An additional 800 students were correctly 
notified the same day about their selection for 
the scholarship. Additional e-mails were sent to 
notify these students that their notifications 
were correct. 

This marked the first time that UC Davis 
issued the scholarship via e-mail, with the pur-
pose of reducing printing costs and simplifying 
the process. 

This er~or comes soon after another sys-
temwide electronic glitch in the admissions 
processes. The University of Califomia sent let-
ters March 10 to March 13 notifying over 2,156 
applicants that their Social Secunty numbers 
and other personal infomnation may have been 
viewed online by other applicants. Financial 
infomnation and actual admissions decisions 
were not among the infomnation that could 
have been viewed. Infomnation that may have 
been mistakenly viewed included name, 
address, date of birth, phone number, SAT 
scores and more. 

The problem occurred on the UC Web site 
where students can update their application 
infomnation. The university has issued state-
ments sa~ng that it is currently workins with the 
extemal vendor that serves as a cleannghouse 
for application data systems for the university to 
ensure that this problem does not reoccur. 

CMM West Building 
renamed for George Palade 

Cellular and Molecular Medicine West 
Building has been renamed the George Palade 
Laboratories for Cellular and Molecular Medicine 
in honor of Nobel laureate George Palade. 

A naming ceremony took place at UCSD 
5chool of Medicine on March 16, with Palade 
as guest of honor. 

Palade, who was UCSD School of 
Medicine's founding dean for scientific affairs, is 
widely considered a father of modem cell biol-
ogy and internationally recognized for his pio-
neering use of a combination of electron 
microscopy and cell fractionation, or biochem-
istry, to describe the structure and function of 

cells. 
He received the Nobel Prize for Physiology 

or Medicine in 1974, among many other hon-
ors, including the National Medal of Science. 

Palade was bom in Romania, where he 
earned his medical degree and briefly practiced 
medicine before serving in the medical corps of 
the Romanian Amny during World War II. He 
came to the United States In 1964 to study at 
New York University, soon moving to the 
Rockefeller Institute where he conducted 
groundbreaking work in tissue-preparation 
methods, advanced centrifuging techniques 
and cell fractionation, and studied electron 
microscopy, resulting in the discovery and 
description of several cellular structures. 

He left the Rockefeller Institute in 1973 for 
Yale University, and later moved on to UCSD in 
1990. He retired from UCSD in 2001, but con-
tinues to serve as an advisor at the School of 
Medicine. 

Eledrical engineers will 
condud Defense research 

UCSD electrical engineers will lead a six·uni- -
versity effort for the u.s. Amny to enable troops 
to set up mobile communications networks Or] 
the battlefield. This ad-hoc network would be 
achieved by using lightweight wireless equip-
ment during commando raids and other hostile 
and rapidly<han~ing scenarios. 

The project WIll be funded by about $3 mil-
lion from the Department of Defense over 3 
years, with the option to extend funding to 
$5.25 million over five years. 

This project is one of 3 1 recently approved 
by the Department of Defense's 
Multidisciplinary Program, a $145 million, five-
year effort targeting topics of "exceptional 
opportunity" for defense technologies. 

Ad-hoc networks fomn to have communica-
tion so that peers find each other without a 
centralized network. To effectively deploy in 
fluid tactical situations, peers must be able to 
stay in touch while moving. maintain stealth, 
and avoid enemy jamming and eavesdropping 
on the network. The network will also hav~ to 
sustain itself when peers go out of range or are 
damaged or destroyed. The technology may 
also prove useful for firefighters and police in 
emergency situatiOns where pre-existing com-
munications systems have been knocked out 

The funding will support the work of faculty 
and graduate students at UCSD. including those 
at the Center for Wreless Communications and 
at California Institute of Telecommunications 
and Infomnation Technology.

UC's willed body programs 
under ongoing investigation 

By MARNmE FEDEIIS 
Associate News Editor 

UC President Robert C. 
Dynes recently named former 
Gov. George Deulanejian to lead 
a task force that will study the 
University of California's willed 
body programs, which provides 
anatomical remains for medical 
student training. 

The new task force was created 
in light of the recent investigation 
into the UCLA's wiUed body pro-
gram that distributes donated 
cadavers for medical research and 
education. Allegations were made 
that program officials had engaged 
in selling anatomical remains to 
outside parties. 

Arrests made included pro-
gram director Henry Reid on 
March 6 for allegedly accepting 
money to a nonaffiliate of UCLA. 
Both Reid and another employee, 
clinical director Keith Lewis, have 
been placed on unpaid leave. 
Ernest Nelson, a nonaffiliate of 
UCLA, was also arrested for 
knowingly receiving stolen prop-
erty. 

The task force will review oper-
ations at the different willed body 
programs at UC campuses, includ-
ing UCSD. The task force also 
intends to hold a public hearing in ' 
the summer to receive comments 
from experts and those who have 
concerns about the program. 

According to a press release 
from the UC Office of the 
President, Systemwide guidelines 
will be developed in order to-
ensure that the wishes of donors 
wiU be met. The task force is also 
expected to report its findings to 
Dynes before the end of the year. 

"The willed body programs are 

a valuable component of our 
teaching mission, and the families 
of those who gift their bodies to 
benefit science deserve to know 
that every safeguard has been put 
in place to make sure that their 
remains are treated with dignity 
and respect," Dynes said in a 
statement released on March 18. 

Reid is being charged with 
felony grand theft and is sched-
uled to appear in court on March 
30. The investigation has also 
prompted school officials to sus-
pend the willed body program at 

" The extensive 
investigatiml of the willed 
body program continues. "

UCLA on March 9 after a tempo-
rary restraining order was filed by 
Los Angeles Superior Court 
Commissioner Bruce E. 
Mitchelle. However, cadavers cur-
rently being used in labs to teach 
medical students will remain avail-
able for the rest of the year. 

Meanwhile, police are continu-
ing the investigation. 

"The extensive investigation of 
the willed body program contin-
ues," said UCPD spokesperson 
Nancy Greenstein. "The details of 
the investigation and related pro-
ceedings remain confidential. 
UCPD cannot comment on spe-
cific actions at this time." 

UCLA Chancellor Albert 
Carnesale also made a statement to 

the UC Board of Regents during 
its March 18 meeting regarding the 
arrests. According to Carnesale, 
several actions have been taken by 
the school to look into the problem 
and provide services for families 
who have been affected. 

"Officials responsible for the 
willed body program at UCLA 
thought that the policies and prac-
tices governing the program were 
adequate to protect against 
improper use of the bodies placed 
in our trust," Carnesale said. 
"They were not. Intensive investi-
gations are underway to deter-
mine how the alleged criminal 
activities avoided early detection 
and what must be done to ensure 
that despicable acts of this kind 
will not happen again." 

Carnesale told the Regents that 
the UCLA Audit and Advisory 
Services is also investigating fur-
ther violations of university poli-
cies and assisting the police 
department in evaluating evi-
dence. The Audit and Advisory 
Services is also currently perform-
ing an inventory of donated cadav-
ers. Additionally, the school has 
also created telephone and e-mail 
hotlines to receive inquiries from 
family members of donors. 

"The list of actions is neither 
exhaustive nor final,» Carnesale 
said. "We are determined to iden-
tify all individuals associated with 
violations of law or policy involv-
ing the willed body program, and 
see that they are punished appro-
priately." 

The wiUed body program at 
UCLA receives an average of 175 
donations a year. Hwnan cadavers 
are used to develop procedures 
and facilitate training for sur-
geons.

Proposal aims to raise 
high school standards 
Superintendent asks Regents for 

greater partnership with DC 
By MAlNETlE FEDEIIS 

Associate News Editor 

State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction Jack O'Connell out-
lined how to implement his plan for 
improving high school student 
achievement at the UC Board of 
Regents' March 17 meeting. His 
High Achieving High School ini-
tiative calls for an improved part-
nership between high schools and 
public universities. 

"This will clearly call on the UC 
community to engage in an 
unprecedented fashion with K-12," 
O'Connell said. "If you expect 
more from our students, you will 
get more from our students." 

As part of the initiative, 
O'Connell suggested establishing a 
group consisting of representatives 
from high schools and higher edu-
cation institutions to collaborate on 
exploring how high schools can 
offer more rigorous courses. The 
group would also decide on how to 
create more high school courses 
that would be considered to be 
exemplary and UC-approved "a-g" 
high school courses. 

O'Connell also called for 
expanding instructional opportuni-
ties for future teachers and the 
alignment of K-12 and postsec-
omlary assessments. 

In order to implement the ini-
tiative, O'Connell is sponsoring a 
legislation package that would give 
schools more flexibility in spending 
the $450 million funds given to 
high schools for specific programs. 
The bills would also require stu-

dents to complete the "a-g" courses 
regardless of whether or not a stu-
dent will attend college, develop 
teachers through a California stan-
dards based professional develop-
ment, and create a "sea l of 
approval" for instructional materi-
als that meet specific standards. 

According to Senior 
Communications Advisor to the 
Superintendent Ann Bancroft, the 
initiative would change the focus to 
a higher level of achievement for 
high school students. 

"What the superintendent is 
trying to do is change what high 
school means and change the level 
of preparation that we can assure 
students get in high school," 
Bancroft said. 

Bancroft also said that with 
greater flexibility on the funds, 
schools could choose whether or 
not to focus on the superintendent's 
proposals. 

"The superintendent's bills 
envision giving high schools who 
agree to focus on raising expecta-
tion greater flexibility of their 
funds and building a community of 
support for higher standards," 
Bancroft said. "Some schools could 
choose to have the flexibility and 
focus resources to improving stan-
dards." 

The superintendent first pro-
posed the initiative through his 
state of education address in Feb. 
II. During the Regents meeting, 
he stated that too many high school 
students are unprepared for life

The council only does what its 

constituents demand 
By DANIEL WArn 

Opinion Editor 

The A.S. Council seems to have devel-
oped its own national domestic policy. Not 
that there's anything wrong with that. 

Its resolution, passed March 13, calls on 
Congress to reject the proposed 
u.s. constitutional amendment 

Transgender Intersex Association, among 
others - are well-represented on this coun-
cil and in this year's A.S. elections candidate 
pool. Over 50 of the resolution's supporters 
showed up to the A.S. meeting when the res-
olution faced a vote. The council responded 
to its constituents, revised the original reso-

lution, and passed it. 
In early 2002, the council 

that would ban gay marriage in 
the United States. The Council 
sent the resolution, which 
passed 20-2 with four absten-
tions, to media outlets and gov-
ernment bodies, including the 

PRO again listened to its constituents. The College Republicans brought a resolution before the council, asking it to affirm its 
support for the nation, police 

San Diego Union-Tribune, the 
U.S. Supreme Court and the 
California governor's office. Previous A.S. 
resolutions have renamed the Student 
Leadership Chambers, shown ASUCSD's 
opposition to student fee increases and 
Proposition 54, supported fire fighters and 
police officers in the aftermath of the Sept. 
11 attacks, and asked the UCSD administra-
tion to construct new gender-neutral bath-
rooms. All of these resolutions technically 
did nothing, but their effects on the campus 
community can be significant. 

With the constitutional amendment res-
olution, the council showed its support for a 
vocal constituency whose interest groups -
including the Lesbian Gay Bisexual 

officers and fire fighters. The 
. resolution passed in significant-
ly altered form, but it did pass-

people who wanted a resolution got one. 
The resolution did nothing except show the 
council's regard for its constituents' feelings. 

Each time a resolution passes, people 
complain about the council wasting its time. 
"It could be working on more productive 
thjngs," they say, "like setting up new stu-
dent services, fighting to keep the adminis-
tration honest or defending free speech." 
Yes, the council should work on getting 
Triton Taxi service back to the border. Yes, 
our elected officers should malee sure our 
vice chancellors don't trample our rights.

action is comparable to President George W. 
Bush passing a law that all Mars CItpedi boos 
must respect the Bill of Rights. It's a nice idea, 
but so are most delusions of grandeur. 

ASUCSD should lobby local student

However, the only paper who wiU cover such

'Beer is the answer' and 'the white man d_id it' 
Today's college students tend to follow their own absolutist 
moral codes while shunning relativism and compromise 

Returned 
Yank 

Chris Taylor 

There truly is nothing like spring break away from the university to bring back the 
daunting realization of how dif-
ferent college students are from 
people in the real world. Many 
college students dislike folk of the 
real-world, or at least find their 
mainstream ideas disdainful 
because of these differences. 

One of the more poignant rea-
sons college students disagree 
with people of the real world is 
that, in their perception, there are 
too many absolutists who believe 
only in the black and white and 
reject valid alternative ideas. 

Conversely, real-world tradi-
tionalists and absolutists distrust 
college students largdy because 
college students are seen to be 
rdativistic, wafting with the 
breeze and supporting "whatever 
feels right." To them, srudents 
reject most of the established 
moral codes and status quo by ral-
lying around slogans such as, 
"there is no truth," or "how can 
you be sute you have the truth?" 
However, as convincing as this 
stereotype may seem to the out-
side world, it is not at all true. 
Students do not actually subscribe 
to moral rdativism. In fact, it is 
quite the opposite. As proof of 
this statement, here is a list of the 

moral absolutes that nearly all stu-
dents follow: 

Saualmorals baaed on con-
"nienee: Both the religious 
absolutists and the traditionalists 
believe that college students are 
ezperimenten of souality, bend-
ing morals this way and that. This 
is an absurd falsity. The strict sex-
ual morals of most college stu-
dents can easily be deciphered by 
a set code: the code of conve-
niencc. 

If, for example, it is convenient 
to have sex while drunk, due to 
the enormous amount of excuses 
available to avoid commitment or 
blame, then drunken sell it is. If it 
is convenient to abandon belief in 
committed relationships because 
there is someone next to you that 
you're dying ~o sleep with, despite 
your commitment to another, 
then a strong belief in open-rela-
tionships is in order. 
Unfortunately, convenience tends 
to take a turn for the worse and 
results in other rationales such IS 
the following: "If it is convenient, 
shamelessly combine the category 
of real rape with mere remorse for 
casual sexual activity and punish 
your partner accordingly." 

War it wrong all the time: 
Almost every student likes to 
chime "war is not the answer." If 
there is any risk of war involved, 
then dearly the situation is wrong 
and requires protesting. This is 
blatantly absolutist, in that it 
ignores possible complwties and 
alternative opinions. That is, Stu-
dents have to ignore the fact that 
war has been the answer to sever-
al major world problems, such as 

American slavery or the 
Holocaust. Only absolutists can 
simplify with such ease. 

Furthermore, just like most 
absolutists, students generally 
hold a bit of hypocrisy and break 
their own rules, quietly support-
ing violent revolutionary guerril-
las and child suicide bombers 

" War is wrong aU the time: 
Almost em:Y student likes 

to chime lum is not the 
answer,' If there is any 

risk of ua inooWed, then 
cltmly the situation is 
wrong and requires 

protesting, " 
while loudly shouting "Give 
Peace a Chance." 

Beer is the solution to aU of 
life'. problems: Don't even ask 
what the problem was. This is the 
purest form of an absolutist's 
blind fli th in a truth. 

We matter: It is a finn belief on 
all sides of the political and social 
spectrum that we, undergrads at 
UCSD, somehow matter in the 
larger scheme of things. Right or 
wrong, the belief that every sit-in, 
table, protest, conference and 
poster sits at the base of some vast 
grassroots moYement is absolute. 
This is not a value judgment on the

importance of college events, but 
someone might very well point to 
the number of useless activities us 
college students put our hearts into. 
But in the minds of an absolutist, 
this is more than just defeatist, it's 
wrong. 

The white man did it: Rarely 
will you see a group of people 
cling more dearly to a truth than 
students who believe that almost 
every problem in the history of 
the world was committed by peo-
ple of white skin color. Every 
issue of the J-/)z Fnmttriu, for 
example, blames white America 
for everything from poverty and 
racism to border deaths and crime 
rates. 

Anything we cIiaapee with it 
the wont crime apinR bumani-
ty: Christian fundamentalists are 
stereotyped as condemning every-
ooe and everything to hell if it 
doesn't fit in their dogma. Students 
absolutely hold this value. During 
the lead in to the war in Iraq, stu-
dent protestors shouted construc-
tive criticism such as "Stop Bush's 
Genocide." I must have been truly 
ignorant not to realiu that Bush's 
only goal was to wipe out every last 
non-Kurdish Iraqi. Note also the 
continual use of comparing Bush to 
Hider or comparing Isradi soldiers 
to the SS. Just like the good abso-
lutists we are, it is clearly the best 
strategy to use the worst possible 
injustices as comparable examples 
to everything we disagree with. 
Myopic? Yes. 

Rdativistic? No. 
DMrsity is die holy grail: This 

is perhaps the most holy of moral 
commandments. Those who break 

this commandment will be excom-
municated from valid thought and 
sentenced to a lifetime of wearing a 
white "R" on their chest, for racism. 
Diversity is wonderful, truly, bur ask 
anyone involved with the Student 
Affirmative Action Conunittee: It is 
absolute and it is non-negotiable. 

Ths list is by no means exclu-
sive. College students adhere to 
many strict absolutist moral stan-
dards. If I have forgotten any key 
moral codes, please e-mail the 
address below so that they may be 
properly addressed. In the end, the 
traditionalists of this world should 
not fear that their children are 
learning to deny "truth." 
Admittedly, students have invemed 
their own truth, but they stand by 
that truth as much or more so than 
other traditionalists. True rda-
tivism is a rare belief and generally 
anyone who is rdativistic doesn't 
care one way or another for the 
state of the world, because, who is 
to judge? And in the end, lest it 
seem so, this list is not political. I 
wish I could say that these beliefs 
were accountable only to difference 
in political ideology. 

But then, to make such a gen-
eralization would be simplifying 
the problem. And that would be 
quite absolutist cjf me. 

And with all this ~truth" flying 
around, I could use some rela-
tivism. 

All other perceived student moral 
codes, both in earnest and in mer-
ciless criticism of the author, are 
gladly accepted at the following

Pro: Officers do their work outside of meetings 
continued from page 4 

And the council doer try to do that 
- but not during meetings. 

Most of the work the council 
does 'is "behind-the-scenes." The 
meetings are obscenely long, largely 
because of cumbersome procedural 
rules that govern how the council 
can conduct business . 
Council members' lengthy reports 
on their weekly job duties conswne 
much of the meeting time. The actu-
al business conducted at the meet-
ings consists of approving or reject-
ing what councilmembers have 
already done during the week 
Before spring break, the senate voted 
to approve the charter for the new 
online "Bookswap" program, which 
A. S. Commissioner of Enterprise 
Operations Jeremy Cogan created in 
the days and weeks before the meet-
ing. "This week, the council will 
decide on A.S. Elections Manager 
Tom Chapman's plan to finally 
implement Instant Runoff Voting, 
for which significant research and 
cost calculations were done - again, 
prior to the meeting. All of these 
"constructive" projects take hours of 
work outside · of the weekly 
Wednesday meetings. 

Only negligible time is spent 
writing a resolution. Some senators 
spend less than 20 minutes drafting 

the resolutions they submit to coun-
cil, and others don't write them at all 
- their constituents do, and they 
submit them on their behalf. Much 
as real-life legis1ators in Congress 
gain political capital by submitting 
biIIs written by constituents and lob-
byists, members of the A.S. Council 
hammer out resolutions that cater to 

" Most of the wark the 
council does is 'beJUnd,. 

the '" .. scenes. 
certain student groups. The resolu-
tions don't even have to pass; just the 
fact that the counci1member submit-
ted it means that he can claim to 
have "supported" that student group 
during his next campaign. If it means 
the council spends an extra hour or 
two listening to public input or 
working in conunittee hearings, its 
worth it. The resolution enriches 
both the cowx:ilmember and the 
srodent group who supported it. 
Uncontroversial resolutions are even 
better. Half of the council jumps 
aboard as "co-signers" to claim cred-
it, the bill passes without much 

debate, and everyone goes home 
happy. 

The council does more than its 
share of lobbying, even though it 
cannot actually stop Congress or the 
states from approving the federal 
marriage amendment, nor can it 
force the Building Advisory 
Committee to follow the rules or 
stop Vice Chancellor Joseph W. 
Watson from banning casino nights. 
The A.S. CoWlCil's impact on other 
areas of campus is already affected 
through the scores of representatives 
it sends to campuswide committees. 
In not the council itself that repre-
sents the students' will in these are-
nas, but the conunittee representa-
tives. Concerned with the way Price 
Center or Student Center will be 
built? Talk to Aaron Sheinbein, 
Justin Williams or one of the other 
students representing our interests 
on University Centers Advisory 
Board or BAC. Worried about the 
new Warren Writing grading sys-
tem? Talk to one of the representa-
tives appointed to the Committee on 
Educational Policy. 

The A.S. Council isn't the 6naI 
word in student representation, and 
they're not expected to be. Twenty-
three senators and a Iw1dful of aecu-
rives aren't enough to do everything. 
It's called delegation. 

Con: Resolutions generate scant publicity 
concinUA!d from page 4 

veying all the college councilmem-
bers - and basically anybody they 
could contact - to gauge the stu-
dent opinion on this ~tter. 

This begs the question: When 
was the last time the A.S. Council 
expended this amount of effon on its 
primary job ofimproving student life 
on campus? Sure, the A.S. Council 
will spend hours drafting and passing 
a resolution in fiavor of gay marriage, 
bur it took non-A.S. initiative to cre-
ate something useful for the average 
student such as a free UCSD book-
swap to help students offset stagger-
ing textbook costs. 

Of course, the events surround-
ing the student-initiated free UCSD 
bookswap is an interesting insight 
into how the A.S. Council actually 
operates: 

I . Student Kris Lederer indepen-
dendy created http;/funuw.uaJcJ.ssi-
jitdr.cl1ffl, a completely free UCSD 
textbook exchange. 

2. Kris Lederer is forced to shut 
down due to copyright violations 
due to using "UCSD" in the name of 
his free online business, essentially a 
repeat of the shutdown of the 
http;//'UJ'W'W.ucrduncmsored.cum stu-
dent-run online message boards. 

3. The A.S. Council, in its infi-
nite wisdom, created their own text-
book exchange which charges a fee 
for each book listing, to "help the 
A.S. Council fund more student ser-
vices and events." 

4. Kris Lederer is forced to 
rename his free service to 
hrrp;/funuw.azmpu.rboox.cum. 

Why, instead of co-opting the 
idea of a free UCSD book swap and 
subverting it into a typical piece of 
cosdy A.S. bureaucracy, didn't the 
council simply pass a resolution in 
suppon of nonprofit UCSD stu-
dent-initiated online services? Such 
a resolution could actually work 
toward enacting policy change at 
UCSD. By putting the pressure on 
Student Policies and Judicial Affain 
Director Nicholas A. Aguilar to 
leave UCSD students alone if they 
are nonprofit, ASUCSD could have 
saved both UCSDUncensored.com 
and UCSDClassifieds.com. 

The AS. Council simply has no 
QCUSe for this lack of action. They 
obviously Icnew about UCSD-
Qassifieds.com, since AS. 
Commissioner of Enterprise 
Operations Jeremy Cogan stole the 
idea and created a for-profit varia-
tion almost inunediately after 
UCSDClassifieds.com was shut 
down. The resolution would be ell)' 

to write: Simply assert that, since 
UCSD student organizations are 
allowed to use the word "UCSD" in 
their tide, UCSDClassifieds.com is 
no different. 

But,no. ~teadofpassinga~m­
pIe piece of legislation which would 
shake their image as a group of elit-
ist politicians who celebrate when 
they are presented with the newest 
piece of bureaucracy, the A.S. 
Council decided to pass a pair of res-
olutions thanking A.S. staff Paul 
Dewine and Tracie Davee. Anybody 
with a shred of experience dealing 
with the red tape involved with 
ASUCSD knows that both Paul 
Dewine and Tracie Davee were the 
guardian angels of that corrupt orga-
nization during their tenns of ser-
vice. Yet the simple fact that the A.S. 
Council chose to support their own 
staff with two resolutions, and 
neglected to devote even one resolu-
tion to the battles of independent 
students in regards to 
UCSDUncensored.com and 

" When was the last time 
the A.S. COtmCil 

expended this amount of 
effort on its primary job of 
improving student Ufe on 

campus?" 
UCSDClassifieds.com shows how 
truly self-serving the A.S. Council is 
as an organization. 

Despite these allegations of the 
A.S. Council approaching a near-
incestuous state, one must realize 
that not all council members are to 
blame. There is a secret to passing 
these resolutions: By forcing an 
open roll-call vote. as Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 
representative Daniel Gonzales 
forced during the infamous gay 
marriage resolution, all voting 
memben are forced to publicly 
take sides on an issue. EveD 
though passing these resolutions is 
supposed to indicate the entire 
UCSD campus' suppan for an 
issue, by singling out memben of 
the A S. Council the issue sud-
denly becomes penonal and the 
finger-pointing can begin. 

Cue in point: Earl Warren 
Collqe Junior Senator Everly 

Mariano and Revelle College 
Sophomore Senator Ashley Aluisi 
were the only voting members on 
the entire council who opposed the 
gay marriage resolution. Their 
"no" votes could indicate an opin-
ion that the UCSD campus was not 
unanimous on this heated topic, or 
that they believed that the A.S. 
Council was overstepping its 
bounds with such a delusion of 
grandeur. Yet to the council, and to 
every student activist on campus, 
these "no" votes are often taleen to 
indicate that Mariano and Aluisi 
are homophobic monsters who do 
not believe that two men or two 
women have the right to get mar-
ried. 

You see, it'~ a deceptively simple 
process to force resolutions 
through ASUCSD: Write a resolu-
tion which forces the voting body 
to take a stance on a hot liberally 
minded topic, and dare any voting 
member to shoot it down. All per-
suasive literature is written the 
same way. 

For instance, look at this very 
article. Through subtle (and not-
so-subtle) use of ' adjectives and 
metaphors, the author attempts to 
convince you, the reader, that a 
point of view is correct. "This is just 
fine in the case of flagrantly opin-
ionated journalism, but should gov-
ernmental policy be run' the same 
way? Should the voting body be 
forced to suppon issues which may 
or may not represent the opinion of 
the entire student body for fear of 
being singled out as the staunch 
conservative of the group? 

Whether or not you suppon gay 
marriage is completely and utterly 
irrelevant, this is a fundamental 
problem with A.S. procedure, and 
the perception of the purpose of 
the A.S. Council. Are we, the sro-
dents of UCSD. paying fees to our 
student government so they can 
pursue a political agenda which 
mayor may not represent the mtirt 
rmivmity, or are we paying in the 
hopes that the councills time and 
money be spent toward improving 
the dismal student life at this uni-
venity? 

The gay marriage resolution 
was a noble response to a national 
issue which could. to its merit, haft 
an impact on a number of UCSD 
students. This does not justify such 
a large-scale effort on the pan of 
the A.S. Council while student life 
issues affecting the majority of 
UCSD students are left by the Ifty-
side.

RIAA sues students at 
21 U.S. universities 

UC Berkeley among schools 
targeted across na~ion 

By ALEX DUBILET 
Daily Pennsyfvanian (U. 

Pennsylvania) 
(U-WIRE) PHILADELPHIA 

- The Recording lndustry 
Association of America announced 
March 23 that it has filed a new 
round of lawsuits against illegal 
music file sharers at 21 universities 
across the nation. 

RIM announced lega l actions 
against a total of 532 file sharers, 89 
of whom used "university networks 
to illegally distribute copyrighted 
sound recordings," according to an 
organization news release on 
March 23. 

The RIM did not disclose the 
names of the individuals being sued 
at this point, but will most likely 
acquire the information in the near 
future. 

On average, those who have 
been targeted shared about 800 
files on peer-to-peer network pro-
grams, according to an RIAA 
spokesperson, who wished to 
remain anonymous. Examples of 
peer-ro-peer programs that have' 
been targeted include Morpheus, 
Grokster, Blubster and Kazaa . 

'This round of lawsuits follows 
the previously established "John 
Doe" process by which action is 
brought agalnst a defendant who is 
unidentified. The lawsuit is techni' . 
cally brought against an Internet 
Protocol address - a unique identi-
fier connected to an individual 
Internet connection - requesting 
court subpoenas for further infonna-

tion, 
"These lawsuits are part of a 

larger campaign against the stealing 
of music," the spokesperson said. 

"Our goal is to lower the level 
of piracy, so that legitimate online 
music marketplaces can grow and 
thrive," the spokesperson sa id, 
adding that there are many legal 
ways to acquire music online. 

The current wave of lawsui tS is 
expected ro follow the pa ttern 
established by the first wave earlier 
this year. So far, in the cases filed in 
January, the courts have granted 
preliminary subpoenas that would 
force Internet Service Providers to 
disclose the identities of the file 
sharers. 

Students at other universities, 
including Drexel ~.Tniversiry, UC 
Berkeley, Georgetown and 
Stanford, have been targeted as 
well. 

Penn is just one of the universi-
ties across the nation where the 
level of piracy still remains high. 

"I download songs occasionally, 
so I am not really worried about the 
lawsuits," University of Pennsylvania 
freshman Ron Booker said. "It's real-
ly poindess to have selective lawsuits. 
It doesn't eliminate the problem. It 
just scares People." 

Some students say they will con-
tinue downloading. 

"I don't think it really bothers 
me that much. There are so many 
people downloading that what are 
the chances of me being hit? "

THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS 7 

Moores: Regents reaffirm compo review 
continued from page I 

n't Icnow right now that there are 
a number of members of this 
board who don't agree with 
Moores, I don't know where 
they're living." 

In his Forbes piece, Moores 
wrote that while he has been 
chairman of the board since 2002, 
he is "just one vote." 

"Sadly, today's UC admissions 
policies are victimizing students 
- not just those unfairly denied 
admission, but also many with low 
college entrance exam scores who 
were admirted and can't compete," 
Moores wrote in the piece, which 
was titled "On My Mind -
College Capers." 

Regent Velma Montoya point-
ed out that the piece was titled 
"On My Mind." 

"It doesn't say 'On the 
Regents' Mind,'" she said. 

Other Regents said they were 
in favor of the resolution for a 
number of reasons. 

"It's a question of who believes 
that [this) is damaging to the uni-
versity because it provided a par-
tial argument," Regent George 
Marcus said. "Until it's fully inves-
tigated, I don't think any Regent 
should endanger the reputation of 
the universi ty." 

Student Regent Matt Murray 
cited his concern with the percep-
tion that Moores represents the 
board as a whole. 

"1 do think the chairman's posi-
tion is special, and so 1 will vote 
lor this," he said. 

In his piece, Moores cited his 
October 2003 report on UC 
Berkeley admissions, in which he 
found that, in 2002, 359 students 
with combined SAT scores of 1,000 
or less were accepted while 1,421 
students with SATs above 1,400 
were denied admission. He also 
presented his belief that the univer-

san DebaH 

Watch SRTV forTimes and 
Information on Candidate 
Debates 

sity was discriminating against 
Asians, and that under the cover of 
comprehensive review the univer-
sity, he believes, is "thwarting the 
law." 

The October 2002 report 
spurred UC President Robert C . . 
Dynes to create an Eligibility and 
Admissions Study Group, which, 
after five monthly meetings, pre-

as an attLlCk on free 

speech."

UC Board of Regents 

sented its final report at the meet-
ing, direcdy preceding the discus-
sion of the resolution. 

The study group did not pre-
sent any definitive conclusion on 
whether or not there was any 
cause for worry in the admissions 
process, but did make a number of 
suggestions. These include keep-
ing the 6-percent cap for "special 
admits," whereby campuses can 
admit students who do not meet 
eligibility requirements- some-
times possessing special talents 
such as athletic ability. They also 
recommended that more data be 
provided on academically weak 
students who are accepted, strong 
students who are rejected, and 
appeal cases that result in admis-
sion. 

The group further recom-
mended that a study group on 
admissions be formed to continue 
meeting twice a year, as well as 
recommended making more 
"aggressive" efforts to improve the 
clarity and amount of information 

srlu 

available to the public about 
admissions processes. 

UC Senior Vice President 
Bruce Darling, who served as co-
chair of the study group, said that 
whi Ie the study was "not perfect," 
the group could see that "major 
differences in admissions have been 
substantially reduced at each cam-
pus since Prop. 209 rook effect." 

He voiced that there are still 
minor discrepancies, specifica ll y at 
UC Berkeley and UCLA, which 
req.uire further examination, 
though these are "well within 
what one might accept from a sta-
tistical model." 

"I don't for one minute belie\'e 
they have come up with a final 
answer," Dynes said. "This is a 
dynamic process, and we will con-
tinue with the [areas) we want to 
look at" 

Moores, who was part of the 
study group, expressed some lin-
gering concerns. 

"The study group failed to do 
one thing 1 asked for - it failed to 
provide transparency on the 
admissions process," he said. "I 
think the university is ahead of 
where it was before, but that there 
is a lot of work to do." 

As for his mention in the reso-
lution, Moores called it "outra-
geous." 

"There is delicious irony in the 
fact that much of my work was 
done about Berkeley," he said. "I 
think many people in this room 
are old enough to remember the 
Free Speech Movement." 

He said he saw no justification 
for the resolution at this time, ci t-
ing that Darling's report had iden-
tified unexplained data. 

"This will be seen clearly as an 
attack on free speech," he conclud-
ed, moments before the item 
passed through an open roll call 
vote.

Fees: Dynes' letter warns of increases 
continued from page J 

students and faculty, since many 
graduate students are employed as 
teaching assistants and research 
assistants. 

Matt Kaczmarek, chairman of 
the University of California 
Student Association, argued 
against the fee increase proposals. 

"They're designed to pit the 
needs of undergraduates and 
graduates against each other," he 
said. 

He went on to speak of stu-
dents ' efforts to lobby agaihst 
budget cuts in Sacramel)to and 
encouraged the Regents to do the 
same. 

"When members of this board 
make a statement, people in 
Sacramento listen," Kaczmarek 
said. 

UC President Robert C. 
Dynes and various other Regents ' 
spoke of efforts to convince state 

. legislators of the importance of 
retaining the quality of the uni-
versity in a time where the budget 
is set to be slashed 16 percent 
while enrollment is increasing by 
16 p"rcent. 

"A major university cannot 
survive budget cuts year after 
year," Dynes said . "The fact is, 
public education has to be a prior-
ity for the state of California. The 
future of California really does 
depend on that . I hope the 
Regents will help carry that mes-
sage to Sacramento this spring as 
the budget evolves." 

UC Regent Ward Connerly 
was not optimistic about the out-

come of lobbying efforts, saying 
the Regents needed to recognize 
"the reality of our times." 

"We're in a box, we're in a real 
box," Connerly said. "I think it 
begins with the fact that we're 
dancing with a partner that's lis-
tening to one kind of tune and 
we're listening to another. And if 
we're dancing with that partner, 
we better listen to what tune is 
being played." 

" [The fee increasesl are 
designed to pit the needs 
of undergraduates and 
the graduates against 

each other." 
- Matt Kaczmarek, chainnIn, 

uc Student Assoc:iaIion 

He went on to say that educa-
tion would not be considered a 
right in this "new paradigm." 

"The point I want to stress is 
we JUSt can't tighten our belts and 
go to Sacramento and lobby for 
more money," he said. "If we do 
that solely, at the end of the day, 
we'll find ourselves up a creell 
without a paddle ... Right now 
we're just reacting, and we' re 
going to lose the fight." 

Other Regents agreed with 
him, but stressed that advocacy 

was still important ih the short 
term. 

"The public needs to under-
stand what they're getting," faculty 
representative Lawrence Pins said. 

In a letter released online the 
next day, March 18, but dated 
March 16, Dynes personally 
addressed students and their fami-
lies to warn of future fee increases. 

He wrote that the increases 
would most likely start with the 
2004 summer sessions, and that 
the final dollar amount of the fees 
is not yet Ic.nown. 

"At this point, however, given 
the governor's proposals for stu-
dent fee levels, it is likely that 
undergraduate fees will rise at 
least 10 percent ($489) for the 
2004-05 academic year and may 
go higher," the letter warned. 
"Fees for graduate students are 
proposed (Q rise by as much as 40 
percent, although we hope to 
reduce this figure during the bud-
get process." 

He also encouraged students 
and their families to Ileep financial 
aid in mind, but cautioned that 
due to concurrent decreases in 
financial aid, "all families can 
expect to contribute more to meet 
their expenses." 

The UC Board of Regents is 
expected to set student fee levels 
either during its April or May 
meeting.

"Too often today, 
students get traclled 
through an honors 
course load that is too 
basic for a job, let alone 
for university level, " 
Bancroft said. 

However, some 
Regents voiced con-
cerns of imposing 
courses for students 
who will not be attend-
ing college. 

Regrettably I far too 
many of our high

said . "We 
would love to 
see it happen, 
but there are 
some issues 
that need to be 

workforce. " 

"There are some 
students who never 
intend to attend UC 
or CSU, at least by their course-
work," faculty representative to 
the UC Board of Regents 
Lawrence Pins said. "If all stu-
dents were required to do these 
requirements, would that increase 
the number of dropouts from high 
school?" 

According to O'Connell , the 
improvements would benefit stu-
dents regardless of where they are 
heading after high school. 

"I Ilnow not every single student 
is going to attend a UC campus, 
but I also Ic.now aU of our students 
in hi gh sc hool need to master ski lis

According to Student Regent 
Man Murray, establishing a pan-
nership between K-12 and higher 
education is an important step in 
helping high school students be 
better prepared for a life after grad-
uation. 

"The details of the superinten-
dent's proposals are going to be 
discussed and debated among the 
different groups," Murray said. 
"There were some who raised con-
cerns about details during the

Kavli:

brain, and the quality or the 
researchers is very high," Elman 
said. "We also have a record of dis-
regarding interdisciplinary bound-
aries. The walls between disciplines 
are very low. " 

According to Nicholas Spitzer, 
KIBM co-director and UCSD biol-
ogy proressor, the institute will 
accomplish two objectives. The 
first concerns cross-disciplinary 
education. Researchers will attend 
"boot camps" - intensive one or 
two week-long training programs 
of lectures, discussions and hands-
on experience - in order to 
become familiar with the concepts 
and methodologies unique to each 
discipline. 

The second objective is the sup-
port of innovative research, at both 
the faculty and graduate student 
levels, that can help bridge the gap 
between studies of the brain and 
those of the mind. 

"When you take two existing 
bodies of knowledge, like two 
sticks, and you start rubbing them 
together, you get sparks and then 
fire," Spitzer said . 

KIBM will generate a list of 
research projects by contacting 
UCSD and La Jolla-based faculty 
and encouraging them to submit 
research proposals. According to 
Spitzer, the institute will be as inclu-
sive as possible in its research invita-
tions . 

"From the preliminary discus-
sions we've had .. . we know there 
are many ambitious and smart peo-
ple who are interested in the brain 
and mind," Spitzer said. "So we 
don't anticipate any problems in 
getting interesting proposals." 

Although the rocus of KIBM is 
on basic research, both Elman and 
Spitzer feel that new research 
breakthroughs will ha.e great 
potential benefits to society, partic-
ularly in health-related areas. 

"It's very clear for researchers 
that advances in mental health 
[and] advances in brain disease will 
require understanding the brain as 
a first step," Elman said. 

The Kavli Foundation was 
established in December 2000 by 
KavIi, a Norwegian-born physicist 
and prominent Calirornia business 
leader. The Founsiation is dedicated 
to advancing knowledge in the areas 
of cosmology, neuroscience and 
nanoscience, and has already estab-
lished institutes at Stanrord and UC 
Santa Barbara. The foundation also 
announced the creation of research 
institutes at six other universities in 
the U.S. and Europe - Yale, 
Columbia, California Institute or 
Technology, Cornell, University or 
Chicago and Delft University of 
Technology in Holland. 

"My goal in establishing these 
institutes is to support research at 
the frontiers of science," Kavli said 
in a statement. "I feel that it is espe-
cially important to pursue the most 
far-reaching opportunities and 
challenges and to seek answers to 
the most fundamental unanswered 
questions. " 

At UCSD, several researchers 
are enthusiastic about the benefits 
KIBM will bring to the campus. 

"The UCSD community is 
widely regarded as one or the very 
best places in the world to do neuro-
science research," said Bill Kristan, 
professor and chair or the neurobi-
ology depamnent and director or 
the neurOsciences graduate pro-
gram. "The Kavli Center will help 
to strengthen this reputation." 

The $7.5 million endowment 
also contributes to the $1 billion 
fundraising goal or "The Campaign 
for UCSD: Imagine What's Next." 
To date, UCSD has raised $575.5 
million for the campaign, which is 
scheduled to end inJune 2007.

As a candidate for A.S. president, 
Steve York admits that he has little 
chance to win. However, the John Muir 
College junior hopes to bring a human 
face to students disillusioned by politi-

unity on campus. 
Initially involved in the preliminary

choice to join the Unity slate. 

"1 didn't feel comfortable giving one 
hundred percent to [Students First!), 
which wouldn't give the same in

"I was very adamant about running

not only myself but also the student 
body .. . to make sure that the most 
qualified candidates were elected. n 

Pae touts her ability to work with all 

cians and focus on what he believes are 
serious but ignored campus issues. 

York is running as an independent on 
his own Ignite platform, which criticius 
the administration and A.S. Council for 
the way they handled the Price Center 
and Student Center Expansion Fee 
Referendum and treatment of student 

return," Cogan said. "I wanted to be 
part of a group that is reflective of the 
UCSD campus, not just the A.S. 
bureaucracy. n 

In addition to running for A.S. pres-
ident this year, Cogan has held various 
campus positions. In his freshman year, 
he was involved in several Muir organi-

individuals regardless of slate affiliation 
as well as her strong interpersonal skills 
as the necessary tools to address stu-
dent issues ranging from parking 
scarcity to rising tuition fees. 

As the undergraduate student repre-
sentative on the Chancellor Search 
Committee, Pae says she has built 

media, in addition to widespread student 
apathy. 

Though he's never held elected 
office, York campaigned against the ref-
erendum last year and has monitored the 
administration', proposals after its pas-
sage, which he argues are not consistent 
with what the students voted for. 

zations. As a sophomore, he served in 
dual positions as Muir sophomore sen-

Robert C. Dynes and key Regents. Pae 
believes this network would serve the 
student body well if it came time to 
stand up to state legislators or universi-
ty officials. 

"We need to bring some responsibil-
ity not only from administration, but 
A.S. as well, because right now is when 
the building plans are going into effect 
and certainly they will affect this cam-
pus," York said. "While it's a legitimate

The second area the cam-

The Unity slate's campaign 
also focuses on increased campus

to achieve this by working on a 
campus recruitment and retention 

"I feel that my 
background has 
been very reflec-

Cogan, parking advocacy has

by unrealistic promises from stu-

"Sometimes you have to work 
against the administration, but 
there is never a time you have to

up wilh a palene of Australian 
rum and cokes for our deserted 
throats. Those didn ' t last long and 
after consumption, the group bru-
tally murdered another keg. Atthis 
point, the meeting began 10 pick 
up speed. From Oul of nowhere. a 
fire juggler randomly dropped by 
bringing the one thing every group 
of belligerent drunks desperately 
needs ... FIRE. I watched in a eu-
phoric haze as both Brad and Sam 
attempted 10 tesl their skills. Sam 
caught his pants on fire and Brad 
accidentally caught the lit end of 
the baton like five limes. Jon took 
a disturbing amount of photos of 
the fire . Before we could bum the

ted Banon, the holy grail of credit 
points. He jumped him, ripped 
his glasses off his face, smashed 
them, and then cut Brian multiple 
times with his own lens. Ask 
him 10 show you the scars! 
Afler an indelerminable amount 
of time, panially because of how 
drunk I was, Brian lurched back 
into lhe house, his back and wrists 
cut while he cradled his broken 
glasses. Soon after, Jeremy fuck -
ing maced Sam. Seven members 
got maced thaI night. By the end, 
Ihe house reeked of sweat, blood.

Sioshball: BORED vs. BOARD 
"Bored vs. Boardr' you ask. Bored is how we felt after spanking Board 

Club 18 to 3. It was a cold and rainy day. The kind of rain that called 
for swi m fins . Board club suppliecltwo kegs of Coors and we supplied 
the drinkers. At the field we found lhe very same box from lasl year in 

~hich Pug from the Ultimate Frisbee team vomilled appro~imately 72 
times. We used it for third base. Sioshball hint' I : The tricky part about 
playing in the rain is drinking enough Wild Turkey to SlOp the body from 
shivering, bul still saving room for the beer. Sioshball hint 12: The secret 
about driving drunk in the rain is 10 go through peoples' yards instead of 
on the road. COP5 can't come on pri vate propeny. Anyway, here are the 
highlights from some of our

ilIa one of lheir houses to drink, but the roommates promptly bitched about 
us making a mess in their house. Eight fools got in our faces, acting tough 
cuz they were sober and we were only three, not to mention we were tocally 
wasted. Blows were exchanged, and the three Koalans grabbed the keg and 
took off. Mike got a shiner and I socked someone, not sure who, hopefully 
not Mike. Keg in hand , we went back 10 Kap's, where we each took a victory

PAAARRRGHTY REVIEWS 
Surf Club Party at Reese's in UC 
Surf club threw 8no1her phalty, went straight after work and was greeted 
wilh sweet ballast point. Hay una cover but EI Presidenle Art knows 
how to hook up a friend. Party filled out nicely and there were some 
state girts which never fail to impress. I got prelly shiny and ended up 
jumping the fence and did Hips on the neighbor's trampoline. Apparent-
I y the nei ghbor said he would shoo! the next kid who did that SO heads 
up to everyone getting 'drunk over there. Kegs kepi running out and 
Tobey could only makes so many beer runs. Urn I vaguely remember a 
COIiun trip with Julian and Getting Reese a burrito. Crashed and got up 
the lieU morning for a head shave and sloshball!!!!!!!!! 

Party at Tall John's in La Jolla Village Square 
So we roll up to this .party and the kep were all done, but thaI was ok 
because I _ drinkinll since S. It was hOI in there so I took up my 
shin 10 impress the ladies with my kickin body, but none of them wallled 
to dance, A bunch of people kepi telling me to put my shirt back on, 
but fuck that shit. The last time I checked I was born without a shirt 
on. One girl was talking about her guy friends, 50 I called her a fag 
hag, and she got all upset and kicked me out. Another dude got pissed 
and kicked me out of the other house. That's because the parties were 
in an apl building across the way from each other. He didot wan't to 

fightt/lOUgh. Oh, and oI~~ llias.~re too. but you weren't.

Black's Bonfire 3/6 
Mike and I were hanging out at George's, drinking his beer. and playing 
cards. We heard there was gonna be a bonfire at Black's and so we drove 
over 10 pick up some freshies who wanted to go. Sensing I was a bit 
drunk and concerned with my safety and that of my passengers George 
gave me a mint. At Black's, we got a couple cases of beer, tampico, and 
vodka. II SlBned out with a ratio of like 8: I guys so Mike did what he 
always does in this situation: tried to SlBrt a fight. Mike yelled at some 
dudes to drink the vodka and stop being pussies, but they were much 100 
cool wilh their two-hour beer in their hand. When lhe girts came, Pearl, 
Megan, Lisa, and whoever else, they made the fools look like bitches by 
downing their fair share. We also met a guy who responded 10 Barton's 
ad and said he would kick his ass. Turns OUI he was cool, but I have 10 say 

Barton woulda taken him. I headed OUI 10 pick up this chick who w,anted 
to come to the bonfire, but after climbing up the hill I knew there was 
no way in fuck I was going back up there again. Goddamn I'm lazy. On 
lhe way up some dude gave me some Kahlua, but he didn't accept a ride 
back 10 campus. Ah well. 3 stars. It'd be 4, but my getting laid had all to 
do with my slickness and only a bottle of Kahlua to do with the bonfire. 

Board Club's ABC party @ my house 
bitches 
That's right if you wenllo this you were in a Koala house. Don't you feel 
diny? So I want to start off by sayi ng this will be a completely objective 
review and will be treated like any OIher party. The board club J!CIS full 
props for this pany. It started off with a bang when the cops showed up 
at 10:00 just as people were arriving. I found outlaler they _re called 
because my neighbor was pissed that somebody pissed in his yard on the 
way to the party. What the fuck you idiOl? Is your bladder that pathetic 
that you nead to piss on the way to the party? Anyway the cops told us 
we needed 10 break it up so I said sure thing. But After 8 hours of party 
proofing yeah fucking right. II's worth a night in Jail. Party raged on. 
There were 5 kegs of Slone bn:w, 600+ Jello shots, and a couple of cool-
ers full of jungle juice. Um I'll just say a bunch of cuties with an excuse 
to wear anylhi ng but clothes and enough booze 10 fill a jacuzzi makes 
for a fun night. At one time there was a line thaI wrapped around the 
house. According to our neighbor, who watch us like a fat guy watches 
the clock seconds before lunch time there were 200-300 people there. If 
you want 10 see pies just go to the the board club website http://boar-
datucsd.org/ You're welcome board club for the insane amount of hilS 
you're about 10 get. The cops rolled back at 12 unfonunately just as the 
DJ had got sel up. It was prelly chi II of lhe Po' 10 give us 2 hours but 
they broke il up with a quiCkness. I decided to IlOI go to jail and inslead 
dilched my pancho made of koala issues, put on a cowboy hat and ran. 
I actually ran right past a cop in Ihe my living room who was the same 
one I talked 10 al 10:00. Good eye officer. Since lhey couldn'l get me 
the cOP5 just broke up the party and no one went to jail. Lesson to be 
learned: cops can be cool. All in all it was the sickeSl fucking panyever.

Saradpon: 
Independent 

wants to avoid 
A.S. gi-idlock 

coruinutd from pa,c r, 
for students to get involved on 
campus; 1 am in favor of granting 
more funding to student organiza-
tions that can put fonh an effon to 
incorporate more students and 
increase student participation. 
Even with such a huge campus, no 
one should feel left out," Saradpon 
said. 

A native San Diegan, Saradpon 
is running for president because he 
wants "to malce a difference on cam-
pus and improve the quality of life" 
atUeso. 

"I believe I can bring spirit and 
represent ueso like no other in 
terms of excitement and charis-
ma," Saradpon said. "When 
incoming freshmen or transfers 
come in, I want them to feel the 
energy and passion I have for the 
school." 

While respectful of all partici-
pating parties and their respective 
candidates, Saradpon believes his 
independent status will help avoid 
A.S. gridlock and enhance produc-
tiviry. 

"As an independent, I do not 
carry any favoritism or lean in favor . 
of one slate or another," Saradpon 
said. "If! am elected A.S. president, 
I would want to unite the cabinet 
after elections into one efficient 
body, not a dismembered one full of 
distrust. An A.-S. president is only as 
good as his cabinet." 

Saradpon is arso gready con-
cerned with other issues affecting 
the campus, including the contro-
versial increase of student fees and 
shortage of student parlcing. 

"Sure, I could run for another 
position and I believe that I would 
do well, but why should I allow 
myself to waste a lot of unused 
potential?" he said.

THE HUM AN POP U LA 11 0 N HAS 0 E P L E 1 E 0 the oceans of most of their edible 
life, continues to destroy the world's forests, causes extinction of about 50,000 living species every 
year, and has caused documented global warming accompanied by wild fires and tremendous loss 
of our ice reserves. The human ·population is already far in ex~ of the Earth's sustainable carrying 
capacity and is increasing at a rate of 250,000 people per day. lropical rain forests are currently 
being destroyed at a rate of 25% per year, and this rate is increasing rather than decreasing. Complete 
destruction of the world's rain forests is expected before 2040. Global warming, due largely to C02 
release resulting from fossil fuel combustion, is caUsing massive loss of our glaciers and polar ice 
reserves which provide a temporary temperature buffer. Global warming has already increased 
oceanic temperatures, promoted forest fires in unprecedented proportions, and caused habitat 
alterations worldwide that contribute to species extinction. We are causing an environmental crisis 
of unprecedented magnitude. History and scientific projections suggest we are headed for a massive 
population crash unless drastic preventative measures are taken. Such an event will cause tremendous 
human suffering. Current projections suggest that at least one-quarter of all plant and animal species 
will be extinct by 2050. These issues are far more important than terrorism, war, the U.S. economy 
or individual human life. Rational solutions include reducing the human population through birth 
rate reduction, restricting resource consumption, and promoting the use of alternative energy 
sources. This course will focus on these issues in the context of our complex human society.

resulted in the disqualification of 
the entire Students First! slate last 
year, York says he's been the subject 
of personal attaclcs and hate mail, 
what he calls proof that the campus 
needs a candidate committed to 
"integrity and honesty," 

As in last year's campaign, he 
plans to use Wlique "gimmicks" to 
appeal to and draw attention of vot-' 
ers individually, including giveaways 
of cigarettes, condoms and candy. 

"I think people dismiss word of 
mouth and just dealing with people 
more personally too much," York 
said. "If you get somebody's anen-
tion, that's certainly a powerful 
thing."

Water Polo: Lady Tritons are 
11,14 in regular season play 

continued from page 28 
After allowing three late Cal 

State San Bernardino goals to force 
overtime at 7-7, the Triton defense 
shut out the Coyotes in the first 
extra period and allowed only one in 
the second. Junior utility Courmey 
Clevenger picked it up from there, 
firing home UCSD's second goal of 
the period and the 9-8 game winner. 

Overtime could have been avoid-
ed if UCSD had a little more luck on 
their side. Cal State San 
Bernardino's first two goals came on 
a defensive deflection by senior 2-
meter Lesha Bounds' and through a 
shot that struck the crossbar and ric-
ocheted off the back of sophomore 
goalie Kaitlin Foe's head. 

"Sometimes it's better to be 
lucky than be good," Sanders said. 

Against Redlands on March 26, 
Bantilan-Smith scored two goals in 
the first half and sophomore driver 
Flynn LaRochelle tallied with 4 :41 
left in the third for a 4-1 advantage 
that melted by the 4:33 mark in the 
third, with Kelly Phillips' goal to 
draw the Bulldogs within one. But 
the UCSD defense rurned into 
stone, shutting down all of 
Redlands' efforts, including a six-

on-five with· five seconds left. 
Fueled by goals from Bantilan-

Smith, Bounds and freshman 2-
meter defender Sarah Bajorek, the 
Tritons were on top of Cal State 
Northridge for the better part of 
three periods before the Matadors 
scored twice in the third and Chari 
Christopher put one in the cage 
with 2:44 left for a 5-3 lead. 

Still, the Tritons kept on push-
ing, holding defensively on Cal 
State Northridge's last two posses-
sions while junior utility Tobi 
Lyman found the back of the net 
on a six-on-four advantage with 
1:44 left. UCSD's final push was 
thwarted by a Cal State Northridge 
steal with nine seconds left. 

Fatigue may have also had a hand 
in UCSD's offensive sputters. A 
week of "triples" (days with three 
workout sessions) left the usually 
alert Tritons "physically ... and men-
tally tired," Sanders said. 

The Tritons get a lengthy break 
to build on team focus before 
opening Canyonview Pool for a 
face off against Cal State San 
Bernardino on April 8 at 6 p.m. and 
UC Santa Barbara on April 9 at 3 
p.m. 

Track and field starts 
regular season strong 
Men and women crowned 
San Diego City Champs 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's track and 
field team performed impressively 
at the March 13 San Diego City 
Championships, emerging victori-
ous over Division I rival San Diego 
State, and finishing first among six 
teams. The Triton men also posted 
a victory by leading . in the final 
standings ahead of three oppo-
nents. 

"We had a huge day especially 
on the women's side against 
SDSU," head coach Tony Salerno 
said. 

The Triton women out5Cored 
the Aztecs 217 to 204 , with Cal 
State San Marcos (69), Point Loma 
Nazarene (60), Alliant International 
(9) and University of San Diego (7) 
also in the competition. 

UCSD had a number of indi-
vidual highlights in the meet. 
Sophomore Kaylin Siever's first-
place showing of 39 feet, 8.75 
inches in the triple jump was a 
school-record and an NCAA 
qualifying mark. Siever was also 
notable for finishing second in the 
long jump. 

Junior Meredith Perry ran 
14.38 to garner a second-place fin-
ish in the lOO-meter hurdles, fast 
enough to be an NCAA Division II 
qualifying standard. 

Freshman distance sensation 
Tma Firouz took first in the 3,000-
meter race with sophomore team-

Pacific Tour & Travel 

mate Michelle DiMeo running 
right behind her. Firouz and 
DiMeo finished in NCAA qualify-
ing times of 10:12.94 and 10:14.98, 
respectively. 

Senior thrower Sagrario 
Hernandez did double duty, per-
forming and winning both the shot 
put by 45-2 112, and the hammer 
throw, reaching a distance of 160-
6. 

Senior Michelle Beebe excelled 
in the javelin, throwing 131-7 and 
taking first. Other first-place fin-
ishers were freshman Torrey Trust, 
a discus specialist who threw 123-
7, and junior high jumper Kelsey 
Turner, with a jump of 5-5. 

San Diego State still had a few 
standouts, despite its team's weak 
overall showing at the meet. 
Tonerre Dyer won 90th the 100 
(11.61) and 200 (23 .69), while 
teammate Nicole Ireland finished 
second in each event (1 \.89, 
23 .85). 

Heather Heron swept the hur-
dles events, taking both the 100-
meter (13.61) and 400-meter races 
(1 :00.64). Dyer and Herop were 
also on the first-place 400 relay for 
the Aztecs, which finished with a 
time of 45.37. 

J amillah Titus was a final dou-
ble-event winner for SDSU, as she 
came in first in the 800 meters 
(2 :15.93), and as a member of the 
1,600 relay.

game and came up just short." 
On March 21, the Tritons 

completed the final two games of 
the series against Cal State San 
Bernardino. The series was inter-
rupted earlier in the season due to 
rain. UCSD rallied in ' the bottom 
of the ninth in the first game of 
the twin bill to beat the Coyotes 
6-5. Cal State San Bernardino 
answered in the nightcap as they 
inched out a victory over the 
Tritons 3-2. The tearns ended up 
splitting the series at two games 
apiece. 

UCSD squared off against 
Division I Air Force on Mar. 24. 
The Tritons downed Air Force 
10-2. UCSD scored in each of the 
first four innings and quickly 
jumped out to a 9-1 lead. Junior 
designated hitter Joel Clark hit a 
two-run double in the four-run 
second inning, while Riddle belt-
ed a two-run double to center 
field in the fourth. The Tritons' 
final run of the game came off 
senior David Hawk's bat in a 
pinch-hitting role in the seventh, 

and the team's third sacrifice fly of 
the afternoon. O'Brien used 25 
players in the matchup. 

"All things considered, I 
thought we played well," O'Brien 
said. "It was not easy for the guys 
to get themselves ready to playa 
doubleheader on the Sunday of 
finals week. They were more them-
selves after two good workouts fol-
lowing the games, and the team 
showed what they're capable of 
against Air Force. This team con-
tinues to get better and build con-
fidence. We're a solid ball club, but 
it's time to go from good to great. 
This team has the make up to do 
that. " 

UCSD finished its rune-game 
homestand with a series against 
Sonoma State March 26 to March 
28. The series between the two 
teams was not completed at press 
time. 

The Tritons will , take on 
Vanguard University in a noncon-
ference game on March 31 before 
going on the road for a four-game 
series April 2 to April 4 against 
CCAA leader UC Davis.

The only teams to best UCSD 

were No. 2 Cal State Bakersfield

Cal State Bakersfield took first 
place, turning in rounds of 285, 
299 and 295, giving the 
Roadrunners a total score of 879, 
finishing 15 over par. CSUS netted 
rounds of 292, 302 and 287, to fin-
ish with 881, 17 over par. 

Individually, the Tritons cracked 
into the top ten once again as 
senior team captain Alan Scheer 
placed ninth with a, score of 218, 
two over par. Scheer started March 
22 with a 71, md despite a slight 
setback of a 76 on that afternoon, 
he returned to form on the 23rd 
with another 71. 

"It's great to see AI coming back 
and playing better," Wydra said. 
"He's the star of the team, and we 
go how he goes." 

JWlior Joe Dolby came in second 
for UCSD, and tied for a 16th place

Sophomore Ryo Yamada placed 

third for the Tritons and tied over-
all for 23rd place. Though he 
struggled early with a 79, Yamada 
followed up with a 75 and a 72 to 
give him a 226, IO over par. 

"Rye has been a reaIJy interesting 
addition to our team, after he earned 
a spot onto the team at Santaluz," 
coach Wydra said. "It was really 
windy the second day, but he man-
aged to maintain a two under par

round, I ubd him to change back 
to his previous style, and he

26 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, MARCH 29, 2004 

Track: UCSD won 13 of 19 
events, dominated field events 

Volleyball: Dierdorff has career high 58 assists 
continued from page 12 

On the men's side, UCSD, scor-
ing high with 243.5 points, was able 
to decisively outdistance Point 
Lorna Nazarene (132.5), Cal State 
San Marcos (89) and Alliant 
International (45). 

Triton athletes won 13 of the 19 
events, including every field event 
except the discus. 

Sophomore Jon Patton toolc 
first in the 2oo-meter race, running 
21.97, while fellow sophompre 
Man Borzage was the winner of the 
4oo-meter race with 49.57. Panon 
and Borzage were among the first-
place UCSD runners competing 
with the 1,600 relay team, taking 
first with 42.23. 

Osgood's javelin throw went 185-7 
and Libuit's shot put went 44-3 1/4; 
both performances were good 
enough for first place. 

Junior Hans Van Dale had a 
hammer throw of 169-7, which was 
another event-winning throw. 

Though UCSD's rivals at the 
meet were playing with injuries, 
including SDSU, the Tritons came 
to the meet well-prepared and 
ready for the Division I competi-
tion; the sheer number of event 
winners clearly indicates UCSD's 
versatility in the variety of track 
and field events. 

"They had a couple of injuries 
that gave us some scoring opporru-
nities that we toolc advantage of, 
but mostly we had a great day," 
Salerno said. 

continued from page ~8 
I run to the delight of the 202 
raucous fans in attendance. The 
Tritons were able to keep the 
lead at three points for much of 
the early going, but the Anteaters 
threatened by closing to within 
two at 12-10. Junior outside hit-
ter Adam Toren put down a kill 
to stretch the UCSD lead back to 
three points before sophomore 
outside hitter Jeff Urton 
slammed consecutive leills to 
close things out, 15 -1 O. 

Toren finished with 25 leills on 
a .327 hitting percentage to take 
match-high honors and was 
rewarded for his effort by being 
named the MPSF Player of the 
Week for March 8 to March 14. 
Senior opposite Jim Waller had 
19 leills in addition to picleing up 
12 digs to share the team-high in 

digs with Urton. Freshman setter 
Brooks Dierdorff established a 
new career high with 58 assists on 
the night. 

After a layoff through finals 
week and most of spring brealc, 
the Tritons returned to action 
against a Stanford squad that 
UCSD upset at home on Jan. 24, 
for what was arguably the 
Tritons' biggest win of the sea-
son. The Cardinal were not 
about to let UCSD enjoy an 
encore as Stanford took control 
early and never relented for a 30-
25, 30-27, 30-24 sweep. Waller 
led UCSD with 14 leills while 
senior middle hitter Kevin 
Keyser had four total blocks to 
lead the Tritons while also rack-
ing up eight kills without a hit-
ting error. 

Unfortunately for UCSD, 

revenge was not in store the fol-
lowing night as the Tritons were 
unable to beat the Pacific TIgers 
for the 23rd consecutive time, 
falling 30-28, 30-21, 30-23 . 
UCSD held a 24-18 lead in game 
one, but surrendered a 12 -4 run 
and the game. The Tritons were 
unable to recover in games two 
and three. Waller once again led 
UCSD with 15 IeiUs while senior 
Iibcro Dickens Tai had 12 digs. 
Senior middle hitter Andy Rupp 
had four total blocks on the 
evening to lead UCSD while fel-
low middle Keyser hit an efficient 
.571 with nine kills. 

The Tritons return [0 action 
April 2 and April 3 against 
Brigham Young University to 
open a five-game homestand that 
concludes UCSD's home sched-
ule. 

Several hurdlers were event 
winners, including sophomore 
Mike Cunningham, who ran 15 .11 
in the IIO-meter hurdles, while 
freshman jC Inauen won the 400 
hurdles in 55.72. 

Some other competitors were 
able to stand out, although UCSD 
athletes accounted for the majority 
of event winners for both the men's 
and women's teams. Josephat 
Keino was a double winner for 
Alliant [nternational in the 800-
meter (1:53 .62) and the 1,500 
(3:54.47). 

box STATS MEN'S VOlLEYBALL n. UC IRVINE 
Senior Eric ilsen was the 

3,OOO-meter steeple winner, reach-
ing the finish line first in 9:46.50. 

T he jumping events also had a 
large number of high scorers that 
were able to help elevate UCSD 
above the other competitors. 
Senior Pat Ruttinger won the pole 
vault, first with a height of 14- 10, 
while fellow senior Marcus Keller 
was the triple jump winner, rising 
above the compe'tition at 46-2. 

Sophomore TIm Bailey was the 
long jump winner at 21-0 112, and 
junior Kevin Beeman finished first 
in the high jump, reaching a height 
of 6-43/4. 

Sophomores Ryan Osgood and 
Brad Libuit shined in the javelin 
and shot put events, respectively. 

Terrance Hale from Point Lorna 
Nazarene won the discus with a 
mark of 164-11, while the Sea Lions 
also earned top honors in the 1,600 
relay at 3:20.44. 

The meet was an impressive vic-
tory for both the men and the 
women because of the caliber of 
competition offered by the oppo-
nents, especially San Diego State, a 
Division I school. 

"SDSU was CaliforniaINevada 
State Champions last year as well as 
Mountain West Conference 
champs," Salerno said.

blasting her fifth home run of the 
season while going 2-3, with two 
runs and an RBI. Senior shortstop 

Kim Aggabao also went 2-3, with 
one RBI and one run. 

Any thoughts of UCSD being 
overwhelmed twice by Cal State 
Stanislaus were quickly dispelled in 
the second game of the doublehead-
er, as the Triton's exploded for 15 
runs, winning 15-2 in six innings. 
Senior Jodie Bland walked away with 
the victory, giving up on two earned 
runs in six innings of work. Her sea-
son record stands at 7-6.

plate. leading UCSD with three 
hits, one RBI and two runs. Bland 
was assisted by senior third base-

twice and grabbed two RBIs while 
going 2·5. Aggabao went 2-3 again, 
and added a run and an RBI, while 
sophomore second baseman 
Desiree Franciscus drove in three 
teammates and scored twice. 

The Tritons were back in action 

on March 13 against Cal State 
Bakersfield, but once again dropped 
the first game of the doubleheader, 
this time 2 -7. Rowe suffered her 
first defeat of the season, dropping 
her record to 7 -1 as she gave up six 
earned runs in six innings. 

Despite a sluggish offense, 
freshman designated hitter Melanie 
Meurer had a solid performance, 
going 2-4 and netting a run and an 
RBI on a solo blast, her third home 
run of the season. Sophomore Nilei 
Anderson lcnocked in the other 
run, going 1-3. Aggabao scored, 
also went 1-3. 

UCSD came back again in the 
second game of their doubleheader, 
this time besting Cal State 
Bakersfield 5-3 behind a strong 
performance from Bland, who gave 
up only one earned run in seven 
innings of work and improved her 
record to 8-6 for the season. 

Offensive highlights included 
Aggabao's three RBI, as well as 
freshman centerfielder Britmi 
Carino going 2-2 and tacking on an 
RBI. Mettee went 2-4 and nabbed a 
run, while Bland went 1-3 with one 
run. Both Cope and Franciscus also

Ciolf takes third at 
Coyote Classic tourney 

Second consecutive third-
place finish for Tritons 
By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

The No. 6 UCSD golf team 
came in third place in a field of 14 
teams at the Cal State San 
Bernardino Coyote Classic 
Invitational from March 22 to 
March 23 at the Hesperia Country 
Clup in Victorville, Calif. 

Por their second straight outing, 
the Tritons came home with a third 
place finish, this time shooting an 
888 to finish 24 over par. With a 
strong start on March 22, UCSD 
shot 292 in their first round. The 
Triton came back in the afternoon 
to shoot a 302 , but once again 

dipped below 300 on March 23, 
finishing with a 294. . 

The Tritons defeated No. 4 fin-
isher Western Washington 
University by one stroke. UCSD 
also finished ahead of No. 3 
University of Hawaii-Hilo. 

"As far as quickness of the greens 
were concerned, I would equate 
them to a 1978 shag carpet," Wydra 
said. "The course wasn't really up to 
the standards of college tours, and I 
think the players were scoring in 
spite of the conditions, instead of 
because of them. Still, it was proba-
bly the most fun course of its kind

Women's water polo takes 2 of 3 
Series of close finishes end in Tritons' favor 

By DANIEL DIAl 
Staff Writer 

The No. 14 UCSD women's 
water polo team finished their 
spring break at the Loyola 
Marymount Tournament from 
March 26 to March 27, holding 
off Redlands 4-3 and doing one 
better than WWPA foe Cal State 
San Bernardino in overtime, 9-8. 
They fell short against No. 20 Cal 
State Northridge, 5-4, to finish 2-
1 on the swing and stand at 11-14 
for the season. 

The Tritons struggled in the 
second half against their unranlced 
opponents, letting 3-1 and 4-2 half-
time leads against Redlands and Cal 
State San Bernardino slip away. 
Senior 2-meter defender Meris 
Bantilan-Smith's seven goals 
proved that the scoring opportuni-
ties were plentiful, but the Tritons 
couldn't quite get those one or two 
extra goals to pad their lead. 
Against Cal State Nonhrldge, 
UCSD tooIc 20 shots and created 
seven different man-up opportuni-
ties, yet only scored two in the sec-
ond half. 

"What happened was some-
thing like basketbaU, where we 

were doing stuff, creating ... Our 
six-on-fives were executed perfect-
ly, but the ball simply wasn't 
falling," UCSD head coach Larry 
Sanders said. The Triton defense 
was resilient when it counted most, 
limiting both the Roadrunners and 
the COYOtes to one goal in the final 
period and tipping those close 
games in favor of the Tritons. The 
UCSD defense has accrued a low 

5.44 goals-against average in 2004, 
led by individual performances like 
goalie Stephanie Lombardo's 10 
saves against Cal State San 
Bernardino. 

"The gals didn't give up, they 
played to win. They know they 
struggled, but they didn't lose 
their focus," Sanders said.
