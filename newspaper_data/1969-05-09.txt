BenjaminrPalcic Elected 
Jeff Benjamin and Mike 'Heavy' 

Palcic survived a run-off with 
the Waxman-Butler ticket Wed-
nesday, and will assume office, 
along with the other elected AS 
officials, on May 21 at the annual 
Installation Banquet. 

The run-off was necessitated 
atter both Benjamin and Heavy 
tailed to receive the necessary 
majority on the first ballot by 
some 40 votes. The final per-
centages were 57% for Benjamin, 
who succeeds Tom Shepard as 
AS President, and 55% for Heavy, 
who assumes the office of AS 

The turnout for both elections 
was extremeley light, with not 
more than 33% ot the eligible 
voters having participated. With 
an undergraduate population of 
2600 at UCSD the highest total 
of votes for anyone ottice was 
943. 

The senators who were elected 
outright in Monday's el'ection, 
having received the necessary 
majority of votes of their res-
pective constituencies were 
James Magill, upper division 
senator; Cindy Neilsen, Revelle 
senator: Leonard Bourin • Muir 
senator and Steve Ishmael, Muir

Senate Impasse Leads to 
Brief Takeover of Regi_trar 

Wednesday afternoon, UCSD 
was the rare scene of a bold 
demonstration of student power. 
Following the frustrating Aca-

'demic Senate meetings, about 
fifty student~, led by members 
of Black Students' Counsil and 
Mexican American Youth Asso-
ciation, occupied the Registrar's 
office in protest to the apparent 
inability of the faculty to act 
without delay on the proposed 
Lumumba-Zapata College. 

After their walkout from the 
Academic Senate meeting in HL 
Aud., members ofBSCand MAYA 
clustered around the fountain in 
the Revelle plaza with some of 
their faculty and student sympa-
thizers. They discussed what 
was happening in the meeting and 
what their response should be. 
Several possible courses of ac-
tioil were proposed. 

About the time that the senate 
meeting was in a short recess, 
the students disbanded. They 
gathered again at 5:30 pm in 
the grassy quad facing the fire 
station on the Matthews Campus, 
as had been decided upon an hour 
before at the Revelle fountain. 

At this time several black and 
brown students announced their 
decision to occupy the Re-
gistrar s office and asked all 
those who supported them to join 
in this action. About 50 persons 
then marched towards the build-

RU"'per, Machan 
D.bate on Thurs. 

A public debate on capitalism 
and socialism will be held next 
Thursday in the Revelle cafe-
teria. Tibor Machan, a student 
at UCSB working on a Ph.D. in 
philosophy, and Herman Rumper, 
a student at UCSD, also working 
on a Ph.D. in philosophy, will 
discuss the basic philosophic is-
sues underlying capitalism and 
socialism. 

Machan, who is being brought 
here by the UCSD Students of 
Objectivism and UCSD- YAF, is 
described as an objectivist-lib-
ertarian. He has written articles 
for "Barron's" and" Freeman" . 

Rumper has been involved with 
radical politics on this campus 
and could be called a member of 
the New Left. 

The event is scheduled for 
Thursday, May 15 at 8:00 p.m. 
in th Revelle cafeteria. It Is free

invited and there will be an ad-
mission fe for' them. 

ing and entered the office alter 
an unidentified person had 
smashed the glass in the door. 

The crowd that gathered around 
the building grew, some standing 
immediately outside the office at 
the request of those inside, who 
had asked that "those who sup-
port us but do not want to come 
inside' show their sympathy in 
this manner. 

While the occupation of the 
building was taking place the Aca-
demic Senate was proceeding in 
its deliberation of the hybrid re-
solution proposed by Verrone of 
the Med. School. They were 
informed oC the take-over, pro-
ceeded in their discussion, and 
approved the measure. 

After the meeting had 
concluded Dean Murphy invited 
those who had supported the mea-
sure to proceed to the Registrar's 
office to inform the students of 
the action taken. So, at about 
6: 15 a contingent of faculty mem-
bers with Murphy at its head was 
seen marching towards the office. 

Howe ver, the first faculty 
members to arrive with news 
of the Academic Senate meeting 
were Dr. Carlos Blanco, Pro-
fessor of Spanish Literature, and 
Dr. Watson, Assistant Professor 
of Chemistry. They have been 
closely associated with BSC and 
MA YA in the past and were per-
llIitted to enter the office through 
a window. 

The resolution that had just 
been passed was read to the 
demonstrators and discus-

sion ensued as to its significance. 
Dean Murphy arrived and sought 
admittance, but was informed that 
Blanco and Watson were already 
in the process of briefing those 
inside. 

While the demonstrators inside 
were deliberating as to what 
course of action they should pur-
sue, the resolution that had been 
passed was read to the crowd 
and a graduate student attempted 
to explain what had been happen-
ing at the Senate meeting. 

Finally, the demonstrators de-
cided to vacate the building by 
a vote of 29-23. As all the 
actions had been taken as a group, 
those who wished to stay were 
persuaded to bide by this deci-
sion. 

A major factor in the decision 
was the message that had been 
relayed to those inside concern-
ing their status as regarded vio-
lations of university regulations. 
Dean Murphy had made it clear 
that, as of that time, he kn w 
of no such violation, with the 
exception of the breaking of the 
door. Furthermore, he didn t 
know who had commit ed that 
act, so he wouldn't be able to 
prosecute anyone. He gave them 
his word that if they vacated 
the premises there would not be 
any disciplinary action. 

Later, in a press conference, 
Murphy stated that he was bound 
by his word and would not renig 
on what he had said. When 
asked by reporters why the stu-
dents had taken such action he 

replied that it was probably be-
cause of "a deeply felt sense 
of frustration' that resulted from 
what aru>eared to them to be "a 
parliamentary game. ' 

In a statement distributed to 
the student body yesterday BSC 
and MAYA explained their 
actions. It appears that they 
felt that th ir demands had been 
met to some extent in the re-
solution passed by the Senate. 
This was cited as the reason 
for the leaving the building. 

However, BSC/ MAYAqualified 
the statement by adding: "It 
should be understood that the 
passing of the re olution has been 
a significant advance, but we still 
do not have Lumumba-Zapata. 

T occupation of the building 
took place at 5:45. The students 
were in the office for 80 min-
utes. Outside of the broken 
glass door no actual damage 
was done, although the office 
was somewhat disarrayed after-
wards . 

Chancellor McGill was on a 
plane at the time and could not 
be reached for comment.

Due to the lack of ability of

itself to our demands, MAYA

day's senate meeting. The sen-
ate insisted on going through 
their parliamentary acrobatics. 
This lack of progress necessita-

the registrar's office was this 
course of action. BSC, MAYA,

Academic Senate Meetings 
Heighten. Student Confrontation 

This resolutivll was in response 
to the action taken by the Senate 
on Wednesday. 

by Paul Emus 
The two Academic Senate 

meetings this week proved to be 
not only its typical arena of 
confusion and frustration but also 
a theater for confrontation and 
crisis. Meeting in the HL-
Aud., an unusually large atten-
dance of faculty discussed the 
proposed Lumumba-Zapata Col-
lege with what many students 
considered a "parliamentary 
game' or "academic exercise." 

The following is a chrono-
logical description of the main 
events of the meetings leading 
up to the student walk-out and 
the passage of the Verrone re-
solution: 
~.~~ •••• ~ MAY 6 •••••••• 

The meeting on Tuesday began 
with the usual hass Ie over stu-
dent observers. Chairman Wal-
ter Munk insisted upon only al-
lowing 28 seats aside from the 
eight for the L- Z negotiatinf ' 
group. Dr. Schultz challenged 
that there were more than 28 
Observers, a comment which 
drew an amusing remark from 
Prof. Kirby that "You've just 
pulled the trigger!" In any 
event, the threat of recess moved 
out the excess stUdents. 

Third College Provost Rapport 
reported on the five meetings 
between the eight members of 
the planning board and eight 
members of SSC/ MAYA. Rap-
lllPort at this point presented 
the resolution which had been 
produced by the committee (see 
text). 

In the discussion which 
followed BSC/ MA YA were called 
upon for their fee lings on the 
Rappaport Resolution. Azzan Da-
vis of SSC responded after Prof. 
Schultz again challenged the legi-
timacy of this representation. 

Calling for a "first rate in-
stitution relevant to our needs 
... not just your needs, Davis 
said that the new FTE allocation 
system "insures that the interest 
of minority students are served ." 
"I claim that the reason for stu-
dent unrest is that you have not 
given students a voice." 

He further said that "the min-
orities effectively and legally" 
voiced their views " in a mean-
ingful, significant rational way" 
only to be met with "breaking 
the rules . ' Israel Chavez, a 
representative of MAYA, com-
mented on the need for a 50% 
voice "which we feel is ade-
quate. " 

Prof. Simon called upon the 
departments to encourage the 
recruitment of faculty "com-
mitted to the aims of progress." 
Concerning the students asking 
for a st rong voice in the uni-
versity for change, Simon said 
that "we are on the verge of 
an experiment and any experi-
ment carries a certain amount 
of risk. ' Prof. Kohn com mented 
on the resolution assum ing a 
"major emphasis".to meet 
the needs of black < nct brown 
s tudents. ' Kohn poinhd out that 
"the Pr ovost would be weak " 
and that .. students by .latur e are 
inexperienced in educ;.tional po-
licy. ' 

Prot. Halstrom, chl.i r man of 
the rules committee, looked at 
the legal aspects of thl proposal 
considering "the standlngorders 
of the Regents, ' an j insisted 
that the faculty be the main 
governing board instE ad of the 
proposed Board of uir ec tors . 

At this point , the faculty, in 
their true parliamentary tradi-
tion, moved for a motion to table 
the previous resolution , rose to 
points of order or information, 
and were so confused that one 
faculty member remarked: "i ' m 
completely in the dark ; I don't 
know what 's going on.' 

After postponing the Rappaport 
resolution until 5:15 pm, Prof. 
Jamison quirped: "Just what 

are we to do between now and 
5:157" McGill was concerned 
about the character of the dis-
cussion and that by proceed ural 
devices it could be construed as 
trying to avoid the issue. This 
resulted in a proposal of "acom-
mittee to advise the committee" 
and Prof. Marcuse walked out. 

Prof. Schultz again rose on 
a point of information que stioning 
the munutes on the negotiation 
committee, and Prof. Baron re-
marked that "we shouldn't dis-
cuss these in this large senate" 
indicating the general fee ling of 
being snowed under with rhetoric. 

At this point Azzan Davis rose 
to say that "Dr. Rappaport bas 
entirely misled us" concerning 
the Academic Senate. Davis 
referred "all the silly little 
games that you men with PhD's 
play" and further called the fa-
culty "immature". He then 
threatened a walk-out unless 
some immediate action was 
taken. 

Professor Kirby pointed out 
that "we must force the bur-
eaucracy to accomodate to us' 
and that "we have to stop this 
quibbling and figure out how we 
as an Academic Senate can change 
this.' 

Prof. Frazier played around 
with some illegalities and moved 

his reso lution as a 
substitute motion before the 
house. More points of order 
were raised. The parliamen-
tarian was consulted and he gave 
a barrage of technicalities which 
confused e~ryone even more. 
The Chancellor moved for a ten 
munute recess. 

Readjourning, the observer s 
were kicked out again. 

Davis then addressed the Se-
nate s tating that there is "no 
reason why we should negotiate 
with people that treat us in this 
manner. ' Another black s tudent 
commented "BSC/ MA YA won't 
sit and listen to more parlia-
mentary bullshit." 

Prof. Broch noted that "what 
I've observed is a surrealistic 
performance of very sober peo-
ple .... whHe Rome is burning," 
and called for a reversal of prior-
ities. 

SSC / MAYA informed the Se-
nate that they would no longer 
sit down with the negotiating 
committee because they felt that 
it had been shown to have no 
power; they charged the faculty 
with "playing games with us .' 

After tooling with an amend-
ment to the amendment, and fil-
Jibustering in what Dr. Arnold 
ca lled the "Senate Tradition,' 
a motion was finally carried to 
end debate. The Rappaport Re-
solution carried by 87-34 and 
the Senate recessed for 24 hour s. 
~~Hf-:!* MAY 7 ****",.&-r.-lH 

Wednesday's Academic Senate 
meeting was initiated by the 
Blanco Amendmant (see text) 
which approved the lirst five 
points of the Rappaport Resolu-
tion with an added unders tand ing 
that legal avenues would be ex-
plored to accomodate any 
problems. An alternate reso-
lution was presented by Walter 
Kohn, Chai rman of the Com mit -
tee Ull Comm!ttpes I 

In discussing his reso lution 
Kohn said: "this universi ty doe~ 
not work in any manner which 
can give a yes or no answer. " 
"I am very aware that we may 
not have a third college at all ' 
said Kohn, later qualifying that 
however, we do want one. 

Davis replied: "We did not 
ask for any yes or no answers 
to particular d mands ... ' but 
we as ked for you "to come Cor-
ward and give us the necessary 
assistance . ' "It 's important 
at this point that we s top bick-
ering with each oth r and s it 
down .. Jo get something done.' 
Davis then read the BSC/ MA YA 

At this point three BSC menr-
bers burst into the Auditorium. 
One exclaimed: "you're jiving' , 
why don't you get down to busi-
ness. " Azzun Davis then ex-
plained to the Senate members 
that such a reaction was due to 
the fact that " we live in a dif-
ferent world than you. Our bro-
thers and sisters are dying in 
the ghettos while you are play-
ing games.' Davis stated that 
what was vital to them was only 
an academic exercise to the fa-
culty. 

At 4:30 pm the eight BSC/ 
MA YA negotiators walked out, 
followed by most of the student 
observers as well as several 
faculty sympathizers. The mood 
of the se~te changed consider-
ably at this po!nt. As Prof. 
Jackson noted, everyone was 
seeking the best way to break 
the deadlock. 

The parliamentarian com-
mented that "rules of order are 
or efficiency of debate, not for 
parliamentary morass, ' and an 
attempt to recess for ten minutes 
was not passed. There was also 
a move on the floor to table 
everything, thus wiping the slate 
clean. 

Finally, Professor Verone, of 
the UCSD Medical School, pre-
sented his resolution, which was 
ultimate ly the one approved by 
the body. After he had intro-
duced this resolution Provost 
Rappaport was called upon 
to make some comments. He 
supported the resolution and in-
dicated that it was "crucial' for 
BSC/ MAYA to accept it. "The 
Third College must undergo a 
radical metamorphasis, which I 
am prepared to participate in, ' 
Rappaport siad. 

He indicated the necess ity of 
having an equal number of stu-
dents and CacuJt y gove rning the 
college and expressed his "sym-
lllthy with minority education." 

Rappaport referred to the ori-
ginal plans for Third College. 
He indicated that these plans 
would have been satisfactory, but 
that they were not historically 
needed. He conceded that a 
college of the type proposed by 
BSC/ MAYA was the type needed 
at this point in history. He 
implied that although he was very 
much interested in seeing LZ 
thrO?gh to completion, he 
reallzed that he might not be 
equipped to be the provost of 
such a college. 

Professor Kirby arose to draw 
attention to "a sense of real 
crisis. " Suggesting that perhaps 
it wa.s already too late, and 
chargmg that the Senate had been 
"Carting around" for much too 
long, he insisted upon the urgency 
of doing something. Prof. Si-
mon concurred with Kirby 
claiming that the Senate was act: 
ing pass ionately and like a bunch 
of children. 

Dean Murphy then announced 
that 50 student were sitt ing in 
the Registrar 's office and called 
upon the senate to give him 
something to go to the students 
with. 

The Veron resolution was then 
passed by a vote of 94 to 5. 
Chairman Munk later remarked 
that he felt the resolution would 
have passed anyway. 

Murphy asked any concerned 
faculty members to walk over 
to the Regis trar's office with him. 
Prof. Saville expressed a des ire 
that the university cou Id be run 
by parliamentary democratic 
procedure rather than "listening 
to insuIty. ' 

As the facu Ity left the meeting, 
this reporter Ironically noted that 
Chairman Munk and several 
others had no idea where the 
Registrar 's off ice was. 

EDITORIAL 

An End of Patience 
No longer content merely to report on Lumumba-Zapata College, 

our paper is compelled to demand its implementation Successful 
establishment requires the support and cooperatlOn of the faculty 
and the administration, but at no time should the ideals of LZC be 
compromised. These ideals include a firm, tangible university com-
mitment to mioority education, as well as meaningful student par-
ticipation in college gove rnment. 

The events of the last week, however, must be closely examined. 
The fundamental question at this point is whether the Academic Se-
nate can begin to think, talk, and write Lumumba-Zapata. 

U has ceased to be a question of confronting minority demands, 
carving them up, and transplanting them into the Third College. 
The Third College Plan, as enlightened as it may have been, must 
submit to the needsof our society. 

Compounding this problem, or rather the result of it, was the par-
liamentary morass created by the Academic Senate. Attempting to 
act like a 150 member committee, the senate displayed a maddening 
amount of confusion. Abody its size must delegate trust and power 
to its committees, and then ratify, with a minimum amount of dis-
cussion, their recommendations. 

It is important that the committee formed under the Vorone reso-
lupivc snJoy this trust, and that its function be one of implementing 
LZC, rather than providing topiCS for general debate. 

Symptomatic of the senate action, as well as of the lack of student 
power, was the seizure of the Registrar's Office. Nothing is quite 
so pathetic, nor as potentially dangerous, as a group of frustrated, 
angry students milling around in the plaza. We saw it after the Re-
gents meeting in November, aM we saw it again last Wednesday. 

Real student power, real participation in college government, would 
go far toward siphoning off such fury. LZC, we suggest, is an attempt 
to build a college structure that wouldn t have to be torn down nor 
even attacked by angry students. 

The action also points out the need for the average student to be-
come informed and concerned; and for concerned students to consider 
carefully their tactics. This editorial has tried to stress how important 
LZC is for every student, and we think that massive, overwhelming 
student support would make the seizure of lJuildings unnecessary. 

As for the action itself, the vote to evacuate the building, reportedly 
29 to 23, demonstrates the protesters lack of unity. While it may 
be argued that it influenced the senate, It cannot be denied that it 
was somewhat haphazard and badly coordinated. It is unfortunate 
that perhaps such an action was necessary to show a lethargic faculty 
that the students meant business. Now, hopefully, rea) communication 
can begin that will allow students and faculty to achieve a solution 
that both can live with.

I had language courses on audlO·v,sual 
equipment at l:C Santa Barbara. but 
the V.B.S. is different. 
It was evident to .me the first day that 
learntng vocabulary this way is more 
interesting and stimulating than most 
people would believe, and I measured 
twelve years' improvement in ten 
weeks . 
I know I have a greater sensitIvity to 
the meaning of words. The surfing 
industry uses Its own vocabulary. and 
specific theories are sometimes hard 
to get across. I find now that with a 
better understandrng of language I 
can re·state ideas If I am not under-
stood at first . 
Since I completed the course my inter-
est in language and reading in part icu-
lar has sharply increased I read every 
night.
