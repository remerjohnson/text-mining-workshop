California’s minimum wage has 
increased from $8 to $9 an hour due 
to a law that passed the state assem-
bly in June 2014. 

California state assemblyman 
Luis Alejo’s bill AB 10 will further 
increase the minimum wage to $10 
an hour in January 2016 and, begin-
ning in 2017, the minimum wage 
will be continue to be modified in 
accordance with the consumer price 
index. 

Proponents of the bill, includ-
ing the National Employment Law 
Project, agree that placing more 
money in the hands of the consumer 
middle class will bring about eco-

nomic growth and stability as a result 
of increased monetary circulation in 
the market. Those who oppose the 
increase, including senior labor eco-
nomic policy analyst James Sherk, 
express concern about the effects 
on business; as a company takes on 
increased expenditures for its labor, 
cuts will have to be made elsewhere, 
potentially in total employment.

“A higher minimum wage helps 
only those workers who actually 
wind up earning that wage and fur-
ther disadvantages lower-income 
workers, who suffer [from] fewer job 
opportunities and working hours,” 
Sherk said in a 2007 report. “Though 
intended to help low-income fami-
lies get ahead, the minimum wage 
instead costs some of their jobs and 
others hours at work. This leaves 
poor families actually worse off.” 

The bill has caused some people 
to cross ideological lines. Wall Street 
Analytics founder and conservative 
libertarian Ron Unz has called the 
bill a relief to taxpayers because it 
incentivizes those receiving public 
goods including welfare and food 
stamps to become taxpayers through 
increased wages. 

“One reason people don’t want 
their taxes to be increased is [that] 
they sense a lot of the money will 
be burned up in the system and will 
never really go to the beneficiaries,” 
Unz said in an interview with The 
Nation. “With the minimum wage, 
the money goes straight to the per-
son who has a paycheck. [Therefore], 
many workers are no longer so poor 
they no longer qualify for anti-pov-

State Minimum Wage Continues to Rise
Governor Jerry Brown signed AB 10, securing incremental increases until 2017.

The University of California Board 
of Regents approved the creation of a 
$250 million venture capital fund 
called UC Ventures, which it will 
invest in startup companies founded 
on campus research.

The fund will be governed by an 
advisory board of outside experts and 
spent on commercializing the UC 
campuses’ most potentially profitable 
discoveries.

UC President Janet Napolitano 
sees the fund as a natural avenue for 
the research already happening on 
campuses.

“In addition to any financial 
benefits, we see this fund as a potential 
vehicle for providing resources to 
support the basic research and talent 
— among both faculty and students 
— required to develop innovations 
that can benefit California and the 
world,” Napolitano said in an online 
post last month.

In documents obtained by the 
UCSD Guardian, one of the new 
programs approved by Napolitano 
will allow the UC system to accept 
a stake in companies founded by 
faculty in exchange for the use of 
university facilities and equipment.  

UC Office of the President 
Assistant Director of Media Relations 
Dianne Klein says that the fund is still 
in its early planning stages.

“We hope those investments will 
pay off — both for the principals 
and for the investors — but there is 
no guarantee,” Klein said. “But keep 
in mind that these are long-term 
investments; they are not envisioned 
as quick profit-taking exercises and 
will not be designed that way.”

Following the announcement of 
UC Ventures, a press release from 
UCOP confirmed that the fund will 
not use tuition or state funding. 

Klein also mentioned that, should 
the fund provide a good return on 
investment, it would not be enough to 
mitigate a potential tuition increase.

“Any one-time payout — such 
as might, theoretically, come from 
cashing out of an investment —  does 
not provide the permanent, ongoing 
source of revenue that tuition does,” 
Klein said. “Those monies are used 
to fund faculty, teaching assistants 
and staff needed to perform our core 
educational mission.”

Klein stated that the cash 
infusions from UC Ventures may 
help the system pay for maintenance 
and equipment needs, as well as other 
costs like faculty recruitment and 
graduate student support.

While the venture fund itself is 
new, the UC system has launched 
hundreds of startups over the years, 
some of which were founded by UC

CAMPUS

Future of  Che Cafe will  
Be Determined in Trial

The Che Cafe Co-operative 
currently faces two legal battles 
against the UC Board of Regents, 
both scheduled for this month. 

The first, a jury trial that will 
take place on Friday, Oct. 10 at 
1:30 p.m., reviews the eviction 
notice that the university placed 
upon the Che Cafe this past 
summer. The second, scheduled 
for Oct. 31, is a preliminary 
injunction. According to Che 
Cafe core member Rene Vera, 
the preliminary injunction 
essentially asks UCSD to 
renegotiate and uphold the 
terms of the Master Space 

Agreement, the lease agreement 
between the all campus Co-ops 
and the university.

During Spring Quarter 
2014, the University Centers 
Advisory Board decided not 
to include repairs to the Che 
Cafe that University Centers 
said were necessary to keep the 
space functional and safe in 
theirits yearly budget. Shortly 
afterward, the Graduate Student 
Association voted to decertify 
the Che Cafe Co-op, citing 
that it did not adhere to the 
Master Space Agreement, pay 
rent or serve the best interest of 

students. 
At the beginning of the 

summer, the Che Cafe Co-op 
filed a lawsuit against the 
university that stated that the 
GSA’s decertification of the 
Che Cafe was unjust because 
the Co-op does adhere to the 
Master Space Agreement and 
that the vote was made without 
informing the Che Cafe or 
allowing for public input. This 
lawsuit led UCSD to place a 
temporary restraining order 
against the Co-op. However, 
according to Vera, the Che Cafe 
Co-op decided to seek new legal

BRIEFS tina  Butoiu  and  Meryl  PressBY
▶ Native American Day:

The Native American Day celebra-
tion at UCSD began on Friday, Oct. 3, 
with a traditional Kumeyaay blessing, 
exhibit tour and reception.

The celebration became an official 
state holiday in 1998 and begins on 
the fourth Friday of every September. 
However, UCSD celebrated later since 
the university’s start date was Oct. 2 
this year.

Originally, the celebration lasted 
only one day, but in recent years, it 
has been extended to a year-long cel-
ebration featuring a variety of events 
throughout the school year, including 
a Native American Film Festival and a 
high school art and essay contest. 

In a statement to the UCSD News 
Center, Chancellor Pradeep Khosla 
discussed how the holiday is an 
opportunity to recognize and celebrate 
Native American history and contri-
butions.

▶ Scripps:
Scientists at the Scripps Institution 

of Oceanography discovered several 
underwater volcanoes during their 
new ocean floor-mapping project. 

The scientists used a new 
approach while they conducted their 
research and created a map which 
contains double the accuracy of the 
previous one. It extracts data from the 
European Space Agnecy’s Cryosat-2 
satellite and captures measurements 
located on the seafloor. The data 
revealed not only seamounts and 
underwater volcanoes located in the 
ocean depths, but also a link between 
the two. Seamounts are once-active 
volcanoes and are found near cur-
rently active tectonic plate bound-
aries. This provides scientists with 
clues about the formation of the con-
tinents. Don Rice, program director 
of the National Science Foundation’s 
Divisions of Ocean Sciences, said in 
a news release that the map will also 
allow scientists to revisit unsolved 
questions that relate to marine life 
and can be used for military opera-
tions.

New Minimun Wage Effect on Campus Jobs Still Unknown

New Venture Capital Fund Will Help Fund UCSD Biology Majors

Next Court Appearance for Che Cafe, UC Regents is Friday Oct. 10.

representation and dropped the suit.
After being served with an 

eviction order later in the summer, 
the Che Cafe Co-op filed the two 
upcoming lawsuits under its new 
attorney Bryan Pease.

“The university actually hired an 
outside firm to evict us,” Vera said. 
“We feel that our position is very just 
and that the university has acted in 
bad faith. Everything they’ve done up 
until now has been trying to remove 
us from the space. They’re spending 
money that could have helped us to 
pay a private law firm. If they really 
wanted to help us, they could.”

Vera also said that early in 
the summer, the Che Cafe Co-op 
presented a settlement to the 
university that involved working with 
professionals throughout the San 

Diego small-business community. 
The suggested changes intended to 
help make the Che Cafe more in line 
with what the Co-op believed the 
university wants the Che to be.

“[The settlement] involved a lot of 
giving up of autonomy on our end,” 
Vera said. “The settlement presented 
a list of small-business professionals 
who would work with the Che to 
get us in as top of shape as we could 
possibly ever get.”

However, according to Vera, the 
university said that it would only 
consider the settlement if the Co-op 
agreed to vacate the space.

“That’s not working with us; that’s 
strong-arming us into a position that 
leaves us without any power,” Vera 
said. “We dropped [the settlement] 
at that point. The university did not 
seem willing to work with us.”

In the meantime, the Che Cafe 

is still operating and has in fact 
expanded its hours, is in the planning 
stages of expanding its menu and has 
begun serving coffee and donuts.

“We just want to stay in our 
space. We’re not asking for too much, 
we believe,” Vera said. “If we are 
decertified, just do it right. If we are 
not working in the best interest of 
students, then we accept that, and we 
want to change that.”

Interview requests for University 
Centers Director Sharon Van 
Bruggen, who was involved with 
the conflict between the Che 
Cafe Co-operative and UCAB last 
spring, were directed to UCSD 
Communications Office media 
contact Christine Clark. Phone 
calls to Clark were not returned.

staff and faculty. Others built on 
research that began on campuses, 
such as Seragon Pharmaceuticals, 
a San Diego-based company that 
was sold to Genentech this year for 
upwards of $1 billion.

A majority of the UC system’s past 
investments were also in the medical 
field, according to statistics compiled 
by the San Diego Union-Tribune. In 

fiscal year 2013, two-thirds of the 
UC system’s startup companies were 
in medical therapeutics, devices and 
other similar arenas.

Almost a quarter of UCSD’s 
undergraduate population majors in 
biology and could stand to benefit from 
an investment from the venture fund.

Requests to both UCOP and 
the Chief Investment Officer of the 
Regents for information on how many 
past startups were, led specifically 

by UC students and graduates, 
went unanswered. At Seragon, one 
member of the Board of Directors 
is an alumnus of UC Berkeley and 
served as a postdoctoral fellow at UC 
San Francisco. 

UC Ventures is set to launch by 
the end of 2015.

erty programs — which makes con-
servatives much happier.”

Many on-campus jobs pay at 
or close to the current minimum 
wage, such as campus food services. 
However, the university has not 

made any statements as to how the 
minimum wage increases will affect 
student compensation. 

P u b l i c  In f o r m at i o n 
Representative for the University’s 
Communications and Public Affairs 
Christine Clark said that the uni-
versity will not yet be able to esti-

mate whether university employers 
will be likely to hire less employees 
or let others go to accommodate the 
wage increase.

Presentations Fill First Council 
Meeting of  Fall Quarter 2014

As Wednesday of Week One came 
to a close, I found myself once again 
climbing the steps to the fourth floor 
of Price Center to attend the A.S. 
Council meeting, although I had 
told myself I would never again. The 
night went as Wednesday nights in 
the Forum usually do: long periods of 
zoning out with 
several cynical 
chuckles along 
the way.

Public 
input from San 
Diego Superior Court judge Richard 
Monroy was altogether unrelated 
to A.S. Council activities, but the 
unconstitutional Q&A session gave 
me solid insight on what to focus 
on if I ever decide to go to law 
school. However, Monroy has close 
relations with both A.S. President 
Robby Boparai and Chancellor 
Khosla and hopes to be an advocate 
for the student voice to Khosla. He 
also deserves props for saying, with 
a complete lack of bias or political 
stance, of course, that he liked the 
back of VP External Allyson Osorio’s 
Fund the UC tee-shirt, which read 
“The Fees are too Damn High.” 
Preach.

Campuswide Senator Joey Giltner 
announced the first collaborative 
project by all the campuswide 
senators, a meet and greet with them 
in the Forum on Oct. 23, which he 
was insistent on reminding Council 
is his birthday. Show up, get informed 
about A.S. Council campuswide 
senators and be sure to wish Giltner 
happy birthday!

Osorio later gave a presentation to 
explain the UC Student Association, 
which included the understatement 
of the night a la Osorio: “Students are 
hard to mobilize on this campus.”

The External Office is involved 
with supporting several ongoing 

campaigns this quarter: Invest in 
Graduation Not Incarceration, 
Transform Education; UConsent; 
Regental Reform and Tuition Increase; 
and Fund the UC. Osorio said that the 
Regents may raise tuition 4 percent 
every year and argue with UCSA 
that our education is “very cheap;” 

however, they 
compare UC prices 
with private school 
prices because 
of the caliber of 
education. When 

caliber became relevant to whether or 
not a fiscally public institution should 
be treated as fiscally public or private 
eludes me.

My faith in the Student Organized 
Voter Access Committee was renewed 
when Executive Director Avril 
Prakash began her presentation with 
a picture of a corgi with an “I Voted” 
sticker on its head.

“This is what we do,” Prakash said. 
“We send cute pictures of people that 
vote, and that is a corgi that voted in 
2011.”

Prakash continued on the theme of 
trying to engage difficult-to-mobilize 
students to explain SOVAC’s mission to 
register and encourage students to vote. 
Prakash assured Council that SOVAC 
stays “hip,” “funky” and “with the 
youth” via icons such as the Legislative 
Llama and Gerrymandering Giraffe. 
Though cute, my vote for which 
marketing tactic to use is with the corgi.

Boparai announced plans for 
a student food pantry open to all 
students below a certain income level. 
Although it is targeted for a certain 
demographic who need the services, 
Boparai said that it will largely be 
based on an honor system and that 
students will be trusted not to abuse 
the pantry. We look forward to writing 
about a productive A.S. Council and 
corgi-filled year!

Last May, the Isla Vista shooting shocked 
the UC Santa Barbara community with its 
speed and senselessness. The fact that the gun-
man, 22-year-old Elliot Rodger, had published a 
140-page manifesto and video blog detailing his 
intent to perform the killings several days prior 
to the tragedy, which left seven people dead, 
made the incident even more disturbing. While 
the shootings and Rodger’s reasons for the 
attack sparked a wide range of debates, includ-
ing a rambling and stonewalled discussion on 
the nature of male privilege, the most impor-
tant detail is how easily he could have been 
stopped. With Gov. Jerry Brown’s signing of AB 
1014 we finally have an appropriate response to 
that infuriating and ultimately tragic situation.

After a series of vetoed gun laws last year, 
Gov. Brown made a comeback with AB 1014. 
Penned by California assemblymembers Das 
Williams and Nancy Skinner and modeled 
after domestic restraining orders, the law gives 
immediate family members the power to seek 
a temporary gun violence restraining order on 
relatives they deem unstable or dangerous to 

themselves or others. Giving that kind of power 
to civilians, most of who probably do not fully 
recognize the signs of mental illness, might 
seem arbitrary. The new law does state that 
falsifying evidence in petitioning a gun violence 
restraining order will be considered a misde-
meanor, but perhaps there is still a danger of 
paranoid relatives reporting only minor suspi-
cions and bogging down the system. On the flip 
side, many might not even report suspicious 
behavior, thus negating the potential of the law 
altogether. Ultimately, we have to hope that 
“judicial discretion” in determining whether 
someone is a danger or not is enough to catch 
the person before he or she has the chance to 
harm others.

Opponents may protest the invasion of pri-
vacy and the fact that the bill appears to put an 
inordinate amount of control in the hands of 
family members to determine the mental state 
of the accused. However, in the most extreme 
cases, as in Isla Vista, the potential benefits of 
this bill and the potential lives it may save far 
outweighs these objections.

In the case of Isla Vista, it is clear that this 
law would have been the force that stopped 
Rodger. The signs were painfully and publicly 
obvious that he was disturbed, yet despite 
repeated warnings from his family and the pub-
licity of his video manifesto, police were still 
unable to confiscate his guns. Movement of the 
bill through state legislature began in February 
of this year, but it faced debate in Sacramento 
and was put on hold during the aftermath of 
the Isla Vista tragedy. If this law had been in 
place then Rodger’s rampage may have been 
prevented, saving the lives of seven students. 

Though this law may seem far away from 
the insulated “safety” of UCSD, gun control 
laws will always hold relevance for us, not just 
as students of the University of California, but 
as members of the California and national com-
munities. It may not be perfect, and it may be 
a few months too late for Isla Vista victims, but 
this law is a step in the right direction for gun 
control in a state with many strict limitations 
already in place. 

Successfully 
Avoid Any 
Potential 
New Friends

As classes kick into high gear, many freshmen and first-year transfer students 
are still scrambling to make all of 
the lifelong friends promised in 
the university brochures and on 
the campus tour. But really, why 
bother? Friends can be expensive, 
annoying and can get in the way of 
the real reason you chose UCSD: 
hardcore, 24/7 studying.

To keep those pesky peers from 
getting into the friend-zone, you’ll 
need to defend yourself from the 
three types of potential friends: 
classmates, suitemates and student-
organization companions.

The last is the easiest type of 
PF to avoid — Just make sure not 
to join any organizations! Student 
organizations are friend traps and, 
this early in the year, social groups 
will be so delighted to have you on 
board, their leadership will employ 
sneaky tactics for acquiring your 
friendship. Be on the lookout for 
people who are overly nice to you 
or ask too many questions about 
your major and college. These 
friend-parasites don’t care about 
your past or study habits; they’re 
only after your friendship. 

If you are somehow coerced 
into joining a group, an unfortu-
nate fate reserved for those caught 
accepting free pizza or tricked into 
filling out a SurveyMonkey with 
their actual email address, make it 
your business to alienate yourself 
from the get-go. If you’ve been 
duped into joining an honor soci-
ety, make sure to complain loudly 
about how education is useless and 
boring. If you’re in an Alternative 
Spring Break organization, make 
sure everyone knows how you’ll 
only stay in five-star hotels with 
fully stocked mini-bars during the 
Guatemala trip. Removing any 
commonalities with your peers will 
save you from any possible friend-
ship.

To repel the unwanted friend-
ship advances of your suitemates, 
never utilize the shower service in 
your suite bathroom. Not shower-
ing will also help keep PFs away 
in discussions and lectures. It is 
important to always keep your door 
closed when you’re in your room. 
Roommates can be very friendly 
and welcoming, so make sure you 
mess with their stuff, stink up the 
room and claim things as your own 
by licking them. In class, make sure 
to raise your hand often and ask if 
the content you’ve been covering 
is relevant to any upcoming exams 
or if there will be opportunities 
for you to personally receive extra 
credit. Asking these questions fre-
quently is expected of students who 
would not like to be bogged down 
with friends and you will have no 
friends to bother you at home or in 
lecture halls in no time.

Follow these steps, and you 
may be so unappealing to those 
around you that you may even see 
your number of Facebook friends 
dwindle and drop as well! You’ll 
be on your way to a friendless Fall 
Quarter in no time.

Next time in How-To-Guru, 
we’ll teach you how to make 
sure you gain more than just the 
Freshman Fifteen this year.

Bills, Bills, Bills

Governor Jerry Brown recently vetoed a bill that would allot $50 million to each of the University of California and California State 
University systems earmarked for facilities. According 
to CBS Sacramento, Brown justified his decision based 
on a shortage in property tax revenues compared to 
budget estimates and the growing costs of this season’s 
many California wildfires. While we recognize that 
California incurred unexpected expenses this past 
summer, it is completely unacceptable that higher 
education should suffer as a consequence.

In response to the loss of this $50 million, UC 
President Janet Napolitano told student reporters 
at a recent press conference that UC tuition will 
likely rise. California legislators — Governor Brown 
in particular — cannot continue cutting funding 
to higher education and turning a blind eye to the 
rising costs of tuition and the privatization of public 
institutions. 

With recent Los Angeles Times polling data 
showing that Brown leads Republican challenger Neel 
Kashkari by a hefty double-digit margin, it seems 
likely that Brown could win the election, leaving 
him and his policies to affect us for the next four 
years. Brown’s election prospects mean than it’s safe 
to assume that “Governor Kashkari” won’t be able to 
save the state’s higher education systems. 

We’re concerned with this latest legislative blow to 
the UC system and worry that Brown may continue 
this detrimental spending scheme during his fourth 
term.

Vetoing AB 1476 was not the first time that Brown 
has chosen not to support higher education. Most 
notably, in 2012, Brown held state university funding 
hostage in order to push his tax plan by threatening 
to cut $6 million from California public education 

AB 1476

Governor Jerry Brown took action last month by signing and vetoing dozens of  bills 
last month.The Guardian took a look at several that will affect UCSD students.

$50M of  Imperative UC Facilities Funding Vetoed

See AB 1476, page 5



unless voters approved Proposition 
30. The proposition — which 
raised sales taxes to 7.5 percent 
and increased income taxes in four 
brackets exceeding $250,000 — 
passed, keeping state funding levels 
high enough to save students from 
immediate and dramatic tuition 
increases. 

Student mobilization for 
Proposition 30 ultimately helped 
the measure pass, but two years 
later, Brown’s true colors toward the 
UC and CSU systems have never 
been clearer. 

The governor was willing to risk 
the affordability of public education 

in 2012 and may have just locked 
in the first tuition hikes for UC 
students since 2010. 

As one of only two voter-
chosen members of the UC Board 
of Regents, the other being Lt. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom, Brown has 
a responsibility to students and 
affiliates of UC campuses to keep 
state education affordable and 
accessible for California residents.

In truth, the funding UC 
schools could have received under 
AB 1476 might not have been 
enough to fend off fee hikes for 
another year. Higher education 
cuts may have been on the horizon 
anyway. 

According to the California 

Budget Project, the sales tax 
portion of Proposition 30 expires 
at the end of 2016 and the personal 
income tax increase expires at 
the end of the 2018 tax year. The 
“safety net” was pretty flimsy to 
begin with, and voters may not play 
into Brown’s hand if and when he 
reintroduces referenda to maintain 
the Proposition 30 taxes in a couple 
of years.

Thus, with deeper troubles for 
the UC system’s books brewing on 
the horizon, we need Brown to be 
on Team UC now more than ever. 
Whether the governor opts to save 
or sink the future of state education 
is likely beyond voter control and is 
solely up to him.

MAKING YOUR DORM INSTAGRAM WORTHY

1. Christmas lights:  White or multicolored, 
lights are always in season! Hanging photos 
from them with clothespins also bumps up 
your trendy status.

2. Post-Its: Use them to create stunning pixel 
art, from Warhols to Super Mario worlds. 
(Post them on your windows for a bit of 
publicity.)

3. Painter’s tape: Decorate any surface with 
line art! It’s also easy to remove at the end 
of the year.

4. Posters: They’re simple, but posters are the 
quintessential piece to any college dorm. 
Enliven those bare walls and declare your 
love for that obscure indie band or My 
Little Pony (and watch out for poster sales 
at the quarterly Vendor Fair.) 

5. Collages: If you’re missing home, print 
photos of your friends, family and familiar 
landmarks for a cozy collage. 

6. Glow stars: You never outgrow them, and if 
you think you have, you’re lying to yourself.

7. Puzzles: Complete a puzzle, tape the pieces 
together and slap it on your wall — visitors 
will think it’s a painting from afar, but 
closer examination will reveal an intricate 
piece of dorm decor.

8. Curtains: Craving a bit more privacy in 
your triple? Curtains are both decorative 
and functional.

9. Maps: Take a map of San Diego, mount it 
by your bed and mark the places you visit 
with thumbtacks or Sharpies.

10. Bulletin boards: Take memorabilia from 
all your adventures at UCSD (ticket stubs, 
photo booth treasures) and pin them to 
a bulletin board. If you want to get fancy, 
dress your board with ribbon, fabric and 
lights.

11. Chalkboards: They’re great for organizing 
your life and adding a bit of schoolhouse 
flair to your room.

12. Themed wall clocks: This may seem 
outdated, but having a Dali analog 
timepiece melting into your wall adds a 
drop of personality to your room. 

13. Bean bag chair: Everyone loves bean bag 
chairs. Get one.

14. Sheets: We all know bed sheets are what 
really make your room. The perfect sheets 
make for the perfect dorm palette. 

15. Don’t be afraid to show off: It’s your room 
— go crazy!

Un Assag-
gino Deli’ 
Estate

The task of recounting all the things that have happened since my last column in May 
in 550 words is virtually impossible. 
So, I’m going to try my best to give 
un assaggino della mia estate (a little 
taste of my summer). 

Starting with June: I packed 
my life into a very heavy suitcase, 
said arrivederci (good-bye) to my 
American life and departed for a 
year abroad in Italy. My program 
was eight weeks of intensive Italian, 
during which I had to: prepare oral 
presentations in Italian, write tesine 
(essays) and take a final oral exam. 
I don’t think I really took the title 
“intensive” seriously prior to the 
program, but it’s definitely titled 
accurately. The program was really 
challenging and not just because Ital-
ian is a ridiculously difficult language 
to learn; it’s the combination of 
school, adjusting to a new environ-
ment and the chronic tiredness that 
comes along with it that makes it so 
hard. Also, during summertime, the 
last thing I wanted to do at the end of 
the day was homework when I could 
go drink a beer with my friends, 
meet Italians and watch the World 
Cup. Before I risk sounding like a 
whiner, just let me say that I am not 
complaining about my summer in 
Florence, as the program helped 
improve my Italian immensely. I’m 
just letting you all know that study 
abroad can be a bit of an emotional 
rollercoaster at times. 

During the month of July, I spent 
time really getting to know Florence. 
At first, it was almost impossible to 
find any Florentines amongst the 
omnipresent sea of tourists, but once 
I crossed the Arno, the river that 
runs through Florence, and spent 
some time in the area on that side, 
otherwise known as the Oltrarno 
zone, I started actually socializing 
with Italians. After that discovery, my 
friends and I took our bottles of wine 
that we filled up at the Enoteca (wine 
bar and dispensary) and headed to 
Piazza Santo Spirito, the city square 
surrounding the Santo Spirito 
church. There, we joined the Italians 
that are always there, drinking on 
the church steps (which is, if you’re 
wondering, both legal and socially 
acceptable, because there are no open 
container laws).

Before I knew it, August rolled 
around, and my courses ended. After 
my program, I had two weeks before 
having to report back to Bologna, 
so two people that I met from the 
Florence program and I bought 
cheap Eurail passes for Slovenia, 
Hungary and Croatia. We traveled 
by train, which meant long travel 
days because the trains in Eastern 
Europe don’t run frequently and are 
considerably outdated. We spent our 
long travel days meeting Europeans, 
who all pretty much had a similar 
itinerary to ours because Eastern 
Europe is much more affordable dur-
ing a prime travel month like August. 
Some trip highlights were: hiking 
for 12 hours in a Slovenian national 
park, soaking in the Szechenyi ther-
mal baths in Budapest and sunbath-
ing on the beaches in Croatia. 

After traveling around to coun-
tries where I couldn’t speak the lan-
guage or use my phone, getting back 
to Bologna felt like home. It’s nice to 
think that after just four months of 
being here, I already associate com-
ing back “home” to being back in 
Italy. Even though it’s harder to travel 
for two weeks at a time since school 
has started, I’m pretty happy staying 
right here, enjoying my new home. 
That’s all for now. Alla prossima 
(until next time)!

Leave all your preconceived 
notions at the theater entrance for 
“Gone Girl” because they are all 
about to be blown out of the water: 
This is not the movie you were 
expecting.

The story is based on that of 
the source novel of the same name 
written by Gillian Flynn, who also 
happens to be the film’s screenwriter. 

Aside from the twisted intrigue, 
Flynn also instills her characters’ 
dialogues with a pleasant cadence, 
although it can feel overly dra-
matic at times. Behind the camera, 
mystery-thriller phenom David 
Fincher (“The Social Network,” “The 
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo”), true 
to form, does not shy away from the 
stylish or the brutally graphic. 

The film offers a personal view 
into the married life of Nick (Ben 
Affleck) and Amy Dunne (Rosa-
mund Pike). Now on their fifth wed-
ding anniversary, Amy is gone, and 
Nick is the most obvious culprit — 
but why would he call in the police 
to search for his wife? He seems 
genuinely worried and befuddled 
by it all.

Soon after, the police are taken 
on a treasure hunt as the whole town 
enters a frenzied panic, brought on 
by the giant media carnival having 
an open season on the “Find Amaz-
ing Amy” campaign — it’s  great 
news fodder, after all. The underly-
ing tension of every scene makes 
for a paranoia-filled procedural jux-
taposed with the romantic journal 
entries of the “gone girl.” As we learn 
more and more about the evolution 
of their love affair, told concurrently 
through flashbacks, the evidence 

begins to pile up against Nick. Nick 
vehemently pleads his innocence, 
but the case turns sour quickly and 
the police are done playing nice. 
By this point, it is insanely difficult 
to play catch-up with the narrative 
because just when one conclusion 
seems certain, a new wrinkle in the 
plot is inserted. There are no givens. 

Fincher’s film has one last grand 
ploy: It hits its climax earlier rather 
than later, feeding the audience 
one juicy twist as present day and 
diary overlap. Life seems strangely 
normal to the still-clamoring news 
world, but it’s not the first time that 
the cameras and reporters fail to see 
reality. It’s funny how two-and-a-
half hours can radically change your 
whole perspective on a seemingly 
everyday marriage. By the end of 
the film, we laugh uneasily in spite 
of ourselves as “Gone Girl” proves 
to be deliciously subversive with its 

pairing of the graphic with the oddly 
amusing. 

This is one of the most intense dra-
mas to have come out in years, and in 
many ways, it simultaneously functions 
as a thriller, a satire of the media and 
even a black comedy. Affleck gives a 
brooding performance as the troubled 
husband, and Pike absolutely blows 
the lid off of her role like never before. 
If she had not already hit the big 
time, she certainly has now. Overall, 
Fincher’s thriller is fidget-inducing, 
spine-tingling and utterly perplex-
ing; there’s absolutely no relief. If that 
tickles your fancy, by all means, have 
at it and find out for yourself what all 
the ambiguity and hype is about. Until 
then, call 1-855-4-AMY-TIPS if you 
have any leads about the “gone girl.”

FILM   REVIEW

Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike star as the trouble married couple Nick and Amy Dunne in this fall’s most 
anticipated film. 

PHOTO COURTESY OF TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX

A new academic year at UCSD 
has begun with good news from 
Housing, Dining and Hospitality: 
Revelle’s dining hall, which underwent 
extensive renovation for a full 
school year, has finally opened. Its 
predecessor, Plaza Cafe, had a bad 
reputation. With this in mind, HDH 
made the decision to rebuild the 
dining hall. This year, Revelle’s new 
eatery opens its doors under the name 
64 Degrees.

The first question you might ask 
is why the dining hall is called 64 

Degrees. 64 Degrees is decorated in 
an ocean style resembling the beaches 
of coastal La Jolla, where the average 
temperature is 64 degrees. The blue 
and yellow interior not only matches 
the colors of the La Jolla waterscape, 
but also the official colors of the 
university, making 64 Degrees a truly 
UCSD location. 

The dining hall has five food 
sections — a sandwich deli, salad 
bar and wok section in the front of 
the restaurant, and a burger lounge 
and “Revelle Cuisine” section in the 
back. With a deli called Vertically 
Crafted Deli, 64 Degrees goes for a 
fancier feel. The sandwiches are bigger 
than those offered at other dining 
halls and are pinned together with a 

pick, which makes them look more 
gourmet. Like the sandwich deli, the 
wok station has a great variety of bases 
(brown rice, white rice or noodles), 
protein components, veggies, sauces 
(ginger, yellow curry, dragon, orange 
chili) and toppers that allow you to 
specially design your own wok dish. 
Many of these dishes are comparable 
to specialties offered at Pines, but 
the ability to choose more than just a 
sauce definitely improves upon them. 
The salad bar completes the frontal 
part of the restaurant with offerings 
similar to salad bars in other on-
campus dining halls. 

“Revelle Cuisine” serves daily 
specials for both vegetarians and 
carnivores. Here they offer mixed 

dishes such as Sauteed Broccolini, 
Eggplant Caponatta and Smoked 
BBQ Baby Back Ribs. If none of the 
above options matches your cravings, 
you can take a chance and try out the 
extremely popular Burger Lounge. 
The punny menu items entice people 
to wait for more than 20 minutes 
for Dogzilla Hot Dogs, WannaBeef 
Oozers (a challah bread burger) and 
Loozer Oozers with milkshakes. 

There may be in intimidating 
variety at each station, so don’t hesitate 
to ask friendly student staff members 
for help. When it comes to paying 
for your meal, the 64 Degrees system 
differs in that each station has its own 
register, which allows you to purchase 
your food and drink right where you 

ordered them. 
The variety of seating is as 

impressive as the variety of food; it 
looks like HDH is compensating for 
last year’s absence of seating near the 
food truck. You are free to choose 
between counter seating, casual 
tables, cozy couches in so-called 
Demonstration Stations with TVs, 
electric fireplaces, coffee tables and 
outdoor patio seating. 

So find a seat and let the pleasant 
atmosphere and gourmet cuisine 
change the way you think about 
campus dining. 64 Degrees sets a 
new standard for UCSD dining halls.

no  one  is  lost 
by stars 
Release Date Oct. 14

Canadian indie-pop band shines at the discotheque with its 
eighth studio album.

ALBUM  REVIEW

“All the kids in the band want you to know that we do love you madly.” It’s 1959, and the swing-bandleader 
Duke Ellington, in his comforting, rich bass 
voice, is addressing his listeners ata Stockholm 
concert.

It’s a strange thing to sample at the beginning 
of a 21st-century rock song infused with the buzz 
of a synthesizer. But 
it’s a quote that Stars 
has embodied for the 
almost 15 years that 
they’ve been on the 
international indie 
scene. Tirelessly re-
warding its fans with 
one full-length album 
after another since in-
ception, the Canadian 
group has proven to 
be both resilient and 
eclectic. Stars’ newest 
offering “No One Is Lost” manages to stay fresh 
and modern with its electronica sound, but also 
paradoxically waxes nostalgic with both upbeat 
’70s dance music and melancholic baroque pop, 
like that of the critically acclaimed 2004 album 
“Set Yourself On Fire.”

Beyond this well-crafted mix of genres, 
what truly gives Stars its signature sparkle is the 
hushed, soft-spoken vocals of lead singers Amy 
Millan and Torquil Campbell, both veterans of 
renowned indie ensemble Broken Social Scene. 
With gentle wisdom tucked into their lyrics 
and singing, Millan and Campbell’s duets have 
proven that pop music doesn’t have to be loud 
or bombastic; vocals don’t have to compete with 
instrumentals.

Yet on the surface, “No One Is Lost” seems to 
be the exception to their usual lyrical style as an 
album that lacks some of the narrative quality in 
Millan and Campbell’s vocal and writing talents 
that had made “Set Yourself On Fire” so poignant. 
Perhaps that can be owed to the overproduc-
tion of many of the tracks — lyricism appears to 
give way to heady beats that yearn to burst their 

way out of the coffeehouse 
and into the club. “From 
the Night,” the lead single, 
encapsulates this issue; with 
repetitive lines and sonic ex-
trovertedness that stretch for 
almost seven minutes, it’s easy 
to overlook its poetry.

But upon careful examina-
tion, one can find that Stars 
is just doing what its always 
done: capture a whole story 
in a few minutes — a story 
that can be interpreted in 

numerous ways. “From the Night,” for example, 
can be about heartbreak or the apocalypse (or 
even both). Lyricism aside, Stars does make new 
strides sonically, creating irresistibly catchy tunes 
with addicting guitar and bass riffs on tracks like 
“Trap Door” and “This Is The Last Time.” But it’s 
the airy, whimsical lyrics perfectly complemented 
with the acoustic rock sounds on “Turn It Up” 
that serve as the band’s implicit love letter to the 
fans who came to adore Stars’ literate, irrepress-
ible nature. It’s no surprise that the introduction 
of that track was Ellington himself, along with 
his fitting quote.

PHANTOM 
by  madi  diaz
Release Date Sept. 30

Singer-songwriter’s electronica crossover makes for the 
year’s most delightful (and catchiest) surprise. 

ALBUM  REVIEW

There are only two kinds of people in this world: those who listen to sad mu-sic to match their mood and those who 
cheer themselves up with upbeat, happy songs 
when they’re down in the dumps. Madi Diaz 
seems set on writing for the latter.

After dropping out of Berklee College of 
Music to jumpstart her music career, Diaz took 
the path of the usual 
indie artist of jumping 
from New York to Nash-
ville to Los Angeles. 
Armed with her guitar 
and folksy tunes, it’s no 
surprise that she found 
herself touring with 
artists like The Civil 
Wars and Landon Pigg. 
But now that she’s been 
on the scene for seven 
years, Diaz has shaken 
off her acoustic roots in 
favor of forward-looking electronica, replete 
with earworm-inducing rhythms of resound-
ing beats.

And so comes “Phantom,” Diaz’s fourth 
full-length album that chronicles a story of 
infatuation crumbling into a messy breakup. 
It’s a weepy topic that could have made a whole 
record full of wallowing ballads, but somehow, 
the emotional tale perfectly complements every 
cheerful song on the album. Setting the mood 
for “Phantom” is the first track “Tomorrow,” in 
which Diaz showcases her charismatic vocals 
which are married to a fresh, danceable melody. 
The album’s latest single “Stay Together” 
continues this trend, mixing melancholy and 
heartbreak with sonically-captured optimism 

and hope. Though there are no acoustic instru-
ments within earshot, Diaz’s background in the 
singer-songwriter genre is apparent here: She 
proudly shows off her stunning vocal range, and 
her voice is looped and layered until it becomes 
an instrument in itself. In short, it’s indie pop at 
its very best.

A few tracks that don’t keep with this 
happy-go-lucky tone, 
however, still manage to 
be crowd-pleasers that 
can satisfy any mood. 
“Ghost Rider,” a portrayal 
of pure anguish accented 
by a foreboding piano 
and harsh synths, is one 
decidedly darker and 
edgier compared to the 
rest of the album. “Mess” 
also breaks the mold, full 
of burning rage sup-
ported by tough-as-nails 

beats. Ranting about a cheating former lover, 
Diaz delivers a fabulously passionate belt in the 
chorus as she sings, “You’re gone/ I’m drink-
ing ‘cause I lost my keys/ I’m broke, locked 
out of my house/ Can you please stop calling 
my phone and playing with me?” Anger never 
sounded so fun.

But the album’s big winner is undoubtedly 
“Dancing in the Dark.” Its infusion of ‘80s 
dance music and a harmonic synthesizer begs 
for a dozen or more replays. And the best part? 
You’ll want to, and you’ll probably even find 
yourself doing exactly as the track’s title says.

TEDI Tritions for Equity Diversity 
and Inclusion
Consciousness of the world around us is an 
invaluable skill for whatever career we pursue. The 
goals of TEDI are to develop students' critical 
consciousness of social justice and equity minded 
leadership, and to build a network of inclusive, 
equity minded student leaders on campus. The 
program consists of a retreat, with four follow-up 
programs, workshops, or events selected by the 
participant to supplement learning. TEDI is 
co-presented by UCSD Associated Students and 
the Center for Student Involvement, and is open to 
all UCSD students.

After recording five assists and 
no goals throughout all of last 
season, Bauman has emerged in the 
new year as the Tritons’ undisputed 
offensive leader. Through only 11 
games, the senior midfielder has 
already notched four goals and six 
assists and is tied for fourth in the 
CCAA for points. 

“He does such a great job cover-
ing so much ground for us,” Pascale 
said. “He’s getting some big goals.”

With the pair of victories, the Tri-
tons have now recorded five shutouts 
in all five of their last wins and are 
tied at third in the CCAA standings. 
They trail Humboldt State and Cal 
Poly Pomona, who are both a perfect 
4–0 in league play. 

UCSD will now return home to 
host Cal State Stanislaus on Friday, 
Oct. 10 and Cal State East Bay on 
Sunday, Oct. 12. Kickoff at Triton 
Soccer Stadium will be at 7 p.m. for 

Friday’s match and 2:30 p.m. for 
Sunday’s match.

Club Soccer Falls in Aztec Cup Final 
UCSD suffers fatigue in fourth game of Aztec Cup, loses 2–0 to San Diego State. 

The UCSD men’s club soccer 
team opened the Aztec Cup on Sept. 
27 against a talented UC Berkeley 
team, who had defeated the Tritons 
in the first game of the regional play-
offs last season. During this opening 
match, Berkeley had the majority of 
the ball possession. However, strong 
organization from the UCSD defen-
sive line combined with spectacular 
saves from sophomore keeper Jared 
Hemann resulted in a scoreless draw.

In its second game of the Aztec 
Cup schedule, the Tritons improved 
their play against UCLA, consis-
tently pressuring the Bruins and 
maintaining ball possession for the 
majority of the match. Sophomore 

Joel Witt opened the scoring early 
in the game with a half-volley fin-
ish from a long-ball assist via junior 
Jonathan Salmeron. Senior Tsuk 
Haroush added to the score when 
he forced an error on a backward 
pass to the UCLA goalkeeper. With 
the 2–0 victory, UCSD advanced to 
the semifinals to play Weber State 
University.  

Unintimidated by Weber’s colos-
sal center backs, the Tritons came 
out strong from the beginning. 
Weber notched an early goal from 
a set piece played to the back post. 
However, Haroush answered the 
Weber goal with a fantastic free kick 
to tie the game. 

The score remained 1–1 at the 
conclusion of regulation time, forc-

ing the match into penalty kicks. On 
Weber’s seventh free kick, Hemann 
received a yellow card for harass-
ing the kicker. Despite the penalty, 
Hemann proceeded to block Weber’s 
shot and win the game for UCSD.

The monumental win against 
Weber put UCSD in the finals 
against San Diego State. However, 
the fatigue accumulated from 240 
minutes of prior gameplay wore 
down the Tritons, who ultimately 
fell 2–0 in the final match.

UCSD will next host Cal State 
Northridge on Saturday, Oct. 11. 
Kickoff is at noon at Warren Field 
East.

Perfect Weekend Against CCAA Foes
MEN'S  SOCCER 

The Tritons recorded two more shutout wins against CSUSB and Chico State.

WOMEN'S  SOCCER

Tritons Upset CSUSB Before Tying Against Chico
Soccer gives No. 8 Cal State San Bernardino its first loss of the season, but fails to capitalize against the Wildcats.

BY  brandon  yu  sports editor
Last week, the UCSD men’s 

soccer team continued its season of 
strong play, winning 4–0 at home 
against Cal State San Bernardino on 
Friday and narrowly edging Chico 
State on the road 1–0 on Sunday. The 
two victories, both against Califor-
nia Collegiate Athletic Association 
teams, puts the Tritons at 8–3 overall 
and 3–1 in the CCAA. 

On Friday afternoon, UCSD put 
on a show for the packed stands of 
Triton Soccer Stadium, dominating 
the Coyotes offensively and stifling 
their few scoring opportunities. 

Senior outside back Matthew 
McClure opened up the scoring 
early, connecting on senior mid-
fielder Brandon Bauman’s free kick in 
the ninth minute of the match. Just 
before the closing of the first half, 
sophomore midfielder Riley Harbour 
headed another Triton free kick to 
give UCSD a 2–0 advantage. 

The Tritons maintained control of 
the match in the second frame, with 
another pair of goals notched from 
freshman midfielders Sean Pleskow 
(74’) and Eric Young (80’). 

Firing a total of 14 shots while al-
lowing the Coyotes only three shots, 
UCSD appeared to have an incred-
ibly well-rounded performance. 
Five of the shots came from senior 
forward and playmaker Alessandro 
Canale. Bauman would finish with 
two assists, while the first three goals 
served as the first-ever collegiate 
scores for their respective kickers. 

“We definitely won the battle 

of the set pieces,” Bauman told the 
UCSD Guardian. “All of our goals 
came off either free kicks or what 
started from throw-ins.” 

Following the shutout, the Tritons 
traveled to Chico, where Bauman 
notched another heroic performance, 
scoring the match’s lone goal in the 
85th minute of play. 

UCSD and Chico State have a 
history of hard-fought games, and 
Sunday was no different. 

“It was a typical UCSD/Chico 
game,” UCSD head coach Jon Pascale 
said. “It was a real battle and grind. 
Neither team gave away a whole lot.” 

Both squads allowed little leeway 
in the first half, with the Tritons 
recording three shots to the Wildcats’ 
two. Chico came out strong in the 
second half and appeared to domi-
nate the tempo of the game with the 
help of multiple UCSD fouls. 

“I thought Chico had a spell early 
in the second half,” Pascale said. 
“They had some momentum going. 
Our guys weathered it well and kind 
of turned the tables toward the end 
of the game.” 

The Tritons eventually took hold 
of the match toward the latter half 
of the second period, and with little 
time remaining, Bauman finally 
broke the scoreless tie. Bauman 
intercepted an attempted Wildcat 
clearance and fired the ball into the 
upper left corner for what would be 
the game-winner. 

Last week, the UCSD women’s 
soccer team recorded a clutch 1–0 
home win against No. 8 Cal State 
San Bernardino before falling in a 
1–1 tie with Chico State. With the 
win and draw, the women’s soccer 
team moves to 4–4–1 on the 2014 
season and 1–2–1 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association play.  

“I think we’re starting to turn 
the corner,” head coach Brian 
McManus told the UCSD Athletics 
Department. “We’re attacking teams 
much, much better, creating more 
chances and just looking more solid 
overall. Today’s goal came on a set 
piece, where we’ve been pretty good 
all year, and teams are not threaten-
ing much in the run of play now.”

Last Friday night, the Tritons 
handed Cal State San Bernardino 
its first loss of the season with a late 
second-half goal from senior mid-
fielder Cassie Callahan. While the 
game was scoreless through nearly 
80 minutes, the two teams fielded 
an especially competitive and physi-
cal match with both squads drawing 
yellow cards. The officials, how-
ever, seemed keen on allowing the 
women to play through question-
able exchanges as players collided 
throughout the gritty matchup.

Junior goalie Kelcie Brodsky 
blocked four Coyote shots in the 
evening, shutting No. 8 Cal State 
San Bernardino down entirely. The 
Triton defense kept the ball on the 

opposite end of the field for the ma-
jority of the game and denied Coy-
ote standouts, including fullback 
Jasmine Williams and defender 
Jillian Seminara, key opportunities 
throughout the contest.

Senior midfielder Cassie Calla-
han scored the deciding goal late off 
a corner kick executed by freshman 
midfielder Jordyn McNutt. Callahan 
managed to win the ball in a close-
quarters contest and sent it high 
into the net above Coyote goalie 
Emily Whyte. Down by one, Cal 
State San Bernardino tried to break 
out offensively, but they appeared 
visibly tired as the Triton squad 
continued to undermine efforts on 
the home side of the field.

 On Sunday, the Tritons faced 
Chico State on the road and came 
up with a draw. Senior midfielder 
Kiley Leshin passed to freshman 
Katie O’Laughlin for the first goal of 
the game in the 14th minute. Chico 
State returned the goal in the 67th 
minute as Halima Abdelshife scored 
her first goal of the 2014 season off 
a successful corner kick.

 Senior midfielder Kylie Hill, 
sophomore midfielder Meghan 
Berry and McNutt all managed to 
get shots off in the first overtime 
period, but each of their attempts 
failed to cross the goal line. The 
second overtime period produced 
much of the same with two shots 
total on the goal — one high and 
one blocked.

 Brodsky managed two saves 

throughout the match against Chico 
while the offense produced 13 shots 
in the game.

“This is a game where we lost 
two points,” McManus said. “We 
had far and away enough chances 
to win it but just couldn’t put some 
great opportunities away.”

The Tritons’ next pair of games 

is at home on Homecoming 
weekend. UCSD faces 2013 CCAA 
champions Cal State Stanislaus on 
Friday, Oct. 10 at 4:30 p.m. and Cal 
State East Bay on Sunday, Oct. 12 
at noon.
