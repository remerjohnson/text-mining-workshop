Muir senator Greg MacCrone could receive punishment 
rangingJrom yerOOI reprimand to expulsion. 

AS senator found 
guilty of assault 
By MATTHEW LAlT, Associate News Editor 

Last Monday night the Muir College judiciary Board found AS 
Senior Senator Greg MacCrone guilty of physicaUy assaulting 
Montgomery Kroopin, of the New Indicator Collectiye , during the 
May 28 meeting of the Associated Students Council. 

MacCrone was found to have violated Section 7 of the 
Student Conduct Code when he pushed down and struck 
Kroopin after a "heated argument." Section 7 prohibits "physical 
abuse , threats of violence, or conduct that threatens the heakh 
of any person on University property or in connection with 
University functions." 

Prior to the altercation , both MacCrone and Kroopin agreed 
that they had had an anlagonistic relationship , which 
developed over their views on the alternative media on campus. 

"I'm pleased that the Studenr Council found that this type of 
behavior is a violation of the Conduct Code," Kroopin said. 

MacCrone was less pl"ased with the outcome. "I understand 
how the Muir Judiciaty Board came to its decision and I wiu 
accept it, however I am disappointed that they found me guilty. 
I definately believe that I was provoked both verbally and 
physically," MacCrone said. 

Kroopin said, "He's not fit to be a public official. He should 
be prohibited from any extracurricular activities concerning 
Sludent governmenr." 

MacCrone, who is on the Judicial Board, said, "I look forward 
to the penalty part of the decision as perhaps the area where I 
will be vindicated. 

"I don't anticipate the Muir College Council removing me 
from their councilor the AS council removing me from their 
counciL" 

Kroopin also has filed a civil suit against MacCrone , the 
Associated Students, UCSD and the UC Regents. 

"I feel the chances of winning (the suit) are very good ," 
Kroopin said. . 

MacCrone 'said he has been advised not to comment on the 
suit. ~

Financial aid 
Continued from page 1 
is long, confusins, and at the 
moment used only by those 
students seeking the grants, 
loans, and work study or a FAF 
or simpler, mini-SMC Financial 
Aid Form to gather the pertinent 
information for the "financial 
need" test for the GSLs or Peli 
Grants only, Rutter said . 

"The basic premise for all 
need-based financial aid 
programs is that the student and 
his or her family, to the extent 
they can contribute, have the 
primary responsibility for 
financing the cost of the 
student's education. Families will 
be expected to utilize their 
resources and make higher 
education a family finanCial 
priority. Students will also be 
expected to make their own 
substantial contribution ," 
according to the financial aid 
handbook 

deemed "(jnanciaDy 
independent" receive more 
financial aid because they do not 
receive a significant parental 
contribution and consequently 
have a higher need. 

The old federal definition of 
independence simply states that 
you must not have "lived with 
either parent or guardian for 

more than six weeks, have not 
and WIll not receive financial 
assistance exceeding $750 
annuaUy from either parent, and 
have not been claimed and wiD 
not be claimed as an income laX 
exemption by anyone other than 
yourself or your spouse for 1985 
and 1986," according to the 
handbook. 

The new bill defines the 
"independent student" as any 
student who "is twenty-four years 
of age or older: If the student is 
not at least twenty-four years of 
age, in order to be considered 
financiaUy independent, he or 
she must be "an orphan or ward 
of the court," veteran of the U.S. 
Armed Forces, a graduate or 
professional student not claimed 
on his or her parents' income 
tax, a married student not 
claimed on his parents' income 
tax returns, an individual "has 
legal dependents other than a 
spouse: or is a single 
undergraduate student with no 
dependents who was not 
claimed on parents' income tax 

forms , and "demonstrates to the

need analysis computations 
based on additional knowledge 
about the financial status of 
students which they might have. 
This includes not only aUowing a 
more liberal financial aid 
package for some students, but 
also the ability to restrict aid for 
students who have additional 
sources of suppOrt not apparent 
in the analysis." 

There will be bad news for 
some students but good news for 
others in the financial aid 
changes. Financial aid programs 
have finaDy been increased to 
accomodate inflation and the 
student's rising cost of living. 
Starting FaD , the maximum Pell 
~ Grant awards will increase from 

the current $2,100 to $2,300. In 
the future , PeD Grants will

Grants will be "limited to five

By CHERYl CARTWRIGHT 
In the first installment oj this 

article, in last Monday's issue of the 
Guardian, it should haye read: 

Simonton cites the awani-
winning GOICM advertisement with 
a woman )lat on her bach with 
seyeral men aver her with their 
fingers Jorming guns as another 
example oj the accepted 
commercialized culture of rape. A 
Jormer model, Simonton was gang 
raped in New York City in 1971 

but was told when she went to the 
police station that a witness was 
needed. When a friend was recentlY 
raped in Santa Cruz and went to 
the police station, she was required 
to haye "collaborating evidence" or 
blood, semen or hair on her body. 
Simonton suggests that perhaps in 
some respects much has not 
changed in the treatment of the 
rape victim since her rape in 1971. 

The Guardtan regrets this error. 

Robert Prentky, a clinical 
psychologist and director of 
research at the Massachusetts 
Treatment Center for sexually 
dangerous criminals, and Ann 
Burgess, professor at the 
University of Pennsylvania, have 
identified "four major types of 
rapists' and sorted out the 
"psychological underpinnings of 
rapists." described in a May 1985 
New York Times article. 

"There are different motives 
that drive men to rape ," the 
report states. About half of the 
rapists are "exploitive - men for 
whom rape is an impulsive , 
predatory act. This kind of rapist 
sees his victim furely as an 
object for sexua gratification , 
and the rape is a spur-of-the-
moment event, often growing out 
of a social situation such as

Student paupers lfTTfHSlHlfHSlfTTfASlfTTfAslfnmslfHfHsl 
Another useful ludicrousity of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-

targeting has just fallen upon us . Congress has passed a federal 
law that restructures the entire financial aid . All new 
applications have been put on hold for one week, while the UC 
administration attempts to figure out what the complex new 
rules mean. This time period can also be viewed as an all too 
short grace period for students dependent on these loans to do 
the same, and restructure their academic careers accordingly. 

The new program represents an attempt to gauge student aid 
to the volatile sums of the economy for the first time in many 
years. Ironically, the Federal Government has pledged to 
increase the availability individual student loans without 
increasing the total amount of money to be lent out. In other 
words, the new program is designed to loan more money to 
fewer people . This is to be carried out through more stringent 
regulations as to who is eligible to receive these loans. In order 
for this budget balancing scheme to work, a large number of 
students must be either discouraged from applying, or rejected 
in their application for these loans . T.he administration's ideal 
is to limit these loans to those who are "truly needy," the 
implicit belief being that many students who already receive 
these loans are not "truly needy." 

Unfortunately, this program of financial intimidation will 
probably prove somewhat successful in keeping lower middle 
class and potential students from large families out of college. 
The new rules have already begun to bewilder matriculated 
students, and will no doubt scare many away from applying to 
college, which will now signify to some a four year span of 
virtual poverty and future indebmess to private banks. The new 
guidelines for receiving the higher interest loans (8 to 12%) 
include a new definition of independent students , as either 
those who are of 24, with an annual income of $4,000 over the 
last two years , or for those students under 24 who can prove 
their true destitution. All students applying will be required to 
fill out a form judging their need of the loan, regardless of their 
parent's income. The Grandfather Clause has also been 
eliminated, so that students already determined needy must 
continue to prove th~ir need . .other pillsing regulations include 
a requirement to cemfy selectlve services membershIp and 
continual responsibility to the IRS. Additionally , the University 
will be required to have a drug abuse prevention program (more 
meaning less hype) on campus in order for these loans to be 
granted . 

In theory, these new guidelines will allow educational 
Institutions to continue to aid those truly in need while forcing 
those who did not vote for mamouth defense spending to go it 
alone without federal pampering. In reality, many students will 
be forced to either drop out, or seek loans from privately 
owned banks at a higher interest and with an entirely different 
set of qualificanon guidlines. With fewer regulations to protect 
them, career decisions of high Importance are going to have to 
be made at a very young age. 

Ronald Reagan's statement a few years ago that education 
should be a privilege and not a right seems to be being put into 
effect. If this administration 's goal is to make college education 
a much more difficult and finanCially discriminated vocation , 
then a splendid job is being done. ~ 

The real Rose 
Editor: 

In response to Christopher M. 
Schnaubclt's letter published m 
the Guardian (October 20, 1986), 
I would like to put his criticisms 
of Chief Justice Rose Bird and 
the California Supreme Court in 
proper perspective . 

First , Rose Bird is not the first 
person to be appointed to a high 
court without prior judicial 
experience. A notable example 
among many others is Earl 
Warren, the 14th Chief Justice of 
the United States Supreme Court. 
In fact , nearly half of the Justices 
of the United States Supreme 
Court had not been judges prior 
to their appointments. 

Secondly, it is nO[ a direct 
responsibility of the Justices of 
the Supreme Court to exercise 
the "will of the people ." It is their 
responSIbility to make 
judgements in accordance with 
the law and the Constitution , 
without regard to the popularity 
of an issue or to personal gain 
for th emse1ves or an yo ne else . 
The Supreme Court should be 
subject to external innuence only 
in that it is duty bound to 
uphold the laws instituted by the 
public and its elected 
representatives, proVided such 
laws are constitutional. 

None of the murderers who 
Mr. Schnaubelt refers to as "alive 
and well" have been released as 
a result of the reversal of their 
convictions. On the contrary, all 
are either serving sentence in 
prison or are awaiting retrial. In 
either case, the minimum 
possible sentence which each of 
these defendants will receive is 
life impnsonment without the 
possibility of parole . 

Schnaube It also parrots the 
war cry of the anti- Bird 
politicians which wrongly 
accuses the "Bird Coun" of being 
soft on crime. In 1983-84, out of 
59,000 felony convictions in 
California, 991 were appealed to 
the State Supreme Court. The 
Court refused to hear 903 . Of the 
88 cases which the Court did 
hear, only 20 decisions were 

reversed due to incorrect 
application of the law by the 
lower courts. The reversals 
account for only 2% of the cases 
appealed . In the O[her 98%, the 
Supreme Court let the 
convictions stand. In every one 
of the 20 cases in which the 

convic~ions were reversed, 
retrials were ordered. None of 
the defendants were re leased. 
These statistics we re supplied by: 
California Bureau of Criminal 
Statistics; California Department 
of Co rreClions, O ffender 
Informanon Services Bra nc h; U.S. 
Department of Justice , Bureau of 
Justice Statistics. 

In addition, it should be noted 
that the California Supreme 
Court under Chief Justice Donal 
Wright, an appOintee of 
Governor Ronald Reagan, 
reversed 170 death penalty 
se ntences, nearly three times the 
total reversed by the "Bird 
Court ." 

I question Mr. Schnaubelt's 
statement of numbers of public 
officials who publicaUy oppose 
the reconfirmation of certain 
Justices of the Supreme Court . 
He fails to mention how many 
do so to further their own 
personal aims by using the 
emotionally-charged death 
penalty issue to attack a 
scapegoat rather than the actual 
source of crime. 

We need a COUrt tha t will 
protect the rights of aU citizens 
undere the law and the 
Constitution, not only those who 
are affiliated with a popular 
cause. 

1 urge Mr. Schanubclt to 
become better informed as to the 
facts before attemting to 
innuence others. If he had 
attended the AS-sponsored 
debate on the Supreme Court 
retention election issue Meld on-
campus rwo weeks ago, he would 
have been informed of many of 
the objecnons which I have 
raised . If Mr. Schanubelt did in 
fact attend that event , I urge that 
in the future he be less selective 
in his presentation of evidence if 
he expects his audience to be

October 20 i!;sue of the Guardian 
we were once again treated to a 
stale litany of old, regurgitated 
arguments concernmg the re-
election of the Chief Justice of 
California 's Supreme Coun. 
However, Christopher 
Schnaubelt's rhetorical plea for 
the ouster of Rose Bird raised a 
few issues that need be dealt 
with . Prima rily, the ti resome 
whining that Rose Bird "defies 
the will of the people of 
California." Indeed, the majority 
of ci tizens in California are 
opposed to the decisions 
regardi ng capital cases that have 
been handed down by the Bird 
court. However, I submit to you 
- so what? Our methods of 
judicial interpretation are not 
decided by Nielsen ratings 
(thank hea~ns) . Furthermore, it 
is not the duty of our justices to 
be responsive to the whims and 
whiles of the populace (70% of 
whom do not even regularly 
vote!). It is the duty of our 
justices to interpret the 
Consti tution of the United States 
of America and to disa llow any 
legislativ or judicial action 
contrary to it. Period ! 

If the vocal opposition to Rose 
Bird is anything other than 
emotional frustration derived 
from the brutal and heinous 
nature of the crimes involved , 
then why hasn't this opposition 
mounted a substantial effon to 
clarify California's capital 
punishment legislation , an effort 
which Rose Bird herself has 
continually advocated .? 

Included in Schnaubelt's 
emotional degressions were rwo 
silly implications: the first being 
that people who kill in Cali fo rnia 
are alive and well, and the 
second that our Supreme Court 
does not protect victims. The 
fact of the matter is that none of

Our courttoom checks and the leaders will likely carry out their preferences regardless of the wishes of the people. Such 
a situation effectively subdued 
the citizens of the fascist 
countries during World War II 
and exists today in many so-
ca Ued Communist nations. 

If the judiciary is forced to allow 
ltS decisions to be dictated by 
political or corporate interests in 
order to avoid the threat of 
removal , the system of checks 
and balances is eliminated and 
the power is placed solely in the 
hands of the controlling parties. 

By MATT SMILEY 
In the late eighteenth century, 

the men who conceived the 
Declaration of Independence and 
led the American Revolustion 
subsequently d rafted a 

ons titu tion and Bill of Righ ts in 
order to ensure freedom and fair 
treatment of the new country's 
citizens. 

In addition to dictating 
fundame ntal laws and civil 
nghts, the Amencan Const ltution 
outli ned a un ique system of 
governme nt that is at least 
pa rt ially p resent in all free 

nations and noticeably 
nonexistent in repressive 
socie ti es. This system, often 
referred to as the 'checks and 
balances' of government, allows 
offic ials with opposing opinions 
to challenge each other on equal 
ground in order to reach a 
compromise that accomplishes 
the most for both causes wi thout 
causing undue hardship on 
eithe r. The American government 
in its ideal form, therefore , does 
not consist of a group of people 
who agree with each other, but 

rather twO or more groups who 
take opposmg political stands 
but are allowed to be equa lly 
rel2resented . 

'While people may argue that a 
government led by a group of 
men who agree with each other 
will run smoother, they mUSt, in 
exchange, be ready to surrender 
their d ifferences and vest total 
authority in the leaders. They 
must also realize that if the 
leaders and the people do 
develop differences in opinion , 
the democracy no longer exists , 

There is a lot of money being 
spent in hopes that it will soon 
exist In the United States. 

One of the mos t sacred areas 
of our government is out judicial 
system. We expect our 
courtrooms to be free of racial or 
political bias. We expect our 
judges to make their decisions in 
the best interest of the people 
instead of serving a business or a 
currently popular political power. 

For this reason Rose Bird must 
remain . 

A disturbingly expensive effort 
advocating her rernoval had 
every conservative candidate 
loudly proclaiming his 
opposition to Bird and several 
other liberal justices. Many 
moderate and liberal candidates 
fall to defend her for fear of 
being fingered by the Republican

the 59 individuals, whose 
sentences were overturned, arc 
free . California law states that 
any person convicted of first 
degree murder with special 
circumstances in this state will 
either receive a sentence of 
death or life imprisonment 
without parole , These individuals 
may be alive but they are 
certainly not well . Under these 
circumstances we are 
exceptionally well protected from 
these individuals. As for the 
victims , dispensation of the 
offender in any form will not 
correct the wrong done these 
people. This however is cenain: 
remove the concept of judiCial 
independence from our 
consciousness, draw strict 
parallels berween Out justices and 
ou legislators and we will all be 
victims! We shall aU suffer the 
type of substantial limitations 
upon our constitutional freedoms 
that many among us would seek 
to impose (a nd do currently seek 
to impose). 

Therefore, I must urge you to 
dismiss these emotional 
arguments which are deSigned 
for your heart and not your 
mind . Dismiss as well the 
undignified attempts by many of 
our legislators to sway your 
judgement by using distraught 
and understandably vengeance-
minded SUrvIVOrs or victims for 
political gam.

advenising campaign as 
"supporting terrorism and drugs," 
or being "soft on crime ." An 
uninformed populus is in danger 
of being swayed by the media 
blitz without actually knowing 
what Rose Bird stands for or why 
the conservatives are so anxious 
to oust her. 

While it is easy for the public 
to understand and digest a 
SimplistiC, clear-cut Supreme: 
Court ruling, there are 
undoubtedly instances that 
require more comrlex thinking. 
like congressiona budget 
debates, the final decision is 
rarely black or white, but grey. 
To ensure fair and just treatment 
of the case, all the laws must be 
carefully considered and upheld. 

Due to the intricacy of the 
state law, the public may remain 
unaware of the true reasoning 
behind the controversial supreme 
court ruling, trying to interpret it 
in the simplistic manner 
depicted in so many books and 
television programs. Thus, a 
decision, like the overturning of 
a death sentence, may be 
unpopular yet remain righteous 
in the eyes of the law. 

Instead of allowing your vote 
to be caSt by a television 
commercial, it is hoped that you 
will carefully examine aU aspects 
of the Rose Bird controversy. 
Look not only at the death 
penalty decisions , but the rulings 
which prevent businesses and 
wealthy individuals from seni ng 
up their own court rooms. You 
may want to examine Bird's 
philosophy of crime control 
which is akin to kiDing a weed 
at the rOOlS rather than snipping 
off the top. After you are familiar 
with both sides of the issue you 
are qualilled to caS( an informed 
vote in favor or against her 
recall . Regardless of your final 
decision , you wiilthen become a 
check and balance of your own 
accord rather than the pawn of 
an advertising executive. ~

students enrolled in 
undergraduate course stud y 
normally requiring more than 
four years," the newsletter warns. 

The new bill will "increase the 
annual GSL borrOwing limit to 
$2,625 for the first [WO years of 
undergraduate study; and up to 
4 ,000 for the remaining 
undergraduate years and up to 
$7,500 per year for graduate and 
profeSSional students". The 
aggregate GSL loan limits are 
$17,250 for undergraduates and 
up to $54,750 for 
graduate / professional students," 
the newslelter continues. 

The SEOG maximum awards 
will increase from $2,000 to 
$4,000 a year and the minimum 
award reduced from $200 to 
$100. These awards can be given 
to the student "to cover costs not 
applicable to other periods of the 
academic year". 

Twenty-five pereent of work 
study funds, starting January, will 
secure partime student 
employment in private sectOr 
employment programs giving 
students more diverse beneficial 
partime employment pertinent to 
their majors. At present. work 
study jobs do not extend off-

campus to profit-making 
instirurions, with a few 
exceptions such as the non-
profit Salk Institute. However, 
there is almost not enough work 
study to accomodate aU the 
departments at UCSD since there 
is a heavy demand for work 
study funds, and departments 
with little funds may lose some 
of their student workers. 

Although the Congresspersons 
had hoped for an "appropriate 
balance berween grants and 
loans," which they may not have 
realized , the newslener suggeS(s 
that "the new measure clearcy 
does establish a framework to 
allow for future improvements in 
overall grant funding for needy 
students". 

'Under the new law, many, 
many students will still qualify 
for GSLs, in my qUick 
assessment. The program is just 
being tightened," Rutter said. 

Because different changes go 
into effect at different dates, 
students may become more 
confused as they may not know 
if the changes will affect them in 
January of next year, in Fall or 
later, if the changes even affect 
them at all. Because the bill is so 
new, the government, University 
of California, and financial aid 
office will have to interpret and 
set the direction of the new 
bill . ~

Rape 
Continued from page 3 
meeting a woman at a bar or a 
casual date ," the researchers 
determined. 

A quarter of the rapiSts are 
"compensators - men who feel 
ac;utely inadequate, men who are 
obsessed by sexual fantasies. 
They often fantasize that their 
victims will enjoy the experience 
and perhaps even fall in love 
with them ." For 20 percent of 
rapists "rape is an expression of 
displaced anger and rage , and 
sex is just another way to 
humiliate the victim." Usually, 
the victim is associated With the 
"source of cumulative insults, 
ofte n mother or wife ," the article 
continues. The researchers feel 
that the victim's resistance to 
this type of rapist may only 
increase his rage . The final 5 
percent are "sadistic· and sexual 
feelings and aggression are fused 
and their assaults are sometimes 
premeditated. 

The researchers advise , "Once 
the assault starts, struggle and do 
anything possible to escape . This 
requires converting your fear into 
rage and your sense of 
helplessness into nothing less 
than a struggle to live." 

"Anyone who goes through a 

situation so alien to them goes 
through a state of shock which is 
like a post-traumatic, stress 
syndrome like that experienced 
by the Vietnam war veterans: 
Dr. Pat Braden , Staff Psychologist 
at UCSD's Central Psychological 
and Counseling Services said. 

"The rape victim needs to be 
allowed to relive the experience, 
to talk about it in her own terms 
to someone who is empathetiC 
and does not promote guilt," 
Braden said . "The sooner you 
deal with the problem, the better 
for the victim. People cannOt go 
around saying, 'Gee, JUSt forget 
about it and it will go away.' It is 
more than saying, 'Gee, isn't that 
awfuL' Others must share the 
abhorrence. People cannot run 
away from the ugliness of rape ." 
The victim's main emotions are 
shame , guilt, anger and fear. 

Braden also suggests support 
groups for rape victims as there 
is something healing with other 
people who have experienced 
the same thing. Other victims 
know the internal things that the 
rape victim is feeling. 

With date rape , many women 
question, "How could 1 have 
been so wrong about him (date , 
boyfriend, friend)?" And these 
women begin to doubt their 
Judgement. There may be much 
fear and problems with making 
alliances with men in the future

since women are afraid ' of 
making what they perceive as 
the same mistake in judgment, 
she continued. 

In a recent California court 
deciSion, if after a extended time 
of heavy pening a woman says 
"no: and the man continues 
through the sex act, there can be 
no charge of rape because of 
"implied consent." Such cases 
will be even harder to prosecute 
since men will continue to fall 
on the argument "I thought she 
wanted to ." 

"Even if a woman says 'no' 
from the beginning, very often 
men do not believe them 
anyway. Women have no control 
over the situation under the 
'implied consent:' Laurie 
MacKenzie, Coordinator of the 
Center for Women's Studies and 
Services' (CWSS) Rape Crisis 
Center, said . CWSS has a 24-
hour hotline (233-3088), 
community education , and 
hospital and coun 
accompaniment with the rape 
victim. 

"Most importantly, people 
must know that help is available 
and that victims do experience 
rape trauma syndrome. Do not 
be afraid to seek help ," 
MacKenzie encouraged. Date 
rape occurs mainly among 
college students, where the 
average age is between 16- and 
24-years of age, she added . ~

Taking the RISC 
By PAGE MERlCLE 

and loving it! 
R AD-I-CAL Irad-i-kel/ adj: marked by a considerable departure from the 
usual or traditional. 

I -CUNEO /in-klindl ad]: 1) 
haVIng inclination, disposition, 
or tendency. 2) having a leaning 
or slope . 

If you take Webster's 
definitions, put them together 
and apply them to a wild and 
crazy group of party animals, the 
result is a fun bunch of people 
with a tendency toward out of 
the ordinary behavior while on a 
slope. In laymen'S terms the 
result is the Radically Inclined 
Ski Club (RISC) of UCSD. 

This club, made up of skiers 
ranging from the pre~bunny hill 
novice to the double black 
diamond hot dogger, has 
conSistently boasted a 
membership of some 400 
students for the laSt several years, 
all of whom participate in at 
least one of the many trips 
ofTered by RISC each year. 

The club began when UCSD 
was founded 26 years ago. lis 
onginal membership IS 
unknown. Since most of the 
"founding fathers" are 
grandparents by now, and since 
no records have been kept, 
tracking down the early hIStory 
of the RISC is a nearly 

impossible task. 
The name RIS was created 

about eight years ago, according 
to current vice-preSident Alin 
KulikowskI , "and it's too well-
suited to the club to change i 
now!" she said. 

Today, RISC is going st onger 
than ever. orne memb are 
already gearing up f, / fl,e season 
- jogging three ti saw ek 
and using any ex b '1'1 power 
to "think snow." OSI of tHem 
don 't mind rain ere i an 
Diego, because IH know th I it 
means snow in diem 't ar hi s, 
an "tl'I 's tHese people ve 
for .,. well , that an he apres s 
pany. 

According to Vice-president 
Kuhkowski , "The club's primary 
purpose is a so ial one:' and 
therefore lOIS of ofT-the-slope 
activities are provided to 
increase club member 
interaction. 

ThIS quarter alone , RI C has 
already sponsored a 100-foot-
long banana split eating contest 
at FFOG, is suppOrting rwo 
intramural teams, and is 
finalizing plans for a car rally on 
October 24, a broomball 
tournament with UC Riverside 
on ovember 8 , and a pre-ski 
Attitude Adjustment Party at the 
Pub on November 22. This is all 

Mom's blacklIst lor missing a 
family holiday, this trip promises 
to be a great time. The bus(es) 
WIll leave on Wednesday night 
and pull i mo Salt Lake City Just 
in time to put the skis on and 
hit the slopes. Then on Sunday 
night, immediately follOWing a 
fourth exhausting but 
exhilarating day of skiing, the 
buses will leave Salt Lake and 
will pull into Urey parking lot 
around 7 am Monday morning ... 
JUSt in time for those 8 am 
c1assesl Exhausting? Yes! Crazy? 
More than likely! Worth it? You 

surprise that UCSD has won the 
All-Cal trophy six OUt of the last 
seven years. No doubt the 
tradition will continue . 

Other trips planned for the 
year include a shorter trip over 
the long Presidents' Day 
weekend in February. The 
location for this trip has not 
been decided yet, though 
Brianhead, Utah and Lake 
Tahoe, California are being 
seriously considered . The spring 
break trip will take these RISCy 
skiers 10 Jackson Hole, Wyoming 
- the destination resort known 
for its incredible vertical drop of 
over 4000 feet! 

It may appear that RISC is all 
fun and games, but it IS actually 
a very formally run organiza tion 
at its core , complete with a 
constituti on and a governing 
body of 14 people (president , 
vice-president, publicity 
chairperson, and nine staff 
members). 

The club meets on the first 
and third Wednesdays of every 
month in the Rec Gym 
Conferen e Room at 8 pm. If you 
can't make it to the meeting, 
then visit the RISC staff during 
their office hours, Monday 
through Thursday from 10 am to 
2 pm in room 208 of the Student

Kripke's planning to doctor up Congress 
By ERIC CHAZANKIN 

D ANIEL Knpke, the democratic candIdate for the 41 st DIstrict 
CongreSSIOnal Seat, is makmg 
waves both at UCSD Medical 
School and for hIS republican 
opponent Bill Lowery. 

Dr. Knpke, a UCSD professor 
of psychiatry and director of the 
sleep disorders chmc at the VA 
MedICal Center, seems confident 
about his campaIgn, even though 
his opponent ha handily 
defeated challengers in the past. 

A graduate of Harvard and 
Columbia Medical School, Knpke 
came to La Jolla after interning 
in the Bronx to help open the 
VA Hospital. ' 

His particular fIeld IS sleep 
disorders, a subject about which 
he has wrirren many articles and 

continues to perfckm research. 
Kripke talks about his work as 
"applYing basiC bIology to 
medicine m a way that helps 
people." 

Kripke's wife , a public health 
physician , helped to found the 
UCSD Women's clinic and 
continues to work there as well 
as servmg as presrdent of 
PhYSICIans for SOCIal 
ResponslblllY· 

Knpke talks of how San Diego 
and La jolla have changed 
politIcally since his arrival. When 
he first came here the 
ultraconservative John Birch 
Society was a definite presence, 
as was the Ku Klux Klan and its 
leader, Tom Metzger. 

Although the makeup of San 
Diego soclery has changed 

conSIderably since then, Kripke 
still sees this ultraconservative 
legacy as the ause of many 
social ills, and particularly sees 
Lowery at the hean of many of 
them. 

Active for many years in 
various democratIc campaigns, 
Knpke has a few main issues 
he 'd panlcularly like to do 
something about; four of these 
are education , women's rights, 
veteran's rights and the 
envIronment. 

Kripke says that, "This district 
is threatened by the incumbent 
who IS trymg to cut back on 
education ." He charges thaI 
Lowery has opposed finanCial 
aid increases, voted to CUt back 
on student loans and voted to 
cut funding for health research ,

threatening many education-
related jobs. "I don't just talk 
about education ; I've been 
educati ng all of my adult life," 
states Kripke . He also tells how 
Lowery opposed the UCSD 
Supercomputer, which he says 
benefits both the Universiry and 
local industry. 

Women's rights are another 
area where Kri pke strongly 
differs WIth Lowety. He charges, 
and records confirm, that Lowery 
voted against the Equal Rights 
Amendment and that Lowery 
tOok the "extremist position" of 
voti ng against abortions even [0

On the environment, and 
particularly the Issue of growth , 
Knpke states that Lowery is "a 
proponent of growth" who

developers. For his own pan,

growth management. 

Concernmg foreIgn policy 
Kripke says, "My first prionty is 
nuclear arms cont rol." He 
proposes restaning negotiations 
with the U.S.S.R. over a bilateral, 
test ban mutually verifiable treaty, 
which he says could save the 
American public up to $30 
billion a year. 

For a man who is as out of 
touch with his const ituency as 
has been surprisi ngly successful 
at getting elected three times 
over the last six years . Kripke 
attributes this largely to his being 
a "skilled political infighter." , 
Lowery, San Diego City Council 
member and deputy mayor 
before election to congress in 
1980, defeated Democrar Tony 
Brandenburg by a 69 percent to 
29 percent margin in 1982, and 
topped a popular democrilt, Bob 
Simmons, 63 percent to 34 
percent in 1984. 

Kripke may have better luck, 
because of changes in the 
population of the district, 
because of one recent highly 
publicized scandal (along with 
Congressmen Ron Packard and 
Duncan Hunter). jet Air 
Corporation contractor, George 
Straza, has been federally 
indicted on 3 L counts for 
allegedly overcharging the Navy 
$25,000 on defense contracts 
over the past 3 years. Lowery has 
been ci ted in the media, along 
with Hunter and Packard, for 
lobbying for Jet Air even after 
they had already been convicted 
of fraud once before. Kripke 
went funher than the local media 
by charging that Lowery had 
unethically, and possibly illegally, 
stayed at a jet Air-owned 
condominium for 10 days in 
1984, paying under the true 
market value for his time there . 
Kri pke also charges that Lowery 
illegally used campaign 
contributions to pay for his stay. 
Lowery has denied that he broke 
any law. 

In 1980, the 41st district 
contained 526,043 people, of 
which 412,731 were of voti ng 
age. Sixty percent of the 
housholds were families. Today, 
Kripke says that many more 
young singles live here. He 
hopes people will be attracted by 
hi s posi tions on these issues and 
turned off by Lowery's views. 

In recent years, money has 
been a Widely talked-about 
measure of a candidate's 
standing. Kripke says that he has 
raised as of the first week in Octob~r, between $120,000 to • 
$130,000, and has already spent 
most of it. He expects his total to 
be berween $150,000 and 
$200 ,000 by the end of the 
campaign. 

The unsuccessful democratic 
challenger in 1984 raised a total 
of $126,295, the one in 1982 
much less than that. According 
to olTicials, Kri pke should be 
lowery'S most well-financed 
challenger to date. 

A cording to Kripke , most 
money for his campaign has 
come from private donations , 
although some Political Action 
Committee (PAC) contributions 
have been accepted. Lowery 
raised just under $400 ,000 in his 
1982 and again in his 1984 
campaign. 

His ca mpaign has three full-
time paid sraff members and twO 
part-time nes. In addition, there 
are over 500 volunteer and 
others working in his precincr 
organizarion .' In contrast, Kripke 
says, "My opponent has done 
nothing." ~

With the Fall ClaSSic in full bloom, the basebal. 

sarurated aivia conrest has attracted a deloge of entries, 
The most interesting entry submitted was this week's 
winner, Jennifer Scott, who either has a father in 
Cooperstown or has been fed basebaD mVla I 
inuaYel10usly since birth. For example, question 6 
asked, "Who was the second baseman for the 1972 
Oakland A's?" and proceeded to name each of the 
players who were at second during the season and how 
many games each played. (Oal Maxvill?), Some people 
may not know that Reggie Jackson actually played in 
Modesto in 1966.

PE's Mr. Do-it-all 

Call him Skief the Chief 
By LYNNE MCLEVlE 

T HERE he is at 7 am, marking .~he course for a cros -country mte. After 
that , he goes 10 his 
administration meetings and 
paperwork. Next, there are 
classes to teach. The last phase 
of the day is to coach the cross-
COUntry team. Andy Skief spends 
much of his time on campus, 
doing things for students. Skicf 
says, -1 don't think there has 
ever been a time that I've said 
that I'll work my 8-5 then go 
home." 

As Howard Hunt, the former 
chair of the Physical Education 
Depanment explains, Skief has a 
"vital interest in students and is 
willing to spend time with them. 
He goes beyond the call ." 

Skief sees life in a different 
way than most. He points out , 
'Tve been doing this for 18 years 
and it's kind of like perpetual 
mOtion ." When one looks at his 
past and present schedule, this 
view shows again and again. 
After graduating high school in 
LaJnlla , he went to Oregon State 
and played football and 
p;1r :cipated in track and field 
lur lour years. Although he had a 
physical education major, he 
couldn't find a job in the field . 

Being the resourceful person 
that he is, he employed himself 
as a com mercial fisherman and a 
custodian at Scripps for seven 

years. 
One day he was cleaning Urey 

Hall on the UCSD campus, he 
ran into Dr. Ted Forbes who was 
then the Dean of Students. 
Forbes was developing a PhYSical 
Education Department for the 
school. "He knew me because I'm 
a native of La Jolla. He knew that 
1 went to Oregon State and what 
my degree was in and asked me 
if I wanted 10 come and work 
with him ," said Skief. 

LUCKily for UC D, this 
incredible man came to work 
here. But, it 's not just the regular 
administrative work that makes 
Skief so different. It is how much 
he cares for his athletes and 
students. Evidence of this is that 
he does so many extra things for 
them. 

He plots all of the 10K and 
cross-country courses, sometimes 
coming up on Sundays. He goes 
to cross-COUntry meets each 
Saturday. He teaches a ski n 
diving course which takes trips 
to the cove regualarly. He even 
spent last Christmas vacation 
fixing the walls of Canyonview 
weight room after lifters had 
punched many holes in them. 

He explains his Christmas 
break, "I worked throughout the 
Christmas break and repanelled 
the whole area." He is talking 
about spending this Christmas 
break reuph olstering the weight 

room . As 'if that wasn't enough 
work to put into one room he 
suggests , "1 can go in and 1 can 
repair eqUipment, but 1 can't be 
in there conSistently." It sounds 
to ~e like he already IS in there 
an awful lot! Although as the 
physical education supervisor, he 
has responsibility for that weight 
room, it is unusual that he 
himself does the maintenance on 
it. 

Skief is nOl only an unusual 
administrator, he is also an 
unusual coach . He rides his bike 
alongside his cross-country tcam 
as they work out. He says that 
the reason for this is, "just to be 
with them rather than just say, 
'You guys run this course: and 
wait for them to come back." 
Energy and positive feelings just 
ooze from this man. 

This may explain his 
popularity on campus. As 
Yvonne Ellington, a track athlete 
from last year, so aptly PUt it , 
"he's just unbelievcable ." Another 
unbelievable aspect is that he 
has daughters aged 22 and 24. 
But he only looks 30-years old . 
He thinks that his body has had 
"the normal amount of old age 
()trition ." An anonymous woman 
described Skief as "an incredible 
specimen of a man ." No room 
for atrition there. 

The reason Skief is in suc h 
good condition is that he 
chooses certain types of jobs. He 
points Out, "all my life I've been 
involved in sPOrts or some kind 
of work where a lot of physical 
activity is involved: Another 
reason is that he looks for 
activity wherever possiblc . His 
feeling is that "you can do 
physical fitness all through the 
day ... if one wants to take and 
do an easy jog beTWeen classes." 
On the UCSD campus, just 
jogging beTWeen classes is 
enough to keep anyone trim . 

Doug Dannevik has kept the Tritons No. 1 most oj the season. 

Skier must take this atti tude 
towards working out because 
with hi s schedule hc does not 
havc hours to se t a ide. He is 
the assistant athletic directOr, 
track and field coach, cross-
country coach and full -time 
physical education inslrucLOr. 
Above aU th is , h e is a man that 
really cares about this campus 

Still winning at the top 
The women's volleyball team kept their number one in the nation 

ranking in tact by beating Cal State-San Bernardino, and 
daremont-Mudd last week on brief road trip. and its students. ~

As an Armed Forces physiCian you'll receive officer's pay and benefits, and

12 Th~rsday. Ocrober 23. 1986 

(auDUGtn:) 
CRlSWELL WINS 

ANOTHER VB TITI.E! 
II was another all day affair at the 12th 

annual UCSD Volleyball Doubles 
Championships held two weekends ago 
and the result of the Men's Open 
Championship had a familiar ring to it 

Fifth year senior SCOtt Criswell cruised 
to his third consecutive Men 's Open 
crown with panner Jeff Babcock as they 
blitzed a shon and soft field of seven 
teams. Criswell and Babcock. made short 
work of their closest chaUengers, Gordon 
Schiring and Jeff Jamile, with a solid 15-6 
one set ViCtOry in the finals . Criswell-
Babcock had earlier thrashed Schiring-
Jamile in the winner's semis 15-9 and also 
thoroughly roUled the Great Scott team of 
Green-MacGregor 15-4 in the Winner's 
bracket finals . 

For Criswell it capped a marvelous three 
year run , one in which he has totally 
dominated volleyball doubles competition 
on campus. Only Hal Jacobs' four 
consecutive toumament wins back in the 
70s has topped Criswell's outstanding 
record. 

The Men's Intermediate DiVISion 
brought forth some competitive novice 
playas 15 teams battled it Out for the 
championship. 

Greg Carter and Evan Colhns came 
through the loser's bracket to upend the 
team of Pat Burke and Marty Clow, 15-13, 
15-10 in the finals . Burke-Clow had 
blasted Carter-Collins earlier in the 
winner's quarters, but ran out of steam in 
the championship match . 
The 1986 Women's Double Champion-
ship was won by campus live wire Christy 
Wellington and her partner Elena 
Pasquale. Welhngton-Pasquale teamed to 
whip UCSD women's team standouts 
Christy Wada and VIcki Haire 15-8 in the 
finals . 

ALL-CAMPUS TENNIS 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 

SET FOR THIS WEEKEND! 

The annual UCSD All-Campus Tennis 
Championships begin its annual two-day 
sojourn this coming weekend on the Muir 
Courts as some 100 hopefuls compete for 
top tennis honors in a number of 
divisions. 

Individual Sign-ups are still taking place 
at the Canyonview Recreation Offices. 
Entry fees are as minimal as they come. 
One can of new Dunlop or Penn [ennis 
balls does the IriCk. 

Five divisions of play are being offered: 
Men's Open, Men's Intermediate (B), 
Men's NOVIce (C), ',\Iomen's Open, and 

1M FLOOR HOCKEY PREVIEW 
This I California . You know. the b~ach , 
getting a ran, and maybe a httle bit of 
volleyball on the beach Jr\ nor your basi 
horbed of Hockey But you should check 
out the Reckerdome SOme mght. You'd 
think you were in Canada or something. 
Hockey players all over the place . Aye , 
Teke off your hosiers. These dudes and 
dudeses are so into hockey they even have 
been known (0 pass up prime time in the 
'Pub' on Friday's just to practice. 
Strange! 

AAA 
Blitzkrieg has dominated Coed Hockey for 
last couple of years. Led by the Stamey 
brothers of UCSD, Don and Mike Petersen , 
they look to be in the finals again. But thiS 
year they will face some stiff competition 
from the usually tough Capt. Dick. Capt. 
Dick's girls usually carry the load and will 
again this year. Darkhorse threats will 
come from Rent A Clue, even after a big 
upset by The Gulls, and Plopper Fizzed to 
Boston. 

AA 
Sometimes people never learn. Hockey is 
one of those spons where 'sandbagging' IS 
easily sporred . Well , we found you!! The 
twO biggest "sandbaggers" this year are 
Andy McWhirter's High Phi 's and Ira "aU I 
care about is mr picture on the wall" 
Rubenstein's Fina Act. To give youan idea 
of how much better they are than the 
Average "M OO team, get a load of the scores 
of their games: 15-0, 13-0, 9-1 , 8-4. But, 
fret nor all you real "M " teams. The all wise . 
all seeing, ever inSightful Budman sees 
them playing the "AAA" playoffs in his 
crystalk ball. Let's see how they do in 
December. 

A 
This is the diviSIOn where a "AAA" player, 
like the one on the Sammies, or a "M OO 
player, like the one from Brain Damage, 
tries to steal the title from everyone. But we 
all know that one woman/ man does nor 
make.up a whole team. Look for those twO 
teams to make an early exit from the 
playoffs. One of the only legitimate "A" 
teams is Brain Dead, nOl to be confused 
with Bram Damage. These guys and gals 
show up every week. play hard , and get 
crushed by the likes of Sandbagging teams. 
The Budman picks this team to be the "A" 
champions , at least a title in 
sportsmanship .

SPUDS MAC KENZIE'S 
BUD LIGHT TEAM OF THE WEEK 

- DANA DUDETTES -
This paSt week. the DANA DUDETTES PUt on an unbelievable performance, earning 

themselves team of Ihe week honors. This Women's A Volleyball Team is a definite force to be: 
reckoned with . Behind the highly inspirational (and loud) coaching and encouragement of 
Shannon Perry. the gorgeous gals from DANA trounced VITAMIN E 12-15, 16-4, and II - I. 

The MVP of Ihe game had to be Chnsie Lucero, whose awesome serve sparked the 
DUDDETTES' incredible comeback. Her serve is so hard Ihat she sent the opposing team 
members home wllh bruised forearms! 1 

This squad would be a shoe- In for a national championship if they played on an 
Intercollegiate level. Oh well. I guess they 'I1 JUSt have to settle for an 1M championship and , of 
course. a Bud Ught. 

Performing unnatural acts 
"Yams Up My Granny's 

Ass," "Don't Hang the 
Angel," and "I'm an Ass 
Man" are a sampling of the 
titles of Karen Finley's works, 
Finley has gained much 
notoriety as a performance 
artist doing graphic and 
explicit monologues on 
"unspeakable practices" and 
"unnatural acts, II 

Finley attacks the 
controversial subjects of 
incest, rape, loneliness. and 
sexual obsession, among 
others, through verbal and 
physical illustration, Often 
speaking as a man, Finley and 
her work elicit controversy. 
C. Carr of the Village Voice 
says, "On stage, Karen Finley 
represents a frightening and 
rare stage presence - an 
unsocialized woman." 

Finley began her career as a 
painter. In 1979, she began 
performance work while a 
student at the San Francisco 
Art Insti tute. She had 
difficulty doing static work 
while feeling such "active 
emOClon" after her father's 

suicide, Finley says she felt an 
"incredible yearning to get up 
and tell the awful truth in 
front of people, " 

Performance art, although 
seemingly new, has roots in 
turn-of-the-century work, 
"The futurists and the 
Dadaists sought to do 
manifesto kinds of things, 
making statements, doing 
variety theatre and most 
importantly breaking down 
the existing beliefs and the 
serious, solemn aspects of 
art," Larry Baza of Sushi, Inc. 
explained. The Bauhaus 
artists in Germany carried on 
this tradition in the 1920's. 
Performance art came to the 
U_S. in the 1930's; however, 
it was "officially" recognized 
in 1945 with the works of the 
Black Mountain Group in 
North Carolina. This group 
tended toward abstract and 
performance painting, and 
included such luminaries as 
John Cage and Merce 
Cunningham_ 

Alan Caprow, now a 
member of the UCSD Visual 
Arts Department, broke into 

by marla hellman 
the all-too-quiet performance 
art scene with his startling 
"Court Yard" piece in 1962, 
The work was performed in a 
courtyard in Greenwich 
Village, This move was a 
natural one in that many of 
the tumultuous events of the 
1960's were "in the streets," 
Caprow's courtyard piece 
attempted to desanctify art, 
bring it to the people, and 
make it accessible . 

The field broadened in the 
1970's with "interdisciplin-
ary art" which is any piece 
that uses two or more 
disciplines that are nontheat-
rical in equal shares , 
Contemporary performers, as 
they are also called, usually 
come from a visual arts 
background. "No matter what 
t~e name, performance art 
focuses on satisfying an 
artist's immediate need to 
communicate," says Lynn 
Schuette of Sushi, Inc, 

Interestingly, the mass-
marketed film legal Eagles 
featured a performance piece 
by Daryl Hannah, It is ironic 
that even though performance 

art stems from the need to 
make art more accessible , it is 
still almost exclusively 
performed in art circles_ 
Finley said in an LA, Times 
interview, "The art crowds 
are usually too cool to show 
their feelings _ To be a 
performance artist, you need 
the public to complete the 
work_ So I like the clubs," In 
reality, those who frequent 
the clubs are a segment of the 
"art circles," 

As San Diego's cultural 
scene grows, so does the 
diversity of art that is offered, 
Sushi, Inc., where Finley will 
perform, has brought a variety 
of experimental theatre, as 
well as new music and new 
dance, to the area. In its 
seventh season, Sushi 
continues to bring visual art 
shows that focus heavily on 
local artists not usually found 
in commercial galleries, 

The La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art also offers 
a series of performance pieces, 
The Paul Dresher Ensemble 
performed an experimental 
opera entitled "Slow Fire" to 

an apprecllluve audience in 
the Sherwood Auditorium. 
Stuart McClean, the 
performance curator at the 
museum, sees the museum's 
role, due to its large stage, as 
"bringing larger scale, but 
fewer, very special shows to 
San Diego," 

Finley performed to sold-
out audiences this past 
weekend in L.A.'s Lace 
Theatre, Some may find her 
performance distasteful. yet 
Regina Willis of the Boscon 
Gay Communil) News says, 
"If nothing else Finley lets us 
take a good look at ourselves 
and our ridiculous extended 
metaphors pertaining to sex 
and lets us know that we are 
not alone," 

Finley says, "What I .do 
definitely makes people feel 
uncomfortable ." Often one's 
perception is changed when 
one is confronted by 
controversial or "uncomfor-
table" issues. Finley will be 
"talking about taboos" and 
performing at Sushi, Inc.

The Washington Ballet, recognized for their youth and 

energy, start their tenth anniversary season by performing 
at Mandeville Auditorium Thursday, October 30at 8 pm. 
The performance, featuring the works of Choo-San Goh, 
lasts approximately two hours and includes the ballets 
" Double Contrasts," "Time Out," "La Fille Mal 
Gardee," and "Fives," the company's signa ture ballet; all 
are unique to the company. Goh has won numerous 
awards and has gained world-wide recognition. 

While the company does not have a ranking system, 
several dancers will be featured in the UCSD 
performance. Among them are Julie Miles, a founding 
member of the Washington Ballet who has been with the 
company for oyer ten years, and Michael Bjerknes, who 
has performed with the Milwaukee Ballet and the Jaffrey 
Ballet. 

The performance is the first in a two-week California 
tour for the mid-sized company consisting of 22 dancers 
and two apprentices. The company toured Japan earlier in 
the year and Europe during the summer. The company 
performs an average of six tours per season, along with 
many performances around the Washington D.C. and 
B'altimore areas. 

Although the Washington Ballet started in 1976, Mary 
Day, who now serves as artistic director, and Lisa Gardner 
founded a Washington school of dance in 1944 which is 
still in existence. The school was converted into a 
Russian-style academy where academics were taught 
along with dance in the 60's and 70's but it has since been 
changed back to its original form. For more information, 
call 534-4090.

Daw Wakeling and Ranking Rose of General Public. 

Hand fed 
by mark pinkus 

An almost three~year wait 
has proved to be well worth it 
for those who have yearn~d 
for a new General Public 
album. Hand to Mouth, 
released earlier this month, is 
the follow~up album to GP's 
successful 1984 debut album, 
... all the rage, and promises to 
do even better. Ranking 
Roger, the bana's co-leader, 
stated, "This one's musically a 
lot more tight than our first 
album. We're more exper-
ienced and that makes a big 
difference. " 

Dave Wakeling and 
Ranking Roger, ex-members 
of the English Beat, have 
written the music and lyrics 
on all ten tracks and are 
featured on guitar and 
percussion, respectively. So 
much of the music coming out 
of Britain sounds similar, but 
these two have managed to 
come up with an original 
sound that combines rock, 
reggae, ska, and some light 
rhythm and blues. 

Roger hopes their first 
single released from the 
album, "Too Much of 

N~thing," will do what 
"Tenderness" did for their 
first album. He realizes that 
there is a difference between 
the two, which causes him to 
respond happily, "It's less 
commercial and that's the way 
I like it." Being less 
commercial ought to help lure 
back the fans who enjoyed the 
Beat's 1 Just Can't Stop It and 
Special Beat Ser~ice albums, 
without losing the newly-
gained admiration of the 
dance-oriented crowd. 

General Public, not a band 
to miss out on the resurgence 
of the peace movement, 
examines world · unity in its 
six-minute~plus steadied beat 
anthem, "Forward as One." 
Roger comments, "We're not 
putting ourselves in the U2 
category; all we're sayin~ is if 
we all get together, then we 
can probably live for another 
thousand years. If we don't, 
we'll only live for ten." He 
optimistically continues, 
"We're trying to get the 
message across that there is 
hope. We are still here. We 

can do something about it." 
"Come Again," the first 

song on the album, is expected 
to be the next single released. 
Using female back-up singers 
to accompany Roger on 
vocals, the words, Come again. 
rome again. Oh help me through 
tonight. Come again. Come 
again. Second time will be twice 
as nice. Come again. A white 
light at the end of the tunnel. 
Come again, come again, oh 
Jesus Christ, leave the listener 
in confusion as to whether 
this tune is a plea for the 
Messiah, or if its sexual 
undertones are for real. When 
asked about this, Roger 
responded with the question, 
"What's' th#e diiference 
between sex and reiigion?" He 
continued by answering his 
own question, saying "There 
isn't any, really. If you believe 
in them, you get the same 
feeling from both." 

The song which Roger 
would like to see I.R.S. release 
as their next single is "In 
Conversation." A slower~ 
paced song than the rest, this 
is one of the four rela tionship-
related songs that Wakeling 
has written for his wife. On 
the subject of wives, the main 
reason the albl,Ull took so long 
to be released was that both 
band leaders became fathers, 
as did two engineers and co~ 
producer David Leanord. 

With paternity distractions 
out of the way, the band is 
ready to embark on a tour of 
the United States. The tour 
started back East in the 
middle of September, and the 
band will be on the road until 
just before Christmas. The 
last show of the tour, which 
will be either December 19 or 
20, will be played here in San 
Diego. The band will be 
playing in bigger places than 
on their '84-'85 tour, but 
Roger promises, "No places 
where I can't see the back 
wall." 

With a new album, a new 
child, and a new tour getting 
underway, Roger says with a 
laugh, "At the moment, I 
couldn't be more happy." 
Well, Roger, neither auld 
the general public.

cabaret 

UCSD Theatre is excited 
about starting a cabaret. 
Cabaret, to most, involves 
comedy sketches, songs, and 
reviews; which is not 
necessarily true. Cabaret is an 
event and place that gets 
people into the habit of going 
to the theatre. The cabaret 
UCSD is starting is based 
behind the Yale cabaret which 
has blossomed into a major 
event. It's "the thing to do" at 
Yale. And fortunately for 
UCSD, the brilliant man who 
started Yale's tradition is also 
a member of our distinguish, 
ed faculty, Walt Jones, who 
will be producing the shows. 

Jones, a member of the 
directing faculty, is 
responding to a need that 
exists in all campuses; which is 
to have a freer form of theatre. 
It's a very open event for 
anyone who wants to get 
involved, and is not restricted 
just to UCSD students. 

Cabaret doesn't have the 
restrictions that the major 
productions have, since it 
involves many different kinds 
of theatre, ranging from 
performance a rt to the 
eclectic, it creates an informal 
"rawness" or "roughness" to 
it that becomes a new 
experience for the audience. 

The cabarets will usually 
consist of a series of three 
"one*acts" within a 45, 
minute time frame. Eventual, 
ly the Theatre Department 
would like to see it expand to 
three nights, when the core of 
enthusiasm has spread into 
the general campus. The 
cabaret will receive its limited 
resources from the Theatre 
Department for use of 
costumes and hand props. 

The idea behind the cabaret 
is to have fun. The Theatre 
Department is accustomed to 
working on major pieces with 
heavy subject matter so this 
will be a welcome change 
before the season starts. Yet 
it's not a bunch of theatre 
people having a great event; 
anyone can participate in any 
aspect and the audience is an 
important part of this 
alternative form of theatre. 

This is not like amateur 
night because all of the pieces 
are rehearsed. If you have an 
idea for a proposal, submit 
your project to Jan or Ralph 
who are coordinating this at 
534.-6851. Determine how 
long it will be, if it's scripted, 
and the number of people in 
it. 

Opening night is October 
24, and showcases "Tossed 
Salad" by Walt Jones, using 
material others have written, 
including playwright grads 
and his own material. After 
this, there will be different 
cabarets every week on 
Thursday and Friday nights at 
8:00 and 10:30 showings, 
except for Thanksgiving 
week. Performances will be at 
the small studio theatre at 
Warren and one weekend this 
quarter at the Pub.
