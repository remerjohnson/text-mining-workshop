·Waiver deadline 
extended a week 
A.S. Council gets deadline to 
waive health insurance postponed 
By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

The deadline to waive the 
ndergraduate Student Health 

Insurance Plan has been moved to 
Oct. -, tudent Health Services 
officials announced Sept. 25. 

Complaints from the A.S. 
Council that SHS did not ade-
quately inform students about 
US HIP prompted the change. 

The UC Regents passed 
U I liP almost unanimously in 
September 2000 after nearly five 
years of planning. Part of that 
decision included mandatory 
health insurance. 

A.S. Council members fear that 
USlllP and its $163 per quarter fee 
were not given enough publicity. 
The council is concerned that stu-
dents will end up paying for health 
coverage that they do not need. 

Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Kyle Bjebesheimer is 
worried that many students at 
UCSD may not have realized that 
their accounts were billed for health 
coverage because the program' 
publicity was kept to a minimum. 

"They've done a lot of little 
things, but if you're going to make 
a change as important and signifi-
cant as that, you must publicize it," 
Biebesheimer said. 

SHS Director of Administrative 
Services Suzette Tsiknas said that 

enough has done enough to inform 
snldents about the introduction of 
USHIP this fall. SHS ran advertise-
ments in the Guardian, posted 
information on Studentlink and 
sent an infomlation sheet with 
undergraduates' billing statements. 

"We don't want to be opposed 
to A.S., and we've done everything 
we can to get the word out to Slll-
dents," Tsiknas said. 

SHS is also co-sponsoring an 
information booth witll the A.S. 
External on Library Walk. 

Biebesheimer argues that the 
half-page flier, mailed in August, 
did not adequately publicize 
USHIP. He said that the adminis-
tration should have written a for-
mal lener introducing USHlP and 
explaining ways to waive the fee or 
to purchase the school's policy. 

Tsiknas said that a formal letter 
will not be sent because the 
administration thinks it would be 
ineffective and costly. 

"People move around so often, 
it's difficult to know which address 
to send the letter to," Tsiknas said. 
"Also, I don't think tllat they 
would read that any more than 
they read anything clse." 

About 6,100 students had 
waived USHIP as of Sept. 25. SHS 
officials do not know if it is because 
a lot of people need adequate health 
insurance or if they were unaware 
of the approaching deadline.

Vendors exhibit their wares on Library Walk this week 
The quarterly event spawned mixed emotions; some felt nothing new was offered 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The quarterly vendor fair trans-
formed Library Walk into a shop-
per's paradise this week. 

The fair coincided with the 
first week of classes, and traveling 
merchants filled the walk with 

ten ts and booths. 
Vendors lined the western edge 

of UCSD's main walkway from 
Center Hall to Geisel Library. 

Student opinion on the vendor 
fair varied. Some students found the 
vendors' items affordable and myri-
ad, but others thought the mer-
chandise was expensive and limited.

supported the fair. 

"It's pretty good," Lawrence 
said. "They've got some pretty 
good deals here." 

However, Marshall junior 
Andrew Lurker found the vendor 
fair puzzling. 

"Why is everything so expensive 
if it's geared toward students?" 
Lurker said. "I don 't know how some 
people sell stuff at these things." 

Muir junior Lindsay Shafer felt 
a silnilar distaste for the vendor fair 
and found the item too similar to 
those of previous fairs.

interest in going to the vendor fair 
because I already know what is 
there." 

Ann Brady, director of the ven-
dor fair, said she and others at the 
Office of Srudent Organizations 
and Leadership Opportunities 
sought variety and popularity when 
choosing the various vendors. 

"We don 't like the vendors to

"We try to have a large variety of 
items for sale."

Center to teach engineers 
Researchers willieam how to commercialize 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD's Jacobs School of 
Engineering has received $10 mil-
lion to jump-start a new center 
that will institutionalize the 
process of moving research out of 
the lab and into the marketplace. 

The William J. von Liebig 
Foundation gave the money for 
the center, which will be called the 
William J. von Liebig Center for 
Entrepreneurism and Technology 

dYancement. 
"[We are) trying to enhance 

that process to make it easier for 
faculty members looking for com-
mercial applications of their 
research," said Abigail Barrow, the 
managing director for the center. 

T he center will guide research 
through the commercializa tion 
process and match investors with 
researchers. According to Barrow, 
advice on whether to form a new 

~mpany or license the technolo-
gy to existing companies will also 
be part of the program. 

The center aims to educate 
researchers on business concerns 
of which they might otherwise be 
unaware. The Jacobs School of 
Engineering will offer courses on 
entrepreneurism, with support 
from the von Liebig center, ori-
ented toward scientists instead of 
business students.

"UC San Diego is known 
worldwide for leadership in tech-
nology advancement through 
unique programs such as the 
Whitaker Institute of Biomedical 
Engineering, " stated Robert 
Conn, dean of the Jacobs School. 
"We believe the von Liebig 
Center will build on this great tra-
dition and will serve as a national

projects. 
model of how research universities 
can more proactively ensure that 
discoveries are translated rapidly 
and effectively for the public 
good." 

Many UCSD faculty mt:mbers 
have turned their research into 
profit. UCSD labs have spawned 
several biology, chemistry, com-
murucation, cognitive science and 
computer software companies, 
according to Barrow. 

Qualcomm, a telecommunica-
tions company founded by former 
engineering professor Irwin 
Jacobs, and Praja, a multimedia 
imaging company founded by for-

COOKIES 

mer professor Ramar Jain, are twO 
examples of commercial applica-
tion of scientific research. 

The von Liebig center will 
have a special focus on biomedical 
research because that was von 
Liebig's main interest, but it will 
not be limited to that field . Von 
Liebig, founder of Meadox 
Medicals Inc., was a medical 
device entrepreneur. 

T he center hopes to assist only 
the most promising and innovative 
research projects. 

"This should not be consid-
ered as an extension of industrial 
research labs," Barrow said. "[We 
are) trying to augment original 
research so that if a faculty mem-
ber is working on a particularly 
exciting piece of research . . . 
they can do some of the advance-
ment of the technology while 
they are within the university 
instead of having to leave the 
university ... 

To increase the involvement of 
undergraduate students, the cen-
ter plans to work with Venture 
Four, a new student organization 
that focuses on entrepreneurial 
issues. 

Joseph Bear is the acting exec-
utive director for the center, which 
will be housed in the new Powell-
Focht Bioengineering Hall, which 
is set to open in 2002 . The center 
will begin operating this fall .

California tuition 
bill unfairly favors 
illegal aliens 

. AB-540, a . me~sure 0at'would allow illegal 
all~~s who Itve In Caltfornia to pay in-state 
tuition and fees to California State 
Universities and community colleges, is a 
transpa;ent attempt to ease relations between 
the United States and other countries. 

. T he Californ ia State Assembly passed the 
bil l Sept. 14. Gov. Gray Davis vetoed the 
same measure last yea r, and after its recent 
approval by the assembly, it now awaits a 
second deCision from the governor. 

Though the measure only explicitly 
applies to CSU schools and communi ty col-
l eg~s, obs~rvers believe that, if implemented 
as .It was 10 Texas,. the UC Regents would 
qu~ckly follow suit and adopt the bill's 
pomts. 

We should not be granting benefits to 
illegal. a.liens that we do not even grant to 
U.S. clO zens. 

If we make a student from Nevada pay 
out-of-state tuition, we should make people 
who come i!l~gally from other countries pay 
the same tuJtlOn. 

Furthermore, this measure will cost the 
state money as many undocumented aliens 
already pay the out-of-state tuition. This is 
money that would be better used toward state 
scholarships that would benefit Americans 
who cannot afford to go to college. 

A country should help its taxpaying citi-
zens, of which there are plenty before it 
helps illegal aliens. ' 

Also, while the bill addresses the concern 
of easing the burden of exorbitant out-of-
state tuJtion and fees for undocumented 

Calif~rnia ~~sidents , a 'problem that even 
American citizens face , the measure is inher-
ently flawed because it does not address 
ot.her concerns such as the inability of illegal 
aliens t? work legally in the United States or 
to receive finanCIal help at either the federal 
or state level. 
. ~thout legal California residency, illegal 
Immigrants cannot apply for fin ancial ald. 
Ma~y ~tudents who already live in 
C~I~fornla and who are eligible for in-state 
tu ition cannot even afford to attend college, 
but .h~ve the opt~on of applying fo r and 
recelvmg financl~1 aid a ~ d worki ng. 
~tho~t also.g:rantmg thes~ rights to illegal 
aliens 10 addition to loweri ng their tujtion 
fees, the measure is only ha lf of the already 
flawed answer to getti ng underrepresented 
students to attend Cal ifornia colleges. 

The measure assumes that illegal aliens 
do no~ have the monetary resources to pay 
out-of-state tuition. Even if true, there are 
plenty of underrepresented legal Californja 

re~id~nts who ~~ed help. T hey should get 
pnorlty over Citizens of foreign countries

Major economic troubles are in st;;~ 
for the United States 

Bush must take more initiative to restore fragile market 
By VALERIE BURNS 
Sen ior Staff Writer 

. The American economy just finished 
Its worst two-week performance since 
the stock market crash in 1987. These 
financial troubles do not seem likely to 
stop in the near future. 

First of all , let's assess the damages. 
Last week, the Dow Jones industrial 
average dropped 14.3 percent. That was 
its greatest weekly loss since 1933 . In 
addition, the Nasdaq composite index 
lost 16.1 percent last week. 

Furthermore, the usually robust avia-
tion industry suffered nearly irreparable 
damage; stocks in the sector fell more 
than ~O percent since the four hijacked 
Amen ca n commercial airliners hit and 
destroyed two monuments of the 
American way of li fe. Thjs is despite a 
$1 5 bi ll ion government-fund ed cash-
and loan-guarantees package. 

Consumer have been absent from 
malls and thea ters since the tumultuous 
day of Sept. II , 200 I. According to a 
recent New York Tim es arti cle 
Bloomingdale'S and Macy's have encoun ~ 
te red sale 20 percent less than forecast-
ed. Auto ales have seen a 33 percent 
plunge since the attacks. One shouldn't 
stop to think for a second that the econ-
omy had n't already been heading for a 
nosedive si nce President George W. 
Bush entered office. 

In a recent New Yo"k Times article 
Robert). Barbara, the chief economist a~ 
Hoemg & Company, was quoted as say-
ing that "there were painful profit pres-
sures m most sectors of the economy in 
the months leading up to the attack." 

Corporate earnings shrinkage will cut 
into federal and state corpora te tax rev-
enue. In effect, the author of the article 
Jonathan Fuerbringer, argued that th i~ 

me~ns that "the federal budge t wi ll 
shrmk faste r, and that will put pressure 
on states to reduce spending because 
mo t of them cannot run deficits." 

Al though stocks did spring back con-
si de rabl~ ~ondar, Treasury Secretary 
Paul 0 el ll saId that the terrorist 
attacks could delay recovery in the 
world 's top economy by a "quarter or so." 
It would be a broad and dangerous state-

o t' ~"..' . ' • ) , 

ment to say that the recent tumble of the 
economy as well as the terrorist attacks 
could be blamed on an act by a single 
person. 

All the same, I think a very capable 
argument could be made that Bush's 
"hands-oW' policy toward the Middle 
East since h~s election has not only 
stramed relations between the United 
States and its OPEC friends and turned 
the stock market from a bull to a bear 
but it may have also provoked th~ 
attacks. 

Since his election, President Bush has 
employed and instructed his subordi -

I:realize now may not be 
the time to poke fun at 

Dubya; after all, it is a time 
of national crisis and he is 

the one, in charge,

current situation. 

nates to employ a very isolationist for-
eign policy toward the Middle East. He 
has made no effort to facilitate a pcace 
agreement between Yasser Arafa t and 
current Israe li Prime Minister Ariel 
Sharon. Consequently, the war has raged 
on in the Holy Land for a year now. The 
years of diplomacy efforts made by for-
mer president Bill Clinton have been for 
nothing. The proximity to a peace agree-
ment and establishment of a Palestinian 
state with Israeli approval, which seemed 
possible just a year ago, now seem like a 
century ago. 

In addi tion to his lack of concern for 
peace in the Holy Land, Bush has recent-
ly attempted to use the "Big Stick" tech-
nique populari zed by Theodore 
Roosevelt. Since the terrorist attacks he 
has sent orders and ultimatums d'aily 
throughout the Islamic world. This is not 

showing concern for what is thought to 
be most important to many in the Middle 
East: peace between the Israelis and 
Palestinians. His "Big Stick" may 
become a stick of dynamite for our 
down-home country president. 

I realize now may not be the time to 
poke fun at Dubya; after all , it is a time of 
national erisis and he is the one in charge. 
Nonetheless, the techniques he may have 
used to order ranch hands around back 
home will not be as influential in the cur-
rent situation. . 

Bush has already declared that anyone 
harboring terrorists is an enemy of the 
United States. So far, he has not revealed 
what military procedures he will use to 
combat this "aiding and abetting." 

Ho\~ever, as_earlier noted, the presi-
dent must be very careful. His current 
nonchalance toward the violence contin-
uing in Israel and Palestine, in addition 
to the continual U. S. support of Z ionism, 
has already tensed relations between the 
Uni ted States and its OPEC trading 

pa~tne rs. In addition to thi s, many 
Middle Eastern countri es think the 
United States should drop Iraqi econom-
ic sanctions, which have been active ince 
the P ersian Gul f War. 

-r:here is a deep dislike held by many 
Per Ian Gul f cou·ntrics towa rd the 
United States. eel a Banerjee of the Nr-UJ 
York Timu argues that "many Arabs 
blame the American th irst fo r oil for mir-
ing them in shaky econOJnies run by cor-
rupt leaders." Although Arab countries 
such as the United Arab E mirates, 
Palcistan and Saudi Arabia have been 
extremely cooperative with the United 
States since the attacks, at the same ti me 
these governments hold a hidden fear. 

Because of their already unstable gov-
ernments, if these countries align them-
selves too closely with American anti-ter-
rorist efforts and if Washington targets 
many Islamic countries in its own efforts 
for reven~e, moderate Arab regimes 
could ?e. Crippled by uprisings.

Arab regimes control two-thirds of the

OPINION 5 

There's more to donations than just free T-shirts 
For those who overcome fears, blood donations are a worthwhile, altruistic cause 
By CASSANDRA PIERCE 
Senior Staff Writer 

I have a lot of respect for people 
who donate blood. T hey inconve-
nience themselves fo r the health of 
others, often without getting paid 
and withou t getting the title of 
Hvolunreer." 

OK, so they get a free T-shirt 
and some orange juice, but tha t's 
noth ing compared to savi ng some-
one else's life. 

One of the reasons I respect 
blood donors so much is that I can't 
dona te. eedles and I just don't 
-agree. 

T he last ti me I had blood 
drawn, I dreaded it for days ahead 
of time. When I got to the hospital, 
my doctor decided to double the 
amount of tests she wanted done on 
my blood . T here were so many lit-
tle via ls, I was surprised that my 
heart was still pumping blood 
through my body afterward. But 
the' nurse sat me down, told me not 
to look at the 'needle and managed 
to make it relatively painless. 

Although giving · blood didn't 
hurt much, the mere idea of the 
blood loss got to me for a few days. 
If I looked at the tiny hole in the 

Economy: 
Effects of recession will 
be widespread 
Continued from page 4 
the United States has let the OPEC 
canel "know" that it would like the 
output of oil to increase so that 
prices would drop and counteract 
the current American economic 
recession . With such a basic need as 
oil hanging in the balance, the 
White House has been carefully 
analyzing which forms of retribu-
tion it will employ in response to 
the terrorist attacks, keeping in 
mind, of course, that these actions 
could affect American oi l supplies. 

Hopefully the White House will 
make significant preparations so 
that the huge backswing of Dubya's 
big stick does not hit himself, as 
well as the American economy, in 
the ass, causing even more domes-
tic turmoil. 

It is imponant to consider that 
the OPEC cartel had no problem 
placing an oi l embargo on the 
United States in 1973 in response 
to American Support of Israel in 
the Middle East War. 

T here is no doubt that the 
American economy is headed for a 
deep recession. Conflict abroad has 
made consumers wary of delving 
deeper into credit deot. Huge lay-
offs have been made in both the 
aviation and technology industries 
in the last couple weeks. 

I myself have even felt the 
effects of the approaching econom-
ic troubles. My roommate, who 
until recently worked in the real 
estate industry, just got laid off. 
Supposedly the real estate business 
in San Diego is booming. 
Nonetheless, he and 40 other 
employees were let go by 
Commonwealth Land and Title 

• two weeks ago. Obviously, the eco-
nomic hurt has already begun. 
Usually the American economy is 
prosperous during times of war; 
this time it is quite the opposite. 

In order to fight a war we need 
oil. Unfortunately, oil is stra tegical-
ly placed within many countries the 
ci tizens and leaders of which may 

enemy, the 

crook of my elbow or thought about 
the process, I would shudder to think 
how much of my blood had been 
sucked out through that iny bitty 
hole. It was my blood. I'm very pos-
sessive about that kind of thing. It's 
nor the kind of thing I share with 
people, as I do my pens or pencils. 

T he problem is, I'm not the 
only one who feels this way. If I 
were, I could get used to the idea of 
being some lci nd of weirdo who 
didn't like needles. T here are thou-
sands of people like me. 

Many who don't necessaril y 
freak out at the sight of a hypoder-
mic needle and who are eligible to 
donate just don't have the time or 
the inclination to do so. This is get-
ting to be a problem in the Uni ted 
States beca use our standards for 
blood donation are getting higher 
and more people need transfu ions, 
yet fewer people want to donate. 
One estimate says that the United 
States will need 250,000 more units 
of blood than people will donate 
this year. 

T here are twO possible solu-
tions. One, with which I agree, is to 
get more people to donate blood. 

T he other one, which is more 
compl icated and will take much 

longer, is to find a chemical substi-
tute for blood that can be used in 
operations and trauma sinlations. 
T his option is curren tly receivi ng a 
lot of attention, probably because it 
will lift the burden of guilt off those 
of us who don't donate. 

There are two fairly promising 
paths of resea rch in the area of 
blood substitutes: plasma volume 
expanders and oxygen carriers. 
T hey are very lucrative fields for 
pharmaceutical companies, two of 
the major players being BioTime, 
Inc. and the Al liance 
Pharmaceutical Corp. 

Biolime makes a product called 
I lextend, which is a chemically bal-
anced plasma expander. Plasma 
expanders' arc based on a starch mol-
ecule that maintains blood pressure 
when blood is lost. They are later 
metabolized by the body and 
removed from the bloodstream. 

T he problem with plasma 
expanders is that they don't have 
the abi li ty to carry. oxygen to the 
body and if blood is lost in great 
quantities, the patient will still need 
a transfusion. 

P lasma expanders can tem-
porarily allow people \vith blood 
loss to survive without blood. If a 

patient undergoes surgery, blood is 
removed and then put back in after 
the operation. 

Also, with the use of plasma 
expanders, trauma patients C'ln be 
tabilized instead of needing blood 

immediately. 
Plasma expanders are often used 

with hyperbaric chambers, whIch 
involve the use of pressurized oxy-
gen to increase the level of tile nec-
essary gas in the patient's immedi -
ate environment. 

Plasma expanders prolong the 
time before transfusion becomes 
necessary, but they don't reduce the 
need for blood donations. 

Oxygen carriers, however, are 
able to deliver needed oxygen to 
the body. 

Alliance Pharmaceutical makes 
an oxygen carrier called Oxygent, 
which is made of flu orocarbons. 
This o~)'gen carrier supplies oxygen 
ro tlle body faster than blood ItSelf, 
but it doesn't provide blood's healing 
and disease-fighting properties. 

Oxygent is sti ll in its testing 
phase. It has not been approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration, 
a process that could take years or 
may not even happen at all , depend-
ing on the results of the trials. It IS 

still unknown whether it can he .. a fc -
Iy used on trauma patients. The w,e 
of tllis product isn't a viahle option 
for people at present.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER Z7, ZOO! 

Choice of major need not 
prove stifling to future path 
By BRIAN WOO 
Contributing Writer 

My friends tell me I'm in denial. 
I tried writing something sin-

cere and poignant about Sept. II , 
but given my ignorance on worldly 
affairs and the fact that I'm usually 
insincere to begin with, failure was 
the only option. 

So after consulting one of my 
best friends, [ decided instead that 
as I embark on my fourth and final 
year at UCSD, I'd pause to reflect 
on life after college. I wanted main-
ly to assess all the "exciting and 
promising career opportunities" 
available to social science majors 
that I was promised access to upon 
my graduation . . 

Most summers, r aimlessly wan-
der around until something falls in 
my lap. However, last year proved 
difficult for me, and after some soul 
searching I decided to try to find a 
job. 

This time, I decided that I 
would have motivation and a plan 
of action. I'm scarcely more quali-
fied than when I graduated from 
hIgh school, so I figured some real 
world experience would be good 
for me. I'm faced \vith the problem 
of not really knowing what I want 
to do with my life. 

My brilliantly commonplace 
scheme started with my application 
to three places: Tower Records, 
Barnes & Noble and Starbucks. 
The logic behind it was that I like 
four things: books, music, coffee 
and women. Since you can't really 
specia li ze in women, I went with 
the other three. 

tarbucks happened to be the 
only place hiring, and thus the only 
one that interviewed me. It made 
up for the lack of interviews else-
where by sheer quantity. 1 had 

three interviews at one store before 
being sent to a different stOre for 
another interview. 

Four interviews and two stores 
later. I had a job. My father meets 
with drug representatives and the 
most respected members of the 
medical community across the 
nation, and he had only two inter-
views. 

I tend to hate anything tOo 
corporate, but r feel [ have 
enough self-loathi ng to deliber-
ately seek out a job I had already 

What I've discovered, 
contrary to the advice 

and guidance I've 
received throughout 

the years, is that your 
major doesn't amount 

to ali that much. It 
certainly doesn't 

decide the course of 
your life or what you 

end up doing. 

planned to hate. It was either 
Starbucks or the Gap. A few 
months ago, I was making jokes 
about Starbucks - now here ram , 
working for them. 

Of course, corporate as 
Srarbucks is, trainees had to go to a 
seminar called "The Starbucks 
Experience." When we had to 
complete a written response (and 
no, I'm not kidding) about our on-
the-job goals, I wrote, "To provide 
exemplary service in the face of 
adver ity, sheer danger and almost 
certain death." Really, would you 
want your barista to provide any-

experience@screenblast.com 

thing less? Later, [ promised to give 
people correct change and nor to 
pocket money from the register. 

What I've discovered, contrary 
to the advice and guidance I've 
received throughout the years, is 
that your major doesn't amount to 
all that much. It certainly doesn't 
decide the course of your life or 
what you end up doing. 

As long as [ can remember, I've 
heard advisers harp on how your 
choice of a major will determine 
the rest of your life, but that's rub-
bish. What you end up doing may 
be completely different than what-
ever major you pick our of the 
course catalog. 

The friend [ mentioned earlier 
i the perfect example - he grad-
uated with an English major and 
now works at a video game compa-
ny. 

Employers seem to like the fact 
that you have a degree. They don't 
necessarily care what it is . 

The utility of a college dcgree is 
analogous to my experience in high 
school gym class. It doesn't matter 
how good you are, just make sure 
you've given it some effort. 

And wha t ['m discoveri ng as I 
get closer to ending my collegiate 
years is that we're not suppo ed to 
have it all figured out by the time 
we graduate. We have as much 
time as it takes. V\'hat the advl er 
don't tell US is that after we grad-
uate, we spend the next decade or 
so sorting it all out. \,ve're not 
supposed to have our lives micro-
managed down to the last detail 
while wc 're still in our twenties 
(or ever, hopefully). 

As [ start my senior year looking 
out from the counter at Starbuck!>, 
[ have to repeat to myself, "Tlus is 
OK - this is how it's supposed to 
be." 

Watch me. Catch me. Play me. Use me anytime you like. Now 
there's a place where you are truly part of the action. The drama. 

The music. The sci-filhorror. The comedy. Original creations from 
users like you. Screenblast '"- experience it.

Student visas facing moratorium 
Feinstein proposes freeze for security reasons 

Universities offer more 
benefits to attract officials 

AUSTIN, Texas - U.S. Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is con-
sidering proposing a six-month 
moratorium on all student visas to 
ensure national security, according 
to aides. 

Colleges shelling out more to 
retain top brass 

By Steve Brauntuch 
-Daily Pennsylvanian (U. 

Pennsylvania) 

PHILADELPHIA - A six-
figure salaty, a company car, a 
five-bedroom house without a 
mortgage. 

Sound like the benefits of a 
Fortune 500 CEO? Think again. 

With the market for college-
level administrators becoming 
more competitive, schools have 
been forced to make more attrac-
tive offers to lure and retain the 
most talented individuals in acad-
emia - and out of the frequently 
more lucrative corporate world. 

In some cases, academic insti-
tutioQs are finding that their 
competition for qualified candi-
dates, such as University of 
Pennsylvania President Judith 
Rodin, Provost Robert Barchi 
and Executive Vice President 
John Fry, extends into other 
industries. 

"When you think of a univer-
sity like Penn, you've got to get 
the very top people," said Joan 
Blumenthal , principal and 

founder of Blumenthal-Hart, a 
retained search firm. "It's no dif-
ferent if you're General Electric 
or the University of 
Pennsylvania. " 

Benefits programs, perfor-
mance plans, signing bonuses -
it 's all part of a recruitment 
process that has become more 
poli tical than ever before. 

"Universities are finding 
themselves in the same competi-
tive markets as private industries, 
and they are finding that they 
have had to employ some of the 
same practices that industry 
would employ," said Stephen 
Otzenberger, executive director 
of the College and University 
Profess ional Association for 
Human Resources, or CUPA-
HR. 

In addition to six- fi gure 
salaries, many administrators 
receive performance bonuses, 
housing and insurance benefits 
and even loans through the 

• University. 
CUPA-H R President Patricia 

Couger said that the financial 
packages that were once offered

This comes shortly after federal 
investigators learned that at least 
one of the terrorists involved in the 
Sept. 11 attacks was in the United 
States on a student visa. The mora-
torium would stall the authoriza-
tion of new visas for the next six 
months. 

"It 's just one of a number of 
options we are considering," said 
Scott Gerber, Feinstein 's 
spokesman. "She's concerned about 
whether people will abuse (student 
visas} to get into the country ille-
gally." 

Kitty Villa, an assistant director 
at the University of Texas 
International Office, sa id if such a 
policy goes into effect there could 
be some dangerous implications for 
students. 

"The broadest implication is 
that many graduate departments 
may have difficulty bringing in new 
students," Villa said. "(At this 
point}, a moratorium would not 
affect the fall semester, but it might 
create an atmosphere in which stu-
dents might feci that there's no 
point in making plans to study here 
if they think they can't get a visa."

2,699 were international students. 
Though legislators and officials 

are looking for any possible way to 
improve security, the screening 
process for student visa applicants 
is already fairly tight and the gov-
ernment is working to fill in any 
holes, said Valerie Cluttenden, a 
spokesperson for the Bureau of 

'Everyone expects 
closer scrutiny of 

applications for 
student visas and we 

should be sure it is 
moderated with 

reason.' 

-Kitty Villa 
UT International Office 

Consular Affairs. 
Students applying for a student 

visa must meet a number of 
requirements, ranging from finan-
cial and educational qualifications 
to a computer backgro~d check 
and a personal interview with a 

. state department official. 
"Our computer system is set up 

to where an applicant cannot be 
issued a visa without the back-
ground check being done," 
C hittenden said. "Also, if there are 
any violations on the record, a visa 

cannot be issued." 
After a student has received a 

visa, he or she can sti ll be rejected 
and sem back by the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service if there 
are any security concerns. Villa 
stressed the importance of 
strengthening the current policies 
rather than completely stopping 
the flow of students from other 
nations. 

"We need to look carefully at 
the mechanisms already in place," 
she said. "That makes more sense 
than to decide to cut off all interna-
tional exchange. To assume that 
anyone coming from another coun-
try is a part of the problem is not a 
measured approach." 

\Vith an estimated 4,500 inter-
national students currently attend-
ing the University, any federal mea-
sure that may reduce or stop the 
issuance of student visas can have a 
serious impact, Villa sa id. 

"We are already concerned 
about the impact (of the attack} on 
international enrollment," Villa 
said. "It will be very important for 
graduate departments to act quick-
ly and make admissions decisions to 
all ow students ample time to

Performance plans are common 
for high-ranking officers in the 
busincss sector, where administra-
tors are o ften paid based on how 
well they accomplish certain goals 
and standards that are set for them. 

It wasn 't un ti l recentl y, however, 
that this concept entered the acad-
emic sector on a broad scale. 

"More and more universities arc

they're givcn raises based on 
whether they have accomplished 
their goals. They are in many 
respects similar to corporate 
America ." 

Since other industries are com-
peting with universities for the top 
candidates, standards of evaluation 
have bt!come even more crucial for 
schools looking to recruit adminis-
tra to rs. 

Couger said that much li ke 
CEOs in other industries, academ-
IC administrators may be evaluated 
on their performance in fund rais-
mg, academic program~ or work In 
the politica l arena. Thc emphasis 
on performance may be lead ing 
some officials to spend less rime

and, according to some, focus on 
lhe financial bottom line . 

ult 's vcty important to c tablish 
measu rable ta nda rds and hold 
pcople accountable," Couger aid. 
"Thc bottom line in thc private 
sector is whether you're in thc red 
or the black at the end of the year." 

Fi rms in o ther industries, such 
as consulting o r finance, will offer 
up-front signing bonuses to lu re 
cand idates away from their admin-
istrative positions at colleges. 

O n the other end, some ullive r-
sities offer retention bonuses fo r 
officia ls who stay on and avoid t he 
temptation of moving into thc fre -

Retention can be cmical to

What di st inguishes San Diego from many othcr cities of comparable size is 
that it feels like a much 
smaller town. This is due 
largely to the fact that what 
we call San Diego is really a 
patchwork of distinct com-
munities loosely bound 
together by ordinances and 
area codes. Every community 
in the city, from Del Mar to 
Golden Hill, has its own par-
ticular vibe, its own charac-
teristic denizens and its own 
cu ltura l and commun ity 
events. 

The crowning example of 
community togetherness is 

the street festival, when the 
legendary weather San 
Diegans are blessed with 
leads them to take their par-
tics into the street . Year-
round, we host events featur-
ing music, food and vcndors 
catering to every personality. 
Now, as fall dawns, the great-
est of these is upon us oncc 
again. 

T he weekend of Sept. 29 
and Sept. 30 will find 
Normal Heights transformed 
from a quirky but calm pock-
et of San Diego into a sun-
drenched celebration of the 
best this city has to offer.

University Events Office 
debuts this year's lineup 
Unique music and dance productions from 
around the world will arrive at UCSD 
By LINDSAY BOYD 
Senior Staff Writer 

Each year, the University Events Office at UCSD pre-sents about 20 world music 
and dance performances. This year, 
performers from different coun-
tries and musical genres will bring 
UCSD the best of music and dance. 

The season kicks off with two 
San Diego premieres: The Sean 
Curran Dance Company on Oct. 
13 and Nov. 4, and Kosong 
Okwangdae, which performs 
Korean traditional masked dance. ' 

The Sean Curran Company will 
perform four pieces, including 
"Folk Dance for the Future." 

"Sean Curran began his train-
ing with traditional Irish step 
dancing and progressed into mod-
ern dance with the Bill T. 
Jones/Arni e Zane Dance 
Company," said Judi Griffith, an 
events office representative. 
"With his own company, he cre-
ates dance infused with his signa-
ture vi rUlosity, complex musicality

izens and S( 0 for sUldents.

of Kosong. Kosong Olcwangdae

Bob Sindar 
Cerrone 

Sound of Barclay 

**** 
Who is Bob Sinclar? 

Sinclar comes from the 
imagination of Parisian 
Chris Le Friant - Sinclar 
is also his alter ego. Sinclar 
is a world famous DJ , 
reJTlil'er and producer. 

SincIar has a specialized 
groove. The retro-disco 
sound behind his music is 
complemented by a sensu-
al house-beat and modern 
production methods that 
get you going on the dance 
floor. 

Sinclar's credits are 
everywhere. His remixes of 
dozens of songs are on 
many records and huge sin-
gles such as Stardust's "The 
Music Sounds Better With 
You." SincIar's recent studio 
album, "Champs Elysees," 
captures the sounds of disco 
and R&B in the '70s, and 
creates a soulful blend of 
very danceable club music. 

Sinclar returns with 
arrangements of the work of 
classic disco producer J ean-
Marc Cerrone. Almost 

everything on "Cerrone by 
Bob Sinclar" is a classic hit 
from the '70s, but is 
reworked to achieve the 
modern sound of house 
music. 

This is French house at 
its very best. 

There are cia sics like 
"Love in C Minor" and 
"Supernantre." There is a 
spicy Latin sound in 
"Revelacion" and funky 
disco-guitars scattered 
throughout the mix. House 
producers like Modjo 
(lenown for "Lady") also 
make an appearance on this 
album. There are remixes 
by Spiller (known (or the 
hit single "Groovejet [If 
This Ain't Love]") and pro-
gressive house master 
Danny Tenaglia. 

Sinclar also slips in one 
of his own songs ("I Feel 
For You") to mix beautiful-
lyon top of Cerrone's 
"Look For Love," which 
results in nothing short of 
pure glamor. 

Soulful vocals dominate 
"Standing in the Rain," 
and the horns and funky 
bass-line of this song -
and practically the entire 
album - can transport you 
to a mansion in the hills of 
Hollywood for some 
swank disco-party, the gli t-
tery nightlife in Vegas or 
the steamy clubs of Paris. 

This album mixes 
French disco-house sound 
with Latin instrumentals 
and the pace of deep house. 
"Cerrone by Bob Sinclar" 
is fit for any party or for 
cruising through the city 
streets with the top down. 

-Joseph Lee 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

album 

Spa'!lIIIn Spiff 
The love EP 
self-released 

***** 
Spaceman Spiff. Funny 

name, eh? How many of 
you recognize this as a 
Calvin and Hobbes refer-
ence? Probably a lot of 
you. But how many of you 
Ienow this is probably one 
of the best hip-hop-infused 
jazz acts in San Diego? 

There is a distinct ja7,z 
sound in this music, with 
classic jazz chords that 
reveal the light sounds of 
the sax and flute. The funic 
in the drums and bass gives 
the sound that extra edge. 
The smooth vocals of Ivan 
Garzon will make anyone 
feel the foot-tapping and 
body-swaying groove of 
the music. 

You could compare 
Spaceman Spiff to a jazzier 
Jamiroquai, but almost all 
of Spifrs material is origi-
na l. T he ta lent of this 
quarte t is more than appar-
ent on "The Love EP." 

As voca list and bass 
player, Garzon studied bass 
guitar at the California 

• reviews 
InstiUlte for the Arts. The 
man with the S3..,( and the 
flute is Clay El liot, who also 
does some vocal work and 
has a degree in jazz perfor-
mance from San Diego 
State University. Brill iant 
guitarist Tommy Coll ins 
has his degree in music 
education, and versati le 
drummer Mike an non 
teaches drum classes for 
high school students. 

"That Something" 
opens up with the flute 
floating over the fu nky 
guitar and groovy bass-line 
with a great sing-along 
chorus: "Girl you have that 
somethin' that leaves me 
wanting you." 

There are songs of 
admiration with words like 
"All I wanna do is love you, 
tell me you'll always stay" 
in "Always Stay," as well as 
songs of pure passion in 
"You Possess" with the 
lyrics, "You're hypnotizing, 
so mesmerizing. My heat is 
rising, utilizing everything 
that feels so good." 

This is truly an album 
of love and is perfect for 
any late night with candles, 
a bottle of red wine and 
someone special. 

The only critici m is 
that the album is painfully 
short and there isn't very 
much room to hear the tal-
ent that can be completely 
expressed in a live perfor-
mance. 0 for now you'll 
have to live with the repeat 
button unti l Spaceman Spiff 
comes out wi th a ful l album. 

With their growing 
success, that can't be too 
far away. 

-Joseph Lee 

Vivid 
Vivid 

Flesh in Tension 

*** 
Is there anything truly 

unique about the sound of 
San Diego band Vivid? At 
first, not reall y. T his is a 
pop-rock group with 
catchy hooks and great 
sing-along lyrics. 

Their self-titled album 
is the stuff summer 
anthems are made of -
the kind of stuff you will 
find in MP3 playlists and 
backyard fra terni ty barbe-
cues. Vivid has a very pol-
ished sound with distorted 
gui tars, ri ffs and drum fi lls 
placed in all the right 
places. It will fulfill your 
gui lty fun pop music 
needs. 

Inevitably, with a band 
that is trying to break into 
the notoriously difficult 
pop-rock market, there 
will be comparisons. So 
here I go with mine: Vivid 
is like Lit but less obnox-
ious. Third Eye Blind but 
without that a'nnoying 
syrupy pop sound. 
Everclear? Please, Vivid 

HIATUS II 

blows them out of the 
water. 

Ivid seems to bl end 
all of th e good th ings 
about Amcrican rock and 
gets rid of mo,t of the 
anno),ances accompani ed 
by pop. 

oca li , t-gultamt ' lc rran 
Trousset ha~ allllo,t a SocIal 
Distortion vocal 4ualt ty on 
"More Time Alone." 
"Relentless" is light, relax-
ing and has an almost Peter 
,abriel-like quality. 

You ca.n ense influ-
ences ranging from T he 
Clash to Stroke 9. "Renee" 
and "Everlasti ng La" have 
a very energetic, three-
chord punk-rock feeling 
and are sure to create 3 
mosh pi t. I see "Funky 
Revolution" prompting 
fi st-pumping and crowd-
surfing as the audie nce 
yells back, "I'm talki ng 
about a funky revolution! 
Just stOP all your fuss and 
get on the bus!" But fear 
not, all of the lyrics are not 
as inane. 

There is some deeper 
symbolism about her,,!!.> in 
"Youth Pilots, " ,d the 
scrutiny of pe ,pI e is 
addressed in "All or 
Nothin'." 

So, is there anyth ing 
truly unique about th e 
sonic formations of Vivid ' 
T hey don 't reinvcnt thl 
sounds of pop-rock, but 
this sUlff sounds better 
than a lot of other group, 
on the radi o today. 

So God forbid you walk 
past all that Limp Bizki t 
and P.O.D. crap and pick 
up some Vivid.

Fashion heroes: Ben Stiller and Ovven Wilson pair up in the comedy Zoolander 
which is in theatres this Friday. 

Uninspiring Zoo lander proves 
to be cinematic mismatch 
Fashion inspired comedy lacks original 
substance, has only empty glamour 
By RINALDO DORMAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Ben Stiller's latest offering, "Zoolander," follows the plight of male supermodels who are 
brainwashed to lcill the prime minis-
ter of Malaysia. The movie is' ultra-
brief, poorly played out with VIsual 
ga!,"s, easily forgettable and contains 
largely unnecessary cameos. 

Stiller's screen presence is awk-
ward, fish-lipped and contrasts with 
the rest of the cast's considerably 
more relaxed attinlde. Matilda, the 
love interest and orgy participant 
played by Christine Taylor, and 
several other characters are well-
delivered but uninspired. The fash-
ion-oriented plot boasts a very 
glossy and visually appealing look, 
but ubstance of any lcind is lacking. 

Comedically, "Zoolander" is a 
disappointment but is a move away 
from the painful can't-get-any-
worse ~'pproach of "Meet The 
Parents. 

Problems stem from the movie's 
reliance on dry Snlpidity - yes, 
\vith a capital S - instead of punch 
lines. The amusing characters, 
including Will Ferrell as J acobim 
Mugaru and a few other minor 
role, get little attention. What 
they do receive is homoeroticism or 
easy, lcitschy gags. As Hansel, 
Owen Wilson rides a scooter and 
displays pseudo-Hindu spirituality. 
Zoolander's roommates, who are 
also fellow male supermodels, die 
after they spew each other with 
gasoline in a car wash-style hose 
down. 

Many famous faces show up in 
this movie - David Bowie and 
Winona Ryder make appearances 
do little to improve the film . Then

REVIEW 

again, most of the scenes do very 
little, so it's no big loss. The overall 
cffect of "Zoolander" is a few 
chuckles and a lot of time waiting 
for the laughter to begin . 

"Zoolander" gets worse as the 
product placements get in reasingly 
blatant. At times, "Zoolander" 
amounts to little more then a string 
of logo-focused scenes. Certain 
brightly-colored, fruit-named com-
puters got a big segment of time, as 
did several other less-than-stealthy 
product placements at the VH I 
Fashion Awards, which apparently 
are now the most important fashion 
event in the world. 

This movie is missable at best, 
deserving little if any praise. At its 
worst, you will be hiding yawns. 
The upside is that "Zoolander" is 
not acrually bad, it's just not good. 
As with IllOSt movies, you already 
know the best scenes from thc trail-
ers. Save the $S and two hours of 
your li fe by opting not to support 
Stiller's ego - he dirccted and co-
wrote "Zoolander" and was one of 
its eight producers. To Stun up, as 
Jay Sherman said on the TV show 
"The Critic": "F'eh ."

Future of A.S. programming 
emphasis lies in music, concerts 
A.S. Programming Commissioner Eisha Christian 
discusses yearly plans in Guardian interview 
By CHARUE fRAN 
Hiatus Editor 

One of the most highly scrutinized jobs on the A.S. Council would have to be A.S. commissioner of programming. 
Besides coordinating and planning all major 
on-campus events, the programmer has to 
constantly meet with a variety of media 
agents to ensure quality events. 

• This yea r's A.S . programmer, Eisha 
Christian, is loolcing to improve the selection 
of events. An interview with Christian shed 
some light to how entertainment is brought 
to UCSD: 

What is your job as A.S. programmer? 
I oversee all the entertainment events 

that corne out and are put on by the A.S. I 
oversee the festivals, the TGIF, the club 
shows at the Pub, which we started last year, 
and thc' nooner hows. Specifically, it 's more 
of an overseeing position. 

Besides the major music concerts and 
clubs, are there any arts or entertain-
ment events that are put on by 
Associated Stud ents? 

Usually, we have speakers as well. Last 
year we did "Loveline." The turnout was a 
little bit low so this year I'm not so sure if we 
want to have a lecnlre or rum that money 
around and put it into Sun God. Right now, 
the feedback from the campus is that they'd 
rather sec music entertai nment than speakcr 
cntertainment. Right now, it's on hold. But 

Eisha 
Christian 

AS Commissioner 
of Programming 

if people want to see bigger acts, that's defi-
nitely my No. I priority. 

You put Club Ritmo at Porter's Pub. 
What is it and what goes on there? 

Last yea r we were asked to find some-
thing that we could possibly work with at 
The Stage at the Pub and use that venue. 
We were debating at first to have more of 
just a chill , rock-type atmosphere, but then 
we finally decided on a club-dance atmos-
phere on campus. The way things worked 
Out, we had a lot of old-school hip-hop 
artists because of the costs and thc venue. 

What is the future of the club shows? 
This quarter we 're on a break because 

the Pub is being renovated with new dance 
lighting and carpets. Our first show will bc 
winter quarter and it will be more of like a 
grand unveiling. So, I'm hoping it will be 
more of a club-type, dancc-type atmosphere 
that should acrually be branching out into 
DJs and sruff like that. Right now it will stay 
with live acts rather than DJs, 0 wc'll se

Annual San Diego Music Awards 
• announces nominees 

Tickets still available online for Oct. 9 ceremony 
honoring and recognizing local bands 
By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 
Senior Staff Writer 

I f you are like most UCSD srudents -that is, from somewhere other than America's Finest City - your k.nowl-
edge of San Diego music is pretty much lim-
ited to Blink-IS2 and Jewel. Never mind 
that Blink come from that distant, red-
headed stepchild of a suburb: Poway. And 
never mind that the Coffee I louse Queen is 
an Alaskan masquerading as a SoCaler. 

Our local music sccne has much morc to 
it than that. Pick up a copy of Sttlmm or the 
Stili Ditgo ReadL7, available on campus, and 
dive into the myriad musical events and CD 

review~ . There 's plenty of homcb'Town tal - . 
ent around, in all musical genres - and yes, 
many are purveyors of poppy punk or are 
sou I fu I si nger-songwri ters. 

The best of the varied and dizzyingly tal-
ented pool of music acts in San Dicgo are 
honored every year at the aptly named San 
Diego Music Awards. 

This year's ceremony is Tuesday, Oct. 9 
at Humphrey's by the Bay. Its performers 
include The Incredible Moses Leroy, whose 
obnoxiously upbeat "Fuzzy" swamped alter-
native radio last spri ng, as well as Convoy, 
Bastard ons of Johnny Cash, ovaMenco, 
Switch foot and Soulcracker. 

Tickets can be purchased through 
lickem13ster or at the Humphrey's box of-fice 
if you'd prefer to avoid the service charge. 

Local music fans can get involved with 
the awards before the show date, though. 
Voting for many of the tOp honors is now 
underway at http://w7vw.stllldicgomllsi-
c/lWtlrds.com. Anyone with a few spare min-
utes can shapc San Diego music history.

A.S.: 
WinterFest concert the only 
charity event of the year 
Continued from page 13 
where it goes in winter. 

Some say that there are better 
uses of money, noting the small 
attendance at Club Ritmo. What 
do you say to that? 

I honestly say that we max out 
our capacity every time. As far as 
turnout, I think the turnout is pret-
ty good, especially for the venue. 
And what we've done with it is to 
make it bigger than it has been in 
the past. 

As far as money, you will find 
that you can't get into a club here 
with a live act for less than $20. And 
the fact that we did put on hows 
for less than $8 - people were real -
ly surprised, and thar's why we also 
got off-campus crowds as well. You 
can't go anywhere else and get that 
cheap of a cost. 

There's a lot of apathy toward 
on-campus events. How are you 
trying to change that? 

[ know for our Welcome Week 
dance we had the biggest turnout 
we ever had. I've never seen so 
many people show up. People kept 
on coming and I thinlc that's a good 
sign - this year we are really get-
ting into stuff. 

Our Fall Fest lineup is also going 
to bring huge crowds as well. A 
focu of this office during the sum-
mer was making sure that FallFest 
opened up with a band and every-
thing else would fall in place from 
there. [ want students to come out 
amI say, "You know what? This is 
great. This is cool. This is fun and 
I'm having a good time," and not 
come and complain about it. We do 
want students to have fun and that's 
our No. I aim. If students don't 
want to come to our events, then 
why even bother to do it? 

Of the three major quarterly fes-
tivals, historically, WmterFest is 
the least attended. Some people 
are saying we_ should drop 
WinterFest and use that money 
toward better bands during Sun 
God and FallFest. Do you think 
that is a viable option? 

Not this year. WtnterFest is our 
charity show of the year. And I 
think if we do get rid of it, it's a sign 
that our student body is really apa-
thetic about the world In general. 
So for us to get rid of the only char-
ity show that we do is just a wrong 
move. Sure we're here to entertain 
people, but we need to make sure 
we balance that with a more posi-
tive aim. This year, I do want to see 
more of it. I do thinlc this year's 
WtnterFest will be strong. To be 
honest, I thinlc programming is 50 
percent hard work and 50 percent 
luck. You need both, and it's not 
that people haven't put in, it's just a 
hard time of year to program for. 

What type of music do you want 
to focus on? 

Honestly, it's what the campus 
wants. We don't have a "focus on" 
type of music. We kind of do follow 
with mains·tream. Every now and 
then we want to get underground 
hip-hop out here, more Face to 
Face - stuff like that. Just from the 
past, UCSD does not come out to 
shows that they haven't heard the 
names of the artistJlO matter how 
good they are. Definitely, we're 
going with what's doing well in the 
market at that time. 

How do you plan to reach out to 
the student body? 

I hope to have a Web site start-
ed up soon. My hope is that stu-
dents would have some place they 
can check every weekend and it 
would be updated weekly with 
what's going on. Eventually, recaps 
of the events and artists interviews 
and possibly, in the far future, 
maybe more stuff with the local San 
Diego music· scene. It's at

They don't ca ll it a fair for

Fair: 
Variety of SDMA nominees 
performing on stage 
Continued from page 15 
each of them puts on a heck of a 
show. 

Another great gal guitarist is 
Mary Dolan, who graces the 
Lestat's Coffee House Stage on 

arurday afternoon. Her slightly 
spastic stage presence is a good 
lead-in to that afternoon's next 
act, the ational Comedy 
Theater, for a break from the 
tunes. 

But let's say you show up at the 
festival and are suddenly struck 
with a crippl ing bout of chronic 
fatigue syndrome, leaving you with 
no choice but to spend all day at 
one stage. Although the real 
essence of the street fair experience 
is to wander aimlessly and sample 
the stages with the capriciousness 
one affords a banquet of free food, 
if you see only one stage, make it 
the San Diego Music Awards Stage 
at DeMille's. 

All the acts performing at this 
stage are nominees for this year:~ 
San -Diego Music Awards, and the 
deservedness of this honor is readi-
ly apparent. Pretty much any of the 
bands. performing on this stage 
either day is a solid bet. Make this 
stage your Saturday night destina-

tion, because Jose Sinatra and the 
Troy Dante Inferno is not an act to 
miss. They classify themselves as 
"lounge metal," but the cumulative 
\!ffect of mangled covers and med-
leys of '60s and '70s staples, hilari -
ous parodies about sex with celebri-
ties and o ne very unique lead singer 
in a tight velvet leisure suit is inex-
pressible in a cute genre catch-all . 

The late-night slot at the-SOMA 
stage is filled by the Bastard Sons of 
Johnny Cash, a slightly less flamboy-
ant group that nonetheless knows 
how to work the crowd and kick 
some counay bun. They prove that 
the most amazing thing about the 
San Diego music sc~ne is that some 
of these bands stick around as long as 
they do without being snapped up by 
major labels and shipped aU over the 
COlUlay on tours. 

Sunday evening also finds great 
bands at the SOMA stage. The 
Shambles SpOilt classic SO-style 
pop, and Pink Froyd transitions 
smoothly from the bar scene to the 
fairs main slllge. 

The Adams Avenue Street Fair 
doesn't boast the nationally-known 
names of Street Scene, the high-
brow art of the La Jolla fest or the 
~ ll -out rowdiness of the PB Block 
Party. However, its irresistible 
atmosphere comes straight from 
the heart of Normal Heights and 
all of San Diego. It is laid-back 
SoCal at its best, and it's the perfect 
way to spend a weekend.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

When you pick up the 
Gllardian, you might wonder 
who these editors reall y are . 
After all, the god-like cparacters 
that produce such a poli tically 
balanced, high-quali ry newspa -
per may seem out of reach to the 
common student. 

One might wonder, how can I 
ever relate to such talent? 

Or one might ask, is it possi-
ble that I have somethmg in 
common with these journalistic 
demagogues? 

The next logical query would 
be, do these peopl e actuaily 
breathe tl,e same air that I do? 

Well, the editors have provid-
ed me with a li st of their five 
favorite albums. With th.is you 
may conclude that these people 

HIATU 19 

albums 
are human after all. 

You might think, "I ley, tl,ey 
listen to the same crappy pop 
music that r do'" Or, "Hey, the>' 
listen the same great post-indus-
tri a 1- two-chord - ra ge-chi II -ou t-
techno-euro-pop music that I li s-
ten to!" 

Agree or disagree ? Please

amazlIlg .lcl'Olllplishment. 

T,\·o yca rs ago, a cottlmittee 
consisting of UCSD st.lff, coaches, 
aluttllll, cottlllluniry mcmbers and 
representanve; of the Sa n Diego 
Padres explored the pmsibilities of 
addlll!( on to the current ballpark. 
The eventual design that came Ollt 
of that comlllittee is what the pro-
gram plans to build with this $4 
million ca mpaign . 

Anyone who has visited the cur-
rent b~scball tield can attest to the 
fact that It is not exactly what onc 
would consider a hmlry ballpark. 
All of those entimcllts should 
change with the new additions. 

With Major League Bascball 
teJIllS ~pendi ng hundreds of mil -
lions of dollars on new stadi ums, 

just how much better can the new 
stadium actua ll y be with a relative-
ly miniature price tag of $4 mil -
lion? Surprisingly better. 

Upon completion of the new 
park, fans will see the difference as 
soon as they approach the stadium. 

The new baseball facility will 
sport an entrance marquee, 
reminding visiting fans just where 
they arc. They will then proceed 
to the new ticket window to pur-
chase <\ seat from various location, 
each specifically designed to give 
fans a real sense of intimacy as 
they watch the game. 

There will also be stadium-
style seati ng that will hold 
between 500 and 1,000 fans . -Iwo 
hundred bleacher-style seats will 
loca ted just above the home 
dugout. for fans wishing to l:3SU-
ally watch an afternoon game, 
there will be a grassy hill located 
along the third-base line. There is 
also room for additional bleacher 
seati ng. An elevator will be avail-
able to take all fans to different 
levels of seating. 

for fans wi hing to wa tch the 
game in further luxury, there will 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

be two VI P sui tes tha t come 
equiped with restrooms and stadi-
um-style seating. 

An announcer's booth and 
media viewing area will also be 
located behind home plate. 

There wi ll be wheelchair access 
to all levels of seating. 

For in-game enjoyment, a 
full-service concession stand will 
serve any eati ng and drinking 
cravings experienced by the 
Triton faithful. Restrooms will 
also be available to fans as well as 
a first aid center. 

In an effort to help out UCSD's 
baseball team, a team room will be 
attached to the home dugout that 
will include lockers and showers. 
Batting cages and a bullpen area 
will be added on as well. 

The stadium will feature 
reserved parking for coaches, offi-
cials and VIPs attending the game. 

'vVhen games aren 't going on, 
the field will still be maintained 
courtesy of a field maintenance 
equipment roo 111 located on-site. 

The baseball coaches will also 
have offices and storage pace 
available at the park instead of 

having to share the Canyonview 
Athletic Complex with the water-
polo and swi mming and diving 
coaches as they currently have to 
do. 

'vVhen the dust clears, UCSD 
will be home to one of the top 
baseball parks in Division II ath-
letics, something this campus 
should be very proud of. 

According to Edwards, this 
campus may not have to wait long 
to feel that pride. 

"My major focus this year will 
be leading a successful capital 
campaign," Edwards said. "In the 
numerous meetings we have 
already had with key members of 
the community, I have been 
impressed by their desire to sup-
port what we represent in UC D 
athletics. I believe there are many 
people and corporations who are 
eager to align themselves with a 
collegiate ath letic program that 
puts the welfare of the students 
first, but maintains a very high 
level of success."

contribution to the campaign

Stoner: 
Jordan shouldn't have 
come back to the NBA 
Continued from page 24 
never read any of my columns 
before, I will review the reasons I 
don't thi nk Jordan should return. 

First of all, there's one valid 
argument in favor of Jordan's 
return that I cannot deny: the ben-
efit he gains by being forced to sell 
his stock in the Wizards, one of the 
worst teams in the league last year. 
That's worth coming out of retire-
ment for. 

But honestly, as much as I love 
watching Jordan play basketball , I 
believe it's against his best interests 
to return to the NBA. 

First of all, there's no question 
that he's older and slower than 
when he played for the Bulls. He 
already suffered back spasms and 
knee tendinitis trying to get back 
into hape last summer, not to 
mention being out of commission 
for fou r weeks after sustaining twO 
cracked ribs in a pickup game. All 
this was just during the summer! 
Who knows what'll happen during 
a grueling 82-gamc schedule 
against younger, quicker oppo-
nents. What if he gets injured and 
is forced to end h.is career for good, 
while on the disabled list? I think 
that would be a terrible injustice to 
a legend who could have ended his 
career with the game-winning shor 
to earn IUs sixth NBA champi-
onship. 

econd, there's the possibiliry 
that he si mply cannot compete 
with the younger stars in the BA. 
You know Kobe Bryant, Allen 
Iverson, Vince Carter and compa-
ny \vill be po itively sa livaong for a 
chance to show Jordan up and 
claim the title of "the next Michael 
Jordan." I wish Jordan the best of 
luck against those punks. but what 
if he simply cannot play at their 
level ) I fear what the realization of 
this, if it occurs, would do to his 
competitive heart. 

But forger the individual com-
petition for a iec; how is Jordan 
going to be able to handle playing 
on a team that's mediocre at best) 
The Wizards are in a rebuilding 
stage right now (which was partly 
Jordan's work when he was the 
team's chief executi~e officer) ami 
could only make the playoffs with 
the aid of some sort of miracle. 

I want Jordan to be that mira -
cle, I really do. But I'm afraid he 
won't be. I'm afraid that my IJ t 
memories of this champion will 
be of him as a loser, whi ch is not 
how one hould remember the 
greatest basketball player of all 
time. 

He will be playing witll some 
very young players, including 
Kwame Brown, the No. I pick in 
the draft la t June. How will they 
respond to him? Jordan has said 
that he feels this will be a good way 
to help develop and teach the 
Wizards ' immature players, but he 
doesn't have to play to teach. He 
could fire Doug Collins, the coach 
he hired, and take over the 
Wizards himself. Jordan will be 
doing most of the coaching any-
way - do you really think Collins 
is going to try to tell His Airness 
what to do out there on the bas-
ketball court? 

But what if Jordan drives these 
fragile rookies tOQ..hard the way he 
did with previous teammates who 
left for other teams or even quit 
basketball? 

Anyone reading back through 
this article will notice that there are 
a lot of questions. I won't deny that 
I'm excited about seeing Jordan 
back in action again, and if he does 
manage to perform a miracle with 
the Wizards, I will happily eat my 
words. 

But he has so much to lose. Any 
smudge, smear, or tarnish tha't 
could occur to Jordan's legend 
would reduce the legacy of the 
greatest basketball players and ath-
letes of all time. I, for one, want to 
remember Jordan as a winner, not 
as a loser.

Women's soccer continues on a roll 
Tritons pick up another victory to stay atop the CCAA 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team pounded visiting California 
State Universtiy, Los Angeles 4-0 
to win its second straight shutout 
game Sept. 23 at Triton Soccer 
Stadium. 

This was the Tri tons' third-
consecutive win after losing their 
first of the season over a week ago 
against San Francisco State. The 
loss had napped a remarkable 22-
game winning streak. UCSD now 

. looks poised to begin a new streak. 
Triton goalies - sophomore 

Kami Poma and freshman Jamie 
Lautenschleger - each had three 
saves and helped to ensure 
UCSD's victory. 

Senior Erika Alfredson put 
UCSD on the board first, scoring 
off an excellent pass from team-
mate Julia Cuder at the 27:55 
mark in the first half. 

Alfredson struck again 55:53 
_ into the game off of a rebound 

froll} Elizabeth Hughes' shot. 
Sophomore Kristin Jones tacked 
on the third -,,'i ton goal with a 
breakaway run set up by a pass 
from Laura Dooly. 

Freshman BriOli Wenck closed 
out the scoring for UCSD by head-
ing in a Christine Wensel comer 
kick with a minute left in the game. 

Golden Eagle goalie Alicia 
Parkhouse was tormen ted by the 
Tritons all day as they outshot Cal 
State L.A. 19-8. Parkhouse fin-
ished the game with seven saves. 

TIle Tritons also controlled the 
ball for the majoriry of the game 
and posted six corner kicks to zero 
by Cal Sta te L.A. 

GuorOOn rtle photo 

Laying out: UCSD's Erika Alfredson goes down while fighting for a loose ball during a match last year. She led the 
national championship team in goals during her junior season and returns as a senior, looking for another title. 

UCSD has an am.lung .200 
shot percentage so far this season. 
The Tritons average 16.7 shots 
an'd 3.3 goals per game - the 
most in the league. 

The Tritons, ranked sixth after 

a loss last week to San Francisco 
State, improved to 8-1 overall and 
6.1 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association 

The Golden Eagles remain 
winless in league with a 0-6- 1 

record and are 2-7-1 overall. 
The Tritons will next face UC 

Davis in league action at home, 
ept. 28 at 7 p.m. 

UCSD then plays hico State 
on Sunday at 12:30 p.m.

The UCSO men 's soccer team 
overcame its ea rl y season woes 
Sunday afternoon with a solid 2- 1 
h9me victo ry over Ca liforn ia 
Collegiate Athletic Association riva l 
Californ ia State University Los 
Angeles. 

The Tritons, who are 2-5 in the 
CCAA and 2-7 overall, held off a late 
surge from the Golden Eagles to pre-
serve the victory. 

Defense dominated the first half. 
UCSD goalkeeper Ryan Weirich 
stopped seven shots throughout the 
game. Cal State L.A. goalie Scott 
Mazurier, however, was only able to 
save five shots . 

The Tri tons turned qn the pres-
sure late in the first half and got a goal 
from junior team captain Kris Chi les. 
Chiles got the ball just outside the 
penalty area and placed a shot into 
the corner of the goal, beating 
Mazurier and givi ng UCSD a 1-0 
lead. 

With barely six minutes left in the 
game, Marc Salomon fircd a free kick 
into the Golden Eagles' goa l. 
Mazurier stopped the shot, but mis-
handled it. Luckily, Triton sophomore 

can ummers was right there to put 
the ball - and the gal11e - away.

Last Tuesday, he signed a twO-
