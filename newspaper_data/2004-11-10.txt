State may begin paying 
for full summer quarter 

By MYRICK AWN 
Senior Staff Writer 

California officials are cur-
rently considering whether to 
offer state funding for UCSD's 
summer session in order to pro-
vide more student services, 
according to UC Office of the 
President spokeswoman Ravi 
Poorsina. 

"In 2001, UCLA, UC Santa 
Barbara and Berkeley started phas-
ing in state funds," Poorsina said. 
"In 2002, Davis started and by 
2006, if everything goes well, all 
campuses will receive state funding 
for summer sessions." 

Currently, UCSD's summer 
instruction is offered as an inde-
pendent session without the state 
funding that the university 

receives for the fall, winter and 
spring quarters. However, in the 
coming week, the UC Office of 
the President will offer its pro-
posed budget to th~ UC Board of 
Regents, which includes state 
funding for summer sessions at all 
remaining campuses, according to 
Poorsina. 

In .response to these discus-
sions on the state level, UCSD 
Director of Summer Sessions 
Becky Arce has begun meeting 
with Office of Academic Affairs 
members. 

Among the items being dis-
cussed are the types of courses 
and number of services that would 
be offered by the university. 
According to Arce, state funding

.A.S. to file eledion complaints 
By ALESSANDRA IADICAn 

. Staff Writer 

In response to long lines and 
delays at campus voting sites in 
the Nov. 2 election, A.S. offi-
cers are preparing complaints 
to the San Diego County Office 
of the Registrar and the 
California secretary of state to 
urge organizational reforms in 
future elections. 

"There were a lot of prob-
lems with the election day," A.S. 
Vice President External Rigo 
Marquez said. 

A.S. President Jeon Pae also 
said that there were issues with 
the setup of polling sites, calling 
the situation "unacceptable." 

Both blame the Office of the 
Registrar for most of the prob-
lems. Marquez said the office 
was first unhelpful over the sum-
mer, when he submitted materi-
als for newly registered voters. 

"They were just like, 'You just 
gave me a lot of work to do,'" 
Marquez said. "San Diego in 
general was not prepared." 

County Registrar Sally 
McPherson cited "big registra-
tion drives at the last minute" as 
the reason for the long waits on 
Nov. 2. According to Pae, 
UCSD reached its goal of regis-
tering 3,000 new voters. 

McPherson also said too 
many students voted outside of 
their own precincts. 

"[There were] a lot of provi-
sional voters," McPherson said. 
"[provisional ballots] take a long 
time to process." 

However, Marquez said that 
students who voted out of their 
precincts should not necessarily

ballots at the Muir Commons voting site during the Nov. 2 presidential election. 
have been given provisional bal-
lots. Instead, poll workers should 
have told students to go to the 
correct precinct, according to 
Marquez. 

"For a poll worker, the easiest 
answer is to give them a provi-
sional ballot,'" Marquez said. 
"[But] we really discourage stu-
dents from [casting provisional 
ballots]." 

Student organizers were also 
angry at the way the registrar's 
office responded to the large 
crowds. McPherson said that she 
arranged to send more polling 
booths and ballots, but, accord-
ing to Marquez, the registrar's 
office only doubled the amount 
of booths at each site from the 
initial five to 10, which was not 
adequate enough to make the 
lines move faster. 

"It just won't happen again," 
Marquez said. "Jeon [pae] and I 
are both writing letters to the 
San Diego registrar's office and 

to the secretary of state [to say] 
how disappointed we were." 

Pae said that, in the future, 
students organizers will try to 
arrange for polling to take place 
at one location on campus, 
where lines will be divided by 
precinct. She and Marquez both 
said that they want to ensure that 
poll workers are UCSD stu-
dents. 

"Having students be the poll 
workers - be the overseers - is . 
going to be a lot more helpful," 
Marquez said. 

Marquez said that future 
elections will also be less hectic 
because the number of expected 
voters will be better calculated. 

"In the past, we haven't had 
many students come out and 
vote, so two polling places suf-
ficed," Marquez said. "[Now the 
registrar's office] realizes that 
students are voting."

Many students unprepared 

for college, Aa says 
Only 22 percent - or 1.2 million - of hiRh 

school graduates who took the AG 
Assessment in 2004 received scores that indi-
cated they were ready for college-level En~ish, 
math and science, a new report from the test-
ing company said. 

Of all AG-tested students who graduated 
last spring. only 26 percent achieved scores 
indicating they could eam a 'C' or better in their 
first biology dass, and only 40 percent scored 
hiRh enough to receive at least a 'C' in their first 
college algebra class. Additional results from dif-
ferent AG assessments administered to eighth 
and 10th graders suggest that students Who 
graduate in 2006 and 2008 will be no better 
prepared for college, the report stated. 

The company has called on high schools in 
the nation to strengthen core curriculum 
requirements to "improve students' readiness" 
for college and jobs~ In addition, it urged '~up­
portlVe', Intervention for students who fall to 
leam through traditional methods. 

The problem, AG Chief Executive Officer 
Richard L. Ferguson stated, "can't be solved 
ovemight' though immediate action must be 
taken. 

The company also suggested that a group 
of what it calls 'Courses for Success' - includ-
ing traditional science and advanced math 
dasses - could impact student performance 
and college readiness. 

Survey; Some grads unaware 
of loan consolidation 

Almost half of all students who graduate 
from four-year institutions are unaware of a 
Federal Loan Consolidation Program that may 
save them money, and only one-third actually 
consolidate their loans, a new survey by the 
Collegiate Funding Services has found. 

Only 41 percent said they were aware of the 
Federal Consolidation Loan Program, which 
enables student borrowers to combine their 
federal student debt into a sin~e, fixed interest 
rate with extended repayment terms that can 
potentially cut students' monthly payments by 
half. 

In addition, despite historically low interest 
rates that make loan consolidation a financially 
attractive option, only 35 percent of recent 
graduates have used the opportunity, the com-
pany found. For some, it may mean losing an 
additional 0.6 percent reduction in their interest 
rate that students receive when they consoli-
date during the six-month period before their 
first payments are due. 

More than half of recent graduates had not

Students aeate program 
based on NBC's 'Apprentice' 

Student govemment leaders from a com-
munity college system in Aorida have begun an " 
eiRht-week competition based on the NBC hit 
terevision series 'The Apprentice.' Instead of an 
opportunity to work with New York tycoon 
Donald Trump, however, participating students 
win a semester~ong intemship with a local 
mayor. 

Like in the show, participants in 'The 
lntem" are split into two teams and assigned 
a series of tasks to demonstrate their 
"resourcefulness, creativity and critical-think-
ing skills: according to a statement from the 
organizers. One contestant is eliminated at 
the end of every week and is told by the 
mayor to "Stay in school!" 

The original show uses the catch phrase, 
"You're fired!' 

Though the television series involves corpo-
rate assignments, the tasks in the college con-
test are more 'community-oriented: involving 
the improvement of local parks, housing con-
struction with Habitat for Humanity and enter-
tainment of young cancer patients. 

The students originally came up with the 
competition while watching 'The Apprentice: 
student government member and contest 
organizer Ray-Scott Miller stated. 

Chemists aeate 'cha~ 
to direct nanoparticles 

Researchers at UCSD have used tiny dust-
sized silicone microchips to surround and direct 
the motion of molecules, cells, bacteria and 
other tiny objects suspended in drops of liquid, 
the university announced. . 

Their development of the small silicon 
'chaperones: described in the forthcoming 
issue of tlY: joumal Nature Materials, may 
some day be used to detect and surround 
objects like drops of toxic chemicals and cancer 
cells, chemistTy and biochemistry professor 
Michael Sailor said. 

In addition, the new technology may be 
useful in industrial "microfluidic processes' -
used in the assembly and movement of tiny 
liquid partides - and could eliminate the need 
for pumps, valves and pipettes.

Summer: A.S. Council mulls

would not take the decision-making power 
out of UCSD's hands. 

"The how, when and where - it~ all 
going to be done at the campus level," Arce 
said. 

In its meeting on Nov. 3, the A.S. 
Council discussed the possibility of receiv-
ing state funding and debated what services 
the council should provide to students 
attending summer sessions. At the meeting, 

" 

approved of offering programming events 
like concerts. 

In order to pay for these services, a 
majority of the council informally agreed 
that a student activity fee should be col-
lected from summer quarter students, 
though no vote was taken. A $21 student 
activity fee is currently collected from 
every registered student every quarter 
excluding summer. 

"I think services such as A.S . Lecture 
A.S. PresidentJenn Pae said 
that the arrival of state 
funding made it a possibility 
for UCSD to combine its 
summer sessions into a tra-
ditional 10-week quarter. 
Though the university has 
not discussed this possibili-
ty, according to Arce, the 
councilmembers weighed in 
on the option.

Notes should be open, and 
we . need to charge for 
them," John Muir College 
Junior Senator Neil Spears 
said. "But because we can-

Other members, howev-
er, said they thought that 
programming was not 
needed during the summer 
session. In the Nov. 3 
meeting, Revelle College 
Junior Senator Kelly 

"State funding would be 
more advantageous to the 
students because with state 
funding comes better ser-
vices, It Song said. "But I haven't decided yet 
on the 10-week quarter. " 

With state funding, university services, 
including the university shuttles, would be 
provided during the summer, according to 
Arce. Additionally, most members of the 
council said that Associated Students should 
provide some academic services, such as A.S. 
Lecture Notes. Some, including A.S. Vice 
President External Rigo Marquez, also 

Vasant said that the sum-
mer session was not lacking in program-
ming because programming mostly affects 
students living on campus. During the 
summer sessions, on-campus housing avail-
able to students is limited because the uni-
versity rents much of it to camps and other 
unaffiliated groups.

Funds: Gap to fall by half in 2005, Song says 
continued from page I 

23,050, the universi ty has 23,675 
full-time undergraduate and gtadu-
ate students, according to Song. 

State funds allocated for each 
student is "worldoad money" and 
largely finances the cost of instruc-
tion, according to Associate Vice 
Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Education and EPC Chair Mark 
Appelbaum. 

"The overenrollment rate is 
larger than we usually see, but isn't 
a huge crisis when you consider the 
reduced budget we had to work 
with," Appelbaum said. "When you 
consider the whole picture, the 
predictions are amazingly close." 

Generally, the campus should 
remain within 5 percent of the 
original estimate, Appelbaum said. 
However, underenrollment is a 
more serious problem for universi-
ty finances. 

"Of course we'd like to be on tar-
get all the time," Appelbaum said. 
"But at least if you are overenrolled, 
funding is possible by the state if 
there is money available later. If you 
don't make enrollment, however, 
you ~ve to pay back [state money 
budgeted to the university)." 

While the state does not cur-
rently budget funds to reimburse 
the campus for the extra students, it 
does allocate more money during 
the year if possible, according to 
Appelbaum. 

"If state funds allow it and they're 
able to increase our budget for more 
students, we'll receive more money 
for overenrollment," he said. 

At this point, that extra funding 
is uncenain because of state bud-
getary problems, according to 
Appelbaum. 

Fortunately, the university is 
able to use extra money from other 
campuses that are currently under-
enrolled to fund UCSD, according 
to Director of Analytical Studies 

Judith O'Boyle. 
Statistical models created by 

institutional research departments, 
including Campus Planning, predict 
student enrollment, Appelbaum 
said. The department takes into 
account the number of freshmen and 
transfer students when making esti-
mates. However, roughly three-
founhs of the projections rely on 
returning and continuing students, 
which are hard variables to predict, 
according to O'BoyIe. 

"There are a lot of different 
things that cause students to gradu-
ate earlier or later," O'Boyie said, 

" If the campus over, 
enrolls, we are still going 
to meet our commitment 

to house all eligible 
students. "

citing factors like tuition fees and 
employment conditions. 

Administrators expect 80 addi-
tional students to be added to the 
enrollment roster during the 
upcoming winter quarter under the 
Guaranteed Transfer Option, Song 
said. This option offers university 
admission to students initially 
referred to community colleges. 
Incoming GTO students are cur-
rently not included in the 3.3 per-
I;ent overenrol1ment figure, 
according to Song. . 

"[Overenrollment) means we 
have to stretch the money as much 
as we can," he said. 

While overenrollment affects 

things like university class sizes, it 
does not impact university housing, 
according to Appelbaum. 

However, this year~ overenroll-
ment will not severely affect class 
sizes, according to O'Boyle. 

"Because there are extra spaces 
in classes, the additional 700 or so 
students we are above target doesn't 
really make a difference in class-
rooms," she said. 

All eligible students have also 
received housing on campus. 

"All freshmen who meet all the 
required deadlines are guaranteed 
on-campus housing and also receive 
a two-year guarantee of housing," 
Housing and Dining Services 
Director Mark Cunningham said. 

According to Cunningham, his 
department not only bases housing 
plans on university projections of 
enrollment but also takes into 
account overenroUment. 

"u the campus overenrolls, we 
are still going to meet our commit-
ment to house all eligible students," 
he said. 

Unfonunately, unexpected num-
bers of students create a problem in 
the availability of beds, which forces 
the department to house students in 
temporarily "tripled" rooms, 
according to Cunningham. 

However, UCSD's tripling rate 
is less than that of other UC cam-
puses, Cunningham said. 

"We opened this year with just 
over 100 triples across our program, 
which is a very small number com-
pared to [UCLA) or ruC Berkeley)," 
he said. "But our goal is to not have 
to triple any students unless we 
absolutely have no other option." 

While the overenrollment rate 
still stands at 3.3 percent, Song said 
that the cornrnittee expects the per-
centage to be cut in half next year.

R~gistrar to blame for 
voting complications 

I nstead of blaming increased student inter· 
est in electoral politics, 

it's time for San Diego 
Registrar Sally McPherson 
to hold herself accountable 
to taxpayers for failing to 
perform her duties on 
Election Day. 

McPherson has gone as 
far as to blame A.S. leaders 
for carrying out a "last· 
minute" voter registration 
drive for the delays and 
poor organization that 
caused many students to 
cool their heels on Nov. 2 
as they waited to vote. 

The timing of the A.S. 
registration push and the 
excessive use of provisional 
ballots by students voting 
in wrong precincts were ~he 
causes of campus votmg 
complications, according to 
McPherson. 

However, McPherson 
must accept the responsi-
bility for her office, which 
fell far short in the process· 
ing of new voter registra· 

tion forms, instead of criti-
cizing student organizers; 
they should be commended 
for attempting to increase 
voter turnout among the 
most politically apathetic 
voting bloc. . 

Since all of the newly 
registered students met the 
state deadline, they were 
entitled to participate in the 
presidential election. That 
their ability to do so was 
hampered because the reg· 
istrat had not planned on 
such an enthusiastic 
turnout surely is not the 
fault of students or their 
elected campus govern· 
ment. 

Had McPherson provid· 
ed election packets in a 
timely manner - many 
students didn't receive their 
sample ballots at all - and 
actually sent students the 
location of their polling 
sites, as she is reqwred to 
do by law, mucn of the 
chaos could have been 
averted. 

Outreach funding more 
important than ever 

When voters passed Proposition 209 in 1996, they spoke, 
saying that race shoulo not 
be a factor in college admis· 
sions. Yet whatever your 
stance on affinnative action, 
it shouldn't be hard to rec-
ognize the fundamental 
inequities in our K-12 edu· 
cational system that make it 
harder for underrepresented 
minorities to achieve eligi-
bility for the University of 
California; these inequities 
have only become more 
apparent for black and 
Latino students since affir· 
mative action was barred, as 
recent reports have indicat· 
ed. 

As a result, the university 
should do what it can to 
level the playing field for 
those not lucky enough to 
attend the LynbrookS and 
the Arcadias of the 
California public school 
system. University outreach 
programs, whose budgets 
have been cut yet again, are 

one of the university's only 
means of affecting. the stu· 
dents it will hopefully admit 
~ne day. As ~ pu~lic institu· 
nOh, the uruverslty and the 
state government that funds 
it have an obligation to give 
everyone an equal opportu· 
nity to attend college. 

Granted, K·12 ei:lucation 
is the root of the problem, 
and there's only so much 
outreach programs can do 
to fundamentally improve 
the quality of education. 
Nonetheless, they can be a 
cost· effective means of 
bridging the gap until 
California's K·12 system -
now among the worst in the 
country - can be 
revamped. In the meantime, 
by educating students on 
how to gain eligibili!y for 
the University of Cali fomi a, 
outreach programs can 
allow any qualified students 
under the system to take full 
advantage of California's 
world-class higher educa· 
tion system.

Students, beware of media 
By •• IAHUIGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

If you had the exquisite bad 
luck to be awake somewhere in 
the Gary Cooper hours of Nov. 2, 
you might have heard a terrible 
rumbling sound in your neigh-
borhood - the sound of approxi-
mately 54.S million souls explod-
ing slightly after NBC~ bloated 
election-map of Ohio turned red. 
In such a contested election in a 
polarized nation, this sentiment is 
quite understandable. What IS not 
understandable, however, is how a 
majority of America's newspeople 
joined this segment of the popu-
lation by either giving the elec-
tion the finger or sharing a tear 
with Democrats nationwide. Yes 
sir, hindsight may be 20-20, but it 
takes the post-mortem of the 
Democratic party for us to realize 
that Americans had been watch-
ing their televisions through the 
liberal-colored glasses of their 
anchors and reporters. 

Nowhere is television news' lib-
eral bias more evident than in the 
exit polls conducted by these orga-
nizations. Polls conducted by 
CNN and CBS showed Kerry with 
a solid lead in the so-called "battle-
ground" states, including Ohio. 
But when the actual vote counts 
came in, the discrepancy between 
these polls and reality were so 
embarrassing that the folks at 
CNN actually changed their data 
in me middle of the night to avoid 
looking like total goons. So why 
were these "reputable" news orga-
nizations so wrong? Like all other 

"facts" thrown around by both 
sides throughout the last few 
months, me data collected tends to 
support whatever conclusion the 
researchers wish to 6nd. 

A recent study by researchers 
11m Groserclose at UCLA and 
Jeff Milyo at the University of 
Chicago yielded similar results-
yet, unlike the news agencies they 
studied, Groserclose and Milyo 
looked across the board for their 
research. The secret to media bias, 
these researchers argue, lies in the 
think tanks news organizations use 
for their supporting facts in news 
stories. By assigning members of 
Congress "liberal percentage 
scores" based on their voting 
record, and then correlating these 
scores for the thi nk tanks these 
representatives cited in their 
speeches, Groserclose and Milyo 
could gauge the bias of a. news 
organization based on whether it 
chose its facts from "liberal" or 
"conservative" sources. Their 
findings? When a median liberal 
value could be seen as 39 percent, 
most 1V news oudets were well 
above the SO percent range. 
Looking at these numbers, it 
comes as no surprise that CBS 
anchor Dan Rather came under 
fire in the months before the elec-
tion for broadcasting falsi6ed doc· 
uments relating to President 
George W Bush's military record_ 
Of course, this study also justified 
Democrats' criticisms of Fox 
News: "Fox News Special Report"-
scored a 27 percent, showing itk 
just as off-center as NBC or ABC 
are in the opposite direction. 

For college students and other 
disillusioned types, though, the 
trusted source for news during the 
past months was Comedy 
Central's "The Daily. Show." 
Loyal viewers who consider them-
selves political junkies could claim 
that Jon Stewart mocked 
Democrats and Republicans 
equally, meanwhile having a good 
laugh at the electoral process that 
slowly drove our nation apart. 
With "The Daily Show," hind-
sight proves illuminating as well: 
The day after the election, 
Stewart completely lost all his 
credibility by engaging in 30 min-
utes of television that placed "The 
Daily Show~ in a position of par-
tisan hackery second only to talk 
radio. Instead of the usual biparti-
san mockery, viewers were treated 
to several angry, unfunny mono-
logues berating "middle America" 
as uneducated, and mentioning 
that the Republican voting effort 
was entirely due to voters' "icki-
ness around two dudes kissing." 
To use his own words against him, 
Stewartk postelection coverage is 
quite possibly "bad for America." 

But even if the "serious" media 
has followed Stewart into the 
depths of liberality, who cares' 
After all, national, polls have found 
that "educated people" tend to be 
more left-leaning, so why should-
n't the "educated" media follow 
suit? This faulty reasoning is sim-
ilar to the mentality behind our 
media's Ii~al fact--choosing, 104

'ftDNI!SDAY, NOVEMBER 10, ZOO4 THE UCSDOUARDIAN OPINION S 

Local festival outshines presidential elections Media: 
'Newshour' 

provides 
balanced look 

Lost in 
Translation 

Daniel watts 

S of the Sun God festival. Add a high school homecoming queen, elected beauty-
pageant style. Subtract Sun God's 
large-scale public drunkenness. 
Add the public drunkenness of a 
guy in a Pikachu costume. Throw 
in some pro-wrestling re.enact-
ments, poorly imitated Mexican 
food and a bunch of nearly naked 
men banging on a la-foot drum, 
and you've got the Shirokane 
Festival at Meiji Gakuin 
University. 

We get a week off school for 
this crazy thing. If only UCSD 
got the same privileges for Sun 
God. Too bad we can't get our fes-
tival to coincide with spring break; 
that would really bring in the 
crowds. San Diego could rival 
South Florida as a college spring 
break. destination, pump up the 
local economy and bring many 
beautiful people to UCSD. 

Just as UCSD sometimes 
books festival bands who no one's 
heard of, who no one likes, or who 
stopped being cool in 1996, the ' 
Shirokane festival booked some 
supposedly famous come'dian 
whom everyone despised. Just like 
at UCSD, a huge crowd gathered 
to watch this hated man. As one 
student exp1ained, "He is a very 
famous comedian, allover Japan .. 
He is on 1V all the time. But he is 
not funny." The comedian was 
Carrot Top. 

I visited the festival on Nov. 3, 
Japan-time - Election Day back 

in the United States. I relied on 
e·ma.il updates from mends in 
America and the crappy Web 
browser on my mobile phone to 
keep track of the polls. No one 
around seemed even vaguely 
interested in the election, and 
neither did many of my Japanese 
friends I spoke with afterward. 
Only a couple people knew that 
the United States was holding an 
election on Nov. 2. Those who 
cared about the outcome univer· 
sally supported Kerry, but only 
because he was the only non-
Bush candidate that they had 
heard was running. Of the stu-
dents who knew about the elec-
tion, none were more than mildly 
concerned about the result. The 
anecdotal political apathy of 
Japanese youth that I noticed 
when I first arrived, which is con-
firmed independently through 
their dismal voting habits and 
political partici pation, was con-
firmed again by their indifference 
toward this election. 

The lack of outlets for political 
expression might contribute to 
this apathy. There are no campus 
political clubs and there is no stu-
dent government at this school. 
The only thing they vote for is 
the "Stairway to Queen" beauty 
pageant at the Shirokane Festival, 
and they vote on that based on 
who can cook hamburgers the 
fastest - I am not making this up. 
The only student newspaper is a 
one·page, photocopied sheet of 
paper call'Cd "MISH Weekly," 
produced entirely by one student 
from UC Santa Cruz. That paper 
is censored, and has to pass 
muster in the eyes of. the 
hlternational Center's adminis-
trator before access to the photo-
copy machine is granted. A story 
about professors on sick leave was 

almost cut for being "too nega-
tive." 

There is a national obsession 
with "saving face" that has been 
lon, documented in history 
boob and journals about 
Japanese society. For example, I 
was playing voUeyball with eight 
Japanese friends yesterday, and 
we had to pick teams. They are 
completely unfamiliar with the 
concept of "First captain! 
Second captain!" Picking teams 
makes me noStalgic for my ele-
mentary school back in San Jose, 
but the bottom line is that some 
poor soul will always be picked 
last. We picked teams here by 
thrusting out our hands on the 
count of three either in the form 
of a fist or open palm; open palms 
on one team, fists on the other. 
The random selection avoids the 
awkwardness of choosing individ-
ual players, but also makes 
unevenly matched teams a possi-
bility. One team could wallop the 
other, as happened in our case, 
when most of the good players 
were randomly grouped together. 
I guess it's better to face group 
humiliation than individual 
shame. 

Saving face also applies to 
interactions with one's superiors 
in Japan, be they the elderly, 
senior club members, or profes· 
sors. The students allow profes-
sors to get away with extraordi· 
nary bias, and sometimes out-
right academic dishonesty, 
because they do not want to make 
them lose face. 

I sat in on an "English lan-
guage~ class where the admitted-
ly socialist professor - a man 
from Pennsylvania - had the 
class listen to a CD of speeches 
delivered by Howard Zinn and 
Noam Chomsky at socialist ral-

lies. The students-fill in blanks in 
a transcript to help them with 
their "vocabulary." I'm sure "mil-
itary-industrial complex" and 
"capitalist machinations of 
oppression" will come in handy 
during conversational English. 
Every studeut hates the class and 
realizes that they are listening to 
propaganda, but only one has 
bothered to complain: a Japanese 
girl who attended British school 
in Singapore for eight years. 
When she talked to the dean last 
semester, the professor was 
forced to change the format of 
his class. This semester, he's back 
at it again. 

Students have no real outlet to 
complain. If classes like that were 
taught in California, the media 
outlets would swoop down on 
them like those chickens in Zelda 
swoop down on Link if he beats 
them with his sword. Maybe if the 
student newspaper - oh wait, 
there's no student newspaper. Or 
the student-run television -
oops, no SRTY. There's always 
the radio - no, none of that 
either. Hopefully this class will 
inspire these students to get 
active. They should be thankful 
that they have a professor so bad 
that he leaves in the middle of 
class to drink in the hallway after 
pressing play on the CD player. 
Even if they end up accepting the 
propaganda, at least they'll have 
an opinion. People don't protest 
unless there's something to 
protest against - and the students 
in Japan have plenty to protest.

purveyors of objective faCt. To put it 
blundy: Who cares if CBS or NBC 
makes its liberal audience happy, if 
the content it is broadcasting is 
false? CNN made its audience 
happy by hinting that Kerry would 
win the election, but it was still 
wrong. This problem may have 
something to do with the viewing 
public, ' which by and large no 
longer watche~ the news to form 
opinions, but rather to validate 
them. In this distrusting climate of 
opinions, the least televised news 
could do is attempt to present both 
sides equally 'so the Democrats 
don't start to believe that the major-
ity of the American people agrees 
with their views. 

Conservatives learned well 
before the election not to trust the 
biased media, but it is now, after the 
election, that the liberals must heed 
the same warning: Be wary of any-
thing touted as "fact" on any news 
program. Do not have faith in any 
agency or news program that 
claims to gauge public opinion. If 
you must watch television news to 
be informed, add Fox News to bal-
ance out your favorite liberal sta-
tion and try to get a decent picture, 
or watch PBS' "Newshour," which 
the study found to be only 2-per-
cent liberal. If we, the American 
people, all do what we can to dis-
trust the news, there is a chance 
that in four years we might not 
have to put up with this shady par-
tisan hackery, and we might have a 
chance to actually know what is 
going on in this country before it's 
too late.

'underage' sex Workers 
Editor. 

I would like to know precisely 
what "underserved sub-popula-
tions that will be targeted in [the 
Southern California Border 
IllY/AIDS Project) are youth sex 
workers" actually means ["Counsel 
threatens legal action against 
activist site," Nov. I). 

I just happen to know the cur-
rent views of the Bush administra-
ti<;ln on the topic of children being 
offered condoms in response to 
attaclcs by pedophiles, etc. It came 
up just a few days ago; it has not 
changed. 

Your article spealcs of the efforts 
of one of our movement's heroes, 
professor Donna Hughes of the 
University of Rhode Island, to pub-
licly expose operations at the infa-
mous Svay Pak, Cambodia brothel 
park. There. nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs) worked col-
laboratively with brothel owners to 
engage in such efforts as teaching 
six-year-old girls how to say "please 
wear a condom" in English. 
Japanese and German. When asked 
whether they had any responsibility 
to blow the whistle on the enslavers 
of 6-year-old "sex workers," the 
NGO leaders made clear that they 
did not. In country after country, 
some publicly funded NGOs angrily 
rejected suggestions that they should 
be asked to jeopardize their close 
relations with brothel owners and 
traffickers by taking any steps that 
the latter might deem hostile. 

That has also been the consis-
tent view of President George W. 
Bush. One of the major challenges 
we face today is public money 
being given directly or indirectly to 
criminal gangs who are involved in 
slavery and pedophile crimes. 

Would it be possible for the 
UCSD Center for Community 

Health to generate an "on [he 
record" definition of "under-
served sub-populations that will 
be targeted in [the Southern 
California Border HIV/AIDS 
Project)? 

Child "prostitutes" do not need 
to be taught how to use condoms. 
They need to be rescued from the 
sex predators and pedophiles who 
are killing them. That is the civi-
lized view in our opinion. There is 
no such thing as an "underage" sex 
worker. The concept is a legal fic-
tion in California .

Youth: T umout highest in more than 30 years 
continutd from pagt I 

power students have as a collective 
voice and the impact we have in the 
community. " 

According to Pae, the UC 
Student Association registered 
30,000 students, surpassing its goal 
of 2S,000. Similarly, UCSD stu-
dent organizers met their goal of 
registering over 3,000 students. 

"Young people felt more invest-
ed and a part of the political 
process," California Public Interest 
Research Group campus organizer 
Kathryn Cohen said. "Voting is 
now part of a social movement to 
improve the present state of our 
nation. I think people of all ages 
felt invested in the issues at stake, 
such as the war on Iraq, and more 
invested in America's impact inter-
nationally and domestically." 

Pae also attributed the local 
turnout to efforts mobilizing stu-
dents on- and off-campus to become 
engaged in the poli tical process. 

"The coalition of San 

Diego universities and colleges 
played a huge role and a large 
impact on the local elections," Pae 
said. "In addition, the coalition' of 
UCSD students and organizations 
encouraged voter registration, edu-
cation and getting out the vote all 
across campus. We helped to pro-
vide the forum for a nonpartisan 
space, whether that was through 
resources or monetary contribu-
tions to get students involved." 

Though 82 percent of UC stu-
dents and 76 percent of UCSD sru-
dents voted for Sen. John Kerry 
(D-Mass.) for president, according 
to a joint poll of more than 1,800 
voters by student newspapers, 
UCSD sociology professor 
Rebecca Klatch said she didn't 
think the srudents' likely disap-
pointment over Kerry's loss would 
make them stay away from future 
elections. Instead, increased 
turnout might be more than just a 
temporary phenomenon, she said. 

"Young people tend to be more 

idealistic, but I have an instinct that 
young people will continue to be 
engaged [in the future)," Klatch 
said. "It is important to remember 
the election was not a landslide, 
and it was not hopeless." 

Cohen said it is essential for vot-
ers not to be discouraged by poll 
problems or their candidate's losses. 

"While some students I talked to 
were upset over the long lines and 
registration system, I think it is 
essential that students know their 
vote truly did matter in the last elec-
tion," Cohen said. "Regardless of 
whether their particular candidate 
was elected, or the proposition they 
were really invested in passed, the 
increase in the youth voter turnout 
in the last election will put the issues 
that are important to the 18-t0-24-
year-old bracket, such as financial 
aid, education and health care, on 
the next administrations agenda."

McPherson also said there 
would be changes at the next elec-
tion as a result of high voter 
turnout on Nov. 2. 

"[We'll take voter turnout] into 
consideration when allocating 
resources at the next election," 
McPherson said. 

Under California state law there 
must be one polling site for every 
1,2 SO registere~ voters, according 
to McPherson. 

The deadline to request a 
polling site for a precinct is 88 days 
before the election. The only way 
to change the number of polling 
locations is if there is a change in 
population of the county, not regis-

tered voters, said Caren Daniels-
Meade, a spokeswoman for the sec-
retary of state's office. 

She also said that the situation 
at UCSD was not unique. 

"Across the country, it was a very 
high-turnout election, " McPherson 
said. "[College) campuses [were] 
most affected because of the large 
number of provisional ballots."

While the long lines were 
inconvenient for students, the

they pass constitutional muster, 
according to UC Davis Jaw profes-

"Some law professors believe 
that unequally long lines in differ-
ent places might be unconstirutio'n-

"People always have the option 
of voting absentee and don't have

continued from page 8 
Back in glorious, colorful nighttime at the 

Park stage, J waited nervously in a sea of eager 
fans while the evenings last three perfor-
mances stood impossibly before us . The 
Walkmen came onstage dressed like the col-
lege professors of indie rock: all collared 
shirts, nary blue sweaters, slacks and blazers. 
Vocalist Walter Martin, who's blonde boyish-
ness can't but recall Coldplay's Chris Martin 
(and whose band sounds rather like the 
Coldplay of indie rock), ran frantically around 
the stage as the music cued him to; when it 
stopped he did too, a wayward little boy 
frozen by his mother's stem call, I was sur-

dents or momentary deparrures, but rather 
an exciting new color on their musical 
palette. Still, Brock's absurd shouting 
seemed punk-club fresh, even if his florid 
figure gave unmistakable hints of his 
band's newfound success. 

Modest Mouse's tormented set had to end, 
but what happened after made us wish that 
the concert did, too. Brock and his band 
quickly left the stage after their one-hour set, 
providing - we thought - a good reason for 
the awkward departure. "We need to get off 
the stage so you can see Lou Reed!" he shout-
ed. We were all terribly excited - until Reed 
acrually started playing. After a barely-recog-

prised as hell to hear the 
opening chords of "The 
Rat" - the Walkmen's 
stunning single - come 
through the PA after only 
one other song. Matt 
Barrick:" furious drumming 
propelled the crowd to its 
most frantic state so far, 
helped by guitarist Paul 
Maroon's incredible strum-
ming, while Martin's neck 
muscles bulged visibly, his 
voice striving for unattain-
able heights as it tried to 
match the fury of his band. 
He couldn't make it in the 
end - and without his sec-
ond guitar, the Wallanen's 
academic composure and 
East Coast class couldn't 
rouse the crowd ttl the 
transcendental heights so 
eagerly hoped for and 
seemingly so at hand on 
the group's recording, 

The rest of thei r set 
failed to match even a 
fraction of the excite-

nizable, Nico-Iess 
"All Tomorrow's 
Parties," Reed 
plunged into a set of 
his own idiotic, 
Dylan-esque ram-
blings. He'd stop his 
band to mumble a 
few random words 
into the lnicro-
phone, give the 
audience a weath-
ered, mystical look, 
then rurn around 
"nd give a signal for 
the din to continue. 
ATP promotions 
promised a set heavy 
with Velvet-
Underground 'tunes, 
but Reed didn't 
deliver. He waded 
through a murky, 
boring version of 
"Jesus," and at the 
end of a IO-minote 
noisefest started 
chanting "White 

ment of "The Rat," but it didn't matter, 
because Modest Mouse was on next . I 
could hear murmurs all through the crowd 
_ "] hope they play 'Cadillacs'"; U] can't 
believe we're going to see Modest Mouse" 
- and after a half-hour of technical diffi-
culties, vocalist Isaac Brock sauntered 
onstage to awkwardly announce the band's 
performance. 

"Don't you hate it when bands just 
stand on stage and talk?" he taunted. The 
audience laughed, but no one hated it. 
Brock's band jumped right into "Black 
Cadillacs" and the most anticipated hour 
of the festival had begun. The suddenly . 
huge crowd nodded, danced, pounded 
their heads and laughed in response to 
Brock's shenanigans and the band's messy 
post-rock - raunchy and di~tressed as 
newfound classics like "Bukowski" came 
across, no one seemed to care. With an 
army of instruments including a weird 
stand-up bass and banjo, Modest Mouse 
proved that the ventures into odd cowboy 
music that punctuated Good News For

trying to squeeze in some last few points with 
the youngsters, perhaps, But Reed's dead, his 
career and almost everything we liked about 
him when he fronted the VU gone; save for a 
few interesting interpretations of Edgar Allen 
Poe's "The Raven," Reed's performance 
notably lacked any great moments - a l:on-
siderable tragedy, considering that even the 
more disappointing of the younger bands 
managed to have a few. 

Newly crowned ' indie kings Modest 
Mouse may have played a rough set, but the 
night dearly belonged to them. At the c1i-
m:p: of climaxes - their 6nal number, the 
ubiquitous, triumphant single "Float On"-
the shared majesty of the evening was real-
ized. It was a sea of wayward youth mim-
micking the ramblings of their once blue-
collar, now rock-radio heroes; they were 
dressed in tattered, pricey clothes and drunk 
on 58 beers while the glitzy mess of Los 
Angeles revolved just over a small patch of 
shiny, black water, the gorgeous contradic-
tions of the night brought into electric blue 
and purple contrast for an audience that saw 
them, and didn't mind.

A Perfed Circle 
Emotive 

Record Label 

*** On the day when the Midwest - I mean, America - decided 
to .re-elect the village 
idiot, A Perfect Circle 
threw in their two cents 
with their third full-
length, Emotive, an assort-
ment of covers from 
Marvin Gaye to John 
Lennon. 

Maynard James 
Keenan 's enigmatically 
sweet voice graces a dozen 
songs that neatly address 
the themes of love, paci-
fism and the sad cynicism 
we might be headed 
toward. Unlike any typical 

cover album, Emotivt takes 
such classics as "What's 
Goin ' On" and "When the 
Levee Breaks" and trans-
forms them into modern 
e I ectronic/ al terna ti ve 
remixes that exhibit, for 
the most part, attractive 
alterations from the origi-
nals. Though I would be 
the first to attack anyone 
for trying to cover Gaye or 
Led Zeppelin, Keenan is 
one of the only vocalists 
out there who can do them 
justice by evoki ng their 
message through dreary 
rhythms that would have 
you charging the voting 
booths. 

However, the most 
notable challenge on the 
album fails . A Perfect 
Cricle tried to devise a ren-
dition of John Lennon 's 
idyllic anthem "Imagine," 
and though Keenan's 
melodies cry "respectful 
homage," the group nar-
rates the song with thun-
derous drumming that 
shakes away the gorgeous 
innocence of Lennon's 
classic.

Welcome to Haiti -

Koch 

** On his 1997 solo debut, former Fugee Wyclef Jean rapped, "The 
moral of the story: Don't 
blame no record compa-
nyl If your record ain't 
sellin', you lack creativi-
ty." Fast forward Sill years, 
and Wyclers records ain't 
sellin'. 

Hoping to regain some 
lost spice, Wyclef raps in 
English, Spanish, French 
and Creole on Welcome to 
Hlliti - Creolt 101, his 
Caribbean-infused new 
album. The set starts 

WEDNESDAY. NOVEMBER 10, 2004 

strong; the first single 
"President" makes inroads 
at recapturing the East 
Coast groove of Wyclef's 
earlier work, and the 
giddy "Bicentennial" 
proves that he does indeed 
have some Haitian left in 
his bones, 

But In the Disney-
esque "Party by the Sea," 
Wyclef dances dangerous-
ly close to Jimmy Buffet 
territory, and by the time 
we hear his rastafied "La 
Bamba," the queasy feel-
ing of sugar overload has 
set in. 

The remainder of the 
album sloshes between 
bouncy Caribbean dance, 
hip-hop and soft reggae; 
once all three are slapped 
together, the best ele-
ments of all the styles are 
lost in the mix, resulting 
in a sound wonhy of the 
fiesta mix on a Carnival 
cruIse. 

The moral, Wyclef?

pened to your creativity,

PorterS Pub gets poetic: Intimate ambience, 
laid-back style and poeby at -campus drinking hole 

Bimonthly readings at Poetry Slamm not just for bohemians 
IyJIAGU 

Contributing \WIer 

Granted, I'm not qualified to make such comparisons, but vis-iting a tanning salon seems a lot 
like reading poetry on stage. In one 
case, you are exposing your body to 
the glare of ultraviolet light. In the 
other, you are exposing your soul to 
the glare of coma-inducing stage 
lights. In both cases, shades are 
required attire. 

San Diegans are creepy fanatics 
of one, and seemingly indifferent to 
the other. It's no surprise that an 
event reserved for finger-snapping, 
joint-rolling, wine-guzzling 
bohemians drew a one-digit crowd 
at Porter's Pub on Nov. 3 - all but 
one of whom were female. 

Hosted by Associated Students, 
the Poetry Slamm drew an audience 
number unworthy of featured guest 
Brandon Cesmat, a Californian poet 
who can find genuine inspiration not 
only in beach strolling, but in the 
synergy between cultures, land and 
spirit. 

After earning his Master of Fine 
Arts from San Diego Sl:lte, Cesmat 
moved on to teaching positions at 
Cal State San Marcos, Palomar 
College and California Poets in the 
Schools (CPITS). His devotion to 
writing and teaching is reflected in 
his mastery of the letter. Hailed as a 
"man of ice who melts hearts with 
his words.» Ces~t's poems are 
shots of vivid imagery and sensuality, 
chased with rhythms paired to the 
groove of jazz music. In "How to 
Learn a Thing or Two," Cesmat 
mixes philosophy with a Betty 

Croclcer-recipe format, instructing , 
listeners to "Bake in sununer/ Chill 
in winter," to "Stir in no questions or 
take a step back, .. and to "Listen and 
enjoy whenever possib1e! But be 
prepared to add tears when your 
tears are due. " 

Cesmat's poems demonize his 
father's tumor, aggrandize the 
domestic routine and even frame 
politics in a "1984" allegory in 
"Tens Teacher": "Two plus two 
equals fourl But it would be kind of 
swell if it equaled five or more." 

Humor-traced lines paired 
with a beer from the Pub are well 
worth a break from the tann;ng 
salon. If you go through true with-
drawal. rest assured the studio 
lights - misdirected at audience 
members - will provide an expe-
rience similar to basking in the 
sun. The next Poetry Slamm is on 
Nov. 17, featuring guest poet 
Bradley Steffens. Aspiring poets 
can sign up to read at 6:30 p.m.; 
readings begin at 7 p.m. Don't for-
get to bring sunglasses. 

Mulloy MonrM/ Cootdion 
Poetic inspfttion: Brandon Cesmat is one of the featured poets at the bimonthly 
PoetIy S1amm readings at Porter's Pub.

Retort: Hatred of Bonds reflects bitterness 

• I I r 

continued from pa,e ,6 
players to play for the love of the 
game, Reilly will take time out of 
his busy schedule to sling mud at 
Bonds. Less than two months ago, 
Reilly took a break from his nor-
mally cornball tearjerkers and 
'!fOle a sarcastically clever piece on 
Bonds filled with low blows about 
steroids usage, his defensive play 
and his arrogance. 

I have a friend here at UCSD 
who is a very misinformed man. 
He has no reason to dislike Bonds; 
he has never met him and never 
will. However, he reads Spons 
Illustrated and he listens to 
rumors about steroids and juiced 
balls and is under the impression 
that Barry Bonds is the worst 
thing to happen to baseball since 
Darryl Strawberry did his first 
white line. This type of naivete is 
rampant all over the world and 
especially here at UCSD, where 
students hate Barry worse than 
they hate parrying. 

about him and this is why 
reporters hate him. They are used 
to being sucked up to because of 
the consequences that someone 
faces for not submitting to the 
media circuis. Many players will 
go out of their way to be nice to 
reporters 50 that in return. writers 
will make them sound intelligent. 
seem funny and appear to be per-
fect role models for the children. 

! 
'\ 
\ 
, / IilMTHE . f Bonds is despised by many 

sportswriters in the United States 
because he often turns down inter-
views without common politeness or 
answers questions with a growl. The 
worst part of this whole conspiracy 
against Bonds is that writers dis-
pense their opinions to readers who 
believe what they are told because 
they have no other means of infor-
mation. This, ladies and gentlemen, 
is the power of press at work. 

Despite his less-than-bubbly 
personality, there is no denying 
that Bonds is showing the greatest 
offensive prowess of our generation 
and possibly any generation . Bonds 
is dominating the baseball world 
and breaking records as he breaks 
the bank. He's no Ty Cobb. Mike 
Tyson or Rocker, so let 's just let 
him stay quiet and respect him for 
what he has done over his incredi-
ble 19-year career. 

, - SEcote COMING. I ' 
/ . 

Columnists like Reilly dislike 
Bonds because he doesn't jump 
through hoops for reporters so he 
can have good pllblic relations to 
garner more endorsements form 
Nike or Tinactin. He simply 
doesn't care what people think

her career. 
"This year, she'd become just 

as strong as last year," McManus 
said. "Especially coming off her 
third ACL injury, I didn't think 
she'd be starting till later in the 
season. But she worked like heck 
in the summer, and she's been 
phenomenal. " 

As a midfielder, she has the 
ability to read plays well and has a 
keen sense of her teammates' 
position on the field. Dickey can 
either take the ball to the net her-
self or feed a pass to set up scoring 
chances. She was second on the 
team in scoring, with 19 points, 
and tied Cochran for most goals, 
with eight, including three game-
winning goals. Although she's 
only a sophomore, Dickey has 
stepped up and taken an active 
role as the leader, serving as co-

captain with Szafraniec. 
Cochran was last year's CCAA 

Freshman of the Year and All-CCAA 
First Team selection. She is one of 
the most feared snipers in the league 
because her speed and ability to rum 
on a dime make it difficult to knock 
her off the ball. Cochran is effective 
at taking tough shots and making 
passes in the box despite being dou-
ble- or triple-teamed. 

"She's been hampered a bit with 
injuries this season, but she's played 
well and been a leader," McManus 
said. 

Despite playing with some 
injuries, Cochran is a player that 
McManus has been able to rely on, 
especially at clutch times. Her 23 
points this season led UCSD in 
scoring, with eight goals, seven 
assists and four game-winning 
goals. Cochran has also come 
through for UCSD in penalty kick 

Rugby: Preseason success 
bodes well for novice team 

continl4td from page ,6 
football is so popular, it is diffi-
cult for rugby to expand. 

A sport that began at a small, 
private boys school in Britain, 
rugby is now one of the most 
watched and played sport in 
most of Europe. The game start-
ed out as a sport for the upper 
class in Britain in the 1700s and 
is now played by people all over 
the world. The rules and style of 
play have not changed much 
since the game was invented. In 
contrast, football has recently 
added instant replay, and new 
equipment is always being devel-
oped to shield players from con-
tact. 

Many people consider rugby 
not just a sport, but a religion. 
They find it fascinating that a 
player will absorb a tackle from 
all 15 opposing players. A high-
light reel in football usually con-
sists of just two tacklers on a 
player who is protected by layers 
of padding. Basic shorts and a 
jersey seem sufficient for rugby 
players to survive their "rebel 
sport." 

The spread of rugby'S popu-
larity is already hitting UCSD. 
The team has 30 new players on 
its 46-man roster. 

"Most of them have never 
even seen a rugby ball," 
Sanderson said. 

A third of the starting 15 in a 
victory over USC on Oct. 31 

were rookies. Although the 
rookies are succeeding on the 
field, they are still working with 
raw talent and learning the 
game. 

The new players will have 
. plenty of time to develop their 

skills when the team scrimmages 
Loyola Marymount at home on 
Nov. 20 and visits Claremont on 
Dec. 4 . The seasoh will begin in 
mid-January when the Tritons 
will take on UC Santa Barbara at 
home. 

"It is a long season, and I am 
sure everything will come 
together as long as we continue 
to work hard," Sanderson said. 

Men's rugby has continued to 
grow since its establishment at 
UCSD. The team is working on 
building an alumni base for sup-
port and played an alumni game 
on Nov. 6. 

"So many great athletes come 
to UCSD because they choose 
academics over sports," 
Sanderson said. "The team gives 
them a chance to get back into 
athletics, and they just get com-
pletely hooked." 

As football continues to 
change its rules, the only change 
in rugby's future appears to be its 
impact on the United SUtes and 
colleges like UCSD. Students 
are invited to watch or partici-
pate during practices on Monday 
nights at Muir Field from 5 :30 to 
8 p.m. 

situations, converting on all her 
attempts. 

Lautenschleger patiently waited 
for her opportunity to attain the 
starting goalie posi tion, and she 
rurned it into a remarkable season. 
Her quickness and athleticism 
made it tricky for opposing players 
to get the ball past her. 
Lautenschleger plays much bigger 
than her 5'6" frame would suggest 
and is not afraid to step out and 
challenge oncoming attackers. She 
led all CCM goalies with nine 
shutouts and a 0.66 goals-against 
average. The low goals-against 
average consistently ranked her in 
the top 10 among all NCAA 
Division II goalies throughout the 
2004 season. 

"She's been very patient," 
McManus said. "She came in with a 
young team and gave the team 
great confidence from the back. "

The UCSD women's soccer 
team was clearly the team to beat 
in the 2004 season, with several 

. strong offensive players and a 
seemingly impenetrable defense. 
As a result of the team's remark-
able all-around play, the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association awarded four Tritons 
First Team A11-CCAA honors. 
Senior goalie Jamie 
Lautenschleger, junior defender 
Heather Szafraniec, sophomore

Men's season ends as Triton 
women advance to Nationals 

By NATALIE JORION 
Contributing Writer 

The Triton women's cross 
country team showed what it was 
made of at the NCAA Division II 
West Regional Meet on Nov. 6 at 
Western Washington University 
in Bellingham, Wash . UCSD 
placed an impressive second out 
of 19 teams, qualifying the team 
for the NCAA Division II 
National Cross Country 
Championships, on Nov. 20 in 
Evansville, Ind. 

Junior Michelle DiMeo and 
senior Lindsay Stalker both ran 
outstanding races on the 6,000-
meter course, crossing the finish 
line at 23 minutes, 4] seconds and 
23 :43, respectively. With their 

11 th- and 12 th-place finishes, 
they earned the UCSD team A1l-
West Region honors. Close 
behind the duo was senior Mimi 
Hodgins, who crossed the line in 
21st-place with a time of 24:09. 

Chico State, placing first over-
all, ha.d four runners in the top 10, 
with a total score of 49 points. 
UCSD was not too far behind 
with 96 total points. Alaska 
Anchorage and Seattle Pacific, the 
third and fourth place teams, 
respectively, had 168 and 172 
points, respectively. 

As a result of their excellent 
performances, the women's team 
will go to Nationals at Southern 
Indiana University on Nov. 20 for

ers helped UCSD finish atop the 
conference with a 14-3-1 record, 
and register its fifth-straight 
South Division title and fifth-
consecutive appearance in the 
CCAA Championships, under 
head coach Brian McManus. 

Team co-captain Szafraniec is 
the anchor of the Tritons' 
defense, which was ranked among 
the top in goals allowed. She is a 
local product of Scripps Ranch 
High School, and her defensive 
skills earned her CCAA 
Freshman of the Year honors in 
2002. A stay-at-home defender, 
she is rarely out of position and 
can quickly cut off an oncoming 
attacker's shot angle. Her defen-
sive prowess in the backfield 
allows her fellow defenders to 

push up and join the offensive 
attack. Although she injured her 
ankle during the season, she 
remained the defensive stalwart 
for UCSD, refusing to let the 
injury deter her . 

"She came in and [has] been a 
starter since high school," 
McManus said. "She's the team 
captain and team leader. She's done 
a tremendous job and put the pro-
gram first. She's played in games 
that no other [injured] player 
would have." 

Another local on the Tritons' 
roster is Torrey Pines High School 
graduate Dickey, whose consistent 
playmaking and scoring skills gave 
her the first conference honor of

San Francisco Giants outfield-er Barry Bonds has won Major League Baseball's 
Most Valuable Player six times, 
more than anyone in the history of 
baseball. He also WOrl the MVP 
award three years in a row while no 
other player had even won it more 
than three times, period. According 
to Jim Molony, a writer for 
MLB.com, "Bonds looks like the 
clear choice for the honor this 
year," which would make it an 
unprecedented fourth in a row. 
This man holds the single-season 
home run record and is on pace to 
break the career home run record 
currently held by Hank Aaron. 
There is no question that Barry 
Bonds is one of the best offensive 
players of all time, if not the best, 
yet he is one of the most hated men 
in sports since John Rocker. 

Unlike Rocker, Bonds is not 
racist, sexist or a chauvinistic pig; he 
simply does not like to be a role 
model or pretend to be someone he 
is not. Bonds is not Donovan 
McNabb or DerekJeter; he does not 
do cheesy Campbell's commercials 
or public relations moves to get on 
People's "50 Most Beautiful People 
List." Bonds simply hits balls into 
orbit and then drives home to stay 
out of the spotlight. This is not a 
crime or a weakness; it is only a part 
of the complex character that is 
Barry Bonds. Yet fans, reporters and 
baseball players alike constantly 
attack him as a disgrace to the game. 

Every year, it seems Spons 
Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly 
writes a column bashing Bonds. ]n

Men's rugby anticipates strong year 
Recruitment targets footb~ players at UCSD 

By MICHAEL NEUmDTER 
Contributing Writer 

For some, it is hard to turn in 
the football equipment after that 
final high school game, and since 
there is no football team at 
UCSD, there is only one solu-
tion: Ditch the protective gear 
and play rugby. 

The UCSD men's rugby 
team has been converting foot~ 
ball players to rugby since the 
team was founded in 1966. 

"The sport is just about to 
break through. I never even 
watch football anymore because 
it is all about rugby," junior team 
captain Chris Sanderson said. 

Sanderson was recruited out 
of high school to play collegiate 
football as a cornerback, but 
chose to attend UCSD instead 
for academic reasons. 

Rugby is not much different 
than football, except for the fact

from players do not wear protec-
tive pads. 

"I played football all through 
high school, but when I went to 
a rugby practice, some guy told 
me he lost a piece of his ear 
while playing Stanford last year," 

freshman Mark Dimapawi said, 
before deciding not to play. 
"That is when I decided I would 
draw the line at football."
