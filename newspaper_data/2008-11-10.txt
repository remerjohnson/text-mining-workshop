Grad Students Outraged Over New Housing Policy
By Joyce Yeh
Staff Writer

Over 600 graduate stu-dents may be evicted from university-owned 
residences by December under a 
policy approved by UC Affiliated 
Housing late last month.

The new contract — which 
affects  about a fourth of the 2,178 
graduate students housed in all 
four of the university’s graduate 
and professional communities — 
will limit guaranteed housing for 
incoming graduate students to one 
year in lieu of the previous housing 
policy, which guaranteed students 
a place to live for the entire dura-
tion of their graduate studies, pro-
viding that academic qualification 
was maintained.  

Those students who will have 
resided in university housing for 

over a year come December now 
face having their stay cut short by 
the new policy. 

According to Dean of Graduate 
Studies Kim Barrett, the purpose 
of the contractual reform is to 
foster graduate unity and assist 
new students, especially those 
from outside the San Diego area, 
in finding housing in the private 
sector.

“The ultimate goal, which is 
consistent with the [Graduate 
Student Association] survey, is 
to offer and guarantee two-year 
housing, build community among 
incoming students and allow inter-
action between students of differ-
ent areas of study,” she said.

Although the eventual goal is a 
two-year contract, only a one-year 
contract will be available during 
the transitional stage to accommo-
date all students currently waitlist-

ed for housing. With new graduate 
housing complexes nearly com-
plete, 400 new beds are expected to 
be available by March 2009.

Barrett added that these policy 
changes will not affect graduate 
students living in family housing 
or students who were guaranteed 
housing or waitlisted before Sept. 
30.

“[The plan] would help recruit 
graduate students if all of them 
got housing and got to keep it, but 
when they realize they’re going 
to be kicked out at the end of 
the year, it’s not very meaning-
ful,” literature graduate student 
Benjamin Balthaser said. “I think 
this is incredibly ill-advised. It 
does a great deal of harm to cur-
rent graduate students.”

Grove Reports Profit; Council to Assess Cafe’s Future

By Omair Qazi
Staff Writer

The Grove Caffe is projected to 
make an $11,000 profit for the month 
of October, following significant chang-
es to the student-run business’ internal 
operations enacted in response to the 
eatery’s massive debt.

Chelsea Maxwell, associate vice 
president of A.S. Enterprise Operations, 
said she expects the Grove to continue 
earning a profit in coming months 
as returning customers and increased 

catering services bolster the cafe’s finan-
cial margins.

“I think that as time goes on we will 
gain a strong base of customers loyal to 
the Grove, and that as we expand our 
catering services we will be reaching 
out to more of the UCSD community,” 
she said. 

Maxwell serves on the Grove 
Advisory Committee, a nonvoting body 
responsible for facilitating communica-
tion between Grove management and 
the A.S. Council. The committee plans 
to meet at least three times before the 
end of the quarter to discuss pertinent 
financial issues before establishing a 
formal meeting schedule for Winter 
Quarter. While no benchmarks or 
timetables have been set, Maxwell said 
councilmembers are closely observing

With an $11.2 billion budget short-
fall looming over California’s economy, 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger convened 
an emergency legislative meeting Nov. 
9 to propose a series of midyear bud-
get cuts, including an additional $65.5 
million reduction to state funding for 
the University of California. 

Calling for a total $132 million 
decrease in funding for the UC and 
California State University systems in 
addition to a $2.3 billion reduction to 
K-12 funding, Schwarzenegger’s plan 
was developed to address the state’s 
ongoing economic difficulties. 

A shortfall projected at $14.5 bil-
lion earlier this year prompted drastic 
budget cuts to nearly all state-funded 
enterprises and operations included in 
the 2008-09 state budget. The contin-
ued severity of the economic downturn 
led Schwarzenegger to seek additional 
budget reductions in an effort to revive 
California’s ailing economy. 

University officials contend that the 
suggested midyear cuts would place 
an untold financial strain on the uni-
versity, which has already been forced 
to endure the effects of a budget that 
fell $100 million short of the amount 
deemed necessary by the Board of 
Regents last year to support continued 
enrollment growth. 

UC Office of the President spokes-
man Ricardo Vazquez said the addi-
tional cuts would likely require cam-
puses to search for savings in areas that 
would otherwise be considered safe 
from the impacts of financial reduc-
tions.

“If these cuts are approved there 
would definitely be deeper budget cuts 
and it would force campuses to turn 
to other reductions that would poten-
tially have an impact on the quality 
of the educational experience at the 
UC,” Vazquez said. “It would force the 
campuses to turn to options like hiring 
more lecturers, having fewer ladder-
rank faculty, reducing class offerings 
and increasing class sizes. It would 
definitely have a more harsh impact.”

UC President Mark G. Yudof called 
for legislators to consider the impor-
tance of higher education before final-
izing any decisions regarding funding 
for California’s public universities.

“We are of course disappointed to 
be facing another potential budget cut 
on top of the reductions we are already 
making this year,” Yudof said. “We 
believe higher education is crucial to 
California’s ability to grow its way out 
of this economic downturn, and we 
ultimately need to be talking about 
ways to improve investment in our 
state’s human capital.”

GOV. PROPOSES 
MIDYEAR CUTS 
TO UNIVERSITY 

FUNDING
By Henry Becker
Staff Writer

Although President-elect Barack 
Obama unveiled a plan to reform 
higher education early in his cam-
paign, declaring a goal to make 
college affordable and available to 
middle-class families, recent public 
statements have led experts to doubt 
whether his presidency will reflect 
those promises. 

For college students seek-
ing ways to cover growing tuition 
costs, Obama has proposed a $4,000 
refundable tax credit, nearly four 
times the current Hope Credit 
offered by the IRS, in return for 
100 hours of community service. 
Obama also discussed streamlin-
ing the financial-aid process while 
increasing the availability of work-
study programs during talks with 
the National Education Assessment 
Program last spring. 

Obama declared his intention to 
increase Pell Grants for low-income 
students to attend college by $1.5 
billion. Currently the program has a 
$16 billion annual budget. 

However, professor of political 
science Sandy Lakoff said that while 
Obama made education a recurring 
theme throughout the primary elec-
tion, he played the issue down dur-
ing the general election. 

“Obama’s elaborate proposals for 
student aid were made in 2007, at a 
time when he was relying heavily on 
support from younger voters, espe-
cially those on college campuses 
who were vital primary voters and 
caucusgoers,” Lakoff said. “Since he

won the nomination and has had 
to court a broader segment of the 
electorate, he has alluded to these 
proposals only vaguely.”

During the primaries, Obama 
made promises to increase teach-
ers’ pay based on individual perfor-
mance and promoted a “zero to five” 
program, which places an empha-
sis on early care and education for 
infants and encourages states to 
move toward voluntary universal 
preschool, but Lakoff said that with-
in subsequent speeches and during 
his debates with Republican nomi-
nee Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) he 
toned down his rhetoric. In a Sept. 9 
address on the topic of education in 
Dayton, Ohio, Obama avoided spe-
cific policy goals regarding funding 
and restructuring, focusing instead 
on the general importance of educa-
tion and reform.

“This [trend] may indicate that 
his commitment to [funding and 
restructuring] is more that of an 
office-seeking politician than a 
champion and is therefore subject 
to the vagaries of campaigning and 
governing,” Lakoff said. “In any 

case, they are probably not going to 
get higher priority.”

However, Obama’s focus on 
reforming the Bush administration’s 
No Child Left Behind Act since 
2002 is promising, UCSD professor 
and Director of Education Studies 
Amanda Datnow said.

“Obama has promised to 
improve the assessments that are 
used to track student progress and 
to provide support to rather than 
punish low-performing schools,” 
Datnow said. “He has also suggested 
important changes with respect to 
recruiting and retaining high-qual-
ity teachers, educating English lan-
guage learners and improving after-
school programs.”

Additionally, Obama has talk-
ed about enlarging Head Start, an 
early childhood education program, 
and making it more affordable for 
low-income families, according to 
Lakoff. Both Datnow and Lakoff 
consider Obama’s proposals, as they 
stand, to be solid.

“His proposals are indeed a step 
in the right direction, both in K-12 
and higher education,” Datnow said. 
“His education advisor through the 

campaign was Stanford professor 
Linda Darling-Hammond, who is a 
strong, well-respected voice regard-
ing educational reform in the teach-
ing profession and in creating more 
equity and access.” 

The issue of education has been 
frequently overshadowed by the 
current economic crisis. Datnow 
said she considers Obama’s propos-
als in higher education as a way to 
slow the damage currently sustained 
from massive budget cuts. 

“With respect to the UC sys-
tem, Obama’s proposals will hope-
fully assist us in achieving goals 
of improving access and funding 
for higher education at the student 
level,” Datnow said. “However, in 
California, we will still be grappling 
with a severe budget shortfall at the 
institutional level.”

Chair of the department of eco-
nomics Julian Betts agreed that the 
economy is deeply linked to the 
state of education in California.

“Both K-12 and postsecondary 
education in California are entirely 
held hostage by the budget crisis in 
Sacramento, which in turn is a func-
tion of the global financial crisis,” 

Betts said. “We all are going to have 
to hold our breath and wait for the 
economy to mend itself.”

However, Lakoff said that because 
both Obama and his wife Michelle 
were students who depended on 
loans to pay for college, he remains 
hopeful for the president-elect’s 
committment to higher education. 
In January 2004, Obama and his 
wife paid the last of over $42,000 in 
student debts for both undergradu-
ate studies and law school.

“Enabling young people to pur-
sue higher education is a cause in 
which Obama obviously has a keen 
interest, especially since he and his 
wife were beneficiaries of aid pro-
grams,” Lakoff said.

Lakoff also noted that the 
Democratic president-elect is much 
more likely to find cooperation in 
the UC system.

“University faculties are over-
whelmingly in favor of the 
Democrats and would rather deal 
with an Obama administration,” 
Lakoff said.

who are not listed as the primary 
contact on the lease — will face 
eviction upon the primary tenant’s 
departure. Currently, the housing 
contract gives secondary tenants a 
“permanent resident” status after a 
12-month stay in Affiliated Housing. 
Because the new policy is retroactive, 
though, residents who have already 
fulfilled their year requirement still 
face potential eviction.    

“They want 
to vacate hun-
dreds of second-
aries when their 
primaries move 
out,” Affiliated 
Housing Advisory 
Committee rep-
resentative Reece 
Peck said. “I find 
that very troubling, 
considering that 
the secondaries 
made their deci-
sion to live in on-
campus housing in 
terms of housing 
stability. I see that 
as extremely unfair to retroactively 
make them move out.”  

GSA unanimously passed a resolu-
tion on Nov. 4 against the new housing 
policy, calling for the immediate sus-
pension of the plan, which the group 
labels “excessively restrictive and 
unfair to the transitional cohort.” 

The resolution condemns the plan 
on the grounds that students signed 
the current contract without knowl-
edge of the proposed changes, forcing 
them to give up other housing options 
that may no longer be available. 

“What’s troubling to me in debat-
ing this new policy with the admin-
istration is how consistently the 
debate is framed solely in terms of 
availability rather than in terms of 

affordability,” Peck said. “What this 
new one-year residence limit does is 
drastically reduce graduate students’ 
access to and occupancy in the only 
housing options that are semiafford-
able.”

According to the resolution, the 
change is a violation of the UCSD 
Principles of Community and goes 
“against the best interests of gradu-
ates and students.” The GSA contends 
that the policy was passed without 

“significant gradu-
ate student or fac-
ulty input or over-
sight,” preventing 
a proper commit-
tee review process 
and the support of 
either the Affiliate 
Housing Advisory 
Committee or the 
Grad Life Steering 
Committee.

“The university 
is violating its own 
contract,” Balthaser 
said. “This policy 
was enacted behind 
closed doors with 

no consultation with the gradu-
ate student body. If [the plan] is 
so beneficial, why didn’t [Barrett] 
consult with the Graduate Student 
Association?” 

In response to the new policy, 
graduate students have circulated a 
petition opposing the change, gath-
ering over 1,000 signatures so far.  

A meeting to discuss the policy 
changes — which will be attended by 
GSA President Nick Saenz, Barrett 
and Director of Housing and Dining 
Mark Cunningham — is scheduled 
for Nov. 10 at 5:30 p.m. in the Price 
Center Forum.

the Grove’s performance to see if the 
A.S. enterprise is providing a service 
that interests students. 

“As long as the Grove is producing 
[a] profit, we see no reason to shut 
it down,” Maxwell said. “However, if 
October proves to be an anomaly, and 
we do not see profits in the months to 
come, we will then have to make deci-
sions on what to do next.”

Eleanor Roosevelt College Senator 
Chris McCoy has called for greater 
accountability with the council’s over-
sight of failing student enterprises.  As 
part of his senator project, McCoy is 
attempting to gain access to the budgets 
of various A.S. enterprises.

“Right now [A.S. enterprises] seem 
to be losing money for us,” McCoy said. 
“I’m trying to work on how we can 
reverse that, so we don’t have to resort 
to raising student fees.”

McCoy has called for the council to 
hold a discussion on the Grove, some-
thing he said has not occurred because 
the upcoming A.S. student fee referen-
dum has been occupying the council’s 
agenda. McCoy plans to speak with 
Grove management and examine the 
financial health of the enterprise.

“What I really think is necessary is 
just common business sense,” McCoy 
said. “We have to see if the operation is 
a good one. Is it necessary?”

McCoy is reluctant to call for the 
Grove to be closed, stating that every 
student enterprise contributes to a more 
self-sustaining student community. 

“We need to have more of an entre-
preneurial spirit and fill in the gaps 
[with respect] to what students are and 
are not offered,” he said.

Last week we came together like never before, overwhelmingly casting our votes for President-
elect Barack Obama and giving a 
great big middle finger to everyone 
who ever underestimated the power 
of motivated young voters. And I’m 
fucking excited to see that most peo-
ple as frustrated as I am with the last 
eight years of corruption, hypocrisy 
and downright stupidity we’ve seen 
from Republicans, led by the Bush 
administration. But it was also pretty 
exciting to see UCSD students rally 
together over something other than 
the Sun God Festival. 

Yup, cat’s out of the bag Tritons. 
You aren’t soulless zombies, magi-
cally unleashed only once a year, 
you’re humans — now it’s time to 
start acting like it the other 364. 

Don’t play dumb; don’t look up 
from your paper, glancing around 
like you’re so innocent. I’m talking 
to you! 

You, who ventures into UCSD’s 
sprawling landscape only to attend 
your classes and sometimes not 
even then. You, who walks brisk-
ly from one lecture to another, 
plugged immediately into your iPod 
or Bluetooth, making zero effort 
to communicate with your class-
mates. You, who arrives in class 
early, sitting along the aisle so as to 
force latecomers to scramble awk-
wardly over your unforgiving knees. 
You, who visits campus eateries and 
shops with your eyes locked tightly 
on the ground, cutting human inter-
action to its absolute minimum and 
ruthlessly rejecting friendly small 
talk from well-meaning cashiers. 
You, who when boarding a campus 
shuttle plants yourself prematurely 
forward in the middle aisle, forcing 
other riders to cluster unreason-
ably at the front of the vehicle and 
denying other students entry alto-
gether. You, who denounces campus 
activities as stupid, poisoning these 
potentially awesome events in favor 
of another Halo marathon. This 
needs to stop!

We found the magic fix-it elixir, 
it was right in front of us all along. 
Now rather than complain about 
how lame UCSD is, we can actu-
ally do something to change that. 
Come on guys, seriously. Electing a 
president that we wanted turned out 
to be simple, all it took was for each 
of us to show up on Nov. 4 and cast 
our vote. Fixing UCSD’s chronic 
anti-socialness is just as simple, but 
like electing a president, we all have 
to commit to the change for it to 
work. But there’s nothing like an 
epic victory to get you feeling a 
little friendlier, anyway. So smile at 
a passing Triton, introduce your-
self to a classmate, do your home-
work outside for a change, put on 
some blue and gold and check out 
a home game, if you live on campus 
attend a dorm-sponsored event and 
if you’re an upperclassman attend a 
Bear Garden. 

Let’s ride this wave as far as it 
will take us.

Stealing

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA — In 
an effort to address the $11.2 bil-
lion funding shortfall, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger has proposed addi-
tional midyear $65.5 million budget 
cuts to the University of California 
— already struggling to support surg-
ing enrollment while maintaining 
educational standards with stripped-
bare financial resources. The cuts 
arrive during an already dire bud-
get crisis affecting California’s entire 
public-education system, including 
— in addition to the University of 
California — K-12 schools, commu-
nity colleges and the California State 
University.

Higher education’s giant allot-

ment of funds, second in size only to 
those of K-12 education and health 
and human services (both currently 
under similar funding fire) on the 
state budget, seems the most logical 
place from which to cut. Though 
we’ve slowly but surely been pulling 
ourselves from the hole, California 
is still in devastating debt — and, 
compared to more concrete areas of 
spending, the UC system budget is 
largely flexible in that there’s hun-
dreds of theoretically downsizeable 
items to undermine. But in the long 
run, sanding down our highest-
minded promise for self-betterment 
is dangerously detrimental to the 
eventual recuperation of the state’s 
economy and budget deficit.

California’s nationally lauded 
higher-education system is an indi-

rect contributor to the state’s future 
growth and prosperity — addition-
ally working to shrink the social-class 
gap by providing thousands of low-
income individuals with opportunities 
for social mobility, career advance-
ment and the chance to compete for 
a six-figure jobs in more profitable 
sectors of the state’s economy. But the 
UC system also steps up as a highly 
visible and valuable player in the 
current California economy, hosting 
more than 370,000 jobs for residents 
and their families while producing 
approximately $16.65 billion of the 
state’s gross domestic product, one of 
the largest outputs by any given entity 
within our economic system.

In essence, this shortsightedness 
could trap us in a permanent state of 
merely trying to keep our heads above 

water, instead of taking budget blows 
now in other areas and investing in 
our most concentrated cluster of tal-
ent to, potentially, overcome and pre-
vent the recurrence of this drought in 
the future. More immediately, further 
budget cuts to the university will not 
only stifle the state’s economic prog-
ress by lowering both the quantity 
and quality of human capital, but cost 
thousands of individual families their 
source of income, especially within 
the middle and working class — the 
very demographic that has already 
bore so much of the brunt of the cur-
rent financial crisis. 

The almost impossibly con-
strained budget could deal fateful 
blows to our reputation — and for

ON CAMPUS — That midmorn-
ing stroll down Library Walk may 
begin innocuously enough — all you 
want, really, is to make it to Center 
Hall without being victimized by a 
careless, civilian-trampling bicyclist 
as you glance down at your iPod 
— but then, in that fleeting moment 
between tracks, you’re ambushed by 
a perfectly sweet-looking girl who 
has already extended a flyer your way 
without the slightest air of agenda, 
though it’s quickly established that 
there’s a free party on Saturday night 
and she wants YOU to be there!

If you’re in a charitable mood 
(let’s face it, you didn’t have plans 
that night anyway), you decide not 
only to acknowledge the girl’s pres-
ence with eye contact, but to accept 
the little scrap of paper — hell, 
you even hold on to it for a couple 
hours. 

It’s not until later, as you actu-
ally read over the flyer, that your 
interest is piqued. Free pizza is a 
strong enough selling point in itself, 
but upon realizing that there will 
also be a dance party, you know 
you’re in. It’s not entirely clear what 
type of organization this UCSD 
InterVarsity is, as the flyer offers no 
hints of explanation — we’re merely 
promised a Saturday night worth 
remembering. To satiate curiosity 
you log on to the Web site, only to 

learn that the so-called IV (because 
the young and the hip always favor 
acronyms) is … the InterVarsity 
Christian Fellowship?

The Christian Fellowship is only 
one of several campus organizations 
that aim to increase membership 
through less-than-upfront means. 
Nowhere is it mentioned, except 
perhaps in the most illegible of fine 
print, that we’re being recruited by 
a religious organization. Not even 
the most perceptive of lit/writing 
majors could possibly infer — from 
the glossy, carefree flyer — that the 
group of students, according to its 
Web site, is devoted solely to “devel-
oping ‘inductive’ ways of studying 
the Bible, making small-group Bible 
studies mainstream structures in 
churches, [and] training in relational 
approaches to evangelism.”

Granted, the recruiters take a 
pretty pragmatic approach; they 
must recognize that revealing even 
so much as their full name on a 
flyer would turn off almost every 
unsuspecting student on his way to 
Center Hall, so instead they rebrand 
themselves as the catchy, elusive 
UCSD IV. They know that to most 
students, a “student Christian move-
ment started by students in England 
in the late 19th century” holds about 
as much appeal as a post-writeup 
disciplinary meeting with the col-
lege dean. So instead (promotional 
materials don’t lie, exactly — after 
all, how un-Christian would that 

be?) the recruiters just withhold the 
truth a little bit. Bury the lead, if 
you will.

But there’s something to be said 
for seeking membership through 
more honest means. Can a non-
religious student who showed up 
merely on the promise of pizza and 
a little midterm-tension release be 
reasonably expected to stick around 
for Bible study, based on whatever 
short-winded keyword a recruiter 
could slip in from across the picnic 
table?

A little further down Library 
Walk, you may have also come 
across a table for the pre-election 
Yes on Proposition 8 campaign. 
Conversely, this membership drive 
— though defined as political rather 
than religious, as the church can-
not technically interfere with the 
state — openly flaunts its Christian 
agenda. Sure, they recycle all the 
same old standby secular arguments 
— “Think of the children!” — but 
they also use traditional religious 
appeal to their advantage, going so 
inappropriately far as to place Bibles 
on their table. The implication here, 
of course, is that if you’re still unde-
cided on how to vote on Prop 8, you 
need look no further. It’s spelled right 
out for you, the common folk, and it 
sure don’t come any more clear-cut 
than this! Forget the fact that, for 
our own protection, there exists an 
alleged constitutional barrier against 
the interests of the church affecting 

governmental policy — do you really 
want to go against the word of God?

But at least the on-campus sec-
tor of Yes on Proposition 8 is being 
upfront with itself and the com-
munity about its motivations. On a 
national level, the campaign was no 
more honest with its agenda than an 
InterVarsity pizza party: The initia-
tive to define marriage as between 
a man and a woman was falsely 
portrayed as a protective measure 
against the teaching of gay mar-
riage in schools and other unrelated 
consequences, when in reality the 
proposition was only in the interest 
of the church, in an effort to violate 
others’ rights so it could maintain an 
aged and prejudiced tradition.

What’s most disheartening about 
the existence of such subversive 
movements — both concealing their 
true nature, and with one going so 
far as to impose religion onto a 
political arena — is their success. 
InterVarsity claims to be the larg-
est student organization at UCSD, 
and Proposition 8 succeeded in its 
mission to amend the California 
Constitution to ban gay marriage. If 
there’s one thing that is indeed clear, 
it’s that we the students must ques-
tion what these groups are beneath 
the surface — and, in doing so, must 
ask what exactly they’re trying to 
hide.

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

Dear Editor,
It has severely dented my faith in 

humanity that in the 21st century, 
California, a state which I would con-
sider representative of one of the 
most progressive, educated and lib-
eral populations in the United States, 
attained a majority in favor of legisla-
tion based on discrimination. 

What I have observed is people 
congratulating each other and saying 
they have done a great service for the 
children of America.

Sometimes the best way to win an 
argument is to make a perfectly valid 
argument about an irrelevant point, 
particularly one involving children or 
puppies — basically anything cute. 

People become irrational when 
you put a child in front of them. As 
a scientist I understand; it’s animal 
instinct, there’s 400 million years of 
evolution behind a drive to protect 
our offspring at all costs. Put the 
welfare of a child, particularly a girl 
— given a natural male tendency 
to protect the female sex — into 
an argument and you can illicit 
an irrational response. Then you 
can attack the moral conscience of 
anyone who opposes your position 
regardless of the debate, and it’s no 
longer a debate about equality, it’s 
“Do you hate children or don’t you?” 
I don’t know about you, but I don’t 
hate children. Hating children is just 
immoral.

Picture the scene. You’re on the 
7 a.m. flight, you dealt with traffic, 
having your personal space violated 
by security and have the misfortune 
of being seated next to a screaming, 
banging, spitting little creature. The 
rational part of your brain says this 
is a six-hour flight and it has already 
reached over and yanked out my 
earphones three times. But instinct 
takes over. I don’t hate children, I 

don’t want everyone to think I do, 
so I’ll force a smile and tolerate it, 
irrationally so, until the end of the 
flight or the little so-and-so dumps 
grape juice on my laptop, whichever 
comes first.

To the population of California 
who voted yes because you were 
convinced it served to preserve the 
welfare of your children, I hope in 
15 years they thank you for doing 
what you were most likely falsely 
convinced into thinking was best for 
them.  One thing I would like to wit-
ness, however, is that little girl  turn-
ing around to her parents and saying, 
“You claimed it was detrimental to 
my welfare to be exposed to same-sex 
marriage before I could understand 
it, yet you exposed me to it when you 
made me an unwilling participant in 
a campaign I neither understood nor 
supported.”

Finally, a note on morality: I 
find it hypocritical for organizations 
claiming to conserve moral and fam-
ily values in society to misappropri-
ate millions of dollars, to conduct a 
campaign of lies, with the intent of 
legalizing discrimination. But that’s 
just my opinion, and if they believe 
that they can rationalize their actions 
by taking a moral high ground and 
saying they are pursuing what they 
believe to be a moral cause, well, 
that’s called denial.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lazaro

this, dry up future private funding 
and the positive feedback that allows 
for attention and growth. According 
to UC Office of the President spokes-
man Ricardo Vazquez, proposed 
budget cuts may “force the campuses 
to turn to options like hiring more 
lecturers, keeping fewer ladder-rank 
faculty, reducing class offerings and 
increasing class sizes,” dragging the 
University of California far behind 
in the race for top honors among 
other research universities across the 
nation.

Increasingly tighter fiscal 
restraints could render us effectively 

unable to retain and attract students, 
as tuition and fees increase and the 
financially feasible quality of each 
UC location inevitably dwindles. 
These latest midyear cuts could result 
in the reduction of course sections, 
graduate programs and student men-
tal-health services — programs that 
leg-up public institutions such as the 
University of California with a com-
petitive chance against private intu-
itions with unlimited funding inlets. 

The university presently struggles 
to maintain competitive hiring pack-
ages for a star lineup of professors 
and researchers; Schwarzenegger’s 
additional cuts could leave the UC 

system operating at 10 percent less 
than its original 2008-2009 budget, 
placing us in an even darker corner 
of disadvantage, in less of a position 
to attract and retain distinguished 
faculty who give the system its cur-
rent edge. The pending midyear cuts 
pose a highly risky solution for the 
drought by halting our most prom-
ising source of economic stimulus 
and rejuvenation, further weakening 
a fundamental pillar of the state’s 
well-being and risking an even larger 
crisis for the horizon.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

BY GLORIA WUBy Gloria Wu • Contributing Writer

GETTING CONNE
T he typical college student can log on to Facebook to receive notice of a friend’s forgotten birthday, nomi-

nate Stephen Colbert for president and 
exchange electronic bumper stickers to 

display on a profile page. Now, using 
the Veechi application on Facebook, 
students from UCSD, UC Berkeley 
and UC Davis can also search for 

instructor ratings, reviews and grade 
distributions at their colleges.

Veechi Corporation launched 
its beta Facebook application on 
Oct. 26 to gain recognition and get 

feedback. Less than a week later, 
Veechi had amassed over 1,000 users 

and has continued to grow steadi-
ly. Additionally, the corporation has 

been in talks with with the UCSD Career 
Services Center for its first partnership.
Joining the many college success tools 

available to provide students with access to 
academic resources online, Veechi compiles 
supplements provided by programs such as 
RateMyProfessors.com, PostYourTest.com and 
UCSD’s Course and Professor Evaluations, 
which can all be obtained instantaneously 
with a few clicks of the mouse.

“We are leveraging the power of Facebook 
and [harnessing] that power of the social net-
work to the advantage of the students,” Veechi 
founder Abraham Shafi said.

With the anticipation of launching Veechi.
com — a Web site independent from the 
Facebook application — by Spring Quarter, 
the site’s UCSD campus representative Travis 
Lowe began searching for a partner to assist 
the site in facilitating career and internship 
information into their available services.

“When I walked into [the Career Services 
Center], the response was warm and interest-
ed, so we decided to move forward with UCSD 
first,” Lowe said. “The reason we decided to 
start the discussion here was that it would give 
us a background in how we would work with 
other campuses in the future.”

Located in Silicon Valley, the company 
is the brainchild of Shafi, who met Lowe at 
Diablo Community College before they trans-
ferred to separate universities. As the chief 
persuasion officer, Shafi gears Veechi to adapt 
to its target users; he promotes and recruits 
for the company. 

Veechi’s goal is to help students conquer 
college. The name itself originated from a 
Greek advertisement that caught Shafi’s eye 
when he visited New York City. The slogan 
of the advertisement was “Veni, Vidi, Vici,” 
the illustrious Latin phrase uttered by Julius 
Caesar that translates to “I came, I saw, I con-
quered.” The Veechi team plays on that phrase 
by embellishing the Facebook application with 

A fter midnight in the United States capital, when most of the nation was glued to their televisions and the Nov. 5 early morning 
editions of the Washington Post were hitting the 
racks, I found myself, a Republican, in a cheering 
mob of Democrats. 

Strangers met in the streets like old friends, 
hugging, clapping and crying together. If Oprah 
hadn’t been at Grant Park in Chicago she could 
have been leaning on someone next to me. A 

celebration of success poured out from D.C. bars, 
crowded the Washington streets and rallied in 
front of the White House. The future of the next 
four years had finally been decided with the elec-
tion of Barack Obama. 

UCDC students, usually off work on 
Tuesdays for our research seminar, filed out of 
the classroom on Election Day either headed to 
the streets to gauge the reaction of the city as the 
polls came in or to the Mayflower Hotel, where 
the Democratic National Committee was hold-
ing its election night party. The Obama sup-
porters — nearly everyone in the room — wore 
their buttons and T-shirts, excited and feverish 
in anticipation. The few Sen. John McCain (R-
Ariz.) supporters, weary of the insults they’d 
been bearing, gathered together to make a trip 
to the liquor store; they’d be drinking early.

CELEBRATING 
DEMOCRACY IN 
THE NATION’S 

CAPITAL
M eet the one restaurant worth blowing your paycheck on. It’s a gastronomical explo-sion, a dedicated-to-freshness haven of 
hearty, down-to earth dishes epitomizing multi-
cultural Californian cuisine. Unlike often-over-
priced, blandish La Jolla fare, it is 100 percent 
worth its upscaled prices.

Whisknladle (pronounced wisk-en-lay-del) 
redefines “fresh” — literally. When owner Arturo 
Kassel and executive chef Ryan Johnston took 
over in 2006, they changed the originally named 
“Fresh Seafood Restaurant” to “Fresh[er],” reflect-
ing their emphasis on serving only fresh, organic 
ingredients. Last January, the duo decided to 
remodel the eatery again to better match their 
philosophy: “You get out of  the pot, what you put 
into the pot.” 

Kassel and Johnston weren’t kidding. They take 
back-to-basics to the extreme, using only garden-
fresh ingredients from three local organic farms. 
From baking bread and smoking pork to churn-
ing ice cream and making mustard, Whisknladle 
chefs craft a multilayered tasting experience akin 
to home-cooked food from a master chef — e.g. if 
Wolfgang Puck was your mom. And if the celeb-
rity chef, like Kassel and Johnston, served only 
microbrews, hand-picked all wines (most under 
$60) and hand-built a four-foot by four-foot 
cedar-lined meat-curing room. 

This custom method of preparation is reflected 
in the balanced, tapas-style menu, which changes 
due to Kassel and Johnston’s “commitment to stay 
seasonal and cook on a whim.” The four-person-
worthy cutting board, a selection of savory house 
cured meats and flaky, nutty cheeses is a must-
have. A trio of butternut squash ravioli feels sur-
prisingly hearty, filled with creamy yellow squash 
and topped with smoky roasted chestnuts and 
sage. The slow-cooked lamb osso bucco almost 
melts off the bone, accented with rich coco beans 
and colorful mustard greens. Each bite is compli-
mented by a sip of lemon-and-cucumber flavored 
water, and Whisknladle’s fresh-baked French-
style bread is always abundant.

It’s Whisknladle’s attention to detail that ulti-

mately seals the deal. The understated-yet-
classy patio setup gains points for its scaled-
back touches: the single hanging lightbulbs, the 
wrought-iron woven chairs, the heated over-
head lamps. Earthy tones, simple white plating 
and new full-bar seating brings its amenities 
to a 360. Along with the impeccable service 
— waiters don’t pester you every moment, 
but fade in and out appropriately — there 
can be no possible rating but 10 out of 10 for 
ambiance.

Despite La Jolla prices in the range of 
$31 to $50 for a three-course meal — with 
appetizers ($8 to $18), entrees ($16 to $30) 
and dessert ($10) — Whisknladle proves 
its worth with local organic ingredients, 
thoughtful homestyle cooking and a taste-
ful, cozy atmosphere.

a Roman theme. At the top of the 
Web page, a small piece of Roman 
trivia is highlighted and changes 
every time the user refreshes the 
page. To draw people in, the team 
has developed a ranking system for 
each time a user writes a review or 
invites friends to join the applica-
tion. The user will then be given 
electronic Denarii, or Roman cur-
rency, which will eventually accu-
mulate. The amount of Denarii a 
user has will determine status in 
the Veechi community, which ranks 
from citizen to emperor. Surprises 
are promised for those at the top 
ranks.

However, students are less pre-
occupied with their Veechi status 
and more concerned with retrieving 
reviews about courses and instruc-
tors.

“I don’t like the [ranking] sys-
tem but I guess it helps that it has 
both reviews and grade distribu-
tions,” Revelle College freshman 
Kailin Duan said. “[Veechi] is pretty 
much the same as PickAProf.com. I 
don’t think it’s completely necessary 
to use, since it gets its information 
from other sources.”

Veechi provides the names of the 
toughest and easiest instructors on 
campus, including the grade ranges 
given by each instructor. Moreover, 
students can add reviews and rat-
ings of courses that they have taken 
in the past and view other students’ 
opinions on courses they are inter-
ested in taking in the future. The 
application also helps students find 
and get to know their classmates.

Currently, the beta application is 
performing its most basic functions: 
it is providing students with an aid 
to plot their academic courses. The 
Veechi team is focusing primarily 
on marketing strategies to spread 
the word across campuses. Veechi 
uses information already made pub-

lic by UCSD and relies on its users 
to keep it updated. The existing 
information is sparse, because the 
corporation is relying on resources 
already available for its users, some-
thing it hopes to change with pro-
spective partnerships.

“I think this could be a poten-
tially unique social platform that 
will be very positive for students,” 
Associate Director of the UCSD 
Career Services Center Craig 
Schmidt said after an initial meeting 
with Shafi. “There’s a lot of potential 
there to assist students in providing 

key resources.”
Veechi plans to launch its pro-

gram at every UC and California 
State University campus this winter.

“By the end of the year, we hope 
to reach the entirety of college sys-
tems in California, barring private 
schools,” Lowe said. Shafi expects 
that Veechi will continue to expand 
nationally and then internationally 
as long as the application remains 
relevant among college students.

At the moment, Lowe said 
Veechi is biding its time and wait-
ing to receive results from the three 
schools. He has been the driv-
ing force behind the negotiations 
between Veechi and the Career 

Services Center.
Veechi’s reputation currently 

relies mostly on word of mouth and 
Facebook invitations, but the team 
is working on buzz advertisements 
as well. 

Lowe and Shafi met with the 
UCSD Career Advisor Directors on 
Nov. 5 to discuss how they could 
utilize the Career Services Center’s 
resources.

Once Lowe and Shafi have gen-
erated enough users and informa-
tion, they will begin implementing 
the next step in their plan: provid-
ing employment opportunities for 
college students. They plan to use 
Veechi to help students make career 
decisions by choosing classes that 
could best prepare students for their 
desired career and then help them 
find appropriate employers. Veechi 
will help place students in intern-
ships or extracurricular activities 
that will assist them in making the 
most of their college years. Students 
would be able to contact employ-
ers through their Facebook applica-
tion, while employers could seek 
students from a separate account 
on the Veechi homepage; currently, 
this page only operates as a front 
that directs traffic to the Facebook 
application.

This is where their partnership 
with Career Services Centers on 
various college campuses will play 
a key role. However, at this point 
the UCSD Career Services directors 
say that it is premature to determine 
whether the center will partner with 
Veechi.

“At this point it’s too early to have 
any other kind of proclamation, 
but we certainly want to encourage 
them,” Schmidt said. “They have 
struck us as very creative and have 
definite possibilities.”

I went to work late that afternoon, 
deciding to stay at the MSNBC studios 
until every poll closed. But it was worth 
forgoing the early bar-time festivities to 
get updates through the flurry of news 
wires and NBC staff e-mails. When the 
wire came through that Obama was 
the 44th president of the United States, 
the information was listed as “hot” and 
embargoed by the network until the 
appropriate release time; I immediately 
called my mom, my roommates and a 
few friends from back home. As each 
person reported the outcome to which-
ever bar, club or party they were attend-
ing, I could hear cheers.

I tried to leave the studio around 
11:30 p.m. to join my friends for 
Obama’s victory speech at Hawk ’n’ 
Dove, a local bar on Capitol Hill, but my 
producer was convinced that none of 
the interns should walk back and after 
having my arm twisted, I was driven 
home in a black town car reserved 
for NBC’s big wigs. While the driver 
scrutinized me in the rearview mirror 
— trying to determine if I was related to 
an anchor or sleeping with one of them 
— I watched the crowds outside in the 
streets chanting, cheering and honking 
all the way to the White House. By the 
time I reached Pennsylvania Avenue it 
was so packed with people and vehicles 
that I had no choice but to walk. 

In front of the White House, my 
plans changed again. A small crowd 
outside the gates, holding Obama signs, 
yelled for President George W. Bush to 
start packing. “If you need help, Bushie, 
let me know, because you’ve got to 
go!” one woman shouted through the 
metal bars. A flood of people, marching 
directly from the DNC party down the 
street, made their way into the area.

Anticipating a large crowd, secu-
rity fences had been erected to section 
off Lafayette Park and the main gate, 

funneling the crowd in and around 
— but not close to — the driveway to 
the president’s front door. The snipers 
seemed to multiply in the minutes that 
I greedily snapped pictures, but there 
was no tension between the crowds and 
the police. I watched a group of men 
get overfriendly in their celebration, 
pushing and prodding the rest of the 
crowd, and I hurriedly moved out of the 
way expecting fists. When a few police 
officers arrived on the scene moments 
later, they exited their vehicles and after 
brief hesitation began hollering right 
alongside the revelers.

As the minutes wore on and Obama’s 
speech came to a close, a crowd that 
had once been 50 became 5,000, pep-
pered with teens and elderly; blacks and 
whites; high-ranking suited officials and 
average Joes in T-shirts. News stations, 
with bright lights and boom sticks, cap-
tured the entire event for the world to 
see; most of the reporters were foreign. 
The world was watching and the crowd 
loved it as they yelled and pumped their 
fists for the cameras. Eventually, one 
man started to sing “Na na na na, na na 
na na, hey, hey, hey, good-bye!” and the 
entire crowd serenaded President Bush 
until the lights of the White House were 
finally extinguished.

At the back of the park, cars slowed 
so that both driver and passengers could 
roll down their windows and shout in 
approval, earning high-fives from cou-
rageous crowd members who stole into 
the intersection. It was as if each person 
in the car, or on the sidewalk, or in the 
crosswalk, were personally responsible 
for bringing about change. Even I, a 
skeptic fiercely loyal to McCain, real-
ized that there’s something to say about 
a bombardment of car horns synchro-
nizing with the crowd’s cheer, “Yes we 
can,” and so I did what felt right — I 
danced along with the beat of the song 
the masses were singing.

them,” McManus said. “Why would 
you want to shoot with the pressure on 
you when you can apply it on them?”

That’s exactly what Belak-Berger 
was able to achieve, calmly netting 
UCSD’s first penalty kick into the top 
right corner. But the Tritons failed to 
match San Francisco State’s next two  
conversions, giving the Gators a 2-1 
advantage.

For UCSD’s fourth kick, 
Capobianco nailed the ball just past 
the outstretched arms of the Gator 
goalkeeper and into the right side 
of the goal, knotting the shootout 
up at two. Both teams then missed 
their fifth and final shots, sending the 
teams into sudden death.

McGovern delivered huge stop 
after huge stop during the do-or-die 
period, pulling a final block that made 
Belak-Berger’s second penalty goal the 
hard-fought match’s winning point.

In the longest game McManus has 
seen as a head coach, seniors Belak-
Berger and McGovern came through 
big.

“Jess [McGovern] did her job, 
which allowed me to play my role,” 

Belak-Berger said. “Pressure pushes 
you and I thrive on it by turning it into 
something positive.”

Belak-Berger and McGovern 
were respectively named the CCAA 
offensive and defensive players of the 
tournament, and honored with posi-
tions on the all-tournament team,  
along with Capobianco, Esquivel and 
Wethe.

McManus pointed out that dif-
ferent players have different roles — 
while it was the seniors who led the 
team to victory against San Francisco 
State, it was the freshmen who ended 
up coming through, accounting for 
two of the three goals against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills.

UCSD’s battle for the national title 
will begin later this week. Though the 
tournament’s details haven’t yet been 
revealed, McManus has his predic-
tions.

“I’m about 99 percent sure we’re 
going to be heading to Seattle,” he said. 
“We need to rest and get our heads 
right before we travel up there.”

your home crowd and think about all 
the great memories you’ve had playing 
in the gym over the past four years and 
then you realize that it’s over. You never 
think it’s going to come to an end — it 
just kind of sneaks up on you.”

In Thursday night’s game, UCSD 
improved to a 22-2 all-time record 
versus Cal State Stanislaus (6-22, 3-15 
CCAA), sweeping the Warriors 25-20, 
25-22, 25-19. Though the Tritons have 
seen success when up against California 
State teams in the past, the game started 
out a little rocky for the squad. 

The beginning of the first set fea-
tured nine tie scores and was higly con-
tested. The Tritons trailed 15-13 before 
rallying behind freshman outside hitter 
Hillary Williamson. Williamson served 
up an ace to give UCSD a two-point 
lead and then sent down two of the final 
three kills that allowed the Tritons to 
take game one. 

The Warriors took a 16-10 advan-
tage, apparently on their way to taking 
set two, when freshman outside hit-
ter Katie Condon led the Tritons to 
a seven-point run. UCSD managed a 
23-20 lead, and Schmidt and Bailey 
reinforced the win with back-to-back 
kills in the set’s last moments. 

The third and final set of the night 
remained close until kills by Condon 

and Schmidt put UCSD ahead 10-8. 
The closest the Warriors came to a 
comeback was at 13-12, but Williamson 
responded by sending down a kill and 
posting a block to stymie Cal State 
Stanislaus. The match ended with two 
final kills from Carpenter. Bailey led 
the way for the Tritons with 13 kills on 
.407 hitting, while Williamson chipped 
in 11 kills to complement her seven 
digs. 

After triumphing in their final home 
games of the season, the Tritons see 
their goal of winning a national cham-
pionship as a real possibility. With only 
two regular-season games remaining 
before playoffs begin, the team is up to 
the challenge. 

“Our team has trained so hard since 
the end of last season to prepare itself,” 
Torres said. “I know that we can beat 
any team in the country when we play 
our game, so we just need to approach 
our opponents with an aggressive and 
confident mentality and take care of 
business. We want to have fun, but 
more importantly, finish the season 
with no regrets.”

The Tritons will end the regular sea-
son on the road against Humboldt State 
Nov. 14 and Sonoma State Nov. 15.

my girls.” 
Overall, the UCSD women secured 

sixth place out of the 24 schools pres-
ent. 

“We had a great season,” head 
coach Nate Garcia said. “We had a 
good, developing group that continued 
to get better as we raced through; we 
came a little bit short on the race [on 
Saturday], but I’m really proud of the 
effort our women put in. Whenever 
you go in and face the best in the coun-
try, you’re going to face a challenge, 
and our girls faced it very boldly.” 

According to Montgomery, the sea-
son provided the harriers with a strong 
foundation for the future. 

“I’m optimistic because they’re a 
group of girls that are willing to work 
hard and push themselves,” she said. 
“They’re very selfless. I want to leave 
them with a great tradition — to enjoy 
it and run every race like it’s your last.”   

For Schofield and LeVieux, the 
cross-country journey will make one 
last exciting stop: Slippery Rock, Penn., 

where they will represent UCSD in 
the NCAA National Championships, 
scheduled for Nov. 22. 

Garcia said he hopes his runners 
will place within the top 30 and and 
earn an All-American award. 

“For our individuals going to 
nationals, we are looking to see them 
race better than they have in the past 
— to continue to develop their skills 
and abilities,” he said. “Any time you 
take an individual [to nationals] you’re 
looking to represent the West Region 
and [UCSD] well, and All-American 
status is definitely one of those ways.” 

With such a growing roster of tal-
ent, the upcoming cross country sea-
sons look bright for UCSD. 

“We have a good young group of 
folks who have great leadership in 
their older teammates,” Garcia said. 
“I anticipate that we are laying the 
groundwork for a lot great seasons to 
come.”

HOT CORNER

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 2008

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — In their 
final home series of the year, the UCSD 
women’s volleyball team swept consecu-
tive opponents Cal State Stanislaus and 
Chico State on Nov. 6 and Nov. 7. Prior 
to the match against Chico State, the 
seniors from UCSD’s squad were hon-
ored in front of 827 fans in a ceremony 
that commemorated their final colle-
giate match at RIMAC Arena. 

The team’s four seniors have all played 
pivotal roles in the UCSD Athletics 
program for the last few seasons, help-
ing make the squad and the univer-
sity a dominant force in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association.

“I felt that each one of us brought 
something new and unique to the 
team,” senior outside hitter Rebecca 
Bailey said. “I’ve gotten a lot closer with 
the team this year in particular, and 
it’s just been great getting to play with 
these girls.”

In the senior-night game on Friday, 
the No. 12 Tritons avenged a previous 
loss to the Chico State Wildcats (18-
10, 11-7 CCAA) earlier this season in 
straight sets 25-17, 25-21, 26-24. Senior 
setter Kacey Martinez warmed up early 
on, going 5-for-5 on assists to lead the 
UCSD offense in the first game. The 
Tritons gained a 10-4 lead and never 

looked back, pulling ahead by as many 
as seven points late in the set. The game 
ended on a kill by junior outside hitter 
Sylvia Schmidt — one of her 12 kills of 
the night. 

In the second game, the team 
jumped out to an early 7-2 advantage 
by forcing Chico State out of its normal 
high-speed offensive rhythm. UCSD 
never let up, holding an eight-point 
lead mid-set after an ace by junior set-
ter Elaine Chen. Despite a rally by the 
Wildcats that brought them within two 
points at 21-19, consecutive kills by 
Schmidt again ended the game in the 
Tritons’ favor. 

Chico State gained some early 
momentum in the third set, leading 
10-8 after a back-and-forth beginning. 
After several even scores and lead 
changes, the Tritons were behind 22-18 
before senior outside hitter Kimberly 
Carpenter stepped in. After a kill, she 
served up two consecutive points for 
the Tritons and evened the score at 
22. A service ace by Schmidt and two 
errors by the Wildcats topped off the 
sweep for UCSD. Bailey ended with a 
total of 12 kills while Carpenter came 
out with seven. 

“It’s definitely a bittersweet feeling,” 
senior defensive specialist Michelle 
Torres said. “You look around and see

WOMEN’S SOCCER — For the seventh time in 
nine years, the No. 20 Tritons hold the esteemed 
title of California Collegiate Athletic Association 
Champions.

 The team took back control of one of the 
toughest conferences in the nation with a 3-1 
domination over Cal State Dominguez Hills in 
the CCAA finals on Nov. 9. The win came on the 
heels of an emotional, penalty-kick victory against 
San Francisco State on Nov. 7 in the semifinals.

 The state championship will take the Tritons 
national, earning them an automatic bid into the 
NCAA Division II Championships, set to begin 
Nov. 13. UCSD awaits the announcement of the 
final, 48-team lineup — which will arrive today 
by 2 p.m. — for a better idea of when, where and 
who they will be playing.

 After sneaking by San Francisco State in the 
semifinals, the Tritons charged into what they 
knew would be a highly physical match against 
Cal State Dominguez Hills.

 Senior Natasha Belak-Berger was proud of 
the team’s composure throughout the brutal face-
off.

 “Everyone got knocked down and got up 
more than any other game this season,” she said.  
“[CSUDH] was pushing with everything they 
had, and we just had to weather the storm. ”

 As bodies flew at seemingly every battle for 
possession, the Triton offense got the push it des-
perately needed when freshman midfielder Anne 
Wethe scored her first goal of the season only 10 
minutes into the game. The goal broke a streak 
of nearly 350 minutes of scoreless play for UCSD.

 Up 1-0, the Tritons saw their second goal of 
the match off the foot of another freshman. This 
time, it was midfielder Courtney Capobianco, 
who found the back of the net after receiv-
ing a pass from fellow freshman forward Sarah 
McTigue and flipping the ball over the Toro 
goalie. Like Wethe before her, Capobianco’s goal 
was her first of the season.

 Knowing its season was on the line, CSUDH 
came out firing in the second half, cutting the 
deficit to one with a score in the 63rd minute.  

Senior goalkeeper Jessica McGovern rushed out 
from the net to meet the Toro offenders, but was 
instead forced to watch the ball soar just over her 
head and bounce into the goal.

 The Tritons fell back into power when senior  
forward Kelly Mayo — dribbling the ball through 
the box — was clipped from behind by a CSUDH 
defender, who was carded for the foul play. Belak-
Berger nailed her third penalty kick of the tourna-
ment to give the team a 3-1 lead.

 Despite being outshot 15-13 during the 
match, UCSD found itself with far more scoring 
opportunities than usual — an area in which the 
team has struggled over its last five matches. 

 “We just kept doing the same thing that we 
were doing,” head coach Brian McManus said.  
“You go through three or four games where 
you can’t buy a bit of luck, but it comes back. 
We’ve had opportunities but were unable to finish 
— and today, we finished.”

 The players could have used little of that 
offensive luck against San Francisco State in the 
CCAA semifinals: The Gators and Tritons battled 
for 110 minutes without a single goal, despite 
chances on both sides of the field.

 UCSD’s most promising set-up arrived in the 
final seconds of the game’s first overtime, when 
senior defender Amanda Esquivel lofted the ball 
across the field to Belak-Berger, who strode past 
the sleeping Gator defense to knock a shot past 
the keeper and barely over the goal line. 

Both the team and its supporters went wild on 
false hopes that the Tritons had captured the vic-
tory — but the referee soon whistled otherwise, 
claiming the ball had entered the goal seconds 
after the game’s official end.

Belak-Berger said that after the call was made, 
she fell to the ground in exhaustion and disap-
pointment.

“I wish it would’ve counted,” she said. “It was 
a long game and everyone was physically tired. I 
had to pick myself up and keep playing.”

UCSD won the shootout coin toss and elected 
to shoot first, challenging the traditional belief 
that kicking second is advantageous.

“I’m a big believer in putting pressure on

LADY TRITONS SWEEP 
FINAL HOMESTAND

Harrier Duo Races to Nationals 
By Brianna Lee
Staff Writer

CROSS COUNTRY— Competing in 
their most critical event of the season, 
the UCSD cross country teams bolted 
out their best efforts on Nov. 8 during 
the NCAA West Regional, attempting 
to score a returning trip to the NCAA 
National Championships. In the end, 
however, the Triton harriers came up 
short to powerful rivals such as Chico 
State University and Seattle Pacific 
University, neither the men’s nor the 
women’s team able to qualify for the 
Division II National Championships. 

In spite of the meet’s disappoint-
ment, the Tritons maintain their hope 
in senior Jake LeVieux and sophomore 
Bre Schofield, selected to represent 
UCSD at nationals. 

The men’s team faced some surpris-
ing adversity early on when the 10,000-
meter race was interrupted and later 
rescheduled due to miscommunication 
and erroneous turn-navigating during 
the course run. According to senior Jake 
LeVieux, the setback negatively affected 
the runners, as some of their momen-
tum was considerably shaved off by 
the botched first attempt. Nevertheless, 
LeVieux finished strong, seizing 14th 
place overall with a time of 33:41. 
Next in line was senior Gabe LaMothe 
(34:04), junior Mike Wright (35:39) and 
freshman Jeremy Riley (35:55), claim-
ing 18th, 45th and 51st place, respec-
tively. Ultimately, UCSD would place 

seventh in a pool of 18 schools.
According to LeVieux, the team 

drew from its ability to refocus its efforts 
and regroup. 

“We had a really positive outlook 
right before our second time,” he said. 
“That was really important because it’s 
hard to get back into your game.” 

The Tritons were also aided by their 
superior knowledge of the UCSD home 
course, allowing the harriers to race 
with confidence. 

“We’ve run [the course] so many 
times that we are so used to it,” LeVieux 
said.  “Mentally we know what to do at 
every turn and we know what to expect. 
We don’t have to think about the course 
at all — it’s second nature.”    

For the women’s 6,000-meter run, 
Schofield powered through the pack 
to garner a fifth-place finish at 21:44. 
Close behind came teammates senior 
captain Ashleigh Montgomery (23:26) 
and freshman Elena Inouye (24:09), 
earning 27th and 51st place, respec-
tively. 

“I prepared myself fully for this 
race,” Schofield said. “The number-one 
thing I find myself doing is keep push-
ing, because if I take my foot off that 
pedal, then I know I won’t be doing my 
hardest … All throughout the whole 
season we’re there for each other. With 
that support, I have [to race well] for
