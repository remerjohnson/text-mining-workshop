NEWS EDITOR 

This week's special election, which 
could determine whether or not stu-
dents will overturn the A.S. Council's 
ban on sexual nudity on Student-Run 
Television. represents over implifica-
tion of a complex issue. according to 

acting A i tant Vice Chancellor of 
Student Life Gary R. Ratcliff. 

But what is simple enough. he 
aid, is the one and only administra-

tive demand for the return of SRTV: 
"We don't want to see 'graphical 

depictions of exual nudity;' he aid. 
"We won't part from that. and we 
want to see that in the charter:' 

That requirement is controver-
sial because SRTV will not agree to 
its inclusion in a new station char-
ter. according to station co-Manager 
Andrew Tess. Although he is cur-
rently negotiating terms of a rewritten 
charter with a newly appointed SRTV 
task force. Tess aid that his mentality 

has changed since the release of 544 
pages of e-mails documenting admin-
istrator ' internal conversation about 
the station. 

"Tho e e-mails confirmed my sus-
picions about what the administra-
tion was thinking;' he said. "They 
were trying to get the A.S. to do the 
dirty work for them while they were 
scrambling to find out what exactly 
was going on with SRTY." 

In early October, the A.S. Council 
rejected an amendment that would 
have banned sexual nudity on the

GREENLIGHT 

TRANSFER 
HOUSING 

Dynes substituted 
compensation for a 
sabbatical earned at her 
last university. He now 
defends the decision.

ASSOCIATE N~WS EDITOR 

In the face of an investigation into 
the university's pay practices called 
for by the UC Board of Regents at 
a meeting last week, University of 
California administrators stood by 
their 2004 decision to award $248,000 
in previously undisclosed compen-
sation to UCSD Chancellor ~ 
Anne Fox, which brought her total 
pay lut year to nearly $700,000. 

The $248.000 was part of a deal 
between Fox and UC President 
Robert C. Dynes to honor sabbati-
cal time Fox had accrued in her 

previolls position at North Carolina 
State Vniver ity, the an Diego 
Union-Tribune reported last week. 
Originally. Fox's official salary was 
$350,000. 

Although the university has been 
under fi re in recent months after 
reports in the San Francisco Chronicle 
revealed it awarded more than $870 
million last year to top executives 
in addition to their base pay, the 
university defended Fox's sabbatical 
stipend. 

·Consistent with practice at other 
universities, when UC recniits a 
senior academic administrator, such 
as a chancellor, UC honors (and thus, 
agrees to fund) the sabbatical leave 
credits he [or) she has earned elIe-
where; UC spokesman Paul Schwartz 
stated in an e-mail. 

On Jan. 18, the regents convened 
at UCSD to re-examine salary poli-
cies and decided that after a univer-
sity-commissioned audit is complete 

it could expect a major overhaul of 
tho e procedures, especially in the 
area of pay transparency. 

W1!ile regents ~ontinue to call for 
full public disclosure of university 
pay records, Regent John ). Moores, 
who was the chairman of the Board 
of Regents at the time Fox was hired. 

. told the Union-Tribune that he was 
completely unaware of Fox's sabbati-
cal payment. 

"It's disappointing to learn there 
was a package put together that I 
didn't know about; Moores told the 
Union-TrIbune. 

The university. however. empha-
sized that Dynes did not act outside 
of university-approved policy when 
authorizing Fox's additional compen-
sation. 

"Some components of an appoin-
tee's employment terms require 
approval by and/or reporting to the 
regents; othen do not," Schwartz 
stated. -This one did not." 

The-
upcoming 
three-phase 
audit and 
the Board 
of Regents' 
newly cre-
ated com-
pen sa tion 
committee 
will inves- Marye Anne Fox 
tigate the appropriateness of com-
pensation for the top 32 executive 
positions in the university. The audit 
will also determine whether regents 
were ·properly informed about and 
approved of the salaries earned by 
the incumbents of those positions.

UC faculty handbook. is given to

The autonomous government 

of Catalonia in the country of 
Spain has awarded UCSD ocean-
ographer Paul Dayton the first of a 
new cla ~s of eco logy prizes. 

The government gave Dayton 
Ihe new ly developed Ramon 
Margalef Pri ze in Ecology and 
Environmental Sciences, which 
included a monetary award of 
$100,000, in a ceremony in 
Barce lona on Jan . 18. 

A group of sci€ntists from 
Cata lon ia, the European Union 
and the interna tional ecology 
community chose to recogni ze 
Dayton for hi s research, which 
has revo lutionized the enti re fie ld 
of ecology. 

As a researcher at Sc ripps 
Insti tution of Oceanography for 
the past 35 yea rs, Dayton has 
conducted research on coastal 
and estuarine habitats, and has 
documented the effects of over-
fis hing and EI Nino on coastal 
habitats, especially kelp forests .

Sexual Harrassment 
Equal Between Genders 

Accord ing to a new report 
released by the Ameri can 
Association of University Women, 
nea rly two-thirds of both male and 
female students experience some 
form of sexual harassment during 
the ir college experie nce. 

Men and women were a lmost 
equa lly likely to experience sexual 
harassment, with 61 percent of 
men and 62 percent of women 
reporting an encounter. 

An inte rnational team of c hem-
ists from UCLA and the University 
of Bologna in Ita ly announced 
that it has developed a molecu-
lar motor smaller than the eye 
can see. The device is the size of 
a nanometer and is powered by 
sun light. 

The report revealed that female 
students are more likely to be the 
target of sexual jokes, comme nts, 
gestu res or looks, while male stu-
dents are more likely to be ca lled 
gay or have messages about them 
posted on the Internet. 

The study also found that 
women are more likely than men 
to change their behavior as a result 
of a sexual -harassment experi-
ence.

Senators Reach Boiling Point 
in Rare, Pensive Meeting 

Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Recruit 

T he 17th A.S. Council meeting of the year began with a hos-tile and uneasy air. as tensions 
over Student-Run Television, the cam-
puswide special election and recently 
released administrator e-mails spilled 
over into public input. 

. Thurgood Marshall College sopho-
more Eddie Herrera spoke regarding 
a resolution that would bestow the 
council's support for his organization, 

Some senators said that. although 
they supported the idea on an ideologi-
cal level. that they were not sure exactly 
how the organization would work, or 
what effect the resolution would ulti-
mately have. Herrera, believing the 
council misunderstood the purpose of 
the organization, spoke in opposition 
to the points made by those senators. 

"Were not asking for authority to 
do ce.rtain things, only moral support:' 

he said.

However, the 
council ultimately 
ruled against the 
organization, vot-
ing to table the item

lution. "seeks to

of the council's actioos.n The item had 
been rejected in internal committee, 
which voted by an 8-1-1 vote to tabJe it 
indefinitely, but it would later become 
a topic of heated debate OIl the council 
tloor. 

Never shying away from controver-
sy, Earl Warren College senior DuIieI 
Watta appeared with several e-mails 
from campus administrators regarding 
the SRTV scandal, published by the 
GIUII'dian. 

"These are just a few I found funny." 
Watts said, before reading excerpts 
from e-mails by, among others, acting 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student 
Life Gary R. RatcWf and Chancellor 
Maryc Anne Fen. 

Things were relatively calm until 
the council began consideration of old 
business, when tempers flared over 
Herrera's resolution and opposition to 
it by certain senators. 

"I think there always needs to be 
an oversight, but I think it needs to 
be fair and balanced," A.S. President 
Cbrbtopber SweeteD said. 

Freshman Senator 
Jooathan Hkbo. the only vote in 
favor of the resolution, was visibly 
upset by the council's decision. 

"This is absolutely ridiculoU$~ 
Hicken said, leaving the room after the 
vote, never to return. 

However. the most debated topic 
of the evming proved to be four fund-
ing requests from "subcommittees" of 
the Muslim Student Association, and 
whether or not the council should fund 
each one the usuaJ $400 maximum to 
attend the same conference. 

Although some senators on the 
finance committee argued that the 
similarities between the organizations 
were "fishy," others said that the full 
funding should be allocated because 
the organizations were properly reg-
istered and follOMd the application 
instructions correctly. 

Ultimately, all subcommittees were 
funded the full amount by a 15-6-1 
vote, with a few senatOfll claiming that 
they would be taking a closer look 
at finance committee bylaws in the 
upcoming weeks.

University liberals 
clash with military 
recruiters' policy 
against openly gay 
soldiers. 

By Sam Thomas 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

In the military, the "don't ask, 
don't tell" policy for gays is as com-
monp�ace as the phrase "hoo-ah.n The 
Supreme Court is putting a spotlight 
on it as justices mull a case that pits 
recruiters against colleges that call the 
military policy discriminatory. 

ANALYSIS 
At stake is the Solomon 

Amendment. which restricts federal 
funding for universities' that ban mili-
tary recruiters from their campuses. 

In December, a coalition of 36 Jaw 
schools challenged the amendment 
before the Supreme Court, and was 
met by a hesitant and sometimes 
argumentative bench. 

"I wasn't optimistic going in, and I 
surdy wasn't going out," said Michael 
Rooke-Ley, former president of the 
Society of American Law Teachers. 
one of the plaintiffs in the case. 

A court decision to uphold the 
law could set off campus protests, 
according to Roou-Ley. The trend 
has aIready begun at the University of 
California. where last spring. a career 
fair at UC Santa Cruz was disrupted 
by protests against the military's ban 
on open homosexuals. 

While UCSD has had a less torrid 
history with the policy, students have 
been active when military recruit-
ers come to campus, UCSD Lesbian,

Director Shaun Travers said last fall. 
The problem is not about pro-

tests but about access. according to 
Solicitor General Paul D. Clement. 
who represented the Department of 
Defense in the Supreme Court case. 
Confrontation with military recruit-
ers on campus would not violate the 
Solomon Amendment, but barring 
them would, he said.

ment to the National Defense 
Authorization Act in 1995 as a

response to anti-discrimination poli-
cies enacted often decades earlier by 
some univasities. 

UCSD Career Services Director 
Andrew Ceperley said that protests at 
campus job fairs are not problematic, 
with no attempts made to block stu-
dents' access to the recruiting stands. 

During the court hearing. Clement 
questioned whether recruitment COll-
stituted a speech issue. 

The schools' case is built on a 2000 
Supreme Court ruling in which jus-
tices said forcing Boy Scouts to accept 
openly gay scoutmasters would vio-
late the group's free speech rights. 

"I think, with respect to what the 
military itself wants, it simply does 
not want I what is] primarily a speech 
activity to take place, it wants access 
for recruiting. which is a traditional 
commercial enterprise,n Clement 
said. 

On one of the few occasions that E. 

Joshua Rosenkranz, the lawyer argu-
ing on behalf of the schools, was able 
to complete a sentence without inter-
ruption from the bench, he insisted 

. that the schools' First Amendment 
right to academic freedom was being 
violated. 

"The problem with [the] Solomon 
Amendment is that the unconstitu -
tional-conditions doctrine says that 
you can't put a private speaker to that 
crisis of conscience;' he said. 

Newly installed ChiefJustice John 
Roberts rejected this claim, arguing 
that schools are free to deny access to 
recruiters. 

"You're perfectly free to do that if 
you don't take the moneY,' he said. 

The amendment complicates 
a school's hopes to uphold both its 
ethical principles and financial sup-
port of research, and could hold large 
implications for all UC campuses, 
according to UC General Counsel 
Steven Rosen. 

KThe government could argue 
that an 'institution of higher educa-
tion' under the relevant federal law 
extends to an entire university sys-

tem~ he said last fall "In theory, 
the entirety of UC's research funding 
could be jeopardized by one campus 
denying access to recruiters:' 

However, UC Davis law professor 
Tobias Wolff said that the court's deci-
sion does not need to have a signifi-
cant impact on a school's freedom. 

"If they rule I to uphold the 
Solomon Amendment]. myexpecta-
tion and hope is that they will write 
a narrow opinion that will not have 
broad implications for other impor-
tant values. like academic freedom,n 
he said. "The type of intrusion that 
the law schools claimed in this case is 
very different from interference with 
the curriculum or the classroom:'

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Michael Capparelli 

It's going to be a slow day on Capitol Hill 

When Paternal Administrators, Ignorant 
Alumni and Hedonistic Students Rumble 

By Marianne Madden 
OPINION EDITOR 

On one hand, the SRTV porn controversy that students are voting on this week has 
grown tiresome and overpublicized. 
It was a waste of time and resources 
from the start. On the other, the vari-
ous words and incidents that this con-
troversy have spawned reveal much: 
U~m~~are~ 
paternal; ~ university is tom between 
Apollonian and Dionysian dements 
that make the student experience 
confusingly schizophrenic; and when 
prudish administrators, misinformed 
alumni and ·concerned citizens~ arbi-
trate taste on a college campus, no 
one wins. 

As Chancdlor Marye Anne Fox 
attempted t9 weave a moderate course 
between students, the A.S. Council, 
SRTV's managers and the administra-
tion, a flurry of angry e-mails streamed 
in from all comers of the country. 
The Guardian obtained these e-mai1s 
via a CaIifomja Public Records Act 
request. Choice e-mails, ringing with 
the oounds of misinfonnation and 
overreaction, read: 

"I am by no means a prude, but this 
definitely crosses the line .. . I am dis-
appointed, however, that as the leader 
of a PUBLIC university being aided 
by PUBLIC funds that you would 
condone this immature, exploitative 
maneuver and just let them handle it:' 

"r am stunned to learn that my tax 
doUars are being spent to broadcast 
a porn show on the university TV 
. .. My teenagers will not be applying 
to your school and I am urging my 
friends who are alums not to suppon 
what you call a university of learn-
ing. Unfortunately I forsee [sic] UCSD 
becoming the university of porn and 
its credibility as a place of higher 
learning will be ruined:' 

"[ have two 4.0 students interested 
in a medical career. Your college will 
not even be a consideration if student 
media porn is allowed under your 
command. I don't care if this is a 
student issue or not. Who's in charge 

anyway?~ 
These letters would pack more 

wallop if the writers had a decent grip 
on the facts. Despite what Fox News 
and MSNBC reponed, SRTV is not 
funded by tax doUars. Rather, student 
activity fees fund the station, to the 
tune of $9,000 a year, or a few dozen 
cents per student per year. A few stu-
dents complained after the porn was 
aired this year, and were refunded 

•• , , .. . If • . , • f lI,., 

their portion of fees that went toward 
the station. The fact that so many 
people continue to scream about tax 
dollars. while media outlets like the 
GII4rdian have doggedly worked to 
dispel this myth, reveals that such 
"concerned citizens" only care about 
airing their entrenched views about 
porn, not about educating themselves 
about the unique facts of. this case. 

Secondly, these e-mail writers seem 
to be 1aboring under the impression 
that threatening to withdraw dona-
tions or dissuade a coUple of students 
from applying to UCSDwou\dhurt the 
uniwersity enough to make Chancdlor 
Fox adopt a more hard-line, proactive 
approach. Ab, if only these writers 
realized that the chump change of 
alwnni donations is trumped by the 
multirnillion-do11ar research grants on 
which U~D relies. 

D is very good 
punishing its 

students for being 
young and in coBege. 

The shutdown of 
SRTV is only the 

latest symptom of this 
di " sease. 

But these e-mails aren't just amus-
ing for their slippery grip on the truth . 
Are there any better illustrations of 
generational differences in America 
than the differing reactions to a bit 
of smut? The average UCSD student 
didn't see the broadcast when it aired, 
and merely shrugged and sighed when 
the news blew up and Fox News trucks 
showed up near Library Walk. For 
good or for bad, porn simply doesn't 
rile up the average student. It only riles 
up the older generation. 

When parents and administrators 
attempt to arbitrate taste, they must 
realize that college students are the 
most enthusiastic consumers of the 
most lowbrow entertainment America 
has to offer. And we're proud of it. A 
good portion of American entertain-
ment is geared toward us, and it push-
es the envelope of acceptability, racial 
sensitivity, modesty and taste. Would 
these angry e-mail writers - and 
UCSD's administrators - be shocked 
to learn that any UCSD student can 

easily access Internet porn of a much 
more explicit variety than what was 
aired on SRTV? And do it for free, 
privately, in their campus residence? 

The firestorm that grew around 
this airing is especia1Iy absurd when 
considered within the context of the 
tastelessentertainment college students 
consume every day. The phenomenaI.-
Iy popular Web site Co11egehumor. 
com, for enmple, is popu1ar partly for 
its user-submitted photographs featur-
ing college girls baring breasts (and 
sometimes other body parts) painted 
with their university name and, often, 
Greek letters. 

Perhaps ~ response to the airing 
was so contradictory and polarized 
- even among students, as a few 
Christians came out of the wnodWlJlk 
to profess their · disgust - because 
UCSD is strung taughtly between the 
the blandly upstanding Apollo and the 
bedonistlc Dionysus. In "The Birth of 
'I'ragedy.' Nietzsche speaks of the two 
pillars of Greek culture: the rational, 
temperate Apollonian and its oppo-
site, the Dionysian, which represents 
ecstasy, enthusiasm, drunkenness and 
madness. RSOs, adminlstrat~ and 
professors exhort us to stick with the 
Apollonian; meanwhile, the Dionysian 
lurks beneath the surface, bobbing 
up when a keg is tapped, or some-
one streaks across a field, or - gasp! 
- has sex, or defends our right to see 
a risque show on the student-run tele-
vision station. The average UCSD stu-
dent is torn between two pronounced 
extremes created by a crueUy bizarre 
campus culture and selective e.nforce· 
ment of rules. 

U~D is very good at punishing 
its students for being young and in 
coUege. The shutdown ofSRTV is only 
the latest symptom of this disease. 
Maybe such punishment is fun; in 
the e-mails obtained by the Guardian, 
Gary Ratcliff, Joe Watson and Nick 
Aguilar seemed to have quite a time 
working out the ways in which SRTV 
could be student-run in name only, 
and how best to censor and prescreen 
the channel's programming. 

These concerned administra-
tors fail to realize, or remember, that 
coDege students will always take joy 
in opposing authority - the more 
repressive rules become, the more we 
will rebel. The fun of airing porn 
on SRTV ~uld disappear as soon 
as administrators stop caring about 
it. After all, there is no demand for 
mediocre, homegrown pornography 
when much higher-quality smut can 
be found for free OD the Internet.

When 'Reality' Isn't, Readers and 
Viewers Must Be Skeptics 

so okay, I rarely get around to the extracurricular reading of so-called serious boob. But 
even my ign'ant ass noticed earlier 
this month when the book indus-

its label Many readers of Frey's 
bonk claim they realized it wasn't 
true a few pages in. But as the 
popularity of these forms proves, 
no one cares. It's not our job as 

consumers to try went berserk 
over a mighty 
precious little 
detail, proving 
what a turbulent 
ripple a little tri-
fle like truth can 
make. 

iPorton 
Random 

bother think-
ing about the 
subtleties of 
"reality- when 
we're supposed 
to be having a 
good time. 

A prince of 
these literary 
times, the highest-selling, Oprlh-
lauded ex-addict author of lut 
year, James Frey, turned out to be a 
fake. Many of the events of the 50-
called memoir of Frey's effusive-
ly drugged-out and crime-prone 
youth, "A Million Little Pieces,- are 
considerably fuzzier than merely 
embellished history. They are basi-
cally complete fiction. 

Not so shocking: Frey's book 
- originally shopped to publishers 
as a work of fiction - didn't sell 
at first. So Frey reworked it, sup-
posedly taking out the untruthful 
parts, sent it to Doubleday, and got 
a $50,000 advance. I sure would 
[ove to see how Frey or his law-
yer managed to draw a rhetorical 
line between truth and fiction in 
a piece of literature - a line that, 
with these revelations, only seems 
to matter less to us. 

In this era's best-seller recipe, 
the plot is the tasty meat. The "real-
ity" label is just the MSG-laden 
sauce. 

Which is why the public isn't as 
outraged as some journalists are 
about the total fictions in Frey's 
memoir. I confess that I haven't 
read it, but I get the sense that the 
book - in which Frey racks up 
14 arrests, recounts blood/urine/ 
vomit/spit-soaked airplane rides, 
running over a cop while driving 
drunk and beating up a priest who 
sexually assaulted him when Frey 
was on his way to commit suicide 
in Paris' Seine river - relies on 
an unfazed presentation of a sen-
sational plot more than depth or 
aesthetically advanced technique 
to hook the reader. 

As pan of the same soaking 
of plot into a spicy sauce, reality 
television works exactly the wne 
way, and achieves probably about 
the same adherence to actual truth. 
I naively assume that everyone who 
watches it realizes that much of it is 
constructed, scripted and drama-
tized by the producers and editors 
to a point of seriously challenging 

Let's do it 
anyway. 

Reality TV and Reality Fiction 
(haha) aren't supposed to be about 
actual reality in the end; they mere-
ly employ it as a device to enrich 
the viewing/reading experience. 
There isn't a label at the bottom 
of your screen saying "this reaIly 
happened." Jeff Probst doesn't say, 
·we'll be right back on our real 
island with our real people to con-
tinue our real contest," before every 

he thrill of true 
stOries is that wire

ourselves to their 

characters more easily, 
to judge them more 

quickly, and thus 
to have a stronger 

emotional reaction to 
their lives and to the 

message (if any) of the 
narrative as a whole?' 

commercial break to make sure 
you know. 

The reality in reality TV is 
constructed by the way the story 
is told - the documentary fUm 
style, the intersplicing of interview 
footage, the creation of elaborate 
formal ceremonies where "reality," 
in effect, catches up with the char-
acters. 

The judgment is the most 
important part, after all. What that 
"reality" label achieves for televi-
sion, more than anything, is the 
thoughtless and instant transposi -
tion of the viewer into the action of 
the scene. Because all the charac-

tees are presumably real (and even 
if the situations are admittedly 
less than), the viewer can imagine 
himself exactly In the scene as it 
unfolds and can therefore judge 
the characters and their actions 

b~ed on what we believe our own 
would be. 

Think about it. The fun of sit-
com fiction (I've heard) is the char-
acters doing the same silly, stupid 
things in all different situations. 
We don't judge them for being 
immoral or unfaithful or superfi-
cial - we enjoy the freedom of it. 

Conversely, the thrill of true 
stories is that we're able to compare 
ourselves to their characters more 
easily, to judge them more quickly, 
and thus to have a stronger emo-
tional reaction to their lives and to 
the message (if any) of the narra-
tive as a whole. 

In the case of Frey's memoir, 
written in the past tense, with . 
judgment and reality having been 
sentenced and served, we are sup-
posed to believe in his transforma-
tion. Frey has turned his supposed 
life story into a platform for his 
own faith-based addiction rehabili-
tation philosophy, aimed squarel~ 
against programs like Alcoholics 
Anonymous, called "Will to 
Power." 

Reality television usually takes 
smaller bites. For it, the "true" 
label is like a license to turn up 
the volume on the maddening 
everyday trifles of modern life, 
things too petty and domestic for 
serious fiction or film to dwell 
on. It uses its own crude, docu-
mentary storytelling style to get 
away with spending hours observ-
ing been -there celebrities struggle 
with weight loss or interviewing 
insecure twentysomethings about 
which roommate stuck their finger 
in the peanut butter. 

Amazingly, dramatizations of 
the small battles of basic social life 
survive public knowledge of their 
profou nd exaggeration; whether or 
not Frey's book will is yet to be 
determined - although I think 
its safe to say his self-help school 
(where the real money is these 
days) won't be graduating a class 
anytime soon . 

But his story, along with the rise 
of reality TV, show that instead of 
getting suckered into the treacher-
ous whirlpool of wholly accept-
ing televised drama or literature 
as truth, the only sane course of 
understanding for modern expres-
sion is to heanily disbelieve every-
thing, and enjoy it anyway. 

OPINION 5 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR-
Argument Against 
SRTV is Laughable 

Dar EdItor: 
It is not too surprising the sample 

ballot for this week's special election 
gave me more laughs than an episode 
of "Koala 1Y.' The-"No· side not only 
doesn't even bother dealing with the 
issues at hand in its statements, but 
omits some very important details. 

Student-Run Television will not be 
returned to the air if this ban is upheld; 
administrat~ have made it dear that 
the station will only be returned if all of 
their conditions are met. While some 
of the demands are reasonable. others 
are not. Perhaps most important of 
these, along with the continued ban 
on ·graphical sexual depictions" is the 
creation ~ a program review board to 
awn- all new programming. This is 
prior restraint, an illegal and absolutely 
unnecessary form of censorship that 
will destroy the ability of students to 
get involved with SRTY. Considering 
that the A.S. Council funds all other 
media under "content neutrality.' why 
it is willing to create a board that 
can kick off current and new pro-
grams under Mcommunity standards" 
remains a mystery. Programming will 
be banned unless scheduled a week in 
advance. Does that sound reasonable? 

My banishment from SRTV was 
not because of my decision to focus 
on Thurgood Marshall College senior 
Kate Pillon's blatantly hypocritical 
actions in my crude, satirical fashion 
during that particular video segment, 
as the "No~ side alleges. [t was only 
over the airing of sexual material. If 
our elected members felt so strongly 
about this "hateful attack.» why did 
they not pass legislation to prohibit 
any future "attacks" and focus solely 
on porn? How my adult entenainment 
constitutes "hate speech~ is beyond 
me. The author's choice to focus on 
"hate speech" and "Jizzlam~ from three 
years ago (before I was ever involved 
with the Koala) shows how weak their 
position is; they need to rest on highly 
emotional talking points with no dis-
cussion to support their positions. 

Most laughable is the word "stu-
dent" capitalized in every occurrence. 
When 70 students and community 
members attended the Oct. 26 A.S. 
Council meeting and overwhelmingly 
reacted against the council's impend-
ing legislation, they were ignored by 
many members of the council. Why 
the word "students" is purposely capi-
ta\ized to suggest: a form of identity, yet 
real students are not shown the same 
attention is beyond me. 

"Don't let one person ruin SRTV 
for everyone"? With weU over 2,000 
signatures gathered to call this special 
election, [ can Proudly say that enough 

students feel this is an issue pivotal 
enough to risk "ruining" SRTV. The 
A.S. Council took SRTV off in the 
first place during a political talk show; 

. instead of being slaves to every whim 
of the administration, it should have 
thought of the consequences of its 
actions in the first place as I had. 

I encourage UCSD to come out 
and vote this week; if you ask those of 
us with the ·Yes" side a tough ques-
tion or criticize us, unlike our elected 
representatives, we will not puU the 
plug on you. .

Bush ignoring 
American people 

Dar EdItor: 
Is President George W. Bush, hi~ 

administration or the Republican 
Congress responsive to the wishes of 
the American people? Recent surveys 
reveal that a majority of Americans 
(55 percent) think the war in Iraq 
is a mistake and that we should get 
out Sixty-five percent want single-
payer health care and are willing to 
pay more taxes to get it. Sixty percent 
favor repealing Bush's tax cuts that go 
primarily to the rich. Sixty-six percent 
want to reduce the deficit, not by cut-
ting domestic spending, but by reduc-
ing defense spending or raising taxes. 
Seventy-seven percent think we should 
do "whatever it takes" to protect the 
environment. Eighty-seven percent 
think big oil companies are gouging 
consumers and support impOSition of 
a windfall profits tax. 

Are government officials respon-
sive to the people of America? What is 
your conclusion?

Tess Will Not Bow to University's Demands 
• SRTY, from page 1 
ence with John Muir CoUege alum-
nus Steve York and his pornography, 
which dates back to last spring, made 
the decision, Ratcliff said. FoUowing a 
pornographic airing by York in mid-
October, the council passed a bill that 
implemented a ban on graphic nUdity 
on Oct. 26. 

Despite Te~' accusations, the uni-
versity had no part in the matter, 
Ratcliff said. 

"Wben Steve York aired his first 
porno of the year, I think that it opened 
the council's eyes," he said. "York actu-
ally gave the council reason to pass the 
ban by airing his material." 

While Ratcliff links York to SRTV's 
eventual iI1s, indumDg a shutdown by 
the A.S. Council on Nov . • , adminis-
trators were plotting against the sta-
tion even before the A.S. Council shut 
it down, Tess said. 

Tess referred to e-maiJs written by 
Ratcliff to Vice ChanceUor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson, which men-
tioned different scenarios fur the sta-
tion. 

In the Oct. 6 e-mail, Ratcliff sug-
gested first creating a program review 
board for the station that "reviews 
program proposals to make sure they 
comply with their current ruJes and 
regulations." He also considered giving 
the university control of the station if 
the initial plan failed, jwtified because 
the administration "can say we gave 

students a chance to work [itl out." 
The e-mails were taken out of con-

text and were just contingencies that 
are made in any organization, Ratcliff 
said. 

However, those contingencies were 
more like schemes, according to Tess, 
and are completely opposite to his 
own goals. For instance, the addition 
of a program review board is out of the 
question, said Tess, who believes the 

ersity resource 
that will not be used 
for pornographY-'

process would be "prior review" and 
illegal under state law_ 

In addition, Ratcliff', requirement 
to ban all instances of "graphical 
depictions of sexual nudity" is too 
expansive, Tess said_ 

"It's just there to ease people's 
minds, but will have no meaning." he 
said. "The statement is so broad that 
it will do nothing.-

The loopholes in Ratcliff's required 
provision were highlighted in e-mails 

in which administrators questioned 
the legality of York's pornographic 
broadcasts, according to Tess. 

"Even if they covered the organs, 
wouldn't the video still violate the 
charter if they had sex during the 
program?" A.S. Adviser Lauren 
Weiner stated in a Oct. 28 e-mail to 
Ratcliff. 

But the prospect of excluding the 
nUdity provision, and allowing more 
York-like broadcasts, is too dan-
gerous to consider, Ratcliff said. In 
the end, the university owns Triton 
Cable, which broadcasts the SRTV 
signal, 50 it may do with the station 
as it pleases. 

"Triton Cable is a university 
resource that will not be used for 
pornography," Ratcliff said. "It's as 
simple as that." 

Tess matches Ratcliff's unyielding 
approach with one of his own. 

"The administration is not the 
invincible block that everyone makes 
[it) out to be," he said. kWhere do we 
go from here? I don't know, but there 
are certain things that SRTV isn't 
willing to give up either, and admin-
istrators need to take those to heart." 

Although he is concentrating on 
reworking the station charter, Tess 
said he is actively seeking legal coun-
sel as his own contingency plan.

Fees Should Take Priority, Sweeten Says 
• FOX, from page 1 

on research. After taking the agreed 
amount of time off and receiving- the 
sabbatical stipend, a professor must 
then return to the university to con-
tinue teaching. 

Asked whether his decision to 
award Fox a sabbatical defied the 
principle behind them, Dynes told 
the Union -Tribune, "That was Mary 
Anne's judgment:' 

Although Fox had earned sab-
batical leave at her previous job, 
she would have had to forfeit it by 
accepting the position of chancellor at 
UCSD, according to Dynes, because 
she would not be returning to her 
position at North Carolina State. 

Fox did not respond to an e-mail 
and did not return calls requesting an 
interview. 

However,Associate Vice Chancellor 
of University Communications Stacie 
Spector directed all questions regard-
ing Fox's sabbatical payment to the 
UC Office of the President. 

Media coverage of the university's 
compensation and transparency have 
been circulating since November, 
prompting state Sen. Jeff Denham 
(R-Merced) to introduce legislation 
th reatening to strip the U C system 
of its constitutionally protected inde-
pendence if it fails to change its cur-
rent compensation practices. The 
state Legislature has also called for 
a ~parate, independent audit of the 
university's pay policies. 
. In the past year, there was a so-

percent increase in the number of 
employees earning more than 

5300,000 annually, while mandatory 
UC student fees have jumped nearly 
80 percent over the last four years. 

"The secret and outrageous salary 
and benefit scam for UC executives 
must end," Denham stated in a press 
release. "Students face fee increas-
es every year and UC rank-and-file 
workers face salary freezes, but UC 
top administrators keep getting secret 
salary hikes and benefits. We need to 

It': obscene that the 
chancellor should be 
paid so much when 

studentsstnu~e 
to get by?' 

- Maria Figueroa, Member, 
Coalition of University Employees 

send a message that this will no longer 
be tolerated." 

A.S. President Christopher 
Sweeten said that, although he under-
stands that the university needs to 
recruit the best possible candidates, he 
does not like the idea that student fees 
are elevated even as employee salaries 
balloon. 

'" feel that when the University of 
California claims that we are going to 
have to make cutbacks and increase 
the fees on students that the UC sys-
tem should re-examine (its) policy 

and not place the burden on the backs 
of students," Sweeten stated in an e-
mail. 

UCSD employees, on the other 
hand, have mixed feelings about their 
chancellor's sabbatical stipend. 

The compensation packages are 
large and unfair to university work-
ers, according to Maria Figueroa, the 
UCSD representative of the Coalition 
of University Employees. 

"There are clerical employees 
who work one or two extra jobs to 
make ends meet," Figueroa stated in 
an e-mail . "Health care premiums 
and parking rates have increased. It's 
obscene that the chancellor should be 
paid so much when students and staff 
struggle to get by." 

But Jean -Bernard Minster, a geo-
physics professor at Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography and the chairman 
of UCSD's Academic Senate, said 
that, although he feels that the public 
hould have ·been made aware of the -

payment, he is not offended by Fox's 
salary. 

"She earned that sabbatical," 
Minster said. "She deserves to be com-
pensated, and she has gained the trust 
and respect of the majority of people 
I talk to." 

Results from the fLrst phase of the 
university-led audit should be avail· 
able by the end of January, and the 
audit should be finished within six 
months, according to Regent Judith 
Hopkinson .

tioned the university's fiscal responSi-
bility, with Regent Judith Hopkinson

ity list since her arrival.

Aated A 

y now, nothing 
Steven Soderbergh 
does should come as 
too much of a shock-
er. Ifhe were a musi-
cian, he ' would be 
showered in praise 

for his dizzying range; but as 
a film director, he's routinely 
mauled by critics for leaving 
the award-winning, star-stud-
ded terrain of "Traffic" and 
"Erin Brockovi ch" to muddle 
in weird little art-house exper-
iments like "Schizopoli ." 

" Bubble" fall s squarely 
into the second category, but 
this time it's 3n experiment 
in more ways than one. This 
low-budget film is the unlikely 
guinea pig for an innovation 
that has the industry up in 
arms: simu ltaneous release. 
Forgoing the habitu al "release 
window" formula - whereby a 
film goes first to theaters, then 
DVD, then television, spread 
out as ' much as possible to 
maximize profits - "Bubble" 
will be the first film to ever 
(willingly) be released to all 
three platforms at once. While 

some are already sobbing over 
the death of the movie theater, 
Soderbergh has defended him -
self by pointing out that this is 
already how movies come out, 
thanks to piracy. 

But will the little "Bubble" 
burst industry conventions? 
At just over 70 minutes, this 
slow-paced yet deftly realistic 
tale of murder in a small-town 
toy factory feels more like a 
long short than a short fea -
ture. It's not a film likely to 
have anyone rushing to see it 
in the theater, save art-house 
jll nkies, but whether you see 
it in a faded red velvet eat or 
on your couch, you're in the 
Midwest as Soderbergh guides 
his audience on a voyeuristic 
journey to small -town Ohio. 
If it feels real, that's becau e it 
is. The actors are local nonpro-
fessionals; the costumes and 
settings are their own clothes 
and homes; and perhaps most 
effectively, they worked with 
Soderbergh on their script 
along the way, though kept in 
the dark about the plot's unrav-

The late Derek Bailey was one of the most important and influential free-jazz guitarists. However, he ventured far from jazz traditions 
- his influences are more like Cage or Cowell 
than Coleman or Coltrane. He uses tIle guitar 
more as a sound source and a percussive instru-
ment than the traditional strumming or picking 
techniques most guitar players employ. 1£ Einstein 
said "imagination is more important than knowl-
edge," then Derek Bailey may well have added, 
"Creativity is more important than technique~

shift rather than a complete departure. While Gira's 
voice comes to dominate, the Family's sporadic 
harmonies still contribute a vital, absurd comer of 
the final destination. It's a 747-size trip through the

ingenuity should overcome any obstacles. In this 
album, Bailey attempts to overcome his physical 
condition with creativity and improvisation. 

However, Carpal Tunnel is surprisingly simi-
lar to his previous works. Shards of dissonance, 
scrapes and clangs fill the atmosphere of the 
record. His efforts are certainly genuine and cre-
ative, but the end result is not as coherent as his 
other albums. While a sympathetic listener may 
go easy on Bailey, the cold-hearted critic cannot. 
Still, it is a worthy listen and an inspiration for 
creativity. Perhaps Bailey's last influence will be to 
remind us the potential of our own innovation.

.... 

the lack of distinction and uniquene fails to 
stand out from the rest of the offerings within the 
genre. But the album's weakness is al 0 it trength: 
Because it follows the same template that similar 
groups employ, it's fairly easy to dive right into. It's 
a harmless, safe album that you'll enjoy when you 
hear it, but immediately forget about the moment 
you stop. It's predictable, done medium well.

Behind the Camera Lens of a Former Rock Star 
By Ann Shen 

SEN IOR STAFF WRITER 

Stepping into the sparse, clean exhibition hall of the an Diego Museum of Photographic Arts 
fee ls like falling into the pages of an 
artist 's journal. You wander through 
white pace and pause to lean for-
ward and squint at a small , framed 
window into another time, another 
place, another life. 

This life currently belongs to 
Graham Nash, the 63-year-old 
singer/songwriter of Crosby, Stills 
& Nash fame and collector of an 
ensemble of black-and-white pho-
tographs from his personal life 
titled "Eye to Eye: Photographs by 
Graham Nash:' 

The exhibit opened Friday, Jan. 
13, in a reception buzzing with 
MOPA's loyal members and local 
press. The silver-haired photogra-
phy and digital -printing pioneer 
carried the poise of a pedagogue 
and the confident smile of a world -
weary rock star amid a swarm of 
photographers, Chanel -scented 
socialites and society-page writ-
ers. "Eye to Eye" made a subtle yet 
intense debut : A myriad of black-
and-white digital prints document a 
good five decades of Nash's incred-
ible yet simple life. 

Nash is famou s for being a key 
member of the Hollies in the 1960s, 
one of the UK's most successful pop 
groups, and then leaving the group 
at the height of their fame to form 
Crosby, Stills & Nash with friends 
David Crosby and Stephen Stills. 

With Crosby, Stills & Nash, he 
achieved even greater worldwide 
success, and started collecting pho-
tographs in the 1970s. In the 1990s, 
Nash sold his collection to co-found 
Nash Editions, a digi tal fine-arts 
lithographic firm that uses some 
of the most advanced digital pho-
tographic and printing equipment 
avai lable. 

The exhibit features portraits, 
even snapshots, of people doing 
everyday things in their everyday 
lives - except these people are David 

Still life: Crosby, Stills & Nash member Graham Nash's photographs of tour friends (Joni 
Mitchell, top left; David Crosby, bottom left) and strangers are showcased at the Museum of 
Photographics Arts in Balboa Parle through April 30. 

Crosby (affectionately referred to as 
"Croz" in all of Nash's commen-
taries), Joni Mitchell, Twiggy, Jerry 
Garcia and Neil Young, to name 
a few. These intimate peeks into 
the musician's life are surprisingly 
mundane, with the proverbial hotel 
room playing a large role in stag-
ing. Mitchell look on forlornly in 
a dark studio; Garcia spaces out on 

stage; Crosby sits on a park bench. 
Each photograph offers a moment 
of extraordinary humanness inside 
legendary lives. 

More interesting are the descrip-
tions accompanying each piece, 
where Nash si tuates the photograph 
in ti me and place. These descrip-
tions are like scribbles in a journal. 
carrying a certain level of entimen-

tality and banality in them, such 
as: "Self-portrait taken just after 
watching the World Trade Center 
collapse. I was awakened by friend 
Barry Oilman in the Teatro Hotel, 
Denver, CO 2001" and "My girl-
friend Calli Cerami helped me to 
make this self-portrait taken at the 
Plaza Hotel, NYC, at the end of the 
firs t CSNY tadium tOllr, 1974." 

The visitors were equally as 
enthralled with his quips as they 
were with his photographs, both 
forming a sec ret keyhole where 
the viewer can peek into life inside 
celebrity. 

"Eye to Eye" runs through April 30 
at the Museum of Photographic Arts in 
Balboa Park.

THURSDAY, JANUARY 26, 2006 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

A Cast of Charming Nonactors Give 
'Bubble' a Voyeuristic Intimacy 
~ BUBBLE, (rom page 8 
eling_ 

Martha (played by Debbie Doebereiner, 
discovered at a KFC drive -thru) is a lonely, 
plump middle-aged woman with pleasant, 
unfocused blue eyes creepily similar to those 
of the dolls she makes at the local toy factory. 
Kyle (the elegant Dustin James Ashley, a com-
puter technology student in real life) is her 
shy, anxiety attack-suffering co-worker and 
professed "best friend" - though he himself 
does not return the compliment, barely mum-
bling his half-sentences as she drives him to 
the factory and to his second job. 

Martha is painfully touching in her small 
dreams and her small talk. It's hard not to 
wince as she snaps a picture of Kyle at a dingy 
breakfast diner because she wants a picture 
of her best friend, then carries on about how 
she's "ready for the beaches" (having seen 
Aruba on TV). Kyle is just as lonely, explain-
ing to Martha in ~heir excruciatingly realistic 
break-room talk that he has no time between 
his jobs to find a girlfriend. Soderbergh, who 
shot the movie himself in brisk high-def using 
a pseudonym, captures this low-key despair 
by filming long still segments. In one scene, 
he has Kyle sitting in his room in his mother's 
house, turned away, smoking a slow cigarette, 
barely moving. Barely breathing. Plenty of Gus 
Van Sant moments here. but with a bit more 
plot than a Gus Van Sant movie (which. let's 
be honest, isn't too difficult of an accomplish -
ment) . 

This strange symbiotic relationship is soon 
shaken up by the arrival of a new factory 
worker. Rose (Misty Dawn Wilkins, a salon 
stylist) is a . young, attractive single mother 
(her toddler is played by the actress' own 
child) who is bored to death with her si tua· 
tion_ She talks on and on enough for the rest 
of them, and while she and Kyle start taking 
cigarette breaks together, Martha starts grow-
ing concerned over Rose's character. Pretty 
soon, Rose is found dead. 

Whodunnit? 
The rest of the plot is as painfully obvious 

to the audience as it is morbidly mesmerizing. 

While many independent films tread a fi ne 
line between trying to justly capture small -
town life and condescending to it , anyo ne 
who's ever lived in an isolated area will rec-
ognize the dialogue in "Bubble" as completely 
organic. The result is a fascinating if stark 
exposition of a banal time and place loosely 
held together by a banal crime, yet tied up 
skillfully by a lingering camera eye and a luck-
ily casted trio. 

The only real false note: a disappointing 
soundtrack Signed by Robert Pollack of Guided 
by Voices, which sounds like he skimmed the 
press release and thought, "Murder! Toy Dolls! 
lndie! Ok, I'll make it creepy but simple. Really. 
really simple," then sat down for a couple of min-
utes, strung two chords together, and repeated 
them as jarringly as possible into infinity. 

In the end, though "Bubble" is headed 
straight for art-house theaters, it's neverthe-
less got people talking. Soderbergh has a 
contract to dish out five more low-budget, 
simultaneous-release films over the next five 
years, and if they cast as eerie of a spell as 
this first try, then "Bubble" could very well 
turn out to be more than just a little ripple in 
filmmaking. And he's just the guy to do it, if 
anyone can.

THU~Y, JANUARY 26, 2006 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS 13 

Step Behind the Scenes of the U.S. War Machine 

COURTESY Of SONY ClASSICS 
In tile IIftIIJ/ _: The sober documentll11/, "WIty We Fight,' is a far cry from Michael Moore's antics, delving into the military-industrial compla ta attempt /0 understand the various reasons that the United States engages in war abroad. 

By Adam Kr:lmum 
STAFF WRITER 

Is there a reason why We go to war? It seems that by just turning on Fox News orCNN. you can get answers 
scrolling across your screen. 1be words 
are always simple and straight to the 
point: "Liberation of Iraq" or "Fighting 
Terror Around the World.· The ide-
als these words represent appear so 
quaint and appealing - but how can 
one fight for something so intangible 
as "liberty;" or be against something as 
equivocal as "terror?" 

There are many answers, and 
more questions in the urgently prob-
ing documentary "Why We Fight." 
Director Eugene Jarecki, an astute sto-
ryteller, is interested in the mechanics 
of war - essentially who or what is 
pulling the strings behind the car-
nage, and why they are doing it. 

The director pulls interviews from 

an array of sources: ex-government 
officials. relatives of Sept. 11 victims, 
members of the u.s. Air Force and 
journalists. By constructing a well-
researched web of facts and testimo-
nials, the events surrounding Sept. 11 
and the lraq war become dearer. One 
interview in particular with an ex-
Pentagon employee is truly startling. 
She recounts the time before the Iraq 
war - that it was never a question of 
"if" we would go into Iraq, but rather 
how the government would prepare 
the public for such an invasion. This 
type of reporting was necessary but 
sorely missing at that critical time; 
Jarecki knows it. and does his best to 
fill in the holes. 

"Why We Fight'" is largely framed 
around one crucial line President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower gave at his 
farewell address in 1961. an ominous 
warning of what lay ahead for the 
United States: "In the councils of 

government. we mllst guard against 
the acquisition of unwarranted influ-
ence. whether sought or unsought, 
by the military-ind~strial complex. 
The potential for the disastrous rise 
of misplaced power exists and will 
persist." In modem times, the desires 
of the "military-industrial complex" 
have become hardly distinguishable 
from the goals of the military. which 
Eisenhower recognized as a system 
that hinges on the expansion of mili-
tary conflict throughout the world. 

Jarecki is horrified by this busi-
ness; he shows factories that manu-
facture bombs and industry conven-
tions devoted to weapons and mili-
tary technology. A poignant moment 
has a factory worker saying that she 
would rather be making toys than 
bombs - but this happens to be the 
principal source of employment in 
her town. How can one fauJt her for 
just trying to get by? 

The conservative blowhards may 
argue that Jarecki is a propagandist, 
a nut of the left-wing variety, but 
they would be missing the point of 
the ftlm. The filmmaker is interest-
ed in the logic of war and publiciz-
ing his findings, not simply assailing 
the Bush administration. It can even 
be said Jarecki is the anti-Michael 
Moore. Though they both share the 
same aims - stopping the Iraq war 
and revealing all the behind-the-
scenes manipulations of the Bush 
administration - they differ drasti-
cally in the delivery and execution 
of those goals. While Jarecki clearly 
highlights the discussion between 
the two conflicting sides. Moore 
would rather hammer the other side 
into the ground using theatrics to 
politicize. 

It is disheartening to realize that 
companies gain from the devasta-
tion of human life; war is not only

an instrument of foreign policy. but 
almost more importantly. a bUsi-
ness transaction. But the higher-ups 
are not the only culprits, as Jarecki 
points out; all Americans have silent-
1y consented to the military-indus-
trial complex. Activism is no longer 
as frequent and people have grown 
uncomfortable with raising issues 
in such morally ambiguous times as 
these. "Why We Fight" is a reminder 
that the truth must be sought out to 
create change. and only then can the 
public understand the rationale for 
war. if there is any.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSD.o\V, JANUARY 26/ 2006 

Tritons Brave Bruises to Shutout UCLA 

BILLY WONG/GUliRDlliN 
The UCSD women', rugbll team beat the Bruins twice in a row, 34-0 lind 22-7, to open its regular SftISOn. ~ team will look to mnain 
unbeaten in the Southern California Rugbll Football Union when they face Arizona State on Jan. 29 and UC Santo Barbaro on March 4. 
• RUGBY, from page 16 
and came back to the team with lots of 
experience," Smith said 

Duggan's experience is a pat asset 
to a young Triton team that will need 
plenty of guidance from Smith and the 
older players to continue their unbeat-
en streak in the SCRFU from last year 
and advance to the Division I women's 
national finals at Stanford University 
in May. 

A national title is by no means a 
long shot, as the Tritons were awarded 
the No. 4 preseason ranking and are liv-
ing up to their high expectations with 
their first two wins over the Bruins. 

Even if the Tritons miss out on a 
tide this year, the spon keeps gaining 
popularity and UCSD will remain one 

of the premiere teams in the country 
fOr yean to come. 

MWomen's rugby is the fastest 
growing collegiate sport in the United 
States," Smith said "Were starting to 
attract the athletes." 

Although UCSD attracts more than 
enough playus to form a team, there 
are questions about the physical nature 
of the sport that leave some girls afraid 
to step on the pitch. 

- It's a very rough sport," Smith 
admitted. "But if you play the right 
way. you can be safe." 

The team is filled with fearless 
women who enjoy the aches and pains 
to gain valuable life experience. 

~Rugby's addicting; you either love 
it or hate it," Smith said. "Girls become 

very confident because they've just 
matured so well and are ready for life:' 

However. to gain more national 
attention and respect, the Tritons will 
have to continue their dominance over 
the other league members: Arizona 
State University and UC Santa Barbara, 
the No. 2- and No. 3-ranked teams, 
respectively, from last year. 

The Tritons will host Arizona State 
on Jan. 29 befOre traveling north to 
face UC Santa Barbara on March 4. 
Both teams pose a significant threat 
to UCSD's unbeaten streak, but have 
fa1Ien to the Tritons in their previous 
matches. 

"This weekend is rea1Iy going to 
say if were at the same level with ASU," 
Smith said. 

Bryant's Perfonnance Rivals Chamberlain 
~ KOBE, from page 1 6 

Now, time to compare this feat to 
Chamberlain's. 

First of all, Chamberlain was a 7-
foot-I-inch center playing in an era 
where some teams scored in an excess 
of ISO points. There were only about 
three players over 6 feet, 10 inches and 
he was bigger and stronger than basi-
cally every one of his opponents. Most 
of his shots were around the basket, 
not having to go out further than 10 
feet to 20 feet away from the basket. 

I'm not taking anything away from 
his lOO-point game, but 28 of his 
points (10 more than Bryant) carne 
from his 32 free-throw attempts (12 
more than Bryant). Chamberlain's 
season average for free throws was at 
61 percent, but that night he shot 87.5 

percent. He converted on 36-63 (57.1 
percent) field goals, while Bryant shot 
28-46 (60.1 percent). Chamberlain 
made 100 of his team's 1 ~9 points (59.2 
percent), while Bryant scored 81 of the 
Lakers' 122 (66.4 percent). 

Bryant may have had the advan-
tage of the three-point-shot, but 
Chamberlain wouldn't have taken any 
threes while Bryant only benefited 7 
extra points from them. 

As a swingman, Bryant has to roam 
around fOr defense and sometimes has 
to bring the ball up the floor. He has 
to use a lot more energy to drive the 
ball and shoot long jump shots than 
Chamberlain had to spend playing in 
the low post. 

Chamberlain also owns the tbird-
highest -scoring total in a single game 

with his 78 points in a game that went 
into triple overtime. Imagine what 
Bryant cou1d have done if Dallas was 
competitive and not only played the 
fourth quarter, but 15 or more extra 
minutes. 

Chamberlain was a great player, 
no doubt about it Maybe it's the lack 
of video footage of Chamberlain's I ()() 
points. but I am more impressed with 
Bryant's 81 in 2006 than Chamberlain's 
100 in 1962. 

After watching Bryant working 
on the Raptors' small forward Morris 
Peterson, double-pumping and scor-
ing his nnd point, the Raptors play-
by-play announcer, Chuck Swirsky, 
sununed up my point in one comment: 
· You are looking at greatness tonight 
in Los Angeles."

Women Swivers T Toreros, 170-120 
By Lauren Kalo 

STAI F WRITER 

The U SD women' wimming 
and diving team trumped cross· 
town rival, the Univcr it)' of an 
Diego, on Jan . 21 with ease, win-
ning eight of the tlr,t 10 event. in 
the competition and 10 of the 16 
total events. By the end of the con· 
test at Canyon\1iew Pool, the Tritons 
accrued a strong final standing of 
170 -120 over the Toreros. 

Three-time diver of the year 
senior Jennie Margrave .wept both 
the one-meter and three-meter 
diving events to help the team. 
Freshman Jennifer Sims also did her 
part , dtlminating both the 100-yard 
and 200-yard butterfly races with 
re pective times of 59.18 seconds 
and two minutes, 7.55 seconds. 

The Triton 200 medley relay 
team of freshman Aubr.ey Panis, 
senior Louisa Salisbury, Sims and 
junior Emily Harlan kicked off 
the meet with a strong finish over 
USD. 

The group's time of 1:49.74 
left no room for the competition, 
finishing more than two seconds 
ahead of the next-place finisher. 

Last week's National Collegiate 
wimmer of the Week, senior 

Sophie Levy, blew away the com-
petition with a time of 17:19.38 in 
the 1,650 freestyle. Levy edged out 
teammate and second-place fin -
isher junior Andrea Lippin's time 
of 18:12.77. Levy also participated 
in the 500 freestyle race, but the 
Torero competition squeaked by 
her, finishing only two-tenths of a 
second faster than Levy, who ended 
up with a time of 5:06.22 in econd 
place. 

At last week's meet against 
Division' UC Davis, Levy won the 
500 freestyle as well a the 1,000 
freestyle, for which she holds the 
school record.

Freshman Shannon Simonds 
showed impressive form with a 
time of 54.59 seconds in the 100 
freestyle, with Harlan fi n ishing the 
same race in 54.73 econds. Panis 
captured the win in the 200 back-
stroke at 2: 11 .53, beating the next-
place fi nisher by more than two 
seconds. 

After placing high in several 
events this year, the Triton women 
'head into the home stretch of the 
season with a record of 3-4 and 
hope for a repeat of last season's 
success. 

A year ago the swim and dive 
teams saw many new highs. On 
the women's side, UCSD captured 
the Pacific Coast Swim Conference 
title and qualified 13 swimmers 
and two divers for the NCAA 

Last year. a combined 23 Tri ton 
swimmers and divers earned All-
American status at the NCAA 
Championships, a high mark that 
th is year's squads are looking to 
su rpass. 

The men's team had the week-
end off from competition, but both 
of head coach Scott McGihon's 
squads will return to action on Jan. 
28, against UC Irvine. The event 
will be the last home event as well 
as the fi nal meet of the regular 
season. 

The Tritons will have some rest 
before leaving for the PCSC cham-
pionships in Long Beach on Feb. 
8. After the PCSCs, the teams will 
focus on the last event of the year, 
the NCAA Championships, to be 
held this year in Indianapolis on 
March 8.

Women's Rugby Blanks~ Bruins, 34-0

Freshman outside center Julia Anderson left her ponytail ill the dust as she ran down field in UCSD's 34-0 will over UCLA on Jan . 22.

The UCLA Bruins, a perennial 
powerhouse on the basketball court 
and on the football field, bowed to 
Triton dominance on the women's 
rugby pitch on Jan. 22, as the UCSD 
squad annihilated a fo rmidable 
Bruins team, 34-0, improving on its 
22-7 victory over the same Bruins a 
week earlier. 

The two wins came in the first two 
games of the 2006 Southern California 
Rugby Football Union regular season. 
following the UCSD-hosted Serum 
by the Sea 'warmup tournament on 

ov. 12 and 13. 
After winning the Scrum last year, 

the Tritons did not fare a well this 

season, failing to win the tournament 
after they lost a group of graduating 
senior veterans and tried to incorpo-
rate the younger players into games to 
give them valuable experience. 

Although the fini h was disap-
pointing, the playing time paid off in 
full, as the younger player were pre-
pared as ' soon as the regular ea on 
kicked off against UCLA. 

I n the 34-0 clobbering. the Tritons' 
nonstop offensive onslaught forced 
the Bruins into numerous penalties, 
which led to even more cores from 
UCSD. 

Although U SD' · offensive bar-
rage made the final score look quite 
lopsided. Monica Zigler, a UCSD 
back insisted that the Bruin made 
the Tritons fight for a win. 

"I feel like. the score makes the 
game seem easier than it was:' Zigler 
said. "It was a hard-fought game:' 

Jill Duggan, an eight-man forward, 
captain and one of the team's more 
experienced players, was a major con-
tributor in the Triton ' 34-point vic-
tory, just as she was throughout last 
eason, when the Tritons outscored 

their opponents by a total of287-39. 
According to head coach Carla 

Smith, Duggan is an extremely valu-
able player becau e she put in extra 
time during the offseason, playing 
with the Pretoria Blue Bull ,a profes-
sional team in South Africa.

Guard Leads Tritons' Historic Start With On-Court Confidence

Junior guard Leora Juster has btm striking her shooting JIO" a lot this 5t05On, as she kif 
the 2006 Tritons to a 12-2 overall record and a No. 25 ranking in the national polls. 

Junior Leora Juster's 
24.8 ppg during eight-
game streak helps 
team post best start in

By icilY Buchanan 
STAFF WRITER 

There are many reasons why the 
UCSD women' basketball team is 
off to a school record -setting 12-2 
overall start and is tied atop the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association standings with a 7-1 
league record. A new coach, better 
shooters and increased fan support 
are all possibilities, but junior guard 
Leora Juster is most likely respon-
sible for much of the No. 25 Tritons' 
success both on and off the court 
this season. 

Juster has averaged 24.8 points 
per game during the Tritons' current 
eight-game winning streak, which 

to high school. where she averaged 
21 points per game and was named 
the Most Valuable Player for the 
Venice Gondoliers in Los Angeles. 

Following her high school career, 
she started playing basketball at 
UCSD, which she says was her "fi rst 
and only choice:' 

She set a great precedent for her-
self as a player in her freshman year, 
when she competed in all 28 games 
as a rookie, starting in 27 of those 
contests and finished the season off 
by capturing the team's best offensive 
player award. 

As she moved on into her sopho-
more year, she was a second-team 
All-CCAA selection and led the 
team in scoring with 14.7 points per 
game, with double digits in 24 of the 
team's 27 games, while making 80 
percent of her free throws. 

Now a junior, Juster's consistency 
and skill level has only increased, 
though the very humble, nearly 6-
foot-tall player will not admit it. 

"' can't say I'm pleased with my 
skill level," Juster said. has given them their first 

ever national ranking 
at the Division II level. 
Besides her . contribu-

PROFILE "I'm definitely confident in some skills, but I have 
tions to the scoreboard, Juster is also 
a huge part of a close-knit Triton 
squad, whose chemistry is leading 
to wins. 

"Basketball [is) a great outlet to 
express yourself and feel like part of 
a family," JlISter said. 

Family is what got Juster into bas-
ketball in the first place, as her fam-
ily had her playing on the hardwood 
at t~e tender age of five. The early 
practices paid off by the time she got 

tons of improvement left 
to do. Awards and recognitions real-
ly. haven't meant anything to me; the 
respect I get from teammates and 
coaches is all the recognition I could 
ever ask for." 

Although individual awards 
might be meaningless to Juster, 
an NCAA D-II championship title 
could have some meaning. Though 
they are a long way off, the Tritons 
have the No. 1 seed in their region 
as ofthis point and will look to con-

tinue their successful style of play 
against the tougher competition in 
the NCAA tournament. 

To win the school's first ever D-II 
national championship in basketball. 
Juster and the rest of the Tritons 
will have to keep their energy levels 
high. The average college student can 
imagine how tiring a week of school 
i for athletes with homework, club 
and sport's commitments, as well as 
trying to squeeze in some social time. 
However, while most rely on coffee 
and Monster drinks, Juster relies on 
her coaches and teammates to fuel 
her fire. 

"Energy is hard to keep high; 
sometimes you have to have artificial 
energy, but real energy is something 
you get from teammates and coach-
es," Juster said. 

Apparently rap music, which she 
says "pumps me up and makes me 
walk with a swagger," deserves a bit of 
motivational credit as well. 

It seems as if the entire team is 
walking with a well-deserved swagger 
since it has knocked off eight-straight 
teams. However, the team's streak and 
Juster's skills have not come easily. 

"I've really tried working hard at 
everything I could," Juster said. "But 
I think one of the biggest hurdles for 
me personally was, and still is, gain-
ing as much unnatural athleticism 
and mental strength as possible." 

Juster is realizing the danger of 
questioning her shot selection. 

'" know that if , score an ade-
quate amount of points, the team is 
more likely to win; Juster said. ·So ,
