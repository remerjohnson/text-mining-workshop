FINALLY, SOMETHING TO SHOUT ABOUT ▶ OPINION, PAGE 4

By Connie Shieh
Senior Staff Writer 

A funding provision for new 
campus nightclub the Loft will not 
be included on next quarter’s activ-
ity-fee referendum, the A.S. Council 
decided last week in a 15-11 vote 
that struck down the proposal.

University Events Office Director 
Martin Wollesen first introduced the 
measure to the council on Oct. 15. 
According to the budget he provid-
ed, the proposed $2.65 quarterly stu-
dent fee would have enabled the Loft 
to continue offering the ambitious 
programming it has demonstrated 
since its opening on Sept. 25.

Over the past month, the A.S. 
Council forum has been a referen-
dum battleground, divided by those 
who support and those who oppose 
the Loft’s funding request.

Sixth College Senator Vishal 
Kotcherlakota said many council-
members appreciate the Loft’s fre-
quent events and intimate space, 
but that the majority of them feel 
the university should demonstrate 
greater financial responsibility for 
the enterprise that it developed.

“There are other services on 
campus that could use that same 
$2.65 and do a lot more with it,” 
Kotcherlakota said. “Building some-
thing that [the administration] could 
not support themselves is what upset 
a lot of councilmembers.”

Some councilmembers were also 
upset that the referendum would not 
give the council control over use of 
the Loft’s profits, despite the fact that 
the nightclub’s funding would be 
generated in part by student activ-
ity fees.

At its Nov. 5 meeting, the council 
witnessed the largest public-com-
ment turnout of the year. Among 
participants was former council-
member Kyle Samia, who defended

Hundreds Rally Against Gay Marriage Ban

By Reza Farazmand
News Editor 

California’s constitutional amend-
ment to define marriage as between 
a man and a woman continued to 
draw vocal protest last week when a 
coalition of nearly 400 students, fac-
ulty, staff and community members 
converged on campus to take part 
in a walk-out rally denouncing the 
controversial new legislation. 

Beginning shortly before noon 
with an open microphone at Price 
Center Plaza, the rally saw protes-
tors march through campus and out 
onto La Jolla Village Drive, where 
chants of “equality” and “civil rights” 
drew frenzied honking from passing 
motorists, as police officers stood by.

“We are the youth,” Thurgood 
Marshall College senior and rally 
organizer Rob Corea said before a 
cheering crowd gathered outside 
Geisel Library near the close of the 
protest. “We are the future. We are 
going to be the ones who are going 
to bring equality to everyone. Gay, 
straight, black or white, civil rights 
are for everyone.”

Marshall senior and rally orga-
nizer Kyle Samia said the event was 
meant to serve as a vehicle for contin-
ued opposition to the recent passage 
of Proposition 8, the measure that 
outlaws same-sex couples from join-
ing in matrimony.

“This event was assembled by 
UCSD community members for the 
UCSD community,” Samia said. “This 
action wasn’t meant to convince any-
one from the 51 percent that voted Top left: Rally organizer Kyle Samia leads the march through campus. Top right: Demonstrators first gathered at Price Center Plaza, where individuals

Negotiations Commence Over Librarian Salaries

By Deepak Seeni
Staff Writer

The American Federation of 
Teachers, on behalf of University of 
California librarians, began talks Nov. 
5 over librarian salaries and the avail-
ability of professional development 
funds. Negotiators aim to raise librar-
ian salaries to a level comparable to 
those at the California State University 
and California community college sys-
tems.

The negotiations will also address 
economic concerns that have risen 
over the past several years, including 
childcare support and tuition waiv-

ers for librarians. The talks follow 
negotiations held last spring between 
UC-AFT negotiators and university 
administrators regarding all noneco-
nomic concerns raised by UC librar-
ians and UC-AFT.

UC-AFT field representative Maria 
Tillman said negotiations will also 
focus on obtaining funding for profes-
sional development efforts that aim to 
keep UC librarians and their staffs up 
to date on contemporary information 
technology geared toward academic 
research.

“University-level research requires 
far more than Google and Wikipedia, 
and this university’s information 
search and retrieval systems are 
growing increasingly sophisticated,” 
Tillman said. “Librarians, especially at 
UC, must have the resources to master 
more skills than ever to aid students, 
faculty and other researchers in navi-
gating these systems.”

According to pamphlets released 

by UC-AFT, UC librarians earn an 
annual average of $10,000 less than 
their colleagues at both the CSU and 
community college systems through 
beginning, intermediate and senior 
positions. 

“Salaries have a major impact on 
the kind of librarians we can recruit 
and retain,” said Fred Lonidier, presi-
dent of UC-AFT Local 2034, the union 
for non-Academic Senate faculty and 
librarians at UCSD. “If we continue 
to rely on ... less experienced pro-
fessionals we are going to inevitably 
face reduced research and information 
services.”

Additionally, UC-AFT has 
expressed alarm over the UC cam-
puses losing several places in the 
annual Association of Research rank-
ings. Negotiators attribute this drop to 
unsatisfactory recruitment and reten-
tion rates for UC librarians. 

According to UC-AFT, these reten-
tion problems are a result of  uncom-

petitive salary rates when compared to 
those offered by private sector librar-
ies, California public libraries, CSU 
campuses and community college 
libraries. 

“We are having trouble filing posi-
tions because librarians know [the UC 
system] is no longer paying as well 
as [the CSU system] or many com-
munity colleges,” Tillman said. “If the 
UC continues to provide lower salaries 
than those offered at competing insti-
tutions, I think we will see an eventual 
demise in the educational quality and 
research capabilities of the university.”

UC-AFT negotiators and uni-
versity administrators have not yet 
established any agreements over salary 
renegotiations. The two groups plan 
to meet again Nov. 19 to continue 
negotiations and address the concerns 
expressed by UC-AFT.

dseeni@ucsd.edu.

Union members cite poor 
recruitment, retention rates 
in bid to achieve wages 
comparable to other state 
public universities.

‘yes’ and it’s not meant to change 
minds. It’s for the UCSD commu-
nity to address our grievances and to 
express those grievances as a com-
munity.”

Samia said he hopes Californians 
who opposed the measure will recog-
nize the need to push for its repeal.

“California has a very deep pro-
gressive history when it comes to 
fighting discrimination and to really 
bringing about equality under the 
law,” Samia said. “Proposition 8 isn’t 
equality and it isn’t equal under the 
law, so it’s important that we remain 
visible and that we do not become 
complacent.”

Armed with signs proclaiming 
disapproval of the measure’s suc-
cess, protestors made their way to 
the Chancellor’s Complex, where  
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox emerged 
to address the crowd.

Fox voiced her personal support 
of the demonstration, but declined 
to meet demands by rally organizers 
to officially endorse the repeal move-
ment. Instead, Fox said the universi-
ty’s stance on the issue must be deter-
mined by the Board of Regents. 

According to Corea, one of the 
demonstration’s primary intentions 
was to obtain Fox’s endorsement.

“One of our goals today was really 
to speak to the campus administra-
tors and let them know that we’ll no 
longer let the university take a neutral 
stance on the Proposition 8 issue,” 
Corea said. “We feel it’s their obliga-
tion to come out and publicly speak 
out against the proposition, because 
this is a civil-rights issue and the 
California Constitution is something 
that we need to take seriously.”

Corea said the next step for the 
movement will be to demand an 
endorsement from the regents. UC 
spokesman Trey Davis, however, said 
the board has no intention of endors-
ing the movement, as the university 
only takes official positions on mea-
sures related to higher education.

Associated Students President 
Donna Bean, who marched with 
the protestors, said the A.S. Council 
will vote on a resolution to repeal 
Proposition 8 at its meeting 
Wednesday.

the Loft and urged the council to 
demand that certain stipulations be 
met to satisfy the issue of student 
control.

“This is our opportunity for bar-
gaining,” Samia said. “We don’t get 
many opportunities to bargain. The 
A.S. Council needs to step up and be 
a part of this exchange.”

A.S. President Donna Bean 
subsequently created the Special 
Committee on the Loft to discuss 
and revise the language of the provi-
sion that Wollesen had drafted for 
the council.

After a week of heavy editing 
and collaboration with Wollesen, the 
SCOTL brought forward a new pro-
posal last week that guaranteed the 
council a percentage of generated 
profits and enabled the council to 
suspend the allocation of A.S. funds 
if it decided that the money was 
being misused.

Despite these revisions, the mea-
sure was defeated by a four-vote 
margin, with no abstentions.

Without A.S. funding, Wollesen 
said the Loft will be forced to reex-
amine its plans for Winter Quarter, 
possibly offering fewer events free 
to students. He said he plans to 
continue working with the council 
to develop a Spring Quarter refer-
endum.

“Even though there were some 
people who weren’t ready to put it 
on this [A.S.] referendum, they are 
all generally very supportive of the 
Loft,” Wollesen said. “We want to 
continue to work with A.S. to get the 
right format for spring.”

November 13, 2008 marked my 20th birthday. I’m a little horrified that the time has come for me to enter a third 
decade of life. Already? I haven’t gotten any tat-
toos or done cocaine, and my youth has reached 
its end? If you spot someone vigorously spray-
painting the campus with graffiti in a belly-bar-
ing shirt, that’s me living out my final hours of 
teenage glory. 

As my dad adequately put it in my birthday e-
mail: “Time sure do flys, daughter.” (Cue Chinese 
classical music.) And how it has. Yet in 20 years, 
I’ve definitely learned my share of life lessons 
— some practical, some not — which I will 

generously impart to you now. If I could give my 
newborn self a laundry list of advice, this would 
be it, condensed into my 900-word column limit. 
Without further ado:

Barbies and Transformers can coexist on 
the same rug. You do not need to battle over 
ownership of living room turf. When the boys 
start scalping your Barbies, however, it’s time to 
declare war. 

Do not run headfirst into a cabinet door. 
Stitches hurt, and one eye will be noticeably 
smaller than the other for the rest of your life. 
People will claim otherwise, but they’re just try-
ing to be nice. 

When it says, “scratch one only,” you should 
not satiate your burning curiosity by scratching 
out both. The McDonald’s Monopoly policy will 
not allow for you to win both prizes or to choose 
which one you’d prefer. 

Should you have the bright idea to run away 
from home, go farther down the block. Your 
mom can still see you from the kitchen window 
when you’re two houses down. She will not feel 
guiltier about inflicting trauma on her child if 
you try to cry at higher decibels. Just shut up. The 
neighbors are looking at you funny. 

When you put your first-ever cell phone in 
your P.E. locker, you need to actually lock it. 
Dropping your second phone on the ground to 
demonstrate its durability is only entertaining 
until the phone ceases to be durable. Also, if you 
haven’t seen your phone for over seven days, 
don’t assume it’ll turn up sometime or other. 
Consider buying a large, brightly colored lanyard 
from which your phone should hang around 
your neck. Permanently.

Ah, never mind. Just get phone insurance to 
begin with.

The food pyramid is wrong. In 10 years, 
nobody will be encouraging you to eat 5-8 serv-
ings of bread, rice or pasta a day, and there’ll be 
this new-fangled rule about eating whole-wheat 
carbs only. However, there’s no use in obsessing 
over your body weight. After all, if you think 
you’re fat now, just wait until next year! It doesn’t 
get better. 

Detentions do not stay on your permanent 
record. Your GPA, class rank and SAT scores are 
worthless in the real world. Go to bed; save the 
under-eye bag development for when you have 
an actual career. 

Try everything once. Except hard drugs. 
You can lose your shoes in Mexico, but for 

the love of God, do your best to keep your 
dignity. And if you must be a recurring loser-of-
shoes, at least buy some Old Navy flip-flops so 
you’re not constantly depleting your footwear 
collection. 

“But everyone else is” is the worst rationale 
for anything, ever. Everyone else will also date 
questionable guys and drive drunk. Be smarter. 

Buy an ergonomic keyboard. Your wrists 
will thank you profusely. Contrary to what your 
mother is screaming from her bedroom at three 
in the morning, the Internet is not a waste of

Dear Editor,
I am writing in response to the recent story in 

the Guardian and to the recent town-hall meet-
ing on the policy changes to UCSD Affiliated 
Housing. 

First, I would like to thank Dean of Graduate 
Studies Kim Barrett and Director of Housing and 
Dining Mark Cunningham for taking the time 
to meet with students to attempt to address their 
concerns. I would also like to thank Graduate 
Student Association President Nick Saenz for 
moderating what promised to be a contentious 
meeting. I think that the meeting brought to 
light many of the concerns of not only current 
— but also future UCSD students — both in and 
out of grad housing.

I also think that the attendance and state-
ments made by hundreds of students both resid-
ing on and off campus — as well as those 
with families, and those from widely varying 
departments such as engineering, social science, 
chemistry, literature, linguistics, etc. — pro-
vide clear evidence that, by and large, graduate 
students think these changes are a bad idea. It 
became clear at the meeting that the changes 
are the result of an ill-advised interpretation of 

student surveys without actual student input. 
It also became apparent that while some agree 
with the goals, the time frame of the transitional 
policy is universally seen as unfair and raises the 
question: What’s the rush? Does this have to be 
achieved in five years? Is UCSD going to drop 
off the planet in 2012? A more gradual transition 
would seem to have the best interests of both 
current students and the university addressed.

One comment that has stuck with me, how-
ever, is the likening of these changes to an 
experiment by Barrett. I do not think many 
grad students fancy being the administration’s 
lab rat in a community-building field study. 
Further, I found Barrett’s assertion that neither 
her office nor graduate students have evidence 
either way on whether the proposed changes will 
build community to be greatly flawed. The shift 
in policy, by administrators’ own admission, 
will create a dorm-like environment. I think 
evidence for the community-building merits of 
such an endeavor is available and speaks to the 
contrary quite loudly. 

Currently, the waitlist for One Miramar, a 
dorm-like graduate housing complex, is only 
about six months, compared to the two-and-a-
half to three-year waitlist for the apartment-style 
housing at Mesa and Coast. This disparity is 
evidenced by the presence of first-year gradu-
ate students with their own apartments in One 

Miramar. I highly doubt they had the fore-
thought to join the waitlist a year before One 
Miramar was completed and fully two years 
before they began their studies here. I think 
the lack of graduate student interest in One 
Miramar as a housing option is a bullhorn to 
administrators clearly indicating exactly how 
much grad students desire to live in that type of 
“community.” It seems the university’s response 
is, rather than fixing a housing project that is 
widely unpopular, to lower the expectations of 
students by bringing all housing down to that 
level. This embrace of mediocrity is definitely 
not something becoming of a university that 
prides itself on excellence.

STUDENT LIFE — UCSD’s infamous apathy 
is not only proofed by the tumbleweeds that 
replace Triton-sculpture admirers; more disap-
pointingly, we have long felt a widening void 
in the rebellious collegiate spirit that once 
characterized our campus. Loud and physical 
political statement has died to a breeze — either 
for disinterest in current events or, perhaps, the 
sentiment that we can’t be heard in the country’s 
legislative offices from way down here in the 
trenches — though theoretically, a spotlit posi-
tion on such a renowned campus could easily 
push us up toward the front lines. 

Reminiscent nostalgia for the first major 
protests in the 1960s is a key weight to this 
downward spiral, putting a pessimistic drag on 
the pursuit of modern ways to air our grumbles. 
Instead of utilizing the infinite spider web of 
communication lines now available to us, we 
often slump into longing for the days when — in 
a fresh defiance of the university’s special mob-
proof structural design — UCSD served as a 
stage for the angry baby-boomer youth to tackle 
national injustices. Student-made documentary 
“Herbert’s Hippopotamus” (available in Geisel 
for some informative, good-times procrastina-
tion) remembers a day when socialist activists 
roamed the campus, holding registrar’s-office 
sit-ins and listening to the occasional battle cry 
from resident celebrity Angela Davis. Most dev-
astatingly — and, by consequence, awesomely 
— a UCSD student actually set himself on fire 
in opposition to the Vietnam War, making 
headlines across the country and beyond.

Half a century later, in a somewhat unregu-
lated transition period from a flame-retardant 
free-speech policy that prohibited the assembly 
of 10 or more students without prior permis-
sion, the closest we come to controversy is the 
occasional underattended Iraq war protest — 
several hundred sat in for talks at Price Center 
in 2004, and about 100 took part in a 2006 rally 
held just off campus. A beacon of light in more 
local awareness of equal rights, this year’s stu-
dent and employee protests to increase wages 
for UC workers under the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees were 
some of the largest in recent UCSD history.

As devastating as the acceptance of 
Proposition 8’s passage — defining marriage 
as strictly between a man and a woman — has 
been for such a liberal community, it appears we 
needed an especially stinging slap to get us off 
our asses once and for all. Last Friday’s march to 
repeal the amendment on grounds of being an 
illegitimate incentive — and win university offi-
cials’ endorsement of that endeavor — was the 
largest and most well-presented demonstration 
of political voice on campus in years, drawing 
an army of over 400 through every major UCSD 
walkway, equipped with banners, armbands and 
communal calls for justice.

Though the “No on Proposition 8” cam-
paign was strong and heavily manned, it just 
wasn’t enough; we all just assumed nothing 
so blatantly infringing on equal human rights 
could possibly get past the popular vote of our 
beloved bright-blue California. As the demon-
stration’s sprinkling of “No on Prop. 8” signs 
so clearly pointed out, massive opposition to 
such a backwards-thinking measure would have 

been much more effective back when it was first 
proposed, with a protest-driven case for its mis-
placement on the state constitution.

Still — there was no better way to pick up 
after the disaster. Though the romanticized 
radical approach is largely left to the video 
reserves, the protest’s call for a mature, logical 
rethinking of Proposition 8 is well served by 
its more conservative conduct. Rally organizers 
gained administrative permission beforehand 
(and for that, were met with what seemed 
to be the county’s entire police force), lined 
the sidewalks instead of the streets and pre-
pared Chancellor Marye Anne Fox with their 
demands by e-mail so that she could think hard 
on the university’s response. And though there 
is little to no chance that officials will endorse 
Proposition 8’s repeal — unsurprisingly, as the 
university is not a political entity — barking up 
the wrong tree provides the movement a much-
needed direction and reason to shout that 
much louder, heard far beyond the UC regents’ 
board room. It may not have been the balls-
out, flower-power war cry we were crossing 
our fingers for, and lord knows it would have 
done a hell of a lot more good back in May, but 
the last major infringement on constitutional 
equality has given us that last push to dust 
off the picket signs and start complain-
ing about something other than our 
own apathy.

Some of your friends will die too 
young. You will be heartbroken and 
the world will be a little emptier. But 
hearts heal, and life goes on.

Stop fully at red lights. No need 
to smile for the camera, but ducking 
won’t do you any favors. They’ve still 
got your license plate. There’s no use 
in explaining that you’re “pretty sure” 
you stopped — they take video of that 
stuff. Technology sucks. 

Floss. And wear your retainer on 
the daily. Your parents didn’t splurge 

on the only socially acceptable form of 
cosmetic enhancement to allow your 
buckteeth to re-emerge five years later. 

Reading is still the best thing you 
can do for yourself. Read everything. 
Newspapers, magazines, blogs, books. 
Read voraciously, because you can, 
and that’s a luxury not everyone can 
afford. 

This also applies to eating, but it 
doesn’t mean you should eat vora-
ciously. Nonetheless, it’s okay to eat a 
cupcake when you feel like eating a 
cupcake. (It’s not okay to eat four in 
one sitting.)

Befriend the bartender.
Your parents are your best

as they get over the initial disap-

stereotypes right and left (read: you 
suck at math), they will learn to 
embrace your abilities, as long as 
these abilities are of the musical 
variety. Let them down gently when 
you decide you are not going to be a 
professional concert pianist — that’s 
13 years of Thursday nights they will 
never get back. 

Most of all, be ridiculous. Allow 
yourself delusions of grandeur. Ideas 
mean nothing unless you make them 
reality. Love abundantly and live fear-
lessly. Don’t be cliche, but follow cli-

T he ground begins to shudder. First comes the initial wave, then the real quake. Buildings groan like a train passing. It could be the “big one” experts have been predicting for years. 
But when it comes, will we be prepared?

UCSD and other universities throughout 
California took part in the massive “Golden 
Guardian” earthquake drill last Thursday as prep-
aration for a large-scale earthquake. According to 
a report released by the U.S. Geological Survey, 
the southern San Andreas Fault has a 59 percent 
likelihood of an earthquake of magnitude 7.8 or 
higher occurring within the next 30 years. 

During the six-hour drill, members from 
UCSD’s Emergency and Continuation Services, 
campus police and a seismologist from Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography met to discuss 
emergency procedures and the likelihood of 
strong earthquake shocks on campus. In addition 
to the forum, police called on-campus depart-
ments, such as the library, to run through pos-
sible scenarios involving such a disaster.

“We’ve had an effort for continuous planning,” 
Director of Emergency and Continuity Services 
Philip Van Saun said. “It’s been a big effort of the 
chancellor to ask every department what its 
essentials are, whether it’s running water, power 
or electronics in order to teach, and we’ve been 
asking how to create back-up plans.”

Campus officials have stressed 
planning possible escape routes 
and outlining structurally 
sound areas to weather a 
potential earthquake. 
Officials also advise 
keeping copies of 
lesson plans handy 
in the case 
of a power 

outage. One aspect is a UC-wide 
Internet service, UCready, which is in its final 
stages and can provide a means of storing data 
crucial to school functions online. 

In his analysis of campus preparedness, Van 
Saun noted, of all the groups on campus, students 
may be the most at risk during an earthquake.

“In the case of earthquakes, we can’t rely on 
predictions and models, but at least we can partly 
predict humans,” Van Saun said. “It isn’t the 
police or the administration that could be better 
prepared, it’s the students. We’re all so busy that’s 
its just hard to keep safety in mind at all times. It’s 
the balance we have to maintain.”

Van Saun also said campus officials have expe-
rience with emergency response after the recent 
wildfires in Southern California, active-shooting 
drills in the wake of the shooting at Virginia Tech 
in April 2007 and a bomb scare last December.

According to research presented to the drill 
team by geophysics associate 

professor Yuri Fialko to the 
drill team, an earthquake 
hitting the southern San 

Andreas Fault 
would spread primarily in a longitudinal 
fashion parallel to the California coast, with minor 
shock waves hitting San Diego County. 

“That area of the San Andreas fault hasn’t 
had a major earthquake for about 300 years,” 
Fialko said. “It’s been storing roughly 25 milli-
meters of slip, or movement, for [that period].”

Fialko’s data, collected by satellite tracking 
of the relative speed of the San Andreas fault, 
predicts that the damage in the case of an earth-
quake would largely affect the Los Angeles area. 
USGS estimates 300,000 buildings would be 
damaged, resulting in $213 billion in repairs, 
270,000 people displaced and 1,800 deaths. 

“These are actually small numbers for an 
event of this magnitude,” Fialko said. “In per-
spective, more than 100,000 people were killed 
in China and Pakistan by recent earthquakes. 
The reason these numbers are smaller is the 
state of the buildings in California.”

Experts have concluded that the university 
is significantly prepared in terms of structurally 
sound buildings.

“All of our buildings comply with the 
California policy of science safety and if we were 

hit by an earthquake of that magnitude, we 
are hopeful there’d be minimal loss of life,” 
campus architect Boone Hellman said.

Following California building codes, 
UCSD campus buildings range from 

good to fair, Hellman said. According 
to the California Building Code, 
both meanings anticipate structural

S itting in his office cluttered with piles of old jazz records, dog-eared books, cult films and a pair of dark 
angel wings, professor Peter John pulls 
up an e-mail from a former student he 
hasn’t spoken to for 15 years.

“Is this the Peter John who used 
to teach at a little CC in an odd little 
mill town in Western Washington and 
frequent Ethiopian grunge clubs in 
Portland?” he reads. “The samba guitar 
player who swills Jagermeister and loves 
[the band] darkmotherscream?”

The self-proclaimed anarchist  
doesn’t run out of quirky pursuits. When 
John lived in Portland he built a gothic 
club in his basement. When he taught 
at the conservative Laurel Columbia 
College in Washington he was labeled 
the “antichrist” after inviting a contro-
versial guest lecturer.

Now a cornerstone of Sixth College’s 
Culture, Art and Technology writing 
program, John lives and breathes the 
spirit of rebellion. He can frequently be 
seen around campus blowing bubbles 
from a bubble sword and blasting music 
from a set of speakers mounted atop a 
bicycle he has dubbed “Frankenbike.”

“It’s just great fun,” John said. “You 
have a beer, get on the bicycle, play your 
music and just ride through the day, 
sometimes into the night, as long as the 

battery lasts. But not everyone agrees 
it’s a good thing. Some people complain 
that you’re playing music in public … 
like there aren’t other noises in public.”

Frankenbike adventures led to his 
participation in Critical Mass, a rebel-
lious bike rally held on the last Friday of 
every month. Bicyclists meet in over 300 
cities worldwide, moving in a relatively 
large pack and intentionally disobeying 
road rules to make cars aware of cyclists. 
“Bottling” occurs when bicyclists ride 
into an intersection for 10 minutes and 
stop traffic. During a Critical Mass in 
Portland, Peter John experienced first-
hand a backlash of police brutality.

“Part of it might have been the fact 
that I had my music on my bicycle, but 
it wasn’t that loud,” John said. “It was a 
gentle number by the German industri-
al group Einstürzende Neubauten ‘New 
Age Ambient Motor Music Machine,’ a 
beautiful song. But you know the cops 
don’t really have a sense of humor. 
These fuckers actually just tackled me, 
I mean literally tackled me. When there 
were about 10 of them on me, [they] 
completely … Tasered me seven times. I 
was doing nothing against the law. First 
they took me to the hospital … because 
they were convinced that I put up such 
a struggle against them, I was on some 
sort of PCP. And I said, ‘Take my blood.’ 

So they tested my blood and they were 
just so stunned and depressed that there 
was no alcohol, no drugs, nothing.”

John’s counterculture zeal extends to 
his notion of education as a liberal pur-
suit to “maximize the potential for free 
individuals.” A former biology major 
at UC Riverside and an alumnus of the 
UCSD graduate program in history, he 
believes strongly in a multidisciplinary 
approach to teaching.

“What artists are doing is the same 
thing that scientists are doing and vice 
versa,” John said. “Science is not this 
straightforward, methodical exercise. It 
is a lot of failed experiments ... it is a 
lot of imagination. There are innumer-
able examples of scientists being like 
these children at play, making things 
up. It’s a no-holds-barred struggle for 
knowledge, whether you’re in dance or 
in poetry or in physics.”

In class, he encourages a Socratic 
dialogue with up to 180 students. 
Drawing from readings, YouTube 
videos, audio clips and PowerPoint 
slides, John engages in a multi-medi-
ated discussion with students on the 
meaning of culture, art and technol-
ogy. His assigned readings encompass 
everything from classics such as Plato’s

“Republic” to radical collective works 
such as Crimethink’s “Days of War, 
Nights of Love.” In past lectures, he 
has applied cultural hegemony to the 
pop-culture film “Fight Club,” pro-
posed religious symbolism as a tech-
nological tool and suggested artistic 
qualities in Nazi propaganda.

“I don’t think it’s any surprise 
then that the program is all about 
ambiguity,” John said. “There aren’t 
a lot of certainties, and the idea that 
there are is one of the ideas we have 
to disabuse them of, and have to have 
them appreciate that the university is 
this incessant dialogue about things 
of which we have no complete knowl-
edge.”

Some students, seeking more 
tradition and less controversy, think 
otherwise. One fired-up protester on 
RateMyProfessors.com describes John 
as a “nutcase” who tries to “engrave 
evolution on everyone’s brains” and 
“disses Christianity.” Sixth College 
professor Linda Strauss told him she 
saw students praying in groups out-
side his classroom for the sanctity 
of his soul. After teaching in many 
religious schools, John maintains that 
he does not “diss Christianity,” but 
only wants to think about religion as 
a historical phenomenon.

“If you’re trying to rattle cages and 
shake people up, you’re not expecting 
them to necessarily love what you’re 
doing,” John said. “Questioning their 
orthodoxies, challenging their belief 
systems — you shouldn’t come out 
of that experience expecting to be 
loved.”

P lanning a start-up company is already a hefty task, but factor in essays that need to be written and midterms that need to be 
studied for, and the task becomes almost impos-
sible for an active student. However, this isn’t 
stopping the expected 60 to 70 teams participat-
ing in the 2008-09 UC San Diego Entrepreneur 
Challenge. 

In its third year, the student-run competi-
tion brings undergraduates, graduate students and 
postdoctoral trainees together to pit their business 
ideas against one another. Over $55,000 in prizes 
were doled out last year, and this year’s grand prize 
will be announced at the Winter Kickoff Event.

The yearlong competition is comprised of 
three separate contests: the Fall Quarter Business 
Concept Competition, the Winter Quarter 
Executive Summary Competition and the Spring 
Quarter Business Plan Presentation Competition. 
Each contest runs one quarter, with monetary 
prizes awarded to the top team.

“The contests are all independent of each other,” 
Challenge CEO and Rady MBA student Dany 
Kitishian said. “By the time you’ve gone through 
the first competition, you have received enough 
feedback so that you may improve upon the idea 
for the next two competitions. It’s important to 
compete in the first two so that you may receive 
this valuable feedback before the final competi-
tion.”

The panel of judges — all angel investors, 
business venture capitalists and legal and busi-
ness professionals from San Diego — ranks com-
petitors through five separate “tracks,” or business 
fields. These newly implemented tracks include 
biotech/life science, clean tech/sustainability, high 
tech/IT, social entrepreneur and undergraduate 
students.

“[Having tracks] levels the playing field,” 
Kitishian said. “Before the tracks, the judges would 
complain that they couldn’t figure out who was the 
best because the two companies were in completely 

different fields. It also helps our undergraduate 
students, who may be uncertain of entering their 
ideas along with graduate students with more 
experience.”

Challenge organizers have come up with several 
ways to assist participants who are unsure about 
their ideas. Along with helping to diversify their 
talent pool and access online resources, the orga-
nizers put on several educational workshops and 
social events throughout the quarter. These events 
allow participants a chance to learn from and 
network with UCSD professors, business venture 
capitalists and other professionals.

“It’s really a lot of exposure and safe environ-
ment in which to try out your ideas and to learn 
to go through that valley of death, from univer-
sity-based innovation to an actual company with 
five or so clients,” said UCSD medical postdoc-
toral fellow Ned Sahin, a second-time participant

and one of the challenge’s orga-
nizers. “Through events, you have 
contact with venture capitalists and 
mentors, who are CEOs of compa-
nies. Last year they also gave away 
free one-on-one time with patent 
lawyers. Normally you’d be paying 
hundreds per hour.”

In addition to the social events, 
challenge organizers assign each 
team a mentor, who may be a suc-
cessful business entrepreneur, law-
yer, accountant or other business 
professional. These mentors spend 
a minimum of one to two hours 
of one-on-one consultation with a 
selected team each week to help 
ideas progress.

“With mentors, we get profes-
sionals we’d like to see come to the 
organization, who we think par-
ticipants would like to work with,” 
Kitishian said. “The great thing is 
that the organizers are students also. 
We know what you’re looking for. 
When people say they want to see 
the CEO of Invitrogen, we go out 
and get them. We try to get every-
body involved.”

With all these resources, 
Thurgood Marshall College senior 
Robert van Nice agrees that the 
competition is an invaluable step-
ping stone for those who want to 
become entrepreneurs. He plans to 

enter the competition for the first 
time this year within the clean-tech 
track.

“You’re not competing with actu-
al business plans,” Nice said. “It’s a 
competition for just ideas. Whereas, 
in the entrepreneurial sector, you 
never know if you’re getting the real 
story because people are waiting for 
their patents to go through before 
they can talk about it. Here, you can 
let everything out in the open. This 
gives us a chance to really get our 
name out there and start network-
ing with the right people. And, so 
someday, our ideas might change 
the world.”

However, the competition is not 
merely a hypothetical situation for 
some participants. NeuroVigil, a 
recent start-up company designed 
to help people with sleep apnea, 
not only won last year’s chal-
lenge, but also the Bay Area’s pres-
tigious Draper Fisher Jurveston 
Competition. NeuroVigil, headed 
by UCSD Salk Institute graduate 
Philip Low, is now opening an office 
in La Jolla. 

After participating in the contest 
last year, Sahin founded BodySure, 
a company that uses new technol-
ogy to detect skin cancer in its 
early stages in a low-cost and more 
convenient manner. Additionally, 
he has founded a company in 

Delaware.
“I founded two companies that 

are registered; they’re real corpora-
tions,” Sahin said. “I have applied 
for and begun the process of apply-
ing for government grants and 
discussed the idea with venture 
capitalists and angel investors. That 
being said, none of them is run-
ning them in the marketplace yet. 
In a year, I plan to mature one of 
them.”

However, the point of the compe-
tition is not to receive money or start 
a business, according to Kitishian. 
The contest is to give students an 
idea of what it takes to become an 
entrepreneur, even if it means mess-
ing up.

“If we can get you to fall a 
couple times while you’re here at 
school, by the time you’re starting 
your own company, you’ll be okay,” 
Kitishian said. “You have to go 
through this process at least once 
or twice. You have to have perse-
verance.”

damage and the possibility of falling 
hazards, but represent a low possibil-
ity of loss of life. The only exception, 
Hellman said, was University House 
— the historic chancellor’s residence 
— because of its older architecture, 
but it is currently being supported and 
strengthened.

According to Fialko,  most campus 
buildings are steel-framed, designed 
to withstand damage and have little 
chance of collapse. Even older build-
ings on campus have held up to code 
and are expected to react similarly.

“Earthquakes are unpredictable on 
what kind of effects they produce,” 
Hellman said. “In some cases the short-
er buildings would resonate with a par-
ticular earthquake period, sometimes 
the opposite happens. We can’t predict 
exactly and that’s why we do our best to 
comply with building codes.”

The damage to UCSD would likely 
come in localized quakes.

“Rose Canyon is an active fault 
in our backyard,” Fialko said. “It is 
capable of damaging earthquakes, but 
we still know little about its history 
and the average repeat time of signifi-
cant ruptures.”

UCSD is also focusing on what it 
could do for other campuses in the 

case of a large earthquake. Among 
other possibilities, UCSD may be 
able to send aid and even offer 
instruction to UC Riverside, which 
is in position to bear the brunt of an 
earthquake.

“For Riverside we would most likely 
be a resource,” Van Saun said. “We are 
in a position to offer aid and even help 
bear the load of the students in that 
area if necessary. [UC campuses] are 
all interconnected so we would be sure 
to offer some kind of assistance.”

In addition, Van Saun said the uni-
versity may play a role in helping the 
larger area, by supplying energy from 
its local power grid or sending out 
student volunteers like it did during 
last year’s wildfires.

Van Saun stressed earthquake pre-
paredness as the best measure of safety. 

“I don’t think it’s apathy, but it’s 
taking the time to make [earthquake 
preparedness] a part of life,” Van Saun 
said. “If you’re a victim of a violent 
crime, you take precautions to be pre-
pared in the future. Likewise, if you 
experience an earthquake, you’re more 
prepared. But we obviously want to be 
prepared in the first place.”

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  11

Senior outside hitter Rebecca 
Bailey led the Tritons with 16 kills and 
Reis contributed 14 digs. 

Against Humboldt State the previ-
ous night, UCSD fought early to con-
trol the upset-minded Lumberjacks 
before getting into a rhythm and 
showcasing its serving. 

The Tritons failed to get their offense 
going early on, and Humboldt capital-
ized on this struggle, battling to control 
the game and taking a 24-21 lead late 
in the set. Condon and Schmidt pulled 
UCSD out of its slump by delivering 
three crucial kills, with Schmidt again 
elevating her play to deliver the final 
block in the comeback. 

The second set was similar to the 
opener as the Tritons failed to click 
on offense but rallied late to take the 
win. Trailing 22-21, UCSD made a 
push after a Condon kill and an ace 
by senior defensive specialist Michelle 
Torres. At set point, Condon sent down 
the game-ender off an assist by Chen. 

After falling in the third set, the 
Tritons began to show offensive life 
early in the fourth game, taking a 
6-2 lead following a kill by Bailey. 
The Lumberjacks fought back to 
come to within a point at 6-5, before 
the Tritons finally got their offense 
rolling. Condon hit three kills and 
Williamson served up three aces as 
UCSD came together for its largest 
margin of victory in a single set this 
season. 

Torres, who finished the night with 
nine digs, felt that even though the 
Tritons looked good offensively, it was 

their defense that really made the dif-
ference in the final period.

“Our passing and our defense sig-
nificantly improved during the last 
set,” she said. “Our defenders finally 
began picking up on their hitters’ ten-
dencies, which made it difficult for 
them to score against us.”

On the night, Condon finished 
with a career-high 20 kills on .447 
hitting, while Chen added 50 assists 
and six digs. 

Heading into the playoffs, the team 
feels that the key to success is control-
ling its own play by focusing on its 
strengths, according to Torres.

“We really want to continue to 
build on our serving and passing,” she 
said. “As long as we maintain focus 
on what happens on our side of the 
net and the things we can control, we 
will be able to execute our game in 
any gym without being dictated by 
the level of play of our opponents or 
the crowd.”

UCSD entered the previous week 
as the No. 2 ranked team in the region, 
and will face CSU Los Angeles in the 
first round of the NCAA Pacific West 
Regional Tournament on Nov. 20 at 
San Bernardino. Despite ending the 
season on a sour note, the team is 
looking ahead.

“We are ready to get after it and 
show everyone what UCSD is capable 
of,” Reis said. “When we are focused 
and playing our game we should be 
unstoppable.”

overtime win on Thursday, our legs 
were gone. Credit our team though as it 
kept playing those final 15 minutes the 
way they did. We took it to them.” 

UCSD prevailed in its fifth dou-
ble-overtime match of the season as 
freshman forward Shelby Wong netted 
her first career goal to lift the Tritons 
over BYU-Hawaii. She received the 
through pass from fellow freshman for-
ward Sarah McTigue in the box, get-
ting a one-on-one opportunity with the 
Seasider goalkeeper. 

From there it was all Wong, who 
put a one-touch on the ball and drilled 

it past the goalkeeper for the golden 
goal.

With the departure of five seniors, 
it will be up to those 14 freshmen, the 
newcomers and the rest of the return-
ing squad to battle out for the starting 
positions. 

“Lexi [Zattarain] will be a senior 
and Lisa Bradley will be a junior next 
year,” McManus said. “They’re our old-
est returning starters. This year was 
hard, but next year is going to be 100 
times harder.”

D-I Gauchos Race Past Tritons in Dual Meet

By Matt Croskey
Senior Staff Writer

WOMEN’S SOCCER — Senior for-
ward Natasha Belak-Berger scored No. 
19 UCSD’s lone goal in a 3-1 loss to No. 
4 Seattle Pacific as the Tritons made 
their exit from the Division-II National 
Championships.

Playing in the postseason for the 
22nd time in 23 years, the Tritons 
notched a first-round victory over 
BYU-Hawaii 1-0 in double overtime 
two days before being bounced by the 
Falcons. 

The Tritons finish their season 15-
4-4 with a California Collegiate Athletic 
Association crown and a promising 
future.

Head coach Brian McManus gave 
credit to the seniors for helping a young 
squad mix and get to a level no one 
expected the team to achieve.

“No one knew what to expect to 
start the season,” he said. “To get where 
we did was tremendous.” 

Seattle Pacific drew first blood with 
a 30-yard strike to the right corner in 
the 27th minute. The Falcons would 
strike again only 22 seconds before half-
time. With time ticking down, Seattle 
Pacific drew a corner kick and was able 
to get a head on it to slip it by Triton 
senior goalkeeper Jessica McGovern.

It took only another three minutes 
out of the half for Seattle Pacific to 
score again on a ball that was tipped by 
UCSD’s senior defenseman Amanda 
Esquivel for an own-goal, according to 
McManus.

McManus said the team reacted well 
to the goal right before halftime, but 
the quick goal in the second half was 
the killer.

“We went into the locker room 
thinking that there was no reason to 
panic,” he said. “We were still in the 
game. If we would have got through the 
first 15 minutes of the second half, we 
would’ve had a better chance.”

Belak-Berger scored her final goal 
as a Triton in the 79th minute as she 
maneuvered her way into the box, drib-
bling through three Falcon defenders 
and sending a well-placed shot to the 

back left corner of the net. It was her 
team-high 13th goal of the season. 

The Tritons had another chance to 
pull within only one when freshman 
Anne Wethe slipped her way past the 
Seattle Pacific defense and drilled a 
ball just wide of the net. The shot, had 
it gone in, would’ve given the Tritons a 
serious opportunity to steal the game, 
McManus said. 

“I know [Seattle Pacific’s] coach and 
he panics,” he said. “He tells the team 
to just kick the ball toward the end of 
games and that’s when our chances 
came. To be fair, Seattle Pacific had an 
excellent team and they were in the 
Final Four last year. I expect the winner 

of its game against Western Washington 
to make it back to the Final Four this 
year.”

The Triton defense had only surren-
dered three goals in the last seven games 
combined before allowing three against 
Seattle Pacific. It was the first time 
since the 2005 campaign that UCSD 
has allowed three goals in one game.

McManus said the Tritons’ grueling 
schedule of six games proved to be too 
much for UCSD, especially facing a 
rested Seattle Pacific squad.

“The CCAA Championship was the 
final straw,” he said. “With the double-

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The 
No. 11 Tritons split their final regular 
season games of the year by defeating 
Humboldt State 27-25, 25-22, 18-25, 
25-10 before falling to Sonoma State 
25-23, 27-25, 21-25, 23-25, 11-15. 
Reflecting back on the final regular-
season games, junior outside hitter 
Karen Reis said the team excelled at 
meeting challenges during the season 
and expects the Tritons’ resiliency to 
continue into the playoffs.

“This year our conference play was 
tough, but hopefully all that competi-
tion prepared us for regionals,” Reis said.
In the Saturday night match at Seawolf 
Gym, UCSD had trouble stopping 
Sonoma State’s senior outside hitter 
Kristy Sather who finished the night 
with 22 kills. 

In the opening game, UCSD fell 
behind after Sather hit consecutive 
kills to give Sonoma State an early 
4-1 advantage. The Seawolves main-
tained their lead despite freshman 
outside hitter Katie Condon’s efforts 
to ignite a UCSD rally. Behind 20-
17, Condon and junior outside hitter 
Sylvia Schimdt got the momentum 
rolling for the Tritons with back-to-

back kills, and UCSD pulled to within 
one point. The Tritons went on to take 
the set on Schmidt’s ace. 

The energy from the opening 
game carried into the second set with 
the Tritons taking a commanding 
20-13 lead. Following a timeout, the 
Seawolves responded with a 7-0 run to 
tie the game at 20. Both teams battled 
to take the set, with UCSD winning 
behind the play of freshman outside 
hitter Hillary Williamson. Williamson 
broke the 25-25 tie with a kill and 
allowed the Tritons to take the game 
on  junior setter Elaine Chen’s ace. 

The third and fourth games were 
closely contested, with the Tritons 
unable to orchestrate scoring runs. 
Sather came to life for the Seawolves 
with five kills in the fourth set to bring 
Sonoma State back from being down 
10-3, and the fifth set was forced after 
a 23-23 tie was broken by a Triton ser-
vice error and another Sather kill. 

The Tritons appeared to regain 
their offensive rhythm early in the 
decisive fifth game and took a 4-1 
lead. However, Sonoma State immedi-
ately fought back to tie the score at 11, 
taking advantage of UCSD miscues to 
close the match.

SWIMMING & DIVING — Friday 
night usually serves as a break for 
most students who have just com-
pleted a tough week of school, but 
the swimming and diving team 
spent last Friday night resting on a 
team bus on its way back home from 
a swim meet at UC Santa Barbara. 
The Tritons had a strong showing 
but it was not enough to overcome 
the Division-I Gauchos, who won by 
a score of 157-104 on the women’s 
side and 177.5-75.5 for the men.

Even though they fell short, the 
Tritons were not discouraged by the 
performance. According to head 
coach Scott McGihon, the swim-
mers actually had a very strong 
showing at the UCSB match.

“We swam pretty well,” McGihon 
said. “We had one of our best meets 
at Santa Barbara, and we had some 
pretty fast swims in preparation for 
the Nike Cup next weekend.”

McGihon pointed out several 
key swimmers who had particu-
larly excellent swims. Sophomore 

Anju Shimura took first place in 
the 100-yard backstroke and in the 
200-yard backstroke with times 
of 58.63 and 2:06.03, respectively. 
Freshman Alexandra Henley took 
first in the 550-yard freestyle with a 
time 5:03.70 and second in the 200-
yard individual medley with a time 
of 2:08.93.

“We had an OK dual meet,” 
senior captain Aubrey Panis said. 
“We had a few standout perfor-
mances but it is a tuneup for next 
weekend’s meet.”

Senior captain Steven Hardy 
took second in the men’s 200-yard 
backstroke with a time of 1:56.04 
while junior Pablo Carrillo placed 
second in the 100-yard breaststroke 
with a time of 59.34. Junior Todd 
Langland, who took second in the 
100-yard freestyle with a time of 
46.81, also finished strong.

The meet against the Gauchos 
served as preparation for next week-
end’s Nike Cup in Long Beach, a 
highly competitive meet that has 
featured swimming powerhous-
es Stanford University and the 
University of Southern California in 
the past. With such a short amount 
of time to prepare for the meet, the 
Tritons are determined to perfect 
their finite stroke specifics and focus 
on their turns and starts to make the 
most of the next competition.

“We just need to remember that 
the next meet is just another meet,” 

McGihon said. “We’re eager and 
ready to perform next weekend. It’s 
a long season, and we just need to 
take it in stride and prepare for each 
meet. The mental preparation is an 
ongoing process and we just need to 
keep the regionals in mind.”

After a tough meet, the Tritons 
must mentally and physically pre-
pare for the Nike Cup. The Nike 
Cup features some of the best com-
petition in the state, in an attempt 
to prepare teams for the competitive 
nature of the division meets.

“We swam faster at this meet 
than last meet, which is good to see 
right before the Nike Cup,” senior 
captain Daniel Perdew said. “We’re 
going to see some good competi-
tion.” 

The Tritons will have their work 
cut out for them, mentally preparing 
for such a large competition after a 
short week of practice. 

“We just need to recover and 
rest,” Perdew said. “The coaches will 
focus on the workout, we just need 
to relax.”

Nevertheless, the Tritons are 
excited about the chance to compete 
in the Nike Cup, which runs Nov. 
20-22. The Tritons won’t compete 
in their home pool until Jan. 10 
when they will face rival Loyola 
Marymount University.
