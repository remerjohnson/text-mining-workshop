Volleyball Championship Called 
Off by NAIA: Tritons Too Good 

BY SCOlT ALLISON 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's dominance of 
West Coast small college 
volleyball ended Wednesday 
when the NAIA took its nets 
and went home. 

The intercollegiate 
or g anizing body has 
announced that it will not hold 
c hampionships because 
UCSD was far better than its 
competition. 

'We couldn't find a west 
coast NAIA squad interested 
in going because UCSD would 
be there, and UCSD has blown 
them all out," said Dick 
Theibert, Assistant Executive 
Director of the National 
Association of Intercollegiate 
Athletics. . 

La Verne, Cal Lutheran, 
and BYU Hawaii are NAIA 
teams Theibert specifically 
cited as having both financial 
troubles and realistic foresight 
of their chances as reasons for 
declining an NAIA champion. 
ship invitation. All three 
.dtooia have been conaistently 
manhandled by the Triton 
spiker. this year. 

Beside. obvious UCSD 
supremacy in the National. if 
they were held, Theibert also 
attributed the cancellation to 
"the inflationary and 
receaaionary crunch adversely 
affecting school budgets at this 
lime." 

Even though Triton 
votleyb.1I coach Doug 
Damevik was hatf-expecting 
the new., it atiII hit hard. 

"I'm very disappointed, for 
this leaves us out in the cold 
with no place to .,. We had a 

legitimate chance to win, :.:r we've been working so 
t..d for 10 lone to peak at the 
rilht lime," he laid. 

AlI.League setter Steve 
Upp, thou&h not bitter, had 
good reason to look forward to 
probable Triton aucceaa at the 
Nalionala. 

"I've been on this team for 
fOW' year" and this year 
looked like our best chance," 
he said. 

Damevik sees cancellation 
of this year'. N AlA 
championahipe as an omen 
that next season's may never 
mataialize either. Therefore a 
jump to an NCAA level may

UCSD ComDlittee to 
Get Anti-9 Vote Out 

BY BARRY MEEPOS 
StalfWrk 

With the June 3 election leu 
than two months away and the 
"apocolyptic" Proposition 9 
looming in the di.tance, 
UCSD has initiated a voter 
information and registration 
program a. a pa •• ive 
re.i.tance against the 
initiative. 

Chancellor McElroy 
recently appointed David 
Ern.t, a .. i.tant vice 
chancellor of adminiIIration, 
to chair a UCSD Proposition 9 
Steering Committee compo-
led of faculty, students and 
staff representin, the f(eneral

ne purpose of the 

committee, according to Em.t 
i. "to develop mechanilm. for 
effectively cornrnunicatinl 
information about Prop. 9 to 
the UCSD campus communi· 
ty." McElroy sees the function 
of the conllnittee as a way "to 
focus in on the educational 
vote" and achieve a higher 
voter turnout. 

The committee is legally 

precluded from advocating a

initiative, but the "impartial"

Committee Wednesday untij 
an opinion from the Attorney 
General could be obtained. 

Presently, California ' s 
students rights of access and 
privacy concerning their 
records are set out in the 
federal Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act, and 
the state Education code. 

Students are not included, 
however, in the state's 1977 
Information Privacy Act, 
which provides civil penalties 
and penalties for employees 
who violate the provisions of 
the act while acting in their 
official capacity. 

The questions submitted to 
the Attorney General is 
whether students have rights 
similar to those provided to the 
rest of Californians through 
the IPA. 

The bill , AB 3107, 

sponsored by Berkeley 
Assemblyman Tom Bates, il • 
designed to fitl in the gaps in 
the laws regulating students 
rights by amending the 
education code to include 
enforcement procedures for 
wronged students. 

"The university claim. it 
already has such procedures in 
its present policies," said 
Bates, "but we want to make 
sure." 

According to UC Student 
Lobby Co·director Arniel 
Jaramillo, the issue is not the 
university's compliance with 
present state and federal laws. 

"I am impressed with the 
effort the university has made 
in attempting to comply with 
such laws," said Jaramillo. 

Unfortunately , Jaramillo 
contends, the existing laws 
and policies do not go far

Finer Details of 'Deep 
Stand-by' Draft Explained 

BY JEFFREY LEE 
!>lall Write, 

In response to an invitation 
from the UCSD 's Draft 
Registration Committee, 
Kathy Gilbert of the National 
Lawyers' Guild addressed the 
committee yesterday on the 
progress of Carter's draft 
legislation, and the Itrategy of 
possible deferments to 
induction. 

In the hour long talk to 
various members of the UCSD 
community, Gilbert explained 
some of the finer details of the 
proposed registration 
legislation, and the draft in 
general, which included: 

-Current legislation for 
funds for the registration of 
men between the ages of 18to 
21 is stiU in the House 
Appropriations Committee, 
which is on recess until April 
15. 

-Under current law Carter 
can at any time call for the 
registration of men between 
the ages of 18 to 26 without 
congres.ional approval. The 
legislation presently in 
congress is for the funda 
needed for the actual 
registration process. 

- The penalty for refusing 
to register for the draft is now a 
maximum sentence of five 
years and/or $10,000. There 
may be changes of the severity 
of the sentencing to tIvee y~ 
and! or $50,000 under the 
new laws now· being 
considered. 

- The Selective Service ia 
now in "deep stand·by" which 
mean. that there are no local 
or state draft boards or 
personnel, but there is a

duty to carry out the wishes of 

. the public and ita elected 
officials-not to formulate 
public opinion. 

With re,ard. to the 
........ delivered by Mr. 
Saxon. it is important to note 
that .overnn..t SPeIICIina hu

inflation it i •• till a net iroereaae 
of 21 percent l1Ie question: 
Ha. the quality or quantity of 
IIOvernment services reaDy 
increued since 1975? 

Proposition 9 will cut taxes. 
and just 81 important. it will 
permanently index them to the 
rate of inAation. Under Prop. 
9. the lower income taxpayer. wi. get a much peater 
percentage tax cut than ~r 
income taxpayen. for 
instance. a person earning 
$10.000 or Iell wil receive a 
tax reduction of 75 percent. 
whereas a person earning 
$50.000 or higher will receive 
a 49 percent reduction. l1Ie 
I ... ge corporation.. which 
have corne under alot of 
aiticiarn recently. will receive 
NO tax reduction. 

f' lIlally. the issue of tuition 
must be addressed. I believe 
that all the tuition talk i •• imply 
a lC81e tactic that is being used 
by .tate and university 

The Daily Cu.rdian 

officials. similar to other scare 
tactic. used in the Proposition 
13 debate two years 8110. 

However. if tuition i. to 
become a reality it would 
create some positive results. 
The poor and lower income 
individuals would no longer be 
paying for the education of the 
middle and higher income 
bracket students. And a moat 
important point never brought 

up is thatthoae who pay tuition 
and then gel a job after 
graduation wiD corne out far 
ahead financially in the long 
run because of the lower taxes 
they will be paying. Also. the 
diHerence in cost between 
private and (subsidized) atate 
universities would decr~e. 

The result? The forces of 
the marketplace would dictate 
that those .chools which offer

the most lor a student's dollar 
would get the most students. • 
Increased competition among 
colleges and universities would 
cause the general quality of 
education offered to students 
to rise. As Professor Milton 
Friedman has pointed out. the 
educational ay.tem is not and 
should not be immune from the 
forces of the marketplace.

that the U.S. is the aggre.sor 
in the world. and that the 
USSR is merely defending 
itself. The ab.oIute consi.ten· 
cy wit h which the Soviets have 
pursued domination over 
others has made that view 
untenable even to the 
politically myopic or Leninist. 

l1Ie modern fad i. to say, 
with great cyrWcism. that this il 
the nature of lUpe!"pOwera. and 
that both should back oH and 
let the Third world develop in 
peace. 

Here. here. When poor 
countries IIpeIld biUions each 
year on arms pushed on them 
by both sides, who could argue 
with that? 

I'U be the last to .ay the U.S. 
hal been Galahad in the world. 
Unta Carter entered office, in 
fact. I was usually 
asharned ... and he'. only made 
me feel beller, not happy. 

But the historical record of 
the United States is infinitely 
beller than that of the USSR. 
The .tory .tart. at the end of 
WWII. 

In aU of human history. 
every nation that has become 
powerful and come upon an 
opportunity for empire. hu 
seized the chance with both 
hands. This W81 true until 
1946. when the U.S. easily 
could have conquered the 
world. and didn·t. 

The Truman doctrine 
developed not 01 the war's end • 
but three ye.... later. for 
several years the wartime pro. 
Soviet propaganda mill 
continued to churn. in 
Washington. It was no 
inevitable jockeying of world 
power. that led to the doctrine, 
but the brutal murder of 
M8Iyryk and thou.and. 01 
others when the Iron Curtain 
fell on Ea.tern Europe. 

To our shame. we he/"eJ 

genuine Stalini.ts a bIoddy rag 
to wave. Often there was a 
policy vacuum. into which 
American banks stepped with 
alacrity. to our .hame. 

Yet to look at the record is 
to see a cancer on the face of 
the world. spreading from 
Moscow. 

To blame "Soviets" beg. 
the question. Even renaming 
their hegemony over captive 
peoples a "Russian Empire" 
only improves the picture 
.Iightly. Anyone who spent 
any time seriously talking to . 
Russians would tell you tltAt 
the problem really is MOicow. 

A great historical tr.,edy 
occured when the Great State 
of Kiev fell. and left the 
leaderahip of the ea.tern 
Slavic nation to the despotic 
heirs of Ivan the T enibIe. No 
libera' ever occupied the 
Kremlin lor more than II lew 
months. l1Ie walla mu.t be 
cursed. The briDiant. moody. 
courageous RUliian people 
have been ruled nonstop by 
par anoid personalities. both 
before and after the 
"Revolution. " 

No wonder Russian. tend to 
be pessimi.ts. 

Sidney Len. suRests that 
an oHer by the US not to 
emplace new battlefield 
millile. in Europe would be 
reciprocated by the Kremlin. 
Hi. naivete i. 8Itonishing. For 
rears the Mutual. Balanced 
Force Reduction talk.

NATO hal offered to let

man and piece of equipment in 
its araenal. (unnecellary 
anyway. 81 it'. aD public 
knowledlJe). Ma.cow hu 
adamantly refused. and inaiata 
that they have over 100.000 
lewer men in Poland and East 

Germany than .py .atellites 
easily .how. 

The same problem has 
come up again and again in 
SALT talk •. The cold, hard 
logic of nuclear weaponry 
demonstrates that we can 
never actually reduce the 
number. of nuclear weapon •• 
and have both sides feel safe • 
until mutual, onsite in.pection 
is allowed. The US has 
offered. Moscow has 
consistently refused. 

US negotiators tell how they 
have tried to explain to 
Kremlin diplomats and 
general. the distinction 
between a "zero-llIIYl" and a 
"positive •• um" game. and that 
Moscow never lleemed to

State Court to Hear 
Minority Preference 
SAN FRANCISCO - The 

California Supreme Court said 
yesterday it will review a lower 
court decision striking down 
the Univer.ity of California's 
preferential admissions policy 
for ·minorities. 

The court granted a hearing 
sought bL the UC Board of 
,Regents. The hearing also was 
sought by the plaintiff in the 
case. Glen DeRonde. a white 
student denied admission to 
the UC Davis Law School in 
1975. 

Chief Justice Rose Bird. 
Justices Mathew Tobriner. 
Wiley Manuel and Frank 
Richardson and Court of 
Appeal Justice Clinton White. 
sitting on assignment, voted 
for the review. Justice Frank 
Newman did not participate. 

At issue are rulings by Yolo 
County Superior Court Judge 
James Changaris and the state 
Court of Appeal in 
Sacramento finding unconsti· 

tutional the minority 
admissions program at the law 
school of the University of 
California at Davis. 

The appeal court's 2·) 
decision on Jan. 21 went much 
further than the U.S. Supreme 
Court's 1978 Bakke decision 
in attackinllaifirmative action 
programs. The court ruled that 
Allan Bakke . a white 
engineer. should be admitted 
to medical school at UC 
Davis. 

The Bakke decision said 
racial quotas could not be used 
in professional school 
admissions but race generally 
could be considered as a faclor 
in making admission 
decisions. 

But the Court of Appeal 
said race may not be 
considered. with or without 
Quotas.

Director of Inflation Council says 
Underlying Inflation Rate Rising 

BY JOHN KLOCK I 
Although intereat rates will come down and a 

receaaion .houId .often demand overall, the 
chances of a .ignificant reduction in the 
underlying rate of inflation in the near future are 
aIim. 

Such was the concluaion of Dr. Robert 
Ruuell, director of the Council on Wage and 
Price Stability, who addresed the .tudenla and 
faculty of the economic. department Tueaday. 
Ruudl will rejoin the faculty next fall after two 
year. with the council in W .. hington. 

Ruuell said the underlying rate, the steady 
wage.price .piral, baa edged up over the last six 
month. from below aeven percent "pouibIy to 
double digit rat ... " 

In evaluating the admini.tration', 
performance again.t inflation, RuaaelI focuaed 
on the underlying rate of inflation rather than 
the Conaumer Price Index, the figure uaually 
reported from as a meuure of inflation. 

(To illuatrate-the difference, imagine a one· 
time hike in guoline prices and heaq oil 
prieea of 50 percent. Thoae two item. make up 
5 percent of the CPI, .0 the CPI for the month 
would lID up 2.5 percent. If no further inaeas .. 
result, the CPI would not riae any more, making 
inflation appe.- to aublide. But if the higher 
COIla ceuae wqes to riae by 2.5 percent, wluch 
then ceuae prices to riae by another 2.5 percent 
etc., the price inc:reue has become part of the 
underlying rate of inflation.) 

RuaaelI ar.,red thai all of the ina .... in last 
year'. inDation rate, compared with the year 
before, w.. accounted for by two eaaentially 
one·time evenla: the riae in interest ratea, which 

enter. the CPI directly through mortgage co.t. 
to homebuyer., and the doubling of energy 
prieea triggered by the Iranian revolution. 

It was jult these volatile componenla that 
produced the depres.ing headlines of the last 
year. In particular, Ruasdl pointed out that the 
oil price riae, triggered by the Iranian 
revolution, and a riae in mortgage co.la to new 
home buyer, accounted for 100 percent of the 
increase in last year's inflation rate over the 
year before. 

IronicaUy, a major portion of the increase in 
mortgage co.la last year was due to riaing 
intereat rate. brought on by the Bovernment'l. 
tight money policy, designed to fight inflation. 

"In the .hort run, high interest ratea are 
inflationary," Ruuellsaia. 

And oil pric .. went up primarily becauae the 
We.tern world, frightened by the interruption of 
supplies from Iran, increased demand .harply 
to build ila stockpilea to record IeYd •. 

"Other sourcea more than made up for the 
deere ... in Iranian oil production. It was the 
increase in demand that ceuaed prices to go up 
.0 much," RuueII .aid. 

The council'. greatest IUceea' ..ems to have 
been in restricting wage growth. It baa been 
estimated that wagea roae two percent lea. than 
thel' would have without the guiddinea. 

The IJUidelinea were Ies. effective on the price 
aide of the .piral, partly becauae corporation. 
avoid re.triction. through accountin. 
techniquea and other Ioopholea. 

"We expect it," he said.

UCSD Ruggers Due in Santa 
Barbara for Season's Climax 

Even Teams From Foreign Lands Will Be There 
BY BARBARA HAAS 

Senior Staff Writer 
The men's rugby team 

takes off for a Santa Barbara 
tournament today following 
62-9 and 24-9 wins over a 
New York side on Tuesday. 

The competition in Santa 
Barbara consists of about five 
games against various schools 
and clubs to be played over the 
whole weekend. Entrants will 
be divided between two 
classifications, a Blue and a 
Gold division. The top clubs 
and the best schools entered 
the Blue division, leaving the 
rest of the lesser clubs and 
schools for the Cold league. 
UCSD, along with most other 
colleges, will be in the second 
division. 

"The Santa Barbara 
Tournament is the climax of 

the whole sealon," said Jeff 
Jones , president of the rugby 
club. "This is the one that 
everyone gets up for . There'l 
going to be about five 
international teams there." 

The Daily': Guardian 

Sports 
" Teams from France, 

England, New Zealand and 
some other places are going to 
be there, plus all the schools 
like SDSlJ. '48 teams all 
together are supposed to be in 
the tournament," said Doug 
Beanen, who coaches the 
Tritons. 

UCSD previously demo. 
lished SDSU two times this 

season, most recently shutting 
them out 27-0. Strong win. 
like this have prompted 
forward Craig Sanders to-term 
this a "banner year." 
Expectation. are ruMing high 
for the tournament, although 
the team member. intend to 
enjoy themselves regardles. of 
the outcome of the 
competition. 

Fortunately, the matches 
won't be as exhausting as the 
one and a half games on 
Tuesday against Xavier High 
School. Xavier, the side from 
New York, makes aMual 
pilgramm~e out to the We., 
Coaat to experience diHerent

"Not having any Nationals

Doug Dannevik. "This is our

Lovich Off Kilter, Zevon On Target, Iggy Off 
Flex·Lena Lovich (Stiff) litany of fuck·off lyrics in front 

of a Quirkishly propullive rock 
and roll band who played 
music for anyone's nervous 
breakdown. New Values was 
a record about Iensory (ne, 
cultural) overload and the 
struggle of the individual to 
fend off the darkness to clear 
space for his own supra-moral 
imperative (.hort-order 
Nietzsche). Soldier is what 
one would expect: more of the 
same, but somewhat toned 
down. Iggy's off-hand humor 
and fish-hook insights abound 
through the lyric sheet 
("Please Mr. Custer I don't 
wanna go/And spend my 
night in a bar with some 
dodo ... ") and the band, 
featuring ex-Sex Pi.tol Glen 
Matlock on ball, profer a 
cultivated ugline... Still, 
Soldier lack. that one all· 
purpose knock out punch, 
lack. the one track that brings 
everything else on the disk into 
a coherent whole. Warren Ze.on 

Lovich, a Detroiter 
transplanted to England where 
she'. become the dar6ng of the 
far fringe of the New Wave, 
can be said to be mannered, 
hyper, and decidedly bizarre, 
traits that usually send me 
running out of the room. StiD, I 
sort of like her, if only because 
her eccentricities are her own 
and no one ellel', and because 
her quirks rise above the level 
of a carnival side show and 
luPply some mUlical interest. 
Flex, however, isn't the beat 
setting for her lingular 
abi6ties. Stateless, her last 
record, wu charged with 
urgent, angular rhythms, 
problematic melodies, and off 
the cuff lyricI concerning 
domination, non-verbal 
communication, and universal 
anglt. Flex usually plod. or 
vibrates 6ke a pleuure bomb 
forever just short of going off. 
Still there are moments of 
awkward fun where her rubber 
balloon SQueal. and fractured

Lawyer Explains Draft 
Continued from pofe l 
national center 01 about 100 
workerl centered in Walhing. 
ton D.C. whose job il to plan 
for the poaaible opening up of 
new local draft boards and 
cIefinin. deferments. 

- Under the new lawl there 
wiD be no c:oIeae deferment 
that was uaed by many to pi 
out from the draft durint the 
Vietnam war, and therefore 
~_ male 18 to 21 is diJible. 

G-.a aIIo spOke about the 
1lrate8Y 01 cWerments to the 
drlllt, IUCh as medic:.l, moral 
and reIi8ioua exeulplion under 
the "4-F-' c:laNification. 

Thia broad cateaorY was 
u..d by IMIl)' to avoid the 
iaduc:tion 01 the lut war, 
Gibrt llid, but added that 

"Good, Itrong documenta tion 
il needed from Itable and 
reliable sources." She also said 
that, "documentation ian't a 
guarantee that you'D gel a 
deferment. " 

"Gays wiD be clauified as 4· 
F by the military," Gilbert l aid, 
"but they al.o need 
documentation from a 
p. ychiatri l t and . om e 
recognized organization like 
the Gay Students' Union 
aaying that they are member. 
of the organization." 

Conscientious objectors are 
claslified into two main 
pt»upI, reIigioua and moral, 
Gilbert slid. 

"It is a good idea for people 
who want to go C.O, to have a 
long . history ," she said, 

The Daily Gu.rdian Friday, April 11 , 1980 

Privacy of Records Pushed 
Continued from PORe 1 
enouKh. What is needed i. a 
vehicTe for student recour.e, 
he . aYI. 

"By providing criminal or 
disciplinary potential for the 
wronsrdoer within the IPA. the 
legialalure intended to in. ure 
policing ability by those who 
are wronged themselves rather 
than relying solely on 
government intervention. This 
same enforcement vehicle 
.hould be accorded to 
students" . aid JaramiUo. 

The Batel bill would 
provide wronged students with 
the possibility of 1Um, the 
cooege or univer. ity in a civil 
court within two years of any 
violation of their rights. 

The court would also be 
empowered to aw ard a 
minimum of $2,500 in 
damages to the student, and 
order the wrongdoer to pay a 
minimum of 50 percent of the 
6tigation costs up to $10,000. 

Failure to maintain accurate 

records, to grant access to 
records within a set period ot 
time, to allow access by 
dec la ri n g th e rec o r d s 
confidential in nature, or to 
release recorda unauthorized 
by the students are the 
violations cited in Bates' bill. 

Nitrous Suspected in Death 
Continued from PtJIle 4 

According to David Strand, 
Revelle Alliltant Resident 
Dean, the ordeal began 
around 9 pm on Wednesday 
night when occupants of the 
dorm notified the university 
police of the mishap, and the 
police . ubaequently notified 
his office. Strand said that the 

police ambulance arrived 
promptly and, a. CPR and 
artificial respiration was 
administered, Howard was 
carried down the dorm stairs 
and taken to the hospital . 

Howard lived in La 
Canada , north of Los 
Angeles, and attended La 
Canada High School.
