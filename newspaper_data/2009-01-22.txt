“

UCSD erupted in applause, 
screams and tears Tuesday morning as 
a fresh generation of political partici-
pants gathered with faculty and staff to 
observe the nation’s 44th presidential 
inauguration.

Screening events at the Loft, 
International House and the Sixth 
College Commuter Lounge offered 
coffee, pancakes and hors d’oeuvres 
to hundreds of viewers eager to 
watch President Barack H. Obama’s 
resounding call for a new approach to 
American politics.

By 8:30 a.m., a crowd of over 
200 — including reporters from San 
Diego’s Channel 6 and Channel 8 news 
networks — had pushed the Loft well 
above capacity to witness the swearing-
in ceremony and presidential speech.

Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 
Kari McNickle, who helped organize 
the Loft’s event, said she was impressed 
by the amount of excitement, attentive-
ness and unity.

“Everyone was really unified in that 
moment,” she said. “No matter who 

you voted for, it seems like everyone is 
coming together now.”

She said she has confidence in 
Obama’s ability to redefine the United 
States’ reputation abroad and inspire 
greater solidarity among citizens at 
home.

“For most of my politically aware 
life, Bush has been president,” she said. 
“[Tuesday], you could really feel proud 
to be an American, and it’s been hard 
to feel that way for a long time.”

Revelle College sophomore Wafa 
Ben Hassine, who celebrated the inau-
guration at International House’s Great 

Hall, emphasized the day’s historical 
significance for black citizens.

“What affected me the most wasn’t 
only how inspirational Obama is as a 
person, but a realization that we have 
an African-American family in the 
White House,” she said. “In my mind, 
this is the prevailing of good over evil. 
Our country suffered with slavery for a 
long time, and this is a sign of deliver-
ance.”

While fellow UCSD students 
crowded around monitors campus-
wide, Sixth College junior Angela Buck 
attended the ceremony in Washington, 

D.C., as part of the national University 
Presidential Inauguration Conference. 
She said this year’s presidential cam-
paign marks the first time in her life 
that she has been excited about poli-
tics.

“When [Obama] was speaking, I felt 
like he was speaking to me as a student 
and as a citizen,” Buck said. “I came out 
of the experience feeling hopeful and 
inspired to do what I can in my own 
way, which is what struck me the most 
about the campaign in general — the 

Revamped Sun God 
Planning in Full Swing
By Reza Farazmand
News Editor

Preparation for the 2009 Sun God 
Festival began earlier this month with 
the release of the A.S. programming 
department’s comprehensive fes-
tival-planning report. The 23-page 
document outlines plans for a festival 
identical in format to the event’s safe-
ty-oriented 2008 incarnation, though 
programming officials have indicated 
the possibility of decreased securi-
ty, a new Internet-based wristband 
retrieval system and unrestricted re-
entry. 

Throughout preliminary plan-
ning stages for this year’s festival, 
A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Programming and chief Sun God 
organizer Garrett Berg has stressed 
the goal of reinventing the event 
within its new, safer format. Berg’s 
department faced widespread criti-
cism after last year’s festival, which 
many students claimed violated the 
traditional Sun God spirit by restrict-
ing the day’s events to an enclosed 
RIMAC Field and eliminating the 
no-boundaries, campuswide format 
that had characterized the festival for 
the previous 10 years.

“In the 2008 planning report, our 

goals were all about security, because 
we really wanted to revamp the fes-
tival in order to be able to con-
tinue to have it,” Berg said, referring 
to threats by campus administra-
tors in 2007 to dramatically curtail 
the event if security concerns were 
not addressed. “This year, it’s much 
more about having this new format 
and deciding how to make it better 
for the students.”

John Muir College senior Daniel 
Dadon — who, after last year’s festi-
val, started a Facebook group encour-
aging students to voice their concerns 
over the new format — said that he 
was most discouraged by the lack of 
mobility and absence of independent-
ly administered attractions through-
out campus at Sun God last year.

“I really didn’t like how they cor-
ralled the students and didn’t let us 
have our whole-campus Sun God like 
we used to,” Dadon said. “We weren’t 
able to be on Library Walk. We weren’t 
able to be in Price Center. The festival 
just wasn’t happening there.” 

Although this year’s main attrac-
tions will still be staged entirely on 
RIMAC Field, Berg hinted at plans 
to expand the event into other areas

OUT-OF-STATE 
ADMISSIONS

By Kimberly Cheng
Associate News Editor

In anticipation of further cuts in 
state funding, University of California 
officials are debating the possibility of 
increasing out-of-state and interna-
tional student enrollment to help fill 
the gap in revenue.

Less than 10 percent of the 
220,000 undergraduates and gradu-
ates currently enrolled in the UC sys-
tem are from out of state. However, 
according to the U.S. Department 
of Education, roughly 16 percent of 
students enrolled in public four-year 
colleges and universities nationwide 
are from other states and countries.

Tuition for in-state students at UC 
campuses falls at an estimated $8,100 
per student, while out-of-state stu-
dents pay more than $28,000. Only 
about half the extra $20,000 is used 
to cover the university’s costs, UC 
officials said in a statement.

“It might generate some revenue,”

UCSD surpassed the campus-
wide recycling goal for 2008  — set 
by the UC Board of Regents at 50 
percent — by diverting 67 percent of 
trash, construction debris and solid 
waste from landfills.

“We’re very proud of breaking 
through to 67 percent,” Campus 
Sustainability Coordinator Maggie 
Souder said. “It shows how serious 
our students, faculty and staff are 
about sustainability solutions.”

UCSD came in second behind 
UC Davis, which reached a 69 per-
cent diversion. 

The achievement marks signifi-
cant progress toward future cam-
pus recycling goals of 75 percent 
by 2012 and 100 percent by 2020, 
which would require a considerable 
increase in dedication to recycling 
and sustainability by the entire cam-
pus community.

“To get to the point where we’re 
sending zero waste to landfills in 
11 years, though, every person on 
campus will have to help,” Souder 

said. “We can provide the tools and 
knowledge, but we’ll need a total 
recycling mindset throughout the 
university.”

According to assistant superin-
tendent for Landscape Services and 
Refuse and Recycling in Facilities 
Management Alonso Noble, the uni-
versity was able to recycle a sig-
nificant portion of the 19,000 tons of 
solid waste produced this year, put-
ting to practice aggressive recycling 
efforts in the area of construction 
and debris.  

“At three major construction 
projects — Price Center expansion, 
Prebys Music Center and North 
Campus Housing — we achieved 
about an 80 percent diversion rate 
through working with our construc-
tion partners,” Noble said. “Those 
are very big numbers.”

Materials ranging from scrap 
wood to concrete and asphalt are 
either recycled or reused, and con-
tractors are required to track and 
record exactly how much is diverted. 

The housing, dining and hospi-
tality department has also signifi-
cantly increased recycling initiatives 
in recent years.

motto of enacting change through not 
only what [Obama] can do, but what 
we all can do in our own way.”

Despite their 
overwhelmingly 
optimistic atti-
tudes about the 
next presidential 
term, students 
a c k n o w l e d g e d 
the sobering list 
of challenges that 
the country’s new 
leader will face. 
The current eco-
nomic recession 
has led to the 
highest national 
unemployment 
rate in 16 years, 
and prospects for post-graduate jobs 
are limited.  

John Muir College senior 
Amanda Ripley, who plans to pursue 
a career in writing after graduation, 
said she hopes Obama will imme-
diately begin to address the nation’s 

ailing economy and mend its broken 
health-care system.

“Health care makes all the dif-
ference,” she said. “It’s such a basic 

human need, and 
having it solves so 
many other prob-
lems.”

A.S. All-Campus 
Senator Garron 
Engstrom added 
that the economy in 
particular cannot be 
revived overnight. 
However, he said he 
remains in awe of the 
American democrat-
ic process.

“We peacefully 
turned everything 
around,” he said. “We 

were discussing how cool it is that we 
can do that in the U.S.”

UC spokesman Ricardo Vazquez 
said. “But I wouldn’t call it profit, and 
I don’t know the amount.”

Though boosting out-of-state 
and international admission rates 
may help the public university sys-
tem cushion funding cuts, officials 
opposed to the idea argue that it 
could filter out qualified local appli-
cants.

“When we start chasing that 
money as a substitute for state money, 
that’s bad public policy,” UC Regent 
and Lt. Gov. John Garamendi said in 
a statement. 

Vazquez said California-resident 
enrollment is unaffected by out-of-
state admissions because enrollment 
targets and local-applicant admission 

are based on state funding. He added 
that the university has no established 
quotas regarding out-of-state and 
international student acceptance rates.

UC Regent Judith Hopkinson 
recently asked the university’s gov-
erning board to consider increasing 
out-of-state and international enroll-
ment, citing not only its financial 
benefits but also the social advantag-
es of creating a more geographically 
diverse student body. 

Hopkinson said enrolling between 
15 percent to 20 percent of nonresi-
dent undergraduates will benefit the 
university financially in the long run.

The UC system has a revenue 
target equivalent to about 17,800 stu-
dents — including those from out of 
state and country — for both under-

graduate and graduate programs, and 
although the university will come 
close to meeting its goal this year, it 
has fallen short of that target by over 
1,000 students for the past four years, 
according to Vazquez.

Additionally, out-of-state applicants 
are held to higher admission standards, 
such as greater GPA and SAT score 
requirements, which can help raise the 
university’s national rankings. 

“Our main mission has always 
been serving California high school 
graduates,” Vazquez said. “We have 
a guarantee for California residents 
that we don’t have for out-of-state 
students.”

The A.S. Council was under pressure last night to come to a conclusion on the hotly con-
tested Gaza resolution, with hundreds 
of students filing into the meeting to 
offer pro- and anti-resolution state-
ments. A week after being instructed 
to draft a joint resolution by the A.S. 
Council, students from both sides 
of the debate gathered at last night’s 
meeting to voice support and con-
cerns over the newly-amended docu-
ment.

Due to the Monday’s ceasefire in 
Gaza, the sched-
uled meeting 
to draft a joint 
resolution was 
cancelled, but 
the Students for 
Justice in Palestine 
remained confi-
dent that the amended resolution was 
fair, citing supporters among UCSD 
student groups and faculty.

“This is a resolution sponsored 
by a coalition of students and the 
ethnic studies department at UCSD,” 
Arab Student Union President Rena 
Zuabi said. “It is your responsibility 
as educated members of society to call 
upon your government to address the 
grievances of a people. I implore you 
to stand for this diverse community, 
to stand alongside your fellow UC 
schools.”

UCLA student Randa Wahbe and 
co-author of UCLA’s own resolution 
on the matter, which was recently 
approved, spoke on behalf of a UC-
wide coalition of various humanitar-
ian student groups in support of pass-
ing the resolution at UCSD, calling 
the situation in Gaza a “humanitar-
ian crisis, not a political issue.” She 
continued by reading an open letter 
written by Michael Provence, UCSD 
associate professor of history, in sup-
port of the resolution.

“I write to endorse the statement 
of the undergraduate students of the 
ASUCSD who have called for an end 
to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza,” 
Provence wrote. “As the resolution 
eloquently concludes, only by end-
ing the humanitarian blockade can 

the healing process begin for both 
Palestinians and Israelis.” 

Those opposed to the resolution, 
however, described the document 
as an attack on Israelis and many 
requested the council to remain neu-
tral in the Gaza situation to elimi-
nate the inevitable alienation of one 
group.

“I am asking you to remain neutral 
on this issue to avoid an extreme hit 
to the feelings of value and belong-
ing of the pro-Israel members of our 
community,” former A.S. member 

Adi Singer said. 
“A.S. Council, 
please respect our 
desire to work on 
negotiating inner-
community peace 
before tackling 
international con-

flict.”
The public input portion ended 

abruptly despite a long line before 
the podium. Revelle College Senator 
Katie Hall motioned to allow mem-
bers of the public to be placed on the 
speaker’s list and the council agreed.

Councilmembers expressed grief 
over the situation in Gaza, but were 
divided over the council’s authority 
to take a stance, hesitant to make any 
hasty decisions. 

“I still don’t agree that this is what 
A.S. does,” Associate Vice President 
of Academic Affairs Lana Blank said. 
“We’re here to talk about two commu-
nities that don’t agree and we’re not 
going to be the group that says you’re 
right, we’re wrong. If this is what A.S. 
does, I don’t want to be a part of it.”

After nearly four hours of discus-
sion, the council voted not to pass the 
resolution. Vice President of Student 
Life Darryl Nousom motioned to cre-
ate a special committee instructed to 
draft a new resolution to be presented 
to the council Feb. 4. The committee 
will consist of Associate Vice President 
of Diversity Ricsie Hernandez and 
Revelle College Council Chair John 
Lintern as moderators, two other 
councilmembers and four members 
each from both the pro- and anti-
resolution constituencies.

Council Rejects Gaza Resolution 
After Five-Hour Discussion

of campus.
“We feel there are ways to make 

it feel like Sun God across campus,” 
Berg said. “Last year it definitely 
didn’t feel like Sun God. We realize 
that. Even if every single student had 
gone to the festival, it still wouldn’t 
have felt like Sun God. So what we’re 
looking into are ways we can cre-
ate the Sun God atmosphere across 
campus.”

Berg described preliminary sug-
gestions for achieving this goal, 
including holding individual Sun 
God kickoff events within each 
of the six colleges and staging a 
student-organization fair on the day 
of the festival.

Changes to the festival’s primary 
events will include the elimination 
of the north stage, which last year 
hosted a number of local music acts, 
and will be replaced by an enormous 
tent featuring continuous deejay sets 
throughout the day. 

Berg also discussed the adoption 
of a new wristband retrieval system 
that will require students to register 
online for entrance to the event. 
Wristbands will then be distributed 
upon entry into RIMAC Field, and 
attendees will be allowed to enter 

and exit the venue freely. 
Though precise security logis-

tics for the 2009 festival remain 
undetermined, Berg said he hopes 
that the success of last year’s dra-
matically increased safety measures 
in deterring arrests will convince 
campus administrators to consider 
looser security for this year’s event. 
The insistence of campus admin-
istrators on heightened security in 
2008 resulted in a $35,000 police 
bill for the programming depart-
ment — an increase of $20,000 from 
2007. Accordingly, last year’s festival 
yielded 55 percent fewer arrests than 
were reported at the 2007 event. 

“Ideally I would love to see 
that [price of security] go back to 
$15,000,” Berg said. “I think that, 
for me, the most difficult thing is 
that we moved to an undeniably 
safer festival, so why we’re spending 
$20,000 more is my question. At the 
end of the day, we spent $15,000 at 
what was a very problematic festival, 
so why are we spending $35,000 at 
what was unanimously decided to be 
a successful festival?”

UCSD Police Chief Orville King 
said he believes the 2008 festival was 
a relative success when compared 
to the event’s prior incarnations, 

though he said he is unsure in such 
early stages of planning as to what 
sort of security levels may be present 
at this year’s event.

“I think last year’s festival was 
certainly an improvement over pre-
vious years,” King said. “The event 
was well-organized, and we had 
fewer problems as a result of the way 
the event was set up. But we really 
don’t know where the event is going 
or how the event is being planned. 
We really need to see what the plan 
is before we can make [a plan for 
security].”

Berg said his department has 
already confirmed two of the fes-
tival’s headlining acts, and while 
verifying that the primary headliner 
will be a hip-hop act, Berg plans 
to withhold the names of all acts 
until Spring Quarter. Though work-
ing with a budget similar to that of 
2008, Berg said that Sun God 2009’s 
musical selections will dramatically 
improve upon last year’s.

“Our headliners for this year so 
far, both of them, are so much better 
than our headliner last year,” Berg 
said.

Props to the British Broadcasting 
Corporation for actually coming through 
on Inauguaration Day with a functioning 
real-time online video stream.

Flops to “Koala TV” for a mediocre 
comeback premiere, which was

 filled with unattractive nudity 
and tired humor.

It doesn’t matter how many bouncey houses and over-priced grease-stands they pack 
onto RIMAC Field — that doesn’t 
make getting penned in for five 
hours of Coheed and Cambria and 
the “Beautiful Girls” dude any less 
painful. Especially when washed in 
memories of the glorious Sun God 
Festival past, that annual cross-cam-
pus Judgment Day on which even the 
most respectable biology major was 
reduced to a poster child for com-
plete and total debauchery. When 
the day stages were nixed and the fes-
tivities quarantined to discourage all 
unregulated pre-RIMAC celebration 
(seeming to account for the main 
chunk of arrests and near deaths), it 
did seem that the heart of Sun God 
had finally ceased to beat.

The details of this year’s festival 
are still being kneaded out, but the 
verdict is clear: We’re sticking to the 
new format. The infamous Sun God 
on which we’ve so long thrived — 
technically the only reason half of us 
haven’t yet dropped out — has been 
structurally curbed to officially ruin 
the one day a year that makes up for 
all the miserable others. 

But things aren’t as bad as they 
seem. A.S. Associate Vice President 
of Programming Garrett Berg, 
though forced to comply with the 
administration’s updated security 
regulations and other evils that 
largely prevent us from holding a 
soap fight in the Price Center foun-
tain, has expressed his desire for 

every student at UCSD to wake up 
and know it’s Sun God. And honestly 
— paired with newly lifted regula-
tions on re-entry to RIMAC Field, 
which will allow us to roll in and 
out as we please — that could solve 
everything.

Because in the end, the students 
are the ones responsible for making 
Sun God awesome. Think about it: 
The daytime booths, underattended 
Price Center stage (easily replaced 
by a boom box) and random stu-
dent-org activities have always 
served as placeholders anyway; any-
one who lived the festival’s glory 
days knows that it’s all about slath-
ering on the war paint, breaking 

out whatever portions of that pirate 
costume you can find lying around 
and parading through campus like 
you own the place. The University 
Events Office has rented out Sun 
God lawn to deter any shenanigans, 
but that didn’t stop the Koala staff 
from borrowing the water key and 
setting up their legendary slip ‘n’ 
slide last year, and it shouldn’t stop 
the rest of us from getting creative 
this time around. 

All we have to do is remember 
that what happens at Sun God stays 
at Sun God, wake up at the crack of 
dawn for a head-clearing refresh-
ment and do our part in bringing 
back the glory.

Dear Editor,
With threats of global warming 

and environmental degradation, it 
is important to consider the effects 
of our eating habits on the environ-
ment. To produce a single pound 
of beef requires 5,214 gallons of 
water; compare this to 23 gallons 
per pound of lettuce and 25 gallons 
per pound of wheat. The National 
Institute of Livestock and Grassland 
Science found that the produc-
tion of 2.2 pounds of beef gener-
ates more carbon dioxide than an 
average car does after traveling 160 
miles. Though a good start, with 
sources of water dwindling and the 
greenhouse effect of carbon diox-
ide, we must try to do more than 
buy fuel-efficient cars and reusable 
grocery bags. When we consider 
the amount of resources used to 
produce meat compared with that 
of fruits and vegetables, and that all 

of the essential amino acids can be 
found in such combinations as rice 
and beans, a peanut butter sand-
wich and many additional alterna-
tives to meat, making a conscious 
decision to protect our environment 
becomes less threatening to the con-
venience of a meat-eating lifestyle. 
In order to live in a sustainable 
manner, we must consider how our 
actions impact the environment. A 
significant part of such sustainabil-
ity includes adopting a vegetarian 
lifestyle.

Dear Editor,
Last Friday, 60 of the University 

of California’s lowest-wage workers 
went to the San Francisco office 
of UC Regent Richard Blum. The 
purpose of their visit was to talk 
with him directly regarding their 

contract. During their visit, the 
workers asked to meet and/or talk 
with Regent Blum in person or 
by telephone. When Regent Blum 
denied their request, 20 of these 
low-wage service workers sat down 
and refused to leave.

Currently, 96 percent of the 
university’s 8,500 service workers 
receive such low wages that they 
qualify for at least one form of pub-
lic assistance. Service workers felt 
that after over a year and a half of 
little action at the bargaining table 
by the leadership of the UC system, 
it was necessary to deal directly with 
the leadership themselves.

Unfortunately, UC President 
Mark G. Yudof ’s response to the 
plight of these workers was business 
as usual. Instead of moving to imme-
diately solve this contract and meet 
the university’s moral responsibility 
to provide workers a wage that will 
not keep them and their families in 
poverty, President Yudof wrote a let-
ter to AFSCME Local 3299’s presi-
dent expressing his strong feelings 

that worker actions such as these 
must stop.

This clearly shows that once 
again the current leadership of the 
UC system only cares about those 
few individuals at the top and that 
they continue to turn their backs 
on the real pressing needs of 8,500 
of their employees who they pay a 
poverty wage.

In answer to this misguided let-
ter, AFSCME Local 3299 President 
Lakesha Harrison has responded 
today to President Yudof.

We All Must 
Clean Up Our 

Acts to Fix 
This Mess

Unless you were severely intoxicated for the past cou-ple days, you are surely aware 
that our great nation inaugurated a 
new president on Tuesday — one 
Barack Hussein Obama. As expect-
ed, the event brought out masses of 
cheering people who watched him 
become the official leader of the free 
world. Unfortunately, the nanosec-
ond immediately after Obama spoke 
the words “so help me God,” the end-
less list of problems that are currently 
plaguing the United States were not 
magically fixed. Apparently, Obama 

is not the supernatural political deity 
that we all hoped he was. He may well 
follow through on many of the prom-
ises he has made, but it is unwise to 
think that simply electing him will 
fix this country. In fact, if you listen 
closely, the change that Obama has 
preached since he began his presi-
dential campaign has very little to do 
with him. In his inauguration speech, 
he continued to underline this point 
— if we, as a nation, want to improve 
our quality of life and solve our prob-
lems, we shouldn’t kick up our shoes 
and expect a super-politician to do 
all the dirty work. Rather, we should 
bear the responsibilities of change.

At this point you may be asking 
the following: “Brent, I hear what you 
are saying and I really want to help, 
but how can I fix the economy, clean 
the environment and rehabilitate our 
image abroad?” Simply put, nobody 
— not even Barack the Great — 
can weather this poop storm alone. 
But we can personally embrace the 
change our Chosen One has been 
talking about this entire time. 

Take the economy for example. 
I think it’s safe to assume that no 
students at UCSD were the heads 
of banks and mortgage companies 
who decided to make irresponsible 
loans to unqualified applicants. Nor 
were any Tritons involved in global-
sized Ponzi schemes that subsequent-
ly bankrupted innocent investors. 
Although we must now deal with 
the reality of these corrupt decisions, 
they can teach us an important lesson 
of fiscal responsibility and hopefully 
change the way we operate when it 
comes to the bankroll. 

 But it’s not just the head honchos 
who are contributing to the problem. 
For many of us, the credit card is our 
best friend. We see something we like 
and before we can say “foreclosure,” 
we swipe it without realizing that 
we are spending money we probably 
don’t have. This much is clear: unless 
you are earning an annual six-fig-
ure salary, you probably don’t need 
a Louis Vuitton bag or sweet new 
rims for your Honda Civic. Growing 
up as a Southern California native, 
I have witnessed obscene sums of 
money that young people spend on 
designer sunglasses and clothing, and 
I will readily admit that I have been 
guilty of this myself. But this lat-
est financial collapse has certainly 
opened my eyes to Obama’s message 

See DISUNION, page 5

On the surface, a recent proposal by University of California officials to 
increase the number of out-of-state 
applicants seems like a quick and 
harmless method for raising revenue. 
Not only would half of each student’s 
average $28,000 annual tuition be 
used as profit for the system, but 
campuses, according UC Regent 
Judith Hopkinson, would also benefit 
from more “geographically diverse” 
student bodies.

But as cash-strapped officials 
consider recruiting well-off students 
to solve the university’s financial 
woes, there’s just one tiny detail 

they’re forgetting: According to 
university statistics, our system has 
already enrolled 11,000 students too 
many. To make matters worse, the 
Board of Regents plans to increase 
resident tuition fees and cut next 
year’s number of admitted freshmen 
by 6 percent.

If the university is actively limit-
ing California residents’ access to 
their own public education, how can 
it justify a proposal to offer more 
spots to out-of-state-applicants? 
Even if the state isn’t technically sub-
sidizing their tuition, that doesn’t 
change the fact that, once admitted, 
these students will be filling already-

crammed classrooms and utilizing 
scant student resources. After all, 
no matter where a student’s tuition 
money comes from, one more lecture 
hall seat for an out-of-stater is one 
fewer for a California resident.

Even disregarding the limited 
access this decision might cause for 
state residents, looking for private 
financial support contradicts the 
university’s commitment to stand 
idependently as a public institution. 
According to UC system spokes-
man Ricardo Vazquez, there are 
no official requirements regarding 
out-of-state enrollee percentages. 
So as officials face more and more 

pressure to find quick-fix finan-
cial solutions, what’s not to stop 
them from increasing the current 6 
percent of nonresident undergradu-
ates to something like University of 
Michigan’s 30 percent nonresident 
population? Why not lose the pub-
lic-access facade all together and 
charge a couple thousand dollars 
more in tuition? If university offi-
cials don’t keep California residents’ 
best interests in mind, the univer-
sity’s goal to provide higher educa-
tion to all of the state’s qualified 
applicants will be at the mercy of a 
collection of geographically diverse 
private pocketbooks.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN By Niven Wilson

By Gabriella Capisani
Staff Writer

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
— Most undergraduates reminisce 
about applying to college — back 
when the whole admissions process 
was a laborious, painful practice 
of laying brick upon brick, until 
a thick wall of varied SAT scores 
and extracurricular regrets stood 
tall between you and your lifelong 
dreams — but those days are long 
gone. 

As the recent economic crisis 
uproots the foundations of so many 
middle-class students, their con-
cerns shift from meeting admission 
requirements to simply making ends 
meet. According to Collegewise.
com, a professional college-admis-
sions blog, high school seniors will 
be applying to fewer schools to 
avoid excessive application fees, and 
private schools will see a significant 
decrease in applications as their 
tuition is just not affordable. 

Meanwhile, students will select 
safety schools based on financial 
security, rather than ease of admis-
sion, which is traditionally the 
case. 

As families struggle to factor 
academia into their tight budgets, 
universities are, for a change, exam-
ining ways to make the process 
less taxing. Along with indepen-
dent help and information that 
applicants can procure from sites 
like Collegewise, the UC Board 
of Regents is considering a major 
change in testing requirements by 
possibly eliminating the SAT II. 
And because high school seniors 
can expect fewer acceptance letters 
now that schools like those in the 
UC system are dramatically scal-
ing down their admissions to deal 
with the fiscal downturn, changes 

such as these are necessary to give 
hard-working high school students 
an break.

It may be frustrating for current 
college students to watch changes 
that will ease the process. Those 
admitted in 2006 saw another fat 
brick added to the blockade before 
them, being the first to deal with 
an additional SAT essay and the 
test’s new 2,400 point value; those 
who applied this past fall experi-
enced possibly the most difficult 
economic year, and may largely be 
forced to settle with lower-standard 
safety schools. 

These undergrads might feel that 
changes discount their own admis-
sion, as less-rigorous demands 
could result in less qualified future 
students. But this is hardly the case. 
University of California officials 
have proposed a 6 percent cut to 
freshman enrollment due to insuf-
ficient state funding — now more 
than ever admissions officers will 
be selecting only the most talented 
applicants. However, the leniencies 
being discussed for 2009 appli-
cants will help lighten the unnec-
essary burdens within the process 
and make college more attainable 
despite the times. Amid a dying 
economy, the cost of merely tak-
ing the SAT may be prohibitively 
high for middle-class students, and 
affording test preparation is unre-
alistic. 

College students’ concerns about 
easing the process are petty when 
set against the financial struggles 
applicants and their families are 
facing. In this time of hardship, the 
University of California is right to 
ameliorate the weighty admission 
requirements.

of self-responsibility. Our president 
can surround himself with all the 
Ivy League economists he wants, but 
if we as a population don’t take the 
time to save and spend our money 
wisely, these problems are not going 
to disappear. I prefer to learn about 
the Great Depression in history class, 
not witness it firsthand.

The way we treat the environment 
and handle our natural resources is 
another trouble area that government 
policy alone will not solve. I, for one, 
am certainly tired of being berated 
by tree huggers who want me to 
wear compostable underpants, but a 
toned-down version of their message 

is important for everyone to hear. 
We don’t all have to become smelly 
hippies to be more environmentally 
friendly. And although Obama pro-
poses the creation of an entire new 
green industry that will focus on 
energy innovation and provide thou-
sands of new American jobs, if indi-
vidual citizens don’t start doing basic 
things like conserving electricity and 
water, it may all be for naught. If we 
all took the time to recycle our post-
rager beer bottles and open windows 
rather than run the air conditioning, 
that would be a solid start. I know 
fixing the environment is something 
that necessitates a global undertak-
ing, but this is America dammit, and 

we are supposed to be leaders.
Throughout history, a politician 

who comes to power based on a 
platform of change can prove to be 
dangerous. There is no doubt that 
Obama’s words have inspired a large 
portion of our population to expect 
more from its government. However, 
we must not fall into the trap that has 
been set for us. We must not let our-
selves be quietly lulled into believing 
a shiny new president will instantly 
solve our problems. Remember what 
our iconic, 35th President John F. 
Kennedy said at his inaugural address: 
“Ask not what your country can do 
for you — ask what you can do for 
your country.”

L ike an inferno cutting through forest bristles, the news that Hearst Corporation had acquired the popular site 1UP.com set the gaming com-
munity ablaze two weeks ago. No one could believe 
it — or, more aptly put, no one wanted to. If the feat 
had been a simple baton pass from one owner to the 
next, there probably wouldn’t have been anything 
to worry about, but the repercussions have been 
far-reaching. 

The Jan. 6 transaction revealed that not only 
had 1Up and its various sister sites fallen under 
Hearst and its UGO.com brand, but that Ziff Davis 
Media had effectively shut down Electronic Gaming 
Monthly — arguably the most popular, respected, 
and longest-running gaming publication in the 
nation — abruptly firing the vast majority of its edi-
torial staff a month before its 20th anniversary. 

I suppose all good things must come to an end; 
however, I didn’t think I, or anyone else, could’ve 
anticipated just how much the end actually seethes. 

 Truthfully, the acquisition shouldn’t have come 
as much of a surprise, especially since Ziff Davis had 
filed for Chapter 11 last summer. I’m sure we were 
all shocked. But surprised? Not likely. 

Ever since key staff members started disappear-
ing, subtle hints of the company’s mismanagement 
were obvious. Well-known personalities like Luke 
Smith, Bryan Intahar and Kathleen Sanders may 
have gone on to bigger and better things, but when 
influential figures like Mark MacDonald and then 
EGM Editor in Chief Dan Hsu became freelance 
writers, it stopped making any sense.

DUST OFF YOUR BOOKSHELVES: THIS YEAR’S 
FANTASY IS BETTER LEFT ON THE PAGE

By Amanda Martinek
Staff Writer        ++++++  

M ost recent in a long line of fantasy paperbacks turned sprawl-ing epic blockbusters, “Inkheart” doesn’t do the genre — or its literary counterpart — much justice. Then again, it’s fitting that 
a movie extolling the imaginative powers of literature degrade the pages 
from which it sprung.

Reading the tale “Inkheart” as a bedtime story to his young 
daughter, Mo Folchart (Brendan Fraser) accidentally frees the novel’s 
characters from their parchments and — with his undiscovered gift 
of “Silvertongue” — gives them life. But, as Folchart soon realizes, his 
gift comes with a price: As part of the bargain, someone from the real 
world must be taken into the book. After accidentally sending his wife 
Resa (Sienna Guillory) deep into the ink, Folchart is then forced to raise 
his daughter Meggie (Eliza Bennett) as a single parent for a long and 
lonely nine years. He spends all his spare time desperately searching for 

another copy of “Inkheart,” hoping to read the fictional characters back 
into the pages and summon his wife in the process.

During their library-crawling quest, the father and daughter meet 
a fictional fire juggler — sporting a surfer’s shag and hip five o’clock 
shadow — seeking to reunite with his book-lorn family. But Mo 
refuses to help him, and Dustfinger (Paul Bethany) turns them over to 
Capricorn (played by a bald, Dr. Evil-looking Andy Serkis), a fictional, 
freshly animated villain living lavishly in our world. Though Mo tries to 
keep Meggie out of the fairytale drama — leaving her in the care of crazy 
bibliophile Aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren) — they all end up at Capricorn’s 
castle, where the real journey of saving Resa and restoring reality (sans 
literary incarnations) begins.

Not only have books coming to life become a worn trope in recent 
years, but “Inkheart” follows closely on the heels of “Bedtime Stories,”  
a just-released film boasting similar plot lines (and that wasn’t

T here’s the Golden State, the Golden Poppy, and of course, the Gold Rush; ever since the first screams of “Eureka!” trembled down the Sacramento Valley back in 1848, California’s legacy has been defined by its relationship 
to that little nugget of truth found up in the nether reaches of NorCal. Likewise, 
ever since the Morning Benders released their debut album Talking Through Tin 
Cans — whether you take advice from the guy behind the desk at Lou’s Records 
in Encinitas or the critics over at iTunes — all ends of the spectrum seem to agree: 

The Morning Benders have struck gold.
Their liberation-rock revolt voraciously bobs its sea of grinning heads to a 

hand-clappable procession of steel wheels, churning out bohemian fantasy as if 
beneath an open-air freight, cruising across the Pacific countryside. Berkeley vir-
tuosos play an acoustic-guitar laden, piano-pounding drive to wrap us in an earthen 

core of redwood — the exact aural remedy for stress-
ridden muscles and dramatic winter tussles.

And how could one snag their ears a piece of such 
fantastically golden musical sensation? Well, like any 
chunk of precious metal, we’ve simply had to wait 
for the goods to sift through the silt and make their 
way down south. The morning contortionists will be 
kicking off their tour from a perch within the glitter-
ing glass walls of UCSD’s newest performance space:.
the Loft. 

Accompanied by the new-age folk duo of Los 
Angeles duo the Submarines — more often than not caught in the cathartic blades of a 
genre blender — the Morning Benders will bring your ears to their toes, your toes into 
rhythmical throes and your face to a state that would make any mirror exclaim, “Wow, 
it glows!”

The Morning Benders will play at the Loft on Thursday, Jan. 29. Doors open at 8 p.m.

T he Honorary Title are a bit of an oddity in the college music scene. Wailing adolescent love songs over undistorted guitar chords, the Brooklyn-based musicians’ flippant hair cuts and good-boy looks 
only further the impression that they belong on your 14-year-old sister’s 
iPod. The thrift-store chic of guitarist/vocalist Josh Gorbel and drum-
mer/vocalist Adam Boyd suit them better for a guest appearance on “One 
Tree Hill” than they do than at the Loft — full sleeves with an indie-Ken 
aesthetic.

But to superficially dismiss the duo is a disservice to their musi-
cal acuity. It’s not quite arena rock — no soaring refrains, nothing 
that’ll make you scream nonsensical lyrics along with your speakers — but 
Gorbel’s range, complemented by unshakable sincerity, is compelling enough to command 
Price Center East for a few short sweet ones. There are moments on their sophomore album, 
Scream and Light Up the Sky, that recall the Killers, but despite Gorbel’s strained and stately cries 
about suburbia and teenage love, the Title never quite reach the grandeur or production value 
demanded by an egomaniac like Brandon Flowers. There are even a few riffs that seem, unex-
pectedly, inspired by Johnny Cash — if Cash penned empty threats about breaking up with his 
unresponsive girlfriend (“If you don’t pick up the phone/ You will regret it/ I’ve said it before/ But 
this time I mean it”) instead of, well, shooting men in Reno just to watch them die.

The band’s youth lends an eager anticipation to their music, an upbeat optimism that you 
might have been missing since your Spice Girls days. Flushed with hope and idealism, lost in a 
music scene constantly pushing electro-experimentalism, it’s a welcome (if unexpected) reminder 
of feel-good guitar pop’s many virtues. The Honorary Title aren’t edgy or trendy, and they cer-
tainly won’t be showing up on the pages of Pitchfork or the Hype Machine anytime soon. But 
what they do attempt — unashamed indie rock guided by achingly earnest vocals — they clearly 
achieve, with the simple acoustic strings of a songwriter undistracted by the world-weary postur-
ing of outside music buffs. If nothing else, their honesty is worth a detour from Burger King. 

The Honorary Title will play at the Loft on Saturday, Jan. 24. Doors open at 8 p.m.

“Burn After Reading”
PRICE CENTER THEATER / JAN. 20 & 26 / 9 P.M. / $3

Battered in a distinct “As I Lay Dying” sense of dark 
idiocy, eccentric characters profiled by nuanced actors are the 
hallmark of any Coen comedy. Once again mixing oft-casted 
actors (George Clooney, Frances McDormand) with new hires 
(Brad Pitt, John Malkovich) in “Burn After Reading,” Joel and 
Ethan look to repeat the formula of their comedic schema 
with another misanthropic spin on a marginal genre.

It might not look like a spy thriller — “Miller’s Crossing” 
doesn’t resemble a jidaigeki and “The Big Lebowski” is  
certainly not film noir — but the tale of scheming, cartoonish 
opportunists in “Burn After Reading” takes many a cue 
from CIA capers, exaggerating and embellishing moronic 
plotlines wherever it sees fit. (EG)

Tapes ‘n Tapes

CASBAH / JAN. 25 / 8:30 P.M. / $15

The ear-muffed, plaid-claid boys of Tapes ’n Tapes have 
moved from the log-cabin creaks of their earliest endeavors to 
the more refined charm of latest album, Walk It Off. Funny — it 
seems like they don’t have much to walk off, with highbrow 
Pitchfork praise and a legion of indie blogophants skipping in 
their wake. Still, the Tapes have managed to retain their dorky 
humility, singing sugary blues with polka-kicked urgency to rival 
the Pixies. Sure, they’re just four pretty little fish in a big indie 
pond — but it suits ‘em just fine. (SM)

Crying Light
■ Antony and the Johnsons
SECRETLY CANADIAN

We all know the world is crying. But it’s never been 
quite so clear as when caught in the throat of the weepy, 
towering Antony Hegarty, burdened at English-Irish 
birth with the androgynous hugeness of Mother Nature’s 
own voice, now heaving that entire pain in each moment 
of song: No matter where you splice it, it’s as if someone 
had, all at once, sounded every rung in a grand, falling 
forest of organ pipes.

“Mama in the afterglow/ When the grass is green with 
grow/ And my tears have turned to snow,” hollows the 
wheezy-beautiful she-man into album climax “Kiss My 
Name,” finally finding enough peace in his own natural-
ness to step back and realize — too late, it would appear 
— that he and we, the rest of humanity, have officially 
failed the nature that composed us.

Gone are the queeny, art-folk contributors and self-
conscious operahouse theatrics that beautified 2005’s 
sophomore I Am a Bird Now, on which its headmaster 
grasped at the day when all would fall into place, when 
he could finally osmosis out the woman inside. But the 
poise and fearlessness Hegarty has found in so many 
artistic partners — the combative Bjork, the defiant disco 

at DFA, those unashamed CocoRosie lez-dolls — has 
helped to shed years of scar tissue. On the revelatory 
Crying Light, Hegarty rolls around in the sheets of both 
deathbed and cradle, mother and father, love and soli-
tude, accepting life in all its awkwardness and no longer 
bleeding for change. Meek, swishy lounge drums and an 
understated score of organic keys and strings (and the 
occasional reed) by composer Nico Muhly leave no cur-
tain to hide behind, and still, Hegarty doesn’t overcom-
pensate for the added spotlight to his one-woman show. 
Choruses are never more than monologous refrains, and 
themes are lolled out with such impeccable cool as to 
feign improvisation.

Without Hegarty’s hermit shell, the voice that always 
stole our breath is now almost blinding. “I’m gonna miss 
the sea/ I’m gonna miss the snow,” he spreads across the 
“Another World” piano with impossible softness, fully 
exposed to the harsh air outside his inner turmoil but 
finally ready to bear that greater weight.

Noble Beast
■ Andrew Bird
FAT POSSUM

I f 2007’s Armchair Apocrypha was Andrew Bird’s attempt to flock masses with lip-smacking pop appeal, Noble 
Beast is clearly the stuff that keeps them 
coming back, filled to the teary brim with 
classic Bird tenderness. His overlay of 
hand-clapping on an impressively whistled 
melody recalls a spray of wildflowers, each 
puposeful beat barely traceable from the 
melodic swarm but always merging seem-
lessly with the next, threading a carefully 
woven sonic plush.

Beast charts an idyllic springtime land-
scape, where barely a quiet pessimism 
dares to linger. “Squint your eyes/ And 
no one dies,” croons our generation’s Pied 
Piper in “Oh No.”

But “Anonanimal” shakes the Bambi 
pleasantries with anxious violin pizzicatos 
and harplike swells. At any moment, in 
these waves of moody string surges, it 
seems as though all might give way to 

thundering storm. But just in time, Bird 
expertly reigns in the waves of tension 
without catharsis for a full five minutes, 
never letting us tip too far over the edge. 
Besides, “Anonanimal” is phenomenal for 
its multisyllabic wordplay: “See a sea anem-
one the enemy will see the sea anemone/ 
And that will be the enemy,” Bird effort-
lessly rattles atop a heavily crashing string 
quartet. Here, the internal rhythm of lan-
guage overwhelms its dribbling meaning.

There are no obvious hits on Beast, 
which would suffer if not for the sheer 
dexterity and wisdom of Bird, more than 
enough to keep us patient. The album is a 
masterpiece of subtle complexity — emo-
tional, not sentimental; smart, not smarmy. 

Andrew Bird will perform live at SOMA 
on Feb. 15.

Cranes
■ Cranes
DADAPHONIC

C omparing Cranes’ lead singer Alison Shaw with the infa-mous Dadaist rocker Don Van Vliet — better known to most fans as Captain Beefheart — may seem a relatively 
strange proposition. Although both musicians possess voices 
of the sui generis variety (which, in this age of manufactured 
carbon copies, already makes them both cool) their pitches 
will nonetheless draw inevitable repulsion from many a 
listener. Shaw’s childlike vocals recall a mythical siren, 
emerging from an infinitely placid lake at the center of some 
nebulous forest, goading and drawing the weary traveler 
through an impenetrable haze — exactly the sort of thing 
that (understandably) pisses off a lot of people.

The Cranes’ sound has done some heavy evolving over 
nine studio albums, emerging from a more riff-heavy shoe-
gaze to a subtler, softer and more ethereal place. Over 20 
years after their debut, Shaw’s stark vocals are still in com-
plete command, met halfway with the ubiquitous acoustic 
stylings of brother and bandmate Jim and a comforting set 
of electronic blips and pulses, all backed by a quiet thump-
ing.

“Wonderful Things” is the self-titled album’s standout 
track, showcasing not only marvelously seductive, insidious 
guitar work, but some of she-Shaw’s most powerful vocals 
— proving that, despite her breathiness, she is still a capable 
of a good belt — and poetic lyrics possess a genuine tender-
ness and mystery to the saga.

“Worlds” serves as the album’s radio-worthy single, 
opening with those familiar pulsating strings and accompa-
nied by a genial electro-blip, but waxing catchy one-third of 
the way in as the Cranes slyly segue into a friendly, upbeat 
promenade that demands instant replay.

The remaining tracks sparkle with the same thorough 
contemplation, allowing a band that’s more than been 
around the block to reach a young, tangible beauty and 
evoke a richly sensual universe often lost on tired vets to the 
business. Unfortunately, nothing about Cranes transcends 
pretty to grapple with the unexpected. All that the band 
attempts to do, the Cocteau Twins and Slowdive could do 
just a little better (and already have). The track list also tends 
to slip into a sort of repetition, causing us to unwillingly 
enter a struggle with relatively sustained bouts of boredom 
— something that could never happen while experiencing 
superior dreampop like Slowdive’s Pygmalion. 

Of course, this should not relegate Cranes to the used bin 
— far from it. The music therein is so reflectively unpreten-
tious that it completely flies about the new set of mediocre 
shoegazers; in fact, there’s a good chance that — seeing how 
well time has treated them thus far — we’ll see these birds 
take flight. But for now, we’re happy to let them preen.

Contributing Writer

many questions have been raised 
regarding 1Up’s future.  What’ll 
happen to all the talented editors, 
writers and producers who were 
let go? What’ll be made of popular 
podcasts “The 1Up Show” and “1Up 
Yours”? And what’ll become of the 
community that 1Up helped foster 
for an entire decade? But of all the 
questions to ask, I think the most 
important has yet to be approached: 
Why is it that we care? Companies 
fold. People get fired. So what makes 
the departure of EGM and its staff so 
painful?

At a time when most gaming 
publications acted as vehicles for 
commercial hype, purporting the 
popularity of a given console (read: 
Nintendo Power), EGM’s coverage 
was admittedly a big fucking deal.  
Upon its inception, the publication 
made a point of staying unbiased and 
covering almost any significant game 
for every available system, anywhere 
in the world.  

The impartiality of gaming jour-
nalism may be a standard today, but 

it’s only because EGM blazed fron-
tiers. And while the most obvious 
benefits of the magazine’s objectivity 
were the honest previews and reviews 
of both upcoming and existing games, 
EGM’s greatest success spawned from 
its ability to take its readers seriously. 
As both video games and gamers 
became more sophisticated over the 
years, so did the magazine.  

Remaining true to its impartiality, 
EGM began addressing the percep-
tion of gaming within the general 
public with topics ranging from video 
violence and narrative structures to 
video games as fine art. And once 
EGM combined with 1Up’s online 
publication, its writers themselves 
became household names — well, 
maybe not in every neighborhood. 

Due in large part to the bril-
liant success of the site’s numerous 
podcasts, 1Up did what EGM never 
could: destroy the unconscious bar-
rier between writers and readers.  
Podcasts gave the staff real human 
qualities, experts could finally relate. 
In conjunction with editor blogs and 
message boards, 1Up built an expan-

sive community for gamers from the 
toil of the older gamer generations. 
EGM’s editorial staff became our 
voice, expressing our opinions and 
asking our questions to those in and 
outside of the industry. They became 
as much a part of us as we became 
of them.

It’s with great sadness that we 
say farewell to a legendary publica-
tion and the imagined community 
we once called home. Though there’ll 
never be a magazine that could pos-
sibly fill the void that EGM has left 
(and 1Up.com will inevitably con-
tinue to exist), we all know it’ll never 
be quite the same. 

But even still, EGM’s story does 
have a silicon lining. The talented 
individuals who made the 1Up pod-
casts such a resounding success have 
recently gone on to make podcasts of 
their own — one of which, Rebel FM, 
currently sits pretty in the No. 2 slot 
on iTunes. So while it’s a sad time for 
gamers everywhere, at least we can 
know that the ghost of a great will 
continue to make its well-deserved 
presence known.

very good to begin with). But at least 
Adam Sandler has personality; what 
has Fraser done in recent memory to 
make us crave a copycat? 

Though audiences might be 
expecting a goofy, warm-hearted 
“George of the Jungle,” what they get 
instead is a somber, know-it-all father 
figure that comes off as two-dimen-
sional, boring and somewhat whiny. 
Though the young Bennett’s acting 
prowess comes as a pleasant surprise, 
her character is written as a tad too 
mature for a prepubescent 12-year-
old. Fortunately, Helen Mirren (who 

seems above something of this sort) 
anchors the film, providing confec-
tionary comic relief and a reason for 
anyone over 50 to watch the movie.

Surprisingly, the only character to 
spark a flicker of emotional response 
is Dustfinger, who provides an expres-
sive range that effectively drives the 
rather wimpy plotline. Despite playing 
a fictional character, Bethany exudes 
more selfish sincerity and complexity 
than anyone else on cast.

To its credit, “Inkheart” is still 
decently crafted at the peripheries: 
It boasts a superb score that cap-
tures climate and mood with preci-

sion and keen cinematography that 
recalls a luscious vista in the European 
countryside, spiced up by moderately 
applied pyrotechnics and over-the-top 
special effects.

Kids that have grown up on Grand 
Theft Auto and Reese’s Pieces for break-
fast know a thing or two about what’s 
exciting and what’s lame. Fortunately, 
“Inkheart” falls further into the lat-
ter category — its flashy 106 minutes 
barely merit a $3 Blockbuster fee — but 
if you’re looking for somewhere to 
deposit your grandparents while on 
babysitting duty, they’ll be thrilled for 
the in-theater nap.

to come out to games, the foremost 
being the Tritons’ current undefeated 
record in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. Riding an eight-
game winning streak, the women’s 
team returns home to face Cal State 
Stanislaus on Jan. 23 and Chico State 
University on Jan. 24, two teams that 
have seen slow starts to their seasons 
thus far.

Cal State Stanislaus comes into 
its game against UCSD tied for sev-
enth place with a 3-5 conference 
record, and last year’s CCAA cham-
pion Wildcats currently stand at 4-4 
in the conference, good for fourth 
place. The Tritons are currently in 
first place and on a quest to become 
the first team in conference history 
to post an undefeated CCAA record 
for a full season.

“We don’t want to get compla-
cent,” Martin said. “We’re taking it 
one game at a time and continue to 
progress and get better as a team.”

On the men’s side, UCSD cur-
rently owns a 5-3 CCAA record and 
has won its last two games. The 
Tritons, defending CCAA champi-
ons, will host the conference’s cellar 
dwellers in Cal State Stanislaus and 
Chico State. UCSD won its last two 
games after losing three games in a 
row — a rough stretch that accounts 
for all of the team’s conference losses. 
The Triton men will try to stay on 
the winning track at its home games 
this weekend.

“Hopefully more people will 
come out to support us and help us 
win more games,” Stuckey said.
 
Readers can contact Janani Sridharan 
at jsridhar@ucsd.edu.

After losing its first set 30-28, 
the men’s volleyball team bounced 
back against Cal Baptist. Throwing 
down five aces, UCSD dominated 
the second set 30-27. With a lead as 
big as 24-18 in the third set, UCSD 
only saw the lead close gaps as the 
Lancers came back to win it 32-30.

The highlight of the match for the 
Tritons came in the fourth set, where 
UCSD appeared defeated and chased 
a five-point deficit. Thanks to three 
errors by Cal Baptist and Sprangler’s 
three kills, the Tritons grinded to tie 
it up at 26, eventually rallying ahead 
to win the fourth set 30-27.

In the decisive fifth set, UCSD 
came out strong, scoring the first 
five points. The Tritons were led 
by Spangler and sophomore outside 
hitter Joel Davidson who recorded 
kills early on. In a tug-of-war set, 
Cal Baptist sealed up its victory and 
ended on top with a fifth match 
point.

“We need to maintain overall 
consistency in order to be success-
ful,” Leserman  said. “I thought we 
played well throughout the game, 
but a couple of mistakes cost us a 
win.”

Junior outside hitter Jason 
Spangler led the Triton attack with 
21 kills on .327 hitting, while junior 
opposite Frank Fritsch added 15 
kills. Guthals added 14 kills on .458 
hitting, while sophomore setter Phil 
Bannan had 56 assists. Leserman 
also had a strong match for the 
Tritons, recording 11 digs.

The Tritons also faced No. 5 UC 
Irvine on the road on Jan. 21, but 
scores were not available at press 
time. UCSD will face another top-10 
team — No. 8 UCLA — on the road 
on Jan. 23.

HOT CORNER

THURSDAY, JANUARY 22, 2009

By Janani Sridharan
Sports Editor

Nearly 1,500 students piled into 
RIMAC Arena on Jan. 20 ready to 
meet the UCSD basketball teams at 
the eighth annual Triton Jam. With 
free food, contests and prizes, the 
Triton Jam served as a precursor to 
Spirit Night, UCSD’s annual show-
case of school spirit that takes place 
this year on Feb. 20. 

“The Triton Jam is roughly pat-
terned after Midnight Madness, but 
instead of doing it in the fall before 
the first day of practice, we do it 
before the first home game after the 
holiday break to reintroduce the bas-
ketball teams who haven’t played at 
home in a while,” Senior Associate 
Athletic Director Ken Grosse said.

The spirit rally consisted of shoot-
ing contests for students — as well as 
a few professors — and included priz-
es ranging from free Spring Quarter 
textbooks to a new iPod Touch.

Despite the enticing prizes, the 
real highlight of the event was the 
introduction of the Triton basket-
ball teams. Members of each team 
introduced their fellow teammates, 
revealing personal and sometimes 
embarrassing quirks and character-
istics.

“It’s pretty funny when we get to 
talk about each other,” junior guard 
Leilani Martin said. “It lets the stu-
dent body know that we have a per-
sonality.”

 The men’s team did more than 
just talk about themselves: Senior 
guard Shane Poppen performed a 
daring jig upon introduction and 
freshman guard Kirby Ruiz showed 
off his air saxophone skills, earn-
ing considerable applause from the 
mainly student audience.

“It’s fun to see other people on 
campus,” redshirt senior forward 
Brett Stuckey said. “Most of the time, 
I just see people walking to class, so 
it’s nice to get a chance to meet and 
talk to them.”

While the Triton Jam was a good 
opportunity for students to interact 
with UCSD’s basketball squads, the 
Tritons hope that the fans will come 
out in larger numbers to the games 
this season. On average, 899 specta-
tors attended men’s basketball games 
and 438 attended women’s games at 
RIMAC last season. 

Women’s head coach Charity 
Elliott and men’s head coach Chris 
Carlson also addressed the crowd, 
emphasizing the importance of stu-
dent support. Carlson spoke in par-
ticular about a group of 18 students 
that supported both teams through-
out their 2007-08 campaigns.

“Eighteen doesn’t sound like a lot, 
but it matters,” said Carlson in his 
address. “This weekend I hope to see 
not 18, but 1,800 students.”

The No. 21 women’s basketball 
team has given fans plenty of reasons

FENCING — The UCSD fencing team 
spent the extra-long weekend taking 
part in the biggest competition of the 
year: the North American Cup, a four-
day tournament in Louisville, Ky. The 
prestigious international spectacle fea-
tured the most talented group of fencers 
that the Tritons will face this season, 
including some of the best fencers from 
around the United States as well partici-
pants from Canada, Bulgaria, Ireland, 
Sweden, Israel and Ukraine.

Head coach Heidi Runyan said she 
believes the North American Cup was 
an important stepping stone in prepar-
ing the Tritons for the stretch run.

“Our team really got acquainted 
with some higher caliber fencers over 
in Louisville, and it will help us in some 
future competitions, especially the one 
in Notre Dame,” Runyan said. “Our 
team is much better prepared for the 
rest of the season, thanks to this experi-
ence.”

All told, the competition consisted 
of six events, a men’s and women’s tour-
nament for the sabre, epee and foil. 

The men’s epee hosted a total of 245 
competitors, making it the biggest event 
of the weekend. Jon Normile of Metro 
New York was the champion, and four 
of his teammates joining him in the top 
10 overall. Junior Nick McGuinness 
was the top Triton finisher in the event, 
filling the 154th spot. Fellow junior Jed 
Bassein also took part, finishing 190th. 
Freshman Casey Gillcrist was the only 
Triton to take part in the women’s epee 
which featured a field of 112. She stum-
bled into a 107th-place finish, while 
Courtney Hurley of Texas took home 
the title.

Two UCSD fencers battled in the 
men’s sabre among 145 participants. 
Luther Clement of Metro New York 
took home another championship for 
his school as senior Bryan Kim led the 
way for the Tritons with a 77th-place 
finish. Triton junior Karl Chodakiewitz 
ended the competition in 134th place. 
Monica Aksamit from New Jersey won 
the women’s sabre, a competition in 
which no UCSD women took part.

The Tritons did their best work in 
the men’s foil, with freshman Michael 
Fong placing 44th in the event, the 
highest ranking of any UCSD fencer in 

any event. Runyan was impressed with 
Fong’s solid freshman campaign, calling 
him “a real talent” who has “legs like 
springs.” She added that Fong is “a big 
reason why foil has become our stron-
gest event as a team.” Gerek Meinhardt 
finished first overall, beating out his 
teammate David Willette in the finals. 
Triton freshman Armin Chan was also 
part of the 188-man field, and finished 
79th. In the women’s foil, Doris Willette 
of Penn State University took home the 
title, beating out 103 other competitors, 
including two Triton fencers. Senior 
Zitin Kachru ended the tournament 
with a 76th-place finish, while freshman 
Pilar Alicea finished in 84th.

Its biggest hurdle completed, the 
fencing team can now look ahead to 
an upcoming team competition against 
UC Irvine and Cal Tech, which will take 
place at Main Gym on Jan. 31. That 
match will mark the final home date for 
UCSD, after which it will hit the road 
for two meets in February before the 
NCAA West Regional commences on 
March 7.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL—The Tritons 
were outdueled twice last week in 
tough road losses at Cal Baptist 
University and Long Beach State. 
UCSD was handed its first loss on 
Jan. 13 at Cal Baptist in a classic 
back-and-forth grudge match, ulti-
mately falling in five sets — 28-30, 
30-27, 30-32, 30-27 and 20-22. 

On Jan. 16, UCSD walked into 
a difficult matchup with No. 7 
Long Beach State University at the 
Walter Pyramid in Long Beach. The 
Tritons were unable to stay com-
petitive in what was the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation opener for 
both squads, falling to the 49ers in 
three sets — 26-30, 26-30 and 30-32. 
The 49ers were tough to block from 
beginning to end, living up to their 
top-10 ranking.

The Tritons were led by red-
shirt sophomore outside hitter Will 
Ehrman, who had 18 kills on the 
game on .333 hitting. Junior oppo-
site Frank Fritsch added eight kills, 
while sophomore middle blocker 
Calvin Ross and sophomore out-
side hitter Joel Davidson added 
seven kills each. Senior libero Eric 
Leserman also recorded eight digs 
for the Tritons, while redshirt soph-
omore Adrian Guthals managed a 
team-high six blocks to balance out 
his five kills. Bannan recorded 37 
assists overall for the Tritons.

The loss drops UCSD to 1-2, 0-1 
MPSF while the 49ers improve to 2-
2, 1-0 MPSF.

“I thought we competed well with 
Long Beach State,” Leserman said. 
“There was nothing in particular we 
did wrong, one of their players just 
had an amazing game, and he made 
the difference. We have been playing 
well, and if we just play together, we 
will find success. So far, we’ve looked 
strong up and down. Our coach has 
just preached to play our game and 
maintain confidence throughout the 
season.”JIMMY KAN/GUARDIAN
