Sigma Kappa seeks 
eternal friendship

News Edl&or 

Sorority: a term which 
encompasaes social activity at 
collep campuses across the 
US, and wbicb frequently 
involves bigbly emotional 
competition centered around 
parties, loyalty and men. 

Defending th, establishment 
of an intellectual basis for the 
young. UCSD campus" many 
students tum up their noses at 
the thought of resorting to 
sororities as a source of social 
unity on campus. Additionally, 
funding is not available, as it is 
for other student organizations, 
to support sucb groups. 

Sigma Kappa, along with a 
second sorority, began an 
uphill climb to establish 
themselves at UCSD last June. 

With 15 members, they are still 
short the 10 people needed to 
become a chapter. 

Perhaps the most important 
concern of Sigma Kappa 
members is their image. 
Bluntly stated by Lisa DeLuc-
chi, "We're not trying to 
project that we're a bunch of 
hard up girls looking for 
husbands. " 

Eternal friendshiD- is what 
they seek. Jeanne Olivas 
commented that "UCSD is 
lacking concern or compassion 
for anybody. Most people just 
come to school here and then 
they leave. We want something 
to come back to." 

In searching for new mem-
bers, the group has found that

~ Registrar's changeover 
delays class schedules 

A changeover in the way the Registrar's Office keeps track of 
scheduling caused the week-long delay in the release of winter 
quarter class schedules, according to the campus Registrar. 

Ronald Bowker said Monday the winter schedules were held up 
because the changeover to an " on-line terminal" system for 
scheduling was not ready as planned in August. 

Because of this, the Registrar's Office was forced to rely on a 
makeshift system that used elements of both the old, punch card 
method and the new system, Bowker said . 

Campus religious groups can 
" .ow receive ASUCSD funding 

Class schedules 
The class chedules, which are usually available in the seventh 

week of each quarter, were not available this quarter until late 
Monday afternoon. This delay caused the registration process to 
be pushed back until next week and compressed into two days 
instead of the usual four, Bowker said. 

According to Bowker, the new method, when fully installed, is 
designed to facilitate the process of keeping track of class 
schedules, because any changes can be entered directly on the 
computer program through the " on-line" system. 

by Mark Stadler 
Due to what one ASUCSD 

official termed as "chutzpah 
and homework" on the part of 
the ASUCSD, systemwide UC 
administrators have reversed a 
previous ruling concerning 
university fundillj for student 
religious organizations. 

Muir College representative 
Kevin Eckery said Monday that 
UC General Counsel Donald 
Reidhaar has issued a memor-
andum overruling a previous 
directive that said religious 
organizations could not receive 
university funding. 

Budget review 
This means the ASUCSD, 

which in the process of 
rev iewing winter quarter 
budget requests from student 
organizations, will probably 
co ntinue to fund several 
religious groups with campus 
activity fee money. 

Reidhaar's original memo, 
released Aug. 29, ruled out any 
university funding for religious 
orga nizations because this 
would imply that UC was taking 
a position on religion, when it 
wants to remain "neutral" on 
the position, Eckery said. 

Reidhaar's second memo, 
which was received several 
weeks ago, in effect told UC 
officials to ignore the first 
ruling, Eckery said. 

And that directive came as 
the result of efforts taken by an 
ASUCSD task force formed to 
s tudy Reidhaar's memo, 
Eckery said. The task force 
members include President 
Jeff Leifer, student lobby 
annex director Phil Isaac, 
presidential advisor Ralph 
Grunewald and Eckery. 

When Reidhaar issued his 
original memo, it led Assistant 
V ice-chancellor of Student 
Affairs Tom Brown to say 
UCSD has made improper 
funding allocationa to religious 
organization. "since I can 
remember." 

"1IoaIewortl" 
Since that time, ASUCSD 

offlcla .. "did their bomewon 
and went to Reldbaar and 
Browa with ~ from a 

prev,i ous, similar case," 
Eckery said. 

The case the Muir represent-
ative referred to took place 
several years ago, when the UC 
Regents tried to block funding 
for the then-new UC Student 
Lobby. At the time, several 

legal briefs were filed support-
ing funding for the lobby. 

In arguing the case for 
funding religious groups , 
ASUCSD officials used argu-
ments first advanced in defense 
of the lobby's funding, Eckery 
said. 

Committee sees no absence of solutions 

In the past, Bowker said, any scheduling changes involved the 
use of decks of punch cards, which were comparatively 
cumbersome and time-consuming. 

" We apologize for the delay in the release of class schedules, but 
it was really just one of those things," Bowker said. 

'Goal: Ending starvation in two decades 
by Vanessa Griego 

S&aff Writer 
"It can't be done!" is the 

first reaction most people 
give John Kenny, Chairman 
of the San Diego Committee 
for The Hunger Project , 
when he tells them about the 
project 's goal of ending 
starvation on this planet in 
two decades. 

"Most of us think that the 
only reason 20 million of us 
are going to die of starvation 
this year is th~t we lack 
solutions to the problem. It is 
important for us to under-
stand tha t there is no 
absence of solutions to the 
problem of starvation," says 
project literature. 

"There are at least four 
carefully thought-out and 
tested solutions. Already 31

countries have completely 
eradicated death by starva-
tion within their bound-
aries," states a pamphlet 
printed by The Hunger 
Project. 

It goes on to say, "People 
don 't die of hunger because 
there is no solution to the 
problem of hunger. People 
die of hunger because of the 
way the world works - that 
is to say , the forces of the 
world. Hunger is a function 
of the forces in the world, not 
a function of scarcity or a 
function of an absence of 
solutions." 

An idea whose time is here 
"The Hunger Project is 

not a movement or any-
body's good idea, it is not 
about fixing up the prob-
lem," Kenny commented. 
"It is not about solutions. 
The Hunger Project is 
aligning people , coming 
from all possible positions, 
into the context of eliminat-
ing starvation within 20 
years." In the current 
context, starvation is looked 
upon as an acceptable cause 
for death; it is the contention 
of The Hunger Project that it 
is not. Creating the end of 
hunger is an idea whose time 
has come, explained Kenny . 

There are a variety of 
ways in which Project 
participants make them-
selves useful. "Participation 
in the project can take on 
many forms. For each 
individual there is really 
their own leparate project. 
If everyone involved in the 
project were to die, except 

for one person, the project 
would still exist and still be 
working. It is really amazing 
the number of creative 
things people think up to do ," 
said Kenny. 

At present there are about 
three basic ways people can 
participate in the project. 
One is through donations, 
which are tax deductable; 
another . by enrolling new 

people. "People have also 
done such things as donate 
computer space for mailing 
lists, hold haircut-a-thons, 
and one publisher is writing 
a book on a group of 13 year 
olds involved in the project," 
Kenny continued. 

Show biz and experts 
The Hunger Project , 

though it operates on an 
individual level, is also well 
coordinated on a larger 
scale. The project is based in 
San Francisco, with Com-
mittees, such as the one in 
San Diego, operatIDg In 33 
major cities. 

As a whole the project is 
headed by The Hunger 
Project Council , whose 
members currently include 
John Denver ; Valerie 
Harper; Jack Tyler, Presi-
dent of NBC Radio; Roy 
Prosterman, consultant in 
land reform and rural 
development fieldwork in 
Vietnam , Brazil , Israel, 
Japan, Portugal and India; 
and Gregory B. Votaw , 
Director of Country Pro-
,ram. Department, East 
AUa and Pacific Region, 
World Bank. 

The Hunger Project began 
about three years ago. After 
research and discussions 
with authorities such as 
Buckminster Fuller, Roy 
Prosterman and other 
experts on world hunger, the 
project was formally pre-
sented at the February 1977 
meeting of The est Advisory 
Board. The est Foundation 
then provided initial funds 
and was custodian for the 
project while it came into 
existence. 

National recognition 
A lecture series headed by 

Werner Erhard, founder of 
est, in 11 major cities, during 
September and October , 
brought the project to 
people's attention all act 
the country. The series ",S 
well attended throughout tl 
country, with the final 
lecture in Los Angeles, Oct. 
25, drawing 10,000 people 
paying $6 each. Proceeds 
from the lecture went to The 
Hunger Project. 

Kenny stressed, " This is 
not 'an est project. The est 
Foundation was able to 
assist in getting the project 
of( the ground , but The 
Hunger Project is now an 
organization in and of itself 
and is directed towards 
everyone on the planet. Here 
in an Diego we are still 
fUlictioning through the est 
ofnce, telephone system, but 
by next week we will have 
our own number. Anyone

Whatever their poHtical views, surely academic professors know ,lL_--=:~~~~!il!~::""'~ L---""-_-':;:::""";:

• I agree his association witb the dictatorial Chilean government 
certainly is reprehensible and caUous. But their claim that his 
award is a " travesty" bears little relevance to the quality of 
Friedman's work. If professors want to attack a man or his views, 
do so - although hopefully not in a student newspaper. If they 
question the methods of the Nobel selection process, make this 
view explicit. But don't combine the two criticisms and call his 
award a "travesty." 

I, personally, am very much against Friedman's views on socio-
governmental poHcy. But he is most certainly a brilliant advocate 
of laissez·faire, free-market economics. His winning the priie 
acknowledges Friedman's important contributions to his field. 
Certainly the Keynesian school or government involvement in 
economic affairs i. much more useful in determining national 
economic policy in today's world. Buta tborough understanding of 
free-market economics is essential to evolving a creative balance 
between government control and a free-enterprise system. 

Whether the professors who wrote the letter understand this or 
not, their letter would have been more credible had it been signed 
by at least one economics professor. As it is, the letter simply 
demonstrates that these professors are not particularly well-
versed in areas outside their specialty. 

If professors do not wish to lose the respect of their students, 
they should refrain from publishing in student newspapers group 
letters that concern areas outside their rield of specialization. 
Otherwise, their inept understanding will be revealed for all the 
students to see - as was the case in the above-mentioned letter.

No, I am not still plain. You

You are elitist, you are narrow

Can you believe that? 

I don't compare myself to 
you. Life isn't a contest. I have 
my imperfections, too, you 
know. I merely choose my own 
way of living. It's important to 
me to look attractive - blue

to take me anywhere. I have my

A tribute to Triton 
In respect ofthe present debate concerning the proper totem for 

UCSD. I should like to make the following comment: 
The world is too much with us; late and soon, 
Getting and spending, we lay wasJe our powers; 
Little we see in Nature tha t is ours; 
We have given our hearts a way, a sordid boon! 
The Sea that bares her bosom to the moon, 
The winds that will be howling at a ll hours, 
And a re up-gathered now like sleeping flowers , 
For this, for everything, we are out of tune; 
It moves us not. - Grea t God! I'd rather be 
A P agan suckled in a creed outworn; 
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, 
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn; 
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea; 
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.

it's an ,advantage to belong to

Sigma Kappa has adopted a

Idealrock'n'roll 

Sex pistols will 
'never "mellow" 

by Mikel Toombs 
Never Mind die Bollocks. Here's the Sex Pistols - The Sex Pistols 

(Warner Brothers). 
Rock 'n' roll is much more an attitude than a form of musical 

expression, a fact invariably ignored by anti-rock critics, as well as 
by a surprising number of rock fans. The great rock 'n' roll figures of 
the past - such as Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the 
Stones - achieved their initial success not by being musically 
innovative, but by possessing the right attitude: they flaunted the 
conventions of the time, portraying" rebels without a cause" to their 
lartely-teena,e audience. The means they chose to mock authority 
were numerous, but their major weapon always seemed to be sex . 

The Sex Pistola are a ,reat rock 'n' roll band, but paradoxically 
they aren't concerned with sex. They are after much bigger ,arne, as . 
they indicated on their first English single, "Anarchy in the U.K." 
With lines like-"I don't know what! want but! know how to gelit" and 
"I wanna be anarchistll'm gettin' pissed/Destroy," the song is a 
blatant challenge to the powers-that-be in England today. Aimed at 
an audience of worldng class youth, upwards of 50 percent of whom 
are unemployed and living off the "dole," it established a violent and 
pessimistic tone that continues in the Sex Pistols' later work. The 
group's advocacy of anarchy was short-lived - their personal 
experiences with violent reaction saw to that- but the assertion that 
"I don't know what! want" is borne out by their subsequent material. 
And while trying to figure out exactly what they wanted, they 
uncovered a lot of things that they definitely didn't want. 

"God Save the Queen" and " Holidays in the Sun" (their second and 
fourth U.K. singles) are excellent political protest songs. " God Save 
the Queen" is the Sex Pistols' masterpiece so far, a number one hit 
without the benefit of any radio airplay. The song brilliantly 
undercuts the pompous ceremonies of the Queen's Silver Jubilee 
celebration ("because tourists are money") with an understanding 
of the true economic conditions in the country, driving the message 
home to their audience with a powerful ,"no Cuture, no future, no 
future for you" chorus . " Holidays in the Sun" points up the group's 
ideological uncertainty , making confusing references to 
communism and the Berlin Wall, but it is nonetheless an effective 
call for increased social awareness. 

When they aren 't taking out their anger On socioeconomic 
conditions, the Sex Pistols are getting mad at other people <as on 
" Liar" and " Problems"), at their first record company <the 
outstanding "EMI" ) and most intriguingly, at themselves. "No 
Feelings" is a vicious self-portrait of someone in love with himseIC 
and with " no feeling for anybody else." The song probably isrr't 
meant to be autobiographical , but it is still disturbing. "Pretty 
Vacant" (their third single) is even stranger - it accepts what critics 
of the Sex Pistols put them down for and turns that criticism into a 
potent personal anthem. The group quite proudly proclaims "We're 
pretty vacant and we don't care" - they're confused "rebels without 
a cause" and not in the least ashamed of it or afraid to admit it. 

The Sex Pistols play music that is basic, inte se, wild and yet 
somewhat controlled - the ideal rock 'n' roll band. Drummer Paul 
Cook highlights his work with plenty of clashing cymbals, and Steve 
Jones provides simple but excellent guitar fills that have been 
borrowed (rom just about everyone. (The main riff for " Holidays in 
the Sun" was appropriated from the Jam's " In the City" - a title that 
had been taken from a line in " Anarchy in the U.K.") The Sex Pistols 
switched bass players in the process oC making the album - Sid 
Vicious replaced Glenn Matlock - and the rumor was that the 
change was made because Matlock was too good Cor the band. 

The focal point of the Sex Pistols is unquestionably singer Johnny 
Rotten. His snarling vocals, more shouted than sung, are the perfect 
compliment to the uncompromising nature of the songs. Rotten is the 
group's yongest and least experienced member, and his anger on 
songs like "God Save the Queen" and "EMI" comes across as very 
real - and when he sings " We'r • so pretty/We're so pretty/Pretty 
vacant" he is completely believable. Even as the Sex Pistols become 
more accomplished musicians and perhaps "slicker, " Rotten's 
attitude is unaffected - and as a result the entire group's integrity 
remains intact.

Harriers 6th In district; 
Jacobson to Nationals 

Two Triton cross country runners finished in the top fifteen spots 
at last Saturday's NAIA Dist rict Three Championships in LA . 
Mirada, qualifying them for the NAIA Nationals this weekend. 
Overall, UCSD finished sixth in the 12 team meet, which was won 
handily by Point Lorna College. 

Doug Jacobson's time oU&: 55 over the five mile course put him 
in twelfth place and Tom Grimm's 27: 03 gave him fifteenth place. 
HoUl runners earned berths in the NAIA National Championships 
this Saturday at the University of Wisconsin, Parkside in Kenosha, 
but coach Andy Skeif said only Jacobson will run in the Nationals 
because of a better overall performance during the season. 

UCSD had runners finish 12th, 15th, 28th (Alan Bernath 28: 20) , 
30th (Peter Dolan 28: 23), 61st (Bill Sullivan 31: 33) and 62nd 
(Rubin Gonzales 31: 41) ; totaling 146 points, behind Point Loma's 
40, Westmont II, Claremont 90, Cal Lutheran 96 and Fresno 
Pacific 106. 

Skeif noted the absence of Jon Halperin, who ran in the Canadian 
Nationals for tbe University of Toronto, and the subpar 
performance of Dolan ruined a poss~ble fifth place team finish for 
UCSD. Dolan's time of 28: 23, his slowest of the season, was due to, 
as Skeif pointed out, •• a va'riety of factors . He wasn't feeling well at 
all . There might have been some lack ot commUDlcauon oetween 
the type of workouts I had planned for him and what Reter actually 
ran ... He peaked early in the season, but I can't put a finger on 
exactly wby he didn't run well. He just wasn't ready. "
