Atkinson says engineering 
school possible at UCSD 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
Associate New8 Editor 

·Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson yesterday announ· 
ced plans to investigate the 
possibility of establishing a 
chool of engineering on this 

campus. 
"I plan to ask the faculty to 

examine the issue of whether 
we should have a school of 
engineering at UCSD," 
Atkinson said at this year's 
first Board of Overseers 
meeting. 

The possibility of est~bli· 
shing a" school of engineering 
here was one of a number of 
issues Atkinson presented to 
over 30 board members who 
attended the meeting. 

The Board of Overseers, 
composed mostly of promi· 

nent community members 
and UCSD administrators , 
was formed by former 
Chancellor William McElroy 
during his term here. Its 
purpose is to promote 
communication between 
UCSD and the San Diego 
community, and to provide 
advice to the chancellor on 
the operation of the campus 
and its role in the 
community. 

Atkinson suggested that a 
school of engineering could be 
"a big drawing card" for 
UCSD and asked the Board to 
"examine the proposal from 
the community viewpoint, to 
see if it is wise for UCSD to 
move in that direction." 

"We have all the compo-
nents for a school of 
engineering here already," 

Atkinson told the Board. "We 
have remarkably strong 
computer science and 
electrical engineering 
programs here now, and 
there is increasingly strong 
pressure from student who 
want to enter schools of 
engineering." 

After the meeting, the 
Chancellor emphasized to 
reporters that the possiblity 
of a UCSD school of 
engineering is "not as 
proposal, just an issue to be 
examined by the faculty. 
Ther is a severe shortage of 
engineering schools in this 
country. The question is, 
would establishing one here 
make sense." he said.

AS Council seeks to eliminate 
Wood<m¥s advisor position 

BY DEAN HAAS 
The Associated Students 

debated a proposal calling for 
elimination of Randy 
Woodard's AS Advisor 
positiQn at last night's 
councl1 meeting , before 
moving to send the bill to the 
Rules Committee for further 
examination. 

The resolution, submitted 
by Warren College represen· 
tative to the AS Marsha 
Vdovin, states that AS "does 
not need to he monitored by 
the administration" and 
labels UCSD student 
government "a puppet of the 
administration." The 
proposal recommends that 
funds allocated to pay the 
advisor be put to other use. 

Funds for the advisor's 
position are supplied by 
student registration fees and 
not AS activity fees, the only 
monies over which the AS 
Council has control. 

Several council members 
voiced strong opposition to 
the proposal, which Vdovin 

claims is "not a personal 
attack on Randy." 

"In my opinion, the job 
. Randy has done is very 

credible," said AS President 
Bill Topkis. "He has been a 
great help to me ... He is the 
type of advisor that you feel 
comfortable with." 

Pam Gerber, Muir College 
AS representative, reminded 
the council that "We're 
elected to represent students 
in allocating activity fee 
funds. We are not here for 
hiring and firing." 

Reg Fee Committee 
Chairwoman Cathy Valerio 
told the Council "If vou ask

lows will be in the high 50s.

degrees with swells of four to 
five feet every ten ('~onds. 

for Randy's position to be 
eliminated (you're) asking for 
the Reg Fee Committee to 
take money away from the 
AS." 

Woddard 's response to the 
proposal was mixed. He told 
the Council he was at first 
"hurt" when he heard of. 
Vdovin's resolution but "had 
been expecting it for some 
time," due to conversations 
he'd had with Vdovin in the 
past. 

Woddard also said he 
would support the Council's 
decision on the fate of his 
position, but added that 
"there will always be 
someone there to oversee 
student government." 

The resolution will come 
before the Council next week 
for action on the Rules 
Committee's recommenda· 
tion.

night, the Council :

office aid. 

"There will be orne

Collum added. 

Atkinson aid the meeting 
produced "general agreement 
that there hould be good 
notice before an area is 
cleared by police," and that 
"there is reason to believe 
that the warning (Wednes-
day night) wa not adequate. 

"The thing that bothers 
me is the potential to hurt 
someone. We want to 
establi h clarity on how to 
deal with thi ," Atkin on 
aid. 

Campus police chief Hugh 
French ended his silence on 
the su bject yesterday. 

He aid that the demon· 
straors were a ked to leave 
ju t prior to their removal, 
but aid he couldn't 
remem.ber how long it wa 
before police moved in to 
forcibly remove the demon· 
strators. 

"It could have been 
minutes or seconds," French 
said. 

The police chief said he 
received complaints from 
administrators inside the 
reception that the protestors 
were too noisy, making 
conversation difficult. 

He refu ed to say who 
complained or how many 
comolain t<; hp. rprpived. 

Demon trator Mitch So na 
aid tudent were forming 

committee to look into- the 
po ibilit y of uing the 
campu police, but ob erver 
aid their chance of winning 

such a uit were "nil. " 
Wheeler s aid council 

member were "outraged" by 
the incident, and the council 
last night di cus ed the 
po sibility of pur uing legal 
action again t campus PQlice. 
The AS cannot seek help 
fro campus legal services 
however, as that program is 
supported by university 
funds and cannot be used 
against another university 
body, campus police. 

Student Body Presidents 
Council Chairwoman Linda 
Sabo, present at the meeting, 
suggested the demonstrators 
coUld seek help from SBPC 
attorneys. The Council plans 
to investigate this possibility 
and other alternatives before 
next week's AS meeting. 

One council member, who 
asked not to be identified, 
said the threat of a suit 
against campu police is 
"more for a nuisance value 
than anything else. They're 
just trying to let the police 
know that we notice when 
they do outrageous things 
like that." 

The task force will be 
small, the chancellor's office 
said.

. Screwing the Selective Service in Lenox, Mass. 

BY KEN WEISS 
This past summer's draft 

registration occurred at a peculiar 
time for me. While many of my friends 
were in smO(lKY Los Angeles, sunny La 
Jolla, or traipsing about Europe, I was 
in the Massachusetts Birkshires 
taking 1l·16·year·old boys on 
backpack trips. 

One quarter mile down the road 
from Tanglewood, the summer home 
of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, 
and situated on the picturesque ' 
Stockridge Bowl, Camp Mah-Kee·Nac 
has everything a boy could ask for -
there is even a girl s fine arts camp 
across the lake. 

One humid late July day, three 
tennis counselors and I took some 
afternoon time off, hitched a ride into 
Lenox with the camp director and 
walked into the Lenox Post Office to 
register for the draft . . 

We called ourselves the 63rd Mah· 
Kee·Nac squadron, ready and able to 
defend whatever it is we were meant 
to defend. We were sheltered yet wild 
in our rural eastern camp niche, 
completey isolated from society except 
for an occasional New York TimlS, 
fuzzy rock and roll from Pittsfield's 
WUPE (Whoopee) radio, and of course 
spurratic glimpses of Wimbledon and 
the .AlI·Star game. 

Urban and national realities rarely 
touched our lives at Mah-Kee-Nac, 
except (or that afternoon in the post 
office. 

Mike, Mark, Alan and I marched 
into the post office and asked for the 
green and white Selective Service 
form, which requests basic 
information about every male born in 
1960 and 1961. We had been joking 
about the draft for quite a few weeks, 
telling ourselves, "Oh, it won't 
happen to me. And if it does, well ..... so 
there we were, allowing ourselves to 
become ten-digit numbers with two 
hyphens. 

Except me. 
I had toyed with the idea of 

resistance, but my mom and draft 
counselor both advocated using soft 
revolution techniques, working 
within the system to attain exemption 
from military service. Nevertheless, I 
enpged myself in some heavy soul· 

Ka WtW is a" u"tkrgradlUlU 
slN"'l i" communicatiom. 

searching and arrived at the 
conclusion that I am a Conscientious 
Objector. 

I then placed numerous phone calls 
to the Central Committee for 
Conscientious Objectors (CCCO) in 
New York City and to the Jewish 
Peace Fellowship in Los Angeles for 
more information. Being a not-so-rich 
college student, [ charged the calls to 
my mom's phone. 

Supplied with instructions on how 

.. 

to fill out the registration form, I 
proceeded to fill in my name, 
birthdate, sex, permanent (and 
mailing) address and the day's .date. 
Claiming falsification paranOia, I 
crossed out those sections requesting 
my social security and telephone 
numbers, and box number 8! labeled, 
"Check here if we may gIVe your 
name, address and telephone ~um~ 
to Armed Forces recrUIters . 
Especially box number 8. 

I also did not sign the form. After 
writing my own anti·war statement 
on both sides of the five· by eight·inch 
card, I looked around for a xerox 
machine to record my disfiguration . 
There was one next to the PO boxes 
with a piece of paper on it. 

"Out of order." 
Great. I already knew that the only 

other xerox machine in Lenox, 
population 5,000, was also 
convalescing down the street in the 
library. I did not panic, though, since 
today was Monday and I had until 
Friday to register. 

"When is four xerox machine going 
to be fixed?' I asked Mr. Postman. 

"Within a week, maybe." 

I had heard the same response at the 
library earlier. So, feeling a bit lost 
and conspired against, I stuffed the 
green and white form in my pocket 
and joined the other three Mah-Kee· 
Nac 63rd squadron members in the 
parking lot. They had patiently 
waited for me to finish scribbling, and 
made references to escapism after I 
told them what I was trying to do. I 
enlightened them on the importance 
of documentation for Conscien· 

tious Objection file and sulked. After 
all, I did not want to inadvertailtly 
resist, but I needed copies of my 

~stration form for my CO file. 
Returning by bicydeon Thursday, I 

was relieved to find the post office's 
xerox machine in working order. An 
old woman was feeding the machine 
dimes, so I fed her with some college 
charm and waited for her to finish. 
She, as everyone else I met in the 
Birkshires, was very polite and 
receptive to conversation with 
strangers. 

After depositing 40 cents into the 
copier, I looked down at my inked 
masterpiece one last time to make 
sure everything was in order. I walked 
over to the counter, relieved that 
finally I was able to xerox the form, 
and handed the completed version 
(now mostly blue rather than green 
and white) to a postmaster. 

He was as big around as he was tall. 
He wore small glasses, had a double 
chin, locks of grey hairs scattered on 
his bald head, and looked as if he had 
founded the Lenox branch Post Office 
quite a while ago. He accepted my 
f<rm, stared down at it. and glanced at 

another, younger postmaster. I looked 
up, smiling. 

"What's this mess?" he asked me. 
"It's my registration form ," I 

responded politely. 
"You don't have a social security 

number?" he queried. 
"Uh, no, not yet ." 
"Telephone number?" he pursued. 
·'No." 
"You don 't want to sign it either?" 

he asked as if he had anticipated this 
situation would happen in Lenox 
eventually. 

"No, I don't ." 
"You have some ID?" 
I carefully produced my .drivers 

license without revealing any other 
parts of my wallet. 

"Okay." He tossed the card onto a 
pile and shook his head at the other 
postmaster as I left, chuckling to 
myself. 

Camp progressed well and end~ too 
soon for many of us. I was ttlad to-start 
traveling after nine.weeks ofcamplif.e 
ana enjoyed sPendlng i few weeks 
seeing fnends arui relatives in Ne.w 
Eland. -. " .. ~iving home in Los Angeles after 
three months on the east coast, I 

-eagerly sl.fted fhrough the 
accumulation of mail on my desk and 
spotted a . letter from the Selective 
Service: I. was notified that my 
registration form had been processed 
but was incomplete because I had 
faiied to provide my social security 
and telephone !,umber:s._ 

Advised ~ the form letter that I 
could be suDject to a $10,000 fine and 
five years impri~ment for violation 
of Selective service regulations , I 
immediately phoned my draft 
counselor fot advice. We talked for 
awhile and decided that since the 
Selective Service could acquire this 
information from any number of 
sources, I should use the response 
form to my advantage. 

So, remmiscent of that late July in 
Lenox, I dutif~l1y filled in the required 
information and wrote on both sides of 
the form another, more extensive, 
anti·war statement. But instead of 
handing in the form over a counter, I 
mailed it to ~he Selective Service in 
North Chiclfio, Illinois. 

I can just see them opening my 
response and then looking at each 
other. " 

"What's tl1is mess?"

NEWS BRIEFS 

Anderson foregoes 
loan efforts for ads 

MILWAUKEE-JohnB. 
Anderson, his approval 
rating in public opinion polls 
sinking, said yesterday he 
ha abandoned efforts to 
botrow millions of dollar 
from banks to finance a late· 
hour television advertising 
blitz for his independent 
presidential campaign. 

Instead , Anderson said, he 
will rely on small loans from 
individual su pporters to 
finance the first of his 
television ads beginning 
Sunday. 

In a Milwaukee television 
interview, Anderson said the 
banks he had been negotia · 
ting with in New York and 
Chicago were intimidated by 
hints from President Carter's 
campaign aides that such 
loans may be illegal. 

Anderson said there would 
have been nothing wrong 
with the banks making the 
10il-ns. "Nevertheless," he 
said, "banks are a regulated 
industry and understandably 
might feel a little skittish on 
making loans. 

"The banks are out of the 
picture," Anderson said . 

Campaign aides said that 
as of yesterday, a little more 
than $1 million had been 
raised by appealing to about 
200,000 previous contribu· 
tors to Anderson 's campaign. 

They aid the campaign

'-Death Walk' tour of 
cant pus sparsely attended 

Pro ressive Coalition protests research 
BY PETER MORTENSEN 

New. Editor 
Citing UCSD's research 

into "germ warfare, sleep 
loss performance, intentional 
inducement of heart 
attacks," and "other things 
that kill people," the 
Progressive Coalition led a 
"Death Walk" tour around 
campus yesterday. 

Although about 50 
onlookers listened on the 
Revelle Plaza to coalition 
leaders make introductory 
remarks, only 15 students 
followed the procession that 
passed through the School of 
Medicine and Warren, Third 
and Muir Colleges. 

Before the walk, coalition 
member Barry Hyman told 
the crowd on the plaza that 
he and others are "abhorred, 
shocked and dismayed" by 
the amount of military 
research that allegedly takes 
place at UCSD. 

Although the tour was 
designed to cover outside 
locations on campus, the 
group did attempt to enter 
the Office of Contracts and 

Grant on Warren·campus. 
The office was closed for 

lunch, and coalition leaders 
settled for pointing through 
windows at file cabinets they 
claimed contain contracts 
between the university and 
organizations involved in 
biological warfare, weapons 
development and ' foreign 
political subversity. 

In all, 32 professors and 
staff members were cited as 
having some ties to military 
research . 

"We have to persuade them 
(the professors) not to do this 
kind of research," Hyman 
said, adding that he hopes the 
coalition can persuade 
secretaries and staff who 
work with the scientists to 
stop their work as well. 

"We must shut down the 
university laboratories," he 
said in his concluding 
remarks, drawing applau e 
from the spar e crowd. 

Another coalition member, 
George Mathias, told the 

group how University of 
Michigan student had 
protested against alleged 
military research on that 
campus. "One morning, all of 
the scientists found their 
doors sealed with Crazy 
Glue," he said. 

Mathias then read the 
names and room numbers of 
Revelle College professors 
who he said are connected 
wi th the quest ionable 
research. "Maybe you could 
glve them a present or 
something," he suggested. 

The Progressive Coalition 
said that they compiled their 
information by searching 
through public documents on 
file in the Office of Contracts 
and Grants. "It took many 
hour this summer to get this 
information," Hyma.n said. 

Some documents, e pecial· 
Iy in the biology department, 
were not available in time for 
the Death Walk, but coalition 
member aid they will 
publish more information as 
soon as it is available.

The Finance Committee re-
quested that Harris submit 
his proposal in line-item form , 
specifically detailing the 
amounts of money needed for 
each event. Harris told the 
Council that this type of account-
ing was " not feasible" for

his desire for more control 
over his budget. .

Overseers hear 
Chancellor's plans 
(;onli nllcd frolll page 1 
penings at UCSD, including a 
report on the status of the 
UCSD Theater, and an · 
nouncements on the US-
Mexical1 Studies Program's 
recent campus formation, on 
the resignatinos of vice· 
chancellors Richard Armi-
tage and lohn Moxley and a 
report on the planned 
pu r ch ase of U ni versity 
Hospital, Atkinsol) voiced 
issues of particular impor-
tance to him. 

"r would like to see a 
different approach to 
construction on campus," 
said Atkinson , explaining 
that the University spends 
over $1 million in rent to 
house research faci li ties off 
campus. 

"It' s foolish for us not to 
house these facilities on 
campus. With research 
program located off campus, 
students don't have ties with 
that aspect of the universi-
ty," Atkinson said, adding 
that he hopes to explore 
alternative fu nding sources, 
other than state and federal 
aid , to make on-campus 
construction possible. 

Atkinson also expressed 
interest in obtaining "an 
overview of how s tate and 
local politics influence the 
university. I would like a 
committee to examine that 
area," he said. 

UCSD ·San Diego com · 
munity relations was a final 
concern Atkinson voiced. 

"This is not an urgent 
topic, but I think the San 
Diego community needs to 
think about what role UCSD 
should play .. .. what sort of 
interaction should take place 
between the university and 

the community," the 
Chancellor aid . 
The Board pent the majority 
of its meeting discu sing 
plans to better define its 

' purpo e and jurisdiction . 
Atkinson indicated earlier 
this year, though, that he 
might choose to dissolve the 
board. 

The discussion centered 
around the new Board of 
Qverseers Guidelines , 
recent ly drawn up by 
Secretary to the Board David 
Ernst. The guidelines came 
partly as a result of 
Atkinson 's desire to 
"formalize the board and its 
activities. " 

" [n the past, the Board has 
been experimental," Atkin· 
son told the members . . "I 
believe that if it's going to be 
effective, then the Board's 
activities must be for· 
malized ." 

Included in the guidelines, 
which must be approved by 
the Board at its next meeting 
on Dec. 4, are stipulations on 
the number and compo ition 
of the board , its purpose and 
the term of office for Board 
members. 

Most Board members were 
favorable to the guidelines, 
although they debated 
strongly over their goals and 
re pons ibilitie . 

"The purpose of this 
Board, as I understand it, is 
to ass ist and advise the 
Chancellor," said member 
Milton Friedman, a local 
attorney. 

Atkinson acknowledged 
that the Board does indeed 
servethatpurpose,butthatit 
"should have a certain degree 
of independence to be most 
effective." 

Grants available 
for academic projects 

The ·UC President's 
Advisory Committee on the 
Intercampus Activity Fund 
announced yesterday that 
they have about $800,000 to 
fund academic projects in 
which one or more campuses 
are involved. 

According to Andrew 
Black, a former UCSD 
student now with the UCLA· 
based committee, the 
requi rements for project 
funding are few and simple. 

To be considered for a 
grant, a project must involve 
students from more than one 
UC campus, have admini· 
stratlve approval from each 
campus and have a specified 
budget. ' 

Tfi~ committee will not 
fund budget items for 
equipment "seed money" for 

resea rch, and will not 
authorize computer time 
unless it is directly related to 
an academic project. 

Black says the committee 
was formed by UC President 
David Saxon to increase 
academ ic interactio n 
betw een the nine UC 
campuses. 

About $1 million was 
allotted for the committee 
last year, but only a quarter 
of that was used . The rest 
has been carried over to fund 
this year's projects , Black 
says. 

Administrative approval 
and budget outlines shou Id be 
sent to Black at 308 
Westwood Plaza , 304 
Kerckoff Hall , Los Angeles, 
CA 90034. 

Hostage exchange detlied 
WASHINGTON - The 

State Department ' denied 
yesterday a report on a 
Chicago television station 
that military planes were 
ready to leave for Iran by 
Friday with spare fighter 
parts to trade for the 
American hostages. 

Quoting "exclusive 
sources" here, WLS-TV, the 
ABC affiliate in Chicago, said 
a deal is in the works for the 
hostage , release, perhaps as 
soon as the end of the week. 

State Department officials, 

asking not to be named, 
denied the report. A White 
House official, also request· 
ing anonymity, said l "There is nothing to report. ' 

At the Pentagon, spokes· 
man Thomas Ross also 
denied the story, saying "the 
report involving aircraft 
loaded with spare parts is 
false." WLS-TV said five 
planes carrying parts were to 
leave Chicago no later than 
noon Friday for Iran and that 
pilots in the Chicago area 
were on 48-hour standby.

CODlDlunications head supports progratn 
Cole concedes that switch to department is (extremely unlikely' 

BY MARTI WARD 
Creating a separate 

department for communica-
tions at UCSD has been the 
subject of some controversy 
ince its inception as a 

program_ In spiteof efforts on 
the part of some faculty 
members and students, 
though, this change will 
probably not take place and 
may not be necessary, 
according to Program Head 
Michael Cole_ 

Cole calls such a restruc- . 
ting "extremely unlikely .in 
the short run" and says there 

are no concrete plans to make 
it happen in the long run. 

A program, unlike a 
department, does not have 
the option of hiring and firing 
personnel. Faculty members 
teaching communications 
must be hired through some 
other department such as 
psychology, political science 
or literature. 

According to Cole, this has 
caused some bad feelings ovr 
the years and put communi-
cations in a position where 
they did not have control over 
their curriculum. 

"There weren't enough 
well trained faculty to teach 
in the curriculum and there 
was a large number of 
students that wanted to take 
it," Cole says. "So those who 
favor departmental status 
are really saying that they 
favor first class treatment of 
communications on a par 
with other academic units , 
like sociology, or psychology 
or literature or anything 
else_" 

Cole would like to see 
Communications work -
properly as an interdiscipli· 

nary program. "A program 
that really operated ' in the 
spirit that a program should 
is ideal for communications," 
he ay. 

"Communication i what 
makes socia l phenomena 
possible so it's a great 
vantage point from which to 
study social sciences," he 
says. HI think we do have a 

pret~r effective program 
now. 

He admits the program, still 
contains some weaknesses. 
"Communications doesn't 
have a particularly strong

faculty ," he says. 
"We have faculty currently 

who are appointed in Visual 
Art , Psychology. Sociology, 
Political Science. We have a 
temporary position in 
linguistics. We have good 
relations with Literature. 

We are recruiting together 
with a variety of depart· 
ments, trying to fill out our 
faculty. Our problem is we 
have lots and lots of n1ajors 
and not enough faculty ,' he 
explains. 

"I think we have a eally 
solid major now," affirms 
Cole. "Our problem is to get 

- solid instructors to teach the 
courses that are the core of 
the major. We need a few 
more faculty members. It's a 
problem because there aren't 
very many open positions on 
the campus." 

Since the hiring is up to 
the social science depart-
ment, cooperation between 
the program and them is 
necessary if a strong 
Communications personnel 
is to be had, Cole feels. 
"Departments have their 
own demands on them," 
points out Cole, "so can they 
find their way clear to 
cooperate with us? The 
answer by and large has been 
'yes'. I'm just happy that we 
have a number of depart· 
ments that are happy to 
cooperate with us."

the term means? 

We might disagree about 
conclusions less than' it 
seems, given this letter. But 
Mr. Williams and I are at 
opposite poles when it comes 
to the value of deductive 
reasoning. 

In that arena, Mr. 
Hamilton is quite a bit more 
simi lar to Stalin than 
Kennedy eyer· was.

Nuclear weapons 
UVERMORE - The 

deadliest weapons on earth 
are developed at a secret 
laboratory in a valley criss-
crossed with more than a 
dozen earthquake faults, just 
40 miles from San Francisco. 

Critics say quakes could 
damage Lawrence Livennore 
National Laboratory - a 
center for nuclear weapons 
research - and release 
deadly plutoium in an area 
where more than 5 million 
people live. 

Lab officials insist that the 
facility would survive the 

quake wit hough releasing 
any radioactivity. 

"If you wiped out a nuclear 
power plant, the risk would 
be much, much greater than 
it would at one of our 
facilities, " said Frank 
Tokarz, a structural engineer 
and reactor safety expert at 
the lab. 

Lab seismologist James 
Scheimer is preparing an 
environmental impa c t 
statement for the lab. He 
agreed that Building 332, the 
plutonium contail1'1TIent 
facility , could withstand any 

likely quake. 
But one lab scientist, who 

asked not to be identified, 
said "We go fried - a public 
hearing on an earlier 
environmental impact 
statement that was flung 
together. " 

In January, a pair of 
earthquakes caused signifi-
cant damage to Building 332, 
according to the lab. But the 
damage was not in the part of 
the building that holds the 
plutonium, the report sai. It 
was concluded there was no 
danger of re le a se of

plutonium. 
Elyse Axe)) , spokeswo(uan 

for the activist Friends of the 
Earth, said, "Our bottom line 
is that the plant should be 
moved out. The earth~uake 
hazards are too high.' Lab 
spokesman Jeff Garberson 
called that a minority view. 

The controversy is one of 
many that surround the 
LIvermore lab , sister 
operation to Los Alamos, 
located on a remote hilltop in 
sparsely populated New 
Mexico. Both are operated by 
the University of California. 

But Livennore's proximity 
to San Francisco has made it 
a target for anti-nuclear 
protestors, peace activists 
and environmentalists. 

Thursday, October 16, 1980 

More than half of 
Livermore's current $420 
million budget is devoted to 
nuclear weapons and other 
defense-related items. Most 
of the rest goes for energy 
research, as outgrowth of 
weapons development. 

The issue of earthquake 
safety at the lab, founded in 
1952 on the site of a World 
War II Navy training base, 
has been raised mostly by 
outsiders. But the lab also 
has been the scene of internal 
debates. One concerns how 
much money should be spent 
on advan ced weapon s 
development, what the lab 
describes as a nur ery for 
s prouting the ideas of 
tomorrow.
