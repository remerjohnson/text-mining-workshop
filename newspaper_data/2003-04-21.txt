BRIEFLY 
SARS breakout sends EAP 

students in Asia home 
The University of California's 

Education Abroad Programs In Beijing 
will be suspended due to the expansion of 

evere cute Respiratory yndrome, and 
the 44 students currently participating in 
tho e programs have been instructed to 
return Immediately. 

The decision reflects the University 
of California's ongoing concern for stu-
dent safety, given the spread of SARS in 
Beijing, including a recently confirmed 
case at Peking University and other cases 
in neighborhoods near the university. 

No EAP students have been diag-
nosed with SARS. 

To ensure the swift return ofUC stu-
dents still in China, EAP i supporting 
students with travel plans, helping elim-
inate financial obstacles due to the pro-
gram suspension, securing as much aca-
demic credit as possible for students and 
advising precautions for students on 
health care upon their return . 

EAP continues to monitor local con-
ditions that may impact its programs in 
Hong Kong . Singapore, Taiwan and 
Viemam. At tillS time, all other EAP pro-
grams currently operating in Asia remain 
open . 

EAP will decide no later than May 
10 about operating its summer pro-
grams in Beijing. Summer programs in 
Beijing are scheduled to begin in late 
June. 

Bright light exposure

The levels of a pituitary hormone 
that Increase testosterone are enhanced 
after exposure to bright hght in the early

of men had their LH measured again 
after exposure to a placebo light from 5 
a.m. to 6 a. m. for five days. 

The researchers found that LH levels 
~ere increased.69.5 percent after bright 
hght exposure III the early morning. 

Previous studies have shown that 
bright light exposure helps alleviate the 
symptoms of depression. 

According to the study's authors, sex-
ual dysfunction, such as loss of libido and 
decreased sexual activity, which are 
known depres ion symptoms, as well as 
ide effects of newly developed antide-

pressants, may be helped by bright light 
exposure. 

The study is published in the current

Council backs fee legislation 
Bill would mandate student input 
By CLAYTON WORFOLK 

Senior Staff Writer 

The .S. Counci l has shown 
its support for a new piece of state 
legis lation that would give 
Uni versity of California, 
Cali forni, tate University and 
California community coll ege 
students direct input in affecting 

~ystem-wide resident student fec 
Increase. 

On April 16. the Cou nci l 
unanllnously passed a resolution 
in support of Assembly Bill 550, 
the Student Fee ffordability Act, 
which would require the UC 
Regents, the Trustees of the CSU 
and tile community college sys-
tem to gain approval fr0111 
Student Fee Advisory 
Committees before enacting fee 
increases. 

A.B. 550, which was iJ1lro-
duced by Assemblyman Manny 
Diaz (D-San Jose) in February, 
would create an advisory commit-
tee wi thin each state school gov-
erning body. Each II -member 
advisory committee would be 
composed of six tudents. two fac-
ulty members, two members of 
the administration and a r:1ember 
of the Parent-t eacher 
Association. All positions would 
be appointed by the governor. 

"[A.B. 550] goes across cvery 
student in California," sa id A.S. 
Vice President External tephcn 
Klas . "It mandates that those stu-
dents have a say whcnever fees are 
going to be raJscd ." 

Klass, who al 0 c hairs the 
Uni\'ersity of California Student 
Association Board of Directors, 

said that the bill would promotc 
student involvement in the 
"sharcd governance" of thc UC, 
CSU and community college sys-

tem~. The A.S. resolution sta tes 
that the UC currently "operatcs 
under a shared governance 
between the Board of Regents and 
the Senate of Faculty with 110 
equally represcntative body for 
the students." 

The UCSA, California tate 
Student Association and the 
California Studcnt Association of 
Community Colleges worked 

" [A .B. 550 would] eUmi, 
nate student fees coming 
up as a solution to mid, 
year budget problems . " 

- Steve Klass, 
A.S_ \/ice President Extemal 

with Diaz in the drafting of A.B. 
550. 

The bill would also require the 
governing bodies to develop a 
"methodology" for adjusting stu-
dent fces and provide the gover-
nor, Legislature and the 
California Postsecondary 
Edllcationary Committee with an 
annual report of its methodology'S 
impact on students. 

"[A. B. 550] mandates that all 
other options be exhausted before 
thcy look at s tudent fees," Klass 
said. "[Tt saysJ that student fee 

[increases] shou ld be something 
that governing board~ don't 
want." 

A.B. 550 comes on ly months 
after substantial midterm fee 
hikes in the UC and CSU sys-
tems. [nJ anuary, Gov. G ray Davis 
propos cd additional student fee 
increases WIth his 2003-04 budget 
proposal. 

The mid-year fee increases 
drew criticism from many stu-
dents who felt they were not given 
enough prior notification of the 
increa e . Many also fe lt they were 
not given a chance to provide 
input on the fee increase before it 
was enacted. 

A.B. 550 sets a timeline for 
student fee changes that would 
require governing bodies to act 
upon proposed changes no later 
than ov. 30 If they are to take 
effect the foll owing academic 
year. 

According to the bill, "this 
advance notification will enable 
students and their families to bet-
ter plan financially." 

"[A.B. 550 wouldJ eliminate 
student fees coming up as a solu-
tion to mid-year budget prob-
lems," Klass said. 

The ASUCSD will send its res-
olution to Chancellor Robert e. 
Dynes, UC President Richard e. 
Atkinson, the UC Board of 
Regents, Gov. Gray Davis, 
Lieutenant Governor Cruz 
Bustamante and two local legisla-
ture members, according to the 
resolution. 

A.B . 550 will be addressed by 
the State Committee on Il igher 
Education on April 22 .

Warren College's 
president-elect DQ'd 
WCTV campaigning found 
to be in violation of bylaws 

By STEVEN WITT 
Staff Writer 

Electi on con trover y continued 
on April 18 when Warren College 
Stude nt ouncil president-elect 
Daniel Wans was di qualified from 
the 2003 elections by the Earl 
Warren College JudiCIal Board for 
violati ng election bylaws. 

Warren student Crystal 
Kitamura filed a grievance against 
Wans after she VIewed Watts cam-
paigning on his Warren College 
Television show "Perfect Vision." 
She argued at the April 16 hearing 
that Watts' campaigning on 
WCTV violated article IV. section 
B.2 .j of the Warren College 
Election bylaws, in which it states 
that "no candidate shall use Warren 
College offices, services, enterprIS-
es or equipment to advocate candI-
dates. " 

"We do feel that Daniel Watt 
very clearly used his television 
show to promote hImself," saId 
Erik Smith, counsel for Kitamura . 
" His television show is on WCT¥, 
which is a Warren College enter-
prise, and it's owned by Warren 
College. This makes it a Warren 
College facility." 

Kitamura added to Smith's 
claims. 

"r felt ... after re;ding the 
bylaws and especia lly the one that's 
in question at this moment, [Watts ' 
WCTV showJ was a violation of 
that bylaw," Kitamura said. 

Wam and hJS counsel, Robert 
Forouzandeh, objected outrtght to 
the heartng, claIming It should he 
(h~m t sscd becall~e evidence was not 
presented to him a day before the 
hearing, as mandated In the elec-
tion bylaws. 

In addition, new eVIdence was 
added against \MaltS that day, 
which also viobted procedural 
bylaws. 

The judicial board, however, 
refused to dismiss the case, and the 
hearing went on. 

Forouzandeh and WattS argued 
that "Perfect Vision" is an edltortal.

Elections bylaws must be revised to 
prohibit misleading campaigning 

By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 
OPInion Editor 

If anything good has come out of this 
year'; A.S. elections - amI that's hlghl}' 
debatable - J[' the growing reCOgniDon 
that the elecoons bylaws are nddled 'nth 
problems. Whether those Oaws are vague 
wording, ill-defined term or flat-out loop-
hole., they have been exposed by the elec-
tions circus In whIch we've been snick for 
the past three weeks. 

\\'hat IS a poster' I low do we define 
"campaigning'" Ilow .hould elecuons com-
mittee hearIng; be run and deCided - and 
;hould there be an elections committee at 
all' \Vhlch pUnishments are appropmte for 
whIch violauons' These I sues are all cur-
rently being tackJed by members of the A.S . 
CouncIl and the UCSD community, while 
they struggle to leave the bylaws clearer and 
fairer for next yea r 's poliDcal hopefuls. 

But, perhaps the most necessaty change 
concerns conduct Issues that are not cur-
rently regulated by the bylaws: 

the candidate statement was tech meally true 
and therefore not grounds for pum hment 
or dlsquallficaoon. 

So what we have IS a candidate IIltenoon-

sta tement as to claIm that he was "the REAL

a problem, and the soluuon I ob"lous: add a 
provision to the bylaws that prorubits the 
deliberate mlSlnformaDon and mislcdding of

To be fm to Pall oul, he has long 
claimed that the purpose of the KeVIn H su 
Stunt was not to sabotage KeVIn hawn

In the bylaws; and Pallsoul IS now an active 
proponent of including In the bylaws a code 
of conduct to which candidates would have 
to adhere or face sancuon from the elections 
committee. Under this code of conduct, 
anyone conducting a campaign like the one 
he ran for Kevin Hsu could easIly be dis-

the problem - J['s the rules themselves that 
need changmg. We must trust the bodies 
that appoint elections committee members 
to elect representatives with good judg-
ment and a keen sense of fair play. 

As voters, we all want to know who we're 
electing and what they stand for. This 
requires honesty beyond the truth found In

educs and a deSIre to represent oneself and

plain to ee that many candidates for politi-

Changes would make elections a 

grievance-ridden nuisance 
BY DANIEL WATTS 
AsSOCiate Opinion Editor 

Throughout this campajgn, the elecnon 
comnllltee's heart ha been in the right 
place. The},\'e tried to do theIr beSt to 
enforce the rules and uphold the integnty of 
the elections, which has at times resulted in 
questionable rcs tnctl ons on candidates' 
rights to free expression. 

An mformal election reform com mince 
now continues this trend: the corruninec 
member ' hearts are in the right place, but 
some of the discussion of potential reforms 
has venrured into the realm of unconstiru-
tional restriction of speech. A proposed 
"Code of Ethics" with a provi ion outlawing 
"misleading I'oters" poses such a problem. 

First of all, this additional provision IS 
superfluous. Gross fabncation of facts and 
outright lies are already covered under the 
election bylaws' ban on "falsifying infonna-
tion on candidate tatements or campaign lit-
erarure." Damaging lies told about other can-
didatcs are covered by the prohi-

committee tha t, despite the late'., name, no 
one on M.A.CJ.C. was acrually a magician, 
ncr did any of them perform magic rricks at 
any time during the campaIgn . It '~ not too 
difficult to see how ndiculous these charges 
would become. 

A candidate's "misleading" of voters I far 
too easy to prove. All it takes to prove that a 
voter is misled is the testimony of a voter 
who tells the elections com mittee, " I feci 
rrusled." JudicIal traditIon has been to define 
such ambiguous laws in terms of what a 
"reasonable" person would con Ider I1m-
leading, but this means that the deCIsion to 
define "reasonable" is left to the judgment of 
the elections committee. VVhat the commit-
tee thinks is reasonable isn't necessa ril y what 
the average per on would t11ink is reason-
able. The election bylaws need to be nar-

rowly written to avoid the prob-
biDon of libel and slander. Both 
falSIfying mformanon and slan-
denng/iJbeling other candjdates 
are clear IflStances of misleading 
voters and are already covered 
under the current bylaws.

Gay priests are not the problem 
Abuse is not result of homosexuality 

By JENNifER sposno 
Senior Staff Writer 

As matters in the Middle East 
continue to galvanize Americans 
and occupy their attention, it is 
we ll worth re membering -
despite what CNN and Fox News 
might lead you to believe - that 
in other parts of the world, life is 
marching on. While the United 
States has remained fixated on its 
exercise in Iraq, the Vatican has 
been at work quietly drafting a 
document that may bar homosex-
uals from the Roman Catholic 
priesthood. 

It is unlikely that such a docu-
ment will reach the public before 
the summer. Speculation, howev-
er, i that it will recommend the 
restriction or ,tringent scrutiny of 
prospective priests If they profess 
or appear to display homosexual 
tendencies. 

The docul1lcnt is ostensi bly 
part of the Vatican's continucd

These words came from the pul -

Unfortunately, it IS still the

a complicated one 

Top-down propaganda

Chris taylor 

I n the lexicon of political trends, which changes each week o r even each day, the retro fashion 
is in . After a number of new chants 
and keywords such as "no blood fo r 
oil ," "de tabilization" and "shock 
and awe," the European political 
community has re-adopted an age 
old catch phrase: propaganda . 
Along With this are a several sup-
port phrase such as " media bias" 
and "TIght-wing conspiracy." 
Propaga nda has been used heavily 
by anyone and everyone advocatIng 
a given Idea. However, this round, 
the sarura tion of loaded words and 

phra~es actually brings mto lIght an

The Europeans arc right m 
thinking there IS a definite lant in 
American media. However, the typi-

is not thc correct interpretation of 
such a slant. First of all. anyone who

Priests: Vatican would 
miss the point with ban 

Pint: Public's preferences are source of 'bias' 

concinued from page 5 
of homosexual abuse most promi-
nently; they make for ensational 
headlines. 

Yet accordi ng to aJan. 9 repor! 
in a Salon.com article, "attorneys 
and sun'ivor networks e timate 
that from one-third 10 over a half 
of all victim of exually abu Ive 
priests are women ." By making the 
scandal 111 to a "homosexual" issue, 
the priesthood and the media have 
drowned out the voices of a bused 
females, and that only guarantees 
that the scars of abuse will linger 
all the longer among Catholic. 

In e sence, the problem is not 
one of homosexualiry bUl of fideli· 
ty. A man who has taken a vow of 
chastity as part of his admission to 
the priesthood should never violate 
that vow, whether with a woman or 
another man. And nobody of any 
sexual persuasion must be allowed 
to prey with impunity upon chil-
dren in his charge. 

These things may seem obvi-
ous. They have not proven them-
selves obvious, however, to the 
clergy who make comments depre-
cati ng homosexuals, or who scram-
ble to assist in the cover-up as sex-
ual abuse spi rals out of control 
within the ranks of the Catholic 
clergy. 

As the Vatican decides its offi-
cial stance on homosexuality in the 
priesthood, it might do well to 
make a broader adaptation of a 
document produced in 1999 by a 
committee of the Catholic 
German Bishops' Conference. It 
contains recommendations for 
German bishops on admitting 
homosexuals to the seminary. 
Among the things to be examined 
are whether the candidate "pos-
sesses the stabi lity to handle the 
burdens and temptations that can 
be expected," "can keep the inti-
mate sphere of his sexuallry sepa-
rate from hIS ministerial activiry" 

and whetller he "can ensure con-
vincingly that he has lived a chaste 
life ." 

The only thing that ought to be 
changed is to delete all references 
to "homosexuals" in the document, 
malcing the e standards the basis 
for evaluating any man of any ori-
entation eeklllg the priesthood. 

If the Vatican should choose to 
bar known homosexuals explicitly 
from the priesthood, it \vill only 
compound problems for the 
Catholic laity in severa l ways. 

First, with an estimated 10 to 30 
percent of seminarians identifying 
as homosexual, an already under-
staffed clergy cannot afford to lose 
men who are willing to commit to 
chastity and serve their god, 
regardless of their sexual orienta-
tion. In the end, the laity suffers 
again - first as victims of abuse, 
and then their churches are closed 
and programs are cut due to a lack 
of priests. 

Second, an attack on homosexu-
al priests will deepen fissures 
between gay Catholics and the 
church . Gay Catholics already feel 
a large degree of isolation from an 
establishment that purports to 
accept them , yet won't accept 
whom they love. 

With a ban on gay priests, the 
Vatican will have demonstrated 
that it is not addressing the prob-
lem at the root of the abuse sca n-
dals - the need to find commit-
ted candidates for the priesthood 
who will respect the vows they 
have made to their god - but that 
it de ires to find an easy scape-
goat. 

There will be little progre s 
unless the publ ic and the Vatican 
learn to accept gays and lesbians as 
whole persons with a healthy and 
God-given sexuality. Pointing the 
finger at homosexuals for the abuse 
scandals ets this goal back decades, 
if not centuries.

watered-down strains of socialism 
in the democratic party. With 
socia lism a defeated idea in main-
stream American politics, any trend 
in journalism that may be implicit-
ly supporting a European socialist 
standpoint will fail to obtain a wide 
audience. All that is left then is 

I N, which appears right-wing to 
all E uropeans. While plausible, this 
does not explain the reason that 
many journalists are scared of 
angering the American public by 
criticiung America. 

Leading up to lraqi interven-
tion, a thousand European editori-
als probed into the minds of 
Americans and attempted to 
explain why any Americans sup-
ported their government and the 
war. One of the aspects most clear-
ly shown was the desire of 
Americans to be heroes. Ignorant 
or intelligent, we have always 
thought of ourselves as defenders 
of democracy. We live for watching 
troops rolling through the streets 
with the liberated civilians cheer-
ing wildly. Conversely, Americans 
hate to be disliked. Most 
Europeans don't give credence to 
this argument because they thinlc if 
Bush disregarded Europeans and 
Arabs and ubsequendy brought 
global hatred to Americans, cer-
tainly the American public doesn't 
care for its image either. 

This is not the case. Many 
European editorials are now admit-
ting that, in fact, Americans tOlerat-
ed the hatred of the Europeans 
because they were gambling on the 
fact that liberating Iraq would 
prove to the angry masses that 
America was right in the end. 

Even the fact that Bush went 
before the U. . Security Council 
at all (considering how many mili-
tary interventions have occurred 
without the use of the security 
council, including French excur-
sions as well as American) shows 
that Americans require the legiti -

macy of the world, despite all the 
world's complicated political agen-
das. Media mogul Rupert 
Murdoch said before the war that 
Americans have an inferiority 
complex and worry too dlat the 
world loves them. While Murdoch 
is certainly one of the most biased 
men in media, he has a valid point. 
The fact that Americans have the 
strength in their busy lives to actu-
ally boycott the French, who in all 
reality have very little say in 
American policy (even if they'd 
like to think they have clout), they 
must care what the French dlink of 
America in the first place. 

" If Americans like to be 
'the gooi guys,' it makes 

perfect sense that 
Americans would dislike 
and even refuse to watch 

news coverage that 
att1lCks their status as 

A . " mencans. 
Therefore, if American like to 

be "the good guys," it makes per-
fect sense that Americans would 
dislike and even refuse to watch 
news coverage that attacks their 
status as America ns. The fier<;e 
patriotism that is enveloping the 
nation is not a fake one. It is so 
sincere that it bothers the public 
to watch correspondents be overly 
critical of the United States -
Bush or no Bush. 

Psychologists at the British 
Association for the Advancement 
of Science recently conducted a 
urvey of humor and how it dif-

fered among different nationali-
ties. They found that Americans 

have a tendency to laugh at jokes 
that make odler people appear Stu-
pid or inferior. If Americans enjoy 
being o n the giving end of a joke, 
one could infer that they will not 
want to be on the receiving end of 
harsh journalistic criticism, either 
in scathing editOrials or slanted 
newscasts. If a news outlet desires 
to se ll well in America, dley had 
better be nice to Americans, if not 
to Bush specifically. This is proved 
beyond a dou bt wi th the rise of 
Fox News, which claims to be an 
America- first and journalist-sec-
ond organization. 

This all lead to the conclusion 
that any bias that does exist in the 
media comes from a desi re of the 
American public to hear the story 
told a certain way. This is a much 
better explanation than a va t 
right-wing conspiracy headed up 
by the Bush administration . 
While this explanation is more 
fun and easier fodder for protest-
ers to riot about, Bush's image 
when elected into office was so 
unstable that it is foolish to think 
that the public would ever blindly 
believe him. With the polls on the 
war so divided, certain ly many 
people did not trust Bush. But that 
didn't cause the rise of an honest 
news company ready 10 attack 
America if need be. 

None of this is to say that 
media bias can't be a problem. But 
instead of heading to the White 
House to protest the govern-
ment's purported iron-fisted con-
trol over the media, perhaps we

MONDAY, APRIL 21, 200} THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 7 

Truth in Sig.ma Chi flyer issue is far from clear 
Those behind the abhorrent posting should corne forward 
By MARIANNE MADDEN 

Staff Writer 

In recent weeks, UCSD has 
suddenly become an overdy racial -
ly charged campus. A particularly 
mysterious incident occurred two 
weeks ago at the Price Center, 
International House and Earl 
Warren College where flyers bear-
ing images of Ku Klux Klan mem-
bers in from of a flaming cross, 
accompanied by the text "Don't get 
caught hangin'! : pring Rush 
2003" and Sigma Chi's Greek let-
ters appeared. The fl yers spurred a 
ISO-person rally at Price Center 
Plaza on April 16 and emphatic 
statements by Sigma Chi that it was 
not the source of the flyers. As yet, 
no one has claimed responsibility 
for the fl ye rs. 

Its hard to judge \vhat's more 
abhorrent: the possibility that SIgma 
Chi was me source of the posters, 
and was attempting to exploit bIg-
otry as a way to attract pledges, or 
the possibili~that some enemy of 
Sigma Chi attempted to smear the 
organization with such flyers . 

It's very likely that Signla Chi 
was being truthful when they dIS-
avowed any connection with the 
fl yers. Sigma Chi was founded in 
1855, and the current members o f 
its UCSD branch must certallll y 
realize that dlei r uccess as an orga-
nization depends on being inclusive 
and courteous to all potential 
pledges. They certainly would have 
realized beforehand mat such a 
fl yer design, with such strong 
imagery, would hun rather than 
help their cause - espeCIally when 
posted in International House, 
which attracl~ rac ial diversity. And 

it seems odd that a fraternity would 
make use of racial vio lence in their 
rush flyers rather than the positive 
aspects of rushing a fraternity -
brotherhood, social events, com-
muniry service and the like. 

This points to a person or orga-
nization, angry at Sigma Chi for 
some reason, resorting to cow-
arde s and fraud in an attempt to 
fram e the organization . 
Mischievous smear campaigns are 
hardl y an e ffective way to garner 
support for one's ca use, however, 
and there is now a campus full of 
angry people pitted against whoev-
er is responsible for the flyers. 

Very little certainty has emerged 
from this case thus far, but it is clear 
that whoever conceived and posted 
these fl yers must step forward quick-
ly, so this bizarre incident can be put 
behind lIS as quickly as possible. 
Granted that if the guilty party steps 
forward this week, they will have dle 
added bonus of coming clean during 
I late-Free Campus Week, which is 
sponsored by the tudent Office of 
Human Relations (an event that, for 
the f\vell aficionados among us, 
ITIJght be a strange reminder of the 
ecstatic celebration of H ate Week by 
the characters in the novel " 1984"), 
but is nonetheless impeccably timed. 

This whole thcllled week - its 
tide, at lea t - begs the question, 
shouldn't every week be hate-free? 
At U SD, we've shown a terrible 
willingness to tell ourselves that this 
is indeed the case; but in the past 
month especia lly, we've seemed to 
openl y ha te each other more tha n 
ever. The Itlvolci ng of race by 
Students First! members and their 
supporters after they were disquali-
fi ed from elections, the harassment

" On of tlJe most important 
points to consider is that 
posting flyers that are in 

extremely bad taste is not 
a crime in and of itself. " 

of anti-war protestors on Library 
Walk and the ilnilar harassment of 
gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgen-
der students and their 'a Utes while 
observing tlie Day of Silence on 
April 8, all point to a campus where 
people only seem to be able to 
express thei r opinions at the expense 
of others. This is indicative of a gen-
eral polari7..ation of American opi n-
ion: [n all sorts of arenas, people 
currently hold such convergent 
opinions that they have absolutely 
no common ground with the oppos-
ing side on which to negotiate. 

The Sigma Chi flyers were per-
fecdy timed to remind us, once 
again, that hatefulness still persists 
on campus and can involve such 

generic issues as resenting Greek 
organizations and irrational racial 
hatred as exemplified by the KKK. 
However, the people who quickly 
labeled the incident as a "hate crime" 
were jumping the gun a bit and were 
probably just reacting to the loaded 
KKK imagery on the flyer. 

A hate crime IS defined by the 
California Association o f Human 
Relations Organizations as "any act 
of intimidation, harassment, physical 
force or threa t of physical force ... 
motivated either in whole or in part 
by hosti lity to Isomeone'sJ real or 
perceived race, ethnic background, 
religious belief, sex, age, disability or 
sexual orientation, with the intention 
of causing fear or intimidation, or to 
deter the free exercise or enjoyment 
of any rights or privileges secured by 
the Constitution or the laws of the 
United tate of California whether 
or not performed under color of 
law." 

Under these guidelines, and 
without the knowledge of the actu-
al creator of the flyers, it's debat-
able whether the posting of the fly-
ers actually falls underthe category 
of a hate crime. 

One of the most important 
points to consider is that posting 
flyers that are in extremely bad 
taste IS not a crime in and of itself. 
That is why scores of white-
supremacist Web sites endure: 
Thei r content, however offensive 
and disgusting, is protected under 
the First Amendment. Under the 
law, it's perfectly legal to have irra-
tional , intense hatred; but it's not, 
of course, permissible to act on this 
hatred and commit an act of vio-
lence or harassment. It seems as If 
nothing beyond a moral crime and 

a horrendous failure of judgment 
has occurred, because the~e flyers 
haven't been proven to have caused 
any intimidation or act of violence, 
although me placement of the fly-
ers on a school campus may have 
some effect on its classification. 

Yet the whole question of har-
boring hatred toward nonwhItes and 
non-Christians may be Irrelevant, as 
these flyers were probably made to 
damage Sigma ChI and simply used 
the offensive imagery to thIS end. 
The maker of the flyers, assuming It 
was not a Sigma ChI member, was 
merely trying to paint the organiza-
tion as racist, so it's conceivable that 
the guilty party doesn't actually har-
bor any racism at all. 

Regardless of the actual role big-
otry played in this regrettable IIlCI-
dent, there is without a doubt the 
issue of dishonesry or, alternatively, 
fraud . If igma ChI was IIldeed 
responsible for the flyers, they were 
lying when they testified that they 
weren't (and, more seriously, have 
huge problems )udglllg what's 
appropnate to put on melr recnut-
ment flyers); and If the source of the 
flyers was someone outside of SIgma 
Chi, they were commllung fraud b} 
fal ifying the flyers and, III effect, 
posing as a member of the fraterlllty. 

But of course, everythlOg, 
IIlciuding the intent of the flyers in 
question, is ab olute peculation Jt 
this point. It's undelllable, though, 
that this IIlcident has wor ened the 
already riled-up campus chmate at 
UCSD, and that we'd JIl be better 
served by resolving thIS IIlcldent as 
soon as possible by rooting out the 
party responsible for posting the 
flyers, exposing whatever hatred 
they harbor.

Students First!: Slate to appeal disqualification to A.S. Judicial Board 
continued from page I 

slate T-shirt on the back of a lec-
ture hall seat, thus the committee 
ruled, campaigning in the class-
room . 

Pourazary declined to com-
ment. 

According to student advocate 
Robert Fourazandeh, who argued 
opposite Pourazary in all case 
Involving tudents First!, he will be 
part of "a broad coalition of differ-
ent ideologJes" that will be defend-
ing the el ection committee 's deci -
sion during the judICIal board hear-
Ing . 

Fourazandeh had also defended 
independent presidential candidate 
Kevin Hsu against a grievance filed 
by Harish Nandagopal, who ran on 
the Students First! slate as vice 
president finance. 

"I am completely confident the 
initial ruling will be l\Jlheld," 
Fourazandeh said. "There are a lot 
of holes in the appeal. The bottom 
line is they're not even challenging 
the verdict." 

The written appeal explained 
that it found grounds to appeal 
the deciSIOn due to pro edural 
unfairnes and excessive sanc-

tions. 
In the procedural unfairness 

category, the statement explained 
that the elections committee failed 
to provide the slate with evidence 
pertaining to the York v. Studtnts 
First.' hearing the day preceding the 
hearing so tha t a defense could be 
prepared, as mandated in the elec-
tions bylaws. 

The grievance had been filed 
April 10, and the hearing took 
place on the afternoon of April II, 
with the defenSe obtaining the evi-
dence earlier in the day on April 
11.

The appeal also claimed lack of 
procedure in regards to the elec-
tion committees reprobation of the 
Asian and Pacific Islander Student 
Alliance posters, endorsing 
Students First! candidates, the dis-
cussion of which was argued should 
not have taken place in the hearing 
since only non-endorsed posters 
were mentioned in the initial viola-
tions report. 

Other claims of lack of proce-
dure stemmed from thc elections 
committee's decision to deliberate 
on the April II cases out of order, 
with the slatc accusing the commit-

tee of deliberating on the Roditis v. 
Abeyt case first in order to set a 
precedent for the second and from 
"failure of the elections committee 
to prohibit ... Fourazandeh from 
asking harassing religious ques-
tions." 

During the hearing, 
Fourazandeh had asked witness 
Frances Galvon whethcr she was 
convinced she could not have 
missed taking down a poster, asking 
her, "You are a god, is that what 
you're claiming to be?"

MONDAY. APRIL ZI. 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Housing: Some doubles converted to triples 
conlinued from page I 

"Warren had to redistribute 
their spaces to help us out," said 
Yolanda Trevino, residential dean 
of Marshall. 

The decision to reserve a por-
tion of the Lowers for next year's 
freshmen along with the decision to 
house three students in certain 
rooms was met by complaints from 
evenl Marshall students. 

"I'm mad at ResLife because I 
wanted a singlc," said Jocelyn 
Wong, a Marshall freshman who 
will be living in Warren's Black 
I Iall next year. "Thcy said volun-
tary triples, and it's not voluntary 
anymore. Jlow do you miscalcu-
late by that much? And ResLife is 
seriously already anti-social. 
\Vhile the other colleges have nor-
mal dorms, we have suites. So it's 
already hard to meet people, and 
now they're putting freshmen in 
the Lowers?" 

Other students were disappoint-
ed in the lack of communication 
between ResLife and the student 
body. The original housing 
brochur~s and the room selection 
Web site do not mention the possi-
bility of Marshall snldents living in 
Warren or in the Marshall residen-
tial halls nexl year. Both the 
brochures and the Web ite OIl 0 
claim that students can triple-up on 
a voluntary, but not a mandatory 
basis. 

''('m disappointed that the office 
of residential life decided to room 
freshmen in the Lowers without 
getting any input from the student 
body," said Travis Silva, chairman-
elect of Thurgood Marshall 
College Student Council. "It eerns 
that there was a lack of student 
input in that decision. I'm also a lit-
tle disappointed that the office of 
ResLife didn't communicate really 
effectively with the students the 
policies that they were going 
through with. They didn't tell us 
until this week there'd be forced 
tripling." 

According to Trevino, Marshall 
students were made aware of the 
possibility of living in Warren at 
the housing information session on 
Feb. 27, and this possibility wa 
confirmed at the econd ession on 

Rar.hel A. Garcia/GuorolCln 
On the move: Thurgood Marshall College students Katrina Gonzaga and Kathy Lee

April 13. 

In John Muir College, 80 per-
cent of single rooms were saved 
for continuing students, and dou-
ble rooms were also converted to 
triples . I lousing Oyers and 
brochures depict Muir and 
Warren apartments as choices for 
cominuing Muir students' hous-

" We just don't have 
adequate housing for all 

our students."

ing, but continuing tudents were 
also housed in the residential halls 
of Tioga and Tenaya, as well as in 
Pepper Canyon, Geneva Hall in 
Eleanor Roosevelt College and 
Discovery Hall in Revelle 
College. 

" [ResLifeJ couldn't have been 
more fair in the way it was done, in 
terms of the lottery system," said 
Diana Combs, a Muir freshman 
who had a much later room selec-
tion appointment time. ""Ve just 

got the bad end of the stick. 
Unfortunately, they don't have 
enough ideal spaces for their stu-
dents." 

A few students were left off of 
the list for housing appointments, 
even though they filed an applica-
tion. Faryn Agiert, a Marshall 
freshman, filed her housing appli-
cation but was not on the housing 
list. She will be waitli ted begin-
ningJune 2. 

Other complaints about the 
housing selection process arose 
during Room Selection Day. 

"I'm disappointed about the 
whole [situation] - where if one 
person's not there, then they get 
dropped - because one of my peo-
ple didn't show up," said Heera 
Basi, a Revelle freshman who wili 
be living in Pepper Canyon next 
year. 

Concerns about the two-year 
housing guarantee for entering 
freshmen have also been raised. 
According to Trevino, a one-year 
guarantee is more practical, bur has 
been shown to decrease student 
involvement in organizations and 
on campus in general. 

"We just don't have adequate 
housing for all our students," 
Trevino said. "We're high com-
modity now for housing space." 

Appeal: SF! claims DQ is 'burden' on students 
continued from page 

"She did not have to answer my 
question," Fourazandeh aid . " he 
could have remained silent or her 
counsel could have made an objec-
tion at that time." 

In the category of excessive 
anctions, the appeal argued that 

precedent had not been followed, 
citing a pa t case where a slate was 
punished for a poster violation by 
writing an apology and remaining 
limited in their number of po terS 
for two days. 

The appeal also argued that 
disqualifying II members of the 
slate who would have otherwi e 
become members of the incoming 
A.S. Council was "a huge burden 
on the student body and has a ig-
nificant impact on the perceIved 

legitimacy of the incoming coun-
cil." 

"That accu ation makes no

sen e since the elections committee 
didn't know these people would be 
Willner, and didn't get the electi n 

results until afterwards," 
Fourazandeh said. ''It shouldn't be 
taken into con ideration. The bot-
tom line is whether they commit-
ted the violation." 

The appeal also accused the 
elections committee of allowing 
hearsay testimony to be allowed 
into the ca e, but did not give any 
specifics. 

The temporary restralnlllg 
order was requested, according to 
the statement, so that the judicial 
board would not have to remove 
any students who had already taken 
office, and so that the judicial board 
would not, in having to do this, be 
adverse to ruling against the elec-
tions committee's decision. 

The new council will take office 
fifth week of pring quarter. 

Watts: Parties dispute ownership of WCTV

"[WCTV] is a Re idcntial Life

Forouzandch ald. 

WattS also said that ReSIdential

"They are funded through

"Residential Life is funded by

The Warren ollege Judicial 
Board deliberated before rclea. ing 
their finding, when in a three-to-
one vote, they ruled III favor of 
Kitamura. 

Watrs was then eli qualified 
from the electIon. 

The majority opinion of the 
judicial board felt that W I IS

on many different ground, behind

Admit: Admits' average GPA is 4.04 
continued from page I 

The increasing amount of applications 
has caused various UC campuses to become 
more selective. Among UCSD admits, sttl-
dents have a mean high school grade point 
average of 4.04 and a 1,288 average score on 
the SAT. 

"What it says is that UCSD, though it is 
a young institution, continues to attract 
excellent students and faculty," said Interim 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Enrollment 
Management Mae Brown. 

Of those who were accepted to UCSD, 
6,899 were also identified as Eligible in the 
Local Context, meaning 
they are in the top four per-
cent of their high school. 

" 

"Overall, admissions of students have 
been up for the past five years," said UCOP 
spokesperson Hanan Eisenman. "Some 
campuses have been more selective for 
everyone and that could explain the drop. 
Also, educational inequities have adverse 
effects on underrepresented srudents while 
more represented students are becoming 
eligible for UC." 

Because of the influx of freshman appli-
cants, about 3 ,676 students were offered 
admissions for winter or spring quarter for 
the entire University of California. 

Additionally, 6,472 students were 
offered admission to a 

"We are pleased with the 
academic strength of stu-
dents and faculty who are 
attracted to our campus," 
Brown said. "That is some-
thing to be proud about and 
hopefully, the campus will 
continue to grow." 

We are pleased with 
the academic 

campus that was not 
selected in their applica-
tion . This process, called a 
' referral,' is another wa}' 
that the University of 
California is dealing with 
the increase of student 
applications. strength of students 

and faculty who are 
attracted to our According to University of California Office of the 

President's data, proportions 
of underrepresented students 
have also increased moder-
ately. Underrepresented Stu-
dents make up of 19.8 per-
cent of the admitted class in 
the UC system. Except for 

campus. 

"We had a strong, steady 
growth for the last few 
years," Eisenman said. "We 
are pleased to accommodate 
students who are eligible 
and work hard to achieve 
requirements. "

UCSD was one of the campuses which

Mexican-Americans, 534 Latino and 74

Steve Robbins shares 
his insights on business 

and rOlllance 
It is difficult to imagine anyone in 

Southern California who has not heard Steve 
Robbins' voice. Along with his brother Skip, 
their radio commercials proliferate the air 
waves telling all about Robbins Bros., the 
"World's Biggest Engagement Ring Store." 
But love or hate the corny advertisements, 
Steve Robbins IS the creator of a unique 
business that caters to young couples in love. 
Robbins is a UCSD graduate from John 
Muir College, who majored in sociology in 
1978. The GWlrdifJII pops the question and 
Steve explains the reasoning behind the 

stores themselves, the ervices they offer 
and even the commercials. 

Guard/all : How was your experi-
ence here at UCSD' 

teve Robbins: r loved It; the 
people in the sociology department 

were great. \Ve have fun . My thesis 
was on comIC books. 

G: J low did you get into thc 
engagement ring bu iness? 
SR: I came from three generations of 

family jewelry tores. My grandpa started in 
eattle in the 1920 and '305. I grew up in 

Pasadena, Caltf. , around my father's store, 
and r loved intcracong with the people 
there. My brother and I were pretty young 
[when we took O\'er the bu,mess], 0 we 
identified with young couples getting 

engaged. We thought 
it would be 

cool to focus 
soley on 

young 
couple, 
ta ki ng 
Out the 
anxiety, 
the 

stress and just help them and teach them 
about buying a quality diamond. We wanted 
it to be an experience, so we don 't consider 
ourselves a jewelry store. We're more aboU[ 
engagements, romance and weddings than 
just a product. We wanted to open the 
world's biggest engagement ring store, so we 
closed all our mall stores and opened the big 
stores. 

G: What do you consider your keys to 
succes ? 

R: We just focus on one category: young 
couples. We knew you can't be the best ~t 
everything, so we wanted 
to be the best at one thing. 
And we get couples of all 
hapes and sizes WIth the 

only thing in common 
being that they are twO 
people who want to be 
together. Now, we also 
help plan the weddmgs. 
Anyone who buy a ring

engagement itself and 
even help making a Web ite to announce the

G: 0 I have to a k, is it really you in 
those radio commercials? 

SR: (Laugh) Sadly, yes. " e couldn't 
afford to hire professional vOIce actors at 
firs t. 

G: Well, it doesn't really sound like your 
voice. 

R: Oh reall y, well how about this' 'Hey 
Skip! Did you hear about our new thmg at 
Robbins Bro ?' 

G: Oh wow, okay that is you. I there 
really a Skip? 

SR: Yeah, that's really my brother's 
name. I think we would have picked 
something like Dirk if we wanted 
something that wasn't real . Obviously 
we're a little more low key in real 
life, but it is an exaggeration of our 
real life relation hip. He's the more 
practical one, and I get excited about 
the new ideas. We know the ads don't 
sound professional, but in a business 
like this, the number one thing is 
trust, so we thought hey, let's be our-
selves, not JUSt a big faceless organiza-

tion. And people are really surprised when 
they come to the stores because it is 3 really 
different feel from our ads. 

G: How did you propose to your wife? 
SR: It's kind of a long slory. Well, [ really 

wanted to make sure our engagement was a 
special moment she always remembered. 
Since our first date was at an Pedro Pier, we 
went there and had dinner overlooking the 
bay. I had the ring in my pocket and we were 
walking along the beach and holding hands. 
I think she figured I was going to ask her, so 
I was trying to be romantic, and she was 
being a pain, makmg Jokes and stuff because 
she was nervous. 0 1 thought no, I'm not 
doing It because she's not playmg along, and 
r want to wait until the moment is fight. So 
then the moon IS commg up, the ocean IS 
beauoful and he' sull not playmg along at 
all . I'm thlll.kmg great, two romanOL uppor-
tunlOes gone. Then, we got m the car and 
Just SOrt of drove amliessly unol wc got to a 
lake. We staned walkmg along the lake, and 
I think at this point she started to fecI sorry 
for me, since she had been bemg a pam all 
night. 0 we starred talking aboU[ our mem-
orie and what we wanted for the future . . \nd 
we stopped in front of this beauuful old 
colonial style home, and it was really freez-
ing, but I could feel that thIS was the 
moment. Then right as l reach IntO my 
pocket and give her the ring, \I stans to rain. 
We were hugging and she was crying, and it 
was freezing and raining, and that was our 
moment. 

G: \Vhat advice would you gIve couples 
in college considering gemng engaged' 

R: Let" say it is my daughter 1'111 talking 
to because I don't have to hold back. I'd say 
make ure your head and heart are in sync 
and talk through what you want in the 
future. Do you have similar goals, both want 
children, that kind of thing, that you don't 
want to find out later? Then, Just try to cre-
ate moments and traditions as a couple. Take 
time to do it right. Make an mformed 
choice. The whole thing can be intimidating 
for a guy; that's why we offer them help find-
ing the ring and planning a perfect engage-
ment. I ay carpe diem, eize your moment 
and don't forget to invite kip and me to the 
wedding!

Humanitarian efforts abroad reap rewards 
Trip to EI Salvador gives students new perspective 

By MASHA DAY 
Contributing Writer 

In thi fast-paced world, people 
rarely stop to appreciate the things 
they take for granted. A 20 minute 
morning shower seems routine, a 
personal car which blasts music 
seems ordinal,), and a trip to the 

. doctor's office when feeling sick is 
not pleasant, but far from unusual. 
r n America, it is ofren believed that 
the quality of life to which mmt cit-
izens have grown accustOmed IS the 
norm and shared hy'the people all 
over the world. The reality I~ that

Forty students from UC 
Berkeley, Stanford Un iversity, 
University of O hio and UCSD par-
ticipa ted in the program. The stu-
dents helped local farmers dive~sify 
their crops, thereby putting less 
demand on the already weak soil and 
planting crops that wi ll earn money. 
Because 40 students were working 
there, they were able to accomplish 
much in a short period of time. 

This was seen first hand by a 
group of ten UCSD students, who 
went to the poverty-stricken COttn -
try of F.I Salvador dUring spring 
break. WhIle their classmates were 
enjoying the sun and beach or much 
needed pampering at home, this 
group traveled to a tiny town in the 
Usultan province to do humanitari-
an work. The trip was organized by 
I li llel and La Coordinatora. La 
Coordinatora is an EI Salvadorian 
agency in it fourth year of opera-
tion that works in conjunction with 
the U .S. to help citizens who suffer 
from natural disasters and war dam-
age that have plagued the countty.

stood that hfe in );:1 Salvador was 
very different from San Diego.

in dorms III a La Coorclinatora ite 
that werc a far cry from the UCSD 
housing. The dorms werc simple 
structures with concrete noors and 
walls, tin roofs and no air condi-
tioning or hot running W"Jter. 
Desp ite these spar e accommoda-
tions, the students quickly began to 
immerse themselves in the daily life 
and were very sad to leave.

Their week-long trip allowed the 
students a true view of life in EI 

a lvador. Far from the tourist traps 
of the malll city, the group worked 
harder than they ever had, often side 
by side with local fanners . Ilolloway 
describes their days as the longest, 
most hardworking that she ever 
experienced. Mo t people were 
amazed at how productive they were 
durmg this week. Waking up before 
seven on most days, the group would 

bea 

eat a home-cooked meal and be out 
working hard by nine. The work, 
though grueling, was very satisfying 
because the students were able to ee 
the results of their efforts. 

"We did tangible work to aid a 
communJty that was and still is in 
need of help," llolloway said.

that touched many people was

day with them, which provided 
them an opportunity to become 
more immersed in the cultural 
aspect of the country. Holloway 
made an especially profound con-
nection with her host .family, still 
keeping in contact WIth the mother. 
She described their last night in EI 
Salvador as being very poIgnant. 
The host family began to cry as 
they said thm good byes. 

"It was a very touchmg moment.

"I taught my host family how to 
play Go Fish," she said. "It was so 
imple, yet the people were 0 

excited and interested; it was truly 
touching." 

"I have never seen poverty 
before. It was a strange feeling to 
come back to the sta tes where we 
have so much so easily, Imowing that 
the people we were living with have 
to work real ly hard for 0 much less.

their reality," Holloway said. 

The trrp left a deep Impact on 
everyone that many of the people 
didn't expect. 

"If everyone saw what we saw, 
everyone would be diffe rent. 
Everyone should see poverty, then 
they will recognize the need that 
exists," Holloway said. "While peo-
ple should be grateful for what they 
have, they should give to people 
what they don't have just because 
it's the right tlung to do."

Softball takes one of its four games 
Two close loses make for dismal weekend 

By JOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

UC D softball played two 
game against UC Davi and two 
agatnst Chico State this weekend, 
April I and April 19, respective-
ly, 10 tng both games t Da\1S and 
getting a split against Chico. 

The Triton' first of four 
games resulted in a 4-1 loss to 
the Aggles that saw UCSD fresh-
man starter tephanie Kurz suf-
fering her seventh loss of the sea-
son in her complete-game per-
formance . UC D jumped to an 
early lead in the third, sconng It 
lone run, but DavIs responded 
with one run of its own tn the 
bottom of the third, in addition 
to twO in the fourth and one in 
the sixth. 

The Triton run came from 
jUnior Amy Menee, who went 1-
for-4, scoring off a throwing 
error. UCSD's three other hits 
came from junior Kim Aggabao, 
sophomore Jamie Hurst and 
freshman Jenny Spencer. 

"We made some errors, which 
shouldn 't have happened . The 
score should have been I-I," said 
UCSD head coach Patti 
Gerckens. 

The second game against the 
Aggies started off very promisi ng, 
with the Tritons once again taking 
the lead early, scoring once in 
both the first and second innings 
and adding one in the SiXth. 
However, in the bonom of the 
sixth, Davis opened it up to score 
eight runs, knocking out starter 
Jodie Bland, a junior, and givmg 
her a sixth loss on the eason, 
puning her record at 5-6. 

UCSD collected seven hits at 
the plate, includmg two from 
sophomore Breanne Cope, who 
also cored a run. The fWO other 
runs for the Tntons came from 
Metlee and Spencer, whJle RBis 
came from II urst and cnlOr 
Knsnn I j unstad. 

"\ Ve took the lead early, b'lt tn

executed a squeeze bunt, and we 
made a very bad mentaJ play, 
which let in the winning run. 
From there they just started hit-
ting off us; no maner where we 
pitched it, they hit it." 

The first game against the 
W ildcats saw UCSD coming 
from behind to pull off a 3 -2 win, 
giving Kurz her ninth win of the 
season and putting her record at 
9-7. The Tritons fell behind in 
the second inn lOg, but scored 
twO in the third and one in the 
Ifth. 

Hurst knocked in two of 
UCSD's three runs, and Cope 
brought in the third. Mettee 
scored two runs for the Tntons, 
and Spencer scored the third. 

"Our pltchmg executed all day, 
and we played really well," 
Gerckens said. ~Jamie came up 
with a key hit and a suiCide bunt, 
wtuc~ helped put US ahead for the 
WIn . 

In the second game against 
ChiCO, UCSD lost 4-3 10 extra 
11m lOgS, with the loss going to 

Bland, her seventh of the season. 
The turning point of the game 
came in the sixth inning when 
Bland walked in a run, tying the 
game at 3-3 . 

While the Tritons took a one-
run lead in the first inning and 
added two more in the third, they 
failed to score in either of the two 
extra innings. Hurst once again 
brought in twO RBI , this time 
hitting a single, scori ng Menee 
and Spencer. 

"Both tephanie and J odie 
handled the situation of trymg to 
find the inconsistent strike zone 
well," Gerckens said. "We could 
have come home With three out of 
four wins, but we played better 
than our past few games." 

UCSD's overall record is now 
19-26, and its California 
Collegiate Athletic As oCiation 
record is 10-16. The Tritons' next 
games will take place at the C U 
Bakersfield 10untaln Dew 
Classic in Bakersfield, Calif., 
which will run from Apnl 25 
through April 27 .

Water polo: Tritons will play 
at home again in NCAAs 

conllnued from page 20 
trating, and that was because of all 
the emotions; it may be bei ng our 
last game here and all ." 

The Tritons showed up in the 
second half as a focused team, shut-
ting down the Coyote offense and 
finding their goal- coring touch. 
The senio rs took the reins of the 
scoring, contributing four goa ls in 
the final two period. The result 
was a lopsicted 7-2 second half and 
a 13 -6 Tri ton victory. 

"We're going to face San 
Bernardino in the first round up in 
Bakersfield [in the WWPA cham-
pionships), and it was important for 
us to show them tonight that 
they're not goi ng ro have an easy 
game," said Triton head coach 
Larry Sanders. 

The next afternoon, the Trirons 
headed out ro face DSU in the 
second annual Harper C up, named 
after current Triton men's water 
polo head coach Denny Harper, 
who coached both Sanders and 
current Aztec head coach Carin 
Crawford at UCSD. 

The Tritons sought to bring the 
cup to UC D for the first time, 
and by jumping out to a 2-1 lead 
before the second quarter, it 
seemed as if they were going to be 
successful. The Aztecs came charg-
ing back, converting three 6-on-5 
man-up op~rtunities, while aJ low-

ing only one Triton goal, taking a 
4-3 lead at half-time. 

UCSD played tough in the 
third, with Tucker replying ro 
another Aztcc goal with a goal of 
her own to keep thing close at 5-4. 

In the fourth, however, SD. U 
pulled ahead of the Tritons for 
good, this time with four goa ls. 
Tucker added o ne more goal, but 
UCSD couldn 't come up with any 
more to answer thc Aztec chal-
lenge. Tucker led the Tritons with 
three goals, while Boyle and 
Bantilan-Smith each contributed a 
goal. With the 9-5 triumph , the 
Aztecs will continue to possess the 
1 larper Cup and the mythical ti tie 
of City Champion. 

After finishing the cason with a 
solid 22 - 13 record, the Tritons 
look ahead to the WWPA 
Championships on April 25 
through April 27, 10 hopes of cap-
turing a conference title , and with 
U SD playing host to rhe 
National Collegiate Athl etic 
Association Women's Water Polo 
Championship th is year, the 
opportunity to play one more game 
at Canyonview Pool. 

"ill practice, we always see these 
giant stand [erected exclusively for 
the NCAA championships], and its 
just extra motivation for us to come 
home and finish up the season in 
the final four," Keesey sa id .

UCSD men's tennis trip over Gauchos 
Tritons drop close road match to UCSB, 4-3 

By CYNTHIA CHAVEZ 
Staff Writer 

T he UCSD men's tennis team 
played a close match against UC 
Santa Barbara, but ended up los-
ing 4-3 in the non-conference 
action on April I S in Santa 
Barbara, Calif. 

T he Division II Tritons faced 
tough competition playing the 
Division I Gauchos, who were sec-
ond in the Big West Conference 
coming into Wednesday's match. 

"I think we were too cautious. 
We need to go into the match and 
co~pete .like it is ours and fight for 
It like It IS ours," aid UCSD head 
coach Eric Steidlmayer. 

In doubles, UCSB rook two of 
the three matches for an early 2- 1 
lead over UCSD. At No. I doubles, 
junior Sameer Chopra and sopho-
more Bryan Swat! were defeated by 
Carlos Palencia and Mirco 
Schwindt S-4. At No. 2, freshman 
Tommy Novak and junior Jeff 
Wilson were defeated by Mike 
Placek and AJex Anselme 8-4. The 

lone win for the Tritons came at 
the hands of seniors Sean Nagel 
and Mike Meyer, who defeated 
Jerome C han and Nick Brotman S-
6. 

In singles, the Tritons split the 
six matches with the Gauchos. At 
No. I , C hopra defeated Carlos 
Palencia 4-6, 7-6, 10-3, while at 
No.2, Swan lost to Mirco Schwindt 
6-2, 7-5. At No. 3, Meyer defeated 
Mike Placek 7-6, 6-3, while at No. 
4, Emil Novak lost to AJex Anselme 
6- 1, 6-2 . At No . 5, Junior Blake 
Wilson-Hayden lost to Nick 
Brotman 6-4, 6- 1, and at No. 6, 
Wilson defeated Leo Basica 6-2,4-
6,7 -6. 

"We played pretty well. We 
need to tighten up our ability to 
compete all the way through, 
despite whatever distractions may 
or may not exist," Steidl mayer said . 
"I feel like we are improving in that 
but could be better. We also need 
to believe we will win and compete 
like it." 

T he Tritons have seen their fair 
share of tough matches during the 

second half of the season, playing 
against the top teams of the nation. 
Their confidence and attitude has 
improved as a result, and they feel 
positive that they can contend with 
any team, according to 
Steidlmayer. 

UCSD is first in the West 
Region of the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association with a 16-5 
overall record and a 5 -0 record in 
their conference. 

The UCSD men's tennis team 
made quite a leap in the rankings, 
moving up from No. 20 to No. 13 
in the nation. 

"The ranJcings jump was quite

Tritons end regular season with split 
Water polo can't take home Harper Cup 

History repeats itself for 
women's tennis team 

By DANIEL DiAl 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's water 
polo team sped down the final 
saetch of the 2003 regular season 
this past weekend, splitting games 
with CSU San Bernardino and 
SD U. 

In the emotionally charged 
regular season home finale on 
April 18, UCSD's departing 
eniors treated the home crowd to 

one more dazzling performance 
by opening the offensive flood-
gates after a close first half to 
handily defeat the Coyote, 13-6. 
The TritOns carried the momen-
tum of the victory with them 
across town to face the Aztecs In 
the Harper Cup on April 19, but 
couldn't produce the same results 
in a hard fought 9-5 loss. 

The TritOn went intO their 
final home game of the eason 
again t conference foe CS an 
Bernardino, seeking to gain 
momentum before the Western 
Water Polo Association champi-
onships begin on April 25. Before 
the battle commenced, Triton 
seniors Dana Tucker, Danielle 
Boylc, Samara ilverman, 
Elizabeth Keesey, Renae Coulter, 
Karl Lyman and Danielle Bourret 
were honored in a pre-game cere-
mony, commemorating their con-
tributions to UCSD women's 
water polo.

The UCSD women's crew com-
peted in the annual San Diego City 
Championships on April 19. One of 
the lasl before the season's champi-
onships, this regana, with competi-
tion between UCSD, USD and 
SDSU, IS a good indicator of how 
the team is doing. 

The Tritons participated in six 
races. UCSD finished second in 
the frosh eight/novice four, first in 
the novice eight, third in the sec-
ond varsity eight, third in the var-
sity eight, third in the varsity four 
and second in the second novice 
eight. 

"All crews were very happy with 
their races and feel the speed work 
we've done in the past week is 
strengthening their stan and fin -
ish," said UCSD women's head 
coach Patti Pinlc.erton. 

The first race was the frosh 
eight/novice four. SDSU finished 
first with a time of 8:03 .5, UCSD 
second with 8:15.9 and USD third 
with 8:33 .7. In UCSD's boat were 
coxswain Arianna Pilram, Megan 
Kelly, Lauren Ruiz, Carly Moore

slow one for UC D, as game jit-
ters seemed to contribute to shaky 
play early on. Keesey bounced in 
three goals, and Boyle and junior 
Meris Bantilan-Smith contributed 
scores with shots from six meters 
out. The Coyotes managed to find 
holes in the distracted TritOn 
defense, responding to UCSD's 
six goals with four of their own, 
despite the fact that the San 
Bernardino offense consisted 

mainly of shots coming from the 
same spot toward the northeast 
corner of the pool. The TritOns 
held off the Coyotes while strug-
gling with their emotions, main-
taining the 6-4 lead going intO 
halftime. 

"Everything was so emotional," 
Tucker said. "The first quarter and 
a half, we didn't come out concen-

Track continues to break records at two meets 
Sung, Pope lead the women's team at Mt. SAC, Pomona 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Staff Writer 

Two difficult meets took place 
this weekend for the UCSD track 
and field team, and from the twO 
meets came twO track standouts. 
Although the team performed 
well, it was the tndividual stand-
Outs who were important at the 
twO competitions, which were 
crowded With the beSt track and 

field talent from across the coun-
try; the Tritons' Audrey Sung and 
Julie Pope distinguished them-
selves with memorable perfor-
mances that broke seemingly solid 
records. 

"They are staying composed 
and competing well in the face of 
elite competition," said UCSD 
head coach Tony Salerno. 

Senior All-American Sung 
continued to demonstrate her 

consistency and determination 
when she broke yet another 
UCSD record in the 5,000-meter 
race at the Mt. San Antonio 
College Relays. Sung's time of 
17:00.25 broke Michelle Conlay's 
record of 17 : 14.70 from 1992. 
Sung's 20th-place achievement 
was not only a National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
championship-qualifying perfor-
mance, but also follows a long 

line of accomplishments in the 
past. 

Sung had been named the

"I wiU miss the game of soccer. 
I will miss playing at the level of
