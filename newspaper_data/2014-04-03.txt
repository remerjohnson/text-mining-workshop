A suspected drunk driver killed 
a graduate student in a hit-and-
run accident at Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography on March 28 around 
10:15 p.m. The victim, 27-year-old 
Rachel Anne Morrison, was a Ph.D. 
student studying marine biology and 
focusing on fisheries management.

According to an NBC San Diego 
article, the driver ran a stop sign 
and hit her as she was crossing the 
street at the intersection of Camino 
Del Mar and Coast Boulevard in 

Del Mar. He was later found at an 
apartment complex in La Jolla and 
identified as 41-year-old Christopher 
Stockmeyer. He was charged on at 
least four counts including felony 
driving under the influence, felony hit 
and run and vehicular manslaughter 
while intoxicated. Stockmeyer 
was then checked into the Vista 
Detention Center.

Morrison was taken to the 
Scripps La Jolla hospital where she 
was pronounced dead on arrival. A 
friend who was walking across the 
street with Morrison was able to 
jump out of the car’s way and was 
not injured.

Morrison was from Massachusetts 
and received her undergraduate 
degree from Boston University. A 
friend of Morrison sent a statement 
to NBC 7 about Morrison.

“Rachel was a beautiful person, 
inside and out,” the friend said in 
the statement. “She was dedicated to 
her work in ocean conservation and 
exploration. 

“She enjoyed simply being out on 
the water. She was a brilliant, giving 
and selfless person that always had a 
smile on her face.”

University of California’s largest 
union representing more than 
22,000 service and patient care 
technical workers — American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees Local 3299 — 
ratified a four-year contract with the 
University of California after recent 
UC health workers’ strike in early 
March and two years of bargaining. 

Over 99 percent of patient 
care technical workers voted on 
Monday, March 31 to ratify the new 
agreement for a compromise that 
increases workers’ benefits.
With this new agreement in place, 
the UC system was able to avoid 
another strike which would have 
cost the UC $10 million a day.

The contract allowed a 4.5-percent 
wage increase for all PCT workers by 
May 2014 and a 4-percent increase 
every year for the next three years

In addition, the new agreement 
removed the “emergency” call-
offs — which gave the UC system 
layoff powers in case of internal 
emergencies — that was previously 
imposed on patient care workers. 
According to the UC Office of 
the President Communications, 
the AFSCME believed that the 
emergency call-offs “enabled 
hospital administrators to make 
unlimited layoffs.”

The UC system also agreed to 
grant protection for PCT workers 
and minimize outsourcing. If the 
UC system fails to offer jobs to 
PCT workers after outsourcing 
jobs, AFSCME will gain grievance 
and arbitration rights that gives 
them more leverage in future labor 
negotiations with UC leaders.

In terms of affordable healthcare, 
the UC system froze PCT workers’ 
healthcare fees at 2014 rates for 
the next four years from Kaiser 
and Health Net Blue and Gold 
Healthcare providers.

PCT workers also gained more 
seniority protection from this 
contract in terms of layoffs, transfers, 
promotions and scheduling. Shift 
assignments, work hours and 
vacations are determined based 
on seniority and given priority to 
employees with more years working 
in the UC system.

Furthermore, the UC system 
has agreed to increase pension 
contribution by 2.5 percent by July 
2014, improving pension protection 
for workers.

AFSCME 3299 President Kathryn 
Lybarger worked closely with the UC 
system to negotiate a compromise 
for PCT workers and thinks the 
agreement is significant.

READY FOR DEBATE
A debate between Vice Presidential candidates from Let’s Act! and Tritons Forward for next year’s A.S. Council was held at Price Center 

Plaza on April 2. Above,Tritons Forward candidate for VP Campus Affairs Amber Hawthorne expresses her views on campus issues.

Espresso Roma, also known as Cafe Roma, closed on Friday, March 7. UCSD University Centers is currently negotiating with Starbucks 
to open a location in Cafe Roma’s place.

Previously in December 2013, the University 
Centers Advisory Board voted 11-4-0 to consider 
Starbucks Coffee Company as a replacement for 
Espresso Roma Cafe in Price Center. UCAB Chair 
Sammy Chang, who is optimistic that Starbucks will 
open, was part of the committee that decided to allow 
for a change from Cafe Roma to Starbucks.

“Cafe Roma wasn’t in a great financial state,” Chang 
said. “Before, there were a lot of customer complaints. 
The overall consensus was that Cafe Roma was really 
good a long time ago, but not good now.”

According to a retail survey done by University 
Centers, 80 percent of respondents preferred 
Starbucks over other coffee shop options. UCAB 
began to consider the Starbucks option a year ago. 
However, this process was stalled by some members 
of UCAB because they felt that Starbucks did not 
meet the acceptable fair trade policy.

“We ultimately voted that Starbucks was according 

to the UCSD fair trade policy, and that it could 
alleviate the budget crisis that the University Centers 
is facing right now,” Chang said.

UCAB was assured that Starbucks will directly 
provide scholarships to students to support 
sustainability. If negotiations with Starbucks proceed 
favorably, it will be the first time University Center 
is doing a site license. Starbucks will not be a third 
party vendor renting space; rather, Starbucks will 
allow UCSD to utilize the Starbucks name but own 
the space itself. This allows all purchases to be at the 
same quality of a regular Starbucks cafe.

According to Chang, UCAB felt that Starbucks 
was a good decision: “This higher return of 
money, because the third party isn’t just keeping 
all the money, means that the University Centers 
can keep all the profits to itself and resolve the 
budget deficit.”

Negotiations for Starbucks are expected 
to finish sometime by the end of this year. 
Starbucks’ actual opening is planned for Winter 
Quarter 2015. Aside from approving the potential 
Starbucks at Cafe Roma’s current location this

SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY

New Cardiac Device Monitors Heart Rates 
The system, implanted under the skin, shocks the heart when it beats irregularly.

Three weeks ago, the UCSD 
Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center 
implanted an innovative cardiac 
device that monitors cardiac activity 
under a patient’s skin and prevents 
sudden cardiac arrest without 
requiring any heart operations. SCVC 
is an academic-based facility offering 
cardiovascular services under the 
UCSD Health System and is the first 
in the San Diego region to perform 
such a procedure. 

A 28-year-old patient, identified 
as “Amanda” due to patient 
confidentiality, was diagnosed 
with peripartum cardiomyopathy, 
a rare disorder in which women 
develop heart disease before or 
after childbirth, resulting in heart 
failure. UCSD Health System 
Director of Cardiac Transplant and 

Mechanical Circulatory Support 
Eric Adler assessed the situation and 
administered the appropriate therapy.

“When Amanda first arrived, she 
was in critical condition,” Adler 
said. “It became clear within 24 
hours that she needed emergency 
surgery or she would not survive.” 
UCSD Health System cardiothoracic 
surgeon Victor Pretorius implanted 
a left-ventricular assistance device 
that helps pump oxygen-rich 
blood throughout Amanda’s body 
to restore blood circulation and to 
keep her heart functioning. This 
procedure took four to six hours, 
longer compared to other procedures 
due to its level of complexity. 

A few days later, Amanda received 
the Boston Scientific Subcutaneous 
Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator 
System that monitors her cardiac 
activity and, if it goes into a dangerous 
rhythm, shocks the heart. This device 

was implanted under her skin and is 
commonly given to patients in case of 
sudden cardiac arrest. 

UCSD Health System Director of 
Pacemaker and ICD Service Ulrika 
Birgersdotter-Green implanted the 
S-ICD system under Amanda’s skin 
and explained the significance of 
this device.

“The S-ICD has fewer long-term 
complications,” Birgersdotter-Green 
said. The S-ICD allows for “an easier 
removal process and puts the patient 
at less risk for infection.”
As the first patient at the UCSD Health 
System to receive the S-ICD implant, 
Amanda is being monitored closely. 
Currently, she is doing well, and her 
heart is functioning normally. In case 
her situation exacerbates, she will also 
be placed on the heart transplant list.

year, University Centers opened a 
new D’lush vendor during Winter 
Quarter 2014.

D’lush, the newest addition to Price 
Center, opened on Feb. 24, 2014.  It 
serves a variety of beverages from 
caffeinated to non-caffeinated drinks 
and novelty open-faced melts and 
salads. The original idea of D’lush was 
already finalized several years back.

Chang explained that the “area was 
vacant for a very long time because 
the recession hit when we were 
looking for vendors.”

UCAB was unable to obtain a 
vendor, so when the economy 
improved, University Centers began 
looking for potential vendors.

“D’lush seems to be doing well; it 
allows students to have a variety of 
choices.” Chang said.

Another future addition to 

campus which has been planned for 
a few years is a new Mexican food 
option — Taco Villa — which will 
be located near the original Student 
Center. Additionally, the Farmer’s 
Market vendor Lemongrass has 
negotiated a contract allowing it to 
be installed in University Centers 
next to Rubio’s during the next 
academic year.

“This proposed agreement reflects 
compromise on both sides,” Lybarger 
said. The contract also “honors the 
important contributions that patient 

care technical workers make to the 
UC Health system every day.”

A recent Lybarger press release 
indicated that AFSCME 3299 
expects to continue working with 
the UC administrators to build on 

recent agreements and find more 
ways to benefit patients, students 
and the UC community.

Council Passes Transportation 
Referendum Text... Again

Greetings all! I will be taking 
over the A.S Council column. 
Unfortunately, my Wednesday class 
extends onto the meeting, causing 
me to arrive 30 minutes late.

Upon my arrival, VP Finance Sean 
O’Neal asked VP External Affairs 
Vanessa Garcia about what recently 
occurred during a TA strike in UC 
Santa Cruz.

“Twenty TA’s 
were blocking 
the street and 
were harassed 
and arrested,” 
Garcia said. “...based from pictures, 
they were clearly nonviolent and 
this is definitely a cause for concern. 
The fact that we have a strike on 
campus right now is really, really 
frightening.”

Campus-wide Senator Austin 
Peters held the floor when asking 
whether the cost will stay the same 
at $1200 or go down.

Social Sciences Senator Colin 
King responded by saying it will 
remain fairly consistent at $2000.

Having arrived 30 minutes late, I 
was extremely confused during the 
discussion on all the numbers.

Vice President of Student Life 
Linda Le motioned to approve 
the Updated Transportation 
Referendum Language, that 
originally failed with a vote of 23-1-
1 because members of A.S. left for 
no explained reason, so it did not 
meet the required quorum to pass. 
However, O’Neal reconsidered his 
vote, after members returned from 
their hiatus and moved for a second 
roll call on the Transportation 
Referenda. With a vote of 28-0-1, 
the referendum passed.

If I may be so bold, I believe 
O’Neal purposefully voted against 
the Referendum in order to 
reconsider his vote after enough A.S. 

members had returned. Who knew 
that voting against the Referendum 
would end up saving it!

Later in the meeting, tensions 
arose when Revelle Senator Soren 
Nelson questioned why many 
A.S. Council members were 
absent during the original vote on 
transportation.

“Was there a 
reason you all left 
the [Forum]?” 
Nelson said. 
“[Leaving] 
jeopardized 

something we have worked so hard 
on for so long.”

Ironically, one of the absent 
members, Physical Sciences Senator 
Sierra Donaldson, called attention to 
the lack of effort A.S. Council places 
in supporting one another.

“We should all make an effort 
to support our fellow senators,” 
Donaldson said. “I’m not trying 
to lecture you all but this is very 
important. I can be doing better and 
all of you can too.”

A.S. Council President Andy 
Buselt persuaded A.S. Council to 
vote for the transportation bill, 
while O’Neal brought attention to 
the Compton Cookout and stressed 
the importance of illustrating how 
racist it was.

“I want everyone to really 
critically think about that moment 
and the history and the context that 
the entire event was in. I highly 
encourage everyone to engage 
someone who wasn’t here and talk to 
them about it,” said O’Neal.

I wasn’t there, talk to me!
Overall, it was quite a bustling 

meeting (sarcasm included). From 
the looks of it, the Transportation 
Bill should pass — that is, if A.S. 
Council doesn’t step out for a potty 
break during the middle of it.

Union Plans to Continue Negotiating Labor Rights with UC
▶ AFSCME, from page 1

Yan  Gao    YaG016@ucsd.edu 

Graduate students serving as 
teaching assistants are leading an 
ongoing strike at all UC campuses 
on April 2 and 3. The International 
Union, United Automobile and 
Aerospace and Agricultural 
Implement Workers of America 
organized the strike to eliminate the 
18-quarter limit imposed on TAs — 
which requires graduate students to 
complete their Ph.D. research within 
18 quarters — and reduce class sizes.

In response to the strike, the UC 

management is requesting workers 
to report the names of the people 
participating in the strike.

According to the UAW, this strike 
is in response to the Nov. 20 strike 
during which UC management 
illegally harassed and intimidated 
workers. The UAW also claimed 
that the UC system “illegally used 
surveillance during strike action, 
including filming of strikers 
on some campuses by UC Police 
Department.”

Prior to the strike, the UAW 
already reported these incidents to 
the state and filed Unfair Labor 

Practices charges against the UC 
system.

TAs are now picketing around the 
UCSD campus with their slogan, 
“Students At Work Is United, We 
Will Never Be Divided.”
Whether the UC management will 
follow through with the demands 
of the TAs is still in speculation. 
At UCSD, the picket line will be 
at Gilman and Library Walk from 
8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, 
April 3.

The strikers can now put their picket signs away as the University of California and 
the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees 
3299 finally came to a long-awaited 
agreement.

After two years of unsuccessful 
negotiations, strikes and univer-
sity protests, the UC system and 
AFSCME 3299 were able to settle 
a four-year contract that will posi-
tively benefit 13,000 UC patient 
care technical workers. The new 
Patient Technical Care Worker con-
tract will ultimately improve work-
ers’ compensation, working condi-
tions and job security and will be 
considered binding through 2017. 
The drafted agreement received 
almost completely unanimous 
approval — a 99 percent approval 
vote — from the AFSCME 3299 
union for ratification, leaving both 
parties amicable and ready to get 
back to work.

Though these changes have 
undoubtedly taken a long time, 
we’re glad that both sides are now 
willing to communicate and create 
a successful compromise after so 

much acrimonious volleying back 
and forth. The long, drawn-out 
negotiations were becoming a sore 
topic that had ramifications for 
both the UC medical systems’ and 
campuses’ finances and their ability 
to provide quality health care.

The conflict had also started to 
leak into students’ lives. AFSCME’s 
24-hour November strike in Fall 
2013 garnered enough sympathy 
to rouse the UC Student-Workers 
union UAW 2865 in a show of soli-
darity, as teaching assistants, read-
ers and graduate student instruc-
tors marched together with patient 
care and service workers. Beyond 
attracting a great deal of attention, 
the addition of sympathetic unions 
in these support strikes disrupted 
students’ schedules and cut pre-
cious hours of class out of a quarter 
system that is already desperately 
short on time.

In the future, we hope that the 
UC system will be more receptive 
to change before the strike card gets 
played. It’s worth noting that this is 
the second strike this year that the 
UC system has successfully avoided 
by offering tentative contracts. 

Just last month, the University of 
California avoided another five-day 
AFSCME strike set for March 3 
through March 7 that would have 
cost the system $10 million daily 
in lost revenues and wages for 
replacement temporary workers. 
That was until the UC system, in 
a rather familiar action, managed 
to negotiate a tentative agreement 
on a four-year contract. Evidently, 
these talks ended unsatisfactorily, 
and this time around, workers 
threatened a five-day strike start-
ing March 24. This threat stood 
until the University of California 
once again averted disaster with 
one more, hopefully final, contract 
negotiation. 

After the long, two-year stale-
mate between the AFSCME and the 
UC system — threats of emergency 
layoffs countered with threats of 
strikes and so on — we are hoping 
that this compromise can put an 
end to the standoff. We are opti-
mistic that this will be a lasting 
settlement and that the UC system 
and AFSCME can maintain com-
mon ground for future productivity 
and understanding.

Rolling Changes

UCSD transportation infrastructure upgrades are a good response to
student feedback but campus needs further improvements.

You Do,
Just Get 
Your News

lauren  koa  lkoa@ucsd.edu
technically
 speaking

In my search for summer intern-ships, one of the questions I dread being asked is what pub-
lications I read regularly. Coming 
from the Bay Area, I mention the 
San Francisco Chronicle instead of 
the Los Angeles Times and usually 
immediately see the judgment in 
my prospective employer’s eyes. But 
in all honesty, it might not matter. 
With so many articles read and 
stories shared and trending on all 
of my social media platforms, it’s 
really getting difficult for me to 
keep track of where I’m actually 
getting all of my news.

While it may sound unprofes-
sional to lack a go-to response when 
asked what publications you read, it’s 
not the end of the world if you say 
you have a variety of online sources 
to stay informed. In reality, it’s much 
better to find a consistent way of 
your own to be in the loop, even if it’s 
not an esteemed news source.

If you are not a New York Times 
subscriber but have exceeded your 
freebie online article limit and 
refuse to pay for news that “you 
can get for free,” there are plenty of 
other similar and accessible news 
articles on the Internet. Online-
only sources like Twitter and Reddit 
are already commonly accepted 
sites, while others like Buzzfeed and 
even Facebook are trying catch up 
in pace through increasing share-
able content and visibility of trend-
ing topics.

Surprisingly, I’ve found that 
in some instances, my Facebook 
news feed spreads news and tells 
people what’s happening faster than 
Yahoo! or even my AP Mobile app. 
Whether it’s a story on a Pinkberry 
founder beating up a hobo, How 
I Met Your Mother spoilers or 
updates on the missing Malaysia 
Airlines Flight 370, my Facebook 
friends regularly keep me up-to-
date with what’s going on. And 
though UCSD Confessions is usu-
ally just a page to get a quick laugh, 
a few weeks back it had prob-
ably gotten UC students riled up 
about the proposed amendment to 
California’s Proposition 209 more 
effectively than had any op-ed pub-
lished by professional newspapers.

While I’m not telling you to 
accept every “10 Ways to Know 
He’s the One” article shared by your 
friends as news or even as hard fact, 
some blog posts are great starting 
points to grab your attention to 
learn about bigger, serious issues. 
And though there’s something 
that seems really mature and adult 
about a literate college student 
elegantly sipping an espresso while 
opening up an issue of the Times 
at Starbucks, this is probably only 
because they’re about as rare to find 
as an S spot in Pangaea.

Lying in an interview or even 
in casual conversation will only 
lead to further judgment and blank 
stares as soon as someone tries to 
start a conversation about presiden-
tial candidates or any kind of for-
eign diplomacy. To avoid the drama 
and embarrassment, just make it a 
point to get your news the best way 
you can and stay informed. And if 
you really hate reading, there’s the 
10 o’clock news, where you can sit 
back and watch without having to 
do any work at all.

We’ve certainly made our fair share of complaints regarding the transportation system at UCSD, but we applaud last month’s improvements to the 
bike infrastructure surrounding the campus and the digital 
upgrades installed in the Gilman Parking Structure. Now, 
we’re crossing our fingers that the recent progress signals a 
wider increase in the administration’s response to student 
feedback and a decisive move towards a more commuter-
friendly campus.

As an extension of UCSD’s 2012 Bike and Pedestrian 
Master Plan, the new modifications to Gilman Drive have 
made bicycle commuting on campus a whole lot easier. The 
changes include implementing shared lanes that bikes are 

entitled to use and inserting pressure sensors into road sur-
faces so that bicycles can trigger green lights just as cars do. 
Given the planning commission’s ambitious goal of doubling 
bike commuting by 2017, these improvements are certainly a 
step in the right direction.

Additionally, the Gilman Parking Structure now features 
an electronic display that lists the number of open spots 
available. Ultimately, this should save drivers the headache 
of prowling through the lot looking for somewhere to park 
and should help cut down on all the vehicle emissions asso-
ciated with it. 

There are also several changes in the pipeline that look 
promising. UCSD MOVES, the commission that is respon-



sible for driving much of the process, 
indicated a forthcoming bridge over 
Gilman Drive and the Interstate 5 
that would give students another 
route to housing and malls east of 
campus. The bike-sharing program 
also looks to be expanded alongside 
new bike repair stations. With so 
much student frustration over the 
fiasco that is campus parking, it is 
good to see that some steps are being 
taken to alleviate commuter con-
cerns, even if they are incremental. 

That said, there’s still a lot more 
progress to be made in solving 
the broader transportation issues. 
We speak for most students when 
we say that we’re sick of having to 
constantly renew our bus stick-
ers. Additionally, a transit pass that 
includes expanded access to both 
the trolley and MTS bus lines would 
be an excellent resource. This would 
open more convenient travel pos-
sibilities for getting around in down-
town San Diego and allow students 
to explore the city that they all too 
often feel isolated from.

Campus planners should also 
continue to make progress on 
improving bicycle infrastructure. 
If students are receiving tickets for 
riding their bikes on Library Walk, 
then riders should have a viable 
alternative, like that at UC Santa 
Barbara or UC Davis. Those cam-
puses have impressive, intricate bike 
path systems which allow students 
to get around efficiently on campus. 
Having seen the changes that can 
be implemented when the powers 
that be choose to get around to it, 
we’re eager to find out what types of 
improvements are possible with both 
administrative support and the back-
ing of the student body.

There are of course many real-
istic problems with the funding 

source for all of these ambitious 
projects—they don’t pay for them-
selves. Hopefully, A.S. Council can 
make a renewed effort in convinc-
ing students to vote ‘yes’ on the 
referendum and approve the justifi-
able, yet modest fee increase that 
will ultimately help realize all of 
these projects. The inevitable con-
cerns about costs are reasonable, 
but students must realize that this 
small fiscal burden pales in com-
parison to the problems that would 
arise if the referendum doesn’t pass. 
Although not all might immedi-
ately see the need for just another 
student fee, the ill effects of a failed 
referendum will become apparent if 
Transportation and Parking Service 
comes to a grinding halt.

Lastly, there must be an end to 
service cuts and reductions. As it is, 
throngs of students stand in unrea-
sonably long lines in the unlikely 
hope of boarding a packed bus and 
arriving to class on time. 

If students end up putting down 
money to improve and increase 
their access to transportation, there 
is no reason that shuttle services 
or even MTS buses should be cut. 
Instead, Council should work with 
the administration to restore or even 
expand bus routes so that students 
can focus on getting an education, 
not on whether or not they will be 
able to make it to class. 

Through the recent campus 
modifications, the administra-
tion and student leadership has 
demonstrated an interest in find-
ing solutions to the transportation 
issue and implementing them. This 
change is both encouraging and 
commendable. However, if we want 
real long-term progress, we need to 
continue pushing for more reforms 
that will enable easy commuting 
and make traveling throughout 
campus easy and effective.

LA JOLLA INSTITUTENOTICE OF PREPARATION
DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT

CENTER FOR NOVEL THERAPEUTICS

The University of  California is the Lead Agency for the Center for 
Novel Therapeutics (CNT) project and will prepare a focused 

environmental impact report (EIR) to evaluate the environmental effects 
of  project implementation.  The CNT project would promote creation 

of  new personalized therapeutics through research conducted by 
University of  California San Diego (UCSD) investigators and private 
sector collaborators in shared space. The CNT project would include 
the design and construction of  an approximately 120,000 gross square 

foot (GSF) building within the UCSD Science Research Park (SRP). 
The 30-acre SRP is located at the eastern edge of  the campus just west 
of  Regents Road, and was graded in 2002 to create five building pads 
(650,000 GSF total).  Utilities and infrastructure were also installed at 

that time to support the planned build out scenario.  CNT would be the 
second building to locate in the SRP.  The CNT is envisioned as a three 
story structure that would include one level of  underground parking and 
is identified as Building Lot #4 in the SRP Design Concept.  Lot #4 is a 
graded pad and is clear of  all native vegetation. Utility connections are 
locally available in the SRP.  The project site includes Building Lots #2 
and #3 which would be paved as surface parking lots until such time as 
a building program for those lots is identified.  The project would seek 
to achieve Leadership in Energy Efficient Design Platinum rating from 

the U.S. Green Building Council.

In compliance with the State and University of  California guidelines for 
implementation of  the California Environmental Quality Act, this 

notice is hereby provided to inform the public that the University of  
California, San Diego is preparing a Draft Tiered EIR on the 

above-named project.  The Notice of  Preparation can also be viewed at 
http://physicalplanning.ucsd.edu/environmental/pub_notice.html 

The public scoping period for the Draft EIR will extend from 
March 28, 2014 to April 28, 2014.  Any comments regarding the 

scope and content of the project EIR should be directed to 
Catherine Presmyk, UCSD Physical & Community Planning, 

9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA  92093-0074.

THINGS THAT HAVE
CHANGED AT UCSD SINCE 2010
#ThrowBackThursday with the Guardian
Written by Madeline Mann
Designed by Zoe McCracken

UCSD MEMES, CONFESSIONS AND 
SNAPS DIDN’T EXIST

Instead of these Facebook pages, 
we had “Like-a-Little,” a website where 
people would anonymously post about 
cute people around campus. You’d fill 
in their gender, hair color, location and 
a comment about them. Now with a 
central place for UCSD inside jokes 
and strange confessions, the approach 
is less creepy and more of a dialogue. 
Our Confessions page is so hoppin’ 
that students from other schools fol-
low it to liven up their newsfeeds. 

CLICS WAS THE FAVORITE, 
24-HOUR STUDY SPACE

CLICS library once stood where 
Galbraith Hall is now and was, dare I 

say, the most popular spot to study for finals 
prior to its closing in 2011. A.S. Council’s “Save 

Our Libraries” campaign garnered a lot of student 
support to keep CLICS open but ultimately went 

unanswered by administration. Students responded 
by breaking into CLICS during finals week of Fall 

2011 and reclaiming it as a student-run study 
space. It was a triumphant time in undergrad 

history but was still met with an official 
closing that winter break. 

UCSD HAD THE OPTION TO 
MOVE TO DIVISION-I SPORTS

In 2012, students had the opportu-
nity to boost UCSD’s reputation and 
athletic prowess when the Division-I 

referendum was introduced that March. 
UCSD dominates Division-II sports and is the 

largest Division-II school in the country, so 
the move only seemed logical that we would 

join the ranks of our Division-I neigh-
bors, including six of the UC campus-

es. Yet students voted it down, and 
it’s still a sore subject among the 

referendum’s supporters. 

TUITION HAS GONE UP

Every undergraduate student pays 
at least $2,500 more annually to at-

tend UCSD than they did in 2010. I know, 
it hurts. It’s because every student fee has 

increased since then, except for the University 
Center fee. Yet every two years, there is a proposed 

referendum to increase the University Center 
fee, and students fortunately failed the refer-

endum in 2009, 2011 and 2013. The worst 
fee increase has to be the mandatory 

health insurance, which was $290 in 
2010 to the current $484. 

STUDENTS SMOKED 
HOOKAH ON THE ERC GREEN

Before the smoking ban on all UC schools took place this 
year, students could smoke hookah on the picnic tables 

as long as they were at least 40 feet from the building. 
It was nice to look out on the green and see a table of 

giggling freshmen learning how to blow O’s. Now 
students tape over their fire detectors and puff 

in their apartments — the proof is in the burn 
marks on the university-owned tables and 

carpeting. 

GREEK CHAPTERS 
PERFORMED SERENADES

Serenades are a long-standing tradition in UCSD Greek 
life, where every fraternity and sororities’ new pledge 

class learn high energy dances and visit chapter meetings to 
perform them. The whole spectacle involves matching outfits, 

audience participation, crude humor — it was overwhelm-
ingly people’s favorite part of meeting. But by decree of the Greek 
Advisor, the tradition ended in winter of 2013, leaving every pledge 

class since then without a proper introduction.

BACK TO SCHOOL DANCE 
WAS ON SUN GOD LAWN

Just as Sun God Festival originated 
on Sun God lawn, the largely attended 

“Back to School Dance” raged under the 
arch until last year. It was pretty amazing 

energy focused in the center of campus (if we 
have a center), with the DJ stage set up di-
rectly under the dramatically lit Sun God 

statue. Now the dance is annexed to 
RIMAC field, and I’m pretty sure 

only ERC students are stoked 
about it. 

STUDENTS WERE 
ANGRY ABOUT THE 

FALLEN STAR ART PIECE

While the Fallen Star is a whimsical 
place for underclassmen to show their 

visiting friends, it is a source of contention 
for those students in 2011 who saw it as a waste 
of taxpayer money. Though the piece did use 

$90,000 from taxes, the majority of the funds 
were from private donations, bringing the 

total to $1.3 million. No one can stay 
mad at an adorable, miniature house, 

so much of the contention has 
dissolved into mild amuse-

ment. 

GRAFFITI HALL EXISTED

The wound is still fresh on the 
shutdown of Graffiti Hall, which 

happened in September of 2013 when 
administration painted over the graffiti 
in the Mandeville stairways and installed 

seven security cameras. It was a place of 
free expression and a popular spot to 

bring campus visitors — eliminat-
ed due to the assumption that 

graffiti in the hall would lead 
to graffiti elsewhere and 

other illegal activity. 

THE FOOD HAS CHANGED

In 2010, Pines wasn’t built yet — it was Sierra 
Summit prior to 2009, and then was completely 

redone to be the dining hall we know today. Then 
in January of 2012 UCSD saw its first vegan dining 

hall built under Pines and playfully named it Roots. 
There used to be a Tacone in PC, which sold wraps and 

sandwiches until Panda Express expanded to replace it. Cafe 
Roma is to be replaced by Starbucks, and D’lush is in the 

corner where we had never seen anything built before. 
Cafe Ventanas was actually one of the best dining 

halls in 2010, and we were here to witness the 
rise and fall of Ocean View Terrace’s all-you-

can-eat buffet style dining, which began 
in the fall of 2012, only to conclude the 

following year in the fall.

Katie Herzig is an advertiser’s dream art-ist. Quirky, indie musician? Check. Cute but not-too-twee vocals? Check. Catchy, 
artsy, acoustic sounds? Check, check, check. So 
it comes as no surprise that Herzig is the artist 
you’ve heard of without ever knowing a single 
song title: Her songs have been in everything 
from Dove Chocolate commercials, ITV adver-
tisements over the Pond and even the trailer for 
“Saving Mr. Banks.”

The latter took a snippet from 
Herzig’s ethereal single, “Lost 
and Found,” off of her previous 
album. That LP, “The Waking 
Sleep,” was a great departure 
from Herzig’s typical, folk fare, 
which has included The Duhks’ 
Grammy-nominated, alt-country 
hit “Heaven’s My Home” in 2007; 
instead, her late mother’s long 
battle with cancer inspired the 
2011 offering as a deeply emo-
tional and personal, dream-pop 
work of art. Herzig set a high 
bar for herself and followed up 
on her genre crossover with this year’s “Walk 
Through Walls.” Unfortunately, the album does 
just that — walks through walls, not shoots 
through the ceiling and improve upon her 
older discography.

From the start, Herzig reasserts her depar-
ture from folk by kicking off “Walls” with the 
electronica track “Frequencies.” It’s a weak, 
uninspired tune and doesn’t make for a strong 
beginning, and the fact that the song’s first, sev-
eral measures sound too much like knock-offs 
from a semi-professional YouTube makeup tuto-
rial doesn’t help. Though thankfully many of the 
other tracks have more interesting and varied 
beats, the second half of the album is still largely 

forgettable. The song “Summer” sonically bor-
rows so much from “Lost and Found,” as if trying 
to carry over her last album’s success, that one 
wonders whether it was actually a leftover that 
was unable to make it into “The Waking Sleep.”

Unsurprisingly for Herzig, there are still a 
few saving graces in “Walls.” The album’s latest 
single “Drug” is without a doubt the best 
track on the album, sounding very much 

like ABBA with synthe-
sizers and stylophones. 
Although not quite as 
earworm-inducing, “Your 
Side” is another strong 
point in the album with 
its artistically crafted 
beats, not unlike those 
that gave The Postal 
Service and Au Revoir 
Simone their credibility 
in the electronica world. 
And in contrast to her 
quieter folk pop, the 
album offers Herzig a 
greater chance to show 

off her vocal range as a soprano akin to fel-
low, dream-pop musician Imogen Heap.

The greatest pitfall with Herzig delving 
deeper into new musical territory is that the 
very nature of electronica tends to sacrifice 
poetic lyrics — her strong point — for the 
sake of repetitious wenough of the songwrit-
er’s literate poignancy, but it gives a glimpse 
of Herzig’s potential to revolutionize electron-
ica into a more intelligent genre, should she 
continue exploring her more technologically 
savvy sounds.

Within six short years, the Marvel 
Cinematic Universe has accomplished 
more than a few feats worthy of its 
superheroes. What used to be a fickle, 
campy genre gained newfound cred-
ibility as high-quality, entertaining 
action even for those outside the 
comic book fanbase.

And then there’s the matter of how 
brilliantly each film’s entire tone cap-
tured the complexity of its respective 
protagonist: like Tony Stark, the “Iron 
Man” trilogy was edgy and witty; 
“The Incredible Hulk” had all the 
intensity and self-consciousness of its 
lead; and “Thor” and its sequel were 

as lighthearted and playfully hammy 
as the God of Thunder himself. But 
let’s not forget how “Captain America: 
The First Avenger,” with its straitlaced 
period charm, and our favorite shield-
wielding super soldier both take 
themselves very seriously. Its follow-
up “The Winter Soldier” follows suit, 
doubling as a political thriller and a 
superhero movie. At a certain point, 
however, its weightier matters go over 
the limit, ultimately feeling force-fed 
and far-fetched.

The storyline is a field day for con-
spiracy theorists more than for comic 
book aficionados. After the events of 
“The Avengers,” Steve Rogers (Chris 
Evans) — Cap’s more mundane alter-
ego — is learning to adjust in the 
21st century ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. 
defrosted him from 70-year-old ice. 
In between catching up with the 
times, Steve works to save lives with 
S.H.I.E.L.D. alongside fan favorites 
Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and 
Natasha Romanoff, also known as 
the Avengers’ Black Widow (Scarlett 

Johansson). But the beloved intel-
ligence agency we’ve seen grow into a 
formidable power over the past, eight 
movies has some nefarious motives up 
its sleeve, infiltrated by both old and 
new enemies. Needless to say, what 
good is left in S.H.I.E.L.D. turns to 
Cap’s help, but the malevolent pres-
sures threatening to tear apart the 
agency put Steve’s moral center to 
the test.

The audience is thrown into an 
unconvincing conspiracy with the 
force a vibranium shield, making 
Cap’s universe appear overrun by mil-
lions of psychopaths. Because of this, 
there is surprisingly little room left 
for the eponymous Winter Soldier. 
Compromised and brainwashed by 
Cap’s enemies into a ruthless killing 
machine, the Winter Soldier turns out 
to be Steve’s best friend Bucky Barnes 
(Sebastian Stan). Dramatic, excit-
ing and touching moments abound 
as Steve attempts to reconvert him, 
but the latter tends to skitter in only 
during the most climactic moments, 

leaving a lot of questions about him 
unanswered.

 Aside from the problematic script, 
which clumsily takes more than a few 
pages from the “Bourne” series, the 
movie has plenty of redeeming quali-
ties — this is a Marvel film, after all. 
Perhaps the reason that the storyline 
suffers is because the action scenes 
are where all the punches are (no 
pun intended). It’s no surprise that 
a great deal of the film’s marketing 
took place in conjunction with the 
Sochi Olympics: Every shot in fight 
sequences and car chases captures 
the intensity and peerless athleticism 
that made “The Avengers” so elec-
trifying. There’s also still an element 
of typical Marvel humor here: Black 
Widow deadpans effortlessly, and 
recent veteran Sam Wilson, a hero 
in his own right as Falcon (Anthony 
Mackie), carries much of the film’s 
comic relief.

More importantly, this is the film 
that proves Cap is more than just 
a guy with a shield — he can with-
stand anything, both physically and 
morally. With today’s cynicism, it 
can be difficult to grasp that such a 
hero is, in the bigger picture, a rep-
resentation of the good ol’ U.S. of A. 
Perhaps the unrealistic conspiracies 
that abound in “The Winter Soldier” 
are a way to console us that we have 
the power to withstand the evils in 
society. All in all, the loose ends left 
by the end of the film — however 
frustrating for those who prefer 
some more closure — make the 
movie more of a transitional piece 
than anything. Touted as “The 
Avengers 1.5,” a direct lead-in for 
next year’s “Age of Ultron,” the film 
does ramp up the anticipation for 
the last flick of Marvel’s Second 
Phase. Let’s hope, then, that “The 
Winter Soldier” is simply asking 
the questions that will be answered 
in 2015.

WEEKEND T H E  U C S D  G U A R D I A N  |  T H U R S D AY,  A P R I L  3 ,  2 0 1 4  |  W W W. U C S D G U A R D I A N . O R G  9

“Divergent” tells the story of 
Beatrice “Tris” Prior (Shailene 
Woodley), who lives in a post-
apocalyptic Chicago divided into 
five factions based on their virtues. 
Each year, sixteen-year-olds take 
an aptitude test to see which virtue 
they express the most. When Tris 
is labeled Divergent — a “threat 
to the system” as the movie inces-
santly tells us — she transfers to a 
faction for the brave in an effort to 

hide her identity. There, she discov-
ers what makes being Divergent so 
dangerous and why faction leader 
Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet) is 
insistent on eradicating them: They 
aren’t susceptible to brainwashing.

With so much background 
information, it’s difficult to imag-
ine how director Neil Burger 
(“Limitless”) can seamlessly inte-
grate it into the film without over-
doing it. Unfortunately, he merely 

sandwiches the extensive details in 
an awkward, tacky voiceover done by 
Woodley at the start of the film.

As if we didn’t already under-
stand that Divergents threaten the 
utopian society, the movie cease-
lessly hammers the fact into our 
brain. Despite possessing so much 
potential as a villain, Winslet’s role as 
the manipulative Jeanine is reduced 
to a cheap plot device that relays the 
same message: Divergents are dan-
gerous. For a character that is built 
up to be evil, Matthews seems to be 
quite harmless.

Furthermore, the film focuses 
too much on the romance between 
Tris and Four (Theo James); all 
other characters become underde-
veloped. Even Miles Teller — who 
gave such a charismatic perfor-
mance in “The Spectacular Now” as 
a similarly mischievous character 
— could not salvage his shallow role 
of Peter, Tris’ bully. Four is watered 
down to a stereotypical love inter-
est, complete with a tough exterior 
and cheesy lines. Gone are his 
gentle masculinity and witty banter 

from Veronica Roth’s novel — even 
with the amount of effort James 
puts in. 

On top of the superficial char-
acters, the soundtrack — ranging 
from Ellie Goulding to Chance 
the Rapper — distracts the viewer 
from fully immersing themselves in 
the film’s universe. Pivotal scenes 
(such as when Tris first enters the 
Choosing Ceremony) are overshad-
owed by unfitting power ballads. 
Burger essentially hasn’t decided 
what kind of movie he wanted 
“Divergent” to be.

Either way, viewers will appreci-
ate Woodley’s explosive performance 
as Tris. Woodley bestows Tris with 
a vulnerability that doesn’t under-
cut her heroism. From her internal 
struggle about abandoning her fam-
ily to her fear of being murdered 
because she is Divergent, Woodley’s 
portrayal is nuanced and com-
manding. While her husky voice 
cracks and trembles at times you 
don’t expect, she doesn’t oversell 
it. Woodley has some of the most 
expressive eyes, compelling audienc-

es to root for her despite the over-
abundance of cliches “Divergent” 
drags along. Regardless how one-
dimensional the supporting cast 
is — namely Tris’ parents (Ashley 
Judd and Tony Goldwyn) — when 
Woodley interacts with them, she 
sparks them alive. Rather than feel-
ing for a character because of the 
script and the respective actors, 
audiences empathize with them 
because of Woodley.

Ultimately, the thinly veiled 
metaphor of individuality is lost 
through the super-saturation of 
romantic tropes and the direc-
tor’s inability to be more creative. 
Thankfully, Burger did succeed in 
one thing: setting up the world of 
“Divergent” for potential sequels.  
Much like the fenced-in Chicago 
represented in the film, he has 
not left much room for the series 
to grow in artistry or originality, 
confining the franchise to hinge on 
appealing to the masses.

With the door closed, it looks 
like your typical restaurant, but 
with it opened — and all its local 
band stickers showing — Pokez 
shows its true, edgy colors. 

Were the walls of Pokez naked, 
the restaurant would be a simple 
room covered in dark wood. 
Instead, Pokez has cool art, like 
the painting of a blue dragon and a 
half-naked mannequin in women’s 
underwear atop a garbage can. The 
open door and big windows make 
the perfect breeze especially for a 
hot day. To be honest, it kind of 

looks like a dive on the outside, 
but inside, you can tell it’s a Gen-Y, 
20-something’s restaurant — hip-
sters and cheap veg-friendly food. 

Like in any good, Mexican res-
taurant, the waiter brings chips and 
salsa when he brings you the menu. 
As someone who’s a little gun-shy 
when it comes to spice, the salsa 
has a bit of a punch to it. However, 
it’s worth the burn because it’s the 
perfect texture — not too watery 
— and right amount of kick in the 
tomato-y aftertaste. 

Although the interior decor says 
alternative, Pokez bases its menu 
on traditional, Mexican cuisine — 
with perhaps more emphasis on 
tofu than carne asada. Almost all of 

the items on Pokez’s menu can be 
prepared vegetarian and some can 
also be vegan. The dishes that come 
with meat can easily be substituted 
with tofu per request. In fact, many 
of Pokez’s dishes come prepared 
vegetarian such as the Chile Relleno 
($4.25) prepared with chile peppers 
stuffed with cheese and ranchero 
sauce. The spicy Enchiladas Suiza 
($8.00) can be made with chicken 
or tofu, and with green sauce, red 
chiles, cheddar cheese, onions and 

sour cream. The sour cream helps 
to tone down the zing in the green 
sauce — or if you nix dairy, just 
push the beans and rice on top, and 
that will take the edge off. 

There’s also the opportunity to 
test out different flavorings with 
different fillings in many dishes. 
Try any one of their combos for 
a variety such as combo number 
six ($9.75), which is one cheese 
enchilada and any two tacos choos-
ing from tofu, potato, chicken or 

beef. Take Pokez up on its “frenchie 
style,” which is just a dollar more, 
where you put French fries under 
any item you order. It’s an easy way 
to make two meals out of one.

Just like the outward typical 
restaurant look and edgy inside, the 
food at Pokez is a seamless pairing 
of traditional Mexican food and 
vegetarian options at a great price.

DIVERGENT

the Matadors. Senior outside hitter 
Nick Iorfino returned to the court 
after over a month-long absence 
and contributed a match-high 18 
kills. 

UCSD opened the match with 
little energy, as the Matadors took 
an early 4–0 lead and ultimately 
overran the Tritons throughout the 
set to win 25–14. 

However, the Tritons bounced 
back quickly, taking the next two 
sets by scores of 25–19 and 25–22. 
UCSD largely controlled an early 
lead in the second set and held 
on for a victory in the third set 
despite Cal State Northridge’s late 
comeback attempt. 

In spite of the 2–1 set lead, the 
tide shifted in the Matadors’ favor 
in the fourth set. The Tritons held 
a commanding 10–4 lead until 
Cal State Northridge shifted the 
momentum with a 13–4 run that 

included three straight service aces. 
The Matadors would hold on to 

their slim lead to knot up the match 
at 2–2. 

“[There was] a still fair amount 
of game left, but [we were] in a nice 
position, and we quickly gave that 
lead away,” Ring said. 

In the fifth set, UCSD kept Cal 
State Northridge within close reach, 
with the final contest containing 
three lead changes and five tie scores. 
However, the Tritons ultimately failed 
to close out the set in a 15–12 loss. 

“We’re disappointed,” Ring said. “It 
hurts to lose this one because we put 
a lot into it, and we were there to win 
it. I’m proud of their effort.”

UCSD will look to end their three-
game losing slide as it next hosts No. 
7 UC Irvine on Friday, April 4 and 
UC Merced on Saturday, April 5. 
Both games will commence at 7 p.m.

non-allergic volunteers. You must have lived in Japan for at least 5 

years. The focus of this research study is to learn how seasonal 
pollens from Japan induce allergies. We hope to better understand 

how the immune system causes allergies and why non-allergic 
people don’t get sick.

TWEET OF THE WEEK

@UCSD_Sports: Sophomore outfielder Gradeigh 
Sanchez hit a full cycle, going 5-for-6 during 
Friday’s doubleheader against Cal State East Bay 
#TritonsRising

seven-inning nightcap with his first 
career triple and was batted home 
by senior catcher Nick La Face on 
a groundout two batters later. The 
Pioneers responded by scoring three 
runs in their next at-bat, making it 
through their entire order before the 
Tritons could turnover the inning. 
UCSD earned one run in the third 
to decrease the Pioneer lead to one 
run at 3–2. 

Back-to-back singles opened the 
fourth for UCSD, and an errant 
throw off a bunt from freshman 
shortstop Tyler Howsley allowed 
sophomore Troy Cruz to score 
the tying run. Sanchez and junior 
second-baseman Erik Lewis 
produced a run batted in double 
each to give the Tritons the lead. La 
Face followed with his 25th walk 
of the year to load the bases, and 
senior outfielder Justin Rahn added 
a run off an RBI double to bring the 
score to 6–3.

The Tritons built their lead over 
the following frames to win 10–3.

“We got great starting pitching, 

but we’ve come to expect that from 
our guys,” Triton head coach Eric 
Newman told UCSD Athletics. 
“Both Donny and Trevor settled 
in and pitched well. Honestly, I 
thought Scott [Zeman] threw the 
ball well, too. We just didn’t make a 
couple of plays behind him that we 
needed to make and made things 
tough for him.”

In the first game of Sunday’s 
doubleheader, eight Pioneer errors 
allowed UCSD to rack up 17 hits and 
seven unearned runs, a season high. 
Senior right-hander Blake Fassler 
threw perfect innings in the second, 
third and fifth while only allowing 
three singles across six innings. 

Rahn scored the game’s first run 
in the second inning off of an errant 
throw. Howsley followed a few batters 
later to hit an RBI, and freshman Jack 
Larsen scored to bring the UCSD 
lead to 3–0. The Tritons increased 
their lead by one in the third inning 
after La Face hit his 10th double on 
the season.

UCSD continued to rout the 
Pioneer pitching staff throughout 
the remaining innings en route to a 

12–0 victory.
Troy Cruz, the only Triton to have 

started all 27 games, closed out the 
series on the mound by pitching a 
complete game — the third of his 
career and his second on the year — 
in Sunday’s second contest. Cal State 
East Bay was plagued with errors 
again in the final game, allowing 
the Tritons to finish the game with 
a 5–2 victory.

“We showed great tenacity at 
the plate and competitive spirit,” 
Newman said. “I’m really proud of 
the way the guys responded [after 
the way the series started].” 

UCSD hosts Cal State Los Angeles 
tonight at Triton Ballpark with the 
first pitch scheduled for 6 p.m. The 
Tritons will play four games against 
the Golden Eagles, hosting two of 
them and finishing the series in 
Los Angeles in a doubleheader on 
Saturday. Cal State Los Angeles is 
placed right behind UCSD in CCAA 
standings, making the series crucial 
for the Tritons’ postseason hopes.

skill-wise and strategy-wise.”
Scott easily won in an almost 

perfect No. 1 singles match with a 
6–1, 6–0 final score. Nowamooz and 
Asai recorded victories in the No. 
2 (6–4, 6–3) and No. 5 (6–2, 6–0) 
slots, respectively. 

In the No. 6 slot, sophomore 
Monica Yassear had a flawless win, 
defeating Cal State Stanislaus’s Katie 
Ferlmann 6–0, 6–0.

“I think [Sunday’s match] really 
helped boost confidence,” Scott 
said. “I think everyone played pretty 

solid all around.”
Now three matches into their 

seven-match road trip, UCSD will 
next travel to face Cal State Los 
Angeles on Saturday, April 5. The 
contest will begin at 11 a.m. 

“We have three weeks left in the 
season and have some key matches 
that we can win,” LaPlante said. 
“We’ve got to play with heart. We’ve 
lost as a team, and now we have to 
try to win as a team.”

Tennis Splits Against FPU, Stanislaus Tritons Fall to No. 4 CSU 
Long Beach, Northridge

WOMEN'S  TENNIS MEN'S  VOLLEYBALL 

Fresno Pacific dominates UCSD, before Tritons bounce back at Cal State Stanislaus. 

Volleyball swept 3-0 at home by Long Beach, lose 
3-2 in intense match against Cal State Northridge.This past weekend, the No. 17 

UCSD women’s tennis team suffered 
an 8–1 trouncing at the hands of 
Fresno Pacific University before 
bouncing back to defeat Cal State 
Stanislaus in a strong 7–2 victory. 
After the road split, the Tritons now 
hold an 8–12 overall record.

Facing Fresno Pacific on Saturday, 
UCSD could only muster one 
doubles win out of three, while 
falling in all six singles matches in 
straight sets. 

“[Fresno Pacific] is a very 
strong team,” UCSD head coach 
Liz LaPlante said. “They had really 
improved [from the last time we 
matched up], and they just outplayed 
us. I was very upset with how we 
performed. We have a lot of different 
reasons why we think it happened, 
but we just didn’t play well.”

In the doubles matches, senior 
Tara Vanooteghem and junior 
Laura Wilke served as the Tritons’ 
only victorious pair, defeating 
the Sunbirds’ Matilda Ackered 
and Erin Carlson 8–5. The No. 
17 nationally ranked sophomore 
Triton pair of Paula Chou and Kyra 
Scott surrendered a tough match to 
No. 18 Petra Jurova and Angelika 
Sobiecka by a score of 8–6.  

“All three matches were pretty 
close,” Scott told the UCSD 
Guardian. “Our opponents were 
just moving a little bit better than 
us. [Chou] and I were a little bit 
tentative, not being as aggressive as 
we should have been.” 

On the singles side, the Sunbirds 
appeared to overwhelm the Tritons, 
as UCSD failed to secure a single set 
victory in all six matches. 

Ranked No. 26, Scott provided 
little challenge to No. 13 Jurova in 
the No. 1 singles slot in a 6–1, 6–2 
loss. The closest match came in the 
No. 6 slot as UCSD sophomore Lisa 
Asai fell to Ackered 6–3, 6–4. 

“It was a little bit demoralizing,” 
Scott said. “I knew that we were 
losing on every court pretty much 
my entire match. I think part of it 
was that we weren’t competition-
ready. We could’ve prepared a little 
better over spring break.”

After Saturday’s defeat, the 
Tritons rebounded with a big win 
against Cal State Stanislaus to break 
their losing skid of three straight 
matches. UCSD took four out of six 
singles contests and swept all three 

of its doubles matchups. 
No. 17 Chou and Scott handily 

bested the Warriors’ McKenzy 
Harden and Jessica Laurie in the 
No. 1 doubles slot by a score of 8–1. 
Freshman pair Nava Nowamooz and 
Shannon Theisen also earned an 
8–4 victory in the No. 2 slot, while 
Vanooteghem and Wilke dominated 
in the No. 3 slot with an 8–0 win. 

“We played very aggressive,” 
LaPlante said. “The girls were 
playing with confidence because we 
knew it was a match we were going 
to win. They were able to do things 
we were working on in practice, and 
it showed how much better we were 

The UCSD men’s volleyball team 
lost 3–0 last Thursday, March 27 
against No. 4 Cal State Long Beach 
before falling again in a tough 3–2 
match versus Cal State Northridge 
on Saturday. The pair of home losses 
puts the Tritons at 2–20 overall and 
1–19 in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation. 

The Tritons were the clear 
underdogs against nationally ranked 
powerhouse Cal State Long Beach 
and were swept in three largely 
uncontested sets.

The 49ers came out of the gate 
hot, converting on 71 percent of their 
hits to take an imposing 15–5 lead in 
the first set. In their first game back 
from a two week break, the Tritons 
started the game sluggishly, hitting an 
inefficient seven kills and nine errors 
on 26 attempts. The game ended on a 

score of 25–11. 
“Even though we had three days 

of practices, you can tell we weren’t 
in match mode,” UCSD head coach 
Kevin Ring said. “We’re off for finals 
week, and that’s just the nature of 
how our season maps out with the 
quarter. That’s on us to come out 
and be better prepared right from 
the start.”

The second game finished in 
similar results with the final score 
of 24–13.

The Tritons’ only lead of the match 
came from a kill by sophomore 
outside hitter Kirill Rudenko to 
start off the third set. However, Cal 
State Long Beach would take control 
for the rest of the match, winning 
25–15.

After a one day break, the Tritons 
next hosted Cal State Northridge on 
Saturday in a hard-fought loss to

he No. 30 UCSD baseball team took a critical California Collegiate Athletic 
Association series against Cal State East Bay on March 30 on the road at 
Pioneer Ballpark. The Tritons split the first doubleheader on Friday, March 
28 and swept the final two games of the series, which  were delayed until 
Sunday due to inclement weather. The victories moved UCSD to 17–10 
overall and 13–7 in the CCAA, good for fourth place in the league. 

The Pioneers sealed game one with a walk-off victory, achieving their 
only win of the series after bringing three runners home in the bottom of 
the ninth. 

Sophomore right-hander Justin Donatella started on the mound for 
UCSD and shut out nine batters between the third and fifth innings. After 
an inning-for-inning pitching duel, Donatella’s stride was ended early in the 

sixth when his first ball thrown was hit as a leadoff double to left field. A few 
batters later, a run batted in single to center broke the tie and brought the 
score to 2–1. The Triton offense capitalized on the opportunity and drove 
in two batters over the next few innings, compared to the Pioneers’ gain of 
one, bringing the score to 4–2 at the end of the seventh.

Donatella was relieved by senior right-hander Scott Zeman in the eighth 
frame who sat down three consecutive batters. However, Zeman ran into 
trouble in the ninth after an infield error put a Pioneer on base. Zeman 
proceeded to issue a walk and surrender a single. With the bases loaded, a 
single by Tyler Buchanan two pitches later sent the winning run home for 
Cal State East Bay.

In game two, sophomore out-fielder Gradeigh Sanchez opened the
