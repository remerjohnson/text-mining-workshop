Daycare Gets Solid Endorsement 
Ford On 
Campus 
Gets Laughs, 

Ovation 
By Jocelyn Larkin 

Staff Writer 
UCSD saw former President 

Gerald R. Ford for the first 
time yesterday and campus 
reaction ranged from laughter 
as some verbal faux pas before 
a lower division political 
science - class to a standing 
ovation at Mandeville Audi-
torium. 

Ford provoked laughter 
when he called Angola "not just 
a black and white issue" and 
Joshua Nkomo, leader of 
Zimbabwe's patriotic front, "a 
guerilla in every sense of the 
word." 

Later in the day, Ford's 
categorical opposition to a 
peace-ti me draft brought 
enthusiasm from a Mandeville 
audience which gave him a 
standing ovation at the end of 
yesterday's lecture. 

Following a short statement 
outlining his objection to the 
.. im periled" role of the 
presidency and " do-everything 
Congress, " Ford opened the 
Mandeville session to students' 
questions. He fielded questions 
on such issues as American 
reponsibility in Iran, relations 
with China and inOation. 

Ford also spoke to a group of 
economic students at 11: 00 on 
the problems of inOation and 
unemployment. He condemned 
Carter's economic policies as 
inflationary and irresponsible 
and- equated Carter with "a 
driver who slams on his brakes 
on an icy slope." 

Ford recommended a 
greater emphasis on capital 
investment and a more credible 
monetary policy . 

Economics professor Rama-
chandra Ramanathan praised 
Ford for his knowledge of 
economic problems. "He had 
all the facts at his fingertips," 
he remarked. -

But Dr . David Laitin, 
professor of the political 
science class in which Ford 
spoke, commented that he

8, Jeff Beret'ont-Howe 
Associate Managing Editor 

Projections showed early this 
morning that voters have given 
their overwhelming support to 
campus daycare facilities , with 
over 75% of those voting 
supporting current or in-
creased funding for the present 
center and a slightly smaller 
percentage (65%) indicating 
that they want Registration 
fees expended to expand the 
center. 

Voters also voted strongly in 
favor of allowing faculty and 
staff children in the center, 59% 
of those casting ballots 
registering their support for 
that concept. 

Voter turnout in the election 
was heavier than expected. 2, 
508 students voted, about a 
quarter of the just over 10,000 
undergraduate , graduate a nd 
medical students eligible to 
vote. 

Only scant election returns 
were available from elections

Ford Addresses Issues 
Criticizes CIA Record, Di rector Turn~r 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Assocla&e Managing Editor 

Criticizing the CIA and its 
current director, Stansfield 
Turner , former President 
Gerald Ford addressed a wide 
variety of topics at an early 
morning press conference 
yesterday in the Chancellor's 
complex. 

"There i no question that the 
CIA and our intelligence 
community made a number of 
serious mistakes a nd didn ' t 
a dequately understand the 
undercurrents in Iran ... 
mistake that can't be 
tolerated," the Pre ident aid. 

Ford attributed the CIA's 
failures to an .. inadequate job" 

by Turner, the CIA 's director, 
adding" he is at least partially 
to blame." 

Bad pUblicity a nd low agency 
morale were also named by 
Ford as factors in the inability 
of the intelligence community 
to function properly. . 

" After the public lam-
basti ng the agency received, a 
lot of good people left ... 
morale disintegrated, and the 
agency ju t wasn 't up to 
meeting some of the problems 
in Iran," he said. 

China-Vietnam 
Ford urged the United State 

to bewaryofinvolvementin the 
burgeoning China-Vietnam 
border conflict. 

" The United States should 
keep itself at arm's length of 
the conflict, he said, and " keep 
our cool" about the Asian war, 
adding, though, that he did not 
have any classified govern-
ment information. 

Ford labeled the recent 
. events in Iran " a tragedy, " and 
defended his administration's 
support of the shah. 

"We could have done more, 
but at least we were consistent 
in our policy. We thought the 
shah was nece sary to stability 
in the middle east," he aid. 

Ford also described a 
"shocking" the decision of the 
Iranian government to expel

Guardian stratified random 
survey of 340 ballots, about 15% 
of those cast, has produced 
projections that Ran Anbar, 
Guardian News Editor and 
survey coordinator, says 
should be accurate to within 
4%, most of the possible error 
resul ting from potentially 
maccurate hand counts of the 
ballots. 

Daycare proponents and 
opponents, reached early in the 
evening yesterday when some 
official returns were available, 
were happy with the election 
results . 

" It was a victory for us," 
Victoria Brown, Committee for 
Decent Daycare Publicity 
Director said. " Students on this 
campus have shown that they 
want daycare. " 

Scott McBride of the anti-
daycare Justice in Spending 
Committee seemed reconciled 
to defeat. but was nevertheless 
pleased, noting, " we did better 
than we had expected." 

The referendum i advisory 
to the Registration Fee 
committee. Final inter-
pretation of the results , and 
therefore the decision on how 
much money the center will 
receive, rests first with the 
committee and eventually with 
the administration. 

Voting patterns varied 
across campus. Revelle and the 
gym steps polling places had 
the highest number of votes 

. cast, with Revelle offering the 
smallest degree of support to 
the center. 

Scripps and the University 
Hospital had the lowest 
turnouts, with only 16 students 
choosing to cast their ballot at 
the hospital and 54 at the 
oceanography school.

Feds After Bad Student Loans 
By Kathy Hurfer 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD students will be held more 
accountable for repayment of federal 
loans in the future as a result oC 
accelerated efforts by the Carter 
Administration to collect defaulted 
student loans. 

According to Tom Rutter, Director oC 
Financial Aid at UCSD and a member of 
an advisory body to the National 
Association of Student Financial Aid, the 
Carter Administration is now " hell-bent 
Cor leather" and " ab olut Iy dedicated" 
to retrieve unpaid tudent loan . 

"The mood of the country ," he 
explained, "i uch that people are really 
tired of putting mon y into bottomles 
pits." 

Two major federal loans are currently 
available to college tudent . The larger 

of the two, the National Direct Student 
Loan (NDSL) , _ i handled through 
individual academic institutions and 
suffers a national default rate of nearly 20 
percent, according to Health , Education 
and Welfare figures . 

The Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) , 
formerly the Federally Insured Student 
Loan, is econd. It is handled primarily 
through bank and credit union . HEW 
figure indicate the national deCault rate 
is about ten percent. 

"Sometime we get mix d up with 
compa Ion and running the program 
well ," remarked Leo Cornfelt, HEW 
Deputy Commi ioner for tudent 
Financial A i lance.

Locating former students and 
collecting unpaid loans, according to 
Rutter, are the most difficult tasks for the 
federal government. " A lot of the people 
who borrow money," be explained 
" become disconnected from ·th~ 
univer ity ... and they're gone." 

He added that the loan programs are 
expanding at an "awesome" pace and 
that in ufficient federal manpower ha 
made it difficult to keep up with the 
programs.

Opinion 

Why Your Professor Can't Write 
Reprin&ed from the 
New York Times. 

By Donald Holden 
IRVINGTON-ON-HUDSON, N.Y.-

Like most of my Criends in book 
publishing I groan when I get a thick 
package (rom a university. 

Inside the envelope, I know there's a 
manuscript from some profesor who's 
bucking for a raise. a promotion, 
tenure - a manuscript that serves no 
one but the professor himself and 
some faculty committee. 

I know that the book will be written 
in the illiterate scholar[y jargon that 
publishers (and cynical graduate 
students) call " dissertationese. " 
Because we try to give every author a 
fair hearing, my staff may spend 
hours putting the manuscript through 
its paces. But in the end, I know that 
almost certainly the book will be 
rejected. 

Publishers know that most 
professors are bad writers . The 
professor's grammar. spelling and 
punctuation are usually passable, but 
his prose is apt to be pretentious, 
unclear and chaotic. And like most 
people who write badly, he does it on 
purpose. As George Orwell points out 

in " Politics and the English 
Language," bad prose doesn't happen 
by accident: It 's a conscious attempt 
to deceive. 

Donald Holden, who pent two days 
pursuing a dOClorate in art education 
at New York University, is editorial 
director of a New York City publishing 
house that specializes in art books. 

" Dissertalionese," the standard 
lingo of doctoral dissertations, is the 
language that professo rs use to 
disgui se se lf-co nt e mpt with 
pompos ity. The scholar, who often 
spends his professional life counting 
the cats in Zanzibar, secretly knows 
that what he has to say is unimportant. 
So he inflates his diction, convolutes 
his sentences, and builds a complex 
scholarly structure (with lots of 
footnotes) to make the content sound 
important. 

Faculty committees - who grade 
him on how well he plays the academic 
game - may be impressed, but 
publishers are not. 

The publisher a lso knows that ba d 
writing usually hides (o r tries to hide) 
intellectual laziness . Every 

experienced editor can tell you the 
real purpose of tho~e turgid , 
pond e rou s se nten ces: They 're 
designed to conceal the fact that the 
writer hasn 't taken the tim e to figure 
our precisely what he wants to say . 
And why is the professor's " story line" 
so c haotic and bewildering? ot 
because his ideas are so lofty , but 
beca use he's dodged the writer's 
toughe t intellectual job - to link hi 
Cacts in a tight , logical chain. 

Even a n inexperienced editor soon 
discovers that bad academic writing 
(like political s peeches) can be a 
subtle form of lying. 

With riva l scholars watching, the 
professor may construct a vague. 
pompous sentence or a meandering 
" story . line" to a void the facts that 
don 't support his case - to bury what 
he doesn 't want to say - or to blur the 
disti nction between fact and opinion, 
between what he can prove and what 
he can' t. Academic writing is often 
just plain dishonest. 

Ba d academic writing begins in the 
graduate schools where professors-to-

be a re trained to write by the 
professors whose books we turn down . 
Doctoral programs breed bad writing 
because they fail (or refuse) to teach 
the fundamental lesson that produces 
a clear . simple , well-organized 
manuscript: the sta r of the book is not 
the writer, but the reader . . 

Good scholarly writing, like good 
teaching, isn't an ego trip - a 
monument to your intellectual 
achievements - but a service you 
perform for a stranger. To writer well , 
you must put yourself in that 
stranger's shoes and imagine that you 

·are the reader. Whether that reader is 
a scholar or a layman , your primary 
responsibility is to him. 

Professors a re fond of saying that 
the hard-earned Ph. D. is the license of 
their trade. But until doctoral 
ca nd i d ates are taught that 
responsibility to the reader is the basis 
of good writing - as responsibility to 
the student is the basis of good

Disco Defended, Guardian 'Pigignorant' 
Well , I must be absolutely 

honest from the start: very 
little can get me to pay serious 
a ttentio n to t he Triton 
Times/Guardian , much less 
actually s it down a nd write to 
their editors. Still , this is a 
chance that I can't pass up. 

Re: John Hondros ' " com-
mentary" on disco. The only 
thing I can conclude from 
Hondros' little non-essay is the 
fact that he i nothing more 
than a cultural bigot, the type of 
which one finds in a bundance at 
UCSD. I a m not Quite s ure why 
Hondros doesn ' t like di co 
music other than the fact tha t it 
disagrees with him . But then 
thi eems to be the basis for 
mostopinionsaboutart/music/ -
film/a nd/ or/c ul ture on this 
campus. 

With a little ca reful rea ding, 
we can fathom the nature of his 
compla int. Fi rst, Bob Hope 
likes disco. In other words , it 
ha universa l a ppeal. (I'm a bit 
surprised that Hondro even 
admitted that he watched Bob 
Hope 's Christmas s peciaL), 

eco nd , Mr . Hondro s is 
phy iea lly ickened by John 
Travolta. He co mplains that no 
one " drools over " him , despite 
his big lips . Well , if he talks the 
way he write. it's no wonder. 
Third. he feels that Andy Gibb's 
music ha on lyonecontribulion 
(he neve r te ll s us why): it f eds 
the dishwas her' indust ry . [n 
con ideration of these reasons 
that are per onally valid , I'm 
Sure (thi ' g ives you an idea 
a bout the exte nt of Mr . 
lIondros' ins ight) th e author 
('onc ludes that di co music. 
"Simply put." is bad. 
. Now it's my turn . Why do r 

like disco '? First. it has

Third, one doesn't have to 
belong to the " ta c ky" disco 
sr.ene to e nj oy disco. For 
insta nce, orne people (like 
me) can't stand plastic disco 
c lothes-that is, tight-knit pants 
and polyester shirts with hot 
colour lines drawn from the left 
s houlder to the right hip. I don't 
wear the "white disco look" 
either. 

I could go on, but I don ' t think 
t here's any reason. But I would 
Ii ke to point out someth ing ugly 
in Mr. Hondros' commentary . 

First of a ll , before Hondro 
attempts to write another 
article on a nything , I suggesl' 
he learn how to write . "Night 
Fever Leaves Me Sick" is 
neith er intelligent , nor 
interesting, nor witty. There is 
no exc use for it wholly 
prejudiced conte nt nor for its 
blatant lack of substa nce. Even 
worse. the l-e is no excuse for 
publishing such nons nse . Its 
publication reflects one thing 
only: the one-sided cultural 
ol'i ntation of not only Hondros, 
but of the Guardian . 

Case in point: note the record 
reviews in a nyone of the past 
issues of the Guardian this 
year . Alternative styles of 
music are rarely critiqued. 
Musically , the Guardian is in a 
rut of con e rvative. middle-
class American "progressive" 
JJZZ a nd/or Rock. Santana. 
Springst.cen, the Tubes. Elvi 
Coste llo, Ronnie Laws. Rod 
Stewart. John Lee Hooker -
the e people are certainly not 
without merit. Some of them 
and others are truly creative 
and interpretive arti t . But to 
turn away from the m rits of

con picuously missing) ; the 
Tokyo Qu a rtet, the loc a l

a n interest in at leas t · three

EPA Searching for Early 
Radioactive Dump Sites 

DENVER (AP) - The search for radioactive 
dump sites expanded from Colorado to other 
states yesterday as health officials sought to 
trace the remnants of Denver's once-bustling 
radium industry. 

Paul Smith. regional director of the 
Environmental Protection Agency. said the 
investigation into P9tentially radioactive sites 
had been broadened to include the Chicago area 
and towns in Pennsylvania. 

Meanwhile. officials, who originally had 
believed that 11 contaminated sites located in 
the Denver area contained uranium, said they 
were convinced now that the sites contained the 
significantly more dangerous radium. 

In the early 19OOs. Denver was a center for the 
processing of uranium to produce radium, 
which was then used in medical treatment. 

" The m~hinery is just getting into action," 
said Smith. " We have dooe considerable more 
literature research and alerted other areas 
potentially involved." 

One such site might exist in Chicago, Smith 
said, where tons of Colorado uranium were 

shipped between 1915 and 1920 to the Carnotite 
Reduction Co. Efforts to locate the exact site of 
the now defunct company have been 
unsuccessful, he said. 

Hundreds o{ tons of Colorado uranium were 
shipped to Pennsylvania during roughly the 
same period, Smith said, adding that the towns 
o{ Canonsburg and Landsdowne were 
previously known sites o{ radium processing. 

In the Denver area, excessive radiation levels 
have been discovered at 11 sites that served as 
disposal areas {or radioactive materials from 
radium processing. Of 38 potential sites, 16 have 
been round to be without excess radiation and 11 
remained to be checked as of yesterday, 
according to the Colorado Department of 
Health . 

None o{ the high-radiation sites presents any 
immediate health danger, but o{{icials have 
expressed concern about possible long-term 
exposure to radiation leaking from the dumps. 

" Uranium is one of the lea,s t radioactive 
substances. " said Montgomery. " Radium is 
just the opposite. It 's one o{ the worst." 

INTERNATIONAL 
USSR Brings Navy to Vietnam Coast 

Washington (AP) - Two Soviet warships have 
left the Sea of Japanand apparently areen route 
to the South China Sea off Vietnam, the 
Pentagon said yes terday. 

" We don 't know their intentions," said 
spokesman Thomas Ross. 

It was apparent, however, that the Soviet light 
cruiser and frigate, accompanied by an oiler, 
may be headed to reinforce eight other Russian 
naval vessels strung out along the coast of 

Vietnam. 
The Russians have some 43 divisions, backed 

up by heavy airpower, deployed along the China 
border, as has been the case for about a decade 
during which the two Communist giants have 
been quarreling. 

Ross said there have been no indications o{ 
any Soviet troop alerts along that border since 
the Chinese sent forces into Vietnam last 
weekend.

BAL HARBOUR, Fla. (AP) - The AFL-CIO said yesterday it 
would go to court to try to have President Carter's wage-price 
guidelines declared illegal on grounds that they are actually 
mandatory, not voluntary. 

Federation president George Meany said the guidelines are 
mandatory because of threatened penalties against companies 
that do not comply with the program. Mandatory wage-price 
controls are prohibited by law, he said. 

The suit, which AFL-CIO officials said would be filed in federal 
court in Washington as soon as possible, will pose a major legal 
challenge to a central plank of Carter's anti-inflation campaign. 

STATE 
Convention Proposal Loses 

SACRAMENTO (AP) - A Democrat-controlled Assembly 
committee dealt a stinging setback to Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. 
yesterday by rejecting a proposal for a constitutional convention 
to draft a federal balanced-budget amendment. 

The 8-12 Ways and Means Committee vote on a Brown-backed 
resolution was a victory for Assembly Speaker Leo McCarthy (D-
San Francisco) in a high-pressure lobbying battle with the 
Democratic governor. 

The vote came after three lengthy hearings stretching over four 
weeks and virtually nonstop campaigning on both sides -
busi nc s and farm groups joining Brown to boost the proposal.

AS Calls For Campus 
Vending Machine Boycott 

By J eff Beresford-Howe 
Associate Managing Editor 

When campus workers a nd 
students go to drop their change 
into the ca mpus vending 
machines later this qua rter, 
they just may find pickets, . 'out 
of order" signs or students 
offer ing alternatives to the 
machines. 

At least , that's what will 
happen if the AS gets its way . 

The AS Council approved a 
resolution Wednesday ca lling 
Cor a boycott of campus vending 
machines during the ninth 
week of this quarter. The 
purpose of the boycott, as 
described by the Council 
resolutio n, is to protest 
Chancellor William McElroy's 
decision last summer to 
tra ns fer vending machine 
funds from the colleges to 
Housing and Food Services. 

The AS claims that the switch 
was made without student 
cons ultation and without 
regard for the " necessity" of 
colleges to have a "sta ble 
fu nding resource. " The 
resolution also charges the 
administration with a lack of 
respect for the colleges. 

In addition to the boycott, the 
AS resolution calls for the 
Council to " seek to contract 
their own vending machines for 
all UCSD areas," excluding 
those areas patronized mainly 
by staff. 

Na ncy Laga, AS Revelle 
Representative and leader of 
the Council task forcc that 
proposed the vending machille 
bo ycott , sai d th a t the 
admi nistration gets $2600 a 
wee k Crom the vending 
machines, and that the boycott, 
if effective, would serve notice 
to the a dminis trator s th at 
students are a force with which 
the a dmini s tra tion mu s t 
reckon. 

Some Council m e mbers 
worried about the boycott's 
effectiveness . " What if it 
fails ?" Activity Fee Chairman 
Jim Atkins said, " we ' ll have 
lost a ll our leverage with the 
administration ... 

Other Council members were 
worried about organizing the 
boycott. Recalling past mass 
action failures of the Council , 
including the a borted Ba nk of 
America fund withdrawal 
earlier this quarter, Carlos 
Montalvo, Public Relations 
CommiSSioner, told the Council 
" organization is the key to 
ma~ing this boycott work ... 
everyone on the Council is 
going to have to make sure that 
we get together and work on 
this ." 

Laga said the Food Coop had 
decided to support the boycott, 
and that they would provide 
stands for people to patronize 
as an alternative to the 
machines. 

[n other action Wednesday 
night. the Council: 
-approved budgets for the new 
indicator a nd Voz Fronteriza . 
The allocations , heav ily 
debated, were compromises 
between the newspaper and 
Media Boa rd budget stands. 
The new indicator dfd not 
receive th e $4 , 000 th ey 
requested for printing (they got 
$3,500 instead) , and may have 
to publish only five issues a 
quarter; 
- delayed sending a recom-
mendation to KSDT on whether 
or not that station should accept 
an advertising contract from 
the United States Navy: . 
- rejected a Council bylaw 
a mendment which would ha ve 
prohibited smoking in a ny 
Council meeting place.

Beverly Varga 
Takes 'Leave' 

According to sophomore 
Robin Dewey, who has worked 
at the cafeteria for a year and a 
half, " The main thing is that the 
equipment in the kitchen has 
been breaking down and 
nobody 's been doing anything 
(about it)." She mentioned, 
however, that since people 
have been complaining to 
Willie Johnson , Wa rren 
Cafeteria manager. he has 
"gotten nervous" a nd has been 
working on the problems. 

Johnson said the delay in 
repairing the equipment is 
because of a difficulty in 
getting parts. " The building is 
55 years old," he sa id. .. and

" They were saying tha t Willie

Ac cording to John s on , 
however, the problems have

Eclipse ' 
,Monday 

The San Diego area will fa ll 
under the shadow of the moon in 
a solar eclipse for about three 
hours Monday morning. 

According to Dr. Richard 
Canfield, Associate Research 
Physicist at UCSD, the eclipse 
"starts here at 6: 56 a nd la ts 
until 9: 09." Canfield explained 
that those a re the limes at 
which the moon just ba re ly 
" cuts a notch in the disc of the 
sun," and that the effect will not 
be rea lly apparent then. 

" Around about 8: 00 in the 
morning is when tile maximum 
coverage will be reached," sa id ' 
Canfield. 

At its peak, the eclipse will 
block about 78% of the sun 's 
light over San Diego. Canfield 
explained, however, that it may 
not seem to be as dark as most 
people usually expect from an 
eclipse that full becau e the

Carter on Tail of Bad Loans 
(Continued from page 1) 
not be checked by the 
IRS if they do not owe 
money on their income tax 
returns. 

The federal government has 
also taken measures to reduce 
the number oC deCaulted loans 
by contrdctlng with private 
collection agencies, according 
to Ruller. 

Last year 1800 UCSD students 
received federal loans totalling 
$1 .6 million. The figures include 
both undergraduate and 
graduate students. 

According to Rutter, 
Southern California has the 
highest rate of defaulted loans 
in the country . At UCSD, he 
said, 26 percent of the NDSL 
loans are delinquent (at least 
120 days overdue) . 

Glenn Torbett , Loan s 
Collection Manger at UCSD, 
remarked that the NDSL 
delinquency rate here is " fairly 
high." As a result, he said 
UCS D will turn over ali 
delinquent accounts to the 
federal government next fall 
after making certain "we've 
completed all methods of 
collection. " 

Torbett explained, "The 
federal government penalizes 
the university if there is too 
high of a delinquency rate." 
Thus, he said , the NDSL 
program is jeopardized by 
students who do not repay their 
loans. 

The national default rate of 
the GSL program, according to 
Cornfelt, has been reduced 
from 14 to ten percent in the 
past six months. He added that 

Carter's goal is to further 
decrease the ra te to six or seven 
percent. 

At UCSD, five local banks 
handle most of the GSL loans 
According to David Garcia ' 
Asst. Public Relations Office; 
for Bank of America's student 
loan service, 50 to 60 percent of 
a ll GSL loa ns are carried by 
Bank oC America. 

At the end of last month he 
said, 1300 UCSD student I~ans 
were outstanding to the bank at 
a value oC $1.7 million. Garcia 
a dded that roughly ten percent 
of these loans are in default. 

Home Federal Savings, on 
the other hand, reported less 
than a one percent default rate 
on its loans. Mellissa Keleher, 
of the bank's public relations 
department, suggested that 
their " reinforcement" policy 
may contribute to the low 
default rate. • 

"We make students' 
responsibilities very clear from 
the outset, " explained Keleher. 
" And we contact them a t least 
once every 12 months." 

United California Bank 
Wells Fargo and Crocker bank~ 
were unable to provide their 
default rates for UCSD student 
loans. 

Students who take out federal 
loans, explained Rutter, are not 
required to undergo loan 
checks a nd . need not provide 
security. 

Both federal loan programs 
allow a nine month "grace 
period " to elapse before 
st udents must begin repay. 
ments. While both require loans 
to be repaid within' ten years ,

Ph ys io log ica I Effects: 
photo li>y Stall HOlld" 

By Sieve Morus 
Senior Starr Wriler 

Raphael Levens, UCSD's Director of 
Legal Services, sees approximately 12 
students a month who have discovered 
first-hand an undoubta bly unpleasant 
consequence of using nearly all 
recreational drugs: getting busted and 
facing criminal prosecution. 

However, unlike m.my students lulled 
into a false sense of security by the 
seemingly lax drug enforcement on 
campus only to suddenly find they need 
the free legal assistance that Legal 
Services provides , Levens is fully aware 
of th' Jnpleasantries they face. 

Ahhough Levens sees between 20 to 30 
"serious" cases a year involving churges 
ranging from possession of controlled, 
dangerous substances to possession for 
sale, by far the largest number of drug-
related cases he tries involves first-time 
offenders facing low-grade drug churges 
such as possession of marijuana or used 
~drug paraphernal ia . 

Because of currently relaxed social 
attitudes towards personal drug use 
spawned earlier in thi dec<lde, the 
consequences of being urrested for <l 
drug offense may be unpleasant. but they 
are not as serious us they once were. 

Almost all oC these low-gmde cases , 
Levens said, are h,mdled by whut is 
lega lly known as u diversion, u proces 
by which criminal churges <lre diverted 
away from the triul system thereby 
avoiding a criminal conviction. Instead 
the defendent is required to attend six 
months of drug coun eling conducted by 
drug rap groups that contract with the 
county. 

The defendent successfully completing 
the counseling is never tried • .tnd is 
therefore never convicted of his offense . 
Des pite the obvious <ldv<lnt<lges of this 
arrangement, Levens pointed out two 
flaws. 

The first , Leven I uid, i that the 
counseling does nut <llways reach its 
subjects as often a1 ould be desirable. 
The success of the group administering 
the coun eling dep( nd , Levens said, on 
the degree of J'<l port achieved, 
something not easi ly done. 'I'ne ecomf 
fl aw, acco rding to L vens, while much 
more indirect , is far ore serious. 

Becau e the dive" on is s uch un eusy 
out it can indirectly I ad to more arrests, 
ones that never sh)Jld have happened, 
Levens claimed. The situation <lrises, 
Levens explained, when an officer mukes 
an arre t olely becau e he di likes 
someone's attitude and then illegally 
earehes for and eize a drug tu h. 

Since the defendent' s lawyer may take 
the diversion Inslead of forcing the 

pr~cution to pre ent <l strong case, 
pORe officer are indire tlyencouraged 

to make " unnecessary" arrests, 
believing that the defendents can get off 
easily. 

Levens believes that the 12 or so low-
grade cases that cross his desk each 
month represent the total numberoC such 
arrests affecting students here fairly 
well . In spite oC his. total monthly work 
load oC around 200 cases, the routine 
nature of diversion allows him to 
represent students in court personally . 
However, Levens said he canl10t do this 
for more serious drug offenses because oC 
the time and careCul preparation they 
require. If a defendent in such a case 
c<lnnot hire his own council, Levens will 
make sure that the public defense he 
receives is adequate by drawing upon the 
personal knowledge he gained while he 
was a public defender himself. 

Levens stres ed that an adequate 
defen e is crucial because there "is no 
doubt th<lt a student (arrested on a 
serious drug charge) will face the 
prosecution procedure." 

According to Levens, the San Diego 
City Police, not the Campus Police, h<lve 
"several inCormants and undercover 
ugents on this campu .. . Once (a student) 
sell s to an undercover agent they 've h<ld 
it. " Levens suid. "they will go to j<lil." 

will only come in if they receive a 
complaint or "if the reSident deans or 
RAs can't handle it." 

According to Sanchez, the UCSD dorms 
are considered residences and therefore 
are protected by the same search and 
seizure laws that protect a nyone's home, 
To warrant entering a dorm on a drug 

.offense, Sanchez said, the officer would

Most Drugs Are Similar 
By E ric Jaye 

Managing Editor 
Many of the recreational drugs used by UCSD 

students have a lot more in common than their 
illegality. 

The more popular illegal drugs, marijuana , 
nitrous oxide, the barbituate quaalude and the legal 
drug alcohol all have remarkably similar effects, 

according to third year pharmacology 
graduate student Richard Hawkins. 

Though there is more speculation than 
exact information on how each of these 
drugs affects the hum<ln brain and body. 
they all "take you the SClme pi <lces, .. 
Hawkins says, 

There are four distinct stages of 
alteration brought on by these drugs, . ' 
according to Hawkins. 

The first is what HClwkins calls the 
" excitement" stage, 

In this wge the drug user feels energetic 
and outgoing. 

"You can see it (;It <l cockt<lil party," S<lY 
Hawkins . "A fter a fcw drinks everyone 
begins to talk loudly and gesticulate. " 

Hawkins said that the "excitement" stage 
is " <l rush , <l releasing- of emolionul 
energies. " 

"No Pain" 

"Finally Sleep" 

After some time of "Ceeling no pain, " one 
reaches the -anesthetic stage. 

LethClrgy sets in, according to Hawkins,

Rat Rock: New Sound, Lyrics the Same 
By Barry Alfonso 

Des pite widespread pub· 
licity, British punk new wave 
bands have yet to catch on with 
U.S. record buyers. The latest 
group attempting to secure a 
beachhead here are the Irish· 
based Boomtown Rats, a sextet 
who've been topping the U.K. 
charts in recent months. 

The Rats' first Amerjcan Ip 
release, A Tonic For The 

Boughf 
Sold 

Troops, presents the band as a 
somewhat s ophistic a ted 
variation on the essentia l hard· 
driving new wave sound. The 
album's production is thick and 
thunderous, layering churning 
guitars and heavy drums, 
creating musical fudge cake 
that gets a bit too rich at times. 
Slick harmonies and echoed 
vocal effects a lso separate the 
Rats from their less refined

suggesting that GeldoC is 
purely a trendy , imitative

similarities with the songs oC

Geldof as lead singer is 
definitely the star of the 
Boomtown Rats , but his 
persona on A Tonic For The

one. His vocals are nervous and

character. Howeve r , GeldoC 
changes identities completely 
on " Rat Trap" a nd "Joey 's On 
The Street Aga in ," Bruce 
Springsteen-style urban epic

Geldof's approach becomes 
purposeful , ultraserious; gone 
is the c ampy v'ocaHzing, 
replaced by melodramatic 
intonations about maladjusted 
teenagers. This inconsistency 
undercuts the eHectiveness oC 
the album - Geldof sheds 
personalities too easily , He 
keeps me listening, but I don't 
believe him, 

It will be interesting to see iC 
the Boomtown Rats become an 
American success, The band's 
full-bodied arrangements and 
Geldofs willingness to adopt 
varying vocal mannerisms are 
probably commercial assets, 
even if they aren 't always 
artistic ones.

They take a riC, something

beat and they make a hit out of 
it." As Royse Ader put it; 
" From about '63 to about '70 
rock was like college football. 
and now it's pro footba ll. " 

In certa in ways the Rubinoos 
sha re the musical tastes a nd 

goals of many new wave/ punk 
bands . " I think punk rock is 
rea l healthy." Tom Dunbar 
comm nled. " though I don 't 
want to emulate those people 
because I thi nk most of them 
aren't very mu ica lly creative 
or ta lented. But the idea of 
simplicity is good. tha t you 
don 't ha ve to be a vi r tuoso to 

play ." Rubin empathizes with 
the flew wa vers also: " We grew 
up with ridicule too, 'cause we 
were playing pop music in a 
jazz and funk·oriented music 
scene." But he added th at the 
Rub i noos were pe rforming

before the punk rocke rs began 
getting atte n t ion - " They 
haven't had much effect on our 
direction."

that you don't have to be a virtuoso to

The Berkele y -based Ru -

Donn Spindt) bega n their se t

the end of their ha lf-hour show,

The Old Globe u,ntre for 
Performing Arts has an-
nounced plans for a new Old 
Globe Theatre to be "new-
builded in far fairer manner 
than before" on the site of the 
original. 

The San Diego landmark was 
destroyed by fire March 8 of 
last year. Still standing are the 
proscenium and parts of the 
backstage area. The 425-seat 
house, along with it$ advanced 
technic'al equipment, was 
totally destroyed.

national Exposition in 1935 was 
$17,500. The current estimated 
cost of reconstruction is a little 

\ more than 4 million dollars. 
Exterior architectural 

elements include a circular 
appearing building with 
exposed half-timber similar to 
those of the former theatre. 
Two balcony windows .. re -
sembling tbe ones in 
Shakespeare's cottage in 
Stratford, England will serve 
as historical, if eclectic , 
architectural highlights. A bas 
relief of the god Atlas 
supporting the world, a symbol 
of the theatre since the Globe 
Playhouse was constructed in 
London in 1599, will be part of 
the exterior design. 

Seating for the new Old Globe 
Theatre will be 530 . The 
farthest seat will be less than 60 
feet from the front center 
curtain. The interior design 
a lso calls for the abandonment 
of the fixed proscenium, with a 

thrust stage that places the 
audience and the performance 
in the same space. 

According to James F . 
Mulvaney, Vice President of 
the Board of Directors and 
Fund Raising Campaign 
Chairman, "our primary 
resolve, which has not changed 
since the time fo the fire, is to 
rebuild for the citizens of San 
Diego a vital part of our 
cultural heritage destroyed by 
a wanton act." 

Ground-breaking lor the New 
Old Globe Theatre is planned 
for early summer with a 
completion date of approxi-
matelyly fifte.en months after 
construction. 

The San Diego National 
Shakespeare Festival will 
continue, as last year, in the 
outdoor Festival Stage, built in 
only 52 days after the fire in a 
nearby glen.

Tritons Blow 
Out USD. 50-36 

By Joy Reardon 
After a sluggish start due to a 

long weekend break, the 
women ' s bas ketball team 
managed to hold usn 's win to 
50-36 on Tuesday night. 

" We were s leeping during the 
first ten minutes of the game, " 
said Coach Malone. "At one 
point USD was a lmost 20 points 
ahead." 

A s low offense and almost 
non-existe nt defense shaped up 
towa rd the end of the first 
half, a the csn women woke 
up to pull their lagging score 
within range of usn. 28-15. 

During the second half, the 
Triton team " worked the ball 
we ll a nd went after the 

rebounds ," according to 
Malone . Pulling some fast 
breaks and playing more 
aggressively, UCSD had 
narrowed usn's leadto6points 
when an unlucky error caused 
them to lose the ball in the last 
three minutes. USD used the 
advantage to finish off the 
contest, winning by a 14 point 
margin. 

As top scorer, Mary Egan 
chalked up all 13 of her points in 
the second half. Following her 
were Jill Keenewith 11 a nd Lori 
Goldfarb with 6. 

The women have four games 
left on their schedule, including 
the AII·Cal in Riverside on 
March 2 and 3.

The ucsn Vars ity Basket-
ball team did not lose to visiting 
Southern California College 
last Tue day night , nor did the 
Vanguards win the game. 
Rather, the officials took an 
apparent victory for the Tritons 
and handed it, to Southern 
California College in the last 
second of the contest. 

A small crowd at the Main 
Gym sat stunned in disbelief as 
they watched Vanguard Mike 
Neiswender sink two Coul shots 
with one second left. giving 
Southern California College a 
61-60 win. 

With UCSD leading 60-59, 
Neiswender fired a desperation 
shot with just one second left 
that ca rommed oHthe topof the 
backboard a nd out of bounds. 
The Tritons, it appeared, were 
victorious. However, UCSD's 
backup center Brian Keller, 
who was not involved in the 
play , was whistled for a foul on 
Neiswender as the buzzer had 
sounded. . 

After Neiswender sank the 
Winning shots UCSD's fans 
stormed the court and went 
a fter the officials, who quickly 
ran for the locker room. 

It didn' t appear that such an 
ending would take place. In the 
first half the Vanguards moved 
into a 10 point lead after 10 
minutes had e lapsed, thanks to 
a strong inside game from its 
big front line . UCSD kept 
scrapi ng and at halftime only 
trailed Southern California 
College by ten points, 34-24. 

The Tritons came out 
smoking in th s cond half and 
star ted to cu t into the 
Va nguards' lead . Lehma n 
Brockett , who brought the 
crowd to its feet with two dunks, 
led the comeback against SCC. 

Brockett got strong help from 
Stan Hopper and Scott 
Knud en. who both went to 
work on the inside game. The 
Tritons caught up with 7 
minutes left and it wa nip a nd 
tuck the rest of the way. 

With 7 seconds left UCSD 
grabbed the lead 60-59 and the 
stage was set for th e 
controversial call . 

After the contest several 
Triton players complained 
about the offiCiating. " The 
officials re<llly blew it for us," 
said one player. " It was one of 
the worst rerred game ever," 
added another. " They took it

may squeeze out the best races 
of the year. 

. Women 
This weekend's Stanford 

Invitational gives the women 
swimmers a final shot at 
qualifying for the 1979 National 
meet in Pittsburgh. 

Shawn Blaisdell needs only to 
drop a tenth of a second off her 
50 fly best of 27.0 to make the 
26.89 national standard. Janet 
Parkinson also has a chance of 
earning a trip to Pittsburgh 
with her 50 breast swim. She 
needs to drop her 33.07 time 
down to the 3l.51 All·American 
mark. Claudia O'Brien, who 
just set the UCSD 50 free 
record, can close in on the 24 .59 
qualifying time.

"If we proper'y regulate the 
process," he said, "it is a

"His policies justify my

Also, he said, "more people 
are drinking in a non-social 
fashion ," that is, privately, 
"than before." -

What Whitehill would like to 
see is for the university to be 
responsive to alcoholism. 

" We should build an 
education program within the 
university to help the tudents. 
We have to confront reality and 
not turn away (rom the 
problems.' , 

Whitehill likens the situation 
to the contraceptive program in 
the health center. Because it 
became apparent that se\ual 
activity was part of the social 
context of students. people 
responded , not by telling 
students to stop but to properly 
educate them. 

It is the si.lme with alcohol. 
Whitehill said. Insteadoftrying 
to tell students to stop drinking, 
"we must accept the fact that 
alcohol use is part of the social 
life and et up a framework ... to 
deal with any problems."

Ford said he believes that 
Proposition 13 and the states, 25 
o( which have approved 
resolutions supporting a 
constitutional amendment 
requiring a balanced federal 
budget, are an errective 
"threat'· to Congress and the 
White House , urging the two to 
"get the message" that voters 
want lower taxes. If that threat 
doesn't get a response, Ford 
said, "voters will repeat that 
message." 

Ford also addressed the 
pardon of Patricia Hearst , 
saying he wouldn't pardon 
someone unless "it was the 
Justice Department recom-
mendation" that he do so. He 
ignored a question from the 
new indicator about that 
philosophy and his pardon of 
Richard Njxon in Sept. of 1974.

frequently border on outright

from us: everybody knows who 
really won." 

The final stats reflect the 
ineptitu!1e of the officials ' 
vision of the game. Southern 
California College hit 13 or 19 
freethrows, while the Tritons 
made 2 oLL-The Tritons were 
also called for 22 fouls, while 
the Vanguards were nailed for 

just 12 fouls. 
Once again Lehman Brockett 

paced UCSD's scoring attack 
with 18 points before fOuling 
out. Brockett also snatched a 
game high 12 boards. Stan 
Hopper, in his ~cond straight 
strong performance, scored 16 
points and grabbed 8 rebounds. 
For the first pli.lce Vanguard . 
Neiswender scored a game 
high 20 points. 

Swimmers to Compete 
(Continued from page 16) 

This weekend, swimming 
against many of the top schools 
in the West, UCSD will get their 
chance to compete nationally . 
The girls flew to the Bay Area 
yesterday for the three day 
meet against powers like 
Arizona, Arizona State, UCLA, 
and of course, Stanford. 

Men 
When Fresno State's swim 

team enters the natatorium 
tonight at 8 pm they're going to 
face a Triton team determined 
to topple them in front of an 
anticipated large crowd. 

In addition to a night of 
individuals aiming for a trip to 
the National Championships in 
Alabama, in addition to a 
struggle between the equally 
quick teams, tonight is T-Shirt 
Night. 

This is the last home 
a ppearance fortheseven UCSD 
All-American swimmers and 
divers before they leave for the 
March 8-10 national cham-
pionships. 

Joe Herna ndcz, Mark Allen, 
Lance Halsted, Jim Agronick, 

elson Howard . and Greg 
McGary will all be vying for 
highcr cedes in the Alabama 
meet. Likewise, diver Brad 
Olwin seeks improvement of 
his score, although he a lready 

qualified in the one meter 
event. 

Jeff Bennett,dropping time 
fast off his 200 breast, has a shot 
at making the national 
standard. . Jim Senz 
will be trying in the 50 and 100 
free, Brian Smith in the 200 fly , 
and Mark LaMattino in the 100 
free. 

.Rubinoos 
(Conlinued from pale 13) 
echoes the feelings ofthe others 
when he voices a (ear of being 
overwhelmed by the enter-
tainment business: "I'd like to 
make some money so I could 
live comfortably, but I wouldn 't 
like to play the Oakland 
Coliseum. I'd rather do fi ve 
nights at a 3000-seat place th an 
one night in front of 15,000 
people. It's hard to play to 
people that far away and be at 
all personal. " 

A highly involved app,'oa ch 
to rock and roll is the key to the 
Rubinoos ' appeal. Their 
sentimental songs are 
believable because the band's 
affection for the music i 
genuine: "I know what can 
happen to your head in this 
business ," Dunbar remarked. 
" If I didn 't really love it. I'd 
leave . "

Needs 
Judgment 
Continued (rom page 3) 

I say this not because their 
tastes differ from mine. It is 
rather that these people scoff at 
" difference ." Disco is 
different. Old films are 
different. Classic music is 
different. 

And for John Hondros, 
although disco may not be of 
lasting cultural importance, it 
deserves a more intelligent 
critique than Hondros is 
capable of giving . I'm sure he 
would 've been more than happy 
if disco had stayed within the 
confines of the black and gay 
communities. That way he 
would have an excuse for his 

inten~ dislike of the music. 
The next time the Guardian 
proposes to comment on a 
cultural phenomenon, I s uggest 
they try to exercise a little more 
judgment.
