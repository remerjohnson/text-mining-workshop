UCSD Legall' 
Like the phoenix, student 

government in the form of the UC 
San Diego Student Coopervative 
is arising reborn from the ashes of 
the devastating referendum held 
nearly three years ago . In the 
process, a rather strange and 
possibly illegal situation also has 
arisen with regard to certain 
policies of the Board of Regents. 

First, some background . Until 
the spring of 1972, UCSD had an 
official undergraduate student 
government called the Associated 
Students of UCSD (AS) . Mem-
bership in the AS was compulsory 
for all undergraduates, and a 
mandatory membership fee of S6 
per quarter was collected by the 
registrar. 

Early in that y!,!ar, however, the 
AS became surrounded by 
controversy. -Critics charged that 
the organization was wasteful, 
inefficient, and possibly corrupt . 
Some detractors contended that 
up to 40 percent of the budget 
went for bureaucratic overhead . 
The issue of the salaries paid to 
the A S officers was hotly 
debated. 

As the result of a campaign by 
a group called the Coalition for a 

already. he found himself knee 
deep in a legal mess. The reason 
was that the resolution passed by 
an overwhelming 72 .9 percent 
majority . However , the par-
ticipation rate of 41 .2 percent, 
although higher than that at-
tained in any previous student 
election at UCSD, for any pur-
pose, was still short of the 50 
percent requirement established 
by the administration beforehand 
as the criterion of a valid 
referendum . Clearly , the 
Chancellor was in a bind . 

After deliberating for nearly ten 
weeks, on May 16 the Chal'\cellor 
finally announced his decision 
that the referendum was officiat. 
McElroy ruled that the 
referendum "has removed both 
the mandatory membership and 
fee of the Associated Students, 
and that no attempt may be made 
to resurrect either one for a 
period of one full year." George S. 
Murphy, Vice-chancellor and 
Dean of Student Affairs, com-
mented then that the Chancellor's 
decision " reduces the AS to the 
status of a voluntary association , 
if it should choose to register, 
having no different status than 

_ any other club or organization ." 

Vice-chancellor and Dean of Student Affairs George Murphy 
commented, "Por the last year and a !Jatf we have had a de 
facto student government, " but added, ''They [the Coop) do 
not purport to represent the studen( body at large . " 

Voluntary AS , the following 
referendum was submitted to all 
UCSD undergraduates early in 
March of 1972: "RESOLVED: To 
provide each student with a free 
choice, membership in the 
Associated Students 01 UCSD 
(and the membership fee of S6 
collected therefore) shall become 
voluntary . Compulsory and 
enforced membership shall end . 
The decision reached shall be 
binding for a period of one full 
academic year ." There were some 
additional questions relating to 
the setting up of a student legal 
assistance program. but they have 
no bearing on the present 
discussion . 

Insuffici~t Pilrticipiltion 
Chancellor McElroy had only 

been at UCSD five weeks. but 

Voillme 24, Nllmber 23 

There was, in short, no longer 
any official student government 
at UCSD. The AS elections 
scheduled for the following week 
were cancelled and at the end of 
the spring quarter of 1972 the 
Associated Students of UCSD 
passed ~uietly into oblivion . 

Contrary to what many persons 
may believe, there still is no 
official student government at 
UCSD. The Coop has 
neither sought nor received 
official recognition from the 
Chancellor as a student govern-
ment. The same was true last year 
of The Undergraduate Student 
Council (TUSC) . Of the nine 
campuses of the University of 
California. only UCSD and UC 
Santa Cruz have no official 
student government.

Three Governments 
The last three years have seen a 

succession of organizations 
performing, at least to somE' 
degree, the functions of a student 
government In 1972-73 It was thE' 
Chancellor's Committee on 

. Student Life and Interests, usually 
referred to by the acronym SUC 
Last year It was TUS , and thiS 
year it IS the Coop 

Chancellor McElroy was in a bind. Though the participation 
rate was higher than for any previous student election, it was 
still below the 50 percent requirement established by the 
administration to make the referendum valid. 

The trend has b en for each of 
these groups to assume more of 
the role of a student government 
than its predecessor According 
to Murphy, SUC exercised no 
judgement in the allocation of 
the Campus Activity Fee. but 
instead relied entirely on the 
results of the Chancellor 'S 
questionnaire to allocate funds 
SUC also made very few ap-
pointments; student vacancies on 
the various campus committees 
were filled mostly by the separate 
colleges. There was no formal 
participation by UCSD in any 
university-wide agencies such as 
the UC Student Body Presidents 
Council (SBPC). 

According to Dean Murphy, 
membership in the Coop is op-
tional, extending only to those 
undergraduates who attend the 
meetings . He further maintains 
that there is no fee for mem-
bership in the Coop. Exactly what, 
then, is the mandatory S6 Campus 
Activity Fee that is collected each 
quarter from all undergraduates? 
To answer that question we must 
once again go back three years. 

Fee Questionnilire 
On May 23, 1972 the Chan-

cellor sent a mail questionnaire to 
all undergraduates to determine 
what was to become of the 
organ izations and services that 
were funded in whole or in part 
by the recently defunct AS 
membership fee. Question one 
read as follows : "Do you favor the 
collection of a 'campus activity 
fee ' from all undergraduate 
students to be allocated on the 
recommendation of the Com-
mittee on the University 
Registration Fee in' support of 
some or all of the activities listed 
below?" The results looked like a 
carbon copy of the referendum of 
the previous quarter. Of those 
responding, 72 .8 percent. an-
)wered "yes" to this question . The 
parti~ipation rate was 39 .2 
percent . 

For those who supported 
collection of the Campus Activity 
Fee, the remaining nine questions 
allowed them to indicate their 
preference as to how the fee 
should be spent . In summary, the 
results were that of the nine 
existing spending categories 
listed, all were supported except 
two : stipends to the AS o'fficers, 
and $alaries for the permanent AS 
staff. 

There are two important things 
to note about the wording of the 
question shown above . One is 
that the amount of the fee is not 
pecified, although there were. in 

fact . indications at the time that 

UC Sa" Diego 

it would be substantially less than 
S6 per quarter. The other is that 
the fee was to be allocated by the 
Committee on the University 
Registration Fee. This panel is 
now known as the Advisory 
Committee for Student Fee 
Programs, or, more commonly, 
the Reg Fee committee . 

What actually developed was 
something quite different from 
what the question implied. First 
of all , the mandatory S6 fee rolled 
on, (undisturbed) by its name 
change, and without any 
reduction due to the dropping of 
the two very substantial spending 
categories just ment ioned . 
Second, the Reg Fee Committee 
has since then made it a practice 
to turn over the entire amount 
raised by the fee to whatever 
student government happened to 
exist at the time, to allocate as 

-the lattet saw fit . Although 
technically in control of the 
funds, the committee has always 
merely rubber-stamped the 
budget approved by the student 
group. 

The following year, "TUSC 
began to assume more of these 
functions," said Murphy. The 
group took an active role in the 
allocation of the funds raised by 
the Campus Activity Fee. TUSC 
also made many appointments to 
campu s committees . The 
chairperson oJ TUSC sat with the 
SBPC. 

This year the Coop has ex-
panded its activities until it now 
is functionally operating as 
though It were a student 
government . According to Mark 
Bookman, Director of the Student 
Center, " They fulfill the role that 
student governments fulfill on 
ot her campuses" Murphy 
commented, "For the last year 
and a half we have had a de facto 
student government ," but 
qualified his statement by saying. 
" They (the Coop) do not purport 
to represent the student body at

According to Director of the Student Center Mart Bookman, 
the Coop is planning to face the legitimacy question by holding 
a student referendum, "sometime within the next six mon-
ths . . , Bootman said he hopes it will come in the spring .

larae." Bookman also contends 
that the Coop has never actually 
claimed to repre.;ent the entire 
undergraduate stl dent body, but 
admits that because of the ab-
sence of any other group in a 
similiar position, "They become 
the advocacy group for students." 

De hcto Feel 
When asked whether our de 

facto student government also 
has a de facto mandatory 
membership fee, Murphy said, "I 
think that argument would be 
hard to support," and explained 
that in his opinion the lack of 
formal recognition and com-
pulsory membership make the 
charge invalid . Bookman 's 
response to the same question 
was, "The Chancellor has allowed 
the Coop to allocate the Campus 
Activity Fee." 

When asked whether there was 
any formal basis for ' this 
prerogative to be extended to the 
Coop, Murphy, who is also the 
administration co-chairman of 
the Reg Fee committee, said there 
was none. He explained that there 
was "a history of the committee 
receiving the recommendations 
of sLie or TUSC and acting on 
these recommendatiQns," and 
that the committee was con-
t inuing to follow this precedent. 

The Regents enter the picture 
in two ways. First, they must

approve ail mandatory fees 
collected by the administration . 
On September 22, 1972, the 
Regents approved the S6 per 
Quarter Campus Activity Fee," ... it 
being understood that the 
Chancellor would allocate the 
income of this Fee with the 
advice of the campus Committee 
on the University Registration 
Fee." 

Second, in a booklet entitled 
" Policies Applying to Campus 
Activities, Organizations, and 
Students," the Regents have 
stated the following policy 
regarding student governments : 
"Compulsory membership may be 
established only following an 
election in which a substantial 
number, as specified by the 
Chancellor in advance of the 
elect ion, of the affected students 
participate and in which at least 
two-thirds of those voting vote in 
favor of compulsory mem-

·bership ... no fees for membership 
in a compulsory student 
government shall be effective 
until approved by The Re-
gents .... " 

The question now is, have the 
semantics of the situation been 
juggled to perm it the re-
establishment of a compulsory

student government at UCSD, 
without the approval of either the 
students or the Regents? The 
reader is left to judge that for 
himself . 

According to Bookman, the 
Coop is planning to face the' 
legitimacy Question by holding a 
student referendum, "some time 
within the next six months." 
Bookman said that he per~lIy 
hoped the ballot would come 
during the spring quarter this 
year; Murphy was a little more 
definite in his feelings on the 
matter. The Dean indicated that 
he would have difficulty con-
tinuing the present arrangement 
very much longer without 
specific approval of the Regents 
based on a favorable mandate 
from the student body. Speaking 
of the Coop, Murphy com-
mented, "They know that this 
spring they have to fish or cut 
bait ."

"Something Unspoken" by Tennessee William s, 
presents the 15th Anniversary of a relationship ' 

Although first impressions often determine the Quality of a 
concert, last Saturday's performance of pianist Earl Wild at Sher-
wood Hall proved to be an exception . Presented under the auspices 
of the La loll a Sinfonia, E.arl Wild opened his evening of Romantic 
Music with Robert Schumann 'S "Toccatta in C Major." The work was 
marred by Wild's flawed craftmanship; it seemed as though one 
hand was continuously getting in the way of the other. However, 
Wild's technique was markedly better throughout the next piece; 
Schumann's "Fantasy in C, " Opus 17. Wild was obviously familiar 
with the Fantasy, for he preformed it in a precise and sprightly 
manner. The dynamic contrasts, SO important to the success of the 
work, were excellently done. 

-. Symphony Gives First Mandeville Concert 

Wild also tastefully conveyed the mood contrasts in Fral)z Liszt s 
"Sonata in B minor ." The austere and sombre sounds of the 
beginning created a mood that was beautifully broken by the bright 
passages that seemed to jump with resiliance. The next two pieces, 
the Liszt "Sonetto del Petrarca 104" and " Valse Oubliee No. 1 in F 
Sharp minor," while not technically difficult, were nicely per-
formed. They contained an emotional and lyrical content unlike the 
previous works, giving the concert a contrast in tone. 

For the fina/e, Wild performed Liszt 's "Three Transendental 
Etudes after Paganini ," p'ieces admirably' suited to his playing 
abi lities. These dazzling pieces, based upon Paganini's technical 
bravura, provided a display of Wild's perfection of horizontal 
movement. This was particularly true of " La Capricciosa," a stirring 
excercise in double octaves and scales. Wild's mastery of the oc-
taves seemed to cause the music to leap out of the piano into the 
aud ience, resulting in an emotional excitement that carried over to 
the end of the concert . 

50 well received was Wild's reCital, that he was twice called back 
for encores. To the obvious delight of the audience, Wild gave a 
beautiful performance of Chopin's "Pavane in G minor." This was 
typical of the recital that, for the most part, had Earl Wild living up 
to his reputation as a leader in the performance of Romantic Music .

a lot of time figuring out how to attack a difficult problem, and he doesn't have 
to remember a keystroke sequence once he's formulated his approach. He iust

of both the HP-35 and HP-45. And, at $10 each, they make nice gifts for 
people whe already own these calculators.
