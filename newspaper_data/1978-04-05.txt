Pub won't open 
until next year 
Contract difficulties/high 
insurance costs cause delay 

by Laura A. Richter 
News Editor 

An advisory report was 
issued Monday detailing the 
findings of the five members of 
the Building "c" Committee 
during their recent investiga-
tion into the contracting and 
operation of a beer pub on the 
UCSD campus. 

committee member Gary 
Moser, sets forth recommenda-
tions for the pub, which include 
the Student Center Board 
bidding out the pub to an 
independent contractor and 
that the license applied for be a 
beer and wine license, type 42, 
where minors are not allowed 
in the " designated pub area." 

Housing bias statute sought 
Law would ban discrimination against students 

Contrary to earlier reports, 
action on the beer pub proposal 
has been "on the back burner" 
acc'Ordt"ng to John Jenkel , 
Student Center Board chair-
man, because of difficulties in 
setting up Future Foods , a 
" natural " food restaurant 
which was scheduled to open 
last Monday in the Student 
Center. Because of what Jenkel 
calls " unlimited hassles" with 
the university contractors in 
constructing the appropriate 
facilities, Future Foods has 
now set the opening date for 
Monday. 

Additionally, Mo er recom-
mend that the Student Center 
Board cover the cost of any 
permanent construction, but 
that the contractor pay for all 
" trade items" , which would 
include mixers and jockey 
boxes . The report offers 
Building "c" as a suggested 
location for the pub, while 
Jenkel finds that this plan 
would complement the space 
arrangement with Future 
Foods. by Reed Alpert. UC Student It>bby, which has w~rked closely 

Associate News Editor with Berman on the bill Berman dldn't want the 
. Pr?p~ne~ts of ~ bUI prohibiting h~using two amendments to apply to the R,umford Actas 

dlscnmmatlon agamst students have declded to a whole. Since they apply basically to students, 
address the issue not by amending the Rumford Berman felt it would be better to take a whole 
Fair Housing Act but by the creation of a new approach and have the bill create a state 
separate state statute. statute rather than amend the Rumford Act. 

Tb.e RUD)ford ct prohibits bou iDg If student housing discrimiRatt~ft is-
dis~~imination o~ the basis o~ race, .c?lor, prohibited by its own statute, the enf~r~ement 
rehglOn, sex, marltal status, nallonal ongm or procedures would be different than If It were 
ancestry. Originally , the bill's author, handled by an amendment to the Rumford Act, 
Assemblyman Howard Berman (D-Beverly said Hewitt. 
Hills), wanted to amend the Rumford Act so it 
would cover students. 

Now, however, Berman wants to create a 
sepa rate state statute that would make illegal 
housing discrimination on the basis of whether 
or not a person is a student. 

The bill (AB 1032) is currently in the state 
Senate Finance Committee, and had come up 
for a vote on March 6, but Berman decided not to 
press for the vote in light of two amendments 
concerning length of lease and credit checks 

Discrimination in housing because of student 
status could be filed as a suit in small claims 
court and possibly lead to the collection of 
damages. 

If student housing discrimination were 
handled by the Rumford Act all complaints 
would go to the state Fair Employment 
Practices Commission (FEPC). Action through 
the FEPC can take three to four months, said 
Hewitt, whereas action through small claims 
court can be completed in six weeks. 

The beer pub is not scheduled 
to open until the middle of next 
year, said Jenkel, and reports 
that Future FoOOs ha<t also 
been awarded the pub contract 
are unfounded, due to a new 
university policy which 
requires the operation to have a 
minimum $5 million liquor 
liability insurance . Small 
businesses who have eyed the 
pub contract in. the past as a 
good money-making proposi-
tion are " pretty well elimi-
nated " by the burden ome 
insurance premiums , aid 
Jenkel. 

The plan states t.hat the "on-
sale Beer and Wine Only " 
license is the mo t feasible of 
all the licenses and would best 
meet the state regulations , 
probibiting minor in the pub 
area and outlawing all alco-
holic beverages from leaving 
the confines of the pub. .. 

However, Jenkel explains 
that visible contact between the 
pub and Future Foods would 
not necessarily be blocked, and 
that a simple partition would 
enable the two facilities to 
hare live entertainment. 
The report estimates the total 

construction costs necessary 
fo r the pub to be 18 ,000 , 
including utility constructions,

Industry fights against cancer safeguards 
by Art Goldberg 
Pa~ific News Service 

Can laboratory tests on mice and 
rats prove that a substance causes 
cancer in humans? 

How much of a known carcinogen 
(cancer-causing substance) can 
humans be safely exposed to in their 
work? 

How is the govern1llent to regulate 
more than 1,500 substances suspected 
of causing human .cancers, but for 
which it has no definitive proof? 

Are most cancers environmentally 
related? 

These and other issues surrounding 
the causes and detection of cancer 
will be the subject of intense debate in 
May when the Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration (OSHA) 
holds protracted hearings on its new 
proposal to regulate toxic ~ubstances 
in the workplace. 

Cancer experts and scientists from 
over the world are expected to testify 
at the hearings, which could last more 
than three montbs. 

The proposed rules would ban or 
severely restrict the use of hundreds 
of chemicals currently used in 
industry but suspected of causing 
cancer. 

" Recognition by cancer specialists 
lthat many, if not most, human can-
,cers are influenced by environmental 
ractors ... means that occupational 

cancers may be preventable if the 
causative agents can be identified 
and human exposure to them 
eliminated or minimized, " OSHA 
stated in issuing its new proposal. 

Citing a rapidly rising cancer rate 
(the American Cancer Society 
predicts one of four Americans will 
develop some form of cancer) and its 
inability to move quickly under its 
current rules, OSHA is seeking to 
streamline the entire regulatory 
process. 

Under the new rules, a study that 
finds a substance causes cancer or 
tumors of any type in animals would 
presume it also causes cancer in 
humans. 

Industry views the proposed new 
regulations with alarm . Forty 
industrial firms including Dow 
Chemical, DuPont, Union Carbide, 
Exxon, Allied Chemical, Monsanto 
and Johns-Manville have formed the 
American Industrial Health Council 
to vigorously oppose the changes. 

The council's executive director, 
Ronald Lang , believes the new 
criteria are so broad that many 
substances that are not carcinogenic 
to humans will be incorrectly labeled 
as such. 

"Lots of things cause tumors in 
animals but not in people," he said. 
"You can inject penicillin under the 
skin of a mouse and produce tumors, 

and you can get similar results with 
sulfur or fructose (a very sweet 
sugar) . 

Under the proposed new rules, he 
noted , any tumor, benign or 
malignant, produced in one species of 
test animal would be sufficient to 
place a substance on the restricted 
list. 

OSHA officials believe differently, 
however. Spokesman cited a 1977 
National Cancer Advisory Board 
report that states: " Demonstration 
that a compound is carcinogenic in 
animals should ... be considered 
evidence that it is likely to be 
carCinogenic in humans unless there 
is strong evidence in human to the 
contrary." 

Industry spoke man Lang argued 
that test animals are often given 
enormous doses of uspected 
carcinogens and that they ingest 
them in ways far different than those 
in which humans encounter them. 

OSHA pokesman, however, cited a 
scientific opinion that claims that 
high dosage animal testing is valid 
and the results can be properly 
extrapolated to humans. This point 
probably will be hotly contested in 
May. 

There is also substantial dl agree · 
ment over how carcinogens and 
suspected carcinogens are to be 
regulated . Th new rules would 

permit OSHA to pla ce everal 
hundred compounds on a restricted 
list very quickly, and consequently, 
the appeal process would be 
shortened considerably. 

If a substitute were available for a 
restricted chemical, its industrial use 
would be virtually halted . If no 
substitute could be found , then 
employee exposure would be et " as 
low as feasible ." 

The industry council recently filed 
an 85-page brief in which it challenged 
ome of the basic as umptions behind 

the new rule . The indu try group, for 
example, maintained that indu trial 
chemical only repre nt a mall 
fraction of the environmental cau e 
of cancer. 

It argued that " pand mil:! cigarette 
moking" is a far more influential 

environmental factor on tlte cancer 
rate and sugge ted that if lung 
cancers are removed from the 
national figures , the cancer rate 
would actually be hown 0 be in 
decline . 

The council further contended that 
it would be far less costly for Congres 
to upply OSHA with additional 
manpower to continue I ca e-by-
case review than to impo weeping 
tandard on industry. 



Forgetting the '60s 
by Ted Burke 

Con&ribatinl Editor 
Don't it always seem to go 
That you don't know what you got 
Til it's gone, 
They've paved paradise 
And put up a parking lot .. 

- Joni Mitchell 

They've paved paradise and put up a parking lot, as well as.a 
shopping center, a string of condominiums, a hospital and an 
addition to the gym. Many who are mourning the loss of something 
once held dear are still sobbing into their hankies ten years after 
the fact. 

To clarify the metaphor, the talk among those who remember 
the "good old days" has become so incessant that I'm wishing, at 
the moment, that the Sixties never happened. America is filled 
with would be intellectuals, burned out gadflies, addle brained 
drug fiends, makeshift Marxists, and all manner of Johnny Come 
Latelies who in some sort of distended post mortem funk wallow in 
the land of the Great Used To Be. The term "survivor" has become 
a media buzz word to describe anyone who had found in the Sixties, 
either through mass media (which informed them who they were 
and what they should be doi~g) or in activities with those who 

. shared the same "consciousness", a belief system that fueled 
their lives with radical optimism, commitment, vision and

their meal tickets and catch phrase ideology made into something ClcleglE PI~ __ .a-

Letters to the editor Being a Sixties leftover has become, strangely, something very 
marketable, evinced by Sara Davidsons' horribly self-sentimental 
book Loose Change, Tom Hayden's delve into electoral polities 
while abandoning his earlier radicalism, Bob Dylan's supremely 
idiotic ego exercise in his film Renaldo and Clara, or in Rolling 
Stones' frequent morose obsession wifh its own importance. The 
theme of all these bits of evidence is that the people cannot believe 
that they've gotten older, and in mulling over the days of youth, 
cannot grasp the fact that things they once believed in seem faintly 
silly. The "survivor" tag informs us that these characters had 
committed some kind of psychic bravery to get through the past 
decade alive, as though to be alive at the time were a spiritual 
commando mission into enemy territory. What we have, in effect, 
is a gross cheapening of the term. "Survivor", to me, means 
someone who's survived a mugging, a war, a rape, or a napalm 
bombing of their village. But in keeping with the American 
proclivity for idealizing with its recent past, we've imbued the 
Sixties with a romanticism that one develops only with distance. 
The farther we get away from something, the better we think we 
understand it, and the better it look~.

David Bowie kicked off his 1978 
tour right here in San Diego,with a 
stellar performance. proving to 'both 
fans and critics alike that he is &he 
consummate seventies-style artist. 
And I do mean artist. Though 
Aerosmith or Ted Nugent might 
conceivably draw larger crowds. I 
would hesitate in calling either Steve 
Tyler or Nugent artists. 

Bowie stated beforehand that his 
concerts would definitely contain a 
substantial amount of material from 
his Low and Heroes albums. so his 
diehard fans from the Ziggy days 
were forewarned . But no warning 
was necessary. really. for his set was 
so well-paced 8S to make the music 
from both of his latest LPs sound 
almost inviting. 

mission. and the one that probably 
ignited the audience. was the rocker 
"Jean Genie." It was. in a word. 
spectacular. Yet it was only a hint of 
what was to come. 

Following the intermission. Bowie 
walked back on stage and said to tbe 
audience, "It would be my great 
pleasure to perform some ZIII' 
S&ardust", then delved into "Five 
Years". the first of seven straight 
songs from his classic 1972 album. 
For a man who vowed he was through 
with rock n' roll he sure rocked 'em 
good. The audience response wu 
ecstatic; Bowie was derinitely back. 
He finished his show with ,ome 
numbers off of the S&a&ion to S&a&ioll 
album. including the encore "Stay." 

There were several things about 
the San Diego concert that really 
impressed me. The first thing, of 
course, had to be his opening. Bowie 

.. ~;;;~~=~~~~~~~;;;;~==:;~~~.I scorned the overdramatic entrance of fanfare and flashing lights usually 
seen in rock concerts (including his 
Own past tours) and simply strolled 
on stage with his band while the 
houselights were still on. And while 
the low-key entrance itself may not 
have meant anything, its overall 
implications were important to the 
show, for Bowie appeared more 
accessible and approachable than he 
has in years. 

Anyway you look at it. Bowie', waa 
a quality show. His set was 
considerably longer than the one 011 
the previous tour. Tbe white liPtina 
effects were excellent. as was the 
sound quality. His band, many of 
them holdovers from the past. played 
well, while guitarist Adrian Belew 
played out of his head . Really 
excellent. cfRe S'oeurf cIllfair

Opening with an instrumental cut 
off the Low LP, Bowie and his 
excellent band moved through the 
first half of the show (there was an 
intermission) surprisingly well ,

the tour. Most of the first half of the 
show was dominated by his new

The album. produced by Jay David l 

Saks. is being released ' late this 
month on RCA 's Red Seallable. and 
the first 50,000 copies are being 
released a~ " collector's items" on a 
special green vinyl. 

Announcement was made by 
Thomas Z. Shepard. Division Vice-
president . Red Seal Artists and 
Repertoire. who said: "David Bowie 
gives a remarkable reading as 
narrator of 'Peter and the Wolf.' In 
creating his mood, David imagined 
he was telling the tale to his son, 
Zowie. and the result is a recording 
which will delight the millions of 
Bowie fans and bring a wide new 
audience to the Prokofieff lovers as 
well." 

The album will be given a major 
"pop-type" merchandilling and 
advertising campaign, details of 
which were revealed today by Irwin 
Katz, Director of Red Seal Merchan-
disinc. 

The campaign calls for print 
advertising in such publications as 
Rolling Stone, Stereo Review and 
college publications in such major 
markets 1:Is Berkeley. Calif.. Tempe. 
Ariz .. Dallas. Texas, Ann Arbor and 
East Lansing. Mich.. Pittsburgh.

A progressive radio campaign will 
include such markets as Philadel-

Francisco, Boston. Chicago and 
Seattle. 

All phases of the campaign will be 
linked together by the copy line,

The concept of bringing the 
Philharmonic "to the people" so 
to speak was kind of interesting, I 
thought. Kind of like how World

classical music buffs. but they

" Music From Outer Space" 
comes to San Diego at the Sports 
Arena on April 17 witli Peter Eros 
and the San Diego Symphony. 

- Tim Mackenzie 

Who can resist Mozart? Any Mozart. Especially an operatic 
comedy at its best. with music and libretto fusing in joyful 
harmony. 

Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte" . streamlined for conlemporary 
a udiences will be presented by the UCSD Young Arti 1 
Experimen'tal Theater tonight. and agai.n on Friday April. 7. 
Saturday April 8, at 8 o'c1ock; Sunday. Aprtl9 at3 pm. Mandeville 
Recital Hall . 

In some respects . "Cosi Fa n TuLli" is the most remarka~le of 
Mozart's operas. Using as his point of depa~ure an ~rdtnary 
comedy of love. i.e .: with the help of the maid . Despma . Don 
Alfonso. an old cynic proves to his two young friends. Gug.liemo 
and Ferrando. that their fiancees Fiordiligi and Dorabella, hkeall 
women are unfaithful - Mozart produces a remarkable score. 
subtle i'n characterization and of profound psychological insight. 
The music continuously catches and hightens the nuances of the 
play and with amazing dexterity maintains a subtle balance 
between comedy and burlesque. sentimentality and mockery. 
tenderness and broad satire. 

In its current production. The Experimental Opera Theater will 
try a totally new approach. according to John Large. director. The 
cast will appear in modern dress in an original piano bar setting 
designed by stage director Da n Dryden. 

Five singers - Vincent Russo. as Don Alfonso. the cynic. Stuart 
Larson. Gugliemo. Glenn D' Abreo as Ferrando. Kat~ryn Evans as 
Fiordiligi . Nancy Jones. Dorabella - the lovers. Lmda Gossfeld 
Despina. the maid. who also .doubles as the barmaid - reminisce 
in a piano bar featuring pianist Peter Kairoff. All of them have 
performed in " Cosi Fan Tutte" somewhere before. I.n the proc~ss 
of their reminiscing. the opera is reenacted. To the mtermes bmg 
of score and plot. will be added the third dimension of offstage 
reality - a Dlay within a play. 

John. Large. singer. actor. director. lecturer. is known for his 
lieder recitals in this area, a nd his direction of previous successful 
Young Opera Theater productions. Da n Dryden has received 
acclaim for designing ingenious sets in past UCSD Theater 
productions. ~ 

Of the cast - all veteran performers - Russo has performed 
frequently with the San Diego Opera. Larson. D' Abreo, Evans. 
Jones and GOS{ifeld. have participated in Young Artist Theater 
productions. L,ric Theater, Early Music Ensemble. Musica 
Reperta. among others . First place winner of the . La Jolla 
Civic/UniveJ:Sity. Youth Talent Auditions. Peter KaJroff. has 
presented numerous recitals and concerts. . 

Members Of the audience will be enticed to participate in the 
production by attractive piano bar waitresses offering liquid 
refreshments. 

General admission $3; students $1. Tickets available at UCSD 
Box Office.
