Maharishi haa personally 
trained 12,000 TranIIcendentai 
Meditation instructon, who have, 
in tum, initiated a total of 900,000 
Americana who, for ~ most part, 
faithfully practice the simple 
relaxation technique twice dialy 
for 20 mintues. 

The attraction? Meditators 
claim that thinking the mantra - a 
meaningless soWld - while com-
fortably seated with the eyes 
closed produces a sensation of 
imler tranquility and develops the 
human potential for productivity. 
Studies have shown significant 
reduction in the metabolic rate 
among meditators, as well as a 
quieting of the brain waves during 
the meditation period. 

The significance of TM, in 
contrast with individual attempts 
to develop varying meditation 
techniques, is explained by Lee 
Ryan, who is currently teaching an 
extension course through UCSD 
entitled " Towards an Ideal 
Society," Said Ryan, "The 
process, when done right, is so 
imlocent and effortless. The othen 

involved control of the mind 
through concentration."

interested in practicing the 
technique. The remaining of the

President Leifer. 
It has a nice ring to it. It sounds 

charismatic, authoritative and 
suave. Jeff Leifer likes to think he 
fills these bills. 

Although Leifer calls Sindler " a 
damn hard worker," he is " doing 
some real bad things," according 
to the president. 

Leifer criticized Sindler 
specifically for secretly calling 
together a select group of AS 

well as the apathetic student, both 
of whom I promise to strive to 
serve. 

" Mark is an inexperienced chair, 
which accounts for some of the 
slow down in recent meetings," 
explained Leifer, who feels , 
bowever, that SiAdler is learning 
fast and will prove effective on the 
new Student Center Board and in

Supreme Court read ies itself 
for next week's Bakke case 

The us Supreme Court's decision in the Bakke reverse discrimination 
case is already being called the most influential decision concerning 
racial integration since the historic school integration cases of 1954. 

A record 54 briefs have been filed in the case, including one from the 
Carter administration. 

Specifically, the case will affect the special admissions programs at the 
University of California professional schools ; it will also , however, have 
broad implications for any program that considers race as a criterion for 
participants. 

The high court will hear the case on Oct. 12 and is expected to hand 
down a decision in the spring. 

Dependent upon another Supreme Court decision , you may be able to 
buy copies of the infamous Watergate-White House tapes. Former 
President Nixon went to court to try t stop Warner Communications Co. 
from marketing the tapes played during the trial, but lost in 8 federal 
appellate court. 

The Supreme Court will hear the case during its upcoming term. 

The ASUCSD president. com-
bined a command of rhetoric and 
political manuveuring to expose, 
yet further obscure, the working 
and long term goals of the infant 
student government in a recent 
Triton Times interview. 

Addressing the confict of 
authority which has arisen bet-
ween AS vice-president Mark 
Slndler and himself, Leifer stated 
that "because of the shortage of 
man-power and growing pains of a 
new government, .Mark finds 
himself, as I do, in a position of 
making many key decisions which 
are not preceeded by proper in-
vestigation and conununication."

meeting series called "Wednesday 
Night Discussion Group Two." 
Gathered at Mesa apartments, the 
meetings· were an attempt on 
Sindler's part. to establish a core 
group of power within the AS, 
according to student sources. 

Saying that Sindler first con-
ceived of the idea following last 
spring's student government 
elections, Leifer stated that " After 
many conferences, I feel everyone 
understands that small com-
mittees are ,important for policy

Miller calls students together; 
College AdvisQry Board in SO 

by Vanessa Griego 
Staff Writer 

Ed Miller, District Attorney for 
the County of San Diego, is 
currently in the process of 
establishing what he terms a 

"College Advisory Board." 
" It is the intent of this board to 

provide an opportunity for students 
from all colleges in the county to 
meet and exchange ideas on 
pertinent issues and problems 
concerning the college com-
munity ," explained Vicki Hirsch, 
Youth Advisory Coordinator. 

The role of the Board, however, 
does not stop at the discussion 
stage, said Hirsch. " Its overall 
purpose is to bring about changes 
in present law enforcement agency 
policies and procedures. It is hoped 
that through open group discussion 
students will be able to suggest 
topics they feel should be in-
vestigated . Then they could 
organize and carry out an in-
vestigation," furthered Hirsch. 

Projects undertaken by the new 
Board will not require prior ap-
proval of the District Attorney, 
although funds for the projects are 
to be provided by his office . Hirsch 
stres ed, "Any project the Board 
undertakes is completely upon its 
own initiative and choice. At the 
ame tim , Mr. Miller offers his 

complete support and makes 
available whatever resources are 
necessary." 

The College Advisory Board will 
not be the first of its kind in San 
Diego. A similar board made up of 
county high school students has 
been in operation since 1971. A 
college leve board was also fonned 
in 1975 at San Diego State 
University. It was the success of 
both of these boards that prompted 
Miller to expand the initial SDSU 
Board into an all~ollege board. 

Past projects of the SDSU Board 
have included a survey of police 
and public attitudes towards law 
enforcement and a proposal for an 
alternative method for handling 
juvenile delinquents. The high 
school board's survey on alcohol 
use among high shcool students 
received nationwide media 
coverage, as ell as interest from 
school officials and various 
community agencies. 

Previous boards have also taken 
an interest in educating them-
selves about the criminal justice 
system. With the help ct the 
District Attorney, they have 'made 
behind the scenes trips to 
correctional institutions, such as 
Olino State Prison, as well as 
participating in the San Diego 
Police Department's "Ride-A-
Long" program. 

Hirsch feels that "participation 
on the Board is an excellent op-
portunity for all tudents to get 
involved within the criminal 
justice system. It provides a 
practical exp rience in identifying, 
analyzing and proposing ap-
propriate actions with respect to 
community related problems. 
Although the Board's focus is 
primarLy on law enforcement-
related lopics and issues, students 
from 'ill orientations and 
backgrounds are invited to attend 
meetings and offer their input."

Our era m1gtt well be called the 
Age of Energy Consumption. 

Our world continues to grow in 
complexity and numbers, hence in 
demand for power. If present 
consumption trends continue, we 
must soon eKplolt nuclear fuels on 
a grand scale. 

Two means of obtaining energy 
from nuclear reactions are fission 
and fusion. This article !dves a 
layman's discuasion of tbe 
processes, promiaes, and proolems 
of nuclear energy. 

lI1uioa 
Firat- conaider fissIon, the 

splitting of heavy, UDIItable nuclei 
into smaller nuclei. Atomic bombs 
and nuclear reactors operate on 
the fluion principle. 'lbe first 
atomic bambi utiIlzed an i.Iotope 
of W'IIIium. U ~ as fuel. 'lbe U 235 
nuele.. is able to absorb a slow 
ne.ron readily. 

When a U 235 nucleus captures 
such a neutron, it becomes 
distIWbed so much that the elec-
trostatic repulsion between 
protons becGmes greater than the 
bondinc abOlty of the short ranee 
nuclear forces. 'lbe nucleus thus 
rues apart into two rougbly equal 
nuclei and two free neutrons wblch 
can in turn activate adjacent 
nuclei, cuaslng a chain reaction. 

The maas of the products after 
fission is less than the mass of the 
reactants. Tbls difference, a~ 
breviated drn, appears as the 
energy given by Einstein's famous 

eq .. tion, E=(dm)c ~ where c 
stands for the ipeed of light. 

process does not occur except at 
temperatures on the order of 100 
million degrees centi«rade 
because much energy is required 
to overcome the repuision between 
protons in the two nuclei and to 
allow the strong nuclear forces to 
join the two into a single, stable 
nucleus. At such high tem-
peratures matter exists as a gas of 
electrons and nuclei called a ' 
plasma. 

Hydfogen and Its isotopes thus 
serve as the most practical fuel, 
having only one proton per 
nucleus. 

For laboratory conditions the 
most appealing fusion reactions 
are between two deuterium nuclei 
(D-D or H ~H ~ and between 
deuterium and tritium (I).T or H 2 
H 3). The D· T reaction, tor 
example, produces an alpha 
particle (He 4 nucleus), a neutron 
and 17.6 MeV (=1.6x10 .13joules) of 
energy, most of which is kinetic 
energy of the neutron. Fusion 

processes occur continuously at a 
relatively slow rate in the stars. At 
the other extreme, fusion reactions 
occur extremely rapidly in an 
explosion of a hydrogen bomb. The 
requisite conditions for fusion to 
occur in a bomb blast are brought 
about by triggering the explosion 
with an ordinary atomic bomb. 

The great difficulty, as yet un· 
solved, is to make efficient fusion 
occur at a controlled, intermediate 
rate under conditions which we can 
maintain in laboratories. At

If enough high grade U 235C8J1 be 
assembled, the reaction is self-
suatalnlng. nus sufficient quantity 
Is termed the critical mass. In a 
bomb the critical mass is 
assembled rapidly. The chain 
reaction occurs 10 quickly that the 
energy Is relea,sed explosively .In a 
reactor the rate of the chain 
reaction is controlled by in-
troducing rods that . can absorb 
neltrons into the fuel assembly. 
Absorption of a neutron removes it 
from the cbain, as It cannot ac-
tivate another nucleus; the 
reaction is thus slowed. 

Fuloa 
Fusion, as the name implies, 'is 

the joining together of light nuclei 
to f!)rm a heavier nucleus. The 

As in the complementary fission 
process, the mass of the product 
nucleus is less than that of the 
reacting nuclei, so energy is 
evolved. Oearly, the more protons 
in the reacting muelei, the more 
difficult It is to bring about fusion. 
The difficulty is In fact propor-
tional to the produet of the number 
of protons in each nucleus.

Abortion acceptance likened to 
Hitler's "utilitarian murders" 

Three of our fellow students have 
- a , well reasoned moral stand on 
abortion. Yciu have probably heard 
by now that the University has 
refused to enroll them unless they 
compromise these moral beliefs. 

These people object to a ma~ 
datory fee which Is used to pay for 
what they regard as killing. They 
are told that they must accept 
cooperation in this kllllng as part of 
the price'bf a uam education. 

The societal issue Is human life 
itseU. And we all have a good deal 
to say about that. After all, we 
were not aborted. 
. Think about that. YOU WERE 
NOT ABORTED. Neither were any 
of your parents. None of III, I 
suspect, would be willing to trade 
our life to provide our mothers with 
a ~roactive fertility control 
option. In fact , we would fight 
rather savagely. to prevent the 
-,....,-===-....,....~~=-----.-- -

Now, wait just a ininute! Isn't 
the University supposed to defend 
freedom of conscience? By what 
right does it asrume the role of 
social engineer and declare that 
your conscience Is null and void, 
and that abortion service Is a 
mandatory adjunct to the pursuit 
of acadenUC excellence? 

Even more, wasn't religious 
freedom guaranteed to all in our 
country nearly 200 years ago? How 
then can an agency' of the State of 
California force these three 
students ·to sacrifice their 
education, and possibly jeopardize 
their future careers, simply 
because they conscientiously 
object to the willful taking of 
human life? 

We must conclude from the 
University's action that our ad-
min istrators see some fun-
damental social imperative for 
"taxing" us for providing abortion 
service , an imperative more 
fundamental even than the con-
stitutional right to freedom of 
conscience. 1be recent Supreme 
Court decision on the Hyde 
Anunendment indicates that there 
is no such fundamental im-
perative, but the University 
doesn 't seem t.o~gree. Let us then 
examine aborti n in its societal 
context, to set w it might justify 
setting aside our Frlst Anunen-
dment rights. 

It is necessary to establish 
clearly what the ISSue is. IL is not 
by any stretch Gf the imagination 
just some a*stract surgical 
procedure ·1 iously labeled 
" interruption)f regnancy." 

Neither is 1'. a " woman's right" 
'to kill a baby which would in-

convenience her. 
Nor is it simply a question of 

whether nolM!lected university 
officials can use student monies to 
pay for the slaughter of more than 
275 defenseless human beings 
annually . 

WC'\ISo Q("e you, 
when (ou 3et 

~olcln to it.. . 

exercise of that option. 
You might say, wevaiue life. Our 

life. But does our life have any 
value if others are in-
discriminantly terminated? Have 
we forgotten how much the value of 
our life depends on the value 
society places on life in any of its 
phases ? 

This has happened before, and 
only a few decades ago. Many still 
remember how, in one of the most 
scientifically advanced countries 
in Europe, the social acceptance of 
abortion began a pattern of logic 
and corruption of medical ethics 
which led to the most casual 
atrocities. 

The sequence of events was 
rather painless. Abortion, then as 
now, made a social virtue of killing 
human beings who were " un-
wanted" or potentially defonned 
or socially "unproductive." No one 
cried stop - and so this became the 
accepted attitude -in Germany 
during the '192O's and 1930's. Before 
Hitler. 

Doctors, well respected 
University doctors, calloused and 
encouraged by the abortion ethic, 
began to routinely kill in the name 
of euthanasia. No'one cried stop. It 
was a lOgical step and, well, it 
wasn 't them. 
. First idiot and deformed 

children were " terminated," then 
the " unwanted " aged, then the 
mental patients, then the 
phr'ir.aUy -han.d,i.capped. It didn't 
even matter that they were "pure" 
Aryans, . they were not socially 
useful or wanted. So no one cried 
stop. 

The gu chambers and the 
"ethics" which the University 
doctors oeveloped in this process 
were then adopted by Hitler to 
eliminate "defective" races. Those 
who cried stop were also 
eliminated. 

This Is not speculation. It Is 
verified by competent historical 

studies, which were not motivated 
by the current abortion debate. 
The unborn went silently, if un-
willingly. The society accepted it, 
its sensitivity was dulled, and CIte 
value of Uf~ was lessened. If the 
unborn were expendable, why 
defend the weak who were already 
born? They were killed, and the 
value of life cheapened again. Step 
by logical step, German society 
acclimated itself to utilitarian 
murder, Wltil it could accept the 
wholesale slaughter of millions. 
Until it took the slaughter of many 
more millions to stop the process. 

It can happen here. No, It II 
bappeldng bere. A million abor-
tions a year, to start. Abortions, 
remarkably enough, liberally 
promoted for "the poor" - that is, 
for Black and Chicano women. 
With sterilization a high risk 
consequence of any abortion, 
racial sterilization is well un-
derway, as it is for the American 
Indians. Euthanasia societies are 
growing in strength, and the 
murder of (already born ) defor-
med or "defective" babies is being 
openly promoted and surrep-
titously practiced. 

Just one or two more easy steps. 
What will be the value of your life

Abortion is not a matter of 
" chQice." It is a matter of life, 
Human Life. Its open and accepted 
practice cheapens the value of life. 
Your life. If you do not defend those 
who cannot speak for themselves, 
there will be none to speak for you 
when you are no longer "useful", 
or " socially productive", or 
convenient, or "wanted." . 

Human life, from conception to 
natural death, Is one thing in the. 
world which Is unique ' and 
priceless. If we, as a society, ac-
cept the uninformed arguments of 
those who promote abortion for the 
sake of their own pleasure and 
convenience, we sell out our own 
lives.

Film badly 
presented ' 

Last Monday's AS Free Film 
series showing of Little Big Mao 
was rather disappointing. We 
arrived one half hour early (my 
friends and I were the first group 
there) since we knew such a 
popular show would draw a large 
crow~. At approximately 8:55 we 
were allowed to enter building C of 
the Student Center where the film 
was to be shown. 

The room was overcrowded and 
getting hot . The screen and 
projector were small portables, 
obviolllly inadequate for any 
realistic predictions of attendance. 
My friends and I decided to leave, 
not wishing to see a good movie 
ruined by such an amateurish 
showing. If the AS can go to the 
expense of renting a film, ' they 
should at' least go to the trouble of 
showIng it with reasonable 
facilities . UCSD Is loaded with 
lecture halls which could serve this 
purpose.

ASUCSD sends college reps 
to· clear seB .controversy 

In WedneIday's (September 28) 
luue fI. the Trftea TIme. two 
leUera were printed dealing with 
the reorganization of the Student 
Center Board. ID tbeIe letters 
lICJIDe facta were misrepresented 
wbile ather situations referred to 
were aCcidental and are being 
rectified. 

First, the ASUCSD represents 
ALL Undergraduates at UCSD. 
The AS CcumcD is elected by the 
entire student body, unlike college 
govenunenta. Also the ASUCSD 
has college representatives sitting 
on the Council Thus, to say that 
the charter Is non-representative is 
ridiculous. The issue Is not one of 
representation but one of what 
'l:YPE of representation will best 
serve tbe students. 

Second, space allocation Is NOT 
at the discretion of the Facilities 
Board Cllair, It remains up to the 
entire Student Center Board to 
allocate space. 

Third, admittedly the Student 
Center Board Cllarter was not 
adequately discussed before being 
approved by the AS Council. 
Although it was intended that 
College Councils and last year's 
Board be consulted, in the process 
of budgets, etc., this was not dOl'le. 
Steps have been taken to rectify 

the situation. The College 
Representatives bave been asked 
to contact their COllege Govern-
ments to get their College's 
position on the Cllarter. The 
Representatives wiH then meet 
with Jeff Leifer, ASUCSD 
President, and other students 
interested in the matter to decide 
what, if any, changes need to be 
made to the Charter. 

Finally, the ASUCSD has not 
removed Student Organizations 
from the Student Organizations 
Complu. The AS Council has 
directed its officers using offices 
not allocated to the ASUCSD by the 
Student Center Board last spring. 
to vacate those omce. This has 
been done in order to avoid any 
appearance of removing Student 
Organizations from their offices. 

The ASUCSD welcomes input 
from students on our policies and 
actions. However, we would ap-
preciate students checking with us 
to be sure their criticl.!jJns are 
accurate before publlshirig them. 
AS meetings are open, and AS 
officers can be contacted through 
the Student Organizations Office. 
Be involved in your government -
but be responsible. 

JONBEKKEN 

Coverage termed inaccurate 
but it's seen as a start 

Apparently your staff writer was 
not attending the same ASUCSD 
meeting that I attended last 
Thursday night. At that meeting 
several important resolutions were 
acted upon . Although the AS 
Council did fail to act upon the two 
Communications Board Charters 
before important issues such as the 
Student Center Board, an attempt 
to override the Presidential veto of 
the Communications Incentive 
Fund, and an attempt to commit 
the ASUCSD to working to rescind 
the $5 per quarter fee required to 
get comprehensive health in-
surance. 

The attempted override of the 
Communications Incentive Fund ' 
Veto was brought about by me 
because the funds allocated to ALL ' 
Campus Media were inadequate. I 
di~ not single out the New 
Indicator's puny budget for extra 
attention. 

The Resolution dealing with the 
student Center Board directed the 
ASUCSD to return the Student 
Organization Mailboxes to the 
Student Organizations Complex 

and to send a letter to J'om Brown, 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs, protesting his 
failure to register Student 
Organizations as well as taking the 
actions outlined in your article. 

Further, the provisJon dealing 
with college representatives was 
not suggested by Jeff Leifer and 
did not "ask the colleges to idenWy 
the representatives who have the 
responsibility for resolving college 
objections over tbe student center 
charter." Instead that provision 
directed college representatives to 
speak with their college govern-
ments, ascertain the college's 
position on the charter, and then 
meet with Jeff Leifer and other 
interested students to resolve the 
objections to the charter. 

However, despite the inaccuracy 
o~ your coverage it Is a definite 
improvement over your coverage 
of past ASUCSD activities. I hope 
to continue seeing comparable 
Improvement wittt eaeh iasue. Only 
with responsible coverage by 
campus media can the AS become 
truly responsive to student needs.

Liberty triumphs I~'-
Do-nothing policy saves Portuga~ 

PNS - American diplomats in 
Usbon have learned an Ironic 
lesson In the workings of in-
ternational diplomacy - that 
democracy sometimes thrives 
when America Is, or at least acts as 
though It is, indifferent to the fate 
of freedom elsewhere. 

Here in Portugal, liberty has 
both survived and succeeded 
without America supporting any 
friend, opposing any foe, indeed 
with the White House, state 
Department, CIA, Pentagon and 
National Security Council not 
doing much of anything at all. 

In April 19'14, tbe Portuguese 
Unexpectedly overthrew Western 
Europe's oldest dictatorship. In the 
ensuing confusion, Portugal's vast 
colonial empire disintegrated. 
Portugal had not beld a free 
election in nearly 50 years. The 
Communists were strong here, the 
democrats inexperienced , 
ignorance and poverty 
widespread. 

In Washington it was feared 
}>t\rtugal would become "the Cuba 
of NATO," that the U.S. would lose 
its Azores bases, that a commlDlist 
Portugal would soon infect half of 
Africa and most of southern 
Europe with anti-Americanbm. 

None of the dire pred1citons 
came true. More than three years 
later, Mario Soares, a strong anti-
communist and friend of the 
United States, Is prime minister of 
Portugal. His Socialist Party has 
routed the Communists in four 
national elections. The Soviet 
Union has no lnfiuence and no 
bases here. The U.S. has kept Its 
AzoreS bases. Americans are 
personally popular In Portugal. 

In spite ~ a civil war in Angola, 
the Portuguese empire was 
liquldatedwith far less bloodshed 
than the French and British em-
pires-and with far fewer strategic 

problems for the United States. If 
there is a real political rather than 
economic threat in Portugal today, 
it is that the right, not the left, may 
win too much power and that 
peaceful reform of Portuguese 
society will not occur fast enough. 

How did America achieve all 
this? By not doing a thing. 
_ No special meetings of the Forty 
Committee were convoked to deal 
with Portugal. No CIA black bags 
full of portuguese cash - or guns -
were passed to the anti-communist 
forces here. The U.s. ambassador 
in Ilsbon delivered no ultimatums, 
and the Pentagon did not do a thing 
either. 

"It was a stroke of brilliant 
diplomacy," Portuguese historians 
and political commentator yasco 
Correira Guedes said recently. 
.. America paid us the compliment 

of letting us solve our own 
problems in our own way . The 
same policy would have served you 
far better in Africa, Latin America 
and Indochina." 

But in fact it was an inadvertant 
and accidental policy that saved 
U.S. interests here , opposed by the 
highest officials in the State 
Department, CIA and White 
House. 

M eager to intervene in Portugal 
as he was in Angola , former 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 
fired one U.S. Ambassador to 
Portugal, Stuart F. Scott, when he 
predicted meddling in Portuguese 
affairs would "create the greatest 
self-fulfilling prophesy in history" 
and deliver Portugal into com-
munist hands. 

All-night study maratholl 
bri~gs profound experiences 

Last year at UCSD I stayed up all 
night writing papers or studying 
many times. n's amazing how 
relaxed and unhurried an all-
nighter can be once you've com-
mitted yourself to it. When you 
need a study break, you can just 
take a walk around campus in 
absolute quiet, without meeting 
anyone. Your sense of awareness 
changes, and little things passed 
over quickly during the day (an 
occasional birdsong, the approach, 
passing, and departure of a car on 
Torrey Pines Road. the ar-
chitecture of the buildings) are all 
more acutely perceived. The still 
night air induces the caffelned, 

serni~mausted mind to relax in 
contemplation and meditation. 

Then at the end of the all-night 
comes the sunrise. One of my most 
memorable moments in my life 
came on the morning after an 
Ames midterm ali-nighter, when I 
went up on top of Tioga to see the 
sunrise. A thunderstorm had 
broken up about five in the mor: 
ning, but the clouds and colors of 
that sunrise in its wake were 
among the most beautiful sights I 
will ever see in my life. I wanted to 
wake up my best friends and show 
it to them, but I realized that they 
would not be in the right frame of 
mind to appreciate it. I got ~ "A" 
on my Ames test, but the sunrise 
was what made the nigJi wor-
thwhile. I hope to do it again this 
year.

by Coaaie Bruet 
(PNS)-A 15-year-old girl in 
Washington uka a juvenile court 
to declare her "incorrigible" and 
place her In a foster home of her 
choice. Sie and her parents have 
been feuding-over whom she 
dates, whether or not she may 
srnoke-and she considers these 
differences Irreconcilable. 

The judge, apparently concerned 
that she might otherwiae run away 
frlm home, grants her request. His 
decision, appealed by the parents, 
is upht:ld by the State Supreme 
Court. 

In Massachusetts, a number of 
pregnant teenagers join as un-
named plaintiffs In a suit attacking 
the constitutionality of a state 
statute, which requires a minor 
desiring an abortion to gain the 
consent of both parents or a court 
order. The case will be heard by 
the U.S. Supreme Court In the fall . 

And In Califomia-in a case that 
will soon come before the State 
Supreme Court-a l4-year-old 
youth challenges the law that 

I allows a parent to commit a child 
to a mentsl hospital without any 
hearing. 

The inevitable contest has 
begun. Across the country, youth 
advocates are declaring that 
children, too , have their 
inaHenable rights, which cannot be 
infringed upoo-whether by state, 
school system, 01' even their own 
parents. This last claim, however, 

I raises the most difficuit a~ unique 
issue thus far In children's rights, 
and underscores ' how this 
movement differs significantly 
from earlier liberation 
movements. 

" We're not saying that an 8-year-
old should be able to detennlne his 
or her own destiny," says attorney 
Pauline Tessler, of tile Yolth Law 
Center In San Francisco. 

"But what goes on between 
parent and child should not be a 
power relationship but one of 
benevolent nurturance, where kids 
are 'given as many choices as they 
can handle. Now that 's the ideal, 
and there's no way to legislate it-
but the most blatant kinds of 
abuses must be dealt with. '" 

The key question, of course, is 
what constitutes an abuse of 
parental authority. 

Parents have their rights, too, 
and their prerogative to raise their 
children as they see fit has always

been protected, tbe family's 
autonomy zealously guarded 
against Intrusion by the state. 

Apart from cases of severe cbIld 
abuse, wbIt warp of pare~al 
power really justifies intervention 
Into an Intact family? 

Should parents· and kids start 
drawing up contractl! to regulate 
the minutiae of family We? Will 
lawyers routinely be brought Into 
family quarrels? Some youth 
advocates bave even suggested 
that the next frontier for childre'n's 
litigation mlgbt well be ton-
sillectomies, special schools, even 
summer camps. 

This is the fractious future that 
some lawyers and judges have 
begun to fear and fantasize about-
a state of Insurrection In which 
each and every parental mandate 
would be subject to challenge . 

"People who are against 
children's rights always Invoke 
this outrageous, absolutely in-
corrigible spoiled brat who just 
says to hell with you whenever his 
parents ask him to do anythlng-
and they're afrald that this sort of 
Individual is now going to have 
power," says Peter Bull, attorney 
at Legal Services for (hIldren In 
San Francisco. "But the fact is that 
it's very unusual for a child to want 
to confront a parent-<hildren 
mature gradually, and WItH a 
certain point, they wlllt to be 
dependent. " 

The most active area of 
children's legal representatioo is 
custody battles-where the family 
unit is already breaking up, and 
the judicial mechanism is In gear. 
Echoing a growing trend across 
the country in the last year or so, 
the California legislature in 
Januarv gave courts the 
discretionary power to appoint 
attorneys for children In custody 
battles. 

Says Jonathan Weiss, attorney at 
Legal Services for the Elderly 
Poor in New York, "There's no 
longer any question that when YQU 
have kids In front of Solomon's 
wisdom, they need an attorney to 
keep themselves whole." 

"There's something very 
therapeutic, too, about having a 
lawyer for a poor person, an o~ 
pressed person, and as a con-
sequence for a child," Weiss adda. 

"A child is always told, 'Oothis,' 
'do that'; nobody sa~ 'I'm your' 
agent, you're the prtndpal, what 
you want I wi1l do. Articulate your 
grievance, and I'll try to make it 
work through the system.' " 

Consider, for example, the case 
of Alice, who was thirteen when 
her parents decided to divorce, 
about two years ago. 

Alice's natural mother had died 
when she was four , and her father 
remarried two years later; but his 
new wife never bothered to go 
through formal , adoption 
proceedings. 

Alice desperately wanted to go 
live with the woman who had been 
mother to her for almost as long as 
she could remember; but the court 

ruled that as neither natural nor 
adoptive mother, she had no legal 
standing In the case, and awarded 
custody to the natural father. 

Alice confided her troubles to her 
teacher, who In turn told the story 
to a lawyer friend, Liz Cole, then 
practicing in San Jose, Calif. 

" It really made me mad," Cole 
recalled, "so I mouthed off about 
how the kid should have some 
rights-it just wasn't fair . I said 
that while I could see how the 
mother had no standing, I thought 
the child ouSht to. N:ext thing/ I 
know, I get a call from Alice-
wanting to hire me as her lawyer."

The near-acellent productioo of 
Louis Phillip's "The Last of the 
Marx Brothers Writers" (which 
opened last night at the Old Globe 
Theatre for a five week run) at 
rirst appears to be merely a riotous 
reincarnation of Man Brothers' 
humor - a whimsical look at the 
crazy world of word play and 
vaudevillian comedy. As the action 
progresses, however, It becomes 
clear that the play, directed by 
Craig Noel, is an excursion Into 
horror. 

"Groucho Marx In particular 
had a style of bwnor which was 
just a little scary," author Phillips 
noted In an Interview. "The or-
dinary meaning of words breaks 
down and a sort of terror sets In 
that is the other edge of comedy," 
H real Marx Brothers' humor is 
scary, the Narx Brothers, imitated 
in the mind of a dying Marx 
Brothers' writer, is surely 
grotesque. And it is this that 
prevents us from laughing com-
fortably at the foWes of Jimmy 
Bryce (played by the peremiaUy 
delightful Victor Buono) as he 
grovels and expectorates about his 
filthy " Beverly Wilshire" apart-
ment, In a pathetic attempt to 
regain the glory of his bygone days 
as a gag writer. 

In no dbcemible chronological 
order the Indefatigable Bryce 
comes up with scene after scene of 
repartee and wacky vaudeVille 
routines as he tries to turn 
everything, even his misery, Into a 
gag. Appropriately, these scenes 
are from the beginning suffused 
with the horror of an old joke and 
quickly seem to go out of sync as 
the Invincible grim realities of 
Bryce's life take over again . But 

even as BryCe dies broken and 
weeping In his hotel room bed, he 
slowly pulis a whiteface comic 
mask over his head. "See, it is 
hollow on the other side - that's so 
you can stick your face In it." 
Although Bryce's dying In this final 
scene is expected, the unreality of 
the mask rescues BTYce's dYing 
from pathos Hke the twist of a knift' 
rescues a dying man from life. 
"The last of the Marx Brothers 
Writers". and especially Buono, 
presents us with an awareness of 
the hoUowness behind all comedy. 

The play is on one level a 
rollicking comedY of excellent 
quality ; but underneath this , on 
another level, is the forceful em-
ptiness of a tragedy. It is at once 
possible to both laugh and cry. The 
paradox is illustrated in Bryce's 
dying scene; his sobs originate 
from punning on the capital of 
Nebraska, "Omaha-ha-ba." 

Whether the other characters In 
the play are a real part of the 
scenic milieu or only exist in the 
mind of BrYce is a matter of 
conjecture. Certainly they are 
dependent on him, yet they often 
Initiate action of their own. Sandy 
McCallum as Julius Dwnont (from 
Julius Marx + Margaret Dwnont) 
convincingly mimics Groucho, 
Harpo and Chico ; why he lives 
IDIder Bryce 's bed and enters and 
exits through closets, though, is 
unclear. Similarly , Bryce's ex-wife 
Alice, played by Carole Marget, 
has no concrete place In time or 
space, making her entrances by 
climbing up the side of the building 
and through the fifth floor window 
of Bryce's room. Further, ln many 
of the scenes In the room Alice is 
said to live in an asylum, but it is 
out of Bryce's window that she 
jumps and dies-although she does 
no1 actually fall. Where she comes

from and where she goes is not 
revealed. Despite the difficulties 
with time and place, Marget's 
portrayal of the charming 
changeable Alice is as adept as 
McCallum's switcheroo routine 
between Groucho , Chico and 
Harpo. 

Minor characters (the only ones 
who use the door to Bryce's room) 
include an unremarkable Larry 
Ohlson as bellhop and Edwin L. 
Kotula as a 19 year old gag 
prodigy , Frank Clandenburg. 
Kotula is entirely out of place on 
the stage due partially to his 
Inexperience as a perfonner and 
partiaUy to the fact that he looks 
like he just came from a singles 
bar in a Hawaiian shirt and 
polyester suit, tennis racket in 
hand. Perhaps the character 
Clandenburg is meant to serve as a 
modern counterpoint to reality to 
Bryce 's mixed-up world , but it 
does not do anything but look awful 
and mar - an otherwise finely 
crafted production.

have ranking of their own - from

us what we think would happen if

reply.

baseball has to do is rerank its

immedi~te interest in the baaebaU 
standings, especiaUy since they 
would be unique. 

Wbat clinched it· for us was the 
fact that if the "Middle rankings" 
would once more be middle ranked 
the San Diego Padres would find 
themselves on top of the National 

Lea~ue Western Division for the 
first item in their history. (See 
standings box.) 

We were left wondering 
however, about the World Seri~

fect. After all, each team would 
aim for the magic .500 mark ...

A recent transfer from Cal Tech 

suggested that if mathematical 
plays were instituted in football 
interest would return to the 'gam~ 
at UCSD. Some of his favorite 
plays are diagranuned. 

We wonder if they'U have to 
chalk up vertical lines on the 
football fields to make it easier on 
the players to run their calculus. 

SwImmen aU wet? 
FInally. an obvious frethman 

from Los Alamos wOO had a~ 
parenUy never seen an ocean 
before in his life, offered the 
following statement: 

"I believe that water should be 
eliminated from aU swimming 
events. I believe that water proves 
a serious disadvantage to com-
petitors especially as it hinders 
their breathing efforts . I believe 
that water causes undue em-
barrassment to swimmers who are 
mistaken as surfers and treated as 
such due to their bleached hair. I 
believe too many drownings occur 
in the United States each year 
anyway, without the dangers 
inherent in having water in our 
swimming pools I 

"We presenUy face a water 
shortage. Why must we waste it in 
splashed water and any water 
which the swimmers Wlavoidably 
drink during their meets? I believe 
swimmlng eauses driving ac-
cidents due to excessive eye 
fatigue. Did you knwo that there 
were 44,500 driving accident 
fatalities in the U..nited States in 
1974? 

"Swimming in water is also very 
unsanitary when done in the 
company of more than cloee 
relatives. 'Ibere are thousands of 
waterfalls in the world already. 
Why add to theIe by accidents 
occurring at poolBide? 

"And if that doesn't convince 
you. let me tell you this. Now, I'm a 
premed so I Dow. Now. you know 
they put Chlorine in the water in 
our poois, How look at this 
equation: 

"H2O + C12 -gives you 2HCl + 
1002. 

"Now since you're not a premed 
let me tell you what it means. '!be 
water in the pools could combine 
with the chlorine to form 
HvllrtW'hloric acid which would 
burn swimm~rs severely. Did you 
know that there are 6,283 bums 
annually in the United States 
alone? Furthennore, the released 
oxygen would prove a fire hazard 
especially in an encloeed pool area 
such as our own, where if one 
cigarrette Is lit you can forget it -
we'd just be another statistic 
added to the 1,2'70.000 aMual fires 
in the United Slates causing over $3 
billion worth of damage. 

"That is why I believe water 
should be elbnlnated from the 
swlmming sport. . 

"I abo believe in motherhood 
and apple pie." 

You galta believe in something', 
all right. And we do. We know

TritQns split 
in water polo 

By Steve Gould 
Sports Edttor 

n stands to reason that in any 
sport, possessing a good wln-loes 
record insures the team of 
finishing high in tbe standlnga. Try 
telling that to the officials of the 
Whittier Water Polo tournament 
last weekend. 

Russ HaHerkamp's Tritons won 
three of four games, yet they came 
back to UCSD with the trophy for 
fifth place. Cal State Northridge 
won all four of its games to win the 
championship, while by a quirk in 
the pairings, Cal State Long Beach 
won only one of four and garnered 
fourth place. 

l.Gse By WiJulinI 
Paired in the opening roWld of 

the eight school tourney against 
Pomona-Pitzer, UC San Diego won 
handily , 13~ . Freshman Dan Evy 
scored four goals while goalie Bob 
Alee had thirteen saves. 

By winning" the Tritons ad-
vanced to round two where they 
lost to UCLA's JV team, 10-4, in a 
game much more closely con-
tended than the score indicated. 
'!be teams were tied 3-3 at halftime 
and the more experienced BrutM 
took control in the second half to 
pull away. 

Since they IQSt after winning one 
game, the best UCSD COULD 
PLACE WAS FIFTH. In the third 
game, Tom Jorgensen's three 
goals paced the Tritons to a ~ 
victory over host Whittier. 

In the game for fifth place, UCSD 
again beat Pomona-Pitzer, 10-7, ' 
with Jorgensen adding three more 
goals, as did Dave Harry. 

SlaDdouts 
Jorgensen tallied nine goals 

overaU for the Tritons. while Evy 
~d eight and Harry seven. Alee, 
according to the consensus of the 
coaches at the tournament, was 
easily the best goalie, notching 36 
saves.

UCSD will get a good indication 
of how this season will shape up as 
the team plays Long Beach Slate 
next Wednesday and USIU later 
this month. Both are victims of the 
Aztecs, who "are one w the top 30 
teams in the COWltry," according 
to Triton coach Stewart Hayes. In' 
today's game, which begins at 2:30 
on the Muir Field, Hayes says his 
team will play "very defensive, 
using fast breaks whenever the 
opportunity arises."

In the Azuza game, Tri"on 

defensive back AI Turken became 
ill due to the heavy smog, missing 
the second half. Midfielder RusseU 
Crane missed the game with a bad 
back but will see action this af-

TT picks the winners 
With the baseball play-offs already underway and the Padres out of the 

..way, the Triton Times sports staff thought it was appropriate to pubiish . 
its predictions of the winners. Even though the first games of the best-of-
five series for the NL and AL pennants were contested last night, our 
press deadline at the TT was yesterday afternoon, so last night's scores 
did nOt playa part in our choices: 

National League Pennant : Philadelphia in four games; American 
League Pennant: Kansas City in five. The World Champioqship flag will 
be raised ~ Kansas City after a tough six game series. 

other awards: MVP-NL to Red's George Foster, AL to Twin's Rod 
Carew. Cy YO\IfIg awards will go to Phil's Steve Carlton and-believe it or 
not-to California'S Nolan Ryan. Owners of the year: Padres Ray Kroc and 
Angel's Gene Autry for spending over $8 million on free agents, only to 
finish in 5th place.

"As my needs grow, the credit 
union is also growing. The 

convenience and services they

I've needed, they've been able to 

help me with In very little time." 

" Credit Line is one of the

worth procwtng for flllklnab" 
material would not Jut for more 
than 50 years at tile rate of energy 
conaumptioo projected for tile year 
2060. OJntrut this with the fact 
that de.mum constitlfts IIbout 
0.03 per cent by weiglt of all the 
hydrogen in aU the water on the 
earth. 1be deuterium in one gallon 
of seawater is equivalent in energy 
yield tomore than 300 gaUons of 
gasoline. Millions of years worth of 
energy consumption can be 
satisfied if fusion reactors can be 
made successful. 

Moreover, the products of fusion 
produce less radioactivity than 
those of fission. One <>f the major 
problems posed by fission reactors 
is the disposai of radioactive 
waste. Fear of introducing 
significant radioactivity into 
biocycles where somatic and 
genetic damage can occur is one 
reason some ecologists oppose 
widespread construction of 
reactors. The by-products of fusion 
are not themselves radioactive, 
although the neutrons released can 
make surrounding materials 
"hot. " 

A further advantage of fusion is 
that runaway reactioos cannot 
take place under reactor con-
ditions. Indeed, many researchers 
wish that it were possible; it would 
make efficient fusion III easUy 
solved problem. Runaway flsaion 
reactions obviously can take place. 
Wbile explosions are highly im-
probable, radiation 81qes of 
dangerous intenalty can easUy 
arise dlll'inC runaway. .

A ... aIlocatlaa. to KSDT .. 
revealed by leifer u a move to 
enable the radio station to 
broadcast on all four college 
campuses at UCSD. The conditions 
for granting the request, said 
Leifer, were that Kb1)'I' obtain 
regular aclvertiainl and that it 
broadcast on all campuIeS. He 
added that it bad been ageed upon 
by KSDT General Mana,er Gary 
Weinberg tbat all student 
organizations would bave free 
advertising for their events, and 
that the AS will "utilize the station 
for debates, speaker .. riea and 
general information. tt

Leifer refuted the ebarB. that the 
AS bad become an "oligarchy" due 
to the acquisition of power. 
"Appointments for the Student 
Center Board will come fnm the 
AS council, as opposed to Reg 
Feel, which baa administration 
membership. The AS baa three 
representatives frem eacb coUece, 
which constitutes a council 
majority," said Leifer. It was bi.s 
bellef that the previous aelection 
system was inconsistent and 
ineffective. 

Leifer reflected OIl the loals of 

AS potential, as viewed by 
Leifer, may become a "SIlowbell 
effect," whereby' students would 
become more knowledgable and 
stand up to the administratiOll. He 
plans to initiate pI'Ojects whicb 
entitle atudenta to accea to

Formerly, said Leifer, tbe 
Student Center Board consisted of 
a variety of factions, wbereby the 
power of the body was greatly 
diminished. "The administration 
was able to play off one group 
against another," he stated. AS President Jeff Leifer 

aaIming that the AS is being 
"pretty firm until we can actually 
see that students in the dorms can 
hear the station," Leifer said tbat 
additional funds would not be 
issued lIlW the broadcasting area 
had been increased. KSDT bad 
originally requested money tbat 
would enable the instaUation of off-
campus cables. 

Leifer cited a similarity between 
the AS and the Triton Times: "It's 
easy to criticize us."
