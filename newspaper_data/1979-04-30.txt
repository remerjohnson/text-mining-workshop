Winners in 
Four AS 
Races are 
Announced 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Associate Managing Editor 

Jane Toggenburger and 
Marcos Ortega were an -
nounced Friday as winners in 
their AS election races for 
student welfare commissioner 
and programming commis-
sioner, respectively , but 
Toggenburger may be unable 
to take office. 

The Third College Council 
and Third AS Representative 
winners were also announced 
Friday, with Mark Escajeda, 
Alexis Hernandez and Sergio 
Santos winning the represen-
tative positions and Happy 
Araneta , Sung Choe , Irene 
Flores , Ken Overton, Santos 
and Hernandez taking Council 
seats. 

Delays in the announcement 
of the winners in the Third and 
student welfare races were 
caused by grade problems. 

Toggenburger has had "No 
Records" placed on her 
transcript which, if lapsed to 
"F's," could push her grade 
point average below the 
required 2.0 for AS office 
holders. 

She has been given until 10: 00 
am Friday to resolve her grade 
problems, according to acting 
Student Organizations Advisor 
Randy Woodard . 

If she has not done so by then, 
her opposition in last week's 
election, Jon Bekken, will be 

plac~d on next week's run-off 
ballot unopposed, Woodard 
says. 

Bekken, however, says he

Bomb Threat 
Disrupts Play 
at Revelle 

By Doug Campion 
A telephoned bomb 

threat , Friday night forced 
UCSD, police officers to 
evacuate the Revelle Cafeteria 
immediately before the first 
act of the controversial South 
African play , Survival . 

UCSD police officers entered 
the cafeteria just as the play 
was being introduced, said 
Terry Christian, a member of 
the Working Committee on 
Southern Africa and one of the 
people responsible for bringing 
the play to San Diego. 

According to UCSD Chief of 
Police Hugh French , the 
officers found an object under 
the stage. The object later was 
found to be only a tool box. " I 
don't know that we would have 
evacuated the place if we 
hadn ' t found a suspicious 
object," said French. 

The search was leadbyUCSD 
Police Officer Richard Sanchez 
who is a member of the 
International Bomb Tech-
nicians Association and is 
tra.ined in handling such 
situations , according to 
French. The San Diego Police 
Department was not contacted 
for assistance. 

Throughout the hour-long 
wait, Christian continued to 
hope that the play could still be 
presented to the temporarily 
scattered audience. He said, 
"We will go on if we can be sure 
that it's safe." 

At 9: IS, Sanchez allowed the 
audience of about 200 people to 
enter the cafeteria again. The 

play went on wi thout further 
diCCiculty. 

Christian explained that the 
play , banned in South Africa, is 
being performed in an effort to 
raise money for the Zimbabwe 
Medical Drive, "to get medical 
supplies for the refugees of Ian 
Smith's war in Rhodesia ." 

"This is the first time 
anything like this has happened 
in a performance," said 
Christian . He added that 
another member of the crew 
has been involved in "radical 
theater" for ten years and has 
never experienced a similar 
threat. 

Speculating on the origin of 
the telephone call, Christian 
said, "I don't know who called it 
in, but there are some crazy 
people around." 

French said althoul~h it is a 
rare occurrence, t,)t. pus 
police department has ~ceived 
bomb scares before. He added 
that in a situation such as the 
one Friday night, there is not 
set procedure for action. "In 
cases like this," he said, • 'we 
just about play it by ear." 

Members of the folk group 
Bread and Roses were in the 
audience when the cafeteria 
was cleared. They performed 
folk songs on Revelle Plaza for 
many of the members of the 
audience in what one singer 
described as an effort to "stall 
time" for the cast and crew 
until the building could be 
guaranteed safe by the police. 

'Wall · to Wall~ Development 'Coming 
Pollution, Congestion Expected: 
Area To Be 'Another Westwood' 

This is the first of two articles 
dealing with the rapid housing and 
shopping center deuelopment 
around UCSD. 

By John Hondros 
Associate New! Editor 

- The explosion of develop-
ment around UCSD is ending 
the days when, as a young 
campus, UCSD sat surrounded 
by unspoiled coastal land and 
the nearest market, restaurant 
or movie house was miles 
away . 

The - question campus 
planners are currently 
Irapplinl with is whether the 
convenience of nearby business 
establishments is worth the 
COlt of the increued pollution 
and conlestion the new 
developments are brinlinl. 

The university area is 
"turning into another West-
wood" according to Patricia 
Collum of the Campus-
Community Planning Com-
mittee, who says the "wall to 
wall" development will congest 
and pollute the area. Collum 
cites city statistics which show 
that by 1955 traffic on La Jolla 
Village Drive will be 40 percent 
over capacity. 

The intersection of Genesee 
and La Jolla Village Drive will 
become the worst in San Diego, 
according to Collum. 

However, Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage believes there are 
some virtues in a "college 
town," such as Westwood 
where UCLA is located. He said

Parking Lot Design Poor 
Editor: 

The avera. student at UCSD 
pays SIlO towards parking 
permits during a four-year-
stay. With each student 
spendiDi this amount of money 
one would expect a fairly 
decent parkin, situation. But 
iDltead students are met with 
overcrowded parkin, lots and 
10Di walks to claslleS. Why? I 
b;ave found part of the problem 

In tile trt.oICIOI praetlees 
01 the parkiq department. 

AI one walks through the 
parking Iota lC, 2A, 2B, and the 
lot Just east of AP6M, (4 of the 
main lots), it's not Ukely that he 
will noUce the lar,e distance 
between the parked rows of 
cars, I will call this distance 
"the entrance way." Thislarae 
entrance way is especially 
necessary in the lots where the 
parkilll spaces are perpen-
dicular to the entrance ways. 
This large width 15 required for 
a car to be able to enter and 
leave the parkiDi spaces. The 
width of the entrance way, as 
measured betweea the linea 
which the cars pull up to park 
on each side, is 61 ft. Yet-in lois 

where the parking spaces are at 
an anile to the entrance ways 
this measurement is found to be 
about 54 ft . This means that 
Revelle lot lC would be able to 
add well over 100 cars if it were 
an anlled space lot, a hUle 
saviJll8. Muir lots 2B and 2A 
could each shave off 20,672 sq. 
ft. of asphalt if they were 
an,led lots. 

Not only are the perpendl-
«.'\dar lots wasteful but theY are 
also dangerous . I have 
witnessed several separate 
ocaJrrences where cars came 
to ICreechin, halts to avoid 
other cars In these Iota. The 
drivers in these lots must watch 
for cars comin, in three 
directions, while a driver in an 
aDiled lot watches for cars in 
only two directions. The third 
direction in the perpendicular 
lot beiDi that of carS traveling 
in the opposite direction to that 
of the driver, the other two are 
01 parked cars pullllll out. This 
third danger does not ocaJr in 
an,led lots because their 
entrance ways are unidirec-
tional. Cars leavinl the 
perpendicular spaces must also

block traffic in both directions 
of the entrance way because of 
the difficult angle that they 
must turn at to line up with the 
entrance way . 

Another wasteful practice at 
UCSD is in the width of the 
parking spaces. Some spaces 
are approximately 9.8 ft. wide 
while others are approxjmately 
8.4 ft. wide, and these lots are on 
the same campus! Reduction of 
the (ormer width fa that of the 
latter would save 70 ft. per 50 
car row, thus addiq 16 cars to 
each double row and at least 200 
cars to the campus lots. 

In conclusion I would like to 
ask the parking department to 
reassess its practices. I hope 
that the parking Iota which are 
now under construction will be 
angled lots, and allo that the 
possibility of converting the old 
Iota will be looked Into. I hope 
that the desip of these lots is 
not a wasteful scheme to force 
car pools. Tbe design wastes 
,as, man-hours, asphalt, 
cement space, and the 
students' money. Would the end 
justify the means?

UCSD Voters: 

In the last A.S. election 
neither Steve Schreiner nor 
Cindy Biondi received enough 
votes to be elected to the office 
of commissioner Qf com-
munications. This office has 
many serious responsibilities, 
one being chairman of the 
communications board . This 
board is directly responsible 
Cor the disbursement of 
operating monies to thevarioUII 
campus media. In order to 
perform this task in an eHicient 
and fair manner, the board 
must have some previous 
background in media. Steve 
Schreiner has the experience 
and knowledge necessary for · 
the poaition of commissioner of 
communications and for this 
reason I endorse his election in 
the upcoming run-offs.

CalPIRG ReP-QIt 
Small Car Owners 
File More Claims 
For Loss, Injury 

This is the first in a series of articles which will appear in the 
Guarclialt written by members 0/ the California Public Interest 
Research Group on matters of consumer concern. 

By Sharon Broussard 

S mall car owners have received some bad news about their automobiles from government agencies which may be reflected in their insurance costs. Two new 
repOl;ts from the Highway Task Data Institute based on 
insurance company records for 1974-1977 models confirm 
earlier findings that smaller cars have more collision repair 
losses and injuries . According to these reports. the larger the 
car, the fewer the injury claim. with the frequency of the 
injury .claims ranging widely between the two door and four 
door models. For example, the two door model Toyot1J Corolla 
and Datsun B 210 had the highest personal injury claim and 
more than twice the number of claim per vehicle a the four 
door Chevrolet Caprice Classic, th e car with the lowest claim 
frequency . 

These reports concluded that of the 1974-1975 and 1976 
subcompacts, the highest rate of collision losses and injuries 
were reported for the Chevrolet Chevette , Ford Pinto, and the 
Mustang II which had a claim frequency 20 percent above the 
average for all the 1976 models. Ford Mustand II and the 
American Motors Gremlin had the highest claim rate for 1975 
and 1974 respectively, and of the 1977 models, the subcompact 
with the highest claim frequency was the Toyota Corolla 
followed by the Datsun B 210, Toyota Celica, Chevrolet 
Chevette, Volkswagon Rabbit, and the Ford Mustang II. Two 
door cars not only had consistently more injury claims than the 
four door models; but some also had the dubious honor of being 
on the Insurance Institute For Highway Safety's list of the ten 
wurst 1978 cars for collision repair costs with the score 100 
representing the average of all cars studied in the report. The 
Chevrolet Corvette scored the highest with 221, almost twice as 
expensive to repair as the average car. 

The Volkswagen Sci rocco two door was given 216, the Toyota 
Celica two door-ZOO, Datsu1l200SX2 twodoor-175, Datsun 280Z 
sports car 171, Pontiac Firebird 170, Lincoln Mark V- 145, 

. Toyota Corolla - 137, Dodge Charger - 134, and the Chevrolet 
Camero -133. Far less expensive to repair were the four door 
models like the Chevrolet Caprice (the car with the lowest 
claim frequency) which scored 55, five points away from the 
best score of 50 given to the four door Buick Skylark and the 
Mercury Zephyr station wagon. 

Some insurance companies have conducted their own study 
on the damageability and repairability of cars. Recently All-
state Insurance Co, announced that new cuts in rates form 10 to 
30% were available for 19 19T1-1979 model cars found to have 
below average collision repair losses . These 19 cars are the 
AMC Pacer and AMX, Buick Skylark, Chevrolet Malibu , 
Impala, Caprice, and Nova, Chrysler Newport, New Yorker, 
Town and Country, and Le Baron, Dodge Omni and Aspen, 
Mercury Marquis, Oldsmobile Omega, Plymouth Horizon. 
Gran Fury, Volare, and Volvo. Allstate is one of only a few' 
firms tailoring rates to how much damage can be repaired. 
However, more insurance companies may follow suit once they 
become aware of the greater hazards of the smaller compacts. 

I f you ·are looking 'to purchase new steel-belted radial tires - you might take into consideration the findings 
of a study done by The National Highway Traffic Safety 

Administration, a government agency. Half of all complaints 
received by the center were on Firestone tires, a ratio 4x higher 
than for any other major brand. 

In a survery of owners of steel-belted radial tires the 
proportions of owners reporting problems was a whopping 46% 
for Firestone owners, 33% for Goodrich, 32% for both Goodyear 
and UniRoyal, 26% [or General and .2% for Michelin tires. 

So you still own any of the ill-fated Firestone 500 tires? Are 
you confused about whether or not you have a right to 
replacement tires? Are you getting a run around from the 
company? CalPIRG's consumer assistance may be able to help 
you get what is rightfully yours. Remember the following 

. private brands are also manufactured by Firestone and some 
are subject to the recall also. They are Shell, Union, Caravelle 
Supreme and Caravelle Double, JTW Ferrari Supreme, Atlas 
Goldenaire II, Seiberling RT78, Zenith Supreme, Holiday 
Supreme, and Wards Grappler. If you have any questions on the 
Firestone recall, call 236-1535. Mon-Fri. 1-4: 30 pm.

Custodians Scapegoat in Shift Change

miles round trip to work. I 
personally have to drive 58 
miles round trip. Gasoline has 
doubled in the last six months in 
price and the cost of food has 
gone up at least 20 percent in 
the last year. What in God 's 
name do they expect us to do? 

John Stevenson has said that 
some have said their wives will 

Jim Stronski of A.F.S.C.M.E. 
stated this couldn't be farther 
from the truth. How can we 
improve the level of cleaning 
with a couple hundred more 
people wandering around the 
halls and offices. I personally 
haven't talked to one person in 
our area (S.I .O. Ritter Hall) 
that a grees with that 

this place is a beehive at night. 
Well , if that is so what will it be 
between 8 am and 1: 30 pm? At 
least at night people aren't 
tripping over our dust mops or 
falling on a slippery noor. 
There is also another safety 
risk because most of us are not 
used to a lot of the chemicals 
these students work with. At 

the disadvantages and 
concluded it is a bad idea. 

Another thing we must not In response to a recent article 
written in the Guardian on 
Monday April 2, 1979 about the 
untimely , unrealistic situation 
of a shift change for custodians 
at UCSD campus, I must say 
this is the most ridiculous 
fabricated nonsense I have 
ever read. In the first place if 
all the reasons John Stevenson 
gave were the truth, we could 
have made a shift change years 
ago just on the basis of why he 
seems to think it would work 
now. So this leads me and many 
others to believe that this is just 
a cop-out to justify taking away 
our night differential of $26.00 a 
month . What's so hard for the 
custodians to understand is , 
why do we have to be the 
scapegoat for the university? 
We are already among the 
lowest paid people employed 
here and the cost of living isn 't 
getting any cheaper. We work 
hard for our money . 

"The people who are really in favor of this scandalous 
nonsense are the ones who won't be affected by it 
financially. They are our supervisors." 

forget is our availability to 
unexpected incidents "!:~. , 
occur in these buildings at 
night. We are not hired to be 
security guards but we can 
deter crime in our buildings at 
late hours due to our presence 
in the buildings . I have on 
several occasions had to call 
the campus police. Once two 
young kids were chasing 
through the halls and messing 
with office doors and I called 
the campus police. Another 
time there was a wreck in front 
of Sumner Auditorium one 
night and I had to call the 
campus police. And I also feel 
the female grad students feel 
safe around us not only the 
female but the male also. We 
get to know each other pretty 
well and we develop a trust 
between us. 

The people who are really in 
favor of this scandalous 
nonsense are the one who won't 
be affected by it financially. 
They a re our supervisors. Most 
of them would like to beon a day 
shift anyhow, so this is great for 
them. We haven't had a cost of 
living raise in a year and a half 
and 90 percent of the people that 
work here in our department 
have to drive at least 30 to 40 

be ha ppier because they can 
spend more time home with 
their families . He 's wrong in 
two ways. Number one, if they 
keep cutting our wages the wife 
will have to find a job to help out 
or the husband will need two 
jobs to survive. Secondly, who 
in the hell wants to be home 
with a house full of hungry kids 
and a wife nagging because you 
can't afford to take .them any 
place or put any food on the 
table? I'd rather be at work. 

As the saying goes, there are 
two sides to this coin and we 
have seen the " tails" side. So 
let us examine the "head" side 
of the situation. 

First, John Stevenson says 
this shift change will improve 
the level of cleaning, also with 
less resources. This is a non-
clinical proven statement. As

statement. A matter of fact 
they all think somebody in the 
supervisory department has 
gone bananas. Some of these 
lab workers have already 
expressed their disapproval. 

Second , John Stevenson says 
that when the custodians come 
in the morning the place is 
discombobulated and the shift 
change will allow UCSD to 
"start clean." This to me seems 
a little backward. He seems a 
little discombobulated in his 
thinking. How can these people 
come intlra clean place when 
some of them will get here as 
early as we will? The fact is, 
they will mess this place up 
after we leave (1: 30 pm) and 
will meet some of that same 
dirt the next morning before we 
can get around to our areas. 

Third, John Stevenson says 

f 

night most of these chemicals 
are put away or put out of our 
reach. During the day we will 
be much more subject to an 
accident by just merely 
bumping into someone or 
knocking over a very important 
experiment. In some areas 
there may be no such risk, but 
in others there will be. 

When this proposal was 
presented to us , it was then ' 
rejected by most at the 
meeting. There were a few 
people who had mixed 
emotions about it, only because 
getting off at 1: 30 pm sounded 
great. It was accepted in 
harmony with the fact that they 
could watch TV at night at 
home and the baseball cravers 
figured on attending evening 
home games. But even some of 
tbese people have re-examined 

I feel this whole thing is a 
egotistically motivated plan 
that was designed to benefit 
someone in supervision without 
any regard for whom it would 
hurt. If this isn 't true why don't 
they let us keep our differential, 
leave us on the swing shin and 
cut the supervisors salary by 
twice our differential? They 
can stand the cut a lot more 
than we can. But there's one 
thing we must remember: (Please turn LO page 18)

Brezhnev III Again Abortions Common Malibu H'way to Open? 
')tot~OW (AP) - Soviet Pre.ident Leonid I. 
Brezhoev ate with a .poon duriq most of a formal 
Kremlin dinner, had trouble.ipiq his name, needed 
help walldq up .tain aDd bad lapses of attention 
duriq some to~level meetings. 

WASHINGTON (AP) - A survey by an 
international population study group indicates that 
one in lour pregnancies worldwide ends in abortion, 
according to a report released yesterday . 

MALIBU (AP) - The rockslide on Pacific Coast 
Highway acted up slightly this weekend, but Caltrans 
oCficials said yesterday they still plan to try to 
partially re·open the road sometime this week. 

The picture of the 72·year-old Soviet leader 
emerged duriq French President Valery Giscard 
d'Estaing's recent visit here. It focused the spotlight 
again on Brezhnev's health, which Is known to be 
delicate. 

The report by the Population Crisis Committee 
estimated at least 40 million and perhaps as many as 
55 million legal and illegal abortions were performed 
or induced last year and said the number appears to 
be growing. 

"Some brief flurries and rock falls occurred last 
night . but of a minor nature," said Caltrans 
spokesman Milt Stark in a s tatement. 

"If the s lide continues to sta bilize and it is sa fe to

"In most parts 01 the world, the incidence of 
abortion is expected to grow as a result of wider

committ,ee said. 

Despite the activity reported Saturday night , Stark 
said the s lide was s howing signs of diminis hing for the 
third straight day.

SAN DIEGO (AP) - The curre nt boom in the mail

that p eop le can make 
educational choices ," Acting 
Dean Susan Montrose says. 
Students may turn in their 
ballots upon presentation of 
their student ID . 

A. second preference ballot 
vote will be held sometime in 
MilY to choose the na me ' that 
will be submitted to Chancellor 
William McElroy. 

The names : 
Third- Third College was 
originally chosen as the 
college's name because it was 
the third of the four campuses 
to open. Today , however, the 
name means "Third World" to

Rosaur a Sanchez , who 
submitted a letter to the Third 
College Council in favor of 
retaining the college 's name. 

"'Third ' sta nds for med· 
iation.. . it stands for the 
minority students and faculty 
who have come and left UCSD. 
It stands for the continued fight 
·of minority students on 
campus." Sanchez says , 
Lumumba·Zapata- Patrice 
Lumumba led a revolt to drive 
the Belgians from what is now 
Zaire . He became premier of 
the country , but was killed 
shortly a fter its independence 
in 1961. 

Emiliano Zapata led a revolt 
against the feudal " hacienda " 
system during the Mexican 
Revolution . He favored a 
system in which each peasant 
would work and own his own 
plot of la nd, but was killed by 
a n assassin in 1921. 

"This name provides our 
college permanent identilica· 
tion with two great leaders

according to Third student 
Mike Estrada. 
Fredrick Douglass- Dorn a 
slave. Douglass taught himself 
to read and write. After his 
escape from slavery, he 
became a well· known abolition· 
ist. 

Charles Thomas and 
Paulette Bell of the Urban and 
Ru ral Studies program endorse 
"Doug lass " becau se " he 
worked forcefully a nd 
effectively on behalf of 
removing social and' economic 
unfairness that denied full 
rights of citizenship. He saw 
education as a tool for dealing 
with social imperatives. His 
concerns are reflected in the 
mission of the college .... " their 
letter to the council says. 
Junipero Serra- Serra was a-
Spanish priest who founded the 
first mission in California. 
which still exists today in 
Presidio Park near: Old Town. 

Robert Foster, a Third

college." 
Martin Lu&her Kin" Jr,-
King, a Baptist minister, was a 
civil rights leader during the 
1960's who used a philosophy oC 
non· violent resistance to 
achieve his goals. 

Cecil Lytle , Assistant 
Professor of Music, said in a 
letter to the Council, .. his name 
dramatically embraces the 
collective views of the college 
today. The name oC Martin 
Luther King, Jr. is beyond 
reproach and needs no further 
clarification , definition or 
defense in terms ofthe college's 
ambience." 

Sequoyah- Sequoyah was a 
Cherokee Indian who invented 
an 85·symbol writing system 
for the Cherokee language. 
Eventually, Sequoyah ' s 
writing system became .well 
known among the Cherokee 
people, and was even used to 
publish newspapers . A national 
park 01 redwood trees in 
California bears his name, 

though rendered inaccurately 
(Sequoia) . ~ 

"Sequoyah was a man who 
valued education and learning. 
By naming the college 
SeQuoyah , we would be

Peace 'is Possible, Avineri Believes 
Rejectionist Front Could Follow Egypt's Lead 

VllllIal professor Shlomo Avlneri 

By Monet Payton 
Staff Writer 

Prospects for peace in the 
Middle E as t are generally 
good, and many Arab nation 
will join Egypt's willingness to 
negotiate with Israel , Shlomo 
Avineri, former Director-
General of I raeli Foreign 
Affairs aid Friday . 

Avineri , visiting UCSD's 
Political Science department 
this quarter , said in an 
exclusive Guardian intervi ew 
that Egypt has led the way for 
other Middle Eastern nations to 
make peace after over thirty 
years of war, but still face 
difficulty in getting other 
nations to follow . 

" We have, for the first time, 
an Arab leader who is ready to 
negotiate with Israel. For this . 
he is penalized by practically 
all other Arab countries 
precisely because he broke the 
taboo with Israel. " 

Avineri says he is "optimis-
tic" about Egyptian-Israeli 
negotiations, and argues that 
while Sadat is taking large 
risks, he has survived 
politica lly in Egypt a nd is now 
actually more popular than he 
was when he started nego-
tiations.

Since indicating its willing-
ness to c onduct serious 
negotiations. Avineri believe ' , 
Israel has conceded almo t 
everything Egypt demanded. 

Recognition of that fact 
should enable other nations in 
the Middle East to overcome 
their long tanding enmity 
aga inst Israel. 

" I have no doubt that 
tomorrow. Syria. Jorda n and 
Ir aq (a nd) m a ny other 
co untri es will join the 
negotiations," Avineri says. 

Still . achieving peace will be 
difficult, both because of the 
,. risks" 1 rael is. taking in 
making territorial concessions 
and because of the possibility 
that other natiOns will join what 
is u ually labeled " th e 
Rejectioni t Front," Avineri 
says. 

"The most problema tic 
p-os ition is that of Sa udi 
Arabia ," Avineri !>elieves , 
because of its friendship with 
the United States, its moderate 
pro-Western viewpoint , and the 
military supplies it receives 
from this country. . 

"Saudi Arabia has to decide: 
is it on thesideofthemoderates 
or is it on the side of the 
extremists. It opted for being 

on th e side of the extremists 
and th e United States is now 
delivering very sophisticated, 
massive military equipment to 
a country that is spitting in the 
face of the nited States ' peace 
e ffOli . 

"(It is) a country which is 
joining the rejection front 
which is led by some pro-
Soviet regim 'S like Iraq a nd 
Libya ... 

Despite the views of some 
hardlin ers , Avineri sti ll 
belie\'es peace is like ly. 

" I think the peace treaty will 
s urvive becau e Israel is strong 
enough and Sadat is a well 
entrenched leader." 

The question now . he ays. is 
whether ruture peace treatie 
will be limited . 01' " th e 
cornerstone of a peaceful 
rela tionship between Israel a nd 
the bordering countries." . 

Avinel'i , whose position in the 
Israeli government was akin to 
that of a United States 
Undersecretary of State , is 011

in Jerusalem , lecturing at

Development Questioned Council Answers 
McElroy's Latest (Continu('d from pagl' I ) 

that students benem from 
development like University 
Towne Centre becau e " it gives 
them an outlet (from the 
campu environment) without 
having to go far away." 

" La Jolla is beautiful , but 
sterile," remarked Armitage. 
" There ' no place off campus 
for students to congregate." 

Armitage said he is also 
concerned about the traffic 
increase new projects will 
bring. "I don' t want to see 
students sitting in a traffic 
jam". when they should be in 
class," he said. 

For this reason, the Campus-
Community Planning Com-
mittee voted last week not to 
support any new developments 
in the area until " the county 
gives us evidence o[ plans to 
handle the traf£ic problem," 
according to Armitage . 

Two Major Developments 
Because of their proximity to 

UCSD, two major land 
developments , one under 
construction and the other in its 
planning stages, have con-
cerned the Campus-
Community Planning Com-
mittee during the past year, 
according to Collum. 

Located south of Sa int 
Germain's between 1-5 and 
Villa La Jolla , construction on 
the La Jolla Village Square has 
recently begun, while Brittany 
Village , to be situated 
immediately east of Mesa 
Apartments has yet to be 
approved by the City Council. 

The La Jolla Village Square, 
a May Stores shopping center 
development , will consist o[ 
two separate complexes : the 
Specialty Center and Con-
venience Center. 

The Speciality Center , 
scheduled to open this fall , will 
contain a May Co. store, 
Bullock's Wilshire two 

re ta u rants and several small 
boutiques and gift shops, 
acco rding to Paul Ley ton, a 
spokesperson for May Stores. 
In a ddition, 116 one-bedroom 
and tudio housing units are 
being built in the southwest 
corner of the center, Ley ton 
said. 

These .. student-oriented" 
housing units are approxi-
mately 400 square feet each, 
said Ley ton. The rental rates 
have not been confirmed, but 
are estimated at $350 per 
month, according to Bill 
Houser , the project manager. 

The Convenience Center to be 
located north of the Specialty 
Center, will be comprised o[ a 
Ralph 's Supermarket, Sav-On 
drug store, movie theatre, 
bank, restaurants and other 
"convenience" stores, ex -
plained Ley ton. Construction of 
the center, scheduled to open in 
December, will begin this 
week. 

"This will be the first Ralph's 
in San Diego," said Ley ton. 
Ralph's , a Los Angeles based 
supermarket chain, ranked as 
follows in a recent price survey 
conducted by a public research 
group : groceries : - 1 
(cheapest), meats - 7, produce 
- 4 and sundries - 6. 

Thirty-three two bedroom 
apartments will be built on the 
second floor of the Convenience 
Center. These 900-square-foot 
units will be higher priced than 
the specialty center housing, as 
the rental rate per unit will be 
" in the ball park" o[ $500 a 
month , according to Houser. 

Brittany Village 
According to Collum, the 

Campus-Community Planning 
Committee recommended to 
Chancellor McElroy this month 
that the campus approve the 
plans for a 27 .5 acre 
development near Mesa 
A artments.

The project , called Brittany 
Village, will consist of 479 
condominiums, 78 apartment , 
a 300-room inn and 120.000 
square feet of commerical 
units . The project is supported 
by the university with the 
provision that a " large chain 
supermarket" is built in the 
commerica l center, said 
Collum. 

On Vending 

Although neither develop-
ment will be on university-
owned land, the committee is 
involved with making recom-
mendations to both the city and 
developers on projects within 
one mile from UCSD, said 
Collum. 

Initially, the Brittany Village 
plans called for 600 housing 
units and a commerical center. 
Within a year, revisions in the 
plans were made which 
decreased the number of 
residential units in order to 
provide space for an inn, 
according to Collum. 

"At first (the committee) 
opposed the hotel ," explained 
Collum, "but we later decided 
that it will be helpful to visiting 
professors and university 
guests to have a hotel within 
walking distance." 

Collum believes that the 
planned commercial center, 
with the inclusion of a 
supermarket, will benefit 
students living in Mesa 
Apartments. She added that the 
condominiums in the project 
will probably be "much too 
expensive" for students. 

The development of Brittany 
Village will , "without a doubt, " 
bring about tra£fic and safety 
problems in the University 
area, remarked Collum. " The 
condominiums will have 
underground pa rki ng .. . bu t 
most people will probably park 
along the streets, " she said_

Nancy Laga called " an 
overwhelming victory for 
students," the Quad College 
Council returned last week a 
five-point response to Chan-
cellor William McElroy's 
proposal on the distribution of 
revenue from the campus 
vending machines. 

McElroy's proposal returns 
to the four colleges approxi-
mately $50 ,000 in vending 
revenue from last year and this 
year , and approximately 
$30,000 a year beginning July I, 
1980. 

Vending machine income, 
traditionally used to help fund 
college activities, was taken 
away from the colleges last 
summer by McElroy to help 
offset a $232,000 deficit in Food 
and Housing Services. 

Laga and Keith Landa , 
Graduate Student Council 
chair, met with Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage Friday and obtained 
Armitage's upport [or a ll the 
points. Laga and Landa will 
meet with Vice Chancellor o[ 
Administration Bernard Sisco 
this week to negotiate the 
points. 

The Quad College Council, in 
its response to McElroy ' s 
proposal . asked that: 
- all the revenue from 
machines in the Student Center 
go to the Student Center Board, 
a point that was already 
contained in McElroy 's 
proposal. 
-an equation be set up to 
determine how the monies 
should be allocated among the

four colleges. The equation will 
take into account both the 
population of each college aDd a 
base rate o( distribution , 
according to Laga. 
-Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Richard Armitage 
maintain a watch over the 
funds as they are transferred to 
the colleges and as they are 
spent. 
-any portion of the· revenue 
that goes to staff come out of the 
administration'S cut of the 
funds . 
-if more machines are brought 
onto campus as new facilities 
are built, such as Third College 
Step Two, that the students 
receive a percentage of the 
revenue (rom those machines. 
- McElroy's proposal, if 
accepted by the students, be in 
effect until Dec. 31. 1980, when 
the current vending contract 
runs out. 
-there be a limit put on how 
much o(theFHS deficit be paid 
(or by vending revenue . 

Larry Barrett, director of 
Auxiliary Services, said 
McElroy's newest proposal, the 
third he' s made on the vending 
issue , drastically increases the 
student share o( the profit, but 
added that McElroy's switch 
[rom an earlier proposal that 
would have given j,fie C!~b:!S 
$18,000 less wa not caused by 
the boycott. 

Laga, however, disagrees , 
saying, "Students have had 
every effect on this issue. We 
have the most impact on the 
profits and if we contract out 
(the machines ourselves, a 
move the Quad Council had 
considered) . they'd never be 
able to touch those funds 
again. "

Car~inogens Disc()vered in Lab 
By Steve Scbneider 

&aff Wrl&er 
A Los Mleles Times story on 

carcinogenic materials in a 
UCSD lab has led to the 
discovery of similar materials 
in a second lab. 

According to state law , 
Micone said, the chemcial can 
be used safely in concen-
trations of up to 1 percent, but 
OSHA believes it to be 
dangerous even in such low 
concentrations, and ordered 
the one lab that reported having 
the chemical to dispose of it. 
The recent discoveries have 
likewise resulted in the 
confiscation of the chemical by 
EHS. 

According to the students 
who use the Urey Hall lab 
where the carCinogen was 

discovered, the danger is 
overestimated. As one student 
pointed out, carcinogens are 
lethal only if exposure is 
repeated and frequent over a 
long period of time. Another 
student stated that those who 
use the chemicals here are" not 
unsuspecting victims," but are 
fully aware of any dangers that 
might be present. 

Last September the uni-
versity was still unable to 
comply with the state 
regulations, and was given an 
extended deadline of July 10. 

The story recently reported 
the presence of a carcinogen 
called methyl chloromethyl 
ether in a laboratory in Urey 
Hall. Environmental Health 
and Safety campus committee 
ill8pections due to the Times 
story have resulted In the 
discovery of the chemical in 
another lab at Third College. 

According to Chuck Micone, 
an EHS officer, all labs have a 
standi", order to report the 
pouession of any chemicals 
listed as carcinogens. The state 
Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (OSHA) 
conducted an inspection of 
thoae labs that had reported 
havllll carclno,ens last July, 
Mlcone said, 

Avineri Criticizas 
Begin's Policy on 
West Bank Settlement 

Accordl", to Mlcone OSHA 
found many of the labs to be 
violatln, state regulations 
while ulli", the chemicals, and 
gave the University until 
September to •. either eliminate 
(the chemicals) or get 
containment processes set up, " 

Micone said that methyl 
chloromethyl ether in par-
ticular attracted the attention 
of OSHA, since the chemical is 
"especially carcinogenic and 
also very volatile." 

(Continu('d from palet' Ii) 
''I'm not a supporter of the 

present Israeli government," 
he says, adding that he 
disagrees with several policies 
of the Likud party's Menachem 
Begin, including Begin ·s 
controversial policy of allowing 
Israeli settlements on the 
disputed West Bank of the 
Jordan River. 

Avineri says Degin's 
tolerance of the settlements 
hurts the chances for peace 
with other Arab nations, but he 
is careful to add that the 
context in which Begin allows 
the settlements should not be 

forgotten . 
"The context is that all other 

Arab countries ure not 
negotiating with Israel." 

Avineri says he hasn't been in 
the United States long enough 
to Corm any opinions of the 
American student, as rep-
resented at this university, but 
he has noticed one distinction. 

Most Israeli youth have 
erved in the army Cor two or 

three years before they enter a 
university , and "because of 
this, they huve gone through a 
much more matul' ing ex -
perience than American 
students. ' ,

1979. Micone wa unable to cite 
any specific reasons for the 
failure to meet the first 
deadline, but said that "the 
people who are in possession 
the chemicals) are responsible 
(for complying) ." 

To comply with the regu-
lations, EHS has ordered glove-
boxes, in which the chemicals 
may be handled without the 
risk of exposure. Other safety 
measures will include an 
accurate inventory of all 
carcinogens in the labs, as well 
as records keeping track of all 

persons handling the chemi-
cals. Micone said. 

In addition , said Micone . a 
Chancellor 's Committee on 
Carcinogens has been es-
tablished to "set up procedures 
for looking at research that 
might involve other chemicals 
with carcinogenic potential. " 
The committee is chaired by 
Dr. Steven Mayer of the UCSD 
School of Medicine. 

Micone expressed optimism 
that with the added help th .. lt 
the committee will provide, the 
extended deudline will be met. 

AS Race Disputed 
(Continued from page 1) 
has filed appeals of that 
decision with Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Armitage, 
the Elections Commission and 
the Judicial Board. 

He claims that the Elections 
Commission should have 
checked transcripts with the 
Registrar's office far enough in 
advance of the election to 
determine whether all the 
candidates met the GPA 
qualification before the vote. 

Ganezer blames the "admin-
istration " for the delay . and 
says that on ly the adminis-
tration can get GPA infor-
mation from the Registrar. 

Woodard blames the Elec-
tions Commission for not 
asking him to check the 

~~GJfr 

transcripts soone,- thun one 
week before the election. 

The Third College problem 
involves a Registrar's errol' 
and will almost certainly be 
resolved without any of the 
candidates losing their newly 
won office , Ganezer said 
yesterday . He declined to 
identify the candidate (s) 
involved. 

The delay in reporting the 
O,'tega-Terrill Chafin race was 
caused by Ortega's narrow 
margin of victory, 52 percent to 
48 percent. 

Elections officials were 
uncertain until yesterday . 
when . 'joke·' write-in votes 
wel'e counted and di qualified. 
whether Ortega would get the 
50 percent of all vote ca st 
needed to avoid a run-off.

Ocean Satellite Data to Land Here 
By John Brock 

The world's first oceano-
graphic Satellite Remote 
Sensing Facility will begin 
operations at Scripps Institute 
of Oceanography in early 
August. 

"The Facility will track 
satellites already in orbit, " 
stated Chuck Colgan, Public 
Information Representative 
for SID . " The idea is to use the 
information transmitted by 
these satellites to obtain 
physical and biological data 
about the oceans, particularly 
air-sea interactions. With this 
system, we will be able to 
supply, in a few minutes , data 
to a researcher that would take 
a decade to gather from a 
ship. " 

Tracking System Du.e at Scripps in August 
The National Science Founda-
tion (NSF) will cover the cost of 
the first two years of operation, 
roughly $270,000. NSF is very 
cu riou to see how well this will 
work. 

color sensor. Other investi-
gators will use that information 
in bio-oceanographic studies of 
food-chain webs ." 

Dernstein listed other 
satellite detectors , such as 
thermal sensors that can 
transmit temperature data , 
and microwave sensors that 
will provide wind-speed data. 
. 'Such data will greatly 
improve the seasonal weather 
forecasts made by our Climate 

Research Group," Bernstein 
said. He added, "We can also 
monitor the erfects of pollution 
on the ocean, Other man-made 
influences, such as large oil 
spills, can also be studied since 
most of these sensors have a 
resolving power down to one 
kilometer. " 

Dernstein expects that after 
12 months the facility will be 
ready for use. " We'll have to 
use care to see who gets access 

Plants Converting Pollution 

and who doesn't, just as you 
might with any scarce 
resource," he noted. Despite 
this prediction, Dernstein 
expressed hopes that this would 
become a full-fledged regional 
facility , to be used by 
researchers outside of SIO. 

Dernstein also stated that he 
expects that many projects will 
team an on-shore Facility user 
with an oceangoing research-
ship crew, The user could relay 
important oceanographic data 
to the ship. This, he believes, 
will relieve the disadvantage 
oceanographers face now of not 
having access to the many 
earth-study satellites in orbit. 

The Facility, Cogan noted, 
will consist of a 30 ft. high, 16 ft. 
diameter parabolic satellite-
tracking antenna, plus a large 
trailer. The trailer will house 
office space, plus a computer 
which, when fed satellite 
tracking data , will process that 
data and can even give a color 
display interpretation, 

" The Facility will be located 
adjacent to the Norpax 
building, west of La Jolla 
Shores Drive on the north endof 
the Institute, " said Dr. Robert 
L, Bernstein, Ph.D. , Assistant 
Oceanographer and Principal 
Investigator for the facility . "It 
is intended to be a 'hand-on' 
type of operation where the 
machines and the investigator 
interact. The machines are 
designed to minimize the 
obstacles of those needing to 
apply satellite data for ocean 
research." 

Dangerous Chemicals Produced 

" The cost to install and run 
the Facility will be roughly $1 
Million," said Cogan. " NASA 
will 'spend $418.000 to level 
ground and install the antenna, 
and this will begin in early 
June, ,. he said. The Office of 
Naval Research is supplying 
the computer and accessories, 
and will be spending $360 ,000. 

Dernstein stressed that , 
becau e operation are block-
funded for the first two years by 
NSF, access to and use of the 
facility by qualified oceano-
graphic investigators, even 
UCSD tudents, is free. 

"Some projects using the 
Facility are a lready planned 
out ," continued Bernstein. 
"One of these will relate ocean

Saar Exhibit Maps Career's Changes 

"MTI:' one 01 the exhibits by artist DeLye Saar currently on display at the Mandeville Arl Gallery 

Records/Ted Burke 

Saxist Blythe No Specialist 
Lenox Avenue Breakdown -
Afthul' BlYthe CColunJt,~) 

Blythe. a saxophonist who's 
done time with drummer Chico 
Hamilton's group and the New 
York jazz scene, is the most 
interesting player of the 
instrument around . Where 
most saxists make the choice of 
the kind of music they want to 
play and seldom, if ever, stray 
to other styles, Blythe's sound 
is an engagingly eclectic 
mixture that he bonds together 
with the self-assurance and 
personality of his playing. His 
tone is as firm anei lyrical as 
either Joe Farrell or Phil 
Collins. yet he can, when need 
be, brandish the pyrotechnical 
verve of Sonny Rollins, the 
gruff, Cull-bodied harmonics of 
early Pharoe Saunders of Gato 
8artiiefi, and the sweet-
natured lilt of Charles 
McPherson . One shouldn't 
think that Blythe sounds like 

any of these players, though. 
Blythe sounds like Blythe 
alone, and the different ideas he 
uses compose a perfectly 
coherent style. 

With Blythe on Lenox Aveoue 
Breakdown are drummer Jack 
DeJohnette, bassist Cecil 
McBee, guitarist James Ulmer 
and several others . They 
provide the firm yet malleable 
bottom that Blythe requires for 
his extravagant solos, with 
their own sorties adding 
distinctive color and contrast. 
The tiUe track is the best 
example of this, a wildly 
shifting terrain of rich sounds 
and multi-leveled rhythms 
interspersed by Blythe's 
brilliant gymnastics. 

LelIox Avenue Breakdown is 
rough, raw, brilliant and 
1'i¥etting, and should be bought 
by anyone who's tired of the 
sugar-coated muzack being 
hawked as jazz. A.

Ethnic, Occult, 
Politics Merge 

B etye Saar, a significant California artist who began her career in 
drawing and print-making but 
who in the last ten years has 
progressed into sc ulptura l 
pie ces which she calls 
"assemblages and collages." 
combines her ethnic, spiritual 
a nd political ideas and 
experiences to create an 
impressive display of work 
currently on exhibit at the 
Mandeville Gallery. Saar's 
works range from altars a nd 
sh rines, which evoke the 
magic inherent in primitive 
rituals to sensitive nostalgic 
collages. 

A native of California, the 53-
year-old artist graduated from · 
the University of California, 
Los Angeles in 1949, where she 
studied design. She returned to 
school at the ageof 34 to work on 
graduate studies a nd a 
teaching credential. 

Saar's works reflect her 
fascination and interest in the 
occult. Symbols of astrology, 
palmistry and Tarot cards can 
be seen in her work . In her early 
works she combines drawing 
with her prints and places them 
behind window panes . Later. 
her work extended outside the 
frame and the window pane 
served as a box . As her 
interests and socia l concerns 
changed, Saar's art reflected 
that change and in the late 1960s 
she began creating three-
dimensional pieces. 

In these later pieces she 
incorporates found objects , 
such as bones, teeth , medals 
and beads. She prefers to use 
objects that are old and have a 
used look to them. Saar feels 
that an object gathers an 
energy and power by having 
been used in someone's 
lifetime. 

The "spirit" of an object 
becomes an essential element 
in the ritualistic altar and 
shrine pieces . The "Spirit 
Catcher" is an example of the 
primitive ritualistic sensibility 
of the artist. Inspired by the 
folk altars of Haiti and Mexico, 
the "Spirit Catcher" is an 

earth~olored skeletal struc-
ture, composed of erasses, 
bones and other natural

"Twiki" in Universal's Buck Rogers 

The Guardian page 13 

FilmiLynette Tom 

Buck Rogers Returns 
T o a kid growing up during the 1940 ' 5. Saturdays were the 

best. It meant running down to 
the neighborhood drugstore for 
a sack of bubblegum and 
cl'ossing the street to join the 
old gang at the Bijou, whel'e , for 
an admission price of twenty-
five cents. they could spend the 
whole day engrossed in the 
space adventures of Buck 
Rogers. Flash Gordon and the 
like. Glen A. Larson was one 
such youngster who remem-
bers those days well. In fact, he 
and Universal have elected to 
produce a cinematic resurrec-
tion of the famed space hero 
captain. Unfol1unately . Buck 
Rogers in The 25th Century 
(ails (ar short of its serial 
predecessor and inspir-atiolJ. 

The screenplay by Larson 
and Leslie Stevens is a crazy 
patchwork of James Bond and 
Ming of Mongo. Even the 
special effects by Bud Ewing 
and Jack Faggard have the 

mell of "borrowedness" about 
them. The ":Iunching of the 
spacecraft a nd subsequent 
dogfights hai l from Larson's 
own Ballieslar Galactica, 
while Richard Reams' interiors 
of the Draconian vessel look 
hauntingly familiar . . 

Gil Gerard makes a valiant 
attempt to rise above the film 's 
mediocrity with his portrayal 
of the protagonist. However. he 
comes across as a strange cross 
between Harrison Ford 's 
cynical Ha n Solo and Joel 
Higgins ' wisecracking Skip 
Carmichael (of Salvage One) , 
just as Henry Silva's per-
(ormance of Ka ne is highly 
reminiscent o( Jack Palance's 
Altila The Hun. Erin Gray's 
Wilma Deering is a coy 
imitation of Carrie Fisher's 
Princess Leia . and although 
Pamela Hensley is restricted to 
being. as the old cliche goes , 
just another pretty (ace, her 
appearance as Princess Ardala 
could have been improved 
considerably with the absence 

GalleriesiValerie Colston 

of that game trophy of a 
headdress she wears during the 
Grand Ball sequences. The 
saving grace o( this motion 
picture has got to be its 
precocious drone , Twiki. 
Played by Felix Silla with the 
multi voiced Mel Blanc, its 
ballroom antics spark a 
rea wa kening oC the mis-
chievous kid in the older 
viewers, as well as captivate 
the present young generation. 

The world that was Larson's 
childhood has undergone 
significant revisions since 
then . The neighborhood 
drugstore has given way to a 
(ast (ood chain, the bijou is no 
longer a block away and a 
quarter cannot even buy an ice 
cream cone, let alone a theater 
ticket. Universlil's Buck 
Rogers In The 25th Century is a 
perturbing anachronism o( the 
past, which prevents the 
memory o( the old serials from 
jOining its above companions to 
its natural and proper resting 
place o( quiet obscurity. 

Two Media Combine 
T his week's exhibition at the Other Gallery, located in the Humani-
ties Library , Room 1200, 
s killfully combines the 
p;,otography of Kirk Long and 
the three-dimensional sculp-
ture of Jeanine Moret to create 
an interesting and compatible 
s how entitled , " Im agel 
Architecture .. . 

The subject matter of Long 's 
work ranges (rom seventy-
year-old homes in New Orleans 
to store fronts a t University 
Towne Centre. In the store (ront 

series. Long Juxtaposes store 
front views devoid of people, in 
whic h the structu re a nd 
commercial design of the 
building can be seen without 
distraction to the contrast of 
store (ront view with the 
shopper passing by which 
co nv eys the tru ctures ' 
functional use. 

A circ le of nine three-
dimensional sculpture pieces 
combine to form a humorous 
and intimate work entitled 
.. Inside My Drawers," in which 
Jeanine Moret converts old 

drawers into shrine- like 
enclosures . 

Although the contents and 
design vary in each sculptural 
piece the image are'" 
tralized and open. And in one 
piece the contents of the 
drawer, a seaweed ladder, 
actua lly extends outside the 
frame of the sculpture. 

Moret is s ucces sful in 
captu ring the attention of the 
viewer and sustaini ng it . 
Although her drawers com-
municate an openness and 
intimacy , they are also 
abstract and enigmatic.

Raincheck Doesn't Rust Roxy Music 
T he question of whatever happened to Roxy Music 

was answered last 
Suaday Dilbt at Montezuma 
Hall, where the band appeared 
OD a stop of their first tour in 
two years. The finesse they 
brine to rock and roll has not 
lOtteD rusty or stale with time. 

each 

member has done individual 
recordings, they claim never to 
have o((icially disbanded the 
group. But since they perform 
and record together about as 
often as an eclipse. fans were 
lining up hours before the 
festival -seating show with 
plenty of beer and other 
essentials for the 

three-hour wait. 
Shortly after 8 pm the lights 

were dimmed and the crowd 
went wild. What they thought 
was a greeting for Roxy turned 
out to be a very warm welcome 
for a group called the Atlantics. 
At first this band came across 
like you'd find at a rich punk's 

Arter a few 

songs the lead singer, who 
looked like a high school jock. 
became more comical and less 
repulsive as he tried. some 
Jaggerseque mannerisms. The 
group played fast a nd hard. 
Their won songs were heckled 
by the audience with screams 
for Roxy. but their remakes of 
" Devil with the Blue Dress On " 

and " Teenage Love" kept the 
crowd content. 

After the tape of Roxy 's new 
Manifesto album played during 
intermission. the house lights 
faded and silhouettes appeared 
on stage . Guitarist Phil 
Manzanera. sax player Andy 
MackC:lY a nd new bassist Gary 
Tibbs were ready to sweat in 
their $800 Saks' Fifth Avenue 
suits. New keyboardist Dave 
Skinner a nd drummer Paul 
Thompson were more casual. 
Following shortly was Bryan 
Ferry in a £ine red vinyl suit. 
The spotlight hit his half-moon 
baby blues and thus began an 
hour and a half of a concert 
which the group seemed to 
enjoy as much as the audience. 

Roxy Music performed at Montczuma Hall ycslerday. 

The new Roxy members had 
no trouble matching the 
expertise of the others. At first 
they all basically kept their 
dignity and let their music do 
the work. The group stood still 
and played while Ferry's deep. 
rich voice sang selections off 
Manifesto. as well as their 
earlier albums (Country LHe, 
For Your Pleasure. Stranded 
and Siren) . This tour was to 
promote Manifesto and it will 
probably be in everyone's 
collection who a ttenrted the 
concert. Though these 
gentlemen (approaching 30) 
haven ' t seen puberty for quite 
some time, a perpetual young 
sparkle generates within 
them. . ,n

• Garfunkel Wastes Voice; Tee IS On 
Fate for Breakfast - Art 
Garfunkel (Columbia) 

Since his split with Paul 
Simon nine years ago Art 
Garfunkel has been searching 
for a direction, an image. 
something to compensate for 
the loss of his ex-partner's 
material. Last year's Water-
mark lp. featuring solid tunes 
by Jimmy Webb. was pro-
mising. but his latest a lbum is a 
suga r -sa turated turkey . 
Garfunkel 's crystalline tenor, 
when a pplied to th e right 
romantic ballad, is delicate and 

stirring. Fate for Breakfast's 
songs, though. are on the whole 
so boring. BORING, BORING 
that Enrico Caruso couldn 't 
make them memorable. How 
can Garfunkel stand to have 
such inanities as " Now thatl've 
seen your face/My world is a 
better place" come out of the 
same mouth that sang " Bridge 
Over Troubled Water? " On 
some cuts he tries to sound like 
the fifth G ibb brother. blata ntly 
compromising hi s style to 
retool himself as a snappy 
white soul singer. succeeding 

only in ma king an ass of 
himself. Only the plaintive 
" Miss You Nights" is worth 
listening to here . mainly 
because it 's reminillcent of his 
old hit .. All I Know ." If 
Garfunkel has forgotten what 
to use his voice for. I prefer the 
sound of silence. C Minus,

Ralph McDonald, reedman 
Tom Scott, ke y bo ar dist 

Richard Tee himself. This time 
these sessionmen have 
gathered to record an Ip that. 
despite its trendy disco 
flavorings . harkens back to the 
gospel-tinged rhythm and blues 
styles of a decade or more ago. 
Tee's arrangements are most 
appealing when he puts himself 

. at the center of the tune - his 
rhythmic piano ruminations

Hurdles Not On Field for Tracksters 
Men's Conference Dying; UCSD 
Wondering Where to Go in 1980 

ByJ.aGoelz 
SeaIor &&aft Wrl", 

On the day when UCLA meets 
USC In track and field 
competition, few track fans 
crowd the little known Southern 
California Conference Track 
Federation meet. 

Even fewer track teams 
attend. Only UCSD, UCR, and 
Cal Lutheran showed up. The 
others in the league, mostly 
church connected schools, 
"were probably at UCLA 
watching the meet," 
sPeculated UCSD coach Andy 
Sklef. 

Meet officials didn't keep 
team scores because of the poor 
turnout. Yet some individual 
scores for the Tritons made the 
trip to UC Riverside at least 
partly productive . Bob 
Peterson set a personal record 
in the hJghjump at S'4" . Chris 
Sando cleared the same height 
allO. . • 

Kevin Seeman leaped to a 
ZO'l1" long' jump and a 42'7" 
triple jump. The :1600 meter 
relay turn~ in a · 3: 32 time, 
"Just about clicking" ac-
cording to Sklef. 

The SCCTF.meet Is about to 
go the way ot the four minute 
barrier In the mile. The league 

was formed four years ago to 
gi ve un affiliated Southland 
teams an outlet for compe-
tition. It has become obsolete 
now as several of the church 
schools are forming their own 
league, an4 other schools 'are 
jumping to Division II of the 
NCAA. 

Where does that leave UCSD 
for next year? "I'm not sure 
where we'll go," said Skief. "If 
I can gel a commitment from 
the athletes we'll make a bid for 
NCAA Division II." Without 
assurance from his team 
members that they ' ll be ' 
competing seriously next year, 
the tenth year coach fears that 
Division II will be overly 
competitive for UCSD. 

His problem lies not with his 
regular competitors, but with 
'the "Dirters" on the team. " We 
have individuals who do real 
good time trials or some 
workouts at one time. Then 
that's it. I don't see them 
again. " 

Despite the athletes with 
interest or scheduling 
problems, the team still has 19 
members goinl into the climax 
of the season, the NA[A 
Division III meet at Biola next 
weekend.

Women Win in 
Tri-School Meet 

[n a three way meet that 
almost didn't take place 
Saturday afternoon, the 
women's track team outdid UC 
Riverside and Southwestern 
College in the field events to win 
the contest with 45 points. 
Southwestern was second with 
35 and UCR third with 31. 

Scheduling difficulties 
almost tied up the track 
facilities but a last minute show 
of cooperation between track 
and soccer team officials let the 
show go on as planned. 

The Triton women swept the 
discus, led by Sherre Lilley 's 
115 foot throw. Lilley also 
placed first in the javelin (86 
feet, 1 inch) a nd tied for first in 
thE: shot put (34 feet , 9 inches) 
with teammate Mary Egan. 

As a team the Tritons scored 
33 of their 45 points in field 
events, compared to River-
side 's 9 and Southwestern's 5. 
The Tritons fell short in the 
running events, though. 

The lone running victory 
came in the 3000 meter run as 
Karen Hunter turned in a 
personal best of 11 : 40 on the 
windy track. Hunter scored 
another point in a tie for third 
with UCR'sCharleneDaniels'in 
the 800 meters.

Qjai Has prestige. 

Tennis Tourney Tough 
Over the years many 

prominent tennis players have 
competed in the prestigious 
Ojai tournament on their way to 
fame in the athletic world, 
among them Billie Jean King, 
Arthur Ashe, and Tracy Austin. 
Last weekend , in the same 
highly touted tournament, four 
members of the UCSD men 's 
tennis team tried their skills 
against other college players in 
the Independent Men's College 
Division, facing competition 
from all over California. 

Each school entered two 
singles players and one doubles 
team in the single elimination 
competition . The two top Triton 
singles players, Paul Metsch 
and Billy Hein, were eliminated 
early in the tournament but not 
without tough fights . 

Metsch took on Pepperdine's 
Egan Adams, losing 6-2, 6-3. In 
the fi rst round, Hein easily beat 
the University of Redl ands' 
number one pl aye r , Mike 
Capaluto, 6-2, 6-4. Things got 
rougher for Hein in the second 
round, as he lost a tough match 
to UC Santa Barbara 's number 
two man, 6-3, 7-5 . 

In doubles the duo of Alan 
Alpar and John Rosenberg lost 
a heartbreaker to Tapin and 
Gonzales of the University of 
Redlands , 7-6, 7-5. Normally the 
Triton duo plays in the number

Run is scheduled to take place

noon. 

two spot for UCSD so the 
competition was tough against 
Redland's number one pair. 

" It was one of those matches 
that could have gone either 
way," commented coach Tad 
Yamaguchi. 

The team heads fortheNAIA 
Independent Tourney to be held 
this Friday and Saturday in 
preparation for the upcoming 
District Championships . In 
order to qualify for the national 

NAIA tournament the team 
either has to win the team title . 
at the district champioll8bips or 
have an individual player win 
the singles crown, or a duo win 
the doubles title. 

The Tritons also have a .bot 
at the NCAA natioDal 
tournament. Selections for 
NCAA are contingent upon 
individual win/loss records and 
caliber of competition that bas 
been faced.

SunDay: UCSD 
By Heatherbell Fong 

Staff Writer 
Ding-a-Ling called Trash-Can early on UC SunDay. "it's 

SunDay," said Dilll-a-Ling. " I know it's Sunday," Trash-Can 
replied. "Such a mundane remark little becomes an SDSU 

'graduate in Clownology." 
"SunDay. UC SunDay," Ding-a-Ling repeated. "Get your 

make-up on. We're taking Inch to UCSD ." Inch, the invisible 
dachshund, gave a silent bark of joy. 

Ding-a-Ling and Trash-Can the two clowns, and Inch the 
Invisible dog got to the Gym steps at Jl am. No one else was 
there. "A cheap trick," said Ding-a-Ling. "If you ' re going to 
disappear something you first have to display it. Otherwise you 
lose credibility." 

A parent wandered in from the parking lot. '.'I'm confused," 
he said, "the information I received at home said I should go to 
Warren College, but there's nothing going on over there. " He 
looked at Trash-Can's outfit and brightened. " I can see I 'm in 
the right place now." 

At that momenta trampoline walked by and, unfoldingon the 
grass, revealed itself as the gymnastics exhibit. There sprang 
up along the path between the Student Center and the Gym a 
number of tables manned by Christians, jugglers , skiers, 
yogies, and sea deucers. Inch shivered, and Ding-a·Ling had to 
lead him away , when someone set up a hot dog stand. 

"Let's go over to Muir," Trash-Can suggested. "Someone 
over there has a laser beam." On the way they got totalkingtoa 
couple of local residents. "What brought you here today?" 
asked Ding-a-Ling. "My car, mostly," was the answer. " Are 
you enjoying the exhibitions?" 

"I've seen a few good exhibitionists," he countered. 
" What do you like about UC SunDay?" Ding-a-Ling 

persisted. 
"It's free," said the visitor, who identified himself as Walt 

Disney and introduced his friend as Mickey Mouse. 
"Their make-up wasn't very convincing." said Trash-Can. 
For the next half hour Ding-a-Ling, Inch, and Trash-Can got 

completely lost when they were caught up in a student guided 
tour. They managed to extricate themselves somewhere on 
Revelle Plaza . 

"In the beginning ...... 
"Oh don't start quoting the Bible, Trash-Can," said Ding-a-

Lilli· 
" ... William Ritter," Trash-Can continued. 
"Wrongly," Ding-a-Ling added. 
"No, it's the history of UCSD," said Trash-Can . "It all started 

in the boathouse of the Hotel del Coronado." 
"Ooh," said Ding·a-Ling.
