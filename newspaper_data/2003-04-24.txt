In an event celebrating and rec-
ognizing Earth Day, campus orga-
nizations advocating environmen-
tal issues gathered at Library Walk 
on April 21 to promote their cause 
and provide information on vari -
ous ini tiatives for conservation. 
The various organizations in 
attendance included the UC 0 
chapters of Califorma Public 
Interest Research Group, 
Greenpeace, the Urban Corps of 
San Diego, Campus Greens and 
members of the ierra Club. 

CalPIRG director Kate 
Gallagher, one of the head orga-
nizers of the Earth Day event, 
mentioned some key points about 
what CalPIRG wanted to address 
this year, which includes the elimi-
nation of enVlronJlu::ntal rollbacks 
and halting the air pollution from 
fossil -fuel plants. 

CalPIRG organizcs this e\'ent 
every year for Earth Day. 
CalPIRG run everal enVIron-
mental campaigns, including Earth 
Day Energy, the recycling cam-
paign and Water \Vatch, which 
conduct cleanup at La Jolla 

hores beach. 
A guest speaker from the 

Sierra Club attended the event as 
well . Lynne Baker, an elected offi-
cer of the Sierra Club's executive 
committee, arrived to present var-
ious opportunities available to 
students while participating in the 
Sierra Club, including intern-
ship . 

"For students, a membership in 
the ierra Club gives you a selec-
tion of outings in narurallocations 
for you to visit narural places with 
trained leader ," Baker said. 

ierra Club, a natJonal club 
founded by John 1uir, recognizes 
the important i ues of conserva-
tion. Baker also asserted the crucial 
POint of interdependence of all 
environmental issues. 

"You can't have clean water 
\vithout open pace in their natur-
aJ erring, and you can't have clean 
air without tranSpOrt3tJon. 
Everything is Illterdependent," 
Baker said.

BRIEFLY ETCETERA ••• 
UC Merced professor to 

research fossil fuels 
In an effort to cope with erratic fluctuations 

in world oil prices and global warming, UC 
Merced has appointed professor Roland 
\Mnston to research attematives to fossil fuels. 

In jOining the founding faculty at UC 
Merced, \Mnston says he has a goal of help-
Ing establish an "absolutely wond-class acad-
emic program" In renewable energy. 

Winston is a pioneer of solar energy uti-
lization research and is one of the country's 
leading solar power experts. His research 
Interests Include elementary particle physics, 
In which he and his colleagues have earned 
out the definitive investigation of h~'Peron 
beta decdY, a cornerstone of the standard 
model of elementary particles. 

Winston has also Invented a new diSCi-
pline of OptiCS called nonlmagmg OptiCS, 
which has revolutIOnized solar energy utiliza-
tion because nonlmagmg solar collectors 
don't need to trac the sun. 

As a founding faculty member at UC 
Merced, Winston's responsibilities will extend 
beyond teaching and research. Once he 
be~ins work in July 2003, he Will help the 
diVisional deans plan academic programs and 
recruit the initial complement of faculty, 
emphasiZing the creation of Interdisaplinary 
research teams. 

Winston, who is a professor in the division 
of natural sciences, went to UC Merced from 
the University of Chicago, where he taught and 
conducted research for the past 39 years. For 
six years, he chaired the department of physics. 

Researchers find similarity 
among certain diseases 
UC Irvine researchers have discovered an 

Important structural similanty in the tOXiC mol-
ecules believed to trigger cell damage In dis-
eases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, 
Huntington's, type II diabetes and 00, sug-
gesting that a single therapy could combat 
these different ailments. 

Duong the progression of these degenera-
we diseases, oligomer molecules consfitute 

the tOXIC element that tnggers the damage of 
healthy cells. In the UCi study, the researchers 
applied an oligomer-specific antibody to amy-
loid proteins that have been Identified In 

Alzhe!me~s, Parkinson's, Huntington's, type II 
diabetes and pnon-related disease. They 
found that the antibody bound only With the 
oligomer molecules, but did not bind With the 
normal amylOid proteins or amylOid mole-
cules In the fibrils. This was true across differ-
ent diseases, even though the proteins that 
make up the molecules In these diseases are 
distinct 

The UCi research team also found that

the oligomer-specific anti-body blocked the 
oligomers' abilities to kill cultured neuronal 
cells in all of the protein groups they studied. 
If the oligomer-specific antibody has the 
same protective effect in humans, it may be 
possible to develop a vaccine that will simul-
taneously protect people against several dif-
ferent degenerative diseases. 

The study appears in the April 18 issue of 
Sdence. 

New technique pinpoints 
crucial areas of the brain 

A team of researchers led by cognitive sci-
entist and UCSD professor Elizabeth Bates 
has developed a novel new brain imagin~ 
technique that produces maps that 1ight up 
the specific areas of the brain that are most 
crUCial for normal functioning during critical 
brain activities. 

According to Bates, the new technique, 
known as Voxel-based LeSion-Symptom 
MapPing, Will be used With structural rather 
than functional magnetic resonance imaging 
scans that locate brain damage for individual 
patients. 

VLSM is an improvement on previous 
lesion-symptom mapping techniques 
because it does not require patients to be 
grouped either by lesion site or behavioral 
cutoff, but instead exploits continuous behav-
ioral and lesion information. 

In their study, the researchers applied 
VLSM to a group of 101 left-hemisphere dam-
aged aphasic patients, using behavioral data 
from two well-studied tasks: language fluency 
and language comprehension. The VLSM 
maps for these variables confirm the anticipat-
ed contrast between anterior and posterior 
areas of the brain, while at the same time 
Implicating interacting regions that also facil i-
tate fluency and auditory comprehension. 

Discovery of the new techmque was report-
ed In the Apnl 21 issue of Nature 
Neuroscience.

apologize after hearing that people had been 
offended by the comment. Forouzandeh also 
responded to claims that the elections com-

Los Alamos labs may go up for bid 
Senator favors new lab management 

By THOMAS NEELEY 
Senior Staff Writer 

In what may be a significant 
blow to the University of 
California's hopes to continue 
managing the Los Alamos 
National Laboratorv, Sen. Pete 
Domenici (R- N.M.) announced 
on April 22 that due to the man-
agemen t candal at the lab, the 
laboratory contract shou ld be 
opened up to competitive bid-
ding. 

Domenici, who chairs the 
enate's energy panel, said in a 

speech at Los Alamos, N.M., that 
he was recommending to Energy 
Secretary Spencer Abraham that 
he take "dramatic action" to pro-
tect the laboratory's reputation 
and improve management. 

"The lab must change, and we 
must be vigilant as we in titute 
these changes," he said. "The lab-
oratory's scientific brilliance must 
be equal in its business manage-
ment. We should no longer com-
fort ourselves in the false assump-
tion that a laboratory that main-
tains the university traditions of 
Intellecnlal freedom IS therefore 
Incapable of best-in-class business 
and industrial practices. \Ve can, 
and must, achieve both of these 
ends." 

Domenici also said that he 
would still encourage the univer-
sity to join In the competitive bid-
dlJ1g, should the energy secretary 
decide to open it up. 

The University of California, 
which has managed the ew 
MexiCO laboratory since its incep-
tion 60 years ago, has been con-
frontlOg allegations of frivolous 
overspending and poor mecha-
nisms for pending oversight at

Uncen.in future: Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is expected to decide by 
April 30 on the future of the University of California's management of the lab. 
the lab that were first uncovered 
in November 2002 . 

UC President Ri chard C. 
Atkinson said in a statement tha t 
he welcomed Domenici's cri ti -
cisms and was thankful for his 
sUppOrt of corrective actions 
taken by the university. 
Regardless, Atkinson said, the 
University of Cali forl11 a plans on 
keeping its contract for the labo-
ratory. 

"On the Issue of COrnpClItlOn, 
if ecretary Abraham's deCJ\lon 
15 to compete the LA, L con-
tract, then our instinct is to COIll-
pete, and to compete hard," he 
said. 

Atkinson added that the final 
decision to compete, should the 
contract be open to bidding, 
would be up to the UC Regents 
and said that any further comment 

is "inappropriate" until Abraham 
makes his decision. 

The Department of Energy is 
expected to make a decision on 
whether or not to open the lab 
contract up to competitive bid-
ding by pril 30. 

The comments by Domenici 
were delivered the same day that 
the university was celebrating the 
60th anniversary of the founding 
of the lab and .. day after the 
D.O.E.'s mspcctor general 
rclea~ed a report CritiCIZing the

The UCSD Guardian IS published tv.ice a week at the UnIVersity of 
California at San Diego. Conlents (e) 2003. Views expressed herein 

represent the malOOty vote of Ihe editorial bodrd and are not necessar·

the GuardlOn staff. 

UCSD must make 
good on promised 
room and board 

Though Housing and Dining Services 
offers a two-year guarantee for on-campus 
housing, the surge in enrollment, demand 
and unforeseen construction delays has led 
to a housing shortage. Many freshmen and 
sophomores already find themselves forced 
to look for off-campus alternatives, not 
because they're opting to be fanher away 
from school, but rather because of frustra-
tion with a system that promises two years 
of housing, but fulfills that promi e with 
near-unlivable conditions. 

In order to receive on-campus housing, 
students are being asked to triple in rooms 
that were not meant to accommodate more 
than two. Part de perate measure to gener-
ate vacancy, part scare tactic to encourage a 
search for off-campus housing, such 
demands indicate that a re-evaluation of 
promises made to incoming srudents about 
their upcoming living situation is needed. 

Living on campus is an intrinsically valu-
able part of the college experience, allowing 
students from different backgrounds, ethnic-
ities and heritages to meet outside the class-
room environment. Friendships and bonds 
are fonned through the collecove experience 
of living and working in an on-campus com-
munity. Losing that critical aspect of social 
interaction is not only damaging to the expe-
rience of the individual srudent, bur also to 
the character of the university itself. 

If housing and dining servIces must resort 
to desperate measures, it could at least be 
more practical in what promises are made to 
incoming students. Clearly, admissions will 
continue to increase, and current plans to 
increase on-campus living spaces cannot 
possibly keep up with even conservative 
estimates of student population. If srudents 
who were guaranteed housing but elected to 
live off-campus were given financial com-
pensation for for their choice - as was done 
three years ago - it could significantly 
lessen demand for on-campus housing and 
better everyone's living experience. 

The university is under no obligation to 
provide housing for the duration of a student's 
education nor to ensure a fulfilling social 
agenda. But it is obligated to make good on 
promi es made, and under current adminis-
trative plans, that simply is not pos ible.

Miranda rights run risk of being lost 
Supreme Court to discuss rights of the accused 

By JESSICA L1NGEL 
Associate Opinion Editor 

It's a tiny little phrase that has a 
huge sigruficance in the world of penal 
law. It has been repeated over and 
over, heard on pretty much every cop 
show on television. "You have the right 
to remain silent" - it may be an indi-
cation that you're in some serious 
trouble, but it is also a sign that you 
have rights, and that no matter how 

bl~lc the situation may be, there are 
certain inalienable privileges that still 
pertain to you. 

The Miranda warnings are quite 
simple and consist of a four-part provi-
sion of privilege. They are a.s foll ows: 
"You have the right to remain silent. 
Anything you say can and will be used 
against you in a court of law. You have 
the right to have an attorney present 
before any questioning. If you cannot 
afford an attorney, one will be appoint-
ed to represent you before any ques-
tloning." These rights must be read to 
every II1diVidual as he or she is being 
arrested; If they are omitted or 
changed, then any testimony or evi-
dence obtailled will be negated. The e 
ba IC privileges were guaranteed in one 
of the upreme Court's most Important 
rulings, the 1966 case J'.1lranda v. 
Anwna. 

Those privileges may be at risk. 
The upreme Court agreed on 
Monday to hear a case of whether eVl-
dence obt:l1ned at a cnme scene can be 
used without the full 11randa Act 
warnll1gs . Although the Miranda 
warlllngs Will not by any mean~ be 
e!lmll1ated a~ a rc ult of the Supreme 
Court heanng the caloC, It IS pos~lble 
that they Will develop a test that could 
deteTllllne when tho e warnlllgs could 
be Ignored, a dark Implication for 
those valulllg II1dlvldual freedolll 
above all el e. 

The upcOiTIIng ca e II1volves 
Samuel Patane, a olorado man arrest-
ed m 2001 for allegedly VIOlating II 
restrall1lng order. Authorities clallll 

NATIONAL 

" [The Miranda warnings] 
serve as an equalizer before 
the law, ensuring that irre~ 
spective of class or sitU1l~ 
cion, certain rights are still 

available. " 
Patane interrupted them while his 
Tights were being read. After further 
quesuorung and a search of his horne, 
federal agents found an illegal hand-
gun. 

A federal appeal~ COurt ruled Ihat 
the pistol could not be used agairtst 
Palane at trial. The lower coun deter-
mined that police were only able to 
find the ~,'un becau~e they questioned 
Patane, and the que~l1ontng was done 
Without Miranda waming~. The 10th 
U.S. ircUit Court of Appeals rea-
soned that the Supreme Court had 
brought on the quesuon with Its ruling 
IJ1 2000 that reaffirmed the Miranda 
Act. 

The coun ha I ued numerous, 
often eemingly contrad,clOry rulings 
over the years on the apphcauon and 
scope ariSing from the Miranda ruling. 

As recentl y as a 2000 case, justices 
upheld the Miranda principle. But 
other rulings in the past decade have 
allowed police searches stemming from 
similar circum tance as the Patane 
case. 

T he Bush administration has 
appealed to the Supreme Court, argu-
ing that Patane volunteered informa-
tion after refusing Miranda warnings to 
keep si lent, thereby nega ting the pro-
tections promised by the Miranda Act. 
This is one incident in a long line of 
acts seeming to favor the right of the 
government to prosecute over the right 
of the individual to defend him or her-
self. Such an argument clearly over-
looks the importance of individual 
rights and freedoms. 

A founding principle of the United 
States is the catchphrase "innocent 
until proven guilty." The proof of bur-
den is ultimately on the prosecutor and 
not the defense to reach a veritable 
conclusion. In keeping with this basic 
but beautiful concept, It is II1herently 
important to protect the rights of indi-
viduals at every level of lhe soclo-eco-
nomiC stratOsphere. And it IS inherent-
ly Important to assure every II1diVlduJI 
that he or he IS not without certall1 
legal protections even when he or she 
is heing arrested.

THURSDAY. APRil 24. 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Lipsitz' otnission of Asians from speech was wrong 
Rally comments show insensitivity to plight of Asians 

horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 
Ji L et's sec [the recent mci -

dent of flyers on campus 
depicting Ku Klux KJan 

members] for what it is : an oppor-
tunity for black snldenrs, hicano 
and hicana students, white Stu-
dents, gay sn.dents and everyth ing 
in between to say we refuse to all ow 
our university to say thi is okay." 

Part of Dr. George Lipsitz's 
speech at last Wednesday's rally 
against the aforementioned flyer, it 
might be forgiven for forgetting a 
certain large portion of the student 
body in his happy coalition. But his 
inflammatory comments regarding 
the "criminal admissions policy of 
the University of California" leave 
little doubt as to why Dr. Lipsitz 
might be inclined to forget over a 
third of the campus population. 
After all, that third of the popula-
tion is the best argument, simply by 
their sheer presence, of the failures 
of not having affirmative action. 

«Since they ended affirmative 
action ... the people who have 
replaced the beautiful black broth-
ers and sisters, Latinos, Filipinos 
and Cambodians are the people 
who have come from the wealthiest 
neighborhoods in our society. We 
used to have a snldent body that 
was young, gifted and black. You 
look at the poster circulating this 
week, we now have students who 
are dumb, shiftless and slacks." 

Dr. Lipsitz, chair of ethnic stud-
ies at UCSD, might be forgiven for 
implying that, as much of the pub-
lic and popular pre seems to 
as ume, whites (and white 
supremacists) have flooded back 
into UCSD since the repeal ofSP1 
and the end of affirmative action in 
admissions for the campus. 

But let us look at the facts for a 
econd: The percentage of white 

UCSD undergraduates has been 
dropping for the last six years con-
onuou Iy. And ir hould be no mys-
tery as to who are replacing them. 

ian rudents, whose percentage 
has grown at nearly the white attri-
tion rate. 

0, what has the end of affirma-
tive action brought? Apparently, 
lazy, stupid Asian students who arc 
white upremaClsts according to 
Dr. Lipsitz. 

Maybe that 's a gross extension 
of Dr. Lipsitz's comments. But on 
the other hand, as an ethnic studie 
professor, surely he knows the 
implication of what he S3rS when 
he refers to the composition of the 
studcnt body poSt- PI. 

Dr. Lipsitz is furthermore factu-
all y wrong on at least twO points. 
Filipino undcrgraduate enrollment 
at UCSD has remained at a nearly 
cortstanr level for the past ix years 
(at five percent, with one year at six 
percent). Also, Mexican-American 
proportions have remained virtual-
ly constant, although a mall drop 
was witnessed after the rcpeal of 
SP\. 

At its best, Dr. Lipsitz's glaring 
om is ions of Asian students 111 his 
analysis of affirmative action and 
unity against free (albeit snlpid) 
speech IS ignorance unbecoming of 
an ethniC studies professor reputed 
to be one of the best lectu rers on 
campus. Dr. Lipsitz may have men-
tioned Filipino and umbodians, 
usmg them cheaply in unsubstanti-
ated rhetoric. But the Korean, 
Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese and 
Malaysian (and more) sllidents on 
thi campus are certainly not "in 
between ri "Latinos" and "Black 
brother and sister ." 

At wor t, the omi ion is the 
continuation of the ystematic 
denial of implication of Asian stu-

dents in university admissions. 
Their over-representation in the 
University of alifornia is certainly 
not due to white privilege. And it is 
not due to a lack of adversity either: 
California was a segregated state in 
the 19th century, aligned against 
the Chinese. Many of your Asian 
classmates are the sons and daugh-
ters of nearly penniless Asian 
refugees of fascist or communist 
regimes throughout East Asia. 

Despite opinion to the contrary, 
hate crimes against Asians happen 
in this country - for anyone who 
thinks that American society treatS 
Asians like everyone else, this 
writer invites them to try being 
Asian in the Midwest. 

And yet this year, UCSD admit-
ted more Asian students than 
whites. A logical conclusion is that 
racism is not institutionalized in the 
university admissions process. 
What is institutionalized is class 
warfare - the continual oppression 
of those people without a family 
background of education. Asians, as 
an ethnicity, are no harder-working, 
or lazier, or smarter, or more moti-
vated than the rest of the world. 

What America has witne sed is a 
selection bias of enormous magni-
tude - the people who made it out

of these regi mes were dispropor-
tionately the most educated, from 
the most historically connected

immigrants have made it to the

the fact that they are still somewhat 
racially disadvantaged in American 
culture (for anyone who disputes 
that, Asians are sti ll under-repre-
sented in Congress, and grossly

under-represented in corporate 
America for the number of higher 
degrees they hold). But in making 
it, they have shown that it is not 
race that plays the determining fac-
tor in admissions - it is class. 

While the historical injustices of 
American c\!lture have yielded a 
correlation between low wages, low 
education and some ethnicities, to 
address the problem from a race 
perspective is absurd when race is 
no longer the causal factor. If his-
tOrical injustice were a reason to 
bias ul1lversity admissions, why do 
we not favor students of Japanese-
American ancestry? 

To turn the injustice of class dis-
advantage into evidence for contin-
uing racial discrimination is inex-
cusable. It is cou nterproductive 
because it encourages society to use 
the rather predetermined (in the 
sense that these students ha ve 
already 12 years of education that 
will set the course for their lives) 
enrollment statistics of a public 
university as a gauge of success 
rather than the true reform of pri-
mary and secondary education to 
serve the needs of the disadvan-
taged in America. And by crying 
wolf, it detracts from real struggles 
against discrimination, such as law-

enforcement profiling, threats 
against Arabs (a nd ironically, Sikhs.

ridicule of the gay and lesbian com-
munity. 

Although it may be tempting to 
believe otherwise, Asians are not a 
model minority, nor are they the 
"si lver-spoon fed" amtocracy that 
Dr. Lip itz denounces as having 
taken over the univerSity. The chil-

6 NEWS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Hate Free Campus campaign kicks off 
Chavez commemorated at stamp unveiling 
By CARLAN WENDLER 

Senior Staff Writer 

The Hate Free Campus cam-
paign kicked off on April 21 with 
the unveiling of the Ce ar E . 
Chavez commemorative stamp by 
the United States Po tal Sef\~ce at 
Price Center Plaza. 

tudent office of Human 
Relation Director Elizabeth 
Urtecho urged the crowd to take a 
stand against hate every day. 

"\\le are committed to the 
highest standards of civility and 
patience toward all," Urrecho 
said. "Today, we ask you to join 

OHR in developing ... a positive 
campu climate for all students." 

Unecho's sta tement led into 
the main event - the unveiling of 
a postage stamp commemorating 
Cesar Chavez, the Clucanos' and 
workers' rights activist who 
founded the United Farm 
Workers Association in 1962 and 
won labor concessions for thou-
sand of migrant agricultural 
workers In CalifornIa and the 

outhwest. 
"Cesar Chavez was a man of 

strength and conviction," said Ed 
Carmona, Hispanic Programs 
Specialist for the USPS . "His life 
serves as an example of determina-
tion and humility to all of us. He 
understood the hardships of work-
ing people and fought hard to 
bring about justice and quality of 
life for them and their families ." 

April 23 marked the 10th 
anniversary of Cesar Chavez's 
passing; being deceased for 10 
years is one of the main prerequi-
sites the USPS has placed on sub-

T~Cf Huff/Guardian 
Hail cesar: Director of Campus Relations Irma Valesco-Martinez and Director of 
the Student Office of Human Relations Elizabeth Urtecho unveil the stamp. 

jects for commemorative stamps, 
Carmona said. The immediate 
issuance of the stamp following 
this anniversary underscores the 
tremendous importance Cesar 
Chavez has in U .S. history. 

"The Cesar E. Chavez com-
memorative stamp is a powerful 
vehicle to introduce a new gener-
ation of Americans to his vital 
legacy, teaching them that 
through determination and hard 
worlc, they can improve their own 
lives and their own communities," 
Cannona said. 

Other events during this week's 
Hate Free Campus campaign 
included an art exhibit tided 
"Taking a Stand" by Vi~ana 
Lombrow on April 22 . 

Later in the week, a hate 
crimes conference featuring many 
local law enforcement officials was 
held on April 23. 

The Multicultural Food 
Festival will be held on Library 
Walk at noon on April 25, where 
ethnic foods prepared by Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 
organizations will be showcased. 

Appeal: WCTV show basis of grievance 
cantin u.ed frCJm page I 

declined to comment. 
"Everythmg was deemed 

acceptable by the judicial board 
chair," said Enk Smith, who served 
as Kitamura's counsel. "[Watts] is 
entitled to an appeal. Everything is 
being done by the books." 

Warts felt that the judicial 
board had an "outright bias" 
against him. Watts claimed that 
one member of the judicial board, 
Debra Westervelr, actively cam-
paigned against him during the 
elections on behalf of his opponent 
and ran against Aaron Shembein, 
another candidate on his Warren 
Revolution slate, for the office of 
WCSC vice president external. 
Westervelt won the election. 

"This is akin to a member of 
the Supreme Court running for 
vice president under Al Gore, yet 
still acting as a voting member of 
the court when Busb v. Cort came 

up," Watts said. 
In addition, Warts claimed that 

he was nOt presented with the evi-
dence against him 24 hours ahead 
of his hearing and that evidence 
was added against him just hours 
before the hearing, thus ~olating 
procedural bylaws. 

"I have discussed the case wi th 
Sl1Ident Lega.l Services, who has 
assured me that my constitutional 
due process rights have been vio-
lated, and that the hearing was a 
mockery," Watts said. 

In the initial hearing, the 
Warren College Judicial Board, in 
a three-to-one decision, found that 
Warts had violated bylaws by cam-
paigning on his Warren College 
Television show "Perfect Vision." 

The majority opinion of the 
judicial board said that Warren 
College Television was owned by 
Warren College, and therefore 
Watts had ~olated Warren 

College election bylaw article rv, 
section B.2.j, which states : "It 
shall be a violation of the 
Election Bylaws for any candi-
date, and/or slate, to use of 
Warren College offices, services, 
enterprises or equipment 'for 
advocation of a candidate or slate 
at any time.' 

Watts and his counsel, student 
advocate Robert Forouzandeh, 
argued that Watts' television show 
was an ecLtorial that made it exempt 
from the bylaws. In addition, Watts 
and Forouzandeh argued that 
Warren College Television is fund-
ed by Residential Life, which is a 
separate entity from Warren 
College, and therefore not a viola-
tion of the election bylaws. 

Should the appeal be rejected, 
lim Alexander would become 
WCSC president.

Lunches: Veggie club back on Wednesdays 
conunued frCJm page I 

mistic that the settlemtnt is fair to 
the club as well as the permanent 
food vendors. 

"The compromise is that their 
service was frequent enough to 
help students who wanted a vege-
tarian lunch, but that it isn't often 
enough to tilt the business of our 
vendors," said University Centers 
Director Gary Ratcliff. "It's nice 
to see they came to a resolution." 

Before the lunch service at the 
Sl1Ident Center was put on hiatus in 
late March, the organization oper-
ated its lunch seJVice three times 
per week. Rob Porter, the owner 
and operator of Porter's Pub, had 
brought the issue to Ratcliff's anen-
tion once he started noticing that 
the vegetarian lunches "looked like 
a restaurant open for businessM and 
that it was unfair for campus ven-
dors to adhere to certam health 
codes while the club did not. 

According to university policy 
regarding "Temporary Food 
Facilities for On-Campus 
Groups," campus organizations 
may be operated at a maximum of 
three days per quarter. 

The club was able to sway 
Environmental Health and Safety 
official Jon Schmidt toward a com-
promise for more frequent service 
than three times per quarter, 
Ratcliff said, because the group pre-
pares its food at a county-inspected, 
off-campus facility. The club con-
tended that their preparation facili -
ty in Pacific Beach is more on par 
with the soicter health guidelines 
of a pennanent facility.

Supporters of the vegeurian

the once-a-week compromise. 

"I really missed it when it was 
gone," aid staff member Ted 

O'Connor. "It would be really 
cool ifitwas five times a week." 

Another patron said he thinks 
the Vegetarian Club and Vedic 
Culture Society's presence on cam-
pus will convince other vendors to 
serve healthier, less-expensive food. 

"Regulations aside, this IS great 
food and good competition for 
others," said Chandler Jones, a 
nonaffiliate who worles in La Jolla . 
"I'd recommend others uke a 
look at the club's success." 

O'Connor says he comes to the 
club's lunches for the "delicious 
food, cheap prices and friendly 
people." 

The Vegetarian Club and 
Vedic Culture Society's lunch is 
available on Wednesdays from 
noon to 2 p.m. at the second floor

In addition to pollution of the

Population Reduction and Earth

informational flyers and free con-

to an informational

importance of 
Earth Day. 

Every day should be

Greenpeace promotes the con-

Greenpeace. Among the initiatives 
taken is the Clean Energy Green

under possible implementation by 
UC Regents for nine months. 

"The best change we can make is 
at the UC level. We're asking [the

Alamos: Energy secretary to 
make decision by April 30 

continued from page 3 
tion, the report cited the spending 
of $3.5 million on an internal audit 
that did not meet DOE standards. 

Officials at Los Alamos were 
quick to respond to the report, 
emphasizing that the period 
examined by the inspector general 
was prior to when the university 
began to institute changes, and 
that the travel and meal spending 
were in line with federal guide-
lines. 

"We must take strong exception 
to the conclusions of this particu.lar 
report," said Los Alamos ational 
Laboratory Interim Director 
George P. Nanos in a statement. 
"We believe the laboratory's opera-
tions related to meal and travel 
costs, and the operation of its 
audits and assessments function, 
are consistent with its contract. We 
also believe we have been consis-
tent with the requirements of fed-
eral travel regulations and other 
federal requirementS and guidance 
for allowable and unallowa ble 
costs." 

Despite the inspector general's 
report, officials at Los Alamos are 
encouraged by what they see as 
acknowledgement of changes and 
improvements made at the lab. 

"We believe we've had positive 
feedback both from the Deparonent 
of Energy and from members of 
Congress dwing the Congressional 
hearings," said Linn Tyler, a spokes-
woman for the lab. "They have 
noticed the changes we are malc:ing. 
They have said that we are moving 
in the right direction and they have 
been complimentary." 

The University of California 
has funded its own Independent 
audits, and released the findings of 
seven reports conducted by Ernst 
& Young later in the day on April 
21, all of wluch suggest ch~nges to 
programs and accounting method . 

Another report, released April 
10 and conducted by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the uru -

versity's audit firm, flagged only 
one potentially inappropriate trans-
action that amounted to $14,530 of 
a tota l 52 .26 bi ll ion in procurement 
from October 2000 to September 
2002. 

Other potentially inappropriate 
transactions included the purchase 
of 2,46 1 pairs of hoes, 1,410 jack-
ets and 6,899 bottles of hand lotion 
in addition to camping and hunting 
supplies. 

In light of 
Domenici's 
comments and 
the inspector 
genera I's report, 
speculation has 
grown as to 
who may - if 
the contract is 
opened up -
be potential 
bidders. 

Battelle, 
which manages 

Pete Domenici 
U.5. Senator, 

R-New Mexico 

four national laboratories, may be a 
competitor, as may Locltheed 
Martin, which manages one labora-
tory. 

The University of Texas system 
and the University of New Mexico 
are also both considered possible 
contenders, perhaps proposing a 
joint management contract as 
reported on April 23 in the San 
Frfl1lCisco Chronic/to 

Univer ity of Texas official 
called speculation "premature" but 
said they have been following news 
about the 13 b. 

"As of right now, there hasn't 
been any decision about what to do 
with the Energy Department -
whether they're going to take bids or 
not," said Monty Jones, a spokesman 
for the University of Texas. 

Jones aid the university's board

decision .

THURSDAY. APRIL 24.2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

J ! 

cou~ of Vwgin Records 

The folksy heart throb brings his deep songs to USD's Jenny Craig Pavilion 

Ben Harper likes to stay true to his roots. He'll pass up a Stratocaster-the quinte sential rock guitar - for 
his acoustic Weis en born, a hollow-neck 
slide number that is the Harper trade-
mark . But, as roots grow, so has Harper's 
music . 

His fifth studio relea e, Diamonds on 
tht insidt, samples in the music of decades 
past. The Zepplin-esque heavy sound is 
intertwined with traditional African 
music, funk and reggae . Add Harper's 
voice-turned-instrument, and you have 
DiomQ1lds. 

Harper will perform April 25 in promo-
tion of D,a11UJ1lds un tht lnsldt at University 
of San Diego. 

Harper was born in 1969 and grew up in 
laremont, Cahf., a suburb 60 miles east of 

Los Angeles. Grandma and Grandpa 
I [arper ran a folk-music store, and the East 
Indian tabla, banjos and sitars that Iiarper 
discovered there became hi after-school 
life . Eventually, he began to work for the 
SlOre, but when surrounded by music avail-
able to every fingertip, it was hardly a nine-
to-five to complain about. 

Before long, music's influence in his 
young life began to manife t it elf as per-
formances as Harper grew older. Before 
long, l larper was performing coffeehou e 
series' in Lo Angeles, catching the ears of 
the music industry. 

Virgin Records came knocking and 
igned I [arper after seeing him perform 

with ' 11Ij Mahal and great blue man 
Brownie McGhee. 

And thus began the Harper musical evo-
lution. 

In 1994, he debuted Wtlcomt to th~ Cnu! 
World and was critically recognized by the 
articulate picture of urban oppression he 
painted . Tne 1995 release Fight for Your 
Mind spawned his first world tour. 
Apparently being on tour wasn't enough 
work for Harper because the material for 
his 1997 release, Tbt Will to Llvt was 
recorded while on the road. The aJbum 
tayed true to Harper's evolutionary formu-

la and was his most diverse, marure record 
to that date, showcasing bluesy shuffles, 
jazzy up-tempos and reggae rhythms. 

The next relea e, Burn to Shim was 
commercially driven by radio hit "Steal My 
Kisses." This album did nothing 10 mask 
the musical influences - Bob Marley and 
Jimi Hendrix glaringly coming to mind -
but was all ahout turning them inside out to 
create a Ilarpcr meaning and sound . 

Somewhere in the midst of all this musi-
cal Darwinism, Harper founded Inland 
Emperor Records, a ve tige of the Inland 
Empire music cenc. It is in this cene that 
Harper met mu ician Patrick Brayer. Later, 
Brayer collaborated with Harper on "The 
Will to Live" and became Inland 
Emperor's debut artist. Harper himself wa 
also collaborating as he built his own 
discography, playing slide guitar on Jack 
Johnson' "Brushfire Fairytales." 

And then, there came Dia11Wntis on tht 
[rIndt. 

For 15 years, the Harper musical mix-
ture ha garnered a doggedly loyal interna-

tional following. Dlamollds, a 52 minute 
chooling of musical worlds, will no doubt 

please his fan base and convert those non-
followers . 

"My Own Two Hands," the fir t radio 
relea e, has obvious reggae roots. While 
the lyrics do not de~ate much from the 
title of the song, Harper gets credit for 
using a clarinet in the song. 

"Amen Omen" sounds so per onal, lis-
teni ng to it lend a voyeuristic feel. A piano 
guide the track, while the strumming of 
the guitar i so brutal - eemingly out of 
frustration over losing someone - that it is 
easy to hear the finger hitting the string . 
Harper's voice is hungry, the kind that gives 
so much emotion that if there was any 
more, he would be unable to sing. 

While there are decidedly spiritual cuts, 
they are not pious. "Blessed to Be a 
Witness" and "Picture of Je us" both have 
a raw, primal sound. Voices become in tru-
ments and lyrics become secondary on both 
tracks. 

The last track on the album gives defi-
nite closure to Diamonds 011 thr insidr. If 
there was ever a musical epilogue to an 
album, tIu is it . One only ha to wonder 
what the next installment of the Harper 
mu ical catalogue will bring. 

Harper plays April 25 at the U 0 Jenny 
Craig Pavilion at 8 p.m . For further infor-
mation caB (619) 260-4600. This show is a 
precursor to a summer tour with Jack 
Johnson, which as of press time, will nOt 
vi it San Diego. The chance to ee Harper 
perform is now.

The 'original' 
Muirstock 

returns 
Muir College Council brings 

its annual music festival 
and delivers great music, 

activities and food 
By ROBERT SPENCER 

StaffWmer 

The third annual Muir tock festival, one of the biggest, mo~t anticipated free music festivals on campus, will happen 
April 25 . This year , the lineup includes sllch 
big-name acts as the B- ide Players and 
Pin back, as well as local names such as Reeve 
Oliver and Skapegoat. 

Muirstock was founded two years ago by 
the Muir College Council as a way to dispel 
the increasingly prominent image that college 
councils were good for nothing but money 
distribution. Last year's festival featured 
Sugarcult, Convoy and local boys Straight 0 
Chaser. Since its inception, Muirstock has 
become an autonomous sl1ldent organization, 
responsible for its own funding and advertis-
ing. 

The fe rival features eight bands, as well as 
a variety of pre-show activities. eth Klonsky, 
the coordinator for this years MUIr tock, 
expressed his excitement that "the event ha 
expanded its offerings" since previous festi-
vals. Last year, there was a massage therapist; 
this year, they've added a rock climbing wall, 
a henna tattoo artist, sumo wrestling suits, a 
fly wall and a barbeque. 

"The event is aimed at an all-campu audi-
ence," Klonsky said. "We want students and 
staff from all over campus to come and enJoy 
the event. Just because it's a rock concert 
doesn't mean that only people who enjoy rock 
music can come." And the best part? " It's all 
completely free. There's not one aspect of the 
event that cOSts money." 

Apparently, people like the idea of a free 
mu ic festival. ThiS year aw the creation of 
two eerily sinular events - Marshallpalooza, 
which occurred winter quarter and Eleanor 
Roosevelt College'S own music festival et to 
take place this May. As the e Muir tock clone 
emerge, the creators of this exci ring event 
have cho en to use the advertising logan 
"The Original" to distinguish it from its uc-
ce ors. 

"While we're excited that people liked the 
idea of Muirstock 0 much that they wanted 
to do something imilar," K1011Sky said, "we 
wanted people to look to 1uir as the college 
that has the original all-campus fe tival. The 
nice part about being three years old IS that 
we can acquire the money to put on an amaz-
ing event that has so much more than any 
other event." 

This year' festival has a budget of 
$18,000. 

Two years ago, Muirstock took place on 
April 20 at 4:20 p.m. - not exactly a savory 
image for university offiCials to promote. 

"Origmally, April 20 \Va cho en Imply 
because it was the only available Friday In 
April," K1onsl1' said. "Of cour e, we didn't 
hesitate to capitalize on It." 

This year the mu ic still starts at 4:20 p.m. 
with (appropriately) a reggae band called The 
Big ound. 

"For ome people, Muir tock IS till about 
4120, and if that includes some debauchery, 
the Triton Taxi is there to help. Muirstock is 
not supposed to be an image of the univer it}'; 
it's an image of students having a good time." 

The festival starts at I p.m.; the mUSIC 
begins at 4:20 p.m.

The first big mcident surround-Ing the war and the world of entertamment came when 
three lIttle country western stars 
broke rule numero uno: Don't mess

announced In a concert in London 
that thcy were embarras ed that me 
preSident was from Texas. It wasn't 
long a fter that factions throughout 
the country-western lOVIng part of 
America responded by burning 
Dllcie ChiCks CD's and dCJnanding 
boycotts. The DIXIe ChICle. 
retreated from their statement onJy 
days later under these pressure~. 
The DIXIe ChICks obviously didn't 
expect such a rc jllent response 
from the silent majority In the 

nauon. They were willing to hop 
onto the pollucal bandwagon as

appreciate Thom Yorke's music and 
his freedom of peech; [ do feel 
however that his freedom could be 
expressed more intelligently. 

Other celebrities are more will-
ing to pay the price for theIr politi-
ca l beliefs. Recently Susan 
Sarandon, best known for her 
"What has Iraq even done to us'" 
slogan, was uninvited to a charity 
event at which she was originally 
scheduled to speak. The reputation 
of her long time mate 11m Robbins 
caused the cancellation of the 
Major League Baseball IIall of 
Fame's tribute to the film "Bull 
Durham," in which he starred. 

Robbins responded with a letter 
of response saying "[hel never 
knew Major League Ba. eba ll was a 
Republican organization." 
Whether or not these types of 
insults are warranted, they certain-
ly seem to display the sentiment of 
a nation divided by partisan lines 
and anxious to e cape the contro-

ver~y and entrenched feelings that 
lie on both sides of the issue. 

A good friend of the couple, 
Eddie Vedder, recently caught the 
nations attcntion by doing just that. 
Hc cho e to take a mask of George 
Bush, impale it, lam it down and 
Stomp on It on stage at a recent 
Pearl Jam concerr. A portion of the 
crowd booed and many left the 
concert carly. Eddie Vedder 
defended his actions saying that he 
suppOrts the troops and "[ am try-
109 to be as compassionate as I can. 
[ am not sure how being against the 
war all of tlle sudden means I am 
not supporting our troops." [ am 
not sure how violently attacki ng a 
latex likeness of our president does 
anything constructive to oppose 
war. Instead of saying something 
thought provoking, or trying to 
educate the audience about the 
finer points of why the war should 
not be fought, he resorted to vio-
lent gestures.

THUR DAY. APRIL 24. 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS 9 

Activism: Presidential slander 1S 
coming from skewed views 
continued from page 8 

Vedder's actions also pose the question: 
What responsibility do artists have to their 
ticket buyers? Is it fair to assume that 
because a person enjoys Pearl Jam's music, 
they are going to want to watch Vedder's vio-
lent displays' Mer all, his fans bought tick-
ets to a concert, not a demonstration. 

I recently had a personal experience wi th 
celebrity activism when I attended a Bright 
Eye's concert at the Henry Fonda Theatre in 
Los Angeles. Lead singer Colin Oberst 
began to slander the president about an hour 
into the concert. Bright Eyes has a number 
of songs that protest our political system. His 
protest songs and the criticisms within them 
are elegantly crafted. While I disagree with 
some of the content of the songs, they have 
never offended me. I was offended, however, 
when a half-drunken Oberst holding a wine 
bottle began to slander our president 

between swigs. I found his criticism, com-
mon among celebrities, that "[Bush] has no 
concept of reality" ironic in light of the fact 
that Oberst's version of reality is a far cry 
from anything the majority of the nation will 
ever know. 

The problem with most celebrity activism 
is that it is uninformed; a bigger problem is 
that the public often wants to hear what 
celebrities have to say about current affairs. 
This creates a confused state of political ego-
ism where celebrities take on jobs of spear-
heading political movements they aren't 
qualified to handle. They insult the leader-
ship rather than address the issue. They use 
their spotlight to inflame rather than to edu-
cate. They oversimplify complex issues and 
ask stupid rhetorical questions. They get 
their face in the paper - and make a few 
bucks from it - and lose my respect in the 
meantime.

Dark gem: 'Better Luck' is exhilarating 
A haunting debut by director Justin Lin tells story of suburban teens 

By HANAHSU 
Senior Staff Writer 

By now you've heard of the film : the awards it ha won at the Toronto and the Sundance film 
festivals, the push for it to pass from 
independent to main tream, the 
controversy over its Asian represen-
tation, and Roger Eberts defense 
and praise of director Justin Lin's 
unique visi on. 

Forget all the buzz and the fact 
that MTv; which was behind 
"J ackass: the Movie" and the Bri Oley 

pears movie "Cro sroads," is the 
distributor. "Better Luck 
Tomorrow" stands on its own tenns, 
and it more than passe the te t. 

A film that can be loosely 
described as darkly humorollS and 
hcklv violent, "Better Luck 

Tomorrow" tells the story of Ben 
(parry Shen) and his three buddies 
on the cu p of adulthood in their 
Orange County high school exploits_ 
From the opening scene, BLT 
engages viewer with its knowing 
humor. When Ben and Virgil relax 
on a sunny grass lawn, talking about 
early admissions, Virgil says he can't 
wait to "get out of this hellhole" and 
meet hot, brainy chicles in coUege. 

Young adults, especially those in 
college with fresh memories of high 
school, can readily identify and laugh 
with the triumphs and trials of Bens 
paclc. Especially satisfying is the 
sense of recognition and humor 
Asian find in a film that at last tells a 
view of their high school experience 
in true-to-life details, Ii Ice the obnox-
ious overachiever Daric (Roger Fan), 
who is president of practically every 
school club. 

Asian females will appreciate the 
strong, three-dimensional character 
of Stephanie Vandergosh, who is 
both a cheerleader and an honors 
student, an Asian and an American 
(happy with her adopted Caucasian 
parents), and aspires to be a cop. 

Courtesy of MTV Films 
Teenage devils: Parry Shen (fa r nght) plays an ambitiOUS 16 year-old. Ben, 
who gets in too deep with hiS high school cohorts and lands in a great mess. 

But al 0 from the very beginning, 
BLT proves to be more than meets 
the eye, when Ben and Virgil dig up 
a corpse. Lin doesn't just perpetuate 
stereotypes and BLT is not just 
another teen movie. lowly, Lin 
breaks the model minori ty facade to 
introduce the disturbing darkness 
underneath: escalating ethnic ten· 
sions, violence and crime. Ben's 
world is not just filled with academic 
decathlon, basketball and unrequited 
love - it is also fiUed with drugs, 
guns and prostitutes. Characters 
whom we grow to love and admire, 
especially the channingly vulnerable 
protagonist Ben, prove disturbingly 
flawed, while characters whom we 
come to despise sW'J>rise us with 
their humanity. 

Lin is also successful in creating a 
visuaUy stylish film. Photognphic 
snapshot introductions of the main 
characters add to the reckless ener-
getic mood of the 6rst half of the 
film. Lin's use of SAT words as a seg-
menting and framing device cre-
atively complements the themes of 
Asian identity and life lessons, while 
it plays with viewer's expectations 

and furthers the plot. Then, theres 
the stunning rotational tracking shot 
at the climax, a moment of move-
ment and tillness in the dark, that 
lingers in the memory long after. 

The trailer proclaims "don 't 
underestimate an overac hiever," 
but there's more to the film than its 
fla shy tag line with its Asian edge. 
Lin urges u to look beneath the 
surface, by challenging our 
assumptions about Asians and giv-
ing us a film that defies being 
judged by its ethnic cast. 

With its sharp observational 
humor, startling violence and dark 
beauty, "Better Luck Tomorrow" 
hold its own as a haunting mod-
ern-American drama.

Muirstock is a sure thing for hot bands 
Don't miss great music by ReeveOliver, Pinback and B-Side Players 

By CLINTON HAYCRAFT 
Staff Writer 

Starting at I p.m. on April 25 in the Muir Quad, a great, yet formerly underutilized service 
for UCSD students will be provid-
ed - Muirstock. There are a few 
hot local acts on the bill, giving 
UC D a chance to see just how 
diverse and talented the city of San 
Diego really is, and it's free! The 
corporate pigs of the music indus-
try thrive on ignorance of such 
local underdog acts, but Muirstock 
is a chance for UCSD to be 
enlightened that an Diego doe 
indeed have a strong local reper-
toire. 

Headlining are the B-Side 
Players, a San Diego seven-piece 
who have been playing in this 
town for 10 year . Frontman 
Karlos Paez, having grown up on 
the road in Mexico with his 
father 's band, Los Moonlighters, 
knows a thing or two about 
putting on a tasteful , high-energy 
show. Paez sings as well as plays 
trumpet over two percussionists, a 
drummer, sax, bass and guitar to 
crossbreed a La ti n-rooted , 
"War"-esque, polyrhythmic dance 
groove, still palatable to rockers 
due to its riffy-ness. The B-Side 
Players are an important staple to 
the San Diego scene, since they 
are a relatively successful act that 
attempts to erase the cultural bor-
der to our immediate south. 

Another local staple and success, 
Pinbaclc, will play just before the B-
Side Players. Including members of 
the heroic Three Mile Pilot, this 
four-piece carries the torch of the 
indie, clean-guitar sound of San 
Diego, and its recent taste of suc-

cess long overdue has been due to 
its persistence as well as its talent. 
With a tOn of enjoyable songs on its 
setlist, including the radio hit 
" Penelope, " Pinback is sure to 
deliver. 

Also on the bill is ReeveOliver, a 
three-piece comprised of two 
young hopefuls (Sean O'Donnell 
and Brad Davis on gui tar/vox and 
drum , respectively) and one veter-
an of the San Diego music scene. 
That veteran on bass guitar is "0" 
(for Otis) of Flu£. Surely the hottest 
a nd freshest of the acts, these boys, 
young and old, have a sing-a-Iong 
set of clever, angsty anthems 
(including "I'm Young and I'm 

Dumb'~ with mathematically chal-
lenging indie riffs in between. 

Among the warm-up acts is 
Psoma, a freshly formed, Los 

Angeles four-piece playing dynam-
ic, melodic rock. Psoma's fronunan, 
Justin Fisher, has been involved 
wi th sllch acts as Shufflepuclc and 
Nerf Herder. 

Also to prelude is FoN, a young, 
punkish crossbreed six-piece 
(including a keyboardist) from San 
Diego, which when formed in '97, 
prided itself on its 9-year-old 
drummer, I1an Rubin . I1an just 
graduated middle school. 

Afternoon Muirstock appetizers 
will include Slcapegoat, a seven-
piece, quirlcy, sWpunlc band from 

orthern California, Unbound and 
The Big Sound. 

Muirstoclc is a perfect opportu-
nity for UCSD students to checlc 
our the diversity of San Diego's 
local scene as well as test-taste a few 
other flavors. Don't miss out!

period. Freshman attackman Nick 
Dean contributed two goals and 
one assist during the Tritons 5-0 
run. 

But in typical rivalry fashion, 
Chapman would come back with a 
5-1 run of their own. With MetOyer 
completely shut off, four different 
Panther players scored the first four 
Chapman goals in the second quar-
ter. MetOyer was able to score his 
second goal of the game on a m3n-
up opportunity to end the half with 
UCSD leading 7-6. 

Chapman carried its momen-
rum into the second half, scoring 
five Out of the next ix goals to take 
an 11 -8 lead with 9:24 remaining 
the game. 

getting off five good shot attempts, 
all but one of them badly missed 
the cage. Their only shot on goal 
was saved by Hochstein (10 saves). 
UCSD set up for the final posses-
sion in the first overtime. but 
Dean's shot in front of the goal was 
blocked with just 10 seconds 
remaining. 

Unlike the first overtime. the 
Panthers wasted no time before 
they decided to go for the game 
winning shot. Grubin won the 
face-off in the second overtime and 
got it to Donnelly. Donnelly quick-
ly circled around the net and found 
a wide-open Grubin in the right 
crease area for the goal. 

UCSD waits and hopes what 
they accomplished this season gets 
them a chance to continue their 
season in St. Louis.

The defending tournament

Waterski Classic, hosted by SDSU 
and UC Santa Barbara at the leg-
endary Horton' Lakes in Barstow. 
Calif. Ariz.ona State and UC Santa 
Cruz took home the top awards of 
the day. 

STOP! 
Just when UCSD seemed to 

have lost grip of the game. the 
Tritons explosive attack duo of 
Dean and Stensrud led the Tritons 
in a spirited comeback effort. 

Dean and Stensrud would score 
the next two goals to bring UCSD 
within one goal with five minutes 
remaining. UCSD's 10th goal was a 
shorthanded one by Stensrud. 
Stensrud caught goalie Jody 
Hochstein's pass on their man-
down clear and sprinted to the cage 
to net the ball, making the score 
11 -10. Then the Tritons tied the 
game at the 4:09 mark when 

Despite being eliminated in the 
WCLL quarterfinals, UCSD again 
showed why they should be consid-
ered for a bid in the U.S. Lacro se 
Intercollegiate Associates National 
Championship Tournament. After 
starting off with zero votes for the 
Top 25 USLLA poll. the Tritons 
hard fought all season to gain 
respect in the USLlA. 

"In a game like this, its too bad 
one team has to lose," said UCSD 
head coach Ed Jeziorski. "We've 
had a great season. I really believe 
we're one of the top 16 teams in 
the USLlA." 

Peter Mchroffled U SO to the 
men's team hump title. ralong fifth 
individually. and he added solid 
performances in trick and slalom to 
take second in the indiVIdual over-
all. David Wiens added a top five in 
the trick event to join Mehrhoff in 
leading an often struggling Triton 
men's team to a third place finish 
overall. 

Katie Ambrose took third over-
all to lead UCSD's women's team.

tinual effect of Eric Hardeman's 

- injury on the consistency of the line-
up was prominent once again. 

"Ever since that major injury, 
we haven't yet regained our foot-
ing. I will continue to try different 
combinations of guys until we find 
out what works for the state cham-
pionships," Filipponc said. 

Crew is a ream sport, meaning 
that no matter h"w strong each indi-
vidual athlete is, the races require 
eight men to gel into one machine. 

"The athletes this year are some 
of the strongest and most dedicated 
guys I have worked with, but the 
forced lineup changes in the end of 
the season where there is no mar-
gin for error have been detrimental 
to the results," Filippone said. 

Fi lippone usuaUy builds a team of 
athletes over the course of a season, 
expecting them to learn to row and 
grow together. This is why one 
major injury on the port side of his 
lineup had such an Impact. 

"The port side has always been 
our weaker side simply because we 
didn't have a lot of depth [Q sup-
pon tile top athletes, so with the 
Injury we were fon:cd lO replace 
I Iardeman With a ~tarboard rower, 
which greatly affected the rh}1hm 
in the boat," he said. 

Though the van,ity team has 
been facing problems, the no\,ce 
conunues to outrow the competi-
tion. The nOVIce four won its race, 
beating IXlth SDSU Jnd U D by 
over five seconds. Addmonall}'. the 
junior varsity eight came out on top 
leaving SO boat lenbrrhs behind. 
winmng by 30 scconds. 

"The nO\1l:C r[)wcr~ have rcal" 
gamed peed III tile b~t couple of 
races. They have become the fa~tesl 
novice crew In San Diego," 
Filippone said. "llowe\'cr, it I~ tile 
varsity that carnes the hanner for the 
school. You ca n wm all the nO\1Ce 
races and suI I lose the regatta." 

With Just three race left, 
Filippone I 011 working to get the 
V:tl'!'ity to row at the ,peed they arc 
capable of. 

"I Iardcman was back for a few 
days but a re-InJury to hiS back puts 
him out for the rest of the sea;oll. 
For the next couple weeks, we \VlII 
continue to try diffcrcnt combina-
tions unul the boat gel and IS 
ready to race," Filippone said.

Golf takes fifth in 
CCA.A Championship 

Tritons advance to NCAA 
Division II Super Regional 

By JOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD golf team compet-
ed in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association 
Championship on April 21 and 
April 22 at the Diablo Grande Golf 
Course in Panerson, Calif. 

The tournament was held on 
the Ranch course in tead of the 
Legend course for the first time 
this year. The Ranch is the harder 
of the two course , which head 
coach Mike Wydra noted as the 
reason why scores of all the teams 
involved in the tourney were high-
er than usual. 

"Weather was al 0 an issue, we 
had rain and the wind was blowmg 
in the wrong direction," Wydra 
said. 

The Tritons took fifth place in 
the tournamen t wi th a total score 
of 946, 82-over-par. While they 
truggled with a first-round score 

of 322, they came back to shoot 
313 and 311 for the last two 
rounds. 

CSU Bakersfield took fi rst place 
for the event, shooting a score of 
902, 38-over-par, wi th rounds of 
296, 307 and 299. CSU Stanislaus 
came in second with rounds of 308, 

301 and 302 for a total of911, 47-
over. 

Chico State followed in third, 
hooting 306, 301 and 307 for a 

fina l score of 914. VC Davis fin-
ished in fourth place with a total of 
917, 53-over, shooting rounds of 
304, 308 and 305. 

CSV an Bernardino came in 
sixth place, shooting rounds of 319, 
318 and 321 for a final core of 
958, 94-over. Grand Canyon came 
in seventh with rounds of 316, 329 
and 318, giving them a toral of963, 
99-over-par. CS V Domingul'z 
1Iills rounded out the eight teams 
with a score of I ,006, I 42 -over-par. 

Individually the Tritons were 
led by junior Alan Scheer, whose 
score of 23 0 (14-over-par) gave 
him a 12th-place finish . 

«Alan played great, he was only 
twO strokes short of All-Di trict 
team," Wydra said. 

Corning in econd for UCSD 
was sophomore Joe Dolby, who e 
score of 238, 18-over-par, put him 
in a tie for 17th place. 

"Joe's [74 in the econd round] 
was one stroke short of the low 
score for the second round," 
Wydra said.

agel said. 
Steidlmayer has helped UC D 

come 3 long way si nce he took over 
the helm of the Triton ship in 1999. 
In 2001, VCSD moved up to 
Division II from Division III and 
he has led them into the playoffs 
every year since then.

Overall, Steidlmayer is pleased

"Our goals at the start of the 
season were to improve and to 
make the national tournament," he 
said. "If we win the regional and 
make it to the national tournament, 
we will be assured a top-10 ranking 
and will have gone omewhere thiS 
program hasn't been in my tenure."

THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS 15 

CLUB SPORTS 
WOMEN'S RUGBY 
T he UCS D women's rugby 

team seemed unstoppable all 
year, defeating its opponents 
with the greatest of ease and fin-
ishing the regular season unde-
feated . And with two resounding 
playoff wins this past weekend, 
the label of "unstoppable" seems 
justified. 

VCSD was chosen to host 
two rounds of the National 
Women's Rugby Playoffs, held at 
Warren Field on April 19 and 
April 20. ther colleges compet-
ing in the Sweet Sixteen bracket 
included University of orth 
Carolina at Chapel IIill , avy 
and Dartmouth. The event was 
attended by a large crowd, made 
up of friends and parents from all 
over the country, and alumni 
ruggers and prominent ruggers 
from all over Southern 
California. 

The first draw of the Sweet 
Sixteen pitted the Tritons against 
UNC on the first day of compe-
tition, with UCSD coming Out 
on top after holding off UNC on 
its goal line for the final minutes 
of the match in a nail-biting fin-
ish. 

The two teams battled back 
and forth for the first half, with 
UNC scoring first with a try, but 
failing its conversion. 

UCSD's inside center Kirstin 
Hanos put the first Triton points 
on the board with a penalty lciclc., 
closing the gap to 5-3, but later in 
the half, UNC scored another try 
but again failed on the conversion. 
Another penalty kick by Hanos 
kept UCSD in the game, making 
the score 10-6 at the half. 

Realiz.ing that their dreams of 
a national title were in danger, 
the Tritons' defense tepped up 
after halftime, shutting our UNC 
in the econd half. UCSD finally 
gOt a try late in the econd after 
its forwards dragged the ball 
close to the goal line, gIving 
Kristin King the opportunity to 
get a quick pickup and dive for 
the goal hne. After stopping 
UNC's final drive, VC D took 
the match 16- 10. 

n April 20, VC D played 
Dartmouth, whose ladies were 
shocked that they won the 
Saturday game over the formida-
ble avy team. UC 0 wa al 0 
expecting to face the avy in the 
second round, ince it had played 
in the Fi nal Four the year before. 

Despite shutting out 
Dartmouth at the Champagne 
Classic only a month earlier, 

CSD knew it would be a tough 
match. 

The Tritons dominated much 
of the match, even using all avaIl-
able ubsotllte player, and UC D 
came out victol'lOUS again, hut-

UCSD's 
Maurin Wallace had 
several strong runs 
with the ball all 
weekend, including 
a diving score 
against Dartmouth. 
Candace J ackman, the 
Tritons' aggressive 
Ranker, was also quick off 
the pack, and Tina 
Evangelou showed off her 
kicking foot for several counter-
attack plays. 

Although charged up with 
their past success, the Tritons seek 
to win the national championship 
by taking it one game at a time. 
The ladies have been working on 
combining the efforts of the for-
ward pack and the back line for 
weeks in practice, and this cohe-
sion has come through in their 
games thus far. 

UCSD is now headed to the 
Women 's National Collegiate 
Final Four to be held at Stanford 
on May 3. UCSD will be facing 
some tough competition with 
Penn State, Air Force and Ulinois 
State also making it this far into 
the playoffs. In their first Final 
Four game, the Tritons are set to 
face Ulinois State. 

BADMINTON 
The VCSD badminton team 

hosted the 2003, National 
Collegiate Badminton 
Championships this past weekend. 
Twenty-two colleges attended the 
three-day event, showcasing some 
of the finest collegtate player 
from around the nation, yet it was 
the home team that took home the 
glory. 

UC D was declared the 2003 
Badminton ational Champions 
at the end of competition, with 
UCSD players fighting through 
the playoffs in every division . 

The team of Chhay Taing, 
Julian Wu, SCOtt Bering, Phil 
Bratton, Mike Do and David 
Lamb took second place overall 
in the men's competition With 
solid finishes from all the player . 
Taing was able to fight through a 
singles competition of 60 com-
petitors to make it to the semifi-
nals, in which he lost to the even-
tual champion, Wu and Bering 
made it to the men's doubles 
final, but they lost to a team from 
SanJose State in straight sets. 

The UC D women experi-
enced similar succes, with the 
team of Dede Davis, Dara Wal h, 
Riyouko Lim, Graee Cheung, 

tephanie Obayashi and Lillian 
Lai tying for first place in the 
women's competition. The veter-
an doubles-duo of Davis and 
\,valsh gave a trong performance 

in their semifinals match, beating 
arch-rivals VC Irvine in straight 
sets. In the doubles final, the 
ladies lost the first set, but fought 
back and won the second. Up II-
I in the third, Davis and Walsh 
were four pomts shy of winning 
the title, but they lost IS-II in a 
comeback by the three-time 
defending women's doubles cham-
pions from Iloward . 

With the first and second place 
performances from both teams, 
UCSD took home the national 
title by having the most overall 
points. 

ow with the national title, 
the badminton team looks to win 
the league title. The final match 
will take place on May 24 at the 
VCSD Main Gym against rivals 
Irvine and Pa adena City College. 
Both Irvine and UC D are unde-
feated in league play, but with a 
well-deserved victory over VCI at 
nationals, the Tritons are opti-
mistic about their chances.

son in years, the o. I UCS D

I n what was dubbed the "The Richest Eight econd In POrts History," professional 
bull rider Chn Shiver had a 
chance to win $1 million on April 
19. All he had to do wa sit on the 
back of a bull for eight seconds. I 
think e\'en former "\Vho \Vants to 
be a Millionaire?" host Regi 
Philbm was intrigued by the offer. 

[ don't know much about bull 
ndlng, but holding OntO the back of 
l bucking bull doe n't sound too 
easy - Stuvers didn't e\'en have 
an): lifellOes to u e to help tum. And 
after ome research, I'm sure that 
hlvers had his work cut out for 

him. Let's break down the 
matchup. 

hlvers, 24, began his profes-
sIOnal bull riding career IX years 
ago, lnd the LouIsiana natl\'e 
qUick!} became one of the most tal -
ented bull nder~ on tour. The 2000 
ProfeSSIOnal Bull Riders world 
champIOn, who IS Just 5 '5" and tips 
the scale at 14 pounds, qualtfied 
for the Bud Light MIIlton Dollar 
Bounty over the course of the 2003 
PBR ea on through an eltmlnaoon 
proces at vanous professIOnal 
rodeos. 

And hivers was to go up 
against 1,650-pound Little Yellow 
Jacket, which has bucked Shivers 
off Its back 10 the previous four 
meetings between the two and has 
only been ridden successfully 
eight out of 54 attempts. Adding 
to its already impressive resume, 
Little Yellow Jacket is the 2002 
PBR Bucking Bull of the Year. 

ShJVers chances were slim to 
none, but if riding a bull (although 
It may be as big and intimidating as 
Little Yellow Jacket) for eight sec-
onds IS worth $1 million, here are a 
couple of other sports bounties that 
should be considered with such a 
payoff. 

- Be the opposing manager in a 
three-game series against the 
Giants and not walk Barry Bonds. 
Fans don't pay to see hlln jog down 
the first-base line every three 
innings. 

ame \.here IUPUI is 
located and what the abbreViation 
stand~ for. Then say It 10 umes 
fast. 

- "fake a charge from Shaq. 
GCllIng 10 the way of the Laker 
centci in the Imddle of the lane 
woul>i11rove to he c05dy phYSically, 
but re(;clVlOg a $1 1111 II IOn check for 
the dcfenslve play hould cover the 
medl(;al bills. 

- Stand down the first-base 
Itne at U.S. ellular Field (former-
ly known as Comiskey Park) for 
OIne Innmgs and not be attacked by 
an IdlOtJC, drunken fan . 

The chances of completing 
these challenges are sltm to none, 
just Itke hlvers' shot agalOst Little 
Yellow Jacket was. Who knows If 
anyone could last the e? We do 
know, however, that the bull won 
hiS one-on-one match up, bucking 
off Shivers, who lasted Ie s than 
two seconds.

malls about hiS points at adku-

Baseball drops four games to Davis 
Tritons fall into fourth place in CCAA with home losses 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team is on 
an eight-game losing streak. The 
Tritons faced Biola University on 
April 16 in a nonconference game 
and lost 9-5, on April 16. 

Thi pa t weekend, UC Davis 
came to Triton Baseball Field for a 
four-game series against UCSD 
from April 18 ro April 20. The 
Aggies swept the TritOns, \\~nning 
the games 10-2, 9-4, 3-1 and 12-5, 
respectively. The losses sunk 
UCSD from a rie for first place into 
fourth place in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 

The Aggies dominated the 
Tritons in game one. With Just one 
out in the top of the first, Davis 
shortstop Ryan Coultas blasted his 
third home run of the year ro left 
field . ggie right fielder Dustin 
oderman led off the second inning 

With a triple and scored to put 
Davis up by two. After Davis added 
two more runs 10 the fourth off of 
two doubles, CSD right fielder 
Brett Burton tried to get the 
Tritons on track by smacking a solo 
home run to right field m the bot-
tom half, hl fourth on the year. 
The Aggtes refu ed to back down, 
puttlOg up two run In the SiXth and 
four runs m the eighth to capture 
the series opener 10-2. 

UCSD pitcher Jose a"arro 
picked up the 10 and fell to 3 -6. 

Aggte pitcher Trevor Thornton 
threw a complete game and 
Improved to -2. 

Though the Tritons mustered 
up a few more tu ts In the second 
game, the first of the doubleheader 
on April 19, they still were unable 
to overcome the Aggies' offense. 

Again, Davis cored a single run in 
the first off consecutive doubles 
from third baseman Matt 
Kawigawachi and first baseman 
David Butterworth. T he Aggies 
tacked on three more runs in the 
third, getting another double from 
Butterworth, who drove in two out 
of the three runs that inning. 

In that same inning, Triton right 
fielder David Hawk launched his 
third home run of the year to right 
center field. Left fielder Damian 
Fante also scored in the inning after 
second baseman igel Miller sin-
gled him in. Yet, Davis countered 
again, putting up four runs in the 
fourth and one in the fifth. C D 
continued to battle as Miller led off 
both the sixth and eighth innings 
with doubles, scoring off of a ingle 
and a sacrifice by Triton first base-
man Keith Albrecht. This was to no 
avail since the Aggies won 9-4. 

"\Ve're going through a tough 
time," said UCSD head coach Dan 
O'Brien. "But the only thing that is 
Important at t1us point is that we 
ha\'e a solid, hard-working ball club 
that still has something to play for 
and that continues to be our focus." 

Triton pitcher Raf Bergstrom 
went 3.2 innings and fell to 5-2 n 
the season \11th the loss. 

For Dm, pitcher Michael 
Porrer picked up the WIO and 
improved to 6-3. 

In the third game of the series, 
UCSD Jumped out to a one-run 
lead in the first, but that would be 
their only 11m of the game. Davi 
put up smgle runs m the econd, 
fourth and fifth innings to take the 
second game of the twinbill 3-1. 

UCSD hurler Byron Grubman 
pitched a complete game, but suf-
fered his first loss of the season to 

Jessica Horton/Guardian 
Needing relief: Out of the bullpen, UCSD's Logan Boutilier pitches to a UC Davis 
batter on Apnl 18. The Tntons fell to fourth place WIth four losses to the Aggles. 
bring his record to 7-1. 

In the cries clo er, Davi put up 
runs in ix out of the nine inrungs. 
The Aggies put up twO rwlS in the 
second and never looked back. 
They scored two runs III each of the 
fourth, fifth and sixth innings, and 
then c1mched the victory with three 
addioonal runs m the eighth. 

Triton third baseman Alex 
Ga con knocked his first home 
rU!1 of the year in the seventh. He 
went 2-for-3 III the game. 

UC D freshman pitcher Justin 
Suarez picked up his third loss of 
the season and fell to 0-3. 

The Aggies had 22 hits in the 
12-5 victory over the Tritons. 

After the series finale, O'Brien 
realized the challenge that UCSD 
faced over the past two weekends. 

"We can't forget tllat we just 
played two of the better tcams 111 
our conference who both admitted 
that they arc playing tlle best base-
ball that they've played all year," he 
said. 

UC D, once comfortably 10 
first place, now faces the poSSibili-
ty of not qllahfylOg for the post-
season. At 24-23 overall and 18-16 
in the CCAA, the Tritons mu t 
playa solid weekend of baseball 
agalOst CSU Stanislaus, which vis-
its Triton Baseball Field this week-
end in the final senes of CM 
competition. 

"At this point, our goal is ro get 
better and move onto next week-
end," O'Brien said. "vVe can only 
concern ourselves wilh the things 
we can control."
