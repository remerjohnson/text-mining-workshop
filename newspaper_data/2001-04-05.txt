Peace Corps Service on the Rise . 
UCSD among top 25 with graduates signing up for program 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
Staff Writer 

A recent study shows that UCSD students 
are increasingly following up their four years 
of college with two years of service in under-
developed nations. 

The study, conducted by the Peace 
Corps, recently ranked UCSD in the top 25 
large universities whose graduates sign up 
to serve. 

Currently, 38 UCSD alumni are participat-
ing in the Peace Corps, placing UCSD 20th in 
the nation. 

"The Peace Corps is a great opportunity 
for personal growth and a way to experience 
another culture," said Sandy Kim, the Peace 
Corps regional recruiter at UCSD. 

Nearly 500 UCSD alumni have participat-
ed in the 37 years since the program was 
founded by then-President John F. Kennedy. 

The high turnout may stem in part from 
the general education undergraduate courses 
at colleges such as Eleanor Roosevelt and 
Thurgood Marshall, where students explore 
the relationship between different people, 
cultures and nations. 

Kim sees a connection between potential 
volunteers and college students. 

"A lot of the students come from Eleanor 
Roosevelt College, where there is a global 
emphasis," Kim said. 

Charles Baque, acting director of the Peace 
Corps, announced the findings. 

"Through their volunteer work overseas, 
Americans throughout this country are able 
to learn more about the world in this era of 
globalization: Baquet said. 

Baquet served with the Peace Corps in 
Somalia during the ' 60s.

Emphasizes Anti-Violence 
Play based on violence in schools was 
performed by high school students Tuesday 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Staff Writer 

A troupe of 12 high school stu-
dents from the Coronado School 
of the Arts performed the one-act 
play "Bang Bang You're Dead" at 
the Mandell Weiss Forum Theater 
on Thesday night. 

The play, which is inspired by 
the actual May 1988 school 
shooting in Springfield , Ore., 
chronicles the mental state of the 
perpetrator of a high schoo l 
shooting before and after he com-
mitted the crime. Kip Kinkel was 
the 15-year-old charged with 
killing his parents and two class-
mates in the Springfield shooting.

Dynes Convenes 
Diversity Town 
Hall Meeting 
Speak rs discuss high r 
education, SATs and SP-l 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Staff Writer 

Students, staff dnd faculty gathercd Tucsd.II' 
afternoon in th~ Pric~ C~nlcr Ballroom for thL' 
second annual Diversify Council Town H.ill 
Meeting. The counCil's themc was "EmbraclIlg 
Diversity: A Campus-wide Responsibility." 

The meeting opened wi th a wt:icome ilnd 
introduction by Diversi ty Council Chai r 
Deborah Wingard, wi th opening rema rks by 
Chancellor Robert Dynes. Dynes opened thl' 
discourse on embracing diversity. 

·We don't pursue cultural diversi ty bccilusl' 
it is a noble concept, but becausc it rl'illIy docs 
strengthen the communi ty," Dynes said. 

Followi ng Dynes' remarks, Cathl'rinc 
Joseph, vice chair of the Diversity Council , 
in troduced the keynote spcako:r, Daryl G. 
Smith . Smith is a professor of education and 
psyc hology at The Claremont Graduate 
University. 

Smith said the road to cultura l diversity In 
higher education, although difficult, is pos~lbk . 

"We're liv in g in th e conscquences of 
Proposit ion 209, and on the other hand , pCOllk 
are beginning to rea li ze the importancc of cul-
tural diversity," Smith said 

Smith talked about Proposi tion 209. wh ich 
passed as Ca li fo rn ia state law in 1996 and 
ended affirm ative action, ma king it illegal to 
hire on the basis of race, sex, color, cthnicity or 
national origin. 

Smith spoke of the need for immediate 
changes in higher education to bring about 
diversity. She rebuked the common argument 
that kindergarten is the place to start. On the 
contrary, Smith proposed that the greatest need 
exists for graduate schooling. 

"If graduate education is not engaged, we 
will go very short distances; Smith said. 

Smith also spoke about placing value on the 
multiple identities of individuals and on steer-
ing clear of classifying individuals solely on the 
basis of color. 

Smith closed her discussion rhetorica lly,

The play, written by William

lowed by an open discussion for 
the audience.

Record Number Went Abroad Last Year 
The UCSD International Center recently 

released its annual report, ranking UCSD third in 
the country in number of students sent abroad. 
A record 756 students went abroad through 
either the University of California's Education 
Abroad Program or UCSD's Opportunities Abroad 
Program. 

In the last 15 years, part icipat ion in the pro-
grams has increased by 764 percent. 

In hosting international students, UCSD ranks 
fourth, behind Harvard University, UC Berkeley and 
UCLA . UCSD hosted 1.612 international students 
during the 1999-2000 school year. 

The study also stated that UCSD students 
studying abroad and international students 
studying at UCSD received a total of $481,534 
in scholarships. 

Physicist, Anthropologist 
Named Research Lecturers 

Lu Jeu Sham, a professor of physics, and 
Melford E. Spiro, a professor emeritus of anthro-
pology, have been selected as the 1999·2000 
Faculty Research Lecture Award Recipients at 
UCSD. 

Sham will present a lecture, "Dancing with 
Elec trons (and to Herd Schroedinger Cats?)" at 
4 p.m. April 9 in the Garren Auditorium in the 
Basic Sc iences Building of the UCSD School of 
Medicine. Spiro will lecture on "Utopia and its 
Discontents· at 4 p.m. on May 14 in the Basic 
Sciences Building 's Liebow Auditorium. 

Sham's theoretical research in the area of 
condensed matter physics is credited with an 
enormous impact in physics as we ll as in mate-
rials science, chemistry and electrical engineer-
ing, He is most renowned for his work on the 
density of functional theory, which he developed 
with UCSD professor Walter Kohn. The Kohn-
Sham theory has played a major role in solid 
state physics, quantum chemistry, surface 
physics and chemistry and nuclear physics. 

Spiro founded the department of anthropology 
at UCSD, which has since risen to the eighth-
ranked such department in the nation. Throughout 

his career, Spiro's reigning interest has been in the 
field of culture and personality. His other areas of 
study have been religion and supernatural belief, 
cultural theory and human nature. 

A.S. looking for Band to Open 
this Year's Sun God 

A.S. Festivals is looking for a UCSD musical 
group to play first at this year 's Sun God 
Fest ival. The deadline for submissions has been 
extended until Friday, AprII 6. 

The committee asks that interested bands 
submit their CD or tape to the A.S. offices, locat-
ed on the third floor of the Price Center. The 
band's contact information must be on the sub-
mitted CD or tape to be considered. 

The top five bands will be selected to part ic-
ipate in a Battle of the Bands, to be held April 
13. The winner of the musical competition will 
perform in the opening slot of the Sun God con-
cert. For more information call (858) 534-4451. 

UCSD Researchers Expose 
Bare Facts on Skin 

In a study conducted recently, UCSD 
researchers discovered a protein that is crucial 
for the creation of the top layer of the skin . This 
is the part of the epidermis that protects the 
body and prevents dehydration. 

The find ings were published in the April 5 
issue of the journal Nature. 

Mic hael Karin , who led the research in his 
lab, and his team used mice to identify the pro-
tein, which is called a keratinocyte differentia-
tion-inducing factor and is instrumental in the 
establishment of the cells that make up the out· 
ermost layer of the sk in. 

These findings may lead to increased under-
standing of wounds and also to new methods of 
healing them. 

. The study was supported by grants from the 
Nat ional Institutes of Health, the Associat ion for 
International Cancer research and the CERIES 
Research Award to Karin.

Diversity: 
Speakers ca11ed for a repeal of

ContInued from ..... 1 
asking "If not now, when?" 

Smith's words were followed by short 
speeche from each of the panelists from the 
council on diversity. The panelists addressed 
issues of admissions and outreach and dis-
cussed already functioning programs to 
counteract the trend of the increasingly 
homogenous campus. 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph Watson remarked on the continuing 
need to press toward the goal of cul tural 
diversity. 

"I don't think UCSD has found all the 
solutions to cultural diversity," he said. 

Watson also alluded to recent talk of 
eliminating of the SATs as a criterion for 
admission to the university. 

Peace Corps:

campuses in top 25 
~from""'l 

Kim noted that Ugreat motivation, leader-
.ship and a strong desire to make a differ-
ence" are common qualities that UCSD stu-
dents entering the programs share. 

The University of Wisconsin at Madison 
leads the country in sending alumni into the 
Peace Corps, with 93 graduates currently 
volunteering. 

Second in the country is the University 
of Colorado at Boulder with 74. 

UC Berkeley is the only other UC school 
in the top 25. It ranks third, with 70 alumni 
currently volunteerin~. 

"The strong sho",!mg of colleges from so 
many different parts of the country illus-
trates that many students today are solidly 
liedicated to service and deeply value the 
unique experience the Peace Corps offers; 
Baquet said.

Laura Barroclough, an ethnic studies 
graduate, spoke on the weakness of the SAT, 

"The SAT is culturally biased toward 
students with greater amounts of money; 
Barroclough said. 

Smith concurred, remarking that recent 
studies have shown that high SAT scores do 
not equal success in later life. 

Following the speeches from Smith and 
the panel members, there was a question-
ana-answer period . The aud ience was 
allowed to address questions to the panel 
and to Dynes. 

One group called for a repeal of SP-1 
and SP-2 and gave Dynes a petition to sign 
that would call for such a repeal. 

SP-l and SP-2 were legislative docu-
ments passed by the UC Regents in 
response to the passing of Proposition 209. 
SP-1 and SP-2 state the university 'S policy 
on affirmative action, which is aligned with 
the dictates of Proposition 209.

number of various community-building 
activities such as fighting hunger, develop-
ing clean water rod teaching local chil-
dren. 

As these countries become more 
advanced, volunteers provide computer 
support and even help to create small busi-
nesses. 

Because of the diverse nature of projects, 
students of all majors volunteer for the pro-
gram. The Peace Corps needs volunteers 
with skills from engineering to economics 
to natural sciences. 

Currently, there are over 7,000 
Americans working overseas to help 
improve communities in 137 countries 
around the world. 

The traditional notion of the Peace 
Corps serving remote areas of the Third 
World is changing. 

According to Kim, central Asia and the 
former Soviet Union have an increasing 
need for volunteers.

Shuttle Service 
Could Save Lives 

The possibility of going to Tijuana on 
Wednesday and Saturday nights has always 
been alluring for many UCSD students crav-
ing a night of dancing and entertainment that 
is not easily attainable at this campus. 

However what is synonymous with a 
night in Mexico is drinking. Typically, one 
designated driver will stay sober while the 
rest of the group consumes alcohol. 

However, in many cases, the designated 
driver for the evening ends up drinking. 
Rather than leaving the car at the border, the 
person drives it back home while under the 
influence of alcohol, thereby endangering the 
lives of everyone in the car. 

Although many believe that if UCSD 
provided shuttle service to the border pro-
motes underage drinking, the extra safety 
that it would provide is far more beneficial 
than any other negative side effect. 

It is true that with this new shuttle, only 
one more person per car could drink without 
having to fear drunken driving. With shuttles 
to and from the border, fewer students' lives 
would be threatened by drunk driving. 

To minimize these problems, the 
Guardian feels that the A.S. Council should 
work to offer a charter service to the border 
on Wednesday and Saturday nights. The 
transportation could be provided on large 
charter buses rented from an outside com-
pany from roughly 9 p.m. until 2 a.m. on 
each of these two nights. 

Though similar to Triton Taxi, this pro-
gram would not allow students to call at 
their own convenience to get a ride back 
from Mexico. 

This would obviously make the cost pro-
hibitive. However, if there could be distinct 
pick-up times when students would have to 
meet for their rides, the costs could be kept 
lower. 

We understand that this program would 
cost money, but corporate sponsors, such as 
the Mexican clubs themselves, could pay for 
their names to be placed on all advertise-
ments for the program, perhaps on the 
buses themselves. 

The buses would increase clubs' busi-
ness and therefore they would have a vested 
interest in participating. And if they chose 
not to sponsor these buses, there are many 
companies in San Diego that would be will-
ing to donate to this cause in exchange for 
some positive publicity. 

However, even if other outside sponsors 
could not be found, students would almost 
certainly pay the $S cost per person to fund 
the bus if necessary, as doing so would cur-
tail the problem of drinking and driving and 
having to fi nd rides to Mexico. 

In a school criticized for a lack of social 
activities, providing this service for the stu-
dents would make things better to a small 
degree, not to menti on safer.

A.S. elections. Maybe you're brilliant and 
can actually tell the difference between 
the Unity and the One slates. Or maybe 
you're in some typically collegiate state of 
inbetween confusion. 

In that case, this artide is for you. 
What fo llows is a tip-of-the-iceberg 
examination of some of our departing 
A.S. officers. 

Last quarter I gave you the 1,000-
\/lord lowdown on soon-to-be ex-Presi-
dent Doc Khaleghi. Since I only have 
about 250 words each for the vice presi-
dent external, the commissioner of com-
munications, the commissioner of stu-
dent advocacy and the commissioner of 
services and. enterprises, I'm gonna go a 
lot easier on them. Sorry, Doc. Try to take 
it in stride. What follows is both a guide 
for how these folks did and a lesson in 
how to think about the new folks trying 
to get their jobs. 

Vice President External Eugene Mah-
moud graded himself down for his work 
with fellow A.S. Council members. Mah-
moud gave himself an unfairly low 0-, 
thereby demonstrating exactly the kind 
of self-criticism and humility that marks 
a good official. 

The sad truth is that good candidates, 
with their flashy smiles and "ain't I 
great" credentials, rarely have what it 
takes to do the job they so easily get. 
Mahmoud actually did look like a good 
candidate, despite being a last-minute 
entry when his good friend was disqual-
ified, and he turned out to be a great 
official. 

The vice president external is charged 
to do exactly the kind of macro-advocacy 
that A.S. President Doc Khaleghi 
exce lled at. Mahmoud focused on his 
own strengths, including an immense 
reserve of respect and affinity for tradi-
tionally marginalized groups. He set out 
to make his office a place of safety and 
accessibility in the labyrinthine third 
floor. He has accomplished this mar-

Dear Littles and GerYr!inates, 
Maybe you're blind and

collegiate state of inbetween 
confusion. In that case, this 
article is for you. 
velously. . 

Mahmoud has also had his share of 
striking accomplishments. He ran the 
best Students of Color Conference in 

. years, with a record attendance and 
television cov~rage . He contributed to 
the 3.500 voters registered on campus 
for last November's elections. His 
office, as he astutely pointed out. gives 
the A.S. Council credibility b.:yond 
simple funds distribution and student 
advocacy. 

Mahmoud graded himself as a B-
average, taking credit for getting more 
people involved with the A.S. Council 
but noting his poor balance of time and 
energy with regards to his schoolwork. 
But his office has a history of borderline 
academic probation, and in context of 

this year's council, he deserves an easy A. 
The grade earned by Rami 

Shaarawy, our commissipner of com-
mt,WicatiQ{ls. Was not 0 easy to deter-
mitt!!. ' LiK'C .many of ' i .p decessors, 
Sh' arawy was drafted atmo'st off the 
street to fill a slate and came into the job 
after a vote of no confidence in the 
Guardian, and with little grasp of the 
position's responsibilities. For overcom-
ing these challenges to the point that he 
(and we) can take his job seriously, 
Shaarawy gets an A for effort. 

For his actual fulfillment of the job, he 
does not deserve so high a grade. The 
commissioner of communications over-
sees alternative media publications such 
as The Kcala, The Muir Quarterly, and Voz 
Franteriza, to name the few that have 
actually published an issue or three in a 
noticeable way this year. Shaarawy 
approved a slew of new publications, few 
of which have actually gone to the press-
es. 

Shaarawy holds a job that has been 
wai ting a long time for a brilliant and 
effective leader to transform it. It is still 
waiting. Shaarawy gets a B+ for outs.trip-
piog his own potential , and a C for living 
up to the job. Call it a B-, and let's move 
on. 

Of course, if a professor did that kind 
of fuzzy math with your grades, it would-
n't fly. If you got into a fight over it, you 
might have to fly over to Commissioner 
of judicial Affairs Amy- Kuo. Mostly 
working behind closed doors, Kuo is 
hard to grade without having found a 
client of hers who wanted to breach con-
fidentiality . 

We'll let her represent herself. 
"I deserve an A-/B+ grade," she said. 

"I would have liked to have accom-
plished more, and I would have loved to 
make my office even more widely 
known ." 

·Seeing that I am a freshman to A.S., 
I think I did a pretty darn good job," she 
said. "Between getting acquainted with 
the system and understanding my posi-
tion without the aid of the previous stu-
dent advocate, I learned the ropes on

Slackers are Under-Rated and Disre-
spected in a World of Over-Achievers 

Random 
Ravings 

DIVYA RUNCHAL 

I have always been an aver-age student. Sure, once in a while I get an A minus or 
two, but mostly I settle for B's 
and C's at a university in which a 
B can sentence a prospective 
medical student to a certain 

• death. 
Nothing motivates me. I have 

no Oprah or Montel to push me 
to that next level. Even the fact 
that my parents pay a staggering 
amount of money to send me 
here fails to send shivers down 
my spine. 

Yet, this spring quaner, I have 
resolved to take important steps 
to' get my life under control. I will 
show you, dear reader (yes Mom, 
that means you) , that I can 
become the next A.S. Council 
president, the next editor in chief 
of the Guardian or the next chan-
cellor of UCSD. 

Of course, I'll have to kidnap 
and brainwash a couple of peo-
ple to do it, but nonetheless, I 
will become a leader, a bona-fide 
psuedo jesse jackson, albeit 
without any of his scandals, I 
hope. 

I realize that my plan may fail 
horrendously because, if I want 
to earn an award from Chancel-
lor Dynes, I have one major 
obstacle: I have to work . 

Not onJy do I have to go to 

office hours and try to under-
stand a professor's obscure 
explanation of the theory of life, 
but I also have to spend hours 
cooped up in dimly lit rooms 
with my face pressed up against 
my books, my eyes bleeding 
endlessly as I scan a steady 
stream of boring text. 

Unfortunately for me, spend-
ing hours on the telephone while 
I write e-mails to my friends and 
simultaneously paint my toenails 
does not constitute work 

Now, many of you 
struggling to balance 
work and school may 
not think that what I 
do merits a Nobel 
Prize ... you may 
complain that I'm a 
pretentious brat who 
should leave UCSD. 
(although it does by my defini-
tion). 

Even worse is the fact that I 
have been lectured, chastised, 
yelled at, begged and screamed at 
to get my life- together. • 

Everyone from my neighbor 
up the street to my brother (who, 
mind you, should take my Side 
instead of that of my parents) 
never fail to mention that I am 
wasting my time and my life by 
doing nothing. 

Yet I feel that I am doing 

something. I'm taking upper-
division classes, and while I 
miss a few classes (last quarter I 
missed six lectures for one 
class) I'm still learning even if I 
am struggling to understand 
why I signed up for such a 
ridiculous class in the first 
place. 

And do not forget that I 
write thought-provoking 
co lumns that invoke wide-
spread critical acclaim; by the 
way my mom is my personal 
publicity manager, so please 
contact her if you'd like me to 
offer a life management course, 
for the low price of $25 ,000. 

More importantly, I am a 
good soul. to put it humbly. 

I never fail to flash my dim-
ples, offer a hearty laugh in 
response to a really bad joke or 
smile at even the grumpiest 
people (even if I have licorice 
and other appealing foods stuck 
between my teeth) . 

And perhaps most important-
ly, I'm a martyr. 

Oh, sure, I may not be of the 
same caliber as joan of Are, but I 
put myself through hell, waxing 
my hairy body constantly, so that 
I will not blind innocent UCSD 
students sitting next to me in 
class. And if that 's not hard 
work, I honestly don 't know 
what is. . 

Now, many of you struggling 
to balance work and school at 
the same time, may not think 
that what I do merits a Nobel 
Prize. In fact. you may complain

Society Must Combat 
Vicious Hate Crimes 
A witness to a brutal crime demands justice 
Iy PARISA lAHAR IAN 
Staff Writer 

Every day, someone, 'some-
where, is targeted because of a dif-
ference of skin color, race, religion, 
sexual orientation, national origin 
or ethnicity. 

This hostility or violence direct-
ed against minorities is termed 
under our law as a hate crime, for 
these crimes are committed with 
the weapon of hate. 

Hate fuels the cruel words, 
smashing fists, battering head 
bashes, savage kicks and explod-
ing bullets. Hate hurts, maims and 
kills. 

This rapidly spreading epi-
demic of hate crimes is continu-
ing unchecked . 

Half a dozen hate crimes are 
reported every day in California, 
according to the Civil Rights Com-
mission on Hate Crimes. The 
Commission believes the number 
would be far higher if every inci-
dent were reported. 

That makes at least 42 hate 
crimes a week, at least 180 hate 
crimes every month and at least 
2,160 hate crimes every year that 
occur in California. 

These crimes of hate can take 
the form of vandalism, arson, 
assault and even murder. 

Look around - read the news-
paper. I guarantee you will find that 
a hate crime has occurred in your 
neighborhood, for no one is 
exempt from attack. 

And hate crimes can occur 
anywhere, as I discovered Friday 
night when I witnessed a brutal, 
racially provoked hate crime at 
the mall in my hometown of Con-

cord, Calif. 
At about 8 p.m., my grand-

mother, two younger sisters and I 
were trying to get out of the Sears 
parking lot when our car became 
boxed in by a tow truck, giving us 
front-row seats to the savage beat-
ing of an African American tow 
truck driver. 

Two white Nazi-looking thugs 
stopped the tow truck driver as he 
was walking over to move his 
truck so they could pass. The two 
thugs said, · You're not moving 
fast enough, N-word ," as they 
started pummeling his body with 
their fists. 

The tow truck driver tried fight-
ing back at first, but he was no 
match for those fine-tuned killing 
machines, who then threw him to 
the ground and took turns slam-
ming his head on the cement street 
and kicking him in the stomach 
and groin. 

Horrified, I could only think 
about getting out there to stop the 
beating. 

In a panicked frenzy I tried 
repeatedly to open the passenger 
door, not realizing until after quite 
a few unsuccessful attempts that 
the child safety locks would not let 
me out. 

I shouted formy sister, who was 
driving, to unlock the doors. But 
still I couldn't open the door, and I 
realized too late that I was sitting 
on the side with a crushed door -
I couldn't get out. 

Completely helpless to stop the 
attack on the tow truck driver, I 
watched horrified as the two white 
thugs continued to batter away at

Hate: 
S~ciety m~ recognis~ . 
cnmes agatnst mznontzes 
continued from ..... 5 
the curled-up tow truck driver, 
their intense and deliberate move-
ments transfixing me. So much 
hate. So much pain for the poor 
man. 

We did not have a phone to 
call the police. We sat there in 
the car watching the life being 
beaten out of this completely 
innocent man. Frustration 
mounted. We had to do some-
thing. 

So we honked the horn con-
tinuously as we moved the car 
forward, for we were going to 
force those two thugs to stop even 
if we had to run them over. 

It worked. With very deliberiue 
motions, the two thugs got off the 
tow truck driver and moved with 
precise steps to their two-door, 
green Ford truck. 

I do not know how the tow 
truck driver is now, but even 
after being so severely beaten he 
could barely walk, he still man -
aged to get out his tools and 
attempt to help the lady with the 
car trouble. 

I will never forget that tow 
truck man's courage and strength 
for not allowing those thugs to 
make him their victim. He fought 
back the only way he could, and 
that was to fight the pain . He 
would not allow his attackers to 
claim his dignity. 

The question that plagued me 
after witnessing this horrific 
attack was: How was it possible to 
hate so much that it could drive 
someone to beat a complete 
stranger to within an inch of his 
life? 

And the only answer that I 
came up with, is that I don't have 
the answer. 

Witnessing that brutal beat-
ing was a harsh wake-up call, 
making me realize what a real 
and dangerous threat hate is to 
us all. 

Hate does not bring our com-
munity together; ins tead, it 
destroys us, one bond of trust at 
a time. 

According to the 1997 statis-
tics provided by the FBI, 8,049 
hate crimes were reported by var-
ious police agencies ,'('ross the 
country. 

Even without taking into 
account the substantial number 

I will never forget that 
tow truck man's courage 
and strength for not 
allowing those thugs to 
make him their victim ... 
He would not allow his 
attackers to claim his 
dignity. 
of hate crimes that are never 
reported, the sheer strength of 
the reported statistics alone is 
evidence enough that hate con-
tinues to thrive and poison our 
society. 

Yet pure numbers cannot tell 
the story of the terror of being 
made a victim of a hate crime. The 
actual terror and pain caused by 
the beatings, vandalism, stalking, 
murders and racial slurs are 
things that cannot accurately be 
measured. 

Hate crimes are not confined 
neatly to urban cities or neighbor-
hoods; the FB I has identified 
schools and college campuses as 
the th ird most common place for 
hate crimes to occur. 

According to the Student 
Office for Human Relations, a 
hate!bias prevention and educa-

The UCSD Guardian 

tion program at UCSD, there were 
seven hate incidents reported for 
the year of 2000. 

The SOHR reported that less 
than a year ago on Oct. 12, 2000, 
graffiti was written on the men's 
bathroom, which read, ~Fuck all 
gooks. Asians get off our white 
campus." 

According to the SOHR, five 
hate incidents occurred on our 
campus in 1999. The SOHR 
reports in 1999 that on Feb.8, 
feces was smeared on the door of 
the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & 
Transgender Association. 

So it is clear that even our 
campus is not immune from the 
insidious disease of hate that is 
rampantly spreading throughout 
our society. 

But how do we as a society 
combat hate? 

I offer this solution: We as a 
society must declare a war on 
hate. We must be diligent to speak 
up and speak out when witness-
ing a hate crime or when we hear 
racial epithets. 

We can no longer remain 
silent, for silence is what hate 
feeds upon. 

If we don't make the offend-
ers fear any repercussions for 
their actions, hate will continue 
to spread and lead to further 
hate crimes. 

.And remember, if hate can 
hurt, maim and kill, so too does 
our silent lack of action. 

Thus if hate is the weapon of 
choice for racists, so then our 
weapon of choice in the war 
agains t hate must be the spoken 
word. 

Thus I am sending out a call 
to my fellow students: We need 
solidarity in order to break down 
the walls of hate that divide and 
hurt one another. 

United we will triumph over 
hate, divided we will fail. 

So who will speak up against 
hate? Any volunteers?

this A with a good sense of when 
to spend his time advocating a 
group and when to stay out of the 
way. 

You will be under a lot of pres-

Some of you will stay away 
from the polls because of those 
things, and some will just vote

who was talking to that girl two 
tables over. 
. If you have any self-respect, 
get yourself out of both these cat-
egories. Meet the Candidates and 
listen to what they have to say 
about their potential jobs, Are 
they informed hard workers, or 
slate-filling slackers? Ask them 
what they think about the people 
to whom I've just introduced you. 

And if they try to charm you, 
kick 'em in the shins. 

(someone once told me I was a 
~waste of space"). 

And even worse, no one under-
stands you. I've told numerous 
people that there's no point in 
working anyway, because most of 
us will end up as slaves working fqr 
evil corporations. Those people 
looked at me as though I were 
crazy. 

That's what I get for tell ing the 
truth: societ<ll isqlation. 

Anyway, I'm hoping I'll sti ll 
manage to graduate in the next 10 
years. I want to go down in histo-

Maybe then I'll finally get my

identified Tuesday as Wang Wei, 
reportedly parachuted out before 
his jet crashed, but Chinese res-
cuers have been unable to find 
him and he is presumed dead. 

Tuesday night, a government 
spokesman, asked when the 24 
Americans might be freed, 

Budget: 
White House is keeping 
mum about plan 
CotItInued from ..... 1 
million in 2000. 

President Bill Clinton champi-
oned the programs - notably the 
community access program - as a 
way to help communities link up 
doctors, hospitals and clinics car-
ing for people without health 
insurance. 

Clinton persuaded Congress 
last year to expand the programs 
so they could provide more com-
prehensive care, and the effort was 
praised by witnesses at a Senate 
hearing just two weeks ago. -

But a White House spokesman 
said Tuesday: ~We intend to phase 
out the community access pro-
gram. Creating new federal grants 
is not the best way to address 
health care access. It's an efficacy 

stopped just short of setting an 
absolute condition for their 
release. The spokesman, Zhu 
Bangzao of the Foreign Ministry, 
said "the answer to your ques-
tion" lay in China's insistence on 
an apology and an explanation. 

~[t was the U.S. side that 
caused this incident, and China is 
the victim: Zhu said at an 
unusual late-night press confer-
ence, held just before an 
American officer in Hainan met 
with the crew for the first time 
since the accident. ~The United 
States should take full responsi-
bility, make an apology to the 
Chinese government and people, 
and give us an explanation of its 
actions." 

But American officials, 
angered by the delayed access to 
the crew, appeared in no mood 
for apologies, raising the possibil-

issue." 
So far the White House has not 

disclosed many details of Bush's 
budget, which would cut taxes by 
$1 .6 trillion over the next 10 years. 

But Tuesday's disclosure pro-
vides the second example of sig-
nificant cuts in domestic pro-
grams. Earlier, administration offi-
cials acknowledged that the bud-
get would include cuts in some 
programs for children and chil-
dren's hospitals. 

Overall, officials said, the bud-
get of the Department of Health 
and Human Services will rise by 5 
percent next year, to $55.5 billion. 
But all of the net increase goes to 
the National Institutes of Health, 
for support of biomedical 
research, not for the direct care of 
patients. 

Bush's budget request, to be 
unvei led next Monday, would also 
cut federal spending for the train-
ing of doctors, dentists, nurses, 
pha:macists and other health pro-

ity of a prolonged dispute. 
Speaking on American television 
Tuesday morning, the U.S. 
ambassador, former Adm. Joseph 
w. Prueher, said the American 
government would ~have a prob-
lem" with apologizing. 

American officials have sug-
gested that a miscue by the 
speedier jet, traveling too close for 
safety, must have caused the colli-
sion, and they maintain that 
China has no legal right to board 
the aircraft or hold the airmen. 

Once American officials have 
debriefed the crew, more details 
should emerge of what happened. 
But in the meantime, American 
and Chinese officials are clearly 
worried about the damage to rela-
tions from this episode.

The New York Times 

Budget documents show that 
the money for such training would 
be reduced to $259 million next 
year, from $353 million this year. 

But White House officials said 
that since the documents were 
prepared just a few weeks ago, 
they had decided to make even 
deeper cuts. The president, they 
said, will seek $140 million for 

. training health professionals, a 
reduction of 60 percent from this 
year's level. 

A White House official said, 
~one of our overall goals is to slow 
the rate of growth of federal 
spending." Health programs, like 
many domestic programs, received 
large increases last December 
because Congress and the Clinton 
administration showed little 
restraint on spending, the official 
said.

Good Relations Between

Continue to Deteriorate 

RAMALLAH , West Bank - ~ I f 
Arafat is a terrorist, then what is

Mohammed Dahlan, the Gaza secu-
rity chief, asked Tuesday, one of sev-
eral mordant rhetorical questions 
that peppered his bleak prognosis 
for the near future. 

insists on a cease-fire before diplo-
macy resumes, starting with a public 
denunciation of violence by Vasser 
Arafat. 

Dahlan scoffs at such demands. 
" 0 one can fully control the reac-
tions of a mass of people who are 
angry," he said. 

Palestinian officials say that the 
Israelis should go first, and pull back 
their troops and tanks, open borders 
and checkpoints, cease their assassi-
nations. 

They say that they will not unilat-

"This is a very. very resistance against

Dahlan said that Palestinians -
surrounded by Israeli troops and 
tanks, angered by economic and 
human losses, and possessing little 
hope that a full peace settlement was 
now possible - were prepared for a 
long period of sacri-
fice. 

"As far as the

After a day like 
Tuesday, when a morta r bomb 
wounded an Israeli baby in Gaza and 
the [sraelis retaliated with shelling 
that wounded about 30 people, the 
two sides agree on only this: The 
conflict is likely to worsen before it 
improves. 

In the last two weeks, Israel has 
withstood a spate of terror bombings 
inside its borders and shooting 
attacks on soldiers and settlers in the 
West Bank and Gaza . The 
Palestinians have endured a block-
ade by Israeli troops, the shell ing of 
neighborhoods that serve as bases 
for gunmen, and the assassination, 
abduction and arrest of terror sus-
pects, most of whom are security 
officials. 

With the backing of many 
Israelis, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon

Dahlan ."Unfortunately, it allied to 
nothing." 

It is a stalemate. Officials on both 
sides publicly maintain that there are 
no contacts at all between Israelis 
and Palestinians right now, and in 
the absence of talk, there is the lan-
guage of violence and the dialogue 
of vengeance. 

In one of many signs of the dete-
riorated relationship between the 
two sides, Dahlan has been prevent-
ed from returning to Gaza by Israeli 
security officials. 

"As I speak now, I realize that 
Israel can assassinate me as I leave 
th is building," he said. "But this will 
not solve the larger problem."

Diversity: 
Dynes says outreach is more 
important than SP -1 repeal 
ContInued from page 3 

Dynes said that he was opposed to the 
legislation, as he was opposed to the passing 
of Proposition 209. However, he said that 
repealing SP·1 and SP·2 would not change 
the law that stands under Proposition 209 in 
California. Dynes also remarked that the 
present outreach programs are more impor-
tant than the repeal of SP-1 and SP·2. 

"I do not want to.put to compromise the 
outreach programs for the sake of a repeal to 
SP-1 and SP-2," Dynes said. " I will not sign 
this because 1 don't sign these sort of things. 
That does not mean 1 will not fight the 
regents aggressively against SP-1 and SP-2: 

Students found this response unsatisfac-
t<?ry. Alexis Montevirgen, a biology major, 
expressed worry. 

"My biggest concern was the reasons the 
chancellor gave for not signing the petition," 

Bang Bang: 
Post-performance discussion forum 
drew audience participation 

performed it, hoping the message of the play 
would be conveyed to at-risk students. 

Matthew Weatherman played Josh, the 
youth who turns in desperation to violence. 
Josh, like Kinkel, turns the gun on his par-
ents, as well as five classmates. 

The play featured performances by 
Phillip Botello, Adriana Campos, Daisy 
Cross, Markus Erdmann, Alison Hoover, 
Annika Keller, Annalyn Lehnig, Jenny 
McArthur, Alma Schneider, Geoffrey Sykes 
and Weatherman. The actors are all students 
at CoSA. 

Dr_ Vivian Reznik of the Academic 
Center of Excellence on Youth Violence 
Prevention was responsible for bringing the 
play to UCSD. 

At the end of the play, much of the audi-
ence was in tears_ 

The post-performance forum opened an 
intimate discussion between the cast and 
audience on issues of violence. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Montevirgen said. "I don't see it as a choice 
between outreach programs we have now 
and the repeal of SP-1 and SP-2. The repeal 
should not affect the programs we have." 

Other audience questions involved the 
status of diversity at UCSD and the means 
for getting to where the university needs to 
be. 

Undergraduate student Joseph Sherman-
Villafane rebutted a claim Smith made in 
her speech regarding the widespread partic-
ipation among students fighting for diversi-
ty. 

Smith said that the trend seen at most 
universities is that students of color are 
active in seeking diversity. Sherman-
Villafa ne claimed that the students fighting 
for diversity are often the underrepresented 
themselves.

Overall, the meeting expressed optimism 
for the Preuss School and for programs 
such as C.R.E.A.T.E _, while demonstrating a 
need to press on for a larger amount of

with typical earthquake and fire drills, high

Chocolat 

"Chocolatn blends reality and fantasy in a 
depiction of a French town seemingly 
devoid of passion. This begins to change as 
single mother Vianne Quliette Binoche) 
comes in with her daughter (and the wind) 
and proceeds to open up a chocolate shop at 
the same time Lent begins. 

The conflict arises when Comte de Rey-
naud (Alfred Molina) recognizes ·the pres-
ence of temptation in Vianne and her 
chocolates (which have various magical 
attributes) . Soon a battle ensues between 
the purity of willpower and the sinful plea-
sure of giving in. 

The film features strong performances 
all around, though special mention should 
be given to those who take their characters 
up a notch . 

For example, Judi Dench was excellent 
playing Armande, the landlady renting out 
to Viannc. 

She's enjoyable in that gruff, live-while-
you-can way reminiscent of "Grumpy Old 
Men." Also, Molina's personal struggle with 
temptation as the pious Comte de Reynaud 
is as real as it can get. He fights against 
desire for the town but it's clear from the 
beginning that he's fighting for himself as 
well. . 

The narrative style and presence of fan-
tasy give the story a fable-like edge. The 
issues Chocolat contends with are ancient. 
It 's the solution proposed that is unique. 

There's a reason this film was nominated 
for Best Picture - see it. 

- Eric Dean 

Enemy at the Gates 

"Enemy at the Gates" does well in pre-
senting a picture of a war-tom time but strug-
gles with details of individual characters. 

The setting is Stalingrad, 1942. The 
Russian army is depleted and fa lling fast to 
the Nazis. It lacks h.ope and a hero. That 
hero becomes Vasili Qude Law), a humble 
sniper. Evehtually. he is opposed by his Nazi 
counterpart, Konig (Ed Harris) . The winner 
of their snipe-off will tum the tide of the 
war. In addition, there is a love triangle 
involving Vasili, Danilov Ooseph Fiennes) 
arid Tania (Rachel Weisz), a triangle of which 
DanilO\l gets less than 60 degrees: Tania 
does not love him as he loves her. 

The movie loses. points for wasting Har-
ris' talents - Darth Maul had more lines. It 
also fails to play up the love triangle. Fiennes 
has the most intriguing character, yet he 
never gets to confront Vasili and Tania at the 
same time. I got tired of the eyeball shots, 
and the originality of sniping lost its flair 
after an hour. I actually found myself wanti-
ng to see more love stuff and less sniping. 
That's where the best acting was . • 

Director lea -J cques Annaud's empty-
colored vision of crumbling StaHngrad, sev-
eral intense war scenes and the suspense 
between sharpshooters were all plusses. 
Also, Vasi li and Tania's sex scene occurred 
in a unique and provocative way - based on 
its location. The Russians were the good 
guys for once, too. 

This picture just might be worth a shot. 
Pun intended.

Whatever Happened to the 
Hollywood Classics? 
The Guardian remembers what good acting, masterful 
directing and well-written scripts use to be like 
By ANNE CONGAtUYEN 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

The majority of movies released 
today seem to have a sole purpose: 
to sell tickets. And what types of 
movies sell tickets? The movies full 
of gratuitous violence, nudity, sex 
and special effects. 

Every once in a while, however, 
one might be lucky enough to 
stumble upon movies worthy of 
praise, but even these movies do 
not get the proper recognition they 
deserve. A good number of note-
worthy films are produced by small 
companies or are independent 
films and are not well-publicized 
nor widely viewed. Instead, the 
films ,hat are produced by large 
companies, with big-name celebri-
ties, are the most popular, whether 
the actors can act. 

It makes me wonder about what 
happened to films that were actual-
ly good - the great black and 
white movies that had recognizable 
plots and talented actors. With vast 
technological resources and a large 
pool of willing actors available, one 
would think that the film industry 
would be able to eroduce better 
films, yet it still can t, . 

The lack of good films, with the

Promotor battles with 
city for rights 
Continued from page 10 
was opposed. That minority had 
the connections to law enforce-
ment agencies through local 
deputies, whom they were agitat-
ing. Nevertheless, Green continued 
to complete the required permits 
and move forward with the plan-
ning and booking of the event. 

AUGUST 1997 

About a month before the con-
cert, there was so much hostility 
from a group of about 10 families 
that Green volunteered to go to a 
town meeting in Shelter Valley 
where the party was to take place. 

On Aug. 6, 1997 he attended the 
meeting, which was the largest in 
the history of Shelter Valley. 
Green's aim was "to address the 
issues and concerns of the citi-
zens." The meeting was quickly 
turned into what he describes as a 
"witch hunt." 

He recalls the attitudes of the 
townspeople as "Who the fuck are 
you coming out to our town, 
bringing a rock concert, a punk 
concert, an acid-rock concert?" He 
found that ·the event was being 
labeled everything but what it was. 
The residents tried to point out 
that Green could not control the 
"undesirable people" and that he 
could not keep the patrons within 
the camping site. 

Green continued to petition the 
County of San Diego and the sher-
iffs department, reminding them 
that the majority of people wanted 
the event to continue as planned. 
However, there were a few who 
could not be satisfied. 

Despite the opposition, Green 
had done everything to ensure a 
safe and legal event for the patrons 
and the community members alike. 
During that time, Render contin-
ued to refer to the event as a rave. 

"Coming up to the date of the 
event, [ continued to receive infor-
mation that the event was still being 
referred to' as a rave: Green said. "So 

exception of those that somehow 
manage successfully to incorporate 
technology, good acting and a well-
written script, can cause one to 
overlook the films of Alfred Hitch-
cock or Leo McCarey. 

In our society today, many peo-
ple lack the capability to recognize 
- let alone appreciate - classic 
films because of the overwhelming 
presence of films that are visually 
dazzling yet completely bereft of 
any real content. It is sad that 
some people only know of Alfred 
Hitchcock for "The Birds" or "Psy_ 
cho" and believe that he only made 
horror movies, or that some pe9-
pie do not even know who 
Humphery Bogart or Gregory Peck 
are. 

The '50s were a landmark time 
in Hollywood history as an interval 
between present-day technological 
Hollywood and the historic silent 
film era. It was during this time that 
many talented actors and actresses, 
writers and directors were able to 
use their talents to utilize the avail-
able technology to produce 
remarkably touching, exciting or 
long-lasting classics. 

Films such as Tennesee 
Williams' "A Streetcar . NamM 
Desire" or "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' 

finally I called the deputy at home, 
but it was to the point that I thought 
it was going to damage the event. I 
didn't want people thinking it was a 
rave, and also it put law enforcement 
in a position that meant I would be 
doing something illegally." 

Green tried to plead his case 
rationally. 

"Look, what you're doing to me 
is wrong; Green said. "You cannot 
label my event a rave, because it's 
not a rave. Doing so will cost me 
money and damage tile event's 
attendance." 

Green recalls Rinder response: 
"Well, Mr. Green, that's my feeling, 
and regardless of what you tell me, 
I think that this event is a rave. But 
if you can jump through all the 
hurdles, and that's IF you can, then 
you can have your party." 

As things proceeded, the 
motions of legality were upheld. 

"A couple weeks before the 
event I was introduced to Sgt. Ken 
Prue, incident commander over the 
whole event, meaning that he was 
going to supervise all the deputies, 
the patrolling and the responses to 
the event; Green said. "I was told J 
by Prue, who treated me as a pro-
fessional, that [law enforcement 
officials[ cannot and would not 
come onto the site. Furthermore, 
that if I needed any assistance from 
the Sheriffs Department, that I 
need to call a certain number." 

Green saw this as a turnaround 
in the process of getting the festival 
put on. 

"I felt that was great; he said. "I 
felt really good about everything, 
and despite Rinder, I thought I was 
developing a relationship with the 
sheriff's aepartment that would 
ensure no interference with the 
event, and that would be helpful in 
the future." 

Green went on to discus safety 
plans for the event. 

"I informed Prue that I was 
bringing in Elite Security from 
Qualcomm Stadium and that I 
would have 40-plus guards on duty 
during the concert. As anendance 
grew, we would bring more securi-
ty members onto the site to ensure 
the safety of all." 

The response from Prue indi-
cated that this was fine. He reiterat-
ed that law enforcement could not ' 

showcased popular actors such as 
Paul ewman, Marlon Brando and 
Elizabeth Taylor in roles that were 
complex and in films that were dis-
turbing yet remarkable. 

In contrast , there are the 
perennial feel-good classics such 
as "Roman Holiday" or "An Affair 
to Remember," starring the ever-
popular Audrey Hepburn and 
Cary Grant. Alfred Hitchcock was 
a genius at combining romance, 
suspense and mystery in films 
such as "Spellbound" and "Suspi-
cion." 

In order to preserve these film 
classics, people must watch them. 
Many of these classic films are 
being lost annually because so few 
care about these films that efforts 
to preserve them are diminishing. 
There are only a few organizations 
that participate in preserving clas-
sic films, and they will not continue 
to do so unless the public actively 
shows that they want these films to 
be preserved. 

So show these organizations 
that we don't want these films to 
disappear by renting classits like 
"To Rave and Have Not" or "Say_ 
onara," or call the cable company 
and demand Turner Classic 
Movies. 

and would not go to the event site; 
that Green and Elite Security 
would be the eyes and ears of the 
sheriffs department. 

This greatly pleased Green, as 
he says, "because if I display a safe 
event, and did everything by the 
books, then the next go-around of 
getting permits wouldn't be such a 
difficult task." 

DAY 1 of the campln' Tr'p 
Festlva' 
Satu ..... y, Sept. 20, 1997: 

The gates officially opened at 
noon, but some people, between 
200 and 300, had been waiting 
since the night before. People had 
driven long distances. Green heard 
of people coming from "as far as 
Salt Lake City, Utah, to enjoy the 
festival," which was uplifting news 
for Green. "It looked really good. 
There was a great response from 
the people waiting in line," he said. 

Noon to 4 p.m.: 

There were more than 150 cars 
arriving every hour, with an average 
of three to four patrons per vehicle. 
Most had ca mping gear, and Green 
noted their demeanor as "very pos-
itive, very ex ited about the event. 
The music was going, we had three 
stages - it was a really nice day. 
Everything, for me as a promoter, 
was just coming together seamless-
Iy, and that feeling was incredible." 

Smooth operation was especial-
ly important when there were so 
many elements and issues on the 
line, including multiple bands over 
two days, vendors and performers. 

After 4 p.m.: 

It was around 4 p.m. that a per-
son came to Green, highly agitated 
and ranled . He informed Green 
that at the last turn onto the la t 
road (Stage Coach Road), sheriffs 
deputies and border patrol agents 
had set up a roadblock and check-
point. 

This was set up as a search for 
illegal immigrants, but the exit off 
Stage Coach Road heads south, not

Green: 
City officials lie to stop 
party in Julian 
ContInued frOID ..... 13 
north, going against the reasoning 
for that excuse. People were being 
pulled out of their cars without 
their consent, patted down, their 
belongings removed and searched 
and drug dogs were being taken 
into the cars. 

The officials were turning peo-
ple away, saying the event was can-
celed, or sold out, or that tickets 
were $50 and parking $25. The 
rumors and lies were endless. 

So many people had respect for 
law enforcement, as did Green at 
that time, that they believed what 
they were told, turned around and 
went home. From the time that 
Green was informed of the situa-
tion, attendance was directly affect-
ed. After 4 p.m., attendance went 
from 150-plus vehicles every hour 
to a dismal 20 to 30. Green realized 
that "with headliner acts going on 
at 9, 10, and 11, if this traffic flow 
continues, then I'm a bust finan-
cially. "t's- over!" 

"Not surprisingly, he said, "it 
never got better at all." 

Some did continue to pass 
through, but the flow stayed at about 
five to seven cars every 15 minutes. 

"Those that did make it through 
and were able to perceive enough 
to get to our gate came into contact 
with law enforcement at the check 
point, went through the experience 
and .continued on, only beca use 
they did not believe what they were 
told by law enforcement; Green 

_ said. "Mostly, this is because they 
had some kind of personal connec-
tion With the event and did not 
hear that it was canceled, so they 
wanted to see for themselves." 

Others made it through the 
checkpoint because law enforce-
ment was so busy with vehicle 
searches that the cars were able to 
slip through without notice. More 
interesting is that there were those, 
like Green's father, whom Green said 
"looked conservative enough, as a 
white male in a Jeep Grand Chero-
kee, that he was allowed to go 
through without any sort of search." 

"Ninety percent of the people at 
that check point were subjected to 
illegal searches," Green estimated. 

While all this was happening at 
the checkpoint, deputies started to 
enter the facility on dirt bikes, con-
trary to what they had said would 
happen. Then they entered and 
occupied the event site for 14 con-
secutive hours. They raced around 
the park, kicking up dirt and break-
ing the 5 mph speed limit. Rather 
than driving in any sort of safe 
manner, they maintained speeds of 
20 to 30 mph throughout the park 
and around people. 

In what Green believes were 
attempts to intimidate, deputies were 
staring down patrons, coming into 
contact with people and upsetting 
everyone. As people later testified in 
court, they were made to feel very 
uncomfortable and always had to 
watch out for the reckless deputies. 

Prue and several other deputies 
came into the site with Ford Broncos 
and patrol cars, all of this without 
the necessary consent of Green, 
which was directly the opposite of 
what he had been told by officials. 

Green was left to ask himself, 
"What is going on?" 

"I am being betrayed for what I 
had done, and the efforts I have put 
into this event," Green answered. 
"What I was told by the sheriff's 
department was not the truth , and 
they had some kind of goal. some 
kind of plan to destroy the event by 
way of their 'checkpoint: and by 
way of their harassment." 

Green tried to continue with the 
event, but while people were per-
forming. the sheriff's helicopter did 
multiple fly-overs "at what I estimate 
to be an altitude of about 300 to 400 
feet, which is extremely low." 

At this height, debris and dust 
were kicked up constantly into the 
CfQ"Iq and onto the stage. Green 

began to get reports from the 
bands about feedback in monitors 
and of being completely drowned 
out by the helicopter. 

The extreme noise and its prob-
lems helped to push Green over 
the edge. "I just threw up my hands 
and realized that this was a disas-
ter; he said. "There was nothing I 
can do but try and continue my 
responsibilities as a promoter." 

The strong-arm tactics began to 
weigh more heavily on the event 
and on Green as people began to 
take their frustrations out on him. 

The endless question of 
"Why?" was .central: "Why can'l 
you do something about the check 
point?" 

"Why can't you do something 
about the deputies?" 

"Why can't you do something 
about the helicopter?· 

"Why are we being treated this 
way by law enforcement?" 

With $15,000 worth of bands to 
perform on Sunday, not a single 
deputy or border patrol agent was 
in sight. 

"The damage had been done; 
Green said. "They knew that Satur-
day night was the big push for 
attendance." 

And then on Sunday it was all 
over - no checkpoint, no one in 

The UCSD Guardian 

the event site, nothing. 

Zp.m.: 

Time to pay the talent and the 
service providers, which brings a 
menacing realization to Green. He 
is over $80,000 in debt because the 
event's attendance was so low. 

"I didn't get anywhere near the 
attendance I needed; Green said. "I 
needed 3,200 people to attend, but I 
had about 800 paid attendees." 

Green said that the border 
patrol testified that "approximately 
250 cars came through the check 
point every hour," which easily 
would have supplied Green more 
than the necessary attendance for a 
successful event. 

The Aftermath: 

In trying to figure out what legal 
action he could take against the San 
Diego Sheriffs Department, Green 
attempted to obtain an attorney. It 
took several attempts before Green 
found Mike Marrinan, who was 
actually willing to put forth the effort 
needed and would not be intimidat-
ed by the authorities. 

It would be three years before the 
case went before a judge. Then, after 
a mere three-week trial, with two 
days of deliberation, the jury would 
return a unanimous verdict: The 
San Diego Sheriffs Department and 

the County of San Diego, with 
named sheriff's deputies. primarily 
Prue, were found guilty of violating 
Green's First and Fourth Amend-
ment rights, along with state claims, 
including negligent interference 
with prospected economic advan-
tage, and awarded the full $1.5 mil-
lion, as requested by Marrinan. 

The verdict was a decisive emo-
tional victory for Green. "It was 
incredible to know that what they 
did was wrong; he said. 

The power of the verdict was also 
in the fact that the case was such a 
credibility contest between Green 
and San Diego law enforcement. 

"That's what it boiled down to," 
Green said. "Who did they believe? I 
mean, they put up 15 deputies, and 
the jury didn't believe any of them." 
Now: 

Post-trial motions were heard 
on March 26. Unsurprisingly. the 
County of San Diego has not 
admitted its guilt. The county is 
requesting a new trial and reduc-
tions in the verdict. 

The countly also claims there 
was an error in allowing hearsay, 
and that cumulative damages were 
overlapping, so there should be 
only one award. Green and Marri-
nan have filed countermotions. 

Now the judge is doing further 
research on the issue and should 

HIATUS IS 

return his findings in the next few 
days. If all of the county's motions 
are denied and the verdict is 
upheld, the county can try to settle 
with Green or take the case to the 
Ninth Circuit Appeals Court. 

If the county's motions are 
granted, Green has to face the 
financially and emotionally daunt-
ing task of taking the case to the 
next level of appeals, or trying to 
settle out of court. 

The Disagreement: 

Kevin Kennedy, a spokesman for 
the county and senior deputy coun-
ty counsel member, told the Unwn-
Tribune that "The San Diego Sher-
iffs Department handled itself pro-
fessionally and appropriately .... The 
deputies did nothing wrong and 
they dispute that any illegal searches 
were conducted." 

Green feels that "the county will 
most likely have [its] motions 
denied and the verdict upheld, 
which means they will come back 
and offer me most of the money to 
see if I'm willing to finish." 

Unsure of what his response 
will be, Green considers the possi-
bility of spending two more years 
in the Court of Appeals, where any-
thing can happen.

Promoter fights brutality

ContInued from ..... 11 

"That's a gamble; he said. "You 
don't want them to come back in 
favor of the county, or possibly 
award a new trial, which would 
mean finding all the people who 
previously testified and trying to 
get them to speak out again . Those 
people want to get on with their 
l ives, and so do I." 

The prospect of ending the 
ordeal hangs heavily as Green con-
siders whether he will take the 
money the County will inevitably 
offer. 

"The San Diego Sheriffs 
Deputies were willing to pacify the 
few angry voices of Shelter Valley," 
he said. "They knew that if' the 

event was a success with the mini-
mum estimated 5,000 to 10,000 
people, as stated in my permit, I 
would hold subsequent events at 
Stage Coach Trails, and they 
absolutely did not want that." 

Now, after the trial, Green won-
ders "why the county won't honor 
a jury's decision, and why they 
continue to waste taxpayers' 
money to fight a fight that I feel is 
done and over." 

The jury foreman was a county 
employee, someone who would be 
concerned about the effect that his 
ruling might have on his job. How-
ever, the verdict still speaks of the 
level of misconduct that took 
place. 

One has to keep in mind that 
Green was fully within the bound-
aries of the law. In fact, he shoulc\

the concert as it took place. When 
the people who are supposed to be 
enforcing laws can move outside 
the system, we suffer. 

Though thankfully there were 
no losses of life because of the 
actions of law enforcement, the 
implication here is that those with 
power feel that they can do any-
thing they want. This verdict, if 
upheld, could send a clear message 
to San Diego's law enforcement 
that this is not a police sClle. To put 
this case in perspective, it is the 
largest verdict in the history of San 
Diego for Police Misconduct. 

Green's willingness to fight 
back against the brutality of police 
misconduct, -and his refusal to be 
intimidated by government scare 
tactics, is a lesson for all of us. We 
must be ever vigilant for threats to

our rights. 
As Green said, "The fight is for 

everybody in the county; my strug-
gle is that of every promoter in the 
nation." T he point is that injustice 
will hann us if we do not stand up 
against it. 

"I have a right, as validated by the 
verdict," Green said, "that a concert 
promoter has a right to reach his 
intended audience, who have the 
right to attend his facility without 
government interference, which the 
check point was. My freedom of 
speech is in part, the bands that I 
book to perfonn, not just the words 
that I say. A promoter may have rea-
sons for having a hip-hop act, or a 
reggae act, because it is a reflection 
of who they are." 

As proven now in federal CO:.lrt, 
police in terference with a music 
concert just because they don't like 
it or its attendees is illegal. 

To Green, the ordeal sent the

message "So what? You have your 
permits, we'll destroy you anyway." 
His adherence to legality is what 
has saved him after the fact. 

"If I hadn't had the permits, I 
would have won nothing; Green 
said. . 

Ironically, Green thinks that he 
"probably would have had a much 
better event if I had done it illegal-
ly, promoting and holding it under-
ground style; which begs the 
question: What kind of actions are 
being encouraged? The legal and 
safe ones, or the underground and 
unregulated ones? 

My final question t6 Green was 
this: Would he hold a similar event 
now that he is supported by the 
rulings? 

" I don't know," Green said. "I put 
my career on the line every time I 
have an event, and from the experi-
ences with the police, I'm not sure 
that it wouldn't happen again." '

A Pair of Swimmers 
Makes Big Splashes 
Lopez, Watanabe sh i ne at 
national champ ionships 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 

first because it's a different meet 
and anything could happen," 
Lopez said. "' knew I'd be facing 
some tough competition ." 

UCSD swimming head coach 
Scott McGihon had other ideas. 

The UCSD Guardian Thursday, April S, 2001 

Crew: 
Team from Chicago no 
match for the Tritons 
continued from .,..e 20 
record for the· 2,000-meter on the 
ergometer, a machine that rowing 
teams use to chart their times with-
out having to be in an actual boat, 
with a time of 7:20:05 

Going into the CAA Division 
II Swimming and Diving Champi-
onships on March 14 to March 17 
in Canton, Ohio, neither sopho-
more Jennifer Watanabe nor junior 
Sandra Lopez had much trepida-
tion about going head to head 
against the other top Division II 
swimmers from around the nation. 

"I expected them to swim fast." 
he said . UI didn't plan on anybody 
winning a championship." 

Courtesy UCSO Athletics 

Tops: Jennifer Watanabe (left) and Sandra Lopez are unstoppable forces in the pool. 

This leaves Hopkins in the top 
three overall in Triton history in the 
2,OOO-meter. Sophomore Emily 
Grey is just 0 .4 seconds away from 
the overall lightweight record at 
UCSD. This shows the upcoming 
talent that may carry the team in 
the future. 

"I was [nervous] a little bit." 
Lopez said. "But I think the sup-
pon of my team helped me calm 
my nerves." 

Neither had many expectations 
for the championships. 

"I didn't really have expecta-
tions: Watanabe said. "I just want-
ed to go out and have fun." 

Clear minds helped them in the 
competition. 

"Going into the meet, I tried to 
not think about me being ranked 

Watanabe had other ideas. On 
the first day of competition, she set 
a school record in the 200-yard 
individual medley with a time of 
2:04.41 . Her first-place finish 
added to the four national tides 
she won last year. 

On day two, Watanabe came 
back to win the 400-yard individ-
ual medley with a time of 4:22.68, 
which is also a school record.

"Every individual title is like a

wouldn't be there if they didn't have 
their teammates to push them." 

With both these top-notch 
swimmers returning next year, and 
a third overall finish in this year's 
NCAA Division II championships, 
next year's swim team is poised to 
make some big waves. 

The next event for Triton crew 
is the S~n Diego Crew Classic. The 
ninth-ranked lightweight eight 
team from UCSD will go against 
the No. 1, No.3 and No.5 boats in 
this tournament. The Tritons look 
to prove that they are one of the 
elite teams in the San Diego area. 

"Last year in this tournament 
the lightweight team did well, and 
we expect most of our crew teams 
to advance to the finals this year." 
Pinkerton said. "Even though 20 
top crew teams are competing, we 
expect the varsity eight squad to 
compete in the final."

According to Padres General

Henderson's sales pitch was as 
stellar as his trademark headfirst 
Iide. He called down to the front

are preparing for the future, a. 
future that includes a shiny new 
stadium, filled to the brim with 
thousands upon thousands of 
screaming, adoring fans. 

- Speaking of said stadium, 
where the heck is it? I remember 

I, for one, was for the new

anymore, unless it's one of those

sends it to you and then if you 
send it to a bunch of other people

saw the check.) 

Anyway, the new ballpark was 
supposed to be San Diego's crown 
jewel, a gleaming monument 
where the Swinging Friars would 
achieve championship after cham-
pionship and bring boundless 
glory to our city by the sea. But as 
of now the "stadium" is little more 
than a hulking, stinking pit in the 
ground, inhabited only by city rats 
the size of hamburgers. 

I asked a nearby hobo about 
the project's progress; he 
motioned me closer and told me

While this comment was of lit-

made. The whole ballpark fiasco 
has been rife with crooked con-
glomerations and shady, under-
handed dealings. 

Sordid characters of many 
stripes were involved, includ.ing a 
man near and dear to UCSD stu-
dents - no, not Lupe, the dearly 
loved burrito concocter from 
Taco Motion, but Robert Dynes. 
Yes, that Robert Dynes, our chan-
cellor and the supposed emoodi-
ment of everything good and 
moral. 

While the smoke has not yet 
cleared and investigations are still 
ongoing, it appears that those 
huge tuition checks we cut each 
quarter are jllst not enough to sate 
Senor Dynes' voracious thirst for 
wealth. 

I hope the situation will rectify 
itself in time, but until then one 
must look to Lupe for guidance in 
the way of the right.

Women's Water Polo Loses Two, Wins Two 
Tritons lose to Loyola and Davis, but top Pacific and Redlan.ds 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Associate Sports Editor 

While you were lounging poolside late last 
week with a drink in your hand, the Triton 
water polo tea m was hard at work, engaging in 
a quartet of fiercely contested matches against 
some top California teams. 

The Tritons first took to the cozy confines 
of Canyonview Pool last Thursday, squaring 
off against the University of the Pacifi c. 

The hard-fought match saw a late surge by 
the Tigers almost usurp UCSD's quest for vic-
tory. 

The Tritons carried a 2-1 lead into the third 
quarter, during which they piled on two more 
goals to establ ish a 4-1 lead. 

The Tigers came roaring back in the 
fourth. scoring th ree goa ls and threatening to 
score more. The Tritons managed to score 
another goal and with that goal cinched the 
victory. 

Emma Kudritzki was outstanding in the 
pool against the Tigers, scoring a game-high 
four goals and leading the team down the 
game's home stretch. Hilary Smith chipped in 
a goal as well. 

Goaltender Megan Hubbs also turned in a 
stellar performance, recording nine saves and 
stolidly defending the cage in the crucial fourth 
quarter.

quished by Aggie senior Kim Parker's golden 
goal with 2:35 left. 

The Tritons then showed they were a team 
of grit and determination by coming back to 
double up on the University of Redlands, 8-4, 
in their final game to close out the tournament 
on a high note. 

The Tritons will face Pomona Pitzer. College 
at 5 p.m. Saturday at Canyonview Pool. 

The enthusiasm garnered from the tight 
victory soon subsided as the Tritons felt the 
pain of the sharp claws of the Loyola Mary-
mount Tigers, dropping two of their three 
games in the LMU Invitational. 

The Tritons opened the tournament with an 
excruciating overtime loss to the host team. 4-
2. Their second match pitted them against the 
Aggies of UC Davis in a match that tested the 
will of all. 

The Davis game was a true team effort for 
the Tritons, as six players got in on the scoring 
action. Silverman led the team with a pair of 
goals, while Bourret, Danielle Boyle, Courtney 
Hemmerly, Smith and Kudritzki had one each. 
The Redlands match saw more of the same 
unilateral effort from UCSD. 

While the Tritons' record now stands at a 
less than sterling mark, the statistics belie the 
progress the team has made. Coach Larry 
Sanders and his charges have been making 
strides in the water all season long and look to 
make an impact in their upcoming games. 

The Tritons will be put to the test as they 
will face off against some of California's pre-
mier programs as the season winds down and 
the postseason approaches~They will definitely 
use this weekend 's match with Pomona-Pitzer 
as an opportunity to crank their game up a 
notch in anticipation of the season's final 
stretch.

Tritons were the first to blink and were van-

C~ew Attends San Diego Championships 
. Women can't hang with fellow Men's varsity eight team loses 
San Diego univerSities for the first time in four years 
By ARViND YUAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCS D women's crew partici-
pated in the annual San Diego 
City Championships on Saturday. 
The competi tion featu red the 
three top teams in the San Diego 
region: San Diego State Universi-
ty, the University of San Diego 
and UCSD. 

In the women's novice eight 
race, SDSU took top honors with 
a time of 7:36.00. USD came in 
second with a time of 7:45.70, 
while the Triton A team came in 
third with a time of 8:01 .50. 

"Honestly, the results are what 
we expected." said Patti Pinker-
ton, the second-year head coach 
fo r the UCSD women's crew 
team. "The big boats were too 
experienced for our team. USD 
and SDSU showed their maturity 
in the eight match, but on the 
bright side. we did improve from 
last year. We showed a good deal 
of growth. which is a great sign 
for tHe future: 

In the women's novice four 
rllgatta, the Tritons kept up with 
the SDSU team for most of the 
race. However, the Aztecs showed 
their ability to close out races 
down the stretch to finish a li ttle 
over thirty seconds ahead of 
UCSD. 

"Our novice four team was 
quite competitive," Pinke:rton 
said. "We experienced some 
equipment problems in the race, 
but our girls fought until the end. 
SDSU has an incredible team, 
but I can see the groWth in our 
gi rls. Since last year, we have 
closed the distance from the top 
teams, so hopefully, in the 
upcoming years, we can overtake 
them: 

The women's varsity eight 
race was again a race between 
SDSU and USD. SDSU finished 
with a burst of speed to defeat its 
crosstown rivals with a time of 
6:57.80. The USD Toreros fin-
ished a close three seconds 
behind with a fi nal time of 
7:00.50. UCSD finished with a 
time of 7:27.20. . 

The true strength . of the 
SDSU team was seen in the 
women's varsity four race. The 
two Aztec rowing teams took firs t 
and second place, leaving USD 
and UCSD to battle for third. The 
SDSU A team took the top spot 
with a time of 7:55.50. UCSD 
came in 15 seconds behind USD 
with a time of 8:24.30 to finish 
fourth.

UCSD men's crew competed 
in the San Diego City Champi-
onships on Saturday at Mission 
Bay. 

The event ran from 7 a.m. to 
10:30 a.m. and was a combined 
regatta of UCSD, San Diego State 
University and the University of 
San Diego. 

In the varsity eight race, which 
was the premiere event, VCSD 
varsity crew lost for the first time 
in four years. 

"I'm disappointed about los-
ing the race but I also feel that the 
crew is faster than they raced this 
weekend," said UCSD men 's 
crew head coach Michael Filip-
pone. "The City Championships 
were a primer for the [San Diego] 
Crew Classic. I don't consider the 
results to be indicative of how 
things will end up at the end of 
the year: 

Despite the loss in the pre-
miere event, the varsity four: boat 
put in the best performance of 
the day in the men's varsity four 
race. 

"They showed very good 
speed and beat two good boats 
from SDSU and USD. That was 
by far the better performance of 
the men's varsity eight: Filip-

pone said. 
Also turning in a solid perfor-

mance was the men 's novice 
eight, which rowed to a tie with 
the Toreros of USD. 

The lightweight and junior 
varsity eight squads have been 
moving fast and had some good 
races for the Triton men's rowing 
team as well. 

Filippone continues to be 
optimistic about the outlook of 
the rest of the season. 

"I feel confident and remain 
confident that [the varsity eight] 
will go fast," he' said. "Right now 
our main goal for varsity is to 
make it to the finals at the Crew 
Classic and to see if we can place 
in the top thltt. -At the novice 
level, we have the Newport regat-
ta coming up: 

This weekend's San Diego 
• Crew Classic at Mission Bay is 

one of the premiere rowing 
races in the nation and draws 
3,000 to 4,000 competitors each 
year. 

In addition, thousands of row-
ing enthusiasts who wi ll be 
appearing as spectators are 
expected to be in attendance. 

Fil ippone anticipates a great 
event that will be attended by 
many parents, fellow Tritons, 
boat-loving spectators and 
UCSD alumni.
