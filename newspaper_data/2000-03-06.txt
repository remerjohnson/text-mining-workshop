WILMINGTON, Ohio - After 
the most tumultuous week of his 
campaign, Sen. John McCain is 
still clinging to the hope that 
Tuesday's critical set of primaries 
will give him some rationale to 
keep his insurgency alive. 

For months, as the Arizona 
senator rose from being a small 
blip on the political radar to a 
national phenomenon, McCain 
had declared that the nomination 
battle would be decided on 
Tuesday, when 13 states, includ-

Michael Stirs Protest, Debate 
RELIGION: Namesake of Campus Crn ade for ehri t campatgn speaks out 
Staff Writer 

Michael Carley, a Warren 
senior, gave a personal testimo-
ny regarding his faith in 
Christianity Friday at noon in 
the Price Center. Carley is the 
student at the center of the '" 
agree with Michael" weeklong 
campaign. 

The campaign is sponsored 
by Campus Crusade for Christ 
in cooperation with several 
Christian student-run organiza-
tions. Supporters say that its 
aim is to spread the Christian 
message of living a life accord-
ing to the Word in order to be 
saved. 

Campaign participants have 
worn blue '" agree with 
Michael" shirts and have 

m~nned tables throughout 
campus to support their cause, 
which has stirred disagreement 
among students 

Carley told several hundred 
students how he challenged his 
faith when he reached UCSD. 

"I challenged it intellectual-
ly, spiritually, emotionally and 
scientifically," he said. '" want-
ed to know the truth. , present-
ed my challenges to God by 
studying the Bible and examin-
ing other religions." 

Michael told the students 
that he and fellow Christians 
wearing the blue shirts believe 
in only one God, and the only 
way to know God is through 
Jesus. 

'" want you all to know the 
one true God," Carley said. 

While Carley was speaking, 

many students holding signs 
reading. '" do not agree with 
Michael, no, no," peacefully 
protested the event. Some 
turned their backs while Carley 
spoke. 

Muir junior Jen Levine said 
she has her own beliefs and she 
doesn't agree with the Michael 
campaign because it imposes its 
beliefs on others. 

" I believe in respect for all 
and their personal beliefs," she 
said, "but their campaign 
makes me uncomfortable. I 
don' t have to live like that." 

Marshall sophomore David 
Weisberg, a parliamentarian 
officer of the Union of Jewish 
Students said his organization

Price of 
Cigarettes 
May Rise 
COST: Admini tration 
believe General Store 
should not ell tobacco 
By MAn SCHRADER 
Staff Writer 

Students who buy cigarettes at 
the General Store in the Student 
Center may soon be paying high-
er prices as a result of an agree-
ment b tween the A.S. Council 
and the administration . 

Vice Chancellor of tudent 
Affairs Joseph Watson and A.S. 
President Tesh Khullar met on 
Feb. 25 to discuss the po ibility 
of banning the sale of cigarette at 
the General tore. 

The issue spurred much debate 
between Watson and members of 
the General Store, who feel that 
the decision should be placed in 
the hands of the students whom 
this legislation will affect. 

"People who come to college 
are adults," store manager 
George Gonzales said . "This 
choice should be theirs." 

Regardless of the General 
Store staff's belief, Watson main-
tains that the selling of cigarettes 
on campus does not promote the 
image of health UCSD is attempt-
ing to present. 

"We are trying to encourage a 
nonsmoking environment here 
on campus," he said . " I don't 
believe that the university should 
be making a business of profiting 
from these sales either." 

Watson beJieves that the health 
risks involved with smoking ciga-
rettes should far outweigh the 
benefits, ease and price of buying 
them at the General Store. 

"I understand the convenience

served. Keg identification num-
bers will also be issued.

ELECnON: Members of the Gore and Bradley campaigns discussed education, drug use and immigration 

Staff Writer 

Representatives from the 
presidential campaigns of AI 
Gore and Bill Bradley came to 
UCSD Thursday night to answer 
students' questions about the 
candidates and their campaigns. 

The forum, sponsored by the 
newly refom;led UCSD College 
Democrats, gave students an 
opportunity to ask questions 
directly pertaining to them as 
young student voters. 

"We basically felt that we 
wanted to bring political aware-
ness and consciousness to the 
UC$O community,'" ~id 

Michelle Davies, vice president 
of the UCSD College Democrats. 
"There is a large population of 
students here, and if they were 
politically active, , think it could 
make a real difference. Hosting 
events like this really brings pe0-
ple's attention to the topics.' 

Morley Wmterguard, a senior 
policy advisor. for the Gore cam-

.paign and Jim Bates, a former 
congressman and Bradley sup-
porter, fielded questions dealing 
with affirmative action, the legar-
ization of drugs and immigra-
tion. 

Winterguard said Gore sup-
ported affirmative action and 
al!lO d~,&OlT!e of the pro-

grams Gore devised that would 
heir. all students attend college. 

'The first is the establishment 
of someth'ing we call a 401J 
which essentially provides for a 
family to save tax-free for their 
child's college education from an 
early age, if they are fortunate 
enough to have that money 
available," he said. . 

Bates said that affirmative 
action was not an adequate 
enough solution to the problems 
facing youth. 

"Of course Senator Bradley 
supports affirmative action, but I 
think his emphasis on education 
as a lifelong process is dealing 
with it in the very beginning," he 

said. "For example, many black 
students are graduating from 
high school who can't read or 
write .... You're not going to get 
into college under affirmative 
action if you are that far behind." 

When asked about the rele-
vance of candidates' personal 
drug use and the legalization of 
drugs, Winterguard expressed 
doubt that it would become an 
important issue, because he said 
it is a known fact Vice President 
Gore used drugs while serving in 
the Vietnam War. 

He then affirmed Gore's anti-
drug stance.

CIGARETTES: 
Watson says policy 
encourages smoking 
ContInued from ..-e 1 
of buying on campus," he said. 
" But this is a product that is 
unhealthy even when used as 
directed." 

In an effort to discourage 
smoking here on campus, the uni-
versity and Khullar drafted an ini-
tial compromise on Friday, Feb. 25. 

This compromise stated that 
the price of cigarettes at the store 
would increase to prices compa-
rable to those outside the univer-
sity, and that the profits made 
would go toward the funding of 
smoking cessation projects. 

Watson said he believes that the 
25-cent savings in price from buy-
ing cigarettes on campus increased 
students' urge to smoke. . 

"It is an absolute mistake to 
sell on campus because in a 
sense, we are encouraging stu-
dents to smoke," he said. "My 
view is that they should sell at a 
comparable rate to the outside to 
make it so that we are not assist-
ing the smokers." 

However, Gonzales maintains 
that any increase in price or the 
overall banning of selling ciga-
rettes only stands to hurt the stu-
dents who will smoke regardless 
of these new policies. 

"Cutting out supply won't 
decrease demand and increasing 
the price will only make the 
smokers have less money," he 
said. "Already smokers have to 
pay 50 cents in taxes per pack." 

Despite the controversy sur-

rounding this issue and the new 
compromise, Watson said he 
would agree to what is currently 
being proposed. 

"This is not an ideal compro-
mise, because I still trunk no sell-
ing of cigarett~ is a better 
approach," Watson said. "But I 
felt it was a good compromise, 
and I am willing to e~dorse it." 

Members of the General Store 
said they believe that any com-
promise would be an infringe-
ment of their rig~ts and would be 
unfair, since they are the only 
group affected by this particular 
student health issue. 

"Drinking soda is bad for your 
teeth, drinking alcohol is bad for 
your kidneys and eating bad 
food is bad for the body, but we 
don't see the university saying 
anything about that," said Joe 
Casillas, an employee of the 
General Store. "They are only 
talking about smoking. It seems 
very narrow-minded for them to 
focus on this one cause of student 
health. It is unfa'ir that ther are 
focusing on just one aspect: 

In addition, Gonzales said the 
General Store will not approve 
any resolution until they can give 
their input and are allowed to 
help write the compromise. 

Watson said the administra-
tion will let the A.S. Council 
decide on this situation on their 
own, as it is not part of universi- . 
ty policy to deal with issues con-
cerning the General Store. 

"This is an A .S. (Council) and 
student store decision," Watson 
said. "11 is just not part of (the 
administration's) structure."

National Marrow Donor Program, which has contact· 
ed several agencies in an attempt to find a possible 
donor who can save Avendano 's life, Avendano, 28, 
is an employee of the U.S. Postal Service and the 
father of three young children. A bone marrow match 
could save his life.

mark for women In developing countrtes to assess 
how far they have come in their struggle for equality, 
peace and development. 

Estela B. de Carlotto will speak Wednesday

Rights." During Argentina's "dirty war" In the 1970s, 
some 9,000 people were abducted by military forces 
or 'disappeared" r- including young children and preg. 
nant women. As president of Grandmothers of the 
Plaza de Mayo in Argentina, Carlotto led the crusade

"Drinking is equal if not worse 

than cigarettes," Gonzales said, 
"but obviously Vice Chancellor 
Watson doesn't agree with us." 

Watson said fie believes that 
drinking on campus is not under 
scrutiny as he feels it is not an 
unhealthy act. 

"There is no indication that the 
consumption of alcohol is harmful 
as cigarettes are in this case," he 
said. " In fact, some argue that a lit-

At Gore Bill Bradley 
By MELANIE HOLFELD 
Staff Writer 

Al Gore, as the nation's most practi-
cal and proven leader, is the best 
Democratic candidate for the next pres-
idential term. As congressman, senator 
and vice president, Gore has demon-
strated not only his political savvy to 
compromise and achieve the best out-
comes for America, but also his moral 
integrity to fight for individual rights 
in issues like abortion, welfare and 
affirmative action. Gore's policies 
regarding the economy and technology 
are key to both the resolution of prob-
lems facing Americans today, and to 
the promise of a better future. 

Gore has a long history of public 
service that testifies to the ieadership 
qualities of a politician primed for the 
presidency. First, Gore's fiscal policy 
is sound. In 1993, his vote in the 
Senate passed the economic plan that 
has brought about the strong econo-
my America enjoys today, bringing 
with it low unemployment, over 18 
million new jobs and a budget sur-
plus. Gore's policies encourage 
investment. American voters prefer 
his tax plan over every other candi-
date's - his policy would provide for 
tax cuts to resuscitate Social Security 
and to bolster Medicare. As vice pres-

ident, Gore combated chronic govern-
ment overspending through the 
Reinventing Government initiative, 
which helped reduce the bureaucracy 
by 350,000 workers and streamlined 
inefficient internal government poli-
cies. 

The bull economy has not, however, 
blinded Gore to the underprivileged 
and the issue of poverty in America -
Gore believes properly implemented 

. government policies can help the indi-
vidual. His reform efforts have also 
helped get seven million people off 
welfare. Gore embraces the elimina-
tion of racial profiling and the 
im~r~veme.nt of .affirmative action 
policIes. HIS presIdency promises a 
21st century civil rights act as another 
step in the continuing fight for racial 
harmony in America. In addition to 
writing the Homeless Persons Survival 
Act and the Employment Incentives 
Act with the aim of closing opportuni-
ty gaps among classes, Gore fought for 
Community Empowerment, a pro-
gram that affords special tax breaks 
and incentives to private parties who 
invest in neglected urban and rural 
communities. Gore also empowers the 

individual with his pro-choice stance 
on abortion.

The course of presidential elections, 
unfortunately, is often dictated by the 
polls. In addition to measuring pe0-
ple's current preferences in an election, 
polls also have an effect in determining 
futull! outcomes, deflecting attention 
from the issues and leadership and 
focusing them on Helectability." 

This is certainly the case with the 
Democratic race for presidalt, where 
Al Gore holds what appears to be a 
commanding lead over former Sen. Bill 
Bradley. However, shouldn't our vote 
go to the best candidate, not simply the 
one people think is most likely to win? 

No vote is ever wasted, so long as it 
is heartfelt, educated and represents a 
positive message for our country. II 
enough people believe in the same 
message and in the person touting it, 
anything can happen. A half century 
ago, nobody thought a man could ever 
walk on the moon. If that could come 
true, why can't we elect Bill Bradley as 
our next president? Let us explore the 
reasons why we should have the will to 
do so. 

Presidential elections and cam-
paigns are always more complicated 
than they have to be. Despite all the 
strategies and attacks, people usually 

end up voting on one or two factors, or 
even a mere image on TV. So I will 
make it easy for you. Here are 10 rea-
sons why you should vote for Bill 
Bradley as your next president: 
1. ~.rI •• DI 

Gore may have more political expe-
rience, but Bradley clearly tops him in 
terms of real-life encounters. Bradley 
grew up in a small town in Missouri, 
where he wasn't groomed to be a 
politician. Through hard work and 
determination, he evolved into a talent-
ed basketball player both on the colle-
giate and professional level. He was 
also a Rhodes Scholar and Olympic 
athlete. Bradley won two champi-
onships with the Knicks, not as a 
superstar, but rather as a team player 
who looked to pass before he shot. 

After elaying basketball for a 
decade, Bradley joined the Senate as its 
youngest member. He co-authored the 
1986 Tax Reform Bill, which eliminated 
many corporate loopholes and cut 
rates across the board. 

When he left the Senate, Bradley 
wasn't content to rest on his laurels. He 
authored many bestselling novels, 
became a consultant to JP Morgan, 
taught and then traveled around the 
country talking to people in anticipa-

u.s. SENATE 
D •• acrld - 1M-. ,.. ....... 

u.s. Senator Dianne Feinstein is the 
most qualified Democratic candidate 
for U.S. Senator in California's March 7 
primary election. Elected to the Senate 
in 1992, Feinstein has demonstrated 
unparalleled dedication on the subject 
of gun control, education and the envi-
ronment - all of which are crucial 
issues that affect every Californian. 

In 1994, Feinstein played a key role 
in the drafting of the Crime Bill's 
Assault Weapons Ban, which was an 
unprecedented restriction of the manu-
facture, sale and possession of military-
style assault weapons. Feinstein also 
helped author the Gun-Free Schools 
Act, which reqUired federally ,funded 
school districts to adopt zero-tolerance 
policies toward gun-toting students. In 
1998, Feinstein convinced President 
Clinton to sign an executive order to 
stop the import of S9 types of assault 
weapons; the order halted over 1.8 mil-
lion street sales of such weapons. 

Feinstein's demonstrated investment 
in education is equally impressive - in 
1995, she met with business leaders, edu-
cators arid elected officials to uphold a 
statewide commitment to educational 
reform. Feinstein introduced a measure 
to authorize $1 billion per year for a five-
year span to help reduce class size and 
achieve academic excellence; to provide a 
tax credit for public school construction 
and rehabilitation bondholders; and to 
ensure that California students receive an 
accurate and fair share of federal educa-
tion funds. 

Furthermore, Feinstein has consis-
tently acted on behalf of California's 
environment. She had a hand in the 

Desert Protection Act, the Headwaters 
Forest Agreement an.d the Quincy 
Library Group. She is now draftins leg-
islation to rid Lake Tahoe of dangerous 
pollutants and to remove the gasoline 
additive MTSE from California drink-
ing water IIOU I'Q!I. • 

Due to Feinstein's proven dedication 
to these and other California policy 
issues, the GUQrdulII endorses her as the 
best Democratic candidate for U.S. 
Senate. 

•• pllbllc:_ - '- C •• pII •• 
Six Republicans are competing for 

Dianne Feinstein's seat in the U.S. 
Senate. Of the six, the GWlrdilm feels 
that Tom Campbell is the most qualified 
Republican to represent our state. 

One of the most important issues fac-
ing college students is the affordability 
of higher education. Campbell supports 
expanding California's system of higher 
education and allocating more federal 
funds for Pell grants so that college can 
be affordable for more California stu-
dents. He also advocates shifting the 
burden of educational administration 
from the federal to the state and local 
levels. 

Campbell has supported expanded 
programs providing federal aid for 
child care and increases in the earned 
income tax credit for poor working fam-
ilies with childrer.. In addition, he sup-
ported the Family and Medical Leave 
Act, allowing parents to take a leave of 
up to four months after the birth of a 
child without fear of losing their job. 

Campbell also takes a tough stance 
on crime, proposing measures to fight 
drug use, curb juvenile crime and sensi-
ble gun control laws that sti!. protect the 
constitutional right to bear arms. 

The GUQrdian supports campbell's 
goals and urges you to vote for him as the 
Republican candidate for U.s. Senate.

HOUSE 
D •• ac ... - ...... A. .... 

Susan Davis, who is IUMing for the 
49th congressional district, has a wealth 
of experience from serving three terms in 
the California State Legislature. While 
serving the 76th Assembly District, Davis 
proved to be a tireless advocate for edu-
cation. As a member of the Education 
Committee, Davis authored legislation to 
Improve tcachet assessment, help more 
high school students meet California 
State University placement standards 
and to reduce class sizes. She has twice 
been honored as Legislator of the Year by 
the California School Boards Association. 
Without a doubt, if elected to Congress, 
Davis will continue to fight for education 
causes. She is the Democratic candidate 
most likely to help UCSD grow and 
develop in the new century. 

In addition to her strong education 
background, the GUQrdian supports Davis 
because of her extraordinary record of 
fighting for quality healthcare, the preser-
vation of social security, decreased taxes 
and consumer protection. In the 
Assembly, Davis authored a law making 
it possible for women in HMOs to sched-
ule an appointment with their OB/Gyn 
without referral by a primary care physi-
cian. Equally impressive, as a state legis-
lator, Davis led the fight to reduce out-of-
control gas prices by authoring a bill to 
affirm the power of local governments to 
regulate oil companies' sale of gasoline. 

For these reasons and more, the 
GUJlrdian is confident that Davis is the 
best Democratic candidate UCSD stu-
dents want fighting for them in the 
House of Representatives.

In the Republican race for U.S. 

Congress in San Diego's 49th district, the 
Guardia/1 endorses current Congressman 
Brian Bilbray. 

A native of Imperial Beach, Bilbray 
was first elected to Congress in 1994. 

Ouring his yearS in Congress, Bilbray 
has been a supporter of the environment 
and has fought to ban offshore oil drilling. 
He has supported measures to stop pollu-
tion in local beaches and bays, such as th 
City of San Diego's Coastal Low Flow 
Storm Diversion Program, which would 
improve water quality in coastal waters. 

Bilbray serves on several House com-
mittees, including the Commerce 
Committee, the Subcommittee on Health 
and the Environment, the Subcommittee 
on Finance and Hazardous Materials, 
and the Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigations. 

The Guardian has some problems with 
Bilbray. Specifically, he introduced legis-
lation that would prohibit children born 
in the United States to undocumented 
immigrants from automatically receiving 
U.S. citizenship. We do not agree with 
this legislation. 

At the same time, however, we believe 
that Bilbray has been an independent 
voice in Congress who has not been 
afraid to break ranks with his fellow 
Republicans. Thus the Guardia" endorses 
Bilbray as the Republican candidate for 
the House of Representatives.

George W Bush 
By DEVIN W. PHILLIPS 
Staff Writer 

The Republican presidential race 
in 2000 has turned into a highly con· 
tes ted political battle not seen in 
recent campaigns. The two main can-
dida tes debated for the last time 
before the Super Tuesday primaries 
in Los Angeles, where Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush once again emerged 
as the clea r Republican front-runner. 

Over the past year, Bu h has cam-
paigned stead ily for the Republican 
nomination, becoming the first viable 
Republican candidate to have the 
support to win both the nomination 
and the general election. Currently, 
Bush has won six primaries and cau-
cuses around the nation, giving him a 
clea r footing for the primaries to be 
held March 7 in states including 
California and ew York. 

Republicans around the country 
have given their support to the Bush 
campaign because they believe that 
only Bush has the knowledge, ability 
and the political record to serve the 
American people as president and 
end the tarnished Clinton-Gore era. 
Bush is now in his second term as 
governor of Texas, the first governor 
of that state to be elected for another 
consecutive four-year term. 

During the 1998 election, Gov. 
Bush won 68.6 percent of the vote, 
including 49 percent of the Hispanic 
vote, 27 percent of the African 
American vote, 27 . percent of 
Democrats and 65 percent of women. 
Clearly, Bush has the ability to gather 
support from many segments of the 
population in order to achieve victo-
ry. He, bases his large support on his 
principles of limited government, 
personal responsibility, strong rami-

lies and local control, which have 
earned him a reputation as a compas-
sionate conservative and a reformer 
with results. 

The theme of compassionate con-
servatism and reform has followed 
Bush throughout his political career 
in Texas. He believes strongly in 
working with people with opposing 
political views in order to get the joll 
done. Bush has been a strong 
reformer in Texas by working with 
the state legislatures and bringing 
both political parties together to 
reform the areas of education, health 
care and lowering taxes in order to 
improve the lives of all people in 
Texas. 

In the area of education, Bush 
stands by a philosophy of setting 
clear and attainable goals, testing to 
assure goals are met, accountability 
for success and failure, local control 
and competition in the classroom. 
These principles of educational 
reform have resulted in improved 
test scores in reading and math for all 
ethnic groups and have narrowed the 
gap between minority and disadvan-
taged students to their advantaged 
and nonminority peers. In fact, many 
of the reform policies adopted in 
Texas have been used to improve 
California schools. Clearly Bush leads 
the class in educational reform and 
plans to continue these policies Oil 
education as president to ensure that 
no child is left behind. 

In addition to his views on educa-
!ion, Bush believes strongly in lessen-
109 the tax burden on the American 
people, creating a strong national 

- defense, ensuring peace by improv· 
ing and strengthening our military

john McCain 
IyTOM W 
Senior Staff Writer 

Another four years have passed and 
with them, a tarnished presidential 
office and an embarrassed nation. 
Though the history books will long 
remember the impeachment and near 
removal of President Clinton, we 
Americans now have the chance to look 
beyond the past and focus our attention 
on the future. And the future is now. We 
have entered the new millennium and 
this next presidential election will allow 
us to choose a president that will lead 
this nation into the new frontier and set 
the standa rds for presidents to come. 

Of the four major candidates in this 
election, perhaps the most dynamic and 
interesting is republican. John McCain of 
Arizona. McCain's history is in and of 
itself a story fit for a Hollywood movie 
and what he has striven to achieve as a 
senator has proven his commitment for a . 
better, more dignified nation. A chairman 
of the powerful Senate Commerce 
Committee and member of the Armed 
Services Committee, the senator is well 
known and respected by members of 
both parties. 

In the circles of politics, the name 
John McCain is well known for moder-
ation, straight talk, a hot temper and 
bad jokes. Outside of Washington how-
ever, McCain is slowly, ever so slowly, 
becoming a household name. Allow 
me this opportunity to explain why I 
feel John McCain is more fit than 
George W. Bush to receive the 
Republican nomination for president 
and more generally, fit to be the chief 
executive of the United States. 

You may be asking youneJf: How 
does McCain differ from any of the other 
candidates, particularl hiS Republican 
rival, George Bush? ~OUgh the two 

Republican candidates are both consid-
ered moderate conservatives and gloss-
ing over the issues would reveal little 
differences, looking at the fundamental 
issues and ideologies separates the two. 
However, before I go into the nitty-gritty 
of McCain, the politician, let me briefly 
tell you about McCain, the war hero, a 
story ['m sure many have heard. 

While Bill Clinton was protesting 
the war, McCain (whose father and 
grandfather were admirals) was flying 
warplanes over North Vietnam. 
During a bombing raid of Hanoi, 
McCain was shot down and held cap-
tive by the Viet Congo For five long tor-
turous years, McCain was held captive 
in Hanoi Hotel, one of the most infa-
mous POW camps in Vietnam, refusing 
to give in to the threats and empty 
promises made by the Viet Congo 

He even refused to accept an early 
release when the Viet Cong discovered 
he was the son of an admiral, not want-
ing to leaYe his fellow captives. What 
does this reveal about the man's char-
acter? Honor, patriotism, loyalty and 
respect, things lacking from our gov-
ernment and particularly our current 
president. 

Ideolo!ticalIy, how does McCain dif-
fer from Bush~ The answer lies in the 
details of the issues, like abortion, glm 
control ana federal spending. Where 
Bush is more conservative, McCain is 
more moderate, appealing more to the 
masses. With the legacy of President 
Ronal.d Rea~a.n still looming over 
American politics,. both candiddtes are 
vying for the coveted mantle of the next 
heir to Reagan, 

However, where Bush appeals most-
ly to ('onservative, right-wing 
RepUblicans, McCain appeals mostly to

GORE: 
ContIMed frOlll N. 4 

While his experience in public 
office affords him a deep under-
standing . of the issues facing 
Americans, Gore also envisions a 
great future for the nation. He 
embraces technology and the 
benefits it can bring the United 
States. The information super-
highway, the Global Information 
Infrastructure and the Electronic 
Bill of Rights are all evidence of 
Gore's commitment to the future. 
The globalization of the Internet 
will create new economic oppor-
tunities as the standard of living 
is raised by improvements in 
technology that allow capital to 
be used more effectively. 

Gore's investment in techno-
logical improvements is compli-
mented by his investment in

tion of a poSSible presidential bid. 

A president who can relate to 
the people needs experience not 
only within the Washington cir-
cle, but in all facets of public life. 
In this case, the choice is clearly 
Bradley. 
2. l.eIIdenIIIp 

Leadership means standing up 
for what you believe in no matter 
what. Bradley has always said, 
"Sometimes you'll agree with me, 
sometimes you won't, but you'll 
always know where I stand, and 
I'll always tell the truth." 
Leadership is not based on polls, 
public opinion, spin doctors or 
unage consultants. It is based on 
doing things because they are the 
right things to do. Bradley champi-
oned Native American rights in 
the Senate despite the issue's 
unpopularity, and he has 

knowledge. Gore is committed to 
education, proposing a $ 115 bil-
lion plan to reduce class size, 
improve teacher quality, repair 
old schools and provide a univer-
sal preschool. E-rate discounts 
would help all schools afford 
Internet access, thus giving the 
advantages of technology back to 
the community. 

Gore goes to the root of prob-
lems in America. For example, he 
understands that illegal drug use 
is the symptom of deeper prob-
lems in society. In addition to 
increased funds ·to augment drug 
awareness and police enforce-
ment, he also addresses drug 
abuse by proposing after-school 
programs. These programs aim to 
eliminate community disconnect-
edness and give kids alternatives 
to drug abuse. 

Even though he has taken heat 
lately for his environmental 

embraced race relations and cam-
paign finance reform as the corner-
stones of his campaign, even 
though these issues barely register 
on most people's top issues lists. 
s. ........ c... 

Bradley's plan is the only one 
to offer quality, affordable care to 
all Americans. For a family of 
four making $32,000, he would 
subsidize all of their health insur-
ance. He also requires parents to 
enroll their children in health care 
plans at birth, ensuring that all 
children are covered. 

Gore's plan is .considerably 
less ambitious. He plans to 
insure all children incrementally, 
which basically means up to five 
or 10 years. Various research 
stuoies have indicated that 
Bradley's plan covers aprroXi-
mately 80 percent 0 all 
Americans, whereas Gore's cov-
ers 30 percent. The economy is 
strong and the government is 
running budget surpluses. Why 

The UCSD Guardian 

stance, Gore is also deeply com-
mitted to the environment. He 
has bei!n working intimately with 
automobile manufacturers to 
develop vehicles that are environ-
mental friendly. As vice president 
he has fought for tougher clean 
air standards and more aggres-
sive toxic waste cleanups. His 
Livability tnitiati~e 'aims to help 
cities improve the quality of life 
by preserving green spaces, alle-
viating traffic congestion and 
educating communities about 
"smart growth" strategies. 

Finally, out of all the candi-
dates, Gore has the most experi-
ence. As vice fresident he has 
already forge dose working 
relationships with leaders of 
other nations - no other candi-
date can boast the same. 

Gore's Democratic competi-
tion, Bill Bradley, favors many of 
the issues Gore supports: free 

can't we provide our citizens 
with the basic assurance of 
health care: that someone will be 
there for them if they are sick? 
4 ...... Control 

Thirteen children are slaugh-
tered at Columbine. Seven 
employees are gunned down in 
Honolulu. A seven-year-old kid 
kills his six-year-old classmate in 
Michigan. What has this country 
come to? 

Common sense tells us that we 
need the toughest gun control 
measures, while at the same time 
we need tp protect owners' rights. 
Bradley proposes such a plan. He 
is the only candidate running 
who will license and register all 
handguns and evict gun dealers 
from residential neighborhoods 
so they can' t target our kids. We 
can't afford to wait for another 

~~ 
Gore may propose " revolu-

tionary" change to our public 

trade, a woman's right to choose 
an abortion, the dismantling of 
racial profiling and health care 
reform. However, Gore has dis-
tinguished himself from Bradley 
by moving beyond mere rhetoric 
to proposing realistic legislation 
for the achievement of America's 
goals. 

Both Bradley and Gore seek 
universal health care. Bradley's 
plan, however, will deny 
Medicaid coverage to roughly 14 
million people. While it does offer 
them the chance to deduct health-
care insurance premiums from 
their income taxes, most of the 
people who don't have health 
care today don' t have premiums 
to deduct. Bradley's plan, while 
good in theory, is unrealistic. 
Medicaid is needed for AIDS 
patients whom private insurers 
will not cover. Baby boomers who 
do not enjoy employee benefits 

schools, but Bradley is the only 
candidate who wants to put a 
qualified teacher in every class-
room. He proposes scholarships 
to place 600,000 new teachers in 
classrooms by the end of the next 
decade and then implement mea-
sures to make sure they are 
accountable and well-trained. 
Education is a life-long process, 
Bradley believes, which is why he 
also favors expanding Head Start 
significantly and investing more 
in our community colleges. 
•. c..1IICn FIMnce Refonn 

Bradley has said that cam-
paign finance reform may be our 
most important issue because it is 
linked to every other issue. As 
long as money has an influ!!nce 
on politics, certain individuals 
will have a disproportionate 
voice in our democracy. Gore has 
said that he and Bradley have the 
same position on this issue. True, 
but they don' t have the same 
commitment. Bradley talks about

will not have any insurance in the 
absence of Medicare. 

Gore recognizes the necessity 
of Medicare reform, but also real-
izes that the country needs to 
move in realistic steps. The goal 
of universal health care will take 
time; Gore's plan, Medi-coverage, 
shows the realistic steps America 
can take to solve its health ca re 
problems. Rather than forcing 
families to find private insurance, 
Gore proposes to use 15-16 per-
cent of the budget surplus to 
insure 15 million Americans who 
are uninsured today. Under 
Gore's plan, 15 million more 
Americans receive health cover-

lion people must look for private 
insurance.

America enjoys today.

Senator John McCain not to use 
soft money in the general elec-
tion. Gore has not done anything 
comparable.

How can our country move 
forward if people are still not 
accepted for the color of their 
skin? 

Gore supports affi rmati ve 
action and wants to end racial 
profiling, but there is much more 
to race than simply policies. 
Bradley recognizes that to 
achieve racial harmony, we mu t 
explore what i within our hearts. 
We must promote understand ing 
and tolerance both among the 
majority and minority races.

campus, and it should be well-
coordinated with existing UCSD 
transit assist programs, expanded 
Metropolitan Transit Bus lines 
and the Coaster. In addition, sur-
face streets should be upgraded 
to handle greater capacity. The 
city could also assist UCSD in 
expanding its parking. 

Second, as mayor, I would 
leverage a combination of UCSD 
investments with the city's rede-
velopment dollars to build more 
affordable housing units of UCSD 
students and staff. There are also 
opportunities within UCSD's 
neighborhoods for greater hous-
ing density (Le., more living units 
on less land) without decreasing 
our quality of life. But increased 
density can only be fully realized 
if we increase community ameni-
ties and services. 

Third, I would promote the 
development of high-tech and 
biotech campuses in San Diego 
that would serve the needs of 
UCSD students and s~ff, even 
though they could be miles away 
from La Jolla. These campuses 
create "critical mass" by combin-
ing higher education, private sec-
tor manufacturing and R&D, all

There is a lot the prjvate sector

opportunities and assist universi-
ties in developing curriculums 
that are more applicable to the 
real world . We can also combine 
commercial and university R&D 
resources to make both partners 
more successful. DIck........, 

I wiIJ promise to extend the San 
Diego Trolley system to the UCSD 
campus. As the former chair of the 
Metropolitan Transit 
Development Board, I know how 
to achieve this. With UCSD stu-
dents and an alumna on my cam-
paign staff, I know how important 
this is. As a parent of UC Berkeley 
and UC Riverside graduates and 
one current UCLA student, I know 
that transportation and parking is 
a concern to college students.

Your question asks how I, as

1. Expand the freeways as well 
as mass transit for those who can 
use it. 

2. Develop two new bay 
entrances so we can flush them 
with tidal action twice a day - just 
like you do at home. 

3. Oppose the ballpark unless 
the greedy owners pay for it them-
selves; I'd rather give a free lunch 
to homeless families on the street 
than stadium tycoons in skyboxes. 

4. Recognize sexism and repu-
diate racism, so the people of the 
future are not mired in old bad 
habits. 

5. Build a new city hall and cen-
tral library for efficient service to 
voters. Let the homeless move into 
the current city hall since their 
transience will protect them from 
asbestos contamination. 

6. Move the airport out of the 
residential district for safety, add 
a cargo port at Brown field and 
take the load out of Lindbergh 
with a new international airport 
in the northeast. 

7. Increase cruise ship and 
cargo handling in the port of San 
Diego and move the nukes out. 

8. Fire the crooks in the water 
department and require the water 
quality board to produce revenue 
by fining toxic pollut~ 

9. Choose a new police chief 
(like Roulette Armistead) who will 
not perpetuate profiling, racism or 
color-first justice.

As rnayor of San Diego, I don't 
have any direct influence at 
UCSD, either over the administra-
tion or students. However, my 
indirect influence will encourage 
the administration to create a 
campus that is as diverse as the 
city in which it resides. The tu-
dents at UCSD should reflect the 
diverse population in San Diego, 
and since the passage of 
Proposition 209, we have all wit-
nessed a decline in the asset of 
having people from all walks of 
life come and leain together in an 
institute for higher learning. Not 
only is it the responsibility of the 
college administration to manage 
10,000 more students, but it is also 
important that the administration 
of San Diego City offer assistance 
in the way of student internships, 
on-the-job training and job fairs. 
Both public and private institu-
tions should be encouraged to 
work with UCSD in community 
service, preparing students for the 
journey in the world of work. I 
also encourage places like the Che 
Cafe and the Speech Area at Price 
Center to maintain their presence 
and continue to offer students and 
supporters a place to express 
themselves politically and artisti-
cally. .

As mayor, I would do whatev-

with accomoQating additional

university and surrounding com-
munities to develop plans that 
accomodate both the neighbor-
hoods and the students, and 
would work to create more 
affordable on- and off-campus 
student housing and parking. I

BUSH: 
c..1It .... fNL ..... 
and extending American enter-
prise and influence around the 
world. All of these positions 
point to the message that Bush 
is a reformer who can get results 
in the White House. 

The 2000 campaign has cen-
tered on some personal issues 
concerning the two leading 
Republican candidates. In the 
debates between Bush, Sen. john 
McCain and former ambassador 
Alan Keyes, smearing personal 
attacks on Gov. Bush have not 
swayed him from his message 
and beliefs. Unlike McCain, 
Bush comes from outside 
Washington politics, giving a 
new and fresh viewpoint on the 
issues concerning Americans. 
Most recently, Bush came under 

McCAIN: -
c. U D ............ 
moderate Republicans and rnany 
Democrats and Independents. In 
regards to the ever-controversial 
topic of abortion, though McCain 
considers h!mself to be pnrlife he 
would allow for abortions in 
severe cases such as rape, incest or 
if the life of the mother is in dan-
ger. And, as with most Americans, 
McCain stresses a ban on late-
term abortions. 

[n light of the recent spree of 
school shootings, the senator has 
repeatedly called for tighter gun 
control and has pushed through 
Congress regulations on guns, 
aimed at limiting firearm accessi-
bility. However, McCain is per-
haps best known for his continu-
ous calls for campaign finance 
reform - his attempt, somellmes 

fire for a visit to Bob Jones 
University in South Carolina, 
which prohibits interracial dat-
ing and has an anti-Catholic sen-
timent. Bush stood strong by 
stating that he disagreed with 
the school's policy. 

On March 4, Bush issued a 
statement on the decision by the 
university to reverse the interra-
cial dating ban, saying, "I'm 
heartened to hear that Bob jones 
University has reversed its ban 
on interracial dating. It was 
wrong to begin with, and. that's 
why r spoke out against the ban 
when I was asked about it at a 
news conference immediately 
after my visit there. Tonight, the 
school has done the right thing." 
The attempt to lay blame by 
aSllOCiation has not diminished 
the governor's message as a 
leader. 

Other aspects of the cam-

seeming like a private vendetta, 
to rid Washington of the very 
influential special interests 
groups. He has always been a 
proponent of anti-smoking laws. 

All of these cases have alienat-
·ed the senator from the rest of the 
Republican Party, particularly the 
gun control issue. And strangely 
enough, strong-willed McCain 
would not want it any other way. 
Always independent and willing 
to speak his mind unlike other 
politicians, McCain has success-
fully separated himself from the 
conservative side of the GOP and 
was embraced by the more mod-
erate. The like, however, could 
not be said about his opponent, 
George W. Bush, the governor of 
Texas and son of former President 
George Bush. As a recent 
Newsweek article states of Bush, 
"Maybe Bush thought h could 
dominate these folks, but because

paign have also centered on the 
negative. Most importantly, the 
difference between McCain and 
Bush is Bush's ability to attract 
Republican voters to his cam-
paign. In every state, the 
Republican vote has over-
whelmingly gone to Bush 
because ,of his belief in conserv-
ative values. McCain has 
attempted to attract all kinds of 
voter groups in the primaries, 
including Democrats, libertari-
ans and vegetarians, in order to 
succeed. But only in states with 
open primaries has McCain 
gained any significant margin in 
the vote. In stat~ where only 
Republican votes count, McCain 
has lost. 

Additionally, McCain has 
alienated of social conservatives 
and Christian GOP voters by 
attacking leaders such as Pat 
Robertson and jerry Falwell, 

(George w. Bush) is so malleable, 
they ended up molding him." 
While Bush thoultht he would be 
the one in contro( he ends uf the 
one hung on the strings 0 the 
Christian Coalition. 

This portrays the inadequacies 
of Bush and the strength and res-
oluteness of McCain. And who 
are the "they?" They are the reli-
gious right that Bush has been 
courting as of late because he 
needed their votes in order to win 
several primaries down south. 

While Bush moves from mod-
erate to right and then back, 
pulled by the conservative reli-
gious, McCain has always sent 
out one conclusive message of 
moderation and acceptance. "He 
talks about morality in patriotic, 
not religious, terms," Newsweek 
writes of the senator. "He doesn't 
seek to expunge sin. He crusades 
against selfishness by the tobacco 

calling them "forces of evil." 
Many supporters of McCain 
have issued statements that the 
senator has gone too far in these 
remarks. Bush believes that in 
order to be successful in the pri-
maries, it is necessary to win the 
support of as many RepUblicans 
as he can. 

. His message of conservative 
values with a compassionate 
standard puts him on the level 
with great leaders like President 
Reagan. 

He has strongly denounced 
the politics of division and 
embraced the idea that only a 
leader that can unite the 
Republican Party has a chance 
to defeat the Democratic candi-
date in November. Gov. Bush is 
such a candidate. He is the only 
Republican who has a record of 
success and the initiative to 
sather people of diverging 

lobby, special interests, pork bar-
rel spenders or Gore fundraisers." 

With his latest switch from 
moderate to conservative, Bush 
was forced to acceft the anti-
abortion platform 0 the South, 
no exceptions,. not even rape. This 
will cost the governor ashe tries 
to pull himself toward the middle 
in more moderate states like 
Califomia and New York. 

This is what Sen. John McCain 
offers to the White House and to 
the people of the United States: a 
mode.rate approach to important 
issues, more accepting of different, 
more liberal views than his oppo-
nent and straight talk with unwa-
vering belief . With the five years 
spent in a decrepit POW camp, 
McCain learned loyalty, honor, 
patriotism and most of all sanctity. 
He promises to bring these virtues 
with him into a White House des-
perately needing them.

views in order to make progress. 
The March 7 primary in 

California will be a turning 
point in the campaign. With the 
most electoral seats, California 
plays a major role in the selec-
tion of the Republican nominee. 
In the latest polls, Bush leads 
McCain by a margin of 51 per-
cent to 28 percent among GOP 
voters. 

Californians must make the 
decision to support a candidate 
that can lead America into the 
21st century. UCSD students 
have the opportunity to support 
a man that can clearly reform 
and support education, increase 
defense and extend American 
international influence. The slo-
gan "Reformer with Results" 
sends the clear message that 
Bush has the ability to lead our 
nation. As a student, I support

Putin Shuns Confrontation 
MOSCOW Vladimir 

Putin, Russia's acting presi-
dent, in his first interview with 
a Western news organization, 
says Russia must be a "strong, 
powerful state" that sheds con-
frontational Cold War politics, 
avoids isolation from the West 
and remains willing to seek 
"more profound integration" 
with ATO, even by joining it 
so long as Russia "is regarded 
as an equal partner." 

Putin recorded the inter-
view last Tuesday with Sir 
David Frost of British 
Broadcasting Corp. It was 
broadcast Sunday, and was also 
picked up by Russian televi-
sion networks. 

Though there is little. 
prospect that Russia will 
become a member of NATO 
anytime soon, Putin's remarks 
clearly were tailored to a 
Western audience, emphasizing 
a desire to develop stronger ties 
with the West as Russia 
rebuild its economy. 

They they also revealed his 

eagerness to reduce the tensions 
over NATO's eastward expan-
sion and the bombing campaign 
in Yugoslavia. 

"A ttempts to exclude us 
from the process is what causes 
opposition and concern on our 
part," he said, referring to 
NATO, "but that does not 
mean we are going to shut our-
selves off from the rest of the 
world. Isolationism is not an 
option." 

The Russian leader gave a 
spirited defense of his coun-
try's military campaign in the 
breakaway southern region of 
Chechnya, comparing rebel 
forces there to "Nazi crimi-
nals." 

Responding to reports of seri-
ous human rights abuses by 
Russian forces, he said, "If there 
are facts of cruelty, of crimes 
against peaceful citizens of 
Chechnya, then that goes against 
the aims that the Russian leader-
ship sets itself." 

Though Putin has a com-
manding lead in public opin-

ion polls to win the March 26 
presidential election, he said, 
"I am not inclined to believe 
that I am assured of victory, 
that I have it in my hand, that 
the campaign is over." 

He now leads his closest 
rival, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, 
the Communist Party leader, 
by nearly 40 percentage points. 

Sunday, after the BBC broad-
cast the interview, Zyuganov 
criticized Putin's statements on 
joining NATO as "naive and 
unpardonable for a politician of 
his level." 

Putin said his desire to 
rebuild Russia into a "strong, 
powerful state" had "nothing 
to do with aggression ." He 
added, "If we again and again 
go back to the terminology of 
the Cold War, we are never 
going to discard attitudes and 
problems that humanity had to 
grapple with a mere 15 to 20 
years ago."

PINOCHET: 
Lagos spoke out 
after 27 -year silence 
Coittl sell ........... 1 
turbed many Chileans, reopening 
old worries about the military's 
influence and starting a new 
debate about whether the former 
dictator will attend Lagos' inau-
guration next weekend. 

As the first Socialist to govern 
Chile since Salvador Allende was 
overthrown in a 1973 military 
coup, Lagos was careful during 
and since the presidential cam-
paign to characterize his relations 
with the top military brass as 
respectful and positive. On 
Saturday, however, during a 
beach retreat with his future min-
isters, he told reporters that "the 
country suffered" from the wel-
come accorded Pinochet. 

"A tremendous effort will be 
made to demonstrate to the world 
that this is a democratic country, 
where authority is chosen by the 
people and where the armed 
forces are di~iplined and obedi-
ent," Lagos said. . 

They were among the most 

Monday, March 6, 2000 

pointed words a civilian leader 
has uttered toward the military 
since civilian government 
replaced the Pinochet dictator-
ship in 1990 under a constitution 
that continues to give the armed 
forces independent powers over 
promotions, the military budget 
and representation in the Senate. 

Lagos' comments were pub-
lished as new details emerged 
about the ceremony staged for 
Pinochet, who returned after 16 
months of house arrest outside 
London under a Spanish warrant. 
The British home secretary, Jack 
Straw, released the former dicta-
tor, ruling that he was not physi-
cally or mentally fit to stand trial 
in Spain on charges he committed 
gross human rights abuses dur-
ing his 17-year rule. 

lt is virtually unimaginable 
that the 84-year-old former dicta-
tor will return to a position of 
influence. By embracing him, the 
military seems to want to assure 
that its own political position is 
not unduly damaged by the con-
tinuing fallout from Pinochet's 
humiliating arrest in London.

States Protect Parents 
Who Abandon Babies 

Boycott Ov. Confederate Flag 
Has Spoiled Spoleto Fesitval 

CALIMESA, Calif. - Simple 
white crosses and pinwheels 
spinning quietly in the breeze 
mark the graves of 38 abandoned 
babies buried in a cemetery here. 
Anonymous in death, the babies 
were given names and proper 
funerals by a stranger. 

The efforts of that stranger, Debi 
Faris, a mother of three, began over 
three years ago when she heard the 
story of an infant found dead in a 
duffel bag and wanted to give the 
baby a proper burial. 

The county coroner gave per-
miSSion, a nd then asked if she 
would also take two others. 

So began the Garden of 
Angel , a mall bu rial area in a 
cemetery in the shadows of the 
Sa n Berna rdino Mountains. 

ow Faris is pushing for state 
legi lalion to offl r legal protec-
tion to parents who abandon their 
babies in safe places. 

"It's really very overwhelming 
when you go to a coroner 's office," 
she said. "They bring you a child 
wrapped in pIa tic and you look in -
their face. It's like ' Oh, God, what 
can we do to make this stop?'" 

Across the United Sta tes, law-

makers and prosecutors are 
beginning to ask that saine ques-
tion, weighing changes in laws 
that they hope might ~uce, if 
not eliminate, the number of 
infants found dead each year 
after being abandoned. 

Although the laws' vary in 
their details, generally they 
would allow parents to avoid 
prosecution for child abandon-
ment if they left their babies in a 
safe place. The laws are typically 
intended to protect infants. . 

Te as enacted such a law in 
September, becoming the first 
state to do so. The bill was passed 
as Houston was experiencing a 
rash of abandonments. 

Now 23 other states, including 
California, New York and ew 
Jersey, have proposed legislation. 
At the same time, district attor-
neys in Minnesota and Alabama 
are decIJning to prosecute women 
who leave their babies with des-
ignated officials such as emer-
gency-room personnel, and are 
sending the women instead to 
social-service agencies for help.

The New York Times 

The director of the highly 
regarded Spoleto Festival' USA 
in Charleston, S.c., says he is 
determined to put on this year's 
event despite an economic boy-
cott organized to protest the fly-
ing of the Confederate battle flag 
over the state Capitol. 

Because of the boycott, called 
by the state branch of the 
National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People, 
one of the festival's marquee per-
formers, Bill T. Jones, has with-
drawn his dance company from 
the festival. In addition, at least 
half a dozen performers, includ-
ing Patti laBelle and the O'Jays, 
have canceled other concerts in 
the state in the last month. 

Still, Nigel Redden, Spoleto's 
general director, said that 
despite his personal opposition 
to the flying of the flag, the 18-
day festival, which runs from 
May 25 to June 11 and is the pre-
eminent arts event in the 
Southeast, would go on. 

He also said that he hoped 
that the flag, which the NAACP 

and its allies regard as a symbol 
of racism, would be removed 
before the end of the legislative 
session, which runs until June 1 
and overlaps with Spoleto. 

If it is removed and the boy-
colt is ended, Jones will per-
form, both the dancer and 
Redden said. 

On Friday, Redden and the 
Spoleto board's executive com-
mittee issued a statement saying 
that while they supported the 
flag's removal, all the artists 
scheduled to appear had been 
asked to do so in spite of the 
boycott "because the festival 
strongly believes that the arts 
have a unique ability to stimu-
late debate, draw people togeth-
er and ultimately to change 
them in ways nothing else can." 

Redden said that no corpora-
tions or foundations had with-
drawn their support because of 
the boycott, but that "two corpo-
rations we had been courting 
said it would be difficult at this 
time." 

He said it was too early to 

dete.rmine what impact the boy-
colt might have on ticket sales, 
which are slightly up from this 
time last year. 

Spoleto USA has a major 
impact on the South Carolina 
economy. Last year the state esti-
mated that the festival had gen-
erated $1 billion in local spend-
ing since it began in 1977 as the 
U.S. counterpart of the festival 
founded in Spoleto, Italy, by 
Gian-Carlo Menolli. 

The speaker of the South 
Carolina House, David H. 
Wilkins, who defends the battle 
flag as a symbol of tradition, 
said, "I would like very much to 
resolve this issue with dignity 
and finality." 

He has proposed removing 
the flag to the Confederate 
Soldiers Monument in front of 
the Capitol, but the NAACP has 
rejected the idea, and both sides 
appear to be hardening their 
positions.

"The pervasive way they

its sort of intimidating." 

He said that if Carley had cho-
sen to speak in a lecture hall, stu-
dents coula choose to attend or 
nol. 

"But speaking in such a public 
area infringes upon the rights of 
the 'students," Weisberg said. 
"When they force their views 
upon others, its problematic." 

He said he agrees to disagree 
with their ideology, but their way 
of spreading their message on 
campus is so evangelical and 
intolerant.

-Vice President Gore strongly 
opposes the legalization of any 
drug, H Wmterguard said. "He is in

drug rehabilitation to those who 
have fallen off the beaten path." 

Bates also responded to the 
question. 

"I think all the issues -
whether it's drug use or drinking 

beliefs." 
Roosevelt sophomore Nimrod 

Pitsker said that he came to the 
Price Center see what the "infa-
mous" Michael had to say and 
what slant he would take. 

"I wanted to see if he'd say 
'my way is the only way' or if 
other ways are embraced and tol-
erated," Pitsker said. 

Muir junior Albert Man, a 
supporter of the movement, said 
the message that is being spread 
is that of salvation through 
Jesus. 

"There is only one way and if 
you don't believe then you are 
going to hell," he said to fellow 
students in the Price Center 
Friday. "The only to be saved is 
through Jesus." 

Marshall sophomore Eric 
Hoover said Man's message 
offended him. 

"The root of my problem is that 
you are imposing your ideas that 
I'm going to Hell since I don't 
agree with you," Hoover said.

"I think that the drug problem in 
America should be addressed at 
the consumption level rather than 
trying to stop the flow of drugs 
into the country. I do think that 
it's a personal decision made on 
an individual basis of those who 
!lave to deal with it but I really 
don't have a problem with look-

Bates added that those were his 
views and that Bradley does not 
support the legalization of drugs.

She said that she agrees with 
Michaets message, but does not

sure tactics to involve people · 
with Christianity. 

"I agree with Michael, but I do 
not agree with his campaign that 
seems to single out Christians as 
the good and the rest as the bad," 
Flores said. Christ did not con-

Muir freshman Adam 
Klekowski, a Michael supporter, 
said their misSion isn't meant to 
be confrontational or judgmental. 

"They come to us if they have 
any questions. It's up to God to 
judge, not us. I don't believe it is 
intimidating," he said. "Our goal 
isn't to offend students, but to 
spread our message to those who 
ask." 

Roosevelt junior Greta 
Schuman, a member of the Hillel 
Jewish organization, said the 
Campus Crusade's Michael cam-
paign has broken the respect and 

on the minds of the students with 
respect to California's changing 
demographics and the diminish-

"The vice president is in favor 
of opening America's borders to 
immigrants. It should be a pari of 
our nation's experience," 
Winterguard said. "It provides a 
richness in diversity in America.

it is very difficult to map and

"What I see when I see the 
blue shirts is an advertisement: 
'We're right, we're right-look at

Bates expressed Bradley's sub-

tion quotas should be higher for 
America's neighbor Mexico.

other parts af the country,". Bates 
said. "Those of us who are a part 
of the problem and the previous

After the forum, the campaign 
representatives addressed ques-

ence such as campaign finance

next president. 

The forum was the first major

12 OPINION 

MAYOR: 
ContInued from .... t 
Redevelopment area. I will fight 
for fundin& to extend the trolley 
to UCSD In the future and it 
would be ideal to incorporate 
student housing along this tran-
sit corridor. 

Along with the need for stu-
dent housing is the need for facil-
ities torrevent overcrowding as a 
part 0 the classroom environ-
ment. A satellite campus may be 
an effective method of addressing 
this issue. Since UCSD plays such 
a critical role in the development 
of our high-tech engineering and 
biomedical industries, perhaps a 
graduate studies research facility 
loca ted near these industries 
would foster a closer link between 
San Diego's economy and UCSD. 

With the increase of popula-
tion in the San Diego region, traf-' 
fic is becoming an issue of increas-
ing concem. I have been and will 
continue to be a supporter of pro-
grams that facilitate mass transit. 
That is why I strongly believe that 
the trolley system must service 
UCSD, and as a member of the 
MTDB I am working on a plan to 
cut transit passes by 60 to 75 per-
cent for students. 

Lastly, a large part of the col-
lege experience for students is the 
environment in which they study 
and live. UCSD i blessed with a 
beautiful location along the ocean. 
As mayor of San Diego, I will 
fight to prevent the pollution of 
our beaches and bays and will 
work to conserve our open space.

tions or concerns, please feel free

quarters at (619) 222-WEAR or

Higher education and educa-
tion in general is essential to our 

survival and the survival of our 
planet's life support system, so of 
course r support education on all 
fronts. It's my view, that much 
more money needs to be spent on 
education on every level including 
paying students to pursue higher 
education. Many studies have 
shown that on avera~, people 
earning a university degree will 
pay 3 or more times more in taxes 
during their working liyes than 
people who only receive a high 
school education. This fact alone 
is economic reason enough to jus-
tify paying students to achieve 
higher levels of education. 

My challenge to higher edu-
. cation is to be more attentive and 
creative toward developing a life 
support sustaining economy to 
serve the needs of the present as 
well as the needs of future gener-
ations. If we fail in this, nothing 
else will matter in the long run. 

More specifically, educational 
institutions need to develop new 
curricula designed to teach us 
how to live and make livings on 
our planet in ways that are life 
support sustaining. The devel-
opment of such curricula does 
not mean that the subjects cur-
rently taught would be replaced. 
What it does mean is that these 
subjects would be taught from a 
life support system perspective. 
In other words, students should 
be encouraged to think critically 
about how the knowledge they 
gain in any subject area can be 
used to enhance the economic, 
social, and environmental well 
being of everyone, including the 
other life forms that share this 
planet with us. 

Another aspect of the role of 
education in helping us arrive at 
a sustainable future is in how 
educational institutions are 
designed and function. Toward 
that goal, schools on aU levels 
should be: ' 

1. Built and maintained using 

The UCSD Guardian 

resources that are mined, har-
vested, processed, transported, 
and used in ways that are life 
support friendly. 

2. Designed to maximize the 
efficient use of energy, water and 
other resources and be powered 
by renewable energy resources. 
In low rainfall areas, educational 
institutions should be designed 
fo collect rainwater to store in 
underground. cisterns. 

3. Avoid the use of toxic mate-
rials in construction or mainte-
nance so that students, faculty 
and other personnel will not be 
exposed to unhealthy off-gassing 
during nonnal use or during fires.

As mayor of the City of San 
Diego, I would meet with repre-
sentatives from the University of 
California, San Diego to deter-
mine a plan to fulfill their need 
to accommodate 10,000 more 
students over the next 10 years. r 
would secure the support and 
commitment of accommodating 
these additional students from 
Richard Atkinson, the president 
of the University of California 
system and former chancellor of 
UCSD, who I believe knows first 
hand the needs of UCSD. By 
meeting with Gov. Gray Davis 
and members of the California 
State Legislature I would secure 
funding to make this project pos-
sible. 

once proposed development 
has been outlined, I would "fast 
track" the project through 
Development Services to ensure 
permits and other development 
associated processes would not 
stall the project from being com-
pleted promptly in order for 
additional students to begin 
attending the university. 

~dditionally, I would II fast 
track" the Environmental Impact 
Report in order to not hold up 
the process while at the same 
time ensure that natural habitat 

around the university is pre-
served. The quality of life must 
be maintained as the City of San

Barbara Warden proved that 
she has the leadership required to 
be mayor of San Diego during her 
tenure as a council member. Her 
mayoral campaign has focused on 
sorrte of the most important pfOb. 
lems facing San Diego, and we 
believe that she is most capable of 
dealing with these issues. 

While a member of city coun-
cil, Warden proved her dedica-
tion to helping to reduce traffic 
in San Diego. Although there 
was no state money available for 
the completion of Route 56, 
Warden procured $90 million for 
the project. She also garnered $39 
million from the San Diego 
Association of Governments for 
making improvements to I-IS, 
again after Caltrans had insisted' 
there was no funding for it. As 
mayor she would continue this 
policy of fighting congestion by 
advocating the construction of 
additional freeways and mass 
transit systems. 

To accommodate the growth of 
San Diego in the 21st century, 
Warden plans to improve sewer 
and water infrastructure and 
manage city development effi-
ciently to prevent urban sprawl. 
She also supports increased poliC-
ing and gun safety laws. 

Warden's plans for education 
include plans to reduce class size, 
create additional library branches 
and get more computers for 
schools. As a city council member 
she played a vital role in imple-
menting the tonstruction of three 
new libraries.

dents to vote for Barbara Warden.

14 FEATIJRES The UCSD Guardian Monday, March 6,2000 

THE. EDITOR'S SOAPBO 
Michael and his followers corrupt the message of Christianity 
word of God and the message in 
the Bible. Unfortunately, we have 
recently seen this happen all 
across our campus. 

Last week 1 walked down 
Library Walk and felt sick to my 
stomach as 1 saw a sea of blue-
shirted "I Agree with Michael" 
people set up their tables and 
attempt to share (or shove, 
rather) the word of God down 
their fellow student's throats. I 
walked through Price Center 
and felt like I was going to vomit 
as I saw dozens of flyers that 
simply said, HDo You Agree with 
Michael?" Beyond my infuria-
tion with these tactics, however, 
I felt disappointed and sad-
dened that those who spread the 
word of God have come down to 
this. 

Despite their arguments, they do 
not respect the views of others -
they are preaching intolerance. 

These people have aided in the 
perpetuation of the divisions we 
already see here at UCSD. Not 
only do they set themselves apart 
from other UCSD students with 
their theories, attitudes and ide-
ologies, they even set themselves 
apart from the rest of campus 
with their blue T-shirts. With their 
"us vs. them" mentality, these 
hyper-evangelists have further 
dIvided our community. 

. incorrectly, but one of the main 
themes that I have always come 
across is that we, as Christians, 
should learn to love and accept 
all people. 

Even outside of the churm, 
without regard to Christianity, 1 
was always taught that we 
should love and tolerate one 
another. JOSEPH LEE 

Advertising Assistant 

First of all, let me tell our 
beloved readers that I am a 
Christian. J believe in God and I 
believe in most of the ideologies 
of the Christian faith. And you 
know what? I agree with 
Michael's philosophies, but not 
his tactics. 

Unlike Michael, I am not going 
to shove my Christianity into 
your face and down your throat 
until you choke on religion and 
projectile-vomit it across the 
room. I am not going to prostitute 
Christianity all over campus and 
cheapen the value of the lessons 
leamed in this faith - that is not 
the way to go about spreading the 

I debated with some of these 
people and listened to others 
debating with them. However, I 
was once again disappointed to 
hear them politely say that they 
"respect" the views of others, 
replying with obviously scripted 
retorts that seemed to come 
straight out of Evangelism 101. 

They continue to feed the per-
ceptions of intolerance that tend 
to be associated with 
Christianity in this society. They 
seem to promote the idea that 
Christians are incapable of truly 
accepting and respecting other 
religions and those individuals 
who do not bf> ieve in God. They 
continue to portray Christianity 
in the negative light in which It 
has seemed to Iall in recent 
times. 

Perhaps my years of learning 
about the Bible and God during 
Sunday school have taught me 

It Is unfortunate, but it seems 
that the notion of Christianity has 
become quite a turJH)ff for many 
people. The HI Agree With 
Michael" campaign is perpetuat-
ing this. These blue-slUrted rap-
scallions have soured the fruit of 
Christianity in the mouths of 
many students thereby turning 
students away from ChristianIty 
and ultimately away from the 
glory of God. 

1 agree that one of the main 
ideas of Christianity is mission-
ary work and evangelism. 

However, Michael's followers 
should have adopted a different 
way of going around and talking 
to people about God. 
Christianity will settle on deaf 
ears if it Is continually spread by

short, Tobin hooked me up! After I had found a place 
that I liked, he fought off other bidders until the place 
was ours. Tobin helped me every step of the way. He 
came to my apartment and took the forms and 
delivered them to the appropriate places for me. So 
now I have this property, but I won't even need it 
until next year-not a problem! Tobin found renters 
immediately. The condo will be paying for itself until 
I am ready to move in. He is simply the best!" •

folks who blanket the campus 
with religious jargon, propagan-
da and finger-pointing. I believe 
that instead, Christianity should 
be spread by example. 

The money spent by the 
Campus Crusade for Christ on 
the half-page advertisement in 
the GUJlTdilm, the dozens of flyers 
and the blue T-shirts could have 
been donated to charity organiza-
tions. The money could have 
been donated to the struggles of 
impoverished people in third-
world countries or to organize a 
canned food drive or soup 
kitchen for the homeless in down-
town San Diego or other sur-
rounding areas. 

If the Michael people wanted 
to share the message of God, 
there are numerous ways they 
could have done this - through 
ltOOd deeds that demonstrate 

~d hearts. Showing people this 
sort of kindness would have p0s-
itive effects on the student body 
and the reputation of Christianity, 
rather than negative. 

The time, effort and energy 
spent on this entire campaign 
should have been directed 
toward an attempt to solve more 
pressing issues in our society, 
such as the constant destruction 
of our environment, the violence 
in our cities and schools, racism, 
sexism, poverty, the severe lack 
of diversity on this campus and 
the lack of tolerance we see in 
this world. Unfortunately, 
Michael and his followers decid-
ed to waste their time, as well as 
ours. 

The love for God that these 
blue-shirted fanatics proclaim to 
have should be shown in such a 
manner that does not make pe0-
ple uncomfortable about 
em.bracing Christianity and in a 
manner that does not make pe0-
ple uncomfortable because of 
their own ~ligious or nonreli-
gious beliefs. this hyper-evan-
gelism will only serve to further 
divide the campus; it will con-
tinue to portray many Christians 
as overly conservative and inca-
pable of being tolerant and 
respectful toward the beliefs of 
others. 

I agree with the basics of what 
Michael is trying to say, but I 
vehemently disagree with how he 
and this cult-like following go 
about forcing religion into the 
faces of students. 

If these "Christians" expect to 
teach others or at least let others 
become aware of Christianity and 
the power of God, they should 
first value the differences 
between themselves and others 
and not perpetuate this separatist 
viewpoint that continues to 
divide our campus. 

I am thoroughly disheartened 
by the actions of my fellow 
Christians. In my debate with the 
people who agree with Michael, I 
argued that r was angered and 
saadened that they are leading 
more and more people away 
from Chriatianity. 

One follower looked at me 
and placidly said in an institu-
tional tone, "'Then pray for us. H 

And I wiU. because they will 
need all the help they can get.

at around $5. Students can also 
buy a quarterly membership for 
$45. 

For those who have never 
done any rock climbing before, 
staff members will teach students 
the basics for free. This is signifi-
cant, because at other rock climb-
ing facilities, an initial lesson can 
cost upwards of $50. 

The student response to 
Outback Adventures, for those 
who have participated, appears . 
to be quite positive. 

For instance, students initially

Not surprisingly, the Outback

Artists Lane is completely stu-

There, students can rent and 
purchase all kinds of equipment

carries everything from tents and

One of the biggest challenges 
for the program's coordinators 
has been gaining publicity.

group outings include one-day 
byaking trips to La Jolla Shores 
or Mission Bpy, one-day rock 
climbing trips to Mount Woodson 
and three - six-day sea kayaking 
trips in Baja. 

A typical outing occurs as fol-
lows: The group meets at a spe-
cific rendezvous point; passen-
ger vans provided by Outback 
Adventures are loaded; students 
spend the weekend participating 
in whatever outdoor event is 
specific for that weekend and 
finally, students are dropped off 

where they start-a bigger audience. 
Grube views this 
as an unfortunate 
thing for the 
UCSD community 
as a whole. 

"Especially for 
college students 
who have so many 
responsibilities as 
it is, this program

free time," Grube said. "Outback 
Adventures is one of the moSt 
underutilized resources on cam-
pus. lt's a shame because so many 
students who actually go with us 
on an outing end up having such 
a great time." 

Unlike most other recreation 
classes, Outback Adventures is a 
program that is available to stu-
dents throughout the quarter. 
Since an outing occurs every 
week, students can sign up days 
before the event. In addition, 
there is no obligation to continue 
participating in the program. 
Students can try as many or as 
few outings as they like. 

Group adventures are also 
available for campus organi.za-
tions, clubs or other private par-
ties. Outback Adventures will 
accommodate up to 20 people for 
an event. According to the UCSD 
Recreatioll Magazine, popular 

will be able to 
purchase all sorts of outdoor 
equipment: kayaks, tents, wet-
suits, sleeping bags, snow boards, 
paddling jackets, skis and much 
more. 

Another upcoming event is a 
mountain bike clinic in the 
Cuyamaca Mountains scheduled 
for the weekend of June 2. The 
highlight of the trip will be a jour-
ney to Julian, where students will 
be able to feast on all the home-
made apple pie they can eat.

up a 6-1 advantage in game two. 
With some good nustle plays and 
dives for balls, UCSD's effort put 
it back into the game. The Tritons 
also pulled some big plays out of 
their hats. 

By ROBERT FULTON 
Associate Sports Writer 

The UCSD golf team fared 
well in the 50th AMuaI Southern 
California Intercollegiate Golf 
Championship this weekend at 
the south end of the Torrey Pines 
Golf Course. 

The results were 

tors, including those of the 
university division. Andy 
Crain of the University of 
North Carolina, Greensboro -
the only school at the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Golf 
Championship not from 
California - had the best 

score of all competitors with 
a 150. 

" I think [the Regals] came 
back in the second half," Malone 
said. "Just a missed shot here and 
there and we could have been in 
it." 

With the score 9-2 Tigers, 
Jordan Hove fired up the crowd 
with a quick kilL Hite's block on 
the near side made it 9-3. Hove 
got another block after a UCSD 
point to make it 9-5. After a net 
violation by the University of 
Pacific, the Tritons looked as if 
they were climbing back into it. 
However, the Tigers pulled ahead 
11-6 with some monster smashes. 

divided into two cate-
gories - university 
division and college 
division. 

~-......... Donahoe was the 

Cal Lutheran took its biggest 
lead of 11 points when it went up 
59-48 with just under seven min-
utes left. 

With 22 seconds remaining, 
the Tritons pulled to within three 
after an Ashley Kokjohn foul 
shot, setting the score at 69-66. 
The Regals held on, however, and 
pulled for a victory. 

Renee Hudec led the Triton 
scorers with 15 points. Neal 
scored 11 points and Genevieve 
Ruvald scored 10 as well as 
added six assists and four steals. 

Injuries plagued the team 
early in the season, but the squad 
united and stepped up 10 muster 
a handful of record-setting ~icto­
ries. ''I'm very happy with the 
season," Malone said. " It was a 
tremendous season. We were 
young at key positions. We only 
had two four-year seniors. 
Everyone on the team stepped up 
to the plate. I am very proud of 
this team." Despite Wednesday'S 
loss, Malone is positive about 
next season. 

"One bad game doesn' t label a 
season, it just ends the season," 
Malone concluded. 

A few Triton attacks fell out of 
bounds, which typified UCSD's 
erroneous play in this match . 
Outside hitter Dylan Herrick 
punched in a service ace on 
game point for the second game 
victory. 

The UCSD struggle continued 
in the next period and the Tigers 
nailed the match victory. 

"They say that you have to 
serve 'em in and hit 'em in," 
Larsen said. "If you don't play 
that way, you won't win. I wish 
we had the performance last 
night that we did tonight," 
Larsen said after the second game 
of the weekend following 
Saturday'S loss to Pepperdine. 

The next game for UCSD is 
against Division I powerhouse 
Loyola Marymount University 
Tuesday at 7 p.m. at RIMAC 
Arena. 

The Tritons will then hit the 
road and play Vassar College in 
New York. Come out this week 
and cheer for the Tritons! 

UCSD dominated 
the college diviSion, 
with its A and B teams 
taking first and second 
places. 

The university division 
contains Division r, Division II 
and NA!A teams. The college 
division is for Division 11 
teams. 

"The university division is 
for those schools with scholar-
ships or with the opportunity 
for scholarships," UCSD goff 
Head Coach Mike Wydra said. 
"College division is for non-
scholarship programs." 

After a first-day score of 
325, the Tritons' A team 
grabbed the top spot in the 
college division with a two-
day score of 638. 

The 'B' team also shot a 325 
in the first round and came in 
second with an overall 644. 

UCSD's James Donahoe 
took the top spot for the Tritons 
as well as the college division 
by shooting a 151. 

Donahoe nearly had the 
best score of all the competi-

Dan Warburton, who 
shot a 152. 
The B team's Lennie 

Langford shot a 155, good for 
second place in the college 
division and a tie for ninth 
overall. 

Darin Sullivan of the 
Tritons' A squad and Ben Page 
of UCSD's B team tied for 
ninth in the college division as 
each shot a 162. 

"We did ,r,retty well," 
Wydra said. 'We baSically 
have two strong players in 
Donahoe and Sunivan. Darrin 
had been sick. His talent is so 
large that he [along with 
Donahoe) will be a cut above 
everyone else." 

The A team's score of 638 
was good enough for fourth 
overall and tnird out of 
California competitors. 

The Triton B team's 644 
won it sh<th rlace overall and 
fifth out 0 the California 
squads. 

"We could have fielded a C 
team and beat most of the 

schools in the college divi-
sion," Wydra said . 

Cal State Bakersfield fin-
ished first of the California 
teams with a 617 and was 
awarded for its performance. 
However, in a showing of 
good faith, Bakersfield gave 
the hardware to Greensboro, 
who actually finished first 
with a 611 but was not quali-
fied to take tropbies. 

"That was one of the classi-
est moves in college golf," 
Wydra said. 

Other San Diego finishers 
on the A team were David 
Hansen, Andy Thomp-son and 
Ryan Brown, who all shot 167. 

Additional Triton competi-
tors on the B team included 
Jeff Durston and Brian Revelli, 
each ' with scores of 166, and 
Rex Vanderpol with a 171-

"It's important for us to 
play at our own tournament," 
Wydra said . "Our guys 
weren't terribly happy about 
their scores. This helps us 
identify our top five. The la I 
three spots aren' t locked up 
yet. The difference between 
the A team and the B is so 
small and our squad is so 
large." 

UCSD heads back onto the 
links today and tomorrow 
when it plays on the Carlton 
Oaks Golf Course in Santee for 
the San Diego State Aztec 
Invitational. 

Coach Wydra hopes his 
team will improve upon its 
score from rast weekend's 
tournament.

up some quality victories. 

"We feel fike we accom-

we didn't win," Sanders said. 

The women's water polo 
team will face off against the 
University of Hawaii at 
Canyonview Pool. The Tritons 
lost 8-5 last time they faced 
Hawaii and are hoping for 
revenge. 

"This last weekend's tourna-
ment will be a good stepping 
stone for us to play, against 
Hawaii," Sanders said. "[t 
should be a great battle. Both 
teams will be improved since the 
last time we played." 

UCSD is in the midst of a 
fight for a position in the top 10 
rankings. Sanders and his team 
are excited and they' ll be having 
some "good workouts" this 
week in preparation for 
Hawaii's arrival in La Jolla. 

Both Hudson and Nesby 
played for the Sioux City Fall 
Skyforce of the CBA and it's 
about time for them to take the 
next flight out of LAX and return 
to wherever the hell Sioux City 
Fall is located. 

The other guard on the 
Clippers, Derek Anderson, is 
another inexperienced fellow 
who could learn a few lessons 
about how to play basketball 
from the other team in town by 
watching Bryant or anyone other 
than his own teammates. 
Anderson saw better days in col· 
lege at Kentucky. then he has with 
the Clippers in 1997. 

Aside from their drawbacks, 
the Clippers are really trying. 
They have summoned former 
Laker legend Kareem Abdul-
Jabaar out of retirement and have 
signed him as their assistant 
coach. 

I'm not sure how much he has 
helped the team, but I'm sure the 
tradition of winning and playing 
unselfish basketball that he brings 
with him couldn't make things 
any worse, but immediate trans-
formations in the team's level of 
success have not occurred. 

So, with the exception of 
Abdul-Jabaar 's coaching and 
Odom being named the Schick 
Rookie of the Month for 
November, I see nothing exciting 
about the L.A. Clippers this sea-
son - just like I never saw any-
thing exciting about them at any 
other point. 

From this, I can only gather 
that the benefits for NBA fans 
who care about the Clippers this 
season, or at least the only two 
that I can think of, are of a tawdry 

The second and final benefit 
on the list of good things coming 
out of this season for the Clippers 
is the enjoyment of the fans, or at 
least the enjoyment of those fans 
who have actually come to recent 
home ·games. That enjoyment is 
only received when fans point at 
each other when arguing how 
Abdul-Jabaar's coaching just 
might or might not turn the team 
around. 

Sadly, these two examples lead 
me to believe that there is no 
excuse to support this basketball 
team. Frankly, it's terrible that Los 
Angeles has the Clippers and 
allows them to play in a nice facili-
ty such as the Staples Center. I 
wish to God that they had been 
abandoned at the Iess-than-spec-
tacular L.A. Sports Arena, and 
with even lower attendance than 
at their new complex, their play 
would have degenerated to an 
unbearably ugly standard. 

Then, like the L.A . Rams, a 
group of money-hungry investors 
might offer the Clippers a stadium 
deal in some other dty, and the 
Clippers' owner would seize this 
opportunity to relocate and start 
anew. 

The Clippers used to play in 
San Diego before moving to Los 
Angeles, and this move did not 
prompt any success. Maybe if the 
team leaves the cursed profes-
sional sports world of Los 
Angeles, it will finally discover 
the meaning of greatness. 
However, it appears that at least 
for now, the Clippers will contin-
ue to be the basketball opening 
act for the Lakers' main event in 
the ci.ly of Los Angeles.

Without a doubt the 
worst in the West 

They say the best way to 
win an argument is to stay out 
of one. I agree with this state-
ment considering what's on 
my mind wi th respect to the 

BA. It's not that I'm tired of 
disagreeing with everyone 
else's opinion about how good 
teams and players are, it's just 
that I don't possess much 
knowledge on the subject. On 
the other hand, I'm not totally 
oblivious, and if someone 
were to tell me something to 
the effect of "the Los Angeles 
Clippers show promise for the 
near future," my retort would 
be to lambaste this person to 
silence. 

Usua lly, I'd prefer to 
express my views about the 

FL or even Major League 
Baseball rather than my views 
about pro-basketball . The 
truth is, I hav.e a one-track 
mind headed in the direction 
of the Lakers every year when 
it comes time for the NBA sea-
son. That is why I have a spe-
cial place in my heart for con-
stantly insulting and ridicul-
ing the Clippers, who, due to 
an unfortunate series of histor-
ical events and economically 
advantageous arrangements, 
ended up playing on the same 
damn court as the Lakers. 

However, one great advan-
tage for Laker fans from hav-
ing the hopeless Clippers in 
town was lower ticket prices at 
the Staples Center when the 
teams play each other. Missing 
the sight of my least favorite 
basketball team getting 
crushed by my favorite basket-
ball team by 30 points on Jan. 4 
was an unfortunate situation. 
And so is the Clippers' associ-
!1tion with the City of Angels 
- they don' t deserve more 
than a mention in the L.A . 
Times' sports section. Lucky 
for L.A . sports fans, the 
Clippers aren't doing well at 
aU this season, so we shouldn't 
have to read about them. 

I' ll give them credit for 
acquiring talented rookie 
Lamar Odom from the 
University of Rhode Island. His 
16.2 points per game this sea-
son is higher than Laker all-star 
Kobe Bryant's mark in that cat-
egory during his first two 
years. 

[ also have respect for 
Odom's performance during 
his NBA debut in the first game 
of the season when he racked 
30 points and 10 rebounds. In 
this particular game, however, 
the other burns around him 
failed to produce enough for 
the Clippers to win, and they 
lost by 12 points to Seattle. 

Who comprises this non-
productive element of the 
Clippers? It is guys like guard 
Troy Hudson and forward 
Tyrone Nesby who have no 
more than the age of the build-
ing they play in to show for in 
terms of NBA experience, and 
who pale in comparison to any 
guard and forward even on 
fhe Lakers' bench, let alone the 
Lakers' starting lineup.

Regal Win Ends UCSD's Run 
BASKETBALL: The women's team gets closed out by the Cal Lutheran Regals 72-66 at RIMAe 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Associate Sports Editor 

The fantastic voyage that the 
UCSD women's basketball season 
had become came to a crashing 
halt Wednesday" as the Tritons fell 
to the California Lutheran 
University Regals 72-66 in 
the first round of 
the NCAA 
Division III 
playoffs. 

"[ don' t 
think we played 
well," Triton Head Coach 
Judy Malone said. "[ think we 
were a little intimidated. "[Cal 
Lutheran] were playoff-tested. 
For a lot of our players, this was 
their first playoff experience. We 

• played a little timid - we were 
afraid to take a shot and we 
weren' t as aggressive as we had 
been in the past." 

The Tritons finished the year 
with an overall record of 20-6. Cal 
Lutheran, now sportin~ a 19-6 
mark after Wednesday s game, 
will continue in the NCAA play-
off tournament. 

The game was all Regals -
UCSD did not hold the lead at 
any time during the contest. 

After Cal Lutheran retcieved 
the opening tip, Monica Flores 
buried a three-pointer to open the 
game with a 3-0 lead. Having 
sank this first shot, the visitors 
never looked back. Before the 
Tritons could get their game off 
the ground, the Regals already 
had a 12-3 lead jus~ 3 minutes and 
30 seconds into play. 

"We didn' t feel we were out of 
it at that point," Malone said. 
"Two out of the three previous 
games before that we came back 
from being down 10, so it was just 
something we could do. We were 

doing some things well, but I told 
them to focus on playing defense 
and boxing out. I told them to do 
the things they need to in order to 
win the game." 

The Tritons then shook their 
playoff jitters and refocused their 
minds in order to battle back. 

Two minutes later, it 
was the Regals who had 

reason to be 
nervous as 
UCSD nar-
rowed the 

opponent' lead to 12-10 
on a Mindy Misawa layup. 

That was as close as the Tritons 
would come to presenting a chal-
lenge to their opponents. 

Flores dropped a layup in and 
added another three-pointer to 
give Cal Lutheran a comfortable 
19-10 lead. 

UCSD' was kept at arm's 
length for the rest of the half, only 
challenging the Regals when the 
Tritons were trailing 30-28 after 
Kim Neal took a Misawa pass and 
laid it in. 

The last 15 seconds of the first 
half may have decided the game's 
fate. . 

Down only two points after 
being outplayed in the first stan-
za, the Tritons would have been 
happy going into the break at this 
point after being down by as 
many as nine. 

Unfortunately, Cal Lutheran's 
Nicole Sanchez had other ideas. 

Sanchez buried a last-minute 
three-pointer and thwarted 
UCSD's momentum to give her 
team a 33-28 lead heading into 
the break. 

The second half was an amaz-
ing display of Regal shooting 
accuracy: Cal Lutheran shot 65

Tigers and Waves Overcome Men's Volleyball Team 
SMOKED: Despite threat~ning Pepperdine, the Tritons are swept by two more solid opponents 
By BRIAN WEU.ES 
.Associate Sports Editor 

Close, but no cigar .... 
The Tritons came to battle on 

Saturday night vs. the University 
of Pepperdine Waves and came 
close to stealing the final two 
games of the match before losing 
at home 15-3, 15-13, 15-12. 

The Waves were led by outside 
hitter Andre Breuer from Berlin, 
Germany. Breuer entered 
Saturday night's game with 277 
kills on the season for a 6.0 aver-
age per game, which is tops in 
Division r. UCSD also had to face 
Breuer 's accomplice in 
Pepperdine's other outside hitter, 
junior Scott Wong. Wong only 
trails Breuer in the team kill total 
by 20. The Waves had only lost 
one game prior to last week~nd's 
matchup with UCSD; the Tritons, 
on the other hand, had not won a 
game versus a 0-1 team since last 
season. 

So, Saturday had all the mak-
ings for a shellacking of the 
Tritons at the hands of the pow-
erhouse visiting from Malibu. 
Despite the Waves' display of the 
kind of Division I mastery and 
physical prowess that teams have 
been fleXing at the Tritons all sea-
son in the first game, UCSD hit 
thttourtsJor the firta'l twb·g\ltIfes 

in a hungry and energized mood. 
As UCSD pulled ahead to a 4-1 
lead in game two, one could 
sense that the Tritons smelled 
blood in the water, and they 
began to elevate their play to the 
level of skill and power of their 
opponent. 

The Tritons had a nice 

either." 
UCSD continued to stare the 

lion in its eyes and pulled to with-
in two points after the timeout. 
Eamie Yun and Zack Hite teamed 
up for a block on a Pepperdine 
player and then Yun smashed a 
kill into the feet of two 

Pepperdine defenders to 
offensive flow going and .................. make it a 12-10 game. The 
were passing 
and rallying 
beautifully . 
Donald Chen 
went on a cross-court 
killing spree in the second 
and third games, which opened 
up UCSD's offense to do other 
things such as attack the center of 
the court with off-speed hits and 
exploit the Waves' backcoult. 

One would think that 
Pepperdine would just let up on 
its offensive power toward the 
end of both games, but the Waves 
weren't about to give anything up 
to UCSD once the Tritons took it 
down to the wire. 

During the second game 
UCSD was trailing by only four 
with the score at 12-8, and Head 
Coach Ron Larsen called a time-
out. 

"I just told them that we're in 
this game and that we've got to 

~ playing," Lanen sate:[ "We 
Un r affotd cfny' hitting etrOrli 

score got to 13-
12 and then 13-
13 after a service 
ace by Chen; 

that was the closest 
UCSD would get to ov.er-

coming the Waves. Pepperdine 
scored the last two points for the 
15-13 victory. 

"We knew what they were 
doing and what kind of game 
they were going to come out 
with tonight, and we played our 
hardest to match that, n Larten 
said. 

Chen led all 1iitons In the 
scoring department with 18 kills. 
ACI088 the net, to no one's sur-
prise, big Breuer recorded 11 and 
middle-blocker [)oMY Killian

firie defensive play on s.tUrday 
with six dip. . At a team,

Other leading scorers for the 
Tritons included Yun and Kevin 
Flyrm, who knocked down seven 
kills apiece. Junior Ajmal Wardak, 
in his return to the Triton starting 
squad, after suffering a severe 
ankle sprain in the first game of 
the season, turned in a nice per-
formance with four kills and five 
digs. 

On Friday, things didn't fare 
as well for the Tritons as Larsen 
arid his team had expected -
UCSD lost the match 15·9, 15-8, 
15-5. The Tritons were a little 
sloppier in this game against the 
University of Paofic ngers. To 
their disadvantage, the Tritons 
racked up a higher-than-average 
mark in the error column with 
33-

. In addition, UCSD had to find 
a way to stop another star from 
outside the United States on 
Friday. This time, it was junior 
outside hitter Vladimir Andric 
from Croatia, who averages 4.9 
kills per game this season. Andric 
led a powerful UOP 1iger teem to 
victory at RlMAC Arena. 

"I was not happy with our per-
formance," Larsen said. "Key 
players did not play well."
