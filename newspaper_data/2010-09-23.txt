Visual arts associate professor 
Ricardo Dominguez has been cleared 
of one of two high-profile investiga-

tions that threat-
ened his tenure 
last year.

Last year, 
D o m i n g u e z 
worked on with 
other visual arts 
d e p a r t m e n t 
members to cre-
ate cell phone 
technology, called 
the Transborder 

Immigrant Tool, to aid immigrants 
crossing the US-Mexico border. 

The application — which helped 
immigrants locate water stores and 
avoid border patrol — was controver-
sial due to issues regarding the legality 
of helping illegal immigrants.

In April, about 200 students and 
faculty members engaged in a silent 
march to protest the investigation. 
According to Dominguez, university 
officials had been informally inves-
tigating him since January for his 
involvement in creating the phone 
application.

His application has received criti-
cism from several congressmen, who 
drafted an open letter to Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox to urge her to stop 
using state-provided university funds 
for Dominguez’s project.

The investigation, conducted by 
UCSD Audit & Management Advisory 
Services, began on January 11 and 
came to a close on July 23, clearing 
Dominguez of the charge.

In the final report for the 
Transborder Immigrant Tool investi-
gation, administrators wrote that the 
project did not entail any improper use 
of university funding or labor

“It is a positive end to that inves-
tigation, and we are hoping now to 
move forward on the proposal and the 
project,” Dominguez said.

Though the investigation ended 
on July 23, Dominguez discovered its 
conclusion in mid-August by accident 
when he received an e-mail intended 
for investigators. 

University spokeswoman Christine 
Clark declined to comment on the 
details of the investigation, directing all 
questions to the university’s statement, 
which stated that the university does 
not comment on personnel matters.

tigation surrounding Dominguez con-

FEED THE METER
By Matthew Stewart
staff writer

With all the hammering, hard 
hats and saw dust at every corner of 
UCSD, it’s hard to believe that only 
0.1 percent of the construction costs 
come from student registration fees.

UCSD currently has 16 construc-
tion projects either underway or in 
the works, totaling a cost of $1.75 bil-
lion. The 12 ongoing projects amount 
to nearly $750 million, while the 4 
pending projects total an additional 
$1 billion.

UCSD’s construction plans 
remain unaffected by the ongoing UC 
budget crisis because university debt, 
in the form of bonds or mortgages, is 
the the major source of funding. The 
bonds, which account for about $873 
million of total costs, are repaid by 
revenue earned from the buildings 
once they are constructed, or from 
reserve funds from the housing and 
medical departments which were set 
aside specifically to fund future proj-
ects. The mortgages for most new 
construction are standard 30-year 
contracts, though each is made at 
a different time, so the bonds have 
variable payoff dates.

“It’s a great time for construction,” 
Capital Planning Director Cara Fladd 
said. “Because of the economic down-
turn, we’re able to get great value for 
our projects. A lot of last-minute 
upgrades were made to some of the 
residence halls and other buildings.” 

Due to the recession, the cost of 
labor has decreased. Since several con-
struction projects were planned — and 
their budgets determined — before 
the economic downturn,  there was

Desperate to fill a $3 million gap in the transportation budget, administrators 
look to permits and weekend parking to make up the difference. By Jerry To

GUNS THIS SEPTEMBER. PAGE 12 

A CLOSER LOOK

Before the end of the year, students may find themselves hoarding quarters to cover the newly-imposed cost of weekend and night 
parking.

Proposed changes to parking costs made in 
early May have been tentatively scheduled for 
November. These changes are an attempt to recover 
from a $3-million funding deficit, caused by repair 
costs to the Arbor Parking Structure in Hillcrest 
Medical Center — which is projected to collapse 
in the next five to 10 years unless the structure is 
rebuilt. The total cost of the reconstruction is an 
estimated $30 to $50 million, with the expected 
completion date of 2015-18.

“If [TPS is] in a budget deficit, their options are 
to raise rates or cut services.” Transportation Policy 
Committee member Adam Powers said.

The two main proposals that would fund this 
reconstruction are the elimination of free weekend 
parking and an increase in the cost of daily parking 
permits. Under the plan, the price of the Occasional 
Use S Student parking permit would increase from 
$41 to $51, while the quarterly night and weekend 
permits would increase from $43 to $53. One-day 
permits would increase from $8 to $9 and one-
night permits would increase from $3 to $5.

The initiative to eliminate free weekend park-
ing passed with a majority vote by TPC. Originally, 
the changes were scheduled to take into effect 
beginning this summer. However, according to 
Transportation Services Executive Assistant Eliud 
Escobedo Jr., the implementation was postponed 
in order to receive more feedback from the stu-
dents.

“Signs saying as much were posted around cam-
pus, but after a while they went away,” Powers said. 
“I haven’t heard of anyone actually being ticketed for 
weekend parking, but no campus announcements 
have gone out clarifying this rather far-reaching 
change one way or another.”

TPS Director Brian d’Autremont said there is 
no set date for the changes to take place.

Another notable issue is the changes in MTS 
bus routes, which went into effect on Sept. 5 as

a result of increased transit funding from the 
state of California. Superloop 201/202 now goes 
through Lebon Drive, Arriba Avenue and Regents 
Road while Route 30 no longer does, only passing 
through La Village Drive to reach UTC.

D’Autremont said TPS will take this revision 
by MTS into consideration before making any 
changes in shuttle routes.

In addition, Powers said the Transportation 
Policy committee will continue to explore the pos-
sibility of a transportation referendum — a neces-
sary measure to mend the deficit. Transportation 
Services introduced the concept of a transportation 
referendum last year, but was rejected consistently 
by A.S. Council since a referendum has always

In Search of  a Surfer’s Soulmate: The Perfect Surfboard
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Megha Ram
Staff Writer

Though summer is drawing to a 
close and the temperatures are turn-
ing cool, graduate student Benjamin 
Thompson is still venturing into the 
now-chilly waters, all in the name of 
science.

Thompson is hitting the waves to 
find out what makes certain surfboards 
work better than others. Thousands of 
surfers worldwide have tried to deter-
mine the elements of the perfect surf-
board, with varied claims as to whether 
a stiff or flexible board is superior.

“A lot of veteran surfboard design-
ers and craftsmen have theories 
[about what makes a superior board], 
but no way to test them objectively,” 
Thompson said. “So I volunteered to 
do it. Now it has taken over my life.”

Thompson, a structural engineer-
ing student, is interested in optimal 
flexibility, or the ideal amount of 
bend in a surfboard. Although there 
are two main types of surfboards, 
Thompson chose to focus only on 

the short boards. His definition of the 
perfect board is one that reacts to an 
individual’s body.

“My hypothesis is that there is an 
optimum flex, and the optimum flex 
will be different for every rider, and 
for every rider it will be different for 
each wave type,” Thompson said.

To measure a surfboard’s optimal 
flexibility, Thompson and his team will 
solicit volunteer surfers of the same 
height, weight and foot size. Since the 
body type will remain the same for 
this stage of research, the surfboard is 
the only changing variable. Therefore, 
when the researchers film the surfers, 
they can see which surfboards perform 
better. In addition, Thompson will also 
install a voice recorder on each board 
to let surfers comment. These two per-
formance measures will be correlated 
with the velocities and accelerations of 
the board, which will be determined 
by about 50 flow sensors and mecha-
nisms, which includes accelerometers 
and gyroscopes, attached to the board.  

These fingernail-sized sensors, 
developed engineering undergradu-

ates last quarter, measure how quick-
ly the board moves over the water.

After the surfer has completed his 
run, he will be interviewed about the 
test and data from the sensor will be 
matched up with specific points, like 
how polygraph administrators match 
up lies told with spikes in a chart.

If there are consistent correlations 
between the interviews and data, 
the team can create performance 
markers and classify the boards that 
achieve those states as more superior. 
Thompson’s research will be the first 
time scientists have gathered data on 
the physics of surfboards.

If the data allows the team to 
calculate an optimal flexibility, 
Thompson will investigate if the opti-
mum is close to what manufacturers 
are producing now, then investigate 
the optimum flex for different types 
of riders based on variables such as 
body size. Thompson, who began his 
research in January, will have results 
coming out on a monthly basis until 
he completes his PhD. 

Thompson is also working on 

another method of matching surfers 
with a site called BoardFormula, which 
aggregates data sets about surfers and 
their surfboards. Using this data as a 
reference point, skill and a number of 
other factors, the website matches surf-
ers with their perfect surfboard.

“It’s like the Match.com of surf-
boards,” Thompson said. “And 
believe me, a lot of surfers are more 
interested in finding their soul surf-
board than their soul mate.”

Students preparing for the beginning of yet 
another school year may have a new reason to 
start the stressing early: The full 32-percent fee 
increase instituted by the UC Board of Regents 
last fall has finally taken place. Tuition at each UC 
campus increased by $1,929 beginning this fall 
quarter  — from $8,373 to $10,302 — so  instead 
of last year’s fees of $25,515 per quarter, students 
will now be paying $27,85.

The fee increase was instituted last November 
by a near-unanimous vote when the Board of 
Regents chose to increase tuition fees to cover 
a decrease in state funding caused by revenue 
decline, population growth, court litigations and 
ineffective budget solutions.

While public agencies and institutions in 
California await the final state budget — currently 
breaking the record for going 85 days without 
approval due to conflicts over how to close the 
$19-billion deficit — UCSD is changing the way it 
allocates money. Currently, 11 percent of UCSD’s 
funds comes from the state.

“Our own budget process and most of the 
other campuses have been held up waiting for 
the state. It doesn’t mean that there’s no funds,” 
UCSD Campus Budget Office Assistant Budget 
Director Blair Stephenson said. “We’ve made plans 
to accommodate what we think the budget’s going 
to be but there is no state budget so we’re being 
very cautious about how we spend our funds right 
now.”

Of UCSD’s total funds, 89 percent come from 
existing resources carried over from the previous 
year in addition to sources, such as hospital revenue, 
federal grants, fundraising efforts and student fees.

“The student fee increases generate revenue 
for the campus and it’s unfortunate that we’ve 
had these fee increases in the last couple of years,” 
Stephenson said. “But the fee increases have helped 
to mitigate some of the state budget reductions.”

Stephenson said the lack of progress in approv-
ing the state budget has reduced the UC system’s 
budget and caused the state to not pay for the cost 
increases the UC system is experiencing, such as 
inflationary costs, health benefit costs and contri-
butions made to the retirement system.

“Last year, the state reductions to the campus 
were very, very severe. We’re not expecting further 

state reductions. However the state is not funding 
a lot of mandatory cost increases to the campus,” 
Stephenson said.

The campus has been responding to the state 
fiscal crisis by restructuring organizations, con-
solidating services and cutting back cost.

For example, last year UCSD instituted hir-
ing freezes, furloughs, eliminated positions, con-
solidation of the vice chancellor positions for 
External Affairs, Business Affairs and restructur-
ing of information technology services.

“The biggest savings you’re going to see on 
a campus like this [and also] the biggest cost we 
gave, is people,” Stephenson said. “And the only 
way to cut back on salaries and expenses is to cut 
back on people. We try to minimize the impact by 
going through a hiring freeze.”

The budget office is looking into additional 
ways to bring in revenue through federal stimu-
lus money and grant money. It is also planning 
to increase the number of out-of-state students 
to bring in more fee revenue to subsequently 
increase the number of faculty members.

“[Enrolling] non-resident students is not at the 
expense of decreasing other student enrollment,” 
Stephenson said. “It’s just additive, so it doesn’t 
impact our resident student population.”

The basic expenses for non-California residents 
total about $50,737 per year, which brings in $22,879 
more than California residents for the university.

Stephenson said UCSD remains hopeful for 
increased funding, especially in light of a state 
budget proposed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
that focuses on higher education, which promises 
to restore $305 million cut last year and add $51.3 
million in financial aid toward eligible students 
who are not currently being funded.

“What our future outlook looks like is a little 
bit unknown right now,” Stephenson said. “We are 
hopeful that legislature will pass the budget soon. 
We are hopeful everything that was in the gover-
nor’s budget will be supported by the legislature.”

On the campuswide level, UC spokesperson 
Peter King said in an e-mail about how the UC 
system is adjusting to the budget impasse.

“We are working hard on our end to make sure 
we eliminate any possible waste and to make sure 
we are as creative as possible in a relentless effort 
to make every dollar count,” he said.

cerns a virtual sit-in targeting the UC 
Office of the President website on last 
year’s March 4 Day of Action. 

The 400 participants involved 
overloaded the website with excessive 
hits, causing the website to crash and 
display 404 error messages such as 
“There is no transparency found at the 
UC Office of the President.”

“What is unusual about it is that 
none of the artists involved were ever 
notified that the investigation had 
been concluded,” Dominguez said.

Dominguez and his legal team 
met with Senior Vice Chancellor 
of Academic Affairs Paul Drake on 
September 15 to discuss the virtual 
sit-in investigation. Drake presented 
Dominguez with a document to settle 
the investigation, which Dominguez’s 
legal team is currently reviewing.

“In our meeting, what we tried to 
make clear is that we were certainly 
willing to negotiate a positive out-
come of the virtual sit-in performance 
[on] March 4, 2010,” Dominguez said. 
“But, it was very difficult to make a 
clear reading of the document which 
we had not seen up until that point. 
It seemed to me to be a rather broad 
document that I had personal issues 
with in terms of definitions. Whether 
or not that was the intent or not, some 
of the broadness of the language made 
me question the certain limits.”

While such a document would the-
oretically bring the investigation to a 
close and stabilize Dominguez’s UCSD 
tenure, Dominguez fears it would also 
limit some of the art and work he was 
hired to perform.

Dominguez’s background involved 
partnering with the Zapatista Army 

of National Liberation — libertarians 
living in a declared state of war against 
Mexico by using nonviolent ways like 
the Internet to spread their messages. 
His partnering led up to his 1998 
invention of an online activist tool 
called the virtual sit-in, which was used 
to spread rumors about UC President 
Mark G. Yudof’s resignation.

“Part of it, at least it seems to me, 
would limit the very work that I was 
hired to practice in the past and the 
present,” Dominguez said. “It is sort of 
equivalent to saying you’re a painter, 
but we sort of request that you no 
longer paint.”

Dominguez plans to next meet 
with Drake again on September 23 to 
further discuss the document.

money left over from the amount ini-
tially allocated to materials and labor. 

The next-largest financial contri-
bution for construction, totaling about 
$188 million, comes from monetary 
gifts given to the university by philan-
thropists and wealthy families. 

According to Cara, $75 million of 
this money was donated by the Jacobs 
family — the namesakes of the Jacobs 
School of Engineering, who also con-
tributed $75 million last year toward 
a new UCSD hospital that is now in 
the planning stages.

State and federal grant money, 
as well as grants from institutions 
and private investment, account for 
the remaining costs. Out of the total 
costs, only 0.1 percent, which is about 
$2.2 million, comes from student reg-
istration fees.

The only construction being fund-
ed by student registration fees is the 
Dana Recreation Field on top of a new 
parking structure on East Campus, 
near Preuss School and Thornton 
Hospital. Student registration fees are 
funding this field, which is slated for 
completion Fall 2010, because it will 
be primarily for student use.

Four of the 16 projects are for stu-
dent housing.  Expansions are being 
added to both the Muir College and 
Revelle College apartments, while The 
Village at Torrey Pines East is also 
under construction, to match Torrey 
Pines West, which opened in 2009. 
When finished, Torrey Pines East will 
house approximately 800 upperclass-
men when it opens in Spring 2011. 

The Muir College expansion will 
house about 275 undergraduate stu-
dents, and the Revelle expansion will 
house approximately 510 second-
year and upper-division undergradu-
ate students. In addition, the Rita 
Atkinson Residences are being con-

structed on the School of Medicine 
campus to house graduate and pro-
fessional students.

The additional housing is part of 
the UC Office of the President initia-
tive to reduce the number of com-
muter students.

“The goal is to have around 50 
percent of UCSD students housed 
on campus in the near future, which 
will require a lot of construction,” 
Cara said.

Seven of the projects are for the 
Thornton Hospital, Hillcrest Hospital 
or School of Medicine. Thornton 
Hospital will receive a new cardio-
vascular center, while buildings in the 
Hillcrest Hospital will receive earth-
quake improvements. The School of 
Medicine is receiving new education-
al facilities and a new office building. 
A large parking structure consisting 
of two buildings with about 1,200 
new spaces is also being added near 
Thornton Hospital.

A new five-story building for 
the Rady School of Management 
will have new classrooms, research 
laboratories, offices and an audito-
rium. In addition, a new structural 
engineering building is being added 
and various parts of the campus are 
scheduled to receive $73 million in 
upgraded utilities and infrastructure 
to reduce the campus’ overall energy 
consumption. 

The upgrades include heating and 
air conditioning retrofitting, more 
energy-efficient lighting and ther-
mostats, as well as replacement appli-
ances, like fumehoods and freezers, 
which use less electricity. Each of the 
projects is prioritized according to a 
statewide plan, but the upgrades are 
expected to be finished around 2013.

been viewed as a last resort.
“A referendum is simply a piece 

of legislation that says every single 
student must pay for this one service, 
or this one program, regardless of how 
many people use it,” Powers said. “The 
referendum was supposed to add $1.5 
million to $3 million to the budget 
because that’s how much is needed.”

Although the referendum would 
generate enough revenue to correct 
the deficit, A.S. Council has previously 
turned down the referendum in hopes 
that TPS will look outside of student 
fees for solutions. 

The council’s proposals include 
charging higher rates for parking cita-
tions, making departments pay for 
their own shuttle routes and increas-
ing the cost of visitor parking per-
mits. Councilmembers did, however, 
acknowledge the fact that a referen-

dum may be the only viable choice 
even after cutting from all other areas.

“A referendum has to come from stu-
dents,” Powers said. “Specifically, it has to 
come from A.S. and be voted on by A.S. 
before it could be voted on by students.”

Powers said that if a referendum is 
unsuccessful and weekend parking is 
left untouched, the extra revenue would 
either come from increasing parking 
permit fees — which he believes may 
no longer generate sustainable revenue  
— or cutting shuttle services.

“Parking is funding the transporta-
tion system because the transportation 
system is free for students.” Powers said.

Currently, the university fully funds 
all shuttle and public transportation 
services, which cost the school $6.9 
million during the 2007-2008.

“The problem is public trans-
portation is costing much more now 
because we’ve been wildly successful 

in attaining our goals,” d’Autremont 
said. “It’s a free bus for you as a student 
to get on it, but that doesn’t mean the 
university doesn’t pay.”

D’Autremont said he plans to set 
up a number of open forums where 
students can voice their opinions.

“We’d encourage people to come 
and have their opinions expressed,” 
d’Autremont said.

The next TPC meeting will take 
place this November and will discuss the 
changes within transportation in detail.

“We’re trying to figure out what we 
could possibly do,” d’Autremont said. 
“We’re trying to work with everybody, 
but eventually the bill becomes due.”

Don’t Worry, 
I’ll Sleep 
When I’m 
Dead
Last spring, after hazily stum-bling out of my last final dazed and confused with a serious Red 
Bull hangover, I was more than ready 
for summer. I had serious plans to hit 
the beach by day, party by night, and 
become very friendly with the La Jolla 
P.D. — just kidding, maybe. 

By the end of the summer I had 
made it to the beach a grand total 
of one time, thankfully the LJPD 
still have no idea who I am and if by 
“party,” you mean watching a com-
bination of the Food Network and 
Comedy Central until 4 a.m., then I 
definitely “partied” hard. 

As the school year loomed closer 
and closer, I realized that going to bed 
at 4 a.m. and sleeping until 1 p.m. the 
next afternoon just wasn’t going to 
fly anymore. I was no longer a fresh-
man. It was time to grow up. Maybe I 
didn’t have to buy a briefcase or wear a 
power suit to work just yet, but mature 
adults have to at least be up in time for 
the McDonald’s breakfast menu. Thus 
began my long and arduous crusade to 
go to bed by 9 p.m.

Unfortunately, move-in day wasn’t 
the best choice to wage this particular 
war. After unpacking box after box of 
clothes, old posters and my childhood 
teddy bears — shut up, yes, they still 
sleep in my bed — from my tiny, two-
door roadster, I wasn’t able to crawl 
into bed until 2 a.m. 

The next night I was determined to 
hit the hay by 9 p.m., and this time I was 
more successful — barely. After a visit 
to the AT&T store, my roommate and I 
received some of the worst news college 
students could hear: there weren’t any 
technicians available to install Internet 
until the following Wednesday. With no 
Facebook, e-mail, or access to Nic Cage 
films via Netflix, I had nothing to do 
but call it an early night — though I still 
found ways to postpone my date with 
Sandman until 11:30 p.m.

At 9 a.m. the next morning I joined 
my friends in fliering on Library Walk. 
And while my friends were groggy 
after a late night of debauchery — and 
Internet — for once I hadn’t forced 
myself out of bed at the last possible 
moment, clinging desperately to what 
extra minutes of sleep I could catch. It 
was a wonderful change to be able to 
cook breakfast (using the word “cook” 
loosely), straighten my hair, and jam out 
to Tay-Swift before heading out the door. 

That night was the closest to 9 p.m. 
I would get over the course of the next 
two weeks. 

I tried. I really did. 
On those rare nights when my 

head managed to hit the pillow before 
2 a.m., all I could do was toss and turn 
and wonder how so many bros could 
possibly live in my apartment complex 
and want to race shopping carts up 
and down the street at 1:30 a.m.

Despite the one morning of waking 
up refreshed to the welcome sound of 
birds chirping, I’ve accepted that I’m 
19 — not 90 — and I might as well 
take advantage of the years standing 
between me and a Denny’s senior 
early-bird special. And while I value 
sleep as much as the next overbooked-
over caffeinated-college student, I 
wouldn’t trade in late-night reruns of 
the Biggest Loser for anything.

A Change of 
Pace

EDiTORiAL

It’s happened, folks. The administra-tion is making yet another decision that will affect student life — and, 
more importantly, student pocketbooks 
— but this time, they’re waiting on your 
input.

Now that Transportation and Parking 
Services Director Brian d’Autremont has 
A.S. Council to blame for the failure of 
last year’s Transportation Referendum — 
which would have made every student 
shell out $25 this year to float our sink-
ing shuttles — and a thumbs-up from 
the Transportation Policy Committee 
on the parking permit fee increases, he 
has no conceivable reason to dilly dally. 
Why wait when you can dig yourself out 
of debt today? Yet, he has postponed the 
increase for an entire summer, ostensibly 
so that he can wait for student input.

This is our chance.
Administration and A.S. Council 

alike make a lot of noise about approach-
ing students for their input, but rarely 
has there been any evidence to suggest 
that they’re acting on it. The fact that the 
TPC is twiddling its thumbs while wait-
ing for students to get to campus offers 
the tenuous hope that maybe, this time, 
it’s for real.

Don’t play with our heart, TPC — you 
know we’ve been hurt before.

Of course, students have a notorious 
track record of doing absolutely noth-
ing, even when the decision in question 
makes a drastic impact on their lives. 
Or, worse, a cause picks up a number of 
ardent supporters, who then quietly drop 
the ball when it comes to the follow-
through (Cancer Cluster protesters of 
rallies past, we’re looking at you).

For anyone who was paying any kind 
of attention to last year’s protests — even 
those who limited themselves to vaguely 

disgruntled glances when forced to 
reroute their habitual walk to Center Hall 
— we’re going to run a line by you to see 
if it rings any bells:

“I see hurt. I see disempowerment. I 
see anger. Things border on hate speech 
and hate crime, and we are the voices of 
resistance.”

Sound familiar? It should — if you 
were a student here five years ago, when 
the chair of the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee said the above at a 
2005 rally protesting against an oppres-
sive campus climate and, shocker, the 
Koala. If you’re not rocking your 18th 
quarter as a sixth-year senior, however, 
that rhetoric probably sounded brand-
new when shouted across the quad in 
reaction to last year’s Compton Cookout 
and subsequent brouhaha.

The determining factor in whether 
last spring’s show of strength and solidar-
ity actually carries over into a reality this 
year — or follows its predecessor’s foot-
steps into the dusty pages of undisturbed 
archive rooms — is if students can 
remember to pay attention after the fact.

Too often does an issue get sidelined 
by finals or a quarter break, also known 
as a student-interest death knell. Library 
Walk was whipped into an epic frenzy 
by the events surrounding the Compton 
Cookout, but the second those organic 
chemistry finals reared their ugly heads, 
the campus fell eerily silent. Protesters 
retreated to their textbooks, bystanders 
once again.

The fact that students are so easily 
distracted allows things like last May’s 
increase in mandatory dining dollars to 
slip under the radar. On-campus students 
this are now, on average, forking out an

extra $87 a year for their meal plans, 
and only a handful of college coun-
cil members can tell you why. 

Though the dining dollar 
increase is over and done with, 
many of the other issues that came 
into the public consciousness at the 
tail end of last year will no doubt 
continue their saga into 2011.

The death of the Transportation 
Referendum is coming back to 
haunt us in the form of higher 
costs for parking permits and 
weekend parking fees, unless 
A.S. Council and Parking and 
Transportation Services agree to 
head to couples’ therapy and give 
their unlikely marriage another 
shot. The Israel-Palestinian argu-
ment (culminating in the “UCSD 
Divestment for Peace” bill) takes 
place like clockwork each spring, 
when Tritons for Israel and 
Students for Justice in Palestine 
each put their respective fund-
ing to use in broadcasting their 
unapologetic — and conflicting 

— messages. 
The Kumeyaay remains have yet 

to be repatriated, and even though 
the Grove has gone the way of the 
dodo, you can bet your finest fair-
trade coffee that the co-operatives 
are going to make some noise over 
their rent re-negotiation this year.

Most controversially, the Black 
Student Union’s list of 32 demands 
— which include more faculty of 
color, an increase in S.P.A.C.E.S. 
funding, and almost Biblical levels 
of outreach — will either fizzle or 
flourish, depending on whether stu-
dents remember to hold the admin-
istration to last year’s promises. And 
let’s not forget that media funding 
might also get a second chance in 
the limelight, as the Koala is honor-
bound to do something degenerate 
at first opportunity.

The danger lies in letting these 
issues slide in favor of the immedi-
ate crisis of an anthropology paper. 
The classic problem of any uni-
versity is the lack of institutional 
memory; with all of us gone in a 

quick four years, anything that hap-
pened before might as well not have 
existed. 

D’Autremont is handing out the 
first opportunity of Fall Quarter to 
break the cycle. Instead of following 
the silent footsteps of last year (and 
the year before...and the year before 
that), students need to take the time 
to make their voices heard on issues 
that affect them in the day-to-day. 
Let the man know that you value 
your Arriba shuttle stop, your free 
weekend parking, or the extra $25 in 
your wallet that you intend to blow 
on a new pair of shoes.

Sending one e-mail isn’t much, 
but it’s a start; paying attention to 
a cause where the administration 
seems willing to actually listen to 
students can open the door to all 
kinds of future communication. 
More importantly, it could be the 
start of people remembering to 
keep their eyes on the develop-
ments taking place around them, 
instead of starting each Fall 
Quarter from scratch.

drAwing fire By Johan DeLaTorre
 

Dear Editor,
As a second year at UCSD, I think 

about my freshman year and can’t 
help but wonder what difference it 
would have made if I skipped that 
late night party, wouldn’t have gone 
home every other weekend, not 
joined a sorority… etc. Every choice 
has a unique outcome. Even though 
I made some that I regret, there 
are many more that I would never 
change. As freshmen in huge campus 
universities such as UCSD, many 
students feel they have a chance for a 
fresh start. My first year at UCSD was 
trying out my new-found freedom, 
making errors and learning from my 
experiences. What I would change 
are the sleepless nights trying to fin-
ish essays due the next morning — I 
passed, but barely! I would also not 
go back home as often, since it was 
getting in the way of concentrating 
on important assignments. As there 
are some things I would change, 
there are more I would never regret, 
such as getting involved in organiza-
tions that helped me expand socially 
and offered support. It’s important 
that new students get involved in the 
campus community in order to adjust 
to the new environment and not feel 
alone in a new place. As new students 
enter, they will see that there is so 
much being offered that it doesn’t 
hurt to look into different organiza-
tions and clubs to see what is best for 
them. I found that joining a sorority 
was the best for me, but explore all 
options available and see what suits 
you best. I wish somebody would 
have given me this advice earlier, 
making my first year easier and more 
error-free, however, I guess that is 
just part of the college experience. As 
a first year, be curious, not afraid of 
getting involved, meeting new people, 
don’t procrastinate and study (real 
studying). But most significantly, the 
confidence to thrive in a university 
environment.

Dear Editor,  
While I’m glad to be back home 

at UCSD, it only took a few minutes 
to be reminded of my least favorite 
part of campus: Library Walk. It 
is often a dicey place to walk, but 
never is there a time when student 
organizations are more vicious and 
frothing at the mouth than Welcome 
Week, shoving neon-colored fliers 
into your hands. No, I do not want 
to join your fraternity. No, I do not 
want to join your Asian Christian 
club (and you should realize that by 
my skin color). I have headphones 
on and neither of my hands free, yet 
you’re still yelling at me and pelting 
me with lollipops.

Is there really no better way to 
promote your club than to bully 
some wide-eyed freshmen into sign-
ing up for your listserv by throwing 
a clipboard at them? I’ve tabled 
for organizations. I know how the 
system works, and guess what? If 
you have a sign that stands out on 
your table with your club’s name, 
interested people will still come 
over, talk to you and sign up. Maybe 
spend a few dollars of your club 
funds for candy, pens or something 
else to give out to get attention. Just 
let me walk down Library Walk in 
peace for once without having to 
stop to throw away all your fliers 
in the trashcans in front of Geisel. 
Unless, of course, you have free 
food ... then I’m all yours.

INTERNATIONAL WALK, ERC

www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG/FOCUS

It’s a Saturday night and a week before the start of school — 11 weeks before the dreaded promise of finals — but Thurgood Marshall sophomore Jennifer 
Taylor* wants to secure her Adderall (also known as 
amphetamine-dextroamphetamine) supply before cart-
loads of anxiety-ridden college students flock to her 
already overdrawn supplier, jacking up prices. A smart 
and economical move — if you ignore the legality of the 
issue.

Adderall is classified as a stimulant or a drug that tem-
porarily improves brain function in regards to memory 
and focus. When taken two to three times daily as pre-
scribed, Adderall should allow patients to control previ-
ously erratic actions.

Normally, Adderall is used to treat those who suffer 
from Attention Deficient Disorder (ADD), Attention 
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. 
A less lawful and more frowned-upon use is as a main 

ingredient in a Lohan-esque amphetamine binge and a 
mechanism for rapid weight loss. College students, how-
ever, seem to have adopted a different take.

“Your brain moves faster. I’m able to think faster — to 
read faster,”  Taylor said. “What would take me an hour 
to read might take me half an hour to read. You’re really 
focused on what you’re doing.”

THE HYPE
Taylor isn’t alone — originally the collegiate dark 

horse in comparison to drugs like alcohol and marijuana, 
Adderall use among adults has been steadily increas-
ing over the past decade, and usage has almost doubled 
since the year 2000, according to data recently released 
by Medco Health Solutions. This study drug has a wide 
basis of appeal. It’s relatively inexpensive: Pills range from 
$3 each to a high of $10 or $15, depending on how close 
midterms or finals are.

Bryan Marks*, a Muir College sophomore, obtains 
most of his Adderall from friends who have prescrip-
tions, or friends of friends with prescriptions. In turn, 
Marks shares the powdered love by providing Adderall to 
friends without similar means — at an inflated price, of 
course. It trickles down the distribution chain: The pre-
scription holder (usually oblivious of the value of the tiny 
blue pills) offloads his Adderall for a trivial amount (read: 
nickels and dimes); the purchaser then ups the price to a 
full bill as the next guy charges a $5. Marks even admits 
to upping Adderall prices to ridiculous amounts during 
finals season to score a larger profit. Everyone wins — 
except the consumer.

“I have more friends who abuse Adderall rather than 
take it,” Marks said. “Essentially, they aren’t taking it 
because they suffer from ADHD.”

10 THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAy, SEpTEmbER 23, 2010 FOCUS

A mere 25 minutes away from campus lies an NRA-
lover’s wet dream, sitting inconspicuously off Highway 76 
toward Oceanside. The Iron Sights Shooting Range offers 
a laid-back atmosphere and chance to spend an afternoon 
engaging in one of America’s favorite hardcore pastimes: 
shooting big-ass guns at things and feeling like a baller for as 
cheap as $12, if you have your own guns and ammunition.

As a newbie to the world of weaponry, I took a few 
friends for moral support when I visited the range, but the 
guys behind the counter quickly put us at ease by relent-
lessly cracking jokes. Still, they clearly knew their shit. 
After noticing that I was documenting the experience with 
iPhone pictures, an employee named Larry told me to put 
the phone away until we got into the shooting lanes and 
warned me that he wouldn’t hesitate to fight a woman who 
tried to “case his joint.”

Before I could summon up the cop-action movie refer-
ences necessary to figure out what the hell he was talking 
about, I was asked to select my weapon of choice from 
the endless rows of seemingly identical guns. I arbitrarily 
picked the 9mm X-Five Competition, thinking that it 
looked basic yet BAMF enough, while my friend went with 
a menacing shotgun, the Remington 870. 

As someone who’s never held a gun before in my life, 
the informality of the process was slightly unsettling. After 

filling out a short questionnaire in which I confirmed that 
I had never been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor, 
had never been diagnosed with a mental illness and wasn’t 
addicted to drugs or alcohol (because hey, it’s not alcohol-
ism until you graduate), I suddenly found myself standing 
in a room full of people, a live and fully loaded weapon sur-
really resting in my sweaty palm. 

We ditched the generic targets circle-shaped targets, 
opting instead for posters depicting a cartoonish zombie 
and a blown-up photograph of “Wifebeater Chuck”   — a 
sneering, mullet-sporting thug pointing his glock straight 
for your face and wearing (you guessed it) a wifebeater.

“Hold the gun like this with your right hand,” Larry 
demonstrated, calmly. “Then wrap your left hand around 
it like this. Don’t do it like this, or else you’ll blow your 
thumb off.”

Next thing I knew, I had my protective head and eye gear 
on and was headed straight for the 24-lane indoor shooting 
range. We were assigned to lane six, hung up our target 
and loaded our guns. Larry handed over our ammunition 
— 125 bullets total between the three of us. Time to shoot 
some bitches. 

Before coming to the range I had envisioned being bare-
ly able to restrain myself from running around in circles, 
recklessly shooting into the air and screaming “Yippiekayay, 
motherfuckers!” at the top of my lungs, but now that I actu-
ally had the cold steel in my hands, all I wanted to do was 
make it out of the building with both my thumbs intact. Yet, 
after unloading the first round of bullets on my 9mm — and 
having a fair amount actually impale Wifebeater Chuck — I 
relaxed a little and started enjoying myself.

Then came the fun part — time to shoot the rifle. Word 
to the wise: Shooting rifles is fun, but for the love of God, 
lean into the damn thing and place all your weight against 
it before you pull the trigger, or the gun will shoot back 
into your shoulder and leave you bruised for days. Despite 
the pain, I’d say spraying the targets with enough bullets to 
take down a whole army of zombies was the highlight of 
the experience.

As my adventure came to a close and I walked back out 
to the shop and removed my headphones, Larry glanced up 
at my poker-red ears.

“The police say that’s the sign of a true methhead. … So 
next time you score [some meth], come on over here and 
we’ll have some real fun.” 

Though the whole experience turned out to be pricier 
than expected — $86 to rent guns, ammunition and shoot-
ing time for three people — it was a pretty badass and excit-
ing way to spend a weekend afternoon, and something tells 
me that I’ll be back for more.

So what’s with the excessive pill popping? 
“They take it because they’re studying. The 
people who take Adderall and party are 
... I don’t know too many people who use 
amphetamines as a foundation for their 
drinking.”

READING BETWEEN THE LINES
Adderall (and its extended-release sibling, 

Adderall XR) comes saddled with a weighty 
list of side effects: Many self-described “hon-
est” students are outraged at the advantage 
Adderall users are given in the classroom set-
ting, assigning Adderall users an undesirable 
social stigma. Selling Adderall is considered 
a felony that can earn you a $10,000 fine and 
up to 45 years in prison.

Additionally, the U.S. National Library 
of Medicine warns consumers that Adderall 
is known to induce nervousness, headaches, 
stomach pain and nausea. In some cases, an 
overdose could prove fatal, which will defi-
nitely put a downer on your upper.

Not that such ominous warnings come 
as a surprise for Adderall consumers, or 
even act as a proper deterrent — an alarm-
ing number of more common prescription 
drugs like Xanax and Prozac have been 
known to cause fatalities when consumed 
by less-than-healthy or undiscerning 
patients. Addiction and dependency is the 
more pressing concern for the average user 
who — according to psychiatry professor 
Marc Schuckit — may find himself experi-
encing heightened paranoia and aggression 
as he ups dosage for increased effect.  

“If I take a high dose of Adderall or a 
high dose of speed on the street, I can die 
exactly the same way, with convulsions and 
cardiac arrhythmias,” Schuckit said. “If I take 
regular doses for a high of Adderall or regu-
lar doses for a high of amphetamine I might 
buy on the street, I am likely to become 
very paranoid, believing people are trying 
to harm me and maybe hearing voices. It’s 
temporary — it will go away, but you can be 
pretty impaired while it’s there.”

Adderall, Schuckit explained, is a legal-

ized version of speed, sort of. It’s not the drug 
itself that’s illegal, it’s the way people take it. 
Both are amphetamines — which can be 
disastrous in large quantities, regardless of 
whether you suffer from ADD or not. But 
what about when students take Adderall in 
measured, low doses? “I can’t help anymore, 
I’m sorry,” Schuckit replies.

Nancy Downs, an associate physician 
diplomat in UCSD’s psychiatry department, 
agreed that using Adderall at varying fre-
quencies without being prescribed — in 
other words, the college user who wants it 
for an edge on finals — is harmful.

Downs explained that stimulants could 
cause cardiac Small Vessel Disease, when 
a user’s small vessels — the arterioles — 
get clogged through repeated stimulant use. 
Cardiac Small Vessel Disease can lead to a 
heart attack or result in acute chest pain. 
This condition is most common in cocaine 
users, Downs said, adding that she’s opting 
to discuss the effect of stimulants on users 
in very general terms rather than being 
Adderall-specific.

“Yes, stimulants do improve performance 
in healthy control subjects, unless they have 
one of underlying risk factors [such as anxi-
ety], in which case it wouldn’t improve per-
formance,” Downs said, “Absolutely. That’s 
why caffeine is so popular.”

Jaime Pineda, an associate professor of 
cognitive science, explained how Adderall 
functions: “Amphetamine causes neu-
rotransmitter systems such as dopamine, 
norepinephrine and other biogenic amines 
to be released at the synapses.” In layman’s 
terms, Adderall — like cocaine and caffeine 
— targets the mesolimbic reward pathway 
and makes people feel good. And feeling 
good can be addicting.

There is some good news for Adderall 
users: According to the New York Times, 
Adderall is far less dangerous than cous-
in-drugs cocaine and methamphetamine. 
Additionally, the Times reports that Shire 
Pharmaceuticals Group, the makers of 
Adderall, have conducted medical research 
and deduced that the drug has no poten-

tial for addiction 
(though other 
studies have sug-
gested otherwise). 
By no means is it 
risk free, but a 
relatively sunny 

70 years of Adderall use by the general pub-
lic indicates the drug’s unique dichotomous 
position as a study drug may be due, at least 
in part, to social stigma and moral disap-
proval rather than health implications.

THE COMEDOWN
Adderall hasn’t given Taylor any of 

Adderall’s notorious side effects of para-
noia or isolation. When asked, during our 
now extensive walk, Taylor deadpanned. 
No. Of course she wasn’t hallucinating or 
feeling paranoid.

However, right before reaching her 
supplier’s door she reluctantly admitted, 
“I don’t feel comfortable going into a 
final without it. My grades are so much 
better now.” And with the drug’s identity 
in eternal limbo, who is to say cultural 
acceptance isn’t palpable? Everything in 
moderation.

With that, she turned the doorknob 
and walked through the doorway.

Adderall: Abuse, Use and Riding the High 
▶ ADDERALL, from page 9

Before I left to study abroad in Barcelona, everyone 
from my mom to my hairdresser Greg shared one com-
mon premonition: I was, without question, going to have 
the time of my life. The history, the tapas, the hombres — 
“oh,” Greg insisted, “the hombres!” — what a ball I’d have.

After promising to Skype often and smuggle soccer 
players in my suitcase come Christmas, I packed my room 
in milk crates and trash bags, and was gone.

Except the first few days didn’t quite turn out as 
planned. I wasn’t greeted at the terminal by a troop of 
World Cup champs. No charming caballero spared me the 
embarrassment of lugging a colossal orange suitcase down 
Barcelona’s ritziest street, hunched to the ground and 
sweating tears due to a broken handle. My first memories 
of tapas will forever reek of loneliness and jet-lag.

But best of all, I arrived homeless.

My first challenge in the city that sleeps in the middle of 
the afternoon was to find longer-term lodging other than 
the hostel bunk I had reserved prior to my departure. I’d 
tried in vain to track down an apartment on Craigslist in 
the weeks before I left, but the prospects of committing to 
live with strangers — and sending two months’ rent to an 
unknown across the Atlantic Ocean — were both pretty 
bleak.

And so I searched. And my bunkmate, Frank, a German 
exchange student who’d gotten in the day before with 
equally negligible planning and Spanish comprehension 
skills, searched with me. We scoured the local equivalent 
to Craigslist — a site called Loquo.com — employing such 
advanced search terms as “estudiante,” “chicos” (which, 
apparently, is seldom listed without being qualified by 
“gay”) and, in more desperate moments, “English,” to track 
somewhere to hang our respective hats.

Frank suggested early on that we visit some of the rooms 
together, which was fine by me. Our first stop: the apart-
ment of a 29-year-old artist and teacher whose name eluded 
us. After being buzzed in and ascending the ill-lit staircase, 
though, we were taken by surprise: Anna (or Carla or Maria, 
but let’s stick with Anna), bless her soul, had long since 
waved her 20s a careless, cigarette-wielding goodbye.

Ignoring our feeble attempts at textbook-Spanish 
pleasantries, the woman stood at the entrance confused: 
There was only one room, but two of us. Thankfully, 
because “amigo” remains within the narrow bounds of my 
vocabulary, I was able to explain that I was only there as a 
friend. Not para mí.

Once the basics were settled, Anna told us to take a 
seat on the couch in her office. She rattled off the perti-
nent details in a weary, practiced monotone: no smoking, 
no fiestas, no loud music (especially not on Sunday), no 
guests unless they’re paying 15 Euros a night. Questions? 
No questions. Vamos.

The room itself was nothing remarkable. The flowery 
bedspread might not have suited Frank’s Teutonic sen-
sibilities, and the lighting probably couldn’t have held a 
candle to Lindsay Lohan’s prison bungalow, but it certainly 
could have sufficed for a few months. Except, somehow, 
Anna’s insistence on padlocking the bedroom doors sort of 
eliminated any sense of rustic homeliness. And safety. We 
politely admired the washing machine and were on our way.

The next 72 hours of my life tell a story replete with 
confusion, heartbreak and occasionally indecent hallway 
ornamentation. Appraising a stranger’s home and sheep-
ishly asking about their level of substance abuse is an 
awkward enough proposition at home, but with a second-
grader’s vocabulary? It’s a lot worse. I promise.

Plus, the prospective housemates I’d met a couple 
nights before — ones who were the stuff of my study-
abroad fantasy, as they were all from different countries 
and shared gourmet dinners in the living room — had just 
passed on me, doubtless due to my contemptible silence 
and awkwardness. Could asking a little about someone’s 
tesis really be that hard? It is called a tesis, isn’t it?

Except it didn’t have to be so terrible. Sometime in the 
middle of the third day, I was [Frank had already found a 
place by then. Bastard.] struck by inspiration in the form 
of a good friend of mine from school. With the dreadful 
days of recruitment fast-approaching for her, I’d gathered 
a rudimentary understanding of sorority attraction: Stop 
eating, start smiling and maybe pretend you love going to 
Big Bear, too. In other words, small talk.

Sure, it’s hard to keep the cheer alive when you’re crav-
ing a torta, but it’s worth it when the new girls are pretty. 
And my new apartment needed to be pretty.

After this, I schmoozed with the best of them, language 
barrier be damned. I attentively commented on Nuria’s 
charming balcony and San Francisco mug (“There it is, 
and here I am — Funny!”). I asked Kenneth, the architect, 
about his extensive CD collection (but he didn’t have WiFi; 
automatic no-go).

By the time I finally made it to the actually-charming 
duplex that I’ll be calling home for the rest of the year, 
making Spanish small-talk was a breeze. Maybe it’s an 
elementary-school lesson only necessary for an artless sec-
ond grader, but it works for me: Showing a little genuine 
interest in someone is usually enough to land you right 
on your feet.

When Susy Bielak created the collection “Gestures with 
Flowers and Hands,” mixed media drawings of politicians 
shaking hands and offering flowers to allies, she focused on 
the symbolism of hands and the stories they tell through their 
actions. But this depiction of ceremonial handshakes and 
flower arrangements in dark charcoal grays and vibrant reds 
only foreshadowed the applause and congratulatory bouquets 
she was soon to receive.

In fact, on Sept. 2 —when the UCSD graduate was named 
New Artist of the Year by the San Diego Fine Art Society 
— the appreciation poured in. To commemorate the start 
of San Diego Art Month, the first annual Fine Arts Awards 
recognized notable local artists whose projects enrich the San 
Diego community. Winners were chosen via a public vote on 
the Society’s website. Bielak, one of four recipients, had her 

work showcased as part of a collection entitled “Here Not 
There,” at the La Jolla galleries of the San Diego Museum of 
Contemporary Art until Sept. 19.

     Born in Mexico City and raised in Pennsylvania, Bielak 
relocated to San Diego four years ago to pursue a masters 
degree in fine arts, which she received in 2009. Due to her 
diverse upbringing, Bielak said that “questions of hybrid iden-
tity and issues of space have long propelled my work.”

 Her artwork focuses on exposing the contrast between the 
personal and the social elements of society. For example, her 
series of monotypes entitled “Aerial Gaze” depicts people walk-
ing on a sidewalk as seen from a second story window.

 “The project offers the proximity to witness people inti-
mately and the distance to envision them as patterns,” she said.

Bielak frequently employs uncommon techniques to pro-

duce her artwork. One of her multimedia projects, entitled 
“Quake/Temblor,” uses old photos and seismographic records 
to portray the widespread effects of earthquakes on both the 
human and geographic levels. In the past she has applied 
sketchbook text and drawings onto bus doors, and drawn with 
water on opaque plastic to reference subtleties of memory.

 “My projects often incorporate nontraditional materials 
and processes in order to best render an idea,” she said.

 Bielak explained that her unconventional use of materials 
and her wide array of subjects make her work more relatable, 
and allow her to connect with her audience in myriad ways.

“I’m touched when the work strikes a chord with audience 
members—when my projects propel questions, inspire reflec-
tion, or invite people to see a social issue in a new way,” she 
said.

Bielak, now Associate Director of Art and Technology at 
Sixth College, credits UCSD’s research capability as one of the 
factors that aided her career.

“Having access to the resources and minds of this campus 
allowed me to take a huge leap forward in the scope of my 
work,” she said.

Bielak’s newest project is a work in progress that consists 
of drawings of materials taken from her kitchen cupboard and 
medicine cabinet, as well as engravings on kitchen tables.

“These experiments are exciting,” she says, as is “the pro-
cess” of creating the art itself.

But in both art and life, finding the right “process” to 
achieve a goal can be half the battle.

 “Figure out what you really want,” Bielak advised, “and 
keep pushing until you get it.”

TONIGHT

Imagine the scene: One chiseled real-ity star — the master of ceremonies — looms above the crowd of a dance 
tent, shouting, “Bein’ a guido is a way of 
life!” while you, self-obsessed student, 

in the midst of your Popov binge, gyrate 
amongst the sweaty masses, ignoring the 
hilarity of who is actually at the root of it 
all because irony doesn’t exist when you’re 
drunk, and Jersey Shore makes complete, 
total and undeniable sense. Fist pumping 
isn’t amusing — it’s serious business, and 
more satisfying than you could possibly 
understand.

This, my friends, is the solution to all 
our problems.

After budget cuts, racial tension, 
protests and entirely too much Drake at 
last year’s Sun God Festival, UCSD needs 
some serious help. Add a bad shut-in and 
study reputation and it’s obvious how 
much guidance is truly necessary. But 
we’re not totally lost! All our ill-spirited 
campus needs to start fresh is one event, 
one moment, to bring us back to con-
sciousness and out of our depressing 
slump. 

Which brings me back to my unbeliev-
able discovery. But first, let me tell you 
about my summer; it’s to blame for my 
life-altering epiphany. 

I mostly did nothing, but damn, it 
was the most glorious nothingness that 
anyone could possibly enjoy. I reveled in 
nothingness, rolled around in it, kicked 
its ass and then fell in love with it all over 
again. I became a pop culture connoisseur, 
devouring entertainment’s gourmet spe-
cials, along with its dollar menu. The high-
est highs and the lowest lows were equally 
at my disposal. I loved (and loathed) it all. 

I defended Teen Mom. I started quot-
ing Twin Peaks regularly. I read Perez 
Hilton. I learned to play a vuvuzela. I 
watched the first season of True Blood in 
one day flat. I began to mold my drink 
choices after Don Draper (Manhattan, 
please), and most importantly, I watched 
an uncomfortably large amount of 
Jersey Shore — the pantheon of Ke$ha-
dominated trash.  Through all of this, I 
became enlightened.

I may have been consuming cultural 
trash, but hell, I vomited up diamonds.

Through the culmination of my cul-
tural studies, through digesting both the 
savory and the torrid, I have stumbled 
upon the insight necessary to determine 
what UCSD needs. My remedy is the key 
that will unleash the good fortune that we 
have all been waiting for. 

While watching Jersey Shore last 
Thursday, it dawned on me: DJ Pauly 
D must play at Sun God. That’s it. The 
answer to the world’s problems. 

I know what you’re thinking: What 
would make one hilariously coiffed 
Italian–American DJ so special? Why 
would an orange guido be our savior?

Think about it: This could be the event 
that brings UCSD back to life. You can’t 
go downhill from Pauly D. You can’t leave 
such belligerent moments in the dust, you 
can only expand upon it. In a year’s time 
you’ll see. We’ll all be proponents of the 
GTL regimen, and ya know, we might just 
become better from it. 

Unlike most of our school’s population, 
Pauly D doesn’t care about an A on an 
organic chemistry midterm, he only cares 
about whether or not the girl in his bed 
is a grenade or not, and that’s a sentiment 
that UCSD could use a little more of. 

So help me out, guys. Let’s start the 
campaign: DJ Pauly D for Sun God. Don’t 
let this year become so stale.

Let the Facebook groups begin!

W e have a love–hate relation-ship with the Loft: They afford us the opportunity 
to see the blogosphere’s fantastic, 
lesser-known artists in a small, 
intimate setting, even if that set-
ting feels bourgy and sterile. Still, 

it’s irresistible. This year’s “Loft 
Off ” event — a self-described “live 
improvisation” — is no exception, 
packing the combined punch of 
San Diego-native DJ The Gaslamp 
Killer and an art installation. 
Pretentious much? Nonetheless, 

it’s a good model for our favorite 
hipster breeding ground, and The 
Gaslamp Killer’s interesting brand 
of electronica — full of left-field 
hip-hop beats, dub step overtones 
and a little bit of soul — certainly 
makes it worth the $5 admission.

M ichael Franti & Spearhead owe the breakthrough of their 16-year career to their infec-
tiously happy 2008 radio hit “Say 
Hey (I Love You),” and they certainly 
plan on sticking with the same chip-
per message on their new album, 
Sound of Sunshine. 

This upbeat title, however, has 
dark roots. The life-affirming album 
was written when Franti almost died 
from an appendix rupture. On his 
assumed deathbed, the composer 
poured out 11 songs about love, 
friendship and the beauty of life. 
Throw in some recording sessions 
in Jamaica and legendary producer 
Sly & Robbie — who worked with 
Bob Dylan, Santana and No Doubt 
— and The Sound of Sunshine feels 
predictably breezy, but not without 
substance.

Underneath the surface-level 
cheer are complex sounds that weave 
through the pulsating grooves of 
reggae and hip hop with the catchy 
hooks of  pop-rock. The album 
boasts variety, as songs range from 
the U2-esqe arena anthem “I’ll Be 
Waiting” to the ’70s hard rock hom-
age “The Thing That Helps Me Get 
Through.” The first single, “Shake 
It,” which also happens to be one of 
the album’s best tracks, is a reggae 
dancehall groove that features the 
impeccable flow of Jamacian reggae 
singer Lady Saw.

The lack of a cohesive sound 
sometimes detracts from the album’s 
identity, but Franti’s distinctively 
soulful voice — whether he is throw-
ing down verses or lightly humming 
melodies — is easily recognizable 
and helps to unify the album.

It’s hard not to enjoy Franti’s 
complex, uplifting music. Even if the 
sonic changes are often distracting 
and the persistent gaiety unoriginal, 
the tunes have an undeniable appeal; 
the biggest ice-queen could be 
thawed by the burn of Franti’s hon-
est and soulful message.  It’s just too 
damn happy to ignore.

AlbumREVIEW

F reshmen: If, after a week of name games, Un-Olympics and increas-ingly annoying roommates, you’re 
itching to join something “revolutionary,” 
it’s time you discover the underbelly of 
UCSD’s on-campus music scene. This 
weekend, Che Cafe is hosting its annual 
“Disorientation” — a festival chock-full 
of music, activities and vegan-approved 
food. There’s a circuit workshop, talks 
on veganism, bike maintenance and 
anarchist information for all your hippie 
needs.

On the music front, there’s a plethora 
of local artists, creating either the per-
fect introduction to the San Diego 
music scene or a great welcome back 
from a summer away. For the cutesy, 
there’s UCSD’s very own A Book About 
Elephants, a one girl show of Juno-style 
acoustic-pop. If the idea of tongue-in-
cheek electro-pop catches your fancy, 
then the sardonically named Endless 
Bummer might be your pick of the week-
end, too. 

On the second day there’s even more 
music by Colony and Bravo Miro (among 
others), as well as an art show by the 
Further Project, a collective of San Diego 
visual artists.

On both days the festivities begin at 3 
p.m., with the music beginning at 6 p.m. 
and running into the night. Events are 
free, except for the food (hey, veganism 
ain’t cheap). 

E verything is typically on the house during the first weeks of Fall Quarter: You’ve got free food, free alco-hol and plenty of free entertainment. But sometimes 
paying a loftier price is worth the investment, especially 
when it involves shelling out 40 bucks to see alternative-
rock legends play their magnum opus at RIMAC Arena. 
Yes, the Pixies are coming, and yes, they’re playing 1989’s 
Doolittle in its entirety — including B-sides. Make your 
way over to Eleanor Roosevelt College and fake the Gen X 
nostalgia you missed while in diapers.

A bout 10 minutes into “You Again,” the beautiful Joanna (Odette Yustman) turns — hair flowing, 
bathed in golden light, announced by 
an angel chorus — to face Marni Olson 
(Kristen Bell), and the 
premise of the movie 
becomes crystal clear: 
High school never 
ends. Not if you’re 
Marni, a one-time loser 
whose arch-nemesis 
has returned to marry 
her brother, hoodwink 
her family and deny 
their ugly past in one 
fell swoop. 

Ten minutes later, Joanna’s ultra-chic, 
ultra-successful Aunt Ramona (Sigourney 

Weaver) turns — hair flowing, bathed in 
golden light, announced by an angel cho-
rus — to face Marni’s mother Gail (Jamie 
Lee Curtis) and, in case it wasn’t clear the 
first time, serves as a reminder that you 

can never live down 
who you once were. 
Not  if you’re Gail, 
who watches her 
own high school 
nemesis rattle off a 
list of accomplish-
ments that include 
owning 14 exclusive 
hotel chains and 

remaining on Forbes’ 
100 Most Powerful Women list for an 
11th consecutive year. 

Commence the next 70 minutes, as 

Marni desperately tries to reveal Joanna’s 
true colors to her adoring family, and 
Gail breaks sink drains and gets speed-
ing tickets trying to one-up Ramona. 
There’s a disastrous impromptu dance-off 
that ends in a pile of bruises, a cringe-
inducing wedding rehearsal speech and 
plenty of pratfalls: people falling into an 
ant hole (Marni) and a swimming pool 
(Ramona), falling out of a treehouse (Will 
and Joanna), and knocking down half the 
family in an attempt to outdo the compe-
tition with a mid-air leap (Gail).

The comedic timing is well done, and 
the movie has plenty of funny moments 
— including every time Marni’s feisty 
cougar of a Grandmother Bunny (Betty

Taking Down Gossip Girls

Old (Dread-
locked) Man 
and the Sea
Oscar Winner Takes a Look at 

Relationships in Play Adaptation
By Rusteen Honardoost

S tories about social misfits finding love are 
hardly revolution-
ary, but “Jack Goes 
Boating” manages to 
captivate through its 
complex look at cou-
ples doing what they can to make their relationships work.

The film, an adaptation of a play by Bob Glaudini, is long-
time theater director and actor Philip Seymour Hoffman’s 
directorial debut. Hoffman, along with talented Broadway 
actors John Ortiz and Daphne Rubin-Vega, reprises his role 

from the original play 
as Jack — a meek, 
reggae-loving, dread-
locked man whose 
love life is practically 
non-existent.

So when his best 
friend Clyde (Ortiz) 
and his wife Lucy 
(Rubin-Vega) set Jack 
on a blind date with 
Lucy’s equally shy co-
worker Connie (new-

comer Amy Ryan), they start an uneasy, socially awkward 
relationship. Following some troubles of her own, Connie is 
uncomfortable being very “intimate” with Jack, despite their 
feelings for each other.

Jack, eager to please Connie, jumps at her mention that

she’d like to go boating, and makes plans to go six 
months in advance, though he doesn’t know how 
to swim.  Clyde offers to help, teaching Jack how 
to doggy paddle at the local YMCA. Jack’s path 
for self-confidence is mirrored by the other occu-
pants of the pool, among them a legless old man, 
and the shots in these swimming scenes — taking 
place both above and below the water — stand out 
as some of the most beautiful of the film. 

Hoffman is a subtle director, preferring to use 
little bits of character development to push the 
story along instead of long, emotional monologues 
(save for an over-dramatic climax that feels out of 

place among the calm tone of the film). And his 
acting proves effective as well. While shopping for 
a gift for Connie, Hoffman’s Jack somehow exudes 
humor without making a sound, proving how 
effortless his performance is.

In addition, Ortiz is both confident and vul-
nerable throughout the film. When he confides 
some of his personal insecurities to Jack, he’s able 
to make a quick jump from tears to a smile feel 
believable. 

Some aspects, however, don’t work as well. 
The transition from theater to screen isn’t entirely 
seamless. The way the climax is staged feels as if it 
were created for theater, where each actor’s actions 

are seen consecutively, rather than individually 
dissected.

Hoffman does take some good advantages 
out of his new medium. His use of montage 
and slow motion feels more original than cli-
ché — a good sign from a first-time director. 
And he should be commended for his editing. 
With a 90-minute running time, the film moves 
quickly and keeps each scene and the characters 
from dragging on for too long. All-in-all, “Jack 
Goes Boating” doesn’t bring anything entirely 
groundbreaking to the table, but it is a more 
than competent debut from a new actor turned 
director.  

White) hits on men Marni’s age, or 
when Kristin Chenoweth appears 
as Georgia King, the extremely tan 
wedding planner with a Southern 
drawl and corny dance lessons to 
match. Curtis and Weaver perfect 
the frenemy interaction, as they 
wear fake grins and taunt each 
other aggressively in a race down 
the street. Bell’s Marni — though 
frenzied enough to illegally dig up 
archives to fulfill her goals — is lik-
able and shows that no matter how 
circumstances change, something 
about high school makes old insecu-
rities flare up.

But “You Again” falls flat because 
director Andy Finkman (She’s the 
Man) spends 80 minutes showing 
how deep old wounds can be, then 
suggests that they’re actually quite 
shallow since the decade-old scars 
are healed right before the credits 
roll. After the film sets up repeated, 
painful flashbacks of being locked out 
of homeroom by classmates singing 
“We Are the Champions,” it’s hard to 
believe that everything can be fixed 
in fewer than five minutes. There’s no 
true cathartic closure.

“You Again” is thin on plot. The 
most interesting part of the movie 
is figuring out, detective-style, what 
Joanna is up to, and once that’s 
solved, it’s just a few more funny 
incidents until the inevitable rec-
onciliation as everyone emerges 
triumphant.

Flying lotus
pattern + Grid world
wARp ReCoRdS

S teven Ellison, an LA-based DJ otherwise known as Flying Lotus, is known for his trippy, 
experimental electronica — chock-
full with an almost overwhelm-
ing variety of sounds — whether 
it appears in dense, compli-
cated LPs like Los Angeles and 
Cosmogramma, or light instrumen-
tal bumps for Adult Swim. 

His newest EP, Pattern + Grid 
World, leans more toward the 
minimal techno of the latter than 
his fully realized albums. Lasting 
only a brief 18 minutes, with each 
track clocking in at less than three 
minutes, his latest features spastic 
flashes of chaos and — unlike his 
previous release, Cosmogramma — 
is synth-heavy, instrumental and 
features rare live instruments. 

Pattern + Grid World kicks off 
with “Clay,” a bizarre track with a 
galloping drumbeat and an alien 
synth to create a highly textured 
sound. “Kill Your Coworkers” 
incorporates 8-bit into the pro-
ceedings while “Jurassic Notion/M 

Theory” has various clicks, clacks 
and beeps wandering around aim-
lessly throughout the song. 

The third track, “Pie Face,” tries 
to be as disorganized as possible, 
incorporating everything from 
random beeping to a quick snare-
drum roll to stay unpredictable; by 
the time “Time Vampires” comes 
along, the laid-back whistling is 
a welcome breather. With Flying 
Lotus, the unpredictable is always 
expected; the more subtle tracks 
thus prove to be more effective. EP 
high point “Camera Day” is there-
fore similarly mellow, featuring 
long, spiraling synth sounds to put 
the listener in a trance.

With its quick spasms of sound, 
it’s apparent that Pattern + Grid 
World isn’t meant to be an intense 
new offering to FlyLo fans, but 
rather, a kind of dessert to the 
Cosmogramma entree — some-
thing that can be enjoyed in brief 
bursts of creative energy.

AlbumREVIEWS

M argot & the Nuclear So and So’s doesn’t like to produce hits for the purpose of lining their 
record label’s wallets. After all, their 
sophomore album was released during 
a disagreement with Epic Records — a 
dispute that resulted in two versions 
of the record: the band’s more com-
plex tracklist, Animal!, and the label’s 
parred-down version, Not Animal. But 
now that the band has signed to indie 
label Mariel Recording Company, they 
have the opportunity to hone a sound 
that is all their own — drama free. 

Buzzard is a versatile album, filled 
with the mellow tracks the band is 
known for, while still exploring louder 
soundscapes. The songs, varied as 
their musical style can be, are united 
under one message that permeates 
Buzzard’s eccentric track list: Let your 
freak flag fly. 

There are songs like “Earth 
to Aliens: What Do You Want,” a 
mournful ballad with a quirky edge 
that plays like an ode to Bill Nye the 
Science Guy. It can’t help but speak to 
the inner nerd in all of us wondering 

what lies beyond the stars. 
Lead singer Richard Edwards goes 

on to advocate giving our mouths 
a dose of a different hue with the 
catchy-as-hell chorus of “Let’s Paint 
Our Teeth Green,” while the rest of the 
band throws in some scratchy, Black 
Keys-style guitar riffs. 

There are more odd tracks that 
suggest the extraordinary: “Tiny 
Vampire Robot” is a love song to — 
you guessed it — mechanical blood-
suckers (that don’t sparkle in the sun), 
“Lunatic, Lunatic, Lunatic,” addresses 
the woes of a girl who really does 
paint her teeth green, while a mixture 
of animals, bluesy tunes and birds in 
“Claws Off” completes the variety. 

The intriguing song titles and cun-
ning lyrics of Buzzard give the album 
a solid place among the more acoustic 
Margot pantheon. The amplified gui-
tars and heavier drumming, however, 
take it to the blurred edge where inde-
pendent meets mainstream, giving the 
work a more widespread appeal.

“She’s very good all-around 
player that could probably play 
any position on the court.” 

Despite the changes, expec-
tations will be high as the 
Tritons try to continue the suc-
cess they had in 2009. The 
team rose as high as No. 2 in 
the national rankings, compil-
ing a 29–3 record and losing 
just twice in the regular season. 
UCSD was upset by No. 19 
Cal State Los Angeles in the 
NCAA West Regionals to end 
the season.

“We have high expecta-
tions,” Luyties said. “We want 
to win the conference cham-
pionship. We want to go far in 
the NCAA tournament. The 
team was so successful last 
year, and we have quite a few 
returning players.”

The No. 8 Tritons 
opened their season strong 
at the Phoenix Inn GNAC 
Conference Challenge in 
Monmouth, Ore., winning 
three of their four games 
in the two-day tourna-
ment. UCSD then returned 

home on Sept. 10 for their 
conference opener against 
Humboldt State, and swept 
the Lumberjacks 3–0 in an 
easy win. The Tritons con-
tinued their dominance 
with another 3–0 home win 
against Sonoma State the fol-
lowing night.

However, the Tritons fal-
tered after their strong season 
start, suffering three consecu-
tive losses in games against 
No. 24 Cal State East Bay, Cal 
State Monterey Bay and San 
Francisco State. The losses 
dropped UCSD to No. 21 in 
the national rankings.

“I think we’re going through 
a bit of a growing process right 
now,” Luyties said. “But I like 
the way the players have react-
ed to it so far.”

The Tritons will look to 
rebound as they continue 
their road trip this weekend 
with games at Chico State and 
Cal State Stanislaus on Sept. 
24 and 25, respectively.

Tritons to Battle Inexperience, Tough Schedule in 2010 

EriK JEpsEn/Guardian FilE

Senior midfielder Shane Micheil’s leadership and offensive creativity will be integral to the Tritons if they hope to improve on last year’s 4-9-5 season.

Coach McManus, however, 
chose not to dwell on the losses, 
and instead focused on the posi-
tives of his team.

“There is no one area where 
we are particularly strong,” 
McManus said. “The big thing 
with the team is if one player 
is having a bad day, that player 
makes sure the opposing player 
she is playing against has a bad 
day. ... It is a close team and 

everybody wants to play for 
each other.”

The Tritons will travel to face 
Cal State Monterey Bay on Sept. 
24 and San Francisco State on 
Sept. 26. Their next home game 
is scheduled for Oct. 1, with 
a match against Cal State San 
Bernardino.

All Starters Return for Tritons

in league play and without a playoff 
appearance. UCSD will not face an easy 
schedule, as the CCAA featured three 
of the nation’s top-20 teams in the pre-
season Division-II rankings.

The return of two top scorers — 
senior midfielders David Bakal and 
Shane Micheil — will hopefully give 
the Tritons a boost, with further help 
coming from defensive stalwart senior 
and three-time all-CAA honors recipi-
ent Jared Kukura.

But the Tritons will have to replace 
eight players from last season, includ-
ing UCSD’s all-time save leader Peter 
Akman. Currently, Pascale has handed 
off the keeper job to redshirt freshman 
Jesse Brennan, who will have to mature 
quickly to anchor the Tritons’ back line.

After two matches against Dominican 
University and Notre Dame de Namur, 
CCAA play began on Sept. 10 with a 
difficult home opener against No. 2 
CSU Los Angeles. Though it was a tight 

game in the early minutes, with the 
Tritons holding their ground, it opened 
up unexpectedly in the second half as 
the Tritons experienced an unlucky own 
goal. This proved enough to get the 
Golden Eagles going and they added 
two more goals for a final score of 3–0 
to the visitors.

The Tritons had an equally tough 
game against No. 19 Cal State Dominguez 
Hills days later on Sept. 12. UCSD fell 
behind 0–2 by halftime, but a 75th min-
ute goal from freshman defender Alec 
Arsht put the Tritons back in the game. 
Sadly, no late equalizer materialized and 
the Tritons fell once again with a score 
of 1–2.

The Tritons have only just begun the 
season, and Pascale is looking forward 
to future improvements.

“We are indeed disappointed with 
the results but we have moved on very 
quickly,” Pascale said.

Both Micheil and Bakal have con-
tinued to be a presence on the field in 

these early stages of the season, dictating 
the pace of play for the Tritons. Coach 
Pascale is confident in both their and the 
rest of the team’s abilities.

“We have a number of guys who have 
the capabilities to score goals, including 
Shane and Dave,” Pascale said. “I am 
confident that they will both find the 
back of the net this season.”

The arrival of freshman players has 
added a new layer of deft and agility to 
the team, as shown with Arsht’s header 
— assisted by sophomore Kian Malek’s 
cross— that resulted in the only Triton 
goal scored in the young season.

The Tritons depart for a Northern 
California road trip this weekend, facing 
Cal State Monterey Bay on Sept. 24 and 
San Francisco State on Sept. 26. UCSD 
returns to Triton Stadium on Oct. 1, 
when they will play against No. 11 Cal 
State San Bernardino.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL —Despite a few new 
faces and a new system, 2010 is far from a rebuild-
ing year for UCSD’s women’s volleyball team. If the 
changes are made smoothly, the Tritons have the 
potential to continue their success from last season 
and make another playoff run. 

Tom Black, who coached the team for five years, 
has left to take the head coaching job at Loyola 
Marymount University. Black guided UCSD to a 
overall record of 115-29 during his tenure, including 
four straight postseason appearances. His replace-

ment is Ricci Luyties, a former Olympic volleyball 
player and self-described conventional coach.

 “The previous coach ran a system that was very 
regimented, where they teach one thing that they 
want each player to do,” Luyties said. “I’m more of a 
traditional, old-school type coach. I try to look for 
what the player does best and utilize that.”

 Luyties comes to UCSD from the University 
of Southern Mississippi, where he led the Golden 
Eagles to their first ever Conference USA title in 
2009.

 The Tritons return five starters, but graduated 
All-Americans Sylvia Schmidt and Elaine Chen have 
to be replaced. Junior Janessa Werhane has stepped 
up at libero, and has played well enough to ensure 
the departed seniors are not too badly missed. Of 
the returning starters, senior All-American Roxy 
Brunsting will lead the way after making the switch 
from libero to outside hitter.

 “Roxy has done a great job so far,” Luyties said.

WOMEN’S SOCCER — September is half-
way over, but the women’s soccer team has 
only begun to stretch their legs. As one of the 
top programs at UCSD, the team enters their 
2010 campaign with high expectations and 
even higher hopes.

Head Coach Brian McManus, who clocks 
in as one of UCSD’s most successful coach-
es with two NCAA Division-II and five 
Division-III national championships under 
his belt, enters his 24th season with vir-
tually the same squad as last year. The 
Tritons return all 11 starters, 10 of whom 
were freshmen or sophomores last season. 
Despite the youthful squad, McManus’ side 
had a successful campaign that ended in a 
heartbreaking penalty shootout loss in the 
NCAA Division-II Regional Qualifiers on 
November 20, 2009.

With their success last season and the 
amount of returning talent, the Tritons were 
the conference coaches’ preseason pick to 
win this year’s CCAA crown. UCSD also 
gained respect nationally, garnering the No. 
20 slot in the preseason division-II rankings.

Players to watch include junior midfield-
er Shelby Wong, who finished last season 

with six goals and five assists, and junior 
midfielder Anne Wethe, who will look to 
make even more of an impact after ending 
last season with 14 points.

Despite the squad’s many returning play-
ers, the Tritons are not without newcomers. 
The most surprising is undoubtedly senior 
Annette Ilg, who — after exhausting her four 
years of eligibility on the basketball team — 
made the switch to McManus’ squad. With 
three goals already this season, Ilg seems to 
have made the transition smoothly.

“The addition of Annette brings a 
senior’s sense of the UCSD sports program,” 
McManus said. “She also brings us some 
height and speed, and tenacity to chase 
down every ball.”

UCSD began the season with exhibition 
matches against Dominican University and 
Notre Dame de Namur. The Tritons easily 
dispatched both opponents, winning by a 
combined score of 8–0. Ilg was awarded 
CCAA Player of the Week for her part in 
the games.

The Tritons rose to sixth in the national 
rankings following the wins, but faced a 
tricky league opener against No. 23 Cal 

State Los Angeles on Sept. 10. The first half 
went scoreless for both sides, but the Golden 
Eagles came out strong in the second half 
with three goals in 30 minutes. Sophomore 
Alyssa Newcomer added a late goal, but it 
was not enough, as the Tritons fell, 1–3.

Two days later, the Tritons bounced back 

with a dominating 3–0 victory over No. 9 
Cal State Dominguez Hills, but they faced 
another test with their first road game at 
Humboldt State. On Sept. 17, two second-
half goals allowed the Lumberjacks to rally 
for a surprise 2–1 victory. UCSD fell to No. 
25 in the rankings after the losses.

2009 RecoRd:  15-5-2 (11-5 in CCAA)

RetuRning staRteRs:  11 - GK Kristin Armstrong, D Haley Johnson, D Sara 
Spaventa, M/D Lisa Bradley, D Ellen Wilson, M Shelby Wong, M Jessica Wi, M Anne 
Wethe, M Danielle Dixon, F Sarah McTigue, F Alyssa Newcomer 

bottom line:  With all of their starters back — and with the added firepower of 
Annette Ilg — the Tritons should be able to match or improve their 2009 win total. 
An extra year of experience gives the squad the potential to go even further in the 
playoffs, and could make the team an outside contender for the national title.

women’S Soccer

MEN’S SOCCER — Walk past 
RIMAC Field on any given night, 
and you’ll hear it: the distinct, 
swift rustling of feet against 
freshly cut grass, the blunt echo 
of foot-to-ball contact as an 
encroaching winger smashes the 
ball toward the net, the grunt of 
exertion as the keeper leaves his 
feet, with hands sprawled hope-
fully in the air.

Yes, soccer season has 
returned.

UCSD men’s soccer comes 
into their 2010 campaign led by 
seven seniors and an influx of 
young talent, but Coach John 
Pascale’s side have yet to prove 
that they can be competitive in 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play. The team will 
look to improve from last season, 
which ended with a 4–9–3 record
