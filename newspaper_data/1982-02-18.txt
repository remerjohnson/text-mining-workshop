ome long awaited progre s 

in the effort to advance 
cooperative hou~ing on 
campu, e ha ' finally been 
made in th la t everal w k .. 

Two major developments in 
housing at UC have taken 
place that are worth repeating 
and warrant reflection. A few 
weeks ago, the Rochdale 
Hou 'ing Project , a tudent 
c perative located in I la 
Vista, adjacent to the t C 
Santa Barbara campus, 
re eived the funding neces" 
sary to purchase its first 
building. Th receipt of these 
monies, amounting to 

110,000, and approved by the 
Santa Barbara County Board 
of upervI or., when added to 
$50,000 already donated by the 
UC B administration. will 
ensure that a unique brand of 
cooperative hou Ing will be 
available to anta Barbara 
. t udents for many years to 
come. 

Almost simultaneously, the 
UC Board of Regents was

approving in principle a poltcy 
that would allow ~tudent 
registration fee to be used for 
the fir 't tIme to acquire 
existing community hou ing. 
Th e two events underscore 
the tremendou ' opportunity 
we now have to solve the 
housing problem at UC, and 
serve to focu attention on the 
development of cooperative 
hou ing a a particularly 
effective mean to this end. 

Alt hough cooperative theory 
can be made to sound qUIte 
complex, the i'\rgument in 
favor of student co-op 
development i ' relatively 
simple. For example, much 
has been said lately about the 
wonders of "supply side"

idea are heard rna t often 
from builders and developer. 
who argu that hou ' ing 
problems can be solved 
primarily by increasing 
supply, uch as building more 
houses and apartments. 
Forgetting for a while that 
. uch a program would likely be 
stymied by impo. sibly high 
interest rates and significant 
questions about the environ" 
ment and open space, ther i!-t 
little doubt that increased 
home building would have 
"orne effect on hou ' ing 

availability and price 
HO\vever, in order to bring the 
traditional uppl, and demand 
curves into balance, a shortfall 
of nearly one mIllion units 
wou ld have to be compensated 
for, practically overnight. 

Clearly, it make ' more sen e 
to pur ue programs that deal 
with the "d mand " or price 
' ide of the equation. For 
instance, some communities 
have turned to rent control.

How ver, as most people

particularly controversial 
program and is therefore more

Administration plans 
to "save families" Waiting for the ice age By DIRK VanPEENEN ju t as I got here_" 

"Oh . That's good." 
Richard Schweiker didn't 

deserve a single Valentine this 
year. Judging from hi 
remark at a Hou e subcom-
mittee hearing two weeks ago, 
the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services is bound to 
widen the gap between young 
people and their parents. 

proposal is implemented, 
many of those parents whom 
the admini tration seeks to 
notify about their children's 
sexual activity will not learn 
about it until their daughters 
come home pregnant ." 

It was nine o'clock when I 
got to the bus stop. Actually 
I'm not sure exactly what time 
it was because ] don't own a 
watch. But I'd just gotten off 
work, so I'm sure it was close 
to nine. It could on ly have 
taken me a few minutes to 
walk the half mile or so. 

He sat down. She remained 
standing, peering down the 
road. You couldn't really see 
much because we were at the 
top of a hill and the bus top is 
on a corner. You cou ldn 't even 
ee the cars until they were 

almost there. 

said that record cold 
temperatures had been set all 
over the country, following a 
general cooling trend . The 
greenhouse effect was 
evident ly just another theory 
that had proven wrong, 
though it had lifted a few 
eyebrows at first - s till does 
in some places. 

Almost two month ago, 
Schweiker proposed that 
federally-funded family 
planning clinics nutify the 
parent of clients under 18 
who'd requested prescriptions 
for contraceptives, Later t hi 
month, chweiker is expected 
to issue the rules in their final 
form . 

But Schweiker, a former 
running mate of Ronald 
Reagan' , i n't budging from 
hi original position. He told 
the Hou e Subcommittee on 
Health and the Environment 
la st Tuesday that the 
government's policy of 
' ecretly providing birth 
control pre criptions i more 
dangerous to families than his 
proposed regulation requiring 
parental notification. "We've 
built a Berlin Wall between the 
kid and the parent. We think 
that's wrong." 

A guy and a girl (hi 
girlfriend I uppose) got there 
a few minute after I did . I slid 
over on the bench so they cou Id 
s it down . 

She at down , after a few 
si lent minutes, but got up (!s 
soon as she heard a car 
coming. 

A few more cars pa sed. I 
threw down my cigarette and 
stood up. ] could hear the bus 
coming up the hill. I imagined 
a huge tusked mammoth 
s tumbling in the dark, its 
trunk swinging from side to 
side, pushing itself up a snowy 
incline tep by step. 

"Maybe this is it," she said, 
hitching her backpack up over 
her shoulder. I cou ld tell it 
wasn't the bus. You could 
always tell when it wa 
coming. Before it gets to the 
top, climbing up the last few 
yards, the sou nd it makes I 
like an elephant - throaty and 
high pitched, st rained. 

The girl also got up. Her 
boyfriend laughed, folded hi 
arms, "I t won't be here for a 
while," he said , She said 
nothing. 

It 's not as if the implications 
of Schweiker's plan are 10 ton 
tho e American who'll be 
most affected . "What's the 
POlOt of going in for help if 
they 're just going to rat on 
us?" one young high school 
student from Loui iana asked 
u recently . Added the editor,

Minnesota Daily : "If this

last August to "encourage" 
parental involvement in

" Do you know what time it

attempt to start conversation. 
I've waited for thi bus before 
and fou nd that the time 
always passes more rapidly 
when there's someone to talk 
to. But then again , [ rea oned, 
there's never anything to say.

soon. So apparently did they . 
A t least s he did. 

"No," he said , "but I hope

T he Bottom Line 

Reflections on the local wilderness 
By DA YID SEWELL 

Each year Muir College offers a course called 
"Wilderne s and Human Value ." It alwavs 
concludes WIth a field expedition to some locale that 
everyone agrees is "t he wilderness" : the de ert, the 
Sierra, someplace far away and romantic, omeplace 
"untouched ." What we tend to forget is that despite 
the adjacent boulevards, condos, and shopping 
man ,our campu itselfi etdowninthemidd leof 
wilderness; we border on expanses as mysterious as 
any John Muir ever ex plored . 

I live in the South Me a Apartments, and when I 
go out walking or jogging I like to get off the st reet 
and onto the dirt roads and paths that lead into the 
chaparral-covered fields nort h of La Jolla Village 
Drive. They are small , littered here and there witJ, 
tras h, and doomed to be developed , but you can st ill 
find there uch wonder as crub oak , jackrabbits , 
ant lion_, milky Quartz, and pungent sage. it down 
in a clearing and you can pretend you're a Digueno 
Indian living at a time before even the Spanish came 
- at least until a jet from Miramar screams b) 
overhead . 

One recent weekend afternoon I jogged acro~s 
Genes ee and followed a dirt road, intending to cut 
north up to Eastgate Mall r had nearly r ached the 
paved road when I noticed two men in the brus h 
ahead. They had not seen me; for a moment I thought 
about turning around . I remembered the time when, 
jogging on an isolated trail in a park outside ew 
Haven , Connecticut, I came upon two young men 
engaged in an activity which would have earned 
them th death penalty back in Puritan days. 
Nothing threatening. more an embarrassment than 
anything. This tIme. then. I decided to k ep ~oing. 
What I found as r rounded a curve \\ as entirely 
different from what I had expected . 

Sittin~ in an open patch und r the bus hes were 

'even or eight men and a couple of women, One of 
the women had a blue blanket wrapped around her 
like a shawl. Illegal aliens, almost certainly; the 
recognition came instantaneously. I wa not 
e pecially concerned : when I lived out in Alpine I 
would occas ionally meet groups of illegals hiking 
North through the back country. Sometimes they 
were friendly and asked for directions, sometimes 
they looked worried and passed Quickly, but they 
were never hostile. So I just jogged through the 
middle of the group and said "hi," a greeting echoed 
by one of the men . 

Nearly a dozen indocumetllados not fifty yards 
from Eastgate Mall! Were they worried that I wou ld 
report them? Where were they going? How had they 
arrived there without being noticed? There could be 
not hing more incongruous t han this gypsy-band 
camped just down the road from a placid 
condominium complex . 

My adven t ures were not over. I crossed t he st reet 
and began joggin~ north up a dirt road that runs far 
back along a wide brush-covered ridge. I had gone 
only a short way when I notIced a message scratched 
into t he edge of t he road where t he dirt was s till soft 
from the previous clay's rain . IF YOl COME HERE 
YOl! MAY BE KILLED. And s uddenl y the road [had 
been on so often , t he ridge where I had sat and 
watched hawk. and rabbit., frighten d me. What 
did the message mean? Had someone seen the party 
of aliens and taken alarm. or was an entirely 
different group of desperados hiding out up ahead? 
Or was it just a loca l kid \ grim joke? I had no Idea . 
But J was spooked now , a nd turned around to jog 
hom on the dull but safe pav d road. 

Those fields are t rue wilderness, and not just 
because they have yet to be s trangled by suburbIa. 
To the American coloni sts, as to their European 
parents, "wi lderness" meant that menllcing zone of 

uncultivated land which surrounded every village 
and farm. Wolves lived there, but also outlaws, 
Robin Hoods, witches, mad hermits. William 
Bradford wrote of the terror the Pilgrims felt when 
contrary winds forced them to land at unfamiliar 
Plymouth: "What could they see but a hideous and 
desolate wilderness, full of wild beasts and wild 
men? And what multitudes of them knew not." 
True wilderness means the unknown, the 
unexpected . It is not an affair of topo maps and trail 
guides. Arthur 's knights never rode into the fore t 
of Broceliande without their best swords; any turn 
in the path might reveal a giant or a "tray tour 
knight" to battle. 

It is too bad that the wild places should be 
dangerous primarily on account of the human beasts 
lurking there. I used to take a book into the middle of 
the thick brus h just north of Central Library, where 
the on ly apparent hazards were s harp yucca spikes 
and hungry ants. I mentioned this place to a friend 
once, and s he said , "Oh, that's a dangerous place. 
People have gotten raped there." That spoi led it for 
me. Nowadays when I s it out. ide it is mostly on the 
lawns. 

It may be , though , that our obsessive need for 
security is t he greatest danger of a ll. When we grow 
afraid of the wi ld we begin to want to de ·troy it. 
There are poeple who wi ll not be content until our 
campus is in the midst of one giant ni v rs ity 
Towne Centre, where gypsie. can be routed by the 
pol ice and scru b brush by t he landscapers . We 
cannot afford to ignore Thoreau on thi s lopi : "Our 
vi ll age life \\'ould stagnate if it were not for the 
unexplored forests and meadows whIch surround it. 
We need the tonic of wilcln 'S5 ." The chaparral ii=' my 
Walden Pond , and J mu!' t go back there, death 
t hrear s or no. I h,we dou btlcssly com much doserto

Reagan proposal on _Hu_b~ig~ __________________ __

, 'I ,fi'lh.: d fl 4 0 1l1 pag'" ~ 
Lobby have been pressu ring 
Schweike r to interpret 
Congress' language as a 
mandate for parental 
notification. A nd they seem to 
have gotten their way. 

Unfortunately, word of 
Schweikers proposed regula-
t ions has perhaps already 
steered thousands of teens 
away from prescri ption 
contraceptives to less reliable 
method s s uch as foam s, 
condoms and withdrawal. 

The Alan Guttmacher 
Institute, w hich is affiliated 
with the Planned Parenthood 
Foundation of America and 
widely regarded a s the' 
nation's leading authority on 
teenage fertility , estimates 
that 25 percent of the nearly] 
million teenagers who rely on 
federally - funded c lini cs 
wouldn't patronize s uch 
places under the new rule. 
Only 2 percent of this group, 
the institu te contend , would 
sacrifice sexu al activity for t he 
sake of Mom and Dad. The 
result would surely mean a 
higher teenage pregnancy rate. 

As a father of five, 
Schweiker ought to know that 
most teenagers today can't 
talk about their own sex live 
in the company of parents and 
expect a mature re ponse. 
Instead, he places often 
traumatic matters of sex uality 
in the same league with 
question of report card and 
chool attendance. " Parent s 

must give written permission 
before a child can go on a 

school trip and must exp lain 
when a child is absent from 
class for even one day ," he 
said . " It' s paradox ical.. .. " 

Does Schweiker reall y 
believe parents will dispat ch 
wi th a teenager' s birth control 
needs just as blithely as they 
do with permiss ion slips and 
gym class excuses? Doesn ' t he 
realize that Uncle Sam invites 
exces estrangement when 
Dad learns of Amy's new 
diaphragm? ( Sin ce all 
prescription contraceptives 
are for women , the proposed 
regulation would spare young 
men from such embarrassing 
scenes with parents.) 

Of course, parents should 
know as much as possible 
about a child's personal life. 
It 's a natural responsibility. 
But it's improper ami ill -
founded for agovernment to do 
the background briefing. 

If the administration is 
wi lling to risk additional 
alienat ion bet ween genera-
tion , Schweiker and the New 
Right are only undermining 
their own goal of bringing 
families "together. " Indeed , 
this blind response to the 
teenage pregnancy problem 
may indicate the admini tra-
tion 's actual objective: It 
wants out of the contracept ion 
business in the hope of 
bringing the moral s tature of 
thi . country in line with it 
ideal. . 

Young people, who already 
have a difficult time growing 
up, are left in the lurch .

Reagan's cut s in financial aide 
Editor: 

Ju t recently I learned of the 
massive financial aid cut 
proposed fo r the Reagan 
Administration's budget. And, 
boy, am I di turbed. 

Beginning February 9, there 
will be no graduate student 
lo a n s, and three other 

financial loans, the Supple-
mental Education Opportun-
ity Grant , the National DIrect 

tudent Loans, and the tate 
tudent Initiative Grant , will 

also be eliminated. 
Wh at L a UCSD . tudent

I. personally, come from a 

lower middle cla s back· 
ground, and mu t rely on my

Let u ... hope that our

urely one of t he most basic

on the locat ion and times of

more ann oy ing than baffling 
that the University Books tore 
restr icts access [Q t hesched u Ie 
of classes to a very lim ited 
number of sites on campu s. 
While t hey regularly supply 
the Revelle Sundry Store w it h

difficult for the student-run 
General Store to provide them. 
In the pa t, they have agreed in 
pri nc i p l e to se ll c lass

only after discussion and with 
delay. Now they are only 
wi ll ing to let the General Store

This near-monopoly is as 
frustrati ng to u as it is to our

make it clear to students that 
our inability to supply enough

not convince the book tore to

Professors contribute to legislators 
Santa Barbara democrat most popular 

By H ENRY SCHULMAN 
Sacramento Correspondent 

SACRAMENTO - Cam-
paign fin ance disclos ure 
tatements show univers ity 

professors and administra-
. tors, as well a profes or and 

teacher organizations, 
frequently donate money to 
sta te legi s lators in key 
education posi tion s. 

Un i versi ty -related don a-
tions were prominent , for 
example. in the 1980 re-
election campaign of Assem· 
blymember Gary Hart (0 -
Santa Barbara), who·e dis trict 
contains the University of 

California at anta Barbara. 
Hart chairs the Assembly 

Ways and Means subcommit-
tee on education , which plays a 
major role in budget 
deliberations. Hart al 0 chair 
th Education Subcommittee 
on Educational Reform. 

A four-term legisl<ltor, Hart 
has indicated he will seek the 
Democratic state Senate seat 
vacated by Omer Rains thi 
year. Rain will run for 
attorney general. 

Anoth er legislator with 
severa l teaching-related 
contribution · is A embly-
member John Vasconcellos (D-

an Jose). who chairs the 
Ways and Means Committee. 
He was formerly chair of the 
Subcommittee on Postsecon-
dary Education . 

Va co n ce llo ' district 
includes San J ose State 
University, wit h 25,000 
st udents, the second-large. t of 
the 19 California State 
Univer ·it y campuses. 

Aside from their proximity 
to educational issues in the 
legis lature, Vasconcellos and 
Hart are known as -upporters 
of greater university funding 
and state responsibility for 
education. 

Biden speaks on 
foreign policy 

Hart . for example. is the 
sponsor of a current Assembly 
resolution calling for a s tudy 
on sett ing new fee structures 
for the state's universities, so 
tuition can be avoided. 

BY NICK T. HANNA Contributions to Hart and 
Vasconcellos from profe sors 
and university employees 
range from $50 to $300. with 
most at roughly $100. 

Last Tuesday, the political 
science department and the 
ASUCSD sponsored a lecture 
by veteran US Senator Joseph 
Biden (D) of Delaware. The 
senator, who is a member of 
bot h t he foreign relation s and 
foreign intelligence commit-
tees, spoke to a large audience 
on the problems in the Reagan 
administration's foreign 
policy with pecial emphasis 
on El Salvador and the NATO 
a lliance. 

The senator wasted little 
time in lashing out at the 
current adm ini stratio n 's 
foreign policy, characlerizi ng 
it as "almost utter confu ion 
Every time they open their 
mouths they tend to subtract 
from the sum total of human 
knowledge." 

Biden discussed the NATO 
alliance at great length saying 
that it was originally 
conceived a an essential 
building block of foreign 
policy. The Reagan policy, said 
Biden , does not employ NATO 
at all as a corners tone. Our 
policy, he said, is born out of a 
myopic view of the interes ts of 
the US, with no coordination 
of policy bet wen ourselves and 
our allie . The enator fears 
that Reagan is unknowingly 
doing exactly what the Soviets 
ha ve been trying to do, that is, 
plit NATO.

In attempting to create a 
foreign policy. Biden said , 
Re agan has surroun ded 
himself with two groups of 
"experts," the pragmatists 
and the ideologues. In almost 
e\'ery instance. aid Blden. the 
ideologues have won out and 
this ha perpetuated a "the 
Russians are coming" 
atmosphere. 

This attitude. said Biden. 
has brought back the notion of 
a spread in?: "international 
communism' and the idea 
that every conflict in the world 
is a battle between the 
s uperpowers. For example, 
Biden asserted that the 
Admini . tration views the 
growing European pacifist 
movement as a oviet plot 
which is a prelude to the 
ultimate 'Finlandization' of 
the continent. The Adminis-
trat ion does not take into 
account that the Europeans 
might be genuinely fearful of 
nuclear war, Biden assented. 

In addition, this ideological 
tance is about to develop into 

a two China policy with the 
proposed sa le of weapons to 
Taiwan . "Our expanding 
relations with Taiwan is the 
only thing which might drive 
China toward the oviet 
Union ," Biden explained.

Foreign students

<AJIXt..:J t/.C~E If you are a foreign student 

at UCSD, you may feel more 
like a political and economic 
commodity than a s tudent. 

" Kn ow ledge transcends 
borders, but knowledge is also 
an inst rument of international 
competition," aid William 
M cG ill, former UCSD 
chancellor , at Tues da y's 
di cus ion entitled "The Role 
of the Univer it y in the 
Preparation of International 
Scholarships. " 

McGill , along with Chancel· 
lor Richard Atkinson and 
Roger Revelle, former director 
of Scripps Institute o f 
Oceanography, considered to 
what extent the university is 
obliged to fore ign students, 
foreign governments , US 
st udents , and the taxpayer 
who fund the University. 

McG ill was concerned about 
foreign student who ludy in 
the US under cholar hip 
from their own countries, and 
then "find ci rcumstances here 
that are so profoundly 
attractive that they don't want 
to leave." McGill wanted to 
avoid "draining the best people 
from countries that you're 
trying to help." 

Roger Revelle, however, felt 
t hat in underdeveloped 
count rie s, " most people 
(stu dent s) are wasted ." 
Neither Revelle nor Chancellor 
Atkinson were opposed to 
foreign students ettling in the 
US after getting their degree. 

Atkin on was more 
concerned wit h the cuts in the 
Reagan administration' 
budget, which could cause a 
"dramatic reduction of dollars 
to support foreign s tudents." 
Atkmson added that the first 
o fficial "government to 
government" document 
between the US and China 
involved exchanging students. 
Although relations between 
China and the US have 
improved since then, Atkinson 
believes that the Chinese wi ll 
be concerned about the United 
States' lack of support to 
Chinese exchange students. 

A former foreign student in 
the audience sa id that the $18 
million pent annually on 
supporting Chinese foreign 
students in only one percent of 
the US's increase in trade with 
China. 

The speakers also discussed 
many other issues. including 
whether or not certain 
technologica l advancements 
s hould be withheld from 
foreign st udents in the 
interest 01 International 
competition. Another problem 
di scussed was choosi ng 
whether or not to favor 
admitting tudent who e 
country hows good will 
toward the US . 

The speakers also voiced 
their concern for American 
tudents, many of whom are 

z '8 

"becoming a5 insulated and 
isolated as po ss ible ," 
according to Reve ll e. To 
exemplify t hi , Revelle pointed 
to the declining number of 
s tudents in foreign language 
classes. 

Chancellor Atkin on 
remarked that this problem 
may be due to poor language 
programs rat her than lack of 
interest. "We do . uch a 
terrible, terrible job of foreign 
language instru ction. The 
quality of instruction is so 
poor in the US that it raises

But , according to the 
s peakers, t he out look for

"Friends of the In ternational 
Center" . who sponsored the 
discus ion, were commended 
by the s peakers for their 
efforts in welcoming foreIgn 
scholars and their families to

"The e fiber optics come in

"To s tring them three miles, 

we joined the fibers by fu!>ing

fear their lo:-.t dog or cal is 
being subjected to painful 
experiment... at universities 
and hospit als. 

At a press conference earlier

warm , caring environment 
and is hound with its owner III 
an emotion al relat IOnshlp 

Expo~ing pet... to painful

more effective oplion~ are

and not in the best interests of

Eight y jJercent of the stray

pounds in California are put to 
deat h there. aecordi ng to the 

acramento Animal Control 
Agency. Only 20 percent are 
sold for research or given 
a\\ay, many to pri"ate 
families. 

But proponents of Roberti's 
legislation say putting 
animals to sleep is more 
humane than u. ing them for 

research. They gave reporters 
photos of a dog and cat. 
purportedly at the UC LA 
nuclear medicine department, 
",It h severa l wires st icking 
from their txldies. 

The dog, which looked thin 
and pale, wa~ reported ly 
injected wit h a radioact ive 
i"otope so doctors could follow 
its blood stream with X-rays . 

But a LJC official quic'kl~' 
discounted claims of inhu-

"pound seizure" restrict ions 
would cost t he university 
more money. 

Dr. Dale Brooks. director of 
UC Davis ' Animal Resources 
Service, exp lained th at 
anima ls used for surgi cal 
practice are anaest h i. ezed. 
After surgery, the animals are 
put to death wit h drug 
overdo"es. 

Brooks said he is opposed to 
Roberti's legi lation, which he 
said wi ll result in vetennary 
studen ts no longer havi ng the 
privilege of practicing surgical 

techniques on li\'e dogs and 
cats . 

"We use up to 2,000 animals 
per yea r ," said Brooks

Questionnaire 
Chas Janke l 
A&M Records 

As the moving for-ce behind 
the infamous band Ian Dury 
and the Blockhead ', Chas 
Jankel has achieved much 
critica l acclaim. "Hi t Me With 
You r Rhythm Stick" and" ex 
and Drugs and Rock and Roll" 
emerged as top ten hits in 
England and confounded 
music crit ics who found the 
band difficu lt to classify . 

The band's association with 
tiff Records clouded their 

reputation and unjust ly gave 
the band a label as a "punk" 
ban d. However on Chas 
Jankel's new album Question -
naire, there is no dou bt that he 
has establi, hed both himself 
and hi genre of music as a 
new direction for rock after the 
"new wave" era. 

Many people who like the 
Blockheads but find Ian Dury 
an noyi ngly dull w ill be 
pleasantly surprised by Chas 

Jankel 's vocal ability. Jankel, a 
respected musician , composer, 
and producer, tru ly shows 
himself to be a jack-of-all-
trade on Qu es tionnaire, 
playing what he con iders to 
be a combination of both Latin 
and Funk rhythms. "109," 
"Glad to Know You ," and the 
album's title track are certain 
to clear Jankel once and for all 
of his "punk" label. For as the 
song "Johnny Funk" on 
Jankel's new album states: 
This is the story oj Johllny 
Funk.! Who had made a wish 
when he was a punk. ! He had 
the urge and he had the spunk,l 
He wamlO learn to play the 
junk ....

VIDEO ENSEMBLE 
Drama 1878 MTh 7:00 - 10:00 p.m. 
After an initial period of examination 
of texts from the feminist theater, the 
course will focus on a live and a video 
production of one play to be selected 
by the class instructor. Rehearsals 
will emphasize technique that 
illuminate sexual politics, Men and 
women of varied backgrounds are

~ Instructor approval required. A 

solo a lbum and there was talk 
that Lowe was stay ing out of 
the studio. No so. In fact, Nick 
the Nile, Lowe's lat est album, 
is his best to date. It is fun ny, 
danceable, and sens itive. 

The sound is the fullest and 
most Inspired by Lowe ever. 
Havi ng a bac ku p band 
in c luding Steve Nieve, 
k eyboardist for Elvi s 
Costello's band the Attrac· 
tions; Paul Carrack, formerly 
of Squeeze; Martin Belmont, 
guitarist for the Rumour; and 
hi s wife Carlene Carter, the 
daughter of Johnny Ca h and 
June Carter, helped a bit. But 
the main reason for the 
succes of Lowe's new album 
is Lowe himself. _ Whether 
producing, composi ng, or 
performing, Lowe is never 
lacking creative genius. 

Anyone who can remember 
such Lowe gems as "Marie 
Provost" or "Going to See the 
(8a>' City) Rollers" will not be 
let down by Nick the Nije. 
Such songs as "Zulu Kiss" and 
"Stick it Where the Sun Don't 

hine" are ndearing samples 
of Lowe's gIft for the lyrical 
absurd. What makes thi" 
album special is Lowe's ability 
to mix t his absurdity with 
such emotional . ongs as "Too 
Many Teardrops." "My Heart 
Hurts" and "Couldn't Love 
You (Any More than I Do)." 

It would be enough to say 
that Lowe write ome of the

Non Stop Erotic Cabaret 
Soft Cell 
SlRE Records 

Soft Cell i the late t in a 
series of "techno pop" bands 
from England to relea 'e an 
album in the US. I say latest 
because this band plays music 
that is anything but new. 
Whether it 's borrowed from 
Orchestral ManOe\TeS In The 
Dark , Gary Numan, The 
Korgis, Cowboys Int erna-

tiona! or whomever else, it 
doesn't matter. Now that the 
newness of synthesizer music 
has worn off, it\ time for 
bands to establish their own 
sou nd and ultimately their 
own identitv . 

On Non Stop Erotic Cabaret, 
the Ii tener is confronted with 
a collection of ob ervation of 
urban alienation; an altempt 
at social statement that pales 
in comparison to other English 
bands like the Jam, or the now 
defunct Specials. Songwriter 
Marc Almond ing about 
urban disintegration, ("Seedy 
Films"), boredom ("Entertain 
Me" ), perversion (" Sex 
Dwarf"), and frustratIon 
("Fru tralion "). 

Whatever the !'ub)ect, the 
conclusion the lIstener draws 
is the same. Almond IS 
obviously disgu ' ted with the 
environment in which he li ves 
but seems resigned that thing~ 
won't change .. till , ", ay 
Hello. Wa\ e Goodbye", 'Chi ps 
on m\ h ould e r," and 
"Bedslt-ter" emerge a!-' brIght 
spo t s on an otherwi..,e 
unspectacular album.

These t\\'o belong in the pairs hall of fame 
BY JIM SCHUTZ 

Staff Writer 
Since time began, the world 

has produced many unique 
and outstanding "teams of 
two," a duo, a pair, partners. 
Adam and Eve, Anthony and 
Cleopatra, Abbott and 
Costello, Fred and Ginger, 
Nixon and Agnew, Laverne 
and Shirley".the list goes on 
forever. Two more names 
bound for glory are Parker and 
Freed of the UCSD Women's 

pJwlo by LII)l'll NKuyen 

Basketball team. Paulette 
Parker and Wendy Freed are 
the tarting guard for the 
Triton and are the "impetus 
to our offen e," Head Coach 
Judy Malone said. 

After a poor performance 
this year from the Men's 
Basketball squad, Men's 
Coach John block ought to 
renovat,e his offense and bring 
in the two women stars. Their 
quick sty le of play and 
infectious enthusiasm would 

Guards Paulette Parker and ... 

FUN FUN! 
EVERY NITE 

make either of them a valuable 
asset lo any team . But 
together, they di play a 
certain type of synergy; the 
duo is much better than the 
individual component. 

The Triton s' offense 
revolves around the pair fast 
breaking and controlling the 
tempo of the game. Their 
defen e i impenetrable. With 
huge center Mary Egan 
looming beneath the basket , 
the two are free to roam 
through the lop of the key 
stealing pass after pass, u ing 
their quickness and court 
ense to guide them_ From the 
tands, it is obvious - to beat 

the Tritons, you must 'Iow the 
game down and keep the ball 
out of the guards' hands. 

U ually a . trong first- half 
team, Freed and Parker play 
the majori ty of the half 
together , ubstituting 
occa ionally with guard 
Valerie Hardie and Brenda 
Sweatt. But late in the second 
half , during many clo e game 
when Coach Malone genses 
the need for a spark, she finds 
t he catalyst in her tandem. As 
with most quality athletes, 
whether college or pro. an 
attitude takes over late in the 
game. Words need not be 
spoken but you can see and feel 
the change. Freed and Parker, 
like the Boston Celtics in their 
last game against the Lakers , 
feel it and take control of the 
final few minutes. 

Parker. a 5'6" freshman. IS 
the team's leading scorer With 
3]9 total points on the year, 
and has s hot a fai r 41 percent 
from the floor and 64 percent 
from the foul line. he is 
second on the list of aSSists, 
behind Freed. with 66 Coach

Malone, referring to the all ·

Parker aid," he definttely IS 
our scoring punch. Tn the 
beginning of the season, 
however, she was only takmg 
even or eight shot s a game. 

but she relaxed and has been 
averaging over fourteen pomt 
a game." 

Wendy Freed, in her last 
year of eligibility, has amassed 
some impres ive stats her elf. 
She leads the team in as ist 

with 78. Averaging over eight 
points a game, she ha~ been 
shootmg an mcredlble 56 
percent from the floor and 65 
percent from the line. Malone 
on Freed said, "Wendy ha~ 
scored less In the la t coupleof 
games but has been playing 
outstanding defense, turning 
over a lot of balls." Most of her 
point come from the fast 
break, "about 75 percent," 
Malone added.

Men, do\Vn to eight players Athletes of the Week 
BY BOB MCSPADDEN 

Senior Staff Writer 
UC San Diego center Mi ke 

Dabasinskas layed in a varied 
array of shots from the inside 
Tue. day night, but his 17 
second-half points were not 
enough to tame the Cougars of 
Azusa Pacific University, who 
went home with a 72·66 
victory , 

The Triton fou~ht with 
APU for the entIre forty 
minute, whittling away at 
the Cougars' eight point 
halfti me advantage but were 
unable to draw closer than 
four points. It was Dabasin-
skas, however, that provided 
the necessary offen ive punch 
when UCSD needed it most. 

With 14·47 remaini ng in the 
duel, guard Tom Wight was 
tagged for his fifth personal 
foul, only t he third time thaL 
ha happened this year. With a 
major part of the Tritons' 
ou t ide scoring threat s itting 
on the bench, head coach John 
Block decided to work against 
the Azusa middle , where 

sop homore foward Jeff 
Robinson stood sentry wtth 
four persona l foul s. 

"We did well against him 
(Robin son) but not well 
enough." Although <lDabo" 
sprea d out the Cougar 
forecourt with an impressive 
mixture of hook shots and 
short jumpers, Robinson held 
his position well and was not 
sent from the game on fouls 
until on ly 15 seco nd s 
remained. He fini hed the 
contest with scoring honor , 
adding 29 points to the Azu a 
cause. 

Azus a clearly held the 
advantage throughout the 
game, while UCSD failed to 
convert a number of Cougar 
mistakes. "We lacked a lot in 
concentration," commented 
Block, "and 100 ing Tommy 
put a lot of pressure on Bob 
(Goodman). He played hard ." 
With hi backcourt partner 
out Goodman directed the 
Triton offense towards the 
middle, while droppi ng in 16 

Guard duo sets the pace 
continued from page 15 

"Together, they have added 
t remendously to our program 
th i year. Their aggressive 
sty le of defen e is a main 
rea on behind our success. 
They are the main thrust 
behind ou r offense," Malone 
continued . "They make the 
other players on the floor play 
harder and with better results. 
The key to an excellent player 

is not only how many points 
they scrore, but how they help 
t he team score." 

The Tritons are 1-4 in 
league play and 8· 17 overall. 
They fini sh their regular 
season with four more games, 
three at home, On Friday, Feb. 
19, they host Cal Lutheran 
College at 5 p.m. at the Triton 
gym. 

points of his own, The short 
point guard also did well at the 
other end of the court, forcing 
opponent Jeff Apana to work 
the ba ll in ide and picking off 
numerous pa ses. 

The Triton go on the road 
tomorrow evening to face 
Southern Calfornia College 
and then return next Monday 
to host Cal Baptist in the final 
home contest of 1982. The 
Tri tons beat bot h teams 
earlier in the year.

Biden on foreign policy 
l 'Olllilllll'd from pa/o!l' .3 
philsophy, said Biden, IS 
causing great problems 10 
many parts of the wor ld , the 
most visi ble being EI Salvador. 
He says that the Admini tra-
tion i overlooking the social. 
politi ca l and economic 
dynamic of the region and has 
focused instead on the problem 
as being primarily a US-Soviet 
confrontation. If one follow 
the logic of this, said Biden, the 
endpoint is a military 
confrontation. 

And , as Biden pointed out, a 
recen t C [A report con firm 
that we cannot win in EI 

alvador unles a large US 
ground force i committed. 
Biden quickly commented , 
however, that he doe not 
believe that congres will 
allow a large scale introduc· 

lion of US troops IOto the 
region. 

enator Biden has, however, 
come up wit home ugge · 
tions of his own to solve the 
problems in EI al\'ador. "We 
should use common sense and 
concentrate on the political 
and economic field rather than 
the military," econdly, aid 
Biden, "we hould u e all of 
our power to force all partie to 
the negotiat ing table," 

Biden feel t hat we mu t 
move quickly to help stablize 
the situation because he 
believes that EI alvador'~ 
President Duarte wi II be 
ousted in the upcoming 
elect ion and that thIS will force 
the US to back the far right. "If 
we are not careful ," satd 
Biden , "the whole regIOn could 
blow up."

THE UCSD LESBIAN AND GAY ORGANIZATION SPEAKS OUT 

I'm not a faggot ... 
I'm a hUfllan being 

Faggot. bent, gay, honlo.'ex ual. are gen rally used 
pejorativ~ly. I have never lik d being labeled with any of 1 hese 
terms. I am not an evil or perv ned queer, but a canng, loving 
hUlllan being with dedI aled parent~ , a warmhearted sIster and 
brother, and loyal friends (most of them 'itraightl. [ha\t~ goal. 
in hfe and I ho I wlil be permitted to contribute to humanitv 
just a~ all oth r people in the free world are I don't resent the 
fact that I \\ III I ad a life not expenenced b~ the majority of 
people on eart h, but I dete. t the fact that some people : tlll 
assume the right to deny others feehng~ and emotions 
emanatmg from their hearts. The"e emotIOns are the greatest 
gift slife ha ' to offer and no one should be depri\ed of them. 

Ever-mce el mentary ~chool I have found myself an 
extremely ,>en~lti\e per~on eager to give and receive affectum. 
A ' I gre\\ older I noticed that I took my relation..,hips with male 

fnt'nd~ much more . eriuu~h than thev did . I kne\\ that mv 
mtere~t m boyS \\'a~ like tliat of mo'>t of the girls I knew.·1 
thought It \\ as IU"l a phase h\ a. gOlOg through. In hIgh school I 
notICed that mo. t I)f my male fnends were talklOg more and 
more about the female anatom\. I could not under..,tand their 
fascinatIOn . I kn w finall} thai I was veD dIfferent from my 
male fn nd ', ~om of \\'hom I was very devoted to. I valued their 
friendshIp: more than is normal. I had girlfriend. whose 
company I 10\ ed , but I knew that hfelong companionship, 
mtimate love and caring, and those Irrational sen ation ', I 
could onl\' share with another male. 

Hanni come to understand myself, I finally admitted that 
m\ feeling ' \\ ere those charactenst IC of a homosexual. I 
current Iy have a gIrlfriend but I have not told her of my 
Inn nermo~t affect ion: I don't \\ ant to tell her because she ha. 
manyexual hang·ups. I tell my"elf, because we are ~o 
congenial and close, were she a man I would be deeply 10 love 
with her; ..,he I'" one of my greatest inspiratIons. 

I have only recent ly re\ealed to other~ m~ romantic 
onental1on Ho\\'e\er, I have told only a few gay fnend. wi th 
whom I trust 111~ mo~t Int imate idea::. and problems The~ \ .. ere 
<t!\\ a\'''' under"tanding during the:-,e first .... tage · of mv "coming 
out." 

\\ hen I fIr t came tl) LA(JO meetll1gs I ,.,.a:-;..,o inselure I used 
an alias; mam of m\ fnends ... till don't kno\\ mv last name or 
\\ here I Il\e i am n'ot proud of my pa:t paranoia. I have been 
tota1\y re·educated about gays and the lives they lead. I am now 
more comfortable \\lith my feeilngs and I have regam ed 
confidence 10 humanity . I have learned to express my love and 
can now apprecia te the supreme t heme of love 10 art and :ong. 
"I am Lazarus come from t he dead to tell you all. I shall tell you 
all. " 

I dId not write thi.., artICle -;olely for LAGO but for the 
hberatlOn of all people trYlOg to understand themselves and 
theIr feelll1gs. EmotIons are integral to being human, and if we 
all came to terms with our 0\\ n and other's emot ions, th \\ orld 
wou ld be a much better place, and the quality of hfe would be 
elevated beyond comparhon.

What is LAGO? 
The Lesbian and Gay 

Organization (LA<;O) IS a 
SOCIal and cultural support 
group for people who identify 
with same·sex relatlOn~h l ps. 
LAGO ~en e: bIsexual men 
and women, people \\'ho are 
un~ure about their se ' uahtv , 
and also Les bians and Gav 
men. The group i~ also geared 
!Ov,:ard educating the public, 
and het elosex'lal j..1lJesb are 
welcome at It.... bu ' lI1es 
meetings, euucational foru m , 
and SOCIal en 'ntl; . 

In the pa"t Lesbians and 
Gay men have be n a large 
minont\ \\ hose needs and 
\ cry t'.'I~tance were o\'erlook· 
ed ." Here ali UL D, by 
nmsen ati\ e e timates, over 
1000 people iden t ify \\ ith 
same·sex relat ionship .. LAGO 
prOVIdes a safe, s upportive, 
and caring climate where 
t he. people can be tota lly 
open WIth themselves and 
theIr peer. Many of LAGO 's 
members think of the group as 
a family . 

The fIrst of LAGO's two 
primary goals is to gl\'e it.... 
member -; a fee ling of 
communit\ , and to affIrm 
their dIgnIty and worth as 
human bemgs in a sOCiety 
whIc h frequent" reduces 
them to-;exual st reotypes and 

oC lell outla h . Those 
members w ho are just 
discov ring t heir homo exual 
nature: are supported, 
advised, and comforted bv 

tho~e member~ who "have 
been there and know what it's 
like." Newcomers are never 
pushed in any particular 
direction for the sake of some 
IXJlitical objective. People are 
encouraged to fi nd out "who 
they really are," and to pur~ue 
a I!fe~t vie w hich will be 
enriching and rewarding for 
them. 

econd, LAGO s trives to 
educate society about the 
importance of integrating 
homosexu als a. respect able,

destroYll1g the anci nt m)- t hs 
and modern stereotypes v. hich

Christian and Gay 
I am hri:tian and I amgay. 
I cho e to be Chri:t ian 

becaus I fe lt God' · love 10 my 
life and I wanted to respond to 
that love. I did not choos to be 
gay . That was a gift from God. 

It was not a gift I wanted , I 
begg d God to tak it away,. to 
make me "normal" I 
st ruggled dai ly to repres'i my 
gay identity, to deny my 
feeling '. I couldn 't be gay! I 
wa. a good boy; I went to 
church everv undav . 

God d sn"t consult us \V h n 
he chooses th gIfts He will 
gi e. With His help I was 
eventually able to accept Hi 
gift wit h than k. , for I came to 
rea lize that being gay and 
being Chri ·tian are not 
contradictory. 

I realize there a re passages 
in Scr ipture which have been 
interpreted to conde mn 
homosexual acts; however, an 
increa. ing numbe r of 

cripture 'chola r: do not 
interpret them that way. T he 
accoun t of the de t ruction of 

odom in Genesis, for 
example, i. oft en interpreted 
by fund amenta list · to de. cri 
God'· utter condemnation of 
ho mosexua lity; however, 
scholars today consider the slO 
of Sod om to be inhospitality, 
not homosexuali ty . 

Pau l, In hi ' fir:t letter to the 
Corinthians, li~ts homosexu· 
a ls as being among those who 
wi ll not enter the Kingdom of 
Heaven - but on ly in some 
tran lati on . In othe r 
translations we find in 'lead of 
homo. exuals , the . ensuou , 
the depraved, or p r on of 
in famous morals. In fact , we 
don't know the meaning of 
the two Greek words Paul 
suppo. edly u 'es to indicate 
homosexual . 

I freely admit that certain 
homosexual a ts are si nfu l, 
just a certain hetero exual 
acts are. urely, no one wou ld 
denv t hat homosexual child 
a bu~ e is equall y a: si nfu I a 
het rosexua l chi ld abuse, 
which i much more common. 
On the ot her hand , how can 
the . exua l celebrat ion of a deep 
love existing between two 

women or two men be smful? 
. urely t.) deny that celebra· 
tion. thaLlove, Isinful. 

I am aware that there are 
good and caring religious 
people, Christ ian and non 
Ch r ist ian, who condemn 
homosexuality as grevious ly 
sinful. I believe their \'J('W' are 
based part lyon ignorance and 
fear. It is a struggle for me to 
respect their beliefs and try to 
educate them when it IS much 
easier to 'ondemn th m in 
return. 

The offIcial teaching of 
many ChristIan Churches 
today dist IOguishes bet we n 
homosexual act s, whIch are 
considered <;Inful, and 
h om 0 sex u a I () r i en tat ion, 
which is con.ldered morally 
neutral. Thus, a gay person is 
not respon. Ible for being gay 
since that is an unchosen 
aspect of her or hi~ 
personality . A gay person, 
ho\,,:ever, does choo e whet her 
to engage in . exual activity, 
and to choose to be act Ive is 
still officially condemned. 

Butevenont he<;infuln s of 
homosexual act I; t here is no 
consensus. One of the first 
\\ omen or dai ned to the 
Episcopal pnesthood, Ellen 
Marie Barrett. IS a I sbian who 
finds her relatIOnship with her 
partner a source of great 
strength. 

In the end it was neither 
modern Scnpture scholarship 
nor my belief. about ~in that 
enabled me to accept both my 
gayne s and my religion . God 
call m to grow, to become 
more fu lly human, more fully 
re ponsive to oth r,. I d cided 
that I cou ld grow more readily 
as a self·accepting gay man 
than as a gay man denying hi" 
identity and pr tending to be 
straight. 

Nole: A number %rganiza-
tions have formed to help 
lesbians and gay men in the 
struggles they may ha!'€ 
reconciling their religioll with 
their gayness. These organiza· 
tions represent nearly ev ry 
deno m inat ion. LA GO has 
in/ormation 0 11 several 0/ the.\e
