Man Reported to Have 
EXPOsed Himself on Campus 
CRIME: A female Pepper Canyon 
reported the incident, which took 
place early on Sunday, Feb. 21 
By Nliou Mostoll . 
Senior Staff Writer 

An unknown man allegedly exposed himself 
to a female resident in Roosevelt college's 
Pepper Canyon apartment complex on Sunday, 
Feb. 21. Police said the man, who was reported 
to have been wearing shorts and a ski mask, was 
seen masturbating by a window near the Pepper 
Canyon area shortly before he exposed himself. 

At 2:30 a.m., the individual allegedly 
knocked on the resident's door. Police said that 
the student, without looking through the peep-
hole, opened her door to find the man on her 
doorstep. exposing himself. 

Police said the victim will not file charges 
against the individual, who has not been caught. 

Roosevelt college Assistant Resident Dean 
Craig Stephenson said the resident's privacy is 
the utmost concern and therefore, not mu<.:h 
information is being released about the incident. 

However, the Residence Life Offke posted a 
flier around the Pepper Canyon complex, which 
slates that students should "keep doors locked 
and usc common sense when answering the 
door." 

UCSD Police Detective Nate Floyd said this 
incident appears to be an isolated case, but he 
said he advises students to report any informa-
tion to the UCSD police by calling 534-HELP. 

Additionally, Floyd said he also cautions stu-
dents not to walk home alone and to call Ihe 
police or their resident advisors if they are <.:on-
fronled with a similar situation.

VOLUME 96. ISSUE 18 

Leventhal 
Vetoes 
Resolution 
DECISION: AS. president says 
he supports reinstatement of 
affinnative action in UC system 
By VIncent Gragnanl 
Senior Staff Writer 

Last week, A.S. President Joe Leventhal 
vetoed a resolution passed last week by the 
A.S. Council thai called for the Univer~ity 
of California (UC) Regents to rescind Iheir 
1995 ban on affirmative action . 

Levenlhal said that while he supports the 
restoration of aflirmative action. he felt that 
the resolution was inaccurate in statement~ 
it made about UC Regent Joanne KO/.hcrg . 

"I dbn't have <.:on<.:erns with the general 
direction of the resolution," Leventhal said. 
"My wncern is that there is information in 
there that is incorre<.:t with respect to Regent 
KOlberg." 

The resolution <.:all~ KO/.berg an "anti -
affirmative aClion appointee" and <.:alb for 
Gov. Gray Davis to "immediately with-
draw" her appointment to the UC Board of 
Regents. 

On<.:e regents arc appointed. they may 
serve for a year before being wntirmed by 
the California State Senate. During that 
year, the governor may rcs<.:ind the nomina-
tion. 

Leventhal said he believes that becau~e 
Kozberg has not made a statement regarding 
her stance on affirmative action, the resolu -
lion passed by the A.S. Coun<.:il is ina<.:<.:u -
rate. 

Leventhal said he received his informa-
tion from UC Student Regent Max 
Espinoza, who visited UCSD last week. 

"From what [Espinoza] told me, nobody 
knows what Regent [appointee I Kozhcrg'~ 
view is on affirmative aClion," Leventhal 
said .. " think it is inappropriate, irrational 
and uneducated to pass a resolution for her 
appointment to be removed based on those 
views." 

Leventhal attempted to discuss his wn-
cerns in an A.S. Council meeting but was 
unable to because the item had been passed 
by the internal committee. In order for the 
council as a whole to discuss an item of leg-
islation or a resolution, such an item musl be 
"pulled" from committee - meaning that 
twu-thirds of the council must vote in favor 
of discussing it. The council voted against 
pulling the resolution from committee. 

Leventhal added that he would support a 
si mi lar resolution if he felt il was a<.:.:urate. 

'" would enthusiastically support a reso-
lution that supports the reinstatement of 
affirmative action if the information in it 
was accurate," Leventhal said. 

A.S. Vice President External Kirk 
Matsuzaki said that he believes Kozberg is 
anti-affirmative action because he wa~

In the article titled "A.S. Council Approves Outreach Plan," the headline was incorrect. A.S. President Joe

to UCSD to learn more about the Center for Research In Educational Equity, Assessment and Teechlnt

Committee first

appointed by former Gov. Pete 
Wilson. 

"Wilson has led the attack on 
affirmative aClllln." Matsu/aki 
said. "He would appoint someone 
who w()uld set tonh his agenda." 

A .S. Vice Pre~ident Internal 
Kim M,Koon said that he believes 
the resolution shuuld not have been 
vetoed. 

"Given that resolutions arc 
merely opinions of the A~soctated 

Studcnt~ at UC San Diego, I don 't 
believe the president of a diverse 
student body should vet() a resolu-
tion Ju~t be,ause a few lines of it 
arc controversial," McKoon said. 

McKoon also ~aid that he 
believes KOlberg ~hould have 
made her positiun on aflirmativc 
action known. 

"As a person advocating acces-
sibility to all people. I feel the A.S. 
[Councill should make bold state-
ments if a cenain regent is being 
besitant on her stance on aftirma-
tive action," McKoon said. 

The resolution ~tates that Davis 
should till the t'our open ~ats (m 
the Board of Regents. as well as 
KOI.berg\ ~eat with affirmative

The resolution also cites a state-
ment by UC Regent William Bagley 
saying that "be will move to rescind 
the UC Regents' July 20, ,1995 han 
on atlirmative action (SP-I and SP-

A.S. Council Demonstrates 
Concern for Student Needs 

Recentl y, the A.S. Council has been responding 
well to students' demands by organ izing many differ-
ent activities for students. From hosting Nobel 
Laureates to encouraging student-run outreach pro-
grams in the community, the A.S. Council has made 
its presence known on campus. 

One of the programs recently unveiled by the 
A.S. Council, the Associated Students Outreach 
Program (ASOP), which consists of an outreach 
database. outreach project~ and outreach scholar-
ships, is an exce llent idea that has the potential to 
use student passion to further the goa l of raising 
the educational standards for under-represented 
minority groups in San Diego. To this end, the A.S. 
Council has a variety of projects in the works, and 
all students are invited to participate. 

Not onl y has th t: A.S. Council given UCSD stu-
dents tht: opportunity to t:ncourage younger stu-
dent~ in their acadt:mic endt:avors. but the counci I 
has also provided students with the opportunity to 
furtht:r their own educa ti on. Through council 
effo rt ~ , three Nobel Laureal\;S havt: been invited to 

~peak on call1pus at no cost to students during the 
months of February and March. The Laureates are: 
1995 Nobel Laureate in Literaturt: St:amus Heaney, 
1998 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry Waltt:r Kohn 
and 1990 obc! Laureate in Economics Harry 
Markowitz. 

The A.S. Council ha~ al~o shown interest in stu-
dent conct:rns regarding the lack of parking spaces on 
campus. Through an A.s.-sponsored Committee on 
Parking and Transportation Issues, which focuses on 
~tudent kedback and input , a dialogue has been 
es tablished with uni'versity officials in order to 
improve the current problem. 

Moreover. the A.S. Council created Triton Tide to 
boo~t sl:hool spirit by encouragi ng attendance at ath-
letic events and even gi ving out free T-shirts. These 
efforh turned out to be a big success. The l:ouncil is 
clearly attempting to change the apathetic feeling that 
students seem to complain constantly about, yet also 

_display toward UCS D. 
Overall, we believe that the A.S. Council has 
~hown ingenuity and enthusiasm in the desire to 
improve the lives of UCSD students, especially at a 
time when student apathy is growing. The Guardian 
commends every member of the A.S. Council for 
thei r time and hard work . We hopt: they continue 
making their presence kit.

PRESIDENT CLINTON SAVES THE 
DAY AS MODERN SUPERHERO 

COMMENI'ARY: 
Clinton struggles with his 
Republican villains in 
comic book style 
By Ward Han 
Staff Writer 

For a while, Ihe media searl:hed for 
a profitable and enlertaining '\uper-
hero" to join Ihe ranh of Superman 
and Batman. They outdid Ihemselves 
when Ihey found Bill Clinton. 

Clinlon lurned oul 10 have every-
thing a superhcro needs: Sexiness, ' 
invincibililY and interesling villains. 
As a result, Ihe media gives Ihi~ super-
hero an excessive amounl of allention 
with tabloid stories, grueling inter-
views and non-stop coverage of his 
"Lois Lane(s)" - making him wish he 
could rei real to Bruce Wayne 's bat 

The media, however, supposedly 
gives Ihc puhlic what il wanls, .md the 
puhlil: is fa~cinaled with Ihe on-going 
~Iory of Bill Clinton the superhero. 

The puhlic likes heroes wilh sex 
appeal. Superman wears lighls thai 
reveal bulging mu~cles. and nalurally, 
women such as Lois Lane want him. 
BOllman also wears tighls thai reveal 
hulging musele~, and women cha~e 
him whi!.: he dlases had guy~. Our 
~uperhero Pre,ident CiinlOn d()e~ nol 
even need light~. women a(e dla~ing 
him anyway. 

Atmml everyone I, lamiliar wilh

puhlicly announced her love for 
Clinton. Thl.! public i~ ~Iill Irying to

Superman w.ars tI-. that r.v.al

rel:enlly been exposed. Hb sex lili: is 
a~ unbelievahle a~ il i, shocking, and it 
lruly belongs in an adull wmic book 
and nowhere else. 

The lovely women whu want our 
\uperhero \ body ~erve a~ a sharp con-
Ira,1 10 the nasty villains who want 
him l:ru~hed. For any superhero to 
have ,upport from Ihe pUhlic, he or.she 

mu~1 have despicable villains. They 
don'l get any more despicahle than the 
RepUblicans - for some unknown 
reason, Ihe right-wing Christian 
Coalilion and racist group members 

just seem to join the RepUblican PariY. 
On more than one occasion, Ihe 
Democrals have blasted Ihe 
Republicans for being hypocrites. 
According to Clinton and Ihe 
Democrats, RepUblicans want to cut 
taxes for the rich and take advantage 
of the poor, minorities and the disad-
vantaged. RepUblicans are accused of 
ahandoning the poor by CUlling wel-
fare. If Clinton and the Democrats are 
right, then the Republicans make "The 
Joker" and 'T~e Penguin" in the 
Batman ~eries look like nice guys. 

However, villains in comic books 
never hurt the hero in the end. In 
much the same way, RepUblicans have 
yet to really cut through Clinton's 
invincible arinor. While each of the 
Republican's episodes to harm the 
president were'interesting to watch, 
they were unable to hurt Clinton, who 
continually fought off the lenacious 
attacks. 

In the "Whitewater" episode, our 
hero escaped blame, but his sidekicks, 
the McDougalls. were the ones sacri-
liced. In the "Filegate" epi~, again, 
our superhero narrowly escaped 
blame. The mysterious suicide of 
Vince Foster (Clinton's former 
'employee) made this episode even 
more fascinating. 

The most exciting episode of 
Clinton's Mory has been the impeach-
ment process. Having failed in Ihe rel-
alively palhetic attempls with 
"Travelgate," "Whitewater" and 
"Filcgate," RepUblicans found kryp-
lonite in Monica Lewinsky, a new 
source of harmful exposure. In this 
mosl rel:enl episode, Clinton's mis-
leading statements ahout Lewinsky 
prompted the usually lethargic 
Republican Congress to impeach him 
rather quickly. This episode is the 
equivalent to the "Dealh of 
Superman" episode in Which 
Superman appeared to have died.

opinions has the capacity 10 offend

Anyone with a ~Irongly held

avoid offending others at all costs, 
the administralion has produced 
the apathy that it is fighting. As 
long as students are afraid to stand 
up for their convictions, lillie 
progress will he made 10 beller Ihis 
campus. Society is huilt on Ihe 
debale of differenl inleresl groups, 
religions and cultures. If studenls 
remain wary of such debate, Ihey 
will remain uninvolved and apa-
thetic, both in their school and in 
society. The good news is that we 
don't have to believe everything 
Ihat the administration tells us. 

Thai may be a stretl:h, bUI I'm 
prelly sure thai that 's whal the 
administration would say. After 
all. a universily.'s job is to educate 
responsible citizens, nol merely 
produce intelligent machines. Our 
administraliun is worried that 
UCSD is churning out a few thou-
sand people a year who are great at 
chemistry, but completely inept as 
members of society. This has led 
to the Great War on Student 
Apathy. 

Unfortunately, except for a few 
Triton Tide T-shirts wandering 
around campus, Ihis campaign has 
produced few results. In general. 
sludents slill don ' ll:are about any-

very high priority, making this 
clear to students with its policies

While I applaud Ihe universi-
ty's attempl to expose students to 
different people and different 
opinions, the administration has 
pursued the issue to the point that 
it is "wrong" to express a belief 
thai might offend'someone else. 
Instead of encourolging diversity 
of thought, such policies produce 
students with few convictions and 
little abllilY or desire 10 do any-

Persunally, anYlhing I feel 
strongly about is not an opinion; 
it's a fact. Therefore, anyone who 
disagrees with me is wrong. As 
harsh as Ihis sounds. it 's fair. 
Anyone can adopl Ihis allitudc. In 
Ihis case, however, relative mural-
ity goes righl oul Ihe window. We 
don 'I have to accept stalic defini-
lions of right and wrong; we can 
believe in one set of values as Ihe 
lrulh. 

Unfortunately, by frowning 
upon the expression of potentially 
offensive ideas, the administration 
has also condemned standing up 
for one's beliefs. As a public uni-
versity, UCSD cannot forbid the 
voicing of most opinions, but it 
has done its best 10 suppress those 
that fall outside the realm of polil-
ical correl:tness.

The blame does not fall only on 
the university officials, but on the 
students themselves. Regardless of 
seminars on tolerance and lectures 
on acceptance, we make our own 

deci~illns. While I don ' l propose 
actively trying to offend every-
body around us, I Ihink that we 
need 10 realize that offending peo-
ple is a risk thai must be taken to 
get things accomplished. 

If we, as a student body of 
very diverse inlerests and opin-
ions, decide to voice these 
beliefs, and support them with 
action, the administration would-
n't be as concerned with student 
apalhy. I think it would be more 
worried about the flow of power 
out of its hands and into the hands 
of the students. That would be a 
good Ihing. I think we can all 
agree on that.

Some people mighl resent the 
media (and this article) for making 
our government's affairs look like 
comic book stories. After all, the 
fables can be childish and exagger-
ated. Then again, the media reports 
whal goes on whelher or not it's 
childish or exaggerated. 

We really have a bizarre, sexy 
and invincible person in the While 
House. He is running our counlry 
with his arch enemies. JUSI like 
characters in a comic hook, neither 
our superhero and his allies, Ihe 
Democrats, nor his enemies can 
tolerate each other, and of course 
they won't work together. If the 
media reported a bipartisan govern-
ment working efficiently together. 
people would accuse the media of 
writing romantic liction. 

But wait, there's still time for a

Social Security 
Need. Tough Loving 
Editor: 

In their article on Social 
Security (,'The NEW New Deal," 
Feb. 22), Jenna Barclay and Brooke 
Garreuson propose the idea that 
social security has failed and should 
be junked. They point to handing 
oul tax breaks as a better way of 
helping people. That is a great idea, 
but almost any tax break invariably 
helps the rich more, without provid-
ing any real extra money to the peo-
ple who arc blue collar workers. 

Barclay and Garrettson write 
about how Americans squander ai L. 
their money. That is . true, yet . 
Barclay and Garreltson claim that a 
tax break will give Americans the 
money they need to invest in a pri-
vate mutual fund . Every post-
Christmas season I read i" the 
paper about how some people spent 
way beyond their means and arc 
now $25,000 in debt. I have also 

COSTA VERDE 
CENTER 

8650 GENESEE AVE. 5u, 220 (619)452-7374 

read that Americans are saving less 
now than they ever have before. 

The money that Barclay and 
Garrettson talk about will be used 
for things needed in the present. not 
the future. Americans spend what 
they have because we want to see 
what we can get with our money. 

Barclay and Garrettson will have 
to change the Al114Irican psyche 
before people from the less well-to-
do sect of American society will 
invest money in the stock market, or 
mutual funds. Social Security may 
need some tough love, but it does 
not need to be destroyed. If Barclay 
and Garreltson believe that destroy-
ing Social Security will help the 
American people they must be 
thinking about a different American 
people. 

Charles Ginsbera 

Truth of ct.Istl_1tJ 
Blinded by MI"e. 
Editor: 

Let me stan with a disclaimer. 
Despite the fact that I am writing in 
response to Simone Santini's anicle 
("Biblical Interpretations Obey 
Social Prescriptions," Feb. 25), I do 
not want to be seen a~ a religious 
militant. I do not hate homo:.cxuals, 
women who have had abonions or 
people of other r,eligious groups. I 
respect the rights of other people to 
hold opinions I do not agree with. 

I am, however, one of a number 
of people at UCSD who base our ' 
lives - our entire lives - on the 
principles found in the Bible and I 
am writin'g to correct some of the 
ideas expre!tSed about us in 
Santini 's article. 

I suppose the easiest way 10 start 
is to correct a few of the statements 
Santini makes that are Just mistak-
en: I. The Bible does NOT say 
"God hates homosexuals" (that's 
an imponant one) but rather claims 
that he loves ALL people. 2. 
Catholics are not forced by doc-
trine to agree with everything the 
pope says. In fact, he very rarely 
speaks Ex Cathedra. 3. Many peo-
ple do believe that God exists "in 
the same way physicists believe the 
electron exists." 

You can see what kind of pic-
ture would be painted of Christians 
if these errors were not corrected

- that they are hateful people who 
rely on their religious leaders to do 
their thinking for them and believe 
in a nebulous God. 

Now the point'! want to make is 
this; Santini said "taking up the 
Bible's morality should not be 
taken lightly." This is an excellent 
point. I, like the majority of 
Christians, would NEVER base my 
life on a set of principles as all-
encompassing as those of the Bible 
without serious thought. 

Santini asks what kind of 
thought goes into a decision to 
"believe in the Bible." This is an 
excellent question. My belief in the 
truth of the Bible's teaching is based 
on the results of careful research 
into its historical accuracy. an in-
depth examination of the claims of 
science and of other religions. and 
an exhausting inner search. 

But the standard goes both 
ways. If it is imponantto give seri-
ous thought to the Bible's teachings 
before accepting them, it is also 
imponant to give serious thought to 
the Bible's code of morality (or any 
widely held code of morality) 
before rejecting it. The misconcep-
tions Santini has about Christianity 
are widely held and have Icd many 
people to reject the Bible. 
Cenainly, they have every right to 
choose what they believe about the 
Bible, but it would be wise to lind 
out first what it really teaches. 

Santini's anicle contains another 
common mistake. He condemns 
Christianity for having caused the 
"crusades, inquisition. witch hunts." 
Certainly. people who call them-
selves Chrislians have committed 
such crimes, and I approve of 
Santini's attempt 10 remind 
Chri~lians that their religion too can 
be abused. But then, the violence of 
the crusades is hardly lhe 
Christianity taughl by Jesus, who 
commanded them even to "Love 
your enemies." I lind that many 
people discount the Bible's claims 
because they have had bad experi-
ences with Christians. Christians 
have a very mixed track 1'e(..'ORi. And 
yes, many Christian are just plain 
obnoxious. But that is not adequate 
grounds ror rejecting Christianity. 
t:hristianity. remember. is not aboul 
Christians, but about Christ.

FREE BEATS FOR HIP-HOP HEADS BEFORE FINALS 
Taking a break from the Hill tour, Grammy nominee Outkast will perform at the Price Center tonight for free 
By David Drisc:oIl 
Staff Writer 

Thur~day at ~p. m ., Outkast will 
take time off opening for Lauryn 
Hill to play UCSD's Prit:e Ccntl!r. 
Students will have a chance to hear 
the prestigiou,. Atlanta-hascd 
group perform its uniquc blend of 
southern-soul and hip-hop for a 
vcry small prit:e: nothing. 

In five short years, Big Boi and 
Drc have come a long way from 
Atlanta's Tri -City high schuol 
where Outkast first came tugether. 

Just before graduation, the two 
sigiled a deal with LaFace records 
and began their musical careers in 
1994 w'hen they released SOl/thern-
/J/aya/isticadillacmu:ik. The album 
was a huge success and the single 
"Player's Ball" stayed at number 
one on the Billboard rap chart for 
six weeks. Their sewnd album, 
ATLienJ. went platinum in a few 
weeks aftcr dehuting at number 
two on the Billhoard Top 200. With 
their successful hackgruund , it 
should be no surprise that Outkast's 
most recent release Aql/emini has 
res;eivcd enurmous amounts of 
excitement and praise. 

Their Grammy nominated sin-
gle "RoS<l Parks" dominated radio 
air play while the word spread 
about the qualit~ of Big Boi and 
Dre 's latest effort. The album is 
flawless as it Ilows smoothly from 
beginning to end. With Aql/emini. 
Outkast bring together 16 tracks 
that other artists could only dream 
of composing. The strong beats in 
"Skew it on the Bar-B" have the 
potential to rock the Price Center 
down to its feeble foundation, 
while the mellow chorus of 
"Slump" should have thousands of

"Then they brought you ATLiens, 
Platinum plus. Now Big Boi and 
Dre, the player and the poet, bring 
you their highly anticipated third 
album, Aquemini, destined to be at 
least Double Platinum." 

The boys in Outkast predicted 
high record sales for Aql/emini 
though they probably never pre-
dicted a Grammy nomination and 

the immense amount of praise from 
the critics that they have received. 
From magazines to National Public 
Radio, Aql/elllini has been dubbed 
the best album of the year. 

The player and the poet should 
deliver a performance that will 
leave San Diego students longing 
for more, and demanding it. The 
appeal of their music has caught on 

across the country, and tonight it 
should catch on here. However, 
don ' t expect a show full of 
pyrotechnics and explosions as 
Outkast are about the music. 

Dre sums it up best in his musit: 
when he says, "Don' t get caught up 
in the appearance. It 's Oll1kast 
Aql/elllini, another black experi -
ence."

Roots: Things Fall Apart will be the fourth album released by The Roots , 
incorporating fundamental Hip-hop with experimental jazz movements . 

THE ROOTS OF HIP-HOP 
Innovative rap group mix a powerfUl beat and message 
By Slant Gee 
Staff W(/fer 

Maintaining our lradilion here al the 
Gllardiall for honoring qualily music, lhe 
instrumental Hip-hop scene has bcen deserv-
ing of our respect lately. wilh strong albums 
released from lhe likes oflhe Black Eyed Peas 
and now velerans of lhe jazz/hip-hop fusion 
movement , The Roots. Firsl formed in 
Philadelphia back in 1987. The ROOIS have 
long bcen one of lhe mosl dynamic.: and hard-
hilting groups in hip-hop. 

Comprised of heralded Iyricisl Black 
Thought and sidekick Malik B. drummer 
?uestlove. bassist Hub. keyboardisl Kamal. 
and inhuman beat-box eXlraordinaire Rahzel 
"The Godfather of Noyze," the band made its 
major label dehul in 1995 with Do You Want 
MIIIT' 1!!! 1 1! (DGC), followed by iIIudelph 
halflife the next year. These leaders of the 
instrumental hip-hop scene. whose new 
album ligures 10 be their best one to date. will 
invade San Diego on March 7 when they play 
at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach with 

. special guest Common. 
Not only have they taken on the improvi-

sational nature of progressi ve jazz culture. 
they have incorporated il into their live 
show. Seeing The Roots perform live. il is 
stanlingly easy to conjure up images of how 
this movement began: A dark basemen I in 
Philly somewhere in the hean of the hip-hop 
subculture. the scent of a blunt in lhe air. the 
overwhelming need to bob one's head 10 the 
wicked drumbeals, alllhe while atlempling 
10 breathe in the intricately patterned poelry 
slicing through the smoky atmosphere. II is 
precisely the appeal of the pure vibe of 
musicians who do it for Ihe music firsl. and 
not for the cliches associated wilh main-
stream hip-hop. that endears one to this 
band. 

Tllings f"all Apart, lhe new album from 
The Roots, fealures an work as powerful as ils 
music. The album will be released in a limit-
ed edilion collector's series of five separate 
album covers. TirillRs Fall Apan. which 
draws its title from lhe Nigerian Chinua 
Achebe's classic.: 1958 novel (which in lurn 
got its name from the famous poem ''The Sec-
ond Coming" by W. B. Yeals) arrived in slores 
this Tuesday. 

Five stark black-and-whitc pholographs 
grace the covers of the limiled edition press-
ing. One is the famous image of a savagely 
burned toddler shonly after a World War II 
bombing of Shanghai, China; anolher shows 

oUl-of-conlrol NYPD office rs pursuing 
African American cilizens during ' a race riol 
in lhe Bedford Sluyvesanl seclio~ of Brook-
lyn; yet anolher is lhe close-up of lhe oul-
sln.:lched h~nd of New York underworld fig-
ure Giuseppi "Joe The Boss" Massari ShOl 
dead Wilh lhe Ace of Spades in hand; lhe 
fourth shows lhe inlerior of a gUlled church 
destroyed by fire; and rounding oul the covers 
is lhe haunting face of a slarving Somalia 
child. 

While the political messages cut sharply, 
il is the music lhal will endure. Contempo-
rary hip-hop albums have been structured 
around commercial hits. bUl this album 
slands as a complele a work as each of The 
Roots previous albums have. The intoxical-
ing drumbeats provided by ?uestlove and the 
vocal oddities provided by Scratch and 
Razhel layered under the intelligently pat-
terned and hard-hitting rhymes of Black 
Thought and Malik B. combined to make 
145 songs that were narrowed down to the 
17 used on the album. II is precisely Ihis 
musical surrounding thaI sets this album 
aside from contemporary attempts at chart 
dominance. 

Uniquely patterned and styled, this album 
is truly about the music - and critical 
acclaim has been all-encompassing. from 
Rolling Stone to Tire Source. Still, the Philly 
crew is more interested in leaching by exam-
ple ralher than being overly critical. The 
inlrospective atmospherics. "where arc we 
going" rhymes, funky live inslrumenlation (as 
usual) and guest appearances by Common, 
Mos Del' and 'Eryka Badu (among olhers) 
teaches plenty. "We thoughl the smanesl 
thing to do was to celebrate lrue hip-hop as 
opposed to just saying. 'Shil'S fucked up," 
said ·!uestlove. 

If Hip-hop world 's tumultuous c.:Iimale has 
taughl its fans anything, it's that there are few 
safe bets in rap music. Bul while fashion 
trends, dance crazes and groups old and new 
each arrive and depart with relalive quick-
ness. The Roots continue 10 infecliously 
groove to the beal of a vaslly different drum-
mer. With their fourth album, lhese emcees 
and vocal manipulators steadfastly resume 
their role as one of hip-hop's mOSl innovali vc 
outfits.

Punkabilly Invasion 
,-,..,-

-** 
A band ahernating ~ountry licks 

and distorted power chords ... No. 
it 's not more new Metallica. it's the 
Barnyard Bailers' latest tasteless 
effort. PilI/kahil/.\' Illvasion. The 
recent popular resurgence of punk 
and ro~kabilly swing have 
spawned a sick-and-twisted but 
fun-lovin' bastard genre named 
psychobilly (a.k.a. punkabilly) 
whose uncles happen to be eddie 
munster and Mongo from "Blazing 
Saddle~ ." 

The Bailers consist of Rich 
Stahlhut tor lead vocab-, Rob Kwait 
on guitar and bass. and Rick SlOjak 
Oil the drums. Spccial guest lonny 
Bowler on bas, Iini,hes off this 
hack ward hand. 

Lyrically, Pllllkabil/y IIII'asilln 
wvers the redneck gamut, from 
bestiality to masturbation to Ics-
bians to Appalachian proponions 
of drinking and drugs. and every-
thing in hetween, all set to twangy, 
heavy guitars and an upright bass. 
Though the Bailers probably won't 
he up for a Grammy any Jime soon. 
they are a pretty fun band if you 
don 't take them (or yourself) too 
seriously. 

Although for some reason 
punkabilly happens to be much 
higger in Europe. thc'e hedonis-
tic hillbillies are from right here 
in San Diego. So, if you're up for 
an out-of-the ordinary live show 
and an! NOT AT ALL offended 
hy this line from one of their 
tamer tunes ("Silicone City"). go 
I.:heck them out: "They may' not 
be real/It may be a sinrro me it 's 
pari of the bodyllf it 's underneath 
the skinll like big tillies real 
good."

They have bleached hair and 

several piercings. They wear tats 
on their arms and Amettes on their 
faces . They play punk I.:ombined 
with clements of rock. Or is it rock 
with elements of punk'! 

Local boys Furious IV chum out 
riffs and lyrics ("They say I'm 
throwing my life away" from 
"Crutch") just furious enough to 
snag gigs opening for the likes of 
Pivit and Bad Religion, hut not 
quite furious enough to scare off 
the ladics. The irony is that the 
hand 's emharrassingly gcneril.: 
tune, are ' more than mqderatel y 
popular in this city prccisely 
hecause of their run-of-the-mill 
aggressive quality. Until the next 
big thing breaks. San Diegans will 
be cheerleading their own wntri-
but ions to the punk/rock/ska-
core/techno/swing scene. . 

The quanet loses points for its 
lack of originality, but that doesn't 
necessarily mean it plays bad 
music - the album is cenainly tol-
erable. even pleasant the lirst few 
times around (despite that constant 
nagging feeling of deja vu), it's just 
that there's really nothing here that 
compels thc listener to hear any of 
these tracks again. The singles 
don't stand out above the other 
tracks - in fact, aftcr about 15 
minutes, What 's BeCllme (~f tile 
Bahy stans sounding like onc real-
ly long song with constantly recur-
ring tempos and guitar tones, with-
out any real ~hange in dynamics. 

The produl.:tion quality may 
suck on the record, and maybe 
they ' re capable of distinguishing 
themselves from the herds in a live 
setting.

Drum & Bass Strip to the Bone 

--
-*** 

Sly and Robbie's newest 
release. Drum & Bass Strip 10 the 
Bone by Howie B, is a funktified, 
hip-hopped take on reggae and dub 
by the masters themselves. 

Lowell "Sly" Dunbar (drums, 
percussion) and Robert Shake· 
speare (bass), bener known as the 
Riddim Twins, have been bringing 
intelligent, sophisticated reggae 
and dub to America and Europe for 
nearly 25 years. This new efl'on is 
up to par and then some. 

Producer. remixer and compos-
er Howie B was one of the drivins 
forces in Skylah and has released 
three solo albums. 

Drum & BaJs Strip to the Bone 
is a somewhat misleading title for 
those who are expecting frenzied 
jungle phrases. Sly and Robbie's 
take on drum'n'bass is a bit closer 
to the original source. Modern 
jungle and drum'n'bass emerged 
as a mixture of sped· up break beat 
and hip-hop in conjunction with 
the sparse (and significantly slow-
er) drum'n'bass genre from reg-
gae roots. Stril' til the Bone is 
more lamaican drum'n'bass than 
it is Metalheadz or Urban 
Takeover. 

But Stril1 to the Bone is by no 
means unoriginal. Synthesizer 
blurps and intricate drum 
sequences make the album visceral 
and strange with a solid groove. 
Although similar in concept to the 
Brian Eno and lah Wobble project 
Spinller and a bit repetitive in 
places. Sly and Robbie put heavy 
dub bass lines over hip-hop and 
funk loops with an electronically 
tcxtured background to create a 
well-worth-your-time album.

40 Seasons The Best Skid Row 

--
-•• 

Here's the greatest hits package 
from Skid Row - one that'll make 
you feel old. in case you don't 
already. They're all here - "18 
and Life," "I Remember You," 
"Quicksand Jesus," etc., along with 
some irrelevant live and rare mate-
rial for good measure. Don't deny 
it - you know you loved perfect-
ing your air guitar to these rockin' 
classics. 

This disc didn't earn either of 
its stars for its shameless over-
the-top guitar solos, gagging 
lyrics or pelvis-thrusting glam 
anthems. 

Rath~r, this album earned its 
stars purely for its late ' 8Ost early 
'90s "blast from the past" nostalgia 
value: for reminding you of 100.3 
Pirate Radio; of that girl you used 
to make out with in eighth grade; of 
your first beer; of that Sebastian 
Bach poster you had up in your 
room all through junior high. Well. 
it is nothing to be ashamed of -
Bach was, after all, posterboy of 
the "Youth Gone Wild," of which 
we were all members. If you would 
like to feel young again, pull out 
the old posters and air guitar 
accompaniment. Rock on.

AFRICA: 
Muslc is a mystery 
filled with promise 
CHI •• d"..,... 10 
xylophone. Makubuya both 
exposed and reinforced the stereo-
types that plague non-western 
music. The temptation to congre-
gate foreign music into fallaciuus 
categuries is often ' difficult 10 
resist. Howevcr, by comparing his 
technique on the East African 
madinda With that employed by 
Diallo on the similar West African 
halafon. Makubuya established the 
very real distinctions that exist 
hetween these cultural traditions. 
Diallo played with the head or the 
mallets flat on the keys, whereas 
Makuhya played the keys ' edges on 
his insliulnent. The timbre in thi~ 
technique was much warmer, with 
less attack. As an instrument based 
on improvised variations of a 
theme. Makuhya kept hi s melodic 
Interplay short and expreSSive, 
Icaving the audience hungry for 
more during intermission. 

Taking the stage with a somber 
gate, Hakmoun. whosc face often 
disappeared behind a junglc of 
dreadlocks. enticed the audience 
into an emotional rivcr. The Gnawa 
style of southern Morocco, 
sonorous within a spiritual context, 
did not lend itself to the hUlTlor that 
Ilavored the Iirst two African Trou-
badours. because the music is the 
product of synergy between musi -
cian and instrument in a healing 
trance. 

"My instrument is my friend," 
said Hakmoun of his three-string 
sintir. which he made himself. 

The bass guitar amp used by 
Hakmoun. with four 12" speakers 
and one Ill" speakcr. not only 
needcd compression to handle the 
dynamics of the sintir, but also 
hinted at the duality of Hakmoun 
as a performer. Though he plays 
traditional music. he lives in New 
York and records with western 
anists such as Peter Gabriel and 
Paula Cole. with whom he 
involves himself in exploring the 
combination of different traditions 
into music greater than the sum of 
its pans. 

In a conversation after the con-
cen, Hakmoun said that "music 
isn ' t about speaking English ... 
let's all be closer together." Hak-
moun succeeded in bringing the

audience closer together wit h the 
investment both he and the listener 
gave the music. Each accelerando 
funher disguised the beat that all 
could teel. yet could not locate 
within the music. One had to give 
oneself over to the music or be left 
behind in confusion. 

Later. he critiqued a lot of mod-
cm music as missing the perfor-
mance aspects of dance, but. during 
his performance. Hakmoun was the 
opposite, using the bells attached to 
his feet to create a dance rhythm 
that worked in juxtaposition with 
his playing. It was not dancing, so 
much as it was conversation in 
movement. His voice. wet with 
emotion. poured from his soul. not 
from his lungs. 

Diallo and his djembe joined 
Hakmoun for one of the last songs 
of the night, a ferocious amalgama-
tion of marauding rhythm and soul-
wrenching vocals. Though not 
knowing the subject matter of the 
lyrics left some wanting. the inten-
sity was so blistering as to leave the 
audience feeling parched. Imagin-

The UCSD Guardi.n 

ing renowned funk bassiSl Victor 
Wooten on a three·day caffeine 
bender playing all-out with every 
drumming powerhouse who has 
ever laid down a groove for Jamcs 
Brown would not even approach an 
understanding of what it was like to 
see Diallo and Hakll10un in action. 
Hakmoun put down his sintir, opt-
ing for hand-held ancestors of mod-
ern hi-hat cymbals, when 
Makubuya contributed to the finale 
on his madinda. 

The encore offered a great sum-
mation of the diversity presented 
as well as the exhilaration of see-
ing the fantastic byproduct of an 
unnatural comhination of tradi -
tions from Africa. Hakmoun 
thanked the audience as he was 
"happy 10 share thc moment and 
the music with Ithe audience I," 
having lost his father two week> 
earlier. Through the thick 't:loud of 
rhythms from Diallo on his djcmbe 
and Hakmoun on his sintir, a ccle-
hration of life reverherated through 
the auditorium. with Makuhuya 's 
shaking bells dancing acro,s it .. II. 
When the music stopped. a pres-
ence hung in the air, fading only 
when the echoc, released the audi -
ence mcmhers from their plca~ing 
rapture. stirring as if awakening 
from a faVOrite dream. 

As tcchnicians scurried to coil 
cahles and pack instruments, Hak-
moun took time to reflect upon the 
evening. 

"1 know myself. I have no lim-
its," he said. "Anything is possihle 
... if you helieve in yourself." 

Looking into the rllture, he 
added. ''There is a d3y when every-
thing will he even. Iwhen all music 
will havc an audience I." However. 
he cautioned. "Don't rush ... you've 
got to make yourself happy lirst, to 
make others happy." 

After a night of establishing the 
identities of three regions of their 
homeland, the African Troubadours 
reveled in the singularity or their 
mission. bringing a message of 
music as an aOirmation of individ-
uality and as a way to hring every-
body together. Without becoming a 
Western cliche of Africa on display, 
Hakmoun. Diallo and Makubuya 
cooled the tires of misconception 
with a rain storm whose thunder 
rumbled with understanding and 
acceptance. The future of music is a 
mystery filled with promise. As 
Diallo put it, "It's all about the 
mind ... relax ". and it is there."

The Tritons were able to adapt 
their game and found ways to pene-
trate the tough Leopard hlock in the 
third game. tallying 24 kills and 
only II hitting errors. But the 
Leopards stayed to their game plan 
and put in another impressive per-
formance in the third game, totaling 
21 kills and only 7 hitting errors. 

The Tritons were again led on 
offense by their two middle block-
ers Devon Jetl'coat and Bill Sioclair. 
Jeftcoat had a team high 15 kills 
and also led the team in digs with 
seven. Sinclair was the Triton's 
most efficient hitter, totaling 12 
kills and only 5 hitting errors while 
also contributing 2 block assists and 
4 digs. The fact that neither player 
committed a service error was a big 
factor in the Tritons' improved 
serving in this match. Serving has 
been an Achilles heel for UCSD all 
season, but the team only commit-
ted 8 errors on Saturday. Though 
they served better, the serves did 
not yield a win.

went four and two-thirds while 
surrendering 6 runs on 7 hits. 

The steadiness which charac-
lerized UCSO relief pilt.:hing dur-
ing the Hayward series also did 
nOI show itself yesterday. James 
Sanders took over for Beaven in 
the middle of the fifth inning alier 
Chapman had scored 5 runs. With 
2 outs in the fifth. shortstop Bobby 

Calderon swred on a passed hall 
to make it 6-0 going into the 
Triton sixth. A Triton error 
allowed Calderon to get on hase 
once again in the seventh. Another 
UCSO mishap - a passed hall -
gave Calderon second base, who 
was douhled in by the next bailer. 
Brian Hinson replaccd Sanders, 
giving up 2 singles and a triple 
during Ihe ' rest of the seventh 
inning to make the swre 10-0. 

The hasehall leam must now 
prepare for this weekend's huge 
series against Montclair State. The 
"key mistakes" which O'Brien

were not us critical in the loss yes-
terday. However. in tight ball-
games, such mistakes can make or 
hreak a team's record. 

Hilling-wise, UCSD should 
just retum to what ha~ been work-
ing all along. As long as the meat 
of the order keeps rolling, then the 
Tritons should be tough to over-
wme. Furthermore. the coaches 
and players believe that the spirit 
to win is present. Unleashing that 
spirit and combining it with the 
team 's proven maturity to over-
come defeats will produce a win-
ning formula. 

There's no doubt that the 
Tritons will have forgotten about 
Wednesday's loss and will be 
pumped for this weekend's 
matchup versus Montclair State. 

Tritons players said they were 
disappointed with their latest loss.

more Zack Hite said. "They basi-

I ______ -----------------~ 

The UCSD ice hockey team is 
treasuring the sweet taste of 
revenge after dominating Cal 
Tech last weekend. After a disap-
pointing loss to the northern 
squid a few weeks ago, UCSD 
benefited from the rematch, easily 
beating. its opponents 5-1. 

GoaIlceeper Jessica Barr may 
have been the difference in the 
team's two performances. Given a 
chance 10 play, Barr has shone 
brightly in net. The game against 

Cal Tech was Barr's second con-
secutive stan and her second 
COIIICCUtiVC win. For her effOlts, 
BIrr was helped on offense by 
Ollen Gervey, who started the 
scorilll on a breakaway loal 
assisted by Chris Davis and 
Noby ltakura. Gervey was the 
ICIdini point ~rer for UCSD 
with 2 goals and I assist. Reid 
Hankins, Erik ~orman and 

Andreas Larsson also scored for 
UCSD while Chris Davis added 
two assists. 

With the win, UCSD is unbeat-
en in their last 4 games with 2 
wins and 2 ties. With only 3 
games remaining, the leam must 
put in a strong performance to 
solidify their status as a playoff 
team. UCSD's next game is for 
San Diego hockey supremacy 
apinst rival San Diego SIIIC. The 
IIIIICh will be played at the San 
Diego Sports Arena this Saturday 
It 12:15 p.m.

Despite popular belief, danc-

ing is a ve.,ry athletic activity .. 
Even without all those drinks, a 
wild night of dancing in TIjuana 
can be very taxing on your body 
- especially on your legs. 

It's safe to say that the UCSD 
dance team wasn't drinking or 
gambling in Las Vegas on 
Saturday, Feb. 20 before the USA 
National Dance Competition. It 
was the first time that UCSD has 
participated in the event, but the 
team didn't have a problem pump-
ing up the crowd. Yet, teams from 
University of Arizona, University 
of Colorado and University of 
Oregon kept UCSD from earning a 
place in the finals. All in all, the 
dance team represented UCSD 
very well and are already looking 
forward to next year, when they 
can compete with the confidence 
of seasoned veterans.

Game 11'10 wa~ a com-

pletely di fferent slory as Ihe 
Lancers hegan to dig Ihe Triton 
allacks. The Triton~. who seemed 
so in control in the tirst game, all of 
Ihe ~udden l:ouldn 't put shots away, 
a lactor Ihal was the deciding factor 
in Ihe 11 - 15 loss in game 11'10. The 
Lancers hil a .129 in the second 
gamc. the exacl same percenlage as 
in game one. bUI Ihe Triwns hil for 
only a .057 as opposed to .379 in 
Ihe first game. 

Game three was more of the 
~amc as the Trilons continued to 
have trouhle on offense. The only 
difference was that Ihe Triton 
defenst: t hal had played well so far 
in Ihe match began to let them 
down. Tht: Lancers. who lacked 
offensively carlyon, began putting 
everYlhing away. The TrilOns man-
aged to make it respectable, but Ihe 
Lancers really dominaled the 
game's play and eventually went on 
to win 15-7. The Tritons again hit a 
.057, hUI Ihe Lanl:ers 10laled 17 
kill, and only 7 errors to hit .313. 

Game four wa, a classic 

LIMITED 

SEATING -

matl:hup, as both teams hit extreme-
ly well. After 28 points in the game, 
the score was locked at 14 each.1lle 
Tritons then lurned up their game to 
anolher level and managed to win 
Ihe next two points and win the 
game 16- 14. The Triton, had 27 
kills in the game and only commit-
led 9 errors, while the Lancer~ were 
equally il1lpre~sl ve on ol1cnsc, lally-
ing 26 kills and only ~ emIrs. 

In game live tht: rult:s ~hanged 
10 rally scoring, at whi~h the 
Lancers apparently ex~el. Cal 
Baplist had ils best hilling game of 
Ihe match . II committed only one 
hilling error against II kills, rolling 
10 a IS-8 viclory in the game and a 
3-2 victory in the match. 

The Tritons were led by Bill 
Sinclair and Devon Jefli:oal. The 
Triton middle blockers lallied 17 
kills apiece and each commilled 
only 3 hilling errors. 

This loss hrought the Triton's 
record on the year to 2-13, hUlthey 
are slill ranked Ihird in Division III 
and may yet go to the playoffs. 

In the previous match against 
La V~rne . the Tritons did what Ihey 
have heen nutorious for Ihis sea-
son: They came out slow in the 
early going. They were unahle to 
pUI points away and had lrouhlc 
hilling around a lCIugh Leopards 
block. UCSD's hilling ineflicien-
cies wert: the main factor in their 9-
15 game one loss. The Tritons man-
aged 15 ki lis bUI also had 13 hitting 
errors, while the Leopards had 20 
kills and only 4 hitting errors. La

Block CItJ: Setter Kurt Seckington and middle blocker Devon 
Jeffcoat have been solid for UCSD this season, but losses mount. 
Vt:rne's efficient attack in game 
one would continue to he a motif 
throughout the match. 

In the second game, the Tritons 
hit hcner and the Leopards didn't hit 
as well , but this dillcrence didn't 
show up on the scoreboard, as the 
Tritons lost the second game, 6-IS. 

Again, the Tritons were unable to 
put away crucial shots at key pOints 
during the game, and La Veme's 
block seemed to nullify the Triton 
allack. UCSD totaled 17 kills in 
game two, while La Verne continued

lost hccause some unnamed graduate had

instead of gelling in, the RIMAC gestapo

a different story, however - Bouchey lost 
them both 3-6 to lose the match: 

"I really played tight in the second and 
third set," Bouchey said. "The shots just 
weren't falling lor me." 

No. 6 singles wa.~ possibly the biggest 
heartbreak for the Tritons, as Miller lost in 
three very tight sets. Miller. like many of the 
other Tritons, came out red-hot in 'the lirst set, 
winning 4-6. He lost the second set by the 
same scort', and played to a live-to-live 
standstill in the third set before losing his 
serve. Miller went on to lose the set 7-S, and 
the match 1-2. 

The four losses in singles werc 100 much

Tritons lost the match 3-4 and ran their record 
10 2-5 on the sea.~on. 

"At one point, we needed to win one of tht: 
three matches left on the court to win the 
match, but we lost them all," Bouchey said. 
"If we keep up our intensity, matches like this 
will begin to fall our way." 

The Tritons' next match is Sunday at 10 
a.m. at the UCSD North Courts against 
Radlord College. After that, UCSD takes on 
arch-enemy Redlands University in a match 
that will likely clear up the western regional 
playoff picture.

My vow to not work out forgotten, I 

immediately began to play in my usual style: 
like this was the 7th game of the NBA linals 
(people ask me why I try so hard and all I can 
say is what else do I have to do'!). Using my 
sweet hands and enormous girth, I had just 
positioned myself in the low post and drawn 
a foul when the RIMAC spy showed up look-
ing lor me. 

Threatening to stop the game, he made me 
go upstairs where I proceeded to haggle with 
the crazy people that guard the turnstiles on 
whether or not I was a student. Apparently 
writing for the Guardian was not enough for 
these lunatics. I was forced to go upstairs to 
my favorite depanment of all. the Intnlmural 
department where SA (and the newly-named 
Guardian sports department's bachelor of the 
year) Ahmad Russ graciously lent me the five 
dollars lowed the nazis and I returned to the 
game; just another reason why I love the 1M 
department.

wa~ the freshman, Emma Kudritzki , 
who waded through the Aggie 
defense and slotted thl~ game-winner. 

It was a great win for the Tritons, 
defeating the No. 6 team in the 
nation justilied UCSD's earlier frus-
tration at their No. 13 ranking, a spot 
they kit wa, a low ranking for thl!m. 

The nl!xt mat.:h for UCSD was

Stanford showed the Tr~ons why 
they arc onl! of the top t.:ams in th.: 
country. as they proved to he hig-
ger and fast.:r than Harper 's hunch. 
The Tritons fought hard, hut an 8-0 
run from the Cardinal was too 
mu.:h to handle and Stanford 
auiscd to an 11-3 win. 

With u big win and a big loss 
behind them, the Tritons got into 
the pool against San Jose State. 
The Spartans arc another top-10 
squad who quickly found out that 
UCSD is not to he taken lightly.

SHY: UCSD loses to Villanova 4-3 despite sweeping doubles matches 
By Bill Burger 
Semor Scaff Wnrer 

sweeping all three prosets to win the 
lone doubles point. At No. I doubles. 
Steve Shabcl and Joe Zcrhoni played 
a solid match. holding off two strong 
opponents to win 8-5. At No. 2 dou-

A, the saying goes, being close 
only counts in horseshoes and hand 
grenades. After last Tuesday 's 
match, the men ', tennis team 
came to full y appreciate 

bles, Graeme Bou.:hey and 
Brian Crain played a 

tough proset that eventu-
ally went to a tie-

_ r~NNI.1 breaker, in which 
thl! ml!aning of this say-
ing - games don 't 
come much closer 
than the team 's .:hal-
knge against Di vision 
I Villanova University. 
At one point, the Tritons 
,eemed to have the match under 
w ntrol , but Villanova fought back, 
eventually handing UCSD a 3-4 

l os~ . 
UCSD had a good day in doubles, 

Bouchey and Crain 
lought the temptation 

to play tight and eventual-
ly came out on top 7-4, taking 

the proset 1)-8. 
No. 3 doubles was anot~r close 

proset as Kai Miller and Mike 
Rosell took on Villanova's Ramon 
Prats and Josh Schofield. Miller 

and Rosell held off the Villanova 
team by one break of serve, win-
ning thl! mat.:h 8-6. 

"We really .:ame out firing," 
Bouchey said of his team 's doubles 
play. "We lost the doubles point 
against Claremont [College), and 
that is something that we shouldn't 
do very often." 

With the doubles portion in 
hand, the Tritons took to singles 
play on an emotional high and full 
of confidence. This confidence was 
obvious early on in singles, but the 
Tritons were unable to maintain 
that intensity throughout their sin-
gles matehups.
