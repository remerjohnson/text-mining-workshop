Stelnem Visits UCSD to Rally 
Women for the Vote 
Students encouraged to vote pro-choice and Democrat 
., LAllA MOle ... 
Contributing News Writer 

Feminist activist Gloria Steinem, 
Congressional candidate Susan Davis and State 
Assembly candidate Christine Kehoe rallied 
before students in the Price Center Thesday 
afternoon in support of abortion rights and to 
persuade students to band together and 
approach the polls on election day. 

The three keynote speakers, welcomed by 
the Associated Students, addressed a diverse 
spectrum of issues including the status of 
reproductive rights, gay and lesbian rights and 
the need for health care in America. However, 
all speakers emphasized the necessity of the 
student vote in defending reproductive rights. 

Kehoe stressed this point by saying, "I'm 
here today because your vote matters, because 
every single vote counts ... Roe v. Wade is 
hanging by a thread. Equal rights and choice 
hangs in the balance." 

Steinem, president of the Washington, 

D.C.-based political action committee Voters 
for Choice and its Student Mobilization 
Project, is touring college campuses through-
out the nation urging students to "take control 
of your own lives and vote,· in response to 
what Steinem called the "tactic of chipping 
away at abortion rights to the point where 85 
percent of women, especially the poor, don't 
have access to abortion and where abortion 
clinics have a hard time finding a landlord." 

Davis also stressed the vital role students 
an.d young voters must play in determining the 
outcome ofthe Nov. 7 elections and urged stu-
dents not to remain passive while their older 
counterparts speak their minds at the polls. 

"Students cannot let those over SO decide 
the outcome of this election. They have much 
to contribute and they can swing an election." 
Davis said. 

Davis emphasized the power students have 
to influence highly competitive elections.

UCGoes 
Against Grain 
with Low Fees 
Report shows quality of 
education remains high 
while tuition stays stable 
By MARGARET O'NEIU 
Contribut ing News Writer 

The University of California is bucking a 
national trend by not raising fees for the 
sixth consecutive year, according to a survey 
released Monday by the College Board. 

Nationwide, fees and tuition increased an 
average of $148 (or 4.4 percent) at public 
four-year universities for the 2000-2001 
academic year. The UC system failed to 
increase its mandatory fees for the sixth year 
in a row. 

Eighteen million dollars of the state's 
$100 billion budget was designated by the 
governor and the legislature to public uni-
versities to avoid an increase in tuition for 
this year. 

According to another survey by the 
National Association of State Universities 
and ,Land-Grant Colleges, the systemwide 
fees for UC undergraduates plus the average 
campus-imposed fees averaged $3,964. This 
is more than $1,200, or 23 percent, below 
the average of the public universities sur-
veyed ($5 ,243). For graduate students, UC 
costs averaged $4,747, which is $2,100 or 30 
percent below the comparison group's aver-
age of $6,887. 

Due to additional state funding, UC fees 
for resident undergraduates decreased a 
total of 10 percent since 1998, and fees for 
graduate students decreased five percent 
since 1999. 

"The College Board figures point out the 
fact that the University of California contin-
ues to provide a superior education at 
extremely low fees because of the generosity 
of the governor, the Legislature and the peo-
ple of California," UC President Richard C. 
Atkinson said. 

The NASULGC survey found only eight 
other land-grant universities which did not 
raise fees for the 2000-2001 school year. The

A.S. Tries to Make Cost'Survey More Effective 
Financial aid does not rise to match increase in La Jolla's cost of living 
By KAnI NMlL 
Contributing News Writer 

Despite the increaSing cost of 
off-campus housing, the financial 
aid available to offset these addi-
tional expenses for UCSD stu-
dents has remained the same. 

"Financial aid is obviously not 
meeting the needs of students on 
this campus." said A.S. President 
Doc Khaleghi, "The cost of living 
in this area is increasing dramati-
cally every year." 

Khaleghi said that although 
university statistics demonstrate 
that rent has increased 20 percent 
over the last three years. the prices 
are higher than stated. , 

"Rents are going up at least 10 
percent each year." he said. "That's 
at least a 30 percent increase." 

Student Financial Services and 
the A.S. Council attribute the lack 
of increased financial aid to the lack 
of convincing evidence that the 
cost of living for students has dra-
matir.ally increased. Surveys con-
ducted by the University of 
California Office of the President 
assess all financial aspects of a stu-
dent's lift, including transportation, 
parental contribution and housing. 

While the surveys are designed 
to best determine who needs 
money and how much is needed, 
Khaleghi stated in a report that the 
high cost of, living in San Diego 

distorts the results, as more stu-
dents are forced to live together, 
thereby decreasing the rent per 
person in the apartment. 

"Three people are living now 
where two used to live: Khaleghi 
stated. "Statistics have definitely 
shown that [the number of] room-
mates are going up." 

Vincent DeAnda, director of 
financial aid at UCSD, said that 
financial aid has increased to meet 
the needs of students based on the 
findings of the reports. 

"We do some local adjusting: 
he said. "The survey indicated an 
increase [in students' living 
expensesl . We try hard to fill all 
students needs. Resources have to 

be spread out as costs go up." 
DeAnda also said that one-third 

of all tuition goes back to financial 
aid. However, the high costs of liv-
ing in and around La Jolla have 
forced many students to compen-
sate by converting a garage into a 
bedroom or moving farther away 
from campus. Rental prices listed 
on StudentLink average out to $830 
per month per bedroom, or $430 
per month for those who share. 

"People are having to make a 
longer commute to campus each 
day to get to school," Khaleghi 
said. "The lack of money is forCing 
UCSD to become more of a com-

BRIEFLY 
School of Medicine Receives Grant 

UCSD will receive $1.1 million over three 
years from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention to establish a ~National Academic 
Center of Excellence on Youth Violence." UCSD 
was one of 10 COlleges and universities nation-
wide selected as a center for youth violence pre-
vention, a prograni for which Congress autho-
rized an expenditure in the 2000 budget. 

University researchers, physicians and com-
munity groups will unite to develop programs 
that address the dire public health problems of 
youth violence, which is among the top five rea-
sons for the death of young people aged 1 to 24. 

The Center will help focus on creating and 
implementing community response plans, train-
ing health care professionals and conducting 
pilot projects to evaluate effective interventions 
in youth violence. 

City Heights will be one targeted area. 
Participating faculty come from San Diego State 
University, California State University and the 
Children's Hospital and Health Center. 

In addition to the UCSD Center, centers will 
also be established at Virginia Commonwealth 
University; UC Riverside; University of Puerto 
Rico and University of Michigan. . 

UC and Coalition of University 
Employ ....... otlate 

The lJniversity of California. and the 
Coalition of University Employees recently made 
negotiations regarding the working and wage 
conditions of university employees. The differ-
ences nave been narrowed to issues regarding 
wages and background checks. Both parties have 
agreed to having a mediator at tneir next meet-
ing, which will take place on Oct. 24 and 25. 

Points of the Un iversity'S offer include a 3 .5 
percent across-tile-board range adjustment, 
retroactive to Oct. 1, 1999 and a 0. 8 percent 
across-the-board range adjustment (formerly the 
Incentive Award Program FUllding), retroactive 
to June 6, 2000. 

As a result of thiS proposal, career employees 

ERRATA 

with a satisfactory performance rating or bener 
could expect to receive an 8.5 percent to 13.4 
percent compounded wage increase. C.U.E. has 
also agreed to the University'S proposal to recog-
nize Nov. 10,2000 (Veteran's Day) as a new UC 
holiday. 

Secretary Richardson 
eccepta recommendations 

On Thesday Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
accepted the recommendations of National 
Security Administrator John Gordon for improv-
ing security and other facility operations at UC- I 
operated Los Alamos National Laboratory and 
the Lawrence Livennore National Laboratory. 

As a result of the recommendations, which 
were requested by Richardson on June 30, 
Gordon has been authorized to restructure the 
department's current contracts with UC to 
address security and management issues. UC's 
contract to operate the laboratories will expire on 
Sept. 30, 2002, but a result of the restructuring, 
could be extended for another 3 years. 

The first wave of recommended improve-
ments include creating a vice president for labo-
ratory management with the authority to estab-
lish operational and management standards and 
bringing in subcontractor experts in security, 
facility operations and project and construction 
management to support the lab directors in 
making overall security policy and operational 
improvements.

Rally: 
Abortion is an important 
issue in the electWn 
ContInued from ..... 1 

"In this county, 21,000 votes 
decides who controls Congress -
and how many votes do we have on 
campus?" Davis said. 

All three speakers noted that 
the status of reproductive rights 
will be highly influenced by the 
newly elected president'S ability to 
appoint conservative or liberal 
Supreme Court justices as the need 
arises. 

Steinem, while reading her top 
ten reasons why one should not 
vote for Ralph Nader in place of AI 
Gore, touched on this point: "Do 
we want on our conscience the 
appointment of one, two, three or 
four new Supreme Court justices 
that take away from reproductive 
freedom and that will be with us for 
the rest of their natural lives and 
possibly our natorallives as well?" 

Steinem and Davis spoke about 
the danger posed by anti-abortion 
activists apd emphasized the need 
for personal choice and individual 
reflection in terms of reproductive 
rights. 

"It shoutd not be up to the leg-
islature to make a decision I regard-
ing abortionl: said Davis. "The 
people who advocate getting the 
government out of our lives are the 
same ones who will try to make 
that personal decision. Do you 
want someone else making the 
decision when it affects your 
daughter?" 

Steinem concurs that, should 
Bush win the election and appoint 
conservative Supreme Court jus-
tices, reproductive rights would be 
severely eroded. 

~We can't trust Bush on life-
and-death issues," Steinem said. "If

and courd endorse the Human Life

To Steinem, the term "repro-
ductive freedom" signifies equilib-
rium between the needs of the 
mother and the child. 

~Reproductive freedom 

includes the right to have a child 
and the right not to have a child," 
Steinem said. ~A woman's life is

Israelis Deliver Unjust 
Blows to Innocent 
Palestinian Citizens 

A serious blow to the latest round of 
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks came last 
Thursday when a Palestinian mob beat and 
fatally stabbed two Israeli soldiers at a police 
station in Gaza City. 

In retaliation, the Israeli government 
deployed helicopter gunships that rocketed 
targets in Gaza City and Ramallah, injuring 
about 16 Palestinians. 

It is the opinion of the Guardian that 
although the murder of the two soldiers was 
an unspeakable act of cruelty, the Israeli 
government's rash retaliation to the atrocity 
was extremely disproportionate and 
destructive to the struggling peace process. 

Besides escalating tensions in the area to 
almost the breaking point, all these attacks 
served to accomplish was censoring the 
Palestinians' radio waves by destroying a 
radio transmitter, and to reduce their ability 
to fight crime in their cities by demolishing 
two police stations. Such purely inflamma-
tory acts that do not accomplish any objec-
tive except revenge are exactly what perpet-
uate the violence in the Middle E"ast. 

We at the Guardian feel that by bombing 
Palestinian cities for the actions of a few, the 
Israeli government cast aside justice and 
due process for more violence. 

Were the tables turned and a Jewish mob 
attacked two Palestinian soldiers in Te[ Aviv, 
the Israeli government would certainly con-
sider Palestinians shooting missiles into the 
city purely an act of war. 

We commend Israeli and Palestinian 
leaders for resuming talks and verbally 
agreeing to a cease-fire. We sincerely hope 
this is a step toward lasting peace. 

However, Israel's use of violence against 
Gaza City and Ramallah was purely retalia-
tory, and it is th\! position of the Guardian 
that world leaders should keep out of the 
business of revenge.

Future Supreme Court Decisions Will Be 
Affected by Next President's Views 

Landmark decisions may be overturned if voters don't understand the 
important implications of who they vote for in the executive office 

By VALDII MJ .... 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

John Paul Stevens is 80 years old. Not 
many of his generation will approach 
such an age of grandeur. Although his 
age is extraordinary by itself, John Paul 
Stevens is no ordinary man. He is the 
leader of the liberal justices on the U.S. 
Supreme Court and the most prolific 
court writer when it comes to liberal 
opinions. 

Although liberals nationwide would 
like to befieve that Stevens will live to 
make many more ground-breaking votes 
on the Supreme Coun, reality looks to 
end his ' rhenomenal run as such an 
influentia liberal justice. 

The disappearance of just one justice 
from the court would have a tremendous 
affect on its decisions. The court has a 
delicate 5-4 conservative majority right 
now. Of the 73 decisions it made in the 
last year, 20 were made with this majori-
ty vote. 

The disappearance of just one liberal 
justice would leave the conservative 
majority of 5-3, and leave it up to the 
president to nominate a new justice. 

Justice Stevens is not the only justice 
in danger of leaving the bench. With 
eight of nine judges older than 60, the 
longevity of the court's current players 
looks discouraging. 

It is obvious that the futu~ president, 
be it Gov. George W. Bush, Vice 
President AI Gore or even Ralph Nader, 
will nominate one or maybe two justices 
to the Supreme Coun during his first 
term. That could either make the current 
court wildly conservative or mildly liber-
al. 

Gore and Bush have botlh said that 
they would nominate moderates on 
either side of the spectrum. Moderates, 
though, still tend to stick to their par-
ties. In essence, this is where it will be 
easiest to distinguish between the can-

An Uncertain Future 
New President cannot eradicate century old 
tensions between Serbs and Ethnic Albanians 
By EDWU 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

It appears that a year after 
bombing Siobodan Milosevic out of 
Kosovo, the United States can 
rejoice because Milosevic's own 
people have forced him out of 
office. 

The will of the people has not 
only been expressed in the ballot 
box, but confirmed on the streets; 
what is largely seen as a corrupt and 
self-serving government has been 
dragged down. 

With Milosevic's departure, con-
gratulations seem in order for the 
Western democracies of NATO, 
whose bombing of Serbia last year 
apparently precipitated the rising of 
the opposition against Milosevic's 
regime. 

Some questions still remain. 
Can the world truly break into a 
round of self-congratulations so 
soon? Can one man make such a 
difference in a country, where their 
entire attitude toward the world is 
going to change overnight? Most 
importantly, can Americans believe 
that the success in Yugoslavia 
should frame U.S. foreign policy for 
the foreseeable future? 

On the surface, it seems that all 
has concluded well in Serbia. [n 
many ways, it truly has. [f a govern-
ment in any country, refuses to 
accept the legitimacy of the ballot 
box, there can be no legitimacy to 
that regime. This is a founding prin-
ciple of our own country, and a 
good model to countries worldwide 
that have adopted a democratic sys-
tem of government. 

However, it is a clear mistake to 
automatically assume a nondemoc-

ratic government does not reflect 
the will of the people. This error of 
logic creates an atmosphere where 
both the American media and U.S. 
foreign policy focus on demonizing 
a particular dictator in a country 
whose policies we do not enjoy in 
order to slJppress the fact that, per-
haps, a majority of the ci tizens of 
that pariah state in fact support 
those policies. 

[n preaching the ideal of 
"democratic peace," it is impossible 
for the U.S. media or government 
to characterize an enemy country as 
also reflecting the current will of its 
people. 

Evidence for this sort of U.S. 
foreign policy abounds in a great 
number of situations: We place 
blame for the actions of Iraq on 
Saddam Hussein, the actions of the 
North Vietnamese on Ho Chi 
Minh, and lastly, the actions of 
Germany on Adolf Hitler. 

The truth is that all of these dic-
tators enjoyed support within their 
countries at some time. Men will-
ingly went to war to fight and die 
for the policies that each of these 
dictatorships created. 

While in times of low populari-
ty, they certainly could not have 
been displaced nearly as easily as 
the elites of democratic countries, 
but even if these men derived their 
power and popularity from inflam-
ing belligerent passions, there were 
still belligerent passions within the 
populace to inflame in the first 
place. 

Milosevic lost out because, 
unlike Saddam Hussein . who still 
has the Kurds to pick on, NATO

III-Conceived State Program Segregates Children Courts: 
President appoints future 
Supreme Court j~ Billingual program overlooks importance of preserving culture and identity 

By ANDItIW ILACKMOIII 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

At the opening of the 2000-
2001 school year, a new program 
was forced upon elementary, sec-
ondary and high schools by the 
California Department of 
Education called Structured 
English Immersion. 

Contrary to the name of the 
program, SEI does not immerse 
students in English, but rather 
hinders their progress in and 
motivation for learning the lan-
guage by placing students of the 
same ethnic group together in a 
classroom. 

SEI is precisely the kind of 
bilingual education program that 
our schools need to avoid. Instead 
of integrating non-English speak-
ing students into the mainstteam 
language and culture, schools are 
allowing the students' own native 
c\Jlture to handicap their educa-
tion . 

With the exception of class-
room situations, most Hispanic 
children are not exposed to the 
English language. Spanish is spo-
ken in the students' neighbor-
hoods and homes, and now that 
SEI has been implemented, it is 
spoken in the classroom as well. 

As a result of this, these stu-
dents are also much less likely to 
intertwine themselves into the 
mainstream during recess and 
other extracurricular times. How 
can we claim to be preparing our 
students for life in an English-
speaking culture if we hold their 
hands and do not force them to 
learn the language? 

The purpose of education in 
any culture is to bring forth pro-
ductive, responsible citizens; a feat 

Thinking about applying to 
sriduate or professional 
school, but not sure which 
direction to takel Our Fair is 
the perfect opportunity to 
explore your optionsl 

that in this day and age is not pos-
sible without fluency in English 
beginning at a reasonably, early 
age. 

Even though fluency in 
English is the main goal of bilin-
gual education, the original cul-
tures and languages of these stu-
dents should not be forgotten . 
They are valuable tools that will 
carry them through life in such a 
diverse society. 

It has been shown that the 
knowledge and learning skills that 
children receive through their first 

isolated incidents where students 
were withdrawn from bilingual 
classes. The letter further pointed 
out that SEI .separates students 
"both linguistically and ethnically· 
for the "majorityw of the day. 

America should not be a place 
where many cultures exist inde-
pendently together; it should be a 
place' where many cultures come 
together as one. 

The opposite extreme of SEI is 
actual immersion into mainstream 
classrooms without any special 
treatment. While it is certainly true 

Even though fluency in English is the main goal of 
bilingual education, the original cultures and 
languages of these children should not be forgotten. 
language help them to be more 
successful when studying their 
second language. However. the 
place to cultivate the first language 
is in the home; classroom time 
should be reserved for immersion 
into the second language. 

Surely the families and friends 
of these students will give them all 
the cultural education they need 
without interfering with the 
scholastic educational process. 

Recently, the editors of this 
paper received a letter' from a 
"frustrated· bilingual elementary 
school teacher concerning this 
issue. The teacher referred to S EI 
as "unethical, wrong, and back-
ward. W promoting "alienation" 
among ethnic groups. 

This teacher felt that an anony-
mous letter would be the best way 
to express his opinion on this 
issue, because there is not much 
paren t support except for a few 

that many people have succeeded 
in America without any help from 
outside sources. it is not fair to ask 
this of the majority of the non-
English speaking population. 

With a society that is so cultur-
ally diverse, it is easy to find a 
niche where it is not necessary to 
speak English. Ethnic groups tend 
to cluster, giving them shelter 
against the society at large. 
Without a need for communica-
tion in English, many people sim-
ply lack the initiative to learn 
English by choice. This is where 
bilingual education becomes nec-
essary; but in what form? 

Although the SEI program 
seems to have no redeeming qual-
ities, other forms of bilingual edu-
cation, particularly those imple-
mented in San Diego schools 
prior to this year, have proved suc-
cessful and necessary. 

The anonymous teacher used 

Garrison Elementary School as an 
example of a system of bilingual 
education that helped to integrate 
non-English speaking students 
into the greater student popula-
tion. 

Until the mandate to follow the 
guidelines of SEI, about 80 per-
cent of Garrison's Hispanic popu-
lation was English-speaking and 
20 percent non-English speaking. 

In Garrison's classes, no special 
treatment was given to the non-
English speakers with the excep-
tion of peer assistance and the 
occasional aid of teachers wbo 
happened to be bilin&ual. English 
was tau$ht outside regular classes . 
in spectal English as a Second 
Language classes that were 
offered in addition to regular 
coursework. The program was 
successful in teaching English as 
well as integrating these Spanish-

s~king students into the main-
stream student body. 

The U.S. Office of Bilingual 
Education and Minority 
Languages Affairs stated that the 
aim of bilingual education is to 
"ensure equal access to education 
and to promote educational excel-
lence for limited English profi-
cient learners." This creed seems 
in line with the previous bilingual 
programs, .but SEI seems to run 
contrary to all it stands for. 

Why, then, was a successful 
program replaced by one referred 
to as "backward" by those teach-
ing it? The answer is purely polit-
ical; a response to a lawsuit filed in 
the Office of Civil Rights in June. 

One angry mother who didn 't 
like the system fell that the whole 
thing needed to be scrapped and

forget that. It is an intricate part of 
the checks and balances system set 
up by the forefathers of our greal 
country. 

Supreme Court justices are 
appointed by the president and 
their nominations are approved by 
the Senate. Once in office, they are 
there for life or until retirement. 
The Supreme Court has the power 
to make laws passed by Congress 
and signed by the president uncon-
stitutional. The Supreme Court did 
this last year with the federal law 
passed to curb the sale of cigarettes 
to minors. 

The Supreme Court has long 
been overlooked as a reason for 
picking a president. If any presi-
dential election year would have a 
significant effect on the Supreme 
Court makeup, this would be the 
year. An aging court, along with 
issues such as gay rights, states' 
rights, and abortion rights in dan-
ger of being curbed. makes this 
year's presidential election 
ext",mely important.

CeIItI ..... ".. ..... . 

took his scapegoats, the Kosovars. 
under its wing. This frame thaI 
the Western world has placed on 
the Yugoslavia situation has creat-
ed the illusion that the passing of 
Milosevic's power will also mean 
the passing of troubles in Eastern 
Europe. 

As soon as Milosevic fell from 
power. the United States praised 
the fall of the dictator and moved 
to remove trade embargos, slowly 
withdrawing NATO forces from 
Kosovo and providing emergency 
funding for Serbian infrastructure 
projects. 

It is one thing to try and 
rebuild the devastated 
economies of the area by 
reopening them to the world's 
market. After all, peace, democ-
racy and prosperity go hand in 
hand. But it is quite another to 
assume that the situation has 
changed so radically that we can 
start withdrawing troops and 
rebuilding ' infrastructure with 
Western capital. 

The dangerous thing for the 
American public and the U.S. for-
eign policy officials to ass.ume is 
that with the end of Mllosevlc 
comes the end of years of ethnic 
cleansing. conflict and war. 

The new president Vojislav 
Kostunica, has stated that one of 
his aims is to "reestablish 
Serbian sovereignty over 
Kosovo." In addition, Kostinuca 
refuses to actively pursue war 
criminals and he. ' Iike most 
Serbs, is quite resentful of the 
bombing of his country by out-
side forces. 

Kostinuca, regardless of whal 
the Wesl would like to believe. is 
subject to the political influences 

that put him in power. His sup-
porters were also bombed by 
NATO and have a history of 
being virulently nationalist. 

Those nationalist flames were 
fanned by Milosevic in his bid to 
reassert Serbian sovereignty over 
Yugoslavia, but the core hatred of 
a decade of conflict remains, 
which is why to let down the 
guard simply because of the pass-
ing of Milosevic is pure folly .. 

Allied troops need to remain a 
strong and present force in 
Kosovo for a long time to come to 
assist not only the rebuilding of 
the infrastructure of thaI area, but 
also to prevent Serbs, whether 
they be the political elite or the 
masses, frQm attacking the 
autonomy of the Kosovars. 

Secondly. any . aid to Serbia 
should be monitored to prevent 
partial buildup of a military 
industrial complex, to prevent 
increases in salaries of govern-
ment workers, and to watch 
plants with minor contracts .t~ the 
Serbian military for SUSpICIOUS 
activity. 

This suggestion may seem 
obvious, but it is all too easy to 
convert a civilian industrial com-
plex to a military one, given the 
correct factors and inputs. 

While the Marshall Plan may 
have provided millions in aid 10 
our former enemies, it did not 
mean that we did not stipulate on 
what lerms they had to rebuild 
their countries. 

This brings about the final , 
more longterm solution to 
Serbian aggression: an almost 
utter lack of trust in the inten-
tions of the Serbians, even as 
Western democracies try to stabi-
lize the region in the long term. 

Kostinuca, and the Serb~ as a 
whole, must be watched closely 
because, as mentioned before. 
nalionalist passions and the 
desire for revenge do not pass 
with the passing of one dictator.

It is trl.l(, though; that the vot-

was somewhat slow in accomplish-

A series of smaller changes !Tlay

Perhaps, then. remedial steps 
should be considered until a better

to apply a tourniquet to the

clamp down on incitement

ments. Even as it was being 
announced, some Palestinians in 
the West Bank were protesting 
that Arafat, who left Egypt quickly 
to return to Gaza, had been rail-
roaded into accepting watered-
down compromises on his key 
demands. 

"We have made important 
commitments here today against 
the backdrop of tragedy and cri-
sis," Clinton said. "We should 
have no illusions about the diffi-
culties ahead." 

In a sign of their deteriorated 
relationship, the two sides made 

no commitments directly to each 
other. Nor did they put anything 
in writing. 

Rather, the Israelis and the 
Palestinians both made separate 
verbal promises to the 
Americans, who will act as bro-
ker, policeman and judge of their 
behavior. 

Clinton said on Thesday that 
the Israelis and Palestinians had 
agreed to make unequivocal pub-
lic calls for an end of violence as a 
kind of reveille trumpeting the 
start of the truce. 

After he arrived home, Barak 
issued a statement, saying that he 
had instructed security forces to 
carry out the agreement and work 
jointly with their American and 
Palestinian counte'l'arts. 

Returning to Gau, Arafat 
made a brief statement that 
reserved judgment on the agree- . 
ment. 'The most important thing 
is implementation and we expect 
an honest and accurate one,· he

Seven Major Compani~s Agree to Cut 
Their Greenhouse-Gas Emissions 

DuPont, Shell, Akan 
Aluminium and four other large 
companies Tuesday joined a 
growing list of businesses com-
mitting themselves to substantial 
voluntary reductions in releases of 
heat-trapping greenhouse gases. 

The companies said they 
would seek the cuts in a partner-
ship with Environmental Defense, 
a private environmental group, 
which would give technical advice 

. and publish audited inventories of 
the companies' emissions of the 
gases, which scientists say appear 
to be contributing to a potentially 
harmful global warming trend. 

If the cuts are achieved, by 
201 0 th~ companies' annual 
emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases would be 
15 percent below levels measured 
in 1990. The total amount would 
be 90 million tons a year, said Fred 
Krupp, the executive director of 
Environmental Defense. 

"These are companies, unlike 
others, that are committing to 
hard caps on their total emissions 
all over the world," Krupp said 
Tuesday. "They don't have to, yet 
they're making a commitment to 
slim down and keep the weight 

off." 
The moves, company repre-

sentatives and environmentalists 
said, represent a spreading aware-
ness in industry that emissions of 
greenhouse gases are eventually 
going to be restricted under an . 
international climate treaty or by 
regulations in individual coun-
tries, with Europe, particularly, 

"These are companies, 
unlike others, that are 
committing to hard caps 
on their total emissions 
all over the world." 

- Fred Krapp 
Director of Environmental 

Defense 

already moving toward requiring 
reductions in the gases. 

The other companies that 
pledged to cuts under agreements 
with Environmental Defense were 
BP, formerly known as BP Amoco, 
which had already been actively 
cutting its emissions; Suncor 
Energy, a Canadian company; 

Pechiney, a French aluminum 
manufacturer; and Ontario Power 
Generation. 

Philip E. Clapp, the president 
of the National Environmental 
Trust, a private Washington group 
that has been lobbying for an 
international climate treaty, said 
the companies were "making the 
appropriate management decision 
that it makes sense to start incor-
porating these reductions into 
their costs now rather than having 
to do them suddenly when there's 
a treaty in force and a law in 
place." 

The companies hope they will 
be able to get credit for the reduc-
tions under planned trading 
'schemes allowing businesses that 

. cut emissions beyond targets to 
sell credits to others that cannot 
make similar cuts as cheaply. 

The program constitutes a 
small-scale version of such a trad-
ing system, participants said. 
Besides setting goals for the seven 
companies, the agreement allows 
them to buy and sell credits 
gained for making cuts beyond 
their targets.

Carnahan's Death Casts Shadow Pr8sidantial and Senate Races 
ST. LOUIS - The death of 

Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri in 
a plane crash Monday night has 
thrown the already tumultuous 
politics of this important swing 
state into disarray and probably 
diminished the Democrats' 
chances of recapturing the Senate 
this year, Democrats and political 
analysts said Tuesday. 

Carnahan, a Democrat and two-
term governor, died when a small 
two-engine plane that was carrying 
him to a campaign event in south-
ern Missouri crashed in a h~vily 
wooded area near St. Louis. 
Carnahan's eldest son, Roger, who 
was piloting the plane, and a cam-

paign aide, ChI is Sifford, also died. 
The governor, who was 66, was 

locked in one of the tightest and 
most closely watched Senate races 
in the country, challenging Sen. 
John Ashcroft , a first-term 
Republican who had been gover-
nor just before Carnahan . The two 
men were widely considered the 
pre-eminent leaders of theIr state 
parties and the most popular politi-
cians in the' state. 

Carnahan's death not only 
makes it highly likely that Ashcroft 
will be re-elected, analysts said, but

Review: ~~~rnm~ 
By DAVID LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

Dr. T and the Women 

Director: Robert Altman 
Cast: Richard Gere. Helen Hunt. 
Farrah Fawcett. Lara Oern and 
Liv Tyler 

F 
The thought of Richard Gere as 

a gynecologist is not funny. Proc-
tologist - funny. Veterinarian -
funnier. But, "Dr. T and the 
Women" defies any semblance of 
being funny, off-beat, quirky. feel-
good or any other label you can 
~nd in the thesaurus. The only 
mterestlng element to this film is 
wondering what type of relation-
ship screenwriter Anne Rapp, who 
also wrote "Cookie's Fortune," 
might have had (or is still having) 
with her gyno. 

The main premise to "Dr. T" 
r~volves around a Dallas gynecolo-
gist (Gere) and his exploits with the 
various assortment of women coo-
ing and cawing for his attention. 
From his needy daughters (Tara 
Reid and Kate Hudson) to the 
plethora of rich, overdressed 
ho~sewive~ who can't wait to get 
their legs mto the stirrups, Dr. T 
must try to find his Tibetan tran-
quillity in a world where life 
revolves around his penis. 

The supporting cast of Helen 
Hunt, who plays a canny golf pro, 
Gere's ditzy wife, Farrah Fawcett 
and a bewildered Liv Tyler is dis-
mally utilized compared to the full 
potential their acting would have 

provided (with Hunt at least). 
again. due to a terribly weak script. 
Alas. Robert Altman also fails in 
miserable splendor with typical 
angles and altogether lackluster 
shots. throwing in a naked body 
(Fawcett) in true Altman fashion . 
Nothing is dynamic or quaint 
about "Dr. T and the Women" even 
with a blitzkrieg of the Hollywood 
elite on the marquee. The only 
worthwhile conclusions this film 
incurred after viewing was that: 1. 
Altman should go back to film 
school; 2. Gere should go ~ack to 
Tibet; 3. Rapp should go see her 
therapist.

give their best, to put their arms 
around and encourage. I hope I can 
do the same: 

Jones began his dance training 
at the State University of New York 
at Binghamton. There. he .got the 
foundation for his career by per-
forming and choreographing, and 
met his lifelong love and collabora-
tor, Arnie Zane. 

The two performed nationally 
and internationally before forming 
their multicultural 

more spiritual notion of life and 
work: 

That is great. The man is 48 and 
still using his body to its full poten-
tial. He has challenged the status 
quo, lost loved ones and faced 
death , and is only the stronger for 
it. Wow. 

The man is also extremely elo-
quent. 

"Bill T. jones is very articulate 
verbally as well as physically: said 
Sally Picciolto, who has now seen 
many of his works. "Actually, I'm 
just as excited to see his lecture on 
Saturday as 1 am to see his perfor-

speak personally, 1 have looked 

over his book of 
dance company, 
the Bill T.

in 1982. 

Zane was from 
the Bronx and of

is black and of 
Christian upbring-

them not only 

memoirs titled 
"Last Night on

published in 1995. 
It is purely honest 
and poetic: 

"Our partner-

relationships and 
homosexuality together, but they 
also created some of the most mov-

time. They spent 17 years together 
until Zane died of AIDS in 1988. 
Jones himself is HIV positive. 

"Any person who is dt:aling 
with a life-threatening illness 
becomes more serious and more 
light at the same time: Jones said. 
"HIV is a very, very complicated 
test to see what we 're made of. We 
are judging ourselves now, but we 
will be judged in the future. How 
did we handle marginal people? 

. How did we respond to the .ever-

The UCSD Guardian 

1998, 
The company's work has often 

been described as a fusion of 
dance and theater, modem and 
post modern. Jones is well known 
for his ability to mix strenuous 
technical dancing with pedestrian 
movement. The company's reper-
toire of over 50 works has been 
performed in 30 countries and 
over 100 American 
cities. jones has 
earned too

awards 

o 

count, 
One of 

the most interesting 
qualities of this dance company is 
the diversity of its dancers. They 
are tall and short, large and small, 
dark and light. The dancers come 
from such different backgrounds 
that they inhabit their bodies 
almost as if they are from different 
dancing planets. 

The result is a feast for the eyes 
- to watch how physicality itself 
can say so many different things. 
jones knows that dance is a visual 
art with the added element of time. 
Bodies are beautiful when in 
motion. 

. "1 continue to try to cultivate a 
company as varied as 1 can with 
people of all sizes and shapes and 
colors. r don't think so much 
about what gender two people are 
when they are dancing together. 
Sometimes it's shocking to other 
people. But for me, I've been liv-
ing this most of my adult sexual 
life. "

kinds of diversity issues through-
out his career. He has walked the

line between saying something with move-
ment and "just moving." He has addressed 
minorities' needs for cultural acceptance and 
the movement of an articulate spine. Accord-
ing to jones, however, these two aspects of art 
are not exclusive. 

"Most people don't want art to be chal-
lenging. If it's dance, they want it to be pret-
ty," said jones. "If it's drama, it's supposed to 
be melodrama and the good guys should win. 
Anything that questions religion or sexuality 
is suspect. 

"Art challenges people to contemplate the

SI)! plays a New York gangland enforcer 
who goes back to his hometown of Seattle for 
his brother's funeral. When Carter finds out 
his brother was murdered, he sets out for 
revenge: This simple story plot. was a key 
component to the original's cold and crisp 
cinematic style. In Hodge's rendition, Carter 
was a silent machine that drew the audience 
with hypnotic silences and strategic long 
takes, shifting all the menace into Caine's cal-
culating eyes. The original Carter was a snake. 
Kay and Stallone have transformed the beast 
into a water buffalo with an anention deficit 
disorder. 

It's like watching Rambo in a suit; Stallone 
doing with his fists what Caine did with a 
glare. This is "complemented" by overused, 
ultra-fast crosscuts that sometimes make the 
film seem more like a Hype Williams video 
than a gangland classic. And the generic 
metal/rap soundtrack puts the commercial 
cherry on top. To make things even more dif-
ficult, the screenplay makes no sense if you 
haven't seen the original. But, the majority of 
Stallone fans don 't go to his films for the act-
ing or character depth. There are plenty of 
cars and "bad people" that go boom, enough 
to satiate the average action fan. However, 
compared to its predecessor, all the action 
choreography and special effects don't add up 
to the original's exquisite direction and natur-
al suspense.

he continued. "Sometimes just doing an 
abstract movement that requires the audience 
to study our vulnerability is enough to 
explore this fear." 

In general. I get the idea that jones' work is 
slowly shifting. He is famous for his success 
in conveying pertinent social and personal 
issues with his art. However, he has recently 
been investigating important issues in a more 
abstract way. The idea is that the body' itself 
can communicate a lot, perhaps more, 
through movement, through the body, 
through that part which precedes the intel-
lect. 

"My dances before wanted to vindicate 
wrongs done; to point out hypocrisy. I've used 
sex in my dances to hit people over the head, 
but I've realized it's not necessary. What is 
enough now? Is a beautiful dance in itself 
enough?" 

Bill T jones quotes taken from 
http://www.saion.comimarch97Ijones970328.hlml 

"The Ladies Man" is a classic "Saturday 
Night Live" skit turned movie. Tim Meadows 
plays Leon Phelps, a swinging bachelor who is 
tragically stuck in the '70s, afro and all. The 
character is warm and agreeable, which is a 
nice contrast to other SNL characters that 
have had a tendency to annoy your senses to 
death. Leon is a plain likable guy with his 
gaudy retro gear and exaggerated lisp. For that 
matter, one can half-believe all the Clinton ian 
luck this swinger enjoys with a popular late- . 
night talk show and the growing romance 
with his producer Julie (Karyn Parsons) . If 
anything, this film should be checked out for 
Will Ferrell's hilarious role as a deranged hus-
band scouring the streets of Chicago, a la 
"West Side Story." 

But beyond the highjinks already seen in 
S L skits, "The Ladies Man" fails to add fur-
ther depth or personality to the character. 
Therefore, the story never progresses outside 
of two-dimensional characters. This results in 
a repetitive cycle of jokes and themes that get 
old fast - very fast. But, if you can stand 
watching an hour-and-20-minute-Iong SNL 
skit, then you should have no problems with 
"T!Je Ladies Man."

Films: 
"Girlfight" star is 
compared to Branda 
ConUnued from ..... 15 

angles. dusky palates and clever 
lighting. The film is a visual treat, 
not only with million·dollar spe· 
cial effects, but with the deft cine· 
matography Kaminski has dis · 
played in past masterpieces, 
Although the setting is superb, 
Kaminski's handling of the char· 
acters and script (written by 
Pierce Gardner and Betsy Stahl) is 
less impressive. Ryder and Chap· 
lin are at times overshadowed by 
the monstrous and creepy setting, 
Kaminski does nothing to offset 
or emphasize this imbalance. The 
director should also have taken 
some liberties with the script and 
kept Chaplin English as his Amer· 
ican accent was strained and ugly . 

"Lost Souls" definitely ha'S a 
flare for terror, but strangely, in a 
nondisturbing kind of way. Kamin· 
ski grabs, or rather, pounces on the 
audience with meticulous visual 
effects, but fails to capture the 
undercurrent of mental distur· 

A-
Great first-time effort for 

writer/director Karyn Kusama, who 
delivers a densely packed, explosive 
film about a woman (Rodriguez) in 
search of her identity both inside 
and outside of the boxing ring, 
Kusama not only charges the film 
with female empowerment, but . 
injects the frustration and c1austro· 
phobia of a low· income Latino 
community, trying to tack on as 
many social layers as the narrative 
will allow. The film's strongest 
theme, however, centers on the 
more universal search for identity. 

Newcomer Michelle Rodriguez 
punches out so much angst and 
repression as Diana, her identity 
could well be considered Brando's 
counterpart in "The Waterfront," 
But, Rodriguez's true strength lies 
in an ultra·guarded gentleness that 
exudes even at her most volatile 

. moments. 
Unfortunately, the romance 

with Santiago Douglas is a hin· 
drance to the self·empowering 
message, not finding a suitable 
niche between Rodriguez's frus-
trated rage and adolescent insecu-
rity.

. b;mce the script very much alludes 

. to. A good "Fun house" movie 
where the scare wears off once you 
leave the theater. Definitely worth 
the price for the ride. 

"Girlfight" succeeds on virtually 
all levels, offering powerful acting, 
intense direction and an accom· 
plished script. It doesn't inspire a 
David versus Goliath complex like 
all those "Rocky" movies did for 
Italian Americans. Instead, it cap· 
tures a feeling of isolation and sep· 
aration that causes your fist to 
clench in indignation, unfolding a 
panoramic view into Diana's limit· 
ed world. Great film.

OJ Skribble 
Essential Dance 2000 

Atlantic 

C 

Riding on the coattails of his 
success with MTv; OJ Skribble has 
released 19 tracks of unforgettable 
(or forgettable, depending on 
whose side you're on) club hits. He 
drop.s in tracks that even novice 
electronica fans will quickly recog-
nize, not to mention remixes of 
Cher's "I Believe: Paula Cole's "I 
Believe in Love" and Filter's "Take 
a Picture: 

The "Essential Dance" mix is 
chock full of radio edits and club 
mixes. These songs are guaranteed 
gold for any mainstream party, and 
they blow the tops off those con-
sidering themselves anti-trend .or 
anti-drumroll . 

Skribble also shamelessly drops 
in the biggest club hits of recent 
times: "Sexual (Li Da Di)" by 
Amber, "Bodyrock" by Moby, 
"9PM (Till I Come)" by ATB and 
"Kernkraft 400" by Zombie 
Nation. Por anyone who has paid 
any attention to the dance music 
scene, these songs are all too famil-
iar. 

Electronica purists,' stay away. 
Mainstream clubheads, embrace it.

This album won't evoke images 

of your youth, because chances are 
you weren't around to remember 
the '50s or '60s. But "Street Comer 
Serenade" takes you on a fantasy 
trip to an era where boy bands 
actually knew how to sing and belt 
out those high notes. 

Oddly enough, somehow you 
inherently know the words to these 
songs already. This nostalgic com-
pilation has all the tunes you sing 
at the top of your lungs in the car. 
Uplifting bubblegum hits like 
"Blue Moon" and "Book of Love" 
are beautifully complimented with 
classic love songs like "Earth Ango:l 
(Will You be Mine)" and "Stay" by 
Maurice Williams and The Zodi-
acs. 

And, yes, this album is sold on

Soccer: 
Women need to win two, 
tie one for playoff berth 
CoIdII •• ".. ..... II 

Triton goalkeeper Kami Poma 
continued her solid freshman sea-
son, making two saves to earn her 
seventh shutout of the year. 

The Lancers' Melissa Stoops 
gave up three goals and was forced 
to make five saves. 

The win was the Tritons' sev-
enth in a row. Although the team is 
playing extremely well, McManus 
still thinks his team can get better. 

"I think we always have room to 
improve," McManus said. "We 
improved during the second half 
last night" 

UCSD is flying on a combina-
tion of effort from their veterans 
and from some new faces. 

"We have more new players this 
year than we've had in years," 
McManus said. "We have 10 first-
year players. That's a big chunk. 
When you think about it, we've 
only played 13 games. I think we've 
come together exceptionally quick-
ly. You can't say which of the fresh -
man are standing out because they 
all are." 

The Tritons have playoffs on 
their minds. Two wins and a tie in 
their final three CCAA games 
would all but assure the team of a 
postseason berth. 

Next up for UCSD is a match 
against Grand Canyon University 
in Phoenix on Friday at 1 p.m. On 
Tuesday, the Tritons return home 
to host California State University 
San Bernardmo at 5 p.m.

4. 'However, Long Beach scored 
three more goals to go into the 
fourth quarter up 9-4. 

Down five goals, the Tritons 
were not able to come back and 
just traded goals with Long Beach 
in the fou rth to make the final 
score 11-6. 

This loss broke the Tritons' 
seven-game winning streak that 
included big wins against 
Pepperdine and UCSB. 

Djopic added three more goals 
in this game and has 29 goals this 
season. Samuels and Allen , alo ng 
with Kenny Woodruff, each added 
a goal for the Tritons. Samuels 
leads the Tritons this year with 46 
goals. 

The Tritons made a lot of 
defensive mistakes this weekend, 
which was uncharacteristic of their 
trademarked ability to shut teams 
down. 

"We made a number of silly 
mistakes against UCSB, at least 
four that I can count that led to 
goals: Harper said. "Against Long 
Beach it was not any bener as we 
just had some mental breakdowns, 
bOlh individually and teamwise." 

This weekend UCSD hopes to 
rebound from its loss with a good 
showing at the NorCal 
Tournament. 

The Tritons will face Air Force 
in their first match, and although 
Airforce is currently ranked 17th, 
the harried rivalry between the 
Thtons and Air Force assures a 
good match. 

If the Tritons defeat Air Force, 
their next match will be against 
UC Berkeley. 

Cal will be out for blood in this 
one as UCSD upset them earlier in 
the season, defeating them for the 
first time in years. 

"If we make it to the Cal game, 
that is going to be intense and full 
of action: Harper said. "Those 
guys are going to be out for a linle 
bit ofmmge." 

The 'tHtons wiD go into the 
tournament ranked seventh in the 
nation, a drop of two spots from 
their prnious week's rating of 
fifth.

Club Sports Suffer 
Division II rules leave teams out in the cold 
IJ _lIT FULION 
Sports Editor 

Athletics can be a harrowing 
experience. Bodies fty, blpod spews 
and people get hurt. This is when: 
trainers come in. 

Unfonunately for the UCSD 
club sports teams, this necessity is 
being denied. 

Previously, the sports club 
teams received access to facilities 
and trainers equally with NCAA 
teams. If there were a club sports 
event and an NCAA contest at the 
same time, a trainer would be sent 
to whichever event needed one the 
most. 

That is no longer the case. 
Because of the move to Division 

II and the new rules to which the 
school must adhere, the trainers 
and their facilities are being maxed 
out. 

Coaches are now considered 
full-time staff. Also, teams can 
now practice year-round instead 
qf Qnly 30 days prior to the sea-
son's start. 

"There are full-time coaches 
and full-time schedules: said 
Marcia Klaiber, UCSD's head ath-
letic trainer. "They now place more 
demand on varsity athletics and on 
trainers: 

Also, the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association, the confer-
ence to which UCSD belongs, 
requires that a trainer be present at 
all home events. 

Club sports teams, despite their 
need, are being denied ac;:cess 
because of this overextension of 
facilities. 

There are 16 club sports, among 
which are high-contact events such 
as rugby and lacrosse. 

Even though the move to 

Division II had been finalized and 
heralded for some time, Klaiber 
and club sports director Scott 
Berndes did not hear about the 
new rules until this summer. 

MThey had mentioned it over 
the summer,· Berndes said. MI did-
n't know it was going to happen so 
fast. It would have been nice to 
have known: 

Neither the club sports nor the 
training room has had time to 
adjust to the change. 

MNone of this was known until a 
CCAA meeting in June,· Klaiber 
said. "That's when we heard. We 
haven't had a lot of time: 

Another strain on the trainers 
is the way the training room can 
operate. The National Athletic 
Trainers' Association has changed 
the rules on internships in the 
training department, meaning the 
training room has difficulty in hir-
ing and retaining qualified train-
ers. 

The relationship between 
UCSD sports clubs and the train-
ing room is unique. The training 
facilities have been open to club 
sports in the past, a practice 
unknown to most other universi-
ties, which often have trainers 
excl usiveiy for cI ub sports. 

That is the road UCSD will 
have to take to make sure Thton 
club sports members have training 
facilities. 

Another route is the possibility 
of receiving support through 
Student Health, though it does not 
have the necessary facilities, and 
the process is time consuming. 

·We're in big trouble if we don't 
get some money,· Berndes said. 
"We're going to try and use the 
Student Health Center, but they 
don 't have what we n~ed ." 

The UCSD Guardian SPORTS 23 

Not all Wealthy Athletes Completely Selfish 

ARVIND VASAN 

n element of sports to A which everyone has ba:ome accustomed is 
the . high salary level. 

Players such as ShaquiUe O'Neal 
and Kevin Gamet make humon-
gous amounts of money a year, 
not counting signing bonuses and 

. endorsement deals. How and 
when: they spend their money is 
up in the air, but seeing players in 
Bendeys and Rolls Royces is cus-
tomary. 

Despite this. there is another 
side to the players - the human-
itarian side - that appeals to peo-
ple. We, the general public, rarely 
get to hear or see the charities 
players set up to help people with 
diseases or people from a rough 
neighborhood. [ will give you a 
few examples of players who have 
used their celebrity status to help 
their cities and those less fortu-
nate. 

The first player that comes to 
mind is Alonzo Mourning, the 
center for the Miami Heat. 
Alonzo puts on an annual chari-
ty fund that brings NBA players 
to Miami for a pickup game. The 
money generated from the game 
is given to heIp inner-city youth 
in Miami . Mourning donates 
almost half his own salary for his 
foundation , the ZO foundation . 

Recently Mourning suffered a 
kidney ailment that will sideline 
him for the rest of the season. 
Throughout his ordeal. he has 
shown a great amount of poise, 

saying, "The main objective is to 
get me healthy so I can live my 
life normally, so I can see my 
babies grow up and so I can 
enjoy my family: These qualities 
make Alonzo Mourning a great 
humanitarian and role model 

Another humanitarian that 
helped sp~d awareness about a 
panicular disease was Arthur 
Ashe. Ashe was the first African-
American Davis Cup Tennis 
Tournament participant and the 
first black male to win the U.S. 
Open and Wimbledon. Ashe 
made his mark on the sport of 
tennis as well as helping to 
heighten African American 
awareness about sports. In 1992, 
his life ended tragically after being 
diagnosed with AIDS. The Arthur 
Ashe Foundation was then creat-
ed to help AIDS research and 
families who have loved ones 
diagnosed with the horrible dis-
ease. He made us think - and 
think hard - about racism, 
health, education and charity. 
Ashe was something bigger than 
spons, a man who tried to reach 
everyone who wanted to listen 
and make them aware of the most 
important factor of all: health. 

A humanitarian athlete that 
cannot be forgotten is Steve Smith 
of the Portland Trailblazers. His 
excellence in basketball has been 
due to personal goals and his pur-
suit of greatness. He just complet-
ed a great summer on the gold 
medal-winning USA basketball 
team. 

While ht; was 'attending col-
lege at Michigan State 
University, Smith 's mother died 
of cancer. Two years ago, Smith 
donated $2 million to set up a 
scholarship fund to send less for-
tunate youth to college at 

Michigan State. He has donated 
this amount for the last two 
years, never faltering on his goal 
to help his community. 

The last athlete I will mention 
is Dikembe Mutombo, the 
defensive specialist of the Atlanta 
Hawks. He is an extraordinary 
man, growing up in Zaire until 
his family moved to America to 
get away from the civil unrest. He 
attended Georgetown University 
and w.as the star player among 
John Thompson's Hoyas. He was 
drafted in 1992 by the Denver 
Nuggets, but was traded to the 
Atlanta Hawks in 1996. His 
defensive play has brought him 
much acclaim as well as two 
Defensive Player of the Year 
awards, yet his excellence off the 
court makes him one of the most 
benevolent athletes in the world. 
He has donated his time and 
money during the basketball off-
season to settle the unrest in 
Zaire, where he recently caught 
malaria, and help build houses 
and schools in his homeland. His 
humanitarian stance has won 
him prestige as well: He will be 
given the 2000 President 's 
Service Award, Ute USA's highest 
honor for volunteer service. 
Dikembe has made the American 
public aware ofthe civil unrest in 
Zaire and Africa as a whole, and 
his charitable stance is a wel-
come phenomenon in sports. 

As players get wealthier, we 
tend to see a decline in the num-
ber of athletes who take on the 
role of volunteers who aid a cause 
or help their community or home-
land. In this time of booming 
salaries, it is heartening to hear 
about extraordinary men who dis-
regard their egos and assist those 
in need.

26 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian 

Swimming to Make Splash 
Returning swimmers, newcomers, look to drown the competition 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's swimming program 
was always impressive at the 
Division III level. With their 
inaugural season as a Division II 
competitor looming, swim head 
coach Scott McGihon finds no 
reason to reduce the school's 
expectations. 

"It's a bit hard to accurately 
predict how we will perform 
because we haven't really compet-
ed at this level ," McGihon said, 
"but I expect that we will finish in 
the top five in the United States 
on both the men's and women's 
sides." 

The key to ~he Tritons' success 
this year will be the team's ability 
to function as a unit. Though the 
participants strive for individual 
times, the team score and support 
also counts. 

"We are putting a real empha-
sis on promoting team cohesive-
ness this season: McGihon said. 
"We want to operate as one 
group instead of a bunch of indi-
viduals. People think of swim-
ming as an individual sport, but 
the team aspect is very impor-
tant, especially in the relay 
events: 

The men's team will be led by 
a number of stalwart returning 
players and some key recruits. 

Senior Ryan Wong looks to be 
a standout performer in a num-
ber of events for the Tritons, 
especially in the backstroke and 
individual medley races. Seniors 
Rusty Jones and Danny Fisher 
should make a splash in the 
spririts while teammate Greg 
Scott, another senior, hopes to 

make a positive impact in the 
breaststroke. 

McGihon is optimistic about 
Scott 's upcoming season. 

"Greg is a great breaststroke 
performer and will have a solid 
chance of finding success at the 
Division II level: he said. 

Sophomore Luke Seed 
should also turn in some scoring 
times, Another freshman recruit, 
Rob Small looks to establish 
himself in a number events, 

"It's a bit hard to 
accurately predict how 
well we will perfonn. 
because we haven't 
really competed at this 
level, but [ expect that 
we will finish in the top 
five in the United 
States .,." 

- Scott Mc8Ihon 
Triton Swim Coach 

inel uding the breaststroke, 1M 
and middle-distance freestyle 
events. 

On the wom~n's side it would 
be amiss not to start with sopho-
more Jennifer Watanabe, who 
stood head and shoulders above 
the competition last year as a true 
freshman. 

The 2000 recruiting class has 
produced a windfall for Triton 
women's swimming, as nine solid' 
swimmers have been added to the 
roster. 

Looking to stand out among 

these newcomers are freshmen 
Carly Ross, who will be compet-
ing in the sprint and bUJterfly 
events, and Nina Tomasevich, 
who is a distance freestyler. 
Freshman Caroline KWQk, along 
with her sister Evelyn, a junior, 
will both be looking to chalk up 
some scoring times in the 
freestyle sprints. 

The 'Tritons are going to be 
facing off against some tough 
competition on both the men's 
and women's sides 'en route to 
their desired goal to a top-five fin-
ish . 

For the men, the stiffest chal-
lenges will come courtesy of Cal 
State Bakersfield, a team that has 
been strong in the past. Drury 
College, a well-established and 
endowed program in Missouri, 
will also be tough. UC Davis will 
be tough match also. For the 
women, Drury will ol}ce again be 
a difficult opponent, as will 
Truman State and University of 
North Dakota . 

UCSD hopes to establish 
itself as a factor early in the sea-
son, setting a tone they hope will 
carry them through the year. 
First, they will be heading up to 
the mean streets of USC for the 
USC Invitational. That is where 
they will be facing off with such 
tough swimming squads from 
UC Berkeley, UC Santa Barbara, 
UC Irvine, and Cal State 
Bakersfield. 

The 'Tritons will use this non-
scoring meet to tune up for the 
regular season, opening with the 
women against USD on Nov. 10, 
followed by both teams swimming 
against rival Cal State Bakersfield 
on Nov. 11.

with a fair-headed lass over who 
could drain his or her pint of swill 
the fastest , and that was the end of 
the nigh t for me. 

I awoke with what felt like a 
mixture of Pop Rocks and Pepsi 
exploding in my fragile dome. I 
attempted to shake the cobwebs to 
no avail before glancing at the 
clock, grabbing my gear and head-
ing for the car. Hangover or no 
hangover, there was softball to 
play! 

You can only imagine my cha-
grin when I rolled up to the field to 
find Ollt that the tournament is 
sponsored by Miller Genuine 
Draft, and all those iced-down 
coolers fu II of frosty beers are free 
and ripe for the picking. I gave in , 
vaguely recalling the hair-of-the-
dog theory that I once heard, 
because who am Ito question fate? 

I evtntually sucked down 
enough coldies to feel capable of 
the most basic motor skills just in 
time for our first game. We 
emerged victorious in a game 
where the details are hazy due to 
the fact that the majority of my 

Thursday, October 19, 2000 

brain cells had gone the way of the 
Andrea Doria, but I do recall one 
true highlight. 

1 remember standing on third 
when a huge, yellow chicken 
emerged from out of nowhere. He 
stormed the field, where he began 
harassing the players and falling 
down numerous times before 
climbing the backstop, perching on 
top, where he rained down vitriol 
on the players below. 

Drinking and playing continued 
until, before we knew it, our team 
of hired geeks from Slamm 
Magazine found itself in the cham-
pionship game, going "mano a 
mano" with a prominent San 
Diego rock band. 

Play in this game was intense, 
with hard-hit line drives, tight 
defensive play, dogs running loose 
on the infield, a pitcher smoking a 
Cigarette and attempting to lug his 
cooler ou! onto the mound, and to 
top it all off, the day's Most 
Valuable Drinker whipping out his 
Louisville Slugger and taking a leak 
on the field to protest a call he 
found particularly unjust. 

The beer had flowed freely all 
day in the San Diego sun. The 
journalists, if that term is even 
applicable to our crew of chumps, 
misfits and obvious degenerates, 
had beaten the rock stars in a heat-
ed showdown. If that was not 
enough, the word on the street was 
that an Ep party was going down 
that very evening with unlimited 
dollar drafts. I am definitely not is 
the type of schmuck to question 
fate. Cheersl

Bobby Saadati is Having a Big Season for UCSD 
!iot only is the men's soccer star leading his team in goals, Saadati is also leading the CCANs Southern Division 
By JEUICA KRUIKAMP 
Staff Writer 

USCD men's soccer player 
Bobby Saadati may be a newcomer 
to UCSD, Division II athletics and 
his position as midfielder, but that 
has not stopped this soccer veter-
an . Saaditi leads the California 
Collegiate Athletics Association 
Southern. Division with 20 points 

Being 111 the double digits in the 
goals-scored category has led this 
political science transfer student to 
a successful season. According to 
Saadati, he trained hard to be 
under the direction of head coach 
Derek Armstrong, 

Opting to transfer to UCSD 
instead of San Francisco State UC 
Irvine or Concordia Unive~ity, 
Sa~d.ati trained intensely before 
arnvlIlg on the Triton scene, ready 
to be coached by Armstrong. 

. "The man is a soccer genius," 
Saadati said. "I came to learn 
under him: 
, i\rmstrong placed Saadati in a 
position to which he is not quite 
accustomed. His new place on the 
field has him defending a consider-
able amount more than he used to. 
Coupled with having the highest 
number of goals - double that of 
any other member of the team -
Saadati is a busy soccer player. 

"This is different for him" 
Armstrong said. ·We have so~e 
huge games coming up and the 
other teams definitely know about 
him. He tends to be doubled upon, 
and he takes the brunt of it, but he 
is a decent player who can get 
through it: 

Saadati describes his job on the 
team as one where he defends, but 
also smashes the soccer ball into 

the goal. Other teammates say he 
accomplishes this as well as taking 
on a leadership role. 

According to sophomore goal-
keeper Ryan Weirich, Saadati sets a 
terrific leadership example. 

"He is a silent leader who plays 
very hard and leads by his actions," 
Weirich said. "He turned out as 
being someone who was not very 
outspoken but who gives every-
thing he has all the time." 

Making it this far in his soccer 
career, with such an incredible year 
as a Triton, was a long way in com-
ing. Saadati began playing soccer at 
age 7 with his family, which was 
very involved in the sport as well. 
The maturity of his game has 
increased by playing for UCSD. 

"I have developed my game a lot 
recently, but it took a lot of yelling 
and a lot of training," Saadati said. 
.. Being here in the first year of 
Division II action h~s changed my 
game," Saadati said. "I have learned 
to play in a more organized way, and 
defending in soccer is new as well: 

Saadati's efforts on the field 
have strengthened the team as a 
whole, according to Weirich . His 
silent leadership is demonstrated in 
every aspect of the game. 

"He has really added a powerful 
dimension to the team through his 
skills, talent and ability to get the 
job done," Weirich said. "The 
example is set every time he plays." 

There are times, however, when 
Saadati does not play perfectly, 
according to Armstrong. Even 
then, he still is a formidable player. 

"No one plays perfectly every 
game: Armstrong said. "But, even 
if he is having an off game, he can 
still unsettle the defense because of 
the effort that he puts out. We saw

that many times throughout, as the 
season went on: 

Saadati constantly strives to put 
forth large amounts of effort, and 
does not let his place at the top of 

the heap of statistics bother him. 
"Going into this season, I was a 

little nervous. But I know that in 
the near future, after the season, I 
will be able to look back and see 

how much potential I and the team 
s~rted with. [ will also be happy

t is not every night that you 
meander into your front yard 
to find it engulfed in flames. 

Yet this was the case when I 
stumbled out of my front door on 
Friday night to find our revered 
lawn couch ablaze, with flames and 
smoke billowing madly into the 
night sky. The culprit, Crazy Jim, 
lurked sheepishly in the flickering 
shadows, admiring his handiwork. 
Dammit man! I didn't need this, 
and most certainly not that night, 
for the next day I would be taking 
part in one of the Southland's most 
extreme sporting endeavors - the 
San Diego Softball Challenge -
and I needed to have my wits about 
me.

Volleyball 
Keeps on 
Rolling 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Staff Writer 

Riding the momentum from its 
convincing victory the prior 
evening, the UCSD women's vol-
leyball squad strode right into 
Recreation Hall at UC Davis on 
Saturday night and annihilated the 
competition in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
play. 

The Aggies were simply over-
matched, although thei r coach 
attributed their pathetic play to a 
marathon five-game upset win over 
Grand Canyon University the night 
before. 

Fatigue or no fatigue, it was not 
hard to tell who was the more 
skilled team on this night , as the 
Tritons swept the home team in 
three games with scores of 15-11, 
15-6 and 15-8. The Triton team 's 
performance clearly impressed 
Aggie coach Stephanie Hawbecker, 
who said the team was very consis-
tent. 

Junior middle Kathleen Hentz 
was the obvious standout for 
UCSD in the match, contributing 
10 kills with no errors to amass a 
.833 hitting percentage while also 
chipping in four blocks. Also shin-
ing for the Tritons were Shannon 
Hawes and Diana Camarillo, each 
contributing seven kills for the vic-
torious blue and gold. 

With the win, the streaki ng 
Tritons improve their already ster-
ling record to 11-2 in CCAA play 
and 17-4 overall, while Davis ' 
marks fa ll to 6-7 in CCAA and 12-
11 overall. 

The Tritons now head into the 
dense fog of Northern California 
this weekend to battle against 
Sonoma State and San Francisco 
State in two important divisional 
games.

Polo Winning Streak Ends 
Tritons fall short against Long Beach, pick up win against UCSB 
By TAIT MILLER 
Associate Sports Editor 

During a two-game road trip 
this weekend against some stiff 
competition in the form of UCSB 
and Long Beach State, the men 's 
water polo team went 1-1, defeat-
ing UCSB 12-9 and falling to 
Long Beach State 11-6. 

The Santa Barbara match was 
a shootout on both sides of the 
ball with neither team giving any 
ground. 

The end of the first quarter 
saw the match tied at two, and as 
the second quarter began, the 
stalemate looked to continue as 
the Tritons and UCSB split the 
first eight goals to make the score 
an even 4-4. 

While the 10th-ranked 
Gauchos were done with their 
scoring for the time being, UCSD 
was just heating up as they reeled 
off six of the next seven goals to 
take a commanding 10-5 lead 
part way through the third quar-
ter. 

The Triton charge was led by 
Jonathan Samuels and Brett Allen 
who each scored two goals d~ring 
this stretch . 

The game looked all but over 
at that point but the Gauchos still 
had some Spartan fight left in 
them. 

Down 10-5, UCSB stormed 
back with three quick goals to 
close out the third quarter and 
cut the lead to a within-striking-
distance 10-8. 

That was as close as the 
Gauchos got. UCSD outscored 
them 2-1 in the fourth quarter to 
make the final score 12-9 

The Tritons ' were led by the 
monster play of Samuels and 
Vladimir Djopic. Samuels had a 
huge offensive day, scoring five 
goals. Djopic was not far behind 

as he pitched in three more. 
"Justin Wylie had a great set 

day and Samuels was getting the 
ball at the two-meter mark all day 
long: said head coach Dennis 
Harper. "He made things hap-
pen: 

Allen added two goals during 
the Triton run, and Kellan Hori 
and Patrick Treman each scored a 
goal to round out UCSD 's scor-
ing. 

The UCSB game was as huge 
a win the Tritons have had in 
years, since UCSD defeated 
UCSB at home. 

"They have such a home court 
advantage: Harper said. "They 
have a shallow pool and the 
crowds up their are just raucous. 
It is a big win for us." 

The Long Beach game was in 
direct contrast to the way UCSD 
played Santa Barbara. . 

Instead of coming out strong 
like they did against the Gauchos, 
and like th~y have all year long, 
UCSD could not work up even 
one goal in the first quarter, and 
went into the second quarter 
down 3-0. 

This put the Tritons on the 
defensive, and for the rest of the 
game they were playing catch-up. 

To complicate matters, the 
Long Beach 4gers scored the first 
three goals of the second quarter 
to put the Tritons in a hole that 
even Dante could not make his 
way out of. 

From that point on, UCSD 
seemed to awake from its slumber 
and scored the final two goals of 
the first half to cut the Long 
Beach lead to 6-2. 

The third quarter saw UCSD 
continue its emergence from 
hibernation as it played the 4gers 
pretty evenly to cut the lead to 6-

The UCSD women's soccer 
team continued to roll after anoth-
er victory on Monday. 

The Tritons earned the 3-0 vic-
tory against California Baptist 
University. The match up was non-
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, giving UCSD a ml!ch-
needed rest by playing against a 
weaker school. 

"When we did the schedule, we 
didn't have a game that week," said 
women's soccer head coach Brian 
McManus. "I wanted a game. Cal 
Baptist is a good team. They always 
play you physical." 

UCSD saw contributions from 
various sources. 

Elizabeth Hughes logged her 
first goal of the season in the sec-
ond minute of the first half. Julia 
Cuder assisted on the score with a 
corner kick feed . 

"[In[ the first half I didn 't think 
we played very well , but in the sec-
ond half we did," McManus said. 
"Our two goals were two good 
goals: 

The Tritons took off in the sec-
ond period. Erika Alfredson, con-
tinuing her season-long roll, took a 
pass from Hughes and Cindy 
Dostalek to score a goal in the 68th 
minute, making the game 2-0. 

Christy Abizaid completed the 
scoring for UCSD in the 75th 
minute off a Dostalek pass.
