Fox Confronts 
Complexities of 
Governing Mexico 

MEXICO CITY - Five months 
into his ·te rm as the first opposition 
president of Mexico in 71 years, 
Vicente Fox is learning that presi-
dencies made by democracy can 
also be battered by them. 

In recent weeks, Fox has 
watched a politically divided - but 
defiantly independent - Mexican 
Congress redesign the Indian 
rights bill, one of his most impor- . 
tant political initiatives. The presi-
dent had hoped the bill would

u.s. Census Finds 
Whites a Minority 
In Many Cities 

COLUMBIA, Mo. - Many 
cities, including St. Louis, no longer 
have a white majority, according to 
2000 U.S. census. data. 

Whites have lost their majority 
status largely due to the increasing 
Hispanic populations. 

Berube also said the trend of 
increasing Hispanic populations 
spans the United States. 

The growth is especially pro-
nounced in coastal cities such as 
New York, Los Angeles and San 
Francisco. 

"Cities act as a leading indicator 
of change across the U.S.," Berube 
said.

A Dive Ahead ... A.S. Seel{s 
Input for 
Committee 
Forums held for ideas 
on new fee referendum 
By ED WU 
Staff Wnter 

The new A.5. Council met \Vith studeills 
in two open forums to brainstorm Ideas 011 
forming a commi ttee to create a new fee rl'f-
erendull1 for student services. 

The second forum was held Tuesday; the 
first was held Friday of fifth week.

Facing a freeze on increases in spcnding 
and severe funding cuts for the 2001-200:l 
school year, members of student organiza-
tions such as the Food Co-op, sports club 
teams, KSDT and the college councils came 
together to voice their opinions, debating 
whether a r('presentative structure or con-
sensus was the best way to handle the for-
mation of next yea r's referendum . 

In light of the recent defeat of this year's 
Campus Life Fee Referendum, A.5. Prcsidcnt 
Jeff Dodge called the first meeting to discuss 
a way in which a comminee could be formed 
that was more representative of thc opinions 
of the student body at large. The goal was to 
eventually garner the necessary support for a 
fee increase.

Staff Writer 

Marshall senior David Kim expressed the 
dual purposes of the week's events. 

Students gathereq in the Price Center on 
Monday to kick off UCSD's "Out and Proud 
Week." 

Students stepped up to speak during an 
open microphone session, addressing the need 
for acceptance of the homosexual, bisexual and 
transgender community. 

"The 'Out and Proud Week' is not only a 
time for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and 
Transgender Association to express their expe-
rience with coming out, but also for straight 
people who aren't so narrow-minded to speak 
up in situations when their peers say things 
that are homophobic and to not let things 
slide," Kim said. 

As a result, debate at the meeting Cl'n-
tered on what would be th e most effective 
way to represent the concerns of all students 
affected by a fec increase. 

Due to the representational voting nature 
of the previous committee, many present 
found the meetings harsh and divided. 

The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender 
Resource Office is sponsoring the events this 
week.

Tia Molly to Close Due to Retirement 
Family-run restaurant was built on tradition of customer service 
By CARLAN WENDLER 
Staff Writer 

Tia Molly, a fixture in the Price 
Center since 1989, will close its 
burrito station and gri lls this sum-
mer when its owner and chief of 
operations, Molly Lee, retires. 

The story ofTia Molly.does not 
start with her move to UCSD 12 
years ago. Her first restaurant ven-
ture, Chung King Loh in Solana 
Beach, was a great success for Lee 
in the '80s. The family-run busr-
ness had the opportunity to 
expan to San Diego State 
University and the San Diego ai r-
port at around the same time as it 
opened in the Price Center, but 
Lee turned down these opportuni-
ties each time they came up. 

"I did not like all the politics [of 
the airport site!. and the students 
are different over [at SDSU[," Lee 
said: 
• Lee sold the space now occu-
pied by Wok's Up, changed the 
name of the restaurant from 
Chung King Loh to Tia Molly, and 
moved into its current space 
because of the business' rapid 
growth . 

"We needed more space," Lee 
said . "So we replaced Taco Bell." 

The interesting blend of na-
vors, ranging from Peruvian rotis-
serie chicken to moo-shoo burri-
tos, distinguishes Tia Molly from 
the franchise and corporate resi-
dents on either side of it. 

"[ care about the customers: 
Lee said, "That's why [ serve the 

vegetarian food . We have a person-
al knowledge of our people. When 
I see a certain professor coming, I 
know he likes mushrooms, so we 
make him a mushroom burri-
to. When I sec this guy coming, I 
know he's allergic to onions alid 
garlic, so we make a special burri-
to for him." 

Such concern for the well-
being of her customers has char-
acterized the Lee's philosophy 
throughout her years here. When 
asked what her marketing strategy 
was by the IO-person panel that 
approved new ventures in the 
Pri ce Center food court, Lee 
recalled her reply: "What's a mar-
ket[ing] strategy? We just want to 
offer quality food that the students 
ca n afford." 

The quality of th e restaurant IS 
usually attributed to Lee, but she 
is quick to credit her partners 
"Uncle" and Sophia Fong. Unck 
Fong takes care of the cooking and 
Sophia assumes the business rok. 
manning the cash registers, keep-
ing up with cleaning and other 
duties. 

Molly considers herself the 
"fighter, " ensuring that her 
employ'res succeed in life and do 
not caich any nak from adl11lnls-
tration. 

Though Tia Molly has never 
been able to pay its employees the 
highest wages (the founders still 
work for around $6 per hour), 
Molly has been able to give big

Forum: 
Students seek to create a more 
representative committee 
Contl_ed from INC. 1 
continue: makes for a hostile environment; 
Dodge said, remarking on the fact that a 
number of votes on the committee ended up 
being split 11 -6. " [t's difficult to get a correct 
representation ." 

The general consensus was that those 
represented on the previous committee 
were the most active students at UCSD, 
and thus the most likely to favor expansion 
of student fees to increase funding for pro-
grams in which they have vested interests. 

"It's important for people who are not 
involved with anything to come to the meet-
ings; Parent said. 

by consensus in open meetings, thus allow-
ing every student an influential say and pre-
venting railroading by majority. 

However, those in attendance saw flaws 
with such a system. 

"I'm scared that an active group could 
send a overrepresentation of members, stop-
ping any positive things; said Muir College 
Council Chair Liz Erwin. 

Others agreed and felt that consistent 
and active participation in any group 
involved in forming the new referendum 
was a must for voting, whether by majority 
or consensus, if anyone was allowed to help 
create the new referendum. 

Otherwise, a sports team or fraternity 
with a vested interest could stack a particu-
larly crucial meeting. 

Kris Bohling, vice president of the 
Graduate Student Association , supported 

mefnbership that was com-
He also noted that many 

of those affected would be 
the least active students, 
who would see little poten-
tial benefit in raising their 
fees to support services and 
organizations they do not 
use. 

"The problem is in the 
demographics - the colleges 
get five reps, but where do 
low-income people come 
in?" said Gordon Chang, a 
member of the UCSD Green 
Party. "They might be work-
ing when the committee 
meets." 

Debate hinged on a 
crucial question: if 
a representative 
committee was 
formed, how would 
anyone determine 
what constituted a 
demographic in 
need of 
representation? 

pletely open to the commu-
nity at large so no voice 
could be excluded in a con-
sensus decision. 

James Lynch, of 
University Centers Advisory 
Board, disagreed. 

"We can't have a com-
mittee of 20,000 - it's 
absurd:' Lynch sa id. "I say 
we have a representative 
body - one group, one 
vote." 

Debate hinged on a cru-
cial question - how to 
determine what constituted a 
demographic in need of rep-

Chang menrioned the 
fact that those on the committee have a 
vested interest in raising fees, a sentiment 
not necessarily shared by the rest of the 
campus. 

"It's a socioeconomic thing," Chang said. 
"Differences in programming between the 
five colleges doesn't necessarily mean differ-
ent viewpoints on a referendum." 

All agreed that the priority is developing a 
process where all voices in the campus com-
munity are heard. 

As a result, one of the first suggestions 
raised was that the new committee operate

resentation if a representative 
committee were fonned. 

While a myriad of campus organizations 
is given a definitive number of representa-
tives, students not involved would be under-
represented. 

Suggestions for resolving this problem 
ranged from selecting random students to 
participate on the committee, to town hall 
meetings to make committee members 
accountable to the voice of the campus at 
large.

Proposal Will Harm 
Student Services 

When UCSD students rejected the 
Campus Life Fee Referendum two weeks 
ago, they were making a statement to the 
administration: Studellts want to decide 
how their tuition dollars are to be spent, 
not the administra tion . The students 
voted down th e option of increasing 
tuition by $210 to improve student life 9n 
campus, which included the expansion of 
the Price Center. 

Regardless, Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph Watson fel t the expansion 
was still necessary and he advocated a 10 
percent decrease in funding for student 
services in his budget. The ·Guardian feels 
implementing this plan would be disas-
trous for the admi nistrat ion , because stu-
dents would erupt over the decrease in 
services available to them and the lack of 
control they had over their funds. 

We think the administration was correct in 
its decision to postpone a final decision on 
how to expand Priee Center as the options 
currently debated fail to satisfactorily solve 
the problem. 

Implementing Watson's idea of decreasing 
funding to student services comes at no 
worse time, because ollr school is in the 
process of expanding enrollment. 

The administration needs to give more 
money to fund these services and certainly 
should not take money away. We believe stu-
dents should not have to suffer from a lack of 
services so students of the future can have 
more food options and shorter lines. In addi-
tion, the plan would cause staff members 
from some departments, such as the dean's 
offices, to be laid off to free up money. That is 
not right either. 

Keeping the budgets of student services 
the same next year and spending extra 
time to come up with a solution for the 
expansion is in the best interest of both 
the students and the administration . 
Spending an extra year to decide will give 
students a chance to propose another fee 
referendum, if that is what they chose to 
do, and it will give the administration a 
chance to derive a better plan that makes 
all parties happy. 

Members of the new A.S. Council have 
al ready discussed having a new referen-
dum for next year if they get the support 
of the student body. The referendum 
would most likely just include the expan-
sion of the University Centers and there-
fore would cost considerably less money 
to students. 

The Guardian feels that an increase in 
tuition by $10 is a lot better than a 
decrease in student services like Student 
Health by 10 percent. 

Most services arc underbudgeted to 
begin with, and implementing this plan 
would make problems dramatically worse. 
Mure importantly than the University 

enters expansion itself, the Guardian 
believes that funding for all stl:ldent ser-
vices under Watson, such as Student Dis-
abi lities, Student Organizations and Lead-
ership Opportunities, and Psychologica l 
Services sh6uld not decrease.

An Interview With Fortner A.S. 
Council President, Doc Khaleghi 

Graduating senior reminiscences about his role in the admin istration and talks 
about what he would have done differently if he had the chance 

By TOM vu 
Opinion Editor 

Last week was the final week that Doc 
Khaleghi served as president of the A.S. 
Council. Being a senior, I've been 
through several administrations now, 
and [ must say that this administration , 
the one headed by Khaleghi , has accom-
plished much. Khaleghi has been per-
haps the most prolific and involved of 
recent presidents. 

I recently sat down with Khalegh i . 
and asked him a few questions about h is 
administration and some campus 
issues, such as commencement and the 
future state of parking. After a frank and 
open discussion, [ was convinced tha t 
Kha[eghi has been a successful A.S. 
president, involved in many campus 
issues and able to bring about worth- . 
while changes to our campus. Here is an 
abridged transcript of our conversa-
tion : 

Tom Vu: So how would you rate 

something that had to be fought for; it 
was just something that had to be initiat-
ed and shown it could benefit all parties 
involved. 

Another thing we're working on that 
students really love is moving Plus Card 
off campus. Again, the administration 
has a benefit there because they get a 
certain portion of Pl l;Is Card money that's · 
spent. And students have a benefi t 
because there are more places they can 
use Plus Card money. 

But in terms of the potential of the 
office, I know I could have done more. 
There was time I had to divert some-
times; I'm applying to med schools 
right now. Every couple of days I had to 
go'to an interview or I had to fill out an 
application, so I didn't devote 100 per-
cent of my time to the office. I devoted 
as much time as I could, though. There 
could 've been more done with the 
office than I did with it, but I think I 
accomplished a lot, especially compar-
ing myself with my predecessors. 

your tenure h ere as A.S. president, TV: How did you guys settle on 
compared to previous ones? Patch Adams as commencement 

Doc Khaleghi : Well, compared to pre- speaker? I mean, I've heard lots of 
vious A.S. presidents, [ think I've been criticism about how it's only Patch . 
ab le to accomplish a lot more, and that's Adams. [Some say] "Look at what 
just because [ th ink my ideas have been we've had before ... "

what the admin istration wants is not so you're always going to hear criticism.

An example of that would be com- someone they recognize. Well, people

approach from a different perspective tact those top choices, and we were for-

benefit the campus as a whole, including resents more than just medicine. He is

much of a struggle and happened a lot knowledge and using that knowledge to

. pus, probably at RIMAC Field . It wasn't - now they have' ·this responsibility to 

serve, and hopefully Patch Adams will 
deliver that message. 

TV: What's left for the incoming 
president to take care of? 

DK: I think they need to continue to 
pursue what I've been pursuing regard-
ing housing. . 

In terms of parking, I've been suc-
cessful. I've been the first president that's 
been able to get more yellow spaces, and 
I've used many arguments to get those 
spaces. I think we need to keep on con-
tinuing with the arguments, especially 
with the way parking's been. 

They need to take the time to discov-
er what students really want and see how 
they don't necessarily need to vie to get 
these things accomplished. And once 
they've realized that, they'll accomplish 
so much. But if they just pursue the idea 
that [fighting] politically looks good, in 
terms of UI ·Iook good when I fight the 
administration," but don't really get any-
where, then I don't think they'll be suc-
cessful. 

TV: It was evident in previous A.S. 
elections that large amounts of stu-
dents are apathetic toward elections. 
Many consider the Associated Stu-
dents as inconsequential and point-
less, more as a resume builder and a 
popularity contest than anything else. 
How do you respond? 

DK: They are rigllt. The Associated 
Students, I think, ooes have a lot of 
people that are in it for resume build-
ing. I think Associated Students is a 
huge popUlarity contest. And I think for 
many people, Associated Students does 
not have a huge consequence on thei r 
life, but that's just because. we're not 
doing our full potential. That's not say-
ing Associated Students does not have 
the ability; it's just that we're not doing 
it yet. And we need to, because we have 
a lot of people in it for the wrong rea-
son. We need to have people who gen-
uinely care and are willing to fight ... or

Music Brings Us All Together 
No 

Angel 
ANGELA CARRIER 

N ever has the Price Center served such an honor-able and worthy pur-
pose, and never have I 

seen so many students overflow 
out onto Library Walk, too 
intrigued to walk o n . If you 
weren't in the Price Center at 
noon last Tuesday, then you truly 
missed a show. Not only was 
Ozomatli amazing, but the pur-
pose behind the gathering, to 
protest the low wages of janitors, 
was even more compelling. 

The student activism behind 
the event was incredible, and is 
hopefu lly a step that will lead to 
more events of such nature. T he 
fliers passed o ut by the activists 
informed the crowd of what was 
being protested and the need to 
Uresist apathy by building our 

cons~iousness through social 
and political education ." 

The event brought to light 
many truths that we as students 
take for granted, such as the peo-
ple who keep the campus clean 
and comfortable fo r students 
who don't give a second thought 

to how it got that way. It was 
refreshing to see such displays of 
protest carried out in a construc-
tive yet festive manner. 

T he incorporation of a band 
such as Ozomadi was awesome 
and ingenious. Music is an art 
form that brings people together; 
they drop their guards and sing 
in unison, forgetting their differ-
ences and prejudices. 

I once asked a group of inter-
national students what their def-
inition of a uWorld Culture" is, 
and a Japanese student answered 
with the single word: music. 
There is an unexplainable ele-
ment of music that can create 
unity among people. And the 
artists themselves have the abili-
ty to use the micropho nes to do 
more than just sing their songs 
and play their instruments -
they can speak out to an audi-
ence that will listen. Though not 
everyone may agree with what is 
said, they will still listen. 

And to have the attention of 
such a captive aud ience will 
help to ensure that the message 
will be heard, and that people 
will act upon what they hear. 
Since the march with janitors 
was planned to be after the 
Ozomatli concert, there were 
more people willing to join in 
- they heard what it was all 
about. It was good to see such a 

successful protest carried out 
on a campus usually void of any 
collective student action . 

It is also necessary to realize 
that the group that organized the 
event was the Latino student 

. community, a minority on this 
campus. Its efforts are more than 
admirable, and highly com-
mended. If a relatively small 
group can create such a gather-
ing of students and faculty, 
imagine what would happen if 
the majority of the student pop-
ulation put its efforts into some-
thing more than events for self-
gratification. 

Last Tuesday showed me the 
part of the college experience 
that many people are missing. 
Just because this campus is 
designed to deter large student 
gatherings and protests, it does-
n't mean that they are wrong or 
impossible. The events of last 
Tuesday dispelled that myth , 
and with that barrier broken 
down, it will hopefully open the 
floodgates of events. 

There is so much more to 
education than books and 
exams. There are events around 
the world and right in our face 
that crave attention , and 
activism waiting to be embraced 
by those students who can eas-
ily shed the apathy for some-
thing more. 

OPINION 5 

The Perils Of Being 
A Liberal Arts Major 
By VALERIE BURNS 
Staff Writer 

[ would like to bring a piece of 
news to the attention of Chancellor 
Dynes: Not all UCSD students are 
science majors. The way the school 
is being run indicates that no one 
has told the chancellor. 

At UCSD, being a liberal arts 
major is equivalent to being a sec-
ond-class citizen. The academics at 
UCSD are weighted toward the sci-
ences, which causes the whole uni· 
versity to sponsor the sciences more 
than the liberal arts. Countless pro-
grams, scholarships and jobs are 
offered only to science majors. 

I'm not stupid - I'm well aware 
that UCSD developed out of the 
research-oriented Scripps Institu-
tion of Oceanography. But that was 
40 years ago, and it seems as if the 
liberal arts are still scratching the 
surface of funding resources, while 
the science departments are knee-
deep in cash. 

How does Dynes think this 
unfai r dispersal of funds affects stu-
dents? Academia is supposed to be 
the one arena where eq uality is 
stressed, where knowledge is cher-
ished, no matter from what disci-
pline. Yet the academic environment 
at UCSD encourages liberal arts 
majors (I dare not say nonscience 
majors) to develop an inferiority 

complex. I believe th is same complex 
stifles their intellectual growth here 
at our grea t research university, 
helping to fonn a vicious cycle in 
which liberal arts majors look upon 
their major with apathy. It is hard to 
find a reason to expand academic 
departments when the students of 
those majors are not ambitious. But, 
after all this explanation as to why 
they are, who could blame them? 

I think my strong feelings revolv· 
ing around this issue arise from my 
Revelle college student status. I am 
greatly in the minority here at 
MCAT - I mean premed, er uh -
Revelle college. I vividly remember 
how the first week of school fresh -
man year, there was a lready a 
premed forum . How do you think 
that makes a scared, undeclared 
freshman feel? And let me assure 
you, there was no law school fo rum 
to complement the premed forum . 

Ahh, Revelle - the renaissance 
college. There is nothing renaissance 
about it. The general education 
requirements consist of a bunch of 
social science classes, a foreign lan-
guage requirement, the humanities 
sequence and premed courses. 111e 
one bright light in Revelle is the 
humanities. I am grateful for the 
opportunity to break the seal of this 
sacred canon of books summarizing

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

Scientists Unwisely Play Role of ~God' 
Controversial fertility procedure may lead to devastating results 
By PARISA BAHARIAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The revolutionary new fertility 
procedure conceived by ew Jersey 
scientists that spawned the birth of 
the world's first 15 genetically mod-
ified babies is a frightening example 
of the lengths to which science will 
go to achieve the miracle of birth. 

TIle technique seems like some-
thing from an episode of the "X-
Files." Doctors take an egg from an 
infertile woman, an egg from ' a 
donor woman and sperm from the 
infertile WJman's mate. The doctors 
suck out the cytoplasm of the 
donor egg with a microscopic'nee-
die. The cytoplasm is then injected 
into the inferti le woman's egg, 
along with the sperm, to fertilize it. 

The doctors believe the proce-
dure helps women who are unable 
to conceive because of defects in 
their eggs. These doctors 110W have 
15 babies to put up on their 
pedestal of scientific marvels. 

But the controversy doesn't end 
there. The new fertility treatment 
creates one child who has DNA 
from two biological mothers. How 
is this possible? According to Dr. 
Jacques Cohen, scientific director of 
assisted reproduction at the insti-
tute that produced the embryos, the 
method can introduce mitochondr-
ial DNA from the female donor's 
egg into the mix of genetic material 

from the mother and father. The 
institute took blood tests and con-
firmed that two of the 15 babies 
produced at the institute were car-
rying genetic material from the 
birth mother, the father and the 
woman who donated an egg. While 
this treatment is a blessing and a 
miracll' for those infertile couples, it 
warran:s a look at the prov·:n and 
potential consequences. 

The most glaring concern 
expressed by many dissidents is that 
the procedure is unethical because 
it leaves a child with three biological 
parents. 

Cohen responded to these criti-
cisms in an interview with Reuters, 
saying, "I don't think this is wrong 
at all . And I think we have to look at 
the positive part here. I think this 
did work. TIlese babies wouldn't 
have been born if we wouldn't have 
done this." 

Cohen's answer to the critics of 
the controversial procedure is quite 
telling and rather surprising. Like a 
seasoned politician, he deftly side-
stepped addressing the critics' con-
cerns and steamrolled to his 
mantra: "Look at the positive part 
here ... this did work." 

The response that "this did 
work" as an excuse for the risky 
procedure is completely arrogant 
and reckless, for it reveals the doc-
tor's belief that achieving the end 
result IS all that maners. It is obvi-

ous that the doctors had no con-
cern for the fact that they were 
experimenting with real babies. 

Cohen's moiee to duck those 
valid concerns raised by critics begs 
the question: What are you trying to 
hide? 

The statemen t that "these babies 
wouldn't have been born if we 
wouldn't have done this" is shock-
ing. Do the ends justify whatever 
the means may be? The big picture 
and ramifications for the future are 
more important than having those 
babies at any cost. 

Cohen is so shortsighted thar he 
doesn't see what he has created 
with these genetically modified 
babies. The tri-genetic code will be 
passed down to future generations. 
Though the consequences of play-
ing with and modifying the genetic 
code of these babies and their 
future babies are not yet known, it 
is obvious that the doctors have 
derailed the course of nature. 

Who's to say what the future 
consequences are for such genetic 
modification via this fertility proce-
dure? While the world waits for the 
answer, other doctors in the United 
States continue to experiment and 
create genetically modified babies. 

However, the concerns about 
this procedure and the unknown 
costs are so strong that Britain has 
banned the fertility procedure. 

Britain's Human Fertilization 

and Embryology Authority has not 
licensed researchers to use the 
technique, on the basis that it does 
not have a proven safety record and 
could let in germline genetic modi-
fication, which would allow for the 
introduction of deliberate genetic 
chagges into human embryos -
the changes that will be inherited by 
their offspring when they are con-
ceived. 

Many people view germline 
engineering as a qualitative shift in 
the history of human intervention 
in natural processes that may take 
us an irrevocable step toward self-
creation, or self-destruction. Others 
see such fears as exaggerated, based 
on scientific misunderstanding or 
irrational fears. 

Since there is no proof yet, any 
sort of definite conclusion drawn 
from these two extreme views will 
be merely guesswork. 

How far will science go in the 
realm of genetic modifications? 
How much will they tinker and toy 
with the future of our very human-
ity? 

I f the doctors' objectives are to 
get the baby born regardless of the 
consequences, I shudder to think 
what these scientists have in store 
for us. Once we allow this new fer-
tility procedure. it will be down the 
medical ethical slippery slope for us 
all. Anything and everything will be 
fair game. Just watch.

Interview: 
A. S. Council must fight 
for students' issues 
ContInued froIII ..... . 4 
ideas that really help students, 
and not fight for ambiguous 
things that could indirectly h~lp 
the student body, like revising our 
own constitution or things like 
that. But things that students can 
actually feel, like having Plus off 
campus - students will anually 
feel that; they'll not:ce that. And 
when those kinds of things hap-
pen, people will recognize that 
Associated Students was conse-
quential in their lives. 

1V: So what is going on with 
the parking situation right 
now? OK: I'm optimistic ... and I 
really like some of the things that 
are going on. We're talking about a 
lot of new ideas. For people that 
do fight for parking, they're kind 
of focusing on "more yellow 
spaces, more yellow spaces." There 
are more things that we can do 
than just having more yellow 
spaces. Some things are going to 
happen in the next few weeks -
for example, there are safety issues 
in terms of "What about people 
that get to campus late at night?" 
What are they going to do? Right 
now I want to make it so that a 
person can park in any space on 
campus until at least lOin the 
morning. No more of this "7:45

don't think that's safe; I don't 
think it 's proper. 

We're working on new permit 
systems. We're trying to move to a 
UCLA system, where other factors 
are evaluated in terms of where you 
can park and how much your per-
mit is, so that certain people -
maybe they have off campus jobs, 
who have to deal with commuting a 
lot more - might have bener park-
ing privileges than maybe an on-
campus resident who maybe moves 
his car once a month. And you can 
put that in, and it'll get me blasted 
by a lot of residents, but it's about 
doing what's right. Commuters 
come -to this -campus every day. 
People that work off-campus daily, 
they need access to the heart of the 
campus more than a resident who 
doesn't commute very much. 

1V: Was it difficult to come 
into the office after Tesh 
Khullar? Was it hard to clean 
up the mess he left behind? 

DK: The first two weeks, yeah. 
1 would send campus-wide e-
mailS and people would reply "I 
don't trust Associated Students 
anymore, screw you," those kinds 
of things. And that's tough . You 
have an image to clean up. I said, 
"You know what, I just have to 
work as hard as I can. I'm not 
Tesh, and I'm going to have to 
show that to people." You 've got to 
go the extra level. 

For example, I have a $500 
operating account; 1 don't think 
I've spent $50 of it. 1 want students 
to trust that I'm not going to waste 
their money. You've just got to 
show that you go to work hard 
and you 've got to keep communi-

cating with students. I don't think 
anyone remembers any more. If 
they do, they don't associate that 
with Associated Students in gen-
eral. 

1V: What advice do you have 
for the incoming officials? 

DK: Don't worry about your 
image. If you care too much about 
your image, you won't get any-
thing done. There'll always be 
ideas, plans that you want to do 
that some people won't like and if 
you try to please those people, you 
won't get shit done. 

You've got to be able to look 
bad. I know I've looked bad many 
times this year 'cause of different 
things, but it's for what I thought 
was right. Do what you think is 
right; don't necessarily consider 
yourself an ad~rsary to anyone. 
Work with people, and that's the 
way you'll get the most done. But 
don 't go for popularity; go for 
accomplishment. 

1V: If there were one thing 
you could change about UC5D 
with a snap of your finger, what 
would it be? 

DK: It 's kind of vague. UCSD

is a very beautiful campus, but 
sometimes that's given priority 
over other things, and I would 
change that. Examples of that 
would [be] housing. We could 
build lots of cheap housing very 
quickly, but it wouldn 't be that 
pretty, and so certain groups on 
campus wouldn 't let that hap-
pen . We could build mu ch 
cheaper, bigger parking struc-
tures so that it wouldn't cause 
permit costs to go up so much. 

This isn 't the fault of the park-
ing [office], this isn't the fault of 
the housing [office]. There are so 
many layers of bureaucracy to the 
campus that it has to [get] 
through . And I would change that, 
because sometimes students' 
needs and students' happiness 
and students' livability, in terms of 
costs, is a lot more important than 
how pretty your place is. 

1V: So what's in store for the 
future of Doc? 

DK: I'm applying to med 
school. I don 't know where I'm 
going yet. Hoping to hear from 
some good schools that I got in, 
but I don 't know. I'll j ust sit and 
wait for a few weeks. 

Perils: 
Administration often 
ignores liberal arts majors 
Continued from page 5 
the events of western civilization . 

But even in humanities, there is a 
lot left to be desired. The professors 
have been wonderful, the books 
great, the TAs satisfactory. The stu-
dents, awful! And they say that the 
only people at UCSD who can write 
are Revellians! The quality of writing 
in humanities is not high. Humani-
ties is Revelle's half-assed attempt to 
distance itself from the researm-
minded aspect of the rest of UCSD, 
when in fact Revelle's own GEs 
require practically every liberal arts 
major to fulfill the prebio require-
ments. 

Let me ask those in charge at 
Revelle college: How does one 
acquire renaissance status when 
one simply adds some social sci-
ence requirements to the prebio 
GEs? It's not as if these social sci-
ence requirements are taken seri-
ously. Any informed Revelle stu-
dent knows he can satisfy any of 
them either at a community college 
or at summer school. On the other 
hand, the science courses cannot 
be satisfied at a community college. 
A doubk standard, maybe? Renais-
sance, my ass! 

Let me pose a question: Why are 
there science classes for liberal arts 
majors, but no liberal arts classes for 
science majors? Are the liberal al1s 
so easy at UCSD that they require 
no screening at all? 

The whole division of science 
classes seems like a ploy to recruit 
more science majors to the univerSI-
ty. It 's equivalent to separa ting the 
elite from the masses. Who would 
right-mindedly choose the masses? 
1 spent my whole fi rst year at Revelle 
being a science major, when in real-
ity I was undeclared. But I wanted to 
take all the science courses "j ust in

case" I happened to join the ditl' 
and become a science major. The 
same silUation I lived Ihrough 
would not .:xi t for potential liberal 
arts majors. 

Personally. I have taken one non-
science class here at UCSD: physics 
11 A. The academic environmelll 
was apathetic. TI1C standards were 
set so low for this class that it caused 
riots of laughter among the studt·nls. 
TIle ease of this class made' me slllik 
and puke si multaneously. It was dis-
turbing that I could flunk thl' 
quizzes, and with the curve, slill get 
an A. The student apathy for thiS 
class was so strong that the professor 
had no choice but to set the curw 
extremely low so that nobody would 
flunk . Why would such a silLlation 
occur here at our prestigious univer-
sity? 

The simple fact of how liberal 
arts majors are addressed at UCSD 
is disturbing. We are not liberal arts 
majors, are we? What are we mo t 
commonly referred to as? 0:on-
science majors? So, by cOntrdSt. arc 
science majors ever non-liberal il rtS 
majors? Is the shift of priori lies "t 
UCSD so great that in orda ftll'

I've been having doubts latdy.

Maybe Revelle is one big prelllt'ti

............ D & NATION 
u.s. Assures South Korea That It 
Will Resume Talks With North 

Mexico:. 
Fox's approval rating slips 
after Indian rights bill 

euphoric public support that Fox 
had received for vanquishing the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party 
which had ruled Mexico for 71 
years. "After five months in office, 
Fox has shown that he is entertain-
ing, but he is not convincing." SEOUL, South Korea - A vis-

iting senior U.S. envoy assured 
President Kim Dae-jung on 
Wednesday that the United States 
would resume its dialogue with 
North Korea. 

Richard Armitage, deputy secre-
tary of state, said he expe'ted the 
United States and ol1h Korea 
would be able to hold talks "in the 
near future" after Washington 
completes a review of policy regard-
ing the NOl1h "in a few weeks." 

President Bush underlined the 
point, according to Kim's 
spokesman , in a lener Armitage 
delivered, which promised to 
·strongly support the South's 
engagement policy on the NOl1h ." 

Armitage met Kim soon after 
arriving here from Japan, the first 
country on his mission to person-
ally present Bush's proposal on a 
national missile defense system to 
Asian leaders. He leaves Thursday 
for India. 

Armitage 'S remarks on the 
North were made after a 70-
minute meeting with Kim, who 
has repeatedly called for a renewal 
of U.S.-North Korean talks in 

North Korea has waged 
an intense propaganda 
campaign since March, 
calling on the United 
States to withdraw its 
37,000 troops from the 
South. 
order to revive the stalled dialogue 
between NOl1h and South Korea. 

The U.S. expectation of 
renewed dialogue with the North 
came two months after Bush cited 
problems of · verification" of any 
agreement with the North on stop-
ping the production, testing or 
export of missiles. Bush had ruled 
out resuming the negotiations . 
begun during the Clinton adminis-
tration before a policy review. 

North Korea has waged an 
intense propaganda campaign 
since March , calling on the 
United States to withdraw its 
37,000 troops from the South. 
The North has also canceled 
Cabinet-level meetings with the 

South and failed to sign an agree-
ment for rebuilding a rail link 
across the demilitarized zone that 
divides the two Koreas. 

During his meeting with 
Armitage, Kim Dae-jung offered 
"understanding' of the U.S. posi-
tion on missile defense. He avoid-
ed any commitment while calling 
for continuity in U.S. policy 
toward North Korea. 

At the same time, Kim Dae-
jung urged the United States "to 
push the plan' for national missile 
defense "through close consulta-
tion with its allies and other 
nations concerned in a way that 
promotes world peace and securi-
ty: his spokesman said. 

The careful wording of the 
comment reflected South Korea 's 
fear that the missile defense plan 
will undermine relations with 
China and Russia, North Korea's 
strongest allies in the Korean War. 
Chinese and Russian leaders have 
made clear their complete opposi-
tion to the idea.

ending the 1994 indigenous 
Zapatista uprising in Chiapas. But 
indigenous groups opposed the 
amendments. 

Then the Congress shelved 
another Fox initiative: a bill intend-
ed to bring fiscal reform, which 
would have allowed for new taxes 
on foods and medicines. 

On May Day, thousands of 
demonstrators in Mexico City'S 
central plaza carried posters that 
expressed outrage at Fox's tax plan, 
which many workers say would tax 
them instead of the rich. Others, 
wearing the black ski masks that 
have become the Zapatista rebel 
signature, burned effigies of the 
president. And on Monday, the 
influential newspaper Reforma 
published a poll indicating that 
Fox's approval rating had slipped 
below 70 percent for the first time 
since he was elected, to 65 percent. 
Only 15 percent of those asked said 
they believed most of what the 
president said when he addressed 
the nation . 

"The 'democratic bonus' has 
been spent: said Soledad Tovar 
Loaeza, a political scientist at the 
Colegio de Mexico, referring to the 

Fox's popularity and perfor-
mance ratings remain enviably 
high, and the 58-year-old president 
continues to be a star on the world 
stage. However it has become clear 
that the widespread euphoria over 
Fox's election has given way to a 
crabby debate' about his pro-busi-
ness policies, his inability to nego-
tiate political alliances with the 
Congress and the dissonant mes-
sages his government sometimes 
projects. 

But some analysts point to what 
they see as positive steps by Fox, 
including high-profile moves 
against corruption and drug traf-
ficking. And on Monday, several 
Mexican newspapers reported that 
Fox had begun investigations into 
charges of corruption by several 
former high-ranking public offi-
cials. 

Jorge Chabat, with the Center 
for Economic Research and 
Teaching, said, "I think Fox still has 
several aces up his sleeve, to help 
him with his popularity in the 
coming months."

Panel Reaches Budget Framework Deal Stocks: a company to buy shares, often at a discount to the prevailing market 
price. While companies don't like 
selling their shares at a discount, 
getting some money is usually bet-
ter than getting none. 

WASHI GTON 
Republicans in the Senate and a 
handful of moderate Democrats 
reached a final deal Tuesday night 
on how much money to allocate 
to tax cuts and spending, and 
Republicans and Democrats on 
the Senate Finance Committee 
intensified their talks over how to 
appol1ion the tax reductions. 

The committee's Republican 
chairman. Sen. Charles Grassley 
of Iowa, met tWice Tuesday with 
the senior Democrat on the panel, 
Sen . Max Baucus of Montana, and 
said they were making progress 
toward a tax bill that could attract 
some bipartisan support. 

Grassley said the bill they are 
working on would include all four 
of the main elements sought by 
President Bush in his proposal to 
cut taxes by more than $1.6 tril-
Iton over the next decade. They 
are a reduction in all income tax 
rates. an II1crease in the child 
credit. a tax break for married 
couples and repeal of the federal 
estate tax. 

Grassley said the bill 
would not cut the top 
personal income tax rate 
to 33 percent from 39.6 
percent, as Bush wants. 

But in part because the budget 
plan will provide less for tax cuts 
than the $1 .6 trillion sought by 
Bush - $1 .25 trillion over the 
next decade, plus another $100 
billion for tax cuts this year and 
next year to give the flagging 
economy a boost - Grassley said 
the committee would scale back 
and modify each component of 
the Bush proposal. 

Grassley said the bill would 
not cut the top personal income 
tax rate to 33 percent from 39.6 
percent, as Bush wants. 
Congressional aides and senators 
from both parties said they now 
expect a compromise that would 
reduce the top rate to around 36 
percent, and a reduction in the 

current 36 percent rate to about 
33 percent. 

"We're going to have a reason-
able compromise on the top rate: 
Grassley said. 

There is general agreement on a 
few points. Members of both par-
ties want to create a new tax brack-
et below the current 15 percent 
bracket to give all taxpayers an 
immediate tax cut this year. And 
Grassley has said he intends to take 
some steps to deal with the alterna-
tive minimum tax, which was creat-
ed to reduce tax avoidance by 
upper income people but now sub-
jects increasing numbers of middle 
income taxpayers to higher tax bills. 

The debate over how much to 
limit the reduction in the top 
income tax rate of 39.6 percent is 
one of the most ideologically: con-
tentious, but members of both par-
ties said arithmetic is likely to dri.ve 
the outcome.

Acqua Wellington saves 
Igen from bankruptcy 
Continued from ...,. 1 
to purchase up to $60 million of 
new Igen shares over 28 months. 
Igen, a medical diagnostics compa-
ny based in Gaithersburg, Md. , has 
already taken advantage of the offer 
to raise $25 million. 

Acqua Wellington has offered 
similar deals to about a dozen 
biotech . companies in the 16 
months it has been in existence, 
creating a stir among biotech exec-
utives akin to that of suddenly dis-
covering one has a rich uncle. And 
no wonder. 

With technology and biotech 
companies finding it nearly impos-
sible now to sell stock to the pub-
lic, money offered by funds like 
Acqua Wellington is providing a 
lifeline for many companies. 

Such financings are known as 
private investments in public equi-
ties, or PIPEs. An investor or group 
of investors negotiates directly with 

"There's a recognition that 
PIPEs are -going to be the only 
means of financing companies this 
year and maybe into next year," 
said Brian M . Overstreet, president 
of DirectPlacement.com Inc., an 
investment bank that tracks such . 
deals. 

But there is a risk as well. Some 
desperate companies agree to such 
onerous terms that the financing 
can hurt more them help. These 
are called "toxic" or "death-spiral" 
financings and can result in severe 
dilution of the value of existing 
shares, hurting other shareholders. 
The mere announcement tltat a 
company has done such a deal can 
send its stock into a tailspin from 
which it may never recover. 

Only about 10 percent of PIPEs 
are toxic, said Overstreet.

Proud: 
Week includes film 
screenings and dance 
Continued from ...,. 1 
not narrow: 

Muir sophomore Tomas 
Bogardus echoed Kim's senti-
ments about the need for 
increased acceptance and love on 
the part of the heterosexual com-
munity. 

"Passive acceptance is no longer 
sufficient: Bogardus said. "It's our 
responsibility to actively challenge 
our preconceptions and prejudices, 
however latent, and become a com-
munity: 

Promoters of the "Out and 
Proud Week' wanted to stress that 
the events are for everyone. 

Principal · member of the 
LGBTA Erin Harvell addressed this 
issue. 

MIt's not about 'Let's be queer 
week:' Harvell said. "It's about, 
'Let's be aware. Let's be under-
standing. Let's be considerate.' 
No one wants to take over the 
world. They just want to be a part 
of it." 

Muir junior Mikey Kaufmann 
concurred with Harvell . 

"We're trying to bring the cam-
pus together to talk about diverse 

i~sues that affect everyone: he 
said. 

The rally also hosted alternative 
rock band Water Gypsies. 

The band played two sets at the 
Price Center, singing about a vari-
ety of issues including the mistreat-
ment of homosexuals. 

In one song about hate crimes 
against homosexuals, the group 
cried out, · When will this be 
enough?' 

Other events during the week 
included a screening of two films 
on Monday night at the Price 
Center Theater. 

At 7 p.m. Monday the LGBTA 
sponsored a showing of the docu-
mentary "A Boy Named Sue: by 
Julie Wyman. 

The film is about a woman 
who undergoes a sex-change 
operation and his experience in 
the world. 

The night also .featured a short 
film by Bill Basquin titled "The 
Ride: 

There was also a panel of 
UCSD professors fielding ques-
tions from the audience. 

Saturday will mark the second 
annual queer youth conference, 
themed "Generation Q: Building 
SolIdarity Through Diversity: pre-
sented by the Queer People of 
Color at UCSD. 

The conference runs from 
10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. with a special 
film screening from 6:30 p.m. to 
8:30 p.m. 

The bi-quarterly LGBTA 
dance at Porter's Pub will be from 
9 p.m. to 1 a.m. 

All events are free and open to 
people of all orientations. 

Promoters of the dance expect a 
large turnout. 

Students can register for the 
conference online at 
http://www.jlamingart.clJI1l, a Web site 
highlighting the work of Scott 
David Heath . • 

The rally was perceived as a 
success, although some students 
were concerned with the lack of 
support and the low number of 
people in attendance. 

Newly appointed Campus 
Organizing Director for the A.S. 
External Office Alicia Schwartz 
said, "I'd like to see more involve-
ment and less apathy, more allies, 
more people joining the struggle 
for solidarity: 

The LGBTA holds its general 
meetings at 7 p.m. on Mondays in 
the Graduate Student Association 
Lounge on the first floor of the 
Student Center. 

Students of all orientations are

to the thought of the cold 

beer that wi ll soothe the nerves and relax the 
soul. You can almost hear the delightful 
"SSStl" as the bonle cap flies off and tinkers 
around the counter. The slight scent of the 
precious yeast-based brew reaches your 
nose. You can almost imagine the cool feel of 
the bottle resting carefully in the palm of 
your hand while you kick off your shoes, sit 
in your favorite chair and just unwind. 

You finally reach your home and you 
dash inside, ignoring the pi le of bills. and 
leaping over the cat that decided it wants 
attention today. You reach the smooth han-

open and then just as you are about to 
reach inside for a beer, you face a moral 
deCISion. A dilemma. A quandary, if you 
will. Will it be the Lady or the Tiger? Dcfi-

Beer: 
Dilemma of choosing beverages 
soLved with beer matchup 
Continued from ..... 10 
nitely a predicament. 

What beer do you choose?! 
Now, if your home is anything like mine, 

there is usually a wide selection of beer to 
choose from and I am often left wondering 
whether I should reach for the Karl Strauss 
Amber Lager, the Newcastle or the Guin-
ness. So many choices. . 

But there's not much time to decide as 
your mouth begins to dry out in anticipation 
of this cool beverage. You are thinking to 

yourself, what should I drink? Which one is 
better? Why? 

You might say to yourself, "It's just beer." 
But no, it's not "just beer." Every beer has 

its own unique style, texture and taste. 
And just in time for the Sun God Festival. 

where many revelers will partake in the mass 
consumption of alcoholic beverages, The 
Guardian staff members have taken the liber-
ty of conducting painstaking research in 
judging the overall quality and taste of vari-
ous beers. 

We matched up various beers and rated 
their quality against each other. The beers 
were then individually rated on a 1 to 10 
scale, 1 being piss poor, 10 being the best of 

. the best and 5 simply being an average beer 
that wouldn't be too bad on any given night.

BEER vs. BEER ~

The two beer giants of Japan square off in 
an epic banle of taste and overall quality. 

. But it appears that Sapporo falls short in 
th is battle. Sapporo has a lighter texture and 
a slightly more watered-down taste. The bi t-
terness of the in itia l flavor is much like the 
init ia l taste of Budweiser: It's not tha t bad, 
but you kind of have to fo rce it down . 

The Asahi, on the other hand, proves why 
it is touted as "Japan's No. 1 Beer." The overall 
taste ~ very dry and smooth. There is no bitter 
taste or aftertaste, and it is th icker overall. The 
darker quality of this beer gives it more flavor 
and character. This is truly "the beer for all sea-
sons: as it boldly states on the label. Both can 
go well with any meal, especia lly sushi . The 
Sapporo, although lacking in overall quality, 
can be a refreshing drink after a heavy meal, 
but the Asahi can fully compliment any dish 
at your local Japanese restaurant.

The duel between Killarney'S Red Lager 
and Foster's Lager ended with the U.S. product 
thoroughly embarrasing the Aussie brew in the 
categories of presentation, smell and taste. 

While Foster's does have the advantage of 
coming in a pint-sized can, the gaudy blue 
and gold behemoth doesn't compare to the 
look of the Killarney'S bonle, nor to the way 
it comfortably fits in one's hand. 

Smelling the Foster's beer brings back 
unpleasant memories of cheap keg beer, 
while a whiff of the rich , deep aroma of the 
red lager resulted in a heightened anticipa-
tion of drinking the brew. 

The smooth taste of the Killarney's lager 
hits at the back of the throat, where all good 
beers should register, and carries out the 
promise made by its smell. Foster's, on the 
other hand, had a somewhat lighter taste. 
which becomes more apparant as the bottom 
of the can approaches. Foster's receives a score 
of 5 out of 10 due to its lack of spectacularity, 

despite its advantage when drinking mass 
quantities. Killarney'S earns a score of 7, hurt 
by the fact that it's an Anheuser-Busch prod-
uct, but it has the benefit of being the perfect 
beer to enjoy with dinner or during a walk 
along the beach. Just make sure it 's not Mis-
sion Beach'or Pacific Brach .

In an age when Ireland and Britain seem to 
tip-toe around each other to create some sem-
blance of peace, I have put a solid two-fingers 
up (the equivalent to the middle-finger here in 
the states) to any political repercussions. 

I have pitted Manchester's Boddingtons 
Pub Ale against Dublin's Guinness in a bat-
tle of beers. This is the next best thing to an 
England versus Ireland foo tba ll match. 

Both drinks have a deep history spanning 
over 200 years. 111e construction of each can is 
impressive as they both contain a "draught" 
system that closely recreates the taste of a Bod-
dingtons or a Guinness straight out of the tap. 
Shake the can around a little bit and you can 
hear the little widget click around. 

Guinness is a top notch beer with that 
thick, foamy taste that we have come to 
know and love. The creamy taste is surpris-
ingly easy to drink and goes down smooth 
with little bitterness. But if you rarely drink 
beer or are used to lighter beers, you may 
want to stay away from this until you have 
developed your beer-drinking chops. 

Boddingtons Pub Ale has a similar 
creamy texture but the taste is slightly lighter. 
It is also a bit sweeter with a hint of banana 
to it. Much like Guinness, Boddingtons is 
not as bitter as some beers can be. 

However, the Irish comes out on top. Guin-
ness packs a darker and thicker punch that is 
more satisfying in the end. Never experienced 
Guinness? Grab one and enjoy. Cheers!

Miller ~enuine Dran 

Budweiser and Miller Genuine Draft: One 
wonders why these relatively low-quality beers are 
worth bothering with. 11ley don't offer the rich 
taste dnd navor of many other beers that can be 
found ~t a fairly comparable price. The taste of 
both ot these beers is virtually indistinguishable 
because each has a thin navor that is reminiscent 
of watered-down urine. Trust me. 

The redeeming factor of these 1\"'0 domestic 
beers is that they are inexpensive and better 
than Natural Ice, although I know that some 
may disagree. And of course, after you force 
down about four or five bottles of Budweiser 
and MGD, you stop caring what it tastes like. 

Still. the beer connoisseur should avoid these 
two brews at all costs.

In the battlc of the cervezas from south of the 

border, Dos Equis went house on Corona and 
cruised to the easy victory. With its full, smooth 
taste, Dos Eqll1s simply overpowered the lighter, 
weaker tastc 01 Corona. 

Dos Equis is the most solid beer to come from 
our neighbor from the south . It is a darker lager 
that embodies a lot of strong qualities for a beer. It 
IS definitely a beer that you can drink a lot of and 
not get co~plctc\y sick of after only a few beers. 

Corona IS Simply the weaker beer. While it has 
become popular in the United States for its light-
ness and lack of a true beer taste. it remains a 
weak beer. It must be supplemented with salt and 
lime to get a desirable taste. Any beer that needs 
a supplement is Simply not up to par. The lime-
less taste of the beer can get old after only a few. 

The scores II1dlcate that It was a closer than it 
actually was. Dos Equis was the first beer out of 
the gate and jumped out to the early lead. [t was 
c1eal1lng ho.use until a convoluted pallet and the 
effects of dnnkll1g the Dos Equis first contributed 
to Corona scoring as well as it did later. 

It was actua lly a solid knockout for Dos 
Equis, which should be considered by anybody 
who IS 100kll1g for a solid import that they can

.Most are familiar with the green bottle of 
HClI1eken, that popular beverage brewed in the 
Netherlands. However, most are not as familiar 
with Hcincken Special Dark, which can be 
found in a dark brown borfle. 

New!=astle, on the other hand. is a beer that 
needs no introduction and has been a favorite 
(or many across the At[antic Ocean and here in 
the United States. The Special Dark and the 
"Brown Ale" seem to be a wOl1hy match up. 

One may be a bit wary of Heineken's dark beer, 
but If you are a skeptic you will be in for a surprise. 
The Hell1eken Dark obViously offers a slightly 
darker taste but has a slightly bitter aftertaste. The 
qualll~ of the beer is definitely thicker and more 
sansfYlI1g than the taste of the original Heineken. 

The Newcastle also provides a similar dark 
taste but the aftenastc is smoother than the 
Heineken Dark. Newcastle almost has a smoky 
~ste to It and the entire experience of Newcastle 
~s nearly perfect. The quality is not too dark, but it 
IS by no means as thick as a pint of Guinness. 

Th~ re lallve. newcomer, Heineken Special 
Dark, IS a. quali ty opponent but it fa lls short 
be.hind the deep history of Newcast le that was 
ongll1ally establ ished in 1770.

Karl Strauss brews an amber lager that is pop-
ular With many of the locals. With a strong taste, 
yet mild bitterness, this beer has a complex texture 
that appeals to many. The smoothness of the beer 
IS average: not the best, but also not the worst on 
the market. The malt has a rich aroma, one that 
has a sweet, almost coffee-like flavor. However, the 
aftertaste is a little dry, not leaving much to savor. 

Opening a bottle of Samuel Adams Boston 
Lager brings a foamy head that is not only rich 
but also thick. This ale has more malt and l es~ 
hops, making it both sweeter and less bitter than 
most beers. Like Karl Strauss, Sam Adams has a 
strong flavor and ends on a dry note. Although 
the taste IS stronger, the aftertaste is decent and 
the aroma is I\ot as intense. 

. In the battle between West vs. East Coast, the 
slight edge goes to Sam Adams. Although the deli-
CIOUS aroma of Karl Strauss can't be denied. its 
taste comes up short by the narrowest of margins. 

Not only does Sam Adams have a sweeter 
taste, but it is also th icker and smoother. Both 
beers complime~ t almost every meal, making 
them a good chOice for almost any occasion.

end, this movie makes a good 
attempt to entertain viewers but is 
bereft of any real content. The 
actors play their roles to perfection 
but the plot and the special effects 
take away from the movie. 

At sorne pOints there was so 
much action that the film became 
stale and predictable. Throughout 
the entire movie there was beauti-
fully realistic animation and depic-
tion of ancient Egypt. These, how-
ever, were negated by the corny 
appearances of killer pygmy mum-
mies and over-animation of evil 
enemies. 

The manner in which the o rig-
inal story was woven into the new 
one was very well done, yet the

movie failed to follow the same 
ambitious pa th established in the 
beginning. The few redeeming 
aspects of the film must be 
respec ted , though, and these 
include the subtle comedic per-
formance of John Hannah as the 
humorous troublemaker 
Jonathon, and the strength and 
serio usness of Oded Fehr as the 
leader of the Mejhi . 

Both ac tors added character and 
realism to an otherwise cheesy 
action movie. If you are in the 
mood to see an entertain ing and 
exciting movie, "The Mummy 
Returns" would be it.

Continued from page 20 
tual to all scheduled events; inter-
acting with Triton Tide, cheerlead-
ers and Pep Band; taking care of 
the costume; and reporting to the 
assistant athletic director. 

Anyone who is interested will 
have to audition. Auditions are Sun-
day, May 20 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. at 
RlMAC Arena. To be eligible, stu-
dents must be enrolled at UCSD 

full-time, fill out an application that 
can be picked up at RlMAC in the 
Intercollegiate Athletics Office and 
be present for tryouts. 

Tryouts will consist of three 
things: An interview, in which the 
potential mascot will be asked 
questions related to school spirit; a 
two- to three-minute original skit 
or improvisation while in costume, 
in front of judges; and a situational 
improv to music or a hypothetical 
game setting. 

With just over a week before 
tryouts, students who think they 
have what it takes have plenty of 
time to prepare .

It's easy to make a child smile. 
A few words of encouragement, 
maybe a special reward for a special 
performance. Parents do it all 
the time, and so do teachers. 

Good teachers are the difference 
between a child who succeeds and one 
who stumbles. They are the ones who 
make math fun and science seem like 
an adventure into another world . 

Teaching is the profession that allows 
you to see the most gratifying, 
immediate and instantaneous reward 
of a job well done - a child 's smile. 

Make a child smile. 
Take the next step - teach! 

Make the difference 
of a lifetime.

Column: 
Some professional 
athletes are out of hand 
Continued from pqe 20 

Granted, the heat of competi-
tion is fie rce. Emotions run high 
during the playoffs, as every mis-
take is thoroughly scrutinized and 
pressure to succeed is immense, 
but that is no excuse to lose control 
and chance seriously injuring a fel -
low athlete. 

These ath letes are getting paid 
millions of dollars to handle that 
pressure and have no reason to 
re lease it by injuring other play-
ers. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm all 
fo r competition. Spons can be an 
excellent release of frustration and 
pent-up energy. Putting your all 
into an athletic event can be very 
satisfying, win or lose. It is the best 
way to compete. 

Getting to the point of having 
to take emotions out on an oppo-
nent is inexcusab le. Howard 
should have been suspended and . 
given a hefty fine for his degrad-
ing actio ns. Instead he will be 
back on the court next game, 
while the Spurs' second-best 
scorer will be watching from the 
bench. 

Now is th at fair? We would like 
to think that while th is world might 
not always be fair, sports, with its 
simple rules and attraction, should 
be fa ir. In this situation, this is not 
the case. An athlete is rewarded for 
his lack of control. while another is 
punished fo r having a good posi-
tion. 

This is not how it should be. 
People don't want their kids to see 
their idol physically punishing 
someone else. What kind of mes-
sage does that send? What does 
that say to the little tikes? 

Officials should deal with this 
phenomenon swiftly. Penalties 
such as fines or suspensions would 
definetely be in order. It's not like 
athletes can't affo rd a few thousand 
dollars out of the millions that they 
make with salaries and endorse-
ments for a fin e. 

Athletes should be reminded 
of what first attracted them to the 
game: the sights and sounds, the 
feel of the ball , the adoring fans, 
the thrill of competition and the 
bonding that only teammates can 
have. 

If athletes could only remember 
during the heat of competi tion that 
it is only a game, then perhaps 
they'd focus more on achieving 
than hurting. 

What a beau tiful game that 
would be.

UCSD looks to create

Continued from .,.,e 20 
They wound up with an 8-4 victo-
ry. This, coupled with an 8-5 win at 
No. 3 doubles by Mary Hung and 
Ashley O'Nei l, gave the Tritons a 2-
1 lead going in to singles competi-
tion . 

By this point in the match the 
large crowd was rea lly getting into 
the competition. 

Head coach Liz laPlante was 
glad that the men's team, which 
had been knocked out of the play-
offs by an earl ier loss at the 
Brigham Young University-Hawaii 
on Thursday, came to the match to 
help drown out some of the cheer-
ing from Hawaii Pacific fans. 

"They had quite a big and loud 
crowd cheering for them," LaPlante 
said. "Fortunately, our men's team 
came to watch and cheered for us." 

The singles competition came 
right down to the wire. 

O'Neil had a huge showing at 
No. 1, taking out her opponent 6-
0,7-6. Hawaii took both o. 2 and 

o. 3 singles as Tadlock was unable 
to fight through her injury and 
Liao was simply overmatched.

Hung came up huge for the Tri-

remained on the COlirt. If the Tri-
tons could manage to win one of 
them, they would be able to book a 
flight to Pensacola, Fla., and the 
National Championship Tourna-
ment. 

The two matches still in doubt 
were NO. 4 and No.5 singles, fea-
turing Tritons Kristina Jansen and 
Westerman, respectively. 

Although everyone was tense. 

SPORTS 19 

Jansen ended the suspense quickly 
with a 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 triumph that 
gave her team the victory. Wester-
man's match was suspended at 6-2, 
4-6, 1-4 because the Tritons had 
already cl inched victory. 

With the win, the Tri tons move 
on to the round of 16 of the NCAA 
National Tournament and will play 
Abilene Christian University ill thL' 
fi rst round on Thursday. The Tri-
toIlS' oppo nents arc currently 
ranked 30th in thL' n.nion and 
snuck into the tournament by 
being the surpnse winner of thdr 
regional. 

When asked about the health of 
her team, LaPlante wavered. 

"Unfon unately, Lyndscy's arm 
is still hun ing her," LaPlante said. 
"But evetyonc else tS hea lt hy." 

The Tritons are the favorites ill 
the fi rst round but will need to tind 
some magic if they want to make an 
appearance in the Division II fi nals 
the way they did last year in Divi-
sion III. 

If you had to pick a coach who 
could lead her tcam 10 such a per-
formance, it would h.lVc to be 
LaPlante, whose record in Divtsion

t's terrifying to see a team-I matc sprawled motionless on the ground , as [ have several 

times. Players and fans from both 
sides put aside their rivalries and 
share a common concern for the 
injured ath lete. 

Noise from the fans, the sounds 
of the game, even time itself seems 
to StOp as the world slows down 
and realizes that th is is no more 
than just a game. 

When iI pitcher takes a line 
drive in the face, a football player 
demolishes his knce, or a basket-
ball player breaks his ankle, one 
begins to appreciate that there is 
more to life than what's in between 
the boundary lines 

Just a few days ago, the Maver-
icks ' Juwan Howard laid out the 
Spurs' Derek Anderson with an 
exceSSive, unnecessary foul , a mere 
2.5 seconds left in the first half. 
Mter falling hard and separating 
hiS right shoulder, Anderson will 
likely miss the rest of the NBA 
playoffs. 

This is ont' of the things that is 
wrong with sports today. We pay to 
see athletes perform highly skilled 
actions, not to see them lose con-
trol of themselves and injure oth-

ton on the elite squad. 

UCSD had a couple of pl ayers 
on the AII -CCAA Second Team: 
star junior pitcher Leea Harlan 
and freshman shortstop Amy 
Mettee. 

The CCM Most Valuable Play-
er was Alicia Castro, a senior short-

Mascot 
Tryouts 
Anyone has a 
shot at represent-
i ng Triton pride 
By GLORIA CHUNG 
Staff Writer 

For the first time in school his-
tory, UCSD will have a mascot next 
fall. As if it wasn't hard enough just 
to be a UCSD student, the Triton 
mascot wi ll have the task of making 
the home crowd as rowdy as it can 
be at all sporting events. 

Anyone who has an ample 
amount of school spirit should find 
the job relatively easy. When the 
mascot helps, say, the basketball 
team win in the last seconds of a 
game by keeping the Triton crowd 
energized, then all the sweating and 
hard work will be rewarded. Need-
less to say, the Triton mascot must 
be committed and dedicated to all 
of the UCSD athletic teams.

By BILL BURGER

Finals are crappy because you have to bc at 
your best at a time whcn most would rather be 
doing nothing. Nobody wants to work so hard 
after being put through the wringer for 10 weeks. 
The only bright spot is that you know it will soon 
be done. . 

The players on the UCSD women's tennis 
team have academic finals coming soon, but they 
also have something more on their plate -
nationals, which is the tennis equivalent of what 
scholars go through. 

After running all over the court and suffering 
from a plethora of injuries this year, the team final-
ly made its way to nationals on the strength of a 5-
3 win over Hawaii Pacific University last weekend. 

Going into the match, things did not look good 
for the Tritons. They were ranked lower than 
Hawaii Pacific, which meant a flight to the islands 
for an away match. Usually, traveling to paradise 
would not sound like much of a punishment, but 
jet lag can be a major factor in a high-level tennis 
match. ' 

If traveling thousands of miles was not enough, 
the Thtons' No.2 singles player, Lyndsey Tadlock, 
had a nagging arm injury for the match. She 
played through the pain, but was obviously not 
playing at 100 percent. 

All of this, in addition to the facuhat the Tri-
tons were the underdogs to begin with, made it 
look like UCSD might be in for a short postsea-
son. 

We should never have doubted the spirit of the 
blue and gold. 

In doubles, the Tritons put on a show, winning 
two of the three games and qu'ickJy establishing 
the tempo of the match. 

At No. 1, Tadlock and Stephanie Moriarty 
struggled against powerful opponents. Although 
the lritons' top duo played tough, they were never 
a threat and walked off the court with a 3-8 loss. 

It was a different story at No. 2 doubles. Julie 
Westennan and Melisa Liao were in top form and 
dominated the match from beginning to end.
