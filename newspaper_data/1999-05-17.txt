CELEBRATE: 10 to 12 thousand 
people tum out to attend Friday 
night's concert on RIMAe Field 
By Jennifer Grady 
Staff Writer 

Despite cloudy weather, UCSD 's annual cele-
bration of its unofficial mascot was forged on last 
weekend. This year's Sun God Festival. which 
spanned from Thursday to Saturday, featured 
performances in the Price Center, boOths across 
campus and a four-act concert at RIMAC Field. 

A.S. Festivals Coordinator Zach Beebee said 
an estimated 10,000 to 12,000 students attended 
the Friday-evening festivities, which featured the 
bands Cypress Hill. Reel Big Fish, Black-eyed 
Peas and UCSD's own Pimp Symphony. 

Ticket sales to non-students were limited to 
1,500 in order to keep the concert primarily for 
UCSD students and to avoid overcrowding. The 
concert, which began at 7:30 p.m., finished 
approximately at midnight. 

Beebee said that the eclectic variety of music 
appealed to the many types of UCSD ~tudent s. 

"We couldn't have asked for a beller bal-
ance," Beebee said. "Each set had a ditTerent 
aspect. With the additional funding we received 
this year,-we were able to hire four bands instead 
of the traditional three. This way, we were able to 
hire three bands of established talent, creating a 
more universal appeal." 

Beebe.e added that this was the first year that 
concert tickets sold out in advance of the show. 

The Sun God Festival officially began 
Thursday night with a live performance of Muir 
TV 's "The Gleib Show," hosted by student Ben 
Gleiberman and featuring former MTV Veejay 
Kennedy. The show, which took place in the 
Price Center Plaza, also featured the band 
Greensboro Lane. 

Beebee said that he was impressed by the 
show. 

"I was amazed at how professional, funny and 
well put-together it was," Beebee said. "It was 
neat to watch, and it tit in well with the [Sun 
God) event." 

Friday 's events began at 10:30 a.m. in the

LGIlA Celebrates Annual Out and Proud Week 
EVENT: Members say 
purpose is to educate the 
UCSD community 
ay ......... rbplan 
Guardian Reporter 

Last week, the Lesbian, Gay, 
Bisexual and Transgender 
Association (LGBTA) held its 
annual Out and Proud Week to gain 
visibility within the UCSD commu-

nity. 
Fourth year Revelle student and 

LGBTA principal member Karen 
Oberg said that opening up and 
becoming more visible to the entire 
UCSD community has been a goal 
of LGBTA in its 27 years on cam-
pus. 

Oberg added that "educating to 
encourage awareness, discussion 
and understanding of LGBT" was 
the focus of last week's event. 

The annual Out and Proud Week 
consisted of various activities rang-
ing from speeches to safe sex sem-
inars. The week was kicked off this 
year by an open microphone rally 
at the Price Center on Monday 
where people were given the 
opportunity to publicly share their 
ideas. support and eltperiences. 

Roosevelt senior and LGBTA 
principal member Kevin Emard 
said that the rally gave the opportu-

nity for the LGBTA to .ay to UCSD 
"We're here, we ' re normal people, 
we' re part of the actual UCSD 
community." 

He added that the event allowed 
UCSD students to see and under-
stand that lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender students look and act 
like heterosexual students. 

The following three days of the 
week consisted of different work-

Warren College Raises 
Money for Mak.A-Wish 
CHARITY: Organizers 
hope to be included in the 
Guiness Book of Records 
By Kendra Welnlsch 
Guardian Reporter 

Warren College Residential Life 
sponsored Common Cents last 
Saturday, a charity event to benelit 
the Make-A-Wish Foundation. 

The three-and-a-half hours 
. allotted for the oCl.:asion were fi lied 

with free carnival games, raffle 
prize give-aways. Ji ve music, food 
and pounds of coins. 

Warren junior Rosalie Escobar, 
one of the organizers of the event, 
said she estimat.es that the coins 
collected will total $2,000. 

" We're going to set the world 
rel:Ord in the most number of coins 
collected and donated by ' college 
students for a loca l charity," 
Escobar said. "We still have to get 
cleared by Cllilll!.1"S but ... we' re 
going to set it." 

ESl.:obar added that because 
there is not a current record for 
coins collected, she expects suc-
cess regardless of how much 
money the event raised. 

The day began with openi ng 
l:Omments from Deborah Takahara, 
an NBC 7/39 Morning News co-
host, as well as a speech hy the 
executi ve director of the Make-A-
Wish Foundation of San Diego, 
Ilene Hubhs. 

In her address, Hubbs explai ned 
the foundation 's mission and said 
that it is dependent "on the volun-
teers that go out and grant the wish-
es for the kids and work on our spe-

cial events." 
Huhbs added that there is no 

limit on the number of children 
whose wishes are granted by lhe 
organization. Children are selected 
by the Make-A-Wish Foundation 
based upon their illne s. She added 
that the children in the program are 
facing serious illnesses such as 
cancer and muscular dystrophy, as 
well as problems with their hearts, 
livers and kidneys. 

Hubbs said that the Make-A-
Wish Foundation offers children 
the opportunity to fuHiIl their fan-
tasies while battling diseases. 

"We come into their life at that 
time and we say stop, take a time 
out, think about something besides 
your illness, think about if you 
could have anything in the world, 
any wish come true, what would it 
he? And we make it happen," 
Hubbs said. 

Carnival games - mostly coin-
themed - circled the perimeter of 
the lawn. The "Tobinatot" booth, 
manned hy Warren seniors Charles 
Cheng and Alex Velez, featured a 
strongman wh" ~ccepled any one-
minute challenge to his proclama-
tions of strength. 

A cart race and a lo-root dash 
tested the speed of their partici-
pants. Most of the other games 
were variations on the coin-toss. 
Patrons at each booth were reward-
ed with ti ckets that ensured a 
chance at winning one of the many 
rame prizes. 

Prizes offered in the raffle 
included a two-night stay at the 
Embassy Suites Hotel in La Jolla,

The Palestinians have been trampled on 
since the First World War. Now the 
Palestz'nian Liberation Organization needs to 
find the right time to declare independence, 

By NIlou Mostofi 
senior Staff Writer 

On May 4 the five-year interim peri-od of the peace accord between Israel and Palestine expired. Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yasser Arafat has claimed that at this time. 
he would declare an independent Palestinian state. 
The Israeli government under Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu strictly forbade Arafat 's claims 
and has tried everything in his power to hinder 
Palestinian overeignty. 

The western world, especially the United States, 
urged Arafat to reconsider. The PLO did postpone 
an actual declaration of independence until after 
May 17 when the results of the Israeli prime min-
ister elections become apparent. Yet, a delay of the 
declaration of statehood has not curbed hostilities 
in this turbulent area, as the long and hard struggle 
over land and dominion rages on. 

This conflict has existed since time immortal 
wi th both cultures declaring IsraellPalestine their 
home. As with the ethnic conflict over land in 
Yugoslavia. Muslims and Jews have fought over 
thi territory for centuries. What is today known as 
Israel was once called Palestine, just a name 
change really, but one that carries with it an aura of 
nationalism and sense of belonging. 

During World War I, when the western powers 
wcre consolidating their overseas holdings, the 
Ouoman Empire had already established an exten-
sive Arab nation in this area. A significant Jewish 
population li ved in relative harmony under thi state. 

Of course Jews were given a lower social rank 
than Muslims, but as Islamic law dictates, they 
were sti ll allowed to practice their faith and contin-
ue their traditional customs. Under this system, the 
only regulation enforced on Jews was a religious 
tax to the Islamic state. In comparison to the treat-
ment of Jews around the wqrld and throughout 
time, their lives were peaceful . 

As World War I blazed on, British involvement 
in this area increased. A Muslim Palestinian-British 
coalition was created, as both sides needed the oth-
ers' support. The Palestinians wanted an indepen-

dent state. Although the British made an 

agreement with the Muslims, they also made an 
agreement with the Zionists (Jewish nationalists), 
who also wanted an independent state. 

The British justified their treachery to the Arab 
Muslims on the grounds that these agreements 
were pragmatic deals to ensure Allied victory. 

When the British gained a mandate over the region, 
Jews consisted of approximately 10 percent of the 
population. The numbers increased with British con-
cession of Jewish immigration (which accelerated in 
staggering amounts around the Second World War). 

When the British withdrew, the Zionists pro-
claimed Israel as an independent Jewish state in 
1948. Obviously, this outcome was not accepted by 
the Palestinians and thus the war continues. 

Presently, Israel is divided into two sections: 
Israel (Jews) and the West Bank (Muslims). The 
Gaza Strip is the place where most of tlte hostilities 
have occurred because it contains a huge Muslim 
population, yet it is under Israeli occupation. Under 
the peace accord, which expired on May 4, the 
West Bank was allotted to the Palestinians. yet 
technically, is still part of Israel. 

Recently. "Jewish settlers have established a 
new enclave in the West Bank, despite U.S. protests 
that Israel's recent drive to expand its presence in 
the territory damages the peace process with the 
Palestinians," according to an April 24 Associated 
Press news bulletin. Yasser Arafat and the PLO are 
proposing to completely separate the West Bank 
from Israel and establish an independent state. Yet 
the initial date of separation, May 4, is in question. 

"Arafat has traversed the globe in recent weeks 
secl<ing a trade-off for postponing statehood: a 
pledge from the intemati'onal community to recog-
nize Palestinian statehood after the extension," 
announced on April 27 by the Associated Press. He 
has acquired the backing of I,.ibyan leader Muammar 
Gaddafi , Jordan's King Abdullah, Egypt. Russia, 
China and he "has visited Japan, India, Pakistan, 
Indonesia, Yemen, South Africa and Turkey to learn 
whether they would support him if he unilaterally 
declared an independent Palestinian state," according 
an April 15 Associated Press update. 

The reason for postponing the declaration of 
statehood is the May 17 Israeli elections. "A 

unilateral move would likely help Israel 's 
nani-iine prime minister, Netanyahu, 
win re-election," announced by Reuters. 
The relationship between Netanyahu 
and Arafat has always been an 

extremely tense one. 
On Israel radio on May 17, 

Netanyahu repeated that he would 
never permit creation of a 

Palestinian state. According

Toto, I don't think we're at 
school anymore. 

The powers that be. in their infi-
nite wisdom, have decided to 
place a hotel and conference 
center on university property. 
The number of students on the 
committee that made this deci-
sion: zero. 

The unfortunate fact that stu· 
dents were left completely out of 
the decision-making process does-
n't mean that we can' t have an 
opinion. So why aren't we paying 
attention? A Monday meeting to 
discuss the project had a whole 
bunch of administrators, a few busi-
nessmen and a student. We all owe 
a big "!hank you" to Ryan Olsen for 
being the sole voice of the entire 
student population in this matter. 

It 's great that Olsen showed up 
to the meeting, but there are still 
several problems with this picture. 
First. one person can hardly repre-
sent the views of over 19,000 stu-
dents. Second, there were no stu-
dents appointed to the committee. 
We have absolutely no official say 
in th is matter. 

Universi ty officials make all 
kinds of decisions on a daily basis 
that don ' t involve student input. So 
why should we care about this one? 

The director of UCSD real 
estate development claims that the 

ideal hotel/conference center will 
benefit the entire UCSD communi-
ty. This is a pretty grand claim, 
especially considering the lack of 
student input. I don't think that a 
group of administrators and busi-
nes men can accurately judge what 
will benefit the students of UCSD. 

A hotel on campus may not ben-

elit us at all , in facl. ThankfUlly, 
we' re not paying for it , since the 
hotel builders will lease the land 
and then build on it, but the deci-
sion still affects us. That land could 
have been used for any number of 
things: housing, parking, etc. The 
decision to build a hotel may help 
UCSD financially, but it does not 
necessarily make UCSD any better 
for students. 

While I .realize that UCSD is a 
research universit y, I am not a 
research scientist. I pay the UC 
Regents $1400 per quarter in 
exchange for an undergraduate 
education. Therefore, I have a 
right, as do the rest of the students, 
to demand that UCSD meets my 
needs as a-student before it focuses 
on its business endeavors. The 
administration needs to consider its 
student population as the focus of 
the university instead of as a source 
of income. 

This is not to say that the hotel 
will not have any benefits to tu-

dents whatsoever. It may. However, 
we need to realize that all of the 
decisions surrounding i! are being 
made by people that are not stu-
dents, and therefore by people who 
don' t know how students feel about 
the endeavor. They may not even 
care how students feel about it. 
Unfortunately, it will affect us in 

some way, whether or not we 
have any input. Are we willing 
to si t back and take what comes? 

The decision to build the 
hotel has been made. Still unde-
cided is the destination of the 

income from the hotel. This, in the-
ory. is what will benefit the student 
body. This is where we need to 
assert our right to be heard. Without 
any input from students, the money 
will most likely go in directions 
consistent with the priorities of the 
administration. These are probably 
not the same priorities that the stu-
dents have. 

My point is this: The university 
is able to make decisions totally 
independent of the student popula-
tion not because they' re more pow-
erful than us, but because we don't 
care. We' ve shown a total di inter-
est in the administration of the 
school that we help support. 

If we want UCSD to be a 
school, instead of a large enter-
prise, we need to form opinions and 
assert our right to voice them. 
Don ' t just assume that someone 
else is going to handle it - you 
might not like what you get.

to the Associated Press, he 
claimed that , "He [Arafat] knows 
that as long as I'm prime minister 
of Israel, such a state will not be 
established." Therefore, it would 
be in Arafat's best interests to wait 
and see how the elections tum out. 

On May 10, the Netanyahu gov-
ernment dealt another blow below 
the belt as Public Security Minister 
Avigdor Kahalani issued an order 
enforcing a 24 hour closure of PLO 
office headquarters at Orient House 
in Arab East Jerusalem, or Israel 
would shut it down for them. 

The threat has left many 
angered by the presumptuousness 
of Netanyahu in his, as it S('.ems. 
final hours. (At th is point, 
Netanxahu trails Labor Party can-
didate and moderate, Ehud Barak). 

As it is located in East 
Jerusalem, the Orient House is 
the focal point of Palestinian 
political activity in Jerusalem and 
closing it down would entail dis-
location of Palestini an power 
over the region, which they want 
as the capital of the future state. 

The !inal decision on a state-
hood declaration, however, is up 
to the 124-member Palestinian 
Central Council. which is com-
posed primarily of PLO loyalists. 

According to Arafat, "We are 
going through a very delicate peri-
od in the history of our people, a 
period during which we cannot 
afford making any mistakes." 

One mistake would definitely 

Pale tinians, like the rest of the 
Middle East and the world for that 
matter, have endured a history of 
political subjugation and econom-
ic ~ubordination at the hands of 
Europe and the United States. 

U.S. invo lvement has onl y 
perpetuated the problem. The 
United States has always stuck its 
nose where it does not belong - in 
the guise of "humanitarianism" -
and enforced "peace treaties" that 
do not pertain to the situation. 

At this moment, the balance of 
power in Israel is uneven. 
Palestinians have been given the 
run around. 

Over the past three decades, the 
Israeli military and air force, thanks 
to former President Reagan, have 
become one of the most powerful in 
the world. Palestinians, on the other 
hand. fight with sticks and stones. 

Whether the PLO decides to 
declare an independent state after 
the elections is yet to be seen. 

S.ti II , one thing that is for cer-
tain, in an era where boundaries, 
lines, territory and states seem to 
be devastatingly important 10

same right to possess and fi ght for 
thei r own piece of earth, as due 
other "ethnic" groups.

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROTECTS INTERESTS 
COMMENTARY: 
Union representation 
election will help TA 
positions in UC ystem 
By Jenny Hyatt 
SpeCIal to the Guardian 

I write to encourage all teaching 
assistants to join me in voting for 
the A,sociation of Students 
Employees in this week's union 
representation election. 

Two-thirds of the 10.000 
Academic Student Employees 
(ASEs) at the University of 
California (UC) have signed union 
cards. We have chosen collective 
bargaining because it otTers a clear 
improvement over the C's current 
'ystem of "input." in which uni ver-
si ty administrators can uni laterally 
determine our working conditions. 

Collective bargaining, on the 
other hand. is a fair and etTccti ve 
process in which we will elect our 
bargaining representatives. dmft our 
own proposals, negotiatc with the 
UC and ratify a hinding contract. 

Last December. after 15 year ' of 

stalli ng during which the UC wast-
ed millions of public dollars trying 
to liti gate away the democratic 
choice for union representation, the 
California Public Employment 
Relations Board (PERB) affirmed 
thutteaching assistants, readers and 
tutors are employees with the right 
to select collecti ve bargaining. 

In a union representation election 
at UC Berkeley during late April. 
ASEs voted 833 to 293 in favor of 
collecti ve bargaining. In an election 
at the beginning of March. ASEs at 
UCLA voted for collective bargain-
ing 718 to 269. 

Following thi . election, UC 
President Richard Atkinson pledged 
to bargain in good faith with our 
chosen representatives, while PERB 
has continued to set elections at the 
other UC campuse~ for this spring. 

This Wed nesday and Thursday, 
we will have the hi storic opportuni-
ty to choose collect ive bargaining 
rights by voting for ASEIUAW in a 
PERB-run , union representation 
election. 

Collective bargaining is a 
process that works well for 50.000 

Lecture Meetings: 41 

Hours per Subject: 

TAs at nearly 20 
campuses from 
Oregon to 
Massachusetts to 
florida have also 
chosen collective 
bargaining as their 
preferred method 
for ensuring a fair, 
effective say In 
determining their 
working conditions. 
UC employees, including lecturers, 
librarians, researchers, health care 
professionals. nurses, tec hnical 
employees, campus police, clerical 
and construction workers. TAs at 
nearly 20 campuses from Oregon to 
Massachusetts to Florida have also 
chosen collective bargaining as their 
preferred method for ensuring a fair, 
crfective say in determining their 
working conditions. And, as PERB 
stated in its ruling, collecti ve bar-

gaining for TAs "will not on ly help 
develop a more harmonious and 
cooperative labor management rela-
tionship, but it will aflinnatively 
encourage excellence within the 
uni versity." 

There are many concrete rea-
sons for wanting to gain collective 
bargaining rights. During a period 
of "interim recognition" at UC 
Berkeley, the union won Pllrtial fee 
remissions and paid health care ) 
for TAs working at least 25 percent 
of the time. 

With union representation, ASEs 
will negotiate with the administra-
tion over employment issues while 
maintaining individual relationships 
with faculty. In fact , mo t negotiable 
employment issues such as wages. 
health care, grievance procedures 
and fee remission are set at campus 
and system-wide levels, not by the 
individual departments or faculty. 

Our unionized counterparts at the 
University of Michigan, Graduate 
Employees Organization/AFT Local 
3550, have negotiated a contract that 
gives TAs the same paid health and 
dental care plan as the faculty, paid

Without collective bargaining. 
the university can change our 
working conditions without con-
sulting us and, consequently. they 
regularly do so. For example, the 
UC recently reduced our annual 
pay increases by taking away the 
decades-old practice of giving TAs 
the same innation-based pay 
adjustments that faculty receive. 

We can vote to make collective 
bargaining a reality at UCSD. The

Beebee said that the competi-
tion inspired the clubs and organi-
zations to be more creative this 
year when designing their booths. 

"In general, I was really happy 
with the response from the campus, 
which was packed with students, 
especially for the performances," 
Beebee said. "The clubs did a good 
job with their designs and themes 
- they improved their booths this 
year. which added to the festival." 

In addition to the booths and 
performances, there were inflatable 
rides and games such as a 
Moonbounce, a boxing ring. slides 
and an obstacle course. These 
activities were also featured at the 
evening concert. 

Merchandise with the Sun God 
logo was also sold throughout the 
day. This year, in addition to pint 
glasses and shot glasses, three dif-
ferent T-shirt logos were featured 

CompCity and the UCSD Alumni 
Association. 

The festival also had musical 
entertainment. Freakdaddy. a reg-
gae/funklhip-hop/alternati ve band 
that is currently touring with Save 
Ferris. headlined the event. The 
Tri-Tones. a UCSD-based a cap-
pella group sang the national 
anthem and a Red Hot Chili 
Peppers song. Brazilian funk band 
GenteFina also played later in the 
day. 

she deserves the credit for finding 
the coaches." 

Aside from her determination to 
create a top-notch athletic program 
at UCSD, Sweet has also spent 
much of her career working to 
ensure the improvement of colle-
giate athletics in general. In 
January 1991. Sweet was elecled to 
a two-year term as president of the 
NCAA. In addition, Sweet has 
served on the Boards of Directors 
for the National Association of 
College Directors of Athletics and 
National Association of Collegiate 
Women Athletic Directors. 

Sweet's experience as a chair 
person and board member of vary-
ing athletics institutions has 
allowed her to formulate the kind 
of program UCSD athletics has 
become, and last year marked the 
paramount result of her work: The 
Sears Director's Cup. 

Given to each of the best com-

The UCSD Gwardian 

in women's tank tops. ringer tee's 
and the traditional T-shirt. 

The Sun God festival continued 
through Saturday, as the traditional 
intramural sports were added to 
this year's program. 

"So mallY people see Sun God 
as just a one-day event, and so 
many people participate in the 
Saturday events," Beebee said. "So 
there was no reason why the tWo 
events should not be promoted 
together." 

The Intramural Festival includ-
ed Outdoor Basketball. Co-cd 
Floor Hockey, Co-ed SC'ccer and 
Innertube Waterpolo. The tourna-
ment featured single-elimination 
playoffs. 

Beebee said he was extremely 
pleased with this year's event and 
he hopes that the Festivals 
Commitlee will continue to expand 
the Sun God Festival tradition. 

Freakdaddy vocalist Alan 
Meade said he donated his time to 
the event because he supported the 
idea of students taking part in char-
itable causes. 

'ihe reason that we're doing 
this is because, I think I speak for 
all the band members. it's a good 
causet " Meade said. "I'd want 
someone to donate if my child was 
terminally ill so a dream could 
come true for him or her. It's a 
good cause." 

bined athletic programs in NCAA 
Division l, II and m, as well as the 
top program in NAIA, the 
Director's Cup is the most presti-
gious award an athletic department 
can receive. As the result of an 
immensely successful year of athlet-
ics, where both the women's volley-
ball and soccer teams garnered 
national titles and men's swimming 
and diving team finished second in 
the nation, the Tritons were awarded 
the Sears Director's Cup title last 
October during UCSD's recently 
established Homecoming festivities. 

Sweet's athletic accolades did not

CONTROL: Energy 
Secretary said contracts 
will be up for bidding 
By Daniel Hernandez 
The Daily Californian 

(U-WIRE) BERKELEY. Calif. 
- The University of California is 
in no danger of losing its contract 
to operate three federal government 
laboratories, despite recent com-
ments by the U.S. energy secretary 
to suggest the contrary, UC ofli-
cials said Thursday. 

Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson said during a news con-
ference in Washington, D.C., on 
Tuesday that the contracts with the 
three UC-operated labs 
Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence 
LivernlOre and Los Alamos in New 
Mexico - may he placed on a 
competitive bid after they expire. 
Each lab has been UC-operatcd 
since its construction. 

the lahs, Lawren.:e Livermore and 
Los Alamos. 

Ri ck Malaspina, a UC 
spokesperson for all UC labs, said 
Thursday that Richardson 's com-
ments in regard to the contracts 
were taken out of context, and that 
UC is not expecting to lose control 
of their labs anytime soon. 

"It really was misunderstood, 
the implication being that the 
[Department of Energy] is going to 
compete these contracts and do it 
now - thaI's not how the process 
works," he said. 

Malaspina added that the energy 
department would not even contest 
the contracl1i unless there was a 
major chance that the labs' classi -
lied information is in danger - a 
notion that he said is not the case at 
Livermore or Los Alamos. 

I ~------------------------~ :~ _______ c~o~&~a~ _________ _ 
The remarks were immediately 

placed under scrutiny by major 
media organizations, especially in 
wake of alleged security breaches 
and spying accusations at two of 

''The [energy department! has 
made no decision on whether to 
expend or renew the contracts 
unless there's a compelling reason 
to the contrary - the national 
interest you might say - ~he 
government has found that r .. an-
agement by UC is in the national 
interest." he said.

National attention recently sur-
rounded the UC-operated nuclear 
labs at Livermore. Calif., and Los 
Alamo, N.M. when it was alleged 
earlier this year that dassified 
nuclear information was leaked to 
China. 

Despite the ensuing invest igation 
of Livenrnore's security measures, 
Malaspina said that Richardson's 
announcement of plans for tighter 
security should be allributed to the 
element of coincidence. 

"The university is and always 
has been strongly commilled to 
maintaining security at the top labs 
and fully supports the sl:cretary's 
new [plans for increased security 
measures] ." 

In addition. Malaspina admitted 
that lab security is an increasingly 
important issue, but only because · 
the computerized information that 
they regularly use are so new to the 
labs' operations. 

"The labs need to do a better job 
in certain areas, especially in com-
puter security - and that's because 
it 's a new area," he said. ''They ' ve 
done things to (help computer 
security) and we support that."

• (Star Wars: Episode One - The Phantom Menace I 
is coming to theaters this Wednesday and the hysteria for the saga is back with force 

Arena 
Page 12 

" tar Wars" is more than a cience fiction Ii 1m. 
It 's a cultural phenomenon . It ' modern-day 

mythology. It 's a fairy tale for the 20th century, and 
it 's damn hard to get tickets for. 

When "Star Wars: Epi ode One - The Phantom 
Menace" is released in theaters this Wednesday, audi-
ences will have their first opportunity to see a new 
chapter in the saga in nearly 16 years, since "Return 
of the Jedi" was released on May 25, 1983. 

With fans' enthusiasm rapidly increasing, the likelihood of 
seeing the film during its opening weekend i ' diminishing 
rapidly. 

So far. the hype has been overwhelming. People have quit 
their jobs so they can wait weeks in line in order to be one of 
the privileged few to see "The Phantom Menace" on the first 
day of its release. Theaters faced large masses of people wait- . 
ing in line just to buy the tickets when advanced sales started 
May 12. one full week before the fir t showing. And there has-
n't been a shortage of exci tement for movie- related parapher-
nali a ei ther. 

People lined up outside toy store a few weeks ago to be the 
first on their block . to own a glowi ng, double-bladed light 
saber. Everything from action figures to Pel. dispensers to 
skateboards (complete wi th knee pads) are avai lable for fans to 
purchase. 

So will the hype be worth it? If you ask any movie critic or 
even creator George Lucas himself, they will say the fans are 
expecting too much . The critics have said that it is indeed going 
to be a good movie. but not thllt good. 

However. any true "Star Wars" fan willtcll you that the end-
less wai ting in line, the growing anticipation and the as-of-yet 
unresolved excitement is most definitely. positi vely, undoubt-
edly wonh it. 

After all, thi s isn't just any movie. 
This ... is "Star Wars."

kayak and spend endless sunshine-
filled hours spla hing around in the 
surf. (Incidentally, you can also 
rent a kayak for bupkus at Outback 
Adventures on campus. but you ' lI 
need to have your own mode of 
transportation). For extra fun. you 
can paddle a half mile down the 
coast and explore the beautiful 
caves and kelp beds. The view 
includes a wide variety of marine 
life. such as the Garibaldi (big. 
orange fish). pelicans (big. dorky-
looking birds) and the elusive and 

after the Guardian Features section 
did a special review and I have to 
say thi s place is awesome if you 
like good dessert and old-time 
movies with Cary Grant. The Gar-
den Cabaret is located at 4040 
Goldfinch Street in Hillcrest (295-
4221). 

Do the "night on the town." 
OK. so maybe it's not New York. 
but downtown San Diego is aClual -
Iy a pretty happening place if you 
gellhere before midnighl! Save up 
your allowance for a week. 

The beautiful thing aboul the 
Sun God Festival at night is that 
you can get separated from your 
friends. wander around lost for 
hours. and wind up literally bump-
ing into everyone you ever mel at 
UCSD_ 

Not that I would kn0w _ .. I spent 
Friday night studying furiously for 
my next round of comm midlerms! 
(Mom? Dad? Comm professors? 
Are you reading this?) Since last 
week's column - in which I 
extolled the benefits of extracurric-
ular activitie ' - I feel I have 
unjustly been labeled a "slacker." I 
am not a TRUE slacker. True slack-

To all the indignant comm professors who decided 
to compensate for my remarks by paSSing out 

-supplementary lists of homework aSSignments -
please stop the insanity before my peers actually 

follow through with their death threats, 

. ers skip class so they can sit home 
and watch re-runs of MacGyver; I 
cut class so I can go to work and 
therefore earn enough money to 
pay for my numerous comm text-
books. 

This leads me to my second 
point. Being a comm major myself. 
I know that we are a particularly 
sensitive breed and some of us 
don't respond well to a little teas-
ing. To sct the record straight. I 
never intended to imply that being 
a comm major - or any other 
major, for that matter - is easy_ I 
simply meant the~ are some of us 
who are so intelligent that we can 
get A's with little or no elTon. I. on 

OK. I' ll be honest .. _ I didn ' t 
really spend Friday night studying 
because even a grouchy. old hermit 
like myself couldn't very well miss 
the social event of the season_ The 
Sun God Festival comes once a 
year but fun-loving UCSD students 
need not spend the next 360-some-
thing days in the Land of Boredom

San Diego. Summer is quickly 
approaching, so here's a list of 
things to do to help keep you in that 
festive spirit. 

Go kayaking_ This is the great-

tunning La Jolla Beach Guard. 
Bring your snorkeling gear and a 
life vest (the law requires you keep 
one on board) and don ' t f orgel a 
helmet if you plan on venturing 
close to the rocks_ There's only one 
downside - watch out for S-H-A-
R-K-S . I've seen them and they are 
actually very small (as opposed to 
the Jaws variety) but I'm not real-
ly wild about the idea of mingling 
with ANY meat-eating creatures 
that swim faster than I do. 

Go to the Garden Cabaret. What 
could be more relaxing than a 
balmy evening at an outdoor 
cafe/movie theater. surrounded by 
foliage, a waterfall and 20.000 
twinkly lights? It's paradise_ I dis-
covered this place last summer 

because you' re going to need it .. _ 
a really well-rounded night will be 
expensive_ The clubs are nice and 
loud. the restaurants are way better 
than cafeteria food. the stores are 
quirky and the people are actually 
nice_ I really dig downtown San 
Diego. even if it doesn't have the 
metropolitan leel of some of the 
bigger cities. In fact. that's proba-
bly the reason why I like it! 

Cross the border! I know you've 
done the TJ thing, but did you 
know there is a big, beautiful coun-
try down there past the neon? Ense-
nada is just a day trip away and you 
get to see some really nice, 
unblemished coastline_ It looks like 
San Diego probably used to look 
before someone built a bunch of 

® 

big. fat . ugly mansions right on the 
beach. Mexico is a great place and 
a fascinaling cultural experience. 
bUI jusl remember not 10 aCI like a 
jerky louri st. Be respectful and 
understand Ihal you are venturing 
inlO a foreign country where Amer-
ican rules and laws no longer apply. 
lI 's valuable if you or the people 
Iraveling with you speak fluent 
Spanish. 

Go park on Mt. Soledad. I gel 
teased a 101 by my friends because 
I'm so obsessed with romance, but 
whal fun is summertime without a 
little Iling? Find a "kissing buddy." 
Park Ihe car. Brielly admire the 
view. Proceed. (Nole: do NOT 
leave CD player on to set Ihe 
.. mood ..... I promise you the mood 
will be wrecked when you run 
down your baltery and have 10 
interrupi the next car over 10 get a 
jump start !) 

Go to the playground in the 
middle of the night. OK, so maybe 
Ihis suggestion mighl be the teensi-
est bil illegal (if you get caught) bUI 
hanging oul on Ihe swing sel in Ihe 
cool. night air is a nice relief from 
your hot. sluffy apartment. 

Call in sick 10 work . You 
shouldn'l do Ihi on a regular basis 
or you' lI get your sorry self fired, 
but take a day off from your sum-
mer job, pack a picnic lunch and 
drive somewhere. Anywhere: 
Don:t plan it, just go. Maybe it's a 
"slacker" thing to do. but what the 
heck .. . summer is short!

The Phantom Menace' comes to San Diego 
Camping Tip s 

If you' re serious about securing 
a decent seat for an opening-day 
showing of "Star Wars," you're 
going to need to do some camping 
out in front of the theater. Here's a 
number of ways to make your stay 
a lot more comfortable, and enjoy-
able. 
CII*t 

If you' re spending the night, on 
concrete, you'd better be sure to 
bring lots of padding. Sleeping 
bags, pillows, comforters. and even 
mattresses can ease the ache on 
your weary bones. Coordinate with 
others in your group to determine 
who has the best equipment. 
EMII1ainment 

To sustain yourself - and those 
you're with - be sure to bring a 
number of games along. Board 
games, hand-held computer games 

and classic card &ames are excel-
lent ways to pass the weary hours 
in line. Trivial Pursuil: Slar Wars 
Edition is an excellent option. 
Food 

Sure you can run across the 
st reet to any Taco Bell, Pizza Hut 
or KFC and pick up some "Star 
Wars"-endorsed fast food, but why 
leave the line? Come prepared with 
barbecues, charcoal and a wide 
array of grillable grub to cook and 
serve. 

Documentation 
Who can stand to spend 48 

hours in one place and not docu-
ment the experience? Film, video, 
and digital cameras provide an 
excellent means to record and 
remember where you were and 
who you were with when "Star 
Wars" returned to theatl!rs in 1999. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Dummies' Guide 
II 's been a long time since "Star 

Wars" fever has been in style. So 
for all those who may have forgot-
ten, seen only some of the movies 
or (shudder) never seen "Star 
Wars," here is a brief recounting of 
the original trilogy. However, to 
fully appreciate the new film, 
audiences should definitely rent 
and watch the original films. 
CharadIrs 

The original trilogy focuses on 
an ensemble of characters. The 
most central of these characters are 
Luke Skywalker, a young farmer 
who becomes the galaxy's last Jedi 
knight, and Danh Vader, the evil 
lord of the Empire and the Dark 
Side of the Force. 

In the course of the story, the 
truth about the destinies of both 
Luke Skywalker and his father are 
revealed. Luke and Vader collide in 
a battle between good and evil and 
in the end, well, rent the movies. 

Other central characters include: 
Han Solo, a smuggler/mercenary 
who becomes a freedom fighter; 
Chewbacca, Solo's faithful Wook-
ie; Princess Leia, a central figure of 
the rebellion against the empire; 

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 1999 

R2-D2 and C3PO, a pair of droids; 
Yoda, an ancient Jedi master who 
trains Luke in the ways of the 
Force; Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi, an 
old Jedi master who helps the group 
escape the clutches of the Death 
Star; Lando Calrissian, an ex-
smuggler who joins the rebellion. 

There are many more charac-
ters, far too many to list here. 
locations 

All of the drama unfolds on a 
variety of planets and space sta-
tions. Some of the key locations of 
the "Star Wars" series are: 
Tatooine, a barren desert-planet 
and Luke Skywalker's home; the 
Death Star, a space station the size 
of a small moon which is the 
Empire's most destructive techno-
logical achievement; Yavin, the 
first secret hiding place of the 
Rebel Alliance; Hath, a planet of 
ice and snow and the Rebel's sec-
ond second secret base; Dagobah, 
a swamp-world where the Jedi 
master Yoda trained Luke Sky-
walker; Bespin, a gas giant which 
is orbited by a floating city where 
Luke and Vader first duel; Endor, a 
lacge forest-moon where (on the

you ' re trying to sell something, 
wait until then. People will be 1110re 
flexible and willing to spend during 
Gemini . The mnon is in Gemini on 
Monday, going into Cancer. where 
it stays through Tuesday. Those 
shou ld be good days for doing 
business. Cancer loves to wheel 
and deal. On Wedne day, the 11100n 
goes into Leo and stays through 
Friday. The Leo-Taurus combina-
tion is rigid - a good time for 
making deci sions. but not good for 
introducing new ideas. Over the

fer, was only 1I two-year pl ayer for 
the Tritons but hi impact was felt 
in the short time he played. His 
slash ing, penetrating dri bbling 
always seemed to free up leam-
mates for the open three. L ast sea-
son, Garratt averaged 14.2 points a 
game. second-most on the team 
whi le averaging 28.3 minutes a 
game. more than any other Triton. 

Team captain L ibby is a fifth-
year senior who helped lead the 
Tri ton attack from the point. A 
ski lled passer, Libby's moves and 
outstanding dishes always drew 
"oohs" and "ahhs" from the Triton 
faithful. Libby fin ished his career 
in third placr all time on the career 
as ist l ist at UCSD with 334 and 

15th all time in scoring with 823 
points despite missing all but three 
games of 1996-97 season with a 
tornACL. 

" I have not seen a more talented 
point guard in Divi sion III leve!," 
Lanthier stated. 

Team Captain Wall. 6'6" for-
ward four-year starter. was one of 
the best players UCSD has ever 
seen. The team's main offensive 
weapon, Wall lead the Tritons on 
both ends of the floor. Averaging 
over 20 points a game last season, 
Wall 's 1.700 career points rank him 
th ird in UCSD's record book. A 
rebounding machine as well. Wall's 
628 boards rank him lifth all-time 
in UCSD history. To top it off, Wall 
owns the Triton record for most 
three pointers made in a career with 
252 .. 

Incredibly before this season, 
Lanthier' Triton team had never 
had more than one senior who con-
tributed heavily. Last sea on, all six 
did. It 's no wonder the Tritons did 
as well as they did and there is no 
doubt it was a senior season to 
remember for these six senior lead-
ers. It is obvious that their leader-
ship will be mi ssed.

Men's Polo Graduates Seven Studly Seniors 
GOODBYE: Head Coach Denny Harper's squad will be short a handful of hard workers and tea~ leaders next fall 
By Sarah Hollne 
Staff Writer 

Parting is such sweet sorrow. 
Especially when you have to say 
goodbye to seven great men 's 
water polo players. 

Steve Burkhalter. Doug Cole, 
Andrew Lindstrom, John Marlett. 
Ryan Samuel ian, Brian Traverso 
and Joe Welsh will all graduate in 
June, and leave a tearful Head 
Coach Denny Harper waving 
goodbye. 

Together these seniors led the 
team, not always in playing time 
or goals made. but by their atti -
tudes and maturity. 

Cole. originally from Haleiwa, 
Hawaii, made a signilicant contri-
bution during his four years on the 
team. 

Steve 
BurtdwJter: 
Aside from 
receiving 
praise for his 
teamwork, 
Burkhalter 
also scored 9 . 
goals and 6 
assIsts. 

"He will probably go down in 
UCSD history as the least experi -
enced player that improved most 
rapidly," Harper said. "He had a 
hunger for getting beuer, and he 
really improved every single 
year." 

Cole started playing 
only during 
his junior year 
in high 
school, but he 
started on varsity as a fresh-
man when he came to UCSD. 
and that was just the beginning. 
Cole improved every season. and, 
despite severe shoulder problems 
la t fall, he was the team's highest 
scorer, and also had the most 
playing lime. 

Welsh, the Tritons' goalie. is 

Dou ..... 
Cole: 
A power in 
the hole, 
Cole lead 
UCSD with 
56 goals and 
also dished 
out 21 
assists. 

another senior that will be sorely 
missed. 

"Joe is one of the most likable 
people," Harper said. " It was a 

good thing for the team, he 
brought camaraderie, which 

fed the rest of the guys." 
In five seasons as 

k ee per 
on the 
UCSD 
squ ad , 

Welsh turned into a 
very steady goalie for 

the Tritons. He made 178 saves en 
route to the Tritons' third-place 
finish at Nationals last fall. 

Traverso, another valuable 
senior, has been a source of 
strength for the team throughout 
his career at UCSD. 

Andrew 
UncI.trom: 
In 66 
quarters this 
season, 
Lindstrom 
racked up a 
pair of goals 
and 3 
assists. 

"lust thi s la t season, 
Traverso's improved play has 
turned him into quite a force for 
our team," Harper said . 

Others on the team, Lindstrom, 
Burkhalter, Samuelian and Marlett, 
all received praise from Harper. 
These players were all great lead-
ers, working hard to contribute to 
their team. The men gave their all 
at every practice and made the 
UCSD men 's water polo team so 
successful in the past four years. 

As a whole, these seniors really 
enjoyed each others' company and 
they had fun in the water. There are 
only a few athletes that can playa 
hard game and have a good time 
doing it, and these seven guys are 
definitely some of the best UCSD 
has had in its pools. 

A hard worker 
and leader 
for the 
Tritons, 
Marlett was

veteran , 
Welsh held

he had 178

Brian 
Traverso: 
This senior 
was another 
valuable 
force for 
UCSD. He 
added 14 
goals to the 
Triton cause 
last fall . 

Ryan

A strong all-
around asset 
for Coach

Sun God: A lesson 
in thermodynamics? 

Before I revel in the glory 
that was Sun God '99 I have a 
confession to make: I am what 
is ca lled scientifica ll y chal -
lenged. I have no knowledge of 
genetics and the onl y thing I 
know about thermodynamics is 
that beer gets cold faster in the 
freezer th an it does in the 
fridge. 

Although people like me arc 
subservient for mo t of t he year, 
there is one day that we break 
out of the mold and ignore aca-
demics and lead thi s school in 
mindless drunken activities. 
Friday was that day. Friday was 
Sun God. 

The Thursday before Sun 
God, I was like a child on 
Christmas Eve, I couldn 't fall 
a leep for the longest time. I 
said a lillie prayer. "God, even 
though I don't deserve it . will 
you please make tomorrow 
sunny and warm so as to accom-
modate the planned events: ' 

On SunGod morning. I woke 
up nice and late - there wa no 
way I was goi ng to class. Despi te 
my late start , I got off the blocks 
quick ly once I was awake. In 
fact I started a lillie too quickly, 
and worshiped the porcelain god 
long before the Sun God. 

But I wa ' determined not to 
let that ruin my day and my 
friends and I left my apartment 
at about noon. 

We took in the spectacle on 
library walk. including the 
three- ringed twirling menace 
that one person deemed the 
puke machine. A few people, 
including me. wanted to experi-
ence this apparatus but were 
persuaded not to by the memory 
of what had happened earlier in 
the day. 

By the time we made it to 
Muir Field, I was itching to get 
into the boxing ring and get out 
ome pent-up aggression. After 

a modest wait , my roommate 
and I squared orr in what wi II go 
down as one of the greatest 
innatable boxing mi smatches of 
all time. Hi s paltry frame was 
no match for the angst and fury 
that I laid upon him. I sent him 
sprawling to the mat. 
Triumphant and happy, 
dragged my ex hausted and ine-
briated body home for a refill. 
There was a concert to go to. 

The concert was awesome. I 
was amazed not only at the 
amount of people there, but also 
by the leve l of intoxication. 
UCSD was social for once. 

One of my friends described 
thi s year 's Sun God Festival as 
an li on a scale from one to 10. 
J would have to agree. Last 
Friday gave me a new found 
hope for our university. Thank 
you all for the memories.

PORTS 

Th Tritons added to their fantastic eason this 
we kend as they hosted the CeM Champion hips 
By Saul Sheridan 
Senior Staff Writer 

As weekends go. there was none 
bigger than this weekend for the 
UCS D track and field team. Thi ' 
weekend was the one reason 
why they have been working 
so hard for so long. It was 

who recorded a personal best time 
of I :54.5 1. Just eight hundredths of 
a second behind Garcia came Rory 
Clarke, coming in at I :54.59. The 
trio 's performance gave UCSD 

some much needed points 
late in the day that olidilied 
its hold on fourth place. 

Monday, May 17, 1999 

the California 
Collegiate Athletic 
Associatio n 
Championships, and 
UCSD was host. 

Al so havi ng a 
success ful day on 
Saturday was the 
men's 4x 100 relay 

Julius ChoY Guard,an 
C ...... p: Jame~ Nielsen leads the pack in the 1500-meter, Saturday. 

Last year, the Tritons 
fought hard and were able to come 
away wi th a third-place fini sh in 
both the men ' and women's com-
petition. But thi year. backed by a 
number of retuming athletes and a 
strong desire to win, the Tritons 
looked poised and ready to claim 
the title for themselves. But so 
were perennial track and field pow-
ers and CCAA newcomers UC 
Dav is. Chico State and San 
Francisco State. 

These new ly added squads 
tumed out to be the Tritons' tough-
est competitors over the course of 
the two-day event . and when the 
dust settled, the Triton men fin-
ished in fourth and the women 
grabbed fi fth place honors. 

The two-day event was filled 
with drama and excitement. 

One of the Tritons' most impres-
sive performances on Saturday was 
tumed in by the men 's 800-meter 
runners. Steve Smith led the charge 
with a national qualifying time of 
I :52.36, good enough for second 
overall. Coming in right behind 
him was teammate Damian Garcia, 

team. The squad of Erick 
Cheung, Andrew Gonzalez, 

Rodger O' Keefe and Dave 
Newquist set a new school record 
in the event with a time of 42.12 
econds. 

"They were magnificent." Head 
Coach Ted Van Arsdale aid. "We 
now have a sprint squad that can 
compete with any squad in the con-
ference ." 

Not to be forgotten was the 
championship performance of 
sophomore James Nielsen. Nielsen 
came away with first -place in the 
1,500-meter run with a time of 
3:52. 12. He later went on to place 
second in the 5.000-meter with a 
time of 14:40.9 1. Both of his times 
earned him provisional spots for 
nationals. 

"lames is a championship-qual-
ity runner," Van Arsdale said. "He 
has a sensational altitude about 
competi tion. He doesn ' t let things 
bother him." 

Earlier on Saturday morning, 
UCSD got orr to a blazing tart 
with the women's javelin throw. 
Freshman Lynn Brinkman threw a 
distance of 118 '02", just inches 

below her personal best, to place 
eighth for the Tritons. Coming in 
right behind her were her team-
mates Catherine Nolan and Amy 
Olin. olan recorded a personal 
best of 114'04" while Olin also 
threw a personal best with a di s-
tance of 111 '07". 

Also enjoying a good day on 
Saturday was junior Jessica 
Shugart . Shugart started her day 
with a lifth-place linish in the 100-
meter dash with a time of 12 sec-
onds. Less than an hour later, she 
went to place third in the 200-meter 
dash with a national qualifying 
time of 25.38 seconds. 

On Friday, freshman Tina 
Summers got the meet going for 
the Tritons with her national quali-
fying throw in the hammer event. 
Summers throw of 146'04" was 
good enough to eam her fourth-
place overall. Coming in just three 
inches short of Summers was 
Christi Norton, whose throw of 
146'01 " was good enough for fifth 
overall. The two performances put 
UCSD on the board early, giving

Six UCSD Careers Come to an End 
DONE: After a record-setting season, six men tum in their jerseys 
By Jake Gordon 
Sports Editor 

As the NBA playoffs finish up 
the first round, many Triton fans 
have been seen looking wistfully at 
their TV screens, dreaming about 
the past year's collegiate basket-
ball season. Last season was a 
dream season for head Coach 
Greg Lanthier 's 
troops except 
for one small 
thing: no post-season. 

Despite a 20-5 record 
including a superb 12-2 mark in 
Division 1lI, the overachieving 
UCSD squad was denied a berth in 
the playoffs by a naw in the quali-
fication process. Nevertheless, 

UCSD had an amazing run and the 
heart and soul of the team were the 
six Triton seniors. loel Foote, Nick 
Maroutsos, Ahmad Russ, Tyler 
Garrat, Adam Libby and Mike Wall 

fostered the on- and off-the-
court chemistry that made the 

team click. 
Foote, a 6'4" for-

war d , 
joined 
the team 
in 1997-

98 and has consis-
tently improVed during 

his whole career. A valuable com-
modity off the bench, he proved he 
could shoot from the outside, lead-
ing the team with 47.9 percent 

three-point percentage. 
Maroutsos, a four year player 

for the Tritons, was UCSD's sixth 
man most of last season and could 
always be counted on to fire away 
from the outside. Always a confi-
dent shooter, he hoisted a team-
leading 131 three-pointers and 
made 49 of them to lead the Bomb 
Squad. His 724 points rank him 
22nd on the all -time Triton scoring 
book. 

Russ, a 6'5" center, was a rook-
ie for the Tritons last year. His 
inexperience didn ' t show on the 
court, however, where he averaged 
5.7 points and 5.2 rebounds a game
