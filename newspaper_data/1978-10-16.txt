Smith ' Asks US Support as 150 Picket 
By DorodIy HOusaoa 

&&aff Wrtter 
Rhode.ian Prime Minister 

Smith, speakiq in San 
Saturday, called for 
State. support for the 

transitional 

ment of Rhodesia because it is 
"doini everything the free 
world has asked it to." 

Smith spoke under tight 
security before 200 editors and 
publishers attendini the United 
PTe8lfnternationaiconvention 

at the Hotel Del Coronado on 
Coronado Islanc;t While he 
spoke, a group 0 150 marched 
in front of the hotel protestini 
Smith's visit to the United 
States and chanted support for 
the Patriotic Front, the iuer-
rilla forces based in Mozam-
bique that have fought the 
Rhodesian government for six 
years. 

Smith said that if the United 
States had supported him after 
bis agreement to a plan two 
years ago initiated by then 
Secretary of State Henry 
Kissinger, the current bloody 
situation in Rhodesia could 
have been avoided. 

An interim government led 
by an Executive Council 
consisting of Smith and three 
blacks was set up in March of 
this year and is to be the stage 
before a black majority rule 
government. If support is given 
to this government, SmiU\ said, 
the Rhodesian problem could 
be transformed. 

Smith said democratic na-
tions have a "moral obligation 
to the innocent people being 
killed in Rhodesia by the 
Patriotic Front" and to "sup-
port the democratic ideals the 
government stands for." 

The UCSD Black Student 
Union (BSU) issued a state-
ment last Thursday which held 
that the "transitional govern-
ment proposal for gradual end 
of discrimination is a token 
attempt at majority rule ." The 
BSU said that Smith should not 
be here " or anywhere else 
gathering support for his 
proposal. " 

The Prime Minister repeated 
Saturday what he has been 
saying elsewhere in the United 
States since he arrived a little 
more that a week ago to "clear 
up misconceptions the Ameri-
can people, and especially the 
Administration , have about 
Rhodesia ." 

Smith was invited to tbe 

of 27 senators, with S.I . Haya-
kawa (R-Calif .) being the 
Senate sponsor. Carter has not 
met with Smith and has not 
termed his visit official. 
Accompanying Smith is Execu-
tive Council member Rev . 
Ndabaningi Sithole.

Mathias of Maryland, instruct-
ed the SchOOl tnat it has, "the 
obligation to exercise leader-
ship at all levels in the Ameri-
can medical and health com-

problems in medicine today -
skyrocketing prices, over-
s pecialization, overuse of 
unnecessary elective surgery 
- chariini that medical 
instructors have more in-

VA MOs Paid Illegally 
Six Accused, Surgery Chiefs Sacked 

By Eric Harpell 
Staff Writer 

At least six surgeons from the 
V A Hospital performed 35 
unauthorized operations at a 
Bakersfield hospital, and 225 
unauthorized operations at 
University Hospital, while they 
were receiving pay for time 
falsely reported at the VA 
facility in La Jolla . 

In a report obtained by the 
Los Angeles 'Times, a special 
ift'ftstigator for the V A found 
that two of the time cards 
belonging to the. surgeons in 
question were altered to show 
that they were on duty at the 
VA, when in fact the two 
physicians were perfonning 
operations elsewhere. One of 
the time cards was changed to 
show that the surgeon had been 
on duty for a full day at the V A 
hospital when he was not 
scheduled to be there. Records 
from University Hospital show 
that the surgeon was there on 
that day perfonning a Jive-hour 
operation. 

Dr. Marshall J. Orloff , 
chainnan of the UCSD surgery 
department, and Dr. Gerald W. 
Peskin, chief of surgery at the 
V A hospital, were both notified 
that they would no loqer hold 
their part-time positions at the 
VA Hospital by the end of July. 
The V A staff in Washington DC 
has not taken any final action, 
however, pending the appeal of 
the physiCians. 

Orloff and Peskin, in addition 
to other V A surieons, are 
officers in the Suriical Edu-
cations and Research Founda-
tions. The foundation is a non-
profit corporation based in 
Kern County, and is earning 
$96,000 a year contingent to a 
private contract with Kern 
Medical center. 

The VA sUfleonsoperating8t 

Kern were not being paid for 
work there, receiving only $125 
to cover travel and living 
expenses. Other money gained 
goes into the foundations 
"discretionary fund ," for lab 
.equipment and additi<fhal 
funding. 

John H. Moxley III, dean of 
the UCSD medical school, has 
written to the Kern County 
Board of Supervisors , in -
fonning them that their private 

contract is not recognized by 
the University. UCSD has a 
separate agreement with the 
Kern County Hospital , pro-
viding for the exchange of 
residents , but making no 
mention of providing faculty 
members to supervise them. 

The Times reported that 
Moxley said that the University 
disapproved of such faculty-
run private foundations and

Reg Fee Postpones 
Intern Budget Vote 

By John Hondros 
Associate News Edilor 

At their first meeting of the 
academic year Wednesday, the 
Registration Fee Committee 
postponed voting on a motion 
which would include $2400 more 
to the Reg Fee Internship 
Program. 

According to Intern Coor-
dinator Mary Anne Rogers, last 
year's budget request was for 
four interns and a budget 
analyst . Due to the over-
whelming response and quality 
of the applicants, Rogers 
suggested that the committee 
add $2400 more to the proiram 
and hire six interns. "We're 
very impressed with the group 
interviewed. We've narrowed it 
down to six outstanding can-
didates, trying to whittle down 
to four would not be rational ," 
said Rogers . 

The Reg Fee Internship 
Program was establl hed in 
1976 with the goal of supporting 
and assistini the committee 
and increasing student partici-
pation in the deci ion makinR 

process. according to Rogers. 
She believes having six people 
would give the committee some 
flexibility . 

Voting on the proposal was 
postponed until next week's 
meeting, as some members of 
the committee felt they hadn't 
had enough time to review it. 

Physical Education Super-
visor Howard Hunt presented a 
report on Intercollegiate 
Athletics Insurance at the 
meeting . Due to the new 
student health insurance 
policy, students participating 
in intercollegiate athletics are 
no longer covered for injuries 
incurred duriq athletic par-
tiCipation, Hunt said. 

Some committee members 
sultested that students pay 
tt:eir own insurance, but Hunt 
mentioned that it would cost 
.each 5tudent $2S per sport, 
which would be "too steep." 

In other business, the official 
name of the (.'ommittee was 
changed from the Advi ory 
Committee on Student Fee 
Programs to the Registration 
Fee Committee.

emnants of Fascism Clutter Spain 
By Lallrie nom .... 

T he dusk air. per-fumed with hu-midity and the aroma of candied nuts, is cut by the 
sound of laughter 

and the deep resonating voices 
of lottery vendors. 

It it about five o'clock on a 
Sunday afternoon and many 
Barceloneans, their spirits 
tifted by a leisurely lunch, are 

provokes their' mutual reac-
tions. The dembnstraturs 
normally begin their march at 
the sea-port end of ,. Las 
Ramblas," and the police wait 
above. As the demonstrators 
begin to march up, the police 
begin to march down, and if you 
happen to be walkiDi alol1l you 
are sandwiched somewhere in 
between. There is a tense 
moment as these two groups 
confront one another; an 

another Molotov cocktail. 
Who's throwing these bombs? 
Why? The small battle con-
tjnues and more police invade 
the scene. firing shots and 
throwing smoke bombs until 
Las Ramblas is enshrouded in a 
dense baze. But where are the

stop for a cup of coffee. 

"Las Ramblas" is the name 
of a tree-lined pedestrian 
walkway which cuts through 
the heart of Barcelona, It is 
kDawn to the. tourists for its 
very cosmopolitan atmosphere 
and unique booths that sell 
flowers, fish and birds. This 
colorful flfcade, however has 
grey undertones . 

Being the focal point of a 
large industrial city it stages 
gatherings for innumerable 
political and social causes. 
Most of these reunions are 
deemed illegal by the govern-
ment who has a right to censor 
any and all demonstrations. 
These groups state their cause 
and objectives in an organized 
march and by passing out hand 
bills. Sunday has become the 
day for most demonstrations. It 
is almost expected that be-
tween the hours of six and eight. 
a political mood will replace the 
festive one.

In a country where faeism

" los grises" (the grey men) ,

from behind doorways and 
sheltered side alleys, slowly 
filtering on to the street again, 
the danger seemingly gone. Yet 
a tension remains: the laughter 
and talking are more subdued,

On the surface, one might 
think the situation easy to 
deduce. After all, if the police

then the demonstrators are 
obviously left, as are their

ever, this easy conclusion has 
some flaws. For example there 
have been times when the 
demonstration was of a non-
political nature, as when the 
Gays had a march. During this 
march bombs were also thrown 
from the side streets - ob·

could be the left retaliating

The ambiguous nature of the

Letters 

Thomas 
Editor: 

The Guardian'S story on Dr. 
Thomas ' objection to the 
naming of Third College has 
succeeded in getting me to 
ignore my policy of ignoring the 
pGlitics of this university . The 
purpose of this letter is not to 
extend the squabble over the 
name of a college, which will 
not affect my ability to study at 
that college. Rather, the logic 
used by Dr. Thomas, and the 
process by which he was able to 
prevent permanent recognition 
of the name "Third College" 
were So strange, and so ir-
ritating, that I cannot remain 
quiet this time . 

Dr. Thomas' criticism of last 
year's mail-in election rings of 
sour grapes. His own informal 
poll of Black Third alumni is 
itself " suspect." Had he 
contacted fifty Filipino alumni, 
or Chicano, Oriental , White or 
Middle Eastern alumni. he 
probably would have had 
several other names suggested. 
In fact. there are at least a 
dozen ethnic groups repre-
sented at Third College, each 
with their own cultures and 
heroes. If Dr. Thomas does not 
consider the election conducted 
by the college to be democratic, 
what does he call his? 

Dr. Thomas' comment re-
garding substantial majorities 
in American society is one that 
makes me wonder about his 
criterion for making decisions 
in a group. The purpose of an 
election is to decide which 
choice from a selection is 
pleaSing or acceptable to the 
most people, since not everyone . 
will be in agreement. This 
happens to be eqU,ivalent to 
majority rule . Dr . Thomas 

before all these difficulties are 
ironed out. 

Darkness has not set in and 
the electric street lamps, their 
light filtered through a cloud of 
smoke, cast a hazy glow on 
"Las Ramblas." Tear gas 
fumes remain in the air and 
burning eyes are a reminder of 
the turmoil experienced a few 
hours before. 

Irritates 
appears to believe that unless 
the majority votes his way that 
the majority is wrong . Without 
being slanderous, one asPect of 
maturity is realizing that 
sometimes the rest of the world 
will nol think your way, and 
living with it. 

Another feature of Dr . 
Thomas' objection to the name 
"Third College" that is suspect 
is his reason for favoring the 
name" Douglass College. " 
Frederick Douglass is a hero to 
many Americans and non-
Americans because he lived, 
fought and died for what he 
believed. He is not solely a 
Black-American hero . The 
name .. Douglass College" 
would be acceptable to me, as 
would the names of several 
other historical figures, from 
several other ethnic back -
grounds . 

However , Dr . Thomas 
apparently has a particular 
group of people in mind with the 
name Douglass. He seems 
more concerned with attract-
ing a particular segment of the 
population to the college, when, 
according to the Third College 
Orientation Handbook, "The 
multi-ethnic commitment is 
demonstrated by its population 
and its continuous striving (or 
equality in social harmony." 
Obviously, Dr. Thomas has 
different ideas regarding the 
purpose of Third College. 

My last observation regards 
the fact that Provost Stewart's 
committee and Chancellor 
McElroy both concurred with 
Dr. Thomas. To that I say, 
nothing has surprised me about 
the administration of UCSD 
since my second quarter here .

Harold H. Saunders , the

about last month's Camp David 
Accords. 

Hussein 's questions touched

Sherman said Saunders may

include Jerusa lem and the

BOSTON (AP) - Dozens of 
demonstrators carrying anti-

chanting "Death to the Klan" 
attacked four klansmen Sun-

Hurling bricks and using 
their signs as clubs, the 
protesters assualted two un-

men identified by police as 
William Wilkinson, 36, the' 
imperial wizard of the Invisible 
Empire of the Knights of the Ku

Iraq Demands 
Higher Prices 

KUWAIT (AP) - Iraqi Oil 
Minister Tayeh Abdul Karim 
warned Sunday of a possible 
breakup of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Coun-
tries if the oil cartel fails to 
adop.t a "just and logical" price 
increase when it meets in 
December. 

He said the current $12.70 
price for a barrel of crude oil 
was equivalent to only $4 in real 
terms because of inflation and 
the declining value of the 
dollar. 

" To compensate for the loss 
in . real terms, " he said, "oil 
prices should be doubled. But 
we certainly will take into 
consideration the circum-
stances of industrialized and 
Third World nations so as to 
avoid perplexing the world 
economy." 

Karim said in an interview 
with the Kuwait daily Al-Seyas-
sah newspaper that Iraq "will 
reject any proposal for freezing 
oil prices or even for a symbolic 
hike at the Abu Dhabi meeting 
and will insist on a just and 
logical increase in 011 prices." 

A renewal of this year's oil-
price freeze, pushed through 
OPEC by Saudi Arabia and 
Iran, would be "tantamount to 
betrayal," Karim said. 

He said if OPEC fails to 
protect Iraq's Interests, his 
government will ask itself 
"what Is the justification for 
OPEC's existence and then will 
seek an alternative ol'lanlza-
lion. "

signs identifying them as being

Racism, had been marching 
around the plaza before the

by an anti-busing group called 
the South Boston Marshals. 

Hussein two weeks ago sa;d 
his price for joining the talks 
included full American partici-
pation and redefinition of the 
framework for negotiations 
over the future of the West 
Bank of the Jordan River and

Department spokesman, said

NEW YORK (AP) - Patricia 
Hearst says she wHl ' marry 
Bernard Shaw, a fomer San 
Francisco policeman who was 
her bodyguard, on Valentine's 
Day. 

In a copyright interview in 
Sunday's New York Post, Miss 
Hearst, 24, said her fiance is 
Htall , fair-haired and ' hand-
some ... He lifts weights, has a 
black belt in kara te and be 's fun 
to be with. My family really 
likes him." 

Miss Hearst said in t he 
interview that she became 
engaged to Shaw, 30, last Feb. 
14. 

Miss Hearst will be eligible 
for parole in July from her 7-
year sentence for robbing a 
bank while she lived with 
members of the Symbionese 
Liberation Army who had 
kidnapped her. 

She said the Justice Depart-
ment prosecuted her for the 
1975 robbery because " they 
were desperate to get public 
attention off the Nixon pardon 
and I was the most visible 
person at the time." 

Miss Hearst has asked Presi-
dent Carter for a pardon.

Drug Effects 
Altered by Food 

By Doul Campioa 
Sc:lneeEdl .... 

Not only is the combination of 
certain drugs with alcohol 
dallierous and unpredictable, 
but foods, too, can alter the 
effect of drugs on the human 
body, according to a study by 
the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) . 

The study, which dealt 
mainly with prescription and 
over-the-counter medications· 
rather than "recreational" 
drugs , was aimed at dis-
covering which foods act to 
either inhibit or accelerate the 
absorption of specific chemi-
cals into the bloodstream. In 
many cases, the altering of the 
absorption rate which was 
anticipated by the physician 
who prescribed the drug will 
not only delay the cure of a 
disease, but l1)ay also result in 
some side effects ranging in 
severity from simple nausea to 
death . 

Leafy lreen veeeta,bles su~h. 
as cebbage, lettuce and SPin-
ach, supply a great deal of 
vitamin K. This nutrient has the 
effect of naturally promotinl 
clotting of the blood - an 
undesirable trait -for a person 
taking anticoagulants . The 
vitamin would, to some degree, 
counteract the drug. However, 
a woman taking oral contra-
ceptives should intentionally 
include these vegetables in her 
diet as they are also a rich 
source of folic acid, a chemical 
often found to be deficient in 
women who are on the pill . 

In general , acidic fruits. 
acidic vegetables, and most 
sort drinks cause drugs taken 
orally to dissolve quicker in the 
stomach. However, drugs are 
often designed so tha~ they will 
not dissolve completely until 
they reach the intestine, where 
they can more easily enter the 
bloodstream. A Coke or an 
orange, then, could sorely limit 
the action of a medicine.

Primate Study Says 
Fights Help SpeCies 

SANTA BARBARA - Even monkey business serves a serious 
purpose, according to an anthropologist at the University of 
California at Santa Barba'ra who has studied free-ranging rhesus 
monkeys: 

"The primary function of aggressive play is the practice and 
perfection of skills in fighting and avoiding predators," writes 
Professor Donald Symons in his just-published book, Play aad 
Aureu.!on: A Study of Rhesus Monkey. (Columbia University 
Press) . 

Noting that play·flghting by juveniles is much more frequent 
and intense amODJr males than females. and that winnilll real 
filhta is an important determinant of reproductive success among 
adult males, Symons hypothesizes that allressive play "was 
shaped by natural selection for the function of developin, and 
perfecting competitive skills ." 

"It is unacceptable to many students of animal behavior," 
concludes Symons, "that play should be the origin of skill in tooth 
and claw."

Kickers Shut 
Out Lorna, 
Beat · Baptist 

By Karen Hunter 
Sports Edllor 

"Lucky Friday" turned out to 
be just that for the UCSD men's 
soccer team as they shut out 
Point Lorna, 2~, last Friday 
afternoon at Muir Field . 

"This game, as well as our 
next three, was really impor-
tant for us," remarked coach 
Stewart Hayes. Hayes cited 
Shahporr Essapoor and Bruce 
Logan for playing well against 
the Point Lorna squad. Each 
man scored one of the Triton's 
goals. 

"Bruce is really starting to 
play well. He's had some really 
close long range (35 feet) shots 
that have just missed the goal. .. 

The team had 18 tries com-
pared to Point Loma 's 1. "We 
played very well defensively, " 
added Hayes. 

Cal Baptist was the team's 
second victim of the weekend 
as the Tritons pulled out a 3-1 
victory on Saturday, bringing 
their overall season record t04-
3-l. 

Hayes feels that his team 
played "quite well." 

"We were prepared for them 
after we heard a lot of good 
things about one of their 
players." Apparently this 
player was not as good as 
expected. The Tritons suc-
ceeded in drawing him out of 
position numerous times, 
a llowing Shahporr to make 
several key crossovers. 

"Shahpoor played an out-
s tanding game," praised 
Hayes. "His dribbling and 
crossing over were excellent. 
This was his day." 

Shahpoor, along with Sam 
Tam and Wansoo Kim, put in 
the UCSD scores. Bruce Logan 
aided with two assists. 

"Bruce will be a big thing for 
us in mid-field if he keeps it 
up, " Hayes commented. 

The team has two big games 
coming up this week . On 
Monday they face Riverside on 
Muir Field at 3 pm. Thursday's 
game against USIU will be 
played at La Jolla Country Day 
chool starting at 3 pm. 

Why was this meet so impor-
tant to the Tritons? For two 
years Point Loma College has 
openly snubbed the UCSD cross 
country team. Last year they 
sent their top 3 runners to 
another event and barely beat 
the Tritons in a dual meeLThis 
year, they sent their top seven 
men to the Stanford Invita-
tional and their "B" team to 
UCSD . With this effort, as 
Coach Skief put it, "UCSD has 
shown Point Loma that we can 
compete with their number one 
team. Next year, they'll know 
that if they don't send their best 

" Having four meets on our 
home course will really help us 
at the end of the season when we 
race on the district finals ' 
course in La Mirada," said 
Coach Skief. "That course is at 
least 30 seconds to a minute 
faster than ours ." 

An important note - there 
will be a meeting this Thurs-
day, October 19, at 7 pm in the 
Rec Gym Conference Room for 
all those interested in men's 
and women's track and field .

OVER $650 A 

If you're a junior or a senior majoring in math, physics or 
engineering, the Navy has a program you should know about. 

It's called the Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate-
Collegiate Program (NUPOC-C for short) and if you qualify, 
you can earn as much as $650 a month right through your 
senior year. Then after 16 weeks of Officer Candidate School, 
you'll receive an additional year of advanced technical 
education. This would cost you thousands in a civilian school, 
but in the Navy, w~ pay you. And at the end of the year of 
training, you'll receive a $3,000 cash bonus. 

I t isn't easy. The!e are fewer than 400 openings and only 
one of every six applicants will be selected. But if you make 
it, you'll have qualified for an elite engineering training 
program. With unequaled hands-on responsibility, a $24,000 
salary in four years, and gilt-edged qualifications for jobs 
in private industry should you decide to leave the Navy 
later. (But we don't think you'll want to.) 

Ask your placement officer to set up an interview with a 
Navy representative when he visits the campus on Oct. 17-18, 
or contact your Navy representative at 293-6444. 
If you prefer, send your resum~ to the Navy Nuclear Officer 
Program, Code 312-B537, 4015 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, 
Va. 22203, and a Navy representative will contact you directly. 
The NUPOC-Collegiate Program. It can do more than help 
you finish college: it can lead to an exciting career opportunity.

By Joseph Reiner 
Director Robert Altman said 

m an interview that the idea to 
make A Wedding began as the 
retort to an annoYing reporter 
that for his next project he was 
gOing to take wedding pictures . 
The fruition IS a film con-
ce rning the mteractlons of two 
families at the rece ption of a 
morning wedding. The groom 's 
wealthy Episcopal family and 
the bride 's Irish nouvea u-riche 
clan move through a day of 
comical incident and drunken 
indiscretIOns. 

In the opening scene we see 
the interior 0 1 a grand church.

reveal a senile bIshop bungling

his attempt to perform a formal 
wedding. Before calling for his 
next slide , Altman shows us 
that what he has called "soci· 
ety's last big ritual " is a big 
joke , Later we witness the 
family doctor drinking scotch 
as he dispenses a syringe of 
dope to the groom's mother; 
everywhere in the film people 
a re failing the roles of the old 
morality and must be propped 
up with the aid of drugs , 
professional help or sympa-
thetic servants , 

The scenes of A Wedding 
usually meet at angles to one 
another, they are like panels in 
a fresco . Occasionally they 
hinge together to form the 
threads of stories (the fat art 
collector falling for the bride 's 
mother , played by Carol 
Burnett, or the exaggerated 
promiscuity of the unmarried 
sister, silently portrayed by 
Mia Farrow) but as in Nash-
ville the scenes build to 
nowhere , they ~re simply 
extended jokes. Altman out-
lined the scenes of A Wedding 
a head of time, but did notdothe 
actual. scripting until it was 
time to shoot them . As in 
several of his other films the 
actors helped do the writing, so 
that the performances some-
time take on the air of improvi-
sation; because of this , Iitt~e 
overall tension or rhythm IS 
built an,d we are not left with 
a ny strong feeling when the 
movie ends. For all of Altman 's 
attempts to produce a series of 
snapshots on QlIr culture, ~is 
style dislocates the material 
and the end result is more like a 
slap-stick soap opera . 

Altman arranged to do his 
shooting at the mansion of a 
genuinely rich mid-west family 
similiar to the Sloan family of 
the movie . He hired wedding 
designers similar to the ones 
this class of people would 
actually hire . The crew and 48

Odyssey 
Hollywood Party Tonight -
Odyssey (RCA) 

Hollywood Party Tonight 
would be a perfect record at a 
party - for frontal lobotomy 
patients. Only they and persons 
hard up ror pseudo-disco-R '" B-
AM type music could find 
Odyssey 's album interesting. 

The song titles are the most 
entertaining parts of the 
album. In the ca tegory or 
longest title we have " You 
Wouldn't Know A Real Live 
True Love II It Walked Right 
Up, Kissed You On The CtJeek 
And Said Hello Baby." And for 
the stupidist sounding, " Hey 
Bill (Last Night Was Really A 
Thrill) ... 

Although ten musicians are 
mentioned on the sleeve , one 
wonders where they were when 
the final mix was made. If the 
sound was any more "airy" the 
record would be in danger of 
floating off the turntable. 

Basically, Odyssey.is Lillian 
Lopez, Louise Lopez and Billy 
McEachern. They come across 
like a two-dimensional Fifth 

·Dimension. One or the groups' 
first mistakes may have been to 
record in West Orange, New 
Jersey. Who ever heard of 
recording in New Jersey? I 
suppose it'sa nice place tovisit, 
but to record there? 

The production is good, but 
the arrangements date back to 
pre-Musak and are fairly 
boring . Occasionally , the 
special effects are not bad . 
Most are basi c electronic 
wizardry, but come through 
nicely . 

It is evident this group was 
intent upon recording some 
kind of music, but it is not clear 
what kind, Hollywood Party 
Tonight lies in the twilight zone 
among disco, rhythm and blues 
a nd top 40 hits. It is too weak in 
each area to bridge a ny gap. 
Perhaps the only good use this 
record could be put to would be 
as a frisbee ata beach party.-

The Heep 
Fallen Angel - Uriah Heep 
(Bronze) 

Supposedly from Uriah Heep 
one expects a forty-five minute 
dose of heavy metal rock and 
roll with no regard for the 
listener ' s eardrum . Fallen 
Angel is an exception. 

Three or ten selections on the 
album can possibly be clas-
sified as hard rock, while the 
remaining sound like &ston 
reruns and A.M. hits. 

One thing not lacking on the 
record is love . The band 
manages to squeeze "love" into

brings the streak to an end. 

The remaining tunes are of 
the AM radio type grade, fairly 
weak in all departments.

-Wier Shortage Possible in 1 0 Years 

By JoeeIYD LarklII 
San Die 0 could be facing a 

severe water shortage in the 
next ten years. according to 
infonnation released by the 
County Board of Supervisors. 

Population projections esti-
mate 40 .000 to 60 .000 new 
residents in the San Diego area 
per year. creating greater 
demands on water resources, 
according to the report re-
leased last month. 

San Diego imports 95% of its 
water supply from a distance of 
up to 700 miles. Colorado River 

water, an essential resource for 
San Diego, may be less depend-
able in the near future. as 
Arizona and Los Angeles will be 
making claims for a share of its 
vplume. the report said. 

Water from Northern Cali-
fornia is exceedingly expensive 
to transport, and as last year's 
drought has proven, is un-
reliable as a major supplier of 
San Diego's growing need. It is 
estimated by the State Water 
Resources Board that by 1984 
the price of imported water will 
have doubled froUl its present 

average rate of $85 per acre 
foot. 

Coordinated by County Su-
pervisors Roger Hedgecock 
and Tom Hamilton. the San 
Diego Water Re-use Committee 
has initiated an extensive 
program of water reclamation , 
designed to secure the future of 
San Diego's water supply . 
Providing for twenty reclama-
tion facilities throughout the 
county. the project is expected 
to be completed in Spring. 1980. 

The aim of the project would 
be to treat sewage in order that

it can be used for non-potable 
purposes. including the ir-
rigation of golf courses. recrea-
tional areas and freeways . At 
present. San Diego water is 
used only once, then thrown 
back into the ocean after 
treatment. This long-range 
project of reclamation will free 
large quantities of potable 
water. which can be allocated 
in the future for drinking water. 
Proposed sites for reclamation 
plants nearby include Del Mar. 
Encinitas and Leucadia. 

The newest aspect of the 
project, publicly disclosed this 
week. involves the exporting-of 
reclaimed water from San 
Diego County into the Imperial 
Valley for agricultural pur-
poses. At present. 18o/Q of our 
water supply is earmarked for 
irrigation of farm lands. 
transported at great expense to 
farmers. 

-

Extensive research of water 
reuse methods preceded the 
initiation of this project. The 
goal of the project, according to 
Diane Barlow, administrative 
assistant to Supervisor Hedge-
cock. is to "produce water 
which is the best quality as well 
as -cost and energy efficient." 
As San Diego water already 
contains a high concentration 
of salts. reclamation (by means 
of a process known as reverse 
osmosis) must be particularly 
thorough in order to meet 
quality standards for agri-
culture, according to Barlow. 

The cost of the entire project 
is estimated at $657.000 or 
approximately $50.000 per · 
reclamation plant. The project 
is being funded primarily by a 
federal grant. in conjunction 
with the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency,. and is supple-
mented by state and local 
funding .

San Diego area police dis-

covered only Thursday that 
Smith would be here Saturday. 
Members of the press were 
allowed into the luncheon but 
were not allowed to ask Smith 
questions . 

Smith said he is willing to 
meet with the Patriotic Front. 
as urged by Carter, if " neces-
sary preliminary planning for 
constructive action" is con-
ducted and if there are " no 
preconditions. " But. said 
Smith. the Front is not in-
terested in meeting. only in 
fighting. "They are terrorists 
committing acts of unmitigated 
bestiality and brutality that 
cause civilized men the world 
over to recoil." -

"They kill 30 to 40 innocent 
ci vi lians. mostly black. a 
year. " he added. "These 
terrorists are the forces that 
the United States and Britain 
want to fonn the future mili-
tary of Rhodesia." 

Patriotic Front leaders 
Robert Mugabwe and Hoshua 
Nkomo are supported materi-
ally by China and the Soviet 
Union respectively _ Cubans 
have been training the guer-
rillas. 

" Rhodesia is in danger of 
becoming the ideological 
battleground of the commun-
ists," Smith said. Rhodesian 
military forces, he said. have 
seized guerrilla documents in 
Mozambique which state goals 
of "gaining complete power 
without compromise" and that 
" detente will preclude the 
emergence of the socialist 
state." 

Also, said Smith, the docu-
ment confinned what he called 
Mugabwe 's suspicions that 
NltomoJl is trying to destroy 
Mupbwe's forces by letting

Smith Says Patriotic

(Cont. from page 10) 
Rhodesia." he said. 

FuU franchised elections 
were promised (or the end of 
this year · by the interim 
government. But. " my guess is 
that will overflow by a few 
months. this isn't meant to 
indicate any d.eviousness on 
anybody's part. " Patriotic 
Front forces have said they will 
shell polling places. 

The Front, Smith said. knows 
it has no internal support and 
therefore won't come into the 
country. He claimed the three 
blacks of the Council are 
supported by 85% of the black 
population .of Rhodesia . 

Criticism by Rhodesian 
blacks of the Council blacks has 
been increasing. Rhodesia has 
about 280,000 whites and '6,7 
million blacks. (i ' :' , , 

Slthole. the only blacNIU"~ 
talk, said the war is nOl~ 
race but one of franchi.t "No 
that we have full vote therei_. 
need for war." Both the United 
State. and United Kingdom. 
Sitbole said, are cOftCe_d 
wjth leadership of Rhodesia 
rather tban the violent situa lion 
at hand. 

Sithole spent ten years in jail 
for trying to assassinate Smith. 
He said they work together now 
because they believe in "on 
man one vote ... 

He referred to Bhodesja as 
Zimabawe, ·the black nation-
alist name that has been 
accepted by the United Na-
tions . The U.N . Security 
Council currently holds econo-
mic sanctions against Rho-
desia. 

Rhodesia declared itself 
independent of Britain in 1965. 
an act which Britain never 
recognized.

rhe Naval Flight Officer

Flying is one of the greatest challenges a man can face. But getting a 
Navy jet or multi-engine prop into the air and down again is only 
part of the job. 

That's where the Naval Flight Officer comes in. He's the man on 
the team who takes over when the plane is airborne and it's time to 
see the mission through to its ultimate success. 

As a Naval Flight Officer, you'll operate radar, navigation 
equipment, and the most advanced electronic systems in the sky. 

The tools you'll work with are some of the most sophisticated 
ever developed. And most of them are classified. 

It·s a demanding job. The qualifications are high. And the

Longer prison Hnteaces 
serve 81 finite deterrents to 
violent c me, said attorney 
,eneral dandidate Yvonne 
Burke Saturday night at a 
campailn fundraiser. 

"The career criminal is the 
person we have to focus our 
attention on," said Burke, a 
current Los Angeles congress-
woman. A criminal that has 
served a longer prison sentence 
will think twice before re-
peating the c~me , she added.

At tile fundraiJer, SpolHlOred 

by Colleen O'Connor, lister of 
San DleiO. Councilwoman 
Maureen O'Connor, Burke 
seemed in load spirits, later 
sayiDl the poDs indicated she 
was pulling -away from her 
opponent, State Senator George 
Deukmejian. 

Burke said she chose to run 
for attorney general because 
"This is a position where one's 
decisions will have a real 
impact on people and- where 
you really shape policy." Her 
press secretary said earlier 
that Burke's present position as 
congresswoman makes it 
difficult to introduce change 
and does not allow her to help 
people. 

Burke outlined several steps 
for law enforcement at the local 
level to take in order to reduce 
crime. "That is where the main 
work must be done. Police 
forces in the communities must 
be expanded so that people will 
see that the chances of being 
caught for committing a crime 
are high ," said Burke. Meas-
ures similar to th recent 
Senate bill 709 , which increased 
prison sentences for violent 
crimes, are also needed , she 
added. 

Burke said Proposition 7, 
which would widen the scope of 
the current death penalty laws, 
"would only serve to confuse 
the system we have ." The 
congresswoman said as attor-

ney general she would enforce 
and carry out any laws con-
cerning the death penalty, but 
that personally she doe. not Uke 
the idea of a death penalty. 

"I believe in gun regiltration.

had attempted to discourage 
them, but could take little or no 
legal action . 

Preliminary findings from an 
audit of the physicians' ac-
tivities , called by Moxley , 
indicate that the surgeons did 
not actually violate any of the 
University rules in their 
arrangement with Kern. Fur-
thermore , members of the 
medical school staff can take 
up to three days of leave every 
three months as a consultant 
without having to report to the 
University. 

The VA Hospital administra-
tion takes a much stronger 
position on the arrangement 
with Kern County , as the 
dismissal of Orloff and Peskin 
would indicate. It is the opinion 
of many members of the UCSD 
staff and administration that 
the action against the two 
physicians is an overreacton on 
the part of the VA. 

While several of the physi-
ci ans sought and obtained 
permission for travel to the 
Bakersfield hospital, many 
others went without authoriza-
tion and filed their time cards 
as if thev had remained on V A 
Hospital uty on those days. 
The inves gator's report shows 
that 10 VA surgeons made 51 
visits t o ' the Kern Medical 
Center n a 21-month period. 
Twenty ·f IIf of thirty-seven 
trips to rn County between 
July 19'~5: and October 1976, 
were mAde without authoriza-
tion, anri tailed to be recorded 
as absel\~S on VA time cards. 

When Or. Robert W. Braw-
ley, director of the VA Hospital 
learned that the trips to 
Bakersfield were essentially 
renumerative, he informed the 
surgical staff that he would no 
longer authorize the trips on VA 
time . In 14 t rips to Bakers-
fie ld , however , 11 were on days 

when the surgeons cards 
- recorded their time as spent at 
the VA Hospital. 

The investigator also found 
that s ix V A surgeons were 
logged for time at University 
Hospital when they were 
actually operating at the VA 
facility .
