Dukakis 
Appeals 
For Votes 
By SETH SLATER 
Staff Writer 

As part of his final push toward 
the White House, Democratic 
presidential candidate Michael 
Oukakis spoke briefly to an 
enthusiastic crowd of supporters 
in San Diego's Horton Plaza last 
Monday afternoon, just 1 S days 
before the Nov. 8 election. 

Oukakis began on a note of 
optimism. 

"Either you're all crazy or we're 
going to win the '88 election, " he 
said, sizing up the crowd. "We're 
a little behind right now, but 
we're fighting back. The Republi-
cans want you to tbink it's over. 
They're popping those cham-
pagne corks in their penthouses, 
but I want to tell them something: 
we're the ones that are going to 
be celebrating." 

In an appeal for votes at the 
close of his speecb, the Massa-
cbusetts governor pointed to the 
1960 presidential election and 
the narrow marlin whicb placed 
Jobn F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. 
Johnson in tbe Wbite House as 
evidence that voters can swing 
close elections. 

"Just remember 1960: .. what 
you're doing can make all the 
difference ... that's why this elec-
tion is so important." 

Oukakis also denounced Vice 
President George Bush's cam-
paign tactics. which California 
Senator Alan Cranston said, 
minutes earlier, made for "a 
campaign ofJies and distortions. " 

Oukakis said tbat Bush resorts 
to spread in. "political garba.e" 
because "he can't win an election 
where the real issues are dis-
cussed."

benefit Bush. 
"Mr. Bush wants to help people 

who already bave made it," 
Dukakis said a few moments 
before turning to the tax issue. "I 
want to help every American 
family make it. He wants to help 
tbe people on easy street. I want 
him to help the people on main 
street and that's tbe fundamental 
difference between us ... 

fresh and an honored profession." 
Dukakis tben turned toward 

the issue of illegal drug use in the 
United States and criticized the 
Reagan Administration's lack of 
aggressiveness in waging what he 
called a "phony war" against 
drugs.

U C Enrollment Going 
Up, Says Atkinson 
By SUSAN E. HYLEN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson has disclosed the results 
of a new study on projected UC 
enrollment. which predicts that 
UCSD, UC Irvine and UC Davis 
will Jrow by more than 26,000 
students by the year 200S. 

Speaking to the UCSD Aca-
demic Senate last Tuesday, 
Atkinson related the contents of a 
presentation on the study made 
by UC President David Gardner 
to the Reaents last week. 

According to the study, UC 
Irvine has the highest projected 
rate of Jrowth of any UC school. 
UC Berkeley, on the other hand, 
will actually be smaller, with 
enrollment dropping to a total of 
20,000 undergraduates. 

Atkinson found the "most dis-
turbin. aspect of this report" to 
be the comparison of the per-
centa.e of graduate students at 
UC schools with thOle of other 
universities. UC has 11.2 percent 
graduate enrollment, while sel-
ected public institutions nation-
wide averaae 18.1 percent, and 
private colleges average 32.9 per-
cent. 

According to the projected 
:.rowth rate, UCSD's graduate 
population would grow from 
1,817 to 5,000 students in the year 
200S. This figure would then 
represent 20 percent of the stu-
dent body. 

Atkinson also expressed con-
cern for future faculty recruitment, 
which he said "is going to be a 
monumental task" in the mid-
1990's, when student enrollment 
increases due to a projected rise in 

the popUlation of high school 
Jraduates. 

To provide for the increase in 
students, Gardner has proposed 
that three new UC campuses be 
built. 

Compounding the difficulty 
presented by increased enrollment, 
Atkinson indicated that by the 
year 2000, 50 percent of UCSD's 
full-time faculty will have retired. 
To offset the retirements, Atkin-
son said UCSD would have to 
hire 40 faculty members each/ear. 

Atkinson said that as 0 this 
year, UCSO had more applica-
tions per available student opening 
than any other school in the 
system. Also, the school was 
second only to Berkeley in the 
SAT and GPA requirements for 
edrollment. 

Turning to Affirmative Action, 
Atkinson admitted that there is 
"no question that the university 
has tremendous problems in that 
area." He said that while recruit-
ment of minority students has 
improved, the school is "really 
failing in the faculty and in the 
administration areas. " 

"We're going to be very aggres-
sive in helping these [minority] 
appointments move through the 
process," Atkinson said, pointing 
to · Professor Nolan E. Penn's 
appointment as associate chan-
cellor to assist in this endeavor. 

Atkinson also emphasized the 
importance of ballot Proposition 
78, which authorizes the sale of 
$600 million in general obligation 
bonds to fund construction and 
renovation projects over the next 
two years at UC, CSU, and the 
community colleges. Atkinson 
said "no campus has more to lose

Rape Occurs in UC Davis Dorm Room 

A UC Davis student was arrested Sunday 
morning on felony charges for sexual assaults of a 
'7-year-old female student that reportedly occurred 
in a campus dormitory. 

Following the young woman's report that she had 
been raped in her Gilmore Hall dorm room at 
approximately 3:30 a.m., university police arrived at 
the dormitory and arrested Patrick McGovern 
without further incident, according to Sgt. Mike 
Corkery of the UC Davis Police Department. 

Witnesses have indicated that alcohol was 
apparently involved, Corkery said, "but we're 
waiting for lab reports. And that may take a month 
(for those results)." 

The victim sought medical attention at Sutter-
Davis Medical Center, Corkery added. 

McGovern, described as an I8-year-old, 5-foot-10-
inch male, was released on SI5,OOO bail later that 
morning and is scheduled to appear in Davis 
Municipal Court on Nov. II, according to county 
jail sources. 

This is the fourth rape reported to local police in 
the last month. All reports indicate that the victims 
were acquainted with the suspects, and that alcohol 
was involved in each incident.

UC Davis Suspends Fraternity and 
Places Two Under Investigation 

The UC Davis Planning Commission has ordered 
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity to cease 
activities as a Greek organization, following 
unanimous approval of a motion to revoke the 
fraternity's conditional-use permit. 

The commission justified its decision on the 
grounds that the fraternity is detrimental to public 
welfare, citing police records of noise complaints 
and testimony given at a recent public hearing. 

In a related motion, also unanimously approved 
by the commission, the Sigma Nu ~nd K.ap~a Alpha 
fraternities have been placed under investigation for 
similar reasons: nine noise complaints against these 
fraternities have also been formally registered with 
the police department over the last two years. 

Reports submitted by the police department 
included violations of the noise ordinance, 
inadequate maintenance of the property, trespassing

and parking problems. 
In addition to those reports and complaints 

delivered during the hearing Tuesday night, 
commissioners noted violations of the state penal 
code concerning alcohol consumption, contained in 
a report from the university. 

In January, the university began investigating the 
fraternity as a result of a complaint filed by a UC 
Davis student, stating that she had been sexually 
assaulted after being served spiked beverages at a 
party at the fraternity's house at S2l Russell Blvd. 

Although the findings of these investigations, 
published in June, did not substantiate the allegation 
of rape, the university did confirm that SAE was 
guilty of serving alcohol to minors.

Dog Da~' s 
"More than 140 racing greyhounds were killed at a Chandler Heighrs 
kennel almost two months ago when someone poisoned their feed 
with a pesticide used to kill ticks. The mass slaying. the largest such 
incident in Arizona history, went strangely unreported. The dead 
dogs ' carcasses were scattered across the desert and left to 
decompose . .. 

Pltoe"ix New Times 

P hoenix - The Dog Mas was late for dinner again on Saturday. He had disappeared around sundown on Friday into the maw 
of some personal squabble involving drugs, treachery and 

perhaps violence, according to his reed-thin wife, who made his 
excuses on the telephone and said she was getting extremely nervous 
about his lifestyle. "He is getting crazier and crazier," she said. "We 
came out here to get away from all that, but this place is worse than 
Buffalo . These people have no morals." • 

His name was Arthur. He was about SO years old, drove a white 
Mercedes 450 and wore three orfour heavy gold chains around his neck ; 
they hung loose on his hairy chest, exposed by the cleavage of slick 
Rayon shirts, which he never buttoned above the sternum. 

Our reservations for Saturday were for 7:30 in the clubhouse at 
Greyhound Park, the flagship of the dog-racing industry in the 
Southwest. I had met Arthur a few weeks earlier, under deeply 
criminal circumstances that seemed to have nothing to do, at the 
time, with dog-racing . ... But in the course of our talks he revealed 
that he was, in fact, a Master Handicapper, a recognized wizard in 
the business of gambling on fast greyhounds. 

So when he suggested that we "do a night at the doggies," as he put 
it, I quickly agreed . I have won money from time to +ime on almost 
every other proposition known to English-speakinr, man - and one 
or two others, for that matter - but my limite j experience with 
dog-racing had been a total loss .. . . But now, with Arthur on my side, 
I had a wild new feeling that the worm was about to turn. 

It was almost 9 when he arrived, just before the sixth race. I had 
already lost something like 19 straight bets on everything from 
Quinellas to Trifectas to crazy-acting skeletal-looking dogs with 
names like Jaded Angel, Coldwater Floyd and Big Trouble. 

Maria somehow had won three out of six races, including one 
Quinella. The crowd was calm, and the whistling theme song from 
The Bridge Over the River Kwai was playing relentlessly in the 
clubhouse, after each race, on speakers mounted behind the pari-
mutual windows. 

Letters 

'Date Rape' 
Good Topic 
EdItor: 

I found Lewis Call's letter on 
non-sexist language disturbing 
(Guardian, Oct. 24). 

The issue of sexism and the 
English language is difficult, lar-
gely due to the different mean-
ings of man throughout history. 

There is room for disagree-
ment about whether it is worth 
trying to restructure the language 
in gender-neutral terms. 

What I found distressing was 
Call's anger at having once inad-
vertently attended a talk on "date 
rape." 

I'm not sure why this topic 
fails, in his view, to address the 
task of "teaching men and women 
to live with one another." Isn't 
the message "Don't force sex on 
someone" a valid and necessary 
lesson that our society has yet to 
learn? If Call had paid attention 
to the seminar, he might know 
how sickening common rape is in 
America. 

Traditionally , society has 
blamed the victim of rape. In his 
letter, Call accuses those who are 
working to prevent rape of 
"preaching nothing but paranoia 
and distrust between us." I guess 
in his view the problem isn't the 
reality of rape, but all this un-
pleasant talk about it. 

His definition of "paranoia" 
seems to be concern about a 
crime of which he is 'not a likely 
victim. 

Arthur was jabbering with rage when we got there. A drunken 
Indian, he said, had tried to mess with his car while he was watching 
the Arizona-Arizona St. game on TV and losing "thousands of 
dollars." @:;: 

Every sensible woman in this 
country lives with the reality that 
she might someday be raped. 
The sickness is not in the minds 
of women, it's in our society. 

It is said that Call didn't feel 
any inclination to learn about a 
subject that causes so much pain 
in the lives of so many women 
and the men who care about 
them. It is tragic that seminars 
on rape, "date" or otherwise, are 
needed.

I was very much dismayed by 
your two front-page articles a-
bout the visit by Sen. Lloyd 
Bentsen (Guardian, Oct. 20). 

Not once in the two articles 
was it mentioned that the var-
ious Democratic Clubs of UCSD 
had less than 48 hours to mobil-
ize, organize and stage the entire 
event. Not once was the hard 
work of volunteers and organiz-

T he clubhouse at Greyhound Park is known for its fine food and excellent service. The dogs run six nights a week here, dinner 
reservations are made far in advance and "proper attire" is 

mandatory for admission to the crowded, glass-enclosed dining area, 
which looks out on the finish line, the finely groomed track and the 
bright green grass of the infield area. 

Koala Cartoon Raises a Ruckus 

The gr.ndstand is one of the tallest buildings in South Phoenix, 
dwarfed only by the high white tube of the control tower at Sky 
Harbor Airport, only a mile or so away. There is a distinctly horizon-
tal cast to the architecture here, reflecting a sense of available space 
that would be considered almost criminal in any other million-
population city in America. 

Greyhound Park is not your typical dog-racina facility. There is 
valet parking for the clubhouse, crisp new $2 bills at the parimutuel 
windows and white linen tablecloths on the dinner tables. Even the 
napkins are linen. 

The dog-racing industry is no small thing in Arizona . More than 
$80 million is wagered annually at six tracks, four of them wholly 
owned and operated by the infamous Buffalo-based "Em prise 
Corp.," the subject of numerous criminal investigations. 

A rthur is not in the dog-racing business, and he knows nothing at all about politics. He is a "financial consultant" bv day and hard-edged criminal by night. His" Arizona-style" is in one of 
the blue-chip neighborhoods of Sc'otb :lale, where the air pollution 
index for carbon monoxide on any given day runs twice as high as it 
does in the "low rent areas" around the airport and Greyhound Park 
- Phoenix has the "worst air in America," according to EPA figures 
out of Washington, D.C. 

It is no accident of cowboy architecture that the clubhouse at 
Greyhound Park is hermetically sealed offfrom the outside world by 
glass walls and a plainclothes S W A T team of well-mannered security 
gU?Tds. There is weirdness out there in the desert , along with human 
skulls decomposing and t he carcasses of 140 racing greyhounds and 
the ghost Winnie Ruth Judd . 

When 1 asked Arthur about the dead animals, he shrugged and 
said, "Business is business; I guess somebody didn't pay their bills." 
That is the prevailing attitude down here. 

We gam!::!::! continuously for the remainder of the night, and by 
the end of the 15th race I was cleaned out, and so was Arthur. His 
wife was weeping softly as he led her away to the parking lot .. . and as 
we passed the main office I sent Maria inside to ask about the 
possibility of buying "a stuffed greyhound" - a real one, done by a 
taxidermist. 

The night manager was horrified . "That's a very unusual request," 
she said. "I can't think of anyborly around here who does that kind of 
th.ing. It would cost more than a dog would be worth." 

SAACSays 
It's Racist 
Editor: 

We, the members ofthe SAAC, 
find the cartoon "Confucious Sez" 
harmful and contradictory to our 
goals of improving the welfare of 
the disabled, women and students 
of color and the quality of edu-
cation at UCSD. 

Cross-cultural communication 
often presents challenging, possib-
ly humorous, situations in UCSD's 
classrooms. Misunderstandings 
will occur with any professor 
regardless of national origin. 
Targetting Chinese professors and 
TA's with the title "Confucious 
Sez" and a dehumanizing carica-
ture of an Asian man is racist and 
unfair. 

We hope that the Koala and all 
the students realize that foreign 
profes Drs and T As enhance the 
ed ucational quality of UCSD by 
bringing a broader perspective 
and more knowledge to the cam-
pus. Communication problems 
should be met with patience and 
understanding, not racism and 
ridicule. 

Although the intentions of the 
artists may have been benign, the 
negative effects of this cartoon on 
the Asian-American population 
at UCSD and the student body as 
a whole are serious. Though the 
cartoon may draw laughs from a 
few students, it will offend persons 
of Chinese or Asian descent and 
alienate the Asian-American 

This is one panel of a Koala car-
lOon by Milo Cooper and Marri 
Siltanen that is thefocus ofa con-
troversy involving charges of 
racism. The Koala plans an apol-
ogy today or tomorrow. 

student community from the 
broader college community. 

One of the major goals for 
SAAC is to promote interracial 
understanding and to create a 
diverse yet unified student body 
which is sensitive to all students' 
needs and feelings . This cartoon 
and past material printed in the 
Koala hinder progress towards 
our goals. 

We believe an apology is due to 
the Asian-American students of 
UCSD, who comprise nearly 25 
percent oft he student body, in the 
form of a written statement in the 
next issue of the Koala.

English Skills 
Need Improving 
Editor: 
Joe Wainio has done it again 
(Guardian, Oct. 24). 

Once again an American has 
fallen back on the idea that if they 
don't like something and can't 
find any proper reason to criticize 
it, they call it "racism." 

Wainio obviously can't see the 
need for action on the problem of 
instructors who need improvement 
of their English skills. Most stu-
dents, especially in ECE, CSE, 
Math or Physics, have great diffi-
culty in understanding an instruc-
tor with a heavy accent. This is 
detrimental to the swuent and 
needs to be corrected . 

Although poor English may be 
connected with an individual's 
ethnic background, it is not fair 
for the students to have to learn 
another language in order to under-
stand their lectures. The language 
used to teach here at UCSD is 
English and all instructors should 
be able to speak clearly and under-
standably. 

For those of us who have had 
to suffer through this problem, 
the cartoon is funny, but perhaps 
only marginally so, because it also 
states a problem that needs cor-
recting. We can't start if some 
knee-jerkjumps up to cry "racism" 
every time we begin. The issue is 
education and whether the instruc-
tor can get the message across,

'Dorms' or 
'Res Halls?' 
Editor: 

Regarding the editorial "Fresh- . 
person?" (Guardian, Oct. 17), I 
would like to applaud the 
Guardian for their change to 
using the word "freshperson." I 
do not consider the change small 
or trivial. I see it as a significant 
change in support of your non" 
sexist program policy. 

In the same regard, I would 
like to recommend to the 
Guardian staff another small, 
but also significant, word usage 
change. I notice in the same 
article the use of the word 
"dorm," short for "dormitories." 

At Muir, we are making a 
conscious effort to exchange the 
use of the "0" word with the 
words, "residence halls." While 
it may seem like a trivial change 
to many, such a change would 
support our campus residential 
life philosophy of having living areas 
on campus where student de-
velopment is of primary importance. 

For an historical perspective, 
dormitories have signified places 
where in loco parentis prevailed 
and the personal ' growth of 
students was insignificant when 
compared to their academic 
development.

Bush League 
Performance 
Continued from pale .. 
ers mentioned in either article. 

Considering UCSO's reputa-
tion for holding large events, it is 
surprising that any candidate 
would want to come here . ... 
This, coupled with the reports of 
widespread student apathy and 
voter enrollment, makes us one 
of the least desirable campuses 
to speak on. That has all changed 
since the Bentsen event. 

What the Guardian did men-
tion is that Bush protestors were 
not allowed into the circle (in 
which you needed special blue 
passes). I was handling our blue 
passes, so I know who they were 
made available to: people who 
were interested in listening to 
Bentsen s speech. 

The Bush supporters showed 
all of us why they weren't allowed 
into the circle - they were more 
interested in making noise and 
hollering than they were in lis-
tening to Bentsen's speech. let-
ting this rabble closer to the 
stage would have only robbed 
those who wanted to hear Bent-
sen's speech. 

Mixing these two groups would 
have only been asking for trou-
ble. After what happened at the 
Untouchables' concert and what 
that did to our reputation, can 
we afford another near riot? No. 
I think the way the event was 
organized, especially considering 
the time frame, was excellent. 

Because the event went smooth-
ly, UCSO is back on the political 
map. Candidates, both Demo-
crat and Republican, will look 
at this event and see that this 
school does have political inter-
est, that students do care what is 
going on around them politically. 

They also know that when the 
chips are down and time is 
limited, they can rely on hard" 
working student volunteers.

of the front page stories menti-

crats, an inside story accompan·

DUKAKIS: 
Democratic

The governor said that he and 
Bentsen would provide more 
enforcement for drug laws and 
would "double the amount of 
DEA [Drug Enforcement Agen-
cy] agents ... in Southern Calif-
ornia ... 

Dukakis said he also wants to 
bring down the demand for drugs 
by bringing drug education pro-
grams ~into the elementary grades 
of every school in the United 
States. "

Flood - A sea of posters greets Dukakis at speech. 

The candidate then spoke on 
environmental concerns, saying 
that one of the most painful 
experiences of his campaign was 
meeting with two families whose 
children had suffered form ail- ~--------------------------' 
ments that he implied were 
related to unsafe environmental 
conditions. 

Dukakis vowed to clean up 
toxic waste dumps and said he 
would work at "protecting the 
people, not the polluters. " 

Democratic interest in a clean 
environment, Oukalc:is said, is 
not limited to protection of the 
nation'S natural resources. 

"Beginning in January of 1989, 
we're going to have clean air, 
clean water and clean coasts and 
a clean government in Washing-
ton D.C.," he said. . 

After pausing for the crowd's 
cheers, Dukakis expressed his 
desire to "slam shut that revolving 
door in the White House," and 
said that staff members in his 
administration would be pro-
hibited from lobbying federal 
agencies upon leaving their posts. 

Dukakis' closing remarks were 
addressed to his supporters, who 
included members of the United 
Farm Workers Union, in Spanish 
and reflected his optimistic view 
of the Democratic ticket's grad-
ual, but steady progress toward 
the White House in the last weeks 
before the election. He translated 
as he spoke. 

"Poco a poco, little by little; 
paso a paso, step by step; mano 
en mano, hand in hand; junto, 
together; vamos a ganar, we're 
going to win."

High School Students Perform For Charity. 

HauntedHouse Spooks Even Big Kids 
By AMANDA LEVIN 
GUGrdian Intern 

J imgrabbed Elizabeth's hand, then, trying to pretend he 
wasn't scared , he dropped 

her hand and put his arm around 
her shoulders. 

The casual gesture was a bad 
one; at t hat exact moment a man 
looking very far beyond death 
leapt out in front of them, the 
shock of which caused Jim to 
squeeze Elizabeth maybe just a 
little bit too ha rd . Her scream 
went unnoticed as t he crowds of 
people in front of her and to the 
rear echoed her response. 

One scream in the dark, unno-
ticed in the ocean of others, a 
situation which Jackie Martin 
hopes will not bethe plight of San 
Diego's latch-key children much 
longer. 

Martin and her husband, Nels, 
have almost completely taken over 
the prod uction of the annual 

Scream in the Dark haunted house 
and carnival. a fundraiser for Safe 
San Diego. an organization pro-
viding counseling for "at risk" 
youth and their families. Martin 
and many others see this as one 
way to come to the aid of San 
Diego's latch-key population. 

Inaugurated by Campus Life, 
(the folks who bring all of the 
UCSD dorm dwellers those cute 
little Goodstuff boxes) nearly 
2S years ago. Scream in the Dark 
takes place as not only a local. but 
a nati onal event. Our local chap-
ter, riddled with problems in 
supervision and lack of enthusi-
asm, did not want to cont inue the 
project at one time. With the 
efforts of advisor Ken Overstreet 
and the Martins, however, the 
program has been kept alive. 

Overstreet, who is currently very 
ill, has been progressively hand-
ing over more and more of the 
production process to Jackie a nd 
Nels Martin. Now the Martins 
are basically running the whole 
show.

This is the first year the Scream 
in the Dark program has had a 
sole benefactor (Safe San Diego), 
but, in actuality, this counseling 
program is not the only group 
benefiting from the production. 

A group of San Diego high 
schools have been lucky enough 
to participate in this annual event, 
providing Scream in the Dark 
with its ghosts and goblins. Ad-
vanced drama students from high 
schools including Patrick Henry, 
Castle Park, Mira Mesa, Chula 
Vista, Chula Vista School for 
Creative and Performing Arts, 
Santana, West Hills and Valll8l1a 
have pooled their talents to create 
a wonderfully entertaining and 
chilling experience. 

As visitors creep through the 
dimly lit maze, different scenes 
(including the famous Phantom 
of the Opera , a torture chamber 
a nd an insane asylum) greet your 
eyes with gruesome airs of horror 
and gore. 

Martin, producer of the event, 
is very pleased with the 1988 cast 
and remarked, "It is very demand-
ing to perform from 6:30 to II 
p.m. every night , but they [the 
actors] love it. " 

The age of the audience varies , 
though it seems apparent that 
this is meant to be a haunted 
house for the big kids. 

Although college students may 
not anticipate real scares from 
Scream in the Dark, one group of 
UCSD students stood in the 
quickly-moving line and aU had 
time to notice that they were not 
surrounded by knee-high squeal-
ers. Actually, they probably com-
prised the lower part of the age 
average. 

There is only one rule at Scream 
in the Dark and it applies to both 
the actors and the audience. This 
simple rule is that visitors are not 
supposed to touch anyone or any-
thing; and so visitors are also pro-
tected from being touched. Many 
people have come to the conclu-
sion that rules are meant to be 
broken, at least Scream's usher 
Igor thinks so. 

As visitors walk boldly into the 
darkness. a very ugly face comes 
within micrometers of their own 

- and it is not one of their friends 
- it is dusty, musty, and yes, 
crusty Igor. 

One member of the audience 
jumped back thinking, "He can-
not touch me," but Ilor reached 
out and proved her very wrong 
with a not so encouraJinl pat on 
the back. Okay, so maybe it's not 
a rule, but perhaps a sugestion? 

Going through the various hall-
ways, visitors encounter the Mad 
Doctor's operating room whose 
special effects were described fairly 
accurately by Third Collele fresh-
person Jen Johnson, who called 
them "totally dislusting. " 

The Torture Chamber is an-
other scene that has very sophisti-
cated detail. Also deservinl special 
recognition are the Jirls who enact 
the psycho ward . With the words, 
"Home Sweet Home"neurotically 
scrawled across one wall in blood 

and some of the best performances 
of the night, it is one of the most 
chilli", and memorable parts of 
the darkside. 

Movinl on to the left, a Jlimpse 
of lilht is caulht. It looks like 
moonlight refiectinl off of some 
kind of metal object that moves 
quickly to conceal its identity. 

Then it can be seen clearly. It is 
Fred Kreuger lurching forward, 
not only with open arms but an 
open right fist. The costume and 
the voice are too accurate and the 
motions too quick for comfort. 
Members of the audience cannot 
help but jump back and scream, 
loud. 

Third College freshperson 
Claudine Miller gleefully recalled 
people's reactions to Freddy, the 
best special effect of the nilht.

Rubes® By Leigh Rubin Scream In the Dark 

Appropriate symbol for the 
consequences of Halloween candy. 

Continued from pale 8 
The sight of the California Red 

Ribbon booth outside of the maze 
was a true relief. The Red Ribbon 
program for a drug-free America 
is recognized and supported by 
the producers of Scream in the 
Dark. 

Working under pressures · of 
time and preparation, this year's 
Scream in the Dark is a definite 
success. Martin sees this as even 
more encouragement, as the stu-
dents had less than a week to con-
struct the actual set. 

The production was planned to 
be held in EI Cajon for the first 
time in seven years. This plan 
worked out very nicely, except for 
the fact that there was no suitable 
building there. This problem was 
not resolved until Oct. 19, three 
days before ol'.Cning night: 

After 25 years , Scream in the 
Dark has become a tradition for 
many and Martin claims that 
when parents see the name and 
remember when they screamed in 
the dark, they can't wait to take 
their kids and friends back for 
more. 

The haunted house is accompa-
nied by a complete carnival which 
is the only aspect of the project 
that is not manned, carried out or 
constructed by high school stu-
dents.

Cover-Up 
On Campus 
Continued from pale 8 
of the Vietnam war. In addition, 
money from the South-East Asian 
heroin trade augmented this stock-
pile. 

The team's services are reported 
to have been employed by such 
notables as the Shah of Iran and 
Anastasio Somoza. However, the 
movie reports that the fall of these 
leaders, and the extensive Con-
gressional review of covert activi-
ties in the late 70s forced the team 
of men into private enterprise. 

They formed the Egyptian Air 
Transport Services Corporation 
(EA TSCO) which has played a 
principle role in the Contra supply 
efforts. EA TSCO is accused of 
transporting cocaine back into 
this country. Hassenfus was flying 
an EA TSCO plane when he was 
shot down over Nicaragua. 

Whatever role Bush may have 
played in these operations as head 
of the CIA is uncertain. However, 
drug shipments into this country 
and arms shipments to nations 
accused of supporting terrorism 
have soared during his tenure as 
Chairman of the Presidential Task 
Force against drugs and terrorism. 

Bush allegedly met with Gor-
banifar and Iranian representa-
tives to postpone the hostage re-
lease in October, 1980. Along 
with millions ()f dollars, the movie 
reports that the Iranian represen-
tatives received assurances that 
arms would be sent to them through-
out Reagan's term as president. 

Much of the information used 
in this film was collected by two 
sources: Barbara Honneggar, a 
former Reagan Administration 
policy analyst, and Dan Sheehan 
of the Christic Institute. 

The Christie Institute is pre-
senting the evidence used for the 
movie in Federal Court. The case 
was thrown out of court in 
Florida, but is currently being 
appealed, which fuels some skepti-
cism about the movie's validity. 

Another problem with the 
documentary is its reliance on 
interviews with convicted drug 
smugglers who claim to have 
struck deals with the CIA, but for 
some reason are still incarcerated. 

The film will be presented by 
the Committee for World Demo-
cracy free of charge on Friday, in

Pyrrhic Victory Over Claremont-Mudd 
Goalie Brian Siljander Suffers Season-Ending Injury to Shoulder in Win 
By DANA CHAIKEN 
Contributing Writer 

UCS D's men's soccer team left 
the field after last Monday's game 
against Claremont-Mudd with 
two important victories a nd a 
devas tating loss. 

The fi rst victory came in the 
form of a 1-0 victory over the 
visiting Stags (12-3-1 and ranked 
futh in the region) which upped 
the Tritons ' record to 15-0-2. The 
second, although not assured, is 
the right to host the Division III 
Western Regionals November 4-6. 

The loss is one that does not 
directly affect UCSD's undefeated 
record, but might in the future. 
The game could be considered a 
pyrrhic victory of orts, for with 
9:31 left in the game, goalie Brian 
Siljander suffered a season ending 

injury to hi left shoulder. 
"The biggest game of the year," 

a labeled by UCS D head coach 
Derek Armstrong, who celebrated 
his lOOth victory with a short pre-
game ceremony, turned out to be 
both an extremely physical and 
emotional occasion. 

With 16: 15 left in the fi rst half, 
the referee yellow carded a U CSD 
player and nine seconds later 
flashed another to one of the 
Stags for pushing, which was not 
an uncommon call by the man in 
black. This seemed to fire up the 
Tritons as they scored the game's 
only goal less than two minutes 
later on a switch-field maneuver. 

Mike Bradley sent the ball from 
left midfield down to substitute 
forward Thein Nguyen in front of 
the goal, who described what 
happened next. "I received the 
ball. I saw there were two players

behind me. so I was committed to 
score. I beat them both, and shot." 

Armstrong merely called it "an 
absolutely brilliant goal." 

The Tritons seemed to dominate 
the rest of the game, though they 
.didn't manage to find the net. 
Nguyen and team co-captain Scott 
Rommel both failed to capitalize 
on breakaways, but one goal 
proved enough as UCSD's defense 
gave the Stags minimal scoring 
opportunities. 

The last of the few times the 
Triton defense, which was without 
injured sweeper Craig Gross, 
allowed Claremont-Mudd into 
its territory, it proved costly. 
Goalie Siljander came out and 
made a beautiful diving bloclc 
save, but felt the impact of a 
Claremont-Mudd player in the 
process. 

The Stag who roughed up the 
keeper received only a warning 
instead of a yellow card. A dis-

believing Armstrong pointed out 
after the game that the Claremont-
Mudd player "had no chance of 
gettinJ( that ball." 

Assistant Athletic Trainer Brian 
McDonald , who attended to 
Siljander, estimated that the op-
posing player was not directly 
responsible. "Brian feU on his left 
shoulder. The ground forced the 
injury, but the contact put him in 
the position to be injured," he 
elaborated. 

Armstrong was furious about 
the turn of events. as he thought 
the "diaboIic" referee "should have 
pulled them back." 

Women's head soccer coach 
Orian McManus explained this 
notion further: "The referees didn't 
read the hanging tackles - the 
kind that are deliberate and could 
break somebody's leg. The referee 
must catch or they'll [Clare-
mont] continue to do it. There 
were no warnings from the re-
feree." 

Nguyen, commenting on the 
game's roughness factor, assessed 
that "It was overly rough towards 
the end ofthe second half. That's 
why Coach is so mad thafOrian is 
hurt. " 

Siljander, who has had 13 shu-
touts in 17 games, and whom 
Armstrong insists is "the best 
goalie in the United States with-
out question," was replaced in the 
game by c<H:aptain Bradley. 

Armstrong had until yesterday's

Soccer PHILS PRIME PICKS 
Continued from pale 11 
game with the Master's College to 
work out his goalie situation. "I 
do have another goalie, but 1 
want to save his redshirt year. J'm 
gonna put a call out for Greg 
Stadler and hope to get him back," 
he speculated.

Stadler started for last year's 
team, and was a member of this 
year's squad before quitting a fe~ 
games into the season. It IS 
believed that he will return, but 
that is still unconfirmed. 

(Editor's note: Stadler played 
in yesterday's game against The 
Master's Col/ege). 

The Tritons' chances of hosting 
improved yesterday when they 
recorded another shutout, this 
time in the form of a 2-0 win over 
The Master's College. Both goals 
were scored in the second half. 

UCSD's 2-0 lead at halftime 
led to a very physical second half 
- a physical battle the Master's 
College was not able to win, as it 
was assessed 17 fouls in a losing 
effort. 

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... I know this is a pretty big 
spread for UCLA to have over a team that boa~ts the 
No.1 offense in the nation, but so what? WashlOgton 
St.'s defense isn't that good, and UCLA's offense and 
defense are very good (the Bruins are., aft~r all, the No. 
1 team in the country). Aikman Will pick apart the 
Cougar defense with his aerial atta.c~, and in front of 
its home fans UCLA could turn thiS lOto a holocaust.

Soccer 
Continued from pale 13 

The Tritons ' sterling play has 
not gone unnoticed - an amaz-
ing 500 plus fans turned out to 
watch Monday's game and recent 
polls have UCSD ranked fourth 
in the country. 

The team now travels north to 
play Menlo and UC Santa Cruz 

on its road to the playoffs and, 
hopefully, an undefeated season. 

On the actual playoff compe-
tition , Claremont-Mudd head 
coach Steve Davis complimented 
the natiol'ally founh-ranked Tri-
tons, conceding, " UCSD is the 
best team in the district . My hat is 
off to t hem," and predicted , 
"They're going to the regionals 
and are going to cause a lot of 
trouble in the national tourna-
ment. "

Playoff Picture 
Looks Bleak 
For Water Polo 

By RICK HAZELTINE 
Los Angeles Times 

The UC San Diego water polo 
team appears to have little chance 
of becoming the first Division III 
team to make the National Colle-
giate Athletic Assn. championship 
tournament after a 12-7 loss to 
sixth-ranked UC Irvine Friday. 

The Tritons (15-10) are ranked 
eighth in the country. Even if they 
stay among the top eight, it is 
unlikely they will make the eight-
team championships even though 
they are the only Division III 
team in the rankings. Because 
there are not enough non-Division 
I teams, there is only one NCAA 
championship tournament for all 
divisions. 

The Tritons probably need to 
finish in the top six to have a 
chance because the East region 
has two automatic qualifiers to 
the NCAA tournament. which 
will probably be 10th-ranked 
Brown and possibly unranked 
Navy. 

"It's been one of 
those years where 
we cannot for the life 
of us beat anyone 
ahead of us [in the 
polls ]." 

-Denny Harper 
Head Coach 

UCSD is hoping .nat it will 
have a chance next year if the 
NCAA grants the Western Water 
Polo Assn. an automatic qualifier 
to the NCAA tournament. 

UCSD has participated in the 
Western association since it was 
formed in 1982. It consists of 
indepc:Rdent schools and each year 
holds a season-ending tourna-
ment. UCSD will be the top-
seeded team this year and has 
reached every final since the 
tournament started, winning in 
1983 and 1985. 

"It's been one of those years 
where we cannot for the life of us 
beat anyone ahead of us [in the 
polIs]. "Coach Denny Harper said. 
"But we haven't lost to anyone 
behind us, either." 

The WWP A tournament will 
be at Air Force Nov. 11-13 and 
will feature Loyola-Chicago, 
Santa Clara. Chaminade. Cal 
State Los Angeles and Utah.

tennis played this past weekend on 
the MUir Couna, and when the last 
winning forehand had been hit, two 
new men 's champions had been 
crowned In the UCSD All-Campus 
TenniS Championships. 

Jen Ray cruised the Open bracket 
pre"y much how he wanted to, His 
6-2, 6-3 win over David Ka iden was 
perhaps his toughesl match. Both 
he and Ka iden were tested in pre-
vious matches, Ray deteated John 
Moon in the semis 10 Ray 6-1 . 6-1 . 
Kaiden struggled in a set with third 
place linisher Alan Yap.

Among other things: Big sandstone blOCks that look like hay bales from a distance. a sculpture 
garden with strong referential connections to the Druids a ancient England. a purple chain link fence 
on stilts. and a wall full a 24 sixteen-Inch color television sets simultaneously hooked up to MTV and a 
computerized visual-Image processor. Plus. of course. a brightly colored 14-foot tall fiberglass 
sculpture representing. perhaps. what a chicken would look like toa farmhand who picked and ate 
a f6W too many of the wrong mushrooms on the way home through the woods. 

These things are the cutting edge of Art with a capital A BIg-time concl3ptuallsm Is at work amidst 
the Mad concrete towers of UCSD. under the sponsorship of the Stuart Foundation and the University's 
own department of visual arts. 

The Stuart Collection began In 1982 when James Stuart DeSilva. tuna magnate and patron of the 
arts. forged a noble and high-minded agreement with the University, UCSD would provide space for 
Installation ofa collection of public art works. and DeSllva's Stuart foundation would supply the seed 
money needed to start the collection. Additional funding for the project was to be (and still is) 
provided by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), 

Those" 'ho clamor about the use of University funds and revenue from tuition to create a sculpture 
collection ( and not. perhaps. spent on a football team or outdoor alT)pitheatre) are herewith refuted. 
The visual arts department pays only for the operation of the Stuart Collection office In Mandeville 
Center. All funds for Installation. construction. and upkeep of new works In the Collection come from 
the NEA the Stuart Foundation. or other Independent financial sources not necessarily associated 
with the University. UCSD does not "buy" pieces for the Collection, 

The Stuart Foundation Advisory CommIttee. an International body of art scholars and museum 
directors. Invites artists of reknown to submit proposals tor Installations. These proposals are reviewed 
for artistic merit by the Committee and for safety and appropriateness by the Chancellor and other 
University officials. The Chancellor has final veto power CNer any Intended project. ArtIsts are paid 
S5.CXXl for the Initial proposal. Construction and Installation costs run from $10.000 to $70.000 and up. 
depending on the scale and nature a the work. 

All a the pieces In the Stuart Collection deal with the notion of architecturally ortented art as 
functional. entertaining orthought-provoldng ratherthan merely monumental. The works are Intend-
ed to fill a contextual need. They are not In the same category as traditional. static public art. The 
projects are not meant to be harmonious to the f¥tI8 or stralghtfofwardly representational. It Is better to 
think of them as "mysterious architecture." a "slap In the face" to today's microwave oven. Instant-
gratification culture. 

According to Mary Beebe. stuart Collection director. slated next for the Collection Is a work by 
Jenny Holzer. an artist who recently Installed an LE.D. billboard near Hlgh'lJOY 101 In San Francisco's 
South-of-Market district, Holzer will be designing a set a benches and tables to be placed near Muir 
Commons. with temporary accompanying video pieces.

Seven Artistic 
Wonders 

byJlm gary 
hIatuS wrtter 

, n addition to the soon-to-b&-Inougurated 'Vices 
and Virtues," the Stuart Collection contains seven 

works by various artists from around the world. 
Proposals for more are always being considered. 
These marvelous examples of post·modernlst Inf"Kr 
vatlon Include: 

The Sun God by Nlkl de Saint Phalle: This Is the big fiberglass bird which has come to be regarded 
as the unofficial mascot of UCSD, It was the first 
work commissioned in the Collection and was 
Installed on Feb. 1, 1983. The sculpture Is Intended 
to evoke a wide range of reactions from Its 
viewers. Although no one can dispute Its ability to 
attract attention. the project Is not unique to the 
UniverSity; its sculptor installed a similar status in 
the fountain of the Centre Pompldou in Paris. 
More than one UCSD student has been surprised 
when visiting France to find that the French also 
have a large fiberglass bird. The one In Paris squirts 
water. though, 

La Jolla Project by Richard RelsChner. (Known commonly as Stonehenge.) In 1984, seventy-
one blocks of marble were brought from New 
England to La Jolla and arranged on the lawn 
south a the Humanities library. At least a dozen 
students have testified to having hod sex on the 
large. altarllke structure here under a full moon. 
This Installation suffers on a human scole, however, 
from a lack a Intimacy. The blocks are too 
Isolated, too spread out. and the ground always 
seems to be wet, A more accessible, more formal 
arrangement of the stones would have improved 
both the visual Impression and the comfortable-
ness a the site. 

Robert Irwln's untitled work: also knawn as the Fence In The Trees. The Koala Catchers. and 
the BIg Blue (or Purple) Volleyball Net. This piece 
resides In the Enchanted Forest near Central 
library. with Its friends the Talking Trees and the 
Sun God. The "fence" Is Intended as a visual pun

Stuart 
Continued from pqe 1 
relating to the grid planting of the 
eucalyptuS trees in the area and 
also calls the viewer's attention to 
the interplay of the sunlight and 
the trees. When originally in-
stalled in April 1983, the struc-
ture was painted purple: months 
of exposure to the elements bleach-
ed it light blue. 

U ntitled works by Terry Allen: Uke the Fences, these works 
have no designated title. In early 
1986, three eucalyptus trees grow-
ing in the way of campus con-
struction were cut down, coated 
with lead sheeting and wired for 
sound. The trees were then taken 
to the forest near the fences and 
re-erected_ The west tree (nearer 
Mandeville Center) playa music; 
the east tree recites poems and 
stories. Both trees' tapes are cross--
cultural melanges of material con-
tributed by various artists, musi-
cians, and poets. David Byrne, 
among other people, is currently 
at work on future tapes for the 
trees. There is also a third, mute 
tree near Central Library. 

U nda by Ian Hamilton Finlay: UNDA was installed in 1987, 
by the soccer field near the Third 
Apartments. There are five big 
limestone blocks with the letters 
UNDA chiseled into them. 
UNDA means 'wave' in Latin. 
The blocks look like hay bales 
from a distance. There is also the 
editor's mark for "trarupoee these 
letters" on the bloc~s. The letters 

~ ~ , (' ,r' • ( 
) j I t1 I H t .~ • ~1 • I ~ r I I I , , , 

are transposed on the different 
blocks, so they read UNDA 
UNAD DANU NADU ADNU. 
This is a useful project. If some-
body kicks a ball out of bounds 
while playing soccer here, the 
blocks will probably stop it from 
rolling onto one of the Third 
Apartments porches and breaking 
a flowerpot. UNDA is not, how-
ever, what most folks consider 
compelling art. 

Something Pacific by Nam June Paik: This work consists of 
two parts; a number of antique 
TV sets juxtaposed with minia-
ture copies of famous statues, 
(placed near the Media Center), 
and a bank of TV sets wired 
through a computerized image 
processor with a control panel so 
the viewer can actively manipulate 
the images. The statues are an 
amusing comment on the ubiq-
uity of television in modern s0-
ciety, and the wall of TVs is a lot 
of fun to play with. "Something 
Pacific" is unique in the Collec-
tion in that it is playful, direct and 
interactive rather than fixed and 
contextual. 

La Jolla Vista View by William Wegman: This scenic overlook 
is on the southern edge of campus, 
near the Mandell Weiss Center. 
Center. Current plans call for the 
drive near the work to be relo-
cated to the south, so that in the 
future the "Vista View" will be 
adjacent to the road. A telescope 
and water fountain are installed 
here, along with a decorative wall . 
and Wegman's etching ofthe pan-
oramic La Jolla townscape. With 
the telescope, the careful viewer 
can not only see the globular clus-
ters in Sagittarius but also read the 
marquee at the La Jolla Village 
Plaza Theater.

Maniacal Music 
10,000 Times Over 

by lucha opru 
hiaNa writer 

W hat's the matter here? Well, not much if you 
are yearning for some 

intriguing, compelling music this 
weekend. 10,000 Maniacs will 
perform at the California Theater 
this Saturday at 8 p.m. 

Even with two major label al-
bums, extensive performing exper-
ience, and tons of complimentary 
press notices, this New York State 
quintet seems strangely untouched 
by the cynicism and vulgarity that 
is often associated with the music 
business. 

Ultimately an engaging dance 
band, the Maniacs draw inspir-
ation from British and American 
folk, Caribbean lilt, African high-
life, and new wave experiment-
alism. To label their sound as uni-
que is an injustice. Their light, 
scratchy songs convey thoughtful 
reflections of the world they see. 

Originally a six member hand, 
the Maniacs began playing to-
gether in 1981, specializing in 
covers of material by English 
bands such as Joy Division and 

Gang of Four, and reggae groups 
like the Mighty Diamonds. Back 
then the band consisted of vocalist 
Natalie Merchant, guitarist Robert 
Buck, bassist Steven Gustafson, 
keyboardist Dennis Drew, drum-
mer Jerome Augustyniak, and gui-
tarist/bassist John Lombardo. 

In 1986, John Lombardo left 
the band. "He just got tired and 
quit," Natalie Merchant said . 
"John was like our-older brother, 
our musical dad. After he left. we 
were really on our own, and I 
think that that helped everyone's 
musical personalities develop 
more. Now we have more confi-
dence in each other's musical 
decisions. and more confidence in 
ourselves. And once we learned to 
play with four instruments instead 
of five, we got tighter as a band. 
and our musical ideas got clearer 
and stronger," Drew added. 

With the departUre of John 
Lombardo, the remaining quintet 
was forced to rise to the occasion 
and And new musical strengths, 
by developing their songwriting 
talents. 

From the outset, 10,000 Mani-
acs have epitomized the working-
band. After a year of playing clubs 
and benefits throughout western 
New York, the band recorded a ' 
five-song EP, Human Conflict 
Number Five, on their own label. 

Next they bought an old school 
bus and began a touring marathon 
throughout the eastern U.S. and 
in Ontario, Canada. They were 
very well received in the Athens, 
GA-based New Wave South, 
which would become their second 
home. 

In 1983, they releaSed their 10-
song album entitled Secrets of the 1 
Ching, which drew high critical 
praise, particularly in England. 
Taking this cue, the Maniacs 
toured extensively in the U.K., 
Holland, and Germany in 198+85. 

Also at this time, the band 
recorded The Wishing ChaiT in 
London with producer Joe Boyd, 
a former mentor to Fairport Con-
vention, a key Maniacs influence. 
The album, which included tracks 
such as "Can't Ignore the Train," 
"Scorpio Rising," and a remake of 
"My Mother the War," ended up 
as one of 1985's most critically 
acclaimed releases. 

10,000 Maniacs' second Elek-
tra album, In My T Tibe, has a new 
sound to it, probably due to the 
lack of John Lombardo and the 
presence of a big name producer. 
Peter Asher. The band has taken 
the achievements of The Wishing 
Chair in a different direction, this 
time coming to terms with mod-
ern production techniques. 

Nal:alie Merchant's vocals and 
lyrics are solidly out front this 
time, making the personal con-

frontations of "What's the Matter 
Here?" and "Gun Shy" and the 
vivid scene-setting of "The Paint-
ed Desert" and "City of Angels" 
extremely e~ective. 

"I think this is the album that 
we've been trying to make for a 
long time," says Natalie. "I want 
people to hear our records," she 
says, "and that'S why we worked 
so hard to communicate on this 
album. It would be very nice if the 
album gets a lot of radio play, for a 
lot of reasons, but I can't weigh 
my value as a human being on 
that. I think we're more interested 
in moving units." The album is a 
phenomenal success, putting the 
Maniacs in boldface on the music-
al map. 

The music of 10,000 Maniacs is 
upbeat and very listenable, but at 
times almost disturbing in its "real-

ness." The songs are usually sub-
tle, carefully composed, but not at 
all maniacal. Merchant writes ~r­
iously about the human condi-
tion, addressing general artistic 
and political concerns (surrealism, 
atomic war) or conveying the suf-
fering of unknown individuals (the 
elderly, the working poor, the 
abused). The combination is a 
sort of celebration of humanity 
through the cross-cultural mark-
ers of musical genres 

The live show is . low-key but 
riveting, controlled, almost hyp-
notic. Merchant's voice and move-
ments are natural and charismatic, 
Buc.k's guitar expertise dazzling. 
This band does nOt insult the 
intelligence of listener's as so many 
popular bands today. Though 
armed with a message, these 
Maniacs do not come to preach.

Not everyone is cut out to change 
the world. After all, it takes educa-
tion, skills and a spare two years. 
Also a willingness to work. Hard. 
This year 3,750 Americans will join 
the Peace Corps to do just that. 
They'll do things like build roads, 
plant forests and crops, teach 
English, develop small businesses, 
train community health workers, 
or even coach basketball. However; 
what they'll be doing isn't half as 
important as the fact that they'll be 
changing a little piece of the world 
... for the better. 
And when they return, these 
3,750 Americans will find that 
experience doing hard work will 
have another benefit. It's exactly 
what their next employers are 
looking for. 
So, give the Peace Corps your next 
two years, And while you're out 
changing the world, you'll also be 
making a place in it for yourself .

Impressionistic 
Van Gogh 

by arthur aah 
hiatw writer 

Vincent: The Life and Death of 
Vincent Van GJgh opened at the 
Ken Cinema Oct. 21 and runs 
until Saturday, Oct. 29, In struc-
ture the film is a combination of 
documentary and reenacttnent for-
mats. In content it is a unique and 
marvelous look into the mind and 
heart of one of modern art's most 
brilliant pioneers. 

The entire text of the film is 
tale en from Van Gogh's letters to 
his brother Theo, as well as a few 
to the French painter Gauguin. 
Meanwhile, images of events from 
Van Gogh's intense life fill the 
screen. 

From this combination, direc-
tor Paul Cox could have assembled 
a standard documentary, reminis-
cent of Sunday afternoons spent 
watching public television. What 
he achieved, however, is startling, 

lnstead of presenting Van 
Gogh's surroundings as a simple 

bacledrop to his words, Cox chose 
a more impressionistic approach, 
paralleling Van Gogh's own uni-
que perspective. The director lives 
and works in Australia but he was 
raised in the Netherlands and thus 
feels a kinship to Van Gogh that is 
reflected in his lifeiollB interest in 
the work of the painter. 

Vincent was created in cooper-
ation with museums in the Nether-
lands, France, and the Soviet 
Union as a tribute to Van Gogh, as 
the centenary of his death ap-
proaches in 1990. 

The most compelling a!lpect of 
this film was its intense subjecti"ir,. 
The sounds and sights that sur-
rounded Van Gogh are presented 
through his own intense presence. 
His favorite landscapes and build-
ings, as well as the few people that 
surrounded him are presented 
through the camera as if through 
his own eyes. The spoken text 
provides insight into the creative 
and personal aspirations that went 
into the creation of his some 1800 
pictures, of which only one was 
sold during his lifetime. The entire 
mood of the film is very internal, 
as if the viewer is looking from 
inside Van Gogh's mind to find 
the images on the screen. (The 
clOSing credits include, Word.! : 

Vincent Van GJgh.) 
Just as importantly, Cox suc-

ceeds in avoiding the picture of 
Van Gogh as a wild man full of 
self-directed violent passions and 
uncontrolable urges. lnstead Cox 
highlights the artist's profound 
humanity and unique creative 
vision. The viewer feels the intense 
dedication and commitment to 
service of this young evangelical 
student transferred into the world 
of art. 

To his brother he wrote, "The 
only thing 1 want to do is to give 
peace to poor creatures, and rec-
oncile them to their existence here 
on earth." And later, "¥y greatest 

desire is to make beautiful things. 
But making beautiful things costs 
trouble, and disappointment and 
perseverence ... and 1 don't want 
that beaury to come from the 
material, but from within myself." 

The fit of insanity that caused 
Van Gogh to mutilate his ear and 
send it to his lover is never menti-
oned directly in the film . Rather 
the viewer sees an impressionistic 
recreation of the reaction that the 
painter experienced at her door-
step, with no spoleen words except 
the letter that he wrote to his 
brother afterwords.

by sunanda kumar sanyal 
rontributinl writer 

"Sculpture," according to Michel-
angelo, "is the extraction of the 
forms hidden in an apparently 
shapeless block by eliminating the 
superfluous portions." 

In the case of the Okeanos, a 
new sculpture at the Scripps Insti-
rute, the sculptor, William Tuc-
ker, seemed to have wanted this 
job to be partly done by the 
viewer. It is the duty of the viewer 
to excavate the underlying forms 
from the thirteen foot high bronze 
piece with apparently no identity 
at all. 

Although this exploration is 
entirely through vision, and largely 
dependent on the conceptual and 
intellectual basis of the viewers 
themselves, one can ill afford to 
ignore the fact that any pedestrian 
could be rooted to the ground at 
the very first glance at this in-
stallation, at least for the moment. 

The reasons behind this are: 
firs.t, the queer structure and comp-
ositional formation of the piece 
reveals an immensely powerful 
tension and balance, which can be 
felt from every angle. This sense is 
at its highest when viewing the 
sculpture from the front. Every 
moment it seems to be falling 

down, yet it remains in place with 
an ironically rigid balance. Second-
ly, the stooping monumentality of 
the piece casts a weird sensation 
over the viewer, who cannot help 
glancing at it once again. The mas-
siveness is unfathomable. 

As far as the unveiling of the 
inert forms are concerned, Tucker 
leaves them such an enigma that it 
becomes a game on behalf of the 
viewer to try to locate the shapes 
that might dormant in it. Does it 
seem to be the head of a giant 

UCSD NATIONAL ISSUES FORUM 

The coarse texture and the large 
dents on the surface add a sense of 
primitiveness to the work, which 
helps one to identify it as a part of 
nature. At the same time the dents 
provide mysterious ups and downs 
along the surface, the bursting 
energy and the grave massiveness 
adding to its mysticism. 

Tucker has payed his homage 
to Rodin in capturing the monu-
mentality of form with a bursting 
energy and creating a coarse sur-
face quite contrary to the typical 
theory of beauty. It is indeed a 
significant contribution to 20th 
century sculpture and the Scripps 
clinic is surely to be admired for 
commisSioning and preserving it.

THE MURDERERS AMONG Us 
n May 5th, 1945-after four and 
a half years of internment in a 
series of Nazi death camps, 
Simon Wiesen thaI lay in a bunk, 
too weak to meet his liberators. 
He was 37 years old, six feet tall, 
and weighed 90 pounds. 

Today, at age 76, Wie-
senthal is internationally

Continued from pqe 1 

Holzer uses simple, direct con-
struction methods and connota-
t ive phrases to induce the viewer 
to read a written message. The use 
of electronic billboards and words 
carved in stone are some of her 
attention-getting techniques. She 
is one of America's foremost 
avant gar-de artists, and her style 
fits perfectly with the tone of the 
Collection. 

The most recent addition is 
"Vices and Vi~es" by Bruce 
Nauman. Although the work will 
not be formally inaugurated until 
Oct. 28, it has been running for 
over a month already. 

"Vices and Virtues" consists of 
seven-foot high neon word pairs 
which flash on and off around the 
outside perimeter of the Structur-
al Systems Laboratory. There are 
seven such pairs: Faith-Lust, 
Hope-Envy,Owity-Sloth, ~ 
Pride, Justice-Avarice, Temperance-
Gluttony, and Fortitude-Anger. 

The 88 letters required a full 
mile of neon tubing and a large 
electrical transformer for each let-
ter. The "vice words" are formed 
of italic (slanted) letters and are 
superimposed over the "vinue 
words." (It might afso be interest-
ing to know that the "virtues" 
flash sequentially clockwise 
around the building at three 
seconds per word, and the "vices" 
go counter-clockwise at 2.5 
seconds per word.) 

Bruce Nauman is an interna-
tionally known artist who received 
his M.F.A. from UC Davis in 
1966. Much of his early work waa 
gestural sculpture: fiberglass, wax, 
and neon representations of the 
human body, often his own. 
Through the '70s, he produced 
works of a larger acale, often 
related to technolOlY and disguise. 

Nauman ~ steel, neon, cor-
ridors and tuonels u elements in 
hls art. HiI pieces arc hard-edged 
and compellina - 4e8nitely "m~ 
terious lfChitectute." 

Nauman got the idea for the 
installation on a visit to UCSD 
several years ago, when he was 
asked by the Stuart Committee to 
produce a proposal for the Collec-
tion. In the course of a conver-
sation with Beebe, sOmeone hap-
pened to mention the Seven 
Deadly Sins. This casual comment 
inspired Nauman to design "Vices 
and Virtues," although he intend-
ed it originally for the Mandell 
Weiss Center, near the Humani-
ties Ubrary. The site was changed 
when Torrey Pines residents 
proved none too excited about a 
big flashing neon sign in their 
neighborhood. "It's much more 
exciting where it is now," Beebe 
said. "There's less light and the 
scale is much more dramatic on 
the Structural Laboratory." 

Indeed. The permutations of 14 
different colors of neon and their 
placement on the glass-sided 
building combine to make " Vices 
and Virtues" a compelling work 
of art. Whether or not the words 
Temperance, Avarice and Lust 
evoke an emotional reaction, it is 
easy to be fascinated by the visual 
spectacle of the project . Beebe 
said, "We expect it to create lots 
of discussion on many levels, 
which is just what art is supposed 
to do." 

"Vices and Virtues" will have 
its inauguration on Oct. 28, with a 
reception at 5 :30 p.m. at the 
Charles Lee Powell Structural 
Systems Laboratory, east of the 
bookstore and University Center 
The reception is free and open to 
the public. The project will be 
illuminated from dusk until 11 
p.m. nightly thereafter.
