Admissions policy passes 
C omprehensive review to weigh life experiences 
By MARGARET O' NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UC Board Regents 
voted Nov. 15 to p' : ~ new 
admissions policy, comprehen-
si ve review, in pace for under-
graduates at all UC campuses 

The policy, which was 
approved 15 to 4 by the regents, 
is designed to allow applicants to 
be considered on a broad basis of 
academic and personal qualifica-
tions. . 

Their applications are due 
Nov.30. 

The new admissions sran-
dards have come under fire by 
opponents, who cite the close 
proximity to the Nov. 30 dead-
line. 

The measure was proposed by 
the Academic Senate, which rep-
resents faculty from all the UC 
campuses.

mic rigor," Johnson told the L:C 
Berkeley Datly Califonllull 
"Comprehensivc rCI'ic\\ gwcs 
rise to doubt and wnfmion . It I, 
overly ambiguous." 

She said he belicvc~ compre-
hensive review is not Ob)CClII'e 
and will confuse applicants. 

Lee also expressed his skepn -
cism about the process. 

lyon Uew/Cuordion 
Playinc House: T'MJ-year old Selena, a young resident of St Vincent de Paul's 
Homeless Sheleter, breaks from her recreation on the shelter's playground. 

Comprehensive review will 
replace the old two-tier system of 
admissions, established by the 
SP-1 legislation, which required 
campuses to admit 50 to 75 per-
cent of their applicants on acade-
mic factors alone. 

The new policy, which 
requires more intensive evalua-
tions of appltcatlons, will ta ke 
effect for students applymg for 
admission to the fall 2002 tenn. 

"We believe th.is policy sends 
a strong signal that UC is look-
ing for students who have 
achieved at high levels and, III 
doing so, have challenged them-
selves to the grea test extent pos-
sible," said UC President 
Richard C. Atkilison in a state-
ment. 

Regents John DaVIes, S. Sue 
Johnson, David S. Lee and John 
J. Moores voted against compre-
hensive review. 

"If we only spend 20 mInute, 
looking at an applic.ltion. 1 dOll 't 
believe that is enough tlmc to 
really get to know ; studcl1I ." 
Lee told the UCSlJ Dutly .\ ams.

Youth Vote' ready . 
to 'sign up Tritons 
ASUCSD teams with CalPIRG to 
increase campus voter registration 
By REBECCA WOOD 
Senior Staff Writer 

To drum up support for 
Youth Vote, a nationwide cam-
paign to increase student voter 
tu rnout, members of CalPIRG 
and the A.S. Council are plan-
ning a trip to San Diego City 
lIall. 

A.S. President Jeff Dodge, 
Vice President Internal Jenn 
Brown and CalPIRG Chair 
Matt McFeeiey will ask the San 
Diego City Council to sign the 
Youth Vote Statement of 
PrinCiples Tuesday. 

Youth Vote is a national 
coalition of organizations 
formed to encourage students to 
vote. 

This year's efforts at UCSD 
involve gaining administration 
an.d faculty support. A.S. Vice 
President External Dylan De 
Kervor said she is going to ask 
the chancellor and vice chancel-
lor to ask them to sign the state-
ment. 

The Statement of Principles 
contains four, items including a 
student-sponsored, televised 
gubernatorial debate in which 
students may write and ask 
questions of the candidates. The 
statement also calls for sam .. 
day voter registration in 
California, which, if passed, 
would allow California residents 
to register and vote on election 
day at their nearest poll. 
Currently, Minnesota uses such 
a system. 

The third item includes thor-
.ough implementation of the 

1998 Federal Higher Education 
Act, which requires publicly 
funded colleges and universities 
to make a "good faith effort" to 
supply incoming students with 
voter registration forms . 

State Board member and 
Youth Vote Coordinator Chris 
Noddings suggested that this 
might include putting a feature 
on Studentlink that would 
enable students to register to 
vote, or putting voter registra-
tion booklets in the UCSD 
Bookstore. 

The fourth item encourages 
universities t d more to offer 
hands-on civic experience and 
participation opportunities. 

"We are working to get the 
political process to work for 
[students), to get politicians to 
address issues students are con-
cerned about," McFeeley said 

De Kervor said the goal is to 
get 200 people to sign the 
Statement of Principles. 

"I can't see why people would 
not support it," she said. 

In last year's presidential 
election, only one in five stu-
dents age 18 to 24 voted. Of the 
300 million potential voters, this 
age group comprises 50 million 
voters. 

De Kervor explained the sig-
nificance of the student voting 
bloc. 

"As long as we are the future 
of this country and we do not 
fulfill our capacity in the institu-
tion of voting, we will not be 
represented." She said that the

UCSD helps with science fair 
Preuss' School students participate in the activity 
By CARLAN WENDLER 
Senior Staff Writer 

At 8:30 a.m. on Nov. 17, 30 
UCSD students trekked to The 
Preuss School to help middle and 
high school students with their sci-
ence fair projects. 

This event, coordinated by 
UCSD undergraduate students and 
Preuss School teachers, is part of a 
series of sessions intended to give 
ixth- through lOth-grade students 

more individual attention and guid-
ance on their science projects. 
Projects ranged from determining 
the effects of nitrate and phosphate 
concentration on algae growth to 
the comparative advantage of wing 
area and shape in model airplanes. 

"I haven't done experunents [like 
thi;] since elementary schoo, ,0 It'S 
refreshing my memory and it's real-
ly exciting." said UCSD sophomore 
Emily Wear. 

Though still acquiring basic lab-
oratory equipment such as micro-
scopes, The Preuss School has par-
ticipated in this science fair since its 
inception three years ago. The 
Preuss School offers its students a 
rigorous, college perpatory curricu-
lum. Students' experiments must be 
well -planned and deal with a rela-

Car chase 
ends at 
Warren 
campus 
N onaffiliates 
arrested on 
assault charges 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

A car chase ended at Warren col-
lege With the arrest of two young adult 
nonaffiliates on Thursday evening JUSt 
after 10 p.m., according to police 
repons. 

ineteen-year-old Eric Bradford 
and 21-year-old Kevin Burch were 
arrested and charged with assault 
with a deadly weapon. Bradford was 
also booked on charges of driving 
under the influence of alcohol and 
attempting to avoid police. 

\OVarren residents who witnessed 
the chase said they saw the men drive 
their white Toyota Supra OntO a path-
way just southwest of Earl's Place. 
Then they said the men exited the car 
and proceeded to run until appreheod-
cd by police officers. 

Both men were transported to 
Central Jail. 

Admissions: 
New poliex to affect fall 
2002 applicants 
Continued f rom page 1 

"Academic performance is at the 
heart of the admissions process, and 
that fact will not change,fl stated 
Chand R. Viswanathan, chair of the 
systemwide Academic Council. "We 
believe that a full review of the qualifi-
cations an applicant presents is truly 
our best means of admitting a high-
achieving, highly motivated freshman 
class each year." 

A group of UCSD staff and faculty 
developed a plan follo\ving the guide-
It nc!> of comprehensive review for 
undergraduate admi sions. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Adam Meyers said the new policy is 
not going to be beneficial to the cam-
pus. 

"Comprehensive review i just as 
arbi trary as usi ng raw scores," 
Meyers said. "It doesn't reflect on 
anybody's abi lity. At least with scores, 
everybody is on an equal playing 
field ." 

The A.S. Council has taken a stance 
in favor of comprehensive review. 

"\\'e are excited about the passing 
of comprehensive review because it is 
one step toward acknowledging the 
inequalities of California schools and 
accepting qualified students who 
might not otherwise be accepted," said 
A.S. Vice President Internal Jenn 
Brown. 

Critics statewide have called com-
prehensive review a policy of "back-
door affirmative action." Meyers said 
he feels that this is one of the regents' 
aims with the program. 

"They're totally trying to skirt 
their inability to recruit minorities," 
,\1 eyers said . 

Brown said she believes the policy 
will bring the most qualified students 
to UCSD. 

"We're finall y going to be accept-
Ing students on who they are and what 
they can bring to UCSD, instead of 
JUSt their grades and S.A.T. scores," 
she said. 

The A.S. Council passed legislation 
supporting Atkinson's call for admis-
sions reform and rejection of the 
S.A.T I as an accurate indicator of aca-
demIC success in October.

BRIEFLY 
Supercomputer provides details of the first star 

New cosmological simulations performed on a 
supercomputer in Illinois have provided astro-
physicists with the best indication to date of how 
the first star in the universe formed. The simula· 
tions, detailed in a paper appearing in the Nov. 16 
issue of Science, suggest that the first star resulted 
from the gravitational collapse of a cloud of hydro-
gen and helium 100 times more massive than the 
sun. 

Authors of the paper are UCSD physics professor 
and astrophysicist Michael L. Norman, Tom Abel of 
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and 
Greg L. Bryan of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. 

The results reported in Science were carried 
out on a 16-processor SGI Origin 2000 supercom-
puter at the National Center for Supercomputing 
Applications in Illinois. Current calculations are run-
ning on the 1, lOO·processor IBM Blue Horizon 
machine at the San Diego Supercomputer Center 
at UCSD. 

Norman, who is also a senior fellow at SDSC, is 
eager to extend the calculations to a new, multi-cen-
ter, networked TeraGrid of computers at NCSA, 
SDSC, Caltech and Argonne National Laboratory. The 
$53 million configuration, financed by the National 
Science Foundation, will have a peak speed of about 
14 trillion calculations per second. 

UC Regents approve modest 
employee salary increases 

In an effort to compensate for budget constraints 
on UC-€mployee salary increases, the UC Board of 
Regents approved a modified deferred-compensa-
tion program Nov. 15 that will give all eligible 
employees an additional financial reward by way of 
a special retirement account 

Due to the recent economic downturn and 
resulting decline in state revenues, the University 
of California received significantly reduced state 
funding for 2001 -2002 salary increases. The spe-
cial account, called a Capital Accumulation 
Provision, will be available to all eligible UC 
employees who are members of the UC 
Retirement Plan. The CAP. being proposed will 
put the equivalent of 3 percent of the employee's 
salary into a separate retirement account where it 
will earn interest until the employee begins to 
draw on retirement funds. 
. This is not the first time' the University of 
Califomia has offered employees a CAP. program. In 

the early 19905, when the state's budget was also 
under severe pressure, eligible employees received 
CAP.s to offset disappointing salary increases. To be 
eligible to receive the CAP. accrual credi~ employ-
ees must be active UC Retirement Plan members on 
April 1, 2002. 

National Academy of Sciences 
to hold symposium at UCSD 

As part of the regional meeting of the National 
Academy of Science held on campus, leaders in the 
fields of oceanography, computer 'science, engineer-
ing and the atmospheric scienceS will take part in 
symposium sponsored on Nov. 29 in the Price 
Center Theater at 1 p.m. 

Topics covered in the symposium will include 
oceanography and the Intemet. 

V. Ramanathan and Jeremy Jackson, both of 
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, will cover 
topics relatirg to oceanography and climate sci-
ences. 

Director of the Ludwig Center for Cancer 
Research, Webster Cavenee, will speak on cancer 
research in a lecture titled, "Exploiting Mutations in 
Tumors for Targeted Therapy~ 

Larry Smarr, director of the Califomia Institute 
of Telecommunications and Information 
Technology will deliver a lecture on 'Empowerin~ 
Scientific Research with the 21 st Century Internet. 

The California Institute of Telecommunications 
and Information Technology will broadcast lecture 
through live streaming video between 1 p.m. and

SIO researcher finds waves' 
have become more powerful 

Over the last 50 years, waves hitting Southem 
Califomia have increased in size and intensity, espe-

cial~ in the winter, according to Scripps . Institution of 
Oceanography researcher Nick Graham in a paper that 
appears in the recent edition of Bulleon of the 
American Meterlogical Society. 

Henry Diaz of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration co-authored the article. 

Graham and Diaz hypothesize that the increases 
may be a result of warming sea surface tempera-
tures in the tropics caused by global greenhouse 
warming and natural climate changes.

Muir Quarterly 
spoofs Koala 
M Q editors took offense to jokes 
printed in the Koala~ last issue 
BY SHARON LEE 
Staff Writer 

Staff of the Muir Qllarttrly 
mocked the Koala 'r previous 
issues by creating and distributing 
a look-alike issue called the Koolla 
on Nov. 13 . 

The Koalla featured fare typi-
cal of the real publication, 
including top-five lists and per-
sonals, but criticized the Koala 
and its staff as hateful and 
"dumb." 

The Koala is an A.S.-funded 
publication that has been under 
fire recently for printing what 
some consider to be racist and 
sexist material. In the last month, 
both the Thurgood Marshall 
College Student Council and the 
Revelle College Council passed 
resolutions condemning the 
Koala. 

The Koala's editor in chief, 
George Liddle, had only a few 
comments on the spoof publica-
tion, 

"Anybody who has money can 
print a newspaper. It's nice to see 
the MQ is finally coming to terms 
with ripping off our material." 

The Koalla was created by a 
group of MQ editors who are 
involved in student government 
and student organizations. 
According to MQ editor in chief 
Colin Parent, the students 
decided to take action after the 
most recent Koala was distrib-
uted. 

"As a satire paper, the MQ 

felt that a spoof Koala was really 
a natural thing for us to do," 
Parent said. "A lo! of people at 
UCSD, including members of 
the MQ editorial board, were 
upset at the kind of content that 
the Koala published in their [its[ 
previous issue. We felt that it

UC Berkeley hosts the West Coast Conference for California Schools Against War, 
impressively bringing together like-minded students frqm several campuses · 
By EMILY VlllO 
Contributing Writer 

The applause and cheering sub-
sided JUSt long enough for over 600 
students to agree that they had 
accomplished in a day what should 
have taken a week. 

Then it began again: a slow, 
pa ced clapping that accrued 
momentum, urgency and reso-
nance until the auditorium at UC 
Berkeley thundered with the hectic 
slap of synchronized applause. 

One weekend ago, more than 
600 students from over 45 universi-
ties and community colleges, repre-
senting a growing anti-war student 
movement, registered at the West 
Coast Conference for California 

chools Against War, hosted by 
UC Berkeley. 

ApprOXimately 30 San Diego 
students attended, including 14 
students from UCSD. San Diego 
State UOIversity, University of San 

Diego, San Diego City College and 
Grossmont College students also 
attended. 

I'm no radical, and I lack the 
convictions of a political activist. 
But I was moved by the intellect, 
idealism and energy of the students 
that surrounded me last weekend .. 
At times, I was inspired, and at 
times, I was repelled. Sometimes I 
found myself, startlingly, both. 

We made the nine-hour drive in 
a rented van, arriving in Oaldand, 
Calif. around 3 a.m. to settle in 
creaking, lurching bunk beds in a 
high-ceilinged mansion managed 
by political activists. Mature euca-
lyptus trees and a disheveled green 
garden surround the house, which 
is approached via a cement length 
of tall crooked steps distorted by 
roots and undergrowth. . 

On Saturday morning, Berkeley 
was gray and busy. After registering 
at the door, we waded through a 
clo e, warm hallway jammed witl\ 

folding tables laden with multicol-
ored political pamphlets, and stu-
dents distributing newspapers. 
Before the conference began, the 
seats filled to capacity. Students 
stood in the aisles, crouched in cor-
ners and sat on the stage. 

The speakers were quick to 
inflame the students with harsh 
condemnations of a war that is, 
they said, being waged for purely 
economical reasons at a staggering 
human price. The students agreed. 

"Osama bin Laden isn't the 
most dangerous man in the world, " 
said an Arab speaker to his eager 
audience. "The most dangerous 
man in the world is the president of 
the United States." 

Before performing his poem, a 
poet declared, "The world is domi-
nated by imbecilic assholes." The 
poem was a cacophony of shouts, 
whispers, howls and rants . 
"America has never, never been a 
democracy," he concluded. The 

students loved him. They stood to 
applaud him as he left the stage. 

Did I stand? No. But would I 
say that I was not ·moved? No. I 
wondered at the strength of the 
group's convictions <IS I found 
myself surrounded by up-thrust 
hands, which ceased to make 
applause, forming fists instead. 

At lunch, we lined up to dish let-
tuce, brown rice and lentils from 
plastic buckets onto paper plates, to 
tuck apples and pomegranates into 
our pockets, to tear chunks from 
dense loaves of thick Brown bread, 
protected by crumpled paper sacles. 

Beneath the passion and energy 
lay assuring common sense: Local 
lawyers gave a presentation on 
what students should do if arrested. 
Students attending the conference 
faced a real risk of being investigat-
ed by the government, they say. 

And in fact, a Nov. 12 New York 
TImes article reported that over 200 
U.S. colleges, including San Diego 

State University, were approached 
by federal investigators-1ooking for 
information on students from the 
Middle East. 

According to the article, stu-
dents were interviewed by federal 
agents about "their views on Osama 
bin Laden, the names of their 
favorite restaurants and their plans 
after graduation." 

This puts innocent people at 
risk, the lawyers said. They told 
one student ·to beware of what he 
allows to appear on his online bul-
letin board. They warned an inter-
national student fearing deporta-
tion to a ttend all of her classes. "Be 
careful," they said. 

They were careful : Throughout 
the conference, some students 
deliberately sat out of view from 
the cameras, which record faces, 
cOAversations and ideas. 

I was struck by their bravery.

Nov. 5) amazed me. Despite Goh's 
numerous and apparent concerns 
for the welfare of humanity, he 
failed to address the consequences 
of utter ignorance. Far worse than 
the alleged detriment of environ-
mentalism, in my opinion, is the 
prospect of being bullied by a 
horde of unsubstantiated general-
izations. 

Goh's article claimed that most 
environmentalists seek "to bring 
Earth closer to the time before 
human civilization spread across 
the globe," demonstrating a pro-
found lac.k of understanding of the 
current environmental movement. 
He asserts that environmentalists 
are fearmongers who are trying 
wildly to oppose any and all scien-
tific and technological advance-
ment. He even goes so far as to 
claim that environmentalists 
doomed the space program. 

To the contrary, it is often envi-
ronmental groups who push the 
hardest for the implementation of 
new technologies. Almost all of the 
major national environmental 
groups' agendas include things 
such as clean, renewable energy 
sources, solar panels, improved 
wind power generators and more 

efficient automobile engine tech-
nologies. 

I had the opportunity to intern 
in Washington, D.C. this summer. 
During a number of Senate and 
House committee hearings, envi-
ronmentalists invariably argued for 
newer, cleaner and safer technolo-
gies, while others claimed these 
solutions would be either too 
expensive or too difficult to carry 
out. 

It is true that enviro'nrnental 
groups do not embrace a11 new 
advances with open arms. 
Genetica11y engineered crops, one 
example the author uses, have 
been shown through scientific 
study to pose serious health risles 
- in fact, the British Medical 
Association has called for an indef-
inite moratorium on genetically 
engineered foods. These crops 
usually require the increased use 
of pesticides and can sometimes 
cause life-threatening allergies in 
people who were previously able 
to eat certain foods. 

Yet most environmental groups 
are not calling for these foods to be 
removed from the market. They 
are merely pushing for the same 
testing and labeling that the Food 

and Drug Administration requires 
of every other novel substance 
introduced into our diets. 

The problem with generaliza-
tions is that, when pressed, the 
specifics fall apart. Goh may be 
surprised to find out that our inter-
est in saving the forests doesn't 
necessarily mean we want to li ve in 
the trees.

As Emily Vizzo notes in her 
article ("No need to run," Nov. 
13), this September, Gov. Gray 
Davis signed into law AB 521, 
"The Student Financial 
Responsibility Act," designed to 
provide students in higher educa-
tion with relief from the escalating 
crunch of credit card debt. 

Credit in the hands of a young 
consumer who is uneducated about 
the personal responsibility associ-
ated with credit can lead to finan-
cial disaster. This is a growing and 
very serious problem with younger, 
college-age consumers. 

The act can help stop credit

card abuse before financial ruin is 
inevitable. Among other things, 
the new law calls on California's 
three public higher education sys-
tems (the University of California, 
the State College system and com-
munity colleges), as well 3S private 
and independent colleges, to regu-
late the marketing practices used 
on campus by credit card compa-
nies. 

More important, due to its 
long-term positive impact, the new 
law requires that credit card and 
debt education and counseling ses-
sions become a regular part of 
campus orientation of new stu-
dents. 

Working for Springboard 
(www.crtdit.org), an accredited, 
nonprofit consumer credit coun-
seling agency, I know that real-
world, financial education is a 
must for students. Without it, stu-
dents can find themselves over-
whelmed with not only credit card 
debt, but student loan debt as 
well . 

Some colleges and universities 
have some credit counseling in 
place, but it is imperative that col-

Appreciate campus improvements and changes 
On-campus apartment renovations demonstrate consideration 
By WILSON CHEN 
Contributing Writer 

Sometimes, changes are for the 
better. 

The other day, I visited a 
friend's apartment on the first floor 
of Black Hall in Earl Warren 
College. Two years and some time 
ago, I was a sophomore living in 
that same apartment. What a dif-
ference two years can make! 

I was truly taken aback by what 
I saw when I walked in. The carpets 
and walls were fresh, and the ta ble 
and chairs looked like higher-qual-
ity furniture . 

I know renovation takes care of 
those things, but the new inhabi-
tants of Black Hall now have com-
fortable couches the length of the 
living room wall. That's a 10- to 
12-foot sofa that can seat tons of 
people or be the perfect naptime 
pal. I t'S a very nice couch - it rede-
fines the meaning of watching tele-
vision. Somebody can lie down in 
most any position he wants. It's a 
companion for the true couch pota-

had begun to plan. By 2 p.m., the 
enormous chalkboard at the front of 
the room was coated with filmy dust 
from constant erasing and rewriting. 
There were lis~, ideas: a walkout, a 
fast, a protest, a march. 

And there was an idea conceived 
and developed two weeks ago in San 
Diego: an event in December 
addressing the humanitarian crisis in 
Mghanistan. The proposal was voted 
on a t the con ference and passed. 

The discussion splintered into 
bickering over procedural points as 
the afternoon wore on. Several stu-
dents, enraged at what they called a 

to. The sofa also prevents couch 
thefts, big as it is. No one would try 
moving those things in and out, 
and they would not fit into an ele-
vator, either. 

Then I turned my head and saw 
the kitchen. What a makeover -
new whi te stoves, a nice, clean 
white refrigerator and new sinks, 
countertops and tiled floors. What 
I noticed most in the cooking area 
were the cabinets: pine-colored, 
smooth, classy-looking cabinets 
with aluminum handles. We used 
to have ugly, reddish, dirty-looking 
things. The countertops and 
pantries match the cabinets, mak-
ing the new ones stand out ever so 
much more. 

It's hard to describe the good 
feeling you have when you see 
these improvements. One would 
likely have to experience it for him-
self. 

As if all that were not enough, I 
saw the bedrooms and fqund they 
have those nice wooden beds that 
most of the first-year dorms use. 
You can adjust the height of the bed 

lack of procedural democracy, left 
the room to shout in the hallway. 
Everyone was tired. We began to 
think about the long drive home. 

The students broke into com-
mittees to discuss further organiza-
tion. When to fast? Where to 
march? When to protest? They 
promised to stay in contact. 

It was dark again, and we drove 
back to the mansion on our quiet 
street in Oalcland. We stripped our 
beds, jammed our clothes into 
backpacks and suitcases, and 
squeezed into the van. 

We promised ourselves a short

frames for your own personal com-
fort. I had to live a whole year with 
those nasty steel frames, so I could 
not believe my eyes at first. Perhaps 
I'm exaggerating, but those old 
beds did seem pretty gross. 

On the whole, the renovation 
reflects school policy. This is a 
notable fact : It means the school 
cares enough to enhance the life of 
its students. 

A lot of freshmen are probably 
discontent that they will have to 
move off campus from now on -
but the ones who can stay at school 
will be living much better. 

Please cherish what the univer-
sity has done for you. It is a real 
treat. I am not going to go over-
board and shower the UCSD 
authorities with compliments, but I 
do realize that an effort has been 
made to make the students happy. 

So when I see all those trays, 
dishes and silverware from the din-
ing halls lying around, it makes me 
sick. First of all, because they are 
not yours, many of you just leave 
them lying around, ruining the 

dinner break and ate our hamburg-
ers and millcshakes in the van, 
counting the miles to San Diego. It 
was past 3 a.m. when we returned 
to UCSD. 

I'm no radical, but I was inspired 
by the inteUigence and the fierce ide-
alism of the students I met. I heard 
their argumen~ and watched their 
plans form all weekend. 

It is said that 5 to 7 million 
Mghanis will die of starvation this 
winter because of the war. In 
December, as discussed at the con-
ference, universities will hold

Second, why the heck are you 
stealing? Take couch thieving, for 
example; once I saw with my own 
eyes people stuffing one into an 
elevator. 

Maybe I am being biased, but 
the apartments are gorgeous and 
the campus is visually appealing -
if not wonderful - so I hope stu-
dents know what they have before 
it is gone. 

For those guys who deliberate-

action. 

I have seen a small moment of 
political movement, and I am 
attracted. There is seduction in 
human movement, particularly for 
those isolated in the warm cocoon 
of their micro-reality. 

I wondered at my own position 
as self-appointed thinker, self-
appointed Ilonactor. What truths 
escaped my attempts at objectivity? 

I recalled the applause, the fists, 
the chalkboard caked with dust and 
ideas. I was quietly moved.

LGBT to get new building 
Resource center expected to provide more services 
By EVAN McLAUGHUN 
Staff Writer 

The Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Resource Office 
unveiled plans for its new resource center Nov. 14 at the offices 
second anniversary celebration. 

The new center will be in a more conspicuous location and will 
also have three times a's much space as the current office. 

LGBTRO Director Shaun Travers said the existing LGBTRO, 
located adjacent to the Bursar's Office, has shortcomings that will 
be remedied with the move to the new facility, which will be near 
the Gilman Parking Structure. . 

"Just by virtue of having more space, we will be able to serve 
more of the community," Travers said. 

Plans for the new office include a kitchen, full library, outdoor 
deck and a reception area. Travers, the only full-time staff member 
'at the office, hopes that the new center will be used for group 
events and that people will talee advantage of the material available 
at the center dealing with gender and sexuality issues. 

"It bodes well for us to be a continued strong presence in the 
campus community and to be a valued part of diversity here a~ 
UCSD," Travers said. "We are excited because this project will 
allow us to extend our offerings to the community." 

While the project was financed by funds allocated by the 
UCSD general campus fund, the LGBTRO does not have suffi-
cient funds to furnish the new facility. The office is accepting con-
triliutions to help fund the project.

Anthrax found at Howard U. 
Deadly disease found in mail room's sorting system 

WASHINGTON - Howard 
University closed eight mail facili-
ties Monday after traces of anthrax 
spores were found at its main mail-
room over the weekend. 

The rnailroom is the first non-
governmental facility to test positive 
for anthrax after receiving contami-
nated mail from the District's 
Brentwood postal facility. 

A sorti ng machine from the 
mailroom , located on the 
Administration building'S bottom 
level, tested positive for anthrax. It 
was the only sample out of 54 to 
yield positive test resul~. 

Mail sorting facilities in 
Meridian Hill Hall, Howard Plaza 
Towers, Carver Hall , and Siowe 
Hall, in addition to facilities at the 
divinity and law schools, were also 
closed but later reopened after test-
ing finished. 

Students were surprised the 
potentially deadly bacteria hit so 
close to campus, despite the discov-
ery of anthrax: in I I congressional 
offices this week. 

"This is kind of unsettling that 
anthrax just keeps popping up all 
over the place and no one knows 
about it until someone finds it," 
said freshman history major 
Anthony Gisby.

The Brentwood facility is the 
likely source of the spores, univer-
sity officials said. Four postal work-
ers contracted anthrax after a letter 
mailed to Sen. Tom Daschle's 
Capitol Hill office containing 
anthrax spores was processed at the 
facility. Two of the workers died 
weeks ago and a third remains hos-
pitalized. 

Many students questioned the 
length of time the spores have lived 
in the mailroom. 

"It's almost been a month since 
the people got it at the

D.C. and they are just figuring out 
that it may be here," said sopho-

Donna Brock said the testing 
would not greatly alter normal 
functions at Howard. 

"We don't see this as a big dis-
ruption," Brock said. "We aren't 
closing the university." 

However, some students believe 
that the problem is larger than uni-
versity officials wish to disclose.

mail didn't touch some mail with 
anthrax on it?" asked freshm:m biol-

offices in the Hart Senate Office

New A.S. 
• • position 

approved 
Commissioner 
of Athletics to 
advise Council 
By MARGARET O'NEill 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council voted 
Wednesday night to approve the 
creation of the office of 
Commissioner of Athletics. The 
amendment to the constirution must 
be a pproved by three of the fi ve col-
lege councils to take effect. 

According to the legislation, 
which was proposed by Vice 
President Internal Jeon Brown and 
Director of Athletics Robin 
Shelton, the commissioner of ath-
letics will be responsible for 
informing and representing the 
A.S. Council on matters of intercol-
legiate athletics by attending Triton 
Athletes' Council meetings and 
serving on the executive council of 
Triton Tide. The commissioner 
will also work to increase atten-
dance at NCAA events, increase 
athletic awareness on campus, sup-
port the needs of NCAA athletes, 
and will supervise and direct all 
appointments regarding athletics. 

Shelton said that he feels such a 
position is necessary to represent the 
700 srudents involved in athletics at 
UCSD. 

Brown said that the office of 
commissioner has a much larger 
reach than the current director posi-
tion. The director of athletics posi-
tion is under the A.S. president. The 
commissioner of athletics' office will 
have a budget and staff members to . 
represent different aspects of athlet-
ics, including club sports. 

"Seeing as our teams are doing 
really well right now, we thought 
this would be a-good time to not 
only show the srudent body how 
good our programs are, but to sup-
port our srudent athletes as well," 
Brown said. 

The Unity slate, from which 
most of the sitting A.5. Council was 
elected, campaigned last year on the 
issue of representation for athletes. 

David Hawk, an Eleanor 
Roosevelt College sophomore and 
right-fielder for the UCSD mens 
basebalJ team, said he thinks the 
position will have positive effects. 

"This will create a better athletic 
atmosphere throughout the cam-
pus," Hawk said. "The more expo-
sure the better for any aspects of ath-
letics at our school in particular." 

Shelton also said he thinks the 
A.S. Council's increased involve-
ment with athletes will benefit the 
campus atmosphere. 

"1 think something everybody is 
looking for is more spirit and a more 
uni6ed campus, and athletics does 
that," he said. "Its one of the few 
things that everyone can relate to." 

Shelton, who competed on 
UCSDs golf team for two years, said 
he thinks the position will have other 
bene6 IS as well. 

"[fhe position] is going to 
broaden the base of A.S.," he said. 
"It will help to improve the srudent-
athlete relationship aDd atmosphere 
on campus." 

The legislation was presented to 
four of the college counci ls last 
Thursday, along with legislation to 
add the position of cOlTunissioner of 
diversity affairs. 

According to A.S. President Jeff 
Dodge, Thurgood Marsha I College 
Srudent Council and Srudent 
Council of ERC already approved 
both positions and Muir ColJege 
Council approved the commissioner 
of diversity affairs and still has to 
vote on commissioner of athletics. 

"1bis is a good step si nce we 
have made the change to [Division] 
II," Hawk said.

r obert James Stevenson loves Harry Potter books, ice cream sundaes and pizza. Like nearly all 5 -year-old 
. children, he loves to play games with 
his friends, go the beach and spend time 
with his family. He has a doting mother and 
two older sisters, and at first glance, he 
seems just like any ordinary young child. 

But one year ago, Robert became a 
national statistic that would horrify the 
average American. Last year, like more than 
750,000 other people in the United States, 
Robert and his mother, Pat, were homeless. 

In October 2000, Robert's father, a 
British citi2.en who was residing illegally in 
the United States, was picked up by local 
immigration authorities and deported bac.k 
to his homeland. 

Pat, a 43-year-old who was trying to care 
for Robert and two daughters from a previ-
ous marriage, knew that her family needed 
help. It was then that a social worker direct-
ed Pat toward the St. Vincent de Paul's shel-
ter. 

St. Vincent de Paul Village is one of 
seven facilities, each known as one of Father 
joe's Villages. Led by Catholic priest Joe 
Carroll, it is ·a large, transitional facility in 
downtown San Diego and is currently 
home to more than 865 residents, 163 of 
whom are children. 

What began as a small operation in 
1950, consisting of volunteers who handed 
out peanut butter sandwiches to the home-
less, has become an extensive facility that 
houses not only hundreds of residents, but 
several programs and services, all of which 
are dedicated to providing the homeless 
with resources that they would not other-
wise have acce s to. 

While the facility prides itself on the 
strucrure and stability that it provides to its 
inhabitants, those who reside at St. 
Vincent's benefit from the numerous ser-
vices that the organization offers. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

These services include an assessment 
c,enter, where clients receive individual case 
plans for educational competency and voca-
tional testing. St. Vincent's also provides 
case management programs where long-
term residents are paired up with a case 
manager who helps them with setting goals, 
monitoring finances, achieving tasks, voca-
tional adult education programs, English as 
a Second Language, dyslexia, budgeting, 
computer, writing, career counseling, 
employment programs, psychological 
counseling services and chemical depen-
dency prwarns There are several other 
programs designed to assist homeless indi-
viduals and families in the quest to relfolin 
stability. 

In addition to these resources, St. 
Vincent's provides nearly 4,000 meals to 
both residents and nonresidents each day. 

The intermediary facility has two 
options available to those in need. As par-
ticipants of the short-term program, indi-
viduals can stay at St. Vincent's for up to 90 
days free of charge. In the long-term pro-
gram, residents can stay at the shelter for up 
to two years, and are required to commit 
themselves to a structured lifestyle and par-
ticipate in certain courses like the case man-
agement prognim. 

St. Vincent's also assists residents of the 
long-term program in obtaining employ-
ment and helps them to pursue higher edu-
cation. All residents who are on the long-
term track must use one-third of their 
income to pay rent and must place another 
one-third in a savings account. The remain-
ing portion of their income may be used 
toward personal expenses and serves as 
spending money.

Women's

By PAVNI MEHOTRA 
Contributing Writer 

"My entire car ' was filled to 
take over to the Women's 
Resource Center in Oceanside," 
said Emelyn A. Dela Pena, pro-
gram director at the Women 's 
Center. She spoke of last year's 
Thanksgiving Food Drive, an 
effort that was repeated this year 
with considerable success. 

Continuing, she described the 
reaction of those at the Center who 
received what she carted over.

this yea r's Toy and Food Drive. 
The drive calls for nonperishable 
food items and new, unwrapped 
toys and gifts - anything from rat-
tles to makeup to video games. 
Kaiser Permenente's Ped iatrics 
Unit will distribute the toys this 
yea r to hospitalized chi ldren.

Adopt-a-Family supplies food 
"The look on their faces when I 

arrived was amazing," Dela Pen a 
said. "All they could say was that 
we were going to fill their pantries 
for a while." 

Mirium Khwaja, Warren senior 
and assistant di rector of Volunteer 
Connection, coordinated last year's 
Toy and Food Drive. In total, the 
drive collected 1,290 pounds of 
food and 800 toys last year, she 
said. The drive received the San 
Diego Food Bank's Bronze Fork 
Award for its contribution of food . 

Students bestow Thankgiving dinners upon rieedy Though the deadline for the Thanksgiving food drive has 
passed, the mission to provide for 
those in need continues as the 
Womens Center holds its Holiday 
Food Drive, which will run until 
Dec. 10. 

Volunteers spent the majority of 
their time wrapping boxes for the 
toys, which were then distributed 
at over 20 roy-deposit locations on 
campus. 

In the end, the students from 
VC - and Santa - were able to 
deliver the toys to sick children at 
Hillcrest Medical Center. 

"It was such a rewarding experi-

In two days, most of us will be 
on our way back to our famjlies 
for the upcoming holiday week-
end. It's safe to say that we are 
more excited to get away from 
campus for a last breather before 
(gulp) finals than we are for that 
turkey Thursday night. 

Honestly now, how many of 
us actually think about how luclcy 
we are to sit down to an array of 
mouth-watering, warm dishes, 
while there are many others 
around the world who are not as 
fortunate? 

Forget the big picture and just 
peer into San Diego's communi-
ty. There are many families that 
cannot even afford to have a little 
Thanksgiving dinner. 

UCSD students can extend 
their hands this holiday season by 

UCSD Bookstore 
*and*

signing up with the Adopt-a-
Family project on campus 
through the Volunteer 
Connection Office located on the 
second floor of the Price Center. 

According to Special Projects 
Director Kimmy Chela, a junior 
at Eleanor Roosevelt College, 
the project is targeted at many 
needy families that don't have the 
means to celebrate this holiday. 
Adopt-a-Family's objective is to 
provide them with a 
Thanksgiving dinner and an 
unforgettable season. 

Chela said that this project has 
been an annual event at UCSD 
and attraCts all organizations. 

"Basically," she explained, "we 
deliver a flier describing the pro-
ject to every on-campus organi-
zation mailbox, and so far, more 
than 40 applications have been 
turned in. Our goal' is to reach 75 
families." 

This year, there has been an 
influx of people participating in 
this event, and other facilities 
have been used to find needy 
families, such as the Welfare 
Office, which in turn results in 
more families having a 
Thanksgiving dinner. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
senior Megan Williams, who also 
works at the Volunteer 
Connection Office, explained 
that each group that fills out an 
application to adopt a family is 
then matched to a farnily. 

"All we do is match them to 
the family," Williams noted. 
"They contact the family and fig-
ure out how to bring them their 
Thanksgiving dinner." The 
group or individual usually caters 
to what the family wants, 
whether that is raw ingredients, a 

See ADOPT, Page '5 

Preferred items, which can be 
donated to the Women's Center, 
are any nonperishable food items 
or traditional holiday foods such as 
stuffing mix and gift certificates for 
turkey or ham. 

"Last year was our first time 
doing a food drivc, and the 
response was overwhelming," said 
Dela Pena. "People from the com-
munity and from UCSD gave us a 
tremendous respOnse."

Homeless: 
Families often hit hard 
by life on the street 
Continued from pace 9 
organization benefit from the strict 
rules governing their Stay at the 
facility. 

"We try and instill a sense of 
responsibility in our residents," 
1suchiya said. ,"Everyone has to pay 
rent, and our long-term residents 
are no exception. The result of this 
is that when they get back on their 
feet and go back into the real 
world, they are better prepared." 

Trina Poore, who is in the 
short-term program, came to St. 
Vincent's because she had nowhere 
else to go. One year ago she was 
living in her Imperial Beach apart-
ment with her three children, ages 
nine to II , when her landlord 
raised the rent. She · was in the 
process of taking the rent increase 
to court when her apartment was 
robbed: She lost her entire savings. 

With no way to pay the rent, 
Poore was not only bankrupt, she 
had no prace to go; she was not in 
direct contact with her husband 
and had no one to depend on. 

She called lnfoline, an informa-
tional number that helps connect 
the homeless with emergency food 
and shelter services. The operator 
at Infoline directed her toward St. 
Vincent's, where she and her chil-
dren enrolled in the Overflow 
Program. Through this program, 
Poore and her children were able to 
sleep at the shelter - usually on 
mats in the dining room - but 
during the daytime, they had to 
leave the property. From there, the 
family was chosen to go to the sea-
sonal shelter until being transferred 
to St. Vincent's. 

While Poore, who has epilepsy 
and Ortho-Arthritis, had a number 
of jobs prior to arriving at the shel-
ter, she told of her difficulties in 
obtaining employment because of 

vwcertified 
PRE·OWNED 

~:;. WVJWVW 

her disability and financial state. 
Although she has tried numerous 
times to maintain a steady job, she 
has had little success and has no 
choice but to depend on acquiring 
Social Security Income in order to 
provide for hersel f and her three 
young children. 

"My biggest challenge is finding 
a job," Poore said. "Unfortunately, 
no one seems to want to hire a dis- _ 
abled person, and no amount of 
qualifications is going to change 
that." 

Poore, who enjoys baking and 
dreams of pursuing a career in culi-
nary arts, feels that her experience 
at St. Vincent's has made her more 
independent and has helped her to 
pursue her goals. 

"After coming to St. Vincent's, I 
have much more confidence in 
myself," Poore claimed. "I know 
that I can now make it by myself 
with my children and that I don't 
have to depend on my husband. I 
have learned that I can be success-
ful without him if I need to." 

Through St. Vincent's, Poore 
has been able to attain legal assis-
tance in order to pursue SS!. In 
addition, she has been able to enroll 
her children in reputable schools in 
the San Diego area and is currently 
saving money for renting a new 
apartment. According to Poore, 'the 
support of her children has con-
tributed to the strengthening of her 
relationship with them. 

"When we initially arrived here, 
they used to say to me, 'Mom, why 
do we have to be here?' and J had to 
explain our situation to them, even 
though they were nor happy to be 
here," Poore said. "Now'they seem 
more understanding of our situa-
tion, and they have learned to 
accept it as reality." 

Bernie Mills, the residential ser-
vices manager at St. Vincent de 
Paul's Village, promotes the several 
services offered by the organiza-
tion. 

"When clients come in, they 
are directed to go into programs

Time for shlring: From left to right Sl Vincent residents Michael Beck, Kim McLean, Catherine Orlando, Susan Anderson, 
Pat Stevenson and Eric Pederson discuss the positive changes brought about by their stay at the shelter. 
and services right away," Mills 
said. "One of these programs is 
the 'Challenge to Change': a 
three- week, five-days-a-week 
course that gives our clients 
thoughts and ideas in terms of 
what they need to do to make the 
changes available in their life. It is 
a motivational seminar, and it 
gives them direction in terms ' of 
what exactly it is they might want 
to do while they are here." 

In addition to tlhese programs, 
St. Vincent's also provides a chil -
dren's services program. Through 
this program, residents who work 
during the day are provided with 
free on-site child care. Mills stress-
es St. Vincent's commitment to 
bettering the lives of its residents. 

"One of the most rewarding 
things about working here is the 
client contact," Mills stated. 

"Nothing beats the feeling of 
knowing that you can make a deci-
sion that affects someone's life in a 
positive way." 

Perhaps the most sobering of 
stories is that of Laura Rubio, who ' 
came to St. Vincent's in June 2001 
and cntered the long-term pro-
gram in October. Rubio, who has 
seven children, ages three to 16, 
was Icft homeless in 1999. With no 
moncy, no place to call home and a 
severc drug and alcohol addiction, 
Rubio's children were takcn by 
Child Protective Services and 
placed into foster care. 

She claims that she was in denial 
about her situation and was not 
ready for her situation to change. 

"Thank God there is St. 
Vincent's," Rubio said . "It is 
through their programs that I, as a 
recovering addict, have becn able 

to w1derstand my addiction, and 1 
have learncd how ro prevent myself 
from venturing down the same 
destructive path." 

Rubio, who hopes to one day 
reunitc with the children she left 
behind, credits her accomplish-
ments to the shelter. 

"This place has given me sta-
bility and a formal way to get 
started again in my life," she said. 
"When a person is homeless, it is 
very hard for thcm to evcn think 
about staying sober, especially if 
you arc an addict or an alcoholi c. 
The shelter has helped me to have 
a warm bed, three meals a day and 
to get my mind straight so that I 
am able to focus on things that I 
need to be aware of to go forward 
in my life."

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 

Guardian time rewarding despite hard work 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Sports Editor 

I love journalism. It is more 
than a job: It is a pa sion. Some 
people have said that it goes back to 
my love of writing. I think it goes 
far beyond that. There is some-
thing about the entire process of 
finding the perfect story and 
watching it materialize that puts a 
smile on my face. 

This is why I slave at the 
Guardian for minimal pay. For me, 
the compensation is in the result. I 
can think of nothing more satisfy-
ing (save for woman-related activi-
ties) than walking through the halls 
of campus on a Monday or 
Thursday morning and seei ng stu-
dents reading an article that I wrote 
or . g at a page that I laid out. 

ve known little of the ways 
of work other than journalism. My 
mother told me to get a job when I 
was 16. After dragging my feet for 
a few months, I stumbled across an 
ad in the local paper that 
announced the opening of a sports 
reporter position. The ad said that 
the position was open to students 
and that no experience was neces-
sary. It seemed like the least 
amount of work that I could possi-
bly do while still getting paid, so I 
decided to apply. 

The interview was short and 
general. The writing test was ele-
mentary. The sports editor called 
me back a week later and offered 
me the job, which I happill' accept-
ed . Not only did I now have a cake 
job, but I was also getting paid to 
watch sports. It was a dream come 
true. 

It was a small-town paper with a 

readership of only around 30,000 
people. My first assignment was [0 
cover a Little League game. I 
watched the game, timidly con-
ducted only two interviews and 
proceded to write a piece-of-shit 
article. When I opened the paper 
the next day, I was ecstatic to see 
my name in the byline. My level of 
excitement soon dropped when I 
saw that I was looking at a different 
article than the one I had turned in; 
most of it had been rewritten. 

While most young writers 
would have been discouraged by 
this, I was still hooked. I raced to 
the sports department of the paper 
(which cQnsisted of only two peo-
ple) and begged for them [0 teach 
me. I was like a sponge, ready to 
soak up any bit of knowledge that 
they had to offer. After I wrote my 
next article, I stayed later and 
watched them hack my article to 
shreds, learning what I had done 
wrong and filing the information 
away for future use. Soon my arti-
cles needed no hacking, just small 
touches. 

I worked at that paper until I 
came [0 college. I spent many 
nights covering high school sports, 
a few college games and even a pro 
game or two. ] worked my way up 
to a regular news reporter, covering 
my own beat. When I left, the 
managing editor [Old me that there 
would always be a job open for me. 
That is something I took great 
pride in. 

Whenever J told people that I 
worked for the local paper, they 
would always ask me if that was 
something that I wanted to do for a 
career. I usually smiled and [Old 
them that a journalist'S life wasn't 

for me. The idea of becoming a 
professional journalist was some-
thing that J had only briefly flirted 
with. After seeing the long, hard 
hours that the editors at the paper 
had to put in for the peanuts that 
they made in salary, J decided that 
undergraduate study in political 
science followed by law school 
would be the better choice. 

J came to the Guardian with an 
extremely cocky attitude. I had 
worked in the professional ranks of 
journalism for over two years when 

I can think of nothing 
mOie satisfying (save 

for woman-related 
activities) than walking 

through the halls of 
campus on a Monday 
or Thursday morning 
and seeing students 

reading an article that I 
wrote or gazing at a 
page that I laid out. 

I joined this paper. I knew how to 
layout a section, how to write and 
edit articles and what I thought to 
be a lot of Associated Press style 
(which J later learned was next to 
nothing). 

As I spent countless hours at 
this paper, pouring my heart and 
soul into a publication that most 
people glance over once before 
depositing in the trash, I built a 
strong bond with the other stu-
dents on sta ff. There we were, a 

group of students who, for the 
most part, do not aspire to become 
professional journalists, putting out 
a quality papor twice a week. J came 
to ca ll tI,ese coworkers friends. \i e 
shared a common bond of striving 
for excellence. 

I was faced with a rough deci -
sion last year. After not gening a 
position that I had worked very 
hard for, J began to question my 
desire to return to the paper. I 
wanted to become the paper's man-
aging editor, which is one step 
below the editor in chief. I wanted 
the responsiblility and the pride 
that came with that position. I felt 
that I was ready for it, but the staff 
found a better candidate. 

The loss forced me to think 
about why I came to the paper in 
the first place. None of us are paid 
very well in relation to the time and 
energy that we invest on a daily 
basis into this paper. We certainly 
don't receive any positive recogni-
tion from the campus. It is a truly 
thankless job. 

But then J thought back to the 
days when I first began to work in 
journalism. I remembered the 
pride that I felt when someone read 
my articles. I remembered how sa t-
isfied I felt after producing a quali-
ty section. I also remembered how 
much I loved the paper. It ' was 
more than that, though; I loved the 
people. We had been friends. That 
much I never questioned. VVhat I 
hadn 't realized was that we had 
become a family. We shared in each 
other's triumphs as well as 
mourned with each other's sorrows. 
T hat was why I came back this 
yea r. My family needed me. 

ow, I have conceded that ours 

is a thankless job. I don't expect 
people to come up to us on Library 
\ Valk and tell us that we wrotc 
good articles or put out :I quality 
issue. In fact, I expect criticism. I 
welcome it. It is ti,e only WJ y that 
we can improve and better serve 
the campus. 

T his is why I was so in favor of 
the Gllardiall message board on the 
papcr's Web site. I was eager to see 
what fe .:dback people had for us. 
Imagine my surprise whcn I looked 
on the mes age board and found 
some of the lamest comments I 
could possibly think of. I'm not up 
here sayi ng that some of my articles 
are not worthy of criticism. I'll be 
the first to admit that they arc. All 
that I am asking for are intelligent 
criticisms - original ones, at least. 

The first one that I take issue 
with is a comment about my col-
unm about Barry Bonds. In the 
article, I call Barry Bonds an ego-
tistical jerk who isn't the premiere 
power hitter in the game. J said that 
he had a good lineup around him 
and a ballpark that was built specif-
ically for him to hit homeruns m. 
The comments stemming from this 
article were disappointing at best. 

One of the ones that irks me the 
most is one t1,at states I am a horri -
ble sports writer who has never met 
Bonds personally so I shouldn 't 
judge his personality and make 
assumptions. The comment went 
on to say that PacBell Park is not a 
hitter 's park and is , in fact , a pitch-
er's park.

Soapbox: 
Responses to posts 
about sports columns 
Continued from pace 13 

Allow me to retort. While this 
person thought that I shouldn't 
make assumptions, they in fact 
made a few fatal ones of their own. 
Namely, I have been a professional 
sports writer. I have covered a 
Giants game in person and have 
met Bonds. There is a reason that 
he is known throughout the sports 
community as an egotistical jerk: 
He is one. Even if! hadn't met him, 
all I need to point out to prove my 
point are the numerous occasions 
in which he has called himself the 
best baseball player to ever play the 
game, or the time that he actually 
thought about wearing No. 24 for 
the Giants - a number retired for 
the great Willie Mays. 

As for thinlcing that Pac Bell 
Park was not built for Bonds to hit 
homers in: why, then, does it have 
one of the shortest porches in right 
coupled with a breeze that always 
blows out that way? 

The other comment that gOt to 
me was some moron who respond-
ed to a couple of my articles by 
using the words of Triumph the 
Insul t Dog, popularized by Conan 
O'Brien, and saying that my arti-
cles were something "for [him] to

the Staff Association's toy drive, 
saw the potential for worlcing with 
a student organization to expand 
the existing drive. 

Echoing Khwarja, White said of 
the effort, "It's lots of work, but it's 
rewarding." 

Without the cooperation ofVC 
it couldn 't have been so successful, 
according to White. 

Cooperation among students, 
faculty and staff has always been a 
goal for White. She has worked for 
over seven years with various cam-

hot and ready meal or even just 
money. 

Accord ing to Williams, a variety 
of UCSD organizations have come 
forward . She listed residence halls, 
all the five colleges, the A.S. 
Counci l, different fraternities and 
sororities, the Triton Water Polo 
team, and lntervarsity Christian 
Fellowship. 

Roosevelt junior Shannon Patal, 
the co-chair of ERC's Community 
Outreach Effort, is joining in the 
Adopt-A-Farni ly project this year 
for the first time. 

"We got a lot of positive feed-
back from students," she said, "and 
we are excited (0 work together to 
hel pothers." 

T here are people who rely on 
such help to provide their families 
with dinner on Thanksgiving 
night. 

San Diego resident Evelyn 
Cautivar is just one of the many 
people benefitting from this pro-
gram. She is a single mother of four 
boys who took part in Adopt-A-
Family last year and will again this 
year. Cautivas feels that the project 
aids many needy families here in 
San Diego. 

" It is a hardship - a struggle -
to buy food," she said, "and this 
helps." She added, "A lot." She 
described how her sons "were real-
ly happy" when they heard they 
were going (0 have a real 
Thanksgiving dinner last year, and 
were "beyond excited" when the 
meal actually arrived. 

poop on. " Come on, can't you even 
think of your own insults? That's 
pretty lame. 

There was also a comment that 
said that the person didn't want to 
see my opinion in the sports col-
umn and that I was paid to write 
about sports. If you're not sup-
posed to put your opinion into a 
column, then what are you sup-
posed to put into it? 

I bring up these instances not to 
sound like a third-grader getting in 
a name-calling contest (although I 
invite those two half-wits to come 
out of their cave-like dorms of 
'Internet porn and soap operas and 
stumble up to the GUlIriJiIl" office 
for one anytime), but rather to

ence, this has been the best coali-

"Who knows what else may 
come of this great collaboration?" 
she said . 

The Toy and Food Drive will

campus and runs from Nov. 19 to 
Dec. 6. Toys can also be donated

A.S. President Jeff Dodge, who 
has delivered food three times 
through Adopt-a-Family, feels 
that seeing the excitement on the 
childre n 's faces is the best part. 

"The parents keep trying to say 
thank you," he recalled, "but the 
excitement of the kids just said it all 
- that was all we needed to really 
understand just how much this din-
ner meant to them." 

On last year's delivery, Dodge 
explained thilt the A.S. Council 
went out the night before and 
bought the food, along with a few 
kitchen supplies, and the next 
morning met the family. 

"We actually stayed and talked 
with the family for a Ii nle bit," he 
said. "It was a very good experi-
ence. We all left feeling warm-
hearted, especially because of the 
kids' exci tement." 

Williams summed it up by say-
ing that delivering the dinner and 
seeing the joy they bring makes 
participants feel like they are giving 
back. 

"That is what Thanksgiving is 
about, right?" she asked.

Shelter: 
Shelter helps residents 
'get life back on track' 
Continued from page 11 

While there are several families 
that reside at St. Vincent's, the 
majority of residents are single men 
and women who come to the facil -
ity to seek help for their financial 
and drug-related problems. 

Mary Stephans, 32, first came 
to the shelter in May 2000 to get 
help for her drug addiCtIon. After 
hea ring about thc program 

through her parents, Stephans 
decided to come to St. Vincent's 
because she wanted to get her life 
back on track. 

"I really wanted to change and I 
wanted to grow up," Stephans said. 
"I wanted to quit blaming other 
people for why I became homeless, 
for losing jobs and for my imma-
ture behavior." 

Stephans, whose husband cur-
rently has custody of their young 
child, attributed many of her suc-
cesses at St. Vincent's to the struc-
nlre with which the organization 
has providcd her. 

"r think the Challenge to 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Change program was very impor-
tant to me, because prior to coming 
here, I did nm sec that my behavior 
was an impeding factor in my life," 
Stephans said. "I'd just yell at peo-
ple because that was my way of 
dealing with the problems I was 
having. They have rules here, and 
abiding by them has taught me the 
discipline that I will be able to u e 
in the real world.» 

For residents at St. Vincent de 
Paul ' , the fact that the facility is 
home to an on-site medical and 
dental clinic. a career and educa-
tional c~nter and counseling ser-
vices, among others, is a motiva ting

factor for those who utilize these 
resourccs. 

"It's important to recognize that 
a homeless person has no 
resources," said St. Vincent 
spokesperson Mark Tsuchiya . 
"Father Joe set out to provide all of 
the necessary resources for thcsc 
people, on-site, because this would 
be the only way for them to seek 
and receivc the help that they are in 
need of." 

With the holidays coming up, 
St. Vinccnt's has many festivities 
planned for its residents, including 
a traditional Thanksgiving mcal 
and several Christmas-related 
activities. For children likc Robert 
Stevenson, these activitics havc 
helped to sustain a sense of normal -
cy in the life of a young child who 
has experienced struggle first-
hand. 

While Robert has grown accus-
tomed to his living situation, hc 
still occasionally qucstiom how

mother will be able to cI,lim a

With a glcam in his eye and a

day come true. 

Stevenson recently found out 
that her soon-to-be-ex-husband 
had somehow snuck back into the 
country. Although it has been diffi-
cult for her to do, Stevcnson has 
not let him interact with Robert. 

"He's hurt his son enough and 
r really don 't need my son to get 
hurt anymore," Stevcnson 
claimed. "I'm not orry at all that 
he's not a part of our lives any-
more because I have gOt a better

18 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Water polo ends year 
Tritons win two but lose championship game to Loyola 
By COREY HOLMAN 

The UCSD men's water polo 
team advanced to the finals of the 
Western Water Polo Association 
Tournament, picking up two easy 
wins on Friday and Saturday. 

Last year, the Tritons captured 
the WWPA crown on their way to 
a national second-place finish 
behind powerhouse UCLA. 

In the quarterfinals , held at the 
Burns Recreation Center Pool at 
Loyola Marymount University, the 

o. 2-seed Tritons easily dis-
patched of seventrr-seeded 
University of La Verne 12-6 to 
advance to the semifinals. 

Up 6-2 at the half and 9-2 
after the third quarter, UCSD 
had few problems with La Verne. 
Matthew Ustaszewski, Clark 
Peter en, Jonathan Hopkins and 
se nior Co-Captain Jonathan 
Samuels all scored two goals to 
lead the Tritons. Goalie Lance 
Onken made four saves on the 
afternoon. 

Coming off the victory over La 
Verne, UCSD was flying high 
heading into a semifinal game with 
the University of Redlands. 

Samuels led the Tritons in scor-
ing with three goals helping his 
team to an 11-6 victory. The 
Tritons jumped out to a 5-2 lead

percentage of the money raised by 
the owners for their performance. 
A top player takes home a larger 
amount of the profit that the team 
makes because he produces more 
and "entertains" the crowd more. I 
don't think that it would be fair to 
pay the athletes only $100,000 per 
year and let the owners take home 
the rest. After all, the ath letes are 
the ones who generate the profit 
with their performances. 

As far as saying that paying the

these athletes are in phenomenal 
shape. Even the lard-ass linemen 
in foo tball pound away for 30 to 
40 mll1utes per game with small 
breaks. Chances are that an aver-
age joe off the street would not 
make it through a single game, let 
alone an en tire season. In other 
spons, these men and women 

push themselves to the limit day 
in and day out for entire seasons, 
something that an average person 
couldn't fathom . In addition to 
the shape that they are in, these 
athletes also handle the mental 
aspects of the game and perform 
at levels that we can only dream 
of. Athletes are truly special peo-
ple who deserve to be paid special 
salaries. 

When you look at it, athletes' 
sa laries can be put in perspective 
by looking at other industries. Top 
movie stars can make more than 
$20 million for a si ngle mo\~e that 
migbt take three months to shoot. 
As a result, movie ticket prices are 
now close to 10 bucks a sea t. You 
don't see people maki ng nearly as 
much of a stink about that as they 
do about professional athletes. 

In other words, stop your bitch-
ing about ticket prices and enjoy 
the top-notch athletes performing 
for you on the field . 

Because I said so. 

Congratulations 
to the new ladles 01

Men's team beats nine teams in NCAA Championships 
By KEITH DO 
Staff Writer 

. 1!1. its first time competing in a 
DIVISion II national event, the 
UCSD men's cross country team 
finished 15th at the 43rd annual 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Division U C ross 
Countty National Championships 
this weekend at Slippery Rock 
University in Pennsylvania. 

The field was composed of the 
top teams from the eight regional 
championships: East, Great Lakes, 
New England, North Central, 
South, Southeast, South Central 
and West. 

UCSD advanced to nationals as a 
result of its fourth-place finish at the 

CAA Division II West Regional 
Cross Country Championships, 
hosted by Western Washington 
University in Bellingham, Wash. In 
the national championships, the 
Tri tons finished as a team wi th 397 
total points. 

T he UCSD women 's team was 
unabk to compete because it need-

ed to fi nish in the top four teams in 
regional competition to advance to 
the national championship. The 
women finished 12 th out of the 21 
teams in the regional champi-
onship. 

Leading the Tritons in national 
competition was Alan Shapiro, who 
ran the 8-ki lometer course in 
33 :52. 1, finishing 6 1st out of 179 
competitors who represented the 
top 24 schools from around the 
country. 

John Morrison finished 76th 
and David Dunbar came in 94th to 
round out the UCSD runners in 
the top 100. Grant Guenther, Neil 
Kalra, Julian Nahan and Stephan 
Martin finished 1OIst, 106th, 125th 
and 152 nd, respectively, to round 
out the Tritons. 

Two-time defending national 
champions and first-ranked 
Western State College of Colorado 
won the event for the dlird year in 
a row with 38 points. It placed six 
of its seven runners in the top 22 , 
including champion Michael Aish, 
who finished the course in 30:52.6, 

and runner-up Joshua Eberly, who 
followed with 31 :34. Western State 
won the North Central Regional 
championships with its runners 
taking first through fifth place. 

Abi lene Christian University of 
Texas ranked second in the nation 
behind Western State, which fin-
ished with 74 points. Adams State 
College of Colorado, which fin-
ished runner-up to Western State 
in the North Central Regionals, 
rounded out the top three with 107 
points. 

The championships capped the 
Tritons' second yea r playing in 
Division U's California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Conference. 
The men's and women's teams fin-
ished third and fifth, respectively, at 
this year's CCAA championships. 

The men 's team was the CA1\s 
20th-ranked Division II team head-
ing into the season but fell out of 
the top 20 for the majority of the 
season. Due to a strong finish, 
however, the team ended up 19th 
when the fina l rankings came out in 
early November.

Tritons battle for convincing 2-0 victory 
UCSD beat Incarnate Word, may host semifinal game against Northern Kentucky University 
By JOSH CROUSE. 
Sports Editor 

The UCS D women's soccer team: You 
cannot StOP it, you can only hope to con-
tai n It. T hIS describes the 2001 NCAA 
Division II Women's Soccer Quarterfinals 
in which Incarnate Word of Texas con-
tained the Tritons for three-quarters of the 
game before UCSD's offense busted two 
goals to seal the deal. 

The Tritons defea ted the visi ting 
Crusaders 2-0 before a packed house at 
' Irlron Soccer Stadium Sunday night in the 
quarterfi nals of the NCAA C hampionships. 

"We'll take it," said UCSD head coach 
Brian McManus, referri ng to the team's -
win. "They came at us hard , but we were 
able to hold them off." 

The Tritons came out early and nearly 
stole a goal on the opening possession when 
the midfielder chipped the ball deep to 
senior forward Erika Alfredson, who just 
nussed the header past charging Incarnate 
\\'ord goalk.eeper Missy Howard. 

UC D kept the pressure on and haC! cht:

"1 tOld them to go out and play 10 min-
utes of solid soccer," McManus said. "We 
just needed to regroup. We had chances in 
the first half. We just needed to capitalize. 
Their keeper kept coming out - she was 
very brave. We juSt wanted to get in there 
and chip it past her." 

The players were feeling the frustration 
of missing the goals. 

"It does get a little frustrating to have 
chances to score and not be able to capital-
ize," Alfredson said. "We came out with 
determination in the second half and just 
wanted to put more pressure on them. We 
pressed a little more in the second half. " 

The teams played even through the first 
20 minutes of the second half before the 
Tritons' plan of attack finaU , ::.eared its fruit. 

Christi ne Wensel chip ,.d the ball at 
the net from 25 yards out despite the 
pleadings of McManus from the bench to 
drive the ball. As Howard charged out of 
the net to intercept the ball, Alfredson 
made a great play on the hall and chipped 
the ball past ti,e keeper fo r the goal.

opportunity as she scored the goal. 
"I remembered the last time I was down 

there in that situation and just thought that 
I needed . to get a little touch on the ball," 
Alfredson said. "I heard the goalie calling 
that she wanted the ball, so I just tried to 
chip it past her." 

The Tritons added another goal on a 
fantastic breakaway from Kristin Jones, 
.who beat two defenders and Howard to ice 
the victory for UCSD. Alfredson picked up 
the assist on the score. 

"That was as good a goal as you'll see 
under pressure," McManus said. 

Defense dominated the remainder of 
the game for the TritOns, who were led by 
California Collegiate Athletic Association 
MVP Julia Guder and sophomore keeper 
Kami P , who calT)e up with eight saves, 
including two crucial ones she deflected 
wide in the second hal f. 

Alfredson's performance was especially 
impressive, considerlllg the fact that she 
hadn't practiced sInce Nov. 14 and was still 
feeling the effects of the flu . 

"1 wa; a little nervous about my energy

sa id. "Once J j!Ot out the re the adrenaline 
stance( tlowlllg and I was okay." 

The hJd cnoed wi ~h th. tVl tealll~

During th ... inrennlsslOn, McManus

Junior Jennie Wilson added

"Western Washington came

Duncan ~cFarland. "They put a

game. vve struggled a little bit, but 
we workeC! hard and got back into

With the loss, the 24-5 Vikings

UCSD , on the other hand, 
advanced to Saturday'S Division II

The T ritons entered the final 
match on a seven-game winning 
<trea k and hoped to continue 
thei r succcs.s against the 29-2 
Coyotes. 

In front of a l,068-person 
crowd, UCSD battled with 
CSUSB for five games and ulti-
mately triumphed over the 
Coyotes ~- 2 With game scores of 
10-3 0, 30-26, 22-30, 31 -29 and 
17-15. 

Outside hitter Jennie Wilson 
stepped up for the Tritons and led 
UCSD with 21 kills, 21 digs and 
four blocks. Ohta accumulated 54 
assists, 11 digs, and three kills in 
the winning effort. 

On the other side of the net, 
Coyote senior setter Amy Pope 
had 60 assists and two solo blocks 
on the night. Sophomores Kim 
Ford and Kim ~orohunfola had a 
combined 38 kills in the five-game 
struggle. 

The fourth and fifth games 
proved to be incredibly compet-

W ith the free-agent frenzy 
about to begin ill 
Major League 
Baseball, the 
debate over the 
inflating salaries o · 
professional ath-
letes will once 
as,Wln resume. 

'-'rhe vast majority of fans 
believe that the salaries are out 
of control. They simply do nor 
understand whv owners contIn-
ue ro pay su<:h 'targe salanes and 
then pass the costs off to the fans 
in the form of higher ticket 
prices and S 1 0 hot dogs at the 
concession stand. I've often 
heard fans say that it is ridicu-
lous to pay people that much 
money for simply "playing a 
game." 

I am of a different opinion. 
While I think that salaries have 
risen to high levels, I think that 
they are, for the most part, justi-
fied. I think that the athletes 
earn the money that they 
receive. I do, however, have one 
problem with high salaries : 
They make it virtually impossi-
ble for small-market teams to 
compete for big-name free 
agents.
