The Campus Crusade for Christ broke AS Council rules two weeks ago when 
it advertised its forum on abortion . 

The AS Council gave the Crusaders 5235.80 in student money to sponsor the 
program. The Crusaders, a religious organization for Christian and non-
Christian students, have a twofold purpose: It provides a fellowship for 
Christian students and instructs Christian students in spreading the word of 
the Gospel. 

The Crusaders printed and hung Diers on campus that did nOl state that they 
were sponsoring the event. Also, the language of the posters was obscure in 
stating the contents of the program. This led some students to believe that the 
forum on abortion was going to be something other than what it was. 

The fliers advertised a film called Assignment: Life . They were blue, yellow and 
red posters that were hung on buildings, posts, signs, and bunetin boards on the 
Revelle campus, in the Student Center and in Mandeville Center. In the upper 
left hand comer of each flier was a picture of a fetus dropping into two hands. 
The film , the fliers stated , would "expose" abortion through the "authorities in 
the controversy ." Printed in large letters al the bouom of each flier was the 
statement: "The ramification would shake society." 

After receiving complaints about the crusade's program. AS Council Advisor 
Randy Woodard looked into the maner. 

"We cannot censor films," Woodard said , "so there is nothing wrong with 
their showing the film . We require, and expect, orgamzations who we fund to 
state who they are and what the contents of the event will be on all their 
advvertisements. This the crusaders did not do. 

"I talkeJ to Cindy and Berry, twO Crusader representatives, in my office ," 
Woodard continued . "1 took very detailed notes, which I usually don't do. 

"They admitted that the film 'did not balance both sides lofthe issue I,"' he 
said. "and that they should have stated expliCitly on the fliers that the film was 
anti -abortion ." Woodard also said thal "they realIzed that they were breakingAS 
rules when they hung the fliers without a sponsor's name printed on them." 

Of Ihe $235.80 funded to the Crusaders by the AS for the showing of 
ASSignment: Life , 5225.00 went for renting Mandeville AudilOrium , while $10.80 
went for advertiSing. 

A representative of the Crusade said that it needed the AS funds to sponsor 
the program. Mike Ebert, the student who brought the film to the campus, had 
already paid $85.00 for Ihe ftlm alone. "The Crusaders: Ebert added, "probably 
wanted to show a moral viewpoint of abortion ." 

It is the policy of the AS Council that the contents of events and their 
sponsors be clearly stated on the fliers that advertise upcoming events. In this 
case, Randy Woodard said, "I decided not to take action against the CCC 
except 10 monitor their events more closely in the future."

Doctor refutes statistics 
used in anti-abortion film 

The "curretage" part of D&C involves 
scraping the contents of the uterus, 
Kripke explained. If it is done too 
thoroughly, vital tissue is removed or 
scar tissue is created. This sometimes 
leads to the woman's inability to 
conceive again or (0 the egg remaining 
in the fanopian tube , she said. 

By KRISTIN DONNAN 
A doctor in the San Diego community 

refuted the "back-alley set of statistics" 
presented in the film AsSignment: Life 
which was shown on January 19th at 
UC5D by Campus Crusade for Christ. 

Mike Ebert, the Campus Crusade 
representative who brought the film to 
UC5D, was satisfied with its main 
messsage that abortion is murder. The 
validity of the material was questioned, 
but Ebert said that he would still show 
the film in the future. 

Moreover, after the screening, Ebert 
stated that the world's main problem, 
self-centeredness (of which abortion is 
an example), could be solved by 
accepting Jesus Christ. 

The controversy arose from both a set 
of statistics cited in the film and what 
seems to be a scare-tactic approach. 
These arguments were meant to 
convince viewers against abortion, but 
they were misleading due to 
inaccuracies in their presentation. 

Generally, the statistics have been 
found to be grossly outdated, if they can 
be thought accurate at aD, according to 
San Diego physician Z. Kripke , MD, 
MPH. 

The statistics deal with supposed 
risks a woman takes after she has had 
one induced abortion, an outdated 
practice. They state that during a 
second pregnancy, the woman has: 
twice the chance of miscarriage in first 
trimester; ten times the chance of 
miscarriage in second trimeS!er; twice 
the chance of a stillborn in second 
trimester; 400 to 800 times the chance 
of a tubular pregnancy; three times the 
chance of a premature child; and a five 
to ten percent of not bearing children 
again . 

The problem with these figures is that 
they are linked 10 one induced abortion. 
Dr. Kripke said that modern methods in 
abortion yield much better results, with 
"near three abortions" the ,division at 

which "statisticS go up ." 
Of the problems listed above, the 

miscarriage, stillborn and premature 
statistics are related to "cervical 
incompetence," Kripke said. This 
incompetence occurs because of the 
manual dilation necessaty for access to 
the uterus. Kripke mentioned that 
within the last few years, methods in 
this dilation process have been 
considerably "less traumatic" because 
srnaller instruments and thin suction 
tubes are now used. 

The other question arises because 
these statistics rely on certain 
vulnerabilities that are associated with 
outdated methods in abortion, Dr. 
Kripke said. One older method which 
she discussed is Dilation and Curretage 
(D&C). 

Kripke thought that the statistics 
presented in the movie that dealt with 
tubular pregnancy and fertility were 
probably drawn from old D&C 

Since D&C is not currently used, 
these last two problems are vinually 
nonexistent Also , it was D&C which 
demanded a wider opening of the 
cervix than today's suction methods do, 
so that cervical competence is now 
considerably less inhibited. 

Further inaccuracies were discovered 
in the "real" abortion that was shown in 
the film and in the viewings of aborted 
fetal matter. 

The instruments used by the doctor 
in the film do nOl seem to correspond 
with the most effective ones used in the 
suction abortions that compose over 
90% of all abortions performed, 
according to Dr. Kripke. 

The abortion shown did involve 
suction, but the dilation process was nOI 
the least traum.'!tic (and most used) one, 
and the suction lube was much larger 
than usual. Now, the tubes, caned . 
canulas, are the width of a pencil , 
Kripke said. 

Pictures of aborted fetal material were 
included in the film. Mike Ebert 
suggested that the pictures were

Off-campus renters Co~lec~ve bargaining 
can receive $60 credit legIslatIon authored 

If you were a renter last year you 
probably qualiiy for a $60 rebate from 
the California state government. This 
$60 is Renter's Credit and can be 
received for every year in which you 
rented by filing a state tax form . Renter's 
Credit is the state government's "thank 
you" to renters who contributed 
indirectly to the tax base . 

To qualify you must meet the 
follOWing requirements: you must have 
rented on March 1st, 1983; you must 
have been a California resident when 
you rented; the rental must have been 
on taxed property (which excludes 
campus housing); and the rental must 
have been the principal place of 
dwelling. 

Paying taxes is nOl a requirement to 
receive the rebate. Being claimed as a 
dependent on your parents' tax form is 
also not a disqualification . Renter's 

Credit is retroactive, enabling renters to 
receive credit for the four previous yea~ 
if they have not claimed in the past. 

Renter's Credit originated when there 
was a surplus in the state budget. 
Renters contribute to the property taxes 
through their landlords, yet the 
landlords receive the tax exemption . 
Therefore legislators decided renters 
should receive a tax break and a 537 
rebate was included in the state tax 
form. 

To receive Renter's Credit all one has 
to do is file a 540 or a 540A state tax 
form. If you are in need of a state tax 
form or have any questions on Renter's 
Credit CalPIRG will have tables on 
campus from II am to 1 pm, February 
13th to 17th for assistance. CalPIRG 
(Cahfomla Public Interest Research 
Group) hopes to mform people cr this 
olten-overlooked rebate .

Asemblymember Tom Bates (D-
Alameda) agreed to author legislation 
Tuesday wnlch WOUIO mandate 
collective bargaining rights for 
University of California student 
employees. 

Bates' decision to author the bill was 
a result of a meeting Monday between 
his aides, the UC Student Lobby and a 
Berkeley graduate student employee 
union , the Association of Graduate 
Student Employees. 

"He [Bates I recognizes that the 
student employees have a right to be 
represented under a collective 
bargaining agreement: Dion Aroner, 
Bates' legislati ve assistant, said. 

The legislation would authorize 
indiVIdual campuses to form graduate 
and undergraduate student employee 

unions, which would be formally 
recognized by the University 
administration and granted collective 
bargainislg rights. 

The bill would also clarify 
"ambiguous" language in the 1978 
Higher Education Employer-Employee 
Relations Act (HEERA). 

"The University has interpreted 
HEERA to deny student employees 
rights to collective bargaining," Helen 
Schwartz, executive commiuee member 
of AGSE, said. 

Although University administration is 
expected to fiercely oppose the bill, 
both the UC Public Information Office 
and the Syslemwide Lobby declined to 
comment on the bill until they had seen 
It.

AS and CCC show 
, -

mutual irresponsibility 
The recent funding provided by the AS for an anti-

abortion film and discussion presented by the 
Campus Crusade for Christ is in direct violation of 
campus poliCies regulating the allocation of activity 
fees, and reveals a lack of responsibility on the part 
of the AS, 

In a request form fileQ with the AS, the CCC stated 
that "the film itself is a 45-minute documentary 
dealing with medical ethics [of] abortion ... [that] will, 
be followed by a i5-minute talk whL::h will expand 
the topic from abortion to the basis for ethical 
choice." 

The AS based its decision to approve funding of 
the event solely on this statement without making 
any inquiries into the content of the film nor the 
planned line of discussion. As it turned out, the film 
presented only an anti-abortion view and the 
discussion that followed furthered the anti-abortion 
view and advocated Christianity. 

According to UC policies and regulations 
governing the allocation of activity fees, "no 
University funds [including AS monies] may be 
allocated ... to support these [religious or political] 
activities." The same policy explains that, "as the 
state instrumentality, the University must remain 
neutral on religious and political matters. The 
University cannot sponsor or fund religiOUS 
activities .. . except when authorized by the Regents ." 

Clearly, the funding of the CCC event is against 

the explicit policy of the University, Furthermore, the 
responsibility of determining which activities are 
eligible for funding under University policy belongs 
to the AS, and certainly, the distribution of student-
generated funds should not be done carelessly, 

For its part, the CCC displayed a lack of integrity 
by misleading the AS about the content and focus of 
the event in its budget request and by misleading the 
student body in its advertising. 

The AS asserts that content and sponsorship 
should be dearly stated on the Diers advertiSing an 
AS-funded event. However, the fliers distributed by 
the CCC failed to mention the sponsorship of the 
CCC and the biased nature of the presentation. The 
result was that many students were led to believe that 
the film and discussion would present both sides of 
the issue . They were further surprised by the 
presemation on Christianity which followed the film. 

Certainly, Campus Crusade for Christ (as well as 
every other campus organization) has the right to 
present its views, but should not misrepresent the 
focus or purpose of the events it sponsors. 

Because the AS and the CCC both failed to adhere 
to their responsibilities in this situation, the fault 
must be shared equally. 

In the future, it would be wise of the AS to be 
aware of the exact purpose of funding before it doles 
out st~dent-generated activity fees on the basis of a 
request.

Draft Dispute: 
A Legal Question 

The true story of 
Hiawatha and the boy 

By G.S. PERITZ 
The UCSD Guardian. for aU its effons 

to provide much needed and hard to 
get infonnation about the Selective 
Service and draft registration, is 
surprisingly unaware of the facts 
concerning the legal situations of the 16 
men so far indicted by the justice 
'Department for their refusal to register 
with the Selective Service. 

In an editorial by Guardian Editor Tim 
August, "Draft Registration in the land of 
the free?" (1/26), and in 'The UCSD 
Guide to the Selective Service" (1 / 26, 
.(0) by Contributing News Editor 
Christopher Canoie, statements made 
about the trials and disposition of 
cenain cases are incorrect and 
,misleading. 

Working with legal information 
prOVided by Colonel Ebel, assistant 
director of the Selective Service in 
Washington, D.C., the cases reponed on 
were referred to a!> "setbacks" in the 
Justice Department's prosecution of non-
registrants. It was implied that the trials 
(or in Sam Matthews' case, his release 
from prison) of these men have resulted 
in, or have been the results of, final 
rulings by the courts in favor of the 
defendants. This is not so. Indeed, three 
of the 16 cases could be caDed final, 
and have ended in convictions with 
prison time and alternate service for the 
defendants. 

The claim by Mr. August that "the 
chances of more than a few dozen 
(non-registrants) being prosecuted are 
quite smaU" is an erroneous assumption 
that suggests a false sense of security for 

draft registration resisters. Here in 
California, a state within the jurisdiction 
of the US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 
the chances of prosecution are in fact 
quite good. 

At present it appears more than likely 
that such cases wiu result in the 
convictions of the non-registrants. In 
the interest of proViding more accurate 
information, pal1lcularly for those young 
men who would risk prosecution for 
resisting draft registration, some 
clarifications are needed. 

David Wayre 's indictment in Los 
Angeles was initiaUy dismissed because 
of discriminatory prosecution. The 
appellate coun later reversed that ruling 
and reinstated the charges against 
Wayte. As it now stands, the couns wiu 
no longer dIsmiSS charges when the 
defense claims discriminatory or 
selective prosecution. The issue is now 
awaiting final review by the US Supreme 
Coun. 

In an Ohio case, Mark Schumucker 
was actually convicted of failure to 
register. On appeal, his case was sent 
back to the trial coun to conduct further 
hearings. Schumucker's case was not 
"reversed" as reponed, but is still active 
and awaiting a final decision by the trial 

. coun. 
In another Ohio case, Sam Matthews 

was also convicted of failure to register. 
He was sentenced to a one year federal 
prison term, which he staned serving. 
Due to a technical defect in his mal 
similar to the Schumucker case, he was

I love bicycles. I love bicycles in a 

dilTerent way Ihan most people who 
love bicycles love bicycles. Most of these 
people received their first bike while in . 
the crib, and have pretty much been 
eating, drinking and sleeping with one 
bike or another since then. They now 
own slick, streamlined "two-wheeled 
machines": aluminum beasts with every 
ounce of unnecessary weight lopped 01T. 
They don't belh:ve in kickstands or 
reflectors or lights or even cute little 
tinker-type bells on the handlebars; it's 
all extra weij(ht to them. 

These aficionados - hardcore 
bicyclists if there eve~ were any - can 
often be seen at stoplights, balancing 
their motionless bikes with their feet 
locked into the pedals. (Q: What do 
they do if a sudden sideways gust hits? 
A Fall .) With your window rolled down 
while waiting at the signal, you can hear 
them babble about the upcoming 
criterium, how they did at the 
Velodrome last night and who was 
ranked what in Senior Division. 

I am nOt one of these hardcores. I do 
not wish to belittle anyone who is: I 
think it 's fantastic that someone can get 
so into a hobby. No, really. 

I got my first and only bicycle on my 
eighth binhday. I was so happy. The 
bicycle and I became good friends over 
the next ten years. There was only one 
problem: the thing was a piece of crap. 

But it was my piece of crap. 
It was a metaUic green 26" threeÂ·

gear shift functioned properly for a total 
of eight days in the ten years the bike 
lived. But I didn't care. 

I think I was above two-foot-five on 
my eighth binhday. The top bar of the 
bike reached up to my ear. Dad 
attached a foam rubber seat directly 
onto the bar and put twoÂ·inch blocks 
on both sides of both pedals so that I 
could make a feeble attempt at riding 
this thing. You see, this was a bike I 
was going to grow into, not out of. 

And then we went through the dad-
teaches-kid-to-ride-bike ritual. Living in 
the country made this a little easier. 
Certainly it made it less embarrassing, 
since no one could watch me ("Gosh 
darn, Daddy, what the hell am I doing 
wrong?"). Also, falling face first into din 
is more pleasant than doing the same 
into asphalt. 

My binhday was in April. It was 
September before I could ride that thing 
on my own.

realized that there had to be a bener

In hiS editorial, Tim August has 
wrtnen that Ben Sasway was "denied a 
co nstitutionally guaranteed fait trial 
when the presiding judge refused to 
allow Sasway to testify on his own 
behalf." Presumably what Mr. August 
meant was that US District Judge 
Gordon Thompson Jr. did not allow 
Sasway to present certain testimony 10 
his defense that the judge ruled 
irrelevant to the definite issues of fact or 
of law to be rried . Mr. August claims that 
Judge Thompson "revoked Sasway's 
unalienable [sic] right of free speech" 
when he ordered Sasway not to speak 
about resistance' or on behalf of non-
registrants while his, case is on appeal. 
He fails to mention ~ Thompson's 
order was rescinded shortly after the 
trial when the US 9th Circuit ruled that 
it was not part of the conditions of the 
bad terms. 

On February 3, a federal appeals 
pancl of the US 9th Circuit Court 
upheld Ben Sasway's conviction in a 
ruling that defends the prosecution of 
resisters. The three-judge panel rejected 
Sasway's argument that the government's 
draft registration enforcement policy was 
unconsnrunonal and that Judge 

Thompson should have permitted 
Sasway to testify during the trial about 
his reasons for failing to register. Such 
testimony, the panel said, -was not 
relevant to the question of guilt or 
innocence." The panel bases its decision 
on the 9th Circuit's prior ruling on 
David Wayte's appeal. 

Mr. August has expressed his pro-
resistance stance which is his right, but 
hiS emotion has gotten the berer of him. 
The uansformation of fact for his own 
purposes precludes others from making 
sense when the utmost sense is needed . 
He unwittingly undercuts not only his 

.own position , but the very real and 
legitimate cause he passionately urges us 
to support. 

The point is that whatever moral 
rhetoric it may generate, draft 
registrarion is nothing if not a legal 
issue. Prosecution tS serious business 
and a federal felony conviction poses 
some grave consequences, not the least 
of which IS prison. The reports of 
Important precedent setting cases must 
be as accurate as possible if they are to 
be of any help to the young men faced 
with the decision of whether or not to 
register for the draft.

Not enough minorities to go 
around in faculty positions at UC 
By MICHAEL PARTOS 

The limited number of minoriry applicants available 
[0 fill facuhy positions and their uneven distributlon 
among academic disciplines are the two major 
impediments in efforts to increase the representatiton 
of women and minorities on the Untverslty of 
Califomia faculty. This statement came in a speech 
given to the Regents by UC Senior Vice President of 
Academic Affairs William R. Frazer at the Regents' San 
Francisco meeting on January 19. 

Said Lumpkin of affinnative action, "It has to be a 
process aimed at doing not a little bit for a whole lot 
of people . but a whole lot for a selected few." 

The following statistiCS are from the latest version of 
the UCSD Affirmative Action Plan (11/1 / 81- 10/ 31 / 82). 

Ranked against the other schools of the UC system, 
UCSD has the largest percentage of minority faculty 
(12.2%), followed by UC Santa Cruz (11.7%). It is 
important to nOle the imbalance between the SOCial 
and physical-bIOlogICal sCiences that eXists. For 
example , in the applied sciences at UCSD. there are 
121 male and four female tenured ladder-rank faculry 
members One hundred fourteen of these are white, 
ten are Asian and one IS Hispanic No Blacks or 
American Indians are tenured faculty members (The 
AcademiC Affirmative Action Office manages to claSSify 
all people IntO one of these five groups.) Out of the 
125 tenured facu lty members in the AMES, Economics, 
EECS, Psychology and Scnpps Departments, the only 
minority representatives are ten Asians and one 
Hispanic. 

Frazer claimed that, "UC is appOinting minorities 
and women to the faculty at levels higher than th eir 
availability in most fields." This is a deceiving 

Professor Lumpkin feels that barriers still exist for 
minorities. 'There is a large body of [faculty] resistance 
that feels that affirmative action has damaged the 
reputation of the University. and that altltude operates 
in both the appoi ntment and the promotion process .... 
There is a feeling that every minority faculty member 
has displaced some more quahfied non-minOrity 

latemem, because "availability" is based on the 
percentage of PhDs awarded to a particular minority 
for the given year. This means that "availability" can be 
infinite;;imal or even zero. For example , In 1981-82 no 
Mexican American and only one Black received a PhD 
in computer science in the US. 

faculty member. They [the faculty members I want to be 
convinced [hat thiS IS nm true , and it's an argument 
that you can't pOSSibly Win . There's always someone 
more qualified by some objecuve scale." 

Frazer noted that there are $500,000 in funds 
contained in the governor's 84-85 budget for new 
initiatives to increase the numbers of women and 
minorities available to fill faculty positions in the UC 
system. 

The initiatives include the Targets of Opportunity 
for Diversity Program. The program familiarizes faculty 
with available minority and female PhD candidates and 
helps develop recruitment techniques for those 
"targets." 

The problem with this kind of strategy is that not 
enough minorities make it into the position where 
they can be conSidered "targets ," or even make it into 
graduate schooL This is evidenced by the low 
availability statisrics Frazer cited In his speech to the 
Regents. 

Said Oscar]. Lumpkin , a Black physics professor at 
UCSD, "You can skip the pipeline at various points. If 
you look at the very end of the pipeline and nothing is 
coming out, well that's not a very big surprise when 
you've done nothing farther down the scale." Lumpkin 
feels the University ought [0 do more to recruit 
potential graduate candidates at the secondary level 
and then use the graduates as faculty. 

The LOtal number of ladder-ranked faculty at UCSD 
is 683: 604 male (88.4%), 79 female (11.6%), 599 
white (87.7%), 42 Asian (6.1 %), 20 Hispanic (2.9%), 
19 Black (2.8%), and 3 American Indian (0.4%). 

The AMES Deparment lIiustrates what is being done. 
All the ladder-ranked faculty members in the AMES 
Department are males. Of the 21 tenured faculty , [\\10 
are Asians and one is Hispanic - no females, Blacks 
or Amencan Indians. 

There were three searches and twO new 
appOintments made during the reporting period. 
Seventy people applied for the first position, 27 of 
whom (38.6%) were minorities. Of the four Individuals 
seriously conSidered, three were white and one was 
Asian The individual selected was a white male. He 
declined the offer. The second search resulted in the 
hiring of a male Asian. The third search resulted in the 
hiring of a white male. Five professors and one 
assOCia te professor, aU whae males, were granted mem 
advancements. and one white male was promoted to 
tenured rank. 

The University has used some form of student 
minoriry affirmative action for more than ten years, yet

Professor Lumpkin: "The faculty is generally not 
open to people who are different. I think it's 
conSciously or unconsciously cloning itself. It's not 
interested in the rype of collegiality that would come 
from people who are from a dlfferem culrural or

SPOTLIGHT ON 
Todd 
Jacobsen 

Todd Jacobeen it not your everyday avenae Revelle bookworm. ThOuah, with hit lilt of 
activities, you miaht expect him to be Joe over-achiever, or maybe a typical joclc, thiI iI far 
from the truth. Althoqh Todd it a 1er10U1 scholar, his extra-curricular activitiel are 
divene and he baa met with lP'est IUCcess in them. 

Todd it a lifeauard on campus, .. well as a Iwimming All-American and a water-polo 
pl.yer. Becau.e of thiI one miaht well expect a bronzed, empty headed .un aod, but thil 
isn't the CMe either. 

Todd it the leader of one of UCSO'. moat popular punic banda, the Insolent.. He .tarted 
thia .. a creative releue, and does it for fun, but even 10 the bmd has met with .~, 
pl.yinlat many UCSD functiona in the puc ye8r. Since Todd ilinvolved in the punk 
mUlic 1Cefte, you miIht imaIine him with multi-colored hair (or no hair at all) but Todd it 
a atardintly normallookinllUY. He defies any of the atereotypes he could be expected to 

. fit becauIe of au. echool, hit mUliaaI taate or his athletic abilities. 
Althoulh there don't aeem to be too many areu of activity left for Todd to explore, he 

does intend to branch out into the alkampua politicallcene, and reportedly has his eye on 
a major political paRdon for next year . Todd declines commenting on thiI rumor, 
althouth he does exsn- the view th8t " .. .1 UIed to be 10 apathetic -10 if I can tel involved, 
anyone can get involved." 10 which a fellow team member .rudely adds "yesh - if Todd 
could do it, 10 could any corpae." 
. Todd anributes hiI aucceu to ItrOlll family ties. He hopei to meet with more of it, 

ellpedally on the political acene. He certainly could do a lot to disprove the unkind 
atereotype of "nerd" liven to Revelle .tudenta, and it would be intereatintl to lee what sort 
of a leader Todd would malee. The only thina you can really predict about Todd it hiI 
unpredictability, ~ if he meea with the aame .uccesa in the political field that he baa met 
with in the pool and with music, he may be a .ure thina for AS whatever.

Thl! Rl!Vclll! Talent Show, organizoo by RA's Ikn Deckl!f and Teresa RUdolph, was a 
smashing success this year as the 12 acts boogied, strummed, and sang their hearts out. 

Though it was a tough decision, the judges awarded a 3rd. placl! tie to Joe Shinner! and 
Steve Rotblatt, both guitarists, 2nd place to dancers Cindy Tsujimara and Jocelyn 
Vodovoz, and first place to guitarist Chip Lynn. 

Thl! I!vming was sponsoroo by HPA and I!mcel!d by Jeff Orlin.ky. The talent displayed 
at the talent show just goes to show that Revelll! students can do more than study 
humanities.

Maria Mayer, independently and 
simultaneously, found the correct 
explanation. Maria Mayer did so with 
the help of Ennco Fermi , and found an 
explanation for the "magic numbers" as 
she called them. Suess, who had found 
additional slgl1lficance to these â€¢ 
numbers, discus cd mailers with his 
phYSicist fflend Hans Jensen who 
mdependently suggested the same 
explamltlon in Germany that Fermi 
suggested in Amrn a. Jensen then 
helped Suess With a completely new 
principle m nuclear physics, that of a so 
called spin-orbit couplIng, also called 
the Mayer-Jensen coupli ng. In 1950 
Ma)'er and Jensen shared a obel prize 
111 physics for this Idea. Such fi nds 
come only oncc in a lifetime, if at all. 

Dr. Suess did work all uramum to 
prevent ocmg drafted by Nav GenllaPlJ. 

When asked about a pOSSible end to 
scientific study, Suess commented, 
"People will never stop seeking 
explanations for nature. Nevertheless, 
science could end, but so would many 
other thmgs." 

Suess relates a story about a claSSified 
seminar given , he thinks, by Edward 
Teller in Chicago 111 I 950. He was not 
allowed to atte nd it, but after the 
seminar Harold Urey remarked to Suess 
that the only really Interesting thing he 
had leamed was that most of the sun's 
energy came from hydrogen burl1lng 
and not from the "carbon-nitrogen 
cycle" as had been thought previously. 
Suess Iatcr realIzed that [he seminar was 
about fUSion . It seemed to him that Urey 
did not find the practical appli aton of 
thiS knowledge worth hiS conSideration; 
the sun appeared mu h more II1terestlng 
to him. 

" clence IS a random walk," explained 
Suess. It rakes t line and money and 
honest}' to make sCience progress. Suess 
pointed out a problem: 'There is much 
emphaSiS placed on publishing one's 
works. If someone makes a 
measurement, for example, and thmks 
that hiS result has only a 5% change of 
being correct, he may still be inclined to 
publish it. He does so because he 
knows that If he wins this gamble, he 
may hit the Jackpot 111 scienlific 
prestige. If he loses and his findings are 
wrong then this will be forgotten and 
WIll not do him any major harm in his 
career. Unfonunately too many people 
gamble in thiS manner, as it may rake 5 
years or more before these findings may 
be found correct or wrong." This 
gambling makes the "random walk" to 
find the truth more lengthy. Suess hopes 
that young researchers will be honest 
with themselves. Dishonesty should be 
viewed much more critically than it IS 
today.

(across from the Pub) 

water polo season? 
I think, probably, the high point was 

having such a tremendous group of 
freshmen . It was really exciting to see a 
whole new group coming in because for 
a while I was really concerned that we 
were never going to replace people like 
Toby Raymond , Willy Morris and Dan 
Crane, then all of the sudden here 's 
Larry Sanders, Jerry Wisdom, Joe Wade 
and Duncan Millar. I could see that we 
were insuring the fact that we were 
going to have three or four more years 
of really excellent water polo. 

What was the low point of last season? 
It was probably realizing that this 

year's team was not gomg to be able to 
do II agamst the top ten teams like 
USC, UClA, Irvine, etc_ We slarted the 
season 0-7 against these teams. It was 
discouraging and I think that It was 
difficult to finally realize that this was 
not going to be the year for us to get 
IntO the tOp ten. Although Western 
Regionals was our main goal, still it was 
hard to see Mike [Bolden I have to suffer 
through it. It was hiS last year and, of 
course, he wanted to go Out as being a 
member of the best Triton team ever. It 
just wasn 't going to happen. But this 
whole last-year was really just to gam 
experience and get ready for '84. 

What was your final ranking? 
13th. behind Brown and in front of 

Air Force_ 
For your end of the season awards, you 

gave two MVP uwards and two M1P 
awards. Who were they to and why did 
they receive the awards? 

The MVPs were Bill Kazmierowicz 
and Dana Greison . The MIPs were Joe 
Wade and Jerry Wisdom. The team 
voted for the awards and both were 
dead ties. For the MVPs I Â£hough It was 
perfect. Billy was our most consistent 
player all season long, especiaDy at the 
defensive end. He's a phenomenal 
player. Dana represented the -flashy -flare 
at the ofTensive end. If we hadn't had 

his play at Western Regionals, we would 
have been in trouble. He was the 
ofTensive punch. 

What are your goals for the team? 
Well, we want to crack that top ten 

again . I don 't think there is any 
question about that. Yet, we don't make 
cracking the top ten our number one 
cmenon, but It is very important. I 
think we should be shooting to beat 
those teams. We all want to get back in 
there like the '81 team was. Clearly, 
we've established ourselves as a very 
fme program_ We're competing at a 
really great level right now, but we're not 
winning the games that we really want 
to. Personally, I'm getting a Iitcle tired of 
It. We generaUy have twO or three games 
every year where we have a menial 
breakdown and I have to sit there while 
we get pummeled . We have to develop 
much more consistency. For example

Are you happy here al UCSD or would 
you rather coach at a Division I scholarship 
school where you might get better pay and 
more consistent players? 

I am reaDy happy here at UCSD. My 
position here has put me in a situation 
where I am able, from a financial 
standpOint, to make what other Division 
I coaches make. So tha(s no longer an 
issue like it used to be . The issue 
becomes; would you rather be at a 
Division I school where you would have 
scholarships to buy kids Jeft and right? 
That guarantees you from year to year 
that you're going to have a good team. 
But I don't think that I would care to be 
in that situation. I've always been [he 
type of person that enjoys being an 
underdog and having a challenge. Every 
game that we play is terribly exciting to 
me because generally we're underdogs 
and I enjoy that. So my answer is that I

"'PORT~ 

UCSD cages the lifeless Cougars 
By MIKE GREENBERG 

Football analyst and Lite Beer 
historian John Madden would have 
loved last Tuesday night's basketball 
game - not because UCSD trounced 
Azusa Pacific for the second time this 
season. 85-59. but because there were 
more grums and gags than in your 
typical Cowboy-Redskin contest. From 
the three-minute mark of the second 
half up 10 its conclusion. officials AI 
Thomasson and Jim Gilchriste let an 
already physical game get way out of 
hand - so much so that it was 
surprising that no blows were thrown, 

With only eight minutes left in 
regulation and the TrilOns firmly in 
command. Cougar guard Phil Fogg tried 
10 get inside the jersey of UC~D reserve 
Jack Bloom the hard way - head first. 
As Fogg was giving Bloom a half-nelson 
(probably out of frustration) Thomasson 
and Gilchriste looked the other way. 
While Greg Kamansky was being 
introduced to the Pavilion floor, 
attempting a reverse layup, Stan and 
Ollie were nowhere to be found. When 
Kendall Berkley's collarbone saId hello to 
Mike Dabasinskas's forearm , play 
virtually came to a halt, evel)'one 
expecting the call that would never 
come. Games like this give mEre 
credence 10 those who say basketball 
players should wear shoulder pads. 

Nevertheless, in probably their most 
blase effolt of the year, the T rilOns 
raised their record in the league 10 3-5, 
two games out of the Southern Division 
lead. Afterwards, head coach Tom 
Marshall was vel)' enthusiastic. despite 
being stricken with a 102Â° fever that 
made the usually overzealous sideline 
patrolman a little more subdued. "I'm

delighted with the team's play. Even 
though we started out a bit sluggish, we 
woke up when it counted," said 
MarshalL 

UCSD's alarm clock did not go off 
until ten minutes Into the first stanza. 
By then , the score was 21-19 Tritons, 
and the tempo was clearly being 
dictated by the Visitors. But UCSD 
proceeded to score the next ten points 
and 13 of 15 to break a close game 
wide open, leading at intermission 34-
2L "When we play like we did tonight 
and last Friday night against Point 
Lorna, we can beat anyone." said 
forward Mark Barreca, who was the 
game's leading scorer with 17 points. 
"That Spurt at the end of the first half 
was typicaL When we put it all together, 
this team can be vel)' good ." 

The final twenty mmutes did not star 
a T rilOn or a Cougar, they were merely 
supporting characters for a striped 
shirted version of The Odd Couple. 
Asked if he was concerned about the 
poor offiCiating which provoked fights 
and thereby jeopardIZed one of his 
players to injul)'. Marshall quipped, ''I'm 
never concerned about that, are you 
kidding? I've got Dabo." 

Dabo. of course, is shon for 
Dabasinskas. a 6'8 H â€¢ 265-pound bull who 
does not give an inch to anyone. "They 
I the officials I let the game get out of 
control." said the junior, who might 
become the first player ever at UCSD 10 
play aU four years if he decides 10 
participate next season. "I didn't think it 
was any more physical than the Point 
Lorna glIme. it was jUst more obvious to 
the crowd because many obvious calls 
weren't made."

For the 80 or 90 fans who decided to 
forego their studies 'and make the trek 
to the Pavilion. they saw their team 
demonstrate that it clearly has the 
capabilities to advance far in this year's 
playoffs. For the second time in as 
many outings, UCSD shot over 50% and 
committed twice as few turnovers as its 
opponent. In fact. in their last two 
contests. UCSD is shOoting 54% while 
commlUing a combined 20 turnovers. the 
same per game figure that the club has 
averaged all year long. 

Tonight, the Tritons face LA Baptist 
in what looks like a mismatch. UCSD is 
playing at its peak. while LA Baptist has 
one win to show for their efforts in 
District play. A victolY tonight would set 

up a showdown with Southern Cal 
College Tuesday night for the rights to 
the home court advantage in the 
playoffs. "The way we're playing. 1 don't 
see how we can lose to LA Baptist or 
sec," said UCSD's skipper. "All we have 
to do is play like we are capable of and 
everything will be fine." 

TRITON HOOP-lAH: Freshman Greg 
Kamansky, UCSD's leadingJicld goals shooter 
at 54.3% had another fine outing. threading 
the ntts for 16 points. 11 in the first half when 
the Tritons netded a lift . Kamanslly was 
recent!y named "District Player of the Wet . .... 
becoming the first freshman this year and the 
first eycr in the NAJA District III to be given 
such an honor. 

Tritons back in the race 
The Southern Division of the NAJA District \U Conference tightened yesterday 

because of victories Tuesday night by Cal Baptist (over Southern Cal College) 
UCSD (over Azusa Pacific) and Point lorna (over Fresno Pacific). With five 
league contests remaining, here is how the division pans out: Point loma (5-3). 
sec (4-4). Cal Baptist (4-4). UCSD (3-5) and Azusa Pacific (3-5). 

The Tritons' next three opponents, LA Baptist. seC. and Cal Baptist are 
critical since only the top two teams in each division retain the home-court 
advantage. With three consecutive victories. UCSD would leapfrog from the 
seventh pOSition into the fourth, good enough to bring the first round playoff 
game to the Triton Pavilion. 

Other NAlA news - Biola defeated Westmont, the nation's number one 
ranked team 67-65 Tuesday to move into a tie for first place in the Northern 
Division. Both tearns are 7-l and have all but secured the home court advantage 
in this year's post season action .... LA Baptist notched its first victory of the 
season in league play with an impressive 73-61 over Cal Lutheran. LA Baptist 
had four players in double figures and played a very aggressive man to man 
defense that stifled the usuaDy high powered Cal Lutheran offense. LA Baptist's 
next opponent is UCSD, tonight in the Pavilion at 7:30 pm.

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVAGE 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Greg Kamansky is like a kid in a candy store 
these days. The freshman from Arcadia is having the time of his life playing guard for 
the Triton basketball team."1 look forward to practice every day. Sometimes I just can 't 
wail for practice. I guess its just being with the team." To run and sweat through two 
hours of drills and actually look forward to doing it is some kind of enthusiasm. E4ther 
the kid is overly enthusiastic or he has 
a problem. Greg Kamansky does not 
have a problem. At least. he has not had 
one for a while anyway. After spending 
much of [he season in a reserve role, 
Kamansky was Insened mto the startIng 
lineup by head coach Tom Marshall 
three games ago. "I've put him m the 
toughest sltuallons and he's come 
through evel)' time ." explains Marshall. 
"Greg has proven all year that he 
deserves this SpOl Istarting guard I." 
Okay, so the kid cracks the starting 
lineup as a freshman . Big deal . Now it is 

tim~ to produce. Kamansky's first start is 
on the road against Cal Lutheran. The 
Tritons lose 84-80. but Kamansky scores 
a career high 21 points. Maybe he 
didn't feel much pressure after aU. But 
he certainly will when the Tritons host 
Point Lorna Nazarene. UCSD, with a 1-5 
record, faces a must-win situation. Point 
Loma is the division leader, and it's 
Spirit Night in the Pavilion with 700 
screaming fans. That's l.400 eyes 
watching Greg Kamansky every time he 
touches the ball. When he walks OntO 
the court for the opening tip-off. his 
knees should be shaking like the fault 
line through San Andreas. Not so. 
Kamansky lights up the scoreboard with 
17 points along with five assists as the 
Tritons pull off an 80-74 upset win . Ip 
his two games as a starter. the kid 
scores 34 points, dishes out eight assists Greg KCIIllansky - a natural for installt success. 
and earns the NAlA District 1\1 Play'er-of-

It was 1984 (an OIympicyurln caseyou'w been on Mars brthe pal fEwyars). and 
the motivation to return to the swtrnmlng pool to sec where he stood In US swimming

In the short span al four weeks. ((azmierow!cz has established himself lIS a real and 
dellnlte threat to the NCAA record book. HIs incredible early season s~art earned him 
unanimous support br January's UCSDIBucb.I â€¢â€¢ AIbIeeI oI'the Month A..-d. 

AI the conclusion allast week. lfazmlerowk:z had the wry mtcst times In the nation 
In NCAA-DMsIon ID In three separate evenls (200 FlU. 500 Free. and the 200 individual 
Medley) with his recent 1:55:66 performance aQalnst San DIcQo State setting a new 
UCSO school mark In the 200 1M by almost 2 scconds, 

Add1tlonally. BID has the nalion's second fastest time In the 50 fIft (46.84) and has 
been a solid anchor and lead-of swimmer In UCSO's nationally ranked freestyle and 
medley relay teams. 

"Billy's early-season contribution to our team has been just tremendous." says 
Morgan. "He has assimllated swtmminil trainlnil so easily and quickly coming of the 
polo season .. .if 5 just amazing. And as far lIS being areal contributor to the team concept 
that we are trvtniI to build here".weD. you just couldn't ask for anything more." 

Morgan goes on. "The funny thlnills. BW still isn't even close to what he reaDy can 
accomplish this season. Hey. it's really early in the season. and he's swlrnmini some 
incredible stuff. Check back with us in mid-March around nationals time. and these 
marks may be an dent history." 

Kamansky. finds center stage an easy act 
the-Week honors. Unbelievable. But wait. The freshman is really in for a fall 
now. Opposing teams are going to start paying more attention to him. and on top of 
that . he's probably getting cocky. Not a chance. In his third game as a starter, 
Kamansky pumps in 16 points and UCSD routs Azusa Pacific 85-59 to get back into 
the District 1\1 Southern division race. You would think that by this time Kamansky 
would begm to feel confident in keeping his new role as a Triton starter. Not Greg. "I 
can't think that I'm in the starting lineup for good . I've JUSt got to take it one game at a 
time and see what happens." Greg Kamansky will see what happens tonight. when 
UCSD hosts LA Baptist College in Triton Pavilion at 7:30 pm. And you can be sure that 
when the kid goes through that candy store tOnight. he will not just be browsing 
around . 

WAIT A MINlJfE DEPT. The US Football League is certainly going all out with big 
com to lure NFL'ers away and add credibility to their league. Even though they have 
reeled in quite a few stars from their rival league. it looks as though they have let the 
biggest prize get away. Last month . when the Chicago Blitz offered Walter Payton a $2 
million-a-year contract. the)' figured it was enough bait to land him. But according 10 
his agent. Bud Holmes. Payton isn't biting. He is going to stay with his current team. 
the Chicago Bears. for three more years. When I first heard this. I found it rather odd. 
Obviously the NFL is more prestigious than the USFL and most players would prefer to 
remain in the established league. But hey, twO million dollars is two million dollars. I'd 
play football surrounded by gunfire in El Salvador for two million dollars a year. The 
Bears would not offer him a contract like that. And they didn't It turns out they 
offered him more. The Bears offer reportedly is structured to pay Payton nearly a 
quarter of a million dollars a year for the rest of his life. Just think, ten years or so from 
now, when Walter Payton is out of football and all he will be doing is touring the 
world or lounging in front of the television set on Sundays, watching Eric Dickerson 
close in on his all-time rushing records. he'U still be drawing nice weekly paychecks to 
the tune of five grand. Not too much to worry about. eh Walt? Or is there? I do not 
want to scare you fella , but I wonder about thIS lifetime comract bUSIness. That means 
when you are no longer around . there IS no more comract. The commitment ends wl!h 
your life . I wonder how hard up for cash the Chicago Bears will be ten or fifteen years 
from now. Isn't [he Mafia based In Chicago? Sure, you've taken a lot of licks throughout 
your years in football , but you'd beller not leave yourself vulnerable to getting hit by 
one man tOo many.

14 February 9, 1984 

According to one, 
hockey is clean after all 
To jeff Savage, Spons Editor: 

In response to your anicle in the 
Guardian on January 30, I would lake to 
express an alternative opinion. Just 
because the Montreal Canadiens have 
hired a boxing coach does not mean 
that he will teach boxing to the players. 
Everybody knows that boxers are in 
better shape than most other athletes. 
This fact is evident to anybody who saw 
Roclly. Why then does it seem so 
strange that the Canadiens hired a 
boxing coach? You seem to 
automatically reject the possibility that 
Mr. Drouin was hired merely tQ improve 
the shape of the players. JUst because 
Mr. Drouin evaluates the players in 
boxing terms does nO! mean that he will 
be teaching them boxing. Mike Milbury 
of the Boston Brui ns IS a black belt in 
karate , so why did nO! the Canadiens 
hire a mania I ans instructor? 

The National Hocke), League does nOt 
necessarily advocate fighting as you 
suggest. The five-minute penalties to 
which you refer are the mmimum of the 
fighting penalties. You have forgonen to 
mennon the fines and/or game-
misconduct penalties. At any rate , 
should Mr. Drouin decide to teach the 
proper fighting techniques to the 
Canad ie ns, he Will follow the path of 
one of the coaches of the Rochester 
Americans (a NHL farm learn). The 
coach was fi ned and severely 
reprimanded for lecturing his players on 
the an of fighting. 

The teams In the NHL have already 

learned an imponant lesson about 
righting: talent always overccmes 
brutality. For example, how many times 
have you seen Wayne Gretzky in a 
fight? Mr. Gretzky, the most talented 
player in the NHL today, has won the 
Lady Byng trophy for being the best 
sportsman in the league . Teams have 
had their enforcers, such as Nick Fotiu 
of the New York Rangers (a golden 
gloves boxer), but they are seeing 
decreasing amounts of ice lime. 

In nine years of playing hockey, and 
only having seen one right in that lime, 
I was shown something about the 
frequency of fighting in hockey. Now, as 
we speak, hockey great Bobby Orr is on 
a campaign to eliminate fighting in 
youth hockey. In most minor leagues 
and youth programs, automatic 
suspensions are in order for any playe rs 
who right . If such actions are being 
taken to elIminate fighting in mmor 
league hockey, I tend to believe that the 
NHL is not condoning fighting. These 
lighting countermeasures appear to 
contradict your view of hockey's future. 
The players in the minor leagues are the 
future of the NHL. Preventing these 
players from fighting will mean that 
future HL teams will consist of the 
players you say will be serving penalty 
minutes for losing fights. In my opimon, 
Mr. Savage. you have let your 
Imaginallon run wild instead of looking 
at hockey realistically.

am quite pleased to be here and dealing 
with 25-30 student athletes that have 
chosen UCSD because they want to be 
here . I dora't have to deal with students 
who are just here for the scholarship . 

Some Itams have complained Ihal UCSD 
is always an underdog. Does being an 
underdog ever become 100 much Jor you? 

We aren't an underdog all of the time. 
Our schedule is set up so that eve!)' 
year we are going to get a decent 
amount of wins. Yet we still have an 
opponunity to play tOP level teams. 
Should we be able to defeat some of 
them, then that's our ticket to gening 
into the NCAA (Division I 
championships). Our schedule is son of 
a blend of top level teams and other 
teams that should be close to a par with 
us. It is fun though to be on the other 
side of the fence as we were at Western 
Regionals (UCSD was the tOP seed). The 
players have to learn how to win games 
that they should . They have to know 
what it's like to win. But we are just a 
few players away from beating those top 
teams . We already dominate some 
Division 1 teams like Fullenon. We 
know that we can wm. This last season 
we learned what our mistakes were and 
how to correct them so now we come 
back in the spring and summer to 
hopefully put it aU together for 84. 

Does coaching ever become too stressful 
or emotional for you? 

When I !irst staned coaching, I had a 
lot of trouble detaching what was 
happening in the water and what was 
happening in my storrtach. I was a very 
emotional person and I still am. But I 
am now able to cut down on the stress 
factor. I don't know how I did it. I think 

I just realized that it is JUSt a game and 
that wins and losses don 't have that 
much of a ramirication on the world. I 
realized that I am really here to just 
make sure mat the students that come 
through here have a positive experience 
and have something to look back on 
aside from the wins and losses. 

What .do you see as your job in ils 
aspects towards your studtnt arhe/elts and 
the sport? 

I've always said it's not so much the 
wins and the losses, but Ihe friends that 
you acquire . To me that really is an 
important issue . I can already see with 
this last year's group that in a very shon 
time they have already established close 
relationships with each other. If mey 
stick together they are going to become 
such tremendous friends that they will 
create a bond that will carry i 010 me 
water. That's what happend with the '81 
team. It JUSt makes for successful water 
polo. But to get back to the question, 
the rrtain thing is for me to provide as 
high a level of water polo that I can 
give. Right now I think that we 're tops. I 
am working my tail off just as hatd as 
those Division I clowns Icoachesl. If 
anything, I think we're doing a bener 
Job. I Ii ke to think c,f us as one of the 
more progreSSive programs in the 
country. Number one is to provide the 
opponunity for the players. Number two 
is to make sure that I can pass the 
philosophies about friendship, loyahy, 
camaraderie and things like that. 
Because it isn't JUSt water polo, it's your 
whole university experience. At many 
other schools it's just your spon and you 
don't have time for a social life or even 
in some cases, academics. To me water 
polo is only pan of an overall 
experience. 

TEAM OF THE WEEK 
Essence 

BMketball 

"Dynasty" may not be the most accurate word to describe this team, 
but, judging from Essence's dismantling of Legal but Not Lethal Monday 
night, it may be the closest. Sure, they're newcomers to the league, and it 
was only their second game, and 1M Women's Basketball only has eight 
teams altogether - but to win 47-16 against a decent opponent? Come 
on. Okay, so "dynasty" still may not be appropriate; maybe Miller Tearn-
of-the-Week will put things in better perspective. Despite being in foul 
trouble, Rene Davis led all scorers with 17 points, one more than Legan 
but Not Lethal's entire point total. Jan Martin was next with 11 points. If 
Essence continues to dominate in this fashion, they may want to consider 
challenging the Men's Basketball Champion after they take the Women's 
Championship.

We used to think most UCSD 
students were bright and highly 
organized individuals. That must 
have been last year ... because if the 
1984 IM Basketball season is any 
indication, UCSD's longÂ·standing 
tradition as a top academic 
institution is in peril. 

Let's face it. .. how difficult is it to 
go to the Intramural team captain's 
meetings early in the quarter and get 
signed up in the appropriate league? 
Easy you say, huh? Yah, right...Mike 
and Scott put the leagues on the 
board ... AAA, AA, A, Coed ... and then 
you all fall neatly into line, sign your 
teams up, and then" we play 
ball... right? 

No, no, no! ... you guys are missing 
the point. When are you really going 
to get smart and demand that the 1M 
Czars start offering appropriate 
levels of competition. Forget this 
Triple, Double A jazz. Give us some 
leagues that we can really relate to. I 
mean silly. Since when does it make 
any sense to put the Butt Uglies in 
the Kyle Macy League. I mean Butt 
Ugly is obnoxious. They should have 
SIgned up for the Obnoxious league. 
And the Hack Bro . What are they 
domd in the Mike Dunleavy League. I 
mean there's a league already formed 
for them ... the Klutz League. And 
then there's the fraternities . When 
are they all going to find their way 
into the same league. Heck, there's 
enough of them, yet they all seem to 
avoid each other like the plague. 

Oh well . fret not, a quick runÂ· 
through of the 90 or so 1M Basketball 
teams this quarter will Quickly tell 
you that almost half of 'em gol SIgned 
up in the wrong leagues. 

And just to prove his point, the 
Budman has graciously volunteered 
to clear up all of the conf~sion. In the

Art as enlightenment 
By JA. IllAnoSOl'l 

rtom the beginning of time. man has recorded and expresaed 
hlmsdf In relation to his environment. The ablllty to Illustrate 
through pictorial mans preaged the spoken word, This self-
awareness made It possible for man to visually portray what he felt 
by depicting what he saw, 

f.arly man created visiOM and object.. whkh were expressions of 
his essential nature, Paleolithic cave paintings and rock reliefs 
show primitive man to be so attuned to himself In nature that he 
could render. wtth sophistication and Intelligence. volume. mass. 
proportion. perspective and linear design, this abUlty to 
communicate man's Innate awareness of ulstence naturally and 
without effort Is the state of consciousness a small number of 
artists are trying to regain, 

Throughout the ages, "art" has been created to explain. enhance 
and be an Integral part of Ufe through ritual and decoration, In 
modem society. what Is called art Is kept In Institutions In hushed 
reverena apart tom man's ewryclay Ufe. this Is art for art's sake 
and functions outside of society u an added bonus for thOle who 
have the means and Idsure to pursue vlsual grati8catfon for profit 
or cultural status. The function of this art Is one of escape. not of 
Integration, , 

Starting wtth Duchamp and his ready-mades. attempts to bring 
art back Into Ufe through the media of earth art. conceptual art and 
performance art installations, environmental art and the living of 
Ufe u the work of art Is the beginning of the reintegration of art 
Into Ufe. 'I1Ieae methods are steps in the development of a new 
consciousness In the way man views art. this Is the ~ of an 
article written by Alan Kaprow (a UCSD profeator). published In the 
December Issue 01 An 'orum. 1be role of the Ilfdlke art u 
exprested by Kaprow Is one of cUred: Involvement with the 
awareness of Ufe to bring about self-knowledge through pmonal 
growth. 

With this new awaaalt:SS. the meaning of the word art wtll change 
from bdng an end to being I means. from holding out I promise of 
perfection In some other reabn to deII10Mtrating a Wly of living 
meaningfully In thlsone.1bere Is proofthatmanmayregaJn his art

Tbree O'clock and all's well for LA. quartet 
8y RODDY 80GAWA 

These days, the label of "pop" 
music brings to mind a certain 
distaste to the average record 
buyer. Many think of pop music 
as the bands they "used to like 
before they sold out." and the 
unhlp gold and platinum 
albums of American bands such 
as RtO Speedwagon and 
Journey. There Is, however, a 
new, growing trend among local 
bands, with the freedom 
provided by Independent record 
companies. Local bands are 
moving towards the ideals of 
pop music of the sixties, and are 
on the verge of landslide 
success that bands such as the 
Monkees enjoyed. 

experimenting with hOl115 and 
synthesizers, a choice which has 
led to mixed reactions. 

While much of the band's 
hardcore following has 
crIticized the use of 
synthesizers as "seiling out." on 
the other extreme, critics and 
reviewers have pigeonholed the 
band as sounding too much like 
a cross of The Lemon Pipers and 
The Strawberry Alarm Clock. 
Because of this dlffmnce of 
opinion and the ftckJe nature of 
listeners, Querelo feels that. 
"fveryone has their own 
opinion, so you can only trust 
yourself." and that the band 
would much rather play to kids 
and people who are more Into 
the music rather than simply 
getting dressed up. 

One such band which has 
been on the spearhead of LA's 
music scene is The 11'Iree 
OÂ·Clock. Undeniably drawing 
from numerous bands of the 
sixties, The Three O'Clock has 
surpas<>ed the inHuences of this 
pop era, and has become a major 
influence upon the local music 
scene. The group has also stirred 
up interest In other bands from 
what reviewers have described 
as a "nro-psychedelic revival " 
in Los Angeles. 

&'lng stars tile 11Iree O'doc:k wUl pIIIy with tbe Odds .ad n~ ]9] Saturday .... t la tile Rec. Gym. 

While It Is true that pop 
music In the sixties went hand 
In hand with fashion of the 
times. The Three O'Clock has 
proven that its music Is Its 
strength. Tracks such as 
'Tomorrow," "Jet fighter," and 
"A Day In f,rotlca" demonstrate 
just how slgnlftcant the band 
has become. In keeping sixties-
pop touches without oblivious 
acid-rock Indulgences, The 
Three O'Clock has put an 
Irresistible batch of songs 
together which transcends any 
constrictive label of Its music. 
An amazing cover of "In My Own 
Time," originally from the Bee 
Gees, shows the band stili 
revelling In the pop of an era 
gone by, while also adding Its 
own style and sound. Uve shows 
often Include covers such as The 
Who's "Out In the streets," The 
Monkees' "for Pete's Sake." and 
various Beatles numbers such as 
"J'm Down" and "Savoy Truftle" 

In agreement with band 
members from the Dream 
Syndicate, Green on Red and 
The Bangles, who deny there is 
any such revival going on, 
Michael Querelo, bass player 
and singer of The Three O'Clock, 
feels that. "No one is reviving 
anything. What we are doing has 
never died:' 

Indeed this distinction ofThe 
Three O'Clock in accepting the 
"pop" label has caused much 
confusion to many listeners of 
the band. When Quercio formed 
the band The Salvation Army in 

1980, local Interest brought 
about the release of the debut 
single ("Mind Gardens" b/w 
" Happened Happened") 
followed by an IP titled simply, 
The Salvation Anny. This debut 
IP was given a lot of radio play 
by the then-underground 
Rodney Bingenheimer of KROQ. 
The band then gained a strong 
following by playing around Los 
Angeles with friends and peers 
such as the Bang{le)s and the 
Dream Syndicate. 

After adding a new drummer, 
Danny Benalr, and keyboardlst 
Mickey Mariano, the song-
writing team of Querelo and 
guitarist Gregg Gutierrez 
revamped the garage psyche-
delia onhe Salvation Army and 

produced the ep Baroque 
lloedown, nlled with sixties-
inspired pop as well as modem 
Insight. under the new name, 
The Three OÂ·Clock. 

Released on local frontIer 
Records, the [P did exception-
ally well, and proved the band 
was ready to develop Its own 
sound and Identity. 1"Iot 
forgetting Its roots, however, 
the group featured on Baroque 
lloedown a blazing cover ofThe 
Easybeat's "Sorry." (/"low also 
on Import, the french version 
includes three additional tracks 
- Pink floyd 's "Lucifer Sam," 
the Byrds' "feel a Whole Lot 
Better" and another original 
titled "In !.Dve In Too.") While

over 400 years people have been 
able to buy tIckets and spend an 
eiUoyable couple of hours 
listening to Shakespeare In the 
theater. At the same time, there 
are messages In his plays to 
explore." 

~en with the expansion of 
the television and movie 
Industries, Christmas Is not 
worried that live theater Is 
declining In public Interest and 
support. "Live theater for 
centuries has been called the 
'fabulous Invalid, ". Christmas 
laughs. However, the special 
magic that live theater uudes Is 
not present in the other media, 

The time seems right for the Three O'clock 

"The experience that you get 
in a live theater is unique, 
because It exists only for the 
moment... he says. "With 
television and movies, you have 
something that is prepared, 
shot in a studio or on location, 
edited and that Is It. Whereas In 
live theater, the play Is reborn 
every night. and the actors and 
the audience will never have 
exactly the same experience." 

In his 17 years at UCSD, 
Christmas has seen the 
deparment he originally 
established In 1967 grow Into a 
nationally-recognized profes-
sional training program. "In the 
future, I hope we ! UCSD Drama 
Department J go on presenting 
good quality theater that is 
worth doing and Is done welJ." 
he exclaims, With eric 
Christmas at work on the UCSD 
faculty, this Is a sure bet.
